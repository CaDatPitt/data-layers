. ernments at Pitt. The first two will be on Student Congress, past and
V present. The third will deal with Men’s Council and the last with

WSGA.)

By ELINORE STONE
Since its birth eight years ago, Student Congress has
been alternately damned and praised. . ~
It was established to accomplish what Pitt governing
bodies before had been attempting.

Its constitution declares that its
purpose is “to express student
opinions, foster loyalty to the Uni-
versity, promote cooperative rela-
tions between students and fac-
ulty, and study University affairs
of concern to students.” This pur-
pose as well as its accomplish-
ments have often gone unnoticed
beneath the cloak of criticism
which so often covers it.

Mistakes Overemphasized

On the same hand, its mistakes
and weaknesses have sometimes
been overemphasized. _

In the springof 1934, the Stu-
dent-Faculty Association was
formed to supplant the previous
Student Council. During the ten
years it functioned, the SFA
evolved a plan for inaugurating
freshmen customson a new basis
with no hazing or ridicule in-

volved.

In the SFA, plans for the present
Men’s Council orginated in 1936.

During the SFA_’s last year on
campus, 1943, Aldo (Ike) Icardi,
recently accused of murdering his
commanding officer in Italy, was

vice-president. Under his leader-U '

ship, a group of non-frat men cru-
saded for an equal distribution of
seats in the association between
sorority and fraternity and inde-
pendent gropus.

The proposal was passed by a
slight margin. “A Jeep a Week”
was the SFA slogan that year in
their defense stamp and bond
drive. .

The Emergency Student Gov-
ernment Association replaced the
SFA towards the end of ’43. A
farewell party was held for the
army reservists in the Commons
Room that winter as the demands
of war continued to alter student
life. During its brief existence, the
ESGA sponsored a Book Drive and

P The slates opposed to IF Coun-

Candidates-—all 93 of them-—

upon as there were last year.

Two men’s positions on Student
Congress have already been ﬁlled
by internal elections. Jack Bur-

sure-ﬁre boys in the musical play business, ﬁnally brought

three .years-recommendations that you go take a/ look at

to those who miss it.
Enduring Mosaic

With ‘‘South Pacific” Mr. Rodg-_l

given the theater a spectacularly?

While the adaptation retains a
certain _.degree of faithfulness to»
Miclr-iener’s work; the discipline and

strength to the show it also pre-

Politics Still Politics

Student elections are on today.

, In the fertile soil of student politics, candidates,
platforms, and issues have sprung up- as usual like
bad weeds. Now voters are supposed to choose.

But the fact remains--be it hidden or ,not—-
that all the maneuvering that goes on before elec-
“tions, points only toward the elec-
tion of Student Congress and
Men’s Council presidents once
the general election smoke ‘sub-
sides. ,.

At least that seems to be the I
case this year.
, Four strong candidates have ,
appeared so far who might make 
themselves available for the .
presidency of Student Congress ".-
They are Jack Burwinkle, Ross Reese, Larry Ad-
ler, and Don Milletary. Burwinkle already holds
an internally-elected seat for next year and will

I not have to face the general elections.

Right now, Burwinkle, who served as M_en’s
Council president last year, appears to be top- man
in the race for Student Congress president.

, A Any one of the others might slip in ‘as "a com-
promise candidate should the voting be deadlocked.
But Burwinkle looks like the candidate.

 It is assumed that all Student Congress candi-
dates backed by the IF Council have pledged their
presidentialivotes to Burwinkle if they..are elected.
The same holds true for some members of the Good
Humor Party. .

, And of the ﬁve members of Student Congress
already set for next year, Burwinkle could hold
as many as four votes. _ ~

g Possibly, too, there is ca tie-in between the IF
and the Good Humor slates. Four men running for

» Congress‘ have the backing of both slates. As Ross

 

said, “There is something deeper than a similarity
of names.” ,

, As far as presidential voting goes, Reese says
that “The candidates of the Merit Party are no
bound. to support “any particular nominee . . .”

At—any rate, platforms and issues are merely the
one-ninth of the different slates that are showing
above water. The big eight—ninths that is left holds
I the name of the next president of Student Con-
I gress}, ~ I

Whiiher the Woman

~ GENE WEINSTEIN

It is not generally well known,
and certainly has not been wide-
ly publicized, but the women on
campus are on the move. They
are striving to attain what they
consider to be their rightful
place in the college world of
men.

This activ-
ity is by no
means a local
p h enomenon.
All over the
land the girls
are taking up
the good ﬁght.

they are aided ’

ago, for in-

stance, the Saturday Review of
Literature ‘published a piece by
a male author entitled “The ‘Nat-
ural Superiority of Women.”

Have the women on campus

‘ been assigned the at least equal

position that their superior abil-
ities entitle them‘, to? _

Before answering this ‘ques-
tion, let us review the long strug-
gle for women’s rights during
the past, so that we may all the
better appreciate the Pitt wom-
an’s-happy lot. a

Back in the 18th century, when

everyone who counted was ac-

quiring a high degree of civiliza-
tion, women were held‘ in low

repute. -The great literary ﬁgure

of the day, Alexander Pope,
agreed with his fellows that
“women have no character at
all.” ‘D

Lord Chesterﬁeld, the gay
blade of the period, conﬁded
that,he had never known a wom-
an who acted and reasoned sen-
sibly for “four and twenty hours
together.” For the sake of ac-
curacy,_ it should be reported that

‘the urbane gentleman conceded

that women had “an entertaining
tattle, and sometimes wit . . .”

With Striped Garters. Too
Years before this, Richard
Steele breezily commented on
ladies’ dress and vahity. He told
the story of one “stuck up” dam-
sel of the day. “I did not know,”
said Steele’s informant, “what
to make of the carriage of this
fantastical girl, until I was in-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 

formed that she had“ a pair of
striped garters on.” ‘

But even back in the 18th,
there were men whose minds
transcended the limits of their
times and realized the true worth
of women. Such a man was Dan-
iel Defoe.

Defoe told a shocked 18th cen-
tury world that it ‘was “one of
the most barbarous customs in
the world . . . that we deny the
advantages of learning to wom-
en.” He called an educated wom-
an a “creature without compar-
ison.” ’

After 1 Defoe, progress was
steady and sure. We all recall
the history of women’s suffrage,
of thefair sex’s entrance into all
phases of public life, and ofthe
wide-spread education for wom-
envthat has ensued.

Yet the liberation from men

has been far from“ complete. At .

many schools, Pitt included, the
gals fail to get their money’s
worth. ‘ .

Blind Alley for Femmes

Pitt girls, unlike their sisters
at Carnegie Tehh, may not be-
come cheerleaders. Unlike Tech
and Duquesne, they may not
form a riﬂe team. Unlike Alle-
gheny, they may not perform on
a varsity sport, even though of
equal ability with men, and no

. , facilities are available for a sub-

stitute program. .

In Student Congress, the wom-
enlhave less seats than the men,
and so are powerless to bring
about any changes to help them-
selves. As Nancy Tear, a mem-
ber of this year’s Congress says,
“If any favorable legislation for
women were brought to a vote,
the men would crush us under
their heels.”

Despite their many disadvan-

tages, the gals keep going about

their business in an orderly fash-
ion. The girls as a group are
friendly and courteous, and do
not show signs of widespread
discontent. '

Perhaps they see into the fu-
ture, and picture a Cyrillia
Wecht and Roberta Gardner
roaming about the 12th ﬂoor col-
laborating, as usual. Then, as
they know, Women’s _Day will

' have come.

Vote may  a

Every year at this time the current ed-

yitor of the News exhorts the populace to get

out and vote. There are usually vague and
even noble allusions to civic duty, communi-
ty responsibility, school spirit, an occasional
hint at the grandeur that was Rome’s and an
ogllier polysylabic abstraction readily avai-
a e. «

A brief" glance through back copies of the
News indicates that these heroics have little
effect on the total number of ballots cast.
There seems to be a relativly stationary num-
ber of candidates offering themselves for ap-
proval.

This year the number of candidates fig-
ures out to something like .76 per cent of
the entire fulltime population. If each of the
86 candidates can convince 20 fellow-students

to go to the polls, the_percen.tage turnout will

be the greatest in local history. .
The large number of candidates who have

. answered the call of civic duty oifersthe vot-

er a Wi e ‘selection from which to choose.
The unu’ ually large number does not mean
that there are more. good men than in the

past, but it does seem to suggest that there is ‘ I

more interest than at any other time.

This year, as in any other year, the elec-
tions will be dominated by .the slates, all of
which contain some Worthwhile individuals
and some who are not «so impressive. The

candidates on the slates will, of course, come,

off victorious. _ s

It would be difficult to say which slate
contains the, men who should be elected be-
cause not oneof the 86 candidates is so su-
perior to his opponents that he could be
singled out as the... man to lead Pitt, to great-

. er things. The only signiﬁcant differences
between the candidates are their ages, classes’

and sexes. We would not stoop to discrimin-
ating in favor of men—-mainly because the
women are not competing with them.
Being inclined towards realism, we shall
not exhort you to vote, even though we feel
that you should. If you are going to sheer
and jeer-at the legislators, you at least ought
towexpress your opinion by voting. Now is

‘your chance. i »
 , GET OUT AND VOTE.

Yes -- Political Clubs  

The University’s committee on recogni-
tions last week declined to approve political
clubs. Theﬁrst direct effect of its action was
to bar the student body from actively par-
ticipating in yesterday’s primary elections.
Thus the clubs were unable to demonstrate
on a small scale Whether they are as good as
some people say or as bad as some other
people claim. I p ’

But we hope that those students who are
interested in the clubs »will not let ‘one de-
feat deter them. They should continue to
campaign for the idea of political clubs as
vigorously as they would now be campaign-
ing for one of the presidential candidates.

None of the reasons advanced against the

clubs are sufficiently persuasive to prevent .

them from being eventually recognized. It
is signiﬁcant that the age-old fear of an ap-
propriation cut was not even mentioned by
the committee. C

In order for the clubs to ﬁnally win recog-
nition, however, they must gain the support»

of more students, especially those who are

in the legislative bodies. For it was these
students who failed to throw their support
behind the clubs.

Both Student Congress and Men’s Coun-
cil failed to take any action on the clubs.

The motion in Congress was tabled one time _

and when it came up for discussion again,
no one felt strong enough about the proposal
to second a motion to take it off the table.

Congress should serve as a focal point

for such proposals. If the Congress now in,
ofﬁce remains unconcerned about the clubs, ‘
then their promoters must wait until a new ‘

Congress takes office. Surely, they will put

pressure on the committee to approve the‘

clubs.‘

Before any ofﬁcials are elected to head
either’Men’s Counci1.or Student Congress,
they should express themselves on the poli-
tical clubs issue. The old groups let an ex-
cellent opportunity to enlarge the horizons
of the student body go by, and for no good

reason. If they have a good, reason, we “

haven’t heard it. ,

If The‘Pitt_News is backing any candi-
dates in, this election, they age those who
supported the clubs. We are very deﬁnitely

Pitt’s lone entry in the Olympic ﬁnals at Ames, Iowa

the home crowd.

It’s obvious that a tennis team
doesn’t go to Indiana or a track
team to Virginia for peanuts. ‘Of
course the wrestling team made
several trips which cost the Ath-
letic Department a few dollars.

Panthers Monopolize Trials
It seems that everyone con-
cerned except the public knew
that Pitt was mildly defrauding
the public’ by entering a full team.
For example, if the other Penn-
sylvania 'winner—Len _DeAugus-
t_ino-——of Lock Haven State Teach-
ers would have lost to a Pitt man
at the Field House, then no one
yvould have beneﬁted. M
True, the. other six, excluding
Joe Solomon and Charley Uram,
may not have copped a title, but
they would have gained plenty
of experience. .
If the University has enough
moneyto schedule year-after-year

fairs, then there should have been

enough cash to. send the wrestlers
who rightfully deserved the honor.

PiKA Cops First Game,
Down Phi Kaps, 11-5

Pi Kappa Alpha inaugurated the interfraternity softball
season with a bang Monday as it scored nine runs in the
ﬁrst three innings -to go on and whip Phi Kappa’s, 11-5. I

was the ﬁrst game of the season€r -

for both teams. ,

PiKA started off with five runs
in the first, added three more in
the second, and one in the third to
never be threatened. Phi Kaps
rallied for two runs in the seventh
but it was too little and too late.

Leading the winnersat bat was
Dick Stanko who had two -hits and
two RBI’s. Both teams had only
nine hits but the PiKA’s also re-
ceived eight bases on balls. Dick
McHugh got two b-ingles for the
Phi Kaps in their losing effort.

. The PiKA’s were in the softball
playoffs last year and they're off

and winging towards this year’s .

ﬁnals. . _
The 1eague’s opener was similar

to last year’s high-scoring fracasps‘

and also ended like most games in
the dark.

IM Athletes
Meet Tech  

Pitt’s intramural athletes per-
form out-of-bounds so to be speak,
when they meet Carnegie Tech’s
IM stars in ping pong and swim-
ming. .

The ping pong matches will be
played tonight at the Stadium. The
swimming meet, previously sched-

uled at Tech’s pool tomorrow, has

been postponed to next week. V

It will be the fourth such ping-
pong engagement for the two
schools. Pitt won all three previ-
ous meetings, but by very . close
margins.

Since Tech didn’t have an IMP

swimming meet in previous years,

 

the pool engagement will be the
ﬁrst of its kind. _

IM Director ‘Leo Bemis ‘an-
nounced that Ed Stone, Mickey
Steiner and Costos Lambrinas are
deﬁnite starters today. Three
other pongers will be selected from
ﬁve hopefuls: Chuck Coffey, Sam
Bass, Ed Malloy, Tom Flint, and
Reinhart Leo.

Stone and Norty Freedel are cer-
tain to play doubles. Bemis has

yet to name the other doubles
teams.

Two relay teams and two indi-
vidual tankers represent Pitt
against the Tartans.

Sigma Chi captured the frater-
nity championship for the third
consecutive year. One fraternity
swim record was set when Joe
Depelheur, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
swam the breaststroke in 23.7,
erasing his own mark of 24.5.

Hitting Sparks‘ ,  

O O O ’

F Lrst M in Wm

The potential hitting pow-
er that Pitt’s baseball team
didn’t show in its opener
with Ohio University exploded last
Saturday, and as a result, the
Panthers copped their ﬁrst game
of the season, beatingwestminste
.12-4. " 

Besides the impressive 1'3-hit
attack, hurler Bill Warnick in-
dicated he may be Coach Ralph‘
Mitterling’s chief stopper after
blanking the Titans for four in-‘

nings. ’ i
The little righthander replaced _

starter Bob Russell in the sixth
frame and was credited with the
Win. ‘a.

The Panthers hope to do.as" well

this weekend when they resume
against Georgetown, ate ‘

action
Washington, D.C. Friday and Navy
at Annapolis Saturday.

Mitterling ‘ will probably use
southpaw Ray Hollis and frosh

righthander Don Shanafelt since _

neither pitcher has worked as yet.

Prof Spends 28 Years Writing Boo
I By JOAN THOMAS
Many people complain about wordy dictionaries as much
as they complain about the weather, but do nothing about

it. One Pitt professor is an exception to the rule.
Dr. Michael Angelo DeVitis, head of the Spanish depart-

ment at Pitt, has been work-

ing on a Spanish, dictionary

for 28 years. He expects to

have it ready for publication

in 1955.

If you took Spanish in one of
Pittsburgh’s high schools, you
probably used one of his 20 Span-

ish grammars that he has written _

and edited since the _age of 23.

Two of these were published’ in

Spain and sold in Latin America.
Unique Ideas

V

the dictionary in use inadequate
and deﬁcient..
Contains More Words
The professor’s completed dic-
tionary will contain more Spanish
American terms than any existing

VDr. DeVitis plans to make his  —

dictionary unique by giving exam-
ples of the usage of each word,
instead of listing 12 or more mean-
ings, all confusing to a foreigner.
He recalled an incident that
happened years ago to a company
in Chicago which sold carriages.
It sent pamphlets to Puerto Rico
advertising their popular “single
‘horse buggies.” By literal trans-
lation, the baffled Puerto Rican’s
thought these to be “lousy bach-
elor horses.” I
In 1913, while teaching the sub-
ject in El Paso, Texas, Dr. DeVitis
began to keep at record of Spanish

words not found in the standard ‘

dictionary. .
. Collected New Words

He became accustomed to scan-
ning a book and picking out new
words. He jotted them on the back
of envelopes or scraps of paper,
until he found time to, transfer
them to small cards which he ﬁrst
kept only as a hobby.

'He has since reviewed 5,000-
Spanish books, newspapers, and
magazines in this manner.

' Dr. DeVitis was inspired to
‘write his own Spanish dictionary
in 1924, during his ﬁrst year of
teaching at Pitt. The Ptofessor of
Spanish American Literature and
Spanish Composition considered

 

bi-lingual dictionary. And he will
omit archaic, highly technical, and
commercial terms.

It will contain 100,000 uncom-
mon words which differ in, mean-
ing or do not exist at all in the

Candidates Set _

Approximately 2,079 candidates
forgraduation are preparing for
commencement exercises on the
Cathedral lawn on June 11.

All candidates have been ask-
ed to clear up any incomplete
grades and to ﬁll out cards for
each course in which they are

presently enrolled. Cards must be

returned and grades completed no
later than Thursday, Apr. 24 and
returned to the Registrar’s oﬁice.

Student Congress Knocked, Laudedi

(Continued from Page 1)
RedCross Drive.‘ And then, it too
died.

SC Born

Out of; the remaining fragments
of the ESGA, Student Congress
was born. Since then it had its
share of ups and downs. The his-
tory of SC reads like an adventure
story. _, A

To foster a more friendly at-
mosphere at Pitt, SC inaugur-
ated an “Hello-Week” in 1946
during which time every student
was to be extra cheery and help-
ful to his fellow man. They
hoped that this week would be-
come a. Pitt tradition. It has
never reappeared.

As a result of one dance held in
’48, SC went $235.50 in the hole.
When a power strike hit Pitts-
burgh in ’47, SC stepped in and
helped the desperate commuters
get to school. They organized a
car pool and distributed “I go to
Pitt” placards to get all potential
student hitchhikers to Oakland.

‘ Political Feuds

A governing body just can’t
seem to function without a politi-
cal feud now and then. In April
'49, after a decisive fraternity vic-
tory in the Men’s Council elections,
the Independents charged the vic-
tors with stuﬁing the ballot boxes.
A recount was taken and the

n-......

fraud charges dropped. The IF

d

faction, incidently, had called itseh‘.
the “All-Student Party."
Booze Stand Hit

SC’s stand on drinking, evident
this year in its efforts to do away
with the bottle at Pitt football
games and Socials, offended at
least one of its legislators in ’49.
This item appeared in the April
first issue of the Pitt News: “Tom
Ryan, advocate of beer at univer-
sity functions, resigned from SC
Tuesday . . .”

Then there was the time when,
in the Fall of ’47, after a 69-0 Pitt
football loss to the University of
Michigan, SC began an‘ athletic
probe into the university’s sports
policy.

Led by a former member’ of
the football squad, Bob Dickey,
SC was concerned with the
question “Why don’t We get the
players that our opponents do?”

After a six month-long probe by
the University Faculty Committee,
a temporary Student-Alumni Ath-
letic Committee, and a Trustee
Committee, little more was done
than to form a new athletic com-

mittee and call for easier schedules
in the future.
