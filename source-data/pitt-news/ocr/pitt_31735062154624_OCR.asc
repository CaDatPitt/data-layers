Kline Autographs Egg—
Neophyte Saves Neck

The quest of the golden egg,
though in this particular case
the egg was not golden but of
the common goose type,‘ was
re-enacted last week when
Howard Hazlett, Bus.,Ad. ’32,
Kappa Sigma pledge‘ was or-
dered to have a goose egg
signed by" Hon.’ Mayor Kline.
- Saturday morning Neophyte
Hazlett obtained his egg at a
Fifth avenue market and pro-
ceeded to the Mayor’s oﬂice.
He_ was met at the door by the
secretary who welcomed him.
On his being admitted to the
Sanctus Sanctorum, Mayor
Kline readily endorsed the egg

and‘ wished Hazlett. “Good
Luck.” -
_ Before going on the goose-

‘ egg search, Hazlett and three
other neophyteswere taken out
.to Universal, Pa. (the cement
plants) and left there with in-
structions to talk to no one.
The pledges slept in the wait--
ing room all night and in the
morning the stationmaster took
pity on them and. drove them
to. the city. As» soon he Haz-
lett came to town he wentto
market, bought his egg and
made his way to the ’Mayor’s
office. , , V

DELAYETD VOTES-

Committees Unable To Tally
Ballots Until Tomorrow;
One Week Late 

 

 

RECORD voTE: PREDICTED

Mailing Of“-Ballots To
Co-op Engineers 

 

Candidates in last Friday’s' gen-
era-l school elections and the gen-
eral student body waited impatient-
ly in vain this week for results of
the voting._ The ballots have not
yet. been counted, and will not be
counted until tomorrow,‘ one week
after the day‘ previously set for this
purpose. v

Failure of the elections commit-
tee of the school of engineering to

co-operative work until election day
necessitated‘ the delay in the count-
ing. These students, many of whom
work outside Pittsburgh, could not
send in their votes on time fora
count last week. Their ballots have
been. coming in all week and will
be valid if they are received today.
John C.
dent of Student Council, gave an
additional reason for the delay. Re-
marking that the constitution de-

vise. the counting, he said it’ had
proved impossible for this commit-
tee to meet at any time between
last Saturday and tomorrow. The
elections were supervised by the
Student Council elections commit-
tee, headed by Betty Clark, Ed. ’29.
chairman. . ~.
Miss Clark stated the postpone-
ment was made in fairness both to
the candidates andthe co-operative
students. Seventy-ﬁve votes are ex-
cated. . .‘
In commenting on the elections,
Miss Clark said they were conduct-
ed most satisfactorily with no ap-
parent indication of ‘any’ of the “ir-
regularities” which /'marked
year’s voting. She predicted 9. rec-
ord total vote.  ,
Unusual «interest was «shown in
C3o"un.cil, where. thirty-nine candi-
dates strove for twelve oﬂ*‘ices.*'B.e-
sides council positions, offices of the
various schools and associations of
the University were to be ﬁlled,
with chief interest centered in the

ministration associations. A total
of one hundred four students ran
for office. '

’ Game Must Be Made
Early,‘

 

Reservations. for the Pitt-Ohio
State homecoming game, to .be
played November 2 are greater than
or-any other game ever played at
the »University,- states George I,

. Cars-on, alumni secretary. Requests
’- for tickets

have - come into‘ the
Alumni office from Pitt and Ohio
State alumni and ‘friends and su _-
porters of both teams. ' A- comm t-
tee” of alumni headed by Thomas A.
Thornton, H. L. V. Fullerton and

working out plans “for. alumni at-

ment. -

Cleveland, ‘Youngstown, Akron"
and many s1’na11er_toWns,in Ohio, are
represented among the early ticket
applicants, while‘ many Pitt follow-
ers havewritten-toV.«Di'rector W. Don
Harrison to hold seats for them-on
the “ﬁfty-yard line.” The opportu-
nity is also
Western Co erence schools to buy
tickets ‘in the special section al-
lotted them. This section islocated
next to the‘ Ohio‘ State alumni res-
ervation and it is expected that hun-
dreds of seats in the Western Con-
ference section will be taken by‘Illi-
nois, Chicago Northwestern; Iowa,
Wisconsin,“ u r d u e, , Minnesota,
Michigan and . Indiana graduates.

Asidefrom -the fact that the com-
mittees in charge are making ex-,
ceptional preparations to entertain
the visiting Ohioans, and to bring
back a large number of Pitt gradu-
ates, the game is attractive to foot-.
ball followers because it marks the
ﬁrst appearance of‘ the colorful
Scarlet and Gray eleven in--Western
Pennsylvania. The Ohio State
team is one of the leading elevens
in‘ the Western. Conference. Pitt
alumni hope that this game. will be
the beginning of a lasting relation-
ship between the two neighboring
universities. - Many graduates _ of
the Buckeye school have expressed
the hope that the Scarlet and Gray
eleven .meet the Golden Panthers
annually on Homecoming Day.

‘With every fraternity on the
campus inviting its,Ohio State chap-

Tech extending the same invitations
it appears that Pitt will play host
to one of the greatest football
crowds that will visit Pittsburgh.

- A committee from the interfrater-

nity council including representa-
tives of the professional school
chapters, is. now sending out invi-
tations and completing publicity
plans. C. R. Wilson, assistant dean
of men,'is co-operating with this
committee.  . .~ I

FRESHMAN CAPTAIN

Lloyd Cochrane, a freshman
in the school of Business Ad-
m_inistr_ation, was named cap-
tain of this year’s freshman
swimming team that finished _a
mediocre season winning 15 and
losing 7 ‘contests. I

Formerly of Eric, I Lloyd
graduated from Erie'East High.
where he made, quite a groove,
in aquatic circles. During the
past season he was not once
nosed out by an opponent in his
specialty, -the 100-yard, breast _
stroke, and on. several occasions
he established himself ‘as a
free-styler of merit.

In the recent Pitt champion-
ships, Lloyd pulled a surprise
on the veterans and . won the
220-yard breast stroke. He is
one of those “go-getter” boys
and great things are expected»
‘of him during his next three-
years at'Pitt. ’

VARSITY CAPTAIN ,
Albert Mango, a freshman in
the Medical school and a mem-
ber of Phi Beta Pi, is the re-
tiring captain of the’Panther
Mermen. Al hails from Erie
and has held the local limelight
time and again. _

Records have fallen as the
leaves in autumn when Al in-
vades the territory of rival
tankers. He holds records at
Erie, Lafayette, Wooster, Notre.
Dame, Allegheny and Carnegie-
Tech, in addition to annexing.

oints for the team by his fancy

‘vim; andzmeritorious work on
the relay team. ..

As a crowning achievement
to his‘ stellar career, Al was
awarded the Harry Quig Tay-
lor Memorial trophy this_year.

. This trophy is representative of
the highest honor bestowed
upon‘ a Pitt swimmer.

  The Campus Scout

What our basketball editor ran. as
a mere detail recently developed
into the best football news‘ so far
as Pitt is concerned that has broken
here’ in ‘many a moon. This notice
which was ‘included in a story can-

‘ cerning the possibility of the Pitt

basketball team playing an exhibi-
tion game this spring at Detroit,
contained the following: (“Don Har-
rison, director of athletics, while on
a business trip to Nebraska this
week-end to complete arrangements
for the Panther-Cornhusker football
game next fall, stopped over for- a

short stay in Chicago to. review the 

‘details for the Chicagvo -meet.”

-’--0-An
This little trip of Mr. Harri-
. s_on"s developed -into nothing

[else but ,a three-year contract "4" 

whereby Pitt will play Nehras--
ka for the next three years. The p
’ ﬁrst two games will be played
at Lincoln, Nebraska, and the
third one in 1931 will be staged
on the Pitt ﬁeld. Although. Pitt-
. “has played Nebraska three .
times, this agreement marks the
opening of a. new era between
Pitt and Nebraska.- This is the
first time ‘that -the Pitt athletic
heads have drawn up a three-
year agreement with any west- '
em school.‘ -
Much. credit must- be given Mt»
Harrison for his efforts in bringing
about the permanent relations‘. with
a school that produces the type of

teams, Nebraska does. ' And on the”

other hand, Athletic Director Her-
bert D. Gish of the Cornhuskers no
doubt deserves a big _h_and for mak-
ing the three-year arrangement
possible. Several weekswbefore the’
Pitt-Nebraska game this past- sea-
son, Mr. Gish stopped, at the Pitt
athletici/oﬂice on l'l1S. way to com-
lste ﬁnal ‘arrangements for the
ebraska-Army game at ' New
York. Your scout had the pleasure
of talking‘ to Mr. Gish who is an
extremely. likeable chap and who
had nothing butpraise for the Pitt
athletic_ autho1'iti.es and football
team. _
He regarded the Pitt game as
one of the biggest games of the .
season for the Huskers. To .
bear this out, your scout picked
up the Nebraska Daily the
‘ other day and noticed in the ac-
count of the Nebraska spring
grid training that Coach Dana
X. Bible has christened his sec-
ond team “Pittsburgh.” And
the funny thing about the
thing was that “Pittsburgh”
trimmed the varsity Husker
team. From this account it
can be readily seen that Ne-
braska has already set its eye
on avenging, the defeat Pitt.
handed them here two years
ago. and the scoreless. tie
played at Lincoln during the
past season.

———O_—— ‘

Fans may object to the fact that
the sensational Husker team will
not show here this year andthat
Pitt Wlll play there two consecutive
years, the local fans not having a
chance to -watch the Huskers until

Hi! i

  
 
       
  

Ed

two years hence. But when we con-
sider that Nebraska. has played in
Pittsburgh on two different occa-
sions; in 1921 when, Nebraska
trimmed Pitt 10 to 0 over at_Forbes
Field, and in=1927 when Pitt got
revenge 21. to 13_ at l3l'le‘P1l}l3 sta-
dium we realize that it is logical
that ‘Pitt should travel to Lincoln.
Only once -have the Panthers gone
to~.Linco1n and that was last year
when they held the powerful Husk-
ers to a scoreless tie.
. _, __O___

And also, for those-fans and
students who can’t wait until.
1931 to see the Nebraskans, we
must consider that Pitt is shar-
ing the stadium with Carnegie
Tech for the next ﬁfteen years.
One -of: -the biggest. attractions
of Pittsburgh football .will be
staged at the stadium October
19, when. the Panthers." are
carded toplay at Lincoln. Car» -
negie-Tech meets their tradi- ‘
tional rivals, Wash-Jeff, at the
Pitts stadium on that date. _
When the ‘Pitt team travels to

I Lincoln this fall, the well wishes of

thousands of students and rooters
will accompany them. Yet, it is not
too earlyto think about a‘ special
train to Lincoln for the Pitt. stu-
dents. Efforts to arrange. for a
“special-” «last year failed, but if
some campus organization, such as
Student Council ‘gets busy very
shortly it is highly probable that
the Pitt’. student ‘body will be able
to sit right .in on the ‘Nebraska-
Pitt‘ game instead of hearing. the
score) between periods at the Car-
negie-Wash—Jeif game. "in the sta-
dium. ' »

 

The editor has informed your
Scout that.this' is the last time his
coiumn will appear this year.

Before closing we wish to say
good-bye to Mr. Harrison, may he
have a full stadium every Saturday
vthisfalil; to Don Saunders, may his
Pitt athletic‘ pulblicity be published
from coast to coast; to Charley Hy-
att, may he remain just as good as
he is; to Alec. Fox, may his Oil City
boys" learn just what he knows
about football; _Luby DiMeolo, may
Grantland Rice learn to spell his
name correctly,
other friends in Pitt athletics whose
friendship we have been fortunate
to cultivate. under our elusive dis
guise-—-‘1‘vhe' Campus Scout. ~ *

w e .1: Virginia, Defending
Champs, Given Chance
To Triumph

 

Tomorrow afternoon the Pitt
trackmen will make their last ap-
pearance in the stadium. The third
annual Big Four meet will be held

in the Pitt stadium and West Vir-

fending champions.

Last‘ year the Mountaineers
brought a well balanced team" .to
the stadium, and won’ the title al-

tainers. were able to pile“ up enough
seconds and thirds tof. beat Shea’s
men. out-by a few points. This
year they have the. some chance.
Again Pitt is the favorite‘ due to
their victories over the West Vir-
g'_1lll8l‘lS in a dual meet. and their
victory over State last Saturday.
‘The Mountaineers are «going. to
_ harder this
year. Pitt will present a. much
better balanced team. In the sprints,
the 100, 220. and 440, the -Panthers
are exceptionally strong. Pete
Bowen heads a list, of men. who can
be expected tojtake plenty of oints.
Utterback, Doverspike and - IcCul-
lough will present a much j better
supportinglvcast than was furnished
Wibecan last year.

In thehurdles it will bathe same.
Marsh-all Lewis will give Knoblock
lots-of help in both .,hurd1es. Knobby
won the highs last year but was
beaten out by Smith of Wash-Jeﬂ’
in the lows. These two will meet
again in the ﬁnals tomorrow.

In, the pole vault, high jump and
broad jump, the Panther superiority
is almost. as marked as it is in the
sprints. Vic Pickard and Utter-
back will take the nrst‘ in "these
events, and the latter will be aided
by Lewis and Lamphear.

In the weights, West. Virginia is
expected to gain a slight advan-
tags. Don Gwinn is the best bet in
the hammer but in the ‘shot and dis-
cus the Mountaineers are strongly
fortiﬁed. Keefer will probably take
second in the (hammer, ‘ and Hill,
Goldstein and Kitchener will gather

shot. " a

‘(In the distance runs, Riley,
Young and ‘Brand of » the. Moon-
taineers will ﬁght it out with Al-
berts, Caesar‘ and Jerpe of ‘Pitt.
