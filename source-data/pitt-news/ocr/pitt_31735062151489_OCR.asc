leventh Production

The Cap A and iGown show. com-
pleted its eleventh year as a Pitt
activity by presenting its annual pro-
duction at the Schenley theatre. Al-
though a number of last year’s stars
were missing, the club this year pre-
sented an interesting and novel en-
tertainment. The show was staged
in the form of aA vaudeville bill.

George McLare-n, Pitt's all-Ameri-
can’ fullback, was featured in three
of the eight acts of the show. As‘
Lieutenant Edwards rn the one act-
play. “The Traitor,” he showed his
rl_ramatiAc ability in enacting one of
the difficult roles of Percival Wilde's
war play. His ditty on t'he Pitt uni-
forms struck a chord in,the heart of
the Pitt ‘students present, thatburst
forth. in enthusiastic approval.’ A

Of the- other stars of last ‘year Sorg
won over the aurdienceby ‘his’ clever-
feminine make-up.‘ Ben Levant, com-
poser of the score, was at the piano

dered several songs.
former member of the Mask and Wig
at Penn, as a female impeisonator

tet. He created considerable, amuse-
ment by singing a love ballad to

The Show opened with a short act,"
“The Awkward Squad," who per-

formedA some ludicrous military man- _

This was followed -by the

 estimates are that a new design
would '4 cost the members of the
class _betWeerf ten and twelve dollars
and under the present plan the best
ring will be but eight.dollars and a
quarter vvith'the war tax.

‘It is desirable to getithe orders in
as soon. as possible so. that the ﬁn-
Aished rings may be‘ delivered before
CommAenAcAement Day. Last year
there was a great deal of diﬂiculty
and. dissatisfaction due to the late
date at which the orders were ‘placed.
Someiof the rings had to be delivered
after graduation and someof the peo-
ple were never able to get their rings.
i In order to push the thing through
the representative of the E. A.

Lieutenant Bruno Roselli -of the_
Italian Alpine troops, and formerly
3 Professor at Adelphia Universrty,’

Brooklyn, delivered an addressl on 

“Italy and the War,”
assembly last Thursday.

Unlike other war «speakers -which A

the University students have had “the
DFlVl1eg‘e of hearing, Lieut. ‘Roselli
did not dwell on the life and every
day happenings of the trenches, but
upon Italy as a nation and why she;
entered this conﬂict.
He said in pin;
American and European, have had in

their minds for some time the notion . -

thatAItaly entered the war for wealth,
for greaterpower, and for additional
territory. But this ‘idea is without-
any foundation whatsoever. If Italy
wanted ‘wealth they would have
stayed out of the war and reaped the
harvest of foreign commerce. If it
were for power, she would have re-
fused to ﬁght; and by having saved
her men, food, and wealth she would
now be the- most feared nation in
Europe. If it were for land, well,
Germany and Austria offered her all
the land Italy ever wanted,’to stay .
out of the war. But had she kept s
out of the war and become powerful‘
and wealthy and large she would be
unrespected and termed cowardly.
Lieutenant Roselli is an Italian by
birth, havingAcome to this country
when a mere boy. He received all
of his education in the American,
schools. Soon after his mother
country declared war on German;-, "
he resigned his position as professor .

and. entered the Italian army as 
private.  'overA.there Awithj ~'_the“f'

“After the W... all the nations will

of regulation,” said Dr. Laidler, at
the meeting held last Tuesday. Dr.
Laidler came here from New York as’
the representative of the Intercolleg-
iate Socialist society of which the
Pitt social science club is a shapter.

He explained that all the nations
were increasing their power in regulat-
ing_ those industries which demanded
government attention and/he showed
‘how this would be increased after
He traced the progress
along these lines before the war In
England, France and the United
States and showed the reasons. for
the continuance oi Igreater federal
regulation by the ,government after
the war; _

Dr. Laidler‘ travelled in Europe be-
fore the «war broke out and'~he was
abl‘ei'to study the conditions and the-
demands that the government and
the ,people were making‘along this‘
line. Dr. ‘Laidler is also an. authority
on. co—operatiAve work andhas written.
several books on this subject. He
has just completed‘ a new book on
