Townsend Analyzes Failure

 Evaluation Try Fizzles .

by STEVE LUBETSKY

I Student response to thecourse
evaluation "experiment has-been
extremely" disappointing. ’Never—
, theless, Physics Professor John
R. Townsend. Faculty Adviser
of‘ the Course Evaluation Com-
mittee. seems determined to
complete compilation of a course
analysis catalogue.

Dr.‘ Townsend attributes the
poor response to widespread
skepticism among students. _“For
seven years now course evalua-
tion has been in. operation. but
it never had any carry-over".
asserts Dr. Townsend. This is be-
cause very few students can af-

- ford to donate their time to help
tabulate the results.

“Consequently, ‘students "be-
lieve that such projects are mean-
ingless." _ I

J Townsend compared this lack
of enthusiasm to the abstention
" from political action. “Many

people refrain from participat-

ing - because they doubt the -

efficacy‘ of a single vote or
opinion. Yet one is confronted
_’ ,,with,the fact that votes and let-

The Physics professor under-
lined the importance of -course
evaluation in informing the stu-
dent what courses to take and the
impact it has exerted on faculty
members. "I have personally
seen even the sporadic and very
limited course evaluations at
Pitt alter the basic structure of
courses. the selection of reading
matter. and even the recommen-
dation of faculty for promotion."
he stated.

The incorpﬁration of electronic

computers as a means of hasten- '

ing returns gives Dr. Townsend
optimism about the future.
"Computers will enable us to
process the cards more efficient-
ly. thus attracting more_volun-
teers to serve on the committee.

..“Furthermore, we will be able '

to conduct the evaluation on a
regular basis. Hopefully, this
convenience will generate great-

er student support.”
Meanwhile. however. the

must rely on a very light re-
sponse. Dr. Townsend. justify-

Search For General Studies Head Continues

Committee Seeks Dean 

by SUE HOENSTINE

About twenty persons attended
open hearings last Wednesday
with the search committee ap-
pointed to find a new dean for
the School of General Studies.
The , discussion and nomination
session, held in the Social Room
of the Stephen Foster Memorial,
centered on qualifications for
the position and questions con-
cerning the selection procedure.

Eugene Davis, Coordinator of
Urban action in the Office of Ur-
ban and Community Services,
and Eugene E. Heidi, who has

‘ been an administrator at the New
. Kensington

Campus of Penn
State University and involved
with the NAACP, were nominat-
ed for the post.

'Prior to the nominations Dr.
Jack Birch, associate dean of the
School, of Education and Chair-
man of the search committee,
stated that the Chancellor will
make the final selection.'Birch
stressed that the committee was

“Unlgsponsive legislature.”

by MICHAEL SIMON
Photographs by Nick Laver

The $70 per term tuition raise
for" Pennsylvania residents an-
nounced by the Chancellor in his
July 1 letter caused varying re-
actions in University students
surveyed randomly by the Pitt
News.

Some respondents blamed the
tuition hike on the State Legis-
lature.

Curt Robinson stated, “The
raise is not necessary because

- the Legislature ’should' supply

the funds. It is obvious -that this
will cut down on out of state
students".

Bob Dove agreed, maintaining ’

that, “Its the cause of an_ unre-
sponsive Legislature.”

Arthur Trio, pointed out that,

   

from the community concerning
the School of General Studies
and in accepting possible sugges-
tions for leadership. The follow-
ing qualifications for the per-

spective dean were outlined by

Birch :

—give4n past evidence of the
ability to manage a large,
complex academic unit;

—commitment to the general
goals of University students,
especially part-time students;

—an interest in the eradication
of racial and social injustice
and the improvement of the
urban and "industrial environ-
ment of the Pittsburgh re-
gion;

- —ability to work effectively
with ‘all sectors and groups
in the urban, rural, and in-
dustrial complex of South-
western Pennsylvania.

Dr. Norman Dixon, associate
dean of the University Commun-
ity Educational Program, point-
ed out that “the dean should

A second group of students
wondered where they could get
money to pay the raise.

Noel Freudberg reflected, “It
was $750 per term when I start-
ed; now I don't know how« I
could pay it. It's a real drag.”

“It's a real drag” __

A more serious problem was
mentioned by Mary Lou Mc-
Donough. Said Mary,- “I’ll have
to transfer to a community col-

‘lege because I don’t have the
money. I’ll never take a loan be-
cause they are too hard to pay
vbacki"

A third reaction expressed by
many students, was typified by
the reply of John’Johnson. “I’m

‘ He added that “a grave ‘dang-f
er exists unless the committee‘_
develops an open criteria for the '
dean and makes the criteria and .

shouted in campuses across, the -
country—involve the people.” ‘

A plea for black student rep-
resentation was made -by Thom-* _
as Sawyer, a General Studies;
student. Sawyer pointed out that
“the School of General Studies]
is the perfect facility of the Uni-.
versity to handle the problems ._
coming in from the urban area.”f

Dr. Ina Braden, president 70f‘
the University Committee forf
Womens’ Rights, asked whether”
any of the committee members-’
considered themselves to be fem
inists and questioned whether;
the committee felt that being a-
feminist was part of the quali-2
fications. One committee mem-;
ber replied “I think we all do.”

James -Kunen's success story
is revolutionary all right. Indeed.

sales, it seems that Jerry Rubin

him. One can amend Time and say
that the central thesis of it all is
that the kids are only in it for the
sexy action so that they can get to
the sexy money.

MGM, however, never did care
about motive. If they think it’s

it is all the same in technicolor.

ideologically pure.” And the mon-

Wait Til It’s Real|yAProblem

by BRUCE PRAGER
Environmental Action/ZPG

_On April 22, 1970, the United
States participated in the first
Environmental Teach-In. It was a
success, only for that day.

Other than that it has been a
b failure because people have re-
verted back to their quondam
‘thinking. “It doesn‘t affect me
now, wait till its really a prob-
. lem." -
Well my friend, it is really a
_ problem now. The end is near and
in many cases is already here.

“.As modern man progresses the‘

Land usage is being spoiled by
highways and stockpiles of gar-
bage. And in recent years the lev-
el of noise has increased to such a
degree it is causing physiological

This past Saturday. our coun-
. ttry celebrated another birthday.
Independence Day. as July
Fourth is called. was celebrated
by the people of our country in
many different ways. and re-
flected the deep rift in Ameri-
can social and political life.

To a great majority of Ameri-
cans. the Fourth was a day of
flags and‘ fireworks. Others
thought back to the first Fourth
of July. when the founders of
our country broke the bonds of

. English tyranny to establish a‘
new country of the people. ‘by

Gene The Marine

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor
Gene the Marine is alive and
free. Out of jail. and out of

trouble for the first time in a
year. More weight. less hair and
with eyesockets now that don't
betray fear and hunger.

It's a monumental change for
a measly year's length of time.
But that was back when Gene
the Marine had decided to take
an extendedd vacation from the
Corps. back when he first found
out that they were going to send
him to Vietnam. /

Gene paradoxed his way
through life. stepping on ‘this
side._ stepping ‘over that. He was
not political.

GENE preferred to be called
EUGENE. his given name. But
no one ever followed his wishes.
He was always Gene the Marine.
a character. It had a rhythmic
sound. poetic. like its bearer‘. And
as honest as he was.

Now it must be understood
that Gene the Marine was not
honest in the traditional sense.
Far be it f'rom reality. Legally
he was a ————. But he had the
distinction of being honest in his
indulgences.

Gene's morality was existen-
tial. “I'll tell you why I got out
of the Marine Corps. I was chick-
en. man. I don't want to get kill-

/ .

ed." That was Gene. the one
who alternated between Alfred
Hitchcock and Ronald Laing for
his reading fare.

BUT Campus was the thing. I
don't remember il' Gene the Ma-
rine ever read the text. but he
did more: he lived it. Gene
wasn't exactly The Stranger; he
was too kind for that: he loved
people too much — too much for
his own good.

But Gene was the eternal trav-

eller. One day we'd get word’

that he had left town: the next
he'd call from California. His
biggest dream is to release all
‘of his “trapped friends‘ 

The other day he was thinking
about selling all of the stock be-
queathed to him by his father's
estate.

"I know that yuins guys would
would really like to get out of
this’ rat race. Man if I could
I'd sell all that shit and take you
with me out to the Coast. Hey.
we could get it together in a
Volkswagon bus."

BUT that was Gene the Mar-
ine's frustr_ation — to free the
world. He was going about in
the same way that he went about
everythhing —-— with no clear out-
come.

Gene had this Jesus-Christ

theory about himself.

_,__, ’/ _‘

He was convinced that he
would be dead by 28 — maybe
even by his own hand. And that's
where he's heading — on a kind
of self—destruct collision course——
with the law. the on again. off
again fiancee to whom he still
felt a boyhood allegiance and
with his mind.

Gene had a lot of "funny stor-
ies" to tell. “You know that in
the brig out on the coast. we
got so desperate that we used to
shoot up hot water? Five of us
guys would heat up the needle
on the lid of a soup can by
standing underneath it with our
lighters. But we never did speed;
nobody could do speed couped
up in a cell — man that's really
self-destructive."

THEN there was the time that
he burned "some dusgusting
dude" from Shadyside by posing
as a "tough pusher" from Cali-
fornia with red dust all over his
leather jacket and his hair_ in a
decisive tangle. It worked and
the relating-_ was tremendously
funny.

Then there was the time . . . .
ad infinitum.

And that's Gene. Gene the
Marine. Popping in and our of
life. in and out of the cell and
in and out of his head. But he's
beautuful. Simply.Gene the Mar-
ine. honest as hell.

Independence Day--Back To T

which the revolutionaries of to-
day are facing. In‘ 1776, there
was a government that respond-
ed to moneyed interests. Taxes
were high, unjust, and the people
had little say in tlleir government.

In 1970. government still heeds
the voiceof the big money in our‘
country. Taxes get higher every
year. and benefits are fewer. The
will’of the people is the will of
the President. who has a phan-
tom "silent majority” which
agrees with. his policies to the
letter. ‘ ‘

One wonders where this silent
majority lies hidden. when one
looks to\where the silent major-
ity ‘should be found. Theoreti-

cally the silent majority is com-

The chore is a rough one. I am

no such thing as an army, and
the word "war" will be obsolete.

Q.

Athletic Dept. At Fault

To the Editor:

This letter is in reference to
The Pitt News story of July 29.
entitled Pitt Athletics: More
than a Football Team. In the ar-
ticle lack of student support was
cited as a major problem in the
upgrading of all athletics at Pitt.

1 agree that lack of student sup-
port is a problem. Support is more
importantly needed from the Ath-
letic Department. However. the
support given by the Athletic De-
partment is not unlike that given
by a worn-out jock. Allow me to
relate some of my experiences as
a participant of a minor sport
itennisteamt. I

Today I attempted to go swim-
ming at Trees Hall. As I have al-
ways done I took only my swiin-
ming suit and planned to borrow
a towel from the equipment man-
ager. a privilege supposedly
granted to all varsity athletes.

I was informed by the manager
that by directive of A. D. Myslin-
ski only participants in scholar-
ship sports (football. basketball.
wrestling. baseball) were from
now on granted this privilege. If.
as the article states. Mr. Myslin-
ski doesn‘t like to call tennis a
minor sport. perhaps unimportant
would be more appropriate.

Of the four home matches. Mr.
Myslinski found the time to drop
by one of the matches for about
20 minutes.

But these are only minor irrita-
tions. not directly affecting the
quality of the team. What our en-
tire team believes brought about
our 4-10 record. rather than a 10-4
record was the lack of adequate
facilities.

The complete extent of our
training facilities consists of the
seven outdoor courts behind
'l‘ree‘s Hall. Although these are
tine courts for good weather prac-
tice and matches. where do we

practice when the courts are cov— —

ered with waterr. as is the case
for the better part of our March-
.\pril pre—season work‘?

Where do we practice during
the off-season with snow on the
ground‘? Teams we are competing
with train all year long and attract
good high school players due to
fine facilities.

There are no tennis scholar-

ships available at Pitt. no indoor

courts. no ball throwing ma-
chines. no supplied rackets.

Did you ever wonder what you
would do if you were in a tennis
match and your racket broke‘?
My doubles partner found out. He
had to use his sister's girl's rack-
et for several matches until he
could buy a new one. Our team
was almost in shape to start play-
ing good tennis by the time we
played our final match.

We had the calibre of players to
have had a winning season this
year. If we could have trained un-

An “unfortunate, bureaucratic hang-up‘.' prevented Pitt fencer
Sheila Larkin from competing, in the national fencing champion-
ships in New York City last weekend, according to her sponsor, Pro-
fessor John Tyler of the Political Science Department.

The hang-up was money.

Sheila had forwarded’ an initial fee to the tournament offi'cials._

v but she was unaware ofa second

of. her mail atthe Larkin family
home, and before Sheila noticed
the request for additionalfunds,
the deadline had expired. ’ . 4

Tyler" called the ‘disqualifica-

I’m waiting for next year."
