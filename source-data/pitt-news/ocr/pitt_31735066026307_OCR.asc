Russian boy still waiting for intestine transplant

By Linda Wisniewski
For The Pitt News

A Russian boy who suffered irreparable
damage when he was partially disembow-I
eled in an elevator attack in St. Petersburg
is still awaiting intestinal transplant
surgery from Children’s Hospital.

The attack took place on Sept. 30 of last
year in his apartment building where he
lives. with his mother.

Konstantin Kouzmine, 9, was the fourth
victim, and the most seriously wounded,
of a man who has been attacking boys in
St. Petersburg.

“His wounds were very significant,”
said Sue Cardillo, a spokesperson for
Children’s Hospital. “He literally had his

intestines torn out with a hook-like instru-

ment.”
Kouzmine, who lost his entire small

intestine and part of his large intestine in
the attack, is currently discharged on home
care, where he is staying at his father’s
apartment in Wilkinsburg.

The boy’s parents are divorced, and his
father is in Pittsburgh on a visitor’s visa.

Cardillo said Kouzmine was in fair con-
dition when discharged from Children’s
on Nov. 18, 1994.

She said doctors would probably say the
child was in “good” condition, but she dis-
agreed.

“He’s certainly not the average.child
being able to play little league or ride a
bike,” she said.

Cardillo said intestinal transplant
surgery is a relatively new procedure and
has only been performed since 1990. V

“He’s not even on the transplant waiting
list yet,” she said. “We want to make sure
he is healed both physically and emotion-

ally before surgery.”

Cardillo also said it would probably be 3

six months to a year before Kouzmine
would even be considered for a transplant,
and he may have to wait longer than usual

since organ donations are down around the

country.

“Organ donations went down eight per-
cent in our region last year,” said Brian
Broznick, executive director at the Center
for Organ Recovery and Education
(CORE). “Nationwide, donation increased
less than one percent last year.”

Broznick said he does not understand
why anyone should have to wait for
intestinal transplant surgery.

“Quite honestly, these people should be
transplanted overnight,” he said. “We
don’t know why this is happening.”

He said there are currently 25 candidates

PAT to hold meeting

tonight about Spine
Line cmclOak|cm

By Jackie Duggan
For The Pitt News

Port Authority Transit
(PAT) is asking Oakland
residents to participate in
the future of Pittsburgh pub-
lic transportation.

Tonight PAT will hold one
of four public scoping meet-
ings for the Spine Line
transportation project in the
William Pitt Union
Ballroom from 7 to 9 p.m.
The Spine Line project
involves the consideration
of transit improvements in
the North Side to Oakland
corridor. -

The project will look to

extend the Light Rail
Transit “T,” PAT’s
Downtown subway system,
to the North Side and
Oakland. The area affected
will include the North Side,
Downtown, Hill/Midtown
and Oakland — the most
heavily congested corridor
in the region.

“Anyone who lives,
works and goes to school in
Oakland will be affected,”
said Kathleen Miller, an
administrator in the
Department of Parking and
Transportation for Pitt.

The scoping meetings are
part of a federally required
Major Investment
Study/Draft Environmental
Study and are being per-
formed in cooperation with

the Southwestern
Pennsylvania Planning
Commission.

“PAT is very interested in
having public input to the
studies,” said Miller. “Since
it will be funded by federal
money, they must have pub-
lic response.”

Staci Vernick, a

cl

spokesperson for PAT, said
the purpose of the study is
to provide more information
about the project to the
Spine Line communities. ’

According to Vernick,
local residents, business and
civic leaders and others will
have the opportunity to
receive project information
and offer feedback as to
how the proposed alterna-
tives would affect their
neighborhoods.

Representatives of PAT
and contractors Parsons,
Brinckerhoff, Quade and
Douglas, Inc. will be there
to answer questions. They
will also reveal the potential
route alignments and station
locations of the project.

Pitt will have representa-
tives from the departments
of commonwealth relations
and parking and transporta-
tion attending the meeting.

Members of the commu-
nity concerned about envi-
ronmental factors, noise and
construction should attend
the scoping meetings.

“Everyone wants to do
something about the con-
gestion, traffic, [and] air
pollution,” said Miller. “We
are looking at what this line
might contribute on that
basis.”

Vernick said the study is
still in.the gathering infor-
mation stages and PAT is
open to listen to “locally
preferred altematives.”

One alternative to the
extension of the “T” is
expanded bus service.

“From a personal stand
point,” said Miller, “people

_ would be able to talk about

the needs they have and
how this system will, or will
not, benefit them.”

Study notes popular on Pih‘ campus

By George Cann
For The Pitt News

If you are a student who skims through a
required class paperback book to get the most
informative material, you are not alone.

To relieve the stress and anxiety in ﬁnishing a
book, many students use Cliffs Notes and
Monarch Notes as an aid.

In 1958, Cliff Hillegass introduced us to his col-
lections in Lincoln, Neb. His main intentionwas to
provide notes that would supplement reading
materials. ‘

“I believe our Cliffs Notes are used more com-
monly today than in recent years,” said an adver-
tising director spokesperson, who also said that the
notes are intended for the serious student who
wants to learn, but that many students corrupt the
usage of the notes by supplementing them for their
required reading.

The notes present a clear and concise interpreta-
tion of the significance of the paperback books,
and many students utilize information that Cliffs
Notes and Monarch Notes provide.

These critical evaluations have been prepared by
experts who have many years of experience teach-
ing the work or who have special knowledge of
the texts.

“I used the Monarch Notes and Cliffs Notes
when I was in school, until I found out that they
were worthless,” said Jane Flanders, a Pitt faculty
member. “I simply stopped using them because I
was shocked — it did not give the context that l
was expecting.”

Flanders also said that the Cliffs Notes and
Monarch Notes should only be used as an analysis
after the book is read.

There are some individuals who believe Cliffs
Notes and Monarch Notes are not as popular today
as in recent years.

“I had a small amount of contact with the notes
from my brother,” according to teaching assistant
Stan Berard. “They are extremely useful for clari-
fying certain concepts, but many abuse the notes.”

Berard also said the notes should only be used as
a supplement. ,

The University of Pittsburgh Book Center sells

both Cliffs Notes and Monarch Notes.

Margaret Carrado. a buyer at The Book Center,
believes that the notes are helpful only if they are
used as a supplement. ‘ '

“Professors realize that Cliffs Notes and
Monarch Notes are sold here, and seem to ask
questions on examinations that may not be includ-
edin the notes,” said Carrado.

The Book Center’s best sellers are Shakespeare.

Homer’s “Iliad” and other Greek classics. They
are currently selling over 200 a semester. with
most sales occurring at the beginning of the
semester.
. “We sell a variety of Cliffs Notes and Monarch
Notes, but the best seller is the Cliffs Notes,” said
Carrado. Prices at the Book Center range from
$3.75 to $7 for the notes.

The Campus Book Store on Forbes Avenue also
sells Cliffs Notes and Monarch Notes. Their best
sellers are Shakespeare. George Orwell’s “l984”
and the Greek Classics. Notes purchases are heav-
ier during the middle of the semester.

“The students seem to wait until the last minute
and finally come-in and buy them,” said Mike
Chizmar, owner of the Campus Book‘ Store- The

‘prices at the Campus Book Store range from $3.75

to $4.25 for the notes.

The Campus Book Store is also involved in the
Quick Study Course Outline. These outlines are
newly introduced and include laminated covers
that are color coded for a particular field of study.

“These are basic outlines, but I believe they are
laid out in a good manner,” said Chizmar.

_ Chizmar also said the outlines would be more
helpful in science courses than math.

Another interest the Campus Book Store is look-
ing into are Sham’s Outlines. These are paperback
books that involve course notes for the students’

~ USC.

“We hope to get these outlines soon. Many stu-
dents have heard about them, and they are asking
if we stock them,” said Chizmar. These, notes
would be extremely useful for students who are
having a legitimate problem with their course. “I
believe the physics and chemistry outlines would
be more helpful, due to the difficult content [of
those courses],” said Chizmar.

Garland said the criminal gang

Transplant

°From page I
in our area waiting for this type of trans-
plant surgery, but still not enough for a
waiting list.

Broznick said CORE is not only an
educational organization, but also is the
center in our area that evaluates organ
donation candidates, performs lab tests
and also transports the necessary organs
to the surrounding hospitals.

Broznick said Kouzmine, like other
children waiting for this type of surgery,
may end up needing a multi-visceral
transplant instead.

He said a dietary supplement that is
needed to survive. Total Parenteral
Nutrition, or TPN, causes damage to the
liver.

TPN is a high-protein solution that
can be absorbed into the body even
when the intestines are not functioning.
This particular drug was not available in
Russia.

D.L. Clark Candy Co. was a major
donor and helped to make Kouzmine’s
transfer to Pittsburgh possible.

“We donated money for the air trans-
portation. and we also set up a trust
fund for public donations,” said D.L.
Clark Candy Co. spokesman, Jeff

Nobers.

“From my understanding, if the boy
was not brought at least to a European
hospital where they had the proper
antibiotics, he would have died,” said
Nobers. “It was quite an ordeal to get
him here.”

Nobers said they blocked off a quarter
of a plane, flew the boy to New York
City, where he was then flown to
Allegheny County Airport and finally
brought to Children's Hospital by
ambulance.

D.L. Clark Candy Co., which also
owns Pittsburgh Food and Beverage
lnc., decided to help in the situation
after it heard of public pleas on WTAE
radio and in the local papers made by
the boy’s father for help.

“We do a fair amountof business in
Russia.” said Nobers. “We sell a fair
amount of beer and candy there.”

The transplant and hospitalization
alone for Kouzmine will cost approxi-
mately $250,000, and home care will
cost close to $17,000 a month.

Donations are being accepted at PNC
Bank, where an account especially for
Kouzmine has been set up. As of two
months ago, $28,000 had been raised.

°curtai1 access to guns by
Pennsylvania’s youth except
for hunting and recreational

sporting activities. .

The Republicans hold a
slim majority in the state’s
House (102-101) and a
slightly larger one inthe
Senate (29-21).

However, “the fact that the
Republicans have only a
one-seat advantage in the
House might make it diffi-
cult to get some of these
changes through,” said

. Kevin Evanto, the universi-

ty’s assistant director of
commonwealth relations.
Ridge puts curbing crime
in Pennsylvania at the top of
his agenda. In his inaugura-
tion speech on Jan. -17,
Ridge, the state’s 43rd gov-

, ernor, said, “No single factor

imperils the character of our

society — our common-
wealth — as much as
crime.”

Rick Boyd, the director of
Public Safety for the univer-
sity, said that making it
harder for juveniles to obtain
guns is no easy task and can-
not be accomplished in a
short period of time.

“However, in the long run,
it is an attainable goal,” he
said.

Boyd is also in favor of
prosecuting violent juveniles
as adults. “Of course, you
still have to look at each
crime on a case-by-case
basis,” Boyd said, “but I
think that that too is a pru-
dent idea. We’ve had an
absolute explosion of juve-
nile crime in the past few
years. It’s unacceptable to sit
by and do nothing. Society
is entitled to protection from
15- and 16-year-old killers.”

Jodi Leibowitz, the gov-
ernmental relations chairper-
son for Pitt’s' Student
Government Board, said leg-
islation is not the solution
for juvenile crime. She said
she believes the problem can
be solved locally by
“patrolling the Oakland area
better, make the Pitt police
more visible,” even in places
heavily traveled by Pitt stu-
dents.

Ridge is “obviously striv-

‘ ing to crack down on crime,”

said Evanto. “Whether this
legislation will actually

result in a lessening of

crime, we will have to wait
and see.”

said.
Garland, the violence preven-

tion coordinator at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic,

has taken the young people that .

he works with to see movies like
“Menace II Society” and “Boys
N the Hood”.

But adults need to process the
movies and the music with them,
picking out the positive parts and
discussing the message, he said.
Otherwise, the violence may
echo in their minds more than
any other, more valuable, part of
the movie.

Rap music is disrespectful to
women, Garland said. But some-

one has to point that out to young -

people. Garland tells them that
Ice Cube is a chump.

Factors that push young people
to get involved in violence
include failure to establish attach-
ments to values-based organiza-
tions and exposure to violence at
home, Garland said.

“If they come from a family
where dad is beating up on their

mother or [the father’s] girl-
friend, they think that’s cool,” he
said.

But to help young people, we
all must challenge our stereo-
types, he said. Walking by a
group of black young people,
many tend to portray fear. When
Garland walks by a car, the
familiar sound of doors locking
doesn’t surprise him. And
nobody ever stops to give him
directions.

“Are you saying I walk up and
say ‘Hi guys’?” said one woman
in the audience. She said she had
always learned to avoid making

self out of danger.

Think in 3-D

Finding parking in Oakland is often like looking for a good meal
in the dining halls. You are usually left with a vague dissatisfaction
for your troubles.

Parking space in Oakland is scarce, but it doesn’t have to be that
way. There are a number of options open to the area. p

For example, in the fall of 1991, the Syria Mosque was torn
down. For those who have arrived only after the demolition, the
Mosque was located behind the Pittsburgh Athletic Association
building. Now there is a parking lot there, but it is an inefficient use
of space. ' _

Much like other parking in the Oakland area, it is alone level,
paved patch of ground. Instead of covering the ground with painted
asphalt, a parking structure ought to have been erected on the site.

_ When horizontal space is limited, the space above and below
should be utilized. Multi-story parking garages could provide many
more parking places in the area which is now used under one-
dimensional thinking. ’ _

Underground parking garages, like the one at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial, would also help alleviate the parking crunch.

The City of Pittsburgh should work in conjunction with the
University of Pittsburgh to find solutions to the current parking cri-
sis. This would make the university more accessible for commuter
students and those who live on campus, as well as make things easi-
er for visitors to the Oakland 

Remember Auschwitz

Last Friday was the 50th anniversary of the Liberation of the
Auschwitz—Birkenau concentration camp complex by Russian sol-
diers. Up to one-and-a—half million people were slaughtered at the
camp, which was the largest in operation, by the Nazis during
World War II. '

Commemoiations at the camp were marred by controversy, with
some people accusing the Polish government of planning a “nation-
alist” ceremony, according to The New York Times. While it is vital-
ly important to include as many survivors as possible and to show
the true nature of what occurred, it is equally important to make this
camp serve as an example. If the memory of these camps is not kept
alive, then it becomes easier for madmen to repeat the heinous
crimes of generations past.

In the light of increasing_attempts to deny the horrors of the Nazi
regime, the truth must be exposed to the world. The means and
motives of those who were devilishly cruel to their fellow human
beings must be brought to light so that they are never repeated.

With ethnic conﬂicts brewing all over the world and the capacity
of people to destroy one another increasing, the past has. been serv-
ing not as a warning, but as a model for the new madmen who think
they could create a master race.

As we approach the next century and mark these very important
anniversaries, we should pause and reflect on the immense amount
of cruelty practiced on our fellow men in this century. If we are to
truly move forward, we must learn from the past and not repeat it.

 ast week,
' . the uni-
« v e r s i t y

hosted a
C u I t u r a 1
D i v e r s i t y
Seminar in the
student union.
Columnist Also last week,
Erika The Pitt News
Kendra printed a so-
called article by‘Jac,k Daniel
about the inequality of treat-

ment at this university. Since it 7

has been a popular topic lately,
I would like to address this
whole issue of promoting
diversity on campus. ,

Some of you may remember
attending a multicultural diver-
sity seminar during the
required freshman summer

' advising‘ sessions. On the itin-

erary, this little item was
marked with asterisks and the
glaring: word REQUIRED
beside it. Most of us were too
"naive to realize that we would
not be expelled if we chose to
forego the experience, so we
dutifully filed in to begin our
indoctrination.

After this little warm and
fuzzy experience, we began our
careers as students and entered
the indoctrination process in
earnest. Most of us have to take
some form of a writing class,
where the goal is supposedly to
teach us all how to write well.
The real goal, however, is to
continue the indoctrination
process and to teach us that no
politically incorrect opinions
will be tolerated." This same
opinion is also present in many
other courses and functions we
encounter later on. Last week’s
warm and fuzzy session at the
student union provided
“Diversity Facilitators” for
those who felt they were not
indoctrinated enough. George
Orwell would be proud.

There are many problems
with this whole question of
promoting diversity. First, I am
not here to be indoctrinated. I
came to this university for an
education. I (and people who
feel the same way) should have

George Orwell would be proud

the right to an education with-
out having multicultural diver-
sity constantly thrown in our
faces.

Second objection — all of
these programs in the interest
of promoting diversity are
funded with money from my
tuition and student activities
fee. I am personally offended at
the concept of my money
(NOT my parents’ monéy; I am
paying for my. own education)
being used to pay for things
which are so fundamentally
against everything I believe in.

,Since I am sure this could be
misinterpreted, allow me to
explain now why I find this
whole diversity issue so
appalling. ’

Third objection — the inter-
est in promoting diversity is
nothing more than a disguised
attempt at promoting sepa-
ratism. The request for the uni-
versity to build an African
Cultural Center is equivalent to
asking for a white-exclusive
private club. Segregation was
found to be unconstitutional by
the Supreme Court over thirty
years ago. Why strive for its
return? That is exactly what
building a cultural center for
only one group would do.

Mr. Daniel’s article also took
the pains to point out that it
took 51 years to build an
African Heritage Room in the
Cathedral of Learning. Mr.
Daniel, why is it necessary to
point out that fact? The room

. does exist now, so why dwell
on how long it didn’t? What
evidence can-you find to sup-
port your belief that the room
took so long to establish
because of prejudice? I believe
if you check, you may find that
it has more to do with lack of
funding. Also, I notice that you
do not mention that the African
Heritage Room is not the last
room to be built. There are
other cultures not yet represent-
ed, and they are not finding it
necessary to cry foul.

The objection many of us
have to the Africana Studies
Department and others like it is

that we know these depart-
ments are aimed solely at pro-
moting racial hatred. I would
have no problem with an
Africana Studies Department if
the true goal was to educate
people about the history and
cultures of Africa. The goal,
however, is to promote the
belief that equality could not be
achieved, until the evil white
man has been punished for
everything that has happened in
the past. Mr. Daniel questions

‘ why the university offers acad-

emic programs in “Chinese,
French, German  yet, eye-
brows and tempers are raised
when one mentions Africana
...”. Have any of us ever heard
of the French Club refusing to
allow a non-Frenchman into a
meeting? No.

We constantly hear the
demands for equal rights and
equal treatment. If that were
the real goal, I would have no
reason to write this column.
But the real goal is to gain spe-
cial privilegesand treatment in
order to remedy past wrongs.
The word “diversity” in itself is
a direct contradiction to the
idea of equality. In their
attemptsto “gain equality,” the
diversity-pushers are widening

the gaps -between different

American culture groups.

Once all this has been said,
there are several facts to
remember. People are very dif-
ferent, but equality is some-
thing which can and has been
achieved. By trying to “pro-
mote diversity,” certain groups
have been able to deceive their
members into believing that
equality has not yet happened.

Also, history is exactly that. .

We cannot go back and change
what happened over one hun-
dred years ago. We should
learn from history so that it is
not repeated, but we should not
fool ourselves into believing
that history can be changed by
granting special privileges to

g formerly disadvantaged groups.

men’s record
for turnovers
in a season, or
even for consecutive losses to
Georgetown at the USAir.
Arena. It was a women’s record.

But the problem is that no one
cares, and on that note, not
many people were on hand to
witness point guard Carol
Morton breaking Debbie Lewis’
steal record.

The mark, which has stood
since 1982, was 250. Morton
had seven steals in Saturday’s
loss to Seton Hall and has a
total of 252 steals.

The record, which Morton
now owns, will undoubtedly be
pushed further up as the season
wears on. By the end of the
year, it will probably be so high
that it will be difficult for any-
one to conceivably catch her.

And really, no one makes a
big deal about the record. To
Morton and her laid back
demeanor, it’s not really impor-
tant. The success of the team is
her prime concern, as well as it
should be.

However, she should be rec-
ognized and applauded for her
accomplishment. You can imag-
ine the big deal that would be
made if one of the men broke a
record that meant anything.

And despite the loss Saturday,
the women are having a fine

_ season. At 12-6, they are doing

much better than anyone ever
imagined. But just like the
record, no one has made a big
deal, and it seems as if nobody
cares. .

Think of the implications if
the men were to have 12 wins.
The media, fans and God
knows who else would be danc-
ing in the streets. Willard would
be considered a savior and
given a 20-year contract exten-
sion.

But what has head coach Kirk
Bruce received for the success
of his team in what was consid-
ered a rebuilding year? Try a
pat on the back. How about
some fan support? Sure he
deserves it, but it’s doubtful
he’ll get it.

-But it’s not Bruce who really
needs the fans, it’s the team.

LANDOVER, Md. '— It’s like
clockwork: Pitt goes toe-to-toe
for about 34 minutes of the
game, but collapses in the end.

Saturday was no different,
as the Panthers dropped yet
another one they could have

had, this time to the
Georgetown Hoyas 71-60 at
the USAir Arena.

“We always seem to make
that one mistake, usually
around the seven-minute mark
in the second half,” point man
Andre Alridge said. “Even if
we’re up, the other team
always seems to get their
momentum going.”

But this time, Pitt’s downfall
happened at the 2:43 mark
when Hoya big-man Othella
Harrington hit a baseline tum-
around jumper with no time
remaining on the shot clock,
giving Georgetown a 60-56
lead.

“That was the biggest play
of the game,” Pitt coach Ralph
Willard said. “From that point
on they were in the driver’s
seat.”

After Harrington’s shot,
Georgetown went on an 11-4
run to end the game, and Pitt’s
four points were inconsequen-
tial, coming in the final minute
of play.

The Panthers dropped to 5-

and Georgetown raised its
record to 14-3.

“We got some good looks at
the basket in the last 3:00; we
just couldn’t knock them
down,” Willard said.

Pitt opened the game lethar-
gically, and after an Allen
Iverson steal and hoop the
Panthers were down 22-13
with 9:29 left in the ﬁrst half.
But Pitt answered with four
Chris Gant points, an Alridge

 

three-pointer and a Jaime
Peterson put-back to tie the
game at 22.

In the half’s closing sec-
onds, Alridge drove, drawing
two Georgetown defenders
and dished it to Peterson for a
two-handed slam, giving the
Panthers a 36-33 lead going
into the half.

Peterson, last week’s Big
East Player of the Week, gave
an encore performance with
game-highs of 21 points and
16 boards while playing all 40.
minutes again.

“Peterson has been playing
great,” Hoya head coach John
Thompson said. “The kid has
been doing a hell of a job. I
said it before we played him,
and he did it again today.”

The second half didn’t go as
smoothly as the first session.
Pitt only converted seven sec-
ond-half field goals.

Looking to build off of its
three-point lead, Pitt opened
the half with a 35-second vio-
lation. Hoya forward quickly
took advantage of the
Panthers’ gaffe, as Jerome
Williams, who finished with
17 points and 15 boards, con-
verted a three-point play to tie
the game at 36. :

Most of Pitt’s ineptness at
scoring was attributable to
poor shooting —— from every-
where.

Poor shooting leads to Lady Panthers’ loss

By Michael Kovak
Staff Writer _

The largest crowd for a
women’s basketball game in
quite some time left Fitzgerald
Field House disappointed
Saturday as the Lady Panthers
fell to Big East rival Seton Hall
58-5.3.

Team defense was the theme-

of the game, as Pitt shot only 35
percent for the game while

. Seton Hall shot 39 percent. Both

teams committed 20 turnovers.
The loss drops the Lady

record to 12-
6 and 6-4 in
the Big East.
The Lady
Pirates are
now 16-4
with a 7-3 conference record.

Starting Panther center
Melissa Thompson left the
game with a knee injury 1:09
into the game. She did not
return.

“Melissa’s been playing fan-
tastic. She got injured yesterday,
but the trainers said she could
play,” head coach Kirk Bruce
said. “It was tough to overcome
that.”

Even without Thompson and
reserve forward Julie Fomadel
playing, Pitt held a 28-26 advan-
tage at the half. _

The ﬁrst half was a back-and-
forth affair with no team enjoy-

Point guard Carol Morton broke Pit

ing more than a seven-point
lead. That lead belonged to Pitt
late in the half when co-captain
Jenine Joyce nailed the only Pitt
three-pointer of the game, giv-
ing Pitt a 28-21 margin.

Junior forward’ Tressa
Bolfert’s play sparked Pitt in the
first half, leading all scorers with

10 points. Joyce pumped in -

eight.

“I was definitely happy with
my play in the first half,” Bolfert
said. “I did what I had to do.”

The second half continued the
trend of play that began in the
first — turnovers and poor

shooting. The Lady Panthers .

shot only 28 percent in the sec
0nd half. '

“Seton Hall played tough
defense,” Bruce said, “but we
didn’t make the shots.”

Eight minutes into the second
half, both teams were tied at 37-
37. With four minutes to play,
Seton Hall led by one, 49-48.
That’s when Seton Hall forward
Dana Wynne took over the
game.

Wynne dominated the inside
and finished the game with
game-highs of 21 points and 16
rebounds. _ A

“We did a good job of boxing
out. She [Wynne] just found a
way to get the ball inside,”
Bolfert said.

Late in the second half, three
straight Panther turnovers
opened up a 54-48 lead for
Seton Hall. The game then
turned to foul shots.

Joyce stepped to the line for a
one-and-one with 1:59 left. She
missed the first shot, and the
Lady Pirates grabbed the
rebound.

Seton Hall missed its foul
shots and Pitt point guard Carol
Morton collected the board,
dribbled the length of the court
and was fouled attempting a
three-pointer.

Morton drained all three shots
and narrowed Seton Hall’s lead
to 56-53 with 28 seconds

Walk-on Spruill contributesto Panthers‘ skimpy bencli

By Matt Groﬂ'
Senior Stajf Writer

LANDOVER, Md. —The
Georgetown Hoyas knew to
watch out for Pitt’s three—point
game. They knew they would
have to press Pitt to force
turnovers and prevent the
Panthers from gaining any
momentum.

The results from this prepara-
tion were clear: Pitt turned the
ball over 23 times and only made
3 of 12 three—pointers en route to
their eighth Big East loss.

But one dimension of Pitt’s
game which Georgetown could

not have been prepared for was
the entrance of walk-on Mahdi
Spruill in the first half. Spruill,
who has spent most of his Pitt
basketball career in pick-up
games and has not yet played in a
Big East game for Pitt, stepped
onto the ﬂoor at the USAir Arena
six minutes into Saturday’s game
to help guard one of the.nation’s

quickest and highest—scoring V

point guards.

“[Spruill] was frustrating and
quick enough to pick a few balls
from me,” Georgetown point
guard Allen Iverson said. “Pitt
was trapping me all day, and
[Spruill and Andre Alridge]

always seemed to be coming at
me. I know I didn’t play well at
all today.”

Iverson, a freshman, is the
Hoyas’ leading scorer, averaging
19.1 per game, but was held to
ﬁve before Spruill fouled out with
almost nine minutes left in the
game.

Spruill left the game with 11
rebounds and four steals in only
16 minutes of playing time, while
chipping in five points.

“This was his first real game in
college, and he did an excellent
job,” Pitt head coach Ralph
Willard said. “At this point, he_’s
in there to grab rebounds, and he

did that well. He doesn’t quite
have the experience to make a big
contribution offensively at this
level yet, but he’s improving.”

Once in Saturday’s game,
Spruill didn’t hesitate to make his
presence known. After partially
blocking a Georgetown layup,
Spruill took a three-pointer from
the comer on Pitt’s next posses-
sion, which rattled around the
hoop and popped out.

“I wasn’t nervous, but probably
a little excited. I already played
against a lot of these guys, so the
fact that Georgetown was the first
team I played against didn’t both-
er me,” said Spruill, who is

Washington, D.C. native. Spruill,
who played at Woodrow VV1lson
High School, said he played play-
ground ball with Georgetown
stars like Don Reid and remains
close friends with Irvin Church,
the Hoyas’ veteran guard.

Spruill, a 6-foot—4-inch forward
who was out at the beginning of
the season due to a stress facture
in his foot, had not been able to
play until last week because of
reaggravation to the injury.

‘‘I was expecting to hustle and
do my best,” Spruill said.“I know
my job is to crash those boards

and play tough defense. Today, I

The Panthers, who shot 42
percent in the first half, shot a
skimpy 23 percent in the latter
half. Pitt also went 3-for-17
from beyond the arc and shot
54 percent from the free throw
line for the game.

“We shot worse than we ever
did from the free throw line,”
said forward Chris Gant, who
finished with 11 points.
“That’s usually a plus for us.”

Free throw shooting defi-
nitely played a huge role in the
game. Down the stretch
Georgetown doubled (14 to 7)
Pitt’s trips to the charity stripe.
The Hoyas converted 82 per-
cent of them.

The referees were also a key
element in the game. They
allowed Georgetown to play
its usual smash-mouth style
while whistling every Panther
infraction. Consequently, Gant
fouled out with 9:49 left and
walk-on Mahdi Spruill, who
snagged 11 boards, followed
him a minute later.

Willard wouldn’t comment
about the refs, but Alridge did.

“We weren’t getting any

calls,” he said. “And they were
calling every little slap-foul on
us.”
With the Hoyas making 11
more trips to the line, star
freshman Iverson, who scored
only 11 points, sunk six
straight foul shots with under
2:00 remaining.

Pitt threw a variety of traps
to stifle Iverson, who was
averaging 19.5 points a game.

“I studied his game,”
Alridge said of Iverson’s off-
game. “I tried to cut off his left
and make him go right, and
tried to make him turn it over.”

Iverson had eight of
Georgetown’s 21 turnovers.
Pitt had 23 miscues, 12 less
than the Big East record 35
they had in their first meeting
with Georgetown.

“We work hard in practice
and work hard in the games, it
just slips away from us,” Gant

said. “It’s real frustrating.”

game, but a three—pointer by
shooting guard Erin Miller
missed everything, and with it
.went the Lady Panthers’
chances.

Bruce said the main difference
in the game was not the missed
foul shots near the end of the
game, but the three-point shoot-
ing. Pitt only hit 1-13 three-
pointers during the game.

“I liked the shot selection on
the three-pointers,” Bruce
said.“Nobody was hitting them
today.” .

Joyce led a trio of Panthers in
double ﬁgures scoring 15 points.

Bolfert scored 12 points and
collected eight rebounds, while
Morton scored 11 points but
turned the ball over 11 times.
Freshman Latia Howard led Pitt
with nine rebounds.

During the game Morton
became the all—time leader in
steals for the Lady Panthers.

Her seven steals helped her to
surpass the previous mark of 250
steals by Debbie Lewis. Morton

now has 252 steals.

just wanted to come out and
make a contribution to a Pit: vic-
tory.”

Spruill’s contributions came
mostly on the offensive boards,
where he displayed his athleti-
cism and frustrated the Hoya
defense by swiping rebounds
against the likes of 6-8 Don Reid,
6-9 Jerome Williams and 6-9
Othella Harrington.

However, his game situation
inexperience was evident as
Spruill got a bit sloppy with his
passes and missed several free
throws in the first half, but he ﬁt
in the Pitt scheme smoothly in the .

second half until fouling outwith

8:45 remaining. .

“There’s no question; I was
making some mental mistakes out
there,” Spruill said. “But some of
those [foul] calls could’ve gone
either way.”

Spruill, who says his foot is
feeling “pretty good,” said he is
looking forward to helping Pitt
get some wins as they move into
the second half of their Big East
conference schedule.

“I just thank God for this
opportunity to play college bas-
ketball. I hope to continue to

. make a contribution,” Spruill

said. “Right now, we just have to
worry about getting over this los-
ing hump and start winning some
games.”

the value of a packed arena.
Crowd support can make quite a
difference.

With 12 wins so far, the Lady
Panthers have a shot to make a
post—season tournament, some— '
thing that the men can only
dream about.

So if you get the chance,
check out a game. You really can
make a difference.

If the students can rally around
one of the few winning teams
we have at this university, they
may get something that will
make us all proud, a trip to the
NCAA Tournament.
