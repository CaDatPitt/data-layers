‘ the Chinese government’s negative

Wife ﬁghts for husband jailed in China

MIKE MASLANIK
' Staff Writer

Against a backdrop reading “Falun Dafa:
Truthfulness, Compassion, ..Forbearance,” a
woman described the imprisonment of her
fiance. Others meditated while she talked,
unfazed by the light rain. Passersby were
encouraged to sign a petition for his
release. . "

, The woman, Yeong-ching Foo,‘
is a practitioner of the Chinese med-
itation technique Falun Gong, also
called Falun Dafa. She and other
practitioners demonstrated in front
of the William Pitt Union
Wednesday to spread awareness of

attitude toward the technique and to
drum up support for the release of
her fiance, Dr. Charles Lee, a U.S.
citizen currently imprisoned in
China. '

Lee, a Menlo, Ca. native, was V
arrested in China about six months ago at
Guangzhou Airport, where he traveled to “reveal
the truth of the persecution of Falun Gong prac-
titioners,” Foo said. _ "

“The anti-Falun Gong propaganda has creat-
ed a hatred in many Chinese people against
Falun Gong,” she added.

Falun Gong, like Tai Chi, has its roots in tra-

«ditional Chinese meditation. It emerged as a

prominent practice in 1992, when founder ‘Li
Hongzhi introduced Falun Gong to the public.
Falun Gong itself consists of five basic posi-
tions designed to cleanse the mind, body and
soul. Its three chief tenets are truthfulness, com-
passion and tolerance. ,
“If society practices compassion and peace-

  

fulness, the society will get better and better,”
said Xiao Yan.Liu, Falun Gong practitioner and
cancer researcher at Pitt’s Cancer Institute.

.The Chinese government’s active opposition
to Falun Gong began in 1999, when a Chinese
survey found that about 70 million people prac-
ticed Falun Gong — 10 million more people than
were members of the Communist party at that

Practitioners of Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, handed out literature and
performed their mediative movements in from of the William Pitt Union Wednesday.

time. In June of that year, then—Chinese
President Jiang Zemin outlawed Falun Gong and

"established the “6l0 Office,” a secret police

force designed to root out practitioners.
“Zemin was like Hitler, and the 610 Office is
like the Gestapo,” Foo said.
Foo detailed Lee’s treatment at the hands of
Chinese authorities, which she found out about
from the few letters the Chinese
government allowed to be released.
“The police deprived him from
sleep for three days and three nights
and took turns attacking him in
interrogation, and handcuffed him
"for 72 hours,” she said. “The hand-
cuffs cut deep into‘ his skin and the
scars were still visible for months.”
To date, 775,-Falun Gong practi-
tioners have died ‘in government
custody_, according to the group
gathered in front of the Union.
Stateside, the U.S. Congress
passed resolution _188 in July, which
strongly condemns the actions of
the Chinese "government and demands that the
Chinese do not arrest any Falun Gong practition-
ers because of their involvementwith the prac-

 

tice. In Pennsylvania, state Sen. Vincent Hughes, ,

requires the U.S. government to investigate

is harassing Falun Gong practition-
ers in the United States.

her fiance is being imprisoned and

remain upbeat.

“I’m proud of him,” she said.
“His actions are very noble.”

She also said that she under-

stands the trouble she is going

pared to what he is going through.

The demonstration at Pitt is just

will end in Boston. Foo’s goal
throughout it all is to educate peo-
ple about the persecution she feels
fellow practitioners face in China
and, in the process, get her fiance

on principles to determine aid

“When colleges do look at [the
value of the home], it’s a measure of
 the savings a family has,” Hoxby
said. “It is a form of wealth.”

4‘ But “some people feel that [their
home]  is not the same as having
cash in the bank,” and should not be
treated as such, Hoxby said. In
order to use their homes to pay for
college costs, families would either
have to sell them or take out a sec-
ond mortgage.

“People don’t feel comfortable
taking out a second mortgage,”
though, because it is essentially
another loan to pay off, Hoxby said.

To address this issue, a group of
28 colleges, known as the 568
Presidents’ Working Group, has
decided to cap the amount of home
equity they would use in determin-
ing a student’s financial need.

Named after Section 568 of the
Improving America’s Schools Act,
the 28 colleges, which include Yale
and Columbia universities and the
University of Pennsylvania, dis-

cussed and agreed upon common

principles in "determining the finan-
cial need of students.

Families will still be expected to
contribute as much as 5 percent of
their home equity toward education
costs, but now the colleges will cap
home equity at 2.4 times the amount
of the parents’ annual incomes.

Home equity is determined by
subtracting what is still owed on the
house from its current market value.

For example, if a student’s par-
ents mafke $60,000 a year and own a
home worth $350,000, but owe
$50,000 ,.on it, their home equity is

._ $3 09.009,  I1ii,s _..h9.rne eq.1.1i..I§>' » would

thenbe capped at 2.4 times their
income of $60,000, or $144,000.
So, with“fthis new policy, the
family’s ’ expected contribution
wouldbe less. . . A
iWhile the policy would not
affect families with homes less than
2.4 times their income orfamilies
whose annual income,  __itself,_is

have to ask about the home value in
a Financial Aid Supplemental Form
designed by the school. The FAFSA
only asks about the value of real
estate other than the primaryhome.

“We do not stray from the
FAFSA,” said Rusert. “We’ve made
a conscious decision to use the gov-
ernment formula, which does not
include home equity.”

At CMU, 62 percent of incom-
ing freshmen for this year received
an average of $23,000 in financial
aid. The average total cost of atten-
dance at CMU is $39,900 ayear.

According to Rusert, CMU’si‘

student population includes people
from all over the country. By taking

' home equity intoaccount, it “could

negatively impact any students
where there’s a high cost of living,”
he said. 

. Large populations of CMU’s
students come from the New York or
Washington,‘ D.C., metro area,
where the cost of living is extreme-
ly high, he added,

“I’m glad that we don’t consider
[home equity] at Carnegie Mellon

 because I think. it makes us more
attractive to students,” Rusert said.
By not taking home equity into
account, and by still offering merit
awards, CMU can “compete with
Ivy League schools that don’t offer
scholarships,”'—he said.

Suzanne Mccolloch, Pitt’s
senior associate director for
Admissions and Financial Aid,
could not be reached for comment
concerning Pitt’s policies.
Mccolloch said she would be avail-
able for an interview last Friday, but
did not answer or return calls that
afternoon and has not since.

Pitt’s 2003-2004 Financial Aid
Application Supplement asks about
the purchase price, current market
value, and mortgage‘ amount of the
primary home. lit 1

Rusert said CMU is the excep-
tion, since many colleges do take
home equity into account when
determining financial need.

“Universities are looking to
save money,” he said, and they can
do this by looking at a family’s

home equity, because it decreases

the amount of financial aid award-
ed.

Repeat drunk drivers may have Breathalyzers installed in their cars

BAC, page 1

tives, such as state Sen. Connie
Williams, D-Montgomery and
Delaware, want to send the message
that the law will no longer be
lenient.

“A drunk driver kills someone
every .33 minutes,” Williams said in
a press release. “It is time we send
drunk drivers the message that this is
not acceptable.”

“I feel that people aren’t going
to stop drinking and driving, no mat-
ter what,” said Veronica Williams, a

Pitt junior. “Not only should they

lower the limit, but they should
increase the penalties, as well,
because a lot of people are repeat
offenders. They need to take away
the driving privileges of those who
continue to drink and drive.” _

Sen. Williams agrees. She has

been pushing for stiffer punishments “

for years now and has sponsored
Senate Bill 467, which would raise
the consequences of a second
offense from a second to a first-
degree misdemeanor, and third and
subsequent offenses would be con-
sidered third-degree felonies.

In addition to the increase in

penalties,'Williams is lobbying for
an ignition interlock device that
would be installed in the cars of
repeat offenders for one year. The

offenders would have to breathevinto

the device before starting their cars
and periodically while they are dri-
ving. If their BAC were above
0.025,‘ the device would shut down
the engine.

According to the state’s
Interlock Device Act of 2000, repeat
offenders should have already been
required to have one installed into
their cars. However, some county
courts ruled the Act unconstitution-
al, stating that only if a judge specif-
ically orders one to be installed do
offenders have to have them put into
any of their cars. ~ s

...n¢u.:\a’.‘.'

The current proposals, though,
would make having a device
installed‘ part of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation's con-
ditions for driving privilege restora-
tion, avoiding leaving the decision
to the courts. -

“I believe we do not sufficiently

punish repeat offenders,” said
Williams. “Currently, all repeat
offenses are considered misde-

meanor offenses.” -

According to data collected by
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, 2.1
million college students drove under
the inﬂuence of alcohol last year,

and 41 percent of all traffic fatalities
in Pennsylvania were alcohol-relat-

ed. A study done by the US...

Department of Health and Human
Services analyzed 15 states with
0.08—blood-alcohol laws and found
that lowering the limit caused an
eight percent reduction in alcohol-
related traffic deaths.

As of July 2003,-42 states,
Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico
had all lowered their blood-alcohol
limits. Pennsylvania is among the
last states to do the same.

The state Senate and House of
Representatives have both passed

bills concerning the issue of repeat
offenders, but they have not agreed
on all points. Once an agreement is
reached, the bill may be signed by
the governor and put into effect.

And if that does happen, stu-
dents, though doubtful, hope it
works.

“I don’t know that it’s going to
stop people from drinking and dri-
ving,” Veronica Williams said of the
legislation. “But I think it’s a good
start, because people are dying, and
it’s never_the ones who are drunk.
It’s always the innocent who are the
victims.”

Yet another personal responsibility lawsuit

Among recent, outrageous
attempts to legislate away personal
responsibility, the mother of a South
Side Middle School student blows
many of the rest out of the water.

The student, a 13-year-old girl,
was suspended in May — along with
her partner in crime, a teenage boy ——
after classmates informed school
authorities that the two had engaged
in oral sex on a school bus during a
field trip.

The students admitted to the con-
sensualact and are suspended until
Oct. 29. They are permitted to attend
the district’s alternative education
program in the meantime. '

They did the deed, they admitted
to it, and punishment was meted out
accordingly. - ‘

The story ought to end there. The
girl’s mother, however, decided to
claim — in court — that her daugh-

ter’s constitutional rights had been-

violated by the suspension, and that
the school district’s policy on sex acts

7 on the bus was unclear.

Thankfully, Beaver County Judge
George E. James threw out the Aug.
29 appeal.’

Unfortunately, an embarrassing
situation has been turned into a deba-
cle, a social nightmare and a failure in
parenting for the girl. ‘

While her name is not in the
press, her peers -— the very people,

especially at middle school age,
whose ridicule she likely fears the
most -— know who she is. As if being
known for making bus rides more
exciting won’t be bad enough, she
now has the added burden of lawsuit-
scorn to bear.

Which isn’t to say the youngsters,

themselves, didn’t make a heinous ”

error of judgment. They did, and they
were sanctioned appropriately. The
school stepped in and corrected
socially unacceptable behavior.

The mother, though, has gone out
of her way, not only to further embar-
rass her daughter, but alsoto sabotage
any possible good that could come
out of such an unfortunate incident.

' The girl is learning, from her
mother, that there is no need to take
responsibility for her ‘actions. If she
does something wrong and gets
caught, she’s now learning, she
should simply complain to higher and
higher echelons of authority.

The mother, while clearly "grasp-
ing at semantic straws, is also teach-
ing the girl that anything not express-
ly forbidden is fair game.

Thereare no signs in most ofﬁces
forbidding the removal of one’s pants
and dancing the polka on the confer-
ence-room table.

If everyone followed this
woman’s logic, corporate meetings
would get a lot more interesting.

Catholic Nenian club offers faith, fun

NEWSMAKER
Philip Magcalas

Editor’s note: The following is in
response to an e-mail sent to student
group leaders asking for apiece on their

group.

Heard any good Catholic jokes late-
ly? . A
Chances are, you have. It’s become

.-a sort of cultural fad T to belittle

Catholicism lately, but Catholics on
Pitt’s campus have a fantastic opportu-
nity to explore and, yes, celebrate their
religion in the Pitt Newman Club. The
Newman Club has frequent functions,
rangingfrom service projects to Bible
studies and social outings.

They also have a‘ choir that practices
on Thursday evenings at 7:30 and per-
forms at the 10:00 a.m. Heinz Chapel
mass on Sundays. The crowd that
attends Newman Club events is a
diverse slice of the Pitt community; We

count engineers and music students,

born Catholics, recent converts and non-
Catholics alike among our members.
Anyone is indeed welcome to explore
different aspects of the Christian’
lifestyle. ' V '
One example of an outing is the
trips we occasionally make to the
Ravens project, a farm run by a priest,
which raises vegetables and the like for
people who'can’t otherwise afford'them.
It’s really one of the ways the Newman
Club exercises the Christian ideal of
charity to others..We’ve been known to
work at soup kitchens, adopt a family
during each holiday season, and we also
have service project “altemative” spring
breaks. This is, of course, in addition to
the joint trip with Carnegie Mellon
University members to Rome for stu-
dents who would like to go, which we
are planning for this upcoming spring
break. We have speakers and presenters,

V like local sportscaster John Fedko.

The social events range from the
more religious — like Bible studies;
Holy Thursday visits to seven interest-
ing local churches and cathedrals, and,
of course, masses — to the more secular
+ such as dinners the first Friday of
every month, annual dances, and ice
skating. Regardless of the event, there is
always a fantastic air of camaraderie
and certainly no lack of interesting dis-
cussion, and even debates on religious
themes. , ,,

A An organization -that furthers the aid

of others in need and the search for’

identity in the company of God is the
perfect complement to the college
lifestyle. And there’s really no shame in
finding spiritual identity as a Catholic.
Really, it’s quite refreshing to see the
archaic stereotype of a rigid and unfor-
giving Catholicism, which tolerates
naught but prayer, contested by the mere

presence of a group of sociable college.

students and priests playing volleyball
or exploring the sights of Washington,
D.C., all of whom have a realistic per-
ception of what it means to be Catholic
today.

I suppose this is really my personal
invitation, as president, to come and
explore the ideas of the Newman Club,
a group as diverse as the University of
Pittsburgh community itself. Engage in
conversation with me or any other
Newman Clubber; help us out with
feeding the homeless or come have din-
ner with a bunch of people interested in
incorporating the ideals of Christ into
their lives.

And if you really want to hear a
good Catholic joke, no one tells one like
a priest.

Off The Wire: Don’t buy the hype on Showtime’,s Bush movie

By Jeff Postelwait
Daily O’C0llegian (Oklahoma State U.)

(U-WIRE) STILLWATER, Okla. — It’s so hard to tell
what is actually happening from what has been careful-
ly staged, scripted and supervised. The lines between
reality and photo opportunity are so blurred sometimes
that it feels like we’re living in a movie.

Our action-ﬁgure president now has an action ﬁgure
all his own. The little plastic man wears a United States
Air Force ﬂight suit, much like the one that the “real”
president wore on the deck of an aircraft carrier when he
announced that the Iraq war was ofﬁcially over, but
before 144 more soldiers died between then and now.

The G.I. Joe—style doll comes complete with fully
poseable limbs — his Texas Air National Guard service
record from 1972 to 1973 is not included, naturally.

The Showtime Network is taking this problem to"

new lows. They’re going to air a docudrama called “DC
9/11: Time of Crisis” which features the actions of the
White House during the Sept. 11 attacks. The ﬁlm is set
to run on Sept. 7, which will kick off President George
W. Bush’s re—election campaign a little bit early.

Now, if you’ve got a memory that can take you back
further than last week, you probably don’t remember
hearing a whole lot from the White House at all on that
fateful day. Vice President Dick Cheney had been
whisked away to an undisclosed location,r as per his
M.O., and Bush was aboard Air Force One, far from the
public eye when they needed him the most.

But that hasn’t stopped Showtime from portraying

the still-in-office commander in chief — played by.

Timothy Bottoms of “The Last Picture Show” — as a
selﬂess, dynamic and otherwise strong character.
Interestingly enough, Bottoms also played a more

farcical version of Bush on Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s
“That’s My Bush!” The show skewered the‘ president
mercilessly before being cancelled just weeks before the
real Sept. 11.

As if transforming the tragic happenings of Sept. 11
into a made-for—TV movie wasn’t shameless enough, the
plot of “DC 9/ 11” is about as sexed—up as the evidence
that the Bush administration used to pacify the American
public just enough to allow the invasion and occupation‘
of Iraq. ‘ O

In it, Showtime ﬁlmmakers hearken back to the
days of Stalin-era propaganda ‘pieces, where still—living
leaders were re-imagined as heroes of the common man
who faced tragedy with bravery and staunch determina-
tion.

We see, in the movie,,many revisions of pieces of
history that are truly hard to forget. One such moment
was when Andrew Card informed Bush of the attacks
while he was reading to a class of elementary school
children. The fake Bush immediately left the room to
find out more about the disaster in progress. The real
George Bush picked up a copy of “The Pet Goat” and
continued reading for 29 minutes only to later lie that he
had seen the whole thing unfold on live television.

He later told an audience in Florida that, when he
saw the events on television, his ﬁrst impression was
that the pilot had made a mistake, but later realized that
this had been an act of terror. But we remember what
really happened. ‘

While watching “DC 9/l1,” it’s important to keep
what really happened in your mind at all times. One of
Bush’s more memorable lines from Sept. 13 was “I’m
not going to let some tinhorn terrorist keep the president
of the United States away from the nation’s capital.” The
quote was spiced up by Showtime to read, “If some tin-

hom terrorist wants me, tell him to come and get me! I’ll
be at home, waiting for the bastard!”
More inspiring? Maybe. But -not true.

— This film wasn’t just made by a fan of Bush’s, either.
The writer and producer, Lionel Chetwynd, worked for
the Reagan administration like so many others from
Bush’s administration. He is currently part of the
President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.‘

So this film that masquerades as an unbiased
retelling of the facts, comes, for all intents and purposes,
directly from the mouth of the White House.

Chetwynd consulted many administration ofﬁcials
while working on his script —— even Bush himself. You’d
think Bush’s own modesty would prevent him from

A allowing the project to continue, but you thought wrong.

He also consulted a multitude of conservative pundits,
namely Fred Barnes, Charles Krautharnrner and Morton
Kondracke. » -

Chetwynd claims, “I don’t think it’s possible to do a
revision of this particular bit of history. Every scholar
who has looked at this has come to tire same place that
this ﬁlm does.”

That’s none too reassuring when you look at his .

sources and his history.
Don’t buy the hype.
The president is not a selﬂess defender of truth, jus-

tice and the American way. George W. Bush is just a U

man. He makes mistakes. He’s not Churchill. He’s not
Superman. —

He’s just your average, oil~tycoon, frat boy who
went AWOL from the military during Vietnam, only to
be appointed president by the Supreme Court, the
Florida Selection Board and his brother, Jeb.

This is quite a stunt for an administration that so
often accuses others of revising history to pull.

 

Dignitaries still should tip

As a waitress at a popular
restaurant in Oakland, I have wait-
ed on many high-level University
figures. I have since ceased to be
eager to do so, having found that
being a public figure is not neces-
sarily synonymous with generosity,
nor even decency, where tips are
concerned.

This has come as quite a sur-
prise to me. These are men and
women who move in high circles. It
is probable that they are familiar
with the conventional — and even
the more obscure — social graces.

One such social grace is the
standard 15 percent tip to which
waiters and waitresses are accus-
tomed. This tip is meant to supple-
ment our hourly wages, which are
significantly less than minimum
wage. When I, having done no per-
ceivable wrong to a table of Pitt
“dignitaries,” receive less than this
15 percent, I feel slighted both as a
student and as a human being.

Of course, as a human being, I

merely suffer from the typical ser-
vice industry, automated-food-and-
beverage-delivery-system complex.
As a student — and to be a young
waitress in Oakland is to almost
necessarily be a student —- I feel
that some interest in my well—being
is due to me by the figureheads of
my academic institution. My fellow
servers and I are often the names
that will be heralded as the token
Marshall Scholars, or Mellon
Fellows, or whatever other acco-
lades Pitt cites to add to its “Public
Ivy League” credibility.

When University figureheads
seemingly have no interest in
acknowledging your presence as a
student until you distinguish your-
self and show up on the press—con—
ference radar, or arrive in the grad-
uation herd, it becomes rather diffi-
cult to want to acknowledge their
own presence as figureheads of
your University.

I, for one, will never shake the
hand that tipped me $2 on a $25
check.

An open letter to the “nice girls”

It is Sunday night, and I’ve just
returned from Gullifty’s, where I
enjoyed an enormous chocolate
brownie. Just as any red-blooded
college student would do’, I immedi-
ately check Instant Messenger for

any messages left for me. Next, of’

course, I sift through the endless
garbage e—mails looking for any-
thing relevant to my life.

As I wear out my delete key,
something catches my eye. I stare
and_ stare at this particular e-mail
from a random porn site. The e—mail
has no pictures of naked women
doing unmentionable things.

It consists of one perfectly cen-
tered link. “Girls Back in College
and Drunk Already.” I sit in silence
and wonder why so many guys are
attracted to the typical college party
girl. And, more importantly, do the
“other” girls at school know that
there are guys who respect and

appreciate them?

So I decided to write them all a
letter. _ 

I know you are out there
because I have been lucky enough
to meet a few of you. You are the
girls who I-will never see on a
“Girls Gone Wild” DVD or in The
Pitt News police blotter. You are the
girls who wouldn’t dream of sleep-
ing with me after just meeting at a
party. While you may enjoy the
occasional rum and coke, you have
never been the absurd girl in a

. denim mini-skirt doing a keg stand.

You probably get intensely irritated
every time you overhear a conver-
sation that begins “I was so trashed
last night...” You refuse to be rep-
resented by stereotypes.

For these reasons, and so many
more‘, I wish I could spend an
evening with each and every one of
you. I assure you that guys like me
still exist and we’re looking for
you: '

O.A.R. gets a little help from MTV

BRIAN PALMER
Staff Writer

With the release of their first major—label
album, O.A.R, short for ...of a revolution, have
found themselves in a world that they have not
known but have been working toward ever since
forming seven years ago.

After their signing with Lava Records,
O.A.R. is now on the radio as well as on MTV.
And with the exception of their notoriety in their
hometown in Maryland and in Columbus, Ohio,
where they went to school, they haven’t experi-
enced coverage quite like

this. .dent label to actually‘
O.A.R. formed in . - break through.” ~

1996, when Marc O.A.R. plays what

Roberge, vocals and they like to call,

guitar, started to play 0
music with Chris

“Marc and I grew

up together,” Culos
said, “We have been
best friends since

kindergarten, and even
before that, our parents
were friends with each
other.”

Along with Benj
Gershman on. bass and
Richard On playing
electric guitar, the four
members went off to
Ohio State University,
where they met Jerry
DePizzo, who plays the
saxophone.

“We were friends first and foremost. There’s
a bond between us. It’s like a family,” Culos said.

The first single from their new album, In
Between Now and Then, isn’t your typical first
single from a new album —— because it isn’t a new
song. “Hey Girl” has been recorded on almost all
of their previous albums — thus there are multi-
ple versions of it.

After recording the songs for Now and Then,
the band sat down to figure out which song would
become the album’s’ first single.

“Our label, Lava, thought of the idea of re-
recording the song ‘Hey Girl,’’’ Chris Culos said,
“Ourfirst instinct was that there was no way we
were re—recording, because not only is it re-
recording, it is re—re—re—recording.”

The final decision to make a refined version
of “Hey Girl” has turned out to be a clever move
by the label and the band. It is now finding its
way into radio stations nationwide and playing in
some pretty big markets.

“It was the one song that got a little bit of air-
play in a major market [prior to In Between Now
and Then] on a radio station. Chicago’s 94.7 [The
Zone] actually started playing us for a couple of
weeks,” Culos said. “And we had really high

request numbers and it did really well there. It
was a proven success and something we could
take to other radio stations and hopefully have
our foot in the door.” A

To those who are anti—major label, signing o
with Lava may seem like selling out. They may
think that bands that have been on independent
labels should remain where they are. But O.A.R.
doesn’t feel that way. _

“It wasa really smart business decision for
us, as a band, to go on to a major label,” Culos
said, “so we would have opportunities to be on
the radio and on television, which is limited for a

band that is on an indepen-

“island-vibe-roots-
rock,” a mix of reggae,
funk, island sounds and

‘Every O.A.R. live show
— is. different from the
last. No song is played
the same way or for the
same amount of time.
On the DVD that comes
packaged with In
Between Now and
Then, there is an 11-
minute version of one
of their most popular
songs, “Crazy Game of
Poker,” that proves this
to anyone who
has seen this song
performed live.

“When we started playing as a band,
our fans were -our age, sophomores and
juniors in college,” Culos said. “Kids in
collegetake CDs home and play them for
their younger brothers and sisters. And
they play them for their‘ older brothers and
sisters, so, in the past few years, it seems
as though the crowd is a few more years
older and a few years younger than our ini—~
tial fan base.” ~-

Besides playing on the Liquid Mix
Tour, which rolls into the Chevrolet  
Amphitheatre on Tuesday, O.A.R. also .
played along with 311 this past summer '
and they have done some shows with
Pittsburgh’s very own The Clarks.

“It was great playing with 311. We got
to play in front of audiences that had never V I
heard us before,” Culos said. “And it was '
cool, because we have a very positive mes-
sage in our music, and so does 311, even
though our music sounds completely dif-
ferent at times.” 1

“Playing with,The Clarks -was a great
time as well, especially in Pittsburgh,”
Culos said. “People in Pittsburgh are fanat-

good old rock ‘n’ roll. _

ics for The Clarks. I remember playing a show in
Green Bay and some other cities where the audi-
ences were new to The Clarks, and them rocking
out for those audiences as well.”

, A lot of bands say they go out and play 110%
every time they go out to play, and, for the price
of ‘a ticket, the fans expect them to do so. But
sometimes the energy, on stage relies on the ener-
gy of the crowd as well. .

“Our shows rely very heavily on the energy
of the crowd,” Culos said. “We go up there every
night and we try to give 110%, but that doesn’t
mean we have to be dancing around the stage and
going crazy to give 110%.” ,‘ _ ' “Z

“If the vibe isa little more mellow, then we
are going to play some .mellow songs,” Culos
said. “And I think that a person can have just as
much of a great experience at a lower energy
show than at a show where there’s 5,000 people
jumping up‘ and down and singing. along to every
word.” ‘ ’ A

- On the bill with O.A.R. is rap—rock ‘group
N .E.R.D. and Philadelphia-grown The Roots,
who also mix rock guitars and drums with hip-
hop beats and lyrics. There are many more bands
scheduled to take one of the two stages set up
under the tent in Station Square, from reggae to
rock and hip—hop and R&B. Tuesday night will be
a night filled with eclectic, great music.

O.A.R. will be performing with N.E.R.D., The

Dark Star Orchestra set to light up the ‘Burgh

It turns out that The Grateful Dead, not
only paved the way for jam bands, but also
built a solid foundation of songs that would
be covered time and time again. There are
oodles of Dead and ‘J enry Garcia cover bands
out there. Dark Star Orchestra sets tl1em—

call a band covering The Dead average -

Rather than merely re-doing Garcia and

 
     
     
     

shows in their entirety. It only makes sense,
because the real magnetism to The Dead
wasn’t their albums, it was their live shows.

DSO is composed of guitarists John
Kadlecik and Rob Eaton, who assume the
roles of Garcia and Bob Weir, respectively;
drummers Rob Koritz and Dino English
who battle it out on separate sets on stage,
Dead style; bassist Kevin Rosen; and Scott

to play the part of The Dead’s Donna

Many hours of dedicated research have
gone into the project, as the band performs

played Concert—goers and avid Dead fans
can do their best to try to ﬁgure out when and
where the show took place, but they won’t

DSO plays the exact encore that The Dead
played at that show before they,c1ue in the

damn good jobtrying. For some Dead fans,
their eyes mist over as they realize that the
show they are witnessing today was the
exact one that they saw some 25 or so years
ago.

Unsung — The Limey:
Buried Soderbergh gem

The Limey

Starring Terence Stamp, Peter
Fonda, Luis Guzman, Leslie
Ann Warren, Barry Newman
Directed by Steven Soderbergh
Released: 1999

No one in the ﬁlm world has experi-

enced the meteoric rise in importance and

artistic clout that Steven Soderbergh has.’

Soderbergh is by no means an
unknown entity. His “Sex, Lies and
Videotape” is an indie classic and his first
collaboration with George Clooney, “Out
of Sight,” allowed him to make the ﬁlms
he has over the past few years — “Traﬂ'1c,”
“Ocean’s Eleven” and ﬁlms he’s pro-
duced, like “Confessions of a Dangerous
Mind” and “Insomnia.” _'

But sandwiched in between “Out of
Sight’? and “Erin Brockovich,”
Soderbergh’s ﬁrst massive success, is
“The Limey,” a short feature ﬁlm starring
Terence Stamp, Leslie Ann Warren, Peter
Fonda and Luis Guzman. The ﬁlm had the
unfortunate fate of being released in the
midst of “Star Wars” prequel madness.
Luckily, though, a few small theaters
made room for it, thus allowing some peo-
ple to see it.

“The Limey” is an 89-minute charac-
ter study/revenge tale of British ex-con
Wilson (Stamp), who comes to California
to seek out slimeball record executive
Terry Valentine (Fonda), the man whom
he thinks is responsible for his daughter’s
death -

Wilson ﬁnds out about the death of
his daughter —- Jenny, who had lived in

Los Angeles — from Eduardo Roel
(Guzman), a shifty but well—intentioned,
loyal guy who contacts Wﬂson during his
latest stint in an English prison. Upon
arriving in California, Wilson , hits
Eduardo up for infomiation about whom
his daughter had been dating and the
speciﬁcs about how she died, and, ulti-
mately, enlists his help in getting revenge
on Valentine.

The story is basic stuff — numerous
revenge ﬁlms have been maderover the
years. “The Limey” differs in that it’s not
a kill-ﬁrst, ask—questions-later ﬁlm. That
would be the easy way to do it. This ﬁlm,
though, never takes the easy way out of a
situation. The ending —— which I would be
wrong to spoil — is a testament to that,
and there is an undercurrent of regret,
something not normally found in revenge
ﬁlms, from every character. It’s the careful
handling ,of the material and characters,
the emotional impact that’s brought out of

them, and Soderbergh’s direction that

makes the ﬁlm a standout.
“The Limey” is W11son’s —— and,
therefore, Stamp’s — ﬁlm. The small,

iquiet, British actor conveys so much

through his eyes and the slight contours of
his aged face that when he speaks, the ho-
hurn dialogue becomes something much
more. i

Take the scene, for example, where
Wilson is talking to Elaine (Warren), an
acting teacher who was close to Jenny.
They talk about his daughter, their broken
relationship and how he was affected
when he learned of her passing. Every line

Dissing Limp Bizkit for the revolution

Above the Noise

The Revolution Smile
Flawless/Geffen Records
~i‘n2r1/2 
Recommended if you like:
Foo Fighters, Fuel, Filter

You are the front man of new
band with a new project that may or
may not take off, and a tentative
record deal is in the works with a
small label. Then a big-name band
asks you to join them. What would
you do? is -

That’s exactly ' what Shaun
Lopez told Limp Bizkit when he
was invited to jamwith the band and
fill the lead..guit’ar opening.

The rejection so intrigued the
backwards-hat-wearing business
mogul who is Fred Durst that he
asked Lopez to send him a demo. He
then signed Lopez’s band — The
Revolution Smile — rounded out by
guitarist Tim McCord, drummer
Jeremy White and bassist Octavio
Gallardo — to Flawless Records.

Don’t jump to conclusions,
though. Just because it’s Durst’s
label doesn’t mean the band is Baby
Bizkit. The label stayed out of the
recording process and let the band
be who they are and do what they
felt needed to be done to make a
successful album — good thing, too,
because the plan worked.

Lopez made the switch from
lead guitarist to front man after his
previous band, the ‘90s rock group

Revenge, cockney style goes undeservedl

The Limey, page 12

of dialogue is a variation on dialogue you’ve heard before
in situations like this in other ﬁlms. But Stamp’s manner,
eyes and delivery of those lines make the scene heart-
breaking and much ‘more powerful than it would have
been in the hands of a lesser actor.

This scene, and Stamp’s performance as a whole, is
complemented, not by another actor, but by Soderbergh’s
direction.

Soderbergh tells the story in a non-linear way. As the
ﬁlm opens, Wilson exits the airport and heads to a hotel.
But at the conclusion, we see a conversation Wilson has
with a woman who shares the ﬂight into LA. It works as
an ending, but, taken on its own —'— as a beginning, as well
—— it is representative of the cyclical nature of the film and

 

its characters. This non-linear editing occurs throughout
the ﬁlm, like in the aforementioned scene between
Wilson and Elaine, and it visually echoes the chaotic cir-
cumstances of Wﬂson being in California.

In addition, Soderbergh uses ﬂashbacks to help tell

the back—story of the characters.iIt’s in-Wilson’s ﬂash- ~

backs, though, where Soderbergh’s contribution to
Stamp’s performance is most evident. Soderbergh takes
moments from one of Stamp’s earlier ﬁlms, 1967’s “Poor
Cow”,_in which he plays a character similar to Wﬂson,
named, appropriately enough, Wilson — screenwriter
Lem Dobbs is quick to point out on the DVD commen-
tary that “The Limey” wasn’t intended as a sequel to
“Poor Cow” — to aid in his visual storytelling. 7

Through these ﬂashbacks we can see, rather than be i

told, how Wﬂson’s life as a'ciiminal hurt his relationship
with his daughter and wife, and just how much he loved

y unseen by masses

both of them. The scenes from “Poor Cow” are washed
out, resembling old, worn home movies, heightening the
solemn regret that Wﬂson the character has and which
Stamp brings to life as an actor.

“The Limey” is, in a way, the prototypical
Soderbergh ﬁlm; the film where he sha1penedfhis“story—
telling, direction and cinematography so that he could
create the ﬁlms he’s making now. .It’s' a shame so few peo-

” ple saw “The Limey” ‘upon itsinitial release, but, thank-

fully, DVD technology makes this modern classic more
accessible than it was in theaters. ’ C

The Pitt wornen’s soccer team kicked,

off its season over the weekend with two
games in Florida. Pitt (1-1) dropped game
one, 3-1, to the Central Florida Golden
Knights on Saturday but then rebounded on

_ Monday tobeat the Jacksonville Dolphins,

which produced the third goal, was the

Avenging losses from last season should erase aftertaste

The wait for Panthers football fans is almost
over. » . - —.

On Saturday, the Panthers will kick
off their season versus Kent State. There

. are high expectations for this season, and,’
even though Pitt manhandled Oregon
State, 38-13 in the Insight Bowl, I’m sure
there are many Panthers who still have a
bad taste in their mouths from the final -
two games of last season. '

The Pitt versus Miami game came
down to the closing seconds, when quar-
terback Rod Rutherford overthrew wide
receiver Yogi Roth in the end zone.

Then there was the West Virginia game. Four
Pitt turnovers resulted in a 24-17 loss in the
Backyard Brawl. The loss killed all hopes of a Bowl
Championship Series berth. ’ .

All four of the Panthers’ losses last season were
heartbreak.ers. Pitt could have easily gone undefeat-
ed last season, with a change of fortune.

Well, it’s a new year, ‘and it is time to avenge
those tough losses. The Panthers’ first opportunity
will be at Texas A&M on‘ Sept. 27. ' .

We all remember the illegal shift calls on th
line. I had not seen a referee call an illegal shift on a
field goal attempt since I’ve been a student at Pitt.
After two illegal shift penalties, kicker J .B.
Gibboney missed wide right from 30 yards out.

 

As a result, the Panthers had to go for the two-

point conversion after its final touchdown in order to

tie the game. The two-point conversion

5: failed, and Panthers’ fans were sent home

 with a disappointing 14-12 Panthers’
loss’. ’

In the Notre Dame game, the
Panthers were down 7-6 when Rutherford
fumbled deep in Panthers’ territory. The
opportunity for revenge against the
Fighting Irish comes on Oct. 11.

The last two opportunities come
against opponents that probably dealt Pitt
its most painful losses last season. West Virginia
hosts the Panthers on Nov. 15 and Miami Visits the
Steel city on Nov. 29. _ I _

These are all huge games that I’m sure are on the

minds of the players and therfans. On Saturday, we
will get our first opportunity to ‘see what the 2003
Panthers are made of. .
A It has been a rough offseason forrthe team, as
they lost sophomore wide receiver Billy Gaines,
who died in a tragic fall over the summer. In most
recent days, their leader on offense has accusations
being thrown at him.

_ How this team responds to the death of a team-
mate and the recent allegations against Rutherford
will set the tone for this season. “Can this team over-
come adversity?” is probably a question that

remains unanswered.

I believe that your first game is a stepping stone
that you build off of. Especially with the schedule
that the Panthers will face. They begin with Kent
State, Ball State and Toledo, then gradually build up,
as Texas A&M and Notre Dame loom in the near
future. I’ ' ~ 

Pitt needs to get out on the field and dominate its
first three opponents and set the tone for the remain-

'der of the season. The Panthers are ranked No. 12 in -

the nation, and they need to show that they deserve
that ranking right off the bat. ’
The Panthers must take care of business against
the weaker opponents and‘ show, up primed and
ready against the powerhouses. The first couple of
months of the season are just a tune up. .
In November, the Panthers face Big East oppo-

nents Virginia Tech, West Virginia and Miami. These

games will play a crucial role in Pitt’s postseason
bid and run at a Big East Conference title.

I think most people agree that the Panthers will
legitimately compete for the Big East title in 2003.
But it starts on Saturday. Pitt cannot afford to wait
and play catch up. It is critical for Pitt to show Kent
State and the rest of the country ‘what Panthers’
Football is all about.

One person’s snowstorm is another person’s treasure

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Ask a few, random yinzers what they
hate most about Pittsburgh winters, and a
majority of them would probably say they
hate the snow. A

It might seem strange to them to think
that someone from sunny California
would actually like Pittsburgh because of
the snow, but that is what Gini Ullery
claims is the biggest difference between
the two places, and‘ she loves it. I

Ullery, a] junior from Tracy, Calif., is ~

an outside hitter for Pitt’s volleyball team
and has been a ‘fixture in the Panthers’
starting lineup since her freshman year.

Last year," despite missing eight
matches, Ullery finished fourth on the
team in kills and ﬁfth in digs.

After last weekend’s action, Ullery is-

leading the Big East in kills per game, and,
on Wednesday, she talked with us about
volleyballand snow.

The Pitt News: When did you ﬁrst decide
to play volleyball?

Gini Ullery: I guess I started back in ele-
mentary school. All the kids were doing it.
[laughs] I went to a small, Catholic school,
so it was kind of the thing to do, to get into
the sports program.

TPN: Were you interested in other sports?

GU: I played basketball for many years —
soccer —I guess that’s about it.

TPN: What made you want to stick with '

Volleyball?

GU:- I love volleyball. It’s an awesome
spo1t,Vboth mentally and physically.

TPN: What is your favorite part of the
game?

say defense [too]. It’s intense, that’s where
all the energy comes from, if you get a
great dig and you get an awesome kill.
That pretty much“ makes the game what it
IS. . I I .

TPN:... What goes throughiyour mind C

before each serve?

  GU: That’s kind of hard to say. You’re ‘

thinking about so many different things on
the court, but then you try not to think
because if you  too much, tl1en_ you
make errors. ,I think: it’s pretty much just
play-by-play, what needs to be done. If

you need this kill, you  “I’m’ going to .
put this ball away.” If you need a dig, _.ﬂ1en. "

“I’m going to getthere and dig thatlball.”

TPN: What would you say is the ‘most
embarrassing thing that’s ever happened

  - .~-. .g 3 ,5 3 '3 .2 c": :u 1" ".‘il‘8 2. u’ n. 3:‘:-\.cw.n -u:~s':~.n.n.-2.1:: ztrt-'n3131.u

GU: [laughs] The most embarrassing
thing? I actually have a lot. I’d have to say
my freshman year, my first game ever
starting, I hit our middle [hitter] in the
back of the head on game point. It was
heartbreaking. With everything on the
line, to stay in the game, and I ended up
making that error. V

TPN: What’s the funniest or oddest.

sounding term or- phrase you use in vol-
leyball? 4

GU: I can’t tell you what I say, because
that’s not appropriate. We don’t really

 

have a phrase that we use. The one we
always like to say is, “Go Pitt.”

TPN: What’s something that people

would be surprised to know about you?
GU: I don’t really know  everybody
knows I’m a loud person. On the court,
I’m pretty much the loudest person on the
court.

TPN: What is the biggest difference
between Pittsburgh and California?

GU: Socially?
TPN: Anything.
GU: It snows, and I love  [laughs] I love

Great working conditions in a

Suspension needed whether

accusations are true or false

No one asked for my opinion,
but...
°Whether' or not he is charged with
assault, Rod Rutherford should be sus-
pended for Saturday’s game against
Kent State.

Not because he possibly assaulted
someone or broke

any local, state .or     

federal law, but
because he possibly
broke head coach
Walt Harris’ laws.
I’m not a sure
whether or not the
players have a cur-
few for nights other
than before a game. However, I think
it’s safe to bet that the fact that
Rutherford was outside a club at 2:30
in the morning less than a week before
the first game of what should be Pitt’s
best season in over 20 years does not
make Harris happy.
If Harris doesn’t suspend
Rutherford, then it shows the rest of the
team that they too could get away with

breaking team rules. Not to mention.
a the fact that, to the publ_ic,it says that
. . Rutherford is exempt because he is: the

starting quarterback.

Besides, the opponent on Saturday
is Kent State, not N otre Dame or
Miami. The Panthers should be fine
without Rutherford at quarterback, and
it would be good to allow Luke Getsy
to finally get some game experience, in
case he is needed further down the
road.

°It is unfortunate that Joey Porter hap-
pened to be in the wrong place at the
wrong time this past weekend and he is

lucky that he wasn’t hurt more severe- .

ly.

But getting shot in the butt? No
matter what the situation, that has to be
somewhat embarrassing.

°If either the Chicago Cubs or the‘

Boston Red Sox win the World Series
this year, Pirates general manager
David Littleﬁeld should get a ring.

The Pirates gave the Red Sox their

best starter in Jeff Suppan and their
best left—handed setup guy in Scott
Sauerbeck, not to mention that they got
back pitcher Brandon Lyon, as well.
While those pitchers haven’t been

 

lighting it up for the Red Sox, they
could all play a significant role in
Boston’s playoff chances.

But if Littlefield helped bolster the
Red Sox pitching staff, he practically
built the Cubs starting lineup.

First, it was Kenny Lofton and
Aramis  Ramirez,
both of whom hap-
pened to fill gaping
holes that Chicago
had in centerfield
and at third base.
Then, Littlefield
shipped Randall
Simon to the windy
city,4/giving the Cubs
a left-handed ﬁrst baseman that could
fill in‘ for Eric Karros.

One-third of the Cubs offense is
made up of former Pirates, and that’s
not including Moises Alou, who came
up through Pittsburgh’s farm system in
the late 1980s.

 

°Just seeing the Cubs or the Red Sox in
the World Series would be amazing
enough. ,

A , Before 1940, Chicago and Boston
played in a combined 14 Fall Classics,
with the Red Sox appearing in —-— and
winning —— five championship series
and the Cubs making nine World Series
appearances, winning two of them.

But since then, the two teams have
been to only five of the last 62 World
Series. Boston’s last trip came in 1986,
while the Cubs haven’t been to a World
Series since 1945.

Adding to that history of futility is
that the last time the Red Sox won a
World Series, the Treaty of Versailles
had yet to be signed and the world’s
super powers were forming a league of
their own.

As for the Cubs, the last time they
won a World Series, Russia was still
over a decade away from becoming the

. Soviet Union and the United States was

still adhering to the Monroe Doctrine.

With that in mind, I think it’s safe
to assume that if either team wins the
World Series this year, the end of the
world just might be upon us.

Women’s soccer salvages final game versus Jacksonville, 5-l

Soccer, page 15

goal by Shannon Wing at the 69-minute
mark. She headed the ball past Jamie Pelusi
from a corner kick by Courtney Haarhues.

Central Florida’s ﬁnal goal came on a
penalty kick by Patty MacDowe11. Panthers
goalie Jamie Pelusi stopped six of the nine
shots she faced, while Golden Knights
goalie Julie Snaman stopped‘ one shot.

Chin said that none of goals that Pelusi
allowed were her fault. Aside from a short
lull in play after a strong start, Chin was sat-
isﬁed with the way the Panthers looked in
the first game, especially the way they con-
tinued to ﬁght when the Golden Knights
went ahead. ' I

After Wing put the Panthers behind,
Chin said she wag happy to see how the
team continued pushing to tie the score.

“I wish we could play them again,”
Tipton said. “We played well for the ﬁrst
game. Even though we lost, it didn’t get our
hopes down.”

the snow.

TPN: Had you seen snow before coming
to Pitt? '

GU: I saw it up in Reno, but I’d never
lived in it. The ﬁrst time I came here, I
loved it. I wanted to make snow angels
outside, but my roommates wouldn’t go
Wiﬂi me. I went sledding for the ﬁrst time
inthe ﬁrst snow when we got back from
Christmas, and all the teammates went
with me. I had the time of my life. It was

a great experience. We were laughing and I

Pitt 5, Jacksonville 1

In Monday’s game, Pitt played conﬁ-
dently against the Dolphins and erased the
aftertaste of Saturday’s game. The Panthers
attempted 11 shots on the net in the ﬁrst half
and were up 3-0 by the 12-minute mark
They sustained the effort through 90 min-
utes to gain a split on the trip. -

Chin said the team was more organized
in its Victory. '

“They held the ball better,” she said.
“They were more intense. There was more
defensive pressure and turnovers created.”

In the opener, Tipton shot from the left
corner off of a rebound from a shot by

Gutting. She put in her second goal less than
three minutes later after a shot by Gutﬁng
deﬂected off of a Jacksonville defender.

“Emily had good timing and good posi-
tioning,” Chin said.

Gutting assisted on both goals, and
Agredano also picked up an assist on the
ﬁrst

8 "Jennifer DeLaHoz notched the third
goal at the 12-minute mark, carrying the ball
to the goal after a pass from Erin Hills.

Gutting, assisted by Kristina Francois,
and Carli Brill ﬁnished Pitt’s scoring with
goals in ﬂie ﬁnal ten minutes‘.

, Pelusi stopped seven of eight shots in
the win. The Dolphins tallied their only goal

. when Ranveig Aas—Hanssen made an unas~

sisted goal inside the penalty box late in the
ﬁrst half. .~

According to Tipton, the Panthers fol-
lowed the scouting report given to them by
the coaches.

“We went in knowing to pressure their

[defensive] bacls,” she said “We knew their
goalie was their weakest player.”

Chin said the traveling experience was
a good opportunity for the freshman on the
team to spend time with upperclassmen and
for the veterans to get to know newcomers.

The Panthers compete again this
Saturday, at Founders Field, against
Maryland—Baltimore County.

TPN: Snow makes us laugh and giggle,
too. A - '
