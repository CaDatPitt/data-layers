Tom Kane, associate professor in
the Department of Speech and
Theater Arts, toured the Soviet
Union as part of an international
exchange program on debate. K

Kane, who is the director of the
William Pitt Debate union, was
selected as coach by the Committee
on International Discussion and
Debate. The committee is part of
the Speech Communications
Association (SCA).

Three students were also selected
by SCA to participate in the debate.
The students were required to
possess fluency in Russian and
debating skills. According to Kane,
the students ‘selected were those
who best met the qualifications.

Moscow on Oct. 10 and for sixteen
days toured six universities.

In addition to a university in
Moscow, the team also debated at
universities in Lithuania, Moldavia,

the Ukraine, Armenia and Siberia.-

According to Kane, debate in
Russia is quite different than the
style Americans are familiar with.

“The debate was a combination
of discussion,” Kane ‘said. “The
three Americans and the three Rus-
sians each gave speeches, each one
rotating.”

The topic of this year’s exchange
program concerned the responsibili-
ty of the individual to the state. The
two teams took different ‘positions

Profs May Join. Ranks of ‘Working
Poor ;Lawmakers, Public to Blame

By SCOT STONE
Pitt News Staff Writer’

If present trends continue, low
ranked academicians will enter the
ranks of the working poor in the
1980‘s and full professors will join
them by the year 2000.

This scenario, -according to
Richard Thorn, president of the
Pittsburgh chapter of the American
Association of University Pro-
fessors (AAUP), and professor of
economics at Pitt, will occur unless
something radical happens in the
next few years.

Thorn delivered his statements at
a press conferesce in the Pitt Facul-
ty club, last Friday.

His reasons for making a state-‘

ment were that the faculty position ’

is continuing to decline and also
that an attempt will be made by an
AFL-CIO affiliate to organize the
faculty at Pitt.

“Unionizin-g is a very sensitive
question here, and it’s a very sen-

there wasn’t a real pro or con side.
Therefore, there was no winner,
Kane explained. ‘

The crux of the debate, however,
was the questions posed by the au-
dience to the debators at the end of

’ the discussion.

The audience’s size ranged from
300 to 1,000 people. The highest
turnout, comprised mostly of
students, was in Siberia.

“We were six hours late getting
there because of weather. But the
people waited those six hours for
us,” Kane, said. That particular
debate was televised because of the
interest.

“Most of the people, especially
out of Moscow, were seeing

~ Americans for the first time, Kane
explained. “They were curious
about us.”

The Student Council of the
‘USSR sponsored the debate in

sitive question for my organization
which represents professors across
the university. But I would say this:
that the kind of pressure on them is
desperation, they feel they’ve tried
everything else for almost a decade,
and they haven’t seen any basic im-

provement in their situation, ”
Thorn said. '
According to Thorn, the

statements were not just directed at
the university administration, or the
state legislature, but at the public
too.

“I believe that the public is most
important of the three. We don’t
see a possibility for improvement
until the public becomes aware of
the situation in our
universities, ’ ’Thorn said.

The problem, according to
Thorn, stems from two basic
causes: inflation and dependence on
the state legislature for money.
Also, the problem is compounded
by the contraction of the student

with approximately two million 

people.
“They regard the exchange as be-
ing very important,” Kane said.

population,
Thorn, has the effect of creating the
economic setting which allows
faculty salaries to be held down.

As a result, faculty members are
forced to “moonlight,” or find
work elsewhere. The colleges and
universities in this state, according
to Thorn, “are in the process of
slowly dying.”

“In the decade of the seventies,
while other professional groups

maintained or improved their real‘

economic incomes, the real incomes

of faculty membersgof universities’

and colleges have declined 18 per-
cent,” he added. ‘
Despite a nine percent pay raise
at Pitt, inﬂation caused the greatest
decline in real earnings “in
memory,” according to Thorn.

Revenues divide up evenly bet- ’

ween tuition, research grants and

contracts, and state aid, according

to Thorn. Because increases in tui-

ed with Kiev.

“The city was bombed by the
Germans and it had to be rebuilt. It
wasn’t a plastic city, though. It still
retains the culture it had before it
was destroyed,” said Kane.

As a whole, Kane said his greatest
impression of the Soviet Union was
“how much they know about us;
both accurate and inaccurate at the
same time.”

He cited as examples the
knowledge of America’s economic
ﬁgures, dissident cases and the U.S.
election, down to some senatorial

Interview: Nathan Stark in Townl   
To Announce Pitt Health Grant

Nathan Stark is currently an undersecretary in the Health and Human
services (HHS) department for the federal government. Stark was in Pitts-
burgh last week to announce the awarding of a $153,000 grant to Pitt for
the development of training and research centers in long-term health care.
Stark, a former Pitt vice chancellor for the health services, also said he will
be returning to Pitt next year. ’ '

In the following interview conducted by the Assistant Pitt News news
editor Mary Kane and the University Times, Stark explained the grant and
offered some thoughts on long-term health care. 4
Q.Can you explain some of the specifics of the grant?

A.It’s a part of our long-term care strategy. I’m chairman, as an
undersecretary, of the task force which consistsof the department heads
throughout the agency on the impact of long-term care. As such, I’m trying
to work out policies to give the secretary some background on which to
make decisions. We will also make recommendations because the depart-

GrantAwarded for Developmentof Geriotric

By GARY SIMONE

A $1 million foundation grant for
the development of a Geriatric
Center was awarded to Pitt last
month.

The Claude Worthington
Benedum Foundation grant was the
result of a joint effort between
Pitt’s Psychiatry and Medical
departments according to Richard
Morycz, assistant professor
psychiatry.

Dr. Monica Bluementhal of the
Psychiatricdepartment, along with
Dr. Michael Karpf and Dr. Gerry S.
Levey of Pitt’s. Medical department
submitted a propsal concerning
geriatrics to the foundation. Accor-
ding to Morycz, the resulting award
will help to expand the University
Health Center.

“The money will be used to

create a model curriculum and ser-

vice program for the elderly,”
Morycz said.

He cited the lack of trained peo-
ple such as psychiatrists, nurses and
social workers who are capable of
dealing with senior citizens. Morycz
said the grant will contribute to the
elimination this void through
special training.

The grant money has not yet been
received because the money is being
held by the foundation until final
preparations on the specifics of the
center are completed, according to
Morycz. July 1981, is the tentative
date for the use of the grant to
begin.

There is “specialty of pediatrics
but no geriatrics,” Morycz said,
commenting on
geriatraic care. He added that a
geratrics program would benefit the
elderly and be a service to the com-
munity. ‘

“The Geriatric Center will be just

for old people, 60 years of age and

up,” Morycz said. “It would ‘be
based in the Medical School where

‘ed states
the state of-

individuals such as occupational
therapists, psychiatrists, social
workers and nurses would be
available,” he added.

“The Geriatric Center will not
study disease specifically but rather
develop a service facility and good
curriculum for this health field,”
Morycz said.

Morycz‘ described aging as a
social trend. “People are living
longer and becoming more
vulnerable to medical, social and
psychological problems,” he said.

He added that this vulnerability
may lead to chronic illness, confus-
or depreession and
decreases in the functional
capabilities of an elderly individual.

“These problems interact with
one another resulting in a snow ball
effect. The individual becomes im-
mobilized by the problems and is
functionally dependent upon
others,” he said.

Morycz told how the service

and established the. program. It was

so successful that the City of Pitts-

burgh was influenced to institute

the program into the Department of
'Parks and Recreation.

Sue Mansfield, director of the
program, said she believes that
“this program is invaluable,to"the
community.” Judging from’ the
more than 200 particpants in the
program, children and adults alike,
the program is a success she added.

“Although other cities in the
United States offer, similar pro-
grams, Pittsburgh’s is unique,”
Mansfield claimed. “It was started
by agencies who came, together
cooperatively in order to influence
the city government to pick up such
a program.”

It is the newest program and run
differently from the others in that it
offers a large variety of activities.

plans to deal with these problems:
“We will be attempting to look at
people in a multidimensional man-
ner, hoping, in general, to improve
their overall health,” he said.

Morycz said that the current
medical practice, when dealing with
the elderly, is to give different
medicines for different problems.
“This results in a drug toxicity
which may also create confusion
within an individual of this age
group.” he asserted.

“Fragmented care is not as good
as comprehensive care which aids in

improving the overall condition,”
Morycz said.

As for the future, Morycz said
that plans include a day care center
for eldaerly people. Other plans are
to “create satelite centers in rural
areas, but that will be later on,” he
said. I

The Benedum Foundation is a
“private foundation in Pittsburgh
which tries to help programs with
special needs or ones that are possi-
ble models for the nation,” Morycz
said. “The foundation provides one
time monies to help things get
started.”

Presidential Hopefuls Differ on Dorm Rules

Student government board
presidential candidates hold vastly
different views on the visitation
policy, a major issue in this year’s
Student Government presidential
race. '

Candidate Russell Rice said he

“The present board members
have become administrative pup-
pets and have not adequately
represented the “students,” Rice ad-
ded. “This has caused disunity
among the entire student body and
enabled the administration to have
this dorm policy implemented.”

believes the visitation policy is an
important matter with resident
students and must be addressed by
student government. However, Rice
said this problem cannot be ad-
dressed until student government
itself_ is strengthened.

ELECTION

“My main priority is to organize
students to rally behind and support
student government,” Rice said.
“Once this has been accomplished,
student government’s voice will be
heard by the administration.

Candidate Martin Bertocchi
believes it is the student’s right to
have visitors past the 2:00 a.m.

organized mass violation resulting

ticularly burdensome that none of our paraprofessionals or our profes-
sional health people, just as one example, are as concerned about the pro-
blems of the elderly as we think they should be. So in addition to doing a
number of things like a channeling program, we just put forward to coor-
dinate and manage individuals.

What we're trying to do here in this grant, which is one of six given to the
six universities around the country, is to ask the university to inventory all
of the needs of those people who are in rural areas and the minorities as to
help in long-term care. Then come back to us and say: these are the ways
we believe we ought to be educating our physicians, our nurses, and other
paraprofessionalsto impact on these people and their problems. And that’s
the gist of the grant.

Q.Could you tell me a little about your background?

A.Well, I started in industry. I’m a lawyer who went into industry. And
then I came to the university, where I was the vice chancellor and president
of the health center. Then I took a leave of absence to become an
undersecretary. -

, Q.You mentioned that in the department; of HHS, one of your concerns, if

notyou top concern, is long-term care. Will that carry into the next ad-
ministration if it wouldn’t be a Carter administration?

A.We’re hoping that we may have institutionalized a number of programs
within HHS now that will be carried forward, such as many of the pro-
grams in the administration on aging and a few of the programs on children
and youth. The policy direction really hasn't been so stabilized; we have a
channeling program that I mentioned before that I think will give enough
information back after two or threeyears so that they can come up with a
better "policy decision. But my one hope is that whoever comes into this job
after I have left it, whether its a Carter administration or any other, that
they will adopt the same position that we have, that this is of great concern
to the nation and, therefore, should be given a top priority within the
department‘. Also that they will utilize a great many of the things that we
have put together. For example, we have commissioned issue papers from
people outside of government on this subject. We have inventoried every
kind of service that is available at the present within government and out-
side of government. Those are all very useful tools. We have dealt with
every agency that has anything to do with long-term care, whether its for
children and youth or for the elderly. And they’ve met with us on any
number of occasions. They have helped us formulate a number of decision-
making programs. We're at a loss to carry these out, in many instances
until we get legislation. So the next thing we have to do is formulate/legisla-
tion based on some of our findings. Then it has to go through Congress. I
know I have every confidence with this administration, and I would hope
that if there is another administation, that we could somehow be per-
suasive. °

Q.If the Carter ‘administration is voted back into office, will you be
around? ‘ A

A.I’ll be here to consult. I’m planning to come back to the university. l’ve
had that on schedule. All who have interviewed me originally for this job
understood that that was my desire.

' Q;Do you have any specific goals in mind for your return to Pitt?

A.To take off where I left off, which is going to be very difficult because so

A much has happened ‘in ’the'y'e‘ar that I"v'e 'l5e'ei1'g'cirie’. ‘I‘t‘h‘ink ‘the thanceilor -

continued from page one

and I have some pretty good ideas that we were generating just today and I
would certainly want to follow up on them.

Q.What type of ideas?

A.I can’t be specific at this point because they’re all in the very early talking
stages.

Q.CouId you tell me some more about the grant, the length and the amount
of the money? '
A.$l53,000, and I think it’s a three-year grant. It’s to develop training and
research centers in long-term care services. Let me say this and I want to
note this very strongly, because it’s been something that l’ve talked about.
We need closer understanding between government and the private sectoar,
and the use of the private sector in dealing with government on the various
programs. One of the outstanding examples of this that I like to use was the
Benedum grant that was made to the University of Pittsburgh; One million
dollars for a geriatric health center. I think this is an excellent example of
how private foundations, aside from government, can stimulate an activity
which even government thinks is quite significant. .
Q.Did the awarding of the Benedum grant play any role in the awarding of
this grant?
A.I will say this. I can’t tell you that because I was not part of it, but I can
guess, that any time a university can demonstrate that they have private
funding for a particular program that is in line with the policies of the
federal government in their granting, they will stand a better chance of get-
ting that grant for a good reason: the federal government looks not only at
the reputation of the university but the people who are going to be involved
in implementing that grant. If you have something like the Benedum grant,
you’re going to attract some very good people on an ongoing basis. You
know they’re not going to be here for one year then have the budget cut
under them and have to be relieved. We in the federal government look at
that as a sign of stability of personnel. Far too often‘ we give grants to
anyone, whether it’s an institution or an agency, where the principal pro-
ject director leaves and then the whole thing goes to pot.
Q.Would you say Pitt has a reputation for stability then?
Pitt has an excellent reputation now, much better than the reputation it had
when I first came to Pitt. I didn’t develop it, the chancellor did, but this is
evidenced very clearly by the number of grants the university has been able
to get in the past two years. It’s increased 25 percent, which is very con-
siderable.
Q.How do you think the university improved its reputation? ’

A.Well,‘I think the university had a good reputation before this, but what
we lacked was a coordinated cohesive way of approaching grant
mechanisms. For example, the Office of Research has had a remarkable
role, not only in stimulating grant procurement, but in coordinating the
grant applications throughout the university. I can remeber a time in
Washington when I was told, “Your grant is competing with a grant in
some other school,” and we didn’t know it. Now there’s no reason why the
two schools or departments couldn’t get together and submit a proposal
and that way we would have a much better chance of getting the grant. All
this has been done within the past two years, and at a time when there’s a
declining amount of money available for grants. The money is getting
-tighter: the budget constraints are there.

in a change of the visitation policy.
Bertocchi said he sees this mass
violation resulting in a change of
the policy as well as generating stu-
dent interest and involvement in
student government, which he
claims is his first priority.
According to Bertocchi, his pro-
posal is designed for students to
“take a risk.” To assure its success,
Bertocchi said he would work with
various groups, including Resident
Student Association (RSA) and the
Inter-Frater.nity Council, to
organize the night(s) on which the
mass violation would take place.

As a current SGB member,-Ben
tocchi said he believes the board has
not done all it could concerning
the visitation policy. He com-
mented on the meeting last winter
with Dr. Kimbo, vice-chancellor of
Student Affairs, that drew over 600
students protesting the policy.

“It was our responsibility (SGB)
to take the initiative and we
didn’t,”Bertocchi said. He explain-
ed dampers have been put on SGB
action protesting the visitation
policy by current SGB president Bill
Abraham and the administration.

Current board president Bill
Abraham said he believes accoun-
tibility is most important in the
visitation policy. He added that
any overnight guest should be re-
quired to leave a substantial form

I of identification with a desk atten-

dant and one’s sex should not enter
into it. i

Abraham said he wants to con-
duct a survey of all .4200 dorm
residents, not a random 50 or 100
residents as has been suggested, on
the visitation policy for an accurate
evaluation.

Another SGB approach to the
visitation policy Abraham endorses
includes getting a parade permit to
protest and having a sit-in at a
board of trustees meeting. These
are alternatives to a mass violation
because they do not break rules, and
could not judged as immature,
Abraham said.

Abraham added that sororities
participating in the mass violation
stand a chance of losing their na-
tional charters and students going
on to professional schools could be
hindered by such participation.

, As the current president of the
SGB, Abraham said he believes the
board has had its hands tied up un-
til now regarding the visitation
policy. According to Abraham, the
RSA wanted to deal with the visita-
tion policy on their own last winter.
In addition, during the spring and
summer sessions there were only
600 dorm residents whichlthc ad-

.ministration said did not warrant
evaluation of the policy. After afull

action will be winterlterm '

Attorney Cites FBI Corruption; Doubts U.S. Justice System

By PEGGY FERRI
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Is there justice in America?”
William Kunstler, noted activist at-
torney, addressed this question in a
Nov, 7 speech, citing several ex-
amples of the FBI’s “dirty deeds”
and bringing to the audience’s at-
tention a bill entitled the FBI
Charter.

“Society uses the law to oppress
and sometimes I’m ashamed to be
part of the proccess. But I remain
within the law because of the ﬂex-
ibilities that make it possible to
utilize it,” Kunstler said.

“I know there are certain people
who are termed as outlaws, people
who become feared by society to the
extent that they are outside the law.
This means they can be harrassed,
searched, have their homes broken
into, and even be caused to kill each
other.”

According to Kunstler, the
leading proponent of this has been
the FBI; although they are not the

only ones.
To support this assertion,
Kunstler introduced several ex-

amples in which the FBI was

Kane said that most of the news

about America in the Soviet Union
is bad news.

“The facts were in the wrong
perceptional framework,”‘ Kane

said. “For example, they think that _
_ unemployment in the U.S. means

great poverty. People without
homes, etcetera. They don’t know
about unemployment compensation
or welfare.” *

According to Kane, the Soviet
Union has no unemployment
because all citizens are guaranteed
job.

“Jean Seburg’s crime was the she
went to a Black Panther fund raiser
in 1966. The FBI wrote an
anonymous letter to the Los
Angeles Times that said Seburg,
who was pregnant, was pregnant by
a Black Panther. She promptly had
a miscarriage, the baby was white,
and last November succeeded in

killing herself.

“All this was a direct result of the
FBI sending dirty, anonymous let-
ter,” Kunstler explained. ’

“As a result of other anonymous
letters, nineteen members of thethe
Black Panthers died.

“This is murder,” Kunstler em-
phasized, “and if you set murder
into motion, then you are guilty.”

After citing several other com-
plex examples involving among
others, Martin Luther King and
Black Panther leader I-Iuey
Newton, Kunstler explained his
theory behind such actions on the
FBI’s part.

“The theory was to destroy
minority leadership. Their unity

“If they’re not available to do the
dirty jobs in society, there’s no one
else.

“They have to destroy Third
World leadership wherever it
arises.”

“Although the proof of the FBI’s
unethical practices was not all re-
cent,” Kunstler said, “The FBI is
still after blacks.”

“Last April, at 2:00 A.M., in a
Harlem apartment house occupied
by affluent blacks, the FBI bust in,
pistol-whipped a black youth, and
all on the theory that they were
looking for a prison escapee.”

Kunstler asked the audience:
“Can you see this done to whites?”

-“No,” he answered. “Because
blacks have one-tenth the rights of
whites.

Kunstler then explained the FBI
Charter: '

“It is a bill that legalized
everything I've talked about; it says
an agent can ‘commit any crime as
long as it is necessary for cover.
And,” he added, “They are im-
mune to prosecution. If they overdo

it a little, they have to pay a $5,000
fine.

“Also pending is a revision of the
Federal penal code called Sl. It
defines a riot as a group of three or
more people, and punishes the
picketing of anuclear plant with

ten years and a fine of up to
$500,000.”

“I hope you take a good look at
it because your new Congress is go'-
ing to pass it.” Later, Kunstler said
he hopes that he is wrong and that it
will never be passed. .

“The system fears only chaos,
disruption, and militancy,”
Kunstler said. “I have nothing
against going into the system, but
you’ve got to understand you’re not
going to change it through the
system.” '

Has the FBI. done ‘anything for
the good of the country?

“I’m tempted to say no,”
Kunstler answered. “There would

. be no harm done by abolishing the

FBI, and organization that pisses
money off on things like ABSCAM;

around.

Kunstler commented on the
perception of non-involvement of
students in today’s issues as com-
pared with the sixties.

“The draft didn’t create much of

Opinion

Bertocchi,
Reluctantly  

The Pitt News is dissatisfied with this year’s Stu-1

 dent Government Board presidential candidates.-
 The presidential election has narrowed to a choice
j f between the ineffective policies of incumbent Bill
A Abraham and the unrealistic solutions offered by
 challenger Martin Bertocchi.
 A third candidate, Russell Rice, lacks both the ex-
 perience and knowledge of student government to
 function as aboard president. . ,
Endorsements, become necessary, however,
because we believe student organizations (and

 

representatives. -

L, It is with some reluctance, then, that we endorse
Es “Bertocchi for president. -

 Abraham and Bertocchi have differed greatly in
 their approaches to various student issues, and the
difference is mainly one of attitudes. .

Abraham has advocated establishing a close rela-

  

students) should take an active role in choosing their .

with the vice chancellor and the‘chancellor’s office,
and I don’t think changing that right now and break-
ing that continuity is going_to be healthy for student
government,” Abraham said. »

In addition, Abraham has labeled Bertocchi’s
views as radical, and has said a radical approach
would not be well received by the administration.

However, Abraham's cooperative relationship
with the administration has been ineffective thus far.

“We’ve got a visitation policy we don’t want; and
I don’t see where we benefited from it,” Bertocchi
‘said.

Abraham’s administration has also - been
characterized by a failure to communicate with
students and SGB committees. K

For example, standing committee chairmen were
never informed of the changes in SGB bylaws that

prohibited them from electing their chairmen until ,

after the fact. a -

But Bertocchi’s solutions are short sighted and ex-
treme. V

The success of Bertocchi’s idea for mass violation
of the visitation policy is doubtful. Bertocchi would
have to organize and involve all student groups
against the fear of administrative reprisal, and even
this would not insure administrative reaction.

Bertocchi-’s campaign literature is misleading; we
can not credit Bertocchi with supportfor the cause of
Curtiss Porter when he failed to even -mention
Porter’s name in the Black Studies resolution he
authored.

proposal,” Scott Hendler was t-he only board
member to vote against a pro draft registration pro-.
posal; Bertocchi abstained.

Bertocchi’s asset is that he has indicated a desire_to
establish change, and to curb administrative in-
ﬂuence with student organizations.

We hope that a responsible board will be able to
check Bertocchi’s excesses, and attempt to ac-
complish these goals. _

With this in mind, we have endorsed the following
SGB candidates: Todd DeLuca, Peter Karlovich, and
Mark Stevens. - , t _ _ V

DeLuca, through his former position as co-
chairman of the Legal Awareness.Committee, has a
great deal of experience dealing with students, and a
firsthand knowledge of the issues effecting student
government.

Experience is also a factor in choosing Karlovich. '

A former Commuter Affairs Committee chairman
and currently editor of the commuter’ newsletter,The
Magic Bus, Karlovich is a qualified representative for
Pitt’s commuters, who comprise a majority of the
undergraduate population.

_ Freshman Stevens is both articulate and unique in
expressing his ; ideas about student government.
Stevens’ common sense would be a welcome addition
to the board. _

Nearly all the candidates have agreed on one point:
student apathy is a problem at Pitt. Whether students
agree with these endorsements or not, we urge them

Letters

To the Editor:

L On Friday, October 17, 1980, the
 Pitt News published an article con-
:.cerning the prospective relocation
“ of the University Catering Service
s in Forbes Hall Residence. As
 stated, ‘many Forbes residents are
it very concerned and frustrated
‘W, about this possible decision. This
.. frustration has surmounted in the
» last few weeks because of a lack of
 response from‘University officials
. who have been contacted in an at-
ll tempt by Forbes residents to clarify
 some of the issues and to gain more
 information on the progress of th
plans to relocate. ‘

, The first attempt was on Thur-
? sday, October 9, when three Forbes
Hall Council members made visits
f: to the offices of Vice-Chancellor
{fKimb_o, Vice-Chancellor Dutton,
ifand Senior Vice-Chancellor
, Freeman. Kimbo was out of town
jfor the weekend and both others
1 were not available at the time. On
? the next day, two students met with
\ Assistant Vice-Chancellor Varana
 of the Business and Finance Office.
7 At this meeting, the concerns of the
 hall residents were expressed and in-
cluded the following: sanitation‘,
 security. tire;-:Iiat;=atd~.~i>re:ea:utto:ns;

   
  
   
  
 
  
   
  
  
  
   
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
 
 
 

 

parking, and study conditionsin the
dorm during the rennovations. Dr.
Varana, although sympathetic to
our concerns, expressed that there
‘was no other space as feasible not
convenient for the relocation. Con-
tradictory to the claims of Tom

V Albert, Director of Au_xil1ary Ser-
- vices (which the Catering Service is

a part of), Varana claimed the move
would probably be permanent since
the catering service has been shuffl-
ed among locations since its‘ beginn-
ing.

Prior to the meeting with Varana,
hall council residents met with
Albert on Oct. 1. This initial
meeting served to inform Albert

about the students’ concern and
revealed to the students that no of-
ficial plans had yet been made. The
next week Mr. Albert was scheduled
to talk with Forbes Hall Council
but later cancelled in order to have
more time to gather cost estimates
on’ the relocation. Albert requested
4-5 days in order to gather these
figures, but to this day it has been 4
weeks and he has still not met with
the Forbes Hall Council. '
Although all administrators that
have been contacted agree that the

final and still under consideration,
the Forbes Hall housekeeping and
maintenance personnel were in-
structed a month ago to remove
all of the stored /furniture and
‘ equipment out of the area on the
2nd floor, west wing.

It was learned today, November
3, that the cost figures have been
completed and have been handed
up to the Space Planning level.
Albert still has not agreed to talk 9
with Forbes residents until plans are
further- completed. Forbes residents’
are still concerned about the reloca-
tion and would like to know what
progress has been made with its ‘
planning. Every further postpone-
ment of the meeting with the
residents is giving the Auxiliary Ser-
vice and the Space Allocation of-
fices more time to complete their
plans without student involvement.
But the greatest advantage to the
administration resulting from this
delay is the creation of a period of
time to allow the students to “cool
down” and perhaps forget about
their concerns.

Fortunately, the students are still
concerned and plan to pursue this

‘LAC Explains What to Do After Getting a Traffic Ticket

Receiving traffic tickets is an an-
noying problem for students at Pitt.
If you are ticketed, you can do one
of three things:

1. Ignore the ticket. A ticket is a
criminal complaint and must be
dealt with rationally. If it is not
dealt with properly, you could lose
your driving privileges and be sub-
ject to formal arrest. Don’t ignore
the ticket.

2. Plead guilty and pay the ticket.
Procedure is explained on the back
_‘;.he ticket. This system relies on
the -fact that people know when
they're in the wrong and will admit
it. Also, it can be cheaper to pay
the ticket before the court date than
after a finding of ‘guilty’ by the
court. If you’re considering
pleading ‘guilty,’ first determine the
effect on your driver’s license: se-
cond, determine the severity of the
penalty to be imposed. If either of

these are a possibility, immediately -

procure legal counsel.

3. Plead innocent and pursue
your remedy in court. If you
(defendant) wish to pursue your
remedy in court rather than
pleading guilty to the charge, it is to
your benefit to understand what to
expect in court.

0 At the time a ticket is given, it is
usually accompanied by a form
which can be used to enter a plea of
“not guilty.” If such a form is
available, fill out the form accor-
ding to its instructions and send it
where indicated and within the

speciﬁed time limit. If the form is
not available, or it is too late to use
this method of pleading, appear in
court on the day and at the time in-
dicated. Q

On the day of arraignment you
will be asked to plead guilty or not
guilty and to either request or waive
your right to trial by a jury. If you
plead not guilty, a trial date will be
set (Note: In some jurisdictions the
trial and the arraignment date are
the same).

On the trial date, all of the par-
ticipants appear before the bench
when the clerk calls the case. At
this point the judge will ask if there
are any opening statements. If you
wish to say something, your
remarks should concern _what you
hope to show as evidence. In
general, it is best not to make any
opening statements.

The State presents its case first.
The State’s Attorney (or City At-
torney) will be present and will elicit
information from the witnesses to
your alleged offense; usually this
witness is a police officer. When
the State’s Attorney has no more
questions to ask of the police of-
ficer, you have the opportunity to
question the witness (cross-
examination). Police officers are
accomplished witnesses, as a result,
a cross-examination may not elicit
helpful information. If you feel
justified in asking the officer ques-
tions, do so respectfully and
courteously.

After the prosecution has
presented its witness, you, the
defendant, present your case. But
before doing so, you have the right
to request the Court to dismiss the
case against you. Such a request is
worthwhile only if some element of
the charges has not been testified to
or if there is a significant discrepan-
cy between the testimony given and
the charge itself. If minor things
such as a mis-stated address appear
on the ticket, this will be of no help
to you. If you were apprised ade-
quately of the charge against you,
the complaint will be considered
sufficient. However, if the ticket
alleges that you were speeding while
driving a Ford on Route 30 and the
officer testified that you were
speeding while driving a Honda on
Route 23, the case should be
dismissed.

When presenting your case, begin
by making an opening statement.
Then testify in your own behalf.
You are attempting to provide suf-
ficient information to the court to
distinguish the facts as alleged by
the prosecution. If you feel that
visual materials might be helpful in
clarifying the situation, present
them to the court. After you have
explained your position you will
probably be cross-examined by the
prosecution. You may want to pre-
sent witnesses, if you have any.
They can testify as to what they
saw, and may also be cross-
examined by the Attorney.

Upon completion of your case,

Panthers Devour Cardinals, 41-23  

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Sports Writer

Rick Trocano broke the Pitt all-
time passing record and Hugh
Green’s number 99 was retired

_Saturday as the Panther football
team soundly defeated Louisville,

. 41-23

Trocano completed 11 of 22
passes for 231 yards and two
touchdowns, giving him 3,659 total
yards as a Pitt passer. Green
became only the second player in
Pitt history to have his number
retired, the other being Tony
Dorsett. ,

“Trocano is a superb quarter-
back and had an outstanding after-
noon,” said Louisville coach Bob
Weber. ‘,.‘It’s tough to beat a team
when you have a day like his.

“Hugh Green is Hugh Green--the
best,” he added. “He has to be a
-leading contender for the Heisman.
You can’t go away from him
because he’s so quick he gets across
the ﬁeld to get in on the play.”

‘ Green had a total of 11 tackles on
the day, including one sack.
Though Louisville scored 23 points,
the nationally-ranked Pitt defense
held the Cardinals to only 191 total
net yards. Twenty of Louisville’s 23
points eame as a direct result of Pitt
turnovers.

After a scoreless first quarter,
Louisville got on the board first
with a 34-yard field goal. On the
Panthers’ ensuing drive, Trocano
fumbled at the Pitt 36,. but the ball
rolled to the six—yard line where
Louisville recovered.

Two plays later, Cardinal
quarterback Dean May passed com-
plete to Robert Mitchell in the end-

zone for a touchdown. The extra.

point was no good and the Car-
dinals led, 9-0. -

Panther fans sat shocked as Pitt
came to life to score four minutes
later on a 24-yard Dave Trout field

goal. On Louisville’s next offensive
series, the Cards were faced with a
fourth-and—two at their own 28.
Punter Mark Blasinsky went back
to punt, but was rushed and tried
instead to run with the ball. He was
tackled by ‘Ricky Jackson back at
the 20-yard line where Pitt took
over possession.

On five successive runs by Randy
McMillan, who had 86 yards for the
day, Pitt moved the ball down to
the Louisville one. With a second-
and-goal, Joe McCall went over
right guard for a one-yard
touchdown. The extra point was
good and Pitt was in front to stay,
10-9.

After Louisville couldn’t move
with the ball, Blasinsky punted to
Julius Dawkins who was standing at
his own 41. He returned the ball ’32
yards to the Louisville 27. On the
first play of the offensive drive,
Trocano passed complete to Dwight
Collins in the left corner of the end-
zone for the second Pitt
touchdown. With the extra point,
Pitt led 17-9. »

A key play was made by Carlton
Williamson on the next Louisville
possession as he intercepted a May
pass and returned it to the Cardinal
22-yard line.

Trocano was unable to move the
ball after making it down to the 13,
so Trout was’ called in to kick a
30-yard field goal to end the half
with Pitt leading 20-9..

The Panther offense literally ex-
ploded in the third quarter, scoring
three times during a nine-minute
span. The first touchdown was set
up by another Dawkins return, this
one a 35-yarder which took the ball
down to the Louisville 13. The Pan-
thers were aided by a personal foul
penalty which took the ball down to
the six. On the next play, with a
first and goal, McMillan went
around‘ the left end for a six—yard

touchdown. Trout added the extra
point to put Pitt in the lead, 27-9.

Pitt’s next drive started at the
Louisville 30, thanks to a Mark
Reichard interception. With a
fourth-and-goal at the two, Artrell
Hawkins took the ball in to the end-
zone for Pitt’s fourth touchdown.
Trout’s extra point made the score
35-9.

Near the end of the third quarter,
the Cardinal’s second quarterback,
Scott Gannon, threw another one
of the five Louisville interceptions
of the day. Terry White grabbed the
ball at the Pitt eight andreturned it

’ to the Panther 34-yard line.

A picture perfect touchdown pass
was on its way in this drive as, with
a second and 11 from the 33,

play. With the extra point, Pitt led

Louisville scored twice in the
final quarter on Pitt’s second team
to make the final score 41-23 Those
two touchdowns could make the

Pitt convincingly defeated the
Louisville Cardinals on Saturday by
a score of 41-23. Although the im-
pressive victory was very important
for the Panthers’ bowl hopes, that
seemed to take a back seat at two
different moments during the game.

During half-time, Pitt defensive
end Hugh Green was honored in a
ceremony for retirement of his
number 99 jersey. The only other
Panther player to have his number
retired was Tony Dorsett, and he
was a Heisman trophy winner and
the all-time leading rusher in
NCAA history.

- “I was at little scared,” said
Green, “because I wanted to play
well in my last home game. People
would come and say ‘Hugh’s
number is being retired’ so I didn’t
want to end with a bad game.”

Hugh Green's accomplishments
are spellbinding. Last year, he was
named first team All-America by
the following polls and magazines:
Associated Press, United Press
International, Walter Camp Foun-
dation, Newspaper Enterprises,
Kodak, Football News, Sporting
News and Playboy Magazine. In
all, Green has been a four-time All-
America and a three-time consensus
All-America.

Green was named to the Pitt All-
Time Team, which dates back to
1910, by a panel of Pittsburgh
sportswriters and broadcasters last

input

year.

“Hugh has been the best defen-
sive player in the country the past
three years in my opinion,” said
Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill. “Nobody
can do what he can do and nobody
had done what he has done at his
_position. He deserves the Heisman
Trophy;”

The ceremony at midfield was
emotional. Coach Sherrill hugged
Green in appreciation for the years
of excellent play. Green then held
up his jersey and turned so all of the
47,280 people could see it. The
chants for Green were literally rock-
ing the stadium. - T _

“I was raising up the shirt to
show the people my appreciation
for their support,” said Green.

Besides Hugh Green, the Pan-
thers will be losing a host of
outstanding seniors from Sherrill’s
first recruiting class. The general
feeling among the group“ of seniors
was that the game carried extra
meaning for them.

“It meant a lot for- me today
because it was the last home game,”
said senior split-end Willie Collier.
“We all really wanted to play well
and score a lot of points. Maybe we
can move up two notches (in the
polls) and then catch, Georgia in the
Sugar Bowl.”

“I wanted to make things happen
to let the people see me go out as I
came in,” said senior defensive end
Ricky Jackson. “Everybody came

in wanting to do something
special.” '

“It was an ernotional~experience- - ~ r

  Pitt Hockey Team Opens Season With 4-1 Win

By SCOT STONE
3‘~ Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt hockey team opened its
season by defeating the University
of ‘Ohio 4-1 on Saturday. Despite
long delays, claims of questionable
officiating, and a good deal of con-
fusion, the Panthers outskated and
out shot the Ohio team throughout
the game. , '

In the first period, both teams
looked nervous on the ice. Confu-
sion over penalties caused the
period to last almost 90 minutes.
When it was over, Pitt had racked
ugseven penalties, Ohio eight, and

- neither team had scored a point.

The second period was a com-
plete turn around. The Panthers
scored in the first four minutes,
with a power play goal by Cliff
Ziegler, and with assists coming
from Tom Coyne and Tom Robin-
son. ,

The Panthers came back eight
minutes later with a slight variation
on a basic theme, Robinson scoring

of the same, with an additional pair
of Pitt goals. Coyne got his turn to
score two minutes into the period,
and followed eight minutes later by
Jeff Hoien’s power play point.
Once again_ both plays were assisted
by Ziegler and Robinson.

The Ohio team managed to put
one into the net in the last 30

seconds of the game, on an even-
strength play by a winger named .

McCa1lister. ’

In between scoring drives, the
game was riddled with brawls and
penalties. Any player you talk to
will say intimidation is the name of
the game, and the Ohio Bobcats
managed to raise the ire of the Pan-
thers numerous times. In one
minor scuffle in the first period,
four players were penalized on both
teams for over ten minutes.

The general feeling is that the
responsibility for the level of play
rests with the referees.

“I seriously don’t like to be put-
ting the blame on somebody, but in

refereeing,” said Pitt head coach
Larry Newell.

“Those referees lost control of
that team (Ohio) from the start.
They made bad calls to start the
game off, and things went from
there,” Newell added.

But in general, Newell is very
happy with the win, and the way his
team played.

difference to the pollsters for this
week’s rankings, and Pitt coach
Jackie Sherrill had second thoughts
about his free substitution.

“I guess we played the younger
kids too early,” he said. -“You cer-

tainly don’t want to happen what‘

did. You feel like you want to give
your younger people time, but if I
1 had to do it all over again, I
wouldn’t have substituted so

“They played a disciplined brand

of hockey, they played what they
practiced,” Newell said. “I’m hap-
py with the win, but there’s a few
things we’re going to have to work
on.”
- Newell is pleased with his front
line, Ziegler, Coyne, and Robinson,
but is. juggling players to make up
the rest of his squad.

“Some of the lines are a little bat-
tered because we have just picked

up new players for the team, and i

because of injuries, so I had to
shuffle players at the last minute,”
Newell said. “What I'm trying to
do is balance each of the lines. It
obviously worked. It just seemed
that Robinson’s line had a little bit
more going for it.” 1

freely.”

The Panther players were think-
ing about the polls and the possibili-
ty of a major bowl bid after
Georgia Tech tied top-ranked N otre
Dame 3-3.

“After today, we have to be con-
sidered one of the best ball clubs

» around,” said Ricky Jackson. “We

have to keep the intensity and play
hard.”

“Hopefully, we’ll move up in the
poll, but the Associated Press

Seniors Say ‘Bye’ To Piﬂ Sfadiumwifh Win

( continued from page ten)
for a lot of guys going in,” said
Mark May. “It may have been why
we didn’t jell early, because the
guys were thinking about it being
the last home game, but you can’t
really say that for sure.”

The same feelings were expressed
by -senior offensive center Russ
Grimm. “I was looking forward to
it. We knew we were going to win
by a lot of points and didn’t want to
let up,” he said. “I just wanted to
have the best game of the season.”

The group of seniors did indeed

have a good day. Defensively,
Green led all players with ll
tackles, Boyarski had eight,

Jackson and Steve Fedell had seven
each. The unit held the Cardinals
to only 191‘ total yards offense,
below the season average coming
into the game of 205.

The seniors in the secondary also
played well in their final game at
home. Strong safety Carlton
Williamson had four tackles and
one interception, cornerback Terrv

White and linebacker Mark
Reichard each had two intercep-
tions.

Offensively, the day once again
belonged to senior quarterback
Rick Trocano. He had 11 comple-
tions in 22 attempts for 231 yards
and 2 touchdowns.

The second moment that made
the game seem trivial was when
Trocano became Pitt’s all-time
leading passer. The game was
momentarily stopped and Trocano
triumphantly jogged to the sidelines

holding the football above his head
to let the cheering crowd see his
achievement. Nobody, not even
Trocano himself could have believ-
ed that this moment would occur
back when the season began. But
when Dan Marino went down to a
knee injury, Trocano stepped right
in and played as if he had never
missed a snap. He now has 3,792
yards passing in his career.

“I was aware of the record,” said
the senior signal-caller. “My bud-

dies kept me posted. It’s a gws ha

feeling, but I couldn’t have done it ‘

without great receivers and great
pass protection.”

So, although Pitt won and Notre
Dame was tied, the thoughts of the
weeks to come were less important
to the 15 starting seniors who
played the last home game in their
careers.

“It affected all of the seniors.
It’as hard to believe this is the last
one,” said Trocano. “It seems like
you'll continue to play and play and
Han mad times will never run out.”

As Julius Dawkins settled under
the punt, the task at hand was ob-
vious. With Pitt trailing Louisville
by a score of 9-0 in the second
quarter, things appeared gloomy.
The Panther offense had looked
stale and Pitt was in dire need of a
lift. Julius Dawkins realized this.

“I had one thing in mind and that
was a long run. Our guys were flat
and needed some momentum and I
wanted to give it to them.”

Dawkins made good on his word.
Receiving the ball at the Panther
49-yard line, Dawkins took it all the
way down to the Louisville 13. The
return set up a David Trout field
goal and the momentum was now
on Pitt's side. Dawkins was quick
to praise his teammates.

“The wall was there. Those guys
really did a heck of a job,” he said.
“A lot of credit has to go to coach
Sherrill. He really worked on the
punt return all week long.”

Not satisfied with one fine
return, Dawkins went into his act
again a few minutes later. With Pitt
leading 10-9 late in the second
quarter, the sophomore wide
receiver took the punt at his own 41
and cut to the near sideline by the
Pitt bench. There to greet him was

_a wall of friendly dark blue shirts.

Dawkins followed his blockers,
then cut against the grain at the
Louisville 35. It looked as if he
would go untouched into the end
zone but a Cardinal player was able
to lunge and trip him up at the 28.
The return set up another Pitt
score.

These two returns were greatly
appreciated by Sherrill, as he prais-
ed Dawkins first before talking
about the game.

Dawkins Gives Pitta Lift With Punt Returns

“Dawkins had a great game. He
helped us out emotionally with that
return and kept us in good field
position all game long.”

Dawkins, a highly sought after
receiver, took over punt return
duties in the West Virginia game.
Before he asserted himself, a
number of people had been tried
with minimal success. Dawkins
showed what he could from the
outset as he returned several punts
for good yardage in that game. Pitt,
after numerous tries, had finally

I found its punt returner.

It was Dawkins who went to
Sherrill and volunteered for the job.

“I returned punts in high school
and since I was not getting too
much playing time at receiver, I felt
I could contribute in other ways.”

As a punt returner, Dawkins has
one rule that he feels very strongly
about and that is to never fair catch
the ball. As Dawkins sees it, every
punt is returnable and fair catching
it is not a part of his game. This,
however, has put him in some
awkward positions as he has been
found to backpeddle in order to
find a wall.

Nevertheless, returning punts
gives Julius Dawkins an opportuni-
ty to show people that he can run
with the ball.

“I want to show the people that I
can run with the ball. If I can’t do
it at receiver, then I want to do it
returning punts.”

A potential starter next season,
Dawkins still -would like to return
punts because as he puts it, “it’s
something I enjoy.” .

In Dawkins the Panthers have a
punt returner that should continue
to electrify crowds for years to
come.

Our Apologies. . .

TO THE READERS:

In the SHOWCASE issue of October 28, 1980, we printed a critique of the
magazine submitted to us by Lee Gutkind, Assistant Director of the Writing Pro-
gram for the University of Pittsburgh. Gutkind’s critique was written at the re-

quest of the SHOWCASE editorial staff.‘

We, at SHOWCASE feel that Gutkind’s critique was a fair and unbiased ‘ A

analysis of the work we are doing and the improvements that need to be made at
the magazine. He supplied us with the honest account that we requested.

Unfortunately, Gutkind wrote his critique with the impression that it would
not go beyond the desks of the SHOWCASE editors, and rightly so, since he was
at no time informed that it would be used for publication. This was, by all means,
a grave error on our part. We ran the critique without securing the permission of
Gutkind, as well as neglecting to properly edit the critique for publication or at-
taching an editors note specifying who Lee Gutkind is.

SHOWCASE published the critique with the hope that it would shed some new
‘light and provide some answers to the problems connected with printing an enter-
tainment magazine. But because of our negligence and unprofessional handling of
the situation, it seems to have created more harm than good. Part of this harm
stems from Mark Collins’ letter in the Nov. 5 issue of The Pitt News. While Col-
lins attacks Gutkind's critique, the fault really lies with SHOWCASE.

At this time, SHOWCASE would like to extend a deep and public apology to
Lee Gutkind. He courteously honored our request which ended up as a disservice
to himself through our mishandling of the situation. We hope that he accepts our
apology and will ‘continue to provide us with much needed comments and

criticisms.

Musical’s Cast: Tasty Frosting On Tasteless Cake

THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM
Music by Robert Waldman

Book and Lyrics by Alfred Uhry
Point Park College Theatre Company

I Pittsburgh Playhouse Theatre Downstairs

By ’].D. KLEINKE

mmeasurable credit belongs to a cast who made a gallant effort at
squeaking out quite an impossible musical.

The Robber Bridegroom, in its more attractive shade, is weak, mundane,
and rather boring. Far beyond its trite lyrics and tiresome cuteness, it
descends the lowest depths of musical comedy, bringing a redundant
bawdiness to the exhausted stage.

In the Playhouse production, its saving grace was the energy and excite-
ment perpetuated by‘the cast, obvioulsy dedicated above and beyond the
call of duty. The plot encompasses four or five tediously stock characters,
tried and tribulated by one Jamie Lockhart, a two-faced social scrooge. ll-
logical inconsistencies of the character erupted as a groping Rick Ferraro
stumbled helplessly through the impossible portrayal.

In the realm of musical comedy, the show reaches a new height in stoop-
ing low. Decapitated heads singing from mobile chests (nicely done, in-
cidentally) and countless sight gags inspired by mentally deficient
characters are uproarious once, funny a second time, and perhaps still, a
triflingly amusing the third. But repetitiveness infected the storyline,
depleting from it any entertaining qualities these comic techniques may
have initiated.

But again, the cast spared the musical its characteristic drabness with in-
spired singing, vivacious dance, and a general enthusiasm that convenient-
ly obscured the countless and unabated loose ends. The production was
fresh and innovative, drawing heavily upon an ingenious application of
pantomime displacing the use of conventional sets. ‘L

The musicians, on stage and in character, were an additional element
that lended an impotent musical some degree of theatrical appeal.
Together, the creative aspects of the production and the desperate en-
thusiasm of the cast, masked and sublimated an incredibly misconceived

The University of Pittsburgh Studio Theatre will present Samuel Beckett's
Waiting For Godot opening Thursday and running through November 22nd.
‘ The classic tragicomedy in the tradition of the highly stylized and abstract
"theatre of the absurd", is an examination of the act of perpetual anticipation,
and its timelessness. The all-male cast is a representative roster of various
types of human beings; and impending doom undercuts the play as we watch
them wait hopelessly "for Godot."

Legend: Art ImitatingLife',
D Pelligrino Has Arrived

A LEGEND IN HIS OWN MIND
Written and Directed by Stephen Pelligrino
Floating Theatre

By WALTER W/ATSON

Steve Pelligrino is an amazingly
creative innovator in the performing
arts. A graduate of the University of
Pittsburgh with a degree in Theatre
Arts, Pelli rino's talent extends beyond

' aciinl‘ gin o the worlds of mime, music,
and dance. His credits include his im-
aginative and colorful ”A Night in
Pittsburgh" and a stage production for
people confined to wheelchairs, as well
a dance program for the blind.

"People think that if you are not
from New York, than you're no good."
Well Pelligrino has been to New York

and has returned to successfully dispel .

the myth.

A Legend In His Own Mind wagga one-
man, non-stop performance by Stephen
Pelligrino as ”the artist trying to survive in
a hostile environment." The structure and
content of this avant-garde theatre piece is
very challenging for the performer, since its
"art imitating life" sensibilities force the per-
former to give as much conviction to the
role as he or she can muster; or lose the bat-
tle in trying.

Pelligrino, a 26-year-old local performer
is intriguing as dancer, actor, and singer in

_ Legend; dressed in a wrap-around cape, a

belt of five or six flashlights pointed
primarily in an upward direction, and a
baggy, Arabian-style pair of glowing pa-
jamas (due to the flashlights). With a stage
area nearly three-quarters the size of a gym-
nast's floor exercise space, an electric piano
with a lamp on it, Pelligrino's seriousness
and concentration made Legend entertain-
ment of the surprisingly good variety.
Control was never a problem for
Pelligrino. I-lis entrance with the cape made
him resemble a giant firefly). Nervous
laughter filled the room for the first five
minutes and turned into sincere laughter as
the audience realized what was being ex-
pressed through the strange self-supported
lighting. Pelligrino let the cape fall to the
floor to expose his baren upper body and
what resembled a swimmer's cap covered

T-¢uuo9e¢ooooec 

with black hair. He created interesting im-
ages with the lighting on his body and the
lamp on the piano. His arms, chest, and

back were seen in an almost surreal fashion '

as the lights attached to his waist made him
appear like a" moving Dali canvas when h _
danced. When he sat at the piano, hej
turned on a lamp that allowed a full view oli
his face and made extraordinarily scary and
spacey’ shadows on the wall directly behind
him. i . I

The songs were often of the pain and

despair that an artist feels when attempting‘

to create ‘and perform in an area where
what is popular and what is good do not

«..

always share the same stage. Pelligrino "

seemingly appeared to allow the audience
into his world in the same way Thurber
presented his sense of humor and irony.

' What made Legend so enjoyable was the
audience feedback; active response that
contributes to or sets the tone of the per-

forrner’s expressions. It is a well-calculated 9

risk Pelligrino takes when he offers mon-
tages of art, life, and the problems that fall
between the two, to audiences unfamiliar
with his work. Legend is a splendid example
of what universal themes like career disap-
pointments, dreams of success, and family
strife in our society can do to bring theatre
and performer closer together. It is only a
shame that performers like Pelligri_no’s
(from Nov. 6 through Nov. 9) go without
being seen or discussed until they are long
gone. ‘

Weekend At PT Starts Spotty, Finishes Sparkling

. BARRE INN/PETROUCKA/ PORTRAITS

Choreographed by Keith Martin/ Michael
Fol<ine/ Patrick Frantz

Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre

Heinz Hall

November 8, 1980

By I.D. KLEINKE

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre brought
local choreographic talent into the spotlight
this weekend; one successful, one other-
wise. Barre Inn The Tavern, choreographed
by the dean of the PBT school, Keith Mar-
tin, was a brilliant idea. Someone‘ really
ought to develop it into a ballet. Working
with a jazzy score and staged in a classically
seedy jazz bar, the ballet is an adaptation
and integration of some of dance’s lighter
moments, including the immortal
Charleston. The highly stylized concept
was well intended, but betrayed by an un-
fortunate mis-emphasis on. that concept,
rather than on the actual dance within.
The numerous effects were clever and in-
ventive, and would not have overwhelmed
the stage had it been sprinkled a little more
generously with steps. Toward the middle,
the effects grew tiresome and the work as a
whole saggéd terribly. Mercifully, the ballet
was salvaged by two superlative perfof-

mances from ballerina Ingrid Fraley ‘and
danseur Patrick Garza.

The second item on the evening's menu,
Petroucka, was the successful antithesis of
the first. The production elements—the
sets, lighting, and costumes were stunning,

but graciously unmonopolistic.

The ballet is a four-scene tragicomedy en-
compassing the rise and fall of the lovable
Russian puppet Petroucka. Keith Martin
danced the part magnificiently. The focus
was delightfully balanced; the supporting

scenes done with an enrapturing excite-
ment. Bringing the captivating and often
breathtaking aspects of Russian folk dance
to the stage, the colorful full—cast montages
flourished with dazzling spectacle,
heightening the overall image of the ballet.

‘The third work, PBT Artistic Director
Patrick Frantz's Portraits provided a
peculiar insight into the theatrical function
of ballet. Seemingly structureless, plotless,
and themeless, the work was a celebration
of classical ballet; a heavy concentration of
the purest ballet in its own context. The
choreography was somewhat conventional,
but varied enough to convey its point. Each
etude was a schematic "portrait"; a series of
characterizations portrayed entirely
through subtly dissimilar approaches to the
individual steps.

This precept can prove harrowing.
Without the indispensable energy de-
manded of each dancer, the ballet could
very well have fallen irreversibly into the
dark recesses of mediocrity.

Luckily, this was not the case. The
dancers escaped this danger with an excited
personability that ran throughout the
ballet. Portraits was danced with a flowing
precision and flavored with the perfect
touch of emotional flair.

Innovative Variations At The Playhouse

L

Pittsburgh Playhouse
October 24, 1980

By SUSAN COLWELL

The Pittsburgh Dance Council opened its
third season Friday night with its Umbrella
Dance Series program at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse, featuring the Pittsburgh Dance
Alloy, the Pittsburgh'Black Theatre Dance
Ensemble, and Ianet Gillespie and Present
Company‘.

The Umbrella Dance Series is designed to
give local modern dance companies and

The Pittsburgh Dance Alloy
. . .stilted and unnatural.

on a professional level. Friday's program

V presented a variety of styles from within the

spectrum encompassed by the term
"modem dance,” ranging from nearly
classical to absolutely modern.

The evening began with Pittsburgh
Dance Alloy performing ”Anemone,” a
smooth, almost classical interpretation of
music by Ravel and Francais. The dancers
began behind a scrim and against a blue
background, giving the image of water to
the audience. Once the, image was set, the
scrim was lifted.

Musical interpretation of this piece was

good, as was the dancing. The main prob-
lem with it and the next, a premier pas de

   
  

deux called "Orthogonals" was that the
dancers never seemed to give completely,
and as result the moves lookd stilted and
unnatural.

This was in direct contrast with The
Pittsburgh Black Theatre Dance Ensemble,
whose movements were flowing and ef-
fortless in each of the three pieces that they
performed. All choreography for PBTDE
was done by Maliki Roberts. I

Their first piece also a premiere, was per-
formed by four female members of the
ensemble to music by Gayle Moran and
Chick Corea& The dancers were always
together, mixing smooth classicism with
modern freedom of movement. The second

number, ”Misquito’s Tweeter,” another
premiere, was performed by the male
ensemble to music by Nina Simone. This
piece was intense, yet the dancing flowed
smoothly.

”Entourage" began with a dramatic
reading that set up the dance as a journey to
Mecca, but it wasn't necessary. The music,
by Weather Report, was interpreted so well
that it, along with the costumes and pro-
gram notes, told the story. Again, there
was the freedom and flow of movement
that was a pleasure to watch.

Ianet Gillespie and Present Company
performed ”Concrete and Diesel," yet
another of the. evening's premiere’s, to

music by Rickie Lee Jones. It was the most
modern piece of the evening.

Dancers wore black tights and an assort-

ment of printed tee. shirts. The dance had
three parts, each with a different mood, set
by music changes and background colors.
Janet Gillespie choreographed the piece,
which was characterized by looselimbs and

moves that were purposely not flowing,
and by a stage set so that more than one
spot on it could be the center of attention.
The dancers were relaxed and smiling, and
the audience loved it.

The program closed with a piece called
”L’Au-to," danced by Pittsburgh Dance

Alloy and choreographed by Susan Gillis, a

Pitt dance instructor. The credits for this
one read like a ”Star Wars” movie, with
listings of visuals and sound design,
photography, synthesized music, and tape
collage. It turned out to be a modern pro-
duction number, complete with costume
change, comedy and audience participa-‘
tion. '

It began with the company trying to’
decide where to go for the evening. They
decided on a racetrack and a car wash, and
the dancing was an amusing and accurate
interpretation of both. Finally the dancers
and members of the other two companies
broke into disco and danced through the
delighted audience. The entire piece was
well designed and executed.

Gary Chryst (above) of the Ioffrey
Ballet, and Kevin McKenzie (below)
of the American Ballet Theatre will
be featured in the Pittsburgh Dance
Council's first Guest Artists Series
production of the season. Together
with numerous other renowned
dancers, the two will highlight "A
Celebration of Dance," a gala mon-
tage of seven works ranging from
classical and modern ballet to
original modern dance pieces.

LStory About A Menage a Trois , g
Roeg’s ‘Bad Timing’: A Filmmaker’s Sensual Obsession

BAD TlMING/ A SENSUAL OBSESSION
Directed by Nicholas Roeg
Written by Yale Udoff

But, as earlier stated, most of the effectiveness of the film comes from
Roeg’s technique. Subtle sounds and off-center action constitute the most
dramatic effects of the film. Every dimensional plane is utilized, as Roeg
makes us acutely conscious of what is going on in the background as well

By THOM PALMER

Nicholas Roeg takes a lot of head-work out of critiquing his new

picture. "Sensual" is the key word of his film; for Roeg has stacked
layer upon layer of texture into Bad Timing to make it as evocative visually
as it is verbally. 

Roeg seems like a film-maker dedicated to attitude, expression and sur-
rounding. It is as if we are locked into the streamlined, interpretive head of
a voyeur-—that voyeur being Roeg—and lead politely, yet not
authoritatively, through observations. I

Dr. Alex Linden (Art Garfunkel) is a psychoanalyst at a Viennese
University who falls in love with Milena (Theresa Russell), a piquantly
beautiful woman who seems to be a professional hedonist. Roeg tells the
story of their love affair and its outcome with all the linear quality of a
patchwork quilt. Yet, this form is quite indicitive of the story's content. It
works well because Roeg turns the affair into a menage a trois; Alex,
Milena and himself. He shies from specifying a point of view, which serves
to leave his film unbiased. -

We can see how Alex views his love—as a woman powerfully misguided
by a weightly pleasure principle. He sees her as a sexual opportunist, biding
her time from bed to bed while he frets and moans about the quality of that
lifestyle. ‘

What Alex fails to see, and Roeg judiciously points out by remaining om-
niscent, is that it is not so much Milena’s zest for sensation that causes pro-
blems in the relationship, it is Alex's inability, probably from uncharted
antecedent causes, to distinguish logical types. When Milena tells him that-
she loves him, we can see that she truly does. Roeg pools our sense into
single, multi-level shots that make us want to reach out to the screen and
touch her lips. It is almost as if Roeg is saying, "This is a sensitive woman
who deserves all the love that she seeks." Unfortunately for Alex, he fails to
see this. He can't bring himself to admit that she is being sincere and the
result is always a quarrel. Alex honestly believes that he is acting out the
saviour, and all the while, he is the degenerating force in the relationship.

Alex's jealousy reaches obsessive proportions. He goes out of his way to
catch up with Milena, only to call her a liar upon finding her. This reduces
the relationship to nothing more than physical communication. Alex acts
as if he cannot relate until he literally and figuratively drops his pants,
whereupon he treats Milena as if he is doing her a favor by providing the
libidinal fix that keeps her alive.

B y subtitling his film A Sensual Obsession, director

It is then Alex's obsessive delusions that create a near tragedy. Milena is V

affected by his inferences, until she comes to view herself as Alex views her.
The result is a massive drug overdose.

Most of the action takes place in dreary Vienna, with the characters as
survivors of this Freudian wasteland. It would be safe to say that Freud is
also a character to be reckoned with in the film. Alex uses a screen-size
photo of the psychoanalyst in one of his lectures; he and Milena visit
Freud's house on their first date together. All the characters are extremely
oral, especially Alex, smoking constantly, and there is a brief scene in the
beginning where a doctor passes him in the hospital and tells Alex, as he
draws deeply on a cigarette, that it will kill him in the end. The possibilities
within Bad Timing tend to make interpretations somewhat over-indulgent,
but they are things that one can't help but notice. Especially striking is
Roeg’s repetitive use of flashback. Every remembered scene of love-making

between Alex and Milena is followed immediately by disturbing emergency A

room footage of the doctors trying to save Milena from her overdose. After
the second or third time, one comes to expect the pattern; the juxtaposition

as the foreground. Not only does Roeg rely on the ability of Garfunkel and

Art Garfunkel in ’Bad Timing’

. . .as evocative visually as it is verbally.

Russell to draw the full meaning from every shot, he uses the space, objects
and people around them as modifiers. Everything serves a purpose, and
that purpose is to create an impression. Roeg has'a knack for bolstering the

feeling of each scene by garnishing them with discreet detail. During a '

quarrel between Alex and Milena on a busy sidewalk at the University of
Vienna, Roeg wants us to understand that they are capsulated in their own
tiny world, and he does this by separating them from the reality around
them. In the moderate close-ups, they are the only things in focus; the peo-
ple moving back and forth behind them are in a drunken blur. Pauses be-
tween their verbal exchanges are filled with music: no street sounds, no
plethora of passing conversations. He creates for them a private world in a
public place, and the intensity of their words is accentuated.

In Bad Timing/A Sensual Obsession, Roeg creates a highly sensitized _

world. Its delicate construction earns it the title of film, something that is

For Sinatra Tour De Force

THE FIRST DEADLY SIN
Directed by Mark Hutton
Screenplay by Mann Rubin

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Frank Sinatra is" a big star. He used to
give a lot of concerts and make a lot of
movies until he either became so bored or
so rich that he gave most of that up. So
what could tempt him out of self-imposed
semi-retirement—a good movie perhaps?
Yes, an awfully good movie called The First
Deadly Sin. g

Sinatra was never known for his
dramatic acting qualities; he is better
remembered for his numerous roles as the-
guy-who-gets-the-girl in several musicals.
We knew that he could sing up a storm
(remember Anchors Away and High Socie-
ty7), dance, and make the girls swoon; but
could he really act? It may have taken
several years to answer this question, but
the response is a definite ”yes." In The First
Deadly Sin, Sinatra gives a cool,

understated performance that perfectly-

meshes with the rest of the film. While you

may not see any manic outbursts of emo-
tions a la Nicholoson and Pacino, Sinatra's
character is so honest and precise that it
doesn't matter—- we don't need that emo-
tionalism to tell us how he's feeling.

The story itself, while hardly original, is‘
still the sort of thing that makes for a good
movie. Sergeant Delaney is a New York Ci-
ty cop who's only a few weeks away form
retirement when his world suddenly starts
crumbling. First, his wife (Faye Dunaway)
becomes ill and must be taken to the

.hospital for an emergency operation. After
the operation, she doesn't seem to be any 

better but the doctors have no idea what's
wrong with her. In the meantime, Delaney
stumbles upon a series of bizarre
murders—the victim's skulls are punctured
by a sharp hammer-like device—which he
suspects is the work of a psycho. Delaney
spends half his time at the hospital and the
other half trying to solve the case. He can't
seem to help his wife in any way, so he uses
the murder case as an outlet for his frustra-
tions. ’

There is an eerie connection between the

psycho and Delaney's wife throughout the

I Canvassing An Area Of Topics InAn Absurd Vein ?'

   

Woody'Allen

characters in cartoon situations.
SIDE EFFECTS

Woody Allen

Random House/149 pgs.
By THOM PALMER

One must look at Woody Allen as an
atom, or at least part of an atom. The red-
haired writer/actor/director sits fetally in
the nucleus while _a cloud of topics orbit
furiously around him. the only incongruity
in this analogy is that there is nothing else
that seems compatible to the man; nothing
to which he can bond.

Allen displays a special class of written
humor that fends off categorization. He
generates physical and metaphorical im-

‘ probabilities so uniquely that his writings,

invoke laughing out loud. It is impossible to
avoid. Part of this is due to Allen's
meticulous timing for the use of glib
understatements, non-sequitors, and ab-
surd similes with occasionally terse
adherence to "the tones of Dostoevski,

- spro,ut

Proust’, Joyce and others.

His third book, Side Effects, is another
scalpel-sharp parade of parodies taking the
form of eulogy, play, journal, short story,
column,’sketch and speech.

It is with lofty literary command and at-
tentiveness to the English language "that sets
the book apart from other works of humor.
It is the art of exaggeration that lets Allen
and bloom. His loathsome
characters surpass those the likes of Fydor
Karamozov or Lady McBeth. His pitiable
ones make Faulkner's Benjy a prince of for-
tune. Whatever aspect a character's per-
sonality takes, Allen amplifies it and turns
it into grossly absurd humor. Their feelings
are misguided and their attitudes are
misshaped. In a piece called "Remember-
ing Needleman," he speaks like the compas-
sionate comrade and historian in light of a
friend's death:

Needleman was not an easily
understood man. His reticence
was mistaken for coldness, but he
was capable of great compassion,
and after witnessing a particularly
horrible mine disaster once, he
could not finish a second helping
of waffles. His silence, too, put

I people off, but he felt speech was
a flawed method of communica-
tion and he preferred to hold even
the most intimate conversations
with signal flags.

The most pleasing part of the book is try-
ing to visualize Allen's words and images in
terms of a physical reality. He manages to

i put strikingly real, moderately believable

characters into almost cartoon like situa-
tions, while still keeping a depth of realism.
From a piece called "Reminisces: People
and Places":

Sheepshead Bay: A leathery-

faced man laughs heartily and
hauls up his crab traps. A giant
crab seizes the man's nose between
his claws. The man is no longer
laughing. His friends pull him
from one side while the crab's
friends pull from the other. It is no

use. The sun sets. They are still at
it. .
The reading is far from light, yet hardly
boring. And that twisting of concept and
reality, done as only Allen can, makes for a
perfect combination, and a new book that
ends much too quickly.

Two Sci-Fi’s That Step
Farther Into The Realistic 4

.CITY COME A-WALKIN’
John Shirley
Dell

By GEORGE SI-IANER

During the recent Sci-Fi boom, there has
been a great emphasis on epic, clean-cut
technological visions.’ This has been par-
ticularly true of the movies that have
caught the public imagination. Relatively
little time has been concentrated on in-
dividuals caught in tight, ugly cir-
cumstances—-circumstances that ‘ frustrate
one’s ability, and leave you cold.

Scavengers takes the old Sci-Fi technique
of choosing a single advancement and ex-
trapolating it out to its logical conclusion.
In this case, the ”advancement" is a method
of allowing people to experience others
perceptions. The catch is that the "donor"
dies in process.

Brian is a man who loses his lover to the
addicts who experiment with this technique
and he is not satisfied to allow the matter to
end. He tries to bring back Kelly-via the

cultist's own technique by using a burned-
out cult member named Tracy.

This book is a personality struggle bet- ‘

ween two unreasonable mentalities and the
person caught in between. The fact that so
many strange cults have come screaming in-
to our midsts makes this story entirely
realistic.

John Shirley specializes in Science Fiction

Gothic. That is, writing that takes the
assumptions of Sci-Fi and combines it with
the sense of the alien and unknowable that
lurks in the best Gothic fiction.
‘ Stu Cole is a club owner in San Francisco
who is disturbed by the encroachments
organized crime is making on the national
computer net (an entirely real concern).
One night, he's approached by a man who,
is the literal personification of the City's
spirit. This man enlists him in an effort to
fight the criminals who threaten the City's
being.

Like Scavengers, City takes a completely
real and chilling concern and treats it in a
speculative manner. This isn't for people
who are looking for simple escapist fare. It
is though, for those people who want to get
into a reality they haven't experienced yet.
And fiction can have no higher ainf than

that.

Hawn's Comedic Finesse Scores In ‘Private Benjamin’ '

PRIVATE BENJAMIN
Directed by Howard Zieff

By WALTER WATSON:

Subtitled narration introduces Judy Ben-
jamin (Goldie Hawn) to the audiences of
"Private Benjamin." That narration tells
viewers that Judy, at eight years old, con-
fided to a friend that all she ever wants out
of life is a husband, a big house, servants,
and money. Ironically, and abruptly, the
last sentence of the narration says

“something to the effect that Judy ”now has
it all." As shocking as it may seem, this
Jewish American Princess seems to have

   

she dreamt of as a child, becomes all the
possible problems a person can have in a
successful modern day farce about a mil-
quetoast in boot camp.

Judy is overly protected by her parents
(Barbara ﬂggie and Sam,W.ana'maker) and
is not given credit for having common
sense. The opening scene shows Judy mar-
rying her second husband (Albert Brooks),
a prominent lawyer. Security is what she
thinks she wants, and has until later in the
evening when her husband dies of a heart
attack while making love to Judy. Prob-
lems? You think you've got problems?
Judy's folks just finished bailing her out of a
six-week marriage to a "schmuck" of a ten-

nis pro, whose sole ambition was to serve
and volley at a local Philadelphia country
club. She gets no respect. At the wedding
reception, a guy comes up to her and says,
"Judy, you could have married me." Judy
retorts, " ‘Live together,’ isn't that what you
mean? There is a difference, you know?"
After the funeral, people start mumbling
outside the widow's bedroom things like,
"She doesn't know what she wants to do."
"Where will she go?" "She's 29 and is
trained to do nothing.” The sobbing Judy,
corrects the lame statements under her
breath: "I'm,28.” If it appears that Private

Benjamin's implication has an aura of V
' Rodney Dangerfield one-liners or is a slop-

py concoction of “Sad Sack" muck that at-
tempts to be funny, ”ATTEN-HUT! Stop
right there, soldier." The film is filled with
the trials and tribulations of one woman,
but when she starts winning ‘private’ bat-
tles, the exaggerations and hopelessness
becomes well-founded. She starts. by
enlisting in the Army under simple-minded
misconceptions ("There’s been a mistake. I
think I'm in the wrong army. I enlisted in
the army with the condominiums."),
decides to stay in the Army after three of
the roughest, (and for audiences, funniest)
weeks of her life. ‘ -
She chooses to stay rather than go home
to her parents. She serves under a hard-
nosed sergeant (Eileen Brennan) and learns

things about herself that she never knew
before. Judy can be strong. Judy can have a
mean streak in her. And when stationed to
duty in Paris, she has graduated to an en-
tirely new and responsible person. Judy is
given the chance to‘ marry a fairly hand-
some French gynecologist (Armand
Assante) who has a big house, a maid, and
francs to boot. In the hardestdecision of
Judy's new life, she mustidecide between
her new independence and what she has

always wanted materially. What she (I

chooses is definitely in her character an
constitutes Judy Benjamin, person, as well
as Judy Benjamin, winner.

The costumes, supporting ‘cast, and loca-
tion footage in France add a ”classiness"
that would leave "Private Benjamin"
dumped with a number of lesser comedies.
The mishaps and victories of Hawn's
character make Judy a smarter, stronger
person; she becomes at once a persona that
attracts almost as much pity and hope as
Charles Chaplin's "Tramp" from over 50
years ago. Goldie Hawn is a very funny
woman, a good actress as well. The
development of her character from a naive
little girl to a decisive, lovely woman in a
comic fashion makes Private Benjamin glide
with grace and finesse, unexpectedly, and
in diametric opposition to the “cruisin’ for a

bruisin’ ” chick audiences think they'll seeQ

for the film's well-executed 110 minutes.

movie. The opening scene, for example, is
divided between Mrs. Delaney’s operation
and the psycho stalking a victim, which
happen simultaneously. As we watch her
abdomen being sliced open and blood pour-
ing everywhere, we also see a man's skull
being crushed as he ‘walks down a street in
another part of the city. A crucifix hangs
beside the operating table a few feet from
Mrs. Delaney; another one hangs just a few
feet from the psycho and his victim on the
outside of a church. Later on, Mrs. Delaney
has a relapse as the killer repeats his ritual.

An important part of The First Deadly

Sin is the atmosphere that is created. Filmed
entirely on location, it has the enormous
advantage of using the grittiness of New
York City as a, backdrop. Cutting, from
scenes of shoppers and Christmas trees at
Macy's to unknowing victims walking
down rainy, dimly lit streets has a sobering
effect. The audience forgets that this is a
movie, for it seems all too real.

. I C
The First Deadly Sin is one of the best

mystery-suspense movies to come around
in a long time. Even if Sinatra doesn't sing
or dance, it's still worth the four dollars to
see a movie as finely made as this one.

PURE PRAIRIE LEAGUE
Syria Mosque
November 7, 1980

By THOM PALMER

Not to discredit the Pitt Program Coun-

' cil,- but the studentry at the University of

Pittsburgh seem to view events conducted
and collated by their peers with a grain of
salt. Hopefully, this feeling will dissipate.
After watching the Program Council's pro-
iluction of Pure Prairie'League, there is no
reason why it shouldn't. '

What blew into Pittsburgh last Friday
night was a very_ high-energy (to use a con-
cert cliche) show, far surpassing the
previous Mosque appearance of Spyro
Gyra. While Spryo Gyra are good musi-
cians, they aren’t particularly good live
entertainers. The same cannot be said,
however, of Pure Prairie League. They
stared as hard at the crowd as we did at
them, and the result was more excitement
than it was exhibition.

They plugged immediately into pleasing
form, opening the show with an ab-
breviated acappela intro of ”Falling In and
Out of Love With'You." Cutting that short
(it immediately and profoundly whetted
our tastes) they broke into an hour and half

\ set of music that teetered between rock and
country rock, while never completely com-
mitting itself in either direction._

League is an interesting one. Whether one
likes their style of music or not, it is almost
impossible not to get involved. Feeling their

create an invading rhythm that sweeps

different stages of the show, but it is always I

The scheme is simple and it's being hailed as the experience of the future.

Problem—-Why should artists tour, burning themselves out on a ninety
city trek of the nations hockey rinks? After all, the performances
deteriorate after a certain point within the tour and there's always the
"what-if-your-shows-don’t-sell-out." It can happen to the biggest. Witness
Queen at the Civic Arena this summer. They had the number one LP in the
nation and didn't fill more than half the place. For the artists it can be really
frustrating to play to a half filled, less than enthusiastic crowd. You don't
give your best. But the artist has to tour to geirexposure, to sell his product.

Solution—What if we have the performer do one show in a central loca-
tion and beam it regionally to the area concert halls via closed circuit TV.
In the halls themselves we can outfit the place with concert sized sound
systems and charge concert ticket prices. Our artist can increase his profits
ﬁll exponentionally and assume very little risk. He won't get burned out that
quickly. Massive tours can be eliminated. Just play New York, Atlanta,
Chicago, and Los Angeles and you've got the whole country covered. The
artist will still get the exposure needed to sell albums and work a whole lot .

, On Oct. 31 the Greatful Dead attempted this closed circuit method. Most
major markets on the east coast received the‘ Dead, live in concert, direct
from Radio City Music Hall in N.Y.C. Locally, the Dead were seen at the

To me, live-concerts have always resulted in a communication chain bet- -
ween the artist and the audience. The artist acts, we respond, and they
shape their next move to our response. The clinical air of a massive closed
circuit.TV screen eliminated this special aspect of a live performance. The
Dead concert atmospherevwas more akin to a movie than rock and roll.

Actually, the technology was the biggest hinderance. Everyone watches
a concert differently. Through the closed circuit TV your concert view-
- point was that of the camera directors. This lead to a "Midnight Special” ef-

fect. Secondly, the actual camera work [was often poor. The picture was
frequently out of focus and a_blurred image is as good as no image at all.
The concert sound system was truly excellent, however. It was in true
:stereo, crystal clear and better than most live performances.

/ I'd still like to see the Dead live someday. Closed circuit rock is very
similar to listening to your favorite band live over the radio with some
oversized images. Not exactly worth the seven dollar ticket prices.

The same night Utopia attempted the same marketing technique by a dif-
ferent method. Although Utopia has a new album‘ out, the group's in-
dividual members are too busy with solo projects to actually tour the coun-
try in support of this LP. To keep Utopia's name in the public eye, they
played a concert in N .Y.C. and had it beamed to 60 radio stations around
the country. WDVE carried Utopia locally. This concert was promoted as

. any concert in the area would be, as seen by the local campaign. Although
Utopia fans were the happiest since it allowed them to get a reasonable tape
of their faves, whether this action achieved it's intended purpose remains to

Imagine, 1985, as 17,000 rock fans trudge their way down to the Civic

it to us.

The show reached a full head of steam
when The League broke into ”I'll Be
Damned," an audience participation
number. It established a shift in perfor-
mance, where the audience felt that they
had as much a part of the show as the musi-
cians on stage. Before the pleasure of the
crowd's vocality wore off, The League did
"Two-Lane Highway," a pumping number

that fell just short of being the best part of
the evening.

While the entire show was fast and tight,
there was one moment that stood out; one
obvious moment for which almost
everyone was waiting. Then, it started. It
took no longer than a few seconds for the
entire Mosque audience to be on their feet,
and the guitar-picked intro to “Amie" was

lost in the swell of crowd noise. It may be a -

Pure Prairie League trademark, but that
night it was the crowd's. The spinning mir-
ror ball above center stage sprayed its
motes of light around the hall as The
League let us do the chorus on our own.
Even in the heat, smoke, pounding, stomp-
ing and clapping of the Mosque, the effect
was chilling.

Everything, however, does not work out
as well as planned. The prelude to Pure
Prairie League was an excruciatingly unfun-
ny stand-up. comic named Alex Cole. It
seemed that Cole was attempting to gear his
"humor" toward the predominantly college
audience, yet there was someting about the.
man that induced gagging. He wasn't fun-
ny, and, even after concerted efforts, was
as easy to warm to as a pile of compost.
Cole not only struck out; he was also
beaned with the ball, spiked by the catcher
and force-fed the rosin bag by the pitcher.
Too bad that a good evening got off to such
a rough start. -

hardcore of each group would say it was an
excellent night of Rock and Roll.

Michael Schenker, former lead guitarist
for Scorpions and UFO, has enlisted some
talented musicians including Cozy Powell
on drums (former member of Rainbow) and

' formed the Michael Schenker Group. A

very good set included a heapin' helpin’ of,

cuts from the group's debut album. Such
cuts as "Armed and Ready," "Cry for the
Nation," and ”Lost Horizons" came from
the record, and "Natural Thing", a ‘UFO
tune, made up the group's first Pittsburgh

'~ appearance. Many of the people in the au-

dience who had come to see Molly Hatchet
were on their feet by the time Michael
Schenker Group left the stage.~

Molly Hatchet knows what their fans like
and the fans got just what they wanted.
From the first notes of the opening tune
"Bounty Hunter" the pace was set. The sex-
tet ripped through a set with a good mix of
old and new songs from their three albums.
Such cuts as ”Gator Country," "Good
Rockin’," and "Dreams I'll Never See" had
much of the audience singing along. New
tunes such as "Sailor," "Double Talker,"
and "Penthouse Pauper" showed the crowd
a side of the group not present in the earlier

records. The very vocal audience brought '

Hatchet out for three encores, "Beatin the
Odds," "Crossroads," and the standard
"Boogie No More".

It seemed to the people in the area of my
seat that Jimmy Farrar's voice was lost in
the mix. The problem could have been
caused by poor seat location or technical
problems. This being the only flaw, I'd say
it was a very good concert and well worth
the admission price.

Ponty, Coryell: Students Of The Classics Graduate.

JEAN-LUC PONTY/LARRY CORYELL
Stanley Theatre
October 25, 1980

By WALTER WATSON

The Jean-Luc Ponty/ Larry Coryell show
was billed as a night of jazz-rock fusion.
That it was, yet the prevailing motifs
seemed to tilt in favor of classical and neo-
classical stylings in improvisation and in
composition. By no means was the concert
disappointing; rather, the show was a well-

executed production full of delightful sur- O

prises.

Larry Coryell, the guitarist remembered
for the fusion bands Eleventh House and
Coryell-Mouzon during the early to
mid-'70’s, gave the Stanley crowd hand-
clapping country/ folk numbers during the
early part of his 55 minute set. He was in-
deed a one-man band, playing lilting
melodies and choppy chords that filled the

T hazy space above the stage and above the

crowd with beautiful and sensitive nuances
that grabbed the audience attention. That
attention was maintained during the entire
set.) -
His choice of material was eclectic, full of

contrasting musical statements, unified by a
high level of technical proficiency and a
very obvious understanding of the in-
dividual sensibilities of each composition.
From Ravel's "Bolero," to Chick ‘Corea's
"Spain," to his own compositions, Coryell
dug in to get the most clarity and depth
from every chord and every note.

By the time Coryell reached for his least
used instrument, the electric guitar, there
were no doubts of his ability to play the in-
strument with the energy of a 5-year-old or
the experience of an 80-year-old (Coryell is
in his early 40's). For a finale, Coryell whip-
ped out spontaneous rock and roll stan-
dards, with brilliance in chord and key
changes that brought him out of his seat as
fast as the crowd that gave him a well-
deserved standing ovation.

Jean-Luc Ponty, jazz-rock's premier elec-
tric violinist, proved how deceptive titles
can be. As composer, orchestrator, and
then musician, Ponty revealed on this
Saturday night what has been too well con-
cealed by commercial packaging and music
critics. He is first and foremost a student of
classical composers. The influences of
Debussy, Chopin, and Ravel are heard in

many phrasings of his instrument, and‘

through several of his own musical cre-
ations. '

Of course, the structure followed by Pon-
ty, in many cases, assimilates jazz with con-
trapuntal ensemble arrangements and spon-
taneity and improvisation, yet the
discipline involved in his music often lends
itself to the look of a chamber music ensem-
ble. With an etheral stage setting of a pro-
jected oak tree as a spacy backdrop, and
unusual straw props that resembled strange
forms of life mysterious to this planet, all

was ready for the tremendous and over;

powering Cosmic Messenger.

Ponty's new band gave him the support
that would be hard to expect in lieu of the
musicians that departed nearly a year ago,
after the recording and tour of last year's
album, A’ Taste For Passion. The departed
were: Allan Zavod, keyboards; Ralphe
Armstrong, bass; and Casey Scheurell,
drums. The only returning member to the
band was guitarist Joaquin Lievano. ,The
new crew had all the strength and musician-
ship for which a band leader could ask.
Throughout the night, keyboardist Chris
Rhine (formerly of Genesis), bassist Randy
Jackson (formerly of Billy Cobham and
most recently, Narada Michael Walden),

and drummer Rayford Griffin (who is mak-

ing his first major tour ever) showed why'

Ponty had chosen them to round out the
group.

Ponty played five new songs from his-

latest release, Civilized Evil and touched the
audience with many different moods and

images on violin and keyboard. During his -

digital-delay solo entitlted "No Strings At-
tached,” Ponty rode many riffs to their 
solute heights, and created unique or-
chestral auras of sound that drew the
crowd's applause as he and his band did
many times. He played tunes from earlier
albums, including "Beach Girl,” "Mirage,"
and "Sunset Drive."

The show had two encores, the first of
which was a high-speed chase entitled
"Egocentric Molecules." With Ponty,
Iackson, Lievano, and Griffin playing with
fierce intensity on their solos and perceptive
control of the material, no one could ask
for more. But everyone did, entreating Pon-
ty and Coryell to join the band on stage for
a handclapping, foot-stomping rout of
"New Country" that spotlighted Rhine's
piano playing and left the crowd throughly
satisfied on cerebral and visceral levels.

Something about the Babys keeps

' These guys sure work hard,
though. They try their darnedest to

They're like M&M's: each one’s a dif-

Edge could be described as power
pop with an immature_edge to it.
Nonetheless, this release is probably
their best effort to date. At least
they're getting better. . . '

Mentionable cuts include ’’Turn

"Darker Side of Town," "Rock 'n

Maybe I'm being a little harsh with
