"Search lorAgnew's Successor Continues
GOP Leaders Forward

  Legislators React
to Agnew
Resignation

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Senators and Congressmen re-
presenting Pittsburgh gave mixed
reactions yesterday to the resigna-
tion of’ Vice-President Spiro T.
Agnew.

Most representatives are now

—__deeply concerned with the question

of who Agnew’s successor will be.
' All who commented on the issue
believed President Nixon should

not choose his close friend, former

Texas_ Governor John Connally.’

.They reacted favorably to the

names of former Pennsylvania
governor William Scranton and
recently retired Secretary of State
William Rodgers.

Congressman Bill Moorhead of
Shadyside reacted, “There had
been some tale on Capitol Hill
about the Vice-President resigning,
but I think that when it broke-
everyone was surprised.‘

“You certainly have to feel sorry
when a person so high falls so low.

I But he-probably brought it all on

himself.

“This will divert some attention
from the trouble Nixon and his
aides have been getting into, but
the real question now is who the
President will nominate,” Moor-
head said.

Congressman John Dent, of
Greensburg was also startled at the
Agnew resignation. “I was not
only surprised. but shaken after all
his protestations of innocence, and
then for it all to fold up." 7

Dent was irritated that Agnew,
as Vice-President. was able to plea

‘bargain and come up "with a
relatively small penalty. /

“I mean when” an ordinary
citizen goes to jail for five or 10

. years and then a politician gets

. the know.

only a small fine for something like
this. This is not good for America.

“Now the American people have
sympathy for Agnew," Derrt
added. “But now that -the ordeal is
over and he is still" protesting his
innocence to all but one of the
charges, I have lost my admiration
for ‘him. '

‘‘If I do something wrong, as a
congressman, /1 should have no
more rights than aibricklayer, a
carpenter, or a ditchidigger in the"
face of law itself,” Dent said.

Congressman Joseph Gaydos of
McKeesport said that in terms of'a
serious .problem ‘now being solved,
the resignation will have a positive
effect on the Nixon administration.

“This has proved that justice will
prevail and now the President must
reinstitute himself by making a.
good appointment."

Gaydos didn’t think Nixon would
select aivman “like a Rockefeller”
who might be a presidential
in 1976. He cited

preference for Pennsylvania Sena-’
tor Hugh Scott. ”

Scott’s only reaction. to the
Agnew resignation was: ‘-‘I

recognize his courage and dedica- .

tion to his country in making the
decision.” . . .

Gaydos , commented }on Senator.
Scott. “I think he is one who is in
He probably has no"
presidential aspirations and he
would do very well in that capacity
(as vice-president).”

H. John Heinz. republican of
Fox Chapel, disagreed that Presi-
dent Nixon should choose someone

.i>'

who does not have presidential
aspirations.

_ “I think that anyone who wants
to‘ restrict the choice of the
vice-president on any grounds
except. his qualiﬁcations for the

office is advocating an unreasonlp

able and unattenable limitation,”

Discrimination in the member-

an issue introduced at a Trustees-

by Bill Kilson, chairmanof the

EDITOR I

“Carl and I have been able to
establish that the Watergate
conspirators Howard HUnt and
Gordon Liddy had nothing to do
with the sinking of the Lusitania in
World War I. But that's about
all.” -

On the anniversary of what he
referred to as the “seminal story of
Watergate."Bob Woodward of the
Washington Post retraced _ the
intricate steps which led him and
his colleague. Carl Bernstein to the
disclosure of the Watergate Affair.

“The Watergate is not an isolated
incident but a part of a massive
campaign of sabatoge and espion-
age conducted by the White House
and the Committee to Re-elect.”

Woodward. speaking to a crowd in
the Union told tales of late-night

telephone conversations with John-
Mitchell. long hours of pouring
over budgets and ‘moments of
self-doubt. '

“Denials when they started
coming from Mr." Ziegler himself
were intimidating. Herepyou have
the President’s chief spokesman
standing before you with his patent
leather hair shouting. ‘YOU are
lying. You are not telling’ the
truth.‘ That continual denial, the
notion that the spokesman for the
leader of the free world is saying
you lied makes you stop and
think." '

Woodward explained that much of
his work involved developing
contacts. ta_lking with secretaries,
and finding people who were upset
that something was amiss and were
willing to talk. He spent much of
his time analysing the information

tions.for the Trustees. Kilson
elaborated on _the difficulties and
charges which have been directed
at the BAS and black students at
Pitt in_ recent months. i '

“It is being said that the Black
Action Society discriminates be-
cause it excludes white students
from voting and office holding

privileges within the organiza-

tion,” Kilson told the audience.
“If we are found to be guilty of
discrimination, -that would dis-

‘qualify us for recognition by SG as

a student organization, and for
access to student activities’ funds
for programming.” '

Kilson’ maintained that such a.

people in

‘I

charge would prevent
an oppressed condition" from
organizing around the circum-
stances of their oppression. »He
emphasized that the “discrimina-
tory" label disregards a social

reality which holds that white"

students have an availability of
funds, activities, and modes of
expression differing from that of

‘blacks.

“Our programming is open to all
members of the University com-
munity," Kilson said. “The label
of ‘discrimination’ implies that we
seek to minimize our contact ‘with
white ' students and people in
general. On the contrary, we seek
to channel black students into all
accessible levels of University
functioning." _

Kilson discounted the notion that
the University has no obligation to
provide programming of interest to
black "students now that the BAS
exists. He called for the scheduling

Marshall noted SGS actions

direction and movement of the

“It is possible,” he said, ,“for

“The Administration is receptive

“Student input in any decisions
seems assured.” He suggested a
plan that could be considered as a
potential funding mechanism: the
levying of a Union fee that would
help finance construction of a new

Kaufman J proposed hiring a

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

Two U.S. State Department
spokesmen acknowledged last
night the Nixon Administration is
presently engaged in a critical
effort to enhance U.S. - - Soviet
relations and ease the nation’s
international trade restrictions.

Appearing before a Student Union
audience, William Barraclough and
James Wilkinson indicated both
aims intertwine so_progress in one
area could be contingent upon the
success in the other.

According to Barraclough, the
Administration’s central concern is
the fate of the Trade Reform Act of
1973, which has already been
submitted to Congress‘ for its
approval. The bill contains the
vital mandate of authority which
The White House needs to bargain
effectively at the ministerial trade
meetings currently underway in
Tokyo.

The Act, which could be called for
a Senate vote as early as October
20. has encountered strong resis-
tance from Senator Henry Jackson,
who has attached a rider to the bill
known as the Jackson-Vanik
amendment. It prohibits the
relaxation of any trade restraints
with the Soviet Union‘ until the

\

USSR revises its policy regardin '

Jewish emigration and the treat-
ment of dissidents.

“We must be able to implement
what we negotiate," said Barra-
clough. “What we are referring to
is the‘ possible settlement of
lend-lease items with the Soviets
and the extension of “most-favored
nation" trade status to the USSR.
This would provide’ us with a
non-discriminatory trade policy
towards the Russians. allowing us
to treat them the same way we treat
everyone else."

The trade bill could sizeably
expand the volume of trade
between the United States and the
Soviet Union. Last year, the U.S.
exported $1.3 billion worth of
goods to the USSR, while importing
$200 million worth of Russian
products. The Administration
believes the Soviets need to import
equipment and technology if their
economy is to progress beyond its
present stage.

“Trade must stand on its own
merits,” Barraclough said. “If it is
good business, our government will
support it. The Soviet Union has
enormous reserves of liquid natural
gas and . oil which is deﬁnitely
importable in the West. We have
the grain and manufactured goods
which the Russians want.”

. Both Barraclough and Wilkinson

feel the USSR has not altered its
ideology to any signiﬁcant extent.

Eosed Trodelimits Sought  

“Objectively, we realize the need
to make certain adjustments on a
state-to-state level; subjectively,
we realize the class struggle goes
on. We're playing down the
dogmatic. doctrinal struggle." said
Wilkinson.

One of the propositions advanced
by Wilkinson maintained the trend
towards economic collaboration is
not irreversible. He said, the
improvement in trade relations was
precipitated‘ by specific develop-
ments in the’ political sphere.

Wilkinson ‘singled out" the Sov-
iets’ achievement of nuclear parity,

the USSR-Red China rift, and the
emergence of a multi-polar world in

the presence of Japan and West
Germany.

Both men agreed the outbreak of
the Middle East war jeopardizes
the spirit of detente between the
East and West which has nurtured
current trade hopes. Already, each

camp has accused the other of.

re-supplying the combatants with
more arms. and the atmosphere of
co-operation is quickly dispersing.
“Economic policies are, at best,
short-term ones,” Barraclough
cautioned. “We cannot predict the
future. You can have some general
economic principles that guide you
in foreign policy. And there, the
U.S. has had great consistency.”

Exclusive Pitt News Interview

BY RITA vIToLo
The following is a Pitt News

interview granted _yesterday with ,

the press attache of the Egyptian
Mission in New York City.

Question: In a'wire service report
received this afternoon, the Israelis
claim to have recaptured all the
ground which they held in the

__ Golan Heights after 1967 cease-
‘ ' fire, and reportedly

have sent
commando raids -across the Suez.
In view of these facts, Israel is

‘claiming the offensive in the battle.

Answer: That is not true. I would
not believe that Israel has any
claim to the offensive at all. As far
as I know that is a big lie. As for
the situation in the Golan Heights,
that is Syria’s problem. I am afraid
you will have to ask Syria. _

Q: What then, do you feel is the

possible role of the Palestinian .

guerilla factions? Is there any
chance of them openly aligning
with your cause?

A: I am sorry, I have no

 information of this kind available. I

have nothing from Cairo.

‘Q: If Israel should succeed in
holding the occupied territories
that she gained as a result of the
1967 war, under what conditions
would Egypt be willing to accept a
cease-fire?

A: You refer to them as occupied
territories; they are not Israeli
territories, they are Egyptian

White House' sources said
Thursday that Nixon hopes to
nominate a successor to Agnew
within the next few days, possibly
by the end of the week. He called
on the state leaders and Republican
members of Congress to aid in the
selection process by submitting
names. ‘

V Agnew resigned office Wednes-
day after pleading no contest to one
count of income tax evasion.

As expected, strong support was
voiced for Reagan, Rockefeller and

Reagan has said he has given no

say he thought Nixon should pick a
strong vice-president and not just

. nominations:

someone who would “warm the 

chair.” .  _

In reaction to the Agnew resignation, it appears the American people
.o Cjwill have another mystery to think about for some time to come.
A I As in the Watergate scandal, the ITT scandal, and in JFK’s

about the Agnew case has been covered up in what the liberals and

more serious charges in, a plea bargain where the vice-president
resigned and pleaded “no contest” to a single minor charge.
- Experts have said they would rather not have gone through a long

 legal, political and constitutional struggle which could have ensued if

 the Justice Department had held their ground and indicted Agnew.
These experts claim such a conflict would injure the “dignity and

I J. integrity” of the Office of Vice-President and other high offices in the

land. This, they say, would have an ill effect on the American people.

, This assumption is incorrect. The last few months have shown us the
‘tragedy which can result from cover-ups and unresolved questions.

' , The truth, in this case as in all cases, is the best course of action.

I _t '. Twice in the past the University made a commitement to the UFW and

contacted the University and were put in touch with Thomas Albert, of
.Szabo Foods. Albert assured the farmworkers that he would contact

The proposed referendum, aside from being time comsuming and ‘

'-expensive, isundemocratica and unnecessary. The referendum will
-‘allow 3,000 students to make a policy decision on a social issue of

 ,. ‘national improtance for a university of 32,000 students.

" The argument in favor of this referendum is that only the dorm
students in the Towers’ cafeteria will be effected by thereferendum

I J  and therefore, democratically speaking, only they sould have a voice in
‘ . the decision. «

_ This is not the case. Anyone eating in dining facilities other than the

‘week will boycott lettuce and grapes in the Faculty Club. This is the
first step in the right direction, but by itself it is largely ineffective.

are frequented by staff, faculty and students, both-commuter and
off-campus.

. The referendum will in tact poll the 3,000 people eating the largest
quantity of lettuce. It will provide no means of expression for the other
P 29,000. sometime lettuce-eaters. '

Before launching an expensive, time-consuming survey which may be
unrepresentative, the University should ask itself whether there is any
opposition to the boycott.

It would appear/there is not. Letters have appeared in this paper and
elsewhere in support of the boycott, and there have been ‘no rebuttals.

The boycott has the official and unofficial support of many
representative student organizations and 2,000 students and faculty of
the University have signed petitions calling on the ‘University
administration to abide by their previous decision to boycott lettuce
and grapes.

-The student referendum now being proposed is unfair; any
referendum which would be democratic would require great
expenditures of money and energy. The University already has a clear
picture of the sentiment on campus toward the farmworkers. It is tirrie
that they stop dragging their heels and make the simple administrative

decision to abide by the wishes of the university community and
support" the struggle of the farmworkers. ‘

Sour Grapes  

Open letter to the Chancellor and to
concerned UFW supporters:

It is about time for the bickering
and rhetoric to come to an end. To
a person, who has beentwatching
the events of the last several
weeks, what has gone on is
unbelievable. Maybe a short

- personal appraisal may be helpful.

As we see it the administration
has acted irresponsibly not only in
regardshto broken past promises,
but also in relation to present
attempts by the UFW support
group to communicate with fhe
administration. There is no
question in my mind- that the
administration has been acting in
poor faith. I Regardless of the
excuses once ’a high public official
makes a commitment, it should be
carried out to thebestlof his ability.

This has not been done in the case
of keeping scab lettuce off campus.
We need ‘not go into details, but
what we’d like to say is that the
injustices of the past can be
cleansed by the sincerity‘ of the
present.

It totally amazes me as a
politician that an administration

that must present itself to public.

scrutiny for its very existence
would act in‘ the manner that we
have seen this administration act.
How does this administration
expect government officials . to
listen to their pleas, if they will not
even attempt to be fair or even
make an effort to listen to the pleas
of its students.

The entire blame must not rest
solely with the administration for

_the duration of this so called

“struggle”. Just because you
know your causes its right does not
give you victory. Pointing out that
the administration has been acting
in bad faith ‘is great, but when
confronting men like Posvar and
Dutton let us assure you rhetoric
will get you no where. They are, as
we have noticed, coy and evasive
politicians. This is notmeant as an
attack on either man, but as an
appraisal of their public image ‘as
we see it. Wesuggest to allwho
supportthe UFW cause to come to
grips with the situation as it exists.

What is needed-is some solid

face to face communication without 2

the rhetoric and name calling. I
suggest that the chancellor, and
only the chancellor, sit down and
discuss with one representative of
the UFW support group, what is
happening now and what is going
to happen in the‘ immediate future
and why. Some goodxsuggestions
have been advanced by "the
administration for example a

should sit down and discuss the
method and guidelines for such a
vote in order to prevent ‘any
confusion in the future to the
validity of this referendum. This I
believe to be the most sensible

I course.

I urge all parties to stop the
battle and to sit down without
emotional mudslinging and to
settle this problem once and for all.

The administration has in the
past acted in bad faith it is
inconceivable to ‘me that they
should continuepsuch action. If the
administration does —not begin
acting in good faith, we will have
no choice to go directly to the
peoplewho control the furture of

Before any action '
I should be taken all parties involved

will listen to reason and justice.

Gentilcore
Editor:
Recently, there have been
several articles concerning the

grievances filed against the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh by Cathleen
Gentilcore. And I would like to
relate a conversation about the case
which reflects a rather undesirable
feature of the method in which the
grievance procedure is imple-
mented in the School of Education
and perhaps in the university as a
whole. .

As it happened, I was "waiting for

‘ a bus in front of Hillman the other

day and standing a good distance
away were Virgil Cantini and Prof.
Crary (head of the dept. in which
Gentilcore is a student) arguing
with studied impropriety (i.e.,
“loudly”) about the grievance ﬁled
by Gentilcore. Now,‘ it would"be
pointless to report the conversation
in toto since there are only parts

which, I suggest, clearly effect all‘

students" of the university. who

might decide, to take issue with
- some universitypolicy. So, I shall

confine.myself to a few points of
general concern.

The first part of the conversation
that I wish to report manifests a
complete lack of candor in handling
a students personal records and‘ an‘
utter disregard for their confiden-
tiality.‘ Briefly, the conversation
Mr.
Cantini, _in response to a question
about the kind of evidence he

‘would produce against Gentilcore,

proceeded to summon her personal
records (to which, one may infer,
he now has access) presumably
because he considers an ad
hominem argument “evidence.-”

In short, he said she was, “a
troublemaker, ’ ’ “incompetent, ’ ’

“inconsistent,” “a product of a

broken home,” “mixed up,” and

then he proceeded to give other
details from’ her personal files.
Mr. Cantini continually main-

tained that if it were just a question ,

of a grade, he would give it to her
in order to “get her off our backs"
as he put it. But, of course, such a
statement implies that when it is
just a question of a grade, that
grade is given for the sole purpose
of silencing’ a dissident‘ voice.

Surely, this is the worst sort offs;

appeasement because it completely
dismisses the possiblity of a
legitimate complaint which might

require corrective action by the-

university. Furthermore, Cantini
said, “I know these people--you
guys all back off-they come with a
lawyer and everybody gets

scared.” Well, this isn't the sort of ‘

remark that inspires confidence in
the university administration on
behalf of Mexican Americans,

Blacks, and Women (for who else ‘

can» be “the. ubiquitous “these
people"’Lr'.7).'I But what I found most
frightening about Cantini’s Vitu-
peration was that it so clearly
expressed the view that there are
no real grievances because there
are no issues but only trouble-
makers.

The last comment I shall recount
illustrates the attitude of a
departmental chairmen toward
witnesses. When Mr.,Cantini was
confronted by the fact that a certain
professor and others may corro-
borate /part of Gentilcore’s testi-
mony he replies (rather viciously),
“That woman (the professor)! She
should have been thrown out of. the
university, not just banished to the
‘X department. Why do you think I
got rid of her." , Evidently, the
reason Cantini “got rid of her” was
that she, as well as other students,
would “lie for” Gentilcore. I am
happy to say that the logic of
Cantini’s argument excapes me
now, as it ‘did then. '

Woodward Speaks Student Di recto

(Continued from Page 1)

‘he obtained from these sources,

sorting it out and trying to draw
connections.

Woodward had words of condem-
nation for the press, which he feels
does too little of the type of
investigative reporting which re-
sulted in the disclosure of the
Watergate Affair.

Referring to an “obscene affec-
tion with the official version,” he
likened many reporters to “fancy
stenographers.”

“Despite the orgy of congratu-
lation which followed Watergate,
Watergate really showed that the
press didn'tdo i_ts job."

Woodward cited. a Columbia
Journalism Review study which
showed that there are 2.000

President's War Powers

reporters in Washington D.C.. Of
those 2,000, 11 did stories on
Watergate.

“Watergate should have demon- A

strated that there should have been
more of the police reporting,
tracking down‘ and checking on
everyone in any organization to get
the story. But that is not
happening, unfortunately.” i
For Woodward Watergate and its
moral are not over.
“Watergate andthe untangling of
it is a grand and difficult job. It
requires alot of caution and no
premature judgements. All of the
evidence is not yet in. It is in a
sense going to be a painful process.
No one should capitalize on it or
rejoice in it for in .a sense it is an
embarrassemnt to everyone‘ who
lives in this country.”

WASHINGTON AP  The
Senate has passed a bill that would
limit to 60 days the use of U.S.
troops in combat without congres-
sional ‘approval, -

The 75-20 vote sent the bill to the
House, _ where ﬁnal action is
expected within a few days.

President Nixon has indicated he
would veto any war powers bill he
considers an infringement of his
constitutional powers as comman-
der-in-chief of the armed forces. ,

The bill would require a
president to report\ to Congress

U.S. armed forces into hostilities,
or situations risking hostilities.
A president would be required to

- withdraw the troops from combat

approve their continued use. " A
30-day extension would be allowed
if a president certifies “unavoid-
able military necessity” for pro-
tecting the safety of ‘U15. forces

He founded the order in
1858 and his aim was to create
an_order of priests who would

they arose in each era, each

would be modern men.

Part of the success of this
order,he believed,would lie in
the fact that each man would
, be himself, contributing his

own individual talents in his
own way for the total good.

said, ”cannot be too great

In a country so fascinated with its
frontier land and the “old West,”
it’s somewhat expected to try to
bring that romanticism [real or
imagined] to the “new west.”

And since the horse. has been
replaced‘ by the internal combus-
tion engine, the new romanticists

‘have taken on a new symbol for the

spirit. independence and drive of
The West: the motorcycle.‘ There"
have been many motorcycle ﬂicks,
beginning with The Wild One and
generally going down hill from
there.'but none seemed to catch the

spirit wanted by youth like Easy_

Rider. It wasn’t that great a flick,
cheaply made and grossly overdone
at times, but it was a startling
success that spewed forth a spate
of other cheaply made. grossly
overdone movies. '
1 Well, the tide h'asn’t abated yet,
and there’s yet another motorcycle

ﬂick, a bit glossier than some but.

A JAM-PACKED MOIJNTAINEER, FIELD will greet the Panthers
tomorrow as they do battle with West Virginia." Tony Dorsett and
Danny Buggs, the two big threats in the game, are both expected to be

    Almost
  Heaven...
  Almost  

, BY BART MACK
ASSOCIATE sponrs EDI'_I‘0R

Coach Johnny Majors certainly has concentrated on the psychological
factors in prepping the Panthers for tomorrow’s game in Morgantown.
And in psyching up his squad, Majors’ attention has been focused on
the star of the West Virginia team, Danny Buggs.

There are signs posted all over the Pitt locker room calling for the
Panthers to _“smash the buggs,” “de-bugg the Mounties,” etc. At

 

‘ practice, the cry of “Buggs, Buggs, Buggs...” is constantly heard. In

yesterday’s session, the Pitt coaches sported “Beat West. Virginia”
jerseys. »
To top that, each player carried with him a flyswatter; as the defense
drilled against the JV offense, one unfortunate player had to_ play the
role of Danny Buggs. One each play that “Buggs” received the ball
and was tackled, the defensive squad would descend upon him with
their ﬂyswatters. You can guess what happens after that.
So Majors and his squad had their fun and should be. mentally

prepared for one of the oldest rivalries going. Don’t think West’

Virginia won’t be. _
Subbing for Majors at the last Monday session in the Student Union,

, Frosh Coach Bob Leahy stated that even though the Mounties lost their

last game, in the ﬁnal minutes of the contest the homecoming crowd,
realizing their team defeated, chanted “Beat Pitt, Beat Pitt...” '

Just as Tony Dorsett is considered the main threat of the Pitt,
offense, Buggs means the same to the Mounties. After Kerry Marbury:
left Morgantown for the Canadian Football League, although he had-
one year of NCAA eligibility remaining, it looked like a dismal year
ahead for West Virginia. Enter Danny Buggs. _ .

So as the two teams enter tomorrow’s clash, the Mounties have the
better record but the Panthers have played the better teams. Pitt is
depending on a healthy Tony Dorsett and the Mountaineers on a 100%
Danny Buggs. 'Dorsett’s real playing status will not be divulged before
game time and Buggs sat out last week’s loss to Indiana with a
“charley horse.” ' ’

WVU Coach Bobby ‘Bowden said this of the game, “...you can throw -
out - records, because this Pitt-West Virginia rivalry is always a good
contest.” , ’

Good God, what then are you supposed to go by when it comes to
making a prediction? Surely the record books are intact in Majors’ and
Bowden’s respective offices and their coaching staffs have gone
through them with a fine tooth comb. Can the psychological factor
make that much of a difference? . - I

Yes, it does, but with some stipulations attached. LI believe that
when two teams of general equal caliber meet, the home advantage
should be a bit of a determining factor. But I also believe that sheer
talent will overshadow any amount of “psyching up” a team may have
done in preparation for any game.

Pitt’s only victory has come over a team~that is just beginning to be
seen in the proper light. Dorsett ran for 265 yards and still Pitt won by
just seven points. Inconsistency has plagued the Panthers so far this
year, mainly due to the abscence of some key personel. _

Going into last week’s tilt with Tulane, the Pitt defense took the
spotlight as the key to victory. Well, the defense came through but the
offense didn’t. The youth of the team is no assest either.

So, as the Panthers drilled with flyswatters in hand and music

_ blaring over the Stadium speakers (“The Songs of West Virginia”),

some particular verses were heard.

“Almost heaven, West
Virginia...” Almost.‘ '

“If we make a good showing
against Temple, then we’ve proved
that we really are a good soccer
team,” commented Bill Rex before
last Saturday's 2-1 loss to the Owls.

The score was tied 1-1 when-

Temple put in the winning penalty
kick. "‘I was extremely pleased’
with the play of the team against
Temple,” said Coach Bemis. “Not
only that, but I think we should
have won. what both coaches
agreed was a poorly refereed
game.
Maybe the Pitt team is better than

its 1-4-1 record indicates, and a win -

"this Saturday at West Virginia
could just about prove that.

The Mountaineers are coming into
the game with a winning record, A
something. that the Panthers would
desperately like to have. The
Mounties so far this year have

-defeated Baltimore U., a team that

lost to the champion in the NCAA
playoffs last year, by a score of 5-0.

They have also beat Penn‘Stae 3-1,
St. Francis 12-0, and Towson State

7.0. ‘ -

The one West Virginia loss has
come at the hands of St. Louis by a
score of 4-1, only after the ,
Mounties lostboth their All-Ameri-
can from Nigeria, Joe Okhakhu,
and theirhigh scoring wing in the
first part of the game. The tie was
with Quincy College in tournament
play.

There is no, question that the
Panthers will be facing a capable
opponent this weekend and for
that "reason Coach Bemis has
brought up Nick Chrisamthon from
the freshman squad to strengthen

' himself at the wing position.

“We have to improve our wing
play,” Coach Bemis has said many
times. “I think that with adding
Nick to the lineup it strengthens us
in the wing position and at this
point I’m really not sure who will
start at wing when we hit West

West Virginia also, has a
quarterback coming off the injured
list. New Castle native Chuck
Fiorante made his first appearance
of the season \ last week. The
starting assignment will go to Adé
Dillion. "

,According to WVU Sports
Information Director Dick Polen,
Dillon is more of a running
quarterback. If the Pitt defense
contains the Mountaineers on the
ground, Fiorante may see some
action. ‘ _ V

West Virginia's opening three
victories earned it some national
attention, _but it was lost with last
week's defeat at the hands of
Indiana. 28-14. Previously, WVU
had beat Maryland, Virginia Tech,
and Illinois.-

Pitt will be trying to return to the
.500 mark, its record now standing
at 1-2-1. Pitt leads the series,

Both head coaches have been
trying to-play down the rivalry
between the schools. ‘,‘lt’s a big

game‘ for our fans,” said WVU‘

coach Bobby Bowden. “It’s
important to the team because we
need a victory after last week's
loss. It doesn't matter who we're

West Virginia Tangles  
With Harriers Today

BY RICK SHRUM

Following a two-week layoff, the
Pitt cross’-country team returns to
action with a three o'clock home
meet -this afternoon against arch-
rival West Virginia.

The Mountaineers come to Sch-
enley Park with a squad that nearly
upset Pitt at last month's California
State Invitational. The Cats won
the meet, but by only four points
over their southern neighbors.

“West Virginia is a strong, young ,,

team," said Panther coach Jim
Banner. “They finished second at
California, and have lost only twice
(to Ball State and Penn State) in six
other meets. _
The Cats will be threatened
today by a trio of classy
Mountaineer

Metter. Kasich will probably be a
key to the final outcome, as he
finished first at Cal. State.
Hawkins, :1 Speedster from Union-
town, and Metter have also
contributed heavily to WVU’s
recent track success.

Pitt may have to face its own
problems today, as Sophomore Bob
O'Neill and Freshman Terry Wile
could be physically sub-par.

O’Neill is currently handicapped

with a bad knee (thought by Banner

to have occured “on the hard
course at California”), and Wile is
slightly hobbled by an ankle injury

that may be more nagging than

serious.

also looked good in practice,
according to Banner, and has
impressed the coach with -“his
quick adjustment from short
distance running to long distance
running in such a short time."
Although Wile is the number
six-man for “Banner’s Babies,"
his presence is ‘deeply appreciated
by the Panther coach.

“Terry’s presence is vital, as the
sixth man holds the key to our
success,” he said. “Not only does
he prevent opposing runners from
scoring high, but he is also our last
long distance runner. We suffer
from a complete lack of depth, and
don’t have much after number six.
If something were to happen to one‘
of our runners, we’d have to use a
half-miler from the track team--and
he'd be too inexperienced at this
time.”

Soheading in today’s meet, the
essentials appear to be: a] the
abilities of West Virginia’s big

,three; and b] the health’ of the Cats.

Banner thinks a letter ’c’ should be
included.

“I believe desire will play a vital I
role Friday,” Bannersaid. “Our
meets with West Virginia have
always been great rivalries and
their, kids never have trouble
getting up.” When we went down
there last year, several students
were wearing “Beat Pitt” shirts--
which is rather unusual support for
a cross-country meet. With the‘

football game coming up Saturday, '

and the Cal. State meet sticking in
their minds, West Virginia should
be sky-high Friday.” -

‘ Tryouts for the Pitt junior varsity
basketball team will be held on-
Monday, October 15 at 4:00 at the
Field House.

Offensive Linemen:

BY VINCE DI NARDO

The fact is a very old one, but the
message relentlessly rings true. If
you are a football player envious of
noteriety, stay the heck away from
the offensive line. -

Offensive linemen are nameless
faces who spend their time on the
gridiron planting their heads in the
midsections of All-American
honors seeking defensive linemen.
Their noses become very familiar
with the ground, which means
these poor guys don't even get to
see the football game they are
playing in. They have to wait until
the Sunday films to see Tony
Dorsett in action. And alas, the
only time they get any ink is when a
sportswriter feels sorry for them or
when their ineptitude blows a
game.  .

-With all these thankless re-
wards, what would behoove anyone
to be an offensive lineman, and,

how does a man approach
coaching the position?

Joe Avazzano, who played
offensive guard at Florida State
and who had a cup of coffee with
the Boston Patriots, knows what he
has to contend with in his capacity
as offensive line coach. He has
used a low-key approach with a lot

of emphasis on comradeship to"

attain satisfying success.
_‘‘If they asked for volunteers to
be offensive linemen, I don't think

there would such a position,"

Avazzano smirked. “No one
notices us unless we screw up.
“My philosophy is a low-key,
close knit approach. We strive for
respect among our peers, realizing
that if we succeed, we will gain the
respect of the whole team.”
Since there are no statistics by
which the offensive line can
publicly be graded, an inside view
and overall figures have to be used.

Catches

For instance, the pass protection
has been commendable. In the
four games, quarterback Bill
Daniels has been sacked a mere
four times due to breakdowns.
Also in four games, the line has
opened holes to power Dorsett to
564 yards. True, a runner like
Dorsett doesn’t need the big holes,
but the old adage says that a
runner is only as good as his line.

Also--and get this--Avazzano’s
troops have only been guilty of one
penalty so far this year--a ﬁve yard
motion penalty last week. '

WHO THEY?

Senior tackle Dave Wannstedt at
6-5, 245 has been the annonymous
leader of the bunch. Last week,
Dave was awarded the Panther of
the week award by playing the best
game. “He’s our leader,"
Avazzano said. “Since spring he
has lost a lot of weight and has
been my highest grader.”

and John Robb at the guards, and
center Mike Carey, have also done
well in anchoring the middle.

Olsen, a 6-1, 220 pounder from
Nesconset, N.Y., has been coming
on like gangbusters in recent
weeks. In the last two games, he
has made the best downﬁeld block
and has been tapped ‘Dong of the.
Week’ as a result. At 6-3, 230,
Stoner has been a model of
courage. Since last spring, Stoner
has had a knee.operation and has
