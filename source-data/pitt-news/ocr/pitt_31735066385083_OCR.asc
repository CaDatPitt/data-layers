Black
student
issues
examined

By Lisa Broujos

‘ Staff Writer

”Black Students United for Ac-
tion" was the theme of Friday
night's conference on black stu-
dent issues, sponsored by the Na-
tional Society of Black Engineers
at Engineering Hall.

James Keith Motley, the associ-
ate dean and director of the Afri-
can American Institute at
Northeastern University in
Boston, gave the keynote address
and also moderated the panel dis-
cussion which took place af-
terwards.

Every black organization on

campus was represented to dis-

1 cuss unity and to address issues

of black students on campus.

Motley, a native of Pittsburgh
and a recipient of numerous aca-
demic and athletic awards,
opened his remarks with the un-
derlying theme that ”black stu-
dents united will never be
defeated.” .

Throughout his speech, Motley
said that black people need to re-
tain a sense of belonging and
worth. ”We still walk around
sometimes acting as if we were
visitors,” he said.

”Some people walk around try-
ing to hide the fact that they are
black. But then their ethnic visi-
bili-ty catches up to them,” he
said, ”because black is black.”

Motley said, ”We need to de-
vise some kind of strategy here
tonight that will deal with some
of our attitudes so that we can
start taking action [on the
issues].”

Eric Moreland, a member of
Black Academic Development,

‘ said, ”There is no possible way

that someone can come to you
and tell you that your race is ge-
netically inferior.’_’

Mark Collins, representing the
Black Action Society, the umbrel-

’ la organization of all the black or-

ganizations on campus, said that
blacks should not only unite to
confront issues but unite ”to be
ready to confront” a problem if
it arises.

”We shouldn't wait for some-
thing negative to happen to get
together,” said Rose Thompson,
representing Gamma Sigma Sig-
ma, a service sorority.

Richard Nicklos, the confer-
ence chairman, stressed the posi-
tive aspects of the conference and
said that the black community on

Arthritis
center  
helps the
afflicted

By Jim Tezak

For The Pitt News

Contrary to popular miscon-
ceptions, arthritis is more than
just a few minor aches and pains
that affect people as they get
older.

”You can't put an age bracket
on arthritis. The belief that arthri-
tis only affects older people is one
of the biggest misconceptions
about arthritis,” said Margo Bier-
nesser, of the Western Pennsylva-
nia chapter of the Arthritis
Foundation. ’

Arthritis is the No. 1 chronic
crippling health condition in
America, according to Bierness-
er. There are more than 100
forms of the disease affecting ev-
ery age group. .

One out of every seven Ameri-
cans has some form of arthritis.
Lupus, gout, juvenile arthritis and
osteoarthritis are just a few types
of arthritis that affect a wide range
of people, said Biernesser.

Because there are so many A
types of arthritis, Biernesser says,
”No one really knows what
causes [the disease]/’ .

Proper treatment and medica
tion can control arthritis, though
very little can be done to prevent
it.

Biernesser observed, ”There is
specific evidence that overweight
people put more stress on their
joints. We recommend exercise
and having a balanced diet, but
there haven't been any scientific
studies to prove that arthritis can
be prevented.” ’

Most victims of arthritis can still
lead productive, pleasurable lives
if they recognize the early signs
of the disease and get prompt

Election processes in Pennsylvania viewed

By Jeff Barker

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) —— Penn-
sylvanians may think the state

makes its choice for president on ‘

Election Day, but it won't happen
officially until 25 men and wom-
en convene at a highly ceremoni-
al meeting on Dec. 19.

The meeting in Harrisburg is
the most visible Pennsylvania
component of the Electoral Col-
lege, the ritualized, often misun-
derstood system that America
uses to choose its presidents.

In Pennsylvania, the Electoral

College means that voters on

Nov. 8 will not be electingl

Republican George Bush or
Democrat Michael Dukakis, but
rather faceless ”e|ectors” of the
two candidates.

The Bush and Dukakis cam-
paigns have already submitted to
the Pennsylvania Bureau of Elec-
tions their lists of 25 electors.
Mostly, the campaigns picked
party loyalists to represent them.

”By and large, it's people who
were with us for the last several
months, and we wanted to give
them a little reward,” said Lanny

Johnson, campaign director for

Dukakis in Pennsylvania.

At the Harrisburg meeting, the
winning electors will be bound
by custom, but not by law, to
vote for the candidate who
received the most votes in the
state.

While no Pennsylvania elector
has ever been known to abandon
the triumphant candidate, there

has been such deviation in other

states.

In 1972, a Virginia elector vot-
ed for a Libertarian Party candi-
date. In 1976, a Washington
elector refused to vote for Gerald
Ford, who carried the state, be-

cause of Ford's unwillingness to
endorse a constitutional amend-
ment to ban abortion.

Sometimes voters have trouble
understanding why the system re-
quires the intermediary step of an
electors’ meeting.

Why not just have Pennsylva-
nia’s 25 electoral votes automat-
ically placed in the winner's
column?

”|t’s the same reason you have
a funeral before you dump a
body into the ground. It's a need
for ritual, for ceremony,” said

White House claims hostage is to be released

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States has been told by
another government that a
hostage held by Iranian sym-
pathizers in Lebanon will be
released imminently, President
Reagan's chief spokesman said
today.

Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said U.S. government officials
”received reports” this morning
that a hostage would be set free
and added that the reports came
from a ”third—party government in
the region.” .

NBC News reported that Alann
Steen, 48, of Boston, a journalism
professor at Beirut University Col-
lege, was being released. State
Department officials said they
could not confirm the report.

Reactor safety
record defended

WASHINGTON (AP) —— The
DuPont Co. on Sunday defend-
ed its operation of nuclear
weapons reactors at the Savan-
nah River Plant in the wake of
strong criticism on Capitol Hill
over safety conditions at the
South Carolina facility.

The safety of the Department of
Energy reactors came under

   
 

heavy criticism at a congression-
al hearing Friday. One depart-
ment official compared the
situation to the ill-fated space
shuttle Challenger.

A 1985 memorandum dis-
closed at the hearing listed 30 in-
cidents at the five Savannah River
reactors between 1957 and 1985.
They included one in which fuel
rods melted and another in which
a chain reaction nearly went out
of control.

strengthen the ties of unity among

”The conference was a signifi-

Certain issues that need to be
addressed are ”improving the
level of academic achievement
among black students” and black
student retention, according to

One panelist suggested a tutori-

Pennsylvania's electors usually
convene in the chambers of the
state House of Representatives.

”|t’s a very traditional meeting
that follows a script handed down
over the past 200 years,” said Bill
Boehm, commissioner of the
Bureau of Elections.

”The first order of business is
to elect officers. We actually fol—
low a script, and sometimes
there's a run—through first. There
are all kinds of motions that are
made,” he said.

After Pennsylvania electors cast

their ballots, the documents are
sent to Washington, where the
nation's 538 Electoral College
ballots are counted at a joint ses-
sion of Congress.

Since most states give all their
electoral votes to the candidate
who carried their states, no mat-
ter how slim the margin, it is pos-
sible for a candidate to win the
national plurality but lose the
election.

”Some general practitioners
don't know about, or aren't
caught up on, treatments for ar-

A person should, therefore, be
able to recognize the warning
signs of arthritis. According to
Biernesser, symptoms include:
swelling in one or more joints,
early morning stiffness, recurring
pain or tenderness in a joint, ina-
bility to move a joint normally
and obvious redness or warmth
in a joint.

THE PITT NEWS

Strock happy to be on the Browns’ sidelnll

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Anybody at Sunday"’s Browns-
Steelers game wonder who that
lanky, graying 37-year-old gent
was, the one who was standing

on the sideline playfully slapping?

hands with the Cleveland Browns
rookie quarterback Steve Slay-
den, acting like one of the boys,
and sporting an October tan that
one could only find on the most
prodigious Floridian sunbathers
or links loafers?

It was only the NFL’s premier
full-time relief pitcher, the best
since the days of Earl Morrall or
George Blanda. —

' A "player who backed Morrall
himself, as well as other Miami
Dolphins superstars like 1 Bob
Griese, Dan Marino and ifthings
work out, Cleveland's Bernie
Kosar.

It was Don Strock, and for the
first time in 15- years, he wasn't
wearing No. 10 and the aqua and
orange of the Miami Dolphins.

After an unpleasant contract
dispute with his former team, he

* has dumped the aqua, burned the

orange a bit and now wears No.
12 for the Cleveland Browns.

But it took injur_ies to Browns
QBs Bernie /Kosar, and Gary
Danielson for Strock to find him-
self back in uniform.

Kosar, who has led the Browns
to the AFC championship the last
two seasons, injured his elbow in
the team's season opener against
Kansas City-. Danielson suffered a
broken ankle the following week
against the New York Jets.

The newest Cleveland starter,
third-stringer journeyman Mike
Pagel, had seen only limited play-
ing time during his previous sea-

sons in the league, so his
performing status was shaky at
best.

The Browns needed more
security than Slayden, a 22-year-
old from Duke who was cut in
training camp, then resigned,
could provide. So they dialed ”S”
for Strock, who was enjoying his
brief retirement on the golf
courses of south Florida.

’’I knew I'd be somewhere this
year,” said a confident Strock fol-
lowing his team's 23-9 win over
the Steelers. ’’It was just a matter
of time. It's nice to be back with
a contender.”

After a Super Bowl appearance
in 1984 and a trip to the AFC
Championship game in 1985,
Miami failed to make the playoffs
the last two years, finishing 8-8
then 8-7 last season.

’’I had 15 great years in Mia-
mi,” said Strock, who admitted
he has no hard feelings toward
his former club. ‘'1 still have a lot
of friends there.”

But does he miss anything
about playing for the Dolphins?

”Nothing.”

Strock threw for 4,316 yards
and 39 touchdowns during his
days with the Miami. A graduate
of Virginia Tech, he was select-
ed in the fifth round of the 1973
draft by the Dolphins and spent
his first season on the taxi squad.

His most memorable pro per-
formance came on Jan. 2, 1982,
during the AFC semifinal be-
tween Miami and San Diego.
”The Miracle That Died” read the
headline in the Miami Herald fol-
lowing San Diego's heart-
stopping 41-38 win, which is
considered one of the greatest

football games of all time.

About four years ago, some
students tried to initiate a ski
racing team at Pitt, but their ef-
forts failed due to lack of or-

, ganization. Two years ago, a

different group of students
tried again. Due to those ef-
forts, Pitt now has a ski racing
team with a strong member-
ship that is anxiously awaiting
the upcoming ski season.

The club's racing season in-
cludes four local races and
one weekend of regionals.
Regionals are made up of 13
teams from various colleges
throughout Pennsylvania and
West Virginia, Penn State, Pitt-

Johnstown and Penn are some

of the other teams.

The race consists of timed
runs including slalom and gi-
ant slalom events. Last year,
the races were held at various
resorts in the Pennsylvania
area, including Elk Mountain
in the Poconos.

Expected to lead the club on
the slopes this year are Steve
Helm and his sister Karen. The
Helms were instrumental in
getting the team formed two

years ago.

Pitt ski racing team
looking to pull away
from pack this year

Helm consistently took first
, in local races last year and is
being counted on to place
high again this year. The addi-
tion of three new experienced
ski racers is expected to make
up for the absence of Todd
Snelbaker, one of last year's
top racers, who is taking this
season off. The men managed
a sixth place finish last year
out of the 13 regional schools.
Ms. Helm, team co-captain,
also placed first in local races
for the women's team last sea-
son. Sophomore Mick Bot-
scheller is likewise expected
to help the women's team this
year. Due to lack of member-
ship, the women salvaged a
ninth-place regional finish last
year. 1
But the competitions and
order of finish aren't the main
emphasis of the club.
'”We’re basically out there
to have fun. No one is going
to get down on anybody if
they perform poorly. The main
thing is that we have a good
time," said Co-President Mike
Abowd.
”We’re ‘not stressing the rac-
ing part; we're stressing the
training,” added Ms. Helm.

Olympic boxing controversy might 
force end of sport in coming years

Just a few pieces left over from
a sports weekend:

0 In light of recent controver-
sial circumstances, the Interna-
tional Olympic Committee is

rumored to be thinking about
banning boxing for the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

The one match that everyone
seems to be focusing on is the
robbery that American Roy Jones
had to suffer through Saturday
night.

Jones was boxing Korean Park
Si-Hun in the gold medal match
at 156 pounds. Just casually ob-
serving the match, it seemed that
Jones severely beat his opponent.
The NBC graphic that counted
punches also showed Jones with
a distinct advantage.

The judges, or at least three of
the five anyway (those from Ura-
guay, Uganda and Morocco), saw
a different match. They awarded
the gold to Park and Jones was
distraught.

Rightfully 50.

After the match, Jones was so
upset that he said he may quit the
boxing ring, which had probably
been a love of his for as long as
he could remember. Then, in
yesterday's Washington Post,
Jones said, ”I thought they'd an-
nounced the wrong corner.”

In my mind, this stems from
1984, when the Koreans thought
they were given a raw deal when

fighting American boxers.

It is obvious that this is not
right. First of all, none of the box-
ers on this U.S. team was on the
teamlin '84. Second, the Korean
was so severely beaten that it was

       

viNoE    
CAREY

obvious the judges were just go-
ing after the American. Third,
even the Korean people were up-
set by the ruling, evidence for this
being their sending letters and
voicing their opinion that the rul-
ing was not right.

Then, after this was done, Jones
was named the most outstanding
boxer at the Olympics.

Instead of banning Olympic
boxing altogether, the IOC
should just regulate the judges.

Instead of giving every country
equal representation, why don't
they just make a regular board of
judges who will do all Olympic
matches?

They could screen the prospec-
tive members of this board just
like they do a jury. Weed out
anybody who would show any
type of bias.

This wasn't the only incident,
of course. Earlier in the games,
two Korean corner men jumped
into the ring to attack the referee
after their fighter lost. It caused a
riot around the ring, and the ref
had to be escorted out by police
and Olympic security.

This is an unfortunate incident,
but isn't indicative of the whole
sport. It was only the Koreans in-
volved, and they were con-
demned for it.

In the Olympics, boxing is one
of the most exciting sports. Every
match is action-packed because
you can only win on points.
There is no dancing around like
there is in the pros.

A ban of this sport would be
wrong. Granted, changes will
have to be made before '92, but
to do away with it completely
would be a disservice to every-
one associated.

The U.S. Olympic boxing team
is one of the strongest in the
world. Their biggest competition

The club trains once a week
at Laurel Mountain, Hidden
Valley or Seven Springs. The
training consists of various
practice runs and small races
among themselves. Since they
don't have a coach, the mem-
bers help each other and learn
from each other.

Helm, the most experienced
racer in the club, gives advice
and technique to the inex-
perienced members.

No racing experience is
necessary to join the club, but
an ability to downhill ski is ap-
preciated. The ski racing team
differs from the ski club in that
it offers instruction and the op-
portunity to race.

”The ski club is for everyone
who wants to ski for recrea-
tional purposes. The ski racing
team is an outlet for people in-
terested in learning and ex-
periencing ski racing
situations,” said Abowd.

Interest in the club has
grown significantly over the
last years. In its first year, only
about six students were active
on the team. Last year, the
number of active members
grew to 20 people. This year's

team is expected to boast

is a c|ub‘sport, anybody can
join, graduate or undergradu-
ate students.

”A lot of people are interest-
ed, but money is a big
problem,” said Co-President
Andy Myers, in reference to
the little financial help the
university provides.

The funding comes mostly
from various fund-raising ac-
tivities such as raffles, hoagie
sales and ski tuning clinics per-
formed by the club members.
The remainder of the funding
comes from the members
themselves.

Part of the funding this year
will be used for a trip to an
East Coast ski resort the club
is planning for Christmas or
spring break.

”Probably Vermont," said
Myers, ”but everything goes
back to the money issue.”

Strock-

”You’re sure going back a long
way,” Strock said when the con-
test was mentioned to him.

In that game, he came off the
bench to rally the Dolphins from
a 24-0 deficit to a 38-31 lead by
completing 29 of 43 passes for
403 yards and four touchdowns,
including the famous hook—and—'
lateral score before the half.

But today, Strock downplays
his effort.

”The thing that sticks out in my
mind the most is that we lost. It

was a tough one to lose There

have been a lot of great perfor-

  

mances by people, but losing
takes away the luster from

everything.”
What Strock is concerned with
now is the present — the

Cleveland Browns — and not
what went on in the past.

’’If this is going to be an article
about what happened in Miami
[his contract troubles], then I
don't want to talk about it  I
love [playing in Cleveland]. This
is a different type of organization,
different people. Of course, it's
going to be different wherever
you go, but it's great here. Every-

one has been real nice to me as
soon as I came in.”

Now in the twilight of his
career, Strock seems to be happy
with his accomplishments as a
player. ”l’ve played in three Su-
per Bowls, and l have a winning
ring. This is my 16th year in the
NFL. Not many guys get to play
16 years in this Ieague.”

And how would he like to see
it all come to a close?

’’In Miami, Florida on January

22 [the sight of this year's Super A

Bowl]. I'd be happy with that.
A pause. ”That would be an in-

terestng place to end it, wouldn't
it?”

Cubans had made the trip, the

Steelers face problems

after loss to Cleveland

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

His Pittsburgh Steelers are bat-
tered, bruised and beaten, which
means Coach Chuck Noll doesn't
know whether Brister, Bono or
Blackledge will be his starting
quarterback Sunday in Phoenix.

Bubby Brister was expected to
be out indefinitely after dislocat-
ing the middle finger on his right
hand in Sunday's 23-9 loss to
Cleveland.

Brister, who led AFC passers
before throwing for only 28 yards
against the Browns, has been one
of the few bright spots for the
Steelers, 1-4, who have last four
straight games for the first time
since 1969.

”His finger is swollen up and

it's on his passing hand, but
they're talking about taping it
together,” Noll said at his week-
ly news conference. ’’I don't
know what that's going to mean
when it comes time to throw a
football. He's got a [bruised] leg,
and that's a problem right now,
too.”

Steve Bono, the Steelers’ strike
team quarterback a year ago, was
at a disadvantage after replacing
Brister in the third quarter Sunday
because of his lack of practice
time, Noll said. Bono completed
seven of 25 passes for 83 yards
and two interceptions. Brister was
four of 14 for 28 yards and two
interceptions.

Brister, in his first season as an
NFL starter, has been getting all
of the practice snaps ”because
we felt he needed as much [prac-
tice] time as we could give him,”
Noll said.

Todd Blackledge was expected
to battle Brister for the starting job
during training camp, but Brister
quickly seized the position as the
Steelers won three of four presea-
son games. Blackledge hasn't
played this season.

”Todd throws the ball long ex-

’ ceptionally well and Steve has

the combination [of throwing
long and short],” Noll said.
”Todd can run the offense,
there's no problem with that 
[but] Steve's tempo is more like
Bubby’s.”

Noll said fullback Frank Pollard
(knee) and defensive back Delton
Hall (fractured wrist and grain in-

’ jury) may return this week.

Noll also said Hall will shift
from right cornerback to strong
safety because of injuries to Cor-
nell Gowdy and Larry Griffin.
Hall allowed three touchdowns
in his first three games while
playing with a painful wrist inju-
ry that hampered his ability to
jam receivers.

The Steelers’ losing streal<?'?ils
their longest since they lost 13
straight after winning their 1969
season opener.

”All of a sudden you get tired
of losing, and you gut it up and
get nasty,” Noll said. ”You can
turn that into a plus.”

East German woman

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —
East German swimmer Kristin
Otto, first woman ever to win six
gold medals in one Olympics,
received a gold crown Monday
as most valuable player of the

57Seou| Games.

The Paek Sang crown, made of

‘20-karat gold and designed after

the headgear of ancient Korean
warriors, cost $11,000, its donors
said.

SPORTS BRIEFS

The award, presented by the
Korean newspapers Hankook
Ilbo, Korea Times and Daily
Sports, takes its name from the

53, pen name of the late Chang Key-

young, a member of the Korean
Olympic Committee and found-
er of the three newspapers.
Although this was not an offi-
cial award of the International
Olympic Committee, the winner
was chosen by a panel of four
IOC members — Kim Un—yong of
Korea, Anita, DeFrantz of the
United States, Pal Schmitt of
Hungary and Jan Staubo of Nor-
way — and Chun I Byung-kyu,

'0 chairman of the Paek Sang Foun-

dation.

Nick Leyva named
new Philly manager

» PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Nick
Leyva, the St. Louis Cardinals’
third-base coach, Monday was
named the Philadelphia Phillies’

gthird manager in three years.

General Manager Lee Thomas
said Leyva, 35, was the only can-
didate considered to replace Lee
Elia, who was fired Sept. 23. Elia
had replaced John Felske in June
of 1987.

Thomas said Leyva was given

0* a one-year contract.

”There is no particular reason
for one year, but I hope he will
be here for a long time. I hope we
both will,” Thomas said.

The appointment of Leyva was
the latest move in an effort to
rebuild a club that was picked to
contend for the National League
East title, but wound up in the
cellar with a 65-96 record, 35‘/2
games behind the champion
New York Mets.

One of the key criticisms of the
Phillies during their disastrous NL
East finish was that the team

“named MVP at Seoul

lacked an emotional quality.

’’I saw them play 18 times,”
Leyva said. ”The biggest disap-
pointment [to me] was an attitude
problem.

”Winning is contagious, so is
losing. It seems like it [losing] was
accepted here. We've got to
change that.”

Trade sends Parrish

to California Angels

PHILADELPHIA — The
Philadelphia Phillies announced
Monday that they had traded
catcher Lance Parrish to the
California Angels for right-
handed pitcher David.HoIdridge.

Parrish, 32, came to the Phillies
as a free agent in the spring of
1987 after failing the reach agree-
ment with the Detroit Tigers.

In his first season with the Phil-
lies, Parrish hit a disappointing
.245 with 17 home runs and 67
RBI.

The six-time American League
All—Star had problems again this
past season, hitting .215 with 17
home runs and 60 RBI.

Parrish is among the players
who may be set free when an ar-
bitrator discloses penalties
against the major—|eague owners
who were found guilty of collu-
sion in prohibiting the signing of
major free agents.

It was the second time that an
arbitrator ruled against the own-
ers in a collusion case.

But it is believed that Califor-
nia agreed to terms with Parrish
and that if he is declared a free
agent by the arbitrator, he will
waive the right.

Holdridge, 19, was the Angels’
first-round selection in the 1987
draft as compensation for Reggie
Jackson signing with the Oakland
Athletics. Jackson left the Angels
and became a free agent.

Holdridge did not pitch profes-
sionally in 1987, making his pro
debut this summer with the
Quad-City Class A Midwest
League team in Davenport, Iowa.

Pitt's men's cross country team was almost able to upset national power Bucknell Saturday.

Men ’s cross country team runs to
second place finish over weekend

By Scott Campbell
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men's cross country
team turned in a strong perfor-
mance Saturday, finishing a close
second behind national power-
house Bucknell in a four—team
meet at Schenley Park.

Pitt was winning with one mile
left, but a strong Bucknell surge
gave the Bisons the 26-29 victo-
ry over Pitt.

Bucknell has now won over
150 straight meets dating back to
1974. The 26-29 score was the
closest Bucknell has come to los-
ing in four years.

West Virginia finished third,
losing to Pitt 23-33, while St.
John's finished fourth. Pitt also
beat the Redmen 15-50.

Pitt coach John Vasvary was
pleased with the race.

”It was a good race for us,”
Vasvary said. ”Everyone ran as
well as expected. Bucknell is a
great team, and it was great to get
them to come here and to give

them a competitive race.”

Paul Friedrich led the way for
the Panthers, finishing second
overall with a time of 25:22, two

seconds behind Bucknell’s Steve"

West.

Friedrich, who admitted that he
has been running terribly lately,
and who was just hoping for a top
10 performance, said, ’’I was real-

ly scared today before the race, ,

but I have a lot more confidence
now. I'm really happy with -my
race. I don't think I could have

. run any faster today.”

Friedrich said he pulled into
second place at about the two-
mile mark but that in the last
mile, ”I was dying coming
around the last loop. I thought
everybody was going to catch
me. But once I got to the top of
the last hill, I felt I still had some-
thing left, so I kicked it in.”

Other top Pitt finishers includ-
ed Scott Humphrey in seventh
place with a time of 25:40, Craig
Woshner in eighth with 25:45, Ja-
son Bodner ran 25:48 for ninth

place, and Keith Dowling
finished 11th at 26:00.
Saturday's meet was the biggest
home meet for Pitt in over 10
years.
Coach Vasvary said: ”We’ve

_ gotten our program to the point

that we can have good teams
come in here and run because
they know it's going to be a good
meet for them. We wanted to put
on as good a show as we can, in

order to bring the Big East Cham- J

pionship meet here for next
year.”

Next year is a long way off. As
far as this season is concerned,
Friedrich feels the team is on their
way.

”Our goal is to win the Big East
this year, but we also want to go
to the National Championships,
and now we're one step closer,”
Friedrich said.

Pitt's next meet is Oct. 15 at
Navy, followed a week later by
the Big East Championship at
Cortland Park, N.Y. A
