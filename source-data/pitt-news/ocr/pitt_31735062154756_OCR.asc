‘introduced at council meeting on

The fact that the‘ University li-

which ‘can not be obtained from

son" by students requesting action
by council. ‘

Other business enacted in the

Frederick J. Sangster, president

“The proper place to show enthusi-
asm for a football"game is at the

Say’  A &/

. - Players

 

The generaliopihion of the Wash-
Jeff varsity, is that the ‘better team
won last Saturday’s game and that
Pitt will take over Carnegie with-
out much trouble, ‘according to their
statements in’th,e‘ dressing room im-
mediately , after la s t Saturday’s
game. The Presidents held Carnegie

-to a scoreless tie four weeks ago.

Captain Douds said that Pitt has
the better club, but that the Pan-
thers are not three touchdowns bet-
ter than his Presidents. He said the
breaks were agaiiist‘ his team in the
second half. He also stated that this
year’s squad is the best Wash-Jeff
team he -has played on. . “

Butler, Wash-Jeff’s hefty uarter-
back, when questioned, sai , “Pitt
wi_ll beat Tech by.one touchdown.”
He is of the opinion that the breaks
favored Pitt when Parkinson and
Uansa gotcup and ran again after
they were thought to be downed in
last Saturday’s game.

V Small.»Margin
Walter Levine, who was the de-
fensive star of the game, said, “We
didn't expect Pitt to run awaywith
us; we expected. thescore to -be

Amos Comments

- Coach Bill Amos was proud of the
strong display his boys gave Satur-
day. He thinks, despite the score,
that Pitt is only seven points better
than his team. (He agrees with others
that Pitt will run away with the
Tartans. Amos ‘is building for the
future, and it’s no secret that he
will be back next season, with al-

most. the whole team intact, "seeking

to down the Panthers. , _ .
Fred Bode, Langley High‘ school

says that ,Pitt will be ,undefeate*d

A great Panther eleven proved in
a concise and conclusive ‘manner to
some‘39-,0O0 ‘spectators at the sta-

national championship calibre, when

, a clever, speedy Wash-Jeff squad

fell, before its superioriplay, 21 to 0.

brought their total number of points

Again the players who. have been
receiving commendable comment by
football experts’ all over’ the country,
starred in Saturday’s' » ame. . The
slippery. Uansa, whokis a out as easy
to tackle as a scared rabbit, ‘played
with the same reckless abandon to
get. away for ‘sten long gains
on of-tack;/le and wide end run plays.
His broken field running-,.'aided by a
Sutherland coached interference,
was completely baffling to the Presi-
dents. . A '

Parkinson, another Pitt all-Ameri-
can candidate, played havoc with the
Wash—Jeff line. He continually swept’
through the middle of ‘the line for

_ five or more yards and his work on

the secondary defense was a. ver-
itable bulwark for , the Sutherland
charges. ‘ ‘ ,
Donchess, Montgomery and Ca -

tain Dimeoloalso played spirited y‘

and thesemen formed the-main part
of the Panther interference that has
worked so successfully‘ this season.
The one weak“p'oint in the Pan-
ther play Saturday was the failure
to cope with the Wash-Jeff aerial
attack. The Pitt Qfense, ‘for the
most part,'fail'e.d to ruin any of ‘the
Presidents’ forward ‘passing at-
tempts, and the resultant yardage
gained continually endangered’ the
Gold and 7 Blue. The Presidents
gained a total of 118 yards by means
of _ its . clever passing and many
times drove -deep’ into the Panther
territory before being stopped. Wil-

Pitt tennis players and followers,

of the net sport in this district
were shocked’ by‘ the. death of Dr.

spring when he“wa's' taken by death..

Dr. Stephens. was the?.’oldest ten-

ciated with tennis for the ant
thirty years. _
ing business college at Wheeling,
W. Va., but ‘at that time had-no in-
terest in the net game. Upon grad-
uating, he studied at, medical
schools, including New York post-
graduate, Hahnemann medical school
at Philadelphia, and later ‘received
a, degree from the Rush, medical
school of the ‘University of Chico 0.
Following his -college career, r.

‘Stephens took up tennis, along with
the practice of the. medical profes-_

sion.

In his thirteen years of coaching.
tennis at Pitt, Dr. Stephens ledhis
boys through two undefeated, sea-

beaten’ and on an eastern ‘tour de-
feated West’Point, Rutgers, Col-
gate and Syracuse, holding all up-
ponents scoreless except Rutgers,
which registered a‘ lone point against
Stephen's men that year." Last-year
his team was also undefeated.

._o.._.

Folks, here comes the one for
tomorrow up at. us, although
we are just a little sha‘ky‘abo‘ut~
this Carnegie‘ Tech prediction.
Bear in ‘mind, fellow‘ students,
that ‘it was made before the ‘
West Virginia game.‘ »It’s Pitt -
21, Carnegieq.6. Th_ ﬁt’s_-just a
little’ more than a“ we touch-
down margin and it‘ looks‘ like a.
pretty good bet at even money.
Believe it or not, but some people
in the past have actually objected
to these bedtime stories on “Predic-
tions.” _
that Wally Steifen will object to the
prediction this week, but to ‘the con-
trary, Jock Sutherland is theman
who doesn’t like this predicting and
overrating‘ business. ‘ ‘ ‘ «

.——o—-- . -
Regardless of what‘ the Cam-'
'pus Scout thinks -about the game
tomorrow, Coach Sutherland is
_taking‘it mighty’ serious. Suth-
erland ﬁgures it as a real tough
battle. To illustrate,‘ consider.
Jockwas asked. to speak at the
student pep meeting before the
Ohio State‘ game. He’ said, “I
really “think.” the boys are all
keyed up for the Ohio State. -
game. .1‘ would ratherspeak at
the pep rally before“t!v.e; Car-.
negie Tech game. That’s when
the boys .will need the most-
support.” ‘
Andso it came to pass that Coach
Sutherland; was exactly right about
‘the Ohio State.’ game and would
speak tonight, at the pre-Carnegie
game bonﬁrerally if he ‘did not have
to take‘ the team out o:f‘town.

Coach , Sutherland is, ’ doing «.
everything ‘in his power to im-

. press upon- his men the impor-
tance of a Pitt _victory»over Car-
negie Tech tomorrow. It is. im-
possible .to get a- statement-‘frond
any. player on the ‘Pitt team
--without the permission of Coach
Sutherland. He believes; ’ t h e,

. statements given out by‘ mem-
bers of an undefeated team oﬁer .
too ‘much chance for damage to '
the spirit of the entirefteam.

. Your Scoutpagrees with Jock in
‘this’ matter and to .-any newspaper
‘man who gets, statements from the
Pitt pla:V¢1,'sjin their dressing rooms
‘-after; the game” without the’ permis-
-sion ‘of;-Suther1a,nd~ your Scout will
disclose jhis‘ complicated method. of
predicting scores ‘with accuracy. You

To get back to, the game with
C_arne‘gi,e, we want you to get .
this straight. Although Carnegie .
boasts a good team, has not
been defeated * and held. Notre ~
Dame to a lone touchdown, that
old ball game out there on the»
ﬁeld tomorrow- doesn’t. mean a .,
whole lot to Pitt. ‘Beating Car-
negie Tech won’t mean so much,
for after all ‘Carnegie, is so
close and -we know’ her so ,_ well
that there isn’t any real‘ kick
in beating her. i A

V‘ . --0—-, ’— ,
Times have changed. in 1919,’
when Pitt-Tech games were the big
show, the Panthers ‘won .17 to 7. The
celebration after the game-at Forbes
Field and the general;-rumpus in the
Oakland district ‘that night and the
following Monday, forced .Pitt.‘and
Carnegie to break relations until
1923.‘ -

The Pitt ‘team, well on their
way to .a national title, have quit .
regarding victories over. the
-nearby teams as anything to.
raise general cain about. It’s
just -another game ' before, that
‘longjaunt to the Tournament of
Roses ‘game; and the only real
benefit Pitt will derive from.
beating the Tartans is the Pan-
thers will prove tothe general
footballpublic that- they could
take Notre Dame and Yale on
in the same afternoon‘ and Will-

. both games. “ ‘

. _o__ , , ./

In other words, tomorrow is the‘
big. dayafor Carnegie Tech. A vic-
tory for them over Pittwouldboost
their stock to thelimit. They have
everything to win‘ and little to lose,
while the_ Pitt team has only a_ holi-
day on Monday to look forward to
if they win and a tarnished season
if they lose. ‘ - i- s

Getting down to plain-facts,
tomorrow’s game is just another
step for the Panthers on» their
road to- the national football

‘ championship. However, t h i s
. does not detract from the possi-
-bilities offered by tomorrow’.-3
game‘ to the fans. That all-
American ‘backﬁeld of Perkin-t
, son.‘ Uansa, Williams and Baker
will thrill what. promises’ to be
m‘ the biggest crowd ‘ever to attend
ya ‘Pitt - ‘Carnegie -‘Tech football
game’.

Carnegie, with her good -line and
mediocre. ybac-k‘ﬁeId,.. should -give the
