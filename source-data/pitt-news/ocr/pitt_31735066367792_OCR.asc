School Holiday

Students and faculty members
will celebrate a double holiday in
July ——- a national and a Uni-
versity one. Stanton C._ Crawford,
‘secretary of the University and
clean of the faculties, announced
today that July 3 will be a Uni-
versity holiday.

Members ‘of Student Govern-
ment requested University offi-
cials to grant the extra vacation
day when out-of—town students
solicited for the ‘free day’ be-
cause the two-day break didn’t
warrant the expense of a trip
home. ~

Dean Crawford gained approval
for. the holiday from Chancellor
Litchﬁeld and the various deans.
There will be no class obligations
for graduate students or summer
students in addition to students
enrolled on the trimester.

to 1936.

Dr. Chan then transferred to
the University of Hawaii where
he was a professor of Chinese
Institutions, until 1942 when he
accepted his present position at
Dartmouth.

He represented‘China in a
number of international confer-
ences, including the'World Con-
ference of Higher Educational
Associations in Geneva, the Far
Eastern Conference on ' Higher
Education in Manila, and the
East-West Philosophers Confer-
ance in Honolulu.

Dr. Chan served as chairman of

the Council of Christian Higher.

1948-49, he was. awarded a Gug-
genheim Fellowship and spent the
year in China.

Communist Charge

Survey Gives
University Full
Accreditation

The University has received
full accreditation from the Mid-
dle States Association as a result
of its evaluation here last fall, Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford, University
secretary, has announced.

The unqualiﬁed approval from

the Commission on the Institute .
of Higher Education of the Middle C

States Association of Colleges and
Secondary schools is good forthe
next 1,0‘years.

This accreditation does not ap-
ply to the professional schools,
however, because these are rep-
resented by their own accrediting
committees. Dr. Crawford stated
that all of the professional schools
who have reported so far have
turned in favorable accreditations.

“A tremendous effort was ex-
erted but the results are aptly
summarized with the phrase ‘un-
qualified approval.’ There are no
restrictions, no progress reports
required and, on the whole, we
came out very well,” Crawford
said.

The “tremendous effort” to
which he referred was a four
stage evaluation program in
which 63 persons participated.

Pitt Players To Present ‘Everyman’

Pitt players will perform the
morality play "Everyman” at
Gateway Plaza tomorrow at 8 p.m.
for the Pittsburgh'Arts Festival,
and a repeat performance on the

lawn between the Cathedral and
Heinz Chapel Thursday at 7:30
p.m.

Morality plays, written mostly
in the late middle ages, were
sponsored by the church as topical
lessons in behavior. Many of them
developed from Bible stories and
were the, only theatrical per-
formances presented in Europe at
that time.

“Everyman” will be staged on
the University lawn at dusk be-
cause the natural lighting em-
phasizes the moral of the play
and makes the setting more effec-
tive. i

This is the second annual mor-
ality play that the *7 ayers have
performed. The last’ play was the
“Second Shepherd’s Play.”

If it rains on Thursday, the
performance will be held in

took place about three weeks
after he returned to the United

“The transcript was drawn up
by the station manager before

view with me. I was asked what

What the
transcript said was that my an-
swer was that we were Commu-
nists.‘ What I actually said was
that we were anti-Fascists.”

Dr. Colodny was sabpenaed
several months -ago by the
HUAC. The ﬁve hours of testi-
mony given by him last Thurs-
days involved almost a complete
biographical examination of his
life and the organizations he has
joined, (according to a news re-
port in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.) I

pertinent,” he added, “or where I
thought that it was beyond the

committee’s scope, I declined to.

he ‘had answered most of the com-
mittee’s questions.

The radio transcript has been
quoted by State Rep. John T.
Walsh, who accused him of pro-
Communist views in the Pennsyl-
vania House of Representatives.
This charge led to an investiga-
tion, by the University, a report
of which has been recently given
to Chancellor Litchﬁeld.

Hits in 1 1th

’To Win 4-3

Pitt’s weekend contest with

twist—the Panther’s weren’t
out of the running as soon as
they broke from the starting
blocks in the dugout.

“It hurt just the same,” Coach;

Bobby Lewis conﬁded. “It was‘
just likr: a Hitchcock thriller, only
I don’t know whether or not the
ending was inevitable or suspense-
ful.”

As it was the Cats crawled home
from Meadville once again with
their tails dragging between their
legs. The Pitt nine led only once,
at 1-0, and that margin would re-

quire : better stopper than the .

leaky pitching staff could ever
muster.
Club The Dean

In the fourth inning the Gators
jumped on starter Ralph Shutterly
for three runs and the dean of the
Pitt staﬁ made a quick exit. iHe
has failed to make a curtain bow
yet this season.

I came Jim (No-Hit) Sylvis,
who hasn’t won since he gained
mound fame with his one mas-
terful outing. His mates got him
the honor of being the pitcher
of record when they rallied for
three runs in the eighth inning,
right after the winners had add-
ed another run to their count.

Winning pitcher Bill Hadﬁeld
carried across the deciding tally as
Clenn Beckert singled in the 11th
inning.

Surprisingly, Captain Jerry Ma-
tulevic, who was supposed to have
been out of action for the season
with a broken jaw, returned to
play. He went 0 for 5 and the
Cat’s record slid to 4-9. He left
the ﬁeld, his jaw aching more than
ever.
