Readership program falters

Amy Friedenberger
Staff Writer

Money issues and a lack of interest‘

might prevent Pitt’s Student Govem-
ment Board from bringing printed
copies of The New York Times and
USA Today to campus.

Board President Charlie Shull has
been negotiating with other student
leaders to try and bring the publi-
cations back to Pitt permanently
through the Collegiate Readership
Program. ‘

The Board will discuss a-revised
proposal atTuesday night’s SGB meet-

ing. Shull said the new proposal would
cost $30,000 and bring300 issues of
each publication to campus during the
work week.

The original proposal would have
cost $60,000 for two semesters and
brought 500 issues of each publica-
tion to campus Monday through Fri-
day. Shull said the Board found the
original proposal too expensive.

Both proposals would pay for the
program through the student activi-
ties fund. Every Pitt undergrad pays
an $80-per—term Student Acﬁvities
Fee.

Students have split feelings about

the program.

Sophomore Jeff Davis said he
wouldn’t support the program be-
cause “nobody reads the newspapers
anyway.”

“I don’t read the paper, so that’s $3
I don’t really think I should spend. I’m
against it,” he said. A

Freshmanjake Lewit said he would
support the program.

“I’m from New York, so I would
deﬁnitely like to see the paper here in
Oakland,” Lewit said. “You can’t beat
their sports section.”

Fellow freshman William Bodo
disagreed. »

“I wouldn’t say it’s an appropri-
ate use of student money,” Bodo said.

“With technology today, newspapers
are dying.”

The Collegiate Readership Pro-
gram, developed by Penn State Uni-
versity’s President Graham Spanier
in 1997, has had success at other uni-
versities and currently reaches about
500 campuses nationwide. .

This is not the first time Pitt has
considered joining the program. A
free one—month trial ranfrom March
to April in 2007. Although Shull said
the programwaswell—receiVed by stu-
dents on campus, fully implementing
the program would require adding
an additional $2.50 to the Student
Activities Fee.

Asylum
photos at
Pitt

Gretchen Andersen
Stajf Writer

The 427 suitcases found in the
dusty attic of the Willard Psychi-
atric Center carry more than just
their weight.

Filled with mementos, letters,
postcards, pictures and more, the
suitcases —~ discovered in 1995 —
hold memories of the many patients
admitted to the asylum in upstate
New York.

In connection with the Willard
Suitcase Exhibit, Matthew Murray,
the photographer of abandone-
darnerica.org, lectured at the Frick
Fine Arts Building last night about
what the patients went through
while imprisoned.

Murray also presented his own
work featuring abandoned asylums.
Pictures of dated, Worn- down insti-
tutions similar to asylums dressed
the walls.

One photograph, entitled “the

way of the future,” showcased what‘

seemed to be a dilapidated bathing
area, with paint- chipped walls adj a-
cent to a pearl-white bathtub.

Murray talked about the grue-
some treatments and surgeries
for mental illness throughout his-
tory.

He acknowledged that his work
is a bit different from that of tra-

ditional photographers because it

takes him to run-down factories,

0 asylums, shipyards, and mills. He»

said he is trying to get to the asy-

lums before they are demolished.
“You are losing architecture,-

history and opportunity to know
the past,” Murray said. .

3 Rachel Freund, director of com-
munity outreach for Mental Health
America in Allegheny County, had
been working on bringing the ex-

hibit to Pittsburgh for three years
- and helped organize the event. She

met Murray about three years ago
while in Harrisburg and liked his
work. .

The program fell through afteran
SGB—sponsored vote on the subject did
not draw enough students to count.

Shull said aNew York Times repre-
sentative approached him last spring
about reintroducingthe program. The
Board then discussed the idea during
the summer.

“I think this program is going to
give Pitt students an opportunity to
be more globally aware and give stu-
dents aperspective into a higher level
of journalism,” Shull said.

After getting the idea from a col-
umn on Pitt student Giles Howard’s
online blog, Shull approached the Pitt
Program Council about splitting the
cost ofthe program. -

. The Pitt Program Council receives
$813,000 from SGB — 38 percent of
the total amassed from the Student

Activities Fee — and Shull said he ,

found this program to be in line with
the sort ofprogramsthatPittPr0gram
Council already puts money toward.

“Our executive board said it was
out of the scope of our organization,”
said Kyle Miller, executive board di-
rector for PPC.

Shullis expec1]'nganofﬁcialmem—

orandum from Miller by the end of
the week about why Pitt Program
Council chose not to co—sponsor the
program. -

“We also did notthink600 news-
paper copies was an adequate use of
our money from 17,000 students’
money,” Miller said.

All display, delivery and recycling
services will be provided under the
Collegiate Readership Program

Any issues not picked up are not
paid for, makingthe program onlyas
expensive as it is popular, Shull said.
Moneyfrom newspapers not paid for
would be distributed back into the
student activities ﬁmd.

Distribution racks will be set
around campus, equipped with a
machine to swipe student cards that
open the racks.

The racks will also display an ad-
vertisementforwhomeverpurchases
the program, Shull said. Hehadhoped
the 24/7 advertising would have con-
vinced PPC to join in.

In addition to the 600 newspapers
per day, the program package also
includes supplemental events and a
lecturer who would stay on campus

for the‘day. Shull, in consultation
with representatives with The New
York Times, said he would be able
to guarantee The New York Times’
White House correspondent “at the
very leas ”

“In tandemwiththe papers, bring-
ingahigh-proﬁlejournalistwould be
good for our students who wanted
to pursue something in journalism
but are doing something right now
in English or communications,” Shull
said, addressing Pitt’s elimination of
the journalism major.

The package also includes avariety
of otherworkshops and events based
on what is in the news.

“My concerns are whether we are
moving forward with technology in
the right way and if it will affect stu-
dents negatively,” Shull said: “And in
my opinion, it won’ ” .

In order to keep up with technol-
ogy, The New York Times will start

THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID

Airwave values best
not judged by FCC  

In light of a recent court case, the Commission should really give up.

  

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

The time to stand up for vulgarity
is now. That’s right —— for vulgarity,

. not against it.

Back in July, a federal appeals
court struck downaFederal Commu-
nications Commission policy on in-
decency, according to The NewYork
Times. New York’s Second Circuit
Court of Appeals said that regulations
against certain expletives on radio
and TV violated the First Amend-
ment because they were “vague and
could inhibit free speec ”

The FCC’s list of obscene words
read like middle school graﬂiti on
a bathroom stall. Piss, asshole, tit,
goddamn and shit or bullshit could
not be said at any time. Neither could
the c- or f-words. Ass, however; could

be said duringthe safe harbor period
between 10 p.m. and 6 am. —— per-
haps because the term conveys less
speciﬁc, less disgusting images than
related words like asshole.

The FCC’s primary reason for im-
posingthe regulations wasto protect
children. It’s doubtful that the regula-
tions will go away — the decision is
expected to be appealed to the Su-
preme Court. Althoughithe moral
implications behind censorship are
valid, the indecency policy was al-
ways conﬁising and out of touch with
a culture in which certain expletives
are growing more and more socially
acceptable. ,

The FCC stipulated that one
couldn’t say bastard before 10 or

‘after 6, but bitch is fair game at any

time —- because heaven knows it’s
justwrongto suggestamanwas born

out of wedlock, but it’s okay to com- a

pare a woman to a dog in heat.

In 1973, the Miller v. California
Supreme Court case established the
Millertestfor decidingwhat material
is considered obscene and is there-

‘fore unprotected by the First Amend-

ment. The FCC follows these prin-
ciples in determining which words
are OK and which are prohibited. The
Miller test involves three criteria for
material to be considered obscene: It
must violate community standards
for the “average person,” have no se-
rious value and appeal exclusively
to prurient interests. Describing
something as prurient indicates that
it implies a morbid, degrading and
unhealthy interest in sex.

With the Millertest as abasis, the
_ FCC decided that piss and shit are .
too offensive for the human ear but

Throughout history, there have been
a few ideas and inventions that seem
to have shaped society so deeply that
their consequences are still visible to-

day. The discovery ofﬁre, the invention

of the wheel, all the way to the rise of
the internal combustion engine pro-

_vide such examples. Though centmies

have passed since their inception, these

inventions are still at the root of our
society and culture.

More recent society-changing in-
ventions have taken the shape of the
soda can,,blue jeans and the personal
computer. Butthese have been around
for a generation or more. So it is aper-
fect time to ask, what-is_the'invent1'on”

thatwill deﬁne society and ourcultiire 

today? What’s that one idea which has
becomeareﬂection of our attitude and,

assuch,hasthorouglily ingrained itself
in our daily routines?

I’ll venture a guess and cast my vote
for the USB protocol for data transfer
and power. Universal Serial Bus is a
speciﬁcation for communication be-
tween a device and a host, usually the
personal computer: Itwas co—irivented
by Ajay Bhatt of Intel, the guy repre-

-sented in that snazzy TV ad of theirs.

It has become the standard inter-
face, replacing other communication
protocols like the serial and parallel
ports. Many everyday peripheral devic-
esoperate onti1eUSB standard, suchas
computer mice, keyboards, ﬂash drives

. and routers. Additionally, most digital

cameras, printers and external hard
drives have adopted the standard.
Thesearealldevices thatyouprob—

ably own. You likely use the USB stan— '

dard every single daywithoutrealizing

,l.t.

 “Another  USB platform is the
smartphone. Most smartphones have
adopted USB for data transfer and for
chargingthe battery. In late 2006 the
Chinese government demanded all

mobile phones manufactured there-
after use USB for charging, according
to softpediacom, a site that indexes
technology news and information and
hosts free software.

Inearly2009, 17 mobile companies
did the same. According to PC Maga-
zine, the companies, including AT&T,

marketand moretliantwo billion ship

Besides the numbers, whatelsecan
we learn from this interface’s success?
Well, we can realize much about our-
selves as a society. The USB is a direct
reﬂectionofwhat consumers haveval—
ued for decades: convenience.

You likely use the USB standard
every single day without realizing it.

LG and T—Mobile, adopted a form of

bile phones manufactured. Depending
on when you boughtyour own phone,
the results of the shift could be sitting

FCC uses arbitrary methodsto form censorship rules

i Christensen 4 4

vulgar penis talk, using slang to de-
scribe nipples is just wrong. S you
can forget about cute little phrases
such as “tit—for-tat” and mentioning
that endearing woodland creature,
the titmouse.

Seriouslythough, the FCC isn’t
indicating that it is socially unac-
ceptable to talk about the body, it’s
just monitoring the language which
broadcasters can use. Like ‘a prudish

little girl who hates the way “panties” l

sounds, the organization wrinkles its
nose at some words while expressing
indifference toward others.

If one of the criteria constituting
obscenity is a violation of commu-
nity standards, why are fag, faggot

and dyke permissible duringthe safe
harbor period? As a woman, I can’t
really say I’m particularly offended
by someone saying “tit” instead of
“nipple.” Slurs, however, are offen-
sive and really don’t offer any “seri-
ous value” to the airwaves. Judging
from the uproar springing from Mel
Gibson’s use of the n-word, slurs are
offensive to the “average” American.
Yet the FCC regulations neglected to
"mention racial slurs — the n—word
is not categorized as either obscene
or indecent. ‘ '
What the FCC censorship boils

down to is a system built upon faulty
deﬁnitions. Material is considered
indecent when it contains “patently

offensive sexual and excretory refer-

V ences.” But ordinarywords can refer-

ence gross and unpleasant things too.

.Only 13 words make the FCC’s lists_.

Surely the English language contains
a multitude of sexually offensive or
excretory references. If the FCC is

going‘ to censor, it has to do better

than that.

__ The only way the FCC could logi-
cally regulate what is said over the
airwaves would be by creating some
sort of ultimatum and classifying all
offensive words as off limits. This
is impossible. The court accurately
evaluated that the FCC’s list is consti-
tutionally vague and that the regula-
tions violate standards of p rotective

speech. Putting the constitutional
right to free speech aside for a mo-
ment, it’s too diﬂictilt to determine
which words are offensive to the
American community as a whole.
Radio listeners and television view-
ers are likely to be offended whether
they hear a curse word or not. Not
being able to sayacertainword when

expressing ‘an opinion will not stop ‘

someone from saying something
controversial. Controversy is the
basis of entertainment.

The other option for the FCC
would be to open the airwaves com- «
pletely and do away with censorship
altogether, relying onbroadcasters’
good sense when it comes to curs-

ing, racial epithets or slurs. The FCC

strengthened censorship require- ,

merits afterjanetjackson bared tit (I
said ._it) and celebrities such as Cher
and Paris’ Hilton used expletives dur-
ing award shows. '

It’s obvious that broadcasters
won’t always show good sense, but
the community might — why not
let the viewers make a stirwhen their
personal standards are violated?
By letting the community make its
own criteria for olfensiveness rather
than setting standards for them, the
FCC would save itselffrom opening
a twisted can of wortns. The FCC
should do less and trust people to
turn off their own television sets. I

Hear ye, hear ye — Pittsburgh’s fan-
tasy king and queen have opened
their doors to the city once again.
Returning for its fourth year
under new management, the Pitts-

burgh Renaissance Festival is an ‘

annual medieval-themed fair that
combines combat jousting, music,
comedy, games, carnival rides, cos-
tumed performersand a market-
place for handcrafted materials.
“Once you walk through the
front gate, it’s all entertainment,”

tainment

said Jim Paradise _]r., director of
marketing.

Every year the festival acts are
carefully selected to provide the
best entertainment for local resi-
dents. The performers are a mix of
new talent and old favorites.

One memorable act is Cast in
Bronze, a music group started by
Frank DellaPenna of Valley Forge,
Pa. He plays a carillon, a four—ton
medieval instrument made of dif-

ferent sized bells, historically used .'7

for weddings and town events. '7 _
- “I am the Spirit of the Bells,” said
DellaPenna, explaining that carillon

‘players in the past were not seen

while playing their instrument. To
capture the same historical feel, he
wears allblack with a mask, keeping
his facial identity a secret from the
general public. ’

DellaPenna has performed in
medieval—type fairs for almost 15
years. He was recruited to Pitts-
burgh during the Colorado Renais-
sance Festival.

When performing, DellaPenna
plays his bells “as a silent and
masked spirit, which is kind of dif-
ferent than what otherpeople do,”
he said. “I don’t speak, I perform.
I only appear in costume to play

the instrument, and no one knows
me outside of the costume. It’s a
mystical, magical thing.”

Paradise affirmed the unique-
ness of the performance. '

“Cast In Bronze is something
you won’t see anywhere else,” Para-
dise said. “People sit, not laughing,

. but enjoying the sounds that come
‘ from him.” I  ' ‘

“People enjoy the jousts,” Para-
dise said. “It says what we are and

the different entertainment that '

we have.” ,

Bryan Beard, the owner, pro-
ducer and jouster of Noble Cause
Productions, came to the Pittsburgh
Renaissance Festival after Paradise
recruited him from the Colorado
Renaissance Festival. '

Beard rehearses with three
other jousters and their horses
three times a week, ensuring that
the “good guy wins” after each

“We have so many kids coming

CONCERT REVIEW

in tight pants wandered onto the
stage, Iwasn’t too surprised. What
did surprise me was how much I
enjoyed the show. _

I was enthralled by the nine-
piece coalition of indie rock all-

stars. The touring group consisted
of Kevin Drew, Brendan Canning,
Justin Perof_f; Andrew Whiteman,

Charles Spearin, David French,

John McEntire. _
.-As a whole, the band was en-

‘Sam Goldberg, Lisa»Lobsinger and

skinny, disheveled white musicians -

engaged with the audience. And
despite the’ "fact that members
were unshaven and openly admit-
ted to wearing the same clothes
as the day before — and possibly
even the day before that — they
seemed genuinely excited to be in
Pittsburgh and graciously thanked

the audience for coming out to see
them". . ' 1

of old songs, but in my opinion the

~ new material stood out as theﬂbest..

The stage had a cool‘-light set, and 5
there was always someone running .
around switching out guitarsf'?and,,

otherinstruments’. .

‘Throughout’ th
stand-in Lisa Lobsinger of Rev-
erie Sound Revue seemed weirdly
uncomfortable on stage, but when
she sang, it didn’t even matter.
In fact, she gave ‘two of the best

performances of the concert,

e show, ‘Feist

including the ultimate highlight
“All to All,” during which her voice
sounded positively ethereal. She
was so outstanding that for the
makeshift encore, the audience
requested the female-fronted
“Anthems for a Seventeen—Year—
Old.Girl.” I think I actually prefer
Lobsinger to Feist.

Another cool surprise was
the opening band, The Wooden

Birds. Like Broken Social Scene, 4

The Wooden Birds is a supergroup,
composed of members from other
bands. Toward the end of its act,
for example, when the group

played The AmericanAnalog Set’s
“Aaron and Maria,” I realized the
lead singer, Andrew Kenny, was
also the frontman for American
Analog.

Overall, it was a great show,
though the Byham Theater as a
concert venue leaves the audience
at a loss, as listeners can’t quite

ﬁgure out whether to be reﬁned’

culture snobs or just kids at a rock
concert. It’s ‘difficult to feel “rock
’n’ _roll”'under knock-off Renais-

‘sance paintings and miniature
‘ statues of Poseidon.

“They come to be entertained.
Sometimes the bad guy will cheat,
but they always lose in the end. The
good guy is in black and gold, obvi-
ously, as a Steeler tribute, and he
wins every time.”

Beard enjoys traveling with the
crew but also has another invest-
ment in the shows.

“I like being able to present an
idea of chivalry,” he said. “I don’t
say it’s lost, but I say sometimes
it’s forgotten. People living up to

their own code, doing what’s right

and kind —— I think that’s some-
thing that needs to be emphasized
as much as the negative.”

A daily marketplace offers spec-
tators relief from weighty morality
plays. Items sold include pots, art
pieces, jewelry, handmade soaps,
welding, swords and various leather
bags and ornaments.

“It’s not your everyday item that
you’re going to see,” Paradise said
of the marketplace‘. “We need to be

different, and the quality of what we j_

bring in will be appreciated.”

In addition to a diverse product
list, each weekend features a spe-
ciﬁc theme that alters the festival a

little, making each day a little differ-

ent for workers and visitors alike. .

“For us, its having additional
elements to the festival other than
what we do every day to make each
weekend different,” Paradise said.

Paradise cited Wine Revelry
weekend (Sept. 11-12), in which a
variety of local wines are available
for tasting, as one such theme. Oth-

Bryan Beard:

“I don’t want tochange a lot’
because of the quality of what we
have,” Paradise said about the
lineup. “We may bring in two or

The festival has been ongoing
in the Pittsburgh area for about 14
years, according to Paradise, with
one missed year when ownership

indictments to the doorstep of seem-

thisweekend’s home opener against
the New Hampshire Wildcats (1-0),

‘ 3 Saturday at 1 p.m. at Heinz Field.

“There wasn’t anything really on
the tape that you would say could not
be corrected, whether itwas a missed
tackle or mental mistake,” Wannstedt
said. “I think it’s very important for
a football team to understand what
will lose games for you so that you
can understand what wins a game
for you.”

The brunt of the criticism fell on
Sunseri, whose interception to start

Dave Wannstedt:

33-3 victory over Central Connecti-
cut State. ’

“They’re going to run the ball,”
Wannstedt said. “They’re a little more
spread option, quarterback—type
team than what Utah was. They’ll
run a triple-type option.”

Wannstedt noted the impressive
19-calrry, 197-yard effort of Wildcat

sophomore running back Dontra

Peters against Central Connecticut
State. Both of Peters’ touchdown runs
came out ofthe spread-option forma-
tion. Play-action then allowed senior
qiiarterback R.J. Toman to find Chris
Jearmot in the end zone for another
score. _

“Their quarterback is an out-
standing player,” Wannstedt said.
“When you look at his interception-
to—touchdown ratio a year ago -— I
thinkit was 15 touchdowns with
seven interceptions —— that’s out-

 He understands what we’re trying

to get done on offense.

A overtime led to Utah’s game—winning

ﬁeld goal. But considering that he en-
gineered an 11-point fourth-quarter
comeback in a hostile environment
inhis ﬁrst career start, his coach had
to defend his resilient effort.

“I wish there was an. easy way
to get a young quarterback experi-
ence, but there isn’t,” Wannstedt
said. “When he came off after the
interception, he knew exactly what
happened—who hewas lookingfor
ﬁrst and how he had heldthe ball. It
wasn’t that situation where he came
off, looked at yoii and said,‘ ‘What
happened? Where did that guy come

from?’ He understands what we’re ‘

trying to get done on offense.”
Sunseri ﬁnished the game 16-for-
28 for 184 yards, with one touchdown
to go with his interception in the ex-
tra session.
Meanwhile, New Hampshire

‘ doesn’t often have to cope with inter-'

ceptions-—they don’t often pass. The
Wildcats threw the ball just 18 times
in 63 offensive plays in last week’s

standing.”

On Pitt’s side, Dion Lewis ran for
just 33 yards over last week’s ﬁnal
three quarters, as the Utes made the
Heisman-hyped backwork for every
inch between the tackles and wore
him down. He can catch his breath
Saturday, though, if Ray Graham -
who is recovering from a knee injury
—- returns to action.

“We could have played [Gra-
ham against Utah] if we wanted
to,” Wannstedt said. “If he practices

presents itself, we’ll play him this

Although Graham might return

to the ﬁeld, safety Dom DeCicco”— —

who has an injured hamstring — is
listed as day—to—day and may miss
Saturday’s game.

Nonetheless, the long break be-

extra time on the practice ﬁeld.
