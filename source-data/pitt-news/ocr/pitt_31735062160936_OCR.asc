VOLUME E|GHTY—TWO, ISSUE THlRTY—T,H,RE-E_‘

 

By Frances Sansig
Managing Editor

After consulting with universi-

ty officials, the Student Govern-
, ment Board was forced to reject
a request by the Black Action So-
ciety to commission democratic
presidential candidate Jesse Jack-

son to speak as part of the BAS’

annual Black Week.,
The decision was based on the

grounds that paying for a

presidential candidate to lecture
is in violation of Pitt's non-profit
status code, which disallows the
direct or indirect contribution of

-funds to a political candidate.

President Phil Mayer an-
nounced at yesterday's annual
meeting of the SGB: ”The univer-
sity has stated he should not be
paid, but he can speak here.”

According tolvtoyer, a phone
vote of the Board had resulted in
a 5-3 decision to approve tri-
sponsorship withthe BAS and Pitt
Program Council. ”But universi-
ty officials stated‘ it would
jeopardize tax standing,” said
Moyer. -

Monique Sims, chairperson of
the BAS, had originally argued

”Rules are rules. We initially
wanted to bring him in March,

-before he had announced his

candidacy,” said Sims.

Moyer said, ’’It’s unfortunate
that we're not allowed to bring in
a speaker of that magnitude,” and
that he appreciates the universi-
ty’s cooperation regarding the
matter. —

Members of the BAS are await
ing confirmation from Jackson as
to whether he would be willing
to lecture free of charge.

In other SGB businesshtvloyer
reported that he had made’ sever-
al recommendations to the
university senate, including man-
datory internships for all majors,
mandatory computer literacy
courses and the institution of un-
dergraduate advisors.

Therese McFadden reported
that she is currently organizinga

schedule for the Leadership Con-
ference on Nov. 7. She said that

between 75 and 80 students will
be partcipating in the event.

The Pittsburgh Police
received an anonymous call at
6:10 p.m., Monday night,
warning them of a bomb set to
go off in David Lawrence Hall,
according to Sergeant Paul
Donaldson. '

”A woman said that her
boyfriend said he put a bomb
in there,” said Donaldson.

According to Donaldson,
the city police contacted Pitt
campus’ police and evacuated
everyone in David Lawrence

Hall.

Donaldson went on to say
that Pitt and city police
searched the building and did
not find a bomb. ”Apparant|y,
it was a crank call,” he said.
”At 6:40 we decided to let stu-
dents back in the building.”

”We have received a half a
dozen [bomb threats] a year at
the most,” said Walt Waters,
assistant director of Pitt's cam-
pus police. ”We’ve never had
an actual bomb case.”

Waters said the threats are
usually called in from students
or former Pitt employees.

Bombscare forces evacuation

”Back in the '60s we [Pitt
campus police] would receive
a number of bomb calls,”
Waters said. ’’In the last five or
six years, we've had ‘very
few.”

”A lot of buildings down-
town get these [bomb]
threats,” Donaldson said. ’’It
happens a ’ lot more than
reported;

”We follow up on every
bomb threat,” he added. ”|t’s
one in a million that there is
actually a bomb. However,
there's always a possibility.”

Students’ toquestion SGB candidates at open forum,

Tonight, Pitt students will have
the opportunity to ”Meet the
Candidates” — 12 of them —
running for the nine positions
available on the 1988 Student
Government Board.

The event is open to all in-
terested students and will be held
in the William Pitt Union Assem-
bly Room at 6:30 p.m. Students
will be permitted to ask candi-
dates questions about issues with
which they are concerned.

Craig Jackson, a senior major-

ing in business/political science,
is running for president of the
SGB.

He said he believes a success-
ful SGB president ”must be ex-
perienced in student affairs and
have the ability to recognize stu-
dent concerns and problems.”

He said he is best qualified to
serve in this position because of
his ”hands on” experience in
campus activities, which include,

among others, chairmanof the.’_

Student Relations*ir'-Committee, a

standing committee member of
the SGB; a member of the PPC,
and incharge of Public Relations
of the IFC.

Robert A. Reddy is also a
presidential candidate. He is a
senior, majoring in political
science.

PITTSBURGH — An increase

in drug overdoses and possibly

two deaths may have been

‘caused by a shipment of unex-

pectedly potent heroin called
”Blue Thunder," according to
city officials.

_”Someone apparently didn't

that are far too strong for users

 John McMahon said Tuesday.

A In a city where overdoses nor-
mally number four or five a week,

‘paramedics have responded to
'40 overdoses in the past 10 days,
, said Greg Tutsock, a coordinator

I of emergency medical services in

the city. Seven people were treat-
ed Oct. 19, he said.
A _Lab tests are being conducted

 g on two apparent victims of the

 

 

 

 

heroin, police said.
'- The drug takes its name from
the blue thunderbolt on each

'_small white packet.

' said. It is not the first time ”B|ue

Thunder” has been sold in Pitts-
burgh, but the most recent batch

appears to be the most potent.

PITTSBURGH — The parents
of 21 elementary students, who

during a search for a missing
watch, have sued a Beaver
County school district.

”They may not know how to
spell ’Constitution,’ but we're go-
ing to see to it that they at least
understand part "of it," said Rosa
Petties, whose son, Marvin Wil-
son, nine, was among those
searched on Oct. 7.

The suit was filed Monday in

U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh,

by the Greater Pittsburgh Chap-
ter of the American Civil Liberties
Union on behalf of the fourth-
Elementary
School in Midland.

Named besides the Midland

School District in the suit are Wil-
liam Donley, the school's prin-
cipal and school district
superintendent, school nurse Eve-
lyn Chembarsyand two school
secretaries.

According to the suit, the
defendants subjected the chil-
dren, ranging in age from nine to,
eleven, to ”a senseless, degrad-
ing strip search for a watch which
was not lost.’’

But Donley said Monday the
search was conducted ”with a
light touch.”

’’It was done with profession-
alism and great discretion,” he
said. ”It was intended to hurt no
one.”

Parents and the ACLU said the
searchviolated the students’ con-

stitutional rights.

”There is no place in our
schools for strip-searching stu-
dents,” attorney Michael Rosen-
field said.

’’If we feel that's still in our best-

An appeals court Tuesday

In their opinion, the three 3rd

”will cause economic hardship to

pass, and it hurts.

A: Look, no two relationships
are alike, and most of us live
through more than one relation-
ship. And maybe that first one is
not the best, but for everybody it
is memorable, and no other will

DR. RUTH
WESTHEIMER

ever be like it. It takes its place
in your memory as the first feel-
ing your young heart ever had for
another person. You don't forget
that. That doesn't mean you
won't fall in love again, or that
later loves won't prove to be
deeper ones. But each subse-
quent love will be different and
unique.

50 in this new relationship

don't pressure yourself to love or

worry about how sincere you are
to the new boyfriend, because if
you had no liking for him you
wouldn't even go with him. And
don't get into sex with him or
even intimacy until you really do
want to. That would be unfair to
you and to him, too. As for the

.other guy ignoring you, don't

keep knocking yourself out. lg-
nore him back. That is what he
is asking for by treating you in
that immature way.

Q: I am aprofessional enter-
tainer, and I play clubs and
groups in my home area and also
go on tour sometimes. For three
years I have been with a woman
who means a lot to me, but I
keep getting messed up. What
she wants from me would mean
giving up my career.

What she can't understand is
that in my profession I have to
meet a lot of women, and I can't
act cold or hostile when they
come on to me. I don ’t mean that

' I have to go to bed with them, or _

even that this is what most of
them want me to do. /just have
to socialize and act smooth and
amusing. It is part_of the job.
My girlfriend says I haven't
enough time to makelove to her
the way she wants me to, yet still
I have time for all these groupies
and women who mostly just
want to chat with me little. This
complaint is continual when I am
playing local engagements, and
every time I have to go on the
road, we have a major explosion.
Is there any way to persuade her
that I do care for her, or is this
relationship hopeless?

A: If you want to save this rela-
tionship — and I do think you
sound a little detached and com-
placent, though this impression
could be wrong — if you want to

 . save it you must schedule time

for this woman. Otherwise she
will leave you, or you will get

sick of it and leave yourself. I‘

think you have to set time aside
for her and sometimes turndown
an engagement. If you can't ar-
range to do that, and if that
doesn't lower her resentment of
your female fans, it looks as
though you will have to part with
her and find a more understand-

. ing companion.

I would not give up your career
or going on the road. You would

resent that sacrifice too much.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 28, 1987

Bill introduced to monitor crime at colleges

HARRISBURG — A couple
whose daughter was raped and
murdered in her dormitory room
at Lehigh University are turning
to the Pennsylvania legislature to
lift what they call ”a curtain of si-
lence” about campus crime.

With the help of Howard and
Connie Clery of Rosemont, Pa.,
a bill was prepared and in-
troduced Tuesday that would re-
quire universities and colleges to
spell out the number of serious
crimes and the extent of securi-
ty. The Clerys said they knew of
no other similar legislation in the
country.

The legislation, introduced by
Rep. Richard A. McClatchyJr., R-
Montgomery, would require
schools to publish a brochure,
updated annually, with figures on
homicide, assault, rape, robbery
and burglary; a list of the number
of campus police and security
personnel; and answers to 15
security-related questions about
dormitory, alcohol and drug
policies.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

”The vast majority of private
and state colleges and universi-
ties will not divulge their crime
statistics to prospective students
and parents when asked,” Clery
said at a news conference, later
adding, ”What are they hiding?”

The new bill is based on a
brochure the Clerys have deve-
loped and distributed nation-
wide. The brochure lists
security-related questions parents
should ask when they submit
their children's admission appli-
cations.

The Clerys started their drive af-

ter their daughter Jeanne, a

19-year-old, nationally ranked
amateur tennis player, was mur-
dered on April 5, 1986.

Police said another student,
Josoph Henry of Newark, N.J.,
angry at being rejected by a
woman and upset over the loss of
a campus political office, went to
the Stoughton House dormitory
at about 5 a.m. that morning and
looked for an open room. He
found Miss Clery’s door un-

She was beaten and raped; her
throat was slashed with a piece
of broken glass, and she was
strangled, police said.

Henry, 21, was convicted in
April of first—degree murder, rape,
involuntary deviate sexual inter-
course, assault, burglary and rob-
bery and was sentenced to death.
His attorney has appealed.

McClatchy, who said the
Clerys are neighbors and good
friends, said he was deeply
shocked by the murder and won-

-dered how it could have hap-

pened at a the university.

But he said he understood the
reasons better after looking at
what the Clerys’ found.

”One of the best-kept secrets in
the commonwealth, indeed in
the nation, is the crime statistics
and security measures at our col-
leges and universities,” he said.

While parents might assume
campuses are secure, ”the sad
fact is that parents are woefully
uninformed about crimes on
campus and what security
precautions have been taken,”
the lawmaker said.

At the 23 campuses in Pennsyl— :‘ 
vania that did provide statistics, C . -
tor the years 1984-86, there was

one murder, 32 rapes, 13 robber-
ies and 179 aggravated assaults,
the Clerys said.

They partially blamed drug and I

alcohol abuse and lax admission
standards, which fail to question
students about felony con-
victions. . ’

”We hope to keep the pressure
on,” Clery said. "We want to
spread the story. We want to save
lives.’'

The Clerys have filed suit
against, Lehigh charging gross
negligence. ‘ ‘

According to a recent study
at the University of South
Florida, 20 percent of all col-
lege studentssuffer from social
anxiety.

The National Institute of
Mental Health has awarded
$450,000 to Western Psy-
chiatric lnstitute and Clinic to
study social phobia over the
next three years.

The study will be conduct-
ed by Dr. Samuel Turner,
Ph.D., an associate professor
of psychiatry and psychology,
Dr. Rolf Jacob, M.D., an as-
sociate professor of psychiatry
and Dr. Deborah Beidel, a
post-doctoral fellow in clinical
psychology. -

According to Beidel, the
reasearch team will divide

"will be right for them.

$450,000 Grant awarded for
the research of social phobia

subjects into behavior and
drug therapy groups. There
will also be a control group,
which will receive treatment
when the studyis’ over.

”People [subjects] will be
required to undergo an evalu-
tation to see if the program
” said
Be_idel.

Beidel said the treatment is
free to the participants who are
picked for the study. The study
was approved by the Internal
Review Board to do research
on human subjects.

According to Dr. Beidel,
”People who have an unusual
fear avoid situtations that
make them anxious.”

Beidel said that people with
social phobias avoid activities
in which they have to interact
with people in a variety of

different manners. Many of
them are referred to as shy.

”l have patients who have
turned down job promotions
that would have forced them
to make presentations to peo-
ple,” said Beidel.

Beidel said that people who
suffer from social phobia are
uncomfortable around people
of both sexes, but they are es-
pecially uncomfortable
around members of the oppo-
site sex. Some social phobics
can't eat, drink or write when
people are watching them.

”We don't know for sure if
[social phobia] is genetic,”
said Beidel. ”However, it does
seem to run in families.”

WASHINGTON — Soviet For-

t S A eign Minister Eduard A. Shevard-

nadze will come to the United

S " States at the end of the week to

discuss prospects for a superpow-
er summit meeting and an agree-

. S _ ment to ban intermediate-range

nuclear missiles, a U.S. official

« said Tuesday.

The Soviets requested the
meeting between Shevardnadze

-and Secretary of State George P.

Shultz, an official, who demand-
ed anonymity, told The Associat-
ed Press. , V _
He said he could not predict
whether a date for a visit by
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gor-
b_achev would be set then. But,
the official said, ”a scenario for
a summit is developing/"'
Gorbachev told Shultz last Fri-
day in Moscow he was notready
to fix a date for his third round of
talks with President Reagan.
’ But this morning, in Moscow,
U.S. ambassador Jack Matlock
was called in by Shevardnadze,

who told him he wanted to fly to _

Washington for talks at the end
of the week, said the official, who
demanded anonymity. "
”They’re' the ones who asked,"
the official said. ”Our position is
well—known. There is an invita-
tion out there.” ‘

, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed
at their first meeting in 1985 in
Geneva to ' hold back—to-back
summits in 1986 and 1987. But
insteadof coming to Washington
last year the Soviet leader met
with the president in Reykjavik,
Iceland.

When Shevardnadze was here
last month for talks with Reagan

‘I

and Shultz, the two sides agreed
a third summit would be held in
the United States sometime this
fall.

Shultz went to Moscow expect-
ing a date to be set and also to

to visit US for talks

The judge said Gilday had
demonstrated a pattern of dealing
with nations that sponsor terrorist
organizations.

He made headway with the

based defenses.

Philly man guilty of
giving terrorists arms

WASHINGTON — A Philadel-
phia man who pleaded guilty to
conspiring to sell military equip-
ment to Syria was given a prison
term of 20 months to five years
Tuesday by a judge who called it
”very chilling” that the defendant
would deal with supporters o.f ter-
rorism. .

Kevin Gilday, 37, told U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Thomas Penfield Jack-
son that he committed his crime
not because of pro—Arab ideolo-

gy, as the U.S. government has al-_

leged, but because of financial
interests. A -

”My criminality arose out of a
desire to make money, and not
divided loyalty to the United
States,” Gilday said before Jack-
son sentenced him.

But Jackson told Gilday: ’’What
I find chilling, very chilling, is
your willingness to do business

Senate discuses bill
to benefit the elderly

[WASHINGTON — The Senate
worked toward passage Tuesday
of a catastrophic health insurance
bill to protect" America's elderly

against the devastating costs of

serious illness.

Debate leading to votes on a
handful of amendments and the
bill itself came after weeks of
behind-the—scenes negotiations
that gained White House support
for a compromise version that
closely tracks basic provisions of
House-passed legislation, but
contains important
containment provisions for a new
prescription drug benefit.

COSP.

Summer-

Moreover, differences between
the House and Senate versions
made inevitable the need for a
conference committee. to work
out final details.

But the eventual parameters of
the basic benefit and financing
package that eventually will
emerge from those House—Senate
negotiations as well as the vir-
tual certainty that some legisla-
tion will be passed and signed by
President Reagan came into fo-
cus withword that the adminis-
tration supports the compromise.

Both the Senate and House
bills would inject into the Medi-
care program for the first time an
element of so-called progressive
financing a mechanism by
which elderly Americans with
enough income to make them lia-
ble for federal income. taxes
would pay a proportionately larg-

. er-share for the additional catas-

trophic coverage. .
That feature would require a
relative few of the ‘wealthiest
older Americans those with an-
nual incomes ofabout $100,000
a year -to pay a maximum of
$800 each in ‘additional 1988
premiums under the Senate bill.
But the 60 percent of the elder-
ly who now pay no income tax

on summitt

would be charged only a modest
flat premium for the additional
catastrophic coverage about $6
a month under the Senate bill.

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
the Senate Finance Committee
chairman who pushed the Senate
bill to the brink of passage insist-
ed that the Medicare program,
optional under the Senate ver-
sion, will remain a bargain even
for those hit with the highest ad-
ditional premiums.

Both the House and Senate.

bills would include, also for the
first time, an outpatient prescrip-
tion drug benefit under the Medi-
care program.

The scope of that prescription
drug benefit was the major differ-
ence between the House and
Senate versions.

While the House bill would
pay 80.percent of drug costs af-
ter a $500 annual deductible, the
Senate version pending expect-
ed acceptance of a floor amend-
ment to the committee bill
would'pay 80 percent after a
$600 deductible and, even more
significantly, phase in the drug
coverage so that all drugs would
not be covered until 1993.

The Senate version contains a
built-in cost containment meas-

ure by which the additional flat . S

monthly premium to cover the
drug costs could -not exceed
$8.10 in 1993. If the program
proves at that point to be more

expensive than projected, the

secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services
would be authorized to scale
back benefits to keep costs within
the amount of money set aside-

All-ages nightclub opening planned for next term

By Brenda McGuirk

Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board and the Pitt Program Coun-
cil are working together to final-
ly make the all-ages night club in
the William Pitt Union a reality
by the start of the next term.

SGB member Melanie Naro
had originally hoped the club
would be open this week for
Homecoming, but plans are still
not finalized. For the past six
weeks, Naro has been meeting
with Student Activities, PPC and
the Concourse staff to get the club
opened as soon as possible.

The PPC Coffee House Com-
mittee will be incharge of run-

support, I would hope to help the
board function as best it can for
all university students.”

0 Robert Faizon — ’’I think the
SGB should contain everyday stu-
dents who are more representa-
tive of school than the usual
resume hungry people who join
everything justfor the heck of it.”

Why Be A
Do-Gooder?

Quakers are chronic do-
gooders. The government
adopted our scheme for prison
education 100 years after it was
started as Quaker volunteer
work. There was a Quaker
plan for state endowed medi-
cine 250 years before Medicare.
Quakers worked to abolish
slavery 175 years before Aboli-
tion. And the checker—board
pattern of American cities was
originally based on Quaker
town planning, on the principle

of equal shares of daylight for
all.

What started all this?
William Penn said, ‘True Cod-

liness does not turn men out of
the world, but enables them to
live better in it, and excites
their endeavor to mend it.”
Friends are not apologetic
about being do-gooders. They
don't feel that they have to
"justify" helping others in need,
working for a just and fair soci-
ety, or endeavoring to bring
about peace in the world. "Do-
gooding" is serving that of God
in every human. It is a way of

life.

Do you, too, suspect that doing
good is not so bad? If so, per-
haps the beliefs of the Friends
will be useful to you. We have
some quite readable" leaflets

ning the club and booking bands
for it. The SGB will not be direct-
ly in charge of the club as previ-
ously planned. Bringing
entertainment to Pitt is mainly the
PPC’s job, and the club will most
resemble a coffee house in terms
of organization and planning.

Because the Coffee House
House Committee" is the closest
thing to a club committee, it will
take over running the club. ”The
PPC handles programming and
we (SGB) don't, so they have ev-
ery right to be in charge of it,”
said. Naro.

Lori Allen, chairman of the
Coffee House Committee, said
”We’re still trying to get through
the red tape and get the club off

the ground.” Allen said she is
checking into local bands to book
for the club next term, and that
she wants to have live bands one
or two nights a week.

This is the first time the SGB
and PPC have worked together
on a large project like the club.
”|t’s going very well, I hope itwill
continue,” said Naro.

”Everyone involved has a posi-

tive attitude about the club's suc-
cess. I think students need a place
to go. Especially in the winter
when there's not much to do,”
she said. '
Naro has investigated ’the
problems of having the club in
the Union's concourse and talked
to concourse staff about them.

Staging for the bands, dance
areas and places to keep
refreshemnts are some space
problems that must be worked
out. ”We want to get over some
of the constraints of the con-
courses,” she said. As plans for
the club progress, problems are

being worked out, but others're— —

main unsolved.

The SGB Allocations Commit-
tee has agreed to pay for the
club's opening night, according
to'Naro. The committee has not
allocated specific funds for the
club yet. ”Money from the Coffee

House budget may be used after-

the first night, and extra PPC
funds could also be used to pay
the bands and run the club. l

0 Daryl Grecich — ’’If elected,
I will work to the best of my abil-
ity to uphold communication be-
tween the board, student body
and the university adminis-

' tration.”

0 Tanya Jackson — ’’I would
take the different ideas and con-
cerns that they have and present
them to the rest of the board
members for discussion.”

0 Matt Pritt — ”Some things
I would like to see happen here
at Pitt are a continued pursuit of
excellence in the academic and

athletic realms ...” .

0 Pamela Rich — ’’I believe
that a book exchange would pro-
vide more profit to students sell-
ing books and provide less
expense for students buying
books.”

0 Jon Scanlon — ’’I’d like to
see the Union made a place for
students, not a sterile, administra-
tive building. Students need
places to hang out between class-
es, which is why Hillman is so
crowded and noisy.”

If all goes well, Naro and Allen i

want the club to be free to all Pitt
students. If funds get tight, stu-

Because the club will be open _ 

to students of all ages, not just the
under 21 crowd, Naro and Allen
said they believe it should be
promoted as an all—ages dance
club. The fact that alcohol will be"
prohibited may turn students

away, but the organizers feel it ‘

shouldn't.

”This isn't going to be a place I

for underage‘ students to go just
because they can't get into the

Natalie

By Joel Timulak
For The Pitt News

Last Friday, 10,000 Maniacs
wheeled their buses into Pitts-
burgh with the R.E.M. Work
Tour. Backstage before the show,
vocalist Natalie Merchant, in an
interview broadcast on WPTS,
talked about tyranny, maniacs
and Debbie Harry. .

Touring with R.E.M. has given
the band oppurtunities to expand
their audience. They've been ex-
posed to thousands of concert
goers who may find that 10,000
is just theright number maniacs
to make the group special.

Q: Where did you get your
name? .

A: We picked our name from
a book of late—night television
films. It was just to be used for
one evening, actually. It was a

‘Halloween show, ' -

 T 3:’. it? kept-lgon going.

 

 

  

Q: How has your name effect-
ed your image?

A: It's been difficult because
there have been plenty of radio
programmers who've avoided
our albums just on the basis of
our name. And we've always
made a point of making our al-
bum artwork very subtle to coun-
teract the name, but I don't know
if that actually achieves what we
want  that we're not a harmful
band. We're very sober and
(laughs) reasonable people
with an unreasonable name.

Q: Can you tell us what the
band is doing? If a band has a
philosophy, does 10,000 Mani-
acs have one?

A: No, I wouldn't say we have

a group philosophy. There's cer-
tain patterns in our ideology that 1

intersect between us,-but we're

very distinct ind_ividu‘als1.Some- -

Learning to fight for a free press

  

GOODMAN

It was a week of public atten-
tion focused on the shouting
match between the senators and
the sore losers. A full—scale dra-
ma on Capitol Hill.

But at the Supreme Court, life
and law went on as usual. A dis-
pute between students and their
school principal came before the
eight sitting justices, and not a
word was said about the empty
seat.

The case on the docket last
week began on publication day

I E . in May, 1983, at Hazelwood East

High School near St. Louis. Jour-
nalism students picked up the
newspaper they worked on and
discovered that two articles had
been deleted. One was about

_ teenage pregnancy; the other was

about teenage reaction to
divorce. Both had been spiked by

the principal. -

The principal described the ar-

ticles as "inappropriate, personal,

sensitive and unsuitable.” The
newspaper, he claimed, was part
of school curriculum. He was its

A final editor.

 ‘ed that they were not just stu- ‘

 

But three staff members insist-

dents. They were also journalists.
The Spectrum in turn was not just

ta-slassrproiect: it was as
     J

E|.I.Eihll

  

declared a commitment to the
First Amendment.

So the question that came be-
fore the Supreme Court was this:
How much of a right to free
speech does a student have? How
many rights do we grant high-
schoolers? How much authority
do we offer institutions over the
young?

There is no pat formula for

balancing these conflicts be—‘

tween students and schools, free-
dom and authority. In 1969, the
heyday of student rights, a majori-
ty of the Court said that a school
couldn't prevent high-school stu-
dents from wearing black arm
bands as a form of political ex-
pression. But two years ago, the
Court said that schools could sus-
pend a student for using lewd im-
ages in a campaign speech.

Now, listening to the Hazel-
wood case, justices appeared un-
comfortable with both sides.
When the school's lawyer said
that the principal had the right to
control anything written by stu-
dents, Justice Brennan objected:
”That really adds up to no First
Amendment protection.” Should
a school be able to dictate and
censor what students write?

When, in turn, the students’
lawyer said that officials could
never censor a story just because
they didn’t like its viewpoint,
Justice Scalia objected. What if
the students wrote in favor of
marijuana? Didn't the school
have some authority, some
responsibility, for what was
produced in its classroom and
published in its building?

The oral argument was lively,
but neither justice nor lawyer
aired the social concerns that fuel
this debate. Below the surface lies
a deep uncertainty about how to
best prepare our young people

.. 

vforfadulthood. How and when ,
i$.h9i%ild Ari1eriCan...$0.Cietv‘ .tu,rnr
 

 
 
 
  

young?

There are two ways of prepar-
ing people for citizenship in a
democracy, says Martha Minow,

- a Harvard Law School professor

who prepared a brief forthis case.
One is to extend ”a learning per-
mit.” We can let the young, es-
pecially teenagers, exercise their
rights under certain restrictions,
hoping they'll learn by doing.
The other way is to wait until they
achieve ”threshold level of matu-

rity.” Once they cross it, then we‘

give them rights.

Families use both strategies. So
‘do schools. Institutions that both
shelter and shepherd young peo-
ple need enough authority to
teach and guide. They also want
students to get behind the wheel
of their onrushing adulthood.

In the current climate of con-
cern about crime, drugs and dis-
order in schools, the Court has
come increasingly to support the
power of school officials. But
these were not adolescents

careening down ‘the highway
with premature rights to the car.

‘The young editors of the Spec-

trum did nothing to invoke the
principal’s heavy-handed censor-
ship. Quite the contrary.

They used the First Amend-
ment well, with -great maturity.
They did what good journalism is
supposed to do: inform their au-
dience on stories crucial to their
lives. In this case teenage preg-
nancy and divorce.

Indeed, the students have lived
up to the principles in the school
handbook at Hazelwood. There,
it says that a purpose of the paper
is to teach students about the
values of a free press. On the long
trip to the Supreme Court, these
citizens in training_learned some-
thingelse about a free press. You
have to fight for it.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 28, I987

It's getting a bit drafty in here, no?

 

MA'l"l'l-IEW.«
THORNTON

It was raining yesterday. Did
you ever notice that when the
weather's good, people are hap-
pier and.less convinced that the
world is in conspiracy against
them? Beauty, then, must be at
least related to our perception of
truth.

that's not what I came here to talk
about. I came to talk about the
draft. I

I registered for the draft. I was
a little late by a couple of years,
but I did register. Really.

As a result of that, a lot of things
in the news lately have been
bothering me. The leaders in Iran
have been busy' convincing their
people that thereis going to be

t a war with the United States. The

Iranian population.has been told

But, as a folksinger once said,‘

the Americans started a war, and
they had better be ready to deal
with it.

Our intrepid president, mean-
while, dismisses the threat-of war
with Iran with a wave and a
mumbled line about the stupidi-
ty of such a move. Who do you
want to believe?

And so I sit, watching the
papers, counting the days until
I'm no longer eligible for the
draft. Eligible, that's a funny way
to talk about it. As if it were some
sort of contest, as if there were
winners.

I suppose it's just paranoia. I
have whatl consider a healthy
aversion to war. I don't trust any-
thing with such an incredible
record for killing people.

I guess what bothers me most
about my draft registration is that

'I’ve signed up to fight "for

whatever I'm toldis important.

Shouldthe president decide that '

a warwith Iran is a rational -way
to execute foreign policy, I'll
have to defend that if I want to
stay within the law. ‘

As I see them, myalternatives
are limited. I can refuse to sign
up, in which case I'll be incarcer-
ated. I can object to the draft and
refuse to go, in which case I'll be
incarcerated. Ican go and refuse
to kill people, in which case, you
guessed it._ 

’ I kill people without a war, and

I go to jail. I kill people because

the _president of my country
doesn't like what the president of
their country has to say, and I'm
a hero. Does any of this make any
sense, especially in one nation
under God? As I recall the fifth
commandment, killing produces
some serious problems for any
person claiming any kinship with
its author. W
Killing is illegal, unless it's

sanctioned by the government. I .

assume that means you have to
have agood reason to kill, as if
such reasons exist.

The way I look at it, I haven't
registered for induction to the
service. I've merely applied for a

permit to shoot people, or to con- .

tribute in some significant way to

the shooting of people. My num-_

ber comes up, I am issued a gun,
shown how to use it, told the
direction in which to pointit and
sent merrily on my way to hell.

But, I'm told, there are times
when we have to fight to-protect
our liberty.-We have to take up
arms and defend ourselves
against people seeking to deny us
our right to life and the pursuit of

happiness. I am told that I’l|~make .

the world of my children better
by killing offsome of its inhabi-
tants today. a ‘

I have a hard time seeing the

sense in that. If I kill a person, any‘

person, I have made a. decision

that my life is more important-

than his, that I am more eligible

I 3

to breathe than he. I wonder why
my birthright and my country's
ideology entitles me to such pow-
er over others.

War has had ‘a long history of I

Buried beneath a lack of attention

LETTERS

The Pitt News, to its credit,
does not shy away from publish-
controversial views.
However, it seems to give pre-
cious little care either to selecting
staff writers who have any real
command of standard written En-
glish or, failing that, to producing
a paper with at least the appear-
ance of having been proofread by
a reasonable articulate person.

The work of James Crary is a
case in point. The theme of his
column of Sept. 23 seems to be
the paramount importance of hu-
man rights. That theme gets my
hearty approval, but its tortuous
and muddled expression expres-
sion is hardly worthy of a’ high
school student let alone a jour-
nalist.VCrary suggests that "peace
of mind" and "privacy in their
homes" are absolute human

4 rights. Well, lighten up, James! It

is you, just as much as "Ameri-
can statesmen,” who have failed
to study history‘ and constitution-
al law. It is hard to imagine an ab-
solute human right to peace of
mind, especially in a society
whose democratic nature de-
pends on the unfettered, and
often unsettling, exchange of con-
flicting ideas.‘ And even crucial

rights must be tempered on occ_a- .

sion, as whena defendent's right
to a fair, trial may override" a
newspaper's right to report on

that trial, or when asociety's_rigl1,t..=,~
té: aAaprqiterlv-o.btaisn€d§‘  

 

pect's right to privacy in his or her
home. Uninformend maundering
about "absolute rights does not
enhance our precious human
rights — it cheapens and en-
dangers them. And, it makes for
rather poor reading.

Crary also tells us of his father's
name, occupation, employer,
number .of marriages and the
date, title and non-pioneering na-

ture of his "first work." The elder"

Crary must have been a vital, in-
teresting and accomplished in-
dividual. He would also, I think,
be disappointed that his son

would choose to inject so much‘

biographical detail into a writing
without even the slightest indica-
tion of how that detail was rele-
vant to the writing. I -. - V
On Sept. 28, two of Mr. Crary's
pieces appeared along with an
Editor's Note that they were be-
ing featured together because of
their "similar subject matter."
Perhapsthe editor was sharing
with the readers a subtle jokerat

‘the columnist's expense, inas-

much as the only apparent
similarity between the subject
matter of one piece and that of
the other was that both were in-
discernable. The first piece at-
tempts to sing the priases of a
local company (Artel‘<),’ yet it
quickly chokes on the likesof

("We can't even build prisons fast
enough. That, incidentally, is the
real reason the Military-Industrial
Complex is desperately trying to
whip up a war.") and some in-
crediblygakward phrasings, the

piece ends, mercifully. It is fol-

lowed by something aptly titled
"Stop, making sense," wherein
Mr. Crary, apparently heeding
that invocation, employs slogans
and sentence fragments in pursuit
of a theme which may yet be
clear only to himself and God. I
do not question the‘ legitimacy of
such free verse as an. art form,
only the appropriateness of print-
ing it as a "column” on the
editorial page.- ' ‘

Mr. Crary's eruptions constitute
only a small example of the slop-
piness evident in The Pitt News.
On Oct. 12, an editorial identi-.

fied the United States as having

one third of the wor’|d'smpopuIa-
tion‘, an asse_rta,tion which might
come as a surprise to the approx-
imately one billion people of Chi-

na. Was it colossal ignorance of '
-world demography, or merely

careless writing combined with
indifferent editing? '

Upon opening almost any issue i
of the paper, the ‘reader is con-.

fronted with an ‘avalanche of mis-

spellings, bad grammer, mindless._

enterprising editor may find er- "

point is the consistent lack of care

R.E./\/I.’s Stipe wears a skirt

Some plagiarized perspec-
tives from last Friday's R.E.M.

1 concert:

I Michael Stipe wore a white
skirt for the first few songs,
making a fashion statement
that didn't state much. Though
he didn't appear decidedly

feminine (even with his hair"

pulled back into a ponytail),
he had a pretty strong likeness
to the ghost of Christmas past.
I I don't know if it was be-
cause of my vantage point, but
both 10,000 Maniacs and
R.E.M. sounded really bassy. I
couldn't distinguish any semb-
lence of lead guitar from
10,000 Maniacs until R.E.M.’s
Peter Buck came on to lend a
hand during their set.

I Stipe also came on to sing
a song he wrote for 10,000
Maniacs, and while his back-

up singing on the album,

sounds great, he just didn't cut
it using the same mike as

Natalie Merchant. She was-

really pumped up, and Mike
came in cold. The end result
was kind of awkward.

I If they could bridle the
energy of 16-year-old females,
we wouldn't have to go to war
in the Middle East over oil sup-
plies. I had the fortune of sit-
ting next to a group of such
girls at the concert, and
received numerous blows to
the left side of my body. They
danced, arms and legs flailing
out at anything that wandered

intotheir path. I guess those
aerobics classes pay off.

I Stipe didn't want to get off
his high horse to enjoy the
music with the audience. Af-

. DAVE
ZAFRIS

ter some stage divers dared to
perform their task, Stipe
waived his arms, stopping the
rest of the band from playing.
He then informed the crowd
that stage diving is a ”very un-
cool thing that went out in
1976.” There weren't any
more. divers, but the crowd
didn't appear to be swayed.
I Did Stipe look like he was
trying to be Bono? Naw,
couldn't be. 1

I For some reason, R.E.M.’s
not the kind of band to shake
your fist at. What I mean by
this is that at Lynryd Skynryd
concerts you expect to see
people shaking their fists in the
air to the beat and screaming,
”Yeeeaah, he's jammin’!”
Some of these people evident-
ly made their way into the Civ-
ic Arena Friday night. The
silliest example that sticks in
my mind is some guy shout-
ing, ”Yeeaah, they're playin’
’Flowers of Guatemala’!” The
guy clad in bandanas and a
muscle t-shirt behind him re-

plied with great fervor,
”Yeeaah! Guatemala!”

I I can safely say that I've
never yelled, ”Yeeaah,
Guatemala,” and i don't think
I've ever heard anyone else ut-
ter those words. it just sounds
kind of strange.

I It looked like Bill Berry,
R.E.M.’s drummer, was prob-
ably the most comfortable in

the Civic Arena. He was wear-_

ing boxer shorts and a t-shirt.
Maybe everyone was too em-
barassed to tell him that he for-
got to put on pants.

I Stipe whipped up the
crowd into a frenzy with his
intellectual nuances. One of
which was the suggestion,
”Don’t patronize Budweiser
and Miller beers because they
suck!” The crowd screamed
their approval.

I Stipe could have said any-
thing sucked and the crowd
would've screamed their ap-
proval. ~

I Stipe did have several
poetic introductions, but he
missed the boat on ”The One
I Love." He said he wrote it for
himself.

I It's shocking, I know. ”The
One I Love” broke into the
Top 40 this week as the
highest debut at number 34.
I The real party was held af-
ter the show. R.E.M. showed
up atthe ”After R.E.M.” party
at Graffiti and played ”Gloria”
with The Cynics.

The Clarks thrive on
straight—out rock

By Joan Kane
For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh's music scene is
changing. Guitars and drums are
replacing the keyboards and syn-
thesizers as the happening instru-
ments. The Clarks are one of the
local bands influential in making
this change.

Originally hailing from Indiana
University of Pennsylvania, The
Clarks have recently brought their
energetic and firey music to the
Pittsburgh area. According to
lead singer/guitarist Scott Blasey
(alias Phydo), the band had pret-
ty much conquered what was to

’ be conquered in Indiana, Pa. -

the two existing bars.
”Pittsburgh was the next logi-

cal step for the band,” he said. .

Along with Phydo, The Clarks
members are Rob Hertweck (gui-

tar), Dave Minarik (drummer) and"

Greg ”Chief” Joseph (bassist).
The band formed a little over
a year ago and is happy with their
progress thus far. For them, it's
been a series of progressions with
no major setbacks. They started

- out playing at fraternity parties,

mostly for free, and now they're
being booked at local clubs such
as Graffiti, the Upstage and
Mirage. Also, plans are being
made for their up and coming EP
tentatively titled ”l’ll Tell You
What Man  ,” a phrase the
group admittedly uses quite fre-
quently. b
It's not money that motivates
these musicians, but rather the

sheer enjoyment of doing some-
thing that they love —— playing
serious rock ’n’ roll. Ultimately,
The Clarks would like to make a
career out of their current hobby.

”We’re not in it for the limou-
sines and cocaine or all the
glamour,” Hertweck explained.
”We're best of friends, like
brothers, and we really enjoy
playing in a band together.”

When Phydo sings ”l’ll trade
you my girlfriend for your guitar,”
he means it. It's their music that's
most important to them.

”We’d trade anything for our

music, even something very close T
to us. Anything except for God,”

Hertweck said. _

This desire to play rock ’n’ roll
manifests itself when The Clarks
play live. The music is fast and
spirited, and their delivery is solid
and sincere, if not always
polished. The band members
successfully convey-their enjoy-
ment to the crowds to which they
play. It is difficult to listen and
watch The Clarks without getting
caught up in their performance.

The Clarks prefer an intimate
setting as opposed to large
arenas.

”l can't see myself wanting to
play for thousands of people sit-
ting way up in nosebleed seats,”
said Minarik.

”But if it does come down to
that, Phydo quickly added, ’’I

If videoman listens to a woman, what's next?  

By John Young and Nancy
Quick

Sure, there are a number of you
out there who are enraged over
the gripey slop I pass off each
week as a column. You're upset,
and you feel as if you have no
voice to represent your views.

Now you do.

Meet Nancy Quick, guest
rebuttalist. She'll be offering a
counterpoint to how I view the
latest videos in this week's
column.

Who says the democratic
process isn't working?

Debbie Gibson —— ’’Only In My
Dreams"

Here's a girl who's pretty bright
despite being only 18. She knows
already that if you set up a bed
on a beach and sing mushy, goo-
goo disco you're bound to find
M_r. Right. Hell, I'd think twice if
after some sweaty volleyball, a
good ‘swim and a few beers I
found a spritely pseudo-waif be-
fore me on the sand.

Once I heard this Gibson gal

- sing, though, I think I'd be run-

ning for higher ground.
Nancy: I agree, /ohn. Despite
her wholesome good looks and

 

sweet singing voice, Debbie Gib-

son is an idiot.

That's just what her promoters
want her to be, and that’s what
appeals to Mr. Sweaty-Volleyball-
Beer-Lover.

Obviously the man who direct-

ed Debbie’s first video knew’

what he was doing when he
filmed heron a brass bed in her
silk pajamas on the beach: Help-
less Female Awaits Shining
Knight Of Her Dreams. What bet-
ter way to exploit females than to
show one who has nothing bet-
ter to do than to lie around in her
silk pajamas and sing about how
much improved her life would be
if there was a man in it.

Oh well, some of us have bet-
ter things to do. And if Gibson
ever shakes her exploitative
promotional staff and approaches
her art seriously, we might find
she does, too.

But I doubt it.

Loverboy — ”Notorious”

Only one of the femme fatales
in this thrill-a-minute clip had on
a ”Savoir Faire” t-shirt, but I think
every one would ”know what to

do.” Whether you'd have an es-

pecially sordid social disease the
next day,_ however, is another
matter entirely.

Not that I believe anything I see
in videos, but if there are any la-
dies out there with phone booth
fetishes like the one depicted in
the ”Notorious” video, my mind
can be changed.

Nancy: This video is not funny,
/ohn.

It's degrading.

You probably find women be-
ing portrayed as objects for male
sexual fantasies exciting. Heaven
forbid a video should ever por-
tray a woman as anything more
than that.

And besides, it doesn't matter
that every 13-year-old girl in
America is out combing her local
Lerner Shop for a ”5avoir Faire”
t—shirt. its just a video, right?

just a video. HA! This piece of
sexual subversion is so visually
abusive, I can't even remember

how the song goes.

And judging by your vivid
recollection of the woman in the
phone booth, john, neitherlcan
you.

John Cougar Mellencamp —
”Paper In Fire"

It's good to see John getting
back to his roots in black Ap-
palachian society with this video.

Actually, if you can get past his
down home on the dirt road im-
aginings, Mel lencamp has a pret,-,
ty good rockin’ folk song here.
Cute lady in his band, too.

Sorry, Nancy, I just couldn't
resist making that last comment.

Nancy: Oh come on, /ohn. If
john Mellencamp has any roots
to get back to, they're with some
girl who knows the meaning of,

 

”Hey, hit the highway.”.

I see his latest work as a great
departure. Anyone who can uti-
lize a dulcimer and a fiddle and

still pump out a serious piece of

rock ’n’ roll gets my vote.

The video gets my vote, too._' ’

reaching symbolism. lust /Olin

their hair grow, playing among a

The song is good enough‘ to '

carry the video. That's the way it
should be. A »

And yes, john, Lisa Germano,

you refer, is very cute. She's also
a fine instrumentalist.

The Great Gatsby premieres

I

A scene from ballet choreographer Andre Prokovsky’s The Great Gatsby.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 28, l987

at Benedum Center

By Cathleen Karlsson
For The Pitt News

The atmosphere at Benedum
Center Thursday, October 22,
was unmistakeably that of excite-
ment and anticipation as Pitts-
burgh Ballet Theatre marked the
beginning of its 1987-88 season
with the world premiere perfor-
mance of The Great Gatsby. It is
a new ballet commissioned by
the company from‘ Andre
Prokovsky, an internationally-
acclaimed choreographer. To
help set the scene, Seventh
Avenue was decorated in ’’Jazz
Age” style with four cars of the
era and a quartet accompanied
by lively members of the au-
dience dancing the Charleston
before the ballet. Some of the
guests were adorned in 1920’s
fashions to commemorate the
special occasion which has
caught national recognition.

The air about the theatre re-
mained unsettled--the audience
stirring in their seats—until the
lights slowly began to dim, and
famed conductor/composer Gun-
ther Schuller signaled the orches-
tra to begin the overture. The
musical score consisted of his
original music, as well as that of
Duke Ellington, George Gersh-
win, and Scott Joplin. And, with
the final note of the prelude, ap-
plause overtook the audience as
the curtain was raised for the first
of four sold-out houses.

The ballet began with a
prologue--a spectacular upbeat
dance expressing the gaity of the
almost—nightly parties held at the
Gatsby mansion. This routine

was repeated a number of times
throughout the ballet which
helped to emphasize the repeti-
tion of the nightly parties and the
frivolous mood of the era. It also
helped to connect the acts of the
story by showing the passage of
time. This routine was used again
as the finale, following the death
of Gatsby. Using it this way not
only expressed the continuance
of the others’ lives, but it was also
an emotional indication of Gats-
by’s desolate life-—left behind.

The lead roles of Daisy Bucha-
nan and Jay Gatsby were por-
trayed by Janet Popeleski and
Scott Jovovich. The choreography
of Popeleski’s light-hearted,
flauncy dances effectively
represented the giddiness of
Daisy, just as the romantic es-
sence of Gatsby was exhibited in
Jovovich’s dances.

Other memorable roles were
those of Myrtle and George Wil-
son (portrayed by Jennifer Davis
and Carlton Paynter,) and Jordan
Baker and Nick Carraway (Laura
Desiree and Joseph Briggs.) An
impressive scene was that be-
tween Myrtle and Tom Buchanan
(Daisy’s husband played by Bri-
an Bloomquist,) showing the love
affair the two had together. In this

, scene, Desiree executed a slow

leg lift to a seductive musical
piece. This demonstration of con-
trol’ brought applause from the
amazed members of the au-
dience. The more dreamy dances
ofJordan and Nick helped to set
a romantic moodfor the ballet,
differentiating their new-found
love from the chaotic love be-

The’Slap’ Maxwell
story comes to TV

By Kathryn Baker

AP Television Writer

LOS ANGELES — A sign on the
wall of the nondescript, suburban
studio that houses Slap Happy
Productions warns that parking in
the wrong space out front could
elicit a tow by the neighboring
floor store.

This is big-time network televi-

- sion. Come to think of it, though,

nextdoor to Tile World is not
such an unlikely place for Jay
Tarses to make his un-Hollywood
comedy, The ”Slap” Maxwell
Story, for ABC.

On a soundstage in the rear of
the building, actors Dabney Cole-
man and Susan Anspach rehearse
a scene, a bit of physical come-
dy involving a flubbed hand-off
of a suitcase.

Tarses is directing — or rather,
at the moment, watching. He
stands patiently to the side while
the actors try to work out the

' timing.

_ Coleman plays ”Slap” Max-
well, an old—school sports colum-
nist. Anspach plays his estranged
wife.

After watching them struggle
for a while, Tarses decides to just
shoot it.

' Several takes later, he suggests
to the guy with the clapboard,
”Don’t call it seven. It's ‘another
take.’ ”

The actors take a break. They'll
try again later.

Tarses goes back to his office to
talk for a bit about ”Slap” and his
other show, The Days and Nights
of Molly Dodd, on NBC. Molly
completed a successful 13-week
run this summer and will return
midseason. ”Slap” premiered last
week. Both shows are complex
character comedies with touches
of poignancy.

’’I try to get inside of these peo-

Continued from page 16
tween Daisy and Gatsby.

Act II began with a more
modern adaptation of ballet. The
scene, entitled ”The American
Dream,” showed a flashback
depicting Gatsby’s rise to wealth
after the war. While Gatsby
danced on stage expressing his
materialistic expenditures,
another dancer's shadow was
spotlighted on a large screen
backdrop, showing how young
Gatsby acquired his money. To
me, this was the most impressive
and unforgettable moment of the
ballet. The transition in Gatsby’s
life was depicted in such a
unique way as compared to the
other, more flowing dances one

ple’s heads,” Tarses said. ”lt’s just
interesting writing. It's just fun to
write. I mean, jokes aren't fun to
write anymore. Those are "for
nightclub comedians. It's just bet-
ter to write people and the way
they talk to each other, and their
hopes and dreams ...”

”And the hopes and dreams
and everyone’s careers are in-
volved in this particular show,”
interrupts Coleman, who has
come in to rehash the suitcase
scene. He spends about 10
minutes working it out in Tarses’
office.

Tarses did jokes early in his
career, as half of a comedy team
with Tom Patchett, whom he met
in 1956 when they shared an
office in the advertising depart-
ment of the Armstrong Cork Co.
in Lancaster, Pa.

A talk-show appearance with
producer ‘Carl Reiner launched
them into television, writing and
producing such shows as The
Carol Burnett Show, The Bob
Newhart Show, The Mary Show
and Open All Night.

The partnership broke up after
NBC canceled their last series
together, Buffalo Bill, a critics’
favorite that still has a cult fol-
lowing.

Patchett made a comeback last
season with the sweetly sardon-
ic ALF. It wasn't any big surprise
Patchett would do a show starring
a puppet. He and Tarses wrote
two of the Muppet movies.‘

But Tarses turned to adeeper,
—more human comedy with Mol-
ly and now Slap.

Patchett’s show is in its second
season. For Tarses, second sea-
sons are strange, new territory so
far. He says" if he winds up with
two hit shows on television at the
same time, he'll handle it
somehow.

expects from a ballet.

The overtone of The Great
Gatsby was that of a lyrical, ab-
stract perception of a man's des-
troyed dream. The mood was set
not only by the backdrops, set-
tings, and costumes which were
created by noted designer Peter
Farmer, but also by Prokovsky’s
choreography. Prokovsky_ said,
”when you're working with the
dancers and nothing comes...you
do something...just to get going.
And out of that the obvious solu-
tion comes.” It is apparent that
The Great Gatsby, after two years
of being planned and prepared
for, is an extravagant solution to
the question of creating a new, il-
lustrative, fu|l—length ballet.

Lonesome jubilee
Polygram .

Directly after the first down-
beat of the first song of his first
album in two years, John Cou-
gar Mellencamp slams a chord '
of violins, hammer dulcimers

and accordians as incendiary
as the song's title, ”Paper in
Fire.” After a few measures of
these swelling chords and a
musical decrescendo, on

"comes that silken voice with

only the hint of gravel in it tell-
ing the listener all aboutshat-
tered dreams and lost hopes.

tainly not uncommon for the’
man who produced such ’’I ,

what the society we live in did

Houses” and the definitive
song of the 19805 so far, ”Jack
and Diane.” But the difference
with this opus, The Lonesome
jubilee, lies with its own matu-
rity, inherent when analyzed;

Like the traditional Mellen-
camp style, the album has pop
songs on it — ”Rooty Toot

Toot” and ”Cherry Bomb”

each are uncompromising
paeans to a youth spent in
reckless abandon in pool halls
or in the back seats of Chevys

with the girls who would. But.

even though these songs play
as pop, they lack_the nose-

picking lyrics and sometimes '

irritating twang such former
Mellencamp hits such as
”Hurts So Good” or ”Crum-
blin’ Down” possessed.“ In
turn, these songs instead de-

fine the terms of pop to the au- '

dience which listens to .it.
They drive a course directly

The Clarks stick to playing

responsibility for songwriting falls
on the entire band. One member
will bring up an idea, and every-
one will expand on it. Each is

dous. In fact, Dave cited 11th
Hour’s drummer, Jerry Golden-
son, as his hero.

’’If it wasn't for those guys [1 1th
Hour] kicking down a few doors
for us, and actually a lot of bands,
things wouldn't be happening for
us the way they are,” Hertwek
added.

The Clarks are no stranger to
hard work. Their commitment to
the band doesn't begin or end
with their performances. They
must do everything for, them-
selves; they are the rodies and
soundmen. The Clarks handle
their own public relations and
marketing. The guys even hang
their own posters that advertise
their gigs.

’’People don't see the band be-
fore 10 and after two,” Chief said.
”They don't see what else hap-
pens. They just don’t realize how
much time and work goes into
this.”

The Clarks play straight forward
and traditional rock ’n’ roll with
conviction, energy and skill. Is
there really much more to to ask?

Do you like music?-movies? art?
Then YOU should be writing for
the Entertainment Section! Who
knows, you might even like it.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 28, 1987

Continued frog page 17.

into the heart of Heartland,
USA, unceasing and unsway—
able by their sheer passion and
energy. '

And this is true for the entire
album. Like a Francis Coppo-
la with an Apocalypse Now or
an Edward Hopper with a
Night Hawks, Mellencamp
has finally hit the paydirt for
which he has so ardently been
striving and defined his own
masterpiece with The Lone-
some jubilee.

Again, it is the maturity fac-
tor which elevates this album
from the rest. In short, John
Cougar sans Mellencamp has
grown up. The yearning to
return to adolescent yearnings
of American Fool have given
way to a more in-depth analy-
sis of present day results. The
cynical, almost fantastic cut-
downs of the slimy and seamy
America of Uh Huh have
evolved into objectivity in
modern realities, still cynical,
but with a better sharpened
edge of gut truth this time. The
songs on The Lonesome
jubilee take command of
listeners’ viscera instead of just
playing mock empathy with
their minds. They swell not
only in volume but in the
listener's understanding of the
human condition as well.

But, as Count Basieidid with
the sounds of silence in jazz,
the overall effect of these
pieces works best because of
their simplicity. And, subse-

quently, this is basically what

separates Mellencamp’s best

(again, such as ”Jack and Di-

ane” and ”Pink Houses") from

his rest. He doesn't have to
scream his points across like
some other boss relics, nor
does he have to envelope him-
self in straining glorified elec-
tronic noisemakers. A simple
old accoustic, a violin and
perhaps a solo harmonica con-
veys his messages to the mass-
es just fine.

And, above all, the album is
pure rock ’n’ roll. He has lost
the sometimes yielding
paranoia he used to have and
lets it all hang out. There are
no safe harbors for him here;
his honesty on thisalbum can
lead him into either folk hero
or oblivion. But, through the
wrenching components of his
lyrics, he doesn't seem to care
which it will be. Like a Stein-
beck or a Kerouac, or, to bring
it closer to home, like the best
of John Lennon sung after
downing a fifth of Jack
Daniels, he presents you ‘his
art and lets it sit, never ques-
tioning or-even caring what
your opinion will be. V

Take, for instance, the‘
above-named first track,
”Paper in Fire,” a song which
Bob Guccione Jr. called
”perhaps an epiphanous
song.” Mellencamp croons,

’ ”There is a good life/Right

across the green field/And
each generation/Stares at it
from afar/But we keep no
check/On our appetites/So the
green fields turn to brown/‘Like

paper In fire. This is not emp-
ty criticism of fact—of-the-
matter, neo—American greed.
Instead, like a viscious wasp,
it stings, and leaves the stinger

within the flesh of the Ameri- .

can public. No excuses here,
just simple, fact—of-the-matter
commentary.

The other songs on the al-
bum are just as devisive.
”Check It Out” and ”The Real
Life” are both slice-of-life
pieces about the futility of to-
day's rebels without a cause

and unquenched destinies,‘

respectively. ”Hard_Times for
an Honest Man” deals with
the plight of the present day
forgotten member of the work
force, who may have just
come to the end of his rope
and doesn't know what to do.
”Empty Hands” is a simple
song (and simply sung song) of
the gloom of deprivation.

But it is ”We Are The Peo-
ple,” which is the album's best
song, and Mellencamp’s
chastising' blade of social com-
mentary doesn't let anyone go
unshaven. ”If you are one of
the homeless/May our
thoughts be with you/If you

are scared and alone/May our-

thoughts be with you/If you
are one of the fortunate
ones/We all know it's lonely

up there/We understand that

nobody’s got it made/So our
thoughts are with you.” A far
cry from someone who just
five years ago was rambling,

”Oh, baby, make it hurt so .

good/’

THE ‘PITT NEWS

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

Every sports team seems to
have one player who does things
out of the spotlight. Senior Kurt
Weber fills that role for the Pitt
soccer team.

”Kurt is a very versatile play-
er,” said Pitt coach Joe Lux-
bacher. ”He is excellent for the
team. He is a hard worker and
has a lot of determination.”

Weber is from nearby Allison
Park and admits that he didn't
think he had much of a chance
to play college soccer.

”My team in high ~ school
wasn't the greatest, and I wasn't
the best player either,” said
Weber.

Despite Weber's lack of self-
confidence, he tried out for the
Pitt soccer team his freshman
year and made the squad. Weber
admits, though, he didn't play

much his freshman season.
Luxbacher took over at the
helm of the Pitt soccer program
Weber's sophomore year, and
that's when Weber started to
make tremendous strides in his

«game, although it wasn't easy. ’’I
had to try out. Well, I made the ’

team and have improved every
year since then,” said Weber,
who gives most of the credit to
his coach.

_”Joe made all the difference, I

wasn't very smooth as a player,
and he helped me out. The first
seven years I played soccer, I
didn’t really improve. Joe
changed that. I have a lot of
respect for the man because of
it,” added Weber.

Off the field, Weber is current-
ly attending the Pitt graduate
school of business. He tries his
best in his schoolwork, but soc-
cer interferes sometimes.

”Actually everything interferes

 

with my studies," said Weber. ’’I
have very little free time. It's
tough, but I ‘expected that/’. _
Pitt's record this season of 3-8-1
isn't the best in the world, but
Weber still sees the nucleus of a
good team. .
”The team works hard, but
sometimes the results of the game
don't show it,” said Weber.

”There were a couple of games V 
we shouldn't have lost. The Q,h'ig" "

concern

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

If you take a look toward next
season, you'll see that three of
Pitt's four starting defensive backs
are seniors. But for the remainder
of this season, the secondary is of
no primary concern to Pitt.

Seniors Billy Owens, Quintin
Jones and Gary Richard and
junior Troy Washington have per-
formed very well for the Panthers
this season. Actually, the Pan-
thers are fourth in the country
against the pass, allowing only
123.0 yards per game.

”This year we have more ex-
perience,” said Owens, ac-
knowledging that these four
played together last year. ’’I think
we played good last year. For me
and a lot of others, last year was
a better year, but we still have im-
proved.”

This improvement can be seen
in the numbers they've accumu-
lated through seven games this
yeah

°'Owens, the strong safety, has
‘56 tackles (tied for fourth on the
team with linebacker Jerry Wall),

one tackle being for a loss. He '

has caused three fumbles, deflect-
ed three passes, and has record-
ed two sacks and two hurries.

0 Washington, the junior free
safety, is sixth on the team with
55 tackles. He has also deflected
six passes and has caused one
fumble and has intercepted one
pass. A _

0 Left cornerbacklones has 38
tackles, two of them for losses.
He has recovered one fumble,

for Pitt

deflected four passes and inter-
cepted one pass.

O Right cornerback Richard has
recorded 36 tackles and seven
deflected passes. He also has one
of each of the following: an inter-
ception, blocked punt and a
hurry.

”Our whole secondary is
good,” said Washington. ”A lot
of teams are not throwing much.
A lot of teams try to run at us."

‘ 

Our whole secon-
dary is good. A lot of
teams are not throwing
much. A lot ofxteams
try to run at us.

— Troy Washington

That's probably what they will
see a good deal of: running. Syra-
cuse senior quarterback Don
McPherson runs the option about
as good as anyone else in the
country. That doesn't mean he
depends on the run all the time.

’’I was telling Gary Richard the
other day that [McPherson] re-
minds me of myself. It was the
same offense we ran in high
school,” said Washington, who
was a quarterback at Duquesne
High School.

He continued, ”[McPherson]
hasn't done much running be-
cause he's been getting enough
time to pass.

Paterno has reasons
for secretive methods

By David S. Martin

Associated .Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — If you
want to know if a Penn State play-
er is injured, you'd better wait un-

‘ til game time, Coach Joe Paterno

said Tuesday.

Divulging who will play and
who won't before the game only
helps gamblers and the opposing
team, according to Paterno, who
also holds closed practices.

”l don't think you help your
team to win by telling people
what your problems are,” said
Paternoat his weekly press con-
ference. ”No. 2, 1 don't like to
gripe about injuries. You've got

_ to play with what you have.”

Paterno was asked if the NCAA
should institute a rule similar to
the NFL, requiring coaches to tell
which players were injured and
wouldn't play by Friday.

’’I’m against the rule,” said
Paterno, whose 18th-ranked, 5-2
squad hosts West Virginia, 4-3,
Saturday. ”The object  is prob-
ably because of points spreads
and things like that, for gamblers.
I don't probably want to get into
the business where I'm helping
gamblers.”

Before Penn State's 48-21 loss
to Syracuse Oct. 17, Paterno
didn't let on that cornerback Ed-
die Johnson and linebacker Pete

, Ciftopoulos wouldn't be able to

play.-

Reporters didn't know
Giftopoulos suffered a broken
hand during the previous week's
game against Rutgers. Johnson

hurt his hamstring against Rutgers
and was questionable for the
game‘. --

Paterno also didn't say any-
thing when defensive captain
Trey Bauer, a linebacker, pinched
a nerve against Cincinnati and
couldn't play the following_week
against Boston College.

”As I told the CBS people be-
fore the [Syracuse] game when

I don ’t think you help
your team to win by
telling people what
your, problems are. No.
2, I,don’t like to gripe
about injuries. You've
got to play with what
you have.”

  — Joe Paterno

they asked who was hurt, I said
you'll find out tomorrow,” Pater-
no said. ”Because I don't want
you up there talking about all the
kids that are injured. You ought
to be talking about all the kids
that are playing.”

At the press conference, Pater-
no .didn’t mention Ray Round-
tree's injury until a reporter
mentioned he had seen the
wideout on crutches. '

runs it 100 percent. Syracuse runs
the option which is not a true
wishbone, but you can't plan on
Syracuse running because they
have the passing game,”
Washington added.

McPherson has passed for
1,509 yards and 14 touchdowns
this season. Receiver Tommy
Kane has 720 yards and 10 of
those touchdowns.

”McPherson to Kane is a good
combination to be aware of. We
have to be prepared. When you
see a team get blown out, you
can't get too much from the
game,” said Owens, referring to
the Penn State—Syracuse game
two weeks ago, which the
Orangemen won 48-21.

As for whether or not the Pan-
ther secondary will. change their
style for McPherson, change from
a style that has worked well for

them, the answer is no.

”We won't change schemes.
We're basically a man-to-man
team. We won't play zone for
McPherson,” said Washington.

There is an added incentive for
the Panthers if they can win. A
victory will put them in great po-
sition for a major bowl bid. For
Owens, the right frame of mind
might do the trick.

”We’re not coming in hoping
for a win — you have to go in
knowing you're going to win.
You have to believe it; that's the
feeling I get from the rest of the
team,” he said.

PANTHER NOTES: Nine bowl
scouts will be on hand to watch
the Pitt—Syracuse game on Satur-
day. Bowls to be represented will
be the Sugar, Sun, Hall of Fame,
Orange, Florida Citrus, Gator,
Peach, Liberty and Sunkist Fies-
ta. The game will be carried by
CBS, seen locally on KDKA.
Game time is 2:45 p.m.

Continued from page 20 .

”He’s one of those guys I'm not
sure about,” said Paterno, who
led Penn State to a national
championship last season. He
also said he wasn't sure whether
Johnson would play.

Other players had suffered in-
juries in practice last week dur-
ing an off week, Paterno said. He
didn't elaborate.

Bauer, Ciftopoulos and Keith
Karpinski would be ready to play

Saturday, Paterno said. Karpinski,
who has been bothered with a

bad ankle much of the season,.

played against Syracuse.

Secrecy doesn't always work
for Paterno. Syracuse learned
Johnson wouldn't play and con-
centrated on his area, the coach
said.

”They somehow found our
corner was hurt and proceeded to_
run most of their pass offense to
that particular side,” he said.

wants just one thing to come out
of them.

”I want to save a little pride at
the end of the season,” said We-
ber. ”We‘have played well all
year, but our record doesn't show
it. If we can pull out the last three
games of the season, it will give
me something to remember my
last season with. ” ‘

Pitt gets its first shot at fulfilling

Weber's goal tonight as the Pan- ‘

thers are host to Carnegie Mellon
at Pitt Stadium at 7:15. It is the
last home game of the season for
Pitt — and one Kurt Weber hopes
he'll have reason to remember for
a long time.

Heyward J

Continued from page 19
through," and Venzon started
thinking of other ideas.

As the season wore on, and
it became more and more evi-
dent the 6—foot, 260—pound

. Heyward was putting up All-

America rushing statistics on
the field (currently 920 yards
on 219' carries and seven
touchdowns), Venzon and Lar-
ry Eldridge, Pitt sports informa-
tion director, were convinced
something had to be done.

It looks just like me.
— Craig Heyward

After Pitt beat Top 10 ranked
Notre Dame on Oct. 10, even
more attention was focused on
the Pitt program and inevitably
Heyward.

And when Heyward started
appearing in Heisman Trophy

-polls, the sports information

department knew some type of
gimmick had to be created —
and soon.

”Larry and I kept talking,
and we kept telling each other_
‘We have to do something
about this, we have to do _
something,’ ” said Venzon. ’’I
suggested the Halloween
mask, but I didn't think it
would work. The interns had
mentioned to have [the face]
on a stick.”

The concept came together
when Heyward appeared in
the sports information office
one day last week.

”One day he had to call in
to one of his radio shows with
Jim Lampley. I told him to
hold his head up and I meas-
ured [his face] with a ruler. It
was 8‘/2 [inches] by- eight,

—g t.

   

almost a square/’. said Venzon.

Voila! V ‘ ' I

Dave Bober, President of
Daily_’s Juice Products decided
to pay for the cost of the faces
and sticks, making; the idea a
reality. » 

On the backside of the
placard is the phrase ”PITT’S
PUMPING IRON,” which was
coined ‘by Ray Oliver, the Pitt
basketball team's strength 8
Coach. .

Venzon said nearly 6,000 of
the lronheads will be distribut-
ed at Saturday's game. ' I

Heyward didn't know about
the sports information office's
ploy until yesterday.

Said Venzon, ”Craig walked
into Larry's office, and he saw
me holding one of them up to
my face. You know he just
wanted to die laughing, but he
just held back.”

”-It looks just like-me,” said
Heyward,'who must have for-
gotten in his excitement the
picture is indeed an actual
photograph and not a carica-
ture or drawing.

”|t’s cool. Linda outdid her-
self this time. It reminds me of
the Natural Lite beer commer-
cial where there's 1,000 Rod-
ney Dangerfields coming out
of the spaceship. Well, there's
going to be 6,000 Ironmaniacs
out there Saturday,” said
Heyward. ’

Venzon isn't sure if the card-
board faces will be distributed .
for the two remaining home
games — Penn State (Nov. 14)
and Kent State (Nov. 21).

’’It depends on someone
sponsoring it,” she said.

If Pitt doesn't continue its
newly found gimmick, many
fans might be upset.

At least Ironhead thinks so.

”Some adults will be disap-
pointed because they don't ge
one.”' ’ I .
