Black Action Society kicks off Black Week  

By Mark Kenny
The Pitt News

The 16th annual Black Week got
underway last night at the University
of Pittsburgh with an evening of gospel
music featuring the Norfolk State
University choir along with several
local gospel singing groups.

Sponsored by the Black Action
Society, this year’s Black Week offers
a variety of cultural, social and
academic events which will be held dai-
ly through Nov. 16, when Black Week

will close with a Total Social to be held
at 7:00 p.m. in Forbes Quadrangle;

Hudson Primus, chairman of the
Black Action Society, welcomed last
night‘s audience to what he called “the
most controversial but most enlighten-
ing Black Week ever.”

‘The controversy surrounds a lecture
to be given by Rev. Louis Farrakhan, \
leader of the Nation of Islam.

The Farrakhan lecture has caused
questions about the use of student ac-
tivity fees in sponsoring controversial
speakers at Pitt. Farrakhan is schedul-
ed to speak this Thursday at 8:00 p.m.

' in Fitzgerald Field House.

The Pitt News

Louis Farrakhan will be speaking at
Pitt this Thursday, and to better under-
stand Farrakhan’s rhetoric and the
issues surrounding his visit, it is helpful
to look at the history of his sect, the
Nation of Islam, and Farrakhan’s rela-
tion to it.

Born Louis Eugene Farrakhan in
New York City 52 years ago, Far-
rakhan moved to Boston where he grew
up. He was an honors student at Boston
English High School,‘a private school,
and then spent two years at the teachers
college in Winston-Salem, N.C. Far-
rakhan worked as a singer in night
clubs under the name of “Calypso
Gene” before converting to the Nation
of Islam under the aegis of Malcolm
X in 1955. At that time, Malcolm X
was the Nation’s founder’s, Elijah
Muhammad’s, closest associate.

The Nation of Islam finds its origins
some 50 years ago when the then Eli-
jah Poole met a man named Fard

Muhammad. Fard was a Muslim and, .

inﬂuenced by his words, Elijah claimed

Dave Hooker/ The Pitt‘ News.

Fard was Allah incarnate. the Muslim
savior of that religion’s Savior Day.

Elijah Poole changed his name to Eli- -
jah Muhammad and founded the Na-
tion of Islam. Among the religious
sect’s precepts is that blacks are God’s
chosen race, ‘the inheritors of the
earth,’ and that whites are an inferior
race, the product of 600 years of selec-
tive breeding of blacks’ weakest strain
by an evil scientist named Yakub.

The Nation of Islam also calls for the
formation of an independent black
state, the ultimate solution to centuries
of repression after being brought to
America as slaves. The militant
separatist teachings of the Nation
became very popular during the civil
rights movement of the 1960s and the
Nation grew to represent some 250,000
people.

Within the civil rights movement, the
Nation presented an alternative to the
preachings of Martin Luther King, Jr.
and in 1963 it boycotted King’s*historic
‘I have a dream’ address in Washington
D.C.

The Nation of Islam today has only
5,000-10,000 followers. Many left the
Nation after Malcolm X rejected its

T. teachings in 1964 and still more left g _ _  H

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

In an earler statement to The Pitt
News, Primus explained the purpose of
Black Week, saying, ‘.‘[It’s for] Pitt to
feel the presence and the role of blacks
on campus. Since all the students, black
and white alike, have paid activity fees,
I feel this is the time for blacks to get
their own fair share of their money.”

Last night, Primus said this year’s
Black Week is special, ‘because, “we
have a whole week of programs.” He
said that while caucasians might not be
interested, the week‘s events would
serve the black interests first and
foremost. “We have to-move.forward
in the struggle,” he told the audience.

Middle East policies criticized

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

In a Thursday evening address to the
Middle East Forum at Pitt the Reagan
Administration was sharply criticized
about its Middle Eastern policies.

Milton Viorst, a Washington-based
writer specializing in the Middle East,
commenced by -rebukinig the presi-
dent’s handling of the Achille Iauro
crisis. .

‘ ‘Egyptian President Mubarek acted
in a manner that saved the lives of 400
hostages  and Reagan castigated
him,” Viorst remarked. “Instead of
getting the respect they deserved,
Mobarak and the Italian Prime Minister
were publicly humiliated. ”

According to Viorst, terrorism is fo-
cused primarily on Americans because
“the United States is perceived to be
the only great power which has the
capacity to do anything in the Middle
East.” He said he believes the U.S.
government should be impartial, and
he feels it has behaved in a biased man-
ner on several occasions. .

Viorst sees a correlation between

America’s indirect engagement in the ‘

Lebanese Civil War and the suicidal
bombings of the U.S. embassy in

-Farrakhan’s past examined

when he was murdered in 1965 under
accusations that the Nation had
assassinated him.

The Nation suffered another setback
in 1975 when the founder, Elijah
Muhammad, died and his son, Imam
Warith Deen Muhammad, was named
his successor. Imam Muhammad
opened the faith to all races and re-
jected manyof his father’s idiosyn-
cratic teachings, turning to a more
traditional reading of the Koran. Im-
am Muhammad named his new sect the
American Muslim Mission.

Farrakhan, then leader of the Na-
tion’s New York mission, condemned
Imam Muhammad for betraying Elijah
and took over leadership of the rem-
nants of the Nation, made up mostly
of the Nation’s more militant wing, the
Fruit of Islam.

Last year Imam Muhammad
disbanded the American Muslim Mis-
sion, calling for the integration of the
movement into the worldwide Islamic
religion. I

Farrakhan became a national public
ﬁgure last year when he supported Rev.
Jesse Jackson. in. his bid for the

‘Democratic presidential nomination;
.._._,c.0!I_t-mu-id. onpase-7-» .»  

Regarding the Farrakhan lecture,
though, Primus especially urged all
people to attend. “We all need to be
there, Caucasian too,” said Primus.
“We all need to be there to hear the
truth from his mouth  not the New
York Times.” . .

Other people scheduled to appear at
Pitt as part of Black Week are: Con-
gressman Walter Fauntroy, who will
speak at 8:00 p.m. tonight in the
William Pitt ballroom; writer Toni
Cade Bambara will be on campus Nov.
12 at 8:00 p.m. in the assembly room
of the student union; Dr. Barbara
Sizemore will speak on Nov. 13 in the

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1985

ballroom at 8:00 p.m. and Dr. Lloyd
Bell will be at Pitt on Nov. 15 at noon
in the ballroom of the student union.

In addition to speakers, there will be _

a display of African art in the William
Pitt ballroom today and tomorrow. The
exhibit opens at 1 1 :00 a.m. both days.

A minority job fair will be held Nov.
14 starting at 9:00 a.m. in the ballroom
and a soul food dinner will be served
on Nov. 14 in the Pitt cafeteria‘.

The film “Soldier’s Story” will be
shown at 7:30 and 10:00 p.m. in David
Lawrence hall on Nov. 15, and the
week will end with the Total Social on
Nov. 16.,

Beirut. “We have brought much upon

ourselves,” stated Viorst. “The bat-"

tleship New Jersey shelled the
Lebanese coast  and we paid the
price later — 220 marines were
killed.”

Viorst, though, reserves the majori-
ty of his censure “not for what Reagan
has done but for what he has failed to
do.” The journalist believes the
Reagan administration should work
toward the resolution of the Palestinian
crisis.

“The problem is that there are nearly
four million angry dispossessed
homeless Palestinians in the Middle
East  I do think a [West Bank] set-
tlement satisfying a majority on both
sides could be reached  We know,
though, that the ’Middle East will
become increasingly imperfect if the
Palestinian situation is not resolved.”

Viorst alleges that the president has ‘I

pursue peace” and has been somewhat

reluctant to push’ for a West'Baril€”s’e't'-' 

tlement because of his pro—Israeli posi-
tions. Viorst attributes several factors
to the ‘formulation of the president’s
supposed bias. ,

“Reagan respects power. He likes
the idea of tough, little Israel defending
U.S. interests in the Middle East,”
Viorst stated.

In contrast, Viorst believes the
Reagan administration perceives the
majority of Arab states to be “weak
and having nothing to give us [i.e. the
United States].”

Viorst also discussed what he‘ —
believes are the underlying reasons for .

terrorist activity. In quoting a recent
New York Times editorial, he
remarked:

“There are deadly symptoms of
political and social malaise [in] ter-
rorism  It is the only way the weak

envinced “a protracted indifference to

and J ohnstown areas.

For the third consecutive year Pitt is battling Penn State in a blood drive
sponsored by the the Central Blood Bank; and although last Friday’s ﬁgures
place Penn State ahead with a score of 1,973 pints of blood collected to
Pitt’s 1,748, a spokesman from the Pittsburgh chapter of the Central Blood
Bank believes there is “reason for hope.” Pitt will probably catch up over
the weekend because of mobile blood drives throughout the Pittsburgh

The competition with Penn State has been an incentive to donate blood

for many Pitt students. Fran Bartasavich, a freshman, gives blood on a

‘ regular basis but said she feels “twice as good since it will help beat Penn

State.” She stated that the blood drive is “really a good idea because "there

is a lot of competition between Pitt and Penn State. We [Pitt students]

would do just about anything, especially when we’re so unsure of the out-
come of the football game. Penn State is having a great year.”

Reagan Administration expects little at Geneva talks

WASHINGTON — Moscow and
Washington are closing in on the ﬁnal
week before the Geneva Summit.
Secretary of State Schultz said yester-
day on CBS that whether the meeting
produces a more constructive and

stable superpower relationship “re-

mains to be seen.” Schultz, who
recently met with Soviet ofﬁcials in
Moscow, said that a joint communique
after the summit is unlikely, but he
denied that the absence of such a docu-
ment would mean the meeting was
unproductive.

The Secretary said President Reagan
will be prepared to meet Soviet
criticism head-on and ﬁre back with his

own view of how Kremlin actions are ‘

responsible for bilateral tensions.
Schultz insisted that the Reagan ad-
ministration has been consistent in its
predictions of what may come out of
Geneva so that it would not raise the
public expectations beyond what could

‘ be achieved.

grieving for all—star goalie Pelle Lind-
bergh who was declared brain dead
yesterday afternoon following a serious
car accident.

Team doctor Edward Viner said
Lindbergh’s chances of recovering are
“almost nil.” The doctor said Lind-
bergh is being kept alive on life-support
systems, but the family will at some
point have to decide when to take him
off.

Team spokesman Rodger Gottlieb
called the incident “a tragedy of over-
whelming proportions.” Dozens of
fans gathered at the Stratford hospital
to express their grief.

Lindbergh was the Flyers’ Most
Valuable Player last year and also won
the Vezina trophy as the National
Hockey League’s top goaltender.

Lindbergh was driving his 1985
Porsche turbo through Somerdale,
N .J. ,,early yesterday morning when he
lost control of the car and careened in-
to the concrete steps of a local school.

Gottlieb said there was evidence of
alcohol in Lindbergh’s blood but he
didn't know if it contibuted to the ac-

cident. If it did, he said he hopes it will
be a lesson to youths who might be
tempted to drink and drive.

Two passengers who were in the car
at the time of the accident are being
treated at New Jersey hospitals.

Dissident sailor
dispute settled

NEW ORLEANS, — Early yester-
day a Soviet freighter moved from the
Mississippi River into the international
waters of the Gulf of Mexico loaded
with American grain. Aboard is the
young seaman — a would-be defector
—- who changed his mind and stirred
up a hornet’s nest of controversy.

Secretary of State Schultz may have
added to the questions surrounding the
Miroslav Medvid case when he hinted
yesterday on CBS that Soviet
authorities may have threatened to
harm the youth’s parents if he defected.
Schultz refused to comment on reports
that U.S. intelligence overheard the
Soviet embassy order the ship’s cap-
tain to drug Medvid after his forced
return to the vessel. Schultz did admit
the sailor “was ill” and “repeatedly
referred to mama and papa” and
“talked about life” when ﬁrst ques-
tioned by U.S. officials.”

Medvid jumped from the. Soviet
grain ship twice last month and initial-
ly asked for political asylum. He was
twice returned to the vessel by U.S.
officials.

Schultz defended the U.S. handling

N ational. debt
haunts capital

WASHINGTON — Congressional
procrastination will haunt Capital Hill
this week when the federal debt limit,
a stop-gap money bill and the 16 cent-
a-pack cigarette tax expires.

The House and Senate have yet to
settle their differences about a balanced
budget bill that’s holding the federal
debt ceiling limit hostage. Treasury
Secretary Baker has warned Congress
that higher interest rates may be one
of the consequences of failing to raise
the debt limit to $2 trillion by Thurs-
day. That day has been labeled “drop
dead day” in Capitol Hill vernacular.
Interim funding keeping government
agencies running until regular ‘ap-
propriation bills are passed expires
Thursday.

A controversial extension of the
cigarette tax also expires this Thursday.
President Reagan is opposed to the tax
and White House sources say the Presi-
dent may veto any measure containing
the tax.

Study reveals
rise in child abuse

— Two University researchers said
cases of child abuse — such as kick-
ing, biting, hitting with a ﬁst or
threatening with weapons — dropped
over the last 10 years. The University
of New Hampshire’s Murray Straus
said a survey showed serious physical
abuse against children fell near_ly.50
percent since researchers did a similar
study in 1975.

Straus and Richard Gelles of the
University of Rhode Island said the
ﬁndings meant there are 705,000 fewer
victims of brutally violent child abuse.

They also report overall violence
against children increased slightly in
the 10-year period. Straus said violence
ranging from throwing an object at a
child to using a gun or knife was
measured. The researchers said these
"incidents occurred in 63 percent of
American families each year — up
from 62 percent in 1975. _

Straus and Gelles _ represent _ their

ﬁndings today at a Chicago meeting_of
the National Conference on Child
Abuse and Neglect.

Democracy Facade

Ferdinand Marcos, the unpopular president of the
Philippines, has recently proposed to undertake
democratic elections on Jan. 17, 1986. Clearly, this
proposal is a ruse designed to confound his op-
ponents at home and to mollify American pressures
for political reform.

Mr. Marcos is a shrewd politician. He would not
have suggested this election unless he were certain
he could win it. The election is merely yet another
instance of Marcos’ cunning at disguising
authoritarian rule with democratic facades.

Mr. Marcos’ oppressive regime is one that is
founded on corruption and tainted by great injustices
and blatant violations of human rights. His rule is
increasingly unpopular and the opposition’s strength
and radicalism are growing apace. The Friday,
Nov. 6 edition of The New York Times reported that
“the guerrilla force‘ [in the Philippines] has
quadrupled in ﬁve years to 15,000.” '

Aside from considerations of moral signiﬁcance,
the United States has important interests to protect
in the Philippines. Not only is it an important
trading partner, but two vitally important U.S.
military installations are located in the Philippines
as well. For these reasons the United States is ter-
ribly concerned with promoting political and social
stability in the Philippines. Increasingly, it appears
that the initiation of democratic elections and a truly
representative form of government are necessary
to quell civil strife and, thereby, protect American
interests.

The United States should not trust Marcos’
scheme, nor should it continue to provide his regime
with support unless it shows genuine progress
toward real reform. Marcos’ policies are rapidly
alienating the people of his nation, and continued
American association with his regime will serve on-
ly to poison the people’s view of our country. This
we cannot afford, especially as Marcos’ position
becomes increasingly precarious.

Farrakhan Debate S

Louis Farrakhan has been the topic
of conversation throughout this city.
Students from several universities and
many special interest groups have made
statements and counterstatements for
and against the man and what he
represents. The newspaper and televi-
sion media had a ﬁeld day with the
controversy.

As the Jewish arm of the city univer-
sities, B’nai B’rith Hillel stands strong
in its committment to Jewish pride,
understanding and education. We op-
pose any individual who preaches
destruction and/or violent action
toward Jews or any other group of peo-
ple. And it is our goal, through educa-
tion, to enlighten the public when a
threatening situation occurs. We have
not closed our eyes to Farrakhan’s
history of anti-Semetic remarks.

The staff of Hillel serves only as an
administrative voice of our students. It
is felt that a peaceful demonstration,
although in order, is a physical threat
to the students because of the volatili-
ty of Rev. Farrakhan. Our approach is
to inform students and allow them to
go to the Farrakhan lecture. And we

are waiting after his presentation to"

react to the implication of this visit. For
it is only then that we could prepare a
fully educated response.

This invitation to Louis Farrakhan to
speak at Pitt, though perhaps not inten-
tionally, has caused tension on campus
and friction among campus organiza-
tions. We hope that a lesson has been
learned through this unfortunate event.
Although the situation has caused great
unrest, Hillel continues to advocate
education as the only realistic approach
to this situation.

Rabbi Joe Levine -

B'nai B’rith Hillel

This is in response to the letter by
Lyndon Kirkland, to the university
policy on controversial speakers as
cited by President Wesley Posvar, and
Barbara
Sizemore, all of which appeared in the
Nov. 6 issue of The Pitt News.

Kirkland should know that I’ve
thought about it, and that I‘m man
enough to stand up to the likes of him!
His words reek of hypocrisy and
paranoia.

Kirkland talks of having an open-
minded and unbiased attitude, yet he
supports a speech by Louis Farrakhan.
This is hypocrisy. Is Farrakhan unbi-
ased toward the Jewish faith? Is he
open-minded to the idea of sharing this
country and this world with Jews,
Christians and people of all faiths and
races? I think not.

ideas in practice in the past and the _

Kirkland complains of criticism by
people who’ve never heard Farrakhan
speak. I never heard Adolph Hitler
speak, but the record of history is clear
enough that I would not want my
money to subsidize a speech by him,
either directly or through any student
fund. The subsidizing of Farrakhan’s
speech is a legitimate gripe amonghis
detractors. Everyone should be con-
cerned with where their money goes.
And the choice of whether or not to go
see Farrakhan merely determines
whether or not more of my money will
be spent on Farrakhan; it does nothing
about money already wasted. Kirkland
claims he exercised his right not to go
see former President Ford and William
Shockley, yet he calls Dr. Shockley
audacious without having heard him
speak. How hypocriticial can a person
be? Personally, I also disagree with
Shockley, but I 'don’t espouse, as
Kirkland does, that one has to physical-
ly hear what another says in order to
disagree with it. Reading is a valuable
mode of education. I’ve read enough
by and about Hitler, Shockley and Far-
rakhan to know that I neither need to
hear them nor want to help in the fund-
ing of any other listeners’ opportunity
to do so. ,

Kirkland’s claim that White America
doesn’t care to see black leaders stand
up for Black America is the most
paranoid defense I’ve heard about Far-
rakhan. I have yet to hear a single Far-
rakhan detractor state that he decries
Farrakhan because he is a black leader.
Why is it that every time someone who
happens "to be white criticizes someone
who happens to be black it instantly
becomes a black-white conﬂict? I
disagree with what Farrakhan says, not
with what he looks like. The issue here
transcends race. Society as a whole
must grow up to the point where we
can look beyond the many colors of our
skin and the many practices of our
faiths and live together on the same
level, irrespective of our inborn dif-
ferences. The day must come when a
white man talking with a black man is
seen as a man talking with a man.

Kirkland says he has not seeen Far-
rakhan and will notjudge him until he
does, and yet he says he speaks the
truth. What truth? He claims that the
media is bad, so what evidence does

he have of Farrakhan’s truth? And why I

does he use the “bad media” to express
his agreement with Farrakhan? Why is
it that Kirkland can agree with Far-
rakhan without hearing him while I
cannot disagree on the same grounds?
This hardly seems fair or consistent.

As for the university policy on con-
troversial speakers, I take issue with the
phrase “no idea is unthinkable." I have
to believe that the advocacy of one race
or religion dominating another is un-
thinkable. We’ve'seen these types of

results have been abhorrent to anyone
with an ounce of moral consciousness.

Dr. Sizemore’s comments are as
disturbing as Kirkland’s. Doesn’t Dr.
Sizemore read? Numerous articles have
quoted Farrakhan’s bigoted and anti-
semitic remarks. He has been a media
event for over a year, and the whole
hullabaloo is over his statements. If Dr.
Sizemore hasn’t heard, she’s out of
touch.

As a student of the law, I know that
we are a free nation. I know we have
the right to say what we please. But as
an observant person, I know that
freedom can be abused. One need on-
ly read about the extra security
measures scheduled for the ﬁeld house
on the night of Farrakhan’s speech to
see the concern of the administration
over the potential for abuse of
freedom of assembly. As a moral per-
son, I feel that one’s freedom ends
where it infringes on another’s. The
university community should have the
sense of morality to see the infringe-
ment of Farrakhan’s speech on the right
of a certain group of students to walk
this campus secure in the knowledge
that they have not indirectly paid a man
to advocate, to anyone who will listen,
the theory of their inferiority. The Con-
stitution was designed as a shield for
the rights of the people, not as a sword
for the causes of a few extremists
among them, and it should not be used
as such.

Lest I be viewed as just another white
bigot, I would like to close this letter
with a few constructive suggestions for
the Black Action Society. Next year;
why not invite Los Angeles mayor
Tom Bradley, or. former Con-
gresswoman Barbara Jordan, or jour-
nalist Carl Rowan?’ Why not think
positively and watch people react
positively?

Why Are You Reading This Column?

Do you know why you’re reading
this column? You don’t have to write
in and tell me why; Ijust want you to
ask yourself. Why are you reading this?

Is it because you are interested in
other people’s opinions? Were you
looking for someone to discuss an issue
which interests you? Did you want me
to disagree with you so you could say
to yourself,“what an idiot!” and feel
smug and superior and have an excuse
to let off some steam by writing a nas-
ty letter to the editor? Or were you hop-
ing I would say something to help you
understand why someone would take
a position so different from your own,
especially when it’s so obvious to you

that you’re right? (And you are always
right, aren’t you?)

Maybe you thought I’d agree with
you and supply you with some infor-
mation which you could use in a discus-
sion some day. Then again it can be
comforting to know that there’s some-
one out there who agrees with you,
especially if your opinion is not a very
fashionable one. (I feel this way myself
when I read a letter or column written
by someone who agrees with me.) Or

' perhaps you wanted to see your inex-

pressible feelings put into words — a

true joy if there ever were one.
There are other reasons why you

could be reading this column. Perhaps

the title caught your eye while you
were looking for discount fast food
coupons. On the other hand, you may
have ‘noticed my name and began
wondering what bizzare, off-the-wall,
social Darwini-stic thing I’d say this
time. Or maybe you were looking for
some other section and inadvertantly
turned to the wrong page. (There was
a time when the only thing I liked about
The Pitt News was the way it would ﬁt
over my sink whenever I trimmed my
beard. Only I don’t have a beard
anymore, so I began writing more let-
ters and columns to make sure I’d ﬁnd
something I liked in The Pitt News.)

There is, of course, the possibility

that you may not have a reason at all.
Maybe you don’t have a reason for do-
ing anything — and if you didn’t have
a reason for doing the important things,
like deciding to go to school, getting
a part-time job, selecting your major
and choosing a mate, why would you
need a reason for reading this column?
(There really are people who do things
for no reason at all. And — Surprise!
— they can’t understand people who
like to have reasons.) A

‘Before I close, I will tell you one of
the reasons why I wrote this column.
In “Prometheus Rising,” Robert An-
ton Wilson asks the reader,“Why did

you buy this book?...why do you read
books of this sort...?” One question

leads to another, and in a short time, '

the questions start getting deep, and

their depth increases exponentially. (If I

you don’t know what “exponentially”
means, ask a friend who is studying
algebra or calculus. Better yet, study
these things yourself.)

I had so much fun with the question
that I thought I’d pass it on to you.
Education starts with questions, and the
best place to begin questioning is with

yourself. That’s why I wrote this,

column.
But why did you read it?

Washington Post Writers Gr0up/ Richard Cohen

South Africa: Image Sacrificed For Power

Shortly before my recent trip to
South Africa, my young cousin conﬁd-
ed that he was afraid for my safety.
That seemed reasonable. Television
news almost nightly showed scenes of
violence and reports of a rising body
count. I tried to reassure him. Most of
the dead had been killed in places and
under circumstances that a journalist
could avoid. My explanation did no
good. The boy, it turned out, thought
the South African government wanted
to kill me.

Examine his logic. He knew I was
a critic of the South African regime.
He knew I had already written columns
denouncing apartheid. He felt an
almost physical repugnance for the
policies of the South African" govern-
ment and he knew, from our casual
conversations, that I felt the same way.
If that was the case, he reasoned, why
were the South Africans allowing me

into the country? After all, they had to

know what I would probably write.

Adults are supposed to have the
answers, but I had none. And I still
don't. But two explanations suggest
themselves, and they both bode ill for
the future of South Africa-U.S. rela-
tions and, indeed, for the future of
South Africa itself. The ﬁrst explana-
tion is that no matter what the South
African government may look like to
Americans, it considers itself a
Western democracy and does its best
to behave accordingly. That means ad-
mitting most foreign journalists who
apply, rejecting only those whose
reporting they think has already prov-
en hostile.

The second explanation is much
harder for Americans to understand. It _
is that ofﬁcial South Africa really
thinks that once you get to see its coun-
try, understand its problems and com-
plexities, then you will also understand
why the government does what it does.
For instance, it is almost incomprehen-

sible for whites to hear criticism of the
government for imposing emergency
rule on much of the country when the
decree is ostensibly supposed to save
black lives.

Now, however, South Africa has im-
posed severe restrictions on the press.
No longerwill Americans be able to
turn on the television set and see scenes
of rioting blacks or, as happened
recently, the police entrapping young
rioters and then opening fire on them.
The lack of pictures will not mean that
such scenes are not being repeated dai-
ly. It only means that television crews
have been banned from the 38 districts
where the emergency decree applies.
In theatrical terms, South Africa has
gone dark.

Of course, the new restrictions have
a utilitarian value. Not only do they
tighten the hold the police have on the
country, but they will, sooner or later,
tend to diminish South Africa as a

television news story and thus as an
issue in this country. But this kind of
censorship, while effective, has its
costs. In South Africa’s case, it is its
image of itself as a Western
democracy.

The press edicts represent Capitula-
tion, exhaustion — a government that
no longer thinks it can make its case
to the world or. worse, maybe no
longer cares to. No longer can ofﬁcial
South Africa think that a sojourn in that
country will swing a journalist to the
government‘s point of view — that in
appreciating the complexity of the
country they will also come to ap-
preciate the necessity of racial
segregation.

In this sense, Pretoria has come to
realize that the gulf between Americans
and many white South Africans is as
great as the one between the United
States and the Soviet Union — a mat-
ter not of information, but of values.

As with the Soviet Union, familiarity
breeds contempt. No enemy of apart-
heid is as passionate as someone who
has witnessed it.

In censoring both the domestic and ' '

foreign press, by making it subordinate
to any police ofﬁcer on the spot, South
Africa illustrates the corrosive effect of
apartheid — how the efforts of a
minority to subjugate a majority sooner

or later robs the minority of its values. '
’ In this case, South African whites are

slowly surrendering their image of
themselves as Western, Christian,
democratic. Slowly, they concede that
these values are secondary to the
highest value of all: holding power.

The press edicts move South Africa
closer to the image held by my young
cousin and farther from the image it
once had of itself. He saw it as a
totalitarian regime that was capable of
doing anything. It’s beginning to see
itself the same way.

People are

Looking around, I would have to say '

that people are miserable these days.
I may sound harsh, but they are quite
miserable these days.

You know the ones. They storm
around grumbling to themselves, their
nostrils ﬂaring and their eyebrows
pointing blatantly at their noses. They
are just plain miserable. Perhaps they
are irritated about something, or
perhaps they are just having a bad day.

. Nevertheless, their misery glows‘ like

b an onion.

I realize I wrote about misery last
spring in a similar column, but just take
a look around. I’d safely say that peo-
ple once again need to be reminded that
their’ misery rubs off on others, creating
a society full of grumps.

That's right — grumps! In a recent
Public Speaking class, a student was in-

‘ formed that she was receiving a less-

than-satisfactory grade. Consequently,
the student became irate, letting the
teacher know of her discontent in, shall

pened. Other students growled, the
teacher growled back, and the next
thing you knew, the entire class was in
an uproar. Yes, they were miserable.

Those 20 students undoubtedly ven-
tured beyond the classroom, spreading
their gloom. Oh, and I would have
hated to be in the faculty lounge after
that class’. What a real mess they

 

created.

And, you know, it doesn’t take much
for those miserable people to rub off
on others. Once, a girl was simply
complaining about waiting for so long
to catch an elevator in the William Pitt
Union. Others gathered, and she soon
had them all complaining. As I waited
there, I stayed away from the gmm-
bling crowd. They weren’t going to
ruin my day. Finally, the elevator ar-
rived, and the girl quit complaining.
She got off of the elevator on the first
ﬂoor.‘ Now, I was irate.

Some bus drivers are notorious for
their abilities to ruin the days of a bus-
load of people. They bark and yell at
everyone, and they send people off to

work and school ready to choke.

everyone. Talk about mass

communication.

You know, I ﬁrmly believe that peo-
ple don’t have to go through life, day
after day, miserable. The problem is
that they just take life too seriously.
They never take a step back, look
themselves square in the face and
laugh. Heck, when I take time to look
at myself, I can’t help but laugh. ‘

Life can be funny, people. Even
those moments when you want to throw
up your’ hands and cry can be funny.

were soaked. Soon, my umbrella blew
inside out, and the elements got the best
of me. Others grumbled. I laughed.
What else could I do? I was wet, and
grumbling was not going to offer me
warmth. As I laughed, others tried to
laugh also. Soon, all were laughing.

The Pitt News, ‘November 11, 1985

I’m almost certain we looked like wet,
wilted fools, but, well, so what.

In high school, I went out with a girl
who didn’t like me too well. At one
point, she let me know by putting gum
in my hair. This was another prime
tragic situation, but again, I laughed.
What else could I do? Well, I never did
ask her out again. Oh well.

But seriously,_ just keep in mind that
when you storm around, glaring and
grumbling at others, you are creating
a society of people who will storm
around, glaring and grumbling at
others. Maybe one of those same peo-
ple will come back and grumble at you.
Now wouldn’t that be a miserable
thought?

View from Capitol Hill/ Gus Savage

On the question of Rev. Louis
Farrakhan, as discussed in last
week's column, some weakerblack
leaders have fallen for the racist
trap set by the white news media.

Some have even suggested that a
black leadership summit be con-

though no such summit has been
suggested over our real problems:
black unemployment, black mort-
gage foreclosures, black high
school dropouts, the cutting back of
black student enrollment in white

black colleges.

And the problems listed above
are but a portion of our genuine,
major concerns. There are the
growing tragedies of black broken
homes, black men killing and
cheating on one another while liv-

vened to deal with the question —— .

colleges and the bankruptcy "of ’

ing on their mommas or their
girlfriends — and black women
believing like white feminists or
sneaking around with white men.
Why not have a black leadership
summit, but with these pressing
black issues on the agenda, not
Farrakhan?
Okay,
Farrakhan?
He attracted nearly 40,000 or-
dinary blacks in New York City
recently, and they were willing to .
pay and be searched just to hear his
message. He attracted a crowd of
7,000 in Houston not too long ago,
while I was there to address a cou-
ple hundred students at Prairie
View College, and 11,000 turned
out to hear him in Washington,
D.C. and 13,000 in Los -Angeles.
What about Farrakhan?

then, what about

The White Media and Farrakhan

What other black leader can at-
tractmore? Other black leaders
would do better to respond to what
is attracting tens of thousands of
blacks to Farrakhan than to respond
to the racist fears of the whites.

Did leaders of the Jewish com-
munity ask to confer with us when
they opposed affirmative action in
the Bakke case? Have they sought
to confer with us regarding Israel’s
selling arms to the white facist
regime of South Africa and
marketing of South African gold
and diamonds?

What about Farrakhan?

Those who understand don’t
answer the white media; and those
who answer don’t understand.

Farrakhan

continued from page 1

until Jackson received secret service
protection, he was guarded by
members of the Fruit of Islam. Far-
rakhan also accompanied Jackson to
Syria with other religious leaders on a
mission to free Navy Lt. Robert Good-
man in February 1984. When Jackson
referred to New York City as “hymie
town,” a derogatory statement aimed
at the Jewish community, many felt he
was speaking under the inﬂuence of
Farrakhan.

Farrakhan has been criticized for his
apparent anti-Sernitic pronouncements.
Farrakhan called Judaism a “dirty
religion” [some listeners heard the
phrase as “gutter religion”], accused
Israel of “thievery, lying and deceit,”
and charged that the United States was
engaged in “criminal conspiracy” sup-
porting Israel.

Before being associated with
Jackson’s campaign, Farrakhan in-
stituted the People Organized and
Working for Economic Rebirth.
Founded in 198 1, POWER is designed
to help keep black consumer dollars
within the black community. The
organization was funded by a $5

— million interest-free loan from Libyan

leader Col. Moammar el—Qadhaﬁ.
Farrakhan has traveled to 15 cities
this year to promote POWER, what he
calls ‘Phase Two’ of his plan for black
development through self-help, when
he will start to build black economic
power in the United States, the Carib-
bean and Africa. ,
POWER had’ planned to manufacture

and distribute household products in the ,

black community. but was dealt a set-
back last month when the Johnson Pro-
ducts Company dropped plans to make
the products. Johnson spokesmen said
they didn’t want to offend their
distribution channels by being
associated with Farrakhan and his con-
troversial statements.

Farrakhan’s rhetoric may have hurt

his cause in the marketplace, but it has A

also gained him some new friends:
right-wing white supremacist groups
have given Farrakhan some of his most
vocal support. Thomas Metzger, a
former Ku Klux Klan leader and now
the head of the White American
Political Association, said recently that
his group contibuted $100 to the Na-
tion of Islam. Metzger described his
group as a “white nationalist”
organization.

White supremacists also supported
Elijah Muhammad, the founder of the
Nation of Islam. In 1962, George Lin-
coln Rockwell, the “Fuhrer” of the
American Nazi Party, attended a Na-
tion of Islam rally and contributed $20
to Muhammad’s group.

Despite the controversy surrounding
Farrakhan’s message, many blacks feel
he articulates the needs of the black
community today. In particular, Far-
rakhan is advocating a program of
black self-help through the acquisition
of financial and political power, a pro-
gram which he shares with conven-
tional black leaders. In a similar way,
the Nation of Islam preaches what for
many is an attractive system of conser-
vative values of a ‘pure life,’ the pro-

totype character being a member of the
Fruit of Islam. Furthermore, many
blacks recognize that Farrakhan is
voicing a latent anger within the black
community which calls attention to
blacks’ persistent disadvantages in
American society. In an article in The
New York Times, the chairman of the
Afro-American studies department at
Seton Hall Universiy in South Orange,
New Jersey said, “His rhetoric is an
escape valve for certain tensions of be-
ing oppressed. But his program is now
much vaguer than it has ever been. I’ve
been waiting for something to happen
programmatically from Farrakhan for
a long time.”

Farrakhan was invited to speak here
by Pitt’s Black Action Society [BAS]
last spring; the fees were approved by
the Student Government Board. Under
growing criticism, the SGB defended
their action by explaining Pitt’s policy
concerning controversial speakers. The
policy states “when the so-called con-
troversial speaker is invited to the cam-
pus by a recognized campus organiza-
tion, he speaks not because he has a
right to be heard, but because the
students have a right to hear him.” The
university administration has taken the
same position when pressed to con-
demn Farrakhan’s visit to the Pitt cam-
pus. The SGB, however, did go one
step further and denounced Farrakhan’s
‘racist’ comments while urging the
BAS to do the same. The BAS has
refused, deciding as many others have
to let students make their own

Best-seller lists these days are ﬁlled
with books promoting diets that make
news rather than sense. Even if you are
able to sort out the reasonable from the
ridiculous, you may still face the prob-
Iem of trying to adjust to a nutritional
scheme different from the mix you’re
used to. How, then, do you go about
improving your eating habits without
embarking on a radical dietary
overhaul? One easily implemented step
in the right direction involves simply
making sure to include more of the ten
foods listed below in meal planning and
selection.

BANANAS.

Advantage: potassium

Low in calories and fat, the banana
is a perfect example of a ﬂavorful food
that is exceptionally good for you. It
contains a number of minerals, notably
potassium, one of the body’s most im-
portant elements.
a‘ counterbalancing action with sodium
and is directly connected to proper ﬂuid
balance and overall muscle tone. A
potassium shortage can lead to
weakness, insomnia, even an irregular
heart rate. Keep up your natural
potassium supply with a banana a day,
sliced on cereal, wrapped into pancakes
or frozen on a stick.

BRAN MUFFINS.

Advantage: ﬁber.
Wheat bran boasts a healthy amount
of cellulose, the natural ﬁber thought

to aid in the prevention of colon cancer

The Pitt News, November 11, 1985

Nine foods to keep you healthy

and other intestinal diseases. Diets rich
in ﬁber have been found to also help
reduce‘ serum cholesterol, implicated in
coronary and circulatory conditions. A
bran mufﬁn is a tasty way to put ﬁber
in your diet.

BROCCOLI.

Advantage: vitamins A and C.

One cup of lightly steamed broccoli
contains only 40 calories, yet provides
75 to 100 percent of the suggested adult
daily requirement of vitamin A. This
vitamin is essential not just for better
eyesight, but also for helping to main-
tain the body’s immune function and
keeping bones and teeth in good order.
In addition, broccoli contains vitamin
C which, like vitamin A, is thought to
provide a link to cancer prevention. As
a snack, tossed into salads, or as a side
dish, broccoli — the stems as well as
the ﬂowers — should be on everyone’s
must list.

CHICKEN.

Advantage: lean protein.

Protein is composed of amino acids,
whose essential roles in overall health
include proper immune function and
hormone balance, good muscle tone
and even skin resilience. Chicken is
one of the best protein choices. Easily
digested, it has, ounce for ounce, more
protein than steak does and without the
fat calories of beef. Chicken is also a
good source of the minerals sulfur,
phosphorus, selenium and copper.

Note: For the lowest fat content,

remove the skin and then broil or roast
the meat.

FLOUNDER.

Advantage: polyunsaturated fat.

According to current research,
polyunsaturated fats found in ﬂounder
can actually help improve the quality
of one’s general health by lowering
blood-cholesterol levels. Flounder has
much lower levels of saturated fats than
does red meat or even poultry. As a
protein source, ﬂounder is excellent as
well, with four ounces providing more
than a third of the adult recommended
daily allowance.

MILK, 99/ FAT-FREE.

Advantage: calcium and phosphorus.

These two essential and complemen-
tary minerals are found together in milk
and in a ratio beneﬁcial to the absorp-
tion and utilization of the two elements.
Calcium is needed for regular muscle
function as well as for strong teeth and
bones. Phosphorus in involved in near-
ly all metabolic functions, including
heart and muscle contraction, the
digestive processes and the transfer of
cellular energy. What we don’t need
are excess fats contained in whole-milk
products. Ninety—nine-percent fat-free
milk provides a good compromise: a
small amount of fat to aid nutrient ab-
sorption, especially of the fat-soluble
vitamins A and D, usually added to
milk.

The Pitt News, November 11, 1985

Reagantakes a look

In a candid discussion with Reader’s
Digest Washington Editor, William
Schulz, Ronald Reagan talks about
himself, his administration and the
future.

Q: When you came into office,
some European intellectuals viewed
you as an actor-cowboy with
simplistic views of the world. Did
that bother you, and do you think
that view has changed?

A: It didn’t really bother me because
I had gone through something similar
before. There were people who thought
no one could go straight from the act-
ing profession to governor without hav-
ing held any other political ofﬁce.

But we ran California very well, if
I may say so. And as I’ve noted many
times, that was no small job. If Califor-
nia were a nation, it would be the
world’s. seventh-greatest economic
power. And after I was governor, I was
asked by President Nixon to represent
the United States on a number of mis-
sions that took me to 18 differen
countries. 1

So I wasn’t overly concerned by
foreign critics. I do think there has been
a change now that the other heads of
state of the allied nations and I have
worked together — here, abroad and
at the economic summit conferences —
and no, I don’t think the old stereotype
still prevails.

Q: You called the Soviet Union the
“evil empire.” You’ve seen the
Soviets shoot down KAL 007 and
murder an American major. At
other times, you’ve suggested that
you and Mr. Gorbachev can work
together to achieve peace. Aren’t
those contradictory positions?

A: Not at all. At the very start of this
administration, I spoke bluntly about
the Soviet Union. Later, I did call it an
evil empire, and I said the Soviets are
expansionist, they are aggressive, they
have ‘never withdrawn or retracted
Lenin’s statement that their mission is

system. And when 007 was shot down,
it veriﬁed what I believed about the
lack of respect for human life by those
in charge of the Soviet Union.

I believe that the only way there will
be a third world war is if the Soviet
Union wants it, because no one else
wants a war. We certainly don’t. We
know they don’t like our system, and
we don’t like theirs. But we have to see
if we can’t live in the world together.
So I think it is necessary that we face
each other.

Q: What was your feeling when
you decided to send American troops
into Grenada?

A: Radical Marxists had seized con-
trol of Grenada, and amid the turmoil,
the other small island states of eastern
Caribbean had asked our support to
free Grenada. And we knew there were
nearly 600 American medical students
on Grenada who could be held hostage.
We could not tolerate that.

So, with George Bush, the Special
Situation Group recommended that we
do what the Caribbean states had asked.
We would join in an international
operation although, of course, we pro-
vided the bulk of the force.

The hardest decision for a president
to make is the one that must order our
young servicemen to go someplace
where their lives will be endangered.
Regrettably, there were some deaths
during the Grenada landing. But I was
proud of all those young men in
uniform. One group of students had
crouched under their beds for hours
while bullets smashed through their
dormitory. Finally they heard an
American sergeant, a Ranger, call out
for them to come down. And when they
did, the young troops literally shield-
ed the students from ﬁre with their own
bodies while leading them to the
helicopters. ' .

Q: I’ve read that your role as
president of the Screen Actors Guild,
perhaps more than any other, shaped
your attitudes and your policies.
What did your experiences as a labor
leader teach you?

A: The Screen Actors Guild at the
time existed on some very ﬁrm prin-
ciples, one being that it would not
engage in politics. We believed that our
members were of every philosophy
and, therefore, there was no way that
by even a majority vote we had the
right to take a position politically that
might be counter to the views of some
members.

For two decades I participated in the '
negotiations of-the-ba~sic«conti:act with - ~

the producers. We had a test: Is it good
for actors, is it fair to the other fellow,
and is it good for the industry? If we
couldn’t answer yes to those three
things about an issue, we didn’t raise
that issue.

Then, during the mid-forties, com-
munists were ﬁghting for control of the
film unions and guilds. There were
threats of violence against guild
members, and against me personally.
It was then I learned something that
kind of set the stage for me as gover-
nor and, later on, here. There couldn’t
help but be times when I said to myself,
“Who am I to be making decisions for
thousands of actors whose careers are
at stake?” I finally decided the only
way I could sleep at night was if I did
what I honestly believed was right. I
might make a mistake, but that was
what we’d do. And with that rule, I do
sleep very well.

Q: How do you explain the
recovery of the U.S. economy?

A: I came into ofﬁce convinced that
government was taking too big a share
of the gross national product for itself,
that it had become adversarial in its
relationship with America’s en-
trepreneurs, that regulations had
become unnecessarily burdensome to
the people.

So the ﬁrst thing we did was cut the
red tape that was strangling the
economy. The number of federal rules
published by the various agencies fell
by more than 33 percent in our first

. term, and we eliminated hundreds of

unnecessary old ones. Each year we’ve
been here, the Federal Register, which
lists new regulatory actions, has grown
shorter. It’s now more than 41 percent
smaller than when we arrived.

In fact, for the taxpayers as well as
for the business people throughout the
United States, we have brought "-
through our various paper-reduction ef-
forts — a savings of some 300 million
man-hours in government-required

= paperwork.
the triumph of a world communist .

The most important thing we did as
far as getting the economy moving
again was cutting personal income

at the many issues around him

taxes by 23 percent through legislation
enacted in 1981. And look what hap-
pened: inﬂation went from 12.4 per-
cent to 3.6; the prime rate fell from
more than 20 percent to 9'/2. We
gained almost eight million jobs, while
the major industrial countries of
Europe lost more than a million jobs
over the past 10 years. There were
some 600,000 businesses incorporated
just last year. I was sure our program
was working when a number of critics
stopped calling it Reaganomics.

Q: Critics in Congress say your
Strategic Defense Initiative — “Star
Wars” — will be an enormously ex-
pensive boondoggle that is unlikely
to work. Many of our European
allies are cool to the idea, suggesting"
it will help destabilize the realtion-
ship between East and West and lead
to an even greater arms race. What
would you say to them?

A: When I ﬁrst decided to go for

strategic defense — and there was a lot
of well-intentioned advice not to do it
— a few politically active scientists
were being quoted in opposition. This
has really changed; now the question
is nolonger can we do this, but how
long.will it take and how much will it
cost? I think some of our allies had
reservations, but they have always ap-
preciated America’s capacity for
technological progress, and most of
them realize this is something we can
do together to make theworld a safer
place. I’m very encouraged; we’ve
made tremendous progress. New ideas
take time to be explained and accepted,
and we expected to have to do this.

Q: You have noted that the Soviets
have spent $500 million to prop up
a Marxist regime in Nicaragua, but
the House refused initially to commit
even $14 million to help the contras.
Funds have now been approved, but
why do you have such trouble con-
vincing the people that the contras’
cause is right?

A: Part of it is the sophisticated disin-
formation campaign the communist
bloc uses to confuse people. But we’ve
made mistakes, too, in some of the

terms we’ve used. I wish we’d done
something I’m going to do from here
on; if we had referred not to the San-
dinistas but the communists, not to the
contras but to the freedom ﬁghters, and
made it clear that the latter are people
ﬁghting in their country against a com-
munist takeover, then there might not
have been so much confusion.

And there is a holdover of the Viet-

nam syndrome — a -feeling that the‘

United States is sticking its nose into
something that’s none of our business.
Yet when you ask people in polls “Do
you think Nicaragua will become
another Cuba on the mainland of the
Americas?” they say yes.

We found, after I made that one
speech on the air about Nicaragua, that
there was a great turnaround. But the
disinformation keeps on.

Q: There are those in the State
Department and in various European
capitals who seem to wish that
[Lech] Walesa and Solidarity would
somehow go away so normal
diplomatic relations could be resumed.
What would you say to them?
them?

A: I do not believe this represents the
position of our State Department. What
proﬁt is there in working diplomatically
with a totalitarian government that will
not respond to the demands of its
citizens and shows little promise of
evolutionary change?

Q: Your first accomplishment in

I 1981 was to push through a huge tax
cut. Now you’re fighting for a
revamping of the entire tax code.
When didyou first start thinking
about what you call the disgraceful
inequities in the tax system?

A: Well, I’ve been aware of them
since my days in Hollywood when I
discovered that I was keeping only 10
cents out of every dollar. I also saw the
extravagances of tax shelters that made
no economic sense. And ﬁnally there
was the complexity of the tax forms.
I used to ﬁgure my own income tax,
but eventually I found it too com-
plicated. And I wasn’t alone. When the
income tax was enacted in 1913, the

tax code ran 15 pages. Now it’s almost .

2,500 pages, and the books of rules and
regulations ﬁll 28 volumes and seven
feet of shelf space.

In 1981, facing the recession, we ‘

couldn‘t think “reform.” We had to

cut the rates. But we said many times '

that we would come back with a pro-
gram that was fairer, simpler. And I
think we’ve done that. We want to
replace the current 14-bracket system
with three — 15, 25 and 35 percent.

By almost doubling the personal ex- '

emption, we will make it possible for
the average family of four earning up
to $12,000 to be dropped from the tax
rolls completely. For the rest of us,
seven out of 10 will pay at the
15-percent level. Ninety-seven percent
of us will pay no more than 25 percent
on the last dollar we earn.

we will keep the deductions for in- '

terest paid on principal-home mort-
gages and most other consumer loans.

Q: What makes you proudest of
America?

A: I think our Revolution was, vir-
tually, the ﬁrst time in man’s history
that a people said a government derives
its power from the people, that it can
have no power not voluntarily granted
by the people.

I was amazed one day to read the
Soviet constitution and to see that in
many places it said things similar to
ours about freedom of the press and
assembly and speech and religion. Of
course, they don’t practice any of that.
But there it was in writing.

And thengl realized that the Soviet
constitution means we, the govern-
ment, grant you, the people, these

rights. Our Constitution makes it clear '

that we, the people, grant the govern-
ment its rights. And anything not
delegated to the’ government’ still
belongs to the people. It is a profound
difference and it helps explain why -we
have remained free for so long.

Q: What worries you most about
America?

A: What gives me the greatest con-
cern is that for a while we seemed to

Patricia K: Over-Achiever

Patricia K. has a perfect 4.0 grade point average, is an accomplished musician,
member of the National Honor Society, and president of her school’s Drama Club. She is

the devoted daughter, as well as the friend in whom all others confide.

But it’s not enough. At 5'7”, and 85 pounds, Patricia K. thinks she’s fat. And now her

world is falling apart.

Patricia K., over-achiever, is starving herself to death.

National publicity has led to an increasing awareness of the devastating effects of
anorexia nervosa —- self-induced starvation — and bulimia — the binge-purge syndrome.

While anorexia and bulimia can affect anyone, most victims are females between the

ages of 10 and 34.

But help is available . . . at the greater Pittsburgh areas Anorexia Bulimia Treatment
and Education Center (ABtec-W) at The Medical Center of Beaver County. It has a- specially
trained staff to help you deal with your illness through a variety of services. This includes
an inpatient treatment program and an ABtec Support Group, which provides an opportu-
nity for open discussion of feelings, attitudes and behaviors associated with these eating

disorders.

For Patricia K. — and many others like her —— her biggest achievement is still within
reach: accepting the fact she needs help and getting back on the road to good health and

self-esteem.

be in danger of losing perhaps our most
unique characteristic —- the spirit of
volunteerism, of people banding
together to help one another. For a
while in the 19605 and 1970s, there was
a tendency to identify a problem and
with the best of intentions pass a great
government program to deal with it.

In the last several years, I think we
have reversed that trend. We have
returned responsibility to the states and
local governments. And we have en-
couraged the great volunteer efforts of
the American people.- The estimate is

that 92 million adult Americans are
engaged in some kind of volunteer
work every week — raising money for
charity, helping the needy, working in
hospitals, teaching adults to read. You
will ﬁnd that our cultural activities —
music, ballet, the theater, libraries —
are supported voluntarily to a greater
extent in this country than they are in
the rest of the world put together.

A hundred and ﬁfty years ago the
Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville
visited this country to ﬁnd out the
secret of our success. “America is
great because America is good,” he

has been quoted as saying. “And if
America ever ceases to be good,
America will cease to be great.” He
gave examples of how someone in the
community would see a problem, and
he would talk to a few neighbors about
it, and the next thing you knew, a com-
mittee was formed, and the people
were solving the problem without any
bureaucracy involved at all.

We still do. And I like it that way.

Food

continued from page 8
MUSHROOMS.

Advantage: low-calorie, low—fat
nutrition.

For those who have nibbled on car-
rot and celery sticks, raw mushrooms
provide a pleasing alternative. A cup
of the tasty fungi contains only 20
calories. They also make an elegant ad-
dition to clear soups, salads and main
dishes.

Mushrooms are well supplied with
potassium and phosphorus and are for-
tiﬁed with a healthy dose of biotin (a
B vitamin). But for some people they
can be asource of troublesome allergic
response. Eat with caution if you are
sensitive to foods containing yeast.

PASTA.

Advantage: carbohydrates, part 1.

ﬁnally received proper recognition as
an excellent source of carbohydrates,
the chief supplier of energy that fuels
all body functions, from muscle action
to the digestion and assimilation of
foods. The lengthy digestive process of
the complex carbohydrates in pasta
helps promote balanced blood—sugar
levels and a sustained release of
energy, perfect for extra stamina.
Note: Whole-wheat pasta offers the
added ﬁber beneﬁts of the whole grain.

POTATOES .

Advantage: carbohydrates, part 2.
Potatoes, like pasta, have the
undeserved reputation for being
anathema to dieters. In fact, a medium-
sized potato has only about 110
calo'ries. It is the butter or sour-cream

topping that adds the fat. On the other ,

hand, a potato crowned with crunchy

cheese makes a satisfying and healthful

In addition to their complex car-
bohydrates, potatoes supply a variety
of minerals such as magnesium, iron,
phosphorus and potassium. Enjoy
potatoes with their skins to maximize
their nutrition potential.

ORAN GES.

Advantage: vitamin C.

The orange is a great year—round fruit
providing an excellent source of
vitatnin C. It also packs bonus nutrients
in the forms of calcium and potassium
and is a good source of vitamin A. To
get the most of the orange’s nutrients,
plus the beneﬁts of its ﬁber, eat the fruit
itself rather than its juice. Whole
oranges tend to be less sweet than
orange juice (which often contains add-
ed sugar) and thus are beneﬁcial for
those with blood-sugar concerns.

Owls for

Panthers
run past

fifth win

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Philadelphia — Nothing comes easy
for the Pitt football team.

Saturday against Temple, with
leading rusher Charles Gladman’s ribs
forcing him to miss almost half the
game, it took a converted tailback to
enable Pitt to pull the game out 21-17.

At one point in the 1985 season,
tailback was the position where Pitt had
the most depth and talent. Gladman,
Brian Davis and A.B. Brown all con-
tributed in Panther victories. Freshman
Eugene Napoleon had potential and
also was ﬁghting for playing time.

Suddenly, tailback went from'Pitt’s
strongest to weakest position. Davis
has missed the past four games with in-
juries, while Brown and Napoleon both
quit the team realizing they must look
elsewhere to get sufﬁcient playing
time. ‘

Fullback Darnell Stone, 6-1, 215
lbs., was forced to play tailback. Stone

 answered the call with flying colors as

he gained 75 yards but /more important-
ly scored the winning touchdown from
two yards out early in the fourth
quarter.

“I feel great,” Stone said outside 8

Pitt’s locker room in Veterans Stadium.
“The opportunity ﬁnally came for me
to contribute, and I took advantage of
it.”

Stone carried for eight of nine plays

b in Pitt’s winning scoring drive. Stone

powered behind fullback Tom Brown,
moving the ball from Temple’s 36 to
pay dirt.

“We just ran off-tackle plays,”
Stone said. “And when you get the ball
a lot, you can make reads [on the

Pitt’s Darnell Stone came off the bench and gave a solid performance in Saturday’s 21-17 win over Temple.

defense] and make your cuts.”

Stoneand Gladman both received
opportunities as Pitt’s game plan was
to run the football. “We decided we
were going to run the ball today, ” Pitt
coach Foge Fazio said. “You see what
happens when we try to pass the ball.”

Saturday, Pitt quarterback John Con-
gemi did attempt 18 passes but com-
pleted only seven for a measly 46
yards. The running attack would be
Pitt’s weapon, do or die.

For a while, it looked like Pitt would

die. But with Gladman, between aches ‘

 

   

and pains, and Stone ru-nning behind a
determined offensive line, Pitt picked
up the road victory to up their record
to 5-4-1.

Temple shocked Pitt early by taking
a 10-0 lead. In fact, on the Owls’ first
offensive play, quarterback Lee Saltz
hit a speeding Willie Marshall down the
right sideline for 79 yards. Teryl
Austin, who would be burned all day
by Marshall (seven receptions for 183
yards), tripped him up at the one-yard
line. Saltz scored two plays later to give
Temple a 7-0 lead.

  
   

The Owls’ increased the lead on Bill
Wright’s 43-yard ﬁeld goal, which was
set up when Bill Rudison shanked a
32-yard punt out of bounds at his own
37-yard line.

Pitt rallied in the second quarter to
take a 14-10 lead before Temple scored
late in the first half to take a 17-14 lead
into intemiission.

Austin intercepted his sixth pass of
the year late in the ﬁrst quarter and
returned it 19 yards to Temple's
39-yard line to set up Pitt’s first
touchdown. Brown ﬁnished off a

seven-play drive by plowing in from
the one-‘yard line.

Pitt took a 14-10 lead with 9:15 re-
maining in the half when Gladman took
a pitch from Congemi and raced 34
yards untouched into the end Eone.

“I like those kind of plays,” Glad-
man said with a smile. “Whenever
someone is aching, he loves to score
untouched. It was just an option to the
right, and all I remember is seeing Tom
Brown ﬂattening his man.”

Pitt’s lead was short-lived as Tem-

Jim Urban/The Pitt News

Foge Fazio hopes he can ﬁeld a healthy squad against

   

Penn State.

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer '

The Pitt Panthers have now assured
themselves of at least a .500 record for
the season. Following their 21-17 win
over the now 4-6 Temple Owls, Pitt has
moved to 544-1 for the year. However,
the most important game of the season
lies ahead in two weeks when Pitt will
host the now No. 1 Nittany Lions at Pitt
Stadium.

It’s the pride of this Pitt football team
that was at stake Saturday, and the Pan-
thers didn’t allow that pride to be
beaten. Fifth-year senior Dennis Atiyeh
understands what the win did for him
and his teammates. ‘‘It’s definitely a
positive thing. We were in a hole a lit-
tle, but this Temple game will give us
more incentive.”

Brian Shields, also in his fifth
season, commented on the Temple win.
“As for Penn State, right now I feel
good. We’re now coming off a tough
win, but a win against a ﬁne team. It
will be sentimental.”

The Panthers will need more than
sentimental feelings and incentives
against Penn State. The most important
factor for the game is the extra week
of preparation and healing time that _the

. ’ The Pitt News, November 11, I985

Panthers’ bowl hopes still alive ?

Panthers will have.

For the seniors, it could be the last
game of their college careers. “It’s our
last game, so we’re going to do
anything we can to beat them,” said
senior quarterback John Congemi.

Defensive captain Bill Callahan
spoke for all his senior classmates, say-
ing, “We’re going to go out and win.
One last game is a game for the seniors.
Everyone has to go out and prepare for
it. We have a week off to heal our in-
juries and wounds, to come out and do
our best.”

Even with the much needed time off
and all the incentives in beating the No.
1 team, the question remains whether
Pitt can beat Penn State. Temple head
coach Bruce Arians thinks so.

“They’re [Pitt] capable of beating
anyone in the country. They’ve got as
good a talent as there is in the nation,
but they’ve got to play a whole lot bet-
ter than they did today to beat Penn
State.” ' —

Panther head coach Foge Fazio
knows his team must be sharp and well-
prepared in two weeks. “We need to
get some people healthy. We’ve got to
move the football, and we must be
more consistent on offense.We have to
be more consistent on defense too. We
can’t give up big plays, and the week

off looks good.”
Sophomore cornerback Teryl Austin

-..._.

makes it sound so easy. “What we‘

have to do is get everybody that’s in-
jured back together and continue to
work hard as we usually do, and things
will take care of themselves.”

However easy anyone tries to make
it sound, it won’t be.

If the ailing Panthers should win the
last game of the season, it will be in-
teresting to see if another last game will
come to this up-and—down football
team. Brian Shields sure would like to
see some post-season -action. “To
finish our last two games against two
tough opponents and to come off vic-

torious against Penn State, I think we”

deserve it [bowl trip],” said Shields.
“This team has been through a lot. It
would be nice, but I don’t know if
anyone deserves anything.”

Dennis Atiyeh has his own thoughts
concerning Pitt’s last game, whenever
that is. “Well, I hope that there is
another game. We have worked very
hard for another game,” said Atiyeh.
“If there isn’t, just beating Penn State
will be enough.”

Whether Pitt deserves a bowl oppor-
tunity or not is a question that will be
up to the bowl committee. As for the
Panthers themselves, only the Penn
State game matters at this point.

“We’re going to go out, we’re go- -

ing to win, and that’s going to make

IZIUDEIDDIJUDUDDCIEIDEIEJEIEIEJEJEICIDEIDEIIZIEIEIEIEIETEIEIEICIUEJ

our season. Then will have to see after
that,” Callahan remarked. ‘

For the second straight season, a win
over the Nittany Lions would certain-
ly help salvage another disappointing
year.

“We’re capable of winning, we
proved it last year. Nobody thought we
had a chance, and we beat them good,”
said Austin.

Penn State might well be No.1 when
they visit Pitt Stadium in two weeks,

A vacation. Everybody likes one.
Some people like to go to Hawaii, some
to Florida and some just stay at home
and relax. The Pitt football team will

.: take a vacation this week. Where will

they spend it? Try the Pitt training
room. Head coach Foge Fazio has the
training room booked solid through the
next two weeks, with virtually half his
squad suffering from one type of injury
or another.

“The week off looks really good,”
Fazio said after Pitt’s 21-17 victory
over Temple on Saturday. “It looks
damn good! We have a lot of people
that are hurt.”

The fourth—year head coach has two
weeks to prepare his squad for Penn
State in a game which may be his last
gasp as Pitt’s head coach. Fazio has_
watched his team dominate these same

- Nittany Lions the previous two years.

Penn State is currently undefeated and
ranked No. 1 in the nation, and Fazio

-would not have it any other way.

“I hope Penn State is No. 1 when
they come in here,” Fazio said eager-
ly on Saturday. He believes a win over
Penn State can salvage this up-and-
down year for the Panthers.

“You’re 6-4-1,” Fazio propheted.
“They are a winning team, they are a
bowl-bound team. You beat Penn
State, you are beating a helluva foot-
ball team.”

Fazio can look forward to Penn
State, but he must now face the task at
hand, which is nursing his players back
to health. Looking down the starting
lineup, there may be more injured
players than there are healthy players.

Offensively, tailback Charles Glad-
man, who broke the 1,000-yard plateau
on Saturday with 135 yards rushing, is
nursing a painful rib injury.

“They still hurt,” conﬁrmed Glad-
man. “My ribs bother me every week.
I think the two weeks off have got to
help,” Gladman added conﬁdently.
“The two weeks off will help.
Everybody will have a chance to get
healthy, and we will be ready for Penn
State.” .-

Joining Gladman on the injured list
from the offense are fullback Tom
Brown (sore leg), receiver Matt Sten-
nett (broken collarbone), tackle Ran-
dy Dixon (sprained ankle), running

back Brian Davis (bruised quad), '

receiver Reggie Williams (shoulder in-
jury), tight end Dave Shuck (broken
collarbone), tackle_Tony Brown (back),
center Barry Pettyjohn (knee) and run-
ning back Zeke Gadson (shoulder). The
list goes on and on.

Dcfensively, the picture is a little bit
brighter, but not much better. Defen-O
sive tackle Bob Buczkowski went down
against Temple with a hip pointer,

’ while defensive end Bill Sapio also is

bothered by a sore leg.

Senior nose tackle Dennis Atiyeh an-
chored, the defensive line in Bucz-
kowski’s absence, making eight
tackles. He, too, is looking forward to
the week off. -

“You think about the guys that we
have hurt on the team,” Atiyeh said.
‘ ‘Both our offensive tackles [Dixon and
Brown] played hurt today, our
linebacker [Brian Shields, sore ankle]
played hurt today, and our defensive
end [Sapio] played hurt also.

“Plenty of guys played hurt,”
Atiyeh continued, “ so when you talk
about a week, this will be a great ‘week
off for us.”

D.J . Dozier and Penn State come into Pitt Stadium in
two weeks.

As expected, Atiyeh is also ready for and win this one, then see what hap-

Penn State. “They can come in here
No. 80 or No. 1,” Atiyeh declared,
“and we will be ready for them. This
is a big game for us.”

“We have a week off,” added senior
safety Bill Callahan. “It’s a big game
for us. We have two weeks to prepare.
We just have to go out and give it our
best shot. We are just going to go out

pens.” _.

Callahan will feel the effects of the
off week personally. '

“The week off will help deﬁnitely,
even myself,” Callahan explained after
Saturday’s game. “I got injured out
there today. We have a lot of injuries,
so it will give us a chance to heal up,
and we’ll be ready.”

Panthers
ground

Temple

continued from page 13
ple tailback Todd McNair, subbing for
Paul Palmer, who has rushed for over
1,500 yards this season, scored from
a yard out. A pair of Saltz to Marshall
pass play of 13 and 28 yards set up the
score. -
Temple held the lead until Stone’s

.-touchdown midway through the fourth

quarter as the Pitt offense cou1dn’t
mount a drive. Late in the third quarter
Pitt drove from their 18-yard line to
Temple’s 47-yard line behind the run-
ning of Stone. However, the drive end-
ed when freshman ﬂanker Reggie
Williams dropped a Congemi pass on
third-and-seven.

Rudison pinned Temple in their own
territory by angling a punt out of
bounds at the 15-yard line. The
defense, backed by a Dennis Atiyeh
sack of 10 yards on third down forced
Temple to punt from their own end
zone, which would give Pitt good ﬁeld '
position. _

Austin returned Kip Shenefelt’s
40-yard punt 12 yards to the 36-yard
line, which set the stage for Stone’s
heroics. “Gladman was hurting,”
Fazio said. “So we decided to go with
Stone. Stone is a hard runner and he
can soften up the defense so we can put
Gladman back in."

Stone ran recklessly, gaining two,
ﬁve, ﬁve and then eight. After Stone
gained another three, Brown gained
eight on a trap moving the ball to the
ﬁve-yard line. It took Stone another
three attempts from there, but he danced
into the end zone from the two behind a
powerful block by left tackle Tony
Brown.

With a 21-17 lead and nine minutes
remaining, Temple didn’t die. Saltz,
who was 16 of 27 for 250 yards, went
to his favorite target, Marshall. They
teamed up twice for ﬁrst downs, driving
from_ their own 4-yard line to Pitt’s
43-yard line. The drive ended when
Temple tried some razzle-dazzle in at-
tempting to retake the lead.

Marshall, on a ﬂanker reverse, at-
tempted to throw long. Marshall proved
he is better at receiving as he underthrew
the intended receiver by 15 yards. “It
was just a reverse ﬂee-ﬂicker,” said Pitt
cornerback Ducky Lewis, who in-
tercepted the pass. “I just happened to
be in the right place at the right time.”

Gladman, who rushed for 135 yards

- in only 17 carries, returned to help Pitt

run out the clock. He gained 27 yards
on a big third-and-ﬁve, moving the ball
into Pitt’s territory.“He’s just a great

back,” Fazio said of Gladman.

Gladman moved the ball deep into
Temp1e’s territory before fumbling
with 2:14 remaining, giving Temple
one last shot. But the defense came
through, allowing only eight yards in
four plays. ‘

“Outside of that long bomb on the
first play of the game,”said Fazio, “I
thought the defense played very well.
This was a must win for us. We didn’t
want to go into the Penn State game
with a losing record.”

Pitt will enjoy a week off before bat-
tling the top-ranked Nittany Lions, and
the team is anxiously awaiting the big
showdown. p _

“If the bowl bids come after the
Penn State game, we will go to a
bowl,” Gladman said. “We should
beat Penn State. We will be ready.”

“I think they might come in here No.
1 and just leave with a loss,” Stone
said.

If Pitt does beat Penn State, will that
salvage this season of inconsistency?
Undoubtedly yes, according to Fazio.
“Damn right," Fazio said. “Penn
State's a damn good football team, and
if we win, we‘re 6-4-1, and that’s a win-
ning record."

It won‘t be easy.

  

The Pitoccer team came up short Dave Hvvker/The Pitt News

Pitt squeezed  b

Orange in Big East

A season of unparalleled ac-
complishments for the Pitt soccer team
ﬁnally came to a halt over the weekend
in the Big East Championships. The
Panthers fell in the opening round, 2-0,
to the Syracuse Orangemen. Head
coach Joe Luxbacher’s squad ﬁnished
out the year with a record of 11-4-2.
Despite the loss, Luxbacher was hap-
py with the performance of his squad.

“I felt that we didn’t play as strong
as we could have,” Luxbacher said
after the game, “but I was happy with
the effort the team gave.”

Pitt went down 1-0 early in the match
as a result of a freak play. The ﬁrst
Syracuse goal came when Scott Ow-
siany lofted a corner kick into the goal
area. After being deﬂected by a
Syracuse player, the ball skated off the
shoulder of an unidentified Pitt
defender and into the net to give the
Orangemen a lead they would not
relinquish. ‘

After a brief period of confusion, of-
ﬁcials decided not to award the goal to
any specific Syracuse player.
Regardless, the goal still counted on the
scoreboard, and the Panthers went in-
to the locker room at the half trailing
by a_point.

“I was a little disappointed with the
play of the team in the ﬁrst half,” Lux-
bacher said, adding, “We played like
we should in the second half.”

It was not enough, however, as Ow-

siany iced the game late in the second _

half off a pass from teammate Ken
Zieira.

Pitt’s 11-4-2 record is the best in re-
cent years for Pitt soccer. Ofﬁcials
were not sure last night just how the
record compared with Leo Bemis’
NCAA Tournament teams from the
’50s, but, regardless, it is a record that
Lpxbacher and his squad can be proud
0 .
(Editor ’s Note: Syracuse eventually
won the tournament, defeating Con-
necticut in the ﬁnal, I-0)

The Pitt News, November 11, 1985

IS LOUIS FARRAKHAN ANTI-SEMITIC 2

I. am opposed to Rev. Farrakhan if he says bad things about the Jewish people, but I haven't
heard him say anything of the sort. L
Di’. BCll'bCll'Cl Sizemore, acting chairwoman of the Department of Black Studies,

Pitt News, Nov. 6, 1985 _ « ‘
“He [Louis Farrakhan] does not represent anti-semitism as alleged, but he does represent a

strong black society.”   ,
Camille Y. White, Deputy Chairman of the Black Action Society, Pitt News, Nov. 6, 1985.

Hitler was a Great Man

' “Here come (sic) the Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well that’s a good

name. Hitlerwas a very great man.”  
Louis Farrakhan, March 11, 1984 radio address

Jews Control the Media

“As long as Jews control the media, Arabs, Blacks, Muslims will never have a balanced

View", Louis Farrakhan, Columbus Dispatch, April 16, 1985
Judaism is a Gutter Religion
Farrakhan said Israel has had no peace in nearly four decades “and she will  never have

any peace because there can be no peace structured oninjustice, lying, and using the
name otGodto shield yourgutter religion under his holy and righteous name.”
. Louis Farrakhan, Newsday, June 26, 1984 (Note: Farrakhan later

asserted his reference to Judaism was ”Your dirty religion.'’) .
Black Leaders who Seek Jewish Support Should be Killed

When Farrakhan asked the crowd what should be done with black leaders who seek
Jewish support, someone shouted: “Kill Them.” 1
Farrakhan replied: ‘‘I didn’t say it. l just second the motion.”
Louis Farrakhan, A.P. dispatch printed in Newsday, Aug. 19, 1984

Jews are Wicked

“Jews know their wickedness, not just Zionism which is an outgrowth ofJewish
transgression  I intend to raise the ante tonight ! Black people will not be controlled

by Jews, Black leaders will either come out for us, orget the hell away from us. Who is your ”
master — God or Jewish leaders?” ‘ d
  Louis Farrakhan, Washington Post, July 27, 1985

Jewish Influence will Destroy America 1

“The Jewish leadership is spirituallyblind. If the American government and the Reagan

administration allow such lobby which is so spiritually blind to have the great power to

influence the guidance of this nation then they will guide this nation to its destruction.”
Louis Farrakhan, speech to the National Press Club, July 30, 1984 J
