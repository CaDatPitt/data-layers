Students sauntered into the

lower lounge of the W/illiam.

Pitt Union last night for a meet
and greetithat was supposed to
expose them to representatives
from both sides of the political
spectrum. I

When several politicians didn’t
show, the event, which was spon-

sored  the College Democrats,

College Republicans and the Stu-
dent Vote Coalition, turned into
a pseudo—rally for the Democratic
Party.

State Sen: Jay Costa, D-Al-
legheny, U.S._. Rep. Mike Doyle,
D-Pittsburgh, and State Rep. Dan
Frankel, D—Allegheny, spoke with

students both in small groups and '

in mass about topics ranging from
what careers they should pursue

‘to why they, should register to

vote in western Pennsylvania as

, opposed to in their home state, if ‘

.it’s different. ’
U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-
Allegheny, was scheduled to ap-

pear at the meet and ’gre_e_tp but

got stuck at an‘ event Downtown,

both the CollegeiRepublicans and

Year-long Week awaiting Greeks

by Samantha Seaman

Staﬁ’ Writer
Blood will be lost" by both greeks and

non—greeks alike thisyear, if Pete Hammerle

has  to say about it.

A Greek Week Overall is a series of events
that occur, despite its name, throughout the
year and bring together the Interfraternity
Council, Panhellenic Council and the Na-
tional Panhellenic Community.

“We’re the ‘fun side’ of greek life,” said

’ Pete Harnrnerle, one of the Greek Week,

leaders. ‘ .

Hammerle,’ along with Alexandra Con-
lon, organizes most of these greek events.
They were responsible for teaming up with

TPitt’s Athletic Department for last week’s

 Night, the kickoff event of this school
year.‘ But it’s not all fun and games;

cali 412-648-5392;; it

One of these events will_be the first of
many blood drives, _ which will be held in
both the William Pitt Union and the Petersen
Events Center Oct. 6-10. — P

Greek Week has _,a partnership with Cen-

tcal Blood Bank because the donations “go to ‘

people in Pittsburgh,” said Conlon. She said,
“Even American_ Red Cross goes to people
elsewhere,” as well as outside of the city.

“One donation save; three lives,” she said,
calling for all students ——- not just greeks —
to get involved. . 1

Greek Week has also joined up with Resi-
dence Ilife this year in the hopes of getting

.more students to participate. Harnmerle
emphasized, “Greek Week is not just about

greeks.”
_ This year, Harnrnerle and Conlon are
working to make an array of changes within

the greek community on campus.
,“Alex and I came into this year with a

few goals,” said Hammerle, “chief among.

them to increase participation, because it
has dropped off in recent years. Second, [we
want] to increase accountability to the stu-
dents and to us.”

“If people don’t get feedback, how do we
know if we’re doing our jobs? And third, we
want to change things and bring the focus
back to the University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute,” he said.

Greek Week has pledged to raise $500,000
for lung and thoracic cancer research. This
is more than any other student organization
has donated, said Harnmerle.

Every event throughout the year will have
a representative from UPCI there, said Ham-
merle. ‘.‘We may be playing dodgeball, but it’s

two areas, but it’s hard for politicians to
know the ins and outs of all the subjects
on which they render decisions. So, they

_approach analysts because “you really do

need to hear both sides.”

Baurnwell said he appreciated the irr-
sight heogot from D’oyle.But it’s possible
he valued, the experience of talking to him

i even more.

“[The'polit:icians] really do seem to be
interested in. us, not just getting the party
out, but getting the youth out,” said Baum-
well. “They’re put so high up on a pedestal.
You realize they’re not just ‘talking heads.’

, You realize they’re people.” ,‘

About 45 minutes into the event, each
of the politicians introduced himself to the
roughly 60 or 70 students who attended.

Doyle told students that western Penn-
sylvania was going to be “Ground Zero”
for the presidential election. .

“There is no] math that I’ve seen that
[Democratic candidate] Barack Obama
can be president without Pennsylvania,” he
said. ‘,‘We can do it without Ohio. We can
do it ‘without Florida. We can’t do it with-
outiPennsylvania.” S

‘:._..

  Costa emphasizes  

state and local politics

4

Frankel told students that because Penn-
sylvania is a swing state, Pittsburgh was one
of the best places from which they could

experience the upcoming election.

, “You’re here, and we’re excited about
it,” said Frankel. “I’ve been through two
presidential cycles here at the Universityof
Pittsburgh and  it’s an extraordinary ex-
perience. You’re gonna see Obarna. You’re
gonna see [Republican candidate] McCain.”
Costa rounded off his introduction to the
group by emphasizing the importance of
local and state politics. _

“What takes place at the state level
reaches you and touches you,” he said.

1 “The legislative races at the state level are

also important.”

Earlierin the evening, /Geiger, the presi— ’

dent of -the College Democrats, was en-
couraging students to register to vote in

Pittsburgh, as opposed to their hometown.

“They live here nine months out of the
year,” said Geiger. “The issues that affect
them most aren’t whataffects them while
they’re at home being taken care of by their
parents.” « ;

for a reason,” he said.- 1 e - .

. One such event plannedis the Pitt Dance
Marathon. The 24-hour groove-a-thoin is
tentatively scheduled for Nov. . 15-16. Student
groups will be ableito sponsor dancers, and
the dancers’ fee goes straight to UPCI. A

Greek 1ife’s biggest  event of
the year, PDM'rai'sed tens of thousands, of
dollars last.year, as everyfraternity and soror-
ity donated $675.00_to have a dancer partici-

i pate, according to its Website. ‘

‘Aside from working with the cancer in-
stitute, the Greek Week leaders‘ have several
other ideas up their sleeves. ‘ V 

Coming up on Oct. 18 is the Pitt Make a

Difference Day. The day is going to be dedi-‘

cated to community service and cleaning up
the‘ city. Greek Week plans to make .its conni-
bution to the citywide project in the form of
500 volunteers for the cause. _ S

Greek Week is also working with Pine
Student Vote Coalition by adding a little com-'
petition between the-houses this fall.

Harnmerle and Conlon plan to distribute
voter registration cards to the greek houses
on campus,  them to fill out as many
as possible The houses get points for every

student registered, no matter the party affili-

ation. _ . ‘
Atlthe end of the year formal, the greek
house with the most total points wins the
contest. '  i -
Another change alreadyset in motion by
Conlon and Hammerle is further coordina-

tion with the National Panhellenic 'Cornmu- I
.  “We haven’t done much with them in the

past and are very excited to change that,” said
-Hamrnerle. . i P P '
He" and Conlon are already plarming

‘ monthly meetings with the ~Panhellenic_Com-

munity, and they would like to do an event
 them sometime soon. i
The bottom line? i
“Students should expect a different Greek

pWeek than in the past,” said Conlon. ‘We _ ..
want to change the status quo.”

Activity Center nurtures family bonds

room, and healthy snacks, was the joint project
of several local organizations.

The Pittsburgh Child Guidance Founda-
tion, which promotes the mental health of
children 12 and under, and Lydia’s Place, a
group that helps female offenders and their
families, collaborated with the  and solicited
donations from more than 100 individuals and
community organizations to build the activity
center.

According to Allegheny County’s Web site,
the activity center cost more than $400,000 in
donations and more than $40,000 worth of
volunteer hours.

jail Warden Ramon Rustin said he was
pleasantly surprised to see so many people
come together to help the inmates’ families.

Rustin said the  often gets overlooked.
“lt’s where the criminals are. People are pun-
ished. [But] we know it’s just a temporary situ-
ation. They all get out.”

The inmates are more likely to have a
smooth transition into “normal life” if they
have a strong support system, Rustin said.
That’s where the family comes into play.

Families of the incarcerated seek nor-
malcy

But building and  that relation-
ship isn’t always easy.

‘‘\When an inmate has been gone,  are
very different in that household. It can be very
traumatic to the inmate and the household,”
said Rarr1on.

Sometimes, the inmates will leave  not
knowing their child’s favorite color or favorite
food, said Claire Walker, executive director of
the Pittsburgh Child Guidance Foundation.
The children and their caregivers, she added,
will often aslg “Where were you when I need-
ed you?”

It’s not that the two parties don’t want to
know and understand each other, W/alker said.
Often times, they don’t know how to get start—
ed.

The key to developing those relationships,

Sometimes the caregivers lie to the children

The guidance foundation and the  are
working to provide counseling for the inmates
and their families after they leave the jail. In the
meantime, they’re  to make the  visits
as pleasant as possible.

“Children’s attachments to their parents
are the most critical elements of their lives,”
said Walker. “When children aren’t helped to
maintain those relationships, there are lifelong
consequences. We can help them see their par-
ents and see them in a realistic sense.”

praise for the efforts of volun-
 teers who helped put itrogether.
And with good reason. The
wait time at the  is at least one
3 hour to see a visitor and can eas-
ﬁily stretch beyond that mark to
itwo or more hours. Two hours
‘ in a cramped room with a small,
grestless child and nothing to do
would not likely rank highly on a
jlist of how most people want to

 spend their time, and so it’s good ~

3 to see a community group doing
isomething to make families feel
 more welcome.
, So, all things being equal, the

3 Family Activity Center seems like
f a pretty good program, especially
considering it was built using do-
i nated funds and volunteer labor,
iwhich exceeded $400,000 and
« 2,000 hours, respectively.
Perhaps the best thing about
the program is that it offers a
support net both to inmates of
the  and their families. Inmates
often have a hard time receiving
visitors, and having a strong fam-
ily support system is believed to
‘help lower recidivism rates and
keep parolees out of trouble. The
T center encourages families to vis-
it inmates, allowing this support
A to extend into the  itself.
And it also helps to make

children less uncomfortable, en-

couraging parents or other family 
members to bring them along for 1
a visit instead of making the trip 

alone.

At a time when youth arrests 
are on the rise and the number 1
of inmates in jails and prisons is 
growing to the boundaries of the 
system’s ability to facilitate them, 
keeping people out of jail has 

never been more important.

The Family and Corrections ¥
Network states that one of every 
40 children in the United States 
has a parent behind bars, and that 
in many of these cases the family 
loses the ability to care for chil- A

dren as they deal with the situa-
tion. There are also statistics that
draw a link between a child hav-

to see twopolitical parties and an
entire nation focusing their ener-
gies toward helping the Gulf Coast
this time around, even if it turns
out Gustav’s destructive force is no
match for Kattina’s.

But is anyone optimistic enough

to believe that everyone’s inten-
tions here are entirely genuine? A
quick fact check from TheHill.com:
Of the four major players in the
upcoming general election, Palin

— wasn7t in a major ofﬁce at the time,

and neither Obama, McCain, not
Biden had personally seen the dev-
astation  the New Orleans area
within half a year of the-ﬂoods.
That’s not to say they were en-
tirely indifferent to it._iObarna vol-

unteered his help with evacuees in
Houston, McCain proposed a bill
to divert oil proﬁts to hurricane vic-
tims, and Biden’s own son was sent
' to the Gulf Coast as‘ a member of
the National Guard while his wife
personally delivered supplies to the
area. t t -
. This time,’ however, you can
count on some timely trips down to
Louisiana, with plenty of magazine-
friendly photo-ops for all of them.
McCain and Palin have already

accepted Mississippi Gov. Haley‘

Barbour’s offer to travel south and
provide som,e last-minute relief ef-
forts. 

It’s astounding how generous
these politicians are all of a sudden.
It’s even more amazing how quick
to respond they are this time around

with the eyes of a nation watch-

- ing in the middle of two national

conventions. Although Joe Biden
had‘ to keep his usually loquacious
tongue in‘ check at the Labor Day
parade, perhaps I should write to
him and tell him how disappointed
I am that I didn’t get to hear him
speak. Maybe I could drop in the
fact that I could use another one
of those refund checks right about"
now. “Sincerely, Undecided Swing-
State Voter.” 7

The lesson here? If your city is

To the Editors,

The article “Israel and America share a colonial past” lacks .factual
evidence. There are two points I would like to refute.

First, Israel is not a_ colonial state. Colonization implies two things:
Monetary gain and a minority ruling a majority. Israel ﬁts neither of
these categories.,\X/hen Jewish Pioneers began legally buying ‘land from
the Syrian landowners, the land was desolate desert and swampland.

Israel also cannot be deﬁned as a colonist state because Israelis are
the majority in Israeli territory. In Palestinian territories, areas of high
Arab concentration are ruled by Arab municipalities. The areas ruled by
Hamas or Fatah have their own police force, social services and govern-
ment. T I I ‘

The second point is that Israel has attempted to make peace multiple
times, to the point of even‘ being willing to dismantle settlements. How
about the Camp David Accords when Ehud Barak offered Yasser Ara-
fat 97 percent of iwhat he wanted from Israel? .

- If it was about settlements, compromises could have been made. .

Israel has even returned land for the hope of peace, such as the Gaza
Pullout when Israeli troops uprooted thousands of Israeli citizens.
What Israel got inreturn is constant rocket ﬁre on border towns like
Sderot. I

To the'Editor,

In the editorial “Palin’s Appeal,” the selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah

Palin is given an assuming nudge. It ‘implies that there‘ is a chance that .

Palin could become a surrogate Hillary Clinton in the absence of the
Democratic hopeful in the 2008 presidential election. That is a mis-

I taken and ‘dangerous assumption for anyone — especially Sen. John
‘McCain — to make about Clinton supporters.

Clinton supporters didn’t merely stand for someone with the same
reproductive organs as them. They stood for so much more: universal
health care for each and every American, fair taxes on the middle class;
a responsible end to a senseless war and a strong, ‘experienced candi-

date with leadership credentials. It just hnappenedethat this candidate

was ‘a powerful woman. Merely picking someone who happens to be a
woman is not enough to woo women to McCain’s ticket.

Palin’s far right-wing, out-of-this-stratosphere stances on science.‘

education, abstinence—only sex education, abortion and other “values”

issues are exactly the oppositethings thatmany womenstand for.«They

are the least of their concerns in an election about a broken economy,
failing foreignpolicy and_ changing environment. McCain should be
ashamed of himself for thinking women’ are that stupid.

Get ready to throw back a beer
(or 10) and get your vote on.

The Magic Hat Brewing Co.,

‘known for itsieclectic branding and

ﬂavorful beers, is hosting a Shad r-
side pub crawl this_Saturday. The
event is hosted in conjunction with
HeadCount, an organization intent
on registering new voters by reintro-
ducing the democratic process back
into the bar scene .

Because naturally, politics and de-

mocracy go hand in hand with alco-

“The Bill of Rights and the Con-
stitution were written in bars and
tavernsfi says Magic Hat owner
, and founder Alan Newman;
“The idea is to go back to the
forefathers.” ‘ A 1 ~

the concept four presiden-

litical events were striking a
little too close to home for

or 12 years ago. Bars were

up because they were 
seen as places whereyoung
‘kids went to get drunk or
get laid I’ve alwaysibeen a

. For college students, this
is a refreshing point of
view that is certainly iden-

. tiﬁable today, despite the
stereotypes‘ associated with
college students and drink-

cussion back to the bars and taverns.

ﬂag in front of a bull. I talked about
 political discussion back to
bars, and people laughed at me They
said nobody’s ‘gonna give a shit,” said
Newman. ‘

But people did. The first event
Magic Hat held around this idea was
not actually a pub crawl at all, but a
political discussion held in local bars
spaced out over four days;

“The first surprise was people
actually showed up,” said Newman.
‘The second surprise wasithat not
only did people show up, burithey
paid attention to the presentation.

’ i The biggest surprise was that
after the presentation’ ended, instead
’of people leaving, everybody stayed
and continued the conversation. I
said, ‘This is pretty damn coo ”’

Now, three presidential elections

later, the event has grown consider-

ably and is ﬁnally coming to Pitts-
burgh. At the bars, both Magic Hat
and HearlCount workers will be reg-
istering attendees to vote, as well as
 out discussion books meant
to encourage people to talk about
issues most relevant to Pittsburgh
residents. A

political discussion could yield argu-

mentative results? i 7

has never encountered a. problem,

Graphics cards for

more than just gaming

by Donald Campbell .0
Staﬂ W/riter

\X/ill computers eventually be built
from only graphics cards? Perhaps not
your ' run—of-the—mill Dell desktop quite.
yet, but the scientiﬁc computers that are
used for number—crunching and experi-
mentation may very well lmove that way
soon. A new application for the vener-
able display devices may put Graphi-
cal Processing Units, or GPUS, in the
world of heavy—duty scientiﬁc computing.

Ever since Intel became a ﬂedgling
company "producing its ﬁrst general-pur-
pose processors, one rule has governed
the development of processors. Every two
years, the number of transistors on a chip
should double. 1 The computing industry
has managed to avoid deviating from this
rule, yet Intel has seen problems on the
horizon for quite some time. As general-
purpose processors, such as the Intel chip
that powers your laptop, have gotten to be
more and more complex, they have begun
to consume more and more power.

Attempting to design a chip with a
single processing core that canperform
the throughput required of high—end sci-
entiﬁc vcomputing would be power—hun-
gryd to the point of -being unaffordable.

Cue the development of the In-
tel Core series of dual and quad—core
processors. -By splitting up the respon-
sibility of computing between mul-
tiple processing cores, a computer can
do ‘rriore while consuming less power.

_Despite individual processors being
multi—cored, some computing problems,
require astronomical number—crunching
that general-purpose Intel chips are not
necessarily designed for. Previous wis-
dom has been to simply string many Intel
general-purpose chips together and have

— . them communicate to each other and share

processing load. In other words, solve the
throughput problem by creating a cluster.
The old wisdom is being challenged,
however, as companies like AMD,’ which
ownsthe graphics card company ATI, are
beginning to rethink the processors used

in scientiﬁc clusters. AMD is attempting

to move away from the general-purpose
-processors that dominated clustering and
replace them with QPUS. Until now, GPUS
have been mainly utilized in graphics

~ cards. ‘

Graphics cards" are speciﬁcally well-suit-
ed for high—intensity computing. The very
nature of graphicsprocessing lends itself
to impressive feats of number-crunching.

After all, computer games simply ﬁgure out
angles, sizes of objects‘ (to give the illusion
of depth), etc. And to make a game truly
memorable and truly attractive to play, a
high—powered graphics card performs such
calculations constantly and at lightning-fast
speed.

AMD created the Tesla computing sys-
tem. forilarge cluster processing. The Tesla
computing system utilizes four GPUS, each
capable of eating through mathematical al-
gorithms voraciously. When put together,
calculations can be performed in parallel.
The Tesla computer also boasts “hyper-
threading” technology, greatly, increasing
the speed of the connections between
the different processors. Hyper—threading
greatly speeds up processor performance.

_Technology for the Tesla GPUS was tak-

en from high-performance ATI graphics
cards.

Many GPUS, including the GPUs uti-
lized in the Tesla machines, have their per-
formance boosted by the ability to handle
more data at one time than the standard
general-purpose processor. The Tesla pro-
cessors are capable of shufﬂing around
128 bits of data at a time — compared to
the 32 or 64 bit data structures utilized by
general-purpose computers. The processor

utilized in the Playstation 3 gaming console,’

dubbed the “Cell” processor, also contains.
some 128-bit data storage.

Many scientists are attempting cheaper
clustering techniques, including the use of
comparatively inexpensive consumer elec-
tronics. The Playstation 3 contains proces-
sors that are so advanced and so fast that
multiple Playstation 3 units, when working
together, can be considered a high-through-
put supercomputer. The Cell processor, sit-
ting at the heart of the Playstation 3,‘ was
inspired by GPU design andgis capable of
crunching numbers with unbelievable hun-
ger. For many schools and nonproﬁt re-
search organizations, the relatively low cost
of the Playstation 3 — when compared to
conventional supercomputers — means that
scientiﬁc cluster computing may move into

the realm of feasibility.

The future will hold many advances for ,

supercomputing. Intel and AMD alike will

continue to offer high‘ throughput pro-

cessors for number-crunching. AMD has
started a ﬂurry of brainstorming, however,
as it has"recognized the beneﬁts and possi-
bilities of using graphics cards to perform
complex mathematical operations. Perhaps
general-purpose computers will also ben-
eﬁt, as powerful graphics cards are given
more processing responsibility.

Pitt line, receivers need to step up  

    

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

Aftera strong startanda 140 lead,

it was the Pitt offense that stumbled
Saturday afternoon against 
Green.

And heading into t.his weekend, it
can’t afford to do the same — especial-

ly against a Buffalo team that scored
an impressive 42 points last weekend
against Texas El-Paso.

During Pitt  Dave Wannst-
edt’s post-game press conference Sat-

urday, he said the
oﬁense needed to
ﬁnd a way to elim-
inate turnovers
and score some
more points.

But in order to
score those points,
the offensive line
needs to step up
and make some
plays. It needs to
blod< for Bill Stull
and give him time
to air out the ball
and keep the de-
fense honest. And
it needs to keep

Pitt Women take home first win of young season

by Randy‘Lieherman
Staff Writer

Missed opportunities and
mental errors hurt, but this
Weekend they didn’t cripple Pitt’s
women’s soccer team, which
split its two games in the Uni-
versity of Illinois soccer tourna-
ment held in Champaign, Ill.

Still, Pitt coach Sue-Moy Chin
said she saw a lot of heart from
her entire team in the tourna-
ment. .

“We wanted to win the tour-
nament,” said Chin. “But more
importantly, we wanted a really
good effort [in which] we were
focused on the details. We ac-
complished those goals, but we
had some mental breakdowns,
and we learned from the lessons
of the ﬁrst two losses.”

Pitt junior Ashley Habbel
and sophomore Liz Carroll were

named to the all-tournament
team. Habbel notchedpthe 12th
and 13th goals of her career,
pushing her into third place on
Pitt’s all-time career scoring list.
Habbel needs just six more goals
to break the school record held

by Cande Ruiz (18 goals from,

1998-2001).

Pitt [1-2-0] continues play
with its ﬁrst home game Friday
night against the University of
Pennsylvania at Founders Field.

Dayton 3, Pitt 2

The Panthers fell behind 2-0
in the first half after Dayton
out-shot them, 14-5. But Pitt
bounced back and dominated
the second halﬁ out-shooting
Dayton, 6-4, tying the game at
two goals each and controlling
possession for most of the half.

Junior Katie Caslin ‘scored

Pitt’s first goal in the 71 st minute.
Caslin ripped a shot past Day-
ton’s goalkeeper after controlling
a loose ball in the penalty box.
Katie’s twin sister, Maura Caslin,
assisted her on the play. _

Just six minutes later, fresh-
man Katelyn Ruhe scored the
Panthers’ second goal after ﬁn-
ishing a rebound shot.

“We started out playing‘ re-
ally strong,” said coach Sue-Moy
Chin. “We had a mental error to
allow their ﬁrst goal, and then
they scored off a corner kick,
which was just us not concen-
trating enough and picking up
the ball.”

The two teams played the
final 12 minutes of regulation
time without a goal, forcing
overtime.

Dayton’s Kelly Blumenshein
scored the game-winning goal at
the 103259 mark, giving the Fly-

ers the 3-2 victory. Blumenshein
controlled the ball and ﬁred a
shot into the goal’s lower right:
corner after a shot bounced off
a Pitt defender right to her.

“We didn’t clear the ball,”
said Chin of the double-over-

time goal. “The ball probablyi

A day ﬁlled with food, beer and  mustaches

by Adam Littman

. Senior Staﬁ’ W/ritcr
The smell of beer and ciga-
rette smoke that overwhelmed
the air for more than an hour was
gone, replaced with the scent of

diculous,” said Jarrett Katawczik,
a founder of the event and 2003
Pitt graduate. '

Katawczik now lives in Cali-
fornia but came back to Pitts-
burgh for the long weekend and

weekend. '
The area where the event took

place wasn’t difﬁcult to spot once *

in the parking lot. On a beam, the
group hung three posters. One
pictured the Panther logo with a

a grill cooking hot
dogs and hamburg-ég
ers.

Since it was only
11 a.m. it could only
mean that football
season had once
again started.

But most of the
people occupying
parking lot Red 7D
met a rare obstacle
while trying to get
a full whiff of the
surrounding aroma:
mustaches.

Before Pitt’s game

What do men over 40
like? Mustaches, beer,
football. So why not
bring them together?

Musgrave

mustache and the
phrase “Just Grow
It” printed on top.
Another poster
featured the event’s
logo, which was a
cartoon circle with
eyes, legs and a gi-
gantic mustache.
The ﬁnal poster
was a movie poster
for _“Anchorman”
with the event’s
creators’ faces put
%  into the photo,
W i as the movie was

the theme for this

against Bowling
Green on Saturday,
more than 80 people gathered for
the fourth annual Wann-stache
Bash, a tailgate party celebrating
Pitt football and, more impor-
tantly, Pitt football coach Dave
Wannstedt’s mustache, before the
season’s opening home game.
“He’s so famous for his
’stache, and we just wanted a rea-
son to do something fun and ri-

the Bash.

“It serves as a reunion of
sorts,” said Nick Elliot, another
founder of the party and 2003
Pitt graduate.

Elliot said the other two
founders of the event live in the
Pittsburgh area, as does he, but
people come from as far as Cali-
fornia and Florida for the long

year’s event.

And if the
signs weren’t enough, there were
the mustaches. Nearly all of the
attendees sported some sort of
facial hair.

Witliin the group of musta-
chioed party-goers, there were
varying degrees of upper-lip
growth.

Some mustaches were thin
and hardly visible, while others

were bushy and dark for all to
see. Some ended at the corner of
the mouth, and others went to
the end of the lips, took a turn
southbound for the chin, and
possibly went all the way down
to the neck. Female tailgaters
donned, presumably, fake mus-

’ taches for the event.

While the mustaches differed

‘from person to person, most

people wore the same shirt. It was
the ofﬁcial Wann-stache Bash 4
T—shirt, with the event’s logo on
the front-of the shirt, with the
“Anchorman” poster on the back.
One person wore last year’s shirt,
when the event had a Mexican
theme, and the back of the shirt
read “Bash de Wann-stache,” and
had a picture of Wannstedt in a
sombrero.

Elliot commented that
Wannstedt’s mustache is worthy
of inspiring the event because of
the sheer bravado it takes to wear
such a ’stache.

“It has a bit of reckless aban-
don to it,” he said. “It’s easily one
of the best all-time mustaches in
sports.”

Both Elliot and Katawczik
said they keep the area between
their upper lip and nose naked
throughout the year but grow

the mustaches for the event. 
liot’s was a Fu Manchu, where
the ’stache curves the eng, of the
lips and goes down to the chin;
Katawczik went with a more tra{
ditional look, but he said he grew
his for most of the month, ‘so it
was fairly thick. .

Elliot said he hopes ._«j.urren‘..
Pitt students will join in 
Wann-stache bashes. 7

“We want it to be something
fun and something that gets therr
interested in coming down here
to support the football team.” S

Juniors Nick Lazaro, Petei

Duke and Rob Musgrave, whci

all attended the event and grevg
mustaches, said the mustache
could grow to be a Pitt footbal
ritual. <5» i
“We need something to ge‘;
people to come to games, an(
the mustache just might be it,’
said Musgrave. “It could beou;
tradition that everyone grows 2
mustache for the first game of
the season.” - 
Lazzaro also said the mus;
tache could also be a way to 
back alumni. -
“What do men over 40 like?"T
he asked. “Mustaches, beérr, footi
ball. So why not bring them to%
gether.” 5

ties up and bringing pressure into
the pocket, the quarterback has little
time to make the reads and decide
on a pass_If the offensive line stands
strong and  Stull a few seconds,
his receivers should have enough
room to operate and ﬁnd the open
space. Pitt’s receivers have favorable
size over most corners and can take
advantage of the coverage. ’

The play—action pass could help
Pitt reach shorter as well, as ithas
more options than just the deep-ball.
And even a short pass has the chance
to develop into something big if the
majority of the defense’s secondary is
behind the receiver.

Thisplayis similartowhatwe saw
during Pitfs goal—line situation in the
second  Saturday.

Against Bowling Green, Derek
Kinder and Odeiick Turner lined up
on the right side, with 6-foot—5-inch

- freshman Jonathan Baldwin serving

as an option on the left side. Baldwin
acted as a mismatch against a shorter,
smaller defensive back. He took a
route to the left corner of the end
zone, attracting the attention of the
Falcons’ safety, which means only a
perfect pass could ﬁnd him.

But it also means good news: The
right side opens up.

As we saw, when the safety bites
onewayandtherunis stillathreat,
the opposite side of the ﬁeld or the
middle of the ﬁeld can become wide
OP“-

On the touchdown play, Kinder
made a few quick steps straight ahead
parallel to Turner. Tumerstopped on
adimeandturnedbacktowardstull,
while Kinder made a cut left toward
the back of the end zone The de-
fense, due to bad communication or
simply bad coverage, couldn’t stay
with the route and had no safety help.
Stull looked up and found Kinder

wide open in the back—middle of the
end zone — the same spot a safety usu-
ally controls

When operated oorrectly, as it was
by Pitt Saturday for the touchdown,
this play has options all over. If the
line holds up, it can be utilized even
more in the ﬁtture.

Nate  a tight end who’s
one of Pitt’s most useful weapons,
canalsobeafocusonplayslikethis
Hecanactasareceiverinthe slotor
line up on the offensive line to block.
He can catch and block with the best
of them and can make plays with his
feet; It might help Pitt to use Byham in
this situation, as he could create even
more of a mismatch for the defense.

And since Pitt runs the ball out
of this formation so frequently, the
defense won’t be sure exactly what’s
about to hit them. And as soon as it
starts loading the box and 
the run, Pitt can strike.

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt [left] and offensive coordinator Matt
Cavanaugh [right] have a good option in tight end Nate Byham.

Women bounce back,
beat up on Iowa State

Soccer, page 15

After falling to Dayton and struggling
in the heat of the weekend, Pitt’s offense
picked up the pace Sunday, knocking off
Iowa State, 4-1.

“We bounced back Sunday,” said Chin.
“It’s hard to bounce back on a Sunday af-
ter a Friday game, but we did. We were a
little concerned how fresh we would be,
playing in the heat of the day.”

The Panthers substituted in every play-
er on their roster to rest players from the
heat. -
“We used all of our subs,” said Chin.
“VY/e even had a girl get injured on Friday,
so we were down. Everybody contributed,
Molly [Griganivicius] scored our second
goal, and she came off the bench.”

Habbel scored two goals in the victory.
She gave the Panthers an early 1-0 advan-
tage after she ﬁnished off a shot from six
yards out in the third minute. Griganav—

icius scored her ﬁrst career goal in the
42nd minute to give Pitt a 2-0 lead go-
ing into halftime. Kelsi Morris and Caslin
were credited with the assists.

Pitt took a 3-0 lead on Habbel’s second
goal in the 59th minute after she ﬁnished
a shot from midﬁeld, assisted by sopho-
more Kat Weiler.

Carroll scored on a rebound shot in
the 70th minute to give the Panthers a 4-0
lead.

Pitt’s More Kephart earned the vic-
tory in goal and ﬁnished the day with ﬁve
saves. -

Coach Chin said the win will help in
building momentum for this Friday’s game
against Penn.

“W/e’re going to work on our pos-
session in tight spaces,” said Chin. “But
mainly we’re just going to build off our
performance this weekend. Nothing really
glaring stood out for us.”

Bash to continue even

Mustaches, page 5

The apex of the party in terms of num-
ber of people came from about 11 p.m. to
noon, when about half of the attendees
started making their way into the stadium.
Those who didn’t have tickets continued to
drink, eat and listen to music. There was a
TV, but it couldn’t pick up the channel the
game was on. ‘

At around 2 p.m., they gave out awards,
including one for best female mustache
and best Wann—stache, for the best overall
mustache.

The six winners were given tiny trophies
with a fake mustache placed on it. The tro-
phy for best Wann—stache was a witch with

if Wannstedtileaves Pitt

a fake mustache added on. The winner was
Joe Rok, a 2002 Pitt-Johnstown graduate,
whose thick mustache was a Wann—stache-
ian effort that would make Wooly Willy
jealous.

Elliot said he hopes to continue the
event even once Wannstedt has moved on.

“He’s not going to be here forever,”
said Elliot. “Hopefully he can turn things
around and win a bit more, and we’ll keep
his name as the title of the event. If not,
though, we’ll just make it the Mustache
Bash or something, unless they hire some-
one else with a mustache. Ideally, that
