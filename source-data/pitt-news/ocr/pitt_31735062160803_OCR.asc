Four Students Capture Tap Day Returns To Lawn

Honors In Story Writing

“Atlantic Monthly”
Places Selections

-Among First Five
Students at the University
have won four of the ﬁve top
awards in the Atlantic M onth-
ly short-story contest, accord-
ing to a telephone message

received by Edwin Peterson, :

professor of English.

First place in this contest, en-
tered by 150 colleges in the United
States went to Herbert Chester,
Col. ’58, a writing major. His
story “Wide Plain” won the $100

ﬁrst prize.

Peter Beagle, Col. ’59, won third
prize for his story entitled “My
Daughter's Name Is Sarah.”
Beagle is attending Pitt on, Scho-
lastic writing award -scholarship.

He has also placed ﬁrst in Seven- g

teen story contest.

Paul Zolbrod, Col. ’58, Uni-
versity Scholar and recipient of
a Fulbright grant, won fourth
place for his story, “Rotation.”
Zolbrod is the only one of the
four who is not a writing, but a
literature major.

The ﬁfth place went to Ray-
mond Sherp, Col. ’59, writing
major, for his story, “Amateurs.”
1, Peterson stated ‘that this is the
‘best record of any writing group
with the Atlantic Monthly. The
stories will appear in a special
Atlantic supplement to be sent to
colleges and their English depart-
ments in the nation.

All the winners are members
of Peterson’s ﬁction writing
class. The honorable .mention
awards have not yet been an-
nounced, but it is known that
the University is included
among the recipients.

For the last twelve years, Pitt
has placed either ﬁrst, second, or
third every year except two.

SGA Refers To

Third Party

For Constitution Interpretation

. By EDWIN ZINMAN
Student Government Association voted at Monday’s
meeting to refer Section 4, of Article 5 of the constitution for

interpretation to Dr. William

Boyer, Chairman of the Uni-

versity’s Student Affairs subcommitteeon Student Govern-

ment.

Dr. Boyer’s interpretation is intended to indicate an un-

Junior Receives Award

Rec.ipient of the 1958 Franch
Summer Travel and Study Award
is Esther Mishelevich, Col. ’59.

Announcement was made by
Mrs. B. B. Corson, chairman of

S the French Room Committee.

The awardee plans to attend the
University of Grenoble and to

 

Hostess

 

, taining

visitthe Bibliotheque Nationale in
Paris. She intends to study French
pronounciation and conversation.

She said, “I think that in this
modern world, having a second
language is most valuable to a
truly educated person. As a stu-
dent, I could gain a feeling of
belonging, of having some iden-
tiﬁcation with an institution
basic to France.”

Miss ’l\/Iishelevich has shown her
interest in the language by enter-
at French student who
studied at the University for a
short time, by attending lunch-
eons where the language is spok-
en, and by organizing a conversa-
tion group with other students.

Her activities include: co—ord-
inator of the Midday Series on
Student Union Board; representa-
tive to Intercollegiate Association
of Women Students from Asso-
ciated Women Students; Quo
Vadis, hostessing society; Sigma
Kappa Phi, honorary language
fraternity; and scholarship chair-
man of Alpha Epsilon Phi, social
sorority.

 

biased third party decision, but
not as the ﬁnal interpretation to
be rendered.

This action resulted from SGA’s
previous acceptance of the by-
laws committee report which rec-
ommended inclusion of four stand-
ing committee chairmen in the
executive committee.

The section in question states.
“The executive committee shall
consist of the ﬁve elected ofﬁ-
cers of SGA.” Permitting any
additional members to be in-
cluded in the executive com-
mittee constitutes a loose inter-
pretation.

Dr. Boyer has to date reserved
judgment of the particular ques-
tion until further study. In com-
menting on the constitution, Dr.
Boyer noted, “There are probably
many provisions which are capable
of more than one construction.”

In regard to the framers of the
constitution, Dr. Boyer stated,
“The philosophy of the evaluation
committee was to provide a ﬂexi-
ble constitution to meet changing
conditions, rather than a straight-
jacket one.” ' ‘-"

When the constitution was
presented to the now defunct
Student Congress earlier this
"year, several members objected
to the small number of repre-
sentatives who would make up
the executive committee.

They were told that the new
SGA could, if it so desired, in-
clude other members on the com-.

Plans for Tap Day have been changed after a meeting
of the Tap Day committee and Dr. Charles Peake, assistant

chancellor for student aﬁairs.

As a result of an appropriation from the University, the
program will be held on the Cathedral lawn rather than in

the Student Union Ballroom.

This grant enables the com-

Aspirations

Of NAACP

Dr. Charles Peake, assistant
chancellor for student affairs,
questioned the right of pres-
sure groups such as the
NAACP to berecognized by
the University.

Dr. David Henderson, professor
of sociology, stated that his sub-
committee of the Student Affairs
Committee recommended that in-
terim recognition be granted to the
NAACP.

However, the NAACP chapter
accepted a national charter with-
out authorization to do so.

A000l’dingl)', Dr. Henderson
sent letters to both NAACP na-
tional offices and the local chap-
ter. He stated that the chapter
had been granted only interim
recognition in his letters.

On the advice of Peake, Dr.
Henderson has informed the or-
ganization that new criteria for
recognition require more informa-
tion with respect to purposes and
relations with national head-
quarters. The status of the organi-
zation will be reviewed in the
light of the additional information.

¢mittee to use money allocated by

the Student Government Associa-
tion to set up displays.

The administration has also
granted a free hour for the pro-
gram“ which will be held from
12:30 to about 1:30 p.m. Wednes-
day, Apr. 30.

The program itself will ‘con-
sist of the announcement of
tappees to six honorary groups
and the presentation of special
awards. Other honorary groups
..on campus will participate in’
Tap Day by erecting displays on
the Cathedral lawn to recognize
their tappees.

“The program will be concise
and streamlined" announced Kyra
Mock, Col. ’59, Tap Day Chair-
man. There will be no procession-
als as there have been in previous
years. This will enable the groups
participating in the actual pro-
gram to have more time, Miss
Mock added.

In commenting on the admin-
istrations’ moves to aid Tap
Day she said, “With mounting
student interest in Tap Day the
administration feels that the
affair can become to activities
what Honors Convocation is to
scholarship.”

“The time off,” she continued,
“means that with an all—Univers-
ity dismissal, the increased scope
of the program can be realized."
Tap Day has been expanded
to include the Schools of Nursing
and Pharmacy in an effort to
make the event an all-University
affair.

Zolbrod Wins Fulbright

Paul Zolbrod, Col. ’58, has been awarded a United States
Educational Exchange Award, known as the Fulbright Schol-

arship.

Awarded under the International Educational Exchange
Program of the Department of State, it is one of 90 grants
for graduate study abroad provided for in the Fulbright Act.

Students who win the awards:

may study in one of 25 countries.

Zolbrod entered the University
in Feb., 1955 an English literature
major.

It was recently announced
that one of his short stories will
appear in the 1958 issue of Man-
uscripts and has just been an-
nounced that another short story.
has won the Atlantic Monthly
Short Story Award.

He is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, was recently honored as a
University Scholar at Honors
Convocation and he has an Owens
Fellowship.

He plans to do his study at the
University of Caen in France. The
subject of his research project
will be French Criticism of
Thomas Wolfe.

He credits Dr. S. Roy Heath
of the counselling service and
Dr. Jack Kolbert of the French
department with help in getting
the award. “Without them I
may well have never gotten it,”
he said.

“Heath gave me advice and
guidance while Kolbert intensi-
ﬁed my interest in French litera-

 

ture through classroom iwork and

contact out of class,” he added."

Zolbrod has spent two years in
the Army of which thirteen
months were in Japan. He was
editor of the PITT SUMMER
NEWS in the summer of 1957.

Kennedy Tells Foreign Policy Group

‘By MILLARD AMDUR

Senator John Kennedy be-
lieves that the crisis of the
times is being triggered by
American use of antiquated
programs to cope with new
threats.

“It is a crisis,” said Kennedy,
“involving every facet of life.”
The potential 1960 presidential
candidate spoke at the Foreign

Policy Association banquet.

Kennedy questions our “intel-

lectual and emotional” prepared--

ness as exemplified in the prison
camps of Korea. Collaboration
with the enemy and little resist-
ance to subtle pressures were
, typical. ,

' Many of our men refused to eat
“unfamiliar foods” and died as
captives. 38 percent of the captive
Americans died while for example
all the Turkish troops survived.

- Minds Must Expand

Kennedy admonishes that this
whole question demands “some
soul-s e a r c h i n g thought.” He
nevertheless admires the army’s
forthrightness in publishing the
ﬁgures.

We must educate minds as
well as build missiles, stated the
‘man from Massachusetts. Sev-
eral nations are nuclear powers;
nationalism of a “new shade” is
showing itself in the Arab fed-
eration. Africa is self-conscious.
. In 1953, specialists from Russia

entered the technical aid field and
this has been since then “the main
sword in the Russian onslaught.”

Aid Boosts Population
Russia has given 95 percent of

her aid to six vital nations on the’

easy credit plan. She has large
trade reserves and the economic

threat is far greater than the mili-
tary. I
Nations are showing growth
in population largely due to
American medical aid, said
Kennedy, yet these nations are
just the ones that can least af-
ford to support the new popu-
lation.

Mexico, served as an apt ex-
ample for the senator with the
death rate decreasing by 43 per-
cent and population increasing at
the same rate. The standard of
living of the nations is going
down.

Space Only the Beginning,

The national income. of the na-
tions is increasing while the more
pressing per capita income is de-
creasing. The Soviet Union can be
successful in the aid ﬁeld because
she has less bureaucracy.

able to send a larger number later.

of Pitt joining NSA.

NSA is a non-partisan organiza-

Non-Sectarian Nonsense

Chaplain Emory W- Luccock is doing two ﬁne jobs at
the University. This many—sided «man is a living example of

_-—~--—

_- multi-lateral organization. But nobody should ever havesto

follow in his footsteps. A

The two jobs that are needed are close in only one as-
pect: They both concern religion. Other than this they are
widely separated.

The ﬁrst job is that of providing a program to utilize
t.he ﬁne Chapel that this institution has been blessed with.
In this respect it seems thatthe position of University Chap-
lain was available to ﬁll the need created by this gift.

Planning an adequate program for all students of re-
ligious belief is an impossible job. Thejpresent program
serves as a common denomination for all ‘faiths but repre-
sents none. .

The recent program of the Student Council of Religious
Organizations is much more valuable.

In the SCRO program of bringing outstanding men in
each faith to campus in teams to represent before all groups
their religious convictions is much more positive and effec-
tive in providing for the fortiﬁcation of existing believers

 and the satisfaction of the curious.

A series of positive Chapel programs, unashamedly
SECTARIAN, would. be worth hundreds of the so-called
non-secretarian variety, regardless of the respect command-
ed by the speaker. "

The second job, commandeered so capably by the,Chap—
lain now, is that of administrator of religious activities.

Although a weekly chapel service is provided which
is_ purported by the University to be of a universal nature,

each major faith and sect is represented by its own program

and organizations.

This multiplicity of organization is strong evidence that
no common denominator exists that adequately satisﬁes the
needs or desires of religious students. ,

If these organizations could function as recognized
groups having University sanction the beneﬁts would in-

. ’. crease considerably.

To Organize this official backing of ‘many religious
groups an administrator" is needed. He must be a man train-
ed more in his directorship than in preaching and the con-

_ ducting of worship services. He must _be a man of scrupulous

equality and he must be willing to operate in the counsel of
a representative body of students.

I When the University stops trying to provide the im-
possible non-secretarian shadow of religion and provides
instead a strong, positive program for each faith it will be
breaking the sham boundaries of religious neutrality and
setting a new pattern for religious harmony.

(Editor’s Note: This‘ is the second of three
articles on The Unsilent Generation, a book writ-
ten by Princeton seniors. The first in the series
discussed “So Here I Am,” about a lad with
troubled childhood and jumbled ideas.)

=19 4: $

By Millard Aman-

“The Unsilent Generation” by Otto Butz is the
subject of discussion. After the “So Here I Am”
‘essay described in the last edition, “A GeI_1tleman’s
Son” merely adds wood to the ﬁre of the reader’s
discontent. *

This boy is perhaps what some people consider '

the prdtotype of ‘ the ~~"typical
Princetonian, country club, re-
stricted district, and “elite.”

These things in themselves
are of no consequence, but the
attitude of this boy is rather
shocking. He has been going
through the inevitable senior in-
terviews and his are highly re-
vealing. -

“I found that as I talked with

er and more conservate and pro-
vincial companies, I inevitably detected a feeling
on the part of the interviewer, of resentment and

sometimes even of animosity towards me.”

“When on the other hand, I. was being looked

over by the really large and dynamic enterprises,

the situation was exactly the opposite.” He could

feel the rapport and so forth. He concludes that]

American business, government, and education are
coming to consist of people like him, more and
more. I

This seems a rather sweeping assertion. All his"

friends are somewhere between the pages of Holi-
day and Sports Illustrated. He claims that he
doesn’t dislike people outside his set. He merely
doesn’t have anything to do with themfor “intimate
social contact would be pointless and probably bor-
ing on both sides.”

The one person he has come to hate is the man
with “a social inferiority complex, who is not sat-
isﬁed with ‘this middle-class status and who envies

us.” Later, “I cannot muster the enthusiasm to ‘v

give this type of individual the feeling that I give
a damn about him.”

Elite ls Dangerous

Pity the poor laboring maniand union negotia-
tors if they have to face up to this. It could pro-
duce a complicated situation that would result in
a strikevthe likes of which we’ve never seen. It’s
going to be hard to keep away from inferior mid-

Next Year's Bookstore . ::

 

dle class contacts and he may just have to give
a damn.

The gentleman believes that the Princetonian’s’

belief in the intellectual superority at Princeton
men is founded on realism, not snobbishness. If
he is any example of a Princeton Phi Beta Kappa,’
and he expects to be honored by this fraternity,‘
the realism is questionable.

Let’s hope that the liberal elite to_ which he .
belongs or claims to belong does not gain control .
or does not presently control the workings of this g

nation. If they ever do, all should move to Russia.
Another selection, “Survival of the Fittest” is

about a reformed juvenile delinquent who does,
not pretend..now that he is about to graduate from .

Princeton “to have any high ideal that guides me

or that could serve to disguise my desire to achieve‘

“something; and to be a success.
Boor Abhors Bores - _ .

"As far as my public life goes, my hopes for.
the future are based on the assumption that I am

going to have to take every short cut, every means

at my disposal to achieve my desired ends.”

Of his three closest buddies in high school, two
are now in prison and he’ll probably follow soon,
for embezzling or the like.

The senior who wrote “To Decide for Oneself”
has become tolerant and “less offensively outspok-
en” in his navy cruise of the “hulking denizens of
our proudest state universities” who are narrow
minded, humorless, unreasonably contemptuousof
Ivy Leaguers, incapable of deep thought, and above
all boring. .

To him the “ ‘country club’ tag sometimes ﬂung
at Princeton is no more than “the envious vicious-

ness of the socially self-conscious individual who '

resents the idea that you can be superbly educated
and have fun at the same time.”

He speaks 6f prejudice toward Jews but ration,-‘

alizes that this _is a result of the fact that these stu-
dents are usually “grinds’{ or “felt ill at ease among
prep-school socialites.”

He regards religion as an emotional device
through which man seeks to understand a handful
of basic questions about himself and his origin. , _

Although he’s tolerant of most religious beliefs

H or if not tolerant, indiﬁerent, his one exception is

the Roman Catholic Church which he regards “with
disgust.” It is ‘a religion based on fear “deliberately
generated by a worldly institution with the appar-

These Princetonians are certainly omniscient
for such young men. They have all the answers
now, but they may be sadly disillusioned later.

The Student Rate Isn't There

By Edwin Zinmovn

In keeping with the progressive reformation of
the University, the new book store will be a wel-
come addition in achieving that goal. It purports
to be on a grandiose ‘self-service basis ready for
operation in the fall semester.

Recently the 25 man Advisory Committee for a
new University Bookstore sub-
mitted a report on the proposed
facilities and services to Chan-

ﬁnal consideration. In view of i
the many meritous recommenda- :
tions proposed by the committee
there was, however, one over’-
sight. . .

No real issue concerning a 
student discount on new text
books was deliberated. A few
committee members, particular-
ly the only student representative John Barone,
voiced their individual opingion. Yet no actual com-
mittee consensus was forwarded in the report to
the Chancellor.

Consequently, in the Chancellor's review of the
report he preferred his policy stand by stating, “I

don’t see any reason for a special student discount.” T

His reasons were that, “All of the proﬁts go back
into a general university fund.”

With a little investigation ample reasons for a
student discount may be realized. First, should a
non-proﬁt coiiporation such as the university insti-
tute among its shareholders prolt-making services,

particularly when it involves as much as $400 for’

the four years? ,

Some might argue that since all proﬁts are re-
verted into .the university fund we all bene-
ﬁt eventually. Yet this beneﬁt is on an unequal
distribution since some proﬁts are utilized for
scholarships for a few while all contribute unwit-
tingly for the cause. Furthermore we all pay a $24
University fee per semester. In effect the bookstore
profits are an unnecessary hidden cost.

 

Other colleges have found it feasible to op-
erate self-sustaining bookstores with the discount
plan. Our neighbor Carnegie Tech, has always
transacted-new book sales. on a 10 per cent off list
price basis.

Yet they are not subsidized, but are self sup-
porting, no_t school supporting.

Still other schools operate on a participative
management basis. For example, Princeton Univer-
sity sells studentqshares in their book store. A stu-
dent board of directors plays an active part in its
management. ‘

Penn State employs a interesting method on the

merely places the book in a special section of the
book store‘ with the desired selling price marked
on a slip. «When the book is sold the seller re-
ceives his asked price minus a ten cent service
charge. ' g

Even greater proﬁts will be enjoyed in the
University’s new book store. Relatively high proﬁts
are assured through the sale of “convenience” items
as magazine, recordings, best sellers, cosmetics, and
the like.

u-mat... Buy from Tech

It is a well known that many Pitt students pres-
ently have friends buy their texts from them at
nearby Carnegie Tech in order to obtain a 10 per
cent savings. This not only undermines the entire
program of ﬁlling the University’s coffers, but
more important demonstrates student sentiment
on present procedures.

Further conﬁrmation of this was evidenced" last
year when Student Congress’ Public Relation Com-
mittee investigated bookstore conditions. Their
ﬁndings revealed the chief student objection was
the exorbitant prices charged on all books.

It may not be necessary to give trading stamps
and a‘ ten per cent discount on books, but a rea-

sonable plan of some type of discount should be M

consideijpd.

Kennedy Believes Crisis
Stems From Programs

nearly as many American teach-
ers of Russian language.

Kennedy claims that American
schools specialize too much and
deal with learning all the wives
of Henry VIII rather than getting
a broad base of religion, cul-
ture, and education.

Arms to be Avoided

“We've hardly begun to test our
mettle in assisting underdeveloped
=nations,” said Kennedy. Only
seven underdeveloped nations
have received »more than lé bil-
lion dollars. Much of this aid has
been military aid.

The United States has con-
tributed in economic aid one
dollar per person in India. Offer
of military arms offers no solu-
tion; assistance on this basis
should be avoided wherever
possible.

The proposal that the U. S. of-
fer $750 million in foreign aid,
primarily to underdeveloped na-
tions each year for the next three
years was cut down sizeably.

Congressman James Fulton of"

Pittsburgh, with Kennedy, op-
posed the cuts.
Tunisia Forced to Moscow

In new nations such. as Tunisia
where 40 per cent of the labor
force is unemployed, aid is really
necessary. They will be forced to
turn to Moscow or Cairofor aid
if the U. S. does not offer help.

France has been receiving
large amounts of aid. The war in
Algeria is sapping France eco-
nomically, and implicating the
United States more and more.
Our funds make the war pos-
sible. ’

The relations of the U. S. to
Tunisia and Morocco are there-
fore especially poor at this time
and should be improved. On the
-“other hand, in the recent French
election, anti-Americanism was
one of the strong points of the
winning side.

France’s ‘anti —- Americanism,
Kennedy believes, is completely
unjustified as the U. S. has gone
along with all her policies through
1955, ’56, and '57 in the UN, as
well as giving her substantial
grants in aid. _

Newly emerging India must
continue to be an important re-
cipient of U. S. aid.

vocated to keep India on the side
of the U. S. were to remedy the
dollar problem in India, to in-
crease interest in the second ﬁve

Latest records show that 40
different countries are now
represented by 192 persons at
the University.

These» persons are scattered
through almost every one of
the University schools, both as
students and teachers.

The greatest number of stu-

England is the largest source of
exchange professors and Japan,
the most research workers.

In the medical center, Canadi-

such diverse places as China and
Scotland.

Students outnumber other edu-

I have recently received several letters from readers which
have beenso interesting, so piquant, so je ne sais quoi, that I
feel I must share them with all of you. The letters and my
replies follow: a

SIR:

Maybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years
ago. On my very ﬁrst day, I got into a bridge game in the
student union. I am still in the same bridge game. I have never
gone to class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All I do
is play bridge.

To explain my long absence and keep the money coming
from home, I told a harmless little lie. I said I was in medical
school. This made Dad (my father) terribly proud. It also
enabled me to keep playing bridge. We were both very happy.

But all good things must come to an end. Mine ended when
I came home for Christmas vacation. I arrived to ﬁnd that
Sister (my sister) was in the hospital with an ingrown splcgn.
Dr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was
scheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by
a hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.

“Oh, never mind,” chuckled Dad (my father). “Harlow (me)
will fix Sister (my sister).”

Well sir, what could I do? If I told the truth I would make a
laughingstlock out of Dad (my father) who had been bragging
about me all over town. Also I would get yanked out of school
which would be a dirty shame just when I am beginning to
understand the weak club bid. I

There was nothing for it but to brazen it out. I got Sister
(my sister) apart all right, but I must confess myself completely
at a loss as to how to put her back together again. Can you

Sincerely,
Harlow Protein
Dear Harlow:
Indeed I do have the solution for you~—the
solution that has never failed me when things
close in: Light up a Marlboro! Knots untie as
you puff that ﬁne rich tobacco. Shade becomes
light as that grand ﬂavor comes freely and friend-
lily through that splendid ﬁlter. Who can stay
. glum when Marlboro gives you such a lot to like?
Not I. Not you. Not nobody.
SIR: ,
. Just oil‘ the campus where I go to school there is a lake
called Lake Widgiwagan. Thirty years ago when my father was
an undergraduate here he went fishing one day in Lake Widgi-
wagan and dropped his Deke pin in the water. He dived for
days but never found it.

Just yesterday-thirty years later, mark you!——I went ﬁsh-
ing in Widgiwagan. I caught a four-pound bass. I took the
ﬁsh home, cut itbpen, :md what do you think I (found inside?

You guessed it! Two tickets to the Dempsey-Firpo ﬁght.

Panther-Gator Tilt Washed Out-

Mitters S Play Tomorrow,

Doubleheader Saturday

By JIM LACEY ,
A busy week end is in store for the Panther Mittrnen as
they have three games in three days. Tomorrow they travel

t-o Allegheny to make up a

game called because of wet

grounds. Saturday the Blue and Gold journey to -Quantico,
Va., where they meet the Marines in a doubleheader.
This schedule will hurt Coach Bob Lewis’ pitching rota-

tion as he hoped to pitch Bill
Hamilton against both Allegheny
and Quantico. Now he will have
to go with John Reichenbach in
one contest Sat. while Dick Wirth
goes in the other one.
Wirth will be making his ﬁrst
start since the Syracuse game
in which he pitched a three-hit
7-0 shut-out over the Orange.
This performance was quite a
feat for the second start of
the sophomore season.

The. Marines will ﬁeld another
excellent team of former college
and professional players. The
game is an“exhibition for the Blue
and Gold and will not count for
Tournament play, win or lose.

Two of the performers are for-
mer collegians. Paul Mead will be
at the keystone position while
Bob Kuhne will do the catching.
Mead is formerly of Cornell while
Kuhne is from Syracuse.

Nick Kartsonas, junior out-
ﬁelder, has been hitting the ball
with regularity in the ﬁrst ﬁve
games, in fact Kartsonas has
had at least a hit a game.
Coach Lewis said recently
“Kartsonas is the surprise of
the season‘. I expected Jim Dun-

‘ lap and Ron Hoover to hit but

Kartsonas is a real Yind.

The Panther 4-1 record is far
better than last year’s 2-3 slate at
the same time in the schedule. The
victories came at the expense of
Inidana, California, Cornell, and
Syracuse, while the Orange in-
flicted the only loss. .

MANAGERS

Applications are now being
accepted for Varsity soccer
manager. Anyone interested

. should contact Coach Bemis at
the Field House. The manager
will be able to make all trips,
and assume business respon-
sibilities. He should be avail-
able between 4-6 p.m. next

Weather Halts Gridders;

Intra-Squad

Game Near

By LARRY HAGGERTY
Twelve more practice sessions await the Blue and Gold
gridders of Coach John Michelosen before the annual spring

squad game at the stadium on

May 10. “We have not been

able to hold our practices on a day-to-day basis because of

the poor weather conditions 1

ately,” stated Michelosen,

The 62-man squad has been concentrating on the basic

fundamentals and, learning new:
offensive patterns at the eight
practice ‘sessions that have been
held so far.

The large turnout of players
enables Michelosen to ﬁeld four
units at all times during scrim-
ages. The Panther coach drills
his charges for two hours a day
at Ellsworth Center when the
weather permits him to do so. .

“Without a doubt the keenest
competition on this squad at the
moment is at the end slot,” said
line coach, Jack Wiley. Letter-
men Art Gob, Jim Zanos, Joe Pul-
lekines, and Bob Rathi are re-
ceiving stiff competition from
Senior Paul Stolitza and Sopho-
mores Fritz Walker, Mike Ditka,
and Ron Delfine.

Walker, the transfer student
from Duke, suffered a shoulder
injury at the scrimmage last Sat-
urday and will miss several
drills. “His injury isn’t se_rious

though,” stated Trainer Howard’
Waite.

“Ditka and Fullback Jim Cun-
ningham have looked very good
at practice and in scrimages,”
voiced student manager,-John L.
Sullivan. Both men were mem-
bers of Steve Petro’s highly suc-
cessful Panther frosh of the 1957
season. .

Future plans for the Blue and
Gold gridders include more offen-
sive drills and also special work
on extra point conversions. Since
the conversion try is now worth
two points instead of one, this
part of the game has become more
important than ever.

“The football fans should see a
lot of different formations this
seasonbecause of the rule change.

mncerning the extra point,” ex-«.:

plained Michelosen. A recent na-
tionwide poll. of football experts
showed many various comments
on the‘ topic.

‘Uockey brand T-shirts"
made me irresistible!"

“I was a Saturday night bookworm, and not because I liked
books more than dates. To put it bluntly, I was resistible. Then
my best friend told me I needed to make a better appearance-—
I needed Jockey T-shirts. I "started wearing these good looking
T-shirts, and girls started to call me for dates!

“Now, thanks to Jockey T-shirts, I’m dated weeks in advance.
The twin stitch collar that ﬁts so smoothly, the trim-ﬁtting body
of the shirt, these are the main reasons why I'm so popular and

comfortable these days.”

Jockey T-shirts are
tailored extra long to stay
tucked in. Free, comfort-

able arm movement

guaranteed.
