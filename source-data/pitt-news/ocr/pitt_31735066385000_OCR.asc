United Way sets goal at $34 million

By Lisa Broujos
For The Pitt News

The needs of the community
are growing, and the United Way
is rising to meet them with a con-
tribution goal that exceeds last
year’s income by six percent, ac-
cording to Dr. Jack E. Freeman,
executive vice president of the
University of Pittsburgh.

”.We want everybody to give,”
said Freeman, this year's cam-
paign chairman for Pitt. ”Every
year, the United Way in Alleghe-

ny County sets a new goal. This
year it is $34 million,” an ”am-
bitious” goal that focuses main-
ly on faculty and staff donations.

Freeman said that an addition-
al incentive to earn money is the
challenge grant offered by the
R.K. Mellon Foundation, which
stipulates that for every two new
dollars earned above last year's
goal, the Mellon Foundation will
give $1, up to a total of
$150,000.

As you hand him your prescrip-
tion, you scan the countless
shelves of pills and syrups while
he studies it, grunts and quietly
disappears into a back room.

as Then you ask yourself, ”Is that all

there is to a pharmacist’s life?
Counting out pills according to a
doctor's prescription?”

”Not at all,” according to
James McAuley, second—year
doctoral student in Pitt's school
of pharmacy. "The profession is
shifting from one of dispensers

[of] medications only to one with
a more integral role in health care
provision, where the pharmacist
dispenses drugs as well as valua-
ble drug information.”

In fact, as the field expands,
pharmacists will be more visible
in large research companies, fed-
eral government offices such as
the FDA and corporations, where
they can couple their pharmaceu-
tical background with another
discipline, such as law. In the
clinical setting, ”typicaI pharma-
cists do carry beepers and do
rounds with doctors providing

nator who will organize the stu-
dent fundraising events to earn
money for the United Way.

He said, ”The Student Govern-
ment Board, in conjunction with
the Pitt Program Council, is go-
ing to be sponsoring a movie, and
all proceeds will be going to the
University of Pittsburgh United
Way fund. In addition to that, I
am currently writing a letter that
will be sent to all Pitt student em-
ployees along with a pledge card,
and it will be asking students to

drug information for monitoring
the patient.”

During his summer clinical ro-
tations at the Veterans Adminis-
tration Hospital in Oakland and
Western Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic, McAu|ey noted that
”pharmacists get a lot of respect
from doctors once they under-
stand that they’re there to provide
specialized information on the
drugs to be used in treating the
patient  and not just to fill
prescriptions.

Due to cuts in the federal budg-
et andthe growth in the popula-
tion, Freeman said the campaign
hopes to raise the additional six
percent to fund the 140 agencies
supported by the United Way.
Freeman said he is ”confident”
that they will reach their goal by
the proposed date of Oct. 28.
”We try to make it easy for peo-
ple to give,” Freeman said.

McAuley, who grew up in a small
town near Philadelphia (Morris-
ville), and who is the first in his
immediate family to graduate
from college, and therefore, study
pharmacy. ”But I have absolute-
ly no regrets.” When asked why
he chose to study at Pitt, he an-
swered similarly, ”There was just
something about Pitt and I want-

ed to get away from home. Once

I arrived, though, everything just

Police and
community
meet, talk

on drinking

By Rich Taylor
For The Pitt News

”Don’t place yourself in
jeopardy for a drink. It’s not
worth it,” said Pat Scanlon, Presi-
dent of the South Oakland
Citizens Association, last night at
at the convocation on the new
laws.

Scanlon along with officer
David McNutt and others spoke
to a group of students in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union Ballroom.

They explained the new laws
concern underage drinking and
charging admission at parties
where alcohol is being served.
The underage law gives stiffer
penalties to offenders. A first
offense will cause the violator to
have their driver's license sus-
pended for 90 days. In the event
that the offender does not have a
driver’s license, the suspension
will begin when they get one.

McNutt said that parties where
admission is charged falls under
the ’speak—easy’ law, a throw
back from the days of prohibition.
He said that this was not aimed
at reprimanding fraternities, ”As
far as the ‘speak-easy,’ that has
been on the books for years. That
was not geared towards the frater-
nities. When we’re dealing with
everybody’s rights, we don't look
at the Greeks’ rights, the students’
rights, we also look at everyone’s
rights,” McNutt said.’

He said, ’’I’m The Bad Guy.
We want you to respect the com-
munity.”

Pressure from the Oakland
community was one of the rea-
sons for the new laws. ”The com-
munity doesn't want to be the
bad guy,” said Scalon. ”Uust]
remember that there are other
people in the community other
than yourselves.”

Scanlon expressed concern as
well as anger about some of_the
less appealing results of social
functions. She referred to the lit-
ter, the noise and an incident in.-
volving fireworks shot off at early
hours in the morning. In addition
she noted pranks that prevail as
well. She said, ”Someone thinks
it's really funny to run up and
bang on your door.”

She added, ”We want to keep
you out of trouble. We're not
anti-student. When somebody
gripes maybe they have had
some very bad experiences.”

McNutt, community relations
officer for the Pittsburgh Police,
explained the police position on
the new laws stating, ”Kiss your
license good—bye. We got you.”

Police use‘ ‘sting’ operation, arrest 46 for car theft

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ Authori-
ties charged 46 people with auto
theft and receiving stolen
property Tuesday in a ”sting”
operation involving a suburban
Pittsburgh garage that was a front
for a police undercover investi-
gation.

Pittsburgh police Lt. Leo
O’Neill said the suspects were
charged with selling about 80 sto-
len cars and auto parts to under-
cover FBI agents, state police and
city police officers who set up
shop as WB Cars Inc. in Robin-
son Township near Greater Pitts-
burgh lnternational Airport.

The arrests, which began Tues-
day, came two years after FBI
agents approached city and state
police and suggested a joint task
force to crack down on rising
auto-theft rates in the Pittsburgh
area, investigators said.

The officers, posing as repair-
men who specialized in sprucing
up cars beginning in May 1987,
passed the word that they want-
ed to buy luxury cars, officers
said.

Police said every person who

approached garage workers
about stolen cars or parts was
either videotaped or logged on
telephone taps.

About $2 million in stolen cars
and auto parts were recovered
through the investigation,
authorities said.

Five more die as
hurricane continues

KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) —
Hurricane Gilbert, a killer storm
packing 140—mph winds, swept
past the Cayman Islands today af-
ter devastating Jamaica and the
Dominican Republic with fierce
rains, flash floods and mudslides,
weather and radio reports said.

Civil defense officials in the
Dominican ‘Republic yesterday
reported five people died, includ-
ing four children, when Gilbert
skirted its Caribbean shores
Sunday. ’

There were unconfirmed
reports stating that at least 30
other people died Monday when
Gilbert pounded Jamaica. The

NEWS BRIEFS .

confirmed death tall from the
storm was expected to be far
higher.

Bob Sheets, director of the Na-
tional Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla., today described Gil-
bert as ”a great hurricane,” say-
ing that, historically, ”|t’s
certainly in the top 10 percent as
far as intensity, size and destruc-
tive potential.”

In New York City, a ham radio
operator who was monitoring
amateur radio communications
in Jamaica today said, ”Kingston
is devastated, Montego Bay is hit
hard and Ocho Rios is flooded.”

Better statistics for
brain tumor surgery

PITTSBURGH (AP) —— Ad-
vances in cranial base surgery
have made 95 percent of all brain
tumors operable, compared to
about 50 percent a decade ago,
a medical authority said Tuesday.

The University of Pittsburgh is

hosting a five-day international
symposium on cranial base sur-
gery at a downtown hotel. About
300 researchers and clinicians
from 25 countries are attending.

The group is meeting to ex-
change information on advances
which not only have increased
the number of survivors of brain
tumors but also reduced some of
the long-standing risks involved
in surgery near the brain, such as
loss of facial muscle use or the
ability to swallow.

Authorities said the better
results come from the improved
ability to get at the tumors, know-
ing better which patients can
tolerate temporary closure of the
carotid artery during surgery, im-
proved tumor management and
the ability to reconstruct nerves
and bone structure.

Pittstudents learn security measures in Oakland

By Lou Grieco and
Emilio Mazza
For the Pitt News

The Office of Residence Life
and the Department of Public
Safety joined forces to educate
Pitt students on safety and secu-
rity in the Oakland area in a semi-
nar held at the Graduate School
of Public Health last night.

”We’re in the business of edu-
cation,” said Jerry Kowalski, as-
sitant director of the Office of
Residence Life, stressing the
responsibility of each student wi-

thin the community. According
to Kowalski, students seem to
have an ”immunity syndrome,”
taking their responsibilities for
security and safety for granted.
Special guest speaker for the
evening, Community Relations
Officer David E. McNutt of the
Pittsburgh Police Department,
said that there have been a num-
ber of complaints from the com-
munity about apartment parties.
”lf they don't start settling down,
we are going to start cracking
down.” McNutt stressed that Pitt
is a unique campus in that it is not

 

isolated but is also part of the lo-
cal community.

According to McNutt, much of
the crime and vandalism in Oak-
land are alcohol related. ”We are
here to maintain the peace. We
are going to be the bad guys."

Due to a rise in crime in the
Oakland area, the Pittsburgh and
Campus Police have been work-
ing together in what is called the
impact detail. This squad, which
operates Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights from 7 p.m. to 3
a.m., involves the pairing of one
Pittsburgh Police officer with one

Officer David McNutt informs the public about the new underage drinking laws.

 

Campus Police officer on various
corners of Oakland. The speakers
said that the impact detail has
been successful in lowering the
crime rate in Oakland. V
Sgt. Charles A. Grier, speaking
for the Department of Public
Safety of the University of Pitts-
burgh Campus Police, stressed
the new program called Opera-
tion ldentification. In this pro-
gram, students engrave their
Pennsylvania driver's/operator's
license number on their valuables
so that they can be identified if
stolen. Because Campus police

3

have direct access to the database
for driver's license numbers, they
prefer students using driver's
license numbers over other
means of identification. If a stu-
dent does not have a driver's
license, he should use the license
number of a relative.

‘Grier said that Pitt police ”have
full police powers” and are not
”security guards.” They are divid-
ed into 13 sectors on campus and
operate 365 days a year, seven
days a week. Crier said that Cam-
pus Police are a ”full service

When’ asked ifthe law was tar-
geted at the Greeks, officer
McNutt said ”We are not picking
on the Greeks. We are trying to
work with them in order that they
can live comfortably within the
community, as well as have the
community accept them.”

As well, Scanlon said of the
Greeks, ”Everytime a group of
students get together and cause
trouble they are labeled as frats.”

Representatives of the fraterni-
ties and sororities explained that
while the issue was not just the
Greeks, they would do what they
could to help the citizens.

Panhellic President Michelle
Jedlica said, ”l think it's so impor-
tant that we take responsibility for
what's going to happen here be-
cause we just can't sit back and
say this isn't going to happen to
our Greek system at Pitt.”

”l’m appealing to the Greek
women,” said Jedlica. ’’It’s got to
start somewhere. Why not us?”

Chuck Farinella, lnterfraternity
President agreed that this law
scopes the entire campus com-
munity, ”This is not just a frat is-
sue. This is a campus issue,” he
said.

”Look out for your sisters and
brothers,” Greek advisor Bridgett
Guernsey said. ”We’re in the
business of making leaders. We
feel a strong moral obligation in
educating leaders."

The trouble with parties in
Oakland has come to a boil and
the rules of the game have been
toughened to keep law and order.

”The ball is in your court,”
Scanlon said.

Reagan passes new

By MERRILL HARTSON

Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi-
dent Reagan signed legislation
Tuesday putting new enforce-
ment teeth in the open-housing
law Congress passed in the wake

'of Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1968

assassination.

Standing with members of
Congress in the White House
Rose Garden, Reagan hailed the
newly enacted bill as ”the most
important civil rights legislation
in 20 years.”

Singling out Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga., who had accompanied
King to Washington for the civil
rights leader's ’’I Have a Dream”
speech in 1963, the president
said the legislation ”has brought

, ‘ us one step closer to realizing

Martin Luther King's dream.”

The measure, which was
passed overwhelmingly by the
House and Senate, extends anti-
discrimination protections to the
handicapped and to families with
children. It also empowers the
federal government 3 for the first
time 3 to seek fines of up to
$100,000 against individuals or
organizations found to have en-
gaged in a pattern of housing dis-
crimination.

Under the open—housing provi-
sion of the Civil Rights Act of
1968, the government was given
only a mediating role in housing
discrimination disputes.

”Discrimination is particularly
tragic when it means a family is
refused housing near good

‘ schools, a good job or simply in

a better neighborhood to raise
children,” Reagan said. ”This bill
is the product of years of biparti-
san work, and repairs a significant
 defect in civil rights law.’’
He said that while the 1968
law was well-intentioned, ”it

department” with detective,
plainclothes and security
departments.

Grier suggested that students
take advantage of the campus
shuttle bus and cab service, use
the ”buddy system” when walk-
ing at night and never leave per-
sonal possessions unattended. He
also warned students of the haz-
ards of the bus lane on Fifth
Avenue, because each semester
at least one student gets hit by a
bus. Grier offers to hold work-
shops on safety for interested
students.

Kowalski offered several safety
tips for the resident students. Stu-
dents should lock their doors
regardless of whether or not they
are in their rooms, keep valuables
and keys out of plain sight, record
serial numbers of valuablesand
alert neighbors and Campus
Police of any suspicious persons
or activity.

”|t’s the shared responsibility of
all students,” Kowalski said about
following safety regulations in the
residence halls.

All of the speakers stressed call-
ing 911 in case of an emergency,
adding that you don't have to put
money in a pay phone to call this
number. Students can also use
the red phones, located in vari-
ous campus buildings, which are
directly connected to the Campus
Police Department.

 

civil rights legislation

lacked teeth. Its concilation pro-
visions were ineffective when
used.”

Reagan said that he and Hous-
ing Secretary Samuel Pierce had
”devoted eight years” to seeking
improvements in the 1968 law,
”to redress the absence of penal-
ties and the inability of the
government to initiate actions ex-
cept when ’a pattern of dsicrimi—
nation’ could be proven.”

Under the bill he signed Tues-
day, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development will
have authority to initiate enforce-
ment actions and to seek penal-
ties against individuals,
businesses or organizations that
discriminate on the basis of race,
color, sex or national origin in the
sale, rental or financing of

housing.

It authorizes civil penalties,
which could be recommended
following an agency administra-
tive enforcement process.

AP Political Writer

Michael Dukakis ques-
tioned on Tuesday how Ge-
orge Bush would be able to

hail Gorbachev ”if he couldn't
stand up to the ayatollah or say
‘no’ to Noriega.” The vice
president preached the gospel
of Republican prosperity and
said America is a ”rising na-
tion again.”

GOP vice presidential can-
didate Dan Quayle an-
nounced to a Milwaukee
audience that Dukakis had lost
his top naval adviser. ”His
rubber duck drowned in his
bathtub,” Quayle said in
another in a series of com-
ments designed to undercut
the Democratic candidate's
foreign policy and defense
credentials. ,

Bush campaigned as two
new national polls found him
pulling ahead of Dukakis by

deal with Soviet Leader Mik- ,

eight points. Bush led by 47
percent to 39 percent in a CBS
News—New York Times poll
and 49 percent to 41 percent
in a Gallup poll.

Gallup found results from
Bush's attacks on Dukakis for
vetoing a Massachusetts law
requiring teachers to lead stu-
dents in the Pledge of Allegi-
ance. The poll said 68 percent
of the registered voters it inter-
viewed had heard of the
Pledge of Allegiance issue,
and by a 2-1 margin they had
a less favorable view of
Dukakis because of it.

The Republican campaign
was buffeted with more con-
troversy when the co-
chairman of ”Bu|garians for
Bush” resigned after being
identified in a newspaper
report as the former head of a
Nazi—aligned group formed in
Bulgaria after World War II.
Radi Slavoff became the sixth
person to resign from Bush
ethnic organizations over alle-

Bush's foreign policy questioned

gations of anti-Semitic ac-
tivities.

Top Republican National
Committee official Frederic V.
Malek also resigned Sunday
after it was reported that he
had conducted a survey under
orders from then—President
Nixon of top Bureau of Labor
Statistics officials to see how
many of them were Jewish.

Bush expressed irritation at
what he called the lack of
”hard evidence on various
things.” Although he refused
to say whether he would hire
Malek in a Bush administra-
tion, the vice president ex-
pressed confidence in him.

Dukakis spokesman Leslie
Dach said Bush's policy on
questions of bigotry is to ”ig-

nore the shame” and blame‘

the opposition.

The new polls came on the
heels of two surveys providing
snapshots of a close presiden-
tial race with eight weeks re-
maining.

Citiparks helps Special Olympics McAuley

By Mike VanAuker

For The Pitt News

To ”promote social interaction
and physical recreation” among
mentally retarded and physically
disabled people, Citiparks is
holding a Special Olympics Pro-
gram for the fall, according to
Citiparks’ Public Relations Coor-
dinator MaryAnn Aliberti.

The fall program lasts for 10
weeks and involves soccer and
volleyball fundamentals.

Practices are held Monday
nights from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. at
the Glen Hazel Recreation
Center, in preparation for the
state Special Olympic Soccer

Tournament to be held at Slip-
pery Rock University on Oct. 16,
1988.

”Citiparks offers all sorts of pro-
grams,” Aliberti said, ranging
from parades, preschool pro-
grams, senior citizen programs
and many other special events
throughout the year.

Each season different activities
are offered as part of the Special
Olympics Program. The summer
program, for example, which
ended a few weeks ago, offered
softball competition.

Citiparks is interested in stu-
dents who would. like to volun-
teer. ”Vo|unteers are needed in
every area," according to

Aliberti.

’’It helps to be one—on—one
when working with them,” she
said.

Ideally, when working with
special groups and coaching
them in the fundamentals of the
sport, Citiparks would like to
have as many volunteers as par-
ticipants.

Although the fall program be-
gan on Monday, Sept. 12, anyone
can still register.

Anyone wishing to participate
or volunteer should call Sue Da-
vis at the Citiparks Therapeutic
Recreation Office at 422-6542,
during office hours.

Continued from page 1

with Dr. Pat Kroboth [chairman
of the school's pharmacy practice
department], who started me with
part-time research during my
fourth year. Since then, she has
been a very motivating force to
not only graduate pharmacy, but
to get a Ph.D. also.

‘'1 describe myself as a very cu-
rious person. I’m constantly ask-

_ ing ’why’ and then trying to find

out the answer.” This motivation
and drive have yielded other re-
wards for McAuley.

For example, an achievement
award is granted to the top three
of the nation's 72 chapters of Rho
Chi National Pharmaceutical
Honor Society based on submit-
ted reports of their yearly activi-
ties and special projects. Under
McAuley as president in
1986-87, Pitt's chapter ranked
first and won the award.

This year, McAuley was award-
ed the Rho Chi Graduate Scholar-
ship which is presented to two of
the nation's pharmacy students
who demonstrate scholastic
achievement and financial need.

The significance of this award, ac-
cording to McAuley, is that it

demonstrates that hard work is re- ‘

warded. ”Sometimes people
complain that they've worked so
hard and it hasn't or isn't going
to get them anywhere  this just
shows that you get returns on
your investments  and pharma-
cy is a lot of hard work.”

How has Pitt contributed to

McAuley’s preparation for the‘!

field? By providing academic and
social opportunities for him to de-
velop, Pitt has contributed to
McAuley’s preparation.

As a teaching fe|low,-he in-
structs fourth-year undergradu-
ates in the pharmacy practical
department. ”We [McAuley and
the department faculty] are
preparing students for pharmacy
as a career of drug and drug in-
formation dispension. As the field
expands, there [will] be more
pharmacists in the various areas
of health care, and you need peo-
ple to teach them.  That’s why
l’m leaning toward teaching in an
academic setting.”

United

Continued from page 1

He also stressed that only seven
percent of the total amount
earned will go to the administra-
tion. ”This is a record low,’' Free-
man said. ”We have more
volunteers than paid employees.”

"This year's campaign is look-
ing particularly good because of
the large number of people that
are involved at an early stage,”
said Bill Meyer, the new head of

the Allegheny County United
Way.

Meyer said that the United
Way is an instrumental organiza-

tion in funding programs that Q

handle community ”needs which
aren't apparent to the average
citizen,” such as adult literacy
programsand the Vintage pro-
gram at the YMCA, which pro-
vides care for elderly people and
victims of Alzheimer's disease.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 14, 1988

(Editor's note: This is the se-
cond story in an ongoing series
by Michele Quinn and her ex-
periences as a foreign exchange
student.)

At 6:25 a.m., I ran to the ele-
vator carrying a pile of scarves,
gloves and my overcoat. I wasn't
quite sure why I agreed to go on
this ”adventure,” as my friends
phrased it. Swimming outside in
Gorky Park during December just
seemed like a very cold idea to
me.

The elevator doors opened and
I saw the group of my friends
huddled in the dimly lit lobby. As
we made our way out into the
blustery morning, all I could think
of was swimming in something
like an ice cube tray, catching

.3 pneumonia and having to spend

the rest of my trip in a Soviet
hospital. _
The train trip was relatively
quiet. Most of the Soviets on the
train either read their newspapers
or stared out the windows at the
tunnel walls. I listened to my

friend Jim explain the setup of the
pool, hoping that his information
was correct.

In most travel books, the pool
in Gorky Park is referred to as the
”great Moscow swimming pool.”
Built in 1931, it allows 2,000
people to swim in open air dur-
ing both the summer and the

MICHELE
QUINN

winter. The swimmmers are pro-
tected from the cold air by a
dense layer of warm steam em-
mitted from the heated water.

As the train stopped and we
bustled out of the metro station
with many of the other swim-
mers, I kept thinking of the hot
steam and hoping Jim was not
lying.

Being the only girl, I ventured
into the changing rooms on my
own. The pool is surrounded by
little buildings which are num-
bered. The men and women are

Penn prohibits kegs

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Kegs of
beer are no longer allowed in
fraternity and sorority houses on
the University of Pennsylvania
campus, where a new policy also
prohibits consumption of alcohol
in visible, outdoor locations.

The policies, adopted by
university officials last week, are
aimed at complying with a new

_ state law that toughens sanctions
for drinking by individuals under
age 21.

Under the law, which took ef-
fect May 24, the university can be
held liable for furnishing alcohol
to minors if underage drinking
occurs on property owned or

0 controlled by the university, said

Kim Morrison, vice provost for
university life.

Morrison said a ”very signifi-
cant” number of the approxi-
mately 600 students who live in
Penn's fraternity and sorority
houses are under age 21.

”We are concerned about alco-
hol as a focal point of activity,”
she said.

Morrison said that fraternities
and sororities would be permit-
ted to serve wine and hard liqour
as long as it was limited to those
of drinking age.

The ban on beer kegs has long
been in effect at other campus
residence halls, according to
Morrison. She said the ban target-
ed kegs because kegs made beer
harder to control.

directed by the ticket-booth guide
toward which building they must
change in.

My biggest problem was, of
course, the language barrier. I first
had to check my coat in at the
front counter. There were little
old ladies everywhere dressed in
blue smocks either sitting around
or cleaning.

They all laughed as I shrugged
my shoulders, trying to let them
know that I needed help. One
woman showed me to the door
of the changing room.

I found a locker and proceed-
ed to get changed into my swim-
suit. The two girls across the aisle
stared at me, or I should say my
swimsuit. Most of the women
wore either very modestly
designed suits which reminded
me of my grandmother’s suits or
else bikinis from the ’60s.

After taking a shower next to
three old Russian women who
kept trying to offer me their
brown soap, I finally made my

 

way down to a steamy corridor.
The tiled floor was slippery, and
the only lighting was a strange
glow from the pool floodlights
outside.

Suddenly,’ a woman appeared
in front of me. I jumped back and
almost fell. She had climbed up
a ladder and out of the water at
the beginning of the pool which
was directly in front of me.

I climbed down. The water
wasn't hot likeJim had led me to
believe; instead it was luke-
warm. However, as I swam out-
side under the rubber flaps that
separated the small inside pool
from the outside pool, I realized
how much warmer it was com-
pared to the freezing air.

Heads bobbed into view, ap-
pearing out of the thick mist that
covered the entire pool. I
searched for my friends, hearing
them laughing and shouting in
English, and joined them in time
to hear John’s story about the lit-

tle old women who were also in
the men's changing rooms.

’’I put my Jams on and she start-
ed laughing at me,” he said, pad-
dling around as he tried to avoid
the other swimmers, who were
very somber as they swam by at
a slow, steady pace.

We splashed around for a few
minutes, laughing and doing
handstands under water. We
even attempted a short round of
chicken fights before the old man
who was swimming near us gave
a disapproving shout.

Finally,as we started making
our way back towards our chang-
ing rooms, we began to laugh as
Jim and John, who had not rent-
ed swimming caps, shaped their
hair into mohawks which froze in
the cold air — an interesting con-
trast to the flattened hair and shi-
ny bald heads of the Soviets
quietly swimming under the
bright flood lights in Gorky Park.

A heartening shift
in our expenditures

In a report published earlier this week, it was stated that
Americans now spend about $300 million more per year on
cultural events, defining culture as music, art and theater, than
on sports events. I

According to the report, the number of historical societies
has enjoyed a surge, attendance at drama festivals is up and
museums have seen huge increases in their clientele. Also in-
cluded in the report as ’’cultural’’ events were movies, which
could be evidence against the larger expenditure being a reflec-
tion of a greater interest in expanding our minds.

If movies are to be counted as cultural events,_ we have to
wonder about our culture. When increased popularity of Rambo

and Pee—Wee Herman (different manifestations of the same ill) g

can be considered a harbinger of enlightenment, perhaps we
would be better off at a studio wrestling match.

The report also said that book sales were going up as a result
of television adaptations of various novels. That is probably the
most heartening bit of news contained in the report. If a two-
hour TV show can foster interest in the wholly more reward-
ing pursuit of the written word, maybe there is some cause for

celebration.

In a nutshell...

”Why level downward to our dullest perceptions al-
ways, and praise that as common sense? The commonest
sense is that of men asleep, which they express by

snoring.”

A perfect day be

For me lately, things haven't
been going so well. I don't know
why and I don't know how, but
somewhere along the line, that
all—important reason to live has
been eluding me as of late.

But one thing has kept me
around, at least for the time be-
ing, and that is the fact that last
Friday, I had The Perfect Day.

Perhaps this wouldn't be your
idea of the perfect day, but then
again, I did say it was mine.

I got up and brushed my teeth
— a normal sequence of events;
in fact, I know you're asking why
and how could there be pleasure
in this, as well as how this sim-
ple act could be a prelude for the
perfect day.

Well, the water was amazing-
lycalm and cool, and the handy
”plaque—fighting" paste had an
uncanny good flavor. Brushing
was fun.

My morning shower was noth-

anything.

Still a little wet from the medi-
ocre shower, I rooted around to
find the ”duds-o'—the—day” —
your basic cut—off jeans, T-shirt
and button-down.

From here, my day took off.

I got in the car and drove
around for a few hours. Came
home. Did I6 push—ups. Drank
some ice water. Watched Oprah
Winfrey's show.

After this, I put on a blindfold
and ran my fingers over a velvet
oil painting of Fantasy Island's
Ricardo Montalban. Fed the fish
Twinkies. Poured rubbing alco-
hol into a nasty chest wound.
Read the Odyssey using a mirror
and a Lucky Charms

By then, it was almost 11 in the
morning. What to do? Well, like

Which one is brainwashed?

This summer, I spent six weeks
rooming with the son of an evan-
gelical preacher, although I’m not
sure if ”evange|ical preacher” is
the correct term to describe his
father. The father's name is Bob
Jones, and he runs Bob Jones
University, asmall private col-
lege in South Carolina which is
affiliated with the American Bap-
tist Church.

I had never met the son of an
evangelical preacher or even
known a born—again Christian.I
don't know how most people
perceive evangelicals, but my
perception was such that I was
not looking forward to rooming
with one for one night, not to
mention six weeks.

But I met Bobby Jones, and I
roomed with him for those six
weeks, and I learned a lot about
my own ignorance. By some
weird coincidence, Mr. Bobby
Jones was 5 feet 9 inches tall, he
had closely trimmed, light brown
hair and blue eyes, and he wore
glasses, a description which also

fits me.

He was the perfect roommate.
He was neat (I was not), he went
to bed at a reasonable hour (I did
not), he didn't play loud music at

gins with

SCOT
ROSS

a fight with Bob Newhart.
Pondering the ferocity of Bob's

left—hook and the toll it took on

my face, I had the chance to be-

.come a little introspective. I

thought about the state of man
and the earth we inhabit.

I wondered if dogs dream, and
if they do, do they have dreams
where they see a bowl of food,
but their paws don't seem to
move and they can't reach it?

all (I tried to do this either when
he wasn't around or was in
another room), and I didn't have
to worry about him stealing or
breaking anything (he didn't have
to worry about me either — I'm
not that bad).

But most of all, he was one of

the most sincere people I've ever
met. ’
Late one night, Bobby and I
talked about religion. It was the
most interesting and most frustrat-
ing discussion I have ever partic-
ipated in. It's one thing to have
someone yell at you because you
don't believe and so you're going
to hell, and it's something else
when you talk to someone who
is concerned about your fate and
honestly believes what they're
saying.

It was Bobby Jones’ belief
which most shook me. The evan-
gelists I've seen on TV usually
strike me as insincere and fake,
using their belief as a shield. Bob-
by didn’t. Belief like his is scary,

yet strangely beautiful, because
Bobby seemed, in a sense,
content.

I feel stupid in retrospect, be-
cause before meeting Bobby, my
image of him would have been
a Bib|e—quoting, brainwashed
robot who was intolerable of
non-believers and would love to
slap down a lot of laws restrict-
ing personal rights, and maybe
burning heretics. I mean, don't
those people keep their kids out
of public schools and fill their
heads with religous rhetoric?

I found out that if my mom,
who sent me the information on
this program, had known it was
run by a conservatively-inclined
group, which it was, she never
would have sent me the informa-
tion. And if I had known the
group was conservative before I
elected to go, I probably
wouldn't have gone.

Which one of us was brain-
washed?

catch up on McHale’s Navy re-

ysis of what it means to be in-
volved in a truck-and—tractor—pulI
competition.

Unhappy, but determined not
to let this setback ruin my perfect

Cooper
changing
tradition
at OS U

One man's loss is another
man's gain, or so they say.

But the cliche rings especially
true for John Cooper.

When Earle Bruce was fired
one game before Ohio State's
season ended in 1987, one of the
most prestigious jobs in the land
opened up — the Buckeye head
coaching position.

West Virginia's Don Nehlen
was considered one of the
primary prospects for the job in
the speculation that always sur-
rounds a major college coaching
change.

 

MATT  
MARTIN

But it was Cooper, then a third-
year head coach at Arizona State
University, who would become

the successor to the throne at one .

of the Big Ten’s top schools on
Dec. 31, 1987. .

Quite a New Year's gift.

The 51-year-old Cooper, the
first non-OSU alumnus to coach
the Buckeyes in 37 years, brought
impressive statistics from Tempe
to Columbus — an 82—40-2 over-
all record at Tulsa and ASU, a
10-1-1 record and Rose Bowl vic-
tory over Michigan in 1986 and
a near-unanimous choice as Na-
tional Coach of the Year, also in
'86.

But as much as his credentials
make him a natural for nearly any
major football program in the na-
tion, he is an oddity in the flat-
lands of Ohio.

Cooper is a native of Powell,
Tenn., who journeyed over most
of the West and Midwest regions
of the country before being
named head coach at Tulsa 11
years ago. In 1985, he was
named ASU’s coach, followed by
OSU this past year.

Not so strange. Most coaches
are journeymen before they can
actually settle down at a quality
institution. But the comparisons
between Ohio State's former
coaches, most notably Woody
Hayes and Earle Bruce, and
Cooper are nearly nonexistent.

Cooper seems at home speak-
ing to the media in his mid-
western drawl. His inaugural
game last week saw Cooper
shouting and waving his arms
wildly as he led his players out
of the locker room and onto the
playing field at Ohio Stadium for
the first time. Unheard of for the
traditionally stoic OSU coaches.

bers of the 1987 Ohio State

Sophomore quarterback Darnell Dickerson is the catalyst behind the Pitt offense this season.

Panther offense to turn over new
leaf with Dickerson at the helm

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Last season, the Pitt offense was
much maligned for its one—back
attack, and the defense was the
force that won games.

This season, the defense is
young, and there are a few play-
ers trying different positions
(former running back Louis Rid-
dick is at strong safety, Eric Sea-
man has moved from tight end to
defensive end and Prentiss
Wright goes from running back to
linebacker). It is the offense's turn
to take charge.

"I think we have worked hard,
and I think we're ready,” senior
flanker Billy Osborn said. "There
are still a few question marks on
the team, but until we are tested,
I think, there are always going to
be a few question marks.”

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried has
said the offense will be much
different this season. He indicat-
ed that a number of different run-
ning backs will be used, and
there will be more emphasis on
the pass and the option play will

be installed.

"I think our biggest problem is
still youth, on both sides of the
ball,” Gottfried said. "I think the
team has gained confidence in
our offense; we're going to need
to be a confident team to be suc-
cessful.

"But, of course, the only way
you get confidence is through
success. I think our offense can
do a lot of goodthings, but they
also make mistakes. So we'll just
take it as it comes.”

Last season, the Panther offense
amassed 2,374 yards on the
ground (1,791 by Craig Heyward)
and 1,718 yards through the air.
They scored 230 points, while
the defense held opponents to
146 points. .

These numbers are dwarfed by
those of other eastern offenses.
Syracuse gained 2,325 yards
rushing and 2,518 via the pass.
West Virginia got 3,236 on the
ground and 1,328 passing.
Boston College ran for 1,689
yards and passed for 2,327 yards.
Penn State gained 2,381 with the
run and 1,743 passing yards. The

Orangemen scored 363 points,
WVU put 330 points on the
board, BC scored 244 points and
PSU scored 286 points.

Each of these teams played a
schedule similar to Pitt's, the
difference being that the Panther

\ defense made up for the offense.

Things may now be changing.
Two weeks ago against Northern
Iowa, the offense scored 59
points (the highest output since
1982, when Pitt beat Louisville
63-14) and amassed 471 yards.

"The offense lined up the
wrong way a few times, and we
have been putting a lot of work
into that,” Gottfried said. "Even
so, I think weshowed some good
things, and we are on our way.”

The difference is the emer-
gence of sophomore quarterback
Darnell Dickerson. His combina-
tion of speed and a powerful arm
adds the dimension that the
offense lacked at the start of last
season.

”Darnell has come a , long
way,” tailback Adam Walker
said. "He’s more relaxed and

Women’s 3
tennis
team on
the rise

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
women's tennis squad opens a
season which they hope will
bring them Big East respectabili-
ty today in a home match against
archrival Penn State.

Pitt's '87 squad finished 10-6,
but last in the Big East by virtue
of their poor showing in the an-
nual conference tournament. Col-
legiate tennis is structured in such
a way that the Lady Panthers only
had to face their conference op-
ponents in the tourney, not the
regular season, and Pitt could not
turn their play up a notch when
they had to. 7

With several players returning
this year, though, Coach George
Dieffenbach and his team are op-
timistic that those stats will
change for the better, if not total-

ly reverse themselves.

”The team's looking better this
year," Dieffenbach said. ”Basi-
cally, I only have three goals for
this team. Number one, I want to
advance academically. Number
two, I want to improve tennis
overall at Pitt. And number three,
I -want us to get out of last place
in the Big East."

The Lady Panthers will be led
by Tracy Feltingoff and Lisa Kin-
ney, who will start at number one
and number two singles, respec-
tively, for the initial match. The
former will be inhabiting one of
the top two positions under
Dieffenbach for the second con-
secutive year, while the latter has
taken an extremely unconven-
tional route to gain her top-flight
status. '

Feltingoff gets the ignominious
distinction of facing the top play-
ers in the country several times a
year, but she has held her own,
posting a winning record last sea-
son. "It’s really a good ex-
perience," she said. "They
[opponents] are the best players
on each team. You're always go-
ing to be challenged."

The junior feels Pitt is physical-
ly capable of climbing out of the
Big East cellar, but the mental
portion of the game will be akey
this year. ''I think we have a real-
ly good team," Feltingoff stated.
"We have to be able to rally. We

need mental toughness, and we’

have to really be concentrating at
all times.”

Kinney, only a sophomore, did
not even play collegiate tennis
last year. She was the number
two singles player at her high
school, Hempfield, but she

decided to take in the college en- .

vironment her first year and then
try out for her college team after
that.

"l was a little bit worried about
going out," she said modestly. ”I
practiced a lot over the summer,
though. The competition here
was just fabulous. ‘

’'I was just hoping to play dou-
bles. I was shocked when I found
out I'd be playing second
singles." 3

Pitt can take solace in the fact that

they won't have to face too many
teams much more talented than
PSU. ’’That’ll be one of the tough-

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —
Los Angeles 1984 was a party
without the hard stuff. It was
lively but lacked kick.

The East Germans were in-
vited but declined. RSVPs
from the Soviet Union, Hun-
gary and Poland said, sorry,
we're not coming, either.
American swimmers had the
punch bowl to themselves.

They dove in and came up
with 20 of the 29 gold medals
at those Summer Olympics.
But the gleam was tarnished
by the Eastern—b|oc boycott
that locked out some of the
world's best swimmers.

Now those nations have
returned to crash this month’s
Seoul soiree. Welcome back,
the Americans say, and get
ready for a fight.

”When this meet’s over
with, there's no debate,” U.S.
swimming coach Richard

1 Quick said. ”We’re going to
add up the results and people
will know, and that's what ath-
letes and coaches thrive on.”

For decades, Americans,
particularly the men, have
dominated international swim-
ming. In the last three Olym-
pics that brought together the

U.S. swimmers set for
for challenge of East
bloc athletes in Seoul

Eastern bloc and the West -
1968,1972 and 1976 — U.S.
swimmers won 34 of the 63
individual events.

The East had a feast in
Moscow in 1980 and the West
was best in Los Angeles in
1984. Those results, though,
had a hollow ring because of
the missing competition.

’’I don't think, at the time,
the coaches or athletes looked
at it that way,” said Quick, an
assistant coach on the 1984
team. ”We kind ofdid months
in advance, but when you're
in the Olympic Games and the
excitement takes over and all
that kind of thing, then it's not
hollow.

”There’s a lo_t of great racing
going on and, because it was
in the United States, it was
very exciting. So it wasn't hol-
low. But it is misleading from
a statistical standpoint with
regard to the number of me-
dals that were won.”

There are 31 swimming
events in Seoul, 16 for the
men and 15 for the women.
Quick predicted his team will
win more gold medals and
more total medals than any
other nation. Another 20—win
season is unlikely. Fifteen is a
more realistic number.

Good season by Ascher vital to
Panther soccer team's success

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The will to succeed in spite of _

adversity is a quality that should
be admired. That quality can be
found in Jon Ascher, a senior on
the Pitt soccer team.

Last March, Ascher learned that
his father had passed away unex-
pectedly.

To try to overcome the tragedy,
Ascher set two main goals for
himself. The first was of a per-
sonal nature.

’’I decided to try to have the
best year I’d ever had,” Ascher
said. "1 had to get my mind
together. I couldn't give up."

The second goal was academ-
ic. Ascher will be taking the
LSATs on Oct. 1. ”l’ve spent a lot
of time this summer preparing for
that,” he said.

Being prepared is something
Ascher is used to. Ascher, from
Holland, Pa., plays the position
of stopper back. A stopper back
is responsible for defending the
other team's leading scorer.

”Basically, I try to shut him
down.”

”Jon is a key man on defense,”
Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher said.
”He’s our best man—to—man
marker.

”Jon’s a good athlete. He's
strong, quick and very con-
sistent.”

Ascher decided to enroll at Pitt
after spending his freshman year
at a small school near his home.

’’I had heard good things about
Pitt academically, and I wanted

to continue to play Division I soc-

bat.”

In his own mind, Ascher feels
that this year's team will be much
improved over last year's 10-5-1
squad.

”We have a good team and we
have positive attitudes. I think
that's important.”

Ascher believes that one im-
portantﬂaspect of soccer is the
coaching.

”Our coaches, Joe and Bobby,
have been doing a great job in
getting us prepared. They've
worked hard toihelp us get our
minds straight.

”lt’s important to get the right
coaching to players who want to
win. And that's us,” continued
Ascher. ‘

Ascher began playing soccer
when he was in third grade. At

that time, he was living in Port-
land, Ore., a place where soccer
is considered a major sport.

He takes his soccer just as seri-
ously here.

”There’s always room for im-
provement,” Ascher said. ’’I think
that we need to talk more as a
team. I'd also like to be able to
blend in more with the team and
be more supportive of the play-
ers around me.

’’I'd like to help the team win
as many games as we can. And
I'd like to prevent my man from
scoring.”

As far as this season goes, Asch-
er believes he knows just what
the team needs to do to make it
successful.

’’I think the key to this year is
to not make mental mistakes. We
have to take every game one
game at a time.”

Pitt men’s tennis team
not worried about this
weekend’s tournament

By Mike Seperack

For The Pitt News

The Pitt men's tennis team is
not intimidated by the idea of
competing in this weekend's Big
East Conference Championship
Tournament in Weekapang, R.l.

"I think we may be an upset
team,” said sophomoreleff Mills,
who will be battling junior Paul
Maben for the top spot on the
young squad.

The Panthers do not have any
seniors this year, and several
freshmen will be looked upon to
play key roles in the upcoming
tournament.

  

  
  
    

     

Coach George Dieffenbach’s
team is trying to rebound from a
disappointing season. Pitt had an
overall record of 10-10 last year
and finished seventh (out of eight
teams) in the Big East Tour-
nament.

In addition to Mills and Maben,
John Tegano and Vivek Kumar
will round out the top four seeds.

Freshmen Larry Garrard and
Joel Orth are seeded fifth and
seventh, respectively.

P Dieffenbach expects the team’s
previous tournament experience
(individual tournaments over the
summer) to make up for any dis-
advantages the squad may face
due to youth.

Perennial powerhouses Boston
College and Villanova are expect-
ed to make strong showings in
this weekend's tournament,
which is one of the major high-
lights of the fall men's tennis sea-
son. The other big tournament of
the fall is the ITCA Rolex Eastern
at Princeton, N.J., which is held
Nov. 10-13.

While the team is still prepar-
ing for this season, they are also
optimistic about the things to
come in 1989. Additional fund-
ing will allow the team to grant
several scholarships in order to
make them more competitive.

Also, because the team will not
be losing anyone to graduation,
Coach Dieffenbach is expecting
big improvements over the next

”We have a good future,”
Dieffenbach said. ”Everybody
will be back.”

 

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September l4, 1988

Cooper

Continued from page 9

coaching personnel on his staff,
probably satiating the ever-
traditional Ohio State fans.

He also appealed to his play-
ers, asking them which positions
they would like to play.

Obviously, offensive linemen
did not become wide receivers,
but players like senior Vince
Workman, Ohio State's 14th all-
time leading rusher, asked to be
moved to his natural position,
tailback, after spending the last
half of 1987 at flanker.

Cooper's confidence in his
players paid off.

Ohio State's season opener
against Syracuse, televised na-
tionally by ABC last Saturday,
shed some light on the ”new—
look" Buckeyes of 1988.

ABC commentator Dick Ver-
meil told his viewing audience

C that a team will usually get worse

under a first-year coach before it
gets better. Seemingly sound in-
formation. The coaches have to
get used to the players, the play-
ers to the coaches and possibly a
new system.

And that information sounds
even more solid when you con-
sider that OSU lost 11 starters
from last season's 6-4-1 team, in-
cluding first-round NFL draft
picks Chris Spielman and Eric
Kumerow, both outstanding col-

-legiate linebackers.

Cooper interpreted Vermeil’s
comment from a differentdirec-
tion '— from the coaching stand-
point, not the players’ or fans’.

”...When you first recruit a
young man out of high school, a
lot of times he's acclimated to a
different system than what you're
talking about. A lot of times, you
sort of have to break those old
habits and teach him to play like
you want him to play," Cooper
said. .

”We spend a lot of time at
Ohio State teaching our players
how to bend their knees. We
think if you can't bend your
knees, you can't play football.
Sometimes it takes a play. ir a year
or two to really adapt to what
you're talking about,” he added
in a serious tone.

But real changes have come
about under Cooper. ”This will
be the first time, I think, in 38
years or so at Ohio State that a
football team has dropped
straight back and attempted to
throw the football,” he said.

Changes can work for or
against you. But everything fell
into place for Cooper and his
Buckeyes last week. Against the
Orangemen, an 11-0-1 team last
season, Ohio State showed offen-
sive balance and defensive poise
in a 26-9 blowout.

Even more impressive was the
fact that, despite the position
changes and new starting faces,
OSU did not turn the ball over
even once and had only one
penalty, that coming late in the
fourth quarter.

”We were tremendously im-
pressed with our victory over
Syracuse,” Cooper said. ”The fact
that we didn't turn the ball over
— no interceptions, no fumbles,
and no major penalties in the
ballgame — is really amazing for
that first game."

Cooper was obviously pleased
with the first game of his era at
Ohio State. But, unlike many
coaches, he is quick to point out
the flaws in his team.

0 ”[Sophomore tailback] Carlos
Snow's a good runner, but there's
some other things he doesn't do
so well,'' Cooper said. ”He's not
a real good blocker, and right
now, hedoesn't have a great un-
derstanding of what we're trying
to do in our passing game in
terms of getting our backs to
come out of the backfield.”

0 ”We’re a young defensive
football team, particularly in the
secondary and at linebacking."

Only two examples, but again,
unheard of in most coaching cir-
cles, particularly Ohio State.

Tradition has taken a turn at
Ohio State —- for the better or the
worse will have to be decided
later. But for now, football is not
a chore anymore. Cooper may
have expectations to live up to in
his first year, but he must be more
concerned about the expecta-
tions he has set for the team
rather than those set by the peo-
ple around him.

  

Coach John Cooper Ohio State headed in the right direction.

nent this week, said, ”He looks

son. I knew right then he would
be a good one."

The offense will be able to

Osborn said. ”We are capable [of
putting] some points on the
board, but we can't put one side
of the offense on the backburn-
er. We have to do everything to
win.”
