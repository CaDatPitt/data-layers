 

   

Forrest Evashevski, former
Michigan all-American, was

added to the University of’

Pittsburgh coaching staff, it
was announced late Saturday
afternoon, after Dr. Arnold
Greene and Harold Stebbins
resigned their backﬁeld coach-
ing positions.

Evashevski was head coach of
Hamilton college at Clinton, New
York, last fall and guided his team
to a record of ﬁve wins and two de-
feats against top-notch opposition.

He was famous as a great block-
ing back and was captain of the
1940 Michigan eleven. Teamed with
Tommy Harmon they were the most
feared gridiron duet in the coun-
try. '

In his senior year, Evashevslci
won the Western Conference med-
al given annually for scholastic
achievement. The new Pitt assist-
ant is married to Governor Stas-
sen’s' daughter, and is the father
of a baby boy.

Arnold Greene, quarterback and
fullback from 1934 through 1936
and backﬁeld coach since 1939, is
retiring from football to devote full
time to setting up his dental prac-
tice in Harrisburg. Stebbins, right
halfback on the famed “dream
backﬁeld” and a member of the
coaching staff since 1940, is spend-
ing his full time as an executive of
the dairy company with which he
has been associated for the past
two years.

Evashevski is expected to be in
Pittsburgh a week or so in advance
of the start of spring drills, this
start being tentatively set for
March 16.

The ‘resignation of Stebbins and
Greene and the addition. of Eva-
shevski brings the Panther coach-
ing staﬁ’ down to six members.
Head coach Charles Bowser, John-
ny Dickinson, Bobby Hoel, Doc
Hartwig, and Nick Kliskey coin-
prise the staff. .

Eighth Flo... Tuclcshop

Moves to Ground Location

There will be no line of men Stu-
dents outside 827 Cathedral today
during the ﬁfth hour.

The men's tuck shop has been
moved to the -old tuck shop on the
ground ﬂoor.

Both men and women students
who carry their lunches now will
eat in the ground floor lunch room,
alleviating the crowded elevators
which carried men to the eighth
floor lunch room.

In 827 Cathedral a new men’s
lounge will open this week. Al-
though no food will be served, mag-
azines and games of chess and
checkers will be available.

The dean of men’s office said that
the date of opening of the lounge
is indeﬁnite because of proposed
changes in furniture and arrange-
ment.

Discussed for several years, the
final decision for the moving of
the eighth ﬂoor tuck shop came
after the dean of men's office, Stu-
dent-Faculty association, Men’:
council, and the building and
grounds department studied the
program and decided upon the
necessary changes.

Students found in the eighth
ﬂoor tuck shop Friday. the last day
it was open, made various com-
ments.

“The change won“: inﬂuence my
daily relaxation hours at all. I'll eat
downstairs and later go to the
lounge if I want to play checkers
or chess,” said Irvin Friedlancl.
C44.

Sam Manda, C44, likes the idea
of the change, but he says, “I

. ,_w what to do with the
G - . I'll save.“

  ,.‘.=%: i  .

  

C*.'I it

the change should have been made
years ago———at least three years
ago.

Michael Gilberti, C43, ‘said, “I’ll
eat on the ﬁrst and then relax on
the eighth.”

Ray Williams, Ed43, does not
care what changes are made so
long as he can play bridge, and
chess, and Leo Weinberg, E43, said
that the change would aid his di-
gestion. “Now a good bridge hand
won't interrupt my eating."

diAquatic Team Trounces

’ C)berlin For Filth Victory

Kenyon College team by the iden-
tical score that the Pittman did last
week. But the invaders didn’t have
the power to cope with Grady’s
top-notch squacl, and consequently
saw their hopes of an unbeaten
season crushed.

Gus Wilde came through in his
usual meritorious style when he
swam‘ a. dead heat with teammate
Joe Orloﬂt‘ injzhe 50-yard free style
race, placed first in the 100-yard
free style, and formed an import-
ant part of the ‘winning >400-yarcl
free style relay team.

Jack Richards, captain of the op-
ponents, kept his team in the scor-
ing when he easily outdistanced
the ﬁeld in 220-yard free style race
and the 440-yard _n~ee, style race.’

Pitt’s Joe Kaule went through a
mixture of straight and fancy dives
at the PAA pool to average 11.5"
points per dive, beating the Ober-
lin divers rather decisively.

The last event: of the evening
was the mile relay race in which
Pitt's quartet of Orloff, G. Wilde,
Kramer, and Cosgrove beat the
Oberlin foe by many lengths to ﬁn-
ish in the honorable time of 4:002.
Pitt’s mile relay team is reputed to
be one of the finest aggregations
in the east, andiwill be out shoot-
ing for top honors when the East-
ern Collegiate Swimming Associa-
tion meet comes around nextiwee-ls.

All the times‘ were rather slow
in con1parison.with the marks that
the local aquatic team has been
shattering of’ late.

rang up a first half lead, and

The Pitt Panther b'asl<'et'-
team closed its poorest cam-
paign since 1924 last S-atu1"day
afternoon at West Point when
an underdog Army quintet

coasted in to cop a  Vic-

tory.

It was the Panthers’ 10th
defeat in 15 games, represent-
ing the worst record for a local
quintet since the 1924 season which
resulted in three wins and nine dc“-A
feats. The Cadets’ victory was
their ﬁfth straight win, and are
looking wforward to their season
ﬁnale against Navy this week.

Pitt’s poor sliowvingwas just an-
other case of looscyball handling
and inaccurate shooting,‘ and mark-
ed the end of collegiate competi-
tion for scniorsﬂim Egan, Ed Ziol-
kowski, and Iiarry Palfrath.

Army piled up a 24-9 score at
the end of the first half, -largely‘
through the sterling efforts of Cap-
tain White and .lammie'Philpott.
The Panthers were merely going
through the ‘motions in the initial
stanza for they netted only two
ﬁeld goals, both of them by Tay
Malarlcey.

The Soldiers, led by Philpott,
who annexed high.-scoring, honors
with 16 points, were slowed down
in the second half. But their 13
point margin at half time proved
enough to insure an easy victory.

At the start of the second half
Paul Lohmeyer, “Lefty” Zioll<ow-
ski, and Bobby.Artman‘ bcfgan to
drop points through, the hoop, and
thelllue and "Gold eager-s found
themselves within seven» -points of
the faltering Cadets. But it was ﬁve
minutes before the Pittmen could
score again, and Rebh, Benson,
and Philpott countered with field
goals to put» the game on ice.

Cage Selections; Hamilton Named Captain

An often quoted sports axiom is‘.
“)1: takes snore than one man to
make a team.i”,_‘A hasty glance" at
the Pitt Nexvislazll-_oppo11ent basket-
ball squad gives further‘ proof to
this fact. West Virginia, who plac-
ed‘ three players on the first team,
was also voted the outstanding out-
ﬁtthe Panthers faced all season.

A Picked by the me and Gold
traveling squad and coach H. Clif-
ford Carlson, the mythical all-star

aggregation gives a. first team_

place to Geneva and Westmin,ster
besides tlie three spots captured by
the Mountaineers’.

Polling 11 out of a possible 12
votes, Floyd “Scotty” Hamilton,
West Virginia’s clever ball han-
dler, was named captain of the
team, as he led all other players in
the voting. Hamilton, who ﬁr-st-

[on the second team‘ of the all-opf-

hoop and laying it up provided most
ofphis tallies.

One of the bigger disappoint-
ments sutfered by the Panthers
during the past year was the heat-
ing administered‘ to them by Gen-
eva’s Covenanters. The man main-
ly responsible for the upset scored
by the Covies was Charles De-
Venzio, stellar guard of the team.

In the first meotingiof the two
teams, “Chuclc" indicated that he
would be heard from again when

Michigan Squad Crushes  

Panther lndoor Trackmen 

Michigan, favorites in the Big
Ten indoor, track race, captured
nine out of 12 first places last l*‘ri-V
day evening to administer one» of
the worst defeats in the history of

Pitt cinder competition by the
score of 77-2‘/3 to 26-1/3.
Bill Carter, Pitt’s champion

sprinter, took down top honors of
the afternoon when he equaled the
meet record of 6.3 in winning the
60-yard dash, and took ﬁrst place
in the broad jump with a leap of
23 feet.1-34 inches. It was a great
day for the flashy Negro for he
beat the Big Ten champion, Thom-
'as, in the 60-yard dash, tieing
teammate “Hap” Sticl<el’s _marl(.

Had Stickel been able to com-'

pete in the dual meet against the
Wolvel-incs,—the score might have
been closer ‘for, the Olsonmen lost
valuable points in the mile 1"ela,v
event, (55-‘_yai-d low hurdles, and a
possible second in the 60-yard dash.

2. Michigan’s Bob Ufer, a junior
.f.'rom Pittsbuigh, equaled Johnny
Woo(li.'11fi"t’s ﬁve—year—o1d meet and
field house 1‘e.cord in the q_uarter
mileas he cove:-ed the 440 yards
1'n.49.1.

Michigan's tracksters had a rel-
atively easy time trouncing the lo-
cal brigade, but, unfortunately,
their victory might later cause
them to lose their Big Ten crown.
The Wolverines’ high point man,
Frank McCarthy sustained a pain-
ful hip injury in the low hurdle
race and may be forced out of the
'Western Conference championships
next week.

McCarthy ﬁnished third in the
low hurdle race and crashed into
the pole vaulting pit as he complet-
ed the race. Previous to l'l1iS,_MaI-
Carthy captured a ﬁrst place in the
high jump. ‘
