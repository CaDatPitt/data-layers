Talking WikiLeaks could jeopardize jobs

Gretchen Andersen
Staff Writer

A number of Pitt professors and administrators
warned students last week against sharing con-
troversial information released by W1l<iLeal<s— '
especially ifthey have aspirations to workforthe
government

W1kiLeaks, an organization that publishes
conﬁdential documents on its website, released
aquaitermillion secret cables discussingAmeri—
can diplomacy in late November. Many of the
documents are considered classiﬁed informa-
tion, and possessing them could violate federal
criminal statutes.

Sharing the W1kiLeaks, some have argued,
amounts to sharingclassiﬁed information, anact
that could gum up the works during the regular
security and background checks conducted on

people applying for gbvemment jobs.

I Jessica Hatherill, associate director ofAlurrmi
Relations and Career Services for the Graduate
School of Public and International Affairs, said
in an e—mail that the school is taking precautions
and warning students about the implications
of sharing WikiLeaks or their opinions on the
controversial release of documents.

GSPIA decided how towarnstudents onDec.
8 after “speakingwith career services colleagues
from other schools of international affairs and
public policy and reviewingarticles written about
the situation,” Hatherill said.

worried, Hatherill said.

“Our message is to be smart about the situ-
ation,” Hatherill said. “Don’t do something that
could endanger your ability to obtain a security
clearance inthe future.” I

Donald Rieley, director of Career Services at
the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, said
he sent a Washington Post article in an e—mail to

  e that students rea_ 1ze the

them to have information from reputable sourc-
es,” she said. .

Hatherill said she and her colleagues have l

not heard worries from students, but said they
are perhaps talkingto their professors about the
issue. GSPIA students are encouraged to talk to
Career Services if they have anyquestions or are

his students, colleagues and some ﬁiends.
Rieley urged students to be aware of the
consequences of discussing WikiLeal<s on Fa-
cebook or Twitter. He said though many consider
W1kiLeal<s public information, the government
still considers it illegal activity. _
“This could potentially be a stumbling block

for security clearances if they identify themselves
as sharing WikiLeaks,” Rieley said. “Students
should be forewarned.”

The Office of Career Services has a history
of encouraging students to be careﬁil with what
they post on social media sites.

“It’s afact: Recruiters do go on Facebook, or
they?ll assign it to an intern to check on a candi-
date,” said Barbarajuliussen, associate director
of Oﬁice of Career Services.

Juliussen said that as a staff, Career Services
has not decided what to do about WikiLeal<s,
but she is “sure the topic will come up in the fu-
ture.”

Juliussen said students applying for govern-
ment jobs havebeen told by Careerservices that
it is a lengthy process and there is a thorough
background check. I ,

Many students have conflicting or mixed
feelings about discussing WikiLeal<s on social
sites.

James Price, a second year Masters student in
International Development, said that he hasn’t
posted anything about W1kiLeaks but under-
stands both sides. .

“I think it’s understandable that the govem—
ment would have their position. Many of the
documents are considered secret,” he said. “I
understand their perspective in that they have

Senior Staﬁ Writer

There’s no physical barrierthat sepa-
rates the student groups involved with
the Israeli—Palestinian debate on campus,
but this semester proved that there is
clearly a divide.

Panthers for Israel, the Pittsburgh
Israel Public Affairs Committee and Stu-
dents forjustice in Palestine held a num-
ber of rallies and events across campus
over the past few months. The groups
also brought in speakers and participated
in a three-day Middle East peace confer-
ence hosted by One Life One World One
Peace — another Pitt activist group.

And although tensions at times ran
high this semester, both camps are op-
timistic about continuing the discussion
next semester.

“I’m happy that we’re having this dis-
cussion on campus, and the dialogue is
beginning to emerge,” Pittsburgh Israel
Public Affairs Committee president Sa-
mantha Vinokor said. “I’m really looking
forward for this to continue.”

Next semester, Panthers for Israel and
PIPAC have plans to bring in speakers like

Middle East tensionscontinue in Oakland

Pro—Israeli and Pra—Palest1'.m'an groups on campus have sparred — verbally — throughout the semester

Sgt. Benjamin Anthony, who will discuss
hisexperience with the Israel Defense
Forces, as a part of a lectur_e circuit or-
ganized through Our Soldiers Speak, a
group that addressed media perceptions
of the Israeli Defense Force.

The two groups plan to hold Israeli
educational events before the country’s
Independence Day at the beginning of
May. '

SJP doesn’t have any plans set in stone
yet because it plans events around orga-
nizations and events that tour. Officers
said they would like to bring back “DAM,”
or Da Arabian MCs — a Palestinian hip-

hop group that performed last year at

Carnegie Mellon. V

SJP president Sarah Moawad, Panthers
for Israel President Sam Mellits and Vi-
nokor all said that they would be open to
having a formal discussion in the future
as long as an appropriate external third
party could moderate and a format was
created that everyone would be comfort-

. able with-

Forbes Avenue has been a location of
tension and high emotions. SJP organized
a mock checkpoint —— to resemble those
manned by the Israeli army in the West
Bank —— as well as a “die-in” and rally

this semester, all of which Panthers for
Israel and PIPAC attended to pass out
their own literature.

Moawad said that Students for Jus-
tice in Palestine does not have a political
agenda and is not trying to change the
minds of people nor provoke anyone.
She said the group uses many different
methods to engage with people on some
level. A

Some in the pro—Israeli groups had
similar sentiments. Vinokor said, “I be-
lieve that before a campus can become
politicized, it has to be educated.”

Panthers for Israel and PIPAC paired
up to bring in speakers as well. Noam
Bedein, the director of the Sderot Me-

fdia Center‘, talked about the portrayal

of Israel in the media and current issues
in Israel. Bret Stephens,-a foreign affairs
columnist for th'e'Wall Street Journal,
discussed the threat of a nuclear-armed
Iran to Israel, the U.S. and theentire

1 Western world.

Mellits said he tries to provide some
context when he’s passing information
along to people.S_]P also hosted “I Heart
Hamas,” a one—woman play by Palestinian
Jenniferjaj eh, and Israeli writer and film-
makerjoseph Dana, an active participant

with Anarchists Against the Wall, gave a
lecture about the barrier being built by
Israel along the West Bank.

“Everyone is always going to have
their opinions because there is such a
wide spectrum of opinions on this issue
specifically,” Moawad said. “I think no
matter what you do or what you say or
how you go about it, there are always
going to be people who disagree with
you. The nature of this issue is not just
one-sided. It’s many—sided.”

As the Israeli and Palestinian debate
continues, the groups have taken a more
expansive approach than in past years.

Panthers for Israel split at the end of
the last semester to create PIPAC. Pan-
thers for Israel organizes cultural events
while PIPAC handles the advocacy and
the activism aspects. .

SJP was created earlier in the last
decade, but the organization simmered
down as the students who created it
graduated. Moawad decided in 2008 to
reignite the group again in order to bring
another viewpoint back to campus.

,“I think in college it’s important to
talk about controversial issues,” Moawad
said. “We have to, because it’s a real-

to boost your GPA,” Mullen said, though
there are limits to the number and types of
courses students can repeat. The various
schools determine how repeating particular

-courses works;

Mullen advised students to ﬁrst take
‘some minor steps before choosing to re-
peat a class. '

“Students should speak with an instruc-
tor and adviser, discussing their experiences
in the course, and decide where to go from
there, whether it is a course repeat or change
in direction,” Mullen said.

CHERYL PAUL:

grade will be recalculated into the GPA
though the original grade will remain on
the transcript. ’ 4

/ Paul said engineering students often
repeat a‘ class in the summer because the
workload is lighter.

Like Mullen, Paul said students should
immediately pick up a Course Repeat form
from their adviserbecause “your new grade
will be recalculated sooner and you will not
forget.” A

Paul said repeating a class is a “smart
thing to do.”

 

In the event that he retakes a course, Arts
& Sciences will recalculate the “new” grade
into a student’s GPA, even if that grade is
lower than the original. The original grade
therefore will not be calculated into the GPA,
but will remain on the transcript.

This process only works, however, if

. the student hands ina Course Repeat form,
‘ which Mullen advises students to do “as

soon as possible.” Course Repeat forms for
Arts & Sciences students can be found in 140
Thackeray Hall. . ‘

Mullen said he hasn’t seen any evidence
that students tend to do better in a class
the second time around, but he also added
that the‘ outcome depends a lotvupon the
individual student.

For engineering students, the process
is similar, said Cheryl Paul, the director of

Engineering Student Services. Engineering ,
students can repeat a class, and the new

“Generally speaking, yes, there are those
who retake because they aren’t very invested
and might not do as well, but for students
who are motivated, I’ve seen them keep
scholarships, some who go from a low 2 to
a high 3,” Paul said. “Sometimes students
may just have a bad semester.”

“Students should reach out to their ad-
viser and discuss options in depth,” Paul

_i said. “They shouldn’t feel that they are doing

this by themselves, there area lot of people
in engineering who want to help them.”

Business students who fail a course also.

have a similar option. Elizabeth Adams, di-
rector of the College of Business Administra-
tion’s Advising Center, said in an e—mail that
“if the course was an elective, the student
could opt to let the F grade stand and just

An outdoor feast

Students flock to T—Rav’s on Atwood Street each weekend

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staff Writer

The menu at T-Rav’s BBQ Lab is a small
paper stuck between two fence poles. There
are three dishes to choose from: hamburger,
hot dog and pulled pork.
“It don’t get no betta,” reads the menu.
Situated behind the fence is a large grill
lined with sizzling hamburger patties and

' columns of charred hot dogs. The grill used

to sit on a patch of healthy, green grass, but

after a year and a half of business, cigarette A

butts and twist ties from hamburger and hot
dog buns have replaced the native green.

This is the scene outside the Sphinx Café
and Hookah Bar every Thursday through
Saturday night. Behind the grill stand Travis
Huntley and Zach Glave, smoking cigarettes
while they ﬂip burgers for the customers.
Beside them is a one liter tip jar, about half
full with $1 bills.

“Hamburgers and hot dogs! Hamburgers
and hot dogs and pulled pork herel?’ Huntley
shouted one Saturday last month.

The customers know Travis Huntley as
T—Rav, although Glave calls him Travis. T-
Rav is only 23, but Glave said that he walks
like he has that “old man swag.”

T—Rav transports all of the food to loca-
tion after he prepares it at his house, only
a few blocks away. Glave and T-Rav start
each night at 10 p.m. and work until 3:30
a.m. —— or until the line dies.

“I’ve never missed a weekend,” T—Rav
said. “I’ve built up popularity here. Missing
a day is not an option. The people expect
me to be here.”

An unlikely businessman

Glave, who is also 23, started working be-
hind the grill after T—Rav mentioned that
he needed some help. Business was starting
to pick up after word spread that there was

“some guy serving hamburgers on a street

corner that are really good.”

Glave said he didn’t have anything else
to do, so he ﬁgured that he could lend a
hand. ' ‘

“The best thing about working for T—Rav
is getting to eat T-Rav’s for free,” Glave said,

chomping into a cheeseburger that oozes -

barbeque sauce out of the sides.
T—Rav and Glave have an odd but sym-
biotic professional relationship that allows

T— Rav’s burgers a hit   

With Pitt students

T-Rav < 9 -

the barbeque business to ﬂourish. T-Rav
has always been entrepreneurial. During
his two years at Clarion University, he ﬁrst
wanted to major in business. He dropped
out because he felt like his money wasn’t
being put in the right place when it came
to his plans for the future, which he still
wasn’t sure of at the time.

He spentla short amount of time with a
conservation organization, but as his term
of service expired he realized that he didn’t
have any plans for how to pay his bills.

Everything seemed to fall right into

__ place. T-Rav used his last paycheck to buy

an old grill from his friend llamy Andrawes,

TRAVIS HUNTLEY

My ultimate
bigger place,

for Best Sandwich this year. The winner
students picked was Primanti Bros. Restau-
rant, and T—Rav felt that if he was running
against such a popular restaurant, then he
must be liked.

“I don’t want to leave the ﬁrst group I
served burgers to,” he said.

No buns, no problem

One night, the line for-hamburgers, hot

Apartment-hunting season starts after break

Pitt’s office of Off-Campus Living has resources for students looking to leave the dorms behind.

Emily Marmion
For The Pitt News

After ﬁnals week comes anew worry for many
Pitt students — ﬁnding a place to live.

But while getting an A might be out of
reach for some students, landing a great
apartment or house doesn’t have to be: Pitt
offers a host of resourcesfor students look-
ing to move off campus, including the Off
Campus Living ofﬁce.

According to the Off— Campus Living web-
site, this ofﬁce provides overviews of rental
information to aid students in ﬁnding appro-
priate off—campus units — both University
owned and otherwise — as well as becoming
a knowledgeable tenant.

Off- Campus Living owns about 300 apart-
ment units in Oakland and Shadyside.

Kevin Stiles, manager of leasing and sup-
port in the Department of Property Manage-
ment, said Off- Campus Living has been open
since the early 1990s.

The OCL website supplies students with
checklists, an overview of tenants’ rights, a
roommate-matching forum and explana-
tions of basic rental information, such as
analyzing a lease. ,

Students are encouraged -to stop by the
ofﬁce at 127 North Belleﬁeld Ave. to ask ques-

tions, use the computers or telephones, pick
up hard copies of information or meet with a
staff member for personal advice on moving
off campus. The OCL office is open Monday
through Friday from‘ 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

But ‘before students start hunting for
the perfect apartment, they need to plan
ahead.

“Students need to decide their param-
eters (location, size, budget, etc.) and allow
a reasonable amount of time to inspect pos-
sible units and meet with landlords,” Stiles
said in an e-mail.

Students looking to live off campus during
the fall semester of 2011 should begin search-
ing for off campus accommodations soon.

OCL will begin accepting applications for
University—owned apartments beginning
the second Monday in January on a ﬁrst—
come, ﬁrst-served basis, according to its
Web site. '

Landlords will also begin showing off-
campus apartments early next semester.

“Students should be asking their friends
and classmates where they live and if they
are happy. For the fall semester, landlords

will typically start showing apartments in '

early spring,” Stiles said.
Steve Glickman, owner of Glickman Real
Estate Development, said he will begin show-

ing his apartments injanuary or February.

Glickman said he advises prospective
students to converse with current tenants
living in his apartments. It is the most ad-
vantageous way for students to learn of a
landlord’s reputation, he said.

Glickman prides himself on being “stu-
dent-oriented.”

“We hold their hand,” Glickman said.

The OCL web site provides students with
an overview of information on how to decode
implications and understand the various
sections of apartment leases.

For example, if a tenant disagrees with a

part of the lease, they should abstain from ‘

signing it. The lease can be modiﬁed with
mutual agreement from both the tenant and
landlord. However, changes to a lease must
be written and then signed by both parties.
Modiﬁcations made orally will not change
the regulations on a lease.

The agreement on rules and regulations
from both parties on a lease is important
in the relationship between tenants and
landlords.

“The majority of complaints can be at-

tributed to breakdowns in communication

between landlords and tenants. It is impor-
tant for each party to understand their rights
and responsibilities when leasing an apart-

ment,” Stiles said in an e-mail.

The ofﬁce’s site also provides students
with a printable “Renters’ Checklist” of
“Questions to ask the landlord,” “Things to
learn about the facility locale and amenities,”
as well as “Safety and Security” questions.

The ofﬁce tries to accommodate each stu-
dent who seeks help from their resources.

“I have never heard of a student that
wanted to rent an apartment but could not
ﬁnd any,” Stiles said.

Although OCL provides Pitt students with
many off-campus housing resources, they do
not administer legal advice.

“We refer students to the SGB, who over-
sees a program that gives students access to
legal advice,” Stiles said in an e-maﬂ.

He issues advice to students prospectively
looking to move off campus in the futurei
“Read your lease carefully. Ask questions and
don’t make assumptions. Become informed
and trust your instincts.”

Pitt junior Laura Greenﬁeld has lived in a
University-owned unit on Meyran Avenue in

, South Oakland for a year and a half.

“.It’s helpﬁil to have someone that is the
head person in control. We also set it up
where everyone is responsible for at least
one bill so the responsibilities are shared,”
Greenﬁeld said. I '

international community and those not in the
government like the glimpse of honesty.”

Price said that working for the government
isn’t a goal, but he isn’t ruling it out either.

“I’m being more careful about my views and
pushing it one way or another,” he said.

. Thea Berthoff, a sophomore majoring in
French, said she hopes to work in governmen-
tal ﬁelds such as intelligence or international
diplomacy. She hasn’t posted anything on Face-
book or Twitte_r, but has been discussing it with

The Pitt News
holiday wish list

The holidays are an excellent time to wish
for things. This time for givingindubitably
doubles as a time for dreaming about what
you’d like to be gifted.

We at The Pitt News give our school the
gift of daily campus news along with an
enjoyable serving of opinions, arts, enter-
tainment and sports. In return, we’d like

to make our holiday wish list known to the V

University —— just in case you want to send
some warm and fuzzy love_back our way
this holiday season and next semester.

To start things off, we’d like a ski lift to
operate from upper campus to the Cathe-
dral. Speaking of the Cathedral, how about
adding another 250 feet or so to the top of
it? We’d like to make it the tallest academic
building in the world —— which is currently
the Moscow State University ‘building in
Russia. And you know that rumor about
getting to leave class if your professor
doesn’t show up after 15 minutes? Yeah,
we wish that were a real rule.

On a more serious note, we’d like Uni-
versity administrators to open a dialogue
about an alcohol amnesty policy — which

a would protect underage students seek-
ing medical attention while under the
inﬂuence of alcohol. Given the climate of
college in general and the tendency for
students to binge drink, it only makes
sense to at least discuss it.

In addition, we think the University
should open its financial records. Because
we pay tuition and are therefore Pitt’s
customers, we should know where our
money is going at all times. For example,
the University should disclose information
on coaches’ contract extensions, since

their salaries are some of the highest on
campus. Financial disclosure would also
help justify tuition increases. The students
who weather the price hikes deserve to
know they’re worth it.

As far as campus safety is concerned,
We’d like students to be quickly made
aware of all serious crimes on and off cam-
pus. The Emergency Notification Service
should be used to achieve this.

We also have a few small and simple

» housekeeping issues we’d like to address.

First, we think the escalators in Posvar
should be more reliable. Next, we would
like the toilet seats to ﬁt the toilet bowls
in the Cathedral. Awkwardly sliding off the
toilet is not fun. And finally, victory lights
for the basketball games would be nice.

But our wish list is not just for the Uni-
versity and its administrators.

From students, we simply ask for more
voting and civic engagement — including
being informed on current events. Read-
ing our paper or others would be a great
start. -

For the Student Government Board, our

expectations are a little higher.

We would like the Board to be our voice
on an alcohol amnesty policy as well as on
rising tuition costs.

More Board members should also fol-
low through on their projects, compared

i to previous years.

Above all, we wish for world peace.
Well, and for more students and businesses
to takeout ads in our paper so perhaps we
can one day get a raise.

We hope YOUR «holiday wish lists get
granted this season. Happy Holidays]

How to ace your ﬁnals

Time to get caffeinatend and get busy

I Oliver Bateman
Columnist

Unless you’re some nerdy overachiever, your

ﬁnal exams are bound to come as an unpleas- '

ant surprise. During a semester spent mack-

’ ing, balling, getting swole and slaughtering

innocent civilians during marathon rounds
of Call of Duty 3, how could you have possibly
found time to study? Fear not, true believers:
We’ve never failed to give you the best advice
money can buy, and we’re not about to start
by letting you fail -those’ ﬁnals.

First, you need to make a list of all the
classes you’re taking. We think this can
be done using the Internet, but we’re not
sure. At any rate, the best way to study is
by knowing what to study. If you’ve taken so

ber whether you’re enrolled in U.S. History
to the Civil War or U.S. History After the
Civil War, you should probably ﬁgure that
out. Also, make sure you own some of the
textbooks for these classes. There’s valuable
information in there, and you’re just one or
two all-nighters away from discovering what
that might be.

All—nighters are the best way to learn
anything. After getting warmed up with
a few straight days of heavy procrastina-
tion — watching an entire season of “J ersey
Shore” with an eye toward memorizing the
key lines is a good way to go —- you need
to plan on getting caffeinated and getting
busy. Twenty—four hours before the exam
is the best time to drag your cranked self
tothe library and begin mastering those

e LEX AND THE CITY

I want to be a fisherman

Because you might not fmd a job in your ﬁeld after graduation

Lexie Bond
Assistant Opinions Editor

 

We are surrounded by plenty of distrac-
tions daily. The existence of websites like
YouTube, Facebook and People of Walmart
makes me wonder how anyone gets any work
done at all.» _

But every possible distraction appears
ampliﬁed a thousand times during ﬁnals
week and the days leading up to it. I sit down

_ anticipating a solid study sesh, and four

hours later all I’ve accomplished is watching
12 of the 30 free full episodes of “The Hills”
on Fancast.com. Useful.

This ﬁnals week, however, has brought
on a whole new form of distraction in the
realization that next semester marks the
end of my career at Pitt. No, I’m not about to
get sentimental. My View on sentiment kind
of parallels my view on showering — both
are only necessary for really important oc-
casions._]ust kidding. Maybe.

So no. I’m not sad about graduating. It’s
just interesting to think that receiving an
education is basically all I’ve known my en-
tire life, and now that’s about to come to an
end. I’m sure a lot of us are wondering what’s
next —— unless, of course, you’ve already
scored a full—time paid position in the ﬁeld
you want, in which case I hate you more than
I hate the effect Pumpkin Pie Pop-tarts have

V on my ﬁgure.

If there’s anything I’ve learned in all my
years of schooling, it’s that you need to have
abackup plan. Well, it’s that and how show-
ering every night isn’t as important as your
mother let on.

Realistically, if we don’t ﬁnd jobs after
graduation in the ﬁelds we are currently
studying, what are we going to do?

Don’t worry, I’ve thought about this lon-
ger than I thought about what to name my
future child — no matter what sex it is, I’m
calling it Frankie.

My backup plan for after graduation?
Because the newspaper industry is a sinking
ship, I’ve decided to climb aboard an un-
metaphorical ship. That’s right. I’m going to
be a commercial ﬁsherman. Speciﬁcally, an
Alaskan king crab commercial ﬁsherman.

Although I’ve never caught a ﬁsh in my
life, I can safely put ‘Fexperience catching
crabs” on my resume and hope I don’t get
asked if I’m talking about-crustaceans or a
sexually transmitted infection. Okay, I seri-
ously am kidding about that one.

And even if I’ve never watched Discovery
Channel’s “Deadliest Catch” or been on a
boat more than a dozen times, I know that
commercial ﬁshingis grueling and danger-

ous. According to an article in Business Week ’

called “Worst jobs with the best pay,” crab
ﬁsherman often work for 21 hours straight

unloading 800-pound crab pots. In addi-
tion, “Injuries are common, and with the
Weather conditions in the stormy, icy _Bering
Sea among the worst in the world, falling
overboard is common, too. Statistically, ﬁsh-
ing is the most dangerous job in the country,

with a fatality rate some 30 times higher p

than average.”

Despite these miniscule setbacks, I’ve
also seen “The Perfect Storm” enough to
know that at least my fellow ﬁsherman will
be extremely attractive like George Clooney
and Mark Wahlberg. 5

In addition, the perks of being an Alaskan
king crab ﬁsherman greatly outweigh the

high probability of being eaten by a shark. '

For example, crabbing season can last only
a few days to a few months. While other
ﬁsherman might take on other jobs, this
kind of schedule would leave me the entire

rest of the‘ year, to do what I really enjoy— _
ing doing —— laying by apool and reading

People magazine while snacking on small
cubes of cheese. . '

And although the crabbing season might
be short, the payoff can be huge. Accord-
ing to Businessweek, “There was always
a top boat where the crew members raked
in $50,000 during the three— to ﬁve—day
king crab season — or $100,000 for the
longer snow crab season.” That’s more than
I will probably ever make in a year with my
degree. _

Of course it’s important to note that some
seasons are not as successful as others ——
resulting in a loss instead of a proﬁt.

Like any job, commercial ﬁshing has its
pros and cons. While you may consider a con
something like a long commute, commercial
ﬁshermen have to consider falling overboard
into a sea-monster-ﬁlled ocean.

Nonetheless, I think this is a highly
reasonable and appealing backup plan for
me -—— so long as I get over my fear of the
ocean, sharks, giant squid and long periods
of time without seeing my chinchilla, Mar-
garet Thatcher. ‘

Unfortunately, getting into the com-
mercial crab industry is difI'1cult.'The jobs
are rare and generally ﬁlled by only highly
experienced ﬁshermen. I

So if any commercial crab ﬁshing cap-
tains are reading this, I’ll be looking for
work come May. I might not have a lot of
experience, but I think Discovery Chan-
nel would be more likely to feature you on
“Deadliest Catch” if you had a cute young girl
on board — especially if my work uniform
consisted of a bikini and rain boots. Also, I
am low maintenance and have no problem
notshowering for days at a time. In fact, I
prefer it that way.

If you wish Lexie would shower more

frequently, e-mail her at lexluthorbond@
gmail.com. I A A I

FOREPLAY ON WORDS

Don’ t be aho, ho, hoover holiday break

Be cautious when it comes to holiday hook—ups

Leah Trimble
Columnist

It’s that time of year again, where ﬁnals
are in progress. We all look forward to the
ﬁnale, when we can make an escape from
rigorous classes, ‘our part—time jobs, the
roommates or .friends that we might just

need a little time away from and, most com— '

monly,- escape to our homes where we can
relax with family and get together with the
people who have gotten lost amonglthe mix
of distance and harsh schedules.

Among the ugly sweater parties and base-
ment get—togethers, we have the chance to
reconnect with our old high school friends
and even our lovers. With our bodies aching
with stress, looking for a way to loosen up
isn’t _a particularly bad idea. And hey, it’s
winter break — with no homework to worry
about, a little fun is deﬁnitely in order.

That’s why it’s not a surprise to anyone
when they don’t ﬁnd Mommy kissing Santa
Claus under the tree, but instead see you and
your old ﬂame glowing like the lights that
cover the neighborhood houses.

What can you expect? After months of
time spent in the city, unless you’re from a
spectacular area, going home doesn’t offer
the most exciting choices of entertainment.
I can personally relate in that my hometown
offers only a movie theater and a bowling
alley. So at the end of the night, when other

options refuse to present themselves, it’s
no wonder why everyone’s cell phones are
blowing up with texts and calls from those
looking to do something, or someone. i
Ex—boyfriends and girlfriends aren’t the
only ones playing this game. There’s the
hottie who decided to stick with community

college, the older boy who might not have

noticed you before you graduated and, for
some people, the younger senior girl who
has “grown up” and is just old enough to

from there. When I come back to school,
we completely stop talking until I make
the next trip home. It’s not like I purposely
do it, it’s just like something different and
exciting for me and the girl involved to do
when the situation presents itself.”
Though Fm not completely against this
process of going home and getting some, I
recommend proceeding with caution, espe-
cially with former boyfriends or girlfriends.
Attachment can easily be reintroduced,

Though I’m not completely  
against this process of going

  mend proceeding with caution.

hit on. Either way, meetings are set up and
people "make use of their open schedules.
There are even a few people who start
_making moves in advance, making sure that
they will have “opportunities” in place. My
friend Erik Gertz says, -“It’s just so easy.
I will text girls before I come home, and

ifI don’t, they will contact me. When we .

meet up, we just start ﬂirting, and it goes

particularly if the split was a recent deci-
sion. If you have no good feelings about
getting back together, just avoid hooking
up altogether. You’1l thank me later.

For those who have other people on their
wish list, be careful of the consequences.
Though. there is a small chance, I give the
same warning. People get attached easily,
and if consistent communication with this

person is something you are not interested
in, you might want to rethink your upcom-
ing plans. «;.;=.

Above all, I’m not one to ﬁnd things typi-
cally inappropriate.

But I do ﬁnd having sex or fooling around
with someone still in high school to be to-
tally tasteless, not to mention sometimes
illegal. We are in a different time of our lives,
a period of life that isn’t compatible with
going to prom and after-school activities. I
don’t care what the age difference might be,
ﬁnd someone else to have fun with.

‘ Not to mention that, just like in high
school, the same pertains to coming back
from college.

People like to talk, and your experienc-
es won’t stay secret for long. If all of your
friends getting on you or joking with you
constantly doesn’t bother you, then feel free
to open up to this trend. If gossip isn’t your
thing, this situation isn’t either.

If you do decide to go for it, as always,
wear protection. No one wants to ﬁnd out
that they have an STD or are going to have a
baby with someone they barely speak to.

Let’s make it through ﬁnals, and look
forward to the perks of being on break.
However you decide to spend your break,
relax and enjoy it. For those of you opting
out of the above shenanigans, have a great
holiday! And for the rest of you horny col-
lege kids, have aholly, jolly hook-up!

berger. But wait —— did your good friend Em-
ily Twiggs just post a new picture of herself
on Facebook? Is she holding a Four Loko"

' and giving the middle ﬁnger? Oh crap, you

totally have to comment on that: “luv u em
ur gr8.” And hey, what happened on “Glee”

last night? Did that one really attractive girl
sing the pop hit that never fails to tug at
your fragile heartstrings? Then — check-
ing e-mails!‘ You deﬁnitely need to send an

emergency e-mail to the instructor so that _

he or she knows you’re on top of things.
Okay, now you’ve got to focus..Remem—
ber, these exams are your future. You need to
pass them if you want to attend law school,
med school, business school or whatever
other kind of school you think is your mid-
dle-class birthright. But whoa — that person
over there is so hot! You can’t stop staring at
him or her. God, what a distraction. This is

’ getting out of hand. Now back to the study-

ing either pre‘-Civil War history or post—Civil
War history. Which one was it, again?

Wait a minute. You took AP U.S. History
in high school, didn’t you? You have this stuff
down cold. Emancipation Proclamation,
Thomasjeiferson, Honest Abe, barbed wire,

Martin Luther King,_]r. — you could write an
essay on any of those topics. You could even
write an essay that combined all of them. Do
you think that’s what the instructor wants?
Time to shoot him another e-mail.

Before. you return to T.j. and Abe and
Martin, you have to check that fantasy foot-
ball lineup. Peyton Hillis _starting against
the Ravens defense —- really? A slow, easy-

‘ to—tackle converted fullback against the

best front line in the NFL? Really? Really?
Speaking of that, let’s watch a few of those
hilarious SNL “Really?” sketches. Man, Seth
Meyers sure is a cutie pie.

Ugh, where did the time go? It’s two
hours before the exam and you’re as groggy
as “Big” Ben Roethlisberger was after he
received that punishing strike from Richard
Seymour. Hey, are they still selling Four
Lokos? Could a Four Loko save the day? You
begin running to the 7-Eleven, then remem-

ber that the FDA banned that hot college
beverage a few weeks ago.

Well, so be it. It’s now or never. You hurry
to the classroom and prepare to write the
history essay of your life.‘You think back
to those movies where plucky heroes like

. you relied on their wits to overcome crusty

deans and vindictive professors. You start
writing in your exam booklet. Sure enough,
it’s the thesis sentence of a lifetime: “The
presidency of Thomas Jefferson lasted for
more than two centuries, then it ended.”

Martin Luther King, Jr. couldn’t have
put it better, friends. After you start rack-
ing up those A-pluses, you can send us a

“The Nutcracker”
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
Benedum Center
Now-Dec. 26
Tickets: $20.75-$90.75
,3itt Arts Tickets: $13.75-$17.50

When it comes to holiday traditions, few
have been as enduring in the United States
as “The Nutcracker.”

“[‘The Nutcracker’] is just one of those
feel-good Christmastime stories,” said

’~3Nicholas Coppula, a corps dancer at the

Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. Because many
people already know the story, “even
[those] who are not familiar with ballet
can get something out of the show.”

One of the most popular ballets of all
Egime, “The Nutcracker” enters the imagi-
nation of Clara (or Marie, depending on

the performance), who dreams on Christ-
mas Eve that her new toy nutcracker has

.-;.4.~.

‘l.'.'

transformed into a prince from the Land
of Sweets. After fending off an attacking
horde of life—size mice, the prince takes
Clara to his kingdom, where the Sugar
Plum Fairy has been ruling in his stead.

“The Nutcracker” is perhaps most fa-
mous for its divertissement, which fea-
tures a sequence of dances adapted from
around the world. These scenes offer the
most virtuosic dancing sections of the bal-
let and feature many of the most famous
elements of Tchaikovsky’s musical score,
which were also made popular by Walt Dis~
ney’s 1940 animated classic “Fantasia.”

“‘The Nutcracker’ has been famous for
a long time ever since William Chris-
tensen and George Balanchine made it
hugely successful in the ’40s and ’5os,”
said the theater’s artistic director Ter-
rence Orr.

Christensen, who has been widely cred-
ited with the resurgence of American bal-
let, brought the ﬁrst full-length version
of “The Nutcracker” to American audi-
ences in 1944. The production featured
original choreography by Christensen and

Erin Halloran dances her way across the stage in Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s version of “The Nutcracker”

premiered in San Francisco. Ten years
later, Balanchine choreographedsa ver-
sion of the ballet in New York that is still
performed every year. “The Nutcracker”
was originally choreographed by Russian
choreographer Lev Ivanov in 1892.

Many companies have tried to differ-
entiate their own performances of “The
Nutcracker.” In 2002, Orr choreographed
his own version for Pittsburgh Ballet The-
atre.

_ “I wanted to bring something new to
Pittsburgh. I wanted to add more dancing
and more narration of the story, including
nuances of the city,” he explains. “There
are at least 347 nuances about Pittsburgh
in our ‘Nutcracker.’”

Many of them involve set design. From

the Macy’s clock which hangs above the

stage and keeps time during the perfor-
mance, to a Heinz delivery truck from
1906 that spells “Pittsburgh” without the
“h,” to an image of the Stahlbaum man-
sion that appears to have been plucked

-COLUMN,

Christmas
classics can
be bizarre  

Tracey Hickey

Staﬂ” Writer ,

My little sister has autism. At the age of
17 — going on 18 — she still believes in

Santa Claus and delights in Christmas '

specials. And like most children, Katie
can enjoy a good Christmas movie not
just in December, but whenever the hell
she feels like it.

So although I might not -be an expert
on Christmas specials, I have seena lot

' of them. _I have seen a lot of them many,

many times. I can sing the Heat Miser’s
and Cold Miser’s theme songs from “The
Year Without a Santa Claus” from memory
without a prompt. I can also sing “Put One
Foot In Front Of The Other” from “Santa
Claus Is Comin’ to Town.” Or the Grinch’s
theme song. You can only imagine what
a hit this makes me at parties.

But despite my childhood attachment

’ to and musical memory of these ﬁlms,

many of them are bizarre, depressing
or even stuffed with anachronistic social
messages. So, without further ado, I pres-
ent the Five Weirdest Christmas Specials
I Loved As A Child. '

“A Charlie Brown Christmas”

The Charlie Brown Christmas special,
in which the titular character searches
for the meaning of Christmas amid the
rampant materialism surrounding him,
is a classic. But like most.Charlie Brown
specials, it is a classic that might make
you want to eat a pint of ice .cream —
alone.

Though it might have been funny when
I was a kid, nowadays watching Charlie
Brown wilt under his classmates’ jeers
of “You. ruin everything!” just makes me
feel pained. I’m not the ﬁrst to feel this
way:Charles Schulz admitted to receiving
letters of outrage when he concluded the
Peanuts comic strip without ever letting

Charlie Brown kick the football that Lucy ‘

perpetually pulled out from under him.

Local band A Whisper Rising, like the city
of Pittsburgh itself, is the product of growth
and renewal. ' '

Consisting of "guitarist/vocalist Chris
O’Neal, keyboardist/ lead vocalist Luke An-
derko, lead guitarist Joe Molnar, drummer

l Corey Saracco and bassist and Pitt senior

’ Ben Bowers, the band has made leaps and
bounds in its sound since O’Neal and Saracco
began playing together in high school.

“We started off playing completely dif-
ferent music than what we do now, it’s just

as our music taste matured we progressed,” ‘

O’Neal said. . - _
A Whisper Rising’s members had an
eclectic mix of early interests — from Bow-
ers’ early afﬁnity for Hootie 8: the Blowﬁsh to
the self-proclaimed “Linkin Park nerdiness”
of Saracco. As for its, current sound, the
musicians cite hardcore genre heavyweight

August Burns Red as one of their bigger .’

‘ inﬂuences.

When it comes to writing songs, O’Neal
said A Whisper Rising employs a collabora-
tive approach. ‘ ' P

— “Usually one of us will just bring some-
thing up and we’ll all work it out and develop
a rhythm and eventually a song,” he said.

A Whisper Rising has undergone several
lineup changes, as well as the inevitable
growing pains. Its ﬁ1l1—length album —— The
Approaching Storm, to be released Satur-
day —- has been in the making for more
than a year. =

7‘We’ve been writing the songs for this CD
for over ayear and recently have been work-

» ‘ing on perfecting the songs for the stage,”

Saracco said.

During that period, the band gained a
new bassist: political science major Bow-
ers.

“I saw these guys play and was amazed by I

the sheer talent present and I knew I wanted
to be part of this,” Bowers said. ,

Bowers, who will graduate from the
School of Arts & Sciences this December,
said his time at Pitt was conducive to the
growth of his music. ’

“Pitt isn’t an easyschool, so deﬁnitely
in being a student here I’ developed a work
ethic and organization skills that have car-
ried over into the band,” he said.

Bowers also noted that being a Pitt stu-

dent allowed him to network successfully.

“Being a student here, you meet a lot of
different people who can help you in various
ways,” he said. . '

. The band itself -has recently seen an
astounding growth in local music involve-
ment. A L .

“Right now the music scene in Pittsburgh

‘ is the best that there’s been in years. There

are more venues opening — especially the
new Stage AE on North Shore that will deﬁ-
nitely bringa bunch of bands. Overall, good
things are happening in Pittsburgh music,”
Anderko said. , — ~

As’ for the online music community,
Bowers called social networking sites “a
band’s best friend,” although O’Neal said
the Internet often detracts from a focused
fanbase. _ .

“We are exposed to a much larger audi-
ence, but there’s so much on the Internet
nowadays that people, may not pay as much
attention to your music as you’d like,” O’Neal
said. « ~ — ~

Whatever the case, A Whisper Rising is

grateful for all. its new fans, andhopes its

upcoming Christmas extravaganza —rfea-
turing band members dressed-as Santas and
sexy elves selling merchandise —— will be, in
Bowers’ words, a “sheer epic” show.

FEATURE

‘MadMen’ and military jackets both A&E favorites

Staﬁ” Report

With 2010 winding down, the Arts 8: Enter-
tainment section deliberated on some of our
favorites from the year. Here we bring you
our favorite TV show, CD, movie, book and
fashion trend.

Best TV Show: Tie between “The Walking
Dead” and “Mad Men” 7
Needless to say, it’s been a good year for
AMC: In 2010, the network slowly but surely
supplanted HBO as the capital of quality tele-
vision. Leading the charge was the stellar
fourth season of “Mad Men,” inwhich Don
Draper struggles to regain control of his frag-
mented personal life, and new series “The
Walking Dead,” a “Lost”—like drama with
relatable characters and FCC—trying gore.
Although the former plumbs the dark depths
of a “sophisticated” life, and the latter, the
transparent horrors of a survivalist one, both

shows occupy television’s upper echelon of

quality. Other networks, watch and learn.

Best CD: Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark
Twisted Fantasy

Second-for—second, track—for-track, is
there any album fresher or more exhilarat-

ing than Kanye West’s triumphant return to
hip—hop, My Beautiﬁzl Dark Twisted Fantasy?
To borrow a popular tagline, there’s some-
thing for everyone: the gleefully demented
“Monster” for hardcore hip—hop fans; the
pulsing “Power” for arena—rock aﬁcionados;

cliché to a completely different level, the
Christopher Nolan ﬁlm was one of the most /
innovative plot lines we’ve seen in a while.’
With beautiful cinematography — com-
plemented "by gorgeous actors like Joseph
Gordon—Levitt +—- the movie deftly explores

Think David Sedaris, but as a thirty-

something Woman With spacial aware-

ness challenges instead of OCD.

“Dark Fantasy” and “All of the Lights” for the
classically inclined. Despise, our dislike of
or ability to merely tolerate his personality,

,Yeezy’s music is indisputably irresistible.

Naturally, he realizes as much: “My presence
is a present / Kiss my ass,” he commands in
“Monster.” V A

Best Movie: “Inception”
Taking the “maybe it was all a dream”

the inner workings of the mind. With a de-
ceptively simple start that layers on com— ,
plexity until the viewer is caught up in the
labyrinth of the dream world, the ﬁlm kept
us thinking without being overly confusing. "
For its creativity and unnerving story line,
“Inception” stuck in our minds as the best
movie of 2010. -

 

Best Book: “How Did You Get This Num-

ber” by Sloane Crosley ""‘

Sloane Crosley’s second book “How Did
You Get This Number” is every ounce as witty
and entertaining as her debut “I Was Told
There’d Be Cake” and twice as gorgeously
written. We could love her for her titles alone,
but the memoirist’s essays of the everywomag.»
Manhattan resident are brilliant. Some pieces
are pure observational Wit; others manage
to be heartbreaking yet hilarious all at once.
Think David Sedaris, but as a thirty-some-
thing Woman with spatial awareness chal-
lenges instead of OCD. Crosley’s adventures
run the gamut from roommate drama to ama-
teur Portuguese clown troupes and Alaskan
weddings to being banned from the entire
city of Paris. We highly recommend curling
up with this book during winter break.

Best Fashion Trend: Military meets Girly

This year there were a bevy of super—cute
looks that were en vogue, but our favorite
was the structured—meets—feminine look of
military jackets cut for wo men — particularly
when paired with a ﬂirty lace top. The look
gives that commanding presence without
the bulky and overly—masculine shoulder pad
trend of the ’80s. And with the addition of a
frilly dress or top, it makes a perfect addition
to any wardrobe, making the wearer look
fashionable for work or play. I

Revis-ting kids'favorites  

Some of the best-loved childreri’silnrovies ore_‘qlso the oddest

TV specials 4 1t}

Deadspin.com’s Drew Magary condemns
“A Charlie Brown Christmas,” calling it
and similar showsl“th‘e animated mani-
festations of some asshole’s clinical de-
pression” and complaining that it made
his daughter sad for a week.

“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer”

With its lovable characters, classically
wish-fulﬁlling misﬁt-becomes-hero nar-
rative and adorable reindeer romance,
this ﬁlm is undeniably charming. But Ru-
dolph is unﬂatteringlydated by moments
of extraordinary sexism. “This is man’s
worl<-,l_.”, Ru’dolph’s fat-l1_er Donner tells Ru-

dcolplji’ls mother and love interest when

they“/express eagerness to come along on
the search for Rudolph. When they defy
his wishes and set out to ﬁnd him alone,
they are captured by the Abominable
Snowman. While this anachronistic line
is hilarious to a modern viewer,- it’s off—,
putting to watch with a kid who doesn’t
know better. ’

“Rudolph” wins bonus problematic
points for the song “Silver and Gold,”
atouching musical number about the
importance of bling. g

“The Year Without a Santa Claus”~

Based on a 1956 children’s book, “The
Year Without a Santa Claus” explores
the consequences of Santa’s becoming
disillusioned with his work and taking a
year off from his annual Christmas gift-
delivering duties. His elves Jingle and

_]angle go off in search of believers to -

prove that Santa is needed, but end up
stranded in the small, creatively named
Southern town of Southtown, where their

reindeer is mistaken for a dog and taken ‘

to the pound. The mayor agrees to release
their dog only if they can prove they are
Santa’s elves by making it snow in swel-
tering Southtown on Christmas. Mrs.
Claus must act as a diplomat between

 

bickering brothers Heat Miser and Snow
Miser to make the miracle possible. From
the name Southtown to theconceit that
a rei_ndeer_could,,be mistaken for a dog,
this is a strange,‘ strangetﬁlm.

’ “A Christmas Story”

Admittedly hilarious, this Christmas
cult classic about young boy’s yearning
for a BB gun for Chris-tmas is usually aired
in 24-hour marathons on_Christmas _Day.
I know several Jewish families whose
Christmas traditions involve watching
this movie and going out for Chinese.
But despite its self-aware comedyénd
beloved status as the anti- C,liristmas,,S:pe-
cial, “AvChristmas Story” is still totally
bizarre + from the triumphant conclu-
sion (the boy gets the BB gun, actually
does come within inches of shooting his
eye out, and nevertheless maintains that
it’s the best Christmas gift he’s ever re-
ceived) to that creepy, creepy leg lamp.

‘_‘Santa Clause is Comin’ to Town”?

This Rankin/Bass special is the weird-
est'Christmas ﬁlm ever. Presumably or-
phaned at birth, Kris Kringle is raised
by elves and grows up to smuggle toys
to the children of Sombertown, which
is ruled by an emotionally regressed,
toy—loathing dictator, for some reason
named Burgermeister Meisterburger.
Kringle wins the heart of the pretty
schoolteacher Missjessica by giving her
the doll she always wanted for Christmas.
He and his friends are taken as political
prisoners, escape, and have to run to the
North Pole,‘where Kringle grows a beard
as a disguise and takes his birth name
Claus. Was this 1970 ﬁlm supposed to
be to be about the Soviet Union? In any
case, despite its incomprehensibility to

a grown viewer, this ﬁlm is delightful‘

for children, who aren’t used to seeing
Santa as a dashing outlaw. ‘_;_;

More shows of family favorite

The theatre will have extra performances of “The Nutcracker”

Nutcracker 4 i8

straight out of Shadyside, Pittsburgh Ballet

Theatre’s rendition of the ballet invokes '

allusions to Yinzer culture.

Orr also sets theater’s version apart in
other ways.

“[He] puts a lot of emphasis on the par-
ty scene, which I really like,” said soloist
Eva Trapp, who will perform the parts of
Marie, the Snow Queen, the Sugar Plum
Fairy and others throughout the season.

Orr: also likes to change small aspects
of the ballet from year to year, modifying
choreography in certain places and adding
new effects. This season, the company’is
especially excited about a new element of
magic in the production involving a pirate
who jumps out of a stack of gift boxes. Even
though the pirate is dressed in standard

T pirate habiliments, he is meant to be a

reference to the Pittsburgh Pirates.

The Pittsburgh details are important
because “The Nutcracker” is a special part
of the theater’s repertoire.

“It’s ourlargest production  It’s part
of how a lot of families celebrate the holi-
day season,” said Associate Nutcracker
Brand Manager Mandy Wilson. This year,
the theater will offer 17 performances,
which’ is well above average for a single
ballet (their last production, “The Three

‘A

Musketeers,” had four). She said that
the production was also weathering the
lackluster economy. Ticket sales for “The
Nutcracker” are up 6 percent from last
year, and the company has added two more
performances to its schedule. .3
Because “The Nutcracker” draws a more
family-oriented crowd than the theater’s
other ballets, the company participates in
a lot of family-oriented events throughout
Pittsburgh. For instance, two weeks ago,
at the Phipps Conservatory, the company
offered short performances of the diver-
tissement and pas de deux by students
from the theater’s ballet school. Not only
does this get families excited about the
upcoming season, Wilson observed, but
“it gives our younger students a chance to

gain more performance experience.” ,4.-

While it is said that some ballet com-
panies must rely on “The Nutcracker” to
maintain a sufficient revenue stream, Wil-
son was unable to offer information about
whether this is true for at Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre, or whether the theater makes a
net gain from “The Nutcracker.” She did
say, however, that the majority of its total
income is endowment-related, with about
40 percent earned income coming from
ticket sales and its school.

FOOTBALL

‘Kentucky

Dustin Gabler
‘E » Staff Writer

A January bowl against an SEC
team sounded like a mission ac-

complished for the Panthers in ,

August.

But instead of a Sugar Bowl
or BCS National Championship
against an SEC team, Pitt will
head to the BBVA Compass Bowl

in Birmingham, Ala., to face 6-6

Kentucky onjan. 8.

.37; Although disappointing con-
sidering the preseason hype,
the Panthers will have a chance
to beat a Kentucky team that
hails from what many consider
the best conference in the na-
tion. A

“What a tremendous oppor-
tunity our football program
has,”_ former Pitt head coach
Dave Wannstedt said in a news
release. “I know our team is ex-
cited about thechallenge. We

“appreciate the invitation to play
in Birmingham and look for-
ward to a great experience on
and off the field.”

It’s uncertain at this point
whether Wannstedt, who re-
cently resigned, will coach the
game. At a press conference
announcing the" resignation
last Tuesday, athletic director
Steve Pederson said Wannstedt
would have the option to coach
the game and see the season

"through. A

Defensive coordinator Phil
Bennett told the Pittsburgh

done an exceptionaljob growing

Luc Felak I Senior Staff Photographer

Pitt’s receiverjon Baldwin squares off with at Notre Dame defender in October. The Panthers will face
‘ Kentucky next in thejan. 8 BBVA Compass Bowl.

 

Pitt athletic director Steve Ped-

erson said. “We look forward
to some tremendous southern
‘hospitality and the chance to

square off against an SEC op-

ponent.”

The Panthers finished the V

regular season at 7-5 (5-2 Big
East). The bowl game gives this
young team almost a month to

‘prepare for the game and a

chance to cap off an otherwise
disappointing season.
A win could propel Pitt, to

‘ﬁnish strong on the recruiting

trail and head into the spring
on a positive note.

But the Panthers have to stop
Kentucky’s junior wide receiver
Randall Cobb. He leads the Wild-
cats in receiving with 955 on’.79
catches and is second in rushing
with.423 yards on 52 carries.
He was selected as a first team
SEC al1—purpose player, and was
named to the second team as a
wide receiver. 

Cobb will look to stretchthe
ﬁeld against a Pitt secondary
that has struggled this season,
and the Panthers’ offense will
try to continue. its success

against Cincinnati. The Bearcats

were unable to slow sophomore
running back Dion Lewis, as he
carried the ball 42 times for 261
yards and four touchdowns, all
career highs, in the game on
Dec. 4.

“It will bea huge challenge
and an exciting -time for our
football program to play injthe
BBVA Compass Bowl,” Kentficky
head coach Joker Phillips said.-
“I’ve had a chance to watch Pitt
numerous times. Their running
attack is very strong and their
quarterback [Tino Sunseri] has
completed more than 65 per-
cent of his passes.”_

Kentucky ranked next to last '

in the SEC againstthe run. The
Wildcats allowed an average of
170.1 yards per game. -The Pan-
thers hope to exploit that.

“Whenever you are able to
get the ball a lot of times, you
have a chance to figure some
things out with the defense and
you get more comfortable,”
Lewis said after the last regu-
lar season contest. “I just have
to stay patient.” I A

MEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Big East starting strong

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

Heading into this season, college basket-
ball experts were expecting the Big East to
have a down year in men’s basketball.

With only four teams in the preseason
Top 25 and teams like Connecticut and
West Virginia notexpected to do very
well, many expertsgwere proclaiming ei-
ther the Big Ten or ACC as the new best
conference in college basketball.

But with just over a month of the
season gone, the results and statistics
suggest that the ‘Big East is as strong as
ever. A

Four Big East teams remain undefeated
— Syracuse, Connecticut, Louisville and
Cincinnati — and DePaul is the only team
in the league with a losing record.

There are now seven Big East teams
in the Top 25 of the AP poll, including

four — Pitt, Connecticut, Syracuse and '

Georgetown — in the Top 10 as of Sun-
day. C '
After Saturday, the conference’s 16
teams had a combined record of 115-30
and a respectable 7-7 record against Top
25 opposition, with Top 10 teams Michi-
gan State, Kentucky and Missouri all suf-
fering losses against Big East teams.
Even the lesser teams in the confer-
ence begin each season believing their
team can finish the season by earning a
berth in the NCAA Tournament or NIT,
meaning there are no easy games in the

- Big East.

“In our conference it’s always going to
be a battle,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said earlier this year at Big East media
day. “We’re the best conference because
we have the best teams.”

“We know we’ve got the toughest
league in the country, the best league
in the country,” Syracuse guard Scoop
Jardine said. ’

Big East teams boast a 21-12 total re-
cord against teams from the other five
power conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12,
Pac 10, SEC), with no conference having a
winning record against Big East teams.

journalists aren’t the only people sur-
prised by the success the league has had
early in the season.

“I think the Big East is a lot better than

V. people thought, including myself,” Lou-

isville head coach Rick Pitino said. “I’m
still not sure that we’re not the strongest
conference in basketball.”

One of the main reasons the stats once
again validate the Big East as one of the
best conferences in the nation might be
the pride each team carries in represent-
ing the conference during nonconference
matchups. '

“We want to show the country that the
Big East is still the best basketball con-
ference,” Pitt senior Gilbert Brown said

A prior to the Tennessee matchup.-“Making

a statement is really important to us to
show‘ what type of level [the Big East]
brings.”

“We’re representing the Big East. We
still say it’s the best conference in the
nation so we want to go out there and
show that and defend our conference,”
Pitt senior Gary McGhee said.

The Big East also boasts arguably the
nation’s best player right now in Con-
necticut’s Kemba Walker. The junior
guard is averaging just over 28 points
per game and is the main reason that the
Huskies are the No. 6 team in the country
right now.

With the majority of nonconference
play coming to an end after New Year’s
Day, the debate over what is the best con-
ference in the nation will experience a
hiatus until the NCAA Tournament rolls
around in March. 1

But for now, there is no doubt theBig
East has proved it deserves to be in any
conversation about the best conference
in college basketball. It .

Woodall brings grit, toughness to poi

Isaac Saul
Staff Writer

The common characteristics of a New_

York City-bred basketball player are

well documented — gritty, tough, ’

strong and prideﬁil. The Big Apple is
home to a jaw—dropping number of
Basketball legends, from Kareem to
Dr.] to Billy Cunningham.

If you narrow your search to the
borough of Brooklyn, the list will

, continue to impress with names like

Carmelo Anthony — and you might
have heard of Michaeljordan aswell.
On that same list of Brooklyn—bred
players who representtheirbackyard,
youwillﬁnd Pittsburgh’s own Travon
Woodall.

Woodall, a redshirt sophomore .

with the Pitt basketball team, has
personiﬁed thatNewYork style since
arriving in the Steel City. During his
ﬁeshman seasnn, Woodall suffered a
devastating knee injury that left him
on the sideline and eamedhimamedi—
cal redshirt.

“I tell people allthe time; it hurt not
being able to do anything to help my

team,” he said. “But just sitting back

: \

nt guard

and watching Levance [Fields] be a

ﬂoor leader and the prime example “

of a general, that helped me progress
as a player.”
Fields, who will go down as one

. of the best to ever don the Panther

uniform, had a signiﬁcant impact on

the path ofWoodall’s career. One ofthe at

things Woodall tries to replicate from
Fields’ game is his assist—to—tumover
ratio.

4 “Normally, I was just going out
there playing, not really caring about

- how many tumovers I had,” Woodall

said. “After playing with a guy like
Levance, and thinking about how
important itwas to him, he averaged
almost four to one [assists to turn-

_ overs]. I realized to be a good point

guard, that’s key.”

Last season, Woodallﬁnishedwith -'~ ‘

ateam leading 1.86 assist—to-turnover
ratio. In the season’s ﬁnal 10 games,
he compiled a 3.22 assist—to-turnover
ratio, showing drastic improvementin
the category. The improvement has

continued into this season.
“Ithinkthat having that ﬁrst year
go by and learning how to play 
the system, he’s really taking advan-
tage of it,” senior forward Gilbert
Woodall > 28

Brown said. “He has asserted himselfreally well
and he’s shown it with his playmaking abili ,
creating for other people and knocking down
those open sho .” I

Up to this pointinthe season, Woodall has a
2.85 assist-to—turnover ratio, whichranksthird in
the BigEast. Withhis success, Woodallhasbeen
seeinganincreased role on the ﬂoor, buthe also
understands thathis success hasn’t come because
he is trying to be someone he isn’ﬁ

“I understand there are alot of guys that came
here from the N.J.—N.Y. area, but all I can do is
play my game,” Woodall said. “I’m not going
to tryand be anybody else but myself. I can’t
be Levance, I can’t be B. Knight, I can’t even be
Ashton [Gibbs] .”

Thebeauty ofWoodall’s mentalityisthatwhen
he plays the game, his roots shine through.

“Hehasthat scrappiness,” Brown said. “Step-
ping in there and taking those charges, you see
the toughness that the Newjersey and Brooklyn
guys tend to have when Travon plays.”

Along with the Brooklyn tag, you will also
hear many people associate Woodall with the
term “true point guard.” The term is associated

‘with pass-ﬁrst, strong-minded and ball- distrib-
uting guards like" John Stockton, who shined
while playingfor the Utahjazz. To Woodall, being
a true point guard has a lot of meaning.

“It’s being the coach on the ﬂoor,” Woodall
said. “Make sure everybody knows where they’re

going to be, like the quarterback. If anything bad
happens to the team it falls on you, but at the
same time, if you win, you can be the ﬁrst one
people praise.” ’

As this season has unfolded, Pitt’s offensive
production has shown improvement in large
part due to this mentality. So far this season,
Pitt has scored 80 points in six different games.
In all of last season, they hit the 80-point mark
ﬁve times. i

The team’s chemistry is one of the main rea-
sons many people see the Panthers in Houston
for the Final Four come April. For players like
Travon Woodall, Ashton Gibbs and Nasir Rob-
inson _— who have all known each other since
the seventh grade — this chemistry was a long
time coming.

“Me and Ashton, ou'r chemistry has built
tremendously,” Woodall said. “I come inthe lane
and I’m just throwing the ball because I already
know where he is going to be.”

Their development has helped Woodall pro-
duce 6.9 points and 4.1 assists per game as a
spark off the bench. With the Panthers’ early
success, theirexpectations have continued to
rise along with the fans’. Along with Woodall’s
personal goal of graduating this summer with
a degree in communication, Woodall has one
clear goal for the team: I

“I’mtryingto go to Texas',”Woodall said with
a smile. “I’ve never been to Houston before.” I
