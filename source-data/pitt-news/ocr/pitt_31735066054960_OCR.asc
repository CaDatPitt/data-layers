THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SINCE l906

 

SB candidates gear up r election

Jason Gallinger

Assistant News Editor ‘

One of the questions asked of the
contenders for Student Government
Board president at the Meet the
Candidates forum was whether any of
them knew Pitt’s alma mater.

Of the three students running for
president, only one could say that he
did. George Mongell stepped before the
audience of approximately 150 people
and sang.

People stood, and some sang along
to Mongell’s quavering voice. But it

‘was business as usual during the rest of

the forum, held last night in the David
Lawrence Auditorium as an opportuni-
ty for students to hear candidates’ posi-
tions and ideas.

Campaign issues of the l2 board
candidates ranged.from the process of
allocating money to student groups, to
bolstering Pitt pride. ‘

“We are all Pitt; we are all
Panthers,”
Lander. “We should all know that and
respect each other.”

There were, however, a few domi-
nant issues that occupied the majority
of the candidates’ attention: increasing
communication between student groups

and. student government, campus safety

and food’ services. ' -

Presidential candidate Christophe
Boback said that as student-govern-
ment Allocations Committee chairman,
he has learned to work with a diverse
array of student groups, whose con-
cerns he has listened to and tried to
address.

said board candidate David A

ISADORA MURPHY/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR_

From left to right, Safula Lewis, Raymond Murphy, Nicole Showalter, Marques
McKnight, Julie Radford and Ted Rodgers are six of the l2 candidatesrunning for
Student Government Board. Elections are Nov. l8.

He also referredto the “communi-
cation breakdown” that led him and the
rest of the Allocations Committee to

resign last year. He said things will be

different if he becomes president.
“There will be no problems, no
ills,” Boback said. “Communication
will not break down.” _
Board candidate Ted Rodgers said
he wanted to have an open—door policy
for students to approach student gov-
ernment. Mongell and board candidate
Julie Radford mentioned a weekly stu-
dent—government newsletter to report
current projects and accomplishments.
Several candidates said they want
to have more meetings with Pitt’s 200
student groups as a method of fostering

communication. .
Raymond Murphy, a candidate for
board, said that campus safety is an
issue that “keeps [him] awake at
night.” There is an alarming number of
rapes on Pitt’s campus, he said, and the
majority of them go unreported.

Board candidate Joan Snyder said
publication of crime statistics would
help to make students more aware of
Oakland’s dang-ersand help them avoid
becoming victims. '

Laura-Jean LaCasse, a junior run-
ning for the board, agreed that students
must be made more aware of crime.

Grades, financial aid information to be posted online

service.

Joseph K. Gordon

Staff Writer

Pitt’s Web site has a new applica-
tion that improves student services by
allowing them to obtain class sched-
ules and grades, and it is expected to
soon provide access to financial aid
information. ‘

Pitt’s site will also allow students
to print or send a copies of their
schedules via e—mail.

The goal is to improve the

University’s services to students.
“Our hopes are toleliminate stu-
dents standing in long lines inquiring
about their personal financial aid sta-
tus, bill payments, schedules and
grades,” said Robert Pack, a vice
provost who recently took over Pitt’s
Computer Information Services
Division. ' .
“Having access to this type of
information will hopefully give stu-
dents the freedome to enjoy other
aspects of college life,” said Pack.

No other universities use a soft-
ware package of this nature, accord-
ing to project director, Edward
Cutone III. ~ .

The University is the first to let
students have access to their “main
frame” computer base through the
World Wide Web.

Other universities require stu-
dents to buy a specific software pack-
age that enables them to have access
to this type of information. Pitt
requires no additional charge for this

Cutone, who is working in part-
nership with Pack, designed the
application software package to be
student-friendly. .

“The software package was
designed for students to be able to
obtain specific information by log-
ging onto the University’s Web site
and following the simple instructions
provided,” Pack said.

Staff Writer

Tucked away in the Frick’Fine Arts
Building, unknown to many students,
lies a compilation of ancient and mod-
ern art —— the University Art Gallery.

And according to Esther Mallouh,
project director of the gallery, some

students are missing out on a cultural .
experience.

“It’s the only real cultural place in
all of the University. Serious things are
happening,” she said. “Students can
gain cultural exposure.” _

“Creating a Sense of Place:
Devotion Builds a Campus” is the cur-
rent exhibit at Pitt’s University Art
Gallery.-The exhibit, which runs until
Dec. ll, is made up of four separate
exhibits which focus on the diversity of
public art and architecture on campus.
Students from the 1998 Museum
Studies Seminar at Pitt curated pieces
for the exhibit. C

The four exhibits include
“Honoring Cultural Traditions: the 60th
Anniversary of the Nationality
Rooms,” “Heinz Memorial Chapel:
Celebrating 60 Years of Light,” “In the
Public Eye: A Century of Art and
Architecture on Pitt’s Campus,” and
“Over Time: The Art of Jane Haskell.”

“There are great things through this
door,” said Mallouh of the exhibits.

The Heinz Memorial Chapel exhib-
it is the first thing one sees when enter-

cal monument and, according to
Mallouh, an architectural masterpiece.

“It is incredibly beautiful, one of a
kind,” said Mallouh.

Old b1ack—and—white photographs
of the Heinz family’s involvement with
the chapel are on display in this part of
the exhibit.

Photos that reveal the intricate
architecture of the chapel. are also on
display. In one photo, one can see sun
pouring in the heritage window. Other
photos include the pulpit, main
entrance, exterior stone work, the inter-
nal spiralstaircase, and the arch over
the main portal. ‘

Pictures of the panels of stained
glass in the chapel are also part of the
exhibit. The theme of the intricately
designed windows is Christian teaching

and inspiration.The New Testament

window portrays stories in the New
Testament. The Courage Window has a
detail of Florence Nightingale, and the
Tolerance window portrays Lincoln
freeing the slaves. _

The exhibit on the Nationality
Rooms, which includes pieces from
over 20 different countries, is important
for students to see, said Mallouh.

“It shows the diversity of our cul-
ture,” she said. “Each culture has beau-
tiful things.”

The exhibit includes a Bible from

Pitt professor strengthening bond ith Ghana

James Maude
Contributing Editor

Developing a strong pub-
lic sector is crucial to the
development of‘ a strong pri-
vate sector.

This, according to Harvey
White, a professor in iPitt’s
Graduate School of.Public
and International Affairs, is
the reasoning behind the sec-

ond annual International
Conference on Public
Management and

Development Administration
to be held in Accra, Ghana,
June 24-28, 1999. It will be
organized by White and co-
sponsored by GSPIA and
other public service organiza-
tions in the United States and
Africa.

At the first public—service
conference, which White
organized last year in
Johannesburg, South Africa,
White was approached by
Sam Anyimadu—Amaning,
chief executive of environ-
mental technologies of Ghana,
‘who suggested that a similar
conference be held there.

“He said that the experi-
ence was so rewarding, he’d

   

GOERNMENT

like to see similar kinds of
linkages established between
Ghana and the United States,”
White said.

Two hundred public ser-
vice professionals, including
non-African representatives
from the United States,
United Kingdom and India,
attended last year’s conven-
tion and discussed problems
of public service and the
future of the public sector in
African countries.

“This is a chance for the
University to provide a ser-
vice in a developing country,”
White said. “It is also a
chance for us to learn more
about the culture and the peo-
ple of Ghana.”

Representatives from
some African nations, accord-
ing to White, value any links
made with organizations —
both public and private — in
the United States, which is
what the international confer-
ence will provide.

“While we belittle public
service in America, represen-
tatives from Ghana who visit-
ed recently were amazed by
the way it worked, and they
sought to apply a similar

model in Ghana,” White said.

According to White, the
conference will benefit Pitt by
the links it will make with
educational institutions and
organizations.

“The University’s name is
there, and that is likely to lead
to more opportunities for fac-
ulty and students,” White
said.

While at the conference,
representatives from Pitt will

also meet with Ghanian resi-

dents who are- Pitt, alumni,
many of whom hold key posi-
tions in Ghana’s public and
private sectors.

“It’s a chance not only to
create new linkages, but con-
solidate old linkages with
alums,” White said.

Research, study and trav-
el opportunities for Pitt stu-
dents and faculty will be cre-
ated not only in Ghana, but
throughout the whole African
continent. Not only will the
conference provide opportuni-
ties for Pitt students, but it
also will enable Pitt to distrib-
ute information about the
University in order to entice
Ghanian students to study
here. ‘

To log on, students will use their
user ID, Social Security number and
password to access their network
authentication accounts.

By entering the screen name “stu-
dent-info-pitt.edu,” students will be
able to access individual information
normally stored in the “main frame.”
Before developing this system, stu-
dents were required to seek assis-
tance from an administrator to gain
access to their individual accounts.

Student Government Board mem-

ber Mark Murphy said he recently -

visited the Web site and found it to be
a good system for students.

“It is easy to access and will pre-
vent students from standing in long
lines at Thackeray.”

Last summer, members of the
SGB proposed making grades avail-
able over the phone but later lobbied
University officials to have them
posted on the Internet.

Prior to the University’s system
upgrade, faculty members had to
enter students’ grades into the sys-
tem. Once the process was complet-
ed, students received their grades
through the mail, and students got
copies of their schedules when they
registered for classes. a

But when it is time for students to
show up for classes, many lost or
misplaced their class schedules,
Cutone said.

Junior Monica Morris said she
likes the idea of the new system.

“I could never keep track of all
the papers this university gives me
when registering,” she said. “Having
the ability to go online to get my
school schedule is one less thing I
have to worry about.”

The system has been upgraded so
that faculty members can now post
grades online and students can obtain
them by following the log-on proce-
dure. .

Pitt senior Jack Roberts said he
dislikes having to wait for his grades
to come in the mail.

“I think it’s wonderful that Pitt is
allowing us to have access to our
information, and I won’t have to wait
for two weeks after school has closed
to know my grades,” said Roberts.

Pitt’s online services were
upgraded on Oct." 22. Since then,
3,000 students have accessed the sys-
tem.

“This is like a partnership with
students. Things change all the time,
and we want students to be able to
tell us through e—mail the things they
want the Web site to have,” Cutone
said.

The University is notifying stu-
dents of this new service when they
register for classes, and has miniature
billboards posted throughout campus.

“We are on the cutting edge of a
new technology; improving student
services is what we are all about,”
said Cutone.

In an artist’s statement, Haskell
said, “In all of this work there is a com-

and light, which I have based on a min-
imalist aesthetic.”

The gallery features seven works

you,” LaCasse said. She added that
North Oakland is more dangerous
than South Oakland, a fact of which
she said most students are unaware.

Presidential candidate Shavon
Ogunleye, who said she would step
down from her position as president
of the Black
Action Society if
she wins the elec-
tion, wants to see
more lights in
South Oakland.
She said that she
would favor the
installation of
campus emer-
gency telephones
with blue lights on
them but that Pitt
cannot do that
because South
Oakland is the
city’s jurisdiction.

Mike Unangst,
who is running for
the board, took a
harder stance on
b1ue—light emer-
gency telephones,
saying that student government
“cannot roll over” for the sake of a
matter of jurisdiction.

Unangst also spoke out against
the quality and price of the food in
campus eateries. He pointed out
that prices increased 4 percent over
the summer and that food that was
“carefully prepared” last semester
is now “shoved under a heat lamp.”

Students cannot keep their
mouths shut about such issues, he

THE PITT News

said, because if they _do, the
University will never rectify the
problems.

Mongell; Rodgers; Snyder;
Nicole Showalter, the president of
the Campus Women’s Organization
and board candidate; and Michael
Tannous, candidate for board, all
spoke about ‘the need" to improve
food services.

Other issues
that candidates
‘discussed during
the forum includ-
ed: p

- Tannous’
proposals to
install complaint
boxes in dorms
and the William
Pitt Union to help
students voice
their concerns,
increasing the
Sunday hours of
the Hillman
Library and
increasing the fre-
quency of Pitt
shuttles on
Sundays;

0 A proposal
_ by Unangst to get
students involved in the hiring
process of new faculty;

- LaCasse’s goal of bringing
more attention to transfer students
to help ease their transition to the
Oakland campus.

Naturally, every candidate told
the audience why he or she should
be elected.

“I will make your vision ‘of
Pitt’s campus a reality,” Radford
said. ‘

SGB candidates need coherent,
concrete ideas

Pitt pride boring!
Communication among students -
already have it. Next! Campus safety
—— where are the specifics?

Instead of offering generic, well-
worn issues, perhaps student govem-
ment presidential and board candidates
should start addressing concrete issues
and give us substantial ideas to back
them up. While there were certain
issues that dominated the Meet the
Candidates event last night, particular-
ly the allocation of money collected by
the student activities fee, the bolstering
Pitt pride, the improvement of food
services, and campus safety, most can-
didates proved to be little more than
vague.

Like the campaigns of the bigger
cats in Washington, D.C., the art of
being speciﬁc eluded many candi-
dates

A couple of candidates revised the
campus safety issue. They said that as
SGB members, they’d have emer-
gency phones placed all over South
Oakland, even though Pitt doesn’t
have the legal right to do so. Pitt can’t

put its phones on city property.
At Meet the Candidates, students

1 found out that SGB presidential candi-

date George Mongell could sing the
alma mater. While we respect his
singing ability, we wonder‘ why the
three presidential candidates were

asked if they knew the song, anyway.
Pitt pride is a tired topic; thankfully, it
was not a dominant theme of the
evening. We’re all proud of Pitt —— let’s
move on.

As for food services, many candi-
dates were eager to get the University
to show them its contract with
Sodexho and to make suggestions for
changes. Suggestions offered by can-
didates included lowering food prices
and improving the quality of the food
offered. However, none mentioned
how they were going to go about it.

If candidates are going to be con-
sidered serious candidates, they’re
going to have to start coming up with
concrete ideas during the coming
week. Since most candidates appear to
have put a substantial amount of
research into their campaigns, it would
be logical for them to start formulating
cohesive plans. Why beat around the
bush when you can prove that you
have an issue which you can master
and have a good way to tackle it?

Save the rhetoric for the commu-
nications class. Elections should be
about the distribution of ideas and vot-

‘ ers choosing candidates who look like

they know what they’re talking about

Candidates who know what
they’re talking about and have a con-
crete platform will win elections.
Those who don’t won’t.

Up until the Nov. 3 election of Jesse “The
Body” Ventura as governor, Minnesota was
well-known for things like wind—chill factors and
giant malls. But now there’s a new reason for
pwple to be aware of Minnesota. Unfortunately,
as a permanent citizen of the Land of 10,000
Lakes, it dispirits me to realize that my home
state is plagued by people who think it’s funny to
vote for a former professional wrestler as their
governor.

I agree with the stalf editorial in the Nov. 5
issue of The Pitt News. I believe that Ventura’s
victory will promote a sense of democracy in
America It is truly a steppingstone for our coun-
try when a third—party candidate can be success-
ful at the state level. '

However, I believe that Minnesotans voted
for Ventura for the wrong reasons. Granted, I do
not currently live there, but I have
lived ﬂrere for the past 18 years. I
have also been inﬂuenced by my
parents, teachers and mentors — all
of whom know much more about
politics than I do. They have helped
me develop my own sense of what is right and
wrong and how to be a better amateur political
analyst

My claim that Minnesotans may have not
used their best judgment in electing Ventura
stems from two main reasons. First, after talking
to folks back home about the election, I learned
that many students voted for Ventura because
they thought it would be “cool.” True, the 18-25
age bracketmakes up only a small portion of the
electorate, but Ventura also captured almost half
the votes from those under age 44, proving his
popularity with the yoimger crowd (possibly
those who don’t have as much political experi-
ence). Another demographic consistency was
thatmanymenvotedforVentura. Ofcourse they
would vote for a guy who at one time symbol-
ized all that is rough and tough in professional
wrestling, a mainstay of the stereotypical yet
often realistic male interest

“The Body” is affiliated with the Reform
Party, and on many issues, he stands in the mid-
dle. He dominated the moderate vote by coming
away with 40 pacent when 53 percent of
Minnesotans call themselves moderates. But he

versial issues, while Ventura stated he would like
to “monito ’ situations before he made any deci-
sions. This is deﬁnitely a moderate stance, but it
is not one of action. I believe it parallels the gen-
eral apathy of the country; American citizens
would much rather wait and see than make hasty
decisions. Those hasty decisions are what moti-
vate action to better society.

The other reason that the election turned out
the way it did was that Minnesotans felt forced
to vote for Ventura because there was no better
candidate. Voters of every political aﬂiliation
were turned olf by Coleman, who switched par-
ties two years ago. Many voters reported that
they saw Humphrey as a fake, so they voted for
Ventura. They didn’t necessarily believe Ventura
was a good candidate, but they thought he was
better than the other two because of the highly
negative aspects of Coleman and
Humphrey.

I simply think there is more
than meets the eye when it comes to
the victory of Jesse Ventura as
Minnesota’s governor. I am disap-
pointed that right now this is what my state is
known for. Trrne after time, when I tell people I
am from Minnesota, they ask me where the state
is, what the Mall of America is like, or whether
the state is cold, or they tell me I talk “funny.”
Come on, there is so much more to Minnesota
than the Mall of America. '

Now I havea new thing to discuss: the elec-
tion of Ventura. But people don’t really care
about the politics involved; they only care that he
a former professional wrestler. I don’t think the
voters of Minnesota were wronginmaking their
decision to elect Jesse Ventura, but I do think
they were Iminformecl

But I can’t subscribe to the ﬂzreory that
Minnesotans voted for Ventura because they
believed he would bring a fresh view to politics
inthestateorthattheyhadany intentionofmak-
ing a grand statement by electing a third-party
candidate. Neither Humphrey nor Coleman
believed Ventura could win, and I suspect
Minnesotans, even those who voted for him, felt
the same way.

Last year, in high-school government class,
we talked jokingly about Ventura becoming gov-
ernor. Myteacherevenhadacarrdboardcutoutof

THE PITT Nsws: OPINIONS

The ins and outs of starting your own magazine

Rehan Nasir
Columnist

Thank you for ordering our packet on start-
ing your ‘own magazine. Enclosed you will
ﬁnd several helpﬁd documents, mostly legal,
relating to child-labor laws.

The ﬁrst thing you will need is a loca-
tion. Many major magazines are located in
humongous office buildings in even larger
cities. This is not necessarily due to the won-
ders of technology. A small condemned
building will probably suit your needs. Make
sure that it has running water and parking, as
these perks will help lure potential contribu-
tors. Also, you should make the operation as
mobile as possible. This will help to evade
those nasty property .taxes associated with,
well, owning property. These expenses will
hinder business at ﬁrst, especially since the
next thing you’re going to need to buy that
building is capital.

“Capital,” as the kids say, is just another
way of saying, “money for stuff I need to get
this show on the road.” Probably the quick-
est way to accrue capital is to steal money
ﬁom a ﬁnancial institution, such as a large
bank. However, this may lead to other prob-
lems, namely, litigation and time in jail. Of
course, it would be easier to do “an inside
job,” wherein a reliable but bitter family
member whohas been working at the bank
for a long time takes the money for you. It
helps when Auntie Rita is out to get ﬂre bank,

j as this does away with pesky moral issues.

If this does not work out for any reason

can always take a high—school contingent to
a casino. The innocent 18-year—olds will sirn—
ply use their own money (what you will call
the “cost” of the trip), and a percentage (say,
90-percent) of their winnings will go to you.
You can write off the trip as a learning expe-
rience — learning about probability, random
number generators and the effects of large
magnets on various casino games.

So now you’ve got your money and
some decent office space. Now it’s all about

’ getting expensive equipment and Nerf toys

to entertain the masses. Your best bet, again,
is to steal these things. Lounges from hotels
make great places — the quality of the fur-
niture is ﬁrst-rate and it’s usually in impec-
cable condition. Don’t forgetto take the fake
ﬂowers, too — they last a lifetime.

Computers will be the next thing on
your wish list A good rule of corporate theft
— er, borrowing — is that the best mer-
chandise sits around in office lobbies waiting
for the intemal messenger. This includes
expensive computer gadgetry. So since
you’ve got nothing better to do (it’s not like
you have a magazine to run), hang around
your local oﬂice lobby and wait for the
goods to roll in. Remember, the bigger the
building, the bigger the chance of intercept-
ing your means of production. Also, wear a
suit, and cany a leather portfolio sniffed with
papers. You’l1 give the impression of being
someone important waiting for someone
even more important. Then, when the boxes
arrive, use the same van that you used for the
fumiture to haul your ﬁrture home.

OK, so now you have all the stutf.

What’s left are ﬂre people. This way, your
magazine can be run by “people and stuff.”
But where the dickens to ﬁnd creative talent?

If you talk to your ﬁiends, they’ll want
a piece of your glossy paper mint. Since
those weasels are all about money, tl1ey’ll be
perfect for your magazine. Heck, maybe
they can even come up with a theme for your
magazine. Why not the Nok-Hockey Notes
or Ihe.Foosball Follies? Again —— where to
ﬁnd these great minds?

Well, if you don’t have any ﬁiends (and
many people don’t, so quit feeling sorry for
yourself) look in the classiﬁeds. Start with
regular car classiﬁeds. See who’s the most
elegant when it comes to peddling a Buick.

Ifyou hit potential talent, maybe ask for
other work — have they ever tried to sell

lawn equipment? How did those ads ﬂow? If I

that doesn’t work, head for the personals.
Hereis wherecaring talent lurks. Ifthey can
write, “SWM interested in meeting inven-
tivepersontosharedrearns, meals andbus
fare. Need someone to hold my hand when I

ice skate, pick me up when I fall, and lend _

me money when I’rn broke. Experience with
I_.egos is a plus,” then you’ve deﬁnitely got a
section editor waiting to be hired.

All of that should work for your maga-
zine. The people part may be the trickiest.
But heck, if Almtie Rita doesn’t want to
write for you, at least the friends you make in
jail will have the time.

Rehan Nasir doesn’t buy deodorant and
becomes annoyed when the perfume ads in
magazines wear out.

Steven Spielberg's latest films lack imagination

David 0. Madden
' columnist

I’ll be the ﬁrst to admit that I love any
and all inquiries about my major. Call it con-
ceit or whatever you will, but people’s eyes
light up slightly when I say I’m a ﬁlm major.
. What’s better is that most mentions of
my major spawn discussions about movies,
; and tl1ere’s no conversation I enjoy more.
-, Once .everyone’s favorite movie has been
identiﬁed and thoroughly discussed, the
inevitable question of whatil plan on doing
zwhen I get my degree comes.
 “Gonna be the next Steven Spielberg?”
.they ask “Heh  yeah, I hope so!” is always
my reply. It’s the most frequent lie I tell peo-
,ple. No, I actually don’t want to become the

. {next Steven Spielberg, and yes, I realize that

gin choosing not to do so I risk never becom-
;ing the country’s most beloved, powerful
and wealthy ﬁlmmaker. .

, Spielberg, essentially, has it all as a

-director. He makes movies that everyone

‘tloves, and they make a lot of money. My

_-problem wiﬂr Spielberg isn’t that he’s suc-
§§$ESSfll1, nor does.it have anything to do with
his talent, of which I know.he has an over-
whelming amount.
What.Spielberg’ now lacks — ﬁom

what he’s shown with his ﬁlms in the past
decadeorso—is imagination, aqualitythat
brought him to the level of success and inﬂu-
ence he currently holds. His movies no
longer create new -stories for future genera-

tions as they used to, but rather, they retell

stories of which our society has already
developed an understanding.

Spielberg’s early characters, like E.'I‘.
and Indiana Jones, were characters I adored
as achildandusetodaytoconnectwitlrmy
peers. I can safely assume that almost every-
one I meet has seen these movies or at least
knows the characters I’m referring to.
Spielberg’s trips were never boring, and we
adored the ride.

‘ Today, people don’t go to see his ﬁlms
because they want to — they go because

they feel that they should; a Spielberg ﬁlm is

something that “you should see even if you
don’t want to.” “Schindler’s List” and
“Saving Private Ryan” were praised by crit-
ics because of their realistic portrayals of
World War II. '

Don’t people care about characters any-
more? What about the story? Was anyone at

-all interested? “Schindler’s List” was one of

the few movies I’ve seen in along time that
elicited a physical reaction at the end and it
was due to Schindler’s moving speech It

was the culmination of the hero’s relation-
ship with thelews he savedthatbrought on
my emotion, not any realistic violence.

Violence doesn’t bother me, and I
Imderstand its importance in establishing the
tone of a movie. Spielberg’s use of violence
andrealisrn,thoI1gh, is aclear signofwhat
his movies have become. in recent years.
They’re not “violent ﬁlms” or even “action
ﬁlms”; they’re “time machine ﬁlms.” .

“Amistad” wasn’t a story in which peo-
ple wae absorbed and discussed afterward
It was a “tirne-rrnrchine ﬁlm” that gave us a
realisticdepictionofastorywealready
knew. The ﬁlm was over, and so, too, was
our interaction with it. Rather than tell new
stories with new characters, Spielberg now
feels more comfortable as the cinematic his-
torianofourera.Hemakesamovielike
“Amistad” and, has a mood established
before he shoots a single scene.

Likewise, a ﬁlm about the Holocaust
already has the audience’s collective feeling
ofangertowardNazi Germanybuiltinto the
narrative. Spielbag’s ﬁlms attach them-
selves to a collective spirit that has been
established well before he even began mak-
 ﬁlms. His movies today are nothing
morethanthestoriesofliistorytoldﬂneugh

L

- gusting sounds‘ of saliva.

we get an “original” story only in the sense

that we don’t know what this character is .

going to do, but we sure as hell know how
we’ll feel about it.

A movie should create a world that an
audience can be a part of: a new world with
new characters where we’re not sure what’s
going to happen. The true challenge of ﬁlm-
making is creating a truth of the ﬁlm’s own
that the audience can believe for two hours.
Spielberg, who was once a master of creat-
ing his own worlds, now only reproduces the
ones we already know with cinematic excess
and passes them oil’ as “imaginative.”

There was a time that Spielberg rrrade
family ﬁlms — truly imaginative ones like
“Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “E.
T.” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” but those
were in a dilferent decade. Perhaps he’s
latched onto what gets him critical acclaim in
the ‘90s; “Hook” bombed, and “Schindler’s
List” won Oscars. Whatever he’s doing, he’s
lost sight of the real magic that movies can
create.

This is a column not about sports, but
rather the hypocrisy that I see by those fans
who lack a thing called loyalty. Allow me to
illustrate what I mean.

Speciﬁcally, I will discuss our very own
Pitt Panthers. It is no secret that the Panthers
are not having their best season this year. To
be honest, they’re struggling. Do you want to
know what the sad part is? The fair—weather
fans who only cheer for the team when it’s
having a good season. Ihear it all the time on
the shuttles or before classes — people blast-
ing the Panthers. They say things such as,
“Coach Hanis is just a younger Johnny

have had this opportunity. so let me enlight-
en you on the price players pay for this.
First, there is no off-season. After the
regular season is done, the Panthers will go
right into winter training, where they will be
at the mercy of one Buddy Monis, the
team’s strength coach. The best way I could
describe him is as a mixture of a demanding
drill sergeant, a ru1er—vvielding mother and a
prison warden. He demands nothing but the
best and total effort from everyone from the
All-America scholarship players to the walk-
ons. The players come early in the morning
torunandnmandrtm.Thentherealwork
begins: conditioning, weight training, calis—
thenics, more nmning, agility exercises and
so on. This all before breakfast and classes.
T'hat’s just for the so—called “off-season.”

cl Ioreul Panther loyalty?

During the season, the same sacriﬁces are
made. If it’s true that the harder you work,
the harder it is to surrender  I see no sur-
render in the Panthers.

let me ask you another question: What
did you do over the summer break? A lot of
you went on vacation, some of you went
home to work, and some of you took class-
es. The Panthers were here working, train-
ing, sacriﬁcing a hell of a lot to bring them-
selves to a higher level. I hope you’re getting
the point that the players don’t just throw on
a uniform on Saturdays and go on the ﬁeld
and just play. They’ve given a lot for this
school, the program and the fans, and any-
one who hasn’t done the same will never
appreciate it. Remember that when you
“sunshine fans” feel like making more jokes
if the Panthers have another cloudy day this
season. _

The ﬁmniest thing I hear is when Mr. 99
superfan talks big about how he can turn the
team around  that is, if he played. Furmy
how he always ﬁnds some excuse why he
can’t: jobs, classes, whatever. The real rea-
son is he doesn’t have the guts to play. He’s
a big talker, but when it comes down to it,
that’s all he is — talk Hey, if Mr. 99 super-
fan is out there reading this and he really
thinks that he can make a positive inﬂuence
on the program and he has the brass to go
through Buddy’s program, then after this
season he should go down to the stadium,
stand and be counted. If not, then he should
shut the hell up and let the real men do what
they. do. The brave are always the ﬁrst to go.

You may ask why these guys go
through all this for a game. You obviously
never played football. Sure, some may get a
shot to play in the NFL, but that’s not what

drives most of these guys. It’s the love of the i '

game. Football is a sport unlike any other.
You put your well-being in the hands of your
teammates, and they do the same with you.
It’s 11 gladiators in a poetic dance, ﬁghting
for a common goal. Football is not just 22
guys busting heads and nmning into each
other. It’s a beautiful thing to watch and a
better thing to be a part of. They play for the
love of the game, and that’s enough. It is

‘ essential to understand that the battles are

primarily won in the hearts of men.

I end with this thought: It is not the crit-
ic who cotmts, not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles or where the
doer of deeds could have done them better.
The credit belongs to the man who is actual-
ly in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood, who errs and comes
short again and again, who knows the great
enthusiasrns and the great devotions, who
spends himself in a worthy cause, who — at
best —— knows in the end the triumph of high
achievement, and «who — at worst, if he fails
——atleastfails whiledaringgreatlysothat
his place shall never be with those cold and
timid souls who know neither victory or
defeat. Go Panthers, and thank you.

‘ Tony Oliva asks that even the “sunshine

fans” stand and be counted on Saturday at
the Pitt-Boston College game.

 

Yander: no
more Pitt games
for me

When it came down to deciding
where to attend college five years
ago, I considered the usual: acade-
mic reputation, faculty doctorates
and graduation rates. But the final
factor that swayed my decision was
whether the school had a Division I
athletics program. I know it wasn’t
the best process to use, but I have
my priorities. '

After choosing Pitt, I was so.

excited at the thought of attending
major college football and basket-
ball games. I vowed never to miss a
game, and I didn’t for the first four
years. *

This year, I didn’t ‘purchase
football season tickets, and I
haven’t attended a game yet this
year. I’m not buying basketball sea-
son tickets, either, nor do I plan on
attending_any of the hoops games
this year. —

,Why, you may ask? Apathy?
Too busy? Neither. I’m fed up with
the two Panther squads. I have
given them four years of\my life,
and for what? Heartache and

headaches.
Sure, the Panthers went to the
Liberty Bowl last season.

Congratulations, boys, for going to
one of 57 postseason bowl games in
the country. That doesn’t even
include the newest bowl game: the
Steamtown Bowl sponsored by
Boscov’s department store in beau-
tiful Scranton, Pa. I

This bowl allows some teams
that fail to accumulate six wins
during the season to participate in
the contest. So here’s a tip to our
boys of‘ ‘thegridiron: Don’t win
another game. I know it’ll be hard,
but - .
just keep up what you’ve been
doing, and I think you can accom-
plish the goal..I still have a little
faith in you (or is that yinz?). I can
see the Lackawanna County Multi-
Purpose Stadium in our sights. I
just hope Temple isn’t the other
invite. I ,

As for the basketball team, I
have just as much displeasure with
you. It’s been simple. Four years.
No postseason tournament. The
NIT in 1997 doesn’t count. It hasn’t
mattered since the inception of the
NCAA version in 1939. You did

Something finally has A _to give
when the Boston College Eagles
meet the Panthers at Pitt Stadium on
Saturday. -

Like the now-struggling
Panthers, who have lost their last
four games, the Eagles showed
promise earlier in the season. Boston
College opened its season with three
impressive victories but has since
lost six consecutive games, earning a
record of 3-6 (2-3 in the Big East)
heading into Saturday’s game.

The latest loss was an especially
difficult one to take. Notre Dame vis-
ited Chestnut Hill last Saturday. That
usually means an exciting game, and
this year’s game was no‘ exception.
The Fighting Irish stopped the
Eagles’ final drive inches short of the
goal line as time expired to hold on
to a’ 31-26 win.

The Eagles’ strength is their
offense, led by record-setting senior
running back Mike Cloud. Cloud’s
numbers have fallen off slightly from
the Heisman—esque performanceshe
put up in the first three games, but he
is still one of the nation’s premier
running backs. ’

fourth in the country.’ If he hits that
average against_the Panthers, Cloud
will break the Big East single—season
rushing record of 1505 yards, set last
year by Amos Zereoue of West
Virginia. Cloud has been held under
100 yards rushing in a game just
once this season, by Miami two
weeks ago. With all those yards come
touchdowns. Cloud has more rushing

“I was pleased allthe way around. It
was a pretty good game,”. ﬁrst—year head
coach Traci Waites said. .

Pitt was paced by 6-foot-7-inch cen-

game with 14 points and seven rebounds.

height advantage to dump the ball into her
on almost every play.

“The inside was allowed, so that’s
what we took,” Waites said. ‘

Pitt’s big run. It pulled back into con-

Eva Vanova did most of the work for

Both teams played a very physical
game, but no player felt it more than
Vanova, who stopped play to show the
referee small wounds she received while
battling the Lady Panthers’ scrappy
guards. -

Picks for this week with six undefeated teams in action

After an exciting weekend of
football, I was left gasping for air,
as my record during my picks tenure
has fallen to 6-6. I wouldn’t mind
missing every game, though, if
games proved to be that exciting
every week.

This week sees six teams still
unbeaten, and two of those teams
will go head to head. “Conference
matchups” are the key words this
weekend, as each game I’ll predict
has them, including Pitt and Boston
College. But the main attractions
will be thebattle of the unbeatens,
Tennessee vs. Arkansas, and another
key game that will put unbeaten
Wisconsin against Michigan. For
thatgame, we have a prediction
from former Pitt and Tennessee
football coach Johnny Majors.

Guest pick of the week by Johnny
Majors:
Wisconsin (+3 1/2) at Michigan
“Interestingly, both teams are in
a game in which they are moving in
a positive direction. Wisconsin is
very ambitious and confident.
Michigan had a high against Penn
State last week, and it’s verytough
to have a high two weeks in a row.
This is an opportunity that
Wisconsin won’t have often, and I
think [it is] due for a win over
Michigan. There comes a time when
a team just makes things happen.”
Wisconsin _20, Michigan 13

Northwestern (+24) at Penn State

It’s hard to believe that the
Northwestern Wildcats are only two
years removed from the Rose Bowl.
Northwestern is only 2-8 overall and
0-7 in the Big Ten, while the Nittany
Lions are having another fine season
at 6-2. Penn State’s problems have
come with the big boys in the con-
ference, while it’s easily picked
apart the lesser teams. They’ll do
the same this week-with a steady
running attack and a smothering
defensive effort.

Penn State 42, Northwestern 17

Boston College (-1) at Pitt

This game pits two teams wal-
lowing in despair. The Panthers
have lost four straight to take com-
mand of the Big East basement,
while the Eagles have dropped six in
a row, including last week’s heart-
breaker to Notre Dame. Both teams
are much better than 
their records, and the
miniscule point spread
shows that they are
equal. Boston College
will give Pitt a heavy
dose of Mike Cloud, the
Big East’s leading rush— ._ ‘
er, -and occasionally ~-

will look to strike deep against the
A suspect Panther defensive secondary

through the use of quarterback Scott
Mutryn and wide receiver Anthony
Dicosmo. Pitt will counter with its
newfound running attack led by
Brandon Williams and an always
exciting core of receivers in Terry
Murphy and Latef Grim. This game
will come down to two simple
things: special teams and turnovers.
Pitt will win these battles and win
the game in a squeaker.

Pitt 27, Boston College 24

Virginia Tech (+4 1/2) at Syracuse

This is a huge matchup in the
Big East, as each of these teams has
a conference loss, and another could
be deadly. This game is especially
huge since Miami is supposed to
take care of the Temple Owls and
remain in contention for the Big
East title. Syracuse will once again
rely on the play-making abilities of
Donovan McNabb. He will do it
himself and distribute to the running
backs and wide receivers when pos-
sible. I say “when possible” because
the Hokies enter the game with the
fifth-ranked defense nationally, only
giving up 8.9 points per game. They
can shut down the best of them,
unlike Syrac.use’s defense, which

  

No.

has not proved to be a threat to any-
one. That’s the difference in the
game, as the Hokies will get a big
game out of their ground attack to
beat the Orangemen in the Carrier
Dome. Also look for the Hokies’
special teams to either score or pro-
duce a score when they’re in the
game.
Virginia Tech 26, Syracuse 21
Arkansas (+10) at
Tennessee
This is the first time
since l97l that two
undefeated’
teams meet this late in
the season. Tennessee
enters the game ranked
1 for the first in quite some
time, and that could be some added
pressure for the Volunteers. One
thing that Arkansas has been good at
has been handling pressure. It seems
each week the Razorbacks are
expected to fall apart, but they man-
age to hold it together and pull out
wins against quality opponents.
Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin
has also handled pressure well, suc-
cessfully replacing Peyton Manning
and even leading the Vols to a win
over the Florida Gators. Playing in
Knoxville will help Tennessee,
which will ‘manage to break away in
the fourth quarter.
Tennessee 31, Arkansas 17

 

Nebraska (+10) at Kansas State

I can’t remember the last time
the Nebraska Cornhuskers were not
favored to win a football game. That
just shows how good this,Kansas
State Wildcats team is. The Wildcats
finally get the big game at home,
and to top it off, the Cornhuskers
have been less than impressive in
already losing two games. An 8-2
record is nothing to be ashamed of,
and this Nebraska team still has a lot
of pride and talent. Unfortunately, it
appears that Kansas State has the
better talent this year, possessing

the top—ranked total defense and

yielding only 69 points this year.
Michael Bishop is not too bad at the
quarterback position and is even
mentioned as a Heisman Trophy
candidate. He’ll be the difference in
this game, keeping the Nebraska
defense off balance for most of the
day. Kansas State continues to storm
to a national title game.

Air Force (-4) at Wyoming .

A couple of ranked WAC teams
battle it out this weekend in a game
that will most likely decide the
Mountain Division champion. The
Cowboys lived up to my billing last
week and knocked off Colorado
State on the road. This week,
they’re at home and will need to
stop a surprising run-oriented Air
Force team that also possesses a
quality quarterback in Blane
Morgan. The Cowboys also have a
good quarterback in Jay Stoner who
will once again be the hero for
Wyoming.

Lock of the Week .
West Virginia (+20 1/2) at Rutgers
The Mountaineers put them-
selves back on the map last week by
knocking off Syracuse and inching
toward the top 25 again. Meanwhile,
Rutgers, which has quietly moved to
a 5-4 record and one win in the last
two games, could possible put the
Scarlet Knights in bowl game, but
they will most likely need to beat
Virginia Tech, too. Mike McMahon
has had an impressive season, but he
won’t outshine West Virginia’s Marc
Bulger, who has had a solid season
himself. Unlike Pitt, -West Virginia
will. run often, thanks to Amos
Zereoue who is seventh in the coun-
try in running. The Mountaineers
won’t cover the spread but will
come darn close.

From priests to Boston College Eagles 30 

Jay Yander
Staff Writer

Boston College received advice
from the man upstairs when it came
time to choosing a nickname. Well,
almost.

Actually, the university got the
idea for the eagle as its nickname from
the Rev. Edward McLaughlin, after a
Boston newspaper cartoon depicted
the champion BC track team as a cat
licking clean a plate of its rivals.

McLaughlin didn’t agree with the
cartoon portrayal of the school and
suggested the feathered friend as the
animal to represent the school.

“It is important that we adopt a
mascot to preside at our powwows and
triumphant feats,” said McLaughlin.
“And why not the eagle, symbolic of
majesty, power and freedom?”

The same year the eagle was
adopted as the mascot and nickname,
BC received gifts from Texas and New
Mexico. Two live mascots were sent
to Chestnut Hill, but neither bird was

;..;....u...A.-.m....¢u....-.....;....a.4... usu-A_u.u4.ou4«u..uA.

 

fond of its new home — one escaped,
and the other injured its beak trying to
escape.

During the next 40 years, the only
mascot that graced the BC campus
was the stuffed and mounted golden
eagle that was placed in the athletics

 

 

department offices.

In 1961, a group of students peti-
tioned for a search of live Aquila
chrysaetos (eagles) to represent the
university.

The new eagle was named Margo,

 

a combination of the first letters of the
school colors - maroon and gold. The
l0—pound, 2-month-old female golden
eagle was given to BC by a Colorado
man in August I961.

Margo lived at the Franklin Park
Zoo and attended every BC home
football game for five years, even
traveling with the squad to such away
contests as Army, Holy Cross and
Syracuse. She died in I966 after suf-
fering fromta virus just before the
Navy game.

The ‘university went to the more
conventional method of representing

the school by utilizing a costumed

human .m,ascot._-shortly after Margo’s
death. ‘"
Boston College’s colors were cho-

sen a bit earlier than the mascot. ‘In the.

mid-18805, the students proclaimed
they needed colors to wear in order to
cheer on their team.

Shortly after, the Jesuit institution
chose maroon and gold -— two of the
many Papal colors —— as the official
school colors.

senior quarterback Scott Mutryn,
who, thanks in part to good protec-
tion, ranks second in the conference
in passing efficiency. His favorite
target is senior wide receiver
Anthony DiCosmo, who had a huge
game against Notre Dame last week.
DiCosmo has emerged as an impor-
tant big-play threat for the Eagles,
averaging nearly 18 yards per catch.

The Eagles’ weakness is their
defensive unit, which ranks in the
middle of the pack in a conference
not known for its defense. The
defensive line is anchored by nose
guard Chris Hovan, who was an All-

Big East selection last season and _

has been a consistent performer this
season, as well. He leads the team in
tackles with 74 and wreaked havoc
on Notre Dame last week, register-
ing two sacks and forcing two fum-
bles. ,

In addition to Hovan, the
Panthers will have to keep an eye on
junior safety Pedro Cirino and senior
linebacker Brian Maye, both of
whom re-entered the Eagles’ starting
lineup last week after missing games
due to injuries.

The game was originally sched-
uled to kick off at 3:30 p.m. on
Saturday, but the time has been
changed to noon to accommodate

defeat a very, very talented New
Orleans squad, though. A hearty
congratulations indeed!

I know coach Ralph Willard
would like to use untimely injuries
as an excuse for the basketball
problems in the past four years.
Willard came to Pitt about the same
time I agreed to attend. I viewed
Ralphy boy as the savior to take us
to the “big dance.”‘The only dance
we’ve been to is the hospital ball. I
haven’t seen so many ailments
since I saw “Saving Private Ryan”

I last week.

Have any of you boys ever
heard of Cal Ripken? This guy
played in 2,632 consecutive games.
He played with pain —— period. He
probably would have played with a
knife in his chest.

I realize some of you have had

legitimate injuries over the years.‘

and don’t want to jeopardize your
careers, but really, are you going to
have to worry about a limp when
you’re pushing papers at Fritz’s
Temporary Employment?

Instead of worrying about a pro-
fessional basketball career, worry
about the state of the Panther bas-
ketball program (bottom line: you
will not be an NBA player because
if Jerry McCullough wasn’t drafted,
neither will any of you.) There was
a time when Pitt basketball was
respected. It’s just too bad it was a
decade ago. My advice to you is to
play with that hangnail of yours,
and, for God’s sake, box out!

Jay Yander is a columnist for The
Pitt News and regrets he didn’t
chose Florida State as his mother
and father wanted him to. At- least

he would have been a part ofafoot- '

ball national championship and
witnessed Bobby Sam at the college
level.

the rest of the night, but Slovakia never
came closer than 17 points.

The Lady Panthers could have had an
even bigger lead if it were not for all of
their missed layups and short shots.

“Missed layups are from a lack of
concentration, but we will work on that,”
Waites said.

The Lady Panthers started the game
in a zone, but less than a minute later, they
switched to a man defense, which they
used for most of the game. Waites said it
was a move made for “intensity.”

The move worked; Pitt showed
intensity and determination the rest of the

night.

Guards Michelle Katkowski,
Monique Toney, LaTonya Blanton and
LaTonya Lawrence hustled all over the
ﬂoor, diving and rolling for loose balls all
night. E

Waites is an intense coach by her
own admission, and she showed that on
the ﬂoor.

“I am intense. I don’t ever want to
relax because I don’t want the players to
relax,” Waites said. '

Katkowski and Blanton got that mes-
sage when they were pulled from the
game in the first minute.

The Lady Panthers return to action
Saturday night at 6 pm. in the opening
round of the Pittsburgh Panther
Invitational against Robert Morris.
