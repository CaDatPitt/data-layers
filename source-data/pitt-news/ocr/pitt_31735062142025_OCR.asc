Icardi,   Wilde Deadlock

Volume 33, Number 77

’ By IRWIN ROSEN

Neither Aldo Icardi nor Gus
Wilde ‘was named president of SFA
last Wednesday night, as, after two
straight-party tie votings, the boys
decided to call it quits and go home
for the evening.

Only one piece of business before
the new assembly, the selectionof
the executive committee (arrang-
ed long beforehand) passed—every
other question put before the body
resulted in attic, the 16 fraternity
members Voting as a body, and the

16 Independents voting together. .

I The new executive committee is
Wilde, Icardi, Ed Tablac, Bill Clem-
mer, Esther Berland and Betty
Toohill-—three fraternity members
and three Independents.

Following SFA procedure, the
executive committee nominated
candidates for offices within the as-
sembly — Icardi

president;
secretary; and Tablac, unopposed,
for treas_urer.

Clemmer was nominated 7for
treasurer, but declined to run. One
member of executive committee
hinted that .Clemmer’s refusal to
run for SFA treasurer came be-
cause he would rather be SFA’s
representative” to the "executive
committee of the Pitt‘ News.

The first deadlock of the eve-
ning followed. It came when an
Independent, declaring that “since
Wildeand Icardi were so closely

' matched,” moved that both can-
didates‘ leave the room while the
group discussed their qualiﬁca-
tions. The fraternity group, at
least two of whom were already
late for aformal dance, apparent-
ly anxious to get the voting over
with as little discussion as possible,
voted against the motion--straight
down the line. Believing, evidently,
that an open discussion on the
merits of the two candidates would
aid Icardi, Independents put their
full strength behind the motion.‘
The result was 16 to 16.
And so there was a discussion,

Sones Ac/viser to$uperman Comics

By }{ARRIE’I‘T BAUER

“A yearly "circulation of 15,000,000 copies was

what attiactecl my attentionto pictorial magazines,”
said W. W. D. Sones, Professor of Education. He
added, “Anything with that appeal must have some-
thing to be investigated by a person interested in

education.”

Dr Sones was recently asked by a publisher of
“Superman” to be the educational consultant for
that comic book. In that position he gives counsel
as to how the magazine can be used for educational

   
    
  
 

tn preserve the adventure.

purposes. Dr. Sones suggests material that will make
the adventures of “Superman.” more educational and

e*iiu4eati.ona1 implications of thesessbooks led

Those most’ interested in the magazines are chil-
dren between the ages of nine and fourteen. I

In individualizing instruction, the comic book has
extraordinary possibilities for discriminating between
children who are slow-‘readers and those who are
merely disinterested. I '

These children, through comic books and other
pictorial magazines, have been found to be deﬁnite-
ly aided, forthey have shown an increase in vocabu-
lary as well as a better understanding o-f geography,
history, science and other subjects most frequently
dealt with in comic books. Needless to say, the vivid
adventures of comic book heroes quickly arouses the
interest of the disinterested child.

s It is Dr. Sones’ theory that reading the adventures

Frankly we aren’t a bit nostalgic.
This is the last editorial we’ll ever write for the

~ ‘Pitt News. But we’re still not nostalgic.

In fact we're rather happy about the whole
thing.

By the whole thing we mean the Pitt News, the
printers—both of them, God bless ’em——, the-al'-
night extras, the friendly rivalry with the busi-
ness staff, the hell that the election extra raised,
and the knives in the back we got when many of
our superﬁcial friends saw it.

We're not so happy about the fraternity politics
that were pulled last Wednesday. We think that
Fraternity leaders are plain stupid to think that
they can dominate SFA anymore We think that
the faculty members who were afraid to vote last
Wednesday had better make up theirfminds wh eth-
er they‘ want a Student-Faculty association or

,whether they want a Fraternity-Independent as-

sociation. Men who are afraid to vote certainly
aren't much good in a student government assem-

. ' blage. -

V If nobody in SFA wants student government,
if, for example, fraternity members want SFA to
continue to be nothing but a clearing house for
fraternity patronage, then abolish it. It's doing
:nobody any good, and it's ruining the concept of
self-government at the University.
' If a man’s fraternity comes before his Univer-
sity, then perhaps it’s time to take away his right
to participate in the University. 01- perhaps it’s

Farewell From An Editor-

time to take away privileges which place him in
a situation which gives him such a choice.
Student government at Pitt has no place for fra-
ternity or independent politics. Who’s the best man
for the job? That’s the point. And if the faculty
is supposed to be represented, a.nd if the faculty
is going to cast the decisive vote, then let them be
represented by men who are not afraid to vote on
what they believe to be true and honest and good
for student government.
t * ‘=3
The reason we don't feel nostalgic is because we
look to the future of the University.
And the future of the University can be great.
Pittsburgh is one of the greatest, broadest,

‘ grandest most powerful, strongest cities in the

World.
And Pittsburgh needs a University to express
its great aspirations and its great future.

There is no other school in Pittsburgh that has
the qualiﬁcations, the broad scope, the ﬁrm
foundation that the University of Pittsburgh has.

But to become a great University, Pitt must
change. Perhaps it must change rapidly
We don't pretend to know exactly how the Uni-

versity must change. But we do.know that this -

war will change the economic basis of world so-
ciety. We do know that the cultures of the world
will flow together more rapidly than ever before.
We do know that social. man will come before in-
dividualist man. And we do know that past ways

de Beneciictis Says
A/Axclieu, Sheds No Tears

of thought must be abandoned.

The University has made a start in the right
direction. We managed to prepare for the future
with teachers like Oliver Reiser, Carroll Amund-
son, John W. Oliver, Harold Schoenberger, Carl
Stotz, Auleene Jamison, and J. Stanley Gray.

And we wished there were many more men on
the faculty who could be as broadminded and in-
telligent and as fair as these. There are, of course,
and it is from among these men and among such
men of good will all through the University that
the spark for a great University must come.

For the breadth, and width and depth of a uni-
versity faculty are the measurements of that uni-
versity itself.

We look toward a powerful University Senate
and towards a rejuvenated chapter of the Ameri-
can Association of University Professors to aid
in the increase of this measurement.

Students may stimulate .the growth of the Uni-
versity by living for, by and with the University,
and by seeking their responsibilities and accept-
ing them. -

Students must participate, must take an ever
increasing part in building the University into a
great university.

We hope we have done our part. We know we
could have done more. We leave our successor .t he
honor and privilege of editing the Pitt News and
of taking his part in helping the University grow.

 Vitamin D is especially import-

and of pregnant or nursing women
-because the bone and tooth build-

This vitamin aids in depositing
calcium and phosphorus in bones

rest of tooth decay among grow-

I .“To say that India would submit

the United Press in India, asex-
pressed in a talk given before a

_- group of political science students

Mr. Raman supported his opin-
ion by declaring that the people of
India, whom he talked to less than
a month ago, want to defeat the
Japanese. In fact, 50,000 volun-
teers are added to the army each
month and already India has a
.- standing army of one million train-

 ed men. Lack of equipment is the

--only reason it is not larger.

I r aAs for the people of India being

intelligent, Mr. Raman stated that

although 80 per cent of the popu-

lation cannot write it does not mean
sthat they cannot think. As a matter
 fact’, they think shrewdly and
surely. I

 When discussing the recent pro-
ilfosal which was rejected by the

   

plfpolitical leaders of India, the short

that it was not because the propos-

Parnes Outlines
Payment Plan

For War Bills

By ALLEN ABRAMSON

War bills that are being passed
to ﬁnance the war will not be sad-
dled upon the next generation, but
instead willbe paid now.

Herbert Parnes, ‘graduate’ stu-
dent‘ assistant in economics, pro-
ponent. of this idea, explains it _in
terms of the good affected. We are
paying for the war at present by
giving up autos, sugar, and refrig-
erators, while the next generation
will have all these goods.

A shift in purchasing power,
however, will be caused when the
time comes fo-r the government to
pay off its debts. The taxes that
are collected then will be imme-
diately handed -out to those who
own government bonds.

Parnes believes the danger in
these huge debts, then, lies not in
the fact that there will be huge
taxes, collected, since the money
will be returned to the public, but
in the fact that these sums will be
shifted in the consumers’ pockets.

At present, the problem of the
government is to draw off the
greatly increased purchasing pow-
er of the public because of the
scarcity of consumer goods in or-
der to prevent inflation.

After the war, Mr. Parnes ex-
plains, the government will be fac-
ed with the problem of minimizing
the eﬁects of the great change of
wealth from one portion of the pub-_
lie to another.

Tie...

meeting itself were the political
machinations that took place Wed-
nesday afternoon.

Key man in the maneuvering was -

Phi‘ Epsilon Pi’s Alex Zelenski,
sports editor of the Pitt News.
Feeling that he had been.,cut out
by fraternity inner'circles, because
he was not offered a seat on ex-
ecutive committee and because the
Phi Eps and their political cohorts
the Delts were slighted in this
year's fraternity slating, Zelenski
was all set to lead a Fraternity
swing-over to the Independents.

At a caucus in the Panther 01’-
ﬁce Wednesday afternoon, frater-
nity lcaders contacted Zelenski,
argued, threatened complete shut-
off of inter--fraternity patronage
to his house if Zelenski suported
Icardi. They threatened to make
things in inter-fraternity council
difficult for l)elt Dick Griffith who
is president of the group.

They ‘offered Zelenski the chair-
manship of appointments commit-
tee, as a paciﬁer for returning to
the fraternity fold.

And Zelenski, in the interest of
the political future of his frater-
nity, was forced back into line,
ending what might have been the
start of a fraternity-independent
combine, breaking down the tra-
ditional, unsuccessful fraternity-

The portable Red Cross blood
unit, literally swamped with ap-
plicants, completed its three-day
stay at the University Wednesday
with a line of volunteers waiting to
take the place of anyone who fail-
ed to appear.

Many of these volunteers were
turned away because the unit could
serve only 80 persons in a four
hour period, according to Dr. Ca-
buzzi, in charge of the unit.

He said that he was “well satis-
ﬁed with the turn-out and the spirit
of Pitt students.”

Because many students that
could not be accommodated but had
ﬁlled out applications, the unit may
be sent to Pitt again, probably
next week. ‘

It was _not known how many
pints of blood taken from the 80

‘The new plan calls for enlist-
ment of University students as pri-

cation on a deferred service basis
until actually required for Army

Student enlistees in the Enlisted

active duty at any time, but the
plan defers them permitting fur-

they maintain satisfactory scholas-

able for use, but the unit used 68
pints of blood Monday. and 77
pints Tuesday.

Many of the students who applied
had to be rejected because they
were under 21 and had neglected to
obtain the signatures of their par-
ents. Those who signed the forms
at the blood station were told to

to go to donate their blood.

The staff, composed of a doctor,
four nurses, two orderlies and sev-

organized to operate the portable
unit. This was tieir first trip to
collect blood which will be dried
and stored for use in the armed
services.

Elevator Operator Tells
All For Safctyis Sake

By VIOLA BOYDJIEFF

Neurotic elevators may now be
added to the long list of the Uni-
versity’s unusual features.

Pitt’s up and down transporta-
tion system can be as calm or tem-

peramental as the passengers, ac-
cording to Fred Bender, night
school student in the College, who
runs one of the eight University
elevators. One, for instance, ap-
proaches each stop best when there
are eight people in it. Others per-
form well with different speciﬁed
numbers of passengers.

Fred, who is interested in gov-
ernment service, has found sever-
al precautions to offer if riders
want to get the most satisfactory
service possible. '

When running for an elevator.
he warns, you should head down
the center of the corridor and don”:
hug the wall. The operator thus has
a better chance to see you coming,
and there is less danger of’ acci-
dents. ‘

“ .ven though I can see about
four—fifths of the .-‘pace outside in
the mirror or the reflection in the
opposite black, _shiny doors,”
Fred declared, “it is better to call
‘Up’ or ‘Down’ to be sure 1 wait.”

Another precaution is not to
dash out the door of the car with-
out first indicating that you are
Eeaving. If the door is already clos-
ing, the operator may not be able
to stop it in time. And for speedier
service during the rush hours, it
is best to go to the ground floor
instead of the ﬁrst for an “Up”
car.

-For those who wonder what
would happen if the elevator ca-
bles should break: small cleats are
‘ tornaticallyv h t out byithe gov-

    

will stop the car. On the bottom
of the shaft is a hydraulic jack also
used for the same purpose.
Additional safety factors are the
collapsible gate and the black slid-
ing doors which, when open, also
stop the car, as well as six cables
on the locals and eight on the ex-
press cars.

As for the lighter moments of
operating an elevator, Fred sug-
gests that the girl who left her
garter clasp in his elevator about
a month ago, come back and claim
it.

It’s losing its snap.

Defense   Needs
Hit‘ University
'Col<e’ I‘\ddicts

The defense program has hit the
Tuck shop. .

At different times during the day
you may go up to the counter and
see the familiar “No Coca Cola”
sign. Or you may have to drink
your coffee with just one lump of
sugar. And perhaps they do not
have your favorite candy bar.

Because of the nation-wide need
for sugar, the Tuck shops are now
allowed only 60 per cent of their
former monthly supply, while the
sale of certain chocolate candies
has been stopped for the duration.

“Many students do not drink
anything when they cannot get
cokes," remarked Mrs. Anna Mur-
phy, hostess to the faculty club,
“Others drink queer concoctions of

 Dr. E.  Jacobsen Studies Voodooism
While Teaching Education at Pitt  in

Room 2717 Cathedral is a long
way from Haiti. And there is a
long step between the job as inves-
tigator of voodooism in Haiti and
the position of Dean of the School
of Education in the University of
Pittsburgh.

Dr. Einar W. Jacobsen, who also
teaches education, has taken that
long step. _

As a captain in the Marine
Corps during World War I, Dr.
Jacobsen, served in the native re-
public where his first assignment
was to investigate voodooism,

$10,000 Mai

religion originating in Africa.

Voodooism has .a tremendous hold
on the natives of Haiti, he soon dis-
covered. The high priests and
priestesseseasily control the lives
of the members of the tribe by
curses and spells.‘

The resurrected “_Zombie” of the

tribe is, Dr. J acobsen explains, just
a tribesman who has been drugged
by the priests until he is believed
dead by his people. Later he is
;“brought back to _life” by the
priests, but he never fully recovers
his normal faculties; he walks in

k Passed

ln Battleship Campaign

Ending the thirteenth week of
the campaign, the ‘battleship drive
passed the $10,000 sales mark Wed-
nesday through the efforts of the
Beta Sigma Omicron women whose
sales of $319 in stamps and bonds
boosted the total up to $10,086.

Highest sales of the day among
the white-jacketed fraternity sales-
Women were credited to Bertha De-
lopitro, Ed43, who distribute_d 134
stamps. Altogether the stamp sales
netted $244 and the bonds $75.

The battleship committee be-
lieves that the §l0,000 mark is
the highest attained among the
colleges and universities through-
out the country. Only four more
weeks are left before the drive
closes for this semester, but, if
possible, it will be extended into
the summer months.

While the proceeds of the cam-
paign steadily mount, the United
States battleship, the Iowa, which
symbolizes the local drive, is pro-
gressing in its construction, though
government sources will not reveal
any details which might aid the
enemy. .

Although the stamp and bond
proceeds are turned over to the
Treasury, the use of the lowa as
a deﬁnite goal makes the buying of
stamps and bonds" a more personal
issue to students and faculty mem-
‘bers. Student cooperation in buy-
ing stamps has been increased up
to date, ‘and last Wednesday was
the first time that a new record in
sales was not established.

Next Wednesday, the women of
Alpha Epsilon Phi fraternity will
be in charge of the sales.

Pitt Men Want  
Aviation Books

Pitt men are reading with a pur-
pose. ‘J
At ‘least, that is the idea one
gets after talking to Mrs. ‘Dice,
librarian in the Alldred room, who
said that there has been a decided-
ly stronger demand for books about
aviation since December 7. g
This attitude is surprising when
books like Perry's “On -All
Fronts,” Shirer’s “Berlin Diary,”
and Caldwell's _“All Out on the
Road to Smolensk” are on the
Alldred room bookshelf. These
books are in demand in other li-
braries throughout the nation.
For those students who want re-
laxation from the current warnews
but who still want to read up to
date = novels, Mrs. Dice suggests
the following books: “The Moon is
Down” by Steinbeck, “Keys, of the
Kingdom” by Cronin, “Sam Small
Flies Again” by Knight, and Burt’s
“Along These Streets.”

will be at the end posts; Joe Salv-
ucci and Jack Durishan, tackles;
Bill Dillon and Vince Antonelli at
the guards and George Allshouse
at center.

However, should Sotak not be
in condition to play due to an in-
jury sustaincd in last week’s in-
tra-squad game, Norman Gestner,
who played a very good» game last
week, will team up with Clowes
at the teiminals.

Bowser’s backﬁeld will be com-
posed of Walter West at the sig-
nal calling position. Bill Dutton and
Jackie Stetler, balfbaclcs and Frank
Saltsa at the plunging post. In the
game last week Saksa scored the
only touchdown of the day as he
plunged over from the three yard

line.

While the intra—squad games
show Bowser what he has to work
with for the coming season, the
game this Saturday, against real
competition, will really give the
coaching staﬁ a chance to see the
good poﬁits and weaknesses of the
team. -

Following the engagement on

Saturday with West Virginia the
Panthers will have another week
of spring drills and then will hang
up their cleats until next fall when
they  once again take to the
practice ﬁeld to get ready for the
opening contest with Minnesota.

By ELAINE KAHN
Pitt baseball moves into one of
its heaviest weeks on Saturday
when they face the usual strong
Indiana State Teachers team. The
schedule makers have shown little
mercy for Coach Ralph Mitterling
and his nine, for following the In-
diana game the Panthers will meet
West Virginia in games at the Sta-
dium on Monday and Tuesday.
Once aagin the choice of a
pitcher for the game on Saturday
lies between Carmella Ranii, Bill
McKee, and Joe Wilk. Coach Mit-
terling's choice will be further
complicated by the fact that he
must also have pitchers ready for
the‘ Monday and Tuesday games.
In Saturday's tilt with Bucknell,
which the Panthers lost 8-6, all
three of his starters were used.
At present the Pitt mound staff
numbers nine players. In addition
to Ranii, Wilk, and McKee, there

are Ed Vitunac, Paul Palanzo, Paul

Cherciari, Bill Ritenbaugh, Joe
Hohos, and Steve Shuber. All, with
the exception of Cherciariwho is
a. senior and basketballer Steve
Shuber who is a junior, are sopho-
mores. Of these the best prospect
seems to be Vitunac, who may be
elevated to starting duty.

The lineup will probably re-
main the same as last week with
Brown at first, Fisher at second,
Kostenbauder at short, Wilner on
third, and Jacobs, Vaiksnor, and
Felstein in the outﬁeld. However,
it has been rumored that Jacobs
and Vaiksnor, both former infield-
ers, may be called back for inﬁeld
duty.

Indiana is expected to again ﬁeld
a strong club. Last, year's game,

Golfers In

Win Over Carnegie Tech

Pitt's golfers started their sea-
son oﬁ’ on the right foot last Tues-
day afternoon by taking the Car-
negie Tech team in camp, 9-0. The
matches were played at the Tacoma
Country Club.

The Panthers swept all the
matches in fairly easy fashion, the
only close contest coming in the
last match between Iorbors, of
Pitt, and Tecb's Edwin Anderson.

The results:

Bill Kramer, Pitt, defeated Ward
Duchcns, 9 and 7; Harry Simpson,
Pitt, defeated Carl Champion, 9
and 8; Pitt won best ball, 10 and 8.

Bob Walkinshaw, Pitt, defeated
George‘ Tondorf, 5 and 3; Steve
Bilowich, Pitt, defeated John Shy-
mowsky, 3 and 2; Pitt won best
ball, 2 and 1.

Dave Thurbon, Pitt, defeated
  aﬁd 5; - ,.Be1'b.0.rer

up; Pitt won best ball. 3 and 2.
Art Underwood's boys will trav-
el to Annapolis to take on the

Navy Middies next Saturday. In

spite of the victory the Panthers

scored over the Tu-tans, the Ser-
vice mon must be installed as fa-
vorites, for they are recognized as
one of the strongest teams in the

East. A Pitt triumph, however, is

not too much to expect, for Un-

derwoodls proteges really showed
that they had a lot on the ball last

Tuesday.

Panther hopes are banked on
Bill Kramer and junior Harry
Simpson, Edgewood letterman.
Both of these boys showed that
they were of championship cut in
the Tartan match, and if both
should come through next Satur-
day, 9. sweet and well-deserved vic-

tory will go on the right side of

the Panther A ledger,

 

Wilk, Vitanek, Fisher, Kostenbauder, McCullough. Back

row: Vaiksnor, Palanzo, Nabors,

Ranii, McKee, Jacobs,

which was played at Indiana, was
won by the Panthers 4-2 with Bob
Malloy, ace of the Panther mound
corps last year, doing the pitching.

This year the West Virginia
schedule, like that of the Panthers,
has been cut by the University's
accelerated war program. They
will play twelve games, but when
they meet the Panthers on Monday
and Tuesday they will have al-
ready played ﬁve of those twelve.
Their opener with Bethany on the
eleventh of April was canceled
because of the muddy condition of
the ﬁeld. However, the team will
have the advantage of having play-
ed games with George Washing-
ton, University of Maryland, Navy,

Carter and Stickel Lead Pitt Cindermen;
Duke Favored in Philadelphia Classic

By VINCE QUATRINI _
Coach Carl Olson’s outdoor cm-
der squad rolls into Philadelphia
for the classical Penn Relay Car-
nival on the campus of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania tomorrow
for their ﬁrst taste of big league
outdoor competition. ‘
The Blue and Gold spikers will
be pitted against the greatest out-
door performers in the track world.
Approximately 500 athletes wear-
ing the colors of universities and
colleges from all over the country
will participate in this gala affair.
Representing the Jungle Cats are
eight spike wearers. Leading the
pack will be “Hap” Stickel and
“Bullet” Bill Carter, veterans of
previous Penn Relay wars. Others
under the Pitt banner include Al
Peretic, Bob Smith, Bob Davis, Jim
Elliot, Bill . Curtis and Dusty
Rhoades.
Carter, Smith, Peretic and Stick-
el, exchanging the baton in that or-
der, will be entered in the mile

relay, the 880 relay and the 440
relay. According to Coach Olson
the locals will make their strongest
bid in the quarter-mile and half-‘
mile relays.

Besides carrying the bamboo in
the handicap races, Stickel and Car-
ter will be entered in the 100 yard
dash. Perhaps their strongest rival
will be Barney Ewell, from Penn
State, who proved to be a thorn in
their side in the indoor season.

However, both Stickel and Car-
ter have their own ideas about
their strongest contender. “Bullet
Bill” said, as he bounced up and
down keeping warm, “I'll beat

Ewell because I think I have his

number now. The only one that

l’m afraid of is my teammate

(Ham! 9’

Stickel had just ﬁnished practic-
ing the exchange of batons and
trotted off the track and exclaimed,
“If I beat my buddy (Carter), then
I know I'll win.”

27 Pitt Athletes To Receive Diplomas
Sunday; Football Squad Hardest Hit

Football leads the way, as twen-
ty-seven Pitt athletes walk the Sol-
diers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Hall
aisle next Sunday for their respec-
tive degrees in the University's

first advanced wartime commence-l

ment exercises.

Eleven Blue and Gold men will
trade pigskins for sheepskins. Ed-
gar “Special Delivery" Jones will
join Lieutenant Commander Gene
Tunney’s entourage of physical ed-
ucation instructors immediately
after graduation.

Jones’ football efforts proved to
he one of the more memorable oc-
currences of the recent football
season. Edgar doubled in athletics,

Grove City

The varsity tennis team of Grove

, City College will come to Pitts-

burgh this Saturday afternoon to
help open the home tennis season
For the Pitt players and followers.

Coach Doc. Hartwig’s boys are
eagerly awaiting the arrival of the
Grovers, for they are anxious to
set their one-game record on an
even keel. The Panthers absorbed

- a 9-0 shellacking from the Ohio
State team in their first match, and
that defeat is still burning the boys
from the Trees Gym courts.

Dick Trimble will open in the
number one spot for the Panthers.
He will be followed by Henry
Grance in two, and Bill Reece in
three.

Fourth man will. be Bill Nicke-
son. Number live is Frank Wynn,
and either Jimmy Deutelbaum or
Bobby Gaylen will play in the sixth
slot.

The doubles matches will show
Trimble and Grance, Reece and
Nickeson, and Wynn and either
Deutelbaum or Gaylen.

Three men are gone from last

year's Panther outﬁt, Captain Ed I

Goering, Frank Harmuth and
Frank Gaenger.
Like the Panthers, the Grove

City squad has also lost three men.
Returning from last year’s team
are Robert Hulton, George Steck,
and William Weidler, who w.ll play
one, two, three in that order. The
other three men have not been chos-
en yet, with the following men in
line for those spots: Bill White,
John McDowell, Arthur Thompson,

being an outstanding performer
with Ralph Mitterling’s baseball
squad.

In addition to Jones, other Pan-
ther athletes joining Uncle Sam’s
forces are Johnny Ross of the grid
squad, who‘ is joining the marine
corps ofﬁcer training school, Mau-
rice Jessup of the track and field
squad, and gridder Johnny Stahl
and Marty Kramer of the swim-
ming team, who have been admit-
ter to the air corps.

Cinderman Jim Elliot and Pan-
ther footballman Harry Kinde1berg-
er have received commissions as
naval ensigns. Elliot is Penn Re-
lays javelin champion and will at-
tempt to retain that crown in Phil-
adelphia this week-end.

Top-scorers and co-captains of
the basketball squad Eddie Ziol-
kowski and Larry Paffrath, will
not be with Coach H. C. Carlson
when the next ﬂoor season comes
around. “Lefty” is already in the
Navy while Butler bomber Pai-

irath is scheduled to leave for the

service in the very near future.

The swimming squad loses ﬁve
graduates, while Cinder Coach Carl
Olson will have to do without four
of his current season athletes.

The complete list of graduates
listed in accordance to their sports
is as follows:

Football: Edgar Jones, Joe Con-
nell, John Ross, Ray Rabinek, Bob
Crissrnan, John Stahl, Stan Ger-
velis, Harry Kindelberger, George

pole vault and Jim Elliot tossing

the javelin. Both of these boys
should be able to go far'tomo-rrow,
especially Rhoades as he is a great-
er threat in the open than he is in
the enclosed ﬁeld.

Bob Davis will round out the out-
ﬁt performing in the sprint med-
lay. At this writing Coach Olson
had notidecided upon the other med-
lay teams that he was going to run
in the carnival.

Topping the ﬁeld will be two
eastern schools, Yale and Penn
State, and one southern squad,
Duke University. Penn State will
be unusually strong and will be
probably labeled the “dark horse”
of the competition. Duke, without

a doubt, will be strong and will be -

out for a repeat win as they cap-
tured top honors last year at Phila-
delphia.

The first part of the Panther
squad left yesterday and the re-
mainder will leave today. All ex-
uept Rhoades and Elliot entrained
for Philly yesterday. The Jungle
Cats will stay at the Philadelphia
Hotel, located on the University of
Pennsylvania’s campus.
