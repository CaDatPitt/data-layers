Activities fee increase approved

By John B. Moore

News Assistant

The Student Affairs
Committee Board of Trustees
voted in a 25-percent raise in
the Student Activities Fee yes-
terday.

The eight dollar increase
will bring fees up to $40 a
term for all non-College of
General Studies undergradu-
ates.

Because of inflation since
1987, the year of the last stu-

dent activities fee hike, the
Student Government Board
said the increase is justified.
SGB President Ross
Pasquale pointed to a 45 per-
cent growth in student groups
since 1987, as a major reason
for the fee increase. Also justi-
fying the fee increase, accord-
ing to Pasquale, is the 40—per-
cent cut across—the-board in all
student organization budgets
last year, and the price increas-
es in The Pitt News ads since
1987, where many campus

groups spend their funds.

“Fee increases have been
looked at very deliberately 
we try to hold the line for stu-
dents,” said Alice Kindling,
chair of the SACBT.

“At the request of the stu-
dents and our various con-
stituencies, we have a compi-
lation of requests for fee
increases  a necessity for
matriculating and enhancing
program developments within
the various student bodies.”

Electrical fire damages Sigma Chi house

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor

An electrical fire at the Sigma Chi fraternity
house on Universtiy Drive last Wednesday
morning has forced eight Pitt students to look
for a new place to call a temporary home.

“Everything I owned was destroyed,” acting
President of Sigma Chi Heath Golden said

Fire fighters contained the blazeto one room
but the entire third floor suffered smoke and

water damage.

Golden and several others have since been
looking for a place to stay.

“I have no idea what I’m going to do. I’ve
heard everything from two weeks to the entire
summer,” Golden said about how long before
the building is repaired.

Retro look helps Catbeclrallights win award

By Kathleen Scanlon
For The Pitt News

Those who have recently
walked around the Cathedral
of Learning at night may not
have noticed the 13-foot-tall
cast-iron and aluminum light
posts lining their paths.

“The key was finding a fix-
ture that looked like it always
had been there,” said Deborah
Rouse, Pitt’s Associate
Director of Architecture and
the project’s designer.

The Pittsburgh Historic

Review Commission recently
honored the University of
Pittsburgh for the design of the
lights with an Outstanding
Preservation Award, presented
to Rouse by Pittsburgh Mayor
Tom Murphy.

Rouse, a member of Pitt’s
Facilities Management staff,
selected the design to reflect
the style of the 1930s, when
the cathedral was built.

The Facilities Management
staff launched the project in
November 1992 when it
examined the types of light

fixtures used in the early
1930s, according to Rouse.

“Finding out what people
did at that time was not as dif-
ficult as providing a nice,
comfortable pedestrian-scaled
[walkway] that would bring
you from the busy streets into
the park areas of the cathedral
and make [the area] more hos-
pitable,” she said.

The staff mixed and
matched various types of lens-
es, bases and posts in its
searchfor the right image,
Rouse said.

No ark

Pitt's new
business
school

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom
Murphy announced last
week the city will not
give up any park land for
Pitt’s construction of an
undergraduate business
school, marking a major
victory for Oakland resi-
dent groups who have
been lobbying against the
university’s “land swap”
proposals.

Pitt’s further develop-
ment in the proposed area
would harm Oakland.
according to four neigh-
borhood groups that have
been speaking with
Murphy since March.

“We believe Schenley
Park belongs to all of the’
citizens of Pittsburgh, and
under no circumstances
should park land be used
for development,” said
Oakland Directions, Inc.
(ODl),Oakland.
Neighborhood Alliance
(ONA), Oakland
Planning and Develop-
ment Corp.(OPDC) and
Preservation Pittsburgh in
their letter to Murphy.

They also noted con-
struction on Joncaire
Street would destroy the
only remaining buffer

-between the Boundary
Street neighborhood.
which is behind the
Katz business school, and
Pitt.

Before Murphy’s
announcement, five pro-
posals for the business
school site were under

“We shipped in bits and
pieces into the basement of
Benedum Hall, [assembled
them and] experimented with
detail to find an image appro-
priate for the historic areas of
campus,” she said.

Pitt completed phase one of
the project when it surrounded
the cathedral with the -light
posts last year.

The university will enter
phase two when it installs the
lights in all but the most mod-

ern stretches of campus,

News In Brief...

International

Seoul, South Korea —— The
leaders of North Korea were
warned yesterday by South
Korea that they risked con-
frontation with the world if
they did not accept United
Nations demands to open up
nuclear sites to international
inspectors.

“North Korea must realize
the unfortunate reality that it is
inviting confrontation with the
international community,” the
Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.

Seoul was reacting to the
adoption of an llth-hour presi-
dential statement by the U.N.
Security Council on Monday
calling on North Korea to
cooperate with U.N. inspectors
whom it has prevented from
checking a suspect nuclear
reactor. —Reuters

Kigali, Rwanda -— The death
of a senior officer in Rwanda
has resulted in the U.N. mis-
sion suspending its operations.

The officer was killed by a
mortar blast yesterday.

U.N. forces known as
UNAMIR said all movement
of officers and convoys has
been suspended until the situa-
tion has been stabilized.

‘‘It is inhuman to ask some-

one to go out when he sees his
friend has fallen,” said
Brigadier General Henry
Anyidoho,UNAMIR’s deputy
force commander.

“We have tried to talk to
both (warring) sides everyday
to let us continue humanitarian
assistance. They just don’t
seem to listen.”

The U.N. earlier had dis-
patched teams of military
observers to investigate aid-
agency reports that 500 people
were massacred at a refugee
camp in government territory,
U.N. ‘officials said yesterday.

Washington, D.C. — Dan

Rostenkowski is considered
essential to helping Hillary
Rodham Clinton’s health-
reform plan get through
Congress, but he must step
down as chairman now that he
has been indicted.

“Federal prosecutors threat-
ened to indict me if I fail to

UPMC merges with
local St. Margaret's

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical - Center has
announced an affiliation
agreement with St. Margaret
Memorial Hospital near
Aspinwall to collaborate the
massive resources of UPMC
with the family practice spe-
ciality of St. Margaret.

The letter of intent for the
affiliation was signed on May
24 by the board of directors
and medical staff leadership at
St. Margaret, according to
Pitt’s Health Sciences News
Bureau.

“The partnership of a major
academic medical center with
a strong community hospital
sets the stage for cost-effec-
tive service delivery that is
essential in a managed—care
environment,” said the presi-

dent of St. Margaret, Stanley
J. Kevish.

St. Margaret, a community-
based hospital near Aspinwall
which holds 267 beds, will be
partially funded by Pitt in
order to provide various sup-
port services more efficiently.

“Key elements of this plan
include strengthening of pri-
mary care and enhancing
SMMH’s family-practice resi-
dency, the most well—regarded
program in the area,” said
UPMC’s Vice President for
Managed Care Dr. Loren
Roth.

Even though the agreement
does not mean exclusive refer-
rals between institutions, pres-
ident of UPMC Jeffrey
Romoff said it is a first step
“toward developing a network
of health-care providers
that together will permit us to

Martha Garvey, president of
OPDC, said the community
took action as soon as they
heard a “land swap” deal was
in the planning stages, which
would have included the city
conceding park land to Pitt.

“Absolutely no park land
should be given to the univer-
sity for development.” Garvey
said. “[Community groups] are
working together to insure the
preservation of the city’s park
land.”

City Council member Dan
Cohen, who represents a sec-
tion of Oakland, joined
the groups in opposition to_
“any private or quasi-private
development of public park
land.”

“Encroachment by develop-
ers on public park land would
be detrimental to the surround-
ing community and the city as
a whole,” Cohen said in a let-
ter to Murphy.

Pitt Director of Parking and

said that he hopes to have

The project emerged from
the chancellor’s Task Force on
Campus Safety and Security

that called for more lighting
and emergency phones,
according to Harkins.

Each phase of the lighting
project draws $200,000 from
the Student Transportation

beyond that amount.

Also discussed at the meet-
ing was a computerized
resume referral system devel-
oped by the Student
Placement Center.

Robert Perkoski demon-
strated the program along
with Alum-Net, another com-
puterized program that helps
students get in contact with
University of Pittsburgh
alumni.

The resume referral system
was developed to connect
perspective employers with
graduating seniors in a mini-
mal amount of time.

“One of our goals is to find
the right students for the right
jobs,” said Perkoski. “This
will help us find the criteria
[the employer] is looking for.
We used to spend ten days,
now we spend one.”

All registered seniors will
be on file with a listing of
their major, QPA, activities
they are involved in, job pref-
erence and where they are
willing to work geographical-
ly. A representative of the
Placement Center can then
retrieve possible candidates
for a job and pass the infor-
mation along to the employer.

“If a company calls  on
Monday, we can do the search
and fax them the resume on
Tuesday; they come out on

Fire
°Fr0m page 1

After the fire, Pitt provided
housing in Tower A and
Lothrop Hall to those whose
rooms were damaged, accord-
ing to Bob Hopkins, director
of Housing Services.

The problem is where
to live until things are
back to normal, because i
the university is going to
start charging those who
plan on staying in
Lothrop Hall, Golden
said. _ \

Hopkins said the uni— 
versity provided free
housing Tuesday,
Wednesday and
Thursday of last week so
the victims could get
back ‘on their feet, and
Housing Services ’
extended the free hous-
ing until this week
because of the length of
the Memorial Day week-
end. ‘

But those who wish to
continue staying in
Lothrop Hall must start ,.
paying Lothrop Hall
rates, which are more
expensive then what the frater-
nity charges its members,
Hopkins said. “Everyone else
[in Lothrop] is paying,”
Hopkins said. “We’re not try-
ing to make things difficult.
We’re trying to makes things
as easy as we can.”

Golden said that most of the

  

victims of the fire have moved
into other bedrooms of the
house until they have the time
to figure out what to do.
Currently, Golden and the

other victims are busy dealing

 

which then subleases to mem-
bers of the fraternity, accord-
ing to Hopkins, so there is a

Hopkins said his department is

they are waiting for the stu-

which Golden described as
simply “throwing everything

"The sooner we can get on

Dirty politicians hurt voters

Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, was indicted today by a federal grand jury
on charges of embezzlement, conspiracy, witness tampering,
obstruction of justice, mail and wire fraud — 17 counts in all.

Rostenkowski maintains his innocence and plans to go to court.

The Pennsylvania legislature voted 199-0 to impeach State
Supreme Court Justice Rolf Larsen on a wide variety of charges
concerning unethical behavior while in office.

Larsen, despite the overwhelming decision to impeach him,
maintains his innocence, and likewise plans to have his day in
court. -

Why they are wasting taxpayer money to further pursue these
matters is beyond comprehension. _ V

Rostenkowski, one of the most powerful and inﬂuential congress-
men in our country, would not be indicted on these charges unless
there was more than enough evidence to make them stick.

For Rostenkowski to deny these charges, and waste more taxpay-
er money, would simply be an expensive stay of execution.

For Larsen, who also plans to drag out his political death plunge,
a day in court would merely abolish any aura of dignity he had left,
and also drain the taxpayer of more money. .

Whatever thelegal outcomes of the trials, the legal system has
exposed both Rostenkowski and Larsen as arrogant politicians, who
have no respect for their‘ office, or the people who put them there.

Build on your own land

At Pitt’s new business school, undergraduates will be able to
study finance, marketing and most definitely  real estate devel-
opment.

Until yesterday, Pitt entertained the idea of building the new

school on Schenley Park property. One site proposed was beside
the Katz Graduate School of Business; another proposed site was
the park hillside along Joncaire Street.
. Mayor Tom Murphy, however, announced yesterday no city
property will be used for Pitt to build on. Four local neighbor-
hood groups, interested in preventing Pitt from building on city
land. should be elated.

The neighborhood groups opposed the idea for fear of the neg-
ative effects caused by further real estate development in
Oakland. _ _

“We believe Schenley Park belongs to all of the citizens of
Pittsburgh, and under no circumstances should park land be used
for development,” the groups wrote in a letter to Murphy.

Murphy should be commended for his preservationist instinct
concerning city property and the Oakland community.

Although the undergraduate school itself is a worthwhile, long-
awaited, and long—overdue addition to our university, Pitt should

, not use it as an excuse to chip away at the remaining undevel-

oped real estate that exists in Oakland.

Pitt should investigate the three remaining options: building
the school on top of the existing graduate school and connecting
it to Forbes Quad, suspending the school above Roberto
Clemente Drive and connecting it to Forbes Quad and Mervis
Hall. or building on the South Bouquet Street parking-lot site.

Any of these proposals would preserve the Oakland communi-
ty, and would present a refreshing alternative to pillaging the
park land.

the real thrust of Dr. King’s

not possible without reconcili-
ation and relationship. On the
other hand, the militancy that
has dominated the civil-rights
movement since the late—’60s
has focused much more on
“rights” than on bridge-build-
ing, and as a consequence has
basically stalled.

The trouble is that the black
community has pursued power
rather than justice, and the
problem with power is that the

primary premise that racism is
a permanent fixture in
American society and, as such,
the fight to eradicate it must go
on._With all due respect to my
namesake, I don’t agree with
that assessment one bit.

One of the problems with
the way racism is being fought
today is that the battle general-
ly takes place at an institution-
al level — such as the levels of
government. education and
industry. Usually the emphasis
is on the number of blacks
employed by a particular firm,
especially in decision—making
positions. If there are fewer
employed than some people
would like, that company
might be subject to protests or
lawsuits.

Now, fair employment is
certainly a worthy goal, but it
does absolutely nothing to
combat racism, which I define
as relating to others based pri-
marily on their race. color... or
ethnic origin.

racism is the specific social
problem, you find that there

fighting to look as though
progress is being made (even
when it isn’t).

It’s a lot like children from
dysfunctional families creating

As things turned out, none of

food, fun, fellowship, a cham-

instruction in the “electric

same “koinonia” at worship on
Sunday. Two months later I
asked Carol how her new
friends felt about me, and I
was apparently a hit. They
even asked if we were dating

If I ever move to Chicago,
and I’m thinking about it, I
might join that church. Those
people tore down the walls

takes to end racism, breaking
down the barriers and building

There are simply no other

The Merchant Of Venice
Three Rivers Shakspeare
Festival

Through June 11

As one of Shakespeare’s
most controversial plays, the
Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival took a big risk in
opening their fifteenth‘ season
with the dark comedy, The
Merchant of Venice. In our
politically correct world, this
play’s themes of intolerance
and anti-semitism are piercing-
ly apparent. There are no
heroes, and no divisions
between the good and the evil.
Despite these obstacles, the
Festival’s clever interpretation
succeeds,’ if not in making
everybody happy, in leaving
the audience satisfied with a
fine performance.

The choice to set the play in
Mussolini’s Italy circa-1938
was a wise one. It was easier
for the audience to relate to.
We feel the prejudice against
the Jewish people as an under-
current to Shylock’s vengeful
speeches —— a good counter-

 

balance. The play deals with
the animosity between
Shylock, the money lender and

Antonio, a merchant of Venice. ‘
Antonio wants to lend money

to his friend Bassanio, who

needs it to successfully woo

Portia, the heiress. In exchange

for the loan, Shylock tricks

Antonio into sealing his bond

with a “pound of flesh” as col-

lateral. Foolishly, Antonio

agrees. The emphasis of the

bond of ﬂesh, and the bond of

fortune is blatantly evident in

this production. It hinges on all

the romances as well (of

course there are several — it’s

Shakespearel), from Shylock’s

daughter’s romance with

Lorenzo; to Bassanio, who

must impress his beloved with

wealth, and choose the correct

metal chest encasing her pic-

ture to win her hand.

Brian Rose is both coldly
bitter and sympathetically
human as Shylock. It turned
my stomach to watch him
tauntingly sharpen his knife,
bent on revenge. Yet Rose
allowed an ounce of pity to be

  

‘

The Merch

squeezed out of his character,

by the end. Laura Ann
Worthen’s (also the artistic
director of the festival) Portia
tells the majority of her story
solely through her facial
expressions and lilting voice.
Her performance was direct
and intelligent. John Neville-
Andrews provided the most
noticeable English accent as
Antonio, but his character
came off (purposely?) as too
good to be true.

The supporting cast, com-
prised of Pitt, Carnegie Mellon
and Temple Theater depart-
ments, came shamelessly close
to stealing the show. Stiikingly
handsome John Littlefield is
the David Caruso (see “NYPD
Blue”) of Bassanios. He exud-
ed integrity, and even though
Bassanio’s decisions weren’t
always the best ones, he made
the audience believe he
thought they were. William

‘-\..

Zielinski (Leonardo) and
Wendy Fencsak (Nerissa)
made the most of their charac-
ters. Jason Antoon’s cameo as
the Prince of Aragon left the
audience roaring. _

The metamorphizing sets
were kept minimal, and slight-
ly on the dark side. The men’s
suits were striking. The use of
Nazi/Fascist uniforms and
oppressive backgrounds made
the playwright’s anti-semitic
characterization of Shylock (a
very typical view in his time)
seem pale in comparison to the
prejudice against him. It was a
very politically correct answer
to a trying problem for an
audience of the ‘90s.

There are no innocents in
this play. Gentiles and Jews
alike are equally susceptible to
the basest lusts, prejudices and
infidelities of human nature.

That is the impression the

can’t be duplicated even if the formula was given.
The strength of this album .relies on the lyrics and
rhyme style; not so much the tracks. The phattest
tracks, in the way of the music fitting the style, are
“Come Clean,” “My Mind Spray,” “You Can’t
Stop The Prophet” & “Statik” (even though I
can’t stand record static.) The “Perverted Monks
In Tha House” skits along with the intro is extra
phat; “obese” to put it in a word. Heshould’ve
rhymed on these. “Da Bichez” is a smooth jazz
groove that allows him to calmly diss gold-diggin’-
no-job-havin’-money-and-possession-hungry hoes.
“My Mind Spray” has lyrics that are just on
another plane; Jeru is so surreal at times that he
sends your mind on a jagged trip.

Overall, the album is tight minus some minor
adjustments. For instance, if there was another
drum track for “D. Original,” coupled with that
rubber—roomed-straight-jacket piano, this could’ve
been another underground classic. Sometimes, it
seems like Primo got a little lax on the music and
let it slip.

The Mystery 0fKustom1zed
Kustomized
Matador

Kustomized marks the
return of one of the best, and
naturally unsung, songwriters
to come out of punk rock —
Peter Prescott. For the better
half of the last 14 years, Mr.
Prescott has been making a
racket with bands like Mission
of Burma and the Volcano
Suns.

In the early ‘80s, Burma
took the angry young man/art
punk sound of English bands
like Wire and came up with an
American version. Though
they broke up early on, they
forged the beginnings of a
sound that would later become
known as indie rock.

As serious as Mission of
Burma was, the Volcano Suns
were proportionately absurdist
(or goofy, as Prescott said on
several occasions). For eight
years, Prescott led countless
lineups of the band, bellowing
in a raging baritone behind his
drum kit. Their six albums
sport collisions between noise,
melody and brilliantly twisted
lyrics that haven’t been topped

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 1 , 1994

   

SlIlC€.

With Kustomized, Prescott
has made a big change. He
traded in his drum kit for a
guitar. Gone are the thunder-
ing rolls which were such a
trademark of the Suns.
(Believe me, Prescott had a
distinctive attack.)

But the warped vision and
the fractured baritone remain.
For starters, the band photo on
the back of the record shows
all four Kustomized members
decked out in suits, ﬂanking a
cutout (or is it a blowup doll?)
of a swank looking dame who
might’ve hung on Sinatra’s
arm in his heyday.

Musically, Kustomized
picks up where the Volcano
Suns left off. The guitars slice
and bite without falling into
the realm of pure noise.
Prescott still prefers writing
melodic songs, even adding

harmony vocals on a few

tracks, and lets the band add
the chaos later.

Despite being just a six—song
EP, The Mystery of features
several brilliant lyrics. “Big
Trick,” which kicks things off,
features the couplet: “When

be wearing a stupid grin/ when

still won’t know what it’s all
about/ What’s it, what’s it.
what’s it all about?!”

But the most memorable line
has to be “How can I feel
senile when I feel so infan-
tile?” from ‘‘It Lives!” Maybe
I’m reading too much into the
song, but Prescott sounds as if
he’s ruminating about being an
elder statesman in a musical
field of young sprouts. (If my
calculations are correct. he’s
36 years old.) The song pre-
cedes a track entitled
“Nothing. Not No One.”
(which is self-reflexive) and a
cover of Joy Division’s “Dead
Souls” which sounds like more
of a dirge than the original.
Are these songs the result of
the same old goofiness or self-
pity or both? Either way it
makes for great listening.

As far as Prescott’s axework
goes, it’s hard to discern his
playing apart from that of Ed
Yazijian. They seem to play
together to thicken the sound
rather than spice up the
arrangements with separate
parts. And none of the songs
have guitar solos to speak of.
They sound basic yet driving
and effective.

Matador will be releasing a
full—length album by
Kustomized later this year. so
there’s no need to complain
about this only being a six-
song release. This is enough to
keep you satiated for the next
few months. And it’s good to
know that a talent (visionary?)
like Peter Prescott is still play-
ing and still going strong.

Getting {Over Tom
By Abigail Thomas
Algonquin Books, $16.95.

Abigail Thomas’s first poke at adult fiction serves as a light-
hearted commentary illustrating the stages of American female
life. As a former author of three children’s books. Thomas is a
pro at helping her readers identify with characters who are in the
midst of romance, adolescent hormones, and casual sexual
encounters. The truth hits hard in this collection of familiar tales
and stays amazingly funny at the same time.

Getting Over Tom consists of hilarious short stories tracing the
development of various relationships beginning with two young
sisters and their mother who is “always leaving the room to do
something important somewhere else.” After the mother ignores
her youngest daughter’s birthday, the sisters set out to “to teach
her a lesson.” In “Sisters,” their final revenge displays Thomas’s
ridiculous and playful style as they plot to make it look as if they
were murdered in their bathtub. .

Thomas’s short stories are all over the place. She even
includes a scenario for those of us who have endured a stale rela-
tionship in “Just Married.” Virginia is a teenage girl who has just
shocked her boyfriend with the news that she is pregnant and
they must get married, but he has other plans. Buddy would
rather hang out with his drinking pal, Chick, who can say “You
have white teeth” five times in a row while burping. Buddy has

' the bad karma of being stereotyped as the unfeeling boyfriend

equipped with a football helmet and a six—pack. Virginia desper-
ately wants Buddy’s affection but she feels like “a piece of
pound cake [that] he’d get tired of after a while.” They avoid
each other at all costs and resort to “‘excuse me,’ like strangers
on a bus” if they brush into each other in the hallway. All of
these characters are perched on the edge of some sort of revela-
tion, and in this case, Virginia becomes determined that her life

is destined for a marriage where I“you spend all day wa
your husband to come home, and then when he does, it’s no big
deal.”

“A Tooth For Every Child” is the unfolding of some serious
humiliation around the menopausal Louise who captures a
woman’s sense of vulnerability while remaining intelligent.
Thomas reminds us that these two qualities can coexist even as
Louise, mother of four and twice divorced, has a brief ﬂing with
a 20-year-old construction worker. After Lousie’s tooth falls out
from her moo shu pork, she feels forced to confess her age but
can still percieve something humorous from her embarassing sit-
uation. There seems to be a cycle of you win, you lose, you win
again. It is typical of Thomas’s characters to feel like losers and
defeated at times, but they always come through with their zany
sides.

“Man & Wife” is an account of a pregnant and scared new
wife that lies naked on her cool linoleum kitchen floor with the
fans blowing on her because it “is the only tolerable spot left in
the universe.” The air vibrates with tension from this moving
story. A reader will ulitimately feel her fear and realize that this
is her only means of adjusting to her shaky marriage. One will
instantly remember that forgotten face that had ruled their heart
at one time as an additional bonus.

Thomas intricately combines the hard facts of life with comi-
cal remarks, making it a pleasure to find a common thread of
recognition. It is easy to appreciate stories that are told from the
point of view of long-suffering women of all ages that slap a lit-
tle bit of everyone’s past onto the pages before them. This book
reminds us of familiar incidents while making us take a hard
look at ourselves, a scared friend, or a not—so—perfect mother.
Abigail Thomas’s quick punches and witty wisecracks acknowl-
edge experiences of love, lust, disillusioment, and growing up
that everyone can relate to in this collection.

Columnist increasing
Matt Groff number of
draftees,

college baseball has become
the most popular college sport
aside from the revenue-pro-
ducing machines of football
and basketball.

In the last year and a half,
coaching changes at Pitt have
led to transitions in both the
basketball and football pro- V
grams, which have refocused
efforts on recruiting and the
future. Asinteresting as it may
be to watch the formation of a
new program, most fans want
to see a team win and that is
what Pittbaseball has deliv-
ered this season and has put
itself in a position to do for
years to come. ‘

Interestingly, as the universi-
ty spends millions to improve
football and basketball facili-
ties to help snag better
recruits, baseball head coach
Mark Jackson and his staff
have now gained the most
effective recruiting tool -
winning. The accomplishment
is even more impressive con-
sidering the superior facilities '
of many of Pitt’s opponents
and the fact the Panthers play
on afield barely on par with
most high school fields I’ve
seen.

This season Pitt won the reg-
ular-season Big East title with
a 16-5 record, by far Pitt’s best
season ever. The program has
quietly turned around since its
20-106 (.159) Big East record
between the creation of the
conference in 1985 and the
1992 season. A big reason for
the turnaround is Jackson, who
was recently named 1994 Big
East Coach of the Year. The
team’s record has consistently
improved under Jackson, who
is only in his fourth season at
Pitt.

Despite their success in the
Big East, rated as one of the
top six college baseball con-
ferences last year, Pitt’s lack-
luster performances against
non-conference opponents
have drawn criticism and
probably cost them an NCAA
regional berth.

Even though some of Pitt’s
losses were pretty surprising,

Today, seven of Pitt’s swiftest female
track athletes will compete in the biggest
meet of their season. Led by seniors Allison
Williams, Kim Blair and sophomore
Najuma Fletcher, the Panthers will attempt
to cap off their record-breaking year this
week at the 1994 NCAA Track and Field
Championships in Boise, Idaho. '

Women’s track head’ coach Steve Lewis’
feels that in order for Pitt to fare well it will
have to concentrate on its individual perfor-
mances. .

“We are not going around the meet think-
ing about our overall performarice,” Lewis
said. “If everybody does very well we will
do very well. We would like for the kids to
do as well as they can do.”

When talking about doing the best one
can do, Fletcher, the lone All—American
during the indoor season, has the best
chance of continuing where she left off in
February. As of last week, she qualified for
an unheard of six different events. These
events are the heptathlon, long jump, high
jump, triple jump, the 100-meter hurdles
and the mile relay. *

Due to several events going on at the
same time, Fletcher withdrew from the hur-
dles and the long jump. But that should not
cause a problem. To become an All-
American one must finish in the top-8 in a
respected event. Fletcher’s performances
thus far this season make her the favorite to
receive All-American honors in three differ-

CHI CVCDIS.

She is currently ranked eighth in the high
jump, third in the heptathlon and the triple
jump. Not bad for a second-year athlete. _

But according to Lewis, it will not be that‘ ‘
easy. “It will take a great performance to

Shot putter used to clearing life's hurdles

By David Saliba
F or The Pitt News

On Jan. 1, 1994, a car acci-
dent left Jim Monk, a shot put
and discus thrower at Pitt, with
career-threatening injuries. By

the end of February, he was in ,

Syracuse, N.Y. competing at
the men’s track and field Big
East Indoor Championship.

To overcome adversity and
succeed is a feat that should
not go unnoticed. It seems that
recognition has eluded Monk,
a 22 year-old senior thrower on
the Pitt men’s track and field
team, who has beaten certain
odds to become a champion in
athletics as well as in life.

“Jim has been down a hard
road, but that is what makes
him persevere,” said John
Vasvary, head coach of the Pitt
men’s track and field team.

The athletic career of Monk
at the University of Pittsburgh
has become nothing less than
brilliant. A two—time Big East
outdoor champion in the shot
put and discus, he has attained
championship status, though
the road to success has been all
but smooth.

During Christmas break of
this year in Nelsonville, Ohio,
Monk was involved in a car
accident that left him with seri-
ous damage to his sternum.

“I tore the cartilage of my

sternum bone when my chest,

crashed against the steering
wheel,” Monk said of the car
accident. “Mentally it was a
setback.”

“The wreck really put Jim
behind,” Vasvary said. “The
type of injury he had would
put most people  ‘ 
out for months
but he was back
in less than
two.”

The injuries
that Monk sus-
tained caused a
major setback
to his condition-
ing program as
well. V

“He wasn’t able to lift
[weights] for months and con-
sequently his [body] weight
dropped,” said Jack Reich-
enbach, track and field head
coach at Nelsonville-York
High in Ohio where Monk
attended high school.

Over the past few years,
Reichenbach, who has devel-
oped a strong relationship with
Monk, has often traveled three
and a half hours to Pitt to
coach him. This year they have
been meeting three times a
week at a neutral location.

“I meet with Jimmy at
Barnesville High, in Ohio to

Pitt thrower Jim Monk

work on his throws,”
Reichenbach said.

According to Reichenbach,
the accident is only one of
many hurdles that Monk has
overcome.

“In high school Jimmy was
undersized so we worked real-
ly hard in the weight room to
S‘ ' build his strength up
D to help compensate
’ for the difference in
size of the other
competitors,”
Reichenbach said.

After meeting
Monk through his
wife Barbara, who
is a teacher at the
same high school,
Reichenbach took
Monk under his wing.

“He needed discipline, and
I’m a disciplinarian,”
Reichenbach said. “I don’t put
up with much nonsense and I‘
told Jimmy that if I was going
to coach him he would have to
do everything I said.”

According to Reichenbach,
Monk was serious about track
and soon he developed a
strong and personal relation-
ship with the Reichenbachs.

“Jimmy is like a son tome,”
Reichenbach said. “Whenever
my wife and I go on vacation
Jimmy comes with us.”

“He needed guidance and a

path so we took him in,”
Reichenbach said.

The bond that Monk shares
with the Reichenbachs is a
strong one. His gratitude and
love for the them is evident in
his desire to do well in athlet-
ics and academics. -

“Without [the Reichenbachs]
I never would have gone to
college,” Monk said. “They
put me on a path and I owe
what I’ve accomplished to
them. If it wasn’t for them I’d
be pumping gas somewhere.”

By the end of June, Monk
will have finished with his
degree in Communications.

“For any athlete to get a
degree is a major accomplish-
ment," Scott Bailey a junior
javelin thrower, said. “Jim ran
indoor and outdoor which went
all year ‘round, so that’s saying
something.”

It is a rarity for an athlete to
graduate and even less to do it
on time. He works hard in
school as well as on the field,
Vasvary said.

“Jimmy had goals before he
went to Pitt and though he
wasn’t able to accomplish all
of them I couldn’t be more
elated,” Reichenbach said.

As a high school thrower,
Monk was 60 pounds lighter
than his 250 pound frame as a

Volleyball team inks
international transfer

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

The newest recruit for the
Pitt women’s volleyball team
is from across the northern
border, as the team has ven-
tured into Canada to add a lit-
tle foreign ﬂavor to the pro-
gram.

Stephanie Dufrene is a 5-
foot 10-inch setter from
Montreal who is expected to
fit in very well with
the team.

“She’s a great
player,” Pitt assis- K
tant coach Brian 
Begor said. “She’s 
already played a
year of collegiate
volleyball and we
are very fortunate to
have her.”

Dufrene will be considered a
sophomore, having three years
of eligibility remaining. She
will not have to sit out upon

_ arrival at Pitt because the

University of Montreal, where
she attended school last year,
disbanded its volleyball pro-

gram.
She will be following fellow
countrywoman Laurie

Fernandez of Ontario who
came to Pitt last season, and
gave the Panthers some depth,

since she can both set and hit

from the outside. _
“Many of the Canadian uni-

   
    
   

versities don’t offer scholar-
ships,” Begor said. ‘
For the most part teams are

expected to be self-supporting

and raise their own funds. This
was the case in Dufrene’s situ-
anon.

The University of
Montreal's volleyball team
had to call it quits since the
team could not find the money
to keep itself going.

Pitt is coming off a success-

ful season in which
they went 23-10
and won the Big
East Champion-
ship, which includ-
; ed a trip to the
NCAA Tourn-
ament.
They were also
consistently ranked
in the top-20
nationally.

However, much of Pitt’s
recent success has been due to
the contributions of Ann Marie
Lucanie, who has now gradu-
ated.

Despite the loss of their Big
East Player of the Year, the
Panthers are returning nine of
last year’s 11 members, all of
which now have NCAA tour-
nament experience.

Begor said the team is wait-
ing to hear from other possible
recruits but as for now
Dufrene is the only one to
commit to Pitt.

senior at Pitt. Yet what Monk
lacked in size he made up for
in intensity, a trait which has
followed him through the col-
lege ranks.

“In high school, Jim was
exactly like he was in college,”
Reichenbach said. “He worked
hard and put in all the hours
and did everything that was

much recognition or credit
which is fine by him.

“I don’t care [about publici-
ty] I don’t do it for recogni-
tion,” Monk said.

Yet his accomplishments are

The resiliency and work
ethic of Monk carry over to his
teammates.

“He’s been a leader for us,”
Vasvary said. “The other guys
will come to him because they
know how dedicated he is.”

According to Bailey, the
throwers do not have a coach
so they have looked to Monk
for guidance.

“Jim was coaching Ron
because we don’t have a
coach,” Bailey said, referring
to Ron Losiewicz a freshman
discus thrower.

Being a leader or a coach

“I enjoyed helping out the
guys when they needed it but I
don’t think that makes me a
leader or a coach,” Monk said.

Monk’s success and honors
have never been followed by

and shot put championship
since 1983. That same year he
was named the “Outstanding
Field Performer” at the 1993
Big East Outdoor
Championships.

With all of the success that
Monk has encountered, he still
remains a virtual unknown.
One reason may be due to the
fact that Monk performs his
events away from the stadium
where nobody sees him.

“The throwers are behind
Trees Hall and no one sees us,”
Bailey said.

According to Vasvary, cer-
tain events get overlooked,

“It’s a shame when you have
an athlete such as “Jim who is

Vasvary said. “No one ever

“The whole track and field

team was watching Jim and we _
_all cheered him on,” Bailey

said.

At this point most people
would panic but he wanted to
know what he had to do to
win, Vasvary said.

“I told him that he had to
win and that Ron had to
place,” Vasvary said.

“He looked at me and said.
‘Coach, I’ve waited my whole
life for this,”’ Vasvary said.

According to Vasvary and
Bailey, after Monk won, the
whole team ran up, grabbed
and hugged him. “It was a real
special moment for a real spe-
cial person,” Vasvary said.

As for Monk it turned out to
be the ending of all endings.

“That was the greatest day of
my life,” Monk said.

State’s Debbie-Ann Parris
(55.61) and UCLA’s Keisha
Marvin (57.63) stand in Blair’s
way.

One might think two seconds
is hard to make up, but Blair, the
former All-American, has been
peaking in recent weeks.

In the 100 hurdles, Blair’s
quest for victory will not be as
easy. The time of 13.47 places
her in a tie with Arizona’s
Trecia Roberts for 12th. Blair
should make it to the finals, but
will have to run the race of her
life to capture the100H crown.

One Panther who might just
walk away victorious in that

' event is Allison Williams.

Williams posted a time ofl3.l2
at the Penn Relays on April 30,
ranking her third in the nation.
Williams, the 1992 & 1993
female Most Valuable Performer
at the Penn Relays, might shock
Southern Califomia’s SauYing
Chan and Miami’s Gillian
Russell at the tape.
“Allison has been at the
nationals several times.
Ex erience is a positive on her

side,” Lewis said.

In the 100-meter dash, Pitt
will be represented by Zenia
Ayrton. Ayrton, the fastest
women in India, is the first
women in Pitt history to qualify
at the nationals in the 100.

Ayrton’s time of 11.56 (a
school record) is the 23rd fastest
NCAA qualifying time.

Other Panthers to qualify are
freshman Angie Martin, sopho-
more Ayne Allen and junior
Lakeya Smith.

Martin, the fastest freshman
400-meter hurdler in the nation
(58.03) might come away with
All-American status.

Smith will join Martin,
Fletcher and Blair on the 4x400
meter relay. The foursome’s
time of 3:36.76 ranks the
Panthers eighth in the country.
Allen, an alternate, could
replace Fletcher on the mile
relay.

Pitt Note: No one on the
men's team qualiﬁed.

matter of pride not recognition.
The humble thrower talks of
the team as a whole when
asked about his accomplish-
ments and responds to being
called “outstanding” by
Vasvary with a slight chuckle
and a modest “that was nice of
him.”

The relationship with the
Reichenbachs is the backbone
of Monk’s success, a success
that he will never admit to.

He was the underdog in high
school but he worked hard and
overcame setbacks even in col-
lege, Reichenbach said.

Once in a while we come
across a true underdog who
comes out on top. The odds are
even less that the underdog
becomes a champion.

The odds have always
seemed to be against Jim
Monk which only makes his
career that much more of a
Cinderella story.

‘From page 3

According to Garvey, the
Bouquet Street site is probably
the favorite of community
groups.

“That site was suggested by
someone who lives in the
neighborhood, so I would say
we support it as an alternative
to taking park land,” Garvey
said.

However, feasibility studies
of this alternative site have
uncovered several problems,
according to Pitt’s Director

of Local Relations, Jay
Roling.
“Construction [in the

Bouquet Street lot] would
be costly due to the hard rock
beneath the ground,” Roling
said, “And in terms of operat-
ing efficiency, the site
wouldn’t be nearly as good as
having the business schools
directly beside each other, as
in the other sites.”

Roling said because enough
ground exists for construction,
the university is still taking a
serious look at the site in light
of residents’ concerns.

Some Oakland residents are
skeptical of the need for Pitt to
acquire any land for the busi-
ness school project.

“The university has under-
utilized land and buildings.
We would expect them to
make better use’ of their cur-
rent facilities instead of
interfering with our neighbor-
hoods and park,” Marshall

Goodwin, president of
Oakland Neighborhood
Alliance, said.

Goodwin said sites which
Pitt has acquired and not yet
developed, such as the former
site of the Syria Mosque on
the corner of Bigelow and
O'Hara streets, “were enough
of an intrusion into our com-
munity.”

Perkoski.

The Alum-Net is another
program available in the
Placement Center that allows
graduating students to get in
touch with Pitt alumni for help
and advice in finding employ-
ment.

There are over 600 alumni
listed by state, major and
school in the Alum-Net pro-
gram. '

“If someone comes into my
office and wants to see who
graduated from the School of

Engineering and now lives in
Pittsburgh, that might be able
to help me out,” Perkoski said.
“There are 76 engineers
who’ve graduated from the
school that have volunteered
to help other fellow alum stu-
dents.”

"I think that the most impor-
tant thing that we’ve done.”
Perkoski said, “is that when
we work with students we can
show we’re competitive to
companies and corporations,
organizations. whoever calls
up, that we can find the right
candidate, right now, for the
right job.”
