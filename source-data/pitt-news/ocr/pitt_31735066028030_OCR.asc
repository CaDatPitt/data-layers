Two lumps, no sugar

College Republicans throw tea party to protest SGB

Marc Nuzzo and Anthony Breznican

/ﬁg

It wasn’t a tea party of revolu-
tionary proportions, but yesterday
afternoon, the College Republicans
protested what they called a Student
Government Board “tax” — the stu-
dent activities fee.

The CRs declared the fee “unrep—
resentational” and staged their protest
yesterday because of the federal gov-
ernment’s tax payment deadline.

Standing near the corner of
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard, the CRS hoisted angry
signs as one shouted “SGB is stealing
your money and keeping it!” and
“The SGB is like King George!”

The CR5 handed out tea bags and
implored students to carry them up to
the SGB office, drop them off, and
voice their complaints.

Booker T. Stallworth, publisher
of The Phoenix —— a conservative
publication put out jointly by CMU
and Pitt students — and a protesting
CR, said the protest was based on two
major issues: the fee’s existence and
the fee’s disbursement.

“It is definitely not fair to have
these people, for all intents and pur-
poses, to be taxed,” said Stallworth,
pointing to passing Pitt students.

Stallworth said the SGB’s a1loca- .

tions process is riddled with problems
and that students should have a say in
where their money is spent. He added
that groups should fund themselves if
they wish to remain active and not get
money from the University.

   
    

“The money [students] pay for
the student activity fee is going to
groups they don’t agree with,” he
said.

Gina Reynolds, a fellow protestor
and" CR, held a sign that asked: “Do
you want to pay for BiGaLA, College
Republicans, CWO, SGB retreats?”

“See,” she said. “We put our-
selves on the list, too. Someone came
over and said, ‘I don’t want to pay for
the College Republicans.’ I said,
‘Take some tea bags up to the SGB
office and tell them.’”

Reynolds agreed that groups
should be forced to find their own
financial backing.

“If nobody wants to fund them,
then why should they be in exis-
tence?” Reynolds asked.

Stallworth said the CRs “go out
and do what it takes to do what we
have got to do” to raise support for
their organization.

“There are several large organiza-
tions that [student groups] can get
help from,” he said. He added that he
was very upset that student activities
money is spent on groups like the
Campus Women’s Organization.

“There is no reason why CWO is
going to have three members —-all of
which are elected president —— that
we should fund  to sit in a room,”
Stallworth said.

One of the CRS’ major com-
plaints, said Stallworth, is with the
SGB. He said SGB unfairly doles out
large portions of student activity fee
funding to itself.

Fire kills 50 Muslims in Mecca camp

Around the World

J IDDAH, Saudi Arabia ——- Tragedy
has struck a mass religious gathering
in Saudi Arabia.

Witnesses say up to 50 Muslim
pilgrims died today when fire swept
across a camp outside Mecca. The
dead are mostly Indians, Pakistanis,
and Bangladeshis.

’ The witnesses also say ambu-
lances rushed scores of injured peo-
ple to hospitals.

The fire broke out as some 2
million Muslims gathered at Mecca
in an annual pilgrimage.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -
Republicans have some tough ques-
tions for Attorney General Janet
Reno.

She refused to ask for an inde-
pendent counsel to look into
Democratic fundraising.

Now, House Majority Leader
Dick Armey says congressional
investigators may call Reno to testi-
fy.

Armey told NBC’s “Today
Show” he doesn’t blame Reno. He
said he thinks she’s an “honest,
decent person” who’s just trying to
protect the White House.

Reno argues that there’s no
need for an independent counsel

because therc’s no specific, credible '

evidence implicating high—level
Clinton administration officials in
felonies.

A full—page ad is to appear in the stu-

Tea 

“They consider themselves the largest
[governance group] on campus, so they
give themselves the most money,” he
said. Stallworth vowed to voice his opin-
ion at the SGB office later in the after-
noon.

Up at the SGB office, though, a relat-
ed and unprecedented event caused those
present to wonder exactly what was going
on: A student screamed, threw a handful
of teabags at them, and ran away.

According to Jen Karch, who was
present at the time of the incident, a stu-
dent — whom she said she suspects was a
CR —— was seen pacing outside the office
door. When she asked the individual if
she could help him, he threw 12 teabags
into the office and screamed, “We want
equal representation!”

She said he then just turned and ran
away, leaving everyone in the office
stunned.

Students in the office said they were
“not impressed” with the way the lone
individual chose to express himself.

SGB President Justin DalMolin was
unavailable for comment after the inci-
dent.

Later, said Karch, a woman came up
and handed over another four teabags and
explained her reason for bringing them
up. Soon afterward, Stallworth and stu-
dent Phil Kerpen entered the office and
dumped two boxes of tea on the ﬂoor.

Geoff Bonina, a CR and the SGB’s
Judicial Committee chair, was present at
the “bombardment,” and said he was
angered by the action.

“I agree with our current allocations

. system,” said Bonina. “It’s outlandish that

[the CRs] can’t be a little more civil.”

, In the evening, Board members
Christa Douaihy and David Eisenberg
lead a group of almost fifteen students
into the CRs weekly meeting in David
Lawrence Hall. Douaihy brandished a
plastic bag full of teabags that were
thrown into the SGB office.

“Here you go, Booker,“ Douaihy said,
handing him the bag. “Our parents told us
not to take things from people we don’t
trust. Have your teabags back.”

Stallworth grinned. “Well, I’m glad

you came to the meeting. I’m glad we got
your attention,” he said.
In the meantime, several CRs stood in

the background complaining about the
image today’s protest creates for the
group.
“Booker is acting as a representative

of the national CRs, not this chapter of the
College Republicans,” said Mike Long,
CR vice—president. “We’re never going to
get any respect on this campus until some
people graduate,” he said indicating
Stallworth.
The confrontation between Stallworth
and the horde of student government sup-
porters moved outside, where an argu-
ment ensued over the purpose of the
protest.
“This isn’t productivity, Booker,”
Douaihy said. “Productivity ends where
harassment begins.” .
Douaihy said many of the people who
came up to the SGB office with teabags
threw them in the faces of the SGB secre-
tary and work study students.
“You never even called any Board
members into the room,” Douaihy said.
“You botheredipeople who did nothing to
you.”
Stallworth maintained that what other
people did with the teabags was not his
responsibility.
“No, you expect us to have to act
responsibly, then you do too. You do too,
Booker,” Douaihy said.
As the rest of the crowd dissipated,
Geoff Bonina was the only one left.
Stallworth clapped him on the back, and
they walked toward the meeting.
When asked to comment on how his
actions affected the unity of Pitt’s College
Republicans, Booker shrugged. “I think a
lot of these people are just freshman and
panic a little too much,” he said. “We got
recognition, and we got five new people
interested in joining the club. This was a
successful day.”
- Bonina stood away from him, and
shook his head. “I was really pissed off by
it, frankly,” he said. “You want your cam-
pus organization to be respectable.
Instead of that, I got a handful of teabags
thrown in my face.”

recognizing that he should have one.

“There’s music always happening in
my body,” he says. “Life has such a
rhythm with it. You walk with your own
groove. Some people tune it out, though,
and only think, ‘Got to go to work,’” he
says methodically, hunching his shoul-
ders.

The handmade necklace that always
hangs around his neck and that spells out
“Blindsight” in silver letters shifts back
and forth.

Williams points to his image on the
TV screen and notes the moment he real-
ized that the most important thing was to
share his music with the world. During a
break in his song “Freedom,” Williams —
then a college sophomore — calls for the
audience to answer him by singing,
“Freedom, freedom, yeah.”

“I didn’t know if they were going to
just sit and look at me,” Williams recalls.
“The BAS was the toughest crowd, espe-
cially in the arts, like music and dancing.
It’s not often they have a black dude in
front of them playing electric guitar. I
closed my eyes, and they were yelling it
back at me. Everyone in the room was
sharing a special energy. My body shiv-
ered,” he remembers, shaking his shoul-

ders and leaning back. “I thought, ‘This is
a special thing, and I could do this for the
rest of my life.”’

After that, Williams focused most of
his energies into forming a band. A friend
gave him a drum set, and Williams bought
a bass guitar, PA system, and keyboard for
the band. Williams turned an empty dorm
suite into rehearsal space and called it the
Moon, after the incense they bumed there
during jam sessions.

He studied jazz guitar and joined the
African Drum Ensemble at Pitt, which
only had four members at the time.
Williams learned the polyrhythms of

often incorporated into popular music

in Blindsight’s unique sound.

Like other young entrepreneurs,
Williams has faced setbacks. However,
his early career success can be attributed

to his positive attitude. It comes through 1

in his music, which he describes as a “uni-
versal cosmic funky groove.”

“I want to shake up the world,” he
says, “by creating a festive environment. I
want people to feel good about them-
selves and the world and the energy that
exists in the reality that they’re living.”

His music is an answer to the ‘90s

musical and cultural trend toward the neg— —-

ative.

“With the whole Generation X thing
in the early ‘90s, it was cool to be dissat-
isﬁed. For grunge bands like Nirvana, it
wasn’t even cool to be successful.”

Music reﬂects what is happening in
society, but Williams couldn’t relate tothe
negativity.

“I came from a very happy home,” he
explains. “People used to think it was bad
that my parents were still married. People
were saying, ‘My life is shit, what are you
doing happy?”’

He acknowledges the negative side of ‘

things but says it depends on what you
choose to look at. He wants his music to
reach a worldwide, multicultural audi-
ence.

 

Williams started the Pittsburgh-based '

band Blindsight over four years ago and,
after conquering the local club circuit,
decided the next natural step was to
record.

The original Blindsight band mem-
bers parted with Williams early in the
recording process because of disagree-
ments with album producer Chyp Davis.
These disagreements forced Williams to
decide either to keep the band together or
to produce an album.

“Blindsight has been my baby from
the beginning, and I’d be damned tobe
held hostage by the band when we were
on the threshold of being recording
artists.”

By this point, the band was riding
high on its local success in Pittsburgh,
packing the city’s largest clubs like
Rosebud and Metropol. The premier of
the band’s video, “The Magical
Mystical,” which accompanied the
release of a demo tape of the same name,
set an attendance record at Club Cloud
Nine in late ‘95.

The demo had been recorded at
Audiomation on Pittsburgh’s North Side,
where Rusted Root had recorded prior to
attaining success on the national music
scene. Liz Berlin of Rusted Root had
offered Williams words of inspiration at
Blindsight’s first performance, when her
band was the biggest in Pittsburgh.

Blindsight extended its performance
circuit to Virginia and Ohio and appeared
in showcases in Memphis and New York.
They had just been voted “Band of the
Year” in the intemational/world-music

category in a March ‘96 issue of In
Pittsburgh . Williams knew the only
option was to go the next level, which
meant recording a CD. It was a natural
step for Williams in the progression of his
music. i

The tape had received local radio
play.

“It sounded cool as a demo,”
Williams says, “but for the level I wanted
to take the band, at that point I wasn’t
capable of accomplishing things on my
own.” None of Blindsight’s members had
experience in recording or producing a
CD.

Williams was eager to learn from
Davis, who had worked with famous acts

such as Earth, Wind, and Fire. When the.

rest of Blindsight was offended by Davis’
input into the album, they quit. T h e
band had been used to performing, which
meant they all played at the same time.
For the CD, Davis needed to bring out the
various elements of the music.

‘The music was buried,” Williams
explains. “There was a lot of" music under
the jamming we were doing. Chyp just
brought out what was already there.”

Williams realized that he and the
other band members were pursuing the
same dream.

At the same time, Williams’ music
was maturing.

“Songs from before started to have a
collective meaning to me,” he said. Even
the name Blindsight, which originated as
something that sounded cool for a band,
had evolved into a representation of the
music.

“It means an inward sight, or an
inward discovery of something your eyes
can’t see.” Williams explained.

Williams wanted to advance his
music to the next level without compro-
mising any of his artistic integrity.

The publishing company normally
receives royalties any time an artist’s
music gets played or a CD is sold. The
production company takes its share and
then splits the money with the record
label.

“The last person to get paid is the
artist, the bread and butter of the whole
thing,” Williams said.

By owning the publishing company,
under Winexsburg Productions, Williams
is responsible for distributing the royal-
ties. He also has control over what is done
with the music, which artists signed to a
label do not have. For example, the music
can be sold for use in a commercial,
video, or for radio airplay.

“The mistake that young bands make
is that they sign their lives away in lucra-
tive record deals when they’re shown all
this advanced cash. They’re not told that
it isn’t theirs, and they have to pay it back
to the record company,” Williams
explained.

“The record company owns you and
your music because they own your pub-
lishing rights.”

'l'I-IE PITT NEWS

Williams’ father had seen Blindsight
perform and agreed to help ﬁnance the
band’s CD because the younger Williams
was still paying off bills for instruments
and for recording the demo tape. The two
became partners in Winexsburg
Productions, and Williams’ father, who
owns 51 percent of the company, serves
as executive producer. Williams’ father
found Davis, who had been in the music
business for 30 years, to produce the CD.

With his own production company,
Lenny Williams thus can maintain control
of publication rights to his music and
record under his own label, Tamarack
Records. The label is named for the part
of Maryland where Williams grewup.

The younger Williams stepped into

 

unfamiliar territory when he decided to go
ahead with the recording plans without
his band.”

“It was a humbling position for me to
be in,” Williams said. “I was always the
one who bought the instruments and put
the people together.” His new band mem-
bers are in their 40s to 60s and have
played with acts like the Drifters and the
Coasters.

“I had never played with other peo—
ple, let alone professional musicians. I’m
this nobody.”

Williams already knew the irnmedi—
ate satisfaction of performing his music
live, from watching the audiences dance
and from the feelings he got on stage.
He’s learned that the recording process is

a whole different kind of satisfaction,
watching something start as an idea and
mature into a ﬁnished opus.

“I want people to realize the beauty
that exists within themselves, the world,
and become deeper within their own spir-
ituality,” Williams says. “Everyone on
this earth is unique and blessed with a gift
that no one else has. For some, it’s a piece
that gets connected with someone else’s.
It’s about sharing this energy and making
our collective existence explode. To me,
it’s the most important thing in the world
to get as many people as I can to discover
that. By putting that in the medium of
music, it could last forever and could be
passed on. Music transcends time, race,
even at the cosmic level.”

Course packets

Why pay an exorbitant
amount of money for a text-
book, of which you will only
use a portion, only to pay more
money for supplemental mater-
ial upon the request from a pro-
fessor?

Some students and staff
believe that course packets are
a less costly and more efficient
medium to use in class, and we
agree. _

Course packets consist of
materials which are assembled
by the professor, photocopied,
bound, and sold as one text.
They tend to be less expensive

than textbooks, as the price is
determined by the cost of copy-
right fees, rather than by the
market value of a factory manu-
factured book.

Course packets can be tai-
lored to a professor’s needs. If a
professor is teaching a course
on China, for example, and
wants you to understand the
political, social, economic, and

cultural structure, he may have

to require students to buy sev-
eral costly books in order to

   

sion and study purposes.
However, with a course -packet,
he can include various readings
from different sources that
cover everything he wants to
cover in class, much more inex-
pensively.

Professors need to look into
the viability of course packets
for their classes. Not only are
course packets generally more
cost-efficient for students, but
they allow a professor to pro-
vide a more dynamic and

have material for class discus-

are a less painful alternative to textbooks

teaching. Course packets allow
professors to tailor a class to
what they want to teach, rather
than to what is included in a
standard textbook.

Students should get togeth-
er and go in for course packets
together, making usage of pho-
tocopying to save their hard-
earned money for essentials,
like food.

Students and professors
alike should demand that
course packets be used to make
classes more educationally
enriching and more student and
professor friendly.

Pregnancy: It’s a woman's cross to bear

45

 

Women have always been
unequal to men in at least one way.
When they have sex, there is always
the possibility that they might
become pregnant. Of course, the man
involved may also be aware of this
consequence, but unless he’s one of
the more enlightened specimens (and
I believe they come in all shapes,
sizes, and political persuasions), he
doesn’t actually have to stick around
for the ﬁnal outcome in quite the
same way as she does. Pregnancy
can be ﬁne, of course; I have nothing
against pregnancy per se. It’s just the
fact’ that this rest-of-your-life com-
mitment to another person who starts
out small and sweet and simple gets
progressively larger, more expensive,
and complicated, is a fairly major
undertaking. And frankly, I don’t
think it’s much fun by yourself.

Don’t get me wrong, I loved
being pregnant (eating, sleeping, and
bothering my head with nothing
more pressing than pink or blue
booties, lace frills, or rainbow rib-
bons). I really liked the part right after
the diﬂicult bit when you hold your
newborn in your arms and look into
that tiny, serious little face and know
she’s yours. And she looks right back
in total puzzlement. (Where am I,
and who are you?) It’s pretty far out.
Then, you get to lie around, and
everyone makes a big fuss over you,

and you stagger about wearing a new
nightie and a bemused smile.
Horribly spoiled and sickeningly
bourgeoisie was my lucky experi-
ence of pregnancy and childbirth. I’d
do it over again in a second. (Except
not really just at the moment, I’m
kind of busy.)

It wasn't like that for my girl-
friend, Lisa. She got pregnant, acci-
dentally sort of, to a very handsome

  

brings presents and wine and fruit, -

house painter she had met in her local
bar and dated for about two months.
She was 30 and had lost the love her
life some ﬁve years previously, I

know she still missed him, but I .

believe she decided that her biologi-
cal clock was ticking and she’d take
her chances. Something about the
fact that he never called again after
she told him the news, and that he
went around the neighborhood
swearing to whomever would listen
that it wasn’t his, told her that her
chances for anything other than the
baby she wanted weren’t looking so
good.

Lisa had a little more on her
mind during her pregnancy than bon-
bons and booties. She didn’t get any
afternoon naps or shopping trips for
cute, stylish pregnancy clothes and
tiny little white lace comforter sets
with tiny little pink and blue bows on
them. She just got up at six in the
morning as usual and caught the bus
to her job as a secretary in Pittsburgh.
She had to, for the health insurance.

About two weeks before my due
date, my husband’s buddy from
Seattle was in town. We were all at a
Labor Day party when my back start-
ed to ache, so I drove home at about
10 p.m., leaving them to drink and
debauch in their customary male-
bonding style. I drove back to my
mother-in—law’s house and walked
around the house, hoping my back
would soon feel better. It didn’t. I just
kept walking: living room, kitchen,
conservatory, back porch, front
porch, bathroom. My mother-in-law
ﬁnally showed up around midnight
and viewed me sharply with her pro-
fessional statf-nurse’s eye. “It’s just a
backache. I’ll be ﬁne. It’s probably
false labor, right?” I said, as I tried out
various odd postures —— leaning
against the wall while touching my
toes — to ease my aching back
“Hmm,” she said. “Where’s
Shawn?”

He ﬁnally showed up at six am.
reeking of beer, bleary-eyed, and
with his buddy staggering along
behind him, both of them giggling
like schoolgirls. I ﬁnally managed to
make him understand that I didn’t
want to lie down and take a nap with
him right then, or drink a beer and
relax, or smoke a joint, or even walk
around any more, so he eventually
got it together and drove (rather well,
I think, although I was a little preoc-
cupied) to the hospital on deserted
Sunday-moming—after—Labor-Day
roads. I think it was cloudy. We drove
home triumphantly three days later
with our beautiful china—doH daugh-
terallwrappedupinwhitelaceand
pink ribbons.

Lisa’s friend, Sue, took her to the
hospital, and I picked her up. Of
course, we girls had all been there at
various times during her labor, and
her sister held her hand during her
delivery — a C-section after 48
hours of struggle. I dropped her and
Jacob off at her apartment, and then I
had to go straight off to work I
thought of Lisa’s, in six short weeks,
going back to work, leaving tiny
defenseless Jacob in day care, getting
up and down the apartment steps
with the stroller and Jacob and the
groceries at seven o’clock on a
December evening, struggling with
her purse and Jacob’s things, tired
after working all day, eating a
microwave dinner, and hoping to get
some sleep before having to get up
and do it all again. I felt guilty for
thinking these things as I drove to
work, like it's disloyal to women to
think they can't do it by themselves,
or that they need a man. But that’s not
the point. Of course they can do it by
themselves. But the point is, would
you want to?

p.x taylor thinks women can do any-
thing by themselves, but sometimes
its easier with a little help from our

friends.

Conspirac theorists are generally paranoid crackpots

.j_.Q.’,>.,. .,._.(. ._.'.,

 
 

Everywhere you go today, it is diffi-
cult to get away from one inescapable fact:
Our government is a den of corruption,
depravity, and lies. Turn on the television.
On Sunday night you can watch “The X-
Files,” the story of how two lone FBI
agents named Mulder and Scully bravely
battle evil elements within the federal gov-
emment and attempt to prove that the
“truth is out there.” Want to go to the
movies? From Absolute Power to Murder

, at 1600 to the upcoming Conspiracy

Theory, our government is up to its neck
covering up murder, or .
worse, by those at the high- '
est levels. '

I’ve heard literally
dozens of conspiracy theo-
ries. The idea that Lee

JFK is just the most
famous “example” of our
govemment’s “lying” to
us. Others include the
alleged government culpa-
bility in the Martin Luther
King assassination, the

" supposed cover-up of the alien landing at

Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, and the
claim made by right-wing kooks that

* White House aide Vince Foster was killed

by Bill Clinton’s family to conceal crimes
that Clinton committed while governor of

 

 

Arkansas (alas, I am neglecting dozens of
others). The most recent illustration of a
government conspiracy is the theory put
forward by former JFK Press Secretary
Pierre Salinger that a U.S. Navy cruiser
shot down TWA ﬂight 800 with a missile
during a training exercise.

Distrust of the government is a perva-
sive feeling across most of the United
States. Back in 1963 (during the time
Salinger was working in the White
House), 74 percent of the American peo-
ple said that they “tnist the government to
do the right thing all or most of the time.”
Today just 24 percent of the public feels
the same way. Seventy-ﬁve percent of
Americans think that our
government is involved in
conspiracies, and another
20 percent actually believe
Salinger’s theory is right.
Columnist Jonathan Alter
noted in Newsweek : “The
post-cold war battle lines
are finally being drawn. In
place of socialism versus
capitalism, it’s conspirator-
ial versus non—conspiratori-
al: people who think most
bad things can be explained
by bad people working together in brilliant
secrecy versus people who think the

human condition is to talk too much and L

screw things up.” In case you can’t tell,
I’m in the latter camp.
I agree. It would take extraordinary

unity to hold together, in total secrecy, a
conspiracy like the shooting down of
TWA ﬂight 800. The crew of the cruiser,
about 300 sailors, have not breathed a
word since last summer 
about their role in the 
tragedy. Nor have any other 
people in the Navy who 
would have investigated the 
incident or gotten wind of 
it. I like “The X-Files” for 
its entertaimnent value, but 
I ﬁnd it faintly ridiculous, ,
because it is impossible for 
all of the things that need to 
happen in a conspiracy to
happen in such utterly per-
fect secrecy. As Jonathan
Alter pointed out in his arti-
cle, the odds that not one of those 300 peo-
ple aboard the Navy cruiser would not
spill the. beans to the media for big bucks
and fame, or because he or she has a guilty
conscience and wants to come to grips
with his or her responsibility for killing so
many people, is just about nil. We live in
an age when it is diﬂicult — thanks to
technology and the intemet — to shut up a
person who wants to make their voice
heard. Someone would have talked.
Unfortunately, the paradox is that to
many conspiracy theorists, the lack of evi-
dence is the very sign of a conspiracy.
Every time the government comes out and
disproves a conspiracy theory with simple
logic, the conspiracy people become even

 

 

more convinced of the validity of their
arguments. A coincidence becomes the
sign that a conspiracy is at fault. In June
1995, a member of the Montana Militia
informed Senator Herb
Kohl about the existence of
government weather—tam-
pering machines, saying:
“If someone had told me
that equipment even exist-
ed 10 years ago, I would
have thought they were
nuts, sir. And at this point
in time, we have all the
documents to prove it. And
if you think that 85 toma-
does take place in the mid-
dle of our growing area by
simultaneous accident, I’m
sony.” You heard him right: govemment
weather-tampering systems.

So, with the new millennium fast
approaching, be on the lookout for a rise in
the number of people talking about the end
of the world and the dirty little secrets that
our government supposedly has in the
closet. For every 100 or 200 conspiracy
theories, maybe one actually has some
credence. Conspiracy theories have
become easy ways for people to clarify
problems or issues that defy a simple
explanation. My advice: Don’t believe
them.

Michael Berquist thinks that people ought
to remember that “The X—Files” is just a
TVshow.

USSA trip was about
American activism, not
bureaucratic b.s.‘

America was founded on the funda-
mental ideal of the activist. It was the
activist who fought for America’s inde-
pendence, and it was the activist who
fought for racial equality. In a recent
series of Pitt News’ articles, the United
States Student Association has been
accused of being a “breeding ground for
bureaucrats,” but I beg to differ. USSA
is based on the ideal that higher educa-
tion should be made available to all
who seek its rewards. Every time you
sign those loan papers or utilize that
Pell grant, this is another victory for
USSA. Every time a student of color or
varied sexual preference enters college
without being affected by society’s
prejudice, USSA knows that it is doing
its job. As a delegate to the USSA leg-
islative conference, I was not taught the
science of political corruption, but

rather the art of activism. I did not visit
Washington, D.C., as a tourist, but as a
lobbyist. Delegates attended countless
seminars, lectures, and political caucus-
es lasting from nine in the morning to,
at times, midnight. The USSA and these
legislative delegates carried the con-
cerns and interests of over 3 million stu-
dents to Capitol Hill. This is not the
bending of ideals to the bureaucracy,
this is the bending of the bureaucracy to
our ideals. The “art of activism” is
found in the ability to not only realize
the faults in the system, but ﬁght to cor-
rect these faults. The Pitt News has
falsely reported on an event that they
themselves promised, but failed, to
attend. Instead, they have taken it upon
themselves to trivialize an extremely
noteworthy event. I urge The Pitt News
and its editorial staff to consider the
whole event and the whole organization
before printing a story. I urge The Pitt
News to join us at the 50th Anniversary
USSA Congress in Madison, Wis., to
see activism in the making. But mostly,
I urge Pitt students to follow the exam-

ple of USSA and fight for students’
rights. Call your congressman, call your
representative, or call the student-gov-
ernment ofﬁce. Lead, follow, or get out
of the way.

Pro-choice means explor-
ing all the options, not
just abortion

On December 13, 1996, my girl-
friend had an abortion.

Supposed “pro-choice” friends of
hers told her to have an abortion; that
not having it would ruin her life; that it
was the right thing for her to do. These
same people told her not to listen to any-
one else’s opinion and told me to stay
out of it and let her make up her own
mind. Unfortunately, because this is the

“politically correct” thing to do, I fol-
lowed this advice. This advice ignores
the fact that a woman may make a deci-
sion based upon what her partner wants.
My girlfriend did what she did for a lot
of reasons, but one of the main ones was
that she felt like I didn’t want to have the
baby. Why did she feel this way?
Because I felt like I wasn’t supposed to
tell her what I wanted. “Pro-choice”. cru-
saders are fond of using phrases like,,“If

you’re against an abortion, don’t have '

one.” Yet, can someone who supports
abortion on demand and feels that thlere
is nothing wrong with it truly be pro-
choice when faced with a friend who
doesn’t know how to deal with her
unwanted pregnancy? I’m not sure any-
more. The true pro-choice position
would have been to support whatever
decision she chose, and not to try to
inﬂuence her to decide one way or the
other. Not a single person suggested that
she have the baby, or even acted like it

was a reasonable choice.

A Tiger's
taIe....

 

I am Tiger Woods.

p Well, no. In fact, I’m not even
close.

A And despite what the ad execu-
lives at Nike might like you to
believe, nobody else is close, either.

l This guy is amazing.

Last weekend, Woods shattered
every record that the Masters had to
offer, breaking seven marks and tying
two others in an l8—under—par exhibi-
tion. He beat the field by 12 strokes.

e shot more birdies and eagles than
p NRA member could in the middle of
;a wildlife preserve.

Without exaggeration, and with
apologies to Michael Jordan, Woods
is the most dynamic, most talented
rookie to grace the sports scene since
}Willie Mays in 1951.

In the coming days, there will be
a lot of pressure on the young Tiger to
put his celebrity toward the social
good. He’ll be asked to do stay—in—
school messages, anti—drug cam-
paigns, and charity golf events.
Activists and ad reps will want Woods
to bring the game to the minority
eommunity that it has so long
ignored. V

People will think Woods is golf’s
messiah.

‘ He isn’t. And expecting him to be
a savior or a bridge from golf ’s segre-
gated past to integrated harmony is
only going to make his already stress-
ful situation worse. '

_ At 2], Woods is not ready to be a
public figure, much less a public

to play golf. Nothing else, just golf.

Being a full-time student is a
heavy responsibility, which could
be why only 20 percent of people
that begin college actually gradu-
ate. '

Being a full-time athlete is an
equally heavy burden, but when
hundreds of young adults put in
time and effort to play both of
these roles, they deserve recogni-
tion.

“This is an outstanding group
of young student—athletes,” said
Athletic Director Steve Pederson.
“Not only have they been success-
ful in the classroom, but on the
playing fields and courts as well.

 
 

We are sad to see them leave, but
we know that their future endeav-
ors will be great ones.”

Tuesday night at the William
Pitt Union Ballroom the senior stu-
dent—ath1etes were honored for
their years of dedicated service to
the University of Pittsburgh com-
munity.

Although the banquet is meant
for the entire group of senior ath-
letes, a few of these students got to
bask in the limelight for what
could be the last time. ‘

Fifty—one student-athletes were
honored at the banquet, including
19 members of Pitt’s 1997

The Pitt crew team races down a chann

 

‘MB

to ographer

el near Washington's Landing during their competition on Saturday.

Crew keeps treading through rough waters

 

“Row, row, row your boat, strongly
down the Allegheny.”

This version of the old ditty is
somewhat different than the one famil-
iar to most Pitt students, but it is the
standard for the Pitt crew team.

Last weekend, the crew team was
on the water both Saturday and Sunday,
first in Ohio, then here at home in
Pittsburgh.

On Saturday, they were in Ohio
competing at Marietta College. Five
schools entered teams in the various
competitions. Because of the differing

composition of the boats, not all of the
schools had teams in every competi-
tion.

There are three categories of com-
petition, each of which depends on the
number of rowers in the boat, the level
of the rowers’ experience, and the
weight of the rowers.

The weight categories are divided
into light- and heavyweight rowers. For
men, lightweight rowers are 160
pounds or less, while for women the
weight is 130 pounds or less. There is
no upper limit for heavyweights.
Novice rowers are those who are in
their first year of rowing; varsity rowers
are those who have more than a year of

rowing.

The other category is based on how
many rowers are in the boat. There are
four- and eight—man boats, which have
ﬁve and nine people, respectively. The
extra man is not actually a rower but the
coxswain, who calls out commands to
the crew. The women’s—eight boat has a
male coxswain, while the men’s eight
has a female coxswain. So, a women’s-
eight—novice—lightweight boat would
have nine people in the boat: eight row-
ers, each under 130 pounds and in their
first year of rowing, and one coxswain.

Although these coxswains may
seem like dead weight, they serve an

CREW, PAGE row

 

Crew:  

important purpose.

“Hopefully, they’re the lightest per-
son, so that they aren’t much dead
weight. They motivate you. They help
keep you focused, and they steer the
boat,” said Mandy Shultz, a rower and
the treasurer of the club.

Pitt’s teams took ﬁrst place in four
competitions. Pitt’s women’s—novice
eight team beat Ohio, Cincinnati, and
Marietta with a time of 6 minutes 43
seconds. The men’s junior—varsity—1ight—

weight four beat out Marietta,
Charleston, and Cincinnati. The
women’s—novice four beat out

I Cincinnati in a two—way race, and the

women’s—lightweight four beat Marietta
and Charleston.

“We were racing against good com-
petition,” said Women’s Coach Greg
Egnor. “These were all champion
boats.”

On Sunday, the Pitt crew was in a
channel near the boathouse on
Washington’s Landing, due to rough
waters. The races were still run. Pitt
competed against John Carroll and Case
Western (both from Cleveland),
Duquesne, and Camegie—Mellon. Pitt
didn’t fare as well this time, taking first
in only two races.

The Pitt crew beat out John Carroll
and Case Western in the men’s—varsity
eight with a time of 2 minutes 27 sec-
onds. The men’s-novice eight defeated

'l'l'lE PITT NEWS

Carroll, and the women’s—varsity eight
ran a close second to John Carroll, being
beaten by only four seconds.

“The first couple of weeks of the
season have been good,” Egnor said.
“They’re racing stiff competition. I think

the competition is
making [the women’s-
varsity eight] faster.”

The training that
the rowers go through
is intense and year-
long.

“We work all year
round,” Martin said.
“We have a summer
program to keep in
shape. Then in the fall
we have an intensive
workout.”

From that point,
they work out six
mornings a week and
two afternoons. They
spend as much time as
possible on the water,
until the waters get too rough, usually
around Thanksgiving, according to
Martin. The afternoon workouts consist
of dry-land activities such as running,
using rowing machines, weight training,
and running the 36 ﬂights of the
Cathedral of Learning’s steps.

“It takes a special kind of person to
last through winter training,” Martin

 

said.

Many of the teams that Pitt com-
petes against are varsity teams, which
puts Pitt’s club team at a slight disad-
vantage. According to Egnor, many
schools made women’s crew a varsity
sport in order to com-
ply with Title IX regu-
lations. This allows the
other schools to spend

more money and
recruit more heavily
for the sport.

Crew is an expen-
sive sport for those
who want to row here
at Pitt. Every member
must pay $130 in dues
and contribute to
mandatory fundraising
efforts. ‘

“We’ve had many
people who have had
to quit because they
couldn’t afford it,” said
Merry Martin, the
women’s—eight captain.

Currently, the team is allocated no
money for competition. Despite that,
there could be drawbacks if the
University were to make crew a varsity
sport. Under NCAA rules, varsity teams
are not allowed to fundraise. So, if Pitt
were to make crew a varsity sport on the
order of football and not allocate it

Wednesday, April ‘I6, 1997

FROM PAGE 9

enough money, the teams would be

worse off.
With the harsh training and disad-
vantages, it is enough to ask why the

team members do it.

“There’s nothing quite like the feel-
ing of giving it all you’ve got and
accomplishing something with your
boat,” Martin said.

Shultz agreed that the teamwork
was an important factor.

“I’m the kind‘ of person that likes
organizations that pull together for a
common cause, and you really get that
from crew.” -

This motivation seemed to be the
same for the male rowers.

“It’s like Buddhism on the water.
You give it everything you got and push
yourself with the team. There’s nothing
like being out there with these people,”
said David Teeters, a men’s crew mem-
ber.

Next weekend, the crew teams will
begin their championship season with
the Murphy Cup race in Philadelphia.
From there, the season will build to a cli-
max at Dad Vails, also held in
Philadelphia.

Teeters said that any Pitt students
from Philadelphia should be sure to stop
by the Pitt trailer on May 9 and 10.

“It’s quite an event,” Teeters said.
“Students and alumni come out, and
there is a party around the trailer.”

E|No,

I don’t want to subscribe to The Pitt
News. Who needs your crappy little
left-wing editorials, your little Tiekwood

comic strip, with your mud-slinging stories on the SGB versus the

Allocations Committee. Frankly I’m sick and tired of hearing about

student apathy and the rude service or bad meals at the cafeterias,
university budget cuts, and your “controversial” reports on the Ku
Klux Klan. Why don’t you leave things alone? Why subscribe to
something that is more tabloid than hard news and used as
entertainment by students to get through boring classes at Pitt!

Angels break even at Classic

Fales, Kluse pace Pitt womens’ rugby

Eric Knopsnyder
Z.-:3:-:-.a..  -.<3‘.- .- ' 

The Pittsburgh Angels Women’s
Rugby Club split a pair of games at the
Ohio Classic this weekend in what was
possibly their best performance of the
year.

The Angels drew North Shore, a
club team from Chicago, in the ﬁrst
round of the tournament. The‘Angels
played tough defensively, but they
struggled to move the ball in the 5-0
loss.

“We played pretty much as well as
you can play a team,” said Angels
Coach Tim Nestor. “They just had the
horses.”

Angel Idi Okilo was impressed by
the team’s performance. “I thought it
was the best we’ve ever played,” she
said. “We held them off defensively.
We’ve never played that well defensive-
ly. We’re usually an offensive team.”

Lori Altenderfer also liked the
Angels’ effort. “I think it’s the best game
we’ve played this year,” she said. “We
held our own against their forwards. We
managed to hold them off. For us to
only lose 5-0 was pretty good.”

The Angels’ offense was held in
check by North Shore’s bigger, more
experienced team.

“They were a solid team,” said

Nestor. “They had big forwards. We
didn’t get enough good ball to score. We
didn’t get a good opportunity.”

The Angels got plenty of opportuni-
ties in their second game, however, as
they faced Louisville, who had been
beaten 67-0 in their ﬁrst—round match.

Samantha Fales and Kim Kluse
helped the Angels jump out to a 21-0
halftime lead on their way to a 26-10
victory.

Fales ended with three tries, and
Erin O’Connell was successﬁil in three
of four conversions attempts.

“Our backs did a good jo ,” said
Nestor. “We got to open it up a little bit.”

“We shouldn’t have let them score
the two tries,” said Altenderfer. “They
had some experience, but I just didn’t
think they were very good.”

The game did allow the Angels the

opportunity to gain some experience, as

everybody got to play.

Okilo was reluctant, however, to
place the blame on the Angels’ substitu-
tions for Louisville’s having scored as
many points as it did. “That should not
have affected the game tremendously,”
she said. “Substituting three players
should not have made a dilference.
Louisville also picked up a few players
they didn’t have in the ﬁrst game. We
just made a few mistakes, and those
players capitalized on it.”

the delivery room, he two-putted out
and completed the back nine at three
under before the doctor slapped him.

Anyway, thanks to some bizarre
yet effective upbringing, Woods has
been playing golf all of his life.
Naturally, some things had to be sacri-
ficed: success in school, some social
activities, and a childhood, among
others.

He was raised a golfing machine,
and has so far lived up to the billing.

Now kids want to be like him, and
they want Tiger to show them how.

Nike is taking advantage of this
by marketing golf equipment to
younger players. Tiger’s father is tak-
ing advantage of this by publishing a
book explaining his child—rearing tac-
tics —— a blessing to fathers who feel
the need to live out athletic fantasies
through their unwilling children.

But what can Tiger say?

If he tells kids that they need to
stay in school to be successful, how
does he explain dropping out of
Stanford after two years?

If he tells kids that they need ded-
ication to be successful, how does he
explain skipping over a month’s worth
of tournaments in his first year as a
pro and complaining about exhaus-
tion?

If he tells kids that they can be
anything, including golf pros, will this

help poor children better afford clubs,
bags, lessons, and membership fees?
Can it make up for the lack of parental
support that most of these kids will
have to deal with?

Again, we have the Mays parallel.
In the ‘50s, when Willie was tearing
up the majors with a never—before—
seen mix of power and speed, he was
cast as the new model for minority
youth. But, he had never worked a day
in his life, he’d never paid much atten-
tion to schoolwork, and he’d never
excelled at anything but athletics.

He was not a savior. This was best
explained by the Mays basket catch ——
it worked for him, but he wouldn’t
teach it to anybody else because it
wouldn’t work for them.

Woods is the same way. Tiger
can’t explain his success. It’s part
God—given talent, part dominating
father figure. There is nothing he can
share as an activist or a celebrity that
will further the game.

All he can do is be one of history’s
greatest golfers for as long as he can.
After he grows up, maybe he can
become an activist or a spokesman,
but for now, he’s just Tiger Woods.

And you’re not, no matter what
the commercial says.

editor of The Pitt News.
