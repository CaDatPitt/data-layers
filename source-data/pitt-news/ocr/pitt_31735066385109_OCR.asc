Cold weather greets participants of 1988 GreatRace

An estimated 14,000 men and women ran in yesterday's Great Race, dedicated to the late mayor, Richard Caliguiri.

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

Thousands of Pittsburghers
lined the streets to cheer on the
estimated 14,000 Great Race run-
ners yesterday.

The 10—kilometer (6.2 miles)
race began on Beechwood
Boulevard near the Homewood
cemetery and finished at Point
State Park.

The Great Race was held in the
memory of the late mayor

Richard Caliguiri, who was the
founder of the Great Race. Speak-
ing at the awards ceremony at
Point State park, Mayor Sophie
Masloff said, ”l’ll always remem-
ber Richard Caliguiri as my
mayor.” The mayor also added
that the cash prizes for the best
runners ”make runners not want
to run fast, but first.”

The race was divided up into
three main groups, which were
the Challenged Division consist-
ing of handicapped participants;

the_Master’s Division, comprised
of runners aged 40 and older; and
the top 12 male and female
runners. .

New course records were set
this year by Betty Geiger of
Raleigh, N.C. (31 :07), who cut 90
seconds off her time from last
year's race and who also set a
new U.S. record with her new
time. Geiger took first place in the
top 12 female competitors eche-
lon. The former female course

- record was Maureen Custy’s time

of 32:37.

Are Nakkim of Boston, Mass.,
took first place for the men's
category with his time of 27:46,
which beat the former male
record of 28:04 set by Greg
Beardsley in 1985.

Both Geiger and Nakkim
received a $1,000 bonus for set-
ting new course records in addi—
tion to their $5,000 prize for
placing first.

A new prize was created this
year, the Richard S. Caliguiri

Curt Wachter/The Pitt News

Award, which was given to the
first two Pittsburghers to cross the
finish line. Pittsburgher Susan
Wagner finished with a time of

38:14, and Eric Wilkins, also

from Pittsburgh, had a time of
38:39.

Prizes in merchandise totaling
$2,000 were awarded to the top
three male and female runners in

V 12 age groups ranging from 17 to

70. The top 50 runners each
received merchandise totalling

University tries to deal with foriegn T.A. linguistic problems

By Suzanne Sabol and

Tracey Yossa
For The Pitt News /

In a cultural center such as the
University of Pittsburgh, foreign
names and faces are common-
place in the front of the class-
room. Often comes the difficulty
of deciphering the lecture
through a thick foreign accent.

’’I needed help with a com-
puter program last term," said
Stephen McGanty, a mechanical
engineering student/and when I
went to the T.A., his accent was
so thick that I couldn't under-
stand his explanation.”

Not understanding a foreign
T.A., is a frustrating situation en—

countered by many Pitt students,
but there is a program available
that works to alleviate the
problem.

Pitt's English Language Institute
requires all foreign T.A.s in the
College of Arts and Sciences and
business and engineering depart-
ments to be tested for English
speaking and comprehensive
skills.

Poor performance on the test
will result in the T.A. being
placed in a three-credit course to
help improve his command of
the English language. While en-
rolled in the class, the T.A.s are
assigned non—teaching assign-
ments such as grading.

Instructor Joe Sukenik teaches

a class on pronunciation skills
and includes idioms that the T.A.s
may run into, such as ”to blow
off a class,’’ ”to ace an exam” or
”to flunk out.” 1
According to Marie Eichler of
the department of linguistics, this
course helps the foriegn T.A.s
”understand the cultural differ-
ences in America as well as im-
prove their speaking skills.”
Undergraduates are invited to
attend this class so the T.A.s can
see what American students are
really like. They are involved in
ro|e—playing to simulate class-
room situations. Eichler said, ’’It
should be fun. It's like impromp-
tu acting.” There are situations in-
volving a student asking for more

time on a project or for a grade
change. Eichler adds that the stu-
dents also get the chance to be
disruptive. ”We have people
singing, talking, jingling their
keys and telling jokes to see how
the T.A.s deal with problems like
these."

If any students are interested in
participating in the class, they can
Contact the linguistics
department.

After -the T.A.s complete the
class, they are evaluated again. If
they still have some difficulty
speaking they can receive tutor-
ing from the department of lin-
guistics.

The T.A.s who pass the class,
as well as those who received in-

termediate scores on the initial
test, are permitted to teach.
However, they are required to at-
tend four non-credit tutoring ses-
sions. The tutor may videotape
presentations from a T.A. and
may visit the classroom to check
on the progress made.

Also helpful in spotting
problems with foreign T.A.s are
the surveys passed out each term
by the Office for the Evaluation
of Teaching.

These surveys are given to each
student in an undergraduate
class, with two extra questions
concerning speaking and com-
prehension skills for foreign
T.A.s. This calls..,attention to defi-

Bush and Dukakis confront issues in debate

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP)
— George Bush and Michael
Dukakis. clashed over deficits,
drugs and the Pledge of Allegi-
ance in a crackling campaign de-
bate Sunday night. Bush said, ’’I
hope people don't think I'm
questioning his patriotism,” but
Dukakis said he was and added,
’’I resent it.”

Republican Bush said the
voters want change but contend-
ed, ”We are the change, I am the
change.” He said the nation
doesn't want ‘to return to the
”malaise” of the Carter adminis-
tration. -

Dukakis, the son of immigrants,
said he wants to make the Ameri-
can dream come true for all
citizens. ”The best America is not
behind us. The best America is
yet to come.”

The combatants in a close race
for the White House also argued
defense policy before an au-
dience of a few thousand people
in the Wait Chapel at Wake
Forest University and tens of mil-
lions of television viewers.

’ Each man used his two—minute
closing statement to deliver a ver-
sion of his standard campaign
speech.

Discovery liftoff
could be Thursday

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
— NASA postponed the start of
the countdown for space shuttle
Discovery by eight hours Sunday
because of lagging preparations
but still aimed for a Thursday
morning liftoff.

”We’re still on the timeline for
launch on the 29th, and that's the
plan,” said launch director Bob
Sieck.

The countdown was resche-
duled to begin at 8 a.m. EDT
Monday for the first manned
American space flight since the
Challenger blew up over the At-
lantic 32 months ago.

The space agency had added
27 unprogrammed hours to the
countdown as insurance for last-
minute problems, and Sieck said
eight hours of that time would be
used in advance to complete the
work of replacing panels and
work platforms.

the way doctors are paid, sharply
reducing fees for many kinds of
operations while raising charges
for office visits.

The study has been the obiect
of intense speculation and appre-
hension in the medical world
since it was undertaken two years
ago by economist William C.
Hsiao of the Harvard University
School of Public Health.

The massive project attempts to
determine the amount of work in-
volved in everything doctors do
—— from checkups and well—baby
visits to brain surgery and coro-
nary bypasses —— so they can be
paid what their services are
worth.

Lower cholesterol

egg gets second look

NEW HOLLAND, Pa. (AP) -
Lowered-cholesterol eggs have
health-conscious consumers
clucking about their effect on im-
proved diets, but researchers say
the improvement over regular
eggs may not be all it is cracked
up to be.

Department of Agriculture

researchers have analyzed some
of the eggs labeled ”lowered
cholesterol” and verified that the
levels are less than what USDA
guidelines say an average egg
contains.

The USDA rates the level of
cholesterol in an average large
egg at 274 milligrams. Research-
ers confirmed that at least one
Pennsylvania producer’s
lowered—cho|estero| eggs have 20
percent less than that, which is
the minimum reduction needed
to qualify for a lowered cholester-
ol label under proposed Food
and Drug Administration
guidelines.

Experts concerned
over swapped child

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)
—- Adoption experts agree that a
Florida girl is facing trauma, even
if a Pennsylvania couple are
wrong in their suspicions that she
is their natural child, swapped for
another soon after birth.

”Whatever happens, this kid is

going to pay the price,” said Fort
Lauderdale adoption counselor
C.J. Rader.

International librarians plead for world informational unity

By Jessica C0viIle
Staff Writer

This past weekend, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh's School of
Library and Information Science
held a conference entitled
”Translating an International Edu-
cation to a National, En-
vironment.”

This is the first major interna-
tional student conference in the
library and information science
field since 1969, and the first stu-
dent organized meeting ever held
in the United States.

Participants in this weekend's
conference included students and
visiting scholars from many coun-

tries: Saudia Arabia, Ethiopia,
Nicaragua, Israel, Brasil, Finland,
Indonesia, United States and
Korea were among the 23 coun-
tries represented.

The conference was con-
ceived, planned and organized
by the SLIS Doctoral Guild of Pitt
in cooperation with SLIS Interna-
tional Students Organization with
the SLIS Alumni. Julie Tallman,
president of the SLIS Doctoral
guild committee and chief plan-
ner of the conference said, ”We
see ourselves as being the access
keys, the tools and knowledge,
and lifelong learning for our
populations we serve.”

The conference included semi-

nars by doctoral students and
candidates that ranged from such
topics as ”Perspectives on the

V 9

   
 

  

Education Transfer Process” to
”Educating for Universal Library
and Informational Science.”
Dr. Anthony Debons, Professor
Emeritus from the University of
Pittsburgh, delivered a speech on
problems that international stu-
dents face in diverse cultures,
particularly focusing on the cog-
nitive learning process. Debons
said, ”The business in being an
international student is a human
affair, not an academic one. All
human affairs are a matter of un-
derstanding between both those
who teach and those who Iearn.”
Nearly 15 percent of Pitt's SLIS
student body is from outside the
United States. One such student

9 9 9

is Joseph B. Ojiambo, who is
originally from Kenya. Ojiambo
is a doctoral candidate and was
the chairman of the conference

committee. His multi-facetted‘

background includes schooling
in the United Kingdom, Germa-
ny and Helsinki, Finland.

Of the goals for the doctoral

program Tallman said, ”We hope '

that perhaps somebody following
us in the program can renew this
conference, if not annually, then
frequently, because we are very
excited about the networking and
the bringing together of interna-

tional students. It's a wonderful

prospect.”

Students spend spare time in center

By Erin Flynn

For The Pitt News

The recreational room in the
lower level of the William Pitt

- Union provides entertainment for

students with some extra time.
The rec-room includes facilities
such as ping-pong, table tennis,

’ 12 billiard tables, a jukebox, and

an arcade.

On the walls of the rec-room
are a number of awards that were
given to students in recognition

of excellence by the Association I

of College Unions International.
Some of the Pitt -students who

BROTHERS DUNLAP

have received awards are Jodi
Weisburg for Women's Billiards,
Robert Alman for Men's Bowling,
Ralph Jones for backgammon,
and in 1985, John McKibben
won the first-place award in the
intercollegiate tournaments for
backgammon.

Rick Herrnberger, a senior at
Pitt who has been the house
manager since the spring term,
said, ”Approximately 100 stu-
dents come here each day. It's
also very beneficial to com-
muters. It gives them something
to do between classes.”

The recreational room is usual-

 

ly crowded from 12 to 4 p.m. on
weekdays and from 8 to 9 p.m.
on Fridays and Saturdays.

Jim Habib, a junior at Pitt and
the weekend rec-room attendant
said, ’’I notice the regulars that
come in here on a daily basis.”

’’I come in here every day,”
said one student.”Ihave a lot of
friends here.”

Avy Patel, who comes to the
rec-room every evening, said,
”You have to know your limits,
though. Students see others play-
ing pool and try to get as good as
them. They spend so much time

$1,000'as Finisher’s prizes. The
top 12 male and female runners
each received prizes ranging
from $100 to $5,000.’
Sponsored by Citiparks, KDKA-
TV and KDKA Radio, the 12th an-
nual Great Race occurred under
grey clouds which threatened
rain. Temperatures were in the

50s, and the humidity was 90 J

percent, which some runners
liked and others didn't.

Jennifer Cargyll from Colorado,
who finished seventh with a time
of 32:10, said, ’’I ran with a cold,
but I knocked a minute off of my
time from last year's race.” Susan
Faber from Connecticut placed
12th with a time of 33:09. ”This
is the first time that I've raced in
Pittsburgh. I really enjoyed my-
self. This is a very beautiful city.”

City paramedics were on sta-
tion throughout the race course
to provide assistance. Fresh fruit
and refreshments were provided
at Point State Park, as a local
band called Cruise Control treat-
ed the crowd with some lively
jazz.

The Westinghouse running
team won the Competing Cor-
porate Team award with a com-
bined time of 94 minutes. The

cross country team from Shady— _

side Academy ran the race just for
the fun of it (literally — they all
affected clown wigs and fake

Reason needed to /\n0therTV chi

save memorial hall  

,The board of managers of Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall has re-
cently stated that the building will have to close its doors in Novem-

ber due to a lack of funds.

' For the past two years, the memorial_’s board ofmanagers and the
county commissioners have reached little agreement involving the
proper procedures in operating the memorial. The board now claims
the commissioners are hindering its ability to produce rental revenue
by failing to provide the memorial with enough maintenance staff.

Commissioners’ Chairman Tom Foerster’ was quoted in Friday's
Pittsburgh Press, calling the board's threat topclose the hall ”dumb

and stupid.” Ditto.

Soldiers & Sailors Memorial is a publicly supported facility; its board
seems to have forgotten this when it took the liberty to suggest clos-

ing it from the taxpayers.

The memoria|’s lack of funds isonly a symptom of a larger com-
munication problem. The board has claimed that it alone has the right
to run the hall, and this childish attitude serves only as an obstacle

in reaching successful solutions.

Joseph Puligini, Veterans’ Affairs director, has offered a plan to move
his office to the hall from the Strip District and to transfer program-
ming in the facility's auditorium to the county's Bureau of Cultural

usage of the facility.

Programs. Both of these suggestions would improve exposure and

It appears the county does not intend to give up on the hall as easi-
ly as the board of managershave. Though more money could help
the board, it is not the only solution. I .

It is estimated that only 25 to 35 people visit Soldiers & Sailors
Memorial each day. This cannot be attributed to lack of funds.

If the memorial is to function successfully, its board must be able _

to work with those who benefit from it — the public.

The scene: Saturday, I.I:3O
a.m., Pitt Stadium, student sec-
tion, the Pitt—West Virginia foot-

ball game. It is 40 minutes before I

opening kickoff of the Backyard

Brawl, the stadium is less than
half full, and a few Pitt Greeks are
causing problems.

Some friends and I enter the
stadium and find that almost all
the student seats (especially the
better ones) are reserved by the
pledges of Pitt's various fraterni-
ties and sororities.

- At this point, the non-Greek
has two options: placate the
fraternities and sororities by sit-
ting elsewhere, or sit in the Greek
”designat_ed seats.”

While most choose the former
route, we opted for the latter. We
sat in seats reserved for Zeta Beta
Tau (ZBT). Immediately, we were
approached by a belligerent ig-
noramus (he must have been a
ZBT pledge), who effusively
demanded that we move. He told
us that he would kick someone’s
-55 if we didn't.

This ignominious character ac-
complishes two things by display-

. ing such puerile behavior. First,

his disconcerting behavior is the

' nounce

essence of the Greeks’ image
problem. Drunk or not, his first
instinct was to fight. The sad thing
is that the poor soul probably got
ragged on by the ZBT brothers
because his seat reserving wasn't
successful.

Second, he leads me to ask this
question: When did President
Wesley Posvar formally an-
that Greeks reign
supreme on this campus? I must
have missed it.

This seat saving is indicative of
the narcissism that pervades the
Greek mentality. These Greeks
probably never even considered
the impropriety of their actions.

Much of the reason Greeks par-
tition seats is the festive at-
mosphere (i.e. partying)
associated with Pitt football.
Greeks want to drink excessive-
Iy before the game, depart for the
stadium five minutes before kick-
off, sit (excuse me, stand) with a
large contingent of their fellow
fraternity/sorority friends, and still
see the game's first play.

Try arriving earlier than the
Greeks to claim a good seat, and
you'll find the same outcome —
”Get out. Those are our seats.”

I don't have a television set. I
haven't had one for about five
weeks, and I don't particularly
miss one.

When I moved recently, I left
behind a small, sometimes—color
set which I had to batter into sub-
mi-ssion to get it to warm up. It
was all right as far as old sets go,
with aluminum foil attached to
the antennas to improve recep-
tion for the five or so stations it
could receive in the valley that I
lived in. \

Frankly, I don't miss it.

Like many Americans, . I grew‘

up spending several hours a day
in front of the ”idiot box,” as
some would call it. As a child, my
television watching was informa-
tive in that it shared -some
knowledge with viewers; it was
entertaining, providing .a variety
of movies and serial shows; it was

also escapism through cartoons

or just getting caught up in the lit-
tle reality created by broadcasters
and cathode ray tubes.

A group of friends watching a
movie -also seems sociable.
While most of the attention is on
the flick, conversation might be

In a sense, Greeks want to have
their beer and drink it too.

Non—Greeks would like to do
the same. But the difference lies
in the non—Greeks’ number of
friends. While we non-Greeks
tend to be very popular our-
selves, we can't compete with
Greeks. We don't have 40 or 50
friends with whom we want to
stand and watch a football game.

Greeks would do well to
remember that football games are
to be enjoyed by everyone — not
just the Greeks (i.e. —- Pitt foot-
ball isn't a Greek week activity).

If I go to a Pirate game and buy
a general admission seat, I'm al-
lowed to sit in any seat within the
partitioned area for general ad-
mission seats. Of course, as long
as that seat hasn't already been
taken by a human being — not
some masking tape with Greek
letters on it. The same policy
should hold true for the.student
section at Pitt Stadium.

The actions of the Greeks limit
my seat choice more than 50

Even given the talking restriction,

Being in the media, I have to
keep an eye on breaking stories,

some of the knowledge which I

both local and national networks.
Given the short_time an announ-

understand how an important

I don't care for how several

it's the groomed personalities

Unfortunately, the reaction of
Greeks when you confront them
with this is typical: ”F—k you. You
want to fight about it?”

These intimidating rebuttals are
nonsensical. I will not advocate
similar retaliatory tactics.
However, I would like to know
why the Greeks are so angry
when they get drunk. So belliger-
ent. I used to go to games and
drink, and that didn't make me
want to fight anyone. It certainly
doesn't speak well of some of our
future leaders, that they choose to

The fraternity system in this
country has been subjected to
ample criticism the last few years

rap is justified is questionable.

that every Pitt fraternity and

cognizant of this problem and its

The crux of the matter is that
seat-saving exemplifies the con-

Mountaineers too much for Panthers in 31-10 loss

“By Matt Martin A

It had been billed as the single
most important game since 1981,
when Pitt was 10-0 and Penn
State came to town for a season-
ending showdown.

Pitt was again undefeated, al-
beit only 2-0, when the West
Virginia Mountaineers, also un-
beaten at 3-0, made their way up
I-79 for a match—up with the 16th-
ranked Panthers last Saturday af-

, ternoon.

And it was the 11th—ranked
Mountaineers (4-0) who came
away with a resounding 31-10
blowout before a crowd of
55,978 at Pitt Stadium, not unlike

the 48-14 Penn State thrashinglbf _

Pitt in what was supposed to be
a classic.

”We got beaten by a very good
team,” said Panther
coach Mike Gottfried. ”We broke
down sometimes, and they made

4 plays.”

or rather, a play — a 64-yard
touchdown run by Mountaineer
tailback A.B. Brown at 10:23 of
the third quarter, lengthening the
WVU lead to 17-7.

”They just caught us in a blitz,
and when [Brown] got past the
first wave, there was no one

Pitt cornerback—Cornéll Holloway was not the only Panther unable to bring down WVU tailback A.B. Brown on Saturday.

’’It felt great,” said Brown, a Pitt
transfer from the days of Glad-
man, Heyward, Davis, etc. ”We
knew we needed a big play. We
saw the lineup [Pitt] was in and
we decided to try it. It just hap-
pened that we caught themiin a

gamble. It's a great feeling,”
Brown, who rushed for a game-
high 110 yards, added.

More than that, it came at a
time in the game when neither
team could seem to do much
harm to the other. Pitt trailed 10-7

‘ Walker, Dickerson outmanned
against WVU’s Brown, Harris

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

A few notes left over from
Saturday's 31-10 West Virginia
whitewashing of Pitt:

0 For the first time in 15 games,
no Pitt runner was able to gain
100 yards. .

Adam Walker, frustrated all day
by a swarming WVU defense, led
the Panthers with a low total of
39 yards. Walker's longest run of
the day was 7 yards. Pitt's over-
all longest was a 13 yarder by
Ronald Redmon with only 1:46
to play in the game. In fact, for

the first time this season, the Pan- ,

thers had more passing yards
(176) than rushing yards (81).

’’I don't know if they were
picking on me,” Walker said af-
ter the game. ”They didn't give
me any room to run."

0 West Virginia running back
Anthony Brown had a brilliant
homecoming. In 1985, Brown
practiced his trade in the Panthers
backfield, where he ran for 217
yards on 45 carries. He trans-
ferred, along with fellow runner

3» Eugene Napoleon, to the Moun-

taineers after that season, citing
the glut of Pitt tailbacks at the
time.

Saturday, Brown scampered for
110 yards on 17 carries, includ-
ing a 64-yarder that broke the
game open. After the game,
Brown was just a little happy.

PANTHER
NOTEBOOK  

’’I think everybody played
great,” Brown said. ’’I’m just so
happy because this is something
special to me. We wanted to
show everybody that we are one
of the better teams in the coun-
try. I think we did that.”

0 West Virginia quarterback
Major Harris, a Pittsburgh native
and Brashear High School gradu-
ate, didn't show much on the stat
sheet, but he was a big factor in
the game. He was five for 12
through the air for 61 yards and
ran for 55 yards on 10 rushes.

He also kept the Pitt defense off
the ball. Trying to defend against
the option instead of going for the
man with the ball, Harris would

burn them. When the defense did '

go after Harris, he shoveled the
ball to a running back. Harris
showed why he is considered
one of the best QBs in the
country.

0 The West Virginia band
looked like they had more mem-
bers than the Pitt football team.
Maybe the Pitt band should take
a cue from them.

0 To show you how little time-
of-possession means, Pitt had the
ball for 32:57, and WVU held it
for 27:03.

0 In a throwback to last season,
the Panther defense kept Pitt in
the game. They stopped numer-
ous West Virginia drives, even
though three key players (end
Burt Grossman,»tackle Marc Spin-
dler and linebacker Ricardo
McDonald) were down with in-
juries.

The defense was led by
Richard Allen with nine tackles.
Defensive end Carnel Smith
played inspired ball, getting five
unassisted tackles and a key sack
in the second quarter.

0 One Pitt player who stood
out was linebacker Prentiss
Wright. He was the first player
down on most kickoffs and
seemed to be around the ball all
day.

0 The West Virginia defense
was also very impressive. They
were in the Pitt backfield all day,
and their quick linebackers
wouldn't let Pitt runners get
around the end on any play.

The Mountaineers were led by
virtually unknown‘ linebacker
Theron Ellis with 10 tackles, five
unassisted. Cornerback Alvoid
Mays didn't make any tackles,
but he did pick off two passes,
and the first led directly to a
WVU field goal in the first

g Whenlohn Rasp announced
he would not be returning as
a Pitt punter in 1988, there
was obviously genuine con-
cern on the part of head coach
Mike Gottfried.

That concern has now offi-
cally turned into panic for
Gottfried, as the Panther kick-
ing game has made it apparent
after three games that it is en-
tirely in” need of a tune-up.

The situation reached new
proportions this past weekend,
when a revamped Pitt kicking
lineup did not produce signifi-
cant improvement. In order to
make up for a punting game
that averaged 27.3 yards in the

Home, the Panther place-
kicker for the past two years,
traded his kickoff duties for _a
starting punting job.

Freshman Scott Kaplan
came off the bench to handle
the kickoffs.

The results: a missed
32-yard field goal, a 35.3 yard
punting average, kickoffs that
did not reach the WVU
15-yard line on occassions,
and two West Virginia touch-

first two games, Jeff Van--

downs that might never have ‘
materialized if not for poor
punts in a 31-10 Mountaineer
victory. , -
”Our kicking "game was
atrocious,” Gottfried said.
”We kept putting ourselves in
the hole. [\NVU] played with
good field position all day.”
tVanHorne definitely im-
proved on the punting of the
past two games, getting off
kicks of 43 and 44 yards, but
all of his punts were line drives
that took bounces for large
yardage. Worse yet, that line-
drive characteristic was almost
certainly responsible for the
first crucial play of the game.
With Pitt sitting on the 50 af-
ter failng to convert a third-
and-five in the middle of the
first quarter, VanHorne had a
golden opportunity to bury
West Virginia deep in their
own territory on fourth down.
But a WVU player managed to .
sneak through and partially
block the punt, which then
went out at the WVU 32. Six
plays later, the Mountaineers
scored their first touchdown.
According to Gottfried, the
block should never have hap-
pened. ”They were dropping

to keep my head high and con-
tinue to stick with it.”

Kaplan came on to nail a
34-yard field goal and an extra
point. He also improved his kick-
offs, which in the first half gave
West Virginia its worst field po-
sition on their own 29-yard line.
Following the field goal, his kicki}.
off sailed into the end zone for a
touchback.

”When I went to kick the ball,
I hit it off my toe [in the first
half]/’ Kaplan said. ’’I went to the
sideline and the coaches correct-
ed me.”

Kaplan had no idea that he
would be sent out to attempt the
three-pointer in the second half.
”l was very nervous. But for the
past week I've been really loose,
so I just went out to the field and
gave it my best shot.”

The first-year player from Coral
Springs, Fla., could have been the
biggest benefactor of all of these
problems. Even though there
were no plans to redshirt him if

Rasp had stayed on, it is veryti;

doubtful that he would have seen
any action this season.

But last week, the Pitt coaches
became so desperate for kicking
help that they asked a student
who had a good punting reputa-
tion in intramurals last year to
show up for practice. When that
did not work out, Gottfried and
special teams coach‘ Scott
O’Brien decided to grit their teeth

and told Kaplan that he would get g

to play.

And so the bottom line is that
the kicking jobs are once again
up for grabs, and that facet of the
Panther team is in more disarray
than ever.

Gottfried has used three pun-
ters this season —— Yusef Washing-
ton, Jeff Christy and VanHorne -
with varied amounts of success.

After three games, he has conced— 9.

ed the fact that one of these three
will continue to be the starting
punter.

”We’re going to play with what
we have,” Gottfried said. ”You’re
dealt a certain hand, and that's
what you have to play with.”

great run and gave us some

‘momentum when we needed a
boost."

Pitt could not muster any
momentum throughout the
game. After rushing for 327 yards
in the first two contests, tailback
Adam Walker pounded out only
39 yards, his longest run only 7
yards.

Q/’| don't know if they were
picking on me, but they didn't
give me any room to run today,”
said Walker, who reaggravated a
groin injury in the game.

While the WVU defense was
holding Pitt to 257 total yards, the
Offense was taking advantage of
the loss of three Panther defen-
sive stalwarts — defensive end
Burt Grossman, tackle Marc Spin-
dler and freshman linebacker
Ricardo McDonald — to injuries
in the way Of 322 total yards, 261
on the ground.

”It hurts when you've got guys
out, but they just beat us,” Gott-
fried said. ’’I wouldn't stand up
here and say injuries or anything
else [was]. They just beat us.”

West Virginia opened the scor-
ing on a 33-yard pass from Har-
ris to wide receiver Reggie
Rembert with 5:20 remaining in
the first quarter.

Harris finished with 61 yards
passing on five completions and
added 55 yards on the ground.

With 2:49 left in the first quart-
er, WVU made the score 10-0 on
a 31-yard field-goal by Charlie
Baumann.

Pitt battled back in the second
quarter, with «Dickerson, who
passed for 150 yards, tossing the
touchdown pass to Tuten.

Following Brown's 64-yard run I
in the third quarter, Pitt place-
kicker Scott Kaplan, making his
first collegiate start after Jeff Van

only called for two penalties,
while WVU was flagged for nine.
0 The Panthers have to deal
with not only a ”one” in the loss

; column, but a number of key

players who went down during
the game.

Quarterback Darnell Dickerson
left the game in the fourth quart-
er after being poked in the eye.
Dickerson reported-to the hospi-
tal, the extent of the injury
unknown. Spindler had to leave
with a hip injury. Walker aggra-
vated a groin injury and was less
than 100 percent. Grossman

sprained his ankle last week
against Ohio State. McDonald
left with a sprained ankle. All five
are key players in the Panther
scheme of things.

0 The Panther punting game is
still a big problem. This week, Jeff
VanHorne tried his foot. Van-
Horne kicked five times for a
34.6 yard average, his longest be-

_ing 44 yards. Yusef Wasington

kicked once for 30 yards.

Just how big a problem this is
showed up in the fourth quarter,
when Pitt was trapped at its own
10-yard line. VanHorne kicked a

31-yarder, and WVU’s Grantis

Bell returned it 7 yards. Three

plays later, the Mountaineersi

were in the end zone and the
game was put further out of
reach.

0 The Panthers tried the old
wide—receiver pass play during
the third quarter. Dickerson
handed the ball off to flanker Bil-
fly Osborn, on what looked like
a straight reverse, but Osborn
stopped and threw the ball to fel-
low receiver Henry Tuten. The
play almost worked, but Tuten
was interfered with on the play as
the ball fell incomplete. Pitt end-
ed up settling for a field goal.
