News Editor

A Common Pleas Court lawsuit
was filed Monday against Pitt
President Wesley Posvar, Honors
College Dean G. Alec Stewart
and other Pitt administrators, by
the former assistant dean of Pitt's
Honor College, Arlene Seal, who
claims she was fi red after attempt-
ing to expose illegal drug traffick-
ing at Pitt.

Seal charges that her dismissal
on Aug. 31 ”was part and parcel
of a concentrated effort to con-
ceal a serious drug problem in-
volving the sale and use of illegal
drugs within the university.”

to 12.[p.m.],” said Naro. Plans for
the night club, to be housed in
the concourse area, will be final-
ized next week.

In other business, President
Phil Moyer reported that on ‘Dec.
7, he will be meeting-with Vice
Provost Jack Daniels to discuss
curriculum reforms in under-
graduate education.

The board also approved new
members selected for its Alloca-
tions Committee. ”We are confi-
dent in our decision  ” said
Karen Bohichek, chairperson of
the committee. Those who have
been selected for the committee
will be informed sometime today.

The board rejected a recom-
mendation by Bohichek to deny
a request from the Elections Com-
mittee for a $100 honorarium for
a piano player for the SGB
presidential inauguration on
Jan. 8.

’’It’s a tradition we've had ev-
ery year,” said Jeff Carpenter,
chairperson of the Elections Com-
mittee. ‘

”lt’s a nominal fee  I think it
would just be beneficial all
around,” said Naro. The request
will go back to the Allocations
Committee for approval.

comment on the lawsuit except
that it was a ”situation with a dis-
gruntled employee.” Posvar was
unavailable for comment.

Seal said that she first disco-
vered a drug problem at Pitt
when students approached her
with drug-related complaints. '

”Numerous students came to
me for help, trying to clear this
up,” she said. ”Students seem to
know what's going on [at Pitt]
better than anyone else.”

Seal said that the pushing of
illegal drugs, specifically mariju-

ana and cocaine, by drug rings.
‘and individual suppliers, has ex-

isted as a problem throughout
Seal’s three-year employment at
Pitt.

largely because of the fact that l

reported it, the administration
was apathetic with an investi-
gation.

Seal also said that the Pitt poli-
cy of firing any Pitt employee in-
volved with the -supply or
trafficking of illegal drugs has
been ignored by the adminis-

’’I believe that they don't want

Pitt dorms compete in Lothrop Challenge

By Jason Hillman.
Staff ‘Writer '

Midnight tonight marks the end
of the 1987 Lothrop Challenge.
For over a month, nine residence
halls have been competing to see
who can raise the mostgmoney.

”When we say it's a chal-
lenge,” said Gerald Kowalski, the
assisant director of residence life,
”we mean that there really isn't
any recognition other than know-
ing that you've done some work
for people less fortunate than
youself.”

There is competition, however.

‘'1 hope we win,” said Kim Jones, -
resident life director for Lothrop.

Hall, which hasn't won since

1984. ’’Although the main point
is that all the halls worked hard
to raise money for a good cause.”

Each hall picks a charity to
receive the benefits of their fund-

raising effort. Brackenridge, last”

year's winner, chose the Ameri-
can Cancer Society. Other chari-
ties include the Family House
(Lothrop and Forbes), Hand-in-
Hand (McCormick), Pittsburgh

‘ Speech and Deaf Services (Hol-

land), Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center (Tower C), Chil-
dren’s Hospital (Tower B) and
Make a Wish (Tower A and
Bruce). H a
The winner is not the hall with
the most money but the hall with
the most money perlresident, so

as not to discriminate against the
smaller halls.

The Challenge has been fairly
successful in the past. ”The past
six years, the halls have raised
somewhere between $1,500 and
$2,000 a year,” said Kowalski.
This year, however, the halls plan
to raise $1 per resident, which
amounts to around $4,200 —
over twice as much as in previ-
ous years. _ l

The Lothrop Challenge has be-
come somewhat of a tradition. ”lt
sta_rted in the late '70s. The
Lothrop Hall council challenged

-all of the other resident halls to
see who could raise the most.
m"oney,” said Kowalski. ”|t al-"
_ways happens around Thanks-_i’.
.. .. ,~   . .  .;_..: 

 

giving-Christmas time, when  S

ple are in the spirit of giving.”
In order to raise money, the

halls have come up with various

activities. ”There have been

hoagie sales, candy sales, bake ‘

sales, flower sales  along with
a dating game, movie night and
face painting at the football
games.-” said Jones. .

”One activity that students
have [held] is a human auction,

where people auction off services j

for donations,” said Kowalski.
. There is going to be a special

according to Kowalski, and the

Supreme Court deals blow to prayer advocates

WASHINGTON — The Su-
preme Court on Tuesday refused
to let New Jersey provide mo-
ments of silence for public school
students but gave no hint whether
similar laws in other states imper-
missibly promote school prayer.

The court ruled unanimously
that the New Jersey legislators
who sought to press the con-
troversy in court no longer have
the proper legal standing.

The ruling therefore said noth-
ing about the constitutionality of
a 1982 New Jersey law that said
students may use the daily silent
moments ”for quiet and private
contemplation or introspection.”
About half the states have simi-
lar laws.

A federal appeals court struck
down the New Jersey law, ruling
that it violated the constitutional-
ly required separation of church
and state.

The issue has been, and most
likely will continue to be, politi-
cally charged. And it is likely that

Ha case testing the validity of

another state's moment-of-silence
law will reach the high court.
”The constitutional issue is still

Letter-bomb nabbed

by embassy officials

BEIRUT, Lebanon — A letter-
bomb addressed to British Am-
bassador John Gray was inter-
cepted by his aides Tuesday and
defused by police, embassy offi-

An official at the British Em-
bassy, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Gray and his
wife left Lebanon on vacation
three days ago.

The official confirmed the
letter-bomb was delivered at the
gate of the ambassador’s resi-
dence in east Beirut’s Naccash
district Tuesday afternoon.

He said the letter was ”treated
with normal caution and was
checked.” Police were called be-
cause embassy officials suspect-
ed the letter contained
explosives, he said.

PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh
residents will pay between $5

Officials said the fees would
raise about $250,000 a year.

Council brushed aside a sug-

Flaherty that city officials give up
theirfree parking privileges as a
substitute for the fees.

The homelessneed
a better program

Now we have a new celebrity
among the homeless. Her name
is Joyce Brown. And with her
fame comes a set of questions
about our cities’ obligations to
the mentally ill. A

Joyce Brown, alias Billie Boggs
or Ann Smith, had a chic address
in Manhattan's high-rent district.
She lived on a grate beside a

ELLEN
GOODMAN

 
restaurant at 65th Street and Sec-
ond Avenue. .

On'Oct. 28, Brown became the
first person picked up under a
New York City program. The
mayor had created a plan to
round up some ofthe homeless
mentally ill and take them to
hospital shelters. ,

But in a real way, this story be-
gan much earlier — before Joyce
Brown's life began to fall apart.
Back in the '50s and '60s, it was
easy, too easy, to commit people
to institutions. Then, in the '70s,
as Dr. Darold Treffert, the Wis-
consin psychiarist who has writ-
ten widely on this subject, said
simply, ”The pendulum swung
too far.”

In 1972, a Wisconsin federal

court ruled that the state could
only detain people if they were

' dangerous, and dangerous meant

suicidal or homicidal. It became
harder to hold people against
their will and thus remained
harder to help people.

There were a large number of
people who were not suicidal,
not homicidal, but gravely disa-
bled — people who just didn't
know enough to come in out of
a snowstorm. .Dr. Treffert collect-
ed some of their stories under the
title: People Who Died With
Their Rights On.

Now, in urban America, many
wonder whether the respect for
rights isn't also an excuse for
neglect. The feisty mayor of New
York, Ed Koch, is one of the few
who decided to push the pendu-
lum back. '

It is too bad for the mayor and
for the program thatJoyce Brown
was its first target. He would have
had a better case with the man
who willingly shares his plastic
bag ”house” with rats in Central
Park or the woman’ acting out her
own sexual hallucinations in the
Port Authority terminals.

Joyce Brown, however, resist-
ed the city’s ”help” all the way
to court. There, one group ofpsy-
chiarists portrayed her as a psy-

chotic who defecated in the
streets and ran in front of traffic.
Another portrayed her as a ration-
al survivor who could take care
of herself. ’ ,
The 40-year-old former secre-
tary, shored up by all the atten-
tion (or in a respite from her
mental disorder), was her own
best witness. The ”professional”
street dweller, as she called her-
self, was hard to distinguish from
the other homeless we are con-
ditioned to ignore. So, the judge
ruled that she be allowed to
return to her homeless home.
Make no mistake, there are no
victors in this case. The civil

_liberties lawyers who protected

Brown's rights to be ”free” know
that the streets provide a mean
sort of freedom. The judge who
ordered’ Brown's release also
wrote pointedly, ”There must be
some civilized alternatives other
than involuntary hospitalization
or the street.”

Joyce Brown herself, ”choos—
ing” street life, was asked in court
where she would like to go. She
wanted to go to an apartment.
Could she afford it? No, she an-
swered.

In reality, there are very few
civilized alternatives. Today,
there are fewer institutions and
more mentally ill people on the
streets. If released (she is being

held on appeal), Brown might go
on coping. Or, like so many
others, she might have to deteri-
orate to the point of real danger
to get help.

The homeless celebrity provid-
ed a poor test case for the city.
But even the judge called the pro-
gram a firststep in the right direc-
tion. It won't cure high rents and

homelessness. It won't end psy-v

chosis. It won't produce a com-
munity mental health program.
But New York is offering a small
antidote to urban callousness. At

the very least, we can provide‘

emergency help to some of the
mentally ill before they, too, die
.with their rights on. ‘

Last night, WPTS and the Pitt

two objectives: to create a com-
fortable atmosphere for foreign
students and to allow students
from various areas of the world
to become acquainted and to get
involved.

”One of- the advantages of
PISO is that anyone can join,”
she said.

According to Gibson, UNICEF
was chosen for their fund-raising
effort because ”[Pitt] has a lot of
students from underdeveloped

rural countries,” said Gibson.

Gibson said that PISO has held
fundraising dances in the past
and that the UNICEF dance was
the first dance sponsored by
PISO. She also said that represen-
tatives from UNICEF encouraged
PISO to hold the dance.

John Anderson, a member of
PISO, said that they will consider
making the dance an annual
event

Prizes were available for any at-
tending student to win. Gift cer-
tificates and prizes were donated
from Goodies, King's Court Cine-
ma and Your Campus Store.
Cameron Coca Cola donated 20
cases of beverages for the event.

People attending the event do-

nated $3 upon admission. .

However, according to Bree Free-
man, station manager of WPTS,
attendance was markedly low.

”We mean no malice to any-
one. We had to sacrifice some-
one for the story line, so it was
Pittsburgh,” said Mark Gruen-
wald, co-author of the comic
book. ”We’re hoping that if we
ever come to the city, we won't
be lynched.”

The fictional Connell is the
brainchild of free-lance co-author
Jim Shooter, a Pittsburgh native
who wanted to play up his
hometown in his comics, accord-

ing to Gruenwald.

Gruenwald said Connell
received super powers 13 issues
ago and has been struggling with
them ever since. He said the ci-
ty's atoms will swirl around for
several months, spawning volca-
noes, disrupting weather patterns
and creating other terror.

Gruenwald said the comic ser-
ies has been using Pittsburgh's
skyline and geographic refer-
ences all along.

’’But I guess we'll be throwing
out most of our Pittsburgh refer-
ence library now that the city is
gone,” Gruenwald said.

THE _P|TT NEWS

By Innes Mitchell

For The Pitt News

Strep throat, influenza and the

common cold, all ailments as-A

socitated with the last few weeks
of the semester, and imminent fi-
nal exams are the ‘bane of any
self-respecting Pitt student.

For Ian Anderson, lead singer
and driving force behind rock
band Jethro Tull, these afflicitions
meant an exhausting perfor-
mance in Philadelphia the day
before Thanksgiving.

On stage before a packed

O house of enthusiastic Philadel-

phians, with the concert being
recorded for a local radio station,
Ian Anderson spent a gruelling

two hours entertaining. the Tull
faithful.

Ian Anderson, Dave Pegg and artin Brre haveeen aking music together since the '60s.

With sweat flying and.a towel
wrapped around his shoulders for
at least half of the show, Ander-
son pranced around the stage
flaunting his manic good looks
and singing with verve, his voice
sounding a little strained at times.

I ventured to the city of brother-
ly love to see the band after ar-
ranging an interview with Ian
Anderson, unfortunately post-
poned due to his throat problems.

I had already interviewed him
three years ago in Scotland, on
the first date of their previous tour
promoting Under Wraps, the
American leg of which witnessed
his first bout of throat trauma.

”When I started the tour in '84,

I was fine. It was OK until just af-

ter we got to America; then it.
started to get really tight and sore
before the end of the show, and

the only way to get the notes out
was to sing evenlouder,” he later
stated.

‘ 

When lstarted the tour
in '84, I was fine. It was
OK until just after we
got to America; then it
started to get really
tight  .

—— Ian Anderso

With their latest album, Crest
ofA Knave, being hailed by fans
and critics alike as the best Tull
album for several years, it is ob-
vious that the three-yeargwait, if
proving insufficient to cure his

voice problems, has done noth-
ing to curb Ian Anderson's musi-
cal abilities.

On this auspicious occasion,
he can also give thanks to the
able support afforded him by per-
manent band members Martin
Barre (guitar) and Dave Pegg

(bass), complimented on this tour

by Doane Perry (drums) and new
boy Don Airey (keyboards). Airey
has played with Rainbow,
Whitesnake, Gary Moore and
Ozzy Osbourne, to name a few.

I must admit to being slightly
surprised by the reaction of
friends when I informed them of
my proposed trip and who I was
going to see. The responses
ranged from: ’’I wouldn't go to
Philadelphia to see Jethro Tull,’’

Wednesday, December 2, I987

Jethro

 

Spanning
the ages
of rock

to ’’I wouldn't cross the street to
to see them!”

After taking my seat in the sold-
out concert theater, however, it
was apparent that this ”bunch of
old men” — as another disparag-
Ingly remarked —— are as musical-
ly attractive to high school and
college students as they are to
those who identify with them
from the late '60s.

With concert dates remaining

1 across the country from Chicago

and San Francisco to Portland,
Ian Anderson faces a ‘challenge
(considering his throat problems)‘
to rival even the final two weeks

‘ of a Pitt semester! As much as he

enjoys performing, I'm sure, like
the rest of us, he'll be thankful for
the Christmas vacation.

Planes, Trains and Automobiles doesn’tgo far  

By Ike Shibley

Staff Writer

The advice given by Steve Martin to
holiday travelers at a recent press confer-
ence was: ”Don’t Col!”

The press conference was held in Los
Angeles on Paramount Studio's Stage 17,
which had been turned into an airport ter-
minal for the occasion, to promote his
newest movie called Planes, Trains and
Automobiles.

Also at the conference were Martin's
co-star John Candyand the movie's direc-
torJohn Hughes. All three were in good
spirits as they amiably answered ques-
tions from the press, many of them col-
lege students who had been flown out for

the conference and the viewing of the"

film.

The reason for all the hoopla surround-
ing this picture, it seems to me after view-
ing it, is that Paramount wants to achieve
an abundance of coverage on it. There are
several reasons for this.

Firstly, the film stars two of the biggest
(no pun intended toward John Candy)
comedy stars of the '80s. Steve Martin is
already being touted as a possible Oscar
nominee in both writing an. acting

‘categories for this summer's delightful

film Roxanne.

His performance as C.D. Bales was
wonderful, as was the script that was an
updated version of Edmond Rostand’s
Cyrano de Bergerac. John Candy has
been hilariously funny in some less-than-
great films, most recently Summer Ren-
tal and Armed and Dangerous. Together,
the two comedians should have immense
box—ffice drawing power.

The second reason for the media satu-
ration is that Planes, Trains and Automo-
biles is the first ’’adult’’ film from
writer/director/producer John Hughes.
Until now, Hughes has concentrated his
energies toward more youth-oriented pic-
tures that starred many of the members
of the "brat pack” of Hollywood, espe-
cially Molly Ringwald and Anthony
Michael Hall. ’

His list of film credits as director and
writer is impressive: Sixteen Candles, The
Breakfast Club, Weird Science and Ferris
Bueller’s Day Off. In‘ addition, he has writ-
ten several other hit comedies: Mr. Mom,
National Lampoon's Vacation, Pretty in
Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful. For
this multi-million dollar director to be
working with ”grown—ups” is an event
worth creating a stir about.

A third reason for the publicity push is

that Planes, Trains and Automobiles is

. about holiday travel and was released for

the Thanksgiving holiday.

The major reason that Paramount is put-
ting so much money into publicity of this
film is because it is _not very good.

The story is about Neal Page (Martin),
who is an, urbane executive who has a
disasterous trip from New York to Chica-
go over Thanksgiving.

The main reason he has such a misera-
ble time is that he somehow gets linked
up with Del Griffith (Candy), who is a
shower curtain ring salesman and is both
garrulous and obnoxious. Together the
two travel by airplane, train, bus, automo-
bile, taxi and truck to get home.

The comedy is not the problem in this
movie. The reason that it leaves the view-
er with no lingering memory after the fi-
nal credits have rolled by is that Hughes
felt it necessary to include some sappy,
hackneyed emotional scenes that serve
only to make the viewer uncomfortable,
thus ruining the comedy that had gone
before and is to follow.

The serious moments of the film come
after brilliant comic moments, and the

' former defuse the effectiveness of the lat-
ter. It is at shamebecause there was

definite potential for this movie to be a

 

   

real side-splitter.
I have no objection to the sentimental-
ism of the film; it is only that I wish it

' would have been inserted more adroitly.

The desired response is not ellicited from
these moments because they are haphaz-

ardly dropped into the script without any

consideration for the feel of the film.
Hughes seems to feel obligated to reach
out and ouch the viewer instead of sim-
ply amglsing him. He was not bold
enough to produce a comedy that would
propel the characters simply because of
the situations they found themselves in.
The Marx Brothers rarely had any sen-

timentality in their films that was not-

ridiculed by someone in the cast. Yet, the
characters were warm and touching sim-
ply because they did not succumb to the
smarminess that some script writers
would have created. I thank. goodness
Hughes was not employed by them.

‘Do not misunderstand me. I am not say-
ing that all comedies should pattern them-
selves after the Marx Brothers, I am only
using their films as, an example of come-
dies that were warm but not slushy in
their sentimentalism. -

If Hughes would have retained all the

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, December 2, 1987

CBS creates format to brighten morning ratings

By David Ballarotto
Staff Writer

The old chestnut says: If at first
you don’t‘succeed, try, try, UV
again.

But if you're CBS and you're
trying to attract a sizeable au-
dience from 7 to 9 a.m., then you
may as well forget it. .

Never has CBS been able to
make a fatal punch to either
NBC's or ABC's morning fare;

\ now it hopes to do so with CBS

This Morning.

The new show, hosted by for-
mer Good Morning, America
substitute Kathleen Sullivan and
CBS correspondent Harry Smith,
lives up to the other old chestnut:

 

Imitation is the highest form of
flattery. '

This new program is just like
the Today Show and Good Morn-
ing, America. The only difference
is that despite Charles Osgood’s
”Osgood File,” Economics Cor-
respondent Robert Krulwich
(who could be the Gallagher of
news) and the humorous
weatherman Mark McEwen, this
program doesn't seem to have the
knack the other networks’ shows
do.

Indeed, those who were upset
with the Morning Program, the
CBS entertainment program that
This Morning is replacing, will be
pleased to see the network has
given back the breakfast slot to its

news division. Once more, morn-
ing audiences will wake up to
late-breaking information.

But the problem is that the new
show is so much like its opposi-
tion. The viewer has no real
choice except wondering if he'll
see Jane Pauley, Joan Lunden or
Sullivan.

Whereas with the Morning Pro-
gram, where the viewer could
choose between news or humor,
there was a distinct flavor to the
CBS option. But that show’s rat-
ings and reviews were too un-
favorable for the network to keep
with it.

Weatherman Mark McEwen, a
hold-over from the old show,
brings with him his little ”Marki—

mos,” the magnetic caricatures of
himself he places on the weather
map. Medical Correspondent Dr.
Bob Arnot is the only other trans-
plant to the new series.

Surely, any other resemblance
to an original program is purely
coincidental. Maybe with some
time, the program will develop
some sort of identity to set itself
apart from the other network
morning news shows.

But knowing CBS’ patience
with such programming, that's
doubtful. From the CBS Morning
News (hosted by Hughes Rudd)
and Charles Kuralt’s Morning to

the CBS Morning News (hosted
by — now get ready —— Bill Kur-
tis and Diane Sawyer; Kurtis and
Phyllis George; Forrest Sawyer
and Maria Shriver; Charles Rose
and Faith Daniels; Rose and San-
dy Hill) and the Morning Pro-
gram hosted by Mariette Hartley
and Rolland Smith, the network
is expecting an instant hit.

Maybe that's why the set mo- .

nitors have the word ”this” itali-
cized; it's CBS This Morning, but
it's hard to tell what it will be
tomorrow morning.

Planes-

Del for several minutes — the
characters would still have been
endeanng.

In the example I mentioned,
the scene could have ended with
Del getting in an uproar over the
insults before covering his face
with the covers. Then Neal could
have felt guilty and remained for
the night. The same effect would
have been achieved and the hu—
mor would not have been left
behind.

The reason I digress so much is
that I truly feel that Planes, Trains
and Automobiles could have
been a riotously funny film. If one

can ignore the scenes that do not A

fit in, the film can still be viewed
pleasurably.

A hugely inappropriate scene
occurs when Neal becomes en-
raged because his rental car is not
there. He emits a string of ”F”

words that pain the viewer to
hear. Because of this scene the
film received an ”R” rating from
the Motion Picture Association of
America. Without that one scene,
or with a change in dialogue, the
movie would probably have got-
ten a ”PG” tag.

At the press conference, Mar-
tin claimed that the language was
necessary to convey Neal's emo-
tions. An intelligent man like
Neal may fly off the handle when
all goes amiss, but he.wouldn’t

forget all his dignity and intellect. ’

A single use of the ”F” word
mixed in with someother super-
latives would have been equally
effective in expressing Neal's an-
. O . .
guish. It IS sad that such a gratui-
tous display of vulgarity had to be
used. That one scene alone near-
ly ruins the movie.

The music is yet another an-
noying aspect of the film. In all

of Hughes’ movies, he-likes to '

employ a pop soundtrack. In this
movie, there is no. need for it. A
subdued score would have ac-

cented the movie enough, but V

that would not have satisfied
Hughes. He had to include songs
that are sure to make Billboard's
Hot 100.

There is a trend in Hollywood

to mold a movie around a sound- A %

track. Many movies seem to be

S made with the soundtrack as the

driving force behind it. Top Gun
is the prime example of this MTV
mentality. A film loses its visual
power when the audio is utilized
so blatantly (and usually banally).

Planes, Trains and ‘Automo-
biles may tickle your funny bone
occasionally and it may even pro-

voke a sustained laugh. When it ‘

is finished, though, the feeling is
that sitting in an airport terminal
is almost as interesting as the film.

the public and the press that she
is a vivacious, even feisty young
woman with a zest for life.

Worldwide fame hasn't
changed the deaf actress. Ask her
if she is still going with her Chil-
dren of a Lesser Cod co-star and
sweetheart, William Hurt, she
bristles and responds with flash-
ing fingers:

’’I could ask you about your
wife. I'm a person who is very in-
dependent, and I can say that I'm
a person who is very happy at this
point."

as best actress of 1986 for Chil-
dren of a Lesser God. It's a
Universal release, Walker, a Cen-
tral American adventure of the
mid-18005. She plays the wife of
William Walker, a real-life Ameri-
can soldier of fortune who ruled
Nicaragua for two years as presi-
dent. Ed Harris appears as
Walker.

In an interview at her agent's
office, the 22-year-old actress
described her role through the
rapid-fire interpreting of Jack
Jason:

”The woman is Ellen Walker,
who was, I imagine, about 25

years old, perhaps older. She is.

based on a true character, a wom-
an who was deaf but did speak,
though somewhat vaguely. She
was a woman who was very bril-

_ Matllfi l5 <'f1PP€3_"ln8thl5 month liant, and she kept a lotto herself.
in the first film since her victory she was not an open person, but

she was not a vulnerable person,
either. She was just very strong-
willed.

”She is different from Sarah (in
Lesser God). Sarah was a very an-
gry person. She was very private
— private with her thoughts and
about her past. Ellen Martin, on
the other hand, shared her
thoughts with William Walker.
The two women are the same in
that they are hearing-impaired.

”There are different kinds of
hearing—impaired people, you
know. There are just as many
differences as between people
who can hear.”

Matlin was born in Morton

Grove, |ll., the youngest of three '

children. At 18 months, she was
stricken with the high fever of
roseola, also known as baby
measles, which destroyed most of
her hearing.

When she was eight years old,
she played Dorothy in The Wiz-
ard of Oz at Chicago's Centeryon
Deafness. That led to other plays,
but she quit acting in high school
to improve her study habits. Af-
ter graduating, she studied crimi-
nal justice, with the goal of
fighting for the rights of the deaf.

That goal was interrupted after
she played the role of Lydia in
Children of a Lesser God in
Chicago. An agent spotted her,
and she was invited to audition
for the film version. To‘,her sur-
prise, she was tested for the role
of Sarah, not Lydia. A test with
William Hurt and director Randa
Haines won her the leading role.

Mini Reviews

If you've nothing better to do
Saturday evenings, tune in We
Got it Made.

But here's a warning: Some-

times this program can be very-

entertaining. Sometimes it can be
dull and insulting to your intel-
ligence. '

This program, starring Teri
Copley, Tom Villard and John
Hillner, airs locally on WPGH-TV
53 Saturday evening. (It also had
a brief stint on NBC in its pre-
Cosby days.)

In the show, Copley plays a
dumb blonde named Mickey

McKenzie who is employed as a ’

maid by Jay Bostwick (Villard), a
strange, young» importer who is
also a bit dizzy, and David Tuck-
er (Hillner), a young attorney. The
threesome get into typical sitcom
situations, but the writing sets this
show apart and helps take away
its image as a Three's Company
copy. '

Few lines on this show are just
for gags. The majority of the dia-
logue has some bearing on the

\situation. Everything from a snide
remark to a pun dovetails.

That's for the good episodes.
Some just plain stink. For exam-
ple, Mickey is given a morning
television show (no, not on CBS)
where she bombs. David and Jay

decide to help her out. Ho hum.
Unrealistic and stupid.

Grade: Depends on episode. I

B+orD-
EIIIZIIEJ

On Sunday nights, if you're
looking for some down-home en-
tertainment, try ABC's Dolly, star-
ring the one and only Dolly
Parton.

This, the first network variety
program in years, tries to give this
genre of programming a new
look, and it succeeds.

Parton’s show has a glossy look
and avoids the dance numbers
and such that had been part of TV
variety shows since the days of Ed
Sullivan. ‘

Segments on the show include
”Dixie’s Diner,” a sentimental
piece usually dealing with some-

one’s dreams in life; ”_Vanity 5

Fair,” where women guests brag
about themselves; "Tennessee
Mountain Home,” where Dolly
remembers her childhood and
adolescence while growing up in
the country.

The show is fast-moving and
entertaining whether or not the
viewer likes country music.

If you haven't seen it yet, tune
in. It's original, fun and vastly en-
