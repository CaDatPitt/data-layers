Pitt gains bowl eligibility
behind ,Donald’s big game

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The Syracuse Orange started off the
game with a 36-yard touchdown run by
Jerome Smith. But the game’s margin
was decided on the next snap when Aar-
on Donald pushed through Syracuse’s
line and got his ﬁngertips on Ryan N or-
ton’s extra—point attempt.

“I got a good get-off, got under his
pads, pushed him back and got my
hands in the air,” Donald said. “I got
a piece of it.”

Ultimately, Pitt beat the Orange, 17-
16. The Panthers (6-5, 3-4 ACC) reached
bowl eligibility for the ﬁfth consecutive
season, and the second time in head
coach Paul Chryst’s second season at
Pitt.

Donald’s play and overall effort was
decisive for the Panthers to clinch a trip

“A lot of times you think that kick’s
going to be lower,” Chryst said. “But I’m
going to look at it from our end. It was a
tremendous effort. We got some push.”

Aside from his block early on, Don-
ald racked up nine total tackles with 3
1/2 tackles for loss and a pair of quar-
terback hurries.

“I’m just trying to do my job,” Donald
said. “I play and try to do what I can
do. When plays present themselves, I
try to make them.”

tudents can he|pcity’s ubiqitous feline strays

Joelle Smith
Staff Wrz'ter

Roc the Panther is not the only cat prowl-
ing Pittsburgh. Populations of stray cats
roam the city’s alleys and steel bridges,
leaving students to decide whether or

not to interfere in their nine lives.

Gerald Akrie, the supervisor of
Pittsburgh Animal Control, estimated
that Pittsburgh’s population of strays
decreased by about nine percent from
1,039 cats in 2011 to 1,026 cats in 2012.
Akrie said he projects this year’s count
— which is 834 cats as of November —
to further decrease because of various
spay and neuter programs.

Akrie predicted that the number of
strays will remain somewhat constant,
but added that “a cat population will
only grow but so big in an area.”. This

is due in part to surgical steriliza-tions . l

within the stray population. The territo-

rial nature of cats also predisposes them‘

not t0 venture fat‘ from l'lOI'I'l€.

He added that calculatingan exact
number of strays in Pittsburgh, or in a
specific neighborhood of-the city, would
provenearly impossible. —, 2 as _‘

with and without homes across the city.
The Animal'Lovers Club at Pitt runs a
Variety of fundraisers across the school
year to keep strays as comfortable as
possible in local shelters. The club is
afﬁliated with two Pittsburgh shelters:
the Animal Rescue League of Western
Pennsylvania and Animal Friends.
Emily Smith , president of the Ani-
mal Lovers club, said the club’s focus is

encouraging students to volunteer at

The program’s goal is to alleviate the

Smith said the Animal Lovers Club
was created to “help animals. in the
Pittsburgh area” and “give students a
chance to interact with animals  when
they are away from home, since a lot of
[students] leave pets behind and they
miss them.”

She also said that students who
volunteer help the animals as well as

themselves. ,

Arianna Garcia, a junior psychology
major, said that while some people pre-
fer to avoid neighborhood strays, she
opted to adopt one.

In August, Garcia and her roommate,
Michelle Francis, also a junior psycholo-
gy major, moved into their second-story
apartment onjuliet Street in South Oak-
land. Once they settled in, they could not
ignore their feline housewarming guest.

“The weekend after we moved in,

’ we heard the little tingling of her bell

on our deck, so we opened up the back
door, and she was there,” Garcia said.
“She was really, really friendly.” '
Garcia, Francis and their neighbors
agreed to start feeding the cat, which
they soon named Margo. ‘

ence and business major who lives in

_ the house next to Garcia, said he and his
_ roommates later began to suspect that

brace of Marcellus Shale, the geological
formation under much of the state that
is rich with natural gas.

Pitman said shale development has
generated more than $1.8 billion in
state tax revenue, as well as more than
$400 million in payouts to local govern-
ments as a result of legislation signed
by Corbett in 2012 to offset costs to the
local infrastructure or environment
from natural gas drilling.

According to Pitman, 141,000 pri-
vate sector jobs were created in Penn-
sylvania during Corbett’s tenure, a
number that comes from a Pennsylva-
nia Department of Labor and Industry
report released last August.

But Beth Melena, a spokeswoman for

the Pennsylvania Democratic Party,*had

her own number.

Melena said that there have only

‘ been 75,000 new private-sector, non-
farm jobs since Corbett took office. She‘

saidshe came to this number by tallying

up monthly job report data from the

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from
January 2011, when Corbett was inau-
gurated,.until July 2013.

Melena said it is important to com-
pars job growth ﬁgures in Pennsylva-
nia with those of other large states to
provide context. : '_ V V

“Among the 10 largest states, of

which we’re sixth,” Melena said ina

pre ared statement,1“we‘-gained the

_fewést jobs [in 2012].”

She said that although Ohio, Geor-
gia, Michigan and North Carolina are’

all less populous than Pennsylvania,
twice as many new jobs were created
in all four of those states than in Penn-
sylvania.

Central to Melena’s argument is the
assertion that when Corbett ﬁrst took
ofﬁce, Pennsylvania was ranked 11th
in private-sector job growth. It is now
ranked 45th. These numbers come from
a labor statistics website run by the
W.P. Carey School of Business at Ari-
zona State University in Phoenix. The
website compiles data from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, providing
rankings of U.S. states based on their
rates of job growth, the numbers of jobs.
created and other factors.

But according to James Kenkel, an
economics professor at Pitt, none of
this means much of anything.

“When talking about j ob growth, you

should realize that, unlike the federal
government, the state government is
required to have a balanced budget,”
Kenkel said in an email. “Thus, there
really is not a lot that a state govern.-
ment can do to boost job growth.”
Kenkel mentioned that cutting
corporate tax rates is one of the few
things a state can do to attract busi-
ness, but Pennsylvania hasn’t done that.
He added that Pennsylvania, as well as
other states such as North Dakota and
South Dakota, might show temporary
job growth because of the recent uncon-
ventional gas drilling boom. But this
growth is unrelated to the state govern-
ment’s attempts to attract business.
— As for job growth rankings, Kenkel

in 2010?? McPhete‘rs_‘said. “Bu_tth'e'_'av—

v McPheters also pointed out the dif-
ference between rate of growth and
number of growth, and he said that
Pennsylvania ranked 18th in number
ofjobs created in 2012.

“Has job growth stalled?” McPhet-
ers asked. “No, it has increased  but
slower than in‘ the’ average state.”

._ McPheters also made a distinction
between the number ofjobs created
overall and the type ofjobs created.
He said in August 2012, Pennsylvania
ranked 10th in number of new jobs in
professional, technical and science
categories, with 8,600 jobs. The rate
of growth in these categories was 2.7
percent, which was slightly less than
the national average of 2.76 percent.

“These are very desirable jobs to
be adding,” McPheters said, and he
pointed out that Pennsylvania was in

CORBETT  

said those numbers “are just due to ran-
dom luck.” Kenkel pointed out that,
according to the job growth website,
California’s ranking went from six to
27, Newjersey from 27 to nine, ‘Indiana

eight from 2012 to 2013.

Lee McPheters, a director at Arizona
‘State University’s W.P. Carey School of
Business, oversaw the development of
the job growth website cited by Me— _
lena and analyzed by4Kenkel. Accord-
ing to McPheters, Pennsylvania ranked _
ninth in job growth in 2010, growing
0.1 percent. But because most states
lostjobs that year, ranking in the top
10 did not require a signiﬁcant number
of new jobs.

McPheters said that although Penn-
sylvania ranked 44th in job growth in
2012, the state added 42,200 jobs,
which is about 10 times more than in
2010. V

“Cats are very resourceful,” he said.

in the past year alone, Pittsburgh Animal

often in the same area.

Akrie said cats’ territorial nature cre-
ates a resistance to relocating. Most
homeowners take action because of
past property damage, which includes a
range of inconveniences from unearthed
ﬂowerbeds to rodents left on the front

Although cats can help cities deal
with rodent problems, Akrie said they
can also pose a danger for residents.

He also noted that people’s biggest
danger currentlyis not the presence of
the strays themselves, but that people
sometimes choose to help animals that
could be unstable.

While he understands that some
people have f‘big hearts” for cats, Akrie
recommended people take a hands—off
approach when a stray wanders onto

their street. Unless the cats destroy

property, he said people should leave
them alone.

“Many times that heart. takes them
past common sense [and] puts [people]
in a danger,” he said. Feral cats could
carry disease or bite individuals who
try to help them.

choice to look after the neighborhood
cat might not be the best decision for
everyone. But, she added, if residents
want to reduce the number of stray cats

in an area, they should take action.

“You don’t have to cuddle with the

a recession. But the state lost a lot of
retail jobs, coming in at 49th place in
this category.

“So the loss in low—paying retail jobs
has a negative impact on the overall
ranking,” said McPheters.

Although McPheters stopped short of
drawing conclusions about what exactly
this means forjob-seekers -— and vot-
ers — in Pennsylvania, Kenkel saidjob
growth isn’t a very good indicator as to
who voters should choose.

“In my opinion, it is unreasonable to
assume that all of these big jumps  are
due to changes in government policies

SOPHILTHY

'Ihis Week, keep the ‘thanks’ in

Sophia A1 Rasheed '
Columnist

I’m not sure who was in charge of
deciding the placement of holi-
days in the United States, but they
clearly didn’t take into account
how anticlimactic the current
holiday placement would make
the ﬁrst few monthsrof the calen-
dar year. All of the excitement and
“seasona ” displays from Septem-
ber through December culminate
and then promptly disappear
once the New.Year rolls around
—— just in time for the post-season
chubbiness and fewer hours of
sunshine. Holidays are inher-
ently ﬂawed, in addition to their



less—than—desirable placement.
Holidays in the United States are
contradictory: They are days we
have created to remind us of the
value of tradition and the beauty
of family, which we cover with a
thick layer of consumerism.

But in the midst of the rotten
way we choose to deﬁne Ameri-
can culture, Thanksgiving stands

as one holiday worth appreciat- V

ing.

Yes, just like almost every
other holiday, Thanksgiving is
tainted with inconsistencies -
it’s sandwiched between the big-
gest drinking day of the year and
a day on which people turn into
animals for electronics — but if

we remove these layers, we can
actually pull some good from it.
Giving thanks is the main
reason that I like Thanksgiv-
ing, other than the whole"‘I’m
not counting a single calorie to-
day” part, it directs us to a rare
act that is otherwise shielded by
our tendency to constantly look
for upgrades to our happiness.

‘ A societal search for the next
upgrade is the underlying reason
for the negative aspects that sur-
roundthe holiday. The consumer-
ism causes employees to go into
work on a holiday and cater to

- Al Rasheed D 6

<lFROM PAGE 5...

AL RASHEED    

society’s desire for 40 percent off the retail
price and a free tote bag. If eliminated, the
holiday would receive a lot more credit.
But instead of understanding what it
means to be appreciative and give thanks,
that is, to squash our normal, selﬁsh ten-
dency to whine about how things could be
better, we ﬁnd ourselves doing the exact
opposite. The culture surrounding Thank’s-
giving poses a huge contradiction to the

reason for celebrating it in this ﬁrst place.
We’re left in a weird position of under-

taking the basic act of giving thanks in lieu ‘

of the overarching. cultural siwampland
associated with it. To ignore the holiday
would mean to ignoresomething as self-

, less as giving thanks, while partaking in

Thanksgiving comes with these other
inconsistencies. But the more I thought
about it, the more I realized that it would
be a huge contradiction to let the inconsis-
tencies of Thanksgiving take away from the
positive aspects of the holiday because this
is essentially what giving thanks asks us to

do. The" best way to approach this day-is to
look for the good in what it is. It’s a day that
allows us to remember family, tradition
and the simple pleasure of a goodﬁmeal.
The table we visit changes each year,
whether that is because of the people sur-
rounding it, the ages of those people or
the experiences they bring to it. Chanc-
es are that there are a few changes that
could make the day better (for example,
being above the age of twelve and not be-

ing forced to sit at the kids table; dinner ‘

conversations that for once won’t include
how useless a philosophy major is), and on

a large scale, it would be immensely better
if it,didn’t involve societal ﬂaws such as
consumerism or mass killing of turkeys.
But this year, try toavoid _s1ipping,i’nto this
habit of thinking of the negativeaspects.
Enjoy what you have and help us, asia
contradicting, celebratory society, collec-
tively render something good out of this
day. Strip the negativity as much as you can
V and simply appreciate. If you need me, I’ll
probably be at the kid’s table. I

Panthershead to Brooklyn for season’s first true tests

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staﬁ' Wrz'ter

After having their way against Howard

and Lehigh in the regional round of the
Progressive Legends Classic, members
of the Pitt men’s basketball team have
traveled to New York to continue play
in the early season tournament.

The Panthers (490) will take on Texas
Tech (4-1) at 7:30 p.m. in the Barclays
Center, home of the Brooklyn Nets.
Stanford and Houston will play the tour-
nament’s following game at 9:30 p.m.

The winners of each game will play
in the championship game Tuesday at
9:30 p.m. in the Barclays Center, and the
losers will play in a consolation game
at 7 p.m.

Pitt redshirt senior Lamar Patterson
suffered a minor injury tolhis Achilles
early last week during practice, and
head coachjamie Dixon said Patterson
still felt some lingering pain toward the

end of the week. ,

Yet Patterson is expected to play
against Texas Tech, a team entering
tomorrow’s contest with a double—digit
loss to Alabama under its belt.

1 The Red Raiders are led by first-year
head coach Tubby Smith, who has been
in the head-coaching business for 22
years. At age 62, Smith appears to be
in the downhill stretch of his coaching
career. From 1997 to 2007, Smith was
at the helm at Kentucky, where he col-
lected a national title, ﬁve Southeast-
ern Conference championships and an
award for Associated Press Coach of
the Year. S

In 11 seasons at Pitt, Dixon has not
been matched up against a team led

, by Smith.

“This year, they’ve been a physical
team with good size and good strength,
and he has older guys too,” said Dixon.

Dixon also said the Red Raiders pri-

marily show a man-to-man, but mix
in some 2-3 zone on occasion. Smith
will try to control the game’s pace at
all times, playing a slower game of bas-
ketball.

Win or lose, Dixon and his coaching
staff will have "under 24 hours to prepare
for their next opponent. Dixon said he
has a system in place for scouting during
these types of tournaments.

“We always assign a coach to each
team, and we scout them like we’re defi-
nitely playing them, and then we have
to make that decision once the winner
or loser comes about,” Dixon said. “We
look at it as the same thing. We have a
shorter amount of time to prepare for
it, and our team does as well. You focus
on the first one, the one you know you’re
playing, and put all your emphasis on
that.”

Four Pitt players are from the New
York area. Dixon always tries to sched-

ule at least one game per year in the
area so his players have a chance to
“go home.”

Guard Cameron Wright, a redshirt
junior, is always excited to go to the New
York area because he knows one of his
teammates’ families will house the team
and feed them a home—cooked meal.

“We’re familiar with the city, and my 3

entire team is excited to get back up to
New York. We have a lot of guys from
the New York area, so we’re excited to
go home,” said Wright.

Pitt is 42-20 since the turn of the
century in the New York City and New
Jersey area. Wright said he is excited to
play away from home for this reason,
and he is actually one of the few who
prefers playing on the road to playing
at the Petersen Events Center.

WRESTLING

Panthers rally at no. 25 Lehigh for 2116-15 victory

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬁ’ Pf/rz‘ter

Of the 10 matches in the dual meet be-
tween No. 22 Pitt and No. 25 Lehigh,
only one resulted in bonus points, and
that was No. 6, 184—pound Pitt wrestler
Max Thomusseit’s major decision.

With the major decision, Thornus}
seit, a senior, earned four team points,
and the extra point was just enough to
sneak the Panthers past Lehigh, 16-15.

Thomusseit won 13-1 over Lehigh’s
Zach Diekel, and as a captain, he sees
it as his job to win big matches for his
team.

“I’m a captain now,” Thomusseit
said. “When the team needs someone
to step up, that’s my job.”

A fellow senior and captain, No. 8,
125-pound Anthony Zanetta, picked

up a big win for the Panthers as well.

Zanetta started the dual off with his
«7-6 decision over Lehigh’s Darian Cruz.

Although the match wasn’t on the
line, his win was integral, considering
the overall tightness of the match. Also,
there is a natural pressure placed on a
team’s 125-pound wrestler during the
first weight class to set the tone for
the match.

Despite the importance of his open-
ing match, Zanetta says he avoids the
pressure by focusing on his opponent.

“I don’t really think there is pres-
sure on me as the starter,”Zanetta said.
“Pressure is something that only you
can control. I try not to put unnecessary
pressure .on myself.” '

However, Zanetta’s early win didn’t

end of the first quarter. a .

Chris Blewitt connected on a 43-yard
ﬁeld goal shortly after the second quar-
ter began, and Pitt took its first lead of
the game two drives later. Tom Savage
capped a 10-play, 70-yard drive with
a 7~yard touchdown pass to Manasseh
Garner. ‘

Syracuse responded with a ﬁeld goal
before the half to bring the score to
1O‘9. '

The two teams each scored in the
third quarter, and Syracuse quarterback
Terrel Hunt found Alvin Cornelius for a
42-yard touchdown. Pitt answered with
a nine—play, 88-yard drive with a 5—yard
touchdown run by Isaac Bennett as the
third ended. ~

Pitt and Syracuse engaged in a battle
of attrition in the fourth. Neither team
scored, and Pitt sought revenge for the
14-13 loss at the Carrier Dome in Syra-
cuse, N.Y., last season.

Pitt’s highest—ranked wrestler, Tho-
musseit, came through when his team
needed him.

“I wrestle my match, which is strong
offense and trying to never let anyone
score points,” he said. “IfI can do that
every match, the bonus points will
come.”

With the lead narrowed to five
points, 15-10, the Panthers just needed
decisions in their ﬁnal two matches.

just 22 seconds into the sudden—vic-
tory overtime period, Pitt’s No. 19 Nick
Bonaccorsi scored a takedown to earn a
3-1 SV win over Lehigh’s John Bolich at

. 197 pounds, putting all the pressure on
. senior heavyweight P.J. Tasser.

As he will for most of the 2013
season, Tasser is wrestling about 60
pounds under his heavyweight competi-
tors. The heavyweight weight class is
capped at 285 pounds. Although most
heavyweight wrestlers are just under

that number, Tasser weighs signifi-

cantly less. A

“I just think other teams think it’s
kind of a joke,” Tasser said. “I don’t
think they realize I’m here to compete

no matter what weight I’m wrestling.”

If opposing teams continue to down-
play Tasser’s abilities, he will continue
to surprise opposing teams.

In the second sudden-victory period,
Tasser scored a takedown of Lehigh’s
Doug Vollaro to pick up the 4-2 SV2
victory and the 16-15 Pitt victory.

“I wasjust able to push the pace the
entire match,” Tasser said. “I kept at-
tacking and forced a scramble late in
overtime, where I was able to come out
on top.”

Unlike his fellow senior and captain

' Zanetta, Tasser felt the pressure of hav-

ing the team’s fate in his hands.

f‘The pressure is pretty crazy, espe-
cially when it comes down to if I win, the
team wins,” he said. “But it’s definitely
awesome to experience.” a
