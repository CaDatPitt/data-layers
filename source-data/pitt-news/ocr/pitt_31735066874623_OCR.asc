As Answer to Problems

By JACK

OLENDER

Are political parties the answer to Pitt student govern-
ment problems? Men’s Council is fostering a plan to make

political parties ofﬁcial at Pitt.

They have delegated a com-

mittee headed by Don Gartner, Col. ’56, to" submit a proposal

for a new system to the other
to the administration.

student governing bodies and

The proposed change wo‘uld effect only male ofﬁce-seek-I

ers (Men’s Council, delegates‘ to Student Congress, and.

class oflicers),while women officials would not be organized

into parties. '
Men’s Council supports

their plan with the results of a

query of party systems in other universities. They report

that the great majority have found them to be success-

ful. .

Student Congress president,
Emil Herman, Col. ’55, reports.
that of twenty schools repre-
sented at the National Student
Association Conference ‘seven-

feelings toward their system to .
be enthusiastic.

The main hurdle facing Pitt
political parties looms in the Uni-
versity administration. The Dean
of Men‘s office has not voiced its
opinion in the matter, and is wait-
ing for further information. Dean
of Women Helen P. Rush feels
that political parties wil not serve
tor the betterment of the school.
She mainains that.parties will be
more interested in winning elec-
ions than in working.

Dean Rush Questioned

In answer to the charge that a
party system will stimulate inter-
es in poliics, Dean Rush feels that
it is not necessary to “trump up
differences” in order to create in-
terest but that there are other
more effective measures that can
be taken that are .more in ‘accord

with concern for the good of the
school.

The parties question is tenta-
tively scheduled for discussion
in SC nex Monday. From the
number ofstudent leaders who.
have so far expresed opinions
favorable ‘to the matter, it seems
that the proposal will find little
opposition from student govern-
ment.

Herman points out four ways

in which he « believes political
parties can benefit Pitt. “Interest
in government will be stimulated,
‘government will become more
responsible, cliques will be broken
up and party activity will come
out into the open;‘-and it will pro-
vide ‘an educational experience
in civic responsibility. We are liv-
ing in a political. age, and the
school should try to train students
to take part in civic affairs.’ ”
Exising. rarties Hit

Bob Dickinson,'Eng. ’55, senior
e n g i nwe e r i ng representative to
Men’s C o u n c i l criticizes the
“catch-as—catch-can” activities of
the unofficial parties now exist-
ing. He sees “with political parties
a formal code of behavior. Only
with a "strong student government
can we convey the student feeling
to"the' faculty. Thankiheaven the

_ A great number of observers
are criticizing the dominant role
fraternities have played in stu-
dent politics. Paul Petro, a sen-
ior member of Student Congress
and chairman of the Assemblies
Committee describes student
politics at Pitt as a “contest
, among fraternities and to a
more dignified _extent—-soror-
ities. I think participation in
student politics should be on a
better basis than membership in
a Greek,’ or an Independent, or
any other organization.” About
the proposed party system, he
thinks “. .~ . it’s worth the.try.”.

Dgn Kettering, president of In-

-ter-Fraternity Council, and Joe

Banik, president‘ of the Independ-
ent As-sociation; both expressed
favorable opinions on the ‘worth
of a party system in SC and Men’s
Council.
Decision Within Week«

- Within the next week a decision
probably will be made on one of
the most thought-provoking ‘and
interesting questions to arise_ in
the Universiy. Perhaps “a party

tive means to remove the apathy
now being shown toward respon-
sible student government. Or
maybe a mere awakening to duty
is all that is necessary. This will
be ~decided by the pebple. who
have the interests of the Univer--
sity at heart.

Pitt History Professor
Tells of World Travels

By BETTY SKENDER
. Dr. Leland DeWitt Baldwin, editor, writer and historian,
feels _that Senator Joseph McCarthy has damaged the cause
of freedom here in the non-communist world’ more than that
of any Communist propaganda. Dr. Baldwin has recently
returned from a two year leave of absence from the Pitt
history department. He spent the time traveling abroad and

teaching.

From 1952 to 1953 Dr. Baldwin was a Fulbright Pro-
fessor at the University of Leeds in England. The following
summer he spent traveling on the continent. His travels
included a four month stay in Pakistan, India, and Salon,
where he lectured. From there he went to‘South-east Asia,
through Australia and New Zealand, and back up to the

Philippines, Hong Kong, and

Japan. Dr. Baldwin traveled

as a‘State Department lecturer of
the United States - Information

English Anti-‘American

5 ' From his stay in England, Dr. V
__Baldwin feels that the English are

generally anti—American, and
would be more so if they didn’t

. need our help. “The English don”:

like the American ways or civili-

efhatioii, and they are very deteri-
1 mental to it,”,explains Dr. Bald-

win. He fee-ls thatall nations are
enviousof the United States which
is young and untired politically.

_i And that due to the relative de-
I cline of Europe and the Asiatic

nations, in particular, they conse-
quently emphasize their old civili-

O‘ zations, and try to find reasons to

reject the United States as a dis-
urbing element.

Dr.»Baldwin explains that the
other nations have never experi-
enced freedom in its fullest as we
have, so they don’t really under-
stand the threat of communism

and what is would mean to be -

under the communist rule. .
Teaching Method Differs

The relationship between teach-
er and student is quite different
in England than here in America,
especially the method of teaching.

O ’ The English believe in the saying,

“throw the student in and he will
either sink or swim.” What and
how much the student learns is
therefore up to him. The student

. does all his work in outside read-

ing assignments and depends very
little on the professor »for help.
There is one lecture a week in the
course chosen, and it is to the
students discretion that he attends.
The English student is spe-
cialized to an extreme extent
because ‘ his readings " usually
cover only what is his major.
There _ is only one exam given
for a course, andthe course may
last for one, two, or five. years.
If the student fails the exam, he-
therefore fails the course.
,Dr. Baldwin feels that this sys-
'tem is poor for the average. student

' because he usually needshelp and

guidance, whereas, it is excellent
for the brilliant student who can
progress entirely on his own. The
English students are not permitted
to work because they. are expected
to spend all their time studying.
Nations Envious of U.S.
Thefgeneral opinion of the Eng-

~ lish student is that he is better

than the American student. “They
dislike he American culure and
posterity to such an extent that
they are searching for a reason to
ﬂatter themselves, to give to them-
selves the security that the Ameri-
can "student and people as a whole
have,” Dr. Baldwin said.

While teaching American His-
tory at Leeds, he found that the
English students ’know abso-
lutely nothing about American
history. They feel that Amer-p
ica has no history because it is
so young, and they regard all
current history as politics.

After Dr. Baldwin received his

Ph. D. at the University of Michi-
gan in 1932, he came to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Since that
time he has been Assisant Director
in charge of research, editoraof the
University of Pittsburgh Press,
and acting librarian of our library,

Professor of history.

Mayor David L. Lawrence will
attend the private dedication
ceremony to ofﬁcially open the
Schenley-Croghan room on the
first ﬂoor of the University, Sﬂn-u
day, Jan. 9. William S. Miller,
president of the Steelwood Cor-
poration will present the original
materials of two rooms of a his-
toric mansion to Chancellor Fitz-
gerald in honor of his father, the
late Herschel Miller, master build-
er in Pittsburgh for 50 years.

The newest of Pitt’s specially
designed rooms,‘ The Ballroom

- and the Oval Room, were for-

merly part of the Croghan man-
sion which stood on the present
‘site of the Stanton Heights Golf
Course.

Mr. Miller purchased the Crog-
han mansion and property from
the Schenley family after the sec-
ond world war. The two rooms,
now in Pitt, represent a recon-
struction of early Pennsylvania
rooms of the Greek classical re-
vival period. The Metropolitan
Museum wished to add them to
its collection. However, they rep--
resent a part of Pittsburgh his-

Built in 1830
The Croghan mansion was built
early in the 1830’s by Colonel Wil-
liam Croghan. At ﬁrst it was

erected solely for entertainment’

and was named “The Picnic
House.” It contained the ballroom,
now at Pitt, and three bedrooms.
Soon after, the Colonel's "daughter,
Mary Groghan eloped with Cap-
tain Schenley, an English officer.
The much dissolusioned Colbnel,
in ‘hope of wooing his daughter
back from her new homeland of

England built an addition which »

contained living quarters. Seven
or eight years later Mary returned
for a visit for one year. After the

Brittain said, “Dr. Kannwischer T

will be an ideal teacher for such a
course because of his training in
both theology and philosophy.”
This new course will be added
to the list of ' subjects open to

Since religion is not-a depart-

E XCUSe Me .
ByJim Deweese 
A few- weeks ago this writer mentioned that
the social graces seem to be lacking entirely at "the
University of Pittsburgh. Here then are a few

tips on some of the more delicate phases of cour-
tesy' between collegiate students.

The press of humanity waiting breathlessly for
the coming of an elevator gives birth to a number
of situations which lend them-
selves to a display of courtesy.
The prime example of‘ the typi-
cal galantless slob may be viewed
here in all his glory as he darts
from one door to the next in
eager expectation. He conveys
the impression of an impatient
wire-haired terrier caught be-
tween four widely space ﬁre
plugs.

Once inside the elevator he takes a firm stand
in the approximate center of the car, declining to_
move either right or left to facilitate the entrance
or exit of a fellow passenger. His own exit is best
staged when the car is full and he is standing near

_the rear. He will not say “Excuse me,” or “Pardon
me.” No warden would. Instead he times his exit
to coincide with the closing of the door at which
time he erupts along with a cloud of notebooks,
purses, and slide rules. 

Revolfing Revolutions

The revolving doors present a unique problem
in etiquette. P Opinions differ on this moving sub-
ject but the correct procedure when converging
with a membergof the opposite sex at one of these
glass covered tunrstiles is to give the door a gentle
push to get it moving, then shove your partner
into the gape and grab the bar of the next door.

 

A good stiff shove at this stage can result in the
gratifying sound made by cloth catching in the
door. This sound can only be heard in revolving
doors. Thus it is unique and much sought after.
This accounts for the turbine like motions of these
doors during rush hours (and biddle hours too for
that matter).

Monnerly Mosficai-ion

The tobacco cult poses another problem. I once
knew a frat man who innocently offered cigarettes
to a group to which he was talking. Fortunately
he also chews gum. But you can light the thing
for a girl even if you don’t have any matches.
Standard operating procedure is to wait until she
produces matches and has hung the ﬁlter tipped
cylinder at the proper angle. Then grab for the
matches. She probably won’t' let go. Use both
hands if necessary. "

Chances are good that the match will ignite

while you both have ﬁrm grips on the book. The‘

resultant ﬂare will probably fuse your hands to-
gether and everyone will think you’re pinned.
Don’t pay any attention. Those things don’t usu-
ally last much longer than cigarettes anyway.
No More"Coc'l' Goats

Holding a girl’s coat seems a lost art. Of course
girls don’t engage in ﬁstic battles much anymore
but it is still considered considerate to palm the
threads while the lady climbs. into them. She will
probably think you are an egocentric purse snatch.
er and clout you with a, sandwich ‘but you will go
down with satisfaction written all over your puzzled
face.

Courtesy is not dead. Rather dormant. But a
thing towhich each man should give considerable
thought. As Emerson once wrote, “Your manners
are always under examination, and by committees
little expected . . . who are awarding or denying
you very high prizes when. you least think of it.”

Only One Oul-lei

The main outlet for student
creativeness is “Manuscripts,”
published once a year. ‘Its 32
pages are not adequate for a
thorough sampling of student
talent.

Pitt’s only magazine is the
“Skyscraper Engineer,” and
rarely do people outside of the
engineering ﬁeld contribute to
it. Most of the articles are onia
technical plane, more explana-
tory than creative.

Other schools have proved

This action augments similar
restrictions passed in 1952 con-
ﬁning all Russians to within 25
miles oflthe. centers of Wash-
ington and New York.

Those affected must" give 48
hours advance notice of planned
travel outside this area.

Ithas been suggested that if
and when the Kremlin is ready
tovdo likewise, the United States

‘government would consider eas-

ing up on its travel regulations.

Do two wrongs make a right?
An eye for an eye and a re-
striction for a’ restriction is not
the path toward world peace.
It will not smooth relations be-
tween our two countries.

When the Japanese devised

their tourture chambers during
World War II, Americans did
not retaliate with identical ac-
tion. When the Communists in
China today jail foreign “spies”
for treason, we do not recipro-

cate with similar forced confes-’

sions from their visitors in this

country. This would be against

the ideals on which the United
States is based.
In our national anthem we

proudly call ourselves “the land"

of the free.” Are we practicing
what we preach when we refuse

a foreigner the right of free_

movement? All Russians are not

communists, just as all Germans?

dent » apathy, and student en-
thusiasm by banning the maga;

Assembling this new humor
magazine would be an excellent
opportunity for students. in
business . administration and
journalism. It would give them
the practice in handling money,
soliciting ads, and doing maga-
zine layout that is almost nec-
essary for a post-graduation job
in the over-crowded journalism
ﬁeld. ‘

. Does our government plan to
include Russian exiles escaping
from the tyranny of Commun-
ism? The moment they enter
the United States they automati-
cally come under the phrase “all
resident Soviet citizens.” As
such, they may not be permitted

to join families and relatives in

the banned areas.

Emma Lazarus symbolized the
United States in her The New
Colossus written on the Statue
of Liberty:

...From her beacon-hand

Glorious world-wide welcome

...Give me your tired, your

poor,

Your huddled masses yearning

to breathe free

Our “world-wide welcome”
has been revoked by our State
Department with a single note.
Our free air has been tainted.

If “reciprocity and security”
precautions need be taken, im-
mediate strategic areas and not
whole’ communities should be
barred from visitors.

But no infraction of the
American heritage of freedom
should ever be permitted. In-
stead of setting for the world
an example 0 “a land of the
free and the home of the brave,”
we are copying the identical
communistic controls which we
so strongly criticize.

counts, 81-79 and 74-70‘.

On Monday evening the Frosh

will again tangle with the Du- r

quesne freshman squad-——this time
at the Gardens. The Panther Cubs
hope to duplicate the one-sided
victory they scored over the Lit-
le Dukes earlier this season.

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Coach Rex Perry will‘ unveil an inexperienced, sopho-
more-laden wrestling team against the Michigan State
Spartansat East Lansing tomorrow evening with no less

than ﬁve second-year men on

the starting team.

Thus, the Panther mat mentor has reason to take a. rather

-pessimistic View of the Blue and Gold’s chances against the

well-balanced forces of the third ranking team in the Big Ten.

“They had a tough team last‘:
 P year,” commented Peery, “and it’s 

almost certain they will be plenty
tough tomorrow.” Incidentally, the
Panther matmen downed the
Spartans last year, 21-9.

Unfortunately, the locals have
been hurt by a wave of early sea-
son injuries with the latest casu-
alty being Joe ‘Solomon, NCAA
167-pound champ’ and runnerup
in the EIWA tourney.

Solomon suffered an eye injury
in an alumni tournament at Can-
onsburg and may miss the opener.
If he is ordered to sit this one out,
he will be replaced by .soph Ron-
iald Schirf of Latrobe.

Elimination matches were held
this week to determine the start-
ing squad that will face the Stat-
ers. Many of he grapplers were
shifted to other weight , classes
than they are normally accustom-
ed to in an effort to bolster the
team strength. .

,Ine_the l23—pound class, soph Ed
Perry of Shaler Township came
out on- top. Sophomore Bill Hul-

ings, who was decisioned by Pe-rry, l :2

moved up a ‘notch; to the 130-
pound class where he will repre-
sent Skyscraper U. _

The 137-pound starting assign-
ment has gone to Nick Swentow-
sky, a sophomore from Carnegie
since veteran Bill Kozy was in-
jured in the Wilkes Tdurney.

A mild upset occurred in the
147—pound division when sopho-
more George Ulassin. of Munhall
decisioned letterman Bob Cook
who won all three of his matches
last year. Cook then moved up to
the 157-pound division where he
subdued Don Hull‘ to be the locals’

‘representative at that weight.

The 167-pound starting position
will be filled by junior Ed DeWit1:
of Washirigton who last season
won nine straight dual meets and
posted an overall record of 13
wins and two losses in addition to
being runnerup in the EIWA tour-
ney.

and Ed Pavlick will have a real
job on their hands. Besides try-
ing to stop these two from scoring
and at the same time get their
share of rebounds, the Panther pair
will also have to find time to do
some scoring themselves.

Oddly enough, the guy that just
might help make their job easier
is a little man—6-0 Jxoe Fenwick.
With Fenwick drawing the de-
fense out with his outside shooting

Thejunior guard is easily Coach
Timmons’ best set shotbut up till

on outside shoting, ‘ Fenwick, by
taking more shots, could loosen

In‘ this latest outing against
Geneva, the locals put on what

Kurtz Loss   ,
Hurts This Year

By DAVE MAZER p ,
Sports Editor

 

Although it may not sound right to the average fan,
wrestling coaches say that more injuries are incurred in
football proportionately than in collegiate wrestling. _

But they’ll also say that when an injury occurs in the
mat game, it usually presents more of a problem than in
the fall sport for the simple reason that the gridders have
three or four replacements at every position and the matmen
don’t. _ '

One particular disability that will hurt this year’s wrest-i

lers as they open their season tomorrow night is the unusual
injury to junior Ronnie Kurtz. -

A very promising sophomore last year, Kurtz received
a shoulder injury in the Yale match in February and hasn’t
wrestled since. At first it was just an ordinary ailment, but
later it developed complications“?

_by" playing
several of the squash clubs in the

in the shoulder and which still

Up to the time of this, the 130-‘
‘pounder from

Waynesburg had
won all five of his matches and
was one of the big reasons for
the Panthers winning their first
six dual meets; ‘

The next match after the injury
-——Michigan———the matmen lost
mainly because Coach Rex Peery
had taken Kurtz to AnnaArbor but

. learned in‘ the pre-game wartnups
that the shoulder was bothersome

and withdrew the little Wrestler.

There was no one to replace
Kurtz at the last minute and the
result was a 16-11 defeat for the
Pittites. It was soon learned that
Kurtz would be out the remainder
of the season but it was hoped,
that this year would find him on‘
the mats again.’_

Last season, luckily, the Pan-
thers had enough depth to replace
Kurtz and still go on to win the

rest of their dual meets plus first.

at the Nationals.

Coach Peery does not have many

loss is really damaging.

According to Peery, Kurtz is
“one of.the best in the country.

Newest Winter Varsity Sports
Practicing for Navy Openers -

By AL

PELAEZ

Both of the newest additions to Pitt's varsity athletic
program, squash and gymnastics, are putting the ﬁnishing
touches on preparations for their opening meets with Navy,

January 29.

Squash coach Jim Tully

is faced with the problem of

selecting a nine-man team to face.-3

Navy in the opening encounter,
whereas only five men will play
in the other matches.

At present, Pat Hughes, Alan
Humphreys, Milt Emery, Len
Reeves, Neal Zweig, Herb Thomp-
son, and Barry Smith are expected
to carry the brunt of the load dur-
ing the coming“ season. All have
looked very good in practice ses-
sions thus far, and have been
gaining valuable match experience

Coach Tuly, although refusing
to be optimistic, admitted that,

“The boys h-ave been working‘

hard and have shaped up much
better than I had'expected.” This
should indicateothat the Panthers
will give their opposition a tough
battle in all of this season’s
matches.

Coach Warren‘ Nieger’s tum-

blers, who have just been accepted '
into the Eastern Intercollegiate 5

Gymnastic League, will, in the
opinion of their, coach, “Be greatly

he added.

The mainstays "of the sqaud are
expected to be Joe Lamartine, Bob

who will work on the high bars,

Bob Kennedy and Will Starz in
the tumbling events; and Keith

IPegues Leaﬂs PantherH it Paradox

 

By BERNIE MORRIS

Panther faithfuls are humming
the tune “Oklahoma” these days
for a very good reason. No. its not
because the stage play is due to
run at the Nixon, but because the
Sooner State has contributed one

of the most promising freshmen
ever to don the Blue and Gold.
Julius Pegues, a lean 6-31/2
athlete who gives notice that he
may become one of Pitt’s greatest,
has drawn the raves and plaudits
of the local fans for his spectcular
performances on the hardwood
this season. ~
Currently performing for Carl
Peterson’s freshman quintet, “Pig-
gie”, has accounted for 119 points
i.n helping to lead the fresh to six
victories without a loss.

I-Coac-h Peterson paid the lad

_ quite a tribute recently when he

said..“He’s a fine youth, one of the
nicest boys you’d ever want on.
your squad, and he’s the type of.
boy who should improve his

‘ basketball ability because he’s
M willing to listen and heed advice.”

The soft—spoken youth hails
from Tulsa and attended Booker
‘T. Washington High which had an
enrollment of 650 students. There‘
he played three years of varsity
ball and helped lead the tiny
school to two Oklahoma state
championships. ' ~

Pegues’ tale is a real success
story. He wanted very much to
take up pre-med and Pitt was
recommended to him by a former;
