Cats Face MtUnion WedAtFH

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

Make no mistake about it. Pitt's
Bill Knight was born to play bas-

V ‘ Tketball, He was undoubtedly en-

dowed with the inborn traits.
otherwise known as natural abil-
ity. tha-.t_ other men labor. sweat.

Knight opened up

a lot of eyes. and “"5"”

2  I 5‘-before..touching a ball on _a colleg
I ate court. he was touted as an All

American honorable mention.

 

After a fine sophomore year,
where he scored 505 points—aver-
aging 21 points a game and shoot-
ing'53.8 per cent (a Pitt record),
recovered 276‘ rebounds, chipped
in '56 assists, and picked up 91
loose balls, “Mooney” didn’t let
his boosters down. Again, he has
received honorable mention.

Coming out of Braddock High
School here in Pittsburgh. Bill
found a whole new world of public
relations. desiring to vault his
name coast-to—coast. awaiting
him. With a little help from the
Pitt schedule. that has happened
too;

Here is what a few opposing

coaches have said about him:
Norm Sloan
(North Carolina State)

"He is going to be one of the
great college players in the coun-
try and I'd say he's very much a
candidate for All-American hon-
ors over the next twoyears."

John Bach (Penn State)

“Indeed a picture player."

“The kind of ballplayer you
drive miles to see. If people want
to see a potential superstar. there
he is.“

Being truly humble for a man
in his position. “.\/Iooney" just
doesn't know how to take all this
hub-bub. Of course. he wants to
fill his expectations. but oh that
pressure.

"I try not to think about it. but
it adds pressure on me.“ he com-
mented. about all the nice things
being said about him. ‘‘I don‘t
know if I am consistent enough
yet to be that good."

Sitting in on a recent Field
House practice session Moe Beck-
er, his high school coach, remem-
bers teaching Billy Knight.

"He had so much raw basket-
ball talent.“ Becker recollected.
"You don't teach a Knight how to
play_bask-etball. butt I helped him
bring it’all together-E“ '  

One thing Knight lacked. ac-
cording to Becker. was the abil-
ity to go after a rebound.

“I used to drill into his head
that he was a hungry animal and
that the ball was a piece of meat,”
uncovered his former coach. “I
really had him go after it.”

Now. there is no doubt that Bill
can clear the boards.

And though Knight didn’y really
think of the ball as meat. Becker
used to take him and teammate
Carl Morris out for a corn beef
sandwich after practice. just in
case.

‘‘I like corn beef," “Mooney”
said. “Yeah, corn beef on white
bread.”

Does Knight know that Jewish
folks think corn beef goes best
with rye bread‘?

, "Yeah. I know. Thats why I
specify white
know I'm not Jewish." he humor-
ed.

On the court, Knight does a cou-
ple of things that rouses the curi-

eight

Grgurich, Fran Webster, Charles “Buzz" Ridl. Mark Disco missing. ‘

After a Piece of Meat?

s

‘ olsitly of..the people who watch him

play. He always has a smile plast-
ered on his round face and always
steps backwards after he shoots
the ball.

"I. don't know I‘m smiling.
Some of the freshmen used to
want to know why I was smiling at
them. but I didnt think I was."
Becker knows why.

“Put a basketball in Billy‘s
hands and he will automatically
smile. He loves to play basketball.
If he had ‘his way. that's all he

I would do. That‘s why he smiles."

After a shot, you are supposed
to move forward and follow your
shot. Knight is so confident that
he precludes a score.

"I guess that's my way of hop-~

ing it goes in." he confessed. "I
know I‘ve got to step up and fol-
low my shot."

Because he played three posi-
tions last year (guard. forward.
and swing-man). he had a lot of
defenses to learn. As a result. his
overall defensive work suffered.
And while he led the team in re-
covering loose balls. often he was

‘in the wrong place.

“It seemed I was in the right
place at the right time. The ball

just seemed to fall in my hands, a

but, I didn’t know the system that
well then,” Knight analyzed.

Part of defensive assistant Fran
Webster's job this year will be to
help Bill control his instinct. Con-
centrating on the swing-man posi-
tion this year. the problem should
be ironed out. For. if anyone on
the Pitt team can swing. Knight
would have to be the one.

At the helm of the potentially
good Pitt season will be Knight.
He is the touted one. the All-
American candidate. the leader.
The pressureis on. ' * ‘

“Hey, tell all the press ‘people
to take it easy this year. I don’t
know what kind of year I’m going
to have,” he chided, before leav-
ing the interview.

Unless the game of basketball
has changed drastically since last
year. a lot of people think Bill will
have a heck of a year. And. they
will be writing about it.

Sorry "Mooney. '”

Cots Face Mt. Union, Rule Changes

  Upsforf Ohioans
Look For Pill

V , g by VINCE Di NARDO
 . Wednesday night the Pitt bas-
 c ’ ketball tandom will open this sea-
son with what is expected to be
the first win of the season against
»  AMt. Union College, starting at 8

 ;p.m. at the Pitt Field House.

V .0ut of Alliance. Ohio. Mt. Uri-
) ion isn‘t a noted basketball power.
The game could be called a
 "breather" ‘as the Cats are sup-
 posed to romp.

. The key to the scheduling of the
' “game lies not with Pitt wanting an
_,-easy one to start with. but with
V" the intentions of the upstart Un-
 ..io‘nites. ,
 Possessing 4,000 full time stu-
-_ dents, Mt. Union is a small college

3-that has high basketball inten-
' tions.-- - 

 

  

  
  
  
  
    
   
  
  
  

g The Unionites have lost only
"one game of their last six—-that a
two point loss at the buzzer. They
,.al's_o managed to beat Edigggro
= College last year. Edinboro vvient
_ .‘-*on to "win big in the state's small
7icolle'ge ranks.

'\ -' . .

“They're a real good small col-
lege." commented assistant
coach Fran Webster. "There are
a lot of good basketball players
around. I‘m sure they have some.
They aren‘t coming up here so we
can whip them. They have inten-
tions of whipping us. "

Buzz Ridl, who put himself out
on a limb a year ago by predict-
ing a tournament for the Cats,
isn’t willing to make the same mis-
take. ‘

"Yes. they seemed real anxious
to play us." he said. with a con-
cerned look on his face.

Ridl. a low keyed.-almost stoic

leader. isn‘t going to take any

game for granted this year. Des-
pite this fact. the game promises
to be the greatest mismatch in
this area since the Pitt-Ohio Wes-
leyan game a year ago and since
the Duquesne Dukes took on a
school by the name of Roanoke.

The Mt. Unions have a sharp-
shooting 6’9” center, who is sup-
posed to be a scoring threat. The

lad, named Lawrence, will carry
any hopes the Ohioans have of an
upset.

To counteract him. Ridl will use
one of the more talented squads
in recent Pitt history.

Bill Knight will probably start
as a swing man and Ken Wagoner
will anchor the guard position.
Mickey Martin and Jim Bolla are
probable starters at forwards.
Bill Sulkowski is leading at the
center position (these were prob-
able starters as of Monday. Nov.
21).

Lucius Ke_ese (center), Kirk
Bruce (guard), Carl Morris (for-
ward) are also slated to see a lot
of action.

If the Cats jump out to the big
lead. Ridl might empty the bench
to give everyone some exposure.

“We should be the favorites.“
said Webster.

.Mongine:. Medical Vet I

Applying an ice pack. taping an
ankle. or just plain providing wa-
ter for a thirsty bunch of practic-
ing, basketball players. Pitt train-
er Bobby Mangine does it all.

Mangine. who spends some of
his time going to classes at Pitt.
has a knack of soothing minor
hurts. as any good "trainer is sup-

' posed to.

.He has been at Pitt for five
years in that capacity. the first as
a senior in high school.

Out of North Catholic High
School, Bob plans to keep making
his trade a career. And, if he isn’t

trying to outduel assistant coach

Tim Grgurich on the basketball
court, Mangine finds time to run
away from Sam Fleming squirting
water bottle. All this jostling

comes after all the work isdone,
of course.

peedup Sought
From New Laws,

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

In an effort to establish a faster game with less theatrics. or more
simply put. a game with “more action and less acting." the Rules
Committee of Intercollegiate Basketball has added a few new rules
that will be put into effect in the 1972-73 hoop season.

The most important of these changes concerns the free throw at-
tempts given for the first six common personal fouls for each squad in
each of the two halls of the contest.

The Rules Committee has eliminated all of these free throw at-
tempts and in their place will adminster violations.

The offended team will take the ball out of bounds nearest the spot
where the violation took place. Unlike a normal violation, however, each
player who makes a foul in this way will be assessed a personal foul.

The creation of this new rule on foul shooting does not,.c0mpletely

' eliminate any free throw attempts before the one-on-one bonus situa-

tion exists. .

The free throw will remain in effect for flagrant and intentional
fouls. the foul which is committed against an individual attempting a
field goal. and for the double or for the multiple foul.

According to the committee the overall playing time of a basket-
ball game will be cut from five to seven minutes.

“I think it’ll make it a faster game." agreed Pitt’s head basket-
ball coach Buzz Ridl. “Also the scores should be lower by eliminating
these fouls. You won’t be able toscore with the clock stopped."

In addition to the new ruling on foul shooting. the Rules Committee
has issued a strong warning about attempting to fake fouls.

“The chief reason for such an announcement is that more and more

during the recent seaons, players‘have attempted to create the false
impression that they have been fouled in charging-guard situations. or
while screening when the contact was only ‘incidental. ”

Players suspected of “acting” will be charged with a technical foul
for unsportsmanlike conduct.

There has also been a change in the three seconds limit in the lanes .

of the basketball court. t

It used to be that a three seconds violation could be called in the
back court as well as the front court. The new ruling now states that
this violation will only apply when the ball is in the front court.

Both Ridl and his assistant coach Fran Webster are satisfied with
the changes brought on by the Rules Committee. ‘

Ridl feels that it has been well accepted by, college coaches in gen-
eral and as far as his own players’ views on the changes Ridl comment-
ed. "I think that they really like it. Generally they just accept the rules
and let the coaches worry about it."

he’_s earned -from his patients.
You see, because he has so much
information, he was nicknamed
Bobby Bull—. ~

Always up on the latest hoop
facts. Mangine often volunteers
information which makes sports
writing a little easier.

. Before the daily Pitt practice
starts, he is up to his “big” mouth
in tape. Why, he uses a ton of tape
on Jim Bolla alone.

_ No insult is meant about Bob-
by’s mouth, but that’s- just a tag

Extremely capable of doing his
job. however, Bobby is the first
one the hoopsters run towhen in
pain. '

Isn't that what a trainer is for‘?
