Regulations Proposed For
NCAA Athletic Scholarships

By MARK A. SINDLER

Student athletes on scholarships
would be subject to more stringent
entrance requirements under legis-
lation proposed by the American
Association of Universities panel,
Pitt chancelor Wesley Posvar told
the University Senate Wednesday.

The legislation, developed by a
panel of 28 college presidents, will
be submitted to the National Colle-
giate Athletic Association in Janu-
ary, Posv_ar said.

Student athletes would have to
maintain a 2.0 quality point aver-
age in 11 specified courses while in
high school, acquire a 2.0 average
overall and attain at least a com-
bined Scholastic Aptitude Test
score of 700, ‘according to the
proposal.

“In addition, while in college,

there should be normal progress

toward a degree in courses relevant
to that degree,” Posvar said.

Concerning freshmen eligibil-
ity, Posvar said: “On the face of it,
people say you can eliminate most
of the ills of,athletics by making

freshmen ineligible to compete."

Posvarialso told the Senate that
Pitt is one of the leading institu-
tions dealing with long-range
planning and probably the only
one looking into systematic
planning. ’

()ne.potential prospect the
school is looking into is instruc-
tion through cable TV. This plan-
ning objective stipulates that
courses will be broadcast to only
those home subscribers who pay
tuition, he said.

Pitt also wants to increase fund-
ing for external research. The
monies for research have been
increasing over the last several
years but are leveling off this year,
Posvar said. The same can be said
for state funding that Governor
Thornburgh has been increasing
six to seven percent each year.

Pitt is also proposing to institute
enrollment ceilings on programs
exceeding enrollment goals: Busi-
ness, Engineering, Law, CAS and
SHRP.

Posvar added he wants to hold
tuition increases down through the
implenieritation of a deferred pay-
ment plan. ‘ '

In other business, the Senate
approved a new Community Rela-
tions Conimitee. The new commit-
tee will afford opportunities for
communication between faculty
members, administrationiand com-
munity leaders, Posvar said.

Its purpose is to establish:

0 A broader understanding of
the interdependence between Pitt.
local communities and institu-
tions.

0 A better understanding of
reciprocal needs and conflicts and
how complementary resources can
be instituted to redress these needs
and conflicts.

O The maintenance and growth
of mutual trust and good will.

The committee will not compete
with or supplant any objectives of
existing public relations or coin-
munity liaison offices at or near
Pitt.

Included among the coinmittee’s
work are informal weekly lunches;
these will be attended by an invited

community leader, various com-it

Board OKs Creation
of Foundation  

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The establishment of a Founda-
tion foi‘ Applied Science and Tech-
nology (FAST) was unanimously
approved yesterday by Pitt's Board
of Trustees at its fall meeting.

FAST. a non-profit organiza-
tion, will serve to aid in the devel-
opment of cooperative research
and development projects between
the university faculty and indus-

tries. It will also provide a means '

by which the university can
acquire an ownership position in
products resultingifrcim research.

FAST will be a complement to
the now existing Center for Ap-
plied Science and Technology
(CAST). While CAST’s purpose is
to promote federally-funded
research projects, FAST will do the
same in the private sector.

The project will use the same
personnel and occupy the same
offices as CAST, currently located
in the Mineral Industries Building,
according to the FAST Planning
and Resource Management Sys-
tein’s details concerning the
foundation.

This will also allow faculty
members who independently
devise patentable inventions to
pursue them through FAST’s pat-

ent committee as an alternative to
the university’s patent committee.

“University scientists have tradi-
tionally conducted most of the
basic, far-sighted, open-ended
research in the country," chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar said. “With the
establishment of FAST, we have
created a mechanism for the sup-
port of technological innovation
which extends from conceptual
innovation through proof of
feasibility.

“In other words, the University
of Pittsburgh is now committing
itself to linking basic and applied
research in order to accelerate
benefits to society."

Investigators from all areas of
the university will have the oppor-
tunity to participate in and avail
themselves of the services and pro-
grams available throug the
Foundation.

“We believe that this foundation
will add relevance to our educa-
tional mission by offering students
exposure to applied research pro-
jects,” Posvar said.

In his chancellor’s report, Posvar
announced the establishment of a
new department of theatrearts, an
off—shoot of the former department
of speech and theatre arts.

The University of Pitts-
burgh related hospitals have
gained world recognition for
their innovations with organ
transplants. Patients from all
over the country get the chance
to start their lives over again
with a new liver, kidney or
heart.

Aside from the psychological
problems these patients face,
they also have to deal with the
monetary burdens. of which
hospital bills are only a part.

Some families must wait
months until an acceptable
donor is found. This means
they need a place to sleep every
night-—a place that will serve as
a temporary home until the
patient is well enough to go
home.-

In an attempt to help patients
and their families deal with this
extra burden, the University
Health Center has made plans
to renovate two houses on
McKee Place.

Jeri Frizza, an administrative
assistant in the Hea’lth’s Cen-

Houses Available for
Patients and Families

ter’s planning office, said that
there is a 145 percent capacity
demand for houses such as this,
according to a market analysis.

Patients waiting for trans-
plants or families of patients in
the hospital will be able to rent
these rooms at $24 a night,
Frizza said.

Single rooms at the Univer-
sity Inn range from $53-$65 dol-
lars a night, double rooms go
for $63-$75 dollars a night. Sc),
the housing set up by the Uni-
versity Health Center Wlll
relieve the financial burdens
somewhat.

Currently, there is a Ronald
McDonald House in Shadyside
that houses young patients and
their families. but there are no
houses for older patients. The
23 bedrooms in the two McKee
Place houses will be available to
older patients and their
families.

The houses are expected to
open in mid-l983, Frizza said.

is the University of Pittsburgh a ‘Party School?’

By BILL HESS

For many people, the most
important aspect of college is a
solid social life. Academic pres-
sures, dormitory living and tuition
payments all produce stress, and
parties are often the only mecha-
nisms that maintain sanity in an
otherwise deranged environ-
ment.

Here's how various Pitt people
responded to the question, “Is Pitt
a party school?"

Mike Flanigan,
Junior/CAS

Mike Flanigan, who has lived in
Pitt's dormitories for three years,
said that Pitt’s social structure
offers enough ﬂexibility to keep
students active.

“I'd say that any Thursday
through Saturday night, if you
want a good time, you can ﬁnd it
pretty easily here," he said,
adding that partying is well
spread throughout the dormito-
ries, fraternities, bars and off-
campus apartment buildings.

Flanigan said that Pitt's social
atmosphere is “just as good or
better" than that of -any other
school and students at Pitt make
friends easily. .

"When you go out with your

own group of friends to a party,-

there's always people there that
you don't know, but that's how
you get to know even more peo-
ple,” he said.

Flanigan said that some stu-'

dents stick to their high school

cliques, but most participate in

Pitt's social scene. 
"As far as protesting parties
altogether goes, I think that’s kind

of ridiculous, because that’s what ;

weekends are for," he said.
“(.ln'less you have a test on Mon-
day or somethi" '" vou want to go

FORUM

out and forget about school for a
while."

Flanigan also said that Pitt's
parties are well-controlled and
students who refuse to socialize
must still realize that parties are a
main element of college life.

“If someone's trying to study
and there's a party going on next
door, if he's really serious about it,
he won’t sit there complaining.
He'll get up and go someplace
that's quiet," said Flanigan,
adding that several university
buildings are kept open late at
night for this purpose.

Nancy Pallerino,
President, Kappa
Kappa   Gamma
Sorority

Nancy Pallerino said that par-
ties are secondary at Pitt; most
students place more emphasis
on their education. She feels this
is a sign that reﬂects the responsi-
bility of the student body.

"I don't think the social life here
is lacking," she said. “I think it just
shows that Pitt students know
how to balance their time well."

Pallerino said that since Pitt is
largely a commuter school, the
social life suffers more than at
‘other colleges.

"it especially hurts the sorori-
ties because it's tough to get
many commuting students to
come to our nighttime activities.
Womenare reluctant to come to
the campus. after dark." She
attributed this to Pitt's dangerous‘
location.

Pallerino said fraternities and
sororities at Pitt don't play as
large a social role as they do on
other campuses.

as one of responsi-bility. -

Jay Halli, Presi-

dent, RSA

Jay Nalli believes that the party
regulations at Pitt pose a serious
threat to campus social life.

"I went to Penn State last wee
kend, and it's a totally different
atmosphere out there," he said.
"Things are a lot looser because
they aren't as worried about rules,
guest lists, alternate beverages
andthose kinds of things. lt'sjust
people going out and having a
good time."

Halli said the restrictions on
dormitory and fraternity parties
have turned Pitt into a campus on
which "there's no good place to
have a party."

“its not worth it to plan a party
anymore," he said. "It's not really
worth it to go to one because it
probably won't be that good.
There are good parties here and
there, but to go around and have
to find parties just takes away
from the idea."

Halli believes the only way stu-
dents can improve the party situa-
tion at Pitt is by showing that they
are responsible in their use of
alcohol. The RSA, he said, is par-
ticipating in a study concerning
the effects of alcohol, and he
hopes the RSA candemonstrate
that Pitt students understand the
problems associ-ated with
drinking.

"in the past, the administration

— has been able to show that when

there are parties, people aren't
responsible, '
done and so on,” he said, adding
that if Pitt students can demon-

strate responsibility, the party res-

trictions may be lifted. ~

F. Morris White,
Freshman/CA8

F. Morris White, who came to
Pitt from New Hampshire, saidhe
expected Pitt to be a big party
school when he first arrived on
campus. However, he says most
social activities here center on
Oakland's bars.

Since Pitt's campus is sur-
rounded by bars, White said, it's
natural that on-campus parties
are secondary. Because of this,
he feels campus partying doesn't
cause problems.

"Every campus this size has
isolated incidents of problem par-
tying, but I don't think it's that
dangerous of a situation here,"
he said.

"i personally enjoy going to the
bars because they give me the
opportunity to get so tanked that I
throw up all over my shoes," he
explained. "They're also a good-
place to go if you're looking for a
good (date).on a Saturday night."

White said that Pitt's student
body is made up mostly of com-
muters, making it difficult to com-
pare the party atmosphere here
to that of other schools.

"I think most resident students
are getting along fine without the
commuters, though,” he said.

White said college would be
impossible without a social life
and that all Pitt students are
involved in at least one activity
outside the classroom. 0

“As in most colleges, you can't
survive at Pitt without becoming a
part. of the party scene here," he
said. ‘

One aspect of Pitt's social life
that White said’ he dislikes is the
attitude at same Pitt ii/'6r"ﬁér'i.

"They're either hanging all
over the football players or going
into the bars to be teasers," he
said. “It's all ego."

View ofRussia 

By RAY WUSLICH

The Reagan Administration
applies a “pressure cooker" theory
to the Soviet Union, viewing it as a
menace no matter what it does,
according to Pitt political science
professor Jonathan Harris.

Harris, speaking at the Univer-
sity Honors Prograin Student
Cabinet’s Noontime Lecture on
Wednesday, Oct. 20, said Reagan's
thinkers subscribe to “an incredi-
bly old—fashioned" conceptualiza-
tion of the impact of the Soviet
Union’s domestic priorities on its
foreign policy.

The Reagan Administration ,

argues that the Soviet Union is
faced with a range of domestic
problems, such as agriculture fail-
ures, dissidents and economic dis-
satisfaction, Harris said. The
administration also believes that as
internal situations deteriorate, the
U.S.S.R. will seek to rebuild its
domestic support through some
dramatic foriegn policy thrusts
outward, Harris said.

“This assumes that they
(U.S.S.R) simply heirs to the scarist.
legacy and is related to the percep-
tion that the Soviets need a war to
recover,” Harris said.

A more sophisticated view of the
Soviets would take into account the
complexity of its situation, accord-
ing to Harris. “Economic priori-

ties place limits on the flexibility of'

Soviet actions,” he said.
Inefficient agricultural practices

and a poor ( limate have forced the

U.S.S.R. dependent on other sour-

e ‘Old-Fashioned’

ces for its agricultural needs, to
adopt a more complex foreign pol-
icy. How it responds in terms of
foreign policy depends on the‘sev—
erity of the crisis at any particular
time, Harris noted.

He explained that the “theory of
totalitarianism" has been the most
widely held explanation of Soviet
development. The theory holds

_that the Soviets’ application of
massive political force and domes-
tic terrorism in transforming it's
domestic system is a blueprint for
global political change.

“It (t_he theory) is logically neat
and leaves blanks which can be
filled in as you go,” Harris
explained.

That view was dominant until
the ’60s, when Stalin’s death was
followed by a decrease of the use of
physical terror and a repudiation
of Stalinism, Harris said. This
trend, along with the massive
American reaction against Viet-
nam, resulted in a shift of sympa-
thies, which saw the US. as a
symbol of international terrorism,
Harris said.

_ According to Harris, the two
likely successors to Soviet premier
Leonid Brezhenev are Iurii

Andropov and Konstantin Cher-
enko. Though Cherenko is Brezh-

nev’s personal choice, he will

probably not be considered, Harris
said. Cherenko was a party official
during the l930s and survived the

Stalin purges, which, Harris said,

means he was either “lucky, a
genius or he turned in all his

frieiids.”

What it
  All Means

For the first time, the College Board has
released a breakdown of Scholastic Aptitude
Test (SAT) scores by racial and ethnic back-
grounds. The results may help clear up misun-
derstanding about what all those SAT statistics
really mean.

The board had reported that white-students
scored considerably higher than black students
on their tests; white students averaged 442 on
the verbal and 483 on the math, while black
students scored 332 on the verbal and 362 on the
math. The figures were for students who gradu-
ated from high school in 1981.

This fall’ freshman class, the board said,
lagged behind the national average of 426 on
the verbal, section by 85 points and were 101
points below the national average of 467 on the
math section. According to the board, white
students averaged 444 on the verbal and 483 in
math.

If you stop here and try to analyze the trend in
College Board scores, you’ll be way off the
mark.

That’s because the hard figures don’t repres-
ent what’s really going on in the world of SAT
scores. The College Board’s unexpected break-
down of SAT scores is revealing and reflects
more accurately the trends in the scores.

For example, the main reason for the rise in
the national average this year (two points in
verbal and one point in math from 1981 to 1982)
is the jump in the_scores of minority students.
Black students’ verbal scores went up nine
points, and their math scores increased by four.

A spokesman for the College Board told The
Chronicle For Higher Education, “When we
weighed minority contributions to the score
increases this year, it indicated that minorities
had played a significant role,” The spokesman also
noted that for the past six years, the difference
between the scores of minorities and whites has been

narrowing.

The rest of the report also indicated relation-
ships between a student’s score and factors such
as his parents level of education and family
income.

It’s not easy to understand why the Board had
been so hesitant in the past to release this back—
ground information. Certainly it’s worth
knowing, especially considering that each year,
a million high school seniors take the SAT. But

now that it’s been done, it lessens the chances of
the College Boards statistics being misperceived
and its results generalized.

Cocktail Party Taboos

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Media has several roles in our
society today. Naturally, it is a tool
for information and can also be
used as a public watchdog.
Another less known role is to get its
readers and viewers to think about
the world around them. To think
about their government, their cul-
ture, and their morals and to act, if
necessary.

Monday's column (“For What
It’s Worth”) was partly an attempt
by me to get Pitt students and the
university community as a whole
thinking about sexism.

The atmosphere in The Pitt
News office this past week has been
one of a comedy. At least 10 letters
have come in so far in reference to
my column. I'd be sitting at my
desk and the editor or our secretary
would yell, “another letter about
you, Chris.” By yesterday after-
noon, I had probably received more
letters than any other Pitt News
staff member.

The reaction to my column was
quite surprising. One wit, who was
too scared to sign his name, sug-
gested that I be gang banged by the
Pitt Panther football team and
then write a song about it. That
way, the letter said, I would know
what it was like to be treated badly

by a man. Real smart reasoning,
huh?

Okay, some facts were incorrect.
Pete Townsend sings “Athena".
not Roger Daltry and the line says
“she's a bomb” (another sexist
comment). Obviously my source
was misinformed; even Walter
Cronkite has those days. The title
of the Donnie Iris song was a mis—
print, through no fault of my own.

I The most surprising response,
however, was the responses. In
these pages, opinions about stu-
dent apathy, cuts in student aid and
the state of our economy have
appeared. I have authored some of
these opinions. The funny part is, I
never received a reply either sup-
porting or opposing my positions
on subjects that were important to
us all.

After I write a column on rock
and roll, letters come pouring in
insulting my abilities as a manag-
ing editor and my womanhood. I
now have to take a new position on
college students’ intelligence.

I thought only teenyboppers

, made rock music their lives because

of a lack of maturity. Obviously,
many people my age also make
rock music a, big part of their lives,
too. That’s really sad when you
think about it.

Does it Once Again

Dear Editor:

I think Christina Clinton, Pitt’s
foremost comedian, has done it
again. I praise her for her ability to
write an article on something she
claims “intelligent people know
enough to shrug...off.” Perhaps
she can teach us how to be intelli-
gent, especially now that she is old
enough not to take Top 40 as gos-
pel.

I sympathize with her fear of this
illness, sexism, which “is more
dangerous to our society" than
“Ronald Reagan.” Who needs
tunes like “Quit Your Bitchin', Get
Back in the Kitchen?” Not me, and
certainly not a women who judged
on her mouth size would “qualify
as being able to wear the pants" I
hope Roger Daltrey, Hall and

Oates, and Billy Joel will learn as
Mick Jagger did that “waiting on a
‘lady’ ” is a bad sexist attitude but
‘waiting on a friend’. is fine.

So I would request that we all
comply with the Christina Clinton
plea: “I see a serious problem that
must be dealt with because it is
infecting the youth of America.”
“This is one problem that should

I not be ignored or shrugged off,” as

we already learned, intelligent peo-
ple have. “Don’t let this degrada-
tion of women continue to infect
our country.” I am glad it was the
author “Conspiracy of Silence”,
Christina, and not me who called
for this mass censorship to protect
our rights.

This is evidentby the content of
the letters. Everyone wrote how ter-

“Athena” wrong, or how Mick
Jagger was »waiting for Keith
Richards (or was it someone else?).
What many of the letters failed to
recognize that maybe there is sex-
ism in rock music. Maybe this is a
bad thing happening in our
society. All these leters said was
that my knowledge of rock and roll
was poor, but didn’t compliment
my commitment to feminism.

wouldn’t want to. I like rock and

roll. But if I can, I will continue to

use these pages, as I may, to get the
Pitt community to think about

vital issues. Maybe next time,

they'll be able to see what the issues

really are.

Maybe we’ve all learned a valua-
ble lesson from this incident. There
are three things you don’t discuss at
cocktail parties or on the opinion
pager of The Pitt News: politics,
religion and rock and roll.

Poriies Defencled

Dear Editor:

This letter is in response to a
letter appearing in the Sept. 15
issue of The Pitt News protest-
ing dormitory parties.

One of the most popular
forms of socializing is to have a
party. A party is a form of
socializing and not a gathering
of alcoholics as implied. Furth-
ermore, the presence of alcohol
at a party and the fact that some
people are drinking it does not
make everyone there an alco-
holic. Also, alcohol does not
have to" be the contributing fac-
tor to an uncontrolled affair.
Therefore, the lack of alcohol
does not insure a quiet party.

In many cases a party will be
loud. But why should the carn-
pus police be called upon to
intervene when no physical or
structural damage has been
coinrnitted?

In conclusion, the ll1(ll\'l(Ill2lI
who feels he is being (Iepri\'e(l of

Dear Editor: ’

After reading Christina Clin-
ton’s editorial about rock and
roll, I think that perhaps she
should do a little research
before she forms. an opinion.
First of all, I have been listening
to rock music as long as I have
owned my very first transistor
AM radio. I can honestly say
that I have not, nor shall ever
be, influenced by rock's sexist
“knack,” if it even has one. Not

.too many high schoolers can
afford to, or are allowed to go
and iust cruise in their parent’s
car. And those that do don’t
listen to Top 40 radio stations
unless WDVE is a Top 40 sta-
tion. WDVE, at least, plays true

rock and roll. I consider stations
that play Top 40 as more of easy
listening. Rock and roll con-
sists of the following as well as
others: AC/DC, (Van Halen,
The Who, The Rolling Stones,
Ted Nugent and King Kool—
Donnie Iris.

I am not a fan of Billy Joel 8c
Hall and Oates, but I consider
them as “mellow” rock and roll
if they are rock and roll, but
don’t condemn all rock and roll
because of their few sexist
remarks, if they have any.

If teenagers take rock music
as gospel, then there should not
be as much drug and alcohol
abuse when there are songs by
Lynryd Skynyrd denouncing
whiskey, cocaine and quaa-
ludes such as “That Smell.”~
Ronnie Van Zant wrote these
songs, yet he still did concerts
with at least one fifth of whis-
key on stage. He may not have
practiced what he preached, but

Research Needed

he did make his point. If he had
not been killed four years ago
today, October 20, 1978, I would

bet he would still write songs-

against the stuff and he would
still do concerts with his fifth
on stage.

Now if you buy the album
“It’s Hard" by The Who, you
will find the lyrics for “Athena”
to go “...She’sjust a girl, she’s a

. bomb.” Roger Daltry did not

write or sing it either, but Pete
Townshend did. Pete is a tal-
ented musician and song writer
and that must be why he has
lasted so long. If he was a sexist,
would so many women attend
his concert with The Who?
Sure, sexism is still here. The
E.R.A. is dead and Reagan is
president. But don’t condemn
all radio stations for playing
garbage because Perry Marshall

/ and KDKA would not like it;

Myron Cope and WTAE would
not like it; and especially
WSSH would not like it because
they don’t even play music with
lyrics.

I suggest revenge. Perhaps
with all of the “all women”
rock groups today, such as The
Go-Go's, Joan Jett, Quarter-
flash and Heart, you may sug-
gest to them to use sexism and
sing about men as studs and
gigolos. More power to you
because 1 think that there will
always be sexism whether there
is music or not. This does not
mean that I am a sexist. I don’t
think I am, but is there any man
thattruly is not or has not been
sexist in one way or another?

Column Written With Crayon

Dear Editor,

I was dismayed to open my Pitt
News on Monday only to find
Christina Clinton was at it once
again. She has produced her acid-
tipped crayon to again rant and
rave on a subject which she knows
next to nothing about. Previously
it was fraternities; now it's rock
music.

First, Christina, believe it or not,
you _can’t become an expert on fra-
ternities until you’ve joined one.
Even joining doesn’t assure your
expertise. As a fraternity member, I
can attest to this fact. Obviously,
you cannot.

But more importantly, let's look
at your Monday editorial, “For
What It Is Worth.” I’m not going
to argue feminism or sexism with
you. I would prefer to point out
your ignorance of the rock music
that you so vigorously attack and
your numerous inaccuracies.

Point one: Donnie Iris has never
written a song. called “Quit Your
Bitchin', Get Back in the Kitchen.”
I believe you’re referring to “I
Can't Hear You,” an Iris song in
which a line similar to “Quit...Kit-
chen” appears.

Point two: In The Who’s song,
“Athena”, which you quote, the
line is “she’s a bomb," not “she's a
whore." Go put the album on your
Close ‘n’ Play and listen to it again.

Point three: On the same album
as “Waiting on a Friend” (which

you grossly misinterpreted)
appears a song called “Little T 8:
A." Big deal, right? The point is
that nobody seriously believes
Mick Jagger has changed his atti-
tude toward women.

Point four: You cite Roger Dal-
trey for his cruel abuse of women in
the lyrics of “Athena.” I’m sure

Pete Townshend is glad to be off
the hook, considering that he, not
Daltrey, authored the song.

Point five: Let’s leave the music

4 reviews to Rolling Stone, or Show-

case if you please. And Christina,
stick to subjects that you know

about. Big mouths, for example.

Pork Chops,

and Junior’s

Dear Editor:

Hey, Chrissy, what did we do
to piss you off this time, BABY?
So what if today’s music reflects
a supposedly “dangerous” sex-
ist attitude? If the shoe fits, wear
.lt—that is, if you can decide on
the'color.

I don’t know what you have
to complain about--in your
later life. All you’ll have to do is
make pork chops, dust the end
table and make sure ]unior’s
pants are pressed. Besides, the
only reason you are managing
editor is because no REAL man
would have it.

Concerning your recent edi-
torial: in typical womanly rant-
ing fashion, what may have
started out being a sound idea
completely fell apart in a series
of rash misquotes.

Chris, honey, let me serenade
you: “She’s just a girl; she’s a
bomb;" the title is “I Can't Hear

End Tables
Pants :

chin’,” which is something you
might consider doing on your
way back to the kitchen.

You feminists shouldn’t
push your luck. We men have
given you quite a bit of leeway
these past couple of years. Per-
haps we should pull the leash
back before the daughters of
America all request Tonka
trucks and want to strap on the
jocks with the guys. Does this
sound promising?

If this sounds asinine and rid-
iculous, it should-

The point I’m trying to make
is that we can’t take things so
seriously. Music is meant to be
entertainment and is there
solely for our enjoyment. Let’s
not get carried away.

After all, Ms. Clinton, all
work and no play make jack
and Diane dull people.

not taken seriously enough; some-

take it, period. So for all of us who
find ourselves in all of those places,
here's The Rock Yearbook 1983 to tell us
what really happened in the rock cir-
cles during this past year.

Back for its third straight year, The

section of quotes by rock's most
illustrious.

Rockers aren't known for their
brilliance, and quotes printed here
(taken from various magazine inter-
views during the past year) prove it:

"I get called out for having a bodyguard,
but sometimes it's necessary. I nearly had my
chest ripped off once...irnagine losing a tit to a

The one thing that might make
you mad about this book is that, like
its two predecessors, it's definitely
anti-America. Slurs are made on
nearly every page about American
music, American youth, American
radio and anything else that's

vaguely Yankee. Some of it's justi-‘

fied (radio over here does leave much
to be desired), but there's and unden-
iable slant that tends to lose credibil-
ity after awhile. I mean, how can you

like they're trying to convince us

But, aside from the snide com-

wonderful trip through rock's great-

Mystique: A complex of transcen-
dental or somewhat mythical beliefs
and attitudes developing around
something.

-—Webster

Heavy Metal as an art form
differs from the rest of the rock
and roll world. Not so much in
its symphonic combination of
raw power and artistic finesse,
lacking in other
types of music, but in its atti-
tude about what it means to be
an individual in an oppressive
universe. Heavy Metal is the
music of the intellect‘ (at least
headbangers might have had a
brain before HM), of those who
know how to deal with a hostile
environment.

The heavy metal attitude is
that while the world is a tough
place to live, those who can
clearly see things as they are
and enjoy themselves in the
process of banging their brains
to life on the floor, will rule the
world someday in spite of them-
selves. This Heavy Metal mys-
tique permeated the Civic
Arena Oct.13 when Judas Priest
and Iron Maiden put on a con-
cert. Each band put on a superb
show, both musically and visu-
ally, combining state-of-the-art
music and instrumental pro-
wess with the finesse and char-

acter inherent in Heavy Metal.

Iron Maiden started the night
with ”Murders in the Rue
Morgue” and ”Wrathchild,” two
songs from their flawless Killers
album. The crowd could feel in
it's bones how much the group
put into their music and the
powerful attitude from whence
it came. Bruce Dickinson, Iron
Maiden’s new vocalist, put on
an impressive display of show-
manship, channeling the hope-
lessly psyched mob attitude
prevalent that night into a sus-
tained frenzy that lasted
throughout the show. He was
backed by the impressive guitar
onslaught of Dave Murray and
Adrian Smith and the excellent
play of Steve Harris, one of
rock's premier bassists. Clive
Burr, a very heavy drummer,
rounded out the attack, provid-
ing the driving rhythm that has
become Iron Maiden’s trade-
mark. J

Batting off in quick succes-
sion and with excellent form
were ”Run for the Hills," ”The
Number of the Beast," ”22 Aca-
cia Avenue,” ”Hallowed Be Thy
Name ” and the title track from
their American debut, Iron
Maiden during which Eddie,
who, for the uninitiated, is the
group's 15 foot tall ghoul mas-
cot, made an appearance. The
crowd went wild as the tower-
ing beast, who resembles James
Dean with Boris Karloff’s head,
chased the group's guitarists
about the stage. Iron Maiden
then left the stage and returned
to play "Drifter,” from Killers, as

an encore.

After an overly long Civic
Arena-style wait, the lights
dimmed and Judas Priest opened
with ”Electric Eye,” minus lead

’ singer Robert Halford who, at

the beginning, was heard but
not seen. The entire crowd
looked frantically for Halford,
who finally was revealed by a
spotlight as he leaned in theatri-

cal contempt against a speaker.

.38 SPECIAL/SPYS
Stanley Theatre
October 12, 1982

J By GEORGE HOLZER

The crowd was very biased,
you could feel it in the air. These
people wanted .38’Special, and
nothing else would do. Pity poor
Spys.

Spys, a fairly new band from
the Big Apple, came out and did
a very strong set. They played
much of their debut album;
”She Can't Wait," ”Ice Age,”
”Into Night," and ”Don’t Run
My Life,” were among the best
of recorded material. ”Sheep
Don't Talk Back,” an unreleased
track, was also very inspired.
The trouble was this great set
by a very talented band fell on
deaf ears. When Spys left, very
few even tried to get them to
return for an encore. That's
Pittsburgh for you.

When the lights dropped
again, the silence for Spys was
explained. Everybody saved
his voice for .38 Special. There
were more roars than screams.
”Take 'em Out" is what the
group opened with, much to the
audience's approval. Donny
Van Zant looked very impish as

he ran around the stage

‘kittit‘kit***'k**'k*i'****k*'ki***k**'k*'k****'k*****'k***'k'k'k*'k*'k*‘l

went through much of their
Special Forces album with a few
older hits thrown in to keep the
crowd moving. ”Wild Eyed
Southern Boys," "Chain
Lightnin'," ”Caught Up In You,”
and ”Hold On Loosely" were the
big crowd pleasers. After
thirteen songs, they left the
stage.

The people stomped, clapped,
and screamed for more than
four minutes before \ .38
returned to the stage. The two
song encore started with the
band's first hit, ”Ro_ckin' Into
The Night." Van Zant pranced
around the stage throwing cans
of brew into the crowd and held
his microphone out so everyone
could sing. The second encore
was a cover of”It Ain't Me." The
song was" performed well, and
the crowd loved it. The only
hitch that that was all there
was, no more encore, no more
anything. .

There was plenty of goo
hard rock in the Stanley, but I
feel sorry for people who missed
the first set because they were
too stupid to listen. Spys did an
admirable job. Thanks to both
bands for a great night of rock
and roll.

Halford made for an interesting
show as he strutted above the
stage, making point after point
about life within the framework
of his music. ”Electric Eye” went
right into ”Riding on the Wind,"
as it does on the album Screaming
for Vengeance. The Priest then
played a hit from their Point of
Entry, ”Heading Out for the
Highway,” followed by ”Metal
Gods,” from British Steel. One
could hear the iron beat of tech-

, nocracy in the guitar of K.I(.

Downing and Glen Tipton,
backed by Ian Hill on bass and

. Dave Holland on’ drums. The

group continued their excellent
show with ”Bloodstone,"
”Breaking the Law,” ”Desert
Plains," ”Grinder," "The
Ripper,” and--an odd choice——
the Joan Baez folk classic, "Dia-
monds and Rust." The Priest
then played their hits ”You’ve
Got Another Thing Coming"
and ”Victim of Changes,” after

.which they left the stage, the

lighters came out, butane was
burned by the ton and the Priest
returned to play their Heavy
Metal anthem ”Living After
Midnight.” What really made
Judas Priest's show so good was
that they understand and por-
tray the fantasy element neces-
sary for Heavy Metal. The
crowd at a concert like this one
wants to see a group of larger-
than-life advocates of the way it
sees the world, and that's
exactly what it got from both
groups. Where else do 15 foot
tall ghouls shake their fists at
the heavens, and where else can
one see Rob Halford, clad in his
leather law enforcement outfit,
standing high above a crowd of

DONNIE IRIS/B.E. TAYLOR
PITT HOMECOMING
OCT. 15, 1982

THE CLASH/THE CORE
CMU Homecoming
Oct. 16, 1982
By TODD ERKEL
‘ I'll always remember Home-
coming '82 as the Saturday
night I stood out on Forbes
Avenue, somewhere between
Pitt and CMU, wondering
aloud, "What the hell had gone
wrong with live rock-n—roll?"
In a period of about 24 hours,

The Clash and Donnie Iris had.

delivered two very different yet

equally uninspired versions of a
rock concert, and few, if any, of
the 4,000 folks who handed
over their inflated dollars
seemed to notice. V

Mind you, I am not a prude.
Two consenting parties——one
paying for some excitement in
their otherwise dull lives, the
other performing a service by
going through the motions——
may spend their time and
money as they please; just keep
rock-n—roll out of it.

How can rock-n—roll be pre-
tentious? Let me count the
ways. In the case of the Donnie
Iris/B.E. Taylor concert, it came
in the form of all the pomp and
panache the PPC could muster.
From the guest appearance by
Pitt's own marching blue to the
sea of red T—shirted sentries
down front, the atmosphere
reeked of pageantry.

Call me subversive or apa-—
thetic or whatever you wish,
but when I pay to see a rock
concert, I don't go for the witty
remarks about local sports
teams; they make me cringe. So,
if you thought you saw some
mutated prune stumbling out of
David Lawrence Friday, that
was me, the result of no less
than five or six references by
Iris to Pitt football and its cer-
tain prowess over Temple,

Donnie Iris

Anyway, Donnie Iris came
on, real late—like, after an open~
ing set by a Weirton W.Va.
shopping mall band called B.E.
Taylor & Intermission—who
sounded like they belonged in
Weirton shopping malls.

Unlike the power—pop vitality
he presses onto vinyl, Donnie
Iris, presence and voice onstage,
is utterly frail. Iris’ backup band,
The Cruisers, were called upon
to sustain nearly every vocal
and the result was an indistinct
flatness.

Donnie’s onstage "antics"
came off like a Vegas lounge act,
not those of a rock star. The
highlight of Iris’ persona

A occurred during an introduction
to ''I Can't Hear You—No
More" that basically said, "it be
cool to get drunk and call your
wife a bitch.” Real profound,
Donnie!

The Cruisers didn't do any—
thing worth noting, musically,

but then again, the whole
power—pop sound that Iris lives
by depends on the blend of
every sound attainable into one

usic’s Not the Thine

ﬁtiiiiitﬁiiitiiiiititi**‘k‘k'k***'k***'k*i‘k'A"k'k'k***'k'k*'k***k****i*****i'*i"k**i't**'k'k****i'***'ki'*********i'i*i'

chord‘, then another, then
another. Bassist Al McClain did,
however, made a valiant
attempt at upstaging Iris by par-
ading about stage and mugging
to all the faithful.

So what? you ask. Everyone
seemed to have a good time, and
it was -a valid excuse to get
drunk and watch Donnie put on
the Pitt shirt and the Pitt band
get into the act and...and...and...
Well kids, if that's all we're
after, then why not have a Tiger
Paul/Myron Cope double bill
next year——I bet they tell a much
better story than, "hey my wife
told me to take out the
garbage—the bitch," etc., etc.

The throngs in attendance at
Saturday night's Clash gig at
CMU certainly witnessed the
better half of Oakland's Home-
coming concerts, but that
doesn't excuse the lack of dis-
cretion intheir appreciation. If
we don't become a little more
demanding, rock-n—roll might

as well be given intravenously.

Live Clash has developed a
reputation as being garage-like,
and this night was no exception.
The energy was relentless, but
the elements were difficult to
discern. Spread the blame
around to the band for not
doing a sound check and the
excessive decibels for further
distorting The Clash's already
sloppy sound.

The Clash seemed to have
grown no more accustomed to
drummer Terry Chimes than
they did during the tour’s initial
phase. When Mick Jones would
take the front, comrade
Strummer lingered around the
drum kit suggesting that even
he couldn't figure out what was
wrong here. V

Strummer remained his
maniacal self, shrieking out his
vocals with a firm grip on his
temples as if he were driven by
some greater force. Just what it
is that drives Strummer and his
band of urban refugees remains
a secret. I'd like to think that it's
their music, but when they con-
sistently mangle the presenta-
tion, you begin to look
elsewhere. The posing, leaping

o

and running about is pure photo
session, as is Strummer's stead-
fast glare. We all know this band
is angry, but we also know that,
unlike the Sex Pistols, they'll
never piss themselves off into
self—destruction.

Judging from the reception
given The Clash's hits (songs
like "Train In Vain," ”Rock The
Casbah " and "Should I Stay or
Should I Go"), I'd say that most
of the crowd wasn't real hard-
core. N6, this was Halloween

i come early to CMU as everyone

put on the worst dressed,
pseudo-punk attire they could
find and played poor for the
night.

The Clash didn't allow any
time in between songs for diges-
tion, so picking out highlights is
futile, In general, I'd take the
four or five numbers that Jones
sang as the best. Although far
from spectacular, his voice
shines when you hear it next to
Strummer's. Strummer at his
best would be ”The Magnificent
Seven."

The Clash were raw and
relentless and sloppy and proba-
bly everything else I expected.
The Clash live are everything
they manage to capture in the
studio, and for that reason, they
were worth the scalper’s rate of
$10.

Nevertheless, there still
exists some middle ground
between the approaches of Iris
and The Clash. I see no need for
compromising one’s stance in an
effort to entertain the paying
public. I see no chance of that
happening until the paying pub-
lic raises their standards.

”They’ve grown up with a lot,
and they're bored. I feel like ifI
ever have kids, I'm going to walk
into their room on their 15th
birthday and say, 'all right, off
it!’ and I'd throw them out of the

,house...none of this inheriting

your daddy's wealth creating
monsters and killing people
off," said Joe Strummer in a
recent summation of American‘
youth. The irony that "daddy's .
wealth" probably filled the gym
at CMU is inescapable. The
Clash's ideology fails again.

Music From The '40 s

THE BOSWELL SISTERS
The Boswell Sisters
CBS Records

Who? The Boswells—
Connee, Martha, and Helvet-
ia—three sisters from New
Orleans who ’ revolutionized
three-part close vocal harmony
in the early 1930s.

Have you heard of the
Andrews Sisters? They sang
”Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" and
a lot of other things during the
19405. Patti Andrews said
recently, "Connee, Vet and
Martha Boswell were our idols,
and we tried to sing like them.
More than 40 years later, I-still
think they were the greatest." I

The Boswell Sisters came up
through local talent shows and
vaudeville, and in 1931, William
Paley hired them for his new
network, CBS, and gave them a
radio show. Their jazz-vocal
style was immediately popular
and copied.

CBS has released a three-
record set of the Boswell Sis-
ters'_ original recordings—3O
selections from 1931-1933, and
it's an exciting package. These
girls can sing. Martha gets the
low notes; Helvetia has the high
ones; and Connee fits the lead
into the middle, resulting in a
tight, equivalent blen/d over
which they have complete con-
trol. Their diction is impeccable,
and they use the voice not as an
accompaniment, but as
instrument with the band.

an

 

the songs herself, and quite lib-
erally, so that the sisters aren't
unduly hampered by structure
or convention. Different styles
are incorporated—swing, blues,
pop and even spiritual. The
tempos are changed frequently
within the songs, creating
wonderfully varied textures.
And besides singing, they hum
and scat-sing in three-part and
even imitate band instruments,
vocalizing-a trumpet or trom-
bone part here and there. It's
unpretentious, and you can
hear the fun they're having
with it. The Boswells are accom-
panied by such notable "studio"

»musicians as Tommy Dorsey on

trombone, Jimmy Dorsey on
clarinet, and frequently, Mar-
tha Boswell on the piano.
There's not a lousy cut in the
set-quite an achievement-
and some of them are outstand-
ing. "Mood Indigo," the Duke
Ellington number, is a smoky,
torchy outing with an excellent
blues feeling. An atmospheric
"Forty-Second Street,” shifted
into a minor key, is blocks ahead
of Ruby Keeler's version in the
film. ”There'll Be Some
Changes Made" gets a classic
treatment—-a full—speed chorus
drops into traditional 12-bar
blues for Connee and then
shifts abruptly into another
banging chorus. "Sleep, Come
On and Take Me,” a previously
unreleased song, boasts an
excellent swinging accompani-
ment from the Dorseys, Mar-

All right, they're not modern.
The recordings are monaural,
even. But listen to that blend-—
smoother than milkshake. The
Boswell Sisters are not well
known, but their pioneer
approach to popular-jazz vocals
has had lasting influence. Their
skill and talent are admirably
demonstrated in the perfor-
mances in this album.

THE COMPLETE TOMMY
DORSEY

VOLUME VII/1938-39
Tommy Dorsey

RCA-Bluebird

In the 19305 and 1940s, RCA
had some of the most popular
big bands of the era under con-
tract. A few years ago, the com-
pany began reissuing, in
chronologicallorder, the com-
plete recordings of some of
these artists. Trombone player
Tommy Dorsey, "who started
recording for RCA in 1935, is
one of their works—in—progress.

Like its seven predecessors,
The Complete Tommy Dorsey Volume
VIII is an expertly and attrc-
tively packaged two-record set.
This one consists of 33 songs
recorded over a five-month
period. .Most of the numbers
have been unavailable since
their original release, and for
the first time, the swing enthu-
siast has access to Dorsey's
lesser-known material as well as
his hits. Complete recording
and personal information and
photos are included, along with
meticulous, self-indulgent liner
notes by Mort Coode.

Dorsey's 16-member band
achieves an excellent, relaxed
ensemble sound: structured
naturally around his trombone

playing. He has somestandout.

sidemen, with Yank Lawson on

I'D ..yr..-

L THE BOSWELL SISTERS 
trumpet, Babe Russin on tenor
sax and Maurice Purtill and
Dave Tough on drums.. The
band is equally adept at swing
and’ the slower "sweet" music.

Vocal duties are split between

Jack Leonard and Edythe
Wright. Leonard has a pleasant
but not particularly memorable
voice that is well suited to bal-
lads. Miss Wright's is bubbly,
low and delicious, and her deliv-
ery is effortless on fast or slow
numbers.

Love songs of varying lyric
intensity dominate Volume VIII.
Theyiare generally treated the
same, musically-—compe_tently
arranged and played midtempo,
suitable for dancing. Standout is
"Heaven Can Wait," Leonard's
best effort. “Sweet Sue—]ust
You" and "Blue Moon" demon-_
strate a popular Dorsey gim-
mick: a men's chorus

, underscoring Leonard's vocal
with tongue-in-cheek musical
commentary.

The instrumentals are varied.
There are some good blues-—
”Tin Roof" and "Davenport,"
with proper low-down feel. .
”Down Home Rag" is uninhi-
bited Dixieland. Dorsey's five-
.minute ”Milenburg Joys,"
swinging and certainly joyous,
is the best of the set.

It doesn't all work. "Hold
Tight" is anunfortunate cover
of the Andrews Sisters’ hit. And
many of the ballads are undis-
tinguished because of similiar
presentation.

Most of it is great stuff; there
is plenty of Dorsey's distinctive
trombone work. CompIeIe...Vo-
Iume VIII presents a brief period
in the evolution of the Tommy
Dorsey orchestra. The album
provides a good cross—section of
his work, but it's geared to the
serious collector rather than the
casual swing fan.

ABOMINOG
Uriah Heep
Mercury

Heavy Metal lives on! Uriah
Heep has finally given me a
good reason to crank my stereo
up to ”deafening” and forget
everything. Good thing they
didn't write themselves off
when everyone else did.

This isn't the Heep you grew

have recruited three very good

‘musicians to augment the

band—-Peter Goalby (vocals),

cals), and Bob Daisley (bass/vo-
cals). Daisley is the only familiar
name; he has worked for Rain-
bow and with Kerslake for
Ozzy.

/lhominog, besides having an
interesting cover, contains 1.0
tunes that beat at your ear-
drums with a ferocity that is
lacking in many heavy metal
bands. All of the songs are good,
but I like ”On The Rebound,"
”Running All Night," and ”Sell
Your Soul” best. I V _

Uriah Heep and heavy metal

GEORGE HOLZER
SENSE AND SENSUALITY

Au Pairs
Roadrunner Records

The Woods’ philOS0phy—-
relevant examples of sex roles,
society's expectations and how
they conflict with self interest—-
is brought up to date with the
release of the Au Pairs’ second
album, Sense and Sensuality. As
English independent favorites,
the Au Pairs take full advantage
of the creative freedom a major
record contract often forbids,
giving us as much energy and
statement on this album as they
did on their debut, Playing Withta
Different Sex. _

To get her points across, Les-
ley Woods uses the distinctive
Au Pairs’ sound: powerfully del-
ivered vocals balanced by over-
lapped, cutting guitar riffs and a
steady yet inflective bass line.
The addition of horns, saxo-
phone and synthesizer provides
mood and punctuation yielding
a matured sound, first reassur-
ing, then captivating. This is
best evidenced by ”Steppin out
of Line,” a moody track, overtly
representative of Woods’ out-
standing vocal ability.

The Au Pairs are both lyri-
cally and musically entertain-
ing. For example, ”lntact,”
reminiscent of the first album in
its funkiness, proves Woods’

willingness to express her sex-

ual opinions and observations.
Sense and Sensuality does some-
thing the debut did not: itoffers
an alternative. ”Se‘x Without
Stress” asks ”Would you like to
express your sex without
stress...7” implying that role
playing evokes an inflammatory
response in our sexual rel_ation-
ships. If you let honesty and
awareness separate sex from
love and expectations, you get
”That’s When It's Worth It,”
another alternative melodically

Playing With a Different Sex
reported on society's many

dilemmas. Sense and Sensuality-

with its alternatives doesn't
attempt to make things any
more comfortable by talking
around the subject; it gets to the
point. The Woods’philosophy:
Why the big deal? If you wanna
fuck, then fuck.

JOHN TOMAYKO
 
HOLLY AND THE ITALIANS
Holly Beth Vincent
CBS

”Frankie,” my mother would
say as she pinched my cheek in
the kitchen, ”to make good
pasta fagioli the way your papa
likes, you must always
remember to use just one can of
puree and lots of Parmesan
cheese so that the sauce is real
thick and spicy.” Ah mama,
every time I listen to Holly Beth
Vincent's new album, I reach for
that familiar spot on my cheek
and wonder why that little
bacala girl never got to hear
your advice.

After releasing her first
album, The Right To Be Italian,
which was a much gutsier,
though no less irresistible an
answer to the Go-Go's We Got
The Beat, Holly Beth Vincent has
ruined her sauce. In probably
what is an answer to the critics’
cries that her live shows were
mindlessly heavy metal, Vin-
cent has taken the other
extreme and fired her backing
band, The Italians (Lord knows
why she titled the album Holly
and the Italians), along with dilut-
ing her once brash sound to
mere water-like properties.
There's no Parmesan and too
much puree in this one.

Gone is the two-chord magic
of ”I Wanna Go Home” and
”Tell That Girl To Shut Up”
that highlighted Vincent's
”Naples via the Bronx” voice.
Although her vocals are still
strong on Holly Am! The Italians,
nothing much else on the album
cuts the cappicola. The songs
are weak, and the music is even
weaker. Somewhere along the
line, a string section finds its

way onto the soundtrack and
clashes so terribly with Vin-
cent's tough girl lyrics and
music, that the effect is one of
instant nausea—sort of like eat-
ing tripe. The overall result of
Holly and the Italians is about as
likeable as a Neapolitan in Sicily.

So take it from the man with
the cement bag in the trunk of
his car, if you really want to
listen to Holly Beth Vincent,
buy her first album. And oh
yeah, Holly, I want you to talk to
my mother...

BURNING ROME
Burning Rome

A&M

Perhaps this album can best
be described as a work of art—if,
that is, that work of art is one
which defines the most generic
aspects of rock and roll. Burning
Rome is, in a word, inoffensive.

Nothing new here, nothing’

exciting, nothing extremely
horrible; it's an absolute void, an

orgy of mediocrity.

Burning Rome has a female
lead singer, which probably
accounts for their being signed
to a contract in the first place,
seeing how everyone’s trying to
cash in on the Go—Go’s/Pat
Benatar/Quarterflash craze.
The story, according to the pub-
licity department, is that a big-
wig at A&M was ”so impressed”
by vocalist Vicki Thomas that
he ”pronounced her as one of
the three women born to sing
rock and roll, along with Janis
Joplin and Bonnie Bramlett.”
Weeelll...I dunno about that;
she's not bad, but she's not that
good, either. My guess is that
the big-wig had been listening
to Joan Jett tapes for about an
hour before he made his pro-
found proclamation.

I’m not even gonna go into
semi-detail about this; put it this

way: if Giant Eagle's generic‘

cans of vegetables dilate your
pupils and make your palms
sweat, you'll love Burning
Rome.

Hold Me,"

A Satirical
Look At

American Life

By LEONA PETKAVICH

The 1982. University of Pittsburgh
Studio Theatre season begins this
week with the opening of Hold Me!, a
comedy by Jules Feiffer. Hold Me! will
be performed Thursday through
Sunday this week (October 21-24),
and Thursday through Saturday next
week (October 28-30).

Hold Me! is based on Jules Feiffer's
bitingly satirical Village Voice car-
toons and offers Feiffer's unique
perceptions of life and love in Amer-
ica. The scenes range from the wildly
funny to the painfully true and make
all stops in between.

The production is under the direc-

tion of Christopher Applegate, for-
merly the artistic irector of the
Philadelphia Repertory Company
and Second Sight Theatre Lab. "The
cartoon origins of a script like this can
be a problem," comments Applegate.

"Actors aren't cartoons and can't
play cartoons. They've got to play
flesh and blood people. But in work-
ing on Hold Me!, the cast and I have
found that there is a real sense of
truth and reality in Feiffer’s work -

A sense of truth is very evident in
the work of Hold Mel's energetic
young cast—Cece Donoghue, Wil-
liam B. Cooley, ]r., Dan Wyse, Bar-
bara Ann Mischler, De Bora Smith
and Eileen Kramer. "You could play a
lot of this material for cheap laughs,"
says’ Wyse. "But if it's real for you-
and I've had a lot of the experiences
the characters I play have had——then
it turns out even funnier for the
audience than if you'd hammed it up.
Some of this stuff is actually pretty
painful."

While no effort has been made to
copy the visual aspects of Feiffer's
cartoons, Feiffer fans will neverthe-
less be sure to recognize some of his

classic characters. There are, for
example, Marcia, the cynical dancer
(Cece Donoghue), and Bernard Mer-
gendeiler, the kind, sweet, and ulti-
mately, ineffectual intellectual (Wil-
liam B. Cooley, Jr.)

The set, by University of Pitts-
burgh Theatre Arts Department res-
ident designer Henry Heymann, does

the look of comtemporary cartoon
art. Lighting is by Pitt technical direc-
tor David lager-Walker; costumes are

Spikers In Big East Showdown

I By MARK A. SINDLER

Lady Panther volleyball coach
Shelton Collier is guiding his team
into its stretch drive and is steering
along the winding and twisting
course with surprising efficiency.

Currently, he is coaching a 29-4
team that ventures to Villanova
Sunday for a Big East showdown.

Pitt faces Seton »Hall, George-
town and the Wildcats. The event
was not originally scheduled, {but
to insure a national bid in the
NCAA"s, the conference had to
schedule divisional competition.

These teams are in the southern
grouping and Providence, Boston

" » College, Syracuse and Connecticut

are in the northern division.

For the Panthers, the weekend
proceedings will determine seed-
ings in the division and will be a
big factor in governing who makes
it to the NCAAs—The Big East
_champion goes.

It is with this in mind that Col-
lier intends to -go into every match
this weekend. “We’ve played
superbly so far this season. We have
won, but did not play as well as we
needed to.

“This weekend, we will have to
institute a recommittment to

excellence.” ,
The third-year court boss inain-
tains that his team's statistics

reflect both intensity and enthusi-
asm, which are directly correlated,
he said. “I expect outstanding per-
formances statistically and

. emotionally.”

The Villanova Invitational will
be Collier’s “liome-stretch drive for
the NCAAS.” Up until last week,
the team played one match at a‘
time. “Now the emphasis must be
on establishing the level of play
that is good enough for the level of
play in the playoffs,” he noted.
“That means a good atmosphere
emotionally and the execution of

Shutout by Geneva

By JIM COLLINS

()nce again, the Pitt Panther
soccer team came up short, losing
to Geneva 1-0. It was an even coii-
test throughout, aiid Pitt had
numerous chances, but just
couldn’t put the ball in the net.

Geneva's Ivan Abbott scored the
only goal of the game, midway
through the first half. Abbott took
a direct kick from 25 yards out. He
curved the ball around the wall of
Pitt defenders, and goalie Dave
Torreiice could not stop the shot.

Pitt then applied more pressure,
but the Geneva defense remained
tough. Panther coach I.eo Bemis

Beinis. “Once we settled down, we

Instead, we have to scoré 15-4 and ‘

~ iThe Lady Panthers are in a state
similar to last season's, and five
players on this year’s squad tra-
veled to nationals last year.

“This team,” Collier said,
“knows very well how to prepare
for the Big Easts. For the NCAAs, it
is a different story. We may know
only two days before the match
who our opponent will be.” _

That will not be the case against
Pitt's three opponents. Seton Hall

H

HOW.

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Pitt’s path to a major bowl bid

and a national championship tra- I

ces northward tomorrow, when the
No. 2 ranked Panthers visit the Syr-

. acuse Orangemen.

After defeating four Top Twenty
teams in consecutive weeks and a
gritty Temple Owl team last week,
Syracuse will be a breather. The
game appears at mismatch com-
parable to, say, a heavyweight
boxer against a featherweight. The
word blowout has already been
‘carved into the Carrier Dome roof.

Blowout. Pitt is 5-0, and
Syracuse, I-5. Pitt has defeated
North Carolina, Florida State, Illi-
nois, West Virginia and Temple.
Syracuse has beaten Rutgers. ,

Blowout. The Panther defense
has allowed an average of less than
12 points a game. Other than Syra-
cuse’s 31-8 victory over Rutgers, the
Orangemen have averaged less
than 10 points a game.

Blowout. Pitt defeated Illinois
20-3. Illinois stomped Syracuse 47-‘
10. Pitt rolled over Temple 38-L7.
Syracuse lost to the Owls 23-18.

Blowout. At quarterback, it’s
Dan Marino, a big play specialist,
against Todd Norley, who is as
green as an out-of-season tomato.
Marino has shown he can find his
receivers—Dwight Collins and

-Julius Dawkins,Norley has not yet

proven he can connect with his

receivers—Mike Morris and Nick—

Bruckner. 
Blowout? Panther coach Foge
Fazio sees the game in a different

light. He knows that no fewer than

four starters—tight end John
Brown, linebacker Rich Kraynak
fullback Marlon Mclntyre and def-
ensive end Michael Woods—will
see limitedaction, if any time at all.

“It worries me,” Fazio said of the ~

injuries that have turned Pitt's
training room into something
resembling a hospital ward. “It’s
the most injuries I've seenat Pitt in
the last six years to starters and
important backup people.”
Injuries aside, Pitt will make an
appearance in Syracuse. The
names may be changed, but cer-
tainly not to protect the Orange-
men. Behind the injured starters
are capable backups. This was
clearly visible in last week’s game.
Clint Wilson replaced Brown,
and, as Fazio said after the game,

“Clint did an excellent job at both

blocking and pass catching.”

Michael Brooks, who replaced
Woods, led the team in tackles,
showing no signs of being a
backup. In replacing McIntyre,
Bill Beach and Joe McCall have
rambled over opponents.

“I’ve been very impressed with
Beach,” said Fazio. “And McCall
has got to get into the game more.
He’s doing a great job.”

So Pitt heads northward with a
no-name lineup, whilé‘ the
Orangemen await with an out-
manned team. The pressure, it
seems, has been lessened a few
points—despite the injuries. Even

azio can agree to that.

“With five good wins, we’ve
taken a big load off our shoulders,”
he said. “We're not out to impress
anybody. Wejust want to play foot-
ball like we can.”

Last year, while in Division II,
Seton Hall won the New Jersey
state conference. Lucy Ticki is in
her second year as coach, and the
team did not play a really strong
schedule this year. 

The partial-scholarship is in i
first year in the Big East and,
according to Dilley, it will take two
or three years to change over to Div-
ision I. V

“With that,” she noted, “the
school is looking to put more
money into the sport. The new

competition will mean more
travelling.

Bob Covell's Wildcats have been
“spotty and up and down” enroute
to an even 13-I3 mark. This tally is
probably due to the mid-Divisiori I
and top-Division I teams they have
faced.

“It's going a lot better,”‘Dr. Joe
McClure said of his 19-I0 Hoyas,
who were “fighting a losing spell
several weeks ago.

By TIM DINGER

“I wasn't very happy withgthe
results, it was a very frustrating
match," said Lady Panther tennis
coach -"George Dieffenbach after
Wednesday's 5-4 loss to Bucknell.

The match was decided in the
final doubles event, at which time
the score was tied 4-4.

Pitt’s Linda Stadler and Jody
Mattioli faced Amy Stifel and
Wendy Johnson in the match-
deciding contest. ‘

The match went the full three
sets, with Bucknell winning an 8-6
tie breaker in the third set to defeat
Pitt 4-6, 6-3, 7-6.

“We had match point,”
explained Dieffenbach,_ “but we
couldn’t pull it out. We justiwere
not strong enough in doubles.”

Even though the Lady Panthers
ended their regular season with an

8-2 record, Dieffeiibach expressed
disappointment at the final loss.
“It was a long trip and a cold
match,” he said. “The team fought
hard, but Biicknell had a stronger
team. It was an important match

for us to win before the Big East.".

In singles, Pitt senior Cathy Jac-
obson closed her regular season at
8-2 by smashing Bucknell’s Mary
Synekwash 6-0, 6-2, while at
number two singles, Lady Panth-
ers Lisa Lafuria boosted her record
to 8-2 by topping Amy Appel, 7-6,
6-1.

At number three singles, Buck-
nell’s Sylvia Gross defeated Pitt’s
Miriam Goltz  2-6, 6-2 and Val-
erie Adelson won over Pitt’s Linda
Stadler 6-3, 0-6, 6-4 in the fourth
singles match. Goltz finished the
regular season with a 5-5 record
and Stadler steps out at 8-2.

Pitt’s number five player——
freshman Kristine Peckman—
dropped Lisa Smails 6-'/, 4-6, 6-1 to
close at 8-2 on the season, and at

Williams Returns

Home to Syracuse

By IRA M. KATZ7

It will be a homecoming of sorts
for Panthers split end Keith Wil-
liams as the Panthers meet the Syr-

acuse Orangemen tomorrow at the.

Carrier Dome in New York.

Williams grew up on the out-
skirts of the recently constructed
Carrier Dome. He earned five let-
tcrs in football and basketball at
Nottingham High School in Syra-
cuse. He was named to the All-
Lcaguc and All-Upstate New York
teams his junior and senior years.

Does Williams get satisfaction in
returning to Syracuse and playing
football?

“I have the satisfaction of my
family being there and the game is
right in my backyard,” Williams
said. “I can try to relate that to the
team and help motivate them so we
can play a good game in Syracuse.”

Over the years, Syracuse has sent
many quality football players to
the National Football League.
Such notables as Larry Csonka and
Floyd Little played college football
there. In fact, the Pittsburgh Steel-

ers employ three former
()rangcmcn——-Craig Bingham,
Gary Anderson and Craig Wolfev.

Williams, who was once a big
fan of Syracuse, said, “They have

never won the big game.'Thcy havcg 

come close to beating a Pitt or a
Penn State, but they have never
really gotten over the hump and
won the big game that can give all
the players a confidence boost and
some morale."

Williams said of the upcoming
game, “We can’t go up there and
give them a chance to get that
incentive.”

Williams said that Syracuse's
failure to win the big game has pre-
vented them from recruiting the
upper echelon high school
players."

“I really do think,” he said, “that
if you have a very disappointing
season but beat a top contender, the
athletes will see that and loan a lit-
tle more toward staying home.

In 1977, former Panther coach
Jackie Shcrrill recruited Williams.

“Really, it was Coach Shcrrill’s
viewpoint that if you want to be
successful in Pittsburgh, you
might have to ovcrcoinc advcrsity,
but you will get the opportunity to
cxposc yourself, play and be with a
big time program,” Williams said.

At Pitt, Williams has bcn pri-
marily uscd as a backup split end.
He has found other ways; to con-
tribute, though, performing well
on speciality teams and being a
leader on the field.

“I’vc been here fivc ycars, 2lI1(l,~i._-._iw

thcrc is just something a little dif-
ferent about this team. I feel like
this is the best team I’vc been on at
Pitt," Williams said.

“It makes all the hard wor'k'scét‘n
very worthwhile,” he continued.
“You can be on a team like ours
and say you are 5-0 and still trying

-to go up."

The offensive unit appcars to
have come together, for as Willams
said, “We arc definitely starting to
gel. At times, we wcrc playing a
littlc sporadically. Maybe onc day
the linc wasn’t playing wcll, then
other days it was the rcccivcrs. Now

most highly regardetl individual
perforiiiaiices in the nation.

“_Excluding the Pac-10 confer-
ence, I don’t think you'll find a
tougher conference for cross-
country than the Big East,” said
Pitt coach john Vasvary of the
quality of Pitt's new conference.

Glancing at the competition,
Providence appears to have a defi-
nite advantage. When asked to
evaluate Providence, Vasvary said,
“They are a superior team. They
possess an oiitstanding cross-
country program with a strong
overseas contingency.

“Tliey are defiiiilely the team to
beat and appear ready to challenge
for the national cham'pionsliip.”

Challenging for second place,
most likely, could be any of the
following four teams: Villanova,
Georgetown, Syracuse and Boston
College.

Villanova and Georgetown have
traditionally been tough in cross-
country. By all indications, both
will continue to uphold past

V history.

Syracuse and Boston College
return outstanding individuals.
Syracuse brings a host of capable
competitors. Boston College
returns a national qualifier from
last year’s team and appears to have
quite a strong group behind him.

Two good teams, who probably
will not defeat anyone significant,
are St. _]ohn’s and (Zonnecticut.
Both are well-balanced, but do not
have the outstanding iiidividtial
talent, as other teams competing.

Finally, we arrive at the two mys-
tery teams of the division: Pitt and
Seton Hall.

Concerning a little known Seton
Hall team, coach Vasvary had some
interesting cominents.

“Seton Hall is a tough team to
judge. This past year they had a
very strong track team, and there-

In reference to his Panthers, Vas-
vary said, “To be honest, we don't
have in uch of a chance to do very
well. With our late-seasoii start we
fell behind.

.“As a result, the (‘()ll1})(‘Ilil()I]
will most likely prove to be just a
little above our lieatls at this point.

“We have a very hard working
group of guys," he added, "but we
will need to have a very competitive
race from our entire team if we plan

to avoid embarrassment. This is i

where we are and how tough our
conference really is.”

Vasvary believes that each race,
especially in the Big liast meet, is a
leaiiniiig experience. This expe—
rience, he said. will be instrumen-
tal in future cross—country success.

N()'I‘li: Bill lvloorehead was

day. If his hip is not 100 percent on

The 1983 Pentastar Challenge Calendar.

 
  
  
 
  
 

A chance to win a scholarship,

Chrysler product and more.

If you thought The New Chrysler
Corporation was something

different from other car makers,we’re

out to prove that you’re right. We've

developed the “Pentastar Challenge”

as a small, but deserving tribute to American
ingenuity and intellegence.

The Riddle

The challenge in the calendar is an intellectual
‘one. Within the story and illustrations, we’ve
. woven an intricate pattern of clues in five
different areas of academics; Music, Math,
Computer Science, Chemistry and Literature. There’s nothing
physically hidden or buried. All you need to unravel the
conundrums is a fairly sharp pencil and a very sharp mind.

fore it could be very likely that they

      
 

would have some quality distance _ The Reward
runners.” if you are the first to have solved any one of the five riddles,
you’ll be awarded a $5,000 scholarship, a $5,000 cash grant

Divine Comedy indeed! You’re in

“This is mostly a pain. This date

The Hoyas will be in Maryland

However, iVl('(illll‘(’ says the
Hoyas sometimes do better than
one might expect. “They play over
a wide range of their capabilities.
Most teams only swing maybe 5

swing. Sometimes they are misera-
