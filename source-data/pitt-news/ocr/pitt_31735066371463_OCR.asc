Medical faculty enters into
unionization controversy

By Michele Rhodes
Staff Writer

In an unexpected move, the
faculty of Pitt’s medical school has
taken steps informally to de-certify
its collective bargaining organiza-
tion,the Faculty Association of the
School of Medicine. '

. During departmental meetings

held in recent weeks at the medical‘

school, a series of unofficial refer-
enda were conducted, according to
University Counsel Ronald

, Talarico.

The results of the balloting indi-
cated that, by an approximate two-
to-one margin, the medical faculty
wish to be considered as a part of the
“university faculty at large" -— for a
possible vote on the issue of unioni-
zation —- rather than as a separate
unit unto itself, Talarico said.

This action may have serious con-
sequences for the effort now being
made by the United Faculty union to
organize in the provost‘s area for the
purposes of collective bargaining.

According _to all parties close to

‘the situation, if this action were to '
_ result in the inclusion of the medical
faculty in the same bargaining unit

as provost’s area faculty, a “no
union” decision would definitely be
the outcome of any collective bar-
gaining election at Pitt.

. It is generally acknowledged that
the majority of medical faculty do

"not want collective bargaining

within their school, nor do they want
to join in a union with faculty out-
side of the=School of Medicine.

In fact, the Faculty Association of

- the School of Medicine was autho-
, rized in a 1976 election to represent

Pitt’s physicians specifically because
it had no real intention of bargaining
collectively as a typical union would,

Karl K /The Pitt News
Philip Wion

according to officials on both sides

of the controversial issue.

The United Faculty is currently
seeking to bargain collectively for
the approximately 1,250 provost’s
area faculty, those in all fields but
law and the health professions. After
completing a two-year organizing
drive last fall, the union submitted a
request in January to the Pennsylva-
nia Labor Relations Board for an
election on collective bargaining.

Labor board-sponsored public
hearings to determine the appro-
priate bargaining unit will begin on
May 16. At those hearings, testi-
mony will be presented. by both the
university administration and the
United Faculty on the issue of which
faculty should be included in a_possi-
ble election on collective bargaining.

United Faculty president Philip
Wion called the recent medical

school meetings and balloting “a
heavy-handed effort on the part of
the administration to influence the

fortunes of a faculty organization.”

As such, this activity runs the risk of
being ruled an unfair labor practice,
Wion said.

Because of his group’s belief that
the Pitt administration — and not
the physicians —.— initiated the meet-
ings at the medical school, Wion
indicated that United Faculty may
respond by taking some legal action
against the administration. “Their
procedure is suspect on several
counts,” he said.

Talarico countered that the meet-
ings were initiated by the medical
faculty, with university administra-
tors present only to provide back-
ground and to answer questions.

“This was not a union-busting
activity," Talarico said, though he
did indicate that the administration
will support the medical faculty in
any attempt to decertify its bargain-
ing agent.

“It is foolish to presume that the

certification granted in 1976 reflects

the sentiments of the medical faculty
today, given that nothing has been
done in the past eight years by this
agent,” Talarico said.

In the upcoming hearings, the
administration will arguethat the
Faculty Association of the School of

Medicine abandoned its certifica- '

tion because it failed ever to take any
action on behalf of its constituent
faculty, according to Talarico.

“We’re very doubtful that their
[the administration’s] case will pre-
vail before the board,” Wion said.
“We think there is abundant evi-
dence to show thata different com-
munity of interest exists for medical
faculty than for faculty in the pro-
vost’s area.”

Pitt may still become home
for a series of unclassified
research papers commissioned
by the U.S. Air Force, despite
what one university administra-
tor called the “media exaggera-
tion" which surrounded the
announcement of discussion
between the Air Force and the
university administration.

The Air Force had identified,
Pitt as a university that could
research several broad foreign
policy topics as part of a project
dubbed “the Pittsburgh Papers"
by one university administrator.
Air Force officials and represen-
tatives -from Pitt’s University
Center for International Studies
have been holding pre-proposal
discussions on as many as 10
topic papers that could bring Pitt
an estimated $300,000.

The Air Force had been dis-
cussing the research with several
other schools when General
James C. Pfautz, a former col-
league of Pitt senior research
associate Harold Hitchens,
inquired about Pitt’s capabilities
to carry out the needed research.

“Pfautz knows of my qualiﬁ-
cations because we have worked
together  and he knows of the
accomplishments Pitt has made

in international studies and,

Pitt considering USAF reseorch,
cloims ‘medid exdggerofion’

since he is aware of all this, it is
perfectly natural that he should
feel Pitt. is qualified to do the
research,” Hitchens said in an
interview with The Pitt News.

Hitchens, who was identified
in an April 21 article in The Pitts-
burgh Press as a “top grant-
finder" at Pitt, said that the label
was misleading. He holds
appointments in both the Uni-
versity Center for International
Studies and the department of
Program and Proposal Develop-
ment in the Office of Research
and stressed that his work is var-
ied, ranging from special projects
for the chancellor to involvement
in long-range planning
documents.

Hitchens, Pfautz, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar and University
Center for International Studies
director Burkart Holzner met in
January, and shortly afterward,
Hitchens handed the discussion
over to “relevant people."

“At the time, [the Air Force]
was determining whether they
would try to go sole-source in
asking one university to write a
proposal or whether they would
go competitive and ask schools
to apply and present their capa-
bilities," explained Thomas
McKechnie, assistant director of
the University Center for Inter-
national Studies.

The center also serves a bro-
kering function —— identifying

- East and Syria, Mexico, and the

research possibilities and deter-
mining whether Pitt has the
capabilities or interest in doing
the research, according to
McKechnie.

Haley said the Air Force listed
some of the kinds of topics in
which they were interested, “top-
ics of immediate international
importance to the United States _
in terms of strategic policy con-
siderations.” Areas of possible
research included the Middle

Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. A
total of 10 topics were suggested.

Although the suggested topics
are broad, several administrators
said the research would be useful
to the Air Force. “We thought
this a very wise move," McKech-
nie said. “We thought it was wise
that the Air Force come to the
academic community and ask
autonomous, independent scho-
lars, who do public research, to
do original policy research.”

Haley said there are two kinds
of intelligence research: covert or
classified information, often
dealing with national security,
and overt, or that which informs
policy makers, and it is the latter
which involves Pitt.

“Pitt has a long-standing aca-
demic policy that its institutions
will not become involved in clas-
siﬁed research. We will only do
open, public, ‘scholarly
research,” McKechnie said.

Piff decides dgdinsf A  

Med deon resigns from post

An announcement Monday by Pitt's medical school dean Dr.
Donald Leon that he is resigning effective June 30 brought mixed
reactions from faculty and students many of whom were surprised by

“Most of the students were really surprised," said fourth-year medi-
cal student Steve Hasley.. Hasley said that the next dean “will have to
turn the department around, or it will go down the tubes.”

Leon and Dr. Nathan Stark and Dr. Thomas Detre, the senior
vice-Chancellors for health sciences, could not be reached for com-
ment and have left for meetings in Washington, D.C. In a prepared
statement, Leon offered the following reason for his decision.

“It has been my privilege to serve the School of Medicine in an
administrative capacity for 15 years. I feel it is my time, however, to
return to a full academic commitment.” ,

Leon is taking a six-month leave of absence beginning in the fall
before returning to Pitt as a cardiology professor. Several.of his
colleagues said they will be sorry to see him go. '

Leon joined the university as a cardiology instructor in 1965. He
was appointed as department of medicine vice-chairman and later
professor of medicine. He has «served as ‘dean since 1979.

Dr. Frances Drew, associate dean of student affairs, said simply
that she had “undiluted devotion to the man.” She said she does not
know the background of his decision to resign, adding that she “feels

Last November, Leon asked his assistant, Dr. Robert Olson, to
resign, ‘citing “academic incompatibility and a difference in manage-
ment philosophy.” Olson, however, maintained that he was asked to
step down because of his insistence that the university emphasize
support of the basic sciences, a priority he claimed when he was
appointed to revitalize the basic science departments which include
cell

biology, anatomy and

Olson said in an interview yesterday that he was surprised by the
announcement and suggested that problems associated with the allo-
cation of resources might have been a contributing factor.

“Allocating resources remains a problem for the medical school,”
Olson said. “[Vice-chancellor Nathan] Stark has alleged that every-
thing is fine, but there are continuing problems.”_

Commenting on Leon’s possible difficulty in allocating resources to
run the medical school, Chancellor’ Wesley Posvar said, “All deans
want more than they are getting," and added that consideration did
not affect Leon’s personal decision to resign.

Deon chosen for’ low school

Richard Pierce, professor of law at Tulane Law School in New
Orleans, has been appointed dean of the Pitt Law School, effective
July 1. He will replace John Murray, who has been dean of Pitt’s Law
School for the past seven years and who will become dean of the
School of Law at Villanova University this July.

Pierce said he does not plan any major changes in the school.

“My basic goal is to continue the constant level of improvement in
the quality of [Pitt] Law School," Pierce said. “It's a school that has
enjoyed very good leadership for a number of years. As a result, it's
been improving steadily for quite a few years.

“I’m delighted and enthusiastic to be coming to Pitt.” he said.

S. Africa divesfifure

By Ann Pugoi
Staff Writer

The university administration has
decided not to change its investment

I policy, in effect since 1978, despite

faculty and »-student demands that
Pitt sell off its stock holdings in
firms that do business in South
Africa. 0
_Rather than adopt a policy of
strict divestiture as a way of
0' denouncing the South African
government’s segregationist apar-
theid system,‘ Pitt will continue to
invest only in companies operating
in that country which follow the
“Sullivan Principles" of fair employ-
ment, Jack Freeman, senior vice-
chancellor for administration, said
in a telephone interview yesterday.

The Sullivan Principles, which
many universities use as a set of
guidelines for investment policy,
require that companies operating in
South Africa follow employment
practices such as non-segregation of
racial groups, equal pay for equal
work and training programs for
non-whites.

“The university doesn't believe in
divestment as a general policy. Most
universities do not have divestment
policies. The university‘s operating
policies are designed to overcome
the effects of apartheid," Freeman
said.

“We have already addressed that
issue several years ago. The Board of
Trustees‘ investment committee met
and considered the question of di-

-vestment but decided that the best

policy was to invest in corporations
that follow the concepts set forth in
the Sullivan Principles,” he said.

“The philosophical position of the
board is quite clear, and we have no
plans to review that position.”

Black studies professor Barbara
Sizemore, in a March 16 news con-
ference, had called the Sullivan
Principles a “cop-out” and urged the
university to divest at once. Because
the principles only pertain to the
workplace, they are ineffective in
combatting apartheid, she said.

Freeman, however, contended,
“We believe the best way to change
[apartheid] is by example. We don't
address apartheid by burying our
head in the sand.” Even if American
investors withdrew from South
Africa and refused to deal with the
white -minority regime, it would do
no good because other investors
would simply take their place, he
said.

In response to faculty and com-
munity calls for Pitt to open its stock
portfolio, the university has released
a list of III firms in which Pitt
invests. The exact number of firms
changes almost daily, as “three New
York brokerage firms compete to
return the most money to the univer-
sity," Freeman explained.

The list, released in the form of a
March 20 memo from Treasurer
Joseph Dutton to Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar, does not show how much
Pitt invests in these firms or whether
these firms do business in South
Africa.

According to Dutton, of the $140
million that Pitt currently invests in
I00-I50 different companies, only
about $1 _million-is in those with
operating subsidiaries in South
Africa.

Open letter. dated April 6, to The
Pitt News, the Black Action Society,
Pittsburghers Against Apartheid,
Pittsburgh NAACP and professors
Barbara Sizemore and Jake
Milliones:

It appears that Pitt’s shoot-from-
the-hip campus activists are quick to
demand the messengers blood for
bringing the bad message.

I refer to the matter of the Semes-
ter at Sea stop in Capetown, South
Africa, and the protest thereof as
reported in The Pitt News of March
19, a copy of which has just reached
us here on the ship in Kobe, Japan.
Several points must be clarifed at
once.

Criticism of Semester at Sea or its
administrators in Pittsburgh is
totally off-base, in view of the
exhaustive efforts of the program’s
directors to have the ship stop in
Maputo, Mozambique, instead.
When the Mozambiquan govern-
ment denied this request at the last
minute, due to a serious famine in
that country, there was simply no
choice but to stop for refueling in
Capetown.

Serious efforts were made by the
academic dean and the faculty to
educate students about apartheid
before our arrival there, and no spe-
cial trips or tours were provided by
Semester at Sea in South Africa, in
order not to encourage students to
spend money in the country. Mean-

while, on ship, our student news-
paper has regularly been publishing
articles critical of apartheid, includ-
ing Post-Gazette reprints of the
Baskin-Sears law firm dispute in
Pittsburgh. 

In fact, the shipboard student
survey—-with which the program is
now being bludgeoned by its short-
sighted opponents —~ was specifi-
cally designed as a consciousness-
raising tool for the students. If it
revealed that some of the students
liked South Africa and want to
return there to visit, it also revealed
that a solid 83 percent expressed
“disapproval" or “strong disappro-
val” of apartheid and that 97 percent
refused to buy any gold, gems or
other luxury items while there.

There are two related points to
this survey. First, that once again,
statistics have been manipulated to
satisfy the emotional leanings of the
beholders; and second, that some
overzealous activists are distorting
the findings, blowing up the 4 per-
cent of students who have pro-
apartheid feelings as a result of the
trip and ignoring the 83 percent who
found even more reason to oppose
apartheid after seeing it firsthand.

Certainly it is absurd for black
studies professor Sizemore to con-
clude, as she did in the March 19 Pitt
News, that “we created advocates,
supporters [of apartheid] and South
African propagandists.” Even more

‘I 0 '4. am

astonishing is professor Jake Milli-
ones’ verdict that “the Semester at
Sea program allowed the South
African government to use it to
propagandize."

At no time during the trip, to my
knowledge, did any South African
officials ever address any students or
student groups. Quite the contrary,
in fact. I myself led a group of stu-
dents to the staunchly anti-
apartheid Argus newspaper offices,
where we received (and I reported
on, in the March 13 Post-Gazette) a
point-by-point attack on the system
and itsinjustices.

Under the circumstances, consid-
ering how difficult it is for any
whites to travel to black areas and
vice versa in South Africa, it is
impressive that 22 percent of the stu-
dents actually did so. To conclude
that the other 78 percent are brain-
washed supporters of apartheid is
simply wrong —- as wrong as Milli-
ones’ conspiracy theory that Semes-
ter at Sea “planned to stop in South
Africa all along."

As one of the faculty members
here most opposed to the South

Letters

African visit, I too was upset by the
number of students who simply
wanted to party and ignore apar-
theid. Most of the students, how-
ever, were sensitive and adult in their
approach to the country and came
away with honest disgust at the sys-
tematic dehumanization of South
Africa’s black population.

But I must be honest and say pub-
lically that though I did not want to
stop there, I am very glad in retro-
spect that I saw the situation first-
hand. In my mind -— and the minds
of most students — apartheid is no
longer an abstract evil but a real and
living one that had to be seen to be
beheved.

Critics of the South Africa visit
overlook another important result
of the journey: the 125 or so Semes-
ter at Sea students and faculty who
did visit the black communitiesand
who spent time in the homes of
blacks and coloreds there were told,
almost without exception, that their
visits amounted to a significant
morale-booster for the oppressed
majority, many of whom are desper-
ate for contacts with Americans

 

(especially black Americans) and for
the need to know they are not
forgotten.

By completely boycotting South
Africa and making it off-limits to
U.S. students, we — and Pitt -
would be boycotting and denying
ourselves contact with the very peo-
ple about whom we claim to be con-
cerned.

It is galling to those of us who
tried, and at least partially suc-
ceeded, to make the South African
stop meaningful and productive to
be so severely criticized by people
back home who are more interested
in taking the “correct” political
stance than in actually confronting
apartheid on its own turf and relat-
ing directly to the human beings it
brutalizes. It is even more galling to
see the whole Semester at Sea pro-
gram threatened at Pitt because of it.

Let us at least get home and
explain the reality of it — and the
value of it — before any more
erroneous conclusions are leaped to!

THE SMITHS
The Smiths
Sire

With this band and its album
bearing nothing more than the
most common name in the Eng-
lish language, some might be
encouraged to overlook this
record. Don’t. The Smiths’ epo-
nomously titled debut lp offers
ll of the most hauntingly beauti-
ful songs to be heard on one disk
in quite some time. Led by the
agitated emotion of lead singer
Morrissey and followed with a
band whose musicianship is deli-
cate ——- almost reassuring - the
Smiths have come up with the
most pleasant suprise of 1984.
Musically lean, although engag-
ing throughout, it is Morrissey’s
dark lyrics and his sensitive
delivery of them that will leave

you wishing for more. Quite
simply, the best album thisgyear.

FEELING CAVALIER

Elektra

As the old sage once said to his
naive student, “Be wary of band
that release album after it has hit
maxi—single.” Such is the case
with Ebn-Ozn, whose dance hit

“AEIOU Sometimes Y” was last

summer’s cheekiest cheek
mover, but whose album bears
the telltale signs of slapdash
music written for quick capital
gain. Although Feeling Cavalier
alternates between moments of
refreshing pop originality and
typical synth-pop boredom, the
latter tends to dominate.

LOVE LIFE
Berlin
Geffen Records

The appeal of Berlin is simple;
sex always sells, and God knows,
they haven't much else to offer.
Original melodies? Nah.
Thought provoking-lyrics? Nah.
A vamping, Lolita-like singer?
Yes! Lewd subject matter? Yes!
There’s no real passion here,just
a high glossed, air-brushed,
posed picture of pretty people
fornicating. But what the heck,
kids; sex is as good an advertis-
ment as anything, so you’ll prob-
ably end up buying the product.
But be forewarned ~— after lis-
tening to Love Life, you’ll feel
sort of cheap and a bit soiled.

RECKONING
R.E.M.
IRS

It is certainly no mere coin-
cidence that R.E.M.’s humble
beginnings can be traced back
to an abandoned Athens,
Georgia, church where vocal-
ist Michael Stipe and guitar
player Peter Buck once lived.
On Reckoning, the band once
again raises eyebrows with a
jangled cathedral of sound
that wrenches itself straight
from the gut.

Although Mitch Easter
and Don Dixon’s production

  

once again keeps the band's
sound murky (by now, an
R.E.M. trademark), far more
of the band’s performance
comes shining through here
than on last year’s much-
acclaimed Murmur. The
result is a sound that is
respectful of the things
R.E.M. has done so well in
the past, but not at the cost of
closing the door on new pos-

H sibilities. In short, another

outstanding work from
R.E.M. ‘

When it comes to bunting and
sliding, Pitt baseball coach Bobby
Lewis has ample experience. His
knowledge of the two essentials
stems from the I949-SI seasons,
when he roamed the outﬁeld for
Panther coach Ralph “Sarge”
Mitterling. A

“We used to practice in this little
dirt area next to the little gym under
the stands in Pitt Stadium,” Lewis
recalls. “All we could do was prac-
tice sliding and hunting. We were the
best hunters and sliders around.”

, Lewis has made it a habit to make
the best with what he has had. After
graduating from Pitt with a B.S.
degree in education in 1952 and
spending two years in the Marines,
Lewis has made the best with blue-
and-gold baseball players.

On April 21, Lewis climaxcd his
30th season as baseball coach by
defeating Fredonia State, 4-1. The_
victory was Lewis‘s'368th, one more
than basketball coach H.C. ‘Doc’
Carlson gained from 1922-53. Lewis
became Pitt's all-time winningest
coach.

Lewis insists he doesn’t remember

— the wins and losses as well as he does

the players that earned them and the
success stories that followed, includ-
ing his own success stories - 36
years‘ worth -— which were started
as a Pitt freshman from Schenley
High School and continue today.

BUD

I949. Pitt freshman Bobby Lewis
won the starting job in right field for
the second half of the season.

Panther coach Mitterling consi-
dered Lewis, who hit .400 in his first
three starts, the finest ﬁelder on the
squad.

“When I came to Pitt, it was an
all-commuter school,” Lewis said.
“Thevpeople who went to Pitt were
Pittsburghers. We didn‘t have the
Towers or the Student Union; in
fact, just about everything was done
in the Cathedral. The library was on
the ﬁfth, sixth and seventh floors of
the Cathedral.

The Panthers played games at ,

Schenley Oval and practiced under
the bleachers next to a little gym at
Pitt Stadium. In those days, the
farthest from home the team would
venture was Penn State.

Rufus H. Fitzgerald was chancel-
lor and there was an empty plot of
land where Fitzgerald Field House
now stands. The Panther basketball
team, led by Sam David, father of
Pitt guard Joey David, played their
games at the little gym in Pitt
Stadium.

During the fall of 1948, the
Panther football team beat Penn
State, 7-0, and finished a 6-3
campaign.

“I was always fortunate as a
player to have great coaching,"
Lewis said. “ ‘Sarge’ Mitterling was
outstanding. I never once heard him
cuss. He wasn’t just a great coach,
but he was a super person also."

Lewis finished his baseball career
at Pitt with a lifetime batting aver-
age of .293.

DDCI

  
    

1955. Bobby Lewis returned to the
University of Pittsburgh and
received his Masters degree in edu-
cation. Lewis became Mitterling’s
assistant. One month before the sea-
son_was to begin, however, Mitter-
ling had a heart attack and Lewis
was named interim head coach.

In the week that Lewis was regis-
tering his initial victory as a coach,
Dr. Jonas Salk of Pitt had his polio
vaccine approved. “The Salk discov-
ery certainly stands out in my mind
as one the biggest highlights of my
years at Pitt,” Lewis said.

“It’s been a steady, good growth.
It’s been great for me as a coach; I
have the greatest selling point when
I'm talking to young men about
attending college. I have the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.”

Lewis's first Pitt team recorded a
10- I 3 mark and Pitt track star Arnie
Sowell made international news on
the oval by capturing the 880-yard
run gold medal at the Pan-American
Games in addition to a bronze medal
in the I956 Olympics.

EIEID

Hundreds of players have been
inﬂuenced by Bobby Lewis. Major
league players Doc Medich, Ken
Macha and Allen Lachowicz played
for Lewis. Pro footballers Paul Mar-
tha, Mike Ditka and Joe Walton,
too.

“I just hope that when the players '
leave that they can say that they.

enjoyed playing baseball here,"
Lewis said. “I hope that they think I
was a nice guy. I’ve always tried to be
fair and honest. I

“I don't remember the kids by the

way that they played their positions ‘

but more by what they did off the
field. Whether they went to dental
school or became Phi Beta Kappa,
that’s what sticks out in my mind."

Lewis maintains that the kids
haven't changed that much over his
30 seasons.

“In football and basketball, the
kids are so much bigger and stronger
and unless you can run like Tony
Dorsett it’s very difficult. But in
baseball you don‘t always need that.
There is plenty of room for smaller
guys," Lewis noted.

DDD

Bobby Lewis has endured ﬁve
chancellors, four athletic directors
and eight baseball fields en route to
becoming Pitt's all-time winningest
coach. Thirty-six years bring about
many memories.

He credits Tony Dorsett as the
individual who has had the greatest
impact on athletics at Pitt.

“It seemed like overnight, the four
years from when he was a freshman
until the team won the national
championship [in 1976]. He was
something special,” Lewis said.

“I'll always remember Arnie

IMEIVI

Sowell. He was running as fast as
anybody and you couldn’t tell. He
was so fluid. Don Hennon was a
pure shooter. He was an All-
American. Those are the athletes
who come to mind first.”

When confronted with comparing
himself to Doc Carlson, Lewis is
humble.

“I’m not used to all the attention
surrounding the record. People were
mentioning my name in the same
breath as Doc Carlson. He’s nation-
ally known; he wrote books. I can‘t
compare myself to him. He coached
basketball and I coach baseball.”

The ‘coaching position has
changed with the size and demands
on the athletes.

“I don‘t know of another job in
the world where a person is under
more scrutiny than a football or bas-
ketball coach. Foge [Fazio]_ and
Chip‘ [Roy Chipman] are right out in
the open. The pressure is unbelievea—
blc. They‘re not allowed to make
mistakes.

“If I decide to suicide squeeze and
it fails, not a whole lot is gonna
happen, but if Foge goes for two
points and misses, 55,000 people
second-guess him and another mil-
lion or so watch on television.
Ronald Reagan doesn't even get that
much scrutiny, because most of his
decisions are kept quiet. Have you
ever heard of anyone asking the
president of a major corporation
why he made a certain decision?

“I'm glad that I don‘t have that
pressure. To me, sports are sup-
posed to be fun. Ijust hope that with
all this talk about,the record that
people aren’t suggesting that I retire.
I still feel very young. I love my job.“

Clearance

NFL draft thinned by USFL raids

By Joe Zen
Senior Editor

National Football League
coaches went shopping yesterday in
the 49th annual collegiate player
draft and despite what some were
calling barren shelves, came away
with their share of potential
superstars.

Many took the absolute minimum
pricing route, trading high draft
positions for lower ones to ward off
overpriced players.

The Kansas City Chiefs, though,
made a bee-line for the beef section,
making former Panther defensive
tackle Bill Maas the fifth pick of the
first round. Maas, at 6-4 and 271

pounds, will challenge incumbents
Dino Mangerio and Ken Kremer for
the nose tackle position.

“I think it’s terrific," said Maas,
who married Cindy Marino on Sat-
urday. Cindy’s older brother Dan,
some may remember, quarter-
backed the Panthers before gradu-
ating to the Miami Dolphins.

“I talked with the general man-
ager from Kansas City prior to the
draft for about two weeks, and he
said that if I was still there, they
would take me. San Diego, which
had the sixth pick, also made con-
tact with me and said they would
pick me.

“But as soon as Philadelphia
named Kenny Jackson as their first
pick, the phone rang. It was a matter
of seconds. They said, ‘We just made
you our first pick.’ ” ‘

Maas was a three-year starter at
Pitt and had 22% quarterback sacks
and 118 tackles in his collegiate
career. He was the ﬁrst defensive
lineman selected in the draft.

Such a high draft position could
incite competition for his services
from the United States Football
League, but Maas insists otherwise.

“I’m not going to bargain. There is
no bargaining. I want to play in the
NFL. I want to play for the Kansas
City Chiefs,” Maas said.

In the second round, the New

' York Jets selected Pitt center Jim

Sweeney. Sweeney said he was
examined by the Jets last month but
had no idea he would eventually be
theirs.

“I’m happy they took me,” said
Sweeney. “I didn’t know where I
would be drafted. It was a surprise, a
very nice surprise."

Like Maas, Sweeney may have to
sacrifice his position to play in the
NFL. The Jets stake claim to one of
the finest centers in the land in Joe
Fields.

The 6-3, 250-pound criminology
major, however, has played every
position on the Panther offensive
line, including tight end as a junior.

They’ve got an all-pro at center,
but they talk about me playing

PREPARE FOR

guard,” said Sweeney. “I’ll play‘
wherever they want me to.”

So will Pitt tailback Joe McCall,
who was selected by the Los Angeles
Raiders. McCall's telephone failed
to interrupt his television viewing of
the draft until late in the third round.

“I was getting kinda nervous,"
laughed McCall. “Most of the scouts
said I would go by the third round. It
was just [the Raiders] and someone
else that were left. You know, after
the third round you don’t get much
money.”

The 6-1, 190-pound McCall was
assured he will not have to compete
with tailback Marcus Allen for a

I place on the Los Angeles roster.

“No, no, it’s nothing like that. I
talked to the running back coach,
and he said they play a lot of split-
back offenses, that I'd not only play
halfback but also fullback,” McCall
said.

In later rounds, Green Bay
drafted defensive back Tommy
Flynn in the ﬁfth round, and Minne-
sota drafted receiver Dwight Collins
in the sixth round.
