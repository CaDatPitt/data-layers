Brasten will stand trial on
charges of involuntary
manslaughter for the
death of “Window

years in prison. More
serious charges of volun-

Flasher grabbed

Pitt student arrested

for indecent exposure

By John Temple
Asst. News Editor

Exposed male genitalia
will be a less common
sight around the Pitt cam-
pus thanks to a two—month
investigation by the
Campus Police.

Police arrested a 19-
year-old male student last
week and charged him
with indecent exposure
after a victim identified his
photo.

Although the student is
charged with only one
exposure, police said they
believe he is responsible
for about a dozen similar
incidents around the
Cathedral of Learning.

“We believe. he is
responsible for most of the
13 or 14 exposures report-
ed since last fall,” Assistant
Director of Public Safety
Gary Moses said.

“We’re linking those
cases because of the simi-
larity.”

In about a dozen of the

cases since last November,
21 man was seen exposing
the lower half of his body
from windows in the
Cathedral. The man, who

sometimes was masturbat- _

ing, usually kept his face
hidden behind blinds.

Police began investigat-
ing in January as these
reports began to pile up.

“We came up with this
particular student by
reviewing our past
reports,” Moses said.

“We saw that this had
occurred one time before
with him.”

Most of the recent expo-
sures occurred in the early
afternoon and coincided
with the student’s classes
in the Cathedral. Police
approached the student
after a woman who had
seen the suspect’s face
picked him out of an array
of photos.

The student was arrested
last Thursday and will face
criminal and Pitt Judicial
Board charges.

Shuttle service expands
outside Oakland area

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

After looking at graduate
and undergraduate student
shuttle needs, Pitt’s
Department of Transportation
has decided to expand the
service to Shadyside, Squirrel
Hill and Pitt’s new Biotech
Center.

John Morgan, assistant
director of Parking and
Transportation, said that Pitt
is providing additional trans-
portation for those students
not serviced by the current
routes.

Recently, Pitt’s Graduate
and Professional Student
Association approached the
administration because it said
the transportation/safety fee
was not fair. GPSA said that
many grad students live in
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill,
and surveys showed less than
3 percent of grad students
currently ride the shuttle.

Director of Parking and
Transportation Bob Harkins
said that GPSA played a part
in the expansion, but it
would have happened" any-
way. He added that the
department’s intentions are to
service the students with a

greater security and greater
convenience, as well as being
environmentally conscious —
not having single-occupancy
cars driving to campus.

The Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill bus routes will be imple-
mented April 5. Each of the
two busses will have a capac-
ity of 43 people.

According to Morgan,
South Negley and Ellsworth
Avenues will serve as the
main streets for the
Shadyside bus, while
Wightman Street and Shady
Avenue will serve as the main
streets for the Squirrel Hill
bus.

Harkins said that the busses
will be driving along the PAT
routes and will also be travel-
ling Forbes, Fifth and Murray
Avenues.

“We don’t want to drive
through exclusively residen-
tial areas,” Harkins said. _

Harkins also said that the
department does not want to
compete with PAT but com-
plement it.

Both of these busses will
begin operating around 6:30
a.m., Morgan said, and oper-
ate into the evening hours.

During April and May, Pitt’s‘

College students
donate their time
and skills to tutor

By Phyliss Milligan
For The Pitt News

Pitt Project Tutor will be
using college students as
volunteer tutors to assist
children with basic reading
and math skills at three area
elementary schools.

The project, conducted
through the Graduate
School of Education, was
initiated through ‘City
Councilman Bob
O’Connor’s office. It is
being studied in hopes of
extending the project
to include federal funding
and more schools in the
future.

While there are no pre-
requisites to participate in
the program, tutors must
have an enthusiasm and
willingness to help the chil-
dren and donate two» hours
a week for tutoring ses-
sions.

“They spend an hour with
the children helping with
homework and » reading
with them,” program coor-
dinator Dr. Shirley Biggs
said. “They are also trying
to encourage the students
to enjoy reading different

kinds of literature.’’

Before the program
began, volunteers had the
chance to visit the schools
where they would be tutor-
ing.

“The students had a
chance to go and observe-
the children in the schools
and talk with the teachers,”
Biggs said. “They obtained
very specific information
on how to help the chil-
dren.”

Volunteers attend period-
ic seminars where they are
taught studying and reading
strategies, as well as tutor-
ing and motivational skills.

Janis Scalon, an education
graduate student and tutori-
al coordinator, said,
“Having an adult giving all
of his or her attention for a
long length of time .makes
[the students] feel special
and helps them to achieve
success.” .

Biggs explained how chil-
dren are targeted for the
program.

“We’re trying to reach a
segment of children that
aren’t usually considered
because they are not kids

Zombies took center stage in the

They were part of a talent show
sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council. .

First place went to the four-man a
cappella group, The Treble Makers,
who performed “Zombie Jamboree"
by Rockapella.

The group opened its act by carrying
member Jon Abucejo on stage cov-
ered with a sheet. They stood him up
and”opened‘" his coffin (complete
with an ominous --creak from
Abucejo).

Luther Van Dross.

“I feel great!” he said after the
show. “There was some good
competition.”

Simmons was accompanied on
piano, and soon the audience was
slowly snapping its fingers as he
sang.

Third place was taken by Pitt
juniors Monica White and Abena
Lewis, who were spotlighted for
an a cappella duet.

They performed “A True
Friend,” a song written by
White.

“It took me about three days to
write it,” she explained. “I wrote
itover the summer.”

Although not among the top
three acts, other Pitt students
showed a variety of talent.

Mark Yohe taught the audience
a little bit of sign language and

invited them to “sing” along as he
signed and danced to C+C Music
Factory’s “Everybody Dance

Yohe had the audience clap-
ping along, and during the rap
part of the song, “rapped” with
his hands.

Mark Oleniacz also signed, and
sang, to Mike and the Mechanic’s

_ “In the Living Years.”

Dressed in a tattered yellow
gown, Angela DeFilippo belted
out “I Dreamed a Dream” from
the Broadway giant Les
Miserables.

Other acts included: Justin
Chinka, who sang and played an
acoustic guitar; Danielle
Michelitsch, who sang the Spanish
ballad “Via Dolorosa;” and
Sherelle Teasley, who sang “Silent
Prayer” by Shanice Wilson.

Stay the course

When 75-year-old Justice Byron “Whizzer” White, a former football
player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, decided to step down he gave
President Clinton the opportunity for him to leave his mark on the
Supreme Court. Clinton will become the ﬁrst Democrat since Lyndon B.
Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall in 1967, to name a justice to the
Supreme Court.

White’s departure could rapidly bring a new philosophical bend to
the Court — no doubt a more liberal one, favoring judicial activism.
White was a Conservative on many views, including abortion rights. He
dissented from the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision saying that, “The Court
simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant
mothers, and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests
that right with suﬂicient substance to ovenide most existing state abor-
tion statutes 

The departure of White will most likely bring Clinton the first of many

seats to ﬁll on the Supreme Court. Justice Hany Blackrnun is 84 and ~

Justice John Paul Stevens is 72. Both could retire within the next four
years.

like so many things with this administration, the appointment of jus-
tices to the nation’s highest court will be a democratic issue. Republicans
in Congress neither have the strength nor the numbers to oppose a
Clinton nominee. That could be dangerous.

The Supreme Court is meant to uphold the Constitution; which in turn
guarantees the rights of individual freedoms. The existing Court has
been centrist (and fair) in its views and should remain so. A Liberal exer-
cise of federal power, in pursuit of “justice” and “fairness,” can only
serve to offset the delicate balance of things.

President Clinton must remember to appoint justices who envision a
federal government that works with individuals and not against them.
And as a poll by CBS/New Yorle Times shows that 74 percent of
Americans distrust the federal government, we think that’s good-advice.

Making Pitt proud

Students at Pitt are giving of themselves in full force. This week, fra-
ternities and sororities are competing, trying to raise money for the
Special Olympics; elsewhere, students involved in the Pitt Project
Tutor are assisting children in three area elementary schools with basic
reading and math skills.

But the students being tutored are not the only ones learning from
this project. Volunteers beneﬁt as well. They learn of the grim realities
that many children will have to deal with during the course of their
lives. As the next batch of leaders, they become more sensitive to
many of the issues gripping this country.

The project is a worthy one. Everywhere one walks, deliberate
reminders of the troubles facing young people are prevalent.
Teenagers are carrying automatic weapons through junior high school
hallways; drugs are creeping their way into suburban school districts;
and pregnant children are rapidly becoming an afterthought. The
newspapers may read that the economy is rebounding, but as it does,
America’s cities are slipping into an irreparable wasteland; and along
with them dreams of grandeur are being dashed along the rocks.

The volunteers involved with Project Tutor are well trained. They
attend periodic seminars and are taught studying and reading strate-
gies as well as tutoring and motivational skills.

Community service is a virtue. It is nice to see students giving so
much of themselves to help the community. Most important, however,
is that these students are participating because of their own personal
interest. When national service becomes coerced, such as in Clinton’s
Job Corps Training Program, the meaning of community and volun-
teerism gets lost.

These individuals are making a difference, not because they have to
but because they want to. That’s the kind of communitarian attitude
that makes a difference.

A recipe for tasty race relations

s you probably know, the
University of Pittsburgh A

community is indeed a
large one, with 22,000 students
alone plus hundreds of faculty,
staff and administrators.
Enraging a group of this size is
a monumental task, since most
people don’t care about any
one given issue. But it can be
done.

The recent campus art cen-
sorship ordeal made quite a
few people angry. But, to my
dismay, it was eventually
resolved. The issue of gays in
the military got under quite a
few skins, too, but it seems as
if it has unfortunately been
slipped under the rug. As for
racism on campus — it isn’t
going to get resolved, and it
isn’t going to disappear, so it
might do the trick. Yet, perhaps
we aren’t trying hard enough.
The effort is there, but I don’t
think everyone is giving their
all in this grand attempt to
anger the entire university
community.

So I’ve done all of you a
favor. Below are two lists: one
for white folk and one for
black folk. Follow these simple
guidelines and we’ll be well on
our way to really enraging
everysingle person here and
creating a campus that is not
only hostile, but just plain
unlivable.

WHAT WHITE PEOPLE CAN
DO:
1) Generalize and stereotype.

Since most of you college
whites are from nice white-
bread neighborhoods, you are
probably the product of ques-
tionable upbringings, especial-
ly as far as race relations, go. As

. you know, a lot of negative

stereotypes about black people
have been ﬂoating around dur-
ing the last couple centuries,
but there are a few dandy ones
you should always let sway

your opinion. For example: all

black people are on welfare; all
of them sell drugs and steal
cars; and, of course, all of them
like basketball, 405 of malt

liquor and fried chicken.
2)Pretend you lenow what’s
best for blac/es.

I read The Pitt News and I am
always pleased to see letters
from some ignorant white boy
about how he has the solutions
to all the problems African
Americans are facing both at
Pitt and across the country.
Hey, pal, thanks for sharing
your wisdom. I’m sure all the
brothers and sisters are reading
it and saying, “Hey, he’s right.
Let’s do what he says and all
our worries will be over.”
These letters are great kindling
for this racial fire we’re trying

‘to build, so keep at it.

3) Corrupt your friends.
As you sit around your apart-
ments brushing your greasy

Aaron
Forsythe

hair out of your faces, smoking
your joints and listening to the
Eagles and Led Zeppelin, don’t
forget to let your buddies know
just how you feel about black
people. There’s nothing more
healthy than a good session of
race bashing, as it helps propa-
gate that ill will that we’re all
shooting for. And the only
thing more fun than a racist is a
whole bunch of racists.

WHAT BLACK PEOPLE CAN
DO: ’

1) Use the word “racism” as
much as possible.

Bad things happen. But, as
you know, when something
bad happens to you it’s the end
product of a racist conspiracy.
If you get turned in to the
Resident Director for being dis-
ruptive, it’s racism. If you are
told to be quiet in a theater, it’s
racism. If your pencil breaks
during a test, it’s racism. There
isn’t a handier buzzword
around, since every white per-

son in a power position is

scared to death of being
accused of racial insensitivity,
so be quick to point the finger.

2) Never, ever give a white
man the benefit of the doubt.

Call him The Man. Call him a
devil. Five hundred years of
oppression have made you
angrier than hell, and reverse
discrimination is in full effect.
Try this mind—set on for size:
No white man has ever done
anything good in his life for a
black man. Not Abraham
Lincoln, not the Pope, nobody.
They’re all crackers who are
out to get you — watch your
back, because all of them,
without exception, have devot-
ed their lives to keeping you
down.

3) Be confusing as well as con-
fused.

People like Louis Farrakhan,
Spike Lee and KRS-One are all
doing their own thing to infuse
you with their personal ideas of
how African-Americans should
act. Trying to figure out your
place in this grand scheme can
probably get confusing, so it
isn’t surprising that a significant
portion of you don’t know
exactly what you want.

And to top it off, you keep
throwing white people this
tricky curve ball: “It upsets us
that white people don’t try to
understandblack culture and
black community,” comes out
of one side of your mouths,

while out of the other side, the '

loud fist-raising side, come
catch phrases like, “It’s a black
thing; you wouldn’t under-
stand!” Isn’t it nice having it
both ways? It is if you want to
upset the other side 

Angry yet? Read this again in
front of a mirror and see how
mad you get. Props go out to
those of you, white and black
alike, that realize what I’m try-
ing to do with this column. It’s
time to stop trying to be politi-
cally correct and to start
becoming mentally correct.
Chew on that. g I

Majors calls fo

‘£2 /"

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

It was pegged to be a con-
tinuance of. the honeymoon
—— a juicy media feast for a
returning legend. “Back to
the Future,” 1976 National
Champions, the whole nine
yards.

But to Pitt head coach
Johnny Majors, yesterday’s
spring foot-
ball press
luncheon
served a
more realis-
tic and per-
tinent pur-
pose: to dish out a solemn
serving of blunt reality on the
immediate future of Panther
football.

In his first “State of Pitt
Football” address since
returning to the university
last December, Majors mixed
introductions of players and
new staff members with a
stern, anything-but-subtle sta-
tus report on the plight of the
program he once led to its
highest of heights.

“This [rebuilding] program
is going to take a full-ﬂedged
effort,” Majorsisaid. “From
disciplined work ethics by the
players to the people
throughout this country who
care for Pitt, who are going to

[and] help us with facilities
that are so far behind.” _
Stopping just short of pass-
ing a hat throughout to the
assembled local media,
Majors summoned much like
a vaunted preacher on a per-
ilous-but-proud pulpit,
repeatedly and directly
addressing the problems that

Majors brings discipline
to Pitt football program

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

Discipline.

Those individuals and
teams who possess disci-
pline have the opportunity
for greatness. Those with-
out it are destined to be
left twisting in the wind.

Discipline builds charac-
ter. It provides a strong
foundation for a success-
ful program, whether it be
ballet, construction, busi-
ness or football.

Recently rehired head
coach Johnny Majors
hopes to take a team infa-
mous for illogical, some-
times illegal situations and
turn them into a cohesive,
fine-tuned unit.

“It was one of the quick-
est things I have ever seen
happen with a team,” red-
shirt sophomore Tom
Tumulty said of the three-
month turnaround. “He
turned a team with some
discipline into a disci-
plined team.”

“[Former head coach
Paul] Hackett told players
what to do with lifting and
weights, but he left it to
the players to get it done,”
quarterback John Ryan

said. “With Coach Majors,
I see a whole new atti-
tude.”

This about a man who
was hired in mid-
December and has had lit-
tle time to meet individu-
ally with his players.

“Everyone here is work-
ing much harder in the
weight room, conditioning
and in workouts,” junior
tailback Curtis Martin said.

When compared to
Majors, who refuses to
talk about his predecessor
at Pitt, former Pitt head
coach Paul , Hackett
receives low marks for
instilling a feeling of team
unity and discipline in the
Panthers.

“I think the attitude is

different from Coach
Hackett with Coach
Majors,” Jells said.

“Hackett let you get away
with a little bit more
things, where Coach
Majors won’t have it. If
you don’t do things his
way then there’s no way
— it’s his way or the high-
way.”

“I think that's one of the
things that we needed
[last yearl,” Tumulty said.

See Football, page 9

his staff must conquer if suc-
cess is to be achieved.

Majors’ three—pronged
search-and-solve agenda
includes vast improvements
in facilities, recruiting and
total team attitude.

Some verbal snippets from
yesterday’s Majors confer-
ence:

°On Pitt’s football facilities:

“We have a lot of work to get
done as far as facilities. Our
facilities are not up to par
with most people around this
country at the present time.
“It’s up to our administra-
tion  to me  and the peo-
ple that support Pitt to get
something done about it.
There are more strong pro-
grams than there are coaches.

improved facilities, attitude

Some programs will buoy —
carry a coach —- regardless
who it is.

“We have enough helmets
and shoulder pads to practice
with — we have enough foot-
balls. But we need a lot of
other things to make this a
top-quality program again.”

-On the recruiting class of
1993: “Recruiting is of the
utmost importance. This year
was a real catch-up deal
[because of the firing/late hir-
ingl. Any freshmen we can
get to help us next year
would strictly be a bonus.

“Our recruiting was below
par  but we didn’t have a
choice. [Pitt] took a few
weeks to hire a new coach
and it took me a few weeks
to hire a staff. I think we had
a salvage job. It was not a
dynamic recruiting year.”

°On discipline: “As far as
[goals to] accomplish this
spring, I would like again to
try to create and develop dis-
cipline. Attitude, enthusiasm,
intensity — things such as
that. ‘

“We’re going to build on
that attitude [for now]  and
recruit better in the future.”

Majors repeatedly rein-
forced his confidence in his
new coaching staff — which
includes former Pitt greats

Kloiber garners All-American honors

Experience. Jeff Kloiber
has it.

His résumé: starting three
straight years for Pitt,
wrestling overseas in Italy
and qualifying for the NCAA
Tournament for-the third
consecutive time.

The result: Kloiber is an
All-American. The third time

was the charm.

Using all of his experience,
Kloiber was the Panthers
only All—American wrestler
this year at Iowa City.
Finishing fifth in one of the
most difficult weight classes,
190 pounds, the Pitt junior
was upsetting everyone.

“Jeff [Kloiber] beat five
guys who had beaten him
the past two years,” Pitt head
coach Rande Stottlemyer

said. “He was very impres-
sive in an extremely tough
weight class.”

Wrestling in a formidable
weight class meant facing
multiple opponents who
have beaten Kloiber before.

well as tough opposition

Pens deal Errey for veteran defenseman Ramsey

By Jim Clark
Staff Writer

In separate deals on
Monday, the Penguins
acquired two veteran
defensemen to help for the
playoffs.

Mike Ramsey, one of the
few active players who
played for the United States
on the 1980 Olympic team,
was acquired from Buffalo in
exchange for left wing Bob
Errey.

The Penguins also re-
acquired Peter Taglianetti
from Tampa Bay in
exchange for a third—round
draft choice.

The 32-year-old Ramsey
was regarded as one of the
best defensive defensemen
of the 1980s before injuries
started to take their toll.

Ramsey, the former scap-
tain of the Sabres, plays a
solid defensive game and is
regarded as one of the best
shot blockers in the game.
He is also noted as a solid

- Stanley Cup win-

body checker and as a good‘
team player who plays hard
every night. He isn’t known
to have much offensive abili-
ty.
This season, Ramsey has
two goals and 10 points in
53 games. He has compiled a
plus-four mark with the
Sabres.

With the deals, the
Penguins go from having
five solid defensemen to
seven.

Ramsey is expected to step
right into the lineup in place
of Grant Jennings while
Taglianetti might be used to
spell Kjell Samuelsson on
occasion.

Taglianetti, 29,
was a member of
both of the
P e n g u i n s ’

ning teams. The
Penguins lost
him to Tampa
Bay back in the
June expansion
draft.

This season,

 

Errey,
28, was the
Penguins’
first-round
selection in

the 1983
entry draft.

Taglianetti led the Lightning
with a plus-eight mark and
was second on the team in

points in 61 games for
Tampa Bay.

wards, successfully shadow-

Errey had eight goals and.

Football

Continued from page 7
“Why we missed last year
and the year before was
maybe we weren’t as disci-
plined.”

Majors, a professor among
the old school of coaches,
has always fought to keep
his -football team under con-
trol.

“I believe in establishing
discipline, team effort and
the attitude that the team is
first,” Majors said. “What we
can establish [before summer
camp] is hustle, loyalty and
work ethic.”

With only weight training,
running -sessions and one
day of spring practice under
his belt, Majors has had very
little time to mold his team
into the needed fit for com-
petition on the major college
level. But when you’re on
par with Lou Holtz, Bill
Walsh, Eddie Robinson or
Bobby Bowden it doesn’t
take much to command
respect from teenaged ath—

letes.

Tack on 173 career victo-
ries, a 60 percent winning
percentage and 25 years in
coaching, and Majors doesn’t
have to strain to get his play-
ers’ attention.

“lWhen I first met him] it
felt like [I was] meeting
someone really famous,”
Ryan said.

Majors said he hopes he
can parlay this respect and
new—found attitude into a
much more important and
hopefully fruitful conclusion
— winning.

“I never have known of a
timetable about winning,”
Majors said. “Sometimes it

just surprises you.

“Wherever Coach Majors

has gone he’s been a win- ‘

ning tradition,” wide receiver
Dietrich Jells. said. “When I
was being recruited here, Pitt
was up and down. This is a
winning program with a
coach with a good winning

1 tradition behind him.

“I'm excited about playing f - ' - I - - - ' ' '

here and I'm excited with the
new enthusiasm the team
has.” '

Story. Kloiber was 1-2
against Story before coming
through at the most critical
time.

But Kloiber’s trip to Iowa
City may have been cut short
if it were not for the coaches
of the Eastern Wrestling
League. Kloiber finished
fourth at the EWL
Tournament, a tournament
where only the top three
wrestlers from each weight
class advance to nationals.

But, fortunately for
Kloiber’s ‘sake, the EWL picks
four “wild card” wrestlers
also. ‘These wild card spots
are awarded to four wrestlers
who the coaches think have
the ability to represent the
EWL well at NCAAS. Kloiber
was one of them.

Regardless of how Kloiber
got there, he was primed for
Iowa City. Back at the
nationals for the third
straight time, Kloiber was
ready to prove something.
“After his first win, he had

Stottlemyer said. “He wres-

breaking even on his feet.
His experience definitely

While Kloiber was on his
way to All-American status,

there were five other Pitt ‘

wrestlers wrestling hard on
the mats in Iowa City.

John Richey at 126, J.].
Fasnacht at 134, Steve
Budman at 150, Sean Gibbs
at 167 and Heavyweight Pat
Wiltanger all wrestled hard,
but initially, success seemed
to be in jeopardy.

“We were 1-5 in the first
round,” Stottlemyer said.
“That’s tough to take; we
were really reeling.

“But every one of our guys
lost to ranked wrestlers,”
Stottlemyer said.

Even though many of his
wrestlers fell a notch below
national recognition,
Stottlemyer was still
impressed by the six
wrestlers’ overall perfor-
mance.

“].]. [Fasnachtl wrestled
hard, and so did [Sean]
Gibbs,” Stottlemyer said.

Gibbs, who seemed to be
the Panthers’ favorite going
into the NCAA Tournament,
won three hard-fought
matches before bowing out
one match away from
becoming an All-American.
Gibbs finished 12th, four
places away from the All-

Also falling short was
heavyweight. Pat Wiltanger
and 150-pounder Steve
   Budman. Stottlemyer said
both wrestled hard and
gained respect through each
of their abilities and desires.

Pitt also gained respect by
their strong team finish. In
the final dual—meet Top 25
rankings, the Panthers
placed 23rd. And this past
weekend at Iowa City, Pitt
finished 30th among the
nation’s elite.

YOU ONLY GO
AROUND ONCE

How would you spend tomorrow if you
knew it was your last day? What do you think life
is all about? You might do something to become
famous so you could endure in history.
Frighteningly, Sirhan Sirhan thought this way.
After shooting Robert Kennedy he said: ”They can
gas me but I am famous. I have achieved in one
day what it took Robert Kennedy all his life to do.”

The Waterski Club is
having a meeting *
3/24/93 at 8:15 pm at
  the WPU 5th floor
cubicle.

T-shirts are in!

If tomorrow was your last day you might do
good for others. But what assurance do you have
that your efforts will be for good? For example,
feeding the poor may save lives or prolong misery.
Neither hope for fame nor hope for doing good are
sure hopes. .

Perhaps lack of sure hope in such things is
why you-might spend your last day partying. You
might feel the only sure way you ‘can make your-
life worthwhile is to live it‘for yourself. Yet isn't
such living without hope? 15 that all there is?

But if God exists and Jesus rose from the dead
then realigg is different. You are unique. Your
relationships and achievements are infused with
eternal significance. There is a God who is reaching
out to you and you can reach back. You do only go
around once, so what is life all about?

ALL Newcomers are
welcome

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday‘, March 24, 1993 1 1

Majors

Continued from page 7
Matt Cavanaugh [tight end
coach] and Tim Lewis [defen-
sive backs] - but cautioned
thateven the greatest group
Of coaches cannot succeed
without able bodies to exe-
cute the coaching.

“I can guarantee you we’ve
got a good staff,” Majors said.
“But again, you can’t win
without players. Nobody
knows that more than me.”

While Majors waxed: nostal-
gic On the rich past of Pitt
football, he pointed to a lack

Of sustained leadership as the
major factor in the recent
demise Of the program he
once led to the summit,
namely 1976 National
Champs.

“This is a school that has a
great tradition,” Majors said.
“But the tradition has never
been maintained Over a peri-
od Of time because Of some
lack of continuity.

“Pittsburgh needs to find a
way — and I certainly will be
a part of it, I hope - to build
Our tradition again .. and

maintain it once it's there.

With all the anticipation for
the coming season, Majors
offered a semi-serious plea
for steadfast support on the
part of rejuvenated Panthers
fans.

“We have so far to go,”
Majors said. “All I ask is
patience. I feel that if
you’re just patient for a short
time, in about 10 years we’ll
be back to the future again.”

PIGSKIN NOTES: Majors’
thoughts On the team’s first
spring practice: “I felt like

there were a lot Of people
who didn’t know what it was
like to lay it On the line —
minute after minute,” Majors
said. “A few of them had no
earthly idea. But I found that
the overall nucleus Of the
squad had a good attitude, a
very positive approach to the
program.”

Spring practices resume this
Thursday and Friday with
workouts from 2:30 to 5 p.m.
The annual spring game is
slated for April 17 at Pitt
Stadium.
