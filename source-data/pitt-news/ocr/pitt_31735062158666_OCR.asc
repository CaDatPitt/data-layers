Wherein The Program
Of Free Wassermann
A Tests Is Summarized

By MELVIN ROGOW

With a tremendous deadline
day rush, the free \7Vassermann
tests concluded VVednesday,
show that a total of l.,784 Uni-
versity students had taken the
syphilis-detection examination.

This ﬁgure includes 1,240
men, 409 women who have al-
ready taken the test, 135 women
who have made appointments to
take the test within the next
week.

In addition, approximately 50
dental school students not counted
above take the Wassermann each
year under compulsory order.

The campaign was sponsored
by The Pitt News, and received
the whole-hearted cooperation of
the student health services, under
the direction of Dr. H. C. Carlson,
director of the men’s division, Dr.
Auleene Jamison, director of the
women’s division, and their assist-
ants, Dr. Paul Zehfuss, and Miss
Pauline Thatcher.

City's Facilities Enlarged

The blood extractions were
made by the health services, and
were then sent down to the City’s
Department of Public Health to
be analyzed.

As the plan originally was, 150
test tubes were to be brought to
the laboratories each week, but
the interest shown by students
was so great that the city labora-
tory facilities were enlarged, and
full time was spent on test tubes
sent down by the University. Dr.
I. H. Alexander, director of Pub-
lic Health, and Dr. 0. N. Elsa-
man, head of the laboratory di-
vision, and his assistants, J. A.
Walkowski, and Miss Janet
Slease, were forced at times to
work overtime analyzing for stu-
dent's tests.

Predictions made by student
leaders and administration of-
ﬁcials that not more than one to
four hundred students would
take the test, were surpassed as
the health services clipped off a
better than 100 a day average for
the two and one-half weeks of
the campaign.

N 9 ‘Distinct Positive

The agreement made by The
Pitt News with the health _ser-_
vices, and the department of pub-
lic health, was that no names, and
no figures or statistics showing
prevalence of syphilis in the Uni-
versity was to be revealed.

This much, however, can be
told. Of the over 1,700 students
who took the test, there was not
one distinct positive. We under-
stand that there may have been
some on the border line, but it is
amazing that no four-plus syphilis
showed up. “As a matter of fact,”
said Dr. Jamison, “I cannot be-
lieve that there are no deﬁnitely
positive syphilitics in a group as
large  University. .

“It is probable that those people
who may have suspected that
they had the disease did not take
the test. The health services urge
those who do suspect themselves,‘
to go to a private doctor and take
this test.

‘‘If syphilis is present, she con-
tinued, “it is best that the._,__stu—
dent know about it, so that it
may be treated, and cured.’’_

The only disappointment of the
entire project was the failure of
the faculty and administration
members to take advantage of this
test-——brought to the campus as a

of the yearbook.

According to the Owl busi-
ness head, three University
schools have listed nearly 100

Possibility that Men’s Debating
Association’s ﬁrst debate on camp-

will be broadcast over a national
radio hookup was disclosed today
by, ,\lV=,i,1li§,a>I\'Il  C38, manager

been completed, declared Stark,
it is certain that the subject to be
discussed will be the national Pi
Kappa Delta question, “Resolved:
That the National Relations Board
be empowered to enforce arbitra-
tion in all industrial disputes.”

Stark said, “Efforts are under-
way to arrange the meeting with
a group of nationally-known de-
baters who will be en route
through the city ‘about the ﬁrst
week in December.

“Embryonic plans also call for
the meeting to take place on
campus, at a dinner to be attend-
ed by men and women debaters
and a few select guests.”

Holiday Note

Because of last Monday’s
celebration, there will. be -no
official football holiday follow-
ing the Nebraska game.

Explains E. Ernest Rose, D38,
president of SFA. “In view of
the fact that students have
taken an unauthorized, unor-
ganized holiday following the
Notre Dame game, the Execu-
tive Committee of SFA has
been forced to abandon plans
for an organized victpry cele-
bration in the event of a vic-
tory in the Nebraska game.”

ber-recruitment plan. The ﬁrst
900 students moving into the
block section will be used for the
maneuvers.

Schultz, BA39, and William Mc-
Kenna, C38, under the new plan
for the cheering section equip-
ment will be given out at the
game. The capes and hats will be
collected at the close of the third
quarter.

Praising the results of the dem-
onstration block, at the Tech
game, Schultz asked for continued
co-operation from the student
body. “Often the effectiveness of
the block is lost to the students
because they cannot see the man-
euvers,” he said. “We hope they
will accept our congratulations

at the Tech game.”

Students in the block should be
in their sections by 1:15 o’clock.
Each section is outlined in white

Editor, The Pitt News:

The statements on Telepathy
attributed to Dean Root and Dr.
Dietze may by some be interpreted
as being directed at the summary
of my own talk on ESP before the
CFA meeting of Nov. 5, as given
by Mr . Robert Brown in the Pitt
News for Nov. 8.

This implication may have been
furthest from the minds of Dean
Root and Dr. Dietze, but to pro-
tect myself "against misunderstand-
ing please permit me to state that
I believe Mr. Brown’s summary
was somewhat misleading.

I was particularly careful to
quote Wundt’s reputed statement

} that if telepathy were possible, all

his work was in vain; I pointed
out the great difficulty of inter-
preting such statistical results; I
emphasized the need for skepti-
cism, etc, etc. These facts can be
verified by going to someone who
heard my address, Professor Swar-
tzel, for example.

Since all of us apparently are in-
terested in seeing that no false im-
pressions get abroad, let me also
add in justice to Dr. Rhine that he
has carefully considered Dr. Coo-
ver’s work (as I pointed out in
some detail in my talk).

Dr. Rhine claims that Coover’s
work shows that he did have ex-
ceptional students (see Rhine’s
Extra-Sensory Perception, p. 21,
and New Frontiers of the Mind, p.
33). The significance of this fail-
ure to follow up the work of some
of the subjects was (to my knowl-
edge) first pointed out by‘ F.C.S.
Schiller in his article in Encyclo-
pedia. Britannica.

Moreover, and still in the inter-
est of preventing the spread of
misconceptions, let me comment
on the statement, “Professor
Rhine’s theory is inconsistent with
all the principles of psychology
and mathematics.” _ ,

Dr. Rhine has presented no
“theory,” and even ifihe had one
could only say that this theory is
inconsistent with the principles of
this or that “system” of psychol-
ogy. (For an attempt at explain-
ing Rhine’s results in perfectly
natural termssee Dr. V. M. Lem-
mon’s article, “Extra-Sensory Per-
ception,” Journal of Psychology,
1937, 4, 227-238). Frankly, I do
not know what "anyone can mean
in this case by the statement that

-such a theory is inconsistent with

the principles of mathematics.‘
Without in any way wishing to
appear as the champion of any-
thing (except a fair picture of any
situation), let me make, it clear
that my address of last Friday
was based not only on a reading of

the literature over a period of
years, but also on a first hand
knowledge of the work being done
at Duke University.

I am sorry if Mr. Brown’s sum-
mary gives rise to any false im-
prssion, and I equally regret that
none of the psychologists were
present at the meeting to help me
prevent the spread of any such
misconceptions.

Respectfully yours.
OLIVER L. REISER.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Having just laid aside your
latest edition of “JOE MILLER’S
JOKE BOOK” we have again
been cast into dank, dark, dismal,
depths of despair by your persist-
ently destructive treatment of all
subjects deemed worthy of space
in the aforementioned jokebook.
Is there, Mr. Editor, no hope for
the future of our civilization? Is
there no little ray of light ﬁlter-
ing through the gray, bleak clouds
that apparently engulf us?

MR. WADDELL IS NO GOOD.
We fail to see why one who has
been chosen as a candidate for a
high public office should be the
target for the insipid quips of a
school—boy news-hound; or, per-
haps we’re wrong———PERHAPS.

THE VOTERS OF PENNSYL-
VANIA ARE NO GOOD. Again
our budding news-hawk dares to
bleat against the “MANDATE OF
THE PEOPL .” I ask you in the
words of the immortal Shakes-
peare, “What meat does this our
Caesar eat, that he becomes so
great?”

THE CURRENT MOVIE AT-
TRACTIONS ARE NO GOOD.
Our stellar critic breezes into the
local cinema on an “Annie Oak-
ley” and thunders out with a skull
full of adverse criticisms, contra-
ry to the views of accepted critics.
Not one of these free attractions
has received the commendation of
this dyspeptic pseudo—inte1lect. In
the words of Disraeli, “He seems
to be inebriated by the exuber-
ance of his own verbosity.”

THE FACULTY IS NO GOOD.
Higher education is threatened
because the faculty refuses to take
a Wassermann. We compliment
the courageous reporter who
pierces the veil of secrecy so
strongly advocated by the editor-
ial board of your paper.

THE CONSTITUTION IS NO
GOOD. But, the constitution guar-
antees freedom of the press. Please,
Mr. Saffron——don’t bite the hand
that feeds you. (Writer’s note-—
brilliant satirist that you are.)

Please, Mr. Editor, alleviate our :

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1937

distress. Is there nothing good
in  Universe of ours, or shall.
we trip up to our little room and
turn on the gas?

' Respectfully yours,

S. J. McGhee, Jr., L39; W. W.
Gregory, L39; E. H. Carney,
L39; J. S. Ruffner, L40.

Editor’s Note: Also in the words
of your immortal Shakespeare: “A
ﬁne volley of words, gentlemen,
and quickly shot off.” To “allevi-
ate your distress,” we suggest
that you “trip up to your little
room” and turn off the gas.

A——'1'o leam a profession, to get¢
cultured, and to be a good citizen.

Q-—Uhuh. And how will school
teach him to be a good citizen?

A-—He ought to learn something
about the government of his coun-
try, the principles on which it is
run, how to be an intelligent voter
—you know.

Q——Do youthink he ought to
-discusse the shortcomings of his
‘government?

A-—-No. Because such criticisms
usually come from men who are
slightly unbalanced, who are mad
at the world because they couldn't
get far themselves.

Q——Then every critic of the
-status mm is slightly screwy?

A—-—Eh . . . not exactly, but I
think we've had too much can!-

Q-—That also holds good for
more than half the wage-earners
in this country who, in 1929, did
not earn enough for what is con-
sidered a minimum of health
and decency for their families?

A—Wcl1, everybody can't be
-equal.

Q—All right, let’s take another
angle. Should controversial sub-
jects and a study of the so-called
“isms” be talked over in class?

A—No. Students at college age
are too immature to judge, too
fickle, and so they fall under the
sway of red professors who pound
radicalism into their heads.

Q—-Isn't true education an at-
tempt to let students see all as-
pects of a question, pro and con,

Pitt,   Nebraska
Meet At Stadium

‘ Western Team,
Proven Strong,
Tests Pitt

Spotlighted for the second suc-
cessive week as a participant in
the nation’s “big” game, Pitt’s
charging Panthers meet an oppo-
nent of long standing when they
battle with Nebraska tomorrow
afternoon before the second larg-
est audience ever assembled in
the huge Stadium saucer.

There will be 71,360 people in the
Stadium tomorrow afternoon and
that includes the personnel of each
team. Every available ticket has
been sold for more than two weeks
and an eager public will watch
the Panthers, reputed to be the
finest football team in the country,
rub bruises with the Cornhuskers,
acknowledged to be the strongest
eleven that has faced them this
season.

TOPS IN DEFENSE

“N ebrasxa will present the most
ruggeddefense that we have sent
our backs against all year.
are a ﬁner defensive unit than
even stubborn Fordham. In addi-
tion, they have an offense that has
proved that it is powerful enough
to score touchdowns that win ball
games against strong foes,” said
Dr. Jock Sutherland in speaking of
Saturday’s opponent.

Coach Biff Jones, late of the
Army and serving his ﬁrst term
at Nebraska as successor to Dana
X. Bible, brought into Pittsburgh
this morning a formidable unde-
feated record.

Opening with a triumph over
Minnesota, 12-7, the Cornhuskers
were immediately recognized as a
leading football power. Substan-
tiation was given with the sting
they handed Indiana, 7-0, a few
weeks later’. in Lincoln. These
two teams lead the Big Ten Con-
ference.

NEBRASKA TIES

Only blurs on the Nebraska rec-
ord are two ties. Both are ex-
plainable. Oklahoma ,held Ne-
braska 0-0 on a soupy, muddy,
unplayable gridiron. Last week,
Kansas, a Big Six power, dead-
locked Nebraska, 13-13. The Corn-
huskers played this game, admit-
tedly so, with their minds on Pitt.
The second and third team played
most of the game. When a touch-
down was needed in the ﬁnal pe-
riod, Nebraska marched 80 yards,
uninterrupted, to get it.

Jones has brought a veteran
team to Pittsburgh. The Pan-
thers remember, only too well,
center Charley Brock. They se-
lected him on their All-Opponent
team last season and he is made
up of All-America stuff.

Johnny Howell at quarterback
has seen much Pitt-Nebraska ac-
tion. He’s a great ﬁeld general
and particularly impressive in
backing up the line. Tackle Fred
Shirey from Latrobe will be the
Cornhuskers’ acting captain to-
morrow. Two years ago, at the
time of the last Nebraska visit, he
was a standout.

Paul Amen and‘ Elmer Dobr-
man, pass-receivers extraordin-
ary, will be at the ends. Shirey’s
tackle mate is Ted Doyle. Eng-
lish and Mehring are the start-
ing guards with Brock at center
completing the forward wall per-
sonnel.

Jack Dodd and Andrews do the
halfbacking for the Cornhuskers
with Bill Callihan at fullback.
Johnny Howell will direct the
team from the ﬁeld.

LINE-UP INDEFINITE

Coach Jock Sutherland ls not at
all certain about his starting
line-up. Bill Daddio, evidently,
is still far from playing shape.
And the Notre Dame game--had
its injury toll with Curly Steb-
bins being laid up. He is suffer-
ing a bad leg, and will be unable
to start. Sutherland has indicat-
ed that Johnny Urban will take
his place.

Nebraska has shown an effective
passing attack. And the only
scores that }have been made
against Pitt this year came in that
manner. Two touchdowns were
scored against the Gophers via the
air and the winning marker
against Indiana was the result of
a run after a shovel pass had
been thrown.

Pitt’s starting line-up will prob-
ably include Souchak and Hoff-
man, ends; Matisi and Delich,
tackles; Hensley, center: Lezous-
ki and Petro, guards; Michelosen,
quarterback; Goldberg and Ur-
ban, halfbacks; and Patrick at
fullback.

Nebraska has only defeated
Pitt once during the long series,
that being the ﬁrst game in 1921
when the score was 10-0. There
have been two scoreless ties, but
the remaining games have been
Pitt victories. Last year the Pan-
thers, with a burst of power that
was reviewed last week, won,
19-6.

Football Set-Up

Harvey Rocker, director of in-
tramural sports, opens the biggest!
touch football program undertaken
in the history of the University
by completing schedules for the
Independent and Orientation elim-
ination tourneys.

In the Independent league
Rooker has lined up ten teams.
Six games are scheduled for each
week. In the opening round Mon-
day, the Politicos meet the Ho-
mines Legis, a law school team,
and the Chem E’s battle the Metal-
lurgists.

Wednesday Newman Club en-
counters the winners of the
first game mentioned above
and the Industrial Engineers see
action against the Chem ES and
lVIE’s survivor.

Rooker urges all of the teams
entered in the Independent league
to get their dollar fees in before
Monday noon or be subject to
ﬁne.

The University’s ﬁrst attempt to
show an orientation league has
culminated in the formation of
twelve teams in an elimination
tourney.

Hostilities start Tuesday. All
the freshman orientation classes
are scheduled with the exception

ors in each class are asked to
meet with Mr. Rocker in his office
atop Trees Gym, Monday at 1:30
p. m. .

The customary dollar fee and a
list of players are required and
the meeting is compulsory.

Title-Holders,

Eliminated

Literally speaking,,dynamite ex-
ploded all over Schenley Oval last
Tuesday and all but blew Kappa
Sigma’ and Phi Gamma Delta
right off the field as Lambda Chi
and Phi Delta Theta completely
smothered the defending cham-
pion and runnerup in what will
prove to be the season’s greatest
upsets.

Lambda Chi, in startling fashion,
pushed Kappa Sig back and forth
over the sod, holding them to one
miserly ﬁrst down, and at the same
time clipped off two touchdowns
to earn a very lopsided victory.

After holding the defending
champs in their own territory for
almost two periods Lambda Chi
took the ball on a poor punt on
the Kap’s 25 yard line and from
there passed over the goal line,
Jimmy Mann to George Stimple.

PASSES SCORE

Lambda Chi’s final score came
in the third canto when Mann
again passed for a touchdown to
Benny Tack. The final score was
Lambda Chi 12, Kappa Sig 0.
Lambda Chi featured a fast charg-
ing line that all but rushed Kappa
Sig into the ground. For the Kap-
pa Sigs at center, Bernie Summers
showed especially well.

In the Phi Delt-Phi Gam affair
Phi Delt put on a grand display of
defensive work to hold Fiji at bay
while on their own goal line in
the first period, and from there
went on to win 7-0.

Phi Gam had previously passed
to the goal line from midfield but
here Phi Delt braced and turned
them back four times to take the
ball on downs. ’ T V

CASHDOLLAR STARS

Cashdollar booted the ball out
of danger and from this point on
it was Phi Delt all the way. Fiji
found the Phi Delt line too much
to cope with and was forced to
give way in the face of their fast
rushing.

Phi Delt’s winning touchdown
came in the third period when
Cashdollar flipped a long one to
Ted Lyons, who in turn raced
down the sidelines from the thirty
to score.

Phi Delt in winning showed a
fast hard charging line that should
give plenty of trouble along the
fraternity front and a good second-
ary defense. _

Lambda Chi and Phi Delt see ac-
tion again next Tuesday when
they meet Theta Chi and Sigma
Chi, respectively, in second round
tilts.

Hill And Dalers

Head For lC4A
Championship

To cap what has been a fairly
successful season, the Panther har-
riers and Coach Olson will, leave
early tomorrow morning for New
York and the IC4A championship
cross country meet to be run in
New York’s Van Cortland Park
Monday morning.

In their dual meets the Pan-
thers romped over Purdue. Beth-
any, Wayne university, and Tech;
and, in turn, were thoroughly
romped over by Penn State, leav-
ing them a four won-one lost dual
meet record for the season.

It was just last Saturday that
the Pitt boys were beaten so de-
cisively by Penn. State at State
College. All of those State boys
will be in the IC4A championships.
And, besides the Lions, strong
cross country teams will be enter-
ed by Syracuse, who in turn de-
feated the Lions, Cornell, and M1-
chigan State.

SPARTAN S FAVORED
Michigan State is the strongest
of this group of strong competi-
tion. In the past four years the
meet has been dominated by the
Spartans, and last year they won
the IC4A trophy permanently for
having been in the number one
payoff spot four successive years.
When Carl Olson was asked
what he thought his runners would
do against this collection of strong
harrier squads he stated brieﬂy,
“Last.” ,
But the Panthers probably stand
a better chance to finish in the
scoring than Olson’s pessimistic
prediction would indicate. Even
Olson admits the George Zambor-
sky may have a good day and cross
the finish line among the first
twenty.
N0 EXPERIENCE
Then there is the added hope
that either Ben or Casimir Kopec
may ﬁnd themselves in this meet,
and score, a point or two for the
Panthers. And should Bob Cogs-
well have another day like the one
in Detroit against the Wayne Tar-
tars earlier in the season, he might
also score a point or two.~ '
But then again on the gloomy

side, experience counts 3. lot in
these major tournaments, with
several hundred of the best col-
lege cross country men lining up
at the starting line. Experience is
the one thing that the Pitt boys

Paintings Hung
In Library
Reading Room

Intended both to provide at-
mosphere for the rooms and to
arouse an interest in art among
the students, the ﬁrst series of
paintings have been hung by the
department of ﬁne arts in the
men’s reading room and the Re-
serve reading rooms of the li-
brary.

Most of the pictures are pro-
cessed prints, which imitate the
brush strokes and colorings of the
original oils. The originals are
hung in galleries all over the
world.

Among the pictures in the Re-
serve reading room is Vincent
Van Gogh's “Boats: St. Maries.”
Van Gogh is the noted Dutch im-
pressionist. Others include Oscar
Kokoschka’s
Pierre Auguste Renoir’s “Venice:
St. Marks;" and Andre Derain's
“The Great Pine.” The original
“Great Pine” was destroyed in
the Crystal Palace ﬁre.

American painters are repre-
sented by Rockwell Kent's “Win-
ter Landscape,” the original of
which is hanging in the Metropol-

itan museum galleries in New
York City.

Two copies of Pieter Brueghel’s -
work, “Wedding Feast” and

“Kirmess," are hung in the men's
reading room on the sixth floor.
Also hanging in the men’s read-
ing room is the Marie Goth
“Stephen Foster," which was pre-
sented to the University library
by Josiah Kirby Lilly.

Westinghouse
Workers Study
As Graduates

A Holbrook Announces
Largest Registration

More than 150 engineers of the
’Westinghouse Electric and Manu-
facturing company have register-
ed for the University-Westing-
house engineering courses this
fall. Their registration makes the
1937-38 Graduate Engineering
School the largest in its history
and one of the largest in the coun-
try, Elmer A. Holbrook, dean of
School of Engineering, announced
Wednesday.

In charge of the program is Dr.
H. E. Dyche, professor and head
of the electrical department.
About 30 Westinghouse scientists
are included among the lecturers.
All those in charge of administra-
tion and instruction of the courses,
however, have received regular
appointments on the staff of the
University, and hence credits
earned in the various courses are
recorded as resident credits.

University faculty members
participating in the program in-
clude Dr. A. H. Worthing, Mary
E. Warga, Dr. Elmer Hutchinson,
and Dr. D. R. Inglis of the physics
department; Dr. M. M. Culver, Dr.
James S. Taylor, and Dr. A. E.
Staniland of the mathematics de-
partment; Dr. J. E. Amos of the
School of Business Administration;
and Dr. J. Stanley Gray, assistant

professor of psychology.

During the ten years of ex-
istence of the University-Westing-
house plan, the University has
granted 74 masters’ degrees and
six doctor’s degrees, Dr. Dyche
revealed. ’

Government
Group Applies
For Charter

By GERALD ZISKIND

Under sponsorship of the Gov-
ernment Service. division of the
University, a charter for the in-
auguration of a professional fra-
ternity, to be known as Gamma
Sigma Phi, is now pending for
approval before the Student Fac-
ulty Association.
The present Curtis Club, serv-
ing as a nucleus for the fraterni-
ties chartered membership, will
accordingly disband and be ab-
sorbed into the fraternity.

Having as its aim the fulﬁll-
ment of_- fundamental and prac-
tical objectives, the fraternity
seeks to achieve far more than an
atmosphere of sociability. It
seeks: to serve as an instrumen-
tality in persuading government
departments and officials to the
advantages of employing those
speciﬁcally trained, through spe-
cial college curricula, in govern-
ment service.

In order to assure an ‘exception-
ally high caliber of membership,
stringent restrictions ‘will be
placed upon applicants. ,

First, the studentmust be tak-
ing Government Service, in which
he has established at least a B
average. Second, a vote of ap-
proval by the entire fraternity is
needed.

Tapping of new members will
take. place once a year, generally
during the spring season.

‘Only Fanatics
Will Save Us’

Declares Pastor
By ROBERT LEON

In a ﬁery and dramatic
speech, Dr. Bernard C. Clausen,
pastor of the First Baptist.
church, and chairman of the
Pittsburgh Community Forum,
addressed the ﬁrst of a series
of Pitt’ Peace Council sessions
Wednesday at 12:30 o'clock, in the
Cathedral.

Discussing “Concrete Roads to
Peace” he limited his discussion
to one road to peace and berated
the present generation for its slug-
gishness and impassiveness in the
face of real danger.

Only when we are able to whip
ourselves into a frenzy of enthu-
siasm over the mere thought of
war instead of waiting till war
actually exists,” said Dr. Clausen,
“will we be taking steps toward
its abo1ishment.”

He pointed out that if only one-
tenth of the energy and emotion
generated by a. football game. only
one-tenth as well directed, were
turned to the purpose of promot-
ing peace, we would lift civiliza-
tion to new and higher levels.

“It is only a band of fanatics,”
said Dr. Clausen, “who will defy
anything and anybody for the
cause of peace who will save us
from the imminent danger of war.”
The other speaker at the meet-
ing was Leopold Koeberlein, C38,
editor of The Pitt News, who dis-
cussed his ideas toward a program
of peace. Among the points made
in his speech, which preceded Dr.
Clausen’s, was the value of “hor-
ror” literature which painted war
in its true color and did not glorify
it in the manner of so many novel-
ists.

The meeting was presided‘ over
by John Fritzmeier, C39, chair-
man of the Pitt Peace Council.
who introduced the speakers.
