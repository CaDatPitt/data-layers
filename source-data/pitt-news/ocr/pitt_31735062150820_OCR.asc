Speaks Here Today

  Former Administrator to Talk  
On ‘Freedom Faces the Future’

Max Brauer, exiled German expert on municipal administration,
political and social sciences, will address Pitt Town meeting today on

“Freedom Faces the Future.”

Sponsored by the Universal Christian council and Federal Council

of Churches, Brauer will speak at
1:30 o’clock in 132 C-thedral. He
has spoken on topics taken from
his own experiences and is consid-
ered as the most outstanding of the
exiled German speakers.

Brauer’s appearance dire-cts at-
tention to the problem of the liber-
ty—loving refugees from Europe,
both Christian and Jewish, and his
address’ will describe spiritual,’ po-
litical, and personal freedom meet-
ing the threat of regimentation, ac-
cording to advance press releases.

As mayor of Altona, a German
city near Hamburg with a popula-
tion of 300,000, his administration
was featured by the erection of
hospitals, public homes for work-
ers and a large power plant. Dur-
ing his term in office slum clear-
ance projects were also started.

Being a strong opponent of the
Nazi party, Brauer held a position
in the Prussian senate for 10 years.
When the Nazi party came into
power he left Germany for China
and there in 1933 he represented the
League of Nations as a specialist
on municipal government.

When Germany brought pressure
on the League, causing its dissolu-
tion, Brauer came to America and
since that time has lectured before
audiences in churches, colleges, and
other groups throughout America.

Pitt Town meeting, originally
scheduled for Monday was held
over until today because of circum-

stances “beyond our control,” ex-
plained William Seyler, C42, who
recently replaced Esther Marcuson,
C41, as chairman.

Wri.te Account

About Typical Education in 1350

Way back in 1850, when the near-
est thing to jitter-bugging was the
minuet, and gallant southern gen-
tlemen sipped mint juleps in mag-
nolia-scented gardens while rebelli-
ous young Yankees shouted of “all
men being created equal,” and
"Uncle Tom’s Cabin” was favorite
abolitionist theater fare .

. . at-areal education consisted
of a mastery of the old classical
subjects-—Latin, Greek, mathemat-
ics, and so’ pn. “ Bookkeicfpim-3

ject of which is.-to give you Kn‘-‘!W1'

These were the -evducationaal con-
ceptions widely held’ at that time,
according to an article in the cur-
rent magazine of the Western Penn-
sylvania Historical society, writ-
ten by Dr. Stanton C. Crawford,
dean of the College, and Dr. John
A. Nietz. professor of education.

The article, “Student Life in the
Ohio Valley Ninety Y°81‘S.. Ago.”
comments on the nature of academ-
ies and seminaries, their curricula.
student‘ activities, and health of
students as revealed by letters of
a group of students at the time.

Most of the letters were written
to Mary Porter Crawford, and

have been preserved by her son,
W. A. Crawford of Erie.

Describing his life at Wellsburg
academy in 1849, George Porter,
grandfather of his namesake, Pro-
fessor George Porter of the Carne-
gie Institute of Technology, con-
fessed failing geometry and substi-
tuting bookkeeping.

The article explains that in addi-
tion to the so-called disciplinary
subjects and the "non-disciplinary
or useful” subjects, most aca-
demies taught numerous other sub-
jects including natural phiyosophy
(physics), astronomy, English and
debating; geography, and history.

Besides discussion of subjects
which the students were taking at
the time, the letters frequently
mention student activities and
boarding life. Most emphasized ex-
tra-curricular activity in most acad-
emies was the literary society.

Elocution and debating provided
students with an outlet for their
enthusiasm and spirit of competi-
tion. the authors claim.

Life in the Steubenville Female
seminary, attended by Mary Porter
during 1849 to 1854, and in Xenia
Female seminary, as well as Wash-
ington college and Beaver acad-
emy is also described by means of
these historical letters in the ar-
ticle.

Something had to give!

Two strong men were on differ-

Pitt Players office on the eighth
ﬂoor. One wanted in and one
wanted out.

The one on the inside didn’t
want the one on the outside to get
inside. So they both pushed, and
who was the goat? The door.

There’s a sign on the new door
that says:

“This door is made of very thin

Pearce Speaks

On Bard’s Play

Making his second appearance
on campus within the last two years,
Samuel Pearce, lecturer for the
Theater guild of New York city,
will discuss “The Stage History of
Shakespeare's ‘Twelfth Night,’ ”
this morning at 9:30 o’clock in Fos-
ter memorial.

Last year he presented. a talk on
“Hamlet” the quality of which mer-
ited another appearance at the Uni-
versity according to Dr. Ford E.
Curtis, associate Ptofessor of Eng-
lish.

Pearce has been connected with
the theater for the past ten years
as actor, stage manager, and book-
ing agent. He has been associated
with the guild for the past two
years.

With the use of colored slides,
Pearce is able to describe various
stage settings and props used in the
production of “Twelfth Night.” He
will explain the evolutionary pro-
ccss which the staging of the play
underwent until it reached its pres-
ent form.

This discussion will make clearer
the background of the Shakespear-
ian production which is scheduled
for the Nixon theater next week.

Theta Furs, Money
Stolen Yesterday

Two fur coats, three typewriters.
and $20 in cash were stolen from
the Kappa Alpha Theta house, 200
North Belleﬁeld avenue, early yes-
terday morning by an intruder who
was driven away by the screams of
one of the girls living in the house.

R-ebecca Nay, C41, discovered the
burglar when she put on a light at
4 o’clock in the morning, after hear-
ing a sound in one of the adjoin-
ing rooms. Her shouts awakened the
other occupants of the house and
caused the unidentified Negro in-
truder to leave through the bed-
room window.

A jimmied window in the back
of the house was the means of en-
trance of the burglar who was mak-
ing a systematic room-by-room
looting of valuables.

SFA Revision
To Be. Killed

This Evening

Observers Predict
Evasion of Issue
By S. F. AYERS

Campus observers predict the leg-
islative death of the highly-touted
constitutional revision plan for the
Student-Faculty association this
evening on the twelfth ﬂoor some-

time after 8 o’clock.

Three courses lie open to the stu-
dent—faculty group this evening
when it meets to consider the pro-
posals of David Tucker, C41, vice-
president of SFA and chairman of
the committee. The plan may be

(3

‘defeated, tabled, or put before the

geheral student body for approval
or rejection at an election.

Party Leaders

Leaders of both parties seem to
favor a plebiscite on the plan, hop-
ing that their representatives in
SFA will not have to bear the brunt
of the decision regarding this com-
plete upheaval in the composition
of the assembly and executive com-
mittee, or bear the embarrassment
of voting themselves out of ofﬁce.

Indications are that the members
of both the fraternity and independ-
ent parties are on each side of the
fence in regard to the plan, although
it is claimed by independent lead-
ers that the fraternity men will vote
as a body against the measure to-
night.

Main innovation of the proposal
is the representation of activities
per se. Each fundamental group of
activities (music, publications, etc.)
would be entitled to a certain num-
ber of representatives in the stu-
dent-faculty council, with officers
selected by the student body in :5.
general election.

Frats, Non-Frats

Both fraternity and independent
leaders agree that something is
wrong with the present set—up.
They are, however, unwilling to be-
gin a new plan hurriedly, especially
at a time so close to election.

One independent leader summed
up his opinion on the plan in this
way: “I would support the pro-
posal if I were sure that it would
allow student government to do
more than under the present set-
up. I am against any plan which
would put control of student gov-
ernment entirely into the hands of
the activities to the neglect and
detriment of the great mass of stu-
dents who are not in activities. If
I am satisfied on thes two points,
I will vote for the proposal; other-
wise I will vote against it.”

ROBERT R. CORLEY

“graduate” after four years

Corlcy eaves
University Post

Assistant Dean Joins

Irvin ‘Works Staff

Robert R. Corley, assistant dean
of men, will resign April 1 to as-
sume a position in the personnel
department of the Irvin works of
the Carnegie-Illinois Steel corpor-
ation.

Succeeding N. Robert Seidle in
October 1936, Corley has been in
charge of fraternities, Spring Fes-
tival, cooperative buying, and has
been adviser to Interfraternity
council, Phi Eta Sigma, and Men’s
council.

A graduate of Bethany college
in the class of 1932, Corley received
his MA degree from the University
in 1934. He is a member of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, Scabbard and
Blade, Phi Eta Sigma, Druids, and
Sigma Nu.

Corley’s resignation is the third
among the faculty and administra-
tion in as many weeks. H. H. Roth-
rock, professor and head of the de-
partment of mechanical engineer-
ing, who also will join Carnegie-
Illinois, and Gene Burkhart, acting
secretary of the General Alumni‘
association and editor of the Alumni
Review, resigned their positions at
the University recently.

It  not expected that a succes-
sor will be appointed to ﬁll the va-
cancy caused by the resignation
until after the end of the present
semester.

Corley made the following state-
ment Monday when he announced
that his resignation was forthcom-
mg:

“I enjoyed my stay here at the
University very much and have
had a great deal of pleasure from
my work among the students. I
have proﬁted a great deal through
my contacts with the students. It
has been an extremely good four
years.”

Commenting upon the resigna-
tion of his assistant, Dr. Vincent
W‘. Lanfear, dean of men, declared:

“I am sorry to see Mr. Corley
leave the University, for he has
been a hard-working and sympa-
thetic adviser to those organiza-
tions for which he has been re-
sponsible. All oi‘ us in this office
wish him the best success in his
new position.”

Jarrett Exhibits Ph.otographic IVorks
In Seventh Floor Galleries for Two ‘Macks

Thomas M. Jarrett, University
photographer and photographic
technician of the ﬁne arts depart-
ment, last Monday stepped out of
his role as an employee of the
school and moved into the spotlight
on his own when he exhibited his
photographs in the seventh floor
galleries. _

Jarrett has been taking photo-
graphs for 35 years. His father
before him was one of the ﬁrst por-
trait photographers in Pittsburgh;
he photographed the most promi-
nent people in Pittsburgh. Child
portraits were his specialty.

Before coming to the University,
Jarrett worked with his father for
25 years. He also tested photo-
graphing paper for a chemical sup-

ply company.

In 1928 he came to the University
as photographic technician for the
fine arts department.

He has been at various times a
contributing member to 150 pho-
tographic salons all over the world.
Among his souvenirs are certiﬁ-
cates of merit from professional
photographers’ conventions, and
trophies and cups for prize-winning
pictures.

Many of the pictures in the pres-
ent exhibit, now on view, have won
all kinds of honors.

There are pictures of babies, foot-
ball players, dogs, tennis stars,
scenes about the campus and the
Cathedral, and’ many others.

Jarrett does all kinds of pho-
tographic work, architectural, com-

mercial, artistic, portraiture, and
color work. He likes color-work
particularly, because it affords wi-
der means of expression.

‘ His photographs are familiar to
readers of campus publications.
Some of his best work has been
done for “Pitt,” the magazine edi-
ted by Agnes Lynch Starrett, the
sharpness of his pictures taking

well to the offset technique employ-'

ed by the magazine. .
Jarrett maintains his ofﬁces o
the eighth floor, near the dean of

men's office. - '

The best products of his Jarrett’s
camera art have been chosen and
arranged for display in the seventh
ﬂoor galleries.
' The exhibit will continue through
April 5.

Science and Sooiet ':
The Fruits of Labor

WE KNOW NOT for what personal reasons
Dr. Charles G. King, professor of chemistry,
turned over to the Universitj,', for research
funds, the patent rights for his and the late Dr.
‘William Waugh’s method of isolating vitamin C.

We care not. The action speaks for itself.

From a purely theoretical point of view a
teaching scientist, a research scientist, has in-
terested himself in the social consequences of
his work. What might have been his own legit-
imate income wiil now further the progress of
science.

Dr. Kings action is not the usual action of
the company scientist, whose work, perforce, is
the property of the corporation, which uses only
a slight portion of the resulting patent income to
further research-——and this for more income.

But Dr. King is turning his patent, not the
University’s, back into the University, back into
more research for more social progress—not for
more economic gain.

In appreciation, speaking for the University
and the society which beneﬁts from vitamin C
and the yet—to-come research, we humbly thank
Charles Glenn King.

Preparedness Notes
OBy Rugy Aldisert

I had read and heard an awful lot about the army
expansion, but I never appreciated the dramatic
hugeness of the military training program until we
unexpectedly bumped into the United States army at
work almost every day during the trip south.

-Although we had charted dozens of sightseeing
spots for our’ 3500-mile tour, we made no provisions
for military scenes. Maybe this was the reason I was
so impressed by the swaggering MP’s patrolling the
country town streets of New Cumberland, reception
center for Pennsylvania draftees, and by the yellow
low-slung barracks skirting the Harrisburg airport to
accommodate men from the state’s National Guard
airforce.

Convoy Through Maryland

Then there was that highway in Maryland where
we got tangled up in an army convoy of trucks whiz-
zing down from New Hampshire on their way to some
fort in Florida. Equipped with their own traffic oili-
cers, led by station wagon-riding officers, these con-
voys really clipped along in American blitz style.

The next day we were heading into Montgomery,
Ala. (Remember this town? It was the capital of the
Confederacy), when one of the lads counted 43 bomb-
ers and pursuit ships playing air games over Maxwell
ﬁeld, one of the South’s many army training stations.
Surprisingly enough this airport wasn’t boarded up.
It was surrounded by ordinary cyclone fence ‘through
which anyone could take pictures and through which
anyone could see the gnarled aluminum remains of
recent crack—ups.

Port of New Orleans

In New Orleans we took a harbor ride one day on
one of the Streckfus line’s stern paddlers (We had
to check our cameras) and saw how near—war-
time conditions affect American ports. There was,
for example, a freighter bearing the name of its home
port Oslo, devoid of all life but a ﬂuttering ﬂag of
Norway. Further down the harbor, loading supplies,
was an Canadian merchantman, sporting covered guns
aft and forward. Riding at anchor in mid-harbor
were four freighters—two from England and two
ﬂying the Italian colors. The British ships were wait-
ing their turn at the docks, explained the lecturer on
our steamer. Mussolini’s boats, he said, had been
loaﬁng there since last May.

But it was in the mountains of Kentucky, at bullion-
famous Fort Knox, that we encountered the most
gigantic demonstration of U. S. preparedness. Our
introduction to this came when a squadron of army
cyclists whizzed by us, closely followed by three light
tanks smoking along at more than 45 miles-per-hour.

Old Gold and New Barracks

Entrance to the fort proper was guarded by white-
leggined MP’s directing traffic past generous homes
for Colonels and Lt. Col’s to the parade grounds and
the garages and the yellow pine barracks which make
up the country’s largest center for American mechan-
ized forces. Private contractors and WPA workers-
about 800 strong—were hammering up row after row
of barracks to house the thousands of new draftees
now waiting at Meade, New Cumberland, and Fort
Benjamin Harrison to be transferred here.

Then we rolled into Pittsburgh. There we saw the
University marshals. They had blue coats.

Take Southern hospitality.

It was the second time I’d ever been considerably
below the Mason Dixon line, and now I feel expertly
in condition to debunk that talked-up. Southern in-
stitution.

We got as far as Lexing-
ton, Va., on the way down.
and so we decided to see if
the movie sets for Brother
Rat of a few years back
were authentic. So we ups
to VMI, that celebrated
West Point of the South.
We drove up the hill, got
out of the car, looked up toward a parapet, and some
bird growled behind our backs, “We don’t have any
fraternities, here, boys.” I guess he thought we were
a bunch of college bummers. Imagine that.

So then we walks into the courtyard to see the
snazzy uniforms, and some guy in a confederate blue-
gray ankle-length (that’s the thing this season at
VMI) overcoat bellows “Sorry, but y’a1l hafta move
on. Y’all cain’t be heah now!”

So we spat over a parapet and rolled deeper into
the South. VMI certainly was heard from that day,
to nauseaphrase.

And after I got down to Baton Rouge, and I mean
that’s really deep in the South, I had a blind date.
Aside from the fact that
blind dates in my case al-
ways gyp the girls, blind
dates are ﬁne. And in spite
of the fact that someone
mixed up my application
blank by writing “Yes: 2
feet 5, I'm a midget” I
came out in ﬁne shape with
a little southern nifty in seven yards of black taffeta
and four starched petticoats.

So I got myself set for a nice dance evening, ex-
pecting and accepting that Southern jumping stuff. I
extends my stalwart Yankee arm (she liked Yankees)
and marched onto the ﬂoor. I takes a step and a half
of my one-two-three, and some rebel boy pokes me
on the shoulder. I didn't see my gal until intermis-
sion.

I fed her a coke at intermission, and tried to mas-
ter the system by cutting in 20 times in 15 minutes.
The betting was 5 to 1 she’d have broken ribs the way

JoyRide South-
No Life So Happy?

By Irving Kaufman

It looks like it’s going to take more than a pre-
paredness program to pull the South out of its economic
doldrums. Army camps, with their comparatively

well-heeled soldiery, are shooting up in the South, but
the new defense factories, with their aspects of per-
manency, are being sown above the Mason-Dixon line.
So much we observed from talking with Southerners
and from reading Southern papers whose only unan-
imity of purpose and outlook is in the wailing about
defense factories and how the South is getting bilked.

However, when an occasional factory does hit the
South, things happen. We checked into Pulaski, Va..
about dinner time, went into a half-ﬁnished restaurant,
and tried to get a dinner. We had to wait an hour,
but we learned that a new Hercules powder plant had
caused the town to be jammed with locals and transient
Southerners who were working on the job and com-
plaining about high rents and low accommodations.
Pulaski is one lively town today.

But the Southern community without a defense job
seems as if it were waiting either for a relief check
or the resurgence of the Confederacy or both. We
drove through innumerable Southern towns and vi!-
lages, and without exception the sidewalks of the
main drag were lined with whites and blacks who
might have been talking about the war or the derby,
but they sure wcren’t working. Most of these towns
have a very high relief content, and mark time from
season to season, until the surrounding farmers get a
little dough, either from the government or from the
beautiful but near-sterile red earth which really does
exist outside of GWTW.

Farming in the South seems to rely a lot on mule-
power. You see the real—life Tobacco Road shanties
lining the modern highways, and you see the il1—clad
farmer, slowly cutting his few acres into red ribbons,
as he does his early plowing. You see his kids, who
ought to be in school, but aren’t, lolling around the
shack; and overhead you see the high tension wires
that carry the electricity from some new dam site
like Tallulah falls. From what we saw, rural electri-
ﬁcation may be a great thing, but as yet it hasn’t hit
the tenant farmer and share—cropper. It’s a rather
incongruous sight, this eighteenth century crudeness
and twentieth century efficiency existing side by side,
each apparently ignorant of the other’s presence.

.The muniﬁcent hand of the government seems more
in evidence in the South than up here in Yankeeland.
If it’s not a new stone courthouse, or postofﬁce for
some other-wise bedraggled county seat, it’s the new
PWA highways that cut through the hills for the con-
venience of the mules and occasional traveler. If it’s
not the highways, it’s the erosion control projects
which seem to be doing very little healing on the huge,
deep, and ragged red scars which often pass for South-
ern farm-lands.

To and from the South, we did, among other things,
take pains to talk to as many Southerners as could
be reasonably understood by us and vice-versa. These
people, store-keepers, TVA public relations men,
waitresses, students, like to talk about the South’s
economic future. From these talks, we gathered that
the trend is away from cotton ;down with cotton and
up_ with manufacturing, and the new staple crop,
quick-growing Southern pine. To get manufacturers,
the South has been raiding the North by giving land,
little or no taxes, sometimes the building, and prornis-
mg cheap labor. The result is seen every once in a
while in a new brick factory which seems to be for
textiles. The result is seen on the road now and then
by truckloads of textile machinery heading south.
Concerning the pine, it grows everywhere in the South,
and it is being used more and more for a cheap, quick
growing crop.

But from what we saw, nine-year pine, renegade
northern textile mills, and preparedness will not bring
economic prosperity to the South. What is needed
is money. Money, they say down there, and plenty
of it. The South doesn’t have it, the North won’t in-
vest it, and the only one left is the government. Well,
the government has been pouring it into the South,
but a lot more will have to go into highways. elcctri;
ﬁcatlon, and private subsidies before the South can
emerge from its economic vassalage.

Gallup Poll, Editors Blame Defense Production
Slow-Up on Labor, But They Forget to Use Facts

. By EDGAR BEIGEL

Last Sunday Dr. Gallup‘s de-
fense poll was published. The
question was: “Do you think

America’s production of arms, air-
planes, and other war materials is
going ahead fast enough?” The
point seemed harmless, merely one
of determining to what extent the
American newspaper and radio had
affected the people by their stories
on the defense program.

For some, the real purpose of the
question seems to have been an-
other point. The Pittsburgh Press,
local Gallup outlet, editorialized:
“Regardless of explanations and at-
tempts to belittle the number of
workers on strikes, it is becoming

formulated a theory on marriage:
“It’s just like graduation; you lose
your Bachelor's degree to acquire

increasingly evident that the whole
defense program has been slowed
down . . . by s.oppage of work in
key factories . . .

0 Bad, Bad Labor Leaders

“The United States has become
suspicious of labor leaders. It is
deeply concerned over defense
strikes. This concern is the fore-
runner of action. The way to pre-
vent that action is for the respon-
sible leaders to come to their senses
before it is too late.” The Press of-
fers no further information other
than that many of the strikes are
“trivial, jurisdictional, or outlaw.”

We, in turn, “are a li‘tle suspici-
ous” of Dr. Ga1lup’s succinctly-
phrased query and the resulting
presentation. The answers to Gal-
lup’s questions were:

Satisﬁed, 30 per cent; Dissatis-
ﬁed, 53 per cent; No opinion, 17
per cent. Of those dissatisﬁed, 52
per cent blamed it on strikes, 11
per cent on government, 9 per cent
on labor or material shortage, 5
per cent on lack of organization,
5 per cent on sabotage and proﬁt-
seeking businessmen, 6 per cent on
lack of public interest and other
reasons. Twelve per cent had no
opinion.

Obissatisfaction as Strikes

At a glance this poll would make
a majority of the American people
appear to be deﬁnitely dissatisﬁed
with the defense program and a
majority placing blame upon “la-
bor strikes.” Evidently such in-
terpretation ﬁtted the preconceived
Press policy. But the same ﬁgures
can be listed to show another re-
sult:

Thirty per cent think the de-
fense program is progressing ok;
27.5 per cent think strikes are
slowing down defense; 23.5 per cent
have no opinion; 19 per cent think
defense is being slowed down for
some other reason.

Thus strikes can be statistically
minimized as well as exaggerated.
It is also conceivable that newspa-
pers could stress that the poll re-
vealing what people think is hap-
pening has nothing to do with what
is happening. Editorially some
correlation could be suggested be-
tween the 1940 net proﬁts of the 900
largest corporations and the extent
of labor controversy (usually de--
mands for higher wages, according
to the newspapers) arising in those
corporations.

‘O The Tone of News

The Press could have suggested
that the Gallup results were logical,
since the tone of the news during
the past six months has created an
uneasiness and uncertainty among
most of the people about the de-
fense program, and has offered--de-

spite the great American bylines—-
no clariﬁcation, except to headline
strike stories.

We would completely disregard
the Gallup poll and its presenta-
tion except for two apparent facts:
(1) most people accept Gallup as
fact, not opinion; (2) many people
take the defense program seriously.
If the Press is serious, why doesn’t
it name the labor leader in each
speciﬁc strike, clearly point out
the issue involved, and how the
defense program is affected, in-
stead of racing through the office
shouting “they better come to their
senses or we will take action!”
Why doesn’t the Press explain just
what makes “sense” to its editors?

We remember Senator Taft’s re-
action to the report that labor lead-
ers are gaining prominence in the
British cabinet: “My God! Do we
have to ﬁght them, too?”

Electricals Battle Independents
In Intramural Basketball Finals

Intraniural's last basketball game of the season will be played
tonight at 8 o’clock in the Trees gym when the engineering league
champions, the Electricals. battle the favored independent circuit
titleholder, the Independents, in the ﬁnals of the all-campus playoffs.

Caution will be thrown to the winds tonight. for victory to

either squad means the much sought after elinnipionship cup.

Delts, Fijis Win
Table Tennis,
VolleyballTitles

Clearing the decks for the com-
ing softball season, the fraternity
volley ball and table tennis leagues
brought their schedules to a close
last week. When the ﬁnal tabula-
tions were in, they showed the Phi
Gams as the volleyball kings and

the Delts as the table tennis
champs.
The Fiji sextet, composed of

“Stoney” Bitner, Walt Uptegraif,
Al Holbrook, Bill Mansﬁeld, Jim
Wame, and Paul McNeil, played
brilliantly throughout the current
campaign and lost only three games
while winning thirty-three for a
percentage of .916.

Playing nearly as brilliantly and
giving the Fijis a good run for the
crown, the PiKA six ﬁnished a
good second with thirty wins out
of thirty-six games. Tom Stephen-
son, Frank Mateer, Marshall Mor-
gan, Barney Runk, “Chuck” Page,
and Dick Henry helped the Belle-
ﬁeld avenuers take the place spot
out of thirteen positions.

The table tennis ﬁght was even
hotter than the one for the volley-
ball crown with only a ﬁve game
difference between the winning
Delt team and the second place
SAM four. Dan Cannon, Bill Kra-
mer, Harris Hawkins, and Bill
Riddle were able to come from be-
hind for the Delts and knock the
SAM team out of ﬁrst place near
the end of the race. Harold Davis,
Norm Sapolsky, Henry Nemrod,
and Sig Edelmian gave a good dis-
play of table tennis excellence,
even though they were vanquished
in the end.

eon will be held between 12:30 and

Due
to their impressive record of twelve
wins and one defeat, the Indepen-
dents must be named favorites, but
the surprising engineering quintet
has pulled upsets all season and
may do it again.

In the opening round of the in-
tramural playoffs, the fraternity
hopefuls lost to the independent
team by a close margin of two
points. Then the Electricals
matched this victory in eliminat-
ing the powerful Sammie team by
the identical margin of two points.
This should go a long way toward
proving the equal merits of both
champions.

The boys from Thaw hall play
more of a defensive game than do
their opponents. Their games have
been characterized by low, close
scores. In quite a few games dur-
ing the regulation season, the cup
bearers were underdogs before the
game, only to emerge victorious.

Rudy Tratar, forward on the
Electrical team, has been the high
point man all year. His all-around
play has stamped him as a danger-
ous man to be opposing. Shuber,
Bilowish, Kindelberger, and Steibel
are the ‘bther four virtually un-
knowns who helped Tratar lead
them to the title.

In contrast to the good ﬁeld, no
hit quintet of the Electricals is the
fast breaking, high scoring com-
bination of the Independents.

The Independents won their
league crown going away. Their
only competition was from the me-
diocre Big Five team, vwho ﬁnished
in second place, and a poor resem-
blance to last year’s championship
quintet, the Valley Boys.

Edgar Jones, who seemingly took
a step upward from the fraternity
ranks, led his independent team-
mates in every contest. His accu-
rate shooting and his ability to keep
the team together made him a can-
didate for the all-intramural team.

At the forward posts tonight will
be Williams and Kuzman, at the
guard positions will be “Dusty”
Rhoades and either Bill Dutton or
Ralph Fife.

Electricals Trounce

Greek Titleholders

Turning on the “juice” in the
last quarter, a ﬁghting Electrical
quintet upset the Sammies, 27-25,
in the second round of the intra-
mural championship playoff last
Friday.

This was the second defeat for

the “pride of the Greeks” and elim-

inates them from competing fur-
ther in the championship battles.

For three quarters it looked as
though the Sammies would win,
but during the last quarter Kindle-
berger and Shuber began to hit
the hoop, and in the last few sec-
onds Shuber dropped in the one
that was to be the margin of vic-
tory.

Leading the Electrical team, one
which couldn’t place a single man
on the all-intramural team, were
Kindleberger and Shuber with four
ﬁeld goals and a foul apiece.

Top man for the Sammies was
Hack White with four ﬁeld goals;
following him were Hurwitz with
ﬁve points and Mayer and Abrom-
ovitz with four points apiece.

CLAIR MALARKEY--In a year
during which seniors dominated the
Pitt basketball picture almost ex-

clusively, Tay Malarkey was the
shining light among the sophomores
on the squad. When Tay was at
his peak, the Panthers won.

The Bridgeville boy was a
WPIAL standout and played bril-
liantly as a Pitt freshman. As a
member of the Varsity, he spent the
season alternating with Larry Pati-
rath as the number one Panther re-
serve.

After playing ﬁne ball most of
the year, Tay was called home to
Bridgeville at the close of the ﬁrst
semester when his father died.
Consequently, he missed his ﬁnals,
and was ineligible for further com-
petition until he made them up
about a week and a half ago.

Came last Friday evening and
the NCAA quarter-ﬁnals, Malarkey
got in as a sub. With his appear-
ance on the floor, the Panthers
started to roll. Malarkey whipped
in three ﬁeld goals, one foul, for
seven points, one more than the

Pitt margin over North Carolina,
26-20.

Grady Honors
Herb Cosgrove

Herb Cosgi-ore heads for Kansas
City this Friday and Saturday as
Pitt’s lone delegate to the National
Collegiate Swimming association
championships. Entered as the
Eastern Collegiate breaststroke
champions, Cosgrove will be com-
pcting against the cream of the
aquatic crop.

Most of the Big Ten teams will
have representatives at the Nation-
al festivities. As usual, Michigan
is favored to cop top honors. Matt
Mann coaches more current Na-
tional champions than all of the
other schools collectively.

Ohio State, Iowa, Yale, Rutgers,
Princeton, and Wayne are the
schools expected to threaten the
Wolverines aquatic supremacy.
West Coast schools have neither
declined or decided to enter the
National Collegiate festivities as
yet.

Considering the present records
of the various swimmers entered in
the meet, Michigan, Yale, and
Wayne university will probably
ﬁnish one, two, three in the Na-
tional tussles. But if Stanford and
Southern California from the West
Coast circuit enter into competi-
tion, the results may tell a different
story.

Panther Marksmen Drill
For Intercollegiate Tilts

Culminating the regular varsity
season, the ride team journeys to
Washington, D. 0, Friday to take
part in the National Intercollegiate
matches Saturday.

Four regulars will deﬁnitely
make the trips and four others are
ﬁghting this week to fill the other
two positions. Barney Cengia, Bill
Shuck, Vic Kelly, and Jack Helb-
ling, who placed first in last week’s
postal matches, will compete until
Wednesday before the ﬁnal choices
will be made.

Riﬂe Team Optimistic

Captain Jim Townsend, Larry

Laspada, Gerry Haywood, and Joe

Bowling

Coming back after their defeat at
the hands of the Amity club, the
Pi Lambda Phi team took two
straight from the Industrials, engi-
neering league champ, last Monday
to eliminate the engineers and place
themselves in the ﬁnal round of
the bowling playoffs.

The second match of the after-
noon saw the Pilams hit the high
score of 803 as Al Gross knocked
over 218 pins.

The ﬁnals between the Pilams
and the Amity club will be held
today at 4:30.

Weisman, who just returned to the
ranks of the eligibles, will be ex-
pected to carry most of the load
for the Panthers.

Last year a highly touted team
disappointed as they placed only
ninth. This year’s team, under
a new coaching regime, looks as
though it is capable of causing a
furor if key men are on.

Larry LaSpada gives Pitt its
hope of copping individual honors,
but he will be hard pressed by the
best marksmen in the country.

Results received from the third
corps area headquarters reveal that
Pitt’s ﬁrst ROTC team placed
eighth in the William Randolph

Hearst Trophy match with a team
score of 909. Lehigh ended ﬁrst
with 943.

Weisman Shoots 188

Penn State, with 930, and VPI
also with 930, took the runner-up
positions. Pennsylvania took indi-
vidual honors with a 199 out of
200.

Joe Weisman was high man for
Pitt with a 188. The Panther sec-
ond stringers were ﬁve notches
lower than the ﬁrst squad and two
above Tech’s ﬁrst team. As a mat-
ter of fact, the Skibo’s ﬁrst team
was ﬁve places below its second
team, which placed tenth.

U. S. Requires
Meteorologists
F or Defense

An urgent need for meteorologists
in the National Defense program
of the United States was revealed
in a letter, to Donald C. Bradford,
University seismologist, from the
Civil Service commission.

Duties involved in the meteorol-
ogist positions include planning,
supervising, and conducting inves-
tigations or research work i.n the
special branch of meteorolog in
which the appointment is made. The
salaries for these positions range
from $2,500 to $5,600 a year.

Applicants must have completed
a four year college course with ma-
jor study in meteorology, physics,
engineering, astronomy, geology,
mathematics, or any other closely
related subjects. In addition they
must have had responsible profes-
sional experience in meteorology.

“This is an opportunity for the
colleges to do something worth
while in the defense program,” says
Bradford, “there is a large and ex-
panding ﬁeld here for students who
are interested.”

Any qualiﬁed person who is in-
terested should apply to Bradford
in 428 Cathedral for additional in-
formation on the subject. Examin-
ation announcements, containing
further details, will be available
at this time.

Amity Elects,
Plans Socials

Amity ' club, social organization,
has become active once more on
campus and has formulated plans
for novel social and athletic func-
tions for the coming spring, an-
nounces Edward Byers, C43, presi-
dent.

Members of the club will meet at
1 o’clock today in 206 Cathedral
to discuss plans for a party to be
held Saturday.

Byers described the newly re-
vived club as “living up to its rep-
utation in having at least one social
affair a week.”

~ “The aim of the club,” said By-
ers, “is to provide low-cost, good
times for all students, especially
those not in fraternities, who other-
wise have no opportunity outside of
regular school dances, to get to-
gether socially.”

Amity club plans to sponsor
teams in all intramural sports and
to bring well-known speakers to
address its members at the Various
meetings.

Other plans include an informal
spring dance open to all students, a
barn dance, a hayrid , a swimming
party, and a picnic.

“Although members usually con-
tribute for each social even,” said
Byers. “the club has decided on
minimum weekly dues.”

Officers of this year’s club are:
Emil DeLeo, E41, vice president;
Ed Murphy, BA42, secretary; and
Al Norbut, BA42, treasurer.

Society Offers
ROTC Award

A new medal, awarded by the
Sons of the American Revolution,
will be presented to the ROTC stu-
dent who is most outstanding in
respect to leadership, soldierly
bearing, and in the theoretical mil-
itary courses.

Although the national society
w‘th ‘headquarters located in Wash-
ington, D. C., has been awarding
the medals for some time in cer-
tain parts of the country through
various chapters, the idea was only
adopted recently by the Pittsburgh
chapter. -- I ‘

Under the tentative proposals,
yearly medals will be given ‘to
each of the three cclleges in the
city having ROTC.uriits.

It is thought that the command-
ant at each school will‘ have the
authority to make the award, since
no speciﬁc requirements are set
up. .

The proposal that an award be
given this year was made at the
recent meeting of the Pittsburgh
chapter of the Sons of the Ameri-
can Revolution in Hotel Henry last
Wednesday.

Prominent members of the Pitts-

burgh chapter are: Harbaugh Mil-
ler, president, who is president of
the General Alumni association;
Dr. Charles B. Shaler, vice—presi—
dent of the chapter and a Pitt
graduate; D. W. Rial, :tate historian
of the chapter and a University
graduate; and Dr. John G. Bow-
man, chancellor of the University,
who is a member of the Patriotic
Education committee of the chap-
ter.

No lilore . . .

tickets are available for the Mil-
itary ball announces George Ma-
ruschak, C41, chairman of the
Military ball committee, in re-
sponse to numerous and insistent
inquires.

they maintain that Dr. Perrine is
both clever and. humorous in his
presentation.

Dr. Perrine will discuss the
speech sounds and their basic ele-
ments, and the electrical means of
creating speech-like sounds, as he
will tell of the apparatus which
may develop into another major
step in the art and science of tele-
phony.

The pitch of sound production
from the Voder can be varied at
will. The ensemble can be made
to speak in a basso profundo voice,
a high pitched voice, the shaky
voice of an old man, and it can pro-
duce laughter and singing.

Two kinds of sound used in hu-
man speech can be produced by

0n ‘Both-Button Pushers’

Old chestnuts such as “Life is
just a series of ups and downs for
you fellows, isn’t it?” are the things
that make the elevator operator's
job a trying one.

Clint Thornburg, elevator oper-
ator and student in national defense
courses, used to be annoyed at this
and other disturbances. A well-
meaning person, however, sent him
an anonymous limerick deploring
his grumpiness. Thereafter Clint
adopted a cheerful philosophy to-
ward his numerous and assorted
passengers.

Now there are no disliked pas-
sengers. There are, however, fav-

the Voder. One kind is" made by
forcing the breath through the
mouth, past the tongue,‘ teeth, and
lips while shaping the mouth cav-
ity. Unvoiced consonant sounds
like “s” and “h" are made in this
way.

Also produced by the Voder are
the sounds of human speech which
come from the vocal chords, such
as the vowels of “a,” “o,” and “u.”

The practical signiﬁcance of the
apparatus, not deﬁnitely establish-
ed at present, is the possibility of
having words spoken into a tele-
phone convcrted into narrow bands
of frequency stimulating telegraph
signals. The signals at the end of
the line will control electrical cur-
rents to recreate the words of the
speaker.

orites such as Blossom L. Henry,
assistant professor of modern lan-
guages. and Frank W. Shockley,
director of the Extension division.

Many assorted questions try the
patience of the operators. Many
riders want to see the panel for
emergency exits and want to know
how it works.

The usual answer to the question,
“How many times do you come
down a day?” is “Just as many
times as we go up.” But one day
Clint counted the trips on a fast
day in an express elevator. He
made 121 trips.

The worst thing. it seems, that
can be done to annoy an operator is
to push both the up and the down
buttons at the same time. This
automatically stops the elevator
twice for the same passenger.

Incidentally Clint denies that all
people who want off at the ﬁfth
ﬂoor are found in the back of the
elevator. That’s the one point we
questioned him on.

A good way to get the most out

ice-cold Coca-Cola. Its taste is
delicious. Its ufter—sense of re-

the refreshing thing to do. So
