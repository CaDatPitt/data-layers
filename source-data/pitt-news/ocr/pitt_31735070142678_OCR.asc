University to oppose Ravenstahl tax

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt announced yesterday that it op-
poses the mayor’s newest proposal to
tax college students.

The University said inastatement
that it would oppose any attempt to
tax its students, citing its current com-
mitments to the community and its
support of the city’s government.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s 2010
budget proposal includes a provision
that would charge students 1 percent
of their tuition — $135 for in—state

students in Pitt’s School of Arts &

Sciences — to help ﬁll a $15 million ‘

hole in the city budget. Under the Act
47 Recovery Plan, Pittsburgh has to
increase contributions to the city’s
ailing pension fund, according to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Before the mayoral election, Ra-
venstahl proposedaﬂat $100 fee onall
college students per year, as well as fees
onhospital bills, to raisethe additional
revenue. The currentproposal—“The
Fair Share Tax”—wouldtaxCarnegie
Mellon students $400 per year, ac-
cording to the Post—Gazette.

Aiteritwas proposed, the Univer-

sitysaid on Oct.12itwouldoppose any
effortto“direct1yorindirectlyalterthe
tax—exempt status of the University.”

Pitt mentioned its contributions
to the ﬁrst Pittsburgh Public Service
Fund, a group of non—proﬁt organi-
zations that voluntarily contributed
funds to the city. The organizations
contributed more than $14 million
during2005,2006 and 2007, accord-
ing to Pitt’s statement.

The statement said the Pittsburgh
City Council has not yet approved a
new Pittsburgh Public Service Ftmd
fortheyears of2008, 2009 and2010.
Pitt feels that the fund is the “most

efﬁcient and effective” way for it to
contribute to the community, the
statement said.

Pitt increased its ﬁnancial pledge
to the newest fund, according to the
statement. The statement also men-
tioned various taxes currently paid
to the city, such as for parking, non-
educational property and “amusement
taxes,” as well as Pitt police’s support
of the community. . _

Mayor Ravenstahl’s ofﬁce did not
respond to three phone calls request-
ing comment. Pitt spokesman John
Harvith said Pittwould not comment
ﬁirther on the situation.

Harper left

11 it took was one visit

to Africa for the desire

to help others to take
control of her.

Imani Harper, a junior on the
Pitt women’s volleyball team, has
always had a heart for the world
—-— and she doesn’t want to stop
helping when she graduates.

“I’ve always viewed the world
differently than everyone else,”
she said. “It was never just
within Pittsburgh or even the
United States. I always viewed it
as the world in general.”

Harper visited Senegal with
her grandmother and mother
after her sophomore year of high
school. While there, she visited
an orphanage. She admits her
preset idea of an orphanage co-
incided more with “Oliver Twist”
than anything else.

“I was almost in tears on the
way there because I said, ‘I don’t
want to see sad kids, I don’t want
to do this,”’ Harper said.

When she arrived, however,
she saw that the kids loved life.
They played and smiled when
they saw her.

“That’s what made me appre- ‘

ciate why they were there,” she
said. “I went on to thinking that
it’s something cool, that kids are
given up every day and this is a
place for them to grow up.”
Harper said all these factors
contribute to her goal in life. She
wants to work with orphans in

University oﬂicials said they’ve been able to ﬁnd
temporary housing for 31 students who were dis-
placed in a ﬁre in the Centre Plaza Apartments
thisweekend. '
The night oftheﬁne, Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele
said he thought that 12 students were displaced.

The rest of the students, he said, decided to ﬁnd
altemative places to stay on their own.

Fedele’s statement contradicted accounts given
this weekend by sophomore Kasey Peart.

Students curious about life in car

Cars 4 2

The group’s campaign for the Insight, “Get
Further,” is aimed at Generation Y — people
born in the 1980s and 1990s. They built the
campaign around the idea that Insight driv-

ers can get farther with the model because

of the hybrid vehicle’s fuel economy.

The class came up with the idea of taking
it bit ﬁirther by suggesting one could live
in the car. .

Lerch, Piccora andjohnson rolled down
their windows to show that the car was fairly
empty. Piccora sat in the backseat with a
laptop with a visitor. Lerch 'and_]ohnson were
in the front with some snacks.

They kept all their other possessions in
the second Insight, which they used for extra
storage. '

Johnson said they needed all the room
they could get to sleep comfortably in one
car. -

“Our huge muscles take up a lot volume,”
he said. 0

At night, they morphed the car for a more
suitable sleeping conﬁguration by folding
down the back seats for a spacious suite

‘in the rear..Piccora, at 6—foot—1, occupied

the space because he is the shortest of the
three.
Lerch, who is an inch taller, reclined in

the passenger’s seat withjohnson, 6—foot-3,
in the driver’s seat. '
Johnson suggested that others who at-
tempt to live in the Insight avoid sleeping
near the steering wheel. It presents a bit of
an obstacle, he said.
The group’s ﬁrst night in the car was fairly

\

here,” Lerch joked.

The only time they have left the Insight,
they said, is to hit up the restrooms. The
three decided to skip the rest of theirclasses
to live in the car. - .

the Insight with video footage and through

Ravenstahl jumps on
student apathy at polls

, he polls were empty on Nov. 3.
I Selectingamayor did not inter-

est many students, as electronic
ballot boxes sat unused. Only tumble-
weedwas '

When students don’t vote, politi-
cians dorftwonyabouttargetingtheni.
Asthe adage goes, “Decisions are made
by those who show up.” In leaving the
polls unattended, college students im-
plicitly decided to allow Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl to formally propose his
student tax on Monday.

Ravenstahl calls the 1 percent tu-
ition tax the “Fair Share Act.” It would
levyamxofabout$135 peryearforeach
Pitt student, generating approximately
$16 million per year. '

He said, “We cannolongeraffordto

. provide city services to those who are

not paying theirfair share,” according
to the 'I‘ribune-Review. The mayor says
that students use the police force, the
ﬁre department, building inspection

and other city provisions without

compensation.

The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette re-
ported that the city turned down a
proposed $5.5 million donation from
the Pittsburgh Public Service Ftmd, of
which Pitt_is aparticipant. Presumably,
this voluntary donation was not a fair
share.

Nor was Pitt’s $3 million to fund
its own police force —- apart from the
city police services Ravenstahl says stu-
dentsuse— orthe current $45 million
paidincity andschooldistricttaxes, as
chronicled in the Post- Gazette.

The city would use $15 million of
the tax revenue to ﬁll a shortfall in city
worker pensions and the extra $1 mil-
lionto sustainthe ﬂoundering Carnegie
Library of Pittsburgh system. ’

For those of you playing along at
home, these are not the city services
the mayorthinks college students self-
ishly deplete.

The city needs help, but Pitt al-
ready contributes itsfairsharejustlast
month, Pittwas named the top public
schoolinthe nat1'onina“Saviors of our
Cities” survey, which ranked colleges’
contributions to their cities.

The University leads a plethora
of community service initiatives, and
its students usually provide the man-

, p0W€I'.

 UPMC is the largest
employer in Pennsylvania. Students

play a major role in sustaining micro-
economies throughout the city, the
most signiﬁcant being Oakland. Tens
of thousands of students ﬁmd these
rnicro—economies. They cause res-
taurants, cafes, boutiques and comer
shops to ﬂourish, allofwhich pay busi-
ness and property taxes. ’
Ravenstahl said the proposedtaxis
“less than one—tenth of what Council-
manPeduto pays inproperty andwage
taxes,” according to the Post-Gazette.
That is not a logical comparison, since
Peduto owns property and receives a

tax on income. Ifstudents work, they

pay income tax, too.

, Ifthe issue is property taxes, stu-
dents indirectly pay those, as well. If
they rent, landlords pay the taxes and
adjust monthly rent rates accord-

, The planis aform of reverse popu-
lismwhereinthe mayortakes advantage
of arecent stereotype thatPitt students

p gobble city resources, especially the
police force with regard to the G—2o
Summit and Super Bowl.

Unfortunately, the “Fair Share
Act” attempts to portray students as
privilegedfreeloaders. Gettingahigher
educationis aprivilege, but itis no'tre-

. served for a privileged class. Plenty of
stiidentsareﬁghtirigto payforthis self
betterment, and redundant, excessive
taxation only hinders their ability to

get educated. *

YetPittstudents mustshare much of
the blame forthis scenario. This iswhat
happens when students don’t become
politically active. The ward including

Oakland cast 1,889 ballots out of a
possible 17,570.Ata10.8 percentvoter
turnout, this was the second-lowest in
Allegheny County, only behind theward

° containing Dusquesne University.

Relatively speaking, Ravenstahl

. didn’t win this election by very much.

Ifstudentsvotedatthe same rateaslast
year’s presidential election, local politi-
cians like Ravenstahl would (are a lot
more about what they cared about.

Ravenstahl won, and six days after

' theelect1'on,heproposedﬂ1istax. Other_

taxes — for hospital stays and Down-
town parl<ing—— have beenwithheld.
Ravenstahl’s decision might work
because students didn’t show up. If
you didn’t vote, don’t complain about

Worsening situation in Afghanistan is the ultimate history test

 
   

Shane Levy
Columnist

In our history and social studies 7

classes, we learn that history tends
to repeat itself.

We study history so that we can
prevent past failures from recurring
and cultivate past successes’ even
further.

But with the recent news com-
ing from Afghanistan, I question
whether our leaders remember
those lessons from their social stud-
ies classes. .

Last Tuesday, eight more troops
were reported dead in Southern
Afghanistan, the region closest to
Pakistan.

Their deaths increased U.S. troop
casualties to 53 in October, making it
the deadliest month in the war yet.

Fifty—one troops died in Af-

ghanistan in the previous deadliest A

month, August.

Following such terrible newswas
the announcement that Matthew
Hoh, a leading ofﬁcial stationed in
Afghanistan, resigned his post.

Hoh, a Marine and former De-

partment of _Defense official in
Iraq, stated in his resignation let-

- ter, drafted on Sept. 10, that he had
' “lost understanding and conﬁdence

in the strategic purposes of the Unit-
ed States’ presence in Afghanistan”

and doubts the “current strategy -

and planned future strategy” in the
war. '

The history of Afghanistan —
and even neighboring Pakistan, for
that matter — has proven the coun-

to succeed.

In 1979, Soviet forces invaded
the country and -- with some help
from Uncle Sam — withdrew from

if Afghanistan 10 years later, unable

to maintain their control.

Foreign countries cannot suc-
cessﬁilly occupy Afghanistan. But
eight years after the initial U.S. inva-
sion of Afghanistan, and consider-
ing H_oh’s now public sentiments, it
still appears that our leaders don’t

is always going to take a political solution. You
cannot win in that country.”

But some senior American political ofﬁ-
cials, most notably President Obama, have
started entertaining the idea of supplying
more troops to the doomed region.

The  operations of the United States
inthe post-World War II era have been exhaus-
tive and generally lunsuccessﬁil campaigns.

The Korean War, Vietnam War, war in Iraq
and perhaps now even the war inAfghanistan
mostfrequently come to mind when one thinks
of modern American military failures.

The paramount example of American mili-'  ;
tary failure in the 20th century is arguably the * "

Vietnam War. ’
The Vietnam War, which cost 58,000
American troops their lives, was a campaign

built on unsubstantiated fears, and it was a 1

conﬂict for which the United States was ill-
prepared.

Recently, the war in Afghanistan has
been frequently compared to the Vietnam
War. From the unclear military strategy to the
insurgent enemy, Afghanistan and Vietnam
appear to be a match.

’ end in a stalem;_1t_ei,’_’i .

In March, however, thewar inAfghanistan
will surpass the length of the Vietnam War,
thus becoming the longest war in American
history. _

Vietnam and Afghanistan are on similar
paths. — '

With consistently rising casualties on both
the American and Afghan sides of the conflict,
and with no resolution of the war in sight,
perhaps Walter Cro'nkite’s legendary quote
about Vietnam might soon apply to Afghani-

stan: “-It seems now more certain than ever

that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to

 

An‘increase~in'ti‘oops in Afghanistan will
not solve the political and diplomatic problems
 haunt the region. Such a strategy ignores

1  long history of similar strategic failures in

Afghanistan, and it ignores similar circum-

stances in other American military failures.
It certainly appears that our leaders were

absent on a crucial day in their social studies

. classes.

‘ Bandit’ to slam, blend cultures and rhymes»

Andy Tybout
Sta ff Wri ter
“Hebrew Mamita”
Nov. 12
Public Health Auditorium
7-9 pm. '
Admission is free
A few years ago, Vanessa Hidary
walked onto the stage of HBO’s Def

Poetryjam and recited a poem.
“Iamthe culture bandit,” she said.
“I eat MatzahinHarlem. Iwasthrown
out of Hebrew school ’cause I spent
Rosh Hashanah at the Puerto Rican
Day Parade.”
She went on to emphatically an-
nounce her love of all cultures and
theirvarious eccentricities. The crowd

_went wild.

“It was an amazing, inspiring ex-

‘ perience,” Hidary, who often goes by

the name “The HebrewMamita,” said.
“I thought, [the show] was aforum for
talking about being Jewish that was
really excit1'ng and differen ” A
Now, Hidary is a diva of the slam
poetry circuit with her critically ac-

- claimed show, “Culture Bandit.” The

showbeganasasinglepoemand now
features music, monologues and, of
course, poetry.

“Thatpoem ended up turning into
afullshowthatwasjustanoutpouring
ofallthe different cultural experiences

‘ that I’ve been through,” said Hidary.

The show features myriad styles
and inﬂuences, a diverse landscape
of words and music.

“I wanted to use a soundtrack that
was going from the ’70s through the
presentday,”I-Iidary said. “I justreally
used music that I felt like inﬂuenced
the time.”

One genre that parﬁcularly stands
out is hip-hop.

Growing up in New York’s Upper
West Side, Hidary lived in-hip-hop’s
“Golden Age.”

“Itwas abigtime of inspirationfor
me,” Hidary said, citingPublic Enemy

. and thejungle Brothers as two of her

favorite groups. “Itwas avery special
timeinhip—hop.” _

While the show is a coordinated
amalgamation of styles, it’s partly
based on a confusing period in Hi-
dary’s life — her youth.

_As a member of an urban melting
pot, Hidary said she often felt con-
flicted about herjewish identity.

“Iwasinaplace oftryingto grapple
with how I felt proud of it,” Hidary
said. “It took me a while to get to a
place ofhavingpride about [myjewish
identity] and wanting to learn about
my cult11re.”

Itwas herart, she said, that helped
coax her out of such a malaise.

“My writing in general was just a
way to express my journey and talk
about the grapples of identity,” Hi-‘
dary said. “Through my arts, I was
able to come full circle and kind of
understand and express a lot of my
experiences.” p l

‘ Herdiscoveryofthegenre—blend—
ingartthat she performs on stage took
alongtime to make. ‘

Originallyanactress, Hidarybegan

writing solo-show monologues during

Apple miniserver easy on setup, lighton I power

Donald Campbell
Columnist

  

Small is big in technology right
now, which is why Apple recently
announced the creation of a server
version of the Apple mini. ' _

Apparently, Apple’s thought pro-

cess was, “If people want desktops .'

and laptops to be on the small side,
why wouldn’t they want to create
a home or office network using a
miniature server?”

The server boasts the Apple OS
X Snow Leopard Server and allows

customers to connect Windows and
Macintosh computers in an office
or home environment to make or-
dinary server services quickly and
easily available.

The mini targets small busi-
nesses that wish to revamp their
computing infrastructure, but the
mini might ﬁnd itselflost in a limbo
of uselessness.

OS X Snow Leopard Server pro-

vides additional features to allow

quick and easy networking, as well

as hosting some services that are

vital to the ordinary business. _
The mini server can easily be set

up to run a web host and host an
intranet site, run an e-mail server
application that provides in—house
e-mail communication and behave
as a ﬁle server to provide a central
ﬁle repository in which office com-
puters connect.

The new mini comes with the
same dual-core processor and mem-
ory available in its $799 non-server
mini brother, and instead of having
an optical drive, it has two precon-
ﬁgured 500-GB hard drives.

‘ A server usually becomes neces-
sary when a substantial population
pf people begins using a network

, ,_,:.-_.-_.x.-__.._..__,,,, ', _ ,_..

and wishes to collaborate without
shouting across a room. ,

Many organizations distribute
server-esque tasks across multiple
computers that were never designed
to beservers. Apple said it hopes that
these organizations will embrace a
server revoluﬁon and buy mini serv-
ers en masse.

Depending on the size of the
organization, the mishmash of dis-

tributed computing services might .

be just ﬁne, and a mini might be an
unnecessary expense.

Take, for example, a small retail
business. Apple mentions this type

Vofbusiness as one of the rnini’s majors:

targets on its website.
_ The proprietor owns several
computers connected to cash reg-

isters, as well as a general purpose

machine-located in the back that
runs Microsoft Ofﬁce, contains some
ﬁnancial wizardry software and gen- V‘ ’
erally performs all of the everyday
computer tasks. ~

, The cash registers easily connect
to the general purpose computer
to register sales and record other

ﬁnancial transactions as they hap— 

pen. V
The ofﬁce computer is therefore

a server — part time. It’s a nice, clean setup
that is relatively simple to maintain.

4.:- Apple said it hopes that with the Mac mini
server, the owner of that shop will add the
server and centralize many of the business’
computing tasks. '

The mini server will provide inventory lists,
ﬁnancial records and general ﬁle hosting. Be-
cause it is small and runs Apple’s user-friendly
software, it should be why the mini is chosen
over all other entry—level server offerings.

For larger organizations that have the
technical support capacity and the ﬁnances
to handle it, the mini is an attractive idea.

' Dedicated servers are generally more re-

“liable, as they are not subject to the errors,
crashes and security issues of general purpose
machines. '

There are some concerns with the mini
server, however. The mini might not have a
place in the world of servers.

The mini’s major advantages are its size
and easy conﬁguration.

Its disadvantages are that for many small
businesses, its existence. is unnecessary, its
price is $999 and it is no more powerful than
the $799 ordinary

z .. fl? - -

emisflt in saturated market

For organizations that could legitimately
beneﬁt from a server, the price of $999 is a
little steep for what they get.

Those businesses wish to have a server but
have the support to integrate a more hard-
core server running Linux or Windows, and
they don’t care about machine space require-
ments. 1

A $600 or $700 Dell PowerEdge server
could more efficiently meet their server
needs.

For the remaining, possibly not—so-small
businesses, the mini might not be powerful
enough.

At a certain level of server requirements,
a company would do best to buy a more pow-
erﬁil server. If the company is a loyal Apple
customer, it should consider an Xserve.

The Apple mini server could therefore
be a legitimate purchase for businesses with
moderate computing requirements and deep
concern that their servers be no bigger than
a box of chocolates.

For the rest of the world, the mini server
appears to be easily trounced by the Dell Pow-
erEdges and HP servers available at surpris-
ingly low costs.

Harper proves her heart’s as big as he

Junior volleyball player juggles team practices, school work and commitment to volunteerism

Harper< 1

Africa who have AIDS.
But until she achieves that goal
after graduation, Harper wants to

‘ volunteer as much as possible around

Pittsburgh.

“The things that she does, the vol— _

leyball camps she’s worked with, is
great,” head coach Toby Rens said.

"“She really embodies the idea of the
student-athlete, and she’s someone v
who gets it done on the volleyball '

co 5’ .
Harpertook aunique sense of giv-

A‘ ing from her trip to Africa. A
Since coming to Pitt, Harper has

volunteered extensively in the area.
Her commitment to public service is
a rarity in alife dominated by an end-
less routine of practicing, schoolwork
and matches.

Harper said she gets her volun-

g teering ideas from Charles Small, the

assistantdirector ofthe Life Skills pro-
gram at the University. Her favorite
programs are the ones that involve
children. —

“I'love playingwith them.Achild’s

smile canbrighten up my day,” Harper
said. '

One of her favorite experiences
took place last year when she went to
Children’s Hospital in Oakland to color
with kids in the hospital. ’

“We used to just go there and color
with the kids, and itwas so funto me,”

i she said. “Itwas so ﬁm just to go back _

to your childhood and color a picture
and to givethat pictureto akid — they
love gettingtha ”

Harper enjoys when the kids
she works with consider her a role

_ model. i

“I can show them that I’m a Pitt
athlete, andl dothis and you canlook
up to meforthat,”Harpersaid. “That’s
howyou can get alot of people to look
up to you, and they look up to you not -
only because you’re an athlete, but

"you’re a person helping them.”

Harper became a starting middle
hitterfor Pittthis season. It is herfirst
season startingwiththe Panthers. Last
year, she only played in 20 sets. This
year, she helped the Panthers 

nearly 20 matches.

She’s a vocal leader on the court.

“She can be a very big catalyst for
the rest oftl1e team,” Rens said. “She’s
focused, and it’s nice to have her in
that position.” .

V On the court, she’s ablocking ma-
chine for the Panthers (18-8 overall,
10-2 Big East).

Her 6—foot frame and long, lanky
armsprovidethe perfectbodytypefor
a middle hitter: She is second on the
team inblocks, averaging 1.16 per set.
The Panthers are eighth in the country,
averaging2.82 blocks per set.

“From my experience of being
blocked, I understand how it feels,
andlpersonally hate it,” she said. “It’s

almost like access denied, and you are ’

sending a message when you block

A someone straight down to where the

ballisunplayable. It’s the most
part of the game.” , -
Many athletes spend their down-

time in other ways. But Harper is

unique in that her time is spent help-
ing others. _ -

Junior Imani Harper (right) is having a successful volleyball season,
. but she’s making an even bigger impact off the court.

Volleyball team sets school shutout record

Withalittle help from otherteams,
the Panthers could climb to a No. 2

Cincinnati holds the tiebreaker
over Pitt because of its 3-1 victory on
Oct. 3. If Pitt wants to jump Cincin-
nati, the Bearcats would have to lose
one of their  two home matches
againstConnecticutand St.John’s. The
Husldes are trying to secure a No. 7

The No. 22 Pitt women’s basketball team

C" will be looking to get past the Sweet 16 this

season, a goal they fell short of completing
the last two seasons.

Theirjourney begins tonight at 7:00, as .

head coach Agnus Berenato and company
take on the Seton Hill Grifﬁns in an exhibi-
tion game at the Petersen Events Center.
This exhibition game means more than
most to Berenato, whose daughter Clare is
a freshman on the opposing team.
~ Clare, an Oakland Catholic graduate,
plays guard for the Grifﬁns.
“I’m really proud of my daughter,” Ber-
enato said. “But once the ball goes up, it’s
all business.” '

November 10, 2009 I The Pitt News l WWW.pittneWs.com

A familiar face in the crowd

Clare is very familiar with Pitt’s program
and players because she spent many days
this summer conditioning with the team.

While the familial ties make a nice story
going into this game, the Panthers will
have to avoid that distraction to get the
season of to a good start, even if it is only
an exhibition game.

While the Panthers lost their two lead-
ing scorers from last season in guards
Shavonte Zellous (22.6 points per game)
and Xenia Stewart (10.6 points per game),
they return several experienced players
who will look to step up this season.

The team should be -ﬁne at the guard
position. Juniors Jania Sims, Shayla Scott
and Taneisha Harrison, and the team’s lone
senior, Sophronia Sallard will anchor the
team from the backcourt.

 Pitt women’s basketball team to face Seton Hill — and coach Berenato’s freshman daughter

“Jainia Sims is our coach on the court,” '

Berenato said. “We’re excited have our ﬂoor
general back [from last season] .”

Scott and Harrison both averaged
slightly more than eight points last sea-
son, and Scott started in all 33 of the team’s
games.

Sims, on the other hand, barely saw
any game action as shetwas injured in the
team’s season opener against Texas A&M.
When healthy, Sims has shown she can
be one of the premier point guards in the
Big East. .

Pitt will be bigger down low than most
teams this season. Sophomores Shawnice
“Pepper” Wilson and Kate Popovec look to
build on their promising freshman cam-
paigns. A

Wilson, standing at 6—foot—6 and Pop-
ovec at 6—foot—3, averaged 6.8 and 4.3
points per game last season, respective-
ly.

The Panthers will need these and other
reserve players to improve on their totals
from last season- if they want to get to that
elusive Elite Eight and beyond. . »

But ﬁrst, the team must get past Clare
and the Seton Hill Grifﬁns.
