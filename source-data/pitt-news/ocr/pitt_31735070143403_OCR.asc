Pitt sets tuition rates.
while waiting to hear
about state funding .

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Pitt student Brittany Moreland

said she doesn’t know ‘what she

will do when tuitionrises this
year.

She already works three days
per week, and she switched her
major from pre-medicine to busi-
ness partially because she “didn’t

' have time to study.”

She said, “It’s difﬁcult. It’s a lot
to balance.” _ 4

Still, this year’s tuition increase
of $5 62is the lowest the University
has passed in 10 years — so far, at
least. A V

But additional fees ' might
come, depending on how much .—
or, how little — Pitt receives from
the stimulus package.

The executive and budget com-
mittees of Pitt’s Board of Trustees
voted unanimously last week to
increase tuition for students in the
University’s colleges of Arts and
Sciences, General Studies, Edu-

cation, Social Work and Dental S

Medicine by $512 to $13,344. Out-
of-state students in those colleges
will pay $562. more, as their tuition
rises to $23,042. P
While the official tuition rate is
set, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said in the meetings in Posvar
Hall that students might have to
pay additional fees as early as this
fall if the University doesn’t get as
much money as it would like from
state legislators and the federal
stimulus. ’ A
Nordenbergsaid he could not
predict the value of any surcharg-

Wtakes the stage, he likes
to -sing about ethics and

diversity over heavy synthesizers
and pulsing dance beats.

Audience members often give
him confused looks and don’t
know how to react to his uncon-
ventional style, long, swinging
locks, signature black cowboy hat
and random card throwing.

And he likes it.

“I like to make sure they’re
actively involved in what’s going .
on,” he said. “When you go to see
live music, I think the perfor-
mance and the live activity on the
stage are more important than
the music.” i

orty years ago this past

onday, the members of

the Apollo 11 crew landed

on the moon, becoming the

ﬁrst people to do so. In light of this

anniversary, The Pitt News decided

to take a look at what The Pitt News

was covering 40 years ago. Here’s
what we found:

Jan. 13 — Pitt women earn their
freedom — freedom from curfew,
that is. The University offers anew
program that allows female students
21 and younger to stay out past 2:30
a.m., provided they have parental
permission and have been full-time
students for at least two 15-week
terms. Women participating in the
program must have special ID cards
issued by University Housing and
participate in an orientation ses-
sion.

Jan. 16 — The Black Action Soci-

ety holds a seven—hour lock-in in the
University’s computer center to push
for “better action on the demands of
students.” Another 55 to 65 students
gathered in the chancellor’s ofﬁce.
Wesley Posvar, chancellor at the time,
agreed to create a special team to re-
cruit black students to the University
and to formally recognize, pending
approval from the faculty Senate,
the birthday of Martin Luther King
Jr. and the anniversary of Malcolm
X’s death. He promised to create an
institution to provide ﬁnancial aid
and scholarships for black students
and to designate a section for them
in Hillman Library.

Feb. 5 — A student who trans-
ferred from Ohio State University to
Pitt tells The Pitt News that the FBI
hired her to act as a drug informer.
“You become the lonejudas with the
FBI hounding you for information
once you’ve come through the ﬁrst
time. Curiosity drove me into that
position, guilt brought [me] back to
my senses,” the woman said.

Feb. 7 — An estimated 800 stu-
dents gather in the Common Rooms
of the Cathedral of Learning to give

their demands to then—Chancellor I

Wesley Posvar. Among their de-
mands:

—“That the Dean of Students
Office cease the practice of keeping
secret and unauthorized personnel
ﬁles on nearly all undergraduate
girls.

—That the faculty and teaching
fellows be allowed to freely discard
the grading system at their discre-
tion.”

Feb. 24 -— The state legislature
considers a bill that would ﬁne stu-
dents using lewd, lascivious or vul-

You become the lone Judas with the FBI hounding you for information
once you’ve come through the ﬁrst time.

An anonymous Pitt student claiming to be a drug informer

garwords $50 or imprison them for
30 days. To protest, The Pitt News
prints, in red ink, the words “lewd”
and “vulgar” throughout the paper.
It places the word “obscene” over a
photo that shows a wrestler’s butt.
The wrestler’s opponent had him
in a headlock.

March24—The University took
disciplinary action against eight stu-
dents involved in a panty raid that
occurred the previous week, The Pitt
News reports. Four female students
received social probation “after they
were accused of throwing articles
from their windows during the
panty raid.” One male student was
suspended and three others were
negotiating their punishments with
the dean.

June 3 — The Pitt News reports,
“One year and seven months, hun-
dreds of meetings and persistence
by [a] dedicated student—faculty
committee has produced CAS 1 —— a

three-credit course in human sexual-
ity to be taught this fall.”

July 18 — “Authorities are still in-
vestigating the early Tuesday-morn-
ing bombing of Room 405, Tower B,
by persons who used ‘an extremely
lethal’ homemade pipe bomb,” the
paper reports. “The residents of the
room, Tony Embessi and David Ro-
hanna, were not home at the time of
the 3:25 a.m. blast. Ironically, Emb-
essi —— afellowwho doesn’t go out at
night much —- had gone to afriend’s
room to listen to records. Rohanna
was out of town.”

Sept. 12 —— The Pitt News reports
that “the Smile is gone from Atwood
Street.” An old, female resident of
the central Oakland street had died
the previous week. “She used to sit
in her doorway next to the sidewalk
from early in the morning until it got

dark, listening to a yellowed radio
and giving a toothless half—smile to
students passing by,” the paper re-
ports. “Oftentimes, she would ask
one of them to run up the street to
the Giant Eagle to pick up a loaf of
bread or a quart of milk for her 
They always did.

“AND_ THEN ONE day, she just
died. She fell over backward in her
chair in the early evening. A large
crowd had gathered to stare at her
misplaced dress and gaping eyes.
No one knew her name.

“The policeman standing at the
front of the crowd had a lot of trouble
deciding what to do with the body.
‘VVe’ll have to take her somewhere,’ he
said. ‘To the morgue or something.
Does she have any relatives?’

“THE OLD LADY of Atwood

anymore to say hello to strangers
walking down the block. She died
as she had lived, shameless — with
nothing except old age, a welfare
check once a month and an ancient

blaring radio. Very few will know
or care.”

Sept. 19 — Pitt celebrates 100

7 years of collegiate football. The Pitt
News reports that “only 22 schools '

in the ﬁrst hundred years won more
games than Pitt’s 403  But Pitt’s
great moments on the gridiron were
accomplished years ago. The 1969
edition of Panther football has no
All—Americans and no hopes of an
undefeated campaign. This year’s
Panther team has only the memories
of three consecutive 1-9 seasons and
a schedule that pits them against the
nation’s best.”

Oct. 15 — “Today is the Vietnam
Moratorium,” The Pitt News reports.
“It is a clay to ﬁnd out which way you
are going on the war issue. It is a day
to seek education and awareness.”

Dec. 3 —— “For years, young men
in America have been facing one of
the greatest threats to the orderly
continuation of their lives: the Draft.
From 18 to 26, the Draft, like the an-
cient sword ofDamoc1es, has hung
over the heads of these youth, and
caused as much fear. This week, the
Congress of the United States put the
Draft into mothballs and replaced it
with a Draft lottery.”

A letter from the Editor

Change just for the sake of change is not always a good thing. Keeping things the
same just because that’s how we’ve always done it, however, can be just as bad.

You’ve probably noticed that The Pitt News looks a bit different this week. Among
other changes, we now use fonts designed for newsprint and more diverse headline
weights to make reading The Pitt News a smoother experience.

The print edition isn’t the only thing that’s changing, however. Come the beginning
of the school year, www.pittnews.com will be an entirely new experience. To see what
it’s shaping up to look like, visit wvvw.tpnevolve.com.

And as always, let me know what you think of both the print and online redesigns

Orenda adventures beyond borders of musical genres

Orenda 4 4

Mode’s “Walking in My Shoes” for Orenda’s
senior recital. ,

“I always enjoy seeing him, talking to
him, working with him. He’s a very honest
kind of artist, and that’s increasingly rare.
There’s a sense of vulnerability that every
human can connect to, and I think a lot of
musicians try to hide that,” Zahab said.

Orenda said that he is vulnerable on
stage because he is adventurous, experi-
menting in different genres.

“How can I be cocky about something
I don’t know how people will react to?” he
said. “It’s very [much] mine and mine alone.
When you have a bad show in a band, you
share that shame with four or ﬁve other
guys.”

Orenda draws much of his inspiration
from the Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails,
pop and Michaeljackson. Paul Contento,

a friend and member of the Pittsburgh
Electronic Musicians, said that Orenda’s
progressive style could hurt his mainstream
appeal. - \

“I think to get people to dance you need
to have a consistent style. So he has a prob-
lem since he has his unique mesh of styles.
It’s hard for him to get people out there and
to stay out there,’,’ he said.

Zahab said he understands Orenda’s
struggle.

listeners try to hear the same thing, but he’s

trying to push the boundaries,” Zahab said.
Orenda’s music is very personal, and he
rarely changes music after people critique
it. He released his latest album, Ethical
Atheist, on his father’s record label, Primal
Pulse, but said that he doesn’t seek his
father’s approval.
Orenda works hard to not fall into a
genre or an image. .A
“My music stemmed from industrial

music, which is kind of involved with the
goth scene. And I don’t like scenes at all. In

particular, cliques and the way people dress
and act, I think it actually hurts individual-
ity,” he said.

He said that Pittsburgh’s love for classic
rock cover bands and familiar tunes stiﬂes
the spread of new material. However, he
said that he likes the challenge of playing
for people who aren’t fans of electronic
music.

“When I play a show like that, it’s like I’m
doing work. I’m trying to make these goals
and change people’s minds,” he said. “A lot
of people hate electronic music because

5

they think it’s fake or something. A lot of
those people are listening to electronic
music and not realizing it.”

Orenda considers moving to a city with
a thriving electronic music scene, like New
York City or Los Angeles, but he said that
it sounds cliché. But he feels like he could
have a hand in the revitalization of Pitts-
burgh’s live music scene.

“I shou1dn’tjust go where things are
better. I should work on Pittsburgh’s scene,”
he said. “I’d feel like a complete cop—out
moving.”

After receiving letters from numerous
University administrators and 14 of Penn-

less than desirable circumstances.”

increase tuition on the main campus at a
“higher than desirable amount,” or it could
increase the tuition in a smaller amount,
with the understanding that additional
charges could come later. Nordenberg said

’ the board chose the second option because

it wanted to relieve the burden on Pitt’s stu-
dents and their families.

Suzanne Broadhurst, vice chairwoman
of the Board of Trustees, said this is “one of
the most discouraging times I’ve seen as a

University increase its research and strive to

“I think it’s a tragic decision to think that
we might go backward,” she said. “We can-
not afford to let this engine go backward.”

Adrienne Atterberry, who graduated this
spring, couldn’t agree more. She worked in

passed, its version of the bill, and
advocacy groups usually against eas-
ing alcohol-related penalties are in
support, according to the Pittsburgh

- Tribune-Review.

These legislators and groups are
using pragmatism to prioritize the
safety of citizens over aggressive,
unjust policies that trump up claims
of deterrence. Underage or not, no

_ alcohol consumer intends to drink

so muchas towarrant a stomach
pumping. If medical attention is
needed, the legal deterrent means
penalties for a concerned friend:
a summary offense for underage
drinking, aﬁne and possible 90-day
loss of driving license. This proposal
would not encourage more binge
drinking, rather it would lessen the
hesitation to call for help. I .

Ideally, no petty citation would
stop someone from calling for
medical attention when necessary.
However, the line between necessary
and tnottis hazy, and even more so
whenthatperson has been drinking.
By adding hindered judgment and
possible peer pressurenot to “be

This legislation serves a noble

purpose. Some details have yet to‘.

emerge, ‘though. For instance, if only
the “ﬁrst caller” is granted amnesty,

' will others get cited if they wait for

an ambulance with their poisoned
friend? What if three roommates
drink together and one falls ill? Will
one roommate get charged while the
other gets a pass? Some of these is-
sues need to be addressed to reduce
any lingeringfear of prosecution for
distressed drinkers.

Also, swathes of students would

- beneﬁt in other ways. Many profes-

sions require blemish-free records.
Future teachers, lawyers or officers
would not have to worry about one
offense ruining their lifelong ca-
reers. _

Underage drinking as a whole is
still a crime, but this proposal right-
ﬁilly assists people caught in dire
circumstances. '

To meet halfway, Felicity De-
Bacco-Emi, program director for
the Pennsylvania DUI Association,
advocates alcohol-education classes.
Rather than criminal records and
other consequences, callers would

have toattend 12,hours of class. —

That is a fair trade-off that would
hopeﬁilly provide some substantive
information inthe process.
Legislators, lobbyists and college
officials must alert the University
community about this proposal.
If it passes —— as it should — the
policy would only prove effective if
underage drinkers know they would
not get in trouble trying to help a
friend. * ‘ v

If there’s one thing I’ve re-affirmed
while spending my summer in Mon-
golia, it’s that timeless lesson which
every mom, preschool teacher and
motivationalposter seems to declare:
Nothing is impossible.

After a lengthy drive over the pot-
hole-ridden countryside —— during
which we got incredibly lost, stopped
twice for salted milk tea and paused

to admire a passing nomadictroupe _

— my friendjohn and I ﬁnally found
ourselves in Mongolia’s Arkhangai
Province. We were spendingthe week
with a herding family who, despite
-not being able to speak English, in-
sisted that we wear traditional dress,
coats and milkthe yaks, among other

~ activities.

The highlight of the experience
came later one evening as we gath-
ered around a stove in the center of
Grandma’s ger — a circular felt yurt,
or nomadic tent. Through the steam, I
watched in horror as Uncle Batdelger

slid_a massive gray pot from under ‘

the bed and placed it on the table.

. I hesitantly peered inside, ﬁnding

myselfface-to-face with my worst

, nightmare: twisted bits of intestines,

veiny pieces of meat and something
that vaguely resembled a brain. As if

5 the sight alone weren’t nauseating

enough, the dish was accompanied

 by an all-too—distinctive smell —

imagine the scent of a foul barn plus

  

a splash of spoiled milk.

The dish was called makh, which
literally translates as “meat.” Just a
big pile ofboiled sheep innards. Con-
sidered abit of a delicacy in the coun-
tryside, the meal is usually reserved
for honored guests and requires just
two serving utensils: a knife to hack
the meat into sizeable chunks and a
wet rag to wipe up the residue.

_ After reaching into the bowl with
a loud squishing sound, Uncle Bat-
delger tossed an indiscernible chunk
of meat in my direcﬁon. The whole
family watched expectantly, waiting

would do: swallowed my
pride and, with it, the

for me to_sample the meal. _

I stared at the ﬂoppy piece of in-
testine in my hand, and it seemed to
stare back. I pictured myselfbolting
for the door, but then again, refusing
the morsel would be offensive to the
family. Instead, I did what any classy
girl would do: swallowed my pride
and, with it, the sheep bit.‘ Apparently

' satisﬁed with my efforts, Batdelger
: nodded and dug in;

But just as I quickly learned that

too did I realize that neither is over-
crowding a vehicle to the point of
near-collapse.

Each July, Mongolia screeches
to a halt in celebration of Naadam,
an impressive athletic festival that’s
akin to a mini Olympics. For three
days, the holiday takes center-stage
as government offices close, tourists
pack the streets and massive crowds
ﬂoodto enjoy the three traditional
“manly sports”: wrestling, archery
and horse racing.

In true festival spirit, my friends
and I made grandiose plans to see
the races —— but when our city-bus-
turned-Naadam—shuttle suddenly
lurched to a halt in the middle of the
Mongolian steppes, we knew some-
thing wasn’t right. '

The road ahead was closed for
someunknown reason, sowe grump-
ily unloaded from the bus as a sense
of disappointment settled in. With
our transportation plans on indeﬁ-
nite hold, how could we ever get to
the races?

The answer came just a few min-
utes later, as a middle-aged local
approached us with a toothy grin.
“Where you go?” he asked, wiping a
ﬁstful of sweat from his brow before
extendingaheaxty handshake. Using
our broken Mongolian vocabulary
and even worse miming skills, we
tried our best to explain our desti-
nation.

Peering inside the vehicle, I spot-

To the Editor,

In hisjuly 15 column, “New Republicans need new ideas,” Mason
Herron is right to implore Republicans to present a coherent policy

toward socialism. To do this, however, Republicans must discard their
affections for the Religious Right. The Religious Right, by seeking to
impose a Christian theocracy, has poisoned the Republican Party and
pushed Republicans into restricting reproductive freedom, champion-

Folk band brings ‘Love’ to Byham

Kelsey Shea
Assistant A&E Editor

With any great idea, there comes a
risk of exponential growth. As was
the case with The Decemberist’s lat-
est album The Hazards ofLove.
The band’s ﬁfth album had hum-
ble beginnings with songwriter and
frontman Colin Meloy planning to
write a single song with the same

.title of a 1964 Anne Briggs EP, but

as he began to write, the one song
snowballed into a full—blown rock
opera and ﬁill album. i

For a band tied to the word “lit—

erary” and known for songs with

intricate plots of murder, love, rape,
sinking ships andjapanese folklore,
a-rock opera seemed almost inevi-
table. I ‘ .

“I don’t know if it was inevitable,
but it makes total sense,” December-

ists guitarist Chris Funk said. “The

 

Crane Wife was just three songs, but
this is a huge body of wor .”

The Hazards of Love weaves the
knotty tale of a young girl, Margaret,
her shape—shifting lover William and
their ill-fated romance that’s plagued
by his magical queen mother and her
bastardly ch_ild—killing co—conspira—
tor the Rake.-

_“It’s really difﬁcult because it’s
not a concrete story. It’s more like

the CliffsNotes of some other story »

out there.”
But Funk’s main concern isn’t

really interpretation or plot in the-

album.
“It’s a bit frustrating. I don’t get

Though all signs point other-

tribute band to Dylan Thomas.
Sure, the name comes from a
Thomas short story, and its de-
but album —— Of The Cathmawr

set scene within the same work,
but guitaristjames Elkington
said the band is more than
a tribute band for the Welsh
author. ‘
“The album is called [OfThe

rock on at 2:30 a.m. for Gillis’ set.
“I never want the audience to be chill, but I

_ don’t want people to be so aggressive that it’s

annoying for everyone else. [The Rothbury
audience] was very large, and because it was
a few weeks after Michael Jackson’s death, I
played a bunch of my stuff that sampled his
songs, and it deﬁnitely resonated with the
crowd,” he said. ‘

Gillis said that though playing in his home-

town has a different feel now than it did when '

he rose to popularity in 2006, he still enjoys
returning and playing for friends who watched
him when he only played for “crowds of 15
people.” , .

Hesaid his friends “have a unique per-
spective on me that not many. people have.
They know I’m playing bigger shows now.
Ultimately, everything has come from being
out of Pittsburgh, so it’s a very cool thing to
come back home.” _

Gillis also said he’s excited to show the
Pittsburgh audience what he has been working
on recently, even though he has no plans to
stop performing to put out an album soon.

“Half the material in the concert is new
stuff,” he said. “I’m on pace to make an album
every two years, and I don’t care if I make it-
quicker or longer. I am constantly working
on stuff. I don’t think I would be completely

comfortable with just stopping [the shows] '

and trying to pump out an album.”

In addition to Girl Talk, the concert will fea-
ture bands that Gillis said he helped select to
make the concert a sort of “mini—festiv .”

He said, “A lot of the bands are people that
I’m friends with or have played with back in-
the day, so there’s a lot of awesome music
happening in Pittsburgh right now.”

Some of these artists include I Modey

of Jarrod Weeks (Lord Grunge) and Jackson
O’Connell-Barlow, who uses multiple stage
names.

The duo, who toured with Girl Talk this
past fall, said it is very excited for the show
and expect crazy things from the crowd, with
O’Connell-Barlow citing in an e-mail inter-
view “anywhere between head—nodding and
propulsive ejaculation and/or levitation” as
appreciated behaviors.

“We try to put on a balls-to -the-wall show,
no matter what the crowd is like. I guess I
prefer that the crowdzjnot throw s**t at us.
That’s about it,” Weeks said. V

Weeks also said he has never been disap-
pointed by the number of awesome bands and
steady stream of good music in the Pittsburgh
music scene and that it would “make Pitts-
burgh attractive for outside artists. It might
also make them j ealous, but f"‘** ’em.”

The duo has only good things to say about
Gillis, with whom it has been acquainted for
quite some time.

“We’ve known Gillis since the days when
you had to midi-chain at least 12 PCs together
to conduct a proper mash-up. He is one of the
most chill and delightful individuals I’ve had
the pleasure of knowing,” O’Connell-Barlow
said.

Weeks echoed those sentiments, adding

that he was excited about playing at a venue

he used to frequent as “a youngin’ when it was

the IC Light Amphitheater.” He said he doesn’t

expect anything from the show other than a
good time for all involved. ’

O’Connell-Barlow, however, made one
tempting allusion to a possible surprise.

“One should never conﬁ_rm nor deny sur-
prises, butI am hoping to transform into pure
light,” he said.

To those attending the concert: Bring

Concert, Kenny Chesney feat. Sugar-
land and Montgomery Gentry

Ah, country concerts at Heinz Field.
The stadium gets packed with both re-
ﬁned city—slickers who appreciate tal-
ented vocalists’ like Sugarland’s Jennifer
Nettles and tailgating shirtless people
covered with American ﬂag and bald
eagle tattoos. This show, however, was
mainly the latter. Nonetheless, with their
endless sets of party anthems and drink-
ing songs, Kenny Chesney and company
rocked Heinz Field like the Pitt football

« team can only dream of doing. But the

concert was only half as entertaining as
watching people react to ﬁnding out the
cost of a Heinz Field beer.

Album, Grizzly Bear’s Veckatimest

Unforumately for the band, but fortu-
nate for its listeners, Grizzly Bear’s latest
album, I/Zméatimest, leaked months before
its May 26 release date. What I found in
this leaked version of the album forced

it was released. With this 12—song disc,
Grizzly Bear managed to take its already

And it did‘ it just in time to play for sold-
out audiences throughout the summer.

Flowers —— for summer? ‘Ground-
breaking. Sure, hippies have been rock-
ing this look for decades, but I’m a late
bloomer —— so to speak — and didn’t
start until this year. I’ve been pinning

because I’m horrible at seasonal dress-

Television, “Nurse Jackie”

Edie Falco (“The
Sopranos”) defects
from HBO to play
the titular charac-
ter in Showtime’s
newest drama se-
ries. A far cry from
“House” — and the
formulism and pre-
dictability inherent

within —— “Nursejackie” leans heavilymon
Falco’s brilliant portrayal of a painkiller-

snorting New York nurse attempting to '

balance her traditional family life with
the starkness of the urban hospital where
she works. The show also offers one of the
most realistic portrayals of gay characters
—»not just one, but two, and they’re not
in a relationship with each other —— on
TV today. “Nurse Jackie” is the perfect
draught to quench your TV thirst dur-
ing the seemingly endless summer TV
drought. '

Decemberists weave plot and music Without ‘Hazard’

as many beer breaks between songs as I’d like,”
he said.

Dark plots are hardly uncharted territo— _

ry for The Decemberists, whose characters
usually meet dismal ends. Meloy can take
responsibility for guiding more than 70 ﬁc-
tional characters to their deaths in his musical
discography.

But fans new and old aren’t turned offby the
somber stories. Rather, The Hazards of Love
has sold more than 19,210 copies in its ﬁrst

week when it was released in March. .

“I think people are ‘cool with it. From the
onset, it’s pretty much understood that this is
fantasy,” Funk said.

Along with darker themes, The December-
ists tinged its previously folk sound with dra-
matically slicing electric guitars that ensnared
the band into what it considers its metal-ish
phase.

“We really assumed the role of another
band for a bit, and it’s so ﬁm to play,” Funk

said. “But we all know that this isn’t the real
Decemberists. But that ability to take on dif-
ferent genres is a part of who we are as a band.

So I really don’t think we’re suddenly going to

continue our metal side.”

The Hazards ofLove’s success further pro-
pelled The Decemberists from college radio
staples to an emergingly mainstream band
with a growing fan base.

“I think as an artist you want to reach as.

ing as other mental illnesses.”

She said she decided to create an art ex-

hibit concentrating on the disorder because

she feels that sexual assault is too often de-
scribed in numbers and statistics.

“I want to bring it back to the actual ex-
perience,” she said. “We need to go beyond
the numbers and represent the stories behind
those numbers.” .

The gallery was partly inspired by a book
on the disorder called “Invisible Heroes” by
Belleruth N aparstek. In the book, Naparstek
challenges the idea that talk therapy helps
PTSD sufferers. The part of the brain that
controls speech is inhibited by PTSD, and

it takes more creative methods to get to the .

root of the problem, Naparstek says.
Hutchinson’s gallery is her attempt at

‘ those creative methods. Using 40rolls of duct

tape, she crafted four different tree_s.
The trees were originally supposed to be

aesthetic to the writing, simply to create .

a “lost in the forest” ambiance. But later,
Hutchinson said she decided to make the
trees represent the individual women.

One represents a woman looking at her

 , wrinkles in the mirror, and another tells the

story of a woman trapped in her own body af-
ter her father molested her during puberty.

“Trees are trapped in one spot. That’s
ﬁne for trees, but for a human, that means
they’re stuck,” Hutchinson said.

Hutchinson has never taken an art class
at Pitt, but she applied for and received a
grant through a Brackenridge Fellowship
project. She has worked on the exhibit all
summer with the help of her adviser Delanie
Jenkins. ‘

“This project taught me how draining art
can be,” Hutchinson said. “Last summer, "I

unusual position in herﬁrstyearvvith
the WNBA’s Detroit Shock — starting
the game on the bench.

However, Zellous is embracing
her new role. Through 13 games,
she’s averaged 23.4 minutes a game

the defending champion Shock and
second among WNBA rookies. Her

“I love my position of coming off

Zellous started four games this
season, but has since been used as a

“I can see how the opponent is

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

After being named a ﬁnalist for
the United States’ women’s Under-
19 basketball team in late May,

son is expected to be back before
practice starts in the fall.

Offensive line could surprise this season

An Olt—mann’s Opinion

Alex Oltmanns
Staff Writer

 

With the departures of impact skill
players such as LeSean McCoy, La-
Rod Stephens—Howling and Derek
Kinder, many have already begun
to question the Pitt football team’s
offensive capabilities .for the up-
coming season.

Yet, the one thing _that many
skeptics seem to overlook is that
the Panthers’ offensive line is be-
ginning to shape up as one of the
strongest in the Big East.

Because of the potential, play-
ers on the offensive line know how
much pressure falls on them this
season to guide the offense.

“You can have a great quar-
terback,’running back and wide
receiver, but if the lineman can’t
protect, then it doesn’t matter,”
senior center Robb Houser said. “If

the offensive line plays well, then V

the offense will probably play well,
too.” _ .

startersfrom the line last season.’

Junior left tackle Jason Pinkston
and senior right guard John Mal-
ecki will retain their starting spots
from last year, while it appears that
highly touted sophomore Lucas
Nix will beat out last year’s starter,
Joe Thomas, at right tackle. Chris
Jacobson assumes the starting role
at left guard.

The emergence of Nix passing a
former starter —— and a good one at
that — on the depth chart speaks
volumes of the talent that coach
Dave Wannstedt has recruited onto

the offensive line, and if ithasn’t _
A yet, then it will certainly pay divi- .

dends in 2009.

“Lucas has gotten a lot bet-

“He’s really been taking pride in
his play.” i

Gibbs hopesto build off international
experience and send Pitt to Final Four

Courtesy USA Basketball

Ashton Gibbs [left] ﬁnished the tournament averaging 9.8 points per game, but it was
his defense that impressed his coach, Jamie Dixon [right].

Champions 4 16

and averaged 40.1 rebounds and 6.2 blocks per
game.

Dixon said part ofthe reason for success was
the play of Gibbs, who led the United States with
203 minutes played in the toumament;

“Coach Painter and Coach Lowery did a lot
of the substituting and they really wanted him in
there at all times,” Dixon said about Gibbs. “He
became our best perimeter defender and that’s
what we need from him next year at Pitt.” .

Gibbs ﬁnished fourth on the team with 9.8
points per game, while also recording seven
steals and seven rebounds in the tournament.

The strong play of Gibbs was a good sign for
Dixon, who expects Gibbs to make abig impact
for Pitt basketball next season.

“Through allthe things, Ithinkthe most im-
portant thingas aprogram [at Pitt] is thatAshton
was able to play,” Dixon said. “We had a couple

‘ point guards drop out of camp and he really got
thrust into that role. He did a really good job.”

Thaﬁs good news forfanswho hopeto see the
Panthers returnto the same post—season success
they’ve enjoyed the last few years. And if that’s

going to happen, Gibbs will need to be a part of
it — something that he doesn’t mind doing.

“I just want to continue playingthe Waylwas
overseas,” Gibbs said. “I thought I was playing
good ball  andiwantto bring mywinningways
back to get us to a Final Four and hopeﬁilly a
National Championship.”

For Dixon, coachingin an international tour-
nament added to his coaching strategy.

“It reinforced the value of good defense,”
Dixon said about what he’ll bring back to Pitt ‘
basketball. “It was really just reinforcing some
things, having good shooters, good kids.”

Since Pitt’s roster next season is one of the
youngestin recentyears, experience at any level
is goingto help the team. And although freshman
forward Taylor did not make the ﬁnal roster,
Gibbs said he still feels Taylor will be ready for
next season.

“I thinkhe learned alot,” Gibbs said. “Hewas
playing against the best players in the country.
I think he got better overall and prepared for
the upcoming season. He’s going to be a great

‘ player for us.”

New coach allows offensive line to be ‘more flexible’

Football 4 17

new position for him.

Forjacobson, he will have to ﬁll the only
void in the line left by the graduation of
C._]. Davis, who is now with the_Carolina
Panthers. .

But the coaches said they are conﬁdent
injacobson, as he is another former highly
coveted recruit and a stellar run-blocker.

As new offensive coordinator Frank
Cignetti takes over for the departed Matt
Cavanaugh, the offense will undergo some
changes. ,.

Cignetti’s style is similar to Cavanaugh’s,
but the linemen said they feel he will add a
few new dimensions to help in protection.

“We’ve‘ had a good spring to get used
to the new offense,” Houser said. “Noth-
ing much has changed except a couple new
wrinkles that allows us to be more ﬂexible
and to pick up more blitzes.”

While the Panthers struggled at times
with pass protection last season, they led
the way for McCoy in his stellar sophomore
season in which he rushed for more than
1,400 yards, and they’re continuing to im-
prove with both blocking aspects.

“Personally, I like the smash mouth style
of run-blocking more,” Maleckisaid. “But
as linemen, we’re comfortable blocking ei-
ther way.”

The line also credits the work of the
coaching staff in helping it continue to im-
prove on last season, as offensive line coach
Tony Wise and strength and conditioning
coach Buddy Morris have meshed the work
in the weight room with the technique on
the ﬁeld. —

“Coach Wise is transitioning what Coach
Morris teaches us in the weight room onto
the ﬁeld,” Houser said. “We’re videotaped
during our workouts so we can see how each

  Wings 6,0 ~ 8p Darly

Karaoke Every TI’ll1l“S{lc’;?j/

workoutincorporates to the drills.”

While the offensive line will be the ﬁrst
to admit that McCoy’s dazzling moves in the
open ﬁeld made it look good during the last
two seasons, it must continue to help the
running game now that McCoy is gone.

“We feel as an offensive line that we have
pressure to perform and make holes to run
through,” Malecki said. “Shady made us look
good last season, but we’re just trying to get
better week to week, regardless of who’s in

the backﬁeld.”

Whoever does end up starting in the
backﬁeld this season just might have more
success than most anticipate. If the line
blocks like it’s shown, the running backs
will ﬁnd success and Bill Stull should have
plenty of time to hit receivers.

The old football adage that “the game
is won and lost in the trenches” will surely
apply to the Panthers this season. And the
linemen fully embrace it.

Berenato: Pitt ‘took care of Zellous for life in the WN BA’

Zellous 4 16

on the team.

“I can honestly say that in the time she was
at Pitt, Shavonte really took her skills to the
next level,” Berenato said. “The skills that she
worked on were what we call teammate skills.
She wanted to be a leader and wanted to lead
her team and Pitt as far as they could go into
the NCAA Toumamen .”

Last year, Zellous was the leader of a Pitt
squad that advanced to the Sweet 16, the Pan-
thers’ second consecutive trip to that round.
Now Zellous has the opportunity to learn from
the veterans on her new team. The experienced

players help her scout other WNBA teams, Zel-
lous said, because they know the makeup and
style of each opponent. ’

"‘They‘ tell me their weaknesses, their
strengths, what not to give them and all the
extra things. I just learn and listen to them
because they know the game,” Zellous said.
“They are helping me become a great player
and one of these days I’m going to be just like
they are.”

Berenato said that Zellous’ skills are just one
of the reasons why the guard will ﬁnd success
in the WNBA. Another reason — and one that

Novum Pharmaceutical Research Services, oneof the world’s leading research tcornpanies in the
testing of generic medications, has a great opportunity for males to earn up to $1,000.00 by
participating in one of our paid research studies. This study will evaluate two generic
 testosterone gels compared to two testosterone gels that are already approved and on the market.

' makes Zellous stand out — Berenato said, is

her personality.

“She has a smile the size of California and
she really enjoys playing the game,” Berenato
said. “When you have somebody on the court
that plays with true passion, the game seems
larger than what it is because she has what we
call ‘charisma on the court.”’

Zellous took that charisma with her to the
professional level. Berenato said a journalist in

Seattle told her Zellous “still plays cool, smiles at - e _
the media and shakes everyone’s hands at press‘

conferences” the same way she did at Pitt.

A “A lot of times people are drafted, but they’re
never going to make anything of themselves
aiter they’re drafted. They realize, ‘Oh, that

‘was my goal’ and they just settle,” Berenato

said. “Well, Shavonte has now gone to the next
level.” ' ,

Although Zellous is adjusting well during her
rookie season in the WNBA, she still notices dif-
ferences between the college and professional
games. For one, she said the WNBA is more
physical than the collegiate level.

“You’re dealingwith veterans who have been
around the league for three and ﬁve and nine
years, and they know the game. You’re fresh out
of college, so they label youas arookie so tl1ey’re
going to come after you,” Zellous said.

Berenato" said she had. the opportunity to
watch Zellous play in person this season, in-
cluding the June 8 game at Detroit when the
Shock received ‘their’ world championship
rings. Zellous started that game and was the

ﬁrst rookie to start a season-opener for the

You may be eligible to participate if you: ' Shock Since 2Oo3_

“It was really wonderful to see the excite-
ment around that, because we hope to win a
national championship [at Pitt] ,” Berenato said.
“[Zellous] is just really blooming andIthinkPitt
really took care of her for life in the WNBV .”

Zellous’ success is important for the Pitt
women’s basketball, Berenatosaid, adding
that players often have two goals when they
come to college: to get a’ degree and to play in
the league. ' '

“Now, at Pitt, we can say that you will get
a degree from one of the top institutions and
we can get you to the league, becauseshavonte
was drafted and she’s been hugely successful,”
Berenato said.
