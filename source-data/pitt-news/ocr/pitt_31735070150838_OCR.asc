Editor’s note: Last week, Student

Gmzemment Board Elections Com- ‘

mittee Chairman Aaron Gish ﬁled
an infraction complaint against
SGB President Gordon Louderback
that mentioned Board members afl
ﬁliated with a student group known
as the Druids. Because the Druids
are a secret society,’ little is knovim
on campus about the ‘organization
or its members. ‘

This is the second of a two—part
series by The Pitt News looking into
who the Druids are and what they
do at Pitt. Part Two examines the
increased political activity of the
Druids in recent years and the com-
plications that have resulted.

When Gordon Louderback ranfor the
presidency of Student Government

Board in November — a race he Won -

by a comfortable margin — he said
that ‘.‘any student really does have
the ability to change Pitt’s campus.”

“To me, that’s something that I
want to make available to every stu—
dent.'Because,_ as of now, [SGB] is
really closed in and sort of a closed
family,” the future president said

in’ an interview shortly before the

election. “To have the ability for all '
' students to beneﬁt from it — which

we’re meant to do, ‘we represent the

student body — is really important _

to me.”

But this year, ‘six of the nine stu-
dents elected to the Board, which is
responsible for allocating the more
than $2.3 million of the Student Ac-
tivities Fund, shared membership
in the same student group before
winning their seats —— although that
information wasn’t listed in their
campaign biographies.

Louderback and Board members
Thornasjabro, C.J. Bonge, Sarah Wm-
ston,]ohn Cordier and Sowmya Sana-
pala are all members of the Druids, a
society of active students on campus
whose members have kept their iden-
tities asecret since the rnid-1990s. Of
these six, allbut Sanapala ran on the
Fifth and ‘Forbes megaslate headed
by Louderback.

The Druids have often done good
deeds around campus in the past and
— albeit robed in black hoods —
have engaged in anonymous acts
of kindness throughout their long
history. .

The small group itself also com-
prises avaried spectrum of involved

students from across campus.
Among the Druids on SGB, Cordier
is a Pitt soccer player, Jabro is a Pitt
Pathﬁnder, Winston is a member of
Hillel, Sanapala is aformer president
of the Indian Sub-Continent Asso-
ciation and Louderback is deeply
involved with PALS, the Pitt Asso-
ciation for Leadership and Success.
But although the group has in-
cluded student government leaders
since its earliest years, the exclusive
society’s increasing overlap with

members of SGB has beenviewed by ‘

some —- including former members
of the secret group .— as detrimental

' to the transparency and diversity of

the student body.

Rosie McKinley, former president ‘
of the Pitt Pathﬁnders and also afor- «
mer Druid, echoed the sentiments of ,

two other society initiates when she
stated after the November 2012 SGB
election that she was worried about
the group’s political ambitions.

“I-think there’s real value in stu— '

dents getting involved on campus,”
McKinley said. “The Druids have
instead used [their group] as a way
to form a secret clique, which-has
helped, Ithink, signiﬁcantly in the
last two elections to impact the way
the election turns out.” ‘ ‘ ’ '

The Druids get political

The Order of the Druids is one of
Pitt’s oldest student organizations.
However, the society isn’t officially
recognized through the Student Or-
ganization Resource Center. Created
inthe 1920s as a sophomore honors
fraternity, the now-secret society is
historically known for recognizing
students’ achievements on campus.

But according to several former_
Druids, the group has recently under-
gone some drastic changes, lessen-
ing its focus on encouraging other
student leaders and becoming more
intent on electing its own to Pitt’s
student govemmentwhile remaining

shrouded in anonymity.

McKinley, who left the group in
the fall of 2012 because of disagree-
ments with other members, believes
the Druids are exerting undue inﬂu-
ence on SGB politics. She recalled the
experience of her ﬁrst meeting as a
member of the society in October
2011 after having been “tapped” —
or initiated — into the group about
two months prior to the SGB election
that year. -

“The ﬁrst meeting after my initia-
tion was all about gettingjames Lan-
dreneau elected president,” she said.

Landreneau, who was elected the
2012 SGB president that November,
conﬁrms McKinley’s memory, but
said he remembers disagreeing with
the group’s political agenda. Landre-
neau also left the Druids in fall 2012
after a disagreement with members

- over the group’s mission.

“That probably is right. This is
right around the same time I began
to lead meetings,” Landreneau said,
referring to his oﬂicial role as grand
executioner, or discussion leader, of
the society. .

“Someone made that comment
[about getting Landreneau elected],
and I said, ‘I really appreciate you
saying we should support [me], but
that’s not what we’re here 'for.”’

According to multiple sources,

' Pitt Drum Major Paul Bowers has

since taken over the role as grand
executioner of the group.

The Druids have typically always
included one or two SGB members
over the years. .

Thomas Bailey, a" Druid in the
early ’70s, was president of an earlier
iteration of the current SGB. Kevin
Washo, SGB president from 2002 to
2003, was also known to be a mem-

Investment
committee
extends
spending policy

Pitt’s Board of Trustees Investment Com-
mittee approved a resolution Wednesday
morning in Posvar Hall that will extend the
current spending policy for the University’s
endowment fund.

Under the new resolution, the income

percentage from University-owned inves_t—. _

ments will remain at 4.25 percent, bringing
the “three-year average fair market value of

the assets” to approximately $3.81 per share

for the 2014 ﬁscal year. Pitt ﬁnancial officers
recommended this resolution.
Each year, the Investment Committee

meets to decide what spending policy they ‘

will follow for Pitt’s endowment fund. The
University endowment consists of all dona-
tions made to the University for a speciﬁc
cause — such as funding scholarships or fel-
lowships — based on the wishes of the donor.

For example, an alumnus of the engineering '
school could donate money toward providing

engineering students free calculators.
According to the spending policy, the
committee has the'option of distributing
4.25 percent of the three-year average fair
market value of the assets or distribute the
prior year’s income distribution. The path
that provides greater value is theone the
committee chooses. ,
Originally approved by the Investment
Committee during a meeting on Sept. 17,
2012, the policy also states that “in no event
shall any such income distribution be less
than 2 percent, nor more than 7 percent, of
the three-year average fair market value of
the assets, determined on a per-share basis.”
The principal investment.isn’t used by the
University and is instead invested in various"
assets. Interest from the principal invest-
ment goes toward funding the project that
the donor formulates. At the end of the 2012
ﬁscal year, Pitt’s endowment was worth $2.62
billion — up from $2.53 billion in 2011 —
according to Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele.

ber of the secret society.

According to Dave Gau, a former under-
graduate student at Pitt and alcurrent doctoral
student in engineering, Charlie Shull, the Inter-
fraternity Council president and SGB president
in 2010, was a Druid. Gau himselfwas a Druid
when he served on the Board alongside Shull.
Both were tappedin2008. e

. Molly Stieber, the SGB president following
Shull in 2011, was not a member of the Dru-
ids. But at least_three of Stieber’s other board
members -— Ryan G_ayman,'Emily Hoover and
James Landreneau — were.‘ u
Landreneau’s Board consisted of Druids,

cording to McKinley. _

McKinley said the Druids played an active
role in Landreneau’s presidential victory and
in getting Murdoch and Louderback onto the
Board, but she thinks the group’s political am-'
bitions have grown exponentially since then.

Gau, who followed the 2012 SGB election
and helped run the campaign of Louderback’s
opponent, Natalie Rothenberger, said he also
noticed the political trend developing.

“When Charlie Shullwas  we didn’t
say, ‘Alright, we need to make sure Charlie wins,
tell your friends,”’ Gau said. . ._

Landreneau, who said he wanted to runfor
SGB prior to even beingtapped into the Druids,

backing ofthe Druids duringhis2011 campaign.

Although the society is a relatively small
student group composed of only about 20
students, the Druids’ membership touches all

as well — Louderback and Alex Murdoch, ac- —

admitted he still took advantage of the secret V

comers of campus _and_creates a broad base

’ for networking — but without most students

knowing when they come into contact with a
member of the society. , ' ’

“It’s impacting the election without peo-
ple on the outside knowing what’s going on,”
McKinley said. “It just seems undemocratic. If

we’re operating in what claims to be a demo- u

cratic process, electing SGB leaders, then it
should be naturally transparen ”

The 2012 SGB election
The Druids continued actively supporting
a presidential, candidate in the most recent
SGB election. ' . _
In November 2012, Louderback defeated

‘Rothenberger. His megaslate, Forbes and Fifth

— the group of candidates with whom he ran
for Board — swept theelection, with all of‘

' its six members winning seats on the nine_—

member Board. -
‘I Only two members of Rothenberger’s Steel
and Stone megaslate, Mike Nites and current
Druid Sowmya Sanapala, were elected to the
Board. Dave Rosenthal, who ran on the three-
person Pitt United slate, also won a seat.
McKinley said the Druids’ role in the 2012
election was different than in previous years.
The Druids effectively ran the Forbes and
Fifth megaslate, on which ﬁve of the six candi-
dates were members in the secret society. Kate

Malekoff, a member of the Druids since 2011, .
was ‘campaign manager, serving as the chief '

organizer and contactfor campaignvolunteers
and oflicial business. I ' _
Similar to McKinley’s 2011 election—season
experience, an anonymous Druid present at
an October 2012 group meeting felt that the
conversation was dominated by Bowers’ and

     

Malekoff’s discussionof how to get Druids
elected to the Student Government Board.
“They were just talking about getting
elected to SGB and drawing ‘D’s around cam-
pus,” the source, who requested anonymity
to avoid group ridicule for coming forward,
said. “They talked about [other activities] for
like, one minute.” . A
McKinley’s assessment of the Druids’ “se—
cret clique” impacting the elections revolves

, around the reality of SGB elections, which are
widely viewed as contests based on social’ net-

works, rather than issues.‘ As SGB candidates
campaigr’1,.they use a combination of paper
_campaigning, campaign speeches to garner en-
dorsements from student groups and election-

" day fanfare to increase turnout at the polls.

Endorsements are generally the most im-
portant aspect of campaigningfor candidates.
Access to a large student group’s email con-
tacts, known colloquially as a distribution list
or “D—list,” gives campaigns a large podium

from which to distribute their messagesvia -

email on voting day. V .
Accordingto Gau, candidateswinby mobi-
 networks, and “the Druidsare probably
the easiestto organize.”
“It will always be a popularity contest,” he

-V said.
Gau graduated in2011, elfe'c11'vely endinghis ‘

tenure as a Druid, although he hasn’t strayed
far from student government politics at Pitt. He
currently serves as president of Pitt’s Gradu-
ate and Professional Student Government and
‘helped Rothenberger with her SGB campaign
as an unofﬁcial campaign manager, .
“She’s my friend, [she] asked for help. How

could I say no?” he said via text. “I helped Nata-
lie before the drama began. I think me helping
Natalie aggravated the Druid drama. I was dis-
appointed that they made anyone associated
with me after that point a villain, such as what
happened to James.”

Landreneau agreed that being seen as sup-
porting Rothenberger was problematic when
interacting with the Druids. ‘

“A lot of people in the group did not like Nat-
alie,” he said. He explained that many members
in the society became hostile to him because of
his relationship with Rothenberger," despite the
fact that, because of his role as SGB president
at the time, he did not support either campaign
during the election. Landreneau was also close
friends with Louderback at the time.

McKinley describes the Druids as “an in-
organic connection” between student leaders.
Both Gau and McKinley argue that the group’s
presumed secrecy is an advantage in SGB poli-
tics. Access to the secret network is closed to
anyone not tapped into the organization, and,
according to McKinley, decisions about mem-
bership have recently been made with politics
in mind.

Landreneau thinks Forbes and Fifth may
have used the prestigeof the group to their
advantage.

Landreneau said Louderback may have or-
ganized his megaslate, Forbes and Fifth, based
on who maybe in the Druids in the future, with
the possible intention of forging both political
and fraternal alliances. V

“Some people felt that he, with respect to.
Gordon, had chosen people [for his slate] that .

he knew would get into the group,” Landre-
neau said.

While the incidence of a few Druids on the
Board seems to have been common, Gau main-
tains that no one was ever tapped into the orga-
nization forpolitical purposes during his time.

“Normally, we never tapped while they were
running,” Gau said. '

But Landreneau argues that Louderback and
Malekoff, prominent members of the Druids
and of the Forbes and Fifth campaign, used their
unrevealed network in the campaign.

I Landreneau said he believed the two were
“using their connections to downplay Steel and
Stone and whoever they were against.”

But the source of animosity between the
two megaslates, Forbes and Fifth and Steel and

Stone, as well as the growing discontent within V

the Druids, leads back to an interpersonal con-
flictbetween members of the secret society and

' Rothenberger.

Leaving the Druids

While the student government politics

started to heat up, so did the politics within
the Druids. _ N" .

McKinley left the Druids after a disagree-
ment with current members over the SGB
election. It began during the summer as then-
Board members Rothenberger and Louderback
began positioningthemselves forapresidential
campaign.

McKinley said that, in late September, Me-
gan Elliot, programming chairwoman of the

OCC Honorary Society and a member of the
Druids, nominated Rothenberger to be tapped
into the group. According to McKinley, Male-
koff and Louderback objected. .

“I asked flat out —— why not?” Mckinley
recalled.

McKinley said Malekoff objected because it

“would threaten the brotherhood of the group.” .

Louderback agreed with Malekoff, accord-
ing to McKinley. When McKinley asked Louder-
back at the time if his objection to Rothenberger
was because they were SGB opponents, Loud-
erback said yes, also according to McKinley.

V The Pitt News attempted to contact Loud-
erbacklmultiple times regarding McKinley’s
comments, but the SGB president declined to
answer any questions. In a text message to a

reporter, he said, “There’s no way I have any-

thing to say about that completely ﬁction[al]
story. It shows how reliable your sources are.”
Malekoff also declined to comment on

the story after multiple attempts at setting up '

interviews, and she said in a text message to

a reporter that she didn’t “wish to have any‘
‘ relationship with The Pitt News.” ‘

Elliot also didn’t respond to attempts’ to
contact.

McKinley said she leﬁ; the group when
Louderback supporters used the secrecy of
the Druids as a political advantage.

“I thought [Natalie] and Gordon were equal
candidates, but I didn’t like that Gordon had an
unfair advantage because he was in the Druids,
because it gave him access to all sorts of people,”
she said, referring to the networks the Druids
members tapped into to garner votes.

Landreneau left the group in late October
2012 because he was dissatisﬁed with the en-
vironment. ' .

“You had to hand—pick who your friends
were and not leave that bubble,” Landreneau

’ said, indicating that the atmosphere repre-

sented a shift from when he ﬁrst joined.
At one point, he said, he felt like he couldn’t

, escape the Druids beingintertwined with many
aspects of his life at Pitt. Landreneau compared ‘

the group atmosphere to a fraternity, but said
that its purpose shouldn’t be friendship.
“It’s not a fraternity. It’s not meant to be

like that. A level of friendship ﬁne, but it’s not

ahidden sect.” 2

‘Instead, Landreneau thinks the group’s pur-
pose should be two-fold.

First, he argued, the main purpose was in-
tended to beto “recognize individuals or groups
on campus who are doing great things.” Second,
Landreneau said, the network of the Druids
can be a powerful tool to improve campus and
inspire students via leadership.

McKinley, who didn’t have any SGB experi-
ence prior to joining the Druids, but eventually
applied and was selected to work on the 2012
Allocations Committee, said she initially stayed
in the Druids after the surprisingly political
experience of her ﬁrst society meeting, hoping
that the group would develop into something
else. .

Unfortunately, Landreneau said, the Dru-
ids seem to have lost track of the goals of the
organization. ’

“Ijustthink you have to be conscious of why
you’re part of this group,” Landreneau said. “It’s

The Druids on campus

Following the SGB election, The
Pitt News obtained a list of the cur-
rent Druids, many of whom play or
have played some sort of role in stu-
dent government.

The listhas been cross-referenced
with multiple sources, including
Gau and McKinley. But because the
Druids are a secret society, The Pitt

News has no way of knowing if this _

list contains the names of every cur-
rent Druid.

In addition to the six members
on the Student Government Board,
Druids Shivani Patel and Mimi Frisch
serve as members of the SGB Alloca-
tions Committee. Other members of
the society include Nick Stamatakis,
the assistant opinions editor for The
Pitt News, and Grand Executioner
Bowers, the Pitt Band drum major.

The Pitt News contacted each of
the 18 individuals on the list. Most
did not retum reporters’ calls or
emails, and those who did either
declined to comment or denied be-

. ing part of the group.

When asked if she wanted to
comment on her involvement with

the Druids, Board member Sarah
Winston responded, “No, not really.”

Former Allocations Committee —

member Zach Harr said via text, “I’m
sorry, but I wouldn’t be able to offer
you any knowledge on the subject,”
when asked about the evolution of
the Druids.

Stamatakis declined to comment
on his affiliation with the group, and
Murdoch denied being involved with
the society. - .

. Mike Osterrieder, a member of
the Pitt band, said, “I’m not sure
where you got this information from,
but I’m not a Druid, nor do I know
much of anything about them.”

An untransparent future
As the semesterwinds down, SGB
only has one public meeting left in
this academic year to address the
student body.
' This Tuesday, the Board took the
opportunity to discuss some of their

achievements, including Louderback '

securing the installation of wireless
Internet in the dorms this summer
and Sanapala establishing a part-
nership with the Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force to provide prophylactics
to student groups through Student
Health Services. _

in recent memory up until this point
in their terms, it’s clear the Druid

inhibited the group’s productivity.
Both Druid members and non-Druids
alike on the Board have taken signiﬁ-
cant positive steps toward improving

- student well—being and campus life

at Pitt.
The problem most critics of the
Druid presence on SGB see, however,

is not in their activities on the Board, ~

but the fact that student voters didn’t
know they had elected a group of
ofﬁcials who were secretly aligned
through an exclusive society. p
“It creates this inorganic connec-
tion between people who would oth-
erwise not be connected,” McKinley
said. “It isn’t transparent in any way.”
The issue was ﬁnally brought to

The Druicis emailed thishoiiday card to SORC-certified organizations on

 

light on March 31, when SGB Elec-
tions Committee Aaron Gish ﬁled
an infraction against Louderback
regarding what Gish claimed to be
Louderback infringing on the Elec-
tion Comrnittee’s autonomy. Gish’s

‘ infraction complaint indicated that

Louderback had accused the com-
mittee chair ofbias after Gish — who
was in the process of revising the SGB
Elections Code at the time —— had
made comments about the Druids’
presence in SGB.

’ The complaint resulted in a hear-
ing, and the SGB]udicial Committee

‘ found Louderback guilty of exert-

ing undue inﬂuence on the Elections
Committee on April 4.

 

Louderback said at Tuesday’s SGB
meeting that he hopes to continue to
work with Gish to have a successful
year of SGB activities. Following the
ﬁling of the infraction, he still refused
to comment on the mention of his
affiliation with the Druids. S

Landreneau, despite his leaving
the group, said he believes the Druids
have done great things on campus
and that they still have the potential
to do so. But, he said, there is a ﬁne
line between being a Druid and being
involved in SGB.

“The line between'SGB and the
Druids should be so thick that it’s
almost inescapable, like you can’t
hop over it,” Landreneau said. “If
someone in the group wants to run
for Board, that’s great. But it should
also not be incentive  to run for
Board.”

, Landreneau said he doesn’t think
the line is that thick for all current
Board members. ‘ 7

“No one should be picked [to run
for Board] just because they’re your
best friend. I think you can look at
last fall and pinpoint which individu-

g als were purposefully doing tha ,”

Landreneau said.
“There’s a reason why ﬁve or six
of those people are on Board.” I

Pitt must make divestment
from fossil ﬁiels a priority

Tracey Hickey 5

~ Columnist

Last week, a leaking pipeline
caused two unrelated oil spills in
Arkansas and Texas. In Arkansas,
nearly 20,000 barrels of crude oil
flowed from a burst Exxon Mobil
pipeline into a residential area

about 25 miles from Little Rock,

Ark. In Texas, a Shell pipeline
leaked anywhere between 60
and 700 barrels into a bayou that
runs from Houston to the Gulf of
Mexico. ‘ - -

In both cases, the oil giants re-
sponsible have been cagey: Exxon
Mobil representatives promised to
cover cleanup costs in Mayﬂower,
Ark., yet they continue to report
the amount of the spill at less than
a quarter of the town authorities’
estimate. In Texas, Shell insisted
that inspectors found no leak in
the Texas pipeline until the Coast
Guard revealed that a spill oc-

curred.

While not on the scale of the BP
oil spill catastrophe, these acci-
dents reveal that there is a general

trend of oil companies dodging

regulations and dragging their feet
on cleaning up their messes at the
risk and expense of the people liv-
ing in their communities.

Even more troublingly, these
‘spills exemplify a broader issue:
Even when every aspect of fossil
fuel production and consumption
goes exactly according to plan,
burning coal, oil and natural gas
pollutes the air and contributes
to climate change.

. And because Pitt invests in fos-
sil fuel companies, our institution
is part of the problem.

I don’t know exactly how much
Pitt has invested in fossil fuels ver-
sus how much we invest in clean
energy because Pitt is not very
transparent with students about
their investments, but I do know

that Pitt has money.i-nvestedgvin-—

fuels. Our neighbor, Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, is one of these colleges. According
to Pitt seniorjustin Lozano, president and
founder of Pitt Greenpeace and a leading
advocate for divestment on campus, the fos-
sil fuel divestment movement is “spreading
like wildfire.”

“We really believe that Pitt has the poten-

tial to become a leader in the clean energy.

movement, just_like CMU,” Lozano said.
“Fossil fuels are not sustainable or clean and
they perpetuate climate change, and divest-
ment from that will help address threats that
we pose to our air, water and land.”

However, Pitt hasn’t been entirely eco-
unfriendly: In April 2012, Pitt was added to
the Princeton Review’s Guide to 322 Green
Colleges. Yet, as more of our neighbors who
are also featured on that list take the leap to
divest from fossil fuels, we fail to adequately
assess the larger issue. Whileit’s simply
unfeasible to immediately stop using fossil
fuels, we need to begin gradually divesting
immediately, not just for the environment
and the health and welfare of our neighbors,
but for our own future;

After all, “sustainable” isn’t just a catchy
buzzword. It means that an environmen-
tal practice can continue. Fossil fuels are
unsustainable, not only because they are
huge polluters but because there is a finite
supply of them. Investing in fossil fuels is an
exercise in prioritizing short—term reward
over long-term stability. We can do better.

LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

Today’s article in The Pitt News concern-
ing the Druids is the result of months of re-
search and interviews by multiple report-
ers and editors. The newspaper wanted to
provide a thorough account of the history
of the Druids from their early beginnings
to their current state.

In the process, The Pitt News learhed
that one of its own staff members, Assis-
tant Opinions Editor Nick Stamatakis, is a
member of the Druids...

» All members of The Pitt News are re-
quired to disclose any organizations they
are affiliated with, and Stamatakis did not
inform The Pitt News of his involvement
with the Druids because of the organiza-
tion’s secrecy. His lack of disclosure vio-
lated our Code of Ethics.

Afterthe discovery about Stamatakis’
affiliation with the secret society, it imme-
diately came to The Pitt News’ attention
that he penned the endorsement editorial
supporting Gordon Louderback in his bid
for Student Government Board president,
which Louderback succeeded in winning.

The Pitt News editorial board is com-
posed of all of the editors listed in the staff
box published each day, and the edito-

rial represents the joint opinion of all of.

those editors on behalf of The Pitt News.
Stamatakis wrote the persuasion of the

"editorial board, whose members reached

the majority opinion that they supported

Louderback at the time. However, had The
Pitt News known that Stamatakis was a

member of the Druids, the editorial board

would have barred him from writing the
editorial in the interest of avoiding a per-
ceived conflict of interest.

Stamatakis’ previous columns have
been reviewed for any potential conﬂicts
in which he would be supporting any cur-
rent fellow Druids. No conﬂicts have been
discovered at this time. However, as any
additional information surfaces regarding
the Druids, The Pitt News will examine his

columns again and add any notes that will A '

explain the conﬂict. .

Stamatakis did not deny his affiliation
with the Druids when I asked him about it.
Stamatakis has been banned from writing
critical pieces concerning SGB as a colum-
nist and as assistantopinions editor when
writing editorials. He has accepted these
terms while The Pitt News continues to
employ him.

Unfortunately, this conﬂict of inter-
est was not detected sooner, and The Pitt
News will re—examine‘ its policy of how
reporters read and understand the Code
of Ethics. I apologize on behalf of The Pitt
News for any perceived conﬂicts of inter-
est this incident has generated.

Rocks like: A therapy session

,Tyler,The Creator releases his third album

with a self-conscious tone.

Jeff Ihaza
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

There is an endless amount of noise surround-
ing Los Angeles—based rap collective Odd Fu-
ture Wolf Gang Kill Them All. Their consistent
use of vitriolic language regarding gay people
and women has baffled critics, especially given
Frank Ocean’s beautiful and heartfelt coming-
out letter on Tumblr last summer.

Odd Future member Earl Sweatshirt" even
attracted attention from the highbrow maga-
zine The New Yorker, which published a rather
extensive piece about his stay at a Samoan

camp fortroubled youth last year. Then of

course, there is the group’s late—night comedy
show “Loiter Squad,” now in its second season

. on Adult Swim.

At the crux of all of this is 21-year-old Tyler
Okonma, betterknown as Tyler, The Creator,
who in 2009 shook the very foundation of rap
music with his debut album, Bastard. The
album was both troubling andbeautiful in
its expression of anger andfrustration with
being an outcast and growing up in a broken
home. The’title track ended with the power-
fully honest line “F*ck a deal, I just want my
father’s email‘/ So I can tell him how much I
f”"ckin’ hate him in detail.”

‘ There has never been any doubt that a
tremendous once-in-a—generation talent was

‘present among these kids, and after a rela-

tively long period of silence, Tyler returns with
his third album, Wolf, to remind the world
exactly why there’s‘ never any doubt.
Lyrically, Wolfis far too self-conscious for a
third album. Tyler consistently takes shots at

. critics who claim the groups 15 minutes are up,'_
and he even returns to a lot of the homophobic

language that marred his early releases.
This shouldn’t come as a surprise to any-
one who follows the group closely. Part of
the reason Odd Future remains the most in-
teresting and exciting act in music is the fact
that there isn’t an ounce of professionalism in
their work. As Tyler raps on his new album’s
seventh track, “Slater”: “I ain’t ask for this, I

' did it out of boredom.”

Despite a TV deal,owning a record label
and being the catalyst for a generation-deﬁn-
ing album in Channel Orange, Tyler remains

. ambivalent about his fame, making the moves

that he wants to make as opposed to the ones
that sell. . '

' That’s the reason Wolf isn’t much of a rap
album. Outside of the uncharacteristically
mature “48,” “Answer” and “IFHY,” none of
the subject matter on Wolfis particularly sur-
prising. Tyler admitted to being bored with
rap in one of his legendary Twitter rants, and
it shows in every line of his album.

Instead, Tyler quite masterfully uses this
persona to sell his magniﬁcent production
on the record. Starting with the album’s title

COLUMN

James Franco
has fun with
his public
image

John Lavanga
For The Pitt News

One minute James Franco is America’s Re-
naissance man, writing poetry to commemo-
rate President Barack Obama’s second term;
writing the screenplay for, directing and
acting in the adaptation of William Faulkner’s
seminal novel, “As I Lay Dying;” and garner-
ing an Academy Award nomination for his
role in Danny Boyle’s breathtaking ﬁlm “127
Hours.”

The next minute, he is America’s stoner

clown, playing the giggling Saul Silver in

“Pineapple Express,” botching his night as
the host of the Oscars and then laughing
about it with Stephen Colbert in the role of

' his twin brother, “Frankjameso.” .

It’s a confusing dichotomy that the view-
ing public and Franco’s critics have struggled
with throughout his weird ride to the top of
Hollywood. At some points, he has come un-
der ﬁre for his supposedly egotistical artistic
enterprises, the main thought being that his
pursuit of multiple master’s degrees in ﬁction
writing and ﬁlm, as well as his Yale Ph.D. are
just a way for. Franco to validate his artistic
abilities and keep the spotlight on himself.

At other times, especially while hosting
the Oscars, he’s accused of gooﬁng off, taking
his craft less seriously than he should and
wasting his artistic talents on cheap comedic
pursuits and weed humor. It’s a split opinion
on whether he is “james Franco: self-indul-
gent artist,” or “James Franco: lazy goof-off.”

The fact of the matter is that he’s both.
More importantly, he’s an actor who re-
fuses to believe that he has any particular
responsibility to the public. Instead, he has
recognized that his fame, combined with his
talent, gives him the ability to ostensibly do
whatever he wants, provided he’s ready to be
criticized for whatever it is that he wants to
do. He’s the rare actor who’s willing to make
a complete fool of himself and play with his
image in his art.

In an era when celebrities are under the
scrutiny of the public eye and every mistake
and poor decision they make draws harsh
criticism, Franco makes a game out of toying
with the public’_s perception of him. In an
interview with Bullett magazine, he reﬂected
on the fun he has with the perception.

“Maybe a part of it has to do with self-

obsession. But it’s also about using this weird -

thing that is a public persona as raw material
for creative projects,” he said.

Consider his role in the soap opera “Gen—
eral Hospital.” For the role, he had two re-

Hipster culture finds itself at a crossroad

Natalie Benoy
If/PTS Corztributor

As it turns out, nobody actually identiﬁes
as a hipster. '

If one were to ask the average ﬂannel-
wearing, thick-rimmed-glasses-sporting

individual easily foundamong the stacks .

at a local record store if he identiﬁes as a
hipster, chances are the answer would be no.
Unlike the behavior of most social groups,
the hipster feels the need to psychologically
distinguish his actions from those of others
in his group in order to preserve his unique
sense of self. The hipster represents a group
of people whom we all love to hate.

The hipster cultural phenomenon is one
that prides itself on its ability to evolve and
change at a breakneck pace. What is new and
hip in one moment loses its relevance in a

timespan of only a few weeks, often less. .

How_does a cultural movement to which
change is so fundamental respond to threats
to its own set of social norms?

As the hipster social phenomenon
spreads further into popular culture every
year — from the inﬂuence of stores such
as Urban Outfitters and American Apparel
allowing everyday consumers to buy their
way into the hipster culture to blogs such
as Pitchfork and Gorilla vs. Bear gaining
more and more web traffic each day —- the

hipster culture is forced to do what it does
best: change, or ﬁnd itself permanently sub-
merged in the mainstream.

What is perhaps most ironic is that the
aforementioned self—branded “indie” com-
panies have been doing this for years. Pitch-
fork, the major online indie music taste-
maker, originally got its start back in 1993.

_Popular clothing giant American Apparel

_ partnered with record labels Barsuk, Merge
and Sub Pop in 1997, and Urban Outﬁtters
ﬁrst released its exclusive monthly playlist
selections with Insound in the fall of 2 000.
For nearly two decades, the indie hipster
culture manifested itself as a commercial-
ized marketplace myth, and the connection
.has never been more apparent than it is
today. Though it seems ironic that a culture
so obsessed with the concept of irony ﬁnds
in itself a deﬁnition, there is much more to
contemporary hipster subculture than just
cutting—edge music and skinny jeans.

Historically, the hipster really ﬁrst put ‘
itself on the map in the form of black urban 7

counterculture, lauded by some as a speck
of authenticity within the white suburban
conformist sprawlof the late ’50s. From its
humble beginnings, the hipster, in time,

and through various iterations, grew to in--

clude all sorts of societal miscreants, from
left-wing radicals to misunderstood athe-
ists to jobless liberal arts majors who found

Quirky? Certainly. But deserving of our
hatred, loathing and disdain? Perhaps not.

Where did the hipsters go wrong in their
quest for the great escape from cultural
uniformity? The answer largely lies in eco-
nomics. Modern—day hipsters most often
come from middle-- to upper—middle-class
upbringings, carrying along with their ac-
cessto funds a sense of entitlernent.’The
misguided belief that society owes hipsters
something, while at the same time they need
not contribute anything in return, leads
modern-day hipsters down the path of ruin.
It has become a culture often concerned with
sustainability while living a lifestyle that is,
in the long run, unsustainable. _

So what can we salvage from this primor-~
dial soup of social elitism, constant contra-

. dictions and all too many empty cans of PBR?

Fortunately, the hipsters’ exten-
sive experience with irony leaves them

with the ‘ability to evaluate them-“

rapalbum. Rudimentary chord progressions
and annoying bastardizations of southern
“trap” sounds are replaced with lush piano‘
melodies and complex bridges that, regard-
less of your views about Tyler as a rapper, are
undeniably pretty. .

The album’s shining moment comes on
“48,” a moving ballad about the crack epi-
demic in the black community wrapped in a
metaphor about rap music that features not

only a spoken-word sample of Nas but also a A

equally moving “Crack'Rock” from Channel '

it will come off as the whining of a now-rich

Franco: goofball, artist, Renaissance man.

quirements: His character had to be aper-
formance artist, and his character had to be
insane. The character he played was a serial
killer artist named Franco. He then turned
around and repurposed footage from the
show and used it as the basis for an eerie ﬁlm
titled “Francophrenia,” in which an actor
(Franco) mixes up his soap opera persona

with his actual persona and becomes a se-

rial killer.

  
   

Franco has played games with the no-
tion that he’s lazy, as well. When he drew
the ire of UCLA students for backing out of

, his commencement speech at the univer-

sity just nine days prior to the ceremony,
he and the Harvard Lampoon made a video
mocking his cancellation and parodying the
public perception ofhim as a blundering,
egotistical actor.

In the video, a possibly inebriated Franco
goes off on a sardonic tirade about his great-
ness_as an actor and his incredible inﬂuence
on the gay rights movement, thanks to his
role in the ﬁlm “Milk.” He’s not only mocking
himself but also mocking the reverence our
culture gives actors.

At the moment, the most talked about
image of Franco is his appearance in his
newest ﬁlm, “Spring Breakers.” In the ﬁlm,
he swaggers around as absurd rapper Alien,
sporting cornrows and a shiny metal grill
that punctuates his sinister smile. To play
the role, he emulated the equally ridiculous
Houston rapper Riff Raff (so well, in fact,
that Riff Raff openly complained about the
resemblance). .

_ He totes guns, wears Hawaiian shirts and
embodies the ﬁ1m’s attempt to examine the
darkest parts of a hedonistic culture that
seeks out quick fun and good times, as well
as pop culture’s ridiculous image of what
that culture is.

In short, it’s Franco doing what he does
best — using performance and parody to
point out the absurdity of our perceptions.

for some of its eerily beautiful.shots of a post-

‘ apocalyptic London, all the while usingthe

zombie apocalypse as an exploration of what
exactly makes us human.

It’s this combination of tightly controlled
aesthetics, entertaining plot lines and depth
that makes Boyle’s ﬁlms so appealing. When
he produces a work that is heavy on the former
two elements but lacks the latter, as he does
in “Trance,” it’s a bit surprising, though not
entirely unpleasant.

“Trance” is Boyle’s strange, twisting, ut—‘

terly beautiﬁil ﬁision of a deeply layered psy-
chological thriller and a pulp—heavy British
crime ﬁlm. At less than two hours in length,
it’s packed with beautiful shots, intrigue and
mind—blowing reveals. One way of picturing
the result is this: if Guy Ritchie (of “Lock, Stock
and Two Smoking Barrels” fame) directed
“Inception,” the end result probably would

The story centers on Simon (played by a 

ﬂop—sweating_]ames McAvoy), theemployee
of an art auctioneer who decides to be the
inside man. in an art heist, teaming up with a
group of criminals led by coldhearted French-
man Franck (Vincent Cassel). The ﬁlm opens
with a narration of the modern world of art
theft, though it doesn’t matter much, because
the heist itself is over 20 minutes after the

narration.
Then comes the problem: During the heist,
Simon, who was supposed to make off with the

painting, sustains brain damage and is unable
to remember where he stashed it.

After attempting to torture the information
out of Simon, Franck and the gang eventually
turn to hypnosis as away out of the mess. Enter
Dr. Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson), who
catches on to the plan and begins working
with the criminals to extract the information
from Simon’s head. _

As the ﬁlm progresses, however, the linear
narrative breaks down into a series of far more

av

ﬂuid transitions back and forth between the  ‘V

imaginary worlds that Dr. Lamb creates in Si-
mon’s head, the memories of the heist and pre-
ceding incidents. Each-sequence raises more
questions than it answers until the viewer is
left questioning every character’s motives and

A who exactly is in control.

The unconventional structure in “Trance”
has ‘incredible beneﬁts for the aesthetics of the
ﬁlm. The ability to move intermittently be-
tween the imagined world in Simon’s head and
the real world allows Boyle the liberty to use all
of his skills as a ﬁlmmaker, creating beautiful

landscapes and strange, surreal experiences “

that would not be believable were they not in
Simon’s head. Furthermore, the highly styl-
ized nature of the ﬁlm — incorporating an
entrancing soundtrack and consistent color
schemes — makes it diﬂicult to know the
transition between illusion and reality.
Unfortunately, this same structure also
makes “Trance” something of a drag at times.

throughout the entirety of the ﬁlm, alternating ’
between the captive and the controller with
seamless ease.

In some ways, it’s abit too much. Her abil-
ity to reduce tough criminals to nervous little
boys doesn’t quite feel realistic, and her use
of sexuality as a manipulative tool feels ex-
tremely 'cliché. It’s as though Boyle wanted
to create a super—femme fatale for the 21st
century. Despite these hiccups, it’s Dawson’s
ability to maintain asense of calm, as though
she’s a therapist leading a counselinglsession,
that truly anchors the ﬁlm.

What shouldn’t be forgotten about “Trance”
is that it is, above all else, a pulp-crime ﬁlm.
In the end, many of the plot points fall back
to the basic tropes of the genre. The thugs are
thuggish, the nervous wreck of a protagonist
has a shockingly hard—nosed streak to him,
the mastermind is cold and distant but not
infallible and the femme fatale always has to
use sex as aweapon. '

Though Boyle does have quite a bit of fun
with the roles he makes these basic charac-
ters play, when the layers of fancy plot work’
are stripped away, he falls back -on the same
depthless archetypes that have been used for
decades. If taken as such, it’s an enthralling
experience. I ‘

  Panthers drop rain-Shortened game to Penn. State

a

Dave Uhrmacher
Stcyj" Wrz'ter

On Dollar Dog night at the Petersen Sports
Complex, thepPitt softball batting order
failed to «muster up enough runs to catch
up to a potent Penn State lineup during a‘
Wednesday-afternoon showdown. The Nit-
tany Lions relished the early-game oppor-
tunities presented, taking a 7-0 lead before
the conclusion of the second inning.

Sophomore ace Savannah, King was
yanked after just 1 2/3 innings of work as
the N ittany Lions’ (10-23, 1-7 Big Ten) bats
roared to life for ﬁve runs. Fellow sophomore

"" Alexa Larkin relieved King in the middle of

the second inning, followinga KailynJohn-
son home run that put Penn State up 5-0.

Facinga seven-run deﬁcit headed into‘

the bottom of the second inning, Pitt (14-
21, 3-7 Big East) sent all nine batters to the
plate during a ﬁve-run inning to climb back
into the contest. Senior Holly Stevens’ grand
slam accounted for four of the ﬁve runs dur-
ing the inning, as three walks loaded the
bases and fueled the Pitt comeback bid.
The bats for the Panthers cooled off in
“the middle innings as Penn State freshman
“ll/Iacyjones began to settle in on the bump.

The same could not be said for the Nittany .

Lions, as _]ohnson’s three-run home run in
the ﬁfth inning -— her second round-tripper
of the game — gave Penn State an 11-5 lead
that would prove to be enough run support
for the remainder of the game.

A seventh-inning solo home run from
Carly Thea would be the last run scored for
the Panthers on the day, as inclement weath-
er halted game one with Stevens at the plate.
The game was called ﬁnal after an hour—long

' rain delay with the Panthers dropping the

/("Keystone State showdown, 11-7.

Game two of the scheduled doubleheader
has been postponed.
The Panthers resume play on Friday,

April 13, when they travel to South Orange, '

N._]., to take on the Seton Hall Pirates in a

’wBig East weekend series. I

Tournament

For The Pitt News

Head coaching turmoil at the collegiate level
can be costly for any program.

The women’s tennis program was the lat-
est team forced to replace a head coach after
a surprising departure. A - 3

On Jan. 7, 'GeorgeDieffenbach -— the all-
time winningest coach in Pitt history with 318
wins — announced his sudden retirement,
prompting the'hire-V of then-assistant coach
Michaela Kissell-Eddins for the top job. ‘

Kissell-Eddins, who graduated from Mar-
shall University in 2011 with a career winning
percentage of .733, was reluctant to set high
expectations for her team at this stage.

I “As a competitor, I want to win every
match,’’ said the new head coach. “The most
important thing is that our kids have gotten
better individually, and if they keep doing that,
they’ll be able to achieve even more.”

Many players have been pleased with the A

job the young coach has done, including soph-
omore Amanda Wickman. She welcomed the
coaching change and commended the work
‘ of the new coach thus far. .. 5

“It was really good. We’ve been practicing
more, and with [Kissell-Eddins] we’ve been
able to learn new things,” she said. “I feel that
we’ve all improved ‘a lot.”

Wickman’s teammate and sister, Molly
Wickman, agreed.

“George was a more laid-back coach, and
was a really positive, overall nice guy,” the
sophomore standout said. “But our coach
[Kissell-Eddins] is young, and better under-
stands and adapts to the newer game style.”

0 After a solid 8-6 start that included the
program’s ﬁrst-evervictory over Rutgers Uni-

versity, the Panthers have been on a recent

GABLER STYLE

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Writer

After watching Monday night’s NCAA
men’s basketball national championship,
"-‘ I. wondered how Pitt can ever reach that
elite stage of the tournament. The Panthers
don’t shoot as well, don’t run as well and

aren’t quite as talented as Michigan and-

Louisville.
The only thing that Pitt had in common
with both national-title-game participants

was consistently bad free throw shooting '

— all three teams shot less than 70 percent

from the charity stripe this season.
Despite a clear disparity in talent, the

Panthers played both Michigan and Lou-

 

" isville close this season,.losing by ﬁite to

Michigan and by three to Louisville. 1’
Doesn’t that say something about head
coachjamie Dixon’s system --1 which most
Pitt fans despise? .
Michigan shot 52 percent against'Lou-
isville on Monday night. Pitt held the Wol-

- verines to 46 percent, including a miserable

 Dixon’ssystem allows Pitt to succeed against top teams

3-for—17from beyond the arc. _ ,

At the time, thetmedia -said that No. 4
Michigan was overrated, and that Pitt, un-
ranked at the time, was underrated. That
made sense. There was no other reason why
that groupof Panthers pshoulsdc-be hanging

with a legitimate top-ﬁve team.

A lowly Penn State team beat Michigan,
so I’d be willing to consider Pitt hanging
around with Michigan an anomaly if it
didn’t happen again when the Panthers
played Louisville.

This time, visiting the No. 12 Cardinals
in the KFC Yum! Center, Pitt played a ter-
rible game, shooting less than 44 percent
and missing 9 of the 12 free throws they
attempted.

"Despite that, Pitt was in it until the end
against the eventual Big East and national
champion Cardinals.

Simply put, Dixon’s system keeps his
team in games when its talent may be over-
matched. So why doesn’t it work in the
tournament? It’s the same size ball and

court, and the rim is still 10_feet off the -

ground — just like Gene Hackman showed
us in “Hoosiers.”

V Some say that Pitt needs a go-to scorer
for clutch moments, but look no further
than those same Cardinals to ﬁnd a team
that-could not hit a big shot late in games.

In close games, Peyton Siva and Russ.
Smith would battle- for the last shot. Siva

I would often take ill—advised shots before

the clock warranted, and Smith would go
down the court at 100 miles per hour before
losing the ball and often not even getting a
worthwhile shot off.

Others argue that Pitt doesn’t recruit as
much high-end talent as teams like Michi-
gan do.

NCAA player of the year and future NBA
lottery pick Trey Burke, was ranked 83rd
by ESPN coming out of high school and
was once committed to the Big Ten cellar-
dwelling Nittany Lions.

Somehow he turned into a future NBA
star, unlike Steven Adams —— ranked sixth
by the ESPN recruiting database — who
didn’t exactly dominate at Pitt in his one
year of collegiate competition.

The last critique, and the one most com-
monly used in the earlier months, is that
Pitt doesn’t play a tough enough out—of—
conference schedule.

Perhaps Pitt’s years with a go-to scorer,
top talent and decent out—of—conference
opponents have created a perfect storm of
scrutiny against the team and the system.

Fans and pundits who call for Dixon to
fully revamp his system 180 degrees need
to rethink that approach. It is a system that
has gotten Pitt to the NCAA tournament
nine out of his 10 seasons at the helm.

To win the NCAA tournament, you have
to make the NCAA tournament. If Dixon
ever sells out on his defensive and rebound-
ing approach in favor of relying on a go-to
scorer and wide~open style of play, then
Pitt will have to beat teams like Michigan
and Louisville at their own game instead
of forcing them to play “Pitt basketball.”

Critics might be right — Pitt’s style
might be the team’s problem. Unfortunately

,for Pitt’s opponents, it has been a problem

for them, too. ﬂ

skid, losing four straight matches since a vic-
tory over Robert Morris on March 23. .‘

Coming off losses to Marshall and to 38th-
ranked Virginia Commonwealth University,
Pitt had an important seven—day‘stretch but
failed to take advantage of the opportunity.

Last Wednesday, the squad fell to city ri-
val Duquesne by a 4-3 decision. Pitt split the
singles matches with the Dukes, as Amanda
Wickman, Molly Wickman and Kimmy Borza
picked up victories. However, Pitt only won
one of the three doubles matches — a victory
by Karma Parbhu and Kimmy Borza — giving
Duquesne the decisive doubles points and the
overall win.

This past Saturday, the Panthers hosted Big
East foe Cincinnati in their ﬁnal home match of
the season. The'Panthers dropped that match
by a score of 6-1, with their only victories being
a singles win for Molly Wickman and a doubles
victory for Taylor Washington and Borza.

On Senior Day for the Panthers, they were‘

unable to eke out a victory for the two seniors
on the roster, but they had nothing but praise
for seniors Gabrielle Catanzariti and Parbhu.

Catanzariti suffered a wrist injury in early
March that sidelined her for the remainder of
her senior year. Prior to the injury, she had
compiled an 8-1 doubles record with then-
doubles-partner Borza.

jured, especially during their senior year,”
Kissell—Eddins said. “Gabrielle has had a great
career at the University of Pittsburgh and I’m
sure she’ll do great in whatever she does next.”

Kissell—Eddins echoed those same thoughts
for the other senior on her roster, Parbhu.

‘‘I’ve had the privilege of knowing Karma
for the past semester,” she said. “She’s been
a great leader and has always given 100 per-
cent. It will deﬁnitely be a loss not having her
next year.” ~

Borza — who began playing doubles with
Parbhu after Catanzariti’s injury — concurred.

“It’s always tough at ﬁrst learning to play
with someone new, but I’ve really enjoyed
playing with Karma, as well,” said the junior
from Beaver, Pa.

The Panthers were supposed to take on
the Carnegie Mellon Tartans on Wednesday
