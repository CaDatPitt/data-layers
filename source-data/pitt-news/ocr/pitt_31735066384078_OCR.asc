. Two members of Sigma Chi
fraternity, arrested during a
warrant authorized police search of
their Bayard Street house last
weekend, face an Oct. 26 hearing
before a district magistrate.

According to magistrate Ken-
nedy Smith, the two are: Dayid
McCloskey, who lives at the Sigma
Chi house, 4724 Bayard St., and
who was arrested on charges of
possession of marijuana and
disorderly conduct; and Sigma 'Chi
president John Cica, of the same
address, who was charged with
disorderly conduct and maintaining
a public nuisance.

‘ ‘Two others were brought to my
ofﬁce,”Smith said, ‘but it was
decided that they not be charged.”

Meanwhile, University and frat-
ernity have concluded that an
alleged Federal \ surveillance of
Bayard Street fraternities, known to
some Greeks for months, is nothing
more than a fabrication given the

appearance of substance by a
former Bayard Street fraternity

member reportedly employed at

one time by the US _SepartmentLf .

External Evaluation Sparks

  

By  KUKUCKA
- Pitt News Staff Writer'_

In recent weeks the University
has been confronted by charges of
ethnic and racial discrimination in
its hiring practices of faculty
members.

The accusations have been filed

by Father Ivan Dornic, a Byzantine

Catholic priest
from St. Mac-
rina parish in
Monogahela.

.‘ Donic resi-

ion as teacher
and lecturer in
the Slavic lang-

uages department in protest over
the alleged discriminatory prac-
tices.

Dornic's accusations stem from a
document obtained by The Pitt
News. known as the “Gibian -
Mathewson report," which he

claims is being used by Faculty of

Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg for the speciﬁc purpose

ﬁring Slavic teachers employed

9‘ y Pitt. _

The report. entitled “An Eval-
uation of the Department of Slavic
Languages and Literatures,‘ Uni-

,. _versity of Pittsburgh,” was written -

 

by Rufus W. Mathewson, Jr.,
professor of Slavic languages and
literature at Columbia University,
and George Gibian, professor of
Russian literature at Cornell
University. It was submitted to Pitt
on July 10, 1973.

Gibian and Mathewson were
called in to investigate the
department of Slavic languages
and literatures at Pitt to evaluate,
in the reports words, “Hie quality
of the educational experience a
student undergoes in the depart-
ment. with the intellectual atmos-
phere generated by the faculty, and
with the way the department
‘represents’ Russian and other
Slavic cultures on the Pitt
campus."

Although the authors studied
several documents. and interviewed
many people associated with the
department, they spent only one
full day in Pittsburgh. and did not
interview the then-chairman of the
department. Nikolai Poltoratzky.

At the time of the report,
Professor Poltoratzky’s integrity as
chairman was under question,
according to Domic, ° and an
interview with him should have
been imperative in the course of
the report. ' I

vations, the department’s Russian
program. Russian was the only
language spoken, read, or studied
in classes. Gibian and Mathewson
believed this type of program was
unique but indicated ”it’s advant-
ages were matched by a more
compelling list of disadvantages.”

The report stated, “the study of
the language, especially speaking
it and writing it, consumes time
that should‘ be spend on the
mind-stretching question of schol-
arship and criticism any good
graduate program should be built
on. Forced to speak, write, and
think in a language he has
imperfect control over, the stu-
dent's intellectual age is reduced. ”

The report criticized the Slavic
department for restricting its
studies of Russian literature to
pre-World War I Russia, while
practically ignoring Marxist-dom-
inated Russia.

‘‘It is one thing to make an
academic speciality out of the
Silver Age,” the report said, “but
it is another thing to derive one’s
own intellectual guidance almost
exclusively from these archaic
and/or limited areas.”

The report blamed thechairman
of the department for this ﬂaw.

Editor's Note: The following is an excerpt from the Mathewson-Gibian report.

AN EVALUATION OF THE DEPARTMENT A
OF SLAVIC LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES,
UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Introduction: '

The members of the evaluation committee, Professors George Gibian of Cornell
University and Rufus W. Mathewson, Jr., of Columbia University, read several
documents before coming to Pittsburgh, including the department's entries in the
course catalogue, two descriptions of the Department prepared by its chairman,
Professor Nikolai Poltoratzky, for the Provost and for the University’s own
evaluation committee, and statistics on course registration. We spent two evenings
and one full day in Pittsburgh, in the course of which we talked with several mem-
bers of the administration, two faculty_ members in the Slavic, Department,
Professors Liudmilla Koehler and Ivan Elagin, a number of students in the depart-
ment, _both undergraduates and graduates, members of the University’s evaluation
committee, and other faculty members concerned with Russia and Eastern Europe

‘in history and the social sciences. We did not attend any classes or seminars,
exarmne the.Slavic collection in the library, or read any graduate essays or disser-
tations. It IS a matter of particularly deep regret that we did- not interview the
chaiman. (He was not in Pittsburgh). On our return home, we examined student
course evaluations, looked at two books by faculty members, Prof. Koehler’s study
of the Russian poet, Delvig, and Prof. Poltoratzky's collection of essays on Russian
emigre literature, and talked with others who had had experience with the Pitt
Department.

Our concern throughout has been with the quality of the educational experience a
student undergoes in the department, with the intellectual atmosphere generated by
the faculty, and with the way the department “represents” Russian and other Slavic
cultures on the Pitt campus. We have not looked into ﬁnancial viability, degree
production ﬁgures, or any other technical administrative questions.

Conclusion:

The department has a number of assets which shouldbe kept, even if altered. Its
policy of teaching in Russian is an obvious morale-builder and should be  to
the exact point that it does not interfere with the raised intellectual standards that
should be introduced as rapidly as possible. Professor Poltoratzsky’s special in-
terest in and knowledge of emigre literature is a distinct asset and should be
celebrated as a Pittsburgh strength, at the same time that it should be permitted to
dominate the department’s intellectual atmosphere.‘~'l‘hough we do not intend to
comment on all members of the faculty, Professor Elagin daerves special 
His creative engagement in literature is priceless. The students’ high evaluation of
his coursescoincides exactly with our own impression of him. Arkady Nebolsine
surely adds livelincss to the department's course offerings, particularly for no-
dergraduates, and should be very helpful in opening that “window to the West” the
department needs so badly. , '

Spawned By External Report

a

i'\

-. chairman.

(Continued from Page I)
“The Pitt-Poltoratzky frame of
reference seems musty. cramped.
and out-of-touch.”

Overall. the report stated the
Slavic department is “isolated”
and unresponsive to change.

In its conclusion. the report cited
the department's Russian program
as its strongest asset.

“It's (the department's) policy of
teaching in Russian." the report
said. “is an obvious moral-builder
and should be retained to the
exact point that does not interfere
with the raised intellectual stand-
ards that should be introduced as
rapidly as possible.”

The report praised. in particular.
the teaching of‘ Ivan Elagin and
Arkady Nebolsine.

Gibian and Mathewson expres-
sed the belief the Slavic depart-
rnent's‘problems centered on
leadership. ‘

“A certain authoritarian rigidity
seemed to accompany and enforce
the department’s special ‘ideology’

Qibian-Mathewson recommend-
ed that Poltorazky be relieved as
and that “a rotating
-’.‘tairmanship' in the Slavic depart-

ment" be established with the
"immediate appointment of a
senior scholar from the outside to
relieve the present chairman."
The authors called for the ﬁring
of professor Alexi Kiselev.
“His (.Kiselev’s) student ratings."
the report said. “have improved
from wretched to no better than
mediocre and he is. we were led to
believe. th source of considerable
dissension in the department."

Gibian-Mathewson recommend-
ed the new chairman. if hired.
should be enpowered to fire or
refuse tenure to any teacher in the

department who falls below “stan-.

dard."

“The new chairman should be an
aggressive and ingenious seeker
after funds." the report concluded.
“from, foundations. from private
sources and from the University
itself.”

As a result of the Gibian-Mat-
hewson report. Kiselev was dis-
missed and Poltoratzky was relie-
ved as chairman. ‘T Associate
professor Jane Harris was named
chairman of the Slavic department
in 1975, (Professor Mathewson

was listed as a reference for Harris
when she applied for the position.)

Dornic and Rosenberg differ
completely in their views of the
report's implications. Doric
believes the report is discrimina-
tory and that it advocates ﬁring
teacher of Slavic origin.

Rosenberg believes the report is
not discriminatory and said it was
used to broaden and strengthen the
scope of the department.

Dornic maintains that although
the majority of teachers in the
department are of Slavic origin. the
two key persons in the department.
the chairman and the head of the
Polish program. are not of Slavic
origin. In his opinion. Slavs more
qualified than Harris who sought
the chairmanship.

Dornic and the Slavic legal
defense group have submitted the
discriminatory charges to the
Department of Labor. An
investigation is to take place
sometime this month.

Regardless of the findings of the
investigations. the dispute between
Dornic and the Universtiy promises
to be a long and drawn-out affair.‘

should be preserved and re .'talized. Progress in thisarea can be monitored by wat-
ching the careers of graduates: the kinds of jobs they .geti(so far, the record is not
impressive), their record of publication, participation in professional activities, ex-
change programs with the USSR and other East European countries.

The department’s problems center on leadership, and the solutions will certainly
be found there. The deﬁciencies in this area are first of all intellec ual, as we have
described them, but extend into administration as, well. A certain authoritarian
rigidity seemed to accompany and enforce the department's special “ideology." All
the department’s problems intra-university relations have an administrative dimen-
sion as well. We also heard more talk than we might have expected—we made no ef-
fort to evaluate it—of personal bitterness, charges of favoritism and discrimination,
etc.

We propose, therefore, the following: Recognizing how easy it is to propose and
how difficult it is to dispose, in cases like this, we strongly recommend, nevertheless,
the establishment of a rotating chairmanship in the Slavic Department and the im-
mediate appointment of a senior scholar from outside to relieve the present chair-
man. The new person should be a communicant of the liveliest ideas in literary
scholarship and criticism today, an energetic administrator able to break out of the
department’s present isolation, an active participant in the profession, and in close
touch with the major Slavic Departments of this country and the world (not exclud-
ing Moscow and Leningrad). We think this change is the sine qua non of an upward
turn in the department to healthy membership in the university community.

The new chairman should be empowered to make at least one junior-faculty ap-

K,‘ ., gwa .. ._

.pointment, preferably a vital young person from one of the good departments in this

country. In this process of rearrangement, Kiselev would seem to be involved. His
student ratings have improved from wretched to no better than mediocre and he is,
we were led to believe, the source of considerable dissention in the department. The
new chairman should be empowered to let go, if he or she sees fit, those without
tenure in the department who fall below standard. With backing from the depar-
ment, revise curricula, raise examination standards and stiffen admission policies
for graduate students. (For example, no more “terminal M.A.’s” from other
universities should be admitted into the PhD program.) The chairman should pay
special attention to the problems of language-teaching, including the possible at?‘-
pointment of a language coordinator to oversee all aspects of the special situations
the University and the community present ot the Slavic Department.

FinalIy—-and crucially——the new chairman should be an aggressive and ingenious
seeker after funds—from the government, from foundations, from private sources,
and from the university itself—to support scholarships, faculty leaves; the building
up of the library resources (the increase, infact of the annual Slavic library ap-
propriation, which we gathered is pitifully small) and the other things to guarantee a
healthy academic department that present exercise in cultural nostalgia.

Rotten Apples

It is a sorry fact student government cannot do much at Pitt to
benefit students. But even more unfortunate is the main reason:
students make it unreasonably difficult to help them. I

The apathy and diversity of Pitt's students are a formidable
enough foe for anyone attempting to improve the lot of even a few
students, but recent events at the Student Government-sponsored
food co-op are enough to make us question why anyone attempts to
help at all.

One of the tangible ways a student government can aid its con-
stituents is through a co-op. The number of students participating
allows goods to be purchased at reduced prices, and since there is
no proprietor and much of the work is done by volunteers,
everyone who makes a purchase profits. At some schools
operations have expanded toinclude many items purchased often
by students, and many students have been helped by what is a great
service. But, it appears, not at Pitt.

This year’s Student Government Board has given the food co-op,
started last year, a fair shot. An initial investment was made, a
committee was formed and volunteers were recruited.

Some students have benefitted from the long (and early) hours
put in by some co-op workers. Some have benefited more than
they should have. And that is the problem.

“Lots of food has been stolen,” says Pat Gourley, the co-op’s
coordinator. The theft caused the Co-op to be unable to fill all its
orders last week, necessitating $50 in refunds, Gourley said. That
tells us something is rotten at the co-op, regardless of the condition
of the vegetables.

Fifty dollars’ worth of swiss cheese and broccoli may seem in-
significant, but the fact that students are stealing from their own
co-op is not. If this is how Pitt students greet attempts to help
them, we can’t understand why anyone will try in the future. Even
a gclilod idea usually cannot endure if it is repeatedly kicked in the
teet .

Letters to the Editor

Budget Crisis Teach-In Endorsed

The Union of Graduate Em-
ployees (UGE/PPU-AFT) decided
at a meeting on October 4 to endorse
and participate, in the upcoming
Teach-In on the Budget Crisis
scheduled to be held on October 24.
The teach-in, organized by the
Committee on the Budget and the
Education Crisis, will be an
open-forum discussion on the
present budget crisis at Pitt and
other state-related institutions of
higher education, and will include
members of state, local and campus
unions, as well as representatives
from student and faculty, political
and community organizations.

We, of the UGE, welcome such an
attempt to bring together a cross
section of the state and local
communities to address the prob-
lems posed by the State Legisla-
ture’s delay in approving a vital
grant to state-related institutions of
higher education until September
29, and their failure since that time
to deal with the question of how tax
monies are to be raised to subsidize
the grant. These developments
raise serious questions about the
future of higher education in
Pennsylvania. Retrenchment is
clearly in the air. Even if the schools
receive the appropriations in the
near future, the quality of
education, the job security of
teaching staff and related personnal
and a low-cost education are at
stake—to say nothing of the
negative impact on local and state
economies if retrenchment in
higher education does occur.

Hopefully the forum will serve as a
springboard for some form of direct
action to guarantee the subsidiza-
tion of higher education at levels
which would make retrenchment
unnecessary and to do so without an
adverse effect on essential social
service allocations to residents of
Pennsylvania.

The UGE also welcomes the
forum because it presents us with
the opportunity to clarify some of
the issues involved in the budget
crisis as these relate to graduate
employee unionization here at Pitt.
Too often in the past the university
administration has tried to engen-
der hostility towards the graduate
employee union by hinting that
unionization has been a major factor
behind the rising education costs
which have disturbed and dis-
tressed legislators and won them
over to a position of fiscal
conservatism in the area of higher
education. The logic of this
argument leaves a great deal to be
desired. The University of
Pittsburgh budget has increased in
the absence of graduate employee
unionization and not in its presence.
In addition, raises would account for
but a minor increase in the overall
university budget (less than 1
percent) if graduate employees
were to secure collective bargain-
ing.

Opponents of the UGE have also
charged that itsgmembers are blind
to the relation between unionization
and tuition hikes. But we are not so
much blind to the relation as we are

convinced that a relation need not
exist if public support for higher
education is generous and fo -
ooniing. Moreover, we wan ,
utilize every means at our disposal
to maintain and even extend public
support. At the moment these
means include participation in
forums like that on October 24 and
urging the American Federation of
Teachers’ lobbyists in Harrisburg to
exert pressure upon the recalcitrant
State Legislature throughout the
duration of the budget crisis.

But until collective bargaining for
graduate employees becomes a
reality at Pitt, our strength is
limited. The budget crisis thus
serves as an indicator of the need
and necessity for graduate , -
ployee unionization. Our uniﬁ-
tion will bring with it an organized
and cohesive structure capable of
channelling the energies and
talents of graduate employees and
sympathetic members of. the
university community towards the
attainment of goals outside the
traditional domain . of collective
bargaining. We cannot secure a
contract which will remedy this
budget crisis and those which may
well occur in the future, but we can
exert a strong inﬂuence to prevent

such crisis once we are recognized .

as the legitimate and authoritative
representative of an important
segment of the university popula-

tion.

instructor has the impression that
this student has real potential and
should not be discouraged from
continuing in graduate school. As
things stand now the instructor has
to award a B putting the marginal
student in the same category with
other students who are doing clearly
acceptable work, or the instructor
can give the marginal student a C.

In the latter case, that student will
have to earn a cold A in some other
course during the ﬁrst year or lose
his or her fellowship. On the other

‘hand, a B- is a perfect solution. It

tells the student exactly what the
instructor wants to communicate

by as little_as a B plus in some other
course.

A Position Paper
On The Plus-Minus
Proposal

Francine E. Jefferson
Ph.D. Candidate
Department of Sociology

The current controversy at the
University of Pittsburgh concerning
the adoption of plus-minus grading
for graduate students is like most
controversies in that it is an
amalgam, or even compound, of
several distinguishable issues. So,
let me begin by unpacking the
problematics of the situation.

1. There are those who wish to
return to. or re/introduce, a pass-fail

‘.g'i:§.(:l.i_11'g‘.S3i.iS.t€3,!_Ii,: Advocates of this
I

position do not want letter grades at
all, and hence they are against any
improvement or reﬁnement of a
letter-grade system.

The students here and elszw

themselves have rejected pass-fa if

systems. If a graduate student
transfers to another institution,
there may be trouble in interpreting
the record. This is only one of many
reasons why students have rejected
pass-fail systems. There is no point
now in reviving the arguments for
pass-fail systems——for example,
that grading per se destroys

collegial relations between student

and professor. One can even accept
this thesis without agreeing to its
present relevance.

2. There are those who wish to
improve, or at least change, the
present grading system. Adding
the plus-minus distinction is a form
of “ﬁne tuning.” In engineering
terms, it increases the accuracy and
precision of the feedback loop
running from student to professor
and back.

The basic argument, here, is that

y if we are to have a letter-grade
‘system, then why not use a more

informative one.

3. There are those who really do
not wish to argue for or against any
given evaluation system, but
instead wish to ask why the present
controversy has arisen. There seem
to be two general positions as to why
the issue has come up. I shall dub
these two “Position A” and
“Position B” (do not think of these
letters as grades).

Position A. The University of
Pittsburgh is a bureaucratic mon-
strosity. It also is ‘a racist,
anti-feminist and procapitalist out-
ﬁt. Naturally enough, it would be

ﬁvrried about the evaluation of
‘students, whereas it should be the

professors who are evaluated.
Further, a sloppy system of student
evaluation works to the beneﬁt of
critics; hence, do not “improve”
the present system. The door is
open to all manner of harassing
suits
inaccurate and imprecise.

Position B. The University of
Pittsburgh is a reasonably decent
American university. Competition

among students forhigher degrees

and for later job placement is
becoming more severe. As
competition increases, the demand
V, explicit rules of fair play
The
obvious solution is to make _the
evaluation system more discrimin-
ating. A more accurate and precise
evaluation system is in order.

As a subpoint, let me say what the
interest of disadvantaged minority
groups is in an informative grading
system. Black students in
particular often do not know the
subtle, taken-for-granted aspects of
graduate education. Most of us do
not have fathers, mothers, cousins,
aunts, etc., who have earned
Ph.D.’s. If~one of us receives a
series of A’s (noninformative A’s as
opposed to noninforrnative but
actually failing C's) and then is

 ed out” at the comprehen-
sive level, this is all to often a total

surprise (and is taken as evidence of
discrimination). A more informa-
tive grading system would serve the
long-run interest of members of
truly disadvantaged groups.

In an increasingly competitive
academic marketplace, both stu-
dents and professors need to know

if student evaluation is-

where they stand. Administrators
and professors should be free of
arbitrary harassment (through suits
or quasi-legal maneuvers) that
gains whatever moral force it has by
virtue of the ambiguity or
indeﬁniteness of evaluational pro-
cedures. Students, for their part,
need to know where they stand, too.
A moreadequate evaluation system
serves both immediate and long-run
student interests, especially minor-
ity interests.

Statement Against
The lntroduction of
Plus -Minus Grades

Gale McGloln
FAS Graduate Council

A number of reasons have been
advanced to promote the introduc-
tion of pluses and minuses into the
grading system of graduate stu-
dents in FAS. Iwould like to discuss
each of these in turn, in offering an
opposing view:

1. It has been stated by certain
members of the faculty that since
CAS has introduced pluses and
minuses into the undergraduate

grading policy, this should also be

implemented at the graduate level.
The reason for this is that many
graduate students take upper level
CAS courses and would have both
types of grades on their transcripts.
This statement makes two assump-
tions. First of all, it assumes that it
would somehow be impossible to
grade graduate students in an
undergraduate course without a
plus or a minus. This is unrealistic.
Pluses and minuses were introdu-
ced as options, not requirements.
Secondly, the above statement
subtly implies that there is some

similarity between undergraduate
and graduate grading policy. In
actuality, graduate students in
undergraduate courses are always
evaluated differently from under-
graduates. They are rarely graded
below a C and also usually have
additional course requirements.
There is no reason why their work
could not be evaluated with a
straight letter grade.

2. The opinion has been
expressed that since many faculty
members grade coursework during
the term with pluses and minuses,
its use in ﬁnal evaluation would be a
convenience...and since it is
available now...why not? I react
strongly against the notion that
convenience or availability are
viable reasons for changing a
grading policy. Who would this be a
convenience for? It is certainly not a
convenience for the poor workers
who must calculate QPA’s each
term. As a graduate , student, I
hardly see this as a convenience. If
anything, it undermines the whole
purpose of graduate education. It
increases the level of competition
among students and in doing so
causes the death of intellectual
activity in the university. Creative
ideas become subservient to
discussions of how many pages one
has read or written in the last
twenty-four hours. Therefore it can
only be a convenience for faculty
members adopted at the expense of
graduate students.

3. Others have stated that the
ﬁner distinctions achieved by the
addition of pluses and minuses will
result in finer communication
between the faculty member and
graduate student. This comment
has been spoken to, very ade-
quately, by a student member of

wusu no ENGLISH

Wednesday, October 19, 19‘r1—'n=n.: rm  s

the FAS Graduate Council who
stated that if grades are the sole or
best means of communication
between two professionals, grad-
uate education is in serious trouble.

Graduate students are supposedly
‘past the stage of mass education
and working more intensely on an
individual level with speciﬁc faculty
members, as apprentices to mas-
ters. Is this only a myth?

4. As mentioned above, certain

faculty members view grades as a
form of communication. Many of us
who receive those grades have
realized that it is not the grade that
matters but rather the verbal and
written comments on our work and
the way we ourselves feel about it.
Our progression in graduate school
ispan individual process for each of
us. It culminates eventually in a
piece of unique and creative
work—the dissertation. If ﬁner
distinctions in grading are so
important, why then is the
dissertation not assigned an A- or a
B plus? The dissertation, our most
important effort, is not graded but
will be worked on until a level of
sophistication and competence is
achieved. In that sense coursework
is only a minor part of this process
and yet in considering the addition
of plus and minus grades, it is being
given more emphasis than it rightly
deserves.

I am unclear as to why such a
trivial issue merits the attention of
the full faculty. As a member of the
FAS‘ Graduate Council, I was
involved in many more serious
discussions related to graduate
education at Pitt, eg. orientation,
training, supervision, and evalua-
tion of TA’s and TF’s and. placement
services for FAS graduates. As an
advisory body, we were allowed

only to make recommendations on
these issues. In a day of changing
educational goals and changing job
markets, these are the vital issues to
graduate students. They are
ignored, however, because they are
too complex and too threatening.
An adequate appraisal of the
implications of these issues would
strike at the entire pattern of
interdepartmental and department-
administration relationships.
These are the life and death issues
to graduate students. These are the

Jane Fonda

Still An Activist But The Target’ Charged 

ByBETSY NORMAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
Political activist Jane Fonda,
retnming to Pitt after four years,
ducked big business and corporate
power instead of Richard Nixon and
his Administration as she spoke to
nearly 6m students yesterday.
Fonda is currently on a brief
speaking tour throu hout the
country, not to promote er newest
movie, “Julia,” but rather to raise
money and discourage the
prevalent feeling of apathy among
college students, she explained.
‘I need to raise $30,000 and the
money I'm getting here is going to

help support the building of a
political movement in California
called the Campaign for Emnomic
Democracy. The money is not going
into my coffers. I’ve not sold out or
co-opted just because I'm back on
the cover of Newsweek or making
movies. I’m a political activist and
I’m involved in building organiza-
tion,” she said.

“And the reason I want to do it
from a personal point of view, that
is, come and speak,”Fonda
continued,“is because I’m always
hearing about how you don’t care
about anything, how you’re apath-
etic, how students ‘are real quiet
now. It’s become sort of
fashionable to talk about the quiet
campuses. And smug so-ocalled
authorities talk about how the 1960’ s
are dead.

‘ ‘I don’t know, that may be true. I
personally don’t think it is, but
maybe because I remember my own
student days so well, I know how
crucial this period is in your
lives—you’re in a unique time in
these sheltered walls, but it’s not
going to last long. And what you
think about and how you view today
and the future is going to have a big
impact on your lives.

Fonda urged students to shed
their apathy.

“I think beneath the superﬁcial
veneer of apathy lies a sleeping
giant. If you aren’t angry about
your prospects for the future, I don’t
know why. I think you should be
angry. No matter what good grades
you get, no matter how hard you
work, the chances of your getting a
decent job are slim. You're
graduating into 20 to 30 percent
unemployment. Not only are your
chances of getting any job slim, but
slimmer yet to get any job that’s

going to tap your human potential;
really allow you to become fully
utilized, living human beings. And
I think that’s tgragic.

“It’s tragtic that there is so much
human potential being wasted
because it’s do hard for us to
understand what is going wrong
and what to do about it and what our
role is in it. It seems sometimes that
everything about our culture. about
our educational system--and I don’t
mean that there’s a conspiracy this
way-- but it just seems to be geared
to make us all acquiesce, to feel
helpless, and I think that's where
the apathy comes from.”

Fonda explained from her past
experiences she has seen “people
who one year are apatheic and then

a crisis comes along that touches '

them deeply. The apathy is shed
real quick when there’s organiza-
tion and leadership and
some way out of the confusion. I am
simply a movie actress who feels a
tremendous commitment to com-
municate what I’ve experienced and
learned. I don’t want people to
waste as much of their lives as I
did.”

A drastic change of opinion on the
part of the American people has
helped to create a new political
base, Fonda said.

“Things aren’t all negative
anymore. I think things have
changed very much. And it’s not
just my perception.”

Fonda cited 1967 and 1972 Harris
polls that questioned the American
people on what they felt were the
main threats to national security.
The 1967 poll, according to Fonda,
named student demonstrators,
black militants, atheists, homosex-
uals and prostitutes as the main
threats.“They were the enemys,

Activist actress Jane Fonda attacked big business yesterday when she spoke

at a jammed ballroom in Schenley Hall
tour.

according to 75 percent of our
people, ”Fonda said.

In the 1972 poll,“the threats to
national security were generals who
carried out secret bombing raids,
politicians who used the CIA and
FBI to go after their political
opponents and big businesses that
made illegal campaign contribu-
tions,” Fonda said.

“In other words, consciousness,
not just among radicals, but among
our parents, among the so-called
silent majority, has undergone a
very deep and important change.
So, despite the problems and
confusions of today, there is a
potential new base of people, who,
not so long ago, wanted people like
me run out of the country.”

But Fonda said the central
problem facing this country today is
corporate power and big business.

“Corporate power is truly the.

“A small group of huge corpora-

“Every sector of our economy is

Cafeteria Heists Add U 19

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pilt.Ncws Staff Writer

“So, anyway, I got around seven
bagels and four boxes of corn ﬂakes
and shoved them in my gym bag.
Nobody ever checks you out” --Pitt
sophomore. “One weekend, I took
some containers down and got half a
gallon of milk. I didn’t even bother
taking glasses back to my table, I
just filled the jug at the
machine”--Pitt senior.

Shoplifting? Out and out theft?
Well, yes. Helping yourself to food,
dishes, or ﬂatware from the Towers
cafeteria--whether or not you‘re on
a meal plan and despite the factthat
you didn’t use up your full quota of
meals--counts as stealing. And the
penalty can range from reprimand
to an appearance before he Judicial
Boards.According to,Towers man-
ager, Ted Kokladis, what it
amounts to is “common theft.”

“Students aren’t aware of the
seriousness of this,” Kokladis
said. “They don’t think in terms of
multiplying the amount they
take--even if it’s two cookies--by a
great number.”

Kokladis estimates between 40
and 50 pieces of ﬂatware are lifted
from the cafeteria each week. The
chinaware loss is “minimal,” and

the cost of stolen food ranges
upwardsto $200.

The most serious aspect of
stealing from the cafeteria is
realized by gradual hikes in board
fees.

‘A lot of times when we catch
people, we get the raspberries from
onlookers. They can really be
derisive to us, but it‘s really that

person who is stealing who‘s
hurting them in the long run,”
Kokladis said.

He said that the most people
caught in a week at six.

‘‘It’s difficult to catch them,”
Kokladis admitted. “Many get by
that we don‘t catch.”

Even if a student is caught and

nothing to you, you never voted
them into power. There are so few of
them, they could comfortably fit
into this room. And they really run
the country. They determine, for
example, where you work, what
wages you get and what conditions
you work under, the way schools
spend their money, what you eat,
the price and quality of what you
buy, etc. “So what you can see is
that a conflict is looming up. the
conflict is between the public
interest--the rights and needs of the

‘jority of people-~against the
privilege and the power of a very
few.”

Fonda again stressed the need for
the people to organize, emphasizing
that organization was strong,
individualism weak.

“If ever you feel unhappy and
feel it is hopeless, just think of this
little story told to me by a man in
North Vietnam who was a poet.
When I asked him how he kept
going, he said, If you look at a drop
water falling on a rock, it looks so

i-‘gyegligible. It just splatters in all
 " directions and the rock is still there.
But, he said, ifyou put a lot of drops
of water together. its a torrent, and
the torrent continually falling on
that rock will wear the rock away.
The water isn't destroyed, it simply
ﬂows around the rock and becomes
an even greater torrent. But the
persistence of the water will wear
away the rock, And I think that's
how we have to think of ourselves.

The Pittsburgh Laboratory The-
ater has outdone itself in its newest
production, “The Ruling Class.”

The eight-member company has
captured the ﬂavor of grand old
English aristocracy without the
dryness sometimes associated with
it.

Throughout Peter Bames’s fast-
moving two-act play (previously a
motion picture), the characters are
engaged in conflict. Love, murder,
atheism, communism and sex are
only a few of the topics commented
on in the play.

The Pittsburgh Laboratory The-
ater building is well-suited to this
production. It is an old converted
church, with antique wooden
paneling, a neo-Gothic ceiling. old
fashioned balconies and stained
glass windows. One would expect
to find a British lord in such a
setting.

The small-capacity theater cre-
ates a feeling of intimacy. The
audience is never more than 20 feet
from the drama and is often in the
midst of it, entrances are made
from the wings and from the back
of the theater. This setting,
providing personal Contact with the
actors, gives the play a reality and
intensity that would be difficult to
reproduce in a larger theater.

As the play begins, the mood is
set by -heavy church-organ music.
Completing the eerie, dimly lit
scene is a conspicuously dangling
hangman’s rope.

The 13th Earl of Gurney, played
pompously by Vincent Vok, acci-
dentally hangs himself while
indulging in his eccentric fantasies
on the rope.

The Earl’s family. to its
well-restrained British indignation,
must deal with the heir to his
lordship’s estate, a paraniod
schizophrenic, long haired, ﬂower
child who believes he is God.

The new Earl of Gurney,
brilliantly played by Bingo O’Mal-
ley, has no trouble defending his
delusions of divinity. His logic is
indomitable. When Lady Claire, a

excellently played by Kate Roy-
ston, asks him how he knows he is
God, he replies, “Simple. When I
pray to him I find that I am talking

It is this kind of irony that evens
the match between the lunatic who
believes in love and the establish-
ment that tries to preserve the
honor of the Gurney house.

Finally driven to sanity by his
psychiatrist (Sam Kokotek) and his
family, the 14th Earl of Gurney
becomes bitter and vengeful, and
never quite masters his schizoid
personality.

The Earl’s struggle against the

world and his illness culminates in
a blood curdling Poe-like conclu-
sion that must be seen to be
appreciated.

In addition to its macabre vein,
“The Ruling Class” offers some of
the funniest scenes and lines one
might expect to find in contempo-
rary theater.

(Chris Blaetz), steals the show.

Austrailian Rock Invasion

[I’m] Stranded
The Saints

Magazine
Sherbet
MCA

By JIM FARERI
Pitt News Staff Writer

Australia, known only for kanga-
roos. koala bears and wombats,
now is seeking fame for something
other than quaint animals—its rock
bands. A few years ago Australia
would have had trouble getting
together a decent high school
dance band; today U.S. record
stores don’t know what to do with
all their new arrivals from “down

Two recent exports from the
Island Continent are “Magazine”
by Sherbet and “(I’m) Stranded”

by The Saints. Unlike the majority’

of albums cut in Britain. Canada
and America. these two LP’s still
need work on the drawing board.
Sherbet is a clean-cut. ﬁve-man
piece that usually plays easy rock.
Its sound is consistently whole-
some. light and pleasant; gathering
many diverse inﬂuences into a
smooth blend of rock ’n’ pop.
But don't get too excited. British

is weak and much of their play is
unimaginative.

“Magazine” peaks on only two
numbers: “Midsummer Mad-
ness" and “Summer Love.” Both
feature the tight, end-over-end
rhythm that makes for good pop, as
well as easy melodic lines and fun,
throwaway lyrics. Other tunes that
reach for this quality but only
half-make it are “High Rollin”’
and “I Got Love.”

In spite of the potential revealed
by the above tunes, the rest of
“Magazine" is mucky and mis-
guided. Sherbet deserts its rock ’n’
pop forte for a few scraps of
soul/rhythm and blues. stiff
orchestrations of done-for songs,
an embarrassing George Benson
mime and a BeeGees forgery. It is
unfortunate. because with some
discretion. Sherbet could go places.

The Saints are the rock ’n’ roll
inverse of Sherbet: rudimentary
hard rockers. dirty behind the ears
and out to beat the world. But like
Sherbet. The Saints have come up
with a product that is both
appetizing and distasteful.

Minimal rock can be engrossing
—the Ramones proved it. But one
best be careful if one is going to cut
a whole album on just a few chords.
"(l'm) Stranded" comes off as
downright tedious. Some of the
songs are so similar that one
could not tell where one ends and

the next begins if not for the break
between tracks.

Syracuse University hasn't Won 8

1968. but don’t let that detract from
The_Orangemen’s role aatpotential

made one of the most memorable
defensive stands in Pitt history to
secure the Panthers’ 23-13 decision.

Led by quarterback Bill Hurley,
Syracuse was the only team to
seriously challenge Pitt's bid for an
undefeated season last year, and
Hurley nearly accomplished that
near-irnpossible feat himself by
setting an Orange record of 303 total
offensive yards .

This year, things haven't
changed much. Pitt is still in the

led the offense to 384 total yards,

passes and completed 22-of them
an -school records.

“Hurley is one- of the great
guarterbacks in the country,”
Maloney said via telephone hook-up
at yesterday's weekly football
luncheon. “He has great running
ability, a good arm and ﬁne head on
his shoulders. I like my guy just as
much as I'm sure (Pitt coach) Jackie
Sherrill likes Matt Cava.naugh.”

Though Syracuse has two steady
runners in its backﬁeld in Bob
Avery and Art Monk, Hurley also
leads the Orange rushing attack.
with 367 yards for an offense that is,
at the least, complex.

“Syracuse is extremely tough to
defend against,” Sherrill said,
“mainly because they use about 16
different formations. This could
pose some problems, especially
when you don’t have people on the
practice ﬁeld.”

Some of those people include
middle guards Dave Logan and Jim
Marnich, both of whom deﬁnitely
will miss Saturday's game, giving

expected to start against the
Orangemen.

Not to be outdone by the antics of
Hurley and the Syracuse offense,
Pitt has an explosive offense of its
own--a unit oﬁensive coordinator
Bob Leahy feels is ﬁnally coming
around. ‘

“The offensive team keeps

getting better and better,” Leahy
said. “Asthe running game keeps
improving, it will help our passing
attack that much more.

And leading the Panthers in that
running attack is Elliot Walker,
who, with his 169 yards against Navy
last week, has picked up 610 yards
on the season--good enough for a
6.4-yard average. Walker needs

only to average 78 yards per game to
become the only Pitt rusher besides
Tony Dorsett to amass 1,000 yards in
a season.

Having guys like Fred Jacobs and
Ray “Rooster” Jones to compli-
ment Walker in the Panther
backﬁeld and targets like Gordon
Jones for Cavanaugh _to throw to,
Pitt may just have enough talent to
spoil the Orangemen’s role as
spoiler at Pitt Stadium on Saturday.

West Va. I V's Bop   Cubs, 20-1 2   

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

The West Virginia junior varsity
football team defeated the Pitt
jayvees, 20-12, in a game played
Monday afternoon before a sparse
crowd at Pitt Stadium.

Although Pitt (0-3) was able to
get on the scoreboard first as the
result of a first-quarter touchdown
run by freshman Terry White,
West Virginia scored when it
counted—in a decisive second

half—-—to win its first game in two

tries.

Down 12-6, West Virginia went
ahead for keeps when Tony
Perlozzo scored on a 30-yard
touchdown run with 2:50 remaining

in the third quarter. Rod George’s
kick made it 13-12 and the
Mountaineers. tacking on an
insurance touchdown in the forth
quarter on a five-yard run by James

-Tackett. had taken the lead for

good.

Pitt tallied the first touchdown of
the game on White’s one-yard run
with 56 seconds remaining in the
first quarter and didn’t score again
until the third quarter, when
freshman walk-on Glenn Meyer
pounced on a bad snap with 7.:sn tn
play in the period.

The Mountaineers scored their
other touchdown on quarterback
Mike Williams’s nine-yard touch-
down run with 1:40 left in thefirst

half.

Held to only two yards passing
for the afternoon. West Virginia
picked up its yardage running the
football—garnering 264 yards on
52 carries. with fullback Ernie
Haynes (88 yards on 17 carries) and
halfback Tackett (86 yards, 18
carries) leading the way.

Pitt, on the other hand, picked
up most of its yardage (162 total) in
the air. Freshman Lindsey Delaney
was the" top Panther offensive
leader, completing eight of nine
passes for 150 yards no intercep-
tions.

“Last year? My God,” he said, shaking his’ head
slowly and lowering ‘his eyes to the floor, “you hear
about that happening to other people and you think
you know what it’s like. But you don’t until you
experience it.”

‘‘It’’ was a season so bitterly disappointing and
frustrating that Pitt basketball coach Tim Grgurich
considered resigning for the good of the team. Last
year’s 6-21 season is one that no longer haunts

Grgurich, yet he knows he can't make it disappear.

“l’ve reﬂected a lot on last year,” he said, “and I
realize that I got a little too enthusiastic about the
team before they even had a chance to prove
themselves.

“We started talking about what we hoped to
accomplish before the season even started, and I
think I put too much pressure on the kids.”

With the mention of “the kids,” the exuberant,_
third-vear coach’s gaze jumps from the floor and the
sparkle returns to the eyes. It is said every person
has a passion, and Grgurich’s is his basketball team.
He is quick to point out that last season’s short-
comings were not the fault of “the kids,” but rather
his own. ’

“A1l summer long,” he said, “at camps and clinics
where they were helping out, and even at the
playgrounds, the kids had to eat that ‘6-21 ’ stuff. But
I’ll tell you, even in all the turmoil last year, they
were a darned exciting club that worked their rear
ends off and made a helluva lot of sacriﬁces.

“The problem was that they were ready
physically, but not mentally. We didn’t put enough
emphasis on mental preparation.”

When asked if this shortcoming stock out in any
particular area, Grgurich replied, “Defense is a
mental thing all the way; it’s completely mental.
Every team in college ball will be able to match any
other team in conditioning and usually in size, but
it’s.how well you’re mentally prepared that makes

the difference.”
Pitt played its entire season relying on g

underclassmen, three of whom were freshmen and
had received an unusally large amount of publicity.
Publicity breeds high expectations, and the bitter,
early-season losses suffered by the youthful Panthers
cut deeply into the confidence of the players and also
the enthusiastic zeal of the coach.

“Those losses were tough, awfully tough,”

Grgurich said, “but I felt we were playing some good

 

defense. But some mistakes near the end of the
game cost us some ballgames, and the kids got down
on themselves mentally. And when that happened,
their defensive play broke down more and more.”

Being a scrappy, ball-hawking team due to their
lack of height and overall offensive punch, Pitt was

forced last year to press full court and play defense -

with a rervor equal to that which Daryl Dawkins
brings to the slam dunk. That element will still be
present, Grgurich said, but there will also be some
changes made besides those of a mental nature.

“We gave thekids their head a little too much last
year,” Grgurichsaid, “but we're going to pull back a
little this year. It was a matter of their being
physically able to do some things, but just not
knowing when to do them.”

Although preseason practice is but a few days old,
Grgurich was asked if the team looked ready to forget
last year’s disappointments.

“I see them doing things now that they didn’t do
all last year,” he said. “I know they’re hungry. You

can say whatever vou want about how much we ,

hustled, and how hard we worked on and off the
court, but the ﬁnal question is always, ‘How many
ballgames did you win?’ That’s what we’re all here
for, and that’s what we plan to do. But we’re going
to be a little more cautious about what kind of
predictions we make, because last year I learned
that’s just not the thing to do.”

Granted, the Pitt team did hustle and scrap and“

ﬁght for everything they got last year. But how do
the coaches, who do the recruiting, sell the Panther
program? What answer can be given when a recruit
2s;1s;,"‘Why do I want to come to a school that was
“We think the big thing we have in our favor here
at Pitt is people,” said Grgurich, a ﬁne recruiter who
travels countless thousands of miles each year to
separate the players from the near-players. “Pitt has
the academic people, the alumni and also the people
of the entire city, and they’re all great folks.
“Plus, you can look at our recent record in the pro
draft. We’ve had seven of our players drafted in the

past four years.” -Q

Another big part of a successful recruiting
program is a personal approach, and this is one at
which Grgurich excels.

“You can’t just go up to a kid after his senior year
and say you want him to come to your school. We get
to know the players in their sophomore or junior
years, or even earlier if we can. Here in Pittsburgh
we have an advantage, and we can also offer an
advantage to the city ballplayers because they can
stay close to home and their families come and see
them play.”

It’s hard not to agree with Grgurich. I don’t know
if it’s the coach’s contagious enthusiasm, but I think
it’s his added maturity after a truly nightmarish year.
He’s got his objectives clearly in mind now, and I
don’t think he’ll let his exuberance run away with

3 him.

And when he says he’s just looking to win
ballgames, I. for one,—have got to believe he’ll do just
that. . » .

When Pitt defensive middle
guard Dave Logan left the ﬁeld
shortly before halftime of Satur-
day’s Pitt-Navy game at Pitt
Stadium, he was making a move he
didn’t want to make.

No player likes to leave the
game, especially someone like
Logan who has spent half of his
college football career_waiting for
the chance to start—a goal he’s
ﬁnally attained this year.

But when aisituation arises and
you have to leave. you make the
move. Logan made the move
because of the two sprained ankles

and a half ago. The injuries were
acting up on him again and will be
enough to keep him out of action
next week. also.

“I was conﬁdent our defense
could do the job today or else I
wouldn’t have left before half-
time,” Logan explained Saturday,
“I took a few good shots in the
ankles and I didn't want to risk
further injury to them. so I thought
I would come out.

“Now if the team had gotten into
a situation where they really
needed me in the second half, I

‘would have‘ come back in. But they
didn't, so why risk the chance of
hurting myself and the team?”

he suffered in the season opener
against Notre Dame nearly a month

As it turned out.
absense really didn't

Panthers defensively as Pitt went
on to down Navy 34- l 7 to lock up its
forth win of the season.

But Logan’s injury has hurt in
other ways. Pitt head coach Jackie
Sherrill and his defensive coaching
staff have been forced to make
some adjustments because of
Logan’s absence.

Shifting players from position to
position, the Panthers have ‘been
playing a constant round of musical
chairs in trying to compensate for
the loss of Logan.

A nkles Stall Logan '3 Run at Guard

While the jockeying of positions
hasn’t hurt the Panthers so far. it's
bound to suffer if Logan remains
hurt much longer.

The Panthers right now have to
do without the cat-quick play.

“Sure we miss him.” Sherrill
pointed out. “Dave's loss has hurt
us in that we have had to move so
many people around to compensate
for his not being in there.

Moves. Dave Logan made one

last week when he yanked himself
out of the Pitt defensive lineup. lt’s

Matters of immediate interest to Pittsburgh and of wider social importance will be considered by
a team of faculty from the perspective of anthropology.

Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Mysteries of Civilization
The Last Frontier: Survival from the Sea
Stress: Behavior, Disease, and Ongoing Evolution
Cross-Cultural and Local Perspectives on Illness and Health
Sex Roles: Biological, Evolutionary, and Cultural Determinants
The Failure of the American High School
Salvaging the Judicial System: Moot Courts
Eastern Religions, Western Needs

Cults and Contemporary Religious Movements
Black Ghetto Culture: An Inside Perspective
Can Americans Change their Driving Habits?
Drug Use in Cultural Perspective

Many of the topics will be illustrated with slides or films, and some topics may be presented by
panel discussion or debate. A major objective is to provide a deeper and broader understanding of
social concerns that are profoundly important and intrinsically interesting. Another goal is to
become aquainted with a sampling of the ways by which anthropologists seek an understanding of
important issues through biological, evolutionary, and comparative cultural perspectives. Students
will have an opportunity to discuss each of the topics in small, informal discussion groups.

Readings: No required text, but short readings selected for particular topics and recommen-
ded, but not required, additional readings.

Examinations: One midterm and a final exam.

This course will not provide a general introduction to anthropology as a discipline

also one he hopes he doesn’t have
to make again.

“lt’s just one of those things I
hope doesn’t happen for a while.”
he said. “I want to play.”

Long before the Cathedral of Lear-

ning was even a gleam in a chancellor's

eye. students have relied on more than
intellect and its application to pass tests
and to complete homework. Pitt
students. and quite a large number of
them, cheat for their grades. It is almost
common knowledge. The actual num-

bers who cheat. and what the reasons

are for cheating seem to be the only
thing that isn‘t generally known.

Fifth Avenue Magazine surveyed
850 Pitt undergraduates on their at-
titudes about cheating. We asked them
how they cheated, if they would do it
again, and how they felt about others

cheating. The results of this survey, in-
cluding comments from students sur-
veyed, are on page four.

The survey, more aptly described as
a random sampling of opinion, is not
scientifically accurate. it is however, an
indication of the attitudes about
cheating that are prevalent among un-
dergraduates. ln tabulating the results.
we prefer to let the figures, and the an-
swers, speak for themselves.

While the sampling was restricted to
undergraduates, professional school
students were not ignored. We talked
to faculty and students at the law, dental
and medical schools about the lack of

integrity that may exist even within
those hallowed grounds, despite the
rigid testing procedures and honor
codes (see page six). We also in-
vestigated as well the consequences of
being caught cheating at Pitt (see page
nine). And we have compiled. for your
convenience. a listing of interesting and
often practical methods of cheating you
might be interested in trying {or wat-
ching out for if you are an instructor).

The results of the sampling pose
many problems and many questions
regarding the attitudes of cheaters and
non-cheaters. One of the biggest
questions raised is, do people actually
think it is wrong. and what lets those
who cheat justify their actions.
Cheating does not run rampant at Pitt,
but enough people will admit to it to
suggest that the academicians and the
administration should examine the

values of the institution itself._L_R.’ RN

For Your ‘A’

 But Chances Are
Your Neighbor Got One

By Lisa Rubenstein
and Ron N yswaner

Look around your chemlab, your bio
lab, or psychology recitation section. If
there are 20 people in the class, chan-
ces are that eight of them will be
cheating on your mid-term this week. If
you're not one of those eight who will
cheat, you might be one of seven who
will consider it. lf you don't fall into one
of these categories, pat yourself on the
back—you are part of a minority who
has never considered cheating.

Forty percent of Pitt undergrads
cheat (40.9 to be exact), 34.6 percent
have not yet cheated, but have thought
about it, and 24.5 percent of you
haven't cheated and haven't even con-
sidered it.

By

have never considered it. Out of 850,
there are 348 cheaters, 294 who have
considered it, and 208 who have not
done either.

Among those who have admitted to
cheating, including both the one-time
and the chronic cheater, there are some
interesting trends. Thirty-eight percent
of the cheaters said yes, cheating is
wrong. Thirty-four percent said no,
cheating is not wrong, and twenty-four
percent of the cheaters said it could be
justified, depending on the situation.

From the statistics and from the
comments on the surveys, many who
felt cheating was wrong were able _to
justify their own cheating.- As one per-
son responded, "Yes, cheating is
wrong,” and then, perhaps after a
moment of self-examination, “boy, am l
a hypocrite.”

“Cheating is a way of life.

I even

cheated on this survey.”

CAS sophomore

The figures come from an informal
sampling of 850 Pitt undergraduates
(from a full-time population of about
12,000) in a period from October" 5 to
October 15. Surveys and interviews
were conducted at various places on
campus, in order to include a wide
range of classes, and majors. in
tabulation of the results of the sampling,
a distinction was made between those
who have cheated, those who have
never cheated, but have considered it,
and those who have never cheated and

One senior engineering student put it
this way, “Yes, theoretically, cheating is
wrong, but practically, especially at Pitt,
no." ’

Many of those who said cheating is '

not wrong, simply responded by saying
no, or, "l know I am hurting myself, but l
still do it.” Some offered explanations
that ranged from the cold, impersonal
character of the university, to the simple
fact that cheating is right, because
everyone else does it. One sophomore
chemistry major said, “l think it is wrong,

Wednesday, October 19, 1 977—.5TH AVENUE—Page 5

CHEATIN G

but it is necessary for survival.”

One senior psychology major said,
“No, it isn’t wrong, because ifyou must
take a course and you don’t feel con-
fident to pass, you have to cheat.”

Other students commented that
cheating isn’t really wrong, because the
nature of exams, and the pressure of
grades, rig the system so the only way
to survive is to cheat. “Wrong is a
relative term,” said one. “As soon as
tests are right, cheating will be wrong.”

Especially in the engineering and
nursing programs, and in the College of
Arts and Sciences natural science
majors, students could justify cheating.
When the pressure is too much, and
desperation sets in, for many, there is
no other alternative. Some of the
cheating was only fudging results in a
lab report, but others cited instances of
cheating on major exams and tests.

Another engineer explained why he
cheated, even though he thought it was
wrong by saying: “Engineering is a
bitch, and I don’t have time to jerk
around with trivial courses. That's my
biggest reason. Secondly, if I don’t get
at least a B in these courses, I could
wind up out of engineering due to my
grade point average.”

A chemistry major explained cheating
by saying that the pre-professional
competition is stiff for grades, and
therefore, people are more concerned
about their grades, then they are about
what they actually learn.

If the pressure is bad enough, it can
get to you. Said one junior political
science major, “When, you are under
the pressure, you are no longer making
a rational decision.”

Strangely enough, when some
cheaters were asked how they felt
about other people cheating, many of
them felt it was wrong. ‘ ‘‘lt’s okay for
me," said one, “but not for others.”

Many of those who admitted to
cheating said it was right in some in-
stances for themselves and for other

people. There are those who think that
if the course is out of their major, it

doesn't make any difference. Some
feel that if the professor hasn't made
any effort to make the class worthwhile,
it is O.K. to cheat. In other words, a
student doesn't owe any honesty to a
professor who doesn't show any in-
terest.‘ One student said, “Yes,
cheating is wrong, but in certain classes
that are joke anyway, it isn't wrong."
Some responded that if a student
on‘ly cheats when it is absolutely
necessary, then it is okay. "It's not right

to cheat," said one senior speech-

major, “but my feeling is if I go into a test
thoroughly prepared and I need a few
answers to pull through, I'll look at a
friend’s test." Another speech major
said, ‘‘If you don't study then it is wrong,
but if you are really working your brains
out for some answers then no, it isn’t
wrong.”

For many, there are degrees of
cheating. Copying a lab report, or
copying someone’s homework is O.K.,
but cheating on a major exam, or
stealing a test, is wrong. They might
cheat in a distribution course, but many
would never consider cheating in their
major.

Most of the cheaters admitted to
cheating primarily on tests and
homework, although some said they
cheated only on objective tests, lab
reports, and papers. The classes most
admitted to cheating in, were
psychology, math, chemistry and
biology.
classes. Some cheated in computer
science, primarily by having others write
their programs; others cheated in logic,
sociology, calculus and political scien-
ce.

The survey also asked both cheaters
and non-cheaters to estimate the per-
centage of undergraduates who cheat
at Pitt. It seems appropriate that most

They Say It Doesn’t Happen in Grad School

 

By A ngele Ellis
and Betsy Norman

Hiding law books in a restroom for a
quick look during a test. Passing off a
classmate's dental X-rays as your own
in a lab. Sprinting to the library to look
up answers during your break in the test
penod.

Cheating in Pitt’s law, medical and
dental schools may be inventive, but it is
not widespread. Students and faculty
estimate less than five percent of
professional school students cheat.

Reasons given for the small cheating
percentages include factors peculiar to
the professional schools--honor codes,
monitoring during exams, a career-
oriented atmosphere and a select group
of students. Professional students’
motivations for not cheating are com-
mon to all students--fear, pride, integrity
and honesty.

Cheating is a sensitive issue. None
of the professional students interviewed
admitted to cheating; faculty were reluc-
tant to acknowledge its existence in the
professional schools.

‘‘I'd like to think our students are not
cheating," Dr. Thomas Barker,
associate dean of the School of Dental
Medicine said. “They are in a
professional school and are developing
themselves as professionals.”

Law school Dean John E. Murray
said, “We’ve been fortunate in avoiding
cheating scandals. We have an honor
code and II lS adhered to."

“I've not had word of cheating or
stealing,” Dr. Frances Drew, associate
dean for student affairs of the School of
Medicine said. ‘‘I assume if it were ram-
pant, I would hear about it."

Most professional school students
disdain cheating as a childish and point-
less habit. Students in all three of the
schools agreed the number of cheaters
are few and cheating is of little or no
help to them.

Students in both the medical and
dental schools agreed cheating did not
make a substantial difference in grades.

“l don't think there are any people
who chronically cheat,” a second-year
medical student said. “There aren't any
cheaters who would flunk out if they
didn't cheat. I don't think cheating
makes a substantial difference in
grades. In courses where there is strict
monitoring, those who cheat on other
tests do just as well. Cheating just
won't help you that much," he added.

The grading system of both of the

schools serves as a deterrent, accor-
ding to administration and students in
the schools. The systems are
honors/pass/fail for all classes and
courses.

the registrar.

“There is less pressure when you're
only trying for a passing grade, rather
than an A or a B," one medical student
said. “There aren't any grades except
for pass or fail. You're only striving to
pass. Most students, at least 75 per-
cent of them, just try to pass. There are
those -25'p'ercent who try to be at the
top of the class, but most of us just let
them go."

Dr. Drew of the medical school said
she felt competition decreased when
the pass/fail system was established.

“l’m sure the grading system has cut
down on the competition,” Drew said.
‘‘I believe the students like the system.
It takes the pressure off, instead of put-
ting more pressure on."

But cheating is controlled by tangible
procedures, as well as by abstract
ethics. Big Brother‘ watches, in the form
of codes and restrictions designed to
strike fear, or at least hesitation, in the
potential cheat.

The law school, for instance, has a
strict honor code.

“The honor code works so well
because we're scared we'll get thrown
out if we cheat,” a third—year law
student said.

Under the law school honor code,
each student is assigned a confidential,
three-digit number. The number is
changed each term and is distributed by
This number is used in
place of his name on projects and
exams.

“The system prevents both cheating
and faculty bias," Murray said.

Charges ofviolating the honor code
can be filed against a student with the
law school honor board. When a
student files against another student, he
signs it with his number. The identity of
the accuser, one ex-honor board mem-
ber said, often is not known until the
case comes up before the board.

The majority of the code violations
are technical, according to law studen-
ts. A law student once took his exam
booklet into the hall while he smoked a
cigarette during an exam break,
unaware this practice had been
outlawed. He was brought before the
honor board, but was acquitted when he
proved he had not learned of the new
regulation prohibiting the removal of test
materials from the room.

“Some violations -are really
technical——bringing a candy bar or a
Coke into the law library is an honor
codeoffense," a second-year student
said. The student added the provision is
not enforced.
is being revised, Murray said. “The
revisions are in procedures, not in the
code itself," a former honor board
member said. “There weren't problems
with the violations, but rather with the

procedures of enforcement of the
codef'

There is no honor code at the dental
school, nor is there one at the medical
school

Dr. Thomas Zullo, associate
professor and head of testing at the
dental school, said he was interested in
beginning work on such a code. ‘‘In the
meantime, the dental school adheres to
the University academic integrity
guidelines,”.Zullo said.

The strictness of testing procedures
vary among the three schools.

All law school exams are timed; proc-
tors only serve to start and stop the
tests. Therefore, students are un-
supervised during the exams.

“They treat you as adults," a third-
year law student said.

Some law students—the restroom
cribbers and the library raiders--do
abuse this privilege one student said.
“And that makes you angry."

The nature of law school exams are
an obstacle to anyone considering
cheating. The exams are almost all
essay, with some definitions thrown in.
Essay questions of 1 or 2 pages, single
spaced", are not uncommon.

Law school is supposed to teach the
student to think like lawyers, one
student explained. The facts of a case
are provided and the student must
analyze these facts and argue a
position. These kind of answers aren't
in a book anyway, he added.

A Another student put it this way: “if
anyone can figure out an efficient way
to cheat, they deserve the better
grade.” A

Testing procedures at the dental
school are more strict—aI| academic
exams are held in a flat basement room
and students are seated in random or-
der. A minimum of three proctors
monitor each exam.

A scientific, but hardly foolproof

method to detect dental school cheating?

is a statistical computer program that
correlates the test papers of students
who were sitting near each other in the
exam room.

“The computer program was
developed as a result of anonymous tips
that students were cheating. We look
for papers where there is a high
correlation between the correct and in-
correct answers. If the number of iden-
tical incorrect and correct answers is
high, we'll look into it," Zullo said.

“The program is used on every test.

Q.

Cheating Survey

(Continued from Page 5)

of the cheaters estimate more people
cheated than did the non-cheaters.
They also estimated, in most cases, that
more people cheat than actually do, as
represented by the survey.

Of the cheaters, also half (48 per-
cent), estimated that 75 to 100; percent
of the students at Pitt cheat. Twenty-
two percent estimated that 50 to 75
percent of the students cheat. Seven-
teen percent estimated that 25 to 50
percent cheat. Only 7 percent of the
cheaters thought 0 to 25 percent

».cheat

Non-cheaters, who have admitted to
toying with the possibility of cheating in
the future, most accurately estimated
the number of cheaters at Pitt. Twenty-
nine percent of them hit the number of
cheaters mostaccurately, guessing that
the amount of cheaters at Pitt falls into
the 25 to 50 percent category (the
correct numbei was, remember, 40.9
percent).

cheated, a majority of them have at least
considered doing so in particular
situations. The ‘ smallest group to
emerge from the survey includes those

some may consider to be the most
honest—students who have never
cheated and have never considered it.

As you may have guessed, most of
the non-cheaters feel cheating is wrong.
They view it as immoral, slightly
dishonest, a sin against God, or at least
unnecessary and a waste of an
education. Statistically there is little dif-
ference between the two kinds of non-
cheaters (‘‘yes, I have considered it” vs.
“no, I have never considered cheating”)
on this question. Only a small number
condone cheating, even in desperate
circumstances.

A first year student echoed other
non-cheaters by saying: “Cheating is
wrong. You don’t achieve an under-
standing (of the material).” This attitude
poses cheating as an obstruction to
|earning—cheaters only hurt them-
selves. As another student put it: ‘By

“If you can ’t make it without
cheating, you shouldn’t be here.”

junior education major

The other non-cheaters, to whom it
has never even occurred to cheat, are
most optimistic about the character of
the average Pitt test-taker. Twenty-
eight percent of this group believed that
the number of cheaters was low, falling
in the zero to 25 percent category.

It is almost as if those who haven’t

cheated can’t believe anyone would
stoop so low as to cheat, and those who
have cheated can’t believe anyone
would be stupid enough not to.
A As interesting and various as the
cheaters may be, they are outnum-
bered by those who haven’t cheated.
Students who have never cheated
comprise 59.1 percent of all un-
dergraduates (502 of the 850 we
talked to).

There is a.further division within this

group: Of those who have never

-—write the answers on your desk;

cheating, you’re practically going
nowhere. . .you’re learning nothing.”

Of ‘course not all non-cheaters are so
concerned with the welfare of those
less honest than they. Another major
theme in their comments is the unfair-
ness of cheating. Some people work
for-grades, others cheat. ‘‘In many in-
stances it is not fair for those who con-
sistantly cheat to go flying through
school whereas those who work hard
and honestly sometimes come in
second.”

Cheating as a moral question is one
thing, but what about the cheating that
students are often surrounded by in the
classroom? You know the feeling:

Quietly you sink-to the realization that

you are going to fail your chemistry mid-
term while your neighbor, no less am-
bitious than you, but less honest

The Fine Art of Cheating

« mailbox. I looked at it to gain insight,” the person said.

A senior English major said, ‘‘I prefer to think of this as sharing homework.
Most of the time students are bogged down with numerous assignments and a
cooperative attitude among groups of friends or classmates is essential in an at-
tempt to survive the term. Was the study group in “Paper Chase” actually a
cheating group? Hell, no—it’s called SURVIVAL!” *

Another method of cheating mentioned on the survey is to “get in good with
your T.A. or prof.” One student suggested “sleeping with your instructor.”

Or, if when you take your mid-term this month, you find it harder than you ex-
pected, put a fake name on the paper and tell the prof you were sick and couldn’t

While most of the participants in our survey mentioned the common methods of
.! ating—copying and cheat sheets——there,were some rather inventive methods
.d|SCUSSed. Among the methods you might consider for your upcoming mid-terms

—write formulas on the back of your calculator;
—write theanswers on your body, especially on your legs, your forearms

—steal a test (we’ve been told Math 12 finals are easy to find);
—buy a test (natural science tests are cheap and plentiful);
—sell a test (it may not help you, but you'll make some money);
—take your review sheets into the test with you;

—write the answers on the wall if you sit near it;

perhaps, passes with the help of for-
mulas sparingly sketched on the back of
a calculator.

We asked non-cheaters to charac-
terize their feelings toward fellow
classmates who cheat. After all, their
dishonesty only brings them out ahead
when the grade report is sent home.
Big deal, right?

Several categories had to be created
to include the wide variety of responses
we received to this question. Again,
there was little difference between the

responses of the two groups of non-

cheaters except for one category.

Those who had never considered

cheating were much less willing to
tolerate cheating by fellow students.

One-third of the non-cheaters firmly
opposed classroom cheating, and many
of them feel quite angry toward
cheaters. Said one life science major:
“ I feel it's a threat to me and how my
work is judged. It's also a sign of
laziness and dishonesty.” A senior
economics major offered a . harsh
solution to cheating: ‘‘I think they
should be dismissedfrom school.” One
junior simply stated, ‘‘I don't like those
kind of people (cheaters) very much.”

A second group of the non-cheaters
(35 percent of those who have never
considered cheating and 25 percent of
the others) refused to impose their
values upon others. Cheating is wrong
for them, some said, but others must
answer to their own consciences. _ One
respondent felt that if other people
cheated it "was, “Great—if they don’t
feel guilty." A small percentage of
those polled put conditions upon their
indifference. They agreed. to ignore
cheaters, as long as cheaters ignored
them as well. As one first year student
put it: “That's'their business——except
when it involves me.” People seemed
particularly touchy about having their
shoulders looked over and having their
neighbors peek at their tests. They
don’t mind cheaters, but they don’t want
to help them out either.

Among those who have cheated, and
those who say they haven’t, there is a
common trend. Most people, almost 85

percent, said they would never turn g

someone in. for cheating. And most of

take the test.

The ways to get out of taking a test on the scheduled day are numerous.
there was a death in my family; I’m sick;

Among the most used excuses are:

those who said they would put several
conditions. on their answer, including
their evaluation of the individual in-
volved. Some said. they would try_ to
discuss it with the individual rather than
go to an instructor with the problem.

People may be slightly disturbed
about cheating, and many who cheat
don’t think it is right, but no one is
outraged. Cheating is accepted. It is
almost a social norm. It is no longer a
question of integrity or honesty.

The prevailing attitude seems to be
that cheating is a fact of life at Pitt, and
at most other educational institutions.
As long as your grade is not hurt, or you

do not suffer, it doesn’t matter what.

other people do. Most people, even if
themselves not cheaters, are willing to
live and let cheat.

Several students suggested ways to help friends taking tests. One way was to

We’re using it to try to discourage
cheating," he said.

“There are two flaws in the system
though,” Zullo added. "One is that the
high correspondence of wrong answers
could be mere chance. The other is that
the current average on many dental
school exams is 80 percent, which
means there are fewer wrong answers
to check the correspondence on.”

Zullo recalled one case of suspected
cheating that was dropped, despite
statistical evidence and an anonymous
note naming the cheaters.

“With no one to testify, and because
the statistical evidence was shaky, we
probably couldn’t have proved it in
court," Zullo said.

The medical school's system of proc-
toring exams is similar to that of the
dental school. The departmental exams
given every quarter are proctored by
the department. It is the responsibility
of that department to report any
irregularities, according to Drew.

form of cheating in the medical school
was looking on others papers during the
exam.

“Our tests are primarily multiple

cheating was a habit that is ground out

disease among pre-meds. it is a jungle.
But the disease is gone by the clinical

work in the dental and medical schools

By John Firm

Many people cheat in their courses
at Pitt, at least according to the survey
conducted by Fifth Avenue. There is
speculation that one of the reasons so
many cheat is because few are
“caught" cheating,” and fewer still are
penalized to any great extent for doing
so.

There is no honor code at Pitt, but
there is a guide for academic behavior in
the form of the Academic integrity
Guidelines. The guidelines state
specifically what is expected from both
students and faculty, and what is con-
sidered to be cheating.

If you are one of those students who
doesn’t know for sure whether group ef-
forts on homework problems, or fudging
figures on lab reports are really cheating
check the guidelines. According to the
code, anything is considered cheating if
that type of “group effort” is not
authorized by the instructor.

Under student obligations, there are
sixteen provisions—-thirteen of which
deal directly with cheating.

You’re not permitted to assist others
during a test, and you're not permitted
to receive help. It is against the
guidelines to possess, buy, sell or ob-
tain a copy of test materials before an

not used as frequently as one might
suspect, from the amount of admitted
offenders.

During the past year, 52 cases have
come before the review board on all five
Pitt campuses and only about 21 have
involved cheating, according to
assistant provost, Ray Steele.

Of that 21 , only seven students were
found guilty.

“Most cheating is dealt with at a local
|evel," said Steele. ‘‘In other words, if a
student is caught red-handed, he will
usually accept the alternative offered by
the professor. This often results in a
student taking a failing grade for the
course instead of facing expulsion from
the University.”

When cases do reach the Academic
Integrity Review Board, the decision is
passed on to the respective school
which can accept or reject the deicision
of the review board.

Steele added that no severe
discripline has been recommended to
the school from the review board, and
that there have been no expulsions as a
result of cheating at Pitt during the past
