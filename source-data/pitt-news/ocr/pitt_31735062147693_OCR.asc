Bridge Club Year
Opens Tomorrow

Leader Invites New, Old Members
To Afternoon Meeting‘

The Pitt Bridge Club ‘will begin its
second year of existence tomorrow

when it meets for the ﬁrst time in
Rooms 70-H32, Cathedral, at 1:30
o’clock.

According to Leonard Seder, C37. 01‘-
ganizer and past president of the club,
rubber bridge will be played each
week, with tentative pla.ns calling for
intercollegiate and student-faculty du-
plicate matches at frequent intervals.

Said Seder: “Basing my conclusions;

upon the large number of students and
faculty members who have already
contacted me, I feel certain that the
club will be at least twice as large as
last years For this reason two rooms
have been reserved.”

The ﬁrst meeting, besides inaugurat-
ing the University Bridge season, will
include organizations and election of
officers, and the approval of concrete
plans for the year’s activity. V

Dr. James Taylor, professor in the
department of mathematics, and Dr.
A. 1. Robinson, assistant professor of
chemistry, have agreed to act as spon-
sors. The club -is open to faculty
members as well as students.

Seder stressed the fact that
don’t haveto be good to

The Appointments
SFA has a tough job.

There may soon be vacancies in the
body, but that guess is purely unof-
ﬁcial.

Charles Allcroft, C36, chairman,
does admit that his little circle of
colleagues is very, very, very tired at
about this point, although the week-
end rest may have helped.

The freshmen are responsible, the
little dears.

When an innocent appearing little
notice was inserted in The Pitt News
some time back to the effect that
petitions were available for the chair-
manship of the annual Freshman
Dance, Allcroft complained, immedi-
ately afterward, that not very many
freshmen had applied, and The News
graciously repeated the notice.

And did that start something!

Friday evening, out of Room 801,
Cathedral, staggered Allcroft, Carl F.
Distelhorst, instructor i11 accounting,
Marcella Leyton, C37, James
olas, E36, Harvey Goldstein, C37, and
Robert Churchill, C37. Two days of

First it might be apropos to say
that the biggest gang of would-be

Three Students
File Applications
To Rhodes Group

John K. M. Tibby, editor of The Pitt
News last year, Israel L. Goldberg,
C36, managing editor of The News,
and Robert Fearon, graduate student
in physics, will represent the Univer-
sity at the State 'e1in1inations for
Rhodes scholarships in December.

Each year, according to Dr. Alfred
P. James, professor of history and the
University representative on Rhodes
Scholarships, 32 American university
and college students are awarded
scholarships each year to Oxford Uni-
versity, Oxford, England.

According to the bulletin issued by
the Rhodes Trust, the United States
is divided into eight districts of six
states each for the purpose of making
these 32 appointments. There is a
committee of selection in each state
which nominates from the candidates
applying to it the two best to appear
before the district committee. Each
district committee then selects from
the 12 candidates so nominated not
more than four men who represent
their states as Rhodes scholars at Ox-
ford.

To be eligible, a candidate must be
a male citizen of the United States
for a.t lea st five years, and unmarried:
he must be between the ages of 19 and
25; he must have completed at least
his sophomore year at some recognized
universit.y or college; and he must
have the recommendation of his col-
lege or university president.

Selection is based on literary and
scholastic ability and attainment;
qualities of manhood, courage, un-
selﬁshness, and other personality
traits; exhibition of moral force of
character and of instincts to lead
and to take an interest in his school-
mates; and physical vigor, as shown
by interest in outdoor sports.

Herc’s News! Cap And Gown
Seeks 3 Original Jlfanuscripts

 

By Charles B. Holstein.

I’ve been at this University for
three years and some months, which
isn't so much in the way of bragging
as it is to say “Nothing ever liappeus."

Cap and G-own is looking for a sin-
dent-written show this year. Ho
hummm.

A senior now. almost in good stand-
-ing. I heard that same thing as a.
freshman. I thought about it a bit.
decided to write a show, and let it
go at that. Others before and since
then not only decided to write shows
but wrote them.

There hasn’t been a student-written
Show produced since I call remember.

All of which might lead one to take
Cap and Gowu’s latest announcement
as an annual ceremony —- somewhat
like that in England, where a be-
costumed gentleman searches the cat.-
acombs of Westminster for possible
assassins before the King's ministers
enter the building for the opening of
Parliament. In other words, it's a
pretty sort of thing, held over from
previous generations, but it doesn't
seem to mean anything.

However, from the office of the as-
sistant deau of men, 'l‘heod0re W.

_unteered to assist any students who

it’s really not as bad as it all appears.

It’s true that no student-written
show has been produced in recent
years. But there-have been books
written in legion. Some were good.
Some weren’t. But. still, some were.

A special committee of Graduate
Cap and Gown Club members has vol-

have ideas for a show—to assist them
and help them and advise them and
worry with them. That's something
new.

In the pa.st, those books which were
submitted by students were turned in
at the absolute zero hour. too late to
be properly revised, rewritten, or
whatever. This year, says Mr. Biddle,
all students who are interested are to
contact him immediately, even though
they have made no start in their
writing. A number of conferences will
then be arranged. he says. during
which ideas can be mulled over and
expanded.

After almost. four years, maybe
something is going to happen. The
quest for the great uut.ried———a student-
written show——goes on. The word is
now. “Talk to Ted!”

(When answering advertisements,

Biddle, comes the annual plea, and

please mention The Pitt News).

Ferguson Speaks

Before Seminar

Social Science Assembly Hears
Discussion Of Administration

Dr. Russell J. Ferguson, associate
professor of history at the University,
was the guest speaker of the Social
Science Seminar when it met Friday
for the second time this year.

Dr. Ferguson, speaking on “The Na-
ture and-Background of the Roose-

velt Administration,” addressed a
group of representatives of the de-
partments of philosophy, political
science, sociology, economics and his-
tory.

In referring to the topic he stated
that “The time is not yet ripe to
evaluate his (Roosevelt’s) permanent
program. It will be a quarter of a
century before that can be done with
any degree of accuracy.” In summing
up the points of his address, Dr. Fer...
guson suggested that “President
Roosevelt, elected in a protest elec-
tion, patterned after Jackson in his
steps to solidify the New Deal party,
paid lip service to Jefferson but bor-
rowed the ideas of the minor parties
of the 1890's for his program and
plunged boldly into the task of in-
tegrating the clashing elements of
our society. His greatest contribution
or offense, whichever it may be, is
that he has attempted to hasten the
readjustment of social and economic
institutions by governmental di-
rection.”

Following the address there was
general discussion of the topic.

The Seminar was held before an
estimated attendance of 50 faculty
members. »

500 Sign Peace
Assembly Petition

 

 

Faculty, Students Seek University
Peace Meeting November 8

The chairman of the Student Alli-
ance, new discussion group on cam-
pus, announced at a meeting Friday
that approximately 500 students and
faculty members had signed petitions
for University participation in the
nation-wide student peace movement
scheduled for Friday.

These petitions, in circulation since
last Thursday, ask directly "for a por-
tion of the time, allotted for the pep
assembly on November 8” to be de-
voted to this University’s part in the
country’s demonstration for peace.

The national movement is under
the sponsorship of the student coun-
cils of the YM-WCA and the National
Student Federation of America.

The petition asks for 10 or 15 min-
utes of the pep assembly for some
type of anti-war program.

At a meeting of the group scheduled
for Vvednesday at 12:30 o’clock in the
Y Hut, the success of the petitions
will be reported. _

Bruno Pozzi, C37, newly-elected
chairman, announced that interested
students and faculty members are in-
vited to attend.

Dartmouth To Debate
Here On December 12

A campus debate with Dartmouth
College, set for the afternoon of De-
cember 12, will mark the opening of
the season for the Men’s Debating As-
sociation. The subject of the contest
will be the Pi Kappa Delta question:
Resolved, that Congress shall have the
power by two-thirds vote to over-ride
decisions of the Supreme Court mak-
ing legislation unconstitutional.

Members of the debating squad have
been holding regularvweekly discus-
sions on Mondays, to prepare for com-
ing debates.

IFu'ture contests are not yet decided
upon. There will be several high-
school debates on the question of so-
cialized medicine, and one in April
when debaters of the University of
Florida visit the campus.

Radio Columnist
Gives Soph Hop
Band Big Boost

“I give my unqualiﬁed recommenda-
tion to'the band you have picked for
your Sophomore Hop this year.”

Si Steinhauser, radio editor of a.
downtown paper, was speaking.

“Archie Bleyer’s orchestra is a
ﬁnely molded dance unit, and his
syncopated melodies will make danc-
ingathorough pleasure. The very fact
that he hadsuch long engagements at
the Hollywood Restaurant a.nd the
Commodore Hotel in New York City
proves his excellence.”

Bleyer’s band will be here on No-
vember 8 for the Hop, and the leader
will appear in person. According to
Theodore VV. Biddle, assistant dean of
men, and D. C. Schultz, BA, chair-
man of the affair, no such condition
will arise this year as last year, when
Ferde Grofe’s band arrived, but with-
out its leader.‘ Iron-clad contracts
have been signed and delivered to
the dean of men’s offices to insure
Bleyer’-s coming.

In a letter to Schultz, Bleyer of-
fered to play any request number
asked of him the night of the dance.

'l‘o sum up the details: '.l‘ickets are
$2.50, the lowest Soph Hop price in
history; the location is the Twen-

tieth Century Club; tickets may be

obtained from committee members,
Miss Mary Milburn in Room -8.01, Ca-
thedral, and William Daufenbach.

Business Bureau
Will Issue-Study

Bituminous Goal Industry Shifts
Reprted By Fritz, Veenstra

According to an announcement in
the “Pittsburgh Business Review,” the
Bureau of Business Research will pub-
lish the resultsof a special study
made on the “Regional Shifts in the
Bituminous Coal Industry With Spe-
cial Reference to Pennsylvania.”

This study is the result of extensive
rese.a.rch on the part of its co-authors,
lvilbert C. Fritz, instructor in ﬁnan-
cial research, and Theodore A. Veen-
stra, instructor in statistical research.
It is expected to be ready for publica-
tion November 15.

Divided into two pa.rts, the study
deals ﬁrst with the marketing izhan
nels for bituminous coal and with the
changes which have occurred in the
distribution of bituminous coal in the
period from 1915 to 1934. The second
part is a ‘more general discussion of
the problems of instability in the
bituminous coal industry. Under this
general topic the economic effects of]
regional shifting are described. and
the various measures proposed to
solve the problems of the industry are
analyzed. I11 this connection the pro-
visions of the Guffey-Snyder Coal Act
are critically examined, and the ex-
tent to which they promise solution
of the basic difﬁculties of the industry
is discussed. Finally, the essentials of
a. national policy toward the industry
are outlined.

The study will appear in 13 chap
ters of about 175 pages. Extensive
data on the production and distribu-
tion of coal are shown in 59 tables
and 24 maps and charts. The Bureau
announces that due to the cost. of
printing and mailing there will be a
charge of $2.00 a copy.

Of Chest Drive

The Pitt Campus Chest, formerly
known as the Pitt Student Chest, has
announced its campaign for the pres-
ent year. Faculty and students will
contribute to the same cause, instead
of to different groups as in the past.

Freshman orientation classes for
both men and women will be address-
ed.in their respective scheduled hours,
as will classes in English 2, 21, and
22; and classes in Education 7, 8, 61
(Psychology 61). and 161. The Engi-
needing Seminar will also be address-
ed in a group. Juniors and seniors
will be interviewed personally.

The Campus Chest drive is headed
by Emerson Shideler, C37, and is un-
der the supervision of William VV.
Mendenhall, executive secretary of
the YMCA. Student leaders include
Margaret Lehm, Ed36, Florian Maj-
chrzak, CE37, and Ann Heyward, C34.
Miss Heyward will head the junior
and senior drive. - ,

Faculty members on thecampaign
besides Mr, Mendenhall are Miss‘ Hel-
en Bool Rush, assistant dean of wo-
men, and Theodore W. Biddle, assist-
ant dean of men.

Organizations in the University
beneﬁting from the Chest will be
YMCA, YVVCA, and the Student Loan
Association. Pitt—in-China may or may
not be included, Mr. Mendenhall said.

National Defense
Is Inquiry‘ Topic

“All life is a continuous battle
against pressure,” stated Captain
Edward A. Kleinman, assistant pro-
fessor of military science and tac-
tic, in an interview with The Pitt
News.

Captain Kleinman will address
Inquiry Forum, on Vvednesday, at
12:30 o’clock, in Room 107, Alumni
Hall, on “The Dangers of Unprepar-
edness.”

He further maintained that “wars
are fought, usually, because some
nation wants something that it feels
it should have, immaterial of
whether it is morally proper or not.

“People do not ﬁght because they
have arms, they have arms because
they want to ﬁght,” the Captain con-
tended. .

Captain Kleinman will indicate
how disarmament has not proved to
be the boon to international.peace
that its proponents believed it
would be.

Dr. Silverman To Address

Delegate From Norway
To Talk Of Future,
His Own Work

The League of Nations will occupy
student minds at the fourth hour to-
morrow morning during 9. general as-
sembly in Memorial Hall, at which
Carl Joachim Hambro is the speaker.

Mr. Hambro is probably one of_ the
best informed persons in this country
today on me machinery of the League
and its potential effectiveness in set-
tling present and future world prob-
lems.

Europe, according to reports, is to-
day in a state of violent unrest. Fear
of impending military catastrophe is
creu._.e_d with being the predominant
force in contemporary minds.

Mr. H3..nib1'o, Norway’s principal
delegateto the League, member of
the organization’s executive commit-
tee, a.nd- responsible largely for many
of the accepted methods of League
procedure, will address an expected
gathering of more than one thousand
students and faculty members on his
personal. experience in League ;work
and his theories of League futures.

In this country for a short visit un-
-der the auspices of the American-'
Scandinavian Foundation; he is--com-
ing.to the University at the invitation
of Dr. John G. Bowman, Chancellor,
who will preside at tomorrow’s_ meet-
ing. Mr. Hambro will appear‘at-a
very limited number of eastern United
States colleges and universities. .

Vvednesday he is scheduled to, con-
clude his Pittsburgh stay after a talk
before the Social Science Seminar.

The ‘speaker ranks in his own coun-
try as -second, only to the King. Pres-
ident of the Norwegian Parliament
since 1926, and a member of the gov-
erning body there siuce 1919, he has
had a varied career as parliamentarian
and editor. For a number of years
he directed the editorial policy of the
Morgenbladet, 0slo’s leading news-
paper.

Before and after the address tomor-
row, 50 pieces from the University or-
chestra, under Lee M. Lockhart. di-
rector of‘U_n"iversity musical organi-
zations. willplay. “Alma Mater” will
conclude the program.

In bringing Mr. Hambro to the cam-
pus it is felt that, since there is no
United States representation in the
Leagiie, he is perhaps the most au-
thoritative person now in the count,-ry_
on this body. .

The importance of the League itself
in this country today is well attested
by the furore in the American press
over the Ita‘lo—Ethio'pi'a'n situatiomand
the -League’s adoption of sanctions
against Italy in lialfing hostilities.

Last year Chancellor Bowman was
responsible for a campus view into
the outside world by bringing Villa-
jalmur Stefansson, famous Arctic ex-
plorer, here for a series of lectures on
the new frontiers of the far north.

Recent Quakes Leave Mariel 
On University’s Seismograph

Delicate needles of the three Uni-
versity seismographs recorded the
earthquake that shook the Pittsburgh
district early Friday morning. The
shock lasted, according- to the graphs,
about 12 minutes, starting shorty
after 1 o’clock.

Due to the absence of Homer H.
Rutherford, instructor in seismology,
there has been no. official interpreta-
tion placed on the shocks recorded
on the local inst1'ument.. However,
University estimates that the quake
had occurred about 400 miles from
Pittsburgh, were substantiated by
later reports that the center of dis-
turbance was on the Maine coast.

The graphs showing the progress
of the quake will be sent to \Vasl1ing-
ton for complete analysis to aid in de-
termining the exact center of the dis-
turbance. In Pittsburgh the shock
was so severe that several residents
were thrown from their beds.

According to Henry Leighton, head
of the department of geology. the

quakes were not severe enough to

show on‘ the surface in the district.
The only records of the tremor.wi.‘r.l
be those indicated by the instrumcn‘.s.

Since the establishment of the Uni-
versity seismology experimental sta-

-tion in November-. 1929, the seismic-

graphs have recorded most of the im-
portant tremors in the United States
during the past six years. The Mon-
tana quake of last Thursday, which
lasted for about four minutes, was in-
dicated on the seismograph drum.

The station is one of those estab-
lished by the United States ‘Geologic
Survey throughout the country in
order to record the intensity of cart} -
quakes in various districts and dis-
cover the center of tremors.

Mr. Rutherford is at the present
time engaged in completing research
on the bed-rock of the Appalachians
off the coast. of Norfolk, Virginia.

About 1:30 o’clock Friday after-
noon, another shock was recorded.
Because of the weakness of the

tremor, no deﬁnite information ‘could
be discovered from the records except
that it was not local.

Peace And Pep

COUPLE OF RATHER strange bed-fellows
A a.ppear to be battling it out for the third

hour Friday. Last Friday ’s issue of The Pitt
News carried an advance notice concerning a huge
pep assembly to be held at that time in prepara-
tion for the Army game. In today’s paper there
is a notice to the effect that approximately 500
students and faculty members have signed peti-
tions asking that a part of the pep meeting period
to be used for a demonstration against war.

The whole business, it appears, was rather bad-
ly bungled in the last meeting of the Student Fac-
ulty Association. A motion to the effect that the
University student governing body should plan a

peace meeting in conjunction with such demon-A

strations throughout the country was somewhat
hastily sidetracked by a motion for a pep meet-
ing. It is also reported that the sponsor of the
original motion for the peace affair did not_ vote
against the motion for a pep meeting at the same
hour.

Now we have a pep meeting planned, with elab-
orate preparations, and_ a certa.in group is still
ﬁghting for a peace meeting. The idea of staging

a pep meeting and a peace meeting in sequence‘

must seem at once impossible and ridiculous. The
two do not go together. They may be likened
unto pickles and ice cream, cabbage and honey,
brown gravy on spinach.

It does not seem possible to wave arms in unison

at one moment and wave olive ‘branches'th‘e next.“

More closely to the point, perhaps, is t.he observa-
tion of a student that such a combination would
be similar to an orchestra conductor inciting oiie-
half of his orchestra to a crescendo with one hand
and ﬂattening his hand upon the other half to tone
it down.

That the circulators of the petition themselves
want to share a meeting with some joepsters seems
doubtful. After all, the pep meeting has a deﬁnite
purpose to ﬁll. The student cheering sections must
put on a new throat, so to speak, if any headway
at all is to be made against the volume to come
from a compact horde of leather-lunged cadets on
Saturday. _

That the peace meeting advocates are angling
for another hour in which to meet seems likely to
be the case. It is here that we may come right
down to the question, “VVliy a peace nieeti1ig?_”
One of the ﬁrst answers to be thrust forward is
that the meeting would be in collaboration with
those of many “colleges and universities through-
out the country-” That point is shaken somewhat
by the fact that these very students who proclaim
themselves so opposed to a faction or factions lead-
ing them straight to war are allowing other fac-
tions to encourage them to stir up agitation for a
peace-meeting. The comparison may seem at ﬁrst
ridiculous, but there is no denying its parallelism.

Granted that there a.re enough students at the
University who are of their own volition, and not
because of what other schools may be doing, inter-
ested in holding a demonstration for peace, what
inay,be the assurances that nothing w'ill_ result
from such a meeting which would make the Uni-
versity and the University students appear silly?

Last _vear the presence of a. chairman who kept
his head and his courage in the face of almost
taunting opposition by his own classmates was all
that kept an uninvited speaker, not a student, from
taking the ﬂoor. That chairman was roundly crit-
icized for his ‘actions by many, but to View the
thing in” perspective as all of us can do now it must
be admitted that he took the right course. To
have uninvited speakers from outside speak at a
University-sponsored meeting could easily produce
some very embarrassing results, both to the school
and to its students. All this must be considered.

It is hard to believe that pep and peace ‘will
share the third hour Friday. And by the way,
isn’t.it a peculiar trick of coincidence that this
pep meeting has something to do with an outﬁt
called the Army?

A Great Opportunity

University students and faculty have an excep-
tional opportunity tomorrow in hearing Mr. Carl
Joachim Hainbro discuss matters pertaining-to the
League of Nations.

The Norwegian legislator comes here as a guest
of Chancellor Bowman in something of a return
favor for kindnesses which the visitor’s son ten-
dered Dr. Bowman when the Chancellor was in
Norway.

Hardly a more opportune time for Mr. Hambro’s
visit can be imagined. VVith the eyes of the world
upon it, the League of Nations faces its most im-
portant problem. .

The chance to hear something of the situation
from the “inside” should crowd Memorial Hall
tomorrow. '

An Order Of The Court

It's a horrid word on this campus and it never appears
in our publications—especia1ly in advertisements—but at
Penn State it’s the staff of something or other. The
Student Tribunal up thar, in censuring fl freshman who
had violated customs requirements, sentenced him to
supply the Tribunal with seven bottles of beer. The Col-
legian, student paper, cried havoc, editorially, accusing
the Tribunal of petty grafting.

Don’t Get Canary

The Yales and Harvards still keep up their playful
rivalry. A canary bird, Yale Daily News mascot, was
kidnapped by three Harvard men the other day.

Popurlar Courses

A professor of psychology at Colgate required his stu-
dents to sleep in the class room so that he could deter-
mine the most effective pitch for an alarm clock.

The First Push

The University of Delaware traces its descent from a
private school opened by a Presbyterian clergyman in
1743.

Bum Razor Helps, Too

A beard growing contest was held recently at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota in connection with the homecoming
celebration. The winners declared that prayer and
spinach are the requisites for nursing beards.

What Will The Next Be?

Two Harvard professors made a study of 902 major
wars which have been fought since 500 B. C. They coni-
piled a statistical index according to the number of com-
bats, the duration, casualties and the number of nations
involved. This startling fact was brought to light—tlie
World War was bigger than all the other 901 combined!

Ancient History

Male students at Boston College have asked‘ that coeds
who are lonesome don red dresses to distinguish them
from the common herd.

So There Was A Reason!

The depression has had at least one beneﬁcial effect in
the belief of President Louis D. Coffman of the Univer-
sity of Minnesota. He attributes the attainment of a 10-
year high in scholarship last year to the fact that stu-
dents had less money, more time for study. .

What! No Pink Elephants? .

Gatekeepers at Ohio State University have a novel
method for deciding whether you’re sober enough to
enter the Stadium. If you can wiggle your thumbs in
unison, you’re 0. k. Otherwise you can watch the game
from a telegraph pole.

And Still The-y Come
According to a survey by the Columbia Alumni News.
159 of the ﬁrst year men on the campus. this year have
fathers, mothers, sisters or brothers who have been or
are students of that university.

Letter To The Editor I

Editor, The Pitt News:

Time and time again I have picked up a copy of The
Pitt News this semester and found therein an empti-
ness and void so penetrating that I am obliged to ask
myself, again and again, Is this a college publication?
Am I a college student? What in the world, sirs, has
happened to our Pitt News? Surely, in a student body
of some ten or eleven thousand. there can be found
minds keen enough, minds developed enough to con-
tribute solid, accurate, constructive thought to the col-
lege paper. , ,

I thoroughly disa.gree with those who contend that ‘

college students are “dead from the neck up.” However,
one can readily see how such a fallacy becomes wide-
spread when one reads such social-illiterate papers as
the recent issues of the Pitt News. If you have not
realized it before, perhaps it might be well to inform
you that the college student is a social being, that is,
he is one whose life is intimately connected with, a.nd
socially bound to the life of the great social group known
as SOCIETY. As such, then, one would expect of him a
little social thought, or at least an attitude of concern

or interest in the many group problems which face our‘

world today. If social thought exists in our university

—and I believe it does—certainly your paper has utter- .

ly failed to reﬂect it in the smallest measure.

After all, the careful and pretty balancing of the front
page of a paper with nicely arranged pictures is no re-
ﬁection at all of the contents of that paper. You rea-
Iize, of course, that a news organ might be symmetric-
ally arranged as to pictures and articles and yet have

little or no content——be almost a meaningless collection "

of nonsense syllables.

Another idea of which it might be well to explode-

is the general superstition that all individuals who

THINK—that is, who think clearly, objectively, critical-'

1y, constructively are revolutionists.

Such is far, far
from the case.

Rather, I should say, the outright revo-

lutionist is the one who is blinded and befogged by his-
own hysterical ragings against what he sees from one‘

and only one viewpoint.

I assure you, you will not be a dangerous RED if you
turn your mind toward group problems, and I urge you,

therefore, to think—-—think SOCIALLY, and reﬂect at.

least a. little of that thought in our paper, The Pitt News.
ALBERT G. DIETRICH.

 

By Richard Cooper

If you should ﬁnd a curly-haired,
dark-skinned fellow sitting next to
you in class writing in an undeciph-
erable scribble from right to left,
don’t be alarmed—it’s Edward Ghor-
ra taking his lecture notes in Arabic.

Ed is a native of Syria, is a gradu-
ate of the American University in
Bierut, Syria, and is now doing under-
graduate work here in political sci-
ence to familiarize himself with Amer-
ican customs and institutions. With
a year of law to his credit taken at
the University of Lyons, France, he
hopes to enter the School of Law
next year,

Leaving his home in Syria over two
years ago, Ghorra made a tour through
Italy at the expense of the Fascist
government. lH.aving heard Mussolini
speak on two occasions while he was
there, Ed says that he is one of the
greatest orators of the century. After
a month in Italy, Ghorra entered the
School of Law in the University of"
Lyons.

Freshman Dance

(Continued From Page One)
Miss America to the dance and then
put forward a “swell attraction.” Also,
any I-Iollywood beauty queens in Pitts-
burgh at the time, he thought, could
be drawn to the affair.

One classy suggestion was for a
bridge tournament at intermission,
and bridge tables set 11p all evening
for those who didn't care to dance.

Amateur night contests, date bu-
reaus, name bands for $100, were all
proposed. And the committee was
overwhelmed by one young lady who
conﬁdently felt she could dispose of
150 tickets for the dance single-
handed.

Well, now, there’s probably no eth-
ical reason for holding the boys and
girls up to a bit of ridicule, but, ac-
cording to Allcroft, some of the
“snazzy suggestions” were entertain-
ing enough to keep the over-worked
committee from collapse and wide-
spread exhaustion.

If one of the newer reporters were
to hand in a story like this and ex-
pect it to be printed he’d be liatcheted
with dispatch. Without doubt, this
is the most ﬂagrant example extant
of burying the important facts of a
story to a sorry point. However, here
are the six who face the Executive
Committee on Wednesday:

Jay Reich, BA, Pi Lambda Phi;
Bernard Cashdollar, BA, Phi Delta

ma Chi; Bernard McKenna, C, and

Since coming to the United States
a year ago, Ed has traveled through
the Middle Atlantic States and is now
living with relatives in Pittsburgh, He
likes the University and thinks that
the Cathedral of Learning is the most
beautiful ‘building in America, “The
other sky-scrapers have lots of
ﬂoors,” he said, but they’re too plain.”
For this reason he was not particu-
larly impressed with the New York
sky-line.

As a result of his extensive travels,
Ghorra can speak Arabic, English,
French, and Italian. He wants to con-
tinue his study in languages, “This
is a cosmopolitan century——the more
languages you know the better,” was
his comment.

What does he think of American

girls? In America, he says, there is
much more variety in the types of
beauty of the girls, than in other

countries.

And The Pitt News? “Splendid!” he
replied. “It’s far superior to the
school newspaper of the University of
Lyons.”

Social Workers
To Hear Lecture

Sociology Division Will Sponsor
Series Of Open Institutes

Throiigli a special grant of the Buhl
Foundation, the department of social
work of the University, is enabled to
present a series of lectures and insti-
tutes to the community.

The ﬁrst of the series will feature
Miss Bertha C. Reynolds, associate
director of Smith College of Social
Vvork, and research associate of the
National Committee for Social lHy-
giene, who will address a meeting of
supervisors of social work in Alle-
gheny County. Miss Reynolds will
speak on “Supervision in Social Agen-
cies,” Thursday, Friday and next Tues-
day.

Miss Reynolds is one of the out-
standing authorities in her ﬁeld, and
the author of “Between Client and
Community,” and “Experiments in
Short Time Contacts in Interviewing.”

At the second lecture of the series,
Kimball Young, head of the depart-
ment of sociology of the University of
Wisconsin, will address an open meet-
ing on “Propaganda in the World.”

Electrical Worker Amazes

Crowd With Scientiﬁc Feats

Although performing what seemed
to be miracles in the “House of Magic”
demonstration held in Memorial Hall
Thursday, Herbert Du Val, Jr., of the
General Electric laboratories, convinc-
ed his audience that the entire per-
formance was -based entirely upon sci-
entiﬁc facts. Those not acquainted
with the scientiﬁc principles found
this rather difficult to believe, especial-
ly in such cases as the lighting of a
light bulb that Mr. Du Val was holding
in front of a coil of wire while using
his arms to pick up the waves given
off by the coil. Although the bulb was
lighted, he assured the audience that
he received no shock from the waves.

Making the light waves that passed
through the teeth of two combs sound
like the bark of a dog was Mr. Du Val’s
way of showing the cperation of the
sound track on modern motion picture

Foster Memorial
Progress Noted

Stone work on the Stephen Col-
lins Foster Memorial building on
the Forbes Street side of the Ca-
thedral, is progressing to the point
where the entire ﬁrst level is en-
closed.

The steel work has been up for
quite some time, and now workers
are ﬁlling in concrete and adjust-
ing the Indiana limestone blocks.
The building will complement the
modiﬁed Gothic plan of the Cathe-
dral.

When completed the Foster Me-
morial will be the headquarters of
all University musical and dra-
matic organizations, and its audi-
torium will be given over to fre-
quent concerts and productions.
Pitt Players, the band, orchestra,
and glee clubs will be chiefly bene-
ﬁted by it, and through presenta-
tions by these groups the general
student body is expected to develop
culturally far above possibilities to-
day.

ﬁlm. Changing the size of the teeth
intercepting the waves, changed the
pitch of the bark. The same appara-
tus picked up vibrations emitted from
a phonograph which were changed in-
to light waves, then converted back in-
to sound.

Taking the light from a mercury va-
por tube which was held in the ﬁeld of
the high frequency coil by simply pass-
ing his hand over the tube and making
it seem as if there were _ten ﬁngers on

possible by the eccentric behavior of
the apparatus.

Mr. Du Val completed his show by
demonstrating the chemical reaction
taking place to make the ﬂickering
light of the ﬁreﬂy. Although this and
several other features were less im-
pressive because of the inability to
darken Memorial Hall, the entire show
lost little of its interest.

Panthers, Rams
Get Scoreless Tie
In Listless Game

Both Elevens Reach Opponents’
20-Yard Line But One Time;
Palau’s Kicks Go Wide

Muddy Field_l\_’Iars Play

Through four full quarters the
Panther panted and the Ram rammed
up and down the Polo Grounds grid-
iron Saturday, and it was all to no
avail. The scoreboard read the same
at the end of the tussle as it had at
the beginning: Pitt 0; Fordham 0.

The scoreless tie marked the ﬁrst
time since 1928 that Pitt has failed
to subdue an Eastern foe. It was also
the ﬁrst time the Panthers have been
held scoreless since the Rose Bowl
game on New Year’s Day in 1933,
when Southern California turned the
trick.

Scoring opportunities for the teams
battling in the ball park home of the
Giants were as scare as tickets for
the Army game here Saturday. Pitt
managed to force its way down to the
Fordham 2'0~yard line on one occasion
and Fordham sneaked a little closer
to p_ayoff territory by reaching the 18.
With the exception of those two
sorties, the 20-yard plots of grass be-
fore each goal-line suﬁered no wear
and tear whatsoever.

Andy Palau, Fordham quaterback,
essayed placement goal kicks of 28
and 32 yards respectively, in the sec-
ond and fourth quarters, but both went
wide of the mark.

In the matter of ﬁrst downs the
Panthers had the edge, six to ﬁve. The
Rams gathered the most yards, 84 to
75. Fordham’s superior kicking was
a big factor in keeping the visitors

the game.

The ﬁrst ﬂurry of the afternoon
came just after the kickoff when Mc-
Knight intercepted one of Randour’s
passes in midﬁeld. No sooner had
the Ram rooters begun to whoop it up
than did Biff Glassford return the com-
pliment to Fordham. Near the end of
the quarter, a 24-yard pass from Woit-
koski to McKnight prompted Coach
Jimmy Crowley to send his ﬁrst team
racing into the game to carry on.
They didn't. ‘-

Greene's Punt ‘s Short

Arnold Greene’s punt out of another
tough situation was short and after
the Panthers held for three downs
Palau attempted his ﬁrst kick. Imme-
diately following this, Bill Stapulis’
quick-kick was blocked, but sopho-
more tackle George Delich fell on the
ball for the Panthers on Pitt's 13.

In the second half Sorota and Dulkie’
got together on a lateral pass play
that netted 23 yards. Maniaci, who did
some classy running for the Rams,

‘ helped to continue this drive, which

ended as Glassford again intercepted
a pass.

This set the stage for the best Pitt
offensive effort of the day. Shedlosky,
Malarkey, and Stapulis carried the
ball, aided by two offside penalties, to
the Ram 20. Here a lateral pass went
the wrong way as the Panther lost
seven yards and the ball. As the third
quarter ended, Shedlosky ran back a
punt for 29 yards but as play was re-
sumed Druze threw halfback Leon for
a seven-yard loss to quelch that sortie.

A pass from Malarkey to Souchak
featured another attempt which
brought the ball to the Ram 33, but
Malarkey lost eight and a long forward
pass was grounded for another Pitt
disappointment.

Delich fell on the ball in midﬁeld
after a blocked punt, but Fordham in-
tefcéllted a pass to even up matters.
Maniaci started to go again and the
ball advanced to Pitt's 25. It was no
go through the Panther line and Pa-
1au’s kick was no good. The game
ended three harmless plays later.

Coach Loans Heavyweight Men
To Panther “B” Grid Team

At a boxing meeting held last Fri-
day in the YMHA gym, Coach Jack

quet to be held later in the season.

The banquet is to be held as a gen-
91‘a1 get-together for all the boxers,

attendance.

When_ the “B” football team of the

the boxing squad will see action be-
cause of a present lack of .material on
the gridiron team. ,

Coach Schricker requests that the

Pi Kappa Alpha
Beats Pi Lama
in Frat Football

Displaying a speedy and alert out-
ﬁt which was quick to capitalize on
the breaks, Phi Kappa romped off with
a 20-0 victory over Pi Lambda Phi
last Thursday to send the Interfra-
ternity touch football tournament in-
to the second round.

The two teams were more evenly
matched than the score might indi-
cate and it was two blocked kicks
early in the second quarter that def-
initely decided the outcome of the
game.

Blocking Fleish1nan’s attempted
punt from the 20-yard line, Phi Kappa
gained control of the pigskin two

yards from the goal line. After two
running plays failed to make any
headway, Bill Nickel dropped back

and tosssed a short pass to Johnny
Fogarty for the score. Jim Grigassy’s
drop kick added the extra point.

Grabbing another one of Fleisl1-
man’s unsucessful punts out of the
air, Bill Rock dashed ten yards for
the second six-pointer only a few
plays later.

After intercepting an enemy pass
and returning it deep into Pi Lam
territory, Bill Nickel heaved another
touchdown pass, this time to Bill
Corbin 011 the antiquated “sleeper”
play. Catching the Pi Lams napping
for the second time, the same com-
bination repeated the same play for
the point after touchdown.

The Pi Lam’s best offensive ad-
vance and the outstanding run of the
game was made by Ray Ehrman, bulky
lineman. Taking an intercepted pass
near his own goal-line, he scampered
down the ﬁeld for 47 yards, ﬁnally
being overtaken from behind three
yards from the last white line. How-
ever, this uprising Was repulsed and
the Pi Lams were unable to push the

ball over.

On the ‘same day in the Med League
competition, the Orchids battled to a
scoreless tie with the Little Potatoes,
but gained the decision with a mar-
gill of two ﬁrst downs to one.

on the hilly stretches of the Schenley
Park course, 17-38.

The Butler men had lost only one
meet before Saturday’s engagement,
losing only to Michigan State. They
held victories over Western State,
Purdue, Earhlin, and Ball State
Teachers College. Due to leg in-
‘juries, Winston Griffin, ace man of
the Butler outﬁt, who had not met
defeat in ﬁve starts, ﬁnished last in
the running.

Tost ran the four-mile course in 23
minutes, 26 seconds. He was close-
ly followed ‘by Alex Leggin and George
Cook, both of Pitt. Milton Weiner,
Butler, was the only one of the visi-
tors to ﬁnish among the leaders;

Franklin Theriault, Pitt; Charles
IG~roat, Pitt; Harland Tyner, Butler,
Ted Pruyn, Butler; Jack Emens, Pitt;
Henry Sackowitz, and William Olsen
of Butler ﬁnished in that order.

Despite the fact that the Bethany
College cross-country team took ﬁrst,
second, and third in the meet held
at Bethany Saturday, the Pitt re-
serves won the meet, 20-31.

Jack Brown won ﬁrst place in the
meet, running the short four-mile
course in 18 minutes. Brown was fol-
lowed closely by Folette, who ﬁnished
second, and Layton Horner, Captain
and Coach of the Bethany team, who
ﬁnished third.

The Pitt reserves won the meet by
placing men in fourth, ﬁfth, sixth,
and eighth positions.

 

Freshmen Defeat
State’s Lion Cubs

Chickerneo, Goldberg, Shea Lead
Drive For Only Touchdown

For the second successive year
the Little Panthers traveled to State
College to upset a highly touted Penn
State freshman team. With the Pitt
frosh shoving over a touchdown early
in the last quarter to win, 6-0, Coach
Mil1igan’s proteges won their ﬁrst
game of the season

Neither team was able to get within
striking distance of the goal in the
ﬁrst half and the better part of the
third quarter. But with the, ball

resting in midﬁeld nearithe end ‘of "

the third period, the Little Panthers
began a drive which resulted in the
only score of the game.

With Chickerneo, Goldberg, and
Shea doing the ball carrying duties,
they advanced the ball to the ﬁve-yard
line as the third quarter ended. On
the second play in the fourth quarter
Chickerneo plunged over the line for

 
    

the score. The attempt at the extra

point failed.

Everyone Called A Winner

in Freshman Cage Tonrney

 

Novice Basketeers End Successful Week As Carlson
Hands Out Praise, Advice, And Ice Cream

VVith a bang louder than the one with which it started, Dr.
Carlson’s annual novice tournament ended Friday afternoon at the
Stadium, thoroughly stamped with the usual Carlson trademark of
success and plenty of it. Approximately 40 novices and about ten
chiselers remained until the grand ﬁnale and the ice cream treat.

The tourney, which started last Mon 9

day, wound up the biggest success
ever attained by Dr. Carlson in his ef-
fort to spread sunshine to the new
Freshman class. Over one hundred
novices, freshman and otherwise, took
part in the four-day affair. Due to the
Pitt-Fordham game, the leaving of the
band for New York, and Friday’s late
classes, the ﬁnal day’s attendance hit
a new low, yet managed to end in a
ﬁtting conclusion.

In a manner that indicated, “Who
are these varsity guys anyhow?” the
four games run off on Thursday after-
noon showed some ﬂashy basketball.
The headlining game, the Cash and
Carry affair, was a dog ﬁght from the
opening whistle, with the Cash outﬁt
proving themselves strictly money
players by carrying away a 28-27 ver-
dict. Coffey led the individual scor-
ing with 11 points.

Taking the cue from this game, the
Flat Feet and the I. E. Cops tangled
in another close game, the Flat Feet
steping on the Cop crew to crush
them, 32-28. Koesel and Richardson
were the Flat Feet boys who cracked
the most skulls, sharing the scoring
honors with ten points apiece. Fable,
with 14 points, tried to make a differ.
ent story of the matter for the Cops
butmissed by four markers.

Five Aces Win

, Two tourney records were broken in
the Cinders and Sinners
Cinders scoring 35 points as a team
and Sheiding sinking 20 points to take
the tourney’s individual scoring crown,
Shelling was the biggest cinder in the
Sinner’s collective eyes, as the Sinners
took a holiday and a 35-21 whipping.

In the opening game of the ﬁnal
day, the Five Aces called the Full
House aggregation, found that it was
bluffing, and raked in the pot in the
form of a 24-19 victory. This game fea-
tured teamwork rather than individual
play, with the result that two of the
Full House cards, Sheldingand Mulvi-
hill, and one of the ‘Five Aces, Swiner,
tied for the high point total each with
seven.

The ﬁnal game of the tournament
provided the greatest game of the

fouls by Lindsey in the last two sec-

favor of the Du Ken team, 34-33.

Peet’s Collitch trailed at the half,
23-13, came back in the ﬁnal period
to take the lead, 33-32, and then lost
out in the last two seconds by Lind-
sey making good both of his foul shots.
It was one of those games where the
action gained momentum as the game
progressed and left the climax un-
til the last second.

Before closing the tournament, Dr.
Carlson spoke to the ice cream eating
novices on what he hoped the novices
received from the tournament. As the
doctor saw it, everyone of the novices
was skilled in the mechanical side of
playing, such as passing, dribling, and
shooting. The thing that was lacking
wasthe spiritual side, the faith in
one’s own ability, the willingness to
work and cooperate. Dr. Carlson
stated, “There is material here to
make champions if only you freshmen
can combine the mechanical and the
spiritual sides of ‘basketball. Your re-
ward for your part In this tourney is
the fun received, the new contacts and
friendships made, and the ice cream.”

Langley Harriers Top
Little Panthers, 23-32

Bonorati’s triumph in the triangular
meet between the “B” «Frosh harrier
team and the Langley and Peabody

High School squads was not enough
to give Coach Potts’ boys a victory,
as Langley won out by a nine point
margin.

The meet was held over the new
course that is to be used for the City
championships November 7, and the
All-State meet November 23.

VVith only half of the “B” team
present, Langley won the meet by to-
taling 23 points to the “B” team’s 32.
Peabody, with only two men present,
failed to register.

The freshman cross-country team
will meet the South Hills and Taylor
Allderdice High Schools in a triangu-
lar meet this afternoon. The Taylor-
Allderdice outﬁt is reported as being
one of the strongest cross-country
teams in the city.

Coach Potts is trying to determine
how strong the team is as a possibil-
ity for the ICAA meet to be held in
New York November 18.

Alumni Magazine Features

Article Cu Faculty Rooms

Dr. Gabbert Describes
Modern Facilities
Of Club Floor

The October issue of the Alumni Re-
view, official alumni publication of the
University, is now in the mail to all
alumni subscribers.

The center of attraction, not only
of the Cathedral, but also of this
month’s publication is the new Fac-
ulty Club. Dr. Mont R. Gabbert, pro-
fessor and head of the department of
philosophy, in his article explains in
detail the features, advantages, and
purposes of this new addition to the
University.

The Faculty Club quarters occupy
the entire seventeenth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, the first floor of the new
building to be completed. Through
the cooperation of the Board of
Trustees, the administration, and the
faculty, many new tasteful and com-
fortable facilities have materialized.

Space has been provided on the ﬂoor
for large and small dining rooms, a
club office, a large lounge, and a game
room. As an example of modern dec-
orative treatment, the color scheme
of the foyer is lacquer black with sil-
ver trim. The main dining room is
ﬁnished with the more subdued color-
ing of mottled tan, black, and cream.
The McNicol china is edged with Uni-
-versity colors of royal blue and gold.

Both the academic and social life
of the faculty are amply provided for
in the new facilities; committee meet-
ings of the faculty and administration,
presentation of scholarly papers,
meetings of the Women’s Association
of the University, and evening parties
are some of the functions carried on
in the club. As proof of the popular-
ity of the Faculty Club, the member-
ship has increased from 140 in May,
1935, to 300 in June.

As another feature of the Alumni
Review, Mr. Wilbur D. Hockensmith,
one of the leaders of the active West-
moreland County Pitt Club, gives an
interesting story of the history of the
Pitt football teams in “The Good Old
Days.” Special notice is also given to
plans for Homecoming Week, the
Army-Pitt Conclave, and the proposed
plans of the proposed Alumni Party
trip to California for the Pitt-Southern
California football game.
