New Pennsylvania law cracks dovvnion kennels

by Estelle Tran
A_.r.v[.Itant New Erlitor

A law passed last week could
save the lives of countless dogsin
commercial kennels in Pennsylva-
nia, which is knownas the “puppy
mill capital of the East.” But not
everyone agrees with the law in its
entirety. - ‘

The state Senate passed House
Bill 2525, known as “the Dog
Law,” with amendments by a 49-1
vote on Oct. 8, and Gov. Ed Ren-
dell signed the bill into law Thurs-
day night The bill’s main sponsor,
Rep. James Casorio, D—\Westinore—
land, worked on the bill formore
than two years. _

He said that— he and the public

are eager to put this law into effect, H

citing a May 14 rally in Harrisburg

for new kennel regulations.

S ‘We are looking for a compre-
hensive and massive overhaul of
this outdated and antiquated law,”
said Casorio. “It’s - a bi-partisan
issue. It’s part of a pledge to im-
prove the conditions for dogs.” 7

- The law works to ensure that
dogs in commercial kennels have
cleaner, larger primary enclosures.
Commercial kennels are facilities
thattsell or transfer more than 60
dogs to dealers or pet shop owner
each year. i '

Dogs in these facilities will also
be guaranteed daily exercise outside
their holding enclosures as well as
access to fresh water. 24 hours a
day. Many kennels will also have to
expand the sizes of their holding
enclosures and replace wire ﬂoor-
ing, which can damage the dogs’

feet, with solid flooring.

The Senate’s amendments in-
cluded the establishment of a
canine health board, made up of
veterinarians and animal health ex-

perts, to decide when exceptions to
the regulations are acceptable. An-
other key amendment gives com-
mercial kennel owners one year, in-

stead of 180 days, to improve their
facilities. , V
Though the law targets large
breeding kennels, smaller kennels
also will be required to have ﬁre ex-
tinguishers and space for exercise.’
Casorio is careful to distinguish
between kennels and negatively
associated puppy mills, which "are
common in central and eastern
Pennsylvania. The difference, he
said, is in the number of dogs
housed and the overall condition
of the kennel. R _

“ Some of the problem facilides
are hundreds of feet long and hold
thousands of dogs, he said. ,

“Some [facilities] have no elec-
tricity and no protection from the
aelernents,” said Casorio. ‘”I'hey’re
cruel and barbaric.”
However, some people don’t

support the law in its entirety; The
Pennsylvania Veterinary Medical
Association voiced some con-
cerns. '

_ The organization argued that
solid ﬂooring is not preferable over

ﬂooring with openings for drain-
age. - a

“Solid ﬂooring creates unsani-
tary conditions for the dogs housed
in commercial breeding kennels.
Even with diligent efforts to keep

the primary enclosure clean, mul-
tiple dogs urinating and defecating ‘

on the floor at various times dur-
ing a 24-hour period make it irn—
possible to ensure that the primary

enclosure will remain clean,” said‘

the association in a statement on

its Web site.

. A Casorio argued that solid ﬂoor-

ing would be better than the cur-

W recalled a time a farmer had to use \_,tin snips

‘to cut off the swollen leg of a dog that was

caught in wire ﬂooring. Another bill the state I
government is investigating, House Bill 2532, — —~

would make such actions illegal.

. A "Casorio said wireﬂooring is hazardous to _

the animals’ health. ’ ' ' L _ 5
. “I say that it is unsanitary now as it stands.

i It sometimes can be lethal,” he said. “[Metal-

cages of dogs are sometimes] stacked 15 to
20 high on each other, so excrement runs,
down ‘to the bottom.”

The recently passed law demands that
g  enclosures rest no higher than 12

inches off of the floor  are not stacked
upon other cages. , V V ' ’_'
V The law also calls for allotted time each
_day for ‘the dogs_ to be released from their
holding enclosures to run‘ around in aspace
that is at least twice the size of their holding

* containers. " u - e
i This point troubles the Pennsylvania

Veterinary Medical Association. According
to a release on the group’s Web site, the as-

I . sociation supports_ an exercise requirement
outside ‘of e  enclosures. However, the ‘e
_ group said itis concerned that dogs will be

7 forced to‘ exercise'outdoors, even  extreme
weather conditions.’   T if ' .' ,  '
' . i Tracy, Wu, a Pitt senior and vice president
of Pitts pre-veterinary. club,,said she agrees

. with: the_ -Pennsylvanian ‘Veterinary Medical

‘ ‘ Association that dogs do, not have to get

their exercise outdoors, V
i A “‘I guess‘ they could’ have indoor areas,”

7 said Wu. “I went to a vet’s office, and they

hadtan area in the lbas,ement,,Va concrete play

: area where dogs could be let outhperiodically’

iv to play with each other.” i.
g ,Wu said that when jdogs don’t» get to move
around, their muscles. suffer from atrophy.

 

   

H “Like humans, dogs ‘need fresh air and

sunlight,or they’ ll get lifeless and depressed,’’,

than the dogs’ heads while standing and wide
enough for the dogs to lie down.

Legislators are also considering imple-
menting regulations to ensure that kennels

is have  ventilation to let odors escape and to
prevent condensation. -Kennels will also. have i
to remain between.50 and 85 degrees if clogs "

are present. V _ . -
Casorio said that in some cases, when
«holding enclosures are cleaned, kennel own-

. ers donft remove the animals, and the clean-

ers may spray dogs with cleaning chemicals.

_ _ Under Pennsylvania’s old dog law, com-
mercial kennel owners aren’t subject to the
same restrictions as other citizens. They can

. euthanize dogs _without veterinary assistance.
' Casorio cited an, incident»-in Berks County
this month where. two ken1;1el'owners legally§

killed 80 dogs: _ L .‘
K “Dogs are treated as commodities, wheth-

er it’s a pencil or a_ desk chair,’:’ he said.

, He said commercial kennel owners some-
times use plastic pipes and sledge hammers_

A she said.‘ “It’s like if you put a human in a box

so they couldn’t move around” I / A
Kennel owners will now have to provide _

'~ enclosures that are at least 6 inches higher

to. break dogs’_ vocal chords, so they .can’t.

bark. _ T
If thedog. laws are passed, Casorio ex-
pects the'Pennsylvania Department of Agri-
culture and its wardens to enforce the laws.
Wu said that ‘dog kennels should comply

iwithpublic opinion despite the extra costs
.of larger enclosures and cleaner facilities.

“I think the general public thinks that’s a
good idea because they care about their ,pets.
And they don’t want their dogs in a‘ kennel

‘being mistreated like that,”_’said Wu. “You
 choose to do. that business, so you have to’
‘ take care of the an1m' als.’’-> ' " i

sheets of paper and wrote down their ideas

U.S. government and the United Nations,

Palin's troopertroubles
Gov. Sarah Palin’s. ethics slip—up

  a Sign ofpooir leadership

Gov. Sarah Palin said on Sat-
urday that she was “pleased to be
cleared of  any hint of any kind
of unethical activity” regarding
her actions in the Troopergate
controversy, i according to the
Washington Post. But Palin can’t
talk her way out of this scandal.

A recent investigation by the
Alaska legislature has concluded
that Palin abused her gubernato-
rial powers by inﬂuencing subor-
dinates to try to get state trooper
Michael Wooten, her former
brother—in—law, ﬁred.

to ﬁre the trooper’s boss, Alas-
ka’s public safety commissioner
Walt Monegan, she violated the
Alaska Executive Branch Ethics
Act, which forbids state ofﬁcials
from involving personal matters
into their political actions. The
investigation said that Palin and
her husband’ Todd tried “to get
Trooper Wooten ﬁred. for per-
sonal family related reasons,” ac-
cording to the Post.

Palin has repeatedly denied

I this, saying that Wooten acted in-

appropriately as a police ofﬁcer.
But the situation is highly suspi-
cious. At the time, Wooten, who
currently still has his job, was go-
ing through a rough divorce and
child—custody battle with Palin’s
sister Molly McCann.

The investigation report fur-
ther states that Palin “permitted
Todd Palin to use the governor’s
ofﬁce and the resources of the
governor’s ofﬁce  to continue
to contact subordinate state em-
ployees in an effort to ﬁnd some
way to get Trooper Wooten
ﬁred.” ‘ '

T» Perhaps Palin doesn’t know
the meaning of the ‘word “un-
ethical,” because, clearly, ethics

While Palin had the authority-

were the last thing on her mind
in her efforts to dismiss. Woo-
ten. '

Her husband’s role in the
controversy is disturbing. As

the self—described “first dude”“’

of Alaska, Todd Palin has acted
like he has executive authority in
Alaska politics.

According to the Los Angeles
Times, Todd spent much time in
the ‘governor’s ofﬁce, attended

The ease with which Palin

Presidential debates useless to voters

by Molly Green
Cola/n/ziat

Like a good little socially con-

scious American, everything my.
government professors ever told ‘

me to be, I have been watching
the presidential debates, or more

accurately, presidential tantrums

—— because, frankly, they are a
mess. Candidates have disregard-
ed the time constraints, the topics
and the moderators and instead
used their time as an opportunity
to rant about Senate records, ear-
marks and old pens.

" Never before have I seen de-
bates this out of control, and

 

— reminded the two candidates of

the one—minute discussion poli-
cies eight separate times, several
times mentioning that the can-
didates had signed off on these
rules. But even the great Brokaw
was no match in the end for Mc-
Cain and Obama, who evidently
interrupted him enough times to
earn some extra time for follow-
up questions toward the end of
the debate. A bewildered Brokaw
defensively added, “I’m just the
hired help here.”

Not only were the debates
essentially un—moderated, the
behavior of the candidates was
generally rude. There was much

grinding of teeth and smirking

the Commission on Presidential
Debates assured everyone that

' its new format guidelines would

make for the most “thoughtful
and in-depth” debates ever, ac-
cording to a CPD press release.

I The goal of this new system,
which, for the ﬁrst time ever, al-
lows for a free-flow discussion be-
tween the candidates, was to allow
for the candidates, unhindered by
strict_time constraints, to discuss

important policies in more detail. I

So far, however, these debates
have brought us more mudsling-

' ing and rhetoric than ever, and it’s
. ossible it’s actuall because of
P Y

the new. restrictions.

What’s that old saying‘  you

they have been completely
useless to me as a voter.

In the ﬁrst debate, Sen.
Barack Obama and Sen.
John McCain repeatedly
talked over their allotted
time, moved markedly off
topic, interrupted each other
and kicked around modera-

Teddybear.

Oh, poor Lehrer. No
matter how many times he
tried, he just could not get
Obama and McCain to ad-
dress each other (instead,
McCain sassed back, “Are
you afraid I couldn’t ‘hear
him?”).

In the end, the debates
failed on many levels, but candidates are just more
-most of all because the I

candidates did not ad-

. dress the most pivotal

- questions the American
people want answered.

A give ’em an inch, they
. take a mile? ‘
Though one could ar-
gue whether the modera-
tors did a poor jobor the

aggressive this year, the
CPD’s- new system failed
in its main. purpose: to
allow for more. thorough
discussions.

used the “free-flowing
discussion” time to at-
tack each other, and usu-
ally not even on relevant
topics (earmarks, any-
one?). ‘
‘CBS News’ Bob Schi-

Repeatedly, Lehrer would ,
_try to refocus the debate back on
topic, stridently at ﬁrst and then
increasingly less so, until by_the
end of the debate, like a man who
had given up on living, he would
concede to the senators with ,a
meek “All right” (e.g. Lehrer:
“Sen. Obama,_you have a ques-
tion for Sen. McCainon that?”
Obama: “Well, let me just make
a couple of points.” "Lehrer: “All
right”). _

The second presidential de-
bate was less of a disaster, if

' only ‘because of Tom Brokaw

— thank goodness for’ Tom
Brokaw. The man knows when
to tell someone to shut the hell
‘ up, even if that someone happens
to be a presidential candidate. He

from both candidates, as well as at
least one time where they refused
to shake hands. I felt like I was
seeing politics for the ﬁrst time;
Real politics, I mean — the nasty
stuff people always told you went
on, but that most politicians were
smart or well-managed enough to

‘ hide.

I In the end, the debates failed
on many ‘levels, but most of all
because the candidates did not
address ‘the most pivotal ques-
tions the American people want
answered. ' \ .

It’s ironic that the debate
should fail so miserably this year,
because both Obama and Mc-
Cain have been lauded for their
dynamic ‘speaking abilities, and

effer will moderate the
next debate. A
According to MSNBC, Schief-
fer means to keep the candidates

in line,.warning, _“It will not em-

barrass me, if they go off ‘in a

different direction, to say, ‘excuse «

me, could you focus on the ques-
tion that I just asked.’”

This debate will have the two
candidates "sit at the same table,
close enough to touch each other;
According to MSNBC, Schieffer

hopes this “will-encourage more ‘

interaction.” This is pretty opti-
mistic. '
a I’m just hoping Schieffer ‘can

keep the two from scratching out ,-

Dear Editor,

Your misgivings about the criteria for Trojan’s sexual health study are

LetterstotheEditor

well placed, but don’t go far enough.

Handing out free -condoms sends college students precisely the wrong-
message. We’re adults, and adults are supposed to be responsible. Re-
sponsibility entails going out and paying for what you need. We pay for
our meals (most of them, anyway). We pay for our books. Can we not pay '

for our condoms?

Trojan’s idealized campus appears to be a scene more beﬁtting inclu-
sion in the director’s cut of “Caligula.” The executives of Trojan doubt-
lessly hope that college students are all depraved nymphomaniacs reck-
lessly wheeling from one sexual partner to the next. Handing out free

condoms’ only helps them achieve this perverted scheme.

If you want to teach students responsibility and prepare them for th_e
. outside world (and, the last time I checked, this is supposed to be a goal
of colleges), then stop the‘ free condom program. Make studentstake .
responsibility for their desires and actions and go buy a. pack
way people outside of college do. _
And, if that leads to more STDS, tough luck. That’s life, suck it up and
‘ deal with it. We allow students to fail academically when they make poor

choices, so let’s permit them to fail sexually, too.

A better measure of sexual health is commitment to single sexual
partners. Then we’ll see if students really understand sexual health. Con-
dom 'veawa s can onl at most mask the issue and do more harm than

Dear Editor,

Upon reading Brandon Pfeffer’s column “There’s more to life than a Nobel Prize,” wewere shocked
and embarrassed by Pfeffer’s blatant ignorance and failure to grasp the depth of the Prize’s signiﬁ-

CQIICC.

Nobel Prize as an institution.

Helen Parks and Kira West
School of Arts and Sciences

/

’ Pfeffer begins by implying that Nobel believed he would end international conflict with the invention
of dynamite, when in fact it was Nobel’s massive guilt over the destructive potential of dynamite that
prompted him to create the Prize as a way to recognize man’s more noble achievements. Pfeffer discred-
its the Peace Prize for its “questionable nominees,” including Mussolini, Stalin and Hitler. Had Pfeffer
properly researched-his column, he would have.known that nomination requires only the support of one
qualiﬁed individual. A list of such individuals, who range from government officials to history profes— ,
sors and former prizewinners, can be found rather quickly on the Nobel Prize’s Web site. None of these
individuals are associated‘ with the Nobel Foundation itself, and thus, it is the laureates selected from
among the nominees, and not the-nominees themselves, whoreflect the opinion and sanction of the’

Pfeffer’s disdain for the 1994 Peace Prize, which honored the men who orchestrated  signed the
ﬁrst Israeli—Palestinian agreement in which any Palestinian faction recognized Israel’s right to exist, ap-
palls us. The fact that those’ men have also performed horrible deeds during the longstanding conﬂict
between Israel and Palestine does not negate the enormous achievement of the Oslo Accords, for which
the Prize was awarded. Putting this gross lack of research aside, it was Pfeffer’s discussion of the scien-
tiﬁc prizes that truly made us livid. Scientists are often wrong; It is part of the process of discovery. The
fact that some scientiﬁc prizewinners turned out to be incorrect has ndrealrelevance to the fact that at
the time the prize was awarded, therecipients were doing highly signiﬁcant work. i

In light -of both Pfeffer’s column and Giles’ Howard’s recent abomination regarding STAND, it

_ seems The Pitt News sees it ﬁt to publish columns suggesting that anything happening outside the direct
sphere of inﬂuence of this campus is not worthwhile. A student publication that’s major headline deals
with sorority housing issues and that, then lambasts the signiﬁcance of the Nobel -Prize using poorly
researched, facts, days after suggesting that student protesting of genocide on another continent is silly
and futile, is an embarrassment to the University. P

Dear Editor,

»

I am writing in response toiThe Pitt News’ coverage of the presidential and vice-presidential debates. Every four
bates, leaving pundits disputing pointless gaffes rather than important issues facing the United States. .

We all wonder why our “greatest” leaders leave us_out to dry on theissues that matter. The answer to the problem lies in the company that controls the debates. The majority of
Americans do not know that the Commission on Presidential Debates hosts the presidential debates. Don’t let the name fool you: They area private company, run by Frank Fahren-
kopf, a former head of the Republican National Committee, and Paul Kirk, a former head of the Democratic National Committee. They purposely excludethird parties — creating
a dull, anti-democratic, parallel interview. Both candidates sit down with the commission and pick what they wish to discuss. Because of this, their soundbyte responses possess the

years we are stuck  the same boring, substance-lacking de-

same amount of substance as an episode of “Dora the Explorer.” The narrow dialogue that has strangledour voices inevitably leaves countless issues unaddressed.

To make my point even more clear,llook, at the bailout bill. Both candidates voted for the bailout bill that passed, yet no substantial provisions, oversight or crackdown was in-
cluded. As a result, the economy continues to plummet. Our candidates rewarded reckless corporations for putting the United States down the drain, and now they are drowning
in our money. We can’t even ask them why they blindly supported the bill. Why won’t the moderators ask them why they voted for it? Is it because the candidates requested not to

discuss it? How can that be justiﬁed? At what point does it go from "we the people” to “they the corporations?”

Such immoral acts can only exist for so long until our entire system collapses because of the corporate greed that eats away our civic rights. We must open the debates and never

allow the dialogue of our country to be controlled by such tyrant forces. This is a‘ slap in the face toiour values, our culture, andrnost importa_ntly,_our democracy. .

You may now kiss your part-
ner in this civil union — wait, that
doesn’t sound right.

It doesn’t sound right to a ra-

Barack Obama and Sen. John

sounds just dandy. Heck, they’re
already on their way to the recep-

meaningless answers. But whether

ghe boys like it, same-sex marriage.
‘(and the civil unions that go with
it) is a critical issue in this election.

Civil unions could, potentially,
give gay couples the rights of mar-

ried straight couples —— rights that‘

affect things like hospital visitation
and shared insurance. A
McCain, though hesitant to
take a definite stance, appears to
oppose such civil unions. He ada-
mantly and repeatedly has opposed

he would prefer to leave the issue
up to individual states.

Whﬂe Obama supports same— i

sex civil unions, he opposes gay
marriage. . t
H Denying gaycouples the right

to be considered, legally married -

might seem trivial if all other ben-
efits that straight marriedcouples
enjoy are allowed. “Why are peo-
ple so picky.” ask those opposed
to same-sex marriage. “It’s just a
name.” i

This situation, however, is not
one in which people are being

picky. It isn’t a matter of a 12—year- '

old refusing his mother’s home-

McCain’s idea sounds all right,
though: If the residents of a state
don’t want to live beside Chuck

and Larry, why should they? Plus, —

if the federal government asksthe
states to decide the issue, they’ll
wash their hands of the whole

problem. .

This, unfortunately, is not a
practical or a moral solution. ‘If
states were currently permitted to

vote on what rights black people, A

women or immigrants had within

their borders, there would be a

nation-wide uproar. It might turn

a new character into the world of the-

by Randy Lieberman
Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
took sole possession of first place in
the Big East this weekend, knocking
off conference foes DePaul, 3-2, on
Saturday and Notre Dame, 3-1, on
Sunday. .

The Panthers (1_2—8, 5-1) rod
Kelly Campbell’s game-high 16 kills
against DePaul and 22 kills against
Notre Dame to thevictories.

“We regrouped [after a loss to
Georgetown] and found our rhythm
against a DePau1 team that was play-
ing really well,” said Pitt coach Toby
Rens. “We started off playing ﬂat,
but then really got it going in games
three, four and ﬁve” ‘ '

victory. I’

But an even more important
game awaited the Panthers in South
Bend. i‘

“It wasn’t like we overlooked
DePaul,” said Rens. “But certainly
the bigger match was against Notre
Dame.” e

In a tough, hard-fought match,
the Panthers earned the victory in
four games I

It was the first time ir1 the last five
matches the Panthers did not play a
fifth game.

“I think the match was a great
measuring stick,” said Rens. “Notre
Dame has been the hottest team in
the Big East, and they were picked
ahead of us in the ‘preseason. Plus,
they were a tournament team last
year.”

Defense fails Pitt on the road

i '~  by Ben Duignan

Sta W/riter

There’s no question that superb
defense has led the Panthers to

where they are at this point in the"

season. In nearly every game this

J year, the men’s soccer team has kept

the score close, giving it a chance to
be in the game.

But it was different on Sunday.

The Panthers lost, 4-1, against
No. 15—ranked Notre Dame in
South Bend, dropping their overall
record to 6-5-2, while their Big East
record fell to 2-4-1.

Pitt’s only goal of the game came
on a self—goal by Notre Dame senior
defensemanjack Traynor, giving the
Panthers the early 1~O advantage.
After that, the Irish went on to score
four consecutive goals.

‘We were totally outplayed in the
first half,” said Pitt coach Joe Lux
bacher. ’

Even, though the teams were
knotted at 1-1 at the half, the Pan-
thers were outshot 9-1 and 6-0 on
corners. But Pitt came out a differ-

ent team in the second half. 

At one point in‘ the second half
the shot totals were 11-9 in favor of
the Irish. The renewed Panther at-
tack .wasn’t enough to keep the op-
position off _ the hoard, however, as
the Irish tallied  to make it 241.

I wasn't disappointed with
the effort. Our guys came out
and fought hard, never quit

the entire game.

 

Joe. _

“We gave up a horrible goal. In

fact, we gave them a goal,” said Lux-
bacher of the Itish’s second strike
to put them ahead. Notre Dame
scored again in the 80th minute to
bring the score to 3-1.

“We threw more people for-
war ,” said Luxbacherof his team’s
strategy ir1 the closing minutes of

the game. g
The aggressive offensive strategy

 

allowed the Insh to tally once 
in the ﬁnal minute, to give the game
its final 4-1 score.

The Panthers also suffered a key
 in the game when an Irish for-
ward collided with senior star goal—
keeper Eric. Barnes. Barnes’ status
is uncertain for Saturdays match—up
against Georgetown. 1

Even though the loss is disap—ii

pointing, there isn’t time for the
team to get down. The Panthers
are still very much in Big East title
contention, only three points from
second place in the conference.
“Even though the loss was disap-
pointing, I think the mindset of this

._ teamis very good,” said Luxbacher.

“I wasn’t disappointed with the ef-
fort Our guys came outiand fought
hard, never quit the entire game.”
The Panthers will face George-
town at Founders Field on Saturday.
Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

1 “Every game is .a new game,’_’
said Luxbacher. “If we win, we’re
going to move up. Whoever brings
their A—game on Saturday. is going
to win.” ~ ‘

Philly fans know the truth:

Singer, page 15 j A
hold from making our own judgment until all

of the evidence is presented. - 

Exhibit A: Basketball

Philadelphia hosts six Division I college
basketball teanis, but ﬁve — the St Joseph’s
I,-jlawks, Temple Owls, Villanova W/ildcats,
Penn Quakers and La Salle Explorers ——
make up the most historic group of teams in

the sport’s history.

The Big Five boasts 59 ‘conference titles,

11 Final Four appearances and four.National V

Championships. While Pitt’s 1941 Final Four
appearance and two pre-tournament NCAA
titles are just ‘adorable, the "numbers are pa-
thetic compared to Philadelphia.

But again, it’s aboutlmore than just the
titles. The Palestra, Penn’s basketball arena, is

P It's about more than 

ground zero for contests between any com-
peting Big Five rivals. There’s no environ-
ment in the world —e let alone, in Pittsburgh
—— that compares to 4,000 Villanova fans and
4,000 St. Joeis fans dividing the gymnasium
right down the middle during their annual

‘ “Holy wet.”

The Cathedral of College basketball, as
some call it, also hosts six museum exhibits
dedicated to the history of the sport.

The history and character of Philly sports
exhibited in this stadium alone _ which has
hosted the most NCAA men’s basketball
games and the most NCAA Tournament
games than any other arena  the country —
makes anything Pittsburgh has to offer look"
junior varsity in comparison.

Speaking of basketball, the 76ers’ three

national titles, most of which came in the
early part of the 20th century. It’s produced

‘legends like Dan Marino, Tony Dorsett and _

l\/like Ditka. ‘ . V pp _

Philly? It’s lone Division 1» school’ -is
Temple, which was so awful for such a long
period of time that it got booted’from the
Big East. And. the Big East isn’t exactly a
power conference these days. _

Philadelphia’s most recent title comes
in- the form of college basketball, from.
Villanova in 1985. Villanova is a success-
ful program, but Pitt has overtaken‘ the
W/ildcats as a Big East force. Pitt has made
the NCAA Tournament seven straight sea—
sons. ' '

Philly might have the Big Five, but those
schools haven’t lit the world on ﬁre either.
Saint ]oseph?s and Temple have ' decent
teams, but aren’t among the top 40 pro-
grams in the country.

Throw in that Pittsburgh’s fans relate
to theiriteams as part of their culture and
identity, with a base that spreads through-
out the nation, and you have a top—tier
sports city. .

Philadelphia’s fans boo more than th
cheer, with a notorious reputation for neg-

ativity. Even Pirates fans aren’t that bad.

When youtally up the  score, Pitts-
burgh blows out Philadelphia. And it isn’t

even close.

championships and 11 division titles —- in

addition to playing host to the careers of
Hall of Farmers like Wilt Chamberlain, ju-

lius Erving and Charles Barkley —- remind _

us that the mere presence of a professional
basketball team puts Philly sports on a totally
different level.

Exhibit B: Hockey

ln_a 2005 report, “The Sporting News”
named Philadelphia the nation’s best hockey
town. That shouldn’t have surprised anyone.

While the Penguins and Flyers tie with
two Stanley Cups each, the Flyers double

V both the Penguins’ division and conference

championships. But in Philadelphia, it’s
about more than just the titles. A

In Pittsburgh, the Pens have ‘faced a few‘
instances of almost being forced out of ‘
town. In Philly, we embrace hockey as the
lifeblood of our city.

I During the NHL lockout, Philadelphians
turned to their minor-league hockey team —
yet another institution I,can’t seem to ﬁnd
anywhere within Pittsburgh citylimits —— to
get their fix of competition on the rocks.

The Phantom’s response? A charnpion—
ship season, during which Philadelphia set an
AHL single—game playoff record” of 20,103

I fans inattendance. The Philadelphia Phan-

toms weren’t playing for a Stanley Cup. And
in a way, they weren’t even playing for the
Calder Cup they won. They were playing for
a city.

Exhibit C: Everything else

The Steelers have ﬁve championships, the ' V
Eagles have three (1948, ’49 and ’60. Look it

up.). Good for the Steelers. But Philadelphia
offers an entire world of sports — and from
those sports, champions -——— that Pittsburgh,
for the most part, neglects. .

baro and Aﬂeet Alex would leave anything
Pittsburgh has to offer in the dust, and the

boxers like Joe Frazier, Joey Giardello and
Bernard Hopkins. '- '

Speaking of boxers from Philly, I know
I promised not to mention “Rocky,” but I
lied. ' . 0

There’s something about “Rocky” that
many Pittsburghers seem to be especially
disgusted with. Perhaps they’re just sick of
all the references, perhaps they’re jealous
that it’s better than any sports movie filmed
in their hometown.

'R0cky', a filmfor the ages

But whatever the reason, Pittsburghers,
please understand that Philadelphians don’t
love “Rocky” because it takes place in Phila-
delphia. Philadelphians love “Rocky” be-

cause it embodies the never-give—up spirit’

thatrepresents not only Philadelphia, but
America. ,

So for all of you Pittsburghers out there
who brandish your “one for the thumb,”
maybe you’ll just never get it. But, hopefully,
you too can one day see just how American

I
.

21

it is to smile -— instead of roll your eyes —

- when you watch Rocky recite, “Maybe I can’t

win. Maybe the only thing I can do is just
take everything he’s got. ‘But to beat me, he’s
going to have to kill me.”

Philly’s heart lies not within the trophies
of its athletes, and Philly’s passion cannot
be found within the pages of the record
books. The wins and losses will come with
any sport, but in Philadelphia, that’s all part
of the fun. —
