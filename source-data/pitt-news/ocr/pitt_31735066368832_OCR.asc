WASHINGTON—President Car-

ter announced to the world last
night that a “framework for peace”
in the Middle East had been
reached at his summit meeting with
Egypt’s Anwar Sadat and Israel’s
Menachem Begin.
Flanked by President Sadat and
Prime Minister Begin, "he said
documents to be signed by -the two
leaders “will provide that Israel
may. live in peace within secure
borders.”

Carter said Israel would withdraw
its forces from the West Bank of the
Jordan River and permit ' the
Palestinian Arabs now living under

ylsraeli occupation to determine

their own future. _
On the Sinai front, Carter said,

Israel would withdraw its forces
quickly, with the result being
establishment of diplomatic rela-
tions between the two old foes in a
30-year conﬂict.

Carter's appearance with Sadat
and Begin at the White House was
nationally televised.

The U.S. president, looking back
on 13 days of “long negotiation,”
acknowledged that at times the
talks faltered, and it seemed the
patience of Sadat and Begin would
run out.

But - Carter said the
exceeded all expectations.

Sadat, speaking next at a
ceremonyin the White House East
Room, thanked Carter for fulfilling
his commitment to serving as a ‘ ‘full
partner” in the talks. ,

Sadat expressed gratitude‘ to

results

Can broadcast i month

WPGH-~ Radio . Needs $5400   F romSG I ToRemuin   On Air

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer
WPGH, Pitt’s student-run radio
station, can continue to broadcast
for only one month unless the
St_udent Government I Board
approves a $5400 appropriation
request, station manager Jeff
Couch told the SGB during their
meeting Friday afternoon.
Couch made a long plea for the
funds needed for repairs to the
station's carrier broadcast system.
He argued against the Allocations
Committee recommendation that
therebe no payment to WPGH since
there is no money available in SGB
coffers.

“We are operating on less than a 4

9!

full carrier system, said Couch.
“We need $5400 to be able to
broadcast to the people we should
be broadcasting to.” . '

Couch also contended that the
carrier current system is needed to

prepare disc jockeys for the planned

— changeover to an open air system.

“Modiﬁcations made on the
carrier system can't be maintained
much longer. As you know we are
trying to go open air, and the carrier
would -give us a medium to train
personnel.”

SGB member Stan Gilanski, who
also is a WPGH announcer, favored
funding for another reason.

“I.look at this from a different
perspective,” Gilanski said.
“We’re not even close to getting an
open air station here. The question‘
is whether we want a student-
operated radio station at Pitt.”

Bruce Stefan, . an Allocations
Committee member, opposed

Couch’s request’ because he be-.

lieved it to be illegal according to
SGB regulations.

“I think this is an illegal
request,” Stefan said. “They
(W PGH) are asking for an allocation
that was already rejected.” ’

After hearing the comments on
WPGH’s request, the SGB voted to
return the proposal to the
Allocations Committee for recon-

‘ sideration. The board plans to hear

the request again Wednesday after
studying possible funding alter-
natives. '

This is the second time WPGH
has asked for funds _' this year.
During the regular allocations
hearings this spring, the station
sought $13,000 from the SGB but
received only $5000 to be used for
the foundation of an open air
station.

WPGH now uses a carrier current
system that consists of broadcast
booths in Schenley Hall and small
transmitters in the dormitories and
the student union connected by
telephone lines. The transmitters
only broadcast a signal within their
respective buildings. To change to
an open air station like any
commercial station, WPGH must-
win a - lice_nse from the Federal

K

Carter for his ‘spirit and dedica-
tion” and concluded with a prayer
that the “spirit ofeCamp David”
would mark a new chapter in Middle
East history.

Begin, in a tribute to Carter, said,

-“He worked harder than our

forefathers did in building the
pyramids of Egypt.”

Before there is. peace, Begin
noted, Israel and Egypt have three
months of negotiations ahead to
conclude a peace treaty.

Turning to Sadat, the Israeli
prime minister said there was no
point in recounting the “saga” of
their differences during the nego-
tiations. ’ ‘

Carter said the framework can be i

used. later by Israel to negotiate
peace treaties with her other Arab

Disc jockey Rick Hulme may, be off the air in a month unless the SGB approves WPGH’s $5400 allocation request tor-
repairs to their broadcasting system. The SGB returned the request to t
and should rehear the proposal Wednesday.

' Communications Commission.

The SGB heard several other
allocation requests tabled during
summer hearings at their meeting
Friday. The Amateur Radio
Association was the only club heard
that formally challenged the budget

the SGB Allocation Committee
proposed for them.
Amateur Radio Association

representatives Mark Bell and
Harry Bloomberg objected to the
deletion of funds for mail and
telephones from their request. The
Allocations Committee opposed
these expenses because they felt
the funds for mailing were for QSL’ s
cards, which the committee con-
sidered a personal expense, and

All three- smiled and waved as
they boarded the aircraft at Camp
David. Carter climbed in first.
Begin deferred to Sadat and urged
the Egyptian leader to board
second. The three men and the
helicopter were lit by a glare -o
ﬂoodlights. ’

When the helicopter touched
down on the White House south
lawn, the three leaders were
greeted by some 50 dignitaries and
members of the White House staff.
Each of the three got a kiss from the
president’s wife, Rosalynn.

Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd said Carter asked to explain

the agreements toa joint session of.

“You may look on QSL card

Bell.‘ “You don’t allow outside
phones or mailings and this puts us
in a bit of a bind, when we want to
contact companies about pur-
chases.” »

After hearing the Amateur Radio
Association arguments, the SGB

Pitt News Staff Writer
Newly-appointed Dean of the
I College of Arts and Sciences Dr.
:. Irwin J. Schulman is still hesitant to
as predict the future of Pitt’s
 loosely-structured liberal arts cur-
1. riculum, one than has been the
_r target of constant fire from
 members of the administration in
_ recent years.
 Schulman’s. predecessor Dr.
- Robert Ma'rsh'all,"who resigned ‘last
~ year, had launched a strong
A campaign against any reversion to
" the traditional liberal arts curri-
 culum prior to his resignation.
.;-_ “There is a limit to what a clean
 T can do,” Schulman said in a recent
 '— interview. “I have my own ideas,
_ which do in fact disagree sharply
_ with Marshall’s, but after discus-
"3 . sion with faculty and administration
officials the outcome may be
radically different from what my
I suggestions might be.”
When asked to offer more
:3 speciﬁcs of what such a change
] A would entail he offered only vague
 fgeneralities, stating that whatever
_ the change it would be aimed at
 “offering a more complete liberal
_ arts education for Pitt students.”
;_ Schulman warned that simply
 ‘V revising the curriculum cannot
 ensure a student population that is
more proﬁcient in basic learning
skills. The former political science
professor said such a problem is too
 deeply rooted in other factors to be
 the sole basis for a curriculum
' change.

“When speaking of a curriculum
change, I don’t mean a complete
step backwards,” Schulman said.
“What I do mean is that when
students leave the University of

pi1’*¢_hllQh. they should ave

Schulman Offers No Specific Curriculum Plan

to the fullest——to be able to read the
best literature and listen to the best
music—not living only to become
victims of the world but rather
makers of it.”

The first-year dean also stressed
that his first obligation will be to the
students and faculty, insisting he
will not be manipulated by the
University. Upon his selection to fill
the vacant slot, much speculation
suggested Schulman might have

been selected because of the close

correlation of his views with those of
the administration on such issues as
curriculum changes.

“I will always be representative
of the students and faculty, keeping
in mind what I believe to be their
best interests,” Schulman insisted.
“I don’t believe that I was

appointed to be the administra-

tion's boy or anything of the sort.”
Despite the conﬂicts between
Schulman’s predecessor—who was
very popular among the student
population—and the administra-
tion, the dean believes few clashes
will arise between the needs and
requests of students and the
administration's demands. This, as
Marshall learned, will be one theory
that may have some difficulty
standing up in actual practice.
"This issue that dominated
Marshall’s five year term was

discussed by Schulman when he.

offered’ his opinion on the
long—disputed controversy of
whether faculty research and
publishing has taken precedence
over quality teaching at Pitt. '
Schulman believes Marshall’s
approach to the problem was
wrong. He said Marshall looked at
the question only from the point of

view of a humanities_ professor.
while he almost totally ignored the

plight of natural science professors

who must be committed to research
if they are to remain active
members of the scientiﬁc com-
munity.

“I ‘feel that Marshall vastly
oversimplified the problem. The
entire question is a hideously
complicated one that has no easy
answer,” Schulman said. “There is V
a type of intellectual vitality _that can
be shown in both . research and
teaching with each being equally
valid.-?-’ V  ...  .

Schulman cites the political
science department, one he claims
has both an outstanding research
and teaching record. He stressed
that in a department such as this,
those who have published a great
deal are generally considered the
best teachers.

“It is those who have the time to
publish and at the same time teach
that are the great teachers in my
mind,” Schulman said, not admit-
ting that research and publishing in
any way takes time from professors
who might ordinarily use it catering
to the needs of students.

' Schulman attributes the de-
creased enrollment for the fall term
1978 to Pitt’s poor public image as a
quality educational institution.
To attempt to improve this image
Schulman has undertaken a series
of programs aimed at making the
residence halls a more integral part
of the University. He also plans to
add a performing arts festival into
the Universities calendar of activit-
ies.

“The problem with Pitt is that it
really isn’t a college except on
paper)’ Schulman said. “It doesn't
have a character of its own.

It will be mv fundamental iob to
create a college that students will be

proud to attend now and return to as
alumni. ’ ’

Schulman added that the success

of Pitt in recruiting students lies
entirely in the hands of the new
admissions staff that replaced the
former staff that Schulman termed
“inadequate.” The new dean
added that the staff’s first job will
be to ‘ ‘let people know that they can
get a first-class education at Pitt”
and secondlv to build a sense of
campus cohesiveness once students
are here. Schulman said the
problem of students dropping out of *
school has become alarming over
the ast years.

Speaking about what he would
like to accomplish during his first
year as dean of CAS, Schulman
offered only’ sketchy but far-
reaching goals once again.

“Pitt is potentially a very
distinguished University with dis-
tinguished faculty making, it
potentially one of the most
outstanding universities in this part
of the country. It’s my job to make
sure that it lives up to it’s
potential,” the new clean con-
cluded.

Begin, Sadat Agree On Withdrawal, Autonomy  

LI (Continued from page 1)

starting as soon as six months from
last night and the return of Sinai

airfields .to Egyptian civilian‘

control.
It commits both Israel and Egypt

to agreeing to a treaty within three
months, with a maior Israeli

withdrawal three to nine months‘

after the treaty is signed.

After the first Israeli with-
drawal, the two countries agreed to

establish normal diplomatic rela-I
tions, the administration ofﬁcials
said.

The ﬁnal Israeli withdrawal is to
take place two to three years after

the signing of the peace treaty. The

treaty also is designed to provide

~ security zones for Israel in the Sinai

as well as a program of arms
reduction in the area.

The major disagreement on the
Sinai is the fate of Israeli
settlements in captured territory.
The officials said Egypt demands
that Israel remove the settlements.

The agreement on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip is much less speciﬁc,
reflecting the difficulties in that
area.

In that agreement, the ofﬁcials
said, Egypt and Israel agree to a
ﬁve-year transition period during
which “the inhabitants will attain
full autonomy, but Israel will be
able to station troops in specified
bases in both the West Bank and
Gaza areas.

The framework leaves unsettled
the issues of the ﬁnal between Israel
and the new Palestinian entity and
whether that entity will be a state,

an" affiliate of _Jordan or something
else; .
The countries involved will

invite Jordan to join their negotia-. —
tions along with representatives of .

the Palestinians living in the two
territories. Jordan also will be
invited to play a “security role”
during the period. Israel commited

itself to establishing no new_

settlements in those territories

during the negotiations, the off-I

icials said. ' V

Black Monday’ Haunts Youngs’rownYecIrLdter 

By The Associated Press

YOUNGSTOWN, 0hio—In the
summer of 1977, John Koruschak
was called into the supervisor’s
ofﬁce at the Youngstown Sheet &
Tube Co.’s Campbell Works to
receive his 25-year gold watch. He
joked about having “a lot of‘ time
on my hands,” and_ everybody
laughed.

A few weeks later V“it was all
over,” he now recalls. “The joke
was on us.”

Sept. 19, 1977—a year ago
Tuesday——was the day Sheet &
Tube shocked this steel city by

announcing it was closing the bulk -

of the aging Campbell Works. That
put 4,100 persons out of work.

I In Campbell, a Youngstown
suburb where some 13,000 people
live and 75 percent of the municipal
revenue came from the mill and its
employees, they call that day
“Black Monday}?

A year later, shock waves are
still felt in the Mahoning Valley. A
plan for workers and the commun-
ity to acquire the plant has brought
attention, but it will remain
visionary unless the federal gov-
ernment comes through with
massive loan guarantees. Mean-
while, Campbell braces for the
coming weeks, when unemploy-
ment beneﬁts end.

Campbell has had a $639,000
state aid grant and Harry McFar-
land, city administrator, says the
city is trying to attract new
business. But, he adds, “I keep my
ﬁngers crossed every day that we
can meet the payroll and keep
going.” Today, the city ﬁnds itself
“depending on the" government. . .I
do not like that.”

Koruschak remembers Sheet &
Tube as “a good company to work

for._” But like most steel jobs, his in A

the soaking pits was specialized.

He remembers the intense heat.
“I could put an apple on the shelf
in the morning and have baked
apple for lunch,” he says.

Koruschak drew more than $800
every two weeks. “It was the best
job I could have had there. I felt I
could take it easy until I retired,”
he said. '

Then came Black Monday. With
the others, he was out on the
street.

Koruschak and many others are
bitter, and the bitterness is
directed at Lykes Corp., which took
over Sheet & Tube in the late

' 1960’s.

“We felt we got the shaft,” said
Koruschak. “Lykes comes in
without any money and buys up
Sheet & Tube on credit...They
milked it. After two or three years,
they wouldn't repair anything, just
tried to hold things together with
Scotch tape and wire.”

Sheet & Tube, by contrast, said_

the aged mill couldn’t compete
with modern plants and was losing
money. ' V

Whatever the explanation, the
shutdown hurt.

Koruschak said that at ﬁrst he
“ran around like -a chicken with its
head cut off.” He had always kept
busy with hobbies and work around
the house. But, he said, “I didn't
know what to do. There’s the
feeling that nobody wants you. You
feel like a lost soul.”

With the local job market .

glutted, he went to California and
found “two or three places where I
could have had a job in electronics

. if I had more training.” Electronics

had been a hobby.
Meanwhile, he was drawing $661

in unemployment beneﬁts and

‘posed a plan to

picking up a little side money as a
performer by combining electronics
with another hobby, magic. “You
have to have a gimmick to make
your act different,” he said. His
was summoned from the wings,
after he made a real rabbit vanish.

Finding a steady job at 58 was
not as easy as making rabbits
appear and disappear for Korus-
chak. He enrolled in a federal

a study saying reopening and
modernizing the plant are feas-
ible—if the government comes
through with massive help, inclu-
ding $300 million in loan guaran-
tees.
* The Rev. Edward Stanton,
coalition spokesman, said it is now
up to the Carter administration
whether the plan goes forward.
The coalition- says its campaign

retraining program, and ﬁnally, (4 has $4 million in bank accounts,

last July, started an electronics
course at a school in nearby Niles.
When he graduates next May, he
feels sure he will be able to get a
job, but that may mean moving to
Califomia—“if I can talk my wife
into it.”

John Spagnola, state employ-

ment service manager in Youngs-
town, says Koruschak is not alone;
more than 300 Sheet & Tube
workers are in federally funded
training programs now.

All the displaced Sheet & Tube
workers do not share Koruschak’s
optimism. Dan Eshenbaugh, 22,
who worked four years at the blast
furnace, said he has two weeks of
beneﬁts laft and when that $127 a
week stops, “that’s it, then I have
nothing.” He said he has been
“looking hard‘ for a job, but they’re

I not hiring anywhere. ’ ’

A , religious’ coalition has pro-
reopen the
Campbell Works under worker-
community ownership, but" Eshen-
baugh says the steelworkers he has
talked to don’t think it will work.

Russell Baxter, president of
United Steel Workers Local 2163, is
skeptical, too, but adds: “You have

to give the ecumenical coalition a A

lot of credit for making an effort to
do something.”
Last week, the coalition released

showing support. Depositors can
withdraw the funds, but presum-
ably money ‘that remains could
.become part of a private invest-
ment of $30 million called for in the

plan.

At the same time new shocks are
expected—layoffs of 1,200 more at
Sheet & Tube after a recently-
approved merger of Lykes and LTV
Corp., and eventual closing of U.S.
Steel facilities employing 5,000.

H 1: . Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo—whose name

'_ does notexactly conjure up visions of ‘jthe City of
' Brotherly Love”—has already added more than one

new wrinkle to the idea of representative govern-
‘ ment. Now, by engineering a November referendum
-that would amend Philadelphia's city charter and
' allow him to seek in 1979 the third term he covets,

_ . Rizzo is further threatening the efficacy of the elec-
. tor‘al process, as well as adding an unneeded com-

plication to the current gubernatorial campaign.
- It may or may not be fair to say (as one local writer

 A recently did) that Rizzo ,“has fostered a crack-first,

question-second attitute among Philadelphia
police.” But there can be little ‘doubt that civil rights,
especially minority civil rights, are a lot less impor-
tant to Hizzoner than his rather authoritarian con-
ception of “law and order.” A 1

Rizzo’s mayoralty has also, according to many,

' ‘A largely polarized the Philadelphia citizenry. Much of

the division has been built along racial lines, and
already-problematic class and ethnic antagonisms
have been aggravated by the Mayor’s policies and

,pro'nouncements (witness his handling of the MOVE J

incident this past summer). As a result of this in-
crease in tensions, some Philadelphians are beginning
to fear a reenactment of the violent protest that swept
American cities just a decade ago. For Rizzo to seek
another term under these circumstances is, we think,
not only ideologically unpalatable, but irresponsible
as well. I

Quite apart from Rizzo’s personality and politics,
however, is the question of the referendum itself. The
Philadelphia city charter presently limits the mayor
to two terms, and Rizzo’s attempt to abolish that
limitation has already drawn fire from various sour-
ces, including both the Republican and Democratic

- , candidates for Governor. Flaherty and Thornburgh-

oppose the charter change because, as Flaherty said,

_‘‘The two-term limitation is a principle that prevents

the perpetuation of power.” The two candidates’
concerns are well-founded and understandable given

.theI;_American experience and the'electorate’s

traditional suspicion of political power, even if the

would-be governors are really more worried about .

Rizzo’s personal grip on Philadelphia than they are
about any “principle that prevents the perpetuation
of power.”

But perhaps even more important than the
problem of power here is the usefulness of limited
terms in helping to ameliorate the effects of what de
Tocqueville called “the tyranny of the majority.”

It is possible that politicians, if they are not given -

the chance to face electoral judgment within the next
few years, will find it easier to make some of the un-
popular yet necessary decisions that are entrusted to
them in a representative government. The enhanced
possibility of such principial—rather than self-
interested—-politics may not be of any use in Rizzo’s
case, but events on the national level (i.e.,
Congressional inability to deal responsibly with
energy and environmental problems) argue strongly

for political structures that will help officials to make’

decisions that require a‘ reluctant majority to make
sacrifices for the good of the whole or that mandate
the sharing of societal benefits with minorities. Term

‘limitations can provide a useful political tool, and

this should be kept in mind when they are threatened
by a referendum—especially a
engineered by someone for his own personal gain.
Finally, Rizzo’s decision to run in 1979 could have
a profound effect on this year’s race for governor.
Because of the strong feelings elicited by Rizzo’s
candidacy, and because the November referendum

rgRizzo’sI‘{"eiferendum: More Bad News for Philadelphia

supporters and detractors are likely to show up in‘

large numbers at the polls this fall. This would nor-
mally bode well for Flaherty since Philadelphia is a
heavily Democratic district, but Flahertyehas come
out against both the referendum and the Mayor’s
reelection bid, and Rizzo could use his inﬂuence to
retaliate at the polls. Thornburgh, who is still the
underdog and who also opposes the charter change,
has kept mum since Rizzo announced for 1979,
perhaps hoping that Hizzoner will concentrate his
displeasure on Flaherty, thus giving a boost to the
Republican ticket. .

It is to be hoped that The Philadelphia Problem
will not prevent Pennsylvanians from electing
whoever is the best candidate for Governor in 1978.
Moreover, we hope Philadelphians will recognize a
useful political institution when they see one. To
defeat the charter change and send Frank Rizzo
packing would be just about the best think they could
do for themselves, and it would give needed en-
couragement to_those who still believe in the ideal of
good government.

exact entry point of the bullet that

blew the victim's brains out. The
 experts huddle around the exhibits, ,

incessantly taking notes, staring

intently at the charts and photo-

bullet or two that killed the man?

J Was it the work of a lone assasin or a

conspiracy? Was the assasin just

malevolent network. .
It could be the opening scene of a

There is no solution to this crime, no

fit all the pieces together. «

A. Fifteen years after the assassina- -

tion of'President John F. Kennedy,
experts still are trying to’recon-
struct the murder, to solve the

riddle. ’It is an impossible" task.

There are only two persons who
could answer all the questions about
that gruesome day in Dallas in 1963.
One is Lee Harvey Oswald, the
assassin who himself was murdered
before police were able to
interrogate him; the other is God.
Barring an appearance‘ by the
Supreme Being before the House
Assassinations Committee, we will
never really know the whole truth.

After spending some $5 million,

the House Assassinations
Committee is under pressure to
produce some fresh evidence. Since
1963, the ’Warren Commission and‘
two different teams of pathologists
have reviewed the autopsy report
made at Parkland Hospital in

Da1las.v The Committee, .after its.

own re-examination of the reports,
made onlyminor objections to the
ﬁndings. Only last week, a panel of
medical experts, y displaying the
President's bullet-riddled clothing,
supported the Warren Com-
mission’-s "finding that a single
bullet woundedboth Kennedy and
Texas Gov. John Connally.

The Warren Commission con-
cluded that Oswald, acting alone,

limou-sine, with one bullet missing it
entirely, one hitting both Kennedy
and Connolly and’ the jump seat
ahead, ’ and the third bullet
shattering the President’s skull.

The “single bullet theory” is the
most crucial . part of the com-

m.issio'n’s report. ' Conspiracy ,

theorists claim that no one gunman

. could have wounded both men with

separate shots in-the splitsecond
interval when they were hit. -
Since its issuance, the Warren

report has been under’ attack.

Through all the" questioning and
probing, however, the Warren
Commission’s report stands. It has
holes, gaping holes. But if Oswald
didn’t do it, who did? No one else
has been connected plausibly with
the crime. » -

‘ Almost no lead hasbeen too wild
for the’House committee to track
down. . According to Newsweek,
investigators have looked into a link
between Oswald and the Soviet
secret police. CIA officers who
worked in Japan, where Oswald was
posted at an airbase in the 1950s,

were asked for.any evidence that the _

KGB might have recruited Oswald.

Marina Oswald Porter has been
called up before the committee and
asked to speculate whether her
husband had planned the murder on,

‘his own. Connally was put on the

stand to dredge up memories of that
day. Doubtless his testimony and
any inconsistencies therein will give
the conspiracists fodder for their
continuous debates about the
single-bullet theory.

But after 15 years, one feels duty‘

bound to. inquire after the purpose
of the investigations, of the House
Assassinations Committee. Why
such a relentless search for

The KennedYAssassination Still Haunts S

accomplices? Kennedy is dead.

‘ More a myth to the American public

than a man. _ Why can't the
conspiracy theorists, the‘ U_.S.
Congress and the American people
accept Oswald as the murderer and

I let it go at that?

In part, it is possible they fear the
implications of the lone assassin
conclusion. To admit a president of
the United States was killed in _a
random moment by‘ an armed
moron would underscore their

— sneaking fear that life is senseless

and cruel, and that history is made
by abspvure shifts and brutal
accidents. ‘ .

In a society increasingly concern-
ed with controlling and analyzing
the forces of nature and the makeup
of man’s social and psychological
mind, it is important to find a reason
for such a violent act as
assassination. Uncovering an
elaborate conspiracy would give the
assassination a point. It would not,
however, make it any easier to bear.

If the committee seeks to ferret
out perpetrators of purposeful
violence in the Kennedy assassina-

tion, it is wasting its time and the '

taxpayers money. The trails in the
Kennedy assassination are cold.
The details are impossible to clarify.

The committee’s hearings have
produced a grisly, fascinating
drama. They have provided fodder
for endless debate in both the press
and other mediums, but they have
proved nothing. The public remains
frustrated.

The story has a great plot, but no
resolution. /Even Sam Spade
couldn't solve this one. It's time ‘to
admit defeat, close the case and

T

Always Controversial Mayor Rizzo
Readies for Charter Revision Fight

By the Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA—MayOr Frank
Rizzo, banking on the success of a
proposal to revise the City Charter
to allow him to serve a third
consecutive term, was back among
the people, promising to save them
from a “bunch of ultraliberal
idiots.” A

It was the same Frank Rizzo who
in March said, “I will not run‘ for
mayor,” and put forth instead an
ambiguous plan to become a
national spokesman for the white

majority.

are, Announcing his change of heart,

Rizzo went before local and national
television audiences last week to
begin his campaign. He said he was
against busing of school children to
achieve racial integration—“when
the kids ride a school bus for three
hours they don’t learn nothing”—
and against racial" quota systems,
federal housing and federal courts
he says are trying to run the
country. .

“Hogwash,” he said when asked

‘ about charges he is a racist.

At age 56, the mayor, a hulk of a
man who speaks in thunderclaps
and frequently jousts with repor-
ters, is facing one. of the biggest
political ﬁghts of his life. If the
charter isn’t changed to delete the
ban on more than two consecutive,
majoral terms, it could well be his
last. '

However, Rizzo’s political obit
has been written dozens of times in
the past, and always he has
survived.

He’s a Democrat who once was a
Republican, a man who called
Richard Nixon “the greatest

' president this country ever had,” a

man who, according to a polygraph

test, lied about a political deal in a I

hotel men’s room, but a man whoto
many is the last hope to right all that
is wrong with this country. _
SO they stick with him, most
shot-and-beer people from ethnic

 

neighborhoods rooting for one of V

 

their own—a man whose father
immigrated from Italy, and, who
like his son, became a policeman.
During the summer, Philadelphia
experienced a garbage strike and a

‘ teachers’ strike, and ‘Rizzo was

clearly visible in the solution of
both. He came to grips with a band

of radicals called MOVE, who for .
rattled his .

Over a year had
reputation as a city boss who didn’t
back down to anyone.

Then, more than a month ago,
without ceremony, the Committee
to Reform the Charter—actually an
arm of the Democratic City
Committee-——opened up head-
quarters on Walnut Street.

Today, it bustles with staff and
volunteers typing, phoning and
mailing literature to potential Rizzo
supporters. If the charter change
makesit, the mayor's name will be
placed on the Democratic ballot in
the spring primaries of 1979. Two
other men, Albert Gaudiosi, a
former Rizzo aide, and Charles
Bowser, a Philadelphia lawyer, also
have announced‘ on the Democratic
ticket. The Republicans are playing
wait-and-see.

' Rizzo was in ﬁne form last week.
A spit shine rode his big black shoes
and his powerful neck bulged from
his white starched shirt as he waded
into crowds snorting about the
“vi1lians” from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
who wanted to mess up neighbor-
hoods with low income housing.

- “They . have no roots,” he
shouted. “They go into one
neighborhood, tear it up, move on to
another. I will do battle with those
people who want to tell you how to
live even though they don’t live in
your community.

“If they’re going to do anything

in this city, they've got to get by me, . '

and they haven’t got by me yet.”
On television he said: “I’m as
liberal as anybody when it comes to
human rights. But I’m tired of
talking to young police officers who

were passed over for promotion by
fellow Officers who scored lower on
tests.

“They ask me why they weren’t
promoted and I say, ‘Oh, I thought
you were.’ Later, I ﬁnd out it was
because of the quota system.

“The courts in this country are
running government now. The Bill
of Rights was never interpreted for
the courts to tell us what to do in our
community, but they’re doing it
now.” ‘P ' ‘ '

As Rizzo moved about the city,

aides handed out orange and blue
“Yes!” buttons, instructing voters
to okay the charter change.

In his old South Philadelphia
neighborhood, women kissed his

Satellite Plunges to Earth

By the Associated Press

WASHINGTON—-Pegasus 1, one of the largest satellites
ever shot into space, plunged back into the earth’s

_ atmosphere at 2:12 a.m. yesterday over northern Angola,

the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.

NASA had predicted about 21,000 pounds of the satellite
and its attached rocket stage would burn up from re-entry
heat, but about 1,600 pounds, broken into perhaps hundreds
of pieces, might survive and hit the earth. NASA said the
danger of anyone being hit by debris was slight, and several
hours after the re-entry there were no reports of even a
visual sighting of the satellite.

Lab Theatre's ‘Finnegan'sWoke'—Confusing Script

By JOHN RIGHETTI
Pitt News Staff Writer
Finnegan’s Wake:
Directed by Bill Royston

_ ‘,_‘Fi_nn.egan’s W_a_ke”_is an Irish
allegory of the falland‘ redemption

of mankind——if you can get that out

of this choppy, fast-paced produc-
tion.

A Leon Katz adaptation of the
last part of James Joyce's novel by
the same name, the play is so
difficult to follow that spectators
are handed a short synopsis of the

dream, his twin sons, Shem and
Shaun, compete for the title of
savior, he who will lead the Irish
nation (and all mankind) out of the
night’s darkness into the glorious
morn. Shem, dressed in an Oriental
robe and sporting four arms, is_ the
exotic,’ the exciting." He brings joy
and previously unexpressed pleas-
ure to the people; he is Joyce as
writer. ~

Shaun is the embodiment of
everything typical and established,
the everyday occurences and
existence the people love. He,
therefore, is the embodiment, also,

story upon entering the theater. It
is of little help. ‘

The play is primarily the dream
of a Dublin pub keeper, Humphrey
Chimpden Earwicker. In the

‘Kennedy's Children’
A Successful Keynote

By MARK HOLAN

adapted to it.

The three-performance revival of ;‘Kennedy’s Children" _at Stephen
Foster Memorial was an excellent keynote to Pitt Theatre’s 1978-79
season. The play, which ran ‘successfully in June and was well received
during this short revival, employed the original cast and again was
under the direction of Tom Crawley.

The play is set in Phebe’s Place, a hang-out of off-off-Broadway actors
and actresses in New York’s Bowery. It is Valentines Day, 1974, and it is
raining. ' I

In the ensuing two acts, ﬁve characters, each seemingly different yet
in many ways similar, reveal their 1960s past and its toll in their 1970s
present. Though retrospect is an important element, “Kennedy’s
Children, ” according to its playwright Robert Patrick, is a play about the
’70s, not the ’60s. . ,

Carla, seductively played by Debra Gordon, is the sex goddess. She
thirsted to be like ‘ ‘her, ’ ’ Marilyn, and not like ‘ ‘them, ’ ’ Raquel and the
drag queens. But after years of failure, sleeping pills and a few drinks,
her dream died. I -

Barry Brunetti is Sparger, a gay actor in the ruins of New York’s
underground theater. Along with Carla, Sparger isjthe most satiric of
the characters. He crawls into the bar when he is not crawling into some
theater. He curses the vultures (no, “the piranhas”) that devoured his
friends,“ but he is drowning in their element.

Wanda is a middle-age groupie of the Kennedy clan played by Shirley
Tannenbaum. What she has forgotten is that it wasn't a rainy day in
New York when the president was killed; it was unseasonably warm.
And now, the “subnormal” children she teaches cannot seem to grasp
the magic of Camelot, not even for the brief moment that she and so
many others did in the_days of Jack and Jackie.

‘ Gayle Herring is the “hippi” activist Ronna. She provides the
‘audience with a year-by-year, people-places-and-events account of
American youth through the ’60s. But now things have been reduced to
the extremes of million-dollar heroes (Dylan) and junkies (her husband).

RSA Sponsors Self-Defense Course

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

The power of mind over body is
stronger than what most people‘
think, according to self-defense’
instructor Curtis Smith.

“There’s really no limitations to
what your physical being can do,”
said Smith‘, who soon will teach a
self-defense course to Pitt’s resi-
dent students. “If a person is in
total control of himself and strongly

believes in his own inner strength,
he can perform any physical act,
regardless of his sex, age or size.”

This power allows a person
trained in karate to split a concrete
block in half with his bare hand
without feeling any physical pain.

“He can do it because he has
blocked out everything ‘ else,
including the pain, and is thinking
of nothing but the act itself,” said
Smith, a 1976 Pitt graduate and
former Panther football player.

"“5Fhe-power of positive thinking
is important in all the martial arts, ’ ’
said Smith, tracing the reason to
their African and Oriental roots.

This mental aspect A will be
stressed in the self-defense course .

mereness of her existence. It falls
so heavily upon her that she, the
symbol of life, almost is choked to
death.

_What the second half of the play
has to do with theiﬁrst half is
indeed‘ a ‘-mystery:-‘But’.-botli could
stand separately on their own
merits. ’ '

The play’_s major faults are its
pace and language. The action and
dialogue happen too quickly for the
mind to grasp and understand. (But
then, are we supposed to under-
stand everything in a dream?)

‘The actors do an excellent job
with their Irish brogues and
syntax—so much so that they are
impossible to understand. A great
deal of the dialogue seems
gibberish. Maybe it is.

Despite these two setbacks, the
play has some strong attributes.
The cast is superb. David Crawford

Oates’ ‘ ‘Along the Red Ledge’ ’ LP, is such a song. For
in their latest work, the twosome has recommitted
itself to some serious music.

‘ ‘Along the Red Ledge” is reminiscent of the duo’s
1973 album, ‘ ‘Abandoned Luncheonette.” Five years
ago Hall and Oates revealed a sound with strong
elements of Philadelphia soul, yet they also were
innovative in their variety of vocal and instrumental
styles. They were progressive before progressive
music really came into force. The albums following
“Luncheonette” seemed to concentrate on rock and
soul. I

The music opens with “It’s A Laugh,” nice
harmonies and a rich sax by Charlie DeChant,
emerging. The supporting musicians, including Todd

work of Caleb Quaye and‘Oates add to" the"! overall
bluesy sound.

The second-side begins with a pair of gutsy, all-out I 2;
rockers, “Alley Katz” and “Don’t Blame It OnLove.” ‘ _
The spirited guitar work of Oates and Quaye nicely» .-

accompanies Hall's volatile voice, proving the
twosome can rock as well as anybody. ‘

Yes, “Serious Music,” clearly deﬁnes the
aspirations of the two musicians:

The album ﬁnishes with “August Day,” in which
Hall manages to paint a vivid musical picture in a

pleasant ballad. The album’s only dud is “Pleasure. . »
Beach.” Equipped with recorded cheers, the song ’

sounds like it belongs in a 19605 beach party ﬂick. It is
inconsistent with the spirit and theme of the album.
That aside, “Along the Red Ledge” is probably’

-Hall and Oates’ most important work in years.

Panthers Ride the Gree   a

By BOB LABRIOLA , *
Pitt News Staff Writer
NEW ORLEANS—Sometimes
even an ugly picture gets a spot in
the gallery.

The overall performance was
something less than a masterpiece,
but the Pitt Panthers used a_ blend
of swarming defense with just a

: touch of offense to etch a 24-6

victory over Tulane Saturday night
at the Superdome.

Only 32,658 turned out to see _

Gordon Jones conduct a clinic in
airborne acrobatics and break the
Pitt record for career reception
yardage with a 37-yard catch of a

fl?

quarter. Jones’ three receptions for
91 yards gave the senior All-
American 1,628 yards, which was
seven yards more than Bob Longo
accumulated in 1965-67.

In a preseason interview, line-
backer Al Chesley said that if
necessary, the defense would carry
the offense through the early part
of the season. In the ﬁrst quarter, it
did just that.

Pitt was able to amass only 38
yards in the ﬁrst period.(30 rushing
and eight passing), but 20 yards in
penalties‘ meant the Panthers
moved the ball forward 18 yards.
The Panthers’ three ﬁrst-quarter
points come on a 39-yard ﬁeld goal
by Mark Schubert when A five

running plays and an incomplete .

pass moved Pitt into range after a
24-yard punt by Tulane’s Frank
Wills. .

The Green Wave scored after
two errors in judgement by
Pitt—one by JoJo Heath and the
other by head coach Jackie Sherrill.
After the Panther defense forced

  

By the Associated Press

CINCINNATI—Quarterback Terry
Bradshaw, employing all of Pitts-
burgh’s offensive weapons, ﬁred
two touchdown passes and directed
a devastating Steeler attack that
rolled up 451 total yards in a 28-3

‘National Football League victory

l’7'iL

over the cincinnati Bengals yester-
day.

Bradshaw, , with 14 of 19
conpletions for 242 yards, tossed
touchdown passes of 28 and 12
yards to tight end Benny Cunning-
ham and wide receiver Lynn Swann
as the unbeaten Steelers won their
third straight game.

Rocky Bleir and Franco Harris
each scored a touchdown and
rushed for 75 and 73 yards
respectively and Cunningham
caught four passes for 107 yards,
while the Steeler defense limited
the Bengals to 56 yards rushing.

another Tulane punt, Heath ﬁelded
the ball on the run at his own
5-yard line and was dropped there.
Three running plays netted two
yards, and Sherrill decided to let
Dave Trout punt the ball out of the
end zone.

To that point, Joe -Gasparovic,
the regular punter, had kicked one
time for 44 yards, and Sherrill’s
decision to go with Trout, who had
never punted in a college game,
backﬁred when the sophomore got
off a poor 24-yard punt.

In three downs, Tulane could
only move the ball one yard
backward, but Eddie Murray was
still in range and set a personal
record with the 49-yard ﬁeld goal.

It took the Panthers just 1:25 to -

regain the lead, but the drive was
hardly artistic. Tulane’s Tom
Cheviot had Trocano sacked, only
to be fooled by a pump fake that
allowed the Pitt quarterback to
unload the ball -in the direction of
Fred Jacobs, with whom a Green
Wave defender interfered.

Two plays later, Larry Sims, a
starter in last year’s opener, burst
through the -defense, and dashed
35 yards for Pitt’s ﬁrst touchdown.

Roch Hontas, who became
Tulane’s all-time leading passer, -is
a sprint-out passer but spent much
of the night sprinting away. Greg
Meisner sacked Hontas on the ﬁrst
play of the game, which proved to
be something of an omen. Hontas
rarely was able to set himself to

.throw and spent much of the

evening avoiding the likes of Hugh
Green ‘and Al Chesley, a feat not
unlike -trying to dodge cars on a
busy freeway.

The quarterback problem re-

It was the third Straight,loss for

-Cincinnati, which has been without

quarterback Ken Anderson.

The Steelers bolted to a 14-0_
lead, scoring the ﬁrst two times they r

had the ball, with the touchdowns
coming 2 minutes and 25 seconds
apart. ’

After Larry Anderson returned
the opening kickoff 32 yards,
Harris rumbled 37 yards to
Cincinnati’s 26 on the Steelers’
ﬁrst play. Five plays later, Bleir
scored from 5 yards out around
right end. _

Rookiecornerback Ron Johnson
set up Pittsburgh’s second touch-
down by intercepting a pass thrown
by quarterback John Reaves on
Cincinnati’s ﬁrst play from scrim-
mage. Bradshaw marched the
Steelers 54 yards in ﬁve plays,
hitting Swann for consecutive gains
of 30 and 17 yards that propelled

l

- touchdown, ’ ’

mains just that after the first game;
neither Trocano nor Lindsay

-Delaney could play the other out of

a job. Trocano completed eight of
16 passes for 116 yards and one
touchdown, but Jones’ magic was
largely responsible for half of those‘
yards and the score. Delaney,
supposedly the deﬁcient runner,
read the option well and engineer-
ed a 77-yard drivethat gave Pitt a
17-6 lead as the half ended. An

ankle injury limited his playing

time, though.

Sherrill showed he has a touch of
the riverboat gambler in him by
scorning a ﬁeld goal attempt and
going for the touchdown with one
second remaining in the half and
the ball on the Tulane 3-yard line.
The gamble paid off when Sims
scored behind apicture block by
Jacobs.

“It was my decision to go for the
said Sherrill. “I
wanted to take the gamble, and it
paid off.”

The second half belonged to Jones
and the defensive "secondary.
Floating through the air with the
greatest-of ease, Jones grabbed a
Trocano pass in the midst of a
couple defenders for a 37-yard
touchdown. It has gotten to the

I point where no single Jones catch

is more amazing than another, but
rather each. contributes to the
foresight of the man who christen-
ed him 1“ Too Much.”
“You can look all over the

Harris, whogalloped for 60 yards
in the ﬁrst quarter, made it 14-0 on

The Steelers drove to Cincin-
nati’s 19 on their next possession,
but Bengals «linebacker Reggie
Williams recovered a Cunningham
fumble after a 9-yard reception.
Cincinnati then marched from its
39 to Pittsburgh's 16, settling for a

QB Situation ls Almost same

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staﬂ Writer

NEW ORLEANS—With one
football game already history, Pitt
head coach Jackie Sherrill is in the
same situation he found himself in
last year—only different.

After one. game in 1977 (a 19-9
loss to Notre Dame), Sherrill found
himself faced withthe realization
that defending the Panthers’
national championship of 1976 was
nearly impossible; few teams that
suffer an opening loss rebound

‘ sufficiently inithe minds of pollsters

to warrant a Nov. 1 ranking.

More important to Sherrill,‘

though, was the task of ﬁnding a
capable replacement for injured
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh. .

In 1978, Sherrill ﬁnds himself
with a different version of that
problem.‘ Instead of having to
search for one capable ﬁeld general,
Sherrill ﬁnds himself choosing
between two-+Rick Trocano and
Lindsay Delaney. i

In the sometimes puzzling world
of football, media and fans ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to accept two equally

talented quarterbacks on the same .

team. One has to be better; only one

deserves to start. Teams that have’
«three talented wide receivers are

said to be loaded. Teams that have
two- equal quarterbacks are said to
lack leadership. I V

Saturday night’s ' game with
Tulane was supposed to establish
either Trocano or Delaney as the
regular, but the events of the
contest’ prevented it.

Trocano was chosen to start and

was only partially effective through
the game’s first 27 minutes.
Missing on his ﬁrst three passes
before connecting with Rooster
Jones on a swing pass, Trocano
ﬁnished the half with a two-for-ﬁve
showing for 35 yards.

“During our ﬁrst offensive series
in the second period, I decided to
go with Lindsay if Ricky didn’t get
us in the end zone,” said Sherrill.

Trocanowas sacked attempting
to pass on third down, and Delaney
began‘ taking snaps from center
Walt Brown on the sidelines.

Delaney entered the game with
3:54 left in the second period and

immediately ‘put the ball in the air,,

but the pass fell incomplete. The
Panthers then went to their option
game, and Delaney, supposedly an
inferior runner, began to march Pitt
down the ﬁeld.

Delaney connected.on his next
two attempts—to Clifford Moore
and Ralph Still—and Pitt was in
business at the Tulane 1-yard line.
A Green Wave defensive lineman
rolled on Delaney’s ankel, however,
and the sophomore from Upper St.
Clair limped off the ﬁeld.

Trocano returned, Larry Sims
scored from the 3-yard line and the
speculation began: Who would
open the second half at quarter-
back?_ ‘

“Even if Lindsay hadn't gotten
hurt, we would’ve started Ricky in
the second half,” said Sherrill. “I
wanted to play Lindsay a lot more
than we did, but the ankle stopped
us.”

Trocano’s throwing_ improved in
the second half, and Delaney
seemed to have lost some of his’
magic touch when he returned in
the fourth quarter. The questions

persisted—which' was the real
Trocano; which was the real
Delaney?

. Neither played poorly enough tp
warrant a full-time seat on the
bench, and neither established
himself as the leader Sherrill has
been seeking since fall camp
opened. ‘

“It took us a while to get our
offense going and to adjust to some
of the things Tulane was doing
defensively,” said Trocano. “I
really don't worry about what
everyone’s been saying; I just go
out there and give it my best.”,

Sherrill seems to be taking the
situation in stride. ’

_ “I’m very pleased that we’ll be
able to play both quarterbacks,”
said Sherrill.

He might also be pleased if one of
his sophomore quarterbacks
stepped forward and took the
Panther offense by the tail.

Boaters Bounce Bethany

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pltt News Staff Writer .

Pitt’s soccer team rebounded
from Wednesday's sour defeat to
Akron by. routing defending NCAA
Division III champion Bethany, 4-0,

. Saturday.

The Panthers, powered by an
explosive offense and a hustling
defense, evened their record at 1-1.
The victory seriously hurt Beth-
any’s chances for a second NCAA
playoff bid and planted ideas of a

— Pitt playoff chance in the minds of

some Panthers.

The ﬁrst half was played in a
downpour that hindered scoring
opportunities. By the second half,
Pitt adjusted to messy field
conditions, scoring four unan-
swered goals.

Scoring began 14 minutes into
the second half when left wing Jeff
Tissue-drew the goalkeeper from

.his position and passed to right

wing Barry Stein, who scored his
ﬁrst goal of the season.

Three minutes later, the Pan-
thers were leading by two, as
Tissue once again came down the
left side and passed to midﬁelder

Bemis. “Our front line is- having

power.” A '

The Panthers didn’t sit on a 2-0
score, keeping the pressure on
Bethany. The third goal came when
left wing Jerry Buirge passed to
right wing Jedd Zaring, who took
the ball in for the ﬁnish. Buirge
scored the ﬁnal goal, with assists
going to Al Adelmann and Tim
Pearson.

While the Panther offense was
scoring goals, the defense kept
Bethany away from the Panther
nets. ‘ ' '

“The backs must be given much
credit,”'said Bemis. “They did a
great job in holding Bethany
