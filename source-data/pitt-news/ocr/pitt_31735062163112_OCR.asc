tests were performed. Now the
annual number is over 500,000.

According to Dr. Moran, the
number of tests now being con-
ducted could be doubled by in-
creasing the personnel. “This
will probably occur in the next
year /or two since space for-
merly occupied by the clinical
laboratories in Presbyterian and
Woman’s Hospitals will be con-
verted to patient bed areas,” he

» said.

Besides
tients, the -clinical laboratories
have educational and research
programs. Third and fourth-year
medical students at the Univer-
sity conduct some of the less com-
plex tests on their patients.

Eleven Specialize

Eleven g r a d u a t e physicians
specializing
cine and surgery are continuing
their practical education in the
laboratories.

Two students ‘Ware presently‘
enrolled in a 6-month training
course in cytology. The program
trains technicians to screen

Many other areas of research
are being conducted in the labora-
tories including the etfects of cor-
tisone on repair of damaged lung

Actually the Panthers’ track-
men were not even considered a
darkhorse in the race for the
crown. In a ivo team battle to the
wire, Villar ka nipped Penn State
1/2 point, 38-371,/2, to again
prove their runners have it when
the chips are down.

Once again Barnwell’s old

A lnemisis the staggered-laned 440

proved to be his undoing. After

drawing the first lane Barnell
misjudged the staggered dis-
tance and put" out too much
too early. With 30 yards left it
appeared as thought he tight-
ened, -his mistake earned him a
fifth, place.

James Wedderburn of New
York University won the event
in 47.4. “If Barnwell had run a
smarter race,” Coach Carl Rees
reported, “he might have won the
race. According to his past per-
formances he could have won the
_220-yard dash. I’m sorry for
Barnwell’s sake that I 'made _the
mistake of ifnisplacing him.” ‘

Rees, however, plans to correct
that mistake when he enters
Barnwell in the Nationals _this

month.

Co—Captain Ron Rush placed
third ir the 3,000 meter steeple-
chase in 9:3§.1. only eight sec-
onds off the winning pace set by
Bob Lowe of Brown. The water
jump troubled Rush.

Dan Kannel was the only other
Panther to place in the champion-
ships. Kannel was foruth when he
qualiﬁed on Friday but slipped
to ﬁfth in the Iinals with a toss
of 158’-6%”.

The biggest disappointment of
the day, as far as the Panthers
were concerned, came on the part
of shot putter Larry Och. Before
the championships ‘started, bar-
rell-chested Och possessed _the

third best throw of any of the
competitors. He only needed 51
feet to qualify but fell short on
every attempt.

Jim Donahue qualiﬁed for the
finalsin both the century and
220-yard dashes. Although he
failed to place he looked strong
in the six races he ran in two
days. Ed Vamos qualiﬁed for
the broad jump, 22’ 11‘/3”, but
didn't élace.

Regis Goggin reached the semi-
nals of the high hurdles and Bill
Hinchberger ran his fastest race
in the 880 run in 153.7. A fast
section eliminated Hinchberger

ported.

Cat Hopes For
Track Future
Grow Dimmer

By JACK SMITH

IIIIIIIIIIIUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII‘

. Most coaches agree that there are certain factors that
go—»into making a winning track team; Among these factors
are a recruiting system and competition.
' A’ few weeks ago Penn State’s track, team came here and
easily humbled the Panthers 84-47. This week State almost

‘ captured the IC4A championship._ Probably the greatest rea-

son for States past and present success is Coach Chick Wer-

.ner’s recruiting techniques.

- How Werner draws outstanding athletes like IC4A 100
and 220-yard” dash champion Bob Brown, IC4A mille cham-
pion Dick Englebrink, and Mel Ramel who placed second’ in
the IC4A high jump to world record holder John Thomas,

_ ‘is a mystery, even to Panther ‘Coach Carl Rees. It is evident
Y,-by the number and caliber of men that Werner places in each

event that he must be offering quite a few scholarships each

Pitt also awards scholarships, or should I say hands

3 them out in many instances to second rate performers.
The gift only covers tuition, hardly enticing to the better
performer. Bait like that couldn’t tempt the animal let
alone catch him in the trap. Pitt ‘reportedly awards on
the average of live track scholarships a year. If a boy
can live at home‘ and don’t require much aid they are
able to pick up -two runners for the price of one.

Granted Pitt has got some good runners like Speedy Mel
Barnwell, but one good runner and four other hopefuls’can’t
build a track empire‘, or even a small castle. Unfortunately

the outstanding Pennsylvania high school runners won’t be A

enjoying hash in the Schenley cafteria, so Rees reports.

V When Rees was asked why he is unable to attract local
high school performers like Leonard Johnson, New Castle
High School, who runs a 9.9 l00—yard dash, Fred McWermott
from South Hills High whoruns the 220-yard dash in 22.1
and the 440-yard dash in 50.3, he replied, “We just don’t of-
fer them what many of the other schools do. »

“State offers them tuition and then a fraternity will as-
sume the major part of'his expense. We don‘t do that at Pitt.

Track is a small sport here and we offer few scholarships.

)7

But when a runner does come to Pitt he is given a
new pair of shoes and toldlthat he should spend his fresh-
men- afternoons competing against a stop watch. For
some reason an athlete isn’t content to compete against
the round machine with dials. Coach Rees claimsthat
competition is necessary for a boy to improve, yet run-
ners begintheir varsity competition with those same

new shoes.

Underthese light will Pitt’s track fortune inmprove? No,
they won’t improve but they will remain the same? We doubt
that they will remain the same, but they may blacken.

There is still an opportunity
for all male students to join an
Intramural softball team. The
season has‘ just begun. Any stu-
dents wishing to join a team

Statistics bore out the cause
of the Panther baseball team’s
dull 7-12 season.

The Panthers had only one

man -hitting above_ .300. He,

was sophomore shortstop Pete
Suder who finished the season at
.406. Suder was followed by .a
freshmen second baseman, Bob
Corky Cuthbert who hit .291 in
his ﬁrst year of college ball. Cuth—
bert also led the team in stolen
bases‘ with four.

I In the rbi department. Ron
Lefty‘ Maser drove in 17 and was
followed by Suder with 13. A
.219 hitter, Nick Kartonas led the
team in extra base hits with nine.
His hits included three doubles,

four triples and two home runs.
He tied with Suder in‘ that de-
partment. . ‘

Dick Wirth proved to be the
Panthers topihurler with a record

of 3-3. His earned run average of
3.04, however was topped_ by Bob
Conti, 1-2, at 0179.

Schenley Cops .
Tourney Title .

In IM Softball

The Schenley softball team put
together solid pitching, hitting and
a forfeit to capture a pre-season
Intramural softball ’ championship.’

In the ﬁrst round of competi-_ 

tion Schenley knocked off the
Vets 16-0 behind the long ball
hitting of Clyde Kishbaugh and
Bruce Plasket and the two hit
pitching of Jack Smith.

Two days later Smith came
back to pitch "a ﬁve-hitter in

downing the Pirates,4-3, paving

the way to the championship en-3
counter. Schenley was behind 3-0

until the ﬁfth inning when they:

picked up all four runs behind the

clutch hitting of Chuck Dunbar

and Plasket.

Psi—Omega, also reached the
ﬁnals in thier section but failed
to produce enough players ‘for the
ﬁnal game and forfeited
championship.

Rodents, Monkeys
Subjected to Tests

Of Mental Powers ,

By MIKE DRAPKIN

The never- ending march of
science continues on its exper-
imenting way at the Univer-
sity. ‘

The scene is Clapp Hall
where a number of psysiolog-

'ica1 psychologists are engaged in

work concerning the brain. Rats,
monkeys, and cats are once again
sharing the spotlight with the

.work of the scientists.

Dr. Alan E. Fisher is currently
working on a project to determine
the relationship and signiﬁcance
of chemical stimuli on behavior.

Stimuli Sought ‘
At present about a dozen. sep-

-arate experiments are pointing to-

ward the goal of finding the rela-
tive impotence of chemical stim-
uli.

While these experiments are
being conducted on animals, a
connection may ‘be made with
human beings, especially in the
ﬁeld of mental illness.

Dr.
operate on the various animals,

I once they have been conditioned,
if and place electrodes and hollow

tubes into the portion of the brain
they wish to stimulate. "

Brain Recorded
At different intervals the brain

- is- chemically stimulated and the

results observed and, recorded.
The reactions are compared
against other animals as well as
other parts of the same animal’s-
brai_n which have been tested.

Monkeys are taught to work
problems which, if solved cor-
rectly, will result in the fulﬁll-
ing of a basic need in the ani-
mal-,—such as hunger or thirst.
, Other things_ studied by the sci-
entists besides the need for food
and water include -the maternal
and .sexual tendencies.
Equality for Males V

One hypothesis is that the male
and female brain is the same and
only the presence of lack of stim-

"ulating agents account for certain

behavior patterns. V
Dr. Fishexxis using maps of
the inner parts of the brain,
previously prepared in other
‘scientific work, to guide him in.
stimulating the right part of the
brain at the right time.
He describes the work as “An

‘attempt to. map out the circuits

for the ‘fPrimary Drive Behav-
ior’.” He [eels tha' he wants to

RATS OF THE WORLD UNITE!

Monkeys are stealing your jobs.
This’ monkey is not outﬁtted for outer space, but for an experiment
on the relative importance of chemical stimuli on the brain. (Rats
are beinggused ‘too in.12 phases of the project.) ’

ﬁnd out how the ‘primary cir-
cuits’ are formed and how they
react.

Dr. Fisher says he is very for-
tunate in that Clapp H'all.was not
yet ﬁnished when he started his
work here. “This allowed,” he
says, “for my staff and myself to
plan each room equipment-wise
to facilitate our experimenting.”

The addition now under con‘-

struction, at the rear of Clapp

Hall, will provide better operat-
ing facilities for Dr. Fisher, the
and the
sciences -in general to" continue
their research into the mysteries
andproblems of science._
