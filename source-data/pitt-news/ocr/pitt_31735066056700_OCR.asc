On April 21, 1992, 24-year-old Steve Rzeczkoxvski
woke up in St. Francis Hospital with staples where his
small intestine used to be and a button in his hand to
deliver morphine on request.

On May 8, the Pittsburgh native, with what he
describes as “tubes everywhere,” spoke to
Presbyterian University Hospitals chief transplant sur-
geon Dr. John Fung about an issue few can face or are
willing to discuss, especially at R’/.ec7.kowski’s age —
his own death and how he might prevent it.

Rzeczkowski said he only remembers two things
about his next surgery at Presby on May 28 — passing
out, thoroughly strapped to a table which resembled a
cross and more importantly, waking up again. He
received a new stomach, duodenum, small intestine,
liver,'pancreas and lease on life from an unidentified
15-year-old organ donor, becoming the second in the
world to successfully receive a five-organ transplant.

Because multi-organ candidates are often placed on
waiting lists separate from patients needing only one
organ, Rzeczkowski was able to receive his complete
package of lifesaving organs from a single operation as
quickly as his donor became available.

But a decision made after Governor Robert P.
Casey’s dual transplant by the United Network for
Organ Sharing, a non—profit organization which is
authori7.ed to oversee organ procurement and distribu-
tion for the Department of HeaIth—and Human
Services, took priority away from multi—organ candi-
dates needing a heart or liver.

“People are going to die needlessly," R’/.ec'/.kowski
said.

When Casey received a heart—liver transplant less
than a day after doctors diagnosed his need for both
organs, it released a torrent of media speculation.

Casey was the only name on a heart-liver list at
Presby. Ironically, he matched immediately with an
available donor, thus receiving precedence over
patients awaiting the individual organs.

As people questioned Casey’s receiving a double
transplant, Brian Broznick, of the Center for Organ
Recovery and Education, which handles organ pro-
curement for Western Pennsylvania and parts of New
York and West Virginia, said CORE simply followed a
local policy favoring dual transplants that has been
unquestioned by the national agency for 11 years.

UNOS challenged this particular procedure, which
had been performed before without inquiry, simply to
answer the publicity, according to Broznick.

orientation discrimination

By Robin Senor
Staff‘ Writer

John Michael Curlovich
hadn't encountered any prob-
lems at work — until he was
fired last year. In his two years
with Aspen systems, he had
received a number of promo-
tions, including a recent one
into management — but the
company’s move to bring in a
new department head changed

everything. _
“Everyone in my office knew
I was gay, so word got around.
She pulled me into her office
and basically told me that she
didn’t have room for a gay man
in her department,” Curlovich
said. '
Curlovich said he was then
demoted and later fired by his
supervisor on -the basis of his
sexual , orientation. He had
“been out” at his office since he

had taken a position in data
processing two years earlier.
Curlovich sued the company
for sexual orientation discrimi-
nation but decided to settle the

case out of court. Curlovich said -

he was “very happy with the
settlement.”

_“My decision to come out at
work wasn’t voluntary. It just so
happened that one day I was
sitting at a table with a couple
of female co-workers and a man

walked passed and one of the
womenl was sitting with made
a comment about him. I
agreed... and I was out.”
Curlovich said.

Until April 5 1990, Curlovich
or anyone in Pittsburgh could
not have taken the legal action
that he did.

At that time, Pittsburgh’s city
code chapter 651, which deals
with discrimination, was
amended to include sexual ori-

entation.

According to Curlovich,
Aspen had a policy banning
homosexual discrimination, but
it was ignored.

And being ignored is what

One of the best means of
reaching employers is also one
of the most direct _ making a

phone call. Yet developing an
effective telephone strategy is a
job—search technique often
overlooked by candidates.
Today’s column will cover the
main points to keep in mind
when you conduct your own
phone campaign.

There are two basic types of
job search phone calls. Follow-
up calls are made to a recruiter
after sending a resume/cover
letter, while Cold C61//SZlt‘€'1‘n2ld€
to potential employers without
the preliminary mailing. Cold-
calling is a technique that
requires equal parts of persis-
tence, timing ancl nerve and is
definitely not suited to all job-
seekers. Cold-calling may be
explored in a future column,
but today I’ll focus on follow-
ups.

First, keep in mind that a
phone call, like a resume and
cover letter, is primarily used as
a way of getting a personal
interview. Employers rarely, if

‘sometime dur-

ever, hire someone solely on
the basis of a phone conversa-
tion —~l face-to-face meetings
are always more effective.
When to call? Normally, it’s
best to wait about a week to ten
days after your resume/cover
letter mailing

response to make is that you
have sent some correspondence
to the recruiter and you are fol-
lowing up on that correspon-
dence. Remember that you’re
being evaluated as a candidate
from your first contact with an
organization;

before calling.
Make your call

ing the late
morning hours
and it’s best to
call midweek
rather than, a
Monday or a
Friday. All of
these tips will maximize your
chances of reaching the
recruiter or manager. If the per-
son that you are calling is
unavailable, ask the secretary or
receptionist for the best time to
call back. Generally, it’s better
not to run the risk of playing
“phone tag” by leaving a mes-
sage.

In some cases, your first hur-
dle to overcome is the recep-
tionist or secretary. If asked why
you are calling, the best

 

when speak-
ing with
receptionists,
always main-
tain a profes-
sional and
friendly tone.

When
you reach an
employer by
phone, remember that your
goal is to arrange a meeting.
Brieﬂy introduce yourself, refer
to the resume and cover letter,
quickly cover your major selling
points as a candidate and ask
for an opportunity to meet with
the recruiter. There are several
possible responses. You may
have the good fortune to be
exactly the right person for the
job and be scheduled for an
interview. Or the recruiter may
indicate that there is a compa-

I-'hLe right phone calls can riizg you in a job

ny-wide hiring freeze, or that no
positions are currently open. In
these instances, try to arrange a
brief, informal meeting in place
of the ‘interview. Indicate that, if
possible, you would like to
meet with the recruiteranyway,
in the event that some hiring
opportunities may open up
later. Sometimes suggesting a
specific day for this brief meet-
ing (“would next Wednesday
afternoon be a good time for
you?”) will help to convince a
recruiter to go ahead and sched-
ule a time.

If this approach is unsuccess-
ful, your last two questions to
the recruiter should be, “can I
contact you sometime next
month to find out if your hiring
situation has changed?” and “is
there anyone else that you
know who may be interested in
my qualifications and whom I
should contact?” Most people
are willing to help you in your
job search. Asking for a referral
or possible job lead is perfectly
acceptable and may lead to a
great interviewing opportunity.

Local bar keeps rockin’ into its

By Mark Gordon
Staff‘ Writer

Dom DiSilvio, owner of the

Decade, a bar in Oakland, was
having a rough night on
«Halloween in 1978. He heard
there was a problem: his
kitchen had too many people in
it.

DiSilvio entered the kitchen
and found a “heavy-set, sloven-
ly-looking” guy, who happened
to be the singer Meatloaf.
DiSilvio ordered the guy to
leave, but someone told him
who he was kicking out —
“That's Meatloaf.”

DiSilvio responded, “I don’t
care if he’s fettuccine alfredo,
you have to get out of here.”

That is just one episode of
many that has taken place in
this bar on the corner of
Atwood Street and Sennott
Avenue- The Decade celebrated
its 20th anniversary this past
month. The Police, U2, 10,000
Maniacs and Bruce Springsteen
are just some of the major acts

’ who have performed at the bar.

DiSilvio started out in 1975
with the idea of having 19505
music dominate the stage. The
Brotherhood was the first band
to perform at the Decade, jam-
ming 50’s remixes. However,
DiSilvio said that style of music
was not keeping up with the
college kids who were dominat-
ing the bar scene. In the late
1970s, he began to change the
music to a more updated ver-
sion of rock n’ roll.

“The club is a Rock N’ Roll
saloon. There is no Reggae, no

.Hip—Hop and no Rap played
here,” DiSilvio said. He has
even begun to grow into the
90’s, as some alternative rock
bands _have been playing sets
recently. .

DiSilvio said he likes to have

some unknown alternative
bands play at the Decade
because it gives them a “chance
to become known and maybe
get a record deal."

One hand that started out as
alternative in the early 80’s was
Irish rockers U2. The April 1981
show did not draw the crowds

- or reviews that Bono and the

guys are accustomed to today.
They playedright after the
release of their first album, Boy,
and their song repertoire was

. not too vast. To pass time they

played the single “I Will Follow”
three times. The ‘crowd seemed
to like the opening band,
Carsickness, more then U2,
DiSilvio said.

Carsickness returned to the
Decade to open for another
alternative-turned—mainstream
band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers
in 1984.

That show turned wild when
a friend _of Carsickness front
man Karl Mullen fell onthe
Chili Peppers’ dmm kit. A brawl
broke out; one that the Chili
-Peppers got the best of.

Only a few months before the
Chili Peppers incident, Bruce
Springsteen showed up to play
a few songs. Springsteen and
DiSilvio share a mutual friend,
Joe Giushecky, a musician who

' has played at the Decade with

the band
Houserockers.

Springsteen was in Pittsburgh
for two shows at the Civic Arena
during his Born in the USA tour.
Grushecky decided to treat the
Boss to a hot dog _at The
Original Hot Dog Shop, accord-
ing to DiSilvio. They walked
past the Decade and Bruce
went in to look around. He
leaped on the stage and did a
few songs with Bon Ton Roulet,
the band playing at the time,
DiSilvio said.

Iron City

‘ third Decade with famous acts

One act that was a favorite of
DiSilvio’s was the late guitarist
Stevie Ray Vaughan. DiSilvio
said he met Vaughan at the Jazz
and Heritage Festival in New
Orleans.

The young guitarist was just
getting started and he decided
to play at the Decade for only
$500. The crowd loved him so
much that he came back for a
repeat performance.

Rock N’ Roll bands are not the
only celebrities to have experi-
enced the Decade. According to
DiSilvio, while actors Danny
Devito and Jack Nicholson were
filming “Hoffa” in Oakland last
year, they took a break to share
some tequila and Iron City beer
with DiSilvio and some friends.

DiSilvio, a Pitt graduate, said
he is very proud of the way the

. Dec-ade has developed over the

past 20 years.
He calls the Decade a “show-

case club, a place where people ,

can see national acts at reason-
able prices.”

That is why DiSilvio said that
college students are drawn to
the bar. ’

“College kids love great
music, but they’re short on
money.” I

to pretty uneasy,” Broznick said.

UNOS spokesperson Joel Newman
countered Broznick’s statement by say-
ing that the Casey surgery may have
“raised the issue,” but it was the U.S.
Govemment that asked UNOS to investi-

A gate.

CORE spokesperson Pat Kail said she
believes that UNOS, which had no policy
concerning heart-liver transplants, acted
hastily in developing new guidelines,
without concern for patients, in an effort
to save face.

Under the new policy, passed.17 days
after Casey’s transplant, a patient await-
ing a dual-organ transplant involving a
heart or liver is placed on individual lists
for each organ they need.

Only when they reach the top of either
the heart or liver list are they eligible for
both organs.“The policy restricts health

_care to dual-transplant patients by

assuming that both organs will be avail-
able when they reach the top of one of
the lists,” Kail said.

Newman reluctantly agreed saying,

_ “with any decision, involving dual-organ

transplants, yes, there is an assumption
that [the other organ] will be available”.
If a suitable donor having both organs

is available before the patient reaches '

the top of either list, they are bypassed
for someone needing a single organ,

possibly wasting the other organ if

another suitable recipient isn’t found

I quickly enough.

If a heart-liver candidate does reach
the top of the liver list, for instance, they
would lose that organ for lack of a suit-

able heart if the same donor could not
supply it. Previously, this patient would
have been placed on a separate heart-
liver list. “It’s a Catch 22,” Kail said.

Dr. Andreas Tzakis, a transplant sur-
geon at the Pitt Medical Center and
member of the UNOS committee drafting
the new policy, said he opposed the
new rules,_saying that a multi-organ
transplant should have precedence over
a single-organ transplant.

UNOS maintains separate multi-organ
lists for heart-lung and kidney-pancreas
patients, and so the new policy affects
only heart-liver transplants.

4 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
spokesperson Lisa Rossi said she can’t
understand why UNOS would make
such a distinction._ Newman said since‘
hearts and-livers are considered vital, or
“life-giving” they must be distributed

‘equitably for the process to remain fair. ,

Tzakis said other organs aren’t as vital
because people can live for an unspeci-
fied amount of time without replacing
them by using man-made sustaining
methods, such as kidney dialysis.

UPMC surgeons have questioned the
rationality of the UNOS policy because
the patient must get both organs from a
single donor when they reach the top of
a list or it excludes these patients from
transplantation. ‘ ‘

“In a tag-team wrestling match, when
you have two on two the match is fair.
But if you have two different donors,

‘ then the body is ﬁghting two sources of

rejection without- a partner. You are also
fighting two opponents by waiting on
two-people lists,” Broznick said.

‘‘I couldn’t even imagine [the major
rejection] that would occur if you mixed
organs. Even ‘if they could get them, they
wouldn’t make it. It’s been a year and six
months for me, and I’m still dealing with
rejection,” Rzeczkowski said.

The newly created h_eart—liver policy
raises the fear that continued standard-
ization of policy could be extended to

other ‘organ groups, giving single-organ

transplant patients priority for organs
and cutting off patients like Rzeczkowski
from a chance at life. ‘
There is also fear that the discriminato-
iy policy could be extended to re—trans-
plants. Dr. Peter Ubel, a doctor of inter-
nal medicine at the UPMC, has already
suggested that patients needing a second

transplant should be given a lower prior- *
ity than first time patients. -

If Casey, who is one of only two living
heart-liver transplant patients, had been
forced to wait on the separate lists, he
may have died.

Rzeczkowski, who needed five organs,
would have had to hold out until he was
within a few days of death to top the
liver list, gambling that his donor could
also provide the other four organs.

Rzeczkowski said he is eternally grate-
ful that he beat the odds, which are great
enough already.Before his surgery,
Rzeczkowski suffered from antithrom-
bin-3 deficiency virus. He contracted the
virus when he punctured his foot on
“something” while swimming in a reef in
Venezuela while on vacation in August
of 1989.

The mystery toxin entered his liver and
stopped it from producing blood thin-

ning agents, according to Rzeczkowski.
Because the capillaries feeding the
digestive organs are so small, the organs
were gradually choked off by the clot-
ting of his thickened blood.

Supporters of the new policy say that
since there is no proof that heart-liver
patients are at an earlier risk of death
than those needing hearts or livers, the
policy is fair to both groups.

CORE is opposed to the policy, but
has adopted it. “We generally tend to fol-
low the other centers,”"Kail said.

Although CORE is not legally bound to
follow the UNOS policy, the carrot-and-
stick- policy seems to apply since UNOS

_ has the inﬂuence to cut CORE’s access to

some organs and withhold research
money. .

Rzeczkowski, who is going back to
Slippery Rock University this spring to
pursue his master’s degree in environ-
mental studies, half-jokingly calls himself
“the walking experiment.”

He said he owes his life to his fraterni-
ty Phi Sigma Kappa, Slippery Rock
University and the townspeople of
Slippery Rock who rallied together to
raise additional money to save‘ him.

He said he is etemally grateful for the
doctors of UPMC who refused to give
him up for dead.

He‘ may not

S1.4,434. More than a year’s tuition, room and board
at the University of Pittsburgh. Unfortunately it’s the
cost of treating a child struck down by gunfire, accord-

ing to a survey of ,children’shospitals. This statistic
provides us with another example of how the violence
among our youth affects all of society.

In 1991, 5,556 people under the age of 19 were
killed by gunshots, according to the Phtkzdelphia
In.quz'rer. Over 15 children each day. ‘

With gunshot wounds the fifth leading cause of acci-

‘dental death for those under 14, it’s time to seriously

address the issue of guns‘ and youth. Although
Congress recently passed the Brady Bill which will
require "a five-day waiting period for those purchasing

firearms, it won’t prevent minors from buying the guns »

on the streets any day, any time they want them.

“Not only do we see kids coming in with gunshot
wounds, but we see a large number of kids coming in
with guns,” Lawrence Mc Andrews, president of the
National Association of Children’s Hospitals and
Related Institutions said in the Inqmrer.

As many in the nation talk about the issue, this
weekend leaders of eight Western Pennsylvania chap-

ters of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People took action to try and do something
' about it. Saturday, members of the NAACP searched

for answers to end youth violence at a conference
held in Wilkinsburg. Focusing on solutions, the open
forum gave members of the community the opportuni-

ty tovoice their opinions and concerns to each other,

accordingto the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. Speakers
challenged community members to serve as role mod-
els and “adopt” a youth. "
It’s time for the community to stop placing blame
and start such a grass roots effort to help curb the vio-
lence. Instead of looking‘ at the problem, as society has
been, as a general one of youth and violence, an indi-

A vidual approach as proposed at the forum could be

part of the solution the community is looking for. ‘

The problem isn’t only children with guns, but with
the disorganization of the adults trying to address the
growing violence. .

“The kids have gridlock in the streets and the adults
have gridlock when they’re trying to make progress,”
Anthony Anderson of Homewood said in the Post-
Gazette. Efforts such as those taken by the NAACP,
open forums and community involvement, are ways
around such gridlock.

The Post-Gazette reported that the NAACP will be

devising a plan of action and revealing it to the com-

munity in about two weeks. We hope more members
of the Pitt community will join in this process and
offer to serve as role models for youth, as speakers at
'.tl1e forum encouraged. It is only through united com—2
munity effort that any changes will be made.

Legalized abortions still dangerous

In their haste to foist a
national policy of abortion on
demand onto the American
society, abortion advocates rely
on horror stories about the ter-
rible days when women suf-
fered because abortion was
prohibited under law. Now that
abortion is legal, women are
liberated, or so the pro—abor—
tion forces claim.

How many times have we
heard the deceptive buzz
phrase, “keep abortion safe and
legal”?

Contrary to what those who
use these scare tactics to justify
abortion tell you, the “bad old
daysf’ Weren’t quite as bad as
they claim. And the present
state of abortion on demand
has brought about anything but
the liberation of women.

It is not true that tens of
thousands of women died
annually from illegal abortions.
Nor is it true that these abor-
tions were performed by back-
alley butchers.

In fact, Dr. Bernard
Nathanson, co-founder of the
National Abortion Rights Action
League, admitted that NARAL
lied about the number of
women who died from illegal
abortions. In his book,
Ahortmg America, Nathanson
writes, “we spoke of ‘5,000 to
10,000 deaths a year’. I confess
that I knew the "figures were
totally false . But, in the
‘morality’ of our revolution, it
was a useful figure, widely
accepted, so why go out of our
way to correct it with honest
statistics? The overriding con-
cern was to get the laws elimi-

nated, and anything within rea-_

son that had to be done was
permissible.”

For decades prior to Roe vs
Wade, the overwhelming
majority of illegal abortions
were not done in back alleys,
but in the back offices of
licensed physicians.

In 1960, abortion promoter
Planned Parenthood stated that
“.90. r2<%.1i¢snr-0fa11 .i.1_1.eg.a.1.8J2<.>1:-

A

tions‘ are presently done by
physicians.”

One must go back to the pre-
penicillin era to find a year
where more than 1,000 women
died from abortion.

The 1940’s and the advent of

penicillin saw a great drop in
deaths from abortion. In 1972,
the year before Roe vs Wade,
only 59 women died. Then
abortion became legal, and
women continue to ‘die.
Legalized abortion has led to

Jeff
Paladina

15 times more women having _

abortions.

This means that even if legal
abortion was 15 times safer
than illegal abortion, the num-
ber of women dying remains
the same. In the Amer-icm'z
journal of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Dr. ’ Dennis
Cavanaugh wrote that ever
since the time when abortion
was made legal, “There has
been no majorimpact on the
number of women dying in the
U.S.  after all, it really makes
no difference whether a
woman dies from legal or ille-
gal abortion; she is dead none
the less. I find no comfort in
the fact that legal abortion is
now the leading cause of abor-
tion-related maternal deaths in
the US.”

Women who do survive
abortions often suffer horrible
physical and emotional compli-
cations.

The cervical muscle is often
damaged -in an abortion
because the cervix is forcefully
dilated. This means that any
future pregnancies ‘have a
greater chance of resulting in
miscarriage or premature deliv-
ery.

Damage tothe uterine wall is
another cjo,n_c.e_r_n.. gPe_rforatior_1 , of

the uterus, infection,» hemor-
rhage and blood clots are only
a few of the. complications of

abortion. Due to the rapid»

growth of breast tissue in early
pregnancy, any premature ces-
sation of pregnancy creates an
unnatural condition in the
mother’s breasts.

Consequently, women who
have first—trimester abortions
have twice the risk of contract-
ing breast cancer as those who
give birth.

The Brittsh Mec'lt'cal_]oz1mctl,
after reviewing’ psychological
research on abortion, conclud-

-ed that “almost all those [who]

terminated [their pregnancies]

. feel guilt and depression” for at

least a brief period.

Negative effects caused by
abortions are also evident by
the existence and swelling
ranks of the organization

Women Exploited By Abortion.-

There are WEBA chapters in
every state for women suffering
the psychological damage of

Abortion, whether legal or.
illegal, has horrible conse-
quences for both the mother
and her child.

David Reardon in Aborted

sums up the differences
between legal and illegal abor-
tion. “Unfortunately, every hor-
ror that~is true of illegal abor-
tion is also true about legalized
abortion. Many veterans of ille-

' gal abortion, however, do not

realize this. Instead, they cling
to the belief that all the pain
and problems that they suf-
fered could have been avoided
if only abortion had been legal.
They imaginedthat if their
abortions had been legal, their
lives would somehow be better
today. Instead of recognizing
that litl is the very nature of
abortion itself which caused
their problems, they blame
their suffering on the illegality
of abortion at thetime.”

By Brett Fondrk -
Staff Writer .

On a night when Pitt scored
112 points, the only things that
seemed to be able to stop the
high-octane Panther attack were
two power outages in the first
half.

While technical difficulties
caused the scoreboard to stop
the game atithe 16:49 and 11:30
marks of the first half, Pitt tied a
school record for most field
goals (48) as they pounded the '
Youngstown State Penguins
112-66 before 13,124 people at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“I would liketo thank [Pitt
head] coach [Paul] Evans
because he could have beat us _
by 200,” said YSU Coach Dan
Peters.

“How many dunks didwe see
out there tonight, 25?”

Pitt had 14 dunks, with seven
center Eric

was a perfect 10-10 from the
field. .

“Eric’s offense has.improved,”
Paul Evans said. “He’s got some
moves, he’s got the turn-around
jumper and he’s more confi-
dent. He’s making his moves a
lot quicker.”

Mobley felt that the return of
point guard Jerry McCullough,
who had been suffering from
strep throat, was a big part of
the Panther win.

He was seven—of—seven from
the floor, including two—of—two
from three—point land, making
16 points.

Pitt led 62-26 at the half and
had shot a sizzling 68.3 percent
from the field. The Panthers
didn’t seem to lose a step in the
second half as the reserves, led
by Garrick Thomas’ who accu-
mulated 15 points in only nine
minutes, continued to. light up
the scoreboard. Pitt ended the
game shooting an impressive
64.9 percent from the field. _

“They may be good shooters,
but you can atleast make an
effort to get your hands up,”
Peters said.-‘

“You can’t feel sorry for your-
self out there.”

One place that Pitt did not
shoot well was from the line,
where they shot a paltry six-of-
15 (40%) from the charity stripe
— a number that must improve
before Big East play begins.

Serzior Stajff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
team has never lost to
Duquesne, but trailed the Lady
Dukes 31-26 at the half in
Saturday’s opener at Fitzgerald
Field House.

The Lady Panthers, who used
all 14 players on their roster,

’ opened the second half with a

20-1 run on the way to a 66-50
victory.

“I personally feel as if we
wore them out,” Pitt Head
Coach Kirk Bruce said.

“—We’ve got the players, so
we’re going to use them.-I

thought we were in a little bet-
ter shape than they were. We're
down five, then all of a sudden,
within less than three minutes,
we are up three.”

Four Duquesne players
logged over 30 minutes and
guard Michelle Bouldin played
for 28. Only junior guard Jenine

‘Joyce and senior forward Jonna

I-Iuemrich were on the court
over 30 minutes for Pitt. ’

The Lady Dukes led by as
much as nine points in the first
half. Pitt not only struggled to
find its shots, but it also sting-
gled on the free-throw line, hit—
ting only one of six freebies in
the first half, five of 11 for the
game. _

“Our free-throw shooting was
terrible,” Bruce said. “We’re
much better than that.”

Sophomore guard Tracey

_Paul provided the offense for

Duquesne with four three-
pointers in the half. Scoring 20
points in the game. Paul led all
other scorers with six three-
pointers and two free-throws
(after being fouled on a three-
point attempt).

“All week we were saying,
‘Let’s kill them,”’ Huemrich said.
“We came out and tried too‘
hard. Things just don’t work
when you get like that. The sec-
ond half we relaxed, played our
game and things started work-
ing.”

One thing that was not work-
ing was the fast break, which
was supposed to be such a big
part of the Panthers’ game this
season. The break did not
develop in large part due to the
team’s defense.

“I think we knew we were
doing a poor job defensively in
the first half,” Huemrich said.
“We were a step slow for things.
We let them get too many
rebounds.

' “What we said in the second
half was, ‘Let’s play defense in
the second half and the offense
will come?”

Pitt stifled the Duquesne
attack in the second stanza, giv-
ing up only 19 points. The
Dukes hit only four of 17 shots
from the floor (25.5 percent) in
the half. Bruce pointed to the
importance of shutting down
Duquesne forward Kris
Sebastian.

Dunk-afied Panther line-up rocks Field
House rims in electric opening night win

Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers put on a
dunking clinic Saturday night at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Even people who are most
lacking in basketball knowledge
should have learned the proper
way to breakdown a defense
and jam a basketball for two
points.

First, start with a point guard
—— Jerry McCullough for exam-
ple — pushing the ball quickly
up the floor and setting up the
offense.

Throw in an overpowering
Center in the paint — Eric
Mobley will fit this bill — who
knows what to do with the ball
once he gets the ball under the
basket. '

Have the point guard pass the
ball to the big guy in the middle
and bam, a slam dunk.

Pretty simple, isn’t it?

That’s what it looked like last
Saturday night as the Penguins
of Youngstown State University
were unable to stop the monster
jams of the Pitt Panthers.

“How many dunks did we see
out there tonight, 25?” YSU
Head Coach Dan Peters asked.

On the way to the Panthers
112—66,victory over YSU, the
Panthers recorded 15 explosive
jams. °

At times it seemed like the
Harlem Globetrotters dominat-
ing the Washington Generals on
the basketball court.

Saturday night the Panthers

' completely ran the Penguins of

YSU off the Field House floor. .

YSU was unable to deal with
the Panthers’ up—tempo style of
game.

Most shots for the Panthers
were taken with 25 seconds still
remaining on the 35—second
shot clock. A

Without any pressure from
YSU, McCullough was able to
quickly move the ball up the
COl11"[ and work the ball into the
paint area for some classic jams.

The main dunker for the
Panthers was six—foot-11-inch,
250—pound center Eric Mobley
who had seven dunks on way
to his game high 20 points,
despite only playing 20 minutes
total in the game. ‘

Mobley credits his big
evening to the return of point
guard Jerry McCullough to the
starting line-up.

“It felt good to have Jerry
back out there,” Mobley said.
“'He’s one of the players who
really knows me, as a person
and a basketball player. It felt
good knowing he would be out
there trying to get me the ball.”

Mobley physically dominated
the much smaller YSU forwards
who tried to defend him.

Two YSU forwards, Brian

Thaxton and Derick Simmons,

with their six—foot-five—inch,
205—pound frames couldn’t deal
with Mobley’s power game.

“He’s got the confidence and
he’s making his moves a lot
quicker,” said Pitt Head Coach
Paul Evans.

Mobley wasn’t the only

can’t post—up with them with
who we have.”

The most exciting of the
Panther’s 15 jams was turned in
by guard Garrick Thomas.

With just seconds remaining
in the game, Thomas took a
perfect alley-oop pass from
Andre Alridge and slammed a

S rim-rocking jam into the hole.

All night the Panthers out—‘.
muscled, out—hustled, and out-
ran the Penguins of YSU com-
p1etely"off the court.

The Panthers’ schedule gets
considerably tougher in the
next couple of weeks. Don’t
expect the Panthers to feast on
teams the way they did on the
young YSU team. Every night
won’t be as easy as last Saturday

But if Pitt can come out every
night with the same intensity as
they did Saturday night, they
will finish better in the Big East
Conference than many of the
college hoops previews have
predicted for them.

“We wanted to set the tone in
the first five minutes,” Orlando
Antigua said.

“We wanted to makeisure
they didn’t get enough confi-
dence to be standing around at
the end.”

If Pitt can put on slam-fests
the way they did against YSU,
not many teams will be standing
around at the end of games
against the Panthers.

The Panthers set the
tone early as they jumped
out to a 53-12 lead in the
first 10 minutes. Pitt led
by 46 at the half and hit a
high mark of 52 at the
8:43 mark of the second
half on a fast break layup
by Thomas.

.All 15 Panthers saw
playing time as Evans
cleared his bench. Twelve
of those 15 scored, with
seven attaining double
digits.

YSU was led A by
reserves Damon Johnson
and Dennis Ryan who
had 12 and 10 points
respectively.

fact that we held Kris Sebastian

. to eight points,” Bruce said.

"That girl can score. That was a
combination of jenine, Carol
[Morton], JC [Colabresel and
Katina [Miles]  all of those
players were on her. At the end
of the game, she was probably
worn out a little bit because we
had different people on her.
That was the whole idea.”

As the defense clamped
down, Pitt started scoring.
Huemrich got on track and the
Panthers started to run.

Huemrich scored 12 points
and grabbed eight rebounds in
the second half. «

“Jonna’s a great player‘.

‘ You've got to stop her when
you can. They could only stop

her for a half,” Bruce said. “In
the second half, she worked
harder to get the ball. We got
her the ball where she could do
something with it.”

In addition to a,_defense that
forced 50 turnovers, P.itt’s
improved rebounding let the
Panthers get out on the fast

. break. A bigger Duquesne

squad held a 22-16 rebounding
advantage at the half, but
Bruce's team wiped the boards
clean to the tune of a 20-6 edge
in the second half.

“I attribute [the running game]
to getting more loose balls,
more opportunities to shoot the
ball,” Bruce said. “We had 19
more attempts than they did.
When you get more attempts
than the other team did and you
are making 47-48 percent of
your shots, you are going to
win.” H

' [from

All those factors combined to
allow the Panthers to roll off
that 20-1 run, capped offby two
jumpers by rookie center/for-
ward Missy Thompson.

Paul ended the run with her
fifth trey at the 11:37 mark, but
another Pitt rookie, point guard
Jojo Guzman, answered with
her first career three—pointer.

“Look at the way Jojo
played,” Bruce said. “[Starting
point guard] Carol Morton got in

-foul trouble. We put Jojo in,

and she goes four for eight
the field] with
turnovers, two assists and a
steal. jojo is productive.”

Pitt also got a solid game in
the middle from center Carolyn
Miller, who had 12 points, six
rebounds and one blocked shot.

“Carolyn. Miller is very
encouraging,” Bruce said.

“She caught the ball and
scored. They got her the ball
where all she had to do was
catch the ball andscore. That’s
what you want to do with any
of your post players. You don’t
want to have them do too
much.” . '

The six-foot—three-inch senior
also stayed out of the foul trou-
ble that has plagued her in the
past. ’

“She had only had one per-
sonal foul,” Bruce said. “[When
she gets in foul trouble], she
tries to challenge every shot
inside. She didn’t challenge a
whole lot of shots today. She set
some hard screens. That’s what
we need out of her.”

Pitt extended its lead to as _

many as 18, and Duquesne was
never able to pull closer than 13

Bruce said it was too early to
tell what the regular rotation of
players will be yet, but a lot of
people will play.

“We got positive play out of '

said. 2
'“We’re trying to give them

jaynes has been criticized for not extending Evans’ con-
tract, which would show some stability at Pitt’s helm, even if
the extension would be a token move.

Other big mouths criticized Pitt from the opposite end of
the scale — for having Evans here at all — while immediately
reminiscing about past blunders (lack of tournament success)
tl1at=-happened to Pitt’s basketball team. *

Oval Jaynes is not the inexperienced and bumbling athletic
director that Ed.Bozik was.

Jaynes knows better than to sign coaches to big contracts
only to have to fire them two years later. Pitt would have to
pay the rest of their contract off — all the while paying the
replacement coach.

Jaynes” is also honest enough to tell a future recruit that
there is no guarantee that Evans will be here in the years to
come. '

What if Evans would get a contract elsewhere before Pitt
signed him?

In this case, if Jaynes told a recruit right now that Evans
would definitely be here next year, then he would have a
reputation of lying.

Perhaps Evans’ contract talks (if there will be any) will be
directly proportionate to his performance this year.

But right now that is not a concern. «

Pitt basketball fans should just try to support the team and
its coaches during this year’s season and worry about what
happens after the season later. _

Also, there is no way one could definitely say that the pro-
granrwould have been better- under someone else than
Evans.

It could have been worse for Pitt basketball, perhaps much
worse. .

So when second guessing the program and its head coach
comes to mind, remember, we do not know if someone
other than Paul “George Bailey” Evans would have been any
better.

Continued from page 7

And if you think things would have been better for Pitt’s —

basketball program under someone else, also remember how
much worse Potterstown was without George Bailey than
Bedford Falls was with him.
