Lecture stresses activism, jobs in Deaf community

Meagan Hart
Staff Writer

Kim Mathos said the ability to speak an-
other language andube aware of another
culture can be useful in almost any ﬁeld
of study. I _

Mathos, a doctor who specializes in

child and adolescent psychiatry, was not

talking speciﬁcally about different spo-
ken languages, but rather American Sign
Language, the predominant sign language
of Deaf communities in the United States
and other countries around the world.

“People will open up to you in entirely
different ways,” Mathos said.

Mathos, along with four other panel-
ists who work with the Deaf and Hard

of Hearing communities, spoke at an

event focusing on activism and job op-
portunity within the Deaf community
at 6:30 p.m. in the William Pitt Union’s

.  Kitchen    

gives local
movie makers
a place to share

Andrew Fishman
Staﬁ” Writer

All ﬁlmmakers dream of the opportunity
to get their names out there -— a chance
for their hard work and inventiveness to
be shared with complete strangers.

The Pittsburgh Filmmakers Film Kitch-.
en, a monthly program that gives local ﬁlm-
makers a chance to show their short ﬁlms
on the big screen, provides them with that

opportunity. - - 1* '

“The Film Kitchen is avenue for re-
gional ﬁlm and video artists to have their
movies play in front of an audience,” said
Matthew Day, the host and curator of the
Film Kitchen for the last six years. ‘.‘You can

make movies and put them on the Internet, V

but it is a whole different experience when

, you have your movie play in front of a live

audience.” ‘

For $5, viewers receive a ticket for a
night’s worth of screenings, usually three
short ﬁlms by three different local ﬁlmmak-
ers, as well as unlimited pizza and — if of
age — beer. After an hour—long reception,
the -"ﬁlmmakers get a chance to show their

work to a live audience — often for the A

ﬁrst time. _
“That really is my favorite part about

Kurtzman Room Monday ‘night. About

80 students attended the presentation,
which was sponsored by Pitt’s American

’ Sign Language Club and Pitt’s Disability
' Resources and Services.

A translator stood at the front of the
room and signed to members of the Deaf
community in attendance while each
panel member-spoke about their work.

“One panel member talked about inﬂu-
ences from her personal life that led her to
work with people in the Deaf community.

Sharon Hughes-Morris, director for
the Assistant Device Center and Outreach
Services of the Center for Hearing and
Deaf Services Inc., talked about how she
grew up with a cousin who was deaf.

However, her family did notuse Amer-
ican Sign Language (ASL) around her
cousin. Her cousin’s struggle to commu-
nicate with her family helped to inspire
Hughes—Morris in her work for the Deaf
community. ‘ -

“It can be hard for deaf people in the
African—American community to incor-
porate into society, because they often
have unique signs,” Hughes-Morris said.
“I want to create better communication
and clarity.”

The Center for_Hearing and Deaf Ser-
vices provides an affordable program that
addresses and assists problems that those
who are deaf or hardiof hearing may face.

Alexis McCathern, a freshman neuro-
science major at Pitt, attended the event
as part of a requirement for the American
Sign Language Certiﬁcate offered by the
University,and said she got a lot out of
the presentation.

“I also wanted to learn how someone
who can hear can be a part of the Deaf
community,” McCa'thern said. “It was very
informative.” '

an ample opportunity to do so by the time of publication. The Pitt News regrets this error.

According to Mathos, it is easy to be
a part of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing '
communities.

“[The Deaf community].-appreciates
any attempt to communicate,” Mathos-
said. “There are many programs and ways
to learn sign language. It’s also important
that their basic needs are met.”- t

After the panelists ﬁnished speaking,
one audience member asked about the
effects that new technology has had on
the Deaf community.

Tara Nikou, coordinatorof the Choic-
es for Children program at the Western
Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, said she
supports technological advances.

“Technology is crucial for the future of
the Deaf community, ’ Nikou said.

Scott Doughérty, a‘ Pennsylvania-

’ certiﬁed teacher of the deaf and adjunct

professor of ASL and Instructional Tech-
nology at Duquesne, offered a counter-
argument. .

“Technology is both a blessing and a
curse,” Dougherty said. “There are many
beneﬁts, but there is-a drawback: The
Deaf community doesn’t get together in
person anymore because they can just
use Skypeor other technological ways of
communication.” ‘

Alexandria Grant, president of the.
American Sign Language Club at Pitt,.
hosted theevent using‘a_ mix of sign lan-
guageand spoken English.

“This is a good opportunity for stu-
dents to get internships in the ﬁeld,”
Grant said. “It’s also an opportunity for
interested Students to ask questions about
their best options.” ‘ .

Anne Baxendell, interpreter manager
at Sorenson Communications, a company
that uses technology to empower Deaf
people,‘ gave a ﬁnal pieceof advice to
those who may want to work with the
Deaf community. '

“Follow your passion,” she said. “I

work with what I love, so I win.” I

Immigration an ' inherent, economical
I component to American society

Matt Barnes
C0Zumnz'st

By simply reﬂecting upon this coun-

try’s history, it is clear that it is one
of — and it always has
been.’ .

In t,he.mid-19th century,’ the

Irish came to America to ﬂee a po— -

tato famine, while Germans sought
to escape the failed revolution of
1848. Later, during the American
industrial period of the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, when smoke
ﬁlled the skyand hope ﬁlled the air,
Southern and Eastern Europeans
arrived on America’s shore looking

' up to a new colossus, a statue of1ib-

erty welcoming them, “[the] tired,
[the] poor, [the] huddled masses

yearningto breathe free,” to a prom- .

ised land of opportun'ity. In modern
times, waves of immigration from
Latin America, Asia and Africa have

, dawned a new age of what it means

to be an American during a time of
unprecedented globalization.

In order to discuss the depth of
American identity, we must look
back not only on our triumphs but
also on our downfalls.

The American experience has

‘not always been easy. Hostility

toward newly arrived people has
been present throughout most of

» American history Many ofthe earli-

est people brought to this country
were done so against their ‘wills,’
under the atrocious conditions of
slave importation. Whether during
slavery or segregation, the history
of the African-American experi-
ence has been ﬁlled with extreme
adversity. _

Prejudice has aifected many
groups from various regions of the
world. Chinese labor immigration
was prohibited in the now-infamous
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. It
is often forgotten that at one time,
many considered Irish-Americans
to be subhuman. The tired and poor

Southern and Eastern European im~ _

migrants  for opportunity

were often met with hatred and

opposition from strong nativists.
The earliest residents of our

continent, appropriately referred .
to as Native Americans, were not 3

even granted citizenship until the
1924 Indian Citizen Act.

Discrimination against foreign-

ers has also extended to religious
afliliation. The Ku Klux Klan, which
is most known for its persecution of
African-Americans, also considered
Jews and Catholics as enemies and
targets. In fact, by the mid-1920s,
the KKK claimed to have 4 million
members, more than the entire
Americanjewish population.

There are too many prejudices
that have plagued society to possibly
touch upon them all.

Returning to the present, it
should be clear that historical
trendsof opposition to those newly
arrived is nothing new.

Aside from pure historical
trends, present economic beneﬁts
must be factored into modern dia-
logue. The argument that immi-
grants and those born elsewhere
hurt the economy does not hold up
against true economic scrutiny. In
reality, immigrants contribute more
to the national economy than they
beneﬁt from it. It is estimated that
immigration reform would create
121,000 new jobs "over the next
decade. Immigrants contribute
$10 billion annually to the nation’s
economic growth.

If reform were to pass, the Con-
gressional Budget Ofﬁce has esti—
mated that real GDPwill increase by

, 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent

in 2033. Additionally, the CBO has
concluded that passing immigra-
tion reform will reduce the federal
budget deﬁcit by nearly $850 billion
over the next 20 years. In Pem1syl—

C Vania alone, reform could increase

Gross State Product by more than

$14.8 billion over the next 10 .

years. State residents would also
see a cumulative increase of $9.3
billion in earnings. Immigrants,
who contributeanet positivetothe
economy, have also contributed to
the solvency of the nation’s social
security trust ﬁmd.

These statistics only come about
by the tangible efforts of legal im-
migrants. Immigrants are 30 per-
cent more likely to start their own
businesses than non—immigrants
and make up 18 percent of small
business owners nationally. These

. businesses in turn create jobs, em-

ploying a:n estimated 4.7 million
individuals in 2007 alone. Accord-
ing to the most recent calculations,
small businesses owned by immi-
grants generate more than $776
billion'annually. ..
Immigrants are not the only
group of people beneﬁting from
their efl'orts.Accordingtoastudy by
the University of California—Davis,
between 1990 and 2004, increased
immigration was correlated with

A increased earnings of Americans by

0.7 percent and is expected to con-
tribute to an increase of 1.8 percent
inthe long term. I 3
Immigration is also essential to
the success of local businesses. In
an age dominated by large corpora-
tions, small enterprise is deserving
ofhelp and assistance; immigrants
provide exactly that. The Immigra-
tion Policy Center estimates that the
purchasing power of Latinos and
Asians, many of whom are immi-
grants, will reach $1.5 trillion and
$775 billion, respectively, by 2015.
Many of these immigrants use their
increased buying power to purchase
local goods, therefore increasing
demand for their respective local
economies. ~
Finally, because of increased tax
revenue brought in by newly natu-
ralized immigrants, reform would

cut the federal deﬁcit by $2.2 billion over

the next 10 years. With this, national GDP
is expected to rise from o.8,percent to 1.8
percent by 2016. To a nation more than $17
trillion in debt (with consistentfederal deﬁcits
adding ontothis number each year), every
effective measure taken to increase national
ﬁscal and ﬁnancial solvency merits serious
consideration.

The decisions made today will seem natu-
ral in the future. But in reality, progress and

a bright future only come about when action
— often unpopular action — is taken today.
As historian David McCullough stated in his
2003 lecture “The Course of Human Events”:
“Washington,Jeffersori,]ohn Adams and their
contemporaries didn’t walk about saying,

A ‘Isn’t this fascinating living in the past! Aren’t

we picturesque in our ﬁinny clothes!’ They
lived in the present. The difference is it was
their present, not ours. They were caught up

in the living moment exactly as we are, and

with.‘ no more certainty of how things would

_turn out-than we have.”

As a nation, we cannot become so com-
fortable with past achievementsthat cur-

rent and future progress is stalled. It is thus
our responsibility to study the past not so
that we may live‘ in it, but rather that we may
improve upon it.

Ultimately, what it means to be an Ameri-
can is not merely where one or one’s parents
were born, not merely. which language one
originally spoke, not merely which religion
one practices. Rather, true national identity

lies in one’s cornmitment to protect freedom} 1 V
forall—— not onlyfor one, not only for some. 

This nation does not belong to "one particular

. 1 race, religion orethnicity. Rather, this "nation
-‘ is one that has progressed over generations to
-_ form a more perfect union through tolerance

and acceptance, through progress and protec-
tionfor those seeking to realize a peaceful,

‘free and worthwhile existence.

This mindset has forced us all to expand
our horizons and to overcome the prejudices

‘ of our ancestors. It has expanded this nation
from’ a mere experiment of democracy to a .

thrivingsociety’ built upon the foundations
of freedom and _oppor_tunity. It has truly
‘made this country exceptional, and it is our

‘responsibility, as advocates of freedom and
descendants of immigrants, to never forget ~
‘ that America is aland of opportunity not for
_ some, but for all. fl 5 ' - -

“RoboCop”

Directed by: Jose Padilha
Starring: Joel Kinnaman,
Gary Oldman, Michael
Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson
Grade: C-

In order to truly understand why

2o14’s “RoboCop” is so awful, you

a must ﬁrst realize why the original

1987 version is still revered as a
cult classic.

. In the summer of 1987, amid
rising crime rates and at a time
when the deregulating mecha-
nisms of Reaganomicshad taken
full effect on the American con-

sciousness, “RoboCop” made its

debut. On the surface, it was a
gory, eheesy and seemingly mind—
less sci—ﬁ ﬂick about a futuristic
tin man who ﬁghts an evil cor-
poration —— with plenty of face-
melting chemicals and explosions
along the way.

Give “RoboCop” a second
glance, however, and the ﬁlm
gives you a more critical take on
the brazen consumerism of the
era in which it was made. The
ﬁlm is littered with jabs at our
collective obsession with acquir-
ing the newest shiny toy and the
way it affects our own humanity.
Advertisements for purchasing
new, high—performance hearts or
nuclear—annihilation board games
play throughout the ﬁlm.

c

In one particularly amusing

scene, a man holding the mayor '

at gunpoint demands a new car
“with leather reclining seats and
sh*tty gas mileage.”

In the 27 years since the origi-
nal “RoboCo'p” ﬁrs_t made waves,
anxieties over the role of tech-

nology in our lives have become

exponentially more widespread
and complicated.

From the NSA’s PRISM pro-
gram to the use of predator
drones or even questions about

whether or not our thousands of.

friends on Facebook are making
us lonelier, it seems that nearly
every facet of our lives has been
bathed in the pale light of a glow-
ing screen — making “Robo-
Cop’s” blood-soaked critique of

intelligent sci-fi film. MCT Campus

capitalism’s dehumanizing nature

seem naive by comparison. ‘

But if the original “Robocop”
comes off as a dated‘ critique of
modern i1ls,ithe cult c1assic’s
hackneyed update is something
worse: a moronic action ﬂick
that uses the modern issue of
drone warfare to masquerade as

relevant. The result is a glossy, .

run—of-the—mill, shoot-em—up
science—ﬁction ﬁlm that goes out
of its way to insult the intelligence
of anyone who came to the theater
expecting the social satire of the
original. Director Jose Padilha
would much rather have you sit
in awe of all his special effects and
gadgets, whispering “I’d buy that
for a dollar” to the person sitting

‘beside you.

Like the original, this reboot
of “RoboCop” opens with a news
broadcast from the future (the
year is 2028) — albeit with a
modern, star-powered twist.
Standing in front of a flashy
graphic, “Novak Element” host
Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson)
emulates Bill O’Reilly and a host

of other news pundits as he goes .

on a diatribe against America’s
reluctance to use drones to pro—
tect its own streets, even though
they are being used to crack down
on violence in every other nation
on the globe.

Nox Boys

Grade: B-

Sounds like: A promising bond
that has cz little growing up to do‘

In“ its debut self-titled album, local band ‘

Nox Boys provides a lot of what_you
-would expect from a teenage garage
band, along with some pleasant sur-
prises.

The most pleasant surp'rise on the
album is the slide guitar work of veteran

musician Bob Powers, a staple in the *

Pittsburgh music scene. Powers was a
frequent sideman for Pittsburgh guitar
hero Warren King, so he sure knows
the ropes on the local circuit. When he
met current Nox Boys singer Zack Keim
at an open mic night in Blawnox, Pa.,

the two formed a duo. Their Blawnoxl

roots later formed_ the inspiration for

COLUMN

Jesse Eisenberg-a questionable selection as the  Lex Luthor a

Jack Trainor
Staﬁ” 'W'rz'z‘.er

If you thought Zack Snyder and company
would have learned from last year’s disap-
pointing Superman reboot “Man of Steel,”
think agaimjesse Eisenberg —— best known
for playing Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social
Network” — has been cast as notorious
supervillain Lex Luthor in the sequel.

For those unversed in their Superman
literature, Lex Luthor is Superman’s archri—
val, as ‘well as a ﬁgure of power and intellect
who even becomes president of the United
States in the series.

Eisenberg joins a well—known club of ac— »

tors who have portrayed the villain, whose
most notable members include Kevin
Spacey in the equally awful “Superman
Returns” (2006), Gene Hackman in “Su—
perman” (1978) and Michael Rosenbaum in
the popular television series “Smallville.”

Although I can — surprisingly ~— pic-

the band name. With the addition of
Powers"nephew Sam Berman on drums
and Zach Stadtlander on bass, the quar-
tet known as Nox Boys was forméd._ ‘

Powers is the life of the group and '

brings the most exciting ingredient
to the table with his nifty slide guitar
licks,but the band is talented up front:
Keim has an impressive voice witha nice
range, and is at his best on “Desperate
Girl” and “Mr. No One.”
~ The level of musicianship is quite
‘high, especially forthreeshigh school
kids from Fox Chapel, Pa. That isn’t to
say, however, that there aren’t plenty
of garage band moments on the album.
Minutes and even whole songs ofplay-
ing beyond their years are mixed in-with
predictable’ sections of immature lyrics,
loud crash cymbals and power chords-
Powers is always-there to cover up when
the boys,aren’t at their best, though, so
some of the amateur songwriting can
be overlooked. S V i S I
“Desperate Girl,” though it provides
a good sampling of Keim’s strong voice

- and Powers’ groovy guitar work, is a

ture him without any hair, Eisenberg isn’t
half as intimidating as any of his prede-
cessors. Nor does he ﬁt the bill physically.
IMDb.com has him listed at 5—foot-7, where-
as Henry Cavill, who will reprise his role as

"Superman, is 6—foot-1. Did anyone mention

to Eisenberg yet that Luthor is bald?
Apart from his portrayal as Facebook
creator Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social
Networ ” (which got him an Academy
Award nomination for best actor), his re-
sumé is composed of mostly typecast roles
as an awkward, curly—haired dude. These
include angsty teen-dramedy “Adven-
tureland” (2009), “Zombieland” (2009)

and the woefully unfunny “30 Minutes or ‘ A

Less” (2011). His thin frame and nerdy,
laid—back style would be better suited to
play craftier roles, suchas the far more
innocuous Riddler, than one of DC’s pow-
erhouse evil villains. ’
So far there doesn’t seem to be much to
look forward to in this movie, apart from
seeing" Superman ﬁght Batman. Tlfat’ll be

questionable choice to lead off the al-
bum. The post-high-school listener who

‘is looking for something more than a
young -Ramones knock—off may be a 3
bit disappointed -— which would be-

a shame, because the album has much
more to offer. It feels like a mid—re-cord
ﬁller track, something a listener might

or “Susie Lee.” V

tracks on the album, seco‘nd._only to

“Susie Lee.’-’ The track was inspired by’
former band member David Weaver, the 4 ‘ 
original bass player for Nox_Boys, who
left to go to military school. The song V

is a true head—banger, with an electrify-
ing main riff provided by Powers and
a funny story told by Keim about a boy
who wassent back to military school.

[ﬁlmmakers], it’s the ﬁrst time they’ve ever
shown something to people in an audience.
That excitement, it’s really awesome. It

For the past 16 years, Film Kitchen has ,

been providingavenue for local, independent
ﬁlmmakers to display their work. It ﬁts into

‘ the overall mission of Pittsburgh Filmmakers,

an organization and school in Pittsburgh that

throughout'the year at a number of diﬂerent ; 1

theaters around the city-, as well as classes in
ﬁlm production. _ . ‘

‘The purpose of the Pittsburgh Filmmak-
ers is to act as an establishment where you
can go and not only learn about ﬁlm and
the production of ﬁlm, but enjoy ﬁlm, and

just be immersed inthe entire artform that
l is ﬁlm,” said Stephen Kraus, a sophomore

information science and business major -at

' Pitt who works for Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

“They really try and bolster the image of 10-

excellent job of that through many outlets.”

Besides the‘ Film Kitchen, whichis held V l " 

the second Tuesday of every month except
August, some other outlets include aweekly

shows a classic ﬁlm on Sunday night every

week, as well as the annual Three Rivers  .

Festival. In addition, classes in ﬁlm produc-
tion are offered throughout the year. .

The Film Kitchen focuses on providing
independent ﬁlmmakers a chance to show
their work, as well as entertaining those with
a love for ﬁlm. The Film Kitchen attracts a

-wide variety of viewers, from friends and

family of the ﬁlmmakers, themselves, to ﬁlm

Pittsburgh local Bob Sweetland has been
coming to the Film Kitchen for the last 10

“I really like the environment. You run

about movies. __It’s really a community in that
sense.” .

Day added that those who attend ﬁlm-

i_ makers events also stand to gain a strong

sense of the current state of ﬁlm in Pitts-

burgh.

“[Viewers who are there for the love of
ﬁlm] are the people who get the most out of
Film Kitchen,” Day said. “When you come
for several months in a row, you start to get a
bigger ideaabout what the ﬁlmmaking com-

munity in Pittsburgh is doing, the different.

kinds of ideas they have, and different proj-
ects being made.’’ .
Day offered some advice for students in-
terested in ﬁlmmaking. ‘
“Watch as many moviesas you can,  dif-
ferent types, Have-ﬁm with it and just follow

ics for the ﬁlmmakers often include what type
of camera was used to shoot the ﬁlm, what
the motivation behind a eertain technique

For Day, it all comes down to the beneﬁt
and thrill of sharing a ﬁlm with a live audi-
ence, and this is where he feels Film Kitchen
ﬂourishes. l _

“You are guaranteed a certain quality of

in the venue, itself,” he said.

The biggest draw for many of the par-
ticipants, including Sweetland, however, is
the fact that “it’s all about sharing” different
outlooks and projects.

every bit of his 57 years. But why not pur-
sue Phoenix further? He’s only 39, looks

' younger than that and also has villain expe-

rience as Commodus in 2000’s ‘,‘Gladiator”
(as well as general acting wizardry).

Both Cranstgn and Phoenix have a sense
of conﬁdence about them that Eisenberg
lacks. He is unassuming and relaxed when
Luthor isstrictly driven by his ambition
'— and not in the screw—over-your-best-
friend-for— Facebook kind of way .— Luthor
corrupts and kills for world domination,
not social media.

Is the age-difference justiﬁcation
enough to pass on Phoenix or Cranston,
who has just proved to the world-that he can
play complex, evil characters such as Walter
White in AMC’s “Breaking Bad”? It’s hard
not to curse Snyder’s name in frustration
at this missed opportunity. '

Who knows? Maybe Eisenberg will pull
it off. I’m sure we’re all thinking back to the
reaction of when Heath Ledger was cast
as the]oke’r in “The Dark Knight” (2008),
which_resulted in an Academy Award~win—

I . ning performance for best supporting actor. '

Eisenberg’s best-actor nomination

matches Ledger’s from his portrayal of a gay _

cowboyl in “Brokeback Mountain” (2005)
before his drastically different role as the

-joker. Before “The Dark Knight,” Ledger ,

was atypecast actor like Eisenberg, only
instead of appearing in cheap comedies, he
did romance ﬂicks such as “10 Things I Hate
About You” (1999) and “Casanova” (2005).

There are similarities between the two
actors‘ going into this currently unnamed
Superman-versus-Batman project, but their
situations are indeed different.

For one, Snyder and company are under
seriousjpressure to make this ﬁlm a hit.
Ever since Christopher Nolan left the DC
Universe, Marvel Comics’ ﬁlm adaptations
have proved superior to any DC-character-
related movie not named “Batman.”

Plus, unlike Nolan’s debut bat ﬁlm, “Bat-
man Begins” (2005), “Man of Steel” tanked.

‘Superman fans are demanding some ret-
ribution for this next installment (myself
included), which is supposedly leading up
to a “justice League” ﬁlm or three. How are
they going to do that if Lex Luthor is a lean,
pimple—faced pushover?

I hate to preemptively dismiss this
ﬁlm, because a Superman-versus-Batman
feature hassome real potential. However,
casting Eisenberg as 'a conﬁdent, ambitious
killer doesn’t make sense right now. Hope-
fully it will by the time the movie premiers
in 2016.

From there, the ﬁlm explores one of
life’s great questions. Namely: If you make
the wo rld’s most boring man into a robot,
can anyone tell the difference?

Perhaps this isn’t quite the question
Padilha was going for, but Kinnaman’s mo-

he feels just as robotic before donning the

Throughout the past decade, progres-
sive coaches across the country — Pitt’s
Jamie: Dixon, included —— have shifted

‘B toward more statistics—based coaching

principles, hoping to ﬁnd loopholes in
the rules of college basketball while
developing smarter, more efficient ways
to score and defend the basketball.
Ken Pomeroy is one statistician —
and a former meteorologist a who is
responsible for much of this evolution.
Pomeroy’s extensive website, ken-

. pom.com, is a highly trafficked col-
’ lege basketball database containing -
’in—depth ratings and scouting reports

forlall 347 Division I teams and their ‘

players. It also features statistical

' coaching resumés. '

The site is frequented by coaches,

analysts‘, writers and gamblers all work— A

ing to individually evaluate players and

teams while predicting college basket-

ball game outcomes. . _
Simply put, Pomeroy’s player and

team ratings are box scores on steroids. -

They don’t value wins and losses, but

margin of victory and loss. Instead.

of acknowledging points per game,
emphasis is placed on a team’s points
per possession. Pomeroy also doesn’t
express interest in shooting percent-
age, but rather, the'amount of high-
percentage shots each player attempts.

Pomeroy’s statistical hub updates
daily with newpinformation. Pitt has
finished each of its seasons since 2003
rated in Pomeroy’s top 25, and Pitt play—
ers often appear in Pomeroy’s top of-
fensive player listings.

This season, the Panthers (20-6, 8-5

ACC) are rated No. 14 in Pomeroy’s poll,-

and senior guard Lamar Patterson is

Coastal Carolina made the NCAA Tour-
nament in 2013, while Pitt did not. But
it was the Panthers that looked like the
tournament team this past weekend.

The Pitt’s baseball team took two of
three games from the Chanticleers at
Pelicans Ballpark in Myrtle Beach, S.C.

The Panthers (2-1, 0-0 ACC) out-
scored Coastal Carolina (1-2, 0-0 Big
South) by a margin of 25-16 in three
games. Jordan Frabasilio and Boo
Vazquez led the way offensively with
four hits apiece; ~ _

Pitt struggled at the plate and in
the field, though, as the team commitj
ted nine errors and hitjust .205 in the
three—game series:

Pitt 7, Coastal Carolina 5 _

Through the first four innings, the
game was shaping up to be a pitchers’

" duel, as neither pitcher allowed a run

over that span.

Coastal Carolina ace Ben Smith did
not allow a hit over the first four in-
nings and struck out nine Pitt batters.

.Despite Smith’s high strikeout total,

the lefty struggled with his control, as
he walked four batters and hit another
with a pitch. 5

With his pitch _count mounting,

‘Baseball America’s No. 48 prospect was

chased fromthe game in the fifth inning
with two men out and the bases loaded,
despite having not al1owed'a hit.
Reliever Seth Lamando replaced

Smith and allowed the first hit of the ball ’
game, an inﬁeld single by Casey Roche

’ that plated the first run for either team.

The base hit gave the Panthers a slim

(1-0 lead. Following a perfect ﬁfth in-

ning, the Panthers tallied another run
on a Manny Pazos sacriﬁce fly.

In the bottom of the inning, senior
Matt Wotherspoon (1-0) looked to be in
control until sophomore second base-
man Dylan Wolsonovich committed a
costly error on a sureﬁre double—play
ball. The error extended the inning and
plated a run.

Following the error, Pitt head coach
Joe Jordano yanked Wotherspoon in
favor of lefty Jon Danielczyk, who was
able to escape the inning with a timely
double play. '

“Spoon gave us a chance today,” Jor-
dano told the team website. “He really
pitched a solid game and our bullpen
did a solid job, as well.” A

In the top of the next inning, the
Panthers extended their lead to 5-1
when transfer Frabasilio socked a
t-hree—run home runto left ﬁeld. Pitt
then tacked on a pair of insurance runs
in the top of the ninth inning.

“We looked a bit like it was the ﬁrst
time on a ﬁeld, at times a little rough,”
Jordano said. “But we had some great
situational at-bats and scored ﬁve runs
with two outs and that was the differ-
ence in the ball game.”

February 18, 2014 I The Pitt News I v\/vvvx/,pittnevvs.com

In the second game of the series,
neither starting pitcher was effective,
as Pitt’s Rhys Aldenhoven and Coastal
Carolina’s Tyler Herb allowed a pair of
runs in the ﬁrst inning.

In the bottom of the fourth, Alden-

hoven ran into a bit of trouble, allow-
ing a run before he was lifted from the
game. Junior college transfer Hobie
Harris took over for the senior from
Australia and got the ﬁnal out of the
inning. . ' .

Harris went on to pitch another four
innings of relief in which he allowed
three runs, but he earned a win after
the Panthers added three runs in both
the ﬁfth and seventh innings.

In the ﬁfth, Boo Vazquez drove two
runs home with a bases-loaded single,

' and Wolsonovich added a two—run.

double two innings later.'All-American

Casey Roche added a home run in the - ‘

top of the eighth inning for a 10-3 Pitt
lead. ‘ '

Jordano needed to call on Andrew
Belﬁglio after Harris ('1-O) failed to

record an out in the ninth and allowed .

three runs to'cross. Belﬁglio allowed an
RBI single to the ﬁrst batter he faced
before recording the ﬁnal three outs.

Q&A

In an interview with The Pitt News,
Pomeroy talked about his system’s an-
nual appreciation for Dixon’s scheme
and teams.

The Pitt News: What stats or ratings
do you use that Jamie Dixon’s teams
beneﬁt from the most?’

Ken Pomeroy: My system is based
off offensive anddefensive efﬁciency
and trying’ to'adjust that for strength
of schedule. And so margin of victory
comes into play there, and Pitt in the
past decade has a pretty decent track re-
cord of a few lopsided victories against
decent opponents, and that’s a source of

- their high ratings —— a combination of

that and generally playing good teams

Baseball D 13

really close when they lose.

TPN: Lamar Patterson has sat atop
your ACC offensive efﬁciency ratings
for thepmajority of the season. What
does that suggest about Patterson as
an offensive player? 3

KP: He’s very efﬁcient. He’s a really
good shooter, and furthermore, he has
an excellent assist rate. Whether he was
a point guard or not, [his assist rate]
would be a heck of a line, but the fact
that he’s a wing player makes it espe-

cially impressive. The things he 'does

that show up in the box score are good
things. They lead to points, and so that
ultimately is what that offensiveirating
captures 4 how efﬁcient is this player
when he does something? And Lamar
is extremely efﬁcient. I think people
nationally don’t give him enough credit
because Pitt plays at a very slow pace,

so when you look at counting stats, he’s
not going to fare quite as well as some-
one who plays on -a fast-paced team.
But given the framework that he has to
..survive in, he’s a very efﬁcient player.
- TPN: Four of Pitt’s six losses were
decided in the ﬁnal possession of play.
Should Pitt fans be optimistic about

their team considering the narrow"

margin of defeat in losses to the No. 3
(Duke), 5 (Syracuse, twice), 7 (Virginia),

24 (Cincinnati) and 25 (North Carolina)

teams in your poll?

KP: Yeah. Pitt deﬁnitely cornered
the market on good l'osses._]ust because
Tyler Ennis hits a miracle shot at the
buzzer doesn’t mean that Jamie Dixon

_ is going to think of his team any dif-
ferently in terms of how they played

that.[Syracuse] game, so going forward, .

there should be optimism. The problem

is that the basketball selection commit-

. tee is not going to look at those losses

the same way my computer does, so
they’re probably not going to getha great
seed in the NCAA Tournament, and
that’s going to affect their chances of
going deep there‘, but as far as whether
or not they have a Top 25 team, I think
certainly Pitt is one of the 25 best teams
in the country.

TPN: The Panthers are tied for 89th
in offensive rebounding this seasén with
12.2 per game, butjamie Dixon’s teams
are generally among the best offensive
rebounding teams in the country. How
valuable is offensive rebounding?

‘ KP: It can be very valuable. Usu-
ally, it’s something that Pitt depends
on because they’re typically not a good

shooting team. That’s deﬁnitely true

this year. They’re not a great shooting
team (46.2 percent, t~81st). Offensive
rebounds give you more cracks at the
basket, and it is:ve_ry important. The

one issue for them this year is that ‘-
they really aren‘t that great an offen— .

sive rebounding team.'iA.’5I:l'rey’ve really
struggled, especially against quality
competition. If they c_lon.’.t- improve their

offensive rebounding,_th'ey could have
a disappointing March“. . V *

TPN: Jamie .Dixon rarely brings in_

NBA—type offensive prospects that

thrive off one—on:one moves. With that
in mind, does your system suggest that
college teams with young NBA—type su-
perstars are better off than teams, such
as Pitt, that thrive off ball movement’
and more evenly distributed scoring?
KP: I think in’ general, to have post-
season success, it isbetter to have more

, balance in your offense than to have one

go-‘to guy. As you get in the tournament
and face better defenses, 'they’re able
to lock down on one player, and that

, player could have an off night, too, and
. that team doesn’t have a backup plan.
Sogenerally speaking, you want more '

balance in your offense. In terms of"

18

February 18, 20.14 | The Pill News I vvvwv.pitinevvs.com

it’s totally beneﬁcial to have a guy or"
two or three who areable to get their
own shot off when the defense breaks
down. I think that’s where Pitt has-
struggled in the past. They [havén’t]
really had guys like that necessarily,
so when they get in the tournament,
it becomes that much’ more difficult to
sustain offense. Their.offense is usually
underrated, but there’s that one weak—

ness typically wherethey don’t'h’ave a '
guywho can make things happen when '
fthe shot clock winds down.’ . ’

TPN: When you saw that Jamie Dixon
called a timeout up one with 4.4 seconds
to go, against Syracuse last week, did you
stopland think of a statistical reason as
to why calling a timeout there might not
be in Dixon’s best interest? '

KP: It was a really tough call on
whether to second-guess him or not.
Typically in that situation, a timeout

is in the defense’s best interest, but I’d '
[only] feel pretty strongly about that if —

there were 10 seconds left. With four
seconds left, it’s a little different be-
cause atthat point, the offense does
have _a disadvantage because there’s so

little time left. They have an advantage ‘

to set up “a play and try to actually get a
shot off. It ended—_up being a close call
in my mind. Thinking about it before

knowing the results, it’s a little more ~

difficult to blatantly criticize Jamie

started for the Chanticleers.
The Panthers struck first late ‘Sunday
afternoon when an Eric Hess sacriﬁce

- fly brought Steven Shelinsky Jr. ‘home

in the secondlinning.

But the Chanticleers struck for four,

runs to reclaim the lead in the third,
aided by a Zeuch error on a sacriﬁce
bunt. The misc_ue extended the inning
and Coastal Carolina capitalized with
four straight RBI singles with two outs.

The offensive outburst chased Zeuch
from the game, andJordano called upon
Renan Rodriguez to get the ﬁnal out of
the frame.

In the top of the ﬁfth, the Panthers
scored four times to regain the lead.
The big play was another bases—loaded

However, Dian allowed an RBI single
to Chanticleers catcher Tyler Chadwick
to tie the game. On the very next pitch,
Dian i(o-1) threw the Pall into center
ﬁeld on_a sacriﬁce-bunt attempt, allow-
ing the Chanticleers to take a 645 lead
that they "never relinquished.

Coastal Carolina added two more
runs in the bottom of the sixth before
closing the game out in the top of the
seventh. .

“It was a long day at the ballpark,”
Jordano said. “We did a solid job in
game one [of Sunday’s.doubleheader]
to win the series. We had an opportunity
in game two,’ but credit goes to Coastal

Carolina for scoring six runs with two
‘ outs.” ﬂ ’
