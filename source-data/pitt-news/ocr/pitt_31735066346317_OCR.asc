Alan C. Rankin, assistant chan-
‘zqjzellor of General Affairs, recently
announced that Dr. Richard L.
Rubenstein, director’ of B’nai
B’rith Hillel Foundation, will re-
view Leon M.vUr-is’ latest novel
“Mila 18" on Wednesday,‘ at 4:15
p.m. in the Fine Books Room of
The Book Center. -
In his novel “Exodus," Uris
wrote of the hardships faced by
the Israeli settlers.

In his latest work, he takes us
back to 1943 to a ghetto in War-
saw where heroic men and wom-
en of the Jewish faith sacriﬁced
their lives and “awakened the
spirit that led to the founding of
this new state and to the fulﬁll-
ment of a 200-year destiny.”

Dr. Rubenstein has just re-
,...-turned from a summer in Eu-
rope and Israel. He was the
guest of the Press and Informa-
tion Oﬂice of the West Ger-
man Government and spent ﬁve
days in East and West Berlin

he use of alcohblic beverages

The issue first arose at last week’s Student Government
meeting when a possiblerevision of administrative policy
toward alcoholic beverages on campus was suggested. A

the SG. Senate or the lnter—Fra-f
ternity Council would be the
proper body to raise such a prop-
osition.

The suggestion was withheld
for further study as to which
group should most properly ini-
tiate action. After the meeting,
however, according to Dan. John-
son, publicity director for Men’s
Council, it was agreed that IF
would be the more appropriate
body to originate such a motion.

' A similar suggestion was _then__
S brought before IF Council's
Wednesday evening meeting.
After some discussion, it was
brought to the Council’s atten-
tion that apparently ‘it is illegal
for any student to drink any-
where unless hc is 21 years old.‘

Advisors Provide For Special

Student Scheduliiig Prolil-ems

Jobs, Activities, Religious Restrictions Citerl
As Valid Excuses For Clianges In Class Time

John Funari, assistant to
nounced that new provisions

with special scheduling problems.

Special forms are available at the oﬂice of the Board of
Advisors on the 10th floor CL., oﬁice of Student Records
and oﬁice of Liberal Arts, 18th ﬂoor CL. for special schedul-

ing’ requests.

Some students cannot be sched-
uled for classes at certain times
for various reasons such as jobs,
activities, or, for religious reasons,
Funari said.

The employer," activity advi-
sor, or religious advisor is to ﬁll
out the form, Funari said.

The A fact that a student com-
mutes is not an acceptable rea-
son for special scheduling, the
assistant dean continued, “un-
less he lives so far away that it
would be unreasonable to re-
quire him to come." The stu-
dent wishing special considera-

“tion should bring‘ the ﬁlled out
form with him to pre-‘registra-T
tion and attach it to the regis-
tration form.

The student will receive no of-
ficial notiﬁcation whether his ap-

plication has been accepted as
valid or not until he receives his
invoice at the beginning of the
new trimester.

The new procedures came as a
result of many conflicts between
class scheduling and student ac-
tivities, outside employment, and
religious restrictions.

Funari feels that this system
will ease what was previously a

-confusing set of scheduling prob-

lems.

The answer to this objetcion
was that apparently fraternities
at other schools, notably those
at Penn State , and Carnegie
Tech. feel that the law does not
apply to them.

“. . 7. Can’t Buy Academic Excellence”

Chancellor Speaks to Convocation

,Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld emphasized
his “strategy of an organic institution” at the
Fall Convocation held Wednesday in Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall. « '

Labeling as a false concept the prevailing
view that we are trying to buy excellence, the
Chancellor stated that “we have less funds than
we need and even if we had they wouldn't be
enough."

We must, he continued, use our existing re-
sources of time, people, structures, and ﬁnance
to go farther than others can. V

He emphasized that there must be a partial.
academic relationship which is unfortunately
made difficult by departmental parochialism
“snobbery.” Being too‘ concerned with public re-
lations instead of the academic process is an--
other impediment to this .relationship, said the
Chancellor.

According to the Chancellor, an “organic
institution” uses it's resources to the ultimate
by the combined explorations of several fac-
ulties which results in a better mode of in-
struction. “We must break down departmental
r'igid.ity,” he said.

Stressing as problems to be faced in the “or-
ganic” development of the "University. he men-
tioned the retrogressive tendencies of research
since WW II and the poor position of the public

school system in western Pennsylvania.

lAin0S   Hall Dedicated

To First Women’s Dean

Thyrsa W. Amos Served as Dean i
For 20 Years; Founded Traditions

By JIM NELSON 4
Because the Schenley'Quadrangle has been designed

ultimately for Women’s residences, and because all of the
other buildings in the Quadrangle were dedicated to men‘,

c.Building A has been christened Thyrsa W. Amos Hall.

This, of course, is not the only reason Building A is

known as Amos Hall.

Thyrsa Amos was the first Dean¢

of Women of the University, and
she held this position for more
than 20 years. A .

Founded Local Association

The inﬂuence of Thyrsa Amos
was evident throughout the na-
tion. She served as president of
the National Association of Deans
of Women and founded the Penn-
sylvania Association of Deans of
Women. W

Miss Amos was a. leader in
the Federation of Business and
Professional Women’s Clubs,
The American Association of
University Women, and other
civic organizations.

She trained many Deans of
Women through her
courses here at the University and
at Columbia University, and she
spoke to audiences all over the
United States. A

"Establishes Traditions

Thyrsa Amos established many
of the traditions for undergradu-
ate women. Many of the rooms
of the 12th ﬂoor of the Cathedral
were given by alumni in her
memory.

Building A is designed to
house sorority headquarters,
with a small group of each sor-
ority in residence. ‘C

The building was dedicated
with the hope that through these
organizations this building will
come to be known as a center of
inﬂuence Iorhigh academic and
social standards among both resi-
dent and non-resident women,
and the name chosen should re-

call these values among the wom- ‘

en of the University.

Universit 
Conducts
Fallout Tests

The University is participating
in a nation-wide program to
standardize tests for detecting

. radioactive matter and other con-

taminants in air and water.

This program, called the Analy-
tical Reference Service (ARS), is
conducted through the Robert A.
Taft Sanitary Engineering Cen-
ter in Cincinnati, Ohio, a major
research center of the U.S. Public
Health Service.

ARS is a voluntary association
of governmental units, industries
and universities conducting labor-
atory programs.

Maurice Shapiro, associate pro-
fessor of sanitary engineering at
the University gave this explana-
tion of the ARS operation:

“Its conducted like a chemical
unknown In a college chemistry
class. The ARS people in Cincin-
nati periodically send samples to
-us.

“We analyze th e sample.
either by Standard methods, or
by our own methods. or by
methods prescribed by the Taft
Center. Then, we forward the
data from our findings to Cin-
cinatti.”

The Taft Center collects the
data from member agencies and
compares the results.

This provides a means of statis-
tically evaluating the accuracy of
currently approved methods used
"by laboratories having similar re-
sponsibilities, of exchanging infor-
mation on laboratory method
weaknesses, and of evaluating pro-

posed new laboratory methods. 1 V

Mens’ Residence Hall Council

announced today that since Octo-_

ber 13-15 is “Parents’ Weekend,”
open house will be held on Octo-
ber 14.. It will follow the Pitt-
West Virginia football game and
continue until 6 p.m.

“Many parents can only come to
the university’s campus once or
twice a year and then they are
unable to see their son’s, room, and
talking with his roommates and
their parents is difficult,” represen-
tative Ed Hall said;

The Council also held a meet-
ing to discuss its formal organiza-
tion and immediate activities.

Pete Bijur was elected temp-
orary chairman. Permanent ath-
letic chairman is Al Schlosser,
and Ed Hall was elected perma-
nent representative to the Pitt
News.

 Camiius Alcohol Ban DlSC11SSBt

(Continued from Page 1)
Friday at which alcoholic beve-
rages would be served and which
legalized the use of alcoholic beve-
rages in fraternity houses.

The party was cancelled, how-
ever, and IF Council agreed that
drinking was not possible at the

University at that time. Jim Gro— .

ninger, then IF president, said

that “Drinking is deﬁnitely not

lawful on our campus under the
present rules.”

The rules to which he was
referring were stated in a D01-

  
 

lcy decreed by the Board of
University Trustees which de- l
clared that alcoholic beverages i
shall not be sold or served to‘ _
undergraduates on any property ‘I...
of the University not at Uni.
versity-sponsored meetings or
functions.

Added to this policy is a 1951

 

ruling by the housing ‘area boardrijr
against drinking in the dormitor- 
ies. The ban was extended to frag )2
ternity and sorority houses in ,

Political problems and health‘
problems are inseparably inter-
related, says Dr. Peter Safar, chief
anesthesiologist at Presbyterian-
University Hospital. _

Di‘. Safar recently spent two
months on a medical mission to‘
India, Viet Nam and other Asian
Countries. In an address to the
Presbyterian Hospital Aid society
in the Health Center Nurses’ Resi-
dence, he pointed out that “Poli-
tics in Southeast Asia are ex-
tremely complicated and confuse
the westerner. '

“They cannot be separated
from the staggering health
p r o b I e m s of underdeveloped
countri s.

“Tuberculosis, malaria and in-
testinal infections ‘ are the most
prevalent. Preventive medicine-—
like simple sanitation and” the
teaching of hygiene——-must be the
primary goal of medical aid from

the United States.”

cording to his statistics there is
one physician for 60,000 Viet
Namese, 12 native physicians for
4,500,000 Cambodians and none
at all for 4,000,000 Laotians.
“The sick native can only go

nurse, or to a charity hospital in
a far-away city which is poorly-
equipped, tremendously under-
staffed, and running on a budget
of 70 cents per patient day,” he
observed. . '

Unapplied Measures

Such  are not applied, hovveveer, in our
University’s series of writing courses. Writing, be
it journalistic, scientiﬁc -or ﬁctional, is as much an

art as emoting on the boards or producing great

water colors, and the importance of communica-
tions «cannot be overemyhasized in these jumbled
times. But the lack of a talent requirement for

admission to ‘specialized writing courses has ham- ,

Dered our writing program: it has been detirimrentarl
to both. the instructors and students involved.
There is no reason, for example, that an in-
Sfr~uC¢0r of .easay-writing must spend most of his
time  a student’s work  spelling correc-

tions and suggestions for paragraph impro'vemen7t~
—mstead of criticising his sense of expression or

a~sth».etic —aibility. There‘  no reason other 1.,h,a,n

Education Talks

By MATT SWETONIC

During his visit to Europe last
summer, Dr. Shepherd L. Wit
man, head of the University's Of-

fice of Cultural and Educational:
Exchange, attended the first in a
series of international seminars to ~

be he.ld annually for the purpose
of developing co—operative edu-
cational programs between our
country and the nations of Europe

 

Meeting in
in the Hague, the Netherlands,
the seminar was sponsored by the
University, the Intercollegiate
Council, and the Netherlands’
University Foundation.

In addition to Dr. Witman. six-

other University faculty members
were among the 24 participants

at the week long meeting. Dr. A.‘

C. VanDusen. vice chancellor of
the professions; Dr. and Mrs. -Wil-
liam H. Johnson, chairman of
foundation of education.

Dr. Gloria Rose of the Music
Department; Dr. Albert B. Mar-
tin. dean of the School of the
Liberal Arts; and Miss Wynfred
Joshua of the Cultural and‘ Ex-
change Office, co-ordinator of
the seminar.

The purpose of the meeting, ac-—
cording to Dr. Witman, was to
provide the 12 American and
Dutch representatives with “an
opportunity to explore each
other’s ideas and the characters
of their individual educational
system.” A

Emphasizing in their discus-
sions the “relationship of edu-
cation to the -cultural’ environ—
ment of which it is a part” the
members attempted to expand
the international interest in
their own universities.

Timed so as to enable the
American representatives to make
use of the yearly chartered ﬂight
from the University to Europe,
the meeting, Dr. Witman feels.
did much to develop the‘ cul-
tural relationships between ours
and foreign universities.

Records Oifice
Lists Deadline
For Graduates

Anthony P. Athens, assistant
director of Student Records, an-
nounced that students wishing to
retake courses to remove low
grades should ﬁll out new forms

available at the advisers’ offices
during registration.

_Unless this form is forwarded
to the Office of Student Records,
no adjustment will be made on
the student’s transcript, Athens
said. He explained that the forms
have been made to minimize con-
fusion that will arise over what
course replaces what course be-
cause of the numbering change in
LA courses.

The Oﬁ’ice of Student Records
also made these two announce-
ments:

The deadline for applications for
graduation for all divisions, ex-
cept the Graduate Disciplines, is
Wednesday.

All male students eligible for
the draft should file application
for issuance of a College Student
Certification to his local draft
board. The certiﬁcation can only
be made if the student applies for
it in the Office of Student Re-
cords.

,, .‘ Corky Hits

The Cats were down, 3-2, as
the fourth quarter began, but the
strong forward line was about to
change that. CorkyCuth'bert found
the range with fourteen minutes
gone in the ﬁnal stanza, assisted
by Chuck Dunbar, who was in at
right wing after recovering from a
slight leg injuryincurred early in
the contest.

Then, only three minutes
later, Pete Smith found Cuth-
bert in the open again, executed

' a perfect pass, and Corky didn’t
muff the chance. That gave
Bemis’ booters the ﬁnal margin.

Pete Milich of Akron had given
the home team a 2-1 edge early in
the second period, scoring his sec-
ond goal of the afternoon, after
Pete Smith had jumped the Pan-

thers off to a 1-0 lead midway-

through the first quarter.
Weir Ties It

Eric .Weir tied it up at 11:45 of
the second canto, assisted by
Cuthbert, and matters stood 2-2‘ at
the half.

Akron’s Frank Abel counted at

period, setting the
Cuthbert’s two scores.
Analyzing the ‘victory, Bemis

was “pleased with the boys’ ﬁne

tively bottled up Zip All-Amen

gusted with his own and the

Mazurek, Novak Lead
F rosh to 36 — 0 Win

By BOB SMIZIK
Lack of goodquarterbacking will not be one of the Fresh-
men football team’s problems this season as was evidenced
by their outstanding performance against Kent State last
Thursday. Signal—callers Fred Mazurek and Fran. Novak
sparked an explosive Cub attack that rolled over their hosts,

backs Bill Beck, Nick Warrino,
Bob Gaffney and Tom Ferraco for
yeoman duty on defense, in addi-
tion to the entire Cub end corps.

“I was well pleased with the
punting and kicking of Tom Black
and the play of Bill~Bodle,” Kali-
den said. Bodle played fullback,
right and felt halfback and “never
missed an assignment” according
to the coach. He has been dubbed
“the ironman” by teammates.

The Fresh go back to the prac-
tice ﬁeld until October 20, when
they will meet West Virginia,
where they will iron out any flaws
that may have caught Kaliden’s
eye in Thursday’s encounter.

were screaming above a de-

Stadium, roars from an im-

promptu campus rally were
resounding from the hill near-
by, and dead silence prevailed in
the Pitt dressing room as another
unpalatable last minute loss was
being digested by some bewilder-
ed Panthers.

That sweet essence of victory
had been stolen from them once
again; it seemed like another en-
core for Baylor; as the Huskies

scored on a 42-yard pass-play in

the closing moments to 22-17. The
only scent biting their nostrils

then were sweat and medicinal’

lotions.
“It was just like Christmas in
October,” Washington Captain

Ray Mansﬁeld, a boastful gent of
the Cyrano de Bergerac school,
remarked. Granted he could give
Cyrano a run for his money in

gallant sword—yielder couldn’t
have stabbed the Panthers more
critically. “They was pretty soft.
We gave them everything they
got.” ’

Sam Colella, a fella who stares

ALL-AMERICAN DADS ’

Stanley Woodward shuns the publicity releases that shout
hallelujah about “the greatest player ever to hit the Corn-
belt” and is one of the few footballp“experts” who looks
farther than his desk to see what kids in the country are bona-
fide All-America candidates.

This yearihe picked two young fathers to man the guard
slots on his second team selection, Diane ‘Skaggs and.Larry
Vignali, Jr., two-infant tykes, weren’t aware of their father’s
misconduct, but Washing_ton’s Jim Skaggsand Pitt’s Larry
Vignali were squaring off occasionally at Washington Uni-
versity Stadium in Seattle“ on Saturday afternoon, belting

-each other with wicked blocks all day. ' , ’

Skaggs wasn’t the only one belting the short, wide and
chunky Panther guard, however. Almost like the “sweet-
ness and lightness” scripts of pro» wrestling’s tag-team.
matches, Vignali was being pummeled by two adversaries.-.

& groan circuit, was hitting Larry, too.

“He was a real pursuer, alright.” Mansﬁeld conceded.of i

Vignali. .“But he was soft, not hard when I hit him with the
inital block. Against any other center he might be alright‘,
but ask Tom Brown of Minnesota. He wassupposed to have‘
’ /been the terror of the Big Ten, but we wrapped him up.”

This blast at Vignali’s prowess offended Rege Coustillac,
Vignali’s fellow guard and best friend immensely. “Vignali
got double-teamed every play. You can’t run against Vignali
with one man blocking for you.” , . ' - T
, ‘‘Ziggy’s the best,” Coustillac said, seething with disgust
at Mansﬁe1d’s slam. “It’s not hard to double—team anyone.
But we didn’t double—team Skaggs. /One man took care of

 Coustallac,_grizzly-looking witha slight beard, grinned

ﬁeld~’s remarks, saying. “He did something Larry would never
do. ,‘I was heading straight for him inpthe open ﬁeld, and he
dodged me——-Larry would’ve ran right over me!” I

Coustillac admited the Skaggs was good. “He didn’t move’

wellla-teirally on the ﬁlm that we saw before the game, but
he sure did against us.” Coach Jack» Wiley said, “Skaggs
bothered us quite a bit in the ﬁrst half, but we adjusted.”

On Vignali, Skaggs remarked,s“H_e was pretty good on
pass-defense. He’s not really the ballplayer that’ Brown was,
but he’s darn good. I can’t really judge accux“-'ately, however,
because after the play starts I don’t know who the Hell I’m
hittin’. I don’t notice any numbers. Mansﬁeld might, but I

‘Wherever one turned in the S

Olmpic Hotel in Seattle, Wash-
ington: the elevator, the lobby,
the dining room, he was likely
to be stormed upon by a bulky
fellow who had a legitimate
beef. Huskier than any of Pitt’s

tackles, this football buff cried,
“Boy, those centers are bad. That

killed you, andit doesn’t even‘

show up in the statistics.”

“What’s John (Michelosen) go-
ing to do about it,” he queried
every other minute. “You see I
played for pol’ Jock Sutherland at
Pitt, and I was a center. When
you play a certain position like
that .you’re- bound to be critical
of your peers, but these kids were
bad today.”

“I had two cousins that were

centers, and I have three sons——
all centers,” the old-timer went
on. “Now I know you have to
practice snapping those long
throws back to the punters for
long sessions if you expect to
be machine—like.

“Those kids today were ﬂipping
that ball every- which way. That
throws the kicker off balance be-
cause that snap—back’should be
quick, and right there,” he said,
emphasizing the point by thrust-
ing his hands forward.

“And you can’t get it back
there too fast, either,” he dis-
closed. “Why those balls were
coming back soft. Those kids have
got to start working every day.
What’s John going to do about
it?” -

Nothing much he can do.

Just like Colella-,, Rege Coustil-
lac, almost oblivious of a painful
knee injury, waved his head in
“We should be--three
and oh now. I feel sorry for the
coach. Something should be said
about it.” 2

Coach John "Michelosen said
something about it. “Last week
I said our sophomores were still
growing up. Well, it wasn’t all
sophomores who were making
those mistakes,” Michelosen dis-
closed. “We played good enough~
to win. I have pretty much the
same feeling as last‘ week.”

Jim Owens, whose team dump-
ed Illinois last week, had pretty -
much the same feeling as last
week, «too. ‘fIt was a wild and
woolly game,” the handsome Hol-
lywood-type said. “It was a great
win.” , \

Pete Ohler, a gaunt Canadian‘
who passed the Huskies to a win
in avsurprise debut as if he were
merely driving a team from a.
trailing sled up in the Yukon, re-
marked, “I2 haven’t been good
enough. They just decided to
gamble on me.” Owens should try
his hand 'at dice. The Pitts feel
like playing roulette —’Russian

 Soccer May

   

Reap Good
With Aid
Three Players
Recruited For

Future Booting

Soccer is on the upturn in
Panther. booting circles. Leo
Bemis has procured that
gilded treasure that every
minor sport coach longs for
-—-scholarships. He is now en-
visioning allusions of Pitt’s rise

to power in soccer.
. His dreams are not unfounded

either. It’s true that his newfoundi

aid allowed him to acquire only
three‘ new top-flight players, but
he is hoping that this helps the
cause, and it should.

Bill Kovacs of Bethlehem, Ed

Weichenbach, of Middleburg, and

George Shimpeno of Springdale

initiated the new program, coming.

here early this fall. Kovacs hails
from the Pennsylvania town, not
the one in Judea. Bemis is prob-
ably anxious to start recruiting
there, however. 0

Panther soccer teams have al-
ways been a mixing bowl for im-
ports from foreign countries. The
team huddles often resemble a
caucas at the United Nations.
Bemis insists, however, that it is
possible to ﬁnd ace booters, Amer-
ican style.

His yearlings and scrubs have
been turned over to Bill Summers
again this season. Summers is
normally the tennis coach, sec-
ondly the squash coach, and be-
cause of the tight athletic budgets,
he is now a full-fledged soccer
coach.

Summer says, ‘‘I’m still learning
this game. I’m familiar with the
nets because I lofted balls over
them in the past, but the footwork
is somewhat more complicated."

_ Summers is hoping that his pro-
digies learn along with him, so
that Leo Bemis can reap the bene-
ﬁts of his new investments.

Trfcat onuered Slow Draw]

Jim Traficant’s brush-beaten
brown coiffure, which slips over
his tan brow, causes many on-
lookers to concost an image of
Marlon Brando, probably best
in his portrayal of Marco An-
thony in “Caesar.”

Actually the quarterback from
Youngstown, Ohio would prob-
ably rather appear, under the
marquee in the production of
“Streetcar Named Desire.” De-
sire is surely epitomized by this
Panther signal-caller.‘

When Trafficant first arrived
at Pitt, the players were badly
confused by his off-beat cadence
when calling signals. His timing
in sounding the numbers over
center was perceptibl.y differ-
ent than his fellow signal call-
ers. His slow drawl was strictly
Brando.

“He sounded like Yogi Bear,”
one grinning halfback disclos-

K

ed. Jim worked on his speech,
habits, and overcame the de-
feet.

He completed 29 of 57 passes
for 407 yards and four touch-
downs. He scored, two touch-
downs, including one against
Syracuse in ‘the dynamic 10-0
upset of the Orange. Traficant
was badly injured in this game,

however.

This year he came to pre-
season camp at Meadville, Pa.
in his best physical shape ever.
He had proved during the spring
drills that the quarterback job
a freak accident left him
sprawling on the turf, writhing
in pain.

He was carried off the field,
his knee and ankle badly hurt.
The fiery Traficant was sputter-
ing expletives that might even
redden the ears of the Steeler’s

Bobby Lane. Jim was out.

In a recent Washington Red-
skin pro football game, Jim Cun-
ningham, 1ast,year’s Pitt fullback,
hobbled to the sidelines in the
first period with a dislocated
ankle. “I really had to clean the
cupboard. for backs,” Redskin
coach Bill McPeak disclosed.
“When Cunningham came out, we
snapped the ankle into place, gave
him a shot, and sent him back
in.” I

Julius Levin was a sports writ-
er for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
some years ago. He was in New
York on assignment when a holy-
day of Judaism arrived. He wired
his sports editor the following
wire: “Yom Kippur starts today.----
fast.” Havey Boyle, the boss ,re-

plied with another wire: “Put
$200 on him to place —- sounds
like a good tip.”» _

upon your willingness to give. of

never was a horse that couldn’t
be rode nor a man that couldn’t

the immortal Will Rogers there.
