Experts tackle infant mortali

By Tim Hunter
Staff Writer
Approximately 30 black infants

of every I000 born in the Pittsburgh
area died during 1982, while the rate

for white ‘infants was only I2 for-

every I000, according to specialists
on infant mortality. ’

This problem, and ways to reduce
it, will be discussed on campus

tomorrow’ during a conference

entitled “Black Infant Mortality: A
Plan for Action,” gionsored by the
Urban League of Pittsburgh and the
Pittsburgh March of Dimes.
“l982’s data is representative of
the data we have been collecting for
the past I2 years from 29 U.S. cities
with populations greater than
500,000,” said Ronald David, assis-
tant professor of pediatrics, obstet-
rics and gynecology at the
University of Pittsburgh. “Our f2-
year study shows Pittsburgh consis-
tently ranks in the top five. In fact, in
1982 it had the highest infant mor-
tality rate in the nation. The only
city with a worse record is Chicago.”

David explained that part of the
reason for Pittsburgh’s high rate is
that it has a more complete data col-
lection process than other cities.

David added that the overall U.S.
infant mortality rate is above aver-
age among developed nations in the
world. “The health care of children
in general and black infants in par-
ticular is simply not a priority for
our governments — federal and
local,” he said. “Until it becomes a
greater priority, infant mortality will
persist as a major health problem."

David will hold a workshop at
tomorrow’s conference to discuss
locations of the health faci_lities in
the Pittsburgh area and their availa-
bility to the target population of
pregnant women.

Dr. Eberhard Mueller—Heubach
of Magee-Womens Hospital will be
one of the keynote speakers for the
conference. He will speak about a
program to study premature births,
which he hopes to set up in the Pitts-
burgh area with a grant from the
Pittsburgh March of Dimes.

“Infant mortality is largely related
to the rate of premature deliveries
(children born below 5-1 /2 pounds),

and premature deliveries are largely

related to socio-economic circum-
stances of the parents," Mueller-
Heubach said. “We are not sure if
the high black infant mortality is due
to their social circumstances or I
‘there is a specific problem among

. the black population.”

Mueller-Heubach’s program,
which was initiated in France, ap-
plies a scoring system to pregnant
women. This system is based on such
areas of lifestyle as smoking and
drinking habits and economic situa-
tions of the women. These women
will then be carefully followed
throughout their pregnancy; they
will also be given special instructions
to recognize symptoms leading to
premature birth. , "

“With this approach, we hope to
identify patients in pre-term labor
early enough to stop their labor,”
Mueller-Heubach said.

Tomorrow’s conference will begin
at 8 a.m. with keynote speakers in
David Lawrence Auditorium
throughout the morning. Work-
shops will take place in the after-
noon at the Graduate School of
Public Health.

Pitt’s pre-professional advising
office, which had been scheduled to
close July 31 because of budget cuts
in the Office of the Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs, will remain
open —- at least for the next year.

L A temporary solution has been
reached to keep the office intact,
according to Dean Irwin Schulman
of the College of Arts and Sciences.

Funding for the office. which is in
Room 207 of the William Pitt Union
and gives advice to undergraduates
on how to apply to medical, dental
and other professional schools, will
be shared for the next year by the
office of student affairs, CAS, the
provost‘s office and the office of
administration, he said.

After a series of conversations
between Schulman, vice—chancellor
for student affairs Connie Kirnbo
and other university officials, the

decision to keep the office open was
reached in mid-May, according to
Della Hudson-Tomlin, Pitt’s pre-
professional adviser. _

‘‘I’m very elated about the deci-
sion. It was a combination of people
who helped to save the office. I was
not included in any of the discus-
sions, nor was I invited to the ﬁnal
meeting,“ she said in an interview
yesterday.

“I'm very excited about it because
I think it's a very valuable position.
For the students, I don't see how
they can get the needed information
as easily without a full-time person
to investigate all the avenues
available.“

“If there was no adviser present,
the pre-professional advising com-
mittee would have resigned. too.”
she added, referring to the three pro-
fessors who have served as a support
group for the office by reviewing stu-
dent applications and making
recommendations.

Since Hudson-Tomlin took her

Pre-professional advising ‘saved’

job as adviser last November, the
office has served almost 400 stu-
dents, she said. In addition to the
advisor, the office staff includes one
secretary, Marette Simpson, who
works» in pre-professional advising
on a half-time basis.

A proposal to move the office to
the CAS Advising Center on the
ninth floor of the Cathedral of
Learning was considered in April,
Schulman said. However, he said he
believes the decision to leave it in its
present location will be for the best.

“It wouldn’t have created a
burden [for CAS], but I saw Della
Hudson-Tomlin’s office and how it
worked. It's a good operation and
any changes would lower its quality.

Although the solution is only a
temporary one, Schulman predicted
a permanent solution will be found.
“Pre-professional advising is a serv-
ice every college has. It's
indispensable."

Studies. He also served as its executive dean in 1977-78, 1980-81 and
I983. His experience in teaching shipboard classes dates back to 1972.

 

Medfacuilty agent

to be recertified’?  

By Michele Rhodes  
Staff Writer

Momentum towards a more

active interest in issues of faculty

unionization is building at Pitt’s
School of Medicine,.according to
several faculty physicians inter-
viewed earlier‘ this week.

The Faculty Association of the
School of Medicine will continue to
function as the agent of the medical
faculty, according to Dr. Stephen
Phillips, secretary/treasurer of that
organization. Last month's condi-
tional decertification ruling by the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board will be challenged and possi-
bly reversed as a result of a vote
taken at the June 5 meeting of
FASM membership, he said.

According to Phillips, FASM‘s
executive board is currently drafting
a report of the meeting at which a
majority of the nearly 200 faculty
members present voted to re-
establish the agent. This report will
be sent to the PLRB in an effort to
reaffirm FASM‘s intentions to
remain the agent of the medical
faculty.

Although FASM, established in
I976, has never functioned as a true
bargaining agent for the medical
faculty, some pro-union faculty
believe that its very existence was
considered by Pitt administrators as
a threat to their efforts to thwart the
unionization drive currently being
organized in other areas of the uni-
versity. The June 5 FASM meeting
may reverse the conditional decerti-

fication that university admiiiistra- _

tors had apparently accomplished
after they sponsored departmental

referenda at the medical school in

late April. .‘
Traditional labor issues such as

salary and working conditions are

not considered majorlproblems in

the school. Many medical faculty
members are concerned, however,
that their power to govern within the
school may be decreased unless they
become more involved with F ASM,
according to biochemistry professor
Robert Glew. 7

“There has never been a need to
bargain for salary. There is a need,
however, to bargain for govern-
ance," heisaid.

Glew discussed a common theme
which surfaced in recent interviews
with various medical _ faculty
members. More medical faculty are
recognizing their need to “become
more activist and less reactionary”
in t-he school‘s dealings with univer-
sity administration, he said.

According to Glew, this is espe-
cially true in light of four recent
events: the administration‘s treat-
ment of recently departed assistant
dean Robert Olson; their handling
—- and returning —— of a controver-
sial $2 million grant for nutrition
research; their “heavy-handed" pur-
suit of FASM decertification; and

their efforts to incorporate the

medical-related biological sciences
with science departments outside of
the School of Medicine.

The recently renewed interest in
FASM is “an absolute response to
the stupidity of [the administra-
tion‘s] actions. There are those who,
despite having basically anti-union
sentiments, feel that they are in a
better position with a separate, inde-
pendent agent," one medical faculty
member, who asked not to be identi-
fied, said Monday.

Opinions

Letter to the Editor  
Radio, radio: to what end?

1 must agree with the Pitt adminis-
trators, who have decided to take
control of Pitt's radio station. I'm
glad they’re taking over.

God (the Lord) only knows what
would happen if students were
allowed to run things. We’d get
nothing but a bunch of that offen-
sive and completely evil music. Like
that station run by the devil himself
—- WRCT. Did you ever hear some
of that trash and sewage and gar-
bage they let those kids spew out
over our beautiful airwaves? lt’s
loud, offensive music telling kids to
react to things and to think for
themselves.

Can you imagine?! Lord (God)
only knows that Pitt students have
enough to worry about with going to
class and getting good grades and
getting a job and resisting change
and staying conservative and nice.
without having to worry about a lot
of thinking.

Music should soothe the mind
and the soul. It should speak of love
and the Lord (God). It should not
clutter up our students‘ minds with
doubt and maybe feeling like things
aren’t going so well in the world.

I’m confident that Pitt’s new edu-
cational station will educate every-
one on how great Pitt is and how

 

good and nice those wonderful
administators are.

Remember: Music, especiallythat
subversive kind, will make kids start
cutting their hair all weird and not
listening to the authorities and not
doing what they’re supposed to be
doing. Do you want a bunch of kids
running around like they did in the
‘60s, screaming and yelling and not
getting goodjobs and not even want-
ing to serve their country in war? Of
course not. So grab hold of that
radio station. Its the first step.

The abolition of student rcldio

[just heard that Pitt’s l4-year-old
student-run AM radio station,
WPGH, has signed off for good. At
the same time, vulturous plans for a
“more professional” station, to be
called WPTS (“the pits"), are
swooping down upon the cadaver of
what was once the student body’s
station.

The new radio station is going to
be an “educational” station. Oh,
how students love to be reminded of
their homework while driving home!

The administration is reacting

ning to “supervise” (read: control)
its output. This, they say, is partly
due to an unfavorable view of the
CMU radio station, to which they
want never to be found comparable.

I share the contempt for WRCT
and the ill health of its audible out-
put. but it has a lot in common with
this new idea for campus radio at

  

LUXURY FURNISHED

Pitt. Basically, you have one group
of people imposing their tastes upon
another group of people. The differ-
ence is that WRCT is acting legiti-
mately as a forum for ‘student tastes,
whereas this new Pitt station (W-
PITS) has in mind the abolition of
this basic student freedom.

Well, after all, it is I984.

Bord’s Festivol off to running siori

By Bryan Fischer
Senior Editor

As a dark tragedy that
explores the possibilities for evil
present in all of us, Macbeth cer-
tainly ranks as one of the most
compelling dramas written in the

  

English language. In choosing to
open its fifth season with Shake-
speare’s classic tragedy of

human nature, the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival has chal-
lenged itself stifﬂy — and
responded admirably.

ambition made up equal parts
illusion and delusion.

The play begins slowly. tem-
porarily crawling toward the
struggle with evil that is central
to the play. Not until the dagger
scene does Daniel Southern’s
Macbeth involve the audience in
the torturous conflict of human
nature his charecter symbolizes.
From this point, however, the
action moves quickly, and all of
the play‘s crucial scenes are done
extremely well.

Of particular note are the
scene that depicts the discovery
of Duncan‘s murder, with all its
excitement and chaos; the ban-
quet sequence in which the ghost
of the murdered Banquo haunts
Macbeth; and Lady Macbeth‘s
infamous sleepwalking scene.

The climax of the play is
equally impressive. As the
prophecies of the wierd sisters.
which Macbeth believes have
made him invincible. begin to
bury him in defeat, the stage

becomes almost a revolving
door, brilliantly contrasting the
meek and staggering Macbeth
with the glory of Macduff, who
has come to revenge the death of
his family and preserve the
future of Scotland.

Confined in terms of dramatic
possibilities by the dwarfed stage
of Stephen Foster Memorial,
Macbeth relies on the single
quality that is able to distinguish
formidable theater —~ gifted
acting.

and seductive. Barney conveys
the necessary passion that allows
one to be easily drawn into the
murky evil Lord and Lady Mac-
beth bring about. Adding a
touch of erotica to the part, Bar-
ney creates a Lady Macbeth who
exudes all the horror that the

play speaks to.

Hugh Rose and Jim Stubbs
turn in fine performances as well
in the roles of Banquo and Mac-
duff, two Scotsmen who come
quickly to realize the tangled
affairs of Macbeth‘s mind. These
four fine performances, how-
ever, are backed up by many
impressive minor characters
who add a further touch of pro-
fessionalism to the production."

This chilling, season-opening
enactment of murder and com-
pulsion proves that some ofliter-
ature‘s greatest themes hold as
proud a place on the stage ofthe
17th century as they do today,

and the Three Rivers Shake-_

By Laurie Kubll
Staff Writer

The ’60s was a time of social upheaval and change.
Everyone had a ‘cause — from Vietnam and racial
discrimination to personal lifestyle, from the length of a
no-win war to the length of one’s hair.

As the Vietnam War neared its end in 1972-1973,
American citizens were confronted with the Watergate
scandal and the killing of four Kent State University
students by National Guardsmen.

Congress, in turn, was busy piecing together legislation
that would face ﬁerce opposition and bitter legal battles. It
took the department of Health, Education and Welfare
seven years to finalize the policy decisions that became Title
IX.

Title IX of the Education Amendment Act of 1972 bans
sexual discrimination in any educational program or
activity conducted at an institution that receives federal aid.
This includes post-secondary schools as well as elementary
and high schools.

The amendment reads: “No person in the United States
shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in,
be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any education program or activity receiving federal
financial assistance.”

According to the National Association for Girls and
Women in Sport (GWS), “It covers both students and
employees  It bars discriminatory policies in academic
and extra-curricular activities, counseling, physical educa- ~
tion, student housing, athletics, faculty, staff and student
employment and any other activity carried on or benefit ' a
provided by educational institutions.”  

HEW gave recipients of federal money three years to I
comply with the ruling after it went into effect in I975. By _

December 1978, few institutions had complied, many I
claiming that the law was ambiguously worded.

Much of the controversy stemmed fromthe amendment’s ‘ ii
section on athletics. Opposition to the legislation came
largely from the NCAA, which claimed that Title IX would

destroy men’s athletics. .
Following enforcement of Title IX, the NCAA began 
taking women’s athletics seriously. Its power and prestige . I 7 ‘

could not be matched by the governing body in women's
sports, the AIAW, which takes credit for passage of Title \
IX.

Unable to maintain itself in the face of the NCAA, the
AIAW folded after eight years. Candace Hogan likened the
NCAA takeover to “the fox guarding the chickens.”

According to the co—chairs of the Congressional Caucus
on Women's Issues, the 9 percent rise in the number of
women in four—year colleges and universities and the II
percent increase in women attending two-year schools can
be traced to Title IX. The same is true for law, dental and
medical schools, they said. ,

The number of athletic scholarships for women has risen
from none to l5,000 at the college level.

“Title IX has been the catalyst for dramatic gain-s in the
educational opportunities of women and girls,” said the
GWS.

Nevertheless, the bill is still steeped in controversy.

In addition to the NCAA, legislators have attempted to
weaken the effect of Title IX. Rep. George Hansen
(R-Idaho) and Sen. Paul Laxalt (R~Nev.) both proposed
bills thatyvould abolish the act.

Neither this legislation nor the bill introduced to dissolve
the Education Department have been passed.

On February 28 of this year, the Supreme Court ruled in
favor of a much narrower interpretation of the law, stating
that Title IX applied only to those college departments or
programs that received federal aid and not to the college as
a whole.

Women’s rights groups considered the ruling a major
defeat for educational opportunities for females.

The case involved Grove City College, a private school of
2200 students, located 60 miles north of Pittsburgh. The
college refused to sign the Title IX compliance form the
Carter administration introduced in 1977.

Institutions not in compliance with Title IX face loss of
government aid; however, according the GWS, “not a single
school, college or university has lost federal funding due to
violations of Title IX."

Grove City president Charles S. MacKenzie disagrees

‘with the tight grip that Title IX gives the government over
educational institutions. “NC D6fSOf'l in the United STOTGS shall, 0!’! #19
“Our concern is that, as history demonstrates, even basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, I
be denied the benefits of. or be subjected to —
discrimination under any education program or i *4’ 4
activity receiving federal financial assistance.”

limited government control inevitably spreads like a virus to
become inclusive control," MacKenzie stated.

MacKenzie adamantly denied any discrimination on the
part of the college, which he says has approximately the
same number of male and female students.

One student, Holly Over, agreed with MacKenzie.

‘A major assumption of much of the national media and
women's rights groups has been that Grove City College
wishes to preserve independence in order to practice sex
discrimination with the women students,” Over said.

“I, for one, can attest to the fact that we women students
are not discriminated-‘against. Grove City College is a
private liberal arts college which neither seeks nor accepts
direct federal grants in any form.

“We wish to maintain our academic independence, and
our decision not to sign the Title IX form is based on that
principle.”

The Supreme Court Justices determined in a vote of 6-3
that Grove City is subject to Title IX regulations because
approximately 300 of its students receive federal (Pell)
grants, which go to the college to pay for their education.

The Court targeted Grove City’s student aid office in the
ruling.

Justices Powell, Burger and O’Connor dissented, calling
the case an “unedifying example of overzealousness on the
part of the federal government.”

GWS maintains that the ruling will have a detrimental
effect on the rights of girls and women, saying, “The
uncertainty created by Grove City will mean that existing
discrimination will go unchecked and new acts of discrimi-
nation will be encouraged.”

Grove City College will terminate its federal financial aid
program and no longer enroll Pell Grant students.

The $300,000 that students annually receive from the
government will be supplied through private sources,
according to MacKenzie, who said the alumni are “fully
behind” the college.

The Grove City ruling has attracted national media
attention because it appeared to be a reversal of recent
trends. -

Sixty-one senators are sponsoring a bill that would ,
broaden the coverage of Title IX, as well as Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975,
according to Associated Press writer Maureen Santini.

Professors at the University of Pittsburgh believe it will
not have much effect here for different reasons.

Dr. Mary DuQuin of the School of Education says that
colleges will continue on their paths of discrimination or
non-discrimination, regardless of the court ruling.

“Pitt won’t do anything until they’re sued for bias, as far
as Title IX goes.” However, DuQuin did not call the Grove
City decision a step backwards.

Assistant Dean Siebergerof the Law School at Pitt said
that Pitt has a “strong internal policy of non-
discrimination."

Sieberger called the attention given to Grove City “a big
puff of smoke.” He exemplified MacKenzie’s aversion to
pushing paper. In reference to signing the Title IX
compliance forms, he said, “You don‘t go to the police
precinct and say, ‘I did not rob a bank.‘ ”

Sieberger said that Pitt is “positive” in its actions, but the I
ruling may hurt women in other institutions.

“The place where it would be felt is in states that do not
have a strong [policy of] non—discrimination in the state or
within the institution.”

In addition to Grove City, two other colleges have also
refused to sign compliance forms.

Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, won

L back its tax—exempt status after the U.S. government had
originally determined that it should not enjoy such
classification since it did not comply with Title IX
legislation.

University president Bob Jones III said he enjoys his
school’s “debt-free” status. \

Hillsdale College in Michigan raised $29 million in
private funds after it was denied federal funds for
noncompliance with the Title IX ruling.

The Grove City case has reached the end of its rope —— a
rope that some see as strangling the rights of women, but
that others view as a hindrance to independent educational
institutions. To some, thesupreme Court ruling was merely
a compromise.

Whatever the case may be, the issue of government
control versus the rights of individuals is an ongoing legal
battle‘ over which the dust has not yet settled.

For Pitt baseball coach Bobby Lewis, assistant Larry Wayman and five Panther players, a
childhood fantasy was fulfilled yesterday afternoon.

The Diamondvision scoreboard at Three Rivers Stadium served as the looking glass, as they
performed in Pittsburgh Pirates uniforms on the turf below. Lewis went as far as offering advice
to Pirate manager Chuck Tanner ~ “score more runs than the opposition” —— before a sparse
crowd of relatives and friends.

Though the local college all-star team was dumped by the U.S. Olympic team, 10-2, in an
exhibition game before the Pirates-Cubs game, the Pitt players were good losers. to say the least.

“I love it,” Pitt first baseman Tom Horew said. “It‘s been a dream to play in a big league park
since I was little."

“I enjoyed playing at the stadium," lefthander Rich Gavran said. “I was really pumped up."

“It was very exciting," said Phil Palandro, an outfielder. “I felt great.”

Despite the excitement, the Pitt players did not fare so well on the field. Joe Risacher was the
only Panther to get a hit, a single in the ninth inning. Gavran gave up two earned runs in an
inning.

The remainder of the area team came up with seven hits, and scored its two runs in the third
inning.

The U.S. Olympic team simply outmatched them. Their roster lists the finest amateur players
in the country, and includes 15 first-round selections from the recent major league baseball
draft. In addition, the local team only had one organized practice before yesterday’s game.

“Yes, it was disappointing,” Paul Westwood said of his performance, which included three
strikeouts. “We don’t see that kind of pitching in the Federation League.”

“I expect to win every time I go out, even if it’s against the Detroit Tigers," Horew said. “I was
a little disappointed with me results. We outhit them [8-7], but the bottom line was the score.”

The Pittsburgh Area Collegiate All-Stars had a 2-1 lead after three innings, but a four-«run
fourth inning for the Olympic team quenched the area squad.

Two home runs were hit in the game: a three-run shot in the fourth inning by Ben Abner,
whose brother Shawn was selected first in the major league draft, and a solo by Ken Caminiti in
the sixth.

“The two long balls took us out of the game,” Lewis said. “Despite that, all the kids did a fine
job.”

Lewis looked at the game as an exhibition which exposed some of the local talent. “It was a
showcase for the kids and it gave them some competition,” he said. “We didn’t have any lobbers
in there; our kids were throwing the ball har ."

Olympic coach Rod Dedeaux of Southern California was impressed with the talent of the
local all-stars. ‘

“They had a fine club,” he said, “It’s a tribute to those who picked the team. Ifwe didn't have a
couple of home runs, we would have played all day. We have the finest pitching in the country.
That was the difference.”

Wayman was especially impressed with righthander Bobby Witt. The Oklahoma pitcher
fanned five batters in the three innings he pitched.

“He was really throwing heat out there,” Wayman said. “He reared back and challenged the
hitters.”

The U.S. team continues its 40-game schedule, which will culminate at Dodger Stadium for
Olympic competition,,.Iuly 3l-August 7. This is the sixth time baseball has been played as a
demonstration sport in the Olympics.

“I am very pleased with the way we are playing," Dedeaux said. “All we need is enough games
to work on the little things.

“In head—to-head competition, South Korea, Chinese-Taipei, Nicaragua and Japan have
defeated us, but we have in mind winning the gold.”

In the long run, Dedeaux is among many working towards estabishing baseball as a Olympic
sport.

“All points, from the financial to the artistic, have to be a success,” he said. “If you love
baseball, you’ve got to do it.”

Meanwhile, many of the local all-stars would like to have another chance to perform at Three
Rivers Stadium —~ as major leaguers.

“I had a‘ good time," Horew said. “I hope I’m back.”

Kingdom qualifies

By Charlie O'Hara
Senior Editor

Roger Kingdom became the first
Pitt athlete in 28 years to qualify for
the U.S. Olympic track team by ﬁn-
ishing third in the 110-meter high
hurdles at the trials last night in Los
Angeles.

Kingdom, who skipped the colle-
giate outdoor season as a junior to
pursue an Olympic berth, joins Greg
F oster and Tonic Campbell as possi-
bly the finest high hurdlers ever to
represent the U.S. in the Games.

Foster, ranked No. 1 in the world
for two consecutive years, lived up
to his reputation by breaking the
tape in 13.21 seconds.

Campbell, whom Kingdom
defeated at the Pan-American
Games last August, held off Pitt’s
two-time NCAA champion at the
finish by .02 seconds, 13.38-13.36. It
was the second time in two hours
that Kingdom achieved the best time
of his life.

He and Campbell were also
matched in the second semifinal
heat, run yesterday at 4 p.m. PST.
The Southern California graduate
edged the redshirted Panther by .05
seconds, 13.42-13.36.

In Monday morning’s opening
round, Kingdom breezed to a 13.55
victory -—— slow by his standards —
over Houston's Cletus Clark, the top
collegiate competitor.

Prior to the trials, the Pitt junior
said he needed a time of 13.3 or 13.4
to qualify for the team.

“If I make the team, that will
prove that I am a good hurdler,”
Kingdom said. “A lot of times I win,
but I still have doubts. However, if I
win, I don't think any will remain.”

Kingdom will return to Pitts-
burgh to continue training until the
U.S. team meets in July in Los
Angeles.

Arnie Sowell, was the last Pan-

ther to qualify for the Olympic team.

An Excellent Townhome Condo Value

By Joe Zeﬂ
Senior Editor

Clyde Vaughan spent most of the
spring refining his roundball skills at
Fitzgerald Field House, hoping to
improve his stock in the National
Basketball Association draft.

He even passed up a place on the
English Olympic team, claiming the
NBA was more important to him
than was playing for his homeland.
He expected to be picked no later
than the third round.

Yesterday afternoon, the Indiana
Pacers made Clyde Vaughan the
first pick of the sixth round in the
NBA draft.

“First pick of the sixth round?
Oh,” said a sullen Vaughan upon
hearing the news at his home in Mt.
Vernon, N.Y. “I’m a little disap-
pointed right now, and I don’t know
what I am going to do.”

Vaughan, Pitt's all—time leading
scorer, said he would confer with his
agent and parents about his future.

“I know I was supposed to go
higher because all the players who
went before me  I was supposed to
go higher. I don’t know what I am
going to do right now because, [as]
you know, I have the option to go
overseas," Vaughan said.

Indiana head coach George Irvine
said he hopes Vaughan will try out
for the Pacers before exercising
other options.

“We were very surprised that he
slipped down as far as he did. I
watched him play in college, and I
saw him play up in Chicago [at an
NBA camp].”

The Pacers had the worst record
in pro basketball last season with
Clark Kellogg and Herb Williams
manning the forward positions.
Billy Knight, who starred at Pitt,
played at Indiana before moving on
to Kansas City.

“I don’t know anything about
them,” said Vaughan. “I’mjust dis-

I appointed and upset. I thought I'd

go a little bit higher - I thought I’d

‘ go a lot higher, like early in the third

— but maybe it wasn’t meant to be.”
