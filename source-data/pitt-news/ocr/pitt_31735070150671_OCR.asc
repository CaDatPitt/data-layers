MAYORAL ELECTION -

Mayoral candida

tes debate government accountability, crime 7

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pittsburgh mayoral election will not take
place until this November, but candidates are

‘already vying for their right to the position.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s announcement
March 1 that he would not seek reelection
has stoked the expectations of the seven re-

- maining candidates, six of whom took part

in Sunday’s Democratic mayoral debate at

the Barack Obama Academy of International ‘

Studies in East Liberty.

Some 380 attendees — including the -

seventh mayoral candidate, Republicanjosh
Wander — ﬁlled the auditorium to listen to the
candidates for the Democratic nomination:
City Council President Darlene Harris; City
Controller Michael Lamb; City Councilman
Bill Peduto; local communityorganizer A._].
Richardson; former state auditorjack Wagner,
and state Rep. Jake Wheatley, D—Allegheny,
who arrived about 35 minutes after the de-

' bate began.

Students from the school’s Youthand

. Government Club hosted and moderated the
debate, which began at 1:30 p.m. Over the

course of the 75-minute debate, the candidates
discussed issues including governmental cor-
ruption, education and crime.

In light of the current FBI investigation
into city contracts and accounts involving the
Pittsburgh Police Department, all of the candi-
dates offered proposals forcurbing municipal
government corruption and defended their
records as public servants. Harris attested
to her experience in city hall regarding this
matter.

“When you come in a position like [mine],
people want to buy you and give you-money,”

Pat McAteer‘
News Editor

Shawn Brooks, Pitt’s Associate Dean
of Students and Director of Residence
Life, is leaving the main campus after

~ accepting a position at Pitt’s Johnstown

campus. . ~

Brooks will assume his duties at Pitt-
Johnstown on April 1. -

Brooks will take over as Pitt-John-
stown’s Vice President fo_r Student Af-
fairs. In his new role, Brooks will “ad—
minister, monitor, and evaluate Student
Affairs programs [and] formulate and
implement student policies,” according‘

to a press release from Pitt—]ohnstown’s~

Office of Public Relations and Commu-
nications.

Harris said. “I have never-been bought.”
Lamb said that'Open Book Pittsburgh, a
program he created as controller, which in-

, cludes an online database of city contracts

and tracks campaign contributions that candi-
dates for city offices receive, showed his com-
mitmentto transparency in government. He
alsomentioned that he’d like to hire civilians
to ﬁll administrative positions in the police
department. -

“I think civilians should be doing our pa-
perwork, and police should be protecting us,”
he said. I '

Peduto said his own experience on the

City Council showed his commitment to ac- _
countability. As an example, he pointed out his

assistance in blocking the appointment of a
public safety director who he said possessed
no qualiﬁcations.

Wagnerrepeatedly cited his experience in .

state government to demonstrate his plans to
improve government accountability. He said

that ﬁve years ago his office conducted an

audit of the Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency, whicheffectively “changed
the -direction” of the‘ agency.

Wheatley, who had arrived by this point ».

in the debate, said that he wanted to improve
monitoring programs for city government.

. Richardson, who said that he has more
than 10 years of experience as community
organizer, emphasized teamwork between
different officials as a means of improving
government accountability. He highlighted the
connection between the mayors and individual
neighborhoods as important to other policies
such as education and crime.

Pittsburgh, he said, is foremost “a city of
the working man,” where the mayor‘ should
empower communities to police their own in-

Pitt-Johnstown ‘President Jem Spec-
tar lauded Brooks’ record in various ad-
ministrative positions at Pitt, the'Uni-
versity of California—Los Angeles, St.
Lawrence University, and the Georgia
Institute ‘of Technology.

“[Brooks] brings an impressive re-
cord of fostering and achieving stu-
dent—life outcomes including retention,
student satisfaction and campus and
civic engagement,” Spectar said in the
press release. A _

Brooks has served as Pitt’s director
of Residence Life since 2008. According
to the Residence ’_Life Office’s website,
the office’s *mission'is “provid[ing] an
educationally stimulating and purpose-
ful community for residence-hall stu-
dents at the University of Pittsburgh.”

' stead of spending money on overtime wages in H
- order to put more police officers on the street.

In addition to the police department’s
internal issues, the candidates also offered
varying proposals to address crime and gun
violence in the city. . -

~ Whileposingarelated question, one ofthe '

students pointed out that Lamb declared a city
ordinance requiring gun owners to reportlost
and stolen weapons “unenforceable.”

- Wagner said that he would put this law ,

into effect. He also pointed out that when he
was City Council president in Pittsburgh, the

city became the ﬁrst in Pennsylvania to pass

a ban on assault weapons.

“If that legislation were still in place three
or four years ago, oflicers might not have been
l<illed,”he said, referring to a 2009 incidentin
Pittsburgh’s Stanton Heights neighborhood,
where three police officers were killed in a
shootout that involved the use‘ of an AK—47,

among other weapons. Harris pointed out that _

as the councilwoman for District 1, an area that
includes the Northside, she set aside money
in order to install security cameras, which

' assisted in solving the murder of a ﬁreﬁghter.
.. .Peduto_advocated for a decentralized po-_e
lice force that .could understand each neigh- .

borhood’s needs, and Lamb called for more
diversity in the police department.

Keeping with the setting of the debate,
much of what the candidates said focused on
education and youth in the city’s communities.

Wagner repeatedly emphasized employ-

» ment programs for young people to address
the “unacceptable” 40-percent dropout rate’

for the city’s 9th through 12th grade students.
He believes that such programs would also

» impact crime by keeping youth occupied and_
would help economic growth by preparing

Brooks’s ‘new position at Pitt—_]ohn-
stown is similar to ,-that of Pitt Dean of
Students Kathy Humphrey’s on Pitt’s
Oakland campus. In an email, Hum-
phrey said that her and Brooks have
collaborated in the past to prepare him
for his eventual career transition into
student affairs. \

“A few years ago, Dr. Brooks shared
with me his aspiration to become a chief
Student Affairs officer, and, together,
we have worked to ensure that he would
be more than prepared to take that next
professional step,” she said.

Humphrey added that the University
would conduct a search to find Brooks’s
replacement, but no other speciﬁcs‘
could be provided regarding the job-
search. I

students for universities and the work force.
Lamb said he believes that programs for

youth during the summer would address the .

gap in the dropout rate between students from
high- and low-income households, two-thirds
of which, he said, comes from the dispar-
ity between their abilities to access summer
programs. ,

Lamb also said that increasing wages for

workers at nonproﬁt organizations such as .

UPMC, which have replaced manufacturing
as the area’s largest employer, would gener-
ate more revenue for the city’s schools. An
increase in wages, he explained, would lead
to an increase in payroll tax revenue, making
more money available for use in the school
district. Lamb advocated for unionization for
UPMC and other nonproﬁt workers to raise
substandard wages. - 

Wagner argued fbr a similar source of edu-
cation ﬁinding. - o .

“We have to get more out of the nonproﬁts,

‘either legally orby convincing them that they

have to give more,” he said.

Peduto said students begin performing '

poorly early on in/their education and that
he wants to improve programs at the lower
grade levels in order to provide each student
wi_ “an equal start-out of the gate,”

L Harris also stressed_the importance of the
relationship between the mayor and the city’s
schools. She said she would lobbyactively at
the state level in order to meet the needs of
Pittsburgh’s schools. .

Wayne Walters, the principal of the Barack
Obama Academy of International Studies,
said he believed the-three students posing‘
questions to the candidates and the student

who moderated the debate did extremely well.

“I’m very proud of my students,” he said.

CANDID REFLECTION

  Can’t solve the federal debt problem

Without addressin

Daniel Okwaisie
Columnist

Warren Buffetlhas a habit of
making casual statements that

"become fascinating quotes. In

late 2012, the 82-year-old Or-
acle of Omaha crafted another
one that every student ought
to-hear, posting on his Twitter
account: “If you buy things you
don’t need, soon you will have
to sell things you do need.”

As insightful as it seems,
Buffet.’s advice represents a
lone voice of frugality in a con-
sumerist culture that has been
propped up with the scholarli-
nessgof economic theory. We are
told not only to buy for our per-
sonal satisfaction, but also to
raise everyone else’s standard
of living. Unsurpisingly, this
cultural attitude has been very
damaging to today’s economy.

The consumerist creed be-
came_ prominent during the
Great Depression when Brit-
ish economist John ‘ Maynard
Keynes popularized the “para-
dox of thrift” theory. The basic
concept behind this theory is
that as people spend more, their
expenses become income - for

the businesses they patronize."

When individu-als spend more,
companies’make money, invest
more in capital and hire more
people, who, in turn getmore
income to spend. If people start

saving, it constitutes. a leakage»

in this cycle. Saving is therefore

a paradox because, although

it is personally good to save, if
everyone does it, there will ‘be
little spending to encourage
and maintain economic growth.

The paradox of thrift be-
came a more integral part of
economic policy in the 19505
when businesses tried to rush
the cycle by granting consum-
ers credit, allowing them to
spend their ‘paychecks before

they earned them. This was the

birth of consumer debt '— and
it allowed economic growth to

  

continue ‘even when customers
had no cash on hand. Financ-
ing inventions like credit cards
enabled the economy to bypass
that income phase of the cycle.
But here is perhaps where
this thrift theory devolves into
what some economists in recent
years have‘ rechristened the
“paradox of debt.” Debt isn’t

_free, and if that expected in-

come does not eventually come,
it is impossible to pay borrowed
money with borrowed money
ad inﬁnitum. The more people

go into debt, ‘the more likely‘

The federal

bullet for

-successive

generations

refusing to

they. will not be able to pay it

back, bringing the economy to
the stand_still_that ‘debt, itself,

V s was supposed to prevent.

‘ ‘ , A lot has been said about the
federal government racking up
debt of about $15 trillion over
the last 30 years. What is sel-
dom mentioned is that, in about
the same period of time, U.S.
households have dis-saved or»
built up debt to more than twice
that amount. Private debt is now
at $38 trillion. The link between
these two debts is essentially
big government. Since private
debt poses a more looming and
swift threat to the economy, the

private debt

arm of government — through
programs like Medicare, Social
Security and policies sympa-
thetic to over—leveraging —— has
been forced to substitute this
private burden with a public one
to keep the economy intact. The
federal debt is largely a result of
the government taking the bul-
let for successive generations

.not only refusing to save, but

choosing to actively dis-save.
-If government didn’t play

this role, today’s economy.

might be in far worse shape.
The government’s action dur-
ing the 2008 recession is a per-
fect example. People borrowed
money to buy houses they knew

they couldn’t afford, hoping’

their values would always be
«above the amount borrowed.
Rogue banks were all too glad to
aid themin this endeavor. When
housing prices abruptly fell, the
government had to relieve both
private » parties of that debt.
Through the Federal Reserve’s
quantitative easing programs,
the government‘ continues to
relieve about $40 billion dollars _
per month of commercial hous-
ing market debt risk, much to
the angst of Ron Paul followers.
Of course not all borrowing is
bad, and much federal debt isn’t
a result of systematically bail-
ing out banks. Much of today’s
debt, and future debt, comes
from entitlements, which ex-
ist because of increasing levels
of private debt. While I am not

against the idea of government
performing. it’s stated task of

ensuring general welfare, how
long can the government con-
tinue to fund these programs
while people refuse to save
and instead borrow more than
they earn? How long can this
be sustained? Instead of point-

ing fingers at the government,

perhaps the’ real culprits are in
the mirrors of most American
households. I

ONE-AND-DONE

Syracuse uses 3—pointlers‘to clown Pitt inquarterﬁnals

Jasper Wilson
 Assistant News Editor

NEW YORK — The shot hit the rim and
bounced up, ﬂoating in the air and graz-
ing the backboard before falling down-
ward into the hoop. .

C.J. Fair’s contested buzzer—beating
3-pointer to end the ﬁrst halfwas one of
12 Syracuse made from beyond the arc
Thursday afternoon, and that volume
proved to be the difference as the Or-
ange withstood a late Pitt charge to win
their Big East men’s basketball quarter-
ﬁnal matchup at Madison Square Gar-
den, 62-59. '

The nature of that one play summed
up Pitt’s game: death by the 3-pointer.

Syracuse’s 12 3—pointers are the most ,

triples the Panthers have allowed in a

_.single game this season and the most
made by the Orange. Syracuse advances

to play Georgetown on Friday.
Syracuse senior forward James
Southerland didn’t play against Pitt

when the two teams=met a month ago

at the Petersen Events Center because
of an academic suspension, but he went
off against the Panthers when he got the
chance", converting all six of his 3-point
attempts -— a Big East tournament re-
cord for makes without a miss beyond
the arc. . _ =

Southerland, who ﬁnished with a
game-high 20 points, credited Pitt with
attempting to make his success as diffi-
cult as possible — not that it mattered.

“They did_a great job of staying with
me. Even when I was moving, they did
a good job of trying to be physical,” he
said. . _

That shooter’s mode rendered him
unconscious.

“It’s a great feeling,” he said of his

inability to miss. “I don’t even think
about it-. Ijust go out and make sure I
make every shot.”

Stating one’s intentions of making
every shot would usually qualify as hy-
perbole if not delusion, but unfortu-
nately for Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
and the Panthers, not on Thursday.

“Our transition defense wasn’t good
in_ the first half, and that’s how he got
open looks. When he got matched up
on different guys, our five was guarding
him on the one play.” _

On offensein the firsthalf, Pitt (24-
8, 12-6 Big East) oftentimes couldn’t
crack the Orange’s 2-3 zone and -spent
portions of the game beyond the arc,
rotating the ball around while looking

..for an opening, appearing to. achieve

nothing.

The pro—Orange crowd erupted after
every successful three, turning Madi-
son Square Garden into a virtual away
venue early on despite the“arena’s ofﬁ-
cial status as a neutral site.

“Simply put, the first half we didn’t
play our defense. That dug the hole for
us,” Dixon said.

“Obviously we did much better in
the second half and put us in a posi-
tion to win,” Dixon said. “The problem
is you’ve got to play that way for two
halves, and_we»didn’t do that.”

The Orange (25—8, 11-7 Big East) ﬁn-
ished the ﬁrst portion having connect-
ed on a greater percentage of threes
than overall (62 to 53 percent) and re-
peated that pattern after the break.

Whenever Pitt was within striking
distance_once play resumed, Syracuse
fended off the attempt. . ' '

Midway through the second half,
redshirt senior Tray Woodall narrowed
the difference to four with a 3-pointer,

C.J. Fair's lengthy 3-pointer at the end of the first half ended up being the difference
between the two teams at Madison Square Garden.«Bobby Mizia | Assistantvisual Editor

only to have sophomore point guard
Michael Carter—Williams answer with a
three of his own on the following pos-
session. That was the nature of the con-
test.

- “We had to have a tremendous shoot-
ing day today to beat them, and it’s usu-
ally hard —to shoot well against them,”
Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim said.

Woodall finished with 12 points, and
redshirt junior Lamar Patterson paced
Pitt with 14.

Pitt got as close as four points three

times the rest of the game before man-
aging to get within a single possession
after Woodall converted an and one
with 1:15 remaining. Talib Zanna made
a layup and got fouled with 31 seconds
left to leave Pitt trailing by a mere point.
But he missed the free throw, and
Carter—Will.iams added four of his own
before time expired to ensure his team’s
advancement to the -next round.
Patterson made a layup at the buzz-
er, but the margin at that point was ﬁve,
and thus, his ﬁnal contribution meant
nothing. . J
,“We had time, and obviously we did.
We had an opportunity to come back

.and do it right,” Dixon said.

That effort fell short.
Pitt closing the gap and almost get-
ting the win made it clear to Woodall

what_the team can achieve when it plays,"

to its capabilities. Now the difficulty
going forward as the single-elimination
NCAA tournament has arrived "is doing
so before _its too late. ,

“This ‘game in the second half
showed what kind of team we really are.
We played outstanding basketball in the
second half,” he said.’ “I just. hope from
here we’re building on what we did in
the second half and erase what we did
in the first.” if

Pitt bids farewell to

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

NEW YORK -— Saying goodbye is never
easy.

But it’s especially hard when the
ending could’ve been so much different.

That was the case for the Pitt men’s
basketball team Thursday afternoon as
it disappointingly bowed out of the ﬁ—,
nal Big East tournament before its tran-
sition to the Atlantic Coast Conference
next season, losing to Syracuse 62-59 in
a dramatic contest at Madison Square
Garden. ~

In a manner ﬁtting of the many great

‘ Big East tournament games over the

years, the Panthers stormed back from
a 13-point halftime deﬁcit to change the
dynamic of what had been a one-sided
battle in Syracuse’s favor. =

With 32 seconds remaining, Talib
Zanna stood on the free-throw line with
a chance to tie the game and potentially
send it to overtime.

But Zanna’s foul shot rolled off the
rim, Syracuse gathered the rebound,
and the Orange converted all of their
free throws to win’the matchup between
the two future ACC schools. ,

the overwhelming sentiment of missed
opportunity.

Madison Square Garden has become too
familiar for Pitt fans. '
The building that housed so many
incredible memories transformed into
a house of horrors in recent years.
After winning the Big East champi-
onship game in 2008, Pitt won just one
more at the fabled conference tourna-

Big East with tough loss  

ment: a ﬁrst-round victory overNo. 12
seed St. John’s in 2012.»

That stat seems inexplicable, con-
sidering the Panthers advanced to the
tournament ﬁnal in seven of the previ-
ous eight years. But such is the unfor-
giving nature of Big East basketball.

Sure, future ACC tournaments for
Pitt and its fans will be both fun and ‘ex-
citing. New memories will be created;
new heroes will be made.

But it’ll never be the same as the Big
East tournament.

The surprise run Brandin Knight and
the Panthers made to the 2001 Big East
championship game, which sparked the
program’s recent success; the double
overtime defeat to Connecticut in the
2002' ﬁnal; the‘ dominating perfor-

"mance against the Huskies to win the

2003 title and the stunning four-wins-
in—four—days 2008 triumph led by Sam
Young won’t be forgotten anytime soon.

“The Big East has made our program,
and we’ve had great runs in this tour-
nament,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said, stating the obvious after his team
played its ﬁnal game in the Big East. “It
just didn’t happen this year.”

Pitt receives No.8 seed in

Nate Barnes

.

The Pitt men’s basketball team finally
knows where it’s going for its return to
2 the NCAA tournament. «

The Panthers earned a No. 8 seed
in the West Region and will face No. 9
seed Wichita State on Thursday in Salt
Lake City at a to-be-determined time.
Pitt landed a No. 8 seed after finishing
24-8 (1_2-6 Big East) and losing in its only

game at the Big East tournament against
Syracuse. ' ‘ 8 _ V

The No. 8 seed is lower than many
bracketologists and speculators expected
Pitt to receive from the NCAA tournament
selection committee, with most expecting
a No. 6 seed to come Pitt’s way. But Pitt --
likely because of a weak nonconference
schedule and head—to-head losses against
many of the other eight Big East teams to
qualify for the Big Dance —— saw its stock .
fall in the eyes of the committee. ‘

But t,he'Panthers can’t dwell on their
surprising seed, and they will needto be
at their best to beat Missouri,Va1ley Con—.
ference foe Wichita State in the second;
roundlcontest.

Should Pittadvance past'the Shock-
ers, the rest of the West bracket features.
Western Athletic Conference champion
Gonzaga as the No. 1 seed —— a potential
third-round opponent for Pitt — and Big

Ten tournament champion Ohio State as

the No. 2 seed. . ‘

West, will play Wichita State  

Pitt’s bracket also includes Big Ten’
runner—1'1p Wisconsin, Mountain West
champion New Mexico, SEC tournament
champion Ole Miss, Ivy League cham-
pion Harvard and conference rival Notre
Dame. 8

But the Panthers claimed they weren’t
looking past Wichita State, with head
coach Jamie Dixon already analyzing
the challenges of a showdown with the
Shockers. _

“They run a lot of sets, half—court stuff
and a lot of cross—screens and down-
screens. They change some defenses,”
Dixon said at the Petersen Events Center
on Sunday evening after the bracket was
announced. “I think it’s.mainly man-to-
man, ‘but they’ll throw in some zone.”

Although Pitt likely enters the contest
as a favorite, the Panthers are certainly li-
able to experience an upset by the 26—win

team, which earned big regular—season
victories over fellow NCAA tournament

“We are not overlooking this game,”
Pitt senior point guard Tray Woodall said.
“We want to win, [we] want to go out on

This question ofoverlooking Wichita
State exists because if Pitt defeats the
Shockers, it probably faces a tasty match-

The score stood at 66-64, with the Pitt

men’s basketball team holding a slim lead

over Villanova in the ﬁnal minute of over-

time during its March 3 contest at the Pe-
tersen Events Center.

Afterjames Robinson drained a clutch
3-pointer to force the extra period, Pitt
dominated the early minutes of overtime.
But the Wildcats held all the momentum
after storming back into the game with
a 7-0 run, and the Panthers needed to
make a play. '

Neither freshman guard Robinson nor
senior guard Tray Woodall panicked.

lege — and they’ve made those winning
plays over and over again. So with about
30 seconds left, Woodall drove through a
gap and dished it to his wide—open back-
court mate for another crucial 3—pointer
from the freshman. ‘

Along with the ball, Woodall was also,
in a way, passing the proverbial torch. p

Woodall sometimes calls his own
number in those situations, but he felt
enough confidence in Robinson to make
the pass.

“In the locker room, Tray told me to
drop down once he penetrated,” Rob-
inson» said after the game. “And he pen-

Pitt utilizes redshirt rule,
allowsplayers to improve

L. Jasper Wilson
' Assistant Sports Editor

When watching the Pitt men’s basketball’

team this postseason, take a look at the end
of the Panthers’ bench. _
You will see three players spending the

‘ entire game in warm-ups, cheering on their

teammates: junior walk_—on Aron Nwankwo,
sophomore walk—on Mike Lecak and fresh-
man Chris Jones. _

' But while Nwankwo, Lecak and Jones
are the only Panthers who never see the
ﬂoor this season, ma_ny of their teammates
can sympathize. The three are among eight
players on this year’s roster who are or have
redshirted, a process that allows. student
athletes toparticipate in all team activis

ties except games without using a ‘year of A

eligibility. This means that, at one point or
another, more than half of Pitt’s team has

‘ experienced redshirting.

Cheering on the Panthers from the
stands might be a favorite pastime of many
Pitt fans, but for experienced players, such a
position on the sidelines can be frustrating.
Yet taking a year off from game play while
reserving eligibility can have critical advan-
tages. It’s a tough choice to make, but if the
situation is right, the decision to redshirt
could translate to an important opportunity
for both players and their teams.

The reasons ,

As Pitt’s three 2012-2013 redshirts
prove, the reasons for redshirting vary.

». Each of Pitt’s current redshirts.has a dif-
ferent reason for sticking to the bench dur-
ing games this year. Nwankwo is a pre—med
student and needs an extra year to complete
his neurology coursework; Lecak was forced

REDS!-IIRT ‘

5 ~ to sit out a year after transferring from a

fellow NCAA school, Division II Wheeling
Jesuit University, and Jones redshirted for
developmental purposes. ~ '
4 Sometimes players redshirt because of
injury. Current point guard and redshirt
, senior Tray Woodall, who recently broke the
1,000-point mark for his career and earned
Third Team All-Big East honors this season,
redshirted his freshman year because of
injury, as did redshirt juniors and fellow
starters Lamar Patterson and Talib Zanna.
‘ Other times, players such asJones need

an extra year to develop from high school
and adapt to the college game. Redshirt
freshman Durand Johnson and redshirt
sophomore Cameron Wright also fall into
this category. The transition from high
school to college sports is one that Pitt
head athletic trainer Tony Salesi summed
up by comparing high school sports to an
after-school activity — a categorization
that would fall far short of describing the
scope of commitment many college sports
require. ‘

And sometimes exceptions to the usual
redshirting process occur. Former Pitt star
point guard Carl Krauser didn’t qualify aca-
demically and sat out his freshman year.
And sometimes the choice depends on po-
sitional depth on a team’s roster. Malcolm

Gilbert, for example, the sophomore big‘

man.who has since transferred from Pitt,
didn’t redshirt during his freshman season
because of the abrupt departure of fellow
ﬁrst—year Khem Birch last year. The move
left Pitt with only four players capable of
playing down low and necessitated Gilbert’s
remaining eligible.

The challenge

While the option to have players red-
shirt can have many beneﬁts for a team, the
prospect of sitting out for an e'ntire season’s
worth of games often represents a great
challenge for individual players. Having
experienced for himself the opportunity
to improve that the. extra year provides,
Woodall says he has tried to convey the

necessity of this advantage to players such
as Jones and Wright.

“Since I’ve been here, I’ve always tried to
be patient and wait for my opportunity to

. play and take advantage of the opportuni-

ties that I did have to play,” Woodall said.
“A lot of guys, they don’t want to wait one
year, or one play, or one season.”

For Marcus Bowman (2002-2007); a for-
mer walk—on to the Pitt team who'redshirted
his freshman year, redshirting when able to
is a no brainer. '

“Why waste a year when you can get mul-
tiple years?” Bowman said. “You’re fortu-
nate when you can redshirt guys.”

Bowman now works for the University’s
athleticdepartment as an assistant athletic
director for administration and planning.

Woodall believes thatsometimes coach-
es know that certain players need to red-
shirt in order to reach their ﬁill potential,
especially at Pitt.

“Once you getjhere, you just gotta be
patient because the coaches have a plan
for you,” he said. _

That patience needs to ﬁnd balance with
an equally important personality trait: com-
petitiveness. The desire most high-level

athletes have to succeed doesn’t go away

during the time when they don’t play, ac-
cording to Gilbert Brown, a ﬁve-year player
for the Panthers who graduatedein 2011,
scored more than 1,000 points at Pitt and

_now plays professionally in Turkey.

“It was_ still hard,” he said of redshirting,
which he did his freshman year because of
injuries. “At least for me, I’m a competitor.
And I’m such a competitor that I feel like I
can always go out there and compete and
play and give to the team.”-.

Coaches and players make the decision

to redshirt through mutual consent. That -

said, if a player declines to heed a coach’s
recommendation to redshirt and remains
eligible, he might not end up seeing much
playing time. This could result in, as Bow-
man calls it, a wasted year. Having the men-
tal fortitude to make it through the trying
experience_of sitting out, on the other hand,
could carry over for the rest of a player’s
career. A

Salesi agreed but noted that it’s not a bad
sign when players want to play.

“I’ve never seen any kid completely,
100-percent happy with it,” he said. “I’m
OK with that too because the kids want to
play, so that’s an encouragement as well. If
a kid says ‘Oh OK, that’s ﬁne,’ I don’t think
that’s a good sign that a kid’s competitive.
I think that’s important to some degree.”

Accepting to redshirt can be especially
difficult for players who have just spent
several years dominating at the high school
level. V

“That’s probably thetoughest thing
about the redshirt because even though it
beneﬁts a lot of players, at the same time,
everyone coming to college wants to get out

' there right away and show everybody what

they got,” Nwankwo said. “It frustrates you,
but you have to use that frustration to help
you get better and to use it for next year. It’s

In its ﬁnal regular—season game as a
member of the Big East, the Pitt men’s
basketball team produced a record-
breaking performance in a victory over
DePaul.

The Panthers concluded the 81-66
win by shooting a school— and Big East-
record 72 percent from the ﬁeld, mark—
ing the end of an era in emphatic fash-
ion as Pitt prepares to begin life in the
Atlantic Coast Conference next season.

In honor of Pitt’s 30 memorable years
in the Big East, here’s a list of the best
men’s basketball teams the University
has seen in that time:

the NCAA tournament

Nate Barnes
Senior Suﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

Pitt men’s basketball aficionados all
maintain awareness of Pitt’s disappoint-
ing 2011-2012 season, which saw the Pan-

thers finish without an invitation to the

NCAA tournament for the first time in
Jamie Dixon’s tenure as head coach. The
Panthers finished 22-17 overall, with a
5-13 mark in Big East play — their worst

V mark since going 5-13 in the 1998-1999

season.

Roughly a year later, Pitt is primed for
March Madness as opposed to preparing
for the College Basketball Invitational it
participated in —— and won —~ last season.
Pitt ﬁnished its regular season worlds
apart from its previous campaign, with
a 24-8 overall record and a 12-6 mark in
the Big East — good enough to land Pitt
a No. 8 seed in -the West Region of the
NCAA tournament.

g“Last year we weren’t able to make it
and we’re usually a team that does,” se-

nior. forwardfpante Taylor» said on Sunday

afte'f“the‘team learned its‘ NCAA tourna-
ment fate. “We’re just happy that we get
the opportunity to go out there and play
and prove ourselves.” I .

Fellow senior Tray Woodall felt that
"the team’s work ethic during the offsea—
son also played a big role in the Panthers
returning to the Big Dance after last sea-
son’s surprising absence.

“Since Day One, since the summer
time, guys worked, they putthe work
in,” Woodall said. “And this is the result,
being in the NCAA Tournament.”

_ Fans will remember this basketball
season as a bounce—back year for.Pitt, a
recovery much-needed as’ the program

V played its last season in the Big East ahead

of a move tothe Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence. - «

But just how did’Pittmanage to ascend _‘

from the depths of the CBI and "reclaim
its spot in March’s real Madness? I

The answer is simple: defense and
rebounding.

For each game, Dixon made‘-it clear
that his goals were to hold the opposition
under 40—percent‘shooting from the ﬁeld
and to out-rebound them significantly.

Anyone who’s spent any time around
basketball, or any organized sport for

that matter, has heard the adage “defense .

wins championships.” While Pitt didn’t
win a championship this season (yet?),
the Panth.ers'made an incredible turn-
around on the defensive end to propel
themselves to 24' regular-season wins.
Last season, Pitt’s opponents scored

' 65.5 points per game against the Pan-

thers. The total served as the worst since

the aforementioned dismal 1998-1999

season. 5

But this year, Pitt improved its de-
fensive total by more than 10 points, al-
lowing only 55.4 points per game to its
opposition.

And while Pitt held its opposition to
a low average point total, the Panthers
more importantly achieved the goal that
Dixon set for his defense. On average,
Pitt restricted opponents to a ﬁeld‘-goal
percentage 0f39.3 percent shooting over
the course of the season.

“There’s a lot of things I think because
our change, our improvement is pretty
dramatic so I don’t think you can put it
on one thing. Guarding ball screens we’re
a little better at, we did a couple things
different scheme-wise,” Dixon said of
why his defense has improved.

If Pitt’s season ended today, the av-
erage wo.uld_ serve as a school record,
surpassing the 56.4 points allowed per
game by the 2003-2004 squad featuring
Dixon in his first year at the helm.

Coincidentally —- or not so much at
all — that squad won 31 games and ad-
vanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA
Tournament. ’ r

This year, Pitt’s No. 6—ranked scoring

defense is likely its largest asset to help ‘
the Panthers make a run deep in the Big

Dance. 4

On the otherside of the defensive coin
is rebounding, which forms the second
half of the duo whose importance Dixon
stressed’ incessantly over the course of
the season. I " '

In its 32 games thus far,_ Pitt won the
rebounding battle 23 times. At face value,
that holds a pretty strong correlation
to the Panthers winning 24 of those 32

games. -

For the season as a whole,'Pitt ended
with a rebounding average of 35.3 re-

bounds per game. Pitt’s rebounding total
- doesn’t turn heads across the nation and

is relatively average compared to Divi-
sion I competition, with a ranking of 140
among all teams.

_But the true value in~Pitt’s rebounding

statistics this season lies in the way Pitt‘

asserted itself on the glass in roughly
three—fourths of its games. Nothing capi-
talizes Pitt’s rebounding dominance more
than its average rebounding margin, as
the Panthers ‘out-rebounded their opposi-
tion by an average of 7.1 boards per game.

With Dixon’s emphasis on defense and
rebounding validated’, the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team has returned to the NCAA
tournament. I

REDS!-IIRT

E’ rtough mentally, but if you’re_mentally tough,

you can use to your advantage.”

The results

Despite the challenge it can present,

the concept of redshirting exists to allow
players to grow and improve, a process that

" "lhas helped the Pitt men’s basketball team

,co_nsiste'ntly compete for championships in
the past decade despite struggling to keep
up with the Connecticuts,‘ Kentuckys and
Dukes of the college basketball world in
regard torecruiting. Pitt has utilized the act

(a

of redshirting for several years, with quality
players such as Krauser,’Chevon Troutman
and Jaron Brown all using_the year off to
improve their games .before later becoming
starters for the Panthers.

“I’ve rarely seen anyone redshirt not
beneﬁt from-thafdown the road,” Salesi
said. _ t V -

Nwankwo knows that the experience
of sitting on the sidelines isn’t fun, but he
feels how one reacts to that situation is
imperative. ' . ' . ,

“You need to have a,.pos_itive attitude

a about it,” he said. “Youhave to embrace it.”

Embracing it helps aplayer develop emo-
tionally, Brown pointedfout.

“You learn so much about yourself and

ﬁgure out what you can do as a basketball

player within the system,” Brown said.
“Having that year ofl" to learn it and practice
it with the guys really helps you and gives
you an extra advantage going into the next
season because you have four more years
to excel, and you already have a year in the
program.” '

In addition to lifting and workout ses-
sions and cheering on their teammates,
one outlet for the energy of those stuck on
the sidelines is practice, where redshirts
frequently mix in on the scout team and
help their teammates prepare for the next
opponent.

‘ .“It’s ﬁin, ’cause every practice before a
game the scout team will press the other
team. It’s just fun because we get to play
more free and don’t have to worry about

playing within our system. We can play hard
on ‘D’ and, once we get the ball, just go at
_the other team. So it’s less restraining than
regular practice,” Nwankwo said. “They
keep the foul calls minimal to try to get the
team ready for what the other team’s gonna
do, so it’s just fun bringing it, especially
when we’re getting steals and winning.”
Salesi, who has worked at his alma mater
since 1986, aims to help players through
the period during which they are a part of
the team but remain on the outside look-
ing in. Thus, he and his staff play a role in
maintaining spirits and working with the
players. ‘ _ '
“I think it’s just like the coaches. [The
players] are in college — you have to edu-
cate them. If I have [a player with] an injury,
‘I educate the student—athlete on what the
problem is, what the expectations are, etc.,
with regard to the rehab, the outcomes 
where they need to_be today and where they
need to be going down the line,” he said.
“Sometimes I’ll have to tell them, ‘You’re
two months out from an injury. Look at
where you were six weeks ago, you’ve made
a lot of progress. Six weeks from now, we’re
gonna make a lot more progress.’ That has
to be a constant ﬁlter for them.”
Bowman said that, to players who were
.the best in high school, the prospect of not
playing for an entire season can come as a
shock, but it’s not something that usually

. holds'Panthers back for long.

“You have _to be strong. It takes a little
bit of humility,” he said. “It takes a little bit
of a special person, but that’s what makes

us special here at- Pitt — that we have those

people.” I

For a men’s basketball program with
several players from the New York area,
the Big East tournament at the so-called
“World’s Most Famous Arena” was as
good as it got. Every player who signs
for a‘B,ig‘East school dreams of lifting
the conference-tournament trophy on
the Madison Square Garden ﬂoor.

Woodall told me last week with cer-
tainty that he believes the Big East tour-

. nament is tougher to winthana nation- '
val championship.

If true, this statement bodes , well
for Pitt’s hopes at making a run in the
NCAA" tournament, which starts’ this
week, but even the most optimistic Pan-
ther fan would admit that winning a na-

tional championship -is a long shot for '

this year’s good—but-not—great team.
But as the Panthers’ second-half run

proved once again, hope springs eternal _

for unpredictable Pitt. ,

“We’ll dwell on ’[the loss] for a few
hours tonight, and then we have to
moveon,” Woodall said. " A

However, moving on fromsuch a tre-
mendous basketball conference could
prove difficult for Pitt players and -fans
alike. 3 .

Pitt suffers another winless season in conference play

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff W riter

Following a 2011-2012 season in which the
Pitt women’s basketball team failed to win
any of its 16 Big East games, the phrase
“break the streak” followed the 2012-2013

Panthers squad throughout conference

play.
Those —three words could be found all
over Twitter, used by Pitt fans to cheer on

the team when Pitt appeared to be on the

verge of picking up a conference victory
—- even trending as a popular phrase on
Twitter in the city of Pittsburgh on several
occasions. ’ _

But the Panthers couldn’t break their
losing streak, suffering a second—straight
winless season in conference play.

Pitt did earn several wins at the begin-
ning of the season, albeit against much
weaker nonconference opponents. They
were wins the team and program desper-
ately needed. The Panthers won six of their
ﬁrst seven contests, ripping off ﬁve home
wins in a row from Nov. 11 to Nov. 26. The
ﬁve-game streak was the high point in an-
other down season for Pitt, but individual
accolades highlighted the Panthers’-play
throughout the campaign.

Junior forward Asia Logan returned -

from a shoulder injury that sidelined

her for much of the previous seasonand
set a new Petersen Events Center record
for points scored in a single game with a
36-point effort in a 76-74 victory over Wil-
liam 8: Mary on Nov. 11.

Sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel was
night-in and night—out the Panthers’ best
player — often referred to by head coach
Agnus Berenato as her “coach on the
court.” Kiesel ﬁnished third and ninth in
the Big East in minutes played and scor-
ing, respectively, averaging a whopping
36.5 minutes per night and 14.9 points per
game. - -

On Dec. 20, Berenato became the all-
time winningest head coach in Pitt wom-
en’s basketball‘ history with a 67-49 win
over her very own alma mater, Mount St.
Mary’s. While picking up ‘her’159th vic-
tory and passing former coach Kirk Bruce,
Berenato remained modest and unfocused
on the record. ‘

“I’m not really into records,” Berenato

‘ said after the record—breaking game. “I

never have been. _I couldn’t tell . you how
many wins it is. I think I’ve been here a little
bit longer than other people. I’m»-just proud
to work at the University of Pittsburgh and
represent the city of Pittsburgh.” ‘

kicked it to me. I think it was a trust thing
[between us]. He knew I was going to hit
it.” - . ‘

Woodall isn’t the only one with trust in
Robinson. Many Pitt fans feel as though
the freshman’s performances have prov-
en that when Woodall graduates after

9 this season, Robinson is ready to become

the next in a long line of great Panther
point guards.

Conﬁdence

-Ever since the Ben Howland era began
in 1999, there’s been a certain conﬁdence
belonging to Pitt’s point guards. Most of
them hailed from the New York area ‘and
epitomized the swagger of the Big Apple.

It started with Brandin Knight. Then
Carl Krauser took over. The gutsy Lev-
ance Fields then led Pitt to the Elite Eight

. .1-_while mentoring Woodall.

Woodall typiﬁes what a Pitt point
guard should be: tough, gutsy and suc-
cessful. He’s the player who wants the
ball at the end of games, _securing multi-
ple clutch shots over his career. Woodall
speaks highly of his predecessors and is
just «happy to be mentioned in the same
breath as them. ‘

“It’s an honor to be mentioned with
those names, the guys who paved the way
for point guards at Pitt,” Woodall said.

March 18, 2013 I The Pitt News l v\/\/wv.pltiﬂevvs.com

Woodall has taken on the ‘same con-
fidence as his formers, never shy to take
the big shot.-A couple of years ago, a re-
porter asked Woodall what gives him
his conﬁdence and why he makes so
many big shots’. He simply responded,
“scared money don’t make no money.”
And Woodall isn’t scared because of the
countless hours he spends in the gym.
When‘ he first came to Pitt, Woodall was
only anaverage shooter. Now lie’s argu-
ably Pitt’s best, a testament to his work
ethic. - '

The same goes for Robinson, his con-
fidence being a product of his work eth-
ic. Mike Jones, Robinson’s high school
coach at DeMatha Catholic said some
think Robinson works too hard, yet he
still ﬁnds it necessary to put in the extra
hours. '

“I have always known James to be a
gym rat,” Jones said. “He is one kid that
some think works too hard. Many times
you want him to give his bodyla break.”

Inutypical fashion of a point guard,‘

however, Robinson. and Woodall also de-
fer to’ others when discussing their con-
fidence. Both have confidence in and are
calmed by their teammates and coaches.
“Knowing I have a lot of great players
around me, I think that. helps everybody
else be' calm on the. court,” Robinson
said. “Knowing you have four players on
the court helping you out, and you have

surprisingly successful campaign.

The team ﬁnished the season with a
29-8 recordafter losing to former coach
Ben Howland_’s UCLA team, 64-55, in the
NCAA tournament.

4. 1981-1988: Winning .with
style ' ‘

In Paul Evans’s second season as-head
coach, ‘the news_ of Pitt basketball’s as-
cension refused to be conﬁned to Oak-
land. The team’s entrance into national
relevancy can be summarized in four
words: “Send it in, Jerome!”

On Jan. 25, 1988, during a nation-
ally televised game against Providence
at the Fitzgerald Field House, Pitt for;
ward Jerome Lane received a pass from
point guard Sean Miller and went up for
a dunk over a Providence player. As he
slammed the ball down, the backboard’s
glass shattered, causing ESPN announc=
er Bill Raftery to famously exclaim:
“Send it in, Jerome!” , .

The play instantly became an iconic
moment in Pitt sports history.-But those

4 who’ve only seen the highlight might not

know that the team playing behind Lane
was quite good, too.

Lane, Miller and forward Charles
Smith led an upstart Pitt team that
earned a No. 2 national ranking during
the season. After winning the program’s
;second—‘strai_ght‘Big East regular—season
championship, the team lost in the sec-
ond round of the conference tourna-
ment to Villanova and the second round
of the NCAA tournamentto Vanderbilt,
ﬁnishing the season with a 24-7 mark.

3. 2002-2003: ‘Howland gets

his trophy _ -
Very ‘few, if any, Pitt fans thought

the 2002-2003 men’s basketball season

would be Coach Howland’s last at the -

University. After taking over in 1999,
Howland guided the team to its first
NCAA tournament appearance since
1993 in 2002. And before leaving Pitt
to ‘take the head coaching position at
UCLA, Howland left the Petersen Events
Center’s trophy cabinet a little more

' crowded.

In another season in which Pitt
reached No. 2 in the national rankings,
Howland, along‘ with point guard Bran-
din Knight and shooting guard Julius
Page, led Pittto its first Big East Tourna-
ment championship, do’minating Con-
necticut in the ﬁnal, 74-56. _

Pitt cruised through the first two

rounds of the NCAA tournament in
Howland’s ﬁnal run with the team and
appeared on its way to the Final Four.

But Cinderella squad Marquette,
led by current Miami Heat superstar
Dwyane Wade, upset the Panthers in
the Sweet 16. The game also marked
Knight’s ﬁnal college basketball game
and ushered in the Jamie Dixon era at
Pitt. P ‘

2. 2010-2011: What could have
been 1
Two seasons.ago, Pitt suffered one of

_ the most heartbreaking season endings

in the team’s history.

With 2.2 seconds remaining in a sec-
ond-round game of the,NCAA tourna-
ment, Butler led Pitt 69-68. But as Pitt
forward Gilbert Brown launched a des-
peration shot, he was fouled by Butler
guard Shelton Mack, sending Brown to
the free—throw line. Brown missed the

. second shot of the one—and.—one, leaving

the contest tied. After the ball clanged
off the rim, Pitt forward Nasir Robinson

shockingly fouled Butler’s Matt Howard ‘

with less .than one sec_ond remaining.
Howard hit both free throws, ending‘
Pitt’s tournament run prematurely.

Despite its. untimely exit from the
March Madness tournament, this Pitt
team should be remembered for its
depth and incredible regular season.
The Panthers ﬁnished the year with a
24-6 record and earned a No. 1 seed in»
the NCAA tournament.

I. 2008-2009: Finally No. I
The 2008-2009 Pitt men’s basketball

team was the most talented in the his-

tory of the prog-ram.

Led by point guard Levance.Fields,
forward Sam Young andvcenter DeJuan
Blair, the Panthers reached No. 1 in the
national rankings for the ﬁrst time in.
program history.  ‘

But even they weren’t immune to the
madness of March. . _

With the score tied-in the ﬁnal second
of an Elite Eight battle, Villanova guard
Scottie Reynolds dashed the length of
the court, ﬁnishing with a lob into the
hoop over Gilbert Brown, sending Villa-
nova to the Final_Four for the ﬁrst time

‘ since 1985.

Although fans cringe when they think
of how Pitt missed out onits first Final
Four since'1941,‘ they can still reminisce
about the team’s dominance. Finishing
31-5, the team managed to defeat _Con-
necticut twice when the Huskies were .
ranked No. 1 in the country. The Pan-
thers also earned the program’s ﬁrst-
ever No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.

Kiesel also expressed her excitement

' at being a part of Pitt women’s basketball

history.

“We worked really, really hard,” she
said. “Getting Coach B. this win is just joy-
ful going into the holidays. It’s good and it
makes us feel excited.” |

The Mount St. Mary’s win moved the
Panthers to 7-4 on the season. Victories
over Buffalo and Old Dominion followed,
and Pitt headed into its ﬁnal season of
conference play in the Big East full of con-
ﬁdence.

Little did the Panthers know that when

the ﬁnal buzzer sounded on Jan. 2 in Nor-
folk, Va., resulting in the 55-54 win over
Old Dominion, that it would be their ﬁnal
victory this season.

Several heavy defeats at the beginning
of Big East play dropped Pitt’s overall re-
cord below .500 and resulted in the team’s

conference losing streak extending to al— ‘ )

most 30 games.

The ﬁrst true close game for Pitt in Big
East play came seven games into the con-
ference schedule when the Panthers trav-

eled to DePaul for a Tuesday—night battle.-

After trading chances and lead changes in
the ﬁnal minutes, DePaul sophomore star
Brittany Hrynko sent the Panthers pack-
ing with less than ﬁve seconds to go as
her jump shot earned a 57-55 win for the

Blue Demons, leaving Pitt still looking for
its ﬁrst regular-season conference victory
since Feb. 15, 2011.

Entering a Feb. 6 bout with the strug-
gling Providence Friars at the Petersen
Events Center, the team held’ high hopes
that it could break the streak.

But despite a thrilling double—overtime
effort, the Panthers’ bid to stop the streak
at 29 games felljust short in a 85-83 loss.

As Feb. 23 rolled around, the Panthers
had another chance to earn a conference
Victory in front of the home fans at the
sixth—annual ‘Pink the Petersen’ event,
which raises money each year for breast
cancer research and awareness.

After overcoming a 12-point second--

half deﬁcit, Pitt tied the score at 70 with

just 20 seconds remaining. After George-
town missed a shot, the referees called a
loose—ba1l foul on the Panthers with 0.7
seconds to play. Junior guard Andrea White
sank both free throws to lift the Hoyas
to victory and leave the Panthers with an
empty feeling as, the heartbreaking loss
stretched the streak to 34 with only three
games remaining before postseason play.

Logan expressed her disappointment at
seeing another victory slip away from the
Panthers, especially on a day with special
meaning for her family.

“I was trying to be aggressive,” Logan
said. “My grandmother beat breast cancer
and that really gave me a drive to play.”

The tight games and unfortunate heart-
breaking losses for.the squad highlighted
a seasonjin which the team faced adversity
from beginning to end.

Redshirt junior guard Abby Dowd dealt
with injuries all year. Logan continued to
have trouble ‘with her’ surgically repaired
shoulder. Freshman pointguard Brittany
Gordon required foot surgery midway

“We worked

really, really
hard. Getting
Coach B. this

win is just
joyful.”
Brianna Kiesel

through the season. -

Though ﬁnally somewhat healthy en-
tering the Big East Tournament, the Pan-
thers dropped their ﬁrst—round game to
the Marquette Golden Eagles, 66-43. The
matchup marked the ﬁnal game as a mem-
ber of the Big East Conference for Pitt.

“It is a tough way to end our existence
in the Big East,” Berenato said. “It is with-
out a doubt that this conference has been
the best women’s basketball conference in
the country the last few years.”

The Panthers will have plenty of time
this offseason to recover and prepare for
a new brand of basketball in the Atlantic
Coast Conference next season.

Surely the storyline headed into next

season will focus on the ﬁrst collegiate "

game action for 6-foot-11 redshirt fresh-
man center Marvadene “Bubbles” Ander-
son. The highly publicized recruit hopes
to give Pitt a much—needed inside presence
on both sides of the ball next year.

One of the Panthers’ main faults this
season was giving up "easy buckets right
around the rim. With the insertion of An-
derson into an experienced lineup, Pitt
will hope to start a new streak: a substan-
tial conference winning streak. g

TORCH  

a great coaching staff on the sideline.

pointing you in the right directions.”

Winners

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon has al-
ways made it a priority to recruit win-
ners: unselfish players who come from

. 4 successful prep programs. Pitt’s current

backcourt members personify these

, characteristics as well as anyone has un-

der Dixon. They’ll do whatever it takes to
win and have won a lot as a result.
Woodall hails from Brooklyn, N.Y., but
he played high school basketball at St.
Anthony in Jersey City, N.]. He lettered

. four seasons under legendary head coach

Bob Hurley and led St. Anthony to a per-
fect 32-0 record, a No. 1 national rank-
ing and a national championship as a
senior in 2008. M-ature beyond his years,

\ Woodall started as a freshman, a rarity at

a basketball powerhouse such as Pitt.~Yet
he was selﬂess enough to come off the
bench as a senior because of his concern
with the ultimate team goal of winning.
At Pitt, Woodall played an integral
part of a number of highly successful
teams. He came off the bench his first
two years but has started his last‘ two
seasons. ‘Throughout ‘his career, he’s
improved tremendously, transforming
from a quick, slick—passing point guard

 

to a more complete player. The result
of this improvement, besides wins, is
something only six former Pitt players
can boast: 1,000 career points and 500
assists.

Perhaps most importantly of all, when
his team is reeling or in need of a timely
bucket,-Woodall almost always makes a

' play —— a point he demonstrated against’

Villanova when setting up Robinson.
Like Woodall, Robinson just wins. '
While most players can point to stats

to deﬁne their talents, Robinson’s will

to win is most evident in his record. At

De‘Matha, he earned three Washington

Catholic Athletic Conference champion— '

ships, while compiling 120 wins in four
years — a school record.
“The most impressive thing for me

‘is that he graduated as the winningest

player in our school’s history,” Jones
said of Robinson. “So many greats [have
played here], but he won more_ than any
of them.” '

Similarly to Woodall, Robinson
knocked down a number of clutch buck-
ets this season, including the aforemen-
tioned 3-pointers in Pitt’s dramatic tri-
umph over Villanova. V _

There’s no special formula detailing

how to win games. To come out on top,‘

Robinson said his team just needs to
scratch and claw and do anything neces-
sary to win, especially when trailing.
‘fWhen you’re down and there’s only a
couple minutes left in the game, you just
have to have that ﬁghter’s mentality and

just know you and the rest of your team-
mates pretty much have to do anything
and everything that you can to crawl
back into the game,” he said.

When Woodall knocks down clutch‘
‘buckets like he often does, some might

wonder ‘who will hit those shots in the
future. "

But Woodall is unﬂinchingly conﬁ-
dentin his fellow point guard.

“James has been ready to lead this
team all season,” Woodall said. “He does
things that freshmen usually don’t come
in and do. He’s ready to be a leader on
this team for years.”

Passing the torch .
It started with Knight, then Krauser,
Fields and now Woodall. They all shared
their knowledge with the next man, and
Woodall learned something from‘ each of
them. .
‘-‘I take a little .bit from each,” Wood-

all said in an interview with USA Today. -

“Patience from Levance, leadership and
talking from Brandin, being aggressive
from Carl.” _

This season, it’s been Woodall’s turn
to pass on his basketball prowess to the
next Pitt point guard. He says he feels
comfortable with that leadership role.

“I put it on‘ myself, all of it,” Woodall

- said. “That’s just how I feel.”

While Woodall undoubtedly remains

"the team’s biggest leader, as a starter,

Robinson sometimes feels like he needs
to speak up too.

“Some days you have to be a little
more vocal than others. Some days you
have to know how everybody’s feeling,”
Robinson said. “You have to know what
you can say to some guys. Just knowing
what to say to a certain guy to get him
motivated to play that much better or
that much harder.” .

But like Woodall, Robinson prefers
toelead by example. Hesays that both
Woodall and Knight, who is now an as-
sistant coach with the Panthers, have
helped him learn how to display leader-
ship in different situations.

“Having those two guys around every
day, you can learn so much from them,”
Robinson said of Woodall and Knight. “It
just makes everything go a lot smoother
in your life and helps you a lot on the
court.” ’ . C

With the NCAA tournament coming
up this week, Robinson has one goal in
mind: winning for his senior teammates,
Woodall and forward Dante Taylor. ,

And seeing Woodall and Taylor break

‘down in tears during the post-game press
conference following the Senior Day Vil-
lanova game, Robinson stated that he
wants to continue the winning tradition
at Pitt. '

“It means a lot to me to see the emo— ’

tions of these two guys. It just goes to
show you how hard they worked in their
careers here,” he said. “I thank them for
everything that they’ve helped me with
so far this year. I want to keep building
the legacy that they left.” ﬂ

f‘I’m looking to doing what I do best,
which is be a spark off the bench ahdjust
provide for my team and go out there and
play hard,” Moore said. A

Another bench player, senior forward
Dante Taylor, is happy to have the chance
to get back to the tournament after Pitt
missed the‘NCAA tournament and settled
for a berth in the third-tier College Bas-
ketball Invitational last season.

“Last year we weren’t able to make it,
and we’re usuallya team that does,” Taylor
said. “We’re‘ just happy that we get the
opportunity to go out there and play and
prove ourselves.” 1

At the top, Dixonlbelieves the key to
thePanthe~rs »“proving'themselves” lies in
the ability to win close games, a necessity
to make a run deep into the tournament.

_“You gotta win close games,” Dixon
said. “You’re ‘not going to play great all
the way through. You gotta ﬁnd a way and
make acouple plays at the end.’.’ «
