“If anything, it’ might help
collective bargaining.”

The Provost’s area contains
some 2,000 faculty eligible to
vote in March and is the largest
single academic unit at Pitt.

In other. union *news, the
American Association of Univ-
ersity Professors, one of the
three faculty organizations in
the elections, announced Friday
it intends to ﬁle an exception to
a State Labor Boardruling that
excluded department chairmen

The first proposal putting stu-
dents at the bargaining table with‘
faculty and administration if a
faculty union is elected next week
was made public at Friday’s
University Senate forum on collec-
tive bargaining.

The forum was held to generate
discussion and questions about the
role of collective bargaining for
faculty at Pitt. The proposal to

dmit students to the bargaining
"~-4.-iirocess was announced by Melvin
Moser, one of the speakers
presenting the student point of
view.

The Moser proposal provided for
‘student negotiators to be included
on the management and faculty
union teams and for the appoint-
ment of two enrolled students as
observers in any collective bargain-
mg.

Student participation at the
bargaining table could become a

‘crucial issue if a faculty union wins
in any of the four separate elections
slated for March 9 and 10 in the

ﬂedical School. L.» : School,

- raduate Schools of Public Health
and other schools lumped in the
Provost’s area.

The Moser proposal is a
response by student governance

Someone broke into the yearbook offices over the weekend by forcing _
open a locked door and proceeded to pry open this file cabinet._ A small .
amount of cash reportedly was taken. A similar break-in occurred over _
the weekend in the Learning Skills Center in 500 S.U., directly above

Smith posed a series of,
questions in the letter, which
was mailed Friday. One
question was: “Would contin-
uing union pressures in a time
of relatively stable resources
ultimately force us into re-
trenchment...?”

“We can and must,” the
letter continued. “find the
resources necessary both from
income and from prudent
economies, to maintain and
improve a competitive position
on faculty salaries appropriate

made at the bargaining table could
profoundly affect student interests,

Reaction by Pitt administrators

although the Pitt Professional

sors (AAUP) are expected to review

to a ﬁrst-rate university.

None of the union leaders

Shaken by a recently announced
$300 increase in tuition, students at
Duquesne University held a rally
Friday afternoon to express their
dissatisfaction, but while they were
chanting "‘We,won’t stand for it,”
student leaders were voicing little
hope of stopping the hike.

party interest at the bargaining
table. In the past, representatives
of the Pennsylvania Labor Rela-

have no place in labor negotiations
under law.

The Moser proposal attempts to
skirt obstacles and oversights in
state law by bringing student
negotiators into the bargaining
room under the wings of faculty

fwnion and administration bargain-

' observers, particularly students,
could be resolved through a

binding agreement or legal stipul-

Although students do not parti-

view, were two of 12 scheduled
speakers at the forum. Other
scheduled speakers addressed the
impact and outcome of faculty
collective bargaining, speaking to a
record audience of 200 to 250
faculty members. students and
administrators.

Pro-union speakers included the
heads of the leading tm-ulty union
organizations involved in the
elections, stressing theneed for
collective‘ bargaining in the light of
state cutbacks in education funding
a decline in ﬁnancial and enroll-
ment pictures for most institutions
and the‘ importance of forming a
lobbying spearhead to bring the
needs of Pitt to Harrisburg.

Representatives of the pro-union
stand hit the Teachers for an
liidependent Faculty, an anti-union
group, for acknowledging the
problems facing Pitt and yet
offering no alternative.

One TIF spokesman, Dr. Ned
Arnett of the chemistry depart-
ment, said faculty unionization was

Duquense Students Rally  
To Protest $300, Hike

( Continued from Page 1)
President and Treasurer Frederick
R. Clark, also was prompted by
Gov. Milton Shapp’s proposal to
allocate Duquesne only $321,000.
The University had requested
$600,000. . » t

Hurley urged students attending
the rally to write their state
legislators to advocate reallocation
of the $300,000 cut by Shapp. The
vote on that measure will take place,
at the end of June‘.

Even if Duquesne receives the
entire amount requested, it still
will face a projected deﬁcit of at
least $270,000. Since students are
the source of more than 90% of
Duquesne’s—revenues, tuition was a
natural place to start in generating
additional revenue for the private
school, students said.

Tuition is currently $76 per credit
at Duquesne, or $2,530 per year for

The increase, approved Friday

Another rally is scheduled to

to be there.

While students at Duquesne are

discussion to move more slowly,

' but still to ﬁnish earlier this year.

Last year,_Shapp recommended a
3.5% increase for Pitt, but the
University ended up with 12.5%
after the budget hearings.

A spokesman for Pitt’s Govern-
ment Relations Office said an
increase as dramatic as last year’s
is not anticipated.

Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee members told Posvar and the
heads of Penn State and Temple
University not to expect much.
Committee head Henry Cianfrani
said, “It won’t do any good for
them to pressure .us for more. The
money just isn’t there."

Funds for Pitt’s dental clinic
were cut completely in the
governor’s recommendation. Pos-_
var said, however, he felt the funds '
would be restored.

The dental clinic was given
$500,000 this year.

A special session for medical
school appropriations was to be
tomorrow, but Posvar said. it was
cancelled because of an overloaded

calendar. The medical budget will
be worked into the general
hearings, he explained.

Pitt asked for an increase in the

er-capita grant for med students
—fr_om $7,465, maintained for ﬁve
straight years, to $9,908. The
budget presentation predicts Pitt’s
Medical School will operate at a $1

1 million deﬁcit during the current

year.

“If we again receive no increase
in the next ﬁscal year, we can have
no choice but to make crippling
reductions in medical programs,
which can permanently damage our
ability to provide quality, medical
education for Pennsylvania stu-
dents,” the report said.

This year’s 33% tuition hike for _

med students kept the deﬁcit from
becoming larger, the report ‘said.
General tuition was also increas-
ed this year, despite the ﬁnal
' increase in state appropriations. A
14% hike last summer raised
tuition to $1,140.

,Your Move, Unions

The proposal made by student Melvin Moser at Friday’s special

Senate Council session on unionization cannot be ignored by the unions

vying for faculty votes. ,
Moser’s system would have Student Government being permitted by

ﬂi both the administration and any faculty union to participate in

” collective bargaining. As it stands now, students in Pennsylvania
, aren’t considered a party at the bargaining table, and so nothing short

of new legislation will guarantee students a participatory status.
The participation Moser recommends would require rlot a revision of

- state law, but only the consent of the administration and the union.

' Essentially, what Moser wants is a student ‘negotiator who would be
‘selected as a bargaining representative for the administration and one
who would be a representative of the union.

Although chosen by the parties, the student negotiators would be
independent of both sides. They would be able to introduce and initiate
proposals and would have the same access to information as other

' negotiators.

Student negotiators would be able to present the student perspective
to both sides of a contract -dispute and with such guaranteed
participation that there‘ would be no need for a court injunction

A , sponsored bystudents seeking to end a strike.

In addition to the two student negotiators, two student observers
also would sit at the bargaining table, but would not be able to initiate
proposals. They would act solely through the student negotiators and
would initial any formal agreement between the union and the
administration.

The advantages of the student negotiator/observer plan are many.
Such participation would ensure students of some knowledge of the
negotiations, thereby promoting student acceptance and support.

It also would give students a workable, digniﬁed alternative to the
type of uninvited third-party futility that breeds injunction-seeking and
legislative lobbying for forced participation.

We think the Moser plan comes closest to accommodating students
in the negotiating process and deserves theutmost consideration of the
three contending unions. ,' ,

We urge students to attend Student ,Government’s presentation on
unionization tomorrow at 3 p.m. -in the Student Union lower lounge.
Each faction’s argument will be presented, and we expect to hear the
ﬁrst ofﬁcial replies to Moser’s plan from the unions.

This alone will make attendance worthwhile.

Bunions Are Blooming  

If you run into someone today who hobbles into class or at least
treads softly, it’s likely to be one of the Greek Charity Walk’s hikers
giving solace to bandaged bunions and compound calluses.

Pitt’s Greeks took on 10 miles of Pittsburgh sidewalk Saturday in

their annual effort to assist a local charity. This year's beneﬁt was for

the Allegheny Home for Exceptional Children; walkers belonging to
fratemities and sororities secured pledges per mile to raise donations.
Though the weekend’s unseasonable sunshine made the walk look

if _ like less of a chore than it actually was, the students participating gave

up a clay in the heart of the midterm -season, plus the hours it will take
this week to collect on the pledges.

It’s annual charity drives like the one for Allegheny Valley that
undermine some of the criticism leveled against fraternities and
sororities.

    The Presidential Olympics

' BY W. JACK ROMBERG '

We Americans have strange

-ways of choosing -presidents. It

begins in February in an obscure
little mudhole in the northeast part
of the country and goes on for
months. Even stranger are the
illogical conclusions drawn from
the results of the voting in this
mudhole‘.

Seventy percent of the Demo-
crats who voted in New Hampshire
did not want Jimmy Carter. This
fact has established him" as the
current frontrunnér for his party.
Forty-nine percent of the Republi-
cans gave Ronald Reagan a
stunning victory and the 51% who
voted for President Ford severe
delusions. ,,

All this climaxes in a Nov.
election, when it is possible‘ to. gain
a plurality of'the'people’s votes and
still lose. It’s happened (Benjamin
Harrison over Grover Cleveland in
1888). Clearly some better method
of choosing a president is neces-
sary.

First, this new method must be
efﬁcient. Let’s not waste citizens’
valuable time by having them vote
and follow political speeches for
practically a year on national
television. Second, it must produce
a president with qualities dear to
the hearts of the American people.

The simplest solution is to have a
presidential olympics; a~series of
contests staged between different
candidates to determine the most.
qualiﬁed. Award gold, silver and
bronze medals in each catagory.
Highest medal total takes the
presidency, second highest the vice
presidency. Finally, hold these
olympics in May, so they will not
conflict with the winter or summer
Olympics. '

In order to qualify for the
Presidential Olympics, one merely
has to be rich or famous enough
and pass the name test. The name
test is a simple screening process

For State Treasurer, the Demo-

State Democrats). Pennsylvania

"eliminating candidates with names
like Birch Bayh’s, sounding more
like a brand of soft drink than the
nomenclature of a president.

The presidential Olympics
should be federally funded. That
eliminates contribution scandals
and prevents anyone from buying

the election. Perhaps the, NCAA

even could be persuaded to provide
the officials and oversee the
contests, giving the whole affair an
air of collegiality._

Now, for your perusal, here is a -‘

list of proposed contests!

Bib|ethumping,——_An important
quality of the ideal president is his
ability to invoke the grace of God.
In this contest, candidates must
prove their evangelical ability in
three ways-,-—by appealing for
increased morality, humbling
themselves before the Almighty
and asking his grace for the
country. This will be judged by an
interdenominational board consist-
ing of a minister, a priest and a
rabbi.

.Tree,stumping—This is a throw-
back to the American tradition of
campaigning from tree stumps.
Candidates are _given the text of

‘one of the speeches of William
Jennings Bryan and are judged on ,

their ability to relatevit in a fiery,
down‘-home manner to backwoods-
men. The. winner receives the
“Golden Orator of the Platte”
award.

Somnolethon——A modern version
of tree stumping; Candidates are
given, the text of a speech by
Lyndon Johnson. After their
renditions are videotaped, they are
replayed to insomniacs around the
country. 8 ' I

The candidate who cures the
fewest is given the gold medal.

Palm-pressing—Candidates are
lined up at the end of a long street
ﬁlled with cheering multitudes.
Each candidate must run a timed
gauntlet_ through the throng,
shaking as many hands as possible

along the way. The candidate who
shakes the most hands takes the
gold. Points are _ subtracted for
bleeding and eallousing. ,
Whistle-stopping:—Each candi-
date is given a train with which to
do a whistle-stop, coast~to-co ~

tour of the country. Candidates at"r‘....,."¢

they complete the_tour and on the
number of people they draw at each.
stop. Since this is a measure of
public appeal, it should help
silence those critics who claim the

A Olympics are undemocratic.
Routes must follow established

Amtrak lines.

Lambasting—A good way _to
preserve the tradition of mudsling-
ing while making sure it is all in the
spirit‘ of the contest. This is a
no-holds-barred contest in which
candidates hurl insults at each
other.
originality, humor and subtlety.

The only off-limits subject is the
reputation of a candidate’s mother
(if he has one). ’

Charismatica—This_ measures a
candidate's ability to gain national
attention via appearances on
television specials, game shows
and the like.

There are two levels of judging
here——'the quality of the television
show and the performance render-
ed. Forexample, an appearance on
The Friars Roast is worth a whole
week’s appearance on The Holly-
wood Squares. This can be made

bathtub appeal. Participation / f _
song_and dance numbers is also
noteworthy. ‘

To get an added measure of
public participation, each network
would carry different candidates.
Candidates scoring [the highest
Nielsen ratings would earn medals
toward their final totals.

And Americans once again will
have exercised their democratic
rights.

PAT’s Failure

BY GEORGE W. DULL

The Port Authority Transit (PAT)
tried and failed to get its hand into
the public purse. PAT wanted tax
monies to support its questionable
efforts to provide the community
with satisfactory public transporta-
tion. The recent fare hike is an
admission of failure on the part of
the Port Authority, and public
transportation should be returned

to private owneship as soon as

possible.

The result of PAT’s failure to
share the rip-off of the public purse
is to make those people who are
dependent on public transportation
the scapegoats for PAT’s failures
and sins.

It seems the object of the
Authority is to discourage the

The whole situation,

the" individual automobile. At a
time‘ when fares should have been
reduced 10 cents, the Authority
decides to raise them. Anyone
who has been riding buses in this
town for 10 years is surely aware of
the pattern the Authority uses.
Where the hell. do these political
appointees and bureaurats think
the money is coming from to pay
for their spree. Someone should go
to the country commissioners, the
Port Authority, et al., and tell them
the story about the goose who laid
the golden eggs.

One possible answer to the
wretched transit situation in
Pittsburgh is a boycott. Persons
willing to walk the reasonable
distances many of us now ride
would add healthy years to their
lives. I am sure motorists would

support a boycott because they,
too, are taxpayers. People manag-
ing during the transit strikes and
could manage again.

The history of public transit in
Allegheny County is, without
doubt, replete with the misuse of
public funds. Potential systems and
routes have been surveyed to the
ultimate. The commissioners them-
selves are responsible for this
mess. No doubt, contract after
contract, study after study, has
been farmed out in the most
profitable fashion—most profitable
for those sitting in the County
Office Building. One cannot help
wondering about kickbacks".

‘Bridal Fair

  Big Bucks F 0

BY CONNIE GIEL

The yards of lace and frilly
nightgowns elicited more giggles
and guffaws than oohs and ahhs
from the several hundred area
brides-to-be at last weekend's
Bridal Fair.

It seems today's young women
are more sophisticated, less taken
by silk and taffeta than their
mothers. Still, while some young
women poked their friends and
laughed, there were a few
star-struck girls who_ couldn't get
enough of the trousseaus and

 wedding gowns. I
 /2;]? The Bridal Fair, an annual event

sponsored by WWSW and WPEZ
radio stations (and formerly by
KQV), was‘an evening of selective
advertising and good-natured
hype.- Wives-to-be browsed in the
Syria Mosque halls among cosme-
tic booths and waterbeds, flowers
and refrigerators. V

~ The salesmen staffing the booths
made no bones about it—they were
there to push their products, to
make a buck off the pretty young
things who soon will be furnishing
homes and wardrobes.

BY TOM HALL

It sat there—still, lifeless.- A
dormant, inanimate object, but
hardly harmless. It might be on
any road, in any town, but its
numbersare almost limitless in the
Western Pennsylvania area. It is,
of course, a pothole, lying in wait
for its next victim.

On Wednesday morning, Feb.
25, I was traveling along East
Hardies Road in Hampton Town-

‘ ship at approximately 40 m.p.h.,

which, due to the condition of the
road, is hardly a safe legal limit.
There were’ two important factors
working’ against me that morning.
The first was that I drive that

~ particular road practically every
day, as it is a direct route from my ‘

girlfriend's farm to my favorite
hangout—the Venus Diner. I knew
every hole on that godforsaken
lane, or so I thought. ‘

The -other factor was the
presence _of my companions. Dave
and" Mary trusted my driving
implicitly. But more than that, like
its driver, they trusted my
automobile.

At a time when students hardly
can afford the luxury and safety of
a decent car, Ihappened to stumble

Strangely enough, no music was
piped in, though the event was
sponsored by two radio stations.
“It would be kind of bad for the
stations to compete all night; this
isn't the right. atmosphere for
that," .a WWSW staffer explained.

Volkswagen 411, type IV.
This car had everything and
unlike most American’ automobiles,
it was safe, efficient and had the
handling of a Mercedes Benz. I
had just replaced the front disc
brakes, had had the rack and pinion
steering tightened and had the
engine timed to perfection. It was
the least I could do for such a
reliable, trustworthy friend.
I topped the crest of a hill. and as
I expected, confronted the first
collection of potholes. But
something wasn’t right. Either
they had gotten bigger, or new
ones had appeared. Instead of
simply straddling the collage, as
usual, I was forced to pull off the
road. This was the turning point.
My back tires caught in the mud
of the road’s shoulder, they slid to
the right and my buddy, the car,
fishtailed wildly. I pulled it back on
the road, but Iwas approaching the
far side of the oncoming lane.
There was another snag—the
appearance of a telephone pole.

crucial turn. Slowly, carefully, I

WWSW Sports Director Stan

He said weddings have become

crisp white-——matChing the brides-
maids’ gowns. Savran, who insis-
ted “The groom’s not there just to
be there; he deserves to be seen,
too," introduced the men with
great zeal.

The soft lights and music,
however, couldn’t convince a girl
who poohed-poohed the frills and
said she was being married in a
pantsuit. .“This crap is ridiculous.
Why spend money on something
you’ll only wear once?’.’

She did seem impressed,
though, by the Heads Together
waterbeds displayed downstairs.
“That’s where my money’s go-
ing,” she said, oblivious to the
Frigidaire saleman at the other
end, who muttered “This is a
captive audience,” then turned to
show a girl and her mother the
wonderous touch-control stove.

“This age group, and this
situation, is kind of peculiar,” he
said. “These brides want to buy
everything at once, but then they

wind up buying little trinkets that '

won’t last. ’ ’

The Bridal Fair may have left-
many Pittsburgh young women
more befuddled than before, but
it’s all part of the marriage market.

It iSPoetry Forum

BY KARAN REKASIE

. The International Poetry Forum
-‘presented readings Wednesday by
rtree recipients of major poetry
awards: ‘Mark Halperin (United
_, States Award of the International
Poetry Forum, 1975), Ed Ochester
'}and Gerald Costanzo (The Devins
_, ‘Award—1973 and 1974, respective-
,1 .)’ I .
Jon Anderson introduced the
poets and began with a definition:
“If you don’t understand it and it
makes you nervous, then it’s art.”
Next he read a telegram: “Tell
-Mark to relax, don’t apologize.
' Give ’em...heck.” Then he quoted
a few lines and happened to glance
Hat, Ochester when he read, “Fat
man in an easy chair.” Chuckles.
. Finally he remarked that ‘whenever
someone asks Contanzo how he is,
the reply is always, “Worse than
’ ever.”
A In his meticulous suit, Constanzo
-1 at ﬁrst seemed a soft-spoken
’ high-school principal, until he
began to speak. Irony is a major
.technique in his work. In “lrony’s
 Picnic,” irony doesn’t even show
up.
Other subjects treated include:
grasshoppers, blue loons, a ﬂag-
’7pole sitter and the death of Guy
- ‘Lombardo, “which hasn’t happen-
fed yet.” " I
He admitted that in writing
‘Jungles’, “some of my students
‘(at C-MU) gave me some help with
it.” He finished with a poem from
his book: “In the Aviary...deeper
into the beautiful garden, vultures
circle Vour heart like apostles of
grief marking time.” A curious
admixture of rambunctiousness
and sublime cynicism.
Halperin started with a ‘poem in

which he took the perspective of a
deserted wife. He then read a poem
about John Clare, who had
“moments of lucidity "in his

insanity”: p“If we are both John

Clare, /‘why does he go away?/ and
where? and where?” He presented
two last poems; one was for luck.

spoke of the collectivity of people.
“We have not single lives. We are
grass, trees, roots intertwined-
mile upon, mile.” .

The evening was remarkable for
its diversity of style and subject,
and for its unity and smooth-going
reflections of life. ‘

 

The poets at Wednesday’s Poetry Forum, from left: Gerald
Costanzo, Mark Halperln and Ed Ochester. '

“Why not?” He ended with “the
living animal in me has guided me
back home” "The poems, in
his book, Back Roads, made fre-
quent references to the Northwest
countryside, nature and family life.

Ochester began with his “Kiski
River Towns," a poem in which
people “look different probably
because of the atomic materials
plant in the town where they live.”
Then he read “The Miners at
Revloc,” in which a chain
exists—the miners consume “ﬁne
black salt” in their meals and then
feed the mills with “wafers of their
flesh.”

He said he didn't want to be
known as a “writer of dirty
poems,” but read several “ques-
tionable ones” anyway. His last
two were dream poems. In one he

Kessler Spins Magic Scene

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

The gang was at Heinz Hall for
last Friday’s performance of
Coppelia, but basically it was a
one-woman show. The ﬁnal curtain
call included a bouquet of roses for
Dagmar Kessler, and they were
certainly well-deserved.

As a story, Coppelia is complet-
ely insipid. A group of rustic
viIlagers—men and women alike—
is abnormally attracted to Cop-
pelia, a lifelike mechanical doll who

Cassavetes’ Realism Boring I

close—ups sticks out too often in
incongruous scenes. And the usual
lack of a musical soundtrack leaves
a hollow-sounding plot even more
hollow.

True. Cassavetes has always
made movies that look very
strongly—sometimes harshly—at

reality. and his spartan directing
has rounded out the theme. But
realism. even when strong and
harsh, is not necessarily interest-

‘ ing. And that's the problem with

.4/if/"(but original) stories and music.

Chinese Bookie.

The plot concerns Cosmo Vitelli
(Ben Gazzara), the owner of a
sleazy strip joint who tries to dress
up the ho-hum act with some tired"

His sketches like “An Evening in
Paris" and “Gunfight at the OK
Corral," starring some nubile
nymphs and a dirty-old-man
emcee, seem more like old-time
burlesque than modern (but
raunchier) places.

Anyway, right after paying off
the loan sharks, Gazzara celebrates
by going to a private gambling club
and promptly losing a lot more than
he can afford. And, rather than be
stiffed ,by the sharks again, he
agrees to do a little job for his
creditors; Right: he sets out to kill
a guy referred to simply as a
Chinese bookie.

Part of the problem with Chinese

3 ~.,_Bookie is that the print now making

,5.-

it to theaters seems to be a lot less
than Cassavetes intended. P

The characters remain unexplor-

ed “types." Even Cosmo is not too

well represented. He comes across V

as a simple blowhard who tries
awfully hard at pretension by.
parading about with a “stable” of
his girls and by announcing those

pathetic little pageants his strip

joint features.

Obviously, Chinese Bookie
portrays the running of a strip joint
as a pretty dreary business, no
more exciting than, say, account-
ing. There's _no glamorization of

 

  

Meade Roberts as the M.C. in

the act, and male viewers

expecting lots of tits and ass would

do better at the flicks playing
Liberty Avenue.

Cassavetes does do some very
interesting shooting of the dancing
scenes, though. He tellingly leaves
the heads and faces of the women
out of the frame, thus reducing the
pretension Cosmo builds up about
entertainment to the blatant
sensationalism of near-nude
bodies.

One thing that is’ amazing about
Chinese Bookie is (no pun
intended) the booking. For some
reason, the film is playing the
Warner, one of the really big-
screen theatres around. Chinese
Bookie is a ﬁlm with an “artier”
appeal, and would look much better
on a small screen, say, like the one
at the Forum.

Conversely, The Man Who

‘Would Be King, the flick at the

Forum, is a John Huston big-
screen adventure epic that needs

the strippers’ jointfrom The Killing of

_all the square yards of screen it can
get. It doesn’t have the same effect

on a small screen that it would on a
larger one, just like last year’s The
Wind and the Lion. Blowing up
Chinese Bookie on the Warner
screen emphasizes the graininess
of the film’s indoor sequences,
which doesn’t help the movie.

the Ballet
Theatre's corps can do with proper"
staging and training. With Kessler
providing a model in lightness and
spirit, they followe.d through
beautifully, individually and in
unison.

Unfortunately, Coppelia is a
ballet in three acts.- There really is
no need for the last act, other than
to bring the entire corps on stage
for the finale and to provide a few
solos and pas de deux for Franz and
Swanhilda. _

The effect of that last act dilutes
the impact of Kessler’s enchanting
performance in Act II. Neverthe-
less, her skill and spirit managed to
triumph over every obstacle,
including the sometimes garish
costuming, and a last act which
kept most of the corps on stage for
the entire time looking unnecessary
and helpless. Even Alexander

Pantherettes Nip

    Temple, 62-59

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette basketball team
edged the Temple Owls, 62-59, in a
tight contest at'the Field House
Saturday afternoon. -

. _ The early going found Pitt off
‘and running with a quick lead, but
towards the end, of the third
quarter, Temple started to turn ‘it
on and swiftly pulled to within one
point. ’ ‘

The Pantherette offense, which
seems to be much more suscept-
able to the ﬁrst-half sloppies lately,

. I’ couldn't "ﬁnd the range, and the
‘score hung at 21-20 for more than
two minutes until forward Barb
Welsh connected from the charity
stripe.

Pitt came back from a 26-24
halftime lead to give one of its
hottest offensive bursts of the
season, leaping ahead 40-30.

 Butthe game wasn’t wrapped up

--“that easily; Temple fought back

and into the contest, tossing in 11
points to the Pantherettes’ four.

And the Owls pulled closer still.
With her team down by one,"

Temple’s Denise Glenn intercepted ‘

a ‘Diane Zaken pass, ran the length
of the court and hit on an
uncontested layup.

Guard Leslie Diehl, in one of her
best games of the year, immediate-
ly connected from outside the key

to hand the lead back to Pitt. A few
plays later, she ﬂipped an assist to
Robin Frye to cement it. _ 6

‘‘‘Leslie had a very good game,”

"head coach Pat Wallace said.

“Kit’s
(Jones) rebounding kept us

(Loefﬂer) -’ and Debbie’s
in

"there . ’ ’

Jones grabbed 23 rebounds, her‘
best effort since the 30 she
collected against .G1assboro at the
Pitt Invitational in ' December.
Loeffler collected 12.

Jones led all scorers’ with 15

points, Robin Frye added 14 and

Loefiler chipped in 12.

“I thought, we could’ve put
Temple away twice,” Wallace said,
“and we didn’t. They were a very
physical team.” - -

At any rate, the Temple game
proved a good workout for the
Pantherettes, who will face Slip-
pery Rock (7-4) tomorrow. Slippery

Rock defeated Pitt on the ill-fated"

road trip two weeks ago.

Revenge would be particularly
sweet, especially since both teams
are entered
Easterns that Pitt will host.

“We’re going to have to play
very well,’’ Wallace said.

Associate Sports Editor

When the Pittsburgh Penguins
» were ﬂoundering in mid-January,
}the management was faced with a
'6 tough decisionintrying to get the
iteambacfk on the winning trail.
There were two choices—ﬁre the
-i 20 ‘lplayers or ﬁre coach Marc
~_;_Boileau. --

"comes the cry in such a dilemma,
so naturally—good-bye, Boileau.
,The Penguins sought help for
behind the bench and found K_€.f!
‘Schinkel, a former player, coach
and current director of scouting
‘, and player personnel for the
if Penguins.
 “Schinkel-’s first call came during
— the ' 1972-73 season when he
Fareplaced Red Kelly at the helm (in
'.-'What’ many knowledgable fans
‘thought was a bad move). He led
!'the Penguins practically ‘nowhere
__.;.before being replaced by Boileau in
‘January, 1974. Boileau became the
-.winningest coach in Penguin
history before things turned sour
and he, too, got the ax.
_' ‘Since taking over on Jan. 17,
- Schinkel has led the Penguins to a
’ 12-2-6 record, unbeaten in their
last 11 games (7-O-4) before last
 I night's 5-3 loss to the St. Louis
. Blues. Pittsburgh is now right
“ behind the Los Angeles Kings in
; the Norris Division and picking up
‘momentum for the Stanley Cup
‘playoffs:
“I’d. like to win the Stanley
4 Cup,” Schinkel said. “Right now,
'-though, from the time I've taken
over, our main goal is to get as
. many points as we can and get as
high up in the standings as we
can.

, “Ithink we have a good shot at

overtaking L.A., but our goal is to
1 get as many points as we can so we
{have the home-ice advantage and

“You can't fire the whole team,” ,

go as far as we can in the playoffs
and eventually win the Stanley
Cup.”

The Cup has eluded Schinkel
in his 23 years in hockey. Schinkel
was a checking forward ‘and a
penalty-killer for the New York
Rangers (with ‘many trips to
Springfield and Baltimore in the
minor leagues for seasoning),
before coming to Pittsburgh in the
1967 expansion draft. - V

Schinkel’s. hat trick against the
Chicago Black Hawks that year was
the first for an expansion team

 

KEN SCHINKEL

player against an established team.
He played in the 1968 All-Star
game and was picked again in
1970, butpa shoulder injury kept
him out of the action. His best
years were 1968-69, when he
scored 52 points, and 1969-70,
when he tallied 20 goals and 25
assists.

Schinkel currently finds himself

in a totally different role. “There

are all kinds of differences between
playing and coaching,” he said.
“When you’re a player, you only
have to worry about one individual
—yourself. And now as coach,
you’ve got to analyze 20 guys.
“You’re a loner. You don’t have
anybody to go with. You don’t have
anybody to talk with on the road.
As a player, at least you could sit
with the 18 or 20 guys on the team

and have a few drinks and talk over
a game. Now, as coach, you’ve got
to sit by yourself.

“It’s tough being a coach,
because it’s a lonely existence.”

Of course, coaching is not all
bad, and when you’re coaching the
hottest team in hockey, as is
Schinkel, it can be terriﬁc. Schinkel
also takes great pleasure in seeing
the younger guys perform.

“It’s a great satisfaction to
develop a young lad, bring him
along and see him do well-
like Pierre Larouche,” Schinkel
said. “I had the opportunity to
scouthim and made -the recommen-

-dation to draft him when our turn

came up two years ago, and last
year, he almost won the Rookie of
the Year award. He should have
won it.

“Now, when you see young guys

. like Larouche and Owchar and

Campbell and Faubert coming
a1ong—and we’ve got that young
Laxton down there in Hershey-
when you have a hand in develop-
ing these kids, that’s a great satis-
faction.” ~

It seems it would be easier for
Schinkel to deal with the younger
players—since he _can speak with
them on a father-to-son basis—
thanwith the older players like" Ron
Schock and Vic Hadfield, who are

,practically his peers (Schinkel is 41.

years old). .

But Schinkel feels you must be
extra careful in/ correcting young
players. The veterans are no
troub1e—they can" take care of
themselves. . M -

“There's a personality —with
every hockey player,” he said.
“Pierre may be a little bit more
moody. His ego is very high and

you can hurt it in a hurry if you ,

reprimand him too hard.

“You- can’t be as harsh to a
younger player in front of all the
players. You have to take him

.aside because he may end up

sulking and pouring and not doing
his job.

“And guys like Hadfield—if they
do their job, you don't-have to say
much to that type of hockey player
because he's been around long
enough and he knows what it takes
to win. But if they goof up, no
matter who they are. you have to
tell them about it. '

“l’ve had to confront Syl Apps a
couple times. It doesn’t take that
much, maybejust a reminder. to let
a veteran player know what he is
doing wrong. It is usually just a
lack of effort and concentration
when things go bad. especially if

you've been around the league for’

a while." ,
_ Schinkel’s current title is “Inter-
im Coach" and whether he will
continue next season is still

unknown. He also is the director off‘-.3
Player ‘Personnel. but if the; ‘.7’
Penguins keep winning. the coach-
ing job next year has got to be his.

“Ifm just going one game at a
time right now," he says after just
about every game to a flurry of
reporters. “I haven't been
thinking about next year at all. I
just want to get into the playoffs by
getting as many points as we can
and go from there.

“I'd never be totally against
coming back next year. but I have
to wait and see how the rest of this
year goes. We haven't really met a
lot of clubs that are pressure clubs.
We’ve had a relatively easy? . 
schedule." . "

Because the Penguins have
made no major player deals this’
season, the change in coaching can
be called their turning point.

58-42 victory Saturday morning.
Pitt took first place in 10 of the 12
