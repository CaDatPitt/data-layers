Artificial Sheep   Insulin Synthesized   I

’  Research for Diabetes}    

The synthesis of ar.tiﬁcial sheep insulin, whose two com—' V
ponent amino acid chains are as active as those of the natural . .
material used in treating diabetics, was ‘conﬁrmed today by
a University team of biochemists. « ' - 1

The team is" headed by Dr. Panayotis G. Katsoyannis,
a Greek-born naturalized American citizen who is an asso-
ciat_e professor of biochemistry in the School of Medicine.

Last October, Dr. Katsoyannis and his associates report-

, ed that they had made the two amino acid chains individually.
and that the A-chain had biological activity similar to that
of the natural insulin while the B chain was still',impure—
and onlyslightly active. Further puriﬁcation of the B-chain
,.was”car'r‘ied‘out and on-November 25, 1963, Dr. Katsoyannis  ‘
_sai_dg_assays. had shownthat it, too, was highly active. 

FRIDAY, l\/[ARCH 6, 1964

 
 

‘DR. PANAYOTIS G. ‘KATSOYANNIS, Greek
born associate professor of Biochemistry in the
School of Medicine, and a team of scientists
under his direction have synthesized artiﬁcial

 

sheep insulin. Here he explains ‘how the syn-
thetic molecule can be constructed of radiac-
tive amino acids‘ and‘ thereby “tagged” _so its
progress can be followed in the body.

Bomb Scare in Langley Hall  

Prompts Immediate Evacuation

By PAT POLLING

A bomb threat earmarked for Langley Hall Wednesday morn-
lng prompted immediate actionfrom University authorities, a whole-
sale evacuation of the building, and a half-hour-plus disruption of
most ten o’clock classes normally scheduled tor the hall.

Students, faculty and ofﬁce personnel in Langley were directed
to. Clapp Hall when the warning came to evacuate on the‘ hour,
while a team of University policemen scoured the natural science
building premesis for a possible explosive device. They were au-
thorized by police to return at 10:30 when it had been determined
that the “scare” had apparently been the work of a prankster.

The chain of events was touched off when University switch-
board operator Mrs. Anne‘Loughrey received an anonymous tele-
phone threat at 9:50 a.m.

   
 

“It 3:7,, _ a man,” said Mrs. Loughrey, “and he said in a very
emphatic” "3;-..e three times. "l‘here will be a bomb placed in Lang'-

ley Hall between 10 and 10:30".’
The switchboard operator explained it did not sound like a stu-
dent, but instead “a much older‘ person with a very deep voice.”
Mrs. Loughrey related that an attempt was made to trace the
call, but was unsuccessful. She then called Captain Charles Ray of
the University police; he called Captain Liles W. Creighton, and the

iQua,n',t’itative measurements of the degree of synthetic" B-'
chain activitywere not available, however, until the Journal

of the American» Chemical Society report today. The team’s ‘

statement stated that the development “appears to represent
the ﬁrst chemical synthesis of a naturally occuring protein.”

v Dr. Katsoyannis"group has been working for more
than ﬁve years to synthesize insulin, the -hormone on
which many diabetics depend for life.

Synthetic insulin has four important consequences in

science and medicine: '

It is the ﬁrst, time man has completely synthesized

'chemically;a protein —— one of the basic building blocks of

all living matter. -

It is the ﬁrst time that the proposed structure of a
protein has been conﬁrmed by chemical synthesis.

With a synthetic molecule, scientists will be able to make
analogs -—- variations in the molecule — to see if they can pro-
duce a type of insulin with more desirable therapeutic ef-
fects. This ability to vary the molecule also will permit them
to better ‘study the relationship’ between how it is built and
how it works. 4 - _

Finally, it will make possible the, incorporation of radio-
active elements as integral parts of the molecule of insulin
and thus might enable scientists to better trace theghormone
in the body. This could be helpful in the search for the basic

Bob  iilc:  
Peterson Praises 
Freshman Cagef

Freshman basketball coach Carl Peterson has at least
two players who he feels will be a help to the varsity
next season. One is Stan Falenski, the team’s leading
scorer, and the other is Ray Pilarski, who didn’t play this
season due -to academic trouble. If Pilarski conquers his
grade problems, Peterson feels he
deserves a “can’t miss” rating. “He
should deﬁnitely be a starter next
season,” Peterson says.

Pilarski’s presence in the line-
up could have made for ,a_ better
season for the freshman. They
were 11-5, but beat, for the most
part, small schools, and lost twice

to their biggest rivals, Duquesne
and West Virginia.

Peterson isn’t the only coach
pleased with "his freshmen. Gym
coach Warren Neiger feels that his

3-03 SMIZIK freshman team will help bring the
gymnasts a winning season in 1965 after two dismal years.
The freshmen, along with three. promising sophomores,
Al Leonhard, Dave McKinnis and Bob Davies, should
bring the gymnasts back to respectability, although it is
doubtful if the team can reach the heights it achieved
during the 1950’s. 1 ‘

Winter varsity sports teams hada combined record
of 35-22, but the basketball and wrestling teams were
the only squads to turn in winning records. .

Lehigh heavyweight wrestler John Illengwarth has
as many pins this season —— six —— asdoes the entire Pan-
ther team for a career. Lee H_all’s two pins is the top
‘career mark for the Panthers.

Picks Johnson To Lose

I_llengwarth is a better wrestler than a forecaster. Be-
fore the Pitt-Lehigh match he said, “Stuart (Bill) will
clean up the mat with Mike Johnson.” Johnson. handed
the previously unbeaten Stuart a 7-2 loss.-~ -.

Lehigh promises‘ to be back among the best in Eastern
wrestling next season. They have one of their best fresh-
man teams in their history and fans there are expecting
the engineers to come away with six individual titles in
the Eastern Freshman Championships.

Lehigh students like their wrestling, but not as much
as the athletic department there thinks. They were sell-
ing more tickets than there were seats, for home wrestling
matches, according to the Lehigh student newspaper, and
then refusing refunds to persons who were not admitted
to the match. Protests by the paper brought an end to
the practice. 1

Al Riccuiti, who played shortstop for the Panther
baseball team last spring, hit .390 in a Florida Instruction-
al League during the winter and is reported to have a
good changeof making the Detroit Tigers this season.

Brian Generalovich isreportedly staying away from
local post-season basketball tournaments where money
is involved so as to maintain his collegiate standing and
thus keep himself eligible for football next season.

The edition of Pittsburgh Weekly Sports now on the
newsstands carries a story concerning football recruiting
here, which says Pitt coaches are having unexpected
trouble in ‘getting the top area players despite last sea-
son’s great record.

_ Still More Basketball

Basketball fans who haven’t had their fill yet this
season can see some top-flight basketball at the YMHA’s
Maccabiah Tournament during the weekends of March
14-15 and 21-22. Some of_the area’s top high school players
are entered in the 18-and under division, while many
former college stars will be playing in the unlimited
division. Sid Cohen, former Kentucky standout, and Alan
Frank, one of Carnegie Tech’s all—time greats, will be -in
action. V '

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis made sure‘ the Panthers
play Penn State this season. He has’ scheduled four
games with the Lions. The two teams have not met for
two seasons now, due to rainouts, and Lewis feels that
the rainouts cost his team NCAA playoff‘ berths both
years. ,

Although the intramural basketball program is run-

-ning much more smoothly than in past years, the criticism
of the officiating is no less this year. As usual the major
complaint concerns the football players. Other teams
complain that the referees, who for the most part are
football players, let the teams made up of football play-
ers get away with too much rough stuff. Bruno’s Boys, a
team composed entirely of gridders and the favorite to
win this year’s title, was almost thrown out of the league
due to rough tactics.

Run in IC4A’s '

Tomorrow

.By HOWARD AINISMAN
' Panther coach Carl Rees
will take six men to the IC4A
‘track meet at Madison Square
Garden tomorrow._
The Panthers will compete
in the mile relay, the 60-yard
 high hurdles,
and the broad
jump; The run-
ners in the re-
lay will be
chos en from
Mike ‘Slutsky,
,, Joe Friend,
Dick Crout,
Luddy Hayden,
and Bob Buell.
" Friend and
Carl Rees H ayden will
run in the‘\hurdles, while Hayden
also will enter the broad jump.
Bad luck scratched two other
-Panther runners. John - Bailey
would have run in the two-mile
race if he hadn’t caught the
measles last week, and sprinter
Bill DelVecchio’s pulled ‘muscle is
still keeping him sidelined.

The mile relay, the high hur-
dles, and the broad jump are
the Panther’s most consistent
events. The relay team’s only

  
   

decision. Hayden and :;Friend
have placed in everyone of their
meets this year, and also Hay-
ren has been over the 22 feet
in the broad jump .on several
occasions.

The IC4A meet is the top col-
legiate event of indoor track in
the East. This year there will be
68‘teams from all over the na-
tion competing. Villanova, Man-
hattan, Army, Navy, Yale, Harv-
ard, and Notre Dame are some of
the outstanding teams entered.

Rees said “Our boys might have
an ‘advantage since the elimina-
tions and the ﬁnals are just a few
hours apart. We have good stam-
ina, and because of the schedul-
ing it might beneﬁt us.

“I feel that Friend should re-
peat his performance. of two
years ago when he ﬁnished in
the top ﬁve, and he could pos-
sibly win. Hayden will face
some stiff competition, but he
also has a good chance to ﬁn-
ish in the top ﬁve.”

The relay team will also'face

' some good teams, but if they‘:-un

their best they couldp lace.’ Vil-
lanova, Army, Navy, and Notre
Dame will be the hardest teams
to ‘beat. However there will be
ﬁne individual performers from
the other teams entered.

IM Mat Tourney.‘
Scheduled to Start
Next Thursday

Intramural director" Leo Bemis
has set next Thursday as the
date ‘for the all-university in-
tramural wrestling championships.
The meet is scheduled to start
at 4:30 p.m. in the Fitzgerald
Field House wrestling room.

All participants must sign-up
and weigh-in at the Field House

.before the starting time.

Nine weight classes will be
contested. They are 123, 130, 137,
147, 157, 167, 177 and 191‘-pounds
and heavyweight. '

There will be a three ' pound
weight allowance in each class.
In other words, a wrestler weigh-
ing 126-pounds can enter the 123-
pound class. '

Bemis had hoped to run off the
tourney last week, but a lack
of entries forced its postponement.

There will be a meeting of all
candidates for the Panther golf
team Monday at 4 p.m. in the
Fitzgerald Field House Confer-
ence room. All candidates are
requested to be present.

loss was to Navy in .a disputed .

When the EIGL“ individual
championships get underway
at Penn State this afternoon

the Panthers will be seeking
their first individual title since
Earl McConnell won the free
exercise in 1962. Unfortunately.
their chances will be mighty slim.

Coach Warren Neiger took his
entire regular lineup with him,
but admittedly h_e’s not expecting
too much. “I felt that I had to take
at least our top six performers,”
he said. “1f=,I took any fewer it
would be hard to even consider
ourselves a team.”

Ed Stim and _John Franchuk are
the only Panthers given much of
‘a chance of placing. Stim, who
competes in ﬁve events, has the
best chance of placing on the
parallel bars or the long horse.
Franchuk will enter in the paral-
lel bars, where he has scored over
nine on a number of occasions
this season.

Today won't bevthe ﬁrst -time
that Neiger has been forced to
relay on one or two perform-
_ers. ' Since 1960 only six Pan-
thers have placed in Easterns
‘and there have never been more
than two in any one season.
4’-Last year the Panthers managed
to cop three places. At that time
Jack Lehner placed fourth on the
long horse while Ed Zamecnik
picked up "a fourth and a ﬁfth in
the all-around and parallel bars
“respectively” -

ed for team honors, —Neiger did
comment on which squads he felt
would make the _best showing.
“Temple has a number of out-
standing boys,”' he stated. “They
ﬁnished the season undefeated
and" I’d have to say that they’re
certain to take their share of
places.”

Another team that is sure to
make a‘ good showing is the
host squad, Penn State. State
ﬁnished second in the EIGL and
the battle between their star
Pete_ Saponoro and Syracusc’s
Sid Oglesby for top honors on
the long horse highlight the
afternoon, Soponoro was the
only to defeat Ogelsby during
the regular seasonand is unde-
feated.

‘Panthers Await
NIT Committee

Coach Bob Timmons and the
Panther basketball team continue
to play the waiting game. Un-
til the NIT selection committee
gets around to chosing four more
teams for the tournament, there
isn’t much the team can do.

“Right now we’re just going
over the fundamentals and rest-
ing up,” said Timmons. “When
we do ﬁnd out who we will play,
then we’ll begin concentrating
on certain aspects.” .

Despite the recent loss to Penn
State, there is still an outside
chance that the Panthers will be
seeded in the NIT. Their chances
were enhanced Tuesday night
when NYU lost to Rider College,
66-63. It seems as if DePaul with
a 20-2 record and the second-
place ﬁnisher in the Missouri
Valley Conference are certain to
be seeded.

NYU has to play St. John’s
tomorrow. If they win, they will
probably earn one of the top four
spots. The committee will prob-
ably take into account that the
tournament is being played on
NYU’s,, home court, Madison
Square Garden. -

The Alpha Phi Alphas, Pi
