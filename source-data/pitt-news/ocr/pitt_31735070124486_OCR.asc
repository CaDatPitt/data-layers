For freshmen ‘at Pitt, Cardiac Hill may mean

But it has not always been that way. it

Pitt revamps Web site

MREHAN NASIR
Editor in Chief

/

Thousands of helpful Web sites are
available everyday to students, from
online textbooks to ‘trip planning and
sports information. But for Pitt students,
the best may be the University’s own
Pitt.edu site. 4 ’ _

The site recently changed _to include
brighter colors and larger pictures. It also
has simpler links and category names for
easier navigation. _ ' A

“The Web site is a work in progress,”
said Robert Hill, executive director of
public affairs at‘Pitt.

He said the site has been under con-
struction since October.

Students are able to look up almost
anything Pitt-related on the site, from
faculty names and e-mail addresses to
links to Pitt sports. ‘Information about
housing and food services is also online,

along with the complete University fact V

books from the past four years.

Hill saidvthat a -committee from the
provost’s office had been selected to look
at the old site and suggest improvements.

“We looked at quite a few other uni-
versities,” said John Cooper, the Web-
master for the_ site. “That way we got a

' sense of what did and didn’t wor .”

Pitt’s ofﬁce of public affairs handled
the site’s content and added news head-

lines and events on the top of the home
page. To clearly identify the site as Pitt’s,
the blue and gold were darkened and a
larger seal and photo of the Cathedral of
Learning were used. Many of the photos
on the site have also been updated, and a
virtual campus tour can be taken online.

Halo Technologies from Pittsburgh
is helping Pitt with part of the site,
including template ‘creation for the grad-
uate recruitment sections.

Jinx -Walton and Brian Hart from
Computing Services and Systems
Development handled the technical

aspects of the new site, including putting

the new site online. CSSD will a1so.han-
dle the server maintenance.

Hill said that although the new site
was planned to be unveiled this past
spring, the committee was delayed

because of the time it took to get a con-.

sensus from all the parties involved. 4'

The old site has been up since; 1996'
and rarely changed, according to Cooper. 4 '
“Now that the new site is "under [pub- 5

lic affairs], we’ll be able to keep it up
with emerging technologies. Obviously
it’ll evolve along with everything else,”
he said. 1 * A

Cooper added that student 

may soon be seeing content management

.V software that will make their sites: easier ._
to update and maintain. Templates and

graphics may also become availa_ble*_to
student groups. ‘ , _- v

“We’d like to get the students

down there pretty early so they can
participate in some of the pre—game
activities that have been planned,”
Morgan said. 2

Pitt’s shuttleswill drop students
off between Gates A and B and pick-

’ 0 up will be at Gates C and D. The

“entrance to the student section will be
through Gate B. '
Morgan said that in a given loop
of buses, about 2,200 students could
be transported. He is expecting that
the number of students will increase
as the season goes on, and expects a
large crowd for the Penn State game.
In addition to Pitt’s shuttles, stu-
dents may also take advantage of free
fare on Port Authority Transit buses
and head Downtown before the game.
From Market Square, students can
reach Three Rivers by walking to
Point State Park and following the
stadium walkway: » _.
PAT is also offering buses which

have specific routes from the Strip "

District and South Side to the stadi-
um. The 96B will serve the South
Side and the 96D will go to the Strip.

Other buses‘ will also be available for

Pittsburgh’s outskirts, including
Monroeville, Pleasant Hills, Upper

’ .St. Clair and Coraopolis. Students

can pick up schedules for those buses
in the William Pitt Union or on PAT’s
Web site at www.ridego1d.com. _

’ Another alternative for students is
to head to Station Squareand pay $5

for a round-trip ride on" the Gateway V

Clipper. The boat will leave about
three hours before kickoff and begin
returning passengers at the start of the
fourth quarter, continuing until a half

A -9 hour after the end of the game.

5

After the games, Pitt’s shuttles
/will run for approximately two more
hours. Students may also want to
walk back through Downtown and
onto a PAT bus. Cards outlining all
, possible ways back to campus will be

‘:9 available’ at the game to help stu-

dents.

chalking cars is not the answer

to Oak|and’s parking problem

Most of us car owners are very

‘protective of our dear autos. We talk to ‘

our cars, give them names and wash
them lovingly on a serni-regular basis.

. And usually we don’t like it when

strangers touch them.

So at ﬁrst glance the Oakland
Business Improvement Dist1ict’s initia-
tive of chalking tires on cars parked at
meters seems a bit invasive. According
to this plan, the chalking is necessary so
that the Pittsburgh Parking Authority
can check up on the cars to make sure
that people are. not extending the time
limits ‘by, feeding the meters.

, While the idea of someone com-
ing at your car with a stick of white
powdery stuff when you haven’t even
done anything wrong is not desirable, it
isforgivable. Chalk washes off. What’s
worse about this initiative is that it’s a
short-term solution at best, and not a
very good one at that.

‘OBID’s,intention, it seems, is to
prevent people from using the meters

. as all-day parking spots in an effort to

free up more space for shoppers and
restaurant patrons. But it seems doubt-

, ful that the chalking will really solve I

the problem.
Picture the scenario — your meter
has expired, your tires are chalked and,

_ not knowing where else to park, you

are very sad and desperate. As the tears
of frustration begin to fall, lo and
behold, you spot another parking spot‘

across the street and back a few feet.
You artfully maneuver into the space,
pop in your quarters" and revel in your
parking security until the drama begins
again in two hours. .

Thus parking in Oakland becomes
a big rollicking game of musical chairs,
in which spots are never actually freed
and everyone is hassled.

There is one obvious long-term
solution to this problem — more park-

«ing lots and garages in Oakland. Over

the past few years, Pitt seemed to pri-
oritize building more student housing.
It’s time for that focus to shift to creat-
ing more parking space. .

The Multipurpose Academic
Complex on Forbes Avenue, currently
under construction, is,being built to
include a sub-ground parking garage.
This will certainly help but won’t be
enough. More drastic and potentially
expensive measures may be requisite
— i.e., building multiple layers above
or below the parking lot situated
between the Hillman and ‘Carnegie
libraries, or razing a few decrepit hous-
es in South Oakland. ’ —

It remains to be seen as to whether
OBlD’s plan will actually increase
business; yet it can be certain that the
scheme  multiply headaches and
frazzled nerves ‘in many a driver. OBID

and Pitt, either independently or jointly, .

should begin investigating the ‘afore-
mentioned permanent solutions.

Gay cohimunity must reject
anti-Christian bigotry

“Christians are evil!” _ .

I was taken aback when, a few years ago, my
friend Sean blurted out that statement over lunch.
Being a‘ ‘gay man, Sean was keenly aware of the
fact that many Christians selectively quote from
the Bible in an attempt to justify anti-gay bigotry.
But his statement was an unfair generalization,
and I called him ‘on it. We got into a heated argu-
ment, and ended up not speaking to -
each other for some time.

Ironically Sean, in generalizing
all Christians as anti-gay bigots,
himself engaged in prejudicial
stereotyping. That type of rhetoric is
wrong, no matter the target. ‘

A further irony of Sean’s statement is that
many out—and-proud lesbians and gay men are
devout practicing Christians.-More_over, many of
these gay Christians are passionate and articulate
crusaders for the gay rights movement.

I met one of these exemplary gay Christians

. way back in the spring of 1989, when I was an

undergraduate student at the State University of
New York at Buifalo. Darlene Gamer, who at
that time served on the Philadelphia rnayor’s
Commission on Sexual Minorities, was invited

I that semester to speak at my school as part of our

Black History Month program.

Gamer — a black lesbian mother and grand-
mother as well as a Christian clergywoman ——
made a powerful impression on me and the other
students. One of the interesting comments she

. made was that she was bothered by the presence

of ecclesiophobia —— a fear of churches and reli-
gion — within the lesbian and gay community. ‘

To a degree, such ecclesiophobia is under-
standable. After all, when anti-gay religious big-
ots such as Gary Bauer and Pat Robertson spend
so much time hogging the media spotlight,’it can
sometimes seem like Christianity and homopho-
bia are hopelessly intertwined.‘

But as Gamer noted that evening in Buffalo,

misguided Christians have also attempted to‘

yoke white supremacy, male chauvinism and

— other evils to their religion. Like today’s anti-gay

religious bigots, those racistsand sexists should
be recognized for what they are — perverters of
a potentially liberating gospel message.

Gamer had received her ministerial creden-
tials through the Metropolitan Community
Church (http://www.ufmcc.com), and at the time
of this writing serves on that -denominations
board of elders. I wish that those lesbians and gay
men who have suffered the wrath of
religious homophobia could learn
of the wonderful work of this
church. Founded in 1968 by the
Rev. Troy Perry, the Metropolitan
Community Church is a Christian
denomination with a special ministry to lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgendered people. Many
same—sex couples have had their unions blessed
by clergy from this institution over the years.

Of course, heroic gay Christians can be _

found in all of the major denominations. One
individual whom I particularly admire is John
McNeill, the openly gay Catholic priest and ther-
apist. His 1976 book “The Church and the
Homosexual” is considered a classic work in the
canon of pro-gay‘ Christian literature.

And that canon continues to grow every
year. I believe that books such as Carter
Heyward’s “Touching Our Strength,” Gary
David Cornstock’s “Gay Theology VV1thout
Apology”. and Nancy W1lson’s “Our Tri ”
could go a long way toward reducing both eccle-
siophobia in the gay community and homopho-
bia in the Christian community.

I believe that there is still a degree of tension '

between the gay community as a whole and the
Christian world as a whole. But committed gay
Christians like Garner are working to bring down
the walls that artiﬁcially divide people. And I
hope that this prophetic witness will be heard by
people of all religions and sexualities.

Mike Mazza would like to dedicate this to his
ﬁiends at the Metropolitan Community Church

THE Pin News

Wronrasonv, Auausr 30, 2000

Religion and politics have an important symbiotic’ relationship

When the Christian Coalition became a
potent” political force in the early 1990s,
many spoke out against this new organiza-
tion. Although some criticized the Christian
Coalition’s politics directly, sadly most criti-
cisms relied on a twisted interpretation of the
First Amendment, an interpretation that
utterly separates religion ﬁom politics.

More appropriate criticisms would have
looked at the C policies’ backed by the
Christian Coalition, or more preferably at

. how those policies_ ran counter to biblical
teachings (best demonstrated by Rev. Jim
Wallis in his book “Who Speaks for God?”).
Too many Americans, especially those in the
media, seem to think we should not have
freedom of religion but rather freedomfmm
religion. Some .-—go so far as to say that politi-

 

cians should never arrive at their stances by
looking at the teachings of their faith — I, on
the other hand, would say more politicians
shouldlook at those teachings.

This viewpoint shows an utter lack of
understanding of American law. The First
Amendment, as Yale law professor Stephen
Carter shows in “The Culture of Disbelief,”
exists to allow for the protection of religion
from the state, rather ' than the opposite. It
also existsto protect minority religions in a
culture where those following the religion of
the majority may not respect their rights .— a
rule often violated, especially when it comes
to the religious rights of Native Americans.

The Supreme Court reaﬂirrned 
principle in 1946 when it stated that “state .

powerisnomoretobeusedsoastohandi—

cap religions than it is toifavor them.” Try

explaining that to the American Civil ,

Liberties Union andother libertarian groups,
whose goals include crippling religious free-
dom to the point where it becomes an entire-
ly private matter. -

As G.K. Chesterton point-
ed out six decades ago,
“Religious liberty might be i
supposed to mean that every-

allowed to mention it.” Even prominent sec-
ularists like Norman Lear have concluded
that their ideological allies have shut their
minds on the topic, refusing to allow for any

open discussion on it. ‘

If you travel north of Pittsburgh along, some back
roads for about 20 minutes, you may find Shaler High
School nestled in a small suburb of the city.

Traveling west of Pittsburgh for abouta half hour
along Route 51 and OhioRiver Boulevard, you might run

into Quaker Valley High School.

Ifyou’re on the Pitt men’s soccer team, you call those

two places home.

Wlﬂl the destruction of Pitt Stadium, the men’s soc-
cer team will be forced to play nine home games away

from Oakland.

Head coach Joe Luxbacher will have 16 of 22 letter- 1
winners returning from a 7-9-3 season a year ago. ‘
Of the seven wins, however, only one was earned in

the Big East Conference.

Pitt’s 1-8-2 conference record matched l998’s out-
put, which was its worst since 1991, when the Panthers

were winless in eight league contests.

Gone from last year’s team is midﬁelder Reagan
Bender, who had two goals and two assists last year in 19
games. Also gone is Travis Kruse, a defender, who tallied
twice in 14 games, including a game-winner-.

The top returning players for Pitt are senior midﬁeld-
ers Ben Garry and Chad Porter and senior forward

volleyball season to begin

FRAN AIELLO
The Pitt News

The Panthers volleyball team will
kick off an extended season at the
Carolina Fall Preview this weekend
under the direction of new head coach
Chris Beerman. -

Coming to Pittafter a successful stint
at James Madison University, Beennan
increased the _number of opponents to 31.
The Panthers played 22 contests in 1999.

He replaces Cindy Alvear, who
retired at the end of last season to move
to Texas with her husband and pursue
missionary work. ,

Beerman and his assistant, Kim
Kumfer, formerly an American
University assistant coach, have worked
diligently over the summer months with
the women to prepare them for the sea-
son.

“We have four returning seniors this
year that are going to be very hungry,”
Beerman said.

Stacy Renick, who had 1.95 kills and
1.75 digs per match last year, and Marcia
Theisen, who averaged 2.41 kills and
3.12 digs per match, return as outside hit-
ters.

Jennifer Nickels, a Huddle hitter,
averaged 2.14 kills and 0.79 blocks last
year. The fourth retuming senior is setter
Lisa Riggle, who averaged 12.62 assists
in six matches after recovering from a
shoulder injury sustained last preseason.

These four offer a veteran base to a
team that includes two sophomores and
four freshmen.

Renick and Theisen will be joined in
the outside hitter position by freshmen
Wendy Hatlestad, April Puzauskas and
Megan Miller. . j '

Nickels will be aided by junior trans-
fer Heather Haff from Kansas State as
well as by sophomore Dionne Hayden.
Beerman said Haff had eamed the start-
ing nod. ‘

Panthers and Steelers are
wallowing in mediocrity

I’ve only been a senior one day,

so it’s probably a little too early to

reminisce about the football I’ve..seen
in Pittsburgh, but here goes.
During my freshman year, I wit-
nessed the Pitt football
team, led by Pete
Gonzalez, beating a
nationally ranked
Miami team and go on
to the Liberty Bowl.
And last semester
Pitt Stadium came down,
but not before the football

 
 
 
  
    
  
   
  

in the last game played there.

That’s about it. 

When I came to Pittsburgh, I
realized it was a football-crazy
town, but the craziness never
reached its full potential because
there hasn’t been a whole lot to cheer
about. 1 4 _

arrival, have continued to fall further

Spencer Barton. Garry led the Panthers in
scoring in 1999, with seven goals and 16
points. Porter added four goals last year
and Barton had three. ‘

Garry has 12 career goals‘ and is six
away from tying for 10th on Pitt’s all-time
list. He is already tied for ninth in career
assists with 11.

Luxbacher, who is also Pitt’s all-time
leader in goals with 37 and tied for first in
points with 84, said that Garry will be the
main offensive threat for the Panthers. 

Joining Garry and Porter as midﬁeld-
ers are brothers Nate and ‘Tim
Montgomery, junior Mark Sikora, redshirt
senior Andrew Light, sophomore Bryan
Hopper and redshirt sophomore Jorge
Rivera. 1

Everyone but Rivera saw action for
the Panthers in 1999, adding quality depth
to the scoring attack.

Barton will have two juniors joining
him in Peter Veltri and Mike Butler as for-
wards, along with redshirt sophomore
Josh Whitham. _

The defense will be the least experi-
enced position, with redshirt senior Keith
Blass, redshirt sophomore Toure Weaver,
and sophomore Miles Dowiak as the top
returnees. ,

One of the new additions to the team
is redshirt‘ junior Chris Churchill, who
transferred to Pitt from cross,-state rival
Penn State. '

The team’s only freshman, Clay

‘Haﬂich, will also be a member of the

defense corps, and "should contribute
immediately.
The starting goalkeeper position was

one that had no question marks attached as
the preseason drew to a close. Sophomore
Justin Gaul returns after starting all 19
games as a true freshman last year. He

posted a 1.10 goals against average and p

six shutouts.
Gaul needs justone more shutout to

tie Kirk Brodows and Ronald Goga for.

10th on Pitt’s all—time list.

Backing up Gaul will be redshirt
sophomore Joe Conlan, who recorded 22
shutouts inhis last two seasons at Strath
Haven High School. .

The Panthers open the season at
Bucknell on Friday, and the home opener
is Sept. .13 against Duquesne at Shaler.

Pitt has only made two appearances in
the Big East postseason tournament in 15
years, the last coming in 1995, when the
Panthers reached the ﬁnal before losing to
St. John’s. ’

VOLLEY

will start for the Panthers. Norris was
named to the Big East All—Rookie team
last year after posting 12.39 assists per
match.

Alexandra Lacenere will serve as a
defensive specialist, subbing in when the
other team is serving.

The team will compete at the Carolina
Fall Preview against East Tennessee State
and North Carolina on Friday. The follow-
ing day, Pitt will square off against Hofstra
and Coastal Carolina, beginning the sea-
son with a challenging four—game week-
end.

“We’re not going to be mediocre any-
more,” Beerman said. “A winning mental-
ity combined with the physical size and

watch.”

Beerman also said he wants the team
to attain a higher level of intensity. Pitt will
be pamcipating in ﬁve tournaments over
the course of the season, starting this
weekend and ending with the Southwest
Missouri State Mary Jo Wyrm Invitational
on Oct. 13-14.

T wenty-one of the 32 matches are on
the road, which Beerman admits might be
diﬁicult for the team, but he remains con-
ﬁdent. ,

The team’s hunt for the Big East
Championship will also be a little tougher
this year. There are only four spots in the
championship tournament, down two
from last year.

This means that Pitt will have to be
among the top four teams at the end of the

‘regular season to qualify.

“Basically we want to compete hard

and win,” Beerman said. “North Carolina,
Utah State and Xavier all stand as tough
opponents, but should all be exciting
games.”

“The team is fun to watch and good
under pressure,” Beerman said. “If we
win, people are interested in coming to the
games.” S

Beerman was a two—time Colonial
Athletic Association Coach of the Year in
his four-year tenure with James Madison.
He led the Dukes to their ﬁrst—ever NCAA
appearance and four straight winning sea-
sons.

Under his tutelage, James Madison
went 90-36 overall with a 35-7 mark in the
CAA. _ '

“ 'tt volleyball has a long—standing
championship tradition and I am excited
to lead the program back to the top of the
Big East and beyond,” Beerman said.
