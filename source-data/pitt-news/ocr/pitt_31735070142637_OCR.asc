SGB candidates spend hundreds on campaigns

New Election Code restricts candidates’ purchases

Simone Cheatham
Staff Writer

The passage of the new Student Gov-
ernment Board Elections Code last
month took away one incentive for
people to vote: free food.

Gone too are the days when can-
didates could buy ﬂowers for every
sorority on campus.

“We used to buy each sorority half
a dozen oftheir ovvnﬂowers and have
ribbons of their colors tied around the
stems,” SGB President Kevin Morri-
son said. “That alone cost everyone
$300, but if the other candidates were
doing it, you would be’ hosed if you
didn’t.”

SGB decided to change its Election
Code in an effort to lower campaign
costs and reduce paper waste during

the campaign.

SGB doesn’t require candidates to
keep official records ofhow much they
spend on their campaigns, so in the
past, some candidates spent hundreds
of dollars trying to get elected. Board
member Lance Bonner estimated that
candidates spend between $300 and
$700 each on their campaigns.

“We don’t have to record our
spending, and we don’t have any

said. “It just seems unnecessary, so
we don’t do it.”

Much of that money came out of
the candidates’ own bank accounts.

“I knew there wasa ﬁnancial com-
mitment going in,” Board member
Max Greenwald said. “It’s not about
spendingas much moneyas possible.

cut down on ways that students

Charlie Shull '— United Pitt slate

Charlie Shull wants to use his experi-
ence as a leader in other University orga-
nizations, such as Interfraternity Council
and Pitt Mock Trial, to show students he’s
ready to be SGB president. '

A 21-year-old senior, Shull is ﬁnishing
his degree in politics and philosophy and
obtaining a minor in legal studies.

Shull was born in Easton, Pa., but

considers Pittsburgh his home. Shull is
a member of the first generation in his
family to attend college.

Shull joined the judicial committee of
SGB during his freshman year. Throughout
his years at Pitt, he has also been involved
with Panther Grappling and the Spanish
Club. He is a former business manager of

Pitt Mock Trial. He joined Kappa Sigma-

and served‘ as social chair before becoming
vice president of judicial affairs and then

president of the Interfraternity Council.
Since Shull has been president of the
IFC, the group has seen a membership
increase of 65 percent and has started
an endowment fund. In 10 semesters, IFC
plans to raise $50,000. .
Shull servedpon SGB’s judicial commit-

_ tee during his freshman year. He ran for a

position on the Board his sophomore year
but lost. He’s served as a Board member
for the past year.

plishment is organizing the Symplicity
website. The website, which should begin

working this spring, will allow students to '

streamline their organizations by creat-

and having constant communication with
SGB, Shull said. .

Shull said he wants students to know

that he promised Symplicity and followed

through, but that it’s not the sole aspect
of his platform.

Being president, he said, “is about be-
ing a representative for the undergraduate-
student body.”_ ,

Shull said he thought the current
Board worked to improve the group’s
relationship with administrators, por-
traying itself as serious, professional and
competent. However, he said the Board
needs to continue to focus on improving
its relationship with students as well as
administrators.

Romeo commended Shull on the
Board’s forums and hearingsfor students
during the G—20 Summit. Romeo, how-
ever, believes the communication between
students and SGB. needs to improve.

WPTS loses
Woodie

Radio station ﬁnishes in top five
Staff Report

Pitt’s student—run radio station, WPTS,
missed out on top honors for this year’s
Woodie Awards.

MtvU announced Monday that a student
radio station in Washington won the Col-
lege Radio Woodie, an award recognizing
pioneering college radio stations.

KUPS 90.1 FM, from the University of
Puget Sound, in Tacoma, Wash., will re-
ceive its honor at the Woodie Awards in
New York City on Dec. 4.

MtVU named WPTS one of the top five
collegiate radio stations in the United
States. -

Nate Hanson, the station’s engineering
director, said it was an honor to make the
top five. ..

“You can’t be upset with anyone for put-
ting you in a category of excellence with
such a small number of radio stations,”
he said.

Pitt students had the opportunity to
vote for WPTS online before mtvU made

_ its decision.

to make sure you have as much opportunity as

This year, candidates can spend money on
six items: barmers, posters, fliers, T-shirts and
quarter-page and glossy quarter-page ads in
The Pitt News.

Morrison said SGB changed the code to
reduce not only spending but paper waste as
well, an idea stemmingfrom the “Paperless Pitt”
initiative.

Many candidates set up free online Facebook
groups and ads promoting their ideas. The new
Elections Code also limits flyering. Candidates
can now hand out ﬂiers only the day before and
the day of the election. Last year, candidates
could pass out fliers the week before the elec—
tion.

“Fliers don’t do much,” Greenwald said.
“They’re really ineffective, but you feel like you
have to compete.”

Editorial

Obama, nation

underachieve

ell, Mr. President, it was
W good while it lasted. But
this week transformed

our patient, moon—eyed gaze into
an expectant glare. The trip across
Asia demonstrated the United States’
declining global inﬂuence, and that
does not leave much optimism for
domestic matters.

When voters, including many
college students, elected President
Barack Obama, many thought they
were creating the Utopian States of
America. The new USA would bring

health care to all citizens, regain lost ’

prestige on the world stage and sum-
mon Captain Planet to save a wheez-
ing Earth.

One year later, the Magic 8 Ball
says, “Outlook not so good.”

Today is the 146th anniversary
of President Abraham Lincoln’s
Gettysburg Address. If Obama ever
wants to scratch the legacy of his
presidential idol, he needs to work
a little harder.

The United States has waning
clout overseas, and, both domesti-
cally and internationally, Obama has

been deﬂated on issue after issue — P

but never worse than this week in

China.

He foolishly snubbed the Dalai
Lama in hopes of setting a good tone
for negotiations with Chinese presi-
dent Hujintao. According to The New
York Times, Obama avoided contact

with “Chinese liberals, free press ad-

vocates and even average Chinese.”

These are the acts of a president
who knows the United States does
not have much leverage left. Yet for
all these concessions, Obama did
not get any tangible results from his
talk with Jintao. Realistically, China
doesn’t have to give the United States
anything, because the United States
owes China a lot of money for two
wars, bailouts, stimuli, tax cuts and
more. The national debt at press
time was $12 trillion, according to
U.S. Debt Clock.

Earlier in the week, Japan called
for “more equal” relations with the
United States and a relocation of Ma-

rines stationed  Okinawa.
Meanwhile, Obama admitted that

the Guantanamo Bay prisoner facil-

ity will not be closed byjanuary, his

- original deadline for closure. Iran is

now refusing to send uranium abroad
for enrichment, defying a deal nego-
tiated with the United States. Israel
is ignoring the White House and ex-
panding settlements, and senators
in Obama’s own party are planning
to block debate on health care.

The one thing Obama and world
leaders agreed upon was that they
wouldn’t agree on anything bind-
ing at the upcoming United Nations
Climate Change Conference in Co-
penhagen.

It’s been a bad year.

Obama is losing prestige fast —
the Gallup daily tracking poll shows
that his approval rating dropped
from 68 percent in January to 50
percent currently. This is going to
make every policy objective much’
harder to accomplish.

However, the blame cannot be
placed solely on Obama. He can’t sign
legislation that Congress doesn’t send
to  The debts and obligations
were run up before his inauguration.
The United States has been getting
weaker — a decline exacerbated by
an exhausted military and lingering
recession — and now other countries

are piling on. .

Considering Obama was handed
the Oval Office keys with a roll of duct
tape, he is doing an adequate job.

A bigger problem is that student
voters got hyper—hoped. We over-
dosed and now we’re crashing.

Obama’ promised many lofty
accomplishments in a short time
span, and such massive progression
was never ‘going to happen imme-
diately. Citizens should not be mad
that Obama is breaking promises,

but much like the moral in a “West '

Wing” episode, they should be mad
that Obama made promises he could
never keep.

And anyone who believed the
campaign rhetoric.should be mad -
at themselves for falling for it.

Prevailing wage stifles growth

Purportecl to bring fairness, a prevailing wage would reduce employment '

Mason Herron
Columnist

    
 

* The Pittsburgh City Council intro-

duced legislation on Tuesday that
would"‘require contractors who
provide building and food servic-
es to the City of Pittsburgh to pay
prevailing wages to employees.”
This legislation, if passed, would
increase governmental costs and
unemployment while reducing the
amount ofmuch-needed develop-
ment in Pittsburgh.

According to the proposed
legislation, developers who wish
to do businesswith the city must
pay their employees with’ wages,
beneﬁts and time off that are equal
toor greater than the average of-
fered ‘within Pittsburgh.

In addition, building service,
food service, hotel and grocery
employees must be paid the
prevailing wage “for all work
performed on or related to proj-
ects that are receiving or 'have
received” a subsidy from the
city. According to“ the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, earlier this year

council president Doug Shields
said, “whether they’re owners or
tenants, those businesses should
have to pay their workers enough
money so they’re not eligible for
food stamps or the state’s‘Child
Health Insurance Program.”

66%

 [Prevailing wages]
would increasecosts for
a city government that
already faces a budget ‘
shortfall. ‘

_ Proponents of this legislation
argue that the measure would
bring fairness to the labor mar-

'ket and invigorate the Pittsburgh

economy with increased wages.
This belief, however, is short-
sighted and imprudent.

' Much like minimum wages
laws, so-called “prevailing wage”

. laws, such as the Davis—Bacon Act

of 1931, have a detrimental effect
on employment.

Imagine, for example, a young A

Oakland resident whose skills are
valued at $10 per hour. In this sce-
nario, a developer building a park
would be pleased to employ our
Oakland resident, who is more
than happy to accept the $10-
per—hou.r wage rather than face
unemployment. However, if the
average wage within the‘ city is

$30 per hour- for the same type l

of work, then this developer will
not hire our Oakland dweller, who
will then be unemployed.
Furthermore, this would in-
crease costs for a city government
that already faces a budget short-
fall. Often when the city wishes to
build _a park, bridge or any other
public good, they must pay a pri-
vate developer to do so. “
Ideally, the city would pay the
developer that offers‘ the cheap-

est service. Yet, if the city forces —

all developers to raise wages to
meet new standards, then operat-
ing costs will also increase. The

This isa short endorsement, be-

Joe Montana and Johnny Unitas.
None compares to
Dion Lewis by any

Underno circumstanceslshould
anyone refer to Lewis as “Dion.”
Dion is a ﬁne name, but someone
might think we were talking about
Deion Sanders, and it would be a
travesty of justice if an ounce of
Lewis’ praise goes to Deion Sand-
ers. We must hold the line and
only yell, “Go Lewis!” There are
no famous football players named

city will then have to foot the bill
and will essentially subsidize the
wage difference between the low-
er market—determined price and
the higher wage required by the
prevailing-wage legislation.

V The cost increases would not
stopthere. Each employer must
prepare a record for the city de-
tailing “the name, address, job
classiﬁcation, wages and beneﬁts
paid or provided and number of
hours worked for each employ-
ee.”

V Additionally, employers must
“ﬁle a statement eachweek with
the Controller or the Controller’s
authorized agent certifying that
all workers have been paidno
less than required by contract.”
This increase in gross—tonnage
of paperwork will undoubtedly
increase administrative and bu-

. reaucratic costs for a city already

unable to handle its current ﬁ-
nancial load.

far more reluctant to do business

onerous regulations that tie wages
to subsidies. Pittsburgh, after all,
is not geographically expansive.
Businesses that wish to develop
need merely to travel the short
distance to Pittsburgh’s suburbs
outside of the city’s jurisdiction
where they may conduct business

 

This legislation is
the worst kind of
liberalism 

‘mg,

with local governments that do
not dictate wages to developers.
The cons of this legislation far
outweigh the pros. One wonders,
“Why was it proposed?”
United Northside — an in-
terest group representing Pitts-P

i

HE ALL-YCPJU-CA.N—EAT VBUFFET. Lobstr no

burgh’s Northside — was “seeking
“prevailing—wage” standards that
would set minimum wages and
beneﬁts based on averages for cer-
tain types of jobs,” according to

the Pittsburgh City Paper. At that '

time, the organization “already
started discussing proposals with
council members, including coun-
cil president Doug Shields.” More-
over, the Post—Gazette reports,
“The legislation is backed by sev-
eral local unions that are expected
to speak out on its behalf.”

This legislation is the worst
kind of liberalism, and it reeks of
interest—group politics as opposed
to reform politics. The latter aims
to elevate society as a whole, not
just a particular segment that car-
ries inﬂuence over votes.

Umphrey’s McGee takes audience requests to foster intimacy at live shows

Umphrey’s McGee

Allages welcome

Thereareself-irnportantbands, and
then there are honest bands.

When asked ifhis band had along-
term plan from the beginning, Ryan
Stasik, bassist of the Chicago—based
Umphrey’s McGee, showed how well
his band ﬁt into the latter category.

“[Our purpose for the band] was
twofold,” Stasik, a Pittsburgh native,
said. “Itwas deﬁnitely for beer money
and then world domination’?

It’s safetosayUmphrey’s McGeehas
at least the former goal locked up.

Afterforminginthe late ’90s atthe
University of Notre Dame, the band
members quickly established them-
selves as pioneers in the e>q)erimental

fringe of the jam-band scene.

Rolling Stone dubbed the group
“the next Phish,” and The New York
Times called it “one of the best” jam
bands.

The bestpartaboutitis its members
didn’t even have to starvefor it.

“We’ve just been avery happy and

S - successful ban ,” Smsik said.

The band’s appeal seems to stem
fromtwothings—itscarefreedisposi-
tionand its musicalcapability, wbichis
a particularly nuanced knowledge of
instruments that it regularly exploits
during albums (most recently, the
critically—acclaimed Mantis) and live
shows. ,

“Whenyou’ve lived together, when
you’ve traveledtogether and sleptinone
hotel room or avan — and now, a bus
—— there’s alot ofmtangibles that come

' to craﬂing your skills,” Stasik said.

Improvisation andawillingness to
delve headﬁrst into unwrittenterritory
is the staple ofUmphrey’s McGee.

This is especially true of its live
shows, which take an alternative take

on what you’ll ﬁnd in the albums.

“We have the type of personalities,
thetypeofband, thatifwe hadtogo out
and play our hit single for the encore
and the same 10 songs every night,

'we’d probably f‘*‘*king shoot ourselves

in the head,” Stasik said. ‘The improv

is what keeps it interesting, keeps us /

sane, keeps us challenged.” »

To prove this,‘ Umphrey’s McGee
hascraftedanewtooltoletthe audience
decide what it will play next. It’s called
the StewArt Series, or the S2.

“We thought it would be a really

hands on, intimate experience for the
fans,” Stasik said.

Separatefrom its regularconcerts, '

the S2 shows are an experiment infan-
band interaction.

How can you tell when a band_

is about to hit it big?

Does something in its sound
change that makes it just click?

Or is it just something that hap-
pens that can’t be explained?

Like any other band on the verge
of making it, Minus the Bear is try-
ing to ﬁgure this out. V

For the past eight years, the
Seattle-based band has hovered
around the indie-rock scene try-

ing to hit it big —— and lwithrthe
release of its new album in early
2010, the band believes it might
ﬁnally happen.-

Minus the Bear formed in
2001, when bassist Cory Murchy

and drummer_Erin Tate moved .

to Seattle and met guitarist Dave
Knudson through his former re-
cord promoter.

.The trio eventually recruited

keyboardist/sequencer Alex Rose A

and vocalist/guitarist Jake Snider
through mutual friends.

“We all grew up hearing what
our older siblings were listening
to, stuff like Metallica and The Cure

and Kiss for me,’.’ Tate said of the

band’s shared love of music. “We’re
inﬂuenced by things all over the

. board, everything from Slayer to

R. Kelly.”
But Tate can’t begin to deﬁne
the band’s sound.

The top 10 Beatles
covers of all time

Kelsey Shea scoured the Internet to bring you this list

Covering songs written by “the band that
changed rock ’n’ roll” is a  task but has
remained a wildly popular phenomenon for the
lastfour decades. ~ - A -

Accordingto secondhandsong.com, a cover V
song database, The Beatles areunsurprisinglythe »_

No. 1 covered artist of all time.

The site has almost 3,200 covers on ﬁle, and ‘

there areundoubtedly thousands oflesserknown

Consideringthe overwhelmingvolume of cov-
ers outthere, thereareboundtobe some greatad-
aptations aswellas some horriﬁc bastardizations
ofBeatles classics (William Shatner’s “Lucy inthe

“Across the Universe” featured afewsolid cov-

Thus, after much contemplation, You'I‘ube

' my personal top 10 favorite Beatles covers.

1o.)BenHarper . _
“Strawberry Fields Forever”

Harperrecordedthis coverforthe soundtrack
of “I Am Sam,” and it leaked out of theaters onto

A “TheTonight ShowwithJayLeno”andthe radio.

I think I like Harper’s version because it’s a bit
cleaner, alitﬂejazzierthanthe original and overall
a solid cover of a Beatles favorite. g

9.)Sonic Youth
“Within You WithoutYou”

SonicYouth trades insitars for synthesizers in
its coverofGeorge Harrison’s“WithinYouWit.hout
You.” Despite its fuzz and distortion, the cover
manages to keep the Eastern feel of-Harrison’s

original.

8.) George Benson
“I Want You”

Benson’s cover oftheAbbey Roadtracktrans—
plants the song to a new genre and dresses it up
with some sexy jazz guitars, brass and Benson’s
smooth voice.

“Itgetspretty creative,” Stasiksaid, referencing
“Hall and Oats makingaporno”and“safesexpub-

‘‘ “l':.\/'ery one of us draws a blank every night,”
Stasik said. “But that’s part of the challenge and
the risk that we thrive on.”

Allthis——-the S2, the improvisation——couldn’t
have been accomplished if the band took itself
too seriously. ‘

Thankfully, Umphrey’s members have a pro-

pensity for mischief, especially Stasik.

Duringa concert injamaica, Stasikwalked onto

“I am a man of my word,” Stasik said. “I put it
on. They gave me, like, 700 bucks, which I gave
to charity.”

It’s moments like these that underscore the

mantra ofUmphrey’s McGee — make good music,
but don’t let it swell your ego.

Umphrey’s knows its fans, and it knows that,
morethananything, they’re justlookingfora good

“Well, rock ’n’ roll I guess. That’s a really
hard question to answer, but I think that’s a
good thing," he insisted. “Every band is differ-
ent and I think we just do our own thing.”

By mixing elements from ambient, techno
and indie rock, the members of Minus the

Bear developed an individual style that

, earned them an ever—growing fan base

ranging from young teens to middle-aged

. adults. 5

Beginning with Highly Reﬁned Pirates in
2002, Minus the Bear honed its indie-rock
sound by experimenting with different varia-
tionsof electronic styles.

“We will start out with something really
fast and up-tempo, and then the mood will
change and become very slow and mellow. It
all kind of changes,” Tate said of the band’s
variety. 2 V -

I Over the past eight years, Minus the Bear
slowly began to transition away from their
electronic roots to a more acoustic and re-
ﬁned sound. , I

' With the release of its 2008 EP, the aptly
titled Acoustics, Minus the Bear almost com-
pletely transitioned away from its initial
electronic-pop-style by reworking songs
from past, albums into acoustic composi-
tions. ,    V

“The industry changes,” Tate said. “We
started eight or nine years ago, it grows you
up. We’ve been around each other more. You
get to a point where youcan read each other.
You start to like things you didn’t like before,
and things you did like get old.”

‘According to Tate, the music became less
about the showiness of electronic music and
more about meaningful lyrics.

“There’s always a message to be heard,”
Tate said. “It reﬂects the period we were
going through in history.”

.On the band’s last full-length album,
Planet ofIce, released in 2008, Snider. saw
the growing public interest in the environ-

ment and wrote lyrics based on the impres- .

sions he got from that, Tate said.

“Jake is a lit major, so each song is like a
short story,” Tate said. “He is just inspired
by different things, anything, stuff you see
on the street.” ‘

As for the future, Tate’s not entirely sure —

where the band is headed.

“I don’t really know. I guess we hope we
sell albums. We all make a living off of mak-
ing music, so you hope to see some kind of
result. We’re doing this 11 months out of

' the year, you hope to make something off

of this,” Tate said.

 Women’s volleyball seeks NCAA berth‘

This weekend the team will play for the Big East title, which would qualify it for the NCAA Tournament

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
played 28 games this year, but now
its season success depends on its

last three.

This weekend’s Big East Cham-
pionship presents one ﬁnal chance
for the Panthers to meet two goals:
securing a Big Easttitle and advanc-
ing to the NCAA Tournament.

Three wins would get them

_ both.

“You play all year for seeding,
and it comes down to peaking at
the right time,‘ and winning three

in a row this weekend would be_
our eighth, ninth and 10th match .

we’ve won in a row,” Pitt head coach

- Diana Connor | SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
In his second year as Pitt’s volleyball coach, Toby Rens has led the Panthers to a No. 3 seed heading into
the Big East Championship. He has his eyes on an NCAA Tournament berth.

Toby Rens said. “We do that, we’re
conference champs, and we get the
automatic bid to the NCAA Tour-
nament.”

But the task Won’t be easy.

Pitt’s journey starts on Friday at
10 a.m. against South Florida. The
Panthers played one of their closest

- games this year against the Bulls,

winningas-2 match by scores of 21-

' 25, 25-22, 25-20, 22-25 and 15-9.

“South Florida is a very good
team, they run a little different
system than the rest of the league,
a 6-2,” Rens said.

The style, which puts more hit-
ters in the front row for Pitt to ac-
count for, makes South Florida a
little harder to defend, Rens said.

“The ﬁrst match, they came out
really aggressive, and we had a little
trouble adjusting to their system,”
he said. “It took us a little while to
get into a groove. Defensively we
had an excellent match because we
had one block in the ﬁrst set but
ended up-with 18 for the match.”

_ After South Florida, if Pitt beats
the Bulls and continues its quest
for a Big East crown, it must dis-
patch the Big East’s best teams. If
all games were decided by higher
seeding, Pitt would need to avenge

regular-season losses against,’
No. 2—seeded Cincinnati and No.
1—seeded Notre Dame to win the
tournament.

But, Rens said, being a higher
seed doesn’t necessarily guarantee
avictory, and this year he wants his
team to treat its next games just like
all of the regular-season ones.

“We just try to keep our ap-
proach the same whether We’re
the three, four, ﬁve, six or seven
seed,” he said. “Last year, ,1 think
we went into the tournament with...
the hope of doing well and winning,-
and this year I think it’s more of a
reality. There’s been more success
this year to really validate us be-
ing in the tournament and being
a contender.”

The Panthers’ players learned
the same lesson during the 2008
Big East Championship at Pitt. Last
year, Pitt came into the Big East
Championship, in front of a home-
town crowd, as the No. 7 seed, fac-
ing then—No. 2 seed Cincinnati. ._

The Panthers looked ‘over-
matched, falling into a 2-0 hole
by the break to an experienced
and talented Bearcats squad. But
the Panthers came out of halftime
ﬁghting and won three straight sets

Basketball season is in full swing
again. . ~

Less than 48 hours after de-

feating Binghamton, 71-46, the

Pitt men’s basketball team tips off '

against the Eastern Kentucky Colo-
nels today at 7 p. m. at the Petersen
Events Center.

“We got better [against Bing-

‘ hamton],” Pitt head coach Jamie
‘ Dixon said after the Panthers’ win.

“Now, we have a day to prepare for
Eastern Kentucky.” -

Eastern Kentucky (1-0) returns H

four of its top ﬁve scorers from
last year’s team, which went 18-13
andﬁnished ﬁfth in the Ohio Valley
Conference.

The Colonels may be Pitt’s
toughest defensive challenge so
far this season, as they put up im-
pressive numbers in their season-
opener. Five Colonels hit double
digits in the team’s 102-71 win over
West Virginia Wesleyan.

Eastern Kentucky made 17-of-
26 3-point attempts in the game. It
paced the Ohio Valley Conference
in shooting behind the arc last sea-
son, knocking down more than 40
percent of its shots from deep.

Similarly, Pitt’s shooters came

65

alive against Binghamton. Soph-
omore guard Ashton Gibbs, who
went without a 3-pointer in the

Colonels might be toughest opponents yet.

The men’s basketball team will defend its 2-0 record against the Eastern Kentucky Colonels tonight

22 points. t

games and his bad games,” Dixon

said. “Tonight, he shot well.”
. But Dixon said the team needs

‘ more than Gibbs’ offenseagainst

potent Eastern Kentucky.

“We need Ashton to play good?
defense too,” he said.

In both ends of the court, re-
bounding remains a concern of
Dixon’s.

“Rebounding is always a con-
cern for us, especially the long
rebounds,” he said. “We haven’t‘'

‘ ‘ been grabbing enough of those,

and we need to get our guards more
involved in them. We’re never satis-
ﬁed with our rebounding numbers
— they can always be better.”

Burgos and Fries

Brendon Jennings the

new Allen Iverson  

Jennings a more than adequate replacement

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

 

Last week I opined the fading career of Allen

-. Iverson. Since then, Iverson and the Memphis

Grizzlies have officially parted ways, agreeing
to a mutual termination of Iverson’s contract.
Though dismayed, it’s not as if I didn’t see
this coming.

An avid fan of the NBA and big-time scor-
ers, I was left searching for something to take
my mind off the departed A1. I didn’t have
to look far. The cure: Brandon Jennings, the
second coming of Iverson.

This past Saturday, in just his seventh ca- ‘

reer NBA game, the 20-year-old Jennings
dropped a ridiculous 55 points on 21 for 34
shooting‘ and seven for eight from 3-point
land. The rookie also chipped in ﬁve rebounds
and ﬁve assists.Jennings did all this without
scoring a single point in the ﬁrst quarter.
It’s the most a rookie has scored in a game
since 1968. _ ,

Jennings has a similar scoring prowess to
Iverson, but the comparisons don’t stop there.
They are similar in stature,«as Jennings is 6

_ feet 1 inch tall and 169 pounds while Iverson is

listed at 6 feet and 165 pounds. Both use their
handles to create space and take acrobatic

year before he was eligible to enter the NBA
Draft. He played one season with Lottomatica
Roma of the Euroleague for $1.65 million and
also had a deal with Under Armour worth an
additional $2 million. He averaged just 5.5
points and played 17 minutes a game.
Jennings was underwhelming, so coming

. into the Association, he had a lot to prove. .

Through the ﬁrst eight games of the year, he
averaged a robust 25.5 points and 35 minutes
per game. He is shooting 48 percent from

. the ﬁeld and 54 percent from beyond the '

are. I hate to say it, but Jennings might just
be better than AI. '-

In 1996, Iverson shot a paltry 41 percent
from the ﬂoor. Now Iverson was never a guy to

- shoot the lights out and since he always took

did not accomplish his rookie season.

Now, I realize it’s early, so I don’t want to

Jennings took anobscure root to the "N BA.

During his senior year of high school, Jen- .

Eastern Kentucky, however, might be
what Pitt needs — the Colonels ﬁnished
second to last in rebounding in their confer-
ence last year. i '

Sophomore forward Nasir Robin-
son stepped up on the rebounding front
against Binghamton, totaling 10 against

V the Bearcats. ‘

“Coach Dixon emphasizes for us to out-

rebound our opponents, and we weren’t

to win the match. and ﬁnish the upset.

It’s something Rens and the Panthers take
with them today.

“The biggest thing we take is the recol-
lection of what it took to get there. I think,
certainly, with the returningiplayers, they

, have the success winning last year and get-

ting to the semiﬁnal,” Rens said. “Kind of
building on the hunger is taking it one step
further and to play in the ﬁnals and one step
beyond that and win the ﬁnals.”

Pitt has a successful recent history in the
Big East tournament. From 1988 to 1996, Pitt
made every ﬁnals matchup, winning seven
titles. '

But the Panthers haven’t been back to the .

title game since 2004, when it lost to Notre
Dame. g

' Lucky for Pitt, Louisville has been a hos-
pitable host for it all season.

This year, Pitt made two separate trips to
the University of Louisville for a tournament
and a Big East tilt against the Cardinals. Com-
bined, Pitt is 3-1 in Louisville this year.

The Panthers dropped their only match
against Arizona (3-1) while winning matches
against Belmont (3-2), Wichita State (3-0)
and Louisville (3-2).

The success bodes well for Pitt  the Big

East Championship, which will be held in the
Kentucky Convention Center instead of Lou-
isville’s on-campus volleyball arena, where
Pitt won its regular-season games.

But /Rens still thinks familiarity can help

the Panthers. -

“In a way it feels a little bit like a home
away from home, having played four matches
in Louisville, going 3-1,” he said. “It’s some-
thing I hope we can tap into and build upon

that 3-1 record, hopefully we push it to 6-1 —

in Louisville.” '

 

doing that,” Robinson said. “I thought I did
a better job of boxing out and grabbing the
rebound.” '
Robinson averaged more than 30 min-
utes on the court per game. Only guards
Gibbs and Brad Wanamaker equal that play-
ing time. ' '
“He’s put up good numbers, and he’s
made some great plays,” Dixon said. “Na-
sir has unique talents that will be used for

getting guys shots.‘ Our team is evolving, and
Nasir is clearly a big part of it.” E

For Eastern Kentucky, juniorjustin Stom-
mes is the go-to Colonel. Stommes scored
28 points against West Virginia Wesleyan
in 29 minutes. , _-

Pittsburgh native Josh Taylor scored 19
points and added six rebounds in the game.
As a freshman, Taylor made a last—second
layup to propel the Colonels to the 2007

13,

Out-rebounding‘ opponents key in next game

NCAA Tournament. But he told the Rich-
mond Register this week that beating Pitt
on Thursday might top that moment.

In addition to serving as Taylor’s home-,
coming, the matchup against Eastern Ken-

. tucky continues the 2009 O’Reilly Auto Parts

CBE Classic. Regardless of the result against
the Colonels, Pitt will travel to Kansas City
to play Wichita State in the semiﬁnals on
Monday at 7:30 p.m.
