Reopens Discussions

The University Book Cen-
ter Committee met Wednes-
day to reopen discussions on
Book Center policies. The fol-
lowing issues will be discuss-
ed and resolved at future
meetings:

—What is the present status of
A u x i l i a r y Enterprises? The
Book Center? Who is assuming
the responsibility for managing
the Center?

—-Who owns the Book Center?
Will rent continue to be paid
TO THE University?

—Has the University adopted new
auditing procedures as recom-
mended by last years Book Cen-
ter Committee; e.g. recording
volume of sales to faculty and
staff, students and the public
separately. Averaging income
statements‘?

—Will the University be willing
to allow SG to have the Book
Center’s accounts audited by an
outside CPA?

—What effect will our state-related
status have on the present op-
eration and future expansion of
the Book Center?

—Book Return Policy—should op-
erate on the assumption that re-

gardless of why a student
changes his course selection,
the decision as to whether or
not he receives a refund — full
or 50 per cent—should depend
on the condition of the textbook,
not on the length of time. If the
student’s particular school has
seen fit to approve a course
change, the Book Center should
not be in a position to judge
whether or not a student is
dropping a course to comply
with his academic advance»
ment. Books should be refund-
ed no matter when they are re-
turned so long as the student’s
school approves the change.

——The University should employ
a managing consultant firm to
make a study of the Book Cen-
ter’s operation in order to im-
prove efficiency while at the
same time decreasing unneces-
sary expenses: staff numbers,
merchandising (slow moving
lines, etc. ).

—Fine Arts Book Room — to whom
does this service cater? Do they
operate at a loss? Should it be

haps Frick?

THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Friday, August 2, 1968

 

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

Women are proving to be their
own worst enemies. Those female
pioneers who are trying to im-
prove the political and economic
inequalities between In e n a n (1
women are finding themselves
stymied by members of their own
ranks. This is especially true when
it comes to social aspects.

The liberal opinions of three fe-
male members of the Pitt News
staff who appeared on a radio
show to discuss the problems ig-
nited a controversy among dis-
senting girls on campus.

One idea which caused a great
deal of comment involved the dat-
ing customs in the United States.

It was proposed that women ask
men out for dates and sometimes
foot the bill for the evening. This
reform was considered especially
applicable to the college com-
munity because male college stu-
dents are often hard up for cash
while many girls are working.

The idea that girls could take

the initiative in dating aroused
interested comments from both

- . men and WOIIIGII on campus.

 
   
   
   
 

era], the campus males
r the idea of women pay-
r the date once in a while.

ght that “it’s about time. I
nk women should pay. too. If
omen want to be equal in busi-
ness. they shouldn‘t just stop

I there?’

Most of the girls interviewed,
however, thought that it is “a ter-

 e Levension, a s 0 p h o m o r e,

rible idea.” “I don’t want things
to change,” said a sophomore co-
ed here. “I like it that a guy calls
me up to ask me out. I wouldn’t
want to do it.”

“Who wants to pay?” queried
another girl. “We’d be going to
Eat ‘n Park all the time.”

Although it is to be expected
that many girls will buck such a
seemingly disadvantageous equal-

ity, it is not possible for females _

to achieve equality in political
and economic. s p h e r e s without
some of it rubbing off onto the so-
cial sphere. This was another idea
proposed on the radio show ‘last
week.

Hank Bachman, host of th e
“College Forum” radio show, did
not think it possible for women to
be “soft and feminine and suc-
cessful in the cold, hard, world
of business at the same time.”

Rise Weinberg, a junior, agreed
She prefers that women remain
“soft and feminine” rather than
become equal. ‘TI don’t want to be
equal,” she moaned. “I want to be

. taken care of; I want the little

things that men do for women. I
think any man-woman relation-
ship should be 60-40, not 50-50. A
woman losses her feminity
when she is completely equal to
a man.”

On the other hand, “femininity”
is a nebulous term in itself. A
sophomore psychology major of-
fered that “femininity is only
what society decides it to be. It is
really only a superficial thing.”

Robert Abernethy, personnel
manager of the University, he-
lieves that “society assigns cer-
tain qualities to a woman. How-
ever, I think that there is a bio-
logical basis for some of it, such

as a woman’s physical weakness
in comparison to a man.”

The question inevitably extends
to sexual equality. The point was
raised by Richard Lazarus, doc-
tor of physchology at the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley, in
his book, Personality and Adjust-

ment. Dr. Lazarus wrote that the .

transition expected of the woman
from girlhood to marriage can be
psychologically damaging.

The American, according to the
socially-approved code of moral-
ity, must go from a state of s'e'xs~
ual ignorance to a meaningful
sexual relationship in marriage.

In contrast, women in a number
of the European countries do not
suffer from the double standard.
A case in point is Switzerland.
Claude B., a Swiss native ..now
working at Presbyterian Hospital,
revealed that his countrywomeri
have almost complete sexual free-
dom and “they’re very happy
about it.”

The crux of the problem appears
to lie in the amount of equality
that women are willing to accept.
American women want to achieve
political and economic equality

’ Women Want Social, Sexual Freedom

while retaining their social “ad-
vantages.”

Swiss women, on the other hand,
enjoy more social-sexual freedom
than Americans. However, Swiss
women have not yet gained the
right to vote. They are not making
an active effort to change this sit-
uation, either.

In the United States, the in-
creasing trend of female infiltra-
tion into business and the profes-
sions prove that American women

are attempting to fulfill their po- ,

tentials. Just what potentials will
be actualized, only time will tell.

One of the major recommenda-
tions that students will make to
the committee will be to improve

cedures in the Book Store. This
suggestion, pointed out by last
year’s committee, was not imple-
mented by the administration.

The committee will meet per-
iodically to map present and fu-
ture policies in the Book Store.

One possible solution agreed
upon by all the committee mem-
bers is formation of a student co-
op that would sell sweatshirts and
other profitable merchandise.

The committee is composed of
students, faculty, and administra-
tors. The students on the commit-
tee are Ken Schueler, Ken Hol-

Dental School Gets $175,000 Grant

The University School of Den-
tal Medicine has received a $175,-
000 grant for a graduate training
program in pharmacology. The
purpose of the program is to ini-
tiate a graduate educational re-
search program at the doctoral
level for dentally-oriented per-
sons in the basic discipline of
pharmacology.

Dr. James Smudski, professor

and chairman of the Department
of Pharmacology in the Dental

School, will head the program.
He feels that as dentistry contin-
ues to move toward a more bio-
logical orientation, the shortage
of qualified experimentalists and
teachers in pharmacology will be-
come acute. At present, there are
only ten dentists with pharmaco-
logy specialties for teaching and
research in the 50 dental schools
in the US.

The program at the University
will support three dentists or other

health-oriented degree candidates
each year to work toward a mas-
ters of Ph.D. degree. The end re-
sult of the program will provide
a source for faculty development,
not only at the University, but in
other dental schools throughout
the country. The funds for the
program will cover a five-year
period. They are provided by the
National Institute of Dental Re-
search. ‘

Summer Lesson

The impact of the Pittsburgh riots and the tragic assas-
__sination of Martin Luther King was felt in the spring. Mem-
bers of the faculty formed the University Committee to End
Racism (UCR). This committee which now lS composed of
administrators, faculty, and students is making a number of
suggestions to improve the racial inequities at the University.

Some students and student groups are beginning to assert
themselves. They are beginning to demand a say in the de-
cision-making process at the University; they are tired of
a second class citizen status. And the expression of this feel-
ing has been noticable this summer.

But the student impact into this area was not felt until
the formation of the Black Action Society (BAS), the repre-
sentative of the Black Community on campus. The BAS is-
sued a list of demands to the administration. The demands
were wide sweeping and called for the eradication of the
“University’s negative attitude toward the Black Community.”

But the BAS did not sit on its demands. Its members pur-
sued their goals by constant negotiation and pressure. They
presented their case in an admirable fashion because they
fomented change at the University—an institution traditional-
ly known for its slow reaction to change. In short, the BAS
precipitated change in an atmosphere where change was un-
thinkable. Thus the BAS is a student organization that has
won the battle for legitimacy—it has pursued goals and has
won some victories.

Perhaps the reason for the overnight success of the BAS
results from the persistence of their members—the belief in a
cause that must be won. It must be said that the members of
the BAS believe that their organization can achieve some-
thing. The BAS has legitimacy and it therefore provides an

_ example for other student organizations.

All other student organizations of this campus suffer from
an inefficiency that results from a lack of legitimacy. This
dire problem is caused from both a lack of communication
and a feeling on the part of the student body that nothing can
be done by student organizations to improve the status quo.

Last year Student Government (SG) under the leader-
ship of Ken Frederick talked about issues, passed resolutions,
and then talked about its failure to solve problems. This
caused SG to lose its legitimacy. The problem was that the
individual students were not united behind the leadership of
SG.

SG President Schueler has the dynamism to bring about
fundamental changes that will ultimately benefit every stu-
dent. SG has the overall resources to bring students into
the forefront of the University community. Schueler has
brought the faculty and student body closer together by
precipitating a basic change in the Faculty Senate by-laws.
The change allows students to sit in on Faculty Senate
Committee meetings. This may sound unimportant to the
average student, but a united student-faculty sentiment can
bring about the very changes that the University and the stu-
dent body need.

But the accomplishments of any student group be it Stu-
dent Government or the Commuter Association are all in
vain if these organizations do not have student support. What
is the use of having students on faculty committees——or any
committee—if the general student body simply doesn’t givea
damn about anything?

The lesson of the summer is clear. All student organiza-
tions must gain legitimacy—the support of the student body.
And one very basic way for student organizations to win the
victories that eventually will win legitimacy is to follow the
example of the Black Action Society——be tireless and persis-
tent in the pursuit of demands. This will show the student
body that something can indeed be accomplished. And in the
fall, the Pitt News will take up the task of convincing the stu-
dent body that change and action are in the air. And we will
be tireless and persistent.

From The End Of The Bar
  Summer’s Over, But Life’s

‘Amazin’ Times’ Continue

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Sometimes, it seems, there is just too much to say and not
enough time to say it. Time catches you unprepared. When the end
comes, and the result is apparent, it's too late.

The Pitt News ceases publication for the summer, and time
has caught me. It has caught me while I'm still thinking about what
happens at this school, in this city, in this country, and in the world.

  I,  Time allows you to think, and wonder.
' But it just keeps going on. It doesn’t wait.
When days are bad, time lingers; when days
are good, time speeds by.

I can sit back at the typewriter, look out
the window, and each time I do it I am amaz-
ed. I am amazed at the little things, like when
a young Negro girl came up and said, “Hi,
what's your name?”

I am amazed at assassinations. I am amaz-
   , ed at struggles. lam amazed at beings.

But sometimes there aren't enough words to describe every-

thing, sometimes words just don't have feelings.
The amazements will be always there, though, very commonly

there. And time will continue to bring them forth; in essence, or even

 

  

’ second by second. I guess it's just life.

To him the matter was very

Get Scholarships

The American Institute for For-
eign Trade (AIFT). a 22 year old
graduate school of international
management. has announced that
full tuition scholarships are avail-
able for the fall semester to re-
turning veterans from the Army,
Air Force, Coast Guard. Marine
Corps, and Navy. The applica-
tion deadline is August 15. Ac-
cording to President Arthur L.
Peterson, the qualifications are
honorable discharge from the
military, an acceptable bachelor’s
degree in any field with an over-
all average of grade B or better,
good communications ability in
English, strong motivation for an
international career and indica-
tions of leadership qualities.

Dr. Peterson said that the gen-
eral purpose of AIFT is to im-

     

prove the image of America over-
seas. Selections for scholarships
and for admisstion generally re-
flect this concern. The Veterans‘
Scholarships cover an academic
year, the period of time required
to secure the professional Bache-
lor of Foreign Trade degree.
