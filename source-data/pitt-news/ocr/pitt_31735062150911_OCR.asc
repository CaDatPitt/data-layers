compared with th-a-t of society in the
animal world. Approximately one--half

the subject on hand and the remainder

Academy of Science, and is on the re-
search staff of the New York Zoologi-

Press representatives and science
writers were given a preview of the
new Mellon Institute building Wednes-
day morning.

Officials of the Institute, which was
formally "dedicated in Carnegie Music
Hall yesterday afternoon, guided the
journalists through the exhibitions
and laboratories.

The various industrial fellovcships
of the Institute have set up exhitbitions
on the lower floors, explaining by ac-
tual experiments the work of the re-
spective fellows-hi.ps.

An interesting display is a large
book with moving pages illustrating
the evolution of the ionic columns
from the quarry to their placing on
the exterior of the building. The col-
umns, all moiioliths, are of Indiana
limestone. Al-thou-gh each column
weighs 62 tons,’ once in Pittsihurgh.

in place. '

McKenna, Springer, Stark

In Forensic Participation

Nineteen members of the Men's Debating Association partici-

That is the gist of a summary report prepared and issued by
Charles W. Lomas, instructor in English and director of varsity

debating. Mr. Lomas has just com-"‘

pleted his first year in the capacity
of debate coach.

Busiest man in the Association was
Bernard McKenna. C39, the report
reveals. He participated in 23 con-

Mushball Tilts 1

Postponed
By Weather

The Weather Man had too much
on the ball for the intramural mush-
ballcrs, Wednesday, and as a result
Martin J. Feely’s three independent
leagues dropped ‘their ﬁrst decision
to that bugaboo battery—rainy weath-
er and wet grounds. As soon as these

games are rescheduled, the new dates

will appear in The News. V
In the opening game in the .Engi-
necring league played Tuesday, the
Junior Chems took thefspavrlt out of
‘the Electrical Engineers with a 12-3
pasting. The 18-hit barrage laid down
by the Chems established them as
early favorites to cop the Engineer
crown, coming as it did against the
Electricals who were expected to
make a strong bid for the ‘title.

Games Tonight

The Legal Softies in the University
league and the Wolves in the Inde-
pendent league will be after_ their
ﬁrst victory tonight; The Politicos,
rained out of their ﬁrst encounter,
will stack up against the Softies as
an unknown quantity. The Wolves,
beaten 19-7 by Kappa Alpha Phi,
Monday, face the same situation in
the Buzzers. Already far aheadof
the rest of the teams in games played,
the Junior Chems will mee't the»ME’s
on Upper Trees ﬁeld at 6 o'clock.

The situation in the Fraternity
mushball muddle remained the same
today. According to Robert Corley,
assistant to the dean of men, who is
in charge of drawing up the schedule,
plans have been held up by the-incle-
ment weather and the trouble in get-
ting a suitable ﬁeld.

be reckoned with as either a second

point dilferentiat-ion.

State will score heavily in the two-
mile run with Pete Olexy ‘a certain
winner. Tost will end up in one of
the places, whichever it is accounting

’ for‘ the Panther scoring in this event.

Ryden Again
The 220-yard low hurdles is an-

other Ryden event. Other places may
be juggled between Lasky and Bauer.
These sum totals have a decided Pan-
ther partiality.

That , complexion changes from
white to rosy red when the field
events are considered." Weak in the
weights, Pitt will lose more than its
accustomed points in these events.

. Bennett will record some points in
the discus, three being. the most pos-
sible. The high" jump, with Penn
State’s Redmond to be considered, is
a Lion eve-nt. Bennett and» Oden
should pick up some much needed
tallies. I -  ‘

to tl_Ie_.L’io>ns with Clark,‘ who,.did' 12'

feet 9' inches against the Sailorfs. Ger-
rety andfClifton are given a second

and third. One point in. the shot-put
is only a forlorn Olson hope. Big-
gest ﬁeld grief will come to the smil-
ing Swede when Taiano is beaten in:
the- javelin, a ﬁrst place‘ for him? in
every meet," thus far. State's Tom
Priblo heaves somewhere near 200
feet. Ills colleague, .Ha»nley, will
ﬁght it out with Taano for second
place. Broad jump. points favor the
Staters.

This is the dope. Pitt is in ex-
treme danger of losing its ﬁrst meet
of the year tomorrow.

Need Care, Says Ray Cross

By ROBERT ADAMS

It is more than likely that Tom
Locke, Walt Notwatny, Red McQuil-
lan, and Bill Brown aren't especially
interested in the ‘technical side of wa-
ter puriﬁcation.

But if it weren’t for the combina-
tion of ﬁlters, pumps, and chlorinat-
ing equipment in use up at the Trees
Gym pool, Pat Corr’s star swimmers
wouldn't ﬁnd indoor swimming very
much of a sport.

Keeping the 80,000 gallons of
water in the pool in a condition high
above the standards set by the State
Board of Health, requires regular su-
pervision and special puriﬁcation
equipment, explains Raymond‘ L.
Coss, superintendent of" buildings and
grounds.

Tests of the water in thepool are
taken regularly to insurer its abso-
lute purity. Daily tests are made to
ﬁnd the percentage of chlorine, and
a bac'teria=count* is taken once av-week
by stall’ members of the School of
Medicine.

Constant circulation of the water
in the pool through the purification
system is maintained by a rotary
pump which sends between 55 and 60
gallons per minute through the ﬁlters.
Water going through the ﬁlter sys-
tem leaves the pool through a pipe

at the deep end, and passes through
a boiler which keeps the temperature

"ties.

at 74 degrees, with less than one de-
gree variation. .

Passing through the rotary pump
and a flow meter, the water separates
into two lines, eachof which runs
through a ﬁlter tank ﬁlled wi'tli'suc-
cessive layers of large gravel, small
gravel, and sand. A thin layer of
soda ash and alum catches all im-
puritiesnot already removed.‘

After leaving the ﬁlters, water
passes a chlorinating device, which in-
jects the necessary amount of chlo-
rine, and then returns to the pool at
entries along the sides.

In addition ‘to being passed through
the ﬁlter systein, water in the pool is
cleaned weekly by a suction hose
which reiroves lint and impurities
from the pool bottom. Dust collect-
ing on the surface of the water is
driven off by a hig'h-pressure hose.

Every two weeks the impurities
which collect‘ in the ﬁlters are re-
moved. Pipes through which the
water ordinarily circulates are closed,
and two special pipes opening on‘ the
ﬁlters, one from the city water sys-
tem and one leading to the sewers,
are opened.

Water from the city mains. run.

Then a new layer of soda ash

lntercollegiate Clipping

By Irene Long
A Unionized Whaler

Sit-down strikes can be traced back to Jonah, the
biblical character who was swallowed by the whale. At
least that's what a writer in the Michigan Daily proves
from the scriptures.

_Jonah didn’t belong to the CIO, nor was he troubled
with labor difficulties. He was displeased because his
prophecy that Ninevah would fall because of its iniqui-
ties didn"t materialize: “But it displeaseth Jonah exceed-
ingly, and he was angry.” (Jonah 4:1). “Then Jonah
went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city,
and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
shadow, till he might see what would become of the
city.” So! Keeping up with ‘the Jonahs, or somp’n.

Hail, The Greeks

SCI-IOLASTICALLY, we are reminded by the 1'

fraternity averages which were released today
by the dean of men's office, the Greeks have been
doing right well by themselves during the past
semesters.

It was only a little over a year ago that several
chapter charters were threatened, and the order
was given that if the scholastic averages of the
“low” houses were not raised above the required
1.0 mark, the charters would be revoked. One
house stood as low as .75, another .83, and still
a third .91.

Today, in every instance, the Greek - letter
chapters stand above the 1.0 mark. The all-fra-
ternity average is 1.341 for the past fall semes-
ter, just a shade under the record of 1.357 of the
preceding spring semester of 1936. Compared to
averages of semesters previous, the boost is even
more startling.

In 1934-35, the All-Fraternity average was
1.296, slightly better than the 1933-34 mark of
1.245. During the first semester of the latter year
the average dropped to 1.18, possibly the 811-
time low. Thus, in the past three years the com-
posite scholastic picture of the fraternity groups
has improved steadily until today the Greeks
have just about drawn up abreast with the all-
men’s average of 1.363.

It is a tribute to the members that the frater-
nity average of 1.341 for the past semester so
nearly equals that mark. It is not unlikely that
some day the fraternities which have at times
showed tendencies of lowering the scholastic
standing of the University may go on to the ex-
tent that soon they may be the pace-setters in
the scholastic ﬁeld at the University. Credit is
due the present senior class of fraternity men for
taking the initiative to improve by both setting
the example and by teaching the younger men to
take their scholastic assignments more seriously.
It is recognized that most fraternity men have
the ability and background to do the work well;
but it has been the incentive that has been lack-
ing. The situation is also a tribute to an even

greater extent to the dcan’s office for encouraging.

efforts in this direction.

This comes on the heels of last year-’s progres-
sive move to abolish hell—week, a move that met
the approval of a unanimous group of student
and faculty leaders attending the National Inter-
fraternity Conference in New York in Novem-
ber of 1935. And by such measures of reform,
fraternities are making convincing answers to
the questions of those who challenge their
existence.

Actual ideals in fraternity life are changing
to prove the theoretical ideals that fraternities
have been fostering for scores of years. Intellec-
tual activity is certainly not one that has been
emphasized in its correct proportion to other
fraternity activities during the years past. Theo-
retically, the fraternity has championed intellec-
tual activities, but it has always been the social,
athletic, good-time, stunt, spectacular, secretive,
hair-raising, ritual and trivial activity that has
received the emphasis. Perhaps they are entering
a new era.

Matinee

The Little Theater

Finding a door open into the Foster Meinorial this
morning we stole a look—see at the interior of what will
most likely be the haven for all of the University enter-
tainment groups next year and for many years to come.
Although the theatre itself is rather small (it will seat
approximately 550), the size merely gives it an “our
own little theater" atmosphere. . . And speaking of at-
mosphere——when the auditorium and stage-is completed,
the little theater will be the most formal looking of all
the showhouses in this theater-ridden burg. . . To con-
trast the severe gray of the interior Indiana limestone
walls all of-the furnishings will be either CHERRY RED
or MAROON. . . The stage curtain and the seat uphol-
stering, the former. . . '

From a stage technician’s viewpoint the building of the
stage has been anything but satisfactory: Proper stage
dimensions have been sacriﬁced for architectural effect;
the proscenium opening is far too narrow; the gridiron
above the stage does; not even ﬁll average stage demands;
and to top another ten to twenty miscalculations a large
window has been built backstage. . . But, of course all
of this was unavoidable because of "the need to preserve
the building's complete Gothic effect . . . which effect has

been excellently developed by the designers.

For iho Erileriainmeni Groups

Despite these obvious technical shortcomings we will
be glad to think of the Foster Memorial as our “home
.'iudi‘torium” next year. . . PITT PLAYERS plan to use
it for their '37-’38 productions . . . The subject of Pitt
Players leads to a digression——Several of this year's
shows drew crowds that would make an elopement wed-
ding ceremony look overrun by comparison. . . lt is
amazing that a university the size of ours cannot fur-
nish decent support for its only dramatics organization,
especially when we consider that schools like the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin are able to boast of pre-season
sales that have reached the $9,000 mark . . . Some have
claimed that a campus theater would be a stimulus for
much larger turnouts. . . Well next year we will have
that campus showhouse, one of the most beautiful of
its kind in the country. . .

And the other groups will most likely follow the
Players’ lead. CAP and GOWN anticipates a two week
run. two wc<:k.; llcfilll.‘-“ of the limited seating capacity.
. . . WOMEI\"S C'l.l,0llAL, MF.N’S GLEE CLUB, the OR-
CHESTRA and BAND, all will probably take advan-
tage of its facilities. *

And More

But the story of the auditorium doesn’t tell it all.
Fiirnislied with the most modern of equipment (com-
bined hot and cold faucets promp'ted this) a dozen odd
dressing rooms adjoin the stage. . . AND the lower ﬂoor,
beside containing a spacious kitchen that will come in
handy at BANQUET TIME (not to be confused with
the picture of a similar name), boasts a truly ﬁne sized
DANCE HALL . . . where more than one beau will lead

In Strange Jobs

Professions Include

Tutors, Pallbearers

By ROBERT E. GETTIG

We’ve heard of people who walk ﬁfteen
miles or so a day on doctor’s orders, but P. K.
Penn, a college pre-med student, is as healthy
as they come and still manages to pick ’em
up and put ’em down four or ﬁve hours a day
for six days in the week.

The reason—he is 9. “pipe line walker” for Atlantic
Reﬁning Company in the afternoons he can spare from
classes and biology exams, and gets good pay for his
daily dozen in the fressli air. A “pipe line walker,” in
case you are wondering, is one who inspects gasoline.
pipes for leaks, faulty connections, etc. Penn’s route is
a part of the Atlan'tic’s line to Philadelphia.

Penn is not the only student who is putting dollars
into his pocket at the same time he is cramming knowl-
edge into his head, by means of unusual part-time jobs
on and oil" the campus. According to N. Robert Seidle,
director of the Employment Bureau, such jobs range
from shoe salesmen to pallbearers and cover almost
every conceivable type of employment.

One bright young engineering student, John Rice, got
himself a job pasting pictures in a hand-made album
for a Pittsburgh family.

A freshman, James Murphy, is busy learning one
angle of the newspaper game. Murphy takes want-ads
over the telephone for the Pittsburgh Press.

Two boys are doing their bit to increase the circula-
tion of two large magazines by organizing “magazine
rou'tes”————this is, signing up crews of boys to solicit sub-
scriptions. They aie R. L. Kornhauser and Thomas Mont-
gomery, employed by Curtis Publishing and Collier’s
respectively.

Some folks would consider pallbearing an unlovely
task, but to enterprising students it’s just another job.
A few boys even work as “sleepers,” staying overnight
in undertaking parlors to answer telephones.

Another survey——this time of auto owners and driv-
ers——was made for General Electric by John Glasser
and Emerson Hess, the latter a student in the law
school.

Other students are busy as tutors. window washers
and paper hang'e1's. Several have developed ﬁrst—rate

meat-cutters out of themselves for the beneﬁt of Mr‘,-

Cann’s, Donahoe’s, and other local food emporiums.
Enough boys were musically inclined to make up tliree
separate orchestras for steamers on summer cruises. and
one for a summei resort in Vermont. Still others have
performed such unusual jobs as putting up Christnias
trees and taking out dogs for daily walks.

The only profession we haven’t found represented yet
by the male student body is ‘taking care of babies, We're
expecting them to branch out in that line any day.

I Answer to Wednesday’s Brain-Straightener I

In case the man's ingenuity was not equal to Mon-
day's “Brain Straightener," the following method is rec-
ommended: He should ﬁrst secure an end of the rope at
some point on the shoreline——place it under a rock or
tie it to a stake——and then he should walk around the
lake, laying the rope along the edge as he goes. When
he returns to the point where he started, he will have
circled the pole with the rope. All that remains to be
done is to make a noose in the five hundred and first
foot of the rope (500 feet were used in going around
the lake), slip the other end through, as in a lariat and
pull tight around the base of the pole.

As for the paradox, Bostonians pride themselves on

the accuracy of the English they speak, and thus they
would say the largER station, not the largEST.

Symphony Of Rain

T HE children had been dying

off during the past few
months because he had not been
able to get them enough to eat.
First it had been Annie, the
youngest. “Yes, I’m afraid it’s a pret-
ty bad case of TB,” the doctor de-
cided the night before she died. “Say,”

he asked, looking at the old man, “has
there been a strain of TB running

He Talked To Himself

Bad on the nerves. I'm getting a
little jumpy, he added, rolling a

Tick, tick, breathe and gasp.
Tick, tick, breathe and gasp. Tick,
tick, gasp. Tick, tick, breathe. Tick,
tick, breathe. Tick, tick, tock. Tick,
tick, tock. He pulled a cover over
Martin, put on his top coat, went
out in the rain to the bridge.

The city was streaked with rain,

is

in your family?”

He coughed, kept staring at the
little bed where the youngster was
moving restlessly. To and fro, to and
fro. Pretty soon she’d roll over to the
left slowly, and then back more slow-
ly. Then the pendulum would lose
its momentum, sink quietly into place.
No key to rewind the works.

Annie died the next evening. He
left her with the other two, while
he went for a “short walk on the
bridge.” Up and down, up and
down, the moon slipped silently out
from the back of a cloud, carved’
an amber path on the water up to
the post of the bridge. Up and
down. Then he went home.

Two weeks later it was Pauline,
the same way. That left Martin,
his oldest, and himself. Just the two
of them.

The bridge was darker than it had,

been fourteen days ago. The moon,
as poets said, was in its cradle. Oc-
casional glimniers broke the darkness
as he walked up and down the old
bridge. Even the bridge seemed older
tonight, he mused. He thought of the
first Pauline. She wouldn't have liked
this now, his walking on the bridge.
This was the same bridge where she
had agreed to marry him, a poor but
ambitious carpenter then. Now he
was an old carpenter.

The water was noisy below, slap-
ping up against the pillars of the
bridge and then dropping back to the
river. He went home to see Martin.
The next day they were to bury Paul-
ine, and he had a lot of work to do.
The box wasn't large, but it needed
a few ﬁnishing touches.

* i i

ARTIN would have been fourteen
N on Sunday had he lived. It wasn’t
TB this time. Just an everyday case
of pneumonia. The old man seemed
to be getting used to it: these last
quiet hours of unconsciousness when
the rhythm of the clock is broken by
the rhythm of breathing.

Breathing and gasping, breathing
and gasping. No variation. Tick,
tick, tock, tick, tick, tock, tick, tick,
tock from the clock on the mantel.
It was still raining. That made it
a whole week of continuous rain.

rain that cut obliquely across the
darkness. The bridge seemed darker
than usual, silhouetted against the
night. Rain fell monotonously, mak-
ing dark puddles in depressions on
the bridge. The puddles caught an oc-
casional ﬂickcr from the lamps.

The lamps ﬂickered, crackled, light-
ing up a part of the sidewalk on the
bridge where the old man walked. Up
and down, up and down. He stopped,
seemed to be staring at the rain, not
noticing it was seeping through his
great coat, through his old sweater, to
his skin.

Out into space. A layer of fog was
drifting up and down on the river.
Once he pulled out a bandana, wiped
his face, blew his nose. The rain
coursed down his cheeks over the
channels of wrinkles, collected in
drops at his chin.

Possibly because of the water and
the lamps with their careless reflec-
tion, his wrinkles became thin, illumi-
nated streaks, tracing contours on
his face.

His large hands were red and
chapped, clutched on the bridge rail-
ing. Strange, his ﬁnger nails were
polished. Presently he took his hands
from the rail, stuffed them into his
wet pockets. He smiled—-or no, he
frowned; it was a mixture of the
Greek tragedy and comedy masks
found on stage curtains. Strange.

That was for an instant. Then
he turned away, his face solemn
again, and trudged mechanically
through the water puddles on the
walk, his shoes oozing the foggy
wetness.

A heavy supporting plank sliced
him in two for a moment. Then he
appeared again, farther down the
bridge, automatically dragging one
foot after the other.

The monotonous
not faster, not slower. The old man
was completely out of sight, behind
a pillar. The mechanical footsteps
stopped for a moment.

Faintl_v, the interruption of wet
sonietliiiig I,
solid; silence and the rain; a faint’

clothes slapping against
dull hollow sound below, like that of
a tiny pebble sinking to the bottom
of a depthless pool.

Silence and the rain.
