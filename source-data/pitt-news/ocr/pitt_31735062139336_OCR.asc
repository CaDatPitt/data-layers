The other day in- Schenley Park .I
was stopped by a stranger very Eng-

spoke of the ﬁne wide -walks and then
remarked that they were certainly

There is a great "deal of ‘money

the earliest contest dating back not
more than 40, years. Our athletic
sports, as running,.jumping, etc., came

_ -to us through the descendants of Eng-

lish and Scotc'h settlers. ,

In college circles every student
wishes his college to win in such com-
petitions and that is the ri-ght spirit,
but it gives rise to a problem which
detracts from the true idea with which
competition originated.
Those persons who are especially
adapted go out ,-for the team, and
those who are less able bodied and

’most need the exe-rcise and training.
‘ offered on the track and ﬁeld areﬁon

the stands wa-tching.
‘The advantages of tra_ck are so"
varied that any student can ﬁnd one
or more in which he may become -pro-
ﬁcient in‘ pursuing-it. 4 With the ad-
vance of the records the all around
star «is less common than in_the past
and men have begunto, specialize in
one orltwo events. This leaves .a
large ‘opportunity for ‘men who wish
to enter this branchiof sport. ‘
The time may notube far distant
when track athletics will be a required‘,
of the‘ University course. In;

(3. Thecultiva-tion. of the; beauti-

These are the mottoes that should

country and spread broadcast
throughout the land. We may 1-ook

 : BENEFIT PERFORMANCE

At the request of the Sena-te the
Cap and Gown "Club has graciously
consented to give another perform-
ance of. “The Prince of S'ham‘,”. next
Thursday night.

To do this not only necessitates
sacriﬁces on the part ofthe members,
{but also of the Alumni ‘atuthe headiof
this club. The time spent: in rehears-
ting will interfere. with the school
=work,..which at this time is rapidly
drawing to a close and requires every
available minute. . ‘

The Alumni, ‘who "are directing the
production,-must drop all their pro-
fessional work:-fand be present at an
‘actual loss of money, This is the
highest type‘ of loyalty to one’s alma

.mater. - .

- Again, the social and dance given
by the School of Education last night
for the beneﬁt of the'student publica-
Eion debt is,a’ very commendable af-
air. '

-Such efforts as these are the essence
of school spirit and ought to be car-
ried out more extensively. The ef-
forts thus far cannot be too highly
praised and they indicate the impor-
tance of these. publications in the
eyes of the students, alunini and the
faculty. , A  " '

Every student should. willingly do
his part now by advertising the
“Prince of Sham.” It’ is the duty of

each ~on_e to see that the theater is
ﬁlled that night. - ,

PITT, MEN IN GOOD “

‘(Continued from’  go 1)
scholastic events. The half-mile track
at the Oval is one of the very l)€S.l
in the country, and has been Put In
perfect condition for tomorrow’s con-
test. 5

 

‘Thelist of events in.éach class is up
the same as in former intercollegiate.
and’ interscholastic meets, making in.-

allt a total of 37 events.\ Manager
Hall has orde_red some handsome
medals of new design, gold, silver and
bronze, to be awarded the individual
winners, and gold for the members
of the victorious relay teams. The

scoring will be as usual—-5 for" ﬁrsts,

3 for ‘seconds 2 for thirds and 1 for
fourths. The scholastic meet will be
‘conducted under the rules of the VV.
P. I. A.‘ A. which permits no athlete
over 21 years of age to. compete and
requires at least 15 recitation hours
per week. The latter rule also.ap-
plies to the college meet. ‘ '
-The entrance of Penn State. this
year makes the meet especially in-
teresting. State’s team "comes here
for the first time and bids fair to
make a great debut. They recently
«lowered the colors of the University
of Virginia, the southern intercol-
legiate champions, and on “dope”
seem to be able to take the lion’s
share of the points. '
Both Pitt and W.—&
strong contenders for the title and
expect to give State a hard tussle.
The strength of the University of
West Virginia team is not known.
How-ever, they have some stars, the
chief of whom are Cady, Cooper and
Griliirth in the sprints; Mason
Richardson in the" distances‘,
Boyles in the weights. ’
'VV.estm-inster has~not -sent its indi-

and

vidual entries, although it is’ known A

to have a numberlof good men.

celled on any modern stage, t00l{
place in such rapid succession as to
bewilder even the learned audience
present. From his wonderful furnace
Hermes Trix Magistus brought fortn
a toy spade for Chancellor McCor-
mick attached to which was the for-
lowing Egyptian -poem:

“Sammy Mack, thou hustler,

Who bustles and who bounds,
VVho yearly ﬁlls Pitt’s treasury
With dollars, francsand pounds.

To thee who worketh night and day,

In sunshine and in s'hade

eFor breaking ground for buildings

The Gods send this big spade."

 

Dean. Fetterman receiyed a collec-
tion of small animals and the follow-
ing rhyme: , «
“Bi-o, bi-0, ology is his line, A
And yet he’s such a worker for a

deanship he ﬁnds time.
To save him a trip to Africa and
lands of other clirne; A '
I give him these very rare specimens
which cost me ‘but a dime.”

Dean Mellor avas presented with a
“Monkey Jumper” and told:
“Mellor, Mellor, I’ve been thinking,
A newdance would be quite ﬁne, 7
For your proteges dramatic.
Let them up and downward climb. .
If they master this, and not you, .
You’ll sell, tickets with a rush, _
And win such a reputation
You’ll be the dramatic push.”

‘A miniature automobile rushed in-
to Dean Bishop, with, the Alchemist

, singing: A

“Doctor Bishop thy t'houghts I read,
Long hast thou home been strolling

Hermes is with thee,.and thus presents
An auto to take thee rolling.”

Dean Holdsworth was ‘given a
purse with -th-is enclosure: '
“Doctor Holdsworth"s always busy,

Saving cash in every nook, T’
He’s the death of corporations

And of the ﬁnancial crook. .
Pitt of him is proud, and happy ‘

For his frank and honest look. ’
Hermes feels he -should reward him '

With this big fat pocket book.”

 

Doctor Phillips received a toy bal-
ance, weights, notebook, etc., and
Hermes sang again: 2
“Gas and o-il in Mother Earth’s chest-,‘

‘Yo-ho and there is some. '

As the curtain
caused the new auto—.bu_sses to ap-

pear andcarried the audience to the
Japanese Gardeii_in 107 Thaw Hall.

Here Dr. Weiirich, chairman‘ of. the

committees made a few introductor,» ,

remarks and presided. A black-‘lace
quartette consisting of Professor:
Holder, Foraker, Albert .and' Harry,
assisted at the piano by Doctor Sny-
der,‘crooned and warbled as only

called again and again, and ﬁnally
collapsed from utter exhaustion. _
Messrs. Johnston, Butler and Rice
of the Cap and Gown Club were
called by wireless and promptly
dropped upon the platform in min-
strelsy. Their songs are always top~.
notch and such little jokes as “\7Vhy
does Doctor McCormick resemble a
lottery gambler? Because he's 24
chance—seller (chancellor)” and “If
Doctor Bisihop gets $20,000 a year

the ‘house down. ’
Dancing followed in the Japanese
Garden and refreshments were served

'.at small tables in the Roof Garden,

where the guests were entertained by

Melba, Bonci, Caruso, Mary Garden,

Ysaye and manya other musical celeb-

rities brought here under the direc~ ’

tion of Prof. Ulrey. .
Everyoneso completely forgot the

time that it was necessary to. escort

the guests to the door .at midnight

to avoid violation of the “Blue
Laws.” _ _ .
The committee, Doctor Wenrich,

other college professors who assisted,

perfectly established a new record in
