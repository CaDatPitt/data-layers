Public education must learn from private sector, Hickok says

Cesca Antonelli
News Editor

It _is essential for public
education to learn from the
private sector and vice
versa, and the relationship
needs to go further than the
donation of funds, accord-
ing to Pennsylvania
Secretary of Education
Eugene Hickok.

Hickok spoke yesterday
at a conference sponsored
by the Katz Business
School to debate the possi-
bilities and consequences of
privatizing education. The
conference brought together
business people and educa-
tors from across the country
to talk about the market for
private education services
and past experiences with
privatization in Wilkinsburg
and Baltimore.

“The broader question is
‘Can the private sector
serve the public interest?’ I
would "answer a resounding
yes,” Hickok said. “The real
question is, ‘Is there really
any doubt that the private
se'c*to’r”can -"serve the public

interest?’ I would say it is
quintessentially
American...The public
interest is served and served
well.” . .    .

Hickok said that many
people today are question-
ing the commitment of the
private sector to education

because the‘'‘ ‘cou‘r‘i’try" has

“strayed from our political,
economic, -and social
roots.” He said that today
there is a sense that some-
thing is missing, and in that
sense, the “obvious” has

A gotten lost.

Hickok said that in
many areas, private inter-

vention into public school-

ing is . already there.
Children in these areas
arrive at schools built by
private companies on buses
operated by private corpo-
rations. They eat meals pre-
pared by private sector
worke.rs and attend classes
in rooms and labs cleaned
by private companies. In
many cases, the security
guards in schools are also
from private corporations.
And, even in areas where
none of those things are
true, Hickok stressed that
students use desks, pencils,
and textbooks made by the
private sector.

“Almost every aspect of
a child’s day at school...is
impacted by the work of the
private sector,” Hickok

‘said. “The” "private sector

has as much influence in
the course of a day as the
public sector.”

Hickok said that this
influence was both neces-
sary and proper in a capital-

ist system. He returned to-

some of the framers of the
Constitution for ideas about
why the needs of the public,
especially in education, are
met by interweaving public
and private. Hickok cited
James Madison, Thomas
Jefferson, and Alexis
DeTocquevi1le to say that
when private endeavors fare
well, so do public ones.

“My economic interests .

depend on yours; my pros-
perity is tied to yours,”
Hickok said. “The general
public interest depends on
private interest.” '

Hickok said that many
people think that education
is separate from economic
interests; that it is “sacred.”
But according to Hickok,
this is just not the case. He
feels optimistic about the
growing connections

Business dean wins honors before retiring

‘ Dawnita Wilson
For The Pitt News

The dean of Pitt’s business
school, the longest reigning
business school dean in the
country, has been awarded the
first Joint Presidential Citation
ever presented by the board of
directors of the American
Association of Collegiate
Schools of Business (AACSB)
and the board of governors of
the national business honorary
society, Beta Gamma Sigma.

Katz Business School Dean
H.J. Zoffer, who will retire this
year after being dean for 28
years, received the award for
over 40 years of service to
business and management, his
accomplishments inbusiness
education, and his dedication
to excellence.

“[Zoffer] is a tireless work-
er and a charismatic-leader who
never puts limits on his time
and service to both organiza-
tions, higher education for
business, or the development
and success of the Katz

Beta Gamma Sigma presiden-
tand dean emeritus and Arthur
M. Weider professor at Indiana
University’s business school.

Zoffer has served on the
board of both the AACSB and
Beta Sigma Gamma, and was
president of the AACSB from
1985-86.

Zoffer, who refers to his

‘retirement as a “transition,”

had nothing but positive things
to say of his upcoming move.

“I will miss the day-to—day
smell of the grease paint, as
they say, but I look forward to
being more in control of -my
time,” Zoffer said.

A Pittsburgh native, Zoffer
has spent his entire college
career at Pitt.‘ He received his
Business Bachelor’s and
Master’s of Arts, as well as his
doctorate here. He began teach-
ing here in 1956. ‘ ' V

“I almost left Pittsburgh
number of times, but there was
always something that kept me
here,” Zoffer said. “When I
was a student, college was a
ladder out of your current cir-
cumstances and into better

went to get done what you had
to do.”

_Zoffer has been part of
many changes that have taken
place at the business school
during his tenure, but he said
that he is especially proud of
the fact that the school has

developed into an “internation- V

al domain” that has welcomed
a number of students from
diverse backgrounds. Zoffer is
also pleased with the new
international programs the
school has to offer, the new
building beingconstructed, and
the considerable growth of fac-
ulty and staff. He feels that all
of these aspects will benefit the
school by exposing students to
a quality learning environment
and a number of unique learn-
ing options.

The Katz School has gained
an international‘ reputation for
its top-rated 11-month MBA
program and Executive MBA
programs. Under Zoffer’s lead-
er-ship, eight endowed chairs
and associates programs were
also established. The school

(Editors note: This is the next piece

IfI were forced to pinpoint one
reason for even considering the
summer voyage, it would have to be
Australia. Everyone has one of
those places that, for all their lives,
they have always wanted to visit.
Mine was the land down under.
Whether it was triggered by the

the accent, I co11ldn’t tell you. But I
can assure you that, my childhood
fascination grew into an adult
dream. That dream came true, and I
wasn’t disappointed . ,1

I went on an excursion that
included the Great Barrier Reef and
Ayers Rock. Theﬁrst stop, the reef,
proved to be a wonderful ﬁrst time
experience. I’ve lived in Florida for
12 years, so I have been snorkeling
many times, but have never seen a

eats kangaroo

say I’d ﬁnally seen one.

Before heading off to Ayers
Rock, I went tandem sky diving.
For anyone who hasn’t done this
before, let me try to describe the
feeling. The actual free fall was 20
seconds, which seemed more like
two minutes. The ﬁrst minute, you
don’t even realize that you are
falljng.During the second minute, it
hits you, during which time your
stomach, and every other organ,
tries to get back into the plane.

The afternoon was spent
exploring Ayers Rock and the sur-
rounding area, known as Uluru to
the Aborigines.

Uluru is a sandstone monolith
with nothing but desert all around it.
It is frequently considered the
world’s biggest mood rock because
it changes color depending on the
weather, the time of day, or distance.
It’s best known for its spectacular
color changes during sunsets.
Unfortrmately, it was cloudy most of
the day, so we didn’t get the full
effect,but the sun did manage to
peek out of the clouds for a couple
of minutes and put on a show. What
was before a huge brown rock trans-
formed into a towering red wonder.

I can’t even begin to comprehend .
' what it’s like on a good night.

The rest of the evening present-
ed even more interesting events. For
dinner, I put my very own kangaroo
kabob on the barbie. It was quite
delicious. It had the texture of leg of
lamb and the taste of a juicy steak.
Basically, it was a tender, stringy
steak. After dinner, I joined several

others for a desert stroll to do some

star gazing.

There I was in total silence
(except for the occasional dingo cry,
which I am pleased to report did not
result in a single stolen baby), look-
ing at a sky that didn’t have a single
square millimeter without 50 stars in
it. It was quite a powerful moment.

That morning, before returning
to Sydney, our group met for a sun-
rise climb up Ayers Rock The ini-
tial climb was on a 70 degree
incline. The rest of it was a walk
across the top, which was like walk-
ing across a curve in a wind tunnel.
With 20 to 30 mile an hour gusts
trying to blow me olf the side, I kept
going up and down. I made it in just
over half an hour. This was by far
the biggest thing that I have ever
accomplished, so it was a moving
personal moment. Anyone who has
ever conquered the world will know
how I felt; otherwise, the best I can
say is that I was very happy.

Upon returning to Sydney, I

saw the opening of “La Boheme” at

the Sydney Opera House. Now, I’m
by no stretch of the imagination an
opera fan, but considering where I
was, I absolutely loved it.

My impressions of Australia

. will always be of my experiences

away from the cities. For anyone

-who knows The Muppet Movie, I

have to agree with Gonzo: I’m
going to go back there someday.

Study finds older students
dominant in class discussions

Cesca Antonelli
News Editor

Older, “nontraditional” college stu-

. dents are more active in classroom dis-

cussions than younger students, accord-
ing to a Purdue University study. This
ﬁnding could inﬂuence the way profes-
sors teach as more and more community
members return to school to get a better
job or start a new career.

About 56 percent of the older stu-
dents participated in
the discussion, com-
pared with 37 percent
of the younger ones.
The proportion of
older students making
two or more com-
ments per class was
almost double that of
the younger students,
with 40.4 percent to
20.7 percent.

Possible conclusions drawn by
researchers about this difference include
one theory that increased experience in
life, inside and outside the classroom,
helps in overcoming any discomfort
about being a “nontraditional” student, so
that these students participate at a higher
rate. I

The researchers used three different
methods for gathering information: class-
room observation, a written survey, and
personal interviews. Trained research

assistants observed thirteen different
classrooms and recorded student partici-
pation that was either student or profes-
sor initiated. They also ‘recorded the gen-
der of the student and whether the stu-
dent was 24 or younger (traditional age).

Of the students in observed classes,
64 percent were female. Thirty—seven
percent of the students were nontradition-
al. Researchers indicated that these fig-
ures were representative of the university
as a whole.

In addition to the findings concerning
student age, the
study continued a
line of recent stud-
ies showing that
men participate
more than women.’
In the Purdue study,
men averaged 1.72
comments per class,
compared with 1.46
comments for
women.

In interviews, students cited the most
common reasons for their lack of partici-
pation as “feeling that I don’t know
enough about the subject” (49.4 percent);
“large size of the class” (38.2 percent); “I
had not done the assigned reading” (36.5
percent); “feeling that my ideas are not
well formulated” (32.4 percent); “chance
that I would appear unintelligent to other
students” (30 percent); and “chance that I
would appear unintelligent to the instruc-
tor” (20.6 percent).

Correction: Namosha Smith is the assistant dean for student affairs at the
Law School, not the dean of the School, as reported in the July 3 edition. The semi-
nar on African Americans and the criminal justice system wasiheaded by Lester
‘Cain of Pitt’s Office of Community and Public Service. The Law School cospon-
sored the events with the Homer S. Brown Law Association.

Solutions to Pitt's problems can be found in alleys and gutters

What the University of Pittsburgh needs
is more strikes! i

It also needs a few more gutters, and
somewhere in between, a spare or two.

If this doesn’t make sense by now, what
Pitt needs is more bowling. This is the answer
to a number of Pitt’s problems.

First, it has been lamented by various
groups composed of everyone in the Pitt com-
munity, students and faculty that unless you
want to go to a bar, there is no place in Oakland
-to go. The campus is surrounded by bars, tav-
erns, watering holes, but that’s about all. There
is not even a movie theater in ‘Oakland. What
this amounts to is that if you’re under 21,
there’s not much for you to do in Oakland
except your homework.

Now, if there were a bowling alley,
things would be different. It would not even
have to serve beer to draw people. All it would
need to do is recognize that a student’s budget
is not conducive to paying six bucks a game
along with 12 for shoe rental, and it would be
packed. _

Bowling is a low impact, social sport
that groups of friends can do without too much
isolation or competition. It would give them all
some place to‘ go after that last Friday (or in
Pitt’s case, Thursday) class and let off a little
steam before settling in to do what they have to

_ Stephen H. Segal / Graphics Editor
Pitt needs to return to the glory days of yesteryear.

do. Also, it would be a relief from the Sunday
doldrums that affect students.

There’s even a place to put it. We could
build it over the old site of the Syria Mosque.
Pitt knocked it down and paved a gateway to

paradise to put up a parking lot. If not there,
because parking is precious, even when students
aren’t allowed to use it, then maybe we could
put it in the Union. The closest bowling alley to
the campus, Forward Lanes, is a second floor
bowling alley. Maybe we could make use of one
of the dining rooms on the first ﬂoor or take out
the ballroom, which never seems to have an
actual ball in it. Other university student unions
have bowling alleys in them, so this is not an
unprecedented move. ‘

The other benefit to bowling is that it
could inspire on-campus unity through friendly
competition. The different schools and depart-
ments could field teams. We could have match-
es between Pharmacy and Engineering, for
example. Cut throat bowling might be the way
to go as well. We could bowl for scholarships.

Have the ‘different sports and academic teams .

compete wagering their scholarships and pump
up some of these programs. The bowling might

be a little Darwinian at this point, but it has pos-

sibilities.

Perhaps we could even turn it into a var-
sity sport and finally be able to beat Penn State
at something. The bowling grudge matches
would be sure to draw people in to see them.

The benefits to this are just too great,
they canbe ignored no longer. It is time to bring
bowling to Oakland.

   

What happened to the promise of integration?

Rick
Nowlin

If you ever wondered whatever

V happened to the promise of racial inte-

gration, you only need to look at
Yazoo City, Miss.

A recent report on ABC News
noted that, 30 years after the civil
rights movement tore that state apart,
Little League baseball players in that
town still play in separate leagues _
one white, one black — and everyone
in that city seems to like it that way.
That would have surprised me years

' ago.

But not today.

In fact, despite longstanding
attempts to bring racial minorities into
the “mainstream” of American society,
we often still divide ourselves along
those lines. And I can tell you why.

The truth is, over centuries of
American-style “apartheid” we simply
became comfortable with the separa-
tion to the point that we actually cher-
ish and emphasize our differences; the
chasm between the races,’ once
enforced in some states by law, actual-
ly developed a cultural context. That’s
why it’s historically been so difficult
(some would say impossible) to foster
a truly integrated society, as the meet-
ing of diverse cultural values, by defi-
nition, requires a certain amount of
adjustment that some would rather not
deal with. In other words, we don’t
understand each other and don’t partic-
ularly want to.

You see, in any healthy rela-
tionship, the people involved simply
do not remainthe same as they start
out. Optimally, they will mature and
grow toward each other and, in the
process, inﬂuence each other due to

their contrasting and complementary
viewpoints.

But to maintain such a rela-
tionship takes trust, humility, commit-
ment, and communication — all of
which have long been sorely lacking
when it comes to race relations. And
sadly, those few brave souls willing to
take risks and cross those lines often
get the label of “sellout.”

I know. I’ve been there.

Nearly 25 years ago, while
attending a then mostly-white
Christian academy, I saw early on that
if I wanted to make friends, I would
have to learn to relate to my classmates
on their terms. So I talked with them,
played ball with them, and even lis-
tened to-their music. And do you know
what? I actually enjoyed their compa-
ny! They accepted me (I even became
the object of affection of about half a
dozen girls, mostly younger.)! The
challenge I had to face was accepting
their acceptance —- which, as you can
imagine, didn’t come right away. “This
isn’t supposed to happen,” I thought.

On the other hand, my few
black schoolmates — almost all of
them girls — hassled me in part for
spending so much time with whites,
and by the time I was 12, I had gar-
nered the reputation as a “honky-
lover.” Ironically, in the first place,
none of them talked to me much any-
way, so what was I supposed to do?
Stay by myself? Believe it or not, I
became an integrationist out of sheer
necessity! A

Whatever, what we originally
called integration was really nothing
more than desegregation — ‘allowing
the formerly “locked out” to partici-
pate in society without necessarily
building personal relationships with
them. As a result, we end up in poten-
tially explosive situations where a
wrong look or an insensitive remark
can set off a race riot. That’s why we
see so many of them these days.

‘ That may be the reason affir-
mative action progra_rns_, especially

concerning college admissions, have.

taken their share of criticism for insti-
tuting “quotas” for minority enroll-
ment. Of course, some administrators
will deny this, but a black fraternity
brother of mine (a white frat, by the
way) said ﬂatly that he got a full ride

to Pitt due to what he called a “quota

system.” Anyway, part of that ‘mindset
in minority cultures includes the often
Verbalized notion that “if you don’t

have so many of us in your institution,‘

we believe you’re trying to keep us
out” — whether true or not. I sympa-
thize with white students who resent
demands for more minority faculty and
staff and accusations of racism towards

a college or university for not acceding

to them.

Furthermore, some blacks will
tell you that integration has damaged
the black community, as those‘ who
“made it” supposedly left and began
spending their money and time else-
where. An exaggeration, for the most
part — they forget the riots after
Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination
nearly 30 years ago which drove many

« businesses and rniddle—class people out

of neighborhoods that came to resem-
ble war zones. Besides, at least in
Pittsburgh, most blacks still have other
blacks for neighbors, attend mostly-
black churches and, if they get to col-
lege, join black fraternities or sorori-
ties. Nowadays, I also hear calls for
some ill-defined sense of “unity” —
could that be the result of a few civil
rights leaders fearful of losing clout?
After all, in a truly just society, they
wouldn’t be needed. «

We likely won’t get the chance
to find out whether Yazoo City Little

Leaguers, or their parents, can get _ «

along —- and that’s a tragedy.
Because it’s not that integra-
tion didn’t work.
It just never got a chance.

minds: Why would this
football brood over Pitt
Stadium? Is it here to anni-
hilate Pitt’s struggling
football" program? Will this
be the expiration of civi-
lization as we know it?

Obviously, these ques-
tions had no answers. Not
yet, at least, Never before
in the history of Pitt athlet-
ics had -something like this
taken place.

Reprehensibly, new
chancellor Mark
Nordenberg fueled the
football people’s fire, so to
speak. After taking office,
Nordenberg only interested
himself with the political
aspects of the university,
making Pitt athletics ripe
for attack. Alienating him-
self from the average col-

lege student, Nordenberg ‘

believed that national pres-
tige would come from hav-

pions, not from the pres-
ence’ of meritorious sports

team didn’t win much last season,
Zatiti Kufag Moody was one of
10 recipients of the award at a

Moody always had a solid
background in winning academic

This past football season,
Moody started all 11 Panther
games at left defensive end. He
was one of the few Pitt defenders
who got consistent pressure on the
opposing quarterback, ﬁnishing
third on the team with 2.5 sacks.

usurped Nordenberg’s
authority and asseverated a
call for action. Jaynes sum-
moned any citizen in the case
of possible disaster.

“Any compatriot with
athletic prowess need pre-
pare for an eventual show-
down against whatever force
hide inside that_hideous
spacecraft in the form of a
football,” J aynes declared.

However, the natives
were restless and intimidat-
ed. Jaynes needed more per-
suasive powers to diminish
the growing concerns of the
populace.

Fortuitously, the football
creatures chose to remain
passive on July 2 as Jaynes
slowly built a frick/frack
football team. 0
On July 3, they attacked...

As daybreak approached,
activity could be spotted
around the hovering football.
Jaynes ordered a few former

Pitt alums to approach the

football, offering signs of
football peace (a pat on the
ass or a handshake).

Much to the shock of

thousands — no, make that
zillions — of Pitt alums and
students on the ground
observing the scene, the fly-
ing football suddenly spewed
outan infinite amount of
atomic footballs, fulminating
the former Pitt alums who
were offering peace.
;-_. . Rut row, Raggy! Pitt’s
world was set on its car.
With the speed of the quick-
est meteor, several million
football aliens dressed in
uniforms of colleges such as
Penn State, Ohio State, and
Florida Sta_te attacked the
Pitt people.

They didn’t ﬂy in alien
spacecraft, but ﬂew on some

sort of kicking tee-like
object. They rapidly dis-
charged those little atomic
footballs, killing or maiming
millions of Pitt alums and
students.

Basically, they destroyed
everything.

With the majority of
obliteration completed, the
football aliens subsided and
rested for another day of
bedlam.

This gave Jaynes the
chance to devise a master
plan that would send those
suckers back to Happy
Valley or wherever they
came from.

Naturally, Jaynes needed
a football genius to figure
out what was going on. So he
hired me to do a thorough
yet instantaneous investiga-
tion.

After calculating several
theorems and equations, I
deduced that Joe Paterno had

devised the whole plan and '

created several million foot-
ball androids to attack
Oakland and ruin Pitt foot-
ball forever.

He found this to be the
perfect time for numerous
reasons -— the foremost rea-
son being the decline of the
program on the field and in
the stands. Plus, with no
apparent attraction by Pitt’s
hierarchy in the world of ath-
letics, Pitt was seasoned for
the picking.

I knew only of one
course to defeat these bas-
tards.

On July 4, we got revenge.....

At last, I concurred with
Jaynes, believing that the
only way to stop these foot-
ball androids that were
threatening to demolish Pitt’s
storied football program was
to induce them on to the

was destroyed, the Cathedral
Lawn would do.

Having informed Jaynes
of my plan, he immediately
summoned all of Pitt’s all-
time greats. Dan Marino,
Tony Dorsett, Curtis Martin,
Billy West, Hugh Green,
Chris Doleman, Dietrich
Jells, and Rickey Jackson
were just a handful of coun-
tryman willing to step up and
reenergize Pitt’s football pro-
gram. It would be rude not to
mention that several‘ athletes
from other Pitt sports and
students eagerly participated
as well.

Jaynes also called
Johnny iMajors and Jackie
Sherril to throw together a
game plan in the quickest
possible manner. Knowing
what made-these androids
tick, Jaynes also called upon
me to help Pitt’s great coach-
es.

The coaches and I formu-
lated the plan we thought
could enable the good people
of Pitt to surpass Joe Pa and
his evil army that were
poised to destroy us.

At 1:00 p.m., Pitt’s
aggregation gathered at the
Cathedral Lawn, suited with
the finest in anti-alien foot-
ball equipment. Spectators
were few since the majority
of them killed or maimed,
but that didn’t deter our
heroes from defending Pitt’s
honor on the Fourth of July.

Joe Pa, sensing a com-
motion on the Lawn, prompt-
ly called upon his football
androids to complete the
destruction of Pitt football.

The opposition looked
fierce, kinda like they want-
ed to kill all of us. The play-
ers were scared; the coaching
staff and myself were, too.

Things looked bleak for
the Panther all—time team in
the first half. Dorsett was
brutalized, and Marino
couldn’t get a pass off. Had
it not been for a late second
quarter kickoff return for a
touchdown by Jells, we
would have been shut out.
Thankfully, a small glimmer
of hope shined on this once

proud program as we trailed

Joe Pa’s androids, 35-7.

The halftime chat was
nonexistent. We all thought
about our imminent death.
Then, like being hit by a bolt
of lightning, an idea struck
me. I knew that Joe Pa could
not construct the perfect
android and I deduced that
by throwing any form of
water substance on them,
they would short circuit.

Pumped up, the team
took the field. Johnny,
Jackie and I began our mis-
sion which was to throw any
beverage (water, Gatorade,
Jack Daniels), whatever was
lying around, onto the
androids.

The plan functioned with
ﬂawlessness. One-by—one we
short-circuited each android,
and by the five— minute-
mark in the fourth quarter,
Joe Pa’s android army had
fizzled out, and Pitt won the
game by forfeit —— a bigger
win than any of the nine
national championships.

New life breathed into
lovely Oakland. ‘After

' defeating the impossible,

teams like Miami (Fla.) and
Ohio State offered unworthy
competition. Pitt cruised to
an undefeated season the
next year and a national
championship and regained
the national prestige that
once stationed itself here.

It just goes to show you
that with some hard work,
talent, and lots of support,
Pitt can be ‘it’ again.

Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum churn their grey matter.

“amazing special effects,” it
became apparent that the
average filmgoer could enjoy
the film without churning his
grey matter. However this
movie’s script isn’t a snap-
together model. It involves
two complex genres —— the
1950s World War II war film
and Shakespeare’s “Henry
the Fifth”.

Independence Day
brings several characters into

one fighting unit against a.

common enemy, much like a
World War II adventure film.
The absence of a testos-
terone-fuled, miusclebound
central figure who can single
handedly destroy the enemy
creates a more believable
aspect. With this type of
film, you just have to make a
leap of faith, drop your quar-
ter (or $7.50—ed.), and pre-

super-hero in the movie,
each character becomes a
hero, in himself contributing
to the team. .

The “Henry the Fifth”
aspect comes mostly from
the President’s character. A
young, brash president who
participated in Operation
Desert Storm as a fighter
pilot, this president comes
off as a less than likely polit-
ical leader. As Prince Hal
was rewarded for his bravery
in “Henry the Fourth Part
II”, so has the President been
for Desert Storm. Now as the
aliens conduct their nefari-
ous plans, he realizes he has
failed the American citizens
as every major metropolitan
city lies in ruin. He must
redeem himself. ‘

Even the “go out and get
‘em boy” speech that Henry
the Fifth gives to his troops

Independence.Day.
Whitmore declares to his fol-
low ' Americans,
Independence Day will no
longer be an American
memorial, but a day for
everyone in the world to
acknowledge. Hip-hip-
hooray for Earth!!!

“ID4”, the best nickname
for this year’s summer
movie, has already grossed
over $100 million in six-
days, surpassing Jurrasic
Park, which took a whole
nine days to reach the mark.

The action sequences and
unabashed patriotic theme
are aspects of Independence
Day, and with the additional
sculpted blend of
Shakespeare and ‘50s war
film balances, are a pleasant
nature for a film.

The Chiettans headline ”A Celtic Celebration”

It is almost impossible to be
interested in Celtic music without
commenting on its artistic promiscu-
ity. In the 18th and 19th centuries,
when Scotch-Irish settlers were emi-
grating in droves for a variety of rea-
sons, American music became satu-
rated with the frothy drip of the jig
and reel to such an extent that wholly
“indigenous” styles of playing

formed around olde tyme, brogue-I

infected tunes. To separate Bill
Monroe’s bluegrass mandolin, or
even Bob Wills’ swing fiddle, from
their Scotch-Irish roots would prove
as deadly as removing the black
rhythmic drive from these high lone-
some sounds.

Forty years after Monroe’s hey-
day was shot down by Elvis’ shaky
hips, the contact with the Old
Country is as strong as ever, with
yanks like Garth Brooks selling out
week-long stands at arenas in Cork
and Dublin, inﬂuencing thousands of
Irish singer-songwriters to don cow-
boy hats and dream of Atlanta arena
fame.

The people of the Celtic diaspora
have not, however, forgotten‘ their

roots, and this summer, a tour called
‘A Celtic Celebration’ is bringing
representatives of three generations
of musicians, all strongly inﬂuenced
by Celtic traditional music, across
North America and even to the hum-
ble Pittsburgh’ metropolitan area.
Featuring the young,- ﬂamboyant fid-
dling of Ashley Maclsaac (from Cape
Breton, an area already known for
young, flamboyant music), Texan
“folkabilly” heroine Nanci Griffith,
and the “no-introduction-needed”
Chieftains, ‘A Celtic Celebration’
promises to be a testament to the oft-
misused term “living tradition”.

“Before the Chieftains began to play/
seven creamy pints came out on a
tray “ ——Christy Moore, Irish
singer/songwriter.

The Chieftains, contrary to state-
ments above, certainly deserve intro-
duction. Seldom touted as ‘less than
the greatest living purveyors of Irish
traditional music, and being Ireland’s
official cultural ambassadors, the
Chieftains have spent nearly a third
of a century bringing Irish music to

people from D.C. to Peking, and the
other way around. They have won
numerous Grammies for their
albums, including their Irish Evening
recording with tourmate Nanci
Griffith, and their cross—pollinating
country recordings. Live,’ the
Chieftains more than live up to their
reputation, playing hard and emotive
music with a strong sense of humor
that one cannot get from kissing
stones.

“Nanci Griffth? She's the kind of
woman I ’d like to take home... maybe
my Mom wouldn’t think I ’m so dan-
gerous anymore.” —Jesse Trbovich,
The Pitt News

For fifteen years, Nanci Griffith
has been one of country music’s enig-
mas; never bowing to the whip of the
trends which hold that genre in a
stranglehold, yet always retaining a
strong fan base amongst a wide vari-

ety of listeners. She can be likened in.

some respects to fellow Texan Lyle
Lovett. A long time compatriot of the

Chieftains and a part time resident of

Ireland, her Celtic inﬂuenced folka-

billy music has ‘made her a star in her »

adopted home. Griffith’s mousy
vocals and surprisingly attentive gui-
tar playing is identifiably based in the
‘70s folk scene, with a more worldly
view than most of her contempo-
raries.

“He’s a 19 or 20 year old punk who ’s
a fiddle genius and happens to look
great in a kilt. We all love him!” —
Mike J ., a local Canadian ex—patriot.

Opening ‘A ‘Celtic Celebration’
will be Ashley Maclsaac, a young,
dirty, inﬂammatory fiddler from Cape
Breton in Nova Scotia. Cape Breton
fiddlers are a bit of a rage in the folk
community these days, and with good

reason: the style is immediate, invig-

orating, and excitably danceworthy.
Maclsaac is certainly definable by

these same terms, but trebledg

Anyone who saw the Chieftains at
their last Pittsburgh appearance will
remember MacIsaac’s guest appear-
ance — he was the one who moved
like Iggy Pop while playing complex,
doubletime tunes on his fiddle. At

Dead M an
Written and Directed by Jim
Jarmusch

I had to take a trainall the way
to the suburbs to see the new Jim
J armusch film — a sort of spiritual
time/space psychedelic rock ‘n roll
Western with cameos by everyone
from Robert Mitchum to Iggy Pop
to the ‘inimitable Crispin Glover. It
was filmed in gorgeous black &
white (as all good Westerns should
be) by veteran Wim Wendersf cine-
matographer Robbie Muller, but
with all the atypical J armusch mas-
turbatory film school ostentation
and semi-symbolic camera angles,
I’m still not sure if it was worth the
trouble or not.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, July 10, 1996

The picture begins with a strum
of Neil Young’s endless, enigmatic
guitar chord that almost ends up
placating itself by the film’s end,
cueing the less observant among us
to notice that something has hap-
pened. Protagonist William Blake
(played to perfection by Johnny
Depp) enters scene one as a fresh-
faced, doe—eyed accountant from
Cleveland who has spent his last
cent on a train ride to the violent
and primitive Wild West town of
Machine. He comes to town in
search of a job working for the
father (“Mr. Dickinson” played by
Robert Mitchum) of a man he later
shoots in the film’s first question-
able death sequence, this time a
simple case of selfdefense.

Dickinson hires a team of psy-
chotic mercenaries to track down
Blake, who eventually befriends a
sort of metaphysical mulatto Indian
named “Nobody,”_who guides
Blake through the rest of the film.
Anyone familiar with Jarmusch’s
previous films (Down By Law,
Night on Earth) knows that they

and ambiguously brilliant as it is,
Dead Man is really nothing more
than eye candy for the starstruck,
and brain candy for the philosophi-
cally self—involved. It is without a
doubt an entertaining film, though I
wonder if Jarmusch wouldn’t be
just a little offended by such a

comment about a film with which i

I’m sure he intended to accomplish
so much more.

Dead Man is playing exclu-
sively at the Denis Theater in Mt.
Lebanon. All Wednesday shows

going to be a ﬁlm worth see-
ing came in the form of a
rather telling quote by director
Todd Solondz.

“I made the film because
“The Wonder Years” didn’t
match my experience,” he
answered, when asked about
the motivation behind his pre-
pubescent black comedy about
tortured adolescence; original-
ly titled F aggots and Retards .

Honesty like that only
comes along every so often,
especially coming from some-
one like Solondz, who made a
rather ungraceful exit from the
film business six years ago
after the completion of his
critically despised film about a
lonely New England play-
wright called Fear, Anxiety,
and Depression.

Welcome to the Dollhouse
is quite a different story alto-
gether. Somewhere in between
the painfully lengthy opening
shot of anti—hero Dawn
“Wienerdog” Wiener’s dis-
paraging rejection in the cold,
cruel void of the junior high
school cafeteria and the clos-
ing scene of a downtrodden
Dawn pathetically accepting
her poor station in life during
a glee club field trip, we get
the feeling that on one side or
the other, we’ve been there
before.

After being ridiculed as a
“lesbo” at lunchtime, Dawn
attempts to find solace in the
girl’s bathroom where the
female equivalent of- the
school bully forces her to take
a shit while she watches.
Business more or less contin-

ues as usual until the film’s
emotional turning point, in
which Dawn watches
Brandon, her main tormentor
and would-be rapist, attempt
to beg his way into a party
where he, just like Dawn, is
not wanted. The two eventual-
ly form a somewhat dysfunc-
tional friendship, although
when Brandon runs away
from home in order to avoid a
false drug charge, Dawn’s sit-
uation goes from bad to
worse. Steve, the high school
hunk who Dawn fantasizes
about at night, crushes her
dreams after she catches him
with the school slut. Then
Dawn gets punished by her
parents for not volunteering to
tear down her “Special
People” clubhouse, the one
and only place where she can
successfully find relief from
the harsh reality of seventh-
grade life.

As harmless as it might
look on paper, the majority of
this stuff hits a lot closer to
home than most of us would
like to admit, regardless of
whether we were on the
receiving or the delivering end
in our youths. It will be inter-
esting to watch Todd Solondz
in the future. After spilling his
guts in such an obviously
autobiographical film, I can’t
wait to see what he has to say
in Welcome to the Dollhouse:
The Later Years.

Closer to Far Away
Douglas Spotted Eagle
Windham Hill Records

The best way to describe the
music on Closer to Far Away is
ethereal. A fusion of traditional
instruments with those of the elec-
tronic age, the album could be
lumped in with those called “new
age,” but it is Variedenough to
avoid a monotony of sound

Closer to F ar Away opens with
a low electronic hum, overlaid
with a spoken word introduction in
the Native American Dine’ lan-
guage by Harry James, a tribal
elder. The rest of the album moves
from there, with piano and ﬂute

duets, Native American drums,
and ‘straight’ singing (singing
without actual words), and guitars
and synthesizers making appear-
ances on various tracks.

Anyone who has listened to
Japanese shakuhachi ﬂutes will
hear similarities between them and
Spotted Eagle’s ﬂute. Unlike the
Western classical ﬂute, which
tends to be played with a light
sound and high notes, the Native
American ﬂute played by Spotted
Eagle is lower, with more resonant
tones. The song “Nothing Like
Home” brings out the ﬂute most
notably and richly.

Track number two, “Closer to
Far Away” is reminiscent of ﬁlm
soundtracks and is probably the
closest to modern jazz. The
entrance of straight. singing later in

11

the song, however, dispels that
sound fairly well. “Arrival,” closes
the album with more Native
American voices and draws the
album to a sense of conclusion.
The album is varied and doesn’t
fade into background noise after
the ﬁrst track, like so many of its
kind.

He collaborated with Robbie
Robertson on his score for the
PBS series “The Native
Americans.” His earlier musical
career includes a stint playing gui-
tar and singing with a rock and roll
band which reached the pinnacle
of its success by opening ﬁve con-
certs for ZZ Top in the late 1970s.
He has been playing the Native
American ﬂute since he was
twelve years old.
