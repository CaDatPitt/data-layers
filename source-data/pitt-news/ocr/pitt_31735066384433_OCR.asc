Talks In WPIC Strike
Expected This Week

By DAN ROSENTHAL
Pitt News Staff Writer

An invitation to bring striking
workers at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (WPIC) and
administrators to the bargaining
table is expected to be extended by
a state mediator sometime this
week, The Pitt News has learned.

Some 120 WPIC psychiatric
assistants, clerks and business,
dietary, maintenance and house-
keeping workers, all members of
district 1 199-P of the National Union
of Hospital and Health Care
Employees, AFL-CIO, have been on
strike since Feb. 17.

Negotiations in the strike are
under the direction of the state
mediation service. The University,
who hires a majority of the W.P.I.C.
employees who are on strike, says it
is ready to bargain when invited to
do so by mediator Tom Quinn.

Union leaders say they also are
ready to bargain and have been

Travel Funds Spark

decision to allocate itself some
$1,000 in travel funds has come
under attack from the Student
Government Allocations Commit-
tee, which will formally challenge
the board at a judicial hearing
tomorrow evening.

This marks the first time ever a
standing committee has formally
challenged a SGB decision.

ready to do so since the strike
began.

“I’ve talked to both parties since
the strike began, and it’s true, they
both say they’ll meet,” Quinn said.
“But to this point, I hadn’t received
any indication that a meeting would
be productive.

‘ ‘If my judgement indicates there
isn’t any chance of movement at the
(bargaining) table, then don't call
a meeting,” he added. “It’s my
intention though, to contact the
parties and set up a meeting this
week.”

Jane Duffield, spokesman for.

W.P.l.C . , said operations are
“relatively normal” and all patients
in the clinics and in-patient units are
being cared for.

“We have a multi-disciplinary
team approach on each of our ﬂoors
and people other than psychiatric
assistants treat the patients, so the

stems from SGB funding of two
board members to the National
Entertainment and Campus Act-
ivities Association (NECAA) con-
ference in New Orleans this past
weekend.

Earlier this month, the SGB
requested $1,112 to send two
representatives to the conference,
but the Allocations Committee
subsequently recommended no
funding. Later, the same amount
was requested again by the SGB,
but the committee again recom-
mended zero funding.

Pledging to stay on the picket line until a new contract is ironed out, is this
striking employee of Western Psychiatric Institute and clinic. A state mediator
says he will ask both sides to come to the bargaining table sometime this week.

SGB Controversy

Under the SGB constitution, the
board is allowed to “reconstruct,”
or vote on, a budget, by passing a
third recommendation by the
Allocations Committee.

In this case, the SGB vote was
four in favor, none against and three
abstentions. _

According to the SGB constitu-
tion, the approval of ﬁve members
is needed for a measure to pass.
Robert’s Rules of Order, however,
states that all abstentions go to a
majority vote. SGB president Josh
Baylson, after consulting the rules,

WPGH Members Elect New G. M.

 Members of WPGH radio last
"night elected News Director Jeff

Manager, effective March 15.

Couch, a junior political science
major from York, Pa., garnered 30

Director Joe Enck’s 11 votes. Couch
succeeds Steve Vance as the top
official at the student-operated

enrolled at Pitt last fall, and became
news director in October.

Couch expressed high hopes for
the future of the radio station,

“I’d like to see WPGH become
the most important medium on
Pitt’s campus”, Couch said. “I
think we should strive to sound
more progressive than stations like
WYDD or WDVE. We always have
to remember that our audience is
very unique in that it is exclusively

follow this with a survey of

Couch also expressed optimism
about making the station an
open-air operation. WPGH is
broadcasted on carrier current,
which means only student dorm-
atories, the student union, and the
cafeterias are capable of receiving

ROTC:
Long Battle
Near End?

ByJIMMORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

ROTC accreditation-
unavailable to College of Arts
and Sciences cadets for ten
years—faces another challenge
tomorrow when the issue heads
for a floor vote by the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Council.

FAS, which has ﬁnal word on
the accreditation proposal,
passed two weeks ago by CAS
Council, will vote on the
following resolution:

‘ ‘That academic credit count-
ing towards the 120 credits
needed for graduation from
CAS, but limited to the 12
credits currently allowed for
non-CAS courses, be granted to
academic courses taught by the
Department of Aerospace
Studies (Air Force ROTC) and
the Department of Military
Science (Army ROTC).”

“The topic is perennial. The
arguments pro and con become
tired from frequent use,” CAS
Council member John
Townsend said recently of
accreditation for the programs,
which now enroll some 160
cadets, 75 percent of them CAS
students.

The ROTC accreditation con-
troversy was sparked in 1968
when, at the height of the
Vietnam war, FAS revoked
credit for military studies.)

In the years following that
decision the debate continued,
and, in 1975, FAS considered an
accreditation resolution similar
to the one now before them.
After much discussion, the
faculty voted 84 to 74 against
the proposal. '

Since the 1975 decision,
ROTC has waged an extensive
campaign to persuade FAS to
reconsider. Last March, ROTC
cadets circulated a petition
containing 2,500 student sig-
natures favoring ROTC accre-
ditation.

Later that month, The Pitt
News conducted an informal
public opinion poll in which 69
of 100 participating students
said they favored ROTC credit.

As a result of these
demonstrations of student
support, the Student

Government Board last year
called for a move to reinstate
ROTC credit.

‘Bakke Week'Is Held
By Pitt Student Groups

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt Student Coalition Against Racism (SCAR) and the Black
American Law Students Association (BALSA) last week sponsored
“Bakke Educational Week,” a two-day slate of programming aimed at
gaining support for a nationwide movement to overturn the Bakke
“reversediscrimination” decision and defending affirmative action in
education and industry.

Both BALSA and SCAR contend that should Bakke win an appeal
currently under review by the United States Supreme Court, a precedent
will be set for rulings in the more than 2000 “discrimination” cases
before the courts. Speakers featured at the conference included
representatives of women and minorities in industry, students in
professional schools and representatives from the professional world.

A statement released by SCAR calls for affirmative action programs to
balance the ratio of white doctors to minority doctors in the United
States. The ratio of white doctors to the total white population is 1 in 700
while the minorities are as follows: Black—1 in 3,800, Native
American——1 in 20,000 and Latin American——1 in 30,000.

On Sept. 16, 1977, a California Court handed down a decision in favor
of Allan Bakke, a 37-year-old aeronautical engineer, who charged
reverse discrimination after being denied admission to the University of
California at Daivs’ medical school. Bakke claimed that the school’s
affirmative action program, which reserves 16 places in every entering
class for minority students (some of which were accepted with lower
grade point averages and test scores than Bakke), was the cause of his
rejection.

“The Bakke case is not just the Bakke case,” said Susan Schiller,
coordinator of Pitt’s Learning Skills Center. “Bakke seems indicative of
the general trend against minorities and women, for rights as human
beings. If Bakke wins, our cause will be pushed back more than 20 years
on gains previously made.”

Martha Munsh, a professor of law in Pitt’s School of Law, expressed
her views an affirmative action in relation to women in the work force.

“Women have been locked into jobs in the work force with little or no
chance for advancement.” Munsh said, “The_most far-reaching cause
for this is sex-based discrimination and employers that set different
standards for men and women”.

Munsh said that employers often resort to “subtle practices ” to
legally discriminate against women. She cited a case in which the
National Baseball League required that all umpires be at least 5’ 10’ ’ and
weigh at least 180 pounds, a practice that would automatically disqualify
the vast majority of women.

Munsh also noted the substantial differences in the average incomes
of men and women. Figures on full time employment show that women
earn $6,488 per year, while men earn approximately 43 percent more, or
$11,468, annually.

In her closing remarks Munsh stated, “If affirmative action were
eliminated I fear to wonder what further ramifications would face not

1:

only minorities but also women.”

HONORS PROGRAM

  

UN IEIED FIELD EXPERIENCE
IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

The University Honors Program announces a unique educational opportunity for qualified un-
dergraduates with interests in international relations. In cooperation with the United Nations
Organization and The National Collegiate Honors Council, the UHP intends to sponsor one or more
students at the UN in New York City for Fall Term, 1 978.

  

  

The United Nations Semester will integrate academic and experiential learning in the study and
appreciation of international forces and cultural differences. The formal academic’ dimension will
consist of a series of intertacking seminars relating to the two general topics of intemationalism and
conflict mediation. Academic credit will accrue. In addition, the Semester will provide faculty and
student participants with a unified field experience. Complementing the seminars, students will
benefit from the presence in New York of numerous experts in the field of international relations and
culture. Guest lecturers, direct field research and experience, and guidance in independent projects

from those active in international relations will be a fonnal part of this Semester. Students will be
housed near the UN and will be eligible for student discounts throughout New York City.

Acceptance into this program is competitive and limited. Interested applicants must have a
minimum QPA of 3.25 and present a brief essay to the UHP by March 3. This essay must indicate
your reasons for-wanting to spend a term at the UN. The essay must clearly consider what you
think you bring to this educational opportunity and what you hope to bring back to the University
from participation. The UHP is currently pursuing possibilities for scholarship assistance. Selection
is by a faculty committee.

Junketing?

The Student Government Judicial Board will be deciding an im-
portant question Tuesday night, the answer to which is at least
peripherally related to the philosophy behind the present Student
Government Board constitution. Unfortunately, the question
comes up in a context that puts the Board in a touchy, if not an em-
barrassing, position.

The SGB Allocations committee twice recommended against
providing funds for two Board members to attend the National En-
tertainment and Campus Activities Association (NECAA) con-
ference in New Orleans this past weekend. Recently, the Board
voted 4-0-3 to overrule the second Allocations recommendation.

Under the SGB constitution, ﬁve affirmative votes are required
for such‘ a ruling. Board president Josh Baylson, interpreting
Robert's Rules of Order, decided that the three abstentions should
count as affirmative votes, thereby making the effective vote 7-0.
The Allocations Committee has requested the Judicial Board to
render a decision on this interpretation.

Subsequent to Baylson’s interpretation, he and Board member
Jan Medoff went to the conference in New Orleans, at a total cost
to students of over $1,100. While a charge of unnecessary junketing
may or may not be warranted here, Baylson’s journey to the con-
ference casts him and the whole Board in a bad light. New Orleans
is an awfully nice place to visit in February, and to grant oneself a
free trip there through a controversial interpretation is questionable
political practice at best.

A more important issue, however, is whether the philosophy
behind the present SGB constitution is sound. As things now stand,
there are no checks on Board decisions-—inc1uding decision in-
volving the Board itse1f—other than the Judicial Board. Commit-
tees like Allocations serve in a strictly advisory role. The board is
free to overrule at any time.

Board member Dave Hesidence says the present arrangement is a
good one. .

“Six or seven years ago there was a sort of ‘bicameral’ SGB
structure,” he told The Pitt News last night. “The Board spent all
its energies on petty politics. Under the present system there is a
tradeoff between democracy and good management, and'we think
students are more concerned with good management.”

Hesidcnce is right about the tradeoff, but it may not be for
him—or any other Board member—to decide what is best or what
students want in this case. The Judicial Board decision on Tuesday
will touch on this issue, but it may be that a more in-depth con-
stitutional review is in order—especially if the present semi-
autocratic SGB structure is being abused. The same circumstances
that can, as Hesidence says, provide for good management, can
also provide the means to excessiveness.

All of this, of course, begs the question of whether the NECAA
conference was worth the $1,100 in student activities fees spent on»
it, no matter who went.

Programming has been a defunct organization on this campus
for some time. The rationale behind the trip down south, as stated
last night by Hesidence, was to establish connections with people
who have knowledge of programming, especially knowledge of
how to organize a committee that can handle on-campus enter-
tainment. In addition, Baylson and Medoff were authorized to con-
tract with groups showcased at the conference. ..

Whether the two Board members’ attendence in New Orleans
will result in some kind of effective campus programming remains
to be seen.

Still, it seems that something better might have been done with
the $1 ,100—and perhaps with the similar sum that went to finance
Sharon Starzynski’s and Di_ane Behers’ recent trip to the
Southeastern Inter-Fraternity Council conference in Atlan-
ta—especially in view of the fact that other University represen-
tatives attended each conference. The circumstances under which
both trips were approved (over the objections of the Allocations
Committee) raise important questions of where the Board is
heading.

Russian Roulette At The Housing Office

I would like to take this
opportunity to congratulate the
University Housing Office for what
could only be described as a
“bravura” performance during last
week’s housing contract ﬁling
process. Perhaps “process” is not
the appropriate word—maybe
“catastrophe” would be more
applicable.

Last week saw the unequal
distribution of housing contracts-
some students didn't even get their
housing contracts until Thursday

morning, when they were still in
class, or couldn't get to them until
Thursday afternoon—minutes

'before the housing office reached

its 2,300-person quota for upper-
class students. The mad rush for
accomodations, which was precipi-
tated by the housing ofﬁce’s call for
immediate action, left some 500
dorm residents on an endless
waiting list, deprived of their room
for next year, and quite possibly
out on the street come next
September.

Abortion Rights Defended By NOW

We, the Pittsburgh campus
chapter of NOW, have become
concerned recently with the grow-
ing strength and effectiveness of
attacks mounted by the anti-abort-
ion movement against the right of
women to have abortions as
determined by the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1973 decision. We would
like to use this space to address the
moral questions raised by this
(problem as we see them.

"It is generally assumed by those
who are against abortion that
abortion constitutes murder and
that sanctioning the use of abortions
sets a dangerous precedent as it
allows so-called innocent lives to be
taken. We believe it is no more
immoral for a woman to terminate a
pregnancy through abortion than it
is for the political and military
leaders of a nation to send men into
a war, even when a country is under‘
threat of invasion by another nation.
In both cases, at stake is the
independence and autonomy of an
entity--a human being in the one
case, a nation in the other. We are
not stating that it is immoral for the
leaders of a country to decide that
the lives of young men will be
sacrificed in order that the
autonomy, independence, ideals
and lifestyle of a nation be
preserved, but rather that it is no

less moral for millions of women to
decide to have abortions in order to
preserve their individual autonomy
and dignity as human beings.

What is seldom addressed by
anti-abortionists is what is in reality
at stake in this question. If a woman
does not have abortion available to
her as a third alternative (given the
less than 100 percent effectiveness
of contraceptives), she must either
be willing to live without inter-
course or must enter into every act
of intercourse willing to give up her
ability to project her life into the
future and have control over its
course.

We do not feel that the latter two
constitute reasonable alternatives.
Sex is not only an important
biological drive, but also a unique
and invaluable means of commun-
ication within a relationship. And
while fate, of necessity, determines
the lives of human beings to some
extent, it should not be allowed to so
persistently determine the course of
a person’s life in so major a way.
We hope that the statments of some
recent anti-abortion commentators
in these pages do not implicate a
return to Victorian “morality” and
“responsibility.”

Watch Those Generic Drugs

In response to your article,
“Local Toiletry Costs Vary,” on
Feb. 17: It said, “When buying
prescribed drugs, try to purchase a
generic drug rather than a
name-brand drug. Generic drug
manufacturers can sell their
products at lower prices because

‘they do not have expensive

advertising campaigns.”

While this could, in fact, be partly
true, brand-name drugs often cost
more because of the extensive
bioavailablitity testing and product

“released” from the inert binding

a name-brand product. The

that just because a comparable

generic level doesn’t necessarily
make it as good or better than a

Patricia A. Morrison‘
Third Year

When I asked one housing ofﬁce
ofﬁcial about the plight of these 500
students, his nonchalant reply was
“What was wrong with these
students if 2,300 others got their
contracts in without difficulty.” I
though this was a “worthy” reply.
These students would merely have
displaced those students who now
have housing, not making the
situation any better, and there are
some students on this campus who
have to concern themselves with
trivial matters like classes and
mid-terms.

I am sure the University
administration would have appreci-
ated it if many resident students
had skipped class and any
mid-terms they had for however
long it would have taken to wait for
the housing contract, and then
stand in line outside of G-33 and
the housing office to get it

‘ processed.

This situation is inexcuseable. At
a minimum, I expect some dialogue
between University officials and
students on this matter. Perhaps
with a lot of work, some solution
can be found that will better the

_housing situation and make the

housing application process less
“Russian roulettish”—even if I’m
the only student who wants to do
the talking and seek some
solutions.

Spinks No Kid

I am writing in response to the
article on the Muhammad Ali/ Leon
Spinks ﬁght written by Mark"
Murphy and appearing in the Feb.
17, issue of The Pitt News.

Ali lost to the heavyweight
champion of the world. Murphy
says, “Muhammad Ali is through,
ﬁnished, done,” yet, Murphy says
Ali is still the greatest. I don’t see-
his meaning. Yes, we all know ‘ ‘age
has robbed us of Muhammad Ali.”
But age is not the only theft;
strength and courage have played a
great part.

Second, you should never refer to
a 24-year-old man as a kid. A male
child becomes a man at the age of
16. Also, I don’t think that three
wives and an illegitimate child
made any difference in Ali’s getting
into the ring and ﬁghting.

Vietnam: An Ocean of Contradictions

By GARY GOVERT

Dispatches—Michael Herr. Winners
and Losers—Gloria Emerson. A
Rumor of War—Philip Caputo. The
new books on Vietnam, on the war.
Books that tear at the soul, I under-
stand. Diaries of pain.

I am a Vietnam veteran. It says so on
my DD214N, my certificate of
separation from active duty. The ser-
vice and campaign ribbons rotting in a
trunk somewhere conﬁrm it.

My Vietnam was not, however, the
Vietnam of the veterans in the books.

I have no nightmares. The ship from
which I assisted in the long-range bom-
bardment of unseen targets seldom drew
within reach of enemy artillery. I have
no shrapnel in my legs, no limbs
missing. None of my friends were
killed. One guy did have a few ﬁngers
ripped off by the breech mechanism of a
5-inch gun, but that was an accident.

If Vietnam was, for the new
writers on the war, an emotionally
scarring, grunt’s-eye-view of the
Mekong Delta, it was for me a brief

journey on a sea of contradictions.

6 Although nominally opposed to

the war, I was at the helm of a de-
stroyer escort when, in 1972, it
steamed into the coastal waters east
of Indochina. During the ensuing
months, following intensive night-
time bombardments of nobody-
knew-what, I sang anti-war songs
and wrestled daily with 55-pound
shells and powder canisters during
re-arming details.

To be 20 years old in the early
1970’s; to be under the inﬂuence of
a newfound political conscious-
ness—and yet, at the same time,
to be with the United Stat_es Navy in
Vietnam. It was an invitation to
participate in all manner of
absurdities.

It was to cast a vote for George
McGovern from the South China
Sea. It was to take a burden of guilt
and questioning to the chaplain,
only to be given absolution in the
form of a verbal tract on the
practical and moral necessity of the
American cause. It was to read the
epic fantasies of J .R.R. Tolkein
while the recoil of the forward
mount shivered through the ship,
rattling the pages of Middle Earth.

And during those last few days in
January 1973—after the cease-
fire had been signed but before it
had taken effect—it was ﬁnally to

‘stem while the ground troops joc-
keyed for position _in the DMZ, to
listen while the American naval
gunﬁre support roared from a thin,
gray line of destroyers, and to watch

V while the orange sheets of napalm

streaked across the distance
without sound.

The contradictions that ran
through my experience in Vietnam
were such that I was never quite
satisﬁed with any argument, pro or
con, that tried to assess the morality
of America's involvement in the
conﬂict.

There was, of course, little
difficulty in rejecting the pragmatic
pseudo-morality of those who
sought to justify the American
presence. My superiors, I could
see, were not exactly motivated by
concern for the South Vietnamese
people. I recognized the imperial-
ism, even before I knew it by that
name.

Actually, I wanted very much to
identify—as I did in almost every
other way—with the men and
women then in college, who seemed
so sure in their condemnation of the
war. They were, for me, the visible
evidence of a social and intellectual

SIDELINES

reality far removed from the one
in which I felt myself trapped. I
wanted to identify with them, but I
could not.

Envious as I was of my
uninhibited, somewhat romanticiz-

ed role models, I could not share
their enthusiasm for opposition to
the war. Perhaps it was because I
was a coward, afraid to face the
consequences of the actions such a
decision would require. Or perhaps
it was because I recognized, even
then, the herd mentality that
pervaded the anti-war movement,
the discomforting psychological
attraction of the “cause,” the fact
that so many who knew so little were
able to decide so much. (I did not
realize until later that most popular
causes are espoused under these
conditions.)

Ultimately, I did my duty, as the

I

war’s apologists deﬁned it. I was
uncomfortable with what I did, but
the seemingly irresolvable nature of
the situation helped to reduce moral
questions to a relatively minor
burden.

Now, five years removed from
Vietnam, the books begin to
appear—the polished prose of
conviction, the diaries of pain—and
I still cannot decide.

The absurdities I lived a few years
ago remain part of my conception of
Vietnam. Free now from the
consequences of disobedient opin-
ion, I am tempted to say I should
have spoken out, should have
resisted. Yet the ambiguities of the
present situation, as well as the
past, are stacked against a clear-cut
moral decision. The new regime in
Vietnam is apparently even worse
than the one we supported. On this
side of the Paciﬁc, people continue
to follow the herd in the making of
moral choices. Still again, the herd
may not be wrong.

In a way, I hope the confusion of
my experience and my analysis will
be knit into some kind of
comfortable clarity when I read the
new books on the war. Michael
Herr’s book, I understand, is
beautifully written —-the “shedding
of an obsession.” As for me, my
usual didacticism crumbles when it
comes to Vietnam.

Friendship Aim Of Hill District Youth Club

By BARB voss

At 3 p.m. every weekday, 40 to 60
black children race to the corner of
Terrace and Robinson Streets to
attend Friendship Youth Club,
located in the basement of
Friendship Church, which began in
1975 under the direction of
Belleﬁeld Presbyterian Church.
The club gives college students the
opportunity to care for Hill District

children aged eight to 12, and now_

operates under the direction of
Todd Jawson, a senior urban
studies major at Pitt. Jawson heads
a staff of ﬁve student coordinators,
who direct 20 counselors and guide
the children’s activities.

Although at ﬁrst glance a typical
youth club, Friendship Youth Club
has unusual goals. The club staff
focuses on teaching the children to
have a personal relationship with
Jesus Christ and provides a variety
of activities, from guitar and sewing
lessons to roller skating and hiking.
The club also offers an academic
tutoring program to all children
willing to stay an hour and a half
after the usual club time.

Besides emphasizing group
interaction, each Friendship Youth
Club staff member tries to know a
few of the children personally.
Coordinator, Marsha Scholl, took
her 7-year-old friend Jason to the
Monroeville Mall during the
Christmas season. “It was a riot!”
she said. “He tugged me down the
length on the entire mall to get to
see Santa Claus.”

Friendship Youth Club also has

problems. Understaffing hinders
the development of one-to-one
relationships, between counselors
and children. “I'd like to touch base
with almost everyone there,” said
Jawson, “but it’s difficult to run
Youth Club without _ becoming
watered down.” Most counselors
experience conflict between the
demands of a full-time student and
a four to 10 hour commitment to the
club per week.

But counselors also experience
personal growth. “There's so much
to learn in terms of living,” said
Jawson. “I don’t really know
what the kids are thinking or
feeling." Some counselors said
they would like to live in the Hill
District next year, going beyond
youth club to involvement in the
community.

How do the children respond to
the Friendship Youth C1ub’s
approach to meeting their needs?
“They might complain about the
activities at times, but when youth
club stops for a while (such as over
Christmas break), everyone cons-
tantly asks when it will start again,”
said Wendy Jacoby, a philosophy

» and urban studies major at Pitt.

One of the children once asked
white counselor Keith Kusbit,
“Keith, are you black?”

In the future, Jawson hopes the
Friendship Youth Club program will
provide more children with close
relationships by increasing the
number of counselors. J awson also
intends to increase interaction
between parents and Youth Club
staff.

“The Leisure Learning courses
give students something to do in
their spare time that does not cost a
lot of money." said program
coordinator Lorraine Schmitt.

you

Two-hundred students partici-
pated in the first ﬁve Leisure
Learning courses. offered in the
fall and winter terms of 1975.
Today, Leisure Learning courses
also are taught during spring
session. participation has grown to
523. and has expanded to 22
courses.

For the active student, there are
modern. jazz. disco and ballroom
dancing and table tennis. For the
desk—bound. there are backgam-
mon, bridge. astrology. macrame
and basic guitar.

We‘re not sophisticated enough
to make experts out of every person
attending our courses.” said
program administrator Terry Mi-
lani. Some mixology students.
however. have found work as
bartenders after completing the
course.

The University offered to pay the
Leisure Learning programs ex-
penses for five years. Schmitt said.
but in less than a year. the program
received enough money to run
itself.

“We try to keep the cost of the
courses at $10." Schmitt said.
“Some courses are more expensive
than others because there is more
equipment needed." For instance.
the cost of beads and jute is
included in the S17 macrame class
fee.

Leisure Learning classes are less
expensive than other such classes.
however. “It costs our students $22
for 22 hours of ceramic classes."

\;.;.

said ceramics teacher Carole
Stainier. “At Carnegie Institute.
the same kind of course costs $58
for about 33 hours of instruction."

Stanier. like other Leisure
Learning instructors, is a profes-
sional. She is a member of the
Associated Arts, and teachers at
Chatham College and at Pitts-
burgh's Arts and Crafts Center.

“If we can't find teachers inside
the University. we’ll go outside.
and investigate any possibilities."
Milani said. “Teachers are paid
according to their standing and
expertise.

“We welcome proposals from
anyone interested in teaching a
course." Milani continued. “and
we provide administration. regis-
tration. space and advertising.“

Students say they get more out of
the Leisure Learning courses than
they expected.

“I expected more direction. but
I'm glad I'm not getting it." said
a ceramics student.

Maxine Bruhns. director of the
Nationality Rooms program. signed
up for auto mechanics instruction
“because I have a car and wanted
to know how to take care of it. I
think everyone should know the
basics. besides starting a car and
going." Bruhns said.

Auto mechanics teaches students
to avoid garage ripoffs. said
Schmitt. Sudents also save money

because they may work on their
own cars during the course.

A disco dancer said she took the
most popular Leisure Learning
course because. “I wanted some
fun exercise and I don't think the
typical, strenuous exercise classes
are fun."

About half of the disco dancing
students are men. “We have fellas
in all of our courses,” Schmitt said.
"One guy wanted to enter the class
that had the most girls per guy‘
ratio. so we put him in auto
mechanics."

Auto mechanics classes are held
in the Student Union’s loading dock
area. Physical fitness and slimnas-
tics lessons are taught in Trees Hall
exercise rooms. Students with

cards have use of the A track.
multipurpose and weight rooms.
and are free to use the Trees Hall
pool after classes.

“Our only limitation now is the
space to expand our program."
Milani said. "The Student Union.
where most of the courses are
taught. is used by other organiza-
nons.too.

As long as the interest in Leisure
Learning holds. none of the
program s classes will be cancel-

led. Milani said. And there are
plans to add classes in origannﬁﬁja

What’s the most addicting agent
in America today? Drugs‘? Alcohol?
No, television. Despite the growing
interest in leisure sports such as
skiing and tennis, TV is still the
great American pastime. College
students ‘were weened on the
tube,—denying you’ve ever
watched the box is like admitting
you’ve never eaten a hot dog, gone
to a baseball game or kissed your
mother.

Soap operas are among the most
popular TV shows on campus. They
compose most of daytime viewing,
and are so attractive that some
students schedule classes around
their favorite. Soap operas give the
viewer the chance to get personally

involved with the plot; everything
that happens to the world’s
population in a generation happens
to a 15-character cast in a matter of
months. It’s not unusual for love
affairs, pregnancies, abortions,
divorces, terminal diseases and
murders to bombard one family
with such frequency that students
wonder if they lead dull lives.
‘Soaps also appeal because they
stimulate gossip——heaven to a soap
freak is meeting another soap freak
who views the same program. In
such a meeting, the topic of
discussion is planned for hours.
Other daytime favorites are
game shows. The thrill is in the
crucial moment when the answer
pops from the lips of the contestant
with barely two seconds remaining

on the clock, and he is showered
with cars, exotic trips and money.
It’s the American dream of getting
something for nothing.

The blood-and-guts series also
rank high with students. Shows like
“Kojak” expose the student to the
rough, animalistic world of crime
and the supercop who’s got it all in
the palm of his hand. He knows
he’ll get the guy, and so do
you—but you have to see how he
does it.

“Starsky and Hutch” may be the
most popular of these programs.
Aside from furnishing enough
action and machismo to cause any
college man to identify with its
stars, it gives women a chance to
ogle a Jewish god and a
Scandinavian stud.

Breaking Down The College TV Habit

Situation comedies fare well; if
you’ve got an interest, they’ve got
a show for it—ghetto children,
Southerners, city dwellers, the
rising black, the psychologist, the
liberated woman, the bigot and
many more. These shows deal with
heavy subjects in a light manner.
If you agree with what they say,
you’ll recognize it. If not, you can
shrug it off as just another TV
show.

“Soap” and “Happy Days”
seem to be major attractions at
Pitt. “Soap” allows the student to
explore, in a semi-satirical way,
everything in a soap opera and
more. “Happy Days” appeals to a
college audience because it is about
the young, taking a lighthearted
view of experiences like the first
date and the senior prom. It also
presents experiences those in the
1970’s will never know—like
getting the first TV on the block.
More importantly, it has given us
the Fonz.

show a time and place far, far away

This year, despite the
absence of faculty sponsors who
helped ROTC in 1975, cadets
took their case to CAS Council,
which supported the cadets by a
vote of 7-3.

The arguments—on the
surface—appear simple. ROTC
cadets want credits for courses
they believe are no different
than other “professional”
courses now given CAS credit.

Opponents say ROTC is a
“different animal,” that the
military shouldn’t be treated as
“just another profession,” and
that the objectives of ROTC are
contrary to those of the
University.

But from here these simple
arguments seem to diverge and
become more complex. Each
side accuses the other of
distorting and skirting the issue
until it seems no one knows
what the issue really is.

In addition to ROTC’s

o principal complaint that CAS-

’ ROTC students must take an
overload of credits, they argue
that Pitt should compare itself
with other schools.

Of the 300 colleges and

universities across the nation
which offer ROTC programs,
Pitt is among only eight schools
which deny credit for military
studies. And, within the
University, ROTC courses
receive partial credit in four
schools.

Another main argument for
ROTC accreditation is that in
the past decade ROTC pro-
grams and society itself have
changed. Therefore, according
to a FAS position papei;.by Air
Force cadets Terry Regan and
Scott Wagner, the University
should reassess its position.

ROTC spokesmen also say
they want to conﬁne the debate
to the content and worth of
ROTC courses, and not to
extend it to the larger question
of the military’s place in the
University.

History professor Samuel
Hays is among those opposed to
accredidation.

“The ROTC debate has
raised the wrong question—the
effectiveness of the training
rather than the goals and
purposes of the University-
which is the question to which

we should address ourselves,”
Hays has written in a letter to
the FAS.

“No,” says Wagner, “that’s
off the subject. People are using
emotional appeals, and we’re
asking them to approach this
question unemotionally and
open-minded. ’ ’

“People don’t understand
the issue as we’re trying to put
it,” Wagner continued. “We’re
only asking for credit for the
courses we work hard in—-
courses I think are just as good
and just as demanding as any
others in CAS.”

Townsend, who strongly
opposes ROTC credit, views
military studies differently.

“These are not the tools of
training of just another pro-

fession like business or
engineering for which CAS
credits are granted,”
Townsend said. “This is a

profession whose goals are
antithetical to those of the
liberal arts, and that anti-
thetical relationship should not
be ignored." -

Cadets claim they study

ROTC Credit, A Ten-Year Debate, Faces FAS

subjects such as communica-
tions in much the same manner
as other CAS students.

“Our subjects are shaded by
the military, just as any
business course is shaded by
the business world,” Wagner
said.

Yet, according to Wagner,
cadets cannot, for example,
take a communications course
from the speech department as
a substitute for an ROTC
communication course because
their learning and “progress”
must be continually evaluated
by ROTC instructors as an
important part of the program.

Here, opponents of'ROTC
credit again take exception.
Hays sees this as an example of
ROTC being “subject to control
elsewhere.” Decisions on cur-
riculum and faculty are “sub-
ject to ultimate decisions
external to the University,”
Hays says.

However, the ultimate
decision on ROTC accredidation
will be up to the University.
Another close vote is expected
by FAS tomorrow.

According to FAS Dean
Jerome Rosenberg, there has
been ‘ ‘much less activity than in
1975. I haven’t sensed as much
strong feeling on the issue. But
I may not have my hand on the
pulse of the faculty,” he said.

Rosenberg also said that,
although the faculty is essen-

tially the same on that rejected
ROTC credit in 1975, “another
three years have elapsed, and
the irritation (of certain faculty
members) has probably dimin-
ished somewhat.”

But, no matter what the final
decision, some irritation is

bound to linger. To ROTC
cadets a favorable decision
tomorrow would mean the relief
of what they consider an unfair
burden.

To those against such a
decision, it would be, as

Townsend says, “a message to
our students that the military is
just another profession, and the -
ROTC is just another academic
program.”

By M. PATRICK MONAI-IAN
“Colna” Pitt News Staff Writer
United Artists

Directed by Michael Critchton

You will never feel easy about
surgery again, no matter how
minor, after seeing the recently
released “Coma.”

The ﬁlm is a straight-forward
suspense thriller that has been
adapted from Robin Cook’s best-
selling book. lts subject matter is
both fascinating and frightening:
Patients in a major Boston hospital
are being unexplainably put into
comas during their operations.

The plot of “Coma” is strong and
the settings realistic. Several
excellent performances enhance the
suspenseful story line.

Beautiful French actress
Genevieve Bujold superbly plays a
young, hardworking surgical resi-
dent who stumbles onto the
misdoings when a friend of hers
goes into a coma after undergoing
an abortion.

While researching the reasons
why, she meets a young athlete in
for a simple knee operation who also
is later put into an unexplainable
coma, reinforcing her initial
hunches.

Of course, she is the only one at
the hospital who believes people are
being purposely put into comas and

goes on throughout the movie trying
to persuade her boyfriend and the
head of the hospital about her
ﬁndings.

Michael Douglas, in one of his
first major starring roles, is
passable as Bujold’s lover and
fellow member of the surgical team.

Veteran actor Richard Widmark
plays the head of the hospital,
turning from a fatherly adviser
trying to shake off the investigative
efforts of Bujold into a sinister
mastermind with evil intentions.

ARTS

In minor roles are Elizabeth
Ashley as the evil head of the
. institution where the coma patients
are transferred to, and Rip Torn as
the chief anesthesiologist who is
suspected of wrong doings by
Bujold during the operations.
“Coma” has plenty of suspense-
ful moments, with Bujold climbing
in and out of hospital ventilation
shafts, lurking around deathly quiet
hospital corridors, and, later, being
chased by a ski-masked man who
wants to brutally end her investigat-
mg.

Genevieve Bujold portrays a young doctor who becomes suspicious about the
number of patients slipping into comes after simple surgery in “Coma.”

Weekend in L.A.
George Benson
Warner Brothers

It would be hard not to notice the
release of George Benson’s latest
album, “Weekend in L.A.” Big
posters and advertisements an-
nouncing the event adorn the record

 shops. But in this case, the album is

worthy of this acclaim.

“Weekend in L.A.” was record-
ed last fall at three concerts at the
Roxy in Hollywood..The double disc
has surprisingly good sound quality
for a live album, giving the natural
feeling of live music with studio
quality.

The performance opens with
“Weekend in L.A.,” the title cut.
The song exhibits the quality work
found throughout the album.
Benson’s guitar playing emerges
sweet, light and crisp, bouncing
with the beat and forming a melody

hich stands alone and is also a part
of the whole.

Keyboard men Ronnie Foster and
Jorge Dalto contribute to the music.
Their work flows with the tempo,

and the changing chords creates
new sceneries of sound as the song
progresses.

The work of Benson, Foster, and
Dalto is augmented by Stanley
Banks on bass, Harvey Mason on
drums, Ralph MacDonald on
percussion and Phil Upchurch on
rhythm guitar. These musicians
create the tempo and form the
tight instrumental background that

allows Benson and the Keyboard /

men to perform well.

Following “Weekend in LA.” is
Benson’s rendition of the classic
“On Broadway." Benson increases
the tempo from the original song
and adds a personal touch—vocal
improvisation.

In “Down Here on the Ground”
Benson exhibits rich vocals and
enjoyable lyrics, but his voice really
shines in “The Greatest Love of
All,” a pretty ballad with a nice
message.

In “California P.M.” the men on
percussion and rhythm guitar speed

 Audience Almost Comatose After “Coma”

Genevieve Bujold inspects comatose patients in this scene from “Come.”

The suspense builds logically,
but is not overdone. This
straightforward depiction is effec-
tive in adding to the realistic and
chilling impact of the film.

Michael Crichton, a doctor

himself, must be commended for
his excellent screenplay adaptation
from Cook’s book, and also his
subtle, yet suspensefully powerful,
direction.

Jerry Goldsmith’s gripping score

is an asset to “Coma.”

“Coma” will have you sitting on

the edge of your seat as you root for .

Bujold, and much queasier about
future surgical visits to the hospital.

“Brecht on Brecht” (1 Waste

By MICHAEL X. ZELEN AK

‘ ‘Brecht on Brecht’ ’
Pittsburgh Playhouse
Directed by James Prescott

“Brecht on Brecht" is not a play,
but “a compilation of Brecht’s
dramatic and poetic writings”
arranged and translated by George
Tabori. The piece is loosely tied
together by Brecht’s testimony at
the United States House Un-
American Activities Committee
witch hunt in 1947 after which
Brecht left the United States to
settle in East Germany. There, he
and his wife, actress Helene
Wiegel, founded the Berliner
Ensemblepwhich became a show-
case for his plays and his theories of
the epic theater.

The script itself did little justice to
one of the century’s greatest
playwrights, author of such brilliant

up the tempo, creating a moving
beat. Benson keeps up with some
quick plucking all the way through
the song.

On the second disc, “lt’s All in
the Game" contains more fine
vocals and a savory piano. The
following piece, “Windsong,'
possesses a strong beat. Benson’s
guitar, light but emphatic, spices up
the selection. In “Ode to a Kudu”
Benson’s guitar, crisp yet melodic,
creates a soft, sweet mood, aided by
some delicate work on the
keyboards.

The ﬁnal side starts out with
“Lady Blue,” Benson gives this
Leon Russell song a special
character with his easy vocals. The
following cut is “We All Remember
Wes,” a well-composed Stevie
Wonder song.

The fine double album ends with
“We As Love.” Benson, Foster,
Dalto and the rest of the band
showcase their talents one more
time in this beautiful instrumental
ballad and then close with a barrage
of cheers.

dramas as “The Threepenny
Opera" and “Mother Courage.” It
would have been more worthwhile
to stage one of his minor plays than
this garbled, cliche-ridden and at
times, hopelessly rhetorical
pseudo-drama. However, much of
the criticism of the script may be
due to the overall inferiority of the
production.

The two and one-half hour
presentation was often tiresome
and tedious. The major blame "must
fall on director James Prescott. In a
time of high unemployment among
artists and in an area that has a
plethora of dramatic talent, it is
curious that the Playhouse was
unable to find a more creative
director for the play.

Act one of the piece, based on
Brecht’s life, was a trial of
endurance for the small audience of

about 40. The only bright moments
were Marilyn McWilliams’ ren-
dition of the song “I Saw Him Put
On the Brown Shirt” and a lively
quartet rendering of “Johnny Went
Into the Army.” In the latter piece
choreographer David Vinski brieﬂy
captured the vital spirit of Brecht,
something that eluded most of the
presentation. Most unfortunate was
the handling of Brecht’s poetry.
Prescott seemed to have done little
more than send the actors full front

down center to make the best of it p

they could.

Act two, based on Brecht’s
theater, was much better. The
scene from “The Private Life of the
Master Race” was ably and subtley
handled by McWilliams. Brecht’s
best-known song, “Mack the
Knife” was adequate, but several of

Second Season Has Few Improvements

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News sun Writer

Television’s second season is
upon us, and many of the new shows
replacing last fall's failures are of an
even lesser quality.

Baby, Pm Back
CBS

‘ ‘Baby, I'm Back” is one of those
simplistic bits of ﬂuff that
supposedly died in the Nielsen
ratings after “All In The Family”
hit the airwaves and brought reality
to television.

The premise here is Demond
Wilsondeserted his ‘family (Denise
Nicholas, two cute kids and a hag of
a mother-in-law) several years ago.
He returns after he’s been declared
legally dead, and his wife is ready to
wed her stuffy ﬁance.

What's been happening the past
two months is Wilson trying to
seduce Nicholas, and she, primly,
resisting. Obviously, “Baby, I'm
Back” has severe limitations, the
least of which is having no plot.

To the show’s credit, Nicholas
and Wilson are good, as good as
they can be given the scripts they
are dealt. Unfortunately, that’s not
much.

Playhouse Fails

the songs of the second half were
well-done, including “Johnny”
(Sandie Reinert). Even better was
“Nothing Like Money as an
Aphrodisiac” (Richard Rauh, who
displayed the type of “alienation”
acting that Brecht admired) and,
especially, ‘ ‘Nuremburg’ ’ (‘ ‘The
drums beat wild, the mob is
murderous...”), which was stark,

Fantasy Island
ABC

Ricardo Montalban presides as
the mysterious host of an island
where people can have their wishes
come true. Of course, there's
always some clever twist—proving
that reality really works better,
anyway.

Like “The Love Boat,” which
precedes it, “Fantasy Island” is a
great vehicle for guest stars (read:
other ABC minor actors and cheap
publicity in the bargain).

Occasionally, this turns to shades
of ‘ ‘Twilight Zone’ ’ and reminds the
world that Rod Sterling did it all
much better.

James At 16
NBC

This show premiered in the
middle of last season and even
though it started out as a
made-for-television movie, it's a bit
better than the usual substitute.

Lance Kerwin plays the title role,
which is supposed to be a sort of
teenage Everyman-. Actually, Ker-
win comes across as either the kid
you used to babysit, Charlie Brown
goes to high school or half the Hardy
Boys minus a mystery. As Kerwin
goes, so goes the show.

eerie, stirring and chilling.

The technical side of the
production cannot be faulted. The
lights (Jennifer Ford) and costumes
(Mary M. Turner) were both used
effectively. The lack of creativity
had nothing to do with the attractive
and well-designed set (Boyd
Ostroff) which contained at least
ﬁve major acting areas. The
problem was that Prescott,

If the plots centered on what a
normal teenager goes through, this
would be an interesting program.
Unfortunately, someone at NBC
decided that Kerwin would need a
couple of weird sidekicks, “Father
Knows Best”-style parents and the
traditional trappings. They also
added some new techniques-
fellow students assume Kerwin is
having an affair with a favorite
teacher, and he loses his virginity at
his sweet 16 party.

The major annoyance here is the
supposedly cute addition of dream
sequences. Each episode, we not
only watch Kerwin pondering a
problem, we get to watch his
fantasies about how it should be
handled. Cute, but also trite.

If the writers would stop leaning
toward typical telivision cuteness
and add some credible situations
and believable characters, James
may make it to 17.

Quark
NBC

“Quark” is a junk collector in
outer space. Richard Benjamin, in
his ﬁrst television role since the
excellent “He and She” in the late
1960's, plays the title role.

As ‘ ‘Quark’ ’ debuted last week, it

is unfair to comment just yet. If it
doesn’t turn out to be another
attempt to cash in on “Star Wars,”
this show has a chance. For

starters, it has Benjamin. Besides, ‘
the competition of “Wonder-
Woman” and “Donny and Marie”
gives any show a good shot.

With “Brecht on Brecht”

especially in the ﬁrst half, made
poor and sparse use of four of them.

The set was wasted. A few stools
in front of the footlights were all that
were actually needed for this
production.

Several of the actors showed
talent, most notably Rauh (who was
excellent), Charles Altman, John
Amplas, Hugh Rose, Reinert and
McWilliams.

Paul Mochnick, almost a look-
alike for Brecht, who was onstage
all the time, had few lines and was
able to do little more than stand off
to the side and nod, grin, and
shufﬂe his feet.

The musicians, Pat Crosby and
Edgar Dawson, under the musical
direction of Miriam Kelly, were
ﬁne. It is interesting, however, that
they were enclosed and hidden from

the audience by a black screen.
Brecht himself always insisted that
the musicians be in full view of the

audience. *5
At the heart of Brecht’s epic

theater is the almost-forgotten art of '
storytelling. “Brecht on Brecht”
told no story, provided no insights
and attempted nothing new. It
succeeded in “alienating” the
audience in a way Brecht never
intended.

“The issue is about voting on the
board,” Hesidence said. “Alloca-
tions asked the J-board to make a
ruling whether a 4-0-3 vote should

Hesidence stated the constitution

directions for reconsidering bud-

constitution could be a possibility.

Sixteenth-Ranked Grapplers Finish Season, Buckeyes, 34-13  .

ByJIMLEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team broke a
school record for most dual-meet
wins by downing 18th-ranked Ohio
State, 34-13, in their season ﬁnale at
the Field House Saturday.

“This is the best team I’ve ever
had,” Panther coach Dave Adams
said after his squad notched its 13th
victory—one more than the old
mark set in 1974. “It may not have
been the best wrestlers I've ever
coached, but they give me every bit
of effort I ask for.”

nation, built a 17-0 lead through the

ﬁrst three weight classes and held
off a Buckeye rally that moved OSU
to within four points, 17-13.

Panther Glenn Maxwell (118
pounds) pinned 25-year-old Wayne
Holmes at 4:01 to give Pitt an early
6-0 lead. Holmes, who has wrestled
against international competition,
had been out with a concussion
since early January.

“It was his ﬁrst time in the lineup
since his injury,” Buckeye head
coach Chris Ford said. “But I can’t
take anything away from Pitt—they
have a very fine team.”

Jose Martinez won by default
over Jeff Woo, who sprained his
knee early in the third period with

ended the Panthers’ hope of
climbing past third in the Eastern
Eight standings.

Rutgers’ Scarlet Knights, led by
their “Jammin’ Junior,” 6-9 James
Bailey, took their second consecu-
tive regular-season league title .by
leaping past Pitt, 87-68, at the new
Rutgers Athletic Center.

the individual score tied 2-2, and
after all-America‘ Rande
Stottlemyer’s super superior deci-
sion over Vic Ritchey, the Panthers
had a 17-point . lead—but not
without paying for it. Martinez
suffered a shoulder injury and
Stottlemyer sprained an ankle.
“Martinez hurt his shoulder
earlier this year,” Adams said.
“He’ll get it treated and be ready
for the Eastern Wrestling League
Tournament (March 3-4).
Stottlemyer has a severe sprain,
and it could have a big effect on his
performance at the tournament.”
Things looked bad for Pitt after
that, as Panther 142-pounder Mike
Bond lost to Phil Anglim, 11-3;

150-pounder Mark Popiolkowski
was shut out by Bruce Solomon, 5-0;
158-pounder Tom Jones was
decisioned by Phil Roblee, 6-3, and
167-pounder Jim Gordon fell to Jay
Greiner, 7-4. The Buckeyes (7-11)
had pulled to within four, 17-13.

But Pitt 177-pounder George
O’Korn’s pinning of Kent
Bruggeman at 3:21 killed Ohio
State’s momentum and sent the
Panthers ahead 23-13. Bill Bailey
crushed OSU 190-pounder Jim
Anderson, 12-0, and heavyweight
Mark Stepanovich won by default
over injured Rich Packo at 5:22 to
tally the ﬁnal lopsided score.

Ford didn’t think the score was
such a landslide decision.

er Drubbing,

Stand-room tickets were sold
before this game, which featured
two teams fighting for the
number-one seed in this week’s
Eastern Eight Tournament at
Pittsburgh’s Civic Arena, but those
of the 8,700 spectators who bought
tickets late were joined by the
seated portion of the crowd often in

' the ﬁrst half.

Scarlet senior Stan Nance,
making his first start of the season
in his last game at home, scored the
game’s ﬁrst basket ﬁve seconds into
the contest on a break with the tap,
giving Rutgers its smallest lead of
the evening.

But when Pitt assistant coach
Fran Webster later said, “The first
ﬁve minutes killed us,” he wasn’t
thinking about Nance. The man who
delighted the crowd and dazed the
Panthers was Bailey.

Bailey"s 100th dunk of the season
came before the game was a minute
old. It wasn’t just a dunk—it was an

alley-oop. And it "wasn’t just an

alley-oop—it was an alley-oop over
Sam Clancy. In fact, it wasn’t just an
alley-oop over Sam Clancy—it was a
backward alley-oop over Clancy.

Pitt was in trouble.

Rutgers sprinted to leads of 9-0,
20-6 and 40-20. It took the Panthers
almost 10 minutes to pass Bailey in
scoring. The best big man Pitt has
faced this season ﬁnished the half
with 14 points and three of his six
slams. I

When not scoring at will—and, at

‘ times, when scoring at will—Bailey
was drawing fouls by Clancy, the '

6-6 strongman whom, Pitt believed,
would counter Rutgers fearsome
frontline of Bailey, Abdel Anderson
and Hollis Copeland. But, after his
third foul, Clancy spent 13 and a
half minutes watching from the
bench what he had watched for six
and a half minutes from in the
lane——a scoring raid by a Scarlet
frontline that was responsible for 40
of Rutgers’ 44 ﬁrst-half points.
Kelvin Troy, a 6-4 freshman,
contributed 11 points as a
substitute.

Clancy, known to collect three
rebounds in one play, had but one
at halftime. Without him, the
Panthers were left to watch,
stunned, as Rutgers outraced

them along the ﬂoor and outleaped
them around the rim.

“It (the alley-oop) isn’t some-
thing we work on,” said Bailey, who
turned that pretty play into points at
least ﬁve times. “It’s just a matter
of timing—we have six guys who
can do it.”

By “it,” Bailey meant the high,
lazy pass that begins the alley-oop.
It is up to Bailey, however, to stuff it

through the hoop, even when the ‘

ball is caught above the basket—a
goaltending violation no ofﬁcial in
the country calls.

Pitt’s players became busy at

watching the Knights run back and _ A

forth and jump again and again, so,
by the half, Pitt coach -Tim Grgurich
has used 10 players. Only Ed
Scheuermann played the entire 20
minutes. ‘

The halftime score was 44-24;
Bailey and Troy had 25 collective
points at that time.

Pitt outscored the Scarlet 44-43,
in the second half, although the
Panther offense never completely
unwrapped the box-and-one de-
fense Rutgers used to package
Larry Harris. '

“Harris had 24,” Rutgers coach
Tom Young said, “but the box did
what we wanted it to do. It shut
them down.”

Harris’s 24 was followed by Terry
Knight’s 12 -for Pitt, which was
uncertain on offense all night. Even
Scott Nedrow and Bob Haygood, the
normally quick-wristed guards

Grgurich used in tandem several .

times, were hesitant with the shot.

Scheuermann and Knight each
had six rebounds to lead the
Panthers, who often during the
game were no closer to the boards
than they had been at the Holiday
Inn, a healthy ﬁve-minute drive
away. Troy had 13 boards for
Rutgers, Bailey, 11 and Copeland,
eight.

It was the worst performance of
the season for Pitt, a team erratic to
extreme.

“That’s why you worry about
playing a (club like that,” said
Rutgers’ Young. “You never know
how well they are going to
play...when they are going to be
ready. So you worry about them.”

“When you come right down to it,
Pitt won the most matches, 6-4,” he
said. “But those two defaults and
pins were the difference. I thought
we’d win at 126—Woo was doing
real well, But those defaults and
pins did it. Our kids aren’t pinners
yet—we have a lot of freshmen and
sophomores.”

“It amounted to a very close
match,” Adams agreed. “Ohio
State is very tough competition.
This could have an effect on the way
we perform at the EWL
Tournament. If we’d have lost, it
would have put a sting into our
team, but this win and the big win
over West Virginia (42-3) gives us
momentum.”

If Young is worried about Pitt—a
team he could again meet only in the
tournament ﬁna1s—he has com-

Pantherettes Crumble Under Rutgers ’ Blitz, 88-6 7

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL
Pitt News Slaffwriter
PISCATAWAY, N.J.—The ﬁnal
score of the Pitt-Rutgers women s
basketball game here Saturday

evening was 88-67, but the numbers j

that gave the Pantherettes their
11th loss were 26-1.

A second-half blitz by the Scarlet,
fueled mainly by a nine-minute
scoring sprint, in which Rutgers
was the only team to score from the
ﬁeld, carried them to the 21-point
win. ,

The game was a prelimenary to a

men’s game between the same

schools at Rutgers Athletic Center.

Pitt led at the half, 45-42, and
held a lead of one point, 49-48, with
little more than 16 minutes
remaining in the game. That’s
when the Pantherettes went to
sleep.

Pitt’s nine-minute nightmare
began when a basket by 5-10 Scarlet
foward Kathy Sikorski gave Rutgers
a 50-49 lead at 16:08. It was
interrupted brieﬂy when Pitt center
Wanda Randolph made .1 free throw
at 10:01 but ended only when
‘Randolph made -an eight-foot

turnaroundjumper three and a half
minutes later.

That belated basket made it
74-52, ending a 26-1 Rutgers streak.

Sikorski had eight points during
those nine minutes; Pitt, it is safe to
say, had fewer than eight shots at
the hoop in the same period.

In fact, had the Pantherettes not
called three timeouts and commit-
ted a ﬂurry of fouls, one could have
taken the impression Pitt had spent
nine minutes watching a Scarlet

practice that ‘concentrated. on the.-

fast break. The Rutgers spree
demoralized the Pantherettes,
whose attitude was as poor as their
play while the Rutgers lead
advanced through the teens.

Randolph led Pitt with 22 points
before fouling out; Kit Loefﬂer had
12 and Debbie Lewis added 10.
Loefﬂer also had nine rebounds,
Randolph had eight and Mimi
Senkowski had seven.

Pitt shot 39 percent from the field
but improved to 41 percent from the
f9.u.,l .li.n.e.. - .. .

-.....&...._.--- . . . . . --

Rutgers, playing without a
player as tall as 6-0 because of an
injury to 6-2 center Sandy Tupurins,
outrebounded Pitt, 56-42.

Pitt, 13-11, ends its season at
Immaculata tonight.

PANTHERETTE NOTES: Forward
Kathy Clutz had _20 rebounds for
Rutgers...six of the Scarlets scored
in double ﬁgures...Rutgers‘ se-
‘cond-half margin was 46-22...the
Scarlets are undefeated (4-0) at the
Ath_letic Center.

Monday, February 27, 19‘78—THE PITT NEWS—Page 13

By CHRISTOPHER C. HOEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

‘AMHERST, M.ass.—Larry Harris’s noteworthy career at
Pitt, one which Wlll see its last regular-season game tonight,
has been punctuated more than have most; there have been
question marks and exclamation points—mainly, there have

been points.
Harris was Ohio’s high school player of the year ﬁve years
ago, and when he came to Pitt, he left behind a lengthy trail

(of coaches’ broken hopes. One claimed in a national sports

magazine that the 6-6 sharpshooter had promised to attend
his school (and shoot basketballs at his hoop), but Harris
was at Pitt to stay.

As a freshman, he played for a team that appeared in a
pair of post-season tournaments and won 18 games before
falling to Providence in the second round of the NIT.

Harris, from his arrival, was his team's most gifted
athlete. He was tall, agile, strong and seemed to be
equipped with telescopic sights. Complaints centered
largely around his desire to use those talents. At times, the
complaints came from the coach. He was benched several
times.

With 20 points against Massachusetts, however, he’ll
have averaged 20 points per game during each of three
consecutive regular season.

He has played before ﬁve-ﬁgure crowds; tonight, he’ll
end his last regular season here, playing at a gym called
Curry Hicks Cage, in an area whose phone book weighs less
than a good Playboy.

It will be in this game that Larry Harris takes away Don
Hennon’s place atop Pitt’s career scoring list; it is to be
hoped the noted points will come on a 20-foot jumper that
nicks nothing but net, as that is the shot with which Harris
has led for three years, and it is the shot that ensures Harris
a place in the pros.

“I’ve enjoyed it all,” says Harris. “The good and the
bad...I’m happy it all happened.”

So, it can be assumed, are Pitt’s fans.

Although only tonight’s Pitt-Massachusetts meeting
remains on the Eastern Eight schedule, and although that
game will affect only two teams’ standings in the league,
many uncertainties concerning this week’s league
tournament remain.

The tournament will begin Thursday with four games at

-the Civic Arena. Only four teams will emerge to play Friday

night; the trick for those league officials who do not wish to
lose large amounts of league money will involve insuring
that at least one Pittsburgh team survives the opening round
and advances as far as possible.

Last year’s divisional setup is gone; tournament seedings
are to be based ons tandings derived from each teams
10-game Eastern Eight schedule.

Rutgers (7-3 league record, 21-5 overall) clinched the top
seed by blasting Pitt Saturday night. Villanova was 7-3 in
the league, but overall records was the second-ranking
factor, and the Wildcats’ 18-8 fell short to the Knights’
record.

Rutgers, therefore, will play league loss-leader West
Virginia (3-7) Thursday; Villanova will settle for Penn state
(4-6). Each should win, placing a pair of quality teams in the
semiﬁnals.

Pitt (6-3) will determine its ﬁrst-round opponent tonight;
if the Panthers beat Massachusetts (4-5), they will play the
minutemen again Thursday. If the Minutemen should win
tonight, the Panthers would open with_ George Washington.

Duquesne will play whichever team Pitt does not.

League officials already have shown sagacity by planning
to have Pitt and Duquesne each play Thursday making a
good crowd a relatively sure bet.

Some consideration has been given to putting the
Panthers and Dukes in the same bracket, increasing the
chances of Pitt-Duquesne meeting, and also the probability
of having a Pittsburgh team in the Saturday night ﬁnals.

 Reflections On a Great Career and an Upcoming Tourney  

That, however, would put Villanova and Rugers, the
co-champions, in the same bracket. Villanova athletic
director Ted Aceto is on the three-tournament committee,
and although Cas Myslinski and Duquesne’s Red Manning
held a 2-1 voting advantage, it is likely Aceto’s wish to stay
from Rutgers until Saturday will be granted.

Thus, it is likely Pitt would meet the Villanova-Penn State
winner in Friday evening's semiﬁnals. The Rutgers-WVU
winner would take on the surviver of Duquesne’s ﬁrst game.

The ﬁnal, then, probably would pair Rutgers and the
Pitt-Villanova winner. Rutgers’ 21-win season would seem
to signal trouble for either the Panthers or Wildcats, each of
whom has fallen to the Knights this season.

But Pitt guard Scott Nedrow holds hope for the Panthers,
should another Pitt-Rutgers match occur.

‘ ‘It’s tough to beat a team twice like that —in the regular
season and then right away in the tournament,” Nedrow
said. “That ﬁrst game shows something to each team, but
different things.”

It was pointed out to Nedrow, a senior, that Pitt would
have to defeat Massachusetts twice in a space of four days.

‘ ‘I was thinking abou that, too.” Said Nedrow, without so
much excitement.

Pitt, before the Rutgers loss, also was thinking about a bid
to the NIT, which was slimmed from 16 to 8 teams in the
off-season.

Last year’s NIT had three Eastern Eight teams—Rutgers,
Villanova and Massachusetts. Only Rutgers, and perhaps
Villanova, would seem to have a chance this year.

The Panthers would do well to conﬁne their thoughts to
the Eastern Eight tournament. They will be playing not only
for their school, but also for the league. Since Duquesne
can’t seem to draw at the Arena—a recent crowd of 1,700 at
a game with Massachusetts leads one to wonder whether the
Dukes could draw a crowd of nymphomaniacs if they played
without their shorts—the Eastern Eight’s immediate
ﬁnancial future rests largely on the Panthers’ shoulders.

Record-Breaking Wrestling Season Was Written on the Wall

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Was the Pitt wrestling team
aware that they were within reach of
a school-record 13 wins before its
34-13 drubbing of 18th-ranked Ohio
state Saturday?
“Just look at the blackboard in

. ‘he locker room,” Panther head

coach Dave Adams said, nodding
toward a small, stuffy room.

On the board, in capital letters,
was an inspirational message:

“A win over OSU will mean that
we have achieved the most wins
ever a Pitt wresting team has had in
a season. Lucky 13.”

The message worked. The
chance to get into the record books,
coupled with the last match for
seniors 134-pounder all-American
Rande STottlemyer, 177-pounder
George O’Kom, 190-pounder Bill
Bailey and heavyweight Mark
Stepanovich,'provided enough of an
emotional catalyst for Pitt to wallop
. Buckeye team that is much better

7  the ﬁnal score indicated.

But the win, the entire season,
wasn’t exactly lucky for Pitt’s
co-captains. Bailey suffered a rib
injury at Penn State Feb. 18 that will
bother him in the Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL) Tournament at
Bloomsburg March 3-4, and
Stottlemyer suffered a severely
sprained ankle in Saturday’s victory
that could prevent him from
qualifying for the NCAA Champion-
ships.

~-, ‘‘I still can’t walk on it,”

', ;\”5'tottlemyer said. “I can’t put any
“weight on it.

But it’s my last
year—I’ve got to pull out all stops.

If there’s any possible way I can
wrestle, I will.”

“He’s wrestled in pain before,”
Adams said. ‘ ‘If he can get through
the EWL Tournament okay, he
should be ready for the NCAA’s.”

Bailey’s injury isn’t as serious,
but it is still bothersome.

“I have to slow down a little,”
Bailey explained, ‘ ‘because I hurt it
in practice sometimes. It could
bother me at the tournament, but
then_again it may be okay.”

Whatever injuries any of the four
seniors acquired over the season-
all four (Stottlemyer, O’Kom,
Bailey and Stepanovich) have been
out at one time or another with some
ache——weren,’t felt against OSU. It
was the ﬁnal match of each
wrestlers’ career; they had to
participate in it.

“It was the last time they put on a
uniform at home—,-they were
psyched,” Adams said. “There
was a lot of emotion. The entire
team dedicated the match,to the
seniors’ parents.”

And because of the dedication,
Pitt held a pre-match ceremony
where the respective families were
introduced and the ~ ladies were
pinned with camations. Penn State
held a similar ceremony before its
match with the Panthers, and the
emotion carried them to a lopsided
28-1 victory.

“There was a lot of emotion
having the family come out and be
introduced,” Bailey agreed. “You
realize that four years have come to
an end and having the team
together creates even more emo-

Bradshaw Faces Pleasant Dilemma

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Stafl'Writer
_Pitt swim coach Dick Bradshaw
has a dilemma, but it’s one he
doesn’t mind having.

Heading into this week’s Eastern
Regional Championships at Trees
Pool, Bradshaw has to decide who
will swim in the three freestyle relay
events-—-200, 400 and 800 yards.

“It’s a problem,’ ’ Bradshaw said,
“but it’s one I like. We just have so
many good guys that we have to
make some decision as to where
they’re. going: -to.-be -s.w.im.min.g~_;

Whatever happens, someone’s
going to be left out.”

Keeping in mind that only four
swimmers can compete in any one
event, Bradshaw has to choose
among six swimmers in the 200
(Dave Civis, Bob Greenwald, Dale
Pﬂaumer, Jeff Trew, Neal Wallace
and Tom McGinley); seven in the
400 (Mark Schuman, Greenwald,
Civis, Mickey Termin, McGinley,
Stu Swanson and Neal Wallace) and
seven in the -800 (Greenwald,
Termin, Trew, Schuman, Civis,
Pﬂaumer and Swanson).

v.‘-f1.W.is.h.1 c9u1d_¢me.r two relax:

teams in each event,” Bradshaw
said, “but you can’t do that in the
Easterns.”

Bradshaw, who led the Panthers
to their ﬁrst undefeated dual meet
season in 30 years, said past
performances will ﬁgure into his
decision.

“It’s exciting and challenging to
these guys,” Bradshaw said.
"Anv one of them can swim. It's
good we have this kind of
competition, and it will keep them
on their toes for the Nationals where
the pressure’s going to be even
greater.”

re \e.

If Pitt can convince one of its away opponents on
the merits of playing football abroad, the Pitt foot-
ball team could be brushing up on things other than
end sweeps and pass rushes when spring practice
opens in April—things like eating with chopsticks
and speaking Japanese.

According to Pitt athletic director Cas Myslinski,
‘representatives from the Japan-based Video Pro-
motion, Tele Planning International, buoyed by
the success of the American college football games it
has sponsored in the past in Japan for a Dec. 3 date
in the Miriage Bowl at Tokyo.

Myslinski, “satisfied” with the “fairly good”
monetary guarantee Pitt would be assured if it agrees
to play in Japan, said Pitt would be “more than
willing” to play there——if it can find an opponent
who's just as keen on the idea.

The only way the Panthers could consider the
move would be to switch one of their away games.
Penn State and Notre Dame, who has been offered a
similar deal by the Japanese to move one of its 1979
games, are definitely out. Financially, it would be
ridiculous for either of these two teams to move its
games with Pitt to foreign soil.

But Boston College, Syracuse and Tulane, three
of Pitt’s away opponents who might benefit most by
the move because of their low attendance records and
small stadium seating capacities, are possibilities.

Myslinski said the possibility of moving out one
of Pitt’s home games to Japan is out of the question.
Pitt likes to play five games at home. It doesn’t want
to play one less.

Boston College, Tulane and Syracuse, otherwise
sold on the idea of playing abroad, won’t move their

point to Pitt playing at Boston College, Tulane and
Syracuse at their respective stadiums instead of
Tokyo Stadium—a fact further substantiated by a
report in last week’s Sporting News that said

‘Brigham Young and Nevada—Las Vegas (two of the

dozen or so teams the Japanese have been talking
with) have agreed to move their game to Japan.

 

But Myslinski, noting that the Video Promotion,
Tele Planning International has continued to keep in
touch with him since last month’s visit, maintains
there is still a small chance Pitt with play in Japan
next December.

“I’m not saying’ that our chances of playing in
Japan are good,” Myslinski said. “Technically,

» we’re about 100 percent sure of not going over there.

But we haven’t given up yet. I would say there’s still a
one—half percent chance of our still going. That is, if
one of our away opponents would happen to change
its mind and decide to play there. ”

In addition to the financial guarantee Pitt would
be assured, the deal also includes round-trip air tran-
sportation from New York to Tokyo for 80 to 88
team members and 80 to 100 band members.

Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill said he was
“thrilled about the idea of playing in Japan.”

“What college student wouldn’t want to go to
Japan for a few days,” Sherrill said. ‘‘I think this
would be a great educational experience for our
students.”

But that's where the problems could arise. It
would be a nice educational package for the players
and band members, but what about the students who
couldn’t afford the $1,000 plus airfare it would take
to make the trip?

And what about those fans at Syracuse, Boston
College and Tulane? If any one of those teams
decides at the last minute to play Pitt in Japan, the
fans who regularly attend these teams’ games would
be deprived of seeing their team at home. It could
mean a further cut in attendance if those fans become
alienated by such a move—and there promises to be a
few—and refuse to turn out for any more of their
teams’ home games.

The players, band members and small group of
fans that would go would be treated warmly by the
sports-crazed Japanese fans. American college foot-
ballvplayers who have participated in the Japan Bowl
have said the Japanese more than go out of their way
to make them feel at home.

Grambling and Temple, the two teams that par-
ticipated. in last year’s Miriage Bowl, have said
similar things. Those two teams are interested in
returning to Japan this year.

Until it’s announced otherwise, Pitt has a small
chance of spending a few days in Japan in early
December.

It’s up to several of the Panthers’ opponents to see
if they want to do the same.

Although.Osborne’s role as the
Panthers’ head trainer ultimately
takes second billing to the players
themselves, his assists often times
are as helpful as a rink-wide,
game-winning pass off the stick of
Curt Hetz.

“Bob holds this team together
sometimes,” assistant coach Bob
Montgomery said. “If it weren’t for
him in Miami (Ohio), we would’ve

of the team had a lot of minor

But Osborne made his rounds at
the teams’ motel that night, and,

the Panthers were ready for round

at the Civic Arena against the

year—another loss (5-4) for Pitt.

(“It was my ﬁrst game as head
hockey trainer,” Osborne said. “I
was taking care of Curt (Hetz) in the
dressing room with a concussion
when someone came running in,
yelling that Bob Stein had just hurt
his ankle. The first thing I thought
was ‘oh, great!’

“That was my baptism of fire, I
guess—my ﬁrst game. We started"
running out of players. That and the
Miami trip are the toughest things
I’ve encountered.”

Osborne, a sophomore pre-
physical therapy major who worked
in high school (North Catholic) as a
football, basketball and hockey

considering his past (and possible
future) experiences at the Steelers’
football training camp, Osborne
admits to “liking hockey the best.”

“During Pitt football season,”. 

there is a head trainer, an assistant
head trainer and seven students on
the staff, and I carry out
responsibilities assigned to me. But
with hockey, I run the show. The
whole team is my responsibility,
and I do what I want to do.”

For the Pitt hockey club, they
could like nothing else.

“The players love him,”
Montgomery said. “They guard
him with their lives.”

‘ ‘They’re a great bunch of guys,’ ’
Osborne said with mutual respect,
“and I like what I’m doing. I feel
appreciated.”

Ah-So--Panthers May Take Football Show to Japan 

Panther Distance Medley Captures First at USTAF F Meet 

ByMARIASCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Once upon a time, Pitt held the
world record for the distance
medley relay. That was seven years
ago, and the time was 9:39.7. Well,
1971 this isn’t, and a world record it
wasn’t, but last weekend the
Panthers put together a distance
medley team that came away from
an Ohio United States Track and
Field Federation (USTAFF) meet
with ﬁrst place in the event.

Gary Siriano (1:56 half mile), Bud

Cooper (49.5 quarter mile), Tom
Herrmann (2:58 three-quarter mile)
and Mel Boyd (4:13 mile) built up a
comfortable lead and were afforded
the luxury of coasting in with a time
of 10:06.

The cold atmosphere (the tem-
perature of the Ohio State
fieldhouse hovered somewhere
around the 50-degree mark) affect-
ed jumping as well as running,
pointed out Dan Goodyear, the
meet’s second-place winner in the
high jump.

“There was just no way anyone
could warm up properly,” he said.
“On my ﬁrst jump at six feet eight
inches, 1 strained a muscle in my
lower back because it was so turkin’
cold. Icou1dn’t get totally stretched
out during warmup time.”

The senior went on to clear 6 feet,
10 inches. This height was the same
as that attained by the ﬁrst- and
third-place winners, but final
standings were determined by the
number of misses each jumper
collected.

Another senior, Keith Taylor,
triple jumped his way to fourth-
place with a leap of 46 feet, 10
inches. He has consistently placed
in this event at meets throughout
his collegiate career.

Fifth-place honors were won by
the two-mile relay team of Siriano,
Jack Cade, Roger Winstanley and
Richie Moore, whose time of 7250.6
was one of their fastest this year.

Overall, the Panther athletes
were not impressed with the

USTAFF meet. Many complained of
the uncomfortable temperature,
while Cooper concluded that “the
combination of cold, unorganization

(the meet ran about an hour and a
half behind schedule) and lack of
any real quality competition didn’t

make for one of our better meets, in
my estimation.”

Anyone who shivered through
last Saturday afternoon can’t argue’

with that. , ‘

Pitt’s Bucci Has A Dream: To Play Professional Soccer

By ANNA ARLOTTA

“To be a professional in your
ﬁeld is the desire of every young
athlete,” said Frank Bucci Pitt’s
soccer goalie. “To me, it would be
a dream come true._”

This dream of Bucci’s began six
years ago when he began playing
high school soccer in Bethel Park.
Because of his small stature,
Bucci’s exceptional quickness has
gained him the starting position
since hispfreshman year.

Throughout his four years at Pitt,
Bucci has received a number of
honors. Every season he has been
named to the Western Pennsyl-

vania Conference all-star team. and
three of those years he was a
member of the all-East team. As a
junior Bucci broke Pitt’s record of
career shutouts with 10, and added
five more his senior year, just one
shutout off the single-season mark.

“One of the most exciting honors.

I’ve ever been given was being able-

to compete against the 1980
Olympic team last summer, while a
member of the Pittsburgh all-
stars,” Bucci said.

With these accomplishments,
Bucci believes he has fulﬁlled most
of his goals concerning soccer.

‘‘I wouldn’t exchange my four

years at Pitt for anything,” he said.
“I’ve enjoyed playing here with
teammates who were great players
and friends.”

Bucci also credits coach Leo
Bemis for some of his success. “He
has taught me a great deal about
soccer and how to be able to deal
with people. I wanted to go out a
winner and I feel that last years
7-7-1 record was a satisfactory way
to leave.”

Soccer enthusiasm among the
players has picked up in the past
few years, with Bucci emerging as
an‘ on-the-ﬁeld team leader. He
captained the 1977 team, and was

joined halfway through the season
by Karl and Mark Nigh as
tri-captains.

“Team morale picked up a great
deal,” said Bucci. “The team has
become more uniﬁed, especially
after last season; we really stuck
together.”

This unity is what Bucci believes
will make the 1978 Panthers a
winner.

“The team is very young, and I
believe next year will be Pitt’s year
for soccer.”

There is a good chance that
Bucci’s dream of playing pro soccer
will come true. He has trials

scheduled with the Cleveland and
New Jersey teams of the American
Soccer League. If outdoor soccer is
not in his future. Bucci believes he
will be drafted by a National Indoor
soccer team. '

“With indoor I can get more
experience and I hope he noticed
by an outdoor pro team,” Bucci
said.

NOW playing on Pitt’s 

team. Bucci had a ﬁne outing in
last weekend’s tournament at Penn
5tate(_B€3\f€I‘)- The Panthers re-
corded wins over ﬁve different

OPPOHCIRS, as Bucci allowed only
one goal.

Our Writers

Scattered, not unlike chaff, throughout this
issue are the very first contributions from
those dear readers who now Break Into the
Big Time.

CHRIS CLARK (On Disc), University of
Colorado, wants us to believe he bears. an
uncanny resemblance to Peter Frampton and
likes blonde nymphomaniacs.

NAOMI LINDSTROM (In Print), also from
the University of Texas at Austin, is in-
terested in “works studying popular culture,
the attempt to make some soggy con-
ventional bog of popular culture ino a viable

form of expression.”

DIANE MICHELFELDER (In Print), yet an-
other from the University of Texas at Austin
(we don’thowa why there are so many hopeﬁil
writers there) is most interested in “writing
that deals with America — is sweat, drizzle
and sweet anxiety.”

J. C. NORTON (On Tour), is a psychologist
at the University of Kentucky Medical Cen-
terwhich, sofar, hasn’tirnpairedhissenseof
humor or critical acumen.

MICHAEL WARD, from Long Beach,
California (the comic strip Boid) tells [LS he’s
24, a college graduate, a produced play-
wright, and “I’ve been funny for years.”

Ampersand is not a bad rag, well written," in-
formative, and successful in covering the
Rocrol and stardust movie scene. So what?
There are an easy half-‘dozen plastic sheets
on every newsstand doing the same thing;
what makes Ampersand special? The only
reason I could see for bothering to read your
copy was the lack of a price tag. Considering
the structure of your masthead, and the high
priced talent your ads display, you’ve got
nerve asking you readers to pay your soda
bill- Five dollars for subscription, indeed!
Maybe you should go for the house-
wives/supermarket scene. Maybe I’m just
upset over your running down the

’Stones. . . .
GORDON McCoI.LIsTER
UNIVERSITY or HAWAII

The kind of sacrilege your Lynne Manor
perpetrated on the Rolling Stones and rock
music in general cannot be taken without
comment. To lump the Stones with such
unmitigated trash as Golden Earring and
Foghat is bad enough, but to have the gall to
refer to them as a “get-up-and-boogie band”
is taking journalistic license over the edge.
(By the way, Manor ought to have hers rc-
voked.)

True, the sound recording of the album is
subpar, but to take that as an excuse to rap
the Stones as musicians and songwriters is a
low blow. “Decent technicians” have
screwed,.up the sound quality of many an
album. See ’em live, Manor. And next time,
save your smoking and drinking for con-
certs, not review 

Once past that trash, the rest of Ampersand
is excellent reading. Keep up the good work.
Save Manor to review the next Kiss record.
Right up her alley.

DEAN AHEARN
UNIvERsITY or MARYLAND

In your “On disc” article of the November
supplement, a part concerning the Rolling
Stones leads me to believe that your writer
either suffers from loss of memory or lack of
experience in such matters.-

Having been a professional musician for
over 17 years I’ve seen the vast and rather
swift eviloution of Rock music steming from
the likes of Pat Boone and Rick Nelson on
up to the so called, hard Rock groups today
who’s on stage show and appearence far ex-
ceed their musical talents. I have excluded
Elvis due to the fact that he reigned over his
own musical world, uncomparable to any
other type music.

My feelings toward the Rolling Stones run
along those same lines. Their contributions

. to the world of Rock music are also uncom-

parable. And the only thing ﬂabby about
them is probably their bank books. Even the
picture in the article contradicts the state-
ment concerning the amount of “Get up”
left amoung the members of the group. After
all the blood, sweat and tears emitted
throughout their career it’s a wonder Jagger
is still able to get that high off the ground.
The Lord only knows how.

_ Rock or Blues or Ballad, The Stones also
reign over their own musical world, not to
be judged by anyone. I look forward to every

IN on

release and concert from them, and I’m sure

I’m not alone.
MICHAEL SHIFLET,
INDIANA UNIVERSITY STAFF

Our reviewer, Lynne Manor, says that she’ll make
a deal with you: you don’t tgv to spell, and she
won’! tgv to play a guitar. More seriously, she says
that ‘she’: been a fan (J the Rolling Stones long

, enough to wish they’d quit while they were ahead, so

that we could all revel in the memogr. Is that really
all that jogger, Richard and compary want to do
for the rest Qf their lives? If thq’re still so good,
why don’t thy expand their horizons a bit and try
something new? Same goes for Led Zep.

Ask Us

The first issue I saw of Ampersand had letters
in it commenting on an article you ran about
Kiss —- too bad I never saw that issue —-— I’d
have loved it because I hate Kiss.

There is one “Kiss” I do like._ That’s
“French kiss”, by Bob Welch (formerly of
Fleetwood Mac and Paris). This guy is my
hero — you will probably laugh but I really
think he is the greatest guitarist ever. I’ve
got every “F-M” album he played on and
both Paris albums. I was awaiting the third
Paris album when I saw his solo album.

I know this might be impossible, but I
would really like to know what happened to
Paris, and for that matter, why Fleetwood
Mac and he went different ways. You said
you’d answer some letters and I hope this

will be one of them. . _
JEFF Cl-IAMBERLIN

UNIVERSITY or ILLINoIs

Ask Mr. Music: Glenn Cornick is living in Los
Angeles, and putting together a band. Hunt Sales
has been on the road with various acts, notably
David Bowie.

Bob was a member of the group when thy were
embroiled in legal battles with the fellow who was
trying to sell an ersatz Fleetwood Mac to an un-
wary public. Tired If the litigation, and wanting to
make his own music, Bob left. He’s still pals with
the band, though, and is currently managed by
Mick Fleetwood. I

This past summer I was introduced to the
music of Richard Torrance and just this
month I had the pleasure of meeting this
great artist in Lincoln, Nebraska. His music
has a beautiful style and his personality and
character match it.

Would you please print up a little intro-
ductory information on Richard Torrance
soon.

I know he has four albums now, with a
new one to be released in January. There are
3 of the albums now in the U.S. but the 4th
is only released in Europe.

Can you tell me where I can find Belle Qf
the Ball? I’ve searched high and low!

Richard Torrance, in his mid-20s, is based in Los
Angeles. He was born in Fargo, North Dakota and
raised mostly in Santa Barbara, California. He’s
never been in my bands that anyone has heard (J
and was signed to Shelter through independent pro-
ducer Duane Scott. Richard’: last album was on
Capitol, as will be his next, due in March. The
new album, which is just being finished, features
Richard with the band he used in Lincoln; it’s
being produced by john Haeny. Although he’s not
world-famous, Richard sells well and is respected

Stop Complaining

Iassume _]acoba Atlas is the j.A.'of the
movies review of Valentino.If jacoba is a
woman she should think about her state-

ment that Valentino was “every woman’si

rape fantasy in the l920’s.” If Jacoba is a
man — he should totally withdraw the state-
ment. Women may have “lovemaking” fan-
tasies -— no one wants to be raped — it’s not
pleasurable and such remarks only per-

petuate a myth — otherwise nice paper.
TONI EBEL
HOUSTON, TExAs

jacoba (Woman) Atlas stands by her statement.
“Valentino was marketed as a rape fantag; just
look at The Sheik: a woman is raped, but there is
no pain, and they fall in love later. That’s a rape
fantag. No one wants to be raped, but may
women have rape fantasies. There’s an important
dtﬂ"erence.”

The -Bob Dylan Report

OL’ B03 WILL BE BUSY this year; this month
he auditioned musicians for a band which
he’ll take on tour to Tokyo in February, Au-
stralia in March, a U.S. recording studio in
April, and a U.S. or Western European tour
(Bob-is undecided) after that. Meanwhile,
his first ﬁlm, which he wrote, produced, di-
rected, stars in and distributes, Renaldo and
Clara, opens right about now in New York,
Minneapolis and Los Angeles.

Overdoing It

COLUMBIA PICTURES bought screen rights
_to the hit musical Annie, but won’t turn it
into a ﬂick until 1981, by which time star
Andrea McCardle will be too old, but that’s
only slightly tragic. What’s really tragic:
Columbia paid $9.4 million for the rights,
the most ever paid for any property
(runner-up: $5 million for Chorus Line).
That’s just for'the use of the name, words,
and music, folks; that doesn’t include
salaries, sets, costumes and other inciden-
tals. And for a one-song musical, at that.

LARRY FLYNT, Tl-[E OL’ HUSTLER, has pur-
chased the Los Angeles Free Press, which he
intends to turn into a national weekly cross
between the Village Voice and National
Enquirer. First edition, which should be on
the stands any minute, will be a special
Kennedy assassination issue. Then there’ll
be a few weeks regrouping time, and then
the national version on a regular basis. Flynt

has been pouring considerable money into .

the faded rag, and hopes to overcome the
range of emotions, from apathy to down-
right hostility, that have greeted t_he Free
Press’s most recent incarnation as a low-
circulation sex tabloid with a" bit of third-

~ rate reporting thrown in. Can’t say that

Larry doesn’t have a sense of humor: he also
just bought a weekly in Plains, GA.

She was hauled away before anything seri-

that he wasn’t chosen for the lead in Lenryi or

and Martin Mull, Azoff has included a con-
cert sequence by his client, jimmy Buffett; a
title number by his client, Steely Dan; and
more live footage, by Linda Ronstadt, who
is — amazing! — not an Irving Azoﬂ' client.
There are, apparently, no Eagles and no

QUOTE-OF-THE-MONTH (movie division):
“Even your most intelligent people go to the
movies to escape, not to ingest information
that they have to put together in their heads.
I know that’s true of me. If I were an audi-
ence and not part of the craft, I probably
would never see Bergman movies or Zef-
firelli, or Fellini or Costa-Gavras. I’d prob-
ably just see Irwin Allen disaster movies and

QUOTE-OF-THE-MONTH (music division):
“Hot Tuna would play for four hours and

Reading Black Orchid, a new romantic ad-
venture novel written by, according to the
book’s dust jacket, “Nicholas Meyer author
of The Seven-Per-Cent Solution and Barry Jay
Kaplan” (Dial Press, $8.95), one can_ almost

smell the popcorn. What at movie this one '

will make! I

What reader, caught up (however in-
voluntarily) in this rich, lush saga of love
and danger in the jungles of the Amazon,
will not long to'actually see and hear the
orange-haired dancer Athéné “gasping and
panting like a racehorse” in the arms of
travel-worn soldier-of-fortune Harry Kin-
caid —- or the same Kincaid’s coupling with
the calculating Mercedes .\Coutard in the
mud of the Rio Negro? What heart will not
thrill to the spectacle of an opening night at

the opera, full of secretive ﬂirtation and in-

trigue —-— but on the very edge of the mys-
terious, foreboding rain forest? What pulse
will not quicken as Kincaid and company
kidnap the plantation owner’s beautiful
daughter, Dolores Mendonca, even as a

 

fint

Black Orchid is a successful, undemanding
entertainment, almost worth reading for the
comparative novelty of its setting alone. It is
not so carefully written as Meyer’s Holmes
books were: Meyer’s Dr. Watson would
never have permitted himself the inelegance,
for instance, of speaking of “three ships that
had to be gutted and the holds rebuilt to
accommodate the girders.” And some of the
language borders on pure pulp: “ ‘Don’t go,’
she begged, knowing no shame now, only
her own desperate desire,” or “ ‘We have
several advantages,’ the Colonel said . . .
‘We know the river; he does not.’ ” But the
book is mostly easy fun — and is easily as
full of decorative detail as, if no more endur-
ing than, the city of Manaus was herself.

Women See Men (McGraw-Hill, $12.95
hardcover; $7.95 softcover), edited by
Yvonne Kalmus, Rikki Ripp, and Cheryl
Wiesenfeld as a successor to their previous
book, Women See Women, may or may not say
something about men, or about women, or
about the spaces (or lack of spaces) between
the two halves of thehuman species - but it
certainly doesn’t say very much about pho-
tography.

With a handful of exceptions (Eileen K.
Berger’s ritualistic “Two boys ﬁghting in
landscape”; Karen Tweedy-Holmes’ comic
nude, “Franks”; Inge Morath’s classic
masked portrait of Saul Steinberg; etc.), the
images presented here are mostly pretty

splendorous costume ball in her honor spins
on and on? And — let’s face it -— which of us
will not watch with fascinated horror ‘as
piranhas nip at K1'ncaid’s legs (for all is not
orange-haired dancers and plantation own-
ers’ daughters for travel—worn soldiers-of-
fortune), or as the adventurer’s assistant is
eaten to the bone by killer ants?

Ironically, Black Orchid started out as a
movie — or, anyway, as a movie script.
Meyer, whose witty and well-crafted Sher-
lock Holmes parodies — The Seven-Per-Cent
Solution and The West End Horror —— estab-
lished him as one of the best and most clever
of our popular novelists, grew fascinated
with the true story of the city of Manaus. A
kind of boom town built around the rubber
trade, Manaus, deep in the Amazon wilder-
ness, was, in the late 19th century, the
sixth-richest city in the world — with a
sophisticated system of public transporta-
tion, complete electrical power throughout,
and an opera house said to have been more
magnificent than La Scala. Based loosely on
historical fact, Meyer wrote, as a screenplay,
a story about a man sent to Manaus by the
British to steal rubber seedlings for replant-
ing in Southeast Asia — in order to break
the Brazilian monopoly on the product.
Meyer’s script was bought but never pro-
duced; he liked the story well enough to buy
it back from the studio and to work on turn-
ing it into a book, with the help of Barry jay
Kaplan, a college friend of his, who had
written “a dozen romances and gothics
under various pen names.” It will be
Meyer’s sweet revenge on whatever lag-
gardly studio bosses they were, presumably,
if Black Orchid is bought again for film prod-
uction —-— as it almost certainly will be, and
at a good price to boot.

dreary ones, undistinguished as craft and ’

unconvincing as art. (And too many of the
really good female photographers in
America today are missing — Claire Stein-
berg, Lynn Davis, Jane O’Neal, Jennifer
Griffiths, even Annie Leibowitz, even De-
borah Turbinville.)

The equivocatory introduction and pre-
tentious text are by Ingrid Bengis, author of
Combat in the Erogenous Zone.

Another, rather more interesting, volume
of photographs of men is Danseur: The Male
in Ballet (A Rutledge Book, McGraw-Hill,
$19.95) by Richard Philp and Mary Whit-
ney. “Ballet has long been stigmatized by
men in America,” the authors note, “as a
‘sissy’, ‘elitist’ art form, but as dance in-
creases in popularity and our society relaxes
its puritanical guard about male self-
expression, more and more men are at-
tracted to dance.” Some of the most famous
andibest of the men who have been attracted
to dance, despitegits stigrriata, in the recent
and distant past — from Nijinsky to
Nureyev to Richard Cragun, Anthony Dow-
ell, and the remarkable Peter Martins — are
shown here, in action, in rehearsal, and in
repose. The text is sensible and the photo-
graphs, which include some original mate-
rial by Herbert Migdoll, art director of
Dance Magazine and After Dark, are emi-
nently workmanlike.

Dream Diary (William Morrow, $4.95) is a
harmless non-book — a cleanly designed lit-
tle journal inspired by Hugh Lynn Cayce’s
advice that “The best book on dreams you
will ever read is the one you write yourself.”

Four middle—aged black rum?

Kiss: Alive ll (Casablanca)

Alice Cooper:
The Alice Cooper Show (Warner Bros.)

. Sammy Davis Jr.:

A Live Perfomianoe of His Greatest Hits
(Warner Bros.)

There’s a story going around in music busi-
ness circles that’s so hot you won’t read it in
the major magazines. Rolling Stone, Circus,
Crawdaddy, and even 771: Jllusic Gig are stay-
ing away from this one. Editors point out
that the story is simply unsubstantiated
rumor, based on circumstantial evidence.
VV ell, a lot of good people have gone to the
electric chair for less! So here goes, and re-
member that you heard it here, first.

It all started with Led Zeppelin. VVhen
jimmy Page and john Paul Jones proved
that it was’ possible for session musicians to
make a huge amount of money if they were

to forget their principles, play loud, and yell
a lot, studio players around the world tried
to find a way to follow suit. Most of them,
though, were just too musical for their own
good.

But then, just a few years ago, several of
New York’s very best session men were hit
with inspiration. We can’t give their names
here — this is too hot — butjust look at the
back of any album made in New York dur-
ing the last ten years.

They could play loud, and they even
found someone who could yell nearly as ef-
fectively as Robert Plant. But there were
problems. The singer didn’t look at all like
Roger Daltrey (a prime requisite, they be-
lieved), and the players were all black and in
their forties. Hardly the acceptable image
for a power band.

A And so here’s where the inspiration came
in. The musicians would work in the studio,
creating the loudest records that they could.

Then they’d get a number of kids off the
street, paint them with makeup so that no-
body could tell what they really looked like,
and put them on the road pretending to play
over prerecorded tracks. Such details as per-
sonal background, deemed unimportant
anyway, were left to the record company
mythmakers, who were used to fabricating
careers on the spot.

Imagine! Every concert would sound just
like the record; there’d be no troublesome
ego problem (if one of the road “musicians”
gave any trouble, he could be replaced —— as
several have — and no one would be the
wiser); the entire career could be carefully
controlled; and the studio musicians would
never have to go on the road. They could
remain in New York and make their usual
triple-scale backing up sensitive singer-
songwriters and cutting one-take disco ses-
sions.

Now there’s no way that any of this can be

proven. It was too carefully planned for
that. But listen to “Beth” and tell me that
that track isn’t prerecorded. Anybody who
attended the concert (as I did) can tell you
that "Detroit Rock City” was an encore, not
the first number played. If they’ll ﬁddle
around that much, why not all the way? And
why is it that the chief thing to have been
written about Kiss and issued through oili-
cial channels is a comic book? Huh?

Now if all of that is true, we’ve got to
admire the New York studio musicians for
doing a finejob. Kiss arejust as loud as  = "
Zeppelin, and nearly as unsophisticatet.
musically (can’t expect these guys to have
unleamed everything, after all). The choice
of an old -Dave Clark Five cut (“Any V)/ay
You \\'ant Me”) is perfect: the Five were
pulling this sort of thing on their audiences
at the start of the Beatles era. For any band,
even Kiss, to be able to do a Dave Clark
number more crudely than Clark himself

proves that these guys are not fooling
around.  I ‘

Side Four has no applause on it. What

could the guys have been doing wrong?
, Alice Cooper’s “live” album, recorded
during his last tour, was meant to sum up his
career thus far. That it could be done, and in
under 40 minutes, tells more about Alice
than I could. After completing the vocal
overdubs (What? Him, too?) on this album,
Cooper went to the hospital to dry himself
out.

The playing, by Dick Wagner, Steve
Hunter, Penti Glan and Prakash john, is
superb heavy rock and roll. Cooper’s songs
are a matter of taste: for mine, “I’m Eight-
een” and “School’s Out” are among rock’s
greatest anthems, but stuff like “I Love the
Dead” (and no, he’s not talking about Jerry
Garcia), “Is It My Body,” and “Sick
Things,” are pretty silly after the first time
through. i ‘

The entire album sounds as fine as a fan
could want and should be pretty definitive.
Oh, yes, the two ballads “You and Me” and
“Only Women Bleed” are here, too.

People may kid about Sammy Davis _]r.,-

but even his detractors must admit that he
puts on a hell of a show. Singing, dancing,
impressions — they’re all here. Plus Sam’s
own inimitible patter between the numbers,
not to mention the clanking of heavy
jewelry. Included are such all time favorites
as “Talk to the Animals,” “Mr. Bojangles”
(your heart will cry during this one, Sammy
packs so much emotion into it), “I Gotta Be
Me,” “What Kind of Fool Am I,” “Baret-
ta’s Theme,” and of course the jubilant
“Candy Man.” If you buy this album, you
can toss out all of the rest of your Sammy
Davis Jr. albums, that’s for sure. A beautiful
man. A great entertainer.

He’s so good, in fact, that with a little
clown makeup, he could go on the road with
Kiss. Then he’d be making some real money.

Piper: can’t wait (A&M)
Rpx: Where Do We Go from Here (CBS)

I DADADADA, and aren’t you glad you took

your Benzedrine this morning? In recent
years, chunka-chunka dynorock stylisms
and pretty-boy vocal infatuations have
typified the current crop of heavy-metal
piledriver ensembles, and Piper and Rex
(along with Cheap Trick,_Detective, Starz,
most of the New Wave neurotics, and a host
of other megadeath axe victims) rush right
along with amphetamine urgency and con-
temporary claptrap lyrical invocations, a
slew of new toys in the attic to tide you over
until Aerosmith (reigning guitar gods and
standard-bearers of the syndrome) get
around to releasing their next sonic sensa-
tion. I must admit to a certain partiality to
this type of electroshock mindrot, but how
many Steven Tyler clones can rock ‘n’ roll
cope with?

At least one more, according to Rex
Smith, method frontman and androgynous
sex stud for (how’s this for modesty?) Rex,
latest in a long line of misguided. Rolling
Stones survivors; it’s only rock and roll, but
we fake it, make it, yes we do. Where Do We
Go from Here is basically the same old song
and dance that’s been recycled from 12 x 5
since the invention of feedback, which
makes the album as bad as any punk postur-
ing or as good as Rocks, depending on your
musical inclinations and/ or blood toxica-
tion. Nothing mindshattering here, just a
bunch of I-IV-V Jimmy Page progressions,
castration shrieks, and token slow songs for
the teen queens to swoon over, but I’m not
complaining (yet). A

In the same league as Rex, but higher in

the proﬁciency standings, is Piper, another
Boston "(the town) be-bop outfit complete
with three, count ‘em, 3 guitarists, Mick
_]agger’s alter-ego at the mike, and enough
curly hair for a busload of Peter Framptons.
Their second LP, Can’t Wait, maintains the
warp-drive ferocity so essential to the genre,
while churning out plentiful helpings of bla-
tant Boston (the group) bombast and teen-
age paranoia for the Ted Nugent terrorists
in your neighborhood. Songs like “Little
Miss Intent,” “Bad Boy,” and “Blues for
the Common Man” would sound fine on
any (insertsdistorto-rock band of your
choice) album, while Billy Squier screams,
struts, and serenades as well as anyone. Un-
conditionally guaranteed, and not one safety
pin in sight. Get it before it gets you.

If your idea of an entertaining evening at
home is curling up with your horoscope
while listening to Rumours, then these al-
bums are deﬁnitly not for you. But, if you’re
one of those quazy Quaalude queatures who
gets off on blasting old Deep Purple records
at decibel levels that give your pet rock a
headache, grab one of these, take twenty
sopors at fifteen-minute intervals, and let it
-rock. It may not be Nirvana, but it sure
beats disco, the dishes or Dan Fogelberg.
Proceed at your own risk.

Chris Clark

Urbie Green
Seﬁor Blues: (CTI)
Art Farmer
Something You Got (CTI)

Tying ‘these albums together is their simul-
taneous release and the fact that both “lead-
ers” are backed by Dave Matthews’ small-
sounding big band. Many of the things that
people don’t like about CTI albums are
missing: no vocal choruses, Joe Beck, no
soul-disco, no Bob James, and there is little
over-extension of the arrangements, and
only one obvious inclusion of a song (“I’m
in You,” on the Green album) for pure

' commercial reasons.

CTI’s virtues happily remain. The music
is nicely recorded, respectfully packaged,
and certainly pleasant to listen to. The only
people likely to be offended by the music
here are those who believe that jazz is, -by
nature, wildly experimental.

Both albums mix pop material, jazz stan-
dards, and Matthews’ originals in a particu-
larly challenging variety; whoever selected
the material deserves commendation in both
cases. -Matthews’ charts, often reﬂecting. a
Gil Evans influence, are likewise imagina-
tive.

Songs on,Green’s album include Chick
Corea’s “Captain Marvel,” Charles Min-
gus’s “Ysabel’s Table Dance, Horace Silver’s
“Senor Blues,” Stevie Wonder’s “I VVish,”
Billy Preston’s “You Are So Beautiful,” and
the above-mentioned Peter F rampton tune.
Farmer plays Chris Kenner’s “Something
You Got,” Corea’s “Spain,” Clifford
Brown’s “Sandu,” plus a couple of new ti-
tles.

Band personneliis largely the same for
both albums, with super guitarist john
Scofield replaced by also-fine Hiram Bullock
on Farmer’s set. Not unexpectedly, trom-
bonist Green and trumpeter Farmer get
most of the solo space, but several of the
other musicians do get some licks in, notably
Grover Washington, Jr. and Frank Vicari
on Green’s album, and Yusef Lateef on
Farmer’s.

Though Cynics might say that CTI’s al-
bums _generally qualify as elevator music,
the very least that can be said about these
two is that they take that elevator music to a
higher level.

ames are serious business. Last year, Ameri-
cans spent more than $300 million on board
games alone (not counting electronic games
or sporty’games like badminton). Since
Monopoly, the all-time favorite board game,
was invented in 1935, it has sold 80 million copies, not
including its success in 27 foreign countries. Runners-up in
popularity are Parcheesi (the oldest, imported from India in
1867) and Scrabble, the baby of the bunch, invented in
1948. Pretenders to the Game Throne are Risk, The Game‘
of Life and Diplomacy. But those are all pretty familiar by
now. We decided to ignore these — and the backgammon
phenomenon, about which too much has already been writ-
ten.

We set out to show you something New. Or at least
Different. Gripped with the spirit of idealistic consumer re-
search, clutched by a desire to help Ampersand readers make
difficult choices in the days ahead, and tickled by a yen to
play some games, we. sallied forth to a toy store. Our pur-
pose: to buy, play and evaluate new games. A Reader Serv-
ice.

It should be noted here that the Milton Bradley company,
largest manufacturer of games in this country, tests and
evaluates its proposed games over a ten-to-eighteen-month
period, sometimes spending as much as $500,000 on such
research before they ever put the thing on the market. We
didn’t do quite that much.

Armed with very little information and naive determina-
tion, Publisher Achee and Editor Sims found themselves
faced with about 500 shelf feet of games in the “adult”
section. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe worked for awhile; then
they went by manufacturers (one Avalon Hill, one Kenner,
etc.), and finally switched to impulse (the brightest colored
packages won here).

Their Selections

Boggle (Parker), Spill & Spell (Parker), Panzer Leader (Av-
alon Hill), The Guinness Game of World Records (Parker),
The Ungame (Ungame Inc.), Star Wars (Kenner), and Pet-
ropolis (Pressman).

 

The Test Setting
The palatially furnished tenement apartment of our pub-
lishers in Fox Hills, a hitherto unknown section of Los

Angeles. They served potato chips and a sour cream dip.
The wine was OK, but M&M’s?

   

The entire Ampersand staff—Achee, Dickey, Everett, Hatch,
Lampton, Rice and Sims, ﬂeshed out (figuratively speaking)
with friends (victims) Pete Senoff and Denise Galvin, plus
two children, Lori and Kelley, rented for the occasion (and
their Young Opinions).

 
The Script

Each game, in no particular order, was played and then
rated according to time required to set up and learn; degree
of challenge and hilarity; attractiveness of packaging; and
space was provided for suggested improvement.

 

The Results

We won’t save the best for last. The hands-down winner of
the day, which kept ﬁve people riveted to a card table for
four hours (long moments of silence followed by groans of
dismay and whoops of triumph) was Boggle. That’s right, a
simple word game, where players try to make as many
words as possible from a number of adjacent letters. Great

fun; no doubt about it.
Spill & Spell, another word game (no we weren’t all

editors and writers), was the runner-up. With this one,
small letter cubes are shaken up, tossed out, and then ar-
ranged in as many (preferably long) words as possible,
crossword~puzzle-style, within three minutes. Nerve-

wracking.
The silliest game of the day had to be Guinness, a board-

stunt-trivia ordeal during which children and grownups
alike demonstrated their total lack of coordination. Guin-
ness makes you DO things, like tiddly winks, bouncing a
ping-pong ball off a piece of paper, and other feats of worth-
less prowess. The multiple choice or true/false questions
from the Guinness Book of World Records weren’t terribly dif-
ficult, and the answers were far too abrupt: “Which is
smaller? A. smallest reptile B. Heaviest insect.” The answer
is A, but wouldn’t you like to know which reptile is so tiny?
Presumably, this game was devised so people would have to
buy the book. Only one person said she’d like to buy Guin-
ness: one of the kids, not surprisingly.

Star Wars wasn’t as bad as everyone thought it would be;
the kids liked it, especially when their opponents were sent
to the Trash Compactor, but the ‘game had some serious

drawbacks. Too easy, for one (players ranged in age from 8
to 32; the 8-year-old won, much to the chagrin of the 32-
year-old). Too awkward, for another: the playing pieces
were too large. Most players agreed they would play Star
Wars again—but they wouldn’t big» it.

Petropolis is a lot like Monopoly, played with Petro-
dollars instead of mere dollars. Deals are made, monopolies
maneuvered and rents charged, but instead of Boardwalk
and Park Place, the prime real estate here is Saudi Arabia

, ($1,000,000). Inﬂation is everywhere.

The Ungame. Blech, yuck and phooey. This is one of
those dumb psychological tell-the-truth games where
players can wander aimlessly around a board picking cards
which pose tasks and questions: “Give one word to describe
each person in the group.” There are two sets of cards, one
called “Light-hearted,” the other “Deep understanding.”
No one wins or loses; it really is an Ungame. All this is
meant quite seriously; it’s supposed to help you get to know
your fellow players. This may be nifty if you’re playing with
Norman Mailer, Joni Mitchell, or Fidel Castro, (they’re not
so hot either, now that we think of it), but for us, nix.

Panzer Leader was too intimidating, with maps and thick

. book of instructions and tiny little squares with letters and

numbers. We gave up before we started. Figured it would
take less time to re-fight World War II than learn this game.
If you start Panzer Leader when you enter college, you’ll
probably have it set up and ready for play by the time you
graduate. Nobody could ever say you wasted four years.

That’s it, folks. Our First (and probably last) Annual
Game Tasting Party. If any of these games inspire you with
a spirit of competition and greed——just think how useful
th'ey’ll be during final exam week.

SEPTEMBER 9, 1977 — Randy Newman

explains the significance of “Short People” thus:

*1, 3. “See, I ’m real fond of ‘Short People,’ but all it is, is
" -~ funny. It isn’t quite only funny, because I think a lot
 of people who are short do feel victimized. ”

I I “Then you’re giving their worst paranoid ﬂash
substance, ” suggests the interviewer. ’

“That’s right. But I don’t think that’s insulting.

It’s close, just like ‘Rednecks’ was, but I think 
people can laugh at the ridiculousness Qf feeling that

just because you have a real tiny little penis . . .” He
dissolves into easy, hoarse laughter.

“No,” he chokes. “I can’t help it. I hate ’em. ”

February, 1978

all

hree months later, “Short People” is
Randy Newman’s ﬁrst Big Hit Single,
but he remains every bit as unwilling to
take it too seriously. Like his oldest
fans, he is both surprised and a bit skeptical
of its success; he knows the record is being
played over car radios and as the soundtrack
for the daily chores of countless housewives
and school kids, sandwiched between the
hyperkinetic doggerel of station jingles and
hit parade Countdowns.

“I mean, this is luck, this kind of thing,”
Newman cautioned. “I don’t think I can do
this all the time. I don’t know. I just don’t
have the feeling I could come out with hit
singles all the time. I’d like to, but I think I
write too oddly to do that.” Later, he broke
up again, considering the consequences of
his cheerful attack on people of, ahem, mod-
est stature, for the theoretical 10-year-old
who goes out and buys the album. “A shat-
tering experience,” he predicted with
wicked glee.

Newman could be one "of his own char-
acters. Neither physically nor conversation-
ally imposing, he is a perfect criminal:
medium height, medium build, no distinguishing features
beyond that occasionally stoic mouth and delictate chin and
a nimbus of curly dark brown hair. Sitting in a curved Colo-
nial armchair in his manager’s Beverly Hills office, Newman
laughs easily, deﬂecting any sense of high seriousness unless
we talked about the music itself: then his deft humor was
reined, his answers brief and direct. He is unusually pale for
‘an Angeleno, making it clear he doesn’t live here for his
health; his speech, delivered in a slightly nasal, dry voice, is
an amalgam of western, southern and — oddly — a certain
New York tautness that appears to have no geographical
cause. He laughs often and easily, revealing rather small,
even teeth.

“I wouldn’t be short for anything,” he told me laconi-
cally. “That’s almost as bad as being foreign.”

At 33, and 5’ 1 1”, Randy Newman has been offsetting the
gravity of his work with the same affable, rather self-

, deprecating humor for nearly a decade, not only in inter-

views but onstage and in the songs themselves, which often
openly mock fame (“Heroes and glamor: I don’t believe in
heroes, and glamor is bullshit,” he observed during our ﬁrst
interview). His protestations, taking the form of self—parody
at the keyboard and periodic confessions of his lazy, some-
what fumbling approach to his career, have failed to under-
mine a critical reputation as a brilliant maverick, a true pop
genius. A quintessential cult ﬁgure, Newman was impervi-
ous to his early commercial failure; when his first ‘albums
sold dismally, his record company, Warner Bros., trum-
peted the news, wearing their red ink like a badge of honor.

Newman has never been considered a prototypical “sensi-
tive singer-songwriter.” Particularly when viewed from an
auditorium seat, Randy Newman is, well, too funny: eyes
shaded by lids that never rise above half-mast, backed not
by a wall of ampliﬁcation and thundering drums but by his
spare, loping piano style, he sloaches forward into the mi-
crophone, the antithesis of the rock hero. When he sings, it is
through what Warren Zevon, another Californian songwri-
ter, calls “a mouth without lips, an angry comma.” Extol-
ling the virtues of slavery, muttering oblique but ominous
threats to a harassed lover, or preparing for sexual rejection,
he draws charged laughter from his listeners. But on record,
without reassuring titters or ad-libbed comic relief, the
same lyrics darken. The lurking deviate who sings to
“Suzanne” seems at once both pathetic and menacing; the
frustration and rage boiling beneath the block-headed
camaraderie of “Rednecks” breaks through its relaxed
major-keyed melody and seemingly comedic exaggerations
to rub salt into old but raw wounds.

Newman’s refusalto plumb the familiar depths of con-
ventional romantic songwriting began early in his career,
before he began performing his own work, when singers like

Judy Collins (“I Think It’s Going to Rain Today”) and
England’s Alan Price (“Simon Smith and the Amazing
Dancing Bear,” “Tickle Me,” and others) recorded songs
which indicated that Newman had practically bypassed
adolescent passions central to early ‘60s pop and rock.

“I mean, what I do now didn’t exist when I started, when
I was 16 or so,” he said.» “That’s more than half my life,
now, that I’ve been getting paid.” What did exist was
assembly-line pop, which needed catchy if disposable songs
on which to hang pleading vocals and impassioned ar-

rangements. Newman’s abilities as a musician were already
apparent, and given the ﬁlm scoring credentials of his un-
cles, composers Alfred  Lionel Newman, Randy’s pre-
cocity led friend and future producer Lenny Waronker to
encourage him to write. Newman remembers singles by
Gene McDaniels and The Fleetwoods with titles like the
latters’ “They Tell Me It’s Summer.” He would prefer to
forget an early attempt to ﬁise his twin enthusiasms of music
and football, a Pat Boone single called “Golden Gridiron
Boy.” (“Oh_]esus,” Newman groaned when reminded of the
record, “that was a long time ago . . . It was a disaster, it
stunk.”) ‘

By the mid-‘60s, he was no longer attempting a reconcilia-
tion with time-honored pop themes, although his melodic
style was laced with tonal Americana. A general shift
toward self-contained writing performers likely helped spur
Newman to begin recording the songs himself. By his fourth
album, 1972’s Sail Away, sales tallies had started catching up
with his reveiws, but that cHdn’t prevent him from waiting
nearly three years to complete a conceptual follow-up, Good
Old Boys. A loosely structured opera exploring the contradic-
tory sensibilities of the modern South, where Newman was
born (in New Orleans) and from whence he has culled both
melodic ideas and a certain drawled, drowsy diction for his
characters, the album marked another extension of his audi-
ence, despite the volatility of the themes explored in the
songs.

Still, even the added momentum generated by that record
couldn’t dissuade him from wanting another three years to

 

. t/zat’s
almost as bad as being foreign. ”

“I wouldn’t be short for aryrt/zing . .

finish his sixth and current album, Little Criminals. A few
days after completing the album, Newman expressed un-
characteristic satisfaction with the results, guardedly agree-
ing there was evidence of Commercial Potential. “What can
I tell you?” he said. “I think it’s good, and I’ve never
thought that before. I mean, it could be that I’m wrong this
time — everyone else thought the others were good. And I
think they’re good in retrospect. But there’s some good stuff
on this. I think it’s going to be very difficult for the people
selling it. Some of it’s very easy, almost commercial. But
there’s so many different people, third person stuff: a child
murderer [“In Germany Before the War”], “Texas Girl at
the Funeral of Her Father,” this kid who’s a delinquent type
[the title song]. There’s a song about a police parade [“_]olly
Coppers on'Parade”], my first fascist song, I think . . . I’m
worried about it. They’ll relate me to Ronald Reagan or
something.”

If anything, the rapid airwave conquest by “Short

People” worried him even more. “You know, there’s some-
thing about this that doesn’t make me quite . . . happy . . .
I’d like_ to know what the album would do without it,” he
now wonders. “But it doesn’t work like that."

It’s a familiar note of resignation, buffered by off-hand
delivery, but no one really expects him to zero in on broad
comedy, something. he has rarely done (earlier, he had
criticized another broadside, “Political Science,” by agree-
ing the song is closer to ’50s satirist Tom Lehrer than most
Newman songs). “Maybe I’ll have to do some Jim Stafford
songs or something, or ‘The Purple People Eater,”’he
mused. but later he addressed the problem more directly. .

“I’m fearful of the prospect of the crowd’s changing to the
extent — see, I can ﬁnd a bad side to anything — where I
can’t get away with doing ‘Davy The Fat Boy’ or ‘God’s
Song,’ stuff like that.” Still, there is the quick punchline to

, lighten the load, much as his double entendres or fractured

narrative myopia leaven a basically existential thread that
runs throughout his writing. “I like the Rod Stewart record
‘You’re In My Heart,’ though. That’s funnier than ‘Short
People’: He loves her despite the fact that he disapproves of
her fashion sense. He’s my hero. There’s stuff on that record
I don’t believe, real jet set stuff.” Does this mean he’s ready
for neck chains and a deep suntan? He enthusiastically as-
sents. “Yeah, I’m ready. Maybe I’ll get a divorce. Well, I’ll
do something to keep my name in the news.”

Randy Newman won’t be wearing neck chains, and his
marriage (to a German woman, Roswitha; they have two
sons, Eric and Amos) has already outlasted usual Hol-
lywood expectations.But then Newman doesn’t live in Hol-
lywood; he lives on his own dimly-lit “Main Street” in Santa
Monica Canyon, far from the hip bustle of Sunset Strip or

the heavy-handed opulence of Beverly Hills, the distance e

measured in attitudes expressed in his songs. He will con-
tinue to procrastinate, only to insist later that he is really
very greedy; when a given project collapses, like his scor-
ing/songwriting assignment for Robert Altman’s scuttled film
of E.L. Doctorow’s Ragtime, he’ll shrug it off with an anecdote.

Newman had previously been mis-used by producer
Norman Lear (who tucked his songs rather neatly into the
background of a feature ﬁlm, Cold Turkey)‘ and practically
cannibalized by the producers of a television drama about
Huey Long, which employed several tracks from N ewman’ s
Good Old Boys album that described Long’s power as an
image of blue collar demagoguery. For the Altman project,
there was the promise of a more central role, as well as
Newman’s seasoned pianistics, which had long employed
ragtime ﬁgures.

“Dino De Laurentiis called Elliot (Abbot, Newman’s
manager) andsaid, ‘We want to see him.’ So we went down
there to see him, much like this.” He indicates his own
inﬂexible fashion sense of jeans and shirt. “Not even dressed
this well. Elliot looked like he looks, and we went in, and

‘ there He was. A real whirlwind. He hands me this book:

‘We want you to do this, we’ll ﬂy you to Canada to see
Altman, blah, blah, blah.’

“He was fantastic. I mean, if he terminated the project,
I’d like to get ﬁred by him.” He was laughing, and he really
meant it; he’d simply enjoy the audience with the producer.
“I mean, I never heard what happened. But he was the
greatest, _I loved him: speaking Italian and calling Yucatan.
Elliot and I were back out on the street and it was like we’d
been hit by a truck.”

So Randy Newman snatches humor from the jaws of de- ._

feat, which is more or less consistent with his songs; but
while that light tone is intended to discourage ‘us — and, one
suspects, the writer himself — from taking his work too
seriously, even the most irreverent Newrnanism can’t eclipse
the fatalism behind his lop-sided grin._ Little Criminals, with
its punchy rhythm section, hard-edged guitar and guest ap-
pearance by the Eagles, nevertheless continues Newman’s
odyssey as a composer of tersely evocative melodies ‘and a
lyricist of unﬂinching candor.

There are a few arguable commercial precedents for that
verbal darkness, notably Paul Simon and Steely Dan, but
Randy Newman is still facing certain dispiriting verities of
the national character that would seem unwelcome in an era
when popular culture generally evinces a preference for
anaesthesia, as reflected in the resurgence of traditional
romantic formulae and'a pervasive public hunger for es-
capism in a variety of forms. Sometimes Randy Newman
implies that he, too, would like to escape. His songs say that
he can’t.

 HOLLYWOOD 
or-:s To win 

  Again

 

BY JACOBA ATLAS

War may be Hell, but to Hollywood it has been the nearest
thing to box-office Heaven; War movies bolstered morale,
explained strategy, rallied idealism and generally served
The Cause. They also made people rich. War movies are a
capitalist’s dream, and like detective movies, the western
and the musical, war movies are an American specialty.
Other countries can and do make war movies, but the
genre’s perfection came from the U.S. of A., perhaps be-
cause during both World Wars, we stayed clear of the action
long enough to turn our resources to movies rather than the
military.

Then, a decade ago, after more than 50 years of successful
box-office battle, Hollywood in the sixties gave a war and no
one came. The film generation, that celluloid-happy audi-
ence demographically between the magic ages 18-30, wasn’t
interested in waving the flag, except in protest. As the Viet
Nam war escalated, the market for war ﬁlms diminished. It
became impossible to use the traditional guidelines of good
guys and bad guys, and unless those battle lines could be
drawn, there was no way of making a commercial hit.

The country was politically and morally divided about
Viet Nam, and that made all wars suspect. Hollywood re-
sponded to this ambiguity by taking its usual aflirmative
stand: it ignored the subject cpmpletely. Except for one or two
films made during the Sixties, such as Alice’: Restaurant, the
industry pretended the war didn’t exist. A few forays into
student protest, such as the disastrous Getting Straight or 771:
Strawbery Statement, told Hollywood pundits that student un-
rest and revolution weren’t box-oﬂice dynamite, and what-
ever creative impulse might have led filmmakers to come to

terms with the fundamental issues pulling America apart
during the Sixties and early Seventies was nipped in the bud.

But war is once again in bloom, with studios putting up big
dollars hoping for big revenues. Perhaps the time is right,
we’re safe enough now to open old wounds; maybe it is simply
impossible to look the other way any longer. Or perhaps there
is another, more cynical modus operandi: war movies offer a
great storehouse of material, and Hollywood is desperate for
good scripts. War is intrinsically dramatic, exciting, danger-
ous, heroic even in the most ambiguous situations. A writer
needs very little imagination to write a powerful war movie;
men in crisis write their own sagas, as Irwin Shaw (The Young
Lions) and James Jones (From Here to Eternity) have said on
more than one occasion.

It’s easy to understand the appeal of World War II. This

war still remains the only recent conflict where there were

clear-cut issues and easily defined heroes and villains. In-
terestingly enough though, this black and white dichotomy is
only true for Americans: European filmmakers, those born
and raised during the rise of Fascism, are now exploring their
past with the same trepidation our ﬁlmmakers are showing
Viet Nam. However, for American ﬁlmmakers World War II
is still the War of Wars.

But the impulse to investigate Viet Nam springs from the
much more elusive effort to come to grips with our country’s
recent traumatic history. Although Viet Nam films will no
doubt offer as much blood and guts as their World War II
counterparts, it will be impossible, even for a ﬁlm like Francis
Coppola’s epic Apocalypse Now, to couch the brutality of the

war in glamour and romance — two commodities totally
missing from this Asian encounter.

Viet Nam still divides this country; the publishing world
can testify to the lack of dollars for war tomes. Such books
may win awards, but today they rarely ﬁll best-selling lists.
The Viet Nam war has not produced popular novelists such
as James Jones, Norman Mailer or Irwin Shaw and such
admirable recent works as A Rumor of War by Philip Caputo
do only reasonably well; not nearly well enough. It’s doubtful
the great American populace wants to spend its hard-earned
money reliving the war, but American movie makers may not
give them a choice.

The great fear in Hollywood is a battle-backlash, a boycott
of the very subject matter which currently grips some of Hol-
lywood’s best ﬁlmmakers. This situation is unique: usually
movies strive to reflect the mood of America, not create it. It’s
apparent America’s mood does not relish reflecting on war, so
Hollywood is gambling with films which treat Viet Nam seri-
ously. Filmmakers are betting they can shake America out of
its apathy and force us to take a long look at troubled times. If
Hollywood succeeds, it’ll be one of the few times the industry
has taken a strong political stand against the economic pres-
sures of the profit motive.

Any discussion of Viet Nam movies must begin with Fran-
cis Coppola’s Apocalypse Now. The script was written in 1969
by a very young, very confused John Milius and bounced
around the studios for almost five years. The original version
is filled with adolescent battle fantasies about the end of the
world and the nature of evil, so much so that one studio
executive called it Infantile. Coppola saw something else

(more?) in the treatment of Viet Nam and bought the script.
After forking over the asking price, Coppola immediately
began rewriting, to such an extent that Millus, once Coppo-
la’s good friend, is now barely on speaking terms with the
older director.

It’s widely agreed that Apocalypse Now is based on Joseph
Conrad’s brilliant novel, Heart of Darkness, but one reader of
the Milius/Coppola script calls that bunk — intellectual
posturing by sycophants who wouldn’t read Conrad anymore
than -they’d thank their agents. However, certain similarities
do exist.

“We came upon a man of war anchored off the coast,”
wrote Conrad; Coppola’s man of war is anchored on a Viet
Nam river, skippered by a captain also named Kurtz (played
by Marlon Brando), who sails up the river into the heart of
darkness and tries to ‘tame the natives’ through perversity
and violence. Kurtz’s mission becomes para-military and
eventually the high command sends up another war-lord,
played by Martin Sheen, to terminate Kurtz.

Apocalypse Now was orginally bankrolled by United Artists
for a tidy $8 million dollars. Conservative estimates now put
the ﬁlm at $25.5 million, making it the most expensively
budgeted in movie history. Monsoon rains, hurricanes and
other natural disasters, along with bruised egos and Martin
Sheen’s heart attack, contributed to the ﬁlm’s lengthy, de-
bilitating schedule. Coppola lost forty pounds; reorganized
his ﬁlm company; mortgaged everything he owns or may
own, including future percentages of The Godfathers I and II;
and according to sources on the film, went through some of
the same horriﬁc changes as Conrad’s Kurtz. Coppola is in
fact so aware of the public fascination with the situation sur-
rounding Apocalypse Now (_ can that fascination be translated
into box-ofﬁce dollars?) that he issued an official memo order-

‘ing his employees not to talk to the press.

In one of the few public statements Coppola has issued
about the ﬁlm, he says tersely, “I’m cauterizing old wounds.
Trying to let people put the war behind them. You can never
do that by forgetting.”

So ﬁlmmakers would like us to be past forgetting. Jane
Fonda is another member of the let’s-think—about-it-first
brigade. Her upcoming ﬁlm, Coming Home, due for release in
January, takes a look at returning Vets and what the war did
to the psyches of men and women. VVritten by Waldo Salt
(Midnight Cowboy) and directed by Hal Ashby (Bound for
G109), Coming Home is the story of a woman married to a
Marine Viet Nam vet (Bruce Dern) who falls in love with a
paraplegic (Ion Voight). Her Marine husband, unable to
come to grips with the contradictory information about
heroism, manliness and the war, chooses suicide as an alter-
native.

jane sees the film as a strong statement about the war,
fatigue and personal commitment. She also sees it as a truly
feminist film. “The part I play is a conservative, male-deﬁned
Marine ofﬁcer’s wife. She married her ex-football player

when she was just out of high school. She views the whole
world through his eyes, but then she begins to go through
some changes. Now, there are millions and millions of women
just like her. And if we can begin to show her the way she
really is, she can be a kind of heroine.” I

Viet Nam vets may have been heroes, but to themselves
and the rest of the country, they were psychologically scarred
victims at best. Coming Home deals with that torture; so does
john Milius’ ode to Sixties friendships, Big Wednesday. The
ironically titled Heroes with Henry Winkler also shows a
mind-damaged veteran. '

The Deer Hunter, with Robert De N iro, ﬁlters back and forth
between the war zone and the home-front; The Boys in Company
C and Go Tell the Spartans both deal directly with soldiers
during the heat of battle. Dog Soldiers takes the drug scene in
Viet Nam stateside and shows a group of vets dealing the
hard stuff.

To be sure, World War II produced a fair share of ﬁlms
about war’s tragic aftermath, including the highly regarded
Best Years Of0ur Lives, Home cyfthe Brave, and The Men. But the
overall message of those movies was optimism, the American
spirit triumphant against all odds. With World War II, when
all else failed, a viewing of the concentration camps put every-
thing back into perspective. But it’s impossible to put the
egos, miscalculations and greed of the American military
industrial complex to that same use.

The Deer Hunter, Boys in Company C, Go Tell the Spartans,
Coming Home and the Dog Soldiers have been condemned by
the State Department and the Defense Department. These
two government agencies insist producers only want to show
the “unattractive side of Viet Nam, the inﬂated drug scene;
the mundane chore of saving Viet Namese lives, the things
men went through day in and day out, wasn’t very appeal-
ing.”

It’s a grim thought, but the Defense department may be
right. There’s an uncomfortable feeling surrounding some of
the Viet Nam ﬁlms that smacks of exploitation. These ﬁlms
may indeed be the strong political statements needed to bal-
ance the war, or they may be nothing more than potboilers
designed to show off violence, like the reprehensible Rolling
Thunder, which used a Viet Nam vet as a vehicle for un-
civilized destruction.

«' War movies have traditionally pleased everyone: studios,
audiences, even the State Department. Our government
readily concedes World War II would have been even harder
to ﬁght without the support of Hollywood through training
ﬁlms, propaganda movies and just good old morale boosters.
Films like the Sands oflwojima and Th9’ Were Expendable have
even been cited as recruiting tools. It’s doubtful Apocalypse
Now, The Deer Hunter and Coming Home will serve the same
purpose. The closest we’re going to get to ﬂag waving is
Coppola’s statement that his ﬁlm “is honest, pro-human and
therefore pro-American.”

Considering the trauma of Viet Nam, no one should expect
more. 5

With the give-arid-get spirit of the holiday
season just past, it may be financially com-
forting to know that for hi ﬁ the New Year is
bargain time. During the first week in Jan-
uary l978 high-fidelity manufacturers will
be removing the wraps on new product lines
and encouraging their dealers to clear the
shelves. A bit of canny shopping will help
you uncover audio bargains and a number
of special hi-ﬁ deals. The prices indicated
here are ‘tops’ - you should be able to do

better.
The ﬁrst component in the cornucopia is

Sansui’s Model G-2000 AM/ F M receiver. It
pushes out 16 audio watts, so your accom-
panying speakers should be fairly eflicient.
Stereo separation is 40dB at 1 kHz. With
proper speaker placement you should be able
to enjoy positive spatial effect. The G-2000
features an illuminated wide tuning dial, a
maximum signal strength and zero center
tuning meter. It also has the circuitry you’
would normally associate with more expen-
sive receivers: a four element ceramic IF ﬁlter
using integrated circuits, a phase-locked loop
diﬂ"er;ential demodulator for minimum har-
monic distortion and a low-pass ﬁlter to sup-
press carrier leakage. The receiver also in_-
cludes a mike mixing facility equipped with a
level control. ($230).

Looking for something out of the ordinary?
Consider the GLI Creative Controller, con-
sisting of a #3880 mixer module with a
#1000 signal processor. The Creative Con-
troller is ideal if you are an active audiophile
who wants to go beyond just listening to par-
ticipation. This unit will let you play disc
jockey atiparties, assembling tapes with ex-
cerpts dubbed from a multitude of sources, or

‘changing the tonal balance of a recording.
The Controller includes phono mixing and
dynamic range enhancement. If you couple it
to a multi-channel tape deck you can have
your own instant living room recording
studio. The unit, a pre-amp plus full controls,
lets you do deck-to-deck dubbing, apply
equalization to tape input or line output, use
cue input selectors and operate a slide fader
for two inputs. '

With some 200 speaker manufacturers
pouring out a product line" at a ﬁne rate,
selecting a speaker can be a bit more diflicult
than choosing a matefor life. If your power
amp can "supply from 12 to 60 watts per
channel, give some thought to the Leak 3050.
It is equipped with a pair of 1 70mm (6-3/4")
bass/mid range drivers and a 19mm (3/4")
dome tweeter, The operation of the bass units
up to the crossover at 3kHz is achieved by an
11 element crossover. In a conventional
speaker system the points of origin of sound
at diﬂerent frequencies aren’t the same dis-

’ tance ﬁ’om your cars. This results in time

distortion, an effect that is eliminated in the
Leak i 3050 since it is time-delay compen-
sated. The treble unit is mounted a precisely
calculated distance behind the plane of the
woofer panel so that the musical harmonics it
reproduces will arrive at your ears precisely
in step with the fundamental frequencies
from the dual woofer/midrange drivers.

The Wharfedale E70 (the E is for
efficiency) will play along with any stereo
power amp that can supply as little as 3 watts
per channel to as much as 120 watts, and that
just about includes everybody’s amp. Highly

eflicient, it can produce a sound pressure
level of 94dB at adistance of l meterwith just
1 watt input. It has a 250mm‘ (l0") woofer, a
pair of l(X)mm (4") midrange drivers and
one 25mm (l") horn loaded tweeter. Twin
5-position contour controls are an unusual
feature of the Wharfedale E-70, permitting
adaptability to individual room acoustics.-
You can get up to 5dB of frequency adjust-
ment in the 2(1) - 2kHz and 2 - 20kHz ranges.
Typical system response is virtually flat ﬁom
50 Hz to l8kHz. ($430) A

If you aren’t quite satisﬁed with the sound
you’ve been getting out of your phono rec-
ords, you might try changing from a moving
magnet cartridge, quite probably the type
you are now using, to a moving coil unit. The
Satin moving coil cartridge produces a full
2.5mV signal level, so you can plug it directly
into any photo ampliﬁer input. This car-
tridge also eliminates the nuisance of stylus
replacement, something that sometimes re-
quires the digital ability of a Heifetz or
Menuhin. You can do it yourself. The Satin
Model M-l8E has a 0.2 x 0.8 mill elliptical
diamond stylus and a rated frequency re-
sponse from l0Hz to 30kHz. Your cars
should work that good.

Cartridges vary widely in price (and in
quality). You can pay as little as $20 or go
beyond $200 with ease. A lot depends on
what pleases your ears, and that’s a purely
personal matter. Empire has a line of car-
tridges, from their model 2000 at $30 to their
20002 at $100. You can get a'Pickering
Micro IV AC for $24.95 or their discrete
4-channel cartridge, UV-15/2400Q, at $125.

Hitachi has a rather nice AM/F M tuner,
its Model FT-920. It has a light gold front
panel and a slightly recessed and back sloped
dial scale. One of the tuner’s unusual features
is an auto lock, a type of automatic frequency
control. This turns off the moment you start

turning the tuning knob. But when you stop ’

tuning, the auto lock comes on again and
holds the tuned station precisely. ($300)
There are several trends in turntables and

you might keep them in mind when sh0p- _

ping. Many manufacturers are now supply-
ing direct drive, but don’t discount belt drive.
Thorens, an old line company with a ﬁne
reputation, has belt-driven turntables in its
line. Quartz crystal oscillators for controlling
turntable speed seem to be the latest trend.
These supply just about perfect speed accu-
racy and levels of ﬂutter so low that it’s
difﬁcult to see how they could be measured.

Pioneer’s PL-570 is a fully automatic,
single play, direct drive record player with
speed control through a quartz crystal oscil-
lator. ($294). The Thorens TD-160 is a
belt-driven, single play unit, but is com-
pletely manual. ($275). Garrard’s GT55,
also belt driven, is $249.95.

Now that cassette decks have made the
grade as true high-ﬁdelity components, you
can have the convenience offered by cassettes
and the enjoyment of quality mund. Ken-
wood’s KX-1030 uses three separate heads
for erase, record and playback. And the com-
ponent has a frequency response of 35 Hz to
18 kHz, plus or minus 3 dB, when using
chrome tape. This unit is distinguished by
the fact that it has a double Dolby system
with separate circuits for the record and
playback ampliﬁers. This meansthat as you
record with Dolby, you can also tape monitor
with Dolby so you hear exactly what you rec-
ord.

Another unusual feature is the variable
bias adjustment control that lets you adjust
the exact bias for the kind of tape you use.
Most cassette decks have either a two'o_r a
three-position bias and equalization switch,
but with the Kenwood KX-l030 you should
be able to use any cassette tape, now avail-
able or coming at you in the ﬁxture.

The Lone Ranger

Ah, America. Land of Star Trek, Buffalo Bill,
Superman, jaws, and Walt Disney. Land of
supertechnology. Land without myth.

Not so, say Robert Jewett and John
Lawrence in The American Monomyth
(Doubleday). To be sure, Apollo no longer
does his daily number with the sun. But
Superman still soars across the sky and, in
seemingly endless reruns, Captain Kirk still
dribbles the Starship Enterprise like a basket-
ball across the cosmos. '

In the classical mythic set-up,’ a hero
brings useful information from the gods..
Power and knowledge go hand-in—hand.
Prometheus brings ﬁre to the earth. In the
American monomyth, however, the
superhero has "replaced the hero. The
superhero has power enough to perform
superheroic tasks, but he brings no new in-
formation. Instead he sets things straight.
He has what Jewett and Lawrence call a
“redemptive task.” "

Usually the superhero comes from out of
the blue, sacks the bad guy (men dominate
the examples-here), pulls a community out
of danger, and disappears.

Superman, of course, ﬁts this scheme per-

fectly. So does the Lone Ranger, The Virgi- -

nian and even Mary Poppins.

In the American’ monomyth, the
superhero goes one-on-one with the enemy.
He is often a violent anarchist (like Paul
Kersey in Death Wish). Usually he is a sexual
anarchist as well. Clark Kent is in love with
Lois Lane; Superman islnot. Captain Kirk
and Spock resist romantic involvement with
superseductive women. Mickey Mouse and
Snow White are sexless superheroes.

In addition, the American monomyth pic-
tures superheroes as having amazing pow-.
ers. Spock can calculate like a Hewlett-
Packard and is resistant to many human
dangers. Spiderman is equally at home on a
vertical or horizontal surface. Buffalo Bill
claimed to have killed sixty-nine buffalo in
one day. -

The authors point out that along with the
American monomyth, there is another
American myth, the myth of m_ythlessness——or
the myth that there is no American
monomyth. Because the monomyth is al-
ways available, disguised as entertainment,
we tend to overlook it. The authors sense a
danger here, since a “mythic formula” has
the potential to manipulate an audience.

Sometimes jewett and Lawrence stretch
the text a bit so the monomythic pattern will
not be disturbed. But in general their ac-
count is a believable one. They write in a
casual, quick, Shazam!-like style. It makes
for easy going. Star Trek addicts, media
aﬁcionados and comic-book fans should like

HIGH ANXIETY, starring Mel Brooks,
Madeline Kahn,-Harvey Korman, Cloris
Leachman. Produced and directed by
Brooks.

In High Anxiety Mel Brooks, so he says, sa-
lutes Alfred Hitchcock, the master of sus-
pense. Well, Hitchcock has withstood every-
thing from 1930’s "censorship to l970’s
semiology and he will, no doubt, survive
Brooks’ heavy-breathing, but the question is
— will audiences? Every laugh High Anxiety
elicits from an audience seems one more nail
in the coffin’ of American comedy. Right
now, except for Annie Hall, most of our film
humor is in ridiculing others, a manic
preoccupation with the comedy of cruelty.

Brooks often veers dangerously close to
this kind of humor —— the kick-’em-in-the-
stomach-when-they’re-down school of retch-
ing excess — but in the past, he also infused
his films with a wistful absurdity that let us
take the highs with the lows. Now even that
subtlety is totally missing and Brooks comes
on with the finesse ofa steam~roller.

In High Anxiety Brooks plays a psychiatrist
with a secret problem who is brought in to
head a mysterious hospital for The Very
Very Nervous. Strange goings-on happen at
the clinic and the plot revolves around
Brooks discovering the truth. Along the way
we’re treated to short “takes” on all of
Hitchcock’s most famous ﬁlms, including
the shower scene from Psycho, the waterfront
scene from Vertigo (shot at the same loca-
tion) as well as devices from such non-
Hitchcock films as Blow—Up and a reference
to the curtain crisis from Cobweb, a movie

Low Laughs & Low Life

about a mental institution that incidentally
was written by VVilliam Gibson who inci-
dentally wrote Twofor the Seesaw which inci-
dentally made a star of Anne Bancroft who
is incidentally Mrs. Mel Brooks.

One of the most annoying faults of High
Anxiety (aside from listening to people
around you proclaim the Hitchcock movie
now being parodied) is its total lack of sus-
pense. Of what value is a Hitchcock tribute
without suspense? We know everything
there is to know about the hospital and its
madmen far too early; getting to the end
isn’t even half the fun. Some inventive mo-
ments like the use of strange camera angles
are repeated so often that their impact dis-
integrates before our eyes.

Another major problem is Brooks himself
in the lead. He’s not a particularly sym-
pathetic man (as \Voody Allen innately is)
and he can’t project, on screen, the charisma
he displays off screen. His Thorndyke is
never really part ofthe action; we keep wait-
ing for him to call “cut.” Also Madeline
Kahn, trying to be a cool blonde a la Grace
Kelly and Tippi Hedren, is simply miscast
and unattractive. Cloris Leachman and
Harvey Korman as a sadistic couple are fine
— if you like that sortofthing.

There’s a popular story about Brooks,
that he goes to theatres where his movies are
playing and counts the laughs. He’s looking
for the pinnacle — where it’s all one big
laugh. He comes close to it in High Anxiety,
but the laughs are cheap. He might do well
to remember that even in comedy, silence
can occasionally be golden.

SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, starring John
Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorney; written

by Norman Wexler (based on a story by Nik
Cohn), directed byjohn Badham.

At long last. Someone has ﬁnally made a
rock and roll movie with all the excitement
of the music and dancing, but without the
cloying condescension and moribund moral-
ity.

The music, most ofit written and sung by
rock’s British castrati, the Bee Gees, has a
raw narrative intensity unlike the group’s
usually insipid hits.We have Robert Stig-
wood to thank for much of this movie —— he

produced it, and the music is released on his

RSO label, and it’s the first time I’m forced
to admit the wily entrepreneur may have
taste after all. It was Stigwood, remember,
who perpetrated, with director Ken Russell,
the abomination of Tommy. _

john Travolta, (nicknamed by some of us
john Revolting for his Barbarino character
on TV’s Welcome Back, Kotter) -is no less than
ﬂawless in his first big screen starring role.
He plays Tony Manero, king ofthe discos, a
narcissistic young man full of ignorance but
little bliss who marks time all week in a
humdrum job and suffocating family until,
one night a week, he reigns on the dance

. floor. Tony is prodded gradually into realiz-

ing a better life exists, an awakening
speeded by his brother, who leaves the
priesthood, and a young woman (Karen
Lynn Gorney) who is trying to better herself
with a job and apartment in Manhattan.
She even tries to clean up her Brooklyn ac-
cent.

Bay Ridge, an all-white section of Brook-
lyn, is the background, an area whose in-
habitants, like Tony, seem well enough off
— no rats in the alleys here — but can’t get
out of the lower middle class vise. The
realistic street scenes are in vivid contrast to
the almost ethereal disco scenes, where the
dancers appear suspended in clouds. mov-
ing in perfect rhythm with each other, while

 

outside, in cars, there is casual grasping sex
without tenderness.

There is no affection anywhere in this
film. Tony is abused by his family, exploited
by his job, and in turn he abuses women
with casual, easy arrogance. They don’t
seem to mind.

Director Badham has a hit and a near
miss to his credit: the excellent TV film The
Law, and the pleasant but ineffectual movie,
The Bingo Long Traveling All Stars and Motor
Kings. In Saturday Night Fever Badham saun-
ters confidently across a tightrope — very
few directors could combine a gang bang, a
gang fight, and modern, Macho Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers falling-in-love-
while-dancing sequence in the same movie

. and make it all believable. Until the
end, which isn’t very believable, but by then
I— was so transfixed I didn’t care about
reality. ’

The script, by Norman Wexler (who
wrotejoe and Serpieo) is tough and gritty, but
some of the characters are all too familiar,
especially the desperate young man search-
ing for someone to tell him not to marry the
girl he got pregnant. He has “Doomed”
written all over him.

Another scene, although nicely played,
has Travolta extolling the particulars of the
V errazano Bridge to Gorney. Perhaps it’s
supposed to prove that even an ignorant
street kid knows a lot about something. The
bridge, of course, is a Symbol.

But none of the film’s several faults matter
that much; what will be remembered about
this one is Travolta/1.,He plumbs the same
violent sexual undercurrents as Marlon
Brando playing Stanley Kowalski; at any
minute Travolta could explode and take ev-
erything with him. He’s dynamite — look-
ing for a match.

The kid is a real star. And just when we

needed one, too.

where in Middle America. He played in
Louisville Gardens recently, bringing with
him one of the best bands I have ever heard.

The show began on time, with no opener.
During the course of about two hours, a
fairly complete inventory of Zappa madness
and brilliance was heard through a sound
system that is advertised as being “very loud
. - . also very clear.” It is. As sports caverns
go, the Gardens is small and acoustically
better- than some. In this setting, the
ampliﬁcation was absolutely perfect, dazzl-
ingly clear.

All the players were super. Terry Bozzio’s
athletic drum solo was fantastic and his oc-
casional vocal leads were straight-ahead
rock like it’s meant to be sung. Rhythm
guitarist Adrian Belew also has a fine and
versatile voice. His Bob Dylan imitation was
hilarious and his rock "guitar solo, a joy to
hear. To mention only these two, however,
is arbitrary. There are simply no weaknesses
in this band. Still, as good as they all were,
when Zappa took off on guitar, it was as-if
no one else was there. If he is not the
greatest living guitarist, then somebody bet-
ter tell him, because he sure as hell.plays like
he is.

The show was well received by an un-
usual audience, by contemporary rock stan-
dards. The crowd was older, and people
were less sullen, less drunk, and more atten-
tive than is usual at these things. In the beer
line, one heard talk about Chick Corea and
Stanley Clarke. This was clearly not your
standard Kiss crowd, and it was awfully
nice to see an old time rock audience get off.

I’ve seen Zappa three times, over a span
of IO years: once in Manhattan; again at

Madison, \/Visconsin; then in Lexington. He ,

hasn’t changed all that much. The music is
tighter, less discursive, but there are impor-
tant communalities, the most important
 humor. He is just so damn funny, to-
tally irreverent, scatological most of the
time, but witty. He punctures the various
balloons of rock and pop culture without
mercy and with skill that is in the finest tra-
dition of the wise fool.

And there is wisdom here, of a sort, in-
sight into our culture and its inherent ab-
surdities (e.g., “I’m goin’ to the Love-In,
gonna sit and play my bongos in the dirt”).
There is also surprising sensitivity. Years
ago, the old Life Alagazine devoted an issue
to rock music with long articles on the Bea-
tles and other major bands. Included was an
appreciation of jimi Hendrix which was a
moving and very fine piece of writing. Out of
that whole issue, it is the only thing I really
remember, and Frank Zappa wrote it. This
is a complicated man.

 

Febmag, 1973

V\’hen you get right down to it, Zappa has
always parodied the conceits and man-
nerisms of rock music while playing the stuff
better than just about anybody, pushing it
far beyond its usual limits. That, I submit, is
no mean achievement, and with his current
band, he is travelling around the country
doing it better than ever before. I don’t care
if he never gets on the radio, he is still one of
the greatest talents in the history of popular
music. If the word “genius” were not so
overused as to have lost its meaning, it

would apply here. - J C

Earth, Wind 6'9’ Fire, Riverfront Coliseum, Cin-
cinnati.

Earth, Wind and Fire opened their 1977
tour at Cincinnati’s Riverfront Coliseum to
a surprisingly sparse house. Perhaps Rod
Stewart’s appearance the night before had
an effect on the gate. No matter. This year’s
version of the Earth, Wind and Fire ex-
travaganza is a feast for eye and ear that will
sell out many, many halls before the tour is
over.

' The opener at Cincinngi was a funk band
called Pocket who have the “distinction” of
being from Baltimore, Maryland. They
played a brief, forgettable set and were fol-
lowed by Deniece Williams, whose torchy
love songs filled the cavernous hall, bringing
cries of appreciation from the largely black
audience. She’d be devastating in a cabaret.

"The headliners took the stage around
10:30, and their entry was spectacular.
F irebombs exploded as nine huge silver cyl-
inders descended from the ceiling onto the
stage. A troop of people in quasi-Egyptian-
looking spacesuits marched around. It
wasn’t really clear just what the spacemen
were supposed to be doing, standing there
around the cylinders, when, all of a sudden,
the stagelights dimmed and the cylinders lit
up to reveal the band members in red satin
capes  The noise in the hall was abso-
lutely deafening. These were Thegcylin-
ders rose again, and as capes were tossed
aside, the music started and went pretty
much nonstop for two hours.

The playing was professional and tight,

and the show was fast-paced with superb ‘

solos just long enough to be appreciated.
They used a variety of show biz gimmicks
with humor and pizzazpz. Audience participa-
tion bits which, in less skilled hands, are an
embarrassing flop, Earth, Wind and Fire

pulled off with style. At one point, in fact,

Maurice White had to urge the audience to
pace themselves- These are showmen in the
best sense of the word. They used their two

lead singers with such perfect balance that -

the crowd response just kept rising in inten-
sity as they traded leads. Phil Bailey’s falsetto

is simply amazing — there’s no other word.-

He takes an audience apart.

The show ended as it began, with a super
visual display. The Egyptian spacemen re-
turned as a silver pyramid descended onto
the stage. It came to rest on a “table” that
appeared to be open underneath. The
players went ‘through a door into ~the
pyramid, one by one, each to a roaring ova-
tion. The  then began to ascend. I won-
dered how they were faring, all squashed to-

~ gether in there, when, presto! F irebombs

went off and the pyramid burst open, empty.
Remember the spacemen? Right. They took
off their helmets and they were the band. I’ll
be danmed ifI can ﬁgure out how theydid it.
I’m tempted to write that it was an amazing
sleight of band, but that would be tacky.

Fire have put together a thoroughly enjoy-
able show, musically and visually. I'm glad I
was there at the send-off. J_c_~_
