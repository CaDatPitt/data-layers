When the devastating earthquake
and tsunami rocked the island na-
tion of Japan earlier this month,
Pitt junior Ken Nakajima fervently
watched the news for the next two
days.

“When I was watching, I was
getting really depressed about the
whole situation to the point where I
almostbecame apathetic to it. It was

like, ‘What’s the point of watching I

the news? What’s the point of car-
ing if I can’t even do anythingpabout
it‘?”’ he said.

But like an increasing number of
Pitt students and groups, Nakajima
decided to act. As a member of the
leadership board of Pitt Asian Inter-
Varsity, a Christian organization on
campus, he began plarminga paper-
crane-folding event on campus to
raise money for earthquake victims
injapan.

The 8.9-magnitude earthquake
struckjapan over Pitt’s spring break.
The initial quake, ensuing tsunami
and more than 100 aftershocks
damaged]apan’s northeastern coast,
including a nuclear plant at Fuku-
shima Daiichi. Several thousand
people have died in the disaster, and
a variety of groups — from the U.S.
government to Pitt students -— have
begun relief efforts.

Such grassroots charitable initia-
tives are critical for the relief effort
injapan, said BrendaJordan,Japan
studies coordinator with Pitt’s Asian
Studies Center.

As an institution, Pitt has mostly
encouraged students to donate in-
dividually to relief charities. This
differs from Pitt’s response to the
earthquake in Haiti, when the Uni-
versity collected supplies.

Some Pitt students have said they
weren’t aware of the University’s re-
lief efforts.

“I haven’t heard of anything Pitt

was doing,” said Pitt sophomore Brie
Latimore, who volunteered for the
Red Cross in high school. “I’m will-
ing to volunteer.”

Students reach out

For the paper-crane-folding
event, the Asian InterVarsity group
will havestudents write their wishes
on pieces of paper that will be folded
into cranes and hung on display in
the William Pitt Union.

'4 Japanese tradition says that a
wish will come true if the wisher
folds 1,000 paper cranes. A

The group is asking for a $1 dona-
tion for each piece of paper and will
have stations on the ground ﬂoor
of the William Pitt Union and near
Einstein Bros. in Posvar today. The
group will be back with the drive
next week, with stations set up
Wednesday through Friday.

Nakajima said that they would

like to get as many cranes as they

Pitt students fundraise forlapan relief

can — hopeﬁilly 1,000.

“[The cranes] will serve as a re-
minder for people, and also it’ll serve
as a symbol that students took initia-
tive and that the students actually
care about this,” Nakajima said.

Aya Okada, a Pit graduate stu-
dent studying international develop-
ment, held a tea fundraiser with her
charitable group, Purposeful Penny,
yesterday in Posvar Hall.

Okada, along with four other
students, founded the organiza-
tion in 2009 with the idea that spare
change, when added up, can make
a difference.

“As students, we can’t do massive
donations,”.Okada said. ,

, The group has previously raised
money for children’s education in
Uganda. Yesterday’s event was origi-

nally planned to beneﬁt Uganda, but -

plan for

Oakland's  

future

Philip Bombara
Staﬁ” Writer

The OPDC wants to make Oak-
land a better place.

A crowd of nearly 250 people
gathered last night in the Saint
Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathe-
dral on Dithridge

Street for the kick-off of the
OPDC, or Oakland Planning and
Development Corporation event
Oakland 2025.

‘ OPDC focuses on community
improvement through involve-
ment —— that is, developing a
community strategy to make
Oakland a better place in the
future — a purpose that is evi-
dentin the objective of Oakland
2025.

OPDC.will organize what it
calls a dialogue—to-change pro-
cess — a series of small group
discussions with the intention
of hearing from all the many dif-
ferent interest groups of the Oak-
land community — to lay out the
issues Oakland residents face.

Speaking to the crowded
room, OPDC executive director
Wanda Wilson said that a col-
lective course for the future was
the paramount interest of this
process.

“We want all the many diverse
voices of Oakland heard, reach-
ing all facets of Oakland. We will
be focusing on things dealing
from physical improvements, to
economic improvements as well,” -
Wilson said in her speech. “We
have been working in unison with
a" lot of the community—based or-
ganizations to really coordinate
our efforts and make sure we are
all on the same page.”

State Rep. Dan Frankel, D-
Pittsburgh, said that the inter-
ests of Oakland have not gone

“Some of you may not know and be sur-

said. .

It was stressed multiple times through-
out the meeting that OPDC wants to hear

Oakland into a community.

Pitt sends 350 letters to legislators

Gwenn’ Barney’
Senior Staff Writer

State legislatures are going to get a lot of
mail in the next few days.

The letter—writing campaign organized
by the'Student Government Board and the
Graduate and Professional Student Assembly
collected more than 350 letters this week,
leading its organizers to call the campaign
a success. V ' — _ _

Student groups organized the event after
Corbett announced his ﬁrst budget proposal
on March 8, which would cut $900 million
in education spending. This would reduce
Pitt’s $185 million state appropriation by
about half, to $80.2 million. State legislators
will hold hearings on the budget throughout
April before setting a date to vote on it. The
University received $7 million in federal
stimulus funding which ends this year, con-
tributing to the drop.

All the letters written by students, fac-
ulty and administrators asked Pennsylva-
nia legislators to vote against the proposed
reduction in Pitt’s state appropriations.
The majority of the letters were written as
part of a letter-writing campaign kick-off,
which took place ‘in the William Pitt Union
on Wednesday.

GPSA president Nila Devanath said she
was pleasantly surprised by the number of

letters written.

“I wasn’t really sure how many students
to expect,” Devanath said. “I was thinking
‘if we get 60 people, I’ll be happy?” V

SGB president Molly Stieber estimated
that the student organizations have collected
more than 350 letters so far.

Some people would visit the letter-writ-
ing campaign’s headquarters in the Union’s

Lower Lounge to pick up supplies and bring _

N ila Devanath:

  
  

them to an entire office or classroom to in-
crease the number of letters written.

The success of Wednesday’s letter—writ-
ing efforts has student leaders consider-
ing the possibility of weekly letter—writing
events in- the Union beginning next week
and continuing on for the remainder of the
semester.

“I think when you have a consistent day
of the week, students can say, ‘I couldn’t
come this week, but maybe I can come next
week.”’ Stieber said.

She also acknowledged that letter—writ-
ing will become even _more important after
Pitt Day in Harrisburg April 5, when it will

become more of a reinforcement tool.

Students who have written or plan to
write letters are including descriptions of
how the budget cuts might negatively impact
them on a personal level or the University
population on a larger scale.

- Sophomore Olivia Armstrong plans to
include in her letter concerns about a pos-
sible increase in tuition for Pitt’s rehabilita-
tion science program. “My program brought
me to Pitt and I would hate for it to be what
drove me away because it’s too expensive,”
she said.

Though Bethany Ground won’t return to
Pitt next year after she graduates, the senior
plans to write to state officials on behalf of
students who will be at the University for
years to come.

“Cutting funding means less money for
scholarships and increased tuition,” she
said. “There shouldn’t be those obstacles
for people.”

Students who missed the opportunity
to write a letter Wednesday can still inde-
pendently turn in letters to the SGB oflice
to have them sent to Harrisburg.

SGB and GPSA have two more major
events planned in addition to the possibil-
ity of a second letter-writing campaign. On
March 30, the two groups will stage a rally
on the Union Lawn at noon, and on April 5,
studentswill travel to the state capital for
Pitt Day in Harrisburg, where they will lobby
legislators on the issue. i

Students drive Japan relief

Japan 4 1

The group had tea samples from Japan,
China and Russia. The members brewedJapa—
nese matcha tea in the traditional fashion: The
tea powder was mixed with hot water using a
small wooden stick, called a chasen.

Okada said the group hoped to raise $300,
but ended up with $835, which far exceeded
their hopes. a

University relief efforts
After the earthquake that struck Haiti in

January of 2010, Pitt worked with the local
charity Brother’s Brother to collect donated

hygiene products for Victims. Donated sup- .

plies were collected in 5—gal1on buckets placed
around the campus as part of Pitt’s Bucket
Brigade for Haiti. V

Because of the buckets’ presence, Pitt stu-
dents were more aware of University efforts.
This time, the situation is different, Jordan
said.

Unlike the in Haiti, in which the 2010
earthquake primarily damaged the capital city,
Port—au-Prince, and some surrounding areas,
cities and towns all along] apan’s northeastern
coast were damaged.

' This makes the damage much more wide-
spread and relief efforts much more difficult.
Japan already has necessary supplies such as.

water and food — funding to move the materi-
als is what’s urgently needed.

“We can’t collect blankets forjapan be-
cause, by the time you ship them toJapan, we
could’ve sent money and they could’ve bought
blankets,” Jordan said.

Jordan said the Asian Studies Center has

— been working with Pitt students, Brother’s

Brother, and the Japan-America Society of
Pennsylvania to put on a beneﬁt concert,
plannedfor April 23 at Belleﬁeld Hall. The
suggested donation for tickets is $5 for stu-
dents and $10 for the general public. Proceeds
will go to Brother’s Brother. ' .

The concert will feature a variety of jazz,
classical and other styles of music. Most of the
performers will be Pitt graduates or current
Pitt graduate students. Local jazz guitaristjoe
Negri will also perform.

The concert was the idea ofYuko Eguchi, a
graduate student in Pitt’s music department.
Eguchi, who is from Tokyo, said she broke
into tears after watching the coverage on the
earthquake. .

Eguchi said that when she was young, her
parents used to play the song “We Are the
World” for her. It taught her an important
lesson. ‘

‘fl learned that the music has a power to
unite and connect‘ people together, especially

Eguchi plays the shamisen, a Japanese
three—stringed instrument with a long neck.
She plans to perform at the event.

“We are doing this for the victims in Ja-
pan, but at the same time we’re doing it for
the community here,” she said, noting that
some members of the Japanese community
in Pittsburgh have been saddened by the fact
that they feel there’s little they can do to help
victims.‘

If students can’t attend the concert, Jordan
encouraged donating to Brother’s Brother.

The organization has raised about,$145,000
for Japan so far and sends all donations to
Japanese relief efforts, said Karen Dempsey,
vice president of Brother’s Brother. .

The fact that Japan has the third largest
economy in the world has hampered providing
aid in one sense, Dempsey said.

Brother’s Brother has worked with Haiti for
more than 40 years; however, the organization
and many other charities aren’t as established
inJapan because it is awealthier nation.

Still, even after the chaotic aftermath set-
tles, the country will still need help.

“InJapan, it will be rebuilding things, and
they’ll need a lot of help in the reconstruction
phase,” Dempsey said. I

To the Editor,

Dread spread of ’90s sweaters

Kaback .4 4

Kudos to Oliver Bateman for his column concerning integrating our
universities with the prison system to save money and streamline
bureaucracy. In the midst of pushing for satire, he instead made a
legitimate argument. ‘

For example, at New York’s Bard College, they have a prison
initiative, which saves inmates Bard’s $50,000 per—year tuition
and provides them with degrees so that they can lead productive
lives in society. Bard claims that college—in-prison! programs have
cut reincarcerationrates from 60 percent to about 15 percent, but
unfortunately most [programs] around the nation have been cut."

Providing a prisoner with an educationsaves the state much more
money in the long run, considering an inmate’s room and board
costs. That’s progress. ’ .

Bateman argues that Pennsylvania should raise taxes to com-

pensate for budget cuts. Chancellor Mark Nordenberg has sa-id that‘

he’d like tuition increases to stay at aminimum too. Yet even with
a larger-than-expected endowment during better economic condi-
tions, no one at Pitt _has ever preventedtuition increases. According
to Pitt’s financial statements, the University took in $1.8 billion last
year and carried an $88 million surplus. Even with the cuts, such
levels would keep‘ the University in the black next year.

, Contrary to popular belief here, the sky isn’t falling. But with the
fictional justiﬁcation that we’re struggling, next year’s tuition will go
up just because it can. Rather than point ﬁngers at legislators, perhaps
it’s time to take a look at what our own administration is doing.‘

APPLICATIONS FROM ALL MAJORS WELCOME 2  :5 i
Deadline: Friday, April 1, 2011

We need to put a stop to the spread
of hipsterism. If a bunch of Russians

wanting to share things scared people_

into making nuclear bombs, imagine
what people will do when they land
in Europe to ﬁnd ﬂarmel and TOMS!
So this is my call to action, a call to
patriotism, to keep the hipster in
America. Imagine if the band that’s
cool because nobody knows about
them suddenly becomes known in
Europe! What happens when Good-
will suddenly needs to start selling
our thrown-out clothes overseas?
What would we wear?

It’s not that I’m against being a
hipster —’ I’m against hipster leav-
ing America. It’s up to us to keep
this thing from going international.
The kings of irony, the people that
‘couldn’t care less about their style
getting popular, have ironically gone

worldwide. I don’t know if I should"

I congratulate a hipster or take a new
proﬁle picture that includes some
form of sepia toning, but I do know
that I want to keep the beanies in
America. Then again, I might just
be behind the trends.

Festival brings Latin American culture to the forefront

The 31st Annual Latin American and Caribbean Festival looks to engage Pittsburgh’s growing Hispanic population

31st Annual Latin American
and Caribbean Festival
William Pitt Union

Saturday, noon-midnight
Hosted by the Center for Latin
American Studies
http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/
index.html ‘

For many Pitt students, con-
ceptions of Latin America and
the Caribbean are gleaned from
movies, television and maybe the
odd trip to Taco Bell or Chili’s.
But as Pittsburgh’s population of
Latinos increases, the Center for
Latin American Studies believes
a more thorough understanding
is in order.

This weekend, CLAS, along
with co-sponsors “the Latin
American Cultural Union and

Med Health Services 8: Pitts-
burgh Cardiovascular Institute,
will sponsor the 31st Annual
Latin American and Caribbean
Festival on the main floor of the
William Pitt Union.

The event, which runs from
noon to midnight, will showcase
a variety of different Latin Amer-
ican and Caribbean customs and
traditions — from music to foods
and crafts — alongside a variety
of interactive programs, includ-
ing activities for children_and
dancing after 9 p.m.

, Although the event is held
on Pitt’s campus, it isn’tjus.t for
students, according to CLAS di-
rector Kathleen DeWalt. In the
past, community members have
composed a large percentage of
attendees.

“We believe that it’s the larg-

est celebration of Latin culture in .

this region on an annual basis,”
DeWalt said. “We have estimated

thenumber of people attending
over the past couple of years has
been more than 2,000, which in-
cludes a number of our students,
but also a lot of people from the
community.”

Aside from being a means
for students and community
members to learn about Latin
American and Caribbean cus-

toms, the festival organizers,

hope the event can serve as a way
for CLAS students to hone their
expertise in a fun and relaxed
atmosphere.

“We have a lot of student vol-
unteers, and this is one of the few
times they get to interact with
people in the community,” CLAS
assistant director for outreach
Karen Goldman said. “Spanish
majors or Portuguese students
get the chance to use those lan-
guages in a really more authentic
setting.”

_ In-Pittsburgh, such authentic

 

 

experiences are hard to come by:
The city has a strikingly small
Latino population. Although the
national average is around 15
percent, the percentage of Lati-
nos in Pittsburgh is only around
2 percent, according to Laura
Macia, a doctoral candidate in
the anthropology department.
Macia has been studying
Latin American culture in the
United States and believes that

Pittsburgh’s numbers provide‘

an interesting foil to other Latin
American populations.

“Until recently, a compara-
tively high number of Latinos
that came to Pittsburgh were
from places that you don’t typi-
cally find elsewhere in such
big numbers, like [from] South
America,” Macia said. “It was
a highly educated population,
which is kind of different from
what you’d usually think. Most
of these were doctors or grad

 

students that came to the region
and stayed.” ’
Macia believes that recently
Pittsburgh hasseen a surge of
more blue-collar, service-ori-
ented immigrants from Central
America and Mexico, but the ear-
lier population is still around.
As such, this weekend’s fes-
tival will reflect the varying

. populations of Latin American

and Caribbean communities

in Pittsburgh. However, unlike

other types of presentations

‘ throughout the year, this festi-

val is more a reﬂectionof pure
Latin American culture than of
Latino culture, a more hybrid-
ized culture reﬂecting both Latin
and U.S. traditions.

“This is not a Latino festival,
so if you come you would see
more of a presentation of tra-
ditional dance than you would,
for example, Cuban hip-hop,”
DeWalt said.

FASHION COLUMN

 

Girmai: NYC a fashion capital

Bethie Girmai
Columnist

If you’ve ever read “Eat Pray Love,” I’m sure
you’re familiar with the notion that every
city has one perfect adjective that encapsu-
lates its personality. Well, I believe the same
is true of every city’s style. My recent trip to
New York reaffirmed this belief.

There are few places worldwide that I
consider to be fashionepicenters. Although
Europe has Paris, Milan and London, the
United States only has one: The Big Apple.

New York City seerns to be overpopulated
with, amongother pﬁsonality types, the
stylish, the powerﬁill-‘and the determined.
So when I began to coisider what its word
might be, I dismissed"-anything that might
set limits on the city.In “Eat Pray Love,”
author Elizabeth"Gill5”ért named it ambi-
tion. I’ve decided to name the city’s lifestyle
“drive.”

My own reasons for visiting the city
related directly to the word in question:
I had interviews for summer internships
at two high—proﬁle magazines. I spent an
inconceivable amount of time preparing
for something that lasted only a few min-
utes, but the experience was eye—opening
and offered me a behind-the-scenes look
at the industry I sodesperately want to be
apartof. g, .   1' V . I

I ended up wearing a silk purple skirt, a
sleeveless black sweater and a green velvet
blazer paired with black tights and patent
leather heels. That’s why I love the fashion
industry: Had I been interviewing anywhere
else, chances are that outﬁt would have been
unacceptable. Too short, too much color, too
much everything. But as Iwould soon come

' to witness, New Yorkers don’t let the office

dress code stifle their senses of style. ’

On the sidewalks, in the parks and even
in the building I visited, style was every-
where. I was surrounded by an abundance of
thigh—high boots, statement necklaces and
bags that, before that moment, I thought
were urban fashion myths. Even in the café
where I lunched, there were businesswomen

in svelte suits and 4-inch heels, and just

I’ about everyone donned a Burberry trench.

At ﬁrst glance, I might have said the power-
hungry political hopefuls in D.C., where I’m
from, dressed the same way. But New York-
ers were different. Their suits had ﬂair and

1 didn’t come exclusively in shades of gray
A and black, and they were unapologetic in

allowing their personal styles to creep into

their professional wardrobes. As a result,

they carried themselves extraordinarily. It
was obvious that they were not only com-
fortable in what they were wearing, but also
took pride in it.

,_.There weretwoi more importantlacces- ,
sories that almosteveryone seemed to be
wearing. 5The,s‘e were subtler than  rest, ,

 and}l»Vl:\70i,ild.;'rfil1atchg witlfeverything in your
l:wardrobe._'They’-were resilience and de-

termination.’ by ‘  A g

In my experience, people are quick to
judge the fashion industry as superﬁcial
and ﬁnicky. But if I learned anything on
my trip, it’sthat the fashion industry is
anything but. The women I saw walking
through those halls walked with purpose.
Most were young, and they didn’t try to hide

' their self—assuredness. It was clear that they

had all worked to get to where they were,

 and_»it didn’t come easily.
' "'-_l ‘Even justat a glance, their virtues ——

conﬁdence, motivation, aspiration and
inspiration — were as visible as scars. But
none of these women wanted to cover them
up," minimize them or erase them from view.

_Instead, they wore the scars of their am-

bition with pride, as testaments to their
hard work and continued dedication to their
passion. ' . '

New’ York is a place seemingly in con-
stant growth. Its people, companies and

style are always moving forward, and its .

fashion exempliﬁes that growth. After all,
New Yorkers are always taking risks and
pushing boundaries. So the next time you
get dressed for an interview — or even for
a night out -— take your cues from the Big
Apple and don’t leave the house without your

Panthers ready for BigEast play

Dustin Gabler

Despite some tough losses against
nonconference teams, Pitt baseball

head coach Joe Jordano said he be- —

lieves that the Panthers learned from
the defeats and are ready to compete

East Championship. .

“ The Big East is ﬁlled with talent
this season with a lot of teams com-
peting-for the title, butjordano said a
challenging nonconference schedule
helped prepare the Panthers for the
season’s next phase. The Panthers
enter their ﬁrst series in conference
play with a nonconference record of
12-6.

“Ithas been the most competitive

Jordano said. “I am conﬁdent we will

Jordano said the Panthers need

W to ﬁnish at the top of the conference

standings.

“We have not played a complete

“Our goal every year is to win the

Baseball seasons predictable

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

Ah, it’s spring again — which means another
glorious baseball seasonand the many sen-
sory experiences that go with it: the crack
of wood on rawhide, the sweet smell of pine
tar and the ever-familiar sight of the Pirates
at the bottom of the standings. With no sal-
ary cap and pay—disparities between players
that are unheard of in hockey or football,

- America’s pastime is fairly easy to predict‘.

So Iwill give you a date-by—date rundown of
completely made up scenarios that I think
could happen this summer in the world of
Major League Baseball.

March 28 — Pitcher Mark Prior injures
his arm and is out forthe season. ‘

April 11 — Derek Jeter tears his ACL
walking up the steps to his mansion. Hank
Steinbrenner: “Jeter needs more focus 

especially when walking up stairs. He should

also get rid of his mansion.”
May 16 —— Pittsburgh Pirates mathemati-
callyl eliminated from postseason.

- June 6 — Heralded super—prospect Bryce
Harper makes his debut for the injury—rid-
dled Washington Nationals after tearing
up the minors. Giants’ closer Brian Wilson
beans him in the head in his ﬁrst at-bat, a
ninth inning pinch—hit, and then proceeds
to charge the batter’s box. After thefracas
is resolved, Wilson apologizes, stating that
because’ Harper was wearing so much eye
black, he mistook him for “some sort of
demon-ninja.” Harper responds by saying
he will cease wearing the eye black imme-

. diately. ' ' . ~

July 1-4 —— The Philadelphia Phillies
throw three consecutive no—hitters against
the Toronto Blue Jays. Roy Halladay, Cliff
Lee and Cole Hamels combine for only ﬁve
walks and 33 strikeouts. Roy Oswalt ruins
the festivities by giving up aahome run on
his ﬁrst pitch to the Florida Marlins in the

next game, before settling down and pitch- .
ing a complete—game two-hitter. General _

Manager Rubén Armaro Jr. states that he’s
“disappointed. We expected this when we
put this rotation together, but Roy couldn’t
hold up his end of the deal. A home run?
Really, Oswalt?” x A

July 30 — The Pirates trade Andrew Mc-
Cutchen, José Tabata and Pedro Alvarez to
the Boston Red Sox for an MLB—record 14
minor league players and 15 players to be
named later. General Manager Neal Hun-

‘tington gushes about how “excited” he is

and continually throws out words like “po—
tential” and “rebuilding.” Ryan Doumit, a
long-tenured Pirate, mutters an expletive
when he hears the news, then proceeds to
call Red Sox G.M. Theo Epstein, asking him
to please “take me too.”

August 25 — Tampa Bay Ray Manny
Ramirez gets thrown out of a game for run-
ning the bases backwards after a home run
against the Detroit Tigers. The home-plate
umpire ejects Ramirez for showboating,

while Manny contends that running the
bases backwards was “just something I al-
ways wanted to do.” “It’s just Manny being
Manny,” managerJoe Maddon says in a post-
game interview. Meanwhile, the outmatched
Rays continue to keep pace with the Yankees
and the Red Sox. .

September 30 — The Pittsburgh Pirates
are mathematically eliminated from the
postseason. Next year’s postseason.

November" 5 — Alvarez blasts a double
in the bottom of the eighth inning off the
Phillies’ Oswalt, driving in McCutchen from
ﬁrst. Tabata then pinch—runs for Alvarez,
steals third and scores on a sacriﬁce ﬂy for
the only two runs in a 2-1, series-clinching

victory for the Red Sox. Somewhere, Doumit,

weeps.
