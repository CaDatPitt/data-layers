To each guest a: servant. brings a
large basin, sometimes or silver, the
top of which is covered by a. mesh
so. that -the used water cannot be
seen. The guest holds his hands
over the basin, and a servant pours
water from a tall pitcher, also sdme

slender spout. The soap is depos-
ited in a receptacle on top oi! the
basin's neck. It was thus that
water was poured on 'Elijah‘s hands.

saying that, “Every college is a com- '

No. 2_
HERB STEIN ,

No Pitt man is or has received
more na.tion~wide , publicity! than has
Herb «Stein this year. With but
two exceptions that we know of,
Herb has been named on every All-
American team selected this year.
This, in addition to the fact that he
was chosen All-American center by
Walter Oamip last year, ranks him
as one of the. really great centers of
all times. _

It is singular that in recent years
Pitt seems to have had a monopoly
on great centerss. First We had Bob
Peck, who was All-American center
for two years, and who ranked, up
to that time, -as one of the greatest
-centers in the game. Bob’s great-
ness lay in his Wonderful defensive
playing. ‘ - P

Now there are many who claim

that Herb Stein is even a greater
fdefensive player than Bob Peck. Be

.§.l that as it may, there is no doubt

lbut what Herb is the o-utstanding
lcenter of the country: this year. As
a, player, Herb has no real weakness».
Some think that his passing has
{been a. little erratic at times, but
that ~ce_rta.inlY., Can not he held
-against his oﬁensive work in other
WBJYS, such as opening up holes in
...the 1-ine and getting down the ﬁeld
under punts. “Tiny’,’ ‘Maxwell, gives
Herb most of the fcredit for opening
the holes in Sta.te’s line for Colonnn.
to go through for his big gains last
Thanksgiving. '

Herbs real greatness, however, is
as a defensive center. Playing ,3.
roving center position, Herb would
Wander from one end: of the line to
the other, smashing up plays time
after time on either side.‘ His abil-
ity to diagnose the opposing teams
plays, to guess exactly where they
were going, and ‘then to break them
up i has been called uncanny. Pitt
students will long remember his
wonderful work in the State and Sy-
racuse games, especially in the lat-
ter, when the Big Orange lost prac-
tically as much ground from scrim-
mage as it "gained. In the case of
nearly every loss, it, was Herb who
had upset the play.

This is Herbs fourth and last
‘year on the squad team. His first
year was the «S. A. T. 0., one when
Freshmen were allowed «to compete.-.
He jumped in and made the varsity

start, also, he was a.’ star. Last year.
his third year on the team, he was
captain and- made ‘one’  the cgreatest‘
leaders Pitt has ever’  fHerb ‘is;
a born leader and by virtue of’ his
ﬁghting spirit, his p,ersona1ity,.

His loss will notllonly  fen on

the gridiron, , _:but in the University

as a whole. for of the football ﬁeld,
Herb is a. real gentleman and is ex-
tremely popular  the student
body. While Herb is an all-aroumd
athlete, he has never -partaken in
any other varsity branch of sport.
Nevertheless he is active the year
around in school circles. In the
classroom, too, Herb is no slouch.
He is capable of doing excellent
-scholastic work and his grades in
all his subjects. are good. He will
not be able to get his degree from
the School of Economics this year,
however, since his first year was
spent in the School of Dentistry.
In spite of that fact and that his
football days are over,
expects to complete his collegiate
course. .

Herb’s home is in Niles, Ohio, but

other Pitt luminaries, He is a. broth-

and All-American tackle. Herb is a.
member of Phi Delta. 'l‘heta, the
Druids and H55-Kockey.

Pitt Will Go After Point
Good Schedule Also 

The Pitt track team is out to win
the big Press Indoor Meet at the
East End Auditorium this Saturday
afternoon", December 17. The largest
team that will ever have represented
Pitt in this meet has been entered.
The present list of entries include
Capt. Hewitt, Thornton,. M-cBurne‘y,
Frank, Pyle, Shaffer, Brickley, Cor-
bett, Wadkins, Morgester, Kidder,
Riley, Fawcett, Hays, Jimmy Martin,

Laughran, Tom Martin, Murdoch, Ro-
bu-sch, -Johnson, Hopkins, Bruder, Dil-
lie, A. Hearne, and Schroedel. ,While
all of these men may not be in shape
by Saturday to compete, the array
is so great that Captain “Tiny” Hew-
itt is conﬁdent his men will bring back
thepoint’ trophy. . \

While immediate interest is in. the
meet at hand, the team is «eagerly
looking forward to the ‘ﬁnale announce-
ment of the schedule that is being
arranged by Manager Sam Nicholson,
for present indications are that it will
be by long ‘odds the most attractive
program ever undertaken by a Pitt
track team and will embrace more
ﬁne trips than have ever been taken
by any Pitt team. _  v 7

The tentative schedule‘ provides for
a southern trip during Easter vaca-
tion to include the annual dua1*meet
with the Navy at Annapolis and one
other meet not yet arranged for. The
relay team, will be entered again, as
usual, in the Penn Relay's, April 29
and 30. The following Saturday is
the triangular meet at Syracuse be-
tween Pitt, Syracuse and Colgate,
which was won last year by Syracuse
with Pitt second. Saturday, May 13,
will be filled with a dual meet with
the Army at West Point‘.

Our own annual intercollegiate and
intersclrdlastic invitation meet will be
held at Schenley Oval on May 21.
Penn State will be entered in the in-
tercollegiate meet. The ‘following

Icage stars. Since the first Pealntherette

sextet was organized in 1915 all of
the best girls’ teams of Western
Pennsylvania have tried ‘in vain l_.to
score a victory over them. This year
Director of Athletics~C‘har1es 8. Mil-
ler is offering the team .new.ﬁeld's to
conquer, ‘namely, a ~t_ri*p~, involving
games *-with several prominent East-
ern Pennsylvania colleges. An attrac-
tice schedule is being» arranged. A
Two facts shouildwbei pointed out in
connection with girls’ basketball at
Pitt. This is one of the fewschools in
the country to observe the freshman
rules in girls,’ arthletics as well as in
boys’. The. result is that every year
the Pitt freshman girls have a team
which meets the strongest of the high
school teams of the city and vicinity.
Also, there is careful oversight of the
girls on the basketball team ‘by the de-
paftxnent of healpli. Dr. Marian Shep-
ard makes a thorough examination of
every ‘girl before she is permitted to
conioout for“’rthe team and the play-
ers, both ‘varsity and freshman, are
examined before and after every
game. Thus the dangerous element of
girls’ basketball is eliminated.

Due to changes in the curriculum

of the university, Florence Montgom-
ery, caiptain-elect, an ’Anna Ander-
son, star forward, a lost to the
team. Several players of great ability,
including ex-Captain Ethel James,
Blanche Parker, Mary «Chapman,
Betty Dutney, Kit McNamara, Kath-
erine Roehn and Grace Love are can-
didates for this year's team.

Miss McC:len-ahan graduated ‘from
Pitt in 1919.1‘ While in school she
played‘ on the? freshman team in '16
and on the varsity during the sea-
sons of ’17, ’18, ’19. She was one of
the most successful guards in the his.-
tory of the game. After leaving school
she was associated first with the Uni-
versity -of California and San Fran-
cisco Y. W. C. A. and later with
Fifth Avenue High School of this
city, until taking a position at the
university.
