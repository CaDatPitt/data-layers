Faculty Assembly supports N eedleman

By Matt Groff
and John B. Moore
The Pitt News

A letter supporting Pitt professor Herbert
Needleman and criticizing the use of the
Needleman Board Report was distributed at
yesterdays Faculty Assembly meeting.

“[The university] needs to say something
publicly and loud,” Faculty Assembly
President James Holland said. “lNeedlemanl
was put through years of aggravation.”

The letter was presented at the meeting
as a response to the misuse of the
Needleman Board Report by Michael

Van Sertima
spea/es about
contributions
to civilization
by Africans

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

The idea of the earth being round may
seem like an old concept for many people.

However, according to Ivan Van Sertima,
people have only recently realized this idea
originated in Africa.

“We know very little about Africa,” Van
Sertima said. “Its only within the last 25
years that we have been able to know what
Africans are able to do.”

Van Sertima, a professor of African
Studies at Rutgers University, spoke of
Africa’s contributions to civilization last
night in David Lawrence Hall.

According to Van Sertima, aspects of
modern civilization which began in Egypt
and other African nations have largely gone
unnoticed.

“All of this has been circulating and very
few of us pick it up,” Van Sertima said.
“We have people growing up damn stu-
pid.”

“Ancient Egypt had the most profound
impact on science in the world,” he added.

According to Van Sertima, slavery in the
early United States and prejudiced attitudes
in the past led to ignorance of African con-
tributions to civilization.

“How could you believe in God and be

Bikerman, chair of the Senate Community
Relations Committee.

The credibility of Needleman’s 1979
report on the effect of low—level lead expo-
sure on children’s IQ was questioned by the
National institutes of Health which asked
Pitt to investigate the matter. Pitts hearing
board found no evidence of wrongdoing,
but according to the letter, the committee
said it feels that at least one article about
the Needleman Board Report still “implies
that Pitt’s hearing board found
Needleman guilty of violating widely-
accepted research integrity codes.”

According to the letter, Needleman was

misrepresented and therefore discredited as
a proponent of lead abatement policies in
the article.

The letter also charges the lead industry
with “extraordinary efforts" to “enlist scien-
tists and health care professionals in its
efforts to continue making money at the
expense of children’s health."

Needleman, who also conducted research
at Harvard, has been suppoited by a recent
report by the National Academy of
Sciences. ‘

Power

outage
closes
Union

By Steve Komrovich
Asst. News Editor

Burning wires in the
main electrical feed to the
\Villiam Pitt Union caused
it and several other build-
ings to lose power for
parts of Monday and
Tuesday.

The Union, Hillman
Library and the Cathedral
of Learning, among-other
buildings, first lost power
at approximately 9:45
a.m. Monday.

The burning wires
were discovered on
the lower level of the
Union about two hours
after the power out-
age, according to Chris
Weinstein of the Depart-

ment of Facilities
Management.
“It took a while

because the Towers went
down, the bookstore,
Schenley Quad and oth-
ers,” Weinstein said about
the process of isolating
the problem.
Management closed the
lower and main floors of
the Union until the prob-
lem was iso ated, and
then Larry Keller, director
of Health and Safety,
made the decision to
close the entire building,
according to the Union
Building Manager Chris

Chergi.
All buildings except the
Union had power

restored within about a
half hour by the readjust-

Speaker discusses United States‘ involvement with the UN

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

Political Science Professor
Brian Ripley spoke to the
University Democrats about
U.S. involvement in the United
Nations at last night’s meeting in
the William Pitt Union.

“It’s not the most exciting
topic, but anything to get away
from the Whitewater affair,”
Ripley said.

Ripley focused on Clinton’s
foreign policy and then voiced

his own solutions to interna-
tional problems.

“A foreign policy is like archi-
tecture  a mixture of old and
new. If it works out, everyone
calls it a masterpiece. If not,
everyone is disappointed,” he
said.

“Clinton is looking for a poli-
cy that draws from past and pre-
sent. It’s a high-risk policy.”

Ripley focused on some of
the ideas of National Security
Advisor Anthony Lake.

Lake, according to Ripley,

believes we should remain in
world affairs, become involved
in multilateralism and try to
achieve a balance between the
United States and the United
Nations.

“There needs to be a balance
between. U.S. and U.N. issues. If
the U.S. is involved in the U.N.,
then the U.S. must learn when
to say ‘no,”’ he quoted Lake as
saying.

Ripley’s ideas about interna-
tional peacekeeping focused on
long-term solutions.

“Perhaps it is best for the U.N
not to focus on militarization,
but rather on commitment with-
in the U.N. I’m talking in a long-
term sense  I’m interested in
shifting the focus from short
conflict to long-term conflict
prevention,” he said.

UD President Hayes E. Davis
said he was impressed with
Ripley’s speech. ‘

“I thought he gave a very eon-
cise presentation. I think too
often there aren’t any long-
range options expressed --

suchas improving social prob-
lems of different countries,” he
said.

UD Secretary Eric Schultz said
he thought that the U.S.—U.N
issue is one that needs to be
addressed.

“Whenever the U.N tries to
get involved in peacekeeping,
it’s the U.S. that commits the
most troops and is held respon-
sible for what goes on. The U.S.
is the only remaining super-
power, and should be the head,

Greek Week
commences;
raises funds
for Special
Olympics

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

Greek Week, a string of
events committed to helping
the Special Olympics of
Pennsylvania, kicked off last
night with a formal ceremony in
the William ' Pitt Union
Ballroom.

According to Formal Opening
Ceremonies Chairs Jennifer
Scott and Robert Watson, the
event marks a time to strength-
en the bonds between all
Greeks at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Dean Currier, a Theta Chi
brother, agreed with Watson
and Scott.

“It’s good for the Greeks
to do something positive for
the community, and we’re
very excited about contribut-
ing to Greek Week,” Currier
said.

Greek Week overall chair
Cassandra Berarducci was very
excited about the prospects of
Greek Week 1994.

“This occasion is held every
year to acknowledge our chari-
ty, the Special Olympics,”
Berarducci said. She encour-
aged Pitt Greeks to “take advan-
tage of the Greek events and do
as much as you can for the

_ charity.”

The Pennsylvania Special
Olympics are events sponsored
throughout the state for people
with mental and. physical handi-
caps. 5

Goofy clowns, wheelchair decorating,
wacky face painting and bags of toys will
be the order of the day Saturday, ‘March
26. Students participating in the Hand-in-
Hand festival, now in its 16th year, will be
helping hundreds of local handicapped
children.

Hand—in-Hand, a non-profit student
organization associated with the Office of
Resident Life and entirely comprised of
volunteers, annually brings together stu-
dents and disadvantaged youths from var-
ious Allegheny County schools.

Susan Bare, a coordinator of this year’s
event, said this year’s theme will be Circle
of Friends. Barring bad weather, she said
she expects that up to 350 children will
show up for this year’s festival which will
be held on the first ﬂoor of Forbes Quad
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Hand-in-Hand advisor Denine Rocco-
Minteer said, “Circle of Friends is certain-
ly fitting, because once you work so hard
with all the volunteers and spend the day
with the children” everybody becomes
good friends. '

_ 42

People involved in Hand-in-Hand
agreed that the children love the event.
Shannon Kramer, a Hand-in-Hand coor-
dinator, said, “One 16-year—old girl cried
when she had to leave  and made one
student promise to come back the next
year.”

The event has become a rewarding ritu-
al for some of those involved. Bare said,
“Year after year kids realize how much
fun we have  clowns, Pitt cheerleaders,
Pitt athletes and mascots keeps them
coming back.” She said all children
receive t-shirts depicting the year’s
theme, and often children who attend the
festival are wearing shirts from previous
years.

Bare said there will be 45 to 50 booths,
staffed by a myriad of student organiza-
tions, to entertain the children. She said
Greeks, service fraternities and sororities
and many other SGB—recognized organi-
zations will host the booths. And, she
said, at each booth the children will
receive bags of toys.

Another highlight of the day for the
children will be meeting stars from vari-
ous sports, she said. “Pitt athletes usually
come down and sign autographs because

- __.__.’z
Clowns, games scheduled tofill Forbes Quad

a lot of children see them on TV, and
they become role models, so it helps,"
she said.

Kramer said the business fraternity will
sponsor a pie-in-the—face contest.

“They will dress up in plastic and
let kids throw things at them,” she
laughed.

Hand-in-Hand is still accepting applica-
tions for volunteers who would like to
participate in this year’s event, Bare said.
She said students can apply for two posi-
tions: facilitators, requiring CPR training,
or positions with onc—on—one interaction
with the children. Forms can be picked
up at the Towers Main Desk, William Pitt
Union information desk and Sutherland
Hall.

Encouraging students interested in get-
ting involved, she said, “You’ll end up
feeling like you’ve done something spe-
cial for somebody. You laugh too, the
clowns make you laugh.”

Rocco-Minteer summarized the event”

as “a day we can offer something to
the special’ community of children.

. The smiles you see from those children

make all the planning and work worth
it.” ‘

ment of electrical switches and
rerouting of power, Weinstein
said. The Union regained
power at about 8 a.m. Tuesday.
The power outage proved
to be a headache for almost all

of Oakland, where many stu- -

dents, other residents and busi-
nesses lost their electricity for
much of Tuesday while
Duquesne Light repaired the
damaged lines.

"The outage lon Monday] was
related to [Tuesday’sl outages,”
said Dennis O’Neil, Duquesne
Light’s Public Affairs general
manager.

O’Neil said that an interrup— ‘

tion in the power lines had
to occur to ‘complete the
repairs. "

Losing their electricity, many
Pitt students and teachers
were faced with the unusual sit-
uation of holding classes in the
dark.

Junior Ron Halsey said that-
his professor let his class go
early from a dark classroom. He
was unable to give notes to the
class because the overhead pro-
jector was electric.

Those working in the Union
were right in the middle of the
electrical ﬁasco.

Angello Madison, a disc jock-
ey at the campus radio station
WPTS, was on the air right
before the electricity went out
and panicked thinking he did
something wrong. V

“Mondays are usually in disar-
ray,” Madison said.

“I thought I ﬂipped the Wrong
switch.”

Margorie Rhody, who also
works at WPTS, said luckily the
radio station has a lot of win-
dows, not like the‘ bookstore or
David Lawrence Auditorium
which was pitch black.

Rhody said that she; like
many others in the Union, wait-
ed until the campus police
asked everyone to leave the
building at 1 p.m.

racist?” he said. “That’s why [knowledge
of African contributions] is just beginning
.. we’re entering a whole new body of
things.”

Van Sertima pointed to several exam-
ples of scientific and technological devel-

opments which began in Africa long"

before Europe and Asia had heard about
them.

According to Van Sertima, some of
modern medicine’s most important prac-
tices began in Africa.

He said the development of as-

. pirin—type pain killers; medicine for glau-

coma and hypertension, a smallpox vac-
cine and the first successful Caesarian—
section childbirths all had their origins in
Africa. .

“Caesarian sections were being
performed in Africa with 100—percent
success, while in Europe they had al-

most a 100-percent failure,” Van Sertima
said.

“We know nothing about this,” he
added. “We only study the sick people in
Africa, not what it was that made them
sick.” V
Van Sertima also said several key astro-
nomical advances such as the 24-hour
day, planet revolution, stars’ orbits,
expansion of the universe and the con-
ceptof the earth being round began in

Africa long before the Western world

heard of such concepts.

“Centuries later people were [arguing],
‘Is the earth round? Is the earth flat?” Van
Sertima said.

Some religious customs that spread
throughout the world also originated in
Africa, according to Van Sertima.

“The Jews, who were largely black at
one time, adopted circumcision from the
Egyptians,” he said.

Van Sertima also said Western anthro-
pologists who studied ancient Egypt
often misunderstood African physical fea-
tures that did not fit their concept of what
was traditionally African.

“If they found one aspect that looked
European they would say ‘they’re mixed

_lracially],”’ he said. “There was no great

civilization in the world that was entirely
homogeneous.”

Van Sertima said a major key to under-
standing history is understanding that
all people go through good and bad peri-
ods.

“People are people are people 
we’ll never examine history truthfully
unless we understand that,” Van Sertima
said.

“We need to follow what we know,” he
added.

“We know a lot more than we knew
years ago.”

gearing up for events that will benefit children with
handicaps. Although the Pitt student body is often chas-
tised for their apathy, those volunteering their time and
energy to help others should be recognized and praised
for their involvement. ,

Others should follow in the steps of their peers and
offer a few hours of their time for worthy causes. Many
organizations on campus are practically begging for vol-
unteers to help tutor elementary school children, visit
homeless shelters or help handicapped children.

By simply attending an organizational meeting or call-
ing a community—service group listed in the Student
Directory, any student can get involved.

While a summer of total relaxation is always nice, giv-
ing up two hours a week to volunteer can truly make a
difference in a community—service group.

Elected for the people?

The role of any elected politician is to theoretically
serve the interests of the public. It would only be com-
mon sense that politicians at any level would want to
keep their constituents informed of what issues the
politicians were dealing with as well as how they were
voting.

But apparently common sense isn’t regarded highly by
the members of the Plum Borough Council.

An independent contractor offered to air the council
meetings on a Plum Cable television channel at no cost
to the borough. -

While the constituents at the meeting wanted it, the
Council opposed the offer. “We’re not ready for it,” the
mayor of Plum said.

It is difficult to understand what there is to get ready
for. The public deserves to know what their local gov-
ernment is doing on their behalf, especially when it
comes at no cost to them.

The issue in Plum is only indicative of the larger prob-
lem faced with all politicians today.

Many seem to have forgotten they were elected to do
what was best for their area, whether it is a borough
or and entire state, and are accountable to their con-
stituents.

The focus is now on reelection and what the people
don’t know won’t hurt them. Any opportunity for pub-
licity and disbursement of information to the public
should be looked upon favorably by all politicians. If
they’re doing their job there is nothing to fear.

Letters to the Editor

Rabbi offers condolences, hopes for peace
As the Executive Director of the Hillel Foundation for Campus
Jewish Life, serving more than 2,000 students at the University of
Pittsburgh, let me offer sincerest condolences to the families of
the victims of the Hebron massacre and the Palestinian people.
We, the Foundation for Campus Jewish Life, stand by Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in his condemnation of this “loath-

some, criminal act of murder.”

We affirm President Ezer Weizman’s statement that “there is no
understanding, no forgiveness and no atonement for this horri-

ble act.”

.Finally, as spokespeople for the Jewish presence on campus,
we unite with the Jewish people behind the statement of Israeli
Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau: “It is a desecration of God’s name

to connect faith to this incident.”

The perpetrator of the Hebron massacre is a terrorist who in
no way represents the hopes, dreams and ideals of the Jewish

people.

The greatest possible memorial to the victims of this tragedy is

for all parties in the Middle East to intensify their efforts towards

a just and lasting peace.

University needs better athletic facilities

In the article entitled “SGB
discusses football season ticket
increase,” it was stated that “in
comparison to other schools,
students at Pitt pay much less
for athletic maintenance.”
What other schools? And how
much less?

A comparison of Pitt"s athlet-
ric facilities to other schools’
(Penn State and West Virginia
University) by [SGB President]
Ross Pasquale puts it in per-
spective.

It is hard to compete with
schools like West Virginia,
who have training rooms in
nearly all (if not all) of their
residence halls and have an
excellent stadium in which
students get first choice of the
highly-prized 50-yard—line sec-
tion.

It is hard to compete with
schools like West Virginia that
consistently give Pitt a good
football game no matter how
the schools fare during the rest
of the season.

And it is hard to compete
with WVU because students
get charged NO MONEY to
go to the football games

there.

You don’t even need a tick-
et, just your student ID and
something called a PRT card,
which is like a subway pass
(which still costs an extra
nothing). It’s included in the
bill like our campus bus sys-
tem is here.

So is the fee for a decent,-
sized daily paper. And their in-
state tuition is half of what
ours is here.

[SGB member Heath]
Golden was right when he
said, “The administration
should decide carefully if they
want to undertake a project
costing $19.5 million  or put
the money toward things that
would affect the student body
as a whole.”

I like the reputation of Pitt as
a tough athletic school, and I
do respect the determination
of student athletes, but I think
we need better athletic facili-
ties here that can be used by
everyone, and I think that we
need to find out where our
money is being spent.

'scope is a disgrace

Here is an aspect of the Mt.
Graha'm telescope disgrace
that Pitt students should
know. Blacks objected to the
Atlanta Super Bowl being
held under a Georgia flag
that incorporates in its
design of the confederate
flag, a symbol of slavery.
Likewise, it is insensitive of
the University of Arizona and
the people of Safford,
Arizona, a town near the Mt.
Graham observatory, to be
promoting a museum to
commemorate desecration of
a mountain sacred to Apache
Indians. Apaches object to
the planned “Museum of
Discovery.”

The museum’s literature
shows Apaches picking cot-
ton for the Safford descen-
dants of those who took the
land from the Apaches in
1873 without compensation
or their permission. Avstroke
of the pen of Ulysses Grant
dismantled major portions of
the Apache reservation for
the local Anglo farmers and
miners. The museum says it
will be an exaltation of con-
tinued “astronomy discover-

ies” 500 years after
Columbus “discovered”
America.

The Mt. Graham observa-
tory and its museum are an
offensive chapter in the his-
tory of man’s inhumanity to
man. These scientifically mis-
located telescopes must be
dismantled and relocated to
a mountain where they can
accomplish better science.
Then a museum can be built
to commemorate a disman-
tling that would be a truly
historic expression of cultur-
al respect by an Arizona
town, a university and a state
on behalf of its indigenous
inhabitants.

St. John's
bounces
Pitt hoops

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

The Paul Evans Era as Pitt’s
head men’s basketball coach
officially came to an end last
Thursday night at the Big East
Tournament in New York, as
the Panthers lost to St. johns
80-72 in the opening round of
the toumey.

Pitt played without starting
point guard Jerry McCullough
and shooting guard Sotiris
Aggelou. McCullough severely
cut his hand in the last game of
the regular season against Seton
Hall, and the injury required six
stitches.

Tournament officials refused
to allow Aggelou to play,
declaring the protection on his
injured wrist illegal.

The Panthers entered the
tournament seeded eighth with
a 13-13 overall record and a 7-
11 mark in the Big East. St.
John’s earned the ninth seed
with an 11-16 and overall record
and a 5-13 conference record.

NCAA bursts Pitt women's basketball's bubble

Lady Pomt/aers settle for third seed in

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s basketball
team compiled a 19-9 record
this season, the best in head
coach Kirk Bruce’s nine years
running the show.

The Lady Panthers’ chase of
the first NCAA tournament bid
in team history did not come
down to the Big East
Tournament, where a second-
round loss to the 16th-ranked
Seton Hall Pirates (25-4) left Pitt
on the bubble.

The Lady Panthers spent the
climactic moment waiting for a
call from the NCAA that would
never come in a restaurant,
watching the selection show for
the women’s NCAA Tournament
Sunday afternoon.

Small forward Jill Colabrese
turned away and her teammates
watched in disbelief as the final
bids were revealed and Pitt was
left out.

“We were hurting [Sunday],
and that’s the way it is sup-
posed to be,” Bruce said.

“We know we should have
been in. You can’t control what
goes on in that room where
they meet. We still feel that we
are one of the best teams in the
country, and we deserve to be
in that field of 64. It’s going to
take a heck of a lot for someone
to convince us otherwise.”

Bruce said that he found his
bright side Monday morning
with Pitt’s entry into the
National Women’s Invitational
Tournament in Amarillo, Texas.

“The disappointment lat not

being in the NCAA Tourneyl
was severe,” Bruce said. “That
changed for me when I saw
who we were playing in the
NWIT and  that competition
set back in.”

Pitt enters as the third seed in
an eight-team tournament. They
face sixth-seeded Gonzaga (20-
8) out of the West Coast
Conference in the first round
Thursday, March 24 at 4 p.m.

The winner of that game will
play the winner of the game
between second-seeded New
Mexico St. (23-6) and seventh-
seeded Oklahoma (15-12)
March 25, with the champi-
onship game the following day.

The tournament has a losers’
bracket, so each team will play
three games.

Bruce said that the NWIT
could provide some redemption
for the Lady Panthers.

“There’s all kinds of reasons
why you want to win, but we’re
going to keep it real simple,”
Bruce said. “If they are keeping
score, we want to win. If you
are going to keep score, they
are going to have officials and
there’s another team out there, I
want to play.”

Bruce said accepting the
NWIT invitation was an easy
decision.

“That was never a considera-
tion for us,” Bruce said. “Why
wouldn’t we be excited about
playing three more games. [Any
team that would turn the invita-
tion down] just isn’t looking at it
correctly. The worst thing
would be sitting at home and
doing nothing.”

The Panthers entered the Big
East tournament with a chance
to strengthen their case for the
selection committee.

Pitt started as the third seed
playing sixth-seeded Miami (10-
17).

“It was a pressure situation,”
Bruce said. “If you lose that first

game, you go home. For NCAA
purposes, we knew that game
would have hurt us if we lost it.”

Pitt reduced the Hurricanes to
a light breeze for the third time
this season with a 70-60 victory.

Hamilton
leaves Pitt

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

Thomas Hamilton, Pitt’s
seven-foot-four-inch
recruit, has left school
and gone home to
Chicago. Hamilton with-
drew from Pitt last week
in the wake of Panther
head coach Paul Evans’
contract proposal being
pulled off the table.

Hamilton, from Martin
Luther King High School
in Chicago, had been
counted on to be the
starting center for Pitt
next season, replacing
senior Eric Mobley.

The athletic department
had no comment on
Hamilton’s departure, and
Hamilton himself left
town March 7 without a
statement.

Hamilton had come to
Pitt after originally signing
with Illinois. Hamilton
was later denied entrance
to Illinois and transfened
to Pitt where he was sit-
ting out this season as :1
Prop 48 casualty.
Hamilton said he had
chosen to join the
Panthers after being
denied by Illinois because
Evans had been one of
the first to recruit him.

Evans, who is staying in
New York City for the
time being, was quoted in
the Pittsburgh Post-
Gctzette last week as say-
ing that he thought
Hamilton would only play
two years of college ball
before turning profession-
al.

There is no word yet on
where Hamilton is plan-
ning to play basketball
next year.

Pitt men's tennis drops
three of four in Florida

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

Sand, surf,’ golf or whatever
you like to do on spring break
was not on the minds of the
men’s tennis team as they trav-
eled to Florida last week.

.They did get lots of sun, but
they were out practicing and
competing, not sunbathing and
swimming.

Head coach V George
Dieffenbach said the trip was
“very successful.

“We had a good practice

S Saturday, a good run on Sunday

and we did the same thing on
Monday,” he said.

The Panthers kicked off their
week with a strong 7-0 victory
against Bethune—Cookman.
Leading the way for Pitt were
senior co—captains James

, Chronister (6-1, 6~O) and Jeff

Campbell (6-(), 6-0).

Other singles winners were
Braden Doherty (6—O,6—O), Brad
Wade (6—O,6-O), Dave Dumpel
(6—O,6-O) and Matt Mills
(default).

In doubles action, Doherty
and Wade won 8-1, which was
also the winning margin for
Campbell and Chronister. Chris
McShane and Jesse Hyatt won
by default.

The Panther success did not
last. Stetson bested Pitt by the
familiar score of 7~().

The only bright spot for the
blue and gold was an 8-5 victo-
ry by Doherty and Wade.
However this victory did not
score a team point for the
Panthers because of new NCAA
rules this season.

In doubles, three matches are
played and the team which
wins two out of three receives
the one team point. On the sur-

face it may seem that Pitt
got crushed, but in reality
many of the matches were
close.

Matt Mills lost a tough match
6—4,7-5 and Dave Dumpel lost 6-
4, 7-6.

In their next match, the men
took the court against Creighton
University. The final score:
Creighton 6, Pitt 1.

The lone Panther victory
came when Matt Mills defeated
Tom Ratino 6-3, 7-6. Dun1pel
and Wade each lost tough
three-set matches.

“Creighton was a very good
team,” Dieffenbach said. “We
had some close matches and
just didn’t win.”

Pitt’s last match of the week
was a 7-0 trouncing by the
University of Central Florida.
The best showing for the
Panthers was an 8-5 loss in dou-
bles by Doheity and Wade.

“It was very successful,"
Dieffenbach said, recapping the
week. / A

"On Tuesday we defeated
Bethune—Cookman in a good
match We lost to a good team
in Stetson but there were many
close matches. Creighton was a
very good team and so was
Central Florida.

"Everything we are doing
right now is getting us ready to
peak at the conference champi-
onships in April."

AROUND THE NET: The
next home matches for the
Panthers will be Saturday and
Sunday, March 19 and 20.

On Saturday at 1 p.m. Pitt _will
host the Bonnies of St.
l3onaventure, and on Sunday at
10 a.m. Loyola (.Md.) Comes to
town. Both matches will be held
at the Cost Center.

Rovee works behind scenes as assistant gymnastics coach

By Neal Riley

For The Pitt News

He drives the women’s gym-
nastics team van to out-of—state
meets.

He does administrative paper
work in a stuffy office. You
might even see him lugging
around gym equipment.

He’s a busy, behind-the-
scenes man who might not
receive much recognition.

He is Ben Rovee, assistant
coach of the Pitt women’s gym-
nastics team.

Hailing from New Jersey,
Rovee arrived on Pitt’s campus
in 1985 as a walk—on gymnast.
He distinguished himself as an
athlete, becoming captain of the
team and a top_ competitor, MVP
his junior year and stationary
rings champion at the Keystone
State Games and Garden State
Games.

Although he red-shirted his
junior year with a shoulder
injury, Rovee continued to be a
major player in Pitt gymnastics.
After graduating from Pitt with
a B.A. in English Literature,
Rovee went to work with
Debbie Yohman, Pitt’s head
coach of the women’s gymnas-
tics team. .

“I was surprised that I got
hired because I never coached
women before,” Rovee said.
“But it’s worked out  I under-
stand it a lot better [and] I’m
learning every day.”

Apparently it has worked
out — Rovee was voted assis-

tant coach of the year last sea-
son. ‘

Yohman has given Rovee the
responsibility of coaching the
women on bars. As Rovee
describes it, his place at bars is
much like a position coach in
football.

This responsibility means that
Rovee must be with the team at
all times during practice for
physical as well as moral sup-
port.

“Someone can do something
on bars and think they’re doing
it right and not be  so they
constantly need to be coached,”
Rovee said.

Along with technical leader-
ship, a high-performance athlet-
ic team also requires motiva-
tion. Gymnastics is a sport
where unending dedication is
expected, in spite of injuries
and sore muscles.

For Rovee, this is also a part
of coaching.

“One day they can come in
and have a great workout, and
other days  they might be
hurting a little bit, or might not
have gotten a lot of sleep  or
might have a touch of the flu,”
Rovee said.

“That’s when they need moti-
vated.”

But Rovee has been through
all the agonies of college athlet-
ics. He says that he understands
when a member of the team is
having a tough time.

“Some days you take your
body to the gym  and you
don’t want to practice + you

.I'l2lt€

struggle through that stuff,”
Rovee said. “Sometimes it takes
a little more motivation that oth-
ers.”

Together Yohman and Rovee
know how to strike a balance
between pushing the team real
hard and offering a kind word
of encouragement.

“One day if I’m  getting on
the kids real hard, [Yohman] is
there to pick them up. Other
days she’s tough on the team
and I’m there to pick them up,”
Rovee said.

“Then there are those unfortu-
days where both
Debbie and I are tough on the
kids.”

“We work well together  we
keep each other in line,”
Yohman said. “He’s up when
I’m down, and I’m up when
he’s down.”

“Sometimes if you come in

and you’re upset because you

had a bad event, he [RoveeI'
‘always has something to say to

make you want to keep going,”
Pitt gymnast Lori Buck said.

Rovee says that at this point in
the season (working toward
their eighth meet), the team
knows what he expects from
them.

When they come into the gym
for practice, they know how
hard they will have to work,
and if they don’t give Rovee
what he is looking for, then
they know that they will do
more work.

But he says that sometimes
there is that point where an ath-
lete can’t perform.

“Then you say, ‘OK, you’re
done here"  there’s no sense
beating a dead horse,” Rovee
said.

Aside from meeting the typi-

cal commitments of an assistant
coach, Rovee also takes on the
responsibility of promoting the
team.

He writes aperiodic newslet-
ter giving background informa-
tion on the team and its events.
He also does what he can to get
more people to come to the
gymnastics meets. One of
his goals is to break the atten-
dance record at the women’s
meets.

But Rovee’s favorite part of
being assistant coach is working
with the team members.

“I'll say that 99.9% of the gym-
nasts that come through our
program under Debbie and
myself have gotten better by the
time they have graduated,”
Rovee said.

“I get real excited when they
do well. It’s the nextbest thing
to doing it yourself.”

Staff Writer

Despite being snubbed by the
NCAA selection committee, the
Pitt Lady Panthers are on their
way to the NWIT and the best
record (19-9) in coach Kirk
Bruce’s nine-year career at Pitt.

Thanks to a team-wide effort
and the improvement of some
individual players, Pitt captured
third place in the Big East stand-
ings.

All this success is due in no
small amount to shooting guard
Jenine Joyce who has polished

- her game and doubled her

numbers in nearly every statis-
tic.

Joyce’s career at Pitt took an
upward tum when Bruce select-
ed her for the Big East traveling

Ba-sketball-trip to

team that toured Brazil last sum-
mer.

“It could’ve been anyone,”
Bruce said. “I felt it may have
helped her to have that experi-
ence.” .

In Brazil, Joyce played against
top-notch competition every
day.

That trip aided her in discov-
ering more confidence in her
game. But it wasn’t until the
1993-94 season actually began
that she knew her confidence,
like her shot, had retumed.

Joyce popped Loyola for 18
points in early December,
buried Syracuse with a season-
high 26 in January and later lit
up Boston College and Seton
Hall- for 19 points each.

Earlier this season Jonna
Huemrich, the Lady Panthers’

All—Big East performer, said that
she didn’t have to score “a ton
of points every night” like in the
past because some of her team-
mates had stepped up their
game. ’

Joyce is one of those players.

“Jenine has been able to score
in a variety of ways. One of the
best things she does is drive to
her left. She is not just a three-
point jump-shooter,” Bruce
said.

Joyce thinks her most valu-
able asset as a player is not
in one particular area of the
game but rather her ability to
produce in a number of differ-
ent aspects.

Not only is she a top three-
point gun who can drive to the
basket, but she is also adept at
sticking her five-foot-nine-inch

THE PITIT NEWS, Wfednesday, 'March~ 16; 1994

Brazil helps Pitt's Joyce develop

frame into the pack and coming
away with a rebound.

Yet, in spite of all Joyce’s
offensive skills, Bruce considers
her one of most fundamentally
sound defenders on the team.

“We have the utmost confi-
dence in Jenine to be able to
play the other team’s best scor-
ing guard and to be our best
scoring guard at the same time.
If you have those kinds of
responsibilities, that is a major
task,” Bruce said.

The former Penn Hills star
stretches her versatility beyond
her physical abilities on the
ﬂoor. Joyce is not by any means
a vocal player, but she tends to
chime in at times when her
teammates can use some bol-
stering.

“She wants her teammates to
do well,” Carol Morton, Joyce’s
backcourt partner, said.

“If we make mistakes, she
supports us. She’ll say ‘Carol,
keep it up.’ Because she is such
a sincere person, I look to her
for that.”

“I think even if you do some-

thing bad, you should hear
something positive,” Joyce said.
“I just hate to see somebody get
mad at another teammate.”

Joyce’s success at Pitt this sea-
son has been supported by her
family, which follows her career
adamantly.

Joyce’s aunts and uncles join
her parents in the stands at
nearly every game. Her father
works the night shift just so he
can catch all the games.

Joyce’s grandfather even tried
getting a hypnotist in an effort
to regain her shooting touch last
year

“They don’t even play, but"

that’s pretty much their life,”
Joyce said.

Joyce also has her believers

among the Pitt team.

Morton, who is Joyce’s room-
mate on road trips, called Joyce
“the nicest, most genuine indi-
vidual I’ve ever met anywhere.”

“She deserves this," Bruce
said. "The fact that she is play-
ing well and the fact that
we are winning —-— she
deserves it.”

Bounced

Continued from page 9

The first 3:32 of the game was
enough to quiet the Pitt faithful.
St. John’s quickly jumped out to
a 13-1 lead, led by Derek Brown
and Charles Minlend.

However, the Panthers fought
back by going on a 18-5 run of
their own and took the lead for
the first time at 19-18 at the 9:19
mark. Jason Maile led the attack
by scoring 10 of his 14 points
during this run by the Panthers,
which included three steals, two
treys and a block by Eric
Mobley.

The rest of the half was up
and down and contained 10
lead changes. It ended with the
Redmen leading by the score of
48-41.

Pitt came out tough in the
second half but just couldn’t get
over the hump as St. John’s
maintained its lead. A few times
the Panthers cut the lead to four
and a couple of times to three,
but that was as close as they
could get. ‘

With 5:46 remaining in the
game, Mobley got whistled for a
technical foul, and St. John’s
was able to open its lead to 10.

“I didn’t even say anything to
him, but [the ref] said that I said
a couple of words that I
shouldn’t have, and he gave me
the technical,” Mobley said.

Despite the technical, Mobley
finished with 16 points and 16
rebounds. Chris Gant also
chipped in with 15 points and
six boards, and Ahmad Shareef
ended his career with 12 points.
Andre Alridge also looked
good, dishing out four assists
and not turning the ball over.

A concern for Pitt going into
the tournament was how the
uncertainty of the program’s
future would effect the team’s
play.

“It really hasn’t been that hard
to concentrate because I knew
it was almost over for me, so I
just came out and told myself to
play hard,” Mobley said. “Even
in practice, sometimes I was
thinking back to when I first
started playing and I said to
myself that I can’t just go out
there and be lackadaisical. I just

V have to play.”

Mobley’s near future will con-
sist of NBA scouting camps. He
said that he plans on taking this
week off to get in shape for a
camp that is next week in
Phoenix.

“I’m going to start running the
stadium steps and stuff like that.
I am going to try to be in the
best condition I can to go out
there,” Mobley said.

Evans said that he did not
have any strong emotional reac-
tion to the contest being his last
at Pitt immediately after the
game.

Continued from page 9

at the 9:27 mark when an Erin
Maloy three-point shot put Pitt
up 22-12.

The Hurricanes stayed close
and trailed only 34-29 at the half
despite a scintillating start from

,Pitt power forward Jonna

Huemrich, who fired in 15
points and grabbed nine
rebounds before the break.

Carolyn Miller’s hoop three
minutes into the second half
brought the margin back to 10
at 40-30, and Miami could get
no closer than an eight—point
deficit the rest of the way.

Pitt’s struggles at the free-
throw line kept the Hurricanes
close. The Lady Panthers hit
only 11 of 26 free throws in the
contest.

“Our free-throw shooting in
general was poor, but we made
a couple when we needed to,”
Bruce said.

Pitt won the contest inside.
Pitt centers Miller and Missy
Thompson combined for 21
points and 11 boards, but
Huemrich was the star. The
senior power forward hit 12 of

point and rebound totals were
the best for any individual play-
er in the tournament.

“Jonna played fantastic,”
Bruce said. “She hit everything
she put up. She really asserted
herself.”

Huemrich continued to earn
her spot on the all—tournament
team with 20 points and 10
rebounds in the second round
against Seton Hall.

The rest of the Pitt offense
struggled as the Lady Panthers
hit 37 percent from the floor on
the way to a 66-54 loss, their
third loss of the season against
the Pirates.

“We were disappointed that
we didn’t hang in there a little
better with Seton Hall. We
played good defense, but we
just couldn’t score.”

Pitt shut down Seton Hall’s
top scorer, Jodi Brooks, holding
the point guard to eight points
on two-of-15 shooting. The
Panthers also held forwards
Shamona Marable and Texlin
Quinney, who had hurt Pitt ear-
lier this season, to a combined
eight points.

Part of Pitt’s offensive trouble
came from a lack of three-point
shooting, as the team hit only
two of 10 beyond the arc.

“All year long, that’s been the

thing that has helped us hang in
with people,” Bruce said.
