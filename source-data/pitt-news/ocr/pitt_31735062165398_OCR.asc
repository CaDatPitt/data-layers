To Use Religion Cards

By JOSEY Gn_o_s_sMAN _ _
Religious preference cards, issued for the first time in

. “three years, will be a “big help,” the University chaplains

  

- known,”

have stated.

The chaplains requested the re-institution of the cards
so that they could more easily contact those interested in
their various traditions. After they were turned in the cards

run 1~iir:i5"i4zsws -*iuona’a'x'r. 'septem‘be:' 10.1962

immediately sorted by IBM and:

distributed to the chaplains. Fill-
ing them out was optional.

. “We found people all year long
who didn’t . know we were here
and would have liked to have
' commented the Rever-
end Phillip Walsh, director of
the Newman Club.

With this list of names and ad-
dresses, he feels, “we may get to
meet people who want to meet us
within their first year or two at
the University.”

Mailing Aided

The Reverend Paul E. Schrad-
ing, director of the Wesley Fel-
lowship, says that not only does
this means of mailing publicity
“give the students an idea of re-
ligious activities at the Univer-
sity,’ but it also gives the chap-
lains somewhere to start “in what
would otherwise be a hit and miss
.understanding of who was of
what tradition.”

The cards were issued for
years as part of the general in-
formation asked of registered
students, according to Frank J.

Callanen. Callanen is the ad-
ministrative assistant to Dr.
Alan C. Rankin, Assistant Chan-
cellor of Student and General
Affairs.

At that time they were ﬁled in
the Dean of Men’s and Women’s
Offices to be used by the chap-
lain or the students.

For the last three/ years there

I has been no one University chap-

lain; the cards were discontinued.
Last year the chaplains of the
various denominations had no list
of the students of their faiths and
therefore could not personally
contact them.
Six Religious Groups

Now, says Callanen, the chap-
lains are “doing more good than
ever before since they have these

_ lists of names.” Because they rep-

resent six religious groups——

Father Walsh, Catholic; the Rev-

Schrading, Methodist; Dr. Richard
Rubinstein, Jewish; the Rev.
Charles W. Carlson, Lutheran;
The Rev. Nelson Griffiths, Baptist;
and the Rev. Edward C.’ Riegert,
Presbyterian and United Church
of Christ—-“they can reach a far
greater percentage ‘of students
than could one chaplain trying to
serve them all."

Callanen continues, “With all
of them having services in Heinz
Chapel, that sanctuary is used
now for what it was really in-
tended.” Dr. Rubenstein agreed
with his “praise of the non-sec-
tarian policy of the administra-
tion.”

Officials To Study

A series of classes specifically
designed for part-time profession-
al study for officials of public

- and private agencies of the Pitts-

burgh districts will be held at
the University beginning Septem-
ber 10.

The Graduate School of Pub-
lie and Internationa.l affairs will
offer the series of seminars in the
late afternoon, evening and Sat-
urday morning.

University Program ,
To Aid African Nations

9 A three—year program to help Nigeria and other‘ new
African nations correct their critical shortage of trained

public administrators will be

carried out at the University

according to an announcement by Chancellor Litchﬁeld.
The program will be administered by the University’s
Graduate School of Public and International Affairs and W111

be headed by Dean Donald C9

Stone. It is being ﬁnanced by the
Agency for International Develop-
ment of the United States Gov-

_ernment. The school will work

withthe Institute of Public Ad-
ministration at Zaria, .-Northern
Nigeria, to expand and upgrade
the course offerings and other
services of the. Institute.
Northern Nigeria, the largest
unit in the Nigerian Federation,

is one of the most densely pop- ’
pulatedv areas of Africa. ‘In 1960

when Nigeria became indepen-

. dent, only 20 per cent of the ad-

ministrative posts in the Northern

, Regional government were filled

by Northerners. The University

Chancellor Returns
From Investigation

Of Program Plans

Returning home from Pittsburgh
from an investigation of the pos-

sibilities of a long-term co—opera-
tive program between the Univer-
sity and the Central University of

Quito, Equador, Chancellor Ed-
ward H. Litchfield called the pros-
-pects for such a program “chal-
lenging.” ’ A it

‘Other members of the ﬁve-man

University of Pittsburgh team that

left the US. for Equador on Au-
gust 51 were Dr. Henry Frank,

chairman of the Department of"

Chemistry; Dr. Jack Brich, chair-
man of the Department of Special
Education and Rehabilitation; Dr.
Wendell -Schaeﬁer, assistant dean
of the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs; and Dr.
Marshall A. Robinson, dean of the
Graduate, School of Business.

“We ﬁnd the prospects of inter-
national 'co-operation between ed-
ucational institutions a challeng-
ing one,” stated Dr. Litchﬁeld, for
“there is lively concern in Quito
for education, expressed by stu-
dents as well as faculty members.

Relationship’ Favored

“We are most interested in a
comprehensive relationship among
many of our faculties and the
faculties of Central’ University,”
added the Chancellor. '

While in Quito, the University
team met with the different per-
sonality divisions, both admini-
strative and collegiate, to dis-
cuss educational problems relat-
ing to possible curriculum revis-

.ions, University faculty partici-
pation,' and various divisional
integrations. ..

Special attention ‘was devoted

~

to the ﬁelds of engineering and

natural sciences, education, ac-
counting and business administra-
tion, and public ‘administration.
Also surveyed during the meetings
was a co-operative program in-
volving the exchange of Univer-
sity faculty members for graduate
students from Quito. '
U.S. Sponsored,

The project was sponsored by
the US. Agency for International
Development which’ would, also
pay the substantial cost of the
contemplated program under a_
contract it would make with the
University.

The possible formation of such
an agreement will be discussed at
a meeting in Washington, D.C. be-
tween the Chancellor and agency
ofﬁcials. The meeting will take
place sometime in the near future.

REPORTERS

A meeting for all staff writ-
ers of the Pitt News will be
held‘ in the news office, Thurs-
day at 1 p.m. Students interest-
ed in ‘joining the newspaper
staff should also attend.

Sour Stuff I
Stings Citrus

Commission

The grapefruits one may buy
a few years hence may be less
sour as a result of research
which has begun at the univer-
sity. _‘ “

Dr. Ersten V. Miller, professor
of, Botany and Biological sciences,
has begun to grapple with the
problem with a grant of $5,000
from the Florida ‘Citrus Com-
mission. .

The Florida Citrus Commission,
3 State agency engaged in pro-
moting and regulating the citrus
industry in Florida, has. awarded
Dr. Miller the grant to ‘study and
solve the difficulty of sourness in
grapefruits.

Roper Worked First"

A former University graduate,
Bert E. Roper, who now works
for; a A co—operative engaged in
growing, shipping _and processing
citrus fruits ﬁrst sought ‘an. an-
swer for the improvement .of
grapefruit.

. He consulted his former major
advisor, Dr. Miller, and discuss-
ed i the matter with him.

Formerly associated with the
US. Department of Agriculture
in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Miller
was very much interested in the
ﬁeld. When he was asked by‘Rop-
er to undertake the research pro-
ject he readily agreed.

Proceeded to Convince

‘Roper then proceeded to con-
vince the.Citrus Commission that
Dr. Miller was their man for the
job. That, Dr. Miller recalls, was
not {all smooth sailing.

‘After many discouraging ex-\‘
periences Roper was able to
convince the oﬂicials that,
though the University was quite
a distance from the citrus pro.
duction. it would be the ideal
place to have the research per-
formed. . —

Dr. Miller explained that the
will not be working with -the

‘Mr. Emanuel Rubin of the Mu-
SIC Department has announced
that tryouts for ‘the Glee Club are

September. The Glee Club is ex-
Panding both its musical activi-
ties and its membership this
year,” Mr. Rubin stated.

The Glee Club is open to any
University man,

Interested persons may make
an appointment with Mr. Rubin,
contact any member of the Glee
Club. Or Simply come to rehear-
sals for tryouts. Rehearsals are
held Monday, Wednesday and

Activities planned for this year

plants themselves; instead he will
do his experimentation and test
his theories on grapefruit seed-
lings.
Acid Brings Sourness
cA factor that seems to contrib-
ute to sourness in citric fruits
is the acid content in the ripe
fruits.

Being aware of the cause of
and effect, Dr. Miller plans to
prevent oxidation of sugar
which produces citric acid, or
reduce it. ’
Dr. Miller believes that if ‘a

chemical compound works on
micro-organisims it also will be
effective on full-grown plants.
He has some ideas about inhibit-
ing the production of citric acid
in moles, which he is proceeding
to varifypﬁrst.
Expects to Review
If the present “leads” fail to
attain the goal, then Dr. Miller
expects to review the results ob-
tained for other possibilities.

Currently, he is working on
the assumption that the plants,
as the higher form of life, have
hormones which can be artiﬁci-
ally stimulated or paciﬁed.
Should this prove correct, then

the resulting compound would
only have to be used on a “parts-
per-million” basis and Dr. Miller

Russian Class Expands

The department of Slavic Lan-

sections are open to students who
have taken Russian 1 and 2. In-

may now register. Russian 164
(Chekhov) is taught in English
and is open -to seniors and gradu-
ate students in other departments.
Russian 861 (Survey of Rus-

Really Rally
The schedule of events for the University’s 175th
Anniversary Celebration is ambitious, to“ say the least.
Encompassing intellectual symposia, Fall Convocation, the
dedication and groundbreaking ceremonies of newfbuild-
fings, social events, athletics, brass bands and even ﬁre-
works,.the program is designed to offer something for
; everyone. .As a result, the celebration has required more
Yplanning, man-hours and money than any other comparable
[event in the school’s history. “
The success of the festivities hinges largely upon the
degree of support by the student body, which has become
I "the target for the major portion of the Anniversary Com-
}mittee’s concern. ,
The members of the committee will have an oppor-
tunity to appraise the level of campusgenthusiasm ,before
’ the Anniversary observance begins, however. This‘ -will

‘posed to kick off the University’s football season.
But morethan just the members of the Anniversary
;,committee will witness the rally; several million more,’ in

vision network as an example of the nation’s colleges. which
soon will be gripped by an expected epidemic offootball
 fever. . _

‘The fact that the rally is being televised coast-to-coast
adds to the necessity of its success.- But such outward dis-
plays of student enthusiasm have been notoriously lacking
at this campus. ‘

‘ Enough has beenswritten on the subject of student
apathy; not enough has been done about it. Let it be said,
however, that in view of the circumstances, the bonﬁre
‘rally deserves as much support as the major events of the
’Anniversary celebration. Being the ﬁrst stud'ent-wide'func-

tuable piece of nation-wide publicity‘ for the University, the
studentslowe it to themselves, the school and, of course, the
football team to make sure that the event is supported
' to the fullest extent.

The Beaten Path   

 

By Jim O'Brien

fact. For the University has been chosen by a major te1e- '

tion of the trimester and simultaneously being an inval-_

Click. The nine ball drops into a side pocket,
the cue ball hits one cushion and stops near the
center spot. A

A small, nattily ‘dressed man named ,Wi1lie

' Mosconi’ ‘moved rapidly around

ball -in sight — with one hand.

“This pressure is getting me,”

he said witha sigh.»

 When one 'of, my‘ miscued
' shots trickled‘ into
pocket, he scowled, “What are
~> ya doin’, ‘hustling me?”'

. The sharp shooterl displayed
an incredible repertoire of masse
shots, bank shots, gather shots
and combinations, with just
enough English and the right ainount of draw. '

He was giving an exhibition of his skill at
pocket billiards at the Cue and -Cushion, 4010
Clairton Blvd. (Route 51'), and he was defending
his reputation as the best there is. This writer was
in the neighborhood and decided‘ to hustle the
master. _ '

I ‘had to_,set him up. Here was the man, gray-
haired and a dapper '48, who had ‘coached Jackie
Gleason and Paul Newman for their pool-playing
roles in “The Hustler.” , ‘

I intentionally missed easy“ shots, scratching
often andcomplaining that itwaswnot my day. My
stomach was bothering me, .my contact lenses
needed changing. I had personal problems on my
mind, the light was bad andbthe table “rolls off
to the left.” ’ H .1 . '

He gave me a break. _ .

That is, he let me break’, the rack. I’d scatter
them and then he’d, collect them in the holes.

That fascinating sharp shooter with a’ trace of
a sardonic smile would say, “You better make this
shot or its Katey bar the 'door_.”_ Then he’d make
all the remaining balls on his turn.’

"Rack" Havoc ' ’ ._

Then he’d break the balls and make them all’
in a quick tempo. "Then he’d break the next rack
and run out again. I '

“I don’t even have a, shot,” I cried. ~

“And that, ladies and -gentlemen, is the ‘Uni- _

versity of Pittsburgh,” the. guide would state as
he points skyward to the top ofjthe Cathedral. He
would; continue with,_ “Total enrollment, about
14,000.” And through the mind
of each tourist would go the
thought that a‘ person could get
lost even from‘ himself among"
so many students.

With the rank odor of hydro-
gen sulﬁde, the ominous Vrolllitllg
of the trol1eys,'\the spasmodic
din ‘of construction, and the
aching throb , of homesickness
engulﬁng the inhabitants of the
University community, the pulse
of the institution struggles ‘to’
set a more steady pace. Chaos is now personified
to the newer members of the set as they try to
assimilateinto a massive student body. As the
tempo quickens and threatens to lose the slower

 

ones, it becomes agreed upon that this is no place-

for a fellow or lass who is still tied to the apron
strings. Some would say that in an atmosphere
such as exists here, character is molded and baked
solid. All this may be true enough, but each indi-
vidual faces the danger of becoming a droplet
afraid to digress from the stream.

Too Late For Some

These words of warning may come too late to
the upperclassman who is bounding around in
midstream, unable to swim to shore. For he has
already allowed too many people to “put him in
his place.” He has already silenced his opinion as
towhat courses to take. He has made the mistake
of letting the “system” decide his fate. He is now
either too scared to think for himself or has for-

gotten how. Let us hope that he is in an extreme -

minority.

   

 

» dent must refrain from giving up his freedom to, -

  
    
 

._an ope mind. 

_For although aluniversity is a source of knowl-
edge, it is even more important as an instigator’ ‘of-_
personal opinion. The foremost purpose of edu-
cation today — and always has been — is to in-’__
crease’ the range of man’s ability to _reason.";
Granted," many times this ability is put to misuse.- r1’-I
Many minds run along channels which are not‘. ' it
entirely beneﬁcial to our society. But even the-
most extreme radical contributes more than does
the ‘person who only regurgitates facts when "
called» upon. . ‘ ‘
Beware Conformity ' _ 

So, to those persons who are now being “mo1d..’ 
ed into men of '-character,” beware that the tide ’' 
of conformity does not sweep you into its midst. J
Each student must reserve-the right to say no. He; '. 
must reserve the right to question what is put _ 
before him. Freshmen students comeacross a test’ it
,of this character when they allow their advisors
to push unwanted courses upon them. In rou"n‘d-1
table discussion each s-tudent faces the decision.as7 .
to whether or not to disagree with the‘ general 
trend. Even though his opinion may be entirely. ‘
wrong, by voicing it he will at least force others‘
to defend and possibly evaluate their opinions.

During these ﬁrst few weeks of the term it

Adventurous Poet

‘Ed Roberson Ready To Go; Says
‘Mountain Climbing Relaxes Me’

By. STAN STEIN

Mountain climbing has been de-
scribed by many people in many
ways invigorating, exciting,
educational, healthful, relaxing

—;,q_. . . relaxing? At least Ed Rober-
' son describes it" as relaxing.

Ed Roberson is a senior English
major at the University. He writes
poetry and is the editor of Ideas
and Figures, the Liberal Arts ma-
gazine, Mountain climbing is his
hobby.

In‘June, 1963, Ed will partici-

pate in a scientiﬁc expedition to i

the -Peruvian and Ecuadorian

ustungles and from there begin _the

1‘ assault on three or four peaks, two
of which have never been climbed
before.

Two Phases .

The expedition will be made in
two ‘phases. The first will involve
the moving of the expedition into
a high camp in the Cordillera
Blanca and from there climbing
the three or four peaks, one of
hkwhich is Oschilopacka, some 20,-
000 feet in height. ’

The sqcond phase will con-
sist of an assault on the active
volcano El Sangay and the
study of the head-hunting Ji-
varo' Indians. H

Preparations for the expedition
began some time ago, and it is

Ed’s job, along with S. Colbeck,

petroleum engineer and expedi-

tionary geologist, to raise much of
the money to sponsor the trip.
0 Others Include
Other members ‘of the expedi-
tion include Ivan J irak, geograph-
' er and mountain climbing instruc-

tor. at the University; Dr. H. A.

Bloom, expeditionary anthropo-

logist and editor of Human
Ecology Foundation ‘and Review

and Newsletter; Dr. B. Ewers, ex-.

. peditionary physician‘ and medical

' -,ji‘_’§e’se"archer. .

Joseph Ruddley will , be the
expeditionary dietician and so-
ciologist, Paul Graham will be
another ,sociologist, and Kent-
Heathershaw will accompany

‘ the expedition as a mountain-
eering rescue and survival spe-
cialist. - - 6

Each member of the expedition"

“ will be responsiblefor conducting
experiments and gathering data
in certain ﬁelds of science, includ-
Hing anthropology, biology, geo-
graphy, high altitude accommoda-

, tion,'socio1ogy and volcanology.

Climbed Cliffs
Roberson-’s climbing and scien-
tiﬁc experience consists of bio-
logical expeditions- to Alaska, in

"1960, and Bermuda, in 1961. He
has been a mountaineering in-
structor and has climbed several
cliﬁ faces in. the Tri»-state area,

ﬁincluding White Rocks, Slippery

Rock Canyon in Pennsylvania, and

Seneca Rocks in West Virginia.

R.0berson"s ﬁeld will be bi-
ology, but he hopes to get much
more out of the trip than sci-
entiﬁc knowledge, for, as men-
tioned before, he is a write:-,
not a scientist.

thing you.‘,_Tf:;‘T.aw how to do and do

laxing” art of climbing mountains.
eludes personnel from the Universirt-y’s faculty. Target — South

America.

 

The scientiﬁc expedition in-

“It’s not the grandeur and it's.

*s§1£, because there are no specta- V

tors and even your fellow climb-
ers can’t tell if your doing well.”
Puts in New Light

Ed seems to put the sport of

' mountain climbing in a new light.

“Mountain climbing is the most
personal /' of sports,” he said. “I
discover that more guys talk to
themselves. You are alone so much
and you keep asking yourself
‘What am I doing here?’ And you
get some good answers, too.”

' Ed maintains that “You are

your own judge’ and your think-
ing has more to do with_c1imb-
ing than your muscles, and I
‘have been fortunate enough to
learn mechanical discipline as
well as discipline of attitude.”
Ed. learned these disciplines
from Ivan Jirak, the expedition-
ary geographer, with whom he
will instruct mountaineering stu-
dents in a University course to be
offered between Sept. 11, 1962 and

 

Monday; ‘
Bi-weekly Meets

In M ountairteeI*irzg

ings will be held in 342 CL.
Subjects discussed will include
various rock climbing techniques,
cave exploring, glaciology, vol-
canology, meterology. Movies and
slides will be frequently used to

ledge and gain practical experi-
ence in the subjects discussed.

Free To All

The course is offered free to
all, and the equipment needed
is also provided by the instruc-
tors. The student needs a text
book (750), and has to share ex-
penses for the field trips he at-
tends.

or desiring more information
about the program should con-
tact Ivan L.. Jirak at 1309 CL,

from our vantage point.
Here we dissolve and inter-—

view Miss Lichenstein.”
Vasanth comments that foreign
students are strangers in a strange
land, like ﬁsh out of water, but
the special orientation program
for the foreign students together
with hospitality through the Pitts-
burgh Council for International
Visitors and the understanding

' rhelp given by Miss Lichenstein

and her assistant Miss Ruth Coop-
er makes everyone feel at home.
_ Tries to Aid
Miss Lichtenstein agrees and
says that she tries to aid the stu-

A dents in every way she can as

she feels that they need indivi-
dual attention to their problems.
The program continues with

a bird's eye view of the campus.’
Vasanth sees the Health Center,
Health Professions buildings,
the University affiliated hospit-

_ als, Field House and Pitt Sta.-

dium, and the Engineering
buildings. He tells a little about
the activities in each of these
buildings.
The program next disolves to
interview Dr. Alfred J. Berger,

_ professor in Chemistry and head
‘of Metallurgical Engineering.

He speaks of his visit to Latin

.American countries and a group

of students who are studying in

‘ his department.

Is it Proper?
Mike Levine asked whether Dr.

._Berger feels that it is proper for
the American Universities to ad-

mit foreign students and as a re-
sult refuse admission to the
American students due to lack of
facilities.

.“If the American Universities
do not provide the opportunity
to foreign students to study
here, the Russians might do it

o . .” Dr. Berger replied. "

Vasanth said that Dr. Raymond
G. Fitterer, Dean of Engineering
and Mines, was away on a trip
but “we may return and interview
him, too.”

Bhat Points Out

Continuing on his tour, Bhat

points out Langley and Clapp Hall,

VWQED, ‘Mellon Institute, Heinz

Memorial Chapel, Soldiers and

‘ Sailor Memorial hall, Syria Mos-

que, Stephen Foster Memorial

Hall, Carnegie Museum and Li-

brary, and speaks about them all.

He points out the location of
the new Fine Arts building and
talks briefly on the expansion
plan of the University. He also
points out the Carnegie Institute
of Technology, “a sister organi-
zation of the University."

A The program next spotlights the
Cathedral of Learning itself. Bhat
tells~about the departments in the
building and then interviews Dr.
William B. Crafts, dean of men.

Crafts Comments

Crafts comments that the young
foreigner “tends to act as an
American and adjusts to our way
of life sooner than an older per-
son.” He also talks about the stu-
dent activities on campus.

‘I The program disolves to in-
terview Irving N. Rothman, di-
rector of. student publications
and student affairs. He talked
about the purpose of publica-
tions, objectives, and outlook.

“There is complete freedom of
press as seen in f‘Pitt News” and
WPGH and other publications.

Gives Brief Resume

He gave brief resume of other
student activities such as Debat-
ing Union, Student Government,
Student Union and others.

Next, Vasanth talks with
Arthur H. Fedel, administrative
assistant vice chancellor of aca-
demic disciplines. He remarks
that the teaching staff is friend-
lyand ready to aid any student
with difficulty. '

“I think that there is no diffi-
culty or difference in teaching a
foreign student . . . Mostof them
are proﬁcient in the English lan-
guage.” ’ ‘ '

Four times the number of ex-
pected students entered the Uni-
versity’s new Graduate Library
School when it opened last Tues-
day. The University had expected
30 potential librarians, however,
125 have already been accepted
for the graduate course.

In addition to «those students
who are working for a Master of
Library Science degree, many ap-
plications‘ were received from
housewives and working people
who want to attend part-time. To
handle this situation the school
has scheduled evening classes, ac-
cording to’ the office of Dean
Harold Lancour.

Many of the students
class are from Pennsylvania. The
class, however, includes students
from as far away as Canada, the
Philippines, and Taiwan.

Fellowships Awarded

Four‘ ,of the students were
awarded fellowships voted by the
Pennsylvania Legislature to help
lessen the state’s shortage of pro-
fessional librarians. Seventeen of
the other students are transfers
from the Carnegie Library School,
which closed this year.

 i Review, Of 1962 Owl

Yearbook Quality Rated  

By MATT SWETONIC

Coming out a few weeks late
this year has done little to damp-
en the enthusiasm and» praise for
the recently released 1962 Owl.
Among the many ﬁne editions of

the yearbook printed in past years‘

this one stands up as probably the
best of the lot and is certainly
comparable in quality to the
award winning releases of many
higher rated _ American universi-

, ties.

As the main carrying point of
a yearbook is generally consider-
ed to be photography and photo-
graphy alone, the literary work
has, in many colleges, been sub-
jugated to a third rate position
handled with a minimum of effort
and certainly of skill. This year’s
Owl, however, has blended the
two essentials magniﬁcently to
produce not only a record of ev-
ents and faces but, in essence, a
printed memorial to life on this
campus.

No finer example of this exists
than the superb registration pic-
ture and accompanying write up
occuring in the early part of the
introductory essay. The student
seen standing on the table de-
manding his rights portrays the

chaos and consternation of regis-

tration as no other picture could,
and the write up to the left does
not merely describe the situation
but adds to it, completes the mood,
and injects life where a picture
alone could not.
Quality Secret

Such is the secret behind the
high quality of the '62-Owl. The
photography and write ups do not
stand apart to be evaluated inde-
pendently, instead they accent

each other, developing a continu-
ous and most enjoyable whole.
Of course, the standardized
group shots cluttering the pa-
ges of all college yearbooks are
not lacking in the Owl, how-
ever where ever possible com-
plementary shots. have been
added to lend quality where
generally only egotistic interest
prevails.

Besides the use of continuously
outstanding pictures, a certain in-
novation in literary technique was
employed in many of the group

write-ups in an attempt to add a

more personal touch to these sec-
tions of the book.

Massed Phrases

This technique was the use of
a series of short catch-phrases
massed together and ‘pertaining
to the usually private activities of
the organization. They, beyond a
doubt, will make the book a more
memorable record in future years
to those included in these groups,
however to the outsider they are

m e r e 1 y a conglamoration of A

meaningless little nothings, which
is of course, exactly what they
were intended to be.

That this technique succeeded
in its purpose is hardly debat-
able, yet it is an innovation re-
stricted in its application to
those organizations whose ac-
tivities are not purely academic.
Ths should. however, not deter
the Owl staff from any further
use of the technique, for it tends
to make a simple yearbook into
a personal scrapbook, and such
a quality is highly admirable in
this type of publication.

In other respects concerning the
book, little comment is needed.

. Highest In Recent Years

The general layout is essentially
the same as in the ’6l Owl, and
being as this layout was excellent
there was no need to change it in
this new edition, however when
one book begins to resemble too
closely those of past years the
student tends to pass it by as a
duplicate instead of a mere fac-
simile. ' ,

Yet, to say th at a yearbook
should undergo a complete struc-
tural change each year is also
to say that last year’s book was
not completely satisfactory in
many respects. This is certainly
not the, case with the ’62 Owl.
Improvements could, of course, be
made in certain areas but they
would be minor and would in no
sense throw any discredit on this
year’s magniﬁcent edition.

Gridders Practice

To Halt Mia-miAce  

By BOB SMIZIK .
‘Last year a porous pass de-

fense was the downfall of the
Panther gridders in more
than one game. Whether

Coach John Michelosen and, n
his staff have corrected this .

major flaw willbe found out in

the season opener against Miami.’

The signal" caller for the _Hur-
ricanes is "All-America candidate
George Mira. Even before he
played his ﬁrst game last year
Mira had been ‘pegged for star-
dom. ’

Though he was plagued by in:

juries last year he did nothing.

to hurt this reputation. He only
made believers _of all the cynics.

’ Use Miami Plays .

In an‘ effort to throttle Mira,
who has been partially trained
(by the great Johnny Unitas, de-
fensive backﬁeld coach Carl De-
Pasqua hashis} charges already
working against Miami plays.

“The boys will have to be on.
their toes all the time against

Mira,” DePasqua said. “If you’re 3

not he is always liable to con-
nect with a long bomb for a
touchdown,”

_ At the present there is no spec-
ial defensive backﬁeld working
together. “We’re just trying to get
the ﬁrst three units to be able
to go both offensively and de-
fensively,” DePasqua said.

The much, - publicized Head
Hunters have temporarily taken
a back seat in an effort to get
the top three teams in game
shape. V .
' Lehner At Safety
One 'player,that is sure to see

‘ a lot of Mira is quarterback Glen
Lehner. S'afetyman"would be the -

moreappropriate term for Lehner
since he spends just about all of
his time ‘playing defense.

GRIDIRON KNIGHTS — Soft, padded shields are employed. ii:
daily workouts to ward off’ hard-charging rushes. The real thing
doesn't begin until Sept. 15 when the players will have to fend
for themselves. Meanwhile scrimmages have been light as injuries

have been sidestepped nicely.

/

“Lehner will probably be
playing defense for our quarter-
backs most of the time,” De-
Pasqua said. Other than Lehner,
however, the coach refused to
singleout any one player for
having the stu::- to stop Mira.

‘‘All the boys are making a tre-
mendous effort on pass defense,”
he said.— “I’d hate to single any-
one out.”

Basketball Sport

Recruits Three I
Only three new basketball play-

ers will arrive fresh on the cam-

pus scene this year.

One of, them, Bob Roman, a 5-

points a game for Johnstown Col-
lege last year, may step right into
a starting position.

Two freshman scholarship—hold-
ers, the lowest number ever re-
cruited by Coach Bob Timmons,
will appear.

Larry Szykowny, a 6-2 guard
from North Catholic here, and Ro-
bert Lovett, a 6-6 center from
York, Pa. have chosen to come
here.

Szykowny was named All-Cath-
olic and guided his team to the

drives and could not cut,out.satis-

“I believe that the condition of
his knee is such,” said Gustafson,
“that it will not hold up under
constant pounding.

b,“Rather than risk the pos-

sibility of permanent injury, I
have advised him not to parti-
cipate in football.”

The 6-foot, 195-poundback said
he plans to completehis educa-
tion under his football scholarship.
Johns was a quarterback when he
starred ‘for Miami in Pitt .Stadium
two years ago.

His team lost,~17-6, but Johns
completed seven of 11 passes, in-
cluding a 26-yard touchdown
strike to end Bill Miller.

The coaches do not plan to do

any special work with the Head‘

Hunters, other than what has al-
ready been done,. for the time
being. “We’ll have to wait and

see how the boys pan out with
their respective units . before we
make any decisions as to who
will be playing with the ‘Head
Hunters,” DePasqua said.

A Coach's Big Net

By BOB SMIZIK
Associate Sports Editor

 

  

   

The coaches seemed worried. They had been talking
among themselves for quite a while until one decided that

some action must be taken.

A student manager was dispatched to a telephone and
told, “to get hold of Bill Kaliden -and get him over to see

Viney.”

--- Another coach felt the situa-
tion deserved even higher prior-
ity and said, “and tell him to take
Clyde Barton (assistant athletic
director) along.”

Scene of Crime

This traumatic scene took place
six days before school was set, to
start at the football team’s train-
ing camp in Meadville, Pa.

The message was relayed to
Kaliden. Later in the afternoon
he replied in'the negative. The
elusive Viney was nowhere to be
found. .

Something had gone afoul.
Bob Viney, a standout guard
from North Catholic High School,
was expected on the Pitt cam-
pus two days earlier, but never
arrived. The much sought after
prospect had sent in his papers
and paid his entrance fee at
Pitt. The coaching staff felt
they had a top line prospect in
the bag. _

Carl DePasqua, the coach who
had recruited Viney, felt he had
a good idea of the lad’s where-
abouts. The Panther backfield

‘mentor is wise in the ways of re-
‘cruiting and knew that Michigan

State had been hot after Viney.
- Added Numbers

He put two and two together
and was immediately on the phone
to East Lansing, Michigan, the
home of the Big Ten football
powerhouse.

An observer didn't have to
be listening in on the party line
to catch the gist of the conver-
sation. DePasqua’s chin dropped
like a good sinker ball when he
was informed that, “Viney’s
not here. but, he’s on his way

A
V

and will enroll here tomorrow.”

DePasqua, upon hearing the bad
news, was in no mood for a pro-
longed ‘conversation. “This is
very disappointing,” was about all
the stunned coach could say.

* b x ! ! !

DePasqua slammed the phone
down after a cordial parting. The
comic strips draw circles and the
like for what DePasqua had to
say. Then he remembered there
was a visitor in the room. A
forced smile crossed his face and
in a hollow twang he said, “that’s
what you have to put up with in
this job.” ' '

DePasqua had just cause for his
disappointment. Viney was a ﬁne
prospect whose talent was widely
sought after. A

The tough luck that befell
DePasqua and Pitt is typical of
many cases all over the coun-
try. Recruiting is getting to be
such a competitive business that
coaches have grown to expect
happenings such as this. .

A famous example of a player
making up his mind at the last
minute was Matt Szykowny, who
came from the same high school
as Viney, North Catholic.

Szykowny could not decide be-
tween Pitt or Iowa. Finally he
went west to the regret of a trio
of Panther coaches. He has gone
on to star in football and basket-
ball for the Hawkeyes.

Actually the football coaches
haven’t too much room to com-
plain. They have done a good job
of recruiting this year and no
doubt grabbed a COL1[.)l€\0f boys
at the last minute from someone
else, too.

Experienced Runners Promise

Better Season For Thin-Clads

Promise has been given of an
improvement on last year’s dis-
appointing cross—country record.

Returning veterans Steve Was-
lo, Larry Robinson, Richard Cook,
Bob Henry and Bill Mocnik
should push the improvement
plan forward.

Coach Carl Rees hopes the ex-
perience gained by the returnees,
plus the addition of promising
sophomores Jim Studnicki, Ralph
Basinski and John Bailey, will
merit a better season.

The team is rounding into
shape for their first meet with
Slippery Rock Sept. 22. Last
Tuesday was the ﬁrstteam work-
out but Coach Rees said the boys
have all been working out on
their own during the summer.’

Waslo, who posted a 4:20 tim-
ing in the mile last spring, is
expected to again lead the dis-
tance runners.

Help is expected to come from
two seniors who have been
‘watching the running forms of
a lot of good runners in three

Coach Rees stated that he would

Navy and West Virginia. All team
members will run in the four
home matches.

Rees is optimistic for a good
reason. He had a slow group last
fall but feels that most have im-
proved quite a bit. He says the
sophomores have good endurance
and some even savor this gruell-
ing combat.

ﬁnale. ' '

Eichenlaub and Hinchberger

 G. Shimpeno Challenging Top

  Soccer Veterans for,Top Role

Heads Impressive

Newcomer Listing ;,

By FRED MARCUS

George Shimpeno, a sopho-
more soccerman, is one from
a lengthy list of sophomores
whom Coach Leo Bemis feels
“should add depth and make
strong bids for many of the
starting positions.”

Shimpeno started to watch soc-

cer_ games when he was in grade
school,’ and he said, “I practiced

,,--whenever I got a chance, day or

:_,

“‘:’

night, morning or evening.”

At Springdale High "School, he.
played four years of soccer. He
spent three ' years on the first
string alone. During Shimpeno’s
last year at high school, the team
went undefeated.

Likes Vets

Shimpeno’sl interests vary from .

his history major to a liking for
popular music and dancing. He
hopes some day to ‘each.
Shimpeno commented that he
thinks “the soccer team will be
good this year since lots of posi-
tions are already ﬁlled in.”

Betnis added that “if this team

is willing to work hard at de-

Vﬁloping their good overall po-

tential ’and' combine this with

a desire to excel, they can be-

come one of" Pitt’s best soccer

teams by November!”

The sophomores expected to
give the lettermen the tightest
battles for positions are Dave
Reichenbach, Bill Kdvacs, wa1t

Power Shot

to groan, “Wow, what power!”
Paul Liberati, who was on the
All-American Squad and rated
All-Pennsylvania, Delaware, and

Rebuilding Job
Easier This Fall

New Jersey last year, will also be
back.

A strong point of this year’s
offense should be _ball control
and a balanced scoring attack.
Corky Cuthbertf even though he
scored 13 goals last year, still
has not realized his scoring po-
tential, according to Bemis.

He will be given support in the
line by letterman Bruno Schwartz,
Sam Donatelli, Jerry Yospin and
Ted Verlato.

Defensively the team can pre-
sent. an experienced lin e up
starting with Tom Staab in goal

l and _a fullback trio of Hanning-

ton Okoth at center-half, Chuck
Dunbar at right-full, and Rich
Venglik at left-full. '
Challenge Here

A halfback combination will be
centered, around Liberati. Kent
Rentschler and Mike Kahn,— who
both had considerable game ex-

perience last year, should wage

a real battle for the other half-
back slot.

Bemis does not face as exten-
sive a rebuilding task for this
fall as he did last year. Gradua-
tion took Captain Steve Daniels
and an All-District halfback
Ray Tarasi plus capable reserv- _
es George Georgakokis, Ronald
Mehock and George Harley.

This year’s schedule, however,
includes three of the nation’s best
teams in NCAA champion West
Chester State, NAIA champion
Howard University and the Ohio
League champion Akron Univer-
sity. '
