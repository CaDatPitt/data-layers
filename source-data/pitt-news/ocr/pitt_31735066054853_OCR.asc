Pitt’s Katz Business School main-
tains a steady supply of MBA students,

~ and meets the demand for them by mak-

ing sure the students graduate earlier
than almost any other business program
in the nation.

Students looking to pursue a busi-
ness degree of the highest quality need
look no further than the University’s
very own Katz Business School, accord-

Katz supplies MBAs for demanding world of business

The magazine recently named the
Katz Business School’s MBA program
as the “most bang for your MBA buck”
in its Oct. 21 issue.

The Katz Business School offers a

MBA degree, which usually takes two
years to complete, in one intensive 11-

month program. This creates a draw for

students because it cuts down on both
the cost of. tuition and the cost of lost
wages.

“The big issue for many students is

the loss in wages,” said Bill Avoli, a

full-time Katz MBA student. “You have

to consider that you normally lose two
years worth of wages when you go to
grad school.”

Robert Nachtmann, director of the
Katz school’s master’s programs, said
that the Katz program offers exactly the
same course content as other schools’
MBA programs, but they are delivered
in a different cycle.

Many MBA programs, such as
those offered at Harvard, the University
of Chicago, and Columbia, run on a
semester schedule similar to Pitt’s own
undergraduate cycle.

Schools such as these increase their
programs’ times of completion by giv-
ing breaks for the summer months and
vacation times. The Katz school com-
presses these 56 to 60 calendar week
programs into a 44 calendar week ses-
sion to help its students graduate sooner.

“Our program runs from mid-July
until mid-June of the following year,
with only two weeks of down time dur-

Students discuss healt care,
welfare, and immigration

   

The Pitt News held a focus group on
Saturday, Oct. 26, 1996 to discuss issues
relating to the upcoming presidential
election. Campus organizations such as
SGB, College Republicans, University
Democrats, CWO, BAS, and BiGaLA
were contacted. Only four students
attended. None were ajﬁliated with these
groups.

This week, The Pitt News is reporting
the issues discussed by the students.
Yesterdays topics were the economy, edu-
cation, and taxes. Today's issues are
health care, welfare, and immigration. '

-Health care coverage is a primary
concern for college students these days,
but whether the next president changes
the system or not, medical treatment will
always be a business with high costs to
patients.

-Welfare needs further reform,_and
both candidates support time limitations
on welfare recipients. But other changes
are also necessary in the welfare program.

-Illegal immigrants end up costing
tax payers too much. Clinton and Dole are
taking substantially different approaches
to dealing with immigration.

These issues, discussed by the four

C,” ' Jen " 8- .5“ “ti.

Pitt students who took part in Saturday’s
focus group, highlighted only some of the
matters prevalent to the upcoming presi-
dential election. '

The students shared their thoughts on
recent attempts by the federal government
to reform the health care and welfare sys-
tems and to curb immigration, but not all
participants agreed about whether, or how,
to instate universal health care in the U.S.

This past tenn, President Clinton
introduced a health care package assem-
bled by a task force headed by the First
Lady. Congress — led by House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who called the proposed
reform “socialism” — scrapped the
reform.

If enacted, the reform would have
made the U.S. health care system similar
to Canada’s, where every citizen is cov-
ered under a universal policy. According
to Tom Muldoon, a 20-year-old indepen-
dent from West Chester, Pa., Congress
was right to defeat the proposal.

“Health care is a fundamental need,
but the word ‘socialized’ scares people.
We’re not used to thinking in those
terms,” said Muldoon, who said he feels
the nation is moving towards socialized
medicine through managed care pro-
grams.

ers them into their 44 week curriculum.

“Our students are taking, on aver-
age, 4 to 6 credits more per 14 week
period than is a graduate student in
another school,” said Nachtmann.
“They are processing more credits per
unit of time with fewer breaks.”

According to Nachtmann, the
school’s advantage lies in “a manage-
ment processing perspective of trying to
reduce down time.”

Other graduate schools have recent-
ly tried to create one—year MBA pro-
grams, but have been unable to achieve
them with the success of the Katz
school. Similar programs admit only
students with certain qualifications,
such as an undergraduate degree in
business or similar other undergraduate
degrees.

Nachtmann said that the Katz MBA
program allows any student, regardless
of his undergraduate degree, to enter the
program and to conduct a professional
path of his choice.

The Katz school has been able to

escape from the traditional restraints of
MBA programs with such success
because of its ability to draw students
who are motivated to get their MBAs in
11 months, as well as its ability to draw
a faculty who are willing to teach all
year, without breaks.

“It’s a lot of work, both from the
management and faculty perspectives.
Our faculty have to be prepared that
they will be teaching, normally, every
summer,” said Nachtmann.

Katz graduates see a 63-percent
raise over their pre—MBA earnings,
according to Business Week. This ranks
it statistically among the better half of
post-degree eaming increases in the
nation.

Students, now in the middle of
exams, still seem to have good things to
say about their MBA program.

Avoli said he liked the Katz MBA
program.

“It’s a lot like the corporate world,”
he said. “When you get out of this pro-
gram, you’re ready for it.”

THE PITT NEWS 3

Museum offers more than
15 minutes worth of pop art

‘Heidi Price

If midterms are stressing you
out, try the relaxing technique of
lying out in the cool grass with the
orange and red autumn leaves
falling past your eyes as you watch
fat white puffs of clouds drift by
overhead.

Or you can surround yourself
with pink-cow wall paper and
Campbell soup can paintings while
lying beneath the pillow—shaped
aluminum “clouds” floating
through the decorated rooms of the
Andy Warhol Museum.

The museum, dedicated to one
of the most famous and influential
painter/photographer/filmmaker/sc
ulptors to emerge from the latter
half. of the 20th century, is dis-
counted for Pitt students with a
valid Pitt ID.

Warhol is the subject of the only
single—artist museum in the United
States, located at 117 Sandusky St.,
one block down from the Seventh
Street Bridge on the North Side.

Six months after taking office,
Thomas Sokolowski, the director of
the Warhol Museum, came to Frick
Fine Arts Thursday afternoon to
discuss Warhol, his art, and the
fresh appraisal approach to the
museum in the upcoming years.

“If one wants to consider Andy
Warhol as a painter, it wouldn’t
really put him on the cliff from
which he stands,” Sokolowski said.

“His long hand stretches
extremely far and grabs at things
that one would have never consid-
ered in the venue of a fine artist
before.” Sokolowski also
focused his discussion on under-
standing Warhol’s art. He said too
many art historians focus only on
Warhol the person, and the view of
him as a pop-culture icon, in an
attempt to understand what his
works meant.

Sokolowski stressed that in
order to understand the artist. you
need to look at the art as it stands
by itself.

The collection at the Warhol
Museum includes over 900 paint-
ings, 77 of his sculptures, 1500
drawings, more than 500 prints, and
about 400 black and white pho-

tographs.
The museum’s stark concrete
floors, contrasted against the

Gothic white columns, highlight
Warhol’s work vividly.

But it offers more than just art.
Collages of Warhol memorabilia,
including photographs, postcards,

news clippings, and quotes by the
artist and his friends offer a human-
istic portrayal of the personality
behind the famous silver wig and
dark sunglasses.

Warhol’s dead—pan humor is
seen in postcards written to his
mother who was living in Oakland
where Warhol grew up. He lived
near the post office at 3252 Dawson
St. ' .

One unsigned postcard that he
sent to his mother read, “I’m okay,
I’m in Japan.”

Another postcard, sent a few‘

weeks later read, “Hi, I’m all right.
I’m in Rome now. It’s real nice
here. Bye, me.”

Other more chaotic and brutal
portrayals of Warhol’s life are seen
in the clippings and photos of the
incident surrounding his near—fatal
gunshot wound by Valerie Solanas
on June 3, l968.

This incident did not thwart
Warhol’s genius, but in fact was the
catalyst for emergence into the
world of magazine publication.

Interview magazine, founded in
1969 by .Warhol, collaborated his
interests in fashion, film, and his
fascination with famous people.

His obsession with celebrities is
seen at the museum on the numer-
ous silk-screen prints of Marilyn
Monroe, Jackie Onassis, Elvis
Presley, Liza Minelli, and Mick
Jaggen

Sokolowski believes Warhol’s
time capsules, many of which
remain unopened at the museum,
will prove to be the most telling
artifact of Warhol’s life.

“Those famous time capsules,
that many of you have looked at
longingly,.” said Sokolowski, “will
be open more frequently in the next
couple of years to give forth more
information about the man whose
life ended a decade ago this
February.”

Examining the time capsules
and reading his many diaries will
provide insight into the complex
and multi—faceted personality of the
pop—artist.

The museum is closed on
Monday and Tuesday. The reduced
student rate of $3.00 with a valid
Pitt ID allows students to take
advantage of the many upcoming
diverse exhibitions and programs.

And if all the local haunted
houses haven’t frightened you
enough, on Oct. 30, the Warhol
museum will celebrate the Mexican
folklore tradition in honoring the
Day of the Dead in the museum’s
Skull galleries.

gram.

“If you socialize medicine,
doctors won’t strive for excel-
lence,” said Therese Tallarico,
20, an independent from
Philadelphia. “The best doctors
won’t stand out."

Reem Horani, from
Greenville, Pa., and Amanda
Keller, of Lansdale, Pa., cited the
cost of health care reform as their
primary concerns.

“No matter what system we
move towards, health care is
always going to cost an arm and

Despite his

reform health care, Clinton did

and has promised to “end wel-
fare as we know it.” He signed a
welfare reform bill that will

requirements on welfare recipi-
ents and cut $54 billion in wel-
fare programs.

Bob Dole, if elected, said he
would instate a five-year lifetime
cap on welfare for each recipient
and would deny beneﬁts ‘to sin-
gle teen—age mothers unless they
live at home and stay in school.

Horani and Muldoon agreed

itations for recipients.

argued that ﬁve years on welfare
was too long. “Allow them to
have welfare for, like, three
months, until they get a job,” she
said. “And then if they don’t get

THE PITT NEWS

Members of the focus group
had ideas for welfare. reform
unlike those of Clinton or Dole,
such as training recipients and
reforming welfare so a person is
always better off financially if
they work.

Tallarico picked up on the
“tough love” concept tossed
around by politicians. Her idea
was based on preparing people
for the work force.

“Either cut how much they
get so they have to go out and
find a job, or give them a certain
amount of money, and then train
them to get a job,” Tallarico said.
“A real job, maybe not minimum
wage-paying, but a career.”

Both candidates support lim-
its on the amount of time a per-
son can receive welfare, but nei-
ther have mentioned job training
to aid welfare recipients in enter-
ing the work force.

Another reform idea came
from Keller, who said that there
needed to be a reform which
made it better for a mother with
children to work —— even at min-
imum wage —— than for her to be
on welfare.

“As it stands right now, they
get more money on welfare than
they do working a 40-hour week
with a minimum wage job,” said

covers back,” said Carter. “When I
heard the sound. I turned and looked
and the bed I had just made was pulled
back and it it had a head print on the pil-
low.” Carter took a second look and all
he could say was, “l’ll be damned.”

“It didn’t occur to me right away
that it was a ghost, something just was-
n’t right -— it was kind of weird,” said
Carter. “There wasn’t much to it, but
how do you explain it? If someone can
offer me another explanation, I’d surely

. ' accept it.”

Carter originally denied he’d ever
had supernatural experiences in the
room.

“People used to always ask me if I
saw anything, and I’d just say ‘nah’
until that happened,” Carter said. “Then
I just said that I’d rather not talk about
it.”

It wasn’t until his boss asked him
about it after hearing rumors that he
finally opened up. “Believe me, I‘d just
as soon have this never have happened,”
he said.

Bruhn said she feels these unex-
plained happenings have to do with her
grandparents. “I donated my grandpar-
ent’s quilt to the room, the ones that was
moved,” she said. “It was the one they
spent their wedding night under.”

posals as well, stating that illegal immi-
grants hurt the country ﬁnancially. Keller,
who will be studying in Europe, agreed.

“When you go to England, you have
to have a job before you get there,” Keller
said. “Not that I’m against immigration,
because I do believe the living situation
here is sometimes better for people from
different countries  but I do think that
they shouldn’t be allowed to live off wel-
fare, that they should be responsible for
having a job or some way to support
themselves when they get here.”

Tallarico e was quick to agree but
added that foreign refugees often immi-
grate on the spur of the moment and can’t
make arrangements ahead of time for a
job.

However, according to Muldoon,
immigration, legal or illegal, is not a
national problem.

“I think immigration serves a really
big part of our work force and our labor
force,” he said. “We’ve had such a chal-
lenge to move from blue collar work
ethics and onto white collar that we need
laborers, and I think that a certain per-
centage of immigrants are making up that
percentage.

“It’s sort of necessary to have them as
a part of the labor force because we, as
Americans, tend to devalue manual
labor,” he said.

Tomorrow: abortion, gay rights, and
gun control.

THE PITT NEWS

Although Bruhns never had an
experience with spirits herself, she
hopes to someday meet her grandpar-
ents after death, especially her grand-
mother (who just—so-happens to have
been a cousin to Edgar Allen Poe.) “I
also want to spend the anniversary of
their marriage in this room,” said
Bruhns.

Carter wasn’t the only one to have
something unexplained happen to him.
Tour guide. Thalisa Martin (who was
the first to notice the strange bread
scent) went upstairs into the room and
the baby crib that is on the floor was
moved.

‘‘I got upstairs and noticed the crib
was moved and then saw it rocking by

 

itself,” said Martin. “That tour was cut
short.  I don’t go into that room unless
I have to now."

Cathedral workers aren’t the only
ones who have had experiences with the
supernatural in this room. Dorothie
Marie Maksym, a psychic from New
York, was on a tour one day when she
witnessed an apparition.

“I’m very professional, so I don’t
keep my senses open. But, when the
tour guide said that there were rumors
of ghosts in the room, I opened my
senses to it,” said Maksym.

The rest of the group went upstairs
and she started to feel something.

“I felt a heavy energy, a cold feeling
that usually means that the spirit is sad,"

FROM PAGE I

said Maksym. “I sensed a man in his 30s
-— a medium height German carpenter
that was searching for his wife and five
daughters who had died from aplague.”

Maksym feels her power helped her
to re—unite this man’s family. She said
that while she was sitting there, she felt
other people come into the room —- the
man’s family. '

“I could hear them crying and in my
mind I saw them come together," said
Maksym. “They seemed so happy and
then they were gone.”

Maksym said that when people die,
their spirits often search for lost family
members. “There is no death. We just
have life after life after life -— we make
transitions from one form to another.”

Leaders should worry
about change, not credit

The federal budget deﬁcit is at the lowest that it’s been in 15 years,
making it the relatively lowest deﬁcit of any of the largest industrialized
nations. This is apparently due to a recent unexpected and unexplained
inﬂux of revenue for the treasury according to an article in the New
York Times. '

Now,_ both political parties are trying to take credit for this phe-
nomenon. You will undoubtedly hear soundbites praising President
Clinton for his economic genius in masterrninding this miracle. And
you may also hear that this stunning victory over the mistakes of spend-
ing past is due to a “corrrmon sense Republican Congress.” Our lead-
ers are very concerned with who gets recognition.

But, the fact is: it just doesn’t matter! There’s too much emphasis
these days —— and especially in this election year —- on who’s respon-
sible for what. Everybody wants to take the credit for the good stuff,
passﬂ1eblamefortlrebadsn1tf,andhopeﬂ1atwedon’trealizethat
they’re not really telling us anything about what they will do for us.

Our government is slow-acting when it comes to making big
changes, becaum our leaders are worried about offending people.
That’s why our political debates are so personal and rhetorical, and so
insubstantial. 'Ihat’s why our elections have become popularity con-
tests instead of idealist’s campaigns. 'lhat’s why many people don’t see
much of a difference between the candidates when it’s time to vote, and
they essentially just toss a coin.

But that's not the point; what we’re trying to say goes a lot deep-
er than that. We’re talking about quality leadership.

Ifa good leader is deﬁned by somebody who can put on a good
show, then there’s no problem. Virtually any of the candidates who
make a campaign do that quite well. But if a good leader is one who
actuallyleads,thenperhapsweareinuouble.Ourleadersarefartoo
busy worrying about their own job security to spend much time acui-
ally leading us.

It’s time for our political leaders to get off the crack-high of bold-
ing their offices, grow some big ones, and start making some real tough
decisions. What we really needareleaders who willdo whatthey know
isright,andwhowillbetoobusydoingittocareiftheygetre-elected,
leaderswhowillcaresomuchaboutmakingoursabetternationthat
they won’t even take the time to hit a campaign trail, and leaders who
will start making changes,  of taking credit for them.

Requirements and
strident motivation

“I wish I didn’t have to take
this *#@!/course! It’s just
another lousy requirement!”
Have you heard this before or
said it to yourself? You are
hardly alone. Nobody likes to
be told that you have to take
this, or you have to take that -
especially when you are at a
university trying to exercise
and achieve some intellectual
freedom.

Is it discouraging to see
many half—motivated students
in your class, teachers, and stu-
dents? The answer to that dis-
couragement may, in fact, be
three keys: teacher, text, and
topic. Ever been in class where
you liked all three? For that
class, you studied your hardest
and showed up early every
time. Then again, there were
those classes where teacher,
text, and topic were uninspir-
ing. So you always sat by the
window. I

A good teacher can make
any topic interesting, because
the teacher possesses an emo-
tive spark and a method of

tial highlights of the topic and

the text under study. But just as
all teachers must try to reach
out to their students, so students
should reach out and add life to
their classes. Beyond that, the
emotive spark of education is
really an elusive mix of text,
teacher, student, and topic. I
wish you luck in finding it.

The Pitt News tips
for dating were not
relevant

After reading the Oct. 23
editorial, “Pitt News Gives
Handy Tips to Win the Dating
Game,” I felt these tips were
not relevant to the college
atmosphere. I do not disagree
with what the author said, but I
feel the author did not mention
that there is another “dating
game” being played today.

The “dating game”
described by the author is the
classic ‘SOs-style, family val-
ues, long—term relationship
courtship. I am not denying the
existence of this “game,” but it
is not predominant on this, or
any other, college campus.

These are the ‘90s — times
and the rules have changed. For
the most part, women have
changed. Today’s women are
more independent, aggressive,
and in control of their own
lives. In general, women have
become more forward and
proud of their sexuality. A
woman today is not afraid or
embarrassed to say, “I like sex,
and I want sex.”

Now that men are not the

only aggressor in the “dating
game,” the game has changed.
Now the “game” is more mutu-
al. Because of heavy workloads
and hectic schedules, students
— men and women alike -
have become like heroin
addicts looking for a quick fix
with no strings attached. The
fix being a fulfilling intimate
encounter, and strings being
feelings of guilt and emotional
attachment. Not to say that
there is no emotion, compas-
sion, or caring in today’s “dat—
ing game;” there _is, but the
unnecessary’ B.S. associated
with it has been left out.

I don’t know who the
author is, where he/she is from,
or what kind of world he/she is

"living in, but it is certainly not
this one. For most of the stu-

dents here, this is the first time
they are on their own. For that
reason, this is a time of experi-
mentation with things like
drugs, money, and of course,
sex. What the author has
described would be great if we
lived in a fantasy world like
“Happy Days” where every-
thing is ﬁne and dandy, BUT
WE DON ’T!

Now that the world is ﬁlled
with sexually aggressive men
and women, and drugs like
Rohypnol, what should we do?
Should we all stay home, invest
in inﬂate-a-mates, and feel safe
and guilt—free? NO! We should
play the “game.” But remember
when you play the game, use
your head and, above all else,
use your protection and play
safe.

In a move that utterly shocked me, the University of Pittsburgh actually did something to help
out its Athletics Department.

The hiring of Steve Pederson on Monday will hopefully signal the beginning of renewed suc-
cess for Pitt athletics, especially the football program.

Pederson has a solid background. He served as associate athletics director and director of
Football Operations at Nebraska, the best football factory in the country. While in Lincoln, he
implemented a plan to raise $20 million for renovations. Let’s see if he
can generate interest and cash into the Panther’s sports wallet.

Pederson said during Monday’s press conference that his top prior-
ities would be the center and reﬁlling Pitt Stadium, what a good idea.

Wherever Pederson has gone; Nebraska, Ohio State, orTennessee,
top-notch recruiting classes have followed. While recruiting football
players may be out of the picture when he takes ofﬁce on Dec. 1, hope-
fully he have some input on who comes here.

A couple of weeks ago the candidate list for athletics director was 
at 88. That all ended Monday when Steve Pederson was named the 10th

around the block enough times to know a winner when he sees one. ,

Assistant A.D. at Nebraska for the last two—and-a—half years, he 
had two national championships in football, spurred men’s and 
women’s basketball teams, an other upper level programs.

Ned Scheme

The hiring of Steve Pederson represents something that the Athletics Department needs: sta-
bility. Pederson will allow the Athletics Department to boast that they have a proven winning foot-
ball coach, a proven basketball coach, and an experienced athletic director, as well as a chancellor
ﬂrat is committed to athletics. This stability will be a powerful recruiting tool for all Pitt sports, espe-
cially the primary revenue earners: football and basketball. Before Pederson’s hiring, the A.D.
vacancy left a feeling that there may be serious overhauling of the Athletics Department But
because Pederson was formerly a recruiting coordinator under Johnny
Majors at Tennessee, there is a strong probability that Majors will return
as head coach next season. ’

As the ﬁring of Paul Hackett proved in 1992, it is extremely diﬂi—
cult to recruit following the ﬁring of a head coach. Assuming that
Majors does return next year, he should continue to improve his recruit-

ing class as he has done the last two years. The job history of Pederson
 should also help Pitt’s recruiting. Pederson is only 39, yet has been
 involved in the Athletics Departments at Ohio State, Tennessee, and
' Nebraska, three of the most‘ successful programs in the last 10 years.
Recruiting will additionally be helped if Pederson pushes for badly
needed facility improvements in the Athletics Department, namely a
new Convocation Center and the nearly forgotten 2nd Century Fund.

Marc Rosenberg

‘ With the naming of Steve Pederson as Pitt’s new Athletics
Director on Monday, every hopeless feeling I had for this
school’s athletics program went straight out the window.

Pitt could not have made a better choice in Pederson. The
Panthers didn’t need a big name like Mike Ditka. Moreover,
Pitt athletics made the right choice by not rushing into
things. They went after the important things that are needed
NOW!

Success and experience. Take a look at this guy’s resume:

now he’s off to Idaho to join the rest of the spuds. Good riddance, Oval.

It’s good to see Pederson has such a strong background on the gridiron. He worked under
Majors at Tennessee as a recruiting coordinator and then went to Ohio State in the same capaci-
ty from 1988 to 1991. Maybe all the speculation about Johnny jumping ship can be discarded
now? ’

Men's lacrosse blue after Falcon Cup loss

Molt Townsend

 

The men’s lacrosse team
ended its fall season with a
second place finish at the
Falcon Cup last weekend,
losing 12-4 to Ohio State in
the finals. Pitt ended the fall
season with a 7-5 record.

On Saturday, the
Panthers opened with a 10-3
loss to Grove City. They
then regrouped and won
three straight to reach the
finals. Their wins were over
Kent State, 10-3, host
Bowling Green, 8-5, and
Miami of Ohio, 8-7 in over-
time.

The fall season is pri-
marily a warm-up for the
spring season. It has no
bearing on the play—offs.
Young players gain experi-
ence, and Coach Gary Neff
experiments with different
lineups. The emphasis is not
on winning games, but on
preparation for the longer
and more difficult schedule
of the spring.

“This is the first winning
record I can remember in the
fall season,” said Neff. “This
team busted their butts this

fall, and that will make us a
better team in the spring.”

Two weekends ago, Pitt
traveled to Penn State and
torched them 18-8. They
also beat up on Bloomsburg
8-2.

“We dismantled Penn
State, and we didn’t even
have our best lineup on the
field,” said Neff.

The future for this team
is excellent. They lost only
one starter to graduation and
are returning their entire
defense and midfield. Their
depth is increased by two-
fold. They have a team of 35
compared to last year, when
they barely had a full second
team.

“We have tremendous
potential -to be a serious con-
tender for winning it all,”
said captain John Foris. “We
are a deeper team than last
year. We not only have a lot
of subs, but they’ve got tal-
ent, which is something we
were lacking in past years.”

This is a young team
with only four seniors. cap-
tains Foris, Rob Heaps, and
Pat Shea will lead the team.

“We have a young
offense, and this year the

defense will try and spark
the offense and lead the
team,” said Foris.

The team will face a
tougher schedule at the
beginning of the year in
order to get them ready for
the powerhouses they play at
the end of the year. In the
past, Pitt would demolish
patsy local colleges at the
beginning of the season,
which would build overcon-
fidence in the team.

“We’d get used to
destroying these teams, and
then when we would play
someone better. We couldn’t
believe it when we would
lose,” Foris said. “We will
be better prepared for the
end of the season with this
new schedule, because we
will be tested early in the
season”

Pitt missed the play—offs
by one game last year, and
this year Neff feels Pitt will
make them.

“We have a good nucleus
and good depth,” Neff said.
“Once we get some injured
players back and get every-
one together, we will have
an excellent team on that
field.”

Wednesday, October 30, ‘I996

 

(WBU, WBB, IBC, CBS, AEIOU,
WPTS) which he will be defending on
his foreign road trip. His very ques-
tionable decision over Axl Schultz cost
him the more respectable IBF crown,
forcing a trip to Japan instead of a big-
money date in Vegas with Mike Tyson.

Grimsley, his opponent, is unde-
feated. He’s a former kickboxer. He
has 18 knockouts in 20 professional
fights. He is said to be adjusting well
to the no—kicks style of prizefighting.

Of course, nobody”s ever really
seen him fight. Grimsley has all the
name recognition of former
Philadelphia Phillies’ pitcher Jason
Grimsley. Foreman’s promoters seem
to be working from the Peter
McNeeley formula —— when in need of
an easy opponent, find a white guy
with a- good record who hasn’t fought
anybody with any talent.

Speaking of no talent, check out
the featured bout on the undercard. In
one corner, wearing the green trunks
with white trim, the NFL’s best sack
dancer in history, Mark Gastineau. In
the other, wearing the blue trunks with
silver stars, Emmitt Smith’s most
famous backup, Alonzo Highsmith.

This is true —— nobody could ever
make something like this up.
Gastineau ﬁghts like a hurricane; he
comes out ﬂailing all over the place in
the first round, then downgrades into a
depression for the rest of the fight.

Tl-IE PITT NEWS

Highsmith only has about 10 pro fights
under his belt, but don’t look for him to
surpass former Cowboy Ed “Too Tall”
Jones in terms of boxing ability.

Apparently, a battle of two ex-NFL
greats (make that “goods”) is the best
thing promoters can come up with if
Butterbean isn’t available. Sad, isn’t
it?

One final jab at the whole
Foreman-Grimsley experience -—— the
card was originally scheduled for Sept.
15 but had to be moved due to sched-
uling problems. It seems the date con-
ﬂicted with a World Wrestling
Federation “In Your House” pay—per-
view special which the promoters
assumed would take away much of the
fight’s audience. That says something.

Back in the world of real boxing,
ring fans have a short turnaround

before they double their cable bill. On V

Nov. 9, Tyson and Holyfield go to war
in a card being billed by King
Promotions as “Finally.” As in,
“Finally, Tyson is going to fight some-
body not made out of paper mache.”
A more appropriate title would

have been, “Why in hell didn’t these ‘

two guys fight four years ago?” Their
original bout, set to be the richest pay-
day in sports history, was cancelled
due to a Tyson training injury. The
makeup bout was ruined when Tyson
decided to play Hide—The-Tiara with
an unwilling beauty pageant contes-

tant. .

Now, Tyson is weaker and less
vicious than his pre-prison days.
Holyfield is slowing down faster than
“Braves 1996 champions” T—shirt
sales. The “Real Deal” has also devel-
oped an unfortunate habit of standing
toe—to-toe with his opponents —— a
strategy that cost him the Riddick
Bowe fight and could explain why
Vegas oddsmakers are calling for an
early-round knockout by Iron Mike.

Even worse, Holyfield is showing
signs that he’s been taking beatings for
a bit too long. Recent interviews show
Evander stumbling over words, slur-
ring his sentences, and staring off into
space with a dull look in his eyes. This
isn’t the same bright—eyed, bulked—up
cruiserweight who beat Buster
Douglas.

But, for the right amount of
money, of course, Holyfield is still
going. And he may shock the world by
taking a rusty Tyson to the limit or

beyond. Problem is, his reward will be

either a fourth match with Bowe, a
rematch with Michael Moorer, or the
dubious honor of defending the title
against Andrew “Low Blows ‘R’ Us”
Golota. Nobody will pay to see that.

They would pay to watch him beat
up Butterbean, though.

“Our hopes are to come out
on top of that heap and to see
what we can do with West
Virginia and Connecticut,” said
Pitt Coach Dave Sobal.

“It will be difficult for any-
one not on those top teams to
break into the top 15. What will
be interesting is 15th to 30th
place. We would like to place
three people there.”

There is a similar division
between the best and the rest for
the men. Eighth-ranked
Providence, No. 1] Notre Dame,
No. 13 Georgetown,’ and No. 25
Villanova will battle for the
championship. Boston College,
West Virginia, Syracuse, and Pitt
should contend for the next
spots.

Individually, the men’s race
should be more wide open than
the women’s. The top 15 runners
in each race earn all—conference
honors. Ed Adamson is the most
likely of Pitt’s runners to earn
such an honor.

“Only a handful of people
will be thinking of winning the
race. Some people will try who
have no business being there, and
they’ll hurt themselves,” Sobal
said. “Not many people have fin-
ished ahead of Ed this year. If he
runs intelligently, he has a solid
shot at the top 15.” '
