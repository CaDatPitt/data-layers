Police: two women raped in dorm
Both signed the alleged assailants into Lothrop Hall before attacks

Hal Turner

Staff Wrlter

Two separate acquaintance rapes
occurred in Lothrop Hall late Friday night
after each woman signed her alleged assailant
into the donn and took him to her room.

One woman, who told police she was
raped at 12:20 am. Saturday, identiﬁed her
attacker as Kevin Starke, 27, of Deerﬁeld, Ill,
and pressed charges against him.

The other woman said she was raped at
11:40 pm. Friday and gave the assailant's
name to Pitt Police, according to Deputy Chief

Gary Moses. She has not pressed charges, so
police have not arrested him

Although police refused to say whether
the unnamed suspect is a Pitt student, Moses
said he didn’t want anyone to be alarmed
Because the woman signed her assailant into
Lothrop Hall, he isn’t “the type” to sneak into
a dorm and rape again, Moses added.

Moses refused to say if the man knows
that the woman has accused him of rape.

Moses said that two acquaintance rapes
occurring in Lothrop Hall on the same night is
coincidence.

Sources close to the woman who accused

Starke said she met him at an Oakland bar.
They then left the bar and the woman took
Starke to Lothrop Hall where she signed him
into the guest log.

The two then proceeded to her room,
where she said he attacked her, according to
police.

Moses refused to say if alcohol was
involved in either rape, but hours after Starke
left Lothrop Hall, city police arrested him for
drrmken driving.

Starke and two friends came to Pittsburgh
possibly to promote a paintball business,

Some fast food ioints trying to
buck the the unhealthy stereotype

BECKY MACGREGOR/GRAPHICS ASSISTANT '

Staff Writer

Most Americans are guilty
of contributing to the infamous
phrase, “Billions and billions
served." But at what cost?

The McDonald’s, Burger

King and Wendy’s signs,
now a part of
American cul-
ture, serve

invitations to thousands of peo-
ple each day. Despite the
expanding awareness of the
downside of fat and calories in
fast food, business is booming.
Dr. Arlene Caggiula, direc-
tor of the nutrition department at
Pitt, realizes the negative affects
of fast food but admits, "I don't
subscribe to social resliictions,
I'm not a big fan of being the
nutritional police." She added,
"Most of the food is not healthy,
it is high in fat and sodium as
well."
As a result, fast food is con-

tributing to the collective belt-
loosening of America.

One reason for a pudgy
America may rest in the opinion
that Americans have become
lazy. For some, exercise isn’t
nearly as important as a couch-
sitting game of Sega or a tele-
vised football game.

Another conclusion, and‘

perhaps a stronger argument, is
the diet to which most
Americans sub-

     
  

   
  
 
 

scribe. According to studies
conducted by Eating Well rnag—
azine, one in three Americans
are overweight.

Compared to the high-ﬁber
diets common in China and
Japan, where only 10 to 15 per-
cent of calories consumed are
from fat, American diets are
closer to 35 percent fat.

A McDonald’s Big Mac,
for instance, has 570 calories
and 33 grams of fat, which cor-
relates to 52 percent of the calo-
ries are from fat. . _

When told the fat content of
his Big Mac, Pitt student Mark
Smith sighed and responded
between gulps, “It’s a quick
lunch, plus it doesn’t cost that
much.”

Burger King’s Whopper
carries a whopping 670 calories
and 38 grams of fat. For those
with even the most nagging
appetite, Burger King also
offers the king of the fat—ﬁl1ed,
fast food‘ sandwiches, the
Double Whopper with cheese,
which at 980 calories, repre-
sents nearly half the average
recommended daily calorie
intake of 2,000.

Tony Zimmerman, one of next year’s
probable starting quarterbacks, was
involved in a Sunday morning scuffle at a
North Versailles all-night eatery.

The Trafford, Pa., native was
arraigned and released on his own recog-
nizance, and so far has been the only per-
son charged in the incident. ‘

The red-shirt sophomore was indeﬁ-
nitely suspended by Head Football Coach
Walt Harris after this weekend’s incident.

Ron Wahl, assistant athletics director
for media relations, would not elaborate
on Sunday’s incident. "

“All we have to say is that he has
been suspended from the team pending

0 legal proceedings,” Wahl said. “We don’t

know when those proceedings will take
place.” . r
Zimmennan retumed to Oakland and
attended classes, but when asked about
what happened this weekend, he declined
to comment. A

This is the third police-related inci-
dent involving the football team this
school year. In October, tight end Kirk
McMullen allegedly punched two Pitt stu-
dents at a fratemity party on Halloween.
That same week, freshman defensive
back Victor Strader threatened to shoot a
California University football player and
harassed three other members of the team.

Last year's winners of the Lothrop Challenge (Tower C) present a plaque to

this year's winners (Forbes Hall) at a ceremony inwthe Kurlzman Room.

Lothrop Challenge raises
record amount for charities 

Monica Mayk
Staff Writer

Students who helped count the
Penny Wars pennies for Lothrop
Challenge said they don't want to
count another copper Abe Lincoln
ever again. _

But after the $4,005 success of
this year's challenge, and the upward
trend in student donations, they didn't
seem to mind so much at Sunday
night's First Annual Lothrop
Challenge Recognition night.

Megan Kuhn, last semester's co-
president of the Forbes Quad RSA,
said that $4,005 "raised by a group of
so-called apathetic students is in my
mind not apathetic at all."

Light ﬂickered from tall white
candles garnished with ribbons and
potpourri in the center of tables in the
William Pitt Union's Kurtzman Room
at the recognition event. The room
buzzed with. excitement as the stu-
dents, resident directors, and charity
representatives anxiously waited to
hear which residence hall raised the
most money for Lothrop Challenge,
an event sponsored by Lothrop Hall
that pits residence halls against each
other to raise money for charity.

Representatives from each RSA
spoke brieﬂy about why and how they
chose their charity and how much
their halls raised.

"Most of us only live here part of
the year, and so the community
assumes we don't care," said Devon
Monroe, Lothrop Hall ‘vice president.
"This gives the Pitt community the
chance to interact with the Pittsburgh
community." - '

The winner of the challenge is
determined by dividing the total
money raised by each hall by the num-

ber of students living there. As it turns 
out, Sutherland brought in the most ;
money, but based on the ratio of stu- .
dents to the amount of money they ;
donated, Forbes Hall won the chal— 3.
lenge by raising $449.95 with 240 res-
idents for Family House.

Tower A raised $246.15 for the 1
Kevin Cecil Fund. Tower B donated 5'
$451.65 to Special Olympics of 
Allegheny County. Tower C raisedf
$289.50 for the Make-A-Wishi
Foundation. Lothrop Ha1l_donated its 3
total of $193.00 to the Hand-in-Hand
Festival. ‘

The largest amounts of doughi
came from residence halls raising;
money for the family of Grantg
Ostendorf. Sutherland Hall students‘;
donated $1,273.19, the Quad raisedi
$344.55 and Holland and Amos Halls
brought in $757.53. ‘ it

Protect yourself
from sexual assault

Two students were raped last weekend, and both
incidents could have been avoided if the victims had
not invited their attackers into their homes.

College means a time of freedom for most stu-
dents. Often, it means our first time on our own,
responsible for ourselves, answerable to nobody.

Unfortunately, that freedom can sometimes lead to
carelessness. '

And carelessness can lead to pain.

Before we go any farther, let’s make something
clear: Nobody blames the victims who were forcibly
assaulted. " ’

But there are precautions you can take — like
thinking twice before you take somebody home —— to
help protect yourself.

Many college ‘students like to experiment with
drugs, alcohol and sex. That’s pretty much expected
when one leaves for college.

But look out for yourself.

Most sexual assaults, especially. those among col-
lege students, are acquaintance rapes. Somebody you
know gets the wrong message, or perhaps you give the
wrong message, thinking it’s just fun to ﬂirt, and the
next thing you know, everything is terribly wrong.

Don’t knowingly put yourself in these situations.
Don’t push the limits if you’re not ready.

Don’t be too trusting of people you don’t know
very well. _

Remember this: Rape is not a crime of passion.
Rape is a crime of violence.

It is possibly the most violent act anybody can
commit. It is certainly the most violent thing anyone
can experience. ‘

Remember. that if you ever must decide whether to
press charges against a rapist. Think of how much it

 hurt. Think of him doing it again, to you or to some-

body else.
Again, nobody wants to blame the victims for

what happened to them. Just like nobody wants to‘

blame the victims of muggers. But they will say to
avoid the dark alleys, just the same. .

' And look out for your friends. When you’re out
drinking with your roommate, and she snags a cute
guy and starts talking about taking him home, don’t be
afraid to ask her discreetly if she’s sure that’s what she
wants to do. That’s not out-of-line, especially if she’s
about to make a huge mistake.

Inﬁeld

I “It’s no fun having kids tell
you your dad stinks.”

No, that’s not a quote from
Chelsea Clinton, although it
would hardly be surprising to
hear a similar report out of
Stanford in the next few days.
That statement was made by the
daughter of another accused
man, another man who denied
the allegations against him even
while the evidence piled up. A
man who stood in the White
House the last time so many.
cries of impeachment and per-
jury were heard. A man who, it

was revealed, had lied to the V

American public.

You got it yet?

That statement came out of
Julie Nixon’s mouth. It echoes
the disappointment of many lib-
eral Democrats, maybe not
staunch Clinton supporters, but
those who up to this point have
been willing to defend him. We
recognized he was not perfect,
but we admired him for his

—“ accomplishments.

What we most resent
Clinton for is the suggestion of
something we can’t defend.
What we most resent is the
uproar of the nation that should
be focused on social problems
instead of tabloid scandals. An
uproar that seemed more pure
25 years ago. Right now the
Clinton bashers and/or
Republicans ‘are sticking their
tongues out at-liberals, and
there’s only one thing we can
do: whine: “But he’s doing a

good job ...”

It’s not fun having someone
tell you your dad stinks. '

It’s worse when that person
is your mom. Fortunately, that is
not a problem in this case.
Herself widely criticized,
Hillary Clinton has decided to
demonstrate just what family
values are all about. Forgive her
the attack on the right wing in
doing so — aren’t we all con-
spiracy-loving Americans here?-

. Whatever is going on
between the Clintons in private
(and there isn’t much left pri-

vate in their lives), Hillary

Clinton is the picture of strength
in public. Remember, she for-
gave him for Gennifer Flowers.
For all the reasons people get
divorced these days, irreconcil-
able differences being among
the most common, a cheating
spouse seems almost a legiti-
mate reason to do so.. While
divorcing a husband when he is
in the Oval Office isn’t the most
likely course of action for a
woman ' scorned to take, Mrs.
Clinton shows a lot of dignity in
not behaving as a woman
scorned at this important time.
She shows dignity in her sup-
port that goes Abeyondthe false
obliviousness of former 1 first
wives.

Does standing by her man
make Mrs. Clinton less of a ‘90s
woman? No. She suggests that a

rnistake, however horrible, is

forgivable, even when not con-
donable, and that trust and the
re-establishment of broken trust

is fundamental between hus- '

band and wife. It means that

THE PITT NEWS

while President Clinton may or
may not have respect for the
institution of marriage, his wife
certainly does. And that is
"something at which neither Ken
Starr nor “family values”-advo-
cates Newt Gingrich and_ Dan
Quayle cannot scoff.

If the president is guilty of
the things he is accused of, and
that is still an if, he will have a
lot of disappointed and angry
Americans to answer to, his
supporters standing first in line.

That is, if he is guilty of perjury. «

Individuals can form separate
opinions of philandering. It is
unfortunate that there are
women who use sex to achieve a
sense of power and men who
use sex to demonstrate a sense
of power. But there are prob-
lems that this country faces —
such as Saddam Hussein — that
are - worse than Monica
Lewinsky and Paula Jones. We
would all do well to stand by
our man. J

Perhaps after his term of
ofﬁce is over, perhaps in pri-
vate, Mrs. Clinton will be
singing a different tune. But for
the moment, her loyaltyis clear,
and my respect is with her. I
think also about Chelsea, who
probably . wonders if her father
had an affair with someone only
six years older than she, and the
strength it must take to be his
daughter right now.

Sex. Violence. Profanity. Adultery.
Incest.

This week’s episode of “Melrose
Place?” Nope. Try “Hamlet” by William
Shakespeare, generally considered to be
one of the great classics of literature.

Recently, I was reading about criti-
cism of the entertainment industry when
the question of what to do about “Hamlet”
occurred to me. Its subject matter, and the
subject matter of numerous other famous
plays, is of a mature nature. Certainly not
suitable for children. But it is considered a
classic and taught in schools across the
country. Howsdo we decide what is litera-
ture and what is pornography? What is
appropriate and what is obscene?

The Supreme Court has repeatedly
struggled with this question and has had
little success. In 1973, for example, the

court deﬁned pornography as something,
which “lacks serious literary, artistic,’ '

political, or scientiﬁc value.” Court rul-
ingsbefore and after have been similarly
vague. j ..
Some critic_s of the entertainment
industry have ignored the Supreme
Cour1:’s ambiguous rulings on the subject
and plunged on to attack Hollywood.
During the last presidential cam-

paign, Sen. Bob Dole went to Hollywood
and attacked. the entertainment industry
for inﬂicting upon the American people
“nightmares of depravity,” declaring, “A
line has been crossed — not just of taste,
but of human dignity and decency 
About a culture business that makes
money from music extolling the pleasures
of raping, torturing and mutilating
women; from songs about killing police-
men and rejecting the law.”

Unfortunately, most criticism of the '

entertainment -industry is useless because
of the ideological bias of those critiquing
the industry. One conservative watchdog
group, for example, praised the_television
show “The Pretender” for having an
uplifting tone but refused to endorse the
show as family friendly.

Why? Did it advocate :anything as ter-
rible as single mothers haying children
without fathers and then going off on their

__own and calling it a lifestyle‘ choice?

Nope. The show, according to the group,

H was anti-farnily because itwas anti-busi-

ness. Apparently, the show had once fea-

' tured .an_episode in whichfthe villain was

a greedy businessman, and teaching chil-
dren that Big Business ought to be
immune from criticism is pro-farnily.
Shows what I know.

Even Dole’s “nightmares of depravi-

V-chips and censors: The poli

  

ty” speech, most of which I did agree
with, loses its moral righteousness when
you consider thefact that it included a ref-
erence to the film True Lies, a very bad
action movie typical of the tripe that
Hollywood puts out today, as being “fam-

ily friendly.” Though I have inﬁnite ‘

respect for director James Cameron, True
Lies was a very bloody ﬁlm that gloriﬁed
violence more than any ﬁlm I’ ve seen
recently. Apparently it ﬁt the deﬁnition of
family friendly because it starred conserv-
ative actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

(Incidentally, for those wishing to see
a Nightmare of Depravity tonight, I sug-
gest going to the local video store and
renting any movie starring Pauly Shore.
Trust me, you’ll want to commit an act of
violence in no time at all.)

It is a shame that critics of the enter-_
tainmerrt industry have such a nakedly
obvious ideological agenda, because I do
believe Hollywood does focus on sex too
often and" gloriﬁes violence.
Unfortunately there is little we can do,
and there is little we should do. Some
ideas that have been offered, such as per-
suading the television networks to volun-
tarily reinstitute the so-called “family
hour” — the time between eight and nine
o’clock when most children generally
watch television with their parents —

strikes me as a good idea. The Clinton
adrninistration’s idea for making the V-
chip, which blocks the television from

showing programs deemed offensive, '

widely available to parents is a wonderful
idea.

What is not such a wonderful idea is
the proposal to have the government reg-
ulate the content of movies, television
shows, and music much the same way it
did during the 1930s and 1940s. These
proposals go well beyond the pale
because it makes the government into the

“thought police,” regulating the thoughts I’
and ideas of the public at large and’
infringing upon of our freedom of speech 1

rights.

In the ﬁnal analysis, it would be a ‘
mistake if we were to overly regulate tele—‘ 
vision content. Excepting things that run-
so obviously against the public good, such? ' 
I as pornographic movies and gratuitously ‘

violent ﬁlms, people should have the right
to say and do what they choose. It would

make the government into, at best, what‘ -
‘Margaret Thatcher called the “narmy ‘

state,”.and, at worst, into a “1984”-like

dictatorship where people don’t have the

right to think and do what they want.

Michael J. Berquist thinks people should g 
have the right to watch what they want. ‘i 

A free market
for kidneys

It was with a mixture of profound
sadness and disgust that I read Elaine
Clifford’s story about the national organ
shortage (Pitt News, Jan. 26). Sadness for
those who are sick and dying; disgust for
the U.S. Congress.

On the one hand, it’s terribly tragic
that 10 people die each day waiting for
organs while, according to a quick calcu-
lation from Ms. Clifford’s ﬁgures, almost
19 suitable donors die each day and take
their organs with them.

On the other hand, it’s disgusting that
this problem is all caused by our own
well—intentioned but hopelessly ignorant
government officials.

Federal legislators, in the 1984
National Organ Transplantation Act,
made it illegal for people to receive
money for their own organs, even if
they’re to be harvested only after death.
Their desire was to prevent poor people
from selling a kidney while still alive and
thus endangering their future health. But
their sweeping legislation also prohibited
people from selling the ﬁiture rights to
their organs, effectively choking off any
possibility that a free market could devel-
op to handle the demand for human
organs.

I envision a system where healthy
people would receive either a lump sum

payment for the future rights to harvest
their organs, once deceased, or yearly
payments contingent upon their maintain-
ing good health.

Ms. Clifford quotes two Pitt students
who are committed to being organ
donors, but who are afraid that emergency
medical personnel would be less likely to
save them if they knew they were donors
and someone “important” were waiting
for an organ. She also quotes a UPMC
transplant surgeon as saying their fear
was unfounded, but understandable.

A free market for organs would elim-'

inate such fears by eliminating the short-

age. Being offered cold hard cash, up 
front, to “do the right thing” would be just,
the incentive to get many folks to sell tire?‘
rights to harvest their organs upon death."

And the increased supply would end the
fears that they’ll be sacriﬁced for the likes
of some wealthy oil sheik or powerful
politician (like former Gov. Bob Casey).
More importantly, people wouldn’t die
for lack of organs.

Now we’ve got PennDOT and the
IRS sending us organ donor cards.
President Ronald Reagan may not have
walked the walk, but his talk was right on
the money: Government isn’t the solu-
tion, it’s the problem. "

Panther gymnasts score

Christine M. Coates
Staff Writer

This past Saturday, the women’s
gymnastics team traveled to
Harrisonburg, Va.,' to met James
Madison and Rutgers in its first
away meet of the year.

The gymnasts headed into the
meet 2-1 and hoping to get some
revenge for last year’s disappoint-
ing loss against Rutgers.

Revenge is exactly what they
got. Pitt won the met with a score of
187.925, outpacing Rutgers’
185.250-point finish and James
Madison’s 182.125 final. Even the
pre-meet action went the Panthers’
way.

“This was one of the best warm-
ups we’ve had at an away meet,”
said Coach Debbie Yohman, adding
that if the judges were judging
warm-ups, Pitt would have won
before the meet even started.

Once the meet did start, the
gymnasts, were in for a long day.
They were in._the gym for a little
over seven hours, finally finishing

,with the balance beam. Although

this squad holds the school balance
beam record, the Panthers showed
their exhaustion in the event with a
number_ of falls.

The team’s best two events were
the floor exercise and vault. The
Panthers received their best team
scores of the day with a 47.5 in
each.

Lisa Fronhofer and Pamela
Lieberman were the top vaulters for

two wms In marathon meet

the Lady Panthers, leading the team
in its victory. They had scores of 9.6
and 9.5, placing first and third in the
event, respectively. ‘

“It’s great to go away and beat
the home team,” said Fronhofer.

-Strong on the ﬂoor for the third
weekend in a row was Pitt’s Calli
Bodnar. She has been leading the
team in this event. Bodnar’s score
was a 9.7 this weekend —— good
enough for a first-place finish.

The gymnastics team will be
headed away again this weekend,
traveling to the Cat Classic at the
University of Missouri.

In the past, the team has had
some difficulties in its away meets.
“Emotionally, we wouldn’t be
warming up like we should be at
away meets,” said Yohman.

The Cat Classic will be "a chal-
lenge for the team, according to the
coach. The Classic is a meet con-
sisting of four to six teams that have

a feline as a mascot. This year’s par- .

ticipating teams are Penn State,
Missouri and Pitt.

The “stray eat” this year is Iowa
State. —It is the stray cat because its

mascot — a cyclone — is not a

feline.

Pitt’s gymnasts have already
battled one of their upcoming feline
challengers — they defeated

Missouri at home two weekends

ago, 190.1 to 188.1. It was an excit-
ing met that involved the record-
breaking beam performance.

The Cat Classic is this weekend,
Feb. 6-7.

“In my opinion, he will be much
better served by staying in school and
continuing to grow,” said Willard.

But all Blount thought of was
growing financially.

His ‘career in the NBA lasted only_

a couple of weeks into the’NBA’s pre-
season camp. After being drafted 55th
(of 58) by the Seattle Supersonics, he
was released on Oct. 7. -

Later that month, the 20-year-old
was drafted in the fifth round by the
Grand Rapids Hoops of the
Continental Basketball Association.
He signed for just a couple of thousand
dollars a month —— not what he had
envisioned — and by the new year
Blount was out of the league.

about the situation. I did what was best for
me.”

FROM PAGE 7

Purifoy was impressed with Pitt’s
play last year. “Week in and week out, Pitt
played hard, and tl1at’s what I like to see.,”
he said.

A year ago, Purifoy wouldn’t have

p chosen Pitt, but he said the team’s turn

around was a big factor in his decision
along with the closeness of his family to
the Pittsburgh area.

“I’m looking to be an impact player
next year. Pitt has a very good recruiting
class, and I’m glad to be a part of it,”
Puiifoy said.

Purifoy, a 6—foot—2, 220—pound line-
backer/fullback, was first team all-state.
He runs a 4.6—second 40-yard dash, which
is very quick for someone his size.

Grades won’t be a problem for the
star recruit. Purifoy earned a 3.0 grade
point average at Steel Valley High School.

Steel Valley Head Coach Ed Wehrer
had a lot of praise for Purifoy. “I think he’s
going to be an immediate impact at Pitt.
He’s a self—motivator. We coach that style
of football player here at Steel Valley.”

Wehrer said he tried to make sure
Arnir was considering the right things for
his decision.

“We think Pitt can say they have the
best offensive and defensive recruits in
western Pennsylvania,” Wehrer said of
Wﬂliarns and Purifoy.

_ In addition to Purifoy, the Panthers
have received commitments from two
more players from Saddleback Junior
College in California.

Brad Baker, a 6-foot-2, 300—pound _

offensive lineman, has committed to Pitt.
Baker bolsters arecruiting class that now
has six 300—pound lineman. Amazingly,
Baker has been timed at 5.0 seconds in the
40-yard dash, an unheard of time for a
lineman of that size.

Ryan Brock also has given Pitt a ver-
bal commitment. Brock is a 6—foot—5, 260-
pound lineman also from Saddleback
Junior College. .

No one is really sure where he is
now. .
He just disappeared.

But the point of this fodder is not
to berate Blount for leaving school
early. He saw a dream coming true,
and with the wrong people feeding
him advice, he acted on it. He is a vic-
tim of the college basketball system
just like thousands of athletes. are
every year. They get recruited to

. schools halfway across the country for

a so-called education. But the demands
put on these 18-year-olds to win and
play well are too great to encourage
any kind of academic atmosphere.

A recent NCAA study said of the
960 Division-I college basketball play-
ers polled, only one in five will ever
graduate. This means 768 (80 percent)
will end their college experience with-

out a degree. _

And of these, only about 40 per-
cent will make it to the pros for any
length of time. This leaves 728 men
(75 percent) without a college degree
or a pro career.

This study and other examples like
it are among the reasons the NCAA
toys with the idea of giving college
students some kind of an allowance to
help keep the student athletes in
school.

Right now, they aren’t allowed to
have part-time jobs, and many of the
big-time college athletes come from
low-income families where spending
money is a myth.

It just doesn’t make sense.

College athletics rakes in millions .

of dollars each year for schools
through television contracts, apparel
and sponsorships. The athletes don’t
see a penny of it, and this has created

an economic incentive for cheating"

that persists in college athletics (i.e.,
Curtis Enis and his new blue suit).

Yes, it is true that a person should

Mark Blount did. Or, at least he

couple bad bounces, and it seemed
that nothing was going right.”

But it wasn’t just the unconverted
power-play attempts that had the
Panthers reeling — it was the speed
and the aggressiveness of the Dukes
that wore the Panthers down.
Aggressiveness in particular almost
cost the Panthers one of their steadi~
est defensemen.

Dave Konn received a 10-minute
misconduct at 11:37 of the second
period when he was speared by a
Duquesne player. Although the refer-
ee should have seen the provocation,
he did not call a penalty and Konn
attempted to dispute it. _

“The referee kind of had it in for
me since I was in high school,” said

Konn, who was team captain at Mt. _

Lebanon High School last season. “It
was a build—up from then, this entire
season and the. entire game. I had
tried to talk ‘to him about the calls
earlier in the game but he told me not
to contradict him. When the ref didn’t
call the spear, I just went nuts.”

Although Chouinard reprimanded
Konn after the defenseman’s out-
burst, he was more understanding
after the contest. '

“Your adrenaline is running high
and the emotions are running high,
and when certain incidents happen,
people seem to lose their cool,”
Chouinard said. “I think Dave lost his
cool. Fortunately he wasn’t thrown
from the game and he got the 10-
minute misconduct, but he returned
to the game and realized his mis-
take.” ‘ - 1'

But Konn’s near-ejection was the
least of Pitt’s concerns. Keeping the
game close was the issue at hand.

Tuesday, 3 February 1998

FROM PAGE 7

The Dukes jumped out to a 2-0
lead in the first seven minutes of the
first period, on goals by Kevin Check
and Denny Browne. Pitt rallied on a
shorthanded goal by Jake Polochak.
After another Duquesne shot sneaked
by Pitt goalie Dave Ciarletta, Panther
Dan Lenza scored his sixth goal of
the season to put _the game at 3-2.

Although Pitt held on to the one-
goal deficit for a better part of the
second period, Duquesne outmuscled
and intimidated Pitt. Konn’s near-
ejection and penalties to him and
Lenza midway through the third peri-
od broke the Panthers’ backs. V

The Dukes went on an offensive,

tear, as Browne scored three goals in
four minutes to send Ciarletta to the

bench.‘ Patrick Kenny, who was sup-'

posed to have the nightvoff, came in
after the fifth goal and surrendered

- three more late in the final period.

“The third period, it was just a
letdown,” Ciarletta said. “We let by
shorthanded breakaways a couple
times and you can’t do that. I think
overall I played a strong game, but
the game might have been a lot dif-
ferent if we had come out strong.”

Pitt’s seasonal record drops to 2-
13, and Chouinard has just one goal
in mind for the rest of the year.
