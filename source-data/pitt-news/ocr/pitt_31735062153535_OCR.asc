Carnegie Tech can boast of little
achievement against the athletic prow-
ess of her Blue and Gold rivals in the
contests of the fall and winter season.
Pitt’s second basketball victory’ over
the Plaid contingent Saturday evening

the Tech football’ team last fall con-
cluded a_ triple triumph for the Uni-
versity athletes, while the Plaid hus-
Lkies were unable, to register a single
Win. L U  ' L L

Lcular. array of talent over to the Tech
cage for the return elngagement of the
ba.skLetbalUl season and just to” show
the Plaidhurlers that Ltheirformer de-
gfeat at Pitts hands was not the result
of a ﬂash in ‘form, the = Pittites con-
L.guerLed the foe in much the same fash-
