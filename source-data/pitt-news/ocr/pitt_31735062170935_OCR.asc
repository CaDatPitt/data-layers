statements from the three Demo-
cratic mayoral candidates. Wed-
nesday. candidates for judge and
jury commissioner spoke.

Incumbent Mayor Peter F. Flah-
erty spoke first, claiming he
would “run on his record.” He
proceeded to list what he refer-
red to as “the accomplishments
of my administration.”

The Mayor explained that he

took "a hard. austere approach to
preserve the tax, base and suc-

ceeded in lowering real estate

taxes and eliminating the city’s
wage tax.“

Flaherty then described‘ his non-
fiscal "accomplishments“ includ-
ing the paving of "32 miles of the
city‘s 1.300 miles of roads and the
opening of the city‘s own asphalt
plant."

When questioned about charges
of the use of “inferior asphalt by
the city,” the Mayor told stu-
dents to “go and look at Forbes
Ave.j’ while maintaining that 99
per cent of the asphalt is fine.”

Flaherty. responding to the is-
sue of University area parking.
insisted that "responsibility for
providing adequate parking rests
with -those who build the build-
ings,"

The next speaker was William
Obricki. former Wallace delegate.
and presently a steelworker. ‘He

’ complained about his "poor press

coverage" in comparison with the
other candidates. Obricki claim-
ed that most articles merely add
"and oh. by the way. Bill Obricki
spoke“ to their lengthy articles on
Caliguiri and Flaherty.

Volunteers to Assist Parole Officers

by MITCH BERRY

The three Students t'or a Dem-
ocratic Society (SDS) members
who were arrested last April for
posting anti-war signs on the
doors of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing will be tried Tuesday. March
27. in the County Courthouse.
downtown. The University is not
pressing charges in the case. but
the arresting officer has refused
to drop charges.

Matt Schneirov and Kathy Linds-
ley. both SDS members and Pitt
students. along with a third mem-
ber who wishes to remain uniden-
titled because he is a Pitt instruc-
tor. were arrested April 27. 1972.
at the Fifth Ave. entrance of the
Cathedral by, Campus Police Of-
ficer Edward Pendergast.

The three individuals had just

finished posting a leaflet denounc--

ing the war and ROTC and were
about to hang another when they
were approached by Pendergast,
who placed the trio under arrest.

According to Schneirov. "All he
said was ‘you're under arrest.’

and he refused to let us go despite '

the fact that we were students."

The three were taken to Police
Station No. 4. Oakland. and_later
that morning were arraigned be-
fore a city magistrate. down-
town. I

In subsequent weeks, the SDS
members were given a prelimin-
ary hearing and brought before
a grand jury to determine if there
was sufficient evidence to hold
the case for court. ~

Juvenile Court approved a plan

The new plan has been dubbed
"Project Probation" and will

The project. explained Reitz. is
being implemented as "a more

effective way to deal with delin-.

quent behavior." He said the high

./rate of recidivism under current

probationary methods sparked a
search for a new approach to the
problem.

Nominee

Frank Lucchino. former district magistrate and present candi-
date for the Democratic city council nomination-. spoke to the Legal

Awareness Committee Wednesday.

Lucchino recently criticized City Court as a “disgrace to the sys-

tem of justice.“

At the LAC meeting, Lucchino maintained that the City Court sys-

tem simply “can’t be resurrected.“ He feels the system should be de-_

centralized. ”

"The cases should be given to the district magistrates elected in
the neighborhoods. because they are more than appointed city magis-
trates. capable of functioning as people of the neighborhoods with an
understanding of the particular people and problems involved.“ Luc-

chino said. ‘ A

vania Penitentiary. "I‘m just one
person." she said. "but maybe I

can help at least one other person

so he doesn't end up in a place
like that."

The volunteers, she said, will be
acting as a “big brother” or “big
sister” to the youth on. parole.

_They will provide a least four‘

hours of companionship each
week and will be “both a friend

A and a guide.”

Matucsak said that probably
the most important asset of the
volunteer will be his function as a
"role model." A youth from a
bad neighborhood generally sees
nothing but bad examples..he- said.
In his "big brother.“ the parolee
may. for the first time-. see an al-
ternative to his delinquent be-
havior and hopefully
himself.

Reitz said that an important
sidelight of the volunteer help
will be an ease on the heavy case
load which now confronts. them.
"In some cases." said Reitz. "if
we spend an hour a month with the
kid. we're lucky.” The project will
also allow more time for "the
hard-core cases. " .

day since the three were first ar-
rested.

In a recent interview. Schneirov‘

voiced their suspicion that "per-
haps the University wants to drop
the charges becasue this is too
much of a political issue and too
unimportant." but Pendergast re‘-'

The students continued, “But, 
maybe the University doesn’t-

really want to drop the charges,

and they are just hiding behind‘

Pendergast.”

According to Alden E. Bowen.
coordinator of the University Stu-
dent Judicial System. however.
the case cannot be dropped. Said

— Bowen, "After the case gets by

the grand jury it is a state case
and cannot be withdrawn-“

Bowen further pointed out that,

Pendergast is bringing suit
against the SDS members. not the
University. "The case is entirely
out of'the University's hands."
Bowen said, again pointing out
that the University and his office
is not. nor ever was. active in the
case.

Bowen admitted that he did not

think that the case, nor the charge , ‘ ‘
brought against the three SDS ,

members, was very serious. A
probated sentence and a possibile
monetary fine were all he thought
the three would recieve if found
guilty.

Bowen did, however. firmly de-
fend Pendergasts right to bring

A Sponsored by the Intercultural

question, "Is There a Black Cul-

implying that teachers should be
taught how to deal with children
so that they do not fall behind
their classmates in learning.

Henderson added that black stu-
dents should follow the rule that
“when you’re out there with them
use their language when it is ap-
propriate.”

Dr. James Kelly. Associate
Dean of the School of Education.
explained black culture through

personal experiences. He has no-
ticed that there is a definite dif-
ference in the way black and white
cultures perceive space. time.
and expression.

Kelly observed that blacks tend
to be more expressive than whites
and also use space differently.

Also Kelly noted. “Blacks per-

ceive time as getting there when

He also contended that there were no young magistrates or wom-
en magistrates presently on city court and feels this is a serious prob-
lem. "There are no magistrates under the age of 50 and the two most
recently appointed by Mayor Flaherty are in their 70’s. The cases
brought before city court, however. involve mostly those under 35

years of age,“ Lucchino explained.

“A 60’or 70 year old magistrate may form an adverse opinion of
a 25 year old with a vastly different life-style,” he said. He recom-
mended the appointment of “people with different points of view” but
was distressed that the “mayor hasn’t done this.”

Lucchino said for two and a half years he sought reform and made
suggestions for improvement of the system. but they fell on deaf ears.
"I felt it was important to speak out on this issue as a magistrate be-

fore declaring my candidacy for the council,“ hesaid.
He concluded by emphasizing the importance of legal groups such

as LAC which "call attention to the problems.“ He urged LAC to'"keep
this (City Court» important issue going“ and commended their role
in "agitating for people to make a change."

Apeople-—no amateur psychologists
he said. He added
that the background of the volun-
teer was very important in match-
ing a youth with someone-‘with
whom he could relate. _

Out of the 40 applications which
were received. six persons were
selected for the pilot program
to begin near the end of March.
Three two.-hour group instruction
sessions will prepare the volun-
teer before he is assigned to work
with a youth.

Reitz said‘the job of the volun-
teer is going to be an “extremely
difficult one. This has got to be
one of the most frustrating jobs in
the world,” he maintained.
“Again and again you’ll fail, but
you’ve got to be patient until that
one time when you really reach a
kid and then you know you’re do-
ing some good.” ’

Reitz said they expected to be-
gin evaluating the pilot program

around July. If the evaluation re- '

veals a lower rate of recidivism
in the’ cases handled by the pro-
ject. the program will be expand-
ed. «eventually. he said. "to en-
compass all juvenile courts."

Obricki’s platform will be
“Jobs, jobs, and more jobs!” He
rejects the skybus proposal as
too expensive, urging support of
special bus-only Pat-ways instead.

Obricki maintained that "zero

the paving done in the last year.
"politically motivated."

Making his third visit to Pitt in
as many months was City Coun-
cilman Richard S. Caliguiri. the
endorsed Democratic mayoral
candidate. ‘ g

Caliguiri called students “this
city’s most important asset” but
was distressed that “young peo-

’ ple aren’t proud of this city.”

He asked. "What's wrong with
saying you‘re from Pittsburgh‘?
You can't be proud of a city that
just maintains the status quo."

in a later reference to Flaherty.
he explained. "Youicant be proud

‘of a city if you're against every-

thing and give no alternatives."
He pledged to “make Pittsburgh
go“ and then outlined his specific
recommendations for “reform
and and restructuring within city
hall."

man entered and said to the shop-

“Yes, sir. You seem to have had

yourself. didn‘t you say that the.

vote of the council was law?" .

“You just can’t always have
complete agreement, and the Ma-
yor will always get a certain
amount of criticism.”

’ "But. as Mayor. don't you have
certain police powers for emer-
gency situations. I can't make
permanent changes here without
consent of council. but as long as
the bridges east of here are out.

. there is an emergency."

“If the one-way streets are an
emergency measure, can you an-
thorize painting lane markers and
changing the timing of the traf-
fic lights?”

“That's a matter for our traf-
fic people."

The Mayor seemed ready to
leave. We were holding up pedes-
trian traffic. He left.

Whilewe were talking, about 10
people greeted the Mayor. Several
of them touched him. Only about
three of these people greeted him
as “Pete.” ‘About. as many said,
“Hi, Mayor.”

He always replied. “Glad to see
you."

any.

will not be present forever, to
guide your steps and encourage
you in what you do best. I no long-

you in those small matters where
you have annoyed me.

 

Go on with your proud burden.

Editor. The Pitt News:

As a visitor and parent to the
Pitt campus. I see a big need for
some litter cans. How about the
art students decorating up some
large usable sturdy cans? Both in
the Towers and the halls there‘s
no place to discard papers. and
no janitors in sight ever.

What is your outlook on this’?
To me "litter" runs a place down.
let's hope Pitt trys a clean up.
Kids will use litter cans if they
are placed where handy.

REMEMBER THE OTHER VETS ?

OH, ALI-R\ GMT-

Thank you for listening. [hate
to see litter of any sort—it means
lazyness and dirtyness to me.
Clean environment is best taught

and shown in the homes and

Please see if you think it‘s wor-
thy of the University of Pittsburgh

to invest in litter cans and somej,s'V‘

tiful asset to the area.

Attention true music lovers. It
is not often that I have the chance
just to out—and-out rave. But as
I sit and write this article I find
I have no choice but to rave. and
the subject of this rave is the
Pittsburgh Chamber Music _So-
ciety. Monday night I had the
pleasure of hearing the New York
Chamber soloists. the fourth con-
cert of this series. But more about
them later.

The Chamber Music Society will
soon finish its 12th season. and.
although I wasn‘t around the pre-
vious 11 _vears. I‘m sure the fu-
ture will hold even more of these

The meeting will be held in

fine musical offerings. Sponsors
of the Society include nearly all
the city colleges. as well as the
Carnegie Institute.

The programs have given Oak-
land a consistently excellent qual--
ity of music at an amazingly low
price—$1;50 per concert. Despite
the low price, the musicians are
not local groups or amateurs, but
internationally known chamber
groups, all professional musicians
and of the highest calibre. How-
ever, the gilded tiersof Carne-
gie Music Hall find themselves
sparsely populated when grants
such as the Czechoslovakian Sme-
tena Quartet from Czechoslava-
kia, the French String Trio, or the
Juilliard Quartet come to town.
Hopefully, the response to this
article will find the closing show
of the season, as well as the next
season’s programs, all sellouts.

In 1969. Davis set up a work-

This has blossomed into a 22
piece band with seven singers.

It’s a together sound with the
rough edges‘ that typify jazz. Da-
vis calls it “dirty,” with a nasty
little chuckle, explaining that di-
rectors clean up the sound and
make it too “smooth.” The en-
semble’s sound has spirit and
character and leaves plenty of
room for improvisation, which
makes every jazz piece refresh-

You couldn’t ask fora better

Association. The two teams that
are considered the best in local
collegiate hockey will meet on
Sunday night at the Alpine Ice

fact that they have had some
trouble. with some teams in the

the first regular season contest.
43.: and then going down again in

age  PITT ‘NEWS--Friday, March 23, 1973

- Icers Face C-MU For Cup

Tournament. 3-1.

Pitt advanced to the finals last
Tuesday by defeating St. Vincent.
3-2. in sudden death overtime.
The Vinnies had only won four

-‘games all season but gave the

skaters their toughest game of
the season. Goalie Andy Labras-
ka faced 61 Pitt shots and put on
an unbelieveable display in the
nets for the Vinnies. __

Carnegie-Mellon also was vic-
torious on Tuesday night and they
had to go into sudden death over-
time to beatlndiana, 3-2. That was
the first time this year that the
Tartans could down the Inidians;
Indiana tied C-MU in their first
meeting, and sent the Tartans
down near the end of the regular
season.

C-MU had a 1_-0 lead after the
first period but Indiana tied things
up by the end of the second. The
Tartans grabbed the lead early in
the third but at the end of regu-
lar time Indiana had knotted it
all up once more. Carnegie-Mel-

lon came through when the chips ’

were down to earn the berth in
the finals.

The Pitt skaters went into the
St. Vincents contest thinking that
it probably would not amount to
much "more than a regular work-
out. The skaters got what they
were looking for but not how they
expected it. Labraska put Pitt
through the strongest skating
session the icers have experienc-
ed in quite a while.

Coach John Finney, Sr. used
only two lines through most of the
third and sudden death periods
and that could be the strategy for

goal for Pitt although the vet-
eran netminder did not have one
of his finer nights against the Vin-
nies. With the pressure on in sud-
den death, Lieberman came
through and his experience of
three years in the Pitt nets will
show when the Cup is on the line.

Lieberman’s counterpart. C-MU
netminder Jeff Hart. had earned
quite a reputation around the
league this year. Hart carried the
Tartan goaltending chores all
year and came through it all with
the lowest goals against the
league.

In front of Hart the Tartans
boast perhaps the quickest team
in either division. and C-MU is
known for the fine positional hock-
ey. Pitt will carry an advantage in
size. and if the Pitt skaters can
avoid the penalty box. that may
be the deciding factor.

Mike Kenworthy, Jim Powers,
and Bob Eastman will pace the
Carnegie-Mellon offense against
the Pitt defense, which will be in
tact. Phil Gefsky sustained a bad
cut over his right eye in the ‘St.
Vincent contest, forcing him to
leave the game in the second per-
iod. Gefsky will no doubt be in
uniform come Sunday, probably
sporting at least a half dozen
stitches.

There will be two buses for any
interested students wishing to
attend the championship game.
The buses will leave from the
Fifth Ave. side of the Student Un-
ion at 7:30 p.m. Sunday. The open-
ing faceoff is scheduled for 8 p.m.
and tickets will be available from
team members on the buses, at

_ the Student Union ticket office or

at the Alpine. WPGH "will broad-

berg handling the play by play.

For those of you who don't know. besides being associate

But as I sit here at the typewriter I'd like to make one point
perfectly clear. Any and all comments that appear under my

berof the Pitt Hockey Club. With that point clearly defined. I

 Pitt can beat Carnegie-Mellon anytime they ‘want to. After
watching both teams play three excellent games so far this
‘season. there's no doubt _in my mind which team is _superior.

l.??"True, Pitt has yet to defeat the Tartans this year but there
are some definite reasons why those games endedas they did.

,9 t‘ C“-MU beat Pitt in their first encounter. 4-3. The reason-
Pitttunderestimated their opponents. Every team that plays
Pitt takes the ice psyched higher than a kite. and C-MU used
that factor in the upset. Another factor was that Pitt goalie
Mark Lieberman did not en_joy a fine night.

-~. The second time around. in the West Penn Tournament at
t_l1eCivic Arena. was a case of two things; C-MU'played bet-
ter «positional hockey but one of the main factors was the line
matchups. Ex-coach Guy Carole used three lines against C-ML"s
two and it definitely made a difference. especially in the third

Dei'iod. _

  Although Pitt’s third _line was not scored upon, they did not
carry much of an offensive threat in the C-MU end. They play-
egdrespectably, but the name of the game is putting the puck in
.th'e.~net.

. The final regular season contest wound up in a ,2-2 "tie.
Thank referee Jim Armstrong for that. True. Pitt does average
a few more penalties per game than the typical WPIHA teafn.
but that is a direct result of their bruising style of play. Arm-
Sfrong will not be in a striped uniform on Sunday night. it's of-

  Season-Successfully

by LYNN HARRIS

The Pitt indoor track season has come to a
close and looking back on it all head coach Jim Ban-
ner feels his athletes did a "great job.". ~

Injuries and flu plagued the team the whole
season starting off with the Eastern State Cham-
pionships formerly known as the Chesterfield Jay-
cees Invitational on January 18. The mile relay
team was scratched with Chuck Mozingo and Rich
Jackson being the only ones left due to the flu. A
makeshift. two mile relay team also came about be-
cause of the flu. taking fourth place. \

Coach Banner was “very pleased with the
team under the conditions." This was the beginning
of a very frustrating but successful season.

The team continued to compete in duel and tri-
angular meets,winning, but at the same time be-
ing hit by the flu and injuries. Then came the
highlight of the Pitt indoor season—the fourth»an-

nual Pittsburgh Invitational. Top tracksters from‘

all over the East came to compete in this exciting
weekend started by Banner four years ago.

Concentrating on the three relay teams. Pitt
came in with two out of three first places. The dis-
tance medley consisting of Jack Patrick. Ted Bob-
by. Nick Martin. and Bob Steele took first with a
time of 10:08.1. Pitt's two mile relay team of Ken
Silay. Rich Markley. Tom Moorefand Bob Steele
also took honors by winning. time 7:46.l. The mile
relay team took second.

Individually Bill Rea won the long jump. his
speciality. easily; John Black took runner up honors
for Pitt in the 1000 yard run behind Rick Kiss-
man of Kentucky. Three Field House records-were
broken at this special weekend but none by Pitt
athletes.

Continuing to win in duel and triangular meets
Pitt moved on to the Michigan State Invitational.
Bill Rea broke 3,-Michigan State Field House record
and meet record by jumping 25.65. Roosevelt Ran-
dall posting his “personal best” at that point in the
season, placed second in the triple jump from a 49.3.

These two athletes were the only shining moments .
for Pitt. The distance medley finished oout of the V
‘ running and the mile relay finished fifth with a

3:195.

The mile relay was in with some of the best
competition in the Midwest. including Michigan
State. Eastern Michigan. and Nebraska.

Overall Assistant Coach Don Mollenhauer was
"somewhat disappointed." Moving on with duel
meets as a means of preparing for post season com-
petition on Feb. 23 and 24. Pitt saw action at both
Madison Square Garden and Ohio State.

Bill Rea, All-American and Olympic alternate,
placed third in the long jump at the National AAU’s.

.Rea did exceptionally well, measuring 25.5‘/2. His
* competition was outstanding,

‘ including Olypic
champion Randy Williams and world standout Norm
Tate.

A’t Ohio State the distance medley took third

_ with a 10.13. Individual standouts include Roose-

velt Randall. placing fourth in the triple jump. and
Tim Riley taking third in the high jump.

At the IC4A's in Princeton. N. J.. on March 3
and 4. Pitt took fourth place. Bill Rea won the 10mg
jump for the second straight year in a row. leaping

25.34. Tim Riley took third in /the high jump with a‘

6.9. This was the biggest surprise of the IC's. The
distance medley was disqualified from the finals
due to a Princeton runner‘_s claim that anchor man
Bob Steele interfered with his ability to pass. Pitt
appealed but the ruling stood. This was a tough
break for Pitt.

Ending the season with the NCAA’s in Detroit,
Bill Rea and the two mile relay team consisting of
Ken Silay, Rich Markley, Bob Steele, and Rich
Jackson had a ‘fine showing. Rea came in third,
xehind Randy Williams and Al Lanier, to become an
All-American again. The two mile relay team took
fourth, coming in with at 1251.4.

Banner described the weekend as "fantastic."

Now at the end of the indoor season with ‘the
outdoor season to begin on April 7. Banner feels "all

the athletes progressed .and he issatisfied with the A

indoor season.

Bound for NCAA ’s

by YAIER LEHRER

The 1972-73 swim season is over
now for everyone except for -two
members of the Pitt swim team
who are competing at _,the NCAA
championship at the L'niversity
of Tennessee.

Mark Wallace and Jeff Miller
are competing/against the best
swimmers in the country in an
effort to. leave their mark on the
collegiate swimming scene.

"I feel confident about this
meet." said Miller. "I was hitting
my dives -real well during the

‘liasterns and I'm also more re-

laxed than I have been all year."

Miller will be diving in the one-

L

  Final Rematch

Fame Invitational Meet in which
he finished sixth in a field of about
45 divers.

"I just hope I can finish in the
top 12 in my event." commented
Wallace.

The top 12 swimmers in any one
event at the NCAA‘s are declared
All-Americans. Wallace's time
of 53.1 in the consolation finals in
the’ 100—yard backstroke was the
sixth or seventh fastest recorded
time this year. ’

‘‘I’ll have to go under 53.0 flat in
order to place high in this meet,”
he said. “All the swimmers get
especially pysched up for_ this
race and everyone’s times are
generally improved during the
meet.”

Both Wallace and Miller are

The three~meter divers for Pitt.
Jeff Miller and Jack Garrow were
undefeated on the three-meter
board since the first meet of the
season when Tony Camille of
Temple grabbed first place.

“I feel that I can do better at
Tennessee than I did at the East-
ernsfespecially in the pre-lims,”
commented Wallace. “They had
me swimming the pre-lims in the
morning and my body doesn’t
start to function right until about
three in the afternoon.”

He did manage to make it into
the consolation finals. though and
there did a better time than in the
"big finals“ but could not be
awarded the Eastern champion-
ship because of his earlier per-
formance.

"I'll be happy to finish above
the first cut at 32 divers." said
Miller. “Once I do that. 1 know I
belong with the best divers in the
country.“ \

Although he did not qualify for
the finals in the Easterns, Jeff
will be looking forward to this
meet more than any other.

“It's a real honor to -be able to
go to the l\'CAA‘s and if I do well
there it will be a great thrill for.

Both members of the swim team
will have a chance to show their

, Al Sylanski is anxiously await-
L ing the start of this springs base-
 ,,baIl season. After compiling a 2-0

1' record as a freshman and a 6-2
slate in his sophomore year; he
-was used only sparingly in relief
last season due to arm trouble.
This year he is out to prove him-
 self.
....T"l‘he senior’ hurler hails from
’ Fort Cherr_v High School where he
 ‘compiled a respectable 15-5 won-
"glost record over three years.
Sylanski augmented his high
school experience by pitching in
-t/he summers for the Little Pi-

;?Pittsburgh areas‘ most talented
 high school baseball players.

   
   
 
    
  
   
   
   
  
  
   
     
     
     
      

 The senior hurler expresses a
. great deal of optimism toward the
_§:l’upcoming season. With 15 return

well be justified. In the presence
“of so much experience. Sylanski

all positions with plenty of depth.

Mound Rebound

To Try

vious year’s squad was Mike
Nichols.

While the loss of Nichols will
hurt. the addition of a talented
crop of freshman should add
some depth to the staff. Needless
to say. Sylanski figures to be a
valuable performer. .

The big question for the Mounds-
man. however. is how well his
arm‘ will hold up throughout the
upcoming season. For the past
two and one-half weeks. the team
has been working out in the stadi-
um when the inclimate weather
has not driven the practice ses-
sions indoors.

Throughout this time, Sylanski
has been giving his arm strenuous
test. And at this point, he is "very
pleased with the way it feels.‘ This
being his last year at Pitt, he is
determined to make a good show-
ing.

Feeling certain that once he
can become involved in a few
game situations and regain some
confidence in his arm. Sylanski
just might make his last year at
Pitt one to remember.

Dear Sports Editor.

Realizing that the Pitt News
gives the students of the Univer-
sity the opportunity to read and
give responsible opinions on all
issues. I feel it is my privilege to
speak out on the comments of
Vince DiNardo and Timothy Pa-
trick Gorman. Jr.

First. I believe’ that Notre
Dame was definitely good enough
to have been awarded a spot in
the NIT. Backing up this opinion
are the following facts: Notre
Dame. as rated by one magazine.
pla-yed the toughest schedule in

the country this year. Included:
were South Carolina. Ohio State.
Fordham. and Duquesne at the

Civic Arena. No one could possi-

bly argue against that being a.

great schedule. In fact. Notre
Dame was the only team outside
of the Pacific Eight to play UCLA
twice. And to that a 14-11 win-
loss record. with victories in the
last five games.

Vince. was it a slap in the face
to have Fairfield (who did they
play this year?) and Rutgers
(trounced-by 20 at Pitt this year)
selected for the tournament. Af-
ter all, the NIT must fill 16 spots.

More ND NIT Notes

I would also like to take issue
with Tim Gorman’s letter. The
last time Notre Dame turned
down a bowl bid was a year-and-
a-half ago, not three or four years.
Also, could he substantiate his
cliam as to where the funds for
the game would go. I doubt it.

His claim that Notre Dame is a
‘iracist institution" is complete-
ly irresponsible. Gorman stated
that Notre Dame could not afford
to have a black quarterback on na-
tional television. However. Brown
started his sophomore yearover
three white quarterbacks. and
played the whole game when they
were trounced by both Southern
Cal and LUS, the LSU game be-
ing on national television. Iitlis
my contention that when it comes
to quarterbacks. Torn Clements

. is far superior to Cliff Brown.

In closing. I would like to say
just one more thing. Notre Dame

‘ did not run up the score in the

Pitt football game last year. Yes.
