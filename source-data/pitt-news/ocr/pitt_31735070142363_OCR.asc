Students don’t want to pay ‘Fair Share’

College students meet city councihnen to discuss options to Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s tax on students

John Manganaro
For The Pitt News

City councilman Rev. Ricky Burgess
proposed at a special meeting Friday
that the city takes pressure off its uni-

versity students by making Pittsburgh
universities pay their “fair share.”

Local university students and Pitts— .
burghoﬁicialsgatheredataCityCouncil —

meeting, called by city councilman Bill
Peduto, to discuss possible alternatives
to the Fair Share Tax.

Burgess, who represents East
Liberty and Garﬁeld, summed upthe

objective of the meeting. He told the

approximately 50 local college students
inattendancethatPit1:sburghsuniversi—

ties haveaserious ﬁnancial decisionto

make in the coming year.

“Students and universities in Pitts—
burghhaveachoice,” Burgess said. ‘The
FairShareTaxisone choice. Itisachoice
that no one wants — neitherthis coun-
cilnorthe mayor. The otherchoiceisto
do what the City Council is proposing.
We wantthe universitiestovoluntarily
contribute theirfairshare.” L

According to Burgess, it is the
universities that are not cont:r1'buting
enough to the city — not individual
students. For this reason, the council

is asking all universities in the area to

begin making annual donationsto the
city.

“If the local nonproﬁt universities
start contributing more to the city, we
will not pass this tax,” Burgess said.
“It is up to the universities to stand up
and take care of their students. Har-

_ vard gives to the city of Boston. MIT

gives to Cambridge. Yale gives to New
Haven. Ifit’s good enoughforHarvard,
it‘s good enough for the University of
Pittsburgh.” '

Burgess explained that both the
mayor and the City Council arevvilling

tostop pursuingthetaxiflocaluniversi- ~

ties agree to donate their “fair share”
of money to Pittsburgh. He said that,

because local ‘universities are struc-
turedas nonproﬁt organizations, they
do notpayas muchperyearintaxes as
he thinks they should.

Not all of the council members
agreed. Tensions ran high as the meet-
ing progressed, with members of the
council squaring off about the Fair
Share issue. —

Councilman Patrick Dowd ex-
pressed frustration about the tax.

V “Really what we have is a hostage
scenario,” he said. “We have the stu-
dents with ataxfacingthem, and we’re
tellingthem thattheyare goingto have
to fork over $15 million unless their
nonproﬁt universiﬁes pay it for them.

Professor finds that students’ fear of ‘acting white’ doesn’t lower grades

Tara Nair
Staﬁ” Writer

APitt professorrefutedthe claim that
the idea of “actingwhite” discourages
some black students from reaching
theirfull potential

Amanda Lewis, an associate pro-
fessor of sociology at Emory Universi-
ty, gave alecture at the School of Social
Work Conference Center last week in

the Cathedral of Learning. She said
there is still a disparity in graduation
rates, test scores and overall achieve-
ments between white students and
black and Latino students.

Lewis said she is currently re-
searching the topic of the lecture,
which was called “Despite the Best
Intentions: Why Racial Inequality
Persists in Good Schools,” for a book
she is writing. She and her research
partner, Harvard University professor

.111-psi-y4:1:_.:~-nu 1,.

John Diamond, collected data from
morethanzoo interviews and surveys
with students at a high school with
great racial diversity, ahigh amount of
monetary resources and high gradua-
tion rates and test scores.

The statistics showed the school
to be at a higher level of achievement
than other schools in the area. How-
ever, when the results were analyzed
demographically, black and Latino
students seemed to lag behind white

students in overall grade point aver-
ages, standardized test scores and

graduation rates.

A model, titled “Opposition Cul~
ture,” has been proposed by some
sociologists who say minorities who
came to the United States involuntarily
—through slavery or colonization-
have fostered an anti—education mind-
set over the years toward dominant
institutions, such as schools, Lewis
said.

Lewis said prominent ﬁgures,
including‘ President Barack Obama,
who have proposedthatthereexists an
“actingwhite” dilemma among some
children in which highly achieving
black students are discouraged from
pursuing this continued success and
are accused,of“act1'ng white” by their
peers.

Accordingto her research, there is
little evidence backingthis claim. Fur-
thermore, Lewis’ research found that

Pitt offers  
H1N1 shot
to students

Students register for vaccine

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Pitt will offer the injectable form of
the H1N1 vaccine for the ﬁrst time this
week.

Students with registration Nos. 1 to 800
can receive the vaccine at Student Health
Service from 8:30 to 11 a.m. Tuesday, ac-
cording to Pitt’s website.

The vaccine that Pitt has offered in the
past has come in the form of a nasal spray.
Pitt’s website suggests that people who are
pregnant, have a chronic medical condi-
tion, such as asthma or heart disease, or
are immunocompromised take the inject-
able form of the vaccine instead of the
nasal spray.

To register for the vaccine, visit my.pitt.

Dowd challenged the council to come up with

Patrick Dowd

. a better alternative to the Fair Share Tax.

“Pittsburgh has a long and gloried history na-
tionally for doing innovative and creative work
with education,” Dowd said. “How can we legiti-
mately carve out a certain segment of this educa-
tion population andtaxthem? How canwe make
the decision of who to tax?”

The meeting beganwitharound~table discus-
sion between council members and other city
officials. After several rounds of back-and-forth
talkamongthe council members, two local college
students were invited to join the discussion. _

Danieljimenez, president ofPitt’s Graduate and
Professional StudentAssembly, spoke for several
minutes before the council. He outlined his own

esserts for 26

ervice

economic situation, describinghowthe taxwould
put an unfair burden on college students.

“There are%ver 20,000 graduate students in
Pittsburgh seeking PhDs, MDs,]Ds and master’s
degrees,”]irnenez said. “One of the main reasons
people attend graduate school in Pitisburgh is the
affordability ofhousing.Thistaxcouldvery easily
jeopardize that affordability.”

Jimenez, like many others opposing the tax,
claimed that students cannot afford to pay any
more moneyintaxes. ‘

“Graduate t11ition within the School of Arts 8:
Sciences costs $16,402,’? he said. “Is it fair to ask
me to pay another $164 to attend school when
I already live and work in Pittsburgh? That’s my
electricity bill. That’s my heating bill. That’s half
of my food budgetfor amon ” ’

Amanda Cole, asenioratcarnegie Mellon, also
spoke before the council. »

“We alreadypay ourfairshare,” Cole said. “We
participate in community service. We shop and
pay for food.”

Cole went on to describe what she called the
council’s misconception of college students.

“Students are already paying much of their
tuition,” Cole said. “There is this misconception
that itis all parents out of state sending moneyin.
In reality, students are paying much of the way.”

Students will have another chance to address
the council during a public meeting scheduled
for Nov. 30.

He said he convinced Honda to let his fraternity
use the car for the race, so someone could follow
runners and watch out for their safety.

The runroute followed Route 19 for its entirety.
At some points, the chase car following’ directly
behind the runner would cause a back-up in traf-
ﬁc caused by the restrictions of the road being
two lanes.

“The most awkwardthingintheworldistrying

The ﬁaternity raised more than $2,000 for
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation by getting corpo-
rate sponsors for the run, sending letters to local
businesses along the running routes for dona-
tions and holding a date auction. Underground

Corey Clyde, chairman of the third annual 0

Nick Dell’oma, the founder and original
president ofPitt’s chapter ofPhi Delta Theta, was
diagnosed with cystic ﬁbrosis as a child, so the
fratemity decided to adopt the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation as a philanthropy, Clyde said.

black and white students at the high—achieving

homework and wanted to go to college at the
same rates. Teasing among students existed in
the school, but it was not on the basis of race.
However; Lewis found that 65 percent of black
students in the school believed that being black

' meant they had to work harder to succeed.

Some athletes, for example, have an

the course. Part of a college education

of each dorm. Also, most schools offer
intramural sports clubs and activities,
but students could beneﬁt from a for-
malhealth education class. The ﬁtness

However, some don’t know speciﬁci-

real, concrete lmowledge on nutrition.
College life isn’t often synonymouswith
healthy lifestyles, as students often
snuggle to eat properly amid cram-

often overlook adequate exercise. High
schools largely require physical edu-

health classes wouldn’t be something
college students aren’t already used
to.

It would be diﬂicult for every col-

a program, but some schools have a
head start as far as resources. Pitt, for
example, could use those enrolled in

Lewis Lehe Endorses Things

Airsoft guns take aim to
settle our differences

 
   

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

Today, I endorse airsoft guns.

A few weeks ago, my par-
ents came to visit. I wanted my
house to look nice, so I issued an
ultimatum to my housemates. I
wrote it on the dry erase board
we have in the kitchen:

1. Every item you leave out in
the common areas I will hide in
the basement. _

2. I will shoot you one time .
with my airsoft gun for every .
item you leave out.

The second threat was just a
joke. —

Who would shoot someone
with an airsoft gun? An airsoft
gun is a toy gun that shoots plas-
tic BBs. It hurts about as bad as
a bee sting that you got two days
ago. Unless you’re in an airsoft
battle, it’s not polite to shoot
people. ‘

Still, I ﬁgured the ﬁrst threat

 -»\~ : .....-:,..s~-—_ \.:..'-.~_~....._v ...-.2... ;.-,.,;~.,...-.. _.

was strong enough.

I was wrong. I ended up hav-
ing to hide a lot of miscellany in
the basement.

Everyone has cleaned up after
roommates. It’s always the same.
Every piece of clutter seems like
an intentional gesture of disre-
spect. ‘ .

It’s like your ﬂoor is strewn
with middle ﬁngers. Later on,
you retaliate by leaving dishes in
the sink. The contest escalates
silently, like the Cold War arms
race.

This time was different.

While I carried things down
the stairs to hide in the cel-
lar darkness, a funny thought
cropped up: What if I really do
shoot my housemates with an
airsoft gun? ,

I resolved to carry out threat
No. 2. My whole attitude changed
immediately.

,_ _When each sock, box or bike
tool strewn on the floor is a little
ticket to shooting someone with
an airsoft gun, the week-old,

ha1f—empty glass of Coke you
have to pour out starts to look
half full.

Later, as I trained the bead of
my airsoft shotgun on my delin-
quent housemate, I realized I felt
no resentment. ’

“This was just the way things
had to be,” I thought. “The
course of nature compels me to
light up this dude’s a** with an
airsoft gun.”

For the ﬁrst time, I under-
stood what Mr. T means when
he says he pities the fool. Mr. T
feels so sure he will have justice
that he doesn’t even know about
resentment.

He also seems to think that
crossing him is not so much a
matter of villainy as it is foolish-
ness, because crossing Mr. T will
deﬁnitely not pay off. It is a mat-
ter of fact. Hence, Mr. T knows-
only pity. Pity is a better emotion
than bitterness.

I propose we shoot our friends
with airsoft guns whenever we’re
disrespected, betrayed, ignored

Palin’s book to showcase personal life, lack political insight

 
   

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

Howdoes someone become abestsell—
ing author even before releasing her
book? Sarah Palin seems to know, as
her memoir, “Going Rogue: AnAmeri-
can Life,” has already become a best-
seller through pre—orders alone.

Palin’s book has spent 55 days in
Amazon.com’s top 100 bestsellers and
is currently the site’s No. 1 bestseller.

In some ways, this hardly comes
as a surprise.

The former vice presidential can-
didate captures the interest ofRepub-
licans and Democrats alike. Her un-
conventional rise to fame, along with
her soap opera ofafamilydrama, isin-
triguing, albeit sometimes puzzling.

“Going Rogue” is a compilation of

the reasonswhy SarahPalinis suchan
ordinary, down—to—earth American.

It details her upbringing and faith
in God, as well as her experiences —
and qualms —witli the McCain presi-
dential campaign.

However; Palin’s biography is far
from the onlybook that details her life.
A slew of other Palin books, mostly
critical, have also hit bookstore shelves
in the past weeks.

One ofthese is “GoingRouge: Sarah
Palin, AnAmerican Nightmare,” acol-
lection of critical essays that shares the
same release date as Palin’s memoir.

“Going Rouge” shares its title with
anew coloring and activity book. In it,
people can color pictures of pigs and
lipstick, while lookingforphrases like
“joe the Plumber” in word searches.

In spite of the countless hours of
entertainment and insightthese books
could offer, it’s‘still puzzling why any-

one would wanttobuythem, or Palin’s
actual memoir, in the first place. I

Her story and life before politics
were explored constantly during her
runfor the vice presidency, and much
of what she has to say is old news.

Furthermore, as someone whohas
not actually achieved anything signiﬁ-
cant in the realm of politics, her story
is once againwithout merit. ,

Then again, stories about her pom-
star grandbabyfs daddy will make for
a good read.

ButAmerica’s obsession over such
aninconsequentialﬁgureis somewhat
unsettling. Inreenteringthe spotlight,
Palin doesn’t have much to offer the
American public.

Even though some speculate that
she might make a bid for the presi-
dency in2o12, evidence suggests that
such a push will be ineffective or non-
existent.

Palin and others have said on mul-
tiple occasions that she is not retreat-
ing but simply reloading.

But she might be in a position to

ﬁreblanks if she doesn’tfociis on more
than rehashing her down—home irn—
age.
. During a recent interview on the
Oprah Wmfrey Show, Palinwas remi-
niscent of the woman who stumbled
mightily in an interview with Katie
Couric.

She sidestepped Wmfrey’s ques-
tions and reverted to insulting Couric
as “the perky one.”

If Palin were planning a serious
run in 2012, she would fair better by
revamping her image to appeal to a

wider audience.

Her base of conservatives doesn’t
sway in its support, but neither are her
critics. '

Supporters like Rush Limbaugh

have tried to rationalize her rhetoric,
while her opponents continue to see
her as apolitical celebrity, not a politi-
cal candidate.

Personally, I would not venture to

buy or read Palin’s book. Through all .

her hype, I’ve learned enough about
the woman already.

Then again, at a time when many
Americans have fallen on hard times
and are unsure of the ﬁiture, they
might well relate to someone who
presents herself as just your average
mom, stlugglingto balance her career
and home life. ,

But it ends there. -

Until Palin decides to brush up on
her foreign policy and possibly con-
nect to a more costriopolitan America,
I don’t think we_ need to pay her any
mind. ‘ I

or disappointed — whenever
they do pretty much anything \
that would otherwise spark smol-
dering resentment.

Shooting friends with airsoft
guns would prevent petty acts of
vengeance, venting behindpour
friends’ backs and volcanic out-
bursts of anger that don’t make
any sense in context.

It would let us look our
friends in the eyes, because they
would all be equals, instead of
people who unwittingly owe se-
cret debts. It’s a way to resurrect
the age-old practice of dueling,
but without the accompanying
age-old practice of dying.

I can imagine two objections
to my proposal:

1. Wouldn’t people get their
eyes shot out? We would have to
wear sunglasses all day.

2. What if someone gets shot
but doesn’t feel the shot was
justiﬁed? He would feel resent-

The pleasure of airsoft guns
has only started recently, but it

kissing.

It is innate, like the pleasures
of dipping your hands in bowls

Folk artist Hest takes inspiration from family

Press coveragehaspraisedAriHest
for setting himselfapart in the musi-
cal ﬁeld.

He has moved away from standard
labels and created music that, accord-
ing to the Washington Post, is a “me—
lodic folk sound [that] bears hints of
Bruce Springsteen.”

But even if Hest is aware of such
praise, he might not accept such com-
ments as praise at all.

“You can learn some things occa-
sionally, butI don’tpay too much atten-
tion to critiques,” Hest said. “There’s
no way I’m going to please everybody.
IfI get caught up in that, it’ll be dark
situation. I rely on my own ear.”

The singerhas recorded 11albums
and EP releases, all inﬂuenced by his
upbringing. V

He studied piano growing up,
taught himself to play his mother’s
 and listened to many of his fa-
vorite artists’ records, including The

Beatles, SmashingPumpkins andThe A

Police. -
“Music is in the family,” Hest said.
“They never pushed music on me, but

Iknewlcould singfromthetimelwas
alittle kid. Ilikedplaying guitar. Whenl
was in high school, itwas a nice outlet.
Itbecameabiggerpart ofmy lifewhen
Igotto college. Istarted to write songs,
and little by little, it became a bigger
deal to me.”

Hest also played baseball through-
outhigh school. Butincollege, he said,
he knew he didn’t have the talent to
continue professionally.

“I didn’t really like academics, but
I wanted to get through school,” he
said. “After a while, [guitar] seemed
like a better idea. At that point, I was
playing at fraternity parties in college
and getting my feet wet. I didn’t fully
grasp things when I started to play,
butI had very supportive friends [and
family .”

Music not only became his pri-
ority, but it showed itselfas his 
Hest doesn’t have much trouble with
songwriting.

“I have a head for it, and I’m lucky,”
he said.

From his meager college begin-
nings, Hest began releasing his re-
corded albums.

His songs were a composition of
lyrics inspired by his life and music he
often hurnmed and thought out to him-

- selfrather than wrote out on paper.

“I didn’t put too much thought into
production on the ﬁrst album,” Hest
said. “It was more my getting used to

‘ things. I didn’t know whatmade an

album  I tendto go from folk to rock

to something else without hesitation.
'I‘hat’s the way I write. Idon’t like to
into one category.” *

But the act of recording seems to*’

be Hest’s major challenge.
“Recordingfeels pretty unnatural,”

Hest said. “It’s hard to get to a natural

place when you’re doing takes.”
Hesthas also dealtwith rockytimes
and felt insecure about his music ca-
reer, he said. He might ﬁnd an alterna-
tive to music, if he ever felt the need.
“I dabbled with teaching — not
teaching music,” he said. “I kind oflike
numbers. Ihave taught math a couple
of times for substitutes over the last

twoyearsjusttoseeifitwassomethingi

Iwould be interested in. I like it, but not
at much as what I do now.”

For now, Hest said nothing is deﬁ-
nite with him other than being happy
where he is.

_ “I don’t have aplan for the ﬁiuire,”
he Said. “Last year, I did this one song
aweek thing. Iwrote a new song and
released it on my website  This year,
I’mwantingthe pressure off and going
more with the ﬂow. I’rn trying to do
more shows out of the country. But

I love what I do. I don’t feel pressure\

to be famous. I’d love more people to
know my music, but I’m happy with
the way thingsare.

“The thing I like the best is com-
ing up with the songl like and feeling
good about creating something,” he
said. “That’s what I’rn uying to ac-
complish.”

Tybout: Classically bad films offer unique viewing

Andy looks at campy films that earn a_ reputationfor being classically bad

Andy Tybout
Columnist

By far, the worst movie I’ve seen this
yearis“Knowing.”Ithasrecycled char-
acters, recycled dialogue and recycled
plot points. In other words, it was as

cliché as all the other mediocre ﬁlms 

that came out this year. But I wasn’t
disappointed that itwas abad movie. I
was disappointed that it wasn’t enjoy-
ably bad.

1 I, like many of my peers, am nos-
talgic foratimewhenbad movies were
good — when total camp often sur-
passed quality in entertainment value.
I’m talking about “Plan 9 from Outer
Space” (1959). I’m talking about “The
Brain That Wouldn’t Die” (1962). This

was atimewhen movies were uniquely
bad — acut1ing—edge form of medioc-
rity. Rather than cliché dialogue, they
had lines so strikingly sour they kept
viewers at the edge of their seats.

All is not lost, however — there’s
 an outlet for the nostalgic masses
who longforthe cheerfullyterrible. It’s
called The Andy Warhol Museum.

Running now throughjanuary 31,
theWarl1olwill screenanumber ofclas-
sics and clunkers inconjunctionwithits
exhibitofbothwell-known and obscure
ﬁlms, “Super’Irash.”This means movies
that you’ve never known youvwanted
to see (“Silent Night, Deadly Night,”
“Cannibal Apocalypse”) will be just a
short PAT bus ride away.

There’s something about bombs
like these that are truly timeless.'I‘o

bask in the glory of such camp, some
friends andlwentto see a“SuperTrash”
double feature: “Massacre at Central
High” (1976) and “Red Dawn” (1984).
The ﬁrst movie alone was well worth
the 10 dollars.

For those of you not familiar with
“Massacre,” here’s abrief plot summa-
ry:Astraight-edgedyoungman(David)
transfersto afancyhigh school, where
a vicious and well-groomed cadre of
bullies terrorizes the students. Because
David knows one ofthe bullies (Mark),
he’s allowed into their circle of evil. But
David eventually rebelsagainstthe im-

moralityofbullying...bykillingthebul— ~

lies, oneby one.

It’s David’s methods of dispatching
thebulliesthataretrulywonderﬁil. Cut-
tingthecordstotheirhanggliders (ap-

parently bullies ﬂy hang gliders) and
emptying the pool right before a bully
dives in are two of David’s innovative
methods of destruction. '

The lines, as well, are uniquely aw-
ﬁil. When a nerd discovers the latter
bully lying facedown in the emptied
pool, he exclaims, “To think that just
yesterday he was so ﬁill of life!” It’s
enough to make any audience mem-
ber contemplate the ﬂeeting nature of
existence.

But the movie doesn’t stop at sour
dialogue. Whatreallydrivesthis into the
realmofmemorablecamp isits attempt
tornake“Massacre”intoaMarxistpar—
able. When David managesto dispatch
all the old bullies, the nerds become
the new bullies. This means David has

To shootfor mediocrity and achieve
it is a deplorable standard in Holly-
wood. To shootforanimpossible ideal‘
and fail miserably is beautiful. That’s
the difference between “Knowing”
and “Massacre” -— ambition. While
“Kno.wing’ doesn’t pretend to be any-
thing other than a cheeseball disaster
movie, “Massacre” is like a disgraced ,
politician still trying to maintain his
dignity.Theﬁlmiseamestinitsattempt
to make an original, exciting, thought-
provokingﬁlm, and its absolute failure
to do any of those things is what keeps
the audience entertained.

The Andy Warhol Museum should

New Rihanna album
should be rated boring

Kieran I.ayton
A&E Editor

Rihanna

“Rated R
Def Jam
Sounds like: Keri Hilson, Rihanna
minus her talent
Grade: C-

Apparently, Rihanna’s mind is
still in “Disturbia.”

Unlike the time when that
mindset led to deliciously catchy
crop of pop—R&B, however, now
it sounds disturbingly bad on her
fourth album, Rated R.

The cover for the album indi-
cates directly what will follow:
gothic—laced tunes drowned out by
too much makeup or, in this case,
sloppy instrumentation.

It’s not a stretch to say the al-
bum has no memorable tracks.

The debut single, “Russian

Roulette,” sounds simple and un-

interesting, but the second single,
“Hard,” fares slightly better with
its upbeat rap swagger and Young
Jeezy contribution.
But looking for other standouts
proves to be a fruitless effort.
“Rude Boy” sounds like a re-

   

 

jected Sean Paul B-side, “Photo-
graphs” with Will.i.am seems to
have been recorded underwater,
and the jarring “G4L” is merely

’ an unsuccessﬁil attempt to harden

Rihanna’s good-girl image.

“We drivin’ by with them head-
lights off / We know where you stay
/ Know what you did / We don’t
play that sh*t / N*gga, we don’t
play, no  ”

Referencing drive-bys
and dropping racial
slurs doesn’t make

awkward. Wasn’t this the same girl
singing about standing under her
umbrella two years ago‘?

Rihanna has experienced the
tabloid gauntlet with the Chris
Brown incident, but the listener
wishes there were more stimulat-
ing material that came out of it.

“Rockstar 101” is as close as the

_ album gets to “fun,” and “Te Amo”

sounds like a midtempo ballad
that could have been takenfrom
an earlier album — and that’s a
compliment.

At least Rihanna had the de-
cency to let listeners know when
the pain will end. The last song is
called “The Last Song.”

Very astute, Rihanna. Too bad
it is just as bad as everything else
on the album.

Film examines siblings, war

Danish remake gives poignant look at brothers’ 'r

Azia Squire
Staff Writer

“Brothers”

Starring: Tobey Maguire,Jake Gyl-
lenhaal, Natalie Portman
Director: Jim Sheridan

Studio: Lionsgate

Grade: A

In an erawhen overwrought tales
of shimmering vampires dominate
the big screen, “Brothers” — a
remake of the 2004 Danish ﬁlm,
“Brodre” — is a refreshing devia-
tion from the typical, which is a
major part of its appeal. ~

Visceral and stunning, “Broth-
ers” is about two brothers (unsur-
prisingly) — Sam, a successﬁil Ma-
rine (the talented Tobey Maguire)
and Tommy, a charming, but reck-
less ex—convict (Jake Gyllenhaal).

Naturally, the dichotomy be-
tween the siblings is what moves
the story along. Sam is married to
Grace (Natalie Portman), his high
school sweetheart, and they have
two little girls. Tommy is just get-
ting out of jail, and that’s about all
he’s been up to.

When Sam is deported back to
Afghanistan, Tommy slips in his
place, ultimately keeping Grace sane
and bonding with the girls. But when
news surfaces that Sam died over-
seas, Grace falls apart and Tommy
works quickly to put the pieces back
together. Their newfound closeness
has a radical effect on the children
and Hank, the boys’ father, played
by a perfect Sam Shepard. The
chemistry between Portman and
Gyllenhaal is gorgeous and appar-
ent, but it’s just as strong between
Maguire and Portman, which will
leave you torn about which one
Grace should be with. Don’t be so
quick to let Sam’s supposed death
fool you either —— the film knows

how to keep you questioning while
it moves seamlessly through scenes
that could easily be in the present

Regardless, ‘Brothers’
is a must-see

or ﬂashbackuntil it opens up like a _

wound in a shocking revelation.
Though riddled with powerful
performances — Portman is gra-
cious as the grieving, confused
widow. Maguire is enchanting as
the traumatized war hero. Gyllen-
haal is simply unforgettable as the
misunderstood black sheep of the
family — “Brothers” falters where
it should be strongest. It’s called
“Brothers” and supposedly deals

Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Grace (Natalie Portman) grow close.

Cortesy onsgate

especiallybecause Sam and Tommy
are consistently being compared by
their father —__ but the story moves
along more like the Sam and Grace
show than the Tommy and Grace
show, or the Sam and Tommy show.
It seems the movie is aware of this
too, as both Tommy and Sam make
it a point to affirm that they are
deﬁnitely related at various times
during the movie, just in case you
forget; _

Now “Brothers” surely straddles
that delicate line between emotion-
ally complex and emotionally drain-
ing, but it’s not an indie movie with a
Death Cab for Cutie soundtrack. It’s ’

jarring, and somehow, at 110 min-
utes, it ends right where the story
gets especially interesting. Though
it shouldn’t be a three-hour epic,
there’s a good chance you’ll feel like
the spontaneous ending didn’t do
the genius beginning justice.

Regardless, “Brothers” is a must-
see exploration of family, grief and
war. Move over “Twilight: New

Moon,” because Hollywood can ,

obviously make quality ﬁlms for
adults and perhaps should make
them more often.

ﬁlling the hole left by Dejuan Blair.

When Pitt fans think about the
team’s defensive line, the names
that usually come to mind are
defensive ends Greg Romeus and
Jabaal Sheard as well as defensive
tackles Mick Williams and Gus
Mustakas. ‘
But with his recent play, Bran-
don Lindsey is one more name
people are starting to talk about.
Lindsey has raised the play of
the whole defense with his ability
to come into a game when either
Romeus or Sheard need to come

A out without missing a beat.

Against Syracuse, he was all
over the ﬁeld. He accounted for six
tackles with two sacks and 2.5 tack-
les for a loss. In the previous game

against South Florida, he recorded
four tackles and 1.5 sacks.

» “For him to step up and make
the coaches realize that when Greg
and Jabaal get tired they can put
him in — that’s such a help for
our defensive line, so in the fourth
quarter we can stay fresh,” Mus-
takas said.

At 6-foot—2, 240 pounds, Lind-
sey is smaller than the starting
defensive ends, but he more than

makes up for that with his quick— V

ness.

“The best part of my game is
deﬁnitely my speed,” he said. “I
can mix it up inside, but right now
my speed helps me more than any-
thing else because it helps to jump
the snap count.” .

He has been clocked at 4.6 sec-

onds in the 40-yard dash. .

Greg Trietley
Staﬁ Writer

Entering the season, Pitt coachJa-
mie Dixon wondered who would
ﬁll the void left by the departed
Dejuan Blair. The answer isn’t one
player — it’s two.

Gary McGhee and Dante Taylor
have combined to ﬁll the void —
ﬁguratively and physically — left
by Blair’s move to the NBA.

Against Eastern Kentucky,
McGhee had four blocks, a career

high. Taylor had four blocks, also A

a career high.

By the second half of the game,
the Colonels stopped driving to
the rim and opted to shoot from
the perimeter.

Together, Dixon said, McGhee
and Taylor have provided Pitt
with plenty of production from
center.

and four blocks per night. For com-
parison, last season Blair brought
in 15.7 points and 12.3 rebounds
per game. '

McGhee, especially, has allevi-
ated the loss of Blair in the defen-
sive end. .

The junior, who once struggled
with rebounding, has rounded into
a complete package, bringing in six
rebounds against Binghamton and
eight more against Wofford.

Indeed, his offensive board
against the Terriers is the high-
light of the season so far.

The three-point play show-
cased McGhee’s newfound skill.
He called the free throw the big-
gest of his career.

When McGhee subs out, Taylor
steps in to the tune of eight points
and seven rebounds per game. His
12 rebounds against Eastern Ken-
tucky was the most for any Panther
this year.

Gary’s pretty good at it.”

Dixon said the Panthers strug-V’
gled with rebounding early in the
year.

“I wouldn’t say [Taylor] has
got it all down, but none of us do,”
Dixon said. “I don’t even have it
down. I don’t think we’re going to
make judgments on Nov. 19.”

Everything clicked against
Eastern Kentucky, though.

Taylor’s 12 rebounds brought

Pitt’s total on the night to an as-_

tounding 47. The Colonels had“
25. .
As much as Taylor and McGhee
deserve credit — they combined
for nine points, 17 rebounds, eight
blocks and two assists -— Dixon
said the play ofPitt’s guards helped
the turnaround. Guards accounted
for 21 of Pitt’srebounds.

“Coach Dixon is a defensive-
minded coach,” guard Ashton

 

‘This is going to be a team that we play a lot of guys down the
stretch. We’d like to keep that position fresh.

Jamie Dixon

— . “W_e’-ve been getting good num-
bers from that position,” Dixon
said. “Gary McGhee and Dante
Taylor have been playing great
defense, and they’re grabbing re-
bounds.”

The two have split playing time
almost right down the middle this
year.

McGhee, who starts at center,
averages 19.3 minutes per game.
Taylor replaces McGhee off the
bench and plays 19 minutes per
game.

Dixon said the freshman Taylor

has earned his playing time, while .,

McGhee has done nothing to see
his playing time decrease.

“.1 feel pretty good about where
that spot is goingto be,” Dixon said.
“I know they’re going to continue
to improve. Gary’s getting better
every day, and so is Dante.”

The duo combines for an aver-
age of 14.7 points, 13.3.rebounds

4-». — ..—-._,.._,.-,,.. ,..u.,:,-ﬂ,,,.,,r,n-ﬁg: . “—A-a >......~.... ~— .... ...--_.. ---

Dixon said Taylor is just one
productive cog on Pitt’s bench.

“This is going to be a team that
we play a lot of guys down the
stretch,” Dixon said. “It’s going
to be a very balanced team as we
get going.”_ '

Taylor, Lamar Patterson and

' Chase Adams will all see signiﬁ-

cant playing time off the bench -
the three combined for 20 points
against Eastern Kentucky.

The rotation of McGhee and
Taylor, Dixon said, allows for both
players to stay fresh.

‘ “It’s a unique situation, and it’s
different from what we’ve been
doing,” Dixon said. “We’d like to
keep that position fresh. They’re
doing well.”

Against Eastern Kentucky, that
freshness helped Pitt tie a school
record with12 blocks.

“Dante has a little bit of a knack
for [blocks],” Dixon said, “and

'Gibbs’,said. “So we use our de-

fenseto feed our oifense so we.
know any combination can work.
We grabbed some long rebounds
and looked for open shots because
of great ball movement and pen-
etration.”

Nonetheless, Taylor and

McGhee still have work to do as?”

the team nears one month until
Big East play.

Speciﬁcally, Taylor resembles
Blair in a less—than-favorable way:
free-throw shooting.

Blair, who shot 61.4 percent,
from the line in his college career,
is 5 for 12 with the NBA’s Spurs.
Taylor has made just 42.9 percent
of his free-throw attempts — 6
for 14.

But if he and McGhee keep_ 1'

playing the way they did against "
Eastern Kentucky, they might be
compared to Blair in more ways
than that.

The Panthers hit the road for the
ﬁrst time this season as they leave
the friendly conﬁnes of the Petersen
Events Center to travel to Kansas
‘City, Mo., to face the Wichita State
Shockers. Tip-off is set for 7:30 to-
night in the semiﬁnals of the O’Reilly
Auto Parts CBE Classic.

The young Pitt team will face a
tough test, with some players having
never played an away game in their
college careers.

It’s a big challenge,” sophomore
forward Nasir Robinson said. “We’re
just going to go out there and just
pretend that we’re at home — block

‘everything out, block the crowd out,

the fans, the atmosphere -— and just
pretend like we’re still at the Pete.”

Facing a tough mid-major op-
ponent in Wichita State is another
challenge.

The Shockers return three start-
ers from last year’s team that ﬁn-
ished 17-17 in the Missouri Valley
Conference, which is notorious for
knocking offbigger programs.

Guards Toure Murray with 15.5
points per game, David Kyles (11) and
forward_]T Durley (15) lead Wichita
State (2-0).

Pitt, now 3-0, seems to have
started ﬁguring things out in its
past couple of games after its opener
against Wofford.

In Pitt’s latest win against East-
ern Kentucky, guard Ashton Gibbs
continued his hot shooting, scoring

low.

With a win over Wichita State,
the Panthers would play the winner
of the No. 3—ranked Texas and Iowa
game in the tournament ﬁnals to-
morrow night. With aloss, Pittwould
face the loser of that game.

“Brandon’s speed and agility is
awesome,” Mustakas said.

In high school, Lindsey was a
standout tailback and linebacker at
nearby Aliquippa High School.

He rushed for 1,251 yards and

#19 touchdowns in his junior sea-
son on offense and also made 120
tackles to go with 11 sacks on de-
fense in the same season. He was

one of the nation’s top high school ‘

prospects.

“Playing running back really
helped me get tougher,” Lindsey
said. “Taking hits every play really
gave me an edge on how college
would be like.”

Lindsey’s college career started
slowly, as he came in playing line-

/ ..backer and was redshirted his ﬁrst _

year. The next season he played
sparingly at linebacker and on spe-
cial teams because it was tough to
crack the starting lineup playing
behind star players like Scott McK-

illop and Greg Williams.

ﬁnd a way to get Lindsey on the
ﬁeld, so last spring they moved him
