The Student Government (SG)
Senate meeting scheduled for
Wednesday night was unable to
conduct any business because of

 

‘the absence of a quorom.

SG President Ken Frederick,
however, made the following
announcements: ~

> A committee has been form-
ed to investigate the SAGA food
in-stillations. Its membership
consists of Vicki Rashbaum, rep-
resenting the Association of
Women’s Students (AWS) ; Ter-
ry Gordon, president of Men's

Pransky, member o-f MDC.

> Chancellor Wesley Posvar
is concerned about police pro-

been conferring with the Uni-
versity and Pittsburgh police to
improve the present situation.

‘> A committee will be formed
to decide on the location for a
new Student Union building.
The committee membership Wllll
consist of administrators, fac-
ulty, and students.

> SG has invited the SG pres-
idents of the regional campuses

to an informal meeting which '

will discuss common student
problems.

> SG is sponsoring a smoker
to acquaint freshmen and sopho-
mores to the working of the
Senate and SG committees.

Senator Kathy Mcllugh gave
a report -on the SG Health Com-
mittee’.-s ﬁndings. “As it is now,
when a student has an accident,
he must ﬁrst go to the health
service to obtain a note. This
could be changed if the cost of
the student health insurance
was raised from $75 to $100,”
said McHugh.

“Under this new system, the
student having an accident could
go directly to Presbyterian Hos-
pital instead of picking up the
note at the Health Center,” she
said.

The increase of the health in-
surance to $100 is also neces-
sary because of rising medical
costs, according to Dr. Douglass
S Thompson, director of the
Health Center.

Professor Morgenthau Cites Danger

Of Loosening of Intellectuals’ Honesty 0

DR. HANS MORGAN THAU
Values Intellectual Honesty

by HOBART HARRIS
Professor Hans Morgen-
thau, famous political theor-
ist, spoke Wednesday at the

Student Union Forum on‘

“The Role of the Intellectual
in Today’s Society.” Taking
the stand that the intellec-
tual cannot speak truthfully
and candidly to the govern-
ment, our society “will lose its
vitality .and ability to adapt.”
Professor Morganthau began
by pointing out that the Amer-
ican intellectual is highly inte-
grated into society. “The intel-
lectual. is typically part of so-
ciety rather than an aristocrat
or a member of the leisure class
as,in other countries,” he point-
ed out. “There is an organic

connection between the intellec-
tual and society.”
WMorgenthau said t'ha.t this re-
lationship was true from the
very founding of our country.
“The great founding fathers
were at one and the same time
philosophers and statesmen. The
Federalist Papers ‘are unsurpass-
ed, yet they were not written
for an intellectual purpose.”

This relationship has become
even “more intimate,” accord-
ing to Morgenthau, as Univer-
sitys have become virtual “serv-
ice stations” to the government.
However, this relationship can

‘ become to close, or the motives

of the intellectual too clouded,
and the relationship can become
counterproductive. This is what
Morgenthau spent most of his
speaking time on—the possible

‘Weekend at Pitt’ Plans Announced

As part of the Secondary
Schools program, chairman
Barry Nudelman announced
this week the formation of
the first “Weekend at Pitt.”
The program is similar in
scope to the old “Pitt Pevlew,”
and will be held Friday, Satur-

da, and Sunday, March 8, 9,
and 10.

The weekend agenda which
--includes greetings by the ad-
ministration and students, a tour
of the campus lead by second-
ary schools personnel, a forum
discussing .pertinant topics, and
a concert by student groups is
“the culmination of the activ-
ities of the ‘secondary schools
committee for the winter tri-
mester,” according to Nudel-
man. “It is geared to increase
the ratio of out of state stu-
dents and higher quality in-state
student.”

Upon acceptance to the Uni-
Versity, a high school senior will
be sent a letter by a member of
the secondary schools commit-
tee. Certain of these lette-rs will
include invitations to partici-
pate in the weekend event.

When a student decides to ma-
triculate at the University, i.e.

ceive a congratulatory letter

from the same person with.

whom he corresponded previ-
ously, along with ,a card which
certiﬁes his admission as a stu-
dent of the freshman class.
Besides the weekend, the Sec-
ondary Schools Committee is
planning to send certain quali-
ﬁed secondary school personnel,
particularly from out of state
areas, back to their high schools,
“there there has been enthusi-
asm shown by the guidance

counselor to the admissions of-
ﬁce.” Over Christmas these peo-
ple will carry on discus-snions
about the different aspects of
the University.

In order for a student to feel
particularly at home at the Uni-
versity, hosts and ‘hostesses will
be from their high school area
and members of the Secondary
Schools Committee.

Applications are now avail-
able at the SU desk for positions
on the Second-ary Schools Com-
mittee.

dangers inherent in the intellec-
tual-governmental partnership.

The rel=a‘tio~nship is suscepti-‘bile
to two basic’ faults, both of
them dealing with the intellec-
tual’s willingness or ability to
tell the govermnent the truth,
rather than what it Wants to
hear. The ﬁrst fault is the ex-
tent to which an expert can give
advice to the government about
that yie does not agree with.
“The fundamental moral prob-
lem is how far the intellectual
can go to give expert advice on
means to ends that he does not
agree with,” Morgenthau point-
ed- out. “Implicit in the intellec-
tual’s positison of giving expert
advice is that he transforms
himself into a supporter of the
policys that his advice is ap-
plied to.”

Involved in the intellectuals’
problems of involuntary commit-
ment is the problem of motives
and power—-often the intellec-
tual is deeply interested
“Academics by nature have lit-
tle power,” Morgenthiau pointed
out, “bu-t when the government
asks them to do something, it
gives the academic power to

change what happens in the US
and perhaps the world. In our
time intelrlectu-als have given up
searching fo-r truth for no more
than the semblance of power."

“Traditionally it is the func-

tion of the intellectual to make .

what is not true appear true
philosophically, to demonstrate
that what is black is white,
what is good is ]bad,” Morgen-
thau continued. “This is not only
a corruption of the function of
the intellectual, but a. complete
perversion of that function.”
This problem is hetigwh-tened by
the government's inalbsiiliisty to ac-
cept advice that is not constant
with its own views of the would.
“There is an existential conﬂict
between truth and power that
the leaders tend to resolve in
terms of power,” Morgenthnalu

"emphasized. “It is no accident

that political philosophers -have
been faced with this phenome-
non. Intellect-uzals from AI1i-sto-
tole to Marx have been impris-
oned, banished o-r suffered se-
vere personal hardsihips as a re-
sult of their views. The inetllec-
tual history of political thouguhlt
is the history of the persecution
of those who would speak truth
to power.”

Morgenntlhlau felt that there is
a very real danger that the in-
tellectual will sell out to the
people in power. “If no voice is
heard against the policys and
the beliefs of government, you
have a totalita-rian country.”

Peace COYPS Recruits Southworth Joins University;

_ Interested Volunteers

A Peace Corps recruiting team will be visiting the Uni-

"versity through the week Nov. 13.

The recruiters are all former volunteers who have re-
turned from their assignments.

Severin Hochberg, one of the recruiters spent two years
in Malawi teaching secondary school. He worked on a na-
tional census, taught in night school for adults, was a li-
brarian and traveled in Africa. "

He explained the recruiting program as follows. Half
hour modern language aptitude tests will be given Wednes-
day through Saturday in 519 SU, at 10 a.m.., 2 pm. and 4
p.m. Films will be shown on India, Brazil and Kenya in that

same room from 11 a.m. to 12:30
pm., Tuesday through Friday.
According to Hochberg, the

I 9 Peace Corps provides numerous

opportunities. Experiences serv-
ing with that group afford an
individual the chance for per-
sonal growth. It also is a “break
in continuous eduction,” Hoch-
berg noted.

He emphlalsized that Peace
Corps volunteers are now 1-0-
in 58 countries of the
world. These countries mainly
need teachers, but those skilled
in community development, ag-
riculture and public works are
also needed.

All th-ose accepted for the
Peace Corps program must go
through a training program.
During the three months of
training they are ‘taught a ski.ll
and a language. No prior skill
or language is required. Each
person then works as a p-art of
a speciﬁc project under a min-
istry of the host country. Hoch-
berg stated tliat one can choose
more or less the country in
which he would like to work.

Thus far 69 University stu-
dents have served in the Corp.

Eour other recruiters will be
working on campus next week,
assisting Hochberg.

Gaynell Scalise spent two
years in Turkey Where she
taught English in a secondary
school. She helped set up a dor-
mitory for boys in her village
and did the scenery and make-
up for the school «play.

A nursery school teacher in
Cameroon, Mary Ann Tirone
helped establish a library in that
capital. The government, on the
basis of her success requested
her to organize a library in
the-ir new training school.

Brewster Perkins lived in In-
dia from 1965-67, where he was
assigned to the Agriculture De-
partment setting up 150 demon-
stration poultxzy units.

Another elementary school
teacher, Mary Michlin spent two
years in the Philippines. Be-
sides teaching, she belonged to
comm-unit’y organizations such
as a choral group and remedriall
reading clinic.

ation at the University.

What is different in the ele-
mentary education department
of the school this year? For one-
thing incoming students have
the burden of 131 required cred-

students receive credit for ﬁrst

and they now must take extra
credits in the social sciences,

Professor Questions Drug Use

by DIANE BLOCII

Marijuana will probably be
legalized in the future, just
as alcohol was legalized, ac-
cording to Dr. Oakley S.
Ray, professor of psychology
at the University. He spoke
Wednesday evening to QU-
AX, women’s science honor-
ary, on “Law, Science and
Drugs.”

“There is no evidence that
LSD vvill improve creativity,”
said Dr. Ray. He explained that
under LSD some individuals be-
come expansive and grandiose
and «begin to think they are
more creative. But since .the in-
dividual’-s powers of judgment
are at a reduced level, this is
n-ot the case.

LSD users are generally emo-
-tionally immature, unstable, and
are apathetic because life has
no meaning fo_r them. They used
LSD in an effort to ﬁnd som-e-
thing that will give life mean-
ing, he continued.

D1‘. Ray disapproves of LSD
because there is a possibility of
harmful effects. He said, “It
can precipitate a psychoatic re-
action that will require hospital-
ization for an entire life time.”

The effects of LSD can last
from 8-12 hours or foreever. The
user ﬁrs:t begins to get color
distortions where one color be-
comes vivid and dominant and
then fades out; then this hap-
pens to the other colors. ..
..Next come ego disturbances
which result in bizarre bodily
sensations. The user then either
becomes very expansive and
thinks he is creative or else he
becomes worried about what
other people think of him and
enters a paranoid state, explain-
ed :the psychology professor.

Illusions occur. and memory is
less effective. The response to

Free-lancer David Hapgood
Views Americans in Africa

David I-Tapgood, Peace Corps consultant and free-lance writer,
will discuss “Americans in Africa” in a public lecture at 11 am.
Tuesday in the Chatham College Ohazpel.

Hapgood is a senior research fellow at the Center for Inter-
national Studies, New York University, for the current academic
year. His present Peace Corps assignment is to evaluate its over-

seas program in Africa.

Hapgood served on the staff
of the New York Times, writing
for the “News of the Week in
Review” sect-ion, from 1957 to
1961. From 1961 to 1963, he was
a Fellow at the Institute of Cur-

rent World Affairs, studying ru- ’

ral development in French speak-
ing West Africa. ‘

PROFESSOR OF Psychology Oakley Bay, in discussing “Law,
Science, and Drugs,” used sketches to illustrate certain points.

LSD is dependent upon the his-
tory and environment of the
user, he added.

With marijuana also, Dr. Ray
explained, behavior results from
the user's speciﬁc history. In
general, the effe-ots are real eup-
horia, extreme well-being, some
impulsive behavior, uncontroll-
able laughter, incess-an-t talking,
sensory distortions, time distor-
tions and sometimes depression.

Dr. Ray said that many mari-
juana users are from low socio-
economic groups and smoke pot

either as a rebellion or as an ‘

easy way to gain pleasurable ex-
perience. “Marijuana does not
necessarily lead to the use of
higher drugs,” Dr. Ray state.
“There is no proof so far that
there are any bad effects from
the use of marijuana.”

Dr. Ray questions the law
prohibiting the sale and useof
marijuana because it is ineffec-
tive. Reefers are easily obtain-
able on most college campuses.
They cost about 75 cents each,
a relatively small amount.

Dr. Ray also spoke about nar-
cotics, a more harmful drug.
The opiates have an extensive
effect. “Fifty per cent of hero-

in-users die in
years.” said Dr.

The narcotics user ﬁrst feels
naucious. Then he will get a
real quasi-sexual thrill from the
narcotic. He then settles down
to a dream state lasting from
3-5 hours, where he is not in-
terested in -anything, the psy-
chologist described.

The narcotic helps the user to
diminish pain, anxiety and dis-
comfort. Normal people who do
not have these problems receive
no beneﬁcial effect from nar-
cotics.

Dr. Ray said that even before
considering the effect of any
form of drugs on the individ-
u1al’s personal life, it is ﬁrst
necessary to think about the leg-
al risk. The major deterrent
from the use of all drugs is that
they are illegal. Thus the deci-
sion whether to use the drugs
is ﬁrst of all a moral one.

must obtain a QPA of 2.5 in or-
der to student teach during their
senior year. However, these re-
quirements are not retroactive
to those already in the School of
Education. »

But Dr. Southworth himself
has done things differently:
Many of the present student
teachers have remarked that Dr.
Southworth has visited them
and has asked them what they
thought. He has taught some of
the senior education courses.
“And he was good!” one anony-
rnous girl commented. He is al-
ways in and out of his office,
havin.g interviews, and seeing
students as well as fellow teach-
ers. As Mrs. Celia Lerrnan, sec-
retary to Dr. Southworth, con-
fesses, “He’s booked to Friday.
How about next week?”

Dr. Southworth came to the
University from Michigan State
University (MSU) where from
1959 to 1967 he was one of the
developers and directors of the
College of Education in Ma-
comb County, which is the teach-
er education division of MSU.
Dr. Southworth received his
B.A., M.A., and Ed.D. degrees
from MSU. He had taught and
served as principal of elemen-
tary schools in Michigan.

There, one of the director's
major concerns was the prep-
aration of the teacher during
the student teaching term.

Joining the University in Jan-
urary as the Assistant Chairman
of the Elementary Education
Programs will be Dr. James
D. Hoffman. Dr. Hoffman is also
a form-er faculty member of
MSU. He has been connected
with the Teacher Education Cen-
ter in Grand Rapids, Mich., and

he was appointed a consultant 

to the Learning Systems Insti-
tute in 1964. Dr. TI-Ioffman re-
ceived his B.S. and M.A. de-
grees from Ball State Teachers
College and his Ed.D. from MSU.

“My purpose today,” Dr.
Southworth continued at the In-
diana conference, “is to re-em-
phasize and recast some ideas
which may not be new, but seem
integral to our work in teacher
education.”

University Professors Favor
Rights, Freedoms of Students

.-_\"y

   

R

WASHINGTON (CPS) -~ The
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors has become the
second of ﬁve national organiza-
tions to go on record in favor
of a joint statement on the
rights and freedom-s of students.

The statement endorses such
right-s as a student role in po-
licy-making and due process for
students in disciplinary cases.

The AAUP’s national council
unanimously endorsed the state-
ment during a closed meeting
here last weekend. Although the
statement still must be present-
ed to the full AAUP member-
ship at a meeting next April,
the passage there appears like-
ly. The Council is the organiza-
tion's policy-making body and
its recommendations have con-
siderable inﬂuence on the mem-
bership. The Council consists of
30 elected representatives.

The National Student Associa-
tion (NSA) was the first of the
ﬁve organizations to endorse the
statement. This action, came at
the NSA Congress in August.

In addition to the AAUP and
NSA, the statement was draft-
ed by represenstatives of the
American Associtaion of Col-
lege-s (AAC), the National As-
socitaion of Student Personnel
Administrations (N ACPA), and

the National Association of
Womenls Deans and Counselors
(NAWDC). The governing body
of AAC will consider the state-
ment in January, and the poli-
cy-making bodies of NASPA and
NAWDC will review it next
April.

These three hurdles for the
statement are considered tough-
er than NSA and AAUP approv-
al, since these groups, particu-
larly the AAC, were more con-
servative in their views during
the drawing up of the statement
this summer. A survey of col-
lege presidents conducted by
the magazine College Manage-
ment showed that most of them
agreed with basic academic free-
doms of students in principle
but were less willing to ap-
prove such practical «applica-
tions as a free student press
and free choice of campus
speakers.

The statement is considered
signiﬁcant because the bodies
which drafted it represent ad-
ministrators, faculty members,
and students.

Robert Van Waes, associate
secretary of AAUP, said the
AAUP council was “very en-
thusiastic” about -the principles
of academic freedom for stu-
dents. He termed the joint state-

ment “a big step toward creat-
ing a national consensus on cer-
tain student rights and free-
doms and a preluce to achieving
a national concensus on the stu-
rlent role in institutional govern.
ment.”

Some of the major provisions
of the statement include:

>A long list of due process
requirements in major cases, in-
cluding putting the burden of
proof on the college and guar-
anteeing the student's right to
defend himself.

>The right to attend college
without regard to race, to in-
vite speakers of students’ own
choosing, and to have complete
freedom of off-campus action
without fear of university pun-
ishment for the violation of oiv-
il laws.

> Protection of students from
“arbitrary and prejudiced” grad-
ing by professors.

» A free student press. When-
ever possible, the statemenit
says, studenrt newspapers should
be legally and ﬁnancially auto-
nomous from the university as
a separate corporation. When
this is no-t possible, the state-
ment urges a student press suf-
ﬁciently autonomous to remain
a vehicle for freedom of in-
quiry and expression.

  Editorial: A Never -Ending Battle

Now that all of the elections are over, we fervently hope that our
elected state officials will not turn to the business of running our state

i government. We cannot emphasize enough our dissatisfaction with their

failure to reach a compromise on the matter of state appropriations.
There are those who may question our repeated critcisms of the men
involved in the legislative dispute, feeling that it is really out of our realm.

 We cannot disagree more strongly, because we can never ignore the fact
i that the University is now state-reated and dependent on state funds to

operate.
Our extreme dependence was underscored by the resolution recently

. passed by our Board of Trustees, authorizing the University to request up
A to $15 million in order to meet our operating expenses for the months of

October, November, and December. It is already November, and there is

‘no talk of compromise. The only talk ‘ye hear is that there is a definite

possibility that the University will have to endure similar legislative stale-
mates every year. We feel there is a definite validity in that statement,
as the only thing we have to judge our future dealings by is our past rela-
tionship with t'he state. This is the second successive year we have been
victimized by our elected officials’ penchant for playing politics at the ex-
pense of meeting their obligations.

When we question the various parties involved and ask what can be
done to resolve such occurrences, there is never any optimism. As Chan-
cellor Posvar stated, “I’m afraid it’s always possible.” He termed the pres-
ent state of affairs “a true political impasse,” citing the fact that the two

Our own analysis of the situation makes us believe that neither the
Democratic or Republican leadership can be exonerated. However, we be-
lieve that the real key to the failure to resolve the situation does lie with
Gov. Shafer. Disregarding party labels, we feel that the Governor should
have sacrificed getting his entire program passed intact to the necessity
of getting a program passed. He is a man versed -in the art of politics, his
state experience include not only serving as lieutenant governor under
former Gov. William Scranton but also serving in the legislature.

Observors on the scene express amazement to us that he has acted as
he did in this major challenge to his administration. This is not the only
instance of Gov. Shafer’s failure to compromise. Another instance we cite
to prove our point is his handling of his Tax Study Commission. He had
appointed our Chancellor Emeritus David Kurtzman to chair the commis-
sion and supposedly was going to give the Commission’s findings careful
consideration. He later decided to dismiss the Commission’s recommenda-
tions, and the way Dr. Kurtzman found out about«Gov. Shafer’s stands was
by reading it in the newspaper. It is amazing that an experienced poli-
tician would act in that manner.

We do not mean to question Gov. Shafer’s concern over the legisla-
tive stalemate. However, we reiterate that as the chief executive of the
state he must accept that he has far from an ideal situation. In order to
carry out his duties, he cannot hold out for his entire program. He must
take that first step and yield on some of his requests if that is the only
way to pass a tax program. A partial victory is far better than a total

 

parties are almost evenly matched as a reason for their actions.

Man by a Landslide

by Michael Brourman

' ONE OF the most satis-
fying aspects of this week’s

‘elections was the setback

Man handed to the Machine.
The computers and the

‘professional pollsters were

handed a thorough drubbing

L‘ by the voters. In election af-

ter election, the “predicted
winner,” normally chosen
by the machines only min-
utes after the polls closed,

V was the man making a con-

cession speech in the wee
hours of‘ the morning.

This is a gratifying sen-
sationregardless of one’s
party or personal choice. It
is nice to know that there
is still not a machine that
can make our choices for
us, or tell us what they will
be before we make them.

THE COMPUTER RACE
began in earnest in the 1960
elections. When it started,
it was relatively innocuous,
as they usually made their
predictions after the candi-
date had piled up a com-
manding lead.

But, as the network brass
began developing confidence
in their metal beasts. they

began to make their choices ~

earlier and earlier. Quickly
it turned into a’ race, with
the networks competing to
see who could predict the
most winners the earliest.
The race soon developed
into a sort of planned ab-
surdity. Last year, the TV
election night viewer could
find out who had “won” ev-
en before the polls closed.

THEN, as will happen ev-
ery time anyone tries to.
make a science out of peo-
ple’s minds, the mistakes
started to show up. At first
they were just a glimmer,
but they soon swelled into
an enormous black-eye for
the pollsters.

It was heartening to lis-
ten to KDKA’s Paul Long
and Ed King try to deci-
pher the jumble of confus-
ing reports that piled up on
them after the computer
and the pollsters had re-
ported Seth Taft the win-
ner in the Cleveland mayor-
ality race. the machines sud--
denly changed their minds.
They declared Carl Stokes
the winner. Then they hedg-

Finally, they sent out a
release saying that no ap-
parent trends had develop-
ed, and an explanation of
what had happened. As Ed
King said, “This is so com-

plicated that I don’t even
understand the explana-
tion.”

IT WAS just as hearten-
ing to listen while profes-
sional pollster John Bucci
declared George Ross and
James Knox winners in
their county_races. After
hearing Mr. Bucci’s report,
KDKA’s Long and King,
both experienced in election
coverage, could not, and
did ‘not try to hide their
pessimism.

It was apparent that Ross
and Knox had not built a
commanding lead in Pitts-
burgh, thus Long practical-
ly ignored Bucci’s “sure-
thing.” and spoke of the late
“suburban returns.” Sure
enough, when the smoke had
cleared, there was Mr. Ross
and then Mr. Knox conced-

Dear Chris Warden:

We, in turn, are ashamed of
you. You, n-ot the ROTC, have
soiled the name of academicism.
By disrupting a university func-
tion and then refusing to abide
by a system set up by the uni-
versity, you have shown a shock-
ing lack of respect for this
school and the academic ide-alas
it prnplsims. Disrsspgst far 1hi§
university is disrespect for aca-
demicism itself.

You, Chris Warden, are hypo-
crite. While you profess a philo-
sophy of. academic freedom, you
would at the same time con-
demn a fellow student for choos-
ing a course which is not to
your liking. You have an idio-
syncrasy about ROTC just as
we. might have an idiosyncrasy
about Intermediate Serbo-Croa-
tian( but we would not barge
into a classroom disrupting the
proceedings, because we recog-
nize the students’ academic right
as part of this instintuti-on to
choose their own course of study.
By university regulation the
Cathedral lawn is a classroom
when ROTC is drilling.

Your refusal to go before the
Board of Appeals reveals noth-
ing but your obstinate and re-
calcitrant nature. We here at
Pitt prize our academic free-
dom and refuse to surrender it
to the whimsical prejudices of
campus bigots. Isn't it time you
moved on to Carnegie-Mellon
where they appreciate your kind
of part-time student, full-time
antagonist.

Student Attacks

Abrams’Co1umn

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to comment on
Ivan Abram-s’ column in Mon-
day's Pitt News. After one man-
ages to wade his way through
the maze of wild generalizations
and gross over -simpliﬁcations

two things become apparent:

(1) Mr. Abrams has been read-
“Merchants of

and (2) he knows absolutely
nothing the ROTC.

Mr. Abrams claims we are in
Vietnam because the so called
“military - ind-ustrial interests”
wanted a war and somehow
-picked that unfortunate nation
to wage one in. I-Iogwash! We
are ﬁghvtin-g there .because o-ur
government decided it i-s in the
best interests of this country
to contain an aggressive, imper-
iualrisrtic--ty-pe communist system
from expanding any further in
SE Asia. If there are any logical
alternatives to reaching this
goal, I certainly haven't heard
them from Mr. Abrams and his
friends.

As for the ROTC, if I were .

Mr. Abrams I would thank my

~ lucky stars that there are over

600 fellow students who are 
ing to give a cowple of years in
service to their country. If not
for them we might even have
to depend on Mr. Abrams and
-his little ban-d of blusterers for
protection. And I’m1sure he ab-
hors the thought of helping to
defend his country and all that
it stands for as much as he
does the existence -of the ROTC.

He calls for a divorcement of
the military from the rest of
society. If ‘he got his wish there
would evolve at ‘vvlialél-‘y profes-

\ sional military that owed allegi-

ance to no one except itself. It
is conceivable that such a~force,
since it would not identify with
the completely segregated civili-
an society, might decide it wants
to run the whole country. Who
could or would stop it? Mr.
Abrams and friends? I doubt it.

The 14,000 officers that are
commission-ed from the ROTC
every year, besides being neces-
sary to maintain a sound mili-
tary postu‘-re, also insure . that

American soldier and civilian

will never differ. Because of its
awesome power, the military,
above all institutions, must re-
main in the mainstream of
American society. The ROTC
programs at hundreds of col-
leges and universities help in-
sure that it does.

Mr. Abrams writes a lot about
freedom and rights, but doesn’t
seem too keen on helping to de-
fend the system that gives him
those precious gifts. In fact, he
is aclbicatin-g his responsibility
to that system and relying in-
stead upon the organization he
ﬁnds so repungent, the ROTC,
to make up for his dereliction
of duty. Forshlame, Mr. Abrams,
f-orshame!

He mentions some -of the many
intern-al probllems facing this na-
tion. Using his sterling logic to
its fullest extent, he decides the
s-olurtion to Poverty, Crime, War,
ect. is to picket the ROTC. Isn’-t
logic wonderful? He also dis-
likes uniforms and weapons on
campus. University Police, be-
ware! You may be next!

Paul M. Weiss
Class of 1968

Grad Student
Justifies ROTC

Editor, The Pitt News:

Although I am in agreement
with anti-ROTC demonstrations,
I should like to express some
reasons for keeping both ROTC
and attendant demo-nsrtrati-ons in
the campus environment.

First, I must point out some
inaccuracies in Mr. Abrams’ ar-
ticle (“Militarism on Campus”
Nov. 6, 1967) that detract from
the credibility of his argument.
In marked contrast to the gen-
geralizations offered by Mr.
Abrams in support of his in-
dustrialist--militarist power the-
sis, there has, in fact, been 60
per cent decline in quarterly
corporate proﬁts; laborers have
indeed “been rpermited to strike
for better wages and working

condirtions,” to the extent that

corporate income will be sub-
stantially reduced during the

cAR£f.?:f”

   

 

next ten months; and the cost
of the Vietnam-'I‘hailland cam-
paign has pushed interest rates
to their highest levels since the
Civil War.

If the cause of our nation’s
paranoia were simply a collu-
sion of money-hungry industrial-
ists and power-crazy militarist,
would they not have acted to
maximum profits, to make mon-
ey readily -available for their
purposes, and to pacify those
unhappy with their lot in the
ghettos? I suspect that the re-
sponsibility for our political
sickness is not limited to the
economic-military “power struc-
ture" but extends to every citi-
zen capable of serious thought.
Because the academic commun-
ity is presumed to be composed
exclusively of people who can
think seriously, such a commun-
ity carries special responsibility
in this matter.

Therefore, I suggest that it is
essential to keep ROTC on cam-
pus as a symbol of the gove-rn-
ment’-s paranoia, until such time
as you and I no longer require
reminders, sandwiched between
classes, tests, and ball games, of
the madness of the nation’s mil-
itarism. Without the reality of
ROTC, 10,000 busy students
would be critically less aware
of the urgent problems facing
us.

In conclusion, I have found
some of the foundation-s of Mr.
Abram-s’ argument to be faulty,
and I have proposed a necessary
reason for maintaining the sym-
bol of militarism in our environ-
ment. Can Mr. Abrams show us
that by tossing the albatross
overboard he will have elimin-
ated the curse?

(marijuana, etc) on the Cam-

ceeded, I became increasingly
aware that the panelists would
conﬁne themselves to the de-
tailed examination of symptoms
with minimum attention to
thought in the area of cures.

The discussion panelists told
us about the physical, legal and
moral aspects of drug usage.
Some measure of agreement
was reached on the idea that
the student user of psychedelic
drugs was in search of a way
toward consciousness expansion
and release from fru-strations.
But no mention was made of the
hazardous drug route toward
achievement of consciousness
expansion a-nd understanding
did exist (although I was cer-
tain that at lea-st some of the
panelists might have been aware
of it).

Blaryland Law Nullified

Oaths Unnecessary
For State Employees

WASHINGTON (CPS) — In two major decisions, the Su-
preme Court overturned a Maryland loyalty oath for state em-
ployees and refused to consider the case Of three Army privates
who have said they will not serve in Vietnam because the war

there is illegal.

The decision in the Maryland case, as in past loyalty oath
cases, dealth only wit-h the wording of the oath and not with the
concept of loyalty oaths in general. It therefore d-oes not set a.
precedent for the invalidation of all government loyalty oaths.

In the case of the three soldiers, the court ruled by a 7-2 vote
that it had no jurisdiction over the question of the war’s legality.
Justice Douglas and Stewart dissented, suggesting that the court
should hear the petition from the soldiers.

Neither justice indicated any position on the question of the
war’s legality, but they said the court was avoiding the issue by

refusing to hear the case.

The soldiers, who are now serving three—year court-martial

.sentences for refusing to go to Vietnam, h-ad based their appeal

to the court on the claims that the US had violated in-ternational
law by intervening i-n Vietnam and that the admin-istration had
violated the Constitution by failing to secure a declaration of war

from Congress before becoming
involved in Vietnain.

In the loyalty oath case, the
court, by a 6-3 majority, ruled
that the wording of the oath
was too broad. Justice Douglas,
who wrote the majority deci-
sion, said of the oath that the
“lines between permissible and
im-permissible conduct are quite
indistinct. Precision and clra-rilty
are not present. Rather, we ﬁnd
an overbrea-dvth that makes pos-
sible oppressive or capricious
application as regiirmes change.”

The justice raised the possi-
bility that a person who be-
lieved in “peaceful revolution”
might unwittingly become a.
member of “subversive” organ-

ization. If he had taken the oath, I

according to Justice Douglas, he
might be subject to the charge
of perjury. The oath states that
all signers are subject to the
Maryland perjury statute.

The ﬁrst part of the oath
reads in part, “I do hereby state
that I am not engaged in one
way or another in an attempt
to overthrow the Government
o-f the United States or the State
of Maryland or any political
subdivision thereof either b-y
force or violence.”

The petitioner in the loyalty
oath ca-se was Howard White-
hall, an instructor in creative
writing at John Hopkins who
was refused employment at the
University of Maryland because
he would not sign the oath.

Sanford Rosen, a. University
of Maryland law professor, was
the attorney in the case.

The loyalty oath had former-
ly been required of all state
employees in Maryland, includ-
ing faculty members at the
state's colleges and universities.
The state can no longer require
employees to sign this oath, but
it may draw up another one
that will not be as broadly word-
ed as this one.

Pianist Edward Auer Opens

EDWARD AUER
Debuts in Pittsburgh

Edward Auer, the most hon-
ored young American pianist,
will make his Pittsburgh de-
but this Wednesday evening at
8:40 in the YM and WI-IA Mu-
sical Society of Belleﬁeld Ave.

Referred to as the brightest
star of the new generation of
American pianists, Edward Auer
is the ﬁrst American to win a
prize in the Warsaw Chopin
Competition. He is also a win-
ner in the Moscow Tschaikow-
sky Comspetition, the Marguer-
ite Long-Jacques Thibaud Con-
test in Paris, the Beethoven Con-
test, Vienna, etc.

In this respect, the opening of
the Chopin B minor sonata was

ger and Wi11iam’St_vron have
been named as the National
Board of Judges of the Book-

Annual Writing Fellows-hip.

The Writing Fellowship Pro-
gram calls for the awarding of
14 fellovvslrips of $3,000 each to
seniors in American and Cana-
dian colleges and universities;
the program is adrpinristered by
the College English Association.

Preliminary screening will be
done by a board of 21 regional
judges, three from each of seven
geographic areas, which have

approximately equal student pop-
ulation.

The Book-of-the-Month Club
Writing Fellowships were cre-
ated with the though, Mr. Scher-
ated with the thought, Mr.
Scherman said, that there are
many fellowships available for
those who wish to pursue sci-
entific and scholarly investiga
tions but relatively few are
available to the young creative
writer. “We hope this program
will help rectify this situation-
We .have designed it to give the

gifted college senior -an oppor-
tunity to develop his creative
talents in the year following his
graduation.”

Letter Grades Abolished

NEW HAVEN (cps) —
The Yale University faculty
has voted to replace numer-
ical grading with a system
under which students will be
given one of four designa-
tions for their work~fa-il, pass,
high pass or honors.

The new system will begin
next year and continue on an
experimental basis for at le-ast
ﬁve years.

Yoale’s present system makes
use of grading scale from 40 to
100, with 60 as the lowest pass-

ing grade. The university at
present compiles cumulative
averages for each student, but
it will no longer do when the
new system goes into effect.

The change at Yale is largely
the result of recommendations
made by the faculty's Course of
Study Committee, according to
Stroke Tallbott, chairman of the
Yale Daily News. Some student
organizations have been work-
ing to end the numerical system,
however.

Derek Shearer, head of the
Student Advisory Board, said

the new system “mo-ves away
from the pseudo-scientiﬁc claims
of the numbers system.” He
added that “It should make for
an improved class -atmosphere,
for there will be no more quib-
bling about numbers. There
would, I hope, he more concern
for the quality of ’a student's
work in terms of «his ability.
Still undecided is the question
where or not the university's
two academic honor li-sts -— the
dean's list and ranking scholar
designation —— are to be con-
tinued. Talbott is "hopeful they
will be abolished, but indicated
that the new grading system will
have important consequences for
students regardless of what is
done about the honor lists.
When students apply to grad-
uate school in the future, ac-

cording to Talbott, “recommen- _

dations are going to be much
more important than they have
been. Graduate schools are go-
ing to have to look much more
closely at what faculty members
say about a. student’s work.”
The new system is also like-
ly to end the camipus-wide com-
petition for grades. A student's
performance will be compared
with the performances of other
students in his department. Ant
present, Talbott; pointed out,
students are ranked by grade
average in spite of the fact that
so-rne departments give general-
ly higher grades than others.

Group Holds
Summer Dig
In England

The Association for Cultural
Exchange, a British n-on-proﬁt
organization, is sponsoring a
summer exchange program with
study and ﬁeld experience in
archeology.

The volunteers will ﬁrst join
«a threeJweek seminar for train-
ing in British archaeology and
excavation ‘techniques -at Queen's
College, Oxford, England. They
then split up into small groups
for three or more weeks of ac-
tual digging at an archaeologic-
al site. Urban expan-sion is en-
croaching on some of these sites,
so this may be the last oppor-
tunity to investigate them.

The total cost of the pro-gram -

is $725, including round-vtrip air
transportation from New York
City. Partial scholarships are
available to suitable students
with a B-plus average. Further
details will be provided on re-
quest from the United States
representative, Association for
Cultural Exchange, 539 West

“' 112th St., New York, N. Y. 10025.

The closing date for applica-
tions is January, 1968.

by WALTER IGRAN T
WASHINGTON (CPS) -— 'I‘lhe
_-American Association of Univer-
sity Professors (AAUP) has
condemned recent student dem-

' konstrations design to stop inter-

views or to prevent speakers in-
vlited to the campus from speak-
ing.

The AAUP, which has long

.. been one of the most liberal or-
, ganizations in the academic com-

munity, warned that recent pro-

tests at several campus across

the nation are destructive to the

*~ principles of academic freedom,

The AAUP D-OS_lll1ll0|1‘1 was is-
sued in the form of a resolurtion
adopted by the AAUP Council,
the organization’s policy-makling
board, which consists of 30 elect-
ed representatives. National Stu-
dent Association (NSA) ‘Presi-
dent Edward Schwartz endorsed
the resolution, when he was ask-
ed for comment. -

The resolution says “action
by individuals or groups to pre-
vent speakers invited to the
campus from speaking, to dis-
rupt the operations of the insti-
tutions in the course of demon-
strations, or to obstruct and re-
strain other members of the
academic community and cam-
pus visitons by physical force is
destructive of the pursuit of
learning of a free society. All
components of the academic
community are under a strong

Page 10 -— THE PITT NEWS_— Friday, November 10, 1967

AAUP Condemns Demonstrations
Stopping Campus Job Interviews

obligation to protect its ‘proces-
ses from these tactics.”

The resolution, through its
vague wording, refers to faculty
members as well as students.
Faculty members have joined
students in several recent p-ro-
tests.

The A.-AUP position comes in
the wake of a series of protests
against recruiters from the arm-
ed services and from other or-
ganizations connected with the
military. Some of the demon-
strations have been successful
in keeping recruiters from con-
ducting interviews or in tem-
porarily shutting down a build-
ing where military research is
conducted.

Robert Van Waes, associate
secretary of the AAUP, said,
“We’re all for dissent. But we
think -all persons, regardless of
their beliefs, should have the
same freedoms. Our concern is
that the larger freedom (free-
dom of speech) not be eroded
away by particular forms of
protest which we think may be
a challenge to that larger free-
dom.

Van Waes emphasized that
the AAUP has been promoting
greater academic freedom for
students. The orglanlization is
one of five behind a joint state-

ment on the rights and free-

do-ms of students. This state-
ment endorses such rights as a

 

student role in policy-making
and due process for students in
disciplinary cases.

In endorsing the AAUP stand,
Schwartz said, “While there are
some points where we (NSA)
would support a student strike
if it was necessary to achieve a
tactical objective for student
power or educational reform,
we can in no way support dem-
onstrations where the goal is to
prevent students from seeing re-
cruiters or to expel recruiters
from campus because of the or-
ganization which they repre-
sent.”

Schwartz explained his view
by asking, “In what way does
the left’:s~attempt to rid the uni-
versity of recruiters whom they
oppose differ from the right’-s
frequent attempts to ban Com-
munists from the campus?”

He added that there are ways
of confronting recruiters, even
lsiatting down -in front of them,
without blocking the plassage of
students who want to speak
with them.

Schwartz’ proposal would seri-
ously effect military recruiters,
who generally are not per:ni.t-
ted to discuss important milli-
tary policies like the Vietnam
war. The war is the primary
concern of the student protests.

Draft Information Centers
Open In Pittsburgh Area

Two new draft information centers have opened in the
Pittsburgh area. One is at the United Oakland Ministry, and
the other at the University. These centers will distribute
details on a man’s rights and obligations under the new Se-

lective Service Act.

» Men -will be available for interviews with students who
have questions on qualifications for student deferment, pro-
cedures for making appeal, risks of early induction for those
classified 1—A, and details about conscientious objection.

Tlhe counselors are able to
draw on experience gathered by
similar centers at colleges
throughout the country. They
believe thlat the stu-dents may

’ feel less hesitant to approach a

professor in their department,
and so counselors have been
drawn from many different de-
partments. .

The counselors will provide
the information publically avail-
able, but will not attempt to
persuade the students to take a
given sta.nd., This service is in

keeping with the request for
an informed public expressed by
Lt. General Lewis B. Hershey,
national director of Selective
Service.

Information on the program.

versity faculty members parti-

Hampered with injuries
to key players the freshman
football team, battles Ohio
State this afternoon at 2:30 p.m.
at Colum-bus, Ohio. The Acorns
promise to be tough.

In their ﬁnst and only game,
Ohio State displayed a power-
ful running attack that netted
333 yards and scored four
touchdowns on the ground while
trouncing Indiana, 26-7. Coach
Darrell Lewis plans to change
the -Cub defense in an effort to
contain them.

One switch will be Bill Bein-
ecke from offense to defense.
Beinecke will add more beef to
the front four.

Lewis expects to change the

Wozniak, who was injured and
unable to play against Penn
State, will join Lloyd Weston,
Ralph Cindrich, and Dave Mc-
Grath.

“We'll use an eight man line
against Ohio State,” said Lewis.

But the real problem of the.

Cubs will be the injuries to full-
back Tony Esposito and quarter-
back Don Plusquellic.

“Esposito will be ready for
Ohio State; he’ll be able to run
hard,” .reported trainer Willie
Meyers. “But Plusquellic deﬁn-
itely won’t be able to play for
the next two weeks. He injured
his knee cap in practice.”

“My quarterback will be Ban-

calls for it.

Dave Havern was a quarter-

ed -at that position against West

but somewhat inexperienced de-
fensive line.

Tackle Eric Norri weighs 255,
while ends Bob Kuechenberg
and Chuck Lauck are 245 and
225, respectively. None, how-
ever, started last year.

The strength -of the Irish de
fense, according to Panther as-
sistant coach Bill Lewis who
scouted them is the linebacking
corps and the secondary. The
Irish use a 4-4-3 defense, and
three of last year's linebackers
are back. .

Leading the group is All-

was intercepted twice.

The injury to Esposito was a
factor in the loss to Penn State,
and the loss of Plusquellic could
hurt just as much. And the
Acorns should be just as tough,

if not tougher, than the Little ”\ ,

The pros consider Jim Smith-

Schoen. He is bigger, at 6’l”, and
hits just as hard. Tom O’Lea-ry
i-sn’t ﬂashy but is very steady.

Kicking chores are handled by
another local boy, Joe Azzaro.
His ﬁelld goal beat the Panthers
two years ago.

With all his talent, Ara Parse-
ghian is still worried. “We may
be forced indoors this week for
the ﬁrst time in four years be-
cause of the snow-covered prac-
tice areas,” .he reported. Four
inches of snow has fallen on
South Bend in the last ﬁve -days.

Today's Notre Dame students
may consider Parseghian almost
a god, but there are some old-
timers around who swe-ar that
Knute Rockne could have stop-
ped that snowstorm.

” Soccer Team Battles

Kent State Here Today

Trying to bounce back from last week’s 2-0 loss to

Akron the soccer team goes against the State Golden Flash-
es at Forbes Field today at 3 pm,
‘The booters will be without the services of Ernie Mouein, the

junior halfback who has been a
valuable asset to the defense all
year. Mouen is in the hosiplitall
but should be ready for the sea-
son ﬁnal at Penn State next
Week. _
Kent State will bring an over-

“ all record of six wins and three

losses here today. Ohio U., a
team which the boovtens played
to a 1-1 tie, defeated Kent State,
2-0.

Either Ron Mielecki ‘or Mike
Schalk should be called upon to
fill the halfback spot vacated by
Mouen. Norm Roux may be
moved from fullback to half-
back with Schalk moving to
fullback, a position he played
earlier‘ in the season.

Coach Leo Bemis, who has

Last home game.

game this year while losing six
and tying two, was optimistic
about the game. Bemis said the
booters “looked good as a team”
in the loss to Akron, and be in
a close game today.

“The team has been sharp in
practice this week," -he com-
mented, “In fact, they have look-
ed much better all year than
the record shows.’’

The frosh hooters will play
the Kent State frosh at ,1 p.m.,
prior to the varsity game. Ran-
dy Dry, a forward who has
-shown scoring potential, leads
the frosh offense.

Aknon’s freshman defeated
the frosh, 3-2, with a 1ast-min-
ute goal last week and ruined
a hard fought comeback, which
resulted in a 2-2 deadlock in
the late minutes. Dry had one
of the goals during the drive.

Barinig injury, Bemis said, Dry
will be called upon next year
to replace Gary Foerts-ch or
Pete Snyder, seniors, who will
play their last home game to-
day. Bemis said with hard work
between now and next season,
Dry could aid the booterls as a
starter -at forward.

Scoring potential should be a
welcome addition to the soccer
team next year. A lack" of goals
(ﬁve in nine games) has caused‘
the boorters to lose all but three
of their games this season.

The freswman soccer team
will not have a winning rec-
ord this year. They have one
win and three defeats, but they
will not give up when they face
Kent State today in the ﬁnal
game of the season.

“The boys played as well as I
could have expected against Ak-
ron,” commented coach Jim
Snyder. “They were as good if
not better than they were in
our win against Slippery -Rock,
bu=t Akron was just a better
team.”

The frosh suffered another
setback last Saturday when half-
back Dave Dowhan, one of
Snyder’es defensive mainstays,
pulled a hamstring musc1e,in
the ﬁrst quarter and had to
leave the game. Snyder will send
in Al Smith to play Dowhan’s
spot today.

“Smith has been the most im-
proved player on the team the
last three weeks,” the coach
commented. “He can move the
ball much more quickly now
than he could in the beginning
of the season.”

Snyder re-fused to single out
any one player as the outstan-d-
in-g man on the team. “Carlos
Anselmo gave us a big lift with
those two goals against Slippery
Ro-ck, and Dick Pasternak has
been good at goalie all season,
but I have to give credit to the
whole team. They are playing as
a unit out there,” he comment-
ed. -
The Kent State frosh were

rated as equal to Slippery Rock

‘by Snyder. “They play a con-

trolled game. Like Slip p e ry

 Frosh B-ooters Poised
   To Face Ohioans Today

Rock, they try to keep the ball
on the ground and work toward
the right and left wings,” he
said. Snyder plans to use the
four halfback (4-3-3) defense
against Kent State.

Today's game will be a re-
venge game of -sorts. “Kent State
is in Ohio, and I told the boys
to remember Akron when they
go out there against them.”

are Roy “J ump-Shot” Jacobs and
Mike “Hawk” Brourman, the
deadliest duo outside of Taylor-
Burton. A-t safety will be John
“Physique” Selisky and Jerry
“Leroy” Gruebel, that is if “Le-
roy” can recover from an acute
case of lack of talent.

“Flatbush” has promised to
open up his offense. “I’d rather
lose 63-48 than win 7-0,” he Said.

' George “Moustachio” Lies will

guide the team at quarterback,
but “Flatbush” is keeping the
rest of the linup a secret. “Does
Macy's tell Gimbel’s?” he asked.

Also unknown is where the
Wily mentor wil-1 play. Many
have suggested that with his
blazing speed, he is playing o-n
the wrong game. “He should
be with the Steelers,’ is the
consensus.

“I’m in the right game," he
answered. “The Steelers are in
the wrong game. They should
all be plumbers.”

Wherever he is, “Fla.tbush”
will be visible with number 12
on his back. “Just me and Joe
Willie," he laughed.

week's Pleasure Palace Pan-
ther of the Week Award. El-
lis recovered the fumble to

od. “I throw knives now,” she
said cuttingly.

“Moustachio” is still looking
for the culprit who ate all the
cake before he got any. “My
pieces have been few and far
between lately,” yie lamented.

Cheerleader Linda Rodgers,
who picked for the girls, took
the Panthers, but with some
trepidation. “I certainly hope-
Notre Dame shows up," she
said. “But I don’t know how
we’ll do against such a sweet
girls school.”

by GEORGE LIES, Associate Sports Editor

Ara Parseghian brings N otre Dame's group of excit-
ing players to the Stadium tomorrow, and no one bothered
to ask Dave Hart whether the Panthers could win. It seem-

ed a silly question to ask.

Game (time is 1:30 p.m., and f

Panthers are underdogs. But,
unlike other games, the odds-
makers did not release a point
spread; lately, the Jungle Cats
have made a mess of things,
narrowly losing to favorites,
Navy and Syra-cuse, on costly
mistakes.

“We can’t make a mistake
against Notre Dame,” empha-
sized Haart. “Not one.”

Last week, improper cover-
age on a punt return lost in
game for the Cats. “It was a
costly mistake,” Hart continued.
“We just can't -afford major
mistakes against them. And {it
seems, every mistake we make

is a major one.”

Last Saturday, Notre Dame

turned Navy mistakes into a

43-14 win. Early errors by the

Michigan Junior, who has caught 31 passes.

   

or the seventh straight week, the

Midshipmen proved costly as the
Irish defense grabbed advantage
of the breaks.

Tomorrow, people like Tom
Schoen, Tom O’Leary, and Kev-
in Hardy on’ defense, and Terry
Hanratty, Jim Seymour, and
Jeff Zimmerman on offense will
try to force those same mis-
takes on -the Panthers.

For instance, the Fighting
Irish will be on the lookout for
tailback Gary Cramer, who is
remembered best rfor his 139
yards against Navy. They’ll be
waiting for split end Bob Lon-
go, who owns ﬁve school rec-
ords for receptions. And they'll
be watchful ~ of wlngback Joe
McCain, who has quietly aver-
aged 5.2 yards per carry, and
who has caught 13 passes for
180 yards.

Notre Dame also will be wa:i)t-
ing for the Panthers’ defense.
It is basically the same defense
which held the country's num-
ber one team last year to a 7-0
hlalf-time lead in Slotufah Bend.

“I feel we can still do things
to hurt their running game, and
cause them problems,” noted
Bill Lewis, the assistant coach
who -scouted Notre Dame.

“We’ll just have to get a tre-
mendous effort from our rush-
ing line,’’ he said.

“Our secondary has been con-
sistent all year, but, of course,
there is that Navy game,” said
Lewis. The secondary  al-
lowed 65 completed passes of
134 attempts, but has given-up
only 30 of the opponents’ 194
points.

“Our players have been play-
ing 100 per cent; they've given
great efforts the last two weeks,
and I wonder what they’re
thinking,” Hart said this week.

GARY CRAMER
One To Watch

“We're not making mistakes
of submission like we did last
year. We are making mistakes
of omission,” continued Hart.

“They’re young, but yet they’-ve
bamtled opponents. They've been
making aggressive msi—st—akes,”
Hart explained.

“Tlhey get burned by a mis-
take, but they mature -right
there because of it. And now
it's unfortunate for us that

Notre Dame is better than they
were two weeks ago,” he said.

Another sophomore, 6-1, 212
pound Ed Sadowski will get his
first start at offensive guard’
due to the knee injury to senior
Ray Radakovich. With George
Medich returning from the dis-
abled list, Hart will thus start
nine sophomores on offense.

Against Syracuse, it was soph
Jeﬁ Barr who made a few mis-
takes in his passing game, burt
the Orange -c-ou=l~dn’rt score.
Against Notre Dame, that does-
n’t happen too often.
