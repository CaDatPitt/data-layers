Governance Amendment May
Violate Federal and State Law

By MARGI STUMPF

Pitt News Staff Writer

The proposed goverance group
funding amendment to the Student
Government Constitution will be

withdrawn sometime today accor- -

ding to board member Bernie
Popko. ‘

Popko said that the measure will
be withdrawn due to negative
reactions and bad publicity re-
ceived over the past weeks.

At Fridays SGB meeting two
sections of the proposed amend-
ment were declared illegal.

Board member Dave Hesidence
told the SGB Friday that Section
Two of the amendment, which
defines Black Action Society
membership as being open to all
full-time undergraduate students
at the university who are black,
may be in violation of the
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare Title, which are
regulations based on the 1964 Civil
Rights Act.

Office of Student Affairs advisor
Nancy Evans informed him in a
meeting last week that “it is illegal

for any institution distributing
funds to discriminate on the basis
of race,” Hesidence said.

“Because Pitt receives some
federal money it comes under
federal guidelines,” he added.

“BAS membership as it is now is
defined as any one who wants to be
in it. It is open to all students,”
Hesidence said yesterday in
explaining why section two may be
illegal.

Hesidence said the section could‘

be rewritten to redeﬁne BAS
membership but he added a change
in the amendment may mean
gathering more signatures on a

ipetition to support the revised

amendment. The amendment then
would pass through necessary
channels again.

_Section Four, Part E of the
proposed amendment states:'

“The officers of a governance
group receiving funding shall be
personally liable and responsible
for any funds received by their
organization, and the SGB,l'SGB
Allocations Committee, SGB Ju-
diciary and/or Campus Judicial

System (as appropriate) shall have
full authority to prosecute those
officers charged with violations.”
“As that reads it is in violation of 
state law,” Hesidence said. “I
don't know A exactly what the '
specific law is, but fundamentally H
with any mandatory fee charged to 
state-owned or state-related uni-
versity students, the liability lies
with the university itself, not with .
the student body.
“The university acts as a 
collecting body and  the liability 5"‘
for fees. What I’iﬁn-‘7g’oingW"on is
information from‘. the Office of
Student Affairs.” "J ‘

Gary Houston, assistant to the J
vice-chancellor of student affairs,
confirmed yesterday that such a
law is in state books and it makes
the collection and liability for
mandatory fees “a judiciary re-
sponsibility of the university, and
the university can’t do away with
it.”

Houston said there was “no I
way” students could take on
liability and control of activities
fees.

 

if Dve esidence told board member
Friday that sections of the proposed goverance group funding amendment
were illegal. According to board member Bernie Popko all action to push the
amendment through for passage will be curtailed today. ' .

WPGH-FM Proposal,

Survey Says Rock's Number One

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Student Government Board
adopted Friday a proposal to
convert the student-owned radio
station WPGH from a carrier
current system to an open-air FM
station. _

Former General Manager Jeff
Couch submitted an eight page
proposal. to the board which
outlined the changes to be made in
the station’s operations. '

“The initial start-up cost will be
$20,000, paid by the university,”
Couch said. “Other costs will be

handled by student government,
student activities and grants.”

The proposal lists problems of
limited audience and limited
advertising revenue as current
problems of the station that may be
eliminated by the establishment of
an open-air station.

‘The proposal also states the
carrier current system currently
used is “quite fragile and
impractical for a college station
with limited maintenance person-
nel. The amount of time required
to test the system weekly distracts
the engineers from keeping the

studio in perfect operating order.”

A sample program schedule
included in the proposal gives
on-air time as 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. and
lists a range of programming
including popular’ and classical
music, news reports, educational
shows and lecture series conducted
by’ Pitt faculty.

Couch said the proposal will
move from the board to the Office
of Student Activities and then to
the Board of Trustees for ﬁnal
approval.

He added that the university will

SGB president Josh Baylson

I remarked before the board’s vote:

“In asking the board for approval I
would like to note approval does
not obligate the board to further
expenditures.”

In other business the board
listened to a report by member Jan
Medoff on a music survey
conducted last term.

“This is a start of the Pitt Union
Programming Council survey,”
Medoff said.

Terry Milani, Associate Director
of Student Activities, said in an

earlier interview that a survey of
student entertainment tastes would
be conducted under the soon-to-be
revamped program council.

Eighty‘ percent of students
surveyed indicated rock music was
their favorite, Medoff said.
WDVE-FM was the most listened-
to Pittsburgh radio station with
WYDD and WFFM takingsecond
and third place respectively on the
poll, he added._

The staging of concerts on
campus was favored over the
purchasing of tickets for events
downtown, Medoff said. He said
students favored concerts in
Oakland because the area is more
convenient and familiar to stu-
dents.

Students also indicated they
would be willing to pay between

“For a band people really want
to see, people would be willing to
pay more,” Medoff said. “But we
do have to be realistic. People

.don’t always have the bucks to

spend on concerts.”

He added that copies of the
survey would be forwarded to the
program council’s entertainment
committee, Milani and WPGH-
radio.

The board also heard a statement

-delivered by member Stan Galanski

from member Bernie Popko con-
cerning the absence of representa-
tives from the Engineering Student
Cabinet at last week’s Student

Government Board Assembly
meeting.

The special meeting had been
called by SGB Judiciary for the
cabinet to discuss a proposed
amendment to the SGB constitution
which would change allocations
processes for the board’s seven
governance groups. The meeting
was chaired by Galanski.

“Mr. Popko has asked me to
make a statement that cabinet
members were not informed of the
meeting,” Galanski said.

Board member Dave Hesidence
reported that the Office of Student
Activities indicated to him in a
meeting last week that two sections
of the proposed amendment may
be illegal. I

The board voted 3-1 to adopt a
memo written by Hesidence to the
Judiciary Committee, asking that
the amendment note be called for a
student referendum.

A _federal agency has denied

'0 allegations by a Pitt researcher that
‘he was released from a $6 million

program because he refused to

conceal findings of radiation

danger to workers.

The General Accounting Office
in Washington said that Dr.
Thomas, Mancuso was ﬁred by the
former Atomic Energy Commission
because of poor project manage-
ment on his part. ,

Mancuso has failed to comment
on the federal inspection pending

his inspection of the report.

The GAO questioned the actions
of the Department of Energy,
successor of the Atomic Energy
Commission, in turning the Man~
cuso case over to a private research
ﬁrm heavily linked with the nuclear
agency.

The study was initially begun by
the GAO last August after‘ a
testimony by Mancuso before a
House subcommittee on health and
environment. Mancuso claimed
that he was dropped from an AEC

research project in 1977 solely for
the reason that he would not make
the preliminary ﬁndings of the
study public.

The AEC attempted to refute
another study stating that low level
radiation is dangerous to workers.
Based on the findings of his
research, Mancuso believed that
this radiation posed no threat to
workers. _

Mancuso published a partial
summary of his study -in 1976 that
noted a rise in certain types of

J

cancer among workers exposed to
certain low level radiation at the
government's nuclear plant in
Hanford, Washington.

Mancuso also charged that the
contractor chosen to compete his
study was biased against his
preliminary ﬁndings.

In the Mancuso report, the G50
said that federal officials were
openly unhappy with Mancuso’s
work beginning in 1972. At this
time there had been discussion of
ﬁring him.

Government Involves Pitt Researcher in Radiation Dispute

The initial report said the
contractors assigned to the study
received 70 to 80 percent of their
operating funds from the govern-
ment nuclear agency but also said

that the contractors were deﬁnitely ‘‘

qualiﬁed to handle the work.
..There was no mention made of

the Energy Department documents

by the G50, which said that one of

  Changing
Allocations

The death knell for the governance group funding
amendment apparently has been sounded. Student
Government Board member Bernie Popko said last
night that the amendment will be withdrawn some

,time today. Popko said the adverse reactions and
“bad publicity” ..that the amendment received were
the reasons why the amendment would be scrapped
and added that he did not expect that the amendment
to be reborn in any similar form in the future. 1

Perhaps the act that finally destroyed the amend-
ment was the vote by the SGB Friday to suggest to
the Judiciary Committee that the amendment not be
raised as a referendum issue in a- special election.

‘ The board made this move because two sections of

the governance group funding proposal possibly_were

' ‘ illegal. ,One section apparently violated Title IX

regulationsof the Department of Health, Education
’ and_Welfare while a second one broke a state law that
— makes the University ultimately responsible for the

0 handling of any funds collected by the institution.
This ignominous end to the funding proposal-'

“marks the finish of the first serious attempt to reform

support the amendment received from engineers
shows that this reform is needed desperately.

I
We support the idea of reform of the allocations
process; it IS the specific methods that theengineers

proposed to which we objected in the past. The plan ..

was’ fraught with weaknesses and the imbalance in
the funding to the Nursing Students Organization is
just one example of the lack of thought in the plan.
Under the governance group funding amendment,
the nurses would have received a 1,000 percent in-
crease in allocations.

The greatest ‘problem with the allocations
procedures as they now exist is the general
inavailability of information about the proposed
budget before it is passed by the board. There is no
systematic disclosure of the proposedibudget. In-
stead, every organization from the Black Action
Society to the Amateur Radio Association has their
allocation reviewed individually and either approvedi

’ or rejected by the board in open hearings.

To correct this problem, open hearings on the total
student government budget should be held twice.
At these hearings students could demonstrate

whether they agree with the way their money is to be ,
spent in the next year. Theseopen hearings, when

combined with the individual hearings that now exist,
should give more than adequate review of the
allocations process. . "

,Still,.t.his.reform- would do no good if the hearings

» V Cindi Evangelista, Photo Editor

The allocations hearings must be scheduled in the fall
orwinter term if students can oversee the spending of
their money effectively. '

To institute these reforms and any others that
might be‘ necessary, the new SGB members should
convene an ad hoc committee on allocations when
they take office this winter. This committee then
could move to develop a funding amendment to be
put on a referendumtnext November, the date for
SGB elections under the new constitution. Any ac-
tion less than that cheats the 1,000 students who
shchaved their support for allocations reform when
they signed petitions backing the governance group
funding arngid_n_1e_nt‘last month:

as a student, to find them.

Unfortunately, Miller , doesn’t
want to “play the game” of finding
the best teachers. TINSTAAFL,
Jerry! Learn it/now, before the
“game” is for jobs instead of
classes! L ‘M

The endless reference Miller
makes to a mythical 1,000 students
who left is an incredible error in
interpretation. Many more than
1,000 left; that is the number who
weren’t replaced by new students.
He also can’t seem to understand
that there are many reasons why

students leave. ,

The university is concerned
about students leaving. ‘Marilyn
Brown, director of V Institutional
Research at Pitt, told me, “There is
an attrition study being proposed
but at the present time we don’t
know why students dropped out.”
The chancellor’s report of which

it are held during the spring term as they are currently.

Miller so ‘easily disposed pointed

. out that Pitt is just oneexample of a
national trend of lower enrollment.

Why_do -students leave? ‘Miller
may be quite accurate in his
consideration of tuition changes,
but there A are other reasonable
possibilities «also. Across the
nation students’ - SAT’ scores‘ and
class rank have dropped.

These students may ﬁnd college

prepared. They might discover
that a college degree is not
important in their job market any
more. A few may, in fact, be
discouraged with theteachers they

encounter but as far as lam

concernedt t is their own fault.
Jerry Miller is deluding himself
when he tries to blame all
drop-outs_on poor teaching and
higher» tuition.

If Miller wants to see bad»

teaching, let him go to the
community college where he thinks
everyone gets “A’s, B’s--and a few
C’s--.” He’ll quickly discover that

it is much worse than Pitt, except in‘

a few very specialized areas.

I am expecially irritated with
Miller’s assessment of Chemistry
11 and 12. Although he says it is
“so impossibly difficult that
everyone does poorly-,” (not true,

Miller’s Pessimistic View of Pitt

I’ve found) he admits the existence
of a bell curve. Would he seriously
have us believe that the people at
the upper end of that curve did not
learn much?

Does he actually think that the
goal in the course is to get a normal
distribution of lousy grades? If so,

.he’s stuck his head in the -wrong

alligator’s mouth.

Professor Lawrence Epstein, ~

Chemistry 11 course coordinator, is
a former chairman, of the Faculty /of
Arts and Sciences Committee on
Grading. He believes that the
natural sciences, have done more
than some other departments to_
roll back grade inﬂation. '
Epstein told me, “I personally

am not committed to a particular ,

grade distribution.” He also said
that he allows for variation among
classes. In other words, there is
no “tactic” designed to cover up
bad teaching.

I will not lend any glory to
Miller’s wild statements concern-
ing the University officials who do
” His extremist

“.8

.attitude renders him entirely

unbelievable. ‘

My last words to Jerry and his
sympathizers are to suggest “that
they follow my example. I quit
school two years ago to --do
something I thought would be
really exciting. I was a paramedic
for that time, in hospital emergen-
cy rooms and ambulances. It was
exciting but I find Pitt much more

thrilling. When  “playthe game” ’

here, the rewards are much
greater. P . .

Finally, it is infuriating to find

‘that my money goes” to print the

paper in which Miller’s prattle
appears. I would not for a moment

. deny his right to be heard, despite

his logical errors. » .
However, his ‘point could have
been made much briefer, and there

was no reason for The Pitt News to '

label it “engrossing.” How does
the paper justify the devotion of
over two thousands words to this
malcontent?

Nick Arnett ‘
_C~AS 

Political Posters at Pitt  

Upon reading the letter to the
editor concerning the arrest of
Iranians and Anti-Imperialist Stu-
dent Union *mem_bers for posting
political bills around the. Pitt
campus (Jan. 29), a number of
different thoughts passed through
my mind. .

First, I thought of our right to
free speech which was won 200
years ago in America. This
essential freedom has been upheld
through our country’s history in

almost all.-c.ases except when the ,

nation’s security was involved.

But then I thought of the
mornings that I walked to school
and had to put up with hundreds of
the same political posters plastered
on everything that had a three by
two ﬂat surface along the street.
No doubt, the volume of posters
put up was for impact, but I
personally am not attracted to this
avant-garde indoctrination techni-
que. E

The Iranian students in Pitts-

burgh who hope to rally support for 0‘

causes in their homeland will be
hindered by the actions of their

countrymen in ‘ California a few

weeks ago. The vivid video tapes
of fires and turned-over cars
outside the Shah’s mothers’ house
is bound to _-enrage American
viewers. *

Even though America is a
republic and we had to fight to end
the rule of an unwanted king,;there
will be little sympathy for people
who try to carry their own
revolutions to our country.

In conclusiori, I think wall
posters and announcements that
are put in their designated places
will -certainly not lead to harass-
ment or arrest regardless of their
content. If they are. there are
always legal alternatives.

The Record Graveyard Fights Album Inflation 

By SAM ROSSI
Pitt News Staff Writer
Like everything else today,
prices for record albums are
steadily increasing. But in the
midst of inﬂated record prices
there stands The Record Grave-
yard. —
Located at 4611 Forbes Ave. atop
Allies Bar, The Graveyard buys
and sells used records for

 

somewhat limited budget.

extremely reasonable prices.

The Graveyard carries all types
of music: jazz, disco, oldies, rock,
soul, country and even classical.

The store should be particularly
appealing to the student on a
Single
albums sell for about $2.50, with
455 going for only 25 cents. All
records are in fine to very good
condition, and all are guaranteed to

play. Also, while rummaging
throughthe record "bins, one may
ﬁnd rare collector’s editions, worth
far more than the price marked.

Jerry Weber and Jim Petruzzi
ownand operate The Graveyard.
Mailmen by day, both find time to
work the store’s evening shift. Avid
music lovers and collectors, both
enjoy running The Graveyard
immensely.

NTERTAlNMENT

The Graveyard opened in Sep-
tember of 1977 as a result of an
injury to Weber that kept him from
delivering mail. With little to
occupy his time, Weber made plans
to sell some of his own monstrous
record collection, which eventually
led to the opening of The
Graveyard.

Weber contends that business
has been pretty good so far, but he

hasn't gotten the response from
Pitt students that he had expected,
possibly due to the location.

Petruzzi safely estimates that
they take in between 400‘ to 500
albums per week. Glancing about
the store one finds the ﬁgure easily
accepted in view of the large. record
stock present.

The Graveyard represents a true
bargain to record collectors.

Audience Participates In ‘The American Dream ’

Directed by Bill Royston

One of the best things about
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater’s
production of Edward Albee’s

Strangers in the Night
UFO '

Chrysalis Records

, As was expected, the phenomen-
at success of Peter Frampton’s
“Frampton Comes Alive” album
has brought about a ﬂood of double
live releases for the record buying
public. In the past few years,

and Dave Mason to the Michael
Stanley Band and Bruce Cockbiurn
havemade their attempts at instant
mass popularity by putting their
live performances on vinyl- Some
of these were moderately success-
ful, .but most were nothing to get
excited over. q

The latest offering from UFO, a

double live album titled “Strangers

'in the Night,” is one of the finest
‘iconcert recordings to hit record

“The American Dream” is that you
don’t just, watch the play, you
become an intimate part of it.
Before the performance begins,
each member of the audience goes
through a receiving line and meets
the three principal characters of the
play. You’ll shake hands and chat

with Mommy, Daddy and Grandma
before taking your seat.

Once you’ve taken your seat,
however, don’t expect to be in it for
the remainder of the evening to
passively watch the play.

Director Bill Royston has based
his production not only on “The

- American Dream,” but also on

“The Sandbox,” another play by
Albee which employs the same
characters and theme. The two
plays are meshed in the perform-
ance andithe acting for each takes
place in opposite corners of the
theater. When the actors move

. from one set to another, so does the

audience. ,

Thus, 1 says. Royston,
audience ‘ 1
play, sees a process evo1ve.”. And
they become a part of it. 1

You don’t have to get up and
move, but it’s certainly to your
advantage. The resulting intimacy
of this arrangement is unequaled
by any other running production.

“The American Dream” is a
vivid and sardonic look at the
“All-American Family.” It’s both
funny and frightening. 1

Mommy (Caryl Opshinsky) is
selfish, mean and two-faced. She’s
aggressive and brazen. Her
husband, Daddy (Harry Cohen), is
the exactopposite. He’s cowering
and stupid. He is a man who has
been manipulated so much he can
no longer think or act for himself.

' Grandma, delightfully played by

the

Romona Fischer, is Albee’s best

character in this play. She wins the
audience's love and sympathy in

permanently. Paul Chapman has
since been named his successor.

Old folks “don’t just burn-up or

They live, and with a strong sense
of dignity. It is only when that

New Valerie Carter Release
Is Musically Satisfying

By FORREST BUFFENMYER
Pitt News Staff Writer
Wild Child
Valerie Carter
ARC Records

Valerie Carter has just released a
new album. “Wild Child,” and it
proves to be very musically
satisfying.

This album follows 1977's
release. “Just A Stone's Throw
Away,” which had critics raving
over various aspects of the record,
including her “soul-based power
and vocal range,” to quote
“Rolling Stone” magazine.

This new release is no exception.
Carter’s lyrics conjure up great
imagery, such as in “What's

Become of Us.” She has a clear
high voice; a cross between Ann
Wilson of Heart and Crystal Gayle,
with perhaps a little Linda Ronstadt
thrown in.

At times, Carter’s songs and
vocal delivery bring
Fleetwood Mac, with Christine
McVie’s or Stevie Nicks' style of

“Doctor Doctor”. “Love to Love”
concludes the first half of the

album on a mellower note, while '

the third side spotlights an
11-minute version of the crowd
pleasing “Rock Bottom, ’
ly from their first album, “Pheno-
menon.” ‘

Side four consists of jJFO’s
regular encore numbers: “Too Hot
To Handle," “I’m a Loser," “Let
It Roll,” and “Shoot Shoot.” UFO
fans will surely find most of their
favorites included in the album.

UFO plays hard-core rock ‘n’
roll, minus the fancy stage and
studio frills, and they do it in grand
style. “Strangers in the Night” is
a must for old UFO followers and a
great place to start for new ones.

rich, full vocals. Good solid
backbeats and accentuating guitar-
work also help to create this
impression. A good example of this
is “Lady in the Dark,” which
captures your attention almost
immediately with its background
vocals.

The theme within this album
seems to be some aspect of lost or
broken love-—but there is an
ufierlying optimism. The charac-
ters in these songs are not the kind
of people to split up calmly with
their lovers, or to just sit and wait
for them to return. The attitude is
more one of desperation, like “if

~ you won’t love me, I’m going
~ elsewhere, even though I still hurt

from you.”
Good pieces include “Crazy;”

L “What’s Become of Us;” “Taking

the Long Way Home;" “Lady in

A the Dark;” “Trying to Get to You,”

(which has been getting some

~ airplay); and the title track, “Wild

She has assembled an accom-
plished set of studio musicians,
most of whom are not well known;
but all play as well as most and
better than a good many. As a
result, she never has to struggle
with poor accompaniment, but can
concentrate on the lyrics of a song,
accentuating them to perfection.’

her sense of dignity. He can relate
to her on one very important point:
every human beings need to be

-faved. Both, though in different

circumstances, have been denied
this.

The scene with Grandma and the
young man is the most dramatic of
the entire performance. It stands
out from the absurd satire of the
play and puts before the audience a
grim and tragic reality. It will make
you question the laughs you are
sure to have while you are a part of
“The American Dream.”

 

above all else, or simply slices
through a solid backbeat. g

The real problem with this record
is not with the music, which is very
good, but with the packaging. ARC
Records apparently wishes to cash
in on a sexual image, and as a
result Carter is pictured on the
album jacket and on the inner-

sleeve as a juvenile delinquent
type—a tough female of loose
morals.

Don't be fooled by the appear-
ance. This record is full of slow
ballads as well as rocking love
tunes. None of the advertised

.sex-rock is delivered, which is no

great loss anyway.

When this basketball season is

_,

1 number of times Pitt pulled off big
surprises, both good and bad. The
Panthers’ 72-57 win over West
Virginia University was in itself no
great surprise but it might have
been a few weeks ago. ’

After Pitt blew a seemingly
substantial lead within the closing

minute of the Iona game Jan. 22, it

seemed incredible that the players
themselves could refrain from
wondering if the Panthers were
doomed to lose close games.

The team that stuck together
during the rough times did so again
Saturday night. Pitt delighted most

Lowes Moore-paced rally to send
the Mountaineers back to Morgan-
town with their third Eastern Eight
conference loss. ‘
(Wayne “Rat” Williams, who
had been having trouble with his
I free-throw shooting lately, was 10

 for 11 from the line and added six

field goals to ﬁnish the» game with
22 points, high for the Panthers»
Williams’ ﬁve assists and ﬁve
steals capped ,his fine overall
performance against WVU, a team
which started out impressively but
then couldn’t seem to do anything
right. i .
Midway through, the first half,
with the score 18-13 in favor of
WVU, the Panthers reeled off 14

consecutive points and were
scoring in a variety of ways: a
Carlton Neverson baseline shot,

’ two long baskets by Dave Olinger,

a 21-foot jumper by Williams, a
Neverson dunk and, of course,’
some foul shots by Williams.

Just when the Mountaineers had
recovered from this barrage from

. Pitt and had several opportunities

to chop away at the lead, the
Panthers were ‘again surprising.
They worked the ball around for a‘
ﬁnal ﬁrst-half shot.

The Panthers ﬁnally ended the ~

half with four points when Sam
Clancy arced in a foul-line jumper
with 23 seconds remaining and,
following a WVU turnover, guard
Pete Strickland made good on his
one and only shot of the evening.

The shot, a 23-foot effort killed.
any momentum the ‘Mountaineers

may have hoped for at the time.
“There were two turning points
in the game,” said coach Tim
Grgurich. “One was that ﬁnal
minute of the ﬁrst half when we put
in the two jumpers. We needed
momentum and that really did it.”
~West Virginia eventually came
back to within four points when
Lowes Moore deftly worked his way
around two Pittpdefenders to score
a layup and then picked up a pair of
free throws when Clancy com-
mitted his fourth personal foul.

“That was the other turning
point,” said Grgurich.

With Clancy in foul trouble, the
Panthers employed a deliberate
offense in which four players were
always moving, passing and
cutting while one man remained
stationary.) This drew numerous
fouls and the Panthers were able to
score over half their remaining
points from the free throw line.

“We went into a semi-stall
during the last seven minutes, ” the
Pitt coach said. “And as long as we

imade thefoul shots, we were in

pretty good shape.”

Defensively, the Panthers had to
contend with the shooting wizardry
of the Mountaineers’ Moore, a 6
foot, 1 inch guard who scored 25
points.

“Lowes is just a great player,”
said Strickland, who spent much of
his playing time keeping an eye on
WVU’s leading scorer. “One
player can’t beat us alone, though,

and with (Joe) Fryz out, they
weren’t gbing to beat us.”

Fryz, the other Mountaineer
starting guard, did not ‘play
because of an ankle injury.

Despite the importance of this
game in the league standings (Pitt
has moved past West Virginia into
third place), getting psyched for a
game two nights after the
Panthers’ emotional thriller with
Duquesne was not easy, said
Grgurich.

“It’s\tough to play two games
like this in a row,” the coach said.
“We were not as up as Thursday
night. In fact we were a little ﬂat,
especially at the start of the second
half.” -

Several weeks ago, one might
have expected the Panthers to fold
under pressure in that second half.

But now Pitt basketball fans can

expect the unexpected.

“Oh, I don’t know,” said Pete.
“I guess a lot like it felt for them

LOCK HAVEN, Pa.——Tom Elling
was the proudest man in Thomas
Field House after the Pitt wrestling
team’s 28-11 victory over Lock

, Haven Saturday night.

Elling watched as freshman
190-pounder Pat Connor, a mem-
ber of his Lock Haven High School
squad a year ago, decisioned Bald
Eagle Tim Thompson in a wild one,
10-7, in Lock Haven’s reputed
“House of Noise." .

Connor capped a fierce Panther
comeback against Thompson (16-4

“Pat’s style of wrestling is
collegiate.” Elling said. “In high
school, we coached 5 lot of
wrestling on your feet and escaping
on bottom—not a lot of mat

don’t make it in college.”

Con11or (7-9) had to face the

adversity of the same hometown
crowd that cheered him on only one

“We talked to him about that,”
Pitt head coach Dave Adams said.
“Pat just had to accept coming in

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s men's and women’s
gymnastics teams both lost this
weekend to nationally ranked
The Pantherettes
were beaten Friday by third-ranked
Clarion, 141.25-130.75, and their
record drops to 2-3.

The men were defeated at
20th-ranked Temple Saturday,
201.6-184.7. Their record is now
2-2.

While women’s coach Donna

DeMarino Sanft was pleased with

her team’s performance, Frank
D’Amico was not as happy with the

‘ Panthers.

\

“Injuries and a lack of depth hurt
us the most,” said D’Amico._ “I
was also surprised to see Temple’s
score so high and disappointed that
ours was low.”

In individual events, Allan
Meyers won both the floor‘ exercise
(8.9) and parallel bars (8.55).

‘Byron Johns placed second on the

sidehorse, scoring 7.95. Freshman
Joe Seminani, in his ﬁrst sidehorse
competition, took fourth with a 7.6.

Bob Besong, Meyers and ‘Dave
Rich placed second, third and
fourth, respectively in the rings.

'/Besong scored 8.8, Meyers 8.7 and

Rich 8.5 in what D’Amico called his
best routine to date.

Besong took second place in the
high bar with an 8.4 and third
all-around with a total score of
46.3.

Sanft said she was pleased with
the Pantherettes, especially be-
cause of the conditions under which
they had to compete.

“There was a large crowd. It
was the same situation as at Penn
State and our girls didn’t fold
under the pressure,” she said.
“We ran up our highest point total
this season and did it away from

home.” - .
Holly Martino had a super night, ‘

according to Sanft, as did Bonnie
Tressler, except for two breaks on

4 performed well.

 -~.... ,
w:

the beamand in the 3floor exercise.

Martino placed third in the
all-around with a total ,score of
34.25. She also took third place in

the vault (8.8) and in the uneven -

bars (8.55). In the floor exercise,
Martino had‘ her highest score this
season, an 8.75.

Two gymnasts returning to
competition after injuries also
Myra Bachuchin
scored an 8.5 in the“ vault, her
highest this year. Roxanne ‘Evans
also had her highest score of the
season, an 8.3, in the uneven bars.

Sanft lauded two Clarion per-
formers as “Just beautiful to
watch.” Ann Woods and Nancy

upstartcymnasts Downed as Cnmpetition Pullskankj

Jones placed ﬁrst and second in the
all-around, each scoring over 3" '
pgints. Woods averaged above 9.0
in each event.

Sanft also said two. freshmen
Pantherettes, Karen Zandi and
Dawn Reimer, did well. ‘Zandi
received a 7.6 in the floor exercise,
her best score of the season.

“We rely on Karen and Dawn a
lot,” said Sanft. “Theyreally have
pulled through for us and I’m ,
pleased with their progress. The

Swimmers Take Time Out For Practice at Clarion, I82-52

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s swimmers (7-0) ordinarily
work out at ‘ Trees Pool, but
Thursday they traveled approxi-
mately 100 miles to “practice.”

‘ The Panthers had a dual meet at
Clarion, but that was hard to know
if one listened to Pitt coach Fred
Lewis.

‘ ‘We went up there and treated it

* like another practice,” Lewis said. 

“We knew we could beat them.

The spectacular high jumping of
Maryland’s Paula Girvenled to the
breaking of just one of the many
broken meet records at the third
annual Pitt women’s invitational
track meet last weekend. Girven, a

changes, defeated. the Golden

To win its seventeenth consecu-
tive dual meet, Pitt ﬁnished both
ﬁrst and second in nearly every
event, something it has. done
several times this season.

Lewis said he was better able to

Some of the hostess Pantherettes
were pretty impressive themselves.
Pitt freshman Peri Jude Radecic
captured the shot put competition
with a throw of 48-3, more thanone

competitor. In the process, Radecic
broke the meet record and also her

lineup. Clarion is one of the
weakest teams on Pitt’s schedule.

“Many ‘of our kids swam in
different events, which was good
because I don’t like to see them get
in a rut and swim in’) the same
events all the time,” Lewis said.»

Swimming out of position did not
hurt Panthers Jeff Trew, Stu
Swanson or Dale Pﬂaumerl Each
placed at least second in their new
events.

Trew, who usually swims isn the
distance events, won the 200-yard

although he never had competed in
that event as a Collegian. I

forward to the Eastern regional

championships next month where
the Pantherettes hope to capture
the title:

“The swimmers that can qualify
for Easterns have already‘ done
so,” said Bradshaw. “We will go

Bradshaw also said he-hopes to

Cold Pantherettes Wann
To Eastem Michigan

By ANNA ARLOTTAV
Pitt News Staff Writer

, Pitt’s ,women’s basketball team
“showed signs of improvement”
according to coach Jean Balthaser,
after it handed Eastern Michigan a
73-59 defeat Saturday night.

With four Pantherettes in serious
foul trouble throughout the second
half Balthaser looked to the bench
for help and received it.

The game started out slowly.
Three fouls by Pitt starting center
Wanda Randolph forced her to the
bench before the end of the ﬁrst
half, when -the Panthers trailed by
ﬁve.

Sophomore guard Debra Murray
sparked Pitt by scoring 12 of her 14
points in the second half. ‘

“Debbie gave us the ﬁre we
needed outside when we needed it
the most. She was a little tense in
the first half,” said Balthaser “But
she looked just great in the secon
half.” . V A

Murray came into the game with
the Pantherettes down 32-27 and’
scored three straighfbaskets. Pitt
began to take complete control of

with herfi’

u

the game.‘ The Pantherettes scorediih

12 unanswered points to take an
eight point lead that they never
lost. Senior Stephanie Stripling"
scored seven of these points. ‘

Balthaser. praised Pantherette,
Kathy Paczkowski. Paczkowski
scored 12 points, eight of which
were scored consecutively to boost
Pitt to a 63-51 lead.

 “Against Eastern Michigan Ka-
thy‘ really showed what she is
worth. She has had a rough
strilggle since her return from an
injury,” said Balthaser “The
second half was the best of any
game she has had all year. She did
a real good job.” 3

The win over Eastern Michigan
was billed as a conﬁdence builder

for the Pantherettes because their ‘

remaining games are important

regional contests.
