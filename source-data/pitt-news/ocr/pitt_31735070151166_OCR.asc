Dante Taylor, who slammedit
down asthe ﬁnal seconds of over-
time ticked off. "

' That moment, which sealed a
dramatic 73-64 victory over Vil-
lanova on Sunday, was a ﬁtting
way for the two seniors to go out
in their ﬁnal game at the Peter-.
son Events Center after receiving

recognition before tipoff as well i

for their achievements in the Pitt

‘ men’s basketball program.

“It was the best way to end it,”
Taylor said as he began to cry after
the game. “To go out like that, it
was just...grea .”

The senior forward let the
tears fall fromhis eyes while-he
praised each of his teammates
for their individualiperformance.
Woodall, who recorded his ﬁr_st
double—double of the season with
13 points and 11 assists, also felt
that his team really stepped up‘ in
Pitt’s ﬁnal home game as a member
of the Big East. “

“Once the game got going, our
team played for us,” Woodall said.

' Taylor and Woodall would not
have won their ﬁnal home game if
not for the efforts of their team-
mates. ) «

Mayor ends
re— election C
campaign

Trimble and Pat McAteer

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, just 11,,
days after officially announcing his
bid for re—election, said on Friday
that the rigors of the mayoralty
have come at a personal cost to
himself and his family, although
he didn’t divulge what that meant.

“The grueling demands of this
ofﬁce are difﬁcult to describe,” Ra-
venstahl, 33, told reporters and
staff members at City Hall on Fri-
day morning. “After a careful and
considerable amount of thought,
I have decided that that priceihas
become too great to endure. As
a result, I’m dropping my bid’: for
re-election. I do so without any
reservation and with a clear mind.”

Quietly standing alongside him
at the press conference were his
mother, Cindy Ravenstahl, and
father, Judge Robert Ravenstahl.
Mentioning the pressure that
weighed on him while in office,
he spoke with conﬁdence Friday, as
if his decision provided him with
comfort going forward as he ﬁn-
ishes out the remaining 10 months
of his term. ' '

He denied that the current in-
vestigation of the Pittsburgh Police
Department was the main motive
behind his decision to drop out of
the mayoral race, adding that he
hasn’t spoken with federal inves-

' tigators about the investigation

last week.

ment is currently efnbroiled in an

Pitt’s new spot in the Atlantic Coast
Conference aifects more than the
University’s athletic rankings.

Student Government Board mem-
bers will join students from other
universities in the ACC — the NCAA
conference Pitt will join at the conclu-
sion of this school year — on Monday,
March 4, foratwo—day lobbying con-
ference at the nation’s capital.

Much like Pitt Day in Harrisburg,
ACC Day brings higher education lob-
bying to the federal level. Students

from all universities in the ACC can .

meet with federal representatives
to talk about their Pitt experiences
and concerns regarding funding for
higher education.

The ACC’s member institutions
include Duke University, University
of North Carolina, Clemson Univer-
sity, Wake Forest University, Florida
State University, University of Miami,
VirginiaTech, University ofvirginia,

North Carolina State, Georgia Tech
and Boston College as well as Pitt and
fellow incoming member Syracuse
University. -

Board members Sowmya Sana-
pala, C] Bonge andjohn Cordier will
attend the event. Governmental Re-
lations Chair Robert Beecher was
previously scheduled to join them
on the trip to D.C. but had to opt out

because of scheduling conflicts. In S

his place, Fundraising and Adver-
tising Chair Erin Worbs will attend
the event, Board President Gordon
Louderback said.

According to Louderback, the
event, though inclusive of universities
in the same athletic conference, has
little to do with athletics. The com-
mon tie among all students partici-
pating in ACC Day is their attendance
of universities  the same'confer-
ence,‘but- largely, the event will be a
gathering of students from universi-

ties that are academically competitive .

and comparable, Louderback said.

Cordier added to Louderback’s

nizes that athletics aren’_teyerythir_ig.”
The ACC hosts avariety of confer-
ences throughout the ‘year to bring
students of the universities within.it
together. ACC Dayin  will focus
on lobbying for higher ‘education.
Later in the year, Cordiergvvill attend
a conference about atl1let.ics as a rep-
resentative for the Student Athlete
Advisory Committee and Sanapala
willattend ACC Meeting of the Minds,
a conference thatfocuses on research.
“We definitely have a large force
within the region, so to be in a con-'
versation with other schools likeus is
very important,” Cordier said. A
g Pitt has a lot in common in the.
way of the universities of the ACC
because it is a large public institu-
tion dedicatedto resea1?ch'and‘the
business and economic development
of its community, according  Cor-

The Board members’ goal at ACC
Day is to advocate for higher educa-

tion at a federal level and bring back

information thatwill conveythe way
nationally elected officials perceive
Pitt, Louderback said. Liaisons from

Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahi announced Friday he’s ending-his re-eiection cam-

paign. Bobby Mizia |Assistant Visual Editor

FBI investigation regarding whether police
deposited money into and withdrew money
from unauthorized accounts. Two weeks
ago, Ravenstahl’s former bodyguard accused

the mayor of involvement in the accounts, ,

according to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Ravenstahl immediately denied the accu-

sation. ‘
“Many will speculate about my motives

and conclude that the investigation is my

reason for today,” Ravenstahl said. “It’s not.
I’ve done nothing wrong.-That will be proven
over time.” . .
Additionally, he defended the Pittsburgh
Police Department, saying that he didn’t
consider it a “dysfunctional system’’ and
that his staff will release records to the
media clearing him and his office of any
wrongdoing. ' '

‘Political ascension
Ravenstahl entered Pittsburgh politics

in January 2004 when he was sworn into
Pittsburgh City Council to replace incumbent

P «Councilwoman Barbara Burns and represent
District 1. At only 23 years old, he made city - A

history as the youngest city councilman.
“Ten years ago this month I began the

journey that has ledme to where I stand  ._

March 4, 20t 3 I The Pitt News I v\/v\AA/,ptttrtevvs.c0m

today,” Ravenstahl reﬂected Friday. “I was
an ambitious and energized 23-year-old,
determined to make his neighborhood and

city better.” .

Shortly thereafter, in December 2005,
Ravenstahl claimed another historic title as
the youngest president of the City Council.
He was chosen as the compromise candi-
date, following the inability ofjim Motnzik
— the favored candidate —— to secure ﬁve
votes to clinch the position.

This was not his last ascension on the
city political ladder or “youngest” title.
Following former Mayor Bob O’Conner’s
sudden deterioration in health and death
from a rare brain cancer, Ravenstahl, then
only 26, became the youngest mayor of a
‘major American city. This role was fulﬁlled
following the protocol outlined in the city’s
charter. He then won a special election in
2007 and the regular election in 2009 to

e fulﬁll the regular four-year term.

‘N Much of Ravenstahl’s tenure in the of-
ﬁce centered around his ambitious goals to
improve the city and also his youthﬁil ways,
which he never fully restrained. '
He ﬂew -to New York with a Penguins
owner, took a cityisecurity‘SUV_eto a?-Toby.

The media criticized him for his behavior,
but on Friday, he didn’t want to dwell on that.
He hopes that people will remember him for
what he was able to achieve in his tenure.

State of the mayoral race

The question that remains is whether a
new candidate will enter the mayoral race
against City Controller Michael Lamb and
City Councilman Bill Peduto. Before his an-
nouncement Friday, Ravenstahl was con-
sidered the front—runner in theelection.
He raised $909,695 as of Feb. 1 —- about
$400,000 more than Peduto and Lamb
combined. Ravenstahl will consult with his
campaign contributors to decide how the
funds,,he had collected for his campaign so
far should be used.

KAISER

Girls’ bathroom graffiti is occasionally crass
and wrought with penis pictures, but it seems to
be in the minority at Pitt. The graffiti I’ve seen at

Pitt seems to divide itselfinto three categories: _

advice, quotes and pictures.
One stall in the Union seems to be the hot
spot for advice grafliti and also seems to be

painted over the most. That’s understandable. .

Some shy bladders wouldn’t feel comfortable
peeing in a stall covered in sex tips, but I think
there’s potential here. _

Why not turn a stall into a Pitt advice forum?
You could share advice, including where not to

go to party or where there’s a sale on chocolate '

and, yes, sex advice. If it gets too inappropriate,

slap on a couple coats of paint and begin again.
Bathrooms are our friends. They help us
touch up our makeup, hide from unwanted ac-
quaintances and bond with friends (remem-
ber Newton’s 10th law: Girls can’t pee alone).
They’re there for us through tears and vomit,
through failed tests and botched labs. And just
like good friends, they try to brighten our not-
so—awesome days with uplifting quotes. '
I’ve seen quotes ranging from “You’re beau-
tiful” and “Smile!” to “A prayer for the wild at:
heart kept in cages’ ’ (Tennessee Williams) and,

“So-webeaton, boats against the current, borne -

backceaselessly into the past” (“The Great
Gatsby”), which ends up being uplifting simply
because it’s poetic. . , :

It’s like an old—school Tumblr: People write
quotes and draw pictures they love‘,1and» then
other people connect-_with them-and respond.

The notorious Harry Potter stall on the third
ﬂoor in the Cathedral best demonstrates this.
It’s literally covered in quotes —— none of which
are repeats ‘— and an insanely detailed draw-
ing. of Harry. Besides the Cathedral against a
blue sky, I’m pretty sure this stall is the most
Snapchatted scene at Pitt.

-1 don’t think every girl’s stall ‘should be .

converted by the school into a legal wall, but I
thinkwe should designate several as acceptable

. doodling surfaces. I recommend the Cathedral

since that’s where most of the cool graffiti is
anyway, and you get alot of foot traffic through
thoseibathrooms, meaning more people can
see your work. I ‘

You might argue that aesthetics and creativ- ‘

ity in a bathroom are pointless _— all that one

should: care about islthat theseat is clean, and V

there’s.toilet paper left. But people with TVs

andmagazine racks in their bathrooms make
me think people are spending a lot more time
in there than we think.

I’m not saying we should rearrange the toi-
lets to increase the feng shui or install crown
molding, but} think a new creative outlet would
be a nice touch.

You might also argue that allowing a des-
ignated grafﬁti area is one small step in a bad
direction  the notionthat people will start
drawing  on othlelrstuff and soon all the
girls’ bathrooms will be covered in tags and

penis drawings,  forgetting  this ,
is Pittand most pejo'fpIe‘3accessing these bath-' . .»

If most of our  _,__consists of Harry
Potter. drawings- and Te‘ fess'ee Williams quotes,

_ I’d saywe’re headed in apoéiﬁve direction. I

Pitt suffers another defeat in last home game

The Panthers fail for their 351:h—consecutive Big East game, losing to DePaul on Saturday. Sarah Kontos | Senior StafflPhotographer

Tyler Pecyna -
Stqﬁ” Wrz'ter

A well—oiled machine performed in full force
Saturday afternoon at the Petersen. Events

. Center. The women played in unison, mak-

ing the perfect leaps at the proper times,
and the crowd responded with positive‘
accordance. 7 .
Then the halftime show. ended, and the
youth jump-rope team thatwowed those in
attendance skipped off the court and made
way for a Pitt team on its way to. an 81-7
loss to DePaul.’ , 6
The defeat secured a second—consec_utive

cl winless Big East regular season at home and
a 35th—straight non—tournament conference

loss overall for the Panthers.
’ Pitt (9-19, 0-15 Big East) mounted a late

comeback in the ﬁnal two minutes of the!

game, but DePaul (20-9, 9-6 Big East) halted
momentum by answering nearly every Pan-

ther basket and by sinking its free throws. .

With about two minutes remaining and

the Panthers trailing by 12, sophomore.

guard Brianna Kiesel caught ﬁre, scoring
eight points in the‘ next 1:09 — ‘ac stretch

highlighted by an alley-oop that she finished
witha lay-in while drawing a foul. .

After the game, Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato praised the sophomore guard’s
efforts.

“I thought Bri really attacked today,”
Berenato said of Kiesel. “At one point, I
thought she was being passive, and she was
trying to be unselﬁsh like shealways is and
pass the ballto everyone else.”

Berenato said she encouraged Kiesel to
be more aggressive-  ' .

The stat line indicates that Kiesel, who
ﬁnished with a career-high 28 points, took
the advice. ._ A ',

Despite —Kiesel’s torrent play, which

brought Pitt back to within four late in the -

game,-the Blue Demons held on, largely
thanks to their 50'-percent shooting success
in the second half.

'“It is quite frustrating,” Pitt-’s Asia Logan
said, regarding DePaul’s ability to answer
Pitt’s outburst of offense. “But boxing out,
the little things we need to [improve] — we
have to keep working.” . V .  ' ' _ ’ .

Logan was working. The junior forward
notched her eighth double-doubleion the

season, ﬁnishing with 16 points and 1; '

bounds. .
Yet, as Logan mentioned, the rebound-

ing was not enough to match DePaul. Se-

nior forward Katherine Harry collected

'18 rebounds, and sophomore guard’Brit-

tany Hrynko added eight of her own for
the visitors. -

The Blue Demons’ advantage on the
glass allowed them to get out ahead of the
Panthers in transition. DePaul’s quickness
resembled that of the jump ropes whipping

in a circular motion around the youth team '

at halftime. That quickness gave the visiting
team a 17-6 edge infast—break points and
prevented Pitt from ever holding a lead in
the contest. _ ’

“We thought it was going to be a close
game. We knew we just needed to do things
like box out and step up thetransitions,”
Kiesel said. “We kind of got lost in our tran-

sition points.” The Panthers were off their-

game plan, she added.

The Panthers have one ﬁnal regular-
season game remaining to adjust their off-
beat step and end their lengthy conference

losing streak. Pitt travels to Rutgers to face .

the Scarlet Knights on Monday night at

' 7:30 p.m. I

ROGER THAT

Pitt fans should
remember

Taylor, Woodall

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The sold—out Petersen Events Center rose to
salute one tall underachiever and one shorter
overachiever. _

To the 12,553 fans who attended the Pitt
men’s basketball team’s Senior Day game against
Villanova on Sunday afternoon, it didn’t matter
that forward Dante Taylor never lived up to the

2-

"~4-

hype that surrounded the former McDonald’s *1

High School All-American or that guard Tray
Woodall excelled in the same recruiting class that

A includedthemorehighlytoutedNasirRobinson

and Ashton Gibbs.

The effort mattered. The character mattered.
The memories mattered. The impact the two
seniors had on the program mattered.

After the emotional opening ceremony, both
Taylor and Woodall, with the help of the rest of
the Panthers, stood tall and gave the Pitt fans
one more memorable moment in a thrilling,
dramatic, nerve—racking and heart-pounding

73-64 overtime victory over cross—state rival ”‘

Villanova.

The Panthers (23—7, 11-6 Big East) needed
three 3—pointers by redshirt freshman Durand
Johnson to stay close, a late 3-pointer by fresh-
manjames Robinson to tie the. game and an
incredible overtime period from redshirt junior
Talib Zarma to secure the victory.

But it was the two seniors who ﬁnished the
contest of in storybook fashion, with Woodall
passing to Taylor for an emphatic dunk that
ended the scoring with less than.1O seconds
remaining in overtime. Taylor looked to the
heavens and let out a yell in his lrademark fash-

ion, while Woodall smiled and pointed at his l

fellow senior and long—time roommate.

Then Pitt head coachjamie Dixon substituted
both, giving the crowd one last opportunity to
bid farewell to the dynamic duo.

“That was the best way to end it,” Taylor

said of the game’s ﬁnal sequences. “To go out

like that, it’s just...great.”

The emotions of the exhilarating game car-
ried over into the post—game press conference.

Taylor struggled to answer questions, paus-
ing to sob atvarious increments. Woodall suc-
ceeded in ﬁghting back the tears, but his red
eyes showed histrue feelings.

And on a day Pitt men’s basketball fans will
treasure for some time, even coach Dixon ap-
peared to be a man who could begin crying un-
controllably at any moment.

It was chilling. To see grown, usually com-
posed men show just how much Pitt, their team-

moment to think of the perfect words to do

justice to Taylor and Woodall, “we’re proud to .

 e received plenty of help from Robinson,
Zanna and the rest of their teammates Sunday.
f , Robinson,  to several clutch 3-point-
ers andfree throws, ﬁnished with14points. Zan-
na tallied nine of his 14 points in the overtime
period and recorded a game-high 19 boards to
solidify the Panthers’ rebounding game despite
the absence of freshman center Steven Adams,
who was out with an ankle injury.

Woodall, who recorded 13 points and 11 as-
sists in his ﬁnal game at the Pete, also played
well, but he happily’acknow1edged thatsome of
histeammates carried the Panthers. to victory.

>_“I was great to?-see haveia great cover-

   

    

time,” Woodall said of Zanna. “He works ex-
tremely hard, and it’s a great feeling for him to
play this well.”

On a day revolving around the seniors, Pitt
produced a team effort of the highest order to
record a crucial conference win that will keep
the team’s hopes of earning a top—four seed and

. a double bye at the Big East tournament next

week alive. .
If the Panthers can maintain the level of

intensity they demonstrated Sunday, then a V

lengthy run through either the Big East tour-

nament or even the NCAA tournament isn’t

beyond them.

“We ain’t done y ” Taylor said, emphasizing
that even though beatingvillanova was memo-
rable, he wants to create even better memories
later this March.

Regardless of what happens in the next few
weeks of postseason basketball, Pitt fans won’t
forget Dante Taylor and Tray Woodall any time
