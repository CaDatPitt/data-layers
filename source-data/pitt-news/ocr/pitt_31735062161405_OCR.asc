lDuquesne Magi‘

Gets Banned

Duquesne University oﬂicials
have banned the campus humor
magazine, Duquesne. The surprise
action was announced on Wednes-
day.

The edict followed publication
of the March issue of the maga-
zine in which comment was print-
ed concerning the parking ‘situ-
ation on the “Bluff.”

The statements implied that the
University administration wasn’t
doing all it could to remedy the
situation.

Although the University has
issued no ofﬁcial statement as to
-‘their reasons for banning the
magazine, Duquesne’s Dean’ of
Men Rev. James F. MacNamara
said the publication has missed
deadlines, their material is medi-
ocre, and that things were brought
to a head by the parking editorial.

Last year the magazine won
’All-American honors in the Na-
tional Scholastic Press Association
annual awards to collegiate pub-
lications. This is the highest
award a college magazine can re-
ceive.

Wednesday.

All students will vote then with the exception of juniors
and seniors in the School of Pharmacy who are to cast their

ballots Tuesday.
At NEWS deadline time

the situation looked like this:

Whatever candidates are named¢

on the IF Slate Sunday will prob-
ably be elected to office.

So far no other parties have
formed to contest the supremacy
of the fraternity slate.

Since IF Council meets only
three days before elections, the
time element will hardly permit
candidates who do not make the
slate to whip together opposition
tickets.

However, at least one fraternity
man has declared in advance that
he will not accept IF backing in
the elections. He is Sam Shapiro
I member of Phi Epsilon Pi fra-

ternity, who told the NEWS Wed-
nesday that he will run by himself
since he feels the “IF Slate is un-
healthy for the University.

The junior candidate for Stu-
dent Congress has adopted as a
slogan for~his one-man campaign,
“Merit is the key word.”

Shapiro, past president of the
Varsity Lettermen’s Club and a
baseball letterman, says’ he will
join forces if possible with some
of the men who miss the frater-
nity slate.

5. Instructed its Loyalty Oath
Committe: to. speak for the chap-
ter on the issue and disseminate
its views.

Over 150 faculty signatures
to the AAUP letter requesting
public hearings on Senat Bill
27 had been received at noon
yesterday, and Chapter Secre-
tary William S. Tacey reported
that ‘we; expect many more’
by the end of the week.

The meeting, minutes of which
were released to the Pitt News
today, was the ﬁrst held since
the State Senate passed the bill
March 28, but the Oath Commit-
tee, augmented by other profes-
sors, has been actively engaged in
rallying support against the bill.

In Danger of Passing

Dr_ Herman Epstein, professor
of biophysics, told the group
Tuesday that it was the opinion

' of a state representative with

whom he conferred that the bill
should be killed in committee, as
it is “rather sure of passing if it
should reach the ﬂoor of the
House.”

The same representative re-
ported that ‘strong opposition’ has
been felt from all parts of the
state. He suggested that individ-
uals should express opposition to
the bill at once by writing to
Representative Ivan Watkins,
chairman of the Legislative Com-
mittee of the House, stating the
reasons for opposition and re-
questing a hearing.

Penn State Concerned

A letter -from the head of Penn
State’s Faculty Council reported
that the AAUP chapter there is
equally concerned. The letter stat-
ed that “the overwhelming majori-
ty of professional educators at
Penn State disapproved the bill.”

Dr. Charles Taintor, professor
of law who was appointed as the
chapter's legislative representative

to Harrisburg, should hearings be

Local Educators Join

AAUP to Halt Bill

By DICK KOVAR
Editor
While consideration of a state income tax bill temporari-
ly stalled the proposed ‘loyalty oath’. bill in a House com-
mittee, opponents of the oath at the University gathered sup-
port from all areas of the school this week in an effort to
further delay the passage of the bill.

"The ‘latest action came from the Pitt chapter of the
American Association of University Professors, which, at a
meeting in the Faculty Club Tuesday:

1. Endorsed the national association’s resolution con-
demning loyalty oaths in general; , 
2. Prepared to send a letter (signed by a large number
of the faculty) stating the main objections to the oath and
requesting hearings on it to the chairman of the House

Legislative Commitee, where the bill is currently held.

3. Sent copies of the "protest and the endorsement to all
Pennsylvania AAUP chapters;

4. Elected a legislative representative to attend the public

held, expressed the legal opinion. 

that the bill is probably uncon-
stitutional and/or unenforceable.
Opponents of the bill should not
rely on that probability, how-
ever, but should strongly oppose
the bill immediately, he warned.‘

The chapter then authorized its
expanded loyalty oath ‘committee
to speak for the entire group on
the issue, directing them to in-
dicate by public statements the
distinction between “simple oaths
of loyalty and speciﬁc oaths,”
such as the one proposed.

Mass Meeting Tomorrow

Meanwhile, the Student Organi-
zation of Pitt’s School of Social
Work called a mass meeting to-
morrow of all students in that
school to discuss the oath ques-
tion, with the aim of formulating
a speciﬁc statement of policy and
perhaps take direct action.

This, together with a resolution
by Student Congress condemning
loyalty oaths in general, as well
as the circulation of a letter
among the student body request-
ing hearings, brought all three
areas of the University into the
ﬁght to bring about public dis-
cussion of the oath issue.

Previously, Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald, seconded unani-
mously by the Board of Deans,
had sent a letter to Harrisburg.
requesting ‘extended hearings’ on
the bill. '

SociaTWbrkers
To Discuss Oath

The entire student body of the
School of Social Work will meet
tomorrow in 3209 C1. at 11
a.m. to discuss the issues con-
cerning the loyalty oath legisla-
tion now in the Pennsylvania
legislature.

Everyone interested in this vital
issue is urged to attend.

Staff Reporter
Application cards are now available to draft-eligible col-
lege, students who wish to take the college qualiﬁcation test

which may lead to draft deferment.
Beginning yesterday, April 12, application cards may be

obtained at any draft board of-
ﬁce up until the dates of the test.
Test dates are May 26, June 16,
and June 30.

These applications are in the
form of a double post card which
the student will ﬁll out, fold in
half, stamp with a one-cent
stamp and send to the Educational
Service, Princeton, N. J., which is
administering the examination at
about 1,000 test centers.

Records At Princeton

At Princeton, one-half of the
card will be kept for a record of
the student’s application. The
other half will be sent back to the
student, notifying him of the date
and place in which he will take
the exam. It will~ also contain
printed permission for entrance
to the place of examination, which
must be presented at the door.

There are three testing centers
in Pittsburgh. The University of

Pittsburgh has the number 933..

The other centers are Carnegie
Tech, No. 931, and Duquesne Uni-
versity, No. 932.

The students must signify on
the application cards the exam
center he would like to take the
test on each of the three test
dates. Although he chooses where
he will take the test, a student
will not know when until he is
notiﬁed by Princeton on the other
half of his application.

Info At Draft Boards

An information sheet, contain-
ing info about the test and the
method of applying for it, is
available at all draft boards along
with the application cards.

Administration of the test here
at Pitt is in the hands of Dr.
George L. Fahey, director of the
University Testing Service. Ac-

cording to him, a tentative ar-

bra ft Test F arms at Board Offices l ;

rangement provides for testing
rooms in the Cathedral. It will be
administered to students by staff
members of the psychology de-
partment.
Booklet Form Test

The test itself consists of a
question booklet and an answer
sheet. According to draft oﬁicials,
each student will be given an
electrographic pencil for mark-
ing the answer sheet. Students

will report at 9 a. m. at their’

testing center to begin the 31/2
hour examination.

According to the American
Council on Education, this exam
is not based on factual informa-
tion but on “ability to learn at
the college level.” .

The “ability to understand ver-
bal relationships,” including ver-
bal. analogies, the “ability to in-
terpret data when presented in
the form of tables, charts, graphs,
or diagrams,” and on “arithmetic
reasoning.” In this third divi-
ion, “the candidate will be ex-
pected to display only quantita-
tive reasoning, not
mathematical knowledge.”

  The Voice of History

EDITOR’S NOTE: The following letter, written by at lecturer

in history, was too long to appear in the Letters to

the Editor

column. We feel it is of such importance. however, that we print

it in slightly abridged form here.)

Editor
Pitt News:

“I like a little rebellion now and then .

. . the spirit-

of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions
that I wish it be always kept alive. It will often be exer-
cised when wrong, but better so than not to be exercised

at all.”

“If the happiness of the mass of the people can be se-g
cured at the expense of a little tempest now and then, orj

eVen,a little blood, it will be a precious purchase.”
The above quotations are all byO~~~

Thomas Jefferson, whose birthday
is annually celebrated by the
Democratic Party in recognition of
the fact that he is the “father” of
that party. V

“This country, with its insti-
tutions, belongs to the people who
inhabit it. Whenever they shall
grow weary of the existing Gov-
ernment, they can exercise their
constitutional right of amending
it or their revolutionary right to
dismember or overthrow it.”

The above quotation is by Abra-
ham Lincoln, whose birthday is
annually celebrated by the Repub-
lican Party in recognition of the
fact that he is the “father” of that
party.

“Subversive Organization means
any organization which engages in
or advocates, abets, advises, or
teaches, or a purpose of which is

Was Jefferson Subversive?

I submit that both the Republican and Democratic parties
could logically be called subversive under this deﬁnition.
Certainly a’ reasonable man could show that the words of
Jefferson and Lincoln might well be interpreted as advocat-
ing, abeting, advising, or teaching the overthrow of the
state or national government by force. It follows that every

state employee who ever registered or voted with either
. .._. ._.._..._

major party is subversive.

It might appear that all the
foregoing is academic; that what-
ever Jefferson and Lincoln may
have said,’ the law is not really
aimed at Republicans and Demo-
crats. That is quite true. And
it is not really aimed at Com-

unists either. Your students
know this. They may complain
about their teachers. They may
find some are uninspired, that
some are inadequately prepared,
that some are timid and ‘dull.
You may hear such complaints
,._ any day, but you won’t hear stu-
‘dents complain that their teach-
ers are subversive. .

None of us think our schools are
perfect. We know there are many
educational problems the legis-
latur_e might well consider, but

Tyhought Control is

It is my personal opinion that a Communist teacher
should not be ﬁred merely because he is a Communist. It
is my opinion that no person should be penalized for the
thoughts. It is my opinion that you cannot ﬁght totalitarian-
ism by adopting the totalitarian doctrine of thought control.

“But when men have realized9 

that time has upset many ﬁghting
faiths, they may come to believe
. . that the ultimate good de-

sired is better reached by free
trade in ideas——that the best test
of truth is the power to the
thought to get itself accepted in
the competition of the market,
and that truth is the only ground
upon which their wishes can be
safely carried.”

That at any rate is the theory
of our Constitution. It is an ex-
periment, as all life is an ex-
periment. Every year if not every
day we have to wager our salva-
tion upon some prophecy based
upon imperfect knowledge. While
that experiment is part of our
system. I think that we should be
eternally vigilant against attempts
to check the expression of opinion
that we loathe and believe to be
fraught with death, unless they
so imminently threaten immediate
interference with the lawful and

pressing purposes of the lawgthat

to take an oath of loyalty . . .”

,show by their insistence on con-

to engage in or advocate, abet.
advise or teach activities intend-
ed to overthrow, destroy or alter,i
or to assist in the overthrow, de-
struction or alteration of the con-
stitutional form of the government
of the United States or of the
Commonwealtl" of Pennsylvania
or of any political subdivision of
either of them by force or vio-
lence, and which has been named
as a subversive organization by
the Attorney General of the Com-
monw- 11th of Pennsylvania.”

The above quotation is from
Senate Bill No. 27, “Requiring
every person in the employ of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
or any political subdivision there-
of, or any employees of state-
aided colleges and schools, other
than elected state or local oﬁicers,

we all know that subversive
teachers is not one-of those prob-
lems_

Among the thousands of te__ach-
ers in Pennsylvania there may
well be a few Communists. But
if there are, they must not open-
ly avow their beliefs or they
would long ago have been ﬁred.

Thus, if there are any, they must
keep their views secret. If the
Communists have the complete
lack of morals, the complete dis-
respect for truth, which their
critics ascribe to them, they will
take the oath without protest.
This argument has frequently
been advanced against \the law,
but, although it is perfectly valid,
I believe it is thortsighted to
stop there.

Totalita.ria,n

an immediate check is required t
save the country.” (Justice
Holmes.)

TLmid men have never been
willing to accept this doctrine.
They fear the “free trade in
ideas.” It is a paradox of our
time 'that the super-Americanists
who loudly proclaim that our
“way of life” is above criticism,

formity, by their efforts to re-
strict freedom to think, to speak,
and to write, that they really
maintain grave doubts that “our
way of life” is strong enough to

stand comparison with other
ways. They want to freeze the
mold.

Freedom. liberty, and democracy
are dynamic concepts; they cannot
merely be maintained, they must
grow-—or die. Even if we were
perfect even if there were no ad-
vances possible in furthering lib-
erty, freedom and democracy, it
would be sheer disaster to try

by silencing all criticism, by sup-
pressing all new ideas, by con-
trolling thought.

One good way to judge Senate
Bill No. 27 is by the way similar
laws have operated in other states
and nations. The law is not go-
ing to uncover many Communists.
It probably isn’t even going to re-
suit in the ﬁring of many liber-
als, nless the Attorney General
allows himself to be dominated by
hysterical super-Americanists.

It likely won’t cause the resig-
nation of many teachers———just a
handful of the best.

The only other result will be
that the remaining good teachers,
the thinkers, the seekers for
truth, will be forced to compromise
in their quest for truth. They
will become timid. They will no
longer follow wherever truth may
lead. And they no longer will be
good teachers.

There may come a day when

students at Pitt can go into 3
class dealing with some phase of
current affairs with perfect as-
surance that not a word will be
said that could possibly offend any
member of the DAR the Ameri-
can Legion, or the NAM. If that
day should come, I hope the Tuck
Shops are crowded. They might
learn something there.

of years ago. A broad statement I realize and I shall tell
0

~ you why I make it.

On Wednesday I, like almost

Jeveryone here who has mastered
the English language, was a little

excited about the Truman—Mac-

«Arthur parting of the ways. I
..breezed into the Cathedral look-
. ing ‘for a friend who. might have

taken poli sci I and so be able to
I didn’t
have any luck so I went to my
class.

if-Placid Beginning

M The period started off placidly
enough. The prof, as is his wont
‘every Monday, Wednesday and

 Friday, bent ox er his lectern and

checked the roll. Occasionally he
glanced up to correlate the vacant

:t seats with the culprits’ names on

his list. The assembled masses,

7 realizing that he was only check-
“ ing the roll, continued to carry on
' a series of disjointed conversa-
, tions.

Then he looked up and stayed
up. All was silent. History 64
was about to roll on its merry

: way into the differences between
the Mensheviks and the Bolshe-
~ viks, and their relationship to the

Slavophiles and the Bunge ﬁnan-
/cial reforms. I

But seated somewhere in that
vast room, in either row four or
ﬁve, there was a mind that
soul

needed ‘fanned in the heat of

_ academic free speech. He spoke

up. .
V What About MacA‘rthur

“What do you think of the Mac-

Arthur situation?” he asked. The
prof, whose smile betrayed that
he had expected the- query, re-
plied’. And after that the ques-
tions and the answers ﬂew_ thick
and fast. , I

We sifted and sorted a medley
of opinions on the topic. There
were those who felt that Truman
had betrayed” the nation to‘ the
evil menace of an avaricious
Britain and that we had given
into the rest of the greedy Euro-
peans whose only aim is to suck
us dry. I

At one point the discussion be-
came overly scholarly and one of
our budding historians brought it
back to terrestial dimensions with
a bit of wit. He recounted, a joke
which I will insert for the record
only because I thought it was par-
ticularly pertinent and because I
chuckled. ,

‘It seems that one day last year
a psychiatrist ‘made an appearance
at the gates of St. Peter up above.
St. Peter asked him what he was
about. The psychiatrist, a gradu-
ate of the University of Pitts-
burgh, told him that he was up
to see HIM.

St. Peter, as you might guess,
was a little disconcerted “What is
wrong with HIM?” he asked the
Pitt Grad.

“HE is beginning to act like
MacArthur,” he replied. I pass
on. .
Some: of the students felt that
we were underestimating the im-
portance of Asia in the overall

Everyone Happy

But there seemedto be a pre-
vailing feeling of relief about the
whole thing. Almost every time
either Mac’s«or Harry’s name was
mentioned there were sparodic
bursts of laughter. When one of
the students exhibited a down-
town paper that, carried the can-
ning in red heladlines, everyone
laughed. .

"After about thirty-ﬁve minutes
on the intricacies of present day,
high level,‘top secret diplomacy,
an amazing thing happened. The
prof, before anyone knew, what
had happened, was lecturing on
Russian history. Some unthink-
ing person had asked him a ques-
tion that led right into the sub-
ject, Russo-American relations.
This, of course, is a violation of ‘
the student code.

We spent the rest of the
period on Russian History.
But I can’t help think that we
were on the subject all along.
For the ﬁrst time we were
able to relate the type in the
textbooks to the ﬁghting in __-_—- ,, 1.,

Lost: A Sense of Humor

A:

’ Clark Sutton  

I mourn the fact that the University of Pittsburgh has
lost its sense of humor. The joint has gone stark raving mad.
Take this loyalty oath business. Honestly, I nearly died

laughing when I heard about it. Got the hiccups for three
days and had to go to the doctor¢

Six Minus Tliree     ’

The Pitt student who ﬁnds himself intimately concerned

9 with the happenings in Harrisburg and on the Washington-

Tokyo circuit, should not lose sight of politics on his home

; grounds, here on campus.

This is especially important when a group of students

‘are taking advantage of existing rules and seem to be on

their way to making a farce of student government. Such

t is the case with the recent internal elections held by Men’s

Council, by which six members of this year’s Council were
elected to serve again next year.

The objective behind this measure is to insure exper-

: ienced membership for the coming year. But this purpose

.will not be achieved.
Of the six elected. one, Ralph Thorne, has already an-
nounced his intention to resign; and two others——Don Mille-

' tary and Jack Burwinkle—have ﬁled petitions and been

nominated for Student Congress. If they are elected, they
will have to resign from Council as a student cannot belong
to both organizations.

In other words although six of the .14 underclass mem-

. bers of Council were elected to serve again, there "will very

likely be only three on next year’s Council.

A student should have the right to choose whatever
organization he wished to join, but he should choose! If
these three s'tudents were not interested in another year’s
tenure in Council, that should have been made clear before
the, internal elections. Then,’ after they accepted the elec-
tion they should not have ﬁled petitions for Congress nom-
inations. (Petitions were ﬁled one‘ week after the internal
election.) .

This way, the two who are running for Congress can’t
lose. If they don’t get elected to Congress, they can still stay
in Council. If they do get elected toiCongre.ss (the more
desirable of the two positions according to the politico’s way
of thinking) they can simply resign from Council.

The principle of experienced leadership, however, is
somewhat lost in the shuflle. A ﬁnal reprimand is still, for-
tunately, in the hands of the student voters.

to get cured.

But around here, all you get is
nothing but frantic breast beating
and low moaning about the end
to the constitutional right of aca-
demic freedom. To which I say
. . hooey. Frankly, I haven’t
said whether the loyalty poath
\they’ve been screaming about is
good, bad or indifferent. I oppose
it because it can’t possibly work.
Money At Stake-’

I oppose this oath because I
am in no position to pay any
more money to the state in the
form of taxes. If every teacher
and state employee signs it, wheth-
er they are' communists or not, we
will have a state capitol jammed

to the ceilings with papers which
won’t mean a thing. Then some
wise senator will decide we need
a_million dollars worth of IBM
machines and 12,000 clerks to run
them, and when all is said and
done, we will not have any idea
who is a Communist or who isn’t.

The biggest objection of the
opponents of this oath is that the
Commies will sign it and the loyal
Americans, fearful, of by so do-
ing they. will be losing their aca-
demic freedom will not. That
means the Communists will be re-
tained as instructors and those
who refused to sign will end up
on the streets.

Therefore, I suggest we wait

until all the oaths are signed or
returned sans signature and then
ﬁre all those who did sign it.
They are obviously communists.

' As far as that money situation 

is concerned, why don’t we save
it and turn it over to the schools

so they can hire competent, in-, N

telligent, and (thus) non-com-,
munist teachers so that everybody
will beneﬁt.

Thepoint is, the oath, no 'mat- .-

ter which way you look a_t it,
will not work. Unable to prove
anything, it will not" necessarily,
be the instrument, which wiﬂ
strangle free education. Unless,
that is, the professional pessime
ists continue to take it seriously:
and refuse to laugh at it. The
oath is probably the most ridicu-
lous law ever dreamed up—so let’é
laugh it right into its grave.

Editor
Pitt News

The sudden and violent squawks
against the draft-deferment system
recently approved by the Presi-
dent are picturing college men as
rich, lazy draft—dodgers.

This warped and unfair picture
neglects several points. First is,
as the Pitt News recently point-
ed out men are deferred only, not
exempted from service.

Second is that college men did
not start these deferment plans;
they were set up by manpower
experts who back their beliefs
with facts, that we need a con-
tinual flow of college-trained men
for military and civilian life to
keep our complicated nation op-
erating-

Third is that we are sure Pitt
men would not object to having
federal scholarships granted to
able students who can’t afford to
go to college.

Pitt has mighty few men who
don’t pay at least part of their
own way through school by work-
ing outside, and many who would
be delighted for a chance to quali-
fy for federal scholarships. '

Fourth is that students are not
the only persons being deferred.
Men whose only contribution to
the military effort is that they are

2’

married are deferred large
numbers. Occupational defer-
ments are being given men who
have served apprenticeships in
trades where you don’t pay but
are paid to learn.

Fifth is that hard-working fam-
ilies and students who scrimp to
put themselves through school are
saving the federal government lots
of money by paying for their own
school costs and living expenses,
with an almost sure prospect fac-
ing them of military service when
they are through school; whereas
the men in the armed services
now, many of whom are not in
Korea, will probably have a GI
bill waiting for them when they
come back and want to go to
school.

The way things look now, nearly
all the boys now in college will
have their chance at the- armed
services, and things ‘don’t look to
be any easier then for soldiers,
sailors and airmen than they are

in

-now. And the men now in col-

lege will be men who then know
how to learn and how to use their
noggins.

These two traits may even up
the unbalance between the mil-
lions the Red nations can throw
into the ﬁeld, and the-hundreds
of thousands we can put in to
meet them.

We can’t outnumber ’em; bayon-
et to bayonet they’d take us,
hands down. We have to outthink
and outknow ’em.

It’s great to be a winner.

Joe Scalzo, second baseman for Pitt’s

it feels to be one and hopes the sting of the
winning bug sticks with him during the mitt
season. ’ .

Presently, Scalzo is competing against
Dave Devey for the regular keystone DOSWOD
having won the ﬁrst-round battle by earning a
starting berth against Ohio University last week-
end.

The 19-year old, l70—pound sophomore is a pro-

I by a series of successes. He played shortstop with
, Oakmont last year as the Tri-County league entry
x won the championship. Joe was offered a contract
to play in the Cleveland Indians’ chain that year
but refused, at least for the present.

“Of the three sports baseball’s been my favorite,”
Joe insists, “ever since I began playing the game.”
In fact, Scalzo came to Pitt on a football scholar-
ship but quit the game for his first love.

“I made my own decision to quit football for
baseball,” Joe continued, “and no pressure WES

applied from any corner.”

Panther Gridders Caught in Drafts

JOE SCALZO
Baseball First Love

A draft of some sort is going to play a mighty important
part in the futures of gridders Ted Geremsky and Nick

Bolkovac. ' /

Geremsky has only one draft on
his mind. The Panther end, an ex-
GI, only needs to worry about
cracking the roster of the Detroit
Lions—the professional football
team that drafted him last Decem-
ber.

On the other hand, Bolkovac’s
draft problem is a little more ser-
ious but a little less puzzling.

Pattern Clear

A non—veteran, Nick—the draft
choice of the Washington Red-
skins-——just about knows the pat-
tern of his future.

“I’l1 most likely be in the serv-
ice before next football season,”
the big tackle. says. “There’s one
chance for me, though. If I can
get into the naval reserves, I
might be ‘able to play some pro

As though the Pitt baseball team

single engagement with Kent
State.

The Panthers seek their ﬁrst
win of the season to offset two
previous defeats. Coach Ralph
Mitterling warns, however, “Kent
State is in the same class as Ohio.
They’ll be plenty tough to beat.”

Bob Russell, junior from South
Hills, will pitch for the Panthers.
The righthanded hurler pitched
the opener against Ohio and was
charged with the team’s ﬁrst de-
feat.

Changes in the Pitt lineup shift
Dick Mcshannic to third base and

big help to O’Loughlin. He has
been at Pitt since 1949.

The doctor’s obstetrician work‘

at the hospital has kept him from
devoting as much time to tennis
as he would like, so he will b-e
glad to welcome Ball as an as-
sistant.

Ball is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Texas, where he was
a tennis standout for three years
from 1940 to 1942, prior to his
entry into the Navy.

, Holds Many Titles

He holds quite a few Southwest
tennis titles. He won the South-
west Tennis Association cham-
pionship and the New Mexico
singles title. He also has won the
El Paso singles championship and
several doubles titles with his two
brothers.

Before he came to Pitt, Ball
taught at the University of South-

down by private car.

(See golf preview on Page 6 for,

A random thought.

DOERGE

Did you notice that the Pitt riﬂemen won their section

championship in the National

Riﬂe Associations nationwide

match while the ‘national champion’ Duquesne team ﬁnished

eleventh in their section‘?

Therefore, the inevitable ques—.{
tion pops up again, “How did Du— 1
quesne win the Hearst nationalé
riﬂe championship?” 1

And to quote no one but express
the popular opinion here, “They
did with the pencil.” Or, "They_
ﬁred all their scores from the
prone position.”

Explanation Due

One thing is sure—the Dukes
have some explaining to do.
When a team ﬁres an am-
azingly high score under the
honor system to win a nation-
al title, and then doesn't even
come close to ﬁring a respect-
able score in shoulder-to-
shoulder matches——it’s ' time
to be suspicious.
It is reliably reported that sev-
eral schools are pushing an in-
vestigation of the Hearst tourna-

Inent—~and of Duquesne in par-

When you hear that a scientist works
for a chemical company, it’s natural
to assume he is a chemist. Oddly
enough, the Du Pont Company em-
ploys about as many engineers as
chemists for normal technical work.
Many are chemical engineers. But
when it comes to basic research on
instrumentation—a very important
activity—both chemists and chemi-
cal engineers are in the minority.

This fundamental work is largely
carried out in a laboratory of the
Engineering Department, where elec-
trical engineers, physicists and other
scientists are deeply involved in
electronics studies. They have some
amazing devices to their credit———de-
vices for monitoring industrial opera-
tionscontinuouslyandautomatically.

Some of their ideas are spurred by
a need in an existing plant. But the
design of a new one may also lean
heavily on novel instruments. Take,
for instance, a new Du Pont plant
that uses cyanides. Of course, these
compounds arevery poisonous. So

1942, operates Dielectric Yarn Gage in order
to determine small changes in the denier of

when the plant was being designed,
engineers were aware of the impor-
tance of detecting accidental contam-

the whole question of getting into
production hinged on the problem
of dealing with plant effluents.

slow and inaccurate. So the engineers
developed a “chemical-electronic
watchdog.” Twenty-four hours a
day, it automatically analyzes for
cyanide to one part per million. If an
excessive amount is present, it rings
an alarm bell. Periodically, the ma-
chine pumps cyanide through itself
to be sure it is registering. All the
plant men have to do is take read-
ings occasionally and ﬁll the tanks
with reagents once a week.

Dent School
Gets $3000

The School of Dentistry has re-
ceived $3000 from the United
States Public Health Service.

The grant, which will cover one
year of research, will be used in
the study of non—nutritional fac-
tors that govern tooth form in the
rat. The grant will help deter-
mine to what extent strain char-
acteristics contribute to tooth
form in contrast to the nutritional
factors that are being studied un-
der another grant from the Nu-
trition Foundation.

Dr. Gerald J. Cox, director of
dental research, explained, “We
will carry out this study of strains
of rats by getting them from other
laboratories that have long bred
their own rats. This research will
help determine the limits of what
we can do in controlling tooth
form by nutrition during the
period of tooth development.”
