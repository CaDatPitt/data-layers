Expansion in Research

Research at Pitt is on a rapid
expansion program. “We're going
research!-’ prided Tom Wall, as-
sistant director of personnel. Five
"Ta years ago ‘there was no signiﬁcant

money to support graduate stu-

The grants/totalled two million
dollars and were al1ocated.almost
completely to the School of Medi-
cine and School of Public Health.
This year the grant money has
‘reached ten million one hundred
thousand dollars and is not limited
to the medical center.

_The monies are expected to in-
crease to twelve or thirteen mil-

Only Pitt students and their

of thespring trimester which are
planned for alternate

Suggested apparel for these
dances is sport j-acket and tie.

Other outdoor recreational ac-

be played on the SU lawn by the
Fifth Ave. entrance and on the

'3 The majority of the’ members, ’
of the committee agreed that al-
though many ot the professors
had eased up on ﬁnal tests, the.
student was still at a disadvantage
by having insufficient time to‘
prepare for ﬁnals.
‘ Calendar Proposed

A 50-minute class hour with at
ﬁnals’ week is oneof the proposed
calendars. This program would be"
identical with the current calen—"
dar with the exception that the '
last week of the trimester would '

instructional time. . _ ,
If this plan was put into ‘ef- f -' w
feet, the total amount of class
minutes for each credit would ]
decrease by 50 minutes.’ This is
necessary in order to set aside
time for ﬁnal examinations.

A second trimester alternative,
proposed A is the 60-minute class ,
hour without a ﬁnal examination
week. With this plan, the current
period of instruction would be ex-. \
tended by 10_ minutes per class
hour while retaining the current».
trimester calendar. _ _ _ . ‘

Longer Hours

Lengthening of-the credit hour
is feasible from the standpoint of .
plant and student station use, in

dents, explained that classes.

Mitters Playinigi
  For Themselves,
  Not For Team '

- By TED. COLTON
Sports Editor

 
  

I-IIIIUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII‘

What happened to the Panther baseball team? When the season‘
started, Coach Bobby Lewis had three of his four inﬁelders return-
ing, one outﬁelder, two good pitchers and a hitting catcher who was
put in the fourth spot of the batting order. '

To replace his departed inﬁelder, All-American Shortstop George

- Schoeppner, the Panthers came up with Pete Suder. Although weak

in the ﬁeld, Suder has been the Panthers’ leading hitter and rbi man.
For the outﬁeld Lewis found Mike Ditka, who was supposed to be
quite a stick man, and Corky Cuthbert, a converted inﬁelder. Cuth-
bert is the Panthers’ leading hitting. ' . -

Ralph Shutterly was moved up from the freshman squad where
he pitched real good ball and should have given the Panthers a solid
pitching staff. Now with the Panthers spouting a poor 4-10 record,
we again ask: What is wrong with the mitters?

I guess we can -dwellon the injuries for a while. Second Baseman
Pete Colangelo was lost for the season when he‘ broke his ankle in
the Slippery Rock game early in the season. Suder has been hampered
with a pulled leg muscle and First Baseman Ron Maser missed a
couple of games because of boils on his knee. «

But these injuries can not hold the fullburden of blame for the

,Cats’— bad showing. When Colangelo broke his ankle, Cuthbert~-took

over at second and has done avbetter job than Col'angelo.with, the
bat. Suder and Maser recovered, but the Panthers continue to lose.

Now let’s blame the bad record on the weak hitting. Here we
have" something. Last year's two leading hitters, Nick Kartsonas and
Jerry Matulevic, have not begun to do their job with the bats. Both
are hitting below .200 and have been up to bat time and time again
with men on base. Both failed to deliver. The other players, with
the exceptions of Suder and Cuthbert, have done very little to pick
up this slack. v I

The _pitching has been spotty but no one can expect them to do
their job if the hitters'ar.en’t getting runs.

, ‘Now, I have my own theory -on why the Panthers aren’t winning.
Without a .doubt Lewis has quite a few talented ball players on the
team. And’ indeed no coach ever complained because he had too
-much talent. - ‘

I But it may very well be that this abundance of talent has been
the Panthers’ downfall. Many of the ball players seem to be play-
ing for themselves and are more worried about their battipg aver-
ages than about whether or not the team wins or loses. A little more
team spirit and less “hurrah for me"’a,nd the Panthers might have a
better record. _ 1 -

_ ,3 By MIKE DRAPKIN ,

Bristling winds and strong rains postponed the outcome
of the Eastern Collegiate Golf Tournament for one day, but
an individual champion has ﬁnally been crowned.

He is Don N orbury of‘Penn, who fashioned classy rounds
of 69 and 72 for a 141 total to best the elements and 16 com-
petitors. ’ ~ v

Th e individual championshipé
rounds had been ‘set for match
play Sunday and Monday, but due
to the postponement were held as
36‘ holes of medal play Monday.
The Panthers lone, ﬁnalist, ~
Otis Oliver, shot rounds of 76- I‘
85 for "a 161 total. George Un-
derwood, Panther golf coach,
felt that Oliver did well consid-
ering the circumstances under
which the tournament .w as
played. ' I “ '
Following Norbury in the, scor-
ing were H. Kuntz, Princeton,
74-71, 145; A. Yancy, Army, 76-71,
147; and Mike Phillips, Yale, 78-71,
149.
Army had previously surprised

tal for a 75.4 average for their low

Dual May Decide

Meet Outcome
By JACK SIVIITH .

breezed home with a victory,

thers will ﬁnd their opposition
to be more like a wind as they

travel to meet a steadily im-

proving Penn State team.

Last’ Saturday the Lions lost to
Quanico 74-57, but the score is
not indicative of the’ ﬁne indivi-
dual performances turned in by
State’s performers. In comparison
to the Panther’s recent outputs,
Penn State‘ may‘ get little more
than‘ a workout. '

At Quanico, State’s Bob Brown
beat Ed Collymoree in the 220-
yard ‘dash in 21.5. Speedy Mel

same race on the turn in 21.3.
Brown also won the 100-yard
scamper in 9.7. ‘

Barnwell is the only Panther
who can win the 440. He will
enter this race and leave the 100-
yard dash chores to Jim Donahue
who should place second behind
Brown. '

For only the second time this
year Bill Hinchberger will run
-the half mile. State’s Jim
Schaub has been running this
race around 1:53. Hinchberger
hasn’t run the half that low but
should be able to keep pace with
the swift Schaub.

One of the most surprising Lion
runners is Dick Englebrink. En-
glebrink had a dismal indoor sea-
son and looked-poor this season
outdoors, but last week he ran
the mile in 4:12. “I would have
felt a lot more comfortable if he

duce,” Rees said. A
State’s discus thrower hadn’t
been doing better than 145" until
last week when he threw 160 feet.

Mitters Meet California in Forbes Field.

Biglf Season for Cats S

‘Last week the thinclads‘

-For the third and final‘
timethis season, Panther fol-
lowers will have an oppor-
tunity to see the mitters play
at Forbes Field. They en-
counter California State Col-
lege there tomorrow in a rained-

out-nine. Then they move into
Colgate Fridayfor a single game
and invade the camp of the Syra-
cuse Orangemen on Saturday for
a twinbill.

This is what Coach Bobby
Lewis calls a “Big If Season” for
his Panther diamond nine. If the
Panthers had a little more depth
and if the hitting had been more

been any injuries —- but ifs are
like buts, they cover .a- multitude
of sins. '

Colgate appears to be one of"
the top teams in’the east. and
even Syracuse isn’t ﬂoundering
through a 4-10 season like the
powerless Panthers. Last year
the mitters humbled the Orange-
men 12-2, 7-1, but they also held
an 11-2 recordat this sametime

‘last season.

Most of the Panthers losses
have been by one or two runs.
“It’s all in the way the ball
bounces, Lewis said. “This has
been a disappointing season but
not a discouraging one. We
haven’t b.een getting the breaks.
We have had to work for all our
runs. We c-an still ﬁnish with a.

‘The Immense Journey’ Gives
Artistic Touch to Anthropology

By AR/VID DUERR

“The Immense Journey,” the first collection of essays by
Loren Eisely, author of “Darwin’s Century,” is now in paper-
back form in the Modern Library series for 95 cents.

Dr. Eisely, a well known anthropologist, has taught at a
number of universities. Indeed, in “The Immense Journey,”

we see the writings of a scient

ist in a truly artistic light.

Roads to Life

Forward, through Dr. Eisely’s

vivid imagination, exploring the

many dimensions and _media
through which life mayvhave to
pass and traveling the roads
among the stars whereman. may
have to seek for the ﬁnal secret.

We are warned that, if owe
would pursue such a journey,
this collection of essays is not
a guide book. It is rather “a
somewhat unconventional rec-
ord of the prowlings of one
mind which has sought to ex-
plore_, to understand, and to en-
joy the miracles of this world,
both in and out of science.” Al-
though the scientiﬁc facts pre-
sented in the book are meticu-
lously exact, they are not oh-

This is not a work of fact as is
“Darwin’s Century," rather, an
extension of vision, a projection
of one life into other lives, “the
supreme epitome of the reaching
out.” . 1

Breathed Air

Over three hundred million
years ago a "Shout," a freshwater
Crossopterygian, reached out from
the oily surface of his pond and
breathed the first breath of air;

ing~ changes for all things but
himself.’

The door through which the

“Shout” passed may still be
«there; things may still be pass-
ing through. “We are one of
many appearances of the thing
called Life; we are not its per-
fect image, for it has no image
except Life, and Life is multi-
tudinous and emergent in the
stream of time.”

Skull Found
The recently discovered Boskop
skull from South Africa has a
cranium-to-face ratio which in-
dicates that the Negro race may
have produced “The Man of To-
morrow” thousands of years ago.
Although these Boskop people
were capable of higher mental
development, they were unable
to compete, physically with the

I . other human forms living at the

same. time; and, now, only a
slight trace of their advanced
brain remains in certain variant
individuals among the Bushman
of the Kalahari Desert.

Dr. Eiseley points out that “the
need is not really for more brains,
the need is now fora gentler, a
more tolerant -people,,than those
who won for us against the ice,
the tiger, and the bear.”

(For The Birds)

, The immense journey of Loren
Eiseley is not so immense that it
cannot be imagined by one mind,
nor is it so unique that it cannot
be comprehended by the readers
of his book. -

In some places he is highly
scientiﬁc. in others he makes
statements which would lead
some to question, such as when
he says that the most beautiful
sight in the world may be “the
birds taking over New York
after the last man has run away
to the hills.” ’

The unifying force which holds
these extremes together is time,
which is probably only “a human
illusion, a. subjective clock tick-
ing in our own kind or proto-
plasm."

For the anthropologist, “The
Immense Journey” is a relaxing
one, an enjoyable side trip from
the usual stones and bones and
things; for the general reader, it
is an interesting excursion _into
the realms of science -- past and
future.

morning, or at the same time.
However, because of the 10-min-
ute interval between classes, this
would effect the time of the
lunch-hour period.

Larry Land, sophomore senator,
also added that this effect would
influence such activities’ as Mid-
day Series, and other lunch-time
programs. Swartzbaugh explained
that other arrangements could be
made, if this plan» was put into
effect, so that these activities could
continue.

Exams Wanted

The ﬁnal plan seemed to re-.

ceive the most approval from 'the
members present at the executive
meeting. This plan would consist
of a -60-minute class hour with a
ﬁnal exam week. '

Phil Williams, vice-president
of student body, said that his
only hope is that professors will
use these extra 10-minutes ad-
vantageously, (provided t h i s
particular plan is
rather than merely increase the
work load. ,

“Whatthe faculty will do with
this spare time,” said Swartz-
baugh, “is definitely the main
problem.” He concluded in say-
ing that the effects of not—plan-
ning for a shorter school term
created many problems during the
last two terms.

The semester ‘plan, which was '

used prior to the Fall term 1959,
was weeks in was 14.95 week-s in
length, exclusive of‘ final examina-
tion week.

Some major events for-this and

adopted), “

the coming trimester were dis-
cussed. Isler commented that al-
though Wildwood has been sold,
University major events will be
permitted to be held there for the
next five‘ years. Freshmen orienta-
tian will take place there as prev-
iously.
