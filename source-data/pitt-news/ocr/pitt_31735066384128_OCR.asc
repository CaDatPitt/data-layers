After 300 Years

By KEN GORMLEY
Pitt News Staff Writer

SALEM, Massacbusetts—lt was
during the cold, dreary days of 1692
that the citizens of Salem, a little
village nestled along the shoreline
of Massachusetts, ordered 20
people to swing from the gallowsfor
practicing witchcraft.

Today, almost 300 Halloweens
later, the only witch you can hope
to see is about four feet tall, carries
a shopping bag, and can eat more
Hershey bars than you’re willing to
foot the bill for.

Not exactly. Hop into your car on
some cold, dreary autumn after-
noon, and travel up Route 95 to

 

who rings in the new year on Oct. 31? Witches, that’s who. This coven
from Salen, Massachusetts obviously has no tears despite the fates of its
predecessors 300 years ago.

Salem. Sure, things have changed
in the past three centuries. But not

as much as you might have
hoped...
MISS CABOT AND COMPANY

The second ﬂoor of a_ beer and
oyster house isn’t exactly the kind
of place you’d expect to ﬁnd
witches and warlocks working their
magic. But that’s where Laurie
Cabot and her 12 bleary-eyed
followers meet during October.

‘Miss Cabot, you see, is what you
might call the “head witch” in
Salem. And she looks the part...a
middle-aged woman with coal-

    

black hair. deathly pale skin, a
flowing black gown and a few
golden trinkets dangling from her
neck. *-

Not exactly the kind of girl you'd
want to bring home to meet Mom.

But whether or not you’d like to
meet up with Miss Cabot and
company in a dark alley on
Halloween night, they’re nothing
to have nightmares about.

No. These witches don’t pass
their time turning unsuspecting
people into green-eyed locusts.
They have better things to do
during October...like practicing the
Magic Circle for their annual
Halloween ball.

Tricks and Magic

By PETER J. BUTCH

Pitt News Staff Writer

A medieval ﬁgure in a science

fiction world. That’s how

onbean, a street performing

a ‘magician and juggler, described

himself between performances on

the Cathedral lawn yesterday
afternoon.

Originally from New York,
Moonbean, 25, has been a full-time
street performer for the past year
and a half. He stopped off in

Pittsburgh to earn some gasoline
31033)’ on his way to Washington,

  
   

Moonbean, a traveling street performer en route to Washington, D.C., stop-

“I’ve toured Europe for three of
the past six years,” he said. “lt’s
great there because this sort of
street performance is accepted, it
hasn’t died out.”

While his medieval-style tights
and cloak attracted stares from Pitt
students. Moonbean explained that '
they were accepted in Europe. “I
don’t care if I turn a few heads
here,” he said, “that’s just what
my act needs.”

One of ‘his stage props is an
upside-down derby. At the end of
his routine, he asks those who have

ped at the Cathedral to demonstrate his sleight of hand to curious C|'°Wd$

of Pitt students yesterd.-: .-

enjoyed his act to contribute what
they feel is proper, since this is how
he makes his living. ‘‘I take a
modest approach, and don’t try to

hustle the spectator dollar,” he '

said.

Moonbean noted that on a
campus, all he has to do is place a
hat upside down on the sidewalk to
get contributions. In the city, he
has to pass it among the crowd to
elicit a response.

He estimated he earns $40
performing during an average
lunch hour, though the ﬁgure is
greater on Friday and Saturday
nights and in warm weather. “I’ve
never gone hungry,” he said.

Moonbean studied mime in Paris
and clowning with a Ringling
Brothers’ circus clown. His routine
takes several months of careful
planning and practice.

“The trick is learning how to
catch a crowd,” he said. “When
you perform on the street, you
entertain people on the move-
they’re on their way somewhere. If
you’re not dynamic, they’ll walk
away.”

He recently returned from a tour
of France, Spain, the Netherlands
and North Africa. “In North
Africa, you have people who
haven't seen this sort of sleight of
hand like Westerners have. If you
aren't funny, they’re scared of
you,” he said.

Wednesday, October 26, 1977-THE  l£WS—l;age 7

“Sun, moon and stars to our
witches...” A loud voice cracks the
silence, as Miss Cabot and her
followers glide to the center of the
room to the tune of some slow,
eerie song by the‘Eagles. “Let us
join in the celebration of this new
year.” -

A small, be spectacled witch
named Ginny explains that the idea
behind a Magic Circle is simple.
“Halloween is the witches’ new
year,” she coos.

“It's the time of the year when
all the energy of the earth
polarizes. So we form the Magic
Circle to create a new force of
energy...directing‘ us along the
courses of life we choose.”

The slow pounding music starts
up again, and Miss Cabot’s
followers (about 15 young men and
women; most of them look more
like skeletons than witches) trail
religiously behind their leader.

Once more they form the Circle;
one carries a golden goblet,
another swings a thick, menacing

sword. With -palms pressed to-
gether the witches sway back and
forth while Miss Cabot—as always
——swirls around in the dead center,
brandishing her wand.

“Sure, witches still use wands,”
Ginny says with a sinister grin.

Salem Witches Are Still Hanging In There

“But they don’t have to hide them
in their brooms like in the old days.
Wands are just tools we use to pour
out energy... to heal and work
magic.”

She takes a long, noisy drag of
her thin cigarette, and stares
intensely into space.

“All of us have healing powers.
We have the ability to tune into
someone we’ve never seen before,
tell them what's ailing them, and
cure them by charging their aura
with a particular color.”

By now, the Magic Circle
ceremony is almost over. Miss
Cabot-still in the center—raises
her hands high above her head, as
if getting ready to vanish in a puff
of smoke.

‘‘It’s a frightening thing that so
many people still regard witches as
evil creatures,” ‘Ginny says,
nervously grinding out her ciga-
rette. “Sometimes I’m really
afraid. You never know when some
little town will decide to persecute
witches.”

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN
Across the railroad tracks, in the

oldest section of Salem, sits an
ominous grey building bathed in

Mail Service
Isn't First Class

By LESLEY SAYELL

The mailroom probably is the
one place on the Pitt campus most
everyone looks forward to walking
to, with the hope there will be
something inside the box to break
the Cobwebs.

Some days, one must wonder if
mother forgot how to write, or
conclude there is something
deﬁnitely wrong with the mail
service at Pitt. According to Bill
Mueller, Towers mailroom em-
ployee, one reason why students
don’t receive expected mail is that
it is incorrectly addressed.

“A lot of the mail is incorrectly
addressed,” Mueller said, “and
that’s why it is slow in getting to
the student.”

“If letters are addressed to the
University of Pittsburgh, we direct
them to the Cathedral of Learning
mailroom,” Mueller said. “This
could delay that mail for a couple of
days. If the letters were correctly
addressed, they would come
directly to the Towers.”

Mueller said all mail that enters
the Towers mailroom is placed into
students’ boxes the day it arrives.

“All correctly addressed mail
goes directly into the boxes,”
Mueller said. “Box numbers are
looked up for letters that are
incorrectly addressed. This takes
time, but even this mail is placed
into students’ boxes the same
day.”

There are two new signs in the
mailroom this year. The sign that
causes the greatest reaction from
students concerns stamps. Stamps
now are sold only between 9:30
a.m. and 4:30 p.m, Monday
through Friday, and there is a limit
of 10 stamps per student.

Some students could not care
less about the stamp situation,
since the Oakland Post Office is a
ﬁve minute walk from the Towers.
But access to stamps in the Towers
was a convenience to students. The
new process is inconvenient for
students who have part-time jobs

Musical Comedy

By TOBI ROSEN
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Where’s Ron? Why do we
always have to wait for him?”
asked Gilette Elvgren, director of
Pitt’s upcoming musical comedy
“A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum.”

“Listen. Quiet, please,” he
barked during a rehearsal break
between acts.

About 30 actors, dancers and
technicians gathered downstage in
the Stephen Foster Memorial
Theater, impatiently awaiting that
night’s verdict.

“The play is going to succeed or
fail in the ﬁrst 25 percent of the
show. Right now it’s failing. Every
entrance is too slow. It’s a bloody
dirge,” Elvgren said.

“A Funny Thing Happened...”
recounts the zany adventures of a
foxy servant whose overriding
ambition is to obtain his freedom.
The plot clings to classic ploys:
mistaken identities, disguises,
chase scenes and risque comedy.

“The whole Protean opening
falls ﬂat. It doesn't work at all.
We’ll have to ﬁnd a half hour
somewhere to put it together.”

With only two days until opening
night, the cast listened attentively
and settled back into the soft
chairs, relieved at not being a
target during this round of
criticism.

“Ron, (Wisniski) the basic way
to sell what you sing is to look at
the ﬁrst six rows. Try to reach out
and make eye contact with those
people. With the lights in your

eyes, you can’t see anything,” he
said.

   
   

Skynyrd.

Leon Wilkeson, Allen Collins, Ronnie Van Zant and Gary Rossington of Lynyrd

“When the girls were on stage,
your mouth was totally open. Flies
could get in," he chidded.

Elvgren didn’t expound in vague
professorial abstractions. He cited
speciﬁc weaknesses to whip this
largely inexperienced cast into a
comedic ensemble with expert
timing. .

“Trying to work on the one liners
is the biggest challenge,” Elvgren
said later during an interview.
“The ﬁrst act moves too slowly and
a lot of the slapstick is falling
tonight."

“It’s so hard to put it together
without an audience to respond to
the humor. It helps establish
rhythm and build conﬁdence,” he
said.

“A Funny Thing Happened...”
uses the fastpaced comic style of
silent movie greats Buster Keaton
and Mack (“Keystone Cops”)
Sennett, P.-lvgren explained.

Unlike silent movies, this show
requires both singers who can act
and actors who can sing.

From the 70 people who
auditioned, E-lvgren assembled 20
actors with limited vocal training.

To upgrade the quality of Pitt’s
acting program, Elvgren would like
to see a musical produced annually,
extending resources to include the
music and dance departments.

“The American musical comedy
is our one indiginous form of
theater. There's no reason to be
ashamed of it,” he insisted.

E-lvgren noted the most thriving
form of theater, from Broadway to
summer stock, is the musical. This
genre provides the greatest num-
ber of jobs in a profession swelled

Lynyrd Skynyrd:
‘One More Time’

ByJlMFARERI
Pitt News Staff Writer
Street Survivors
Lynyrd Skynyrd
MCA

A few years ago, a song called
“Sweet Home Alabama” pounced
on America and made everyone
holler “Lynyrd Skynyrd” until they
were blue in the face.

It was called “country rock” back
then, but Lynyrd Skynyrd soon
made that distinction irrelevant.
They were one of the ﬁnest, most
invigorating American rock bands
ever to grace vinyl.

Lynyrd Skynyrd, a poor-boy band
from Jacksonville, Florida, took a
version of a local high school
teacher’s name and made it
synonomous with a distinctive,
southern blend of rock’n’roll.

Lynyrd Skynyrd’s first two
albums and tour with The Who in
1973 shot the band straight to the
top of the rock hierarchy.

It was at the top that Lynyrd
Skynyrd stayed. Their last studio
album, “Gimme Back By Bullits,”
may have been their most
uninspired, but their reputation was
mighty enough to endure a low spot.

Their latest LP, ironically entitled
“Street Survivors,” went gold in
less than a week.

Perhaps it is too soon to say
“last:” ﬁve of the seven band
members survived last week’s
plane crash (though one of them,
bassist Leon Wilkeson, is in critical
condition with a broken back). But
would Lynyrd Skynyrd fans dare
imagine the hand without the late
Ronnie Van-Zant?

Lead singer-lyricist Van-Zant,
more than anyone else, stood for
Lynyrd Skynyrd. His lyrics-bold,
gutsy and dead-ahead. but also
sentimental and romantic—were
unexpendable to the band’s sound
and image. On stage or on record,
Van-Zant’s presence was stagger-
mg.

The other band member killed in
the crash was a guitarist Steve
Gaines, belated replacement for ace
songwriter Ed King, who left after
the third album. The new guitarist
was enlisted not only to ﬁll the third
guitar slot, but also to give the band
some fresh songwriting ideas.

“It’s signiﬁcant that future
students get a more varied
training,” he said.

He explained it takes “relaxed
magnetisism,” coupled with much
experience, to polish an actor’s
charisma.

F.~lvgren’s directorial responsi-
bility spilled over to the other
production devices.

To facilitate the quick-moving
chase sequences, a sturdy set was
needed.

Theater arts associate professor
Henry Heymann designed a
“comic seedy realism" set, equip-
ped with many doors and doorways
to allow a ﬂurry of action.

“We can’t have the walls
shaking during the chases,”
Heymann quipped.

Heymann combined Roman
architecture motifs with those from
burlesque theater to highlight the
musical’s tongue-in-cheek flavor.

Costume designer Heidi Pribram
also underlined the show’s humor
in her designs.

With the rehearsal of Act II
underway, Elvgran slouched down
into the eighth row center seat,
ﬂanked by several associates.
Elbows secure on both armrests,
his elapsed hands grazed his
upturned upper lip.

No awkward gesture escaped the
scrutinv of his Qritical eve.

Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Album

(Continued from Page 10)

while Gaines wrote two with
Van-Zant and two on his own. The
crash claimed the two most vital
members of the band: the mainstay
and the new blood.

Is “Street Survivors” a ﬁtting
end to the Skynyrd saga? The
honest fari must admit this is not
the Lynyrd Skynyrd of the ﬁrst
three LPs, and that “Street
Survivors” has nothing to match
songs like “Freebird.” However,
this is an exceptional album; it
reveals the band moving into a
delayed second phase.

What Lynyrd Skynyrd will be best
remembered by is abundant on
“Street Survivors:” tight, imagina-
tive guitar jamming. Listen to the
music toward the end of “That
Smell” and see if it isn’t some of the

AA AAAAAAAAAA

hottest Skynyrd ever has played.

If one is looking for numbers with
the characteristic Van-Zant feel,
there is “What’s Your Name,” a
funky road tune, and “One More
Time,” a slow but potent “Free-
bird”-type tune. As is most of the
material on "Street Survivors,”
these two songs are intricate, and
less rock-oriented, than previous
Lynyrd Skynyrd material.

The Gaines tunes are impressive.
Gaines was clearly moving the band
in new directions.

Both of the songs he wrote
challenge Lynyrd Skynyrd to adapt
their sound and style of play to
material they weren’t accustomed
to playing and, in both instances,
the band comes out shining.

The tunes are “I Know A Little,”
racy, 1950-style country rock, and

AAAAAA¢AALAALA

AAAAAAAA

“Ain’t No Good Life," hardy blues
on which Gaines puts down a
formidable vocal.

The Van-Zant—-Gaines numbers
also are ﬁnely wrought. The two
writers share the vocal on “You’ve
Got That Right,” a jumping,
straight-ahead rocker neatly
sprinkled with Billy Powell’s piano
work. “I Never Dreamed” is even
better, with its easy rhythm.
acoustics and careful integration.

That leaves the only ﬂat track on
the album: “Honky Tonk Night
Time Man,” written by Van-Zant’s
boyhood idol Merle Haggard.

This sixth and ﬁnal LP is the ﬁrst
chapter in part two of Lynyrd
Skynyrd’s career, a story that
unfortunately must end here.

g; Q HA4;

Did you know that the University of Pittsburgh has established the University Honors
Program (UHP)? Did you know that starting this coming winter term you may take
courses co-sponsored by the UHP? Interested? Read on.

What does it mean for a course to be co-sponsored by the UHP?
Courses co-sponsored by the UHP are intended to be
challenging and stimulating for ambitious students. Co-sponsored
courses are offered by departments throughout the University and
must be approved by the UHP Advisory Board subject to the
previous criteria.

Are UHP courses just more advanced or specialized? No. The
UHP is particularly interested in challenging courses with minimal
prerequisites. Most of our Winter Term courses (see list below) do
not have any prerequisites. However, the courses may be fast
paced.

Why should I take a UHP course? Most classes will be small with
stimulating discussions. They will provide students an opportunity
to have personal contact with their professors and other motivated
students.

If I apply to graduate or professional school, will the UHP in-
dicate on transcripts and through letters of recommendation
that I took courses that were intended to be especially
challenging? Yes. You achieve and we'll tell people about it. The
best recommendations are written by faculty who know their
students well.

Will some students be able to graduate with both departmental
honors and university-wide honors? Yes. Details to be announ-
ced.

How may I recieve mailings of general announcements regar-
ding UHP courses and co-curricular offerings? How may 1 find
out more about the courses listed below for this coming winter
term? Visit or call Susan in the UHP Office, 1204 C.L., Ext. 6880.
Detailed course descriptions are available in the UHP Office and all
advising centers.

Does the UHP co-sponsor independent study or research oppor-
tunities? Yes. There are ten already available for Winter Term
1978. They cover a variety of topics ranging from “Experimental
Studies of Sound Propagation in the Human Chest” to “Studies in
Risk-Benefit Analysis.” Please Contact the UHP Office for additional
information.

Who can take a winter term course co-sponsored by the UHP?
Any undergraduate student who has a QPA of 3.25 or above, or
special permission.

How do I register for one of the following UHP courses this
coming winter term? Drop by the UHP Office, 1204 C.L., for a
permission slip. Then register as usual. We want to meet students
interested in honors calibre work.

Booters to Hit the Rocky Road

By JEFF DUROSKO

A tough road trip is in store for
the Pitt soccer team in the next
three weeks, when it will travel to
lock Haven, Penn State, West
Virginia and Indiana (Pa.) to ﬁnish
out the regular season.

The Panthers (6-4-1) will hope to
extend their two-game winning
streak when they face Lock Haven
Friday afternoon. The Eagles have
defeated Pitt the last two years;
they won last season, 1-0, at Pitt
Stadium.

Looking at Lock Haven (7-4),
Panther coach Leo Bemis said,
“They play a good game of soccer.
Lock Haven has good talent and

" speed and plays a hard, aggressive

game. ’ ’

The Panthers hope to counteract
this aggressiveness with one of

their offensive explosions. In its six
wins, Pitt has outscored its
opponents 35-1. This is in great
contrast to last season, when the
Panthers scored only 10 goals in 13
games.

The Eagles have had a few
impressive victories of their own
this year, beating Indiana (Pa.), 5-0,
in overtime. The Indians had only
one other loss this season. Lock
Haven has defeated strong LaSalle
College at LaSalle. LaSalle in turn
defeated Philadelphia Textile,
which had been highly rated in the
East all season.

Against Lock Haven, the booters
will depend on their leading scorer,
Craig Connolly. Connolly has
tallied nine goals, followed closely

by John O'Hara with six and Marty
Moyer and Mark Nigh with four
goals each.

The Eagle booters have a _few
hard-hitting players who may give
the Panthers some problems. For
instance, Dave Connor is a tough.
hard-shooting individual and left-
wing Jim Taber is being touted by
Lock Haven as a standout

Derformer.
“We look for them to be a team

about the caliber of Grove City or
Slippery Rock, maybe 0116 8031
better on their home ﬁeld,”
explained Bemis. “They are very

strong at home, where the home
crowd advantage is a key factor,
especially if their team has you
down."

If the Panthers can protect their
two- game win streak and eventually
extend it to six, an NCAA playoff
berth is possible. " And who
knows—-they may get a national
championship in the sport that the
rest of the world calls football.

 

Wednesday, October 26, 197‘1—THE PITT NEWS-Page 13 '

Pin News Staff Writer

“That's what the game is all
about,” Pitt head coach Jackie
Sherrill said of bowl trips.
“Awards are for winners.”

Such seems to be the philosophy
of the Panther football squad, a
belief that must be carried into
Saturday's contest against Tulane
(2-4) at Pitt Stadium if the Panthers
hope to make a bowl trip this
season.

“Last spring, we were not a
national championship team, not a
great team, not even a good team,”
Sherrill said. “I would have taken
a 7-4 season as successful. But our
players accomplished a lot, worked
hard and dedicated themselves to
being a good football team. Right
now, with everyone healthy, we are
a good team.”

Tulane doesn't fall into that
category at the moment, but the
Green Wave still can provide
enough surprises to end all Pitt
hopes of post-season play.

“Tulane is the type of team that
gives you many different forma-
tions on offense,” Sherrill ex-
plained. “In their last three
games, they used 43 different
formations . ”

“We try to scratch and bite for
every little thing we can get,”
Tulane head coach Smith claimed.
“That’s how we play and we will
stick to that game plan against
Pitt.”

Defensively, the Green Wave
will play tricks with different
defensive formations, bent on
stopping Pitt’s quick offensive
attack.

“They line u__p_in~an eiht-man

 

 

front to get their cornerback and
strong safety into the running
defense,” Sherrill said. “That
could mean they will give us the
pass. I hope they do-—there are
very few secondaries in the country
that can play man-to-man against
us. People will have to start
playing balanced defense against
Pitt.”

Balanced defense wasn't exactly
the Panthers’ forte last Saturday
against Syracuse, although Pitt’s
starting lineup was befuddled by
injuries.

“When you prepare for a game
facing the number of injuries we
did,” Sherrill complained, “you
can't teach those new players every
little thing. Syracuse hurt us most
with motion plays——something they
didn't use but three or four times
the entire season. But I don't try to
outguess myself, overcoach the
players—I just let them go at it.
We have very few checks in our
game plan.” 1,

That game plan probably will

be followed again this week,
considering the amount of injured.
Willie Taylor, Matt Carroll, Lind-
say Delaney, Gary Tyra, Mike
Lenoski and possibly Hugh Green
will miss the Tulane match. But
Matt Cavanaugh’s cast is ﬁnally
off, and names like Gordon Jones,
Steve Gaustad and Fred Jacobs
should become even more promi-
nent in the scoring statistics,
quelling early-season alarm over
lack of offense.

“But I still think we need a
better balanced attack,” Sherrill
said;

That’s what the game is all

Pitt Plus 10---That Easy State College Money

Since money these days is no more scarce than are
parking spots in Oakland, Ifeel it only proper to reveal
what I believe to be a sure-ﬁre, lucrative business
proposition. It involves Pitt, Penn State and the
ancient vice of betting.

The untapped riches of which I speak sit snugly in
the wallets of a great number of Penn State football
fans, particularly those who ‘cast ﬁnancial prudence to
the wind when a wager involving the Nittanies is
offered.

There are certain residents of State College who are
willing to bet real money—legitimate American
green——that Joe Patemo's boys will beat Pitt by at
least 10 points—at least 10 pointsll Such untempered
and ill-advised chauvinism has not been seen since
Custer made himself even money against Sitting Bull.

Now, I'm certainly not trying to say that the Nov. 26
Pitt-Penn State showdown will be a massacre in either
direction. The point I am trying to convey is that it is
nothing less than folly to spot 10 points in a bet on a
game between two teams matched fairly evenly——ev-
en in theloathsome feelings each team harbors for the
other. In short, he who takes Pitt plus 10 over PSU will
surely ﬁnd himself a richer man Nov. 27.

Let's look at the facts, which will be expertly
provided by the same person who told me about the
easy money ﬂoating around State College. His name
is Jeff and he is, in no particular order: a senior at
Penn State; a long-time drinking buddy of Pitt’s
Randy Holloway; a staunch Pitt fan; a-man who was a
very ﬁne outside linebacker before his college career
was cut short by knee surgery and legitimately
proclaims himself ‘ ‘a student of the game of football. ”

From this unique vantage point—two of his pals and
teammates on the PSU weightlifting team are Bruce
Clarke and Matt Millen, the Nit’s defensive
tack1es—he is, I believe, extremely capable of giving
an accurate and informative breakdown on the game.
(As well as cleaning out some wallets!)

“Most people I’ve talked to down here (State
College) are happy to give Pitt plus 10 points,” he

championship by breaks. And that’s crazy.”

Jeff added that other popular sentiments around
Beaver Stadium are that Tony Dorsett was
“lucky” last year against Penn State, and that
Holloway and the entire Pitt defense will be
outmatched because “Penn State will be ready for him
this year.”

Despite this selective blindness of some of the fans,
the Nittany Lion football team itself is not without
considerable merit.

“Chuck Fusina is a solid quarterback; he’s
deﬁnitely a ﬁne passer, ”.J eff said. “He has poise, he
sets up well and puts the ball where he wants to."

 

How about the receivers?

“Jimmy Cefalo (ﬂanker) is having a good year
because he’s stayed pretty healthy. He's fast and Pitt
will have to watch him. Mickey Shuler (tight end) is
like Jim Corbett (ex-Panther, now with the Cincinnati
Bengals). He’s a solid blocker and has great bands.

“Scott Fitzkee, the split end, won't be as much of a

problem, I don't think. His best games are against
lousy teams. Kentucky shut him down completely,
and with Pitt’t great defensive backﬁeld, I'm pretty
sure they’ll do the same thing.”

Penn State has deﬁnitely lived by the pass this year,
and Pitt with Matt Cavanaugh directing the offense,
also has shown no reluctance to put the ball in the air.
And therein lies what might be the most critical factor

K in determining who goes home after the game

muttering, “Wait ‘til next year.”

“The secondary has looked pretty shabby,” he
said. “They play too far off the line—against
Maryland,Rich Milot (comerback) was giving his man
15 yards. They just don't react to the ball the way Joe

'~Patemo's teams usually do. But their main problem
has been that when they've been in a situation where
they've had to stop the pass, they've looked real bad.
Syracuse came back and almost beat them in the
fourth quarter. Penn State just couldn't stop the
pass.”

But a team coached by Joe Paterno is never a
slouch. And if the Panthers continue their charitable
ways of fumbling as often as they have, they will ﬁnd
themselves in dire trouble. The rest of Paterno’s
defense is typically tough and only too happy to take
advantage of opponent's mistakes.

“Millen and Clarke are really starting to come
around at defensive tackle,” he said. “They're both
sophmores, -and both started last year at (inside)

F edell Has Starting Itch

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

A limp ‘and an itch may have
amounted to the opportunity of a
lifetime for Pitt football player Steve
Fedell in Pitt’s 28-21 win over
Syracuse Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

With starter Hugh Green nursing
a sore ankle and back-up Greg
Meisner coming down with a case of
chickenpox a few days before the
game, the freshman from North
Hills, listed at linebacker on Pitt’s
pre-game depth chart, got the

opportunity by recording countless
tackles, assists and quarterback
sacks, including a crucial stop he
made on Syracuse quarterback Bill
Hurley as Syracuse threatened to
score with a few minutes left in the
game.

‘ ‘I wasn’t sure I was going to start
until Wednesday,” Fedell said. “I
knew Hugh probably wouldn’t play,
but I thought for sure Greg would.

“Until I saw these big red dots all
over Greg’s chest Monday, ” Fedell
added with a grin. “I had a feeling

to be a medical doctor, his prognosis
in this case was right on the money.
Meisner had chickenpox and would
deﬁnitely miss the upcoming game,
allowing Fedell to step in at the
vacant end position.

“A few days before the game,”
Fedell stated, “Coach (Jimmy)
Johnson began to show me what to
expect in certain situations. I
hadn’t really played defensive end
before Saturday. I was used to
playing linebacker, so I really didn’t
know what to look for.

a starting defensive left end.

“Then, Coach showed me what to Freshman Steve Fedell (58), shown here sacking Syracuse quarterback Bill”,
“When to Hurley, made his first collegiate start against the Orange last Saturday and '
contributed greatly to the Panther’s 28-21 victory.

Remember Past Tournaments, Forget Last Year

If it’s true that “everyone loves a winner,” where
does that leave the Pitt basketball team?

Consider the pattern of the team’s recent history:

“Part of the dismay the Cat fans felt that night,
(over a loss to Duquesne in the Civic Arena before
10,000 fans) must have turned to agony as they wit-
nessed the explosion of another well-fashioned myth.
Once again a supposedly great Pitt squad was floun-
dering in mediocrity” (The Pitt News, Jan. 10, 1972).

That season, Buzz Ridl’s team finished with a 12-
12 record, but this was acceptable at Pitt partly
because no one had a national championship football
team to compare it with (on the contrary, football
was the weaker sport). Surprisingly, in the article,
there was a paragraph that could be neatly and ap-
propriately fitted into any story about Pitt basketball
last year:

“Charting the course of Pitt’s basketball season to
date is similar to mapping the ups and downs of a
roller coaster ride—although the valleys are deeper
and the hills far from thrillingly high.”

Pitt was a mediocre 12-14 in 1972-73, but, by this
time, outstanding players such as Billy Knight and
Mickey Martin had adjusted to varsity competition.
The future looked promising, but turned out better
than even Tiger Paul, the Fieldhouse’s unofficial
cheerleader, had dreamed.

With the addition of only one regular player,
junior college transfer, Lew I-Iill, Panther basketball
also underwent a major change.

“Following an 82-78 loss at WVU, the Pitt basket-
ball team has erupted for 11 straight victories, their
best start since the 1929-30 season.” (The Pitt News,
Jan. 11, 1974).

Victories piled up to a 25-3 record as the Cats at-

tracted national attention. The tricky “amoeba

defense” finally had been mastered and the team’s

smooth, 6-6 forward gave everyone a Knight to
remember.

In the same way, football fans are not seriously
longing for another national championship, the
1974-75 hoopers had a tough act to follow. This was
generally understood by the fans and news media.

 

Graduation had left large gaps in the forecourt
positions and two freshmen, Mel Bennett and Larry
I-Iarris, were expected to be of great help.

After a sluggish start, the team played well, if at
times erratically. Wins over Marquette, Notre Dame
and Rutgers somehow were combined with inex-
plicable losses to Bucknell and Kent State to wind up
an 18-11 campaign. Following the previous year’s
lead of attending a post-season tournament, Pitt
received a National Invitational Tournament (NIT)
bid.

This would not have been necessary if the Panthers
had not run into some West Virginia—style “home—
cooking” while vying for a stronger NCAA berth. A
four-team tournament was held at season’s end in the
WVU Coliseum, and the winner was assured of an

NCAA spot. As expected, the Panthers drew the
home team. Despite Bennett’s 22 points and 21
rebounds, Pitt could not overcome some rather
unusual officiating and ended up losing, by two poin-
ts, the first of two rounds.

Before Grgurich’s first season as head coach
began, troubles arose like creeping ivy. Sophomore
sensation Bennett signed a pro contract with the
Virginia Squires, and 6-11 freshman Kelvin Smith
was ruled academically ineligible. Unbelievably, mat-
ters worsened. Veteran guard Tom Richards broke
his right (shooting) wrist and another top scorer,
Keith Starr, hadn’t even played a full game before he
seriously injured his knee.

Although hardly a constant winner of games, this
scrappy team won admiration for their gutsy, am-
bitious style of play, despite a 12-15 won-loss mark.

The 1976-77 season came as a shock to the most
diehard fans. At times, Pitt started three freshmen,
together with only one experienced player. The
disastrous 6-21 season was in part due to a lack of
depth, a lack of experience and the lack of more than
one returning regular over 6-5.

In the contagiously optimistic mood of Grgurich, A"

it’s safe to say this year’s squad has nowhere to go
but up. Four players are gone, but as of yet, Mike
Rice is the only starter who will not be available.
Even so, he will be back in January should his grades
improve.

The Panthers’ fairly easy schedule, plus the ad-
dition of yet another City League MVP Sam Clancy,
means the team could surpass the .500 level. And af-
ter 6-2], that would be a winner.

‘passing, while HC plays a more

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Sparked by the pinpoint passing
of Ron Dandrea and a defense that
hasn't allowed a single point in two
games, Hogger City defeated
Pussy Posse, 27-0, in a key Division
P contest at Trees Field.

The game was expected to be a
tough battle between veteran
teams, with both squads ﬁelding
basically the same rosters that
propelled them into the playoffs
last year.

PP entered with a reputation for
using the ground game to set up its

wide-open offense in an effort to
take advantage of its stable of wide
receivers.

The majority of the first half was
dominated by conservatism. PP
concentrated on its running, and
poor field position hampered HC.
With 10 plays left in the first half,
Dandrea caught PP in a man-to-
man coverage and lofted a 30-yard
pass to Dave Kretz, who made a
diving catch inside the 10-yard line.
Three plays later, Jeff Olczak
hauled in Dandrea’s one-yard pass
for the score, and Michael Star's

When to drop back on passes.

“There’s a little more responsi-
bility involved in playing defensive
end,” Fedell explained. “You have
to know when to rush, when to drop
back. At linebacker, there are only
certain occasions when you rush the
passer, or blitz.

“You have to remember certain
little things, too,” the freshman
went on. “On one occasion, I lined
up on the wrong side of the ﬁeld. It
really isn’t as serious as it sounds,
since we do have a stunt where we
both line up on the same side.

“Coach Johnson pulled me out

for a couple of plays,” Fedell
stated. “But I remember Coach
ll asking me, ‘Son, why did
you do that?’
. “I definitely have room to

aftefthought. “I’m just glad I had
the chance to start.”

That he did. Thanks to a limp and
an itch.

point after gave HC a 7-0 lead.

PP took the ensuing kickoff, and
marched to two consecutive first
downs behind the passing com-
bination of Dave Stahura to Dave
Ruppersburger, but the half ended
without further scoring.

HC received the second half.

kick-off, and three straight end
sweeps brought the ball to
midfield. On the next play,
Dandrea, who had plenty of time to
pass all night, threw to Kretz.
Ruppersburger intercepted to kill
the drive.

Behind the running of Stahura
and Phil Wu, PP moved the ball
into HC territory. After Kretz broke
up a pass on third down, Stahura
punted into the end zone.

On the next two plays, Dandrea
had all his receivers covered, but
scrambled for large chunks of
yardage and HC was threatening
again. Two plays later, Kretz made
another diving catch for the
touchdown. Star's conversion up-
ped the lead to 14-0.

On the next series, PP, behind

catch by Ruppersburger, found

Stahura’s next pass was inter-
cepted by Kretz in the end zone.

HC went right to work; a short
gain by Kretz was followed by a
long pass to Star, and the ball was
on the PP 15-yard line. After an
incompletion, Dandrea lofted a
perfect pass to Rick Wahal, who
gathered it in in the corner of the
end zone for the score. The kick
was wide and HC held a 20-0 lead.

Dandrea intercepted Stahura on
the next series, and returned the
ball to the PP 20-yard line. The
next play ended the scoring and
was a carbon copy of the previous
HC touchdown—Dandrea to Wahal
upped the count to 26-0.

Tim DeMartino summed up PP’s
disappointment. “We lost a couple
guys from last year's team, and we
have a new quarterback, but that
shouldn’t have mattered that
much. Iguess you’d have to say we
didn't play too well.”

Dandrea, on the other hand, was
pleased to have a win.
