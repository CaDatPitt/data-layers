Panthers Clawless--Our A]

By ALEX ZELENSKI, Sports Editor, Pitt News

With the solid backing of more than 500 stu-
dents, a handful of cheerleaders, and the famed
Pitt marching band, Pitt’s clawless Panthers en-
trained last night for Ann Arbor, Michlgan where
they hope to topple the Michigan VVolver1nes from
the ranks of the undefeated.

The local students who plan to see tomorrow's
grid battle will once again see their team go lnt0
the contest on the short end of the odds. But
whether the Panthers are favorites or underdogs;
the students will expect their team to put all out,
and in return will show the Big Nine fans what
Pitt spirit means.

It is rather embarrassing to compare the records
of the two teams for the Wolverines show 2 wins
and no defeats while the Jungle Cats have yet to
win their ﬁrst.

Michigan State, in their inaugural contest, 20-6,

Conference

More than 12,000 teachers, ad-
ministrators, and educators are
meeting today in the vicinity of
the University, for the thirteenth
annual meeting of the Western
Pennsylvania Education confer-
ence.

According to Dietz, rush week

day morning, at which time fra-
ternity silence week will be en-
forced. During this period fra-
ternity men will not be permitted.
to contact freshmen regarding fra-

ii’ Main theme of the conference
is the physical and mental prepar-
edness of the nation, and particu-
larly of its youth. Most of yes-

theme and the program scheduled
for today and tomorrow, the ﬁnal
two days of the conference, are

expected to carry this theme out

even further.

Future State

By EDGAR BEICEL

An intellectual forecast_of' the
state of the future was the theme
of the first meeting of the Social
Science seminar in the Faculty
club la.st Wednesday._ Albert B.
Martin, instructor political
science, spoke on “The Composi-
tion and Strategy of the Man-
agerial State,” which he claimed
would be the “next stage of pol-
itical society.”

Wednesday’s seminar of the
faculties of the social sciences
was the ﬁrst of the year's series,
in which a member of each de-
partment will discuss “some as-
pect of the contribution of his
discipline to an understanding of
the impact of the current scene
upon American civilization."

in

Immediate Basis

The immediate. basis for Mar-
tin’s discussion of the “managerial
state” was the publication last
spring of “The Managerial Revolu-
tion: What is Heappeninglin the
.World,'’’ by James Burnham, an
instructor in politics 'atNYU.

Martin summarized But-nham’s
thesis as “setting forth the theo-
ry that capitalist society--—-marked
by production of commodities
for profit, a money economy,
periodic economic crises and a
two class society-—is being ;up.
planted not by a socialist society
(marked by classlessness, free-
dom and internationalism), but
by a managerial society, one dom-
inated by those who perform the
tasks of technical direction and
coordination of the processes of
production."

The Shift

Tracing" the shift of the dom-
inant social and political group
as the machine-age developed in
America, from the agrarian class
to the ' ‘bsiness groups, the in-
dustrial capitalists, finance cap-
italists, and finally the urban mas-
ses, Martin claimed that “what
Berle and Means found to be true
of the modern corporation is also
coming to be true in government,
namely that management’, bure-
aucracy

Hughes and Barr can ‘be confused.
Seriously though, they apologized
and ‘said it was a misprint.

-Everybody’s been a saying.
“We've heard" enough about the
nice frosh women——why not let

ing it upon ourselves to go off
the deep and do something about

We’re for: Wilma Dickey’s Bill

Wenzel, who has his. eye on Janet
Elliot, in spite of the Pi Ka house’s
priority rites there; Tut Patrick,
who also sems to be on Hughes’
and Barr’s “sucker” list.

There's quite a’ story behind
the page of pictures of pinned
Pitt pretties ,in the Panther last
week. On the day the pictures
were to be taken, one of the girls
forgot to wear her pin. Probably
the only time she'd" forgotten
since he had given it to her.

But anyhow——the Panther and
the girl were in a panic. What to

‘do? Naley called the house of said

fraternity pin and a pledge dashed
over with another brother’s pin.
So came the Panthers and the pic-
tures; one of the girls was wearing
the. wrong man's pi-n. We can’t

The Purpose

The purpose of the social com-
mittee is to formulate or change
and to enforce fairly all SFA so-
cial regulations.

Rules
The committee sets uniform
social standards by regulating

the hours, places the registra-
tion on University calendars, the
number of hostesses, and the re-
sponsibility of social chairmen-—
for all sociallaffairs where both
men and women are present.

The Program: 1941-42

The fall program of the social
committee will inaugurate sur-
prise tea dances on Lilly court
and several informal gatherings
at Heinz house after the home
football games.

These events,‘ will fulfill the
primary aim of‘ this year's social
committee which is to encourage
and foster the participation of
the student body as a whole in
all new social events. By hav-
ing these affairs very informal,
at times when the majority of
the students are free, and charg-

ing only a nominal fee, or no
entrance fee, the committee be-
lieves that this aim can be
reached. ’

The winter program will ini-
tiate a Snow Carnival on the Ca-
thedral lawn. The four class
dances are evenly’ distributed on
the calendar.

The,spring schedule will con-
tinue with the Surprise dances,
and of course, include Spring Fes-
tival week with its many tradi-
tional competitive contests, car-
nivals and dances.

The committee is planning to
supplement the weekly Wednes-
day afternoon teas by informal,
brief discussions and talks by fac-
ulty members. These teas will
then serve to make stronger and
broader bonds between faculty
and stu_dent_body. No student of
the University can make a bind-
mg contract‘ without having ﬁrst
obtained the social committee’s
official approval to hold the affair.

Violation of this rule will cost
' the student from ﬁve.to~‘ ft dol

helped bring about this condition.

Indeed, the amount of graft
prevalent in the AFL may be
quite great, and it is to be ad-
mitted that little has been done
by leaders, at Pegler’s instigation,
to alleviate the situation. But
it seems to us that Westbrook
Pegler has become a crusader not
only against corruption in unions,
but also against unions and the
union idea.

If he doesn’t believe in the un-
ion idea. let him compare the sit-
uation of American labor before
union inﬂuence. He should dis-
cover, in looking up the matter,
terms like “12 hour day,” “ill-
ness,” “death at young age,”
“filth,” “exploitation.” How much
of the reform that has been
achieved would be here if employ-
ers had been left to handle labor
and grant improvments of their
own volition?

The corruption in organized
labor must be cleaned up, and we
would cheer any further action
by Pegler in this direction. lit
is also to be fervently hoped,
for labor-’s sake and for Ameri-
ca's sake, that union executives
apply themselves to this task. But
let it not be forgotten that labor
needs a voice to speak out against
injustice and exploitation by em-
ployers, and the stifling of that
voice would be a folly of the grav-
est consequences.

Shallnd nter
AEF To Help England?

By HORACE UMBERCER

So ‘far, England has not in-
vaded the continent of Europe in
order to ease the burden of Rus-
sia in fighting Germany. And
Prime Minister Churchill intimates
that no English forces will cross
the Channel unless accompanied
by. an AEF.

There is the nub of a predica-
ment which must receive more
attention from American people
than it has in the past. Time
has come for us to decide wheth-
er or not we want our army to
go to war now.

By judging public opinion on
this matter, as it now stands, a
good interperter should get In
nnswer somewhat as follows:

Cake and Eat It

The American people are
against going to war in Europe.
They see that regardless of what
happens on the other side of the
Atlantic, this side will not neces-
sarily go to a like destruction.

Nearly everyone wants England
to be the victor. And to bring
this about, they have determined
to send the implements of war
to the whole Empire. To all Amer-
icans, world_ dominance under
Anglo-American rule is prefer-
able to that of Germany.

But the opinion prevails that
men shall not accompany the
‘mechanical aid which goes to
England. Our soldiers cannot be
spared. They have a destiny to
fulfill in bringing about unity
in the western hemisphere.

Livos for Defense

Building up impregnable de-
fenses in all the Americas is the
task to which our lives are com-
mitted. ‘For even though Russia
may fall and England‘ collapse,
America will yet stand to defend
itself against all enemies. This,
the people feel, represents a more
logical program than the one
where we stand or fall in Europe.

A few important factors con-
tribute to America’: decision to
keep our army at home. First,
and foremost, preparation of
home defenses, on a hemispheric
scale, has not yet passed the
embryonic stage of growth.

Mayer, Myers Spell:
On Literature Topics

Fredrick P. Mayer, associate
professor of English, will explain
“How to Judge a Novel” when he
lectures before the Monongahela
City club on October 17.

The C'ollege club of Pittsburgh
will hear Dr. Walter H. Myers,
professor of English, discuss the
literature of the southwest, next
Wednesday.

ln a military sense, our pre-
paration falls far short of its
goal. We do not now have an
army capable of defending both
North and South America from
invasion. Reason for this is that
the men in the drafted forces
are not fully trained.

A Year Makes No Soldier

One year's training does not
turn a man into a soldier, as
General Marshall proved. Nu-
mericaly, the army will soon be
large enough. But a most signif-
icant trend in military tactics is
that toward higher mechaniza-
tion. This quality has yet to be
.instilled into the American army.
lt will come only after several
years of service.

And so, the American people
conclude that all those impetuous
sons who cry for war now can
do one obvious favor for the rest
of us. These anxious persons
may pack up and leave at once

Wearing the correct and smartest‘

clothes this season; a few ideas
Worth your consideratic-n:

If you’re that short and pudgy
type, retreat behind a long tunic
or subtle hip-drapery. ‘You'll
be amazed at the long-waisted
effect it brings. If you're the
tall and “little-in-between" type,
try the ever popular dirndl, or
the row upon row of tiers to give
you those needed curves. The
pleated or draped effect also does
wonders.

For town or class, afternoon tea
or heavy date, wear silhouettes in
woolens, in jersey, in rabbit’s. hair
and angora. ,T_hey’ll add glamor_
even to Agatha J0néS_. 7‘

And for that next battle at the
stadium nothing can be more at-
tractive or more serviceable than a
checked or plaid suit with the ever
popular porkpie to add to that col-
legiate z-ing. We guarantee the
attention you. will receive.

For dining and dancing, vel-
Veteelh corduroy and bengalines
are musts on your list for your
next few weeks’ shopping. They
will make HIM look twice.and
see you in a different light.

As for colors, black is, as usual,
on top of the list, but beige andpr
gray and creamy or toasty tans are
close seconds. Also, bright greens,
delicate yellows, and striking pur-
ples, as well as the old standbys
blue and red, for whole costumes or
for that popular contrast effect.

: Freshmen who successfully
passed the exams may receive
their blue and gold armbands to-

to 1:30 o’clock. After that time,
they may be obtained from the
dean of women's office.

Since there is no way to inform
freshmen whether or not they
have passed the examination, they
.have been requested to find out

for themselves in 1201 Cathedral.

Weekly Social Teas

Mrs. J. K. Miller, hostess in the

At Dinner

Addressing approximately 150
women leader_s at “one of the most
important if not the most impor-
tant meeting of the year,” Chancel-

-lor John G. Bowman stressed the
-importance of living in the “human

commonwealth” at the annual of-
ﬁcers’ night dinner which took
place in the Heinz house Tuesday.

“I believe this meeting is im-
portant,’’': Dr. Bowman said, “be-
cause this highly selective group
of women here tonight are an in-
ﬂuential part of the University,

and through their leadership they

may help to make their University
inﬂuential.”

The Chancellor pointed out the
necessity of living in a human
commonwealth as well as in‘ an
economic commonwealth. He con-
ceded the point that we must be
practical, but reminded the group
that we should never lose sight
of the human values. I

“Find yourself an eternal ideal,”
he counseled, “and hang_on to it,
till the blood comes to your eyes,
if necessary. Then you‘will be
really living.”

Helen Pool Rush, acting dean
of women, presided at the dinner
which was held in honor of all of
the officers of women’s organ-

izations, presidents of honorary’

and social fraternities, WSGA
committee chairman, unit advis-
ors, senior court, class officers
and publications representatives.

of the triple-threat skills very
adequately. He is a strong
power runner with fair speed and
he has pnnted this far with
amazing accnrateness. But the
204-pound speedster is very weak
on the business end of an aerial
attack, consequently the Wolver-
ines have had none to speak of.

who knows all the tricks-—moves

up from reserves to replace all-
American Ed Frutig.

Left Tackle-—REUBEN KELTO
--a powerful giant who flanks
one of the toughest tackle-to-tackle
walls in the country——good of-
fensive man——regarded as one of
the most reliable all—a.round line-
men on the squad.

Left gasrd—WlLLlAM MEL-
ZOW—~steady veteran—excellent
place kicker—deaclly downfield
blocker.

Center -— BOB INGALLS -
smart defensive center-——equally
reliable on offense——-seldom makes
a. bad pass—from Kiski Prep.

Right guai-d——BOB KOLESAR
-—fast, hard charger-also a fast
talker whose wit keeps the Wol-
verine line on its toes--—moved up
to first string midway through
last season.

Right taclcle--ALBERT “0X"
WISTERT-—-named on several all-
Americans as sophomore last
yea.r—-learned all his football at
Michig-a'n——packs 210 pounds on a

Left I-lalfback —— TOM KUZMA
—— Sophomore — 6 foot, 200
pounds —- p o w e r f ul runner and
good kicker —— has been weak on
passing thus far — but is hailed
by the Wolverines as a bigger and
better edition of the terrible Tom-

tough -— packs 190 pounds on a

Last year the Panthers came
closer to beating the Navy than
at any other time since the series
started. The first half ended in a
scoreless deadlock, but the Middies
scored early in the third period af-
ter receiving the kickoff from Pitt.
A twenty—ﬁve yard pass combined
with a twenty-yard run netted the
Navy their touchdown, after which
they converted.

Plenty of Spirit .

In the ﬁnal quarter the Panth-
ers made a valiant effort to get
back in the game as they went on
a sustained drive from their own
ten to the Middie one. Frank Sas-
ka then plunged over from the one
and Pitt was back in the game.
However, Fitchko’s attempted con-

version was blocked and the Navy

had sunk the Panthers.
The showing made by Navy’s
varsity squad last Saturday gives

one the feeling that their “milk

squad” should be stronger this
year too. Notwithstanding this,
the Panther jayvee team will be in
there ﬁghting their hardest to
make up for last year's heart-
breaking loss.

There is a great deal of poten-

And before very long, the Bow-

The highly-touted “Blue-devils
will need more than their share of
the “breaks” to keep that record
clean. Maryland was a strong
team last year, and has been im-

campaign. A Terrapin upset

The Rams won’t be able to do

much ramming through that North

“no scoring punch.” Not much
ramming. . . . Just enough for a
victory.

NEBRASKA I4, KANSAS I2

The Kansas kiddies are all up in
the air. They have one of the
slickest passing attacks in the
country. If the Cornhuskers can
bring them down to earth, that
consecutive winning streak will re-
main intact for a while. But it'll
be a tough task. And the contest
may even end in a tie.

ERE may be little traffic at 35,000 feet, but test-diving any new,

 Drive Begins to /\ir Tuck Shops;
Recording Machine Suggested

The Student-Faculty association set machinery into mo-

 tion this week to alleviate the serious shortage of lockers in
. the Cathedral and‘ elsewhere on the campus, to clear the Tuck

shops of cigarete smoke either by the restriction of smoking
or by the introduction of some mechanical device, and to pro-
yide the new Blue and Gold Tuck shop with a record player.

FA w.:us..:.L..:....,

-* to
date last week in a petition, spon-
sored principally by Clarence Tyl-
 er, E42; and John Knoll, E42, and
. ‘signed by more than 500 students.
' The Plan

cpecially anoying during

Student interest in’ these
innovations and reforms is
to be tested through the
use of ballots to determine
whether or not there is a real
and not imaginary shortage of
locker facilities and whether or
[not there is an actual need for
smoke control in the Tuck shops.
The request for a recording ma-
chine for the Blue and Gold Tuck

« shop will be presented to admin-

istration authorities as soon as pos-
sible. The question was presented
'r.he SF‘A executive committee

Under the plan, 50 per cent of
the proﬁts received from the op-
eration of the machine will go to
the ﬁrm which installs it. Sup-
porters of ‘the plan expressed the
Belief that the remainder of the
profits could be used to make up

__the loss incurred in various stu-

dent functions.

The question of cigarette smoke
in the Tuck shops was brought to

"the attention of SFA at the first "S

meeting of the year. At that time

‘it was averred that numerous com-
plaints of the amount of smoke

in the Tuck shops had been
brought to the attention of SFA
members.
Smoke

The smoke was said to be ges-
lunch
hours, and, as one member of
SFA expressed it, “Most peo”pl'e
don't like to have cigarette smoke
in their -butter.” The question
was referred to the statistics com-
mittee, under Tom Grogan, BA42,
to determine whether or not stu-
dents are annoyed by the smoke
and whether there is sufficient de-
mand for the restriction.

Ventilation .

In the meantime, William Clem-
mer, C43, was appointed to look
into the possibilities of ventilating

the Tuck shops by mechanical
means in order to remove the
smoke. '

It was believed at that time that
the introduction of a mechanical
device would be preferable to the
restriction of smoking, a measure
which would in all probability be
unpopular With many members of
the (student body.

As yet, no report has been re-
ceived from Clemmer as to the
progress of his investigation.

At the same time, the statistics
committee was instructed to con-.
duct a student pool to determine
the extent of the locker shortage.

Respect for law and order has
fallen to a new low.

It has even come to the point
where Pitt students, football men,
are leaping with all their weight
on passing police cars against the
express orders of the police; and
to add to the confusion are not
only wrecking themselves, but the
police cars.

. Police claim that two Pitt
freshmen football toters hitched
a ride on the running board of
a passing radio car as the police
apparently sat inside powerless
to throw them off.

The youths, William Kurtz,
C45, and Joseph Geraud, C45
were not seriously hurt when
they" supposedly blocked the vi-

 sion of the policemen and caused
the car to crash.

Perhaps they were just trying
out a new Bowser play.

ance, you may apply until Sat

Hospital
Fee Due

. ,
Tomon ow

Final date for payment of the
fee for the student hospitalization
plan is tomorrow, announces Dr.

H. C. Carlson, director of the
Men’s Student Health service.

Urging students to sign up for
the plan before the lastopportu-
nity passes, Dr. Carlson" pointed
out that the student is not pro-
tected until the ﬁrst semester
payment is made. .After tomor-
row, enrollment for the plan will
be closed until next semester.

‘Fee for the ﬁrst semester policy
is $2.50 and is payable at the
Treasurer’s office 2409 Cathedral.

The plan, which is co-sponsored
by the University health service
and the Pitt News, entitles the
student subscriber to hospitaliza-
tion including 21 days \in ward
accommodations, or $3.00 allow-
ance per day toward semiprivate
or private room, use of the oper-
ating room as often as necessary,
anethesia as often as necessary,
ordinary drugs and medications,
necessary dressings and casts,
routine laboratory services, and
ordinary X-rays. ‘

Dr. Auleene W. Jamison, direc-
tor of the women’s student health
service, emphasized Dr. Carlson’s
remarks.

“The sooner the students rec-
ognize the value of such a pro-
gram, the sooner we will be able
to maintain a higher standard of
student health on the campus,"
Dr. Jamison asserted recently.

Blue cards of application may be
obtained in the Treasurer's office
2409 Cathedral.

Zoning . . .

continued from page one

Protective association, with an aim
to not only block the sale of the
house but to “wipe out” all zon-
ing violations in the neighborhood.

If the committee were success-
ful in attempting the latter, it
would affect the Phi Epsilon Pi
house, also located on North Nev-
ille street, in addition to the Phi
Kappa. This would mean that both
fraternities would be forced out of
their present homes.

City Council is scheduled to
meet early next week to pass on
the citizens’ new request.
