I   Resigns Over
‘Self-conflicts’

Last January I was elected as one of 17 Liberal Arts members
of the Student Government Senate, now I must inform you that I am
resigning from that position as of Sept. 25. I am stepping out of my
Senate seat, not in disgust or outrage, but because of pressing per-.
sonal and academic concerns "which are forcing me to cut down on
extracurricular activities. Having given serious consideration to all
my activities, I feel the one which is the least rewarding—personally
and in its service to the University—is the Senate.

Many factors have gone into this decision and as my‘ constitu-
ents you have a right to know how I made mydecision. Compared
to my Mentor group, my membership on the Recognitions Commit-
tee, and my interests in foreign student affairs, /the Senate is not a
personally gratifying experience.

I realize the Senate responsibilities are meaningless.

The theoretical ideal would be for each Senator to be so dedi- 4»
cated to his post that he would take ‘the initiative to stimulate inter-

Lack of open discussion and student involvement are two
major University issues. An ad hoc group of interested Univer-
sity students set up last December to discuss these problems. In-

Plans for the scope of :this,fdis_-,-.s 

Senate illustrates the traditional gap between theory and practice,
and in reality it serves three prime functions. - '

1) It grants established campus names with a new prestigious
title, without requiring sincerity or efforton their part. Withinthis
Senate, as in previous ones,-there is a percentageof Senators who at-
tained their posts—not through campaigning, nor out of a sincere de-
sire to represent your interests. Their names or their factsuwere
well-known before election time. ‘

Don't take this as a generalization, because Roy Jacobs, Jack‘

ed at'Pitt before they sought a Senate post. But they have maintain-
ed their good names and their active service while in the Senate.

Still there are others who have yet to prove themselves as Senators,
or perhaps th'eir lack of activity reflects how well they have per-
ceived the Senate’s importance.

2) It serves as a training school for dedicated dark-horse candi-
dates who are genuinely interested in Pitt’s problems. These stu-
dents felt a need to change Student Government’s approach to Pitt’s
problems, but they lacked previous experience with the Student
Government and the University structure. Now in the-fall term they
are ready to serve you, and they usually prove themselves worthy of
their position. Lynda Cahan and Jim Ross are typical of these Sen-
ators. ‘

3) It rubber stamps approval on projects which are managed

the Committee on the Recognition of StudentiOrganizations.” Dur-
ing the past seven months in office this Senate has not approved a
Recognitions Committee decision—-although that Committee ‘has
met regularly since March and acted upon numerous organizations.
The Senate does, however,.allocate funds to these newly recognized
non-Senate approved, organizations through the judgment of the
Allocations Committee. »

I am certain that this year’s Allocations Committee has been
the best-organized, most-effectively handled branch of Student Gov-
ernment. But the excellence of the committee’s operations fails to
counteract the procedure by which "allocations are approved by th
Senate. - B

The Senate entrusts this Committee to judiciously evaluate all
allocation requests and to‘ decide‘upon the amount of each alloca-
tion. These decisions are then’ presented to the Senate to either ap-
prove or reject, during the spring term when Senators must be gath-
ered together from various parts of the country.

a 1’ project of funds, if the original committee decision is rejected.

Argue as you may, that if Senators were firm they‘ could reject
any recommendation on allocations—but then what happens? Do
you really think Senators will return to Pittsburgh from New York,
Washington, D. C., or Ohio at their own expense for a second sum-
mer meeting? Or if they wait until fall can they afford to threaten

I ask you now——who needs the,Senate?

Not the dark-horse candidates. Those interested in service to

“Sexual intercourse will not be

idea because “there’s a better
chance of the Administration ap-
proving the rest of the social

to exert any real influence.

In January, A r m a n d BeIli’s
campaign disgusted me as a child-
ish farce. In retrospect I think he
had a lot to say, but he chose the
wrong focal point. Don’t abolish
Student Government! We need an
executive head. We need capable
leaders like Ken Schueler to en-
courage student involvement. We
need a body — a‘ President’s Coun-
cil — to assist the president when
there is a need for a representa-
tive student statement. This Coun-
cil should be composed of the
hard—working chairmen and pres-
dents of campus organizations or
their representatives who have
proven themselves worthy to exer-
cise their views in your behalf.
The heads of WPGH, Pitt News,
Alternatives, AWS, MDC — who-
ever you deem, representative
should serve on this Council. Ken
Schueler does not need the Sen-
ate as it now exists.

I say the Senate as it now exists,
because Ken Schueler envisions a
new Senate. This Senate would fit
my theoretical definition in which

each Senator would be responsible _

for speaking regularly at dorms
and fraternities to know how his
constituency feels on campus is-
sues. By directly confronting stu-
dents with the issues the Senate
could guarantee its legitimacy. If
this Senate is dedicated to that vi-
sion also, it might work. In an at-
tempt to view the situation realis-
tically I tend to doubt the chances

_for the success of Ken’s vision.

“Tweed1edum and _Tweedle-
dee.” Which would be your
choice in November?_.Voters in
this year’s election face political
dilemma of choosing between
two mediocre candidates.

“Tweedledum and Tweedle-
dee” was the topic discussed by
Richard Cottam in a noon lecture
in the SU Supper Room on Tues-
day. The title of the lecture is
derived from an analogy Cottam
dr-ew between the twins in Alice
in Wonderland and the two presi-
dential candidates.

Cottam-contends that there are

four serious “problems” in this

years presidential election: Viet-
nam, the crisis in the cities, the
youth rebellion and the populist
revolution. Y

He demanded a reexamination
of Vietnam policies and a reap-
praisal of the whole Southwest
Asia situation. He mentioned the
problem of the crises in our cities
with emphasis on treatment of
the black community. '

'Cottam termed the increasing
youth rebellion, a “r e b e 1 lio n

against depersona1ization,” an at-
tempt _by young people to assert
their individuality.

The fourth serious problem, the
populist revolution served to fur-
ther Wallace’s candidacy, con-
tends Cottam. He feels that the
American public drastically un-
derestimates Wallace’s strength,
and may possibly be surprised in
November.

Cottam then proceeded to offer
solutions to the problems. He stat-

ed that we “need to take to
cliche ‘participitory democracy
and make it into something more‘;
than a cliche. The real answer,’
Cottam contended, “lies in a,

Theoretically Ilaccept his stand,

but pragmatically I do not think .

it could work. It wouldn’t work
because each Senator has an un-

and each Senator has personal
priorities on his time which would
have to be supplanted.

Confusion

There is a huge void at this University. It is not the void
of total disinterest; it is not the void of a quiet secluded Uni-
versity Community. The void that swims endlessly in the deep
gulf of our minds is the emptiness created by stubborn self-
interest. We all want to do our own things; and we couldn’t

I ,. give a damn about anyone else.

_ The University community is a vicious circle. The students
detest the Administration. The Administration thinks the stu-

dents are inherently ignorant. And the students think the Fac-
ulty is generally lazy and complacent. The Administration

worries about the Faculty. And the Faculty worries about

the Administration. All vicious circles are confusing, and such

seas of confusion reinforce the status-quo.

One thing that all of us must realize is that only a few-

? people at this institution believe that the status-quo must be
g_ fmaintained. Even the Administration wants to make somefund-
amentalchanges here at the University. The Faculty is inter-

ested in reforms. And most of the students believe that some

" ‘ fundamental changes are in order. .

All the constituents in this University Community seek
some sort of change. But to use William Lederer’s very poi-
gnant phrase, “We are our own worst enemies.” We fight
amongst ourselves, and we achieve nothing. In this self-
defeating atmosphere, all the members of the University
community are fools. We have so much energy, but all it is
diffused into nothing by our own self-interest.

Why is there such a lack of communication on this cam-
pus? There is lack of communication between the students
and the Administration, between the administration and the
faculty, and between the faculty and the students. Maybe we
just don’t trust each other. Maybe we have closedoff our
minds. Maybe all of us are just plain stupid.

This is the situation today. Perhaps it will change some-

- time in the future. Perhaps it will change ‘because of some en-

ergetic students, faculty and administrators who will learn
the graceful art of compromise. Perhaps things will change
when we learn that our individual ideas might not always be
the “best course of action.” And we will all be much bet-
ter off when we learn that cooperation is far superior to con- .

‘I I ‘ _ frontation.

It is easy to see that this University needs some sort of
open forum where members of the Administration, Faculty,
and Student Body can meet one another, debate issues of con-
cern, and learn to understand why other ‘people think the
way they do. From this base, compromise and change could be
realized. This is the only means to the end of change.

This approach is advocated by two newly formed groups.
Process 68 is attempting to bridge the gulf of faculty - stu-
dent perceptions. The program has gained a great deal of
momentum, and is one sure way of righting some of the wrongs
of this institution. The other scheduled program geared to

 : enhance better understanding and cooperation at the Univer-

sity is the Speak Your “Peace” Conference. The conference
will discuss all the relevent issues concerned with student in-

’ volvement.

These programs will not bring on drastic new changes,
but will begin the process of cooperation and understanding
that can only be beneficial to the concept of institutional
change. Any student who is annoyed or who wants to help
improve this university should participate in the weekly sem-
inars of Process 68 or the “Speak Your “Peace” Conference
scheduled for October 12.

In this complex institution the only road to change is the

fl ; one following the path of cooperation and understanding.

Raze South Oakland People;
  We’ll All Live In Pup Tents

   
 

' by IVAN ABRAMS
Contributing Editor

According to a KDKA-TV in-
terview with University Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar, the Univer-
sity is planning to expand the Oak-
land campus to a student popula-
tion of 30,000 students within
the next ten years. In light of.
the existing housing conditions
both on campus and in the sur-
rounding Oakland area, conditions
are insufficient to adequately
house the approximately 7,000
resident students. One can only
suppose that the University will
raze Oakland and erect tents.
Hopefully, of course, the adminis-
tration will follow another course.

This past summer, over 200 apar-

-tments were renovated by their

owners; in the course of the ren-
ovation rents were raised from an
average of $100 per month for a
two bedroom apartment to a min-
imum of $215 for the same unit.
Considering that the landlord has
invested $1500 or so in the re-
habilitation of one apartment,
and more than doubled the rent, he
should reap a tidy profit; in fact,
he should make his investment up
in only 15 months. This isn’t a bad
game for a landlord, but what of
the student who can’t afford these

rents, or doesn’t want to live with
a herd of people?

He has few’choices. Perhaps he
can find a “cheap” apartment,
such as the basement at 236 Oak-
land Avenue which was condemn-
ed last year while being occupied
by a student. Or possibly he can
move to East Liberty or Squirrel
Hill, if he has a car or is willing
to endure the most curious form
of public transportation with
which Pittsburgh is blessed.

Last’ year, the University,
through the offices of the Dean
of Men and the Dean of Women,
conducted a survey of student
apartments in the Oakland area.
The surveyors were accompanied
by the~Oakland chief of the Al-
legheny County Health De-
partment, the current president
of the commuter association, and
this writer. I haven’t seen the re-
sults of the survey, if thay have
ever been released, and neither
have I seen any action from the
administration. But I did see the
apartments. They were so foul that
out of the six we visited, the in-
spector for the Health Depart-
ment wanted to condemn three.

Staff News Editor

Many letters have reached this office this year,
and although many of them were in opposition to
“the way I see it,” they were all printed. One_I re-
ceived yesterday, however, was so well-received that
I felt it deserved to be printed in the space usual-
«ly occupied by my column. The letter follows:

Dear Mr. Tiernan,

WE THOUGHT you would be interested to
know that there is still some school spirit here at Pitt;
After reading your article on Wednesday about fair-
weather football fans, we agreed that the main pro-
blem is that those of us who support the school don’t
receive enough publicity. For instance, our exhibi-
tion of school spirit Wednesday night will be ap-
‘ preciated by only a few Pitt students, for the only
ones who will see our work will be those West Vir-
ginia students, players, coaches and alumni who
travel along routes 51 and 119 to Pittsburgh Satur-
day, and those WVU students who have to cross the
parking lot next to the football field on their cam-
pus. Those people will see someone "at Pitt has

spirit.

our little trip to WVU, andour well planned scheme
to paint pro-Pitt signs on the WVU campus and along

   
  

AEditor,The Pitt Miws;

It is 4 a.m. Sunday morning
and it seems like an absurd time
to be writing a letter to the edi-
tor. However, I wish to convey
myfeeling of depression and anger
that I feel at this moment. I
have been a loyal fan to the Pitt
Football team since my freshman
year, Two years ago. I never gave
up hope that we were building and
working toward national promin-
ence. Last night my dream came
true.

Pitt was beaten by UCLA 63-7
and we gained national promin-
ence; prominence as one of the
worst teams in the country. I
have been optimistically await-

A ing this game for six months, and

bragging, to my friends that our

  
 

, aren’t being - built. Will

has termed “sheep dip.”

But again, what of the Univer-
sity? They have not acted upon
facts of which they are well a-
ware. The dorms in the Cemetery
there
be new dorms elsewhere? At
other schools, from Earlham in
Indiana to the University of Mich-
igan, apartment buildings and-
or houses have been bought, built,
and renovated by administration

   
  
  
  
  
   
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
  
    
  
   
 
   
  
 
   
   
 
    

action not possible for our Univer-
sity? It would make much more
sense for the administration to
provide dwellings before the hous-
ing crisis becomes more critical
than to procrastinate any longer.
But to date they have been con-
spicuously silent.

Student Power is the phrase
of the month and I think I can
safely presume that any suc-
cessful Student Power move-
ment will involve the untold
masses of previous apathetic
students. Perhaps, then, these mas-
ses can convince the administra-
tion that housing in Oakland is
rotten. Perhaps a rent strike is the
answer. Then, when the strikers
are all evicted, the University
might feel morally compelled
to act. But, then again, it just might
tear down Oakland and raise some
tents. '

But the reason I am writing this is not to brag of
our accomplishment, but to inform the readers if‘

you can run this in the paper of what great fun it
was for the seven of us to rally to the aid of our
school. On the return trip, we would break intoun-
controllable laughter as we envisioned the WVU
students waking to see “Go Pitt, Pitt In ’68” painted
in large letters on their campus parkinglot.

We were in stiches as weimagined the foot-

well played game against UCLA
was assured. When I came back
to school three weeks ago all I
could talk about was how we were
going to beat the,Uclans.

After all, we had two men on
defense who were probable all-
Americans. a quarterback who
could scramble, and most of all
team spirit. Well, at least that is
what everyone was saying.

When the Bruins scored the first
time they had the ball, .most of the
people I was with walked away
from the radio in disgust.. But
not me. No, I felt this was an im-
proved team; That we had a good
chance.‘ Maybe I should have
left with the others. Eight touch-
downs! We lost by_eight touch-

ball players crossing the state line to be welcomed by
the sign, “Welcome To Pennsylvania” with “Home

MANY OF US remembered the aggravating
“WVU” inscriptions of the stadium and cathedral
walls last year, and we thought we would remind
our southern neighbors that we at Pitt still “Care
enough to send the very best.”

In closing, we ask that this letter be printed
unsigned, as we do not wish to be exposed to the
opposing forces. This letter, however, will not self-
destruct in five seconds.

would have been shut-out Is this

have been led to believe was im-

I don’t know what the hell I
am doing up at 4:30 writing this '
letter. Maybe its because I want
something for those six months
that _I spent making a fool of my-
self. Never again. Oh, I’ll be at all

 George C. Wallace, the man from Alabama,
has darkened‘ the 1968 Presidential year with
his] shadow. He has come through to reach
people like aloudspeaker in a library. He has
voice and he hasvolume. And he has instilled
an exciting-definiteness. in many voters.

AFTER RICHARD -NIXON was “united-
ly” nominated.in early August, many Americans
(good-citizens) were turned-off. They said little,
but they did say theywould wait until late Aug-
ust for Senator Eugene McCarthy. Then Vice-Pres-
ident-Hubert -Humphrey -was"‘divisively” nomin-
ated; I _ A

“What choicedo wehave,”. said—Ernie Hoffman,

Wallace.” ~

,“Some of presidential candidate George C. Wal-
lace’s key supporters in at least 34 states are mem-
bers of extreme Right-wing organizations, includ-
ing serveral of the nation’s most virulent racist and
anti-Semitic groups,” reports Jack Nelson and Nich-

geles Times. T -

pledged electors,” reports the Times’ correspon-
dents intheir findings, based on studies made by
four groups which monitor Right-wing activities-F
(Institute for American Democracy‘, Anti-Defama-

on Political Ethics, and Group Research, ‘Inc. ).

But "Ernie is‘ not a-Right-wing extremist; he’s a
family man. His comments represents the viewsof
many voters who feel there is no ‘choice between
Nixon and Humphrey, and are going to register. a
dissent vote for Wallace in November. ’ '

' Ernie is one of _a core. of persons, _26 to 35 years
of age. They’re the ones who missed out on ama-
jor American war; But still, they were theones who
as kids saw their families struggle during World.

extremist support from the Birch society and has
done little to discourage it from the more violent

billed an an “un-party,” a “freak

President Johnson was feted with
songs like “Master of Hate,” and
a special salute from Realist pub-
lisher Paul Krassner. He told a
story of a newsman asking the
President how he justified the

LBJ supposedly replied by say-

Dave Dellinger, who as head of

Special to The Pitt Neics

It has taken a tremendous amount of energy just to absorb
the extent of the injustices that were committed in Chicago

' in the name of “law and order.” I have no real inclination to tell
. the following story in all its gory detail, but I think it should be

offered as an antidote to the tendentious and ‘nar_row—mind-
ed approach adopted by the local commercial media. From the-

very beginning Mayor Daley had done everything possible, both .

by word and action-, to let it be known that neither the Yippies nor
the Mobilization were welcome in Chicago, and that their very presence
would be sufficient cause for police violence against _them. His shoot
to kill statement subsequent to the April uprising was interpreted

On April‘ 27, Daley sent his

' club-swinging police into a peac-

ful-group of anti—war protestors
in the plaza of the newly-built
Civic Center. And of course he
refused to issue permits, either
to. march or to peacefully occupy.
the parks, both to the Yippies
and to the Mobilization and in fact
answered their persistent applica-
tions with the announcement of a
new park curfew. (This is not quite
true: the city had issued a per-
mit to demonstrate inGrant Park,
ironically enough, from 1 to 4
p.m. Wednesday, the very time
the police lost complete control
of the situation. and began their

blood riot against the people);

I understand that the Shriners
have little difficulty in obtain-

inggrnarch permits,’and manage

to completely snarl traffic when

Qgthey stage their massive marches
. through‘ the Loop. «Potential de-

monstrators clearly recognized‘

these threats.

THE‘ HEADLINE of one ‘pre-
convention underground news-

‘ by, many as a direct threat to future demonstrators. ‘ .

paper, for example," reads: “If
you’re going to Chicage, be sure
to wear some armour in your hair.”

‘San Francisco Express Times,

Aug. 21, 1968) Another, The
Berkely Barb, quoted a local Yip-

pie as saying: “Go to Chicage if r

you are together, if you feel that
theexpression of alternative life
style and radical political solidarity
is crucial in Chicago, and If you
are committed enough to Suffer
for It.” (Aug. 23-29, p. 3) There
can be little doubt that Daley’s

tactics of intimidation succeeded’ .

in scaring tens of thousands
of potential demonstrators from
coming to Chicago.

I arrived at Lincoln Park for
the first time just before dusk
Monday. Ilearned that the cops

had stolen Pigasusto prevent his. ‘

nomination for President by the
Yippies and to take the fire out

.of their challenge to the Demo-

crats to produce a better candidate
than Pigasus and a better plat-
form than his garbage. I also dis-
covered that the cops had clear-.

  oats st

 

ed the park the night before ‘with-
out much resistance, The scene.

was a very placid one and actual- '

ly resembled a convention in
many ways. People from all over
the country had come together
to talk about the inevitability of
socialism, the crying need for so-
cial justice and black power,
andqthe repressive inertia of es-
tablished institutions everywhere.
By 12:30, however, the cops had
decided to implement their_boss’s
policy that freedom of assembly
is a right guaranteed only to those
of orthodox opinions; and I heard
over their loud speaker: “This is
the last (sic) warning. You are
disobeying the curfew order and
we will take whatever action is
necessary to drive you from the
park” or something like that.

WHEN THE gas came I ‘be-!
gan to retreat slowly. I saw a
"cop head for a camera-clad man

   

._».

  

trying to blend in -with the scenery

by standing up against a tree.
As the cop’s intention became evi-
dent, he protested loudly that he
was press. Little good it did him-
as the cop began swinging. It will
be remembered that this was the
first night that newsmen were at-
tacked and injured-. The single-
mindedness with which that cop
approached newsman suggests to"
me that there was little doubtin
his mind abouthis orders with
respect to'newsmen. ‘I was sud-
denly diverted from this fine spect-
acle by the aspect of my own in-
dividual tormentor who, when I
asked him. rather derisively if he
intended to shoot, he began clubbing
me with the butt of his gun. I fell
to the ground and tried to protect
my head as two ‘of his col-
‘leagues joined in the merriment.

« The Nixon strategy in Miami outside
the convention hall was obvious: “Make
them think no one else exists.’..’ To convince
those..in Miami, and particularly the dele-
gates and _ other convention goers, that
“N ixonfs the One,_” the Nixon headquarters
deluged the city with posters; walking bill-
boards in the form of very attractive young
women; the Nixon Navy, a fleet of boats
for the use of delegates and alternates,
through the inland water ways of Miami

Beach; "balloons, bumper stickers and but- -

tons oneverything from cars to helicopters
and girls to elephants. One two thousand
pound bundle of happiness and, Nixon
war paraded through the Hilton, hotel

painted inpink with'a sign that read, “Ana _

say’s Nixon-’s the One.” - .. .

THE FACT that the elephant was pink
had nothing to do with communists or a

'wh.istful hallucination by the Nixon team.

In fact the*Nixon team overlooked nothing‘
in their attempt to-clinch-the nomination.
And money was no obstacle either. The
parties which served as many as a thousand
at one throw probably exceeded by f-ar, the
total funds spent by. the other candida-
tes in their Miami search for delegates.

The delegates were smart, and they be- ' ,
. -lieved in the two party system; two parties
‘ every night. Even if they decided which

way their vote was to go they played it

cool to receive the red carpet treatment from

every candidate in town, -and there were

many. Some played it so cool" that even if '

they had no intention of voting for Nixon

, they wound up doing so. 'A couple of high
~- balls and conversation with a lovely young’
. thing at one of those parties. was enough to

sway some delegates, expecially if the ride
home was in an air—conditioned chauffer
d_riven Nixon hospitality car. “So what’s
one more vote? That party was great.”

THE PARTY wasn’t so great to some
of those"‘lovely young things” in a whirl-
wind of sudden big time politics who very
often got in unlovely trouble when they
found themselves alone with a fun loving
delegate separated from the rest of the
world by a locked hotel room door. “Oh I’m
sorry, the caucus must be over, I guess
you’ll have to talk to them some other
time.” In the mean ‘time they were forced

to prepare an impromptu speech on the vir-

tues of the fair sex,gan,d why. they -should .

, ._ .
u  >; -4. ’

 

Never-the-less the convention was de-
luged by Nixon.  '

Sure Rockefelller and Regan‘ couldn’t
hold back the Nixon railroad, in fact they
lost ground despite the big play they got in
the papers. Even Stassen, Case, Rhodes,
Romney, Hatfield and others tried to no
avail. Besides the perfection of the Nixon
maintenance crew, the delegates were in-
terested in being on the winning side and
cast their votes for the‘ biggest party in
town, i which turned into the Nixon, band
wagon express. * 2 '

The other nine favorite. son candidates,

including more than favorite son Romney,
kindly resumedtheir normal places after‘

the balloting since the televised proceed-

ings let it be know to the folks back home _
that their boy was on the ball. To be sure, ’

their “dead serious” nominations were
only intended to be free
cements. 

‘On the other handfthe Nixon express"

wasn’t the only train; a few were derailed.

A ADISMAL Winthrop Rockefeller sway-f
‘ed back, and forth with a drink in one hand,

fighting the tears swelling in his eyes, as ,

he stood in front of his_moonlit hotel po__ol
close to three o'clock the night of the con-
vention. “Nelson is such a good man.” he
said nostalgically to whoever would listen,
recalling the sudden, hard and desperate
campaign of his brother-from New York.
“~He’s sucha good man.”

A Across town there were other reactions.
Nixon had a victory party and Regan was
smiling. The Republican convention of
1968 brought the party -togetherafter its
cataclismic schism in 1964, and they were
ready to win. With Nixon. A

All told, the convention was another
“games people play” a la, the put-on.
“See, America’  . . ..Nixon really is the
one.” Despite the spontaneous and im-
mediate image the party tried to create and
send to the-American public via Media,

with love, it wasn’t so at all.’ Yes every-

one may think that the demonstrations are

planned, certainly they .have been told.
‘But how many people realize the delegates

‘Mobe’ Tactic:

You Must Take
These Flowers

by TOM MILLER
College Press Service

, -’CHICA,GO—Late in the afternoon the day of the Battle of

‘Michigan Avenue, Dave Dellinger of the National Mobiliza-

tion Committee huddled with two representatives of the Chicago

-Police Department. He- was explaining to them what tactics

the ‘-‘Mobe” was planning to use next and why, while the of-
ficers kept repeating, “This is not time for philosophizing.” In
the crush of people surrounding the summit conference, poet
Allen Ginsberg, his voice hoarse from chanting and speaking,
waved some ﬂowers directly in the face of one officer, saying
with an intense look in his face, “You must take these flowers,
it’s most important that you take these ﬂowers. You don’t un-
derstand how important it is that you take these ﬂowers.”
The officer silently refused.

SOMEHOW ' THAT Dellinger-police meeting symbolized
the whole week. There was the refusal of the police to recog-

- ‘ nize individuals, even in their most absurd conditions, the in-
 tense offer of reconciliation on the part of the Movement, a to-
 tal lack of understanding of what the protest was or why it.
-"existed, And from that week, the Movement will go off on its
i own.

The radical political and cultural groups—best known being
Students for a Democratic Society and various guerrilla theatre
troupes—~ which solidified and grew from last October’s Penta-
gon march to Lyndon Johnson’s withdrawal _— now have their
best recruitment opportunities. In these. last 18. months, move-
ment groups have been forced to parellel practical established
politics. Alternatives to McCarthy and Kennedy work had to

compete with the game of “system politics.” Radical groups i

planned their activities as responses to calculated moves by
Johnson, Humphrey, Daley, while carefully avoiding mention

I‘ of Kennedy or McCarthy.

NOW, THROUGH the death of volunteeractivitv on behalf
of Presidential candidates, radical organizations no longer need
to calculate moves by regular politics, and. can -now veer off on
.its own course. In the aftermath of the Battle of Michigan Av-
enue, it has gained momentum and numbers. It has even gained
‘legitimacy.

When the turf in Grant Park facing the Conrad Hilton was

" won Wednesday and Thursday evenings, thousands of people

gathered to hear the speeches and music throughout the night.
The audience participated in any way they saw fit; extending
the Digger concept of “Free City,” this was a Free Convention

, —anyone could take the microphone and say what he pleased.

More significant than the speeches was the mood of the
crowd. This was not a radical anti-administration harangue.

I What evolved was a feeling much like that of the civil rights

movement in the South in the early Sixties—one of solidarity,
"camaraderie and a strange kind of patriotism. The religious fer-
_vor of the righteous civil rights movement had taken hold of this
"odd assortment of students, clergy, professors, suburbanites
and blacks.

-» ONCE THE FREE Convention was under way, it gained
istature. Not only regular radical political spokesmen and their
[cultural counterparts speak; the delegates also came over to

'» speak. From the South came a delegate from South Carolina, who

toldthe crowd that while he was a “law and order” man and
‘voted for Humphrey, he had never seen such action on the part

of police, had never known what the peace people were.really .

like, and had now come away with new thoughts on “Law and
order” and sympathetic feelings for the anti-war movement.”

The obvious fact is that McCarthy workers had nowhere
to go at that time. For some the defeat of their man was in-
stant radicalization, for others only a temporary flirtation
with the radical movement. For those there will be Congres-
sional candidates to work for. The campaigns of Lowenstein on
Long Island, Meer in suburban Maryland-near Washington,
Gilligan in Ohio, and Swan in Kansas willzbe staffed by McCar-
thy volunteers. Yet for one‘ week "the Movement swelled, the un-
derground showed its face to the country, and the country for
once did not disapprove.

ALL AT ONCE the reams of radical literature distriibuted
during those four days made sense. Even the biggest put-on
of a1l—the Yippies——fit in. (The Yippie cult is itself one of the
year’s stranger phenomena. While most cults, personality or
ideological, grow from reality to myth (Che Guevara or the
Kennedy brothers) the Yippie, movement has come from myth

 to reality.) Material on SDS, Socialist Workers Party, Progres-

sive Labor and Trotsykites was accepted with the same toler-
ance asthe free daily newspapers put out during the week.

People would turn to the Ramparts Wall Poster for their
news instead of the Chicago Tribune. (Andwell they might
-"have — Ramparts, despite its editorial squabbles, scooped the
commercial dailies on President Johnson’s staff quartered on the
2.-21st floor of the Hilton, Texas refusing riot control duty, and

get into the back seat, when the
barrel of a rifle was shoved into
my stomach with considerable
force. I was~a little psyched out
by this time and don’t remember
what the rifleman said, but his
tone of voice didn’t seem too
friendly. They finally managed to
maneuver me into the car.

Just as I entered, head first, . I

I was smashed in the face by one
of the occupants, presumable
with a club judging from the force
of» the blow. I must have appeared
a terrible threat to them, hands
handcuffed behind my back, for
they were still anxious to subdue
me. When we got to the 18th
Precinct Station, the cops got out
and opened the back doors (another
young man had been picked up
a couple of minutes before me.
One cop pulled me out of the seat
by my hair and smashed my face
down on his knee. The second
cop threw my partner up against
the wall, and we were both push-
ed into the station. '

THE FIRST. .thing I heard
when we entered the station was
said by a cop sitting behind a desk-:,
“Somebody’s going to die tonight
We were asked to empty our pock-
ets. When I took a paperback
book about Vietnam out of my
pocket and put it on the table, I
was asked pettily: “What do you
know about Vietnam?” I pre-.
sume the question was rhetorical;
at any rate, what I had already
seen and been through indicated
that attempting to answer would
be tantamount to taking my life
in my hands..

My friend-, Ron, wasn’t’_ fast
enough, ,so part of his shirt was
ripped off. One cop said to another
that they were going to get “heavy
weapons,” and was answered that
the trouble with that was, they
don’t always let you use them.
Then one of the cops took Ron
into a back room, for the purpose
of beating him, Ron later told me.
Fortunately the cop was a rookie
and hadn’t yet been weaned
from every last humanitarian
scruple his mother had planted in
his mind as a child. Ron had a
chance to talk before the guy
really started-laying it on, and
finally covinced him that there
was at least a genuine doubt that
he was guilty (he was walking
down the sidewalk with his girl-

friend when he was set upon by
the cops who accused him of throw-
ing rocks at a police car.)

 

DEAN RUSK
Platform hearings

IT’S CERTAINLY a strange
twist on the Fifth Amendment,
accordingto which alleged viola-
tors of the law are not to be held
responsible for their “crime” un-
less duly convicted, that a person
has to convince a policeman that he
may be innocent inlorder not to get
the shit kicked out of him. As I
was being fingerprinted, one cop
began to complain that none of this
would have happened if it weren’t
for “civil rights.” I presume he
was referring to the recent Su-
preme Court decisions assailed
so vigorously by Wallace and,
yes, Nixon (remember that fine
acceptance speech?) .,

Then’ they brought in a tall
lanky man who had been arrested,
‘as ‘far as I could determine, for.

carrying a red ﬂag in'the park
(anti-Communist paranoiacs,

note well: the red flag has,his-
torically been the banner of the
radical left; it was co-opted by
the Bolsheviks in 1917, but’ does-

‘not belong to them.) He too was

harrassed but he tried to rap with
one of his tormentors. He told
him that he had absolutely nothing
against him as"a person, that his
enemy was the social system and
there was no needto use exces-
sive force because he was coopera-
ting.

It was really amazing; I expect-
ed his brains to be bashed out
mercilessly on the spot. But the
cop was actually listening; he
said “Put your hands at your side,
please . . . see, I said please.”
The guy thanked him and they
went on like that for a little
while. Then the sergeant came in.
He was incensed that anyone had
dared display the red flag; though

. it was evident that he didn’t.know

what it stands for;=i(_,Dor_i=’;t forget,
in» this connection, that —t;he;_:,rne,n“

who first _ cari;i1ed__ the §tai_'s_,_., and-.=
Stripes were jracical ‘leftist re-,

 

 

volutionaries who demanded a sub-
stantive restructuring of political
society and were willing to take

to the streets, -if necessary, to ef-
fect it. (The sergeant completely
blew his cool" when he found out
that the man was a college physics
teacher‘. ,

, HE STARTED screaming things
about the “Communist Conspira-
cy” that is seducing the young in-
nocents of our country from The
Truth (as enunciated by Johnson,
Humphrey, Daley, Abrams, and
crew, I suppose). The level of vio-
lence began to rise throughout
the station as this catalyst was in-
troduced. Things had been cool-
ing off, but now we were pushed,
manhandled, and yelled at again.
This little story illustrates one of
the serious institutional defects of
the police system in this country;
namely, that there is .a strong in-
stitutionally-sanctioned peer
group pressure to be brutal and
‘cruel to those seen as dangerous
to “the establishment,” expecial-.
ly that segment with which the
police are concerned. This is some-
thing that white, middle class, pro-
pertied people find hard to un-
derstand; for to them the police
appear as protectors and friends.

THESE POINTS of vieware, 

‘not contradictory, of course. The

cops honestly see themselves as "
protectors of the white bourgeoisie-,

the backbone of ths_ system they

are trying to defend. Even a white i

bourgeois" with radical ideas has
recourse to’ his whiteness and to
the influence of money and pro-'
perty. The black and powerless,
however, haven’t these “advanta-
ges’ and are subject to the full
force of police and court perse-
cution. .
(Editor’s note: Michael Ber-
-trand, a University senior math-_

«ematics major, was in Chicage

during the Democratic conven-
tion, August 26-30.

He went there on his own to
demonstrate against the war.
He went also in support of the
minority peace plank.

Here in the first of a two in-
stallments, Bertrand tells his
story.)

Dreams Could Decide
Grid Victor Tomorrow

by Roy Jacobs
Sports Editor

     

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The Mountaineers of West
Virginia invade Pitt Stadium
Saturday as 4-point favorites, de-
spite a shaky offense.

In "the third year of Coach
Jim Carlen’s rebuilding pro-
gram, WVU will be bank-
ing on an all sophomore back-
field.

Tom Digon and Garland Hud-
son completed 58 per cent of
their passes in sharing the signal-
calling duties last year, but Mike
Sherwood’s spring performance
earned the sophomore quarter-
back a starting berth. In WVU’s
17- game victory,
last week, Sherwood completed
13 of 22 passes for 195 yards
and a touch down.

    
  

   
   
       
   
   
   

   
  
   
  
   
  
  
  
   
    
  
   
   
  
   
  
   
   
     
   
   
   
 
   
 
  
   
 

_ '-Either one of two football games will be played in Pitt Sta-
tdium tomorrow. Which one it is depends largely on which one the
"Panthers play in their minds tonight.

One geme could be a replay of last year when the Mountain-
eers pushed the Panthers up and down the field, although they
didn’t score a touchdown in winning 15-0. It could be worse this

 ’ IT COULD BE worst if the Panthers don’t
' believe — or only half heartedly believe-in
" themselves. If they allow themselves to make
 mental errors, or talk themselves into believ-
-   ing that West Virginia is better, or don’t real-
»’   ly care about winning, it could be a lot worse
‘ " than last year. ‘

    But there’s a good chance that there’ll be

‘ ' '  ._- a different game tomorrow. There s no reason

Why there shouldn’t be. On paper, the Pan-
thers should be clear favorites.

But the Mountaineers displayed
a miserable rushing attack against
winless Richmond (0-2). In 48
running . plays, West Virginia

    

rushing average.

Tailback Bob Gresham, flan-
ker Wayne Porter, and fullback
Jim Braxton complete the all-
sophomore backfield, a back-
field that was shutout by last
year’s Panther Cubs.

 

rider;

_ ‘ 1 Evaluate the personnel. Go position by position and you have
to feelthe Panthers have more talent. Remember, the last two
years the Panther Cubs .—— without a real good freshman pro-
lgram—have beaten the West Virginia freshmen. Last year, the
Little‘Mountaineer backfield-now the WVU starting backfield ’
‘cou1dn’t score a touchdown.

LOOK AT the_one-game statistics for the two teams. They
are fairly similar. Then consider whom each team was ‘playing.
Granted, West Virginia may have been looking past_ Richmond
towards Pitt; but the Panthers were playing the fifth-ranked
team in the country.

But few~games are won on paper. There’s another.factor that
needs to be considered—pressure. Pressure on the Players, the
coaches, on Dave Hart. Maybe they’re pressures that shouldn’t
be there so early in the season; but people have been promised
a lot, and so the pressure has been increased in the wake of the
_63-7. debacle.

Last week the pressure was on the sophomores. They were
reminded they were‘ sophomores so often and they were so con-
vinced that they would make sophomore mistakes that in the
game they were consciously trying to avoid making mistakes, and
this caution hurt their game. This week, the pressure’s on
the whole team. - ‘
-THE PANTHERS WERE an embarassed lot early in the
week. They came home from Los Angeles Sunday and more or
less hid in their rooms. But as Dave Hart said, “If you don’t
have shame, you don’t have pride.” ‘The coaches have tried to
rebuild the pride all week. For pride and confidence will de-
termine tomorrow’s outcome; '

And if the Panthers are going to win tomorrow, it’ll have to
be almost entirely on their own. There’s no pep rally today totry
and drag some school spirit out of the students. Dave Hart
didn’t want that and neither, probably, did the team.

So, any truly interested students that wish to display their
support for the team or the coach have to make a ‘little extra
effort. The only chance left to see the team before the game tom-
orrow would be to go up to their final practice today at Pitt
Stadium and offer some encouragement and backing.

1 .Just don’t think that yelling tomorrow at the game is going
to boost them past West Virginia. Silly as it may seem, what
the squad thinks after practice today and what they dream about
tonight will determine who‘wins tomorrow. ‘

   
     

5 remains WVU’s only proven of-
. fensive threat. Last year, Jusk-
ﬁowich kicked five field goals
 to drop the Panthers, 15-0, at
 Mountaineer Field. '

But West Virginia fields a
 strong, experienced. defense.
 Last year, the Mountaineers al-
 lowed their opponents less than
 12 points ‘per game. And after
 one game this year, the Gold and
' Bluegdefense has yet to give up
any points." , \

The defense is lead by senior

LAST YEAR, the Mountaineers couldn't score a touchdown on the Pan-

thers despite coming close, while winning 15-0. Still,. the defensive line

play needs to be much improved over the UCLA game, if WVU is going’

to be stopped this year.

if Rugged Away Meet Presents

Substantial Testfor Harriers

by BILL NAAB»

Saturday not only will be a day of reckoning for the Pan-
ther football team, but it will also be an important day for coach
Jin Banner’s cross-country squad. After winning last ‘week, the har-
riers face a very strong Bowling Green team and a stable Buffalo
State squad at Buffalo.

“Bowling Green is very tough, one of the best teams in the Mid-

America Conference,” B a n n e r
warned. The outstanding member
of the Bowling Green squad is Sid
Sink.

“He’s"a very good distance run-
ner,” said Banner. Considering the
fact that Jerry Richey will be op-
posing Bowling Green’s Sink, Ban-
ner forecasted a rugged r a c e
ahead.

The coach also indicated that
Buffalo State is a well balanced
teams “They’ve got a pretty fair
team. Buffalo’s the usual winner
of the Western New York State
Conference,” Banner remarked.

Paul “Benito” Stoller is
treading on thin ice, or rather,
thin air. The editor-in-chief of
the Pitt News has once again put

his protruding nose where it does-
n’t belong. '

“How can you bet on Air
Force?” asked George “Mousta-
chio” Lies in amazement. “Have
you been drafted or something?”

Benito’s pick of Air Force is
like playing Wilt Chamberlain
one-on-one. But then again, ;Beni;
to has been pretty jumpy lately.

“I’ve g o t to win somehow,”
cried the dictator in despair, “but
how?” I

Whether he knows it or not,
Benito has alternatives.

“Take it easy, Benito. You’re
getting publicity,” said Jerry
“LeRoy” G r u_ e b e l soothingly,
“Did you see what they said
about you in Alternatives?”

Second-place Benito is full of a

 lot of things, but. not winning

 
 

picks.

“Don’t tell me I’m only 10-5,”
screamed Roy “Jumpshot“ Jacobs
at Benito, “You didn’t even beat
my fiancee (who picked for the
girls) last week, and you’re only
ahead of me by one game. I’ve
been spotting you," that’s all.”

Meanwhile, Art “Bubba” Ros- A

engarten «remained silent. He fig-
ured he was ahead of the game;
nobody mentioned his ridiculous
Georgia Teck pick.

In addition, the Buffalo course
is almost flat and has very few
hills. Banner believes that the
away course will be a disadvan-
tage. “Once we’re used to running
hills, it’s difficult running on a
flat course. It’s a different type
of running, more of a speed race,”
commented Banner.

He also stated that the warm,
humid weather has made practice
somewhat difficult for his run-
ners. ‘Nevertheless, Banner said,
“We’re working on bringing down
the time gap between our first and
fifth man.”

Meanwhile, Mark Vornhagen,
who didn’t run last week, will be
back in action Saturday at Buf-
falo. “The injury hurt his condi-
tioning a little, but he’s a good-
competitor,” said Banner.

In an elimination run, John Aik-

sixth and seventh spots on the trav-

eling squad. Matajasic now is run-
ning well, although he had been
sick. The distancemen will need
their presence in order to fight off
their well balanced opponents and
also to prove that they really do
have a great squad.

As for the freshmen, a duplica-
tion of last week’s victory will be
more difficult still. “Buffalo’s
freshmen are pretty good,” Ban-
ner said.

In addition, freshman star Bob

_ Hagner is definitely out of action.

“An old back injury recurred this
week in practice,” commented the
coach. Also, according to Banner,
Neil Sapinza is a question mark
this Saturday.

Banner stated that the freshmen
will not definitely be weaker with-
out Hagner. He exclaimed, “They
always try hard.”

Booters Try for Upset

by ED CONLEY

Coach Leo Bemis is still trying. Trying to beat West Chest-I 

er, that is.

His varsity soccer clubs have battled this team eight times 

in their rivalry and have yet to come up with a win.

Bemis says, “They had to tie us twice, though, once when they
went to the NCAA.”

The two squads of hooters meet tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m-...

at the Fox Chapel High School A

Field in the Pitt home opener,
and it’s going to be very difficult
.for the Panthers to break the vic-
tory line.

“They’ll bring their usual ag-
gressive team. They have good
speed and good size this year.
And, they won’t give you an
inch,” the mentor relates.

The kickers know that this is
going to be one of their toughest
games, and they find it coming
after a hard defeat to Bucknell
in their opener.

Captain Len Harmon states, “I
wish that West Chester came first

and then Bucknell. Then, a loss’

wouldn’t' hurt as much.”

West Chester will be opening
their fall campaign tomorrow, but
Bemis has some idea of what they
could do, anyway.

“They beat their alumni, 3-2.
That shows they’re good, because
their alumni usually have about
25 ex-All Americans in the line-
up,” Bemis says.

In stressing the idea of how
tough West Chester can be, Be-
mis adds, “They have five sophs

starting and they must be good. ’

They put upperclassmen on the
benchf’

Another indication of the
strengthof this team is the fact
A that of their 30-man roster only 18
are making the trip. “I wish we
were good enough to do that,”
the Pitt coach mentions.

As for his team, Bemis sees

some improvement over last week.

"1 think we’ll get the ball down ' 1
on the wings faster this week,” 
he says. This was one of the ma-' I» ‘

jor problems in ‘the loss to Buck-
nell.

Another problem the team has
worked on this week is shooting.
If anything, they have had enough
shots-at goal to be familiar with
the practice. 7

However, one of the team’s best 

shooters, Conference Lekoma,' is

nursing a leg injury suffered~in A 
the opener and just how much ac-. ,_ '
tion he’ll see tomorrow is ques— '

tionable.

The rest of last week’s injured.
appear ready toigo. Norm Roux,‘

in particular, has performed ex-‘ A A
ceptionally well in the past fewaf ‘_,

scrimmages.

But, the squad does seem to be: 7
the underdog this week. To their . 
coach this could be what they 

need. He states, “If ever they had-

the incentive to upset, it’s now.” . ~

; That pre-season form was one of
 recklessness, and aggressiveness.
 f items were conspiculously
* missing last week. “The boys were
;-‘afraid to make a mistake,” ex-
L-—*"pla'ine_d Hart, “ and when they did
._‘make one,- they became overly
.5 cautious after that.

« .,-,4-j.“,This week we have been try-g
 ‘ i_n'g ‘to’ make them reckless‘ and
' .;hoping that they'll turn it loose,”

‘  '- '~l.e_ven more in this week’s practices’.
‘ —.;‘‘The boys who performed well

P7  One of those whom Hart counts ,

'’".'’‘‘/a“, great deal on is fullback Jeff
 "Brown. Brown, who according to

who averaged four yards a carry
in six tries against] UCLA,~ is a
question mark because of a shoul-

der injury which limited him last.

week. Garnett is just coming off

the injuried list and hasn’t really
’ tested his leg yet. Lewis has prac-
ticed at tailback in addition to his

regular wingback post. -

Defensively, the Panthers had a

great deal of re-evaluating to do. .

“All the mistakes that we made

are correctable,” stated defen- ~

sive backfield coach Bill Lewis.
“Instead of adding something for
West Virginia, we have eliminated
things from our defenses and have
gone back to basic.defenses and
stunts. Execution is the key.‘

“It wasn’t what UCLA did to.

us, but what we were doing to

ourselves,” he continued. “We

just didn’t hit,” chimed in defen-
sive head coach Dan Sekanovich. '

“The biggest mistakes made

were mental ones,” explained-

Lewis. “Hopefully, with the add-
ed experience‘ and the viewing of
the films, the boys have corrected
their mistakes.” ~ -
One of those who made mis-
takes, but came out looking very
good was sophomore defensive

back, Bryant Salter. “Salter scored

the highest grade of any back and
hit the hardest, too,” commented
Lewis. _ '

Some new additions will appear
in the defensive unit -tomorrow.
Sophomore linebacker John Woz-

recovery from an ankle injury.

Junior end Paul Naponick has '

been inserted in the”front wall,
and junior George Pribbish will
probably see plenty of action in
the secondary. .
