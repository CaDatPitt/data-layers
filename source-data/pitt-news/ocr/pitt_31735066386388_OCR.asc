Pitt student killed on turnpike

By Stephen Kozarovich
and Matt Serlin
The Pitt News

A 21-year-old Pitt student was killed
early Monday morning near the Irwin
exit of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

Thomas Harcarik, of Mechanicsburg,
Pa., was struck by a tractor trailer while
walking in the east bound traffic lane of
the turnpike about 1.5 miles away from
the Irwi_n exit, according to
Pennsylvania state trooper John Maczko.

Thomas Harcarik’s father, James, said
yesterday he and his wife were returning
from Pitt with their son on the turnpike

after he had asked them to come get
him.

In the car Thomas complained of
“hearing things?’ and jumped out into the
road, according to Harcarik.

“We were having a conversation, a
very pleasant conversation about the
future, when all of a sudden he jumped
out,” Harcarik said. “If we had expected
anything at Pitt we wouldn’t have been
so surprised.”

Harcarik stopped the car and he and
his wife tried to restrain their son but
“he just slipped through my hands,”
Harcarik said.

The accident occurred at 12:05 a.m.

and Harcarik was pronounced dead on
arrival at 1:43 a.m. at Jeanette District
Memorial Hospital.

The driver of the truck, Michael Miley
of Detroit, was not cited for any viola-
tion and attempted to avoid hitting the
victim, according to Maczko.

“The truth of the matter may, not come
out until we talk to his roommates and
other people,” Harcarik said.
“Something just set him off.”

Harcarik said his son was majoring in
Russian and East European studies and
was planning to go to graduate school.

“He was a good son and an excellent
student,” Harcarik said.

Renovaﬁons

Pitt classrooms receive
auclio/visual updating

By Dina Scardamalia
For The Pitt News

Phase III of a six-year plan
to renovate classrooms on
campus is scheduled to be
completed Aug. 15.

Every year the university
works to update the teaching
capability of the classrooms
on the Oakland campus as
well as the branch campuses,
according" to William Flurry,
director of the Provost
Advisory Committee on
Classroom Facilities.

For this summer, Pitt is
altering 26 rooms in the
Cathedral of Learning and
David Lawrence Auditorium.

The total bill of the con-
struction is approximately

$6.7 million, according to
Flurry.

Renovations are targeted at
audio/visual capabilities in the
classrooms, according to
Mike Marsico, construction
manager for the renovations.

A survey, conducted by the
PACCF, illustrated various
problems with the teaching
capabilities of the classrooms.

Teachers had “found a
hodgepodge of ways to turn
the lights on,” Flurry said
about the survey. “We have
standardized the way of tum-
ing lights on and of 

Marsico, who has been with
the project since its start in
1992, said the ﬁber optics are

Masonic Temple space

open to Pitt, but not yet

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

Pitt officially purchased the
Masonic Temple on Fifth
Avenue in December 1993 for
$8.5 million, but the space
within it will not be fully
available to the university
community until December
1995, according to James
Watters, director of Facilities
Management. ‘

Watters, who executed the
transaction in December, said
the university will lease
almost all of the space within
the 160,000 square foot tem-
ple to the Masons until
December 1995 when a new
facility for the Masons is
scheduled to be finished.

“We have tried to provide
them space in the building.
What was anticipated was that
the University of Pittsburgh
would undertake improve-
ments on the building,”
Watters said.

The Masons sold the build-
ing to the university on a con-
ditional basis — that Pitt reno-
vate the temple.

But “there may be. that cer-
tain areas of the building are
being worked on,” Watters
said.

The Masons agreed to work

around the renovations and

move to different areas of the
building during construction,
according to Watters.

Former /aw dean retires
after 45 years of service

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief C

After 45 years of service, Dean W.
Edward Sell of the School of Law
retired as Pitt’s longest—serving pro-
fessor May 28. ’

“He’s been teaching at the law
school for 45 years and I told him the
only reason we were permitting him
to retire was because he got it right;
otherwise, he’d have to continue
coming back each year until he got it
right,” said Richard Seeburger, inter-
im dean of the School of Law.

V Sell said he stayed at Pitt for all of
these years because he “loves to teach

. and loves to work with the stu-
dents.”

He eamed his undergraduate degree
in economics from Washington and
Jefferson College in 1944 and then
went to Yale Law School. He applied
to Pitt through the placement service
at Yale and joined the faculty shortly
after graduation.

Sell said he had a very good group
of faculty in college generally at
Washington and Jefferson College
who encouraged his academic

progress. He said one professor in law
school, Dean Wesley Sturges, was
probably the greatest influence on
him wanting to be a teacher.

“I always wanted to be in legal edu-
cation even when I was in law school;
it fascinated me.” Sell said. “I felt
[the University ‘of Pittsburgh] had a
great future. I thought it had a won-
derful group of alumni and I had no
occasion to want to leave.”

Sell taught at Pitt for four years and
then left and went into practice
for two years as a lawyer for U.S.
Steel. He then returned to Pitt and
stayed.

“Dean Sell’s contributions to his
community and his profession have

been monumental,” Seeburger said.’

“The law school building, the produc-
tive faculty it houses and the distin-
guished lawyers and judges he has
taught are monuments to his vision
and energy.” ‘

Sell credits getting a permanent
place for the law school as one of his
greatest accomplishments at Pitt.

“I was dean when the building was
built (Jan. 1976). I consider it proba-

“In the university generally I see a lot more proliferation in the administra-
tion than when I first came here. There didn't used to be all the vice chancel-
lors and assistant vice chancellors,” Sell said about changes at Pitt.

Sigma Chi house

p ans stay on sc e u e,
Sigma Chi members say their
fire-damaged fraternity house
will be ready for the fall
semester. .

According to Sigma Chi
member Heath Golden,
whose room was badly dam-
aged in the May 25 electrical
fire, Director of Housing
Services Bob Hopkins has
made “no promises,” but said
Housing Services will do
their best to have the fraterni-
ty house cleaned up.

“At this point, Housing is
under a lot of pressure to fin-
ish [renovating]
Brackenridge Hall,” Golden
said. “But [Hopkins] said
renovation crews will be
helping cleanup Sigma Chi in
addition to the Delt house
and ZBT.”

According to Sigma Chi
President Andy Demming,
Pitt has hired two outside
crews in order to get the
cleanup completed on time.

Delta Tau Delta and Zeta
Beta Tau, Sigma Chi’s neigh-
bors on University Drive,
were already closed this sum-
mer for renovations.

Several students resided at
Sigma Chi until the early
morning fire, which a
Pittsburgh fire marshall later
determined to be caused by a
malfunction in a fan in one of
the rooms.

No one was injured in the
blaze, which caused smoke

and water damage to the
entire third floor‘ of the
house. A

The fire immediately dis-
1313683 eight stiiaéata, to
whom Pitt provided tempo-
rary housing.

The house was officially _

closed on Saturday, June 25
to all residents.

“I made the decision to
close the house because
I thought it would be easier
for the crews to work if
they didn’t have to work
around our residents,”
Demming said.

Demming said the universi-
ty has agreed to replace most
of the items which couldn’t
be salvaged from the fire.

According to several
Sigma Chi members, there
was no problem finding a
place to stay until the fall
semester.

“[Residents] were all

responsible for finding our’

own place,” Golden said. “So
we basically moved in with
people we knew off campus.”

Golden said he is hopeful
the cleanup will be complete
by September because the
Sigma Chi house is sched-
uled to be 100 percent-occu-
pied when the fall term
begins. A

“[The house] is already
under contract for the fall,”
Golden said.

The fraternity house is
owned by the university
which rents property to the
fraternity, which sublets to
fraternity members. Capacity
for the house is 26 residents.

Pitt students take Cl break at Kennywood

By Christine Hanna '
Editor in Chief '

High school, undergraduate
and graduate students from
Pitt’s minority student pro-
grams took last Wednesday off
from school for a day of relax-
ation at Kennywood.

Approximately 200 partici-
pants and the directors of the
10 programs trekked off cam-
pus to ride roller coasters and
water rides as part of an activi-
ty sponsored by Dr. Nancy
Washington, assistant to the
chancellor on minority affairs.

Washington said the activity
was created in an effort to
show minority summer stu-
dents the “university is a com-
munity for both fun and leam-
ing.”

“It was really a great pro-
gram. A lot of the students I
talked to had a great time,”
said Mohammad Ataai, an
associate professor of chemical
engineering and director of the
National Science Foundation
Research Experience for
Undergraduates.

He said it was enlightening
to see all of the students min-
gle.

Kiah Nowlin, a graduate of '

Oliver High School and a par-
ticipant in the Upward Bound
program, said Pitt’s minority
programs give high school stu-
dents a chance to do something
constructive.

“[The Kennywood day]
gives us a chance to relax and
take a break from classes,” he
said.

Wanda Beasley, a junior at
Schenley High School and a
participant in the Investing
NOW program, said Investing
NOW gives students opportu-
nities to prepare for college
and having a special day with
the other groups gives students
more opportunities to meet
other people involved in the
university.

Harold Brown, a Pitt senior
in the Public Health Careers
Opportunities Program,
agreed, saying previously stu-
dents did not interact and
know one another and this is a
good way to achieve that.

Cheryl Fountain, a staff spe-
cialist at Washington’s office,
said the programs individually
have done activities like this,
but nothing as a collective. She
said a lot of the directors did

not know the other programs
existed.

Fountain said bringing stu-
dents of different levels togeth-
er is positive. The high school
students can look up to the
undergraduates and the under-
graduates can look up to. the
grad students.

According to Fountain, when
the students reach a plateau in
their life and are about to make
the next step in their educa-
tion, they can look up at those
students who have continued
with education and say “if they
can do it, so can I.”

The Kennywood Day partic-
ipants are from programs that
include: Investing NOW,
Upward Bound, Minority High

School Research
Apprenticeship Program,
Public Health Career
Opportunities Program,

Minority High School Student
Research Apprentice Program,
Summer Premedical Academic
Enrichment Program — levels
one and two, Natural Science

Fisher’s complaint states

he was removed as chair.

unfairly and the university
officials did notjhave the
right to do so since
the NSABP has its own
executive committee which
has the power to hire and
fire. C A’ I

Fisher is asking for com-
pensatory damage for

_ financial loss, humiliation

and inconvenience and for
damage to his health and

~ ‘reputation; punitive dam-

ages; compensation for
costs, attorneys’ fees and
other relief deemed just and
proper.

Fisher’s removal stemmed
from reports of fraudulent
data in the NSABP studies
at Montrea1’s St. Luc’s
Hospital at the end of March
1994. _

Questions were raised
concerning the auditing
process of the NSABP and
its administration.

The complaint states the
National Cancer Institute
ordered Pitt to remove

- Fisher as chair and principal

investigator on March 29,
1994. Fisher was then
replaced by Herberman.
“The university believes
that this decision and
the subsequent appointment
of Dr. Ronald Herberman

as the NSABP" interim
chairman are fully consis-
tent with _its responsibility
to take administrative action
to assure continuation’ of
the scientific functions
of the NSABP,” Haley said.

According to H-aley,
Fisher remains as a valued
tenured faculty member of
the university’s School of
Medicine;

“The university is sad-'

‘ dened that Dr. Fisher’s reac-

tion to recent events has
reached the point of litiga-
tion, but these differences
should in no way diminish
the remarkable contributions

—Dr. Fisher has made to sci-
fence

and to women’s
health,” Haley said.

As reported in ‘yesterday’s
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review,
the universityhas put a tem-
porary halt to "scheduled
hearings on the NSABP and
Fisher. - * '

The hearings have not

been suspended, Haley said, '
but
delayed due to procedural .

have only been
questions. - .

He said he did not
know when the hearings
would resume, but the
decision would be up to
university officials and

school. This was the first time for.70
years {that the law school had an actu-
al home,] the school was hunting for
its own building and this was the first
time,” he said.

Other than getting a building, Sell
said he has seen many other changes
in the law school as well. ,

“The movement from a local to a
national level law school has been the
greatest and that was accompanied by
increased scholarship on the part of
the faculty and the large curriculum
and so forth,” he said.

When Sell came to Pitt, there were
seven full—time faculty and approxi-
mately 300 students in the law school.
"Now, there are more than 30 full—time
faculty and almost 700 students.

Sell also said the law school is now
more diverse.

from a larger geographical area
and they go out into" a larger geograph-
ical area than the students in the late
‘40s. When I first came here almost all

of the students were from Western‘
. Pennsylvania and were going to stay

here. I ‘see that as a difference.”

“I think the law school has pro-
gressed in every way in terms of the
quality- of the education, quality of the
faculty, scholarship» of the faculty and
so forth,” he said. O

Sell said the university has also

_ changed. “In the university generally I

see a lot more‘ proliferation -in the

administration than when I first came

here. There didn’t use to be all the vice_

chancellors and the assistant vice
chancellors.”

All of the changes and all of the
memories are stored in Sell’s mind and
will soon be in print. He said he will
be writing a book with a lot of photos
and reminiscences.

“I devoted my whole life’s work to
this school," he said. “In return, I have

Sell has probably taught most of them.

ed between Hillman Library
book storage and rental
space for “the university com-
munity and appropriate uni-
versity-sponsored groups”,
according to “Use of the
Masonic Temple — Policy and
Procedures,” issued in March.

According to the policy,
groups are granted use follow-
ing the “University Policy
on Extracurricular Activities”
in which eligibility for
space operates on a priority
basis.

“The priorities for the use of

Renovate-

university facilities are: 1)
Teaching 2) Related internal
university uses 3) Use by out-
side groups,” the policy states.

When priority is in question.
the vice chancellor for student
affairs is responsible for
final regulation of university
facilities, according to the pol-
icy.

But according to Watters,
future renovations in Hillman
Library may result in more
space being used for Hillman
storage, which could mean
less space for general universi-

ty use. ,, A
Groups may rent space in

the banquet room or auditori-
um, each of which seats 540,
or any number of smaller
meeting rooms which seat
approximately 50.

Anyone who wishes to rent
space in the temple may fill
out a Masonic Temple Space
Request Form at the Office of
Conference Coordination, 105
Bellefield Hall. There are a
number of provisions for space
rental defined in the Masonic
Temple Policy, which include:

°University-affiliated groups
renting space must have a uni-
versity sponsor (faculty or
staff member) who “assumes

jjjjjjjjjjjﬁ

responsibility for ensuring that
facility users adhere to the
policies and procedures estab-
lished for the use of university
facilities for extracurricular
activities.” and has an active
university account.

°Preference is given to one-
time events  opposed to
activities with recurring ses-

weddings, etc.) will not be

The goal of the new system
is to allow an instructor to call
Hillman Library from any
classroom on campus and
have an audio/visual program

according to Marsico.

Besides technological reno-
vations some cosmetic
changes are also being made.

“The classrooms need to be
dressed up,” said Marsico.

The changes include adding
curtains to the windows, plac-
ing new projectors in every
room and updating chalk-
boards and lighting systems,
according_to,F,lurry.

Opinions
Anyone have a slingshot?  

KDKA-TV aired a story Monday about a university employee
who plans to sue the university for overtime pay earned, but not
received.

The story stated that the university all too readily docks pay
for employees who leave early or arrive late, but is reluctant to
award overtime pay to those who earned it.

Dr. Bernard Fisher has recently filed a lawsuit against univer-
sity officials.

Fisher’s complaint is that he was unfairly removed as chair of
the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project. The
complaint stated that university officials had no right to remove
him since, according to NSABP bylaws, it has its own executive
committee to hire and fire the chair.

Fisher is suing for damages against his health and reputation,

-as well as compensation for financial loss.

These two examples of Davids who have risen against a
bureaucratic Goliath such as Pitt may signal a refreshing change

from the usual shrug of the shoulders most Pitt employees and. '
students give when they hear of bureaucratic bludgeoning people

have received here. _
People are getting furious and fed up, and are fighting back
against an institution that no one even bothered to oppose before
— the University of Pittsburgh.
Of course we all know what happened to Goliath, don’t we?

A little integrity, please

What a fiasco.

The O. J. Simpson murder case, America’s own modern day
murder-mystery novel, has been turned into a modern day fable of
journalistic incompetence —— courtesy of the media.

A series of false alarms reported by an overeager media has .
brought total embarrassment to the profession of journalism.

First, a bloody ski mask was found —-— false alarm.

It turns out there never was aski mask to begin with.

. Then, a bloody, military spade-like knife was found — false
alarm.» ,;_;

It turns out no such thing was ever uncovered.

Then, a Los Angeles television investigative reporter “broke
open” a hotly disputed story, criticizing the conduct of prosecutors
in the  J. Simpson murder case.

The story suggested that Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark
had arrived at Simpson’s estate before the serving of a search war-
rant for that property on June 13. 4

False alarm — again.

The tape mistakenly thought to have been logged at 10:23 a.m.,
22 minutes before a judge signed a search warrant for Simpson’s
estate, was actually logged at 10:23 p.m.

Journalists have been all over the O. J. story since the bodies of
Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman were found. They have
made many inaccurate reports, most of the time not even double-
checking sources — the first thing any journalist is taught to do
when starting out in the business.

Does the fable of the boy who cried wolf ring a bell with any-
one?

Columnist

ing from a
Rick number of
Cardinali streets in the

South Oakland area. “What is
that crap?’_’ quotes Joe College,
living next door on a summer
sublet lease. Joe College will
be gone come the end of his
lease but that music, charming
garden and steeping teapot on
the porch will continue living
life day-to-day and year-to-
year.

Who are these people speak-
ing in tongues and growing
oddities in their front yards?
Well, they are the very people
who built these striving, thriv-
ing communities where college

students from all walks of life.

live. Where did these people
come from? A lot of them
came to this country when they
were young and sought work in
a free new land. The small
melting pot that makes up this
group of survivors consists eth-
nically anywhere from Italian
to Syrian to Polish to Greek.
These groups formed small

rich foreign A

communities within the large
one of which they were a part.
These people went to work in
steel mills and slaved over hot
furnaces to support large fami-
lies in tough times.

The land and homes in the
South Oakland area are owned
mostly by these same ethnic
groups; people who invested
their hard—earned money-to try
and make their fortune.
Students of the University of
Pittsburgh often wind up being
tenants of such properties. Do
students really know where
they are living? The house in
which they’re having a keg
party could’ belthesairﬁe house
that an entire family built their
lives upon. Many of these

.homes have seen the
Depression and their inhabi-
tants have worked and labored
to feed their families. I

The rich ethnicity in South
Oakland bonds together to
cope with the downfall and
deterioration of their once
beautiful and thriving commu-
nity. Italians, Syrians and
Greeks all intertwine to survive
in a changing environment.
The picture of Joe College has
roosted everywhere in Oakland
and with it has brought a cul-
ture that is separated from that
of the ways of the old South
Oakland. Loud music, drink-
ing, drugs, fighting and vandal-

ism are just a few of the bril-
liant treasures that have seeped
and soured the soil in which
those oaks of time have been
so firmly rooted. Frida Hassan,
a Syrian women, has lived in
South Oakland for 18 years.
She said, “I don’t bother any-
body, why do people bother
me.” Frida claims students that
have lived next to her in the
past have cut her cable line to
feed their own house with the
luxury. “Why do they do this

craziness?” Frida. asked. Frida“

also said ‘fkids come by and
break my tomato plants.”

Does the average picture of

J o‘e’C“o°ll8g‘e l‘i’a§tfé5ﬁpWt9‘l96°tlfi’§
terrible tyrant of which Ms.
Hassan speaks? No! The aver-
age student does not wreck
gardens or steal cable from
helpless old ladies. But we
must remember, to coin a
phrase, “it only takes one bad
apple to ruin the whole bunch.”
The ethnic community of
South Oakland judges every-
one by the actions of one or a
few. Many foreign cultures
have been living in South
Oakland before many college
students were born. We must
respect these people and their
ways so we all can live togeth-

eras they have done for so

very long.

Letter criticizes Harmon editorial

In your editorial, “Too little, too late,” you take
it upon yourself to criticize Vice Chancellor for
student affairs Dr. William Harmon. Specifically,
you discuss Dr. Harmon's comments about Pitt
needing improved recreational facilities. You go
on to state, “To the best of our knowledge
Harmon did not make a noticeable attempt to cre-
ate the kinds of changes of which he recently
spoke.” If you had done the proper research you
would have found this accusation to be false. Dr.
Harmon has regularly attended meetings of the
Intramural Recreational Facilities Working
Group to remedy this situation.

Also, you neglected to discuss Dr. Harrnon’s
numerous achievements at this university. A few
examples are the improvements to the Learning
Skills Center and the guidance he provided to the
Campus Public Safety Task Force which resulted
in our new transportation system.

Additionally, your comments about what the

university’s priorities should be display nothing
more than ignorance. I would encourage you to
read any of the countless studies that have been
done on what it takes to recruit top-notch faculty
and students. Not only do editorials such as this
make the well—intentioned work of student lead-
ers with those administrators who do actually put
the student first much more difficult but it also
casts a negative shadow over the whole student
body} In the future, I would encourage you to do
more research before writing an editorial like
this. If you do, I am sure that you will find com-
ments such as those in your editorial will be
much more accurate if they pertain to administra-
tors located in room 107 of the Cathedral rather
than those with offices on the first ﬂoor of the
union.

You don’t have to believe the hype
that is Lollapalooza, but you sure have
to pay for it. What once was an esoteric,
mispronounced Alterna-Fest is now an
over-hyped money-making apparatus. In
the spirit of the ‘90s the concert features
four bands with —- gasp —— women in
them. If the eclectic Main Stage isn’t
enough entertainment, then ride the
Chameleon, a virtual reality ride.
There’s also an interactive technology
exhibit. Hell, listen tovPoetry Slams, or
browse through some political propa-
ganda/information. When you’re hun-
gry eat international cuisine, drink a
smart drink, stupid.

  

While the bands on the Main Stage
will be familiar to most Lollapaloozees,
it’s important to check out the talent on
the Second Stage whether the bands are
familiar or not. Supporting “the altema-
tive” means cheering for the underdogs,
and that’s what you’ll find here.

In the past, the Second Stage featured
Mosquito, a project with Steve “Sonic
Yoot” Shelley and Half Japanese’s Jad
Fair; d.i.y.’ers Tsunami and local heroes,
the Karl Hendricks Trio.

The whole irony about Lollapalooza is
how it claims to be grassrootsiy despite
the fact that it has become such a major

Palace Brothers/Songs

They’re the Palace Songs now, I
guess, but Brothers sounds a bit more 
well  more Palace to me. The Brothers
are the saviours of country, reaching into
TNN and pulling the dark, deadly music
of Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and
Jimmie Rodgers out of the defiling
hands of Alan Jackson and Garth
Brooks, who do not know how to use its
power. The Palace
Brothers/Songs/Whatever carry the tra-
dition of American music over into the
arena of college rock, which seems to be
the only acceptable way of saving a
‘music these days. Released by Chicago
Hipper-Than—All-Hell label Drag City,
their records steam with Southern inten-
sity and sensibility, and I’m certain that
their live performance will leave us all
drunk from head-spinning purity.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, July 20, 1994

If you’ve seen the commercials for the New and
Improved Woodstock Festival, maybe you’ve real-
ized the absurdity of the whole shebang.

Looking a lot like an MTV video, the ad focuses
on a Smashing Pumpkins—looking kid. As a group
of deadhead—types dance in a circle behind him, he
talks about how Woodstock will bring together
“different people of different socio—economic back-
grounds.”

For $135?! _

Dream on, you naive little product boy.

The original Woodstock revolted mainstream cul-
ture, and a lot of its attendees got in for free. The
new event IS mainstream culture. Not only will the
revolution be televised, it will be mass-marketed
and a lot of moguls will make a lot of money from
It.

Gumball recorded their latest album Revolution
On Ice at Dreamland Studios, located in
Woodstock, N.Y. In between sessions the band
went into town and realized how the meaning
behind the original concert had changed since then.

“Woodstock is now ‘over-the-counter culture,”’
says guitarist Don Fleming. “They’re selling peace
signs that used to sell for a dollar for 20 bucks a
pop! They’ve taken what was cool about it all and
managed to completely retail it.” _

MalcolmRivera, the band’s guitarist/keyboardist
says, “During the Woodstock era of the late ‘60s,

there was a very strong feeling of revolution.’

Revolution was talked about a lot, and the music
was- a part of that social change. It was truly radical
to be playing heavy, psychedelic music then. It
meant something. We’re trying not to forget that.”
Revolution On Ice doesn’t forget the energy of
that era, as well as the punk era, without living off
either of them. It proves that volatile music -can still
be heard 25 years after one revolution fizzled and
got packaged. And it also proves that revolutions in

music can be heard on a major label.

While Gumball proper has existed for four years,
their history dates back to the early ‘80s. In D.C.,
Fleming formed the Velvet Monkeys, ‘which exhib-
ited his knowledge of ‘60s bands like the Beatles,
Herman’s Hermits and the Stooges, along with a
do-it-yourself attitude worthy of the current punk
scene. Through various lineup changes, the band
featured Rivera and drummer Jay “the Rummager”
Spiegel.

A reissue of the band’s early material, Rotting
Corpse A Go—Go, shows that Fleming skillfully
merged pop hooks with a raw garage-y attack.
Naturally the D.C.’s hard-core scene didn’t know
what to make of these brilliant tunes, and the Velvet
Monkeys slipped through the cracks.

After playing with Half Japanese, B.A.L.L. and
Dinosaur Jr., Fleming and Spiegel hooked up with
bassist Eric Vermillion and started Gumball.

The band’s three albums bring together the mem-

bers’ musicalroots. Fleming still writes some of
the catchiest hooks you’d ever want to hear, but the
band attacks the songs with reckless abandon that
recalls B.A.L.L.’s overblownantics. ,

When you get right down to it, Gumball is essen-
tially a good time rock ‘n’ roll band which thrives
on playing live, Vermillion says. “  We’re a
straight ahead live rock band. Onstage, we’re,way
into it.”

Last year’s Super Tasty, the band’s second album
and first for CBS, testifies to his statement. At
times the bandrecalls the golden period of the
Alice Cooper band, kicking out hard rock with
melodies that stick in your head long after they’re

    

Aoven

Rivera joined the band in time to tour in support
of Super Tasty. His presence ﬂeshed out the sound
on Revolution On Ice. In addition to co-writing four
songs, he adds B3 organ, mellotron and guitar to
the proceedings. He also makes the band seem like
another lineup of the Velvet Monkeys — who con-
stantly lost bassists —— finally getting the attention
they deserved. .

Everything on the album, from the cover art to
the music, drives home Gumball’s point about the
state of revolution. Cartoonist Dave Fremont drew
a five—panel cartoon featuring his character Uncle
Crispy lamenting the subject.

“Nights on Fire” reminisces about revolution in
‘67 (“in the air, but our guns were toys”) and ‘77
(“didn’t really get that far”) and concludes by say-
ing “and now you’ll see/ don’t you know that you
gotta be/ eventually you gotta be free.”‘

After the already murky “Trudge” falls apart into
noise and air raid sirens, the band comes out, into a
cover of Blue Oyster Cult’s absurd and black
“She’s As Beautiful As A Foot.”

They don’t offer any answers to the revolution,
but by that point, you’re so satiated, you don’t need
any answers. The music is all that matters and it
doesn’t mean diddly whether it’s on CBS or some
tiny label that only you and 13 of your friends
know about. This kind of music can save your life.

For my money, the highlight of the Lollapalooza
Festival will occur the night before when Gumball
appears at Metropol. Be there to check out the state
of the revolution.

Gumball will be rocking the Metropol at 7 p.m.
along with openers Rust and Inch. Bring your

Lollapalooza tickets and get a dollar off the show.

Let Love In
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds
Mute/Elektra

Nick Cave’s work is a map to the
hellish road laid down in the first two-
thirds of the 20th century by distinct
American music. Following in the tra-
dition of names such as Robert
Johnson, Hank Williams, Jerry Lee
Lewis, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley,
Nick Cave createsmusic trapped some-
where within the tormented family of

‘ country-blues music, spawned of guilt,

Southern Protestant-shouted glosso-
lalia, music of redemption and their
unwedded bastard offspring, rock ‘n’
roll. Within this Bermuda Triangle lies
the range of music traversed on Cave’s
ninth release with his Bad Seeds, Let
Love In. a

For Nick Cave to write an album of
songs based almost entirely on the
theme of love seems too terrifying an
opportunity for self-indulgent, teenage
gloom. After his 1992 masterpiece
Henr_v’s Dream, on which Cave finally
broke free once and for all from the
shadow of his late ‘70s seminal Gothic
noise outfit the Birthday Party. it

seemed as though Cave had nowhere to 
‘record is, of course, the songwriting.

turn to. Henry’s Dream, with its mur-
derous Brazilian cowboy atmosphere
and its darkened storybook songs of
regret—free guilt, was Cave’s attempt to
come to grasp with his own talents, his
abilities to stand completely alone and
yet create music with the Bad Seeds.
To get the desired effect, Cave turned
himself, at once, into both the tall,
fierce cowboy of “Papa Won’t Leave
You, Henry” and “John Finn’s Wife” as
well as the indifferent, drunken bum of
“Brother, My Cup Is Empty,” spouting
hateful lyrics such as “Brother, please
be a brother/ do not let the party grievel
just throw a dollar on the floor/ then
kiss my ass and leave.”

Now that he had established his pres-
ence as an untouchable songwriter,
Cave was able to return to that most
dangerous of subjects, love. Let Love In
contains subject matter similar to
Cave’s previous thoughts on love, from
the Birthday Party through The Good

, Son and even Henry’s Dream: the mur-

derous effects of jealousy, apologetic
self-loathing, straight-backed, hard-as-
nails Bogartesque aloneness and unsat-
isfiable longing. On Let Love In, how-
ever, the songwriting and the deadly
idiosyncratic bed of sound plotted out
by the Bad Seeds reveals an extremely
confident Nick Cave leading a band
which, for the first time in years, is a
semiperrnanent group. The Bad Seeds
have retained what they perfected on
Henry’s Dream, that being the ability to
create and perform music which is
unique and fascinating in its own right,
yet remaining within the groundwork
of the traditions they draw on as well as
serving its purpose as a backdrop to

Cave’s songs.

The most important aspect of this

On his last record, Cave wrote classic
ballads of deceit, treachery, even mur-
der which painted for us a new portrait
of Nick Cave and his ilk. Now, on Let
Love In, Cave reaches for the level of
songwriters, who write songs for them-
selves, but outside of the self-referen-
tial trap of rock-band writing. Pieces
like the album’s closing bracket, “Do
You Love Me (part 2),” which
describes the loss of youth and inno-

cence of a boy in a movie theater, and

the sad Hank Williams slow train of
“Ain’t Gonna Rain Anymore” stand out
as timeless works, living outside the
realm of “.rock;” The relentless apology
that is “gThirstyiDog’i’ becomes, in the
hands of the Bad Seeds, a threatening
display of the lack of communication
which is Cave’s favored subject. The
character in “Thirsty Dog” is apologiz-
ing out of the corner of his mouth,
looking the other way, looking to con-
tinue his ways. It is the same character,
the same Nick Cave, who inhabits the
album’s sweetest and most despicable
lament: the drunken egotistical obituary
“Lay Me Low.”

“Lay Me Low” is a drunken slur
from the mouth of a barroom preacher,
discussing how completely bad, yet
important, he is. It is a paradoxical
piece at best, difficult to decipher
through its levels: the character is a
drunk trying to impress his self-impor-
tance on his peers, though outside of
his mind, he has none. However, in the
case of Nick Cave, the lyrics will prob-
ably hold true (“There’ll be informative
six-page features/ When I go.”) The
song seems to come straight out of a
musical based on the life of a man not

unlike Nick Cave. the same musical
“Do You Love Me (part  or “The
Mercy Seat” from the 1988 _Tender

Prey would be in. Though Let Love In .

contains more of a look back to the
Birthday Party, from a safe distance.
the record’s high points are when Nick
Cave and the Bad Seeds are crooning
more subtly dangerous music such as
these theatrical, unclassifiable songs.

In concert, at Lollapalooza on July
30, expect to hear the Bad Seeds doing
most of Let Love In, and be prepared to
see Nick Cave consumed by the char-
acters of his songs, just as those charac-
ters are consumed by him. Strutting the
stage like a super-confident preacher
man, his eyes glazed into that feral
stare‘, he is a Gothic James Brown,
moving fearlessly around the stage
with Sinatra professionalism and expe-

rience while constantly challenging V

both the band and the audience to take
the music on to the next level.
Meanwhile the Bad Seeds: guitarists
Blixa Bargeld and Mick Harvey, bassist
Martyn P. Casey, drummer Thomas
Wydler and piano/organ player
Conway Savage, will hold down the
stage under Cave’s wolven-ferocity.
They appear as a Texan bar band. fun-
loving and pretension—free, yet mean
and real ugly. Much like Let Love In,
the Bad Seeds will probably be the
sleeper hits of the summer. The album
takes a few listens to fall in love with.
and the band will probably be over-
looked in the glare of the Beastie Boys
and the Smashing Whatevers. but those
who watch will never want for any-
thing more.

the Pixies and Throwing Muses, the
Breeders made a name for themselves
in the indie community. The current
band, featuring the much talked about
Deal Twins (Kim, the former bassist of
the Pixies), has been praised by a more
general audience thanks to MTV.
“Cannonball” was the super—hyped up
single, complete with a video shot by
Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, that must
of landed the Dayton bunch the gig. It
was the “Buzz Clip” that made your

neighbor hum. It was the song that __

made you throw your Breeders album

should be right at home on the only

rap group, that’s for damn sure. They
surpassed that on their second major
record. What they are is the originators
of an entire lifestyle, followed by
teenage boys ‘n’ girls all over the
world. With the release of I11
Communication, the group has passed
into that world of pop music in which
anything can be done, the world where
creativity and complete cool is possi-
ble because of the combination of

commercial success and musical

integrity. The championing of form

The Boredoms

Is this some kind of joke? I don’t
know who pushed for the Boredoms to
be on the bill, but I want to thank
them. It has to be the most perverse
selection in Lollapalooza history, make
that concert history! Even in this var-
ied line up, the Boredoms stick out like
a sore thumb. Perhaps it’s because they
don’t speak English very well. Maybe
it’s because they don’t play music like
Westerners — the Osaka band doesn’t
sound like anybody I’ve ever heard.
The lame description I’ve heard is that
the Boredoms-:are “Japanese hard
core.” The only problem is that I don’t
have a better one. “Japanese
Weirdness” is my stab at pinning the
band down. Colorful, isn’t it? The
band’s front man Yamatsuka Eye, or is

it Eye Yamatsuka, is bound to frighten
many concert-goers with his vocal
blasts and intense theatrics. They’re
noisy, heavy and tripped-out crazy

Clinton. Even I would pay big money
to see that jam session.

Lollapalooza ‘94 needs to balance out the

Palace Songs and Nick Cave. Whether you
call it arrlbient, ethereal or atmospheric, the
Verve’s sound is dulland lackluster. It
recalls the Manchestersound of the Stone

a neutered Rolling Stones, these boys"recy-

advice is listen to My Bloody Valentine'.'and

Certainly their music is Southern pop, but I
couldn’t tell you how it got to be. Their
Warner Bros. debut, Hit to Death in the
Future Head, was so packed with undefined
oddness that two of the band members had
to quit in order to maintain reality. Perhaps
they never will get anywhere, especially
since the last album was a bit of a step back,

I recently con-

Columnist ceming acad-
Jack emic admis-
Becker sion stan-

dards for ath-
letes, information has been _
released detailing the results
that the current standards have
produced.

The NCAA last month fur-
nished its annual graduation
rates report for all 301 col-
leges in Division I.

The report shows that while
the national average rate of
graduation has not been
altered much since the advent
of Prop. 48, the average at Pitt
has undergone a significant
jump.

Nationally, only‘ 57 percent
of athletes who enrolled in
college in 1987-88 (same as in
1986) finished their degrees in
six years or less. However, Pitt
graduated 75 percent of its
athletes that entered in 1987.
That’s 18 percentage points
above the national average and
19 percentage points higher
than the 56 percent Pitt gradu-
ated one year prior.

“The most important thing
our student—athletes do at the
University of Pittsburgh is
earn their" degree,” Pitt
Associate Athletic Director
Carol Sprague said.

The results are beginning to
show just that.

What could possibly be a
reason for Pitt’s success in that
area is that it has higher stan-
dards for freshmen eligibility
than does the NCAA. What’s
more, the statistics show Pitt,
arguably, could be used as an
example for why standards
should be raised.

Pitt has seen its athletes
graduate at a much higher rate
than in years past. In 1985-86,
a mere 55 percent of its ath-
letes graduated. This of course
was before Pitt adopted the
higher admission standards of
a 2.5 GPA than the NCAA’s
current 2.0.

Under the recent report, Pitt
landed near the top of the Big
East Conference in graduation
rates. Providence headed both
the conference and the entire
nation with a 100 percent rate,
followed by Georgetown (95
percent), Boston College (92),

Wrestling team captures big time recruits

Stottlemyer sins national champ, Pe

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
wrestling program has
acquired depth and quality in
its 1994 recruiting class.

‘With the loss of All-
American Rich Catalano and
Jeff Kloiber to graduation,
head coach Rande Stottlemyer
will fill this void with youth.

The wrestling team landed
an impressive group of athletes
headed by a high school
national champion and a trans-
fer from Penn State.

“One of the best local kids
that we got is Chad Jesko, who
is a pretty tough kid.’,’
Stottlemyer said.

Jesko, who is from
Connellsville High School in
Connellsville, Pa. —- the same
school Pitt wrestler John
Richey is from, is a l26—pound
wrestler who finished second
in the Pennsylvania state tour-
nament this year.

“We think that he has the
possibility of starting this
year,” Stottlemyer said. “The
126-pound weight class is a
wide-open weight class, so he
is one of the guys that will vie
for that spot.”

John Hazi, a 105-pound
wrestler who hails from
Reynolds High School, will
most likely get red-shirted his
first year, according to
Stottlemyer.

Atliletic department planning
face-lift for Fitzgerald Field House

By Jack Becker
Sports Editor

The athletic department at Pitt is planning to
give Fitzgerald Field House a face-lift.
Renovations costing approximately $775,000
are on the drawing board for the home of the
Pitt men’s and women’s basketball teams.
. “[The renovations] are still in the planning
stages,” Pitt Associate Athletic Director Carol

Sprague said. “We know our athletic facilities
are in need of improvement and sprucing up.”

 

Part of the renovations are considered to be
general upkeep and maintenance, while the rest
of the renovations are intended, in part, to bring
the field house up to speed with federal Title IX
requirements in gender equity.

Title IX demands the equality of facilities for
both men’s and women’s sports teams.

Tony Dorsett, who
dazzled Pitt fans while

Trophy in, 1976, will be
one of seven new mem-

Hall of Fame. He will be
inducted at 10 a.m. on
July 30 in Canton, Ohio.

him the third all-time
leading rusher in the
NFL behind Walter
Payton (16,726 yards)

Strawberry leading San Fransisco back into contention

' Giants have
Columnist run off nine
Brady in a row and
Slater now find
, themselves

in the thick of the N L West.

Strawberry is hitting .367
with nine RBI in the nine
games. Manager Dusty Baker
had originally planned on hit-
ting Strawberry third with
Matt Williams and Barry
Bonds behind him. But
Baker’s confidence in
Strawberry is already so high
he ditched that plan and now

has Strawberry hitting fifth. So
instead of protecting
Strawberry by batting him
third. Baker has Strawberry
batting behind Bonds and
Williams, insuring that they
will see good pitches.

But it may not be
Strawberry’s bat that has had
the biggest impact on the
Giants’ clubhouse. Never
before mistaken for a Kirk
Gibson-type in the locker
room, Strawberry has the
Giants rallying around him.
His very open desire to turn
his life around has inspired the
Giants right out of their sea-
son—1ong funk.

It looks like Darryl is back,
and he’s making the Giants
look like the favorite to win
the West.

°Speaking of favorites, there
isn’t a Steeler fan alive who
isn’t excited about the start of
training camp. Bill Cowher is
entering his third season with
his best team to date. And it
just may be the best team in
the AFC for two reasons. Neil
O’Donnell’s elbow is healthy
and Barry Foster insists he’ll
be ready for the season opener
with the Cowboys. ‘

O’Donnell’s elbow was
never healthy enough last sea-
son for him to effectively get
the ba.ll more than 20 yards
downfield. And the Steelers’
running game just was not able
to wear down defenses without
Foster in the backfield.

two guys who really make the
Steelers’ offense go and it was

their injuries that hurt the
club’s chances last year.

So now that they’re healthy,
the Steelers shouldjust ink
Eric Green and Charles
Johnson and get this thing ’
started. Because it’s going to
be a fun ride and the sooner it
gets going the better.

°So the Steelers are going to
try and use Dwight Stone in a
kind of Eric Metcalf—type role,
meaning he’ll get the ball com-
ing out of the backfield more.
That’s cool because he sure as
hell can’t catch the ball.

-Hey, if a guy can get away
with a corked bat, more power
to him!

°So there’s no scoring in the
final game of the World Cup,
the winner has to be decided
with a shoot—out, and there are
still people who have the gall

to try and shove that fairy
sport in my face. I hope Tony
Meola eats a face mask in his
first exhibition game with the
Jets.

coaches like the NHL’s Mike

Toronto Blue Jays are nine

they have one last run at it

Lewis begins term as
men ’s frock coach

Pb inking three

isfance runners

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
track and field team continues
to build its program with
recruits under new head coach

Steve Lewis.

“They will add depth to our
distance team,” Lewis said.
“We are very happy with these
three [recruits], they are very
talented.”

The cross country section of
the track program will benefit
from the acquisitions of Scott
Curry, Rich Walsh and Ryan
Buckley.

With the--addition of the
three distance runners to the
track team, Lewis and distance
coach Mark Schwartz look to
strengthen the cross country
events.

“With these three athletes
they are talented enough to be

major contributors to the cross

country program,” Lewis said.
Curry tops the ‘94 recruiting
class after having battled an

Curry, who hails from
Punxsutawney High School in
Punxsutawney, Pa., placed
third in the state in the 800
with a time of 1:55:38.

“He’s a talented kid, one
who is very coachable, intelli-
gent and very nice,” Schwartz
said. “He has had an excellent
high school coach in John
Smith at Punxsutawney.”

“I’m delighted for Scott
because he is a very hard
worker and a good all-around
kid,” Smith said.

_ Villanova (83), Pitt (75),

Rutgers (74), Connecticut
(71), Syracuse (65), Seton
Hall (64), West Virginia (62)
and St. John’s (58). Big East
members that fell below the
national average were Miami
(54) and Temple (46).

Locally, Duquesne graduat-
ed 69 percent and Robert
Morris an embarrassing 27
percent.

The statistics speak for
themselves. Not so long ago
Pitt’s student—athlete image
was on the tarnished side, par-
ticularly when the men’s bas-
ketball team lost all five of its
recruits to Prop. 48 in 1989.
The NCAA report lends sup-
port to the athletic depart-
ment’s efforts to improve that
image.

“Obviously there is an effort
being made to get kids to
graduate,” Assistant Athletic
Director Bill Bryant said. “We
want that trend to continue.”

“Graduation rates are some-
thing where you strive to
attain 100 percent,” Sprague
said. “You don’t always bat
1,000, but that is the goal. We
are pleased to be above the
norm, but every year we want
to get better.”

Pitt fared well in almost
every category. Pittgraduated
95 percent of its women ath-
letes and 67_percent of its
men. The breakdown of grad-
uation in each sport is as fol-
lows: Men’s basketball team
had 80 percent earn degrees,
the football team had. 62 per-
cent, baseball (50 percent),
men’s track (75), women’s
basketball (100) and women’s
track (100). A side note to
those figures is that excluding
football and men’s t_rack there -
were less than five recruits in
each sport in 1987.

reputation at the Student _

NCAA graduation rates vary

from year to year and next
year Pitt could fall back into
the 50 percent range, but the
improvement in this report-is
signiﬁcant enough‘ to warrant
consideration of the notion
that higher admission stan-
dards produce higher grad
rates.

That, however, could be a
dangerous notion because it
means the marginal student is
being left out. Therefore, a
school with higher standards
like Pitt, is not necessarily
doing a better job of graduat-
ing its athletes — just admit-
ting better students. a

Nevertheless, Pitt has ,
improved its image, at least in
these parts. A

By the way, the national
average for all students is
slightly lower at 56 percent
than that of athletes. Again
Pitt was. above average for all
students at 62 percent.

’Maybe admission standards I

do not mean as much as we
like to think. College students
meet the standards to get in '
and we only graduate half of
the time. Why do we worry‘
about admission standards for

athletes when they graduate at

a higher pace?

school career.

“He excels in so many ways.-

he was class president and in
the past he was the starting
point guard on the basketball
team and he gave that up to
concentrate on running,”
Smith said.

Running is something that is
fairly new for Curry who also
ran on the 4 x- 800—meter team

this year that took fourth in the

state.

“He might be able to move
up to the 1,500 meters, he has
the-ability to moveyup to that
range,” Smith said. .

In his senior year Curry had
mononucleosis and missed
much of the cross country sea-
son. Curry will have to take it

slow at Pitt in the beginning, L

Smith said. .
“Scott is basically an 800-
meter man and a 1.600-meter
man,” Schwartz said. “We
hope to see him make an
impact his freshman year.”
Another recruit that will add
depth as well as contribute to

-the cross country team is

Walsh. Walsh, who is from
local Penn Hills High School,
suffered through an illness dur-
ing the outdoor season, accord-

ing to Schwartz.

“He ran 4:24 in the 1,600
and won the 800 meters in the
WPIAL this year,” Schwartz
said.

“At Pitt he will be used
somewhat similar to Scott
Curry, but he is really looking
more at the 1,500 meters
because his best time was
in the 1:57 range,” Schwartz
said.

The last of the distance
recruits is Buckley from
Bishop Hoban High School
outside of Philadelphia.
Schwartz is looking for

Buckley to make an impact in .

the cross country events.

“He won the state AA cross
country event last year and
will obviously concentrate in

that area at Pitt,’.’ Schwartz :

s_aid.

Schwartz said these three
recruits typify the philosophy
of the track program at Pitt.

“The recruiting procedure is V

something that has been
envogued at Pitt, recruiting
kids from Western
Pennsylvania and working

with them,” Schwartz said.

“They will help us do some
things that we have wanted to
do, better,” Lewis said.

Fitzgerald Field House,
built in 1951, was not con-

structed with the guidelines of

gender equity in mind.
“In the ‘50s, the university
had no women’s athletic

‘teams, so there was no plan

for equity,” Sprague said.
“Now we are in a situation
where everything we do is
with an eye toward equity.”
All of this is in accordance
with the athletic department’s
plans to upgrade the facilities

at Pitt. A new convocation

center and improvements to

Pitt Stadium are also in the _

planning stages.

In addition, a new locker
room for the women’s swim-
ming team is currently under
construction in Trees Hall.

The renovations, which
could begin in August,
include refinishing of the
wrestling, swimming,
basketball and
women’s volleyball offices all
located on the second floor. '

Renovation work also
includes the creation of a new
women’s locker roomand
creation of a gymnastics team

‘office where the racquetball

court is located.

Also currently under con-
struction is a project that will
make the main floor entrance
to the field house wheelchair
accessible. .

Some of the work consid-
ered to be general mainte-
nance“includes improvements
to the field house weight
room and a refinishing of the
main basketball court which
is done every other year. V

The renovations, most of
which have not been officially
approved yet, are expected to
be completed by the begin-

ning of the basketball season.
