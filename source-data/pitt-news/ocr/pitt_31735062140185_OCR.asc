Large Crowd Witnesses Rough?

Contest Friday Night between”
Old Rivals, Farmer Again Stars.

Before a large crowd of Pitt and
Tech rooters, the ﬁrsit game of the
series of three between the local in-
stitutions was taken for the. Univers-
i‘ty last Friday night by a score of 30
to 25. The play was both fast and
tough, the extreme rivalry between the

game in the first half, having a lead of
four points when the period was at
an end. Pitt was no't able to secure
a ﬁeld goal in the opening—round,
Farmer’s splendid goal throwing from

ning. '

Tech started off with a rush in the
ﬁrst half by adding two ﬁelud goals
in ‘ succession. Keetz an'd Farmer
missed two from foul, but a moment
later ‘the Blue and Gold forward an-
nexed a couple of fouls an-d the game
began in earnest.

Pitt took a decided brace in the sec-
ond period and after »ten minutes of
play succeeded in tying the score.
From this time on the University ﬁve
retained the lea'd.

Budd and Farmer did the best work

conspicuous for Tech. The wrangling
of Captain Williams ‘did not add to the

speed of the game. The lineup:

"Graduate Manager L. B. Hurst has
announced the Carlisle Indians as the
first ‘definite eleven appearing on the
1911 football schedule. The red skins
are to play here 011 the twenty-ﬁrst»
day of October, by which time both
teams should be in condition ‘to give

an excellent account of themselves..

It will be remembered the‘ Indians
were defeated 17 to 3, year before last
by a team, which was not considered
the equal of last year’s eleven. The
Carlisle team generally proves a good
drawing ‘card in this city and if"the
weather be favorable the game should
be a ﬁnancial success.

MANY OLD TRACK STARS IN

Captain Bryson Has Excellent Basis
to Found Track Team for Com-

The track team for the coming

dates, along with the large number of

newcomers, a large number of veter-

ans. , Chief among the number may be
mentioned: Ross, Halferty, Henry,
Galvin, Bryson, Tinsley an‘d Wooten.
Lambie a star member of last year’s
relay team is not in college this year,
which coupled with the loss of Fresh.
Knotts, by graduation, leaves a con-
siderable gap in the ranks of the run-

developing sufﬁcient green ma'terial to
keep the University in it’s usual place.

The Junior Prom to be held Friday

From statements made by the com-
mittee, it is expected the details for
the success of the event will be Well

thing p_retty ﬁne in the way of a

The paper being circulated among
the students, in order to gain a sub-
stantial ‘basis upon which to work,
is meeting with. success. Everyone
should sign the paper-and aid ‘the
Juniors in establishing the high water
mark of social endeavor in the Uni-

names, which may arise iii the minds
of the class, in orderithat the invi-

Is Vividly Portrayed.

In what ‘was a “wonderful piece of
genuine eloquence,” ‘to use the Chan-
cellor’s expression, Dr. Callen on last

|Friday morning, gave to the students

a vivid conception of the life, times
and work of Savonarola. The speaker
first gave a picture of ‘the age in which
Savonar_ola lived, deﬁning the Renais-

isance as that “era in which the na-

tions of Europe came to their consci-
ousness” and happily compared the
ﬁxing of it’s ‘date to the coming of
spring—felt rather than actually or
definitely observed. Further, he said
that all we have today is the result of
the inspiration of ancient learning.

The majestic and inspired character‘

of Savonarola, Dr. Callen interpreted
with unusual power, leaving a vivid
impression of the earnest, uncompro-
mising anld self-sacriﬁcing spirit of the
great preacher and reformer.

which ‘are held four times a-week, and
of the same length of time.

the chief causes of the unsightly ap-

opportune time of the season of the
year to undertake their labor. But,
that isnot the only blur upon the
premises. Just last week the medical

3THE NEWSPAPER

The college man orwiornan ‘should
be the_bes't reader of‘ the daily news-

, ‘paper, but experience in a large num-
 iber_'_of cases proves the exception to

the rule. It may appear a triﬂe start-

THE CAP AND GOWN "CLUB

The preliminary announcemeiit of,

the cap and gown club, made last
week, indicates that the club is to
have a successful season. The play
to be given this year is hoped to be
the best the University has ever seen.
The competitive plan should bring
out the best «talent in the institution,
and. if the judgment is popular with
the students, the support" offered
should be of the most cordial kind.
Last year the club produced a per-

formance that was a great iinprove-.

merit over the efforts of former years

that of the last season. The officers

of the club are especially anxious to-

secure the aid of the students from
the start and are making an earnest
attempt to get all the men possible
out for the preliminary trials. Every
man who is sincerely. interested in
the welfare of «the University should
lend‘all the assistance possible by
turning ou't_ at all the practices o_f the

cap and gown club and‘ Work hard-for;

STUDENT O_RGANIZATIONS

These remarks, on a subject that
has been so long a matter of sorrow
to the Univer-silty, that has been com-
mented upon so often and from so
manv differeiit sources are written, we
frankly admit, at the outset, in a

,much-raking spirit. How it is to be

taken by the students is a matter of,‘
',secon-diary importance, as the main,

and in fact the only aimiis to indicate
a condition of affairs in what should
be a very important factor in school
life, wi'thout delving into the why and
the wherefore thereof. For our own
part, -we have reached" a pointwhen
we can no longer View with com-
placency the pitiful struggles of the
various clubs and associations to gain
a foothold in the work of "this school
in .the face of an utter lack of sup-
port from an indifferent lethargic stu-

even give them a sufficient excuse for
existence.

But to be speciﬁc. The columns
of last week’s issue of this paper
contained a heart-reiiding wail from
the 'dep'ths of the heart of an earnest
member of the Forensic club, wrung
from him by the defection of about 85
per cent. of the members of that or-
ganization to sustain interest.
Throughout his article, the words of
the writer were exceedingly well
‘taken, especially so, as this Univers-
itylhas never yet had a successful de-
bating time, a fact which the writer
itook care not to omitmerition of;

‘ The Science Club has an average
iattendance of nine or ten. A rather
deplorable state of things indeed! If
‘this University needs one thing more
than another, it is the dissemination
;among the students of a spirit of love
ifor scientiﬁc reading, research, and
ldiscussioii. Surely the ttnrollment,
much less the attendance of the Sci-
;ence Club, is scarcely indicative of the
ipresence of any such widespread feel
iing among us. A

The Classical Club, from the point
‘of members, is perhaps the most ﬂour-
,ishir1g of the organizations. But we
are assufed, from areliable source,
ithat the explanation for ‘this phe-
inonienon does not lie in any extraord-
linary desire on the part of its niem-
‘bers to incorporate into ‘their system
of knowledge, any exceeding familiar-
lity with the life literature customs ‘or
laws of classical peoplesfbiit in the
magnetic inﬂuence of a social given
"about once a month for-the ‘members.
It is far from our purpose to frown
upon any social activi'ty among any
students, in fact, it is the very lack
of it that the editor deplores.

A classical clubishould have for its

;dition of affairs as they exist at the

lpresent time. As bluntly as they ex-
iist, at the present time, this is simply

Ethe writer that probably more en-

ititude of the students ztoward student
‘organizations we contend, in spite of
,many pleas calling attention to 'the
:exc.essiveness of regular school work,
social engagements, late hours at
which society meetings are held, etc.,
is unjustifiable. Every student should
take an active part in the work of at
‘least one orgaiiization, that he may
test the ability which has been en-
dowed him and the knowledge that he
has acquired. This fact is recognized
by the students of other institutions,
where it is not considered effeniiiiate
to belong to a literary societ-~ pe-
dantic to be" affiliated with a scientiﬁc
club, and absolute degeneracy to be in

club. ~~ _ —

In conclusion, it is to be stated that
‘these words, were not written in any
view of malice toward any student or
group of students. The editor- has
proceeded in this writing in the belief
that a_charitable criticism, rather than
an inane, senseless suppression Of
facts, might accomplish some good,
and in the firm conviction “that there
is room for a world of good to be a.c-
complished in this school among the
students themselves.

Club” at a neighboring institution'by

The University of Pittsburgh offers instruction in -eleven thoroughly
organized schools; S

The courses in the School of Liberal Arts are organized according to
the group system which provides broad general culture as well as the oppor-'
tunity for specialization in the latter part of the course,

A full college course for the training of teachers is offered in the
School of Education. Educational theory based on the newest" conceptions
of science, and professional skill developed by unusual facilities at the com-
mand of the University serve as the basis of this course.

The co-operative plan by which students are given practical workein
manufacturing plants will be put into operation in the School of Engineer.-
ing in the fall of 1910._ ' ' i ‘

Newibuildings in the new location in Oakland were occupied‘ by the
College, School of Engineering and the School of Mines in September, 1909.

Anew building for the School of Medicine is now being erected and

is will be ready for use at the beginning of the year 1910-1911.
