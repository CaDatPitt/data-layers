One of America ’s great student newspapers —- since 1906

Students may
vote on USSA

KATIE LEONARD
' Assistant News Editor

The future of the United
States Student Association '
at‘ Pitt once again was the
topic of conversation at the
latest public ' Student
Government Board meeting
on Thursday evening.

Though the board did
not vote on anything
regarding the issue, after
hearing several people
speak out for and against
SGB’s continued relation-
ship with the organization,
board V member Joe
Salvatore suggested allow-
ing students to vote on the .
issue directly through a ref-
erendum in the November
elections. .

’ SGB President Brian
‘ -Kelly reserved comment on
the issue of USSA at the

meeting, but in a later inter-
view, ~ Kelly
though he had not thought
of using a referendum
beforehand, it would not be
too difficult to implement.

P The one problem that
he suggested might exist is
that students voting may
not be fully informed on the
issue and may vote anyway.

The only time Kelly has
seen a referendum put onto
the ballot was last spring
when students voted to have
the SGB term coincide with
the calendar year.

USSA, a national stu-
dent lobbying group, has
come under question by
many groups because -of its
politically liberal stances on
some social-

some Pitt students do not

Black Dance Workshop entertains people of    

KEVIN FUNK
Staff Writer

At 8 p.m. sharp, the sounds of a scratching— and bass-
heavy hip-hop record suddenly began to thump from the
two rear speakers that peered over the ﬁlled-to-capacity
auditorium, inspiring a nearly collective head—tum from
the audience.

Kaotic Fusion, Friday night’s Black Dance Workshop
performance, had begun.

Featuring nearly 20 acts and lasting two and a half
hours, the event transformed the quiet dignity of Pitt’s
chandeliered Belleﬁeld Auditorium into the scene of a
rocking, mid-July block party. I .

As the ﬂailing arms of the soon-to-be—onstage
dancers quickly appeared and vanished through the gap
between the navy blue curtains at the stage’s side, the
seamlessly blended introductory music already had many
members of the audience nodding their heads to the pen-
etrating rhythms.

By the time the announcer belted out that the show
was about to begin, even the polished, earthy-brown, dress
shoes of the business spit-clad, slightly graying, CEO-like
attendee couldnot escape the drum line’s enchanting call.

From the college students sporting do—rags, Sean
John and Nike Air Force Ones to cane-weilding senior ‘cit-
izens decked out in pressed blue slacks, one and all ﬁled

into and found a place inside -the auditorium, ﬁlling the _

main level and balcony seats to the point that many were
forced to lean against the walls instead. ' _

“Welcome to the Black Dance Workshop 2004 spring
show,” roared a voice over the soundsystem. “Have a seat
and be ready to enjoy it!” j

As the lights dimmed, cameras ﬂashed and the antic-"
ipatory applause surged, two purple-robed drurnrners‘

appeared onstage, one using sticks and the other his hands

to pound out traditional African sounds and elicit shrieks

of appreciation from the audience. They were soon joined ,

onstage by six spinning, twirling and prancing dancers,
whose‘ ﬂowing, purple-and-gold outﬁts swayed with
every move they made. ,

Halfway through the set, the lone male dancer non-
chalantly eased his way to front and center of the stage and
began to lead thecrowd in a steady clap that mirrored the
escalating rhythmiof the drums, the only time“when the
audience needed any coaxing to panicipate.

The energy sustained itself through applause _and-
screams of anticipation in the 30 seconds of darkness and
musical silence that marked the transition to the next act,
as a dozen female dancers stood in the stage’s shadows,
not moving and blankly staring out into the audience to
build suspense. ' ,_

When the lights ‘ﬂashed on and the smooth bass lines
began their emanation from the auditorium’s black rec-

tangular speakers, they sprung into action. ‘

Wearing tight, black tank tops‘ and pants accented
with intensely red, hip-hugging sashes, the women
inspired pockets of admirers‘ to leap out of their bumt-red
movie theater-style chairs in. response to their sliding‘,
bouncing and pelvic thrusting. _ \.

“That’s right, girls!” came an anonymous scream of
admiration as they concluded their routine. '_ ,

While this and the forthcoming break dancing were
big hits with the crowd, the biggest applause of the
evening was reserved for arendition of the 1961 musical

“West Side Story.”

' “Yo, Iheard you’ve been runnin’ your mouth, what’s

up with that?” rang the vengeﬁrl voice of one of the male,

dancers from the auditoriurn’s rear, inspiring a sudden

head-jerk by most of the attendees. ~
After one of the dancers ﬂipped his way -down the

subdued-brick-colored aisles, the entire. crew —— three

men and three women —.made their way onstage for a
battle of the genders_break,dancing'_match.  :.\  =

There, the men andwonien alternated','making mock-
ing arm gestures towards each other and trading flips and
head spins. . 

When one of the male dancers performed a back ﬂip
after kicking off from one of the stage’s walls, the crowd
erupted in appreciatory “oohs” andi‘i‘aahs’i and many were
moved to spring from theirseats and swing theirarms
with all the intensity of Steelers head coach,Bill Cowher
launching a red challenge ﬂag. 

“Hope you  are having a good .,.tim.e,l’..~l;he.annoL1nc-
ersaid. _)  A I "

After the evening’s pacts had ended, all of the’ dancers
appeared on stage torhe sound of a lonely  play-
ing the appropriately titled Kanye wést;‘pi“6dtié’éd Jay-Z
track “Encore.”’As the dancers got down one lasttime for

the evening, -the crowd expressed just how much they‘

enjoyed the performance. . 
“Give it up for the Black Dance Workshop!” "urged
the armouncer. A ' _‘ ‘ ’

. And they did.   ‘ " ’ »'

Any particular favorites?     ' l

“Pop that Booty,” freshman Eric Abanquah said. “It
was good; it‘Was sexual.”  ’“ 
Yet, for all the: audience appreciationof the’perfor-
mance, the dancers were just as thrilled with the audience.
“It was great, they got into all the songs,” said-BDW
President Michele Pye, whose group holds two perfor-
mances armually in addition to weekly practices. A
“When I’m up there dancing it’s effortless,” said
BDW member and President of Pitt’s break dancing club,
Open Circle,‘ Nate Trump, as he swung to the sounds of
his fellow BDW member Adam Demby’s drumming.

e “The audience carries me; I get so hyped-up in what I’m

doing.”

comers. A massive truck comes barreling
up the left side, farting black smoke into
our faces. I cough, squint, and pull my
elbow in to avoid losing it. Meanwhile,
another truck pulls a U-tum up ahead,
completely blocking the road, except for a
narrow corridor through which three bikes
speed in the opposite direction, straight at
us. Three schoolgirls hunker on the medi-
an, waiting to cross.

I try to relax, to succumb to the beau-
ty, the romance and the exhilaration of
road travel in the Third Worldfl cannot. It

is a language I do not speak, and for one of '

the few times in my existence, I literally
fear for my life. I pass the time determin-

ing the best way to fall if and when we -

ﬁnally crash. Should I attempt to hit the
ground running, springing from the bike
moments before our inevitable collision?
Should I put a shoulder into the ﬂickering
pavement? Which side would I fall on?
Deﬁnitely my right. I could still manage,
albeit with great concentration and prac-
tice, to play the guitar with only my left
hand. The. calculus of my mortality
whizzes past my head like the hot, dirty
wind rippling past my cheeks. , '

After about an hour of these frenetic
mental musings, Minh makes an unan-
nounced stop at a roadside bar. I dismount
the bike, gratefully, and ﬁnd that my oil-
stained feet are still vibrating from the con-,
stant puttering of -the bil_<e’s foot rests. In
fact, my entire body is ‘shaking, and I take
the cigarette he offers me with limp,
unsteady fingers as we approach the small
table. I order a Pepsi, and it arrives warm,
accompanied by a large tumbler of what I
am convinced is disease-infested
Vretrrarnese ice. But I’m‘ thirsty, so I
attempt to avoid ingesting the ice by pour-
ing the soda in the mug and quafﬁng it
quickly down, ensuring minimum ice
meltage and consumption. I am successful,
but upon finishing it, Minh graciously

reﬁlls the mug -from a potof scalding hot '
tea, instantly melting all the ice. You can’t 4

turn down a drink in Asia, so I smile ami-

' ably and ﬁnish the entire glass.

Against the paranoid odds I concocted
in-my ‘head, Minh and I did indeed reach
the Mekong Delta — and with my bowels
intact. ' Since the government runs a

-. monopoly on the river tours, it’s over-

priced, overrated’ and overwrought with
tourists. And“given the emotional intensity
of ‘the journey there, it was pretty boring. I

spent the majority of the river tour thinking
about how I got there, how the entire jour-
ney had been a leap of ‘faith of sorts, a test
of my belief in many things: faith in the
kindness of a total stranger and in the inde-

cipherable. rhythm of a foreign land; faith ,

in_unknown turning radii and in unseen
drivers’ licenses. « I

On the way back we stop inat small’
_roadside village to meet Minh’s‘.motl1er.:_
She’s a small woman, tan with leathery"
skin and a tailor bytrfade, judging -by the*’
old Singer ‘sewing machine hunkered in a .

. works-in-‘progresis. Herface grows wide."
and excited when shesees me. Minh’s"-.

daughteris‘ -there‘,'too, catching a nap on a

‘ comer mattress. Afterward, Minh takes me

across the street to a_dirn bar with concrete
ﬂoors and walls,éand‘ we have a beer wi_th
his brothers. I look around and realize that
I am witnessing and experiencing the

sanctity of Minh’s daily ritual. Four of us - A

are drinking beer from one bottle and shar-
ing snacks from a communal plate. I am
being treated as an equal. P ‘

The pace of trafﬁc has diminished sig- ,

niﬁcantly with the setting sun as we make

' our waygback to the.city limits, and sohasi -

my fear of dying. Maybe people are on

their way home from work, or into town

"for dinner; perhaps they are taking extra

caution so that they arrive in_ one piece.
Minh and I are an odd sight to.see, I real-
ize, and we draw our share of gasps, smﬂes
and laughs from the throngs of people

USSA’s and SGB’s relationship
has become an especially controver-
sial issue in recent months with the
board deciding at a private meeting in
early February to take USSA out of
SGB’s budget after having already
voted 5-3, in a public meeting, to con-
tinue funding the group.

‘ As it stands now, supporters of-

USSA will be able to apply to SGB for

Other board members, though,
werequick to state that they did enjoy
listening to what everyone else said.
During a’ PowerPoint presenta-
tion, board member Charis Jones said
students concerned about the platform
of USSA should note that it can be

changed and that dues-paying USSA’

members define the group’s platform
each year.
But board member Joe

National Grassroots
Legislative Conference, which includ-
ed a day of
Congressmen and Congresswomen.
Some in- attendance questioned
the fact thatvmany’ board members did
not go on the trip,»especiall'y because
board members-had expressed interest

I

‘in learning more and not knowing

muchaboutthe group.

According to Kelly-, though, it was
not a lack of interest or desire to
attend the conference. It was the tim-

. ing and length of the trip that made it

difficult to go. - ‘
. Last year, only two board mem-
bers went, as well. .
Some in attendance alsostated
that, if board members or others did
attend the conference, their opinions
regarding the actions that USSA takes
might have changed. '

Kelly, in the later interview:

-responded to this by saying that
everyone who went on the trip actual-
ly was a‘ supporter of USSA before
they left for the trip, and that needs to
be taken into account when evaluating
their testimonials.

Board member Matt Hutchinson
questioned the passion of USSA sup-
porters and their inability to get even
12 people to attend the conference.

No students who signed up for the
trip were turned down by SGB.

Meanwhile, Morris expressed
frustration about the inability of the
board to compromise on the issue.

' “We hate to listen to other peo-

lobbying U.S. V

supporting the
war ‘in Iraq.
Though she may
not agree with the war, to continue

-having the benefits of living in the

United States, she continues to pay
taxes, similarly to students who may
not agree with USSA’s policies and
have to pay anyway to get the benefits
that this organization offers students.
Some students, including Jared
Solomon, said they wanted-to see a

return on campus for their USSA

investment. Solomon added that he
was willing to support USSA involve-
ment so long as it was only on a trial
basis. _ ,

According to Jones,‘ one example
of USSA’s campus involvement is the
Get Out The Vote campaigns. '

Many people who spoke at the
meeting mentioned how USSA was
involved with getting the'Pell Grant’s
rates increased in recent years.

They added thatabout 60 percent
of Pitt students are recipients of the
grantand suggested that all of those
students would, therefore, support a
continued relationship, with’US SA.

But board member Liz Blasi, who
is a recipient of this type of grant, said
she did not know where she stood on
the issue. And in the public vote in
January, Blasi actually voted against
giving money to USSA. -

Board members Amit Kotz and
Pasqualichio ‘also voted against the
funding. *

the Pell Grant would continue to «V

exist.
It was suggested by many oppo-
nents of USSA, including College

Republicans President Brandon Boyd,’

that the lobbying effort should be
focused in Harrisburg rather than in
Washington, D.C., since Pitt does
receive financial assistance from the
state. .
Others, including Jones, said that
though SGB needs to sustain its voice
in Harrisburg, the ongoing involve-
ment inyWashington, D.C., is impor-
tant ——-. especially to help students
from outside the state, who may ben-
efit more from federal assistance.

She added that it is easier and
more convenient to have a full-time
staff work on addressing issues at the
national level rather than having a
bunch of individual students or even
schools trying to do it separately.

I And the USSA member ‘schools
do have a full-time staff that can work
on researching and compiling infor-

mation on the issues that the members ‘

chose in their summer planning ses-
sions —— this year’s session will be" in
Pittsburgh. A

‘The students involved are then
taught about the issues during the
annual conference, which is ended
with National Student Lobby Day.

According to Jones, USSA is the
only organization that givesall stu-
dents a voice on Capitol Hill.

Responding to statements from
some in the crowd that most people
would not be able to easily set up
appointments with some congressmen
and congresswomen, Laurel

Schwartz, who scheduled Pitt’s lob- I

bying meetings, said she did not say

she was calling on behalf of a USSA— ,

sponsored group. V

She added that some representa-
tives have not even heard of USSA ——-
though she described USSA as being
the “premier organization that repre-
sents students’ rights.” -

Michelle Turbanic, a Republican,
questioned why Pitt could not just
send students to participate on the
lobbying day without being directly
involved in USSA.

The board will only be holding
public‘ meetings two more times this
semester, and during that time, it is

April Fool’s about humor, not hatefulness

The editor responsible is blam-
ing fatigue and deadline pressure for
printing an egregious racial epithet
in a local college paper.

In a cartoon in which a‘ goat
brags to a mouse that he struck a
black person on his bike, the black
person is referred to by a particular
racial slur. The punch line from the
mouse was, “Only one?”

The cartoon was but one exam-
ple of sophomoric, misogynistic,
violent shock humor in Carnegie
Mellon University’s paper, The
Tartan, billed that day — April
Fool’s Day — as The Natrat. A full
page was devoted to poetry about
raping a teacher and violating a
woman with an ice-skate blade, laid
over a graphic of a woman’s nude,
spread groin, inset with a detailed
diagram of her vulva.

For the editors to claim that
deadline pressure caused them to"
make such revolting mistakes is
simply ludicrous. The Tartan comes
out but once a week, and the April
Fool’s edition is a special, once-a-

year event. If The Tartan was on the

ball enough to secure $2,500 in stu-
dent activities money so that the
issue could run without advertise-
ments — they were -—— then it stands
to reason that they were aware
enough of the impending issue to

give second and third and 50th

thoughts to running such pathetical-
ly unfunny and disturbing content.

This abomination can’t be
explained under the umbrella of
satire. The editors all knew that the
April Fool’s edition would be a
chance to get away with saying off-
color things, and if racial hatred and
violence against women are what
they’ve been waiting all year to be
able to say, then that indicates some
serious personality issues for them.

The editors have proposed a
content review board consisting of
administrators and faculty members.
This is a band-aid solution, a gloss-
ing-over of a greater problem, and
contrary to the nature of student
journalism. The students involved
should take a look at their own val-
ues, not look to a higher authority to
save them from themselves.

The entire editorial board of The
Tartan must resigniimmediately and
undergo sensitivity training. Next
week, they should print an apology,
and then not publish for the rest of
the school year. They should not,
though, be expelled, as some are
calling for. They should have to
attend classes every day for the rest
of the term, facing the students they
have harmed with their pointless
vitriol.

From the Wire: Good luck, Air America

I EFF POSTELWAIT
Daily O’Collegian (Oklahoma State U.)

On Wednesday, the Air America
Radio network began its first broad-
cast. Air America combines the tal-
ent of political satirists, commenta-
tors and various liberal pundits. The
stated goal is to combat what they

V call the right-wing monopoly of AM

talk radio. Is this a good idea? A
more important question in the for-
profit talk show circuit is whether it
can catch on and turn a profit.

As it is, the Air America squad

‘is cooped up in apiece of cramped

New York City office space. The
ﬂedgling station is broadcast by
half a dozen carriers in scattered
locations. These are not test mar-
kets; these affiliates are simply all
the airtime the station could afford.
The producers are relying on out-
of-pocket money and donations to
stay afloat for the moment;

If you don’t live in one of these

small broadcast areas or own a.
satellite radio, y_our,only way of .

getting, a feed is online at
www.airamericaradio.com. At the

‘time, the Web site is hard to access

because of high traffic. Their signal
strength is lousy, but the program-
ming itself is not that bad. Al
Franken, Janeane Garofalo and
company have put together some
professional-sounding shows.

But how can this tiny network
compete with such staggering com-
petition? Self-proclaimed right
wingers like Sean Hannity, Rush
Limbaugh, Neil Bortz and a cast of
dozens more are, frankly, very suc-
cessful. Say what you will about
them, but they have found their
niche in radio + they fairly domi-
nate the medium. Who will succeed
in the end? It’s not a matter of
who’s right and who’s wrong; it has

 

more to do with where people go
for their news, information, enter-.
tainment and‘ infotainment (that

being enterta«inment’s bastard
cousin). '
Most people who consider

themselves conservative listen to
the radio. or watch TV news to get
their fix."-. More liberals go online or
read the papers. Besides that, the
format of modern talk radio fits
conservative dogma like a glove.
Facts, matter little, opinions.
don’t need to be respected, and it’s
all about who. can scream the loud-
est — or in O_’Reilly’s case, who
can cut the mic off quickest.
Liberals don’t belong in this envi-

_ ronment as it exists today. I under-

stand .what they’re trying to do
here, but does the left really need a
Limbaugh of its own?

Limbaugh isn’t‘ despised by the
left simply because he’s a conserva-
tive, but because he has no respect
for opposing voices, he doesn’t
challenge his "audience to think,
he’s rude, and heweaves most of
his arguments from insults and
“exaggerations.

Is that what liberals want? Most
lefties I know are willing to con-
cede that most issues are too com-
plicated to be boiled down to sound
bytes and childish name-calling. It
isn’t necessary to resort to their
methods '— at least’, I hope not. I’d
expect the author of “Rush
Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot” to
understand that you shouldn't sink
to that level’. .

I hope that the folks at‘ Air
America are attempting to change
talk radio instead of just imitating
all the worst behavior of the Ann
Coulters and Michael “Savage”
Weiners that they’ve -come to

Some unsolicited advice for our neighbors at CMU

Dear Sex N’At: _

/
./

We are the editors of a weekly college paper
here in Pittsburgh. Our school has a
reputation, deserved or not, as an
enclave of privileged white folks
who are more book-smart and maybe
less so socially smart. We’ve noticed

ing a yearly tradition of a funny,
satiric issue on April Fools Day. This
year, we got our April Fool’s edition

paid for from student fees — like
your Student Activities Fee, basical-
ly. *

This year, we might have gone a
little bit overboard, like making a ,
joke about running over a black guy (but that’s
not what we called him, ha ha!) and lots ofjokes
about violent rape. We even credited some of our
staffers as being “Token Black Guy,” and
“Random Asian Name.” We were awfully tired
when we signed off on these pages, because, let
me tell you, it’s hard work putting out a paper
once a week, and we were working really hard
coming up with funny jokes.

Now, a lot of people are mad at us. There was
a rally at our campus calling for us to resign or
even be expelled. Nobody got our jokes, I guess.
How dumb can people be, not seeing the humor
in poems about how funny it is to rape a worrian
to death with an ice skate blade! What’s funnier
than that?

So, whatshould we do?

Opinions Editor

—The Natrat Kids

That letter, kids, was fake.

They didn’t ask for it, but I have
some advice for everyone even remote-
ly responsible for Carnegie Mellon
University’s April Fool’s edition.

Resign from the paper, resign
from your social lives, and immediate-
ly seek therapy.

The weekly Tartan ran a super-
hilarious spoof paper called the Natrat

.. — clever, clever! —— and-paid for the
whole thing with $2,500 in student
fees, so that no advertising ~would
interrupt the flow of sick humor.

Now, some of you may have
noticed that I write about sex every week. I hear
a lot more than I publish, and I have a very thick
skin. In fact, I am, just about unshockable. At
least, I thought I was, until I got hold of a copy
of the‘iNatrat.

Getting that was no mean feat, because all

 

the physical copies are being pulled from ne_ws- ‘I

stands and presumably destroyed. Luckily, an

eagle-eyed colleague of mine grabbed a cbpyl-,'and;_

let metake a gander. .  _
The hatred of women and the unbrid_l'edf‘v_io-
lent tendencies expressed toward ithe‘.-fefrnale

\ body that this piece of crap exudes made riieffeel
physically ill. I literally felt faint when I read‘

what these kids thought was funny. Because we
have standards here at The Pitt News, I can’t
quote from any of it.

I’m a huge fan of free speech and pushing the

envelope. I think a college paper is a great place
to put things that don’t necessarily belong in a
regular paper. The audience is narrower and is
generally at a time in their lives when they are
more receptive to racier content, but old enough
to handle it. I

What these kids put out, though, was childish
and gross for the sake of being gross. None of it
was even remotely funny, except a doctored

graphic of the Cathedral with the Eye of Sauron.

on it, ‘glaring down at CMU’s campus. It’s like
all the frustration these kids havebeen feeling
all year has come out in one wave of vengeful
angen
' It’s frightening tokpresume that people still
hold such disturbingly low opinions of women
and people of other races. It’s even more fright-
ening that such opinions are published and are
being disseminated so widely.
Hearing the editor in chief blame deadline
pressure and tiredness for letting this “slip” is
complete bull. A slip is missing a comma. A slip

is spelling a name wrong. Putting out_l2 pages of 
complete hatred, with the n-word as the icing on "

thecake, isn’t a slip; it’_s indicative’ of people

pwfith scary ideas thinking they are edgy and
V funny. .
_ 7?; College media is great. I’m going to shed a

teairifwhen I graduate and move on from college
media. The Natrat Squad has abused an institu-
tion, and they ought to hang their heads in
shame. And never, ever get laid again.

resent. That’s not going to inspire

r any thought — just more bitter-

ness. There’s nothing to gain from
that, except maybe money.

There are two -possible paths
for Air America to take, as I see it.
One: They can stick true to what
it means to be liberal and. respect
other people’s view's“"rather than
insulting them. . . p , N

This will probably, res_ul_t. in
dismal failure,. be,,cause.g no one
wants to hear intelligent discourse
on talk radio — not yet, anyway.

Or two: They can become

“Limbaughsof the Left,”_.catering. I
to people’s expectations‘ of the,

talk radio industry by being abra-
sive, demeaning and putting style
over substance in,.the content of
their shows. I * V

More likely, since th/eyi will

have to compete viciously if they
want to get their station off the

ground, they will take the second —
route. This might help keep them

alive, but it would defeat the pur-
pose of having liberal radio.

I’m not saying that they can’t
have fun. If Air America is able to
strike a good balance between
humor and integrity in a medium
where one is often sacrificed for
theother, then they will go far.

‘But from what I’ve seen and
heard so far, I think anger and vit-
riol will overwhelmthe whole of

talk radio,,_r'egardless of whether I

the left isialpart of i_t_or not.

I wish. Franken and his team
the best, "but I hope they watch
their step. To do ‘what they are
trying to do and do it right, they
are going to have"'t'_o change,;the
face of American ‘talk. radio’ forev-
er. V  ~ - .
Let’sl.hope it’s. a change for

.the‘ better, where ._both sides get a
‘say for a change, individual

thought is encouraged and the
ultimate goal of it all is to inform
the listener rather than pander to
ignorance and inflame ‘ old
hatreds.

“Range” is good — and that’s no bull

Home on the Range
Starring Roseanne Barr, Judi
Dench, Jennifer Tilly, Cuba
Gooding, Jr., Randy Quaid,
Steve Buscemi

Directed by Will Finn and John
Sanford

72r<£n’.‘r

The last few weeks of classes got you
stressed to the max? Take a timeout and
catch “Home on the Range,” the newest
effort from the animators at Disney.

“Home _on the Range” follows the
adventures of three cows as outlaw

V Alameda Slim schemes to take posses-

sion of “Patch of Heaven,” their farm.
Racing against karate-kicking stallion

Buck and bounty hunter Rico, the cows ' I

venture across the West to capture Slim
and collect the reward money needed to

save the farm. With eccentric characters-

and cute — if somewhat predictable -
punch lines, the journey is a fun one.

For the first time in what feels like
forever, Disney gives some really likeable

main characters. Prize-winning bovine
Maggie is voiced by Roseanne Barr, who
gives a stunning performance and cap-
tures Maggie’s complete lack of ﬁnesse
and manners (my, how appropriate); Judi
Dench voices the somewhat anal-reten-
tive Mrs. Coloway; and Jennifer Tilly
rounds out the trio as the voice of new-

age thinking Grace. Tilly’s performance
steals the show, as she provides the off-
key singing that proves to be the ﬁlm’s
funniest running punch line.

The supporting cast excels as well.
Randy Quaid is phenomena] as Slim —
his rendition of Slim’s evil yodel (yes, I
said evil yodel) is the best musical

moment of the ﬁlm. The animation of the
scene is a return to Dumbo’s “Elephants
on Parade,” and will make you pine for,
the good old days when Disney was still
top-notch. Lucky Jack, a peg-legged jack
rabbit, and Jeb, an omery goat, get most
of the punch lines and save the ﬁlm from
falling into sappiness.

The animation and background visu-
als of “Home” are traditional Disney. In
an age where hand-drawn animation is
being cast aside for the realism of tech-
nology, the animators make a surprise
move in “Home,” going back to more
simplistic drawings. The characters are
boxy, and at times appear almost two-
dimensional, racing across a Looney
'Dunes—esque background. Though not all
that visually stimulating, with this style of
storytelling, it works. .

“Home on the Range,” admittedly, is .
V no “Finding Nemo.” But it’s not

‘Treasure Planet” either, and that’s, reason
enough to see it. This is the last hand-
drawn Disney ﬁlm — go out and see it
while you have the chance.

The Top 151‘ Drinking‘ '
Songs ”
Rich Stewart

Craphouse Press

2004

7.“n’,‘n2r1/2

In the introduction to his book
“The Top 151 Drinking Songs,”
Rich Stewart ruminates on the his-
torical importance of booze on the
world and, specifically, Americans.
He uses the national pastime of
going to a bar in connection with
another American fascination — the
list —— to create a compilation to

help all those drinkers out there that .

get befuddled when they step to the
jukebox at their favorite bar.
The list is an eclectic, some-

what surprising one, especially as

you get to the top of the pops —— or
would it be hops? The songs mak-
ing up the 151 top drinking songs

around   L

A

I‘ run the gamut,’ from rock to pop, .
country to traditional _folksongs. 

There are even a few punk and‘ glam
tracks to fill out the list.
Accompanying each song in the
book is a fairly in-depth description
of the song and why it’s an appro-
priate choice for your jukebox dol-

lars. This is very much to Stewart’s ,

credit. He could have just as easily

‘listed, say, “Red, Red Wine” by

UB4O — which is number 27 on the

list —- and had a one- or two-line

explanation. “There’s wine in the
title,. what more do‘, you need,”

' could have been such a one-liner.

Instead, Stewart places facts about
the song, the group and bar culture
in these descriptions, making for a
full experience.

Through such expansive writ- ’

ing,‘ Stewart stretched what could

have easily been a 25-to-30-page

book into one that’s a l18—page

An exhibit that reinforces the powerof art

Show Here Gallery ’

945 Liberty Ave.

Expressionist splashes of unmixed tempera
converge, in rays of pure red, green, black and
yellow, into a tensely powerful composition in
Brad OVerton’s untitled painting. Brian Kremer’s
piece, hanging next to Ove,-rton’s, is also an unti-
tled work, with strong, mingling color fields. The
gallery is Downtown. The exhibit is called
“Express.” And you won’t see works by these
artists anywhere else. .

Overton and Kremer are two of the many par-
ticipants in “Everyone an Artist,” an art therapy
program sponsored by the Allegheny East

the Ice House Artist Studios, works with adults

who have developmental disabilities and/or men-
tal illnesses. “Everyone an Artist” explores art-
making as a process with no rights or wrongs, but
as a form of human expression that is accessible
to everyone.

According to the Allegheny East newsletter,
the goal of art therapy is “not to produce beauti-
ful art, nor is it to instruct talented, well-taught
artists. The goal of art therapy is to help people
feel good about themselves, help them communi-

cate with others, and help them take charge of .

their lives responsibly. Art therapy makes use of
the fact that creativity can itself be rewarding. In
doing creative work, we externalize our thoughts
and emotions, making them clearer to others and
ourselves. More importantly, creativity produces
feelings of accomplishment. This enhances self-
esteem and independence.”

“Everyone an Artist” seeks to “develop self-
expression, self-esteem, problem-solving skills,
interpersonal relations, artist potential, involve-
ment in the local art community, and production
of marketable artwork.” _

, Most of the 40 pieces on display, in tempera,
watercolor and marker, are for sale with proceeds

benefiting both the artists and the studio. And not
all the art resembles the non-representational
work of Overton and Kremer. Others depict con-
crete objects, such as “My Spring Picture,” by
Karen Slowik, which is a cropped and sketchy
tempera painting of a sunﬂower rendered in the
brightestiyellow and green. There is even an
abstract piece by Edna Mae Christmasrcalled
“Halloween,” which has neon— and ﬂuorescent-
colored letters oozing down a black background,
spelling no discernable words but evoking the
title with distortion and hue.

What underlies all the art in this show is a a

strong sense of honesty. The bold and steady.
brushstrokes and the depiction of everything from
Easter bunnies to Jesus show that the interests of
each artist are being represented unabashedly.
Theemotive nature of each work is different, but
the sense of candid determination is uniform.
The work of the “Everyone an Artist” partici-
pants is inspirational, to say the least. This exhib-

it is a much-needed reminder to the-regular‘

gallery hopper about the fundamental importance
that the artistic process can have to the artist.

What’s a copy of Y M doing in my mailbox?!

AMANDA WALTZ '
Staff Writer

I like to read degrading, idiotic trash as
much as the next girl. I bask in the

unapologetic superﬁciality of Lucky mag- -

azine, ﬂipping through page after page of
the “ﬂirtiest skirts” and ridiculous instruc-
tions on how to achieve that “pretty punk”
look (yes, apparently such a thing exists). I
enjoy sitting back with a thick, glossy copy
of Cosmopolitan, combing through the
piles of monotonous sex tips and dating
articles in hopes of ﬁnding that new, “Oh,
I’m So Embarrassed” story about how

* some chick farted while doin’ the deed

with her hottie co—worker. t
However, I became very distraught
when I discovered an issue of YM —_ or
Your Magazine — in my mailbox recently.
Now, for thoseunfamiliar with the publi-
cation, it’s basically the poor girl’s
Seventeen, with columns for the adoles-

cent girl soon to be reading Cosmo, touch- ‘

ing upon such hot-button topics as “Are
Sparkles This Year’s Glitter?” and how
freaking awesome lip, gloss is. How this
infantile crap weaseled its way into my
mail, I can only. guess. Ido know that,
upon scanning the cover, I realized that this
particular reading material was less mind-
less, innocent entertainment and more
mindless, insulting drivel. I

The first feature that caught my eye

     

was the title in big, bold letters, “1O Hot .

Guys. Help One Get ‘A Scholarship.” Sure
enough, further inspection led to a spread
of 10 hairless, half—dressed young men
brandishing sports equipment that their
girly, little ﬁngers had probably never
touched prior to that photo shoot.

And how, pray tell, can you help these
promising, young jackasses win that covet-
ed $10,000? Why, by judging them on how
they answer asinine questions, of course.

It’s a battle of intellect where one has
to decide between a date with Christina or
Avril, or if he would rather have either a
third nipple «or a sixth toe and why. When
asked the latter question,. 16-year-old
Derek Ebner answered that he would
chose the sixth toe because it could help
him “swim really fast.” Gee, logic like that
should make any girl want to indulge in
some spoiled, pretty boy’s future. Maybe
after our little Rhodes Scholar makes his
fortune as a brain surgeon, you can totally

marry him so that he may bless your womb

with one of his bony, worthless offspring.
Next was the ever-insightful “Grade
the Guys” column. It seemed harmless at
ﬁrst, with confused young women con-
tributing stories on their latest guy trouble,
allowing the scourge that is the YM staff to
grade the young man’s character. For
example, one starts, “I was totally into this
guy and got the courage to ask him out,”
only to end with the writer being jilted

A Attenion Ns nd LPNs
Are You Looking For A Challenge?

because, a week later, the boy was still try-
ing to decide between her and another girl. ’
Well, Buster Brown, you get a C-. Put that
in your airplane glue and sniff it. Maybe
now that she has been reassured of the
boy’s unsatisfactory behavior, Karina, age
12, can finally sleep on her pink, marabou-
feather pillow at night. —

If this wasn’t bad enough, these two
features are followed by an article intro-
duced as “Say It: Feminist is Not a Dirty
Word.” Dedicating an entire magazine to
warping the minds of children into prema-
turely engaging, in boy-crazy, petty dating

crap is one thing, but to then try and throw '

in some vireak resemblance of integrity
near the end is a whole different story. The
demographic this magazine caters to can
barely read at an eighth-grade level, let
alone comprehend the conﬂicted, hypocrit-
ical attitudes presented in this second-rate
rag. An 18-year-old, fully developed, edu-
cated woman reading about it is one thing,
but to a group that’s 12-16 years old, it’s
just another way to manipulate the already
impressionable minds of young girls.
After the article on feminism, the
magazine presents the statistic that in2002,
57 percent of all bachelors degrees were
given to women, asking the question, “So
where’s our girl President already?” ‘
Indeed. Perhaps she’s too busy trying
to help some pre-pubescent, skateboard-
star-wannabe win a scholarship.

Don’t make an example of
Barry.
At least, that’s‘ what the lawyer

of San Francisco slugger Barry‘

Bonds says‘, the federal government

-is doing.

Michael Rains claims that the
government is trying to set a per-
jury trap for Bonds in the Bay Area
steroid scandal, as reported by The
New York Times.

For those of you that have been ‘

living in a hole or.cave or drunken
stupor for the last six months,
Bonds’ personal trainer, Greg
Anderson, was one of four men
indicted on charges of illegally
supplying "performance-enhancing
drugs from the Bay Area
Laboratory Co-Operative.

All of them have pleaded inno-
cent of all wrongdoing, and in no
way am I saying that anyone here is
guilty of anything, but there are

two big reasons why the federal

government might be focusing on
Mr. Bonds.

The simple guilt-by-association’

could be one of them.

A personal trainer is just that —
personal. He or she is there to help
you —- and to make sure that you —
stay physically fit through a sched-
uled workout regiment.

That means this person is keep-

ing track of everything you do,

including everything you put in
your body. Since Bonds’ personal
trainer is being accused of having
some kind of involvement with the
use of steroids, it makes sense to

NFL could be playing
a big joke on players

PATRICK KINMARTIN
Daily Trojan (U. Southern California)

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES — I admit,

I’ve seen some whoppers in my day — ,

tying the geek’s Shoelaces together, spiking
the punch at prom, super-gluing quarters to
the ground —- but nothing can compare to
the fast one the United States judicial sys-
tem is about to pull on Maurice Clarett and
former University. of Southern California
r.eceiver'Mike Williams.

In what could turn out to be a rather
harsh April Fool’s hoax on the two players,
this week a three-judge panel of the U.S.
2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
scheduled a hearing, on April 19 or 20, of
the league’s appeal on the original order in
the Maurice Clarett case. ' ,

The appeals court will consider

whether to affirm or reverse the Feb. 5 order,

of U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin that
declared Clarett eligible for the draft and
allowed Wﬂliams to. enter, as well, despite

‘ being a college sophomore.

M Both have hired agents and are no
longer eligible to play collegefootball. Ifthe
court rules favorably on the NFL’s appeal,
they will be blocked from the this month’s
draft without the opportunity to play in the
league — and make millions by becoming
high draft picks, as they had originally

. thought they would be able to do.

‘Mike, Maurice; take a look right over
there, and over there [as cameras pop out of
both designated locations]  you’ve been
punk’d!”'

~ ‘ Only, in this episode, Ashton Kutcher

does not sprint out of nowhere and start

gawking around like a headless ostrich.
Instead, it’s Jeff Pash, an attorney represent-
ing the NFL in the case, delivering the blow.

Pash called this week’s developments .

“positive,” adding that he felt there was a
“very substantial chance” the players would
not be in the draft.

“I think it’s an indication, along with

’ the time [the judges] spent today, of ﬂre seri-

ousness with which the court of appeals is
taking this matter, and the seriousness with
which they are considering the arguments
we putto them as to why [the] district judge
got this case wrong,” Pash said. I ,
Which is why he and other NFL ofﬁ-

-cials were giddier than a Girl Scout get-

together after the decision was made. The
league has bemoaned the Clarett decision
from the get-go, and as soon as W1lliarrrs'
followed, it knew it had its hands ‘full in
ﬁghting ﬁeshmen and sophomores), from
entering the draft

The thorn in its side was about toget
sharper on April 24, when Williams was
supposed to be a ﬁrst-round selection. The
NFL knew that occurrence would only
elongate the drool hanging from the mouths
of young college superstars across the
nation eager to bust into the league, even
though they lack the ability to play at the
level that has made the league the best of its
kind. " _

Some legal analysts have pointed out
that the decision of the appeals court to
hurry on a decision indicates the court was
unhappy with the district court’s decision +
which, in this case, was the landmark
Clarett ruling. I

But for Clarett and Williams, the real

. world“ they left college for is about to get,

well, a lot more real. .

There is a possibility jVV1lliams could
petition the NCAA for reinstatement if the
NFL‘ultimately prevails, but that would lead
to even more court orders with more legal
jargon than this column could stomach.

Mike, Azzarelli, Wﬂlianrs’ agent, has
not indicated whether he would take such
action yet, perhaps suddenly shocked while
realizing he might have been ﬁnancially
better off representing Wﬂliarn Hung. A I

No one, however, will come away from
this possible decision with as much egg on
their faces as Clarett and -Williams. Clarett
gloriously accepted his role as the banner-
carrier while challenging the decision
unapologetically. And when the court ruled

in his favor, he entered early NFL draft com— ‘

bines reportedly overweight —‘ as if he were
asure thingtornakeitinhisroolcie season.

Williams exercised more caution
before making ofﬁcial his plans to leave,
speaking with USC coach Pete‘ Carroll and
others about the dangers of making the

. jump to the league. Carroll said the decision

made this week to block the Clarett ruling
wasoneoftheredﬂagshediscussedwith
his star receiver when talking with Williams
about his future. I _

Now those ﬂags are waving and there’s

, no turning back. If theappeals court was to

rule.on April 19 or 20 in favor of the NFL
andimposeastayontheappeal,then_later
reverse that decision, the league has agreed

to conduct a supplemental’ draft for the -A
underclassmen within 10 days of the court _

order. - . _

In the meantime, the local Burger King-
is accepting applications. .

The two players knew well the danger‘ '
of what they were doing for mﬂlions, and

now might have the tables turned on them 4

thismonth.‘ ' . -

Comhusker makes switch to offense

MICHAEL BRUNTZ
Daily Nebraskan (U. Nebraska)

(U -WIRE) LINCOLN, Neb. —— When he steps up to the
line of scrimmage, Willie Amos’ mind is a mental train
wreck of plays and responsibilities.

Pass routes, blocking assignments, timing and tech-
nique have been force-fed to Amos since he made the
switch from comerback to wide receiver before spring

practice began.

“So far, for most parts, it’s going OK,” Amos said.
“It’s been a bit of a roller-coasterride. Of course, it’s a
different system, but it’s been a lot of thinking.”

Nebraska’s coaches approached Amos: over the
winter with the possibility of switching from defense to
offense. Amos said he didn’t feel pressured to make the

switch, and decided he could use his speed to his advan-

tage on the offensive end. ,
“It was a halfway issue between me and the coach-

es,” Amos said. “I thought about it and decided I wanted

totry it” v v -

Despite the crash course in offensive theory, this
spring has been a welcome departure from last spring,
when conﬁdence in his abilities was at an all-time low.
Amos came back last spring after tearing his right knee’s
anterior cruciate ligament and lateral collateral ligament
during 2002 spring practice. '

Amos said he wasn’t ready to come back and that
his conﬁdence and play suﬁered after also making the
switch to comerhack from safety last spring. A

“It was a really tough spring,” Amos said. “Coming

fresh oﬁ the injury, I don’t think I was physically ready .

to come back I don’t know if I was physically ready, and
my conﬁdence was pretty darn low. My abilities just

weren_’t what I was used to being at”

Amos appeared sparingly in 2003, playing in ﬁve
games and recording four tackles.

Junior wide receiver Ross Pilkington said he
thought Amos was making the position switch quickly
this spring. .

“The biggest thing that sticks out is his athleticism.
He’s made a pretty good transition already,”‘Pilkington
said. “I-Iisspeedisoneofthebestontheteammndlthink
that’s helping him out on the deep routes.”

The pain from Amos’ knee injury wasn’t left behind
at his old position, though He  receives daily treat-
ment, which requires a 20-minute sit in 60-degree water
—— something Amos calls the “Polar Bear Club.” He said
some cuts he makes on the football ﬁeld still bother his
knee, but he said his speed-is getting back to the way it
was when he was nmning a 4.45 second 40-yard dash.

“As far as speed before I was hurt, I don’t know,”
Amos said. “I would say I’m back up there. I’m pretty
close, if not past it. I want to get past that point. People
say I’m looking faster, but people looking and me feel
ing are two different things.” '

The new coaching staff also has Amos returning p
kickoﬂs this spring, though they,,haven’t said if the gig
will continueirlitlie £511.’ "’ ~ -- . — _ _

Amos said he still ﬁnds himself reverting back to '
techniques he used as acomerback. He said in practice a
few days ago, he turned to catch the ball but ran back
toward ﬂie ball like a comerback would. ' .

He said playing comerback was similar physically
to playing wide receiver, but the mental load was com-
pletely different ‘

“At receiver, as far as this system goes, all you’re
doing the whole time is just thinking,” Amos said. -'

Etatus as game’s best powerhitter enough reason to question

Madness, page 15

think that he might give one of
these substances to his athletes.

If said athlete has a great season
because of the trainer’s workout
program, wouldn’t the trainer be in
line for a bonus of some sort? So
then why not give your clients
something that will help them per-
form better.

The other reason is that Bonds
has gone from a skinny leadoff guy
to a bulky, 228-pound power hitter.

During his first seven seasons in
the Major Leagues, Bonds averaged
25 home runs a year. Before the

shrinking of ballparks, and the juic-
ing of baseballs, that’s notrat all a
bad number for a guy who was
bounced between the top spot in the
lineup and the cleanup spot during
that time period.

_ In the 11 years since then,
Bonds has averaged 44 home runs a
season. Included in that is the sin-
gle-season record of 73 that Bonds
set in 2001.

I’m not trying to take anything
away from that number. Whether
Bonds set that record through tons
of hard work or by pumping his
body full of illegal substances is
something that he personally has to

deal with.
Cheating has gone on in base-
ball foralmost as long- as the game

has existed. The 1919 Black Sox.

scandal is a good example of that.
There are even pitchers in the Hall
of Fame who were known to have
used any advantage they could
when taking the mound, “including
doctoring the ball.

‘ But it’s common sense that the
government would think that the

games’_ premier slugger might be"

using steroids, especially since
Bonds.’ next highest single-season
home run total is 49 — a high num-
ber, but nowhere near 73.

Added to that is the fact that
Bonds has had his four highest
home run totals in the last four

‘years a all afterhe had turned 35.
Not only is he the best power hitter _

in the game, Bonds is still doing it
as he closes in on the age of 40.

‘ Six years ago, Mark McGwire
broke Roger Maris’ ‘home run
record, belting 70 dingers in 1998.
If this were happening then,
McGwire would most likely be the
focus of I this investigation just
because he was the top slugger in

t the game.

And what would you know —
McGwire has admitted to using
Androstenedione, a dietary supple.-
ment that increases the level of
testosterone and is not, considered
an illegal substance. ‘

Fun fact —— Andro isn’t consid-
ered illegal because it is found in
Scotch pine trees, and that’s why it
is a dietary supplement.

All this doesn’t mean that
Bonds must have been using
steroids. There are reasons \to
believe thatghe isn’t, the main one

A ‘ being that he rarely misses a game.

In his 18-year career, Bonds has
averaged 142 games played each
year. With the exception of three
seasons, he has never played in
fewer than 130 games a season.
Players who use steroids tend to
break down quite often — see Jose
Canseco and Ken Caminiti..

The only definite way‘ to deter~
mine if he is using steroids is to
have Bonds take a drug test. But
whether he is or isn’t, Bonds should
realize why -one could think he
might be.

Joe Marchilena is the sports editor

of The Pitt News and he didn’t need
steroids to become the shape he is.

really national. The full U.S. national
team features players named Bocanegra,
Llamosa and Regis—pronounced RAY-
zhee, because he’s French! If an

American cheers for something Frenchh
Tom Ridge and John Ashcroft will per- A

sonally tap his or her phone in accor-
dance with the USA PATRIOT Act, so,
of course, no one will cheer for the soc-
cer team.
But enough about Freddy; I’m sure
he’ll do well. And if he doesn’t, we
-always have Michelle Wie — another 14
year old, another pituitary phenomenon.
Seriously, I’m about to sell my golf clubs
because I can’t swallow my pride enough
to accept I’m being out-driven by a girl.
Wie, more so than Anthony, James
or Adu, is most likely to succeed in her
sport because of the low risk of injury
and her not needing teammates to win. '-
She is already torching LPGA com-
petition as an amateur, and came closer
to making the cut in a men’s event than
either Annjka Sorenstam -— by consen-
sus, the best female player in the'world
— or Suzy Whaley — the only woman
who had any business in a men’s event,
because she actually qualified for it. Oh,
those tricky sponsor’s eiremptions.
When it comes down to it, though,
Wie, Adu, and the NBA rookies are just
part of a new generation of sports stars
—— they’re just getting an early start.
Anyone who worries about whether or
not they’re ready for the. spotlight needs
to stop. People said the same thing about
Moses Malone and Mario Lemieux, and
things turned out pretty well for them, I’d
say.
And really, what they’re doing is no
different from being a high school sports
star — except they’re in a really big
school district. And they get paid. A lot.
In fact, too much, but that’s a whole other
issue. ' -

Panthers take series with one-run win

Baseball, page 15

Boston College 4, Pitt 2 (10 innings)

In the second game of the double-
header at Trees Field, Boston College
left-hander Kevin Shepard cooled the
Panther hats off, allowing only two runs
on three hits over eight and one-third
innings of work as the Eagles earned the
split with the Panthers, 4-2, in 10
innings. ‘

In the bottom of the ninth, with one
out and the Panther’s trailing 2-1, Bryan
Spamer singled home P.J. Hiser to tie the
game at two. However, Mike Scanzano
grounded into a one-two—three double
play to end the threat and force extra
innings. '

In the top of. the 10th inning, the
Eagles plated two runs off Panther
reliever T.J. Gomati to secure the victory.

The Panther offensive attack was led
by sophomore center fielder Ben
Copeland, who had two singles in the
game, while Spamer added a triple.

“Overall, it was a good, solid day of
baseball. The second game could have
gone eitherﬂway,” said Jordano.

I Pitt 7, Boston College 6 v

The two teams braved freezing-cold
weather in the rubber game of the series
on Sunday afternoon, but the Panthers
were able to leave Trees Field with a_-

, warm feeling after beating the Eagles, 7-

6, to take the series, two games to one.
Scanzano singled home pinch-run-
ner Copeland with one out in the bottom
of the ninth to give the Panthers the vic-
tory after the Eagles had tied the game at
six in the top half of the ninth.
Hiser worked seven and one-third

_ innings, giving up seven hits and ﬁve

runs before giving way to the Panther
bullpen. Junior Eli Friedman picked up
his second victory of the season in relief.

Leading the offensive attack for the

- Panthers was Hiser, who had three hits,

including a solo home run and a double.
Freshman Peter Parise also had three hits
for. the Panthers.

In the bottom of the ninth, with the
game tied at six, Tom Cashman led off
with a single and was replaced on the
base paths by Copeland. After Copeland
stole second and Hiser struck out, Bryan
Spamer singled, moving Copeland to
third base and setting up Scanzano’s
heroics. .

“I am very pleased, because that is a
good baseball team,_’7 said Jordano. “Our
objective is to go out and win series, and
we have won our first two. Lam very
happy with the effort that we gave
today.”

The Panthers are back in action on
Tuesday, when they travel to take on
cross-town rival Duquesne. First pitch is
set for 3 p.m. ~
