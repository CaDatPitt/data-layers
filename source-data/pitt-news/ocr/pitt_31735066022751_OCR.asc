Complainants Allege Misuse of Newsletter

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer
Although the College of General
Studies election is over and the win-
ners have taken office, the Pitt
News has received copies of com-
plaint forms filed with the CGS
Elections Committee concerning

alleged violations of the "election"

rules committed by the .incumbent
winners of the election.

Three candidates, who allegedly
violated the rules, are Thomas Ha-
jduk, David Huffner and Cheryl
Tomko.

The complaints, fil_ed I by the
defeated candidates and their cam-

paign workers, in addition to two
candidates who won seats on coun-
cil, center on alleged misuse of
“The Forum,” the CGS student
cabinet’s newsletter sent out to the
students in CGS, stating that the in-
cumbents used _“The Forum.” as a
“campaign brochure” and that
libelous statements against William
H. Means, presidential candidate in
the election and the formereditor

of the Night Times, were published '

in “The Forum,” violating 1, 3 and
7 of the election rules. .

A decision was reached by the
CGS Elections Committee on Tues-
day evening, March 25, five days

The written decision reads as

“We found that ‘The Forum’ is
not libelous against any candidate
or in favor of incumbent candidate
members. ‘The Forum? was not us-
ed_ to further or defend anyone’s

The alleged misuse of __“T he
Forum” as a campaign brochure by
the incumbents would have encom-

election rules as defined by the Elec-

In response to faculty complaints

over the years concerning the
university’s Academic Integrity .

-Guidelines and Procedures, a
“Faculty Protection Study Group”

“was appointed 2 years ago to con-

stantly V review the in.tegrity
guidelines. At this month's Faculty
Assembly meeting, William Brown,
a chairperson of the study group,
recommended that the guidelines be
revis d to reduce student-faculty
confzcts, to protect the faculty, and

to ‘ ‘impart -institutional integrity. ’ ’ V

“The integrity guidelines’ are job-
oriented,” said Brown. “They were

' made to insure that the faculty

carry out their professional respon-
sibilities. ” '

Under recent recommendations
for the guidelines, administrators
will also be obliged under these
same principles.

’ “We see the present Integrity
guidelines failing in the instance of
student cheating,” said Brown. In-
stances of students suspected of
cheating have not been reported
because the faculty member may be
presented with a defamation suit by

’ the student. In such cases, the facul-

ty member would have to seek
his/her own legal counsel, said
Brown. ‘

services for faculty members who
are challenged should be apparent,
but the ﬁnal decision of whether or

not legal services should be provid-

report.

To reduce student-faculty con-
flict in such areas as cheating and
complaints on grades, the Faculty
Study Group said that the “inter-
position of a third party,” namely
the appropriate dean, should act as
arbitrator.

The ,Oakland Branch, of the
Mellon Bank (Fifth & Oakland)
was robbed yesterday at approx-
imately 1:10 p.m. The suspect,
described as a black male, ap-
proximately 35 years old, six
feet, 170 pounds, entered the
bank wearing a maroon wind-
breaker and yellow sweater, ac-
cording to city police and bank
officials.

Shortly after the robbery, the
Oakland branch was closed for
the afternoon, in order for the
bank to conduct an audit of its
books to determine how much
was stolen. Hudd Englehart, a
spokesman for Mellon Bank,
said $3477.78 was taken.
Englehart also confirmed from
an earlier-report that the suspect
made his escape in a late model,
brown Chrysler Cordoba.

the getaway car was allegedly a
taxi, which the suspect rode to

SGB president Bill Abraham,

“The most defendable portion is

Abraham said. “The same ra-
tionales. the SGB used when

Abraham said he would like to see

“I think a lot of people are feel-
ing threatened and insecure, and I
_. give the students more credit than

Abraham added.

Board member Walter Burke is
wary of increasing controls.

“I’m scared of the whole thing,”
Burke said. “Extra contr.ols...are

“Students should have the
chance to determine their own

that he did not like the ultimate veto
power given to-the vice chancellor
when the publications themselves
are not given the opportunity to
review that veto, or the person who
has the veto power. _
,He also said that he did not like
“experts” as voting members, and

the fact that -the media does not .

have the legal ability to select them.

“Their capacity as adviser is ﬁne,
but at public discussions, their
stigma of being ‘experts’. gives them
more weight and inhibits students’
idea,” Bertocchi said. He added
that out of six ‘student represen-
tatives on the Media and Publica-
tions Board, only two would be
[chose by students.

Scott Hendler also disagreed
with pertain points of the proposed

Racquet Tournament

To Benefit Falk Clinic A

By EILEEN KEN NEY

' Pitt News Staff Writer -
The first annual Jack Daniels

Parkinson Disease Racquet Tour-

. nament will swing into action Satur-

day, April 19 from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.
at the Monroeville Racquet Club.

The tournament will provide the
opportunity for tennisand racquet-
ball players to compete for
trophies, with proceeds to benefit
the Parkinson Disease Center
located at Pitt’s Falk Clinic.

“Our purpose is two-fold,” said
Harvey Daniels, fattomey and presi-
dent of the Jack Daniels Chapten
for the American Parkinson
Disease Association (APDA). “To
raise money and to publicize the
clinic—that there is help for Parkin-
son Disease victims. ,

Sports celebrities are slated to ap-
pear including Tony Dorsett,
Steeler Jack Lambert and Redskin
quarterback Joe Theisman. Local
tennis pros and state champion rac-
quetball players will be there and
members of the Steelers, Pirates,

Penguins,-Spirit, and the Duquesne _

Dukes havebeen invited.

The Pitt Panthers will be on the
scene and according to Daniels,
Jackie Sherrill “will deliver the en-
tire Pitt squad.” ,

Bill Currie, sportscaster for
WIIC-T.V, will emcee the tourna-
ment. '

The clinic, one of 17 Parkinson
Disease centers nationwide, first
opened August 22, 1979 and serves
Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia,
Maryland and New York.

According to Nancy Kosanovich,
nurse coordinator of the clinic,
medical treatment is only one ser-
vice the" center offers. It also pro-
vides monthly informational and
supportive family and patient group
meetings, guest speakers on various
subjects regarding‘ Parkinsons
Disease, refer_;al~ on physical and
speech -therapy, social services,
psychological support, and infor-
mation booklets and pamphlets free
of charge.

‘The Jack Daniels Chapter of the
APDA,‘ a lay group that helps to
support Parkinson Disease victims
and their families, was named after
Daniels’ father, who was a local
businessman and victim of Parkin-
son Disease. '

The disease is caused by a
"neurological disorder which is
neither hereditary nor contagious,
The substance dopamine, produced
by brain cells to regulate bodily
movement, is cut off for unknown
reasons. This results in three symp-
toms: a tremor, a slowness of move-

, ment, and stiffness, or rigidity 0

muscle movement. -
.“It’s a ‘democratic disease,’ ”
Kosandvich explains. “It’s no
respecter of religion, economic
status, sex or race.” She added that
it does occur most frequently in the

'77 “They misused ‘The Forum’; it

says everything good that they’ve
done,” she said. a

“It makes Bill Means look bad.
They made it sound like the staff
was abusing funds when we
weren’t,” Powell added.

The alleged libelous statements
from “the_ Forum,” according to
the complainant, read as follows:
——The‘publication has been plagued
by financial and production ‘pro-
blems, a lack of evening student in-
volvement, and low readership, and

—The Night Times ran out of

/ﬁirnoney, with four months left in the

fiscal year. 4 _ V

The first statementlis false, ac‘-
cording to Means, citing production
problems as being due,to the in-
cumbents not providing the Night
Times with equipment that was re-
quested. _ ‘

Means also stated that there was
approximately $1,200 left in the

- Night Times’ budget, but when he

resigned on January 31 to runfor
president of CGS Student Cabinet,

the cabinet decided to freeze the_

funding of the Night Times until an
editor was found. According to
Means, any financial requests must
be co-signed by bothlthe editor and
the CGS Cabinet president.

Means also argued against the
statement concerning a lack of even-
ing student involvement in the
paper.

“I feel we had more on the staff
this year than there has been in the
paper’s history,” Means said, citing

.about 20 people as working on the

paper at the time it shut down.
“Low readership was something
_that’s up in the air,” Means said.
‘‘It’s' hard to say if someone is,ac-
tually‘ reading the paper, but the en-
culation was up from 5,000 to 8,000
copies this year. As far as we know,
they were circulating.” ' _
Means said the second statement
about the Night Times “just wasn’t‘
true,.” because the paperwas not

out of money and still is-»not, accor-
ding to Means. I

“I wasrstoldgthat a lady wouldn’t
vote for me because she thought
I’m the person who screwed up the
Night Times. I feel people knew I
was the former editor and it had an
effect on my campaign,”
said. ' I.

The incumbents’ platform was
largely a “look what we’ve done”
campa/ign, according to Powell and
Means. ’ ‘ '

The decision of the Elections
committee was due to the fact that
there was no evidence in “The
Forum” that led anyone to believe
it was being used, to help inthe in-

cumbents’ campaign, according to _

Crytzer. __ V _

HARRISBURG—The owners of
Three Mile Island have proposedan
electricity conservation and
reallocation plan that - they say
should save customers‘ $1.2 billion
over the next 30 years.

General Public Utilities Corp.

, submitted the Zoogpﬁtge plan to the

Pennsylvania Public Utility Com-
mission and the New Jersey Board
of Public Utilities last week. ~
GPU’s three subsidiaries--,

Metropolitan Edison, PennsY1Va“ia
Electric and Jersey Central Power &'
Light—serve nearly 1.6 million
customers in the two states..

. «The utilities would reduce in-
vestmenfs in new generating plants

, and instead put themoney into

energy-saving equipment and other
means of checking electricity use.
“This alternate use of capital will

. mark a new direction for the electric‘

utility industry,” GPU said. “It,
the plan, can also serve as a model
for the rest of the nation.” --

The company believes the plan
will cut projected load growth in
half by 1990, allowing it to scrap
plans for three power plants-
scheduled for construction in the
late 1980s and the 19905.

The country «would save an
estimated 200 million barrels of im-
ported oil‘and environmental pollu-
tion would be reduced since a large‘,

  Carter Encouraged   g
 BOTH.-Sad!" Offer

By the Associated Press

To boos and shouts. from angry
countrymen, Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr offered
Tuesday _to take over custody of the
U.S. Embassy hostages, if the
United States agrees to a truce in its
war of words and economic ‘and
diplomatic pressure against Iran.

President Carter called it a
“positive development.” But like
so many other developments in the
150-day-old crisis, this latest turn of
Ajzvents was shrouded in uncertainty.
‘Any move appeared to be at least
two days away. <

The Carter administration
believes the hostages would be safer
in the government’s hands and that

-removing the militants from the pic-
ture would facilitate negotiations.

A spokesman for the Moslem
militants holding the’ embassy told
The Associated Press they were
“staying quiet” for now on whether
they would give up their 50
American’ captives to the Iranian
government. And revolutionary
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho-
meini also was silent.

Bani-Sadr made it clear that no
final resolution to the crisis was
near, saying no matter who has
custody of the hostages, they will be
freed only a_fter tl1_e_exiled Shah

Mohamed Reza Pahlavi is returned

Addressing a huge rally in
Tehran, Bani-Sadr said his govern-
ment would take custody of the
Americans if the Carter ad-
ministration pledged to
from “all propaganda or any claim
or statement or any provocation,”
until Iran’s‘new Parliament meets
to decide the hostages’ fate. Such a
Parliament debate may be months
away.

After Bani-Sadr’s address, Carter
met with his senior advisers at 5

a.m. in his Oval Office at the White 
‘House.

He then summoned
reporters, told them it was a
“positive development” and said he

.was deferring imposition of new '
economic sanctions and other’

punitive measures against Iran.

This seemed to meet part of Bani-
Sadr’s demand, but Carter added to

the uncertainty by appearing to stop »

short of making the kind of blanket
pledge the Iranian president sought.
A, White House,‘ ‘ official

. nonetheless said “indications” were

that the Iranian government would
“move expeditiously” toward ob-
taining control of the hostages.
Carter acknowledged he had no

guarantees .

The-selection'of Dr. Roy’Chipman as head basket-

record of 226 wins and 83 losses.

. However, speculation still continues as to whether.
Pitt will make a stronger committment to its basket-.

If you can g'et thislsystem work-
ing,‘ you can force stu/dent media to
treat the administration favorably.-
You won’t have to put up with any

2. Controlithe media budgets:
If media don’t behave the way you
want, you .mal_<e”it' clear tO~the of-
ficers that they won’t get the money
they need ..tO operate theway they
want..‘.which they won’t be able to
do anyway./' This has the adva_ntage'
of being less. visible, except around
the time-budgets are discussed. Of

course, the chief officers will _con-.

stantly feel it. If some uppity
rep.oiter' wants to complaiii about
dorm rules, his editor will certainly
remind him that’ he’s biting the

‘handvthat feeds him.

We’re still dealing with a fairly
obvious form ‘of censorship. It’s
possible to be insidious. S ‘

3. . Appoint media officers: This
is pretty sneaky, if properly ap-
plied. It appears you’ve picked

students who re qualified‘ for their

posts. Of course, it’s important
you leave,’ the qualifications v_aglie.
You need“ to find students who
understand the university cannot be
criticized.

It willcertainly be an honor to be
chosen to run one of ‘the media.
Therefore, the officers will cooper-
ate out of gratitude. On the other
hand, they’re still students, so it will

'. look like the media are still in the

hands of the student body.

You give the board the powers

especially effective, since it would
appear that the ‘media are absolute-
ly in the students’ hands. Few peo-
ple realize the administration can

don't even need to use this

"‘Wrlter Warns Student Government of Impending Doom? I

Dear Student Government Board
,Members:

As a student, I was involved in
electing you, and in your struggles
for power you have slapped me in
the face. How very pompous you all
must be to think that just because
you are the Student Government
Board that "you can select who will
be the leaders of the standing com-
mittees. Mere approval of the
gggcted leaders was not enough.
You needed to have total control.

Well, you fools, don’t you see
what you have done? You have
started the dominos on their way.
Now the administration is going to
slap you in the face. And you don’t

have a leg to stand on because you

have paved the way for them. C
If the vice chancellor approves
the media proposal to appoint the
leaders and officers of the media
groups, then who is next? SGB? I
don’t doubt it. Your heads will
surely be on the blocks soon.
You have no respect for the rights
‘of others or yourselves. Why
shouldn't the members of student

~ organizations select who they want

for their officers. Is it not their right
to ‘do so? Moreover wouldn’t the
person appointed owe his selection
to the SGB? What has happened to
democracy? Is patronage going to
win over merit?

Board members, I beg of you,
look closely at what you are doing.
Think of the consequences, they are
happening now before your very
eyes. You will restrict activities so
that more apathy will be created. As
student leaders who worked hard to
be elected, you should fight for
your rights to keep this valuable

freedom. You should not let the ad- /

ministration force you to accept
something you really don’t want.
Or do you want it? Do you want
them to be able to say well these
eight -. docile students will be the
SGB, and this complacent person

I will be the editor of the Pitt News?

You owe it to your supporters and
fellow students to stop the dominos
now.

I want to correct one inaccuracy

in your Story on March 28 on the ,

Architectural Studies Program: the
planned review of the program was
never canceled; I postponed the

review until the question of the ,

directorship was settled. The review
will be conducted this spring.

I recognize that the motives for
administrative actions are always
subject to varying interpretation. I
would like to say that my own

primary concern was to protect the ,

interests of students in the program
so far as the rigors of our present
financial situation permitted.

Validity of

  Registration

I do hope the readers of The Pitt
News will stand my patience, if I

continue the debate on ..the validity

of the need for registration and/or
the draft. In my letter of March 21,
I stated that many of the arguments
against the draft were founded on a
bad grasp of political science. Now
last Friday a Mr. Bob Friday wrote
in to rebut my article only, I feel, to
not only prove my point on the mat-
ter but reveal a bad grasp of history
as well.

In all fairness, Mr. Friday's letter
was better written than the one that
he wrote printed opposite mine of
March‘ 21, which was about as
coherent as a tirade from one of the
bag ladies on Forbes. He notes all
my .arguments for the draft; but

then he counteracts with an irrele-'

vant counterargument, 6r shows
that he missed the point entirely.

He starts by saying that my
argument—that U.S. drafts have
always come after the wars ‘have
begun——by stating that the Korean
War does not belong in the same
class as the two world wars. What is
the point of that, Mr. Friday? The
Korea draft, like the other two, still
took place after the war began,
didn’t it?

Then, worse,_ he states that we
lost nothing by entering WW 11
late. Well, we very well could have.
It was Germany’s strategy to keep
America isolated and at peace until
it could deal with us separately.

Born into the elite of families that

government officials, many of them
have built successful careers in real

__tion has won them, the families of

_ the barrio enjoy luxuries that very

children enjoy amenities like keys to

mediately branded Fidel Castro a
“comfnunist” and worked to
undermine his ' regime’ in every
possible way. Although Castro
made a few attempts to reach an ac-
commodation with the United

States, the State Department ig-'
nored this and eventually forced‘

Castro——never a serious Marxist-
into the Soviet camp of the cold
war. ‘

Carter and Cyrus Vance embark-
ed on a new course for Latin

American relations _when they
allowed the revolution against
Anastasio Somoza to run its course
without American intervention.

Since then the present administra-
tion has continued this course with
the condemnation of the military
regimes of Argentina, Chile and
Uruguay in a State Department
report, and a speech by William

Leuro, the United States’ am-_i

bassador to‘ Venezuela, which
declared that the United States no

longer would give aid to dictatorial
regimes in Latin America. '

A’ Apparently, this . chan/ge. results
from the realization among Carter’s
foreign policy advisors that unfail-

ing support of the status quo‘

throughout this continent only

guarantees postponement of the
eventual clash between the ‘rich
elites and oppressed poor. In this

case," an enlightened Latin

American foreign policy must work"

of Poverty 

for moderate change to alleviate the
poverty and oppression that exists.

‘The ultimate test for this policy
shift would havebeen in Nicaragua
and El Salvador, but any success in
these two nations has been stymied
by the decision of a joint committee
of Congress. In its attempt to
design a compromise foreign aid
bill, the committee decided to freeze
$75 million in reconstruction aid for

‘ Nicaragua, and $5 million,for the

Civil-Military Junta of El Salvador.

While part of the reason for this-{Zr

action is an attempt to control the

federal budget, it also seems to be i

the work of Republicans and con-
servative, Democrats, living in the
fantasy world of La Paz, who
believe that aid to these two nations
will help make" them “other
Cubas.” Ignoring the obvious
popular discontent in Nicaragua

and El Salvador, these congressmen ;

have convinced themselves that the
only problem is the leftist govern-

ments that are trying to correct cen- .

turies of injustice. Their mistaken
logic is that if the United States
choked these regimes to death,
everything would return to happy
normalcy. ‘
Congress could reconsiderthis

_ decision in its-next session and ap-

prove the aid for Nicaragua and El
Salvador. If it does not, the

governments of these nations can be

expected to look elsewhere for aid,
a possibility the United States can-
not afford. More importantly,
failure to reverse the freezeon the

‘ ajd would demonstrate‘ that the

United States is irrevocably on the
side of the status quo in’ Latin
America.“ The old Indian in the bar-
rio La Paz, slobbering in his soup,
shows the latent danger of such an
outcome. i

Improved Service Should Follow Increasein Health Fee

vices. Most. students get coverage

’ undertheir parent’s hospitalization‘

policies. These students don’t need
the health services because they can
receive treatment right across the
street, from their parent’s policies.

Another crucial problem is the
fact that after paying the health fee
students can not receive treatment
on the weekends so they either
resort A to suffereing the whole
weekend or go to a nearby hospital
and get no use out of the money
they have put into the health ser-

The above plight is not at all un-‘

several people who have been
through this, including myself.

 Validity of Draft Registration

(Continued from page 7)

for long-—-remember Hannibal?)
and keep quite an impressive army,
equal to 30 Soviet divisions, at the
ready, knives and all. And if
Sweden’s armed forces are indeed
more of a charitable than military
institution, why is Sweden’s air
force one of the largest in the
world? _

Then Mr. Friday cites the Pen-
tagon Papers as a contradiction that
“the Presidents, not the Pentagon,

ggnake the wars.“ Sorry, Mr. Friday,
"but my argument still stands. The
military hardly “controls the infor-
‘ mation” that goes to the President,
but gives him one side of the story,
one that will be obviously covered
from a military viewpoint. Our
failure in Vietnam was not due to
purely military factors; but mainly
due to a failure to observe deeper
social factors, a failure which has
been evident in many areas of our
foreign policy. We have civilian
control over our military to keep

the military angle in perspective; if .

we fail to do so, it is the President

who bears the major responsibility.

Remember how Clemenceau said,

“Wars are too important totbe left

to generals?” It is still up to us to
' make sure they are.

Mr. Friday follows that with a

blooper that makes the other

historical slips seem small. He states
‘ that MacArthur in 1950 crossed the

Yalu, thereby invading China, and

triggering the Chinese intervention, _

before being relieved. Where did he

_ get this? MacArthur was relieved
for suggesting publicly that we .

should _attack Chinese bases from

.the air—-and only after the Chinese A

intervention. As for the inference

that Korea,was"caused’ by the U.S. A

milita.ry—-—well, I suggest you do
some more research.

But at
counterargument ‘Mr. Friday
depicts my letter as stating that the
future is dark, and using un-
necessary scare. We, no, Mr. Fri-
day, I don’t have a crystal ball. And
maybe the future isn’t dark. »

But the Mideast is there, and so is
our dependence on oil. I felt that I
should inform as to the factors in-
volved. Again I don’t feel we have a
birthright to anybody’s' oil, but we
do have the right to defend any
countries who want to sell us it free-
ly. The Mideast situation cannot be
dismissed lightly, as you would like
to. ‘

I don’t make much of Iran, but
you do. You, like many others, still
think the point at issue is America’s

imagined right to interfere in Iran-‘

ian politics, and not the sanctity of
international law. I agree, how Iran

runs its people is not our business. '

However, they are holding 50 of
our citizens prisoner, in a move
declared illegal by the World Court.
And if Iran really wanted the Shah
so bad, why did they cut off our oil
only after they. took the embassy
hostage? It seems even Iranians are
not above sublimating principles
for a few bucks.

' You apparently take the view-

. point that freedom will be won

when “the. Iranian government
takes control” of the situation.
Well, they have control; but now
that they know we’re not going to
do anything‘, Iran is wondering how

. much they can get from us. But to

underscore the impotence of
military ‘vacilation as opposed to
the notorious willingness to use
power, has Iran taken over the
Soviet embassy? As point of con-
trast, if France found assylum for
Richard Nixon and -England invad-
ed and took over Mexico, whose
embassy would you want to take
over? I hope you’re willing to wait
for return of the hostages. Time will
tell, Mr. Friday, but Khomeini’ will

never want to be seen as a soft-liner.

\

But in your final paragraph your
niavete comes out in full ﬂower.
You state that the Soviet weapons
are defensive? If -they’re defensive,
why are there an inordinate number
of tanks, rocket launchers, pontoon
bridges, nerve gas launchers—all
defensive weaponry, as military ex-
perts can tell you-stationed with
the Soviet Forces/DDR? Why does
Soviet doctrine continually em-
phasize offense and surprise? Why

are defensive measures only being

taken in West Germany? It is ob-
vious that the Soviets don’t intend
to fight on their land. And, without
a draft, we won’tihave the land-
power to contain the Soviets,
should they, for whatever reason,
decide to hold the May Day parade

.in Bonn next year. Let’s hope it

doesn’t happen, but the potential IS
there. ‘

The thing you said about the
Soviet Empire are somewhat cor-
rect; it is an amalagation of unwill-
ing peoples. It is very comparible to
the Austro-Hungarian Empire of
1914. And when that Empire found
itself on the point of dissolution,
what did it do? It opted for an of-
fensive war-on Serbia—thus' begin-
ning WW I.

Now I don’t know i. Soviet
Moslem dissatisfaction drove
Russia to invade. Afganistan. But
whether it did or didn’t, the inva-
sion is an offensive undertaking, at

wrote in the other week pedal-
ing—that the Soviets were asked in
by a small intra-party clique to de-
fend against ‘heroin pushers’ (the
most racist thing‘The Pitt News has
ever published). This explanation
would give almost any country a
right to invade any other, anytime.

The question ’ then becomes;
don’t we have a right to defend,
say, our European allies from such
ventures? And, do we or do we not

have the right to institute a draft to ‘

enable us to do so?
In conclusion, and to answer

your final quiery, why I am not in V

the Army, the answer is, I am. I’m a

reservist officer. And while I missed:

Vietman, and admittedly am’ glad
for it, I have been to Europe and
Israel. The factors in both are dif-
ferent from each other, and both
very different than Vietnam.

Neither area is in love with ,the ,

U.S., but they don’t want to be
lightly written off either, especially
those who- rely on slogans and
second-hand knowledge rather than

clear thinking and. unbiased ,

"research. And while I’m-not in love
with the Army always (I wish they’d
let me have a beard) I feel enough in
touch with the ‘outside world’~ to
know your vision of unvarnished
political goods and bads and secret
conspiracies is a simplistic and even-
tually unworkable formulation 0

current affairs. ‘

_ DALLAS—,The "executive board

 the .Major League Players
Association voted Tuesday to
cancel the remaining exhibition
games but agreed to open the 1980
season on time,,delaying possible
strike action until May 22.

Marvin Miller, executive director
of the players associatation,» an-
nounced'the decision after two
hours of meetings with the player
representatives. ' .

“The executive board'- decided

, unanimously‘ that after today no ex-

hibitions will be played,” Miller
said. “In one last goodfaith effort

they are willing to open the season
and negotiate in good faith to reach

“If an agreement is not reached I

by midnight, May 22, a strike‘ will
begin on Friday, “May 23,” Miller
said. ‘ ‘ _

The decision did not’ affect ex-

which remained before opening

number was a lucrative_ freeway

Tuesday’s decision followed 20
weeks of what Miller described as

fruitless negotiations. ‘ ‘Their

‘Chipman was asked about how
he, felt to be only the fifth or sixth

. candidate for the job. He respond-
ed by saying, “There’s only one
coach at the University of Pitts-
burgh and that's me. That's the on-
ly thing Pm concerned about. The

' job will be a challenge for me.”

The situation with Sam Clancy is
also still up in the air. Chipman has
no firm commitment from Clancy
about leaving football in time for

-basketball practice. He hopes to
iron it out with Pitt’s star in the
future, At this point, however,

By MIKE DICHLARA
L .~\ss"r srvms Editor

The Pitt tennis team scored its
first win of the swson by defeating
Duquesne by a score of ‘I-2. The
victory made the team record 1-6
for the season and shows the
possibility of the Panthers turning

things around.
b In the first singles match, Pitt’s
Kevin Quay easily handled the
Dukes’ Ri Acri by a score of 6-4,
6-2. That was followed by Panther
‘Tom Liebenguth upending Mark
Iierch of Duquesne by a score of
6-3, 6-3. These first two victories

. gave the team some much needed

« conﬁdence for the remainder of the

' ,3 match. This was also the first time
"' this year the Panthers ever led dur-

ingamatch.
Pitt made it three matches . to

 none when Doug White defeated
’ Mike Levi 6-3, 7-6. This was one of

_ only two close_ matches on the day
‘inwhich Pitt was victorious. ’
Duquesne broke the Panthers

,,  string when Hal Joseph beat Chuck
‘ s _ Brand very convincingly 6-0, 6-3.

The score for the entire match was
3-1 "Pitt, with two more singles

Clancy is not his primary concern.
It's a decision that Clancy has to
deal with and Chipman hopes to be
able to help him with it.

“I feel that Sam will play (basket-
ball) next year. That’s the way I
feel. But I have no guarantee,”
said Chipman. ,

When asked if he would allow
Clancy to play half of the season,
he said, “l‘ll have to deal with that
at a later time."

Chipman then spoke about ‘his
goals for the program.

“I expect to be very competitive
within a 4-to-5 year period. We
want to be close to parity with foot-

scheduled. The Panthers needed at ‘
least to split them to enter the
doubles part of the match with a

, comfortable lead. The fifth singles

match was won by Pitt ‘s Joe
Mayers as he beat Lenny
Kamoroski 6-2, I-6. The final

ball. We want to be considered top
20 and beyond. I’m commited to
that,” he said.

Chipman’s coaching philosophy
was questioned as well as the condi-
tion of the present team.

“We_have four starters back, to
begin with. Tim (Grgurich) was an
excellent defensive coach. That is a
strong point. Our immediate needs
are a shooting forward and a good,
big man (center),” he said.

Chipman continued, “We will be
a running team. Fans like to see ac-
tion so it will be something we’ll be
involved with. We will run multiple
defenses, put ‘pressure on op-

ponents and try to control the
tempo of the game. ' I'm more con-
cerned about team basketball. I’ve
never had people who scored 25-30
points per game. We'll use 8 or 9
players in games to develop a strong
bench.” ’

He was also asked about his first
year budget and he said that he will
have 4 or 5 scholarships available.
However, he made it clear that all
may not be used.

‘fl won’t use them (scholarships)
if a kid is not a ‘quality player. I will
not give them out just to give them
out,” he said.»

  -Tennis Team Wins First, Look Impressive Over

Second doubles paired White and
Wagner for Pitt against Acri and
Joseph for Duquesne. The Panthers
were not to be headed as they, too,
won easily 6-4, 6-2.

Begins  .Iob In Country’

In his closing remarks, Chipman

reiterated how no one could be hapiﬁ

pier to be at Pitt. He intends to
work hard and anybody who works
for him will be expected to do the
same. He also stated how he hoped
that the situation (referring to the
fuss made over Grgurich) would die
down and things would get back to
normal.

defeat of Duquesne’s Bowes and
Levi.

Coach George Dieffenbach said
afterwards,-“It was our first win of
the season. The kids played well
and showed a lot of improvement.”

Trillo Hopes To Retum To Form For Phillies

CLEARWATER, Fl.a.-Phila-
delphia manager Dallas Green ex-
pects the “real” Manny Trillo to
play second base for the Phillies this
year, not the guy who had a season
with more ups and downs than a yo-
yo. .
True, Trillo won his first Gold
Glove in almost six years of major
league ball, but he missed 40 games
after being hit in the forearm on

‘May 3 in a game against Los

Angeles. He was hitting .303 at the
time. When he came back, his‘bat-
ting stroke was somewhere in his
native Venezuela. 9 '
Trillo, obtained by the Phillies
last spring in an eight-player deal,
ralliedin September to hit .316. He
ﬁnished at .260 but it was too late.
The injury-\riddled Phillies were out

of _ the National League East’ race.
Despite Trillo’_s injury, his'defen-
s‘ive performance in 118 games
enabled him to win the Gold Glove
over New York’s Doug Flynn and
the Dodgers’ Davey Lopes.

Green explained n that the
164-pound Trillo is not a very
strong guy basically, and needs
everything going for him to per-
form offensively. The fracture in
the forearm was disastrous to the
infielder and the club. 1

“Trillo hurried back. too quickly
from the injury,” Green admitted.
“I don’t ‘think he was really
sound. . .until September.”

Green, a manager who pulls no

punches, says he really didn’t think '

Trillo should have won the Gold
Glove. On: the other hand, the

manager is convinced Larry Bowa,
not Cincinnati’s Dave Concepcion,
earned the honor at shortshop.

“I think the Gold Glove should
go to a guy who is a 162-game guy,
who on paper that year won the
thing hands down,’,’ Green
declared.

How did Trillo feel about all this?

“It really was
season,” said Trillo. “I wanted to
show what kind of trade the Phillies
made for me. The beginning was so
good...Then I break my arm and I
lose my swing for another month.”

Trillo felt that despite the unex-
pécted Gold Glove award he
cheated the fans.

' “I really didn’t get the chance to
show the people what kind of ball
player I really am,” said Trillo at

a frustrating c

the Phillies’ spring training camp.
“.1 didn’t get the chance to prove
how good a deal they make.”
Trillo said he was surprised ‘with
the Gold Glove award, but noted
that things have a wayof evening
out. He noted that there were years
when he felt he should have won the
honor-and didnft because a Joe
Morgan was around, and Morgan’s
all-around performance, including
offense, overshadowed Trillo’s

‘ glove. »
“Right now, you don’t get the .

Gold Glove because of your glove,
but what kind of overall season you
have,”-Trillo noted. \ M

Trillo is going to bat second for
the Phillies, and with Pete Rose
1eadin8»0ff you can ‘expect a lot of
hit and run tactics.
