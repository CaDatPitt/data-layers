The face and size of Oakland’s Pitt
campus will be changing thanks to the
$70 million grant from Governor
Robert P. Casey’s Higher Education
Capital Construction Program.

The HECCP is a part of Casey’s $2
billion “Operation Jump Start Capital
Investment Program.” This program, by
using state bonds and university cost
sharing, will finance 66 construction
projects in Pennsylvania totalling near-
ly $468 million, according to Pitt’s
Director of Commonwealth Relations
Dennis P. McManus.

Three construction projects at Pitt are
in the immediate planning stage. A
number of others are considered medi-

Gathered on the steps of

um or long-term projects.

On Dec. 7, the Professional Selection
Committee developed a list of archi-
tects for some the projects. The final
selection for architects was made in
Harrisburg, according to McManus.
-Hillman Library addition. Architects:
Damianos, Brown and Andrews.

An area of approximately 40,000
gross square feet will be added to the
existing Hillman Library building to
accommodate the book collection,
reading and study areas, offices, etc.

“The main priority right now, accord-
ing to the provost’s office, is the library
expansion,” Professor Thomas
Anderson, Plant Utilization and
Planning Committee chair, said.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursda , Jan

Defining problem is first step in curing loneliness

n my last column I
wrote about the prob-

lem of loneliness and.

suggested that those of you
who are feeling lonely
begin to identify those per-
sonal traits that may be
contributing to your prob-
lem. If you can clearly
define them you have taken
the first step toward chang-
ing your life.

The next step is to devel-
op a strategy for change.
The strategies, of course,
will vary depending on the

problems you identify.
These may include, for
example, a planned

increase in social activities
accomplished by joining
clubs or volunteering
through an organization
such as the YMCA to help
other people; or it may
involve taking an assertive-
ness training class, partici-
pating in a social skills
group or seeking some per-
sonal counseling.

While all these activities

provide an active response
to the loneliness problem,
it is important to recognize
that a more certain way out
of the problem is to
become more self—accept-
ing. Almost every lonely
person I have counseled
has had self-esteem prob-
lems. Generally the low

that it is their own lack of
self-appreciation that
shapes how others view
them.

For those who have stud-
ied this problem, it has
become almost a truism that
people who dislike them-
selves have a very difficult
time getting other people to

quently, lonely people are
not aware of how their own
self-deprecating behavior
contributes to their feelings
of isolation. They believe
that other people don’t like
them but ignore the reality

rejecting behavior and
increase behavior that is
more self—affirming.

There are many good sug-
gestions for how to do this
in books such as Shyness
by Phil Zimbardo, and

Intimate Connect-ions by
David Burns and for an
understanding of the poten-
tially creative aspects of
loneliness read Loneliness
by Clark Moustakas. (All
available in the Counseling
Center Library, 534 WPU.)
Counseling is also available
for those who feel the need
for professional assistance.

Giving up this self-critical
style is not enough by itself
to make a significant
improvement in our feel-
ings of self-worth. Real
change in self-esteem
comes form the choices we
make, the values we devel-
op and the competencies
we strive for as we move
through our lives. Giving
up self—punishing ways of
thinking, however, frees up
the energy we need to live
our lives better. As we
make progress with this,
and feel more comfortable
with ourselves also, the
loneliness problem will
take care of itself.

Hypnotist to give talk

in William Pitt Union

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

“I intend to show people
something about their
minds, not just answer the
question, ‘What is hypno-
sis?’ We’re going to show
people how their heads
work.”

According to Al
Fitzpatrick, psychologist,

lecturer, hypnotist and
guest of the Self-
Knowledge Symposium

(SKS), this is what he wants
to accomplish at Pitt on
Thursday. He will be giving

eral years ago. With the aid
of books and “some help
here and there” he became
a proficient hypnotist. But
Fitzpatrick said that he is
not coming to Pitt to baffle
the audience as a stage
hypnotist. He is a frequent
speaker for SKS and
explained that the goal of
the organization, as well as
his visit, is to help students
discover greater self-knowl-
edge and help them come
up with answers to the “big
questions” such as “What is
of value?” “What is real?”

GPSA will fight future trans portation/ security fee

By Peter Oppelt
For The Pitt News

Graduate students have
put on their boxing gloves
and are warming up to fight:
the $30 fee for the new
shuttle bus/security system
that students will begin to
pay in the fall.

In December of 1992,
Pitt’s Board of Trustees
passed the
transportation/security pro-
posal, which resulted in the
$30 fee for full—time stu-
dents and $12 fee for part-
time students.

Last night the Graduate
and Professional Student
Association voted unani-
mously to protest the fee to
the Board of Trustees.

“It galls me we’re paying
to drive undergrads up and
down to Sutherland Hall,”
GPSA President Steve Parks
said, referring to one of the
new shuttles that exclusive-
ly serves the newly-built
undergraduate dormitory.

The system established
shuttles serving North and
South Oakland, Sutherland
Hall and an inner-campus
shuttle supplementing the
campus bus, parking shut-
tles and van-call service.

The GPSA will propose
graduate students using a
pay-as-you-go service that
will be available to faculty

and staff members using the

shuttle. Only students using
the service would pay the
fee under this guideline.

Mark Smith, the GPSA
Student Advocate, ques-
tioned the faculty and staff
arrangement saying, “If
they’re getting the pay-as-
you—go system, why are stu-
dents not getting this
option?”

The GPSA proposal ques-
tioned the convenience of
the system since many grad-
uate students do not live on
campus.

“The shuttle covers FIJI’s
[fraternity house] on
Wallingford Street, but what
about Bloomfield, East
Liberty and the Hill? How
does the university define
on- and off-campus?” Smith
said.

“Why aren’t they going to
the other side of the

Boulevard of the Allies
where a lot of students
live?”

Smith said he is studying
student demographics to
determine the shuttle’s rele-
vance for grad students. “If
we’re not getting conve-
nience, why pay for it?” he
said.

M. Serena Spenser, who
chairs the GPSA Safety
Committee, said,
“Considering the‘ vehemence
of responses gotten formally
and informally, the general
response is negative.”

GPSA’s newsletter solicit-
ed comments on the service
and received irate responses
saying “Protest! Protest!
Protest!”, “Petition this
atrocity” and “If we’re going

to pay for this we should
also band together to help
pay for my PAT pass!”

A Student Activity fee
increase from the current
rate of $7 to $10 for full-
time students and from
$3.50 to $5 for part—time
students was also proposed
by the GPSA board last
night.

Last year the GPSA was
allotted $2,500 to pay its
president’s tuition, but
Parks declined the money,
placing it instead into the
GPSA’s general budget.

This money will not be
available next year, and the
GPSA has voted to dramati-
cally increase its activities,
hence the proposed fee
increase.

Formerly called the Jewish

ments that need more space.
It has not been decided
exactly what or who will go
into the “new” building.

This 15,000—seat facility
will be for a variety of activ-
ities including basketball
games, track meets, concerts
and commencement exercis-
es. ,

This is the tough one
according to Anderson,
because it will require liter-
ally “acres” of space. “The
problem is where to put it.”
-WPIC Children and Youth
Center. Architects: Burt, Hill,

This facility, of approxi-

is meant to house 13 child

that are presently scattered
throughout Oakland.
-Safety system upgrades.
Architects: Baker and

Associates.

An upgrade of safety sys-
tems on a number of build-
ings. The upgrade includes
new automatic fire alarms,
sprinkler and emergency
generating systems and a
modernized central security
system.

Other possible renovations

being discussed for the
future are: -
-Alumni Hall/Chemistry

buildings. Outdated building
systems in Alumni Hall will
be replaced and Alumni Hall
will be connected to the
Chemistry Building with a
30,000 square foot structure.
-Trees Hall. Renovation will

include the installation of an

air conditioning system
which Trees Hall currently
lacks.

A number of construction
projects are also being
planned for the branch cam-
puses.

with clinical psychology
in graduate school at the
University of Akron,
Fitzpatrick spent a year
working at a maximum
security prison in West
Virginia, then gave it up
and went into private
business.

“I think it actually
freed me from the bur-
den of academic rigors
that limit the intuitional
and the inspirational.
You’re more motivated
to keep jobs, produce
figures and publish [in
academia]. When they
talk about research it’s
always in the laboratory,
and the things that are
not in textbooks about
ourselves are the most
important,” Fitzpatrick
said.

He added that, “A whole
area of psychology is
falling through the
cracks. It is being missed
and always has been.”

Fitzpatrick focuses his
demonstration on col-
lege students, because in
his view, students have
more open, clear and
dynamic minds. “They
aren’t tied down yet,” he
said.

“I want to stir up their
thinking — all the
notions that they have
about themselves, all the
nuances, sensory per-
ception, free will and
the whole idea of mem-
ories and access to
memories,” he said. “I’m
going to challenge them
with hypnosis, and take
it step by step, answer-
ing questions.”

success, and we plan to contin-
ue this in the future.”

As a token of appreciation to
O’Connor ASP purchased a brick
with his name to join those of
alumni. The bricks are being
used to build a walkway to the
School of Phannacy.

Joanne Fiamma, the vice pres-
ident of ASP in charge of coordi-
nating Pharmacy Week, said she
is thrilled with the success so far.

“The purpose is to join stu-
dents and faculty in both educa-
tional and social activities. We
have planned a myriad of events
and hope that everyone will
continue to make the time to
participate,” Fiamma said.

Each day this week there will
be booths on the fourth ﬂoor in
Scaife Hall sponsored by differ-
ent organizations to promote
awareness in many areas.
Information on diabetes, AIDS,
epilepsy, the importance of
donating blood, substance abuse
and organ donation can be
obtained at the booths. The
booths are accessible to every-
one on campus and aren’t only
set up for pharmacy students.

There are also booths which
may only be of interest to phar-
macy students. There was a
booth on Drug Trivia which test-

ed dmg identification, usage and
side effects.

Today, there is a Drug Expo
which is an opportunity for stu-
dents and faculty to interact with
the phamiaceutical industry per-
sonnel. It’s a chance for students
to become more familiar with
the most commonly prescribed
and newest drugs on the mar-
ket. Prizes and refreshments will
be available. It is being held at
402 Salk Hall.

As for the social side of
Pharmacy Week, there was
bowling at Miracle Lanes in
Monroeville and a Movie Night
at Scaife Hall. Instead of charg-
ing money for admittance, they
charged canned goods. All the
donations will be given to a
local food shelter.

Tonight is Ice Skating Night at
Schenley Park where skate
rental and hot chocolate are
free. The only charge is a $1.50
entrance fee.

The grand ﬁnale is the formal
to be held at the Sheraton in
Station Square on Saturday
evening. There is an award pre-
sentation to honor the
Distinguished Student and
Faculty Member of the year.

From the moment President Clinton nominated
her to take over the Attorney General’s office, Zoe
Baird has been met with speculation. Public interest
groups complained that Ms. Baird was a career-long
corporate lawyer who would take an agenda of big
business into the highest ranking law enforcement
office in the country if confirmed. _

Furthermore, she had very little criminal justice
experience, and as the nation’s number one police
officer, her ability to run this office was immediate-
ly questioned.

Even her apparent core group constituents,
Democrats and women, were questioning her nomi-
nation. Democrats argued that she backed and
fought to limit civil damage suits. \X/omen’s groups
wondered whether Clinton had nominated the
“right” person, an argument that he later deemed
hypocritical of certain women’s groups.

As if questions about her qualifications weren’t
enough, then came accusations that Baird and her
husband, Yale professor Paul Gewirtz, had illegally
employed a Peruvian couple to work in their home._

On Tuesday, during her confirmation hearings
before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Baird
acknowledged that she had in fact knowingly broke
the law. She did not attempt to pay the couple’s
Social Security taxes until after she was selected by
Clinton. Although she apologized to the senators for
her misconduct, the remark contradicts earlier state-
ments that she and Clinton transition officials made
after the disclosures late last week.

Initially, Baird sought to deflect the situation upon
her husband, who she claimed was responsible for
the couple’s hiring. Clinton officials said they
thought Baird was following the law because she
was applying for citizenship for the couple.

On Tuesday, Baird deﬂected the criticism by high-
lighting herself as a woman who was juggling
careers as a mother and as the senior lawyer of
insurance conglomerate Aetna.

The appointment of Baird met with scrutiny from
almost everyone (ironically enough with the excep-
tion of few Republicans). Various women’s groups
and Democratic politicians opposed her for her
somewhat right wing leanings. On this point we‘
have to disagree with the opposition to her
appointment as attorney general.

The question as to whether or not Baird should be
appointed to this post should not depend on her
stances on certain issues but on her qualifications
for the job. She knowingly broke the law by hiring
two illegal aliens, plain and simple. If confirmed
can we expect Baird to uphold the integrity neces-
sary to serve in this position? Past actions dictate
that we can’t.

Pitt fans a discredit to university

You wouldn’t have seen
or heard it on television, but
if you were at the Seton
Hall game you couldn’t have
missed it. It wasn’t' a pretty
shot or a thunderous dunk,
it was an out-and-out dis-
grace, one of which most
did not even give a second
thought.

Throughout the game,
from warm—ups to the final
shot, every time that Seton
Hall point guard Danny
Hurley touched the ball the
Pitt Student Section, the
“Field ‘House Fanatics” if
you will, chanted. And some
bigot held a sign that read
one of the most odious
phrases to resound through
Fitzgerald Field House
in a long time: “Hurley’s a
fag.” "

These aren’t manners that
I’m bringing into question,
it’s a little more serious than
that. I’m also not telling you
that Hurley is not a big boy
and that a few words from
an expectedly hostile crowd
will send him weeping in
the corner. »

What I’m questioning is
the integrity of the Pitt stu-
dent body. How important
can a basketball game be
when we resort to
such brazen defamatory
statements to excite the
arena? _

I was told by a friend that
it was our responsibility as a
student body to do every-
thing in our power to fire
up the team and the crowd.

.If having to resort to this

simple and blatant name-
calling is my responsibility,
then please exclude me
from participating.

Most of us have had to

deal with a false rumor cir-
culating through a room or
a school at one time of our
lives, and those moments of
suspicion and doubt are

 

Jason
Brame

horrifying. But to have 6,700
people, minusva handful of
Pirate fans, thundering such
an outwardly slanderous
epith_et down at you is
unthinkable and extremely
scary.

We don’t realize that even
though he might be a fea-
ture on an ESPN spot or in
The Sporting News, Hurley is
simply a college student, no
different than you or I. And
these words, harmless as
they may seem, do not
slide off of his back as
simply as “Hurley sucks”
might.

In the Jan. 11 Sports
Illustrated, Rick Reilly, in
his “Point After” column,
poses the question “who
killed sportsmanship in this
country?”

“Was it fans like Arizona
State’s, who in 1988 taunted
Arizona’s Steve Kerr with

chants of ‘P-L-O!’ after
Kerr’s father had been
assassinated by terrorists
in Beirut?” Reilly wrote.

Or was it fans like
Pittsburgh’s, who in ‘93
chanted “Hurley’s a fag” at
Seton Hall point guard
Danny Hurley, capitalizing
on unsubstantiated rumors
of his homosexuality.

’ This campus is supposed
to be one of enlightenment,
an environment in which
minorities can relish free-
doms that they might not
receive in the “real world.”
How can we sit here
and consider ourselves
anything but bigots after
what happened Saturday
night? '

We can only hope that the
individuals who ignited the
chant will not only refrain
from further abominations
but also act a little more tol-
erantly toward those with
whom they do not agree or
sympathize?

As for ourselves, we must
ask how we could let such
an outwardly disdainful
expression permeate our
beloved field house.

I was thrilled to see
Garrick Thomas drain the

three to win the game for ‘

the Panthers. But I would
have been equally satisfied
had it been Danny Hurley
who had beaten the
Panthers with a last-second
shot, and then run past the
student section and into the
locker room, quietly and
dignified, possessing all of
the class with which he
plays the game.

Not even Blonde Ambition can help this Body Of Evidence

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

Early on in Body Of Evidence, a young
boy asks his father whether it’s possible to
really screw someone to death. This, of
course, becomes the foundation for the
latest film to cast Madonna as a leading
lady.

The fact that the audience doesn’t learn
until much later that the boy belongs to
Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe) is only
one of the blatant intricacies that the filin-
makers have failed to address in the film.
It’s so poorly written and directed that the
continual plot failures don’t become tire-
some, they turn amusing.

Also, no one in the film acts very pro-
fessional, turning it into a haze of sex and
violence, atypical of this erotic genre that
Hollywood has spawned and continues to
breathe life into. This one is a problem
child.

Director Uli Edel, who cinematically
mined Hubert Selby Jr.’s gripping novel

Last Exit To Brooklyn, doesn’t concern
himself with Film School 101 in this effort.
Instead he just takes things for granted.
The film twists and turns constantly, stop-
ping only for some heavy petting
between Madonna’s hellcat character,
Rebecca Carlson, and Dafoe’s lollipop
lawyer sketch.

Edel is in such a hurry that we are
never fully introduced to characters. It is
only minutes into the film that Dafoe,
who has agreed to represent Madonna, is
on a first name, enter—my—house-at—will
basis with her.

It seems that Madonna has a problem
with older men. She likes ‘em rich and
with wobbly hearts, but open minds. The
film opens with her lover, Andrew Marsh,
lying on the bed of his sprawling man-
sion, eyes gazing at a pornographic home

tape running in the VCR. He’s dead of

course, but the whether it was the sex,
the cocaine, the secretary (Anne Archer)
or Madonna who did him in, the film
wants you to think about it.

The trial scenes become nothing more
than answers to the film's questions. We
learn of people’s places and relationships
in quick exchanges between the District
Attorney (Ioe Montegna) and Dafoe. The
witnesses who are brought forth only add
facts about Madonna’s past. The jury and
spectators in the gallery appeared more
surprised than I when new twists and
developments were brought forth. Maybe
it’s the genre that the film is working in,
but for a thriller, there was little suspense
as to the outcome of the verdict.

Basic law procedures are thrown to the
wind, adding to the film’s phony pose.
The admission of tape-recorded evidence,
the recalling of a witness, who was previ-
ously discredited, by the prosecution and
various other nuances make for court-
room scenes that are amateurish in detail
and make the film jokish.

There is never any discussion between
the lawyers to let you grasp how the trial
is going, and new witnesses appear out of
thin air with outlandish tales, only to

"What's Next" for the

retract them later. Accepting this premise,
I realized it was time to scrap the thriller
part and looked for the eroticism.

But even that becomes hokey. Dafoe
and Madonna get it on in outrageous
positions, with outrageous props and
places for no other reason than to have
sex. Their is a faint buildup to their erotic
relationship, but it’s done over Madonna’s
childhood memory about picking straw-
berries as a youth. It may be metaphoric
in context, but Madonna is anything but
Virginal here. Burns, deep gashes and
wax are supposed to highlight the free-
wheelin’ sexual attitude of the pair, but
become ridiculous toys.

At no point is this effort ever decent or
disciplined. After an ex-lover of
Madonna’s testifies with harmful evidence
against her, Dafoe acts like a jealous lover
rather than a lawyer. “Why didn’t you tell
me?” he asks her. But the question is
more about her lovers than relevant to the
case. “You owe me the chance to

Sun Ra and his Astro Infinity Arkestra

My Brother, The Wind Volume 2

Evidence Records

Since the start of his musical career in the late 19405,
Sun Ra (born Herman “Sonny” Blount) has bridged the

gap between different styles of jazz music. His various’

big bands, or “Arkestras,” combined the lush sounds of
Duke Ellington with melodic experimentations like
eastern modals scales long before musicians flirted
with such styles.

Not only does the Arkestra not sound like other big
bands, it doesn’t look like any others either‘? The group
dresses in space costumes, including helmets with
flashing lights. Ra even claims he was born on the
planet Saturn. He frequently incorporates outer space
into song titles and moods.

In the past few years Evidence, a fledgling jazz label,
reissued eight CD5 and now, two new CDs of albums
originally released on the Sun Ra’s own Saturn label.
The material has been impossible to find for years.

One disc combines two albums recorded early in the
Ra’s career and serves as an excellent introduction to
his music for any newcomers. The other may be
reserved mainly for Sun Ra fanatics.

The first disc, which combines two albums, Sun Ra
Visits Planet Earth and Interstellar Low Ways, was
recorded in the late ‘SOS, when the Arkestra was rela-
tively young and a fixture the Chicago jazz scene.

Ra’s musical arrangements at this time were based on
a combination of big band and his own unique con-
cepts. By superimposing one chord on top of another,
the instruments create a haunting, dissonant sound on
songs like “Overtones of China.” Timpani solos,
unheard of in jazz before or since then, appear in sev-
eral tunes. They fit in with the music rather than
sounding like a novelty.

“Two Tones” features the dual baritone saxophones
of Charles Davis and Pat Patrick leading the melody.
This thick, low timbre appears in several tunes and
became an integral part of the Arkestra sound. Patrick,
and saxophonists Marshall Allen and John Gilmore are
still members of the Arkestra to this day.

On Interstellar, outer space became a big part of the
Arkestra, as each of the seven songs feature some idea

On Pointe by Michelle
For The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Dance Council
has become the mother of excit-
ing and new modern dance
companies by nurturing local tal-
ent and consistently bringing
energetic dance companies from
around the country and abroad
to Pittsburgh.

For their “What’s Next” series,
which are artists considered on
the cutting edge, The Victoria
Marks Dance Company will per-
fOI’lTl what is described by dance
critics as “intelligent, powerful,
inventive and emotional.”

The company will perform a
new work, “This Way In,” which
premiered Oct. 15 and 16 in
Boston and Nov. 20 and 21 at
New York City’s Dance Theatre
Workshop. The dance deals with
stories from the. Bible’s Book of
Genesis, which explores issues
of gender and power.

“This Way In" was developed
through Marks’ past residencies
in Pittsburgh, including work-
shops at Point Park College,

, downtown.

Ms. Marks, or “Vicky,” is doing
another residency in Pittsburgh
leading up to her company’s
performance at Eddy Theatre, on
-the Chatham College campus,
Jan. 22 and 23. She led a lecture
and demonstration at the
Dance Alloy in Oakland on Jan.
18.

The workshop was principally
for local dancers and choreogra-
phers to exchange ideas, get
feedback and to network,
“Because often when we do res-
idencies, we don’t get the
opportunity to meet with the
local dance community,” Marks
said.

She invited-the choreogra-
phers and dancers who attended

Continued from page S-1
explain,” she pleads. Again, it’s
not about the trial but about her
trying to cling to the relationship.

It’s not Madonna or Dafoe’s
fault that this is so pathetic.
Although it is inexcusable on
Dafoe’s part —— 'here’s an actor
who has carried charisma and
grace to previous roles, for not
realizing the disaster he was get-
ting into. He’s not the ideal suck-
er stud for Hollywood, but if
they can turn Daniel Day—Lewis
into a heartthrob, then anything
is possible.

Madonna never gets a chance
to do anything more than act
bitchy and seductive, roles she is

well-accustomed to. She never
looks stunning, though. A seri-
ous indication of how bad a
director Edel is.

His previous works have been
a plethora of Euro—trash doinks,
and with his first truly big—bud—
geted American script, he tries to
be slick. The camera uses glittery
shots of skyscrapers and boats
on wharfs as transition. In an
herbal medicine store, a cloudy
mist covers the screen, as if the
director were trying to make the
shop into a colonial—era apothe-
cary.

Strangest of all is the continual
haze that lurks during the court-
room scenes. It appears out of

place, as does the lighting during
the trial. When Madonna finally
takes the stand, the haze and
dullness of the screen is lifted
and her face is illuminated. If it’s
a telling sign of the film coming
into focus finally, it doesn’t
work. Some things in the past
just can’t be ﬁxed.

The moral at work deals with
evil, gold-digging women and
easy men who can’t resist a girl
with sex toys and a camera. No
gender or social group will be
happy with the portrayals, and
while vengeance serves a pur-
pose in Body Of Evidence, then
the vengeance is mine. Never an
Uli Edel film again.

relating to the universe.
Some, such as “Space Aura”
and “Onward,” have a fast,
boppish feel, while Others
are based On slow, simple
riffs.

The music fits well with
the titles. The hypnotic
“Somewhere in Space” is
built around two minor
chords, and as the band
plays behind him, Gilmore
plays a meditative, bluesy
solo creating the mood of
ﬂoating through space.

“Interplanetary Music” and
“Rocket Number Nine Take
Off For the Planet Venus”
have lyrics, mainly the title
repeated ad infinitum, sung
by members of the band.
Their low voices resemble
Tibetan Monks chanting
mantras, which was probably
the intention.

On both albums, Sun Ra
proves himself an able, if
understated, pianist. During
“Reflection in Blue” from
Planet Earth, he even shifts

   

Straight from Saturn to your Souler

from acoustic piano to elec-
tric piano without slowing or
interrupting his solo. The
entire CD serves as a water-
shed between Sun Ra’s roots
and the new path he started

    

system. Mr. Sun Ra.
forging with his music. It’s a
fascinating document which

contains some brilliant
music.

Unfortunately, the same
cannot be said for My

Brother, The Wind Volume 2.
Recorded between 1969 and
1970, the album features
some musical experiments
that were prevalent at that
time. While some of the
tunes are very good, the
album as a whole comes Off
uneven and a bit self-indul-
gent at times.

When the album was
made, the state of jazz was
as disorganized as the state
of the country. Funky Organ
trios were popular all Over
the country. Free jazz, which
often consisted of wailing,
squealing horn players, was
attracting a young crowd in
New York and infuriating the
older crowd. All this can be
heard in My Brother.

The opening 9 cut,
“Otherness Blue,” features Ra
playing a straight blues piece
on the Organ. In front of him
Alejandro Blake does a
Miles-Davis-in-outer—space
solo, leading into Marshall
Allen wailing and squealing
on alto sax. On “Contrast,”

Ra forgoes the rhythm sec-
tion and plays freely by him-
self, while Allen, this time
on oboe, and Patrick sepa-
rately provide the noisy con-
trast to their leader.

Two of the songs are
marred by the vocals ofjune
Tyson. Unlike the vocals on
the previous disc, which
blended with the music,
these lyrics are sophomoric
(“They’ve both been walk-
ing/ walking/’ walking on the
moon/ if you wake up
now/it wOn’t be too soon”)
and detract from the music.

To make things worse, five
of the 11 tracks consist sole-
ly of Sun Ra doodling on an
early version of a moog syn-
thesizer. At the time of My
Brothers release, this might
have sounded like a great
leap forward in the Ra—Man’s
journey toward outer space,
but today it sounds like
another ‘60s experiment
gone bad. There are several
high points on My Brother,

which I always favored any-
how.

50 Happy Together,
released On the fledgling
Sonic label out Of Chicago,
combines elements Of Seep-
ing familiarity with the sub-
conscious ballsiness of the
aforementioned rock thing.
Snatches of familiarity fade
in and Out Of recognition
until the duped listener finds
himself playing an idiotic
kind Of “Name That Tune”
with phrasings that recall
other “undie” hits. Just as
Sonic Youth bit Dinosaur Jr.
with “Eliminator Jr.” and
Rapeman ripped the Youth
with “Kim GOrdOn’S Panties,”
the Grifters seem to incorpo-
rate off-kilter riffs Of uniden-
tifiable notables (suspicions
are heightened when one
hears “Daydream Riot” on
The Kingdom ofjones EP).
Plagiarism is a tricky thing
and underrated to boot.

The first cut, “Dry Bones,”
is roughly a minute and a
half tight groove escalating,
intensifying and finally cli-
maxing in a discordant wash
Of noise, then subtly
regrouping around the Cary
Numanesque drone of
“HATE.”

Slippery guitar buzzing
and farting, are structurally
determined by snippets of

white noise, low mixed
mumbled dialogues and
other mysterious sound

sources, Camouflaging tempo
and key Changes until the
insidious notion that several
songs comprise the whole,
as On “Clot.”

Yeah, so I’m saying there’s
a sweetness to the impene-
trability Of the thing. Every
listen sounds different, or
rather, new secrets bubble to
the surface every time, much
like a Thinking Fellers’ LP,
or the whispered nothings of
a Slint song. More fun than a
Rubik’s Cube.

New runners lead women's track in Ohio

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

First—year students made their
presence known on the Pitt
won1en’s indoor track team on
Saturday, and their performance
was one that the Pitt record
books will not soon forget.

Najuma Fletcher and Tonia
Malloy, both first—year students,
set new records for Pitt at the
Ohio State Invitational; Pitt’s first
full team competition of the
year. Fletcher, Malloy and class-
mate Tanya Mullins qualiﬁed to
compete in the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
competition (ECACS), the
regional track competition for
the Northeast. Yet another first-
year student, Natasha Van Reil,
placed third in her event for the
Panthers.

Fletcher leaped past a Pitt
record with a tripl-; ‘Limp of 39-
9.75. Her jump was good for a
fourth place finish at the meet.
She took first place in the high
jump while matching the Pitt
record she set on Dec. 12 of this
season.

“I was very happy with my
performance, especially the
triple jump,” Fletcher said.” It
was definitely one of my best
perfomiances for Pitt.”

Don’t be too quick to pack
away the record books, howev-
er. According to Pitt track Coach
Steve Lewis, Fletcher “by no
means had her greatest day.” In
fact, Lewis was not as surprised
by Fletcher’s record as he was
by the event in which she did it.

“She never competed in the
triple jump before,” Lewis said.
“I’m looking forward to her
upcoming performances
because she has four years to
improve upon these numbers.”

Malloy broke the record in
the 600—n1eter run and set the
new mark at 1:34.76, good for a
first place finish at the meet.
Malloy, who also took third
place in the mile run, said that
being a first-year runner gives
her an advantage.

“I like the fact that I can go
into a race without facing high
expectations,” Malloy said.
“There was no pressure on me,
and I think that helps.”

There was pressure, however,
on the experienced Panthers.
Faced with leading a young
team set back by injuries, the
upperclass students demonstrat-
ed that there is no shortage of
talent at the older end of the
track squad.

Senior Allison Williams,
already an ECAC and NCAA

division qualifier in the 55-meter
hurdles, took first place in that
event. Sophomore Stacy Suggs
and junior Kim Blair also quali-
fied for ECACs in the event,
placing fourth and sixth respec-
tively.

Joanne Warner, a senior who
has recently been nagged by a
foot injury, placed third in shot-
put.

Senior Monica Hockaday took
second in the 600—meter run
(ECAC qualifier) and teamed 11p
with Mullins, Williams and Blair
to place second in the 4x400
relay.

“I’d say that Hockaday is the
anchor of our running team,”
Lewis said. “She is the glue, a
steady performer who will be
involved in any success we
have.”

Pitt finished with 80 points
and fourth place, but Lewis
pointed to the goals of this meet
beyond Pitt’s placement.

“We competed against very
good teams,” Lewis said. “We
weren’t looking to win as much
as we were looking to prepare
for this season. We are building
cohesiveness as a team and the
freshmen are getting experience
as college competitors. I’n1
looking forwanfto a good sea-
son.”

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

Besides strong passing and solid exe-
cution last night against Boston
College, the Pitt basketball team need-
ed a secret weapon — they needed a
Brush in the paint.

Brian Brush led Pitt in a inspired first-
half explosion
Panthers to come back from a 13-point
deficit and win their
third straight Big East
game, 81-70, at the
expense of a hot-

“When I come into
the game I try to
play good ‘D,”’ Brush
said. “I try to give

spark and let things
go from there.”

and scoring, Brush
was the catalyst for
the Panther turn-
around. His career
highs, 11 points and
nine rebounds, could not have come at

“I’m a senior and I take it upon
myself to calm everyone down,” Brush
and to get everyone to do

what Coach [Paul] Evans wants us to
do.”
I Pitt did settle down with 5:15 to go in
the first half. After a quick bucket by
Antoine Jones, Brush stole the ball and
fed it swiftly to Jerry McCullough, who
led Pitt with 22 points, for the deuce.
After two by Chris McNeal, the BC
lead was cut to 28-21. Junior Marlon
Rhymes followed Eagle guard Howard
Eisley’s free throw to nail a three and
dig further into the
Eagle lead, 29-24.

leader from Murraysville, Pa., said the pres-
sure was definitely there going into the
competition as the defending champion.

“There was more tension [than last yearl,”
Schake said. “Everybody was watching us
and wanted to see our routine since they
knew we won last year.”

Going after a second straight national
championship would be a difficult task for
any cheerleading squad, but it proved to be
an especially tough task for Pitt this year.

In addition to a rigorous practice sched-
ule that didn’t change even during finals

week, personal problems for many of the
squad members made preparation for the
competition especially tough. Two girls left
the team shortly before the event, and
another girl’s grandfather died just before
the competition.

“We had to completely revise and redo
the routine,” said Lauren Cypher, a first—year
cheerleader who is also from Murraysville.
“There were a lot of obstacles to over-
come.”

Cypher said she feels the squad’s success
and hard work is often underappreciated by
much of the student body.

“What makes me mad is that a lot of peo-
ple don’t consider cheerleading a sport,”
Cypher said. “But if theyfve ever been to
one of our practices then they know we

21. 1993

don’t just jump up and down and do cart-
wheels all night.”

Schake said she and the other members
often practice as many as 40 hours a week,
devoting a great deal of time to cheering for
a number of Pitt sports besides football and
men’s basketball.

But still, Schake said, the cheerleaders
suffer from a lack of appreciation.

“People don’t think of us as a sport, and
we don’t get recognized enough,” Schake
said. “We go to all these other functions that
all get funds and scholarships and money
and we don’t get anything for it, so that’s
kind of hard.”

For the Pitt cheerleaders, a second cham-
pionship in a row should make it all a little
bit easier.

Stock, the Pitt Hockey Club
had its offensive motor in
high gear on Sunday as it
scored seven goals against the
Blue Devils of Penn State-
West.

It’s just too bad the defen-
sive rnotor stalled out.

The opportunistic Devils
took advantage of a smorgas-
bord of Pitt penalties by scor-
ing five power-play goals on
their way to a 9-7 defeat of
the Panthers. I

The loss drops the Panthers
to 5-7 on the year (2-4 in
WPCHA). Through 10 games
this season, the Pitt offense
has continually come up big,
scoring an average of six
goals per contest. However, as
it was in Sunday’s slugfest,

“ defense has been the big
question mark for the
Panthers, as they have surren-
dered an absurd average of
6.7 goals per game.

“We definitely hurt our-
selves with penalties,” Hockey
Club President Mike Mahoney
said. “We gave up to many
two-on-ones and three—on-
ones . . we’re playing really
poor defense.”

Pitt got on the board first,
with Stock scoring the first of

tied the game with six min-
utes left in the period, when
Penn State’s Brian Davis
found a loose puck near the
left wing circle and wristed it
by Panther goalie Mark
D’Amico. The first period
ended with the score tied at 1-

Less than two minutes into
the second period, Pitt took
the lead back on Stock’s sec-

Pen Bmmsso

Gil Stein named Wayne Gretzky
to the all—star game because he
said Gretzky is what the fans want
to see.

Do the fans really want to see
Peter Sidorkiewicz of Ottawa
playing goal? This is the decision
that a panel of general managers
made by selecting Sidorkiewicz
and New Jersey's Craig Billington
as the back-up goalies to Patrick
Roy of Montreal. A name omitted
here is Tom Barrasso.

Banasso has been the league’s

Jim
Clark

best goalie this year. Naming
Sidorkiewicz over Barrasso is a
complete joke. Sidorkiewicz has
more losses than Banasso has in
league-leading wins.

Billington is having a good
year, but he’s not even a full—time
starter with the Devils. Banasso
was caught up in a numbers
game. One player from each team
must be selected, and
Sidorkiewicz and Billington are
the only players from their respec-
tive teams (Ottawa's Brad Marsh is
a senior selection, so he doesn't
count).

This system, as with the base-
ball all-star game, is stupid. An all-
star game should be for the best

Room 332 Cathedral of Learning

The Provost’s Advisory Committee for the Two-Block
Academic Complex will hold an open forum to provide an
opportunity for members of the University community to present
their requests for space within this new building which will be
constructed under the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Operation
Jump Start Program. It is intended to house academic and
administrative support programs including classrooms, offices, and
teaching laboratories. The building, which will be located on a site
bounded by Forbes Avenue, Oakland Avenue, Bouquet Street, and
Sennott Street, will have 90,000 to l00,000ft’ of usable space and is
estimated to be available in the Fall of 1996.

If you are interested in presenting a request for space in this new
building, or if you wish to comment about other proposed occupants
for the building, you should contact W. Richard Howe at Ext. 46090.
Presentations should be limited to 5 - 10 minutes and should be
accompanied by a formal written proposal.

Proposals should include a statement that justifies the
assignment of space in this building, a careful estimate of the
number and mix of persons to be housed, the amount of space
needed, and a description of the type of space requested (i.e. offices,
classrooms, laboratories, and any special requirements).

out of BC and sent the Panthers into
the locker room with all the momen-
turn.

The turnaround in the first half was
keyed by Pitt’s ability to step up the
defense with Brush and Gant.

“Well our defense picked up in the
second part of the first half,” Evans
said. “We ran our half—coi1rt offense
very well and took advantage of the
break.”

Evans said there was several players
who were responsible for the 19-to-five
run at the end of the first half.

“Jerry [McCullough] was key. He
played very well at the point,” Evans
said. “And Brian Brush may have had
one of the best games he has ever
had.”

In the second half, Pitt picked up
right where it left off —— continuing its
dominance with an eight-point run that
lengthened the lead to 42-33.

The Panthers finally got their inside
game going with nice passing from

tired Eagle front court.
Boston College would cut the
Panthers lead to two points three times

in the second half but could never tie »

the score. Blowing at least four

chances to even the game, the Eagles 
were outscored 14 to 11 in the final ._ 

five minutes.

The first half started with Boston '

College executing a perfect play on the

opening tip-off. Malcolm Huckaby dart—  - E

ed down the court for the easy lay-up
to give BC the early edge.
Playing without Gerrod Abram (out

due to injury) and a very cold center in  "

Curley, BC was lengthening its lead
against a sluggish Panther team.
With baskets by Huckaby (who led

all scorer’s with 24 points), Paul ,

Grant and Derek Jackson, the Eagles
extended their lead to 26-13 with 9:43

to play.

While the lead and the time dwin- A,
dled down, Evans inserted Brush and
Gant to help the inside woes of Pitt’s ‘

two big men, Mobley and McNeal.

McCullough, Rhymes and Thomas. With that move, Pitt started to play ..
Those passes, along with some good tough defense and sparked their way

Chris McNeal to hammer away at a get back into the contest.

pondering their strategical
misstep and stormed back
with four straight power—play
goals in a 10-minute span to
take a 5-2 lead.

Stock got the Panthers back
to within two with 45 seconds
left in the period when he
came down the slot on a two-
man advantage, took a feed
from centerman Bill Crousey
and notched his third goal of
the game to make it 5—3.

The Panthers came into the

third period like they were
shot out of a cannon, scoring
three goals in the first 48 sec-
onds of the period to take a 6-
5 lead.

After Devils defenseman Joe
Swingle tied the game halfway
through the final period, a
scary m.oment happened.
Panther defenseman Scott
Giordano was rammed heavily
into the left wing boards -
hard enough to knock the
penalty door wide open and
leave Giordano sprawled on

the ice for five full minutes.

He would eventually make
it to his feet and leave the ice
under the assistance of team-
mates Mahoney and Matt
White.

According to Mahoney,
Giordano received a hip injury
in the collision and is day-to-
day.

Less than two minutes after

play resumed, Penn State’s ‘

Steve Vinay gave the Devils a
7-6 lead on a blistering slap-
shot from between the circles.

Stock tied the game at 7-7
with his fourth and final goal,
but the Panther defense
couldn’t hold off the Devils’
attack as they scored two
goals in the final three min-
utes of the game to take home
the 9-7 victory.

The Panthers next WPCHA
game will be on Sunday when
they take on West Virginia in
Morgantown.
