\Villiam Angel, BA39.

The acceptance of these 18 men
brings the tot.al of new men in the
club to 45_ which, Robinsonpointed
out. is a far larger number of new
men than the club usually accepts.

Robinson has appointed Assistant
Manager Ross Garman, C38, and Wil-
liam Collins, C36, as a committee to
initiate pledge customs for the new
men. The new members are required
to wear tags on which are printed their
names a.t all. rehearsals. Further
initiation ceremonies are being pre-
pared.

Dr. Vl-Talter H. VVright, associate pro-
fessor of the School of Dentistry and
director of the club, announced Mon-
day evening that tryouts for the Var-
sity Male Quartet had been completed.
XVilliam Cover, C38, ﬁrst tenor, Eu-
gene Burkhart, C36, second tenor.
John Clark. C36, baritone, and Robert
Euwer, C36, bass, were chosen from
a. score of applicants.

With the exception of Cover, all the
men have been active in the club in
past years. Euwer, now entering his
second year of quartet work, is this
year’s manager; Clark was manager
during the 1933-34 season; Burkhart
has been assistant manager of the
club for three years, and is beginning
his third year of quartet activity.

Cover is a transfer student from
Kent State College, Ohio. He was
active during his ﬁrst year of college
in musical work.

The quartet has made several ap-
pearances already this year, using
members of last year’s group, which
included, in addition to Euwer and
Burkhart, Frank Engel, E38, and Jo-
seph Morley, BA35. Last evening the
quartet‘, appeared before a dinner
meeting of the Westmoreland County
Pitt Club, at the Latrobe Country

Group_X Forms
Discussion Clubs

Clausen, Franklin, Lohstoeter,
I-Iovde Selected As Leaders

Due to the popularity of the Group
X meetings headed by Dr. Bernard C.
Clausen, pastor of the First Baptist
Church, it has been thought advisable
to organize four new clubs that will
be known as the Group X Discussion
Clubs.

The new groups will be headed by
four persons well known to University
st.udents. The ﬁrst meeting of the
clubs will be on November 4, at 12:30
o’clock.

Group one will be headed by Dr. B.
J.-Hovde, associate professor of his-
tory. This club's discussion will cen-
ter around the subject of “VVorld
Peace,” as it inﬂuences college stu-
dents. This group will meet in Room
1 of the Y Hut.

Group two will be in charge of Dr.
J. M. Cotton, pastor of the VVa\'eI'l_.‘x’
Presbyterian Church. Talks in this
unit will deal with the everyday prob-
lems and decisions that the average
college student is up against in his
life at the University. This club will
meet in Room 2.

Dr. S. P. Franklin, head of the de-
partment of religious education at the
University, will head the third group
in a discussion of the subject, “Col-
lege and Religion.” Their club will
meet in Room 7D.

In charge of the last group will be
Dr. Lotte 0. Lohstoeter, associate pro-
fessor of modern languages, who will
talk and lead discussion on the ques-
tion of “Campus Standards.” This
club will meet in Room 6.

The student committee that will be
in charge of the new Group X consists
of ten members. The chairmen are
Jane Kahler, Ed37. and Chalmers
Brown, Ed37. Other members of the
committee include Geraldine Ashton,
Ed37. Carl Anderson. Ed36, Rosemai-_v

Crime. Ed37. Dorotl‘-Iv’ LOOSE, E037»
Natalie Rosen, Ed37. Willard Ross,
C33. l'lai'garr-.t Smith, Ed37. Olga

Shabatura. C37, and fvlarion Smiths

C36.

Those who wish to enroll in one of
these clubs should sign one of the
blanks that can be obtained at the Y
Hut or Heinz House. All those who
attend are asked to provide for their
lunch.

Newman Amateur Night

Tonight the Newman Club will hold
an'ama.teur night at 9 o’clock in the
Cathedral High School on Craig
Street, near Duquesne Gardens. A
social hour will follow the entertain-
ment. Admission will be 25 cents.

Work Lungs At Game,
Move Feet At: Dance

After the game tomorrow, de-
spite victory or defeat for the
Panthers, students may dance for
two hours in Heinz House by
courtesy of the senior class.

Admission will be 15 cents a
person. Sophomore women, how-
ever,are to attend free of charge,
as guests of the senior women.
Don Pa|mer’s Orchestra, will play.

Margaret Speer, Ed36, president
of the senior class, is chairman of
the dance committee.

S cIu—1_if_z Exults
As Bleyer Signs
For Sopbs’ Hop

Archie Bleyer and his popular Co-
lumbia Broadcasting System orches-
tra has been selected to play the tra-
ditionally formal Sophomore Hop.

Bleyer is one of the youngest of the
“name” maestros and has been called
the “stylist of modern dance music.”
He is reputed as one of America's fore-
most arrangers, and has done arrange-
ments for Rudy Vallee, Paul White-
man, and other headliners.

Walter VVincheu, ace commentator
on play-spots for the New York Daily
Mirror and a large syndicate, has this
to say of Bleyer"s music, “His orches-
tra eminates toe-tapping rhythms. If
you are a little dead, the brisk melo-
dies, combined with sweet ﬂowing
numbers, is like a. shot of adrenalin.”

The orchestra is composed of 12
versatile entertaining artists. Bleyer,
himself. is a composer of some note‘.
His “Mouthful of Jam,” “Messin
Around,” “Business in ‘F’,” and “More
Business in ‘F’ ” are among the finest
hot numbers ever composed, ranking
in that respect with “Tiger Rag.” Bley-
er’s hot music, however, is only used
for variety. “Sweet and Slow” tunes
are his main forte.

“For the night of November 8, we’ll
crowd the debutantes off the Twen-
tieth Century Club ballroom ﬂoor to
put over the biggest Soph Hop in
years.” This comment from D. C.
Schultz, BA, the dance chairman. At
any rate, this will be the ﬁrst class
dance ever held at the Twentieth Cen-
tury Club. located across from State
Hall at Bigelow Boulevard and Park-
man Avenue. Tickets will go on sale
today.—M. R.

; Is Panther Meat

- Lions’ New Diet?

Harry Henderson. Penn St.ate’s_£ru-
sadiug editor who runs The Collegian,
may possibly feel vindicated tomor-
row afternoon if the Lions from Cen-
tre County take a beatincz, from Pitt.

The lead story in the last issue of
The Collegian proclaims that an edi-
ltorial campaign to institute training
ftable for State gridders had ﬁnally
lbrought results, and now the erst-
{while starving Lion line and back-
lﬁeld men are eating two-squares per
tliem.

An acCon11)a113'ii.1g front page edito-
rial emphasizes that the new policy
of Penn Stal.e‘s Board of Athletic
Control is nothing more than a “de-
cent and progressive” attitude. and re-
lieves “intolerable conditions.”

But the question is. after only a few
days of regular meals. “Will State to-
morrow still be auaemic——should Hen-
derson’s editorials have been followed
more quickly?"

Even an army “travels on its belly.”
—C. B. H.

Tippetts, Hovde
Aid, Radio Forum

Speak, With Brookings’ Moulton,
On American Business Future

._.

Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean of the
School of Business Administration,
and Dr. B. J. Hovde, associate pro-
fessor of history, took part in the
“Radio Town Meeting” Tuesday night
over KDKA facilities.

The program is a purely extempor-
aneous affair, with no notes, no script,
no preparation. It conducts a weekly
discussion of affairs of the day by per-
sons well-informed on the speciﬁc
questions.

Dr. Harold G. Moulton, president of
Brookings Institution of Washington,
D. C. was the featured speaker 011 this
program. He commented on the topic
of the evening, “The Future of Amer-
ican Business,” and was then ques-
tioned by the other participants, Dr.
Tippetts, Dr. Hovde, Mr. Alfred Bing-
ham, editor of “Common Sense” maga-
_zine, and Mr. Jacob Margolis, L09,
Pittsburgh attorney and- father of
Fred Margolis, C36. Dr. Bernard C.
Clausen, pastor of the First Baptist
Church, was chairman of the broad-
cast.

The previous evening, Dr. Moulton
addressed a group of 300 Pittsburgh-
ers at the Hotel Schenley concerning a
recent survey conducted by his In-
stitution on “The reason for wa.nt in
the midst of plenty.” Presented by
the Falk Foundation, he suggested
two methods for achieving recovery:
increase of money wages without. the
proportionate increases of prices, or
reduction of prices without the corre-
sponding reduction in wages.

Coyne Is Praised
At Inquiry Forum

Little, County Treasurer ‘Nominee,
Substitutes For State Senator

Harry A. Little, former city coun-
cilman and present Republican candi-
date for county treasurer, “pinch-hit”
for State Senator James J. Coyne
Wednesday in the regularly sched-
uled meeting of Inquiry Forum in
Alumni Hall.

Senator Coyne, Mr. Little explained
at the beginning of his talk, was
called away to Harrisburg to attend
the lVlcNair “Ripper Bill” investiga-
tion and could not speak as he had
planned. He asked Mr. Little to
speak in his place.

Mr. Little’s talk centered chieﬂy

around a defense of Senator Coyne.
He claimed that Senator loyne has
been the victim of the attacks of a
certain downtown daily.
Senator Coyne, Mr.

Little main-

,,tained, has always been in favor of

social legislation. Some years ago,
according to Mr. Little, the Senator
presented an old age pensions bill in
the legislature which, after passing

both houses, was declared unconstitu-

tional by the State Supreme Court.

However, Senator Coyne did vote
against the discharge of the Senate
committee which was considering the
last old age pensions measure. For
him to vote for the discharge of the
committee would have been equivalent
to producing “chaos in the legis-
lature” because it would have meant
going against the traditional method
of reporting legislative measures to
the ﬂoor of the house.

Old age pensions must be taken
care of by an amendment to the state
constitution, Mr. Little affirmed, and
“Senator Coyne would vote for suc
an amendment.” "

The speaker pleaded that he was
talking 011 short notice and that he
hadn’t had time to prepare an ade-
quate talk. He asked permission of
the Forum to talk about the office of
county treasurer for which he is a
candidate.

He declared the fee system of the
delinquent tax oﬂice “obsolete” and
promised that should he be elected he
will appoint a man who will turn back
the excess amounts collected to the
treasury.

However, the audience was more
interested in Senator Coyne.

“Do you consider Senator Coyne’s
attitude favorable to social legisla-
tion as a whole?” a student asked
after the meeting had been turned
over to questioning by the audience.

“Yes,” answered Mr. Little, ‘'1
think his attitude is favorable.”
“Does Senator Coyne favor in-

creased corporation taxes?”

“I don't know what his attitude is.”
Mr. Little went on to explain that if
corporation taxes were increased they
would be liable to drive industry to
more "couservative” states.

House  Magic Arrives
On Campus Next Thursday

 

The startling and highly entertain-
ing demonstrations of the General
Electric exhibit at last year’s ‘World’s
Fair in Chicago will be brought to
Pittsburgli on Thursday, October 31,
for a University-sponsored assembly.

The ﬁrst showing at 11:30 in Me-
morial Hall, will be open to Engineer-
ing and Mines and science students
of the University, Dr. E. A. I-lolbrook,
dean of the Schools of E11gii1ee1'ing
and Mines, announced today.

Faculty members and the entire
student body will have an opportu-
nity to see the exhibit at 3 o’clock,
when science students of Schenlev
and Central Catholic high schools will
also be invited.

University classes will not be dis-
missed, however.

Herbert Du Val. Jr., of the General
Electric research laboratory in Schen-
ectady, will demonstrate the strobe-
scope. with its “motionless motion."
the sodium vapor lamp, audible sound
and visible sound, ultra-violet radia-
tions. the phototube or “electric eye,”
and the mysteries of high frequency
as shown by the inductotherm.

The experiments, Mr. Du Val prom-
ises. will be both practical and novel.
A lligh-frequency set in the form of
an inductotberm. which resembles a
miniature broadcasting station, will
be used by Mr. Du Val to show how
the effects of the artiﬁcial fever ma-

chine are utilized in the treatment of,
gway for maneuvers at the Pitt—Army
who absolutely:

disease.

The demonstrator.
denies that he is a magiciaii, will also
show that it is very simple to cause
light bulbs and glass tubes, not con-
nected to any current source. to light
up or darken by a wave of the hand.

The stroboscope. a rotating disc in
front of a flashing noon light, illus-
trates llOW rotating machines are
s1;u(lie(l for defects while traveling at
a. high rate of speed. I-low photo-
tubes and thyratons. “electric eyes,"
are combined to regulate illumination
or do other household tasks will also
be shown.

The demonstrations will conclude
with various ultra-violet ray experi-
ments, showing the various changes
in color schemes that may be effected
by the use of that ray.

ROTC Enlists Coed
Captains Today

Honorary coed captains for the
University ROTC corps will be

traditions of the Corps.

Jenninlggjléttends
Meeting At Kane
To Save Forests

Primeval forests and woodlands un-
touched by man were observed last
week by Dr. 0. E. Jennings, head of
the biology department, when he at-
tended a meeting of the advisory
committee of the Federal Forest Ex-
perimental Station in Kane, Pennsyl-
Vania.

The committee, consisting of botan-
ists, representatives of tanneries, pa-
per mills, and lumber companies as
well as state foresters from Pennsyl-
vania, Maryland, Delaware, and New
Jersey, met to study and discuss the
40,000 acres of primeval forest set
aside last spring by the Federal Gov-
ernment.

Located 20 miles south of Kane,
this forest 1a.nd is the same today as
it was in the days of Columbus. The
committee hopes that in the study oi’
nature’s ow11 methods of replanting
trees they can learn what part other
plants play in the process. For this
reason the committee has, aside from
the large tract, several experimental
lots of various types of primeval and
cut-over forest.

The purpose of all this research is
to ﬁnd the best methods of treating
the land so as to get the largest
amount of the best timber for indus-
trial use. Present methods of re-
forestation have, on the whole, proved
unsatisfactory.

New Department
Plans ‘Biology 1’

Coordinated Work May Combine
Overlapping Zoology, Botany

Speaking yesterday of the coming
merger of the botany and zoology de-
partments, Dr. 0. E. Jennings, new
head of the biology department, said
that there will be no change in the
courses olfercd by these departments
until next year.

Next fall the new biology depart-
ment, with Professor Jennings as its
head, will replace the present courses
in general botany and -zoology with
an introductory course in general
biology. This new course, according
to Professor Jennings, will eliminate
the overlapping of material that now
exists in the two courses, pa.rticular-
ly in regard to the study of heredity,

evolution, and physiological princi-
ples.
Dr. Jennings said that a union of

the botany and zoology departments
has long been hoped for by the ad-
ministrations of both the Carnegie
Museum and the University in that
It facilitates the use of the 1VIuseum’s
collections by University students.
Most large universities, he said, have
their own collections, and the near-
ness of the Museum makes its use
by University students desirable.

Bands men, Spell
Them Greetings!

Visitors from State College who
journey to Pittsburgh for the Penn
State game tomorrow will be treated
to a special display of maneuvers by
the 1210-piece Universit.y Band that
have been created for the occasion
by Captain Donald C. Tredennick,
drill director.

As the band enters the ﬁeld before
the game. it will spell out “Hello
Lions." Between halves the revolv-
ing “P” will be formed.

The band is-composed of 120 1ncm-
bers, including 35 clariuets. 34

trumpets, 17 saxophones, 11 drumsp,
10 trombones, ﬁve French horns, tivcg‘

tubas, two piccolos, baritones,
and one ﬂute.

Elaborate preparations are under

[\\'O

game, November 9. The band will
leave Friday, November 1 for Newf

York where they will represent Pitt
at Fordham the next day.

Fifth Hour Class
Abolition Voted

In SFA Meeting’

Pep Assembly Day Before Army 

 

Game Approved; Body Votes
To Investigate Cafeteria

“VVe strongly recommend the aboli-
tion.‘ of all University ﬁfth hour
classes.” the Student Faculty Assem-
bly decided at its monthly meeting
’l‘uesda_v evening.

Included in the motion for remov-
ing lunch-time sessions was a plan for
doing away with the present Friday
afternoon schedule. Under the pro-
posed :n'-rangenient, Friday sixth hour
would begin at 2 o’clock, instead of
2:40 as at present. Classes would
then continue until 6 o’clock.

So that “students may be able to
eat lunch before they graduate,” the
Assembly decided that a uniform open
hour each day should be arranged by
the Administration. Engineering rep
1‘esenlz=.ti\'r.-s showed that students in
the School of Engineering often have
solid schedules of eight and nine
hours. College proponents of ﬁfth-
hour abolition stressed the need for a
common meeting time for all students.

ROTC drill, under the plan, would
still begin at 1 o’clock on Friday, giv-
ing military men one-half hour for
lunch. Sixth hour classes would then
convene at the close of drill. Lois
Follansbee. C37, will present the idea.
to authorities.

Plan Pep Assembly

Edwin G. Lincoln, C37,
that the SFA take part in a peace as-
sembly on November 8. "The feder-
ation of collegiate Christian organiza-
tions is sponsoring peace meetings
throughout. the country just before
Armistice Day.” be said, “and perhaps
we should like to participate.”

Lincoln’s remarks gave someone an
idea. “Why not have a pep assembly
on that clay?” \Villiam Harvey. C36.
president of SFA, was asked. “That
is just: before the Army game,” the
assemblyman continued, “and seems
like a logical time for our annual pep
meeting.”

So the peace idea was passed over
without further ado, and Harvey, on
authorization of the Assembly, has ap-
pointed a pep assembly committee.
Louis Bearer, E37, is chairman. Other
members are Theodore W’. Biddle,
William Blair, BA37, J. Neff Wells,
C38. and Albert Treusch. C37.

Upon the motion of Roberta Nern,
Ed36, the group decided to conduct

its annual investigation of the Univer- ‘

sity cafeteria. Miss Nern will likely
be the chairman of the committee.
Chief argument for the move was,
“'.l‘here’s some reason why students
don’t eat at the cafeteria. We want
to ﬁnd out what the matter is.” The
committee was empowered also to see
whether the Cathedral could not in-
clude an eating place.

Charles Ebert, C36, was appointed
at the Executive Committee meeting
Wednesday to recommend the building
of steps behind Heinz House to the
top section of Alumni Hall drive.
Representatives of intrepid seniors
were not present to contest the move.

Florian Majcln-zak,‘ E37, was chosenr

SFA representative in the Student
Chest drive.

Chairman of the social committee,
Vvilliam McQuade, E37_ advised the
Assembly that new rules have been

adopted.

NewRiBody Meets
On Campus Today

Discussion Group Will Ask SEA
- For Charter Recognition Soon

A special meeting of the new social
a.nd economic discussion group, called
Student Alliance of the University of
Pittsburgh, will beheld today at 12:30
o'clock.

The new oi-:.::.i.niza.tion expects to
oifer a program of free discussion on
currelit national and world affairs
which affect student life. To keep
this frank and open discussion as non-
partisan as possible, the group will
not align itself with any oft‘-campus
organizations.

One of its objectives is to make the
students more conscious. to use a.
YMCA phrase, of the world they live
in. The theory behind the plan is
tliat only through developing interest
in public affairs will the student body
be able to participate intelligently in
these aﬂ‘airs‘in later life.

Another objective of the group, as
stated in a tentative form for char-
ter application. is to promote gen-
eral welfare and social 1lll(lf3l‘t<l.”.l')(llll.lg‘;‘
of students and faculty of the Univer-
sity.

Among‘ its policies are: clariﬁes.-
tion of the student’s relationship with

* the outside world; creation of interest

in campus service projects; elimina-
tion of discriminat.ion against miriorily
_.(:roups on campus; crystallization of
the sentiment of students for peace,
which at present exists in an l!l?ll'ilCll-
late form: and opposition to educa-

afrional intrenchment.
Sage. professor Ofl

.\lembership will be open to under-
;;-mcliiate. .‘%'l'1l(lll£1.l,(?. faculty and ad-
ministration members who subscribe
to the purpose of the group and who
will pay dues.

The new organization expects. to
present its charter sometime next
week to the Executive Committee of
SFA, Today’s meeting will feature a
discussion of the charter.

Lions Are Here Again

SAVORY SMELL of turkey and stuﬁings should cer-
tainly go with that Panther Lion battle at the. Sta-
dium tomorrow. For many, many years folks around
Pittsburgh considered the Pitt-State clash as much of :1
Thanksgiving Day ﬁxture as they did the cranberries
and pumpkin pie.
Although tomorrow isn't Thanksgiving, the State grid-
men will be here again and there are many to rejoice
that the Lions are back on the Pitt schedule.

Football fortunes at the Mt. Nittany school took it sud-
den drop several years ago, but a process of rebuilding
has resulted in a team which State supporters feel will
give the Panthers an interesting afternoon tomorrow.

If they do, it will only be in keeping with some rather
interesting happenings that have come up in connection
with meetings of these rivals.

Quite a. few years back there was a bit of fuss made
because the»State folks claimed that the Pitt people had
sprinkled a little water on Forbes Field so that ‘the Eight
and fast visiting backs would skid around in the mud.
After quite a bit of checking and testimony everyone
agreed that it was all a mistake and that melting snow
was responsible for the diﬁiculty.

Another time the ﬁeld was covered with snow and
only the labors of  husky crew of student shovelers al-
lowed the game to go on. Maybe it's just as well that
they have a tarpaulin up there at the Stadium to take
care of those things now.

“Sniff And Snort At Art”

N THE MIDST of the annual opinionated squabble
. , about the Carnegie International, we came upon what
we think is the sanest and broadest judgment of the Ex-
hibition yet voiced.

The man responsible for the judgment is the man re-
sponsible for the selection of the various paintings to be
hung up in the Art galferies, Homer Saint-Gaudens, di-
rector of the ﬁne arts department of Carnegie Institute.

"Says Mr. Saint-Gaudens, “All paintings need not be of
equal importance to all persons. In a word, we need
variegated art in galleries as we need variegated ani-
mals in zoos, if we wish to keep ourselves interested.

,‘_‘No one at my task thinks for a moment that the best
type of exhibition is a place where he may let his public
slide into slip-slop slumber by way of artistic opiate.”

Mr. Saint-Gaudens’ defense of Peter Blume’s "South of
Scranton,” theﬁrst prize winner last year, sounds to us
equally unbiased:

; “When the public sees anew form of art which it fails
to understand, the public resents that art, just as ri. horse
resents a wind-blown newspaper. However, if a portion
of that public can sniff and snort and ﬁnally discover
that-the object possesses a reason for existence, aes-
thetic or otherwise, that the object has both individual-
ity of expression and a modicum of honesty; then that
public will approach that object, timidly at ﬁrst, but
ultimately with real liking.”

The student public, we think, might well adopt the
practice of “s1iifﬁng” and “snorting” at its art. Then we
might have less of the annual squabble, when each one
tolerates no opinions but his own, and more of an open-
minded willingness to understand and a facility to share
in the artist’s experience.

We can't" restrain ourselves from calling to your at-
tention a further message from Mr. Saint-Gaudens. The
director pleads with the critics to “debunk” themselves,
a.nd asks that each critic “stop writing about his own
ego and start writing about the pictures before him for
the public around him.” S. H.

l, Editorial Of The Week I

You Answer
From The “Colgate Maroon”

S YOU RELAX so complacently in your soft luxur-
__ _ious easy chairs surrounded snugly by _the richest of
living.conditions, you are undoubtedly obsessed with the
perfection of it all. What a country this is; the richest
nation in the world. Nothing could possibly be wrong
with a system that has given you all these material
blessings. There is nothing you lack, ﬁne food, magni-
ﬁcent homes and clothes, yes of course the best and
most -stylish. You can laugh, dance, play. What do you
know about the struggles of life, and what is more do
you care? Civilization you think has reached its zenith.
Change capitalism? Don’t be ridiculous! Every one
has all they want, haven’t they?

Have they? The picture now changes rapidly. Fra-
ternity row with its mansions gives way to the slums of
New York City. Wretched conditions, holes of disease,
it is a wonder life can exist let alone grow. In 1929,
America had the last year of this great prosperity, yet
during that year one-fourth of the population lived in
slums. But this is the depression, how many more anil-
lions of families have been reduced to this last stage of
destitution?

But what is more important than a home is food.
People must be fed. In that richest year, 1929, three-
fourths of the families living in cities did not have
enough to eat . . . if there is anything worse than being
killed outright it is this slow, torturing, starvation. Only
one in ten had the amount to eat you had. And then
again this is not 1929; it is the depression.

These ﬁgures are from “Rich Man, Poor Man,” by
Chase, Fairchild, and Overstreet.

Change this system, don't be ridiculous. It is too bad
that conditions like this exist, but after all it is their
own fault. They were not rugged enough to get to the
top the way we did. The ﬁttest survive, so if they are
not as ﬁt as we are let them die. It really is too bad
and as Christians we must say we are sorry. But after
all we are satisﬁed and that’s what really counts, isn't
it? . . IS IT?

Judges Look Too
Much Into Past,
Declares Smith

Common Pleas Jurist Suggests
That Rationalization Replaces
Originality On Bench

“We judges, as a whole, have come
to rationalize too much,” Judge Ralph
H. Smith of Common Pleas Court told
his audience at the John Marshall
Club smoker, Tuesday evening.

“VVe look for opinions of the past,”
Judge Smith added, “in order to qual-
ify our opinions of the present. It is
always easier to yell slogans and cite
decisions of the John Marshalls and
Roger Taneys than to be original,” he
added.

The judge ﬁrst reviewed for his
audience the duties of a Common
Pleas court judge in courts of equity,
contract, criminal court, and in the
Common Pleas court itself.

“Law is a living, growing thing,
and although precedent plays a big
part in these decisions, the combined
backgrounds play a big part in their
opinions,” Judge Smith claimed as
he veered to a comment on the four-
to-ﬁve decisions of the Supreme
Court. He suggested that the eco-
nomic, social, political, and philoso-
phical backgrounds of the men should
be considered when criticizing their
actions.

“VVe have temporarily adopted de-
cisions of the Supreme Court,” he
added, “as being decisive and ﬁnal
on questions of Constitutionality. VVe
have set up the mechanism and must
continue to bear with it until a
change is made.”

According to Judge Smith, the at-
tributes of every prospective la.wyer
should possess are: A critical, intelli-
gent analysis of present conditions;
the courage to go ahead and tear
down present opinions if necessary;
and the courage to keep alive his
ideals in the face of opposition.

The meeting, presided over by
Frank Reich, C36, president of the
John’ Marshall Club, included several
musical selections by Eugene Burk-
hart. C36, and a talk by Dr. Roger
V. Shumate, assistant professor of po-
litical science, and an adviser to the
club.

Mr. James B. Blackburn, assist-
ant professor of law, and a second ad-
viser of the organization, recited the
opinion of students concerning the
school of law, thus: “It is a place
where, in your ﬁrst year they scare
you to death; in the second year, they
work you to death; and in the third
year. they bore you to death.” He
concluded that the students should
take advantage of their undergradu-
ate days by developing a broad cul-
ture and they would get enough of
law in three years oflaw school.

As the climax of the evening, the
John Marshall Club tapped Raymond
Pefroni, ‘C37; Charles Herald, C36;
~ and James Lawrence White, C36.

Pitt News Will Pay For Style Party;

‘Everything Free,’ Asserts Tumpson

The Pitt News Style Show may soon
be considered a competitor of the
Student Chest and NYA for the hon-
or of being the most philanthropic in-
stitution on the campus.

At any rate, everything about the
show will be free, says Ellis Tump-
son, business manager of The News,
who occasionally doubles in brass as
dance promoter and convention-con-
ductor.

Next Wednesday afternoon, from
2:30 to 6:30, this paper will show the
fullness of its heart by throwing open
the doors of the Schenley Hotel ball-
room to all and sundry who care to
see the latest styles and dance after-
wards to Jimmy Bray’s music.

And _as if that weren’t enough, we
will have neckties and hosiery given
away as door prizes. Because of un-
founded rumors, however, it has been
necessary to announce that no meni-
ber of the publications staff will win,
even if he (or she) has the lucky
number.

Showing the latest fall and winter
fashions will be the Fintex Co., 235

Fifth Avenue, who will exhibit men's
suits and overcoats; Meyer Jonas-
son, Liberty and Oliver, women's
dresses; Max Azen, 705 Penn Ave-
nue, furs; and the VVise Shoe Store,
235 Fifth Avenue, women’s shoes.

Miss Grace Ely, of the University
Retail Training Bureau, will comment
011 the women's fashions, and Melvin
Morgan, of the Fintex Co., will do the
same for the men.

The complete list of gentlemen
models who will strut around in the
snappy fall and winter styles is as
follows: Charles Allcroft, John
Baker, Be_n Baskin, Gene Burkhart,

Charles H. Ebert, Jr., P. Bernard
Fleming, Harvey Goldstein, Tom
Howard, Robert Madden, Louis

Mammone, and Charles Perrine.

The women manequins include Dor-
othy Abraham, Alice Barchﬁeld, Mad-
eline Batty, Betty Black, Phyllis
Blumenfeld, Frances Calhoun, Bev-
erly Childress, Ruth Donley, Doris
Evans, Myrtle Gorden, Audrey Gra-
ham, Jo Kunkle, Margaret Lewis,
Irene Maroney, Louise McKirdy, Rose
Nugent, Vivian Roberts, Emily Sued-
don, Margaret Spear.

ChE Men Form New
Orientation Group

Chemical engineers, at their sem-
inar last Thursday, organizeda fresh-
man orientation group intended to
acquaint the new students with this
department of the School of Engineer-
ing. Three upperclassmen, James
Nicholas, ’36, Joseph VVasel, '36, and
Florian Majchrzak, ’37, will be ad-
visers.

This plan was suggested by Thom-
as Napier, ’36, president of the stu-
dent branch of the American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engineers. Elected
were John Lynch, ’39, president, Al-
fred Achenhiel, ’39, vice president, and

’Clifford Clark, ’39, secretary.

Miss Henry, Dr. Freehof

Lead Language Session

Miss Blossom L. Henry, assistant
professor of modern languages, pre-
sided over the meeting of the Pitts-
burgh Modern Language Association
Saturday morning where Dr.
Freehof of Rodef
gave the address.

Dr. Freehof spoke on “The Language
of Liberty,” stressing the historical
signiﬁcance of the use of words, such
as “equality,” “liberty,” and “frater
nity,” at various epochs. Today, he
said, these words are little under-
stood in their 18th century signiﬁ-
ca.nce. The development of narrow
and violent nationalisms, he added,
has replaced the larger concepts of
human relationships which existed at
the time of the American and French
Revolutions. _

Echoes Of Jungle May Sound
From Panther-Lion Struggle

Old Rivalry Renews In Battle At Stadium Tomorrow; _

Sutherland To Start Patched-Up Team Again

 

Just what happens when the King of the Jungle goes strolling
through the forests in search of prey is a problem for Frank Buck or

Martin Johnson to solve.

But when a Panther meets up with that

prowler, a pretty stiff battle is likely to be the outcome.
That’s the situation for tomorrow afternoon at the Stadium
when the Nittany Lions from Penn State take on the Pitt Panthers.
In tomorrow ’s picture the Lions will probably meet their master

in the form of the Panthers, but State%

followers are not a bit bashful in hop-
ing for the best.

Bob Higgins, Penn State coach, will
bring one of the best Blue and VVhite
elevens in recent years with him.
When he called the roll at training
camp this season, he found 14 letter-
men waiting to don uniforms, plus a
large number of promising yearling
gridders. In that group of 14, he had
six varsity linemen.

From the wealth of material avail-
able.‘Higgins ha.s rounded out a team
which has won all three of the games
played so far this season. In each
game, the Lions have shown decided
improvement over the form displayed
in the previous contest and tomorrow
Higgins’ outﬁt hopes to hit its peak.

The Panthers met Penn State in
1931, inﬁicting a 41-6 defeat on the
wearers of the Blue and White. The
last time that a Penn State elven
was able to dish out a defeat to the
Panthers was back in 1919. Higgins.
the present head man, played end on
that team.

Vvhile Higgins may make changes
in his starting lineup, it is probable
that he will start a team made up of
at least seven lettermen. At ends,
Bill Miller and Frank Smith will
likely get the nod. Smith has been
hampered by injuries but will be in
shape for tomorrow's game. Miller
is the only newcomer to the forward
wall this season, but he held a re-
serve post last year.

At ta.ckles two hefty boys will at-
tempt to turn back Panther backs.
Captain Bob VVeber and Roy Schuy-
ler. both experienced linemen. are the
nominees. and at the guard posts,
Higgins will use Luther Barth and
either Johnny Economos or Francis
VI/ismer. Chuck Cherundola will com-
plete the Lion’s. forwardwall, taking
care of the center position.

In the backﬁeld the Penn State
coach will probably start the same
quartet that he used against Lehigh
last Saturday. Frank O’Hara, junior
letterman, will call signals; Sam
Donato and Fritz Owens will ﬁll the
halfback positions; and Walt Kominic
will be at fullback.

On this eleven the line will average
approximately 195 pounds, while the
backs average a few pounds lighter.
"Coach Jock Sutherland has made
several changes in the varsity lineup
during practice sessions this past
week. using Henry Adams at left end,
Don Hensley at center and Leo Ma-
larkey at one of the halfback posi-
tions. Frank Souchak, varsity end,
was hurt again in practice and his
place has been taken by Adams.

A tentative starting eleven for the
Panthers would include Adams and
Shaw at ends; Matisi and Detzel at
tackles; Glassford and Dalle Tezze at
guards; and either Kliskey or Hens-
ley at center. In the backﬁeld Michel-
osen or Greene at quarterback, Malar-
key or Randour at left half, and La-
Rue or Shedlosky at right half, and
Patrick at fullback will form the
backﬁeld.

The game will start at 2 o’clock,
and according to Frank Carver, pub-
licity manager for Pitt, if as many
people buy tickets as the number who
have asked for comps, there will be
a large crowd.

Freshman Eleven
Plays Kiski Today

Yearlings Seek To Avenge Loss
Suffered By Predecessors

After wrangling and deliberating
for a week, officials have ﬁnally de-
cided that the Pitt freshmen-Kiski
game will be played tomorrow.

Both teams have tasted defeat in
their last appearance, and are eager
to get in the win column. Kiski was
trounced by the Navy plebes, 27-0,
last week, while the Little Panthers
opened the season on the wrong foot,
being beaten by a ﬁghting Tech frosh
team, 3-0. Against the Carnegie Tech
plebes Kiski was held to a scoreless
tie.

Coach Mill’gan will use his strong-
est possible lineup tomorrow, proba-
bly the same team that faced the Car-
negie Tech plebes two weeks ago.

The Little Panthers will leave by
bus at 10 o’clock Saturday morning,
and return from Saltsburg Saturday
night.

however, may compete tomorrow, if
his head cold has cleared up suffi-

ciently.

Penn State boasts a string of eight
straight dual triumphs over the past
two seasons. For the present‘ season,
Lehigh took it on the chin by a per-
fect score, 15-40, and only this past
week-end Yale dropped a 22-33 deci-
sion to the State runners.

In Olexy, national scholastic cross-
country champion in 1933, State has a
good replacement for the shoes left
vacant by Harvey, only varsity letter-
man to graduate from the team that
handed Pitt its single defeat in 1934.

Book, who placed second in that
meet, along with Downey, will be
plenty tough to beat. In all, a total
of nine men remain from last year’s
squad.

The Panther yearlings tackle the
Penn State freshmen in the prelimin-
ary race at 10 o’clock. The varsity
teams of these schools run at 10:30
o’clock, following the frosh competi-
tion. The Pitt ﬁrst-year runners show
an undefeated record in three starts,
to date.

Frosh Win

Schenley High School ended up on
the short end of a 23-32 score as Bon-
orati led. the Pitt freshmen to their
third consecutive win in cross-country
in a dual meet Tuesday afternoon.

Tredennick trailed Bonorati to
score second for the freshmen. Cogs-
well registered a third, followed by
four Schenley High boys, Haynes.
Rufiin, Titus, and- King.
Weyne clinched the meet for Pitt by
crossing the line in eigthth and ninth
places. Muir, in tenth, completed the
score for the high school aggregation.

The Pitt freshmen previously
gained decisions over the Canonsburg
and Oliver High School teams by ex-
actly the same count, 19-36.

Olson plans to enter his entire var-
sity squad in tomorrow’s cla.sh with
Penn State. Finishers seventh to 13th
will make up the squad for the Jay-‘
vee trip to Bethany on November 2.
On this same day, the varsity tangles
with Butler over the Schenley Park
ﬁve-mile layout.

Phi Delts Cop Opener
In Interfrat Football

Showing ﬂashes of potential power,
Phi Delta Theta captured the opening
game in the Interfraternity Touch
Football Tourney by nosing.’ out Phi

Gamma Delta, four ﬁrst downs to two.
Although the contest ended up in a 6-6
deadlock as far as touchdowns were

* concerned, the Phi Delts were awarded

the decision by virtue of their advant-
age in first downs.

When Neff Wells intercepted a pass
on the three-yard line and fel1,,over the
goal line in the ﬁrst period, Phi Delta
Theta jumped to an early lead. Re-
taliating in the following quarter, the
Phi Gams evened the score as Bert
Williams pounced on a fumble in the
end zone.

Basketball Tags
For Frolic Days

Still with the title of Freshman
Basketball Week, but enlarged upon
to include all upperclass novice bas-
ketball players, Dr. Carlson's annual
novice cage tournament moves along
with another avalanche of application
blanks pouring in on the good doc-
tor’s clinic office.

The tournament, starting Monday
and continuing through Tuesday,
Thursday, and Friday of next week,
already promises to be another suc-
cess and another feather in Dr. Carl-
son’s hat. Starting as strictly a ﬁrst-
year man affair, the basketball week,
as a result of a number of upperclass
protests, will now include all novice
basketball players.

All that is necessary for the novice
interested is to ﬁll out the applica-
tion blank, hand it in at the Stadium
or.the Falk Clinic. beg, borrow, or
steal something that resembles a has-
ketball suit, a.nd report at the Stadium
floor next week for his share of the
sunshine that Dr. Carlson's tourna-
ment spreads.

In ﬁlling out the application blank,
make it a point to check the (lays and
the hours that are suitable for the
novice. The various games will begin
at 2 o’clock each day a.nd the teams
will play in intervals of one hour.
One of the slight changes in this
year’s tournament is that there will
be no teams entered. the teams being
chosen during the tournament.

Another fact that Dr. Carlson
wishes to make clear is that the af-
fair is without any form of taxation
whatsoever for the entrant. The
tournament is held entirely for the
better acquaintance of students, and
for the fun of the affair.

All games are to be played upon
the Stadium floor from 2 to 6 o’clock.

Muscles?

That Machine At The Clinic
Will Tell You How Well
They Resist Fatigue

A machine, whose primary function
is the measurement of fatigue a.nd its
association with relaxation, has been
invented by ‘William R. Ludewig, in-
structor in mechanical engineering,
and has been installed in the Student
Health Service located in the Falk
Clinic.

A person who wishes to test his
muscles by this machine grasps a
lever, regulated to bring any set of
muscles into play, and pulls on the
lever until fatigue overpowers these
muscles.

The strength of each pull is meas-
ured by the length of a line on a
graph. As the muscles grow more
tired with each pull, the lines tend to
become smaller until they fail to reg-
ister.

After rests of approximately 15 sec-
onds, the same process is repeated
again and again until the record
shows the amount of rest necessary
to revive the muscles. This indicates
the importance of relaxation in re-
building wornout tissues, according to
Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, director of the
Student Health Service for men.

Sutherland Writes Again

Dr. John B. Sutherland, head foot-
ball coach, again in collaboration with
William S. Maulsby, is the author of
‘Get There First,” an article appearing
in the next issue of “Sport Story” ma-
gazine.

Eleven Tennis Enthusiasts Remain
In Third Round Of Net Tournament

 

Eleven Pitt tennis stars reached the
third round in the second annual Uni-
versity tennis tournament before the
rain again halted activities on W'ed-
nesday. According to Eugene Cohen,
in charge of the tourney, few others
may reach this round unless they
complete their matches immediately,
as he is preparing to wield his default
pencil drastically very soon.

Bob Madden’s game was too well
polished for Eugene Grennan’s south-
paw steadiness, as Madden dropped
only two games in winning, 6-1, 6-1,
last week. Ralph Bald, ranked sec-
ond to Madden, had no chance to dem-
onstrate his ability when he won by
default from Regis Ferson.

In a much closer match than the
score would indicate, Roy Heckler,
last year’s varsity player, defeated
numeral winner, Dick Conti, 6-1, 6-1.

With a superior driving game, husky

Rowland VVilson defeated Dick Kin-
ney, 6-1, 6-4. while Tom Locke defeat-
ed Paul C. Kennedy, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, in a
bitterly-contested match.

James X. Thompson displayed mid-
season form in defeating Harry Or-
ringer, 6-0, 6-1. Bill McKenna defeat-
ed Bob Gibney by the whitewash
route, 6-0, 6-0. Ben Wood of the
School of Medicine defeated Edwin
Ellis, 6-3, 6-4. Two freshmen, Harold
Neff and Adrian Hartman, battled for
nearly two hours in the longest match
of the tournament with Hartman ﬁ-
nally winning by the score of 6-2, 2-6,
8-6. Irvin Solow and Al Duff ad-
vanced by forfeits over Robert Culp
and Jack Rice.

Cohen is determined to have the
ﬁnals played off by next Friday, and
says that he will forfeit all quarter-
ﬁnal matches not completed over the
week-end unless the weather makes
play impossible.

Lockhart To Plan
New Music Unit

Will Organize Women’s Orchestra
To Supplement Regular Group

At a meeting Vfednesday of all Uni-
versity women who have had train-
ing in music, Lee M. Lockhart, direc-
tor of the University band and orches-
tra, announced plans for the forma-
tion of a women’s musical instrument
unit on the campus.

The group is to meet frequently and
practice‘ as a‘ separate orchestra in
addition to practicing with the reg-
ular University orchestra. Occasion-
ally the group will play at women’s
functions.

Up until now the University orches-
tra was composed mainly of men. It
is Mr. Lockhart’s hope that the
women on the campus who play in-
struments will show more interest
and that more women will participate
in musical activities.

“This is the ﬁrst conscious effort
to get women into this activity,” he
said.

Any women who are interested but
who were unable to attend the ﬁrst
meeting should get in touch with l\/Ir.
Lockhart.
