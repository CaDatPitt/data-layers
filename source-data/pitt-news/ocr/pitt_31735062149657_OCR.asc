Choruses Plan  Acheson t9 Talk library Gets

Beard-Growing‘
Match in Feud

“We have stood it long enough!
We’ve revolted!”

Thus did Ralph Hallock, C42,
speaking for the girls’ chorus of
Cap and Gown, announce their in-
tentions of proving to the boys’
chorus, in particular, and to the
student body, in general, that the
“girls” are as much men as the
boys and can grow real beards.

“It is our plan,” Kallock said, as
he outlined the intricacies of the
beard growing contest, “to outdo
them this time for the last time.”

Original plans of the “girls” was
to begin their beards immediately
and not shave until the show, but
arbitrators led by Ted Biddle,
graduate manager, convinced them
to compete with the boys. As a re-
sult, the competing teams will be
shaved on the Monday following
the Easter vacation and will not see
razors again until the evening be-
fore the ﬁrst show.

The teams include, as the “girls,”
besides Kallock, Sam Camarata,
C40; Bud Schlesinger, C41; Bill
Angel, BA39; Oscar Sheﬁed, C41;
and Dave Tucker, C41. The boys
are Ralph Myers, C41; Maurice
Citron, C42; John McRorie, BA39;
Jerry Hahn, C41; and Jack Mullin,
M41.

The arbitration committee, head-
ed by Biddle, will decide the win-
ner and award a prize. Other con-
testants may be added to the group.

CBR to Conduct
Poll on Content
Matter of News

Five thousand ballots will be dis-
tributed in fourth hour classes today
by the Collegiate Bureau of Research,
states Larry Rothman, C41, chair-
man.

Ballots will be colored._to facilitate
tabulation according to schools. On
them will appear lists of editorial
and news features used regularly by
The News. Students will be given a
chance to check their preferences for
the style and material of the publi-
cation.

Rothman points out that this poll,
first of a bi—weekly series on campus
issues, will furnish a deﬁnite cross
section of student opinion. Results
of the poll will be published after the
Easter vacation.

“Other polls,” says Rothman, “con-
tacted few people and did not con-
cern local issues. These surveys will
concern the University and will in-
dicate changes and improvements
which the students think necessary.

Students interested in statical and
tabulation work who would like to
join the staﬁ are asked to contact
Rothman. The Bureau is sponsored
by the University News Service, un-
der the direction of Robert X. Gra-
ham.

Bureau Cites Level

Status of Business

Business in the Pittsburgh district
remained almost unchanged last
week, remaining at 86.3 per cent of
the 1923-25 seasonally adjusted
average, according to the weekly re-
lease of the University Bureau of
Business Research.

The volume of production de-
creased slightly, owing chieﬂy to de-
creases in steel ingot production,
electric power output, and bitumin-
ous coal tonnage. On the other hand,
trade——reﬂected in department stores
——increased, as did new passenger
car registrations.

Sales in Pittsburgh department
stores were nearly 6 per cent greater
during the last month than in the
same period last year, due mostly to
the lessened period of pre-Easter
trade.

Professors Will Hold
Two Science Seminars

held today at 12:30 o’clock. Dr. W.
 Emig, associate professor of biolo-
gy, will speak on “Problems in Plant

biology, will discuss the “Seeding of
Conifers.”

A physiology seminar will be held
tomorrow evening at eight o’clock in
the home of Dr. E. A. Wolf, associate
professor of biology. E. A. Nazario
will discuss “The physiological sig-
niﬁcance of certain elements found in
the body in traces.” Students inter-
ested in physiology are invited to at-
tend.

‘A Greater Inspiration . . .

Yugoslavian Minister Stresses Cultural: 9
Significance of Latest Nationality Rooms-

By E. Seymour Kerber

The Yugoslav Nationality room
will not only present to the Ameri-
can student an example of Yugo-
slavia’s cultural contributions but
will serve to keep those of Yugoslav
origin from feeling ashamed of that
origin, Constantin Fotitch, minister
to the United States, declared last
Friday.

Mr. Fotitch was in Pittsburgh to
dedicate the sixth completed nation-
ality room as the ofﬁcial representa-
tive of His Majesty, Peter the Second.
COMMUNITIES CONTRIBUTE ’

The United States, according to
Fotitch, expects all the national

not only by their material work, but
also to contribute their intellectual
and moral share toward the general
American civilization.

The Cathedral of Learning has
been given by the University of
Pittsburgh as a shelter for the na-
tionality roorns. “In building this
room,” Fotitch told the assembled
Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes, “you
have manifested not only your love

communities to contribute to the lift.

A
3 for the country of your ancestors,.for

its culture, for its traditions, for its;
civilization, but you have shown al:-.
so in what way you and the younger
generation which will come after you
will best serve your new country and
contribute your part in its develop-
ment.” ‘ '

BETTER RELATIONS -

Greater fulﬁllment of the relation-
ship between Yugoslavia and the

of the Room committee, he
“Possibly the committee can now, are,
range for graduate exchange scholar-
ships between American and Yugo-
slav universities.” "

The minister also praised the com-
lmittee on their choice of representa-
'tive Yugoslav men of scholastic and
cultural achievement.
sires that the “Yugoslav Room will:
serve .
ﬁnding greater inspiration for work
and better achievement.”

Men such as Nicholas Telsa and
Michael Pupin will be easier to pro-
duce in this new type of environment,
Fotitch believes. -

United States can now be the object.

It would, of course, be grossly unfair to think of

outstanding one of the film. You remember him for
his characterization of “De Lawd” in the cinema ver-
sion of “The Green Pastures.”

 

Rooney indulges in a bit of philosophy on the slave
question when he says, “No human bein’ has a right to
own another human bein’. Human bein’s make a mess
of their own lives without messin’ in other human bein’s
lives.”

Captain Brandy, IVIickey’s friend, tells him, “I have a

suffer the same success that the GOP suffered during the
1936 presidential election. The fraternities haven’t made

any counter claims yet; but no doubt, their rebuttal will '

Publicity

Stan Markey who is interested in publicizing “At

looking around for a brand new idea. Something big,
different, and startling. That’s a big order, but a mem-

may ﬁll the bill. He would center in the Commons room
a large blinking, red, white, and blue neon sign. He
has something there . -

He was convinced that the release of 1000 rats in the

of “Brother Rat.”

silently. However, because the custom originated when
runaway horses were a constant threat, it has carried
down to the time of streamlined cars. Now it is no
longer necessary to talk on the outside, claims the

author, and permissible to take the inner lane. The

author knows it; now someone ought to tell the girls.

Bassclls Swing Concert

By Ralph Kallock

Having proved its versatility in
standard marching and conventional
concert music, the University band
set out to conquer a new ﬁeld, swing,
when 60 picked musicians played the
seventeeirth annual home concert at
Carnegie music hall, Friday night.
And conquer they did.

Little more than mediocre in the
ﬁrst few selections of the program,
the band entered the second portion
with an invigorating tone that put
new life into everyone in the audi-

V ence.

ABILITY OF SOLOISTS

The instrumentation and tone of
the band deserves high praise, the
only defect being a “muddy” horn
section. The Clarinets and other
wood winds performed particularly
well throughout the entire concert.
The ability of the soloists was re-
sponsible for several delightful ren-
ditions, Sidney Car1burg’s medley of
old favorites arranged for the ma-
rimba being especially noteworthy.

Under the baton of M. S. Rocereto,

'director emeritus, the band respond-

ed well to interpret Gounod’s “Fu-
neral March of a Marionette.”

“La Dame Blanche” by Boieldieu
was technically correct and provided
crashing contrasts, while Greig’s
“Triumphal March” was good once it
was under way. The ﬁrst half of
the program was otherwise unevent-
ful.

JUNGLE MUSIC

But in the second half, the band
really hit its stride. Not necessarily
because of the type of music played,
but because of the spirit of the mu-
sicians. Hardly recognizable in its
concert (and original) dress, “Deep
Purple” by De Rose, was one of the
highlights of the evening.

lam” proved to be only a herald to
what was to follow in the style of
swing. Called a “Rhapsoclic Evolu-
tion,” this piece not only generously
mixed jungle with Lennox, but also
gave clarinctist Ray Light and trom-
bonist Richard I-Iaughton a chance to
swing out.

The most popular selection of the
entire concert was “Symphony in E
ﬂat.” Featuring the trumpet of com-
poser-alumnus Robert Sarraf, and a
swing band directed by Harold
Broudy, this number more or less
conclusively indicates that swing is
here to stay, even for concert bands.

Credit goes not only to the capable.
leadership of Associate Director Rob-
ert Arthur, who led most of the con-
cert, Director Finney, and T. Ed-
ward Cartwright, student director,
but to every one of the 60 musicians.

From the
Slaouider

By Leonard Levison
Sports Editor

 

From all the sources that should know, I have been able to gather
the information that that sport of gentlemen, crew rowing, is about
to inroad itself into the University ’s ivy-beckoning athletic program.
\Vhich means that by the start of next semester Pitt will have its
ear in another branch ‘of athletic activity. (If you don’t’ like that,
you can swini home.)

There are only a few minor contingencies that stand in the way
of the realization of this proposal and they seem on the way of
being steamrollered out of the questionable status. Momentum for
the crew-racing-along-the-Allegheny-the-Ohio-or-the-Monongahela has
been rolling along in full acceleration and it seems certain to end in
the attainment of its objectives. \Vhile I don’t have any word from
the authorities at Tech and Duquesne, Jimmy Hagan has indicated a
most favorable disposition to the whole thing. So even if you get
your rowing machines out now, you'll only be a few months ahead
of any one else.

There’s Plenty of Water Here

Everyone, including the powerful lobbying group that met in
town last Friday, has been talking about the natural advantages that
our three-rivered community has over any of the other rowing cen-
ters. Dr. Francis J. Tyson, the economic Phi Bcte with a rich ath-
letic background, grew up on the banks of the Schuylkill. He has

only enthusiasm for the prospect of rowing on the local waters. He
claims that our physical provisions are just as good, if not better than
those of Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Yale, and Poughkeepsie, which
any superﬁcial oar-tugger knows to be the collegiate rowing high-
spots.

Rowing is a sport, too, that can be developed into major-league
stuff with a minimum expenditure of time. \Vashington, now one of
the crew powers that be, started off with nothing but a second-hand
crate and in ten years achieved its position of pre-eminence. In the
1928 Olympics at Amsterdam, the Germans didn’t even have a row-
ing entry. By the time of the Berlin games in ’3 , they were ac-
complished enough to win ﬁve out of the eight events. \Vith the
sturdy stock that is reputed to inhabit this campus, Pitt can look

ahead to Poughkeepsie winner in a very few years.

Roland Logan Leaves
Pitt For West Point  

Roland Logan, trainer of Pitt athletic teams for the last two
years, has resigned his position and accepted a similar post in the
United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.

Graduated from the University of Kansas in 1930 where he played
varsity football, Logan has been training, conditioning, and coaching

athletes for the last nine years.

He was appointed trainer and fresh-

man line coach.

In 1932 he accompanied the Amer-
ican Decathalon team to the Olymp-
ics as trainer. At the same time he
conditioned Glenn Cunningham. Dur-
ing the same year he accepted posi-
tions as trainer at George Washing-
ton University, where he also served
as freshman basketball and assistant
varsity football coach.

During the winter of 1934-1935 Lo-
gan was varsity basketball coach at
the George Washngton. In 1935 he
was signed as trainer of the Ameri-
-can league’s Boston Red Sox, and he
remained with the team for three
-seasons.

In his letter of resignation Logan
refers to athletic director as “a ﬁne
-‘administrator . . a grand person.”

The letter of resignation follows:

"I have been honored by the United
‘States Military Academy at ‘Vest Point.
New York. by being appointed Head
'1‘:-aincr of all athletic teams.

"Since this appointment will 1'13-ovide
‘many a(lv:1nt:|;.-.1-s and opportunities
hoth to m_\'selt' and to my family, I have
accepted this position.

“It has been a pleasure to work an-
'der Jinnny Hagan here at Pitt. He is
a ﬁne administrator. but what is more,
"he has been a grancl person with whom
to be associated. I have been and still
am in heart)’ accord with the new code,
and the ethics which the University is
‘trying to establish and will establish.

“It is with deep regret that I must
depart from my friends here, and from
‘a great I7ni$‘ersit)‘.”

Pi Tau Phi Inducts

Dr. Oliver L. Reiser, associate pro-
fessor of philosophy, will give the
main address at the Pi Tau Phi tap-
ping banquet this Wednesday eve-
’ning at 6 o’clock in the College club.

Nine February tappees and 20 who
were tapped in March will be in-

-ducted at the banquet.

Next Pitt Sport
May Be Rowing

There is a deﬁnite possibility that
rowing will be added to the intramu-
ral program this autumn, according
to Athletic Director James Hagan.

County Commissioner John Kane
has been interested in intercollegiate
rowing in this area for some time,
and has led a number of conferences
between oﬁicials of the three local
collegiate athletic departments.

Pittsburgh has two four-mile
courses on the Allegheny and Monon-
gahela rivers which compare favora-
bly with any river speedways in the
country. Along each course run rail-
way tracks, which insure spectators
accommodations «on slow moving
trains during any races.

If the county officials were to build
a boathouse that could be used by
college competitors, Hagan believes
that the chief obstacles toward inter-
collegiate rowing would be eliminat-
ed. The boathouse would also pro-
vide facilities for individuals inter-
ested in river sports.

The ﬁrst step in establishing row-
ing as part of Pitt’s varsity sport pro-
gram would parallel the procedure
used in bringing baseball back to
Pitt. First a number of second—hand
shells would be made available for
use among a number of independent
crews—as part of the intramural
program.

If sufficient interest is shown, and
Hagan points out that varsity rowing
has tremendous student interest
wherever it is part of the program,
then rowing will be included as a
varsity sport. The ﬁrst shells will
probably be made available this au-
tumn.

Cold Week Hinders

Diamond Workouts

“You can’t win” could easily be
baseball coach Ralph Mitterling’s la-
ment now for not only is the opening
game a mere eight days away but
rain and cold weather spoiled a good
part of the scanty practice time last
week.

While several workouts were held
outside, the rest were run oﬁ under
the Stadium and consisted mostly in
just tossing the ball around. For the
pitchers, it was not so much of a
handicap, but the batters suffered a
real blow from the layoff.

In the few days that remain, Mit-
terling must pick a squad of 25 or 30
men to take the Easter recess trip to
Georgetown, Duke, and South Caro-
lina. Two games will be played at
Durham.

Playoﬁ"- WeaI°y Ice Squad Ends Season
With 3-2 Overtime Loss to Blue Streak

By Bill McElwa.i.n

A bu1let—like backhand from
the stick of Eddie Arsenault
brought the 1938-39 Ohio—Pennsyl-
vania college season to a close Fri-
day night, and gave John Carroll
University of Cleveland the league
championship for the second time in
the two years of the loop’s existence.

The Blue Streaks’ win was in the
books, 3-2, after 2:22 of the ﬁrst
“sudden death” overtime, the same
score by which Carroll defeated Pitt
Wednesday in three overtimes, but
had it not been for goalie Bud Ellis
and center Dick Friday of the Pan-
thers, the match would have ended
in the regulation three periods.

Friday, playing with his sprained
ankle tightly taped, twice brought
Pitt from behind in the third session
to tie the score, 2-2, at the close of
the ﬁrst 45 minutes. Ellis added an-
other to his. string of remarkable
goal tending performances during the
playoffs.

It was a tired bunch of boys who
stomped into the Pitt dressing room
after the game. In 11 days, they had
clashed with Duquesne and John
Carroll six times, three of the bat-
tles going into extra periods. One,
the second Duquesne fracas, went
ﬁve overtimes and 115 minutes.

Beaten three times in four starts by
the Dukes during the regular season,
Pitt dropped the playoff opener 3-2
when the Bluiﬁtes scored all their
goals in the ﬁnal period, then, in the
record breaking “long game,” tied
them 1-1. The Dukes scored ﬁrst in
the third match, but Pitt came back
to win 3-1, and take the division
championship with a 2-1 victory in
the ﬁnale.

Wednesday, the Blue Streaks had
the game neatly tucked away 2-0,
but Bill Schildecker scored twice in
the last period, and the game 0011‘
tinued with Pitt doing the attacking.

was in bad condition, and Tatey Brit-
tain’s knee, injured Wednesday, was
still weak and ready to fold com-
pletely if bumped hard enough. But
Bi-ittain’s knee wasn’t bumped, Fri-
day’s ankle held up, and both played
brilliantly. '

Arsenault passed to Rancourt who
opened the scoring at 12:07 of the
second period. Still behind in the
third period, Pitt ﬁnally tallied when
Friday slammed in the rebound of
Shiring’s shot at 6:11.

Seconds later at 7:00, Arsenault
soloed in to hit the cords and break
the tie. With half a minute to go,
coach Mcsorley pulled Ellis and put
on six forwards, the move paying off
at 14:51 when Friday’s shot at the
corner of the cage glanced off a Car-
roll man‘s skates and over the line.

A seven minute extra frame result-
ed in no score, but after 2:225 of a
“sudden death” period, Arsenault
soloed the length of the ice, zoomed
in from the left and blazed in a
waist high shot to end the season.

Spring Smoker

Jack Moore, M39, has been
named the outstanding man in the
School of Mines. The announce-
ment was made at the Mines Asso-
ciation smoker held last Thursday
evening.

The selection was made on the
basis of scholaship, personality,
and activities. Moore is secretary-
treasurer of Sigma Gamma Epsi- 
lon, honorary mining fraternity. '
He has a quality point average of
2.44, and is a member of Sigma
Tau, honorary engineering frate-
nity.

Thirty men in the School of

To Face Tulane
Men Tomorrow

A two-man team from Tulane uni-
versity of New Orleans will argue
the question of public recovery
spending with two representatives of’
the Men’s Debating Association be-
fore an Indiana high school group in

Indiana, Pa., tomorrow at 2:30
o’clock.
William Tete, sophomore at the‘

Southern university, and Norbert N.
Salpeter, senior, will defend the neg-
ative of the question, stated, “Re-
solved: that the United States should
cease to use public funds for the pur-
pose of stimulating business.” Rug-
gero Aldisert, C41, and Earnest Lar-
sen, C40, will uphold the affirmative.

Tete and Salpeter met a Carnegie
Tech team yesterday, and will travel
from Indiana tomorrow to debate
the University of Louisville, Thurs-
day.

Tete was the winner of both the
Carnot Medal for Debate and Fresh-
man Medal for Debate in 1938.

Salpeter won the George Prize for
Debating in 1938 and 1939. In the
former year he achieved the G. H.
Terregury Prize for Public Speaking.
A former member of the William
and Mary varsity group, he was the
winner of the College Debating Cup
in 1937.

‘Big Bargain’
Festival Ticket
Sales Continue

At the present time most business
stores are having major sales, but ac-
cording to Edwin Ellis, C39, chair-
man of the Spring Festival, “the big-
gest bargain in town is right on the
University campus.”

Spring Festival booklets valued at
$7.50 are being sold for $5. Reserva-
tions for the books of tickets can be
made for $2. The “lay-away” plan
has been adopted by the committee
in order that students will have suf-
ﬁcient time to complete payment on
the books. ~ _

Most University students believe
that Carnival Night will be held in-
side Trees Gymnasium, -but Ellis de-
clared, “Booths for Carnival Night
will be set up in'Trees ﬁeld, beside
the tennis courts and not in the gym.”

Pep Tablets Cut

Learning Rate

MINNEAPOLIS, MINN.—(ACP)—
Pep pills retard the speed of learn-
mg.

That is the conclusion reached
by William L. Minkowsky, graduate
student in psychology at the Univer-
sity of Minnesota who, with several
white rats as assistants, has just con-
cluded several months of experimen-

Each morning for 25 days Mr. Min-
kowsky injected 1 cc. or benzedrine
sulphate, or pep pill solution, into the
rats of one group while those of an-
other group continued their regular
diet. The rats were then placed in
a maze and Mr. Minkowsky recorded
the number of errors the animals of
each group committed before they
were able to ﬁnd the food at the end
of the maze.

Results show that the rats that had
not been given injections reduced
their number of errors from 14.5 the
ﬁrst day to 1.35 on the ﬁnal day.
