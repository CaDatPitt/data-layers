Community
out of
touch with
Brennan

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Director of Public Safety Wil-
liam Brennan continues to work
at "improving community rela-
tions," but challenges and
problems remain.

Brennan has tried to reach out
to community groups, claiming
to have met with 60 in his first
two months on the job. However,
there are groups that still need to,
be contacted.

’’I haven't met with Brennan,
and no one else from this organi-
zation has," said Ellen Kerr,
volunteer coordinator for Pitts-
burgh Action Against Rape. "I
didn't even know there was a
new director of Public Safety.”

PAAR, the office ofwhich is lo-
cated on Forbes Avenue ltl Oak-
land, offers support for ‘rape
victims, helping them when they
talk to police and go to court.
Counseling is also available.

’’I wouldn't mind talkingto the ‘

Pitt police about how they can in-
volve us," Kerr said. ”The Pitt
police don't want to go to the
emergency room with the victim.
We will do that.

”No one wants to say that there
are rapes on campus, because it's
bad public relations, but [rape]
does happen,” she said.

Kerr said that though PAAR had
been invited by some of Pitt's
fraternities and sororities to talk
about date rape, she has never
been approached by the Campus
Police.

”lf [Brennan] wants to set
something up, there are plenty of
people here who would love to
work at Pitt,” Kerr said. "We

would _like to train [dormitory].

resident assistants to handle rape
victims properly. We'd also like
to talk to freshmen every year
about theprevention of rape.”

Brennan said that he was not
aware of PAAR, but was willing
to work with them. He also said
that he was planning the making
of a video about safety for incom-
ing freshmen.

Kerr is not the only person in
the community who did not
know about the new director of
Public Safety.

”l was not aware there was a
change," said Barbara Nicholas,
director of Pitt's Women's
Center. "But I am aware of the
willingness to sweep things under
the carpet.

’Beating’ bothers meter maid

By Lynne Glover-Martin
For The Pitt News

She calls it a game of cat—and-
mouse. She is City Parking Patrol
Officer Lorraine Turner, and the
game she is talking about is
avoiding parking meter viola-
tions. And this game is becoming
increasingly popular in Oakland.

Turner is one of six city park-
ing patrol officers who stalks the
streets of Oakland issuing parking
tickets and hunting for people
who intentionally jam meters —
people like Roseanne.

Roseanne, a recent Pitt gradu-
ate, requested that her real name
not be used because she knows
how to play the parking meter
game, perhaps too well. She has
quite an extensive list of ways to
"beat the meters,” as she aptly
put it.

’’It is like a game. And I know

just about every trick there is and
I've used them all," she ‘claimed.

Among Roseanne's plays to
beat the meters is to remove a
parking ticket from somebody
else’s windshield and then place
it on her own.

''I only do this when I feel ex-
ceptionally mean,” she said.

Roseanne said she has jammed
meters with paperclips —— the big

ones — broken in half. "Flattened '

bottlecaps and nickels work
[well] too," she said.

If Roseanne or anyone else is
caught jamming a meter, he or
she could face a $300 fine, ac-
cording to Turner.

But Roseanne certainly isn't the
only one who knows how to jam
meters.

Between 200 and 300 meters
are purposely jammed every day
in Oakland, according to repair-
man Matt Dukovich. A crew of

six repairmen work full-time to _

repair the city's jammed and
broken meters. .

Dukovich said that Oakland
meters are, by far, the most van-
dalized in the city. "Every «month
we repair over 500 meters in the
parking" lot between [Hillman]
Library and the Carnegie Library
alone. '

”They stick broken popsicle
sticks in them,'beer tabs, bottle
caps, paper, gum, glue, bark from
trees, bingo chips, even pigeon
feathers! Guitar picks are popu-
lar in Oakland. I see meters with
the handles hammered off. Some-
times they paint thedome com-
pletely black. Once ina while on
Schenley Drive, we'll find a
meter ripped out of the ground
and thrown over the hill,”
Dukovich said.

Karen Walkney can sing, (lance

an instant that her microphone
was not working. The one thing
she (annot do is hear.

As an advisor fo.r Sign Connec-
tion, a Pitt organization (le(li(‘at—
e(l to promoting advancement for
(leaf people, she helped kick off
the sixth annual Deaf Awarness

Union.

Speaking with the ai(l of an in-

founded the event six years ago
by handing out leaflets and mail-
ing letters to local deal-(are
groups in order to create a bridge
between the hearing public an(l

”Many songs have good stories
and are very entertaining to deaf
people. They also enjoy seeing
things acted out," she added.

Walkney has been (leaf since
birth and eventually learned to
speak through the help of a
speech pathologist.

"But no one could understand
what I was saying until I was
about 25 years old," she said.

Walkney is the only deaf
professor at Pitt and was the first
deaf student ever to receive a
bachelor's degree here.

When asked what is was like
for a deaf person to attend a hear-
ing school, she said, '’It was
tough. No one could relate to me.
I had to have an interpreter attend
lectures with me. But just be-
cause I'm deaf didn't mean I

Continued from page 1

”There isn’t much visibility;
there isn't an accurate represen-
tation of crime at the university.
That's my personal opinion,” she
added.

Nicholas said that she has seen
an increase in ”hate crimes” in
the Oakland area. Hate crimes
are those in which a victim is at-
tacked not as a physical retribu-
tion or for fiscal gain, but because
of the victim’s sex, race, or reli-
gious beliefs.

’’I would like to see the Cam-
pus Police better trained to
differentiate between crimes for
profit and hate crimes,” Nicholas
said. ’‘I’d also like to see them

better trained to deal with vic-
tims. Often in rapes, the woman's
sexuality is treated as the issue.”

Brennan said that he met with
the provost’s Advisory Commit-
tee on Women's Concerns to ad-
dress these concerns, but was
willing to work with other
groups.

Steve Zupcic, president of the
Pittsburgh Ethnic Coalition, also
said he felt that hate crimes were
a major problem in the Oakland
area.

According "to Zupcic, a friend
of his was attacked by ”skin-
heads” earlier this year while
leaving a university building. He
said the skinheads surrounded his

friend, whom he refused to iden-
tify, and chanted,/’Kill a nigger,
kill a faggot, kill a Jew,” before
attacking him.

”The police basically asked
him what he did to provoke the
attack,” Zupcic said. ”There was
no robbery. Obviously, this was
a hate crime.”

Zupcic said he wasn't sure if
the Campus Police dealt with
hate crimes differently than ”fis—
cal crimes, but it's my perception
that they don't. They haven't in
the past

’’If the Campus Police want to
improve their department, they
should report these crimes as hate
crimes and not just muggings.

back against meter-jamming by
enforcing violations that most
motorists probably do not realize
even exist.

Turner said that police are now
issuing citations for exceeding the
meter’s allotted time limit. This
means that if you are parked at a
two-hour meter and return after
two hours to "feed the meter,”
you are actually violating a park-
ing statute and could be ticketed.

On an average day, Turner said

that between 300 and 450 tick-

ets are issued in Oakland.
Roseanne said she had ac-
cumulated over 60 parking tick-
ets during her two years as a Pitt
student. She has fought many of
these tickets in city traffic court.
”If you're going to fight your
ticket, be prepared to spend at
least two hours there. And you
should go down at night, with at
least five tickets to make it worth
your while. Mostof the time you
can get out of at least three of
them," she said.
Roseanne tells the magistrate,

  

”I swear to God I put money in
it. The timer must be fast.” Or,
she says, ’’It was jammed, I swear
to God it was jammed!”

On two occasions, Roseanne
sold her car to a family member
so she could get new license
plates for it.

”By getting new plates, my
car's record is wiped clean, more-
or-less, because of a hole in the
system,” she said, laughing.

”lt’s only $24 for new plates,
‘and lowed over $100 in parking

Boot,” she added.

The boot refers to the Denver
Boot, a device officials attach to
one wheel of a vehicle that im-
mobilizes it until unpaid tickets
are paid in full. Turner said that
violators are put on the ”boot
list” if they have four or more un-
paid parking tickets on file. Two
officers patrol the city with
minicomputers to catch scofflaws
(people with unpaid parking vio-
lations.)

”Not a day goes by that I'm not

body. And I only fix the meters!”
Dukovich said.

Turner said, ”In an article in
The Pitt News, they called us
‘Meter Maids from Hell.’ We are
just enforcing the law. They
shouldn't take it out on us.”

Turner also added that ”meter

occupational title.

Keeping America's
sights on the stars

The space shuttle Discovery has had another success-
ful mission, the third successful mission since the
Challenger disaster.

So why doesn't anyone seem excited? V

This mission’s completion opens the door for the rest
of_the year. NASA’s schedule is demanding, including
seven flights this year, which will launch probes to
Jupiter and Venus, as well as a powerful space tel-
escope. ‘ "

The space program is back on track, exploring our
solar system, helping us learn more about the universe
in which we live. And still, no one seems excited.

What happened to the enthusiasm that accompanied
J.F.K.’s promises to send a man to the moon? There was
a sense of discovery afoot then, a willingness to reach
for the starsand the unknown. I

While there are certainly enough earth—bound'

problems to keep us all very busy for the next thousand
years, our preoccupation with them does not mean that
we have to give up our dreams — sacrificing the desire
to explore and expand is as deadly as letting it take
precedence over pressing daily problems.

We are a generation which was brought up with space
on our minds. We have added to the old standard an-
swers to the question ”What are you going to be when
you grow up?” In addition to policemen, firemen, doc-
tors and nurses, we wanted to be astronauts.

Now the attention has shifted‘; the spotlights are point-
ed away. But happily, the drive goes on. NASA’s pro-

. grams are moving ahead, and there are still some of us

with our eyes on the stars.

Liberty for everyone

Well, it looks like another subculture of the United
States of America is interested in claiming the whole
country for itself. In Arizona, conservative Republicans
have designed a resolution, which was approved at the
state party convention, to delare that the United States
is a ”Christian nation.” To strengthen their arguments,
one party member solicited a letter from Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, citing three court opin-
ions supposedly ”to the effect that this is a Christian
nation.” Later, it was pointed out that two of the opin-
ions do not actually put forth the concept that we are
a country of Christians, but that is really beside the point.

America is America. It is not for any subgroup to claim,
as its own. Not Christians, or Moslems. Not blacks and
not whites. David Duke, notorious Louisiana legislator,
has made statements, along with every other two-bit ra-
cist in the country, to the effect that the majority rules
and America is for the majority. »

Wrong, guys. It is for all of us, majority and minority
alike. It was formed to protect the minorities. There is
no Christian United States — there is just America. Born
of the premise that we are all equal, regardless of race

or religion. Only as individuals, can we claim America
as our own.

Allow me to share a couple of

little stories with you. Vignettes
that have little. consequence un-
less you'd like them to...
‘ Last week, I was walking back
to my apartment in South Oak-
land, when I had to stop at an in-
tersection to wait for the traffic to
clear.

JESICA
COVILLE

Across the street from me were
two. Italian ladies with a small
child also waiting for the traffic to
pass. The little boy who was with
them was jumping up and down
as if he had just eaten a box- of
sugan

. ' Suddenly, as _if prompted by
 some professional wrestler, the

woman lifted thechild by one
arm and whacked the ‘hell out of

-. him.

. ”Don’t run into traffic; you
might get hurt!" she screamed. At
that point, I think the child would

‘ have preferred to get run over by

an oncoming semi rather than be

- hit by this crazed sumo woman.

The little boy proceeded to
scream and then went to the
woman who had hit himand
hugged her, as if searching for ap-
proval.

I share my home with a cat-

i_ a gray tabby named Kitty (pre-

Dukakis). She was entrusted to
me by my girlfriend in the hopes
that she could be provided with
a home better than the one she
was raised in.

When I first saw Kitty, she was
thin and scruffy-looking, with
patches of fur missing from her
neck and tail. Her owners told
me she had a vitamin-B deficien-
cy. My girlfriend told me Kitty
had been abused. -

So I brought her to Pittsburgh,
feeling proud that I was ‘doing

  

The traffic finally cleared, and
we both crossed. I looked at the
little boy and his tear—stained
face. The woman’ just sort of
growled at me. We then went on
with our separate lives.

Then last weekend, I was for-
tunate enough to visit the North
Hills mall, where I was subject-
ed to a slice of Americana (a la
John Cougar Mellencamp-style).

Again, I saw mothers with their
children waiting for something —
this time for the cashier to ring up
their purchases. -

A little girl, standing with a
woman who looked like her sis-

.Iter, was obviously getting impa-

tient and began to whimper.

Flashback to the firstwoman:
this woman lifted the child up
and smacked her. ”I told you to
shut up!” she yelled at the little
girl. , . .
”Well lady, if you'd stophitting
her maybe she wouldn't be:
screaming/.’ Ithought to myself,
disgusted at the way people han-
dle immediate situations. ‘

OK, I don't have any children,
but I do have a right to say that
it is pretty pathetic the way some
people discipline their kids. I
know I was no angel to bring up,
but my mother never smacked.
me like, these people‘ smacked
their children. I

So does this action made in
haste warrant thelabel of ’’child
abuse”? - _

In the‘American Indian culture,
the Indians let their children
crawl close tothe fire and get
burned. They believe that if chil-

- dren actually experienced the

pain, they would never get
burned again. Was that child
abuse or common sense?

So what about the little Italian

' and ”cat treats” in her food.

and got run overby that semi,

then his lesson would have been ,

guage classes.

Most of these students can
bear, but after taking Walkney’s
class, Kern said, many of them
switch their majors to something
which will enable them to help
deaf people.

Kern said that -a (leaf person
might choose Pitt over a deaf
school like Gallaudet University
in Washington, D.C. because Pitt
is a good school and is close to
where many of the deaf students
live.

Walkney said that it is impor-
tant for everyone to know at least
a little sign language. She said
that it is annoying to have to
speak through an interpreter and
not to be able to communicate
with doctors and nurses.

"If I can learn to speak, why
can't the hearing public learn to
sign?” Walkney said.

Brennan——

since he started as director in
lanuary, but he said he wants to
prevent the problem before it
happens.

’’All of my officers will go
through this program,” Brennan
said. ”This is such an important
problem that I have invited
officers from the Duquesne, ‘Car-
negie Mellon, Carlow and
Chatham police forces.”

While some programs that
could make Oakland safer have
not been started, there are also
complaints about current
programs.

Marte Fallshore, a graduate stu-

,dent in psychology, was disap-

pointed when she called the
escort service earlier this
semester.

”One night I called [the Cam-
pus Police] and asked to be
\\aIl<eCl from a university building
to a bus stop on the other end of
campus,” Fallshore said. ”I was
told they were busy and that it
was safe to walk. Their suggestion
was to walk through the dorms.

”It was about 9 p.m., so it was
early, but it was still dark out, and
I tried to walk in the most popu-
lated areas of the campus."

Fallshore said she was never
treated like that before, and was
surprised because she had always
been treated courteously in the
past.

"I don’t believe that hap-
pened,” Brennan said. ”My peo-
ple have been instructed to escort
the women who call us. No one
should get that kind of response.
It's not consistent with what we
want to do.”

Brennan said that he would
look into the matter personally,
and there would be disciplinary
action taken if necessary.

’’I wish the woman had come
to me immediately after it hap-
pened," he added. ”I can't solve
problems if they come to me 30
days later through a news
reporter.”

Brennan also‘. said he was de-

veloping programs for people to
report suspicious activities and
complaints.
_ ”We’re also printing up forms
for our officers to fill out if they
see anything dangerous, like
lights that are out or bushes that
are too high,” Brennan said.

The film is Equal justice, a two-

and directed by Thomas Carter,
who has directed the pilots that
launched such hits series as St.
Elsewhere, Miami Vice and A
Year in the Life. '

Carter's own company, in as-
sociation with Orion Television,
came to.Pittsburgh four weeks
ago to utilize its metropolitan
background to tell the story of
several district attorneys, living in
a big city, who must overcome
daily odds -to fight for Equal
/ustice. Today marks the end of
the film's rigorous 24-day shoot-

- ing schedule.

NEW YORK

The questions remain, though.
Why film in Pittsburgh?

1 posed this question to Gary
Randall, former Pittsburgher and
now president of Orion Tele-
vision.

”First of all, filming in New I

York or L.A. is outrageous. Loca-'
tion fees are astronomical. What
we wanted was to find an urban,
northeastern big-‘city look without
all the problems and hassles
found in those two_ places. Also,
since we're outof L.A. and the
Big Apple, we‘ can go non-union
onthe project and still make a
quality show,” said Randall.
Christopher. Knopf, :.who co-

’wrote-the teleplay along with

Carter and producer David A. Si.-
mons, feels that Pittsburgh sports
some of the most exC.iting.and
historicalarchitecture anywhere.

”Look at this,” he says, point-
ing to the courtyard of’ the‘ Al-
legheny County Courthouse.
”You can't get this in L.A. You
just ‘can't. This area is so full of
wonderful old architecture that
simply cannot be duplicated on

  STORIES

New York Stories, a collection
of ”cinematic short stories,” is a
bit of a disappointment. Enlisting,
America's three premier filmmak-
ers to capture the Big Apple
seems like a better idea than it
turns out to be. "

This is a real shame because
Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford
Coppola and Woody Allen (have
given us some classic fil'rns‘set'in

ies and Allen's Annie Hall are
among the great works of art to

last twenty years.

courts are almost impossible to
get into [to film]. The people here
have been extremely
cooperative." '

The film features an eclectic
cast and crew, drawing from act-
ing stables in New York, Los An-
geles, Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia.

The players include such
familiar faces as Cotter Smith,
who came to Pittsburgh some
years ago to do a film called Lady
Beware. Smith, who is married to

tice

screen actress Mel Harris (Came-

ron's Closet, K-9), feels that Pitts-J

burgh is a growing center for
commercial film production, and
he foresees bigger budget
projects ahead for the City of
Bridges.

Other members of the cast in-
clude: Sarah Jessica Parker
(-Square- Pegs, A Year in the Life,

Twist of Fate), Barry Miller (Satur-
day Night Fever, Peggy Sue Got
’ Married),

Deborah Farentino
(Hooperman, ..The Revenge of Al

Capone)’ and Kathleen Lloyd

(Magnum, P.I.).

in addition to bringing hired ta-O
lent from the world's largest com- '

mercial film center, Equal /ustice

has also brought many Pittsbur-

ghers in to work as well.
‘Hundreds of local extras were

hired on a daily basis, and some ;

have stayed on the movie to work
as stand-ins. ‘

Crew members (gaffers, grips,
best boys and production assis-
tants) also come from Pittsburgh,

steadily on films in the area for -

sons" follows their bickering-
filled breakup through the flashy
Soho art world.

"Life Lessons” is inspired by
the diary of Apollinaria Suslova,
a mistress and student of Feodor
Dostoevsky. Luckily, the charac-
ters were changed from writers to
artists because the gorgeous
painting is the most extraordinary
feature in "Life Lessons.”

Woody Allen has the final spot
with "Oedipus Wrecks.” In Han-
nah and Her Sisters, Allen's last
go at comedy, he was a

There are definitely some
laughs in the film; Woody Allen
is that rare comedian that can
make you fall for the same joke
ten or fifteen times.‘ But ”Oedipus
Wrecks” gets tiresome very
quickly. Too often, I felt like I was
watching scenes from the cutting

floor of Annie Hall.

L Qtists and

above Manhattan.

Woody Allen's whole neurosis
schtick reached its peak with An-
nie Hall over ten years ago. For
anyone familiar with Allen's
work, the humor in ”Oedipus
Wrecks” will seem very, very
familiar.

Of the three New York Stories,
only Scorsese's "Life Lessons” is
consistently good. Hopefully all
three directors will go right back
to work, and come up with three
full—length features to wash away
the bland taste of New York
Stories.

If you're a sucker for stories
with tormented, self-absorbed ar-
impossibly neurotic
I romances, then you'll enjoy ”Life

Lessons” as much as I did. A

clever, honest ending keeps the

story from becoming just another
cliched Pygmalion tale.
Coppola's "Life Without Zoe”
is wonderful to look at, but I can't l
believe he couldn't come up with
something better than this mud-
dled slice ofa little rich girl's life.
The best part of "Zoe" is Don
. Novello of Father Guido Sarduc—
ci fame, who plays butler to the
Park Avenue princess of the title.
The story, if you can call it that,
vaguely concerns Zoe's parents
reuniting and some kind of Mid-
dle Eastern intrigue. All I can real-
ly say is if you feel like leaving
during"Life Without ZQe" but
you're worried you might miss
something good, cast those wor-
ries aside.

Baseball  
  team ready
«for season

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

W For the sports fanatics out there,
those of you who can't get

enough live Pitt sports, the end of-

hasketball season still leaves

,,.some hope.

The Pitt baseball team is start-

ing its season. .
”We hope to field a competi-
tive team this season,” Coach
Bobby Lewis said. ”We are just
really getting started with the sea-
.»son, so we'll have to wait and
see.” '
The team recently returned
from their annual trip to Florida
with a 2-4 record. They played

tﬁftwo tough games in a row, beat-

ing Bethel College (7-4) and
Eastern Michigan (-4-3). In the
other four games, the Panthers
were outscored 59-15. _
”I was hoping that our offense

would be the strength ofthe,

team,” Lewis said. ”We are hop-
ing to outscore our opponents.
Right now,.l'd have to say that
our hitting has been mediocre at
best.”

No Cinderellas, no undeserv-
ing teams. Plain and simple, all
that remains in the NCAA tour-
nament are. fantastic games. For
the most part, anyway.

It's do-or-die time for the Michi-
gan Wolverines, who are stocked
with unbelievable ‘talent.

For years, the claim has been
that Bill Freider simply is not a
good bench coach, and as a

..gresult, Michigan has been a
failurein the NCAA tournaments

of the 1980s.

Freider is gone. Assistant Steve
Fisher is at the helm, and the
Wolverines have a clean slate
and a 2-0 record in tournament
play’ under him. .
- No one could blame the Wol-
verines if they lost to the North

Carolina Tarheels tonight in a

.:§Southeast Regional semifinal

game. After all, Freider accepted
the Arizona State coaching job

ow days before thscstartof the T  1- S T

 

tor’s explanatio_n would be sus-
pended for a minimum of 30
days. A subsequent. positive result
would bring a season—long sus-
pension.

The owners also passed a
”crowd control” rule that penal-
izes the home team for uncooper-
ative fans. If, after three warnings,
vociferous fans don't pipe down
so that visiting teams can call
their plays, the home team will
lose a timeout. And if some
smart-guy NFL head coach uses
up all his timeouts to get around
the rule, a 5-yard penalty will
then do just fine. -

Now, define ”uncooperative
fans.” How loud is too loud?
How will the referees judge?

Watch in 1989 for a sudden
surge in the number of NFL
signal-callers who clai_m to be

Fisher, who may or may not be
retained by Athletic Director Bo
Schembechler following the sea-

I. son's end, gives this team a -new

direction. The players will not be
playing under the stigma of a bad
coach or being underachievers.
They can play basketball, period.

One item that the owners swift-

Chuck Noll to void the current

of Fame linebacker and fashion
designer Jack Lambert.

him Pitt's all-time winningest

In an effort to protect its quar-

weight and overall, and followed
that up with a victorious effort at
the Golden Triangle competition
March 11 in the light heavy-
weight class.

”It makes me feel good about
myself,” Zirpoli said. ”It keeps
me in shape, and it keeps my
health up, and I'm just going to
keep going with it and see what
happens. Right now, I feel like I
want to keep doing it for the rest
of my life.” - .

Zirpoli’s success story started
innocently enough. About a year-
and-a-half ago, he began to be-

come seriously involved in
weightlifting with a friend. Obvi-
ously, the results were more than
he could ever have expected.

”When I started off, it was just
supposed to be as a lifter,” he
said. ’’I really had no desire to
compete as a bodybuilder, and as
I progressed with lifting, I decid-
ed to upgrade things and give it
a shot. My lifting partner really
helped me out — he told me to
hit a couple of shows, and that
got me started.”

will produce winning teams un-
til he quits coaching. But until he
quits robbing the juco's and starts
developing four—year talent, he
will not win a national champi-
onship.

Arizona 82, UNLV 70.

In the other West Regional, In-
diana will trounce a solid Seton
Hall squad on its way to the Fi-
nal Four.

The Pirates finished second in
the Big East behind powerful
Georgetown, but will be no con-
test for the Big Ten regular sea-
son champ.

Indiana 80, Seton Hall 68.

At 19-1 1, the Minnesota Gold-
en Gophers have the worst
record of any team remaining.
That record is not indicative of
their playing level.

The Gophers pulled numerous
upsets in the Big Ten this season.
Unfortunately, they will have to

watch the remainder of the tour-.

ney on television after playing
second-seeded Duke, with
player—of—the-year Danny Ferry.
Duke 74, Minnesota 59.

Rebuilding? John Thompson's
team doesn't know the meaning
of the word. The Hoyas, as deep
as their bench is long, are capa-
ble of winning the title, and, in
fact, will be in the championship
game on April 3.

North Carolina State, aspirited
winnerlover Iowa in double over-

time last Sunday, will not have.

anything left, despite their simi-
larly deep bench, after they stay

‘close to Georgetown in the first

 

half of this game.
Georgetown 74, N.C. State 64.

With the Final Eight set, the Fi-
nal Four takes recedence.

P Pitt's men's gymnastics team
closed out its dual meet season
last weekend at Penn State. The
Panthers were defeated by the
Nittany Lions 270.25 to 258.05,
even though they scored their
season high. The‘ Panthers
finished with an 11-5 record for
the year.

’’It was a good meet,” said

head coach Frank D’Amico.

”lorge [Gonzalez] really came
through and scored his season _
high, a 55.0, and took second

place in the the all-around.”

ln a meet in which Penn State
dominated all of the events, Pitt
did have a few bright spots.

Junior Gonzalez finished third
on the floor exercise with a score
of 9.25. Gonzalez was also third
on the pommel horse with a
score of 9.4.

Freshman Pat Murgolo took
third on the rings with a 9.35 and,
as D’Amico said, ”has an outside
chance at nationals.”

Taking second place on the
vault was Gonzalez, scoring a
9.2. Gonzalez was third on the
parallel bars with a 9.25.

’’I’m happy that our freshmen
did well,” said D’Amico when
asked about the overall season.
”They were a strong crux in the
team.

”We’re not losing anyone, so
our future should be better than
ever.”

Last fall, D’Amico pushed his
gymnasts in two weak events, the
parallel bars and the high bar.

’’It really paid off,” D’Amico
said. ”Now high bar is a bright
spot and something to look for-
ward to in the meet.

”Pommel horse was a real ne-
mesis this year. For next year,
we'll spend a lot of time on it,

  Gymnasts finish season with loss Body  

right from the start.”

This Saturday, the Panthers
host the East Coast Athletic Con-
ference and have invited 12
teams to compete. This meet in-
volves individual competition
only and includes both prelims
and finals.

’’In this meet, the gymnasts just
want to make finals,” said D’Ami-
co. ”Only the best in the East will
be there, and we'll see some
good gymnastics.”

’ The prelims will start at noon,
and the finals will begin at 7 p.m.
at Trees Hall.

interest him in becoming very
seriously involved in competi-
tion, he had to change his
lifestyle completely.

To put it mildly, nights on the
town and dinners at Burger King
and McDonalds are not common
for the bodybuilder—in—training.

”l work out aboutthree hours
a day,” Zirpoli said. ”l come
home from school and I go up to

the gym and lift fro_m about six tog

nine o'clock. It's a really high-
intensity thing ' and [really]
rigorous.

”l go at it hard for those three
hours, then lcome home, do my

;homework and go to bed. lddn’t

really have too much time on the

weekends to go out and stuff like .

that.”

And as if that bone-crunching
activity is not enough, Zirpoli
also follows a special diet.

”For the first four weeks, when 0

you start, it's not really strict,” he
said. “But then about five or six
weeks out, I take my calories to
about 2,400 calories a day. All it
consists of is chicken, rice and
potatoes. .
