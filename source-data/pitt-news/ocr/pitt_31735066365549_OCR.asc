Pitt students approved a
new student government Con-
stitution in a referendum ‘Mon-
day.

The new Constitution, which
will take effect in January with
the election of a seven—member
governing board, was approved by
a 7-1 margin.  _

The official tally was 391 in
favor of the Constitution, 54
against, and two abstentions. The
447 total votes represent about
four per cent of the approximately
11,000 students who were eligible
to vote in the referendum.

The 78 per cent affirmative vote
contrasts sharply with the 53 per
cent affirmative vote which pass-

. ed the presentgconstitution last

December.

The Constitution provides for a
seven—member Board, chaired by
a representative elected separate-
ly from the other Board mem-
bers, which has the “powers of
student government.”

The document also features an
internal system of checks and
balances on the allocations pro-
cedure, with the final decision
resting with the Board.

The responsibility of program-

NO ORGANIZED OPPOSITION

There was no major organized
opposition to the Constitution. un-
like the pre-referendum activities
which the present Constitution
evoked last year.

A last-minute attempt by some
nursing students to defeat the doc-
ument proved unsuccessful.

The Constitution does not guar-

student government and was cri-
ticized by the nurses for that rea-
son.

Many students were optimistic

about the future of student gov-

The final vote was received with
mixed emotions by those involved
and familiar with the document.

Steve Kaye, chairman of the
Constitutional Review Commit-
tee which drafted the document,

noted with regret the apathy of
this campus.

“I hope the present Constitution
will be workable and that ethical,
competent, and concerned individ-
uals both run for positions in stu-
dent government and vote in next
year's election,” he said.

“Those who voted, still have
hopes for good student govern-
ment,” according to Arnie Stein-
berg, another Review Committee
member. “The vote reflected -the

attitude of people disgusted with -‘

the shoddy way in which student
government was run in the past.”

’ Expressing his dissatisfaction
with the referendum proceedings,
Student Association Social Com-
missioner Lennie Klavonic said,
“It was poorly ‘publicized and I
expected the poor voter turn out.
The Constitution was pushed
through too quickly. There are a
lot of loopholes still to be worked

out. They weren’t. Subsequently, a

it’s not a complete document."

Pat O’Brien, vehement critic
of the‘existing student govern-
ment, said, “Perhaps, we ought
to abolish student government.
The vote indicates that very few
people care."

B uilders” negotiations Ex"’"""“"‘ "'"""id“’

focus on fiscal crisis

by POHLA SMITH
News Edito'r

Instead of negotiating to avoid
a strike of construction workers
threatened when 14 white workers
were laid ‘ off, officials of the
Building Trades Council and Uni-
versity management are address-
ing themselves to the actual cause
of the layoff: the University-wide
fiscal crisis.

Two weeks ago. a strike seem-
ed imminent. Union officials
charged reverse racism and vio-
lation of Union seniority priv-
ileges when white men were laid
off instead of minority workers
with less seniority so the Univer-
sity could honor a pledge to the
Department of Health. Education,
and Welfare to employ minority
workers as part of an Affirmative
Action program.

Now, Leland Deck of the Insur-
ance Office says that “everyone
realizes striking doesn’t solve
the original problem” and that
the racism issue “has simmered
down.” Instead, he said,' both
sides are seeking a solution to
“the curtailment of finances”
which is threatening the security
of other construction workers.

For instance, Deck said that the
one-half million dollar reduction
in the expected allocations receiv-
ed by the Pitt Medical School last
week may force an additional la-
bor cutback.

“The shortage of funds is being -

recognized as the crucial prob-
lem.” Deck said. "It is not a black
versus white. white versus black

- problem."

He said that the laid-off men
andtheir business agents are still
unhappy, but their problems will
be handled on an individual basis

State may bill

HARRISBURG (AP)—The Senate passed and
sent to the House Monday a package of medical
school aid bills which contained a provision that
would require graduates of the schools who prac-
tice in other states to repay the Commonwealth for \

subsidizing their education.

Senate President Pro Tem Martin L. Murray
indicated that the House probably would not accept-
the bills and a conference committee would have to

work out a compromise.

The measure would allocate $21.5 million to the
eightmedical schools. The appropriations are bas-
ed on providing $7,465 for each medical student at
the state-related schools—Temple, Pitt, and Penn
State—-and $4,400 per student for the others—Penn,
Hahnemann, Jefferson Medical College of Pennsyl-
vania and Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Med-

icine.

-versity of Pennsylvania. Sen. Edward Zemprelli,

"by BOB GEDEKOH

 Women must rebel against pro-
grammed education and treat-
’rr_'1e_nt from birth, according to
‘Shirley Chisholm, Democratic
,CCoIigresswoman' from Brooklyn
pivho is a candidate for her party’s
_ "Presidential nomination.

;neg'i_e-"Mellon Student Union Ball-
, llroom Monday, noted that she has
faced more discrimination during
her 31 years in politics because
she is a woman than because she.
_ is black.
 Women, said Chisholm, must
"rebel against the system which in-
 tentionally or unintentionally
' would limit their opportunities in
 any way.
.- ‘_‘.This country sorely needs the
.» utilization of its best brain power
to face modern problems, regard-
less of the sex or race of the con-
,_ gyti/'il;Jutor,” she said. I I

 ‘ ‘Chisholm posed the 'qué§‘ti‘on,

the sanctions that will be placed

on them if they break the rules?”

Heraffirmative answer was “It
I is the women and the young people
, ‘who are going to turn this nation

3 around.
“Few if any Americans are free
ﬁ”"from the psychological wounds of
racism or anti-feminism,” she
“ continued. '

' V She said that the fight against
7 _ discrimination should tie together
women with different ideaologies
and ‘backgrounds into a group with
a common goal.

 .‘ ‘ Chisholm called herself the only
 unique candidate for the Presi-
  dency. She is determined to be an
  important figure to be reckoned

 

 

 

 Chisholm, who spoke at the Car- ‘

" “Are women capable of breaking .

with at the Democratic Conven-
tion in Miami this July.

“I intend to stir things up,” she
said. _
Chisholm revealed plans to en-
ter primary elections in Florida,
North Carolina, Maryland, Wash-
ington, D. C., New York and Cali-
fornia, which she regards as her
strongest states. Lack of funds,

she stated, prevent her from con-

testing in more primaries.

She will enter the southern pri-
maries, she said, ‘because in each
of these states, “four white men”
and, she sarcastically added,
“George Wallace too” will be run-
ning. Chisholm said that they will
split much of the vote, so that she
might emerge the victor. A

She noted that her candidacy
for the Presidency is being un-

derplayed by the national news"

medias, but added that she had
expected this.

If elected, Chisholm promised.

she will enforce immediate with-
drawl from Viet Nam. She said
that the 45 per cent of our tax
money being used in “this un-
just and immoral war” could be
used for social reform.

On the domestic scene, the Con-
gresswoman voiced support for a
guaranteed annual income of $5,-
500 and a system where the ‘poor
will be trained to take jobs rele-
vant to modern society’s needs.
When asked about government
sponsored day care programs, she
said that they should be used as a
means of social change available

to all women regardless of income.

Chisholm cited the need for pris-
on reform, saying that we must
treat prisoners as human beings.

Chisholm blasts sexism

Sheaves of documentation on de-
plorable prison conditions have
been prepared over the years, yet
they have been ignored, she said.

She said that black women and
men should work ~together.to
achieve their goals. The asser-
tiveness and pride of black wom-
en are valuable asset to the move-
ment in America, she continued.

“If whites would give us quality
education we would no longer be
interested in bussing,” she said

 

CHISHOLM
Stirring Things Up

But she expressed amazement
at the number of people who give
lip service to law and order and
yet are willing to disregard or
evade the ruling of the Supreme
Court on this issue.

She termed President Nixon’s
wage-price freeze an extension of
administrative policy favoring
banks and big business. The solu-
tion to the nation’s economic prob-
lems, she said, lies in getting Nix-

" on out of the White House.

i"Ne/w Voters’ pledge

to dump Nixon in "72""

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

Last weekend’s “Emergency
Conference of New Voters,” a
gathering of over 3,000, student
leaders from across the country,
resolved to dump President’Nix-
on in 1972. '

The meeting at Loyola Univer-
sity in Chicago was “an attempt
to establish a youth caucus for the
country,” said Student Associa-
tion Programs ‘Commissioner
Dennis Concilla, who attended the
conference.

Concilla explained that Chicago
was chosen as the setting because
it “represented our worst fears”
in the person of Mayor Daley, and
“our best hopes,” since this was
also the city where Eugene Mc-
Carthy once announced his can-
di dacv for the Presidency.

According to Concilla, the stu-
dents decided.to work actively in
the 1972 election, pledging to vote
only for candidates concerned
with youth-interest issues such as
supporting ecology, and -who come
out against the war, racism, and
related issues.

A resolution was also passed by
the women’s caucus at the confer-
ence, stating that they would only
support those candidates realiz-
ing the unjust treatment of wom-
en. ,
Concilla remarked, however,
that the event “was completely
non-political to the extent that no
candidate was being backed.”

Don Steiner, president of the

Pennsylvania College Young‘

Democrats, was chosen tempor-
ary representative for the Penn-
sylvania delegation to. the Steer-
ing Committee. Each state cau-
cus will elect one man and one
woman to the committee.

The conference was extremely
productive, noted Concilla. How-
ever, he also said a problem arose

when a black caucus led by the

same blacks who took over the
NSA convention “wanted 50 per
cent representation of blacks of
the Steering Committee.” They
eventually walked out when the
demands were not met.

Concilla also noted that dis-
sension existed within the black
group, some speaking against the
conference while others denied
such claims. Puerto Ricans and
Chicanos, he said, similarly
claimed improper representation.

CONCILLA
A Moving Experience

But the students unanimously
approved a resolution establish- A
ing home rule for Indian nations. ’

“The Indian who spoke received
a standing ' ovation. He himself

.was also moved, and said, ‘I just

Want to thank you for hearing me.’
It was really a moving experi-

_ ence,” said Concilla.

A resolution was also passed
petitioning President Nixon to
the Kent State slayings of May 4, 
1970. '

Among the speakers present
were Bella Abzug, Julian Bond,
Allard Lowenstein, and Jesse ‘
Jackson. J

“Jackson made the trip worth- 
while,” recalled Concilla. ’

He mentioned some of the ideas
embodied in Jackson’s speech:
“We have to take the romanticism
out of revolution . . . main ideals
must transcend individual issues
like race and sex . . . we all
hang together or we all hang sep-
arately, that sort of thing,” con-
cluded Concilla.

The conference was sponsored
by the Association of Student Gov-
ernments, of which the Student
Association is not a member. Con-
cilla, however, said he paid for the
trip himself. -

'3 leigh’ candy grabbers

by JOYCE GEMPE RLEIN

I “And what do you want for Christmas?” the voice behind the white
beard asked. _

The girl seated on a red velvet knee answered: “Um . . . how
about that boy over there—the one sitting just to the left of the Cataw-
ba Pink.”

“Elf, write that down,” Santa Claus ordered.

Christtfias, in the form‘ of mistletoe, candy canes, and cookies,
came early to a host of commuters Monday when Santa Claus visited
the Commons Room.

During an annual Christmas party, Jeff Holmes, a senior Political

Science major, disguised himself as the “right jolly old elf.”

Pointing to an empty greencloth sack, Holmes said he had distri-
buted about seven dozen candy canes to those who had enough courage
to sit on his lap. The most popular Christmas request, Holmes revealed.
wasengagement rings.

“It’s funny,” Holmes said, “so many people come over and ask
who is sponsoring our party. We have to say that it is not the effort of
any group. In fact, that’s'the reasoning behind it.”

Holmes said that the idea for the masquerade was initiated last
year when a group of students observed the forced formality and re-
serve of University gatherings.

“When you leave high school, you seem to attend more teas, more
meetings, and more sponsored, sophisticated parties. No one does any-
thing like this anymore within the school because" they decide it isn’t
cool,’’ he explained.

After the line of girls wanting to see him dwindled,*Santa threaded
his way through the dead paper cups, the crushed potato chips, the
plastic mistletoe, and the students, on his way to try to meet the Chan-
cellor.

“Chancellor, what do you want for Chirstmas‘? A light for your
bicycle? Mascara? Cough drops? Ho, ho, ho.”

FASC to deliberate

F rosh Studies advance

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

An innovative program design-
ed to make the freshman year
more exciting and a proposal to
help obtain the necessary funds
for the program will be presented
to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Council for perusal Friday.

The Freshman Studies Program,

which was endorsed by the Col-‘

lege of Arts and Sciences Council
last week, features alternatives
to the traditional course route
taken by freshmen: 1) special
team-taught, four-credit interdis-
ciplinary courses; 2) research
seminars, and'3) the Alternative
Curriculum—a group study pro-
gram worth 15 credits. .-

In addition, the Freshman
Program offers suggestions for
improving programs already
available to freshmen, such as
Orientation program, and sug-

gests that an assistant dean for

Freshman Studies be appointed.

The improvements and imple-
mentation of new projects of
freshman programs will increase
costs of freshman education. In
view of the fiscal crisis squeez-
ing every area of the University,
it appears that obtaining the funds
for the program will be a major

asked the FASC to throw its sup-

pecially earmarked for Freshman
Studies Program.

It has also asked the FAS to de-
liver a mandate to each dean and
department to join in reallo-
cating departmental resources as
necessary.

The impetus for the study by
the Freshman Studies Committee
came from an abortive attempt to
establish the Prologue Program-
an innovative system of freshman
education — designed to provide
“freedom for significant learn‘-
mg.”

The program encountered op-
position on the grounds that it was
of dubious academic reputé.
Dr. John Chapman of the Political
Science Department charged the
program would allow a “non-
learning situation to exist at Pitt.”

Dr. Irwin Schulman of the Po-
litical Science Department argued
that evaluation methods repre-
sented “the heart of the prob-
lem.” Professor Sam Hays of the
History Department also criti-

cized the program as “financial- '

ly off base” and argued it would
drain funds from honors" courses.

ome Schneewind of the College of
Arts and Sciences said that al-
though the opportunities for al-
most any type of intellectual pur-

suit are available, “many oppor- ,.

tunities aren’t used. Students are
indifferent. . . . The faculty finds
students not as interested as they
should be.”

“We all saw in common the re- .

markable uninvolvement of the
college student in his education,”
concurred John Townsend, who
chaired the Freshman Studies
Committee.

The FAS agreed the best place
to start in the attempt to remedy
the situation was with the fresh-
man class. Schneewind said the
faculty needs “to make the fresh-
man year something to get ex-
cited about.” Then, he concluded,
the student will act differently in’
his remaining years of school.

The personalities ihvolved this
year and for the last two are
certainly major factors in the
decline Changing student atti-

spend its last allocation on a
tombstone.

successfully bringing some good
entertainment to Pitt, Lenny
deserves praise.

But too many leaders of stu-

dent government have failed to
exhibit the moral leadership and

responsibility that those in of—’

fice should show. Wade Lawson
is one of these disappointments;
Lenny is another. Dennis Con-
cilla is, I’m glad to report, an
exception. Ted Michalik has
shown more apathy than the
average student and he’s'the

courses at Pitt, English 145 and
English 147. Many universities
have complete schools of journa-
lism, leading to a journalism de-
gree.

The English department is firm-
ly in opposition to holding addi-
tional classes on the topic. Dean
Jerome Schneewind, who prides
himself on being the students’
friend, dismisses journalism as a
“trade”, and asserts that he’s
not about to make the College
of Arts and Sciences into a trade

the need for journalism, most of”

the educators here deserve strong ,

condemnation for not following
through on numerous promises
that “only students can inno-
vate.”

In conclusion, I can‘only hope
that you, students, are reading
the Pitt News with some regu-
larity. It’s free, generally very
painless to read, and I think
worth your time. That’s why
we’ve been working here.

IF C president seeks

modified Greek image

by VIRGINIA COOK

The new president of the In-
terfraternity Council said that
he would like to publicize and
promote the Greek system more
during his one-year term.

Noting that fraternity members
have a higher cumulative aver-
age that non-Greeks, a good in-
tramural athletic program, and
a large number of members
active in student activities, Rich
Josselson said he will seek to
change the beer-drinking-frater-
nity member stereotype image
that he believes exists now.

Admitting that many students.»
may originally join fraternities

to meet girls, drink beer, and
get a good seat at football gam-
es, Josselson said that they soon
became involved in living among
the brothers, studying together,

-and working on projects such as

donating blood and collecting
money for Children’s Hospital.

Josselson, a junior English ma-
jor from New Jersey, stressed
the part Greeks play in campus
activities.

"For the first time this year,
he said, “Chancellor Posvar ask-
ed the Greeks to organize Par-
ents’ Weekend. It was more
successful under, our direction
than it has ever been, and the
Chancellor was pleased.”

When asked to comment on
this fall’s “dry” (no alcohol)
rush, Josselson said, “Dry rush
was a necessity this fall because
of the complaints of some Oak-
land residents on Bayard Street."

Noting that the complaints had
been resolved through meetings
between the community and the
fraternities involved, Josselson
said that the possibility of hav-
ing a "wet’? rush will be dis-
cussed and decided within the
next few days.

Although Josselson said he had I

not seen all the plans for a pro-

posed high rise fraternity com-
plex, he said, “I would be in fav-
or of it with some modifications.
Pointing out that the complex
could be converted into a dormi-
tory if one of the fraternities
closes, that room size is fixed,
that kitchen space is shared, and
that the University will be charg-
ing parking fees in the Corn-
plex’s garage, Josselson said the

' plan deserves further discussion.

There are 17 fraternities in the
IFC, among them a black fra-
ternity, Alpha Phi Alpha.

“I think the black fraternities
are excellent,” Josselson said,
“We can learn a lot from them
just as they can learn a lot from
us.”

As president of the IFC, Jos-
selson will be a decision-making
member of the Student Affairs
Advisory Committee. ‘Also, as a
member of the IFC advisory co_m_-
mittee, he will investigate ‘ap-
plications of fraternity members
for loans to defray the cost of
fraternity membership.

Josselson was initiated as IFC
President last night, replacing
Paul Symczak. '

Other IFC officers include
External Vice . President Robert
Stack, Internal-
dent Brian Berlyon, Secretary
Dngglas Shaffer, and Treasurer
Chuck‘Steeber.

Day care questionnaire readieidr

by CAROLEICOVAL

“As a student, faculty member
or staff person, do you need day
carefacilities for your children?
If so, where, what times, and for
what age children?” ‘

These questions will be ask-
ed in a January questionnaires de-
signed"’to fill the gaps in the’
specific information needed by
the Daycare Proposals Commit-
tee to investigate the possibility
of a center here.

Clyde 0. McDaniel, Associ-
ate Professor in the Graduate
School of Social Work, design-
ed the questionnaire, which will
be distributed to a significant
sampling of Pitt students. Along
with a team of graduate re-
searchers, McDaniel hopes to
find some specific answers to
the Committee’s queries.

mM_C_l)‘aniel__”said that since the’
Graduate School of Social Work
is ' naturally interested in'day
care, it welcomed the opportun-
ity to investigate student needs
and interest. ’

Faculty and staff personnel
will be polled through the office
and resources of Dr. Edward
Blakely, Assistant to Chancellor
Posvar and Director of the Af-
firmative Action Program.

Public interest on the campus

facilities has already prompted

Coon views Write On not as a
termpaper factory but as a re-
search opportunity.

Papers given to students are on
a xeroxed copy, he said. and must
be re-typed. Write On, said Coon,
urges students to rework papers,
telling customers not to just hand
the text in, but also to use it as a
source.

But given such good sources
(most papers are "A” and "B“).
some students don’t feel/the ex-
plicit need of rewriting the pa-
pers. 4

Coon justified the sometime use
of the papers in this way by say-
ing that “if a professor is running
his class the way it should be run,
there would be ‘no reason for pa-
pers to be bought.” "

Coon admitted that his firm "is
providing a crutch for kids
press-ed for time."

He added that the “majority of
students are in for a degree” and
are not likely to have interest in
every subject they take.

. so charged’

 

The morality of termpaper
firms is, of course, subject to de-
bate. .

An editorial in the Michigan‘

State News condemned term pa-
per firms this way:

“While previously students

yond the scope of the average‘ pro-
t'essor’s coping abilities.

“Academic dishonesty hurts
one’s fellow students who don’t
cheat. destroys the professor-stu-
dents relationship and deprives

‘one of the chance to learn. but

with outside pressures 'to get _a
degree’ combined with budding
capitalists’ ready-made papers,
it poses a greater threat than ever
to the University." -

In a letter to the editor, Coon
countered, “But what’ does the
State News have to say about
those average students — our cus-

tomers?” he asked. “They are
‘the inept, the’ lazy and the disas-
ter stricken.’ . ., . (Referred to in
the editorial) . . . It takes a lotta
guts to sit in your office in Stu-
dent Services (being one of the
lucky ones, perhaps, who actually
enjoys, this educational experi-
ence) and pontificate to 40,000
harassed and beleaguered stu-
dents on the subject of academic
dishonesty. ’ '

“Did it ever occur to you that
there are a lot of people here who
never quite made the Honor «So-
ciety, who have to work very hard

for that stupid degree and who
could use a helping hand? Dis-
aster-stricken, indeed!”

Dr. Jerome Schneewind, dean
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences, said that “if somebody gets
a whole termpaper written by
somebody else it is a very serious
offense of academic integrity?’

Schneewind criticized services
of this type calling them "the
worst form of dishonesty I can
think of.”

He said termpaper firms “can-
not be tolerated by the Universi-

John Pfeil, discjockey of the ’

new radio show Nocturnal Vibra-
tions, may not exactly play lulla-
bies, buthe may satisfy the night-
time appetitesl of rock music lov-
ers. -

Premiering this week on the
city’s newest radio" station,
WLSW (103.9 FM), the program
will broadcast from midnight to 6
a.m. and feature hard rock.

Vibrations, according to Pfeil,
will be devoted almost entirely to
music. ’

“There will be a very low ad-
vertising campaign trip and no
newsat this point,” be related.

Occasionally, Pfeil plans to

_ sopinionize, but he ?‘will not try to

get too ‘philosophical, and will
state my views within regulations.

“I’1l talk mostly about music,”
he said, “Then_I’ll talk about the
‘community and aspects of socie-
ty.”

Pfeil intends to include -news in
his format eventually but em-
phasized that it won’t be until
such endeavors are well-coordi-
_ nated.

“Newscasts will be 10 minutes
long, covering five subjects or
less, and I will create an environ-
ment to back up the news,” he
said. “But it must be important
news, something worth telling
somebody about'.’

Regular newscasts, said Pfeil, ‘

will be part of the daytime pro-

gramming. ‘

Sen. Patrick J. Stapleton, D._—

said they were aimed at keeping

The Pennsylvania Medical So-

ciety, which opposed the repay-
ment, urged legislators by letter
to form a study commission on
the problem. ‘

“The intent of the amendment.
is laudable and action certainly is
overdue, but a sampling of stu-
dent reaction indicates the
amendment would have an effect‘
directly opposite to the intended
one,"’ said Society President
George P. Rosemond of Philadel-
phia.

During this part of the program,
Pfeil said he will speak, for ex-

ample, with musicians, since
“they are some of the most inter-
esting people.”’ .

‘As for‘ the station, as.a whole,

. Pfeil explained, its main objective

is to be “community oriented."

V “There is a need for people to
hear good music," he said, “and

daytime programming will in-_

clude anything kind of format un-
der the sun, from ‘AM rock_ to re-
ligious mus.ic topolka.”

A’ newcomer to radio, Pfeil at-
tended “different schools and
majored in the Arts.” His inter-
ests lie in music, production, and
managing, and he hopes’ later to
break into other areas of the com-
munications industry.

Although-he admits that 12 ‘mid-

Commuters approve Constitiition

by MARY WELTY

A Commuter Association Con-
stitution proposing a judiciary
board to supervise elections, im-
peachrnents, and constitutional-
ity questions was approved unan-
imously at a general meeting
Monday afternoon.

However, because attendance
at the meeting was small, a re-
ferendum on the Constitution will
be held January 12, during Com-
muter Association (CA) elections.

The judiciary "board would con-
sist of officers and-committee
chairmen and co-chairmen of

the Association (CA) who are
seniors. The main purpose of this
board would be to supervise the
annual CA-elections to prevent
illegitimate voting by non~mem-
bers. . ,

The judicial board and a rede-
finition of membership eligi-
bility are the only major chang-
es proposed for this Constitution
as from last year’s.

“All members of the Univer-

sity community who commute.

may become members of the
CA,” reads the new document.

FASC considers program’

job was also made.

The CA has made a plea
through Chancellor Posvar to
acquire two additional bus shel-
ters. It also has asked the Pro-
vost that the school be closed on

winter days when‘ a sizable ac-

cumulation of snow has fallen.

The next meeting of the CA
will be January 5 at which*nom-
inations for the annual elections
will be accepted.

“Presidential rhetoric.”

To insure students work and
make progress under this system,
they would be required to submit
at least four written evaluations
of their work from at least three
faculty members with whom they
have worked during the term.

Students would be granted 15
credits only after all the written
evaluations were turned in. Those
who do not actively participate in’
the program or who receive poor
evaluations would risk loss of
some of all their credits.

Students in the Alternative Cur-
riculum would also be permitted
to take up to two traditional
courses which they could take ei-
ther for a letter grade or on the
credit/no entry basis.

The CASC proposes that all the
new curriculum options be sub-
ject to continuous evaluation by
the Office of Measurement and
Evaluation for a period of four
years. '

It also proposes that the entire
program be presented to the en-
tire Faculty of Arts and Sciences
for a vote in January.

revitalizes Fine Arts
 by ANDREA CAPLAN

: Professor Donald Gordon, chairman of the University’s Fine Arts
J-Department, terms his role expanding human thought: “Teaching in
the humanities must make the art object ‘come alive’ for the student.
 .,The- real challenge in teaching, as I see it, is to help the student
bridge the transcultural gaps in space and time, so that he can respond
‘:5, say, a Bernini sculpture as readily as he can to, say, a Beatles’
; record.” »

_ From afar, Gordon appears a formidable figure. His mind cannot
 b‘e-‘easily fathomed or categorized. Striving to achieve oneness—-of the
mundane and the spiritual, the fleeting and the timeless—he acts out his
1‘tog"ether” beliefs when he teaches. .

. Ahush falls upon the auditorium as he moves across the floor, an
_, ctor on a stage, dramatizirig an idea through bodily gestures. Elo-
-ijuently speaking of “gut reactions” to make a point, Gordon can /be
" iamiliar and crude though he is, more often, formal and aesthetic.

 Gordon encourages students to meet him on a one-to-one basis; one
nevertheless approaches a first appointment with him fearingthe un-
"7 known. Relaxed by Gordon’s calm and serious manner, one is struck
i._.by the professor's dedication to art history—and- also his sincere in-
‘, terest in his students. ‘

 g ' Dynamic and removed on the platform, he proves pensive and
‘and warm in_person. “I findist difficult to. r.elate.to.students as a pal or
“buddy,” he says, “but I find itnatural to relate as a father figure.”

According to Gordon,» “Any teaching method is legitimate,” with

 Art history attains universal relevance when it gives meaningful
;visions of human experience. “If~a panicked and deeply disturbed so-
‘’‘ciety calls Van Gogh ‘mad,’ do we criticize that society, or that artist?
n-short, I-believe not in art for art’s sake, but in art for mankind’s
./sake,” Gordon explaiins . ‘

‘ Describing Munch’s expressionist painting “The Scream,” he
jspeaksof the loneliness at sunset when “nature screams” and man suf-

NEW YORK (AP) ~ If you’re
tired of giving those cliches like
His and Her airplanes for Christ-
mas, all it takes is a little imag-
ination and a lot of money to dis-
tribute some unusual offerings
this year.

The catalogues supply the imag-
ination. You provide the money.

For ._instance how about an
equine antique——a 41 inch high
wooden horse, carved’ in approxi-
mately 1650? It’s $2,000 and
there’s not much chance of your
gift being duplicated.

Something a little more mod-
est?«For the kids a hot dog cart,
complete with striped umbrella,
heating unit and ice storage box.
It’s only $1,295. But the mustard
comes extra.

You can’t make a silk purse out
of a sow’s ear, but somebody has
made an evening bag out of a hol-
lowed-out coconut. It’s the real
thing, polished, and with gold-

, toned "fittings and chain handle. It

costs $125 to play this shell game.
And speaking of the exotic,

there’s an “authentic fake” ele-

phant tail hair bracelet in solid.

tenentic, authentic” thing for $12.

but self-confidence, the perfect
present for a better future is the
“instant ego rebuilder’,’I_’ress the

him with a musical spoon, shock

Finally for the person you’ve
decided to give nothing to this
year: The Nothing Box. It does
nothing but blink its eight lighted
eyes in random pattern for nearly

a year. Then it’s dead, but by that

time the new gift catalogues will
be out with a new profusion of
wonders.

,‘Papillon' chronicles
 penal colonyhorror

J

K’

by GEORGE C. STEITZ
Papillon, 458 pp.
“Pocket Books” Paperback $1.95.
PAPILLON is the often elec-
trifying, sometimes grotesque,
thoroughly sensitive account of
Henri Charriere’s 14-year strug-
gle to escape from a French pen—
al colony.

An innocent man convicted of
murder and sentenced to hard
labor for life, Charriere, known
as “Butterfly” to the French un-
derworld, began his term in 1931.
Not until 36 years later did he
record his horrendous experienc-
es.

Framed. by police, and -victim- ‘

ized by-the injustice of ‘a Paris
court, he was interned at French
_Guiana in the company of "the
motherland‘s most dangerous
criminals.”

Writing in hot-blooded detail,
the author condemns us, along
with him, to stinking dungeons
infested by giant centipedes; sub-
jects us to months of excruciat-
ing silence in the pits of soli-

tary confinement; plays for us"

the dissonant music of whips,
cracking bones and chewing
flesh.

But bitterness‘ and" hatred of
his oppressors did not mar
Charriere’s rationality. He in-
geniously planned and amazing-
ly conducted a series of bold es-
Acape parties, called "cavales”,
gaining his freedom for several
months, costing him severe pun-
ishment, and providing us with a
magnificent-chronicle of excite-
ment.

On his first "cavale", he lived.

with a Guajira Indian tribe which
he studied in the style of Marg-
aret Mead, with sociological
, skill and enthusiasm.

Recaptured by the French, the
author endured two years of sol-
itary. confinement, unfolding a
frightening picture of man’s

, corrosion in complete isolation. g

Miraculously [winning his _bat-
tle with derangement, he was re-

' leased back into the colony, soon

attempted a second “cavale” and
suffered 18 more solitary months.

~-5;‘? V ‘ Enormous insects and tenacious

rats his sole companions in almost
total darkness, be devised a daily
routine to maintain his sanity.
Splitting himself into two func-
tions, he walked for several hours
without resting, blanking out all
thoughts; once completely ex-
hausted, he stretched out on his
wooden bunk (equipped with
wooden pillow) and set his mind
in flight.

I Other prisoners were not so for-
tunate, many spending ' wild
nigh.ts’of lunacy ending in des-

parate suicide.

As if the man knew that per-
serverance would someday lead

 ﬂto his deserved freedom, the "ca-

  

vales” continued} he did not give
up. Papillon is an epic of man’s
will to survive, even under the
most inhuman conditions.

With the outrage of Jean Gen-
et, Charrierev exclaims that he
cannot believe libertarian France
supported such a barbarous pen-
al system where those responsible
must have been “loathsome mon-

sters, vicious and cunning psy-
copaths . . .”

He has not consciously design-
ed a social commentary, nor has
he diluted his saga with tiresome
politics. But the reader may still
be haunted by thoughts of mod-
ern Folsoms, San Quentins, and
Atticas,' three decades after the
author’s 14-year nightmare.

Papillon asks us to imagine the
horrors of incarceration, the mis-
erable assault on -the prisoner’s
identity, the disregard for an in-
dividual’s rehabilitation. He be-
lieves that our lives are consum-
ed with “a hunger for greater
comfort and the constant struggle
to achieve it. -All that kills the
soul, ‘kills compassion, understand-
ing, nobility. It leaves no time
for caring what happens to other

people, least of all criminals,"

Although, reports-the author,
he did not go into “that hell”
with a typewriter, his thoughts
come back to assail him with
"terrible clarity” and are as ac-
curate as he could possibly make
them.

Charriere has recorded his ad-
venture for our interest and en-
tertainment; but he has also ex-
posed his deepest emotions and
moral convictions. The result is
a powerful; believable book.

In The Real Inspector Hound,
he has blended a parody of the English mystery
thriller with a satire on theater critics to create a
comic nightmare on the fine line between. illu-

Let's Get It «Straight  

WIIO SAYS S0?

QUESTION: Why should I believe in a God I can’t see, just
because some preacher tells me _I‘ should? What virtue is

there in a faith like that?

Aivswzn:

To believe merely on some-N

one else’s say-so is not the
basis of Christian faith, nor
is that What gives it merit in
God’s eyes. The Bible says

that God has chosen to save '

through “preaching” those
who are willing to believe. If
and when any preacher pro-
claims the truth about God,
then God’s own Holy Spirit
speaks through him to those
who have open hearts and
minds.

If you will listen in that
way to .a man who faithfully
preaches the Bible, God will
speak through him to your
heart. The first thing‘ His
Holy Spirit will do is -to con-
vict you of being a sinner.

/ Remember, it is no longer
the. preacher you are listen.-

Children believe in that fashion. “My father says
so” is proof enough for them up to a certain age.’ p
they discover that Mom and Dad arenot infallible, and they

begin to ask questions. Though this is hard on parents,
children must learn to think for themselves.

Then

ing to,‘ but the voice of G
in your soul.

The second thing the Holy
Spirit will show you is that
you must accept Christ's
death as the basis for your
salvation, that you must rely
on His atonement for your
sins. You are free to disbe-
lieve any of man's remedies
for sin, but when the Holy
Spirit brings the truth home
to your heart, you reject it
at the cost of your‘ own soul.

On the other hand, if you
believe in Christ as your Sav-
iour, for time and for eter-
nity, you are not being a
credulous fool, but are exer-
cising faith in the witness of
God’s Holy Spirit to your own _
heart. Then, and only then,
is faith a virtue. “ - _ '—

» mers program had reached its ‘lowest ebb. -In the course of

one year an amazing rebirth has occurred.

There are many obvious differences between last year’s
swim team and this year’s: spirit,dedication and a real gen-
uine will to win are a few.

The spirit of this squad far overshadows that of the
previous teams as exemplified in Saturday’s meet with
Clarion State. Coach Richard Bradshaw explained that the
meet would be an “emotional one.”

The members of the team knew that Clarion State was
sporting a two year undefeated streak in dual meet compe-
tition. They also knew that there wasn’t any definite dif-
ference in the quality of either team. So the team with

' the most heart or as some people call it, ‘guts’, would win

the meet. r

But one more added ingredient spelled the difference‘
in the score, confidence. Unbelievable as it may seem they
showed confidence in themselves and the team.

“It was a team effort,” coach Bradshaw explained,.
“and no one let us down.”

. Bradshaw mentioned that he was worried the freshmen
might choke in their first varsity meet. They didn’t, partly

_ due to the confidence and the spirit displayed by the sen-
..iors on the team.  -» N 2:-~. V‘ r  — _
David " Anderson, Richard Rowe,£Fnéd Lewis and
.Mark-Cohen :-- all seniors, bettered 'or.nearly »equal,ed= the

“That shows we werenever in shape last year,” quip-
ped Mark Cohen on seeing the times posted. “Seniors usu-
ally don’t have as good a time as they had their junior
year.” ' ‘

‘Another frosh Tom Smith pulled up right behind Hayes
in the 50 free. ‘ -

Time and againl‘the‘ freshmen were complimenting the
seniors and at times upstaging them. At the end of the meet
‘to show how m_uch team enthusiasm there really was, they
all had a hand in tossing Bradshaw in the pool in jubila-
tion.

Out of the pool the enthusiasm didn’t dry up. There
was a ‘reception in the Trees lounge following the meet for
the swimmers and also on hand, setting a precedence, were
recruits.

“I’ve never seen recruits here since my freshman year,” -

Cohen commented

All of the swimmers earnestly enjoyed taking these
prospects around campus and even accommodating them in
their rooms or apartments. The air was electric with the
knowledgeable realization that their labors will continue
the type of performance’ in'Saturday’s meet for years to
come. ‘ - . V

Bishop Coach Frank Shannon
was apologetic after the runa-
way. "Thank goodness this is the
last time we play a major schbol

.this year,” _he remarked. “Our

kids had some trepidation about
playing Pitt, and we didn’t play
as well as we can. Buzz Ridl is
one of the nicest men-they could
have scored 200 points on us.”

Shannon referred to Panther
Coach Ridl’s usage of the entire
Panther squad to a great extent.
After the eventual outcome was
clearly obvious in the first half,
Ridl freely substituted.

i “It was*a good game for us
after the North Carolina loss,”
said Ridl after the game. “It was

‘good work for. the subs even -'

Six Cats hit in double figures,
including Carl Morris, Paul
O’Gorek, Mike Paul, Kent
Scott, Mickey Martin, and Mar-
vin Abrams, with Morris and
0’Gorek tying for top honors
with 14. Morris also was high
with rebounds (11) as the Pan-
thers dominated the boards at
both ends of the court.

More evidence of the Panth-

' ers’ height advantage was that
they had blocked more Bishop v

shots than the actual number of
baskets scored by_ the Ohioans,
midway through the first half.
Additionally, the Cats usually
had several chances on tip-ins
and offensive rebounds to com-
pensate for missed distance
attempts. ’

The Pitt Hockey Club, show-
ing ‘the effects of three weeks
off the ice, stumbled to a 2-1 vic-
tory over the skaters of St. Vin-

 

ers could not seem to get any
sort of organized attack going
during the first one and a half
periods.

Their lack of ice time in the
past three weeks was obvious
as the passing and skating of the

Pitt, the St. Vincents skaters
were having a tough time organ-
izing also, and the first period

' ended in a 0-0 stalemate.

St_. Vincents quickly altered the
situation, as "it scored on a
breakaway early in the second
period.

The lead‘ stood-until the mid-.

dle of the period .when'defense-
man Duke Sheaffer took a pass
from his partner on defense, Ker-
ry Browne, and rifled a slap
shot from the blue line to beat
the St. Vince/nts goalie.

With the score tied at ’1-1, Pitt
finally picked up momentum and
a few minutes later lit the red
lamp for the eventual winning
tally. ‘

This time it was center ice-
man Bill Glenville, stationed in
front of the net, taking a pass
from Denny Browne. Browne
had taken the puck into the corn-‘
er before firing it out to Glen-
ville.

Glenville then faked the de-
fense out of position and slipped
the puck into the open side of the
cage. It was the assistant cap-
tain’s third goal of the campaign.

The third period was marked
by an unusual number of penal-

‘ties, as the officials had been

free throws after the other.

“We hadn’t been setting up well on of-

two crucial turnovers we really let the game
get out of hand.”

After that decisive minute, the Cubs led
71-63.

Simultaneously, the frosh slowed down
the pace, resulting in numerous Greensburg
fouls. The Cubs converted on all six of their

tournament and is a two-year letter winner. How-
ever, he himself admits that he was fortunate to
perform against Michigan.

f‘Gary McClure beat me in eliminations last
week, 3-0,” explained Wylie. “Then, Buddy Smeltz,
our regular 142 pounder, quit the team, and I got an-
other chance.” i —

A natural 134 pounder (he weighed in at 139
against King), Wylie copped fourth place .at the
Chattanooga Open over Thanksgiving, dropping only
two decisions to two highly regarded Oklahoma
State matmen. Dave wants to wrestle at 134 for the
upcoming Lehigh quadrangular, Dec. 17-18.

 
 
 

(FOURTH IN THE 1970 EIWA tournament at ‘I34 pounds, Pitt's Dave Wylie H
_is shown tying up the legs of Michigan's Mork King. Wylie posted an ex-
citing 7-6 triumphlast Saturday in the grqpplers’ season opener.

“The quad should be a real good tournament
for ‘us. There will be some topflight competition
there, particularly from Oregon State. This meet
will let the team know'how tough we are.

 

nipped Michigan’s Mark. King, 7-6. Unfortunately"

formance, Dave does not feel that this post places

wedlockas wrestling   and

‘‘I’ll get a chance to tryout again for 134 this
week sometime. Who knows? If Randy Payne’s
shoulder doesn’t come around, Coach (Adams)
might have Gary (McClure) go at 126 for the quad.”

Wylie surprised some people this summer by
marrying his girl friend of.the past several years.
Nevertheless, the young groom insists his marri-
age has probably helped both his wrestling and his
studies.

Wylie asserted, "Marriage has been great. If
anything, it has helped my concentration on wrest-
ling. Academically, I’m getting some of my best
grades ever this term.”

Alr_eady setting his sights on a possible 1972
Eastern title (Feb. 25-26 at Temple), Dave is just
as confident about Pitt’s opportunity of grabbing
the EIWA team championship.

“I plan on placing in the Easterns. Andy Tolk
(1971 titlist from Navy) and Lenny Pruzansky
(Penn) will be the toughest competition at‘ 134.

“While I’ve been at Pitt, the team has never
done well at the Easterns. This year, every guy on
our squad can place. Fuddy (George Bryant), Ran-
dy (Payne), and Kevin Love all have algood shot at
winning.”

Defeated in the 1971 EIWA’ tourney by Dave
Waters, Ilehigh’s eventual fourth place finish/er,
Wylie realizes how demanding tournaments are. ‘E

“I think I was about equal in ability with the

fourplace winners (1971 Easte_rns),” ‘said Wylie.
“I didn’t wrestle badly against Waters.

If Dave Wylie proves to be an accurate seer,‘
perhaps thg Panther matmen will finally capture

that elusive EIWA team trophy.-

by MARTY HELLMAN

Associate Sports Editor
Unitili last Saturday evening,
Panther fans’ knowledge about
Billy Knight’s ability was limited
to conjecture, rumor, and re-

‘memberances of his high school
. career.

Now, after two home games, it
is evident that Knight can and yvill
fulfill previous speculation and
the partisan Panther rooters visi-
bly sense it.

His missed shots draw unusual-
ly loud groans, while his dazzling
plays elicit frenzied cheering. Ev-
eryone marvels at his balance, co-
ordination, and gracefulness on
the court, and his deft ball-han-
dling. .

This is the first year for Knight
in a Pitt uniform, due to ineligi-
bility as a freshman last year. Un-
fortunately, Billy was unable to

‘project a NCAA required aver-

..i .'H

   

 

age to participate as a freshman
but he has done will academically
since entering school.

He admits that the missed year
hindered him a bit. “It hurt me
because I played without officiat-
ing all year. I was forcing shots
that I may not have taken in a
game.

Despite lack of college expos-

ure, Knight was tabbed for honor-
able mention All-American by na-

tional magazines, mainly on the,

strength of his All-American per-
formances at Braddock High
School for three years.

Knight naturally received num-
erous scholarship offers, but
chose Pitt for two main reasons.

“My family wanted me to stay
near home, and after I visited
about six or seven schools, I de-
cided that it was better here.”

Realizing everyone’s expecta-
tions, Knight admits that he felt

        

“I think

that in our
lifetime. a

man without

a gun is a tool...
When l was a
child. I thought as
a child: now that
I'm a man l still
think as a child.”

pressured at the outset. “I was
really nervous before the Gettys-
burg game and especially North
Carolina. Ifelt the pressure after
the games also.”

Presently, Knight feels his ma-
jor weakness is playing Pitt’s
zone defense. “I’m not used to let-
ting , a man. go behind me for
someone else to cover him.”

Knight possesses a rather un-
usualy nickname—Mooney. Bill
recalls its origin way back in jun-
ior high.

“One of the reasons for it was
because I have a round shaped
head,” he laughed. “Also, I used
to have a really high arc to my
shots when I played on courts in
the back alleys.”

Billy ‘enthusiastically foresees
a promising year for the Pan-
thers. “We have a good chance to
go to a post-season tourney, but
we’ll have to be careful of not be-
ing upset by somebody like Get-

tysburg while we’re trying to up- I  I '

set someone else.” .

Before the season began, Coach‘
Buzz Ridl appraised Knight’s abil-
ity by sayingj’ With experience,
there’s no telling how good Bill
Knight can be.”

Post season tourneys and na-

tional rankings have been absent «

from Pitt basketball for eight
years. Breaking that trend in the
next three years may eventually
be a reflection of h-ow good
Mooney does become.

   

ANDY VIARI-IOL : “Tell do Antonio to say what-

ever he likes about the picture. It's great.”
VINCENT OANBY, N. Y. 11MES: “...superior '

.fi,cti°n.. as. imahgaggleéas,‘

.qu - _
mysterious as ant

arisen Tragedy: as
ome Again,’ as funny

as ‘Why Are Wein Viet Nam?’ and as banal as

‘Main Street.‘ "

PHILIP ROTI-I: “Nothing so comically
grotesque as Nixon’s transformation ‘into a
President has happened since Kafka’s hero
turned into a cockroach; MILLHOUSE
faithfully records that horrible American

metamorphosis.”

LEONARD HARRIS, WCBS TV: “One thing is
sure...as you watch...the campaigns against
Voorhis, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Stevenson,
Kennedy, Humphrey, the Hiss case...the farewell
speech in California...as you watch, you'll be chortling
or turning. No one will sleep through MILLHOUSE"

JULES FEIFFER: “A zapped portrait of Nixon‘ -

from Voorhls to Vietnam: part camp, part
I-loratio Alger run amuck—the dark side of
the American dream.”

KEVIN SANDERS, WABC TV: “It's probably the
most devastating attack on one man ever put

together on film."

ALBERT GOLDMAN: ‘“Mlllhouse’ is funnier‘
than any current comedy. The only sad thing

is its truth.”

JERRY PARKER, NEVISDAY: “. . . howlingly _funny
...a film to make you wish we didn't have Nixon to

kick around any more."

JAMES A. VIECI-ISLER, N. Y. POST: “...tho
predominantly young, anti-establishment
audience howled with a kind of ecstatic

laughter."

JAY COOKS, TIME MAGAZINE: “A funny likeness
of the 37th President Nixon seems to emerge as the
kind of bunko artist of whom W. C. Fields

always ran afoul.”
