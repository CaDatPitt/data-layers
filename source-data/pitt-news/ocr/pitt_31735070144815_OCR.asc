The next timeyou see‘ Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg looking down at his

phone, there is a good chance hes tex— '

ting his feelings to the woﬂd.

‘In. a statement released Monday,
Nordenberg said he started  Twit-
ter, an online social networking Web
site, to let students and faculty “follow

‘  every move”

Nordenbetg, who became the ﬁrst
University chancellor in the country to
join the site, said it has  his life

‘Twitter makes me feel young
again,” he said “I feellike I’m connect-
ing with students on the most personal
level” P I

100 times a day, Nordenbétg allows
people to see what he’s  at al-

most any time
And, for Nordenberg, it’s 
he could have  -
Although he joined Twitter on

Monday, N ordenberg needed the help _‘

of two students before he ﬁnally ﬁg-

“When I heard that he was 
to join Twitter, I couldn’t pass up the
chance to help him,” said senior Katie

Nordenberg and Plants agreed that
the hardest part about using Twitter
was choosing a username ’

Because i“TheChancello1” and

‘WlrBigShot’ ’ were both taken, Plants
_ suggested “Nordenbutgh,” and the.

name stuck _ .
Once signed up, Nordenberg’s ﬁrst

I To bolster school spirit, Pitt armaartced that ‘it will replace the falcortsanetaary -
on top of the Cathedral with a live panther. Molly Greertartd Dave Beitzel debate.

In favor: Molly Green, lobbyist for the Pro-American Activities Association
Against: Dave Beitzel, senior correspondent for interspecies love

 

 Beitzel keeps throwing around bigwords like.“rights,” “Constitu-
tion” and “habitat,” but don’t be fooled by his liberal rhetoric. Listen, the fact is, in

MOlly: I want to open up by clarifying that falcons, are,  fact, not endangered,
as my peyote-smoking, rat—loving colleague will attempt to prove. There have been

. numerous studies funded by the PA and researched by myself at the Pittsburgh Zoo

that prove this. For example, there are more falcons
in Pittsburgh than  boars, which actually have an
overpopulation problem, so you do the math. ’ ‘
Second, and this burns my heart down to its deepest
"P caverns, the young people of this country have lost
touch with true America. Girls studying to be engi-
neersl? Boys studying to be nursesl? It used to be that
 the younger generation cared about important things,
  like getting rich,‘world domination and Christmas. Now
I see them out and aboutriding their bikes and taking
French classes with their little Nalgene bottles. It’s
disgusting. Clearly what this University needs is a makeover, a pro—American makeover.
The falcon is a sissy animal. Also, in Russia they love falcons. The sport of falconry

 

was pretty much inventedthere. Clearly that means falcons are a communist animal. '
What we need is an American animal. Like the panther! The panther is at the top of _ ,

the food chain, it’s got all the speed and prowess of Jeff Gordon, and you will never,
ever see a panther caught dead in Russia. . ’

DQVC: This is erratic Republican swill at its worst. Your party had eight years to

change the animal, but it wasn’t until our new president took ofﬁce that you seemed to‘

care. Harboring an animal that wasn’t our mascot was a problem that Barack Obama
inherited.'We can’t just unroost those majestic creatures from their home now. Those
falcons have rights, just like people. Or do you hate the Constitution, ina’am?

This totalitarian action won’t stand. You can expect that I’ll be Tweetingi about it,

and I’m starting a Facebook group. So get ready for some e—mails full of piss and '

vinegar. We won’t just let you destroy. these falcons’ habitat. If they can’t live on the
Cathedral, where will they go? ' _

I rented a documentary on Netflix. about how corporations destroy America; es-
pecially its rainfores_ts. I didn’t really watch it, but it had a powerful soundtrack

America we don’t do handouts. These falcons, these elitist, devil—worshiping falcons,
think they are just entitled to the Cathedral roof. No sir, they can just ﬂy right on back
where they came from. The panthers can’t help it if God is on their side. Listen, you
give a falcon a ﬁsh, it eats for a day. You teach a falcon to ﬁsh, it eats for a lifetime. So
really, we’re doing the falcons a favor by kicking them off the Cathedral. Teach the
little featherheads to live on their own. A I

And as for Mr.‘ Beitzel’s supposition that corporations destroy America? Well, I
suppose he thinks global warming is a real thing, too. These are myths created by
the liberal» media and its granola—radicals. They are fallacious, drug-induced, socialist,
anti—Ar”ne.rican lies.

Dave: These falcons can’t just pull themselves up by their talons. They have

, feathers, not ﬁngers and bootstraps. But can we talk about the issues? Americans want

to hear about the issues. A
With all due respect, my_ fascist, pro—death colleague

Sometimes it’s difﬁcult being a Democrat in such a.
conservative city. Thankfully, there’s a liberal professor
at"this‘campus, and he warned me about animal dis— ‘
crimination, such as when students are all like, “That
was ,bad news bears.” Everyone says this, taking it for
granted that bears are bad. But bears can be good news,
like when you say, “Hey, bear, thanks for the salmon. I
really appreciate it, bro. Peace.” Unlike panthers, people
can outrun bears, but I prefer to just hug them. _ _

Falcons need hugs too‘ —— they’re practically down. In order to do that, we need

To the Editor, -

I completely agree with the City Council’s decision to ban porch couches in Pittsburgh. Couches should
not be allowed outside under any circumstances whatsoever because they could be lit on ﬁre by unruly college
students. College students light everything on ﬁre to celebrate even the most minor of occurrences — I was at
a birthday party last week, and someone actually lit the cake on ﬁre and then forced the birthday girl to blow it

-out! And placing them on wooden porches only makes it worse, because a porch is connected to the house and
made of wood, which burns when it’s on ﬁre and then could catch the house on ﬁre with ﬁre. _ '

.As for those naysayers who might bring’ up the minor point that some porches are made of stone, stone is
just as much of a threat. I can’t exactly prove this point, but you should trust me that it is because I’m a com-
munications major and I know how to write _a persuasive argument,_as this letter proves very well. ,

In closingl think that the lack of couches on porches will certainly solve this problem once and for all. After
all, the only way that students would be able to light a couch on ﬁre now would be to take one from inside their
house, and there’s no way they’re clever enough to do that. I mean, that doesn’t even make sense. Honestly. ‘

Graduation rates for Pitt’s mi-
nority students are almost 20 per-
cent lower than those for white
students. But Pitt isn’t the only
school inithe state experiencing
this trend, which experts say trac-
es back to grade school.

Information compiled by
the state Department of Higher

Education indicates that in 2007, .

the graduation rate, which mea-

- sures the proportion of students

who graduate within six years: for
black students attending Pitt and
its satellite campuses was 43.8
percent, while Pitt’s non-minority
graduation rate was 62.3 percent.

Marilyn Barnett, an education-
al consultant and chairperson of
the education committee for the
NAACP of Pittsburgh, said that
the disparity of graduation rates
stems from problems in educa-
tion beginning at the kindergar-
ten level. ‘ ,

Contest Winners bring ideas to life

by Amy Roberts
For T/9e Pitt Newa

Nine Pitt students are trying to turn
their big ideas into big bucks.

The students competed with about 100
of their peers to create the best new prod~
ucts or business ideas. The winners of the
Big Idea Networking and Awards Event,
which was hosted by the Institute for En-
trepreneurial Excellence last month, won
cash prizes and business contacts.

But in some ways, the contest’s not -

quite over. Several of the Big Idea ﬁnalists
—— who competed in the categories New
Service Idea, New Product Idea, Business
Growth Idea and Wild Card Winner .—
continue to work on their projects.

Megan Burka, a student in the Katz
Graduate School of Business, took sec-
ond place in the New Service Idea cate-
gory with her company, Nostalgic Picnics.
The service rents out customizable picnic
basketspfor lunches in Schenley Park and
Schenley Plaza.

\X/hile Burka’s company focuses on
Oakland, other contests’ services spanned
a broader area.

the competition, he said, is worth it_ because
it gets to see its ideas come to fruition.
Schevets said this year has been “a chal-
lenge beyond all standards and basically a lo-
gistical nightmare to organize the tearn.”/The

workshop moved from Benedum Hall to a .

facility in Harmarville.

SAE member \X/ill Lauer added, “The 25-
minute round trip [to the workshop] doesn’t
sound like a lot until you realize that we do
it five to six times a week. It’s costing team
members who are driving a lot in gas money,

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

and we are losing a lot of man-hours orga-
nizing carpools and commuting.”

There are advantages to using the work-
shop in Harmarville, though, said Schevets,
because it’s a technical facility, which means
the machinery they need to build the car is
easy to access.

Also, it forces the team to be organized
and set _specif1c meeting times, said team
member Mike Zimmerman.

That’s not the only ‘challenge the team
faces this year. ‘

“We had a lot of seniors graduate last
year, which made this year even harder,” said
Schevets. “Also, there wasn’t a senior this

year ready to take the position as president, ‘

so I stepped up as a junior.”
The team relies on incoming freshmen

each year to continue progressing, he said. If ‘

we don’t have freshmen coming in to learn

'how’Formula SAE works, the team won’t

continue to function. »

. Lauer.

Luckily, he said, “we have a few clutch
freshmen who have stuck. around through
the inconvenience of the relocation of the
shop, and they have become‘ a real asset to
the team.”

Schevets said he is constantly. teaching
next year’s potential leaders as he works.

“It’s important to tell the guys who may" ’

step up for next year exactly what I’m do-
ing and why I’m making changes,” he said.
“That way, the}? ll have a much better idea of
what they’re doing next year.”

But for now, the group’s sights are set on
the competition in Detroit this May.

“It’s crunch time,” said Schevets.

Last year, the team came in 32nd place
out of 120 teams. If the _team hadn’t lost
points for fuel economy, Schevets said, they
would have come in 17th.

“In the past few years, we just haven’t
been able to get it together,” he said, “but I
think this year will be better.

“And just in case I forgot to emphasize,”

T he added, “all the work we do on the car,

all the hell we go through, becomes totally
worth it when we get to drive the car. It’s a
feeling like no other, and you inevitably get
out with a huge smile on your face.”

to help diagnose AIDS.

“The problem with it is that the cheap-

range of $40,000 to $50,000,” said Dick-
erson. “Underdeveloped countries that are
afflicted by AIDS really can’t afford to have
one, so people in those types of countries
can’t even get a diagnosis.”

Eagle six-packs

bieneﬁtbeer buyers

Sometimes we students are spoiled
by convenience In Oakland we have
the choice to pick up six-packs of beer .
at a variety of snoresaround campus
or to take'a short walk to any one of
a number of nearby beer distributors
and buy a case. But for many people,

i the prospect of buying a six-pack

means adding another stop to their

This new initiative is objection-

First, Obama’s actions amount

to the effective nationalization of

Second, by refusing to allow the

antees that the decline of U.S. auto
manufacturers will be longer, more
painful and far more costly than if
they had simply been allowed to en—_

It’s important to remember that

Snuggies a strange joke from the Internet generation.

     

by Richard Brown

Oinnio/M Editor

 

I’m afraid I don’t get the Snug-
gie.

In case you don’t know what ‘

I’m talking about, I’ll explain. A
Snuggie is a blanket with sleeves.

, That’s it, actually. That’s all you ‘

need to know about Snuggies.
W/ell, sort of. Because, the weird

_ thing about Snuggies isn’t so much

that they’re a ridiculously silly prod-
uct, but that, somehow, without
any rational explanation, they are
popular. I ~
Last-week-I was watching “Late
Night \Y/ith Jimmy Fallon” ——I like
The Roots, don’t judge me —— and
Fallon did a segment with the audi-

ence called “Shared Experiences”-

where they would all do something
ridiculous together, and one of the
things they did was all wear Snug-
gies. Even Tracy Morgan came out
and did his interview in a Snuggie.
This, in itself, is not that strange.
Late—night talk show hosts do stu-
pid things all the time, like David
Letterman reading off the same

freaking top-10 list every night or
Jay Leno thinking that he’s funny.
But what I wasn’t prepared for
was for this to become some sort
of ‘actual trend. I read a column in

The New York Times where a guy .

went around the city wearing one,
and soon after other newspapers
began printing similar pieces. And
while I was writing this column,
I found a story about a 200—plus—
person Snuggie pub crawl in San
Francisco..
Let me repeat that, just for good
measure. More than 200 people
I -went out and wandered around San
» Francisco in blankets. Widt sleeves.

A good bit of the Snuggie’s ap— -

peal can be chalked up to its almost
sublimely ridiculous advertising
campaign, which features a variety
of people struggling with the fact
that their plain old blanket doesn’t
let them iuse their arms and that
.this is the most exasperating 

ever. Because, you know, 

your arm out from under a blanket
‘is a problem that has been on the
minds of Americans for decades.
The commercial also shows
people happily engaged in us-
ing their Snuggies, wearing them

while talking on the phone, hold-
ing a baby or roasting marshmal-
lows — things that are obviously
impossible to do while wearing a
regular blanket, or maybe a sweater
or something. i '
But somehow, this product
— which is, in pretty much every
respect, almost unbelievably stu-
pid —— became ‘a huge.‘ fad. Sud-

denly news networks are covering

it, celebrities are wearing them for '

publicity stunts and the company
that sells Snuggies,iAllstar Products
Group of Hawthorne, N.Y., has so
far sold more than 4 million of the
sleeved blankets.

Normally_I’m the sort of guy
who is more than happy to just
chalk this sort‘ of  up to
people being easily led into stupid

fads —— does anyone recall the pet ’

rock? —— and call it a day. But I

feel like there’s a slightly different‘

sort of mechanic operating here.
People aren’t wearing Snuggies

because they think they’re cool, be-
. cause it’s immediately obvious that
' they aren’t. They’re blankets with

sleeves, for God’s sake. They make
choir robes look fashionable.
No,'what’s going on here is that

the people buying Snuggies are
engaging in some sort of amaz-

ing parody act by actually living

out ‘the absurd imagery from the

Snuggie infomercial. And what’s
incredible about this is that it’s
unconscious: Nobody is watch-
ing the Snuggie commercial 
saying, “Hey, that looks like a use-
ful and innovative product that I
could really use to slash my heat-
ing bills and keep warm at sport-
ing events!” What they’re saying
is, “My God, that is the silliest
thing ever. This product deserves
nothing but ridicule and scorn.” ,,
The only  is, the way our

generation tends to ridicule
is by popularizing them to the point
where they’re indistinguishable
from a real fad. Look at Rickrolling
as an example. “Never Gonna Give
You Up” is, by all accounts, a ter-
rible songwith an even worse mu-
sic video. But dubiously redirecting
people to it on YouTube became
the height of Internet comedy,
and then the mainstream media
just turned the whole  into
one big fracas, and somehow in
the middle of that, the song actu-

o

it on the radio a few months ago‘

(and instantly thought that anyone
listeningto that station had been
Rickrolled, which I guess shows
how cool I am). '
Examples of this abound. The
ShamWow guy, lolcats, All Your
Base —— these are all memes that
somehow became‘ appropriated
by popular culture and took on a
life of their own. The only  is
that the Snuggie is an actual com-
mercial venture, and to make fun

of it properly you actually have to -

wear it, apparently in a pub crawl
with. hundreds of other similarly

minded enthusiasts.

So, what to make of the Snug-
gie? Undoubtedly, its popularity
will burn out in a few months or
so, and then 4 million people will

be stuck with a stupid sleeved blan— ,

ket. —But at least we can rest assured
that the vast majority of those peo-
ple weren’t buying it because they
thought it was a good idea, but
rather to make  of it And if you
actually own a, Snuggie, thanks for
making it impossible to tell actual

' fads apart from elaborate and ‘silly

practical jokes.

failure. .

An essential aspect of the
problem is that the government is
acting to insulate individuals and
corporations from the "negative
consequences of their actions.

. ‘The government is coddling in:
dividuals who bought homes they
couldn’t afford at rates they didn’t
comprehend and keeping corpora-
tions aﬂoat that’s products are not

The government is keeping
auto workers employed —e work-
erswhose demands for more ben-
eﬁts and‘ higher wages'than similar
workers at competing companies
contributed to the downfall of the
U.S. automobile industry.

The government has no respon-
sibility to the careless, the useless

or the shortsighted. Rather, Obama
must turn away from’ such heavy-

handed intrusions into the US.‘

market foundations of this coun-
It must be recognized that the
United States is inextricably linked
to the existence of a free market.
But_Obama is demanding that the
American people abandon the free-

market system envisioned by the
founding fathers and sacriﬁce their
economic liberty for bread, circuses
and the U.S. auto industry.

But the very liberty at the root
of our economic system is not
worth sacriﬁcing for the continu-
ation of failed businesses and the
jobs attached to them.

John Adams wrote, “Remember
democracy never lasts long. It soon

wastes, exhausts and murders itself.
There never was a democracy yet
that did not commit suicide.”
Only we, the citizens of this
nation, can destroy our democracy.

- Let us reject the statist economic

model that led so many nations to
ﬁnancial and political ruin before
we do any more damage to the
country. _

Bellfield Hall Auditorium
Student lickets $5

This weekend, Pitt’s Gamelan
Ensemble is asking Pitt students
to think outside the boombox
and expenence what percussion
instruments from the other side

of the globe have to offer. ' .

“The music is quite different
from the stuff we’re used to hear-
ing here on the Western side of
the world, so it’s rather. refresh-
ing,” said long-time gamelan mu-
sician and ensemble member Val-
ery Pinchuk. _

i “The goal is to expose players
and audiences to a musical style
that’s mostly neglected in main-
stream America. For example, my
spell‘ check thinks gamelan isn’t

even a wor ,” said musician Rob
Sheaff. _i

Gamelan music originates
from the island of Java in Indo-
nesia, located above the Western
side of Australia, according to
the Pitt music deipartment’s-Web
site. This musical style is created
byza group of instruments called
a gamelan, which is made up of
metal-keyed instruments and
tuned gongs.

The music is played in its native

land as accompaniment to theatri-
cal shows, dance, puppet shows,
martial arts and in concerts, and it
is often played to distinguish im-
portant life events.

Each instrument in a particu-
lar gamela/n is tuned speciﬁcally
to each of the others, making it
nearly impossible to interchange
instruments between gamelans.

“It’s interesting to think about
how different this style is from
the classical European musical

culture,” said Pinchuk. “While
players might come and go, the

gamelan will, hopefully, always

stay together.”

The Gamelan Ensemble is
actually a class, worth one credit,
that any student can take, accord-
ing to TA Benjamin Pachter, who
started with the group last spring.
It is taught by ethnomusicologist
Andrew Weintraub and Indone-
sian graduate student, Indra Rid-
wan.

The Machine keeps the Wheels turning for Pink  

by Alex Avakian
Staﬁ’ Wrtter

From “Absolutely Curtains” to
“Your Possible Pasts,” Pink Floyd

cover band The Machine can play-

you a Floyd song for almost every
letter of the alphabet in order.
And that’s just what it does.

It’s just one of the many differ-
ent kinds of shows that the band
puts on for audiences around the
world. ‘

M If it’s not A-‘Y, it’s recreating en-
tire albums or playing with a sym-

phony, and if it’s not those, it could
be  ~

“We try and recreate that whole
Pink Floyd experience,” said Joe
Pascarell, lead guitarist‘ and co-
founder of the band ‘

The original Pink Floyd had a
whopping 16-album repertoire,
which has given The Machine a
rather deep bag of tricks to reach
into at any given time. ‘

But beyond the music, The Ma-
chine tries to recreate the true Pink
Floyd experience, which is what is

generating positive reviews and has
fans coming back over and over‘
again.

For example, in its recently re-
leased TIJeMac}Jz'r2e Perform‘ Pink Flgrd
Live in Amsterdam, a massive screen
is displayed behind the band, with
imagery of spinning planets and
p's_ychedelic textures surrounded‘ by
bright blue, swirling borders that
change colors. There are also lasers
throughout the performance, as
well as fog rolling from the stage.

“We try to incorporate all of

that into our shows and bring that
whole larger—than-life Pink Floyd
experience into a smaller venue
where it’s more intimate. We try and
bring that texture and that mood to
the music,” said Pascarell. A
And while many cover bands
simply “cover,” The Machine is not

shy about letting its own musical.

ability and creativity shine through.
While staying within the means of
the original song, the band will of-
ten create its own solos,

different ways each night.

“The reason to do that is it re-
ally keeps us looking forward to
playing the music. It’s a lot more
ftm when there is some room there
that something might happen,” said
Pascarell. _

And that’s alsojwhat Pink Floyd
was like ——very improvisational.

“We’ve been playing ‘the music
for so long that I think we’re able to
improvise a little bit,_ and it happens

‘ in a way that feels respectful to the
original intent of the music. There V

Honda takes technology

one step closer with Asimo

by Donald campbell if

Colgmmldt

Honda is steadily developing
its Asimo robot into a smobth-
moving humanoid.

It looks similar to an astronaut
in that it appears to wear a space-
suit. Behind its visor are various

pieces of equipment for visual-

izing the world around it, and it

is capable of -climbing stairs while

staying bipedal. ‘

is some continuity. It’s not a forced thing, like,
these guys are now doing what they want to
do. It’s a natural extension of the music. The
idea is that you almost don’t notice that it’s
happening. And that’s what they used to do.”

“And I think it keeps the audience inter-
ested, t'oo.i°I think that’s one of the reasons
we have fans that have seen us a hundred

times.” ‘ -

. Over the years, The Machine performed
in Berlin, South Korea andjerusalem, and has
performed with the Philadelphia Symphony
Orchestra and built up a very solid fan base.

“When we first toured-internationally ﬁn
Jerusalem], the first time we got out of the
plane there were press people there wanting
to talk to us,” said drummer and co—founder
Todd Cohen. “We hadn’t experienced. that
before. Groupies plus the press, the enthusi—
asm was kind of startling.” .

The Machine formed in 1988, when long-
time friends Pas_carell and Cohen formed a
newfband based exclusively on the premise

of_ “playing songs they liked,” in‘Rockland
County, N._Y., 10 miles north of Manhattan.
As a kid, Pascarell describes himself as
someone who “devoured” new music. It was
his older brother who took him to see Pink
Floyd when he was 13. A huge Beatles fan,
Pink Floyd’s inﬂuence was quickly oVershad—
owed John Lennon’s. ' .
“It’s hard to imagine hearing that [Floyd]
in context of what the current music sound-

‘ ed like. I had never heard anything, 

like it,” said Pascarell. ’ _ -
While the band never met the real Pink
Floyd, it says that its idols are aware of them.

Norbert Satchell, a saxophonist who played

with Roger Waters and now plays with The
Machine, told Pascarell that Waters asked,
“Why would anyone want to play our mu-
sic?” .

But that doesn’t discourage TheMachine
at all. . A P .

“That sounds like something Roger Wa-
ters would say,” said Pascarell with a chuckle.

The class strives to instill in
students values of the Sunda-
nese. Sheaff stressed his en‘-
ioyment of the “friendly group
setting”_provided to him by the
ensemble. “No one player is, par-
ticularly important. Contributions

are equally valuable from every-’

one, which is always much more
fun,” he said. . .

\While ‘some members of the
ensemble particularly enjoy the
atmosphere of community, oth-
ers simply see it as a welcome re‘-
prieve from a busy day.

“You come from biochemistry

_or logic class, and you want to do

something ‘that doesn’t require
a lot of thinking_ and is medita-
tive,” said Hellmann. “Playing
gamelan is something that feels
natural, just using the instruments
to make something euphonic.”

The ensemble’s gamelan came '

to Pitt fromlndonesia in 1995,
according to the department
Web site and is named Kyai Tirta

Gold.” This set is actually ’made

is tuned differently. In sum, the
group typically plays 10 to 15 in-
struments, according to Hellmarm.
“Each instrument
something unique and wonderful
to the group’s overall sound,” said
Pinchuk.
Pinchuk described her experi-
ence  the group as positive.
“I’ve come to practice iri_a ter-
rible mood and left feeling like a
completely different person. The
music is like magic, capable of
giving the listener a sort of spiri-
tual scrub—down,” she said.
The upcoming performance

 not only feature the transfor-

mative music of Indonesia, but
some of its most famous faces
will be present, as .well. ‘

The show is part of an ‘an-
nual event called the University.

Artists-in-Residence Program,’
according to \X/eintraub, who cre-
ated the program in 2002..

“It’s important for students

Each year, musicians and per-

ed to participate in'various events
including lectures, workshops and
concerts. _ i « I

This year, Wahyu Roche, a vir-. -

tuoso percussionist, and Ening

The performances will be-
gin at 8 p.m. on both Friday and

dents. ' .

“I think it’s really fortunate that

Staﬂ’ Writer

There’s a certain excitement
felt walking onto a- basketball
court, looking up and around,
seeing monochromatic mobs of
people united under one team
and two colors.

That initial feeling is one thing,
but the atmosphere swells at tip-
off. The sights become sounds,
synchronized chants and screams,
audible gasps and the beat of the
crowd inhaling and exhaling in
harmony with players’ steps.

Coaches can give pep talks.
Music can energize an athlete.
Teammates can huddle and yell
and dance. But it’s the energy
of the crowd that keeps going
through the entirety of a game.

And then there’s' the feeling of
being the away team."

, Why everjyone shoul

by Evan Burgos
Staff Writer

I thought I had it all ﬁgured,

out. I made the picks I was sup-
posed to make. I rode the hottest
teams. I made _a Final Four pick
that, if it played out, was going
to land ﬁfe all that glorious cash.
.I was about to be at Blush for stu-
dent night, making it rain. .
And then, that oh—so—glorious
pick looked me square in the eye
and socked me in the face.
1 ‘ It’s an easy explanation: I’m
. an idiot. I picked Gonzaga to
knock off ' North Carolina. Now,
give me a' minute to justify myself.
. The Zags came intothe tourney
as one of the hottest teams in the
United States, riding as then—nine-
ganiie winning streak. The Tar
.- Heels seemed to be reeling from
a Ty Lawson foot injury, and no

show up in the Tournament. So

on_ Wednesday night, March 18, I
made that fatal change to my pre-

cious NCAA Tournament brack—-

et. I dropped Carolina from my

_ Final Four, had the Zags taking its

place. .

Talk about bad karma. Not
only did UNC romp Gonzaga by
more than I. know how to count,
but the rest of my picks came
crashing down -—i. from Memphis

to Louisville to  well, you know‘

who else lost this weekend.
And now, with my ultra-trendy

pick two games removed, the

Tournament all of a sudden-has
a familiar ring to it: Roy Williams,
Tom Izzo and ]im_Calhoun. All
three coaches have won National
Championships in the last decade.
All three expect to be one of the
last teams standing every year.»
Beyond coaching, though,
college hoops are a point guard’s
game. Often we encounter the
highly touted big man, the athletic
wing with all the NBA upside in

. the world. The Hasheem Thabieet.

The Dejuan Blair. _

' ‘ But time after t1'me,it’s the col-
lege point guards who have made
them look so appealing. Blake

There’s _simply no chance the '

Tar Heels would’ve arrived in the

Detroit section of your bracket, A

without Lawson. Had he been

sidelined, maybe my Zags pick‘

would have come through. But he
got better. And now,“ the Tourna—

ment is reduced beyond‘ all the'

Now, it is all about the eyeball

Softball

by Jasmine Hawkins ,
Staff W/riter

Freshman year of college can be overwhelm-
ing, especially if - you’re on the Pitt softball team.

“I wasn’t intimidated,” said ﬁeshman starter
Yvette Bravo. ‘ ‘I knew I would have to work hard
to prove that I’m not just another freshman and

i that I can compete with the upperdassmen.”
Bravo is one of 10 freshmen Panthers on the

20—player softball roster. Outnumbeming the two

' seniors and other upperclassmen on the team, A

the new additions were forced tostep up their
game if they planned on  a successful sea-
son. .
“Before we knew who was  to start, it
was understood that the freshman were goingto
have to step up early,” said third basemen Ciera

Damon. “The team lost a lot of seniors, and as _

freshmen, we were looking to {ill the roles quickly
and play at a  level” '
Under the direction of senior captains Sam
Card and Kaitlyn Schuster, the freshmen had
 trouble  on board
‘At any time there may be at least ﬁve fresh-

-men on the ﬁeld starting,” said Pitt coach Holly
Aprile. “The seniors actively helped it1 familiar-

izing our ﬁteshmen to demands on and off the
field. Our freshmen have meshed very well with
the rest of the team.” «

.According to Aprile, the freshmerfs skills

' have greatly contributed to the team’s success

“Our ﬁreshmen are pretty experien ” said

Apnle. “Theyhadgreattraveland summerteams, -

and they have helped out tremendously.”
Currently, the Panthers are only one win be-

hind last year’s record at this point in the season,

but the teamfs focus is not on game outcomes

“My biggest expectation is that we put forth

maximum effort,”-said Aptile. “I try to stay away
from game outcomes becauseif the players do
whatwe ask, those will work out”

Though the team has a record of 14-13 over-

  key experience early on

all and 2-4 in the Big Easi,Ap1ile says that it cori-

tinues to get better. .
“Our goal is to get 1 percent better every day

and not to go back or tread water,” said Aprile

“Welaskthern to give the full percentage of '

where they are- and we have consistent attitude
and effort” V
Wth the support of the  and coaching
staff; Apiile pushes the team to put forth maxi-
mum effort in practice, meetings and games
_ Although the team isn’t breaking records, the
freshmen contribution foreshadows a promising
and successful ﬁlture
“We’re doing pretty well,” said Bravo. “So far
we should have won more games, but we have a

' decent team and we’ll continue to improve as we

build more skill”
Freshman Kristen Cheesbrew said that her
most memorable quote from Apiile is, “I want

you to feel like you’re dying. and push yourself

take another step.” -. '

Cheesebrew said_that the quote is important
to the team because it exempliﬁes how everyone
plays. . . ' I t

After  Penn State last week and losing
to St: Johnh over the weekend, the team is look-
ing to bounce back and win more games.

“Though we are young, we have  expec-
tations for ourselves,” said Cheesebrew “Even
when we lose we are ﬁght in the game and not
completely blown away.” :

With a  portion of the season ahead, the B

team is looking to grow and improve. _
- “As time goes on, we’ll buildmore chemistry

. and we’ll  a good team,” said Bravo.

All of the Panthers have hopeful plans for
what’s ahead, and the freshmen are looking to
contribute anyway they can.

"Ihe first time I put on my I knew I

‘was a part of something great,” said Damon. “I

knew we were a special group, and we work well
as a team. I can’t wait to see how the rest of the
season works out.”

hotspot, made her first 3-pointer, the crowd
went nuts. When she made her second’,
third and fourth, they went ballistic. Fans

and media alike were stunned at Hand’s‘

ability to- play, while in the Ford‘ Center.
Before beating Pitt, Hand scored a sea-

son-high 20 points -against Tennessee at the

Ford Center, taking over the team for Paris.

.Pitt’s defense was concentrated on Paris,

as was Tennessee’s, and it limited her to 10

points and nine rebounds. Hand scored a -

cism and skill alone. J
In front of a crowd of 
more than 10,000 at the '
Ford Center in Oklahoma
City on ‘Sunday, the Pitt

and W/hitney Hand’s mis-

ing by her expressions, she

The Panthers didn’t

‘ Pitt had to face more _

happen in the same arena, under what will
likely be the same circumstances for P_ur-
due. Though the game isn’t happening on
its official home court’ at the Lloyd Noble
Center in Norman, Okla., they’ll draw a

bigger crowd than if it had been.playing at

“home” in a push for the Final Four.
Imagine, if you can,‘ if men’s teams had
the home advantage going into the Final

‘ Four. If they played at the Pete, for the

men on Saturday or the women on Sunday,
would basketball season be over in Pitts-
burgh? «

A likely answer is no.

Volovetski swept the events at the Big

as outstanding male diver for the second
consecutive year in the conference.

victorious in the best game of the Tourna-

ment so far in knocking off Pitt this past
Saturday. That is going to give them a lot of
conﬁdence and Scotty Reynolds provides the
best Lawson—antidote we know of. But will

‘Tyler Hansborough and co. tolerate another

Final Four burnout, like last year against
Kansas? Lawson overcomes Reynolds. and
Carolina marches on. " _

So that leaves Connecticut and North
Carolina. Both have played well all year. Both

, have been No. 1 in the polls multiple times.

Both have coaches who have been there be-
fore. _
So let’s eyeball—test it. The Huskies ﬁnally

Dyson. It’s Stanley Robinson, who has been
playing up every since the Big East ‘tourna-
ment. A]. Price is going as well as Lawson
right now, scoring in b'unches,'and big men
Jeff Adrien and Thabeet have been service-
able, But riot great. They can be better.

The Heels have the aforementioned Law-
son, who is the Tournament MVP as of now.
They have the supreme will of I-Iansbor—
ough, who is -essentially living for a National
Championship, because he’ll be just another
Christian Laettner in the NBA —— marginal
at best. The Heels also have the best starting
five in the country. When Wayne Ellington
is the third guy you mention on your team,
watch out. He’s got unlimited range and
NBA-like isolation ability. They have front-
court size in -«Deon Thompson and more
shooting from Danny Green. All their studs
came back to school for one reason, to finish
what seemed to end so abruptly last year.

huh? _ . 2 ~

Volovetski provided leadership for Pitt’s
team. He has the attitude that he expects
to be good and translates it to the rest of
the team. 8

“Alex has been a wonderful leader by
example,” said Krug. “He trains as hard
or harder than anyone else. He is not a
