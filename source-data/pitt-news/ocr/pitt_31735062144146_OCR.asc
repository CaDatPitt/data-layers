Do you go to school“? Ce-rtai11l.y, you answer, we all do.
But, the question is, “ls. ‘going to school.’ cnoilgli?” Pitt stu-
dents arc pi-one Ito complain about the lack of school spirit, lack
of conunnnitv spirit, and other things which they number
aniong the University sh0rt~c01nings.

Getting down to the basic cause of why our school is the:
way it is, one undeniable fact stands out in sharp proﬁle. This
fact is that too many people just “go to school” and too few
people really become a working‘, interested part of campus life.-

in itself does not constitute a magic key t_o the successful_.:liVing‘

the individual how to live and how to get along with other poo-I
ple. Therefore, studies and activities must be incorporated ii:'~
the student expects to obtain maximuin value from his four.
years in college.

The paradox which exists in 1'eg'ai'cl to student point of
view on studies as opposed to student point. of view on activities
is hard to understand. Students are more than willing to pay-
what is often hard-earned cash for the privilege of taking
courses and acquiring academic learning, yet they turn thumbs-
down on a change to acquire acttual “learning in living” which
may be had free for the taking.

' Studies require the expenditure of time and money. Activ-
ities cost tlieiiidiviclual only whatever time he is willing to de-
vote to them‘: In addition many5 activities offer the student def-
inite practice and experience in the ﬁeld he happens to be in-
terested in. An example of this are the student publications
which offer individuals interested in either wriiting or inanaging
an exceetliiigly fruitful opportunity to gain first hand experi-
ence in those "fields wherein their major subject is located. Don..’t
Pitt students realize that e"Xperi,ence a.nd achievements recorded
in activities which are (l.ircctl.y in line with their major ﬁelds.
give them a deﬁnite advantage when applying for a position
after gI'3.(_lll£ltlOl1? ,

To returnto that much mulled-over subject of school spirit,
we have never yet heard of anyone acquiring school spirit mere-
ly by mecl1zn1ic:i.ll_v attcncling classes day after day while remain-
ing void of any other contacts witth the University. Pitt will
never have true school spirit until a niajority of its students are
willing to “stick around awhile” and get to know and appre-
ciate their colleagues and their»facult.y through the medium of
activities. They must be where‘ t.l'1e_v can actua.ll_v experience the
pulse of collt-g'e life in order to put lll(-.‘lllSt“:l.\"("S in tune with it.

Local No. 7 of the Mid. Day
Chowder, and Marching society has
put its collective foot down.
“Something must be done about
the Tuck shop food and prices,”
sez Local No. 7. Since this mem-
ber is so delinquent in dues, as in
other ways, and being most likely
to be thrown out into Forbes
street, it was decided that this
column should register a protest.
Okay, so we protest. Our com-

’ plaint might be more aptly de-

scribed the Mystery of the Wan
Meat ball.

After being booby trapped into
paying 40 cents for a sandwich,
even though turkey and good, our
reluctance to expose disappeared.
Anger replaced timidity. We were
a crusader. Not that we don’t know
and love the Tuck shop and all it
stands for but now our money
and stomach was at stake. Investi-

gation proved that it was possible
to unwittingly spend $1.05 for 
sandwich, salad, dessert, and drink
snack which is all right at the

mobile as a gift but a little in-

congruous ‘with the atmosphere

that’s only because we’re such a

the Engineering Dept. has a hand
somewhere. ’

Never before in the history of
man have so many paid so much
for so little. Such prices are bound
to have an effect on the veteran’:
existence. Since the married vet
budgets his money and allots a
deﬁnite arnount to he and his wife
for ale, such abnormal expendi-
tures are very likely to effect his
wife's said allotment. All of which
contributes little to happy mar-
riage. Is the Tuck shop igoiiig to

Yea, we’ve heard of the Army

but we’ve also been in the Army

faintly resembles what we remem-

Letter to the Editor

The Editorand
Ted Humlnski
Dear Miss‘ and Sir,
It is to be hoped for the sake

of Ted Hi.-iminski‘s soul that “he
displayed mere ignorance rather
than a cunning distortion ofihis
story in -his curiously titled ar-
ticle, “U. S. Reveals Foresight in
Spanish Policy”. That anyone
could so glibly smooth over the
blackhearted cruelties of “friend”
Francois career almost nonplusses
us. (You see, we are followers of
those great Communist leaders,
Maxwell vAnderson and Ernest
Hemingway; being semi-literate.
and, perhaps, well informed, it is",
un.derstaridable that we should use
the ad.;i__ective “blackhearted” to
describe Franco. More desicriptive
words, of course, would be" con-’
sidered ,.obscene.) 
Mr. Huminski says, “A11yone

' who k,nQ_.ws the background of the

Civi~l'War, and has any realiza-
tion . . of the devastation caus-
. ” He seems’
to think” that the devastation was

, a force entirely independent for
. Franpo. Actually, as we all know,
~ Franco was the sole cause of what,-

ever devastation was suffered, by
Spain." Nevertheless, he goes on to
argue that Franco is to be =credited
with 1‘esto1*ing order after the waif!
Thus we find that a traitor to his
country incites a revolution, _em-
ploys mercenaries and foreign
troops, nearly devastates the na-
tion in the process of subduingh,‘
and then is given credit for ending
tions! , .‘

Secondly, Franco's protagonist
remarks, “By refusing to block the
Mediterranean, or to check our
landing troops in North Africa,
Franco aided the allied cause im-
mensely.” Exquisite logic! Franco
declines to stab us in the back and
he is a hero; he “aids our cause
immensely” by not attacking the
ﬂank of our army! This type of aid
is so negative and the type of
thinking that -construes it as “aid”
so outrageously twisted that we
are unable to expres sour exas-
peration. ‘

Mr. Huminski spattered his ar-
ticle with those demon words
“Communist” and “Russia”.

The ‘Spanish Civil War was lit-
tle more than an invasion of ‘Spain
by'Germany, Italy and Moorish
mercenaries. Franco received only
a fraction of his support from "the
people of Spain. Today, nine years
after the end of the Civil War,
thousands of members of the Loy-
alist army, all Spaniards, are -in
Franco’s prisons. Threats of revolt
fill the air and are stilled only “by
a large standing and fully mobiliz-
ed army. During the war moa-
sands of anti-Franco Spaniards es-
caped into France and joined the
Maquis in it.s noble ﬁght against
the ‘Germans. Franco renderedour
cause immense aid by recruitirig
men to ﬁght for the Germans
against Russia on the lEas'tern
Front.  

All of these facts have but one
conclusion: Punish our friends and
reward our enemies; support
Franco and forget about the suf-
ferings ot’ the Spanish people. And
why not? Did he not “air our
cause immensely?” . 

, Arthur Carlton ‘Hayes, the spir-
itual authority of Mr. Hurninski,
was an avowed Franco sympathiz-
er before becoming ambassador to
Spain. It was necessary to appease
Frappe -at that time because of
the”threa*ts of the press (govern-
ment controlled) that Spain would
sur‘r.~l.y go to war against the Unit-
ed. States. _
.A,_s a final offering to Mr. Hu-
1ﬁinSl$£S thought processes, how
does he explain that Hemingway
and Anderson have seen fit to glor-
ify the. ﬁght of Spain and its
friends against Franco? (Key
Largo and For Whom ~.the Bell
T'o_lls_). If they are communists.
Mr. Huminski would do well to
become a Communist himself.

THE PITT NEWS

Committee Recognizes
 Veterans Association

Through the newly organized
committee on recognition of stu-
dent organizations, the University
has granted probationary resog-
nition for a period of o.ne year
to the Veterans association and the
Pitt Flying club. '

As its name implies, the com-
mittee is empowered to grant of-
ficial recognition to new mixed
campus organizations, other than
fraternities. Under the chairman-
ship of Helen Pool Ru-sh, dean of
women, the committee is compos-
ed of the combined men and
women’s recognition committees.
Its policy is to consider the pur-
poseof, the campus need for, and
the potential success of proposed
organizations; and then to deter-
mine w.hether or not to grant pro-
bationary recognition to the group
as it has in the case of the Veter-
ans‘ association. ’

Two other groups have made
application to the committee for
initial recognition. They are: Pitt-
c'a_m, a photography group; and
the Morris Neaman Chapter of the
Zionist, Federation. -Collembol-ae,
biology organization which left the
campus a few years ago, has made
application for re-recognition.

‘During an organization’s proba-
tionary period the committee will
give the group assistance, encour-
agement, and guidance. By the
end of the probationary period, to
be eligible for continued recogni-
tion, an organization must have
delnonstrated its stability and abil-
ity to meet the_»stand«ards required
by the committee. An organization
‘failing to meet the standards 01‘
the committee "may have its stand-
ing reviewed by the committee at
any time. The committee has the
power to revoke its recognition of
an organization. The bases of ini-
tial recognition or continued ap-
proval of a student organization
are: ' i
. “l. The organization shall con-
tribute to the same general ends
for which the University exists. It
shall promote, the happiness and
welfare of itsfrnembers; show con-
sideration for the interests of non-
members; foster friendly relations
between students and members of
the faculty and administration;
stimulate critical thinking and de-
votion to studies; preserve the
freedom of the individual; encour-
age high social standards; culti-
vate god taste; —pr_ovid~e experience
in the application /of democratic
principles; give training in lead-
ership and eﬁicieiit management;
and in all these ways serve the
University and. create loyalty to
her. <99 I

Former Atlilete
Hopes To Assist
Chetnik Leader

Testimony of a former Pitt foot-
ball player may aid General Draja
Mihailovich, awaiting trial as a
Nazi collaborationist, in his ﬁght
for life.

Captain George Musulin, who
played for the University from
1935-37 and who was later a mem-
ber of the Pittsburgh Pirates, spent
more than nine months at Mihailo—
vich’s headquarters and _is con;
vinced of the innocence of the Yu-
goslav Chetnik leader.

“I would certainly like to testify
for General Mihailovich. His po-
sition today is a direct result of
itissiaii pressure and ‘partisan
propaganda. I "
f_eel~he is the
only figure in
the Balkans
who re p 1' e -
sents democ-
racy. He is the
only block to
Tito’s a m b i-
tions,” he said.

Fr 0 in Bel-
grade, the cap-
ital of Yugo-
slavia, came a
statement con-
c erning the
trial and a re- -5 r '
quest that the  :
Marshal Tito authority permit Am-
erican airmen to testify. Since
the US State and War depart-
ments have taken an interest in
the case, a meeting is being con-
ducted in Chicago to select a com-
mittee of witnesses, should Amer-

ican testimony be called for.

Just returned from service in
North Africa, Italy, Yugoslavia,
China, India. and Burma with the
Office of Strategic Service under
William “Wild Bill” Donovan,
Captain Musulin is eager to return
to Europe in defense of Mihai1o-
vich.

“The fact that Mihailovich
risked the lives of his own sol-
diers to save American airmen is
a shining example of his pro-Al-
lied sympathies,” he explained. “

The 31-year-old Johnstown of-
ficer, while awaiting discharge, is
contacting local airmen who were
with l\/Iikhailovich, in an eflortlto
collect evidence that may lead to
the release of the Chetnik leader.
' Musulin,.now living in Dormont,
was under contract with the Chi-
cago Cardinals when he entered
the service five years ago, but
hopes to settle down soon at some
local coaching or teaching position
in physical education.

The other day I wandered into
the Blue Tuck shop. Someone told
me the place was polluted with
neophytes and parasites so I ﬁg-
ured

that one little obscure ter-
mite more or less wouldn’t -be no-
ticed. As I w-allied by one booth.
SOTUB EU)’ in an orange-checked
coat and no tie sat there shred-
ding a cigarette into a half-ﬁlled
coke glass. He looked like he was:
about to offer me some so I am-
bled past. Chopped tobacco is al-
right with coke’ but I just can’t
stand it shredded.

I kept walking down the aisle
until some big guy, whose name
eludes me at this point, sto-od in
front of me blocking the aisle.
“Termy, old boy,” he said, “What-
ta ya doin’ here--Cuttin’ class.
eh?” “No,” I answered ﬁrmly, “I
don't have a class so I lh-Otlgfht I’d
come down and get a coke.” “Oh,”
his -face fell, “I thought ya wuz
gittin’ advenchoorus -fer once.”
Then he appendized, “Dey don’t.
have no coke anyway——sold» do
last an hour ago. Dey do have
some fountain Rem though. 'I‘ain’t
bad if ya git lotsa ice put in it.”

I turned around to leave him
and" noticed a tall girl with big
brown eyes who had just sidled
up to me “Termy, you cute little
square, you,” she shrieked demure-
ly. “Say, Pm glvin’ a party this
Saturday-——ah,”~——one of her harn-
like. hands was now clutching each
of my cheeks. Suddenly, I was
afraid, she ‘fl'lgl'll€‘!l‘Cd me. I think
she ‘was predatory or something.

 Lllom As  

Threat in Relays

By Al Roth
Shades of “Long John” Woodruff _and many other notable Pitt
track greats will take shape on Franklin Field in Philadelphia, April
26 and 27, when the Blue and Gold makes a belated return to the an-

nual Penn relays.

It has been at this event that a
great number of thinclad headlin-
ers ﬁrst emblazoned their names in
fame, inasmuch as the Quaker
City track carnival yearly acts as
an unofficial springboard to the
outdoor track campaign.

Pitt relay outﬁts have made an-
nual appearances at these festivi-
ties since 1932 and continued un-
ceasingly until 1942 when the war
began to inflict its toll on Pitt
track. __

The last Jungle Cat representa-
tion at this meet found the locals
copping the 440 relay title with
Hap Stickel, Bill Carter, Bob
Smith, and Al Peretic bearing the
honors.

In 1939, the Panthers virtually
walked oﬁ with the meet as they
became the very ﬁrst to capture
four relay titles in one afternoon
in all the seasons of Penn Relay
competition. On that day, the
Olsonmen trotted off with honors
in the 440, 880, sprint medley, and
one mile, relays. The 3:l4.8 still
stands squarely as a Penn Relay
relic. The sprint medley ‘effort
cracked a World record, since
erased, and now remains as an-
other meet record. The incom-
parable Woodruﬁ, Frank Ohl,
Clyde Graf, Allan McKee, and Al
Ferrara comprised that top-notch
Pittsburgh delegation. A

Among the many others who
have distinguished themselves at
the Penn relays while wearing the
colors of Skyscraper U. are Dick
Mason, Fred Kiger, Bill Keller,
Emmett McDonald, Charlie Groat,
and Harold Connolly, to name only
a few. All were members of suc-
cessful relay quartettes.

The Panthers are not without
their individual champions either.
Jim Elliot of Greensburg, and
Gene Taano, now a prominent
dentist, have garnered awards in
the javelin toss at Philadelphia.
Walter Good did likewise in the
hop, skip, and jump.

T weniy-one Report
F or Floor Drill

Monday marked the opening of
the 1946 spring basketball train-
ing for all those students who wish
to try their hand at the college
ﬂoor game.

Twenty-one candidates reported
to Dr. Carlson‘, basketball coach,
at the stadium. The doctor put

mentals é,f,l?§$3F5'_. -elib-all; .

The Doctor wishes ‘it "to be

else will go out to a:~'l\: anyone to
try for the team. It is purely vol-
untary.

Assisting Carlson for the coming
campaign will be Hank Zeller,
star for the Panthers at the center
spot for the past two seasons.

Anyone interested in participat-
ing in spring drills, should report
to the stadium gym at 4 o'clock

PiKA’s, Phi Delts
 For Cage Title

The IF basketball league came
to a ‘close this week with‘ the
PiKA’s and the Phi Delts defeating
the SAE’s. Neither of the games
was closely contested for the Phi
Delts and the PiKA’s were alto-
gether too powerful for the SAE
aggregation.

The results of the league have
the PiKA’s and the Phi Delts tied
for ﬁrst place with records of 8
wins against 1' defeat, and the
Phi Eps in third -with 7 wins and
2 losses. A playoff will be held on
Tuesday night to determine the
champion of the league.

Softball Inaugurated

Inaugurating the softball season
at Pitt, the Phi Eps defeated the
Phi Gams 7 to 2. The winners were
sparked by Jack Bloom whose
mighty bat accounted for 4 of the
7 runs. Bob Jones. lead the los-
ers with his al laround playing.

: A powerful SAE nine trounced
the Delts 19 to 6 on a muddy Trees
Field. The game was a one sided
contest all the way with Dave
Hughes leading the victors.

The PiKA’s defending cham-
pions opened their season with _a
10 to 2 victory over the Phi Delts.
John Gallager provided the mar-
gin of victory forthe PiKA’s as he
pounded out a homer and two dou-
bles. ' ’

hang up their ﬁrst win of the sea-
son. Coach Ralph Mitterling has
indicated Buck Johnson as his
probable starting hurler. John-
son, a righthander, is a big fellow
and owns a good fast ball. He'll
endeavor to throttle the bats of the
Salem hitters.

Ann: Trouble Plagues Yanchus

Until recently, Gene Yanchus
held the reins for the varsity
catching berth, but he has been
plagtled by a sore arm of late,
-which may sideline him for the
opener., In all probability his re-
placement will be Johnny Wasi-
”ecko, who was originally ticketed
to start at short. Wasiecko, a
good hitter, volunteered his serv-
ices behind the plate, and has
given impressive showings during
recent Panther workouts.

The starting inﬁeld is still fair-
ly indeﬁnite, but it could show
Clyde Marsiglio, a holdover from
last year, at ﬁrst base, Art Barnes

John Kuzio at the hot corner posi-

tion.

Barnes Covers Second and Short
A couple of other inﬁelders have

displayed good form during the

move into the starting line-up.

in which case Barnes would move
over to_short_._ Barnes, a. good hit-
ter and steady ﬁelder, is "a hust-
ling ball player, and can cover
either position.

Right ,»Field Position in Doubt

In the outﬁeld Coach Mitterling
may use speedy John Smodic, a
member of the football squad, in
left.

Johnny Connelly is slated to
cover the centerﬁeld garden. He’s
very fast, possesses a good throw-
ing arm, and can chase down ﬂy
balls with apparent ease. I,

Mitterling is still in doubt as to
who.will hold down the right ﬁeld
position. Dick Johns may get ‘the
call, or it could also be Gennock
in right. Sammy David, who
starred for the varsity basketball
squad, is ﬁgured to do a lot of
hurling for the Panthers, but
could be used in right when he’s
not on the mound.

The present Pitt. coaching staff is. being kept quite busy with
their coaching posts plus personal appearances in the Banquet Cir-
.cuit. Wes Fesler and Dr. Carlson are both doing their share in
spreading good will among high schools, athletic clubs and busi-
nessmen gatherings.

Wes’s theme th~roughout the circuit has been “Send your local
talent to Pitt in return they will receive free advertisement.” All in-
dications show that the Pitt coach is being warmly received but it
remains t.o be seedwhether or not his plea for home talent will be
answered. ' '

One thing can be said-——-Wes is doing a swell job in spreading the
goodwill for Pitt, which_ should have been in the process for the past
slit years, i C

Intramural Program ‘a, Success

The revival of; t:he.‘Pitt intramurals has given the majority of men
students an opportunity to participate in competitive athletics, The
program can be d:a_§e'med a success when one takes into consideration
the poor faeilitieslfitt offers. That trip up the hill is enough to dis-
courage anyone.‘ 4

_ Carl Olson and staff are now in the midst of the spring
1- intramurals  softball, track, swimming, golf, and tennis. The
. golf tourneys will give those students who wanted inter-collegi-
ate golf a chance to prove themselves. Mr. Olson deserves a
- feather in his hat for arranging with the City of Pittsburgh the
« use of the Sche§_ley golf course for the tournaments.

4 o’cli'::rl«:., OK‘? Right now I’m go-
ing to Ccmrnission.” And off Ruth
“Toby” Trhias hurried to attend
a vial. m.e«._~ting of discussions, re-
ports, gricrimces brought forth for
remedy, and most anything else
that might pertain to- the ‘welfare.
of women's activities on campus.
So that’s all Commission is?'_Just
discussions. reports, and gripes?
Not by a longshot. Commissionis
an — organization with. a two di-
mension_al fun-ction. Let’s take a
look at the dimensions, and meas-
ure them of importance». and vital-
ness.

Look at Commission atomically.
If we could draw -a structural
formula of women’s activities at
Pitt, we m:l<2'l‘it end up with a
single atom. Revolvin g «arou nd ‘the
nucleus of the atom you would see
the Various women's activities,
VVAA, twefhli floor project, YW
CA, Cwcns. and the rest. They
move rapidlv in their orbits, and
in order to keep them together,
each in thateir own orbit, so that
they will 1:’r:‘ve without friction or
-collisions-, there is the nucleus.
Commission  the nucleus. ,

“Toby,” vcc-president of.Com-
mission said, “The aim of Com-
mission is to unite all women's or-
ganizations under WSGA to func-
tion togetliei‘ in smooth coordin-a-
tion.” Every organization except‘
social fraternities, having at least
ten women. sends a representative
to the monthly meeting. ‘

Supposing there was on campus
a Women’s W at" Relief association.
Jane Jones, who was elected as
WSGA representative'» of WWR-‘
attends her first meeti-ng..

According to the usual proced-
ure, meeting comes to order, and
the minutes are read. At each’
meeting there are five reports giv-
en. Two, tllO-7é3‘- vi‘ the senior court

 

and the tr(~:" .. 2l‘."e. given at
every ineetfm". 'l‘i7".-.9 rs-rmaining 3%
pertain to :;..zir~ \":al discussion or

problem. whi--h mivht. arise in any
of the wor.nen":: activities. The fin-

ancial report given at each meet- ,

ing, informs the girls of the gen-
eral over-all ﬁnancial status of ac-
tivities. Perhaps money is needed
to start a “Hand-Me-Down Text-
book,” drive, or maybe the activi-

 

ization, and in this manner the
organizations get to know each
other.

When Pitt Players laid plans for
the production of Jim Dandy, a
representative of the Players came
to Commission and gave a report
of the plans, the time, place of
presentation, and nature of the
play. Support was asked, and each
WSG-A“ representative after mak-
?ng a note of the report, took the
information back to her organiza-
tion, and talked about it among
her friends. So did.Jane.

The locker situation, was dis-
russed, and the “representatives
spread the word around to share
lockers. They began looking for a
few more locker partners, too.

Another major issue of Com-
mission centers around the func-
tion of the Women's Employment
-council. The council offers advice
to Pitt women concerning the op-
portunities offered. them in the
various vocational fields. This ad--
vice is offered in the form of lec-
tures given by various people who
are authorities in their respective

vocational ﬁelds. The ﬁelds to be

lectured on are determined by
sturveys which the Employment
council has been making since the
fjcginning of the semester.

Now let’s look at the Commis-
sion from the perspective of what
itcan do to iron out. problems and
grievances. The
presented to Commissionthat the
nationality rooms and general

property of the University was be-

ing damaged by some of Pitt’s

students. Commission sent letters‘

to all the women of Pitt, asking
for their cooperation in

care» -of the property of their uni-
versity. _

Jane asks for the ﬂoor. and pre-
sents WWR’s' problem. WWR, be-
ing a young organization, has had
difficulty in arousing campus in-

ty purse is emptying too rapidly. ' 4

A warning to “go easier” is given.
Then reports’ of groups and com
mittees are asked for. '
Jane gives her report of WWR.
She explains to the girls the pur-
pose of her organization. She tells
Commission how the duties of her‘?
organization are carried out. She
lists the members, the oﬂicers, and
their plans for the comingyear.
Each representative takes this in-
formation -back to her own organ-

The sight of Easter bonnets and
spring suits reminds yours truly
that it’s about time to climb out
of his red ﬂannels, give a scratch
or two, and develop a good case
of spring fever. While I have
been scratching here and there, a
few reports have. come to me.
Here’s one from the SAE’s, who
report they have a ‘brand new
pledge, John Cully, by name. Also
they’ve welcomed Jack Little who
has just returned from the Navy.
Both boys were on hand for a
dessert dance with the Chi O’s last
Monday. V

I-lere’s a report from over PiKA
way. They had a big day Monday,
the ZTA’s were over for a tea

dance, then the boys went trotting

over to the. Kappa house for an-
other dance in the evening.
From the Phi Delts we hear the
TPA’s had a good time last Thurs-
day. Future plans consist of a big
affair with; Delta Gamma, their
sisters from Tech. They also tell
us, that they are afﬁliating. Had
Luce, a transfer from Allegheny.
The Delts took an elevator to the

Belleﬂeld A p a r t m en t s (they i

couldn’t get a street car) last Fri-
day and found themselves having
a swell time at the Phi Mu apart-
The Sigma. Chi’s are plan-
ning an alumni smoker for the
end of the month.

The Phi Eps are getting awfully
kind to their pledges. They have
two aﬁfairs planned, one at Ligon-
ier and a picnic at Frick Park.
Danny Howard, who is on leave,
was seen at the dance held by the
Phi Sigs.

All Spring Festival committee
heads, be sure to attend an im-
‘portant meeting tomorrow, at;
12:30 o’clock in room 139 C1.
Bring a plan of your activities
and a tentative ﬁnancial state-

ment.
