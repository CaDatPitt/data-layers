SGB drafts
proposal

for campus
safety plan

By Julie Sabol

News Assistant

The Student Government Board
is working to provide a safe
method of campus transportation
through a proposed Student
Security Service.

Board members have proposed
a walking-escort service which
would work much like the current
van system.

“We feel there is a need for
improved campus security, and
this is one of the ways we can

SGB member Jacob Brody, who
drafted the first proposal of the
program with SGB member
Daniel Leichter.

Students could call the service
and request escorts, who would
be trained in CPR, self-defense,
communications, rules and
responsibility. Both male and
female escorts would be present
for each mission.

The program was initiated after

UD plans aggressive campaign for presidential hopeful Harkin

By Heather Gahres
For T be Pitt News

The Health Education Office
director proposed a new program
to promote alcohol awareness
throughout the Greek system at
last night’s Inter-Fraternity
Council meeting.

The Greek Education
Assessment and Referral would
be similar to the residence halls’
Health Advocates.

“Greeks get a raw deal when it

comes to alcohol,” said health
education director Jeremiah

McAuliffe. '“It seems the powers
that be see the alcohol policy as
a legal issue rather than a health
issue."

The plan calls for each fraternity
and sorority to have a committee
of three to four members that
would receive training on alcohol-
related issues. .

GEAR representatives would
be supervised by McAuliffe and
starting in the fall would receive
three credits for being
representatives.

They would also form an IFC/
Panhellenic ' Association

committee. The plan requires
each pledge class to participate
in the five—hour Personal
Education, Assistance and Referral
program. PEAR is not specifically
targeted at Greeks.

GEAR would also allow
members of the fraternity to share
concerns about other brothers
having drinking problems‘ by
talking with the GEAR
representatives.

The representative would then

.work with McAuliffe to help the
person.

“I think it’s a fantastic idea,”

said IFC external vice president
Chris Block. I
“I think in the long run it can
really help out people that are in
need  I think it'll be a victory for

people who are alcoholics. It'll

give them someone they can talk
to who they're more comfortable
with.”

The program was the
brainstorm of the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity after it had to participate
in the PEAR program. The
proposal was tabled until the
next IFC meeting.

A new branch of the University
Democrats is in the early stages of planning
an aggressive campaign for Democratic
presidential candidate Sen. Tom Harkin of
Iowa.

At its meeting last night, group leader
Mike Cohen said, “We want to get the
movement going so that it will reach out
beyond Oakland. We’re students; we don’t
have a lot of money, but we can just give

of ourselves.”

Harkin announced plans for his
candidacy last September. He has been
instrumental in passing legislation which
favors the rights of the disabled, recently
chairing a Senate subcommittee to enact
civil-rights legislation for the disabled.

According to Cohen, “Harkin represents
what used to be the middle class. He is
very pro-union and is a proponent of
national health care and in making more
investments in higher education.” .

Joel Leonard, president of the University

Democrats, agreed that Harkin is an
excellent candidate.

“He is a strong Democratic voice with a
clear message about what America needs
to get back to: jobs, education and the
ability to compete internationally.”

Members of Students for Harkin
predicted that Pittsburgh would constitute
a strong area of support for Harkin.

According to Eric Thumma, “There
should be a strong following for Harkin in
Pittsburgh because this is a blue-collar
town. Pittsburgh generally votes

a

Democrat.”

Many group members said they feel
confident that they will be able to rally
more students and faculty members to
help them with their campaign, especially
by targeting campus organizations such as
the Black Action Society and the Campus
Women’s Organization.

Although Students for Harkin is working
in conjunction with the University
Democrats, people who wish to help out
with the Harkin campaign do not have to —
be UD members, Leonard said.

 

Student-athletes subject to special pressures

: H drugs to gain a competitive edge,
1 why male athletes often release
, their frustration through alcohol

 

 

um prrr NEWS, Wednesday, January 22, 1992 

 

All of us have strong needs to
be successful, to be recognized
and to be approved of by others.
College athletes have somewhat
of an advantage over most of us
in meeting those needs.

In our sports—oriented culture
athletes are center-stage people,
often idolized and envied by their
less athletically talented peers.

There is a potential downside
to playing competitive sports,
however, that often goes
unnoticed. The powerful
reinforcement that athletes get
for being so good at what they do
becomes addictive, and
addictions need to be fed.

The validation that comes from
the adoration of others can
become central to an athlete’s
feeling of self-esteem. He or she
may become so strongly identified
with the athletic activity that the
ever-present danger that it could
come to an ‘abrupt end is
extremely anxiety~producing.

For those of us who enjoy
sports as a hobby, a drop-off in
performance is a ' minor

aggravation. If our academic
performance slips somewhat, it
is usually not all that traumatic. A
“B” or “C” average may even be
viewed as something to be
pleased about.

If a college athlete’s
performance slips, however, and
begins to be comparable to a “C”
or even a “B” grade, a career may
be in jeopardy.

College athletics are
competitive in the extreme and

even a slight slip in performance ~

could result in a personally
embarrassing defeat by an
opponent, or even in the loss of
playing time to a highly
competitive teammate.

The work schedule of a college
athlete in season is also
unbelievably demanding, and
even the exceptional scholar-
athlete has difficulty maintaining
good grades.

If an athlete comes to college
with marginal academic skills
(probably because of an over-
focus on sports in high school),
the tasks of staying academically

Health Fair 1 992

 

Gallagher

eligible and athletically
competitive can be
overwhelming.

This enormous pressure,
accompanied by a fear of failure,
contributes to the high degree of
anxiety and the tendency toward
depression found in some
athletes.

It also partially explains why
some athletes feel the need to
turn to performance—enhancing

abuse and aggressive behavior,
and why so many female athletes
become susceptible to depression
and eating disorders.
Unfortunately, what makes this
worse is that both male and female
athletes have a need to project an
imagelof being strong, controlled
and un—needy, which makes it

‘difficult for them to seek
8 professional help or even to share

their anxieties with close friends.
Life is not all fame and glory for

T the college athlete.

There are many great moments,
of course, and even with all the
stresses many athletes look back
on these years with few
regrets.

For those of us who sit on the
athletic sidelines, either as awe-
struck fansor cynical critics, it
might be worthwhile to step back

/occasionally and take a look at
this complex mix of glory and
stress that defines, in part, the life
of a college athlete.

Interest in SAC increases

By Rebecca Baker
For The Pitt News

With a 100-percent increase in staff members seeking election
to the Staff Association Council and a newly acquired Senate
Council seat, the SAC is gaining recognition at the University of
Pittsburgh, according to SAC President Joanne Rosol.

Rosol said the increase in staff interested in SAC represents a
cross—section of staff positions from administrators to secretaries.

Karen Gamble, a member of SAC since last June, said she
joined the organization because it is “dedicated to employees
and concerned with the staff.”

Rosol credited this year’s increase in membership to the
leadership of Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor.

“O’Connor encourages the ideas and opinions of the staff by
creating joint decision—making.” she said.

“We’re involved in decisions. We just don’t have an advisory
position any more.”

This “decision making” involves input into Pitt’s budget
process.

“The staff can give the process a different perspective, but
we’re not discusing allocations for the SAC. Our input is for the
university as a whole,” Rosol said.

. SAC will influence the Senate Council as well.

“The bylaws of the Senate said that we should have always
had a seat, but we got lost in the shuffle,” said Rosol.

SAC chooses its members by an election process that maintains
equal representation for its five major employment areas:
Provost’s Office, Health Sciences, Business and Finance, Alumni
and Student Affairs.

According to Rosol, members become aware of university
policy and procedure through SAC and become involved in
projects.

One SAC member represents approximately 300 staff
members.

Blac/e organizations necessary, says NSBE

By Kirsta H. Bleyle
Staff Writer

Many students do not
understand the need for “black
organizations” such as the Black

Action Society and the National

Society for Black Engineers,
according to NSBE President
Bentley Ritter.l

“The majority of social,
academic and professional
institutions in this country are, by
their very nature, set up for the
advancement of white males,”
said Ritter, a senior majoring in
mechanical engineering.

“We don’t need a ‘White Action
Society’ because it’s here. The
reason thatwe need organizations
like BAS and NSBE is because,
contrary to popular belief, we
don’t live in a color-blind society.
There are specific minority
interests and needs that aren’t
being met by society at Iarge.”

Although Ritter said blacks and
minorities are better off in the

corporate world today than they-

were 20 years ago, he is a strong
supporter of affirmative-action
programs.

“Before the days of affirmative
action, blacks and other minorities
were blatantly discriminated

against in the work force,” Ritter

said.

“Without affirmative action,
blacks would not have been able
to make the strides that we have
thus far.” But unless attitudes
change, affirmative action
programs will not solve the
problem, he said. .

Ritter said society has to go
back and reverse the past effects
of discrimination and offer
opportunities which have
formerly been excluded from
certain people.

“If you’re running a race, and
before every race somebody
shoots you in the kneecap, of
course you’re at a disadvantage.
And then, if that individual
decides, ‘OK, I'm not going to

shoot you any more,’ is the race’

fair?”

According to Ritter, NSBE is
designed for blacks and other
minorities in engineering and
applied sciences to provide a

support base and encourage
recruitment, retention and
graduation of its members.

NSBE was started at Purdue
University in 1975, and there are
now more than 150 chapters
nationwide.

In the 19703 Pitt’s chapter was
called the Black Engineering
Council, and it became a chapter
of NSBE shortly thereafter. The
Pitt chapter has approximately
40 members.

NSBE works to extend its
influence to high school blacks
and minorities by interesting them
in engineering and applied
sciences.

The “pre-college initiative
program” started last term when
high school students from
Philadelphia came to Pitt to hear
NSBE speakers.

NSBE is also co-sponsoring a
series of minority jobs fairs and
seminars with BAS.

Pitt debate team works to improve rankings

 

By Dan Darragh
Staﬂ’ Writer

Members of the Pitt Debate
Team returned yesterday from
Salt Lake City, where they placed
in the semi-finals against 20 other
schools at the University of Utah.

Team member Anand Rao said
this year's national debate topic
focuses on overturning several
Supreme Court decisions
recognizing the right to privacy.

Rao and his teammate Stefan
Bauschard competed in eight
preliminary rounds at the Salt
Lake City tournament and were

then matched against other teams
with similar scores.

Debaters do not find out what
the opposing team's position is
until the tournament begins.

“The only way to know what
other teams may be arguing is by
spying — gathering information
about they have discussed
before," Madsen said.

Each team is given a time limit
for their speeches. A coach from
a neutral university serves as the
judge and decides which team
presents the most convincing
argument.

In addition to helping Pitt place

in the semi-final rounds, Rao
placed as ninth speaker.
Madsen said the team is
improving. “There’s a momentum
building; everybody’s getting
excited about the upcoming
national tournament in April.”

The debate team plans on
attending seven competitions this
semester. This year’s national
tournament will be held at Miami
University in Oxford, Ohio.

There are four members on the
debate team. Rao and Bauschard
form the top team, while Chris
Shellito and Mike Nelson form at

second team.

These two competed at George
Mason University this weekend.
Most of the members major in
philosophy, political science or
both. They said they’re going to
try their best not to grow up to be
lawyers.

“It’s true we have to do a lot of
studying on our topic, but it
crosses over into our schoolwork.
Last year, we had to research
America’s trade policy for Pacific-
rim countries. At the time, I was

Golden Key I907/tor

society celebrates
fourth year at Pitt

By Christine Harma
Staff Writer

Although this is the Pitt Golden
Key Honor Society chapter’s
fourth year in existence, the GKHS
Mid—Atlantic regional convention
will be held at Pitt this year.

“\X/e’ve come so far in just a
little time,” Jarvis said.

The requirements to gain
admittance to Golden Key are
junior or senior status and a 3.3
quality—point average.

According to GKHS President
James Jarvis, the 3.5 QPA
requirement is lower at Pitt than

at other universities because the
University of Pittsburgh is a “very
strong academic school” and
higher QPAs are more difficult to
obtain.

“I’m proud of our university for
that,” Jarvis said.

There is a $47 lifetime fee to‘ be
a member, but most collegiate-
level honor societies require an
entrance fee, Jarvis said.

The national GKHS offers
two $500 undergraduate
scholarships to each campus
chapter.

Nelson joked that he
joined because, “my mother

really neat to work together
with people who share your
interests.” .

All four members were
involved with their high
school debate teams. Pitt's
own team is currently small,
but it hopes to grow in the
future.

“We’re in the process of
recruiting,” Madsen
said,”I’ve found six
interested students who
have applied to Pitt. There
is limited financial support
available,
experience and need, for

Pitt Professor David Hercules is the first recipient
of the Miles Chair in chemistry, recently established
by Miles, Inc., and the Mobay Corporation.

Hercules came to Pitt in 1976 as a professor of
analytical chemistry and served as the chair of Pitt’s
chemistry department from 1980 to 1989.

Hercules holds a doctorate from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and has been the recipient
of several honors, including the American Chemical
Society Award in analytical chemistry in 1986 and

The Learning Skills workshops
recommend taking a 10-minute
break for every hour of reading,
reviewing notes 15 minutes before
and after class and sitting in the
front ofthe room during a lecture.

The workshops meet two hours
a week for four weeks to show
students how to approach
textbook reading, note taking,
time management and memory

strategies, according to Thomas .

Webster, a student academic
counselor at the learning Skills
Center. -

Courses are free, and there is a
special session for first-year
students.

These workshops have become
more necessary each year and
have helped many students
improve their study skills, said
Rosalynjones, the head counselor
at the LSC.

The workshops are kept at a
maximum of 15 students so that
each student can be given
individual attention.

A diagnostic test is given at the
beginning of the workshops so
the counselor sees what the class
should concentrate on and to
mark the improvement made by
the end of the session, she
said. I

“What is most effective about
the course is that it is taught by
students,” Webster said. “As
students we can relate to specific

problems faced by students.”

The counselors go through a
series of interviews and a semester
of extensive training.

The LSC also offers a speed-
reading workshop.

Extending the year

Time for a trip down memory lane 

Remember high school and the anticipation of summer
break? Counting down those 180 days until June was not
only a habit, it became a tradition by senior year.

Now that the realities of college surround us, we think
we had it easy then. But students in elementary, junior
high and high schools in Pennsylvania may not be so
lucky in the years to come.

The Task Force on Extending the School Year (a panel
made up of 12 Pennsylvania state representatives and six
senators) is on the warpath.

At a meeting at Taylor Allderdice High School last week,
the group expressed its concern about the disintegrat-

j ing motivation of students and claimed that a longer

school year would help to improve the intelligence of
children. ‘

True, the United States’ school year is one of the shortest
in the world (180 days) compared to Japan and Thailand
(243 and 200, respectively), but extending the year is not
a guarantee that students’ GPAs and intelligence will
improve. I .

Rep. Ivan Itkin, D-‘Squirrel Hill, told The Pittsburgh Press
that thejapanese attend school 240 days per year and that
their students outperform Americans in many areas,
particularly science and math.

The problem here lies not only with the students but
also with their educational facilities. Sending students to
low—quality schools with low—quality curricula and low-
quality facilities for an extended_period of time will not
affect them positively.

Itkin said that some educators support year-round
schooling -4- with breaks staggered throughout the year
—— because it gives students a sense of continuity in their
studies, according to the Press. _ ‘

Considerations overlcost are not the only drawbacks.
TFESY'appears to be ignoring one important factor in

_ their decisions: the students.

Among other problems, summertime may be the only
time for them to earn money to attend colleges and
universities. Unfortunately, as most college students
struggle with little or no money, they may be the only

‘ group to sympathize.

T FESY is determined, and it seems that other groups are
in support of their goals. “Pittsburgh teachers ratified a
contract last month that extends the school year by adding
three training days and changed the school day in high
schools from eight to nine periods,” according to the
Press. A

Obviously, if the “majority” are “in general” not living up
to the expected standards, the problem lies within the
educational system, not the school calender.

Public Enemy raising ‘Arizona’

The controversy raised over
Public Enemy’s video “By The
Time I Get To Arizona” is a
travesty. When P.E’s Apocalypse
9]  The Enemy Sm’/ees Blacle
was released, anyone who
listened to “Arizona” didn’t need
visual images to tell them what
the song was about. But, of course,
the uninformed critics waited until
the video came out. Now they all
jump on the “let’s bash P.E.”
bandwagon again. This video is a
fantasy that depicts the
assassination of Arizona officials
by P.E’s Security of the First World,
the S1W.

Critics have called the video
“hatefu1ly racist” and “pro-
vocatively violent.” Why is the
video racist? Because there are
blacks murdering whites? Did
anyone stop to think that the
politicians of Arizona are white
and the S1W’s assassination is of
Arizona politicians? If a white
group made a video depicting the
same assassination, would they
be labeled racists too? Using the
distorted logic of these idiots, I
guess so. ' » A

The video is no more violent
than countless other videos on
MTV. To call this video
“provocatively violent” is
absolutely laughable — not to
mention paranoid. P.E. fans are
some of the most educated music
fans anywhere, and they realize
this isn’t real. Chuck D knows
exactly what he’s doing; just
stirring up the masses a little.

“Non—violence in a violent
society can be used as a tactic but
not as a principle,” Chuck D said.
“This society was built on violence
and is still violent today. My art
creates dialogue. I make art to
create dialogue and put pressure
on people,” he said in an interview
with MTV’s Kurt Loder.

There are tons of movies with
massive violence, hundreds of
graphic shootings and lynchings,
but those are considered
“entertainment.” So it seems that
it’s all ﬁne and well for white men
to wheel big guns, but once a
black man does, look out. The
fact that the video depicts a white
legislator eating poison candy and

Rob
Pugliese

several other politicians being
blown up in a limousine by a
band of black men is not racist ——
it’s merely revengeful. With these
images Chuck is alerting
politicians that if action doesn't
happen soon, this scenario could
be acted out in the real world.
He’s raising consciousness, and
people who think this nation is so
civilized better wake up. The
footage from the civil rights
marchers of 1968 being attacked
isn’t forgotten. .

This is one more effort by the
media to persecute and tear down
everything that Chuck D and

. Public Enemy have been building

for five years. They won't be
satisfied until P.E. disbands, and
they continually try their
damndest to make it happen by
stirring‘ controversy over
everything the group does. Chuck
is hardcore to the bone and never
backs down from controversy. All
this will do is give P.E. more press
and make their message more
powerful, as well as increase
anticipation for their future work.
In reality, the group’s enemies are
helping P.E. gain more exposure.

“The proof is what P.E’s all
about,” Chuck said. “I’m an artist
to raise dialogue; to get the King
holiday in.” As strong as Chuck is,
it’s apparent that he does have a
paranoia involving the media, and
rightly so. “Media and perspective
is the important thing in the
1990s,” he said.

Arizona is the only state in the
union that does not have a King
holiday. The politicians of Arizona
should be the people under fire,
not Chuck D. There is no reason
why Arizona can’t have this
holiday. ’'

The politicians who suggested
that the state can’t afford another
holiday must really think we're
stupid. They prove how sad our
country is.

V Anybody who knows anything
about Public Enemy knows that

Chuck D is not a racist. Chuck has
done more than anyone in the rap

brotherhood between races.

After two come—from-behind
‘victories, the Pitt women’s
basketball team dug too big a
hole to make it back in last night's
70641053 to St. John’s.

“We have the kind of team that
can come back from behind to
win, but it’s not something you

i  want to rely on,” Pitt head coach
’ Kirk'Bruce said. “I think maybe

today we might have relied on
that a little bit.”

The Lady Panthers (7—9, 3-4 in
the Big, East) charged to an 8-0

. lead on inside scoring by Jonna

Huemrich and Carol Miller and
an outside jumper by Jill
Colabrese.

Pitt extended its lead on the
Express (10-6, 3-4) to as many as
nine, taking a 17—8 lead on a
layup by Huemrich with 12:45
left in the half. Then things began
to fall apart.

After a three-pointer by Express
guard Amy Bolen to make the
score 17-13, St. John's got four
straight short jumpers from six-

5 Kerry Hanley to pull within one.

Express led 41-31 at the half.

“We didn’t come out like you
would expect us to come out
after winning two on the road,”
Bruce said.

Even more killing were the
missed free throws in the first
half. Pitt made only three of 10
from the charity stripe, including
only one of six for Miller.

Miller did score eight points in
the first half, but could have had
more. ,

St. John's seemed about to pull
away early in the second half,
extending their lead to as many
_as 14, but Pitt hung around and
pulled back within nine on a
basket by first-year forward Julie
Fornadel with 13:10 left. The Lady

Panthers stayed that close most ’

of the way but couldn’t get much
closer.

“There were times when we
were trying to come back, when
we had some free throws we
could have made,” Bruce said,
“and I think that made a big
difference.”

A layup by forward Tina Ogden
gave the Express a 61-49 lead
with only 7:28 left, as Pitt finally
found its intensity on the
defensive end. St. John's scored
only one point, a free throw by

free throws were scored by Odom
with 2:16 left.

parents in an effort to squelch some of his
seemingly boundless energy. But what
began as just a way to keep Matt Brady
busy in the winter has kept opposing
swim coaches busy worrying about the
Pitt swim team. The addition of this first-
year student has made an already respected
swimming program even stronger.

Brady was recruited by Michigan,
Stanford, Florida and Florida State, all
universities with top notch swimming
programs. But, choosing Pitt was really
not that tough of a decision.

He swam with Team Pittsburgh Aquatic
Club under the supervision of Pitt men’s
swimming head coach Chuck Knoles and
coach Mark Davin. This positive
experience, along with Pitt’s ﬁne academic
reputation, gave Pitt a distinct advantage
in the recruiting wars.

“Coming from a private school [Shady
Side Academy], Pitt’s excellent academic
reputation was important to me,” Brady
said, “because I am not going to swim
forever so I need to make something of
my life.”

Although he may not swim forever, he
has swum competitively for most of his
life. Brady was an active, athletic child
who played baseball in the sufnmer and

hindsight.

“I always had too
much energy as a kid
and that is why my
parents put me in
swimming when I was
six,” he said. "I ended
up stumbling upon an
aquatic program at Penn
Hills High School so my
parents threw me in
there to keep me busy during the winter."

Brady played water polo and ran cross
country in high school, but they were
deﬁnitely secondary activities to swimming.
He even had to give up his summer
baseball.

But once he concentrated solely on
swimming, he learned the discipline it
takes to be a top athlete in the sport.

A typical day for him begins at 5:45 a.m.
with a long, cold walk up to Trees Pool
where he will swim until 7:30 a.m. Then
he goes to the weight room for an hour
and a half of lifting. After breakfast, Brady’s
schedule of classes will end at 2 p.m. —
just enough time for the trainer to loosen
up his shoulders for the 3 p.m. practice. At
6 p.m., it's back down cardiac hill for
dinner, and the rest of the day is his.

16 points.

Instead of a well
deserved night of
partying, he will use
much of his scant free
time to study. He
realizes that his
academic career is more
important than
anything else.

“I partied a lot in
high school,” he said.
“Now I figure I am in
college, and it is time to
worry about where I
am going with my life.”

So far, he is off
to a great start. In his first term at Pitt, he
earned a 3.9 QPA in his classes, which
included Russian and Business Calculus.

“Coming in here I needed to perform
well academically first and then
athletically,” Brady said. “It is something I
need to do for myself. If something has to
give, it is going to be swimming."

On occasion, Brady has had to make
that choice, and the reaction of his coaches
convinces him that coming to Pitt was the
right decision.

“A lot oftimes you will get coaches that
will preach about academics coming before
athletics, but when you get right down to
it, that is not the case. I have encountered
a few coaches like that in the past, but
Chuck and Mark are true to their word.”
Brady said. “They really mean it when

they say ‘Academics before Athletics.’

“If you need to skip a practice to study
for an exam, or you need to get out early
for a class, then that is what you need.
They understand that.”

It was also easy for the coaches to
understand that they had a genuine blue
chipper on their hands as Brady has
quickly become one of the top swimmers
on the team. At the Pitt Invitational in
December, he set school records in the 50-
and 200—yard backstroke, the 200 freestyle,
the 200 and 400 individual medley and
was part of the record breaking 800 free
relay team. _

Stereotypically, athletes of this caliber
have an arrogant reputation that precedes
them. And although Brady’s performances
warrant such behavior, it is not evident in
the pool.

“When I first saw him, people warned
me about him,” Davin said. “They said that
he wasn't really a team player, among
other things, but I don’t know where they
were coming from. He was always there
for us to help with the [Team Pittsburgh]
Aquatic Club and the younger kids.

“He is not afraid of hard work. He is a
true student of the sport, and I am very
glad that he is here.”

“He is an enigma,” Knoles said. “Like all
superior athletes, short of swimming fast,
you are never sure what you will get from
Matt. I enjoy that mystery. It is exciting

Though hampered by illness
and accidents, the Pitt women's

sophomore point guard is the
team leader in assists and steals,
but makes just 35 percent of his
shots. The rest of the team echoes
Brown’s stats, with the possible
exception of first-year guard Irvin
Church. The heir apparent to
Harrison’s spot, Church is the top
three—point threat and the only
guard shooting over 50 percent
from the floor.

Alongside Mourning are
sophomore Robert Churchwell
and first-year player Don Reid.
Churchwell is a good offensive
rebounder but has limited
shooting range. Reid is a 250-
pound" banger and his starting
assignment is somewhat token as
he usually plays about 11 minutes
acontest.

The bench is deeper than last
year but very inexperienced. Six
of the seven bench players are

gymnastic groupies could see
deﬁnite alterations in the Lady
Panthers’ lineup. In Pitt's first
event, vaulting, spectators saw
two familiar faces, Kristin Brown
and Karen Jorgensen, and four
new faces in the lineup.
Newcomers to the Lady Panthers’
vaulting squad were senior Tracy
Jung, who scored a 9.05, and
first-year students Heather
Halovanic (9.05), Mikie Myers
(9.30) and Alisha Friend (9.05).
Starting the vaulting lineup was
Kristin Brown who was not
practicing during the fall semester

either first- or second—year players,
and Thompson favors a rapid,
multiple substitution pattern. As
with his past teams, Thompson
has many players who can play
more than one position.
Defensively, the Hoyas are still a
high-intensity, pressure defense
with a tremendous shot—blocker

in ournin. eor eown re A
M g G t fo es

over 17 turnovers a game, but
their own offensive problems
have produced nearly the same
amount of turnovers.

To their credit, the Hoyas are
an excellent foul-shooting team,
and they get to the line often. As

due to a wrist injury. Brown came
back into the gym only a month
ago and has not been permitted
to practice several tricks because
her wrist is not yet strong enough
to execute them.

“For her [Brown] to compete
all-around in this meet is pretty
good,’.’ Yohman said, “but Kristin
has a long way to go to get back
to where she was last year.”

According to Yohman, Brown
has conditioned herself to the all-
around mentality very quickly. “I
feel good about my performance,”
Brown said, “but I should have

a team they are shooting over 68
percent overall and over 70
percent in Big East games. Both
Mourning and Brown convert
around 80 percent of their charity
tosses. But unless Mourning is in
the game, and active, the offense
is stagnant. i

Mourning’s production is
virtually the same for the
Georgetown wins and losses, so
it is the rest of the team that must
come through for the Hoyas to
win. Right now Church and
Brown are the only other players
who can create their own offense
successfully. If either one can,

in irwzmriorzozl

made my last tumbling pass. I 

feel like a real jerk about that, but
it’s just because I haven’t had

enough time to do many floo -

routines.” -

Brown’s last tumbling pass :
included a one-and-one-quarter »
ﬂip. She was unable to execute it ’

properly because she has not
been working with it during
practice. '-

Missing from the Lady Panthers’
vaulting lineup were Gina
Venezia and Jeannie Vecchio.

Aside from Mourning, the
Hoyas are a relatively small team.

can be nigh

 

 

 

This is one team that the Panther ,7 

backcou rt of Sean Miller andjerry
McCullough matches up with.

Considering the defensive-

piessure that Georgetown creates,
those two will probably see a lot
of time tonight.

Up front, the idea is to surround
Mourning with several players
and force the Hoyas to hit outside
shots. Pitt could use a zone
defense extensively against this
team, and it could work.

all-around competitors, did not
compete in the meet due to an
ankle injury she received two
weeks ago. She again crunched
her ankles by landing short on a
double back during vaulting
practice.

Yohman had Vecchio
scheduled to perform her uneven
parallel bars routine, but pulled
her from the event to give her
ankles a rest.

The Lady Panthers’ bars squad
experienced two falls during
release maneuvers. Bar scores
came from Brown (905), Friend
(9.00), Jen Butkovich (8.95),
Meyers (8.30) and Jorgensen
(8.15).

The balance beam was
scheduled as the Lady Panthers’
third event. The beam is normally
one of Pitt’s strongest events. Pitt
received a team beam score of
42.95. They also had seven falls
from the beam. Jorgensen, one
of Pitt's strongest beam
competitors, slipped off of the
beam and hit her knee. As

_  Q ‘ I . . - THE PI'I'l' NEWS, Wednesday, January 22, 1992

Jorgensen hit the beam, spectators
could see the amount of pain she
had experienced. She pulled
herself together and continued
her beam performance. Another
of Pitt's strong beam performers,
Meyers, also had some problems
on the beam because she was
unable to workout last term due
to illness.

“Its been a very slow start,”
Meyers said. “It can only get
better from here.

“It couldn't possibly get any
worse,” Meyers added.

' “Once everyone starts to get
healthy again,” Jorgensen said,
“and everyone who’s suppose to
be in the lineup gets back into the

‘ lineup, we can get back to normal.

“Its like we’re playing a waiting
game to get through a meet and
try to use our depth to our
advantage," Jorgensen added.

According to Yohman, her
beam lineup was down to the last
of her competitors that she could
put into the competition. “The
kids that were out there were
ready, but they weren't ready,”

Yohman said. “Its been a rough
week; at times when they felt
they were tired, you had to make
them keep going.”

Last weekend’s performance
was the first time that Venezia
was on the beam in over a week
due to a hand injury. This was
also Venezia’s first full-floor
routine as well.

Pitt’s final event was also one
of its strongest — the floor
exercise. In this event it is the
endurance of the athlete that helps
or hurts her performance.

Several members of the Pitt
floor squad had been sick or
injured in previous weeks,
therefore, their endurance levels
were low. Combined they scored
a 44.80.

“It was like everybody
contributed to the good things
that happened tonight,” Yohman
said, “and everybody contributed
equally to the mistakes we made.”

The Lady Panthers’ next
performance will be on the road
against the University of New
Hampshire on Jan. 26. The Lady
Panthers’ next home competition
will be on Feb. 1 at 1p.m. at Trees
Hall. They will be hosting a quad
meet with The University of

SKI REPORT IIOIIJNE:

I has swum fast enough in the 100

and 200 backstroke, the 200 free
and the 200 IM to compete in the
NCAA qualifying meet and is very
close to againvqualifying for the
Olympic trials.

He had already qualiﬁed for a
shot at the Olympic team in his
backstroke events, but tl'1er-rtnhe
rules on legal turns werechanged

and he must qualify again with,

faster times.

"I think I am capable of reaching
those times and my coaches
agree,” Brady said.

One of the pressures of being
a first-year student was relieved
when he arrived on campus with
a web of close friends. '

If he has a problem, he knows
he can fall back on the team for
support.

The most supportive and
inﬂuential of "those teammates is
Eric “Cubby” Mattson.

“He and I swim many of the
same events and we train together
a lot,” Brady said. “He is always
in the water, ‘Mr. Reliable’ when
it comes to practice. Whenever I
have trouble I can always look to
him because he is out there giving
it his best.”

“The way they dual in the water
is goodfor the both of them,”

- Knoles said. “Neither of them like

to lose.”

Behind most outstanding
athletes, there are usually
supportive parents, and with
Brady there is no exception. His
father played the role of second
coach until Brady was 14-years-
old. He was at the pool to make
sure his son wasn't “doggin’ it” at
practices and was up in the stands
for the meets.

“My mother doesn’t know much
about the sport though,” Brady
said. “I could swim a 50 free in an
hour and she would still say
‘good job’ as long as the effort
was there."

There are mixed reviews to
IUPUI’s newly implemented
three—day-a-week classes which
began last semester. Previously,
most classes lasted 70 minutes
and were twice a week. With the
schedule change, courses now
meet three times a week for 50
minutes.

Many students object to the
new schedule because many now
have Friday classes. Professors
object that the class periods are
too short and there is not enough
time to discuss something
completely.

Delivery  

service
brings
it home

By Ron Turri

_ For The Pitt News

Are you tired of ordering pizza,
calzone and wedgies? Did you
ever wish your favorite restaurants
delivered? Well, wishes can come
true with Wheel Deliver.

Started three years ago by Tom
Baron and Mike Hanley, the
service delivers for 16 restaurants
including the Balcony, Great Scot,
Hotlicks, Darbar, Minutel1o’s and
the Peking Gourmet Kitchen.

The drivers deliver to houses

' and apartments from Squirrel Hill

to downtown. _

Aside from its delivery duties
Wheel Deliver also offers a few
perks reminiscent of room service
at a luxury hotel, including
candles and flowers for romantic
dinners for two.

Delivery takes roughly 45
minutes with a minimum order of
$10.

Wheel Deliver charges a 15-
percent fee with a minimum fee
of $2.95 and a maximum of $6.
And Miss Manners would en-
courage tipping the driver.

Wheel Deliver is in the process
of updating its Dining Guide.
The new guide will be out in mid-
February with new restaurants
being added.

Wheel Deliver is open for lunch
Monday through Friday 11:30 to
2:30 and dinner every night 4 to
10.

Cheesy rider
Pitt News’pick for best
delivered pizza in area

 

By Megan Bertino
and Jenna Ferrara
News Editors

For those of you who think
being an editor at The Pitt News is
just pizza and beer, you’re wrong.
It was pizza and diet Coke for
those attending the “Pitt News
Dining Guide Great Pizza Feed”
last week.

Armed with only checklists, a
table of unmarked pizzas and
warm soda to cleanse our dis-
criminating palates, a panel of
editors and writers delved into a
veritable orgy of tomato sauce,
cheese and grease — all this so
that our shameless promotion of
a dining guide could feature the
sort of scientific research you've
come to demand from 7776 Pitt
News.

While this may seem like fun"
and games to you, our loyal
readership, it actually made us all
want to write lengthy, embittered
testimonials for future use in

 
  

Rolaids commercials. Our hearts
were heavy, but our stomachs
were valiant.

But enough of these blatant
appeals for pity. You're probably
wondering, “How did my favor-
ite pizza do after being tested
under these auspicious, intensely
regulated circumstances?"

Well, wonder no more. Not
Just Pizza emerged as the pie of
choice among your favorite stu-
dent journalists

“Nice balance between cheese
and sauce,” observed incisive
photo editor Jason “Salvatore”
Hillman.

“A very distinctive taste; a sur-
prise to the palate,” said sports
editor Derek “Luigi” Willis, barely
pausing to wipe the sauce from
the corners of his mouth..

Sports editor Rob “Mario”
Mazur’s comments were, “Just
the right amount of garlic, tasty
crust and not too chewy.” Jacob
“Guiseppe” Brody commented,
“Tasty, good spices, very nice

' Pizza Hut and Napo1i’s tied for

was described as “excellent, es-

remarked that Napo1i’s pizza had
an “ultra—ﬂuffy crust, thickest

Little Italy, which came in fourth
in the pizza sweepstakes, was
highly commended for its dis-

"It had a delicious, spicy taste,"
remarked editor in chief and

Metro and Sbarro tied for fifth.

By Michael King
For T be Pitt News

When University of Pittsburgh students
feel the uncontrollable urge to bury their
faces in a plate of beef chop suey, to inhale
a half dozen egg rolls or to chug a bowl of
wonton soup, an establishment able to
accommodate them awaits practically a
few steps away from their front doors.

The Oriental restaurants in Oakland are
second in number only to the flock of
pizza parlors. Five Oriental eateries are
located on Forbes Avenue between the
Original Hot Dog Shop and Giant Eagle,
each of which is capable of offering
praiseworthy meals to satisfy any stir—fry
craving from Sesame Beef to shrimp lo
mein.

The Szechuan Express, found on the
100 block of Oakland Avenue, offers a 34-
item menu with prices ranging from $3.75
for all of the poultry, beef and pork stir-
fries, to $6 for the General Tsao’s Chicken.

“I like Szechuan Express,” said Jack
Kraft, a first-year Pitt medical school stu-
dent, “It’s cheap, and they give you a lot
of food  It’s pretty much an institution.”

Szechuan’s lo mein dishes are insur-
mountable. If you are a fan of those

squiggly brown noodles tossed with pork,
shrimp, chicken, beef or vegetables,
Szechuan’s are worth trying for only $3.75.
For the cost-conscious hungry, Szechuan
Express is a winner.

Another winner, and the next stop on
the stroll down Forbes Avenue, is Winner’s.
Because it's located under Metro Pizza, all
you can see of Winner’s from the road is
an intimidating stairwell.

But don’t let this scare you off, because
the best Korean cuisine in Oakland awaits
your chopsticks.

This subterranean eatery, illuminated
by lights of a six—pack refrigerator, offers
a popular dish called Bi Bim Bub, affec-
tionately called No. 17.

This is a scrumptious array of radishes,
sprouts, beef, and spinach, all in their
individual piles atop a mound of rice. As
if this were not enough, Winner’s crowns
the entire meal with a fried egg. This taste-
bud tickler costs $5 and is served with a
cup of chicken broth and a green salad.

Next stop on the Orient on Forbes tour
is the Hong Kong Express, located at 3607
Forbes Avenue.

Upon entering the restaurant, the
shocking orange decor makes you feel as
if you have just fallen into a huge bowl of

Sweet and Sour Shrimp.

This happily colored establishment of-
fers a 77-item menu with prices ranging
from around $5 for the chow mein, chop
suey and lo mein, to about $7 for the
seafood, chicken and beef dishes.

“It’s really the only Chinese place I go,”
said Steve Cornell, a third year Pitt law
school student, “My favorite is their General
Tsao’s Chicken.”

General Tsao’s Chicken is grilled chicken
breast and broccoli, blanketed in a brown
sauce which Offers a taste medley of
sweet, sour and spicy. This meal costs
$8.00 every day except Monday, when it
is featured for only $4.25.

Another commendable dish is the Fri-
day special of Shrimp and Lobster Sauce.
It’s worth a try on Fridays for $4.25 and
costs $7.25 any other day.

The remaining two Chinese restaurants
on Forbes Avenue are the Bamboo Gar-
den and The House of Chaing. Both are a

bit more expensive than the aforemen- V

tioned three, but at either establishment
you won’t have to eat out of a Styrofoam
eat—al1. ‘

_The Bamboo Garden features a lunch
menu with an average price of $4 a
meal.The dinner menu is more expensive

with an average price of $6.50 a meal.

Worth trying is the Seafood with Sizzling
Rice, a wonderful combination of lobster,
crab, shrimp and scallops, stir-fried with
vegetables in a white wine sauce. This
dish, the tastiest of all items on the Chefs
Specialty menu, is well worth the price of
$9.99. ’

The last stop on the Forbes Avenue
Chinese food circuit is The House of
Chaing. Located across from Giant Eagle,
The House of Chaing boasts the most
expensive house specialties in Oakland
ranging in price from $7.25 for the Moo
Goo Gai Pan (a chicken and Chinese
vegetable dish) to $13.95 for the Crab Leg
Cantonese.

If you’re not responsible for paying the
bill, try The House ofChaing’s Lobster Tail
Cantonese. For $18.95. this scrumptious
dish will dazzle you with shelled lobster
tail touched with garlic and tossed with
black beans and eggs.

If you are brave enough to venture out
of Oakland in Search of Oriental cuisine,
your choices are endless. Squirrel Hill is
home to a great number of Chinese res-
taurants but worth mentioning are the
Dumpling House and the Peking Gourmet

Ice cream is an international

treat that has become synony-
mous with birthday parties, pic-
nics and depression. Although
it’s never been researched, it could ,
be the most highly abused sub-
stance on earth.

More addictive than cocaine,

more fattening than mayonnaise
— ice cream is something students
just can’t get enough of. So where
does a person go when the
craving strikes?

Oakland has three options:.

Dave & Andy’s, Baskin-Robbins,

and for the health conscious, The
Country’s Best Yogurt (TCBY).

“I love Dave & Andy’s. It's kind
of like a Pitt tradition. You have
to eat there at least once,” said
Pitt senior Arthur Connor.

“We were voted by Pittsburgh
Magazine as ‘Best Ice Cream’ in
the city for two years — same
with In Pittsburgh,” said store
owner Andy Hardie, who said
much of Dave & Andy’s success
probably comes from the fresh-
ness of the products.

All ice cream is made with a 14-
percent butterfat ice-cream mix.
A multitude of other ingredients
are added to produce ﬂavors like

Dinner on spare change

You woke up late. The line at the 7-Eleven is out the door. It’s
too early to stomach a burger from Roy’s, and your professor is
taking attendance in five minutes. So where do you turn? The
change machine in the Cathedral vending room is your ticket to

culinary adventure.

The vending room offers a veritable feast of cookies, candy
bars, soda and juice for the intellectual on the go. Students can
buy anything from bagel chips to apples in the vending room,
located on the Cathedral’s ground floor.

Also offered via the vending machines are more substantial
microwaveable foods including chimichangas, burritos and
meatloaf sandwiches. A microwave is provided as well. -

For those chilly winter days the vending machines offer hot
chocolate, tea and coffee, but beware‘-— the cups were never
recognized for their outstanding size. I

—Dave & Andy’s has had 300

400 gallons of Dave & Andy’s ice
cream are sold a week during the
peak seasons of spring and fall.
During the winter about 120

gallons a week are sold.

Noted for its 31-derful ﬂavors,
Baskin—Robbins (at Fifth Avenue

THE PITT NEWS DINING GUIDE

The dreamy, creamy world of everyone’s favorite dessert:

for any true ice—cream lover.

Aside from the old standbys
like Mint Chocolate Chip, Baskin-
Robbins has a wide selection of
ﬂavors guaranteed to please ice-
cream connoisseurs, including
Peanut Butter ‘n’ Chocolate, Ba-
nanas ‘n’ Strawberry, Cherries
Jubilee and Caramel Chocolate
Crunch. For those who have
forsaken ice cream for the
healthier alternative, TCBY is lo-
cated near the corner of Oakland
and Forbes avenues. ”

‘‘It’s a new age. Everyone wants
to be healthy,” said store manager
Andy Shivey.

TCBY features regular frozen

 

yogurt that’s 96-percent fat-free
and half the calories of ice cream,

and nonfat frozen yogurt, which ‘

also contains no cholesterol. The
store also carries nonfat sugar-
free yogurt made with

TCBY’s frozen yogurt comes in

ﬂavors such as Golden Vanilla, '

White Chocolate Mousse, Cher-

But themost popular item on

the TCBY menu is the Shiver,

according to Shivey. A Shiver is
frozen yogurt blended with a
topping such as M&Ms, Heath

In the midnight hour there are still places to dine

By Matt Major
For The Pitt News

McDonald's, Roy's and Rax have locked
their doors for the night. The bars are
tossing the last of the stragglers out, and
that Kierkegaard you've been reading
for the last six hours is swimming before
your eyes like a TV test pattern.

Then it happens —- your stomach
growls. Slovenly and bedraggled, you
wander the streets of Oakland searching
for something to satiate those late-night
munchies. ,

Charlie’s, formerly known as “G’s”
annexed to Mitchell's bar, has a menu
that encompasses a wide range of food,
but its specialty is sandwiches.

Charlie’s is also known for its atmo-

sphere. Rock memorabilia and posters
cover the walls, and classic tunes drift
from a small radio maintained by the
staff.

According to Pitt junior Sean McCaffery,
Charlie’s offers “the closest thing in the
area to a real Philadelphia cheesesteak."

It’s open until 4 a.m., and it is a good
place to visit with a gang of friends after
the bars in North Oakland close.

The next late—night restaurant worth
visiting is Primanti’s, located downtown
in the Strip and in Oakland on Forbes
Ave.

Primanti’s is home to the “all-in—one”
sandwich in which cole slaw and fries
are included — inside the sandwich.

Jeff Long, manager of the Oakland
location, said this tradition “started on

the -Strip back in the early '30s. Truckers
in a hurry to eat would simply throw
everything on the sandwich and go.”

Both locations serve beer until 2 a.m.
Sandwiches come in traditional deli va-
rieties, from roast beef to bologna. Both
locations are open until 3 a.m. on week-
days, 4 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, and
2 a.m. on Sunday.

The White Tower, open 24 hours,
usually ﬁlls up with all types of interesting
people at 2 a.m., usually fallout from
Chiefs and the Luna.

This place offers a standard (but some-
what limited) diner-type menu, and most
entrees can be had for under $4.

Located just under the Towers on

‘Forbes, The “O” offerings have become

standard Pitt-student fare. Its fries and

hot dogs are legendary. A hot dog costs
about $2.50 and an extra—1arge order of
friesicosts $5.

It offers a selection of hot sandwiches
and a variety of hot entrees. A recent
addition to the menu is the infamous
$2.99 large pizza.

All food is available for take out, and
the place is open from 6 a.m. to 4 a.m.

Of course, this list would not be com-
plete without including Ritter’s Diner,
located on Baum Boulevard and open 24
hours, seven days a week. Ritter’s is a
genuine diner all the way to the mini
juke boxes in each booth. ,

The menu boasts a wide selection of
food and the best breakfast selections
around. A full meal costs about $6, and
you will not leave hungry.

Weekly specials make Oakland eateries all the more tasty

By Mike Laughlin
Staff Writer

Many Oakland restaurants of-
fer weekly specials to lure hun-
gry Pitt students through their
doors. *

The Medina Cantina on ()ak—
land Avenue depends on students
for 80 percent of its business,
according to night manager Don
Pasc. Specials are run every week,

with a new one starting every
Monday.

Sometimes the Medina Cantina
will try to reach out to vegetarians
by making meatless meals a
special, such as a taco salad mi-
nus the beef.

Specials at the Medina Cantina
cost about $2.99, and include a
soft drink.

land might be an alternative.
Dinner specials are run every
night and prices range from $7.95
to $11.95.

A 12- to 14-ounce New York

“Business slows down "during

when students have money and
go splurge,” said Charles
Wallender, head cook at Charlie’s.

Zelda’s on Forbes Avenue of-
fers chicken wings on Monday
nights and gives away pizza on
Friday nights.

If students feel like staying in
their residence halls or apartments
for the evening, ordering out for
dinner is an attractive alternative.

Steve Thomas, half-owner of
Niko’s Gyros on Semple Street,
said Niko’s delivers to all resi-
dence halls and to most apart-
ments in South Oakland.

Niko’s offers $1 off on all de-

South Craig St. offers
myriad of restaurants

By Gregory Rea
For The Pitt News

It may not be Greenwich Village, but South Craig Street offers
Oakland more diversity than can usually be found at the “O”.

Nestled amid small stores ﬁlled with silver and brass jewelry,
hand—woven sweaters and cloth shoes are restaurants that
sample the globe.

If you like elegance, an excellent wine list, outstanding service
and French food that will make your mouth water and wallet
lighter, make reservations for the Cafe Azure.

Don’t be intimidated by the French on the menu; the
restaurant has translated each dish into English, and the
tuxedoed waiters don’t mind when guests point to their selection.

A few favorites are the grilled duck breast ($18 a plate) and
the succulent Saumon grille avec Fumet de Poisson au Vin
Rouge ($19.50 a plate).

Each order of the grilled duck breast comes with a dried
apricot chutney compound. Saumon grille is a grilled Norwe-
gian salmon served on a bed of braised red cabbage with a light
red wine fish stock and fresh herbs. It may sound a little difficult
to pronounce and understand, but it is very easy to eat.

If you go, don’t forget your credit cards or your tie. This
elegant restaurant doesn’t like jeans and sneakers, and the
average price of dinner for two is between $50 to $100.

Is the restaurant worth so much money? If you’re looking for
a small cozy place to eat on an anniversary, formal night or other
special occasion, then the answer is yes. But if you’re waiting for
Choice Dollars to be available, then you may be waiting outside
for quite some time.

If you want to be a bit cheaper but still classy, walk right next
door to. Great Scot.

Great Scot looks like a cross between Cheers and CJ. Barney's
with a Scottish twist. A large brass-reeled bar covers one side of
the restaurant, and surrounding the bar are old wooden tables
and benches that are bolted to the walls. This restaurant is neat
and well—kept, and jeans and and a sweatshirt are acceptable
attire. ‘

Among the house specialities are beer—batter ﬁsh sandwiches
($5.75) and the crunch burger ($6.25). The beer—batter fish is cod
dipped in beerand deep fried. The crunch burger comes with
bean sprouts, water chestnuts and is covered with soy sauce and
American cheese.

All sandwiches and burgers are served with cole slaw and
fresh white potato chips. Sweet potatochips are available upon
request. .

If you’re looking for a place to recover from Saturday night,
Great Scot serves Sunday brunch from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

If the Middle Eastern peace talks have made your stomach

By Heather Gahres
For The Pitt News

Shopping and food seem to go
hand in hand. Every mall has its
own food court, usually includ-
ing pizza, Chinese food, fast food
and a french-fry place.

Shadyside’s shopping haven,
Walnut Street, is no different.
intermixed with Banana Repub-
lic and The Gap is a wide variety
of restaurants to suit whatever
mood you may be in.

If you enjoy burgers or chicken
sandwiches but don’t like all the
grease, Cappy’s Cafe is for you. It
has a-special “no—grease” frying

technique that uses a hot-air oven
for french fries and bread, while
the burgers and chicken are made
on a grill.

The atmosphere is somewhat
reminiscent of NBC’s “Cheers,”
except there are friendly wait-
resses here.

T here’s even a crew of regulars
around the bar.

Rich Jock, who eats at Cappy’s
every Sunday, described what

, brings him back.

“It’s convenient, not expensive.
The food is good. The service is
good, and the rest rooms are very
clean.”

THE PITT NEVVS DINING GUID

 

By Alissa Smith
For The Pitt News

When Pitt students prepare to
unwind with pitchers of
~Budweiser, or chow down on
large pizzas, hamburgers and
greasy french fries, anxiety begins
for the Oakland food server.

A Each hopes for the best: no
under—agers trying to get served
and then stiffmg on the tip, no
obnoxious drunks chanting songs
_ , anddemandingalcohol and most
f ' importantly, no vomiting under
I’ the table.

They pray they won’t drop trays.
They hope for many good tips

_and few separate checks.

With all the possibilities for
' disaster, it may be hard to un-
I derstand why anyone would want
to be a waiter or waitress. The
obvious answer is the money.

On an average weekend night,
food servers can make between
$60 and $80. But Tammy Viglione,
a waitress and manager at C.}.
Barney’s, said she stays at her job
mainly because of the people she

E

Servers dish inside info

works with.

“We're all friends,” she said.
“We get together and do things
outside of work. I think you’ll see
that happening at a lot of places."

Viglione, who attends graduate
school at Pitt, has been working
at C.}.’s for over three years and
as a waitress for 12. She described
waitressing in Oakland as fast-
paced and hectic. “Wing night is
hell It gets crowded very
quickly. Everyone wants imme-
diate service.”

Alan Crawford, who has been
a waiter at Hemingway's Cafe for
the past three years, said his
favorite part of food serving is
when customers are appreciative.

“I like it when people enjoy
good service and it shows in their
tip,” he said.

Crawford said college students
are more impatient and leave
smaller tips than other customers.

Because poor tipping is a pri-
mary pet peeve of food servers,

Viglione described “the bottom
line: leave a nice tip and the [food

bar, Sushi Too.

Raw fish may not sound ap-
petizing, but it's worth trying
just for the traditional Japanese
atmosphere.

Patrons have the choice of
sitting at the sushi bar, which
houses the fish under glass to
choose from, or sitting at a
Western—style table. But bring
your checkbook because a meal
can cost you from $8.95 to
$19.95.

Sushi Too owner Mike Chen,
who also owns the China Pal-
ace two doors down the street,
said, “The China Palace received
’a ﬁve-fork rating from the Post-
Gazette. This I know will get
one too.”

The China Palace is a formal

restaurant specializing in Man-
darin, Human and Szechuan
food. Manager'Lee Sew said,
“The food and service quality
is what makes it unique as
compared to other restaurants.
It is a more personal type of

, service.” _
Prices range from $5.50 and

$16.95.

Pitt junior Eric Emenheiser
said, “The staff was incredibly
friendly. It is more expensive,
but the food and service were
well worth it.”

Inside The Theatre are two
more restaurants: The Balcony
and Hotlicks.

Both serve great food and
are owned by Muzz Meyers,
but that is where the similari-
ties end. '

The Balcony is a more formal
restaurant, with a white grand
piano in the center of the res-
taurant.

On Monday nights you can
hear the Balcony Big Band

perform live, and on the other
six days there are a variety of
live jazz performers.

The specialties are grilled
dinner entrees ranging in price
from $10 to $15.

Every Monday and Tuesday it
has all-you-can eat lobster for
$24.50.

Hotlicks is a casual restaurant
that offers a TV for sporting
events and a variety of live
entertainers ranging from
country to techno—pop. The
specialty is barbeque ribs and
chicken, and on Wednesday
and Thursday it serves 25—cent
wings.

So if you’re tired of the Oak-,
land restaurants, just looking
for adventure and don’t mind
spending a little more, head for
Walnut Street.

Take either the 71B or 71D at
FifthAvenue, ride to SouthAiken
Street, walk three blocks to the
left and try some of the restau-
rants.

growl, then cross the street to Ali
Baba.

Ali Baba is a South Craig ﬁxture
with its own legend as to how it
got started. Thehouse specialties
include shish kebab" ($9.95) and
"chicken delight ($6.95)'."' L 

Each shish.’ kebab ‘comes with
tender chunks of lamb and beef
meat. _It is served with a large dish
of tossed salad and a dish of rice
with pignolia nuts. _ 

Many meals ‘c‘a:i'ri’ibe madeto
order for vegetarians, _an"d-‘the
average cost for dinne'r"is $’1'0'per
person. _ ,  A ' 

The Star of India"has nine
vegetarian dinners to offer for its
costumers. Aloo gobhi ($6.95)
and tarka daal (6.95) are among
two of the best to choosefrom.

Aloo gobhi comes with fresh
cauliﬂower and sauteed potatoes
stir-fried with mild to medium
spices. . ‘

Tarka daal is a vegetarian plate
that comes with an assortment of
lentils and garlics. _ «

The S_tar ofllndia also has many
different lunch specials; curry

lunch ($ 6.45) is made with lamb '

curry or beef curry, dal, raita or
salad, nan or rice. The tandoori
lunch is a chicken dish that also
comes with dal, rice or nan, salad
or raita.

If you’re looking for a change
of pace'for ice—cream desserts,
then try Star of lndia’s mango ice
cream. You won’t find any des-
sert like this in Oakland: it will
definitely put a chill in your
stomach and a tang in your mouth.

Still not far East enough? Around
the corner from the Star of India
is the Yum Wok. This spotless
restaurant specializes in Chinese
favorites such as General Tsao’s
Chicken and Moo Goo Gal Pan.
The prices are reasonable, and
the service is quick.

If you’re just stopping by for a
quick bite or hungry enough to
eat a three-course meal, try the
honey chicken appetizer. The
taste will surprise even the best
Chinese food expert.

are only 3.25?

Bring a date and share a plate!
Available only Monday nights at
Peter’s, wings come in two grades,
hot and mild.

Personal tastes are accommo-
dated, and Lisa Tesone, a wait-
ress at Peter’s, recalled how she
has seen “plates of wings swim-
ming in hot peppers.”

Definitely not for amateurs.
Peter’s also runs beer specials to
help extinguish the fire.

After a couple of days of re-
covery, just down the street from
Peter’s another wing night is be-
ginning. On Wednesdays at
Caleco’s, from 8 p.m. to midnight
wings are being served for $3 for
15, or 20 for $3.50.

Again, beer specials are run to
cool your tastebuds. Hot, medium
or mild selections give enough
choice so that even those who
don’t care for spicy, hot foods
can still enjoy the special.

But for those who do like their
wings hot, Colleen Carey, who
prepares all the wings on wing
night, will doctor them up just as
hot as you’d like. The wings are
served with carrots, celery and
blue cheese dressing.

If you haven’t gotten your fill
or are barred from Caleco’s for
lewd behavior, don’t despair —
the wings are ﬂyin’ Wednesday
nights at C]. Barney’s, just around
the corner on Forbes Avenue.

At only 20 cents per wing
combined with 33-cent drafts, for
about'$5 you can eat and drink

their fill without having any’

trouble getting ‘home. (Well,
maybe just a little trouble.)
After Pitt's victory over Syra-

cuse, Mark Zeiden, .a first-year ’

Pitt law student, enjoyed a plate
of extra hot wings.

“Just tell the waitress to tell the
cook he’s a (expletive deleted),
and the wings come out perfect

sinus—c1earing aroma emanating
from his plate, he could have
been right.

There are three soups daily
($1.50 per cup, $1.95 per
bowl), at least one of which
is vegan.

Lunches cost from $2.75
(for a nut butter and jelly
sandwich) to $5 (for “Sloppy
T’s” made with organic
tempeh and tofu).

Dinners are $4.75 to $9.25;
entrees include Spinach La-
sagna, Black Bean Tortilla,
and daily chefs specials.
Many of the desserts are
vegan.

If you end up in a res-
taurant with no vegetarian
selections (or only a baked
potato and salad), remem-
ber that you can always ask
for a specially prepared dish,
without the meat or cheese,
according to your dietary
desires.

busiest night for wingers because
many Oakland bars have specials.
The SOD at the corner of Bates
and Semple streets features a
plate for $3.

Usually 18 to 20 come per
order and are available in hot,
medium, or mild.

There aren’t any beer specials,
but a jukebox is provided for
entertainment.

T hirsty’s at 301 North Craig
Street also has its weekly wing-a-
thon on Thursdays. Mild, hot or
extra hot cost $5 for 12.
Moosehead beer is on special at
75 cents a draft or $4.50 for a
pitcher to keep those extra hots
from getting out of control.

For something a little different,
Hotlicks at 5520 Walnut St. in
Shadyside offers wings prepared
differently from the rest. While
other fry the win gs, Hotlicks grills
them over mesquite and then
adds barbeque sauce.

The wings are also not cut in
half like other places but are left
whole instead. On Thursdays,
the special starts at 5 p.m., and
includes 25—cent wings as well as
$2 Mexican beers.

One place worth a mention,
especially after the bars close, is

food is prepared with low salt

It also carries everything you
need to grace your own wok at

Oriental groceries from bushel

Practically next door to the

Gourmet Kitchen. This restau-
rant provides a more formal
dining environment, but you
could still feel comfortable
walking in wearing a '1'-shirt
and a ball cap.

Worth trying is the Peking

The China Palace was voted
the Best New Asian Restaurant
of 1990 by the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, and Pittsburgh Maga-
zine praised its Flower Basket
Medley.

This dish is a combination of
shrimp, scallops, chicken and
vegetables in a crisp egg-noodle
shell and sells for $14.95. China
Palace brews ‘up an intense
crab meat and corn soup for

edition in 1990.

The Dim Sum menu offers
pastries, dumplings, pig stom-
achs and more. The average
Dim Sum dish costs about $3
and the average person could
eat three or four dishes. This
results in a fairly expensive
brunch, but it is well worth the
money.

lfyou find yourselfon Walnut
Street in Shadyside, there are
two commendable Oriental res-
taurants: the China Palace and

$3.50, which buys a portion for
two people.

The final Oriental restaurant
worth mention is called Sushi
Too. It is located at 5432 Wal-
nut Street and features a wide
range of sushi from raw tuna to
smoked eel.

Sushi Too’s dinner menu is a
bit expensive, with prices
ranging from $9 to $19. Worth
trying is Sushi Too’s lunch
specials. For $5.50 you can
choose from a menu of 10
items that are_served with soup
and a salad
