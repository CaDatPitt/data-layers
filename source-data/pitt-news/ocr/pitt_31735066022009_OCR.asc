UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Student
denies  
attacking
aﬂendant

By Kelley Butt

Assistant News Editor

A student accused of assaulting
a Tower C desk attendant is now

claiming that the attendant initiat- .

ed the altercation.
Now facing a hearing before

the Studentludicial Board for the-

incident, Michael Haas denies
that he attacked desk attendant
William Forbus.

According to Haas, he was
waiting at the security desk for
Rosemarie Pugliese and a friend.

_ Pugliese, also a resident of Tow-

er C, was signing her guestin.

Pugliese said, ’’I put my ID on
the book before I signed my
friend in. I walked over to the

door and was still holding my ID

up for himito see.”

Haas and Pugliese said that
Forbus became ”verbally abu-
sive” and shouted that he didn't
see Pug|iese’s ID. Pugliese
claimed that Forbus didn't. see her
ID because he had been ”talking
to someone the entire time” she
was signing her friend in.

According to university police
reports,‘Forbus was looking at
Pug|iese’s ID when Haas took it
away, complainingthat Pugliese
was being harassed by Forbus.

Haas said that following the in-
cident ”a hot, verbal argument”
ensued. '

Haas said that Forbus picked
up the phone and started to dial.
Forbus presumably called cam-
pus police.

University bylaws state that-a
desk attendant must call the RA
or RD on duty before calling the
police.

Kimberly Jones, the RD on duty
that night, did not show up at the
scene. She could not be reached
for comment.

According to Haas, he asked

Forbus who he was calling. For-
bus refused to tell him. When

'Haas reached for‘the depressor

hooks on the phone, Forbus al-
legedly swung the receiver at
him, hitting Hass’ right wrist.

Haas said, ”I reacted and
slapped his glasses of.”

Haas charged that although the
campus police took Forbus’ state-
ment, they would not take his
(Hass’) statement.

Forbus declined to comment
on the matter.

After apartheid —what then?

By Lisa Benado
For The Pitt News

Taking the apartheid of South
Africa a giant step further to its af-
termath, a series of workshops
last week sought to postulate fu-
ture educational and politcal re-
forms in post—apartheid South
Africa. » _

’’It is important to discuss re-

form options prior to the time
they would be implemented,”

said Dennis Brutus, chairman of .

the black studies department and
South African political exile.

The workshops, the second in
a series of three, were composed
of several prominent speakers
knowledgable about the issues
confronting South Africa and
were followed by audience dis-
cussions.

”We are going beyond just
educating people about the strug-
gle itself," said Monica-Frolander,
associate professor of anthropol-
ogy at Pitt-Johnstown, adding that
the academic community has the
luxury of time .to devote to
analyzing the situation that the
people inside South Africa lack.

Educational reform was one of
the key topics considered be-
cause of its impact on the mold-
ing of people's attitudes and the
perception of their places in
society.

In the past, the goal of educa-
tion has been to teach people
only enough to enable them to
meet industry requirements, said
Mokubung Nkomo, professor at
the University of North Carolina,
in a paper presented during the
workshop.

The new system must ”be ac-
tive rather than passive in its cre-
ation of the new person," he said.
”It must maximize potential in-
herent in each individual and
match that with the idea ofa
comprehensive national iden
tity.”

Ithas been estimated that less
than one half of the black adults
can read and write in South
Africa.

Among the suggestions

presented was the pressing neces— _

sity for the improvement of a
black teacher education program,
a higher priority to scientific and
technical education within the
curriculum and a massive litera-
cy campaign beginning immedi-
ately. These points were
summarized by Dr. Lloyd Bond,
department of psychology at Pitt.

Political restructuring was also
addressed to improve a system

- that has impoverished millions of

South Africans.

An emphasis on reallocating
resources must be made, accord-
ing to Ann Seidman of Clark

with

major problem is that ”most peo-

ple are unemployed or working
at low productive activities on the
one hand, where on the other

hand there has been a develop-'

ment of a highly capitalist inten-
sive modern sector which is
controlled by the white minority
and transnational corporations.”

The current unemployment
rate in South Africa is between 40
to 50 percent, including starva-
tion due to a lack of income, land
or jobs for the black population,
according to Seidman.

She also pointed out the need
to redirect military spending to
social development, to restruc-

_ture trade relations and to con- _

sider not only the national

economy but the regional econ-'

omy in developing reforms.

The symposium concluded
the film Witness to
Apartheid. '

Overall, Brutus said the discus-
sions were ”penetrating and
thought provoking” with active
audience participation, although
there was a dissapointing turn—out
of student body. _

The results of the ideas present-
ed are intended to be published
by the University of Pittsburgh,
and Brutus said he hopes they
can be of some assistance to the
South African society before long.

gineers tried Sunday to right_ a
capsized British ferry in an effort
to retrieve the bodies of 82 peo-

ple believed trapped in the half- . I 

submerged vessel off the Belgian
coast. .
Relatives of passengers, mean-

. while, went to a makeshift mor-, ' ’

gue in a basketball court to

On Sunday, two salvage ship
carrying giant cranes moved in
on the stricken vessel. The un-
recovered corpses were pre-

sumed trapped under. heavy 
debris or in sections of theboatfx

inaccessible to divers.

Reporters flying overhead saw f

one crane perpendicular to the

keel. Salvage crews were attach— '

ing a steel cable to the orange-
and-white hull. Several tugboats
stood by on a calm sea.

The operation was suspended I I

at nightfall, after about three
hours. A
Officals said Sunday it was ex-
tremely unlikely anyone was still
alive inside the vessel and that it

”We cannot get more bodies

White House did not violate reporting requirements

WASHINGTON — An in-
house adviser to Attorney Gener-
al Edwin Meese, in an opinion is-
sued shortly after disclosure of
the U.S. arms sales to Iran, said
the White House did not violate
congressional reporting require-
ments, and that an oral go-ahead
from President Reagan was suffi-
cient for one of the shipments.

The legal opinions by Assistant
Attorney General Charles J.
Cooper, which back the Reagan
administration's handling of the
arms sales, are sharply at odds
with the conclusions reached by
the Tower Commission.

The legal memoranda, pre-
pared for Meese and supplied to
the Tower board, were released
last week in response to a request
from The Associated Press.

One legal opinion by Cooper
concludes there was no violation
of a requirement under the Na-
tional Security Act for timely
notification of Congress when the
administration failed to tell key
congressmen about the arms
sales.

Israel blocks public

discussion on scandal

JERUSALEM — Three Cabinet
ministers on Sunday demanded
an official probe into the Pollard
spy scandal, which one minister
said has caused ”unprecedented
damage” to U.S.—Israe|i ties.

But the government blocked
public discussion by referring the
debate to a secret Cabinet com-
mittee.

”The Cabinet has no right to
hide information from the
government,” said Communica-
tions Minister Amnon Rubinstein,
one of three ministers who asked
for an inquiry at the weekly Cabi-
net session.

outside and shot Peter McGetti—
gan to death, police said.

’’I’m not saying what he did
was justified; I can't explain all of
what he did. But every man has
his breaking point. He didn't
want anything to happen to his
family,” Mrs. Smith said Friday.

Smith is being held without
bail while awaiting trial on a
murder charge. He is to be ar-
raigned Thursday before Com-
mon Pleas CourtJudge Charles L.
Durham.

According to police, Smith said
a snowball had crashed through
his living room window the night
of Jan. 29, showering broken
glass on his daughter Ethel, 18,
and cutting her face.

HARRISBURG — The state
Republican Party, picking up the

pieces from last year's guber-
natorial loss and the death of state
Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer, en-

monwealth Court.

But the Republican State Com-
mittee delayed endorsing the
retention bids of two incumbent
state judges, Supreme Court
Justice Rolf Larsen and Common-

‘wealth Court President Judge

James Crumlish.

The committee, following the
recommendation of its leadership
committee, agreed to endorse

Democrats will choose their can-
didates later this month.

83 out of 100 children will be victims of crime  

By Donna Cassatta

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Thejustice
Department said Sunday that five
out of six of-today's 12-year-olds
will be the victims or intended
victims of violent crimes during
their lifetimes if current crime

I rates persist.

Half of them will be victimized
more than once, authorities said
in a report based on projections
from a decade of surveys on the
extent of crime.

The report said that the lifetime
odds of becoming a victim of vio-
lent crimes — rape, robbery and
assault — decline rapidly with
age.

Nearly one out of 12 females

will be the victim of an attempt-
ed or completed rape. For black
females, the odds are one out of
nine, according to the Bureau of
Justice statistics. 0

The study, based on figures
compiled by the government's
National Crime Survey from
1975 through 1984, said that 45
percent of black males will be-
come victims of violent crime
three or more times, almost dou-
ble the possibility for black fe-

. males (24 percent) and triple the

likelihood for white females (13
percent). Thirty-seven percent of
white males are likely to be vic-
timized three or more times.
With age, ”the likelihood of
becoming the victim of a violent
crime in the remainder of one’s

lifetime declines,” the report
said.

The report also said 72 percent
of the nation's 20-year-olds will
be victimized by violent crimes

’ or attempted crimes.

The bureau publishes crime
victimization rates based on
twice—a-year interviews with
101,000 persons in 49,000
households. They are asked
about their own experiences, in-
cluding any crimes not reported
to the police.

This report was drawn from the
approximately two million inter-
views conducted du_ring the 10
years ending in 1984. The rape
statistics, however, were project-
ed from 1973 to 1982.

The report said a victim's sex

and race appear to have a great-
er effect on the likelihood of be-
ing robbed than on other crimes.

An estimated three in 10 peo-
ple will be victims of a complet-
ed or attempted robbery during
their lifetimes, with blacks almost
twice as likely to be robbed as
whites and males about 70 per-
cent more likely to be robbed
than females.

An estimated two in five peo-
ple will be injured as a result of
a robbery or assault, and about
one in 10 will be injured more
than once,‘the report said.

”The chance of being an" as-
sault victim is much greater than
the risk of being a robbery vic-
tim,” said Steven R. Schlesinger,
director of the bureau. ”The

A, 3. .

likelihood of being a robbery vic-
tim is also much greater than the
chance of being a rape victim.”

The report noted that the ”an-
nual victimization rates” report-
ed by the National Crime Survey
have declined since 1981. lfthat
trend continues, the likelihood of
people being hit by violent crime
during their lifetime will also fall.

Nearly everyone will be the
victim of a personal theft at least
once, with about seven in eight

people victimized three or mor

times, the report said.

During a 20-year period, seven
out of 10 households will be bur-

glarized at least once, and one in .
five households will. have a car

stolen.

University senate urging faculty tofight aid Cuts

By Lisa Hallman
Staff Writer

A The University Senate Admis-
sions and Student Aid Committee
is urging faculty members to
write letters to representatives
and senators protesting the pro-
posed budget cuts in federal aid
to students.

Dr. Charlotte Yang, chairwom-
an of the committee, told mem-
bers at the monthly meeting of
the Faculty Assembly that faculty
members, as well as students,
should write the letters,

Yang also said that the commit-
tee wants the faculty to get more

involved in student recruitment.
A ”We want to make incoming
students feel it's not such an im-
personal campus,” she said.

lf the plan is carried out, visit-
inghigh school students would
be able to meet with a faculty
member and direct their ques-
tions about the university direct-
ly to them.

The admissions and student aid
committee is also interested in
having the university publish a
pamphlet listing the scholarships
and types of financial aid that are
available to graduate students.

The committee has found that
a high number of minority stu-

dents are having to leave the
university because of financial
problems before they complete
their degrees. ”We are investigat-
ing this problem and will try to
see if there is something we can
do for them,” Yang said.

Also discussed was the reduc-
tion in length of faculty contracts.
The university has mandated that
the contracts be reduced to two
terms unless the faculty member

is involved in ’’essential teaching, .

research, administrative or clini-
cal services” that require a year-
round contract.

The Faculty Assembly must ap-
prove the policy before it can' be

sent before the University Senate.
The assembly did not come to a
final decision on the issue and
will present its proposal at next
month's senate meeting.

A The budget policies committee,
chaired’ by Professor Richard
Pratt, is presently working on the
policy.

The community relations com-
mittee is looking into the need for
a conference coordinator at the
university. The coordinator
would make arrangements for
meetings and conferences on

campus. Dr. Leonard Plotnicov, A

chairman of the committee, said
that ”there is the prospect of a

. Holiday Inn behind the Syria

Mosque," which would provide
the conference facilities.
The community relations com-

mittee is also planning to recog-

nize and reward faculty members

who are involved in community .

service.

Faculty Assembly President
Barbara Shore said that the Pitt In-
ternal Campaign has raised well

over $200,000 of its $240,000?

goal. The campaign is ”part of the
annual giving fund in which
faculty and staff have been solicit-
ed,” Shore said.

”lt is one of the evidences of
support of faculty and staff for the
university,” she added. -

Higher activities
fee can only help

The student activities fee, if a recent SGB resolution goes
through, will increase to $32 for full-time students. This

- represents an increase of $8. Tuition for a full—time student is
I upwards of $1,500 — $1500 vs. $8?

The issue here seems to be one of misplaced interest. An in-
crease of $8 in the face of steadily rising tuition costs would
seem to be rather unimportant.

However, a big deal was made of the proposed increase in
the dialogue surrounding the Student Government Board
presidential elections. Why, when the students are faced with
a multitude of problems far more significant than an increase
of less than $10, do we allow such a thing to become important?

For example: We, as the student body, could work for the
improvement of the campus or of the quality of our experience
here. We could busy ourselves thinking about how to deal with
the rising cost of a‘ college education. ,

This is not to suggest that the SGB has been negligent of its
duties. It has been a forward thinking assemblege and a very
goal-oriented group. We must, though, remember that the is-
sues stimulating the most discussion and senseless rhetoric are
not necessarily those of gripping importance.

If we are to continue to make changes that will benefit the
entire student body, we must steer from the arguments that,
in the long view, have a less than serious impact onany of us.
Let the SGB continue to work on the problems within the univer-
sity that actually do make a difference to us. I .

If the activities fee needs to be raised by $8, then let it be
done. If it needs to be $20 higher to fully serve the student or-
ganizations that benefit us all, then by all means raise it. We
should not, though, let iteclipse other, more pressing issues.

have any inclination to find out
what you'd do? I sure don't.

As much as the idea may piss
some of us off, we are all together
in this. We then, however dis-
tasteful it may be, have to live
with each other if we ever want
to find this happiness so many are
willing to die for. To kill for. To
murder for.

If we want peace, the kindlof
peace that supports, not that
needs to be enforced, the kind of
peace that would eliminate the
fear of traveling, we have to get

some things straight.

When we talk about equality,
waving the Constitution around
like a club, shouting about how
we're all free, and if you don't be-
lieve that, you can leave. That
seems like only part of the
picture.

If we want to be free, without
the legal restrictions now stifling
freedom, we have to get along
with everybody.

That means the whites have to
get along with blacks. Not just
hire each other to keep out of jail,
but because it doesn't make any
difference what color our skin is.
We have to get along with the
Soviets. We have to get along
with them in an atmosphere
different from the armed, pacing,
sweaty unease that currently
passes for peace.

We have to get along with each
other, not because it's right or be-
cause it's morally pleasing, but
because we have to. We don't
have anyplace else to go. The
frontiers are all gone, and now
we've got to deal with each
other. It might be a lot easier if we

f\

could just see people, not labels -

and stereotypes. We might have
a chance yet. '

Is the Student Telephone Service power happy?

I want to complain about Pitt's
StudentTelephone Service. The
people in charge seem to be

power happy. I had my phone

service cut off Monday, March 2.

I paid my bill on Friday, Febru-

ary 27, admittedly two days late,

, ‘but even Bell (a real phone com-

pany) gives its customers a month
to pay their bills. When I went in

‘ March 3 to complain, I was told

that my payment had not been
posted, and, therefore, they

‘ couldn't turn my phone back on.

I want to know why it was turned
off in the first place.

’ Has someone in charge of the
STS decided that the students
here get no chance to be late?
That if we don't pay our phone

. bills exactly on time that we will
lose service? If that's the case,

then why don't they send out the
phone ‘bills on the day that they

are dated? Mine was was dated-

February 10, but it wasn't in my
mailbox until the 19th. And I

check my box every day because
I [have] the Press delivered.
We should be given more than
seven days to get the bill paid,
[other bills] generally have at least
14 days between the time you
receive them and the time they
are due. Don't think that I am the
only one whose service was cut
off. One of my roommates paid
her bill on Friday, and her serv-

ice was cut off Sunday but re—_

stored Monday. Another room-
mate paid her bill on Thursday,

_but her service was still cut off

Monday. One day late, and you
lose your service. The strange
thing is [that] she had service un-

til Monday, so I have to think‘

[that] they just turned off every-
one’s service who was late,
perhaps to teach everyone a les-
son. Isn't that power happy? I
think so. ,

lntegrated Artisans *

Is it necessary to promote local
cultural activities? Definitely.
Such projects are an essential
catalyst for our progressive de-
velopment, as well as our social
expression and ambiance.

Realistically, the artistic poten-
tial in the Pittsburgh area is
phenomenal. In a city that prides
itself in its art, culture and ‘ar-
chitectural achievements, it is
alarmingly surprising to find such
a lack of exposure within the art
commun-ity. Obviously, the short-
age of galleries and gallery sup-
port have left vast artistic
resources untapped, stifling the
efforts of neophytes and masters

alike. ‘

Has local disinterest, monetary
complications, the business en-
terprise or the bureaucracy inten-
tionally or . unintentionally
neglected/undermined an ele-
ment of vital importance to the
character of this great v city.
Perhaps ”they” assume that the
few festivals held annually will
suffice, even though an extreme-
ly limited amount of Pittsburgh
artists are able to participate, due
to stringent screening processes,
allocation of vendor priorities
and high entry level cost factors.
Or an evident deduction, that the
planning commission, the parks
administration or college faculty
are too busy (probably so, con-
sidering the extensive cutbacks)
to concern themselves with what
may seem a minor issue.

I believe that when we realize
the positive magnitude of the hu-
man creative force at our disposal
and utilize those assets to assist

Pittsburgh through its Renais-

sance period of redevelopment,
we may break the mesmerizing
spell of neo-generic architecture
and make [a] responsible cultur-
al statement/impact.

How do we initiate changes in
the awareness of private and
commercial sectors and ultimate-
Iy facilitate these institutions with
our innovative services/concepts?

Good question!

Initially, with exposure. Ex-
posure is the opportunity to con-
nect with and influence the
public, of which consist decision
making delegates of the com
munity. -

Art can make a statement of
beauty, refine our environment
and become a vehicle by which
thoughts or emotions [may] be
conveyed. But it can also direct-
ly inspire/motivate society to take
that quantum leap. [...]

THE P|TI' News, Monday, March 9, 1937

”Those who recall the imperi-
al dawn of the Reagan presiden-
cy, those gilded hours when

Nancy dreamed of endowing the

republic with a White House
jewelry collection, and the Gip—
per went horse riding with the
queen. of England.”

We should have heeded the
warning.

”On her desk are photos of her
mother, her father, her kids, and

on the shelves behind her are the _

royals.”

V These quotes are from a short
article published in Penthouse
last month entitled ”Nancy’s
Monarchs.” .

Not until this month has the
public finally taken notice of
Nancy's affinity for royalty.

Some are arguing that she
thinks she’s the president. But
”queen-wanna-be” is a more per-
tinent title.

Nancy was in -town last Oc-
tober to tape Chemical People /I
at WQED and push (no pun in-
tended) her ”just say no” to drugs
campaign.

I was a reporter at the press
conference, and I was afforded
the opportunity to see what was
so special about this woman.

When I was first admitted to
the room, which, incidentally, is
the same place Mr. Rogers tapes,
I was, for one moment, in awe.
This was, after all, the first lady
of the United States. The wife of
the man who runs our country.
The wife of a former small-screen
celebrity, to boot. This was a real
celebrity, I thought.

 

SANSIG

Nobody would even look

twice at the lady in red if she
were not the wife of the presi-
dent. With her frail figureand
mousy voice, she could have
been anybody’s grandmother.

And there I stood, within an
arm's length of her, and I was so
dumbstruck I could barely even
whisper a question. Was this the
Nancy I had seen soimany times
on television entertaining digni-
taries and waving from airplanes,
side—by—side with her husband?
The same woman who sat on Mr.
T's lap?

Television had magnified her
persona for sure.

I kind of felt guilty for thinking:
Was this it? Is this all?

Boy, was I stupid.
This visceral vixen turned out
to be one tough cookie.

By over-mingling in her hus-
band's affairs, she has done noth-
ing but undermine his already

Nancy in thedriver’s seat  

dwindling rapport with the

’ American people. Huh. And we

all thought Walter Mondale was
a wimp.

Although she is, in part, to
blame for some of the unrest in
our executive branch, cannot we
also condemn Reagan himself for
showing all the spine of gummy
worm? He didn't have to listen to
Nancy.

Granted, the man is not in the
best of health, nor is he in his
prime. But I'm tired of the ex-
cuses we have been handed for
forgiving Reagan. The man made
a major blunder.

And while I am exhausted with
the excuses, I still believe he
should be forgiven. Nancy, well,
that may be another story.

The president has two years to
go. It's our obligation to support
him in his final days in office.
Maybe he can get some,money
from the Pentagon to buy one of
those five—year diary’s that come
with the cute little key. Then we

can ask him what he did on Au— '

gust 8.

Short of suggesting a muzzle
for Nancy, maybe we could enter
her in one of those ”Queen for
a Day” contests. That might sati-
ate her for a while, at least until
her husband's term in office
expires.

And who knows, after this
Fawn» Hall fiasco blows over,
maybe Penthouse will offer Nan-
cy enough money to buy some
jewels if she poses in the nude -
or at least enough to buy a crown

.and cape. V '

A little personal strength

Real strength is not the ability

to bench press 300 pounds, run .

three miles under 15 minutes or
aerobicize for five or six hours.
It's not that easy.

If one is truly strong, he or she
can disagree with and overcome
the power of the public.

How do I know? Because I'm
smart (Hey, I write for The Pitt
News). But if you don't want to
take my word for it, I'll give you
an example that actually
happened.

One day, I reached the ground
floor of the Cathedral at 9:25 a.m.
for a 9:30 a.m. Econ exam. Upon
arrival at the lecture room, I

, found about 10 classmates stand-

ing outside the closed doors,
reviewing their notes and
daydreaming. Naturally I as-
sumed these people had a very
good reason for not entering the
room. I sat down, leaned on the

wall and stared at the hallway.

Minutes passed, more Econ stu-
dents arrived and patiently wait-
ed outside the lecture room._No
one approached the doors. Soon
it was 9:40 a.m., and the now 25
waiting Econ students became
restless. A _

Finally someone asked the key

question: ”Why the hell are we»

standing here?” .
There was silence for a half a

minute when another person re-

plied quietly, ”Well, there is

another class in there.”

A voice quickly responded, ”I
thought, the doors were just
locked.”

Mouths dropped open and

people gazed at each other.. At a

 

MARC
nucl-Im

the same - moment, all of us
rushed to the lecture room doors.
We flung them open like an an-
gry mob to see half of our class,
who arrived at 9:15 a.m., busily
scribbling on their test papers.
Our professor looked up from his
desk in shock. We all groaned
and were too ashamed to ex-
plain. Each of us grabbed a test»
paper from the professor and
sluggishly took a seat.

The entire experience was like
a textbook psychology experi-
ment, and we reacted like typical.
rats. ,

It had nothing to_ do with our
intelligence, only the strength of
each one of us to think for him-
self in a pressure situation and
succeed when everyone else
fails. None of us were strong that
day. We succumbed to’ the
reasoning of the majority. Why?
All we had to do was open a
door. We were too weak to even
do that. ’

Our weakness to society is no
surprise. Only the greatest of men
have been strong enough‘ to
defeat it: Wolfgang Mozart,
Charles Darwin, Mohandas
Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Albert Einstein. These men strug-
gled against something that they

‘wanted to help. It is fortunate that
the strength of the individual out- -

lives the time of the society. .

Since we all can't be like Ein-'

stein, what can we do? How can

we become stronger? There are .

no barbells for your brain.
All I can say is that Econ exam

-experience made me a little

stronger. Hopefully, I can act a lit-

tle more independently if it ‘hap- '
"pens again.» ’

After all, making mistakes is
tougher than bench pressing 300

pounds

It's a nice chair,
but $1.1 million?

—We|l I'll be darned.

No sooner had my recent
column gone to press — the
column about Eddy G.
Nicholson, the man who
paid $1.1 million fora chair
— then who should callme
but Eddy G. Nicholson.

If you read the column,
you know that I had be-
come obsessed with Eddy
G. Nicholson. Last October
I read a newspaper article
about him; the article
reported that Nicholson
had purchased an 18th cen-
tury mahogany wing chair for $1.1'million during an auction
at Sotheby’s international auction house in New _York. That
made the chair the most expensive piece of furniture ever sold
in the United States. A A

I was filled with questions. Would Eddy G. Nicholson actu-

 

“ ally sit in the chair? Why would anyone pay‘$1 .1 million for

a chair? Where would he put the chair?
But for months I tried to reach Eddy G. Nicholson, and for
months he failed to return my calls. Finally I interviewed some

other people about him and wrote the column.

And then the phone rang. And it was Eddy G. Nicholson.

”I understand you've been trying to get hold of me,” he said.

I said that I certainly had. I was consumed by the idea of the
$1.1 million chair. I asked him where it was.

You're not going to believe this.

”It’s out being reupholstered,” Eddy G. Nicholson said.

I thought I was hearing him wrong.

”You paid $1.1 million for a chair and then you sent it out
to be reupho|stered?” I said.

”Yes,”_ Nicholson said.

”You thought the chair was worth $1.1 million, but you didn't
like the upholstery?” I said. a 57 ‘

‘ ”That’s correct,” Nicholson‘ said. ”The upholstery Idid‘ not l

feel was appropriate.”

”What was wrong with it?” I asked. ‘

”Well, for one thing, the chair was overstuffed,” Nicholson
said. ”The arms and seat were overstuffed.” » '

’’Did you at least like the fabric?” I said.

”Not really,” he said._”|’m having new fabric put on.”

This was getting confusing. The man had paid $1.1 million
for a chair, and then the first thing he had done was get it re--
done because he didn’t like the looks of it.

”The upholstery’s not the important thing,” Nicholson said.
”What is important is the structural part of the chair — the wood
and how it is put together." ~

He’ said the reupholstered chair is due to be delivered to his

house in New Hampshire by May 1;

' And then will he sit on it?
”Of course I'll sit on it,” he said. ”It was made to be sat on.”
And, if his friends come over, will they be allowed to sit on it?

”You bet,” Nicholson said. ”I do not put ‘Do Not Sit’ signs

on my chairs." .

He said that it would probably place the chair next to his tea
table. (Readers of the previous column will recall that Nichol-
son, in 1985, purchased a tea table for $1,045,000.)

I asked him if it didn't make him nervous to have a ‘

$1,045,000 tea table standing in the middle of his living room,

where someone could take a false step and trip over it.

”Well I certainly make sure that people don't put their cock-
tails down on it,” he said ”I run around with little coasters so
that doesn't happen.” .

And he isn't concerned that all of his friends will line up, wait-
ing their turn to sit in the $1.1 millionchair?

”Most people don't even know,” he said. ”I’m sure, that if

I don't point it out to them, they'll never realize that the chair I A

cost a million dollars.”

But doesn't that get to the point of all this? Doesn't he wonder I

what the average person thinks about a man who would pay
$1.1 million for a chair?

”I know some people probably would think it's crazy,”
Nicholson said. '

And that's OK with him?

”The chair is well worth the_price to me,” he said. ”On the I

day it arrives, I will mix myself a drink, sit down in the chair

and try to fantasize about who may have sat in it in the centu- _

ries before."

man in Dover, Paul Ovington.
”That is how the water rushed in
because there is no other hole in
the ship.”

Unofficial speculation focused
on the possibility that the huge
bow doors through which cars
and trucks are loaded onto the
ferry were left open after depar-
ture. Shipping officials in
Zeebrugge have said the doors
which normally are above the
waterline are sometimes left open
to "clear the area of exhaust
fumes.

Relatives of the missing, mean-
while, were taken by bus froma
municipal guesthouse to city hall
to check a passenger list, then es-
corted to the makeshift morgue at
Zeebrugge’s sports complex.

Officials said 22 bodies were
identified, but would not release
names or nationalities.

‘Some: relatives wept as they
were ushered through black cur-
tains to view the bodies. Several

George Lamy of London said
he had identified his mother, wife
and grandson in the morgue.

”We’re still looking for my
daughter and son-in-law,’’ he
said, his face pale and eyes wet.
”Maybe my daughter is some-

nalists at a distance, but one dis-

Reading said, ”Traveling
abroad is like making love, if
you've never done it, you may

‘ never miss it. But if you've had

the experience, you want it again

and again.”

Favorinni said that New York
demands you to do something,

Instead, he learned to let cultures

Holocaust survivor: ’l can’thurtanymore.’

By Matthew Thornton
Contributing Editor

For many, the Holocaust is a
subject occupying class -time,
much as any other subject. For
some, it is a subject chosen for a
lifetime of research.

For still others, it is simply a
haunting memory. Dora lwler is
one of those for whom the
Holocaust is a childhood
memory.

lwler spoke to a History 48
class on Thursday about her per-
sonal experience in Nazi-
occupied Poland.

While in Poland during the sec-
ond World War, she was forced
to hide from the Nazis, some-
times having to break out of con-
centration camps.

’’I worked in the fields,” she‘

said. ”Crematoriums. — they

never had those in the camp I

was in. in my camp, they killed
people in the open.”

Congress

WASHINGTON — Congress is
facing its first battle of the year
over aid to Nicaragua’s Contra re-
bels, a fight that also will provide
a measure of how well President

Reagan has regained his political‘

footing on Capitol Hill.
At stake this week is the final

. $40 million installment of the

$100 million aid package for the
anti—Sandinista fighters that Con-

_ gress passed last year.

Even if the Democrat-
controlled House and Senate
vote to block the $40 million pay-
ment, a Reagan veto could still
ensure that the Contras get the
funds. But lawmakers on both
sides of the emotional issue are

lwler spoke of memories of
bodies, naked and lifeless, piled
waist high:

’’I cannot be hurt anymore,”
she said. ”They took everything
but my pride. l cannot hurt
anymore.”

She said that if one person
were to adopt a more tolerant at-
titude as the result of hearing her,
she would feel that her pain had
been justified.

’’Please don't. hate. It's a
cancer,” she told the class. if you
see something you don't like,
speak up. Yesterday, it was me.
Tomorrow, God forbid, it could
be you.”

At the outset of the war, when
the Nazi's were beginning to
amass power, lwler was a
16-year-old living in a small town
in Poland. 1

When the Russians came to
Poland, she said her family

”We had enough to live com-
fortably,” she said. ”Like any.
other family — enough to get by,
but no more.” '

Then, the Russians left, to be
followed by the Nazis. First, they
got rid of the blacks and the
homosexuals. The Jews were
then concentrated into increas-
ingly smaller areas and systemat-
ically executed.

”Nobody knew till the last
month that it was going to be so
bad," lwler said. ”They only left
the people [who] could work,
that could be _of use to them.”

She was taken to the concen-
tration camp Janowski, in Lvov.
Until she was able to escape by
hiding in the weeds and escaping
from the Nazi guards, she was
forced to dig potatoes.

When Reagan formally re-
quested the final $4O million last
week, he also certified to Con-
gress that there was no reasona-
ble ' chance for a near-term
diplomatic settlement of the
region's problems without the
military aid to the rebels.
Democrats attacked that finding.
The assertion was a renewal of
the administration's stated aim of
a two-track solution: a multilater-

nations in the region, coupled
with continued military pressure
on Nicaragua to force its leftist

When the matter goes to the

Georgetown takes Big East titlefo r fifthti me  i

By John Enright

Sports Editor

NEW YORK -— The George-

» town Hoyas continued their

dominance of the Big East post-

season basketball tournament

with a 69-59 victory over Syra-

cuse in the championship game

at Madison Square Garden on
Sunday afternoon.

It was Georgetown’s fifth tour-
nament title win in the eight-year
history of the league.

The Hoyas (26-4) were led in
scoring by tournament MVP Reg-

 gie Williams. Williams had a
game-high 25 points, including

five three—point field goals.

”Reggie is a great player and
some of the three pointers he
made were hard,” said Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim.

The Orangemen (26-6) were
led by guard Sherman Douglas
with 20 points, while center Rony
Seikaly added 19 and forward
Howard Triche had 10.

Syracuse, just as they had the’

previous day against Pitt, came
out shooting well, and led early
in the game, 21-1 1. But aided by
a strong performance on the
boards and four three—point field
goals (three by Williams) Geor-
getown stormed back to take a

39-32 halftime lead.

The Hoyas out-rebounded
Syracuse 28-14 in the first half
and 47-30 for the game.

-’’In the first half, we were total-
ly dominated by them on the
boards,” said Boeheim ”We have

not been a good rebounding

team all year long.”

”We scrapped. We had to
overcompensate because Syra-
cuse is so big,” said Georgetown
coach John Thompson. The
Hoyas had four ‘players with
seven rebounds or more in the
game, led by Williams with nine.

In the second half, Syracuse
could get no closer than 42-40 on

two foul shots by Triche at the
16:53 mark. But Georgetown
responded with an 8-0 run and
controlled the rest of the game.

The Orangemen cut the Hoyas
lead to 63-59 with 2:28 left, but

Georgetown scored the games

last six points,‘ capped off by a
Williams’ slam dunk at the
buzzen
7 Boeheim felt Georgetown’s
tough zone defense may have
been the difference.
”Georgetown is playing as well
defensively as any team I've seen.
They did a good job taking Greg
[Monroe] out of his game,” said
Boeheim.

Monday, March 9, I98

Monroe, who didn't score in
the first half and finished the

game with only two points, had _ is

scored 20 points and made five
three—point field goals against Pitt.

Syracuse shot only 41 percent  

from the field in the gameafter

shooting 77 percent against the 

Panthers. ._ .
The Orangemen got some 
good news hours after the game, ‘J ’ -

NEW YORK —' Pearl who?

Last year Dwayne (The
Pearl) Washington, Syracuse's
star point guard for three sea-
sons, left school for the NBA.
A huge void was left to fill in
the Orangemen line-up.

But the loss of The Pearl has
helped this Syracuse team —
not hurt them — because his
replacement, Sherman Doug-
las, may just be better.

That's what Syracuse basket-
ball fans have known all sea-
son long. And now — after
Saturday's 99-85 Orangemen
victory over Pitt in the semi-
final round of the Big East tour-
nament at ‘Madison Square
Garden —— the Panthers are be-
lievers also.

The 6-1 Douglas scored a
tournament record 35 points

lead the Orangemen past Pitt
and into the championship
game against Georgetown.

3 ”As a team Syracuse is
tremendously improved with
Douglas,” said Pitt coach Paul
Evans.

The Panthers" (24-7) got into
the semi-final round with their
first Big East tournament win
ever — a 96-88 decision over
Seton Hall on Friday af-
ternoon.

. McRae takes second at World Indoor games

By Bert Rosenthal
AP Track Writer

INDIANAPOLIS — Lee McRae
of the United States, the only
sprinter to beat Canadian Ben
Johnson in 60-meter dash indoors
in 1986-87, finished second to
Johnson in 6.50, breaking the
American record of 6.54, Satur-
day in the ‘World Indoor Cham-
pionships before a Hoosier
Dome crowd of 20,023.

It wasthe largest crowd ever to

' watch an sindoorjhtrack, and field

 

 $Ptiht,records- T.he~-l9Dg~striding,

 

meet.

McRae is currently sizzling the
track world as a top sprinter at the
University of Pittsburgh. ‘

The old American record was
set by Houston McTear in 1978.

Johnson, the world's top-
ranked men's 100-meter runner
— a position that goes with the
title ”world’s fastest human” —
won the men's 60-meter dash in
a world record 6.41.

East German Heike Drechsler
and Johnson raced to consecutive

      

22-year-old Drechsler completed
a double by winning the wom-

‘en's 200—meter dash in a world-

record 22.27 seconds, after hav-
ing won the long jump earlier at
23 feet, 3 inches.

A third world indoor record
was broken in
5,000—meter walk by Mikhail
Schennikov of the Soviet Union,
who was timed in 18:27.79.

Drechsler and Johnson were
the real crowd-pleasers. ‘

The 5-11 East German, who

,owns_th.e (world indoor and. out-

 

 

the men's‘

       

door records in the long jump
and shares the world outdoor
record in the 200, began her

sweep of the two events by cap- s

turing the jump.
She established a big early lead
and won handily, breaking the
record of 22.39 set by her coun-
trywoman, Marita Koch, in 1983.
Drechsler and Koch, who re-
tired this year, share the world
outdoor record of 21.71, a time
which Drechsler ran twice l_ast

Here are some conclusions I
drew from watching the Big East
Championship:

0 The best team in the confer-
ence won the tournament.

That is an easy statement to
make, since that is usually the
way it works. But that team,
Georgetown, did not win the
regular season title outright.

' When Pitt lost at St. John's in
the regular season finale, it lost
sole possession of first place and

‘ received the second seed in this

past‘ weekend's tournament.
Georgetown was seeded first by
right of its two wins over both Pitt
and Syracuse.

Deservedly so.

Georgetown was the best team
in the conference this past year.

again carry the tournament's first-

place trophy out of Madison
Square Garden.

No team in the conference
plays defense as tough as Geor-
getown, nor, it seems, does any
team want to win- as bad.

The Hoyas are good.

0 The CBS sports broadcasting
team of Brent Musberger and
Billy Packer is lousy. '

They both came to some mar-
velous deductions during their
network's coverage of the semi-
final and championship games.

It started during the Pitt-

Syracuse game on Saturday when

Musberger pointed out that
perhaps Syracuse is a much bet-
ter team with Sherman Douglas

at point guard instead of Dwayne-
‘Washington.

Good point, fellas!
When you take into consider-

 

   
   

W‘
-.
. 
. [-

 _ '1  ..__‘
ation Syracuse's season record

(26-5) and its top-10 ranking —
that should lead you to some_kind
of conclusion right away. Then
consider that Douglas is close to
a 20 points per game scorer and
Syracuse's leading assist man.

THE PITT NEWTS, Monday, March 9, 1987

I'm just glad that Musberger

and Packer pointed that out. I

' would have never realized it_._’

Another great observation
Packer made was when he said

"-2 that the point guard position has
i been a problem for Pitt and
' Coach Paul Evans all season.

He was referring to Mike
Goodson, who played badly for
about a three—game stretch this
season but since has figured
strongly in Pitt's successes.

The comment came after

Goodson was called for traveling
in the first half.

I think the last time Packer
watched a Big East team play was
when Patrick Ewing was still at
Georgetown.

The trouble spot for Pitt has
been off-guard.

Reflections of things past: The Big East title

Maybe Musberger should stick
with football. Maybe Packer — if
he is going to act like he knows
what is going on —-— should be a
little better prepared next time.

0 The Big East may suffer in
the NCAA tournament.

The teams that are successful in
the NCAA are the ones who are

‘peaking. Georgetown seems to

be cruising '— they will definite-
ly go far.

The rest of the field is unclear.
Providence does not have the
front line to survive, and Syracuse
does not have the coach to
survive. \

Pitt has a strong inside game,
but that means nothing if you
don't have anyone who can hit
from the perimeter.

Georgetown is a contender —-
the rest are pretenders.

BASKETBALL
ANALYSIS

If the Running Rebels are going
to make it to the Final Four in
New Orleans, they are going to
have to play as consistent defen-
sively as they do offensively.

0 The North Carolina Tar
Heels (27-2) are ranked 2nd in
the nation and are also going to
be very tough contenders.

The team is led by All Ameri-
can Kenny Smith, Joe Wolf, Jeff
Lebo and the freshman sensation
J.R. Reid. The coach is the legen-
dary Dean Smith.

Smith has a career record of
606-173 and tends to play tough

' defense, run a structured offense

and just plain win. ,

Some experts believe the
bench strength of the Tar Heels
is the best in the country, and this
could prove to be an important
factor. J

0 The Purdue Boilermakers
(23-3) have been a big surprise
this season in the Big Ten. Coach
Gene Keady has landed himself
a goldmine in Troy Lewis who is_
one of the best outside shooters
in the nation as well as Todd
Mitchell who gives the team
much needed inside strength.

Purdue's main problem seems
to be the absence of a true center.
But if 6-9 sophomore Melvin
Mcants continues to play well on

the offensive and defensive,

boards, Purdue could be a seri-
ous contender.

O Ranked 4th in the nation are
the Indiana Hoosiers (23-4). They
are led by perhaps the best shoot-
ing guard in the country — All
American Steve Alford, who has
recently become the all-time
leading scorer at the school.

This season, the Hoosiers have
displayed a powerful inside
game, unlike past years. The out-

SA TISFA CTTON GUARANTEED

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 9, 1987

‘: standing play of Daryl Thomas
and Ricky Calloway have helped J

Indiana control the offensive and

defensive boards consistently.
Indiana also possesses one of

the best teachers-of-the-game in

. Bobby Knight. Knight has already

won two national championships
in 1976 and 1981 and has a
career coaching record of
336-115. J,

The Hoosiers must rely on the
outside shooting of Alford. They
are very quick and play a tena-
cious man-to-man defense — one
of Knight's trademarks.

0 Depaul (25-2) is another sur-
prise team this season. The only
losses . they've suffered have
come from Georgetown and
Notre Dame.

The Blue Demons are led by
Dallas Comegys and Rod Strick-
land. They have also been helped
by the outstanding play of junior
college transfer Kevin Edwards.

Depaul is coached by Joey
Meyer, who‘took over for his
father Ray Meyer just three years
ago. For Depaul to win they must
play good defense and create op-
portunities for Comegys and
Strickland.

0 Iowa (25-4) well deserves
their number 6 ranking. First year
coach Tom Davis has done a
remarkable job rebuilding the
Hawkeyes from last season's dis-
asterous 6th place finish in the
Big Ten. -

Iowa is led by forward Roy
Marble, who compares himself to
Michael Jordan. The Hawkeyes
have also gotten strong play from
B.J. Armstrong, Al ”Vanilla Goril-
la” Lorenzen and Gerry ”Sir
Jamalot” Wright.

The Hawkeyes are quick. They
apply full—court pressure on
defense and like to penetrate in-
side on offense. They also, like

_North Carolina, have a very

strong bench.

I 0 The Georgetown Hoyas
(23-4) are ranked 7th in the coun-
try and are always a threat to win

. — especially with the strong

presence of All-American Reggie
Williams.

Williams has_ had an outstand-
ing season and should receive the
Big East Player of the Year Award.

The Hoyas have also gotten
surprisingly great support from
Ronnie Highsmith, Perry
McDonald and freshman Mark
Tillman. Coach John Thompson,
recently named Big East Coach of
the Year 321-115, likes to play
his entire team and wear the
oppenents down with a trapping
full—court press.

Georgetown is disciplined and
very quick. They reiy very heavi-
ly on the outside shooting of Wil-
liams. To stop the Hoyas you

The NCAASZ a toss-up for the good teams

must break their full-court press,
make them play your tempo, and
most importantly shut down Reg-
gie Williams.

- The 8th ranked Temple Owls
(29-3) have played outstanding
basketball all year long. Led by
Atlantic Ten Player of the Year,
Nate Blackwell, the Owls have
really come into their own this
season. Tim Perry, Howard
Evans,,Ramon Rivas and fresh-
man Mike Vreesayk have also
contributed greatly to the success
of the team.

Temple's coach John Chaney
(12 7-35) has literally put the Tem-
ple program on the map. His
teams are quick, well disciplined
and strong. ’

On the inside, the team is
strong. However, Temple doesn't
have a strong bench, and this
could be an important factor.

0 To no 'one’s surprise, the play
of the 9th ranked Alabama Crim-
son Tide (23-4) has been very
consistent. ,

The Tide is led by center Der-
rick McKey. McKey is very agile
for a 6-9 center and shoots ex-
tremely well from the outside —
just as well as he rebounds on the
inside. Jim Farmer, Terry Coner
and senior guard Mark Gottfried
have all played very consistently
this season. Coach Wimp Sander-
son (127—61) likes his team to run
the fast break and play tough
defense.

0 Ranked 10th, depending on
what poll is checked, either Syra-
cuse (24-5) or Pittsburgh (23-6)
will be found.

Paul Evans hasdone a remark-
able job rebuilding the struggling
Pitt team. He has employed dis-
cipline, teamwork and confi-
dence in rejuvenating the
Panthers.

Led by center Charles Smith
and power forward Jerome Lane,
who leads the nation in rebound-
ing, Pitt has attained their high
ranking in the Big East. Mike
Goodson has done a great job at
the point, while Curtis Aiken and
freshman Rodney Brookin have
found the range from the outside.

The Panthers play a tough
match-up zone defense and use
a combination of outside shoot-
ing and inside rebounding on the
offensive end.

On the other hand, the Orange-

(men have also played very well

this season.

Jim Boehiem’s (230-77) team is
led by 6-10 center Rony Seikaly
and four-time Big East Freshman
of the Week Derrick Coleman.
The Orangemen have also had
great efforts from sophomore
Sherman Douglas and -seniors
Howard Triche and Greg
Monroe.

Freshmangymnast Pollaci learning the ropes

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

Untimely injuries to key mem-
bers of the Pitt gymnastics team
have made it hard for Coach
_Frank D’Amico to find a good
chemistry for his team this year.
One of the elements that will
help keep the program strong in

« coming years is freshman Pat Pol-
laci from Patchogue-Medford
High School in Long Island.

Pollaci’s interest in gymnsatics
began when he was in first grade,
but his desire to stay in the sport
fluctuated until his sophomore
year in high school when he met
his two biggest influences in the
sport.

The two men were coaches for
his team, and they gave him an
attitude about the sport he still
carries. His head coach at the
time was Chuck LaCombe.

”It wasn't until I was in 10th
grade that I started getting serious
about it,” Pollaci said.

”When I was a sophomore, I
quit gymnastics for about four
months. I just wasn't into it any-
more. Then Chuck called me up
and told me he had just started a '
new program at the gym, and he
asked me if I was still interested
in gymnastics.

”He taught me so much and

got me pretty much where I am

right now.”

While LaCombe was showing
the basics of gymnastics to him,
the assistant coach, Roger Burke,
was the force that kept his desire
and ‘love for the sport alive.
"Roger Burke was a really big fac-
tor on getting me where I am.
He's a motivator,” Pollaci said.

Pollaci is planning on majoring
in mechanical engineering, and

he said he made the decision to -

come to Pitt after examining both
the academic and athletic pro-
grams the school had to offer. He
said, ”Pitt- has a good engineer-
ing program, and the gymnastics
program is good. Plus I already
knew some of the guys on the
team.”

Pollaci has been living with
teammate Jorge Gonzalez for
over two years, and he said their
relationship is beneficial to his
performance in meets. While
some find problems living and
training with the same person,
Pollaci has had no problems at
all

”It’s not a rivalry, but. more of \_
a friendship where we push each

other,” he said. ”_When he does
good, it makes me want to do
good and vice versa. But we've
both accomplished pretty much
the samething.”

Pollaci feels the team support
is a definite bonus. He said,
”When you hear people behind
you cheering before you go do
your routine that helps tremen-
dous|y.”

Among the routines Pollaci is
required to do, he finds the floor
exercises the easiest, but he gets
the most pleasure from compet-
ing on the high bar.

He said he relaxes more during
his floor routine and finds it an
easier event because of that. ”Not
as far as doing tricks, but doing
a routine,” he said. ”It’s an event
where you can take your time.”

Between the ease of the floor
exercise and the enjoyment of the
high. bar, he finds difficulty ‘in
work on the pommel horse. He
said the event is more difficult be-
cause he hadn't done much in
the eventuntil he met LaCombe
and Burke in high school, and he
will need more practice to be-
come comfortable.

In the meantime he finds him-
self looking forward to the high
bar. at the conclusion of each
meet. ‘

it’s the most exciting event.

”The competitiveness of gym- -
is much harder in ’

nastics
coHege/’
In the remaining three years of
his gymnastics career at Pitt, Pol-
laci hopes to find himself among
the elite gymnasts in the country.
”One of my main goals is to
make -NCAA nationals my junior

and senior years,” he said. ”Also, .

I would like to make the USA
Championships.”

Until that time he said he will
work on the basics of the sport

‘with Coach D’Amico and learn as

much as he can.

”The goal I have going into a
meet is to hit every routine and
to be consistent,” he said. ’’I have
faith that Frank can guide me to
reach my future goals.

To find the most exciting mo-
ment in his young career, Polla-
ci thought back to the days he
competed in high school.

”During the high school state
meet I took second in the all-
around and scored a 52.1, which
was the highest I had ever scored.
I also took first on the floor at that

- meet,” Pollaci said.

THE. PITI' NEWS, Monday, March 9, 1937

Wrestlers unhappy withscores  

IL

attained at meet over weekend

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Panther
wrestling team, who this season
showed winning potential and ta-
lent, suffered a casualty this past
weekend at the Eastern Wrestling
League tournament. Instead of
emerging victorious, the Panther
team only placed fifth.

’’I have mixed emotions about
the weekend,” said Pitt head
coach Rande Stottlemyer. ”On
Friday the guys came out and
wrestled really tough. But on
Saturday the intensity wasn't
there. We didn't perform as well
as we could have."

In the 118-pound match, Pitt's
Matt Rizzo placed fifth, and at
126, Matt Gerhard finished
fourth. And even though he wres-
tled in a relatively tough match,
normally victorious Alan Utter

_ couldn't place at all at 134.

’’Alan had to face the eventual
champion in his first match [Tim

00

  

Flynn from Penn State],” said
Stottlemyer. ”It was a great match
from the start. Alan was all over
him, and it ended up tied at 8-8.

Then in the overtime, Flynn end--

ed up beating him 7 .”

Pitt's Pat Santoro won the
championship in the 142 class by
beating Dave Wlodarz. In a
strange bit of circumstance, this
was the only match he wrestled
in at the tournament.

”Pat got a bye in the first
round,” Stottlemyer said. ”Then
for some reason the West Virginia
coach forfeited the next round. It
was hard on Pat because he only
fought in that one match over the
whole weekend.”

Santoro won the match 10-3.

”He looked good, but. not '

great,” said Stottlemyer. ”142 is
probably the toughest division in
the league, but Pat's win was still
by the biggest margin of all the
championship matches."

At 150, Pitt's Gary Bolin ‘made
it to the championship match, but

lost 3-2 to Sean Finkbeiner of
Penn State. This placed him in
the second slot, this placement
did qualify him for the national
championship rankings.

Eric Wertz was the only other
Pitt wrestler to make it to the fi-
nal round. He fought tough but
couldn’tpull off the win and lost
8-5 to Ken Haselrig of Clarion.
This placed Wertz second in-
dividually in the entire tour-

, nament.

”Throughout the season we
called these three guys ’The
Wall,’ ” said Stottlemyer. ”Basi-
cally, they performed just as well

this weekend as they have for the '

entire season.”

The only other Pitt wrestler
who made the tournament rank-
ings was Mike Tongel in the 167
group. In this, he finished fifth.

’’I’m really proud of the show-
ing that our guys gave," said
Stottlemyer. ”But I'm a little dis-

Associated Press Writer

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The
chief of enforcement for the
NCAA said Saturday that there
was no hope for integrity in
college athletics if Texas

cal of those in charge.

Clements, head of the
Southern Methodist Universi-
ty board of governors until he
became governor of the state,
admitted last week that he and
some board members were
aware of illicit payments to
football players and had
authorized the payments to be
continued after they assured
the NCAA the practice had
stopped.

David Berst, enforcement
chief for the National Collegi-
ate Athletic Association, said
in an interview that the state-
ment was ”a real shocker.”

Texas governor is
tainted by SMU

Governor Bill Clements is typi— _

”If he's typical of people
who are in charge at the
highest level, then there real-
ly isn't any hope for integrity
incollegiate athletics,” Berst
said. ”I’m optimistic enough
to believe the SMU situation is
not typical. But it certainly is
most discouraging.”

SMU, the most penalized
school in college history, last _
month became the first to ,
receive the ”death penalty" as
a repeat violator. '

The Mustang football pro-
gram, again found guilty of im-
proper payments to athletes,
was suspended for 1987, res- .

tricted to seven road games , 7

next year and hit with other
penalties lasting into 1990'.

Clements resigned fromthe
SMU board of governors after
he was elected governor last -
