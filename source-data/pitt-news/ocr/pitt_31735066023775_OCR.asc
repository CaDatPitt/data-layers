AAUP Delays on
Union Issue,

*3

By LINDA MILLER
The Pill News Staff Writer
The decision whether to seek the
role of sole bargaining agent either
alone or in conjunction with Pitt
Professional Union has been
deferred for_ one year by Pitt’s
chapter of the American Asso-
iation of University Professors
(AAUP).

‘ The resolution calling for the one
year deferral passed by a formal
vote of eight to four after much
discussion among the 25 AAUP
‘qgimembers and guests present at the
M Jan. 23 meeting.

Dr. Richard Thorn, AAUP
chapter president, disputed refer-
ences to the resolution as a delay,
saying that there “has to be time to
talk about alternative models”_ to
collective bargaining.

One alternative discussed at
length was collegial governance.

“The "University has not made“

good on collegiality,” Thorn said..
“Academic ofﬁces have become
budget ofﬁces, discussing very
little academic policy, which is very
disturbing.”

While the AAUP believes that

the faculty must assume ﬁscal
responsibility on its" part, they also
believe there should be no need to
discuss the introduction of aca-
demic priorities into ﬁscal de-
cisions.

Instead, AAUP Dronoses that
with collegial governance,
faculty, through its chairmen,
deans, and senate would set the

"academic policies and priorities of
the University which the budget
would serve. P - '

David Tive, executive secretary
of the state AAUP, stressed the
impact that a united faculty could
have on the state legistature,
particularly since both Temple and
Lincoln (state-related-schools) have
chosen AAUP as their collective
bargaining agent. .

He also noted the urgency of
sucha move, pointing out the fact
that Gov. Thornburgh is alloting a
fundinglincrease of only 3.5 to 4

A percent for state-related schools

 

and possible problems with ,Penn- V

sylvania Higher Education Assis-
tance Agency. '

Pitt continues to be the third-
most expensive public college in
the nation with a total tuition of
$1,846 for most residents and-
$2,008 for room and board.

Pitt’s standing is based on
-results from an annual survey
conducted by the National Associa-
tion of State Universities and Land
Grant Colleges (NASULGC), an
education association representing.
the principal public universities,
seeking to focus public attention on
» problems of this segment of higher
education, including cost trends. -

In the NASULGC survey of 165»
schools, Pitt" fell‘ behind only
Temple University in Philadelphia,
which ranked second, and Camell-

In the beginning’ there was the
Pittsburgh Academy. And then, by
an almighty act of the Pennsyl--
vania General Assembly in 1819,
there became the Western Univer-

two private institutions included in

‘ the tabulation.

Jack Freemen, senior vice
chancellor of administration, said

the reason Pitt’s tuition is so high is V"

because the state’s appropriations
have been “inadaquate”, increas-
ing less than ﬁve percent. ‘ , 4 -
“We’ve tried ' to hold‘ costs"
down, and made major efforts to
cut back on costs,” Freemen said.
_ “The budgetonly increased ‘seven
percent in 1980 and we were able to
hold to a reasonable salary increase
of 10 percent. ‘ -
“We try to hold costs down, but
_if the state’s appropriations aren't
5 enough, then we haveno choice but
to cut back or raise tuition, and

AD W0 D

_. state to supplement Pitt’s annual

'1 budget. And this year's appropria-
7-”tion,si process, like the other 12, will

‘ not be without the usual political

* -in-ﬁghting, legislative complica-

sity of Pennsylvania. And in 1908 it- _

was decreed that there should be
the University of Pittsburgh..

But, in 1966 there was a plague,
a ﬁnancial plague, and on July 28
of that .year, Pitt mended its

kl’

wastefulways and beseeched the *

commonwealth for forgiveness.
From this- day on there became
what is known-as the University of
Pittsburgh- of the Commonwealth
System of Higher Education.

And, from this day on, there .

became what is known as the
“appropriations process,” and it
will be in a matter of days when the
process will continue. ‘
The appropriations process for

\'%

tions, and so-called. ‘fhostage
taking”~ by legislators intent on
holding appropriations until. their
‘own legislation is, passed.

Other factors including declining
enrollments, cuts in federal reve-
nue-sharing to the state, a
reluctance to raise.taxes, and ever
increasing inﬂationary costs" will
also play a.- deciding role in the
amount of funds Pitt will receive

' from the state; and, of importance
‘to students, how much tuition will
rise. .
This year Pitt will ask the state
for $83,994,700 in commonwealth
‘support, an increase of approxi-
',mately $13 million or 18.2 percent
'9 over -last -.year’s appropriation of
‘$71.1 million.‘ ' '

The Pitt News Stall’ Writer

Abortion is thought by some to
be: the only service provided by
women’s health clir’ *2, yet these
JS in the
Pittsburgh area offs- a variety of
much needed servf c to women of
all ages and incomc levels.

Mary Ellen Tunney, director of
education of Women’s Health
Services, said that in addition to
free pregnancy testing, pregnancy
test counseling and ﬁrst-trimester
abortions, the clinic offers relation-
ship and in-depth counseling,
contraceptive and gynecological
care, sexuality therapy, venereal
disease testing, treatment, and a
new program‘for menopausal
women.

“We’re a large non-profit
organization. We were thex ﬁrst
facility of this .type to open in the
tri-state area,” Tunney said.
“Since we opened in 1973, we have
seen over 70,000 women who have
come here seeking abortion ser-
vices and about 110,000 women for
other services such as straight
counseling, and gynecological and
contraceptive services. ’ ’

Claire Keyes, director of Alle-
gheny Reproductive Health Center,
said the center is a private,
non-profit agency providing free
pregnancy testing, abortion ser-
vices, birth control information,
and personal and abortion-related
counseling.

“We do not offer prenatal care,
but we will refer a woman to a
private doctor or clinic,'.’ Keyes
said.

Jeanne Clark, director of Alle-
gheny Women’s Center said, “We
are primarily a first-trimester

abortion clinic, but we also offer
individual counseling and group
information sessions around the
issue of problem pregnancy and
abortion or carrying the pregnancy
to term.

Jean Wallace, a pre—med student
at Pitt, said she called these
services to check the validity of
their advertisements which offer
“pregnancy counseling” and make
offers for women to “leam how
your body works.”

Wallace said the pregnancy
counselor to whom she spoke knew
very little about fetal development,
but eagerly offered abortion
information.

“Misleading advertising is ob-
jectionable in all ﬁelds,” she said,
“ but Iﬁnd it extremely unsettling

when health services stoop to
advertising services they can not
provide, in order to bring in more
business.” ’

Tunney ‘maintained that ‘ Wo-

provide all services which are
advertised.

“Our counselors and nurses are
knowledgeable not only in abortion
information, but also prenatal care,
medical assistance and fetal
development, among other things.
Even the clerical workers in the
phone rooms were replaced by
nurses and counselors in order to
provide more professional advice to
women seeking advice over the
phone,” she said.

“If a woman seems ambivalent,

',then we won’t do the abortion,”

Tunney said. “We refer her to one
of our professional counselors who
can spend timewith her, working
with her feelings, helping her to
resolve exactly what she wants to

“The whole philosophy of the
movement we see ourselves in is
that we believe very strongly that
‘what we’re advocating is choice
and not abortion. We’re here to be
supportive of a pregnant woman
regardless of how she decides to
handle . that pregnancy,” Tunney
explained.

All three clinics will perform two
types of out-patient trimester
abortions. The ﬁrst, called early
abortion or menstrual extraction,
which means withdrawing the
lining of the uterus, is performed
up to 14-17 days after the woman's
last normal menstrual period at the
cost of $140.00-$190.00. . 

The second type, vacuum aspira-
tion will be performed up to 12-14
weeks after the woman’s last
normal menstrual period _at the cost
of $175.00-$190.00. .

In-patient abortions are per-
formed up to 20 weeks at

...'.é

Magee-Women’s Hospital and
West Penn Hospital. In-patient
abortions can actually be per-
formed up to 24 weeks, said Keyes,
but not in Pittsburgh. Beyond 20
weeks, a woman would have to go
to New York, she said.
 

“The whole philosophy of
the movement we see our-
selves in is that we believe
very strongly that what
we’re advocating is choice
and not abortion. We’re
here to be supportive of a
pregnant woman regard-
less of how she decides to
handle that pregnancy.”

 

The Pa. General Assembly
passed legislation effective Feb.
10, 1981, cutting off all medical
assistance for abortions.

“In the past, when the General
Assembly passed this kind of
legislation, we were always able to
get a court order to stop them on

the grounds that it was unconstitu- ‘

a violation of equal

tional,
protection under the law,’
Tunney. . . A V ‘“ ~

Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled lastsummer that there

was nothing in the Constitution“

that required any state to pay for
medical assistance abortions, and
that it was up to each individual
state to decide. So the Pa. General

“What’s going to happen after

evidence for its necessity.

AA UP

AAUP member Lenord Plotniclv
gave “ineffectualness” as his
principle reason for not favoring
the AAUP chapter resolution.

“Either we don‘t know what we
want to do or don't have the
courage to do what we want,"
Plotniclv said. “We must come out
on one side of the fence.”

Another AAUP member dis-
agreed, adding that by coming
down on one side of the fence too
early would split the already
divided AAUP chapter.

Appropriations

inflationary rate),” Freernah said.

According to the President’s
Statement, “From FY 1974through
FY 1980, inﬂation grew by over 66
percent while commonwealth fund-
ing increased only 41 percent.” In
other words, there has been a
difference of 25 percent between
the rise in state appropriations to
Pitt and the rise in the inﬂation
rate. ‘ .

To compensate for the ﬁnancial
constraints imposed by inﬂation,

There were several reasons
given for the division in the local
AAUP chapter.

One reason was Pitt's AAUP
chapter has been relatively inactive
for the past three years in the area
of goverance, causing a decline in
membership. Currently there are
close to 150 active members in the
AAUP chapter.

It was also noted that the
creation of a collective bargaining
unit with the Pitt Profesional Union

(PPU), an affiliate of the AFL-CIO,
would divide the AAUP chapter,
which has members in all units of
the University, into two groups.
Only one group, the Provost's unit,
would be represented. This unit
includes:CAS; GSPIA; the schools
of Social Work, Education, Busi-
ness, and Engineering; and branch
campuses.

Compounding this matter further
is the fact that the Provost area
members of the AAUP chapter are

continued from page one

divided‘on the issue of collective
bargaining.

An AAUP member suggested
that their organization “must be
structured before a process can
function or be iniated.”

Philip Wion, a representative of

the PPU, disagreed, saying that
“leadership must make-up its mind
and start the process.” -
The meeting was concluded with
emphasisbeing placed on strength-

ening and raising the awareness of

Pitt's AAUP membership.

Pitt has taken a number of steps,
two of which are listed as
assumptions in the President's
Statement: internal reallocation of
resources, and the improvement
in the efﬁciency of its administra-
tive operations.

The chief method of “internal
reallocation of resources” has been
achieved through the enactment of
a formal program called the
“Priority Fund,” Freeman said.
Every year the university will

reduce budgets throughout “virtu-
ally all units” of the university to
generate a pool of funds totalling
approximately $3,000,000 a year.
And from that pool, Pitt funds new
programs, mandated increases
such as utilities, and “other cost
increases that are una-vo‘id'able.”

school and the College of Arts and

program funded entirely out of the

Administrative operations have
been streamlined by the cutting of
certain services and a “greater use
of technology,” Freeman ex-
plained.

But, Freeman cautioned, the
administration will see cuts before
the academic side of the university:
“...we have typically tried to dig in
more deeply into the administrative
side of the house than into the
academic side.”

When all the assumptions are
summed up, they are contingent on
one thing: Pitt receiving the
amount of appropriations it re-
quested.

So, assuming that Pitt does not -

receive the amount requested what
will happen? —

“...then a substantial share of
the shortfall is going to have to be
passed onto students in\the form of
costs,” Freeman said.

“The request here is to make it
clear to the state that in order to
avoid escalating tuition further,
they’re going th have to give us
substantially more money, an 18
percent increase to be speciﬁc...to
the extent that the state fails to do
that, it will inevitably result in
some increase in tuition...This is a
very tight budget, we have already

cut our programs about as tightly’

as we can, we’re very prudent in
meeting mandated increases,”
Freeman said» ‘

Editors Note: This is the first
of a three-part series on the
issues affecting disabled
persons. In an effort to
increase public awareness
about the needs of disabled
persons, the United Nations
Council has declared 1981 the
International Year of the
Disabled Person. ln the next
three issues, we will examine
issues, needs, and
concerns of disabled people,
especially those of disabled
students.

There isa poster in Tom Galante’s
office. It says, “Label jars, . . . not

Galante’s attitude toward his job-as
director of Disabled Student
Services.

Galanate has been helping
disabled».Pitt students with their
particular problems since 1974 _in,a
job he origina-ted. Galante ‘knows’

',about. the problems" disabled
‘students can encounter becausehe,

himself, has been blind since birthgf

“l idon‘t-think about being blind
all the time, but being blind" effects
1 every corner ofmy life. People think
you understand all kinds ‘of
handicaps. But there are so many
specific kinds of problems. We give
very individualized service and it
needs to be that way,” Galante said.

lt is with this knowledge--that
disabled people do have unique

problems, butthey are as varied as '
individuals themselves--that

the
Galante runs his office.

His main goal is to develop‘
independence in students.

' U:S. Counc_il. ‘Former Pitt student,‘
.- pavid‘Engel, "was appointed bythe
commissioners to head the local pro-

ject. Engel had previously been
employed in another county pro-
gram and has been involved with
various causes for the handicapped
for a number of years. ‘
Engel is" entlhiisiastic about the
strong support coming from the

county level arid credits the commis— .

“I don’t want to provide services

. but bv what he can’t do.  '

Often in such a large school as
Pitt, this can be invaluablehelp.

“Its easy to get lost-here."Galante

' said.

When Galante came to Pitt as a
student in I971 from his hometown
of Philadelphia, there was no office
like his where he could go. Still,
Pitt's size was a main factor in his
coming here.

“In high school I was the only
handicapped student. I was the
center of attention. But l got too

 much attention. I wanted to go to a

big school__because I felt the need to

get lost, so to speak,“ said Galante.

During his four years as a student
Galante lived in the dorms.

“I had a really good time here. I
grew up as a person," he said.

_Life was as normal as possible.
Galante recalls that some people in
the dorms were horrified to hearthat
others were playing practical jokes
on him.

“They were just typical dorm
tricks. People just didn't understand
the dynamics. But my friends would

help me .when I wanted it." It's not‘

really .how- other people handle your
handicap, it‘s how you handle it,"he
noted. I . ' *

One‘ senses immediately that Tom
Gala-ntehas a good handle on life.
When he" graduated, intending to go
on- the. graduate shcool in social.
work,’ he was offered the job in
Special Student Services. Galante

. had worked with disabled veterans,
and knew there was a need for some
kind of office for handicapped
students.

“At first I just went around and
talked" to students, asking them what
they wanted and needed,“ he said.

-‘The two major problems
handicapped people face, according

anyone else , but we_live in-an.ethno-
egocentric society which stresses the.

differences rather than similarities in
’ people. - '
He believes that the program will’ ‘

is identiﬁed not by what hecan ‘do,
4 H A “Take, for jinstanceigsomeone
‘who is a computer pro'gram'mer‘.'We-
don‘t look at the fact thatghe hasthis‘
ability. Hemay be the bestinthe

city, but ‘yet we identify him‘

p_rimarily by his handicap."

The theme of partnership is cen-
tral to the issue of the international
year. Through ‘a partnership of dis-
abled individuals and other com-
munity members, an increased
awareness will be established. Inter-
action with the mainstream of
society isessential for. fostering a
sense of independence in the ‘dis-

. abled _in‘div_idual»and.it. is the pro- 7

grarrisintention to develop ‘cultural, A
educational and recreational pro-

_ jects which further the ideas of p'a‘r_t-_ _
' nership and integration. . . A

1 ’_/lndepeniience is _- an iniporta'i'it_

issue with Engel, also." .

“What happens to you: if you one
day fall of a cliff and wind up as a
quadrapalegic with three kids to

support? Where do you live? HOW

do you work?"

i , Housing and employment are two
, of the more obvious problems facing
the disabled at the present time.

' Allegheny County hasran‘ 8,000 unit

deficit in suitablehousing for the

. Mainstreaming is underway. Pub_lic‘_
, , awarenesssjr of the  situation; iiss,
handicapped and the only pgublic - ’ W ‘

to Galante. are that people tend to,
think of them as helpless and fragile,
or as some kind of superperson. _ .
Galante‘s philosphy is one of self ‘~
strength and reliance. V ’
“Often things get out of hand
because handicapped students let '
them get out of hand. If you handle
it well other people will,“ he said.

It is obvious that Galante enjoys
working with people. . And he notes‘~ ’
that he likes dealing with people's
reactions to his blindness. He has
found that most people handle it
well. «

“Sometimes you do feel angry,”
he said. “But that's reasonable.
There are certain things you cannot .
do, but you don't wear that anger on
your sleeve-it doesn't do anything
about your blindness.

“I remember in high school when
everybody°started to drive. I felt’
very isolated and angry," he said-

Of the approximately ‘ I00
students who go through Galante-‘s
office, about 50 see him regularly.’

Some handicapped students don't"
use the services offered. Like. _ p_
Galante did, they want to get lost; _  ‘_~ 5

’ “The disadvantage ‘is that some

' _really do get lost. But many would2:-’5"~t-‘Ki.

do ﬁne without this office,“ he ‘said.’-5.. 
“Where you really make the -A
difference is with the student whoiis
struggling-on the borderline.“ ‘

Galante was never reallyion the’  T :_.
borderline. He adjusted well to life l:,‘i_.~’
at Pitt. and Pittsburgh; a ‘city he‘ 
loves because of its symphony and ‘T5 
museums. ‘ «L

  
 
    
  
   
  
  
        
  
   
    
    
    
   
  
    
   
   
   
   
   
     
   
   
   
  
  
    
    
   
    
   
  
  
   
  
  
   
 

The telephone is constantly* ' 
ringing‘ in Tom Galante‘s since...
people need help or information,‘ or.
they just. want to talk. He. seems.

. eager to give informati_on,_to talk...
and especially to help. ' 

housing equipped to handle tlfi'e"ﬂ9Fis'”.j
predominantly for the blind.‘

"Engel stresses, howeye,r,_i-,_that
housing designed to scgregate._,thc,.
disabled is not the ultimate answer‘.
He proposes that community jdevesl-E

riated. to encourage-small land-l‘ords,_.

all that is needed to accommodate

changes, a landlord’ receives help in ~

Another plan. Engel hopes” to 1

Progress to date is evident.’ One"
notices~ more and. more curb cuts
along city streets. -Many public rest-

Developer May  

  S Have Slipped

In Own Cement

A local Pittsburgh developer may have slipped in his
own cement last week with the announcement of pos-
sible plans to construct a hotel in the 3-acre sitelbehing
Oakland Masonic Temple and the Syria Mosque.

William J. Beynon of Beynon and Co., who obtained
99-year leases on the property, is hinting at plans to
develop a hotel on the property—property currently
being used as parking facilities by Pitt commuters and
other Oakland residents. ‘ .

' The development of a hotel is not a bad idea in and
of itself; Oakland and the surrounding community can
always use additional commerce.

But the development of a hotel, or any structure for
that matter, on one of the two parking areas closest to
the Cathedral of Learning puts a greater burden on the
Pitt commuter than is necessary.

Although Beynon made assurances that parking will

I ' .. be continued ‘.‘indeﬁnit_el'y,,” the time will eventually

Cathedral, the lot between Carnegie and Hillmah
libraries. ’ V
This is the time we're afraid of.

CI-CIIIIIIICCIIIQQ

Oakland used to have two major hotels: the Schen-
ley Hotel,Jnow the" Pitt Student Union, and the Webster
Hall Hotel,now being converted to apartments. Now
there are only two hotels in the area. the Crossgates Inn

at Forbes Avenue and McKee Place, and the Howard
Johnson's on the Boulevard of the Allies.

The two hotels, the Schenley and Webster Hall, were
of invaluable service to the Oakland community when
they were in operation. To same. there was no need to
have an excuse to stay at the Schenley other than to
enjoy the splendor and luxury of a first—class hotel. And

for others who preferred the Webster, it was a comforta--

ble place to stay while visiting relatives or conducting
business in the Oakland or nearby Squirrel Hill and
Shadyside districts of Pittsburgh.

But with the extensive expansion of Pitt during the
sixties and on into the seventies, most of the business
conducted in Oakland was university business; hence,
the aquisition of Schenley Hotel and much of the sur-
rounding land area. A '

And when the management of the Webster Hall
Hotel found they could make a better profit leasing
apartments rather than relying on a shrinking guest list,
they opted for" conversion" to pr_lvate_apartments...

- Today, persons staying in Oakland for short periods of
time--usually someone's parents or someone conduct-
ing business with Pitt—-hbve only tow choices of accom-
modations the Crossgates Inn and the Howard
Johnson's. '

So the case can be effectively argued for additional
hotel space in the Oakland area; but so can the case
for additional parking.

There are two major parking areas for the general
public in the Oakland area surround_ing the Cathedral
of. Learning: the lot between” Carnegie and Hillman
libraries, and the two lots which will be displaced by the
construction of a hotel behind the Masonic Temple
and the Syria Mosque. ‘

There was recently some discussion centering on the
development of a two—tier underground parking lot in
the Carnegie-Hillman lot, possibly doubling the
amount of parking available in that area. But if Pitt's
administration has any say, the two—tier parking lot will
be the lot that never was. I

So, after all the hot air has passed over, we're left with
the simple reality of a dwindling supply of parking spa-
ces for an increased amount of Pitt commuters.

This is a simple case of cost/ benefit analysis: are the
benefits to be accrued from more hotel rooms in Oak-
land greater than the costs of displacing Pitt's commu-
ters?g Taking our own priorities into consideration, that is,
the welfare of our fellow students, we would have to say
no to you Mr. Beynon, we'd rather have the parking

areas. . . , -

By LIANE NORMAN '

I had an inkling of what it meant .

to be an adult at an inglorious
moment, sitting on the toilet, out of
toilet paper. With clear insight, I
understood that all my life someone
had seen to it that full rolls of toilet
paper had succeeded empty ones.
The adult, seeing what needed
doing, took responsibility without
being told by anyone else to do it.
In those terms, I've pondered

what a person shouldhave done in‘

Naz_i.Germany. Suppose I knew that
gas ovens were being produced, on

 .‘government contract, -by a local

company, to be used against

L . ‘.‘und_esirables“ who, in some_ way,
_ _"-“jeopardized national "security. I
‘I I 3 could try my best not to know. I

could disapprove and pay my taxes.
I could write a letter to the editor or
to my congressperson. Icould refuse
ajob in the factory, or take one and
make a fuss from within. I could
protest in front ofthe factory, talk to
the factory owner, sit in the factory
doorway. Or I could try to interrupt
the‘ factory’s production. I would be

A’ , responsible for whatever course I

chose. *

'We know that many Germans
said later they didn't know about the
gasvgvens. Even high Nazi officials

said they weren't responsible: they
only followed orders.

Recently, my husband and I sold
our GE stock, explaining in a letter
that we objected to profiting for the
Mark I2 A nuclear warheads, which
are multiply mounted on American
missiles. These weapons, we said,
are the gas ovens of our time. I also

wrote a letter to a local man who sits.

on GE’s board, asking ifa concerned

group could see him. No, the latter~

said: he was not responsible for

. talking to the public.

The investor relations man at GE,

" whose job‘ it is to talkto the public ‘I
_'wrote. that GE can do nothing: '
.“YourV objections to D
~manufacture of military equipment

the

national defense policy...'."’ GE
merely fills orders, he said, though
the nation's ﬁfth largest military
supplier has gotten rich ﬁlling such
orders, is the nation‘s fourth largest
spender in research and
development, and spends $l2l
million a year to persuade the public

' that GE “brings good things to life."

There are over 50,000 nuclear
weapons, over a million

that can't be spent" to feed hungry
people or cure their diseases or even
to repair bridges and potholes. It’s
no good blaming the Russians for
we've led every step of the way.‘

The UN,Comprehensive Study of
Nuclear_Weapons says that policy
does not determine technology, but
vice versa.

Thus, greater -accuracy in
weapons has ‘led .us toarticulate a; '
first strike policy, ' according to
which we'd try to ._get Russian
missiles before they could leave their
silos; But it‘ wouldn't do any good..
No matter how beautifully such an

attack went, they could still wipe us «
— ‘out with what they had left. And if

they hit first, we could do the same-

The reliance on such insanity
teaches us that life isn’t worth much.
Robert McNa-mara, as secretary of
defense, said that America would
accept casualties up to about .a
quarter of our population. Herman
Kahn says we'd be willing to lose
between ten and 60 million people in

nuclear war. I1“'that’s true, it means '

meanwhile drops to 9-9’overall and
4-3 in the conference.

The game began slowly as both
teams seemed tense, WVU
committed two consecutive
turnovers on-bad passes and Pitt
turned the ball -over three times,
‘once due to a traveling violation.

‘Once the first baskets were
pumped in, the players for both
squads loosened up and played a

The 30 team extravaganza

Freshman Todd Colasandjunior
Greg Conover led the Panther

across the finish line in the 1000 yard
run with a winning time of 2:1 l.7.
Conover covered the 880 yard dis-
tance in l:53.26, earning him First
place. Conoveralso set a new meet
record with his winning time. eclips-
ing the old mark of l:55.l set last
year. The 880 event was Pitt_’s
strength, as three Panthers occupied
the top six slots. Conover’s team-
mates. Terry Gallagher (l:53.45)

lane in an attempt to dunk the ball.
It hit the back of the iron and
rebounded some 40 feet into the air
and McMillian was called for a
technical foul, grabbing onto the
rim.
WVU’s Greg Jones, who led the
Mounties with nine points in the
first half, failed to hit the freebie.
When Pitt got control of the ball,
Carlton Neverson fed Paul
Brozovich underneath the basket for
aneasy two.

The game continued along close
until the Mountaineers were able to
open up a five point lead, l5-l0. The

, key to the WVU spurt was Jones

who was fouled while in the act of
shooting and converted the three
point play.

The Mounties were trying to get
into a run-and-gun transition game
with Pitt but could not keep it in
control. Sam Clancy, Pitt’s leading
scorer in the first half with 12, was
able to hit ajump shot to cut the lead
to three. Dwayne Wallace then
scored on a lay—up after a WVU
turnover and the lead was only one.

West Virginia’s Quentin Freeman
scored off a fast break to give his
team a 19-16 lead. Steve Beatty then
entered the game for Paul Brozovich
and quickly became the center of
attention.

First, Beatty was fouled while

' shooting and the shot was blocked:
' But WVUwas called forgoaltending 
"and Beatty went to the line. He

missed the shot but got his own‘
rebound and was-_fouled once again.
Pitt inbounded the ball to Beatty
who was called for traveling
underneath the basket. 

When West Virginia brought the
ball to their end, Beatty fouled Phil

Collins to send the Mountaineer to '

the stripe. Collins hit both ends of
the one-and-one and West Virginia

_took the lead 20-l-8.

Clancy tied the game when he

...stg_l_e‘éa’/pass from Collins and went in

untouched for a slam dunk. The lead
exchanged hands a couple more

times before West Virginia gained a .

3l-28 half—time lead.

The Mountaineers came storming »
out to begin the‘ second half as
Collinsblocked a shot and fed Jones
for an easy two. Pitt missed another
shot and West Virginia quickly
upped its lead to seven, 35-28.»

Pill News Sports Writer

Sitting in the Pitt lockeroom.
Tom Robinson. scorer ofthreegoals
and 2 assists in the Panthers 8-I vic-
tory _over Gannon University Satur-
day. spoke about the team's effort in
this particular contest. 7

“It was one of the better contests
that we’ve played, as everyone

played. as well as they possibly
could." he said.

A ‘native of Valley Forge, Pa..
Robinson's all out play assisted in
bringing another victory to Pitt.
Pitt_’s momentum was,,strong after
Robinson popped in a...q_uick shot’

  

' .f0£'¢-‘.3 period}, llllﬁk in

losing effort against West Virginia

West Virginia was beginning to
take control byusing an effective
fastbreak offense. Pitt wasjust not
able to run-and-gun with the
Mountaineers."

WVU’s lead expanded to nine

‘ mainly because the.Panthers could

not convert their shots. West
Virginia didn’t shoot much better
but was able to follow their first
shots with easy tip-ins.

While leading 43-34,‘ WVU coach
Gale Ctaleet apparently did not like
a call by the officials and when time
resumed, Clyde Vaughn was given
four technical shots. The freshman
connected on three of them and cut
the deficit -to six.

plae finish. Baynes and Brown

-ﬁnished fifth and sixth respectively 4

in the 600 yard dash. Baynes crossed
the line at the l:l2.7 mark, followed

by Brown, whose time» was l:l2.76. '

A Wrapping up the Pitt scoring
drive was the one mile relay team..
-The". q-uartet of Baynes, Brown,

their first tallie at 2:04 of the first
period.

Throughout the rest ofthe ga'me
forechecking an hardchecking was
evident by both teams involved.
But, because ofsome great efforts by
players such a goaltender Jeff
Rohay and Brian Morgan the
Panthers were able to hold off any
threat.

Morgan’s penalty killing ability
was very beneficial as Gannon was '
unable to capitalize on any power
play chances.

‘Fred Erny was truly, surprised
'with' the tea'm“s play. V “We usually
llose steam '-"going,into the third ;

  

-But just as-the Panthers were -

gaining momentum to get back in
the game,‘ West Virginia ran
magnificent offensive plays to keep
Pitt down. Pitt tried to put full court
pressure on the Mounties but they
broke the pressure in textbook
fashion by passing upcourt.

There was one impressive'play
where West Virginia was pressured
off an inbounds pass 'and four
players touched the ball and got it to

their end without a single dribble. .

Russel Toddfinished the job with a
slam dunk.

The last ten minutes of the game’

was a track meet and Pitt could not
run with West Virginia. The

Octavius Burnett and Mario Joyner
churned out a time of 3:22.33, cross-
ing the line in third place.

Meet .records were set in three
events.‘ . Bailey, of Frostburg State,

hustling well and played one‘ of the
best games of the season." _

Coach Jim Nelson was particu-
larly happy about the showing ofhis.
team. “I thought they hustled well
and everyone gave their all. The
guys knew what they had to do and
they did it."

One of the many positive aspects
in the game was the Pitt fans in
attendance. Though they were few,
the amount of Panther pride was
great. '

THE ELEPHANT MAN
Written by Bernard Pomerance
Directed by Brent Peek
Broadway Theatre Series
Heinz Hall

January 19-21, 1981

By J.D. Kleinke

The Elephant Man is a tough play to take. Provoca-

3 tive and painfully honest, it is the story of John

R

_z’

Merrick. Merrick the freak; Merrick the bizarre
sideshow gimmick; Merrick the extraordinarily
sensitive human being. J
Playwright Bernard Pomerance turns an inti-
mate eye toward Merrick’s struggle. Onstage is his
ascent from wretched cripple to the adopted son of
the English gentry. Merrick discovers in himself
" compassion and a keen- power of insight into the
arts and into people. But he discovers other things
as well.

With child-like simplicity, he marvels at the A

seemingly ridiculous code of mores that governs
(and restrains) Victorian society. He fails to under-
stand the immorality ascribed to the unclothed
human body, an unappreciated beauty he cherishes
as only the Elephant Man can.

 

‘Aside from a painfully
distorted representation
of the Elephant Man's
physical grotesqueness,
Burr brings out his sen-

 sibility.’

With Yet Another Winner

’Elephant Man’lUnblemished By Spatial Problems

Courtney Burr in the title role knows more than
Merrick’s physical agony; he knows the Merrick
psychology. Aside from a painfully distorted
representation of the Elephant Man's physical gro-
tesqueness, Burr brings out his sensibility. With a
tempering of grayish-black humor, he magnifies
Merrick’s astonishment at how his society
operates.

But the character runs deeper still; because Mer-
rick falls in love. He is a passionate man. Sensitive
to the first woman who can overlook his appear-
ance. She is his first compa’nion—an actress by
trade—one who is ’’trained to pretend." But she
stops pretending, and touches his heart. Brought
to life by Joan Grant, there is an added depth to a
character that could all too easily fall flat into stock.

Adding the final ironic twist to the play, he recip-
rocates her efforts, and touches her heart. A rela-
tionship of emotional interdependence unfolds; a
bizarre but beautiful relationship. E

In this way, the Merrick spirit grows, pervading
the lives of those around him. Kenneth Garner as
the sometimes sterile, but always sensitive doctor,
Frederick Treves, provides the perfect embodi-
ment of the Victorian consciousness. Thus, the
conflict arises—between doctor and patient,
between savior and saved. 4 A

Indeed the play works, but that is only luckily in a
few of the overall aspects of the production. '

Heinz Hall as a theater, is clumsy at best; and the
finer points of a tight drama had to be amplified, for
the ear and for the eye. Quite understandable. But
there is over—compensation on the part of the phys-
ical staging. The actors are placed in wide-open
formation, with much of their dialogue spoken
directly to the audience. This is a rather flagrant
breech of current theatrical code.

As a result, the staging seems, if not at first odd,
then very encumbersome to an audience trying to
”fall into" the drama. The actors turn and tell,
rather than do and show, creatinga pronounced
and awkward distance between house and stage.

Mercifully, much f thisproblem is alleviated by
a set that is stout and trongly squared off. Consid-
ering its necessary universality, with changes to

By THOM PALMER

What director Jed Harris and the
troupe at Theatre Express always
seem to lack is convention. Whether
it be material, characterization, sets
or lighting, they bend over back-
wards to avoid any white bread pro-
ductions. Such aspirations constitute
"the importance of Dusa, Fish, Stas, arid
Vi. Nothing outlandish or bawdy; just

a delicate sense of action and res- V

traint and a good bit of loyalty to their
material. 1

Pam Gems’ play is a voyeur’s
inquiry of four women. sharing a flat
in London. But its major function is
the exploration of dualities, focusing
deeply past each characters’. one layer
and onto the next. Thus, the interac-
tion of all four takes on a multiplicity
of situation and circumstance.

Dusa (Lisa Bansavage) is a divorcee
embittered and overwrought by the
kidnapping-of her children by her ex-
husband, who has taken them“out to

.5)’ the country. ‘Fish (Janet Reed) is a
" politically active woman whose

I four, yetp'her‘pre-occupations are the‘

education through whoring, and Vi
(Pam Norris) is a tiny, unemployed
cynic prone to self—destructive impul-
siveness. What hangs over the four,
and makes up the energy of the pro-
duction, is the constant volatile‘

and a comradic sense of desolation
thatjcreeps into their lives at differ-
ent points throughout the play.

' What surfaces first, and maintains
strength throughout the play are the
dichotomies of eac character. Dusa’s
professional life (assuming that she
has one) is completely excluded from
her constant concerns. Her goals are

back to her care. But while this takes
precedence, she also maintains the
concerns of the women around her.
Fish is the authoritarian. She holds
interest in the lives of the‘others, but
her interest is more guarded;.alrnost
aloof. Things fall in perspective for
her when they are juxtaposed with
the events in her life. And her life is
more or less clouded by an elasticized
facade that is an extension of her
profession.
Stas and’Vi seem like two outsid-
ers. They are not two to volunteer
personal experience, and only really
comment when called upon or com-
pelled. Their preferences and actions
aremore hard—edged, and realistic.

THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING
WOMAN

Directed by Joel Schumacher
Screenplay by Jane Wagner

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Lily Tomlin is easily the most inge-
nious comedienne to come along-
since Lucille Ball. Not content to
merely wallow in the confinesof
comedy, she tried her hand at serious
acting (Nashville and Moment By
Moment) with less than spectacular
results. Apparently she learned her
lesson because she's back in an all-
stops-out comedy called The Incredible
Shrinking Woman.

The Incredible Shrinking Woman mixes
the real with the absurd. Everyday
American life is shown as one long
process of advertising; it's a minia-
ture model of pop culture in the
eighties.

Pat Kramer is the absolutely aver-

-age housewife. She lives in middle-

class suburbia, has two children, a
station wagon, nosy neighbors, and a
Spanish maid with whom she can
barely communicate. Her husband

down the street (”Boat Sheen will

the picture of domestic bliss and per-
fection. That is, until she starts to
shrink.

One morning, she wakes up to find
that she can -no longer_reach her hus-
band's lips without heels. As her
clothes grow bigger by the day, Pat
grows more and more panic-stricken
as she realizes that she's shrinking at
a fast pace. She's rushed off to a
scientific medical center where, after
hundreds of tests, she's told why
she's shrinking: it's acombination of
her tap water, her perfume, tooth-
paste, talcum powder, deodorant,
detergent, soda, etc., etc. In other
words, all the chemicals and synthet-
ics that are unthinkingly used by peo-
ple. every day are what's shrinking
Pat Kramer. '

-The process can't -be stopped,
though, and as Pat shrinks, her noto-
riety grows. People stand in her yard
trying to catch a glimpse ofher, she's
the top story on the nightly news, she
makes the covers-of Time and News-
week, and she's the first guest on a
Mike Douglas'Show. « 8

Pretty soon, she's down to just a,’

few inches high. She wears Barbie-

doll clothes and lives in a doll house, -

all the while insisting that she wants

  

5"“?

to be treated like anyone else. Her.
kids fight over who's going to bring
mom in for Show-and-Tell and her

husband voraciously reads "Marriage '

Without Sex."

Pat is kidnapped and whisked off to
a laboratory, though her family
thinks that she was killed by falling
into the garbage disposal. They hold a
mock funeral in the backyard and
people say things like, ”...to a woman
who gave so much and got so little,”

and ”No one will ever be able to fill 

her shoes."

Meanwhile, ‘back at the lab,,a' mad '
scientist (Henry Gibson) is the perpe- -

trator of a diabolical plot in which
he'll use a serum from Pat's blood to
shrink _most of the world's inhabit-
ants. But Pat escapes with the help of

a gorilla ,(a la Fay Wray and King ~

Kong) and returns just’ long enough
to make a dramatic speech before she.

she?
The Incredible Shrinking Woman is top-ﬁg

notch, fromgthle writing and the act-
ing- right down to the set design,
which is done entirely in candy-pinks

 Frerzch Film Gets Bagged Down In Its Own Miser}/my

Tuesday, February 3, 1981——Page 5

By Jane Holahan

Clair De Femme reminds me of
expensive French perfume——-it's tres
chic, tres important, but oppressively
heavy. And like French perfume,
Claire De Femme probably wears better
on a woman of the world than it does
a happy—go—lucky college student.

This film assumes that its audience
is ready to play their game, that it is
ready to take despair as a casualty of
life. If you don't want to, or can't play
the game, or accept the consequen-
ces, the it becomes more of a satire
than anything else. '

Everyone is so glum and depressed.
And though they manage a smile
here and there, you feel as if life is a
misery for them.

The film explores two days in the
life of Michel ‘(Yves Montand) and
Lydia (Romy Schneider). Two more
miserable people cannot possibly
exist in Paris. .

Michel has been sent away by his
wife so she can commit suicide. At
first the film is murky about it---are
they getting a divorce, does he hate
her or love her? Lydia is getting over
the death of her daughter, who was
killed in a car accident, which also left
her husband, who was driving, so dis-
traught that he has gone insane.

The two meet by accident, and
immediately start an intense, claus-
trophobic relationship. Why do these
two strangers desire each others’
company so intensely?

Michel and Lydia try to answer our
questions with profundity after pro-
fundity. Michel will say something
like "What is life but waiting?" and
Lydia will stare at him and say, "You
will know some day." ’

The film is asking the audience to
fill in the blanks with their ownexpe—

riences. But it you are even a little -

hopeful about life, all you can do is
make fun of all this "deep meaning"
stuff.

It's not that you don't care about
these two people, because you do.
Schneider and Montand are both
extremely skilled actors, and are fas-
cinating to watch. This film does not
bore you; in fact it moves by quite
swiftly.

But what is it saying? Does it just
like to hear itself talk? After a while
you wonder if Lydia and Michel have
spent their whole lives waiting to
meet so they could gutter their heavy
phrases to each other.

Superficially this film is like The
Story of /liiele H, for both are about
obsessions, but Clair De Femme fails

'First Family’ Falls Flat.

where the other succeeded. Adele H
built up its own little world, and we

-watched it closing in on Adele.

There is no such little world in Clair
De Femme. We don't get to know the
characters, their habits or a hint of
their lives before despair took over.
As far as we are concerned Michel has
always been and always will be
miserable.

Pseudo-Satire Fumbles Big Hurn'oriPlay

FIRST FAMILY
Written and directed by Buck Henry

By ].D. KLEINKE

Gilda Radner has never been cuter.
Madelaine Kahn has never been
drier. Bob Newhart has never been
President. That is until Buck Henry
decided to take a- rather National
Lampoon—i.sh view of one of our
nation's latest Foundling Fathers. But

. where Lampoon satire (and Saturday

Night Live satire; and MAD maga-
zine satire) mushrooms from hyper-
bolic situations, First Family does not.
It is hyperbolic, indeed; but once the

satirical stage is lit, no one even ‘

comes close to breaking the lights.
It is a film based on characteriza-

~ tion. Creating theillusion that some-

one does in fact run the country,
Henry shows us the President and all
his men at their finest.

But characterization should be a
starting point, not the be—all, end-all.
So what does that leave First‘Family?
Certainly not a story. Or any profun-
dity. Or any lasting impression.

hour of "here's a pen for the senator
from Rhode Island (he's a midget)”

and the script promises us two—hours '

packed with sight-gags, one-liners,
and either direct or implied
”Carterslams.".

But such is not the case. Buck
Henry runs out of jokes, the script
dies in the middle, and the film creeps
through an intolerably prolonged
terminal illness. Thelsymptoms: an
over-concentration on the yucks that
open the film, an unconvincing
sequence dissecting the recently-

former—president's emotional insta-

' bility, and a laggard pace owing to

some grave mis-calculations in the
cutting room.

whelms the screen, a problem
especiallygimminent when contrasted
with Newhart's characteristic
subtlety. g

The situation is almost tragic,
because the premise for First Family is
a classic. A contemporary classic,
anyway. " '

When asked about the making of
the film, Bob Newhart responded:
"When we started shooting, First Fam-
ily was a satire. When we ‘finished, it
was a documentary.”

Science Fiction Rumpled,

THE HUMANOID TOUCH
Jack Williamson
Holt, Reinhart, and Winston

By GEORGE SHANER ,

If you're the average person, you
probably don't know that much about
Science Fiction. If it has space ships,
robots, and rayguns, it's true to type.
This may cause confusion if you have
a friend who is serious about SF and
who vehemently insists that Star Wars
or Battlestar Galactica isn't SF. Or at
least not very good SF.

.In that case, you should probably
try Jack Williamson's new novel to
get the point.

It concerns one of his oldest
themes; a group of perfect machines

so bent on serving man that the race '

is suppressed. If this was pulp, the
young hero, Keth Kyrone, would find’

ble tide. One that went against all

rational expectations. »
Seeing that this is SF, though, and

not Space Opera (i.e., a Ronald Rea-

gan western with rayguns), that g

doesn't happen. Events follow
through to their logical conclusion
and the invinceable machines win.

Keth does findsanctuary in the end ..

and that is the one problem. His
escape is on the level of suddenly’

on Langella’s cover-boy

Now the Prince of Darkness
has been revived again and is

stalking the Pittsburgh Labor-

Dracula: Sabbat.

Katz’s Dracula is a most
bizarre and unique version of
the vampire legend; blending
Eastern European folklore
with satanism, sixties’ acid
rock, and psychedelic drugs.
The unlikely combination-of
the Dracula theme and sixties’
psychedelia may seem to strain
awkwardly, but the Satanic
element is what weaves them
together. The play_ is shaped
into a Black Mass ritual, a
“sabbat,” where thegcelebrants
worship Dracula as Satan in a
fiesta of blood, spiritual,.and
sexual fulfillment. According
to Katz, the psychedelic expe-
rience is integrated into the
ceremony because the loss of
control, the fear, and the

associated with the frenzied
climax of the Sabbat.

The audience is persuaded
to imagine themselves on a

the play. A hollow unseen
voice leads them. through each
stage of the trip, quotingfrom
Timothy Leary’s The Psyche-

SPECIAL EVENTS

New Realm Of Unconvential Dance Comes To Pitt

By ROBERT BALLON

Kei Takei’s compositions,
totally individualistic, stem from
the structures of Modern Dance
in America. The seriousness and
audacity of the choreography
stands alone in performance.
Takei strives for the core of
expression.

The sound of dancers’ bodies
moving, their breath, and their
tension, comprise a stark, aural
landscape which, when combined
with the drone murmur of
chants and shifting pools of light
and darnkess, give Takei’s work
a heightened drama.

Moving Earth, a dance group
who recently performed through
the Floating Theatre at the Ste-
phen Foster Memorial, is a com-
pany of ten_performers who
dance the works of Kei Takei.
Many of the company members
have been working since Moving
Earth was founded in 1969.

The evening's program was
presented by only three of the
company's members; it included
four parts from Light.

Light is concerned with elemen-
tal human experience, both

' ancient and contemporary. Taut
and concentrated, it awakens_
slumbering memories of ances-
tral struggles. Light is also the
cognomen of the work's individ-
ual movements, and contains
various meanings which project
from it. The dance seems Eastern
in its formal clarity and Western
in its experimental impulse.

Takei’s Light ”Part 5" has
dancers Johnstone and Pate in a
pool of light. One dancer, every
muscle taut, clings to the other,
who is sometimes stretched and
taut, sometimes collapsed. Kei’
Takei stretches upward, beauti-
fully arched, toward the light,
andthen thoughtfully joins the
pair, placing her head on an arm.
The trio crumples to the floor in

Kei Takei’s Moving Earth in performance

slow motion, rising again only to
stretch and crumple in a new 1
pattern. _

Kei Takei is spellbound in Light
”Part 8." Hissing like a cat,
pounding the floor with quiver-
ing feet, flicking her arms per-
cussively, and much like a bobcat
toying with her prey, Takei jos-
tles a pile of rags, and one by
one, knots them around her
nearly naked_ body. Her cavorting
ritual of sitting and knotting
plods on as sing-song voices
drone on in a Buddhist chant. At
the end, Takei is barely able to

move; she's been hobbled up by‘ A

- the mound of rags.

In Light ”Part 10" Pate and I
Johnstone throw stones at Takei;

"intently they remove stones

from their sacks and roll them
across the stage. In upward arm
swings, Takei affirmatively
strikes her own large rocks
together. As more stones i/attle
around her feet, she confidently
picks her way among them. Each
step is like a firm caress. But
when she loses her stones, first
one, then a second, she seems to
lose her power, and,‘ inexorably,

Theatre Express. .,.(cont. from page 3)

most honorable and honest. She can-
not get the loss of her children off her

mind, and her’s is a day to day strug-

gle with this reality. This is a perfect
contrast to Fish, who, though seem-
ingly composed and calculated,
proves eventually that she cannot
function within her world's hapless
framework. Though there is no open
hostility, the women are obviously on
opposite ends of an attitude
spectrum.

Stas’ personality is understood
when viewed as one of avoidance.
She justifies her livelihood by simply
blocking it out, but it creeps in at
times in the form of pessimism. And
Vi’s haphazard style lends itself to
her capriciousness. ‘

. When viewed as a whole, Gems’
V  play looks like a bout of bulwarks.
__ ‘Whose will crumble first? Whose will

" be bared for what it is worth. For Stas

 I and Vi, it is a defense system of modi-

fications. For Dusa it is goal satisfac-
tion, and for Fish, it is a death wish

_loyalty to a sinking ship.

and memorable_characterization. Her
performance is more striking perhaps
because of her demure opening.
There is a reality grip to all of
Gems’ characters, much like those
present in a number of David Mamet
plays. Harris milks these, and his cast
uses his leads well. Janet Reed takes
Fish's cosmopolitan bitchiness and
runs with it, putting the rest of the

women in clearer perspective.’ Her
performance is well thought out, and
serves to intensify the production as
it careens toward its climax.

Dusa, Fish, Stas and ‘Vi completes
itself by maintaining its goal
throughout. It is a study of personal-
ity construction, and the subsequent
functioning of them. Their purpose is

the men herd her to the side of
the stage. Takei displays no emo-
tion and the men show no
aggression, but the audience
feels a deep, uneasy fear. _

In Light ”Part_ 14" (Pine Cone
Field), Takei and Pate share a
ritual walk with baskets of cones
on their backs. With an endless
chant of ”Ho!", infinite shades of
meaning fill their inflections. 
One could interpret it as some-
thing like ”two souls on the road
of life.”

At the climax of Takei’s work,
Johnstone holds Pate and opens
his mouth in a soundless cry of
horror in stop-action camera.-
Accompanied by incessant bongo
drums, the embraces appear
traumatic and the men, victims.
Only Takei does not stretch taut;
she seems to aply solace and
compassion to the victims, deriv-
ing her power from her upward
stretch toward the light. _

The first thinglone notices
about the dancesare the absence
of traditional dance technique.
There are no pirouettes, jetes, or
contractions. "Instead, there are
dynamic qualities: tense, rigid,
limp, flopping, sagging, gliding,
heavy’ earthbound dancers. A
definite sense of weight is the
essential ingredient that distin— ‘
guishes Takei’s work from ballet

, or other forms of modern dance-

There are no. lifts or suspended‘

one-legg‘ed‘.balances which defy 3

metaphor. Man‘ does not escape ~ » 

his condition. He struggles and is
defeated. And struggles

again. . .it is the driving force of I
all humanity.- ' .

In a sense, that is what Kei’s
dances are, about. But still, the
imagination is limitless. The-
dancers are resplendent with
potential interpretation. Limit-
less, yes, as are the meanings

_. one can derive from Kei Takei’s
Moving Earth. ' ‘

not howkthey blend, or, conflict, but
_ how, in the end, they can adapt. And
finally adapting is -something that,

now and then, some personalities E ,

may never do.

INTERVIEW

lrmitirzzied from page 7)

happened, both of them, but in retro-
spect it's the best thing that's hap-
pened to us. Now, for the first time,
we're with a company (EMI) who
really believes in us and is supporting
us, financially and emotionally,
which are both important. They're
out there working the record.
Because of that, and coupled with the

’ fact I think it's the best record we've

made, it's the most successful so far.
So far it's just been a great relation-
ship and we're really pleased with it.
SHOWCASE: I noticed on the album
Caliin Fever that it was recorded in
Wales and London. What kind of
influence did that have on the overall
tone or quality of the record?
PELANDER: It had a definite influ-
ence. The tunes were all written
before we went over, we rehearsed
them there and made some minor
changes in the arrangement. From a
production standpoint, it sounded, if
such a thing is possible, more English
or European, since Robert John (Mutt)
Lange produced it. (*Note—'Mutt'
Lange has produced Graham Parker,
City Boy, AC/DC and others.
When we went to do that album it
was on only 4-5 days notice. Arista
picked the producer, told us when to
start and where to go to do it. We got
on a plane, went to England and met
-this crazy guy we had never met and
started working. It's definitely differ-

ent, kind of a departure from the-

Ladies Choice album.

STANLEY: I think it's very different!
It's a very different sounding record.
We were talking about this the other
night amongst ourselves, that work-
ing with Robert John Lange wasa real
learning experience. We learned a lot
of things that we carried. over into
Heartland. He was a different type of
producer that we'hadn’t worked with
before.

SHOWCASE: Time to push that new
album. The title is Heartland. What's
the significance behind that?
STANLEY: Basically, it's just a word
that summed up the whole feeling of
the album to me. Sort of the "Mid—
west experience" that we've all
grown up in and grown as musicians

in. Besides that, it's just a neat word '

and it fits better on T-shirts!
SHOWCASE: When you went into
the studio to record Heartland, what
did you want to accomplish musically,
and did you succeed?

STANLEY: We didn't have a record
label when we went in to record the
album and we were also undertaking
-the production of it ourselves for the
first time. So basically, we were hop-
ing that we could make an album that
we were happy with and proud of,
and then sell to a label and get back in
the flow of things, after leaving
Arista.

I'm VERY happy and proud of it! I‘
definitely think it's our best album
from all standpoints: playing, sing-
ing, writing. I even likethe cover the
best!

SHOWCASE: Clarence Clemons
(Springsteen's E Street Band) appears
on the new album on a few cuts. How
did this come about? . .

PELANDER: When we had‘ all the
basic tracks down, certain people had
ideas for certain tunes that they
wanted sax in. We had Ricky (Bell) do
some of the work. Michael had worked
with David Sanborn in the—past, so we
tried to contact him to get some ofhis

 

» SHOWCASE:

mixing his new album and the band
was off, not touring, looking for
something to do. So Mr. Belkin, our
manager, hooked us up with Clar-_
ence for about six hours or so one
evening. It was kind of intimidating
at first, but he was great to work with.
It was one of our biggest thrills, for all
of us. .
SHOWCASE: Would you like to hav
him around again in the future?
PELANDER: I wish he was here right
now.

STANLEY: I'd like to have him just as
a bodyguard!

What about your
audience? Do you have a certain
target audience that you try to write
or play for or do you just hope your
music finds its own following? '
STANLEY: There's not a tremend-
ous amount of thought that goes into
something like 'Let’s be more rock and
roll’, or 'Let’s be less rock and roll’ or
'Let’s do more ballads’ or this or that.
It comes down to whatever the wri-
ters in the band are writing. There's
four people writing in the band right
now, so there's a lot of variety that
way“; Then we pick the things that
hold together best as an album; the
thingsthat we believe in. Hopefully, if
we believe in them, we can put them

whole idea for us is to have fun and
hopefully they will find something

SHOWCASE: What about your
audiences around the country?

Where are some of your strongholds?
Pittsburgh seems to have been a little
cool toward you in the past.
STANLEY: That's an understate-
ment! I think it's basicaly due to a lack
of airplay on the radio here. Familiar-
ity has so much to do with people
getting used to what you do or at
least making a decision as "to whether
they like it or don't like it.‘If they
never hear you, then they really don't
have the chance to make up their
mind if they want to come see you

LONCEPTST

THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND
Civic Arena

Ianuary 13, 1981

I By ].D. KLEINKE

Legends die. Great champions tire.
Zealous warriors grow old.

And so too have the Allman Broth-
ers. The spirit is gone; dead and bur-
ied. Perhaps not with Duane‘, but
sometime in the past few years. Two
years ago on the Enlightened Rogues
immortal
bands still had the punch, the fire.

‘But such was not the case on the

Allman's latest swing through Pitts-
burgh. The spirit, the drive, and the
guts; all are gone.

In the Arena, the Allman Brothers
played fast. Too fast. And too tidy.v
Seemingly afraid to explore those

familiar rhythms and their) endless
tangents, the band played on, and on,
and finished, and that was it. Profi-
ciently, mechanically, unexcitedly.
Blues are not blues when done at
an unflinching and methodically
upbeat tempo. That was, for the most
part,- the biggest breakdown in the
Allman Brothers legacy. Songs like
”Whipping Post,” ”Southbound,” and .
especially ”Statesboro Blues" are not
supposed to‘ bounce. They are sup-
posed to slither. Dickie Betts’ leads
sound best at their rawest. They
were not written for their calculated
smoothness, and sound ludicrous
when performed that way. They are
not supposed to sound like a Ric
Ozasek or Gary Numan multi-
monotone. A grave confusion of
genre for the ear. Betts’leads are sup-

—lA|\lGl|\J' OUT

posed to creep and crawl, and weave
in and out of the Allman Brothers’
skeletal but painful blues harmonies.

But weave they did not. And the set

as a whole did not slither. They‘

played every song, from opening
instrumental to the final encore
(”Statesboro Blues”) simply too fast.
Even the upbeat tempo of "Can’t
Take It With You" seemed,hurried.
Normally a hammering, adrenaline-
like song, the number was also too
rushed. And too compact. And too
impotent.

Without a ferocious effort on
organ and bass, ”Can’t Take It With.
You” sounded like one of those new-
fangled organs with the built-in per-
cussion. A bit too tidy.

Instead of doing what they do best,
the Allman Brothers Band offereda

. lot of flash, eye-catching or other-

wise. An amusing, but eventually
tiresome timpani solo, a flagrant
over-emphasis on the harmonic-a, and
a tedious, almost redundant set of
drum solos were all poor attempts at
dressing up an ailing act. *

Dampening the situation even
further, the sound was horrendous.
The new seating arrangement in the
Arena affords an excellent opportun-

ity for 5000 empty seats to hear a

really loud concert. Someone had to

' hear it, right?

On all points, it was a rather disap-
pointing evening.

The Allman Brothers Band came to
town one night last month; and had it
not been for the name, the legend,
few people would have even noticed.

Keeping In Touch With Pittsburgh's Hottest Bands I

some of Pittsburgh's hottest rock and

for each. Many of the new tunes are
in the set played during the evening

areas best bands performed, the Iron
City Houserockers on Friday and the
Silencers on Saturday. I was able to
talk with members of the bands and
get the scoop on the happenings and
plans of each. A .

Friday night, Joe Grushecky, guita-

 rist and vocalist, was very loose and

talkative. He told me the inside story
of the homecoming, the new album,
and life on the road.

4 The first Pittsburgh gig the House-
4 rockers did was the Civic Arena
opening for the Outlaws. Some fans
gave them a hard time, but as Joe put

into you. We had boo—birds at the
arena but that's stupid. Who boos the

’ If F home team? That's like rooting
“against the Steelers.” Joe likes being

home in Pittsburgh but he said it
looses‘ its excitement when you play
one place for too long. He did say
”Pittsburgh is a place to work, to pay

F: ii ‘ the bills.”

 “The Houserockers have kept busy
practicing and recording new mate-
rial. There are about 25 new songs

I:  ! .1/r ,_ . ..  .,:

  

In his words ”lnflation kills us.” Dur- 

ing the last tour the Houserockers
played some small clubs, headlined
some colleges, and opened shows for
Ian Hunter, Henry Paul, Southside
Johnny, and others. The start of the
tour was shaky due to lack of press on
the band or the album, but when the
critical acclaim for Have A Good Time
started pouring in the people noticed.

Of the press Joe said "You've got to
bring it down to street level, to con-
nect with the people. The best press
means nothing if the people aren't
into you.” '

Saturday night, the crowd at the

. Decade were hopping and the
Silencers were hot. After the first set
I got Ron Foster (drums) and Mike
Pella (bass) to answer a few questions
on whats been happening with the
band. ‘

The Rock And Roll Enforcers album
was the subject matter at the start of
the conversation. About it Ronnie
said ’’It didn't sell as many albums as I
expected, but it got great airplay. We
were on 32 major stations in the

country at onetime. We got a l_ot.”o‘fj . ,

I then ../moved on to the video
recording the group made. Mike rep-
lied, ”TPC Video, gave us a great
budget, wrote the script and really
took their time to make it nice. The
video airs on ”Rock World” and we
hope to play it Tuesday night at Fat
City."

To wind up my interview I asked
Ron about the new album, Romantic.
His response was, ”We've got it
taped, they're mixing it now. We pro-
duced this one ourselves, hopefully
that adds to our credibility as _musi-
cians. We basically did what we
wanted to do, a couple of reggae
things, some horn. parts here and
there but its still the same band.
Right now we're waiting on a release

March the new albumlwill be out.”

THE TURN OF A

qFRIENDLY CARD
Alan Parsons Project
Arista

Since 1976, the Alan Parsons

V Project has striven to gain the
mass acceptance that other
"concept" brainchildren such as

V Jeff Wayne's War Of The Worlds
have enjoyed. After looking at
 APP's credentials, one may
begin to wonder why they
haven't seemed to click yet. The
-Project has the combined out-
put of Alan Parsons, one of the
world's foremost music direc-
tors, producers, and engineers;

_ Eric Woolfson, the lyric—writing

‘ wonder of Britain; and the best
studio men and vocalists Europe
has to offer.

' The sad thing is that the Alan
Parsons Project has clicke-
d . . .and a long time ago atthat.
Since the release of their first
album, Tales of Mystery and Imagi-
nation, which dealt with the con-
cept of Edgar Allen Poe; and-
their successive releases of I
Robot, Pyramid, Eve, and now The
Turn Of A Friendly Card; Parson,
Woolfson and the gang have
been proving that they're
albums are ahead of the game
when it comes to pure musical
innovation. Consequently, the
avant-garde ingenuity of APP
has turned enough heads to

_ create a very strong cult
following.

, Nonetheless, the release of
The Turn Of A Friendly Card
( should inspire a deluge of new
APP follower and a smug feel-
ing from tried and true Project
aficionados. While The Turn Of/1
‘Friendly Card is not superior to
any of the previous Parsons
Projects, it remains consistent
as a meticulously crafted and
coyly addictive album. Unsur-
prisingly, the album is finally
finding its turf quite high on the
music charts and playlists, thus
getting its just exposure.
Thematically, Friendly Card
deals with thejtopics of gam-
bling, fortune, the power of
chance, and its psychological
effect on the people who
become addicted to it.

Katz strode in and everyone
snapped to attention as he ‘

4 took command. “Can I have

'everybody’s attention? We’re
going to work on the head

with our character embarking on a.

Aftera questionable opening, the
music accelerates. Employing such
diverse instruments as the violinand
the saxophone, it becomes engag-

" ingly rhythmic. The material that fol-

lows maintains a high level of

- sophistication up until the last piece.
This piece,‘ a tribute to Jimi Hendrix -

and the 60's,‘ is good, but not quite

The strong point of Friendly
Card is its use of vocals and gui-
tar hooks. This combination is
quite evident on the albums
first single release, "Games*Peo-
ple Play." This cut features
Lenny Zakatek on vocals-who
is by far the Projects best singer

“and a fetching dual guitar run
that makes this cut hard to res-
ist. Other tracks to note include,
’'I Don't Wanna Go Home,"
"Snake Eyes,” and "Nothing
Left To Lose.”

So for APP hard-cores and
newcomersialike, odds are The
Turn Of A Friendly Card is no
gamble when it comes to good
music.

The straight flush continues.

Carsickness intended its
second release to be a flexidisk
until the flexidisk’ people
refused to press the ‘record.
Available now as a conventional

shows their musical matur-

On the whole this single is
better than their EP of last
summer and the keyboards no

songs themselves, "Happy

"with characteristic Carsickness

CATHOLIC BOY
']-im Carroll Band

Jim Carroll is a semi-
establishedvauthor who is aim-
ing to be a semi-established
rock-n-roller‘ in a semi- .
established rock-n—roll' band.
Catholic Boy, his first product in
this semi-established role as
author/musician is...well...
semi-established.

What I'm trying to say is
Catholic Boy is a combination of
crests and troughs, ahs and
unhs, hits and misses. Yet, des- -
pite the lack of consistency, the
listener is ‘left with a more '_
favorable than negative attitude
of the album overall. ‘

Carroll is truly a master ofithe
pen‘ when it comesgto writing

- lyrics. His songs are saturated
with all sorts of nifty, elaborate
details and succulent phrasings
that reek of New York‘ Cityi
street savvy. Even better is ,the
method in which this shocking
verse is delivered—not by sing-
ing, but with a strung-out nasal
drawl that seems to hover above
the music. The effect is beauti-

' fully chilling...until his band
walks allover Carroll's vocals
with their muddy style. This
spoils all the fun. ‘ A ' .

With ‘tremendous execution
