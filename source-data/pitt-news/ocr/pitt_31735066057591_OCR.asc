With tears in her eyes and her

Students for Life participated
in the event by standing togeth-

ing “Abortion Kills Children”
and “Abortion Hurts Women.”
The student organization sup-
ports Life Chain and hopes to
achieve more of a pro-life
awareness with people.

“The purpose is to pray all at
one time,” said Sophia
Kusturis, public relations direc-
tor for Students for Life. ‘There

 

is a great hope in the power of
prayer.”

President of the organization,
Stephany Pritchett, said she had
great hopes for the demonstra-

Life Chain was to open the
consciousness of people walk-

their unconsciousness.

New Pitt
telescope
price tag
questioned

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s plans to invest
in an $8 million telescope
are “full speed ahead,”
despite opposition that says
it’s not a wise investment for
the university.

“I’m opposed to it, but the
man is the chancellor and
that’s the bottom line,” said
Phillip Wion, the chair of the
Senate Budget Policy
Committee.

According to Wion, the
chancellor will seek outside
gifts to fund the telescope or
will use his discretionary
funds. The chancellor said
there are some people will-
ing to pay for the telescope
because it is on the threshold
of science and great for the
university, Wion said.

The Pitt physics depart-
ment tried to get interest in a
telescope several years ago,
but the chancellor initiated
the inquiry for this particular
telescope project. It is not a
priority for the physics
department, said committee
member Maureen McClure.

The telescope is “clearly
not in the long—term benefit
of the university,” McClure
said.

“Maybe there’s some hid-
den agenda,” Wion said.

The committee also dis-
cussed the financial state-
ment for the last fiscal year
to June 30, to be presented to
the board of trustees on Oct.
21.

The fiscal report includes
specific endowment infor-
mation, five-year trends and
research trends, said William
Laird. The information is
presented in a useful way,

Ha/ey denies censorship at University Times

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

The University Times, a news-
paper published through Pitt’s
Office of Public Affairs, is in the
middle of a controversy stem-
ming from a gay wedding at
Heinz Chapel last month.

Leon Haley, vice chancellor
for student and public affairs
and the University Times pub-
lisher, found himself defending
the paper against calls that the

paper exhibited censorship.

Thursday’s Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reported that Haley
pulled a story about the first gay
wedding at Heinz Chapel out of
the Sept. 15 issue.

“I don’t consider this censor-
ship,” Haley said. “I made a
judgement passed on a policy
that we have.” According to
Haley, the University Times does
not report on any private events
held at the Heinz’Chapel, a Pitt-
owned building.

Pitt’s Bisexual Gay and
Lesbian Alliance Co-President
Chrissy Koch said she believes
censorship did play a role in the
decision not to run the story.

“That is censorship. It’s obvi-
ously blatant,” Koch said. “It
just shows that the university is
afraid to show what goes on at
the campus, especially in the
homosexual community.”

Barbara Shore, a member of
the University Times advisory
committee, was also upset the

story was pulled.

“My issue with the paper is
who will control the content of
the Times, and what will those
guidelines be,” Shore said.

The University Times’ editor,
Nancy Brown, said she would
not comment directly on the
story, but agreed with Haley that
censorship is not conducted at
the University Times.

“I have never before been told
not to run a story in my 15 years

WASHINGTON — American
troops will stop violence
between Haitians when they can
do so safely. But a senior
Pentagon official said Sunday
this does not mark a broadening
of U.S. policy.

“U.S. troopsare asked to stop
violence in the streets between
Haitian citizens provided there
are two conditions,” U.S.
Deputy Defense Secretary John
Deutch said on ABC television.
“One is the condition of safety
with respect to U.S. troops, the
second is that they have the
capability to do it.” The report
was published hours after gun-
men ﬁred on a crowd of hungry

TOKYO — Japan is willing to
re-open talks on its car parts
market with the United States
but has no new offers to make,
Minister of International Trade

said on Sunday.

Hashimoto, just back from
marathon trade talks in
Washington that failed to pro-
duce a pact on the thorny auto-
motive sector, said Japan felt

there was nothing new to say
about U.S. charges that Tokyo’s
parts market was discriminatory.

Japanese and U.S. negotiators
on Saturday reached agreements
in principle on opening up
Japanese glass, insurance and
government procurement mar-
kets —- they were the ﬁrst major

celebration of South African
democracy with a bid for for-

Greek l0l

educates
about
alcohol

By Erica Glasspool
For The Pitt News

Somber one moment,
then cheering and laugh-
ing the next, a couple
hundred Greek pledges
got a taste of the reality
of responsible drinking
from Mike Green, owner
of Collegiate Consultants
on Drugs and Alcohol,
during Greek 101 yester-
day.

The mandatory event
for pledges was filled
with speakers and pre-
sentations on subjects
such as alcohol aware-
ness, sexual assault ser-
vices, the Central Blood
Bank and Family House.
The day-long affair helps
new pledges get integrat-
ed into the Greek system.

“It’s the starting point
of involvement to the
Greek system,” said Joe
Puder, chairman of
Greek 101.

Greek l01 helps to get
pledges from different
chapters closer together
and to promote Greek
unity, said Loraine
Shipley, assistant to the
Greek advisor.

The point of Greek 101
is to meet other pledges,
because these are the
people with whom they
will spend the next four
years, according to
Shipley.

Groups consisting of
one or two pledges from
different chapters travel
from one balloon-deco-
rated door to another to
attend various seminars.
To the pledges, the pre-
sentations on alcohol and
sexual assault were the
most interesting.

The speaker on alco-
holism was definitely the
best, said the pledges of
Chi Omega. “He was
very informative and he
made things stick in your
mind,” said Kim
Gablehouse, a Chi
Omega pledge.

Green, a recovering
alcoholic himself, started
out as a football coach
and drug and alcohol
counselor at Westminster
College. Students
enjoyed his program so
much that, due to word
of mouth, Green now
speaks at 400 colleges a
year.

Green has said that his
motto is: “You don’t
need to be an alcoholic to
have a one-night prob-
lem.” His seminar focus-
es on responsible drink-

Pitt professor says tenure a//ows freedom to think

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

Without the tenure system, the univer-
sity of the 21st century cannot house a
free exchange of ideas, said an associate
professor of philosophy at Pitt, Tamara

I Horowitz.

“We couldn’t have the university as
we know it without tenure,” she said at a
workshop. “We couldn’t have people
speaking out on controversial issues.”

Horowitz spoke at a workshop
Thursday that addressed the question of
whether tenure will survive in the 21st
century.

Horowitz addressed a 1978 article
entitled “Tenure: A Conscientious
Objection,” in which the author, James
O’Toole, argues for the abolition of
tenure.

According to Horowitz, O’Toole
wrote that abolishing tenure would
allow more young people to enter acade-
mia positions and would give faculty
members the ﬂexibility to explore other
career options. Some argue that faculty
members remain in university positions
only because tenure offers them securi-

ty, she said. .

The article states that abolishing
tenure will not suppress intellectual
freedom. If a university fires a faculty
member for his/her radical views, the
professor could just go to another uni-
versity with the same radical views.

But Horowitz cited a case in the 1960s
when a radical math professor was fired.
He couldn’t get a job anywhere else in
the United States and had to leave the
country.

“So the argument that other universi-
ties will snap up the radical professor is
false,” she said. '

Tenure was designed to encourage
intellectual freedom, said Pitt Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Peter Koehler in
a telephone interview. It allows a faculty
member to speak out on controversial
issues, because it extends to the faculty
member a permanent contract, he said.

Others at the workshop pointed out the
faults of the tenure system.

“I think tenure will survive, but how
do we fix it?” said the associate dean of
Carnegie Mellon University. “What do
you do about people who are no longer
productive members of the communi-

ty?”

Many of the 12 workshop participants
echoed the fear that a professor with
tenure who loses his enthusiasm for his
job will cling to tenure like a “security
blanket,” and will have no incentive to
leave the university to pursue other
career options.

The faculty member may become dor-
mant and cease to take intellectual risks
in their research. This makes it difficult
for younger graduates to break into
academia positions.

Faculty who become intellectually
inactive after attaining tenure should be
pressured-to keep producing, Koehler
said. Faculty work should continue to be
reviewed, he said.

A faculty member is typically hired
into FAS at the position of assistant pro-
fessor. After a probationary period of
seven years, faculty are evaluated in
three areas —— teaching, research and
service.

Criteria vary from discipline to disci-
pline, Koehler said. But faculty in the
humanities are usually expected to pub-
lish a book. Their work is evaluated on

Tenure is then extended to
faculty who meet the depart-
ment’s standards.

It would be impossible to
abolish tenure because
the good faculty members
would go to a university
where tenure remained
intact, said Dean of FAS
Graduate Studies Mary Lou
Soffa, at the workshop. If
several universities at the
same time abolished
tenure, it might work, she
said.

pointed out that if a person gets
drunk every Friday and
Saturday night, then 104 out of
365 days are potential one-
night problems.

Most people are not addicted
to the alcohol but rather to the
excitement of partying, said
Green.

Speaker Marsha Guinsler
talked about relationships
between men and women.
Guinsler talked about the con-
troversial topic by involving
the audience in a he—said, she-

Besides the speakers, Greek

event, held in David Lawrence
Hall, featured tables filled with
hats, mugs, sweatshirts and any
other accessories that a
pledge’s new Greek letters
could be slapped onto.

Life Chain

‘From page 1

“I have killed two of my own
children,” he said. “I hate abor-
tion.”

While the people participating
in the Life Chain were on a mis-
sion to save lives, the pro-choice
people were on a mission to be
heard. With signs stating,
“Leave your rosaries off our
ovaries,” and “Use your voice,
vote for choice,” members of the
University of Pittsburgh’s
Campus Women’s Organization
and others protested the Life
Chain event. As the group
marched up and down the
streets, chants such as “What do
we want? Choice. When do we
want it? Now,” could be heard.

CW 0 Co-President Stephanie
Sudzina was one of several pro-
testers at yesterday’s event.
“We’re here to protect choice
and represent choice for all
women on campus.” ,

A Life Chain participant, Janet

Fox, disagreed with the pro-
choice protesting yet said they
have a right to their opinion.

“They can say what they
think, but I disagree with their
slogans. They have a choice of
whether or not to conceive,” Fox
said.

According to the Executive
Director of People Concerned
for the Unborn Helen Cindrich,
this is the fifth year Pittsburgh
has participated in the Life
Chain event. The demonstration
was originally started in 1987.
The Life Chain line in
Pittsburgh started at Children’s
Hospital on Forbes Avenue and
continued toward East Liberty.

A freshman at Pitt, Danny
Ball, heard protesters from his
room in the Towers and decided
to participate in the Life Chain.

“I feel sorry for [the pro-
choicers],” he said. “It’s not
right. I don’t think they under-
stand what they’re saying.”

here,” Brown said.

Brown and Haley both said
the University Times is not a
public relations newspaper that
is supposed to report on all
events at Pitt. “A lot of people
think we are an in—house organ,
but we have never functioned
that way,” Brown said. “The
Times has always had an inde-
pendent editorial policy.”

“It is considered a communi-
cations vehicle for the faculty
and staff, communicating about
events on campus. The purpose
is to report on structure and
research,” Haley said.

“The University Times staff
has always determined where
the stories are and what they are
going to be"about,” added
Brown.

Same-sex marriages are not
recognized in Pennsylvania, and
according to the Post-Gazette,
Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor wrote a letter to uni-
versity trustees explaining why
the Heinz Chapel was used for
the wedding.

The chapel is available for
use by Pitt faculty, staff, stu-
dents and alumni, in addition to
H.J. Heinz Co. employees,
according to O’Connor. One
participant in the wedding, Ken
Hall, meets the requirement of
alumni — he graduated from
the School of Social Work.

According to the Post-
Gazette, Haley said the historic
nature of the wedding ceremony
did not make a difference in the
decision not to run the story.

choice.” Those who blew
their car horns were cheered
and applauded.

“We like to show that we’re
here and that we’re correct in
our pro-choice position,” said
Scott Dolin, co-president of
Campus Women’s Organ iza-
tion. “We like to come and
voice our opinions.”

CWO members made up
the majority of the pro-choice
protesters, although several
members of Chatham’s
Feminist Collective and a
few people from the general
public also participated.

Dolin contacted Chatham
and other colleges in
Pittsburgh about the
protest because “abortion
isn’t just a Pitt campaign,” he
said. '

Most of the anti-abortion
protesters silently held up
signs and did not con-
front the vocal pro-choicers.
Only two anti-abortionists
used tactics similar to their
opponents.

“Pro-choice, it’s a lie!
Babies never choose to die!”

chanted Jessica Garris and
Marguerite Collins as the
pro—choice advocates yelled
louder to try to drown them
out.

“Sometimes you need to do
more [than silent protest],”
Garris said when the pro-
choicers moved away. “The
most important thing to
remember is that babies have
no voice.” '

The pro-choice groups are
expected when Life Chain is
planned, said Helen Cindrich,
executive director for People
Concerned for the Unborn
Child.

“They show up like this
every year,” Cindrich said.

After the hour-long protest,
the pro—choicers appeared
pleased with what they had
accomplished. I

“I think we did a good job
today,” said Stephanie
Sudzina, CWO co-president.
“I think we shook some
things up.”

“I’m really glad I came out
here,” said CWO member
Dorit Yaron, who i said
that it was her first protest.

with pie charts and compar-
isons of what percentage
maintenance expenses made
up of the total budget in 1990
and 1994, he said.

“The bare bones financial
statements which [are]
required by ‘law, ?which were
produced year after year, .
often didn’t give answers to
the kinds of questions that
faculty have,” Wion said.

According to Wion, the
committee has urged that
budget-related documents
become more meaningful in
relation to each other, Wion
said.

“Instead of apparently only
loosely related documents
that you can’t map onto the
agenda, we will be able to get
things that  make a little bit
better sense in . relation to
each other and then can be of
more use in key policy deci-
sions,” Wion said. ‘

These policy decisions
include those that relate to the
university’s academic goals,
strategies and overall
principles, as presented in the
long—range plan. One of the
goals is to “strengthen the
core units of the university -
The Arts and Science,
Medicine, Law, Engineering,
and Business,” according to a
booklet entitled “Toward the
21st Century Missions, Goals,
Strategies, and Evaluations.”

The booklet was released by
the provost’s office.

The long—range plan will be
presented along with Pitt’s
master space plan to the
board of trustees on Oct. 21.
Over the next six months, the
long—range plan will become
.more specific and prioritized
and will “attack some num-
bers,” Wion said. This will
affect next year’s budget, he
said.

Also at the meeting, the
committee unanimously elect-
ed William Madden to serve
as a pro—tempore member.

“Generally, pro—tempore
members are people who
have attended the meetings
and showed an interest in
budget policy,” Wion said at
the Sept. 16 Senate Budget
Policy Committee meeting.

NEW YORK e A majority of
the nation’s lawyers believe
that O.J. Simpson will be
acquitted of murdering his ex-
wife and a friend, according to
a poll to be published today.
The survey, which appears in
the current issue of the
National Law Journal, shows
that 61 percent of ‘lawyers think
the trial will end in not guilty
verdicts or a hung jury. Of
those, 22 percent believe
Simpson will be acquitted and
39 percent believe the jury will
not be able to reach a verdict.

Build shuttle shelters

The University of Pittsburgh transportation has improved in
the last couple of years, but there are still improvements to be
made. One suggestion of The Pitt News is to create shuttle shel-
ters. Many of the City of Pittsburgh bus stops have rain and
wind shelters. If PAT can protect us from the elements, then
why can’t Pitt? Students are often sitting outside the William
Pitt Union waiting for their shuttle. This is fine if it is a nice,
sunny, late-summer day. But when the rain is coming down or
the wind blowing, it would be nice to have some protection
from the elements. It would make it easier for students to identi-
fy where shuttle stops are. Building these shelters‘ would likely
be very easy to do and inexpensive (assuming the red tape can
be avoided), and would be a much greater improvement than a
campus clock.

Another needed improvement is more schedule information.
One can always get schedules in the union, but it would be con-
venient if they were available elsewhere. A permanent structure
in front of the union, next to the campus map would be a
desired improvement. Ideally, this structure would list all routes
and times as a convenient reference point for students.
Furthermore, route maps posted on the new shuttle shelters,
showing where and when the shuttles that stop there go, would
be very convenient for students. Also on general principle,
making route schedules more available on campus would be
greatly desirable.

These simple and inexpensive improvements would go a long
way toward making the university shuttle system more user-
friendly and would make getting around campus that much eas-

lgpeed limit should be 65

You are driving down the Ohio Turnpike, entering
Pennsylvania. The first thing you see is the “Welcome to
Pennsylvania, the Speed Limit is Still 55” sign. Then you are
“politely” informed of the triple-digit cost of speeding tickets.
Enough is enough. It is time for Pennsylvania to finally take a
step back from social repression and raise the speed limit to 65
miles per hour. V

Many states have entered the ‘90s and have raised their speed
limit to 65. There is no real reason for the speed limit to stay at
55. A 10-mile-an-hour increase would cut by almost 20 percent
the time required to travel from point A to point B.
Furthermore, studies have shown there is not a significant
increase in auto accidents when highway speed limits are high-
er. Most accidents occur at dangerous intersections rather than
on highways.

Ultimately, there is not a good enough reason for our state to
have a speed limitat 55. The de facto speed limit is basically
already 65. It is time for Pennsylvania to loosen up a little. For
our overly paternalistic state to limit our speed limit, thereby
slowing our lives down, is just plain wrong.

The role of ROTC on Pii'i's campus

wo weeks ago, while
some of us were sit-
ting discussing the

Renaissance, we heard martial
strains floating into the class
from the Cathedral lawn.
Being naturally curious, as stu-
dents ought to be, we ventured
down after class to find out
what was happening.

When we stepped out of the
door, we saw maybe30 ROTC
cadets in formations. There
were some officers milling
around in front of the forma-
tion. They were being
addressed by one of their supe-
riors, and they looked ready to
march off to Haiti or Bosnia or
some other world hot spot.

A friend, who is admittedly a
little to the left of Karl Marx,
said to me that she didn’t think
the university ought to be
training better killers. This was
a slightly‘ unnerving thought.
The military’s job, however, at
its basest level, is killing the
enemy (whomever our national
leaders in their infinite wisdom
decide that is). “Defending the
Constitution” sounds better,
but it is a euphemism. The uni-
versity (as an idea now) is
designed to promote under-
standing and attainment. The
military may promote attain-
ment, but its promotion of
understanding is something
akin to that of a Mafia Cappo.
They promote an understand-
ing of the American point of
view by blowing a few things
up, shooting some folks and,
sometimes, they even succeed.

Upon further reflection, it
seemed that if the ROTC was a
necessary evil, then the univer-
sity wasn’t living up to the sec-
ond part of the idea.
Specifically, it didn’t seem to
be promoting the attainment of
a higher form of killing.

For instance, why don’t Pitt
students hear the constant
cracking of riﬂes, the shouts of
close-order drills and see hand-
to-hand combat practice on the
Cathedral lawn? If Pitt is going

to be involved in the training
of better killers, then they
ought to do it expeditiously.
Set up bayonet dummies in
front of the William Pitt Union
and hold rappelling drills
down the Cathedral. With all
the helicopters bringing in
spare people parts for the hos-
pital or serious emergency
cases, who would notice the
added noise of air assault prac-

’ tice on various sites on cam-

pus? A practice assault on
Sutherland Hall would liven
up the old study breaks and
test the security Pitt has hired
to guard its dorms.

Well, it turns out that the
ROTC’s program is not
designed to turn out soldiers,
sailors and airmen per se. I
spoke with members of the
military (a sin for which my
dear friend the hippie—chick
will never forgive me) and
observed some of the groups
of cadets on campus. It seems
that, ideally, the ROTC pro-
gram is designed to train lead-
ers, not killers.

The cadets are supposed to
be students first. The concept
is that they develop discipline
through their education and
some ancillary exercises pro-
vided courtesy of the
Department of Defense.

Their first required military
training does not occur until
the summer between their
junior and senior years. They
are supposed to learn some-
thing besides how to plan ans
invasion. Sometimes, they
learn something the military
can apply directly, like engi-
neering. At other times, they
have something less directly
applicable to the function of
the army. There are few fine
arts majors, for example, but at
the same time, there are no
requirements that a cadet have
a specific major.

The first question that comes
to mind is: “Why aren’t the
military academies taking
charge of training the new offi-

cers?” It turns out that they
don’t produce enough officers
to fill the demand. Every year
more officers leave, one way
or another, than the service
academies grind out to fill
their place.

Actually, putting the future
military leaders in the universi-
ty setting makes more sense
than keeping them sequestered
in training camps. First, an
educa'ted"force'is' needed to be
more efficient, less costly and
less of a danger to itself. All of
those video game weapons
need someone competent to
use them, and you can’t draft
an army from video arcades.

Second, it helps the preven-
tion of the development of -a
warrior class. The last thing
this country needs is a group of
people who see themselves as
some sort of samurai class. It
keeps them in touch with their
civilian side, “that civilian

within all of us” to borrow -

support group jargon.

Finally, the cadets have to be
in an environment with
peaceniks, Lenny Bruce fans
and even socialists (yes, there
are some still left) so they are
exposed to more free thinking
than they would ever find in a
boot camp. Thus, they are
more likely to think things
over before sliding into a doc-
trinaire stance.

While the United States may
want an army that is possessed
of straight shooters, they can’t
all be grunts. The fact that they
aren’t is what prevents the
nonsense seen in other coun-
tries. There is no daily coup
d’etat in Washington. So,
while the military may make
some of us nervous, it’s better
to have them up close. This
way, we can keep a better eye
on them and even influence
them a little. If we don’t, then
it won’t be long before Big
Brother will be keeping his eye
on us.

nist for The Pitt News.

' ing the
Columnist Panthers a
Brady chance to win
Slater Saturday’s

game at
Louisville.

West fumbled twice in the
last six minutes of the game.
His first fumble was recovered
by the Cardinals at the Pitt 9
and led to the Louisville field
goal that made the final score
33-29.

Then with a little under three
minutes left in the game, West
fumbled again, this time after a
7-yard gain that would have
given Pitt a second-and-three
from its own 39, with plenty of
time left on the clock and all
three of its time outs remain-
mg.

‘‘I was the goat in this one,”
West said.

But first he had to be in posi-
tion to be a goat. If it weren’t
for Billy West, Pitt would have
never been in the game in the
first place.

West carried the ball 28

times for 158 yards and one

touchdown.

“Billy West made some out-
standing second efforts and
some wonderful cuts that
turned an occasional average-

looking play into a good one,”_

head coach Johnny Majors
said, finding no fault in his
workhorse.

Most of the rushes Majors
was referring to came in West’s
120-yard second half. Pitt
scored on four of its first five
possessions of the second half,
and West was an integral part
of each.

West answered any questions
about his explosiveness early
in the third quarter with a 51-
yard romp around right end,
getting knocked out of bounds
at the l-yard line. He scored on
the next play.

On the next series, West took
the ball on a sweep designed to
go left. Caught in the back-
field, West escaped ankle and
shirt tackles, reversed direction
and ran around right end for an
11-yard gain. Pitt scored its
second TD later in the drive.

On the next series, West
came up with his prettiest
move. Encountering a line-
backer on his way through the
hole, West cut hard right, leav-

For the first time in several

The Panthers, losers of their

Lady Panhrs weather BC's fast starts

Head coach Cindy Alvear
summed up the Lady Panthers’.

which was
Pitt’s Big
East vol-
1 e y b all
opener
Saturday

night at the Fitzgerald Field‘

House, perfectly.

“We win ugly sometimes,”
Alvear said, “and we won ugly
tonight.”

In each of the three games, Pitt
started off slowly, but turned it
on in the end. The Lady Panthers
(8-5) opened the first game
lethargically as they fell into a 5-
0 hole. Pitt rallied back to tie the
game 5-5 behind Jennie
Driscoll’s block to score the first
Big East point of the season.

After four lead changes and
several long volleys, Pitt pulled
off a 16-14 win. The Lady
Panthers went on to win the sec-
ond game 15-7 and the third 15-
11, in each of which Boston
College (9-7) had the early
advantage.

In the second game, Pitt
exchanged leads with BC before

going on an eight—point run to up
its lead to 14-6. And in the third
game, the Lady Panthers fell
behind 5-0 before they tied the
game 6-6.

“Athletics is a matter of confi-
dence, pride and spirit,” Bo-Stan
College coach Nadine Lilavois
said. “lt’s whoever wants it

“We take the lead then we give

East patsy, gave Pitt all it could
handle.

“They were very close,” out-
side hitter Laurie Fernandez said
of the match. “In fact, they were
nail-biters, especially the first
game.”

Fernandez did all she could do
off the bench to lift the Lady"
Panthers to victory. She led the
team in digs with 16, and had a
serving ace and a .500 attacking’
percentage.

“Laurie Fernandez came in
and did a phenomenal job in the
back row,” Alvear said.

“Personally, I thought I played
one of my better matches,”
Fernandez said.

Outside hitter Sara Mitchell
paved the way for Pitt as she led
the team with 13 kills and a .448
hitting percentage in 29 attempts.
She also had three aces.

The match also noted the
return of 5-foot-1 l-inch middle
hitter Driscoll, who previously
was injured. In her first game
back she had 12 kills and 13
digs, both second-best on the
team.

“Jennie has spurts,” Alvear
said. “She’s kind of doing the»
two steps forward and one step
back. She has some great days at
practice and other days she’s real
sore. She’s getting better, but it’s
a slow process.”

Soccer splits New England road trip

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

The see-saw season for the
Pitt soccer team continued this
weekend as the Panthers won
one and lost one on their Big
East road trip to New England.

On Friday night, the Panthers
(5-4 overall, 1-3 in the Big
East), who are currently ranked
10th in the Mid-Atlantic region,
were the victims of a 5-1
thumping at the hands of
Boston College (2-4-1, 1-1-1),
but they rebounded on Sunday
afternoon to beat Providence
(3-4, 0-3) 4-3 in overtime.

Against BC, the lone Pitt
goal was scored by sophomore
midfielder Matt Gray at the 64-
minute mark of the game.
Panther junior goalkeeper
Adam Spitzer was blitzed for
three goals in the first half.
Kimani Robinson scored twice
and had one assist, and Brian
Siracusa scored the third goal
of the half for the Eagles.

Weather conditions at the
cross country Bobcat
Invitational at Ohio
University were ideal for
spectators, but far too humid
for participants.

Distance coach Mark
Schwartz said conditions at
the Bobcat Invitational were
made tougher due to more
turns and construction near
the course.

“It was a different course
and the more turns made it
difficult,” Schwartz said.

For the Panthers, once
again it was Angie Martin and
Mike Umbleby leading their
respective teams.

For the Ohio U. squad,
which finished in first place in
both the men’s and women’s
division, "the ever present
home field advantage gave
them a favorable edge.

With that advantage plus
Ohio's first four women run-
ners finishing in the top six
places, the Pitt women ended
up with a strong second place
finish with 98 points.

The course may have both-
ered some, but sophomore
standout Martin ran the course
to her advantage.

“I liked the course,” Martin
said. “It was level and I don’t
like hills so it was easier for
me to adapt to it.” _

Martin’s second place finish
with a time of 18:33 led the
Panthers and trailed only
Debbie Brown from Ohio U.

“Angie never gave up, she
kept coming on [the leader],”

_ Schwartz said.

What impressed Schwartz
most was the running of
sophomore Stephanie
Ellsworth who placed 16th
with a time of 19:23.

“She got out good off of the
start which helped her,”
Schwartz said.

Right behind Ellsworth in
17th place was freshman
Stacey Anderson, who crossed
the finish line at 19:24.

“Stacey ran real well,”
Schwartz said. ‘

Described as a “surprise” by
Schwartz, freshman Amy
Francy took 19th place with a
personal best time of 19:28.

For the second time in two
weeks the men’s team lost to
the Akron Zips while placing
third overall.

The top three Panther run-
ners were Umbleby, Dennis
Kuntz and Ed Adamson who
fllllllshfld in the top seven over-
a .

“Mike Umbleby came in
here undefeated,” Schwartz
said. “Here he dueled Chris
England from Ohio U. They
dueled the whole way. It was
really exciting to watch and it
thrilled the crowd.”

Rugby
continues

a streak

By Michael Kovak
For The Pitt News

The Pitt rugby A team raised
its season record to 4-0 with a
26-18 victory over rival West
Virginia Saturday at
Morgantown.

Team captain Brian Vahosky
got Pitt rolling early in the first
half with a 35-meter run set up
by a J.D. Groff pass. A Sean
Tonkin conversion gave Pitt a
7-0 lead, which would not be
relinquished.

WVU quickly responded,
however, with a score, but the
conversion failed, narrowing
Pitt’s advantage to 7-5.

Tom Marsden, with a lot of
help from his teammates, bull-
dozed his way into the tri—zone
for the next Panther score. The
successful conversion put Pitt
ahead 14-5.

Momentum continued to
stay in— Pitt’s favor. Matt
Fleisman, playing in his first A
squad game, scored on an exit-
ing 45-meter run, dodging sev-
eral Mountaineer defenders
along the way.

“Hopefully, Matt will be
able to come up with a lot
more plays like that,” Pitt
rugby president Chris Fortin
said. '

After Fleisman’s score, Pitt
had a 21-5 lead, and the first
half came to a close.

As much as Pitt controlled
the first half, the opposite was
true in the second half.

“West Virginia was in our
zone for about 75 percent of
the second half. Our defense
bent, but it didn’t break. We
denied them quite a few times

‘in the second half,“ Fortin

said.

WVU began the second half
with a score to get within nine
at 21-12. The stingy Pitt
defense would only allow a
drop kick and a field goal for
the remainder of the game.

The only score inithe second
half for Pitt came from Brian
McNally, who was filling in
for Mike Barron. Tonkin
missed the conversion.

This is the second consecu-
tive year Pitt has defeated
WVU. The B squad was not as
fortunate though, losing 8-3.

Dave Jaeger, vice-president
of the rugby club, said, “The
forwards played really well.
We kept pushing them back.
The problem was that our
loose play was poor.

“Our backs are still inexperi-
enced, but they showed a lot of
promise. All in all, we could
have played a lot better.”

Pitt’s next opponent is Penn

' State this Saturday in State

College.

“We’re on a roll, and this is
a really big match for us,“
Fortin said of Pitt’s upcoming
match.

Panthers canTt locate opponents jugular

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

LOUISVILLE, Ky. —— Call it
what you want.

“You Can’t Teach An Old
Dog New Tricks” syndrome,
or “Old Habits Die Hard” dis-

ease, whatev-
er it is, the
Pitt football
team has it.

, And it won’t
go away.

“ I 11
their recent history, they’ve
seen more bad things than
good things, unfortunately,”
head coach Johnny Majors said
after the Panthers’ heartbreak-
ing 33-29 loss to Louisville.
“Winning one late, coming
back like we did, would have
been a real, real boost for us.”

However, what looked for a
moment like a boost, ended a
bust. And Saturday’s game
became just another example
of this team’s most glaring
shortcoming. The players just

don’t know how to win yet.

“The coaches were on the
sideline telling us to go for the
jugular,” offensive tackle
Reuben Brown said. “We just
didn’t go for it.”

It’s no wonder. In the 16
games of Majors’ second tour,
the Panthers have won four,
those coming against Southern
Mississippi, Rutgers, Temple
and Ohio University. The fact
is, this team doesn’t see the
jugular that often.

“It seems like we just Can’t
find a way to pull it out,”
Brown said.

Saturday’s game looked a lot
like the season opening 30-28
loss against Texas and last
year’s 24-21 near upset of
Syracuse. Those were games
where Pitt was able to fight to
stay in the game, but couldn’t
find a way to win.

“We can play with anybody,”
wide receiver Billy Davis said.
“But we haven’t beaten any-
body.”

becomes: How will it ever
learn to win?

“Under coach Majors and his
theories, you have to keep
pushing and prodding,” Davis
said. “Only through hard work
will you ever reap any bene-
fits.

“There’s no certain plays that
we can call, no magical play-
book out there,” Davis contin-
ued. “It’s just a matter of us
going out there and dedicating
ourselves to finding that win-
ning spirit again. This team
needs to find out what it feels
like to win and not just play.”

There’s no question that the
Panthers are playing better this
year. Through the first five
games last season, Pitt was
outscored 209-70. Through the
first five this year, Pitt has
closed that gap to 127-99. But
the team’s record through five
games remains the same as last
year at 1-4.

“You like to be coming clos-
er, to be in the games more like
we are this year,” Majors said.

11

“But you hate it for the kids, it
hurts. It hurts them very much.

“I don’t know the answer,
except that I’ve been through
this before,” Majors continued.
“It’s not new to me, taking
football programs that have
been down and had a hard time
winning. They play hard and
you certainly go back and
work with them, and we plan
to.”

The frustration that losing
brings was set in a long time
ago, and the players say that
the loss to Louisville hurt, but
not because they were so close
to winning.

“A loss is a loss,” linebacker
Jason Chavis said. “It’s feeling
so bad because we’ve had so
many.”

“I’ve been through this situa-
tion so many times before,”
Brown said. “I don’t like going
through it, but we just gotta
come in next week and get
ready for the next game.”

Pitt’s problems was it was with-
out the services of setter
Stephanie Dufresne, who was
out with an acute groin and hip
flexor pull. She didn’t practice
all week, but she is 90 percent
cleared to play.

Thus, it gave 1993 All-Big
East setter Annemarie Memagh a
chance to start at setter, some-
thing she hasn’t done since last
December due to injuries. She
finished the match with 45
assists.

“We were very disjointed
because of injuries,” Alvear said.
“We have been playing with a lot
of people out of position.

Consequently, “We just can’t
get a consistent six on the court
at the same time,” Alvear said.

Although disjointed, Pitt man-
aged to minimize its mistakes.
BC had 27 attacking errors
opposed to the Lady Panthers 16.
Also, Pitt’s .257 hitting percent
was .112 higher than the Eagles
measly .145 percentage. _

“I thought we played hard,”
Melanie Gustafson said, who had

10 digs and eight kills. “We just
weren’t doing the things we
needed to do. We were really
unorganized. We really wanted
to go out there and beat them.
We just got out of control.”

Alvear will take the win, but
she wasn’t pleased about the
team’s performance.

“I think it was a good effort,
but I don’t think we played well.
It wasn’t one of our better match-
es. I think we expended a lot of
energy without getting a lot of
results,” Alvear said.

With a much improving Big
East, Pitt will have to work a lit-
tle bit harder to obtain its seventh
consecutive conference title.

“We’ve been at a lull for a lit-
tle bit,” Fernandez said. “lt’s
time for us to climb back up that
hill again.”

Pitt Notes: The Lady Panthers
will take to the road this Tuesday
to play Akron, and then they will
host Providence on Friday.
Possibly Pitt’s toughest Big East
competition of the year will
come on Saturday when it hosts
Seton Hall.

with an assist to Porter. The
Friars had 12 shots on goal in
the first half compared to only
four for the Panthers.

Providence scored the next
two goals of the game, taking a
3-2 lead with less than 10 min-
utes left in regulation. The
Friars’ second goal of the game
was scored by senior Chris
Markgraf on an assist from
Jason Martin who also assisted
on Meyer’s goal. The third
Providence goal was scored by
junior Chaka Daley, a Canadian
native, on an assist from
Markgraf.

The equalizing goal for Pitt
came from the foot of Gorsin,
his first of the year, on an assist
from Prex, with 88:06 played
in the game. With no more
goals in the second half, over-
time was forced on the
Panthers and the Friars. This
was the second overtime in five
days for the Pitt squad.

Just 4:09 into the first OT
period, Astorino scored his sec-
ond goal of the game on Prex’s

second assist of the day.
Brodows and the Panther
defense kept Providence out of
the net for the rest of the game
and sealed a victory for Pitt.

Pitt finished the game with
only 11 shots compared to the
27 taken by the Friars. Friar
goalkeeper Mike Wright had
four saves on the day. With the
victory, Brodows’ record now
goes to 3-3.

The revolving door of Pitt
substitutions continued on
Sunday. Sophomore Steven
Hopper started his first game,
and juniors Josh Brooks and
Eric Kopay also saw action for
the Panthers.

Prex still leads the Panthers
with six goals and six assists
for a total of 18 points on the
season. Tied for second in
goals are Porter and Astorino
with three each. Astorino is
second in points with 10, and
Porter is third with eight.

Pitt takes a break from con-
ference play this Wednesday

' night as it hosts St. Francis

week’s game seems to be the
lone thing that drives the loss-
es out of the Panthers’ heads
and drives them onward.

“You feel the same every
-day after a loss,” Majors said.
“It feels the same on Sunday.
But it gets a little better on
Monday, once you got some-
thing else to look forward to
and you kinda want to get
your mind off the past.”

Down so much in their
recent history, the Panthers
keep looking for a payoff.

“We’re a scrappy team
looking for a win,” running
back Billy West said. “We just
got to go out and do it next
week at Syracuse.”

handed, facemask in the turf,
on his way to a 25-yard burst
down the right sideline.

Pitt’s third TD came later in
the drive.

West’s day could have been
bigger had he not been hit for
an unusually high 27 yards in
losses, most of that in the first
half.

“Our blocking in the first
half stunk,” Majors said.

West continues to lead the
Big East with 643 yards, aver-
aging 128.6 yards per game.

He first stepped up after
Curtis Martin got hurt in the
Ohio University game. He
rushed for 226 yards in that
game in little over two quar-
ters.

West has rushed for over
100 yards in every game he’s
played in place of Martin,
except Ohio State.

He’s the epitome of a tough
back. After slightly separating
his shoulder in the Ohio State
game, he came back and
rushed for over 100 yards

"against Boston College the

next week.

West has bounced back
from tough hits several times
this season. Sometimes it
takes him a minute or two to
get up, but he’s always in for
the next series.

Prior to the season; every-
one was talking about
Martin’s quest for number two
on Pitt’s all-time rushing list.
But considering Martin’s
limbo status, it may be West,
only a sophomore. who has
the shot. He’s already got 887
yards, and considering his
durability and average yards
per game, he’s well on his
way.

West is going to be a very
important part of Pitt’s
rebuilding over the next two
and a half seasons.

“As a young player, you
have to put [fumbles] behind
you,” West said. “Something
that when I wake up tomorrow
it’s just gotta be over.”

If West is a goat, Pitt ought
to be glad he’s grazing in Pitt
Stadium. *

Louisville answered when tail-
back Anthony Shelman, who
rushed for 180 yardsand scored
three touchdowns, leaped over
the top for a 1-yard score, giving
the Cardinals a 7-3 lead at the
9:40 mark into the second quar-
ter.

Merrick closed the gap with a
37-yard boot with 2:40 left in the
half.

With 14 seconds left,
Louisville’s David Akers kicked
the first of his two field goals, a
29-yarder, giving the Cardinals a
10-6 lead going into the half.

Pitt’s offense, which only
managed 138 yards in the first
half, looked like a completely
different team, scoring on its
ﬁrst three possessions of the sec-
ond half.

Pitt was able to spring running
back Billy West by using plays it
didn’t use at all in the ﬁrst half.

“We ran at least one running
play we hadn’t run in the first
half,” head coach Johnny Majors
said. “It was very helpful to us.”

West, who was held to 38
yards in the first two quarters,
exploded for 120 yards in the
second half, giving him 158 for
the day.

One play after he bounced a
routine run outside for a 51-yard
scamper, West muscled up the
middle for a 1-yard touchdown,
capping off a ﬁve-play, 80-yard
drive with 1:30 in the third quar-
ter.

Reacting off the offensive’s
performance, Pitt’s defense shut
down the Cardinals on their first
drive of the second half, setting
up another Panther score. This
time it was Chad Dukes pulling
his way to the end zone for a 1-
yard score. Merrick misﬁred on
the extra point, thus giving Pitt a
9-point lead.

Just when it looked like the
Panthers were about to run away
with the game, the defense start-
ed to make an average running
back look great.

Held to 21 yards in the first
half, Shelman exploded up the
middle, breaking a Denorse
Mosley tackle and galloping 85

yards for his second touchdown.

“The big run by Anthony
[Shelman] was unbelievable,”
said Louisville quarterback
Marty Lowe, who threw for a
career—high 271 yards. “It really
opened things up.”

But Pitt answered back on it’s
next possession. Sean Fitzgerald
connected with a wide-open
Chad Askew for a 16-yard
touchdown. '

Two minutes later, Cardinal
fullback Chris Fitzpatrick, bene-
ﬁtting from poor tackling, turned
a 5-yard reception into a 54-yard
touchdown strike from Lowe.

“1 was very surprised to see
that it happened the way it did,”
Fitzpatrick said. “Credit Marty
for getting the ball to me as
quickly as he did and for [receiv-
er] Johnny Bell for making key
blocks. It’s a pass play that has
to develop quickly in a timing
pattern, and it turned out per-
fect.”

Just when it seemed as if the
Panthers were going to complete
another successful drive in the
fourth quarter, a holding penalty

forced Pitt to settle on Merrick’s
final field goal, a 40-yarder,
which was also Pitt’s ﬁnal points
of the game. The Panthers led
29-24 with 11:47 left in the
game.

Sensing the victory, Lowe
threw over the outstretched arms
of Panther safety David Sumner
for a 49-yard bomb to freshman
receiver John Bell. J

“The long bomb and theyrun
that was 80'-yards long, I
shouldn’t of been playing peri-
od,” Sumner said. “I messed up.
I couldn’t do anything right. I
would say that I [screwed] up,
but I won’t say it.”

Three plays later, Louisville
took the lead for good as
Shelman scored his ﬁnal touch-
down on a 4-yarder, making it a
30-29 game.

The Panthers had ample
opportunities to regain the lead,
but key mistakes kept them from
obtaining their goal.

With 9:00 left in the game,
Fitzgerald was penalized 23
yards for intentional grounding.
Two plays later, on a third-and-

33 situation, a wide open Billy
Davis dropped a 40-yard
Fitzgerald pass.

“I just got a little greedy,”
Davis said, commenting on the
dropped pass. “When I got
greedy, I just wasn’t concentrat-
ing.”

Then at 6:30 left in the game,
West fumbled the ball on his
own 24-yard line. Louisville’s
Alan Campos recovered the ball
on the Panther 9-yard line, set-
ting up the final points of the
game on 22-yard Akers field
goal.

Pitt got another chance three
minutes later. But like last time,
West lost the ball. This time he
was stripped by Rico Clark, and
the ball was recovered by
Louisville’s Tony Bethel.

“I was the goat on that one,”
West said. “As a young player
you have to put them behind
you. When I wake up tomorrow,
it just got to be over. There is
nothing you can do about this
game. It hurts. You just got to
remember the feeling of losing
hurts.”

The Pitt News, Monday, October 3, 1994

Cross country

-From page 10

Umbleby finished behind
England with a time of 25:19.
According to Schwartz, it
came down to the finish, but
Umbleby still ran very well.

Sixth place belonged to
Kuntz who finished with a
time of 26:03. With a time of
26:14, Adamson finished in
seventh place.

“Ed Adamson did a great

job, this might have been his’

personal best,” Schwartz said.

“Ed has had some problems
with sore ankles and last week
he had an ingrown toenail
removed,” Schwartz said. “It’s
a painful thing to come back
from, but he still ran great.”

“Those three guys did a real-
ly good job.”

Filling out the last two spots
for the Panthers’ men’s team

were junior Mark Bufalini with
a time of 27:03 and freshman
Ryan Buckley at 27:10.

With both teams missing
starters as well as leaders, the
progress of the track squad has
been impressive. For the

 

women, who have finished
second in their last two meets,
their chance to gain a first
place finish will come against
St. Francis on Oct. 15.

The men will have the same
opportunity at St. Francis.

The Pitt News, Monday, October 3, 1994

e’re looking for people who
ook at this glass and say:

“There's gotta be ot
glasses of waten”

We need people capable of going
beyond half-full or half—empty
thinking. People who see subtleties.
Who are quite frankly bored by easy
answers and off-the-shelf solutions.

People who are constantly
challenging their own thinking and
are thirsty for new ideas and
knowledge.

You'll have a degree from a top
school. Getting ajob won't really be
an issue. The question is: which job?
Which industry?

You don't want to get locked
into one area and then discover
three to five years from now that you
don't like it. By then you've invested
too much.
