Republican Committee endorses Ridge

By Randy Knapick
staff Writer

HARRISBURG —— At 3:30 a.m. Saturday,
before many students had drawn their
Friday evening to a close, Pitt’s College
Republicans departed for the Republican
State Committee meeting in Harrisburg “to
voice opposition to a candidate endorse-
ment during [the gubernatorial] primary,”
CR President Eric Lurie said.

During Saturday’s meeting, the committee
debated whether or not to officially endorse
a candidate for the Pennsylvania gubernato-

rial primary on May 10.

The debate was a showdown between
supporters of Tom Ridge, who had the
greatest support within the delegation, and
supporters of the four other gubernatorial
candidates, Pennsylvania Attorney General
Ernie Preate Jr., Philadelphia businessper-
son Sam Katz, state Senator Mike Fisher and
state Sen. Earl Baker, all of whom favor an
open primary without an endorsement.

“This is simply a matter of people who
don’t have the votes  trying to stop Tom
Ridge,” Pennsylvania state Representative
Bud Shuster said.

When the question was opened to the
floor, some of the delegates voiced support
for the endorsement.

A delegate from Montgomery County
said, "‘It’s important for those of us in lead-
ership in the Republican Party to give
Republican voters of this commonwealth
our opinions as to our best and most elec-
table candidate.”

Other delegates said an open primary
would cause divisions within the party,
hurting its chances of victory in the elec-
tion.

The Student Environmental
Action Coalition got a chance to
reach out to area students inter-
ested in environmental activism
Saturday.

SEAC held a conference
Saturday afternoon at the
Community College of
Allegheny County to educate

area high school and university
students on how to start an
environmental activist group at
their school.

SEAC members said they
were happy about the way the
conference went.

“I think it was very successful.
I believe we’ve made many
connections to help each other
and reach common goals in
order to preserve the planet,”

said SEAC member Mia Manion.

Guests at the conference said
they found it helpful in organiz-
ing environmental issues.

“When we discussed things,
the issues became a little more
clear,” said Christine Hamer, a
student at CCAC.

The conference started with a
complimentary breakfast pro-
vided by Schwartz’s Bagels in
Oakland. Then the conference

was divided into five different
workshops, with each one last-
ing an hour. The workshops
dealt with different environ-
mental and educational issues.

shop educated students on how
to start new groups.

“Lori jaciela led the group.
What she did was give specific
points on how to start a group

As the search for Pitt's
new provost continues,
Student Government“
Board announced its
plans Thursday for stu-
dent representation on
the search committee.

SGB is currently taking
applications for an
undergraduate represen-
tative on the committee.
Board members Chris
Fedeh and Andy
Wuertele said the posi-
tion will be open to any
student able to put a lot
of time into the job.

“We’re looking for
someone whois going to
be willing to do a lot of
hard work in catching up
on all the applications
that have been taken 
and who has a concern
about the academics at
the university,” Fedeli
said.

According to Fedeli,
the search committee is
currently reviewing over
1()O applicants for the
provost job. Fedeli said
the committee will soon
try to narrow down the
field for interviews.
“Hopefully they’ll be able
to make a recommenda-

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, February 14, 1994 i
Air Force ROTC sponsorsfooa’ drive

By Bruce DeBroff
For Tbe Pitt News

Hunger is a problem which
continues to plague the less for-
tunate of our city, but with this
month’s food drive run by the
Arnold Air Society, this problem
is beginning to be helped.

This is just one of many activi-
ties which this national hon-
orary, professional service orga-
nization does to help further the
goals of the Air Force ROTC
program at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Pitt’s branch of the AAS,

known as the Salzarulo
Squadron, in conjunction with
Carnegie Mellon University’s
branch, is mounting an assault
against hunger.
' Cadet First Lieutenant Steve
Schwartz, public relations direc-
tor of Carnegie Mellon’s branch
of the AAS, said the AAS is not
only a professional service orga-
nization, but one that “cares
about problems in the commu-
nity.

his food drive is just one of
manv continuing efforts in
which the AAS has been proud
to sponsor,” he said.

“Even though this food drive
is not an annual event, we have
great enthusiasm for its success.
With help from the students at
both Pitt and CMU, this fight
against hunger can be an ongo-
ing project,” Schwartz said.

Air Force ROTC Cadet Major
Jose Aragon, a junior at CMU,
heads both the Pitt and CMU
branches of the AAS.

“We’re really excited about
this food drive,” Aragon
said. “We are working in
conjunction with the United
Way to find other organizations
besides food banks who can
benefit from our current
efforts.”

Food drives aren’t the only
events that the AAS sponsors.
Previous efforts have included
clothing drives for the needy
and one of their more hands-on
projects, a volunteer program
with Pittsburgh’s Veterans
Affairs Hospital. “This is a
favorite ongoing project which
we enjoy,” Schwartz said.

In the near future, the AAS
will sponsor a 5K run, and will
possibly run another clothing
drive at the end of March.

Collection boxes will be avail-
able at various locations around
the Pitt and CMU campuses to
aid the food drive.

Locations at Pitt will include
the Towers Lobby, Sutherland
Hall and the 29th floor of the
Cathedral of Learning. Boxes at
CMU will be located at Donner
Hall, Moorewood Gardens,
Skibo Hall and the Air Force
ROTC department on the
ground floor of Hamberg Hall.
Acceptable foods include

canned goods and all other
non—perishables.

The food drive will continue
until the end of February.

Hindu Student Council celebrates barvest festival

By Bruce DeBroff
For Ibe Pitt News

“Happy Pongal” was the
greeting this weekend by
Pittsburgh’s Hindu Student
Council. Pongal/Makara
Sankranti, the Indian Harvest
Festival, brought a large show-
ing this past Saturday night in
the William Pitt Union
Ballroom.

All across India this week,
people are giving thanks to
Surya Pooja, the Indian sun
god, who is the nourisher of all

life on Earth. At this time of
year, Poojas, or religious rituals,
are performed to honor and
give thanks for a bountiful har-
vest.

The HSC is a national forum
which provides opportunities
to learn about Hindu heritage,
values and the universal ideals
of Hindu Dharma. Any action
that sustains growth and pro-
motes harmony is considered
Dharma.

“Our chapter here at Pitt is
a mixture of both under-
grad and graduate students,

not only from Pitt but
from Carnegie Mellon as
well,” said Srikant Mooker-
jee, one of the founding mem-
bers of the HSC of Pittsburgh
and a graduate student here at
Pitt.

Mookerjee also said, “Our
purpose is not only to educate
ourselves, but to get non-
Hindus to come and learn about
our culture.

According to CMU graduate
student Abhishek Parekh, the
HSC is trying to bring aware-
ness through education. Parekh

stressed the fact that the HSC is
not strictly a religious organiza-
tion, and he would like to see
more non-Hindus participate in
its functions.

After a speech welcoming
everyone to the festival and
describing Pongal/Makara
Sankranti, Parekh introduced a
priest from the Jain Temple, one
of the two Hindu temples in
Pittsburgh.

ty,” he said.

The Deep Ecology
workshop was based on
a book by John Seeds.

“Deep Ecology is a phi-
losophy that begins to
break down the mental
separation between
humans and animals. The
workshop was about
each person’s philosophi-
cal View of the environ-

- ment.” member Matt
Peters said.

SEAC also sponsored a
Workshop for The Greens
Rap, a political environ-
mental activist group, led
by Debbie Lorz.

“I told the history of
the Green Party U.S.A.
and told a little bit about
the political force that the
Greens have played in
the Il.S.A. and Europe,"
Lorz said.

The information and
network exchange edu-
cated students on nation-
al electronic mail and
other ways that environ-
mentalists might commu-
nicate with each other.

After the conference,
SEAC held an open social
in Dining Room A of the
William Pitt Union.
Member Josh Knauer said
SEAC had arranged for
bands to play.

“It’s kind of a coffee-
house setting. We had
the band Soaz and a local
musician, John Farley,
play. They are both very
supportive of SEAC,” he
said.

Knauer said he would
like to see the education-
al conferences happen
more frequently.

should have these more
times a year. It definitely

Those who opposed the
endorsement cited the current
public disgust with insider poli-
tics, and urged the party to let
the Republican voters decide
who is the best candidate.

An endorsement would “go
against the grain” of current
political trends, a Cambria
County delegate said.

A Lancaster County delegate
said the delegates “were elected
to use wisdom.

“In this instance, wisdom calls
for an open primary,” he said.

In addition, opponents of the
endorsement cited the
Democratic Party’s decision to
hold an open primary this year.

When the debate ended, the
delegation voted in favor of
endorsement, 175-110, with
three abstentions.

Ridge supporters burst into
cheers as soon as the vote was
tallied.

While Ridge began his accep-

tance speech, the other candi— .

dates reacted to the vote outside
of the ballroom where the meet-
ing was held.

“The political bosses hand-
picked him,” Preate said, while
cheering from Ridge supporters
could be heard from within the
ballroom.

“There’s no question here that
this is an attempt by the political
bosses to try once again to
impose their will on the elec-
torate. It has not worked in the
past and it will not work again.”

“The mood of thepeople
today is one of openness and
involvement,” Baker said. “An
endorsement does not mean
much when it is closely contest-
ed.”

“After 12 years of being a
Washington insider, after two
years of applying those insider
skills to Pennsylvania politics,
spending $1.5 million i-n PAC
money, Tom Ridge can now
wear the mantle of machine
politician,” Katz said.

“This is exactly what I had
expected him to do, and I’m
delighted that he’s doing it,” he
said.

. After giving his acceptance 1

speech, Ridge replied, “Sam
Katz is a very good and effec-
tive deal-maker,” and cannot
consider himself a political out-
sider. '

In response to receiving the
party endorsement, Ridge said
 group of Republicans who
know the candidates best 
have made a choice.

“This builds momentum,” he
said. “I am proud to have the
endorsement of my party.”

Ridge said the election is not
locked away just because he
has secured the party’s endorse-
ment. I

“There’s still a lot of ground to
be covered, and a lot of other
votes to be obtained,” he said.

Preate accused Ridge of polit-
ical deal—making and job threats
to secure the endorsement.

“There were threats on peo-
ple’s jobs, enormous arm-twist-
ing and political deals were
made. They’ll all start to come
out,” Preate said.

“That’s the way you’ve got to

to have everything ironed out

hugging later.” According to
Wilson, men try to hug first
and fight later.

Fourth, he said to learn to
say “I’m sorry.” “My Dad
never said it — he was always
too proud to ever say it.
[Sometimes] I’ll be trapped in
my bedroom for hours
because I can’t say ‘I’m sorry’
to Candy.”

In that sameffvein, Wilson
appealed to the men in the
audience to be more commu-
nicative.

“When I come home from
work, my mind is wiped out.
Even though I don’t want to, I
encourage her lCandyl by
talking.

“Use as many details as pos-

sible. ‘I woke up at 6:10 in the
morning. I used Suave condi-
tioner, then put one-quarter
of a teaspoon of sugar in my
coffee,”’ he said in jest: He
stressed the fact that listening
is also a major part of commu-
nication.

Fifth, he said to use ‘I’ state-
ments, which describe your
own actions or feelings, rather
than ‘you’ statements, and
never generalize. “[Alwaysl
consider the person more
important than the problem.”

Finally, save special things,
especially words, until they
mean something.

“Words like ‘love’  I had
never sent red roses to any-
one except Candy. Wait until
someone’s really special and
you'll be glad that you wait-
ed.”

According to Wilson,
Webster’s definition of love is
an “emotional attraction."
“How do you know when
you’re really in love?  I don’t
think it has to do with an
emotion. It is a commitment
of my will  A lot of times it
isn’t easy [staying with a loved
one], but you have to choose
to love her.”

“I’ve heard similar talks,”
said Steve Satterfield, a junior
at the Pittsburgh Seminary,
“but he seemed to have a
grasp on it. A lot of personal
stories helped [the aucliencel
to get into it.”

“I thought it was really
good. A lot of it was general;
it’s good to hear the differ-
ences. I’ll keep some of i_t in
mind,” said Pitt alumni
Andrew Shissler.

allowed to appoint only one
student to the search commit-
tee to represent Pitt’s approxi-
mately 13,000 undergraduate
students. “We don’t have a
choice — we’re only allowed
one lrepresentativel,” Pasquale
said. “The committee is large
enough as it is, and we were
only allowed to make one
appointment.”

Fecleli said one student rep-
resentative on the search com-
mittee should be sufficient. “I
think one person who’s will-
ing to put in the time and

effort is enough,” he said.

“We’re going to have to be
very careful to find someone
who can adequately represent
a lot of students’ concerns,”
Wuertele said.

In other SGB activity,
Pasquale said he submitted
details regarding SGB’s stu-
dent activities fee proposal to
Senate Council last Monday.

“I welcomed questions from
concerned faculty,” Pasquale
said. “However, none of them
had any questions, so I
assume that means they want
a student fee increase too.”

Pasquale said he notified
Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs William Harmon that
SGB will now submit the fee
proposal and documentation
to Director of Student

Activities Joseph Cavalla.
Additionally, Pasquale said
Pitt’s College of General
Studies Student Government
Council and the Graduate and
Professional Student
Association will soon be doing
likewise.

In other SGB business:

-Board member Deena
Buchanan said she is working
on implementing a financial
aid seminar with Betsy Porter,
director of Pitt’s Admissions
and Financial Aid office.

“The seminar would explain
the filing process and answer
any questions students might
have concerning their finan-
cial aid forms,” Buchanan said.
“Hopefully, it will alleviate
[questions] some students
would have concerning the

new changes in the process.”

0Board member Elizabeth
Mania said she is working with
Campus Women’s
Organization co—President
Shira Hassan on organizing an
updated self—defense seminar
for members of the Pitt com-
munity, tentatively scheduled
for March 30.

“It will be like no other self-
defense program ever present-
ed at Pitt,” Mania said. “It will
focus on empowerment and
overcoming the ‘freeze’
response people have when
they’re attacked.”

Mania also reminded stu-
dent organizations to submit
their information for March’s
SGBrief events guide, which
will appear in The Pitt News
by Feb. 20.

Ridge. .

With that in mind, Ridge said
the call for an open primary in
this election is unusual.

However, U.S. Senator Arlen
Specter called the endorsement
“orchestrated from the begin-
ning.” ’ ,

Seven years ago, the
Reptibliean ‘ Party had another
very competitive primary elec-
tion, said Earl Baker, a former
chair of the Republican State
Committee. E

“It was a campaign focused
on issues, not personality,”
he said. “It was very competi-
tive, but when it was all
over, everyonelshooki hands

and got back together. I’m

afraid that might not happen
this time.”

Among the attending College’

Republicans, who were invited
by the Preate, Fisher and Baker
campaigns to lobby at the
meeting against an endorse-
ment, was a “general consensus
of opposition to endorsing
a candidate instead of an
open primary,” according to
Lurie. V

Despite the party endorse-
ment, the gubernatorial candi-
dates do not consider the race
decided.

“In terms of name identifica-
tion and money, Ernie Preate is
the candidate to beat,” Baker
said.

In a Feb. 10 poll by The
Pbilctdelp/9z'a Daily News, Ernie

Preate led in state-wide na,me_._ .

recognition, 69”" percent, with a
39 percent favorable rating
among those who recognized
him. ,

Ridge, who was third in state-
wide name recognition, 25 per-
cent, had a 40 percent favorable
opinion rating among those
who know him.

Ridge said as governor
he would cut taxes to promote
economic growth, break up
the Department of Environ-
mental Resources into two dis-
tinct departments and seek
“truth in sentencing” of crimi-
nals.

In education, Ridge wants to
eliminate the “Harrisburg-
knows-best” attitude, and
replace it with a “parents-know-
best” attitude.

He also wants to “put
Pennsylvania’s budget on a
diet.”

“We’re going to take the
weight off and keep it off,”
Ridge said.

Preate does not see Ridge’s
endorsement as a blow to his
campaign.

“I am the independent
Republican candidate. I never
even tried to get the endorse-
ment. I’ve said for years I want
to let the people decide. I trust
the voters,” he said.

“Obviously, some people
don’t trust the voters. They
want to force their will onto
the voter’s ‘minds,” Preate
said.

“The election is not deter-
mined “on Feb. 12. It’s deter-
mined on May 10,” he said.

When the candidates debate
each other face—to—face, Preate
said, “The distinctions between
us are going to be clear.”

“I think [the College

Republicans] were very success-
ful today in our purpose of
doing down  voicing our con-
cern about the direction of the
party in terms of endorsing a
candidate during the primary,”
Eric Lurie said.

“We were visible, we got
some television coverage,” he
said.

“It has been an enjoyable
trip,” he said. We’re very grate-
ful to the Preate, Fisher and
Baker campaigns for donating
the beautiful bus.

“The fact that the ‘Preate
Express’ was donated exclusive-
ly to Pitt’s College Republicans
really goes to show what a
viable force Pitt’s CR5 have
become.”

The College Republicans will
not endorse any candidates
before the primary.

That decision “is left com-
pletely up to members,” Lurie
said.

“Whoever wins this primary,
the College Republicans will
fully support that candidate 
and make sure that candidate
becomes our next governor,”
Lurie said.

Fre ze Harding coverage
The 1994 W/inter Olympic Games have begun. Yet,
instead of hearing about how our athletes are doing,
this country is caught up in a controversy which
should have been avoided. Now that the games have
begun, it should be placed on the back burner in order
not to detract from the spirit of the Olympic Games.

The controversy in question is of course the Nancy
Kerrigan/Tonya Harding debacle. This is a sad case of
attention being focused away from important issues
and the true nature of an important event. Instead of
hearing analysis by former Olympians and coaches,
audiences must hear legal analysis from an army of
lawyers representing athletes who are supposed to be
on the same team. The United States should have a
unified team. But if this is not possible, the press cov-
erage should not focus on the divisions in the overall
team, but should pay attention to how well the team is
performing.

This case has captured more media attention than it
rightly deserves. The front page headline of the Sunday
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reads: “Tonya will skate.” This
story takes front—page prominence, while opening cere-
mony proceedings are relegated to the third page of
the sports sections. The front page apparently is not
enough attention paid to this, as the first page of the
sports section also features further coverage. Where
does it end? How long must other athletes be denied
their due coverage because of something another ath-
lete may or may not have done?

During televised coverage of the men’s hockey game,

the news media continued to bring this event to the
limelight by repeatedly focusing on Nancy Kerrigan as
she sat watching the game. This steals from the hard
work and dedication which brought the men on the
hockey team to this event.
- Among other athletes who lose out from this compe-
tition are other skaters whose labors, dedication, and
talent rival, if not exceed, the abilities of Kerrigan and
Harding. Among them is Dan Jansen, the speed skater
who will attempt to win his first medal in this
Olympics and who shows promise for making a
stronger performance than in his previous Games. In
the last two Olympic Games, Jansen lost family mem-
bers immediately before competing. Although starting
beautifully, he fell both times. His story merits as much
attention as the Kerrigan/Harding case. Another such
athlete is Bonnie Blair, another speed skater favored to
win the gold.

This example of misplaced focus hurts sports fans in
this country who must search for actual sports cover-
age in the sea of various views about what either
skater (Kerrigan or Harding) had for breakfast. It is
time to put this issue‘ to rest and view the Olympics
through the lens of athletic competition in the Games,
not legal wrangling in the law courts.

X-men promote tolerance, peace

The basic premise of the show is the philoso-
phy of tolerance. The storyline is set in an
America just like our own, with one exception: a
new minority group has recently arisen, a group
of “mutants” who have been born with some
random genetic characteristic that causes them to
be labeled as inhuman (for example, blue fur,
telepathy or super-hard metallic skin). The X-
Men are a small team of these mutants who have

banded together to champion the cause of peace

between mutants and ordinary humans.

Dr. Henry McCoy, is arrested for destroying gov-
ernment records. Although McCoy could easily
break out of prison with his superhuman
strength, he chooses instead to stand trial, speak
out for his people through the judicial process
and follow the decision of the jury, whatever it
may be. Children watching this learn to respect
the law, but to voice their opinions as well.
Finally, the show tells children that violence is
no solution to problems. The X-Men are depict-
ed as ordinary people who happen to have been

Although some have claimed
the show promotes violence, I
beg to differ, the show in fact,
promotes understanding and
tolerance.

Segal

born with extraordinary abilities.
All they want is to be able to live
their lives in peace. However,
they are forced to fight by people
(mutants and humans alike) who

The parallel is drawn quite
clearly between these fictional mutants and the
persecuted minorities of the real world. Hate
groups arise, trying to legitimize themselves as
“Friends of Humanity” but actually work under
an agenda to violently rid the world of all
mutants. They hold rallies and print anti—mutant
propaganda, hurling such epithets as “freak” and
“genetic trash.” In every way, they mirror real-
life organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan.
Thus the show portrays hatred and narrow-
mindedness as enemies which should be fought.

In her column in The Pitt News on Tuesday,
Emily Stiger criticized today’s television cartoons
for encouraging violence in children. Among the
shows Stiger speciﬁcally singled out as bad inﬂu-
ences, she included “those X-Men (whomever
they are).”

While I can certainly sympathize with her nos-
talgia for the Flintstones and Charlie Brown, it is
a shame that Stiger did not take the time to
research her material a little more thoroughly.
She might have discovered that she was con-
demning a show she should have been praising.
X-Men, based on the Marvel comic book of the
same name, is unique in its intelligent, responsi-
ble presentation of real social issues.

The X-Men themselves consist of both females
and males; blacks, whites, and Asians; the young
and the old; Southern Americans, Northern
Americans and foreigners. In this way, the show
teaches children tolerance not only indirectly
through the fictional human/mutant relationship,
but directly through the cooperative actions of
these real human groups.

X-Men also encourages civic responsibility.
The very first episode of the show last season set
up a long-standing subplot in which the team
takes a stand against a U.S. Senator who tries to
enact a law requiring all mutants in the country
to register themselves with a special government
organization which would “keep tabs on them.”
The X-Men go to extreme lengths in fighting this
unconstitutional act. Eventually, one of the team,

| _.~1\<~>|\\ ;. 2.3 _)'.'.7

\.

seek to deprive them of that right
to peace. In every case, the X-Men do not seek
violence, but do try to protect others from it.
The one team member who does seem to relish
fighting, Logan, is portrayed as a man unable to
satisfactorily cope with his pent-up anger.
VVhenever he gives in to his violent urges, the
other X—Men express their displeasure.

To further illustrate the intelligent, socially con-
scious tone of the series, here are a few brief
synopses of typical episodes:

.“The Cure” — A scientist claims to have dis-
covered a process that turns mutants into ordi-
nary humans. The X-Men and other mutants
must therefore resolve the conflict between their
pride in who they are and their desire to be nor-
mal.

“Mojovision” -- The X-Men are abducted to an
alien world whose decadent rulers use mindless
television violence to keep the population
enslaved and docile.

“Days of Future Past” — A mutant from 25
years-in the future travels back through time to
change history so that mutants will not be
placed in concentration camps and exterminat-
ed.

The underlying theme of these episodes is
that, while there are many differences among the
people of Earth, the differences are not as
important as the similarities. People might be
mutants, non—mutants, whites, blacks, Jews,
Catholics, males or females — but they should
respect and appreciate these differences while
celebrating the fact that they are all human
beings.

Hopefully, Stiger and others who dismiss X-
Men as a mere shoot-’em-up will take another
look at it.

And if all they see are funny-lpoking people in
spandex suits running around and punching
each other, then they aren’t getting the message
of the show — a message we should be glad
children are receiving.

THE PI'IT E528‘ MONDAY: FEBRUARY 14. 1224 2
Despite Writer’ s block, Writer ﬁnds nothing to Write about

I know what you’re thinking. How
can I write a column about nothing?
Well, you see, I’m suffering from
writer’s block. I’ve been sort of rolling
with column ideas since the beginning
of the year, but I’ve fallen upon a bit of

. a dry spell.

I’m a very opinionated fellow, and my
self—proclaimed “farewell tour” has
given me a golden opportunity to
express some of my often repressed
feelings about things before I enter the
world beyond. Whether you realize it or
not, college may be one of the last
opportunities all of us will get to
express ourselves and have anyone
even bother to listen, or if we’re lucky,
care. Oh, say it ain’t so, Dave. I’m sorry
kids. I speaketh the truth.

Do you know what college is for? T 0
get an education so that you can go out
into the world and make more money
than your parents? Nope, although I
don’t doubt that more than a handful of
you are here for just that reason.
College is exactly what it claims to be:
higher education. The key to a sound
college education is enlightenment. If

you leave college without having been
enlightened, then you or your parents
didn’t get their money’s worth.

Let me explain. You see, we all grow
up in different environments, whether
they’re due to nurturing or geography.
So we all come to different universities

world beyond ends up being a place
where repression of feelings is the
norm, not the exception.

In fact, for many students here, col-
lege has become more of a practice ses-
sion for that world than a place to rel-
ish before that world. What is a good

(in this case, Pitt) with
our often diverse, and
in many cases, incor-
rect perceptions of

Dave Matta

measuring stick
of whether you
have become
enlightened or

the world we live in.

_College is perhaps the one arena in

which everyone is exposed to more or
less the same environments in an effort
to teach those who don’t know the
things that they don’t know. And I’m
not talking about organic chemistry
(although for some students, that’s very
important, and I’m receptive to that).
One of the bonuses of such an institu-
tion is that we’re all given a chance to
express ourselves, even when we’re
wrqng. It’s»not like that out there. Enjoy
it. Milk it for all ’ it’s worth.
Unfortunately, because so many people
squeak through the college experience
without ever being enlightened, the

not? It’s quite
simple, really. You just know. You feel
it (“feel” being the operative word). If
you don’t know, then it’s pretty safe to
say that you haven’t been enlightened.

I don’t know if I’m doing a good job
of expressing myself right now. But I
know that there are a few of you out
there who know what I’m trying to say,
and some of you even feel it.
Sometimes when I’m walking among
you during my meanderings around
campus, I feel brilliance and enlighten-
ment, occasionally coming from unlike-
ly sources. That’s the best kind.

But then you know what happens
more often than not? Just when you’re

hitting your stride, you say something
like, “Did you hear what she said about
what he did when he was doing that
with her and did you see what she was
wearing when he did it?”

It takes hours of watching public tele-
vision without interruption to counteract
the negative effects of brushes with
idiocy like that.

You don’t have to be and act stupid
to get along with others. As far as I’m
concerned, if you’re stupid or acting
that way, then you shouldn’t get along
with anyone. The social success of peo-
ple should be measured by how well
they express themselves and be them-
selves, not by how well they repress
themselves.

Well, I think I’m finished for now.
Hopefully, there will be more focused
issues discussed intelligently and elo-
quently in my future columns.

The sad part is, I’m afraid, that many
of you probably still think that this was
a column about nothing. I guess I’m in
for another night of PBS.

Blade community needs more love

The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad, leader of the
Nation of Islam, put forth a
doctrine which asserted “a
nation can rise no higher
than its woman.”

Black students on cam-
pus should consider this,
as men and women, and
think about the implica-
tions this has for the acad-
emic and social success we
have while we are at the
university.

It would not be unsafe
to assume that in the black
nation, many of us were
raised within the Christian
faith. Yet, there are some
Black people who live
their lives as Muslims,
Jews, Rastafarians,
Nubians, adherents of tra-
ditional African religions
such as the Yoruba faith
and other ways of life.

What are the meanings
of these faiths, and what
does this have to do with
what the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad said about
our mothers and sisters, in
relation to the black
nation?

The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad also asserted
that the basis of communi-
ty development begins
with self.

We must know that
when the human being
was formed, from the ele-
ments of earth, sky and
sea, the‘ creator molded
this being into the form
of the black woman and
man.

In the Book of Genesis,"

of the The Torah and the
Holy Bible, it reads, “so
God created man in his
own image, in the image
of God created He him;
male and female created
He them.”

This should show the
black nation that our bod-
ies are more than mere
flesh and bone. Rather,

" according to our spiritual
ideals, within us is the

workplace of the creator
himself. As the first human
beings to walk“ the face of
the Earth, we must show
ultimate respect for this
divine reality.

When we pollute our-
selves with alcohol, ciga-
rettes or other such filths,
which only shorten our life
span, we are disrespecting
the creator. When weeat

unhealthily, one. l_1S€_é toxins 
which disrupt our God-"

given gift to bear children,

Oscar
Eybers

 

‘we are disrespecting the

creator.

Furthermore, when a sis-
ter sees her body as noth-
ing more than ﬂesh, and a
brother does the same, this
is evidence of how
detached from the Creator
we have become. Such
thinking justifies rape,
molestation and physical
abuse. We should never
allow ourselves to reach

" this point.

The Honorable Minister
Louis Farrakhan once said
that the womb of our sis-
ters is the workplace of
God.

As a family, the black
nation must come to mutu-
al respect within the con-
fines of our highest morals
and beliefs. ‘

If a brother lays his hand
upon a sister in a harmful
manner, which she does
not desire, he should want

‘ to reckon with the campus

police before he reckons
with us as a family. Our
judgement and punishment
should be greater.

In the same token, sisters
must remember that their
beauty supersedes the
finest of all sisters.

Because of this, we as a

major.

family should not dress in
a manner which exposes
all our bodily parts for the
whole University of
Pittsburgh to see.

Sisters must remember
that, though they are free
to dress as they wish, there
are those on campus who
desire nothing more than
to use them for sexual pur-

“ poses, -as they were used
during the Holocaust -of .
enslavement. This calls for '

protection of our sisters by
the brothers.

We will find that once
we come to respect our-
selves, mind, body and
soul, we will rise to the
greatest degree. This will
be reflected in our grade
point averages, in how
long we survive on cam-

pus and in our overall

mental and spiritual well-
being.

This is a request forall
black people to try and
raise the nation.

There must be more
love amongst and within
us.

We must love one anoth-
er as a family. Pitt can be
either a training ground for
us to oppress our people
or the locale where we
gain the knowledge to
improve our community at
home.

If we are hateful towards
each other, we will not
care for our home commu-
nities after we leave carn-
pus.

If we are loving towards
each other, protective of
each other and mindful of
each other, it is guaranteed
that black neighborhoods
around the United States
will feel these effects, and
they will show it.

We must remember,
there is a nation of millions
of black people out there
that depends on us.

men of positions they deserve but
fail to acknowledge the uncon-
scious discrimination some employ-
ers practice in hiring people.
People who are concerned with the
environment are denounced as
extremists who are making a big
deal out of nothing. Recently, when
I was listening to the supreme
being’s radio show for amusement,
Rush masqueraded as a scientist
and tried to convince his listeners
that the depletion of the ozone
layer was not a major problem.

The latest example of a “Rushie”
column was the assertion by
Michael Gilbert that teachers at the
University of Pittsburgh are propa-
gating liberal, radical and socialist
ideas. I am not going to argue that
political beliefs do not infiltrate
professor’s lectures. It is virtually
impossible to teach a history or
political science course in a com-
pletely objective manner. This is
especially the case in a history
course where so many events are
open to different interpretations.
Even though professors’ discourses
may lean to, t;l1_e_.left, or right on the

to believe him or the
text.

Generally, exams in history
courses are of essay format and the
answers are supposed to be argu-
mentative in nature. In the courses
I have taken, teachers will not
grade an essay on whether the stu-
dent’s opinion matches their own.
Instead, correctly so, they will
grade the essay on how well the
student argued his/her point and
how strongly it was supported by
factual information. Therefore, I
cannot believe that a student’s

‘ grade depends on whether or not

he/she agrees with the teacher.

The columnist also argued that
reading assignments had a liberal
message and class discussion topics
often included gay rights, racism
and inequalities in the family struc-
ture and gender roles. What is so
wrong with this? I thought the pur-
pose of a college education was
not just to memorize facts but to
take what we learn and apply it to
the social concerns of today. A col-
lege classroom can be the ideal
place to explore issues like
inequality and gay rights, which are
becoming increasingly important in
the political arena. What evil can
come out of discussing racism in a
college classroom when racism
threatens to divide this campus? I
think a liberal perspective would
better serve students than reading
the works of fine upstanding citi-
zens like Morton Downey Jr. and
Howard Stern.

With their third straight loss
— a 68-62 home decision to
St. John's — the Panthers
have done nothing to defy
experts‘ predictions that
February is, again, tank time.

By Sean Duncan
Stajf Writer

Blame it on Febnrary. Blame it on the the
lack of enthusiasm. Blame it on poor shoot-
ing. But any way you dissect it. it’s the same
common denominator — a huge 68-62 Big
Fxast loss to a sub-par St. Johns University
Redmen team at the Fit’/.gerald Field House
last Saturday night.

The game boiled down to which team
was going to hit its free throws down the
stretch. In the waning minutes of the game,
Pitt (7-6 in conference, 15-8 overall) didn't
hit its free throws while St. _Iohn’s (5-7, 11-
10) did.

“At the end we stepped up and hit our
free throws,” St. _]ohn’s head coach Brian
Mahoney said, “and that’s the difference in
close games like this, you’ve got to make
your free throws.”

The loss was Pitt’s third in a row at home
and fourth in five games. '

“It’s a tough loss,” said Jerry McCullough,
who scored a game-high 20 points.
“Basically what’s happening is we’re going
down just like last year  Regardless of
what people say, we got that February
slump on our minds. And when we get
down, everybody thinks ‘Here we go
again.”

“It seems like we go through this every
season,” Jason Maile said about Pitt’s 1-3
February slump. “It all happens around the
same time. We have to get out of this. It
shouldn't happen like it happened last year.

“It’s all on our minds."

Clarion beats Pitt Wrestling 29-6

By Dan Lauso
and Tyson Nagy

For The Pitt News

In just about every sports season, a team goes
through good spurts and bad spurts. The bad
spurts can be attributed to different things:
injuries, a tough schedule or lack of focus.

Two of the three can be linked to the tough
times the Panther wrestlers are currently fighting
through.

The Panthers dropped their second straight
Eastern Wrestling League match as the Clarion
Eagles beat them 26-9 Sunday afternoon at North
Allegheny High School.

The match brought Pitt senior Rich Catalano
back to the place where his wrestling career took
off. A big crowd showed up to see Catalano
return to his alma mater.

“I feel kind of odd, we have a better crowd
here than at home,” Catalano said.

Despite the enthusiastic crowd, the Panthers,
missing two of their key wrestlers, fought hard
but couldn’t come up with enough decisions.

"I thought the guys wrestled really hard,” Pitt
head coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “They never
quit, and they never stopped."

The Panthers’ Chris Stevens delivered his sec-
ond strong showing in a row. He didn't win t_his
match, but he did control the action throughout.
Stevens, a rookie, is showing signs of maturity
and and promise that could make him a major
player on this team in the years to
follow.

Pitt’s John Richey, finally able to wrestle with-

.»..av.~\..«.»«.'m:."-‘

out a face mask, won his eighth straight match,
raising his season record to 18-4. Richey’s match
was nip-and-tuck the entire three periods with
nothing decided at the end of regulation. Richey
attacked to start the overtime period and scored a
quick takedown to win the match
5-1.

The Panthers dropped the next three matches
to really put themselves behind the eight ball.

Sean Hoover, Greg Budman and Eric Yanek all
displayed good efforts but couldn’t solve the
Clarion riddles that were thrown their way.

Catalano did himself proud in front of his moth-
er and father and the many supporters who were
there to see him yesterday by winning his match
7-2.

The void left by the injury to Jeff Kloiber could
not be filled as Derek Burgert and Sean Kennedy
lost in the 177 and 190 lbs. classes.

The day ended on a high note for the Panthers
as heavyweight Pat Wiltanger brought some life
to the crowd with a takedown at the 22-second
mark of the third period to secure his 20th victory
of the year.

"\X/e’ve lost two guys for the year, but we went
out there and fought,” Stottlemyer said.

The loss brings the Panther’s record to 9-6 over-
all and 5-2 in the EWL.

The first of the two consecutive losses came
Thursday night against Edinboro University at
Fitzgerald Field House.

At the point in the season when coaches want
their team to peak, it was the Fighting Scots who
seemed to be hitting their stride, as they defeated

McCr/tllougb upset at teammates’ lack of intensity in loss

Despite key play by
rookie Maile and
center Mobley, key
minutes not provided

by Shreef and big
forward position

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

The wave of emotion that the
Pitt Panthers have been known
to surf with success this year
was nothing but a mild ripple of
indifference in a game that had
the look of a must-win.

In fact, the show of enthusi-
asm ended, for the most part,
just after the Pitt Panthers broke
their pre-game huddle near
midcourt with a chorus of
hollers and laughter.

For 32 minutes, the Panthers
played with sagging spirits and
lost, 68-62, to St. John’s in the
suddenly unfriendly confines of
Fitzgerald Field House on
Saturday.

“I didn’t see the fire in some
of the people’s eyes that I usual-
ly see it in when we get down,”
Pitt guard Jerry McCullough
said. “I don’t know the reasons
for that. I’m gonna approach my

teammates later, one-on-one,
and ask them about it, but  it
hurt.”

Despite Jason Maile’s first half
three-point shooting and
McCullough and Eric Mobley’s
attempted heroics that started a
late second—half comeback, the
Panthers looked listless at home
as they faltered against a team
with a .500 record.

“We've got to play with inten-
sity from the moment the game
starts until it ends,” McCullough
said. “I felt there was some
effort there, but  we’re not a
good enough team to keep
turning it on and off.

“I don't see any reason for us
not to win. I was discouraged.”

Pitt’s troubles started from the
get-go when the team produced
only four points in the first 8:44
of the first half on 17 percent
shooting in that stretch.

The Panthers eventually
caught-the Redmen and went
into the half only down 30-27.

St. John’s’ James Scott got the
hot hand early in the second
half, contributing to a Redmen
lead that grew to as high as 15
points.

“The first five minutes of the
second half we have to establish

Jerry McCullough said his mates’ lack of intensity "hurt."

the way we want the game to
go,” said Mobley, who scored
15 points and pulled in 10
rebounds. “We haven't done
that at all lately.”

Pitt Coach Paul Evans com-
plained about the missing out-
put from-the players he is used
to counting on.

“We’ve got to get better play
out of our forwards and better
play out of [Ahmad] Shareef at
the two—guard,” Evans said.
“We’ve got to get better play out
of some of the kids. Three for-
wards have 12 points together.
That’s not making it.”

The desire in forwards Chris
Gant and. Willie Cauley to intim-
idate, the animation within
Orlando Antigua and the con-
centrated leadership of Shareef
were all lacking against St.
John’s. ,

Cauley usually supplies an
offensive lift off the bench, as
well as a physical presence.
However, with one point and
one rebound, Cauley barely got
himself on the stat sheet.

Gant, while posting
respectable numbers of eight
points and 10 rebounds, lacked
his customary gusto until mid-

Maloy’s final foul shot rims out as Lady Panthers lose, 75-72

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Early yesterday afternoon in
South Orange, N.J., the 10-point
Pitt lead late in the first half was
a memory. The fact that Seton
Hall dominated the boards in
the second half and Pitt hit its
three-pointers all game long did
not matter. Neither did both
teams’ weak shooting from the
field.

Pitt senior guard Erin Maloy
drew a foul from Seton Hall
point guard Jodi Brooks on a
three-point shot attempt with
one second left. The one-time
starter who now serves as the
Lady Panthers’ top reserve,
Maloy stepped to the line with a
chance to tie. She drained the
first two, but missed the third.

“This game did not come
down to Erin Maloy’s free
throws,” Pitt head coach Kirk
Bruce said. “All that would have
guaranteed us was overtime.

  
 

Any nurse who just wants a job can
find one. But if you’re a nurs-
ing student who wants to be in
command of your own career, consider
the Army Nurse Corps. You’ll be treated as
a competent professional, given your"own - ~

There was nobody I wold rather
have at the line than her. I will
still say that after the game.”

Sharnona Marable hit two free
throws of her own as Seton Hall
held on for a 75-72 victory and
sole possession of second place
in the Big East at 12-2, 19-3
overall. Pitt fell to third place
with a conference mark of 11-3,
17-5 overall.

Pitt has had trouble with
strong inside teams like Seton
Hall, but the Lady Panthers
actually out-rebounded the
Pirates 28-23 in the first half.

Things changed early in the
second half when Pitt’s senior
center Carolyn Miller picked up
her fourth foul only four min-
utes in and played sparingly the
rest of the half. Seton Hall domi-
nated the boards in the second
half by a 26-10 margin.

“It was a big difference
because they were big inside,”
Bruce said. “[Miller] is very good
at getting the crucial rebounds

in the big games.”

The Pirates had a definitive
edge in fouls and hit 27 of its 52
free-throw attempts (84.4 per-
cent) in the contest. Pitt’s guards
attacked the basket to draw
fouls, and the Lady Panthers
had a solid game at the line, hit-
ting 19 of 25, but attempted
nine fewer foul shots than Seton
Hall did.

Pitt was in control for much of
the first half due to its edge on
the boards and a stiﬂing defense
that held the Pirates to only 30-
percent shooting from the floor.

The Lady Panthers took a
double-digit lead of 18-8 only
9:42 into the contest on a three-
point shot from Jenine Joyce.

Pitt held a sizable lead most
of the half, stretching it back out
to 10 on a free throw by Carol
Morton with 2:17 remaining.
Then the Pirates took off on a
run of their own.

with 18 seconds left in the half.
Maloy, who finished with 12
points, extended the margin at
the break to 36-31 with a three-
pointer.

Pitt got its advantage back to
eight early in the second half on
a three-point shot from Jill
Colabrese, but the Pirates went
on another streak, this one of a
16-4 variety, to take a 47-45
lead.

The game remained close, but
the Pirates pulled out to a 70-64
advantage with only 1:06 left.
Pitt responded with a 6-1 run on
three-pointers by Maloy and
Joyce. Joyce’s shot with eight
seconds left brought Pitt within
71-70.

Brooks hit two free throws on
a one-and-one, setting up
Maloy’s opportunity to tie the
game.

Friday night at Alumni Hall in
New York, the St. John’s
Express (5-16) hung close to the

Pitt’s defense clamped down.

St. John’s did not score again
until forward Pam Odom’s
three-point play with 1:31
remaining. By then the Lady
Panthers had built a 15-point
lead.

The Express cut the deﬁcit to
10 points 12 seconds later after
Pitt’s Jill Colabrese fouled
Allegre Schell on a made three-
pointer and Shell hit the free
throw, but St. John’s could get
no closer as the Lady Panthers
held on for a 73-60 victory.

“There are no guarantees,”
Bruce said of the win against a
struggling St. John’s team. “We
had a tremendous second half.
We played a lot of good
defense.”

The front line carried the Pitt
offense again as forwards Jonna
Huemrich and Joyce and center
Miller combined for 48 points.
The Express’ starting front court
was not nearly as effective.
Odom scored 21, but center
Gina Moore and forward
Suzanne Collins were scoreless.

Huemrich has come on offen-
sively of late, this time scoring
22 points on 11-of—19 shooting
from the ﬁeld to go along with
nine rebounds. Joyce scored 16

THE PITT NEWS Monda

Feb 14 1994

Cup full or empty in

gymnastics

By Neal Riley

For The Pitt News

The results of Friday’s
women’s gymnastics meet
depend on how you look at the
glass —— is it half empty or half
full? The team did lose to
Eastern Michigan University, but
their team score was the highest
this season — 180.5 points.

In addition, Brenda Stevens
compiled the top all-around
individual score of the meet
with a total of 37.45.

The win went to Eastern
Michigan which compiled a
score of 185.65. Eastern
Michigan was a strong team,
averaging a higher score in
three events — vault, uneven
parallel bars and the balance
beam. Pitt came out on top in
the fourth event, the ﬂoor.

On Friday, Pitt first performed
on the vault. This was a strong
event for the team. Pitt’s score
was 45.5750. Eastern Michigan’s
score was 46.5.

Contributing high scores for
this event were Robyn Senior
with 9.3 and Brenda Stevens,
Bethany Toellner and Christine
Battista who all scored 9.1. Also
competing in this event for Pitt
were Michelle Cole with 8.975,
and Lori Buck with 8.75.

“The vaults that we do are
pretty good,” assistant coach
Ben Rovee said.

Head coach Debbie Yohman
said that the performances on
vault were good, but they could
be improved along with the
other events.

In thenext event, the balance
beam, Pitt was not as strong.
This event has proven to be a

consistent problem for the gym-

nasts as they have had trouble
staying on the beam during
their routines. Their score for
this event was 43.175 compared
to Eastern Michigan’s score of
46.675.

For Pitt on the beam, Stevens
gave a high score of 9.45. The
rest of the scores were, Buck
(8.85), Senior (8.5), Toellner
(8.425) and Cole (7.95).

“Despite our troubles on
beam, we didn’t lose {Friday
night] on beam,” ‘Yohman said.

According to Yohman, the
team performs well on beam in
practice but chokes when it
comes time to do the same dur-
ing competition. She said that
all five of Friday’s competitors
performed their routines with-
out a fall during practice the
night before.

Yohman said that the prob-
lem was not a lack of confi-
dence, but just a matter of trying
too hard.

“They’re concentrating on
lnot falling] rather than just
doing it the way it’s supposed to
be done,” Yohman said. “'That’s
our Achilles heel right now.”

The third event for Pitt on
Friday was the uneven parallel
bars. The scores for this
event were Stevens (9.45),
Senior (9.15), Buck (9.525),
Cole (8.55), Johns (8.575) and
Toellner (7.8).

Rovee is the coach for the
bars. He said that the team will

upgrade a few of their bar rou-
tines in the future. He said that
there were a few new tricks in
Johns’ routine on Friday.

“That [addition to the routine]
definitely helped us out,” Rovee
said.

The final event for Pitt was
the ﬂoor exercise. This was the
strongest performance for the
Panthers during Friday’s meet.
They scored 46.6 points, beat-
ing Eastern Michigan score of
46.575 points.

Scores in the floor exercise
were Stevens with a 9.45,
Toellner (9.4), Senior (9.36),
Cole (9.25), Buck (9.15) and
Johns (8.75).

“We had three super events,”
Yohman said, “but we’re always
capable of bettering ourselves.”

End o’ line

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

It was the beginning of the
end for the Pitt women’s swim-
ming and diving team at Trees
Pool on Saturday. The 140-79
win against Duquesne was its
last dual meet of the season and
its ﬁnal tuneup for the Big East
Championships.

Pitt honored the careers of

- Pitt seniors Laura Nerone,

Candie Burke and Jen Burns at
the meet. »

“My four years went by really
fast,” Burns said, “and now that
the end is here it’s a weird feel-
ing. I never really did think it
would come.”

But it has. And the three
seniors are going to be missed.

“The seniors have done a
tremendous job helping me in

the transition," first-year head
coach Marian Cassidy said.
“Their leadership is not just in
the pool but outside the pool as
well. I’m really going to miss
them.”

In the pool is where the
seniors led on Saturday. Burke
and Burns joined junior Christy
Knobloch and rookie Kelly
Bennett to win the meet’s first
event, the 200-yard medley
relay. Nerone teamed with
sophomores Alicia Tymes and
Vicki Geubtner and rookie Kara
Crombie to finish second in the
medley relay. The one-two
sweep of the first relay was just
a hint of what was to come.

The Panthers (7-4) took first
in eight of the 11 events follow-
ing the relay, and second in
seven of those.

“Marian told us to use it as a
quality day and to just have
fun.”

Junior Laura Zdyb followed
the first relay sweep with a first-
place finish in the 200-yard
freestyle. Burke and sophomore
Susan Poorbaugh finished sec-
ond and third respectively. In
the 50-yard freestyle, Crombie
finished first with Nerone com-
ing in second.

Sophomore Jenny Doran and
Burke swam one-two in the
100—yard butterfly, and Nerone
followed that with a first in the
100-yard freestyle. Rookie
Charla Caponi then won the
100—yard backstroke with
Geubtner finishing second.

After that, Burns won the 500-
yard freestyle, 14 seconds ahead
of the next finisher. Because of

its big lead, Pitt swam the 100-
yard breaststroke and the last
relay exhibition.

In diving, the women com-
peted in the one—meter event
twice, instead of the typical one
and three-meter events, because
the Duquesne divers aren’t
trained on the three meter.
Regardless, the Pitt divers had
little problem.

Sophomore Sunday
Lewandowski won both events,
with junior Kara Sixbury and
sophomore Amy Spinnenweber
finishing second and third both
times.

Now that the regular season is
over, the women have the next
two weeks to prepare for the
Big East Championships.

really get excited for the Big
East.” .

Rest is on the minds of all the
swimmers. They haven’t had a
full rest for any of their meets,
so they haven’t had the oppor-
tunity to swim as fast as they
can all season.

“The whole team is very anx-
ious to get to Big East and to
swim fast,” Caponi said.

The Panthers are going into
the Big East confident and opti-
mistic, despite being the under-
dogs. It’s confidence they’ve
gained from big wins this sea-
son over defending champion
Villanova and last year’s runner-
up, Miami.

“It’s realistic for us to have
high hopes for the Big East
without putting pressure on
ourselves,” Burns said, “because
we’re the underdogs.”

“The women’s meet is going
to be very interesting,” Cassidy
said.

“It’s a wide open meet from
us to Villanova to Miami to
Providence. It’s going to be a
dogﬁght”

And while the swimmers are
in the midst of their taper, the
divers have increased their
workload in preparation for the
Big East. They’re practicing
more now than at any other
point of the season.

“All the divers are ready for
the Big East,” Sixbury said.
“We’ll be peaking right at that
time.”

and dished out seven
assists.

As a team, Pitt took
good care of the ball with
19 assists and 15
turnovers. St. John’s did
not do so well, turning it
over 24 times, 16 of them
on Lady Panther steals.

One part of Pitt's succes
this season, the scoring of
senior Colabrese, has
been missing of late and
that continued against the
Express.

Colabrese scored only
five points and attempted
only two shots from the
field.

“We want her to get a
little more aggressive
offensively,” Bruce said.

Maloy continued to
pick up the slack off the
bench with 10 points.

St. John’s hit only one
three—pointer in the first
half, but the Express were
hitting just about every-
thing else. St. John’s hit
13-of-23 from the floor
(52 percent) and outre-
hounded Pitt 21-14.

way through the second half.
Gant stepped up his rebound-
ing — picking up half his total
in a six-minute stretch — before
fouling out with 3:48 remain-
ing.

Antigua (three points) nor-
mally spends as much time
encouraging his mates as he
does contributing toward the
outcome, but Saturday hardly a
peep was detected from Pitt’s
vocal leader.

“I think some players get
over-excited and I think some
players don’t get excited
enough,” McCullough said.
“Those that do get over-excited,
they have a bigger letdown
when we get into a hole, and
those that don’t get excited
enough, they’re even further
down.”

To their credit, the Panthers
collected themselves for a dash
at the Redmen’s lead with a 12-3
run. Pitt came within an Antigua

missed jumper from cutting it to
one with :54 to play.

St. John’s’ center Shawnelle
Scott, who scored 18 points,
said the reason the Redmen
overcame Pitt was a “mental
toughness thing.

“It could be easy for us to fold
our chips and give up, but
maybe we could turn it
around,” Scott said.

A quick check of the stats
shows few advantages to either
team. St. John’s shot 41 percent
and Pitt shot 58 percent. St.
John’s grabbed 37 rebounds
while Pitt had 38.

The difference in the game is
a hidden stat, and one that
enabled Pitt to defeat Boston
College and Georgetown earlier

“It hurts our character,”
McCullough said.

“\Ve’ve got this February
slump on the back of our
minds, so this loss really puts us
down.”

 

Wrestling

Continued from page 10
the Panthers 24-12.

“I was disappointed with
our effort tonight,” Pitt assis-
tant coach Scott Hovan said.

- “We should be hitting our
peak right about now.”

Edinboro brought an
impressive 12-2 record into
the match, but the Panthers
had won the last three meet-
ings between the two schools
and were looking to notch
their 10th victory of the year.

One Panther who did not
disappoint was New York
native Chris Stevens. He upset
Kevin Saniga, the nation’s
10th—ranked 118-pounder, 4-2
to open up the match.

“I’m so happy,” Stevens
said. “All week the guys have
been telling me how this
Pennsylvania boy was going
to whip my butt.”

John Richey was also very
impressive at 134 lbs. After

falling behind 2-0 with 40 sec-
onds left in the final period,
Richey took the lead with a
takedown and eventually
went on to win 6-2. Richey
has won his last eight bouts
while improving his record to
16-4.

Edinboro came back quick-
ly to take the lead for good by
winning the next three bouts.
Edinboro wrestlers have a
combined 60-16 record in
those three weight classes.

This set the stage for the
most intriguing matchup of
the night at 167 lbs. between
Edinboro’s Jim Straight (22-9)
and Pitt’s outstanding talent
Rich Catalano (21-1). Catalano
wasted no time on Straight,
jumping out to an 8-0 lead
after one period and eventual-
ly winning the bout 10-3.

Ex-Olympic gold medalist
and now current head coach
of Edinboro, Bruce

Baumgartner said he was par-
ticularly impressed with
Catalano. “He’s tough. He’s an
outstanding competitor. He
does a nice job for Pitt. They
have a great program here.”

Pitt dropped its next two
bouts at 177 and 190 lbs.
However, the Panthers were
without Jeff Kloiber, their 190-
pound star, who is out for the
season with torn knee liga-
ments.

Pat Wiltanger won a close
bout in the heavyweight class
to round out the Pitt scoring.

“We don’t have many shots
left,” Hovan said. “The NCAAs
are right around the corner.
This is the time to put it
together.” _

Mat Burns: Pitt wrestlers
will definitely have to put it
together this week as they go
on the road to face West
Virginia and Penn State, both
top-20 teams.

Brady then exploded to victo-

mers in the 400-yard individual
medley. Twenty-five seconds
later, Pitt's Mike Speerschneider
and Keith Bodnar finished sec-
ond and third, respectively.
Brady would be done for the
day. '

“That was the goal as far as
Chuck [Knolesl and I were con-
cerned,” said Brady. “I’m going
to be swimming the 400 i.m. at
the Big East, that’s my best
event, and we wanted me to
swim it one more time before
the Big East.”

The divers were in regular
form as they dominated both
the one—meter and the three-
meter boards. They swept the

boards clean by placing one
through four in both events.

Braud went out with a bang
by winning the three-meter
dive. John Soulakis, Jeremy
McClean and Wolfe finished
behind him, respectively.

Then, McClean won the one-
meter dive, with Braud,
Soulakis and Wolfe finishing
second, third and fourth.

“It was going to be the last 11
dives before the Big East,” said
Braud, “I wanted it to be a really
strong performance. I wanted
all 11 dives to be consistent, and
that’s what itvwas — I had a
great meet and that’s what I
want for the Big East.”

Bob Kupperman took the 50-
yard freestyle and Josh Heynes

butterfly with Heynes in sec-
ond. ,

Two ‘rookies, Brian
Kotkiewicz and Jeff Vaders,
dominated in the 100-yard
freestyle as they finished one
and two, respectively.

Sami Vartiainen won the 100-
yard backstroke and Gary Mule
finished third.

Right before Pitt exhibitioned
the rest of the meet, (meaning
that they didn’t get any more
points for their wins) -
Novotny won the 500-yard
freestyle. ‘

In the last event, Kupperman,
Chris Balke, Eric Stull and Perry
won the 200-yard freestyle
relay.

As the meet came to an end,
reality set in for the seniors.

“I was quite broken up,”

Braud said of’ his last home dual ,

meet. “I knew one day it would
happen but I never thought it
would happen today. It was
sentimental 

“It kind of felt like I was in
high school,” Daum added.
“You’re sad that this part is

behind you, but you’re excited ,

that you have the rest of your
life ahead of you. ’

“These guysare like brothers
to me, and that’s tough to leave

 behind.”

While a big part of the

_s__e_niors’ lives was ove-r, there

was still time to be happy.

“It felt pretty good in gener-
al,”- Economos said. “I was real-
ly excited to be done, —— it
seems like it has been a very
long career. It wasn’t as emo-

‘ tional as I tliouglit itwould be; .

“The team I will definitely
miss, but I won’t miss waking
up at 5 o’clock in the morning
and diving into cold water at
5:30 in the morning.”

The seniors and the rest of the
team still have one piece of
unfinished business to attend to

“I definitely think we will
win,” Economos said. “I think it
was a fluke last year that we
lost.

“I don’t think there’s any
doubt that we will get our 11th
title in 12 years.”

by Huemrich, and led
most of the way, but a
layup by Odom and a
Schell three-pointer gave
the Express 21 33-32 edge
at the half.

The second half was a
different story. St. ,]ohn’s
cooled off, hitting only 39
percent from the field,
and the Lady Panthers ,
started banging with the
Express on the boards to
the tune of a 20-18 Pitt

edge.
After four quick lead
changes, Huemrich’s

would never lose. The

eight more minutes, right
up to the 11-0 run that put

Continued from page 10

Free throws weren't the only
shots that weren’t falling for the
Panthers (61 percent). They also
had a tough time from the ﬁeld
— shooting a dismal 39 percent.
In fact, nearly 10 minutes into
the first half, Pitt was shooting
18 percent from the field, but
was only down 16-8.

“We didn’t shoot well,”
Panther head coach Paul Evans
said.

“We didn’t shoot well from
the foul line, and if you look at
the stats, we had some kids
who had some zeros across the

Then Maile (13 points)
stepped it up. Maile buried a
three-pointer, then Eric Mobley
(15 points) hit a baby hook.
Maile delivered two more three-
pointers and two baskets, as he
rattled off 13 points to tie the
game. But just as Pitt’s luck
would have it, Maurice Brown
answered Maile’s three—pointer
with one of his own with one
second left —— giving the
Redmen a 30-27 lead and the
momentum going into halftime.

“It’s really the first time this
season I really got off,” Maile
said of his hot hand. “It felt

more in the second half to get
the team closer."

“If Jason didn’t come through
in the first half for us, we would
have been out of it at that
point,” Evans said.

St. John’s usually relies on 6-
foot—11-inch Shawnelle Scott (18
points) to do their scoring due
to their lack of outside shooting,
but in the second half the shoot-
ers felt right at home.

Behind guard James Scott’s
11 points in seven minutes and
Sergio Luyk’s/two three—point-
ers, the Redmen stretched the
lead to 13 points.

McCullough tried to take the
game into his own hands.

Chris Gant picked off a pass
and dished it to McCullough for
a three-point play. Maile
grabbed another steal, and Ice
gave an alley-oop to Mobley for
a thundering dunk. After
McCullough sank four free
throws, he capped a 14-4
Panther run by dishing to Jaime
Peterson for a dunk, cutting the
lead to three points at 62-59.

But down the stretch, St.
John’s’ free-throw shooting was
too much. The Redmen hit six
in the final minute, erasing

had three players in double fig-
ures against a balanced Redmen
attack.

“We got to get more play out
of our bench besides Jaime
Peterson,” Mobley said. “Willie
[Cauley] (one point) has to
come in and help us out as soon
as he gets in the game.

“We got to get better play out
of some of the kids,” Evans said.
“Our forwards got out-rebound-
ed by our guards tonight. Our
three forwards had 12 points
together. That’s not making it.
