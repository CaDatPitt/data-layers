Stuclents dance through the night for charity

By Aaron Stier- Cohen
For The Pitt News

With only 45 minutes remaining
before returns to showers and
warm beds, ‘Pitt students’ dance
moves were reduced to head bob-
bing and two-steps. After 23 hours
of dancing, the once—energetic par-
ticipants of the 2012 Pitt Dance
Marathon were doing their best
to rally on the blue dance ﬂoor

strewn with beads, glow sticks -

and confetti.

Pitt Honors
College  

  celebrates

25th year

By Pat McAteer
For,The_,Pitt, 1\Iews

To his colleagues at Pitt, Glenn
Alec Stewart’s passion for his job
surfaced on a daily basis.

For the late Stewart, the found-
er and former dean of Pitt’s Honors
College, the creation of the college
25 years ago presented the oppor-
tunity to progress the University
that he loved from a regional cam-
pus to an internationally known
center of research.

On Saturday morning, 19 dis-
tinguished Pitt faculty and alumni
along with current Honors College
students honored Stewart’s contri-
butions to Pitt as well as the im-
pact of the Honors College on the
University for its 25th anniversary.
The celebration included a series of
lectures and musical performances
in the Belleﬁeld Hall Auditorium.

’ Throughout the day—long eel-
ebration, current Honors C01-

and alumni whose presentations
related to their speciﬁc ﬁelds of
study. Many of the students worked
directly with the faculty members
whom they introduced.

Edward Stricker, the dean of
Pitt’s Honors College, opened the
ceremonies by outlining the op-
portunities the Honors College
provides for students.

Stricker said the Brackenridge
Research Fellowships, which allow
students to conduct research with
a member of Pitt’s faculty and then
share their ﬁndings with students
conducting research in other dis-
ciplines, help students develop a
wide variety of skills.

“Here we’have students who
are drawn from disciplines all over
campus — not just Arts and Sci-
ences,” Stricker said. “[Stude‘nts]

Dressed in camouﬂage—print pants,
combat boots and sunglasses, eight
members of the Omicron chap-
ter of Alpha Phi Alpha walked on
stage Saturday to perform their
step routine.

Upon command, the brothers
stomped in an elaborate fashion
—— rotating, jumping and clap-
ping in synchronicity. The thud
of their boots and the strength of
their words resonated throughout
Soldiers 8: Sailors Memorial Hall.

The group yelled “one-nine-
one-nine—oh—six” in honor of the
fraternity’s founding date, 1906,
after stepping to some well—known
music, including Beyonce’s recent
hit, “Party.” /

This weekend, Pitt’s National
Pan-Hellenic Council hosted the
15th annual Steel City Step Show in
front of about 2,000 people.

Six teams performed with aims
to win the $1,000 ﬁrst—place and
$500 second-place cash prizes
awarded to the best sorority and
fraternity step teams.

Steppers dressed uniformly
as costumed performers ranging
from ninjas to magicians..They
used props including headlamps
and blindfolds, and they stepped
to song selections varying from
the Commodores’ “Brick House”
to Lil’ Kim’s “Magic Stick.”

After more than three hours of
stepping, members of the Delta
Sigma Theta sorority defended
their title and Phi Beta Sigma was
designated the best fraternity step
team, ending Alpha Phi Alpha’s
three-year winning streak. Alpha
Phi Alpha came in second place.

Didi Inyang, vice president of
the National Pan—Hellenic Council
and a member of Alpha Phi Alpha,
said that stepping involves a per-
son’s whole body.

“When you step, your body is
the instrument,” the senior said
about the traditional African
American dance that produces
rhythm through footsteps, claps
and the spoken word.

Prior to the competition, each

team practiced for weeks.

Junior Matthew Sauers, a mem-
ber of Alpha Phi Alpha, said that
his fraternity began practicing
seven days a week after winter
break.

Students rehearsing for the
competition had to prepare sev-
eral components before the show
in addition to its main stepping
aspect.

Huailei Wangl Senior Stall’l’l1otograph(:r
The step show it-atiii*<_-ti six per-lorrriiiig groups, each with its own clioicograpiicd routine.

Aaron Cook, member of Phi
Beta Sigma and a student at Rob-
ert Morris University, said that a
step show involves not only step-
ping, but vocals, clapping, acting,
dancing and the use of facial ex-
pressions. S

“Facial expressions are key,” he
said. “They determine the mood.
You can give a mean look, a serious

one or even a goofy one.”

Cook’s fraternity Phi Beta Sig-
ma embraced the role of warriors
during its performance of “The
Stepping Challenge,” performing
to a range of musical numbers in-
cluding Beyonce’s “Run the World”
and Carl Douglas’s “Kung Fu Fight-
ing.” ,

  discusses
hudgetcuts

By —Anc_l_re_w Shun A l l_ 

.  '~_  "'Assistant‘Néws Editor-~

During Pitt’s Board of’I‘rustees’ winter
meeting on Friday, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg made the case that Pitt
is simply a good investment for the
state. 0 ,

At the meeting in the William Pitt
Union, Nordenberg told the Board
that the University gave the state “the
highest return on their investment,”
pointing to the $800 million in re-
search grants awardedtothe University
and the 28,000 jobs that Pitt creates
in western Pennsylvania. He urged
the state government not tocut Pitt’s

On Feb. 8, Gov. Tom Corbett pro-
posed a 30 percentcut in state appro-
priations forthe nextﬁscalyearto three
of the four state—related universities
— Pitt, Temple and Penn State. Last
year, Corbett proposed a 50 percent
cut in state ﬁmdingto the state-related
universities, but the state passed the

‘ budget injune with onlya 19 percent

cut. ,
The Board went so far as to adopt

a a bipartisan resolution that it plans to

deliver to Corbett and leading mem-
bers ofboth houses of the General As-
semblyinprotestoftheproposed cuts.
The resolution expresses the Board’s
intent to work with “alumni, faculty,
staff, students and other friends of the
University” to ﬁght against the cuts.

“The members of the Board of
Trusteesdo hereby reafﬁnntheirbelief
that ﬁirther reductions to the Univer-
sity’s state support, as recently pro-
posed, should be eliminated and that
the Commonwealth should reaffirm
its intentionto continue workingwith
the Universityasanimportantpartner
in its status as a public, state-related
university,” the resolution said.

The Board passed the resolution
unanimously, but notgwithout dis-

to talk, and they learn how to listen.”

Stricker said that other Honors College _

programs, like the Bachelor of Philosophy

degree, provide “exceptional students”. .-
with a challenging and well—rounded cur-’

riculum.
He said that undergraduate students
pursuing the Bachelor of Philosophy degree

must write an “original paper of high qual— 

ity” and then defend it in front of a panel of
experts. Stricker added that the degree and
the Brackenridge Research Fellowships are
unique to Pitt. Students who are not in the

Honors College can also enroll in both of h

these programs. . ,

Christian Fagan, a senior Honors College
student majoring in economics and math’-
ematics, said Pitt’s Honors College allowed
him to immerse himself in his area of inter-
est: game theory. . . - »

“It’s given me opportunities that aren’t

available at all universities,” Fagan said in A

regard to his ﬁeld of research. “You can make
your education at Pitt as deep and as broad
as you want it to be.”

During the celebration, Fagan introduced. 4’

Pitt whose presentation related to Fagan’s
game theory research. C

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg laud-
ed the contributions of both Stricker‘ and
Stewart to Pitt’s Honors College and the
University as a whole. At the celebration,
Nordenberg used a story that took place
during the.“Snowmageddon” of February
2010 to demonstrate Stewart’s dedication

4 to his position. '

how he was doing, and he said he was doing
just ﬁne. And with a twinkle in his eye he said,
‘It’s a shame that a little bit of snow shut the
University down for three days. I’m glad to

Nordenberg said ﬁnding a replacement '

sent from others at the meeting. Pennsylvania’s
Secretary of Education, Ron Tomalis, a Corbett
appointee, was at the meeting as a nonvoting
member of the Board and voiced his opposition
to the resolution.

“This administration is committed to educa-
tion,” he said. “IfI were avotingmember, Iwould
not vote forthis resolution.”

Nordenberg said that if Corbett’s proposed
cuts go through, the University’s state 

beequaltowhatitwasin1987,whereasthestate _

budget has tripled in that timespan. The 

would alsobeatits lowest level, adjusted for inﬂa-
tion, since the University became a state-related
school in 1966.

Following the meeting, Nordenberg ﬁuther
discussed the possibility that the University might
reconsider its state-related status.

“We’re not traveling the path to becoming a
private universityvoluntarily. With each cut, were
becoming less public and more private,” he said.

The state budget wasn’t the only thing on the
Board’s agenda. It also unanimously voted to ex-
tend signatory authority for research grants and
contracts to four positions and voted to name a
Greensburg campus building after Frank. A. Cas-
sell, aformer president of that campus.

Representatives frombpththe Swanson School
of Engineering and the Alumni Association gave

presentations. Representativesfromthe engineer-
ing school focused on how they plan to use a $22
million grant they received on Feb. 9 from the
Richard King Mellon Foundation, and speakers
from the Alumni Association discussed how the
group could evolve as an organization.

The meeting also touched on the 225th anni-
versary oftheUniversity’s founding. Nordenberg’s
address enumerated some of the University’s
achievements over the years in engineering and
the arts as well as medical advancements from
Pitt researchers, such as the creation of the Salk
vaccine.

After listinga number of awards that Univer-
sity alumni and faculty have won over the years,
Nordenberg remarked, “This is a record that
would be a source of pride for any university.”

asked to raise $100 per dancer and $50 per

Greek Week president Keaton Macut said
he was proud of his classmates.

“It’s great to see these kids put their

“I’ve danced in the past, and it’s intrinsically

The marathon kicked off with an infor-

Sophomore Melissa Shapiro and junior
Cat Donahue, both on the green team, said
they enjoyed the new competitive aspect of

the night. '

“[PDM] is already better than last year,”
Shapiro said.

Teams competed in events throughout
the night, including a cornhole tournament,
musical chairs and a relay race. The winners
of the events earned points, and, at the last
event, organizers crowned the blue team the
color-war winners. The points won will go
toward the Greek Week competition.

Regarding the night’s activities, Donahue
added that she loved “tug of war, because

everyone fell over.”

Speaker reports
on autism studies
during lecture

Byjosh Won
Staff Writer

One out of every 110 children are born with an
autism spectrum disorder, making autism more
prevalent among children than AIDS, diabetes
and cancer combined.

Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for
Autism Speaks, the nation’s largest autism advo-
cacy organization, reported this fact in an hour-

long presentation to between2o and 30 students '

and faculty at Sennott Square on Friday.

Pitt’s chapter of psychology honor society
Psi Chi invited Dawson to report on recent de-
velopments in the study of autism, including
the beneﬁts for autistic-spectrum children of
interacting with other children when they are
between 6 and 12 months old — a crucial stage
of development.

“The idea is to be able to intervene at the
earliest stage of development,” Dawson said,
emphasizing the use of the Denver Model, a
developmental approach to autism treatment
that stresses early intervention.

Dawson said that her studies show that au-
tistic children’s IQs increased by as many as 30
points as a result of partaking in social engage-
ment from a young age according to the Denver
Model. This includes strategies such as waiting
for eye contact, offering interactive choices and

positively afﬁrming children’s responses with .

smiles and laughter. '

Psi Chi’s president, Kimberly Ha, said she
was happy with the presentation.

“She has a great reputation. She’s a rock
star in the ﬁeld [of autism],” the senior said
of Dawson, who has contributed to about 200
scientiﬁc articles and 9 books to the area of
study. Dawson’s lecture served as a informa-
tive complement to research conducted in th
ﬁeld at Pitt. V ‘ .

“Dawson’s lecturingwas so relevant to what
our lab-does,” senior Emily Schmidt said. “Be—
cause the sooner you start the treatment, the
more positive the outcome.” if

Schmidt, a psychology major, currently
works. at a lab at Pitt funded by the National
Institute of Mental Health. She studies children
to ﬁnd early indications of autism.

From observing behaviors such as pointing
and eye contact and ﬁlming all the interactions,
Schmidt helps determine factors that suggest
the development of autism in children who are
between 12 and 16 months old. These indications
could help in diagnosing autism in children of
very young ages, and, consequently, allow for
earlier responses in the treatment of autism.

Autism is usually diagnosed in children when ,

they are about 3 years old.

ing blindfolds.

Cook said that it is important to recog-
nize the distinction between stepping and
dancing, since traditional forms of dance
are “more forgiving” of mistakes. With step
routines, he said, one wrong motion can
distract the audience.

“The community is Very nitpicky,” he
said. “They will boo at someone who turns
their head the wrong way. It’s all about pre-
cision.” D

Competitors are judged on these levels

of precision as well as creativity, synchro-
nization, theme, content and audience par-
ticipation.

Pitt senior and Delta Sigma Theta mem-
ber Amy Mack said that a representative
from each fraternity and sorority judges
the event to ensure fair results.

“[The competition] is really based on

. who puts on a good show. It’s about the en-

thusiasm and excitement that is portrayed
to the judges,” Mack said.

Steppers elicited supportive cheers from
the crowd with their acrobatic positions —-
stepping bent over backwards and ﬂipping
in mid—air as they actively took stepping to
a different level.

Despite the competitive tension, a rep-

resentative from each fraternity and so-
rority contributed to a display of solidar-
ity between teams at the start of the show
by performing the unity step. During the
unity step, the groups performed together
on stage, with representatives introducing

, each team individually.

As students demonstrated their energy
with attention to their precision and tech-
nique, they stepped for more than high
scores.

Mack said that step dance has histori-
cally been practiced by African American
fraternities and sororities.‘

“Stepping is deeply rooted in history.
Through stepping, we show respect for our
founders,” Mack said. I

Debunking chemistry myths

cm are what you ea
and I shall become immortal!

 

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

As a chemist, I have a healthy
respect for the chemicals I work
with.

Some of these are toxic, others
are corrosive, many are ﬂammable,
and a few will burst into ﬂame if
they come into contact with air.
Handling them with informed cau-
tion is imperative. .

Unfortunately, whenever the
public hears “chemicals,” the word
“dangerous” is often rolled in, and

instead of informed caution we end I

up with ignorant terror. Take the
case of a Philadelphia affiliate of
Fox News, which recently aired a
breathless report about how ter-
rorists could snatch all kinds of
dangerouschemicals from univer-
sity laboratories. Why, the investi-
gators even found cabinets marked
“ﬂammable” and “acid”! They were

i A able to walk right up to tanks of

liquid nitrogen! They found, in a

ﬁime hood of all places, hydrochlo-

ric acid and diethyl ether!
Frankly, I would bestunned

if any lab lacked those particular I
_chemicals. q  _-
Of course,‘ all of this is causing‘ a

much mirth up at Chevron. For one

   
 

thing, terrorists wouldn’t have to
inﬁltrate a chemistry building to
ﬁnd the materials needed to build
a deadly weapon —— they could buy
something just as dangerous at
Lowe’s or make poisonous gases
using the contents of almost any
American’s cleaning cabinet. The
Oklahoma City bombing was car-
ried out using fertilizer, which is
why the Feds keep an eye on large
fertilizer purchases. And quite a
few chemicals can be bought on-
line. In any case, locking down
school’ labs would make conduct-
ing experiments even more dif-
ﬁcult.

This report — which prompted
Sen. Bob Casey to call for increased
lab security — is a prime example
of fear—mongering at its worst, but
it’s not the ﬁrst example of mind-
less fears about chemicals. What
struck me most was that reporters
probably didn’t pick what were ac-
tually the scariest chemicals in the
lab, settling instead on the vaguely
familiar and ominous-sounding
ones that would most alarm an au-
dience. The bit about nitrogen was,
I suspect, a way of freaking out a

‘ viewership whose onlyexperience

with liquid nitrogen came. from
watching “Terminator 2_:;]_udgn1ent
Day.” I’ 1,  -"'> 9*"

just one particular incident and
one particular chemical. For ex-
ample, “preservatives” has become
something of a dirty word. Many
products proudly displaythe fact
that they don’t contain any, and
many activist groups warn us of
their evils. But many preservatives
are quite harmless. By preventing
putrefaction, they reduce the risk
of food poisoning and make food
last longer, ensuring that people

. only have to go grocery shopping ‘

COLUMN

  

” . By Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
Columnist

The setting is a humid Guatema-
lan jungle. Sunlight accentuates

the verdant undergrowth, where ~

all manner of creatures slither and
crawl. An imposing, virile hero
stands rooted in the foreground. He
proclaims with a gruff voice earned
after years of war, “If it bleeds, we
can kill it.”

That was 1987, and the hero was
Major Alan “Dutch” Schaefer (Ar-
nold Schwarzenegger), a hardened
military man sent to the jungles to
rescue a missing minister, only to
have his team picked off one by one
by an otherworldly super being, the
“Predator.” But it can’t get Dutch
himself ——~ he uses both brain and
brawn to terminate the alien.

Fast—forward. A motley crew
ﬁnds itself trapped on an unknown
planet. Slowly, the group realizes it’s
not alone. Predators are hunting
them. Only this time, the hero is a
lanky, soft-spoken youngster. With
ﬁngers meant for piano keys resting
on the trigger of a machine gun, he
broods with a misplaced“ sense of
accomplishment. When asked to
lead, hesnarls, “Look, I’m sorry. You
want to play scout leader? Great.
You want to follow me‘? Fine. But
I’m not doing this  I’m better on
my own.”

That was 2010, and the hero was
Royce (Adrien Brody), a mercenary
ﬁghting for his life in “Predators,”
the latest unfortunate ﬁlm in the
franchise. These two movies — set
apart by 23 years and 23 inches of
biceps —— embody exactly what’s
wrong with Hollywood: the death
of the American action hero.

The 1980s and 1990s were gold-
en years for iron—pumping movie
stars. Schwarzenegger, Sylvester

Dolph Lundgren and Bruce Willis,
among others, were the premier

‘ representatives of the genre.

Where is this genre now?

Simply put, it’s morphed. Instead
of muscular stars we have laughable,
two-dimensional comic book he-
roes. Iron Man may be a sexy, suave
and smart billionaire who moon-
lights as a hero, but is his computer-
generated armor suit supposed to be
impressive? The little missiles that
shoot out of his dainty shoulders?

- The squeaking sound his suit makes
~ as it rears to shoot an explosion out

of his cutesy palm?

The only actor who might defy
this trend is Dwayne “The Rock”
Johnson. But even he isn’t a good
substitute. He’s too charming, and
after playing a tooth fairy in a ﬁlm
of the same name, he can’t be tak-
en seriously. It’s not about muscle
— it’s about muscle and attitude
combined. Arnold’s gap—toothed
grin when he was about to blow
his enemy to hell was his signature,
his larger-than-life contribution to
the screen. And although he starred
in ﬁlms that could be considered
childish, “Kindergarten Cop” was no
“Tooth Fairy.” Even in that movie,
we still get attitude: “Oh, excuse
me,” he says, “I forgot to introduce
myself. My name isjohn Kimble  ”
after which he cocks his shotgun. 2

Several developments might
have contributed to this transfor-
mation. Perhaps it was an overeager
adoption of animation technology.
Perhaps it was the transformation
of the ideal male physique from
large and bulky to lean and swift.
Or perhaps Hollywood became self-
conscious, and the largeness sud-
denly seemed too ostentatious.

One thing we can say for sure is
that Americans now expect their
movie stars to act more intelligently.
Yesterday’s heroes didn’t say much,
except for the occasional one-liners

The death of the American action hero

— “Let off some steam, Bennett” —
and they weren’t expected to: Their
physical appearances said enough.
Today, however, heroes are expected
to save the day by solving a puzzle
or using the best technology wisely,
as in the “Boui°ne” series and “Mis-
sion: Impossible” series. If heroes
can’t have both brain and brawn,
it seems natural that they’d choose
the former.

There’s also been several slumps
in box office sales since 2000, which
might have led ﬁlmmakers to believe
they weren’t doing enough to attract
moviegoers. CGI-intensive sequenc-
es and 3-D technology might have
been their substitutes for the real,
virile action ﬁgure. Now, if the hero
doesn’t look real enough, they paste
on some muscle (“Spider-Man,” any-
one?). The characters even stick out
of the movie screen to compensate
for their lack of presence.

This is exactly why “The Ex-
pendables” did so well: Most of the
original action heroes delivered to
America an experience it had all
but forgotten. “The Expendables
2,” coming to theaters this August,
will likely deliver the same.

No one can actually punch
through a car window. No one ﬂies
in the air if they’re punched hard
enough. And no one can jump out of
aﬂying aircraft and land unscathed.
But the ’80s heroes’ presence ex-
cused these inaccuracies — they
were able to deliver both the real
and the unreal.

This year holds in store many
rip-offs, remakes and rejects. If the
Mayans are true and 2012 is our last
year of life, don’t spend it sipping
fake cola. Drink the real thing --
watch the oldies, because they truly
are “As Good as It Gets.” I

bacco is all-natural. Wandering
around a forest eating random
mushrooms is foolish in the ex-
treme. Even nutmeg, if eaten in
suﬂicient quantity, produces heart
ﬁbrillations and other nasty ef-
fects that require hospitalization.
Meanwhile, many lifesaving drugs
are not natural —— nor, if we en-
joy polyester and nylon, are the
clothes we’re wearing at this very
moment.

And then there’s the biggest
bugbear of them all, the carcino-
gen studies. Now, I’m not saying
that carcinogens don’t exist or that
we shouldn’t be concerned about
them. I’m not saying that all ad-
ditives are absolutely safe in any
amount. But the thing to realize is
that, especially when it comes to
food, the standards of testing are
very strict. According to the Na-
tional Cancer Institute, for exam-

ple, the reports that triggered fears
about aspartame as a carcinogen in
2005 involved rats that were fed
aspartame in amounts equivalent
to a human drinking between 8 and
2,083 cans of diet soda every day.
Other results have proved incon-
clusive, and in science, before you
run around talking about how this
one result caused something bad
to happen, you had better damn
well be able to repeat it.

Let me re-emphasize that there
are hazardous chemicals out there
— even some of the things we use
every day can be dangerous. But
the notion that a chemical with
a long, unpronounceable name
is deadly should be discarded, as
it leads to unnecessary fear and
calls for action where either none
is needed? or appropriate action

is already being taken. It can also ’

lead to the establishment of “so—
lutions” that cause even larger
problems. I

Nauman sets example for Pitt

‘ By Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ Writer

When Tyler Nauman arrived at
Pitt, the wrestling team was most-
ly focused on winning individual
matches rather than trying to suc-
ceed as a team.

But ﬁve years later, the Panthers

have become a dominant squad in A

the Eastern Wrestling League -
winning three straight conference
championships — and individual
accolades have followed the team’s
awards.

“It is deﬁnitely better now than
when I got here,” Nauman said. “I
could have bought into the ways
the program was — that was not
really caring if everyone won or
not —— but that wasn’t me. I wanted
to win from start to ﬁnish.”

Nauman, a redshirt senior, and
the other upperclassmen helped
shift the direction of Pitt’s pro-
gram. The progress is evidenced by
a group of underclassmen that put
winning duals and the conference
before individual performances.

“The older guys have set the
standard that, although wrestling
may be somewhat of an individual
sport, everyone on the team still
has a job to do,” sophomore Shel-
ton Mack said. “That has been

R€LlSllll‘l senior Tyler Nauman is the only current Pitt wrestler who has reached All-American status.

shown by us wrestling well and
winning EWL titles.”

Nauman helped shift the team’s
focus, and he’s also worked to ex-
pand the abilities of his teammates.
A talented mat wrestler, Nauman
has helped underclassmen develop
that skill in practice.

“As I come to the end of my
career, one of the biggest things
I’ve left my teammates is a better
feel for wrestling on the mat,” he
said. “When I got here, we never
wrestled on the mat and always
practiced on our feet.”

Nauman’s impact will be dis-
played for years to come on the
EWL Championship banners hang-
ing from the rafters of the Fitzger-
ald Field House — the home arena
where Nauman and the senior class
suffered just one loss.

“Being a part of Pitt winning
three straight EWL titles was amaz-
ing,” Nauman said. “I neverwould
have thought that that was going to
happen when I got to Pitt. It means
the world to me, because I’ve never
been on a championship-caliber
team.”

At Middletown Area High ‘

School in Middletown, Pa., Nau-
man broke the school records for
wins (156) and pins (75). He placed
in the top 10 all four years at the
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Ath-

letic Association Championships
and was an All-State wrestler his
entire career.

Nauman was already accus-
tomed to winning when he ﬁrst
set foot in the wrestling room at
Pitt.

“I always want to win,” Nauman
said. “My lifelong goal has always
been to be a national champion —
after that, a multiple All—American.
Those goals have never changed.
As the years went by and I became
an All-American, it proved to me
that I could reach those goals.”

The redshirt senior placed ﬁfth
at 141 pounds during his redshirt
sophomore year at Pitt and earned
his ﬁrst All-American status. He
reached his goal of becoming a
multiple All-American with a top-
eight ﬁnish at the NCAA Champi—
onships.

He’s the only current Panther
to hold All—American status. Oth-
er Pitt wrestlers, including junior
Anthony Zanetta, want to become
All-Americans this season and will
turn to Nauman for leadership.

“Tyler’s aveteran,” Zanetta said.
“He has seen it all, and he knows
what it takes to win at nationals.
He is someone to look to for guid-
ance this time of the year.”

Panthers lose fifth straight

Woodall, Gibbs combine for eight total points

By Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer ‘

Travon Woodall’s questionable
decision—making down the stretch
stiﬂed any hope of a late comeback
for the Panthers as Pitt dropped
its ﬁfth—straight game on Sunday
to Louisville.

On Pitt’s second—to—last pos-
session, the point guard took a
contested jumper with 17 seconds
left in the game and the Panthers
trailing 53-52. Following the miss,
Louisville freshman Chane Behan-
an hit two free throws to boost his
team’s lead to three points; Wood-
all drove to the hoop for a quick
two points on the next possession
to cut Louisville’s lead to 55-54 with
4.1 seconds remaining.

The risky decision backﬁred as

Peyton Siva hit two foul shots for

the Cardinals shortly after and Pitt
senior Ashton Gibbs’ shot fromjust
past the half-court line hit the back
of the rim.

The ﬁnal buzzer sounded, sig-
naling a 57-54 win for Louisville
at the KFC Yum! Center in Ken-
tucky.

Woodall provided a spark for
the Panthers in late January when
the team went on a four-game win-
ning streak. Woodall -— coming off
abdominal and groin injuries — led
his team to big wins over George-
town and at West Virginia.

_ Gibbs also beneﬁtted from the
point guard’s ‘return to the lineup,
as Woodall began to draw defend-
ers off the sharp—shooting senior.
The Panthers became a trendy pick
to make a complete turnaround
and earn a tournament bid.

But when Woodall’s play took
a turn for the worse, so did the
team’s record.

Woodall scored just four points
Sunday, going 2-10 from the ﬁeld.
The redshirt junior had two as-
sists and turned the ball over six
times.

The Panthers struggled against
Louisville’s full—court press. Pitt
turned the ball over 18 times -— a
normal occurrence for this year’s
Panther squad — and the Cardi-
nals took advantage by scoring 24
points off the mistakes.

The latest loss dropped Pitt to a
dismal 4-12 record in the Big East
and moved its overall record to 15-
14. With two games remaining, the
Panthers must win one to avoid
their ﬁrst losing regular season
since the 2000-2001 season.

Over Pitt’s decade of success,
shutdown man-to-man defense has
been a staple. The Panthers played
good defense in the ﬁrst six min-
utes of Sunday’s contest, holding
the Cardinals to only three points.
But after the ﬁrst media timeout,
the Cardinals went on a 18-3 run
to take a 21-11 lead.

Then the Panthers’ offense and
early defensive execution began to
disappear. 4‘

Down 10 points, the Panthers
showed some ﬁght leading up to
halftime. ].J. Moore made a quick
layup and a jump shot, separated
by one free throw by Louisville’s
Russ Smith, to narrow the score
to 22-15.

Powered by a 13-4 run, Pitt
pulled within a point and trailed
the Cardinals 25-24 going to the
locker room. Moore scored seven
of the 13 points during the scoring
streak. ’

Pitt routed
in final

home game

Byjasper Wilson
Staﬁ" Writer

Perhaps it’s a good thing that the Pitt wom-
en’s basketball team doesn’t include any se-
niors. Saturday’s loss at the Petersen Events
Center would have been a disappointing way
to end a career. S

The lopsided 63-39 defeat to Seton Hall
(8-21, 1-14 Big East) —— a team that hadn’t
won a Big East game until Saturday — was
far from indicative of the type of perfor-
mance a team wants to have in its last home
game of the season.

-“It was just an unbelievable train wreck,”
Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato said.

With the loss, this year’s Pitt team will
become the ﬁrst under Berenato —"who
has been at the helm for nine seasons —
not to win at least two Big East games. The
Panthers, now on a 14—game losing streak,
will wrap up the regular season on the road
against West Virginia tomorrow.

The Panthers (8-20, 0-15 Big East) strug-
gled mightily with scoring, and redshirt

sophomore Ashlee Anderson was the only
Pitt player in double ﬁgures. She ﬁnished
with 11 points. _ l‘ T r _ T
“We didn’t haveanyone standout, which
was unusual,” Berenato said. . 9 .

Anderson made a 3-pointer at the 

buzzer to bring the Panthers’ ﬁnal tally to
39. The basket managed to keep the season
low for total points at 37 — a score Pitt has
reached twice, against Hampton and No. 4
Connecticut. —

Pitt managed not to turn the ball over
for the ﬁrst seven minutes of the game, but
after a Marquel Davis turnover at 12:53, the
team’s old habits reappeared. -

Eleven of the Panthers’ 19 turnovers came

3 When he arrived at Pitt, Nauman wanted
to be an education major. But Pitt’s program
includes a ﬁfth year that consists of student
teaching, which wouldn’t have been pos-

all the teaching prerequisites and plans to
pursue teaching in graduate school while
hopefully becoming a graduate assistant for
wrestling.

“I want to stay at Pitt,” Nauman said. “But
it currently won’t allow wrestling to have a

tial to score consistently for the Panthers.
Moore has shown ﬂashes of crucial talent in
his past two games, scoring a career—high 21
points against South Florida and dropping
a team—high 16 points against the Cardinals
while grabbing seven rebounds.

Fellow small forward Lamar Patterson
scored four points and grabbed three re-
bounds in only 14 minutes Sunday.‘ The
sophomore was in foul trouble for most of
the game. Since his 18-point performance
against No. 10 Georgetown, Patterson has
been a relative non—factor.

In the second half, Louisville started
slow again. Pitt scored the ﬁrst six points
and jumped out to a ﬁve—point lead on the
Cardinals. But Cardinal senior Kyle Kuric’s
3-pointer capped a quick six points that put
Louisville back in the lead, 31-30.

Smith followed with a run of his own for
the Cardinals. He was the only Louisville
player to score from just under the 14 minute
mark until 8:31 remained in the game.

During that ﬁve-and—a-half-minute
stretch, Smith scored 11 points. Three more
points by Kuric and an offensive rebound
and layup by Behanan earned Louisville’s
its biggest lead of the second half, an eight-
point margin of 49-41. ,_

Smith ﬁnished the game with 18 points to

lead the Cardinals. He added four steals as
the man pressuring Pitt’s guards in the full-
court press. The pesky Smith caused most
of the troubles that Woodall and Gibbs had
bringing the ball past midcourt.

Kuric’s day ended with 17 points as the
3-point specialist went 4-7 from beyond the
arc. The senior also added four rebounds,
two assists and two steals for a well-rounded
performance.

The Panthers surged back to within two,
but Kuric nailed another 3-pointer bringing
the score to 53-48 with one second remain-
ing on the shot clock and 3:25 left in the
game.

Pitt fought back.

With just more than a minute remaining,
Woodall hit a tough jumpshot with Kuric in
his face. A missed front end of a one—and—
one by Gorgui Dieng led to a smart pass by
Patterson to a wide-open Dante Taylor for
a dunk with 28 seconds remaining, making
the score 53—52 in favor of Louisville.

With the Panthers down one, Woodall’s
late-game decisions sealed the win for the
Cardinals, and Louisville completed the
season sweep over Pitt. Louisville is 15-3 at
home this season.

score ﬁve times during the ﬁrst half, but
that’s as close as they would get for the rest
of the game.

After shooting 9-23 from the ﬁeld in the

’ ﬁrst half, Pitt dropped off after the break.

Down by 11 points at the start of the
second half, Pitt went on a seven—minute
scoring drought that killed any possibility
of a comeback.

The Panthers scored their ﬁrst point of
the half on a Chyna Golden free throw, but
roughly three minutes went by before Ti-
Anna Porter converted a layup for the next
Pitt basket. ’

The scoreless stretches led Berenato to
bemoan her team’s offensive ineptitude in
the second half.

“You can’t continue to go possession

after possession defensively and not have
productivity offensively,” she said. “That’s
a collective effort. Everybody was dejected
and couldn’t pick up anyone.”

Seton Hall and its league—worst offense
made easy work of Pitt’s porous defense,
and the Pirates snapped a 16—game losing
streak with the victory.

Seton hall seniorjasmine Crew showed
why she’s one of the best offensive players
in the Big East as she picked up 19 points.
Junior-Terry Green ﬁnished, with 11.

rebounding the Panthers 45-30.

Pitt’s defensive rebounding in particular
left much to be desired. V

In a telling sequence during the ﬁrst half,
a Pirate player at the top of the key tracked
an errant shot from the wing, moved to cor~
ral the miss and glided down the lane com-
pletely untouched for the putback.

Pitt sophomore Kyra Dunn said the team’s
failure to compete during the last few games
boils down to its members’ lack of desire.

“It is a matter of us wanting it,” she said.
“It comes with us wanting it and wanting to
come in tomorrow and be a better team.”

The young Pitt team’s lack of conﬁdence
was a factor throughout the game.

Berenato declared that Saturday’s perfor—
mance was the only one she could recall this
season in which all of her players performed
without conﬁdence. '

As Seton Hall’s lead continued to grow
invthe second half, atone point reaching a

,;margin as high as 28, Qunn said the team’s

[spirits wavered.. W '7.

“In a game like this, it is easy to get down
on yourself when the score is not going
your way,” Dunn said. “Early on we were
not making shots, but once we started, our
momentum did pick up. It was hard to keep
momentum once they scored.”

The loss means that Pitt will play as the
No. 16 seed in the Big East tournament,
which begins on Friday.

“All we can do is focus on the next _day
and getting better,” Dunn said. “We need
to move on.” ﬂ -

Pitt wins two of three against Wuflord

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The Pitt baseball team won two out of three
games against Wofford this weekend to im-
prove its record to 3-4.

The Panthers lost three out of four games
to start the season, but after winning two
out of three in Spartanburg, S.C., Pitt will
hope for similar results as it travels east
to Conway, S.C., for the Coastal Carolina
Invitational this weekend.

An offensive performance like Pitt put
on in the ﬁrst game against Wofford could
go along way in helping the Panthers keep
their momentum.

Pitt 22, Wofford 12

The Panthers started the series strong
on Saturday, collecting 19 hits and hitting
three home runs in a 22-12 win.

Freshman Elvin Soto hit two long balls
while senior Rick Devereaux added one.
The Panthers scored 11 runs before Wof—
ford got on the board with three runs in
the third inning.‘

Pitt’s Casey Roche drove in ﬁve runs and
went 3-6 at the plate. Seven Pitt players ﬁn-
ished with at least two RBIs. Soto led the
Panthers with four RBIs, followed up by
Sam Parente (thre_e), Stephen Vranka (two),
Devereaux (two), Derik Wilson (two) and
Kevinjohnson (two). ,

Pitcher Matt Iannazzo picked up the win.
He pitched 5.2 innings, allowing six runs
and eight hits while striking out seven bat-
ters. With two more wins, Iannazzo will tie
Corey Baker for the program’s win record.
Iannazzo currently has 22 wins.

The Panthers scored seven runs in both

the second and fourth innings with 10 total
hits in the two frames.

Pitt 7, Wofford 8

Pitt dropped its second game against
Wofford as the Terriers scored the tying
and winning run in the bottom of the eighth

~ inning.

The Panthers started strong and led 5-3
entering the seventh inning, but they gave
up three runs in the bottom of the seventh
to surrender theadvantage to Wofford.

Pitt scored in the top of the eighth to
regain a 6-5 lead, but Wofford’s Konstantine
Diamaduros and Eric Brenk hit consecutive
RBI singles to give this Terriers the win.

The Panthers ﬁnished the game with 10
hits, including a home run and a single from
Devereaux. Anthony Defabio and Roche
singled twice, while Vranka, Wilson and
Johnson each singled once.

Pitt 8, Wofford 4

The Panthers scored six runs in the tops

of the sixth inning on Sunday to overcome
a 4-0 deﬁcit and win the last game of the
Wofford series.

After the Terriers broke the scoreless tie
in the bottom of the ﬁfth by putting four runs
on the board, Pitt responded-in the sixth,
putting up three hits and six runs with help
from two Wofford errors and three walks.

Pitt added two runs in the eighth inning,
asjohnson scored on a wild pitch and Defa-
bio scored on a Roche walk.

Roche went 2-3 at the plate with two ’

RBIs, while ﬁve other Panthers each drove
in a run. g ,

Matt Wotherspoon threw seven innings
for Pitt, allowing seven hits and four runsﬂ

Panthers finish undefeated in Wolfpack Challenge

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The Pitt softball team picked up four wins
over the weekend at the Wolfpack Challenge
in Raleigh, N .C., pushing its season record
to 5-2.

Strong offensive performances from
Holly Stevens and Kelly Hmiel and solid
pitching from freshman Savannah King led
the Panthers to two victories over Lehigh
as well as wins over North Carolina State
and Kent State.

Pitt 4, Lehigh 2

Junior catcher Stevens hit a two-run home
run in the eighth inning to give the Panthers
a 4-2 victory over Lehigh in their ﬁrst game
of the challenge on Friday.

The game was tied at 2-2 after the sev-
enth inning, and senior Kristen Cheesebrew
started at second base because of tie-breaker
rules. Stevens’ home run — her ﬁrst of the
year —— drove in Cheesebrew and put the
Panthers ahead by two runs.

In the bottom of the eighth, King struck
out two batters. First baseman Ciera Da-
mon ended the game, getting the out on-a
groundball to ﬁrst.

Pitt fell behind 2-0 early, but at the top of
the second inning, freshman Carissa Throck-
morton drove in classmate Maggie Sevilla.
Pinch runnerjessica Rhodunda then scored
on a sacriﬁce ﬂy to tie the score.

King ﬁnished with sixth strikeouts,
picking up the win to improve her record
to 2-1. ,

Pitt 6, Lehigh 5 A

The Panthers picked up another win over
Lehigh on Saturday, coming from behind
once again to win 6-5.

The Mountain Hawks scored ﬁve runs in
the ﬁrst inning, but Pitt closed the gap, with
three runs in the third inning.

1 Senior Niki Cognigni started the inning
with a base hit, and Damon followed with a
single that advanced her to second base. Cog-
nigni scored on an error. Hmiel then singled
to left ﬁeld, scoring Sevilla, and Throckmor-
ton brought in Stevens with a single.

Throckmorton tied the game in the ﬁfth
inning with a triple, and Cognigni scored the
game-winning run in the sixth. She reached
base with a single to left ﬁeld, stole second
and then scored after Lehigh walked both
Sevilla and Cheesebrew.

King ﬁnished with another strong perfor-
mance for the Panthers, pitching2.2 innings
and picking up the win.

Pitt 5, North Carolina State 2

Pitt senior Kelly Hmiel hit a three-run
home run and Chees ebrew drove in another
run in the ﬁrst inning as the Panthersjumped
out to a 4-0 lead against North Carolina
State.

The Panthers wouldn’t surrender the ad-
vantage they gained in the opening frame,
defeating the Wolfpack 5-2 .

Sevilla started the game strong with a
double, and Cheesebrew brought her home
with a double of her own. After Stevens
reached ﬁrst on a wild pitch, both Cheese-
brew and Stevens stole a base. Hmiel scored
them both with her third home run of the
season. ‘

Freshman Carly Thea scored Pitt’s ﬁfth
run in the second inning, hitting a single and
then scoring on an error. '

North Carolina picked up its two runs on
long balls in the second and third innings.
