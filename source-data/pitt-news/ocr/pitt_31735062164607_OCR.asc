DC. March

In expectation of a nation-
al call by Martin Luther
King and the National As-
sociation for the Advance-
ment of Colored People
(NAACP) for a march on
Washington this week-end
or any week-end in the near fu-
ture, a committee has been form-
ed to prepare for such a march.
Th committee is headed by Paul
DuBois, Karen Woolf and Ani
Freedman. .

Lists will be available in the
Towers lobby each Wednesday
until the call, from 11 a.m. to
1 p.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30

, p.m. On these lists students will

put their names and phone num-
bers and indicate that they have
$15 in CASH available, if they
are interested in participating
that week-end. If the call is is-
sued Thursday or Friday for a
march that Friday or Saturday,
members of the committee will
call the ‘listed students.

The marchers will assemble at
7 a.m. the morning of the march
and board chartered buses, pay-
ing $11 in cash as they board.

Qualiﬁed leaders will brief stu-
dents on proper procedure and
will ‘travel with each bus.

The buses will reach Washing-
ton about 1 p.m. The students
Will then_ demonstrate until early
evening and return to campus.

These arrangements will be
more orderly and effective than
previous arrangements

Wednesday.

“It was the most terrifying ex-
perience you could ever imagine,”
Stern said. '

. “And the mounted posse could-
n’t have swung- their clubs any
harder,” Anderson continued.

Their tale, however, was not
one of total disbelief, but rein-
forcement of all they had read
of the civil rights strife which
had seemed so distant and un-
real.

The 130 from Pittsburgh com-
prised the largest single contin-
gency at the Montgomery march
site. Most of the University,stu-
dents stayed at the Jackson Street
Baptist Church, but, of the over-
ﬂow, “11 people slept in one
Negro man’s house next to the
church. He stood guard with a
shotgun that night both over us
and the church,” Anderson said.

Commenting on the Tuesday
demonstration,‘ Stern said, “I was
there’ when Rona got hit. We
were trapped on "the porch of a
pretty good house in the “White”
section. The sheriif’s posse came
on horseback and corralled 30 of
us onto a porch. They hit almost
everyone who tried to climb over
the Wall which was the only way
off the porch.”

“Everyone was crushed togeth-
er,” Block continued. “There was
so much force on the wall that
three layers of bricks were knock-
ed off.”

The bias of the students giving
personal recounts of their exper-
iences is evidenced in their state-
ments. The newspaper coverage
in the southern papers reﬂected
a bias opposite of that of the in-
volved students. When reporting

Rankin Calls Trip

Good Experience  

By MARSHA REI-INS

Vice-chancellor of Student and General
affairs Dr. Alan C. Rankin called the trip to
Montgomery by University students “good
for all of us, here or in Alabama,” when he
spoke at the Pitt Platform panel discussion
of “The Crisis in the South” Wednesday
evening in the Student Union Ballroom.

“This is the kind of experience from which
we can learn,” he continued. “It reminds us that
man can be an emotional animal and that civiliza-
tion can be a thin veneer over violence.” Dr.
Rankin also pointed out that the mass rumors
which circulated throughout the campus showed
those in charge “the need for critical mindedness

Students Recount Alabama Crisis

Students Were Non-Violent;

Stern Clai Police Inhuman

ByBILLCAB.lN

Eric Stern and a group of nearly 100 , ‘
travel-weary area students returned here ‘
Wednesday night after two days of civil
rights demonstration in Montgomery, Ala-

'l‘he crusade began last Saturday when . v
Linda Watts was notiﬁed by Student N on- —
Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) that non-
violent demonstrations were planned. After hur-
ried organizing, 3 collegians led by Watts and
University students Eric Stern and John Ruskay

“Two of the three buses received: 40 minute
(ACLU) lawyers,” said Stern, recently elected Stu-
dent Government President. “At no point did we
disagree with police orders. And often, when we
asked them what to do, they simply said shut-up.”

Reason, however, did not prevail. “The Coun-
ty Sheriffs posse was totally inhuman” said Stern, V
poking at a dish of jello. “I trusted the horses. .
more than them.”

City police, state troopers, and highway patrol.
officers also joined in the supposed law enforce-
ment. “It was difficult to tell who was directing
who,” said Stern, “but it seemed a planned thing."

The Pittsburgh group joined some 1200 other

participants Tuesday afternoon for a ~demonstra- «. --
‘ tion two blocks from the Capitol. It was here they .

met the brunt of alleged police violence.

“We asked them (police) if some of us could
cross the street,’ recalled Stern, rubbing his bruis-
ed jaw. “They said some could, but when we did-,
they formed a circle around us, locking their

“Then the horses came in,” he said, gazing re-
morsefully in the distance. “Before we knew it
they were attacking us with billy clubs, and horses,
were shoving us.” \

The law-enforcement officials made their as-
sault a selective process. “They had taken pictures
of the marshalls (demonstration leaders) during
our public meetings, and were acquainted with
us. When they began swinging, they chose the
leaders. I was struck across the face with a billy
club and had my leg bruised while being shoved
partially into a sewer,” said Stern, again rubbing,

But the police were not sadists, and some at-
temped in vain to curb violence, “Several indi- ,,
vidual policemen asked others to be less brutal, _
but they too were clubbed,” Stern said. '

Chancellor Issues Statement

University to Keep Present Status

In response to a recent
statement in The Pittsburgh
Press by two Democratic
ltgislators that the Univers-
ity was willing to become a
State university at the un-
dergraduate level, Chancel-
lor Edward H. Litcheﬁeld has is-
sued the following statement:

“I was greatly surprised to
read yesterday a report out of
Harrisburg which left the clear
impression that the University of
Pittsburgh had, in some funda-
mental way, changed its attitude
toward maintaining its present
status as a private, state-aided
institution of higher learning.” ~

“I want to both assure all con-
cerned that there has been -no
such basic change in our think-

 . i”3..““d!._i‘t.. the. same ﬁim9»°nc¢

again clarify the University’s pos-
ition on this subject as the Board
of Trustees and the administra-
tion see it at the present -time.”

“It is, and has always been,
Pitt’s avowed aim to be an in-
stitution which is primarily de-
voted to the well-being of the re-
gion in which it resides. Every
new program instituted at the
University during the last dec-
ade has had that principle at the
base of it, and it was this will-
inzness to serve which I was try-
ing to convey when I spoke re-
cently _to the‘ legislators from
Western Pennsylvania.” .

“Ten years ago, the trustees,

' administration and faculty made

a- thorough review of both the
University's then-current admin-

:e‘3?‘?*iV¢;.. «ml a8¢?°19¥‘?-icpssiiivni

  

and how it might best carry out
its commitment of service to the
region.”

“Recently, we have decided
that another such institution-wide
study is in order for the decade
ahead. The University's relation-
Ships with the state will be a part
of this study, as will every other
aspect of institutional life. To
draw any conclusions now about
the outcome of that study would
certainly be premature.”

“I am conﬁdent, though, that
it will reaffirm our basic com-
mitment to serve the region in
the most effective way and by
means of the best relationship to
the state itself. However, to imply
that our present commitment al-
-ready had been altered inan

IEVEEND EDWARD BIEGABT, Margaret Dobbins, Ralph Proctor,
and Paul Geisel, seated left to right, discussed the University student
participation in Alabama. The group met in the Student Union Ball-
room, Wednesday night, shortly before the first buses returned from
Alabama.

when panic strikes."

He added that the decision by
students to go or not to go ‘ to
Alabama; to stay at the Univer-
sity for “the job they were here
for" or to work for something in
which they belived helped them

to learn about themselves as in-

dividuals.

“We hear so much about mod-
ern’ students being second class
citizens," Dr. Rankin stated. He
deﬁned second class status as a
lack of freedom, a lack of op-
portunities to participate in and
communicate with society and a
lack of identity, and expressed
the hope that the activities of the
students in Alabama had helped

to dispel their second class feel-

mi!

Dr. Rankin also reported that
although it was not the Universi-
ty’s “responsibility to use tuition
money to support the students,
the administration was prepared
to advance emergency loan funds
to the students to get them back.”

The panel discussion was inter-
ruped by the arrival from Ala-
bama of Student Government
president-elect Eric Stern and
Rabbi Richard Rubenstein, a Uni-
versity chaplain. Greeted by a
standing ovation, Stern cautioned
those present not “to let up pres-
sure” and to continue sending
letters and telegrams to Congress
and to President Johnson as it is
“impossible to tell from day to

day” what will happen in Ala-
bama.

Speaking with the panel, Dr.

Paul Geisel of the Sociology De-
partment hoped that the students’
experiences would make them
realize “the evil and ugliness of
the segregated system.” He point-
ed to the Hill District and segre-
gated fraternities as examples of
segregation at the University, and
asked that the audience see
through the eyes of those return-
ing from Alabama, “the reality
of the American tragedy of seg-
regation.”
' Margaret Dobbins, University
student who spent last summer
in Mississippi, added that the Ne-
gro is kept apart from the cradle
to the grave and that voting
rights and education are not the
only answers to the problem.

Miss Dobbins asked the fewer‘

than 75 students who attended
the discussion if they had been
previously involved in civil rights

movements. A majority of ‘the

students answered yes.

Reverend Edward Biegert, a
University Chaplain, advocated
continued dedication to and dis-
cipline in the civil rights move-
ment when “Selma is no longer
on the front page.”

Ralph Proctor, executive sec-
retary of the University chapter

-of the NAACP, commented that

if the students’ trip to Alabama
“can convince people to take a
stand, it was worth it.”

Bill Freed went because he was curious to see what other civil rights workers
were like-—how sincere they Were—and because “everything else was meaningless until
I could realize What it was really like.” Elias ~ Brobotij went because he wanted to stop
talking and DO- something about it. Joel Ro enberg went because “I just had to!”

Bob Cunningham had been discussing the civil rights with a few couples at his
home and had decided that he didn’t care enough to do anything about it. When he went

to work at the lobby ‘B’ desk of Holland Hall and was present when Jim
Negro student decided to go, he had to stop and think again.

Horrors
Recounted

it, a deputy tripped me when I
started to run and in attempting
to get up a Montgomery police-
man hit me twice. Some guys
helped me so I wasn't injured
anymore. I was poked in the back
to make me run faster.

“This was the first civil rights
demonstration for most of us. We
knew to anticipate trouble and
were told how to protect our-
selves. But you never know exact-
ly what it is until the first time
you experience it. You feel a
tremendous amount of fear when
you see a dozen horses charging
at you. You can't explain this to
anyone. You have to experience
it yourself.”

Miss Siegal’s horror was echoed
by George Nemet when he°des-
cribed a beating that he saw. “I
saw one girl beaten," he said.
“She was cornered by two horses.
She laid down as she was sup-
posed to to protect herself. They
just beat her back. They showed
no regard for her being a wom-
an.” Nemet also observed that
they couldn’t tell the police from
the vigilantes. “They all wore
red helmets and no special uni-
forms. I hope I never see one of
those helmets again.”

Barry Weiser mentioned that
he heard someone refer to the
police as dogs. He added that

“‘let’s not refer to the police as
dogs. I'm _not here to be nice to
them. At least dogs don't bite lit-
tle girls.
Weiser, “and I agree.

“rm sure there must be some

nice people down there some- .
Awhere,” Weiser later added. “The -

guys on horses must have been
demented. The Negroes down
there were tremendous, though.‘

The reasons are all different, yet the people are satisfied that
they have been effective. They feel they were effective in two main
areas. They reported the situation of civil rights as Northerners see
it; they felt they showed some whites are interested in the rights of
Negros. ,

Cunningham feels that “there's some very necessary work that
needs to be done.” One of the most important things is informing the
poeple at home of the situation.

Mark Kleiman was glad that he went for the same reason. “It
made the nation and the school aware of what is going on.” He
elaborated that we in the North “don’t get the frustrations the Ne-

: heard  said:

groes feel—it’s amazing!”

Drobotij was impressed by the fact that “we were all accepted
by the Negro community.” “When they said ‘white people’ they meant
it derogatorily, but they didn't consider us ‘white people.’ Kleiman
added, “There was a real compassion between the people who went

down there and the Negroes.”

Pat Beaton, a graduate student in‘ education, expressed similar
sentiments when he said, “It (the demonstration) demonstrated to a
closed society that others are interested in their problems.” He feels

that the impression will last, however, we must continue to help

them. “They can't do it without our help, without federal aid.”

That the demonstrators related their version of the situation in
Montgomery and that there existed a close bond between the demon-
strators and the Negroes were not the only observations made.

Many returnees confirmed the reports of police brutality in
Montgomery. Freed said “that it was different from what he expect-
ed. We were told it wan non-vio1ent—it Wasn’t.” .

. Cunningham observed that “those state troopers concentrated on
women and children.” “If you looked} strong and healthy they left

you alone."

Rabbi Rubenstein Praises Action
Of Students While in Alabama

/ Rabbi Richard Rubenstein,
a. University Chaplain, was
“unreserved in the praise of
the courage, dignity, and
level-headedness of Univers-
sity students. He pointed out that
acting as a unit, they took no
unnecessary risks and did not
violate the law.”
In recounting the events of
Tuesday, Rabbi Rubenstein stated
that the police had agreed to let

students’ remain on the sidewalk
two blocks from the state capitol
where “they constituted no dang-
er, just annoyance.” Mounted P0-
lice unexpectedly charged the
group and other police formed a
comer which “locked students in
so that they could be more easily
attacked. It was a miracle there
Were no more serious injuries,”
he said.

on injuries sustained in the dem-

onstrations, one southern paper
reported that “ﬁve horses were
hurt.” The reporters from these
papers, it was claimed, would
not take pictures of those who
were bleeding.

Williams intimated that the
southern hospitality displayed by
the mounted policemen was car-

ried through by the southern bus

drivers who drove the last leg
of the trip. “At one point they
told us to get oﬁ the bus and
push because it wouldn’t start.
The men on the bus did this, but
one stayed on to hold open the
doors. We pushed the bus two
feet and somehow they were
then able to start it.”

As the tired foursome began
to relax over their ﬁ1‘St good
meal since Sunday, their com-
"cents hit many aspects of the
trip.

“You stay for one hour in the
Negro ghetto and Van can’t be-
lieve that people stay there all
of their life.”

“The southern Negroes are the
greatest people you could ever

later you were as scared as you

came up to the group.

Father Carroll told the police
that the students were doing a
study of the south and were on
their way to Tallahassee, Florida.
One member of the group be-
lieved that this was the only ac-
tion which averted trouble.

Zeldow also commented on a
Monday night incident concern-
ing the blocking of an ambulance
by demonstrators. According to
Zeldow, the ambulance was em-
pty when it went by him. Stu-
dents were in the street he added
but were not deliberating block-
ing the ambulance which pushed
the group forward into a posse
with billy clubs.

Those in the ﬁrst bus attempt-
ed to join a 6:30 p.m. march to
the state capitol, Monday. They
were stopped by police but were
guaranteed safety as long as they
remained in one black.

White families cruised by to
stare at the demonstrators, Zel-
dow said, and when the demon-
strators dispersed a. white crowd
spit and hurled obscenities at
them. ,

Fred Pollack commented that
Montgomery was “not the United
States but Nazi Germany.” He re-
lated that one policeman dared
some of the demonstrators to
step oﬂ the curb so “I can get
some of you.”

Stan Bernstein asserted that
the word scared could hardly_.ap-
ply to the situation. “It was a
different world. You were always
tense. When we got to the church
and they told us. not to leave the
bus until the doors of the church
were wide open, you realized the
situation you were in.”

STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS are quick to move out of the way of

Student Body Alters
Sentiments About Trip

The general sentiment of the student body concerning
the trip to Alabama seems to have changed greatly from
Tuesday evening to Wednesday evening when the students
returned, judging from their reactions.

‘Several students, including a number of student leaders,

who gave statements Tues-
day night at the WPGH Ala-
bama Information Centre
had a slightly negative atti-
tude concerning the demon-

strations and the people involved. --

Edwin Ganek, Owl editor, stated
Tuesday that “more exists than
everyone seems to believe, in-
cluding the students and the ad-
ministration. In a telephone con-
versation from one of the stu-
dents, it was stated that fewer
Pitt students are involved than
everyone thinks. It seems that
many students are taking the at-
titude that this trip is a mid-
semester break, a ‘Winter Week-
end.’ -

“Also, it seems funny to me
that one of the two Pitt students
hurt out of the 128 is no less
than Eric Stern,«recently elected

_ Student Government president, .

and possibly_ the man who would
the island.

gain the most from this notari-
ety.»

Wednesday evening, Ganek was
with the students who returned
from Alabama. After speaking to

Editorial.

A Beginning        

Eric Stern missed his inauguration on Wednesday. His absence from the Student

  

-banquet, ironically, held a more symbolic impact than would have his presence.

He was not at the banquet held in his honor as president-elect. Instead, he was
serving as a leader of the Pittsburgh contingency in the civil rights march on Montgom-
ery, Alabama. This campus has seen few acts of greater significance.

The new Student Government president was elected on a platform calling for stu-
dent participation in social movement. His election was a mandate from the student
body for this type of positive action. ,

A letter written by a Duquesne University student and appearing in the Sunday
New York Times claimed that there is an “apathy” belt around Pittsburgh. “There is

never anything exciting happening around here,” he stated.

What happened Sunday night in the quad when the buses left for Alabama was
exciting. So was the student reaction to those returning to Pittsburgh, Wednesday night.‘
The letter to the Times might have been accurate at an earlier -date. It is no

longer.

We have seen the beginning of increased student participation in Pittsburgh. It
is true that what happened in Alabama did not involve the entire student body at this
University. Those who participated in the Montgomery demonstrations were but a small

U fraction of the student population. Those who remained behind to Plan and Organize

were Willing to become highly and personally involved. Both these groups are to be com-

‘mended for’ their action.

The actions of a few generated an interest in the minds of the many.  too is
commendable, yet it is only a start. . . _
We now have a beginning that must be expanded. Student involvement imphes .

awareness of all areas of life and this awareness is an integral part of learning.

The Price Of Freedom 

The Real Issue In Vietnam

.. , 4

, The current debate over
United States policy in
South Viet Nam goes much
deeper than whether we
should get tough, get out, or
go on the way we have been.
The real issue is not wether
we should or should not be
there, whether South Viet
Nam is or is not the key to
Southeast Asia, or even
"whether or not South Viet

 Nam is worth
ﬁghting for.
The much
more basic is-
sue is wheth-
er or not
Americans

~ ’ are still will-
 in g to r is k
-3’ their for-
n'll'POLI'I0 tunes, a n d
their sacred honor to defend
their way of life.

South Viet Nam alone is
not worth a major war —
neither is Cuba, Berlin, Kor-
ea, or any other place in the
world. We can get out of
Viet Nam and probably not
do ourselves any mortal
harm today, tomorrow, or
next year.

BUT SOMEDAY, some-
time, somewhere — whether
it be in South Viet Nam,
Cuba, Berlin, Korea, or any
other place in the world;
whether it be next year, ﬁve
years hence, or a decade
from now we will have to
face the enemy whomever he
may be—and risk our safety
to save our freedom.

This is not pessimism.
This is not warmongering.
This is reality.“Peace,” said
an old sage, “is the dream
of the wise, but war is the
history of man.” ,

If an enemy is determined
enough, and strong enough,
and willing enough to ﬁght,
someday there will have to
be a showdown. “As long as
there are sovereign nations
possessing great power,”

  
     

1_, said Albert Einstein, who

knew too well man's capa-

bility for self - destruction,

“war is inevitable.”

And with more and more‘,
A nations becoming sovereign.

with greater and greater po-
tentials for power, the chan-
ces of another Hitler or Mus-
solini or Stalin also become
greater and greater.

THIS IS the danger we
face, and a risk must be tak-
en to meet it.

A country with atomic
bombs bulging out of its
back -pockets but without
the will to use them for fear
of self-destruction is as
helpless as a country dis-
armed.

We can’t become a nation
too scared to die. Fear is a
luxury we cannot afford.
“. . . Fear the time when
Manself will not suffer and
die for a concept,” wrote
John Steinbeck in his Grapes
of Wrath, “for this one qual-
ity is man, distinctive in the
universe.”

We must continually tell
ourselves as Winston Chur-
chill told England in the
darkest hours of the war
that “we would rather see
ashes than that it should be
taimely and adjectly enslav-
e '7)

‘ This does not mean we de-
sire war. This does not mean
we like war. But it does
mean that we would risk
war and accept war rather
than perish as a free nation.

WE WOULD all rather
have peace and this is espe-
cially true for the soldier for
it is he who pays the price
of war. “The soldier above
all other people prays for
peace,” General Douglas

MacArthur told the West

The

One of 

Point cadets, “for he must
suffer and bear the deepest
wounds and scares of war.
But always in our ears ring
the ominous words of Plato,
that wisest of all philoso-
phers: ‘Only the dead have
seen the end of war’.”

Tens of thousands of
American boys have already
paid and have paid dearly
for what we enjoy today.

_ They are the ones who lie

face down in the rice pad-
dies of Viet Nam, who rot-
ted in the jungleg of the
Pacific, who felt the cold
steel of bayonets in their
ribs as they stormed enemy
trenches whose stare be-
came rigid as they slowly

froze to death in the heat-

less cabins of Valley Forge.
This is the price that must

_be paid by a people who

would rather die on their
feet than live on their knees;
who would rather be dead
than red.

Everyone but fools wants
peace, but peace without
freedom is slavery.

THIS IS the challege that
America must eventually
have to answer. And answer
it she must, as she has done
so often in the past. If she
does not, the ghosts of a
million brave soldiers whose
bones lie in unknown graves
on the countless battleﬁelds
of all the wars this nation
has fought in, would rise to
haunt America through all
eternity.

Flagwaving? Extremism?
Superpatriotism? -— Maybe.

The question is — Is free-

dom worth the price?

Allan Schlosser’s ‘apology for
the student bus trip to Montgom-
ery (Pitt News, Wednesday, March
17) contains disturbing implica-
tions which transcend the pre-
sent civil rights crisis. These im-
plications concern the idea that
American college students are
able to make themselves “. . . a
political force that carmot be dis-
missed lightly,” that they “con-
stitute a reservoir of political

power.”

If I have not erred in interpret-
ing the article, Mr. Schlosser
feels that it might be well if this
reservoir were tapped more of-
ten, in the manner of the Mont-
gomery protests, in order that
college students, as a group,
might exert a large inﬂuence on
the process of social (and pol-
itical) change in this country. I
ﬁrmly believe this is a wrong
and dangerous attitude. .

There are countries where stu-
dent action does exert a direct
inﬂuence on national policies, as,
for example, in some underdevel-
oped, poverty-stricken, revolution
plagued countries of Latin Amer-
ica and Asia. But one must re-
member that anyone in these
areas who is rich enough and
well-fed enough to be a college
student is a member of a small
minority at the top of society,
Well above the mass of the popu-
lation in opportunity, income, and
inﬂuence, and of necessity a
leader of that society.

This fact, coupled with the pre-

1789 attitudes of many of the.

governments in such- countries,
naturally give rise to radical, or-
ganized student action in the

form of demonstrations, clashes.

With Police, riots, and revolution.
Thankfully, in the United States,
there is no power structure which
e110WS only a small fraction of
the Population to be educated,
leaving the greater majority in
a half-starved, illiterate state.

Thankfully, our governmental
system is ﬂexible enough in prac-
tically all areas to allow for ra-
tionali legal, democratic change,
so that mass protests and dem-
onstrations are generally neces.
sary.

However, there exists today in
our country an iniquitous social

//’,-C’

 

structure, which, as proved by
the 100 years since the Civil War,

has been hard to change through
normal legal means. The result
of the persistence of this struc-
ture in the face of legal and
moral attacks on it is the pre-
sent civil rights crisis, which of
late has involved student dem-
onstration.

To be of the opinion that these
demonstrations have helped the
cause, and to commend them, in
spite of the guitars, is one thing;
but to observe the political force
that students can wield, and to
imply that using this force more
often would be desirable, is quite
another. I believe the latter View
is tantamount to hoping that all
our problems turn into crises.

I do not say that college stu-
dents should remain blissfully
unaware of the nation’s problems,
nor do I advocate their non-in-
volvement. I simply believe that
involvement should be on an in-
dividual basis, with interested
students joining Democratic or
Republican organizations, or any
other interest or pressure group
they might want.

But as far as students constitut-
ing a political force per se, I fer-
vently hope it never happens. If
everyone with a problem to solve

“issued a called” for college stu- —

dent demonstrations, our nation
would be well on the way to mass
frenzy and mob rule. We don't
need any such expedients in the
United States to solve the vast
majority of our problems.

O’Connor Discusses
Poetry at Midday

While St. Patrick made his snowy arrival for En-
gineers’ Week festivities, a fellow Irishman, Ulick O’Con-
nor, recited poetry to some 175 Midday listeners Wednesday
afternoon. O’Connor, a poet in his own right, discussed the
Irish Renaissance and quoted from his seemingly boundless
memory of the works of Gogarty, Yeats, and Dylan Thomas.

“The Irish Renaissance burst into ﬂame in 1916 with

the men who led the insurrection against England. Ireland
won her independence by 1922,” O’Connor said. “The Irishman was
born at the turn century. He was born of the old Gael and.‘ new
Anglo-Irish.” The old Gael was the native Irishman and the Anglo-
Irish were those whose ancestors came in the 16th century.

Writer like Yeats, Synge, and
O’Casey were enveloped in the
national reservoir of exuberance
accompanying the birth of the
new Irishman.” These men took
old folk themes and modernized
them in their works. In Yeats’

died, an angel appeared to her
lover to tell him that she went
to heaven. God saved her be-
cause her motive was one of love,
indicating that the “Powers of
Darkness see only the dead, while

C Swimmer Andy James

Wins Despite Faults

By G%RGE LIES

Andy James came here, but never saw the school; he
owns a guitar but can’t play; and he wins events, but swims
wrong. Despite these seeming character _inconsistencies,
James has been an ‘asset to the swimming team this year.

“His only bad habit,” said Coach Ben Grady,” is that
he keeps his head up on the dives and turns and gets a
wave of water flush in the face.” In the last meet of the

season at Michigan State, James“
lost a chance to place high when
a wave choked him on a turn.

’ I “Once I'm on the starting block,
I think only of winning and since
a sprinter needs explosive power,
I try to get on top of the water
for speed as soon as I dive in,"
James said. “Because I arch my

water than most swimmers.”

   Frank Carver Sees: Hop

*3

 

By FRANK SMIZIK
Three big questions were
asked at Fitzgerald Field
House this term. Where are

the cheerleaders ? Where are
the fans? Where are the
good basketball players ? The
cheerleaders don’t come to
games because there is no one
there to lead, and the fans don’t
come because there aren’t enough
good basketball players.

But where are all the good
WPIAL ball players and why
aren't they here? Athletic Direc-
tor Frank Carver has answers,
but only hopes for solutions. “Of
the top basketball players in this
area only a few are qualiﬁed to
go to Pitt, this still includes a lot
of talent, however.” .

“The problem is convincing the
boys to come to Pitt. If they are
qualiﬁed to come here then that
means they can also go to Duke,
Michigan, and schools which em-
phasize basketball have better
facilities and a better campus
than we have here,” said Car-
ver. “Which would you choose?”

Although there is no easy sol-
ution to this problem, many peo-
ple including Coach. Bob Tim-
mons feel there should be an
assistant basketball coach for re-
cruiting. Carver agrees with the
idea, but says it's too expensive
for the athletic budget.

“To tell you the truth we put
less emphasis on basketball than

we do on football because there
is so much more interest in foot-
ball in this area,” said Carver.
“I’m not saying that there isn’t
any interest in basketball be-

cause the turnouts for the high.

school championship games dis-
prove that.”

“Coaches from all over the
country come to this area for
football talent,” Carver contin-
ued. “There are some good bas-
ketball players but not in the
great numbers that there are
football players. If we don’t have
a good football team more peo-
ple care than if We have a poor
basketball team.”

Although Carver admitted that
basketball is not as important as
football, he denied the Univer-
sity is a one sport school. “I try
not to think of major and minor
sports here, and I think that the
sports oifered in the winter
should be just as well attended
as football is in the fall.

“We give more scholarships in
football but that’s only natural.
I think if Ray Pilarski were still
on the basketball team it would
have been a winning team. We
haven't had great luck the last
couple years, but Pete (freshmen

coach Carl Peterson) and Bob .
(Timmons) have been working >

hard and it looks like we might
pull some good boys in this year.”

However, if Pitt is a one sport

showings. It wasn't a great team
to watch, but they were inter-
esting.”
Although some home games
were interesting, only nine of the
— 22 games were at home. “This
year’s monstrosity of a schedule
was my fault,” said Carver. “I
paid back some games that I
owed to schools and they were
played on the road. Also, I never
should have entered the team in
the Quaker City Tournament.”
“I should" have at least watch-
ed who was in the tournament
and who we were going to draw
in the ﬁrst round. We drew-Wich-
ita and that was a mismatch.”
Carver doesn’t intend to have
many mismatches in the future.
He intends ‘to ﬁt the schedule
more appropriately to the teams’
talents. “We aren't going to
schedule the real tough basket-
ball schools, but will ‘continue
some of our old opponents. Ford-
ham and St. Johns will probably

   

ere    

be on the schedule because we
have good relations with Ford-
ham and like to have the boys
make one trip to New York.

Despite all the talk, many 8005
basketball players continue to
avoid coming here, and they will
continue to do so until facilities
and student interest improve.
Carver, however, feels things
will change soon.

“We should have a better chance
recruiting now because Of the
new physical education facility.

who also play baseball will be
able to come here and play in

In the course of their studies of the nature
of sound, Bell System scientists have been
able to make signiﬁcant contributions to all
three forms of entertainment.

You might say that it was because the dis-

first explorers to come down the_ trail.

to its potential, the nature of sound'had to

study of sound ever undertaken by anyone.

To capture sound for study, Bell Telephone
Laboratories developed the ﬁrst electronic re-
corder for phonograph discs. For the first
time, performers recorded into microphones.

Then, in 1925, Bell Labs perfected an elec-
tronic system that synchronized sound and
action on movie film. The talkies were born.

To get better sound reproduction, they
started experimenting in 1933 with ways to
separate high and low frequencies to prevent
distortion. The result was a single-groove,
