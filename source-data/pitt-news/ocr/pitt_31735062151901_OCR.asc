Freshman
Unit Plans
Open Today

Assembly Finishes Mentor
Program, Starts Active
Group Participation

Beginning today freshman women
will stop worrying about how they’re
going to make the next mentor meet-
ing on time and start thinking about
the plays, debates, athletic feats or
newspaper that their respective units
will be enlivening the campus with
by and by.

For today at 12:30 o’clock the an-

nual unit assembly is scheduled for
Heinz House at which freshmen use
one hand to wave good-by to their se-
nior mentors and the other to shake
hands with their unit advisers.
' With the ﬁnal mentor meeting of
the semester last Friday, the Class
of 1940 completed the seven-week pe-
riod during which their senior friends
in need were helping them to learn
all the answers about their new Alma
Mater. .

On Wednesday the Beaux Arts
Salon will round out the series of
welcomes upperclass organizations
have been giving the freshmen, and
this afternoon the freshman women’s
own organizations will get under way,
when they will be seated according to
the units they have been assigned to.

Unit assignments have been based
on the ﬁrst and second choices pre-
viously indicated by the freshmen,
with membership in each unit group
being limite-d to 30.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, will preside at the assembly,
and Mary Jane Beachler, C37, chair-
man of the WSGA Organizations
Committee in charge of the freshman
activities groups, will introduce the
nine unit leaders. .

eAfter the close of the formal meet-
ing each unit will gather round to say
“How do you do” to the upperclass
woman who will guide its activities,
select nominating committees for its
election of officers and arrange a reg-
ular meeting time and place.

Unit advisers are: Acting unit,
Sally Digby, C38; dramatic discus-
sion, Helen Snyder, C37; French,
Ruth Recht, ED37 ; glee club, Blodwen
Angus, C38; literary, Jean Barnes,
C38; publications, Charlotte Atwell,
C37; public speaking, Evelyn Lowy,
C38; sports, Lulu Sekey, Ed37 ; stage-
craft, Helenclaire Goldsberry, Ed38.

SFA Committee
To Crack Down

On Infractions

Chaperones Must Register
Three Days In Advance
For- Social Affairs

“The SFA social commi-ttee has
gone off the elastic standard.”

This decision was reached at the
committee’s last meeting Thursday,
November 9. According to D. C.
Schultz, BA38, chairman, there have
been too many small infractions of
the rules to permit any more stretch-
ing of the regulations.

Although the committee has me-t
with social chairmen of all campus
organizations, many groups have
overstepped the bounds, Schultz says,
particularly in two directions:

Chaperones for all social functions
must be registered three days in ad-
vance at Heinz House, and must be
personally contacted. If the regis-
tration is late, the social committee
has two alternatives. It can either
prevent the holding of the affair, or
it can appoint chaperones at a cost
of $5.00 per chaperone to the or-
ganization.

To petition for special privileges
in case the affair is to be held in a
place not approved by the University,
or in case the time of the dance is
unusual, petitions must be presented
to the social committee at least three
weeks prior to the intended date.

These rules, according to Schultz,
are the least understood of any in
the committee’s code. “However,” he
says, “the rest of them are important,
too.”

Copies of the social rules may be
obtained from Miss Harrison in the
onice of the dean of men.

Coal Mine Trip Planned

Members of Collembolae, honorary
science fraternity, will take a trip
through an experimental coal mine
tomorrow. The mine is about a mile
beyond Bruceton. This is the fourth
ﬁeld trip of the year.

Chest Drive
Will Collect
$3500 Quota

Annual Student Solicitation
For Community Chest
Starts Wednesday

Solicitation of students will begin
on Wednesday in the drive to meet
the $3,500 quota set for the student
contribution to the Community Chest,
according to Dr. Vincent Lanfear,
chairman of the undergraduate com-
mittee.

The $3,500 will be counted in with
the total quota of $11,000 set for the
University as a whole, but the money
will be used mainly for campus ac-
tivities. The Community Fund will
receive 25 per cent of the student
collection. Thirty per cent will be
devoted to the student loan funds of
both WSGA and Men’s Council. The
YMCA will receive 20 per cent; the
YWCA 20 per cent, and Pitt-in-China
5 per cent.

Pitt-in-China funds are used to
support a teacher at Lingnan Uni-
versity in Canton, China, in return
for which that school offers the Uni-
versity an exchange scholarship. John
Paul Baker, BA38, is at present in
China on such a scholarship.

The classes to be canvassed will
be the ‘second hour on Wednesday,
and the third hour on Thursday. One
student solicitor for each ten en-
rolled students in the class will be
chosen. A ﬁnal canvass will be made
on Friday to contact those who have
not been reached on the previous two
days.

The classroom speakers will meet
at a luncheon today at noon for in-
structions in the Oakland YMCA club
rooms, Forbes and Bouquet Streets.

Since about 300 people are no-t
scheduled for the hours chosen, a
special committee of student leaders,
under the direction of Miss Helen
Battrick, executive secretary of the
YWCA, and Sarah Marie Wood, C37,
will contact these students.

To enable the different canvassers
to distingui.s-h between those who have
contributed, entirely, or by pledges,
and those who have not yet been ap-
proached, every person who has done
his part will be given a feather to
wear in his hat during the three days
of the canvass.

 

News Continues
‘Student Speaks’

Campus Passes Judgment
On Pertinent Questions

Starting today, The Pitt News will
again poll undergraduate sentiment
on important public questions.

Six questions will be asked those
interviewed this week. The questions
are diverse, dealing with such mat-
ters as the stand America should take
in the event of a war in Europe,
teachers loyalty oaths, and interna-
tional conferences for armament re-
duction.

Included in the list of questions
is that of whether special taxes should
be levied on chain stores, whether the
NRA should be revived, and whether
married women should be allowed to
work if their husbands are also
working.

Sophomores Expect Largest Hop Gatherin

For Annual Formal In U rhan Roof Tonight

 

Austin Wylie’s Orchestra To Provide Music. For Dance
As Formal Clothes, Grand March, Favors Add
To Festivities Of ‘Lucky Thirteenth’

 

By The Soph Hopper

With nationally-famous Austin Wylie’s Orchestra as the
drawing card of the Sophomore Hop scheduled for this evening,
members of the Hop committee are predicting that the affair
will live up to all of its promises.

Barring ﬂoods, earthquakes, epidemics and the like, Chair-

man Bernard Cashdollar, BA37, is
certain that the popularity of Austin
Wylie and his orchestra will have pa-
trons clamoring at the door for ad-
mission.
Formals In Order

Formal gowns and tuxedos will fea-
ture the hop, first University dance
to be held in the William Penn since
1934. Leading the traditional de-
vice known as the grand march with
Cashdollar will be Betty Brooke, C38,
a Kappa Alpha Theta transfer from
Allegheny College.

Albert Kairys, business manager
for the Hop, refuses to divulge the
name of his partner. He declares
he is saving her as a surprise.

McNair May Appear

Ex-Mayor William N. McNair was
extended an invitation to attend the
Hop, but up to today the ex—mayor
has given no deﬁnite indication that
he will accept.

According to advance press no-
tices, Austin Wylie’s 15-piece unit

for’parents of the men and women
of the class of ’40.

Rehearsals for the reception to be
held Friday evening, November 20,
at Memorial Hall, will follow a din-
ner at Heinz House next Tuesday.
Following the dinner, Mrs. Robert
Ayars, choral leader, will direct the
rehearsal for the selections to be
sung at the reception.

Handel’s “Nightingale Song,” Stra-
vin-ski’s “Dance of the Ballerina,”
“Hymn to the Virgin,” by Taylor,
and a waltz from Tschaikowsky’s
“Sleeping Beauty” will be included
on the program.

Ticket Sales High

Advance ticket sales have shown
conclusively that University students
have no fear of Friday the 13th, says
Cashdollar.

Faculty chaperones for this eve-
ning’s Hop include Theodore A. Sie-
dle, Mr. and Mrs. R. D. Ayars, Mr.
and Mrs. W. C. Arthur, and Mr. and

The stadium is aﬁre!

Henry Leighton, head of the de-

the smoke issuing from the ground
at the top of University Hill comes
from an abandoned coal mine that
honeycombs the side.

The last marketable coal was ex-
cavated during the World War, but
certain sections have been smoulder-
ing for years. The hill was part of
the old Schenley farm. A consid-

It has been

ierable sum of money was spent to

From time to time, ﬁre hoses have
been directed down the openings and
water turned on for days in efforts

to extinguish the blaze. But to no
avail.
Occasionally, smouldering cinders

are uncovered by workmen. Accord-
ing to Mr. Leighton, ﬁres of this sort
continue for years, but are not dan-

with two members of the Men’s De-
bating Association.

This morning the teams meet at
Ben Avon high school; this afternoon
they appear at Shaler Township high

at the Western Penitentiary. The
series will be concluded tomorrow
morning before a meeting of high
school debaters and their coaches in

o’clock.

Early last Saturday Robert McKee,
C37, and William Stark, C38, re-
turned from a two-day trip through
Ohio with a record of four victories,
two defeats, and one tie. After los-
ing the ﬁrst debate at Wadsworth on
Friday morning, McKee and Stark
went on to win all the intervening
debates until the last one at Youngs-
town on Friday evening.

Before an assembly of 1,000 stu-
dents of Shaw high school in Cleve-
land, the University team defeated
its opponents, and went on to take
the decision on Friday afternoon at
Painesville high school. The Reserve
lebaters were successful in garner-
ing a shift-of—opinion vote of the
audience at Youngstown Chaney high
school on Friday evening.

SFA Meets
To Discuss

New Ideas

Budget Committee, Student
Polling, Sex Education
Draw Consideration

New business for the ﬁrst
time this year held the spot-
light as the Student-Faculty
Assembly met for its November
session Tuesday.

Ideas discussed for the ﬁrst
time included a program for
sex education, the revival of
the Student Poll committee, and the
setting up of a ﬁnancial advisory
board.

After William Stark, C38, had in-
troduced the subject of sex educa-
tion, discussion made it apparent that
investigation of the idea was neces-
sary. Hubert Teitlebaum, C37, then
moved that it be referred to the
executive committee for considera-
tion.

Said Stark in defense of his idea:
“Sex education is one of the most
important elements in a full educa-
tion, and at the same time one of
the most neglected. Wherever it has
been tried it has been found most
successful.”

Suggests Financial Board

Stark then suggested the setting up
of a board, perhaps by Men’s Coun-
cil, which should have the power to
investigate the ﬁnancial needs of
n1en’s activities and recommend the
needed appropriations to the Univer-
sity. This, Stark suggested, would
be modeled after WSGA’s board
which examines budgets of all wom-
en’s activities. The situation at pres-
ent has the graduate manager of ac-
tivities considering and recommend-
ing all appropriations.

Frank Engel, E38, in opposing this
move brought up the fact that ac

Dancing To Success

THE ASSURANCE of a successful social season probably
hinges on the outcome of tonight's affair, the first formal dance
of the 1936-37 season.

Thus far, every dance with the exception of one went over
with—in true Barnum & Bailey fashion—a “bang,” at_ least ﬁnan-
cially. That one exception was a new event on the social calendar,
Cap and Gown’s revived informal in the form of a masquerade.

A University’s social calendar is only as heavy as the students
desire it to be. If tonight’s formal fails ﬁnancially, even though it
may be a great social success, then perhaps it is time to take some

Letter To
Editors __

Editors: The Pitt. News.
Dear Sirs:

Last year an article appeared in
“The News” with reference to the
supposedly aloof attitude of the
School of Pharmacy of the University
to the campus activities. While this
reply is somewhat late it is still ap-
plicabl-e.

In mid-October for the ﬁrst time
this year, “The News” appeared in
the School of Pharmacy. There is the

ﬁrst reason for the so-called aloof-
ness of the school. It never knew
when or what activities were taking
place on the campus.

facts. We then had members on the
Spring Festival and the Senior Ball.
The writer had the pleasure of serv- ‘

the number of students from

Pharmacy School was greatly in-

This was due without a doubt to the
representation on the committees.
Steps were taken last year by SFA
to ascertain the reasons for this
breach between the school and the
campus by sending a committee down
to the school, bu-t the most progress,
to my knowledge, that they made, was
an interview with the Dean. The stu-
dent body to this day is ignorant of
the fact that any such steps were
taken to bring about better relations.
This letter may help to explain
why the School of Pharmacy does
not appear more often in the many
activities of the University. If steps
are taken to remedy at least some of
the points mentioned, I am sure there
would be more o-f a feeling that the
School of Pharmacy was a part of the
University and not the feeling that
exists today—that of a separate

works out swell in my case. Camels help
my digestion. After a mealiand Camels,
I settle back and really enjoy life.”

The ﬂow of digestive ﬂuids, so vital
to proper nutrition, is speeded up.
Alkalinity is increased. You get
more good from what you eat.
For an invigorating “lift”- rm“
matchless taste — and "for diges-
tion’s sake”-the answer is the same:
Camels. Camels set you right! And
they don’t get on your nerves.

Camels increase digestive activity-

AFTER THE GREATEST FINISH UNDER FIRE IN
GOLFING HISTORY: Tony Manero gets set for cat-

when Tony Manero scored a spectacular 282 -4
strokes under the record—to win the 1936National

Tony's digestion stands the strain. Tony himself
says: "'For digestion’s sake—smoke Camels!’ hits

At Opening Concert

Cardwell Singers To Begin
New Book Chat, Music.
Series, Wednesday

,s1=A SPONSORS IDEA

 

A Negro Spirituals To Provide

First Program Theme

 

Final plan-s recently released
by the SFA-sponsored Concerts

: and Book Cha-ts C-ommittee in-
‘ dicate that a choral group from

the Cardwell Schoo-1 of Music,

5headed by Mary Cardwell

Daws-on, will open the series on
Wednesday with a program of
Negro spirituals. The concert
will be held in Room 144, Ca-
thedral, at 3:45 o’clock.

The Cardwell Singers, formed ten
years ago, have appeared in most of
the major cities in the United States.
They have sung frequently on na-
tional hook-ups over both of the big
broadcasting chains.’ "In this city
they sang for the Tuesday Musical
Club, and took ﬁrst place in the an-
nual Forbes Field singfest staged by
the Sun-Telegraph.

Their leader, Mrs. Dawson, was a
student at the New England Con-
servatory of Music, studying under
Earnest Hutchison, concert pianist,
and Arthur Foote, composer of many
famous American songs. Mrs. Daw-
son was soloist with the World’s Fair
Symphony during 1933-34. She is
now president of the National Asso-
ciation of Negro Singers.

The group plans to present time-
tested spirituals, but their leader also
asserts that, “we’ll sing a few of
Foster’s works because they go over
so well with audiences.” Their in-
terpretations of the Pittsburgh com-
poser’s works are “musically and
artistically satisfying,” according to
RalphLewando, Press music critic.

William Stark, C38, chairman of
the committee, intends to follow up
the concert of the Cardwell Singers
with other programs of prominent
Pittsburgh artists. Also, from time
to time, critics and writers will be
brought here to talk informally about
recent trends in literature. Stark
plans to present these affairs every
two weeks. They will be open to
students and faculty members and
will be free.

Assisting Stark are Mrs. Robert
D. Ayars, director of the Women’s
Choral; Helenclaire Goldsberry, C37;
Robert Raley, C38, and Kenneth
Houp, C37.

Pitt Player’s Show

To B e Sponsored
L By Panhel Council

The second showing of the Pitt
Players’ latest production, “The First
Mrs. Fraser,” will be sponsored No-
vember 24 by Panhellenic, local fra-
ternity alumnae group, according to
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men. The play will be presented
November 23 and 24 in Frick Audi-
torium.

This will be the ﬁrst time that any
Players’ show has been sponsored by
an off-campus organization and it is
the initial effort of the Panhellenic
in this ﬁeld.

Says Virginia Griﬂith, president of
Panhellenic: “Our entire organiza-

 

"tion is rightbehind your group and

we feel that Pittsburgh people will
soon become conscious of the ﬁne
plays the Pitt Players are producing.”
With the opening night of the show
little more than a week off, members
of Panhellenic and campus Women’s
fraternities have launched an exten-
sive ticket drive to make “The First
Mrs. Fraser” a ﬁnancial success.
According to Jack Levin, business
manager of the Players, season tickets
will not be honored on Panhellenic
night but will be good for student
night, November 23, the ﬁrst showing.

Dark Horse Selected
Chairman Of Dance

 

A new ‘ﬁgure appeared on the
campus activities horizon as David
Mackey, BA40, was chosen chair-
man of the 1936 Freshman dance.

Mackey is a graduate of Wil-
kinsburg High School and a pledge
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon social
fraternity. Claire Weil, C, the
ﬁrst freshman woman to pass the
appointments committee, was one
of the ﬁve who presented their
plans. The others were Jack
Hoeveler, C; Paul Neal, C; Samuel
Smukler, C, an-d Jack Lawler, BA.

The freshman dance is scheduled
for Friday evening, December 4.

Dr. Miller
D i s c u s s e s
Nationalism

Respect fer Alien Cultures
Necessary, Sociologist
States At Inquiry

 

By John Martinco

Nationalism can ﬁnd a way out of
its present dilemma by recognition of
the equality of culture groups and
respect for other cultures, Dr. Her-
bert A. Miller, professor of sociology
at Bryn Mawr College, told students
at Inquiry Forum Monday.

Dr. Miller ridiculed the belief that
there is a biological line around which
the people of one nation can rally.
“Blood is no valid reason for classi-
fying a nation,” he said. He further
explained that a country cannot suc-
cessfully rally around a religion, his-
tory or language.

“These assumptions rest on so many
different principles,” he declared,
“that when members of a national
group claim that because of these
things they are a chosen people, their
claim is not valid. The thing that is
valid is culture.”

“Most of the threat of war in the
last few years,” he continued, “comes
from the threat that a nation's cul-
ture will be overthrown by an ad-
joining culture. It is with this argu-
ment that leaders have rallied their
people to ﬁght for culture,” he said.

As an example of one way out of
nationalism, he cited the case of Rus-
sia. “They have succeeded in solving
the problem so well,” he stated, “that
if the Russian revolution had resulted
in nothing else, it would still be jus-
tiﬁed.”

Dr. Miller reviewed conditions in
the Soviet before, and after, 1917.
The heterogeneity of dialects and re-
ligion and persecution of the Jews,
according to Dr. Miller, have given
away to individual and cultural group
equality as well as racial and sexual
equalities.

“The result has been,” Dr. Miller
reported, “that all natural cultural
hostility has disappeared, especially
among the Jews.”

“The way out,” he aﬂirmed, “is to
let any nation have any culture it
wants, but to admit that it is just
as good as any other culture.” He
praised the Nationality Rooms pro-
gram at the University as a step in
that direction.

“This can be done within the capi-
talistic system," he stated. “We have
made some progress, but we still have
such alien-hating organizations as the
D. A. R. trying to develop within
the United States that spirit. Be-
tween countries that is the curse of
Europe. There is no hope of peace
in the world until such groups dis-
appear.”

SFA Meets

(Continued from Page 1)
tivities would be hampered by that
much more red tape in securing
budget appropriations, and that they
needed no more advising anyway.

Upon the admittance of the assem-
bly that some agency was needed to
obtain an accurate survey of student
opinion, Seder moved and Al Barr,

C38, seconded the revival of last
year’s Student Poll committee. Very
little of last year’s opposition was
noted after an amendment gave the
executive committee the sole power
to select questions for each poll.

 

Poll Committee Approved

Discussion of possible parking and
traﬂic facilities near campus was to
very little avail, since the suggestions
made would have made necessary a
large appropriation. Such things
were mentioned as the grading and
draining of Ruskin Field, and the
widening of the “horseshoe curve” on
Alumni Drive.

Reporting for the Diploma commit-
tee, Seder recommended that the
large size diploma be retained, for
this year, at least. He reported on
a poll he had taken of seniors, in
which approximately 77 per cent
were absolutely indifferent, and, as
Seder said: “They seemed more in-
terested merely in getting a diploma
than in what size it is.” After the
discussion the matter was referred
back to Seder’s committee, with di-
rections to explain the matter more
fully to the seniors, and to get a
larger and more representative cross-
section of their opinion.

Recommends Present Diploma

Stark reported the activity of his
committee for concert hours and book
chats, announcing the first concert on
November 18. Questioned upon the
payment to be made to his per-
formers, Stark retorted: “I don’t like
to bring such materialistic consider-
ations into the discussion of such a
spiritualistic subject as good music.
In fact, I hate materialism.”

Immediately before adjournment,
Stark remarked: “I am sorry I said
so much tonight, but the fact is that
we meet only once a month and I
get a brainstorm almost every day.”

Talk of a Committee for the Sup-
pression of Stark had no immediate
result.

Hampden Presents Excerpts
From ‘Hamlet’ At Assembly

 

Discusses Movies, Drama
In Interview Before
Start Of Program

By Milton Lehman

“He even looks like Hamlet,” some-
one said after the Assembly yester-
day, at which Walter Hampden, dean
of the American stage, read scenes
from his favorite Shakespearian mas-
terpiece, “Hamlet.”

In his dressing room before the
performance, Mr. Hampden discussed
the future of the American legitimate
play. “You ask me what inﬂuence
the modern movie has ' upon the
drama?” he echoed. “Why not ask me
what inﬂuence the 5 & 10 cent stores
have upon the department store. It’s
merely a matter of cost. Of course,
the movies are doing a splendid job,”
the actor added.

After pointing out the primary dif-
ference between the stage and screen,
Mr. Hampden declared that “the
movies can never take the place of
the human being—the actor in the
ﬂesh. People still want to see the ex-
ponent of the play in person, so to
speak, even though they sit, in the
second balcony.”

Of the play, “Hamlet,” his favorite
Shakespearian production, Mr. Hamp-
den said that the wit and the pathos
still are vital to theatre-goers today.
People will laugh at the subtle innu-
endos, will shiver with Hamlet when
he meets his father's ghost, even
though they have read and seen the
play many times.

Mr. Hampden was introduced to
the student body by Dr. S-tan-ton C.
Crawford, dean of the College. Be-
fore the readings the actor gave a
short introduction to the play. The
one-man interpretation of divergent
characters included the scene in

which Hamlet
father.

The instantaneous changes of char-
acter required by the lines were exe-
cuted by Mr. Hampden to perfection.
Horatio, Hamlet’s mother, the ﬂat-
tering Polonius, the treacherous Clau-
dius, and the obvious Rosencranz and
Guildenstern: all these were inter-
preted with a masterly movement of
head or hand, or a changed inﬂection
of the voice.

Perhaps the thing that m-ost stood
out was Hamlet's, or rather Hamp-
den’s speech to the players. It con-
stitutes the actor’s credo: not too
much shouting upon the eardrums,
nor too much “mouthing of words.”
Mr. Hampden follows his own advice.
