Local clinic
introduces

anti—suicide
counseling

_ By Sue Felder I

Sta ff Writer

Western Psychiatric Institute K

and Clinic announced the open-
ing of a teen suicide center at a
news conference yesterday.

I The center is called STAR, Serv-
ices for Teenagers at Risk, and is
expected by the state and the
university to set an example for
other communities throughout
the country. The Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania appropriated
$250,000 for the‘STAR project.

The center is composed of two
major components including
clinical service, dealing with chil-
dren with suicidal thoughts, plans
or attempts and outreach for
these type of children.

Suicide is now the second lead-
ing cause of death among youth
aged 15-24 with accidents the
Yirst cause and homicide third, ac-
cording to national statistics from
the U.S. Department of Health
and-Human Services Report.

In 1960, the suicide rate for 1 5
to 19 year olds , in Allegheny

County was 3.1.‘ That rate in-\
creased to 11.7 in 1985, accord- »

ing to research gathered by Dr.
David A.’ Brent, co-director of

STAR and Joshua Perper, Alleghel.

ny County Coroner.

The availability of firearms and
increased alcohol use may be
two factors associated with this

.increase in teenage suicides,

Brent and Perper found.

Two aims of STAR are to take
care of the kids and advance
methods of treatment and preven-

tion, according to Dr. Joaquim '

Puig—Antich, chief of child and

. adolescent psychiatry at Western

Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.
The three major sources where

‘youngsters express themselves

are with peers, at school and at
home, Puig-Antich said.

Dr. Mary Margaret Kerr, co-
director of STAR, is working on
a mental health curriculum pack-
age which can be distributed in
Western Pennsylvania school dis-
tricts to keep teenagers informed,
teach them social and school sur-
vival skills and how to deal with

some common psychological‘

problems. _ .
The STAR program will not
only involve students and psy-
chiatrists but also teachers, par-

Alumnus bestows $10 million

By Jill Carell

Assistant News Editor

$10 million, the largest single
personal gift in Pitt's 200-year his-
tory, has been donated to the

‘Graduate School of Business.

Joseph M. .Katz, founder and

' senior chairman of Papercraft

Corporation in Pittsburgh, donat-_
ed the money to the university to
develop and enhance programs
in the business school. The gift,
presented jointly by Katz and his
wife Agnes, was announced
Wednesday to the executive
committee of Pitt's board of

_ tI'USt€€S. ‘

In appreciation of the gift, the
university will name the school
the Joseph M. Katz Graduate
School of Business.

-”Joseph Katz, an alumnus and
trustee of the University of Pitts-
burgh, has long been a dedicat-
ed and thoughtful friend of Pitt,”
said u/niversity President Wesley

‘ Posvar. ’fThis gift to the Graduate
School of Business is further evi- c

dence of his generosity to Pitt and
of his concern for the university.

Now he has established a
benchmark for commitment and

. dedication as our largest alumnus

donor. All of us at the university
are extremely grateful.”

Katz said he wants to support I

the efforts made by the Graduate
School of Business in instilling in
its students a sense of the en-
trepreneurial spirit."

”That spirit is essential to suc-
cess in business today and the

Graduate School of Business has
been getting that message to its
students,” said Katz. ’’I hope this
gift will provide the school with
some of the resources it needs to
continue to. inspire graduating
MBAs to emulate that spirit. To-

day, more than ever, large corpo-
rations as well as small firms
acknowledge the need for_ en-
trepreneurial skills in their

~ management structures. I believe

that Pitt's Graduate School of
Business is one of the best
schools in the country at advanc
ing those skills.” . '

H.J. Zoffer, dean of the busi-
ness school, said, ”We’ve had
this under discussion for a num-
ber of years. He [Katz] believed‘
the school had achieved a quali-

ty that made entrance in the very
top few schools in the country,
and he wanted tolaid the school
in meeting the challenges. He fi-
nally got to the point where he
wanted to associate his name
with the school and help us move
it forward.’-’

Zoffer also said the money will
be used to endow new professor-
ships and attract outstanding
scholars and students from all
over the world. The money will
also be used to enhance pro-
grams concerning managerial

skills and industrial competitive;

ness. The endowmentwill also
enable the school to teach stu-
dents how business is conducted
in a global economy.

”We need to have programs

' that will increase entrepreneur-
I ship and creativity,”said Zoffer.

Katz was born in Iampole, Rus-
sia in 1913, and he came ‘to the’
U.S. as an infant. He attended Pitt
from 1931 to 1934, majoring in
journalism. In 1945, he founded
Papercraft Corporation. His com-
pany ranks as a leading producer

and marketer of specialty con-‘

sumer products such as_wrapping
paper, artificial Christmas trees
and Tv-D-bol toilet bowl cleaner.

Kati was named a trustee of the
university in 1974,. elected chart-

er trustee in 1982 and trustee ,

emeritus in 1984. He is chairman

‘ of the board of visitors of the

Graduate School of Business
where he has lectured to business
students on corporate mergers
and acquisitions. Last year he
received the University's, Bicen-
tennial Medallion of Distinction.

Pitt band  
invited to
inaugural
ceremonies

By Virginia Snyder"

For The Pitt News

Beating out 16 other universi-

ties, including Penn State, Pitt's-
Varsity Marching Band has been

invited to perform at the Gover-
nor’s Inauguration on Jan. 20 in
Harrisburg. ' '

The band will travel to Harris-
burg on the 20th and perform on
the steps of the state capital prior
to and after the offical ceremony

installing Bob Casey as Governor -

of Pennsylvania. _
'The band's herald ‘trumpets
(The difference between a herald

trumpet and a trumpet is not in

the_sound, but in the construc-_

tion. The herald trumpet is along,

Harrisburg to perform at the’

governor's inaugural ball that
evening. ’ _ I '

O'Neill Sanford,‘ the .,band’fs_
director, said, ”It is a particular
honor for the Pitt Band to be per-

forming at this event because it '
only occurs every four years.” ' "

I The Honor Band for the gover-
nor’s inauguration is usually
selected from Pennsylvania state
universities, which include Pitt,
Temple and Penn State. The‘Pitt,
Band was selected to perform at

‘the ceremony by the inaugural

committee, which based the
selection on the band's perform-

ances throughout the marching ‘I

season.
Band member Glenn Roth said,
”I think it is an honor for the Pitt
Band to have been invited, espe--
cially since the Penn State_Blue
Band was not.” '
Sanford said he is pleased to be-

performing at the inauguration‘

because it will bring attention to
the university during its bicenten-
nial celebration. 1 ' A

Selections that will be ‘per-

formed includez Stars and Stripes,

the Thunderer, the National Em-

blem, Celebration and others. _
A rendition of the,PennsyIvania
Polka will be performed when

Governor Thornburg turns pow- ‘
er over to incoming Governor‘.

Band member George Bogus-' c

season, and who can beat a four-
day weekend?”

ATLANTA — Federal health
officials are trying to find out why
food poisoning with certain
Salmonella bacteria has in-
creased five-fold in nine north-
eastern states over the last
decade. J

The national Centers for Dis-
ease Control reported Thursday
that isolations of Salmonella. en-
teritidis bacteria increased about
500 percent in the New England

- states — Maine, New Hampshire,

Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island and Connecticut— and in
New York, New Jersey and Penn-
sylvania. That compares to less
than a two-fold increase for other
types. ‘

Salmonella enteritidis is one
member of the salmonella fami-

‘ Iy of bacteria, a frequent cause of

food poisoning. .
”The reasons for this increase
.are not understood,” the Atlanta-
based CDC said in its weekly
report.
Last year, investigations of
Salmonella enteritidis food

poisoning outbreaks in the North- -

east traced them to sources as
diverse as scrambled eggs, home-

Since Salmonella can get into

» 12th artificial heart

implanted at Presby

PITTSBURGH,— The twelfth
person to receive a mechanical
heart in Pittsburgh was identified
as a 38-year-old father of four
from Altoona, Pa. ‘

Wayne Showalter, a truck
driver, remained in critical con-

. dition, which is normal for such

patients, Chris Shirer, spokes-
woman for Presbyterian-Uni-
versity Hospital, said Thursday.

His identity was originally with-
held at his family's request.‘
Showalter was suffering from
an incurable weakening of his
heart. Surgeons, on Wednesday,
replaced his diseased heart with
a Jarvik-70, a small version of the
Jarvik-7. The implant was made
during a six—hour ‘emergency
operation, Shirer said.
Presbyterian—University doctors
consider mechanical hearts to be
temporary treatments, and they

plan to replace the Jarvik with a _

human heart as soon as Sho-
walter’s condition stabilizes and
a human organ is available.
The hospital has been the site
of more heart implants than any
other institution in the country.

effort to break up what they call
an illegal get-rich-quick scheme
called ’’airplane,’’ in which
recruits pay $1,500 in the hope
of making $12,000..

”This is a pyramid, a classic
pyramid,” said Douglas P. Yau-
ger, a lawyer for the state Con-
sumer Protection Bureau.

Yauger asked Allegheny
County Judge Ralph Cappy on

.Wednesday for an injunct__ion

against the scheme, and the attor-
ney accompanied other state offi-
cials Wednesday night in serving
court papers to nine suspected or-
ganizers. ‘

The airplane scheme differs
from other pyramids only in
name and price. People are en-
couraged to pay ‘$1,500 to be-

come passengers on an imaginary

airplane. They supposedly ad-
vance to become captain of the
plane and receive $12,000 from
new recruits.

Such schemes are violations of
state and federal laws.

The meetings targeted by the
agents Wednesday wereat three
motels and a restaurant in and
around Pittsburgh.

15 second earthquake
shakes ' San Salvador

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador-
A strong earthquake rattled this
Central American capital for
about 15~.se_conds Thursday
morning, causing panic among
many residents. There were no
immediate reports of deaths or in-
juries.

The quake occurred around
10:52 a.m. (11:52 a.m. EST), but
no information was immediately
available on its magnitude or
epicenter. Telephones were not
being answered by the National
Seismological Institute.

As the earth began trembling,
hundreds of people rushedinto
the streets, evacuating buildings
-— some of them already dam-
aged by a disastrous earthquake
on Oct. 10.

No astute observer could
have passed the old Pitt Tav-
ern in the past week without
at least batting an eyebrow.
Tacked on the door is a notice

' indicating that the building's
new owner, the University of
Pittsburgh, has applied for a li-
quor license. Pitt in the bar
business?

Certainly not, at least ac-
cording to university officials.

’’It is definitely not our in-
tention to open a tavern on
that sight,” said John Dutton,
vice president of business and
finance. ”The university wants

Pitt Tavern

to get the liquor license trans-
ferred from the present owner
to Pitt in order that it may be
sold. The university is not in
the business of running bars —
90 percent of our constituen-
cy is underaged.”

Dutton believes another bar
is the last thing the Oakland
area needs.

’’I think we already have an
over—density of taverns in that
immediate area,” he said.

What, then, will become of
the Pitt Tavern? After 41 years
in business, the old building
figures to play some role in
university expansion.

”Current|y,” Dutton stated,
”it [The Pitt Tavern] is in the

buy it and hold it for a year or

future university development,
possibly for dormitories.”

Dutton pointed out, how-
ever, that there is presently no
definite plan to convert the
new|y.acquired property into
student residences.

”The University of_ Pitts-
burgh never said that the Pitt
Tavern would be made into
dorms,” Dutton stated.

Flash! Computer center open

By Theresa Costello

Staff Writer

The Forbes Quadrangle Com-
puting Lab and Computer Graph-
ics Laboratory, sponsored by
Pitt's Computer and Information
System, is open to Pitt students
and faculty. V '

The new lab contains six AT&T

,. 6300 microcomputers, 12 Macin-

tosh Plus microcomputers and six

I printers in the open public access

section.
The lab also includes a class-

room which contains 30 AT&T

6300 microcomputers, and 16
printers.

With the opening of this new
facility, the number of AT&T
63005 available on campus has
risen to 156. The number of

Macintosh PLus microcomputers
is now_55.

One of the newest features of
the classroom is a new large
projection screen that is connect-
ed to the instructor's console.

Donald Gruda, an instructor for
the CGS microcomputer training
program, believes that this screen
will greatly improve the visiblity
for his students.

Gruda said that previously
small TV monitors were used,
and many people in the back of
the class couldn't see.

Another plus of the new lab is P
the atmosphere. There is new fur-

niture and enough room and
working space for each student.

Pregnancy leave

an overdue idea

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld a California law re-
quiring employers to grant unpaid sick leave of up to four
months for women unable to work due to pregnancy.

In opposition to the decision, several justices, including Wil-
liam Rehnquist, held that the law requires employers to dis-
criminate against non-pregnant women and against men. The
reasoning goes that since the law does not provide for any other
kind of mandatory leave, the remaining groups are left in the

cold.

Nothing could be further from the truth. -
It is the responsibility of the Supreme Court to interpret the
Constitution in the interest of fairness. They have done just that

' and should be commended.

Women have been discriminated_against for far too great a

portion ofour history, and any law providing for the possibili-

ty-that women have both a career and a family should be a

welcome addition to the books.

That women with careers will need different consideration
due to pregnancy is an inescapable biological fact. Men should

ly a female one.

_ The issue is not that women are being given preferential treat-
ment. They are being given different treatment. Although some

I not be brought into consideration, for the problem is inherent-

civil- rights groups would have us believe that all situations are

no argument on this point.

When the courts move against discrimination, when that
move doesn't come at the expense of another group, they

deserve our-full support.‘

but is it really art?

. .  _P_itt’s bicentennial celebration is full upon us, and there are
 f_.some questions that need to be raised. '

- Throughout the planning of the celebration, the emphasis has
been on showcasing our accomplishments of the last 200-years.

It That consideration has pervaded every aspect of the universi-

ty’s policies with the glaring exception of one.
Pitt has a well respected fine arts department. There are many
giftedartists among the student body, as is evident to anyone

I I walking through the Frick Fine Arts Building. Why, then, do _

we have a seemingly grade—school rendition of a scene from
Valley Forge on the cover of the winter time schedule?
. There is a contest each term for which students may submit

it  V I. their work for the cover. As well as having their work displayed,
* . the winning students receive a cash‘ award. The work on the

cover of the current time schedule certainly does nothing to
enhance the booklet’s appearance, not to mention that it says

nothing of Pitt's history.

The fife and drum corps is admittedly a colorful part of our

‘country's history, but it has very little to do with the history
of the university. We have 200 years of history from which to"

draw, 200 years ofsometimes remarkable accomplishments.
J A The cover of the time schedule speaks of none of these.
Such a prominent part of Pitt's literature should be graced

Naming ofthe Shres 

So, they sentenced three Mafia
leaders to 100 years each in pri-
sion. The men got what they
deserved, as decided by a jury of
their peers, and I don't have any

.problem with that. It's always

good to see justice done.

There was, however, some-
thing in the names of the men
that caught my eye. Newspapers
have a curious habit of putting a
crook/’s nickname in quotes in the
middle of his name. I have to
wonder why.

Is the practice designed to get
us all in the ”criminal state of
mind”? Are we supposed to iden-
tify these men with Hollywood
villains having names like ”Lefty”
and ”Baby face”? Is this part of
the Reagan ”let’s-make-a-movie”
method of dealing with the news?

What the hell is going on here?

In the interest of fairness, I'd
like to suggest some names to use
for other public figures when they
happen to be in the news. We
certainly wouldn't want them to
feel left out or less important than
some assorted (sordid?) criminals,
would we?

Here are my choices for this

Appeal to the stu ents

About a month ago, two repre-
sentatives of The Pitt News, Kathy
Stahl and I, were asked to attend
a meeting of the. University
Senate Student Affairs Commit-

_ tee; Disposing of words involved

in parliamentary procedure, the
committee asked to be a part
of The Pitt News.

They wanted -to be our friend.

It would seem there is a horri-
ble lack of involvement by stu-
dents in university business.
Granted, selected groups of stu-
dents are willing to build shanties
and post ridiculous requests to
”be a radical” on telephone
poles and at bus stops.

Because of the university sys-
tem, groups such as these often
go through a rather tiring, though i

 

quite loud, process of scream.ing__,

In years past, the university has
been content to let these rumbles
of discontent slowlyfade into the
background. Sadly, at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, this is often the
easiest thing to do. g

The question the representa-
tives of this paper had to ask was:
Do the students here really care
what the university does with
their money?

The only way we have of
knowing this is to put the ques- .

some events or members of the

rious confusion as to why they
are there, perhaps it is time to use
this committee forum and The

I THE PITT NEWS, Friday, January 16, I987

’ ' "-‘L: 

Lose weight fast! -— fidget the pounds away

A panel of scientists has found
that fidgeting is an important way
of burning up calories. The scien-
tists say that some people squirm
and wiggle away the equivalent
of jogging several miles each day.

The scientists — based at the
National Institute of Health in
Phoenix, Ariz. — reportedtheir
findings in the current issue of the
Journal of Clinical Investigation.
News of their discovery has been
flashed around the world by the
Associated Press.

The possible ramifications of
this research are far—reaching.
Think of all the weary hours spent
by people at running tracks and

health clubs, in an effort to lose F

weight and get in better shape.
Theoretically, all of that working
out is not even necessary. If you
fidget, you get the job done with
no pain. '

In their report, the scientists say
that fidgeting varies greatly from
person to person, and that it
seems to run in families.

Thus, if your father was a fid-
geter, you may be prone to fid-
geting too.

All of this opens up the door to

various how-to books and video- _

tapes on the subject of fidgeting.

After all, if fidgeting can burn up
calories so easily, then the non-
fidgeters of America will be hun-
gry to learn how to fidget.

Here, free of charge, is a short
course in fidgeting, brought to
you by a columnist who has been
a fidgeter all his life.

—UNBEND PAPER CLIPS IN
YOUR MOUTH- "

This is an easy fidgeting tech-
nique for beginners. You simply
take a paper clip, roll it around
in your hands for a few minutes,
and then — still holding onto one
end of it — put itlinto your
mouth. Using your teeth, you
straighten the paper clip until it
is one long, metal stick. You then
throw it at the wall.

—TAP YOUR FOOT AGAINST
YOUR DESK-

This, too, can be easily done at
your place of employment. No
matter what you are working on,
be sure to bang one or both of
your feet nervously against your
desk. There are two ways to do

this; The surreptitious way is to-

tap your feet under the bottom of
your desk, where your supervisor
will not see you. The brazen way
is to put your feet up on your
desk and repeatedly bang the

  

. . J
BOB GREENE
 

heels on the surface of the desk-.
This is considered more danger-
ous, but is immeasurably more
satisfying.

—DRUM YOUR FINGERTIPS—

This is the granddaddy of ’em
all. When you are in conversation
with friends or business associ-
ates, when you are on the tele-
phone, when you are working on
a report, take your free hand and
drum your fingertips on the
nearest convenient surface. The
more nervously and rapidly you
drum your fingertips, the better
shape you will be in. With prac-
tice, you can be drumming your
fingertips 12 to 18 hours a day
and never even notice you are

doing it.

-TOSS AND TURN IN BED-

An excellent method of fidget-
ing, and one you can master
while lying down. Do not simply
relax and wait to drift off to sleep.
Rather, adjust the pillows, thrust
yourself from one side to the
other, flip over, bend your knees,
get up to make sure the front door
is locked, bury your head under
the blankets. Performed proper-
ly, this is as beneficial to your
health as a brisk one—mile run.

—CHECK YOUR WATCH-

A vastly underrated means of
fidgeting, and one that will do
wonders to your general well-
being. Every five minutes or so,
give a sharp twist of your wrist so
that your watch comes into view.
Determine what time it is. When
another five minutes has passed,
twist your wrist again and look at
your watch again. In addition to
burning up calories, this,.js a good
way to develop Iower—arm
strength.

-CALL YOUR ‘ ANSWERING
SERVlCE- ,

No matter where you are or
how important the thing you're
doing, take time to excuse your-
self, go to a telephone and touch

base with your answering service.

(This also applies to those people I

who have phone-answering ma-
chines that they can activate from
another phone.) Don't be
soothed by the fact that when you
called 12 minutes before, you.
were assured that there had been’
no new calls. You never know

when a message might be wait- -

ing. Do not let the fact that you

are having an enjoyable time .
with friends or family rob you of '
the healthful, fidgeting routine of I

checking in with your service.

—GO TO THE WATER FOUN-
TAlN—

Thirst has nothing to do with
this. If you find yourself im-
mersed in a vital project, immedi-
ately halt what you are doing,
stand up, and proceed to the
nearest drinking fountain. This is
a wonderful fidgeting technique,
and can be repeated dozens of
times each day. This is also a
good way for school-age children
to learn to fidget.

There are dozens of other fine
ways to fidget, but you get the
picture. Start slowly with these,
and you will be on your way to
feeling better than you have in
your whole life.

Public relations could be SGB success secret

The inauguration of a new SGB
president never seems to rank
high among Pitt students as a
noteworthy occasion. Given the
choice of doing your wash or at-
tending last week's inauguration
of Phil Moyer, which activity
would you choose? Seriously?

. ‘All but one person I asked
chose laundry, which tells you a
bit about our priorities as mem-
bers of this university's com-
munity.

Pitt's Student , Government

fective or influential organization.
I rarely, if ever, hearwhat the
SGB is up to, and I can't say‘I

dent who struck me as being a
real crusader for the student
body. This is a shame, since any
elected student sitting on the

life at Pitt and confront such is-
sues as divestment and crime
with viable solutions and imple-
ment them.

I've witnessed two disturbing
problems with the SGB over the‘

from harassing me to have sex?

Also, how do I talk to them so

years. The first is that the SGB has
never communicated effectively
with the student body it repre-
sents. Rarely has the Board made
a conscious effort to inform us
about SGB activities, goals or ac-
complishments. They have not
pushed for better coverage by
The Pitt News, regularly pub-
lished a SGB newsletter for all Pitt
students, or even encouraged
boaéd members to sit down with
om undergrads in the Tow-
ers cafeteria and simply talk.
Instead, most board members
I've met only appear to uncon-
sciously pursue their own per-
sonal interests, rarely making the
effort to find out students feelings
and opinions. Therefore, -is it any
wonder why many students feel
the SGB is a"do-nothing" organi-
zation? I
The student body, however, is
guilty, too, of not trying to bridge
the SG B-students communication
gap, since we often fail _to make
the effort to bring our problems
to the SGB, or at least attend the
weekly SGB meetings.
The second major problem fac-
ing the SGB is the lack of moti-

trying to make another person
take some part in sex against her
orxhis feelings, or resistance, that
is no-class. ,

About this I agree with you en-

tirely, and the wayto stop a. man- -
from doing it is to say goodbye,"

no thanks. You make a mistake
hanging around with a persistent
male. All hanging arounddoes is
make him think that your "no”
means .”yes." To this kind of
man, if you mean "no" you
should leave so he can start on
someone else.

This is how to deal with a man
who is really a stranger, and not
one you would like to make more
of, even if he has this dumb way
of trying to get you to make love.
"Make, love” in this case is the
wrong expression; just "have
sex,” like a bologna sandwich, is

_ more like it. '

vation among Board members to

do more than their ”assigned_

work.” Elected Board officials in
the past have fulfilled their ex-
pected duties of overseeing their
student group allocation respon-
sibilities and of presenting at
board meetings the topics dis-
cussed at committee meetings.
But rarely have they made the ef-
fort to acomplish much else.

For example, when I was mak-
ing inquiries last semester around

the SGB offices in the William

Pitt Union, I found that the only
official who was doing more than
their budget allocation assign-

_ments and committee responsi-
bilites was Mary Fratis, who was,

at "the request of a group of stu-
dents, investigating the grading
policies of a professor who had
failed-a large percentage of his
class. Othen/vise, I only heard an

from "some SGB "members put in
as little time as possible" to "con—
sidering the amount of work piled

schoolwork, how can we
reasonably expect them to do
more?”

Our new SGB president Phil
Moyer has promised to institute
a campus escort service and in-
crease the student activity fee. Fi-
nally here are two ideas that
would directly affect the entire
student body, and the first visible
actions I've seen from the SGB in
two years.

But Mr. Moyer has stated that
his first priority as president is to
evaluate the organizational struc-

ture of the Board itself — an un-'.

necessary move that will take
much time and probably accom-
plish little in the way of effective
changes. I suggest that Mr. Moy-
er instead concentrate more on
keeping his Board from losing
touch with the student body they
represent. .

As a start, the SGB should im-
mediately begin pushing The Pitt
News for more coverage of SGB

You are thinking of a wonder-
ful world made just for you, and
who doesn't understand that?
And I have good news - there is
such a world, only if you find it
youwill be surprised because it
isn't really what you have been
making up in your head. It is a
real world that you share with a
man, charming but unlike any
you imagine. .

Your thinking that way mirrors
what the men are thinking of you
r— they think of you as a com-
modifY,, too, a female appear-
ance, female movement, female
flesh, that can give them release
from a certain tension. And if you
don't do that, will you just move
on, go to your choir practice and
let them continue the hunt?

You can't get to a scene where
people pair off quickly for the
‘business _. of obtaining swift

activities. The'SGB newsletter we
once had long ago should also be

reinstated. Finally, if-Mr. Moyer '

truly has the leadership-qualities

to institute progress, he should. ' 
continuously motivate his Board   ~'
g to seek out student opinions and "

problems and encourage any
SGB officer to pursue goals out-
side their own responsibilities...-If,
the work is too demanding,
recruit outside undergraduate stu-

dents to_ help with the burden’ of I I I ll

responsibilities.

Hopefully, each week Mr.
Moyer will remind himself and

his board that they are’ not in the I ._
elected positions they currently “ i

hold for the purpose of heighten-

ing their personal status or self es- _ ‘

teem. They were elected to serve
the student body. And if the SGB
chooses to truly serve us this year
with visible progress and beneﬁts,
they will be richly rewarded_with

our respect and admiration. If ‘

not, well then, nothing will be_
gained. But I hope Bill, Vince, Fi-

ora and the rest of the new Board A .'A-_{
will never permit themselves to -

let that happen.

If you want a restrained, lover,  
look at restrained men. The fact"

that a man is not licking his lips

doesn't mean he has no interest
in women. , . -

these problems,” he said.

Prevention efforts are one com-
ponent of the program.
”Teenagers are very often the first

Another aspect in which STAR

Reader s Poll

The year was 1 986, and the place was America. Probably the
biggest event of the year was the unveiling of the.renovated Statue
of Liberty. Although most of us heard for too much of the event
because of a media blitz and excessive endorsements (even beer
companies claimed that they were proud supporters), it was a
monumental event, one that will be long remembered. The year
suffered a severe setback in the space program; and an even more
severe ‘setback in George Bush's political career. There were also,
of course, memorable deaths, births and marriages. The year,
though, when looking at it as a whole, was ius nother year.
’ The year in entertainment was somewhatidull — 5 me may even
say unmemorable — but there were bright spots. Woody Allen
had a huge hit with Hannah and Her Sisters, as did David Lynch
with Blue Velvet. Paul Newman reprised the role of ”Fast Eddie"

-Felsen; Sigourney Weaver was again fighting aliens (this time

plural); and the Star Trek crew came home. All this happened in
great sequels. Musically, Paul Simon hit another high point in his
career," as did Steve Winwood and Peter Gabriel‘. Bon Jovi and
Boston put rock back on the charts with successful albums, and
Run D.l\/l.C. proved that rap music and pop success are not neces-
sarily incompatible. While Whitney Houston provided hits of the
smooth variety, Janet Jackson filled in for her brother in making
music news. ln literature, Stephen King and Robert Ludlum topped
the fiction charts, while Bill Cosby wrote of fatherhood and Frank
Sinatra was written about.

See page 9...

Disappointments forthe year are easy to forget and usually do
not get much attention. Let us not forget those movies such as
Heartburn, Short Circuit, [ego/~ Eag/es and Three Amigos that
seemed sure to please but served only to disappoint. Tina‘ Turner

couldn't match her last effort; Bob Dylan bombed; and some one—..

time platinum acts like Quiet Riot, Joan Jett and Elton John had
releases this year that seemed to fall on deafears; ' ' 1' "
But what about you, our faithful reader? We are hoping that

there are more than two of you although, we can't be sure. We 1

here in the entertainment department would like to know how you,

‘ felt about the year. The ballot is simple and straightforward, so

hopefully a lot of you will take a few minutes to_fill it out. If you
notice, we are asking for favorites this year since best and worst
seem to encompss too broad a range. We want favorites from
your experience, not necessarily what critics (dare we say the
word) think. You can drop off your ballots in The Pitt News office
or in the designated box at the main desk of the William Pitt Union.
The results will be printed in a future ”Showcase." In the mean-
time, have a great.1987 from everyone here at ”Showcase.-"

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, January‘ 16, I987

9‘/2 hour epic

By James Crary
and Justin Vicari

lt was a brutally long film. Yet
2 V2 years of genocide is a for-
bidding topic. A 9 V2 hour film
can barely summarize the extent
of the atrocity. You leave
Claude Lanzmann’s film, 5/ioah,
with a feeling that nothing has
been resolved, but at least at-
tempts have been made to ex-

press the degradation of

humanity at Chelmno, Birkenau,
Auschwitz and Treblinka.

ln two 4 "/2 hour segments,
Lanzmann interviews eyewit-
nesses, including survivors and

personnel from the death camps."

Lanzmann edited ten years of

documentary footage into tes— V
. timony about the holocaust and

the behavior of individuals in,
what Bruno Bettelheim called,
”extreme situations."

The testimony sometimes
seems incongruous in its dignity.
Even the Jews in Special Detail
and Nazi bureaucrats were able

Review:
 Shouh

to redeem their dignity by bear-
ing testimony. Some wept and
would not have spoken at all
had Lanzmann’s presence not
been so insistent on breaking
down the barrier of silence.

In this sense, Lanzmann as a
producer, director and inter-
viewer played the roles of hind-
sight and I conscience. So
demanding is the need to know
in truth and accuracy about the
death’ camps that when Lanz-

fmann violates the privacy of the

former" Nazis it seems heroic.
This violation involved confront-
ing them with their past, often
when filming with hidden
cameras.

The first section involved the
return to Chelmno by Simon Sre—_

-bik, one of only two Jewish sur-
vivors ‘ at that ‘camp. As a“
l3-year-old prisoner, he was a »
constant presence, he survived

only by entertaining the Nazis

with songswhich they taught 1
him. All the old Polish women

alive today in the town of
Chelmno remember him as the
little Jew in leg irons who song
on the ri.ver. Srebik seemed
heavy and removed fromglife but
capable of smiling mildly; at their
recognition. The only other sur-
vivor wore a constant grin re-
moved only abruptly when he
wept. This smile annoyed Lanz-
mann who asked him to explain.
But how could he?

_ The inability to express was a
constant theme as language
seemed to fail each witness — as

in the words of one who said, ”l .

don't think the tongue can han-
dle the horror." There were
those for whom the memory was
a chance to ioke, as in the Poles
whospied on the_death camps
for fu'n,';trying to_ Outmaneuver

_h th_e‘_Ukra_fnian ‘guards who fired at.

  

  depicts Nazi horror

them. There were those who ex-
aggerated their own signifi-
cance, for example, the Pole
who bragged that he slipped
Jews water. But more often it
was a memory of relentless grief
which seemed to flood the dams
of language.

The bureaucrats called Treb-
linka "a concentration camp."
The Gestapo called it ”a
production line of death.” The
most accurate term would seem
to be "death camp." Himme/-
sweg or ”the road to heaven”
was the most dreadful euphe-
mism at all.

That the situation was heart-
-less cannot be contested, yet the
Warsaw Ghetto was said to be
”the heart of the city," and the

‘gas chambers were said to be

”the heart of the camp." The
paradox of death and the heart
almost explains this incredible in-
sensitivity.

The tension is between life and

death: how to survive, how_the .
Jewish work-detail take death
. into their hearts in order to sur-

vive. ”Our lives depended on

-the slaughtering process," said

one surviving Jew. The deepest
level of degradation was that
people were forced to be insen-
sitive to the suffering of others.
But such inadequacy to explain

V is the inescapable theme. There

was no complete emotional sur-
vival for these people who never
got beyond what happened to

them. For both the inmates and '

the guards-, innocence was
crushed to the point where _they
seemed to be living in a moral
vacuum. How can survivors be
judged? Without these survivors,
there would not even have been

. testimony. Lanzmann doesn't at-
tempt to assign blame. -It seems -

that blame can only lead to

more death.

.The last 45 minutes were

about Cherniakov who was the

Jewish Commissioner Of‘ the

- Warsaw Ghetto. He tried to ap-

pease the Nazis and was vio-
lently betrayed by them. Until
the day of his suicide, he kept a
diary in which he tried to record
the small triumphs of the human
spirit.

The viewer becomes an eye-
witness to the incredible facts,
hard to express and impossible
to deny. ‘Many of the witnesses

seem less despicable because ,

they are typical, even predicta-

gble. Yehuda Amichai, the

greatest poet yvriting in Hebrew
today, once asked of» himself



"half the people love, half the . -

people hate, and where is my
place between these halves that
are so well matched?” After
watching Shoot), it becomes our
responsibility -to find our place.
If people can come away hop-
ing, rather than despising, we
can know their place between

I these halves so well matched.
brutally ‘

Truth, such as

documented in this film, ‘almost ’ -

redeems the living. For the dead

there is only the inexpressible 

f_grief.-_A_ A _.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, January 16, T987

De Niro takes up the
sword, but he oan’t help

By Douglas W. Payne

The Mission is an intensely ab-
sorbing film which chronicles the
true story of insurmountable
odds in the battle of human wills.
Although such a neat summary
could easily size up a great deal
of recent films, director Roland
Joffe's epic seems to document
the ceaseless and extraordinary
efforts of human motivation and
the abysmal futility of that effort.
Such was the plight of Sisyphus.

The Ki//ing Fie/a’s, Joffe's mo-
tion picture debut and previous
work, portrayed how the
ravages of a senseless war can
unite two strangers from two
different worlds in a manner
which proved that a spiritual
bond is far deeper and more
compelling than loyalties to king
and country. Joffe's gift lies in
the battle between the spirit of
man and mankind itself. Such a
battle must always manifest itself
in war, such as in the Vietnam
War of The Ki//ing Fie/ds, or ter-
ritorial battles, such as that
which occurs in The Mission.
However, there's so much more
to _The A/lission than portraying

Review:
The Mission

The anguish and ecstacy of sim-
ple, albeit fragile, human emo-
tions. Yet its impact is lost on
some breathtaking cinematogra-
phy. Were it not for some cap-
tivating visual sequences, The

- /\/liss/‘on would sadly be victim to

a perfunctory script reeking of

.. simple ideas and silly cliches.

lnitially, The Mission concerns
two intruders; Rodrigo Mendo-
za (ineptly performed by the
otherwise brilliant Robert De
Niro), a slave trader and merce-
nary, and Father Gabriel (Jere-
my lrons). Both men intrude upon
the Guaranilndian tribe buried
in the forests of South America
above the lguazu Falls. Mendo-
za's intent is capturingslaves,
and Father Gabriel seeks to es-
tablish-the Mission T of San
Carlos. This provides the Guara-

ni with sanctuary and, in turn,“

they learn to farm, read and
write in their own language,
handcraft fine violins and, in es-
sence, become self—sufficient.

Mendoza later discovers that
his younger brother, Felipe
(played by Aidan Quinn in a
shamefully small role), is having
an affair with Mendoza’s girl-
friend. Out of anger, Mendoza
kills Felipe and discovers he can
no longer bear the burdens of his
soul. This was the final act of hu-
man iniustice he was capable of
committing and the most tragic.
It then becomes Father Gabriel's
task to lead Mendoza to the
path of redemption.

It is here where the film really
begins, as we witness the moral
struggles between the men. lt is
also the point where the film be-
gins to fall apart. The first half of
the film spends such a great deal
of time lamenting the moral
struggles within men, that it
almost seems absurdly naive
that Joffe explore the struggle of

morality between men. lf it is
also atthis point where the film
becomes obvious in its scope
and intent, it is here, then, where
The Mission becomes an enig-
matic visual spectacle.

Here is where The /\/lission be-
comes lifeless and superficial.
Mendoza achieves such a vivid
and dramatic catharsis, that it is
almost unfathomable the. au-
dience remains untouched by his
character at the end of the
movie. It could be De Niro's
nearly catatonic performance as
a cold, ruthless mercenary who
becomes a cold lump of convert-
ed clay. His emotions are ex-
pressed so predictably that it
almost looks like a parody.

Perhaps, also, Ennio Morri-
cone's vividly obvious musical
score is at fault as well. The
composer of scores for The
Good, The Bad and The Ug/y
and A Fisf7‘u/ of Do//ars is wildly
overstating in Dolby now. lt’s as
if he's saying ’,'tense soul
searching,” ”unabashed ioy"
or ”eminent danger" the way
the director holds up "ap-
plause" cards at a live television
show.

Such .a genuine and honest
account of history should merit
not only an authenticity, which

The /\/lission does, but an integri— ,

ty as well; Jotte's attempts are
noble but, finally, he has creat-
ed a beautiful cinematic near-
shot. The Mission lacks the
pathos to convince the audience
of its emotions. ln the end, this

. is where the movie unfortunate-

ly fails: Robert Bolt’s (of Doctor
Zh/vago and lawrence ofAro-
bio fame) script is tedious and
minimalizing in its philosophy,
and the acting boils down to
some very Hollywood-ish
production numbers. When the
acting isn't affably unaffected, it
is merely proficient, and when
the scenes aren't gripping roller-
coaster rides through awe and
wonderment, The Mission be-
comes a philosophical yarn with
very little depth.

Please, however, don't be
scared away from seeing this
film if you like exciting, visually
compelling cinema. Chris
Menges, The A/lission’s director
of photography, deserves an
Oscar for his visual work on the
film; many memorable scenes
abound throughout The Mission
‘with vicariously intense frequen-
cy. lt is his brilliant work which
will leave you awestruck as you
exit the theater, despite the
realization that Joffe has made

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, January I6, I987

By David Zuchowski

When the eccentric baroque
composer Antoine Forqueray
published some of his composi-

cal critics complained that it was
a foolish thing to do —- foolish
because absolutely no one
could play them except Forque-
ray and his son.

In fact, Forqueray’s works
were branded as "devilishly”
difficult, and this is the explana-
tion for half of the title of a con-
cert to be played at Synod Hall
on Saturday, Jan. l7.

This performance of Music's
Recreation, the baroque
ensemble"-in—residence with the
Renaissance and Baroque Soci-
ety, is called ”Angels and
Devils.” The composer claims

tions for the viola do gamba, lo-,

the "angel" half of the titleis ‘

Classical

lvlarin Morals, who regularly
won accolades for his lyrically
beautiful, even angelic, compo-
sitions.

Just _to stretch the figure of

-speech a bit further, the two

composers’ reputations tend to
match thedescriptions —. espe-
cially Forqueray, a bit of a rake
who divorced his wife and ex-
iled his son.

Viola do gambist Laura Jeppe-
son, guest artist for this concert,
plays with the Bosto_n lvluseum
Trio, the Boston Camerata and
the Amsterdam-based Orches-
tra of the l8th Century. Also a
professor at the New England
Conservatory, Jeppeson is"
remembered locally for her per-
formance last year with Music's
Recreation in their ”Baroque

lvlusical Banquet.”

She will be ioining.John Dor-

Viola da gamba 

nenburg, Music's Recreation’s
viola do gambist, to feature this
7-string instrument so popular in
baroque times. The concert will

give a rare starring role to the _

bass string sounds of the viola do
gamba, which actually has a
wider range than a cello, both

‘deeper and higher.

Other members of the ensem-
ble are Louise Carslake, who
plays the wooden baroque
flute, and Jillon S. Dupree, harp-
sichordist. The flute will be fea-
tured in a Leclair sonata and a
Telemann quartet.

The concert will take place at
8 p.m. on Jan. l7 in Synod Hall,

tion, call The Renaissance and

DANEE SPARTYT -
The Untoucables
MCA Records

By Michael Fay

Sometimes record albums are
a lot like laundry detergent.
They sit there on the shelf with
big, bright stickers declaring
them: new or specially priced.
And as is the case with deter-
gent, the smart consumer is not
taken in. He probes further. He
discovers that Dance Party is not
the "new" Untouchables record
but a repackaging of their last
one.

It is a six-song, extended—play
record including no previously
unrecorded material and every
gimmick in the book. There are

g three.fashionably extended re-

re—re-mixes, two live perform-
ances (recorded during last

year's spring break at Daytona.

Beach) and a cover version of
the ‘often covered ''(I'm not
your) Steppin' Stone."

Like their first MCA release
W/'/a’ Ch/'/d, source of five origi-
nal songs, Dance Party is a com-
petent and polished record with
some potential for mass appeal.
Any one of these songs would
be a welcome addition to a
teen—movie soundtrack album.

Butalso, like theirfirst release, it -

could easily be called too
polished, even restrained.

The Untouchables, who
formed in Los Angeles in I98l,
represent the very tail end of
and America's only notable con-
tribution to a British pop
phenomenon called ska. Ska,
embodied by bands like The
Specials, The Beat, Bodysnatch-
ers and Selector, was, in part, a
reaction to racial tension and
violence in urban Britain in the
late '70s and early '80s. It
stressed the integration of blacks
and whites. The band members
were of different races, the lyr-
ics spoke of toleration and the
music drew from a combination
of musical styles including reg-

gae, soul, funk and '50s-style _

rock 'n' roll.

But today, after ska's pioneers “

have dispersed into either the
mainstream or obscurity, only a
few minor players like the Un-
touchables have insisted on car-
rying the torch. The flame has
long been out, but the form ‘—
the sound and ‘image — may still
be economically viable in the
states. A’

Side one is the most commer-
cially palatable. I include two
heavily rap-influenced songs:
"Freak in the Street" and "Hey
UT's." These are both well per-
formed and produced but heav-
ily cliched (even for rap) and
unnecessarily redundant. "Step-
pin' Stone," made famous by
the Monkees, is performed so

; slickly that it actually sounds

genenc.

Side two is again well done
but uncompelling. While the gui-
tar and drum rhythm tracks are
tightly wound and upbeat, there

is no one thing that distinguish-
es the music aside from a few
recycled, lead-guitar runs. These
songs may sound at home blast-
ing from the dance floor of an

"Animal House," butthey have .
little dance-hit potential in these

days of Madonna.

Sure, some people will buy
Dance Party even after they

read the fine print. But for those .

of you who aren't either wealthy
or die hard UT fans, I'll say there
is nothing "new," "special" or
even "improved" about this Un-
touchablesuproduct. More than
likely, it was conceived of as a
promotional tool contrived by
MCA to stir up some interest in
the band before their next real
release. I

  

EVER AFTER
The Three O’c|ock
I.R.S. Records

By John Young

The Three O'Clock's major
label debut Arrive Without

Trove//ing offered much more '

than the '60s revivalism that

 

came into vogue with themedia

ascent of the paisley under-‘

ground. From the inherently
hummable "Her Head's Revolv-
ing" to the engrossing "Spun
Gold," the album displayed
smart pop craftsmanship by

‘primary songwriters Michael

Quercio and Louis Gutierrez.
The quality of the band's last
record makes their new release
Ever After all the more disap-
pointing.

Guitarist Gutierrez has been
replaced by Steven Altenberg
on the new LP, and Gutierrez's
departure seems to have helped
facilitate a maior overhaul of the
band's sound. Altenberg plays
an occasional tasteful solo and
adds some texturing in places
but does nothing more on Ever

Showing no mercy

By John Mccombe

The makers of No Mercy at-
tempt to enhance the sensuality
of Michel Duval (Kim Basinger)
by keeping her watered down
and covered with slimy swamp
residue. However, no attempt is
made to enhance the intelli-
gence of ”tough Chicago cop"
Eddie Jillette (Richard Gere)
who delivers plenty of hard-
boiled but hardly inspired dia-
logue. Do Chicago cops really
decline to "swap spit” on such
a regular basis?

Jillette vows to avenge the
death of his partner who was

killed by the knife of a bayou
country kingpin named Losadol
(Jeroen Krabbe). Jillette also
feels‘ compelled to free the
animalistic grace of Michel, who
has been ”possessed" by Lasa-
do since the age of T3.

The star chemistry between
Gere and Basinger is strictly of
the cookbook variety. Once the
action departs from the" stock-
yards of Chicago for the red
light district of New Orleans, the
unbelievable ignorance of Loso-

‘do's combatants makes No

Mercy unmercifully lengthy.
You'll probably have more fun

THE PITT NEWS

By John Enright
Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers did every-
thing they could to try to give this
one away. They really did.

Among their many miscues in
the final minutes of Wednesday
night's away game against the Se-
ton Hall Pirates were:

0 Curtis Aiken’s _ill-advised
25-foot jumper, which missed
badly, with Pitt down by one
point at the five minute mark.

0 Charles Smith picking up his
fourth personal foul with just over
15 minutes to play. The call sent

Smith to the bench for the next.

ten minutes and he eventually
fouled out at :31.”
0 Consecutive missed one-and-

one attempts by Aiken and point
guard Mike Goodson in the final
30 seconds of the game.

But Pitt just couldn't find a way
to lose this one, as it held on to
defeat the Pirates 87-85.

The 12-3 Panthers didn't know
how to win games in the clutch
last season, but the situation is
much different with this year's
Pitt team. ~

- ”To be honest with you,” said
Panther forward Demetreus
Gore, ”last year we probably
would have lost this game. But
this year we're pulling together as
a unit, rather than going our own
separate ways.”

And Gore was the one who put
Pitt on direct course, securing the
win against the Pirates (10-4) with

clutch free-throw shooting in the
last three minutes. Gore hit his
last seven foul shots, six in the fi-
nal 3:19, to give the Panthers
their second Big East win of the
year. Seton Hall is 1-4 in the con-
ference.

‘ For most ofthe game, especial-
ly the final two minutes, Pitt re-
fused to take command of the
Pirates. The Panthers had a 35-28
lead with five minutes left in the
first half, only to watch Seton Hall
go on a 17-10 run to tie the game
at halftime, 45 a piece.

The player who kept the Pirates
in the game was a flu-ridden, but
sensational guard — sophomore
James Major. Major scored 30
points for Seton Hall, including
19 in the first half and he could

have been the difference in the
game. But  he sat out four
minutes of the second half be-
cause he threw up on the court.

”I didn't think Major could hurt
us that badly,” said Pitt coach
Paul Evans. ”We slowed him
down after he puked.”

Meanwhile, Seton Hall regulars
Martin Salley, Mark Bryant and
Frantz Volcy all fouled out for the
Pirates.

The Panthers had similar
problems keeping the’ir big men
on the floor as forward Jerome
Lane and center Tico Cooper, in
addition to Smith, each exited the
game due to fouls.

The referees called 56 per-
sonals in the game and the differ-
ence was at the foul. stripe. Pitt

Surprise

Goodson emerges as solid
fifth player for Panthers

By Jim Urban
Editor—in—Chief \

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -
Going into Wednesday night's
Seton Hall—Pittsburgh game,
Seton Hall coach P.J. Carlesi-
.mo and Pittsburgh coach Paul
Evans both were sure of one
thing: the Pitt basketball team
has four players -— Demetreus
Gore,‘ Charles Smith, Jerome
Lane and Curtis Aiken — who
can play basketball.

When the game was over,
they knew something else.

There is a fifth player on the‘

court for Pitt who can play,
and his name is Michael
Goodson.

Goodson, the sophomore
point guard from Elizabeth,
N.J., rebounded from his
benching against Duquesne
Monday night, and solidified
his hold on Pitt's point guard
spot

After playing only eight
minutes against Duquesne,
Goodson played the entire 40

minutes Wednesday night,‘

scoring 19 points on 10,of 11
shooting, and handing out five
assists. Pitt held off Seton Hall
for an 87-85 victory.
”Obviously, we did not ex-
pect Michael Goodson to do
that,” said Seton Hall coach
P.J. Carlesimo. ”We knew he

was a good player, but‘ we

tried to put the emphasis on
the four players that had car-
ried Pitt all season.”

And that is where Seton
Hall got hurt.

The Pirates had several
chances to develop,a strong’
lead over «the Panthers in the
first half, but it was Goodson
every time who kept the Pan-
thers close. He was nine of
nine from the field in the first
half,- including three three-

‘point field goals. His 17-footer

sent the Panthers into the lock-
erroom at halftime tied at
45-45..

”Michael Goodson really
gave us a lift in the first half,”
Pitt coach Paul Evans said af-
ter the game. ”He kept us in
the game. Every time they
started to pull away, he hit a
bucket that keptus close.”

For Goodson, who was
playing’ in‘ front. of a
hometown crowd, it couldn't‘
have been sweeter.

”When I hit the first shot, it
was like  ahhh,” Goodson
said. ”I relaxeda little bit.
When I hit the second, I knew
I was hot. I said ’gimme the
ball.’ ”

Goodson’s 19 points were a
career high. — .

”If he could play like that .
every night, it would be
great,” Evans said. ”It would
solve a lot of problems.”

Women end losing streak

By Matt O'Hara
Staff "Writer

The Lady Panther basketball
team beat Cleveland State
72-63 on Wednesday, ending
a five-game losing streak.

”No one player really stood
out,” said assistant coach Kim
Basick. ”We played tough col-
lectively; everybody did what
they had to do.”

Pitt went to the locker room
down by five at halftime
39-34. However, the second
half belonged to the Lady

, Panthers.

”We kept attacking the ball,
and we played a lot smarter
than we have been,” added
Basick. ‘
Although down by nine at
one point, Pitt outscored
Cleveland State by 14 in the

second half. Maybe more im-
portant is the fact that CSU did
not get to the foul line, while
Pitt made six of nine in the fi-
nal 20 minutes.

Junior forward Sally Sheerer,
who, despite the game scores,
has been somewhat impres-
sive this season, led the Lady
Panthers in scoring with 17.
Guards Valerie Halesworth
and Jen Shingler were also in
double figures with 15 and 12
points, respectively. Cleveland
State forward Jill Harris led all
scorers with 25.

Pitt dominated the boards,
pulling down 45 rebounds to
Cleveland State's 34. Sheerer
had 13, while Tabby Long and
Jane Plake combined for 16
more.

The victory was only the
fourth of the season and the
first since Dec. 22 for Pitt. The

Lady Panthers have now- won
four of nine games outside the
Big East.

Unfortunately, they are
winless in five attempts in the
conference. Losing already to
Georgetown, Connecticut, Vil-

lanova, Syracuse, and Boston . .

College, the Lady Panthers
have 11 more trys in the Big
East. if any hope should be
regained as to a placement in
the conference, these 11
games are going to have to be
mandatory wins.

The Lady Panthers return to
Big East play Saturday evening
at 5:30 against St. John's
University at Fitzgerald Field
House.

’’I don't think we've ever

beaten St. John's,” said Basick.
”On paper, we're a better
team — too bad that doesn't
mean much...”

look for

another win

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
is off to an incredible 6-0 start,
with two very impressive wins in
the last consecutive meets.

Last Saturday, the Panthers
visited Lehigh University and
returned with a 35-10 win over
the No. 10-ranked team in the
nation.

”The Lehigh meet was a total

team effort,” said Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer. ”They got six

of their pointswhen we forfeited '

the heavyweight division, and the
rest came on two ties. We really
did dominate.”

The next day, Pitt visited
Millersville and again was victori-
ous with a win of 33-5.

”That was another big winfor
us,” said Stottlemyer. ”We only
lost one match. Millersville is not
ranked, but they are an up-and-
coming team. They were real
fighters.”

Stottlemyer continued, ”The
stars of the weekend had to be
Eric Wertz, Gary Bolin, Billy
Lewis and Matty Gehart. Yet,

"overall the whole team did a

great job.”

This weekend the Panthers host
Ashland College from Division II.
”They may not be a Division I
team, but they are stong,” Stott-
lemyer said. ”They will make us
work for all that we can get. I
hope to see a lot of people in the
stands to cheer us on.”,

Gymnasts meet EMU

By Sharon Haney

Sta ff Writer

The Pitt men’s gymnastics
team will have their first meet
of the new year tomorrow,
hosting Eastern Michigan at 2
p.m. in Trees Hall.

Junior Jorge Sanchez stated,
”This is an important meet for
us because it will set the tone
for the season. It will give us
a chance to see where we
are.”

Coach Frank D’Amico is
hopeful that his young team
will perform well. ’’If we hit
our routines like we have in
practice, we have the potential
to score in the high 250s,” he
said.

The Panthers, however, are
plagued with problems. Two
gymnasts recently left, and

two of their top performers are
injured. Sanchez, who missed
the first meet with a back in-
jury, said, ”This is my first
competition since last year, so
I'm a little nervous. But I'm
looking forward to it.”

Ben Rovee, a senior co-
captain, recently had shoulder
surgery and will most likely
miss the rest of the season. But
he will be helping Coach
D’Amico. Rovee feels that the
floor exercise is the Panthers
strongest event and expects
good performances from the
whole team.

Coach D’Amico feels that
the Eastern Michigan Hurons

will provide good competition.

since there shouldn't be much
pressure on a good yet ailing
team ——- which is the situation
Pitt seems to be in.

Strauss placed into key position

By Stephanie Megill

Staff Writer

Who was it who said that fresh-
men athletes need time to adapt
to the demands of college life?

Well, whoever it was couldn't
prove it by freshman gymnast Sue
Strauss. Strauss and junior Kim
Calderone will compete as the
two all-arounders in the Lady
Pathers’ meets this weekend.

One of the reasons that it is
complimentary for Strauss to be
so well—prepared heading to New
Hampshire and Rhode Island this
weekend is that she was not able
to compete last year due to both
orthroscopic and regular surgery
on her right ankle. As well, Pitt

,decided to give Strauss a full
scholarship without actually see--

ing her compete. She now feels
she has ”to prove them [Pitt] right
and prove myself worthwhile to

the team.”

”Sue’s strong‘ comeback is be-
cause of her strong work ethic,”
said women's gymnastics head
coach Debbie Yohman. ”Sue has
a lot of motivation and doesn't
get discouraged.”

Yohman also said she has no
misgivings about giving Strauss
such a prestigious position in her
first meet in over a year.

”A lot of that has to" do with
how she competed at IUP, espe-
cially on beam,” said Yohman.
’’It is very easy to become ner-
vous when doing beam, but Sue
moved through her routine with

poise.”

Although Strauss said that she
does not enjoy competing beam,
it has always been one of her
highest scores.

’’I get nervous before and dur-
ing beam,” said Strauss. ’’I like to
compete vault because it's over
quickly, but beam seems to
drag.”

Yohman said she feels Strauss
to be one of the best beam work-
ers currently on Pitt's team.

”Sue works hard everywhere,
and she never does anything half-
way  from schoolwork to gym-
nastics to her family life,” said
Yohman. ”l feel that her dedica-
tion is a direct reflection on her
family.”

Not only is Strauss a dedicated
gymnast, but she is also a highly
motivated student. As a nursing
major, her schedule is basically
determined by her advisers. Be-
cause of this, her classes often
coincide with scheduled team
workouts. To get’ in enough train-
ing time, Strauss’ practices early
Monday mornings and late Tues-
day nights without her team-
mates. Even with this difficult
schedule, Strauss made a 3.5

    

QPA in her first semester at Pitt.

Strauss likes very much what
she has done in gymnastics.
However, she is quick to respond
when asked what her least favor-
ite and least heralded event is —
vault.

’’I am not a strong vaulter,” she
said. ”ln all the events, I have to
make up with technique what I
don't have in strength. I'm better
at dance.”

Strauss chose to come to_ Pitt for
a variety of reasons. First, Pitt is
close to her home, and although
she said she cannot study there,
she does enjoy visiting as often as
possible. Secondly, Strauss said
that Pitt's medical program is one
of the best in the nation. Next,
Pitt's gymnastics team would give
her a chance to compete through-
out college. And finally, Sue likes
the city life.

’’I couldn't imagine going to a
school away from the city,” she
said. ”lt wouldn't be fun.”

As for Yohman’s expectations
of Strauss and the rest of the team
this weekend, she said, ”These
meets will let us know what we
can do when West Virginia [Uni-
versity] comes next week.”

Along with Strauss and Calder-
one, Yohman is also taking Cathy
Coleman, Teresa Garcia, Lee Ann
Vaughn, Beth Waters, Trish Aser,
Hope Celani, Jenna Hunter and
Shelly Sleith.

Waters and Garcia will only
compete bars due to ankle inju— »
ries. Freshman Hunter will make
her collegiate debut by compet-
ing floor for the Lady Panthers- —

Yohman is allowing an exhibi-
tion routine on each event, and

» she said that the Lady Panthers

have ”the potential to do really
well.”
