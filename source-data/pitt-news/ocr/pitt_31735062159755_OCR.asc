Freshmanl and Veteran
Figures Hit Hardest

A cautious J. G. Quick, University registrar, has declin-
ed to make a deﬁnite prediction on expected enrollment ﬁg-
ures for the coming semester but he has ventured these state-

ments:

A decrease is anticipated in freshman enrollment as

well as throughout the whole

University.

No change is expected.in en-¢
rollment in the professional
schools.

He said that part-time’enroll-
ment, both graduate and under-
graduate, should “hold up well by
comparison with last year.”

Good Jobs A Factor

Dr. Quick also stated that the
present high employment in out-
side industry may lure some of
the upperclass undergrads away
from the schoolroom.

William F. Saalbach, assistant
to the dean of men, also painted a
picture of dropping enrollments in
his department-veterans. He ex-
pects between 5,000 and 5,500 vet-
erans to attend classes this year;
That compares with a rough esti-
mate of 6,00-0 last year.

Final ﬁgures, however, will not
be available until after registra-
tion.

16,000 Kits Mailed

The crowd should not be quite
so large at registration this year,
either. The registrar’s ofﬁce has
sent out about 16,000 pre—registra-
tion kits this year, a drop of about
1,337 from last year's ﬁgure.

As last semester, registration is‘
being held in the basement of the

First Open House Since.1937

 

I   Mellon Institute Opens Doors

.‘v\_ I.

2"

For the ﬁrst time since the dedication of its building in°

1937, Mellon Institute will be open for public inspection on
Saturday and Sunday, September 15 and 16.
Held in observance of National Chemistry Week, and to

mark completion of new researché

and administrative facilities, the
Open House will feature tours, ex-
hibits, and demonstrations, all
aimed at explaining the work of
the Institute. _
Exhibits Many and Various

Visiting hours are 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. on Saturday, and 1 to 6 p.m.
on Sunday.

Over ﬁfty exhibits which dem-
onstrate research on a great. vari-
ety of industrial products and pro-
cesses have been prepared by the

. Institute fellowships.

They range, according to the In-
stitute, from Artists’ Materials and
Bone Products. through Grinding
Wheels and Industrial Hygiene to
Tar Constituents and Watch Tech-
nology.

Researchers To Demonstrate

Institute members will be pres-
entduring the’Open House to ex-
plain their exhibits and demon-
strate some of the research tech-
niques of modern science.

‘At the Institute’s last Open
House, in 1937, 25,000 Pittsburgh-
ers toured the newly completed
building.

At that time about 20% of the

building was left incomplete to
provide for future expansion.
Facilities Completed

In 1948 construction was begun
on the incomplete section, and the
facilities ﬁnished since then will
be on display. ' _

Among them are 32 large and
small laboratories, 17 offices and
service rooms, and an extensive,
air-conditioned periodical room
and offices for the library.

Also on exhibit will be’ several
special research projects which the
Institute is doing for government
agencies such as the Air Forces
Research Laboratories, the Quar-
termaster General, and the Oﬂice
of Rubber Reserve, RFC. _

President Comments

Commenting on the Open House
week-end, Dr. Edward R. Weid-
lein, President of the Institute,
said, “since Mellon Institute is one
of the country’s outstanding exam-
ples of science applied to ‘sherbet-
terment of human welfare, it is
most ﬁtting that the public be
welcomed here during National

Chemistry Week.” '

An Obligation ~-

Each year at this time the editor is called upon, or
feels, called upon, to make a statement of policy" for the
impending year. If he elects to repond, his expression is
either vague and meaningless or it consists of a, detailed
list of technical publication rules. He is only fulﬁlling what
he regards as an obligation.

The impossibility of saying today where you will stand
tomorrow on an issue which has not yet arisen, and which
may not arise, makes any statement of policy absurd. Then,
too, what you favor today you might well oppose tomorrow.

It would be easy to say that we are for the campus’
equivalents of God and Country and let it go at that. But.
it takes little learning and less observation to know that
a great many crimes are committed in the name of these

sterling vritues. We shall not join the hypocrites.

The only wise way to determine policyon a given issue
is to wait until it has arisen. Then we will take our stand
in light of its merits and demerits as we see it. Our ap-
proach will be tempered by the guidance offered from sim-
ilar situations in the past \and by the assistance of an or-

- ganized and able staff.

‘ We hope that most of our editorials will be true re-
ﬂections of student opinion. Where they run counter to

tinued at top speed.

The Athletic Department has
already started moving office
equipment into the new ﬁeld-
house. The Athletic Building will
be turned into a dormitory for Pitt
football players.

Plans now call ‘for dedication

The $117§ million structure will
be used for indoor track, basket-

ball, and wrestling. During in-V

clement weather the football squad
will also drill there. .

The WPIAL sectional basket-
ball elimination series will also
be held in the ﬁeldhouse. As yet
it has not been decided if the
high school state basketball ﬁnal
will be held in Pittsburgh or
Philadelphia. ‘

The Stadium gym ﬂoor is be-
ing remodeled for intramural use.
It is hoped that basketball, hand

can be reeled off at the Stadium
this winter. ’

Edgar Jones,
Hefferle Back
As Coaches

Edgar Jones, former Pitt All-
American who led the Panthers
down the victory path in the early
forties, was picked by coach Tom
Hamilton forthe important post
of back ﬁeld coach for the Panth-
ers of 1951. I

The departure of Jack Roche,
last year’s Blue—and-Gold back
ﬁeld coach to the University of
Oregon, left the door open for
Jones, who immediately applied
for the job.

This will be the first non—play—
ing season for Jones since his

' grade school days.

1938-42 Star

“Special Delivery” came to Pitt
in 1938 from Scranton_ Tech. He
played four years of college ball
at Pitt and then entered the serv-
ice where heplayed for Naval ag-
gregations for four years. .

He performed brieﬂy for the
Chicago Bears in the National
Professional League in 1945, and
then switched to the Cleveland
Browns where he was a regular
halfback for four years.

\ Last fall he played for Hamilton,
Ontario in the Canadian League.
He set a new scoring record of 108
points for the Canadian Pro
League.

His last appearance at Pitt was
in May when he sparked the Old-
Timers offense in defeat at the
hands of the Panther Varsity.

Heiferle Tutors Frosh

A ‘second Panther coach who
has yet to be tried in college
coaching circles is Ernie Heﬂferle,
freshman football tutor.

Heiferle was appointed to the
post when John Chickerneo, suc-
cessful frosh coach last fell,’ re-
signed to take over the head
coaching reins at Sharon High
School. .

Hefferle comes to Pitt from Ta-
rentum High School where he
compiled a record of 50 wins, 13
losses, and four ties.

The new Panther coach gradu-
ated from Duquesne and is past
President of the Western Penn-
sylvania Football Coaches Asso-
ciation.

TWO NIFTY TACKLES———Bil_l Gasparovic and Bob Brennen, 217-

Ligonier training camp site. Both_ are seniors and both are in
their third football year for the Panthers. Gasparovic has been
a regular tackle the past two years, while Brennen, as a sopho-
more, was a blocking back. Brennan claims- that this year’s

everyone by getting the approving

With very little experience, he
has amazed the coaching staff with
his aggressiveness and know-how.
His only previous playing days
were with the Paciﬁc Sub-Fleet

as a submariner shortly after the
last War. ‘

The largest player on the squad,
Elder tips the scales at a solid 220
pounds, stands 6’2” and is excep-
tionally fast for his size.

He hails from Clear Lake, Minn.,
and is typical of our neighbors
from that section, being big, blond,
blue-eyed and good—natured. His
mild, congenial and cooperative
manner even after a hard scrim-
mage marks him as a person you
can’t help but like.

   Panthers Prep for Duke, .
Play Rutgers at Ligonier ’

. By BORIS WEINSTEIN _ .
LIGONIER, PA.—Conditioning and determination to pro-’ ‘
duce a winning football team at Pitt have occupied all of
Coach Tom Hami1ton’s days and nights since the squad
checked in at the. Ligonier training site. ‘ 
The ﬁrst item—-<:onditioning——has taken up most of the
player’s time, too, as Hamilton sends his charges through

 

Already.the Panthers’ 62-man
squad has swallowed ﬁve heavy
scrimmages with plans ‘calling for
at least two more to follow be-

fore the Blue-and-Gold pack up
for home Saturday, Sept: 22.
Two Exhibitions Carded
On the ﬁnal day of camp Rut-
gers University, coached by Har-
vey Harman, Pitt alumnus comes
here for a scrimmage session.
Pitt also faces Lehigh Univer-
sity at Bethlehem Saturday, Sept.
15, and puts on a dress re-
hearsal for the Alumni Day gath-
ering Wednesday, September 19.

Lehigh uses the same offensive
style that Duke employs—the'split
T formation. The Panthers’ meet
‘Duke on Sept. 29 at the Stadium.

The second factor——determina—
tion-—has also been an important
Hamiltonian feature. The “in-
terim” coach feels that with the
conﬁdence and spirit that his
squad has shown so far the desire
to win will return again. “These
boys,” Hamilton boasted, “have
the conﬁdence and potentials that
make, winners.”

_ * Injuries Hurt‘ .

For two of the boys, though, the
chances of an active grid season
are slim. Joe" Schmitt, 205—pound
junior guard from Brentwood, and
Joe Capp, 195-pound fullback
from Newton Falls, Ohio, were
ﬁrst week casualties. Both boys

pected to see much action.

Billy Reynolds, junior half-
back, injured a hip in scrimmage
drills, but is expected to be-back
in uniform for the Alumni Day
clash.

Chess May Return

camp is the rumor that Paul Chess,
junior fullback, will receive his

DON IVIURDOCK 6

By
Sports Editor

When Len Casanova decid-

ed to terminate his short stay

‘in eastern coaching circles

this summer he left the door

open for another football re-
gime to begin at Pitt.

Athletic Director Tom Ham-
flton was immediately put on the
spot. Who to get and in a hurry
was Hamil.ton’s problem. His

,dream of having Casanova lead
the Panthers back into the spot-
light had become a fantasy. Hence
the hard-working athletic direc-
tor had to think and think fast or
else the wolves would be at his
heels.

A few candidates were screened
with Lowell “Red” Dawson, back-
ﬁeld coach at Michigan State ap-
pearing to have the inside track,
when Hamilton startled the sports
world with the announcement
that he would take up the coach-
ing reins for one year. ’

Jones Replaces Roche

His ﬁrst move in his new ca-
pacity was an all-important one.
He appointed Edgar Jones, former
Panther star, to the post of back-
ﬁeld coach replacing Jack Roche,
who left with Casanova for a sim-
ilar positior. at Oregon Univer-
sity.

If Hamilton carries out his plan
of a one year coaching stint and
Jones excels as ‘a coach what is

there to prevent the former Pitt
passer from casting his ballot for
the head coaching reins?

Recent reports from the
Ligonier football training’ site tell
us that Bobby Bestwick has im-
proved immensely over last year’s
performances.
