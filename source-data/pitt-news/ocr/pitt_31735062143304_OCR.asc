Steady practice since early l\'Iarc_h,§
and months spent in preparation of?
the book and musical numbers were
ended for Cap and Gown men last
zuight when they presented their iirst
performaiice of “All to the Point" be-
fore the Shrine at the Syria Temple.

Another show will be given at the
Mosque‘ this‘ evening, again before
the private Shrine audience. Monday
night the musicale moves into the
Nixon Theater for an entire week’s
engagement, wi_th the Monday per-
formance "sponsored by the Allegheny
County Civic Club.

Seventy-ﬁve men take part in the
cast and the chorus work of the
show, the greatest number in recent
years. ~ Twenty-ﬁve ‘more "are in‘clud-
-ed in the business and the production
staffs.‘ William Marlatt, who has
taken charge of the production for
four years, is directing the revue.

"All to the Poiut” is billed as a
romance of early Pittsburgh. The
University is two years old at the
time oftheaction, and ﬁgures as the
Pittsburgh Academy, Judge Bracken-
ridge’s school. The hero, Craig
Forbes, ﬁnds himself a wife before
the end of the evening, but_the.love
plot with Miss‘ Melissa Marbury is
often interrupted by musical and hu-
morous numbers.

John ‘Wyeth, one of the comedy
hits of the 1932 “Silver Domino,” per-
forms in ‘a reputed laugh riot, “I once
was Braddock’s pet. but there’s still
life in the old girl yet.” As Mrs.
Pride, who conducts a girls’ school,
Wyeth teacl1es'the young ladies to
knit, sew, and be good housewives.
But that isn’t all. They learn to-

but that's why they're selling
tickets! '
Raspberry Time, a collection of

"merry villagers,” satirizes the ferry
boat service, and the other public
utilities in the Pittsburgh of 1789.
The croquet champion of the town
also enters in, but just how has not
yet been revealed. '

Joseph Tormey and Bernard Rosen-
son perform a colonial adaptation of
Gallagher and Sheen as they do a
typical song of the revolutionary
days. Allan Divers, Robert Haase,
Marshall Baker, and Richard 0111 pro-
vide the accompaniment as all sing,
“Join the Army,” a revival of the
spirit of ’76.

Robert Connolly, as Miss Melissa
Marbury, the demure heroine, and
lugene Kelly in a dance specialty,
feature in a novelty number, “Old
King Cole,’’ and James Hubbard, the
Gandhi of last year's show, ap-
pears on the stage minus his goat as
he sings’ with" Baker and Haase,
“What Love Means to Me." Famous
lovers of history, including, yes. Cas-
anova. are raked over the coals in

$300,000 will be made on the new cen-
tral heating system for ﬁve local in-
stitutions, including the Cathedral of

pleted the cost may approach $700,000,

ing system called ‘for the use of the
present heating plant of the Carnegie
Library with renovations, improve-
ments and enlargements in the shape

' Stammelbach’

The p_1'o,testing'

abroad.

Thirty-four students had ﬁled peti-
tions for the ﬁfteen elective posit-ions
when the original period closed at '5
o'clock Wednesday afternoon. A
check-up of all candidates conducted
by the‘ Pitt News Wednesday‘ night
revealed that two nominees fo‘r‘ju-
nior Council posts, Charles Hartwig,
Ed. ’34, and Arnold Suba, Mines “'34.
were both ineligible for‘ election ‘al-
though their‘ petitions ‘ had‘ been certi-
ﬁed by Elections Chairman‘ ‘Albert
through the oﬂice‘ of
the dean of men. ' ‘ ‘ ' ‘  “

Hartwig, the sole petitionee for the
junior Education ‘position in Council,
and ‘Suba, who‘ was ‘opposed by only

one man from the School ‘of Mines

yesterday before Stammelbach ‘acted
to re-‘open “the petitioning period, were
both found to be s_econd'seme‘ster ju-
niors. The constitution of Student
Council provides‘ that junior ‘repre-
sentatives sliall beelected i_n'the ‘sec-
ond semester of their ‘sophomore
year. B‘oth'candidates were declared
ineligible by‘ Stax'm_nel'bach after
deans in the two schools had con-
ﬁrmed their present rating as juniors.
” Stammelébach, who yesterday morn-
ing extended the petioning time until
Monday at 2:30 o’clock, was over-
ruled by President Reed Rose, Dent.
’33, later in the day and the dead-
line placed at 5 o’clock this after-
noon. A provision in the governors’
constitution states that all petitions
must be returned not later than a.
week before the day of election. This
was given as the reason for the
change. It would have been neces-
sary to postpone the election to a
later (late under the Stammelbach
ruling, thus abroga.ting another con-
stitutional provision which states
clearly that Spring elections must be
held before May 1.

when a prominent’ member of one of
these houses adrnigtted the inference
of a coalition “slate” and the fact
that he had attended meetings with
representatives of the other fraterni-

A survey of the list of candidates

The fact that there was no “over-

Forced by an overflow ‘crowd .to

speak on “A Defense of the Movies”

More than one hundred students

of the modern motion picture.
industry is this year celebrating only
its thirty-ninth anniversary,” Cohen
said. “It is thus only a new business,
subject to many mistakes."

“The average picture now costs
about $200,000. it is a tremendous
undertaking which consumes much
time and efl‘or’_t.- All in all, the movies
have a greater percentage of ‘good’
productions than has the stage, which
average only one 'hit’_' in seven open-
ings,” the speaker declared.

Attacking the" idea‘ ‘of individual
state censorship, as “silly and use-
less,” the Post-Gazette writer crit-
icized political boards which pass on
the morality of pictures. “Too often,
he asserted, “politics and not ability
determine the choice of state censors."

 

 

Extension, Bureau
Aids High Schools

Belfour Helps Administer Foren-
sic Music League for Schools.

   

Pitt's extension division, believes C.
Stanton Belfour, assistant director of
the division, renders Pennsylvania
high schools a. valuable service by ad-
ministering the work of the Penn-
sylania Forensic and Music League.
The league, which includes a majority
of the state's high schools, has fos-
tered for the last six years contests
in speech and instrumental, choral
and vocal music.

The league program is planned to
supplement athletic activities in the
high school extra-curricular schedule.
A_complicated structure of events,
which begins in contests among small
county sections, ﬁnally evolves into
the state ﬁnals where the cream of
the contestants meet in forensic and
music events.

It is essentially not a struggle for
prizes. Small cups are awarded the

finalists, but these must be won three
times for permanent possession. The
only material rewards are scholar-
ships to the Eastern Music Camp,
these scholarships being given only
to really
sicians.

Debate topics are in line with the
spirit of the times. The one chosen
for this year is: Resolved, That at
Least One-half of All State and Local
Revenues Should be Derived From
Sources Other Than Tangible Prop-
erty_

Music contestants must be familiar
with various compositions. They sing
or play» one compulsorynumber. and
one optional, the-~-latter chosen from

State ﬁnals this year will be held
in Sunbury, in the central part of
the state: the other ﬁve contests were
held respectively in Pit,tsbn_i;gh,,,,Har-
risburg, Phlladelpl1'ia,’Altoona, and

Inquiry Hears lPhysics Students Answer
Questionnaire On Courses,

The physics department's policy of
giving the students a voice in the
conduct of the course has been ac-
complished through the use of a ques-
-tionn'a‘ire.'. .'l‘he‘;queSti0ns are planned"
by Dr. Blackwood and other members
of the physics faculty and are given
once each year.

The following results show some
of the interesting facts revealed by
these questionnaires in the past years.

In comparison with other courses of
the University, thirty-one found
physics highly interesting, sixty-four
fairly interesting and only twelve un-
interesting.  The‘ demonstration lec-
tures rated high, with eighty—eight
ﬁnding them helpful to some degree
in understanding the course and
seventeen saying thumbs down on
demonstration lectures. The students
were unanimous in their approval of

recitation as an aid in the course.
-Only seven students thought the prob-
lem section worthless; the laboratory
work found eighty-seven adherents
and twelve. opponents. Seventeen
“students claimed the instructors in-
capable of coping with their individ-
ual problems while eighty-ﬁve offered
a refutation of this claim.

Despite the acknowledged tough-
ness of the courses. ﬁve students
claimed one hour a week suﬂicient
time for -study. - The supposed norm
for the course is eight hours a week.
Twenty students gave the subject
from two to three hours’ attention,
but‘tl1i1-ty-four others rated‘ physics
four to ﬁve hours a week. Twenty-
seven students came close to the
norm giving six to seven hours of
their week to the course, while only
fourteen students studied it from
eight to ten hours a week.

Olsen Holds Little Hope For
Panthers to Win First
Meet, Tomorsow

 

 

Go to Philadelphia Today

 

After a t\\'0~da.y period of trials and
eliminations. 2 picked tracksters
leave this morning for Philadelphia
to make their‘ 1933 .debut against
Temple tomorrow aiiternoon.

After conipariiig reading notices ap-
pearing in the
with times and distances made by
his men this week, Coach Carl Olsen
boarded the bus for the Quaker City
this morning in a. very pessimistic

mod, holding out little chance for
the Blue and Gold to win its initial
meet. .

Except in the dashes and long runs
the Panther ti'ack.nien will face a
well balanced combination in Temple.
As a quarter mller, Engler has been
clocked during the spring training
season under :49. In t.lie hall‘ mile
Davis has been timed at 1:57.
Against --l.'heS9'”‘llllleS ' Olsen -1 will "send-'
Keller. Vvatkins, McDonald, Kiger,
and Clise to compete.

Llewellyn Parlette will provide Ol-
sen's proteges plenty of trouble to-
morrow a.i’t.e-rnoon. A four ezvent man,
he has lieaved the 16-pound shot over
45 feet. threw the discuss consistent-
ly at 135 feet, and holds a 186-feet
record in the javelin event. He is
also entered in the half mile event for
Temple. In these events Olsen will
depend on Gongloit, Bonavita. Self-
fert. Blake, Rocker, and Valenti to
score points for the Blue and Gold.

ln the broad jump Temple will have
Paul, who has jumped in his spring
trials over 22 feet, to compete against;
Fleming. Theissen, and Sebastian.
Lipscliutz, Read, and Monte will pro-
vide opposition for Crocker, Ericcson,
O'Dell in the pole vault; Sims, Nel-
son. and Tlieissen in the high jump.

Pitt's strength will lie in the short
dashes, with Sclilossberg, Jacobson,
and Fleniing; entered in the 100: to
which combination McDonald will be
added in the 220-yard event. In the
mile event, Wagenhouse, KlI'l(D8tI‘iCl(,
and (‘lise will carry the Blue and
Gold colors; in the two-mile event
Pitt will be represented by Albright,
Lawrence, and Kerr.

for Philadelphia includes:

I5 Events Comprise Program

For All-Student Aiiair;
Handicap Varsity

Meet Wednesday at 3:30

 

A second track and ﬁeld meet for
students will be conducted under the
auspices of the athletic department
iiext week, with entries now being re-

ceived for the meet being planned for 1

Wednestlay afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
Blue, red and white ribbons will be
awarded to all first, second, third
place winners.

“It will be a miracle if any varsity
lra.ckman should win any event,” was
Coach Olsen's comment on the first
annual handicap track meet to be
conducted in the Stadium and prac-
tice ﬁeld. “This meet, as the one we

conducted last fall,” said Coach 01-,

sen, “will be strictly a. meet for any
student in the University having a
desire to participate in a. track meet.
No track experience is necessary.
Any one with experience on a track
team will .be"lI1lIll'ef}l21l;8l~y handicap-
ped.”

Entries now open for the iirst
novice spring track meet, will close
Tuesday afternoon at 5 o’clock. Fit‘-
teen events will be run-oli‘ during the
program. from the 100 to the two-mile
run, high and low hurdles, shot put,
hammer throw, javelin, and pole
vault.

As an added attraction. for the aft-
ernoon, graduate manager 01? ath-
letics, James Hagan, has designated
the afternoon as a homecoming for
lfornier track stars of the University.
It is e-xpected that more than 15 old-
time runners and ﬁeld men will ap-
pear on the field to act as hoiiora.r_v
judges, timers, and checkers during
the held and track ﬁesta. A special
event is now being planned for the

lold timers to “strut their stuff” some
;time during the afternoon.

3 The first novice track and field
lmeet, held last October under the
!auspices of the athletic department
idrew more than 70 entries of stu-
gdents over the campus. Although less
{than a week remains for the spring
l meet, there. is a feeling that the entry
.;list will be comparable to that of
ilast fall.

Pitt Bits  

The return of the inevitable hot, or
rather, warm weather caused the an-
nual call for tennis candidates. Al-
ways a popular sport at Pitt, the ten-
nis call this year drew the extraor-
dinary number of 65 candidates, in-
cluding the managers.

And rumor has'it that one of
the tennis courts in the Stadium
will "be changed to a putting green
for the golfers. This will cause
the team to take to the Trees
Gym court.

Incidentally, of the sixty-five candi-

dates for the tennis team, thirty-three

were lreslimaii, and the rest varsity

material. .
_ Congratulations are in order
for the newly appointed captains
of the Panther boxing and basket-
ball tcams. A full congratulation
to Jack Schrickcr, and I guess
l’ll have to split the other one be

, tween Charley Hughes, “Dutch”
1 Ochsenhirt, and Don McCamant.

Boxing fans who are happy as the
result of Jack Schricke1"s showing in
the recent Senior AMA boxing cham-
pionships, should pause to give a big
hand to the men who took much of
their time in handling the Panther

of the VVash—Jei't‘ boxers, and coach of
the 11S—pou.nd champ, Sammy Angott.
Second, Patsy I-Iennigan, pro battler.
who assisted Tucker in the handling
of Schrlclter.

' ‘A‘ downtown sports reporter
recently labeled one of the colic-
giate boxers as the best in the
country at the present time. Evi-
dently, thc collegians record of
knockouts influenced the reporter.
However, at the present time,
pound for pound, the ‘classiest
collegiate boxer title’ goes to
either Pete D’Allesandro, of Tom-
ple, or Bobby Goldstcin, of Vir-
ginia.

The fact that three men, instead oil
the customary one, will captain the
basketball team provides the Panther
oagers with two good points. First,
everyone is satisﬁed, and deserves to
be. Second. a lot of favorable pub-
licity should result from the action.

Running off the meet in an hour's

Too Much Administration

IFTEEN fraternities and sororities of Colby College, we learn
' from The New York Times, are seeking a reduction of the ex-
penscs" of their national organizations so that they may “continue on
ii .dcmocratic plane consistent-with the traditions of the college.”
Colby fraternities, the chapters point out in 9. resolution sent to
their respective national headquarters, must never be considered a.
luxury, open only to the well-to-do. Theirs is an appeal for‘ less of
the costly administrative activity of national oiﬁces," for an evalua-
tion of policies “in terms of the actual value they contribute to the
individual members of the active chapters.”
Here, as in other colleges and universi-ties, the fraternities have
realized the necessity of cutting chapter expenses so as not to keep
out the men andwomen who-are continuing their educations under

severe ﬁnancial difﬁculties. They contend that while they have been.

ﬁghting the depression locally, the national. bodies have expanded
functions with the establishment of central olﬁccs, salaried ofﬁccrs,
elaborate records, endowment funds, traveling secretaries, (:onve1_1-
tions and New York clubs. "

The Colby chapters admit the values of the individual functions,
but decry the possible danger that these may absorb a disproportion-
ate share of fraternity expenses. The resolution, in closing, recom-
mended that expansion be supplanted by a policy of evaluation and
retrenchment.

There is new hope for the future of college fraternities to be
seen in a reaction such as this. It demonstrates that some groups of

socia‘l"frate’rnitie"s are interésted in performing their true duty to the
individual as organizations for character building and personal de-
velopment, not as gloriﬁed letter-writing clubs lacking both in per-
sonnel and purpose. ' ‘

It is a challengcwhich ha._s its application on‘ our own campus
as well as elsewhere. Some University chapters are and have been
ﬁghting for their continued existence with their backs to. the wall
in the past two years. Less "national".«guidance” and acll‘nini.st1-a-

tion, costly to the ‘individual~c.ha.pter and its members, would un- '

doubtedly go far toward strenglzliciiing the fraternity System.

Law School Grade
System Changed

 

General.» Aversge ‘of.  "Per ~‘ Gent
Required for’ Passing

The new system of grading which
has been instituted in School of Law
this semester is as follows:

The minimum grade required for
passing .in every ..course is 60 - per
cent. To complete a year's work a
student is required to pass every
course, to make a general average
of 70 per cent, and to attend 80 per
cent of the lectures and re,clta.tions
in each course for the yes"._r. "

A student who fails to pass not
more than two courses given during
the year may continue with his class,
