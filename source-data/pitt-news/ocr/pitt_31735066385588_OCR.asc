UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Expectations

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Pitt President Wesley Posvar announced
Wednesday that the university is
suspending employee hiring and
replacements, marking the start of Pitt’s
first hiring freeze since 1975.

“This is an act of prudence. We don't
know what we are going to get from the
state but from informal conversations that
we’ve had with contacts in Harrisburg, it
appears that we might not get all that we
need,” said Jack Freeman, executive vice
president.

Freeman said that the president feared
that the state appropriation this summer
for Pitt would fall short of the university’s
needs. A combination of a low
appropriation with a tight cap on how
much the university can hike tuition next

Pitt forces University
Shop to close by May

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

It will be the end of an era when the University Shop, a mainstay
on Forbes Avenue for 28 years, closes its doors for good sometime

this spring.

According to Jay McKenzie, owner of the shop which sells Pitt
paraphernalia, the University Shop’s lease will not be renewed. The
University of Pittsburgh owns the property that McKenzie has been

renting since 1962.

“They sent me an eviction notice,” McKenzie said. “They gave me
90 days [to get out of the space]. They’re not renewing my lease; I

guess that’s an eviction.”

McKenzie said that Pitt's decision was “a little bit of a shock.”
McKenzie graduated from Pitt, where he was a cheerleader, in 1958.
He has been a Golden Panther supporter ever since.

“Legally, they can take [the space] away from me, but there’s got
to be some kind of moral reasoning,” he said.

McKenzie said that Pitt wants to open a store similar to his in the

term could result in a deficit of up to $12
million.

“This is only in anticipation of the
possibility that there may be a problem. It
will only last until we can be sure of what
the state will give us," Freeman said.

Pitt is the largest employer in the city of
Pittsburgh, hiring approximately 300 faculty
and 1,500 staff members each year.

Posvar stated that exceptions to the
policy wouldbe made “under extraordinary
circumstances.”

“That might relate to the opportunity to
hire a world—class scholar or the situation
where you can demonstrate that leaving
the position open will cost the university
more than hiring someone would,”
Freeman said.

Freeman said that the hiring suspension
was the most realistic way for the university
to cut back on spending.

of budget problems cause hiring freeze

“Right now we haven’t discussed any
other cutbacks, but that is always a
possibility. About 80 percent of our budget
is in people. This is the best way to adjust
right now,” he said.

English professor Philip Wion, president
of United Faculty, said that he does not
believe the suspension was the only way
to deal with the impending financial
problems.

“Many of the faculty are very upset
about this decision. Ibelieve that there are
alternative ways that the university could
have handled this. They could have taken
the money needed out of reserve funds
that they have,” Wion said.

Wion said that he was not convinced
that the suspension was justiﬁed.

“The case has not been made by the
university that the ﬁnances are so bad that
theseiactions are needed," he said.

Wion was also concerned about the
impact the new policy might have on
minority hiring.

“I am especially upset that we might
lose out on the opportunity to hire minority
and women candidates. I hope that the
university will make exceptions in that
case,” he said.

Wion is the head of the University
Senate Budget Policy Committee, and he
said that the committee was not consulted
about the decision to suspend hiring.

“I am very upset at the way the university
handled this without consulting the
University Senate or asking for ourinput,”
he said, “It also upsets me that so much
time and energy has been wasted in
recruiting and interviewing, and that might
all be meaningless now,” he said.

space. He added that Pitt gave him an offer to manage its store, but I

did not make’ an offer for his staff. He has not responded to the offer
yet. .
Charles C. Graham, of the Office of Property Management, whose
name was on the letter that informed McKenzie of Pitt's decision,
acknowledged that the university was not renewing the lease. He
added that he did not know the reason why, but Dr. John Yeager, vice
president for administration, said that it was because “the university
is mounting a signiﬁcant new licensing program” involving items
with the Pitt logo on them. .

According to Yeager, the university wants to expand its sales of
products such as Pitt sweatshirts and other items that are currently
sold at the University Shop. Pitt may also offer a mail-order catalog

Lackillof progress on new dorm construction concerns SGB

By Jenifer Crook
Asst. News Editor

Student Government Board
President Julie Shepard has
expressed concern over the lack
of progress and organization
surrounding the construction of
a new Pitt residence hall.

“It seems as if there are a lot of
people going around wondering
what’s going on [with the
dormitory]. There hasn’t been
much student input. It seriously

concerns me,” Shepard said
during the SGB meeting Thursday
night.

Shepard said her apprehensions
started earlier this year when she
attended a luncheon with other
Pitt students and several
administrators to discuss building
plans for the new dormitory,
which will be situated in North
Oakland.

“An architect came in and
showed us a lot of drawings, but
it was odd because the students

asked the architect questions and,
in my opinion, he answered them
very rudely,” she said.

Afterward, Shepard sent a letter
to Dennis Donham, interim vice
president for student affairs, listing
the concerns and questions
students voiced at the luncheon.

“I wanted to make sure their
concerns were not forgotten,”
she said. ‘

As another example of the
currentconfusion, Shepard cited
a survey of Pitt students,

conducted over the summer,
which asked for their input on
the plans. She said that when she
requested the results of the poll,
“nobody seemed to know what
happened to it.”

According to Pitt President
Wesley Posvar, the 1,000-bed
dormitory should tentatively be
completed in time for the 1992
academic year. However, in light
of the disorganization, Shepard
thinks that goal is unrealistic
because “they still have to review

everything and have to negotiate
with Falk School.” Falk School’s
playground is the proposed site
of the project, and many North
Oakland residents and parents of
children attending the school have
opposed the construction.

Shepard said that some of the
specifics for the hall are unrealistic
as well.

“They are currently planning a
cafeteria that seats 400 students,
but the dorm will house 1,000

We probably read about 200

said. “After we narrowed the field
even more, we began interviews.
This involved travel, hotel and

meal expenses, all of which the A

university paid for."

Wion said that he estimates the

“This has taken an awful lot of

eventually.

“The bookstore doesn’t have
enough room, so we have to
look for another location,” he
said. He added that the present
site of the University Shop
provides an ideal, temporary
solution to the space problem.

However, McKenzie saidhe
feels that Pitt is making a mistake
because of the traditional and
historical value of the shop. The

* walls of the University Shop are

covered with autographs of
famous Pitt personalities dating
back to 1965.

“I think they kind of looked
around and said ‘let’s do this
ourselves,” he said. “It always
looks easier on the outside, but I
think the whole thing is what the
store means to people.

McKenzie mentioned one man
who comes back every
homecoming. He told McKenzie
that he goes to two places: to The
“O” for a hot dog and to the
University Shop to buy a shirt.

“I’m getting phone calls from
all over the country,” he said.
“This is the only place on campus
that still has any tradition and that
goes back to 1962. [Pitt’s
administration] doesn't
understand that tradition.”

Another person called
McKenzie begging him not to
paint over the autographs when
he leaves because one of them
belongs to a friend who died

recently. McKenzie said he
understands, but “when we go,
the names go.”

Yeager feels that closing the
University Shop and its “tradition”
might initially cause a slight drop
in sales, but will have no effect in
the long run. “I think [closing the
store] will have a very modest
effect [on salesl," he said. “That’s
why we wanted to continue our
relationship with the current
owner. The products are fine; we
just want to expand them.”

According to Sandy .Bergad,
who has been working at the
store since right after it opened,
Pitt's decision is “like a slap in the
face. They forget all about
tradition and loyalty.

“You hear people talk about
‘the Pitt family.’ Well, it looks like
they just threw the family out the
window.”

However, McKenzie stressed
that the administration never used
the term ‘the Pitt family.’ “That
was probably our mistake. We
thought
something we weren’t.”

students. Also, because of its
location on the hill with the
fraternities and chemistry building
[located nearby], other students
will use the facility's cafeteria. So
those plans are grossly
inadequate.”

“I think that the administration,
out of common courtesy, should
let students know what’s going
on with this. And students should
ask to know what’s happening.
The chances are that most
students here now, except for
some freshmen, will never see
[the new dormitory]. But they
should still care,” she added.

Also discussed at the meeting
was the proposed university
phone—in information system,
now dubbed “Telefact.” Shepard
said that the project will hopefully

be completed by fall of this year..

She and board member Patrick
Abramowich are currently
planning an open demonstration
of the system for students and
administration “after

the

groundwork is completed."

In other SGB business:

-Hoping to eliminate long
waits for students at the Trees
Hall weight room, Abramowich,
in his report, said that he has
been keeping Contact with interim
vice president of student affairs
Dennis Donham and intramural
director Marilyn Ross regarding
the “L-plan”. First advocated by
former board member Justin

Lawhead, the plan would double A

the size of the weight room
through the removal of the wall
separating the weight room and
men’s locker room, and three
rows of lockers. Abramowich said
that the current lockers would be
replaced with smaller, safer
models.

With expansion costs estimated
at $40,000, SGB members are
considering using a portion of
the reserve fund to pay for the

project, with the university
hopefully supplying the
remainder.

“Marilyn Ross has said that the

SGB should not have to pay more
than half of the total cost,“
Abramowich said.

0 Board member Bob Batchelor
said that he is attempting to get
the current teaching—evaluation
system revamped. Batchelor said
the problem now is that professors
voluntarily submit their
evaluations into a manual that is
available for student review. He
hopes to make submission of the
evaluations mandatory, so that
students can view all negative, as

well as positive, reports on
professors.
-SGB members Katie

Malaspina and Jay Gervasoni are
working with the department of
public safety in hopes of
promoting campus safety,
including the installment of “door
hangers” that would explain to
students the procedure for
reaching campus police. They
are also planning to conduct a
study of the “helpline” that gives
direct access to campus police.

  Undergrad business school?

University President Wesley Posvar recently noted that
Pitt may start an undergraduate school of business.
a , Advocating the possibility, Posvar stated, “The largest

T leducational] demand by young people in America today

is for an undergraduate program in business.” Posvar
‘ stated that Pitt is‘ “not meeting that demand.”

The College of Arts and Sciences currently offers a dual

business major for undergraduates in which students

 choose a. liberal-arts major to accompany their business

major. Posvar also suggested increasing the emphasis on
the business courses offered through the dual major.

In a recent interview with The Pitt News Posvar stated,
“I think one of thejmost pleasing reports is that [Pitt has]
been identified as one of the public Ivy League institu-

tions.” Accordingly, shouldn’t a university of that caliber C

have an undergraduate program which is solely business
oriented? Such schools as the University of California at
Berkeley and the University of Michigan, among others,

A do.

, Pitt’s Katz Graduate School of Business has risen to top-
20 status nationally. Considering this fact, it would be very
logical for the university to have a concentrated, under-

graduate business program to betterprepare students for -

the graduate school. Students who studied four years in
a standard business major, that is, a non—dual major}
would be more knowledgeable in the business area upon
entering the ‘business graduate school. This would, in
effect, raise the quality and performance of KGSB on an
individual and national basis. It would enable the school

_ to climb higher in national rankings among such schools.

at The CAS dual business major is a good program.
Graduates from this program might be more competitive
in the job market than students graduating solely with a
, degree in business. However, for those studentswhose
future plans are geared strictly to a graduate school for
business, the dual major often takes time away from their
business-related studies. If a student is interested only in
a business major, then why should he divert his attention
toward another field? Most other fields don’t require a
dual major; why should business be the exception?

If a sound background in the liberal arts is the concern
and reason for the dual major, students could surely
compensate for it with the conventional CAS require-
ments in the pertinent areas. ,

Additionally, substituting an undergraduate business
program fashioned on a typical CAS undergraduate
model for the current dual major one might attract new
students to Pitt who otherwise may have been deterred by
the dual-major program. And better yet, why not offer
both a dual and single business major?

If there’s any city that has a need for well-schooled
business graduates, it’s Pittsburgh. An undergraduate
business school for Pitt students is a sound idea.

.’: ‘$\\\\\

William Gladstone was a four-
time British prime minister be-
tween 1868 and 1894. Gladstone,
concerned with the conscience
and morality of the then-imperi-
alist British empire, sought the
independence of the British
crown colonies. He desired to
see that the colonies be emanci-

pated from British rule so as to —
, enjoy their own national inde-

pendence, but he also voiced
caution and concern that this be
done in a guardianship type of

- manner, so as to insure that these

countries could make a success-
ful transition to independence.

‘Basically, although Gladstone I

strongly yearned for independ-
ence for these countries, he didn’t

want the actual emancipation of .

the colonies to be counterpro-

~ ductive.

We see this same type of sce-
nario today in South Africa.

Typically, defenders of the
current South African government
did not support it because they
favor or enjoy its racially dis-
criminatory apartheid policies, but
rather they fear that this rich-in—
resources and economically pro-
ductive nation could be ruined if
it fell into the hands of an incom-
petent non-apartheid leader who
wouldn’t — effectively run the
country. This has happened many
times before in other former
colonial African nations.

The African National Con- .

gress—- a very 1eft—of-center‘or—
ganization-which has also been
referred to as Marxist by many
creditable analysts — would like
to see the end of apartheid rule in
South Africa. However, the aims
of the ANC (of which the Soviet
Union has always heavily in-
vested) are not merely limited to

ending apartheid’s discriminatory
practices, but an end to! apartheid
rule altogether. If the ANC ever
takes charge of South Africa, it
may revamp the country's entire
economicsystem along Marxist
guidelines. Although? the ANC
might succeed in ending institu-

 

Paul
  Kengor

tionalized discrimination in South
Africa, it could also tear the pros-
perous nation to shreds through
its Marxist economic. agenda.
This is what sullen supporters of
the South African government
most fear.

One needs only to rehash the
situations in other African na-
tions (of which the ANC doesn’t

scrutinize as it does South Africa)

to fear what type of counterpro-
ductive future might lay ahead
for an ANC-lead South Africa.
Thirty-eight of Africa’s 45 nations
are ruled by one-man or one-
party dictatorships who practice
some form of economically de-
structive socialism. Many of the
leaders are extremely corrupt,
much more so than a Ferdinand
Marcos, for example. Among

those countries are Ethiopia’s
Marxist and despotic ruler Lt. -Col.
Mengistu Mariam, who has dis-
played the unique talents of Jo-
seph Stalin through such dandy
feats as killing nearly 1 million
Ethiopians, driving 5 million more
into exile and forcing peasants
off their lands and onto state
farms: one of the country’s Marx-
ist policies that lead to the 1984-
85 famine which killed nearly a
million people. Communism may
be ‘dead in Eastern Europe, but
it’s alive and well in A-frica.-«,
But chances are probably high
that the South African people
wouldn’t vote for a socialist type

of leader (although former ANC ‘ 

leader and founder Nelson
Mandela would probably win a
free South African election by a
landslide): they see how much
more productive their nation is
than others in Africa. But they

. could always be deceived by a

type of leader who might claim

to advocate capitalism, but in— A

stead desire its antithesis.

The trick to a successful, pro-
ductive and happy future‘ for
South Africa is to allow all of its
citizens the right to vote, but at
the same time to suppress the
inﬂuence of the ANC, who may
very well be masking a"Marxist
agenda under the face of a
humanitarian cause to end South
African racial discrimination. Last
week, however, South African
President F.W. de Klerk lifted the
nation’s 30-year ban on the ANC
as its first major step towards
ending apartheid rule; chrono-
logically, it should’ve been its
last.

Pitts graduation date ignores students’ religious needs

Faced with scheduling prob-
lerns involving the Civic Arena,
the University of Pittsburgh has
changed the date of its com-
mencement from Sunday, April
29, 1990, to Saturday, April 28,
1990. Having been presented with
a number of alternatives, admit-
tedly none of which were ideal,
the university chose what it
viewed as the best among a
number of bad options. Their
ultimate decision was to hold
graduation exercises on a Satur-
day, thus preventing Jewish stu-
dents who observe the Sabbath
from participating.

The ﬁnal decision by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh to change
the date of _ graduation to a Satur-
day is not only a defeat forjewish
students at Pitt, but also a defeat
for every student who feels that
the university should be truly
open, in all facets, to each stu-

It's impossible to be normal in a world full of loonies 

There are plenty of ways to get
out of trouble if you find yourself
caught up in a mess. First, try
citing the Fifth Amendment, and
if that doesn’t work, you can
always plead temporary insanity.

The latter, which works about
99 percent of the time, always
cracks me up. The way I see it,
everybodyis insane at least some
time in life, if not most of the
time.

You may be thinking, “What’s
wrong with this chick? She’s call-
inst me insane — is she nuts?” Of
course I am. I’m what you might
call wacko, loony tunes or zany.
What do you expect after three
years at Pitt?

Of course, to anyone who‘

knows me, this comes as no
surprise. What may surprise you
is the fact that everyone, even

dent, regardless of religious affili-
ation. -

We live in symbols. Every ac-
tion that is taken and every deci-
sion that is rendered comes for-
ward as a statement of our ideals.
In its_decision, the university has
made a statement of exclusion
based on the same cultural diver-
sity it claims to celebrate. The
symbolic ramifications of its
decision are even more troubling
than the specific issue itself.
Graduation may be the topic, but
the theme of the controversy is
openness.

The University of Pittsburgh is
lacking when it comes to accom-
modating the religious needs of
its students. Though I strongly
support a strict separation be-
tween church and state, the uni-
versity goes beyond this, making
the free exercise of religion diffi-
cult for many of its students. This

moments when they were on the
verge of losing every last marble
that rolls around in their head.
If you don’t believe me, look
around. Take note of the multi-
tudes of students going to and
from classes —-they have to be
crazy to pay big bucks for their
“education.” Examine the people
‘who go around with cheesy
smiles on their faces — do you
really think that they’re happy
because life is so grand? Even the
people who loole normal have at
least a little Norman Bates blood
pulsing through their veins.
Believe me, I know. I’ve been
studying this subject for years.
Observation is the key, baby. If
you look long enough, you de-
velop a sixth sense for these
things — the nutso feelers. I can

State legislature needs

Now and again you read about
a bizarre incident of censorship.
In 1986, a group of Tennessee
fundamentalists, led by the spe-
cial interest group Concerned
Women for America, filed a law-

suit to remove a copy of the

movie The Wizard of Oz from a
Hawkins County school. That
same year, the Parents Music
Resource Center, a group of
Washington wives led by Tipper
Gore, fought to censor rock music.
Before Congress the PMRC
warned America of the “harmful”
and “dangerous” effects of “evil”
rock music. Their lament echoed
the anti-rock music hysteria 25
years ago when Elvis Presley
swayed his hips and the Beatles
sang “She Loves You.” Appar-
ently every generation faces this
hysteria. In the ’20s, the Char-
leston and ﬂappers caused con-
troversy. In the ’40s, Frank Sinatra
rufﬂed parents’ prudish feathers.
And currently in Pennsylvania,

our state legislature is in an up-
roar over warning labels.

In December, State Represen-
tative Ronald Gamble (D-
Oakdale), attached an amend-
ment to bill SB 938. It would

require store owners to label.

“dangerous” records. The amend-
ment passed in the House 149 to
54. If it passes in the Senate and
Governor Casey signs it, a 4" X 6"
warning label must be placed on
records, cassettes and compact
discs deemed “dangerous.” The
warning label reads: PARENTAL
WARNING. MAY CONTAIN
MORBID VIOLENCE, DRUG OR
ALCOHOL USE, SADOMASO-
CHISM, DEVIATE SEXUAL IN-
TERCOURSE and a list of other
“nasties.” If a record-store owner
sells a “dangerous” record with-
out

the label, he or she faces a $100
fine. This may seem harmless;
however, Gamble’s sneaky at-
tempt to censor American music

applies as much to Christians as
it does to Jews (one needs only
to be reminded of finals sched-
uled on Good Friday!).

Pitt wants to claim equal status
among the great universities of
our nation. And yet, all of these
great universities respect the
religious convictions of their
students and avoid holding
graduation exercises on days
which conﬂict with the religious
obligations of its students.

university. This seems to me a
great error on the part of his ad-

ties, the president has limited
weekly office hours to meet with
interested students. But our presi-
dent, even over an issue as con-
troversial as this one, refused to
meet with us. This should be
quite troubling to us all.

An additional issue which has
come out of this debate is the
students’ lack of power over
administrative decisions. Even the
backing of the Student Govern-
ment Board seemed to mean little
to the administration when it came
down to its ultimate decision.

a warning against Warning labels

needs to be exposed. '
Consider the consequences the
bill would have: First, the store
owner must label the “danger-
ous” records. A store owner
would have to listen to every
record and determine if the rec-
ord violates one of the set crite-

Mark

Smith  

ria. Store owners do not have the
time or the staff to monitor every
record; they might go broke. In
order to avoid criminal prosecu-
tion, a store owner may not carry
certain records unless they are
labeled (e.g. Madonna, heavy-
metal music, rap, etc.). Gamble
would succeed in censoring
music. Even more ridiculous,

Gamble’s wording in the amend-
ment is vague. I
For example, no rule of thumb
will be established under the
amendment’s guidelines. One
retailer may not find objection-
able what another retailer labels
objectionable. The wording does
not create a unified standard,
and the bill would be challenged
legally.

Even more puzzling, following
Gamble’s own wording, music
from the 1920s, '30s and ’40s,
which mentions alcohol, must

be labeled harmful. Millions of

Americans listened to this music,
including the state legislature.
Does the state legislature want to
ban the Andrews Sisters’ “Rum
and Coca-Cola” or Dean Martin's
“Little Ole Wine Drinker Me?”
Opera mentions violence; Bibli-
cal recordings mention alcohol
and violence. Will these be la-
beled “dangerous?” In all these

instances, SB 938 will require
them to have a warning label.
But the bottomline here is: Will
warning labels have an effect?

Warning labels may actually

increase record sales if retailers
_ can afford to place them on rec-
ords. Simply saying “no” will
only increase the chances that
people will want to listen to the
music in question. It appears
that Gamble didn’t consider this
possibility, but I am not not sur-
prised. Before the state legisla-

ture his “scientific evidence” to

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Easy Pickins ’...Pantbers wallop Villanova 94-82

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

Villanova’s Wildcats came to
Pitt Saturday night and set a Big
East record with 1 5 three-pointers.
But they went home with a 94-82
loss.

Their potent outside shooting
was not enough to stop Pitt’s
balanced attack, which boasted
six players in double ﬁgures in
front of a sellout crowd of 6,798
at Fitzgerald Field House.

“I was happy with all of them
[Pitt players]. They all played very
well,” said Pitt Coach Paul Evans.

Darren Morningstar set the
tone early by scoring Pitt’s first
four points on layups. He finished
with a season-high 10 points by
shooting a perfect 5 for S from
the ﬂoor. Morningstar gave credit
to the passing of Darelle Porter.
“Darelle’s a great point guard. He
really finds the people on the
ﬂoor real well,” Morningstar said.

Morningstar’s quick four points
prompted Villanova Coach Rollie
Massimino to put 7—foot-3 center
Tom Greis into the game. Greis
led Villanova with 24 points; 18
in the first half.

Knowing that Villanova has its
greatest success when it plays a
defensive tempo, Pitt wanted to
get into a high-scoring running
game. Porter, who ﬁnished with
21 points and six assists, enjoyed

the wide-open game. “It was fun
because I got the ball in transition
a lot and got to create some
things,” Porter said.

“I just took it to the hoop
aggressively. Some good things
came of it,” he added.

Pitt’s first three—pointer didn’t
come until 10 minutes into the
first half when Jason Matthews
sank one off a pass from Brian
Shorter. Matthews connected
twice from three-point land en
route to a 13-point game total.
Pitt only attempted eight three-
pointers, scoring on three of them.
Sixth man Rod Brookin made
one and also ﬁnished with 15
points.

The see—saw first half saw Pitt
leading by as many as six points
and trailing by as many as four.
With time running out in the half
and the Panthers trailing by one,
they looked to Porter to provide
the momentum going into the
locker room. Porter was going to
pass to Matthews, but the zone
defense permitted him to
penetrate for an inside shot to
give Pitt the 38-37 halftime lead.

In the second half the Panthers
knew they would have to stop
the inside scoring of Greis and
consequently changed their
defensive scheme. This led to
Chris Walker and Greg Woodard’s
three-point barrage. All 15 shots
attempted by Walker were from

three"-point land. He connected
on seven of them to finish with
21.

“He did a great job shooting
that well on an away court,” said

Porter. Woodard was six for eight
on three-pointers and wound up
with 20 for the game.

 M0rm'ngstar rises to occasion against R0llz'e’s Wildcats

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

If an opponent’s. high shooting
percentage is what depresses Villanova
head coach Rollie Massimino, then Darren
Morningstar could have sent him straight
to Western Psychiatric Institute for
observation and a prescription for lithium.

Morningstar shot a perfect 100 percent
from the ﬁeld, connecting on ﬁve shots,
including the first four points of the
game.

After the contest, a dejected Massimino
stated that Pitt was able to post the best
shooting percentage against his team all
year (60.7).

He became even more dejected as he
described how his team held every
previous opponent except one to under

50 percent from the ﬂoor.

Aside from his perfect shooting
exhibition, Morningstar played a key
role in shutting down ,‘Nova’s 7— foot—3-
inch center Tom Greis in the second half.

After an impressive 18—point first half,
Greis was held to a mere six points in the
second half. And Morningstar contributed
to a good portion of Greis’ ineffectiveness
in the second half during the ‘10 minutes
he played.

“All I tried to do was keep a body on
[Greis]. We were in a triangle in two, and
I was playing the seam in the middle of
the zone. It’s hard to prevent him from
scoring because he’s so tall. But when I
was down where I was supposed to be,
I just kept a lot of muscle on him. I don’t
think he’s that much stronger, he’s just so
tall,” Morningstar said.

Pitt’s smaller forward Brian Shorter
was quick to assert how beneficial
Morningstar’s size is when playing a
team with a center as tall as Greis.

“Morningstar helps a lot because he’s
6’.10", 240 [pounds]. And with Greis in
there who’s 7’3"—, it gives him a chance to
give Greis a hard time with the turn-
around jumper,” Shorter said.

“Greis could have done more [without
Morningstar covering] because he’s got
such a height advantage on the rest of
us.”

Morningstar’s presence in the middle
also opens up scoring opportunities for
Shorter, who is usually double or triple
teamed.

“Morningstar takes up a lot of space in
there and it gives me a chance to move
around and do other things,” Shorter

said. 1

Indeed. After scoring only seven points
in the ﬁrst half, a pace far off from his Big
East leading 21.2 ppg average, Shorter
was able to explode for 17 in the second
half to boost his average to 22.5 ppg.

The fact that Morningstar was even
able to. stay in this game was a feat in
itself. He averages a personal foul every
four minutes and has fouled out of three
games while playing the fewest minutes
of any starter on the team. .

Morningstar has mixed it up with
some of the best in the conference,
including Alonzo Mourning of
Georgetown and Jayson Williams of St.
John’s because of his extremely physical
style of play. Another potential
confrontation with Greis loomed close

Spindler foregoes last year at Pitt to enter NFL draft

By Jeffrey Shurilla
For The Pitt News

Pitt football star Marc Spindler
announced on Saturday that he
will pass up his ﬁnal year of
eligibility and enter the NFL draft.

“Basically, I spent three years
at the University of Pittsburgh,”
said Spindler. “The main reason
I came here,’ Coaches [Frankl
D’Alonzo and [Mikel Gottfried,
are no longer with me. I had a
great three years here. I talked to
my father [Saturday] and he feels
the best decision for me to make

is to forego my final year of
eligibility and enter the National
Football League draft.”

The announcement came just
one day after Spindler denied
reports that he was even close to
making a decision.

Spindler, a 6—foot-S-inch, 290-
pound defensive tackle from
Scranton,‘ Pa., was one of the
most sought—after players in the
country coming out of high
school. He was the 1986 USA
Today Defensive Player of the
Year and after a lot of
consideration, feels that he is

making the best decision.

“I proved everything I had to
prove here for three years, and
the only thing left to do is to
move on.” New head
coach Paul Hackett is sorry that
Spindler will be leaving the
university, but had nothing but
praise for what S pindler did while
at Pitt.

“If there was one thing Marc
S pindler brought to the University
of Pittsburgh, it was effort and
hard work,” said Hackett. “I
think he was a great model and a
great inspiration in terms of his

work ethic on the football field.
Obviously I’m disappointed he
won’t be with us in the fall.”

In his first season at Pitt, S pindler
was second on the team in tackles,
as he became only the fourth

true freshman in 20 years to start

in his ﬁrst game. In his sophomore
year, he played in only ﬁve
games, due to season-ending
surgery to repair knee ligament
damage.

This past season, Spindler led
the team in tackles despite missing
the second half against Penn
State and not playing against

Rutgers in the regular season
finale.

Spindler has been given a clean
bill of health and he feels that he
will make an NFL club happy.
After talking to his dad, he also
hopes that he can make his family
happy.

“[Spind1er’s father] said, ‘You’ve
got nothing else left to prove.

Financially you can help us.’ And‘

that's one thing I wanted to do

my whole life, is to help my

father,” said Spindler. “He helped

me for 20 years of my life.

Rowing club ﬁnishes second in Weekend tourney ,

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

The Pitt Rowing Club placed
second behind Carnegie Mellon
University (13 points) at Chatham
College with a score of 11 points
without even putting their boats
in the water this weekend .

The Panthers were one of seven
universities, three high schools
and three local rowing
associations to compete in the
Fourth Annual Pittsburgh Indoor
Rowing Championships.

“We finished pretty strong. I
think we deﬁnitely gave a better
performance than CM U did. They
had a couple [of] lucky breaks,”
said Pitt’s Bob Falk. “If you
compare how our talent matched
up with their talent, we prove to
be a better team. They just
happened to win the points on us
today.

“And I think that's going to
show when we come down to
the water. We show how much
more dominant we are in the

boat than on these Iergometersl,”
said Falk.

Competing this year were
Allegheny River Rowing Club,
Chatham College, CMU,
Duquesne University, Ellis High
School, Fox Chapel High School,
Mercyherst College, North
Allegheny High School, Pitt, Three
River Rowing Association,
University of Pennsylvania and
Vista Health Services.

The PIRC is a satellite of the
Charles River All—Star Sculling
Has-Bejen held in Boston on Feb.
19. '

The CRASH Bs originated in
the New England area. “A bunch
of guys from Yale and Harvard
had really not much to do after
they had finished their rowing on
the water, so what they did was
they came up with a machine [to
row out "of the water]. The first
machine was a bicycle wheel and
gear setup,” said Charles Bonavita,
the director of rowing for the
ARC.

The machines used this past

weekend are called Ergometers
and are priced at around $600
each. The Ergometer looks similar
to a stretched—out version of a
spinning wheel, with a seat that
slides along a track.

Any competitor who can pull a
7:56 or better for the 2,500 meter
qualifies for the CRASH Bs and
will be given a round— trip plane
ticket to the CRASH Bs to
compete.

“If your time qualiﬁes you, [you]
will be sent a ticket to get you to
the CRASH Bs. Four people per
event will receive tickets," said
Bonavita.

The events covered in both the
CRASH B5 and the PIRC are: 1.
Men’s Junior (18 years old and
under); 2. Women’s Junior (18
years old and under); 3. Men’s
Lightweight (165 pounds or less);

-4. Women’s Lightweight (135

pounds or less); 5. Coxins
competition (Coxins only); 6.
Men’s Open (no restrictions); 7.
Women’s Open (no restrictions);
8. Men’s Master (ages 30-39); 9.

10. Men’s Senior (ages 40-49); 11.
Women’s Senior (40-49); 12.
Men’s Veteran (ages 50 and up);
and 13. Women’s Veteran (ages
50 and up).

For most of the competitors,
this was the first time they had
actually competed in an
ergometer race.

Going into her first ergometer
meet, Luanne Rosa, who has been
rowing for Pitt for the past two
years, said that she really wasn’t
nervous going into this
competition.

“Right now I'm calm. I haven’t
sat on the seat yet,” Rosa said.

The Panthers placed third in
the women's lightweight division
with Trish Cloonan’s time of
10:54.5, while the TRRA placed
first with a time of 10:22.9 and
CMU’s Abigail Ochberg placed
second with a time of 10:44.3.

well as some of the other girls’

Swim team drowns t/ye Bonnies

By Jim Lakely
Staff Writer

As expected, the women's
swimming and diving team came
away with an easy 173-96 victory
over St. Bonaventure at Trees
Pool on Saturday.

Swimming against a team like
St. Bonnie gave Coach David
Belowich a chance to try some
swimmers in different events to
better prepare for the
championship season in the
weeks ahead.

There were some new names
in the 200 medley relay, but with
a team as deep as the Lady
Panthers, it is definitely not a step
down. Janine Atiyeh, Debbie
Bardzil, Noelle Barry and Clare
McShane finished second. This
event created momentum for the
swimmers involved and set them
up well for a‘ good meet.

In the event usually dominated
by Theresa Picklo, Celeste Makiel
made a surprise appearance in
the 1,000 freestyle and came out
a winner. Julie Levri finished
second.

The 100 backstroke had two
pleasant surprises. After a strong
showing in the 200 medley relay,
Atiyeh won a very close race on
a reach for the wall. In third place
was Makiel, just two events after
her victory in the tough 1,000

_ freestyle.

A new name in the 100

~ breaststroke, Debbie Bardzil came

in second. Suzi McManus started
off her fine meet performance
with a third-place finish.

pm finished 1-2 in the ‘Q00
butterfly and Jill Comeau posted
her first victory in the event. Kara
Moxie came in second.

In the 200 freestyle, Crit
Gallagher won and Jen Sari
finished third.

Trina Thames won the 50 free,
“an event that is kind of new for
her,” said Belowich. He was
happy with the way the event
unfolded as Terri Zeigler and
Kirstie Beltz ﬁnished second and
third, respectively.

One aspect of the Lady Panthers
that has been consistently strong
all year is the diving team. In the
1-meter event Donna Flach
finished first, Melinda Hennon
came in second and Sasha Miller
placed third. Hennon won the 3-
meter board competition and
Diane Chmieliwski finished
second. They both have dived
well enough for the Eastern and
NCAA pre-qualifying meets to be
held later this month.

Atiyeh became a double winner
with her victory in the 200
backstroke. Belowich feels her.
strong performance in the last
few meets sets her up well for the
Big East Championships.

Suzi McManus took two
seconds off her best time in
winning the 200 breaststroke.
Mary Caspero finished second
andJulie Rocks, usually a butterﬂy

swimmer, placed third.

McManus took four seconds
off her best in the 400 individual
medley. The freshman’s strong
finish this year gives hope to
Coach Belowich, making her
future at Pitt look very bright.
Comeau also swam an unusual
event in the 400 IM and posted
her best time ever in a second-
place finish. McManus was a walk-
on this year and her improvement
is a very pleasant surprise for the
team. “I’m very excited about
next year,” she said. “David is an
excellent coach.”

Belowich and his coaching staff
have been looking for a third
event for captain Sandy Albright
to compete in, and they found it
on Saturday. In only the second
time she has competed in the
event, Albright won the 100
butterﬂy. Bothered with tender
shoulders, the backstroke
swimmer likes her new event.
Noelle Barry finished second.

Coupled with her victory in the
400 medley relay, McShane
became a double winner in the
500 freestyle. Liz Sari finished
second.

“[The victory] was a nice ending
to a dual-meet season. “This sets
us up well for the Big East
Championships,” said Coach
Belowich.

Pitt will begin the defense of
their Big East Championship
starting this Thursday at Trees

game. “That's the best shooting
percentage against us all year,”
said Massirnino.

Morningstar brought the
crowd to its feet early in the
second half on an alley-oop
layup off a pass from Porter.

“That felt real good. I’m not
too much of a leaper. When
Darelle threw it, I was kind of
happy," said Morningstar.

Pitt led by as many as 14
points and trailed only once in
the second half. Shorter led all
Pitt scorers with 24 points, hitting
nine of 19 from the floor and six
of eight from the foul line.
Shorter enjoyed the upbeat
tempo of the game. “Everytime
we got the opportunity, we
tried to run. We knew Villanova
“doesn't,” said Shorter.

Bobby Martin rounded out
the six Panthers who scored in
double figures by shooting six
of eight from the ﬂoor and one
for four from the foul line,
winding up with 13 points.

Brookin and Shorter sealed
the victory with back—to-back
dunks with about two minutes
remaining. Shorter’s two-
handed slam gave the Panthers

a 12-point lead.

The Panthers are now 8-10
overall and 3-5 in the Big East.
This Wednesday they will be
looking for their fourth
consecutive victory when they
travel to Washington, D.C., to
play Georgetown. They will
be looking to avenge an 87-71
loss from Jan. 8.

“We’re on a roll and hopefully
we [can] keep it up at
Georgetown and the rest of
the season,” said Porter. Porter
looks forward to playing against
their tight defense which could
give him the chance to
penetrate.

Morningstar said the
Georgetown game will be a
tremendous test for him since
they have the tough front-line
combination of Alonzo
Mourning and Dikembe
Mutombo. “I've looked forward
to playing Georgetown ever
since I’ve been at Pittsburgh,”
said Morningstar.

Porter feels the players are
finallyused to their roles and
this year’s position changes
and are prepared for the
remainder of the season.

Lady Panthers defeat
Georgetown on road

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

Connie Hurt grabbed a career-
high 17 rebounds and converted
a three-point play with less than
a minute left, to give the Pitt Lady
Panthers a 64-63 victory at
Georgetown on Saturday.

It was Pitt’s first Big East road
win of the season. The Lady
Panthers are now 12-9 overall
and ,4-6 in the conference.

The Lady Panthers are in sixth
place in the Big East, ahead of
Georgetown, St. John’s and
Villanova.

According to head coach Kirk
Bruce, it was an important win
for the Panthers: beating a team
on the road that Pitt had already
beaten earlier this year, 85-72.

“They are a better team now
than when we played them
[before]. Georgetown has been
playing well at home lately,” said
Bruce.

Hurt added a team-leading 23

East this season.

“We kept going to her, and she
responded,” said Bruce.

Hurt is the conference leader
in ﬁeld—goal percentage (64
percent — games through Jan.
28). She shot nine for 12 on
Saturday.

Hurt is the team’s dominant
player right now. Besides leading
the conference in ﬁeld—goal
percentage, she also leads in
blocked shots with 19 (2.4 blocks
per game).

All—American candidate Lorri
Johnson added 16 points. It was
her first game in a week. Doctors
did not allow her to play in the
101-90 loss at home against
Providence last Monday due to
the condition of her knees.
Johnson underwent
reconstructive surgery on both
knees in 1986, and they have

The two exchanged a few
words and stated each other down
for a while before the festivities
ended shortly.

“I guess that was my fault, I just
looked at him and he looked
back. I was pretty intense in the
game. I just wanted to give him
lGreis] a different look,”
Morningstar said.

Is the Panther big man
developing some sort of
intimidation factor?

“I wouldn’t say that wouldn’t
happen, but I’m not trying to and
I hope I continue to be friends
with players around the league.
But it’s an intense game and
everyone is competing to win
and things will happen,”
Morningstar said.

Morningstar believes the team
is finally coming together and he
smells success in the future.

“If we can continue this team
unity, rotate in and out like we
are and everyone trying to provide
as much help as they can so Pitt
»  wins, I think we’re going to be all

Hopefully, if things go well, I’ll
be able to take care of him now.”

Spindler was also guided by
Hackett, who spent eight years in
the NFL ranks.

“Marc and I have talked about
two or three times a week for the
last month,” said Hackett. “Mark
and I have been totally on the
-same page of the discussion in
every area of this.”

Spindler said he will withdraw
from his classes on Monday, and
that he will eventually return to
get his degree.

“I feel very strongly that Marc
should stay here and ﬁnish his
school. But Mark and I have
talked for hours and I understand
his standpoint. I’m disappointed,
but we wish him well.”

Spindler said he does not have
an agent at this time, and he
doesn't have a preference as to
which NFL team he plays for.

Artificial tanning may cause
damage from overexposure

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

A deep, luscious, dark bronze body is usually the hottest commodity around
come spring break time.
While tanning salons offer students a way to arrive at the beaches

THE PITT NEWS, SPRING BREAK 1990, Monday, February 5. 1990

Common sense best defense
against most break hazards

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

Spring break is not the time to forget all of the things your mother taught you
when you were young.
Even though college students often feel invincible, some students

with this already “perfect” tan, some experts warn that sunlamps
and tanning salons increase exposure to harmful ultraviolet rays.
“Tanning salons are still a hotly debated issue, but the research
seems to show that there are some damages. Of course, students
can also harm themselves with overexposure to the sun,” said Dr.
Shirley Haberman, a health educator at Student Health Services.
Gary Buglieski, co-owner of Anytime Tan in Squirrel Hill, said
that tanning under sunlamps is definitely safer than sun exposure.
“The bulbs ﬁlter out the harmful rays,” he said. “I feel a lot safer
with the tanning beds because I am under controlled circumstances.
Some days you go out into the sun for half an hour and nothing
happens; the next day you could go out and get burned. So you
never know.” .
Buglieski said that he has never had any complaints from customers about the
tanning beds. A.
' “In the five years that we’ve been open, no one has had any type of reaction.
My [employees] have to be certified. They watch a [video-training] tape and take
a test so that they are able to answer the questions of the customers,” he said.
Buglieski first tried using tanning beds himself about seven years ago, after he
experienced an allergic reaction to the sun. A
“When I went under the tanning beds, I didn’t break out on my arms like I did
with the sun. I haven’t been in the sun for six years, and I’m always tan,” he said.
' Buglieski said that the taming beds are a good way for students to get a base

may actually die during spring break this year. According to the
Daytona Beach Police Department, four college students have died
during spring break in Daytona over the past two years. _

According to Dr. Shirley Haberman, a health educator at the
Student Health Service, the typical problems that occur during
spring break are overworking one’s body, drinking to excess and
driving while tired or under the inﬂuence of alcohol.

“A lot of students will be traveling long distances. The best thing
you can do for yourself is to stop and take rest breaks every two
hours or so,” Haberman said. “Coffee just doesn’t do it. You’ve got
to take care of yourself.” 1

The danger doesn’t end oncea student sets foot in the sand or
straps on ski boots, however. Whether one will be sunning or skiing, the first thing
to remember is to have adequate protection from the sun.

“Everyone wants to come home with a tan, but you have to remember that your
body hasn’t seen the sun for a while and isn’t used to it,” Haberman said, “Start
out with a sunscreen of 1 5, then, if your body can handle it, use a lower number.”

For a student going skiing, Haberman suggests to layer clothing and allow time
to adjust to the climate and avoid frostbite.

Haberman said, “Typically, and obviously, the main problem during spring
break is drinking. Not only will you get peer pressure from your friends, but [also
from] the beer distributors._ ’

“Beer distributors will be holding all kinds of contests, and their message will

Getting fit for the Week

a top priority for many
break-bound students

By Jenifer Crook
Asst. News Editor

Less than four weeks to go until the big week nearly every
University of Pittsburgh student is waiting for. And no matter if the
destination is the sultry scenes of Daytona Beach or back home in
Dubuque, Iowa, every Collegian wants to look his or her hottest when
spring break finally arrives.

“Yeah, I’ve been working out a little. I wanna look good; lwanna
be a babe—magnet,” said Pitt junior Dave Hoydich.

“\X/e’ve gone lifting a little bit, and we’re playing racquetball,” said
his roommate Kerry Nelligan, “so we can look better on the beach.
So we can take our shirts off and not be ashamed.

“Wehope the girls will get in shape too,” he added.

And where will you be that week?

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

So what is the upper echelon of Pitt society doing
for spring break this yaaar?

For university president Wesley Posvar, business
will be the same as usual. No surﬁng for him. Dr.
Posvar plans to spend the week conducting business
and attending meetings, said Nancy White, assistant
to the president.

“This break is purely for students,” she added.

Not so, said Pitt faculty superstar Theodore
Windt, Ph.D., an expert on presidential rhetoric.

“My tentative plans are to go to Florida and take
thentnanuscript of a book I just completed and do
some ﬁnal editing,” he said. “However, how much
work I get done depends on the weather. If it’s nice,
I’ll be playing golf or swimming instead of [staying]
inside reading.”

Windt, an avid baseball fan, owns a condominium
in Bradenton, Fla., home of the Pittsburgh Pirates’
spring training camp. He said that when the Pirates
are in town, everything else takes a back seat.

“If the Pirates are there, I'll watch them. Forget
the book, forget the golf and forget swimming,”
Windt said. “Everything depends on spring training.
We’re only 15 minutes from the stadium.”

Another Pitt sports fan plans to travel to follow

his team over spring break. Athletic director Edward
Bozik will follow the Panthers into the Big East
Tournament in New York City.

Besides the games that week, Bozik plans to
attend at least two Big East meetings, a press
conference and a basketball awards luncheon. But
Mrs. Bozik has other plans for her husband that
week in the Big Apple. ‘ “

“She expects me to indulge myself one night on

something other than sports,” he said. “Hopefully,

one evening, we’ll get to see a play.”

Which play?

“Me and My Giri” he said.

Student Government Board President Julie
Shepard has tentative plans to go somewhere.

“I have plans to go to Key West, but after talking
with mom and dad, they don’t know if they can
afford it, and I don’t know how much I can

_ contribute,” she said. “I’ll probably go somewhere.

I want to have a good time no matter what. It’s my
last spring break.”

Shepard, a senior, said that if plans to Key West

fall through, she would like to go to Philadelphia _

or Reading, home of huge shopping outlets.

A “But if I don’t go somewhere,” she said, “I’ll go
home and work at Kaufmann’s [in Beaver Fallsl.”

women, muscular men and lots of sun and surf, all courtesy of
the Pitt Program Council. '

“This is the best deal around for students. For $230 they get
more than anyone can offer them," said Tom Misuraca, PPC
adviser.

The PPC trip runs from March 2 to 11 and includes
accommodations at the Clarendon Plaza hotel. Transportation
is also included via tour bus. .

“The buses are maybe a year or two old, and all of them have
TV ’s and VCR’s on board. We provide the movies for the trip.
It is really a good time,” Misuraca said, “The Clarendon is
probably the best hotel in Daytona that will accept students.”

Misuraca said that the PPC trip also includes many activities
and optional side trips.

“We throw ~pool—side parties, and we have side trips to Disney
World, deep-sea fishing and scuba diving,” he said.

Last year the PPC took about 300 students on the trip, and
Misuraca said that he hopes this year the trip will be just as

“We’re on Slim Fast, and we’re
going to a tanning salon, and
we’ve been trying to exercise,”
Natalie Truman, a Pitt junior, said.
“I want to look good so I don’t get
booed off the stage if I enter any
of those contests [in Daytona].”
Becky Brill, also a junior, said
that she has been going on
shopping sprees for new clothes
and is also dieting and exercising.
“l’ve been going to a gym and
doing aerobic videotapes so I
can be in shape for the guys; I
mean the beach,” she said with
a laugh.

not started yet? Let’s face it, one
month is just not enough to
completely eliminate or even
redistribute that extra fat that’s
been sneaking up since
Thanksgiving. At least, not in a
healthy way, that is.

That small setback shouldn’t
matter, however, since according
to some area fitness buffs, it’s all
in the attitude anyway.

“Most people don’t look that bad,
but it’s mostly a mental image,”
said Jim Anderson, a personal
trainer at Forbes Fitness Center.
“Self—image is the most important

especially for girls. They think
they aren’t feminine if they aren’t

‘Oh, I have to lose five or 10
pounds.”

Anderson said that to improve
self-image, a person needs to
begin by just taking daily time to
relax.

“just sit down and breathe
deeply for a while every day,” he
said, “and stretch out your body
to release tension. You’ll feel a
lot better about yourself if you do
it consistently.”

Don’t panic, though, if feeling
good alone is just not enough.
According to Anderson, it is
possible to lose five or six pounds
safely before spring break.

“You should first cut down on
salt and sugar intake. That will
help eliminate a lot of water

weight. Also, smaller meals will
help to speed up metabolism.”
For muscle toning, Anderson
suggests aerobic exercise, such
as jogging, swimming, aerobic
dancing, jumping rope and
running steps. Although training
equipment like Nautilus machines
may help a little, Anderson said
the results will not be that
noticeable by spring break.

The absolute last thing a student
should do, Anderson said, is crash
diet. In fact, it could do much
more harm than good to the
situation.

“When you stop eating, your
body guesses at what’s
happening; it doesn’t know you’re
going to Daytona,” he said. “So

your body takes all the fat from
whatever little you’re eating and
stores it. It can actually make you
gain weight because of this
storing. Normally, the body
digests and metabolizes the food.
That’s why small meals are
important. Crash dieting does
nothing but shock the system.”

Dr. Shirley Haberman, a health
educator at Pitt’s Student Health
Service, agrees.

“I don’t want to encourage
students to crash diet or exercise
like crazy just to look better for
spring break,” she said. “It takes
time to lose weight and get in
shape, and students can harm
themselves or get sick if they try
to do it too quickly.” f

Spring Breozle in Daytona is truly oz wee/e in paradise...

Okay, so it was immature.
Gathering information for one
article on spring break for The
Pitt News last year was the only
constructive activity I engaged in
for the entire week I was in
Daytona. Everything else I did
was destructive, especially to my
wallet and myself. I

For one week, I did not
participate in any intelligent
conversations. I did not follow
what was going on in Iworld
affairs. I didn’t read any fine
literature, play my guitar, or write
anything.

As far as what I did do, you’re
going to have to ask someone
who was there last year and may
have been a witness to my
behavior. I’m am not about to’ go
into speciﬁcs in a publication that

. will be reproduced 16,000 times

and spread all over our fine city.
However, I did have fun — a

* lot of it, in fact—— though I ’m not

sure why. I certainly didn’t relax,

‘ which is what I needed at that

time. Daytona actually served to
burn me out for two weeks after
the trip.

But the best part was just cuttin g
loose. Doing whatever I wanted
to, whenever I wanted to, with

just the barest hint of restrictions
was absolutely wonderful.
Though the weather was lousy
and the drinks expensive, I had
more fun than I had expected.

I was skeptical, even
pessimistic, when I accepted the
trip. I’d been in resort towns
(a.k.a. tourist traps) before, and
spring-break movies were usually
stupid. However, from the
beginning, the trip was cool.

It started. with most of the
people on my bus (except for a
grouchy photographer) drinking
up a storm. I was drunk as a
skunk by the time we were in
West Virginia. This may sound
trite, but remember that we are
talking about a bus ride of at least
18 hours. Getting silly was a
necessity to survive.

The good times continued
almost inﬂhediately after we got
to our destination. So here is a
partial list of things to do while in
Daytona, forthose considering
the trip.

hotel. This way, you can get
together in your rooms to get

contests. We all know that this is
sexist, and that the really
sophisticated people don’t
participate in or watch this type
of activity. However, recent
studies show a correlation
between sophistication and being
drop—dead dull. So go and see

 

these and laugh.

-Go see the wet T-shirt
contests. Spot »Pitt girls so
hammered that they are doing
things they wouldn’twant anyone
back home to know about. Then
youcan blackmail them, should
they see you doing anything that
you wouldn’t want anyone back
home to know about (my sister
and I worked out a similar deal
about tattletales back when John I
Travolta was still on “Welcome
Back Kotter.” Trust me, this
works).

-Get a hot dog at T.C.’s Top
Dog. Florida has its own “O”.

-Go eat” at the Japanese
restaurant up the street. It is one
of those places where the chef
cooks the food over an open
ﬂame right in front of you before
he throws it at you. You will be
enlightened.

-Ask a local where the best
bands play. You won’t find them
yourself, unless you like lame
“glam-metal.”

-Visit the “Rat’s Hole,” a store
owned by Karl “Big Daddy Rat”
Smith. Learn about the bikers.
These are the most interesting, as
well as some of the nicest, people
you will meet in Daytona.

-The rest of the do’s are
obvious.

However, I don’t want anyone
to think that you can’t get into
trouble while in Daytona. Since I
am really concerned about your
safety, here are a few don’ts:

-Don’t jump off of a hotel
balcony. This sounds obvious,
but every year at least one person
dies or is seriously injured playing
this hazardous sport. In fact, the
hotel we stayed in locked the
balconies during spring-break
season. Other hotels don’t do
this, so should you visit a friend
in one of these establishments,

please don’t jump.

-Don’t forget sunscreen and
sunblock. That means
everywhere. Burnt armpits don’t
look very attractive, and don’t
feel too nice either.

0 Don’t go to the 701 Club. That
ape at the door probably still has
my fake I.D., maybe in a collage
of fake I.D.s collected in his
apartment. Boycott this place for
your buddy Lou, who is really
concerned about your safety.

-Don’t get so drunk that you
pass out wearing only shorts and
a T—shirt, curled up next to an air
conditioner that is still on full
blast, despite the fact the
temperature has gone down to
40 degrees. You'll be sorry. I’m
not saying that I did this, of

course, but I’ve heard that it leads V

to terrible colds.

If you gave me a choice
between a trip to Europe and
Daytona, I’d pick . . Europe.
However, Daytona is cheaper.

I could lie and say that ifI had
the money I’d go back again.
However, I’m not sure, since I’ve
never had the money. I won
tickets to go to Fort Lauderdale in
1988, and I was sent with a full

...Unless noise, dmn/eness and perversion are oﬂensive

I had been a photographer for
The Pitt News for over one year
when I received what some might
consider a dream assignment. Last
March I was asked to photograph
the various activities that happen
on a trip to Daytona over spring
break. All expenses paid, no less.

You might think I would be
pretty happy about going to
Florida for free, but the truth is I
was rather apathetic. I had seen
all the movies and had the majority
of those preconceptions that most
of us have about Daytona.

Unfortunately, they turned out
to be true. ‘

Please don’t mistake my
intentions. I am not a prude, and
I firmly believe in having a good
time. However, I was extremely
happy that it was not my own
money I was spending.

The whole thing started in front
of the William Pitt Union. We had
brand-new buses with the latest
comforts, including a bathroom,
color televisions and a VCR. I
figured it wouldn’t be a bad ride.
I could relax and sink my teeth
into that novel I had postponed
reading for so long. This was a
major misconception on my part.

All the breakers decided to

make our bus into a gigantic
party. They spent the majority of
the 18-hour trip chugging alcohol
and being as loud as humanly
possible. The movies were some
comfort when you could hear
them over the Debbie Gibson
tapes. The biggest mistake I made
was placing my bookbag on the
ﬂoor. It took me about four
months to get the beer smell out
of it. (The stains are still there,

however.) The students
hung a garbage bag on the

bathroom door to collect all the

empty bottles. They forgot to
double the bag, however, and
when I accidentally bumped into
and toppled it, the busload of
people tried to force me to clean
it up. After giving them the best
obscene gesture I could think of,

I returned to my seat, hoping the

trip would be far better once we

reached Florida.

It wasn’t.

The hotel seemed fairly decent
at first glance. It turned out to be
slightly less luxuriant than the
parking lot. The maids cleaned
our rooms for about two to three
days but stopped after that. I
guess they figured it wasn’t worth
the effort. It took us three days to

get an extra set of towels.

Even the hotel security was
asinine. No one was allowed to
have any guests in their rooms.
Each student was issued a guest
card which he or she had to show
to enter the elevator or the
stairwells. No card, no dice.

I inquired at the desk and
discovered that this hotel policy
is only in effect during spring
break. Maybe they decided to
treat us like the juveniles we were
pretending to be. When I asked
to complain to the hotel manager
about the rude service at the front
desk, I was told that he didn't
speak to the customers. All
complaints had to be lodged at
the front desk.

The hotel had no problems
taking our money, however. It
had a patio in the rear where all
of the belly-ﬂop and wet T-shirt
contests were held. The beer lines

were longer than most Oakland
Friday—night parties, and they
were making money hand over
foot. 2

The corporate sponsors were
there as well. Chrysler
Corporation decided to get
students out on the patio early
one morning to form its logo

R with their bodies for a TV

commercial by offering 25-cent
drafts. The funny thing was that
they couldn't get enough people,
probably because everyone was
too ‘hung over. I won’t even
discuss the exploitation of the
female students, except to say
that no one was forced to enter
the contests or wear string bikinis.

I mentioned to a newswriter

that he should call his story, “At

Week in Hell With Miffy, Buffy,
Diffy and Daffy." He laughed and
said I was off my rocker.

I remember I wanted to catch
the Daytona spirit in my essay
without leaving a bad impression.
On the inside page, I ran photos
of a male stripper, an enormous
beer line, people watching a belly-
ﬂop contest, and a muscular jack
in a bodybuilding pose.

On the cover, I ran a Pitt student
getting water poured all over her
chest and smiling the whole time.
I think this sums up the entire
trip.

Trust me, breaking is not worth
your money. ‘

  THE PITI‘ NEWS, SPRINGBREAK 1990. Monday, February 5, 1990

Fashion facts for fun in the sun

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

Spring break is right around
the corner, and with that thought
in mind it is time to prepare to hit
the beach with style.‘ Make a
definition and become
recognized!

Focusing on swimwear, “The
bare look is deﬁnitely in, but this
year the one-piece swimsuit is
also going to be popular,” said
Cindy Homer, Kaufmann’s buyer
of junior activewear/swimwear
and also the Esprit Collections.

According to Homer, neon
colors are “hot” for swimwear,
but the bright neon look has

6 been toned downlslightly. Homer

said that one—piece suits are big
this year with the V-neck style

and also with cuts and hole-like
designs on the sides. The bikini is
going as stx ong as ever.

In activewear Homer said that
Lycra shorts are big again this
yean ,
“Vendors such as Ocean Paciﬁc,
Body Glove and L.A. Gear are
popular with college students,”
she said.

Ocean Pacific and L.A. Gear
produce top sales, while Body
Glove is newest to the market
and also slightly more expensive,
said Homer. I

“Print is very big this year.
Pants with geometric prints,
ﬂower prints or any prints are
going to be big for spring break,”
Homer added.

Jeree Reitz, assistant manager
of Scribbles in the Monroeville

Mall, agrees with Homer that
neons are once again very big
this year.

“We have tons of neon clothing,
but we also have a lot of pastel
clothing,” said Reitz.

Reitz added, “Denim shorts with
the rips in them are very big.
Some have cotton cuffs, and they
come in various styles. [For]
underneath the ripped denim
shorts, we are selling black biker
shorts to wear.”

A big name in fashion this year
is Z. Cavaricci, said Reitz. “They
are regular long pants, baggy
style. A very big name in fashion,”
she said.

“Really super-long earrings that
come to the shoulders with a
gold design at the end are big in
accessories,” said Reitz.

“Students are safe because they
are dealing with someone that
they know and can trust. That’s
why they come to us,” he said.

For those who are tired of
Daytona, there are many
alternatives.

“I think pretty much this year
Daytona is out. There are so
many other exciting places
besides the old mainstay,” said
Jim Ramos, a representative of
Sunchase Tours.

Ramos said that more and more
students are staying away from
Daytona this year and are opting
for island vacations and ski
holidays.

be drink, drink and overdrink.
They’ll spend billions of dollars
to get students to not only drink
but to drink excessively.”

Lack of sleep and poor nutrition
will cause some students to come
back in bad health, according to
Haberman. “Students will try not
to spend their money on food, or

' they’ll run out of money and not

eat correctly,” Haberman said.

“Drink lots of non-alcoholic,

ﬂuids, especially if you'll be in a
warm climate,” Haberman
recommended, “andbalance your
diet with fruits, vegetables and
proteins; stay away from fried
foods.

“Try, if you can, to have enough
money to go out to a nice place
for dinner,” Haberman continued.

“Spring break should be a fun
time. It doesn’t have to turn into
a tragedy. Use common sense,”
Haberman said.

“Our South Padre Island
package includes nightly parties
with complimentary beer and
pop, and we have a cookout and
volleyball games. Students seem
to really enjoy these activities,”
he said.

South Padre Island is located
off the southern coast of Texas
and is just above the Mexican
border. Sunchase offers a seven-
night package for $149, not
including plane fare.

“The islands are at good time,
but they aren’t too crowded so
it’s the best of both worlds,”
Ramos said.

Sunchase also offers a package

to Corpus Christi Island, which
costs $99 for ﬁve nights.

“This is deﬁnitely the place to
be. The Royal Resort
condominiums where they stay
are extremely nice. They have so
many extras in the room that it’s
incredible," Ramos said.

For those who don’t crave
sunshine during the break, a few
days of skiing can do the trick.
Sunchase offers a seven-day trip
to Steamboat Springs in Colorado
for $291, which includes a five-
day lift ticket.

“The skiing there is just
fabulous, and for a skiing trip it’s
a great value,” Ramos said.

Tanning

Conttnuedfrom page 2

tan before going to the beaches.

“We strongly suggest that
people come here before going
out in the sun because not only
are you protecting yourself by
getting a base tan, but you are
also more likely to resist the
temptation to go overboard when
you do get out to the beach,” he
said. ~

Haberman said that many
students find themselves getting

Good

burned because they aren’t sure
of the type of protection they
should use.

“You should start with a
sunscreen that has a high number.
Nowadays they have numbers
up to 50. Personally, I think that’s
overkill, but either way, you
should gradually decrease the
number. When I do get burned,
I use homemade remedieslike
tea bags,” she said.

Have fun. Be wild and free.
