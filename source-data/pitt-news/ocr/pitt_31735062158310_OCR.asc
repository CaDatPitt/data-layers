Role of Disciplines;
Peake Chosen Head

(See editorial, page 4)

The University Board of Trus-

tees has authorized the admini-
stration to establish a College of

~ the Academic Disciplines in the

near future. The authorization,

made at a board meeting last.

Tuesday, Dec. 9, approves a struc-
ture which has been under dis-
cussion for several months.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld said that
the new structure ‘is designed to
emphasize the fundamental role of
the academic disciplines in ‘all
programs of. the University.

The College, to be headed by
the Vice Chancellor for the
Academic Disciplines, Dr.
Charles II. Peake, will be made
up of the divisions of the hu-
manities, natural sciences, and
social sciences, all of which
serve the undergraduate, grad-
uate and professional programs
of the University.

Each division will continue to
operate under its own clean with
its own faculty. The departmental
faculties in the academic discip-
lines will‘ continue to serve the
School of Liberal Arts, the pro-
fessional schools, and the new
School of General Studies.

In addition, these faculties will
continue to conduct graduate-level
teaching and research prograr-..; in
their" own ﬁelds.

Board’Aholishes Award

For Top Senior Woman

Mortar Board’s Senior‘Woman, of the Year Award has
been discontinued for this school year.

Reasons given by the organization for the discontinu-
ance are the difficulty of choosing one Woman from a-large

group and the “impossibility
method.” ‘

9 “The vote last year,” said Billie
De Turk, I president of Mortar
Board,.“was not_large enough to
be representative of the senior
Women students on’ campus and it
was felt that enthusiasm concern-
ing the selection of such a woman
was lacking.”

Mortar Board believes that
any appraisal of the individuals
eligible for such an honor
would be too subjective.

The senior women’s honorary
made clear, however, that Mortar
Board this year cannot speak for
the group for years to come since
there is no carryover of members
from one year to the next.

Last year marked the ﬁrst
time this- award was given. For
a number of years, a Senior
Queen who typiﬁed the out- ‘
standing senior woman was
selected. 1

Those who favored’ continued

the fact that such a student serves
as a ﬁgure for underclass women
and future University women to
emulate. They also point out that
it is not the individual but what
she symbolizes which is most im-
portant.

IFC President

Recommends
Three Changes

President Alan Papernick pre-
sented t hr e e recommendations
which will soon be brought up as
motions to be incorporated at the
Interfraternity, Council meeting
last Wednesday.

He recommended that hazing be
abolished from the University
fraternity system; that IF estab-
lish a 1.3 QPA as a prerequisite
for joining a fraternity; that an IF
steering committee take full con-
trol of next year's homecoming.

The present QPA qualiﬁcation is
1.0. In the past_a specially created
homecoming committee has been
in charge of homecoming festivi-
ties. ' »

Papernick’s recommendations
are the result of observations
made at the National Interfra-
ternity Convention in Atlantic

, S Baffling New College

.If.you” cannot understand the page one article ‘on the ’forma-.'
‘ ‘tion of the “College of the Academic Disciplines,” do not be dis-

. gruntledi. r

i For themeaning ofgcollege of disciplines has ‘not been ‘clariﬁed ‘
, and the story in «this paper is necessarily ‘vague because of the
scarcity of information available on this new college. _

The chancellor is scheduled to discuss this new "program to-
morrow and it‘ would have.been preferable for the University‘ to’
-‘wait before releasing anyiinformation until a coherent explanation
of the function and basic purpose of this college. was available. M

Our‘ competent University News Service cannotvbe held at fault
in this matter. Rather, the blame for incompleteness must -lie with
those who give information to the «news service. ‘

Many people have gotten the false impression that this “col- .
‘lege” is a synonym for the school of liberal arts. Even with a
proper release, the name, ‘college of the ‘academic disciplines, is an _
_iunfortunate one- " A l , _ ' ' ‘

. '*-:When anyone-who has ever been associated -with this uni-
versity thinks of the “college,” the_ present school of liberal arts
A» comes to mind, formerly called the college. ‘A S

\ _

The overriding fact is that this college of disciplines ‘will serve

the undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools. and thus have

a a wider scope than the humanities, natural sciences, and ‘social sci-
ences as strictly applied to the undergraduate school of liberal arts.

0 This may.sound muddled, but it is based on the only information

available.

‘ Man/y among the faculty and lower echelon administration have
no idea what the new college is intended tolbe.- They read about it
- in the newspapers which is hardly as it should be. '
-Publicity is fine, but w‘hen.a_ story'is incomplete and mislead- '
ing, it is better left unsaid by the University. ‘

Men's Glee Club, Wor_nen’s Choral Society, Var-

ﬂsity Quartet; two or» three pianos, cookies, and
-some unpunched spike. Nice evening. That was

Wednesday, at _athe_ Christmas concert festivities
presented by" the student «musical groups. ,
Some people don’_t seem to be aware that these
groups exist. They do. “ They are
even worth listening to. At this
concert they presented tradi-
tional songs, show tunes, bar-
bershop, and_ other very’ pleas-e
ing miscellany done in just the
right 0 manner.  . i ’
Since ‘nobody has written

offer a few words of descrip-  .
tion. The group, is about ﬁfty. strong and‘ sports a
ﬁne, full, ‘transparent tone, exceptional ‘low-bass
sonority and an excellent leader in David _Weiss.

The Bolero-type "Hebrew song “El-Yivneh,”

_ gave an example of how the men have mastered

the art of making all the-lines of a complex pas-

_sage clear and evident." The Glee Club is versatile,

too; they can sing “Hail to Pitt” without shouting,
and they can imitate a Latvian Band.iThis is‘
indescribable; it must be heard.

x \ _

some of the polish of the Men’s"group, but still
displayed a pleasing ton‘e when singing ‘without a
piano, which is a real accomplishment. _
Once started on a given pitch, they did not
wander up or down. The singing of ballads, chil-

\dren’s songs, and Christmas carols‘ was quite

stylish. So were the young ladies. Their diction

was good too. I

Some ﬁne entertainment separated the produc-
tions of the two choruses. Gary Weis‘ and Jerry
Justh did some duo—piano work: Scaramouche, by

‘Milhaud,.which is one of the most ‘abortive at-

tempts to' put old ‘tunes in classical form that I

have _ever heard, and a Brahms—Hungarian—Rhap-_

sody - that — led - into .— a - parody - of - God -

knows-what which“ was jarring and distasteful.

Well played, though. ‘
Sandwiched in between these “creations” was
one of Bach’s loveliest inspirations, “Sheep May

wSafely Graze,” played gracefully by Weiss an

Carolyn Dundore. \

Then the fun began. That collective crewcut,
the Varsity Quartet, rendered “Daddy Was a Yale
Man” and similar raunch. The Quartet ‘operates

I   Letters To The Editor

Improved ‘Salaries Cited‘

By University ‘Senate
Editor, The Pitt News:'

I have read with interest Miss
Lorraine Lesoon’s article, “The
Best Investment,” in the Decem-
ber 3’issi1e of The Pitt News. It

' is heartening to realize that the
students of the University are
concerned about the economic
status of the faculty, and’ that
theyzarie urging continued im-
provement of that status,

The article has an unfortunate
overtone, however, for it implies
that the administration is in-
different to the welfare of the
faculty and that, little_ has been
done to date regarding this im-
portant matter. '

Let me -cite a few statistics and
facts to'i-ndicate some steps that
have been taken. The total direct-

" expenditures for_ full-time, fac-

ulty salaries have increased from
‘ $3,673,430 -in the academic" year
1954-1955 to $6,045,806 ‘in 1958-
_ 1959:=‘The increase.‘ has resulted
‘from, a 30.5% rise in average
salaries and the addition‘ of full
time faculty, from 561 in 1954-
1955 to .707 in 1958-1959. '
Members of our faculty are
now enjoying further advantages
through additional fringe beneﬁts

provided by the present admini-

stration. These beneﬁts constitute
increases in indirect income. Life
insurance coverage for the aver-
age faculty member has been
gnorethan doubledw ‘ »
A major medical insurance
program has been introduced to
, help faculty members guard
. against the catastrophe of want
-‘should they become seriously ill
and unable to perjorm _.their
"duties at the University. , '
' Increases in the contribution of
the University to an annuity pro-
gram for faculty members have
also been e1fected.’The costs of
these annuity and insurance pro-
grams have increased the expen-
ditures of the University from
$174,000 in 1954-1955 to almost

a half million dollars during the

present academic year.

Increased research facilities, a
program of sabbatical leaves for
associate and full professors, and
arrangements with Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology to permit
facultymembers to pursue ad-
vanced study at the Institute
without expense to themselves
are other advantages gained ‘by
our staff since Chancellor Litcli—
ﬁeld took office,

A new policy regarding grad-_

uate student assistants, designed
to. improve the economic status of
this group, has been announced
’ recently. Beginning with-* the aca-

   
   

in ‘remuneration of about 25%,

the exact amount being depen-
dent onthe achievement of each
' individual in scholarship.

~ Miss Lesoon’s article brings to
the fore a most important point
of view. If gifted students are
to be attracted to the ‘profession
of college teaching, and if the
University hopes to retain the
competent members of its staff,
both prospective , teachers" and
our present faculty mus_t.be as-
sured that the profession will

bring vthem..ﬁ'nancial, as well as.

academic, rewards. A
Let us hope that the improve-
ments . brought ‘about over ‘the
past three years in the Univer-
sity will continue, and ’ that
teaching, as a - profession will
gain in dignity and stature.

‘Elevator,  Blocked’
Says. Industry Professor

‘Editor, The Pitt News: ‘
. As you are undoubtedly well

' aware a great deal of the eleva-
tor’s time is consumed. in load-
ing and unloading passengers,
and any~increase in the efficiency
with which this could be accom-
plished would not" only improve
elevator’service, but perhaps also
reduce cost. " ’_

I would like to offer the fol-
lowing suggestions: ' N

1. 'One of the reasons for the
excessive loading time’ is the fact
that students waiting to board
the elevator standiin the door-
way blocking the exit of those
trying to get out. I should think
that this particular problem
could" be aided by having it
established as a ﬁrm rule of Uni-
versity courtesy that people wait-
'ing to board the elevator keep
the doorway clear.

This could probablybe done
by an initial campaign in the
Pitt News and by student organi-
zations, and could be maintained
in the future by having this in-
cluded in the" orientation pro-
gram of new students, and men-
tioned in any student handbooks.

It would also probably be’

helpful to have a sign to this
effect in the elevators, and for
the elevator operators to speak
to those individuals who con-
tinue to ignore this rule of
courtesy. ' .
L 2. The other major reason for
excessive. loading time is the
fact "that those wanting to get
out of the elevator soonest so
often are located furthest from
the door, and with everyone fac-
.ing. the door‘, 'it_ is impossible to

    
 

‘know _WhO, is trying .to get opt.
 Here-.,ar;e,,two proposals;  - g __— ,-

floors from the middle of the
doorway to’ the back wall, and
paint one side a bright color.
-Those wanting to get out at early

stops would then stand on one.

side, those at later stops on the
other. , . ‘

Or it might be better to have
one side for upper floors, the
other for lower, so that people

A going regularly to particular.

floors would get in the habit
of standing on a particular side.
b) Place a wide mirror above
the ‘door, so that people facing
‘the door can see who‘ behind
them are trying to get out and
can move in the appropriate di-
rection. _

_Ches_t Group Extends

Fund. Drive Deadline

Editor, the Pitt News:

Thank you for the ﬁne edi-
torial of December 3, concerning
the Pitt Chest Fund Drive and
its failure_to collect a satisfac-
tory contribution. As it will be
recalled, last year’s campaign
was considered somewhat a fail-
ure, even though $2,000 was paid
in. Thus far, we have collected
only $1,000 this year!

The campaign, has received

“ more compliments than money.

Until a largerlsum of money is
realized, we of the Committee‘
cannot help feeling that the stu-
dents of the University have not
accepted their responsibility to-
ward students less fortunate than
themselves.

’ _Therefore, we have made it
possible for those students who
have not yet given to get con-
tribution’ envelopes. Containers
of these envelopes have been
placed throughout the Cathedral
aiid Student Union. The envel-

» opes may be returned to the stu-
dent desk.

We hope that the student body
will display more enthusiasm
with this additional opportunity.

Michael Altman
Chairman, Pitt Chest

Economics was discovered by the Englislumtn, Adam Smith.
He published his ﬁndings in 1786, but‘ everybody giggled so
hand that Smith, blushing hotly, gave up the whole thing and
went into the cough drop business with his brother. ' -

For long years after that economics lay neglected while the
world busied itself with other things, like the birth of Victor
Hugo, the last days of Pompeii, and the Bunny Ilug.

Then,o_ne day while flying a kite during a thundc1'storm, the
 American, Henry George (also called Thorstein Veblen), dis-
‘ covered the law of diminishing returns, and then, boy, the fat
was in the ﬁre! Before you could say “knife” the Industrial
Revolution was on! M cchanization and steam power resulted
- in prodigies of production_. For example, before the Industrial
Revolution, a Welsh artisan, named Dylan Sigafoos, used to
make horse—shoes by hand at the rate of four a day. After the
Industrial Revolution, with the aid of a steam engine, Sigafoos
was able to make entire horses! '

And so it went-factories rising from the plains, cities bur-
geoning around the factories, transport and commerce keeping
pace—until today, thanks to economics, we have smog, reces-
sions, and economics textbooks at $7.50 per copy.

Clemson Takes 3rd

By LARRY HAGGERTY

The Panthers won their sec-
ond Steel Bowl basketball
tournament title by trounc-
ing the Duquesne Dukes, 71-
56, last Saturday night at the
Field House. It enabled the

squad of Coach Bob Timmons to

of new marks.

His 59 points in the tournament (26 against Miami’ and
33 against the Dukes) eclipsed Dick Ricketts’ 1954 mark of

58 for the Steel Bowl, and his 21%

free throws topped the previous
Bowl record of 20, set by George
Washington’s Joe Holup in 1954.

Hennon’s point total for the sea-
son now is 128, good for an aver-
age of 32.0 per outing. He is shoot-
i-ng 37.9 per cent from the ﬁeld.

=|= ‘ *

He is constantly up on his feet,
shouting instructions to his play-
ers. For example, his chattering
strategy Saturday night against
Hennon went something like this:

“C’mon Red (Ryan), overplay

him. Now, Red. Overplay. Okay,‘

Clemson ﬁnished third by beat- e er e enslve P ay as e Sea‘ '

ing Miami (Fla.), 66-61.

“There were three basic factors
associated with our triumph over
Duquesne,” declared the happy

7 Timmons in the dressing room fol-

lowing the tilt that was witnessed
by a capacity crowd of 5,265. This
was the eigth annual Steel Bowl
classic.

Lou Iezzi’s scouting report on the
Dukes.” . .
‘Right Hand’ Helps

Iezzi, who serves as Timmons’
assistant and chief scout, is an
alumnus of Duquesne. He gradu-
ated in 1955 and enrolled at the
Skyscraper U. Dentistry "School.
Since then he has been the “right
hand man” of Timmons.

His chief duty so far this sea-
son has been to follow the Dukes
as much as possible. “He did
his job so efficiently that we
knew just about every possible
maneuver that the Dukes’ coach,
Red Manning, would try against

-us," Timmons added. V

Mills played the best game of his
career against the team from the
Bluff as he held Slobodnik to just
one field goal. The 6-5 junior from
Beaver also contributed 12 points
and grabbed ten rebounds.

Never Behind.

Hennon, as usual, showed why
he is an AllAmerican player as he
‘tallied .33 points on ten ﬁeld goals
and 13 foul shots in‘ leading the
Jungle Cats to victory.

Except for ties at 1-1, 8-8, and
10-10, the Panthers were in
complete charge of things for the
entire 40 minutes. A long ﬁeld 7
goal by Hennon at the eight-
minute mark put the Blue and
Gold ahead to stay 12-10. At
halftime the Panthers led 37-25.

The closest the Dukes came in
the second _half was at 16:02 when
a jump shot by Willie Joe Hunter
cut the Panthers’ margin to 57-48.
Duquesne was handicapped when
Slobbo, Hunter, Bernie Matthews,
and George Brown all had to

leave the gamelate in the second .
half because of ﬁve personal fouls. E

Injuries Hurt

“Matthews and Ryan were hob-
bled by injuries and I feel that
this was a great blow to Du-
quesne,” Timmons stated. Mat-
thews was bothered by a sore left
toe while Ryan aggrevated an old

Not to be overlooked in the
Panthers’ tremendous win over
the Bluﬁites, was the ﬁne play
of John Fridley, Dick Falenski,
Mike Ditka, and Bill Shay.

Fridley, the sophomore star
from Sharon, led the Jungle Cats
in rebounds with 115. He also
registered nine points. Falenski
and Shay alternated at the one
guard position opposite Hennon
and scored six and two points,
respectively.

Ditka, the fugitive end from
John Michelosen’s football team,
scored only two points, but played
exceptionally well defensively as
a reserve for Fridley, Mills, and
Dave Sawyer.

The/ top scorers for Duquesne
were Hunter with 11 points and

Dick Berghoff, was held score-
less for the second straight night.

lied 17 points forthe losers.

Inﬁrst round play Friday night,

the Dukes defeated Clemson, 71-54, ,

and the Panthers downed Miami,

The Panthers now‘ have won
three games in a row, losing only
to Michigan in the opener. The
Dukes have now dropped below

which came here undefeated, went

two wins and four defeats. ,

Miami also saw its high point

Mike Ditka is another fellow
who will be seeing more action
because of his play on defense
and under the boards. The foot-
baller has been termed the Pan-
thers’ hatchet man, but the Dukes’
George ,Brown, who is a roughy
himself, doesn’t think .so.

After the game Brown was talk-
ing about Ditka. “Heck, he’s no
hatchet man,” Brown declared.
“He’s good. He was all over me
all the time he was in there. I
couldn’t get away from him.”

method of coaching during a game,
