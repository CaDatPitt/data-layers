Prompted by the belief that “the
selection and promotion of the fac-

college or university,” Dr. Lunden
attempts to provide a competent
“gauge” by which college adminis-
trators and active university profes-
sors alike may check efﬁciency and
advancement in the individual pro-
fessor.

With this aim of providing a yard-
stick of eiﬁcienucy, the author dis-
cusses the origin, structure, and func-

terms the work: “Not only the best

Educated at Gustavus Adolphus €
college, Dr. Lunden holds a M. A. de-
gree from the University of Minne-
sota and a Ph. D. degree from Harv-
ard. He taught at Minnesota college,
Northwestern College of Law, and
Augsburg college before coming to
the University in 1930.

[chaplain to the Roman Catholic stu-
]dents, at the Newman Club spon-
;sored Lenten service, tomorrow at 1

l Second in a series of Lenten serv-

conducted by the Newman Club as
its part in the combined religious
program.

Father Rock is also chaplain in the
same capacity for Carnegie Institute
of Technology.

Last Thursday’s service was pre-

sented by the YMCA and the YWCA
with Dr. H. A. Dalzell of the Shady-

sponsoring the series.

Coed Rushees
‘Will Receive
Fraternity Bids

With __the close of rushing activi-
ties at 12 o’clock Saturday night, si-
lence week for fraternity women
and rushees will be observed until 5
o’clock, Friday afternoon.

Invitations have been sent out
from the oﬁice of the dean of women
and answers to bids must be re-
turned to that ofﬁce by 9:30 o’clock
Friday morning. Fraternities may
get their acceptance lists from the
clean of women’s ofﬁce at 5 o’clock
Friday.

Because some girls get bids does
not necessarily mean that she has
received a bid from the fraternity of
her ﬁrst choice on the preferential
ballot. But she has been bid by
some fraternity on campus, and her
acceptance depends on the quota for
that particular fraternity.

According to Mrs. Edna Batz, as-
sistant in the dean of women’s oﬁice,
442 pieces of literature have been
sent out from the oﬂice during this
last week for rushinghand bidding.

An interesting feature in this
year’s rushing, according to Mrs.
Batz, is that the majority of the girls
received invitations from more than
one fraternity. In past years, girls
have usually received bids from just
one fraternity.

Holhrook Explains
WPA Courses

The following statement has been
issued by E. A. I-Iolbrook, Dean of
the Schools of Engineering and Mines,
in regard to the WPA course being
given free of charge every Wednes-
day and Friday from 3:30 to 5:30
o’clock in 206 Cathedral.

“The free courses on Diesel en-
gines to be held in the Cathedral of
Learning are not a University proj-
ect, and are not in any way a part
of any program of the Engineering
School of the University of Pitts-
burgh. No university credit can be
claimed by reasons of attendance in
the courses. It is our understand-
ing that the University simply pro-
vides space for the courses as part
of a vocational program sponsored

 

by the VVPA.”

‘€iassical Weekly’ Editor Uses

Two Human Addressographs

As true classicists should, the pub-
lishers of the Classical Vieekly, ed-
ited by Dr. James Stinchcomb, head

of the department of classics, have
rejected the use of a mechanical ad-
dressograph in addressing the Week-
ly and have adopted instead two hu-
man addressographs.

Addressographs Margie Bedner,
C41, and Esther Marcuson, C41, have
mailed over 30,000 copies of the
Weekly by hand since its home was
moved to the Cathedral last fall.

Their mailing list includes the
British royal family, the Royal In-
stitutes of Italy and Sweden, all of
the leading libraries of Europe and
America, most of the American col-
leges, and almost every classical
scholar of note.

Margie Bedner and Esther Marcu-
son probably know more classical
scholars by name than any other liv-
-Ing human beings, according to Dr.
Stinchcomb. They call most of these
scholars by their ﬁrst names.

The Classical Weekly is sent to all
parts of the world, to place as far
apart as Jerusalem and Pippa Passes,
Kentucky, and to places so ideologic-
ally divergent as Moscow and the Va-
tican. Even Walpwallapin, Pa., gets
a copy. Every week’s issue is regu-
larly mailed to the American univer-
sities in China, but whether they
get there is a question.

“When I can’t sleep I don’t count
sheep, I just recite the names of

classical scholars,” says Miss Bed-

’ basic frocks with contrasting jack-
ets (a potent pair for Spring fes-
tival, galas), frocks with petticoat
ruffles, new tiered skirts (like the
one in the show today), sparkling
prints, Whirligig skirts and senti-
mental lingerie touches. (Prices on
these lovelies begin at $7.95 at
llosenbaum’s)

And for your complete enchant-
meat, heaps of beautiful, delicate
jewelry to smother your wrists
and throat when you wear a
dressy afternoon. dress. Tinkling
sea shells, colored bubbles and
ﬂowers . . these trinkets are full
of social signiﬁcance this Spring.

‘Comes evening and you dash
home to remove any traces of your
daytime “little girl” look. The
young man who bought you a coke
at 5 P. M. (when you were wear-

arrive at the Military Ball with a

A long life and;

College men going into the bus-
iness world must look like bus-
iness men. Ernployers are skep-
tical, but  you look the part you
can probably talk the part ‘and
bingo; you’re in! Most any man
can wear a double breasted suit.
For job hunting occasions, dark
colors are most suitable, not con-
spicuous conservative, al-
ways! Wear a pin or cluster
stripe, an oxford or what—have-
you. 'I‘he model however may be
extrerne lots of drape and
stuff, but keep your colors well in
hand. Wear _your favorite hat

homburg or other town
model . . . your black or tan
shoes as the ensemble demands,
white or colored shirt with stiff
collar and cuﬁs. . And there’s an
outﬁt that would refute any em-
ployer’s idea (and lots of them
have it) that college men ‘are T.
N. T. wrapped in parchment, to be
handled with extreme caution
and not—so-much-consideration! i

How do you go awooing‘? You’ll»
never disagree that comfort is a
prime requisite of this ancient art ,
so aptly applied by students. Vi/‘hen
the Esquire boys taught us about
semi-sports wear, wooers woes
were greatly decreased. You
know, next to actual campus wear,
§t"s about the most important.
group of men’s wear to become
popular in the past decade. You
can wear sezni-sports most any-
where . . always be comfortable
and never conscious of being over
or under dressed, but just right
e:~:r.-opt of course for formal affairs".
The t'abrics offered in this group-
ing are most always on the soft"
side cut and-model, always
very casual . . the three-button
jacket being the best seller. This
 the grouping where you may
wear either the new Dutch inspir-3
ed footgear or the regular stree-‘.‘
shoe . the many shaped Tyr-
oleans or your favorite snap brim

your wool socks or ones of
sill< or lisle.

What about formals? What’s
new?‘ Well, not a whole lot, ex-
cept that trousers are still higher
rise than ever they should
break a bit at the shoe tops. Vests
have deﬁnitely taken on lapel.-1
and should always be in matching
pique to your bow tie. The high-
est collar you can buy is the one
to wear. Show all the starchecl
white you can . . several inches
at the sleeves being a most im-
portant must! And here’s a

note for fashion radicals! Dou-
ble breasted tuxedos are never
no never, never correct

for formal affairs. They should
be worn with a turn down collar
with or without stiff bosom and
only for dinner never for
zlancing. The single breasted tux
 something different. It may go
either to dinner or to dance . . . -
Z‘-.’s sort of the semi—sports suit oil
the formal group! Keep your der-
bies intact only for town or sports
wear . . go hatless before you
humiliate yourlorrnal attire with
this deﬁnitely informal headgear.
What are you fellows going to
wear for golfing, tennis. badmin-
ton and other spring and summer
sports? VVhat’s the matter with a
two piece hopsacking sports en-
szrmble like the one we’ve shown
at the ri'-‘ht? It’s surprising how
inexpensive they are
We‘re really not meaning to be
cranks! We know the regulations
that must be made in order to
meet so many college require-
ments ﬁnancial and other-
wise! We’re just pointing out the
facts of the leaping and bound-
iig men’_s fashion world so that
when you do spend your money
. you’ll do it wisely . . . that’s
where Rosenbaum’s comes in. And

now let's‘ watch the show!

‘looms Meet
J. Carroll

Facing their second high class op-
ponent in less than 24 hours, John
McSor1ey’s icers engage Eddie Ar-
senault and the John Carroll Blue
Streaks at Cleveland this afternoon.

The Panthers played a 2-2 over-
time tie with the Clevelanders in the
opening game of the year when
Arenault whipped in the deadlock-
ing score late in the third period.

A Pitt win today would mark the
ﬁrst time the Panthers have ever de-
feated John Carroll. Two
during the regular season last year
resulted in a Carroll victory and a
1-1 tie. Later, in the league playoffs,

the Panthers took two trimmings
from the Clevelanders.
At the present time, the Blue

Streaks have snapped out of a lapse
that slowed them up for part of the
season and are rolling along at top
speed. With Arsenault and Fred
Rancouzt ﬂashing opponents’ goal
lights, the Carr-ollers will be hard to
beat

Pitt was in C’ee\*ele.nd lust Satur-
day L0 play the last place Baldwin-
Wallace sextet and responded with
a lethargic 4-0 victory over the club
that Duquesne has twice beaten by
11-0 counts.

Trying to give everyone a chance
to score, the‘Pitts passed and passed,
i:s.‘.:he1‘ than shooting.

THE PITT NEWS

Masaryk Strikes Hopeful lﬂalnpus Canvass
Note for Democracies

Czech Dedicator E
Calls U. S. World’s g
‘Spiritual Center’ 

“I’m the small son of a great father 
and I hate like hell to have all thisi
publicity, because it belongs to him,” 
Jan Ivlasaryk, six feet tall v.‘i1;h 
build like a Sutherland tackle, saidé
yesterday morning, adding “It‘s af
good thing my father had a great;
sense of humor.”

Masaryk, former Czecho-Slovakl
minister to Great Britain, was in;
Pittsburgh to speak at a series of}
events commemorating the birthday}
of his father, the late Thomas G.l,
Masaryk. He gave the dedicatory‘
address at the Czecho-Slovak Room‘
dedication in the Commons Room last 9
night.

The nationality rooms in the Cathe
dral, as the community of nationsl
represented under one roof, living in
peace and cooperation, greatly im-
pressed Masaryk. “How I wish
Europe was like that!” he said.

The nationality rooms are only‘
part of the exemplifying proof that
the spiritual leadership of the world
is more and more being centered in
the United States, the speaker con-
tended, saying:

“I am happy that my father’s
ideology has found a safe abode in a
free institution, in a free country,
among free people.”

The outward form of democracy,
the vote, is insigniﬁcant in Masaryk’s
estimation. “Freedom of human soul
is democracy. It is an individual’s
right to live without interference.
Give me $35 a week and an occasion-
al glass of beer—enough to keep body
and soul together—under a democ-
racy and I wouldn’t take thousands
anywhere else.”

He then struck a hopeful note for
democracy. It is his belief that all
democracy needs to combat the mar-
tial-music aspect of the totalitarian
government is a little “paint.”

In reference to the Munich pact,
Masaryk observed that although
Czecho-Slovakia may be a puppet
state of Germany now, its people are
“the toughest in Europe.” The re-
mainder if Czecho-Slovakia is still
self-sufficient to a degree greater than
any other European nation, and the
border which was violated was “the
oldest frontier in Europe.”

“Chamberlain and Daladier were
only having fun at someone else’s ex-
pense,” he said. “This is the ﬁrst
peacetime treaty where a nation has
been ‘sold up the river’ and the chick-
ens will come home to roost.”

“It must be realized,” he said, “that
there is deﬁnitely not a deﬁnite situ-
ation in Europe. The changing scene
such as is there at present has never
appeared in history before.”

Tyson Predicts
Business Gain

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics, talking before the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania Alumni
group at the Harvard-Yale-Prince-
ton club last Monday, predicted a
general trend towards recovery in
the Pittsburgh area.

“Investment in public utilities and
the need of equipment for the mod-
ernization and rehabilitation of rail-
roads,” Dr. Tyson declared, “will
bring to the Pittsburgh area the
steel output necessary for prosper-
ity.”

He believes that by the coming
spring, America will be on her way
to full recovery. “It appears that
the more extreme political leaders
are willing to allow business to take
the lead in solving the problems of
revival and expansion of the pro-
ductive system,” explained Dr. Ty-
son. ‘

He stated that the present danger
lies in a drift toward a premature
state action and that a study of some
of our new reform programs, such as
the Social Security Act, might show
that the administration of them cost
more than the beneﬁts derived.

 The Question:
§ WHAT IS YOUR OPINION or DR.
ESUTHERL./..-‘€D’S RESIGNATION?

 The Answers:

vDR. JULES LABARTHE:

l
3 I don’t see how we can lose our
;most

loyal alumnus and

coach in the country.

BILL IIOEVELER, C39:

It is too bad that Dr. Sutherland
Rather we might say he
was forced to resign. Three years of
uphill ﬁghting gets a little tiresome
and the “love for Alma Mater” can be
tried too often.

WILLIAM J. KRZTON, Ed39:

Here, at last, is proof that a foot-
ball team cannot be “unprofessional”
and winning at the same time. The
greatest coach today concedes it by

'not wishing to jeopardize his reputa-

tion. The University, however, loses

most.

‘FABIAN H. HOFFMANN, Ed39:
Chancellor Bowman built a build-
ing. Dr. Sutherland built Pitt. It
does not seem right that Dr. Suther-
land should be forced out of this in-
stitution which he loves so much.

JACK HOEVELER, C40:

I am shocked at the great apathy
of the student body toward this situ-
ation.

MIZZIE WALTER, C391/2:

Of course Jock’s leaving is a blow
to every student, but perhaps it is
best for the Administration’s plans.

ROBERT STUCHELL, Eng42:

signing. He would be the loser if he
continued to stay on with the present
University policy on athletics.
DONALD DULACK, C42:

I still think Dr. Sutherland is go-

HEVS

the best,
! friend of the youngsters in Pittsburgh i attempts of the administration to ra-
ieven if he were not the best i'octball.tio:1.aliZe this loss should prove im-

I think Sutherland was right in re-;

iing to stay. He is too well liked by
ttlie students. I clon’t think he has
abeen treated justly but he should not
:leave.

;'1"Ii‘.I RAKER. C40:

The new Pitt athletic policy has
;defeate-d itself at every turn.
fculmination of the whole rottenness
has been the loss of Sutherland. The

- i:i:=nsely interesting.
 SC'HEIDI;‘~EG'. C39:
§ Jocl:’s resignation comes as no sur-
? prise to me. A coach of his character
, and reputation would naturally feel
; cut of place at a university w ich has
gdeenied it advisable to relegate foot-
:ball to the status of just another col-
glege sport.

LOUISE SMITH. C41:

Dr. Sutherland"s resignation is the
worst thing that could have happened
to the University short of bombing
the Cathedral. As a character, and a
leader of men he is unexcelled at Pitt.
IKE WEINER, Ed39:

The resignation of Dr. Sutherland
will most probably be the straw that
breaks the panther’s back.

Ellis Names Aides
