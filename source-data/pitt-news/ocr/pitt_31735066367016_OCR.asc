I Students Carry Petition
5 Urging Quick Action
OnState Relatedness

By DAN BOOKER

All the legislators gave as
surances it would pass some-
time. But Mahmood Mam-
dani, Steve Leightman, and
Dan Stern, University stu-
dents who journeyed to Har-
risburg yesterday, also
heard State House and Sen-

ate leaders pass the prover-
bial buck when
asked why state-
relatedness for
 the University
 is not already a
fact.

Joshua Eilberg,
speaker of the
House, laid the
~ blame entirely

MAMDANI an the Senate,
while Senate leaders insisted that
the Democratic-dominated House
had caused the delay in consider-
ation of University legislation.
This backbiting impression was
so strong that all three students

    

‘noted it, and Leightman remark-

ed that, “It seems like we're

jnﬁback where we started.”

Expressions of “deep concern”
and assurances of the passage of
state-relatedness from Senators
Robert’D. Fleming, chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee; William Lane, minority
whip; and ‘Stanley Stroup, a
member of the Appropriations
Committee, and from Representa-

 

tive Jeanette Reibman, chairman
of the House Education Commit-
tee, were not enough to override
the general feeling of political
haggling sensed by the students.

Stern said that the legislators
seemed to be “taking there own
good time in ‘dealing with Pitt
legislation.” He also felt that the
question of state-relatedness had"
been taken out of the educational
sphere and made a political is-
sue.

Armed with a. petition urging I

quick action, Leightman, Stern,
and Mamdani were introduced to
the state legislators by Frank
Matthews, Harrisburg correspon-
dent for the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, Whose recent articles
have been highly critical of legis-
lative action in the last six
months, especially on the state-
relatedness i"s-
. sue.

The petition
carried to the
state capitol had

for only four

 

before the stu-
dents’ journey

574 signatures. '

legislators, Stern feels that they‘

For a moment yesterday
it seemed as if Pitt was fin-
ally going to become a state-
related university. But Re-
publican Senate leaders de-
cided to play politics a little
longer.

Pennsylvania’ Governor
William W. Scranton finally
made a long-awaited an-
nouncement on what kind of
tuition reduction he favors
for Pitt. Scranton told State Sen.

that he wanted tuition down to

Peace Group Questions ROTC 

The role of ROTC on the Uni-
versity. campus is being chal-

lenged by Students for Peace‘

(SP). SP claims that ROTC should
not be part of the freshman ori-
entation because it is, “military
indoctrination.” Dean of Student
Affairs Helen Pool Rush has re-

fused to call a special meeting‘

of the Orientation Committee to
consider this challenge.

When refusing to call the meet-
ing, Miss Rush said, “I won’t put

ROTC ‘on trial. The orientation
meeting is simply for informa-
tion, not recruitment.”

Lt. Colonel Benjamin Hollis,
professor of military science said
he has nothing to do with the
ori_entation program. He believes
ROTC “definitely” belongs on the
University campus. It has been

place in the University curricu-
lum,” said Frank Kofsky, teach-
ing fellow of history. Comment-
ing on Dean Rush’s decision,
Kofsky said, “The administration
in general, Miss Rush in particu-
lar, deals by ﬁat with étudents
when she can get away with it.”
He believes “students should pro-
test her response.

Kofsky said that when ‘legal
and rational means are blocked,
students should go through other

channels. A Communist can be ‘

hired to speak during the orien-
tation program as the govern-
ment hires‘ ROTC men, Kofsky
suggested. If you set a prece-
dent for the government you
must let everyone follow it.

“I’d rather not see ROTC on
UniVeI‘Sity campuses but it is

necessary,” said Robert W. Avery »

Associate Professor of Political

“ROTC has a place in the orien-
tation program. A lot of students
want to be officers and they have
a right to learn about it,” he
commented.

“From what I understand,”
Vice-President of Student Gov-
crnment Howard Ainisman said,
“it would seem to me that who-
ever made the decision should
have at least allowed SP to state.
their reasons why ROTC should
be removed from the orientation
program or removed from cam-
pus. That would be the most
logical thing to\do.” ‘

Scranton also told Fleming
that he would sign the Pitt billl
under the above terms even
though the general appropria-
tions bill had not been passed
yet.

However, the Senate Republi-
can leadership committee refused
to take the Pitt Bill out of com-
mittee and vote on it before the
general appropriations bill was
signed. Members of the leader-
ship committee include Senate
Majority leader Stanley G. Stroup
(Rep.-Bedford), Majority Whip

City), Sen. James S. Berger

Fleming. -

Sen. Stroup said that he feels
that the Pitt, Temple and Penn
State appropriations bill should
be passed simultaneously. But
Temple and Penn State differ
from Pitt because students at
the other two schools already
have $450 tuition rates. Pitt’s tui-
tion officially remains at $1,400
per year until-the General As-
sembly acts.

\

,Flemi.ng said the leadership
committee felt it was “good busi-

.ness” to ﬁrst act on the general

appropriations bill because the
State Constitution mandates that
matters concerning the general
operations of the Commonwealth
be the ﬁrst concern of the legis-
lature.i -

However, the General Assem-
bly already has passed and the
governor has already signed two

non-preferred appropriations this,

session. One was a $250,000 ap-
propriation to Penn State for an
off-campus center at O1/instead.
Air Force Base. The governor
signed that April 28. The other is
a $50,000 appropriationto Moore
College of Arts, at Philadelphia,
recently passed and signed.

This leaves Pitt legislation back

where it was before Gov. ‘Scran-

ton conferred with Sen. Fleming.
The general appropriations bill
still has to be settled before the
Pitt legislation can be considered.
Sen. Fleming has asked that a
Joint House - Senate conference
committee be called to settle the
appropriations bill controversy.

This conference committee can
not be called until the House
votes down the general appro-
priations bill passed by the Sen-
ate. Right now the Senate bill _is_

Play Ball Boys

Pitt’s The Game

Let’s face the facts. Our University has
become a political football. Today the Sen-
ate could have passed Pitt legislation, but
the Republican leadership couldn't resist
the. opportunity to get the maximum politi-
cal mileage out of the University's crisis.

The Pitt bill is being needlessly held up
on the basis that legally it can not be passed

A until the general appropriations bill goes

through. Legally it CAN be passed before
- general appropriations are settled.

But Senate'majority leaders see in the
Pitt situation a juicy cause-celebre which
can result in the Democratic House passing
the Senate’s bloc appropriations bill.

The House has passed the Pitt bill, low-
ering tuition to $450 for all Pennsylvania
students. The Senate must act to finalize
the legislation. Scranton has agreed to sign
the Pitt bill, even though it is non-preferred
legislation.

Suddenly the Republican Senate leaders

- have become imbued with an insatiable de-

sire to live by the letter of the State Con-

Q;/imstittrtion. They insist it would be “good

business” to pass the general appropria-
tions bill first. According to their loose in-
terpretations of the laws of the state, gen-
eral operations must take precedent over

 other matters in the legislature. '

"\.

The fact of the matter is’ that the Sen-
ate has already passed two non-preferred
appropriations—one for Penn State and the
other for Moore College. They weren't so
concerned about the Constitution then,

mainly because they weren't deeply em-s
broiled in a battle with the House over the if

 of appropriations.

End Indoctrination

As pressure for the passage of Pitt leg-
islation continues to build, the Senate fig-
ures the House will be under even more
pressure to take the Senate general appro-
piations bill out of committee and adopt it.-

Only concerned with their petty polit-
ical machinations, the Republican Senate
leaders have throwna flimsy veil over the
Pitt crisis. The citizens of Pennsylvania
should carefully scrutinize the legislators
who have cast this veil and should seriously .
reconsider their worth as leaders in the
General Assembly. At this hour, had the
Republican leadership committee not balked
Governor Scranton, Pitt could be a state-
‘related institution. The fears of countless
parents and students could be assuaged and
Pitt administrative operations could begin

’ to roll.

In the midst of this mess, Pitt should
not forget the friends fighting our cause.
Deserving the ‘highest praise is the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette and its courageous, cru-
sading Harrisbug correspondent Frank
Matthews. Matthews has exposed the Har-
risburg sham for what it is and deserves
national recognition .for his excellent re-
porting. ’

We have our friends, but mark well the
wrencli in the works. These are your legis-
lators, your representatives who are strang-
ling your University. Let them know you
want immediate action upon their return to
Harrisburg. Your University has become a

‘political football. Continued pressure via

telegraph, letter or petition can stop this
game NOW. '

ROTC In Perspective

By Frank Cowuares

The administration's justiﬁca;
tion for this procedure is’ that
“The Government asks us to do
it.” However, without discussing
the, wisdom of encouraging mili-
tary training in any university,
or of the presentation of ROTC
‘as an alternative to physical edu-
cation (subjects which 'must be
‘broached in the future),.a valid
discussion of alternative recruit-
ment polices for ROTC can be
initi'ated. The suggestion has been
put forward by certain Pitt stu-
dents that ROTC be eliminated
from the orientation program.
The example of other institutions
Of higher learning should be
adopted. ROTC should be pre-
sented, along with all other or-

ganiaztions and activities which
are realistically “extra-curricu-
lar of university study.

THIS PLAN though not fully
Sati5faCt0I‘Y. can serve: to put
ROTC in its Proper perspective
and remove'it from the superior
position of advantage and priv-
ilege on this campus. Eventually,

Editor, The Pitt News:
When my mother attended the

University of Pittsburgh Chancel- .

lor Bowman had hopes of build-
ing the Cathedral. He unfortun-
ately ran into trouble which is
another story. The point is the
Cathedral was\ built with the
help of the community, my moth-
er bought a brick in the Cathe-
dral, school children, did also,
and monies were contributed by
philanthropic interests such as
the Mellons and the Scaifes.

The University is now facing
a period of ﬁnancial indecision
and there seems to be little or
no community support, student
support or philanthropic inter-
ests. ’ '

I would pose the question: Is

state relationship the only an- .

swer? This is a Pittsburgh uni-
versity before it is a state univer-

sity. The University has brought .

much academic honor to the city
and has played a large and im-
portant part in the beautiﬁcation
and renewal of Oakland as a
cultural, academic and entertain-
ment center. Where is the city
now? What role is she playing
in the University plight? What is
her interest in the University
that has given so much to the
city.

Question — Chancellor Kurtz-
man did you try all the avenues
open to you before running to

the state for aid? Are you a

Chancellor or the organizer and '

holder of a bankruptcy sale?

Questionéwhy did the legisla-
tors vacate now when the stu-
dent body needs to be educated?

I have heard much talk about
the hope of a state and the na-
tion being in its youth. You state
legislators are shaking that hope
through indecision and vacilla-
tion. The onus rests on your
shoulders. V

Question—To the philanthropic
resources of Pittsburgh. Why buy

The graduate schools are impor-
tant but the foundation "of any

university is the undergraduate .

student body and faculty. This is
the most important and impres-
sionable segment of the Univer-
sity. It should be emphasized that
this is the underpinning of the
University.

Question —‘ Why is there so

. much student apathy? This is our

University. Do you see it in the
semi-ivy league image had by
Chancellor Litchﬁeld or do you
visualize it as a beautiful physi-
cal plant operating as a regional
indistinguishable nonentity? Part
of the problem lies with you the
student body. When was the last
time you made a new acquain-
tance on campus, meet a dorm

student, a commuter student, ex- _

change student? This is our Uni-
versity—-support it. :'
