Program», Pitt is one of only
nine offering health physics fel-
lowships. . Pitt has been
1 involved in previous health
physics fellowship programs
funded by the U.S. Public
Health Service, the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Atomic
Energy Commission. The Pitt
~health physics program dates
back to the l950’s “about as
long as any school of public
healthin the country has had a
program," Wal_d said.
L» ' here will be 24 fellowships

year, consisting of tuition costs
and a stipend of $1,000 each
month or $ 12,000 per year. Each
student will be expected to com-
plete a three-month practicum
at one of the DOE laboratories,
during which they will receive
an additional $200 per month
plus travel expenses. Students
will also be expected to

seriously consider employment
with the DOE or one of its con-
tractors upon completion of
their academic programs.

Milani, associate director of Stu-
dent Activities. 1

Last year it developed the Stu- P‘

dent Development Transcript, an
official record of the extra-
curricular activities and accom-
plishments of undergraduate stu-
‘dents. Official copies of .the
transcripts aregused to accompany
resumes and academic transcripts
for applications to graduate
schools and prospective employers.
The transcript is divided into
four sections: leadership activities,
professional or educational devel-
opment, honors, awards and recog-
nition, and participation.
Leadership activities include any‘
leadership role in any organiza-
tion, activity or program.. Profes-
sional or educational development

includes "participation in any
extr’a-curricular learning expe-
rience such as workships, seminars
or conferences. Honors, awards
and recognition include any type
of formal recognition given, to a
student individually or as part of a
group. Participation includes
membership in any organization,
activity or program that requires
sustained participation.

Upon completion of any activ-
ity, the student completes an activ-
ity record validated by a
non-student official or representa-
tive directly associated with the
activity, according to Milani.

Generally, the transcript is rep-
roduced the term prior to gradua-
tion, but if a "copy is needed at an
earlier date,.a request can be sub-
mitted at any time. 'After gradua-
‘tion, records are kept in the compu-
ter file for one year and in hard

-copy for two years. ..

According to Milani, “the Stu-
dent Development Transcript is an
enhancement to an academic trans-
cript because activities outside of

ing experience.”

will also utilize its‘ computer sys-

.tem for the COMCAP Program, a

carpool system developed by the
Student Government Board Com-'
muter Affairs Committee.

This committee is designed to
define and’ deal with some of the
problems encountered by the com-
muting student, Milani said. The
four main areas dealt with are mass
transit, driving and parking,
improving services and -facilities,
and programming.

Designed by Peter Karlovich, -the
COMCAP Program operated suc-
cessfully last year,- but will be
assisted in the future by the Off-

ing to Milani.

Another project sponsored by
the Office of Student Activities as a
result of the computer system is the
Freshman Interest Survey,
designed to aid the recruitment

efforts of recognized student

groups and to facilitate the assimi-
lation of freshmen into extra-
curricular activities, Milani said.

F onerSa ys Education Improves

By MATT HAWKINS

Few people are in a position to
make a comparison between the
academic structures of the United
States, the People’s Republic of
China, the Soviet Union and Cuba,
but'Dr. Philip Foner is such _aper-
son as he has had first hand expe-
rience teaching at universities in
all of those countries and others.

Foner, who has written numer-

‘ ous volumes on United States and

Cuban history and has edited the
works of Thomas Paine, Frederick
Douglass, Jose Marti and many
others, gave a series of lectures in

. Pittsburgh from June 15 through

June 18. His lectures focused on his

‘recent trips to Cuba and China,

and his experiences there.
Between speaking engagements,
Foner was available for consulta-
,tion. . _
His impression of the academic

- systemin China was that it is now

in the process of recovering from
the “excesses” of their cultural
revolution. _

“The cultural revolution has

, \resulted in a great deal of cynicism

among young people, especially in
the universities,. towards the ideas
of socialism and Marxism-
Leninism,” he said. “The universi-
ties were really shattered during the
cultural revolution. Most of them

_were closed down, the scholars
were removed. Those who were not
removed were not allowed to do
any work. China literally lost con-
tact with all the work being done in
(various) fields during those
years.”

During this period, the Chinese
government released statements
explaining that the cultural revo-
lution was meant to change the
consciousness of the Chinese peo-
ple so they would become more

/

“self-sacrificing for the social
good” and to “renew the Chinese
society and culture along proletar-
ian lines,” Foner said.

Now the Chinese government has
some regrets about the whole expe-
rience, he added. ‘

According to Dr. Foner, the Chi-
nese account of the cultural revolu-
tion is that “in the beginning, there
was undoubtedly some justifica-
tion for some of the criticism of the
intellectuals for too much elitism
and for being removed from the
people, but the thing got so com-
pletely out of hand that all interest
in anything of value culturally,
scientifically or academically was
absolutely destroyed. ’.’

Foner’s lectures in China were a

“part of a process of scholarly

‘exchange between the United
States and China.
He said, “the relationship with
the United States has been grow-
ing. One of the consequences of
this relationship between the Uni-
ted States and China has been that
there is a flow back and forth.
Quite a number of academics are
coming to American universities to

study in their disciplines and quite,

a number of American academics
are coming to China to teach as
foreign experts.”

According to Foner, this process

of scholarly exchange has not

always gone smoothly. ,

“There was a feeling, as it was
explained to me in China, that
quite a number of the American

scholars who were coming to.

China were hostile to the Chinese
society in terms of its social out-
look. They were having some

' influence on the studentswho were

already growing in cynicism
because of the cultural
revolution.” ,

If Foner found the efforts of the
Chinese to overcome the mistakes

of the cultural revolution admira-
ble, he found the Cuban education
system impressive.

“Cuba simply wiped out illiter-
acy,” he said. “Youngipeople went
from Havana into the countryside
with the famous lanterns that they
carried, and taught the peasants
how to read and write. That is
acknowledged to have been the
most successful literacy campaign
in modern times. It became a model
for what is taking place in Nicara-
gua today. There is no illiteracy
problem in Cuba today, it has been
finished, wiped out. It is the only
country in Latin America where
you can say that's the case."

Foner said that he found the
University of Havana to be “a very
rich environment in which to
teach.” He said that the schools in
Cuba are racially integrated and
that their education system is
“widespread" because it is free of
cost from nursery school to the uni-
versity level.

He also pointed out that educa-
tional supplies, such as books, are
free.

He said the living standard in
Cuba is not quite the same as U.S.
citizens often picture it.

“There were times when (food
shortage) was a problem but not
any longer: the situation has
improved considerably especially
in the last few years.”

Foner explained the economic
system in Cuba plays a large part in
improving lifestyles there. L

“There are two markets in Cuba.
One is the regular market where
people buy -things with ration
books and cards. This limits the
amount of material you can have.

‘Prices are low in this market.

“One of the advantages of it is
that nobody can get too much of
the material because everyone hasa_
similar amount of ration tickets. I

'“They have also developed what
is called a ‘free market’ where
far-mers bring goods such as vegeta-
bles, meat, chickens, turkeys and
citrus crops, and people can buy
any amount they want to.

“There is no rationing, but, of
course, the prices are much higher
in this market. However, unless
they get too high, that isn’t a big
problem in'Cuba. Generally, the
amount of money that people have
is quite adequate for their needs.”

According to Foner, Cubans are
able to buy more because family
incomes are increasing.

“Many families have more than
one person working. You have
two-income families” he pointed
out. This, he said, was the result of
granting women ‘equal rights fol-
lowing the Cuba revolution.

Another factor in reducing fam-
ily expenditures, according to
Foner, is the fact that many
workers are provided with their
main meal at the place where they
work.

“I w/ould say that economically,
conditions have changed for the
better in Cuba. Of course in other
ways Cuba is far ahead of other
Latin American countries. .

: “Medical attention is very well
developed in Cuba. They lost a lot

Eof doctors as a result of the exodus
of doctors with the revolution.

They haveimore than made up that
loss—in fact they have so many
doctors now that they are export-
ing them to the rest of the third
world.” ,

He found the. medical facilities
to be in good shape and very access-
ible to the people on the island.

“Clinics, hospitals...all medical
attention is free. Drugs are free,” he
said. “I would say, and it is gener-
ally acknowledged, that from the
standpoint of education and
health, Cuba is ahead of nearly all
Latin American countries.
course you have to remember that
this is taking place in the face of an
economic blockade by the United
States.”

Foner believes that normalized
trade would be mutually beneficial
for both the United States and

\

INVENTORY———-July 1st and 2nd

Of -»

or:-:ioi:==o=o%oi:=o

Cuba, particularly Cuba.
“If the United States would only
have normal relations with Cuba

“and trade with Cuba as it does with

other countries, the situation there
would be even better," he said.
ulnstead of being requiredxﬁ
things eight or six thousand mi es
away, which is expensive, you »
could buy (products) from 90 miles
away as Cuba did before the
revolution.” -
He pointed out that there are
some similarities between the Chi-
nese and the Cuban economic sys-

tems, even though the scale is no

different. i

“There are two types of markets
in China, as there are in Cuba, the
state market and the freemarket. In
China, the free farmers, even under
communism, are allowed ‘certain
individual land of their own w I
they can produce and bringgoo
to the free market}:

Foner was interested in how the
average Chinese citizen lived.

“Every city that I had gone to, I
went into the marketplace and the
department‘ stores; I was favorably
impressed by the amount of goods
that are available, the number of
people who arebuying them, and,
judging from what I was able to
check, reasonable prices. Of course
the wages are very, very low, but the
prices are also quite reasonable in
terms of what the wages are,” he
said. “The other thing that
impressed me was that clothing
seemed to be quite good in 
and plentiful. You don't see people
in rags, you see people fairly well-

dresse 

Foner pointed out that “trans-
portation is’-a ‘big problem in
China. There are so many people,

. that at times, the buses take so long

to get to places—with the bicycles
and everything in the way—that it
is quite a problem.

“Housing in China is in very bad
shape,” he said. “They are trying to
overcome it, but it is a tough prob-
lem because they have so many
people. Most people only have two
rooms in spite of the size of the
family.”

Cate .Van Meter of the Pennsyl-
vania Campaign for a Nuclear
Weapons Freeze spoke of recent
legislation concerning a halt to the
nuclear arms race yesterday in the
Cathedral of Learning. .

“Some people really hope that a

-- big government is taking care of

them. They aren’t; they are going
to blow us up,” Van Meter said.
She said each one of us has a
responsibility in stopping the esca-
lation of the arms race.
 “he United States Senate For-
‘gn Relations Committee recently
withdrew a resolution which sup-
ports a nuclear weapons freeze and,
in Pennsylvania, efforts to have a
referendum concerning a nuclear
weapons freeze on the November

ballot havealso failed.

Present legislation includes a
joint resolution in the House of
Representatives calling for a com-
plete halt to the nuclear arms race.

Van Meter said the movement in
Pittsburgh for a nuclear arms freeze
has just begun, and at a national
level, thefreeze campaign is more
responsible.

Van Meter’s statements were
made at a meeting of Pittsburgh’s
Arms Race Study Group.

‘Also discussed were the verifica-
tion of compliance with nuclear
arms treaties and the role of arms
manufacturers such as Rockwell
International, General Electric,
and United Technologies in affect-
ing nuclear arms treaties 7

remarked how sensitive the verifi-
cation issue is.

“It’s easier to cheat on a cruise
missile than on an MX,” she said,
commenting on the capacity to
shuttle cruise missiles.

Such verification could only be
made knowing the number and
loading ‘capacity of launching
systems. —

Van Meter said present legisla-
tion dealing with these issues is
important since “what we’ve got is
a foreign policy that supports the
arms race. _ ‘

“It’s not really a partisan issue
since area congressmen are not
divided on the issue along party
lines.”

" udes; frisbees, suntan lotion
and the theater. Sound impossible?
Most‘ theaters in the Pittsburgh
area offer discounts on tickets for
students throughout the year.
The Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre, located at 420 North Craig
St., gives students a $1 discount on
any night except Saturday with
valid student identification.
Students can make reservations
or buy their tickets at the door.
“What the Butler Saw,” by Joe
Orton, opens July 9 and runs
through Aug. 7. Thesecond show

Theatre is not the only place where
students can receive discounts on
tickets. The Pittsburgh Playhouse,
which houses The Playhouse Jun-
ior, The American Dance Ensem-
The Point Park College
Theater Company and the Play-
house Theater Company, also
offers lower prices to college
students.

At the Playhouse, all student ~

tickets are $2.50 with identifica-
tion. Students can not make reser-
vations in advance and will not
receive the discount if they attend a -
Friday or Saturday evening
performance. J J
t . regular price for tickets at
the Playhouse ranges from $3.50 at
the Playhouse Junior to $9 for the '
most expensive seats at produc-
tions by the American Dance
Ensemble and the Playhouse.
Located at 222 Craft Ave. in Oak-

land, the Playhouse is within walk- 3
\ ing distance of Pitt, CMU and

Duquesne students.
The Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival, which is going on at the

Stephen Foster Memorial, also‘

offers a discount for students and
senior citizens. The festival is co-

The festival has a rush policy
which will last for the duration of
the season._If a student or senior
citizen, with valid identification
arrives 15 minutes before curtain
time, they may purchase a ticket for
$4. The regular prices range from
$5 to $8.

“Hamlet,” which is currently

. playing, runs until July 3; curtain

times are at 8 p.m., ‘Tuesday

through Sunday, with a 2 p.m.

matinee on Sunday. Following
“Hamlet" is “The Merry Wives of

Jargon Needed

For Education

(‘onI1'nm’d from one

cation is more difficult to achieve
than it was ten years ago, five years
ago, even one year ago.”

Spriestersbach believes the
major reason for this is that the
particular vocabulary of higher
education, jargon, is undergoing a
period of rapid change. “The jar-
gon of the academy is swiftly mov-

, ing out of existence. Some words

that we‘ used for centuries within
the community of scholars are
gone. Many that had one meaning
for generations now have another.
Moreover, an entirely new, more
secular vocabulary is ‘now engag-
ing the higher education commun-
ity to displace our traditional
vocabulary,” Spriestersbach
continued.

Some communications theorists
say that anythingiman can think of
can be expressed in words. If what
Ralph Waldo Emerson believed
and what these theorists say is true,
then the revolution in higher edu-
cation has taken place, Spriestersb-_
ach said.

2 According to Spriestersbach,
concessions in the words of higher
communication were not of little
consequence. The community of

scholars became the victims of this
new vocabulary, Spriestersbach
added. “This new vocabulary of
higher education soon became part
of a jargon, and this was the first

step in the institutionalism of,

higher education.”

Spriestersbach told the audience
of a proposal he receiyed from a
national organization in higher
education. In the 30-page prop-
osal, not once did there appear the

' words “scholarship,” ‘‘research,’’

7! 1:

‘‘faculty,‘‘ “professor, student”

or “study,” he said. “The proposal _

was communicating in words con-
stituting a consistent, self-
contained 'vocabulary—the jargon
of the institute. ‘Student’ became
‘trainee,’ ‘study’ became ‘training,’
‘course work’ became ‘credit,’ and
"research’ ' bec_ame ‘extra-
institutional experience.’

“But even if themeaning of the

words in the old academic jargon ‘

are irretrievable, one thing is cer-
tain: if we carry on the advance-
ment of knowledge, fight for the
privilege and immunities of the
scholar, make our degrees express

the attainment of thelove of wis-_',

dom,_ we will create a new vocabu-
lary for the -academy,” he
concluded.

and a special General Assembly of
the United Nations, people of the
world have joined in a common
cause—protecting the world from
destruction by nuclear weaponry.
However, in another nuclear matter,
the nuclear energy controversy, the
country isn't quite so uniﬁed. ls
nuclear power a safe energy
source?

Ranging from the radical no-
nukers who fear for the future of
humanity to the scientists and engi-
neers who maintain nuclear power is
the only practical energy source for
the coming years, some people take
a firm stand on the issue. Whether
guided by pragmatism or emotion,
most stand unshakably on either the
"pro-nuclear" or “anti-nuclear" side.

“I don't know what's ‘pro-
nuclearf" said physics Professor Ber-
nard Cohen. "I just tell facts the way
they are. Health effects of radiation is
a scientific question—-not a political
question or anything else. A scientiﬁc
question isn't something you have
the right to an opinion on."

A Cohen believes nuclear power is

safer than the source form which

most people currently receive their
energy—coal—and has completed
many studies confirming this.

In an article concerning the health
risks of nuclear waste and waste
from a coal-fired plant is the radioac-
tivity present in the nuclear waste. He
maintains that the radiation emitted
from radioactive waste is neither as
mysterious nor as dangerous as the
public is led to believe.

“Radioactivity can be dangerous
in large quantities," Cohen wrote,
“but prcibably the main reason for
the emotional reaction to the danger
is the lO0,000-plus fatalities caused
by the atomic bombs dropped on
Japan during World War ll. Blaming
radioactivity for these deaths is
unjustiﬁed: the great majority of

. these deaths were caused by blast,

heat and ﬁre having nothing to do
with radiation. Perhaps 20 percent
were due to direct radiation from the
bomb, but none were caused by the
remnant radioactivity, which is the
only source of potential danger from

nuclear wastes. in fact, no trace of
radioactivity from the bombs was
ever found in Hiroshima or
Nagasaki."

The problem of dealing with
radioactive nuclear waste has
already been solved by scientists,
Cohen maintained.

“We're going to convert (nuclear
wastes) into rocks and put it where
the natural rocks are—deep under-
ground," Cohen wrote. “How do we
know this will be safe? Because we
know a great deal about how rocks
behave, and if the rocks into which
the waste has been converted
behave as expected, it will be ex-
tremely safe." '

In an article addressing the threat
of a nuclear reactor core melt-down,
Cohen writes that the possibility of
such an occurrence is slim, and if it
did happen, it would not be as harm-
ful for the public as is widely believed.

According to estimates by govern-
ment scientists, for nuclear power it;
be as dangerous as coal,  wouid
have to experience a reactor melt- \

down every two weeks somewhere in
the United States," he wrote. “An
average melt-down, according to
government estimates, would result
in about 400 eventual cancers.... But
air pollution from coal-burning is
generally estimated to be causing
about 1 0,000 fatalities per year in the
United States, a rate of 400 every two
weeks."

He said only one in 100,000 melt-
downs like that which was feared in
the Three Mile lsland incident could
lead to  deaths.”

He believes that the media, ill-
informed and more concerned with
sensationalizing the situation than
putting it in proper perspective, are
responsible for the ignorance and
fear of the American public regard-
ing nuclear energy.

“As a result.of the fear spread by

the media," Cohen writes, "the Uni-
ted States is abandoning nuclear
power. We are thus being deprived of
our cheapest and safest form of
energy at a time when we desperately
need it."

John McAdoo, assistant manager
of the Nuclear Safety Department in
the Nuclear Technology Division of
Westinghouse believes the question
is not whether nuclear power is safe,
but whether it is safe enough.

McAdoo's reply is "yes."

“That's the question people have
to come to terms with," he said.
“Things are never totally safe or
totally unsafe. There is always a ques-
tion of degree that has to be
answered.”

McAdoo said that Westinghouse
is working on “risk analysis," which
he deﬁnes as “a way of coping with

things that are normally very hard to
deal with—the question of how safe
is safe enough. the problem we have
faced over the years is whenever we
build something new, someone new,
says, ‘That's not safe enough. We
want it shut down."'

He does not believe the radiation
emitted from nuclear waste is of
much danger to the public.

"One of the reassuring things
about radiation is that it's one of the
most measurable things that we
have," he said. "We can measure it
many levels below that where there
are any biological effects. It seems
extremely unlikely that there could
be any sufﬁcient amount of radiation
coming out and causing any kind of

a health hazard."

Also unlikely, according to McA-
doc, is the possibility of a nuclear
melt-down.

“When we design a nuclear power
plant, one of the main objectives is to
make the possibility of a'melt-down
as slim as we can. Theresa tremend-
ous amount of energy that goes into
making them safe. None of the reac-

tors have come close to melting.
-down, despite all of the hoopla

caused by Three Mile Island.

The safety goal of the Nuclear Reg-
ulatory Commission, McAdoo said,
is to lessen the probability of a core
melt-down.

Dr. Earl Gulbransen, scientist and
consultant with Westinghouse,
believes the possibility of a nuclear
melt-down is greater than govern-
ment estimates show. _

bransen, one serious accident has

Island. 

“They were way off," he said. “One
accident happened right away and it
could happen again anytime."

Gulbransen believes the problem
with nuclear energy is that it utilizes
the wrong materials, namely zirco-
nium. Zirconium, he said. reacts not
only with oxygen, nitrogen and car-
bon dioxide, but also with other
materials, such as steel.

"It's too reactive. if it's not kept
cool or if there's an accident and you
lose the water... you can reach a
temperature where zirconium can be
released into the room and outside.

Unless you keep it cool, you hag"

problems. ,

“it happened at Three Mile Island.
It melted and a lot of radiation got
(outside). Fortunately, it was anew
reactor and the ﬁssion products had
not built up to. a very high level.''

If the reactor had been a few years
older, Gulbransen said, the accident
could have been more serious.

“Nobody will know for several
years, until they get their data in, how
bad (Three Mile Island) really was.
There was an appreciable -amount of
radiation that got out, but they don't
want that released until it all blows
over."

Radioactive waste is yet another
problem with nuclear energy,
said. “There's no place to put it." '

Turning it into rock is one sugges-
tion currently being investigated. At
present the waste is being put next to
the plants, under 20 feet of water.
The escaping radiation is the source
of high infant mortality and cancer
rates near the plants, according to
Gulbranseh.

“All of these reactors leak, and it
gets into the atmosphere," he said.
“The strontium-90 gets in the atmos-
phere and in the grass: the cows eat
the grass. It also gets in the milkk
we're drinking.

"These reactors are very danger-
ous, and people are not trained to
recognize what are the best things to
do. That is the real problem-you

can't really anticipate what is going 

go wrong and what" you're going to
do." ‘

Tom Gordon, a Harvard University
seniou who has been involved in var-
ious anti-nuclear protests, believes
nuclear energy is unsafe and will

remain unsafe for quite a while.

“Mainly," Gordon said, “the scient-
ists and technicians don't have the
incentive to keep if safe; they're being
paid almost invariably by people
whose interest is to make nuclear
power proﬁtable rather than safe.
(This is) bound to be true to a greater
or lesser extent."

Gordon tends to be skeptical of
scientists and capitalists in general,

- especially when they work tog%m‘,

as he believes is the case *
nuclear power. He also includes the
nuclear regulatory agencies as being

‘among those whose primary con-
cern is proﬁt, not safety.

“it's not both effective and unbi-
ased," he said “They're going to be
inﬂuenced by the nuclear power
companies. There’ve simply been
too many nuclear accidents lately.

“Secondly, there hasn't been suffi-
cient time to experiment to ﬁnd out
how to make a safe nuclear power
plant. The only way to do it is to make
guinea pigs out of the people living
around (them) and I don't think that's
acceptable."

Gordon believes nuclear waste“
and radiation leaks are panicularéﬁﬁ

hazardous, and said it is“unrealistic"
to expect that the safest means of
disposing nuclear waste will be
utilized.

“I don’t think anyone can deny that
radioactive waste, when not properly
disposed of, will cause damage to life
in general. .

“The damage is very long-term.
and (they) don't quite know what it's
going to cause. They're taking a
gamble of unknown odds."

Whether the odds are in the favor
of health and safety, people will con-
tinue to be divided on the issue of the
safety of nuclear power. Althotgg
some believe their stand is the c”.
rect one, no one knows for sure, and
nuclear power plants will continue to
olperate across the country despite it
a . .

By ADAM EISENSTAT

“ial science at sea? Liberal arts
at low tide? Sounds like...classes on
the high seas.

That’s just what itwas for 10 Pm
students and five faculty members
who, along with 420 students from
all over the world, participated in
the Semester at Sea (S.A.S.) floating
classroom.

The three month journey
(March 4-June 13) was designed to
give students an opportunity to
explore different countries around
the world while taking university
approved classes on board the S.S.
Universe, according to the dean of

S ecently completed voyage, Pitt
-professor of geology and planetary
sciences Norman Flint.

The S.S. ‘Universe spent an aver-
age of four days in II countries,
some of which included Korea,
India, Egypt and Sri Lanka. All
totalled 55 days were spent at Sea
and 44 in various countries.

The most unique feature of the

stops was the “academic practica,"
Flint noted. He described this as an
arranged visit to someplace that
corresponded with a class being‘
taught on board. For example, he
said, a business class might tour a
factory or a sociology class might
visit a remote village.
‘here were also optional pay
trips on whichstudents could fly to
a neighboring country and stay for
a few days. The pay trip to
Shanghai, China was a particu-
larly popular one, he said.

The students had 62 classes from
which to choose, mostly in the
humanities and social sciences.
The courses offered were similar to
those offered at universities. Flint
was responsible for insuring that
the curriculum measured up to
“Pitt’s normally high” standards.
He also taught a geology class.

Along with Flint, four other Pitt
faculty members participated in
the S.A.S. program: Richard Yang,
professor of East Asian studies;

ﬁseph Pois, professor of political
» ‘ience; Darrell Posey, professor of

anthropology; and Ken Gargaro,
professor of theater arts. In addi-
tion, 17 professors from 15 other
schools were present.

The S.A.S. program is in its
second vear under the auspices of

  Semester At Sea Returns

Pitt in conjunction with the Insti-
tute for Shipboard Iiducation.

Prior to last year. however, the
program was administered by the
University of Colorado, but inter-
nal problems forced it to cede the
program to another school.

In late 1980, Pitt chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar expressed an interest in
the program, but its implementa-
tion was not without controversy.

Several Pitt faculty members
were quite outspoken about their
dissatisfaction with the 

- program.

One of the major reservations of
the program's critics conrerned
course accreditation. Some were
also unhappy about the fact that
Posvar initiated Pitt's acquisition
of the program without first con-
sulting the" faculty.

Perhaps the S.A.S. program’s
strongest critic ‘was political
science professor Richard Cottam.

He too saw the voyage as a pleas-
ure-filled retreat from academia.

In 198], immediately before the

first voyage, he said: “The S.A.S.

program is not the kind of thing
that adds to the university’s image
as a serious international institu-
t1on.”

What then is the S.A.S.? A party
liner with some courses thrown in
for show? Is it an ethnocentric
excursion into the “third world”?

According to Flint, these are
“misconceptions.”

“It's up to the students to disci-
pline themselves. They will social-
ize to excess if they want to,
whether they're on a ship or at

home. The only difference on the

ship is that everything is so close
together.

This small,close-knit commun-
ity actually has some advantages
over a conventional college atmos-
phere, Flint said. Professors are
seen not only during class, but are
an integral part of the shipboard
community. They're always
available.

The main advantage of such an
educational setting, according to
Flint, is that it gives the participant
a first-hand look at some of the cul-
tures being studied in class, or
those cultures about which he is
curious.

“It's not something you can
learn from a book,”Bonnie Stone

said, a Pitt student who went on
this year’s voyage. “I saw how the
other half lives. I never knew pov-
erty like that existed, but you can’t
doubt it when it’s right there in
front of your eyes."

When asked whether or not he

noticed any changes in the stu- -

ticnt’s conception of the world,
Flint said, ‘‘I doubt anyone, faculty
II1( luded, came back from the trip
without a better tolerance for for-
eigiiers. I was very impressed by
our students who wanted to get out
and talk to the people.”

Students who participated in the
recently completed voyage also had
an opportunity to gain new cultu-
ral exposure on board the ship.
There were several students from

all over the world, including
China, Brazil, Italy, and
Argentina.

A trip like the S.A.S. provides
endless opportunities for one to
have a very good time, according to
Stone. Every new port is :3 sojourn
into the unexpected, she said.
Sometimes the comic or absurd
occurs. Stone recalled how a one-
hour camel ride turned into a four-
hour. excursion."They just didn’t
want to take us back.” ..

She also recalled how the people
they encountered were sometimes
awestruck‘ at the sight of
Americans. -

,“Many times they would come
up and touch us or try out their
ultra-formal English on us.

“A couple of times we would
supposedly be taken on a sightsee-
ing tour and end up at someones
house for dinner—or somewhere
we didn’t want to go.

“And. of course, they tried to sell
us stuff we had no use for. We had
mishaps in every country, but now
it's easy to laugh about ,” Stone
said.

Whether it's exposing Ameri-

cans to the squalor of Bombay or p

the majesty of the "Egyptian pyra-
mids, its difficult to asess the true
value of the S.A.S. experience.

"It's the chance of a lifetime for
any student. It's unequaled,"Flint
said. ’

“I’d urge anybody to go. If inte-
racting with different cultures
sounds appealing, get on board,”
Stone said.

Opinion

i Which
Will
Work?

It is worthy of note that Pitt administra-
tor’s focused on public perception of the
university during its recent “mini-think-
tank” at the Johnstown branch campus.

Actually, the solutions proposed for
Pitt’s image problem were even more
interesting. i i

The panel of administrators and faculty
members that discussed the external percep-
tion of the university concluded that beef-
ing up public relations will give Pitt a nice
ego boost. ‘

It’s certainly true that meritorious acts
deserve notice. It also can be argued that
campus media sometimes _don’t do their
jobs adequately: i.e., lack of coverage for the
debate team’s national championship, or
various groups who raise money for
charity. J _

It is also true, however, that a hard-sell

_ public relations campaign won’t even solve

the difficulties that cause Pitt’s image prob-
lem in the first place.

Perhaps substantive methods of dealing
with public perception isto be accomp-
lished first, with bows to follow.

We suggest the following would do a bet-
ter job of _creating a feeling of good will
toward Pitt:

0 Since they paid for it, grantstudents the
use, now and then, of some of the fancy
rooms soon to be built in the Student
Union, before they are rented out for wed-
ding receptions and Shriner’s banquets;

0 Take_ some of the revenue raised by the
new stadium football lights to finance sev-
eral advising positions, thereby reassuring
several hundred students who need advice
on how to spend the rest of their lives;

0 Give academic departments about to

get the axe at least a few years warning so

their students can transfer.

If these requests can be_met, we’d be more
than happy to hear about it.

lice Incident‘strange”’

Dear. lidi tor:

Recently I had an incident with a
Pitt Campus policeman which
made me wonder about the caliber
of personnel the Pitt Campus
Police employs. (I had heard
numerous stories about the Pitt
Campus Police and how their con-
duct leaves something to be
desired. I also recall reading in the
Pittsburgh newspapers a couple of
years or so ago that a state court

V judge had referred to the Pitt Cam-

pus Police as a bunch of “Keystone
Kops.”)

Recently I had an appointment
with a professor in the Cathedral of
Learning. The appointment was
for l p.m. At about 12:55, Iheaded
into the Cathedralof Learning. As
I was going down the sidewalk, I

i noticed a short, odd-looking catn-
pus policeman slouched -against or
leaning_ against a yellow and
orange emergency call box by the
sidewalk.

He had a strange, distorted look
on his face, as if he were upset, in
pain or disoriented. Iiwent inside
the ground floor and dropped a let-
ter into one of the mail boxes past
the elevators; when I turned to take
an elevator to make my appoint-
ment, I was confronted by this
strange campus policeman, who
had followed me inside.

For no apparent reason, he inter-
rogated me concerning who I was,
why I was there, who the professor
was that I was going to see and
what the appointment was about.
And when I finally satisfied him
that I was in the Cathedral of
Learning for a legitimate purpose,
he said contemptuously, “Don't go
wandering around.” It was an
incongruous remark for him to
make since I hadn’t been “wander-
ing around.”

When I related the incident to
the professor at our scheduled
appointment, I asked him if he
could see_ any reason in my manner
or dress that he thought would
make me the object of suspicion.
He said he didn't. ’

Then another professor came

‘ into the office, and I asked him too
if he could perceive anything about
me that he thought would attract
attention orrnake me "seem out of

P place in a university environment.
He said he didn’t. ldon’t doubt the
university's right to strict access to
its buildings, but I found the cam-
pus policeman’s conduct towards,
me unnecessarily interrogatory,
well beyond what was needed to
establish whether I was there on
legitimate business. Also I couldn't
understand why I had been singled
out for no reason. And I found the
crack about “wandering around”
‘ to have been uncalled for and

' insulting.

When I mentioned this incident
to my attorney, he suggested that,
in view of the reputation for rude-
ness that not only the campus

police but other University of Pitts- ,

burgh employees as well have, I
should complain. So I wrote a let-
ter of complaint to the Chancellor.
It was referred to the University’s
bureaucracy, and the explanation I
got back was that the campus
policeman “didn’t recognize me”
as a "regular visitor” to the Cathed-
ral of Learning.

I find this explanation ludicrous
since. it _would be impossible for
anyone. to know on sight all the

many persons who come there reg-
ularly. I’m sure that every week
hundreds of non-regular visitors
come through for legitimate rea-
sons. Is each one intensively inter-
rogated, and told not to go “wan-
dering around?” I find ridiculous
the image of this short campus
policeman slouched against a call
box with a strange expression on
his face as he scans the faces of
thousands of people on the'side-
walk everyday for those he doesn't
recognize and follows and interro-
gates those he doesn't know.

Nothing Hidden, Student
Health ServiceMaintains

Dear Editor:

After reading the editorial
“Communication Gap Exists”
that appeared in The Pitt News on
June 2, 1982, I felt ‘compelled to
correct the numerous errors in the
article. ,

First and foremost, the Student
Health Service has nothing to hide.
Whenever a new program or fee
increase, etc., is to be put into
effect, the Student Health Advisory
Board (S.H.A.B.) studies the new
program in detail to be sure that it
meets student's needs. Once
S.H.A.B.'s approval is given, then
the program can be instituted.

Second, the S.H.A.B. is deeply

‘involved with the budget process at

the Student Health Service. For the
past seven years, we have been an
essential asset to both the Student

ii Health Service and the students at

Pitt.

We reviewed the budget in detail
with the director of the Student
Health Service, Mr. Frank Carter;
at this meeting, it was quite
obvious that there had to be a hike
in the fee-—after all, the inflation of
medical care last year alone was
well above 20 percent.

Third, the Student Government
Board (S.G.B.) was well aware of
the Student Health Fee increase.
On March 3, 1982, an article
appeared in The Pitt News that
stated that the S.G.B. was well
aware of the health fee increase and
they were “working on a plan."

Furthermore, on two separate
occasions, Mr. Carter approached
the S.G.B. to tell them that he
would give a presentation of the
budget and proposed fee increase
and listen to the Board's critique at
their convenience. The S.G.B.
never took Mr. Carter up on the

offer; apparently the‘S.G.B._wasn’t
too concerned about the issue.

Fourth, the story about the sur-
vey is grossly inaccurate. One of
S.H.A.B.’s goals is to institute an
annual student survey concerning
the medical care given at the Stu-
dent Health Service. Noticing that
this was also a goal of SC‘ 
S.H.A.B. approached the Boar .5
ask if they would like to work with
S.H.A.B. to institute the survey.
S.G.B. declined _the offer, saying
that they wanted to develop their
own survey. The Student Health
Service had nothing to do with
S.G.B.’s survey.

I have two suggestions to make.
First, I think its about time that
student organizations work
together. Since S.H.A.B.’s purpose

‘is to monitor the care and services

provided by the Student Health
Service, obviously they are better
informed to make recommenda-
tions about the budget.

 

When, student organizatioﬁs
work together, I think we will fin "

that we can accomplish much more
more efficiently.

Second, The Pitt News should
get the facts straight before writing
venomous articles about university
administrators, especially when
the facts appear inprevious issues
of The Pitt News.

If anyone is suspicious about the
Student Health Service, by all
means contact S.H.A.B. via the
green complaint box in the Student
Health Service. Our studentorgan-
ization’s main purpose is to see that
students receive the medical _
they desire from the Stude 3
Health Service.

  Films And Concerts Highlight Summer Nights”

The Symphony
At.The-Point

Parks are normally” filled “with”

grass, trees and people, but this
summer some of them are also filled
with music. .

Every Thursday, Saturday and
Sunday at 7:30 p.m. from July 4
through July 31, the Pittsburgh
Symphony will perform free c_on—
certs at Point State Park.

For years, the symphony played
at Temple Music Festival just out-

0 side of Philadelphia during the.
- summer months.

“Apparently funds ran out, gmd

they couldn’t accomodate them any
longer,” said Linda Carducci, who '

works in the public relations depart-
ment at Heinz Hall.
Last year was the first year the
symphony played at the Point.
, According to Carducci, “They

Thbse seeking
summer heat, classes and boredom
can spend their evenings in the city
parks——watching films and listening
to area bands free of charge.

 Sponsored by the City of Pitts-
burgh Department of Parks and
Recreation, Cinema in the Parks
and Concerts in the Parks are free
to all who attend. From now until
Aug. 22, concerts and films will be
held in Riverview Park in the West
End, Highland Park in the city’s East
End, and on Flagstaff Hill in Oak-
land’s Shenley Park—the best loca-
tions in the city, according the
program coordinator“ of concerts
and films, Gary Kaboly.

“I just can’t go out anywhere and
show a movie,” Kaboly said. He
added that seating, lights and public

access, as well as electricity, are L

things he has to consider in choos-
ing sites for the concert .and film
programs.

‘‘I have to find a place where peo-
ple can sit on the grass and be com’-
fortable. l have to find a place that
has power; it can’t"have any lights
near it, and it also has to be safe and
accessible to people, not down deep
in the park someplace.” -

After years of experimentation
with different locations, Kaboly has
settled on Flagstaff Hill in Shenley
Park, Highland Park and Riverview
Park as the best sites the city has

A ‘available for cinema and concerts.

“There aren't too many of those
locations in the city, and these seem
to be the best I’ve found so far. Flag-
staff is perfect. You couldn’t ask for
anything more than that,” according
to Kaboly. -

When scheduling films, Kaboly
believes he generally aims for the
college crowd.

“From 20 years old to 30 to 40
years old. But we ‘get people of all

_ ages. The little kids and the old

, neoole.”‘

relief from ’

were without a summer home last

year, so we decided to bring them to _

the Point.”

Anyone who wants to bring a'
blanket or lawn chair or just sit on

the grass will enjoy some very spe-
cial concerts. \

“Two of the performances will be
pops-oriented,” said Carducci.

On July 4, Skitch Henderson will
be conducting the symphony. The
repertoire for that evening will fea-
ture patriotic songs to commemo-
rate lndependence Day.

Most people remember Mitch
Miller from his sing-along days on
television. July 18 will mark Miller's
appearance, conducting the sym-
phonyand leading the audience in
some songs.

Films scheduled for Flagstaff Hill
this summer include the 1956 origi-
nal film version of “Invasion of the
Body Snatchers,” the 1951 comedy,
“Bedtime for Bonzo” and “The
Howling,” a 1981 version of the wolf-

’ man movies.

Kaboly admits the Highland Park
and Riverview Park sites, with films
such as “The Absent Minded Pro-
fessor,” “Bluebird” and'“Star Trek:
The Motion Picture,” are geared
‘toward a different audience than the
-Flagstaff Hill site.

“At Flagstaff, the selection is a
little bit different. We show more
films there, because it’s such an
ideal location. Some of the titles are
more obscure than at Highland and
Riverview,”Kaboly said.

Attracting crowds to Hagstaff is
easier, according to Kaboly,

“Maxim Shostakovich, son of
composer Dmitri Shostakovich, will
be in Pittsburgh conducting on July
8 and 10,” said Carducci. -

because the films have been shown
there the longest. , _

“Whereas at Riverview and High-
land, we haven’t been there as long.
You have to attract a crowd there
throught the types of films (shown).

“I want to do that—(there are)
family neighborhoods out there.”

1 Cinema in the Parks began in
1978, when’ Kaboly first conceived
of and developed the idea. Five
years later, he said he wasn’t really
sure how he came up with it.

“It just popped into my head——
outdoor films. I started researching

it——what equipment we’d need, how’

much money it would run—and it
just evolved.”

Today Kaboly estimates that the
films draw good crowds——between
2,000 and 2,500 people for Flagstaff
and between 300 and 400 each at

. Gary Kabolyand  Mougianis operate a concert mixing board.

\

In bad weather, concerts will take
place if it’s not raining too hard, but
“if it’s a downpour, they'll be can-
celled,” Carducci said.

Funding for the outdoor concerts
is provided by the National Endow-
ment for the Arts, the Pennsylvania

Highland and Riverview Parks.
It s real cheap, too. lt’s only
about 18 cents a head,”he said.

Preceding each of the films is a
concert which four years ago were
not at all connected, according to
Kaboly. The move to join the two,
back-to-back, was one of economy
as well as convenience.

“Funding was being cut. We just
didn’t have enough people to do
concerts at one location and films at,
another. So we brought them both
together. We’re able to save money,
and it works out real well,” he
added.

While the bill for the films is paid
for by the City of Pittsburgh, funding
for the concerts-featuring such local
bands as Carsickness, Shadyside
Jazz, and the Pittsburgh Concert
Orchestra—is co-sponsored by the
Pittsburgh Musicians Union Local

Council on the Arts and the City of
Pittsburgh.

According to‘ Carducci, “even
though last year was the first year,
attendence was excellent.”

Carducci hopes even more peo-
ple will attend this year’s concerts.

J.S.

60-471 through the U.S. Recording
Companies Fund.

“It’s a trust fund. What happens is
that for every album sold, a couple
of pennies goes into the fund to sup-
port live music.” According to Kab-
oly, the ‘fund was created in
1938,when it was feared live music

would dissappear with the advent of

records.

‘ While he acknowledges th , he
films and concerts work will
together, Kaboly still believes it’s the
films that are the. real draw.

“Most people come out for the
movies. lt’s hard to stay in the park
for five hours on a weeknight.”

Finishing the Cinema in the
Park’s summer will be a Pie-in-the-
Eye Festival to be held on Sunday,
Aug. 22. Pittsburghers are invited to
come hear Billy Price and the Keys-
tone Rhythm Band, enjoy a bit of
pie-throwing fun» and watch the
film,‘ which Kaboly describes as
“snippets of all the pie-throwing
scenes in the movies.”

According to Kaboly,lthe festiv l‘

is a tradition-of-sorts with it ,-"’

Cinema in the Parks staff.

“At the end of every year, we try
to do something to celebrate the
end of summer. Last year, we had
the Tomato Mania Festival, and we
showed the film, “Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes.” We did every-
thing with tomatoes—we had
tomato judging and tomato soups
and dishes, tomato bobbing, tomato

‘races. It was lots of fun.”

This year, the festival plans to
focus itself on Pie-throwing, pie
judging, a competition for pie
comedia look-alikes, whit .
according to Kaboly, makes it
quite unique.

“I don’t think‘ they‘ do this any-
where else as well as we do it here,”

he said. , C.w;

Give them a noose, and they

Put him in an electric chair, and
they would hit the switch.

they hurl it at his body with a

And, if the local sports talk

‘hows are an accurate barometer,

their membership is increasing at a
faster rate than the Moose and Elks
combined.

A jury. What jury? Dave Parker
is facing a lynch mob.

A judge. No need for one now-—
Parker has already been sentenced.

The crime. Ah, a difficult ques-
tion to answer. -

Parker has won two National
League batting titles and as many
gold gloves for his defensive play.
He has driven in 100 runs in a sea-
son, has hit with above average
power and hasappeared in several
All-Star games.

Along with team captain Willie
Stargell, he led the Pirates to a tri-

i"umph over the Baltimore Orioles

in the 1979 World Series. Now,
after two consecutive off seasons,
the fans want to ship him out of
town. Oh, how soon they forget.

Parker has sacrificed his body for
this city, many times beyond the

call of duty. Countless times he has

raced. right smack into right field
wall,, trying to snatch a long fly
ball. So often he has dived headfirst
to the stone-like astroturf surface at
Three Rivers Stadium, lunging for
a short fly.

In the 1978 pennant race, as the
Pirates were making a hectic chase

‘ atthe division-leading Philadel-

hia Phillies, Parker suffered a

. actured cheekbone in a head-on

collision with an opposing
catcher.

‘ Darreliltiissendanner eould bringia cm to itsiieet with his lightening)-lilte

ﬂ'IOVOl'ﬂOl'ItS.

Sports   

Parker was out—both at the

plate and‘for what team doctors

termed “an indefinite period of
time”—probably the remainder of
the season, which was about two
months. . ‘

Aftfer just two weeks, Parker
questioned the doctors about the
risks involved in playing before the
injury had healed.

“Permanent injury and disfigur-
ation,” they offered.

The next night, Parker gal-
liantly played right field, wearinga
protective mask that somewhat
resembled a football helmet. ,

Forithe sake of justice, let’s give
the man a fair trial.

The judge calls for opening

arguments.

To represent the public, the
prosecuting attorney rises and
begins:

“Dave Parker is a black athlete
who hasn’t earned his million-
dollar-a-year contract. Since\he has
signed that fat contract, his
homerun and RBI totals are down.
Way down.”

Parker's attorney objects:

“Dave Winfield is a black player
who hasn’t performed up to his
two-million-dollar-per-year con-
tract, but the New York Yankee
fans haven't booed him out of
town. ‘

“George Foster is a black player
who recently signed a multi-

million dollar contract with the

Mets, and his batting average has
hovered around .230 all season, yet
he is still welcomed to the plate
with cheers.”

“Objection sustained,” says the
judge.
The defense rattles on:

“Even Rennie Stennett, ‘who
received a $600,000 contract to col-
lectsplinters for the San Francisco
Giants—-and who has since been
released by the Giants——wasn’t
treated as harshly as...

“Order in the courtroom," the
judge asks for, as he pounds his
gavel. -

The prosecuting attorney rises
and says:

“Parker has no one to blame but
himself. Last year, he showed up at
spring training weighing 260
pounds. He wasn't a lineman for
the Steelers. he was an outfielder

 
   

for the Pirates, recovering from an ‘

Achilles’ heel injury that he suf-
fered the previous season.”

He continues:
“The defendent is his own worst

enemy. Who is he to pop off to.the
good citizens of this city? He goes

around bragging to anyone who-

will listen that he is the best player"

in baseball. He’s not even close.

“And,. what about his recent
antics? He reportedly told some
'writers that the Pirates have had
increases in attendance because
Bill Robinson and Eddie
iSolomon—two black players-
were traded for Wayne Nordhagen
and Jim Morrison—two white
players. Then he was quoted as say-
ing that if the Pirates traded him,
they would sell the place out."

The prosecuting attorney grins
slightly and says: “The city rests its
case.”

clears his throat in preparation for
the tough task ahead.‘-

“There is no doubt that Dave
Parker is a free-spirited individual,
and that hasn’t helped him to win
over the fair people of this city--
not when he’s competing against-
personalities like those of Willie
Stargell and Joe Greene.

'~ “Perhaps we expect too much
from Parker. He is not, nor can be a

the prosecution is seeking?

boring if all athletes had Stargell’s

you imagine if every player inter-
viewed would respond in the same
manner as Stargell does?—‘Oh, I

then how unique would the Pirate

ments. There are none. He takes a

head in bewilderment.

“This is a puzzling case,” he
says. “The prosecution not only

pay their money to see the Pirates,
so it is up to them to reach a verdict.

Pretend that autumn has
befallen the great land of
‘America.

College football stadiums

across the nation are being
filled to capacity during Satur-
day afternoons, but the talk of
the nation is “who will win the
World Series?”.
 Ah, but this isn't any ordi-.
nary series. Due to apathy, the
league champions have been
voted out of this year’s World
Series, and the fans have picked
the Chicago Cubs to play
against the Minnesota Twins.

At first, Baseball Commis-
sioner Bowie Kuhn vetoed the
idea. However, player represen-
tative Marvin Miller said the
fans have the right to do as they
please since they support the
teams.

So without further ado, I give
you the 1982 World Series: the
Minnesota Twins vs. the~Chi-
cago Cubs.

In an unprecedented but jus-
tifiable move, Commissioner

'Kuhn announced that Leon

Gissendanner said. “Sure, every-
one wants to start, but Coach Chip-

man used me to the best of my .

ability.”

The‘Panthers went to the NCAA
tournament for the second consec-
utive year, and although they were
eliminated by North Carolina the
first time and Pepperdine the
second, Gissendanner’s speed and
talent were clearly visible.

Once Chipman replaced Grgu-

rich, who refused to allow players.

to participate in other sports, Gis-
sendanner started playing baseball
again. ‘

‘‘I hadn’t played baseball for two
years and was a little worried about
making the Pitt team,” he said,
“but the conditioning from the
basketball season left.me in great
shape for baseball.”

In baseball, as in basketball, Gis-

* sendanner used his speed to crack

the starting line-up. As the Panther
third baseman, hewas both a solid
defensive and offensive player.

In one game against Penn State,
he had four hits in four trips to the
plate and stole four bases.

During his senior year, he was
switched to the outfield so that
Coach Lewis could utilize his
speed. ‘Gissendanner responded
with the best season of his career,
hitting well over .300 and stealing
bases with great regularity. _

Looking back as a recent gradu-

speed.

Cubs-Twins Mee

Durham--the Cubs’ star
outfielder—carmot play in the
series. Durham, who partici-
pated in the all-star game and
finished the season with a .301
batting average, could change
the complexion of the series. If
he played, the Cubs would be
the overwhelming favorite.

Game One

The Cubs anticlimatically
win game one by forfeit. The
Twins inadverdently showed
up at the wrong ball park-
Comisky Park, home of the
Chicago White Sox. _

The Cubs, pleased with the
victory, scheduled Doug Bird
(4.77 ERA) to face Pete Redfern
(6.59 ERA) in game two.

Game Two

The Minnesota Twins, who
finished the ‘regular season with
a record of 30-18, -upset the
favored Cubs in a 10-9 thriller."
Minnesota scored seven
unearned runs and won, the
game in the top of the eighth
when Mickey Hatcher delivered
a bases-loaded,single to put the

"I was fortunate enough to get a
number of awards while I was play-

“My biggest thrills were the

Twins ahead for good.
Chicago, who scored a run in
every inning, benefitted from
seven walks, two passed balls
and four wild pitches, but their
ninth inning rally was cut short
when Bill Buckner struck out
with men on second andthird.

Game Three

A jam-packed crowd in
Hubert Humphrey Stadium
witnessed a miracle finish in the
third game, as the Twins came
from behind to win 6-5. For the
Twins, the two-game win
streak was their longest of the
year. For the Cubs, it was yet
another heart-breaking defeat.

The Cubs scored five runs in
the first, off of Minnesota starter
Bob Felton; The highlight was
back-to-back homeruns by Cub
second baseman Bump Wills
and Cub shortstop Larry Bowa.
The Twins fought back with
_six runs in the bottom of the
ninth. xi ‘

Ken Hrbek and Rich Gaetti
were the hitting stars, as Hrbek

Gissendanner said. “The National

followed with a solo homer
after Noles had walked in the
tying run. The game was the
first of its kind ever played at
Hubert Humphrey Stadium.

Game Four

Minnesota pitcher Bob Cas-
tillo and Cub ace Ferguson Jen-
kins squared off in a long duel.
Neither team could advance a
runner past second base until

Jenkins’ shut-out in the bottom
of the inning and won the game
1-0.

Wrigley Field was the site of
the fifth game of the World Ser-
ies. Again,‘another forfeit. This ,
time the Cubs were guilty. Evi-

nesota players began scratching
endlessly while they were going
through pre-game drills. The
Cubs protested the forfeit, but
Commissioner Kuhn rejected
their pleas.

Game Six

The Minnesota Twins were
on the verge of pulling off one
of the greatest upsets in World
Series history, needing only one
more victory. Prior to the game,
Twin owner Calvin Griffiths
offered to move the Twins out

of Minnesota if they could pull

a series upset.

Despite this incentive, the
Twins fell victim to a deter-
mined Cub team by a score of
9-8. The Cubs again scored one
run in each inning, giving
Doug Bird his first series
victory.

The Twins only scored in the
middle innings when Bob Cas-
tino slugged two homeruns in
as many at bats. The series was
tied up and headed back to Wri-

,WilI Gissendannner Play Football Next Season ‘ ?

when Darrell Gissendanner took all his tennis shoes after basketball season,he put on his spikes and played for the

gameagainst Penn State was some-
thing to’ remember.

“But my most memorable
moment was at the senior awards
banquet. Winning the award for
the outstanding student athlete
was special, because I had spent so
much time with my academics and
it had finally paid off.”

During his four years at Pitt,
Gissendanner lettered in basketball
and baseball and graduated with a
degree in computer science. But
his story doesn’t end there. He
hoped to be drafted in either base-
ball, basketball or both.

The baseball draft passed and
Gissendanner wasn't taken. He
ventured to Three Rivers Stadium
for what turned out to be disap-
pointing free-agent try-out.

“First they clocked us in the 40-
yard dash. I ran a 4.4 the second
time,” he said. “Then they gave
everyone five throws from the out-
field. I thought I threw well, but
the scout in charge just looked at
me and said ‘next’—a sort of ‘we’ll
call you, don’t call us’. Needless to
say, they weren't interested.”

The basketball draft is yet to
come (June 29), and Gissendanner
hopes that someone will take him
in the later rounds. , M

“I feel I have a good chance of
being picked for my speed. I’ve
been playing all my life, and I’d

The: Pitt News photo

prefer to play in the NBA.”

Gissendanner was hit with yet
another possibility in early May
when the Pittsburgh Steelers
offered to sign him as a free agent.
Soon the Washington Redskins
were calling him.

“The Redskins liked my time in
the 40, but they said I needed some
experience,” he said. “The Steelers
also liked my times and projected
me as a wide receiver or defensive
back. -

“If they wave a contract in front

of me, I would have to consider it, '

but the experience factor would
hinder me,” Gissendanner said.

With that in mind, Darrell Gis-
sendanner made the toughest deci-
sion he has yet to make.

“Back in March, Coach Fazio
approached me and said, ‘you'd
make a pretty good defensive back.’
I have the speed and agility, and
with a little work with weights I
would have a good size. So I
decided that if I wasn't drafted in
either baseball or basketball, I will
use my final year of sports eligi-
bilty at‘ Pitt and play college
football.”

If that’s the case, the Pantltersg

football team will be sporting two
former Clairton High School
teammates——Gissendanner and
defensive back Ray Weatherspoon.

Pitt fans may again be cheering
on Gissendanner.

Twin forfeit.

What a thrilling seventh
game it was. J

The Cubs (had Jenkins and
the Twins countered with Cas-
tillo. Again, no runs were
scored heading into the ninth.

The Twins then loaded up
the bases. With only one out,
the action began. Jenkins
stepped off the mound, reached
into his mouth, and then threw
the pitch.

As Jenkins was going into his
windup, the Minnesota batter,
Gaetti, squared around to bunt.
A suicide squeeze play was on,
as Hrbek broke for the plate.

On impact, the ball stuck to
the bat. Jenkins had doctored
the ball with chewingygum.

Keith Moreland, the Cub
catcher quickly grabbed the bat
from Gaetti and swung it, strik-
ing Mickey Hatcher, who was
racing home from third base.
Umpire John McSherry ruled
Gaetti out for exceeding the
baselines. Hatcher was also out 1
for trying to advance.

In the bottom of the ninth,

HAMLET
Stephen Foster Memorial

The annual Three Rivers Sha-
kespeare Festival exploded into life
last weekend with a fiery, colorful,
yet satisfyingly traditional inter-
pretation of “Hamlet,” perhaps

“lie greatest play ever written.

The play begins with Hamlet, a
college student and the crown
prince of a medieval Denmark, in
anguish over the sudden death of
his beloved father. The bitter
results of that death are also vexing
him. With a haste that smacks of
lust and indifference, if not some-
thing worse, Hamlet’s mother, the
queen, has remarried. This mar-
riage has a semi-incestuous cast to
it, as the groom is Hamlet’s uncle,
the dead king’s brother, who has
assumed the crown that by right
and custom should have fallen to
Hamlet. When his father's ghost

pears to Hamlet, telling him

I at he was murdered by Hamlet’s

uncle, Hamlet is not surprised, but
feels rather that his ‘exceedingly
dark and disturbing grief has been
prophetic.

From that point on, this drama
of vengeance,,lust, doubt, and psy-
chological tormet rushes headlong
to its conclusion, the comic and
reflective passages only contribut-
ing to the tension and dynamism of

Garp.’

My first reaction to Robin Willi-

am's casting .as T.S. Garp was

“Oh, no...‘The World According"

To Mork'...or worse...‘Popeye II.’

After screening the movie, how-
ever, I can’t think of a better choice
for the role than Williams, who
gives a truly natural performance
with virtually no trace of self-
consciousness. In fact, if one had to
sum up the movie in one word,'i_t
would be ‘‘natural;’' this movie
flows naturally from the book, and

although there are some rough

 0[S and necessary omissions,

George Roy Hill has crafted john

Irving's best seller into a series of

funny, touching, but always
revealing vignettes filled with fine,
understated performances from all
the principals.

But considering what’ he had to
work with, one of the most enjoya-
ble and bestselling books of the last
five years and a cast composed of
some of the best contemporary

 theater actors, how could he miss?

Glenn Close, in her first screen
ole, plays the strong-willed jenny
 -Ids, and, although many of the

tails of her early life and eventual

nion with Technical Sargeaiit
Garp have been left otit, she infuses
the part with a convincing starclied
white character.

Mary Beth Hurt does a good job

as (}al‘[):S‘(}ltt’i_]_ lieleaguered wife,

...-

The Play’s
 TheThmg

the play.

The whole structure of this play
is based on the inner architecture of
one man, the nakad sole of Hamlet,
exposed to earthly stirife and cos-
mic terror, infinitely isolated by the
urgent, unnegotiable, complex
and ambiguous demands of his ter-
ribel destiny.

This play is the drama of
Hamlet’s soul forced into despar-

ate confrontation with the ultimate
concerns of life, from the oedipal to
the religious, and the archetypal
events and characters -of the play
are like projections of that intense
and heroically suffering soul into
the outer world. It is this sense of
psychological epiphany, this feel-
ing of a truth forever hidden in
every soul, that is being at last
revealed that has made this play

irrestible to both actors and
audiences for almost four
centuries.

Since the character of Hamlet so
completely dominates the play, the
interpretation given the role of
Hamlet by the actor playing him
will determine the character of a
production, and that production
will stand or fall on the strength
that actor brings to the part.

Robert Martini’s Hamlet is a
cavalier—-fiery, athletic, aggressive

, But the real standout perfor-

touching Roberta .Muldoon,
(former Philadelphia Eagles tight

winner John Lithgow, probably
most familiar as the psychotic CIA
agent in “Blow Out.” This is not
the comic drag of “Some Like It

human portrayal of a man whose

almost extroverted; and that inter-

-pretation colors this whole produc-

tion. Martini is at his strongest in
the passionate sequence, at his
weakest in the reflective, and the
same is true of his production as a

whole.
But what actor can be all

Hamlets, and what production can
do justice to all the aspects of
“Hamlet”? Martini has energy.
intensity, sincerity, and a love of.
the Shakespearean poetic line,
which he speaks with unflagging
clarity and an occasionally striking
sense of purpose.

While this production would
improve if it would stop and think
occasionally, it also moves with
power, coherence and decision,
communicating a headlong excite-

E.T.:

 

ment and dynamism. The physi-
cality of this production is
striking—the action onstage com-
bines athletic spontaneity with
tight craftsmanship. The exciting,
superbly choreographed sword-
fight is an example of this, as
Hamlet and Laertes swash and
buckle all over the stage, like
Robin Hood and Zorro competing
for the Olympic gold.

In addition to Martini, the other
principal players are quite fine.
Daniel Frezzo plays Polonius, the
semi-senile counselor, with
authority and humor. Alex Cole-
man (who also choreographed the
duel) is strong and malign as Clau-
dius the usurper. Kate Young is an
attractive Queen Gertrude, Arthur

—Page~¥5<' .

  

 
  

Beers a distinguished Ghost, Dou-
glas Krizner a dignified Horatio,
David Kuhns a suitably choleric
Laertes, and Claire Beckman as
Ophelia, Hamlet’s lover, is tender
and vulnerable. The costumes and
scenery are good as well.

This production of “Hamlet,”
the first in Pittsburgh in 12 years is
a fine one. It runs through July 3.
Director Kathleen George, the Uni»
versity of Pittsburgh Theatre, and
the City Theatre Company have
done well. I've never enjoyed a

PAUL HOUGHTON

The Story of a Boy and His Alien

There were hints in “Close
Encounters of the Third Kind”
that Steven Spielberg was more
than a terrific technical director,
that somewhere under all those
special effects was a human being
who desired to make films that
touched hearts.

One hint was the casting of Fran-
cois Truffaut, the other was the
wonderful gaze of a five-year-old
boy as he watched a spaceship land
in his front yard.

One sensed that Spielberg was
aware that it was his imagination
as a child that fueled his science
fiction films, not stunning special
effects.

Nothing, however, could have
prepared us for “E.T. The Extra-
Terrestrial,” which magnificently
brings a childlike wonder to the
space age. Although “E.T.” stays
earthbound for the most part, it
soars far beyond the “Star Wars”
mold into the more ambiguous and
much more rewarding world of the
human heart. I

This is Spielberg’s masterpiece,
and the best movie of the last
decade because it gives us some-
thing to hold onto, think about
and maybe even cry about.

There are two heroes in “E.T.;”
Elliot, a 10-year-old boy who
rescues the other hero—-E.T., who
has been accidently marooned on
earth when his spaceship had to
make an emergency flight home.

» Elliott (Henry Thomas) is a clas-
sic character out of childrens litera-
ture; think of Dorothy, Tom Saw-
yer and Oliver Twist.

He's an outsider because his feel-
ing and desires run deeper than do
those of his peers, and like those
characters he finds somebody who
can draw him out of himself, get
rid of hislonelinessand make him

. . . . , . . . . . , . . . . . . ¢ - . - - n p . . u z » u o u v . u - p o . . o . . - . - . - - . . .. - .

grow up a little.

Spielberg has a marvelous affin-
ity with Elliott. He is a space-age
Truffaut, respecting the child,
allowing him to be wonderfully
nonchalant as well as emotional.

Henry Thomas is enormously
enchanting as Elliott, with a beau-
tifully expressive face and a calm,
studious personality that explains
both his loneliness ‘and his
empathy toward E.T. ‘

E.T. is not an easy creature to
learn to like; his neck extends in
enormous spurts, his eyes bulge

out and his skin is a scaly, froglike
greenish brown. But the friendship
between him and Elliott grows-—
from the heart——slowly and surely,
until they become psychic twins.
Whatever E.T. feels Elliott feels.
When E.T. tastes his first beer, Elli-
ott, at school in biology class, gets
drunk. The result is mass hysteria,
a revolt to free the soon-to-be-
dissected frogs and Elliott’s first
kiss.. ‘

As their friendship grows it
becomes evident that E.T. must
return home, for he is terribly
homesick; if he stays with Elliott he
will get weaker and weaker until he
dies. /

This is where the film takes on
an emotional fever, and like all
great children's literature, throws
the audience back and, forth
between needs and desires. Even
though it breaks his heart, Elliott
knows he must help E.T. return
home.

The ominous presence of misun-
derstanding adults also threatens
the paradise Elliott and E.T. have
found. The big villians in this film
are the unfeeling, technical ambi-
tions of the adult world, which
cannot coexist with the world of
Elliot and E.T.

E.T.’s quest for home is a mod-
em “Wizard of Oz." John Willi-
ams’ score is reminiscent of the

H music of “Oz,” and the emotions

running through the film are as
scary, deep and sadly triumphant.

“E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial” is a
magnificent movie. Everything
about it is unpretentiously perfect,
wonderfully modern and so emo-
tionally fulfilling that it cannot
fail to attach itself" to your heart.
 is even worth a wait in line
with a million screamingchildren.
That’s how terrific it is!
