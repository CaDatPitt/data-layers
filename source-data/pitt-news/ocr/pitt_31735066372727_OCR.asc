A fire in a basement storage
room in Schenley Hall Tuesday
morning has been ruled arson by
a Pittsburgh Fire Department‘,
investigator, and city fire officials /
are upset with the way campus
police handled the incident.

The storage room is normally
locked, but was open Tuesday
morning while Pitt employees Ray
Caliendo and Joseph Notsch
moved chairs out of it into another
area. According to the campus
police report, the Pitt employees
and Bill (1oulter,a worker with the
firm renovating the Student
I'nion, discovered the fire. The
reports says Caliendo saw a small
flame at the rear of some cartons of
ping-pong tables.

While (lziliendo went for :1
bucket of water, Notscli stayed
behind. In the meantime, the
police report says, the fire spread
up toward the ceiling. Notsch then
went for tnore water. Notsch,
Caliendo and Coulter put out the
fire with three fire extinguishers. _

The campus police became
aware of the fire when Pitt News
secretary Andrea Shuss smelled
smoke around 10 a.rn. and called
them. She and reporter Fred Beers
had noticed smoke in The Pitt
News editorial offices, which are

You’ve just received that
check in the mail from your
parents. Now you can buy your
books for the term and still have
enough’ money left for a week-
end at the bars. But you're sur-
prised, as you are every term,
that your books cost much more
than expected. The. bookstore
took another chunk out of your
term’s budget.

That scene is very common at
most college bookstores around
the nation. Inflation and other
factors have caused the price of
textbooks to rise drastically.
Although mosi Pitt students
think the price they pay for
books is outrageous, it is no dif-
ferent from some other univer-
sities in the country. a Pitt News
survey learned.

On the other hand, Pitt stu-
dents have no say in the policies
of the bookstore, as do students
in schools such as Harvard,
Montana State University and
the University of Texas. Stu-

dents at those three schools sit
on the board of directors and
make decisions that will affect
their peers’ pocketbooks.

These stores are called coop-
eratives, and unlike Pitt's store,
they have virtually no ties with
their universities. The histories
of the co-ops are long and most
people at the co-ops don’t know
any other way of business.

The Harvard Cooperative
Society, known as the Coop,
was established in 1882 by a
group of students at Harvard.
The original intention was to
reduce the cost of books, accord-
ing to an article in The New
York Times.

Most of the co-ops that exist
today are patterned after the
Harvard one, said Charles
Walker, vice president of the
University of Texas co-op. He
sid their co-op has not been
around as long as Harvard's. It
was established in 1896.

UT’s co-op has four students
and four faculty members on its

ﬂ board of directors. The students

Comparing Policies and Prices of . J
Nationalcollege Bookstores  

are chosen in a campus—wide
election and the faculty
members are chosen by the pres-
ident of the university. The
president also sits on the board
as a figurehead, Walker said.

Montana State University has
three students and three faculty
members on its co-op’s board of
directors. The university’s
Director of Administration also
sits on the board ex-officio, said
Jamie Bulen, administrative
assistant for the MSU co-op.
This co—op has been in exist-
ence since 1931.

Although there are students
in decision-making positions at
the co-ops, the prices of the text-
books are not any cheaper than
those at Pitt, a university-
controlled establishment.

The textbook that was used
for the survey sells for $21 at the
Pitt bookstore. It is an introduc-
tory book used by many Pitt stu-
dents. The amount that is listed
on the book is the price that is
set by the publisher.

FAS
  Deficit
Large

By iet=i= RUSSELL

Last year's deficit in the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences budget was the
largest in FAS history, it was
revealed at yesterday's FAS
meeting.

The $800,000 deficit was
$100,000 more than budgetary
predictions. -

In other matters, College of Arts
and Science Dean Irwin Shulman
said it was difficult for him to be
optimistic about the effects of Pres-
ident Reagan’_s proposed budget
cuts. He said that next year's
enrollment is “uncertain,” partly
because it's not known whether
those cuts will be approved by
Congress.

Regarding curriculum reform,
he said that everything is “proceed-
ing pretty much on schedule." The
reform has "engendered a very
warm response from high
schools,” he said.

  Shroud
Lecture

By DAVID JOHNSON

Did Jesus Christ by some
mysterious process leave his
bodily image on a piece of
linen?

The Shroud of Turin, so
called because it is presently
located in Turin, Italy, is an
ancient cloth with an image,
similar to a photographic nega-
tive, of a man who apparently
was severely beaten, crowned
with thorns, and crucified.

Dr. John Desalvo, research
consultant to the Shroud of
Turin Project, will lecture on
the Shroud 8 p.m. Sunday, Feb.

Rosenberg both emphasized dur-
ing the meeting that final exams
should be given at their scheduled
times during the finals week. “I am
dismayed that this principle is of-
ten violated,” Schulman said.
Elections to the FAS Nominat-
ing Committee were also held at
the meeting. The committee,
which selects candidates for vacan-
cies in several FAS, CAS, and
Graduate—related councils, now
has six new members; Aaron Sheon
and Donna Hnffmeister from the

Another issue the council dis-
cussed was tenure. Professor Sarah
Thomason said that fewer people
are reviewed for obtaining tenure
now compared to the past, while a
higher percentage of those
reviewed are passing the scrutiny.
She also stated her dissatisfaction
with the appeals process, saying

can either balance sales or make
a profit with the selling of such
things as sweatshirts. mugs and
other miscellaneous items.

Walker said that if a profit is
made, the co-op announces it
and those students who saved
their receipts from the begin-
ning of the term receive a refund
check in the mail. UT's co-op is
a $12 million a vear operation
and services -H.000 students.
Walker said that the attraction
of the co-op is not only the
rnottcv.

“It's a philo.~;ophic;-tl thing."
he said. "There are some stu-
dents who are looking for con
tiol. This gives them titl."

The to-op has 90 percent of
the hooks that are reqiiiretl and
when some t‘et';ttii‘t-tl hooks can-
not he found. it's not always the
stores Iault. \‘vaIl\er said.

".Sometiines there are proh-
Icms with the professors who
dont get inforrnation to the
book store on time," Walker
::l(lLlt,‘(i.

MSU’s co-op is also a non-
profit organization, Bulen said.
She explained they try to come
as close to a zero profit as
possible.

“We make projections three
times a year and drop the mar-
gin if necessary,” she said.

Mary Bonach, the director of
Pitt's bookstore, said that it
would be almost impossible to
start a book co-op at Pitt. She
said that the store would have to
have at least $250,000 to
$400,000 in inventory.

Bonach said that the Pitt

bookstore is not “geared
towards making a profit." The
store is able to charge the pub-
lisher’s price on textbooks
because items such as tee-shirts
and mugs make up the differ-
ence. If it were not for those
items, she said, the price of text-
books would be above the sug-
gested retail price.
According to Eugene
Richardson, associate vice
chancellor for business and
finance, the I)ookstore's actual
revenue for 1981 was $7,223,021.
The expenses totaled 7.0;')0,:'):')0.

That means the profit was
$172,471.
Richardson said that the

profit has been used and stu-
dents “shottltl Iiave seen some
things heing done over there."

Bonaclt said that the bookstore I

is planning on putcliasing new
cash registers to repl;ite the 10
vear old tnodcls currently used.

The projected I982 budget
shows a profit of .iH2,l6:').
Richardson said the drop is
because of inflation and other
factors.

Bonach said that although
the idea of a co-op at Pitt has
been suggested in the past, she
does not think one will ever be
developed. She said Harvard
“almost gives nothing back” to
their students and that a co-op
wouldn’t work at Pitt.

“There hasn’t been a co-op
developed since 1927,” Bonach
said. “The last one that was set
up was at the University of
Washington and that one has
been discontinued."

“We started smelling smells
from an electrical fire," Shuss said.
She and Beers checked to see iflany
of the walls were warm before cal-
ling the police

A campus police officer arrived
within about two minutes. He
acknowledged that there was
apparently a fire. A Pitt News
reporter monitoring the campus

I police radio heard the officer report

that there was a fire, but that “no
fire equipment is needed at this
time." A

The campus police dispatcher
responded that he had not called
for any fire equipment.

Their failure to call the Fire
Department when they received
Shuss’s call is an apparent viola-
tion of a department policy.

On Decembe‘r 21, 1981, campus
police Public Safety Director Wil-
liam Tucker issued a memoran-

' dum to his officers which states,

“Whenever a report of smoke or
fire is received by department per-
sonnel, the Communications
Officer will immediately. notify

ﬁilittsburgh Fire Alarm...”

The campus police report says
that the "city fire marshall” was
called, but had not yet responded
when the report was written. The
city fire investigators arein a separ-
ate office from Pittsburgh Fire
Alarm '

City fire officials said they never
received a report of a fire, only a
request for an investigator.

According «to Captain Joseph
Somma, head of the city Fire
Department’s Fire Prevention
bureau, the campus police acted
illegally by failing to request fire-
’fighting equipment when they first
learned of a possible fire at Schen-
ley Hall.

law." He said that he was aware of
such a policy, however, and that he
was personally committed to coop-
eration with City emergency service
officials. ‘

Tucker said there may have been
“an error in judgment” on the part
of the officers involved.

“We do make errors. We're not
above trying to correct them. They
(city officials) have jurisdiction to
investigate. We also do,” he said.

Battalion Chief Thomas Regan,
who supervises the Pitt area, said
he received a phone call Wednes-
day morning from a Schenley Hall
manager asking why the {Fire
Department had not responded the
previous morning. That was the
first notice the department had
received that there was a fire.
Regan immegiately went to Schen-
ley along with a pumper, ladder
truck and Captain Thomas Hitch-
ings, a city arson investigator.

Hitchings, Regan and other fire-
fighters conducted an inspection of
the building and the fire scene.

Hitchings’ findings: “The fire is
definitely of an incendiary nature.
We've ruled out spontaneous or
accidental causes. It’s arson, more
of a harrassment type." He esti-
mated damages at $200 to $300.

According to Tucker, the cam-
pus police have not reached the

same conclusion. He said only that
the department is investigating it.

“I don’t care what the fire mar-
shall said,” Tucker said. “The cap-
tain has not showed me evidence.”

Captain Somma: "If there's any
fire, they're obligated to call the
Fire Department...They could
have destroyed evidence."

Tucker said the police officers
began the investigation because
“we can't wait‘forever. He (the
detective) is a police officer. He can
start investigations.”

According to Tucker, the investi-
gating campus police detective has

taken the Allegheny County Fire
Academy arson investigation
course. Somma says his men have
“fifteen to twenty years of fire-
fighting experience and many
hours in fire investigation training
and continuing investigation.”

Tucker was asked how he moni-
tors his officers to see that depart-
mental policies are carried out.

“Ii review every report every
morning," Tucker replied. “They
(the officers) put in if the Fire
Department is called.”

Tucker said he did not take
action when he read Tuesday’s
report which said that although

mas Regan conducted an Inspection of

the fire investigator was requested,
one had not arrived.

Asked if he now believes he
should have seen that the Fire
Department was notified, he ans-
wered, “You may be right.”

Hitchings reported that there
were two fires in the Towers dormi-
tories on Monday, which could
have been arson. They were trash
fires, which he said could have
been accidental, or may also have
been harrassment-type fires, like
the one at Schenley Hall.

Tucker said that although he
“wasn’t sure" if he was awareof the
fires Monday, he é‘didn't see any
connection between the three.”

Speaking Up
Forandlnthe
Med School  

The fact that Pitt medical and dental students met Tues-
day to discuss the effects of the Reagan budget surprised us
lffliltllgalpaéheengalft lthat some students, albeit a minority,

g nerve to go public with some of their
thoughts about the status of their educational futures.

Neverthel-ess, many of the students were hesitant to heap
any criticism upon the medical school itself, instead pref-
preferring to shift the blame for't'heir dismal financial
straits to the federal and state government. Although we
commend the Student Concerns Committee co-
ordinators Tim Whitney and Steve Hasley, they’re going
to have to shout a lot louder if they want Washington , or
even Harrisburg, tohear them.

Maybe it will just take the collective effort and voice of
the medical and dental school student body to make more
noise-—unfortunately, no one seems to want to come for-
ward except for a select few.

At Tuesday’s meeting in Scaife Hall, Hasley warned
that because of cutbacks in federal loan programs, the
average student's debt after graduation may go higher
than the $70,000 projected for 1985. The sum of $10,000 is a
lot of money, whether or not it’s a debt. In fact, $70,000
may just buy a comfortable home without any mortgage to
worry about. The point is, that’s a lot of money, and
anyone who has to pay it when they shouldn't have to
certainly has something to complain about, publicly or
privately.

The medical school, unfortunately, doesn’t have many
people like Steve Hasley and the Student Concerns Com-
mittee who are confident enough to get up on their hind
legs and growl when faced with financial danger. With a
few noteable exceptions, such as Dr. Robert Glew, a long-
time gadfly of the medical school, there aren’t many per-
sons in Scaife Hall known for their open criticism of the
medical school or the government.

What the medical school is known for, especially by the
students, is that there are subtle forms of punishment for
speaking out. This was evidenced in a recent letter to the
editor published in this newspaper by medical students
who preferred to remain anonymous because of their fear
of reprisal. It’s rare enough, however, that we get letters to
the editoron the medical school from persons other than
Dr. Glew, let alone anonymous students.

But this shouldn't have to be the case.

Granted, a medical education is a very ardous expe-
rience from the first day a student decides to become a
premed. In the March 1 issue of Newsweek, there is a story
about “premed syndrome,” described as a “disease that
spreads like a viral infection among the 36,000 U.S. under-
graduates competing fiercely for admission to the nation's
medical schools.”

And. then, of course, once the student is accepted there
are at. least four more years of intensive study before the
student can hang a shingle outside his office.

So, given the intensive nature of medical education,
both inside and outside the classroom, it’s understandable
that there might be some hesitancy on the part of the
medical students to take the time out to complain.

But now that their present and future financial situa-
tions are open to doubt, there’s no better time for the
medical students to get out and make their views known.

Students do not run universities.
On the contrary, universities_ are
created to make students read
books, write papers, and think in
ways they would not otherwise
read, write, or think. This argu-
ment applies particularly to the
basic core ‘of understanding a uni-
versity imparts to all of its students.
A university gives every engineer
and philosopher, lawyer, chemist
and teacher a common understand-
ing of the physical and social
worlds, and of the history of men
and their thoughts. Studentsmust
realize that, alone, they are not pre-
pared to decide what should be
included in this core. In this sense,
then, students enter universities to
be told what to do.

This is not the limit of the uni-
versity’s role, however. The univer-
sity must refrain as much as
possible from telling students what
to think. Instead, it should help
them to discover how to think in
the hope that new minds will over-
turn old beliefs in favor of better
ones. For this to happen, students
must not be completely locked out
of the running of universities.
Teachers may answer questions,
but students must be free to ask,
and to challenge the answers.
Administrators may Believe that
courses and programs are well
designed, but the test of_ a pro-
gram’s quality is its ability to edu-
cate students. Students themselves
may recognize failures, point out
mistakes, and suggest improve-
ments. Most importantly, teachers
and administrators must realize
that not all learning takes place"in
the classroom. Students learn also
by participating in decision-
making, by seeing their own ideas
considered and adopted—or chal-
lenged and rejected—and by under-

taking practical responsibilities of
a type the classroom ' cannot
provide. 0

Thus we see students in two dif-
ferent relationships to university
decision-making..In the first, poli-
cies are formulated and imposed
upon students, and rightly so. In
the second, students are invited to
participate in the development of
policies and to share in the respon-
sibility for carrying them out. It is
the, role of the Academic Affairs
Committee (AAC) of The Student
Government Board to see that stu-
dents receive the maximum benefit
in both of these relationships.

First, the AAC must help stu-
dents to understand the academic
regulations of the university. The
AAC is currently preparing a sum-
mary of the recently adoptd curric-
ulum requirements. This
information will not only be
passed along to students imme-
diately, but will also be made avail-
able to students entering Pitt after
the reforms have taken effect.
Through this program and others
like it the AAC hopes that all stu-
dents will better understand what
is required of them.

- Second, the AAC can inform stu-
dents of the wide rangeof academic
offerings at Pitt. The programs
that make up Academic Week are
intended to highlight academic
opportunities which many stu-
dents might otherwise not hear of.

Third, the AAC maintains con-
tact with faculty and administra-
tors throughout the university,
providing students with an open
line of communication with
policy-makers.

Fourth, to ensure that all stu-
dents benefit from our efforts, the
AAC is working to include in its
membership students who have
traditionally been excluded, for
whatever reasons, from student

Fred Koloc Friendly,
Considerate, Interested

‘ Dear Editor:

I would like to commend The
Pitt News and reporter Bill Hess
for the profile of Fred Koloc, direc-
tor of Advising in the College of
Arts and Sciences (Feb. 22). It is an
accurate account of the administra-
tor who truly cares for both the stu-
dents and advisors.

When I returned to college after
three years in the work force, I
anticipated exciting challenges,
not the confusing problems I
found. Not knowing where to go to
alleviate my problems, I retreated
to the ninth floor of the Cathedral
of Learning. Fred Koloc listened

».?a‘*.e“§‘V‘3'§d-uiéﬁtkihdlt tookwe 

time to help me untangle Pitt’s red ’

tape. 1 left the advising center
greatly relieved.

On consequent meetings
throughout my two years here,
Fred Koloc has always shown
friendly, considerate interest in my

progress.

I will be graduating this
summer, leaving the red tape
behind, thanks to Fred, who

offered help to a student when she
needed it most. My compliments to
The Pitt News for recognizing this
valuable administrator.

government. We are concerned
with recruiting new members from
the whole student body rather than
from the same old circles of friends
who have traditionally populated
the SGB offices.

Developing a representative
membership is a difficult task, and
no doubt a few skeptics will point
out ‘that it has been undertaken
often in the past, and with little‘
success. In my first two months as

chairman, however, the AAC has~—~

taken steps in this direction. Mem-
bership has increased from three to
fifteen students. All of the new
members are also new to student
government. The record’ is not
without its shortcomings, how-
ever, as all committee members are
white: and three-fifths are men. I
have set a goal for membership,
including departmental represen-
tatives, to reach 100 by the end of

the term. It is my hope that these 7

100 students will more accurately
represent the student population.

This is a rebuilding year for the
AAC. Programs neglected in the
past are being reinstated and new
ones planned. Contacts with the
administration must be built again
because of inactivity in the past
year. The extensive system of
representation which allowed the
AAC easy access to student and
faculty opinion in each undergrad-
uate department must again be
instituted. These are
tasks and, frankly, our chances of
success are not dazzling. But the
stakes are high. At stake are the
opportunities for students to par-
ticipate in promoting their own
academic and intellectual well-
being.

year, the points given to the top 16
places will out do Pitt’s scoring by
its National-quality swimmers.
West Virginia, Penn State and
Maryland each have as many as‘20
or more entries in the three-day
meet. That represents at least four
more Eastern caliber swimmers in
five events each. _

Pitt is ranked -within the top
three in almost every event, but
-without backup swimmers to take
the eighth through 16th places,
Pitt can almost say goodbye to its
chance at a seventh straight Eastern
title.‘

Pitt’s sore spots are both one-and
three-meter diving where the
Panthers will enter only one diver,
Rex Nordheimer. Challengers
WVU, Penn State and Maryland all
have two or more top eight Eastern

divers entered in the meet.

Pitt’s relays should make the
NCAA Nationals. r'itt’s 400-yard
medley relay is ranked first going
into next Thursday night’s event,
and Pitt’s 800-yard freestyle relay
will be one of the favorites in Fri-
day night’s final event.

The ‘Panthers have seven top
sprint freestylers who, in any com-
bination, should win this one, as
well as the 400-yard freestyle relay
Saturday night.

Individually, Rick Carter, Sandy
Pidgeon, Ed LaNoue and-Ed Ber-
gan each have excellent chances of
qualifying for Nationals notjust in
the relays but in two or even three
individual events.

But even this kind of quality will
have its trouble overcoming the
sheer number of swimmers entered
by the three teams that finished
right‘ behind Pitt last year—West
Virginia, Penn State and Maryland
are all well-staffed while Pitt is
experiencing its weakest depth in
years. Pitt coach Fred Lewis and
diving coach Julian Krug have
been doing their work recruiting
‘both in state and out of state to ease
the problem before it becomes
chronic. -

Krug was e:specially hurt when
one top diver went out early with a

’ knee injury and his defending East-

ern Champion diver had to quit
due to academic problems. Krug

The state of West Virginia was try-
ing to stare them down. A
sixth-ranked basketball team was
trying to run them into oblivion.
Their own youthful, fragile psyche
was ready to collapse, ready to
throw the game away as so many
teams before them had done.
That would have been the easy
thing do, as well as the expected.
After all, the Pitt Panthers were
young and the West Virginia
crowd and team were experienced
_ in sucking out a team’s composure
and confidence. _
For awhile, the game that looked
as if it might be a routsuddenly
looked like an upset in the making,
though West Virginia finally
prevailed—barely--82-77.

- . ' Early in the game, after a couple

of missed foul shots by Pitt’s Clyde
Vaughan and a turnover, the West
Virginia Mountaineers turned a
31-28 game into a 46-34 halftime
lead. Oh, but to be sucked into the
Mountaineer trap.

For the first 15 minutes, Pitt
played with them, trading baskets,
elbows and rebounds. And then, a

. turnover followed by a scoreoff

fastbreak that never fails, and West
Virginia started a scoring,run that
lifted the crowd to a deafening
pitch inside the Coliseum. Pitt
players begin to rush, trying to
keep up. Another turnover, a bad
shot, and you’re trapped. Ever been
alone with 16,704 fanatics? That
was the Pitt Panthers at the end of
\the first half. Alone, rubber legged,
ready to be blown out of a basket-
ball game.

"I couldn’t getthe flow ofthe
game because ofthe noise. It dis-
turbed me,” Pitt freshman guard

George Allen would say. “We

year. eight girls who trained under 1

‘him took first through seventh
and 20th place at the WPlAL’s
High School Championships last
week. Three men who trained
urider Krug took first, third ‘and
fifth. ‘ .

Despite the diving setbacks at
Pitt this season, Krug looks confi-
dently to next year although he
admits that Pitt’s glory as men’s
Eastern Diving Champions will
probably take until 1984 to
recapture.

"We’re in a rebuilding process,”
said Krug. We lost a diver who won
Easterns as a sophomore and a
freshman who haclgmat National
potential, but we'll have to start all
_over. Rex will make consolation
finals, but he alone can't fill the
hole that was left. This is Rex’s first
big meet with 15 teams all sending
athletes. But my overall planning
for the future, as well as the recruit-
ing I’ve been doing this season,
should have our men’s team back
up to five or six divers by next
yearf’

Pitt Becomes 24th Victim

-stopped concentrating because of

lack of maturity. We stopped doing
the things that we were supposed
to. We panicked,” Panther guard
Billy Culberston said.

Pitt coach Roy Chipman must
have been panicking also. His team
ws a game and a half from going
into the Eastern 8 tournament. His
team that had surprised so many
was a game and a half from going
the one test they had to pass: play-
ing in WVU and playing well.

Not that it was an easy task. The
Mountaineers had disposed of 22
teams in a row. They had not lost at
home in more than 30 games.

But Chipman felt that his team
could play with the Mountaineers.
They had once at the‘ Field House
and needed to do so badly in the
Colise_um——needed to prove to
themselves that, under adverse con-
ditions, they could overcome their
youth.

For Chipman's ‘sake, and for the
Eastern 8 tournament's sake, the
Pitt Panthers passed the test.

They passed it with two fresh-

- men on the floor in the second half:

George Allen and center Andre
Williams. They, passed with their
spark, second-leading scorer Dar-
rell Gissendanner, on the bench
after fouling out. They passed
against the sixth-ranked. team in
the country, in front of 16,704 peo-
ple who would have liked nothing
better than to have seen Pitt wither
away. ‘

“I feel good about this even
though we lost the game. We didn’t
give up at halftime,” Chipman
said of his team’s near successful
comeback which ended in an oddly
encouraging defeat.

Pitt overcame the 12-point half-
time deficit much the same way
they overcame the 10-point deficit
at the Field House: the .1-3-1 zone.
The harassing defense shook the
Mountaineers, restrained them and

Gamble could save $13 for students
who wish to go to all three full days
of swimming. ' -

tures 20 teams. They will meet at

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
goes to West Virginia tomorrow to
take on West Virginia and the
North Carolina State Wolfpack
still hobbled by injuries.

We have many pulled muscles
and tendon problems this time of
year because the season is getting
old,” D’Amico said. “Everybody
will compete but the question will
be how good our performances will
be because of the injuries.

Pitt should have little trouble
handling West Virginia because
they are not that strong this year.
West Virginia has let it be known
that they are dropping their gym-
nastics program which caused a lot

~of people to quit the team or go

elsewhere.‘

most importantly, slowed them
down. Twelve times WVU suc-
cumbed to the intense pressure of
the defense. _

“It definitely bothered them. ‘It
got them tired," Dwayne Wallace
said of the defense that brought Pitt
back.

“We stopped taking it them; we
became non-assertive that defense
hurt us,” said WVU’s Greg Jones,
who scored 22 points.

Clyde’ Vaughan hitting for l6
second-half points and a 13-13
night from the foul line didn’t hurt
the comeback either. Neither did
two freshmen who are the corner-

stone for the future. The duo of‘

Allen and Williams hit for 17
second-half points. Williams hit
all seven of his foul shots while
Allen continually drove around the
Mountaineer guards for. inside
assists or baskets. '

“The coach told me to play my
game in the second half. So I just
started taking it to them, and I

didn’t worry about the crowd,”

Allen said. -

The comeback pulled Pitt up to
only,a two-point deficit. Youth
suddenly reared its head. It made
the previcmsly cool Panthers rush
shots, throw two balls away and
lose the game.

In defeat, however, came the

proof that this team is ready for the C’ --

Eastern 8 tournament. A tourna-
ment which might feature a third
Pitt-West Virginia game. “It’lljust
be another war," Mountaineer
guard Tony Washam said.

“There is a rivalry, but we have

teeth together and don’t like to
look at each other.”

D’Amico said it might be a close

leads the team in rebounds‘with a

Lewis' 62 thefts. Although her
scoring average has dropped to 8.7
points per game, she has pushed
her free throw percentage over .500

“Gail has become more of an
offensive player this season,” said

Aughbui'ns' improvement can
be attributed to hard work and tied-
ication. It has been speculated that
Saurer gave Augliburns the oppor-
tunity to "show her sniff," whereas
the Balthaser staff would not.

“There are some benefits and
drawbacks to every coaching staff
and philosophy," said Augliburns.
“I can only say that both staffs gave
me an opportunity to do what I
wanted most—play to the best of
my ability."

It is that talent, along with her
uncanny‘ ability to answer the call
for a big play, that the Lady Pan-

thers will miss next year. And the  ,,

fans will miss Aughburns’ antics,
which often turned a questionable
call into something acceptable
only because they knew Gail would

Spikers Back in Action

By LISA GRENEVICKI

The Pitt men’s volleyball team
resumes regular-season play this
weekend on the road against league
foes East Stroudsburg and George
Mason.

The Panthers will still be with-
out the services of two key players,
junior Dan O'Donnell and fresh-

man Tony Zortea, who are both out

with injuries.

The Pitt spikers, up against two
of the‘-weaker league teams, will be
looking for two wins to improve
their league record, which cur-
rently stands at l-O.

Pitt will play East Stroudsburg,
one of the league founders, on Sat-
urday, then travel to George Mason
on Sunday.

The Panthers have beaten
George Mason twice already this
season in‘ tournament play and
beat East Stroudsburg the three
times they faced them last year.

"East Stroudsburg is a small
team, size-wise, and are under a
new coach," said Pitt Coach Ray
Reilly. “They’re in a rebuilding
year, so I really don’t know what to
expect from them."

Pitt will face a full strength
George Mason, a team that always
gives the Panthers a good match,
according to Reilly.

“George Mason is stronger this
year," said Reilly. “They have a
few good freshmen. They're always
tough and I know they’ll give us a
good match.”

Pitt willhave to face both teams
without Zortea and O’Donnell.

O’Donnell suffered a severe
ankle sprain during the Pitt Invita-
tional two weeks ago. According to
Pitt athletic trainer Keith Benson,
it isn't known yet how long
O'Donnell will be out.

.9
“O’Donnell is in‘a cast right now
to let his ankle rest and let the swel-

ling go down,” said Benson. “We
don't know if he’ll be back this sea-
son. The doctor will determine that
by the end of the week.”

Zortea has been out several weks
with a leg injury suffered at the
Ohio State Invitational. He is
expected to be back by next week.

;‘Zortea is progressing nicely," "B

said Benson.’ “He started running
this week and we feel he’ll be back
practicing by next week and hope-
fully in the lineup soon.”

After three weeks of tough com-
petition, Reilly gave the Panthers a
week off last week, but they were
back at practice this Monday,
working on the fine points of their
game.

“We’ve been working on our all-
around game," said Reilly. “We’ve
also been working on individual
skills.

“Our mental game is still weak. ‘-

We’ve been having hard practices
to work on that.”

A PIANO PLAYER WITH SAD
BROWN EYES

Allegheny Reportory Theatre

take an established Broadway or
West End hit and mount a successful
production two, ten, or fifty years
after the fact. An original play is a

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING
EARNEST -
Point Park College Theatre
Company

BY JANE HOLAHAN

Oscar Wilde is the father of the
modern theatre and his most charm-
ing and enduring offspring, The Impor-
tance of Being Earnest remains, late in the
20th century an amusing and urbane
play. It's hard to imagine this play as
innovative, yet its phenomenal suc-
cess in 1895 opened the way for the
witty drawing room comedies that

are synonymous with the 20th

century. - _
Still, there is something a bit old

fast" ied and rusty about the Point

Park College Theatre Company's

‘Dproduction, which on the one hand

gives the play a static feeling, and on
the other adds a bit of rustic charm to
the evening. After all this IS Oscar
Wilde.

Basically a comedy of errors, with
caustic ironies about British society
at the twilight of the Victorian era

INDIANS
New City Theatre Company
By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE

Arthur Kopit's Indianslis a monster
of a play, a great roaring black beast

of a play that sweeps epically from

the show-biz pizzazz of Buffalo Bill's
Wild West Show to the stark reality
of the massacre at Wounded Knee. It
is no undertaking for amateurs, or
even professionals if their talents are
not formidable ones.

Fortunately, there is formidable
talent in the New City Theatre Com-
pany, as Marc Masterson’s produc-
tion of Indians eloquently bears out.

As usual, the production trades
heavily on the superb acting gifts of
Larry John Meyers and Michael

'QCook. The role of Buffalo Bill is par-

ticularly challenging, requiring. the
actor to project both the unwittingly
destructive Wild West Show persona
of the man, and also the confused and
sensitive humanity that lies under-

neath it. Meyers is.electrifyiI18lY 5"‘-’» ‘-

ditferert animal; the risk factor is
enormously higher, but so are the
potential rewards.

With the exception of Mel Shapi-
ro's New Plays Festival at CMU,
there are few places in Pittsburgh to
see this process in action. KUDOS,
therefore, to Allegheny Repertory
Theatre's producers Melanie Verlin
and David Marchick for bringing us
F.J. Hartland's A Piano Player With Sad
Brown Eyes, opening simultaneously
here and in an Off-Broadway
production.

Piano Player is about three sisters
who meet at their father's house just
after his funeral. Vanessa is a suc-
cessful writer of trivial Harlequin-
type romances, and a timid

thrown in for flavor, The Importance of
Being Earnest loses a lot of its fun
simply because the timely jokes don't
make too much sense in 1982. Point
Park has given it a straightforward
production which is quite serviceable,
but not very exciting. The main rea-
son it works is the cast, and the eter-
nal wit of Wilde.

Even so, too much of the play
depends on a constant verbal barrage,
which gets tired after a while, and
very wobbly. Much of the meander-
ing middle could have been cut, and
the actors could have talked a little
slower at times. The setting could
have been a little more professional
looking too (for a second there I
thought there I thought [was in my
high school auditorium).

What sparks this play is the cast,
which is delightful all around. There

child-woiiian who prefers the fairy-
tale world of her books to reality.
Nicole runs a greeting card company
in Colorado which prints her artsy-
fartsy poems, and is a veritable bitch
on wheels. Jacqueline, the eldest, is an
unpublished novelist who is uncom-
promising about art and is hiding as a
writer teacher in a women's college in
Omaha.

Hartland is fortunate in having the
rock-solid direction of Brian Patrick
Sullivan and a splendid cast of three
very talented young women to real-
ize his script. They are Cynthia Nel-
son (Vanessa), Marti Donovan
(Jacqueline), and Leslie K. Armen-
trout (Nicole), and they play off one
another with the sensitivity of sur-
geons probing for a tumor. Their per-
formances alone would make the trip
to {.3 the theatre worthwhile.

Sadly, the weakest link in the pro-
duction is Hartland's script itself. He

more charming than bothersome,

the grand dame Lady Bracknell, who
is opposed to her daughter Gwen-
dolen (Diane Jones) marrying John
Worthing (Kirk Holtzinger) because
he was found in Victorian Station in a

cessful; the man's soul stares out of
his intensely blue eyes. Cook plays
Sitting Bull with dignity, imagina-

tion, and great power. The rest ofthe
cast is almost uniformly good, no
mean achievement when you con-
sider its size. There are standout per-
formances by Ken Milchick as Wild
Bill Hickock, Dan Large as the Grand
Duke, John Hall as John Grass, and
Holly Thuma as Teskanjavila.

W» -Tony Ferrieri’s set is»a masterful '

\ ,

piece of work. Not only does it cap-
ture the overall feeling of the play, it
manages to convert the tiny playing
space of the New City Theatre into a

literal arena for the huge cast.

Indians, like almost all art, is not
without its flaws, however. The pro-
duction occasionally loses momen-

- tum, particularly in scene changes

there are sparks onstage. When they
don't, the acting and directing go a
long way toward hiding the flaws.

Yet ultimately, Hartland shows us
nothing really new. His themes ("the
failure to communicate," "love is hard
to find," and ”after all, we've only got
one another, so PLEASE let's love
each other") are the familiar ones of
American realistic family drama, and
there is nothing fresh about their
presentation in Piano Player. On the
positive side, his characters have sub-
stance and guts, and he succeeds in
making us care about them.

Director Sullivan's set effectively
projects the personality of the dead
father, making him almost a fourth
character in the play, while lighting
designer Joe Abeln’s work is compe-
tent but uneven.

Senators also are the only characters
in modern dress, but the mikes mal-
function half of the time anyway, and

the lost time is not justified by the
inconsistent effect.

Similarly, the director chose to cast
the President as a midget. Again, the
notion is sound; but despite the fact
that Gary J. Leventhal clearly tries
valiantly, he is simply not an actor.

Finally, though, the minor nitpicks
are overwhelmed by the power and
beauty of the production. What is sig-
nificant about Indians is not that a few
things are wrong, but that so much of
it is RIC-HT. It is a staggering
achievement, and it reaches deeply
into the minds and hearts of its
audience.

Looking back, it becomes obvious
that Cannery Row peaked way too
early;

Welch got canned from her role as
Suzy and was replaced by Urban
Cowgirl Debra (she looks good on a
mechanical bull) Winger and the
whole mess resulted in lawsuits, free
publicity, a feature in Rolling Stone,
and, oh yes—-a movie.

Cannery Row has been adapted from
the 1945 John Steinbeck novel of the
same name and its 1954 sequel Sweet
Thursday. Screenplay and direction
belong to David 5. Ward, best known
for the screenplay of The Sting. The
for the screenplay of The Sting. The Row,
as it is affectionately called, rests
amid the post-depressive shores of
northern California. Once _a thriving
maze of sardine cannaries and dis-
tributors, ”the row" has dwindled to a
playground for the lovable misfits of
Steinbeck’s two novels. ’

Amongst the whores and brown-
baggers we find Doc (Nick Nolte), an
ex-major league hurler turned
marine biologist who, we are told, has
come to this abyss to write ”a paper”
of sorts. It could be the weak script or
it could be the trauma of having
Raquel Welch depart before the fun
starts, but Nolte never captures the
slightly bitter, eccentric loner Stein-
beck had writteﬁ of. On the other
hand, Winger tries too hard to act her
way through a part that, considering
Welch’s casting, required little sub-
tlety, just plenty of toothy ”how’s

this?” posing. Nice try Debra, but

Something has gone wrong with
George and Faith Dunlop's marriage
and neither one knows exactly what
it is. There is a nagging ambivalance
in the dissolution of their marriage,
dragging both of them and their four
daughters into a confusing and pain-
ful tug of war. Shoot The Moon goes
beyond the cliche of ”I can't live with
you and I can't live without you” into
a darker and deeper world; into the
ambiguity of no man's land.

Middle class America is often por-
trayed as emotionally bankrupt in
films (Ordinary People, and much of
Kramer Vs. Kramer show people with-
out the ability to feel) but Shoot The
Moon does not allow such easy dilem-
mas to infiltrate it because those
dilemmas can be worked out. The _
problems in Shoot The Moon are middle
class, but they do not involve the
shortcomings of WASP culture. They

human being, and go far beyond

The Dunlops (Albert Finney and

Diane Keaton) have lived a good por-
tion of their lives together, raising
four daughters in a nice, big house
outside of San Francisco. But as the
film opens the obvious difficulties in
their marriage have reached the boil-
ing point, and they decide to separate.
George has made it easy for himself
by finding a mistress (well played by
Karen Allen) thus using ”the other
woman” as his excuse to dissolve the
marriage. But it is evident that their
problems go far beyond George's
adultery.

Bo Goldman's script is funny, often
articulate and often as inarticulate as
any marriage in trouble can be. Their
problems are never really spelled out,

family life, and the stunning perfor-
mances of Finny and Keaton supply

catch the next raft, for this Titantic is
headed for the rocks.

Instead of hinting to the despera-
tion of Steinbeck’s characters and
then revelling in‘ their reckless antics,
Ward simply parades people out onto
Richard McDonald's dreamy set say-
ing ”yeah you gotta do this.” No
wonder Raquel slept in mornings!

Doc and Suzy hit it off so badly that
you know they have fallen in love;
but, if put in the right hands, a nostal-
gic romance might have emerged.
Instead, Ward clumsily drags us
through scenes of cutesy slapstick
and hollow attempts at emotion that
leave you asking: ”did this guy ha\Le__
something to do with The San Pedro

.Beac_h Bums? Of little help are lack

Nitzsche's tawdry score or John’

Houston's unnecessary and melodra-
matic narration.

Cannery Row could have easily been
retitled Monterey‘ R.F.D., given its
Fisher Price texture and the cast of
Mayberry’s finest; Nolte, the boy
scout sheriff Andy, Winger as his
lame dame Lu-Anne, Audra Lindley
as the local bordello’s own Aunt Bea,
and a gaggle of raffish bums ready to
sleep one off a la Otis Campbell.

Cannery Row decays ’til all that
remains are Sven Nykvist's pastel
backdrops—a composition of ”starv—
ing artists" seascapes that decorate
the theatre. By scraping Cannery Row
of all its crustiness, Ward has dipped
an empty cone into the jimmies, leav-
ing nothing to hold onto and enjoy.

   

just enough image to make a strong
mood piece. This is a slice of middle

class life, making few judgments and
fewer assumptions.

Albert Finney gives the finest per- '

formance of his long career, even sur-
passing the inarticulate angry young
man of Saturday Night, Sunday Morning
that made him a star. He wants out of
his marriage, but not out of his fam-
ily. The complexity of the situation
grows when his eldest daughter
Sherry (Dana Hill) refuses to forgive
him for leaving her mother. The
desire to remain close to his daugh-
ters of course closely interweaves
with his difficulties in leaving his
wife; the guilt, the happiness he's
found with another woman, the feel-
ing of failure, and the basic love and
jealousy he still feels for and from his
wife; Finney catches all of this in his~=
performance without ever overdoing
it.
Diane Keaton finally proves that
she is a great actress by getting_rid of
her Annie Hall la-di-das, which have

 

’oN 

 

often hurt her performances, and
making Faith~a strong woman, devoid
of the chic insecurities and immersed

in her four busy, loud and energetic
daughters, yet facing life very much
alone. Keaton allows the audience to
empathize with her by occasionally

being sentimental, but in a real and
natural way. She makes Jill Clay-
burgh’s unmarried woman look like
cotton candy.

The explosive aspects of Shoot The
Moon (Finney smashes the front door
at one point) give the film a danger-
ous edge, but are quite refreshing
compared to the sterility of many
"WASP” films. The Dunlop's don't
lack the ability to communicate, what

1

it



they do lack remains unexplainable-‘C-v

and incomprehensible. Shoot the Moon
may be a depressing film, but it
breathes more realistically than any
other movies that claim to be speak-
ing the truth about middle class
America today.

All Wally seems to be able to think
about lately is money. He is an unsuc-
cessful actor and even more unsuc-
cessful playwright who has guilt
feelings about living off of his girl-
friend. Andre on the other hand, is
very successful and never seems to
lack money. He is a man that Wally
has been trying to avoid for quite
some time. But now at the insistence
of a friend he finds himself on the
way to dinner with Andre. The even-
ing, he believes will not be very inter-
esting, but fortunately he is wrong.

My Dinner With Andre is a film Wally
and Andre's encounter. Little more
than conversation takes place» in this
film and, except for a few scenes at

the beginning and end of the film, it
takes place entirely in a New York
restaurant. It is quite an unusual film

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

It could have been a clinker—-a real
catastrophe even. But, somehow it

works. Don't give up yet on Peter

Bogdanovich, because if he can take a

movie as potentially bad as They All
Laughed and turn it into something
worth seeing, who knows what he
could do with really good material.
Save for A! Long Last Love (Certainly
one of the all-time worst movies ever
made), Bogdanovich has always man-
aged to coax good performances out
of actors—-performances that were
often better than the movies them-
selves. Paper Moon, for example, was a

 "nice ”little" movie, but it was Tatum

O'Neal’s character who made it a
roaring success. His latest effort, They
All Laughed continues this tradition; a
horrendous story line is spared a
quick death by the wonderful actors

whose innovation lies not in its film-
ing technique nor in the ideas
expounded by the two principles, but
in the belief that 110 minutes of
dinner conversation can be entertain-_
ing. Unlikely, yes, but surprisingly it
works. The authors, Wallace Shawn
and Andre Gregory, who also play
the principle roles, stipulated to
director Louis Malle that no flash-
backs or any similar devices be used.

They wanted all of the imagery to
take place in the viewers heads. It is a
rather unprecedented idea in light of
the fact that film is a visual medium.
But there is something in watching
the speaker's hand motions and
expressionswas he conveys his ideas
and experiences that stimulates the

imagination. And, likewise, it is inter-
esting to watch the expressions of the
listener and ‘his reactions.

who weave in and out of it.

As he's done in his other pictures,
Bogdanovich uses several unknowns
in leading roles——something he has a
knack for (remember Madelaine
Kahn in What's Up Doc? Cybil She-
pherd in The Last Picture Show?) And
he's really outdone himself this time
around—the unknowns nearly steal
the show away from biggies like Aud-
rey Hepburn and Ben Gazzara. Col-
leen Camp, Blaine Novak, and Patti
Hansen all seem to have bright
futures ahead in the acting world if
their performances in They All Laugh-
ted are any indication of what they're
capable of.

As the author of the screenplay, as
well as its director, Bogdanovich
must take the blame for the picture's
biggest drawback, too: the story
itself, a rather incoherent one about
detectives who follow rich men's

..,...., H

Their conversation begins with
Andre telling of his very unusual
experiences in his travels through
Poland, Scotland, India, and other
places. He describes experiences that
have been enlightening and have
changed his perceptions in some way;
in one he vividly describes having
been buried alive. From there Andre
moves into his philosophical views of
modern existence. And it is here that

Wally must stand in defense of the
common man whose main concern is
to pay the rent, but who can enjoy the
few comforts that he has, such as an
electric blanket on a cold» winter
night. But Andre believes life has
become too mechanical and as these
comforts become more and more eas-
ily attainable they put one out of
touch with the real world. They are
like tranquillizers. But Wally still

wives, trying to catch them in liasons,
but who usually fall in love with them
instead. Sounds more like the plot to
a Don Knotts-Tim Conway comedy
than to the sophisticated comedy it
half-succeeds in being.

Ben Gazzara is a detective who
works for the sam.e agency as John
Ritter and Blaine Novak, but who is
at least a rank or two above them,
probably due to his seniority or their
ineptness. He's assigned to follow
Audrey Hepburn, the wife of a
wealthy businessman, and, as
expected, he falls in love with her.
John Ritter is watching dorthy Strat-
ten (the ex Playmate of the Year who
was murdered last year), the beauti-
ful young wife of another rich man
and —-—you guessed it——he falls in love
with her, too. In the meantime,
Blaine Novak, falls in love and fools

around with just about anythingthat ‘

 

wants his electric blanket.

It is certainly Andre who holds the
stronger argument, but ultimately
there is no reconcilliation of the two
positions. This is apparentlydue to
Wally’s lack of options. The only
thing he can see to rely on is the small
comforts. But despite his steadfast-
ness Wally has somehow been
changed by this conversation. Riding
home in a taxi he perceives things
more readily. Memories come back to
him more easily.

This is where the power of the film
lies. Like Andre questioning the sen-
sibilities of the common man, the film
questions the sensibilities and per-
ceptions of the viewers by asking us
to sit through a film of nothing more
than a dinner conversation. And if
one will listen, it may not change the‘
perceptions of life but it will leave one

anyone wants to admit that an image
is really all that important, the fact is
that up until now it has been a major
factor in the breaking of new artists

By now, it's becoming obvious
who's the outspoken member of the‘
Switchboard, and, more than likely,
the unofficial leader of the band as
well. On stage, Robert is like apuppet

As’ for the so-called "glamor"of the

his favorite thing to do, but the pro-

from the flurry of activity_in the cen-

momentarily to take care of business.

very much like brothers: Bernard, the
big, protective one, and Nile, of
medium build, just a shade under
Bernard's 5'9” frame, his smoother
speech befitting his style of guitar
playing.

What did Edwards and Rogers do
before they went into music? They
had to make a living some other.way
before cranking out (that is, writing
and producing) hits for Diana Ross,

"Hi, Bernard," says Charles,- throw-
ing his head back, laughing. He con-
veys the thought that he's got
Bernard covered. Bernard under-
stands perfectly, and as Nile trades a
few. words on wardrobe with Cha-
rles, steps are again taken in the
direction of Room #3. Bernard asks
Luci what she's wearing, she tells him
white, as she stands over a quilted
ironing board wearing a short, risquel
red tutulmini dress and dark, bul
leg warmers rolled down below h
calves, offering a view of her cra
legs that none of the wild menfollq§aa'

move on to Room #3 for a talk with
the co—founders of the dance band
Chic, bassist Bernard Edwards and
guitarist Nile Rogers.

them; our strerijgth is in our rhythm
section: me, Nile, and Tony (Thomp-
son, the drummer). There's that sim-
ilarity, sure. But, hey, man, we ain't
punks."

Nile stood in the threshold of the
doorway, wearing a sharp wool over-
coat that he hadn't had the chance to
take off. His tweed sport coat, shirt
and tie were all in place. At times, Nile
was the silent conversation in our
conversation. filling in just the gaps

for themselves. During the 70's,
when pop music was under the full-
scale assault of disco, Chic burned
hard with "Dance, Dance, Dance,"
"Freak Out," and "Good Times.” In all
silliness, Edwards claims once aspir-
ing to work the rest of his life as a
mailman in his and Nile's native
N.Y.C. Nile admits to being a "profes-
sional bum." He,’ too, believes in kid-

they're going to be saying, ‘Hey, man,

THE FINGERPRINTZ
Decade
February 18, 1982

By STEVEN HORWITZ

I arrived at the Decade with a
couple friends around 11:30.
People were gathered around
the bar drinking and whatnot,
enjoying the company of friends
and strangers. lstepped into the
dimly-lit back room where the
chatter was loud and everyone
seemed up for the show.

Soon, the band's manager
began adjusting the board while
one of the crew members tested
the microphones and taped the
last wire to the floor. The gui-
tars were brought out and
within five minutes out came

 

 

 

Fingerprintz.
Immediately, chairs shuffled
toward the stage as the eyes of

the band members met the
audience's gaze. Dressed in
1940's clothes styles (baggy
wool pants, suspenders, Bogart-
styled sports coats, etc.) the
band jumped into a quick-paced
heavy-beat song from their first
album entitled Fingerprintz. The
beat captivated two girls and
they began to dance attracting
people from the other room
who rushed in to ‘catch the beat.
By the third song everyone was
either dancing, tapping his foot,
or squirming in his chair.

The band members let the
audience know their active
response was greatly appre-
ciated and even exhilarating. In
fact, Iimme O'Neill, the lead

vocalist, broke into a bit of
theatrics as the other members
pursued their instruments with
great enthusiasm. The other
band members include Kenny
Alton on bass, Cha Burnz play-
ing the whirlybird and rhythm
guitars, Bogdan Wiczling keep-
ing the drumbeat, and Steve
King pressing the keyboards.
The first four songs were off
of Fingerprintz and the second
album, Distinguishing Marks. The
songs dealt with violence and
detective themes and,,were
designed as ”sequel" songs from
the new album Beat Nair were
followed with other songs
intermittently spaced between
the catchy up-beat rhythms.
These songs were varied with
the perfect combination of ligh-
ter songs to allow all a chance to

Finger?

grab some air and a hit of beer.

As the night wore on, the
crowd danced around as though
they were magnets of equal
polarity repelling each other

across the dance floor. Eve-
ryone was having a-good time
and being unusually friendly——
the guy next to me kept offering
me and my friends beer as we all
danced and perspired together.
Fingerprintz finally closed the
show to a boisterous audience
yelling for more. After a couple
of minutes, the band ascended
the stage for four more songs
that sent everyone into a frenzy
of excitement and dance. The
fourth song came to an end with
everyone in the room drenched

in sweat and the band saying  

thanks and good night—and a
good night it was, indeed.

 

IOAN IETTITHE ADULTS
Heaven
(February 17, 1982

STEVEN HORWITZ

From the time people began
to fill Heaven until the very end
of the show the excitement of
rock-n-roll filled the air—a cer-
tain type of rock-n-roll-Joan Jett
rock-n-roll.

Heaven, the location of the
concert, warrants a description.
This marble palace is a dream
away from all dreams equipped
with a sound system compara-
ble to any good music hall.

Walking in on any given day,

A one finds himself in a barrage of

colorful, glistening clothing and
the sparkle of jewelry catches
the eye. Chic hairstylesfrom
New York and abroad are pre-
valent as well as the sporting
American styles. From there,

one notices the various forms ’

and colors of light that play off
of peoples’ expressions, provid-
ing a wonderland for thirsty
minds and bodies. The entire
scenario is like a wild fantasy
party that often finds one slip-

ping behind a social mask or

confronting the unreal straight
on.

The above description, how-
ever, was not to be seen this
night. Much of the colorful clo-
thing and fancy jewelry was
replaced by leather jackets and
pants coupled with bandanas or
scarves. The night truly
belonged to raunch-n-roll.

The Adults, a Cleveland-based
band, opened the show with a
variety of punk-influenced
dance songs providing an outlet
for stored—up energy. The band
played a mixture of songs with a

wide range of tempos and beats
which eventually had people

swinging and swaying to the

pulsating beats. The band
members were exciting to
watch and appeared truly com-
mitted to getting people to
dance. But after awhile, the
audience became restless and
began to call for Joan Jett. I, too,
found myself getting tired of
the solid-beat tempos and was
ready to hear the main
attraction.

The Blackhearts were first on D
the darkenedstage with loan
Iett following close behind.
After a moment of adjusting the
equipment, lights flooded the
stage to the beginning drum
beat of ”Doing All Right with
the Boys.”

Dressed in a hideous lavendar
T-shirt and K-Mart type sneak-
ers, Iett bellowed out the words
to several of the songs off her
first album, Bad Reputation. The”
audience seemed unknowledge-
able of the material but jumped
to the beat anyway. Eventually,
the enthusiam simmered until
the beginning chordsjof ”Crim-
son and Clover” rang through-
out the room, rejuvenating the
audience into dancing peo-
ploids; in fact, "Crimson and
Clover", a remake, received the
largest response up until that
point. Unlike the earlier songs,
this song was crisp and tight,
dismissing the coarseness of
]ett's rough-edged voice. The
bassist (Gary Ryan) and lead-
guitarist (Ricky Byrd) took
turns traversing the stage,
often placing their guitars over
or close to people in the front
row. Arms and hands reached
out at hopes of producing a note
that did not belong in the song. '

 

ACKHEAR T5

The band progressed through
a few more songs which all
ended in a crashing halt. Sud-
denly, Joan gave ajtongue in
cheek motion and asked the
audience if they knew what she
_likes. This brought various
shouts and moans from the
crowd, an appropriate response
and one to be expected. Iett
smirked, then screeched
(nothing unique to the even-
ing), ‘'1 like alot of things but I
L——O——V——E rock-n-roll!” after
which the band jumped full
force into the upbeat single. The
audience went wild and sang
along with the band sounding
better than Iett herself. Follow-
ing, the band covered more
material from the two albums
and closed the show shortly
after. But the show wasn't over
(unfortunately).

on stage breaking into other
artists’ songs. The closing
number was }ett's horrendous
and degrading version of David
Bowie's "Rebel Rebel”. Such a
night with Joan Iett and the

Blackhearts-—something old,”

much borrowed, but obviously
nothing really new.

Hall and John Oates could have
done as the others and played
the Philadelphia, Cleveland, the
hell with Pittsburgh circuit, but
chose instead to pay us a visit.

  ‘I

The duo could have easily

filled the cavernous Civic Are-
- na’s theatre style set—up yet

they were booked into the Stan-,
ley, giving us a«rare glimpse of
rock ’n roll up close. In return,
Hall and Oates made use of the
theatre's impeccable acoustics
by giving the sell-out crowd a
shot of rhythm and blues not
soon to be forgotten.

Their set opened with the
soon-to-be-released single "Did
It In A Minute” and immediately

I could feel a new found confi-
dence in the music. The duo
from Philadelphia have paid
their dues on many small hall,
small town, and small pay-day
tours but this show, the first of
the tour,I marked an adieu to
those leaner days. The irony of
the o'pener’s title may have

’ wentundetected by the crowd
but it shone through Hall's

matinee grin—-"it's been a long

ride, but we've made ituhome."

Responses picked up during
the fourth song "Rich Girl,"
which lost its bitter edge in
favor of Hall's electric piano and
a more melodious swing. "She's
Gone" showcased noted ses-
sionman G.E.Smith, who was
somehow lured out on tour des-
pite his great demand in the stu-
dio. Smith was brilliant,
carrying his lead around the
stage with a strut and snarl
reminiscent of Frank Gorshin's
"Riddler" character.

The No. 1 pop smash "Kiss
On My List” and the multi-
charted (pop, soul, disco, rock) "I
Can't Go For That (No Can
Do)" followed and were well-
received, yet it was a departure
from the hit parade that
brought the crowd off its feet. A
string of oldies used to intro-
duce the band ignited the some-
what older crowd into a frenzy.
"Guitarist Smith, bassist ‘Tom
Wolk, drummer Mickey Curry,
and‘ saxophonist Charlie
DeChant doled _out solo after
solo during the medley which
contained Smokey Robinson's
"Going to a Go-Go," Wilson

Pickett’s "Funky B.roadway"and
fragments of "Ooh Poo Pah

D00" and "Wipeout.”

Daryl Hall sustained the
intensity with a version of "Sara
Smile” that far surpassed the

vinyl effort. Hall's torching'

vocal transformed the cursory
ballad into a bitter challenge.
Then, rising from the stage

floor, Hall answered with the ‘

plea of "Wait For Me" which,_

judging from the screams, was
what every girl wanted to hear.
Next came ”Private Eyes" and
”You've Lost That Loving Feel-
ing," hit singles- number...well
who's counting! Two encores
later and Hall and Oates had laid
one of their best down_in the
Stanley's log. '
Theibig-time and all of its_gli_t-

DONNIE IRISITHE IRON
cmr HOUSEROCKERS
Youngstown Agora

February 14. 1982

By FRANK DIGIACOMO
The place was packed. The
unemployed were out en mass

» tonight——sort of like night of
_the living dead in Youngstown.

There haven't been this many
people here since the day before
thesteel mills closed.

As the Houserockers took the

 arkened stage they were
V reeted with some handsome

applause. At center stage, Joe
Grushecky, in his terminal
striped crewneck and beard,
looked like an economy-sized

_ Pete Townshend as he walked

to the microphone and shouted
out the three numbers that
drew the rest of the band into
"Friday Night." Immediately it
became evident that the House-
rockers had been dealt another
bad break. The sound mix was
horrendously muddied and
Grushecky’s vocals were
walked all over by the instru-
ments. Consequently, the lyri-
cal fire of such songs as "Saints
and Sinners" and "This Time
(The Night Won't Save US)"
were lost somewhere between
the monitors and the mixing

‘board. Nonetheless the House-

rockers put forth a very com-
mendable effort as they
immersed themselves into what
was a rather short set that con-
sisted largely of songs from

Donnie Iris' night. As the Cruis-
ers’ instruments were set up the
Agora seemed to become even

p more crowded. The multitudes

consisted of everyone from
your local bikerlhood type to
the middle-aged CPA/prep-

clone but they all had one thing

in common: they were really
exuberant about seeing Donnie
Iris. I haven't seen this much
spirit since "Beach Blanket

 

Donniefris °°"«-° Cruisers

Bingo."

When the lights went up and
the Cruisers pranced onstage
the crowd lost it. Iris and band
absorbed this immense energy
and fed itback to the audience in

musical form. The band opened
with "Agnes" and "That's The
Way Love Ought To Be" in per-
fect form. "The Cruisers were

‘formance with the greatest

improvement being in guitarist
Marty Lee. Iris seemed to be
quite conservative in his sing-
ing, never really aiming for
those high sustaining falsettoes
that are characteristic of his
voice. It didn't matter though as
the crowd loved every minute of
his performance.

Iris’ stage manner is mag-
netic. He exudes an electrical

exuberance that infects the-

entire audience. He doesn't
separate himself from the
crowd, constantly shaking their
ha_nds and even bringing several
up on stage to sing "Back on the
Streets.” Iris’ enthusiasm is a
tangible entity: you can actually
see it_ on his face.

The band's set consisted of
material from both of Iris’
albums with the majority being
from the King Cool album. The
highlight of the evening was
’’Love Is Like A Rock" in which
Iris and keyboardist Mark Avsec
donned guitars to perform a
mega-decibel version to the
ecstatic crowd.

The only real flaws of the
show were some of the over-
used tactics that Iris has been
employing since last year. These
included the exact same intro to
"I Can't Hear You"; a simped
out guitar solo by Marty Allen
(he's too good for schlock like
this); and a B-O-R-I-N-Gidrum
solo by Kevin Valentine.

WASN'T TOMORROW
WONDERFUL?

The Waitresses

Polydor

The lure of the flirtatious girl
has long been at the center of
the adolescent riddle. Rock's
latest trend in female vocalists
has revamped that lure for
these less chivalrous times and
have been selling records at a
furious pace. This new
Coquette-set began the surge
into America's lunch money
quietly in the pre-Parallel Lines
Blondie days and have since pro-
duced some of the best music
(from Chrissie Hynde's impu-

‘ dent ”Brass In Pocket" to the

saucy Go-Go's’ Beauty And The
Beat to-Joan Jett's hit single ’’I
Love Rock’n Roll”) of these
rather scant times.

With Wasn't Tomorrow Wonder-
ful? The Waitresses have
brought rock's female expres-
sionsfull circle all the way from

Sncx THE KNIFE

Nick Lowe
Columbia

This album should be good.
With three-quarters of Rockpile
and special guests (from
Squeeze, The Attractions),
excellent production, and Lowe
writinglcowriting all the songs,
one_ would,expect to discover
some interesting lightweight
pop tunes. But after thorough
listening, catchy melodies are
spare and rare. Sure, there are
melodies but the songs tend to
run into each other; in one ear
and out the other. Lowe, noted
for producing les notables Pre--
tenders, Elvis Costello, et al,
puts the bass and drums up
front. The harmonies are good
and expected, yet they're overly
repetitious. Even though the
songs are short, the interest
level drifts frequently. Listen-
ing to the same instrument -

styleithree chord progressions
throughout the album will even
put the most dedicated fan or
listener in misery. When Lowe
has to experiment with a reggae
version of ”Heart” on the
album, he must be short on
material. Desperate is more like
it. That's too bad, though,
because he has written some
outstanding rock-n-roll songs.
There's no ”Cruel to Be Kind,”
"So It Goes,” or ”Switchboard
Susan" since this is no Pure Pop
for Now People or Labour of Lust.
Diversity is the’ reason why
Rockpile's Seconds of Pleasure
worked and why Rockpile
didn't. The goofy words and
stupid titles don't help either.
"Burning" opens the album
with its primal drumming and
steals side one easily. As for

’'Heart”, well the rock-n-roll P '

version is better. Nice try any-

  .-.~wsxt:Nisk-”.St§c1s...It.-Whers    

The Big Bopper’s ”Chantilly
Lace” with a boldness in attack,
yet a.-retreat to the suffragette’s
first «ripples. The six member
group from the Cleveland-
Akron band factory was formed
by guitarist/producer/song-
writer Chris Butler. Butler's
acute and quirky writing has a
vicarious affinity with lead sin-

ger Patty Donahue that bends

Sun Don't Shine” and "Zulu
Kiss” stand out after awhile.
Trash like ”Couldn’t Love You”
and "Raining, Raining" slip into
sappy Simon and Garfunkel
IJames Taylor crooning. ”Ba
Doom" and ”Queen of Sheba”
are what is known as album
filler which the entire record
suffers from.

«The rest of the disc slides
quickly by without even notic-
ing. But, look at it this way: this
album is definitely better than
the junk DVE plays. (Shows you
how bad FM hasgot.)

Sixties refugees and die-
hard] can't-get-enough! Lowe
fans might take a liking to this
album since the production is
superb. Nick Lowe is one of the
best producers in rock-n-roll
today, but these songs are lack-
ing.. Well, back to producing we
go...

QUESTIONAIRE
Chas Jankel
A & M

Chas Jankel, late of Ian Dury
and The Blockheads, calls him-
self a musical architect. Consid-
ering that along with writing all
the music Jankel lists vocals,
guitars, piano, percussion,
sound effects, and the mixing
among his duties on this, his
second album, you might allow
him the rather pretentious title.
Questionnaire employs such
bizarre instruments as an Ober-
heim Programming Micro-
composer and Go-Go bells-
this is not a run-of-the-mill
album! Put your money back in
your wallet, this isn't a very
good album, either.

Donahue conveys the lyrical wit
in such a starkly understated
way that before you can recoil,
her web has been spun.

Just as important here is that
behind this tactful duo lies a
rock ’n roll band that no doubt

catches a fresh approach to funk
music in a mid-creative genious.
The A side of this experimen-
tal material fulfills its hypothe-
sis. ”3,000,000 Synths," which
has already hit No. 1 on the
disco charts, is an orchestrated
blitz of synthesizers that beau-
tifully pulse in and out in a gal-
atical movement. ”Magic of
Music" exudes a raggae feel
inside of which Jankel’s some-
times weak vocals are more
suitably mixed. "Glad To Know
You"'relieson a calypso beat and
a more active bass line to sup-
port Jankel who simply is not a
singer. "Boy" is the only tune
Jankel can carry and that's
because he raps his way
through it.

night???

Just when you thought that
there was nothing decent to put
on the stereo, Polydor comes
out with this compilation of
Siouxsie and The Banshees
material. If you're not familiar
with their music, this is the per-
fect package to acquaint you
with their bizarre brand of pop-

made this project possible: witty
lyrics do not get record execu-
tives all that attentive. Musical
comparisons lead us to Blondie’s
Plastic Letters or maybe portions
of The English Beat’s I ]ust Can't
Stop It, but ultimately the sound
of The Waitresses belongs to
Donahue’s conversational
taunts.

The best cuts off of Wasn't

Tomorrow Wonderful? drift amidst
Butler's pent up arrangements
giving Donahue the reign she
needs to indulgently pout. ”No
Guilt” gently scoffs at an ex-
boyfriend to "save it—l'm sorry I
don't feel awful/It wasn't the end ofthe
world." For nuances, ”lt’s My
Car" jaunts with big band salsa,
while the single ’’I Know What
Boys Like” (now in its third
release) unravels a funky dia-
logue between Donahue’s
spoiled siren and the scratchy
guitar and sax of the band.

As a debut, Wasn't Tomorrow
Wonderful? has to be commended
for both classy production and
its daring tendencies. Donahue
will probably extend herself
vocally on later efforts and for
now I" can live with the splotches
where her whining grows thin.
The Waitresses seem to move
one step backward and two
leaps forward, but the ambi-
guity is necessary for the bolder
paths they've chosen to take.

them, this is still worth buying

since you probably couldn't
afford to buy all of their albums
(all imports), anyway. Included
here are all of their major sin-
gles released overseas from mid
1978 through he summer of
1981 including "Hong Kong
Garden," ”Love In A Void,"

‘ ”Staircase," ”Happy House,"

”Christine," and ”Israel" among
others. .
Nobody‘sings or writes like
Siouxsie and The Banshees—
originality is their forte—but if

The diverse collection of bands
range from Whitford-St:

spunky Holly and The Italians.

Columbia took the best of
their recently signed artists and
put two or three of their good
songs on these albums. Out-

BLUE MASK
Lou Reed
RCA

Mediocrity is alive and well
and living in Lou Reed's latest
release. This poet cum rock-n-
roller seems to have temporar-
ily (I hope) lost his fire or
straightened out his life or
something.

The Blue Mask, Reed's latest
effort, is a pretty tame one at
that, and seems to be lacking the
cynicism, depression, and
depravity that once made him

. the Sylvia Plath of Rock.

‘album is the lyrics. Whereas

‘me.

The main weakness of this

Reed's lyrics are typically sca-
thing and/or haunting; many of
Blue A/Iaslc's songs are comprimis-
ing (for the sake of a rhyme),
tedious, and yes, even naive.
Reed, being a poet at heart, is
one of the few songwriters
whose lyrics can stand without
a protective blanket of music;
yet on this album, cuts like
"Women," "Underneath The
Bottle," and "Heavenly Arms"
(a song for Sylvia Reed) just
don't cut it without the hyp-
notic distractions of Reed's

veintricate guitar stylings. Even

"My House," an epitaph/trib-
ute to Delmore Schwartz, lacks
the spontaneity Lou Reed used
to characterize.

Nonetheless, The Blue A/llI.‘§l('
does contain some notable
material. "Average Guy" is
amusing and reminiscent of
"NY Telephone Conversation,"
”The Day John Kennedy Died”
is a touching statement while
”Waves of Fear" comes very
close to becoming onomato-
poeia of itself. However, the

 of the album is the title cut, I
I’ “he Blue Mask." This song's

violent S&M theme and cut-
throat guitar work immediately
brings back fond memories of
the Velvet Underground, spe-
cifically ”Shiny Boots of
Leather.” This tune is definitely
the darkness in the midst of the

tunnel.
This may be a harsh thing to

say, but Lou Reed needs a little
more pain and suffering in his
life. His music always seemed to
be at its best while he was
enduring the loss of his first

IN GOD'WE TRUST
The Dead Kennedys
Faulty

Dear Mom & Dad,

How's everything? I got your
letter yesterday with the
Christmas photos——that picture
of Grandma and Grandpa
dressed as elves is really hysteri-
call How's old Rover? I sure do
miss taking him for walks.

And I really miss you two,
also. But I've found something
to keep me occupied so that I
don't miss home too much. It's
this new album by a band called
The Dead Kennedys and it's
really ‘great! It has all these
really good songs on it--my
favorite is ”Nazi Punks Fuck
Off," but ”Religious Vomit”and
”Dog Bite" are almost as good.
See, the thing I really like about
them is that their lyrics really
mean something. I mean, I'll
always like Manilow, but the
Kennedys write about really
relevant things——Reagan, the
Moral Maiority, chemical con-
tamination; I mean, just read
these lyrics: "All religions mnlce me
wanna throw up//ill religions mnlre
me sirlc//ill religions make me UHYYZHII
throw up//ill religions surlc." Great,
huh? And here's the best part:
each side of the record is only
around seven minutes long-
the whole album's less than 15
minutes! The Kennedy's have
really changed my whole life;
like, I met this great girl when I
was buying the record. Her
name's Genocide and you'll
meet her when Ibring her home
for spring break. (But Mom,
don't say anything abour her
hair or her clothes 'cause she's
really sensitive.)

Well, I gotta go now. I just
wanted to drop you a line and
tell you what I've been up to
lately. Tell everyone I said ”hi"
and give old Rover a hug for me.

or something, I mean, you're gonna
get pissed off! I think after a while,
you're gonna go, like, ‘Man, where
are you coming from?”’ He laughs.
”So, we're intelligent enough to
know that. We like our freedom to do
different things, but we aren't dumb
to just do it on a whim. To Change the
world, that's kinda hard to do."

Much later, with more feet passing
the door and Nile looking at his

worse concert experience. With a
quick look at one another, Rogers and
Edwards almost say it at the same
time, laughingly, "Dallas!" The first
time in Dallas, as Nile recalls, they
”slayed 'em." Bernard takes over, dis-

time.

 We went out on the road with
this big production, i_t was a big hall,
and Nile and I got so far away from
everything, working all the time... we
didn't get a chance to rehearse. .We

 
 
 
   
 

just went out on the road, with this
big show thinking it would be okay.
For some reason, after we got out
there, there were like, four acts
before us: Confunkshun, Slave, a
whole bunch... and it sold out. This
was a great show, and the people
were just sitting there. It was kinda
like, ‘What are you doing .7’ It’ was like

we were kinda above the whole thing’, » I 
to them; the suits, the productir’-\ .1.‘

like, ’ That was why
stopped  ~. . We felt musically,
this doesn '

t how we're feel-

i  g. We were
inhibited by oil  production, we ,
kinda put ourselves in a cage....We
weren't performing, weren't project-
ing. We really didn't feel good with
what we were doing; (Nile adds they
were tired.) Yeah, tired. Nile and I were
working on three or four records at a
time.

”Life was pretty weird for a while. __.s.
All of a sudden, that one day seeme_:''’‘ ‘
to bring i-t to a head. Because  .
always love to perform. And if 
audience isn't reacting, I never think ‘
it's them. I never go, ’Aw, they just
don't know where I'm coming from.’
You figure it out, and say, ’I’m doing
something wrong.’ We talked about it
at length. .

”Sure, we finished the show, but it
wasn't a hundred percent, because

I you become intimidated, you start to‘

feel like, ‘Wow. . Are they gonna
attack us?’ And when we were over a
lot of people were saying, ’Y’all wer-
en’t’that bad, I kinda dug you myself.’
Well, I'd say, ‘Why didn't you clap?’ "I
don't know.’ It was as if it just started
happening, something took over tlyﬁg
place. As we got out there, the place
just kinda quieted down....”

There were five groups in Dallas
that night, four had one-hour shows,
so by the time Chic hit the stage, the
listlessness of the crowd was at least
partially understood. ”’Here comes
Chic.:.aw, naw not another one!!”
says Bernard, pre " nghe is one of
the Dallas fan" '
