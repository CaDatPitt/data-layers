Abortion Payments Cut by Senate

The latest addition to the Hyde amendment passed recently by the
US. Senate that eliminates rape and incest as exceptions for federally
funded abortions will likely lead to further court injunctions and
greater access. to the emergency funds of several non-profit pro-
abortion groups, according to a spokeswoman from Allegheny
Women’s Center. At present time, 25 to 30 percent of all women

' having abortions are below the poverty level‘. A A

While only women whose lives are endangered by pregnancy will be
eligible for federally-funded abortions under the new addition, the
spokeswoman noted that this type of funding willcover only 50

percent of the costs. ., .  ..,_ ,

By SCOT STONE

Pull News News Editor

In I980. crime at Pitt rose .6 per-
cent, the crime rate dropped 7.l per-
cent, and no murders, rapes, or
armed!‘ roberies were reported,
according to statistics in a soon to be
published report by the Pitt Police,
Department.‘

William Tucker, Director of Pub— ' . 

lic Safety cited “significant arrests”
and the efficient use of manpower as
factors in the reduction of the crime
rate. 
There were ll3 crimes against

persons reported to Pitt police last ‘

year, according to the report. James
Watters, a police lieutenant said the

absence of serious incidents’ such as
rape or murder, is the quick resolu-
tion of cases through analysis.
“Wecompile monthly computer
reports that describe crime pattern

C by area and specific crimes,“ Wat-

ters said, “and each day‘ we attach
pinsto a map for each crime thatiias
occured so that the officers can see
where things are happening.’_’
Crime analysis enables the depart-

ment to use people more efficiently A
by directing them to problem areas’ .

on the campus’.._According to Wat-»

“This department"7has7. ‘become

The crime stat-istics are based_oni ~

violations of state law and local

campus police. Somecrimes are not '

reported, and some; such as the kill-

involving insurance claims. Others.
such as minor thefts and rape may

"The university community, mir-

standard piece of office equipment,
and people are less concerned about
security}?

For Watters, education is the best
way to solve the problem.

“In some cases there were no
recorded serial numbers on the
stolen equipment, Watters said.
“But we’ve recognized this problem
early, and we believe that education
can be effective.

In the case of office security, in
general, more direct measures are
being taken, according to Watters.

‘ On July I, the Department of Public
Safety-will takeover-t-hejob of issu-

ing and approving requests for‘keys
from the Physical Plant department.

“Half of the thefts in Schenley
Hall show no signs of forced entry, "
Watters said. “This indicates that
someone on the inside is involved."

Easy access to office keys and
night passes make the apprehension
of the criminal difficult’. According
to Watters, it is almost impossibleto
catch someone after the fact because
of the number of people who can
legitimately get into offices.

An educated citizenry, a com-
mited police force, and cost effective
secu_rity measures are the primary
resouces the Pitt police have to fight
crime. _‘

According to Watters, one of the
best strategies for protectingioffices
is the implementation of“cost effec-
tive" security measures. These are
precautions a person can take to
make the workplace more secure, at
a cost that is relative to the value of
“stealable” equipment.

“We do a physical assessment ofa
building or office, and then make
recomendations, both physical and
procedural,” Watters said. “Our rec-
ommendations have held against
criminal attempts."

The active presence-of the police
themselves, has a large effect on
reducing crime statistics. According
to Watters, over half of the 56 man

' force have college degrees,‘ five times ‘

theinational average, a statistic that
reﬂects a high level of professional
commitment.

In general, the tactics of Pitt’si'

police have been preventative, or as‘
Watters describes them. I “proac-
tive." They attempt to make people
aware of the ways that they can
insure their safety, how offices can

_ be made more secure, and. through

analysis, determine where the areas
of danger lie.

“We’re not going to eliminate
crime completely,“ Watters said,
“but it is much more profitable to
prevent crimes than it‘ is to-

iprosccute.“ ‘I    - -- ~‘~ --‘

Debaters Win Championship

The coach has been coaching for
14 years, enjoying the kind ofjob
security usually reserved for some-
one like Bear Bryant. The players
spend their time photocopying arti-
cles and passing excerpts on note-
cards. They prepare for their
ten-month season in the basement of
the Student Union. They carry filing
cabinets to tournaments.

This is not exactly a profile of a
typical Pitt national championship
team.

But the Pitt Debate team estab-
lished itself as No. l inthe country in
April/by defeating 61 other debate
teams in the national finals in Cali-
fornia. Like any other team con-
tending for a national trophy, the
debaters hard to prepare extensively
and survive competitive scheduling
to earn the top spot among debaters.

Dr. Thomas Kane, debate coach
and associate professor of speech
communication, said preparation
for debating on the national circuit
begins in July, when a standard
debate topic is voted on by debate
coaches across the country. The
debate team then begins to research
the topic and determine its positions

‘ and arguements.

Kane explained that national cir-
cuit'debating, in which Pitt com-
petes, is a more signiﬁcant level of
competition than the standard
debate circuit.

“You’re competing against some
of the brightest students from other
campu»ses,”. Kane said. Pitt ‘debaters
have competed and won against
Harvard and Dartmouth, beating

_ Dartmouth ,5-0 in the final round of

thenational finals. ' ,
Kane» said‘ his role as a coach is to

help. the debaters refine their ideas,

and ' anticipate arguments against,
their cases. There are about 22

Some surprising statistics emerged from the Pitt
Police Department recently. Crime on campus rose
only six percent, and_ there were no murders, rapes or
armed robberies last year. These figures could be due
to the new beefed—up manpower and computerization
programs the campus police have adop ed.

But a far more compelling reaso is partially
responsible. People are becoming more aware that
crime could happen to them at any time, and are
taking steps to prevent this. The police department
calls this “public education.”

It could also be called fear.

If-is disturbing that-a decrease in crime should rate
such gratitude, demonstrating that we have become
used to living under threat, to function under duress. It
has become common—place to assume that an unat-
tended purse' ofcalculator has been ripped off, or to be
wary of the streets and dormitories after l0 o’clock.
We can assume there were no reported rapes in Scaife
Hall last year because there was no one there after ‘
dark.

Perhaps it shwws a certain ce"I~:giate pessimism to
find dark clouds hidden within such good news. But i_t
is callow to think crime will continue to slow down, to
think that rapes and murders will end, to think that
one fine-morning Oakland will sound like the Utopia
reserved for John Lennon lyrics. No, tomorrow will ‘

bring padlocks and chained bicycles, security doors '
and apprehension. It has become a code of identifica-
tion, a signature of locale: “I go to school at Pitt. l lock"
my doors.”

There is /another interesting item released by the

_ \ ' 2 campus police. They suspect a portion of the crime at
. Pitt is done by insiders—students and faculty. This
news, unlike the crime decrease, holds no surprises. lt
is doubtful the person who took your calculator was a
shopping-bag lady. It is hard to forget that Sidney
Brinkley, the accused killer of Pitt student Monica
Renee Jones, was a live-in guest of another Pitt stu-
' dent. As Pogo said: “We have met the enemy, and he is
us.” i ‘
‘' While the news from the police is encouraging, it
can be treated as nothing more that a respite. We
applaud the work of the campus secuiity staff, but
‘ somehow words of thanks ring hollow:

There were no murders, rapes, or armed robberies

reported on campus last year.

But that’s the way life is supposed to be-

Trendy Arguments And Changing Laws

By MARK COLLINS

Pitt News Stall Writer

One theory of public opinion-

dating back to John Adams-states
that in any revolution. at least one-
third of the populace must be com-
mitted to a cause in order for it to
succeed. Another one-third, the the-
ory guesses, will be supporting the
opposition, and the final third will
be strongly indifferent. Historians
found Adams’ assumption of the
American population in the l770’s
to be acc'urate, andthe outcome of
that war is, well known.

Also from that period is a docu-
ment found in the Federalist Papers,
a tract written by Madison concern-'
ing minorities and faction. The fact
that the Founding Fathers were so
acutely aware of the “mischief of fac-
tion" is not surprising, considering

the above theory. As a result of this-

political perception, representation
of minorities became one of the dog-
mas of this country’s Constitution.

There is a third historical note
here: somewhere in» the Bill of
Rights—near the top, as I recall my
grade school history—-‘lies the
amendment, “all citizens will have
the right to bear arms." It is unfortu-
nate for liberals and gun control
movements that this statement isn't

buried as a forgotten clause, lost in

the back sections.of the Constitu-
tion, near the sports page. -There is

. 9 doubt, .§o..the prominenge. of
‘is amen  ‘at the Founding -

Fathers really meant it.

200-odd years later, we are
invloved (again) in the great
national debate over gun control.
Its a trendy argument, surfacing
periodically when one of our own
citizens begins pointing aimed muni-
tions at one of our own elected offi-
cials. (If this never happened—i.e.,
that elected officials were never shot,
only other ordinary citizens—4t_he

United Nations Representative
Jeane Kirkpatrick has stated that
foreign policy must be»looked upon
as an “ideological struggle”. What

turns out is the first hearts and

minds to be won are not those ofa
Third World nation, or European

nation, but ours. It is through the,

new “human rights” policy that the
government lS asking us to redefine
our world view. This is being done
on three fronts: by telling us-that
President Carter’s human rights pol-

icy had been aimed at our allies-

exclusively; that all of the unrest in
the world can be laid at Moscow’s
doorstep: and that there is a quan-
titative difference between “authori-
tarian” (captalist) and totalitarian
(Communist) governments. '
The charge that the light of viola-
tion of" human rights" was trained

exclusively‘ upon our right-wing

allies simply is not t‘rue.“~.'l'he» policy

S which began from'Carter’sinaugu-

ral address, ‘had as‘ its first targetithe
U.S.Sj.R. The policy led to. great
furor both ‘within Car'ter’.$iAdrninis-‘
trafion and outside of it,.with debate
of its effectiveness at curbing Soviet

abuses as well as on the policy’s hurt- a
. ing detente,

In a speech on April“22, I977,

‘Leonid Breshnev stated °that the ‘

Soviet. Union would not tolerate
muddling in its internal affairs under
the cover of “the violation of human
righ-ts in Socialist countries.” Arthur
Slesinger warned the President that
the policy must not become “one

more stick with which to.) beat .the .

Russians.” Soviet dissident Andrei
Sakharov wrote that “I welcome the
new, active stand adopted by some
parliaments... in particular the_ posi-
'tion of ‘President Jimmy Carter."

of‘ our forefathers were military
types, or the more obvious truth that
men like Alexander Hamilton died
in violent games like dueling. While
one may argue that establishing a
right to bear arms was primarily a
move to strengthen national
defense, it is naive to believe this to
be the sole purpose.

What is left, then, is to argue not
intention of the framers but present
national attitude. It is impossible to
judge what Adams and Madison
would have thought of our present
society-—and maybe dangerous as
"well. While" we often must interpret
the purpose of the "Constitution's
authors, making our own decisions

independent ofthe past is sometimes '

necessary. John Adams does not
have to worry about armed robbery
on McKee Street, nor does Dolly
Madison fear for her life being raped
at gunpoint in Scaife Hall.

It is up to the present generation,
then, to respectfully ignore the
wishes of the minority—.however
vocal——and‘ begin to act rationally to
irrational weaponry. It wouldn‘t
take a revolution to bring this about,
but a simple amendment: the act of
amending is the greatest. legacy we
have received from our founders. It
allows us to change our laws when
our attitudes change—like the
amendment that freed the slaves, or

‘gave women the right to vote.

* Or the one that gave citizens the
right to bear arms. V

Further we are to accept that there
is relative repression. Ernest Lefever
calls for “silent.diplomacy”.in deal-

General Haig reminds us that we
cannot embarrass nations who
“believe in. God” and are “anti-
communist." Kirkpatrick claims

~that there is a “different. kind of

tyranny” practiced in Communist
and non-communist couptries.
There sure is a different kindof
tyranny. The communist nations
won’t allow the capitalistic firms to
come incand exploit their resources
and workers. This is not to say that
communist workers are not exploit-

t ed; they obviously are and need this

trumpeted to the world. If it were
not the profits involved, then how

, 'could the Administration make a
quantitative distinctionbetween the _c
pain of a Jacob .7l'imerman and "And-‘— '

As for_ the Pirates, Stargell suf-

past injuries, which prompted
the team to look for another first
‘ baseman. '

“The_Pirates would have never
thought of obtaining me for the
season, if Willie-and Robby were
healthy," Thompson says.

The transaction to Pittsburgh
from California after days of not
knowing where he would play
was “mentally tough," according
to Thompson. “After the trade
was made, everyone helped out
in the adjustment in coming to

players fitted me into the whole

‘Otherwise Engaged’ Otherwis Boring

By Marlo Gripp

Otherwise Engaged, playing at the
University of Pittsburgh theatre for
two weeks, shakes a moral finger at
those who lead selfish, insulated
lifestyles. They are the type of peo-
ple who avoid giving attention to
other people's problems because of
the emotional burden.

_Written by English playwright
Simon Gray, the play concerns a Lon-
don publisher, Simon Hench, who

’ resists the demands of those around

him with a cool stoicism. Hench,
played by Mark Stevenson, puts up
withlthe intrusions of the obnoxious
young boarder, Dave, played by
Richard .Waddingham. He also,
endures the childish demands made
by his wimpy brother, Stephen,
played by Gary Glasso. It's easy to
sympathize with Simon's disengage-
ment attempts from Stephen and the
other characters who violate his well-
being.

Simon holds up, even when he
finds that his wife Beth, played by
Tere Eglar-Bilsky, is having an affair.
He unemotionallytells her that he

he'd had ,a few himself and suggested
that the marriage continue as before.
Simon's reserves shake however,

when he finds that Beth loves _a man '

he personally dislikes and doesn't
J know which man fathered the forth-
coming baby.

Mark Stevenson's performance
seemed restrained. Simon was prop-
erly cheerful and cynical but not at all
lifelike. Perhaps he was meant to be
played so woodenly. The set by Tony
Ferrieri appropriately mimicked
Hench's personality. It was as if
Hench had thumbed through a Better
Homes and Gardens and picked the mod-

« ern Scandinavian pine room—of-the-
month. ‘ ~

The play's comic moments are few.
The meant-to-be-funny lines, pro-
voke casual amusement, and not
much else. But Simon Hench's jolt to
nasty reality displays fine emotional
conflicts, which give the play a final
sadness. He is convincingly shaken
when Beth attacks his false serenity
and selfishness. ”Don’t you see? It
makes you a freak!" she screams. ”Do

Can a recently widowed, conserva-
tive writer of spy novels and minor
worksfor posterity findhappiness

ing an actress who decorates her
apartment with plastic mushroom
lamps.7'The Playhouse Theatre C_qm-
pany, under the direction of Don
Wadsworth, is performing Neil Sim-
on’s own Dear Abby letterkof a play,
Chapter Two. The four character
comedy, including George Schneider
(patterned. after the playwright) and
Jennie Malone (fashioned after the
real Mrs. Si_mon,, Marsha Mason),
explores the stages of relati‘onships
as George begins to breathe after the
death of his wife, and Jennie after the
divorce of her husband. They suffer
the awkward pangs of‘mid-life.dat-
ing-, find whirlwind, passionate
refuge in each other-, marry, and pro-

Although he cannot be approp-
riately describes as a master, Neil
Simon, in Chapter Two, does oversee
his realm of glossy chitchat and
rapiered repartee as aptly as ever.
Comedy is not as much an art‘to

Simonas a craft——a craft he manages -

to execute as economically asdppses/i-

often rich with imagery. Faye, a ner-

changed taxis three times and walked
with a limp into the building and you
gave out this number?” The first act
of the play, the courting and romance

, of George and Jennie, sails along with

theslick conversational twists and
trips that testify to Simon's ability to
capture intoxicationg infatuation
with sparkling banter. The second
act,‘; the decline of all things bright,
beautiful and approved by God and
the State of New York, is not-so suc-
cessfully aimed. Unlike his former,
delightfully cosmetic offerings, Bare-
‘ foot‘ in the Park and The" Odd Couple,
Simon uses Chapter Two to expose his

‘ new-found freckles and dimples, and

in the second half, to unbandage and
air out his old wounds,‘ to glut in the
pain of his loss. The shine of his wit,

translates to mindless, spurting

THE FOUR SEASONS ‘
BY IANE HOLAHAN '
Don't be fooled by The Four Seasons ,

p the latest Alan Alda ego production.

You might think it's.one of those nice
little films like Kramer’ vs. Kramer or
Ordinary "People that gives you deep
insight into the meaning of life, or
you might be impressed by the people

_involved—-Alan‘ Alda, Carol Burnett,

Rita Moreno, Jack Weston, Sandy
Dennis, and Len Cariou. It turns out
though, that _ The Four Seasons is
nothing more than 110 minutes (I

' counted them all) of Alan Alda telling
1 us what a great guy he is-. If you are
into other peoples ego trips you'll

love The Four Seasons. ‘
Beginning in the spring Alda and all
his friends visit various vacation
resorts, and lucky us, we are invited
along. Now I wouldn't mind the invi-
tation if I had any idea who these

 people were, but we never get to

know them.

Writer, director, AND star Alan
Alda is so immersed in the film that
he can't see that all the characters are

up to MASH standards, along with

Lou (Burt Lancaster) lives across
the way from Sally. He's an oldgtimer

who's lived in Atlantic City since its ’
early days. He used to be a ’gofer' for ~

gangsters, but now he is reduced to
being a combination maid—object of

and self-respect.

Atlantic City is a film about the old
and the new, and about the threads-
which tie them together. Just as the

The cast is competent,_yet never
gets a chance to show any skill. Len
Cariou plays a manwho divorces his
wife (Sandy; Dennis)._and starts life

‘anew with ayoung, pretty woman

(Bess Armstrong). This causes prob-
lems within the circle of friends, par-
ticuarly with Alda’s ‘character. The
women have nothing to do but react
to their; husbands petty ”arguments—
and laugh, hystericallyiwhen ‘they

’Legend of The

THE LEGEND OF THE LONE
RANGER
Directed by William A. Fraker

By WALTER WATSON
The Legend of the Lone Ranger, in its
latest incarnation, should have been
left just that: a legend. The film fails

'to shed any new light on the dusty

folklore of truth and justice in the
Old West; that is, if there ever was
any light to be shed in the first place.
Some things are better left unsaid,
and, although the dramatic narration
given about every five or six minutes
by countrylsinger Merle Haggard is
plausible, certain connections in The
Legend would have been nice topiece
together without help.

Thelead is played by dashing Klin-
ton Spilsbury, who may have been
considered perfect for the part. Yet,
no one will ever know if Spilsbury has
any acting ability. After all, it would

have been more interesting to see a

variation on the theme, where the
larger—than—life characters take a step
down off their pedestals long enough
to let the audiences know that they
are human. Co-star Michael Horse is
nearly as handsome as ”Kimosabe" in

the role as the faithful Tonto, but ,
once again, as close as this duo is sup-.
posed to be, one is supposed to under-

stand the friendship and mutual
admiration the two have for each
other through their words (and the
narrator's) rather than their actions-.

Running through the story, Ton-

The sMusicBar (cont. from pg. 3)

lt’s.the closest thing toga mar-

quee that Lillian now-has. ‘

And, even though the bar
seems lifeless from the outside,
once inside the buckling white-
washed front door, there's a
whole sideshow underway.

A sparse crowd _lines the
horse—shoe- shaped bar which is
tended «by Diane, a young bar-
maid,we'aring a leopard print
jumpsuit and wide black leather
belt wrapping a figure that
would fill out an hourglass-
and, ooh Baby! you might even
have to grease the sides to fit all
that sand. .

”I know punkgirls that would

- kill for that outfit,” says‘ a
patron at the bar. ’

In the back, past the bar,
there's a single step up to the
elevated section where Lillian
sits playing the piano and is tap-
, ping one of her red, patent:

leather shoes to. the beat of
”Baby Face,” while ‘two custo-
mers croon along in the back-
ground. You can hear the two
v_oices singing‘ the verses from
the out-of-sight booths which
are obscured by the aging red
chenille drapes that‘ flankgbothll
sides of the platform. .' _ .

looks out over the bar below,

THE GREG KIHN BAND
The Startracker
May 9, 1931

BY SAM MATTHEWS

In essence a rock and roll per-
former is supposed to make the
audience forget that there is any

other world out there other than the’

one they're experiencing at that very
minute, live, in concert. Artists like
Springsteen or the Who manage to
attain these heights. The Greg Kihn
Band almost hit the mark.

On the heels of a top 100 album
entitled Rockihnroll, the Greg Kihn
Band arrived for their first area

few songs to kick into gear. ”Shelia”,
(a Tommy Roe cover) began the
’rockihnroll’ onslaught that ulti-
mately went through most of the
material on the current album (con-
spicuous in its absence was "Woman-
kind"). Using ”The Breakup Song” as
a springboard to slide past the Tom
Pettyisms of the album, the Kihn
Band chose a harder sound than

A what's required on the radio. In the

same respect ”Valerie” and the tropi-
cal "Trouble in Paradise" were rather
joyous.

Although as much has been writ-
ten about Greg Kihn on stage as
Springsteen phenomena, Kihn owes

combining heavy metal-blues-

May 6, 1981
By GEORGE’-HOLZER

Pittsburgh has a long standing
relationship \with the power trio,
Rush. The first concert Geddy Lee,
Neil Peart, and Alex Lifeson played
together was in the Civic Arena.
Then they were an obscure opening
act; now they are bigger—than-life

superstars with a big, loud following. ‘

As headliners, ' their concerts here
have been consistently good draws,
usually selling out. ‘ 
The May 6th show was, if not sold
out, very near.-Both new and .long-
time Rush fans were treated to a vis-
ual and audio masterpiece. The lights,

projections, and flashpots gave the

crowd"/‘a Evisual ~ aspect? to ‘hold onto

What Travers presented this night

was ’a crunchingheavy metal trio
with N certain , jazz rock features-_

thrown ‘in—intricate' bass patterns
coupled with solid, steadydrumming

and plenty of power chords, feed-

The band played most  thenew

Radioactive along with several older

1. Don't obscure your band's
best assets with others liabili-

Enforcers only had four really
good songs, and Romania, when
viewed as a whole, an equal

a sonic edge that's lacking on
this outing (ah, production...).
Only the title cut is up to snuff

HARD PROMISES

~ Tom Petty

Backstreet

Tom Petty had some prom-
ises to keep afterlreleasing Damn
the Torpedoes'last year. Petty,
almost single handedly, proved
that commercially viable rock
and_roll still had plenty of punch
to it. Even though he tries hard
to keep those promises he is
punching a little less hard this
time. ' l .

Hard Promises does a good job
of catching the sleezy world of
hangers on and has beens that
most "follow up" albums try to
embody-——no mean feat for a
record that cost $1million. Petty
is still the perennial loser he was
on Damn the Torpedoes but some-
thing doesn’t feel right.

Petty is trying too hard. His
vocals are more bruised this
time (he sounds like he was born
to be stepped on) but there is
nothing that even comes close‘
to "Refugee". The material is
lacking the edge that Petty’s'
unique voice requires, so it
sounds too oftenlike he's whin-
ing. _ T

The first single off the album,

"The Waiting" is one of the best '
