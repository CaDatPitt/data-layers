Nuremberg
Iriuls of '46

By Anthony Breznican
Senior Staff Writer

Jews and non-Jews gathered yesterday in
Soldiers and Sailors Hall on the occasion of
Yom Hashoa, an annual event held in remem-
brance of the Holocaust.

The event was held to honor the memories
of all the people killed by the Nazis, Jewish
and non-Jewish alike.

“This evening we are all mourners,” Rabbi
Richard M.E. Marcovitz said.

This year’s Yom Hashoa has special signifi-
cance due to the 50th anniversary of the
Nuremberg Trials, in which an International
Military Tribunal consisting of judges
appointed by the Allied forces, brought 22
major Nazi war criminals to justice.

Justice was the theme of last night’s event,
as Michael A. Musmanno, a Pittsburgh judge
who presided over the trials at Nuremberg,
was remembered and honored.

“Judge Musmanno was not just an extraor-
dinary man, and was also not only a judge,”
said attorney Edgar Snyder, Yom Hashoa
chairman. “Justice Musmanno was a cherish-
er of human life and dignity.”

Key speaker Eli Rosenbaum, who is the
director of the office of special investigations
at the U.S. Justice Department and has spent
much of his career hunting down and expos-
ing Nazi war criminals, said that the experi-
ences of those who survived the Holocaust

Russell Means business

By Amanda Powers
F or The Pitt News

Activist turned actor, pro-
ducer, singer and screenplay
writer, Russell Means has
added author to his list.of
accomplishments. As co-
author of his autobiography,
Means has told his story for
one simple reason.

“I want you to know that we
the Indian people are alive and
well,” said Means at his lec-
ture Thursday promoting his
new book and new CD, The
Radical.

“I thought it was time to set
the record straight,” continued
Means, “to tell a little of our
view, our life in the 20th cen-
tury.” .

In 1970, Means became the
first national director of the
American Indian Movement,
and he has led his people in
the confrontation at Mt.
Rushmore, Plymouth Rock,
the Bureau of Indian Affairs in
Washington and the legendary
siege at Wounded Knee.

In 1988. as a Libertarian
Party candidate, Means

became the first Indian to run

for the presidency of the
United States.

In order to reach a larger
audience, Means has moved
his energies to acting. He has
appeared in such films as Last
of the Mohicans, Wind Runner;
Natural Born Killers, Wagons
West, Buffalo Girls and
Pocahontas. Means also began
his own production company
and has written screenplays in

‘ order to ensure that Indians are

depicted as they truly are.

His autobiography is a “per—
sonal triumph” for Means.

“I had this rage  I found
out that it was covering up my
own low self-esteem. N_ow I
know I don’t have to change
the world for people because
now I know how to decolonize
the world is by one person at a
time.”

Means attacked the govern-
ment for the problems that the
Indian people face, even in the
20th century, although most
people believe that the perse-
cution has ended. Means said
that the Indian people have

ROTC holds major .

exercises of the year

By Michael Hoffman
For The Pitt News

For 64 Pitt ROTC students playing war this past weekend
was not only for fun. This weekend’s field training in
Burgettstown sought to test leaders and create new ones.

The field trip, which began last Friday afternoon, placed the
students in a mock military situation and evaluated them on
their performance. It consisted of infiltrating enemy territory,
setting up camp for a night and an exciting Chinook helicopter
ride.

According to Major Richard Loughlin, the weekend field
trip is the “major event” of the year for the students. The stu-
dents take two ROTC classes and three sessions of physical
training every week at the university, leading up to the week-
end excursion.

“This is more or less the culmination exercise for the stu-
dents on all they have learned throughout the year,” Major
Loughlin said. “We are teaching them leadership and how to
work as a team.” .

Cadet Katrina Wahus, a junior and a nursing major at Pitt,
was placed as commander of the battalion on Saturday mom-
ing and afternoon. She led the battalion from the helicopter
drop site through the advancement up an enemy hillside. The
cadets, when opposed by enemy gunfire, displayed advance-
ment tactics and, most importantly, communication skills.

“I used to be timid,” said Wahus. “I learned to take the ini-
tiative and how to be a leader. That’s what the ROTC gives

By Solomon Childs
For The Pitt News

The sounds of Latin jazz
and the smell of delicacies
from Peru to J arnaica ﬁlled the
air Sunday in the William Pitt
Union as Pitt’s Center for
Latin American Studies hosted
the 17th annual Latin
American and Caribbean
Festival. The festival featured
crafts, music, dancing and
food from 14 Latin American
and Caribbean countries.

The CLAS, located in
Forbes Quad, holds the festi-
val every year on Pitt’s cam-
pus as a way for the regional
Latin American community to
get together to celebrate and
share its rich heritage and cul-
ture.

“The festival is the only
opportunity for members of
the tri-state area Hispanic
community to get. together,”
said CLAS staffer Connie
Acosta. “We are a diverse
community -—- we’re black,
white and Indian. Exposing
people to our culture, to our
music, food and crafts is what
the festival is about. We love
sharing our culture with non-

CLAS celebrates Latin
American culture

Hispanics.”

Acosta, who has been work-
ing full-time at the center for
eight years while taking class-
es part—time, said that the festi-
val gets between 6,000 and
7,000 visitors each year and
demonstrates what CLAS has
to offer to students.

“Last year, Mayor Murphy
named the week of our festival
Hispanic Week in Pittsburgh.
According to the last census,
there are 7,000 Hispanics reg-
istered in Allegheny County.
We are dispersed over the
whole community, many of us
being professionals and busi-
ness owners, and this gives us
an opportunity to get in touch
with our roots and expose our
culture,” said Acosta.

One participant, Clara
DeCianntis, has been cooking
her Peruvian treats since the
first year of the festival. She
said she thinks that even
though the festival was not in
one large room, as in past
years, it was better organized
this year.

often motivates him and those
with whom he works.

“It is the experience of
meeting the survivors who
inspire us at the Justice
Department to continue on,”
Rosenbaum said. “They are
what make us want to contin-
ue to search out justice.”

Rosenbaum said that the
outcome of the Nuremberg tri-
als shaped international
jurisprudence forever. .

“It was at Nuremberg that
the surviving members of the
Nazi regime were brought to
justice,” Rosenbaum said.
“Since that time, no Nazi war
criminal can hide behind the
defense ‘I was only following
orders.’ The Nuremberg Trials
abolished that excuse forev-
er.” _

Rosenbaum said that he
hoped the lessons learned at
Nuremeberg would also be

remembered from generation

to generation.

“We may be able to hold out»

some modest hope that a new
era will dawn  one in which
the fundamental guarantees of
righteousness and decency
will be passed on through the

ages,” Rosenbaum said. “The

legacy of Nuremberg lives on
both here and abroad.”

“This is an evening for
remembering,” said Holocaust
Commission Chair Daniel
Butler. “Could the men,
women and children of the
Holocaust imagine that Jewish
communities would join
together with their friends all

rate something they thought
would never be remembered?”
Aviva Selekman, the event’s
coordinator of participants
representing various Jewish
organizations, said that gath-
ering together to remember
the lives taken during the
Holocaust will ensure that
generation after generation
will remember what occurred.
“It will not only be the chil-
dren and grandchildren of sur-
vivors that will continue to
teach about the horrors of the
Holocaust, but everyone, Jew

_and non—Jew alike, will keep

the memory a1ive,” Selekman
said. _

Butler agreed, saying that
events like Yom Hashoa
increase awareness of the ter-
rors of the Holocaust as time
wears the years away.

“This evening is an effort to
heighten our sensitivity, to
feel, to understand, to realize
what happened and resolve
ourselves that nothing like the
Holocaust will ever happen
again,” Butler said.

But time will not wear away
the suffering of those who
experienced the tragedy first-
hand, said Sam Gottesman,
co—chair of the event, who
also recounted his own per-
sonal experiences of losing his
family during the Nazi exter-
mination of Jews. .

“It is said that time is a heal-
er. Somehow, our time is yet
to come,” Gottesman said.
“After all these years it still
hurts.”

ﬁrst came to Pittsburgh, people
seemed very closed minded
about other cultures, but I think
many have changed and can
enjoy something like this,” said
DeCiarmtis. '

According to Acosta, the fes-
tival has always been very suc-
cessful for the CLAS, but the
center has also achieved many
other accomplishments.

“Our center is one of the top

10 in the country for the past 10
years,” Acosta said. “We have
people who come from Latin
American nations to study their
own countries and cultures here
at Pitt. Our library has one of
the largest collections of Latin
American works.”

The CLAS has both under-
graduate and graduate certifi-
cate programs, which this year
included a ﬁeld trip/seminar to
Uruguay as part of the program.

Indian reservations. However,

87 percent of this money is.

earmarked for administrative
costs. Only $250 million
reaches the reservations.

The Indian people have sur-
vived for one very important
reason. Means said, “If you
take care of your mother, she
will take care of you.

“We indigenous people are a
matrilineal society governed
by our spirituality,” said
Means. According to him, it is
the women of the Indian peo-
ple who teach them about
freedom and the fact that they
are free to be responsible.

“That is why I am proud to
be a born-again primitive,”
said Means. “Besides being

late for supper, I’ve never
known fear. That is the final.
lesson of freedom. You are
free from fear.”

Means also spoke on his
personal tragedies and tri-
umphs. Being a son of an
alcoholic, he too became an
alcoholic. However, through
therapy he has overcome his
problems and has learned to
be a good father.

With tears in his eyes,
Means said, “Now lam a real
father. For the ﬁrst time in my
life, I can talk to my sons and
relate to them.” ' 3

When speaking of children,
Means said, “I want children
to know that the sacred colors
of the human race are just that,
sacred colors.”

Means followed his lecture
with a brief question-and-
answer period and the signing
of his book.

ROTC

‘From page 1
This summer Wahus will be

receiving additional military .

training at Fort Lewis, Wash.,
and then will travel to Hawaii
for four weeks of specialized
nursing training.

Following each segment of
the training, the junior cadets,
depending on their perfor-
mance, were given green
cards by the evaluators. Green
cards- were given to cadets
‘who either displayed extraor-
dinary actions or who
responded poorly to the situa-
tion.

“They are evaluating cadet
Wahus’ performance,” Major
Loughlin said of the evalua-
tors. “They give her feedback,
as far ashow much control
she had or what kind of lead-
ership potential she had
exhibited.”

The students participating in
ROTC earn one credit per
semester, with many cadets
receiving financial aid as well.
According to Major Loughlin,
the students earn anywhere
from $3,000 to $12,000 a year
toward their tuition.

Andrew Clark, a junior at

':fj;.l. Pitt, explained that he does
 not receive financial aid and
 that he joined ROTC for the
7:. enjoyment. Clark is also presi-

dent of the Scabbard’ and
Blade, the national honor

-~ society of the ROTC, and a
 member of the Ranger Club.

Clark, speaking about the

-_ weekend field trip, said, “It’s
 as close to real war as you can
 get, that is, without getting
_f}{ killed.”

The weekend trip came to a

 close on Sunday afternoon

with the traditional change in
command ceremony. In the

' ceremony, the “colors” are

taken from the senior cadets,
held until the following
semester and then given to the

 juniors who, at that time, will _
i be seniors.

Operations Officer Chris

f Gilligan said, “It’s the seniors
' who set up-this whole week-
"; end. We have to make sure

that every thing goes all
right.”

“It’s really a learning expe-
rience,” said Major Loughlin.
“They find out what it takes to
be in the regular army.”

Opinions  
Republican platform:
Dump anti-abortion

Democrat versus Republican. Republican versus Libertarian.
Communist versus Socialist. Independent versus everyone. But
what about Republican versus Republican? The Republican
party shows a major split in the ranks during every election,
between the hardline party people and the moderate neo-con-
servatives.

One of the major issues which draws the dividing line is
abortion. Unfortunately, since abortion has become such a
political creature, the issue serves as a divisive ‘force even
within one party. George Pataki, governor of New York, has
decided to fight to remove anti-abortion from the official
Republican party platform. And Pataki’s move comes after 12
years of Mario Cuomo rule — during which the right to have
an abortion came as easy as the right to cross the street. So
Pataki’s move is definitely a move in the right direction.

There are two main points here. First, abortion should not be
a political issue. It is an important social issue, and, as such, of
course politicians are going to take stands either for or against
it. But it should not be something which finds its way into a
party’s official platform.

Nor should abortion be the only issue on which a candidate
runs. Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) decided to make a brief
run for president this year solely on a pro-abortion stance to
combat former Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey’s equally
short run as an anti-abortion Democrat. Luckily, neither of
these candidates stood a chance of winning, but they should
never have even run.

One mistake far too many voters make is that they vote sole-
ly on the candidates’ abortion beliefs. As much as abortion
should not be the only platform for a candidate, neither should’
it be for a voter. There are other issues, both socially and other-
wise, which are equally (if not more) important for an
informed voter to be aware of.

The Republican party is not alone in its division over abor-
tion. Conservative Democrats oppose it beside conservative
Republicans, while moderate Republicans are in favor of it
beside more liberal Democrats. Republicans are feeling the
split more closely this year because President Clinton is run-
ning unopposed in his party. Anyone with any sense of politi-
cal knowledge realizes that this kind of division does nothing
but hurt the Republican chances of winning the election. By
the time they are done slinging innuendoes at each other
through the primaries, other candidates will have nothing to do
but sit and wait for the Republicans to slip in their own mud.

Peres takes a step toward peace

splendor of the American
flag settled in its guarding
shade after having read about
yet another setback to Arab-
Israeli accord. Behind the
Stars and Stripes I see the
shades of the Israeli flag
woven into the stitchery of the
democratic ideal.
My heart and soul are sewn in

Igaze up at the glorious

' that wonderful drapery towering

above my regarding eyes. To
me, our ﬂag represents a symbol
of the democratic foundations
on which our country is ground-
ed, those which laid the
groundwork for the establish-
ment of a Jewish state.

As elections approach, Israel
has been hit with a crippling
wave of terrorism unprecedent-
ed in her short history — most
recently, a deluge of rocket
attacks on the citizens of north-
ern Israel. As defenders of glob-
al democracy, Americans should
praise the retaliatory measures
Prime Minister Shimon Peres
has boldly undertaken to elimi-
nate an international terrorist
threat whose aim is to shatter
the fragile Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations. America has
upheld Israel’s advanced infra-
structure with military, financial
and diplomatic aid. If America
rescinds its nurturing defense of
her ideological sister, Israel will
be coercively destroyed by an
aligned force of neighboring
extremist Muslims whose ulti-
mate endeavor is to see the erad-
ication of the Jewish state, the
Jewish people and all Western
inﬂuence in the Middle East.

The Hezbollah is a militant
Shiite Muslimlfundamentalist
group preaching the eradication
of Western political, cultural and
economic influence from
Lebanon and the rest of the
Middle East and the recovery of
Jerusalem through a holy war or
“jihad” against Israel. During
more than a decade of con-
frontation with Israel, the
Iranian-backed “Party of God”
has waged war against both sol-
diers and civilians in its relent-

Daniel
Weiss

less jihad.

The most recent aggression
by these hostile extremist
Muslims has been a series of
rocket barrages by Hezbollah
guerrillas on northern Israel
which began last week. Israelis
celebrating the eight—day
Passover holidays in the north-
ern ‘Galilee region of Israel will
bear in memory how their holi-
day began with a blast of
Katyusha rockets and ended
with another, leaving one Israeli
soldier dead, at least 36 Israeli
civilians wounded and a number
of apartments in rubble.

This round of hostilities was
precursored by mortifying
advice broadcast-last month by
the Hezbollah leader, Said
Hasan Nasrallah. After he had
just launched 28 rockets at the
Galilee, he recommended in a
March 30 television interview
that Israelis remain in their
bunkers three more days while
he launched more Katyushas
against them.

After having endured four of
these rocket attacks in the last
six months, Israelis have ﬁnally
been spurred into taking retalia-
tory measures against Lebanon,
charging that Party of God guer-
rillas have gone too far in their
shelling of northern Israel.

In part because Hezbollah
was bombing Israel, Prime
Minister Peres lost the 1984
election. To win a mandate in
the May elections for continued
peace negotiations, Prime
Minister Peres must convince
vexed Israelis that the country’s
security, not diplomacy, is his
ﬁrst priority. '

A dovish Labor Zionist. Peres
is a staunch supporter of a
Mideast in which commerce
and prosperity replace military
conflict. The Hezbollah’s
attacks on Israel in the last
month — backed by Syria and
Iran — have forced Peres to
send a message to Syria.
Lebanon and Iran that even a

dove made famous as a peace
symbol can have a belligerent
attitude. Peres’ airstrikes in
Lebanon have won broad politi-
cal support in Israel, including
praise by opposition Likud
Party leader Benjamin
Netanyahu, who said that “it is
time for terrorists to get into
shelters.” Israel’s forceful reply
to Hezbollah terror is meant to
discourage future attacks by
extremist Muslims and reassure
insecure Israelis that peace
negotiations do not inhibit the
government from protecting
their security.

Sheik Nasrallah has defined
his group’s aim in restricted
terms, saying that it only wants
to drive Israel out of Lebanon.
Israel has offered in the past to
withdraw from the area if
Lebanon would insure six
months of calm before the pull-
out and guarantee that the
Hezbollah will not be used
against them. ,

For Lebanon and Syria,
neighbors negotiating with
Israel for a return of the Golan
Heights and southern Lebanon.
peace can only come through a
similar willingness to move
against Hezbollah and the seri-
ous peace negotiations’ that their
leaders continue to reject.

Responsibility for this
month’s raids in Lebanon and
the senseless casualties suffered
on both sides of the border lies
fully with Hezbollah’s terrorists
and the governments in Beirut
and Damascus. Even if Mr.
Peres fails to re-establish his
dovelike image before the elec-
tion, all of us who pledge alle-
giance to the ideals of Western
democracy should be grateful
that he has courageously acted
to sedate an organization which
threatens the very groundwork
of both Israel and America.
Daniel Weiss is a die-hard
Labor Zionist who thinks doves

are as beauti/itl as the American ‘

flag. He would like to give
thanks to opinions editor Erika
Kendra, who will be retiring

rth Panther sports in

worse shape than my

sports writing grade for
this semester, it is with great regret _
that I bring you the ﬁnal grades for
several of Pitt’s athletic teams that
actually played during the 1995-
96 seasons.

Grades are based on several fac-
tors. Teams are compared
amongst themselves, records are
factored, injuries weighed and a
decision about whether I like the
sport or not is also important.

Pitt football: D. Injuries to stars
like Billy West and Denorse
Mosley greatly affected this grade.
The team showed some spark
early in the season but failed to»
overcome a large amount of
adversity. A strict grader would
have failed them for a 2-9 season.

Pitt soccer: A. Few students
remember how the NCAA selec-
tion committee (headed by the
Penn State coach) screwed the
best team at school this year out of
a tournament birth. They beat
national powerhouse Rutgers
twice and were ranked in the top
25 right before the tournament
started

Pitt wrestling: B-. On track for
an A midway through the season,
Pitt grapplers faltered slightly
down the stretch, placing fourth in
the conference and failing to fulﬁll
some expectations at the NCAA
tournament. ~

. Men’s basketball: D+.
Promises of a top-25 team quickly
diminished after our hoopsters
traveled to Rutgers. The resulting
loss appeared to drain the conﬁ-
dence out of a young team with
little mature leadership. Next y
should be different. —

Women’s basketball: D-. Few
positives could be drawn from a
team that ﬁnished the regular sea-

son with fewer victories than an
average human has ﬁngers. But,
they did surprise people by reach-
ing the semiﬁnals of the Big East
Tournament, and that’s enough to
pass this course. '

Pitt baseball: C. The confer-

’ ence schedule has plagued the
team that nearly reached last
year’s College World Series. But
there’s time to improve if the hit-
ting comes around.

Pitt tennis: A-. Not being very
krrowlegable in the sport, popular
legend says this team is threaten-
ing to break a school record for
victories in a season. A bright spot

A lopsided 8-1 win against Mercyhurst on
Sunday put the‘Panther tennis team back on
track after losing to Georgetown 0-7 on
Saturday.

The defeat by Georgetown was just prepara-
tion for the Big East conference tournament
next weekend according to Head Coach
George Dieﬁenbach

“If we meet them again in the conference
tournament, we’d have a better shot against
them,” said Dieffenbach. “We’ve seen how
they play. They are not out of our reach.”

  
  

The Panthers played a seven-point format
on Saturday, so freshman Erin Shalbrack and
senior Alison Baker’s 8-5 win over
Georgetown’s Erin Kamemoto and Katja Senn
did not count: in the ﬁnal score.

Under the seven-point format, the team that
wins two out of the three doubles matches also
wins the point. When Pitt's other doubles teams
lost, the Hoyas took the doubles point

The doubles loss appeared to set a precedent
for the singles matches that followed.

“We got oﬁ” to a slow start in singles,” said
Dieffenbach. “I don’t think my team played
their best tennis against Georgetown.”

Davis fought the Hoyas’ nurnber-one play-

er, Laura Shoelkopf, and won the second set by
one point Davis eventually lost, 6-3, 6-7, 64.

“Fran has been searching for that good win
against a number one player,” said Dieffenbach.
“I thought it was one of her better matches of
the year.”

Jen Bible set out with a win in the. ﬁrst set
against Georgetown’s Katja Senn. She was
unable, however, to retain her momentum
throughoutthe match and lost 1-6, 6-2, 6-1.

The other Panthers’ games were shorter.
Shalbrack lost 6-2, 6-3; Baker lost 6-2, 6-0;
Zielinski went 6-4, 6-1; and junior Tamara
Kalesnik was shut out 60, 6-0.

The game against Mereyhurst was a complete
 '5 reversal. This time, playing with a
if nine-point format, all the doubles
‘  matches counted

 doubles points to win.

Mereyhurst did not have enough play-
ers to form a third doubles team, so
Pitt gained another point through
default.

The Panthers’ only loss came from a
Davis match to Diulus, 6-4 6-2.

“She’s been playing top people each
time she walks on the court,” said
Dieffenbach.

The rest of the Panthers had lopsided
victories. Zielinski won 6-1, 6-1;
Kalesnik won 6-1, 6-0. Bible and

The Pitt Panther baseball team started crawling out of ,
its recent slump this weekend as it took two out of three V
games at Connecticut and raised its record to 20-14-2, 6-8
in the Big East.

Pitt had lost nineout of its last 15 games before this 1
weekend.

Pitt opened the series with a 6-3 win over the Huskies in
the first game of a doubleheader. Matt Skokowski (3-2)
got the win for Pitt, giving up only four hits and not
allowing a run or a walk in his three innings of work.
Steve Rakaczewski also recorded his seventh save of the
season for the Panthers. Gregorski was handed the loss for
Connecticut, giving up four earned runs and three walks.

The Huskies got on the scoreboard early when Reuben
Wilson scored on Billy Rich’s grounder to short. Wilson '
reached on a single, stole second and advanced to third on
a balk by Panther starter Jason Hoppa before scoring.

Pitt answered in the top of the second. John Herlihy led
off the inning with a walk and moved to third on a double
by Rob Garvey. After Jason Workman flied out, Joe
Carter doubled to score Herlihy and Garvey and give the
Panthers a 2-1 lead.

The score remained 2-l until the fourth, when Pitt
added two more runs. Herlihy again led off the inning
with a free pass to first and then stole second. Workman’s
ground ball to third allowed Herlihy to advance to third
base.

With two out and a runner on third, Carter got his third
and fourth RBI of the game with a two-run home run. Bill
Derr ended the inning by ﬂying out to right field.

Carter, who leads the team with a .400 Big East batting
average and is tied for the overall team lead with Jeff
Murse at .306, finished the series 5-9 with six RBI and
also scored three times.

Gymnastics. ﬁnishes year
at NCAA Regionals

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. —
The Panther gymnastics team
thanked co—captains and seniors
Mikey Myers and Brenda
Stevens for their leadership by
delivering a strong perfonnance
at the NCAA Regional
Championships last Saturday.
Pitt beat the University of Rhode
Island 188.075 to 187.3, ﬁnish-
ing sixth. Penn State won the
meet with 193.650 to advance to
the NCAA Finals next week in
Alabama.

Pitt had a rocky start with a
45.1 finish on beam, an event
that demands the ability to regu-
late both the athlete’s timing and
nerves.

“You want to start on vault,
where you can be aggressive,
not beam, where you need pre-
cise control.” said Assistant
Coach Steve Craig.

“There’s only one thing worse
than starting on beam, and tl1at’s
ﬁnishing on beam when you are
chasing a lead,” said Head
Coach Debbie Yohman.

That’s what happened to
Rhode Island’s team. Going into
the last rotation, the Rams were
within points of overtaking Pitt.

The Panthers tackled their
problems early in the meet so

that during the second round, .

when the team had a bye, they
had the opportunity to regroup.

Pitt came back on the floor
with a score 47.725 with the
assistance of the three freshmen.

Freshman Sara—Claire
Campesino’s . performance
demonstrated that she was back
from injuries she incurred at the
beginning of the season. She had
a polish and ﬂair that compli-
mented her solid landings on
each tumbling pass.

Junior Robyn Senior did her
part by ﬁnishing eighth out of 49
competitors. Due to ties with
other gymnasts, Senior stood in
ﬁfth place on the winner’s podi-
um.

Most gymnasts position them-
selves almost as a rotating ball
during their tumbling passes,
grabbing their knees into their
chest in a tuck position. Senior’s
elements call for her to be in a
layout position so that instead
her body looked like an unfurled
sail riding the wind as she
moved down the length of the
mat. A

Stevens continued to show
leadership for the rest of the
team despite a new injury. Even
though this was her last meet,
she added a second double back
in her ﬂoor routine. She didn’t
think it was surprising to add a
new element to say goodbye to
gymnastic competition.

“What do you have to lose?”
she said.

Stevens’ ankle had been so
weak that Yohman hadn’t
known if Stevens would be able
to compete in the ﬂoor exercises
and had junior Lori Buck warm
up for the event.

The team’s concentration also
came through on the vault, and
the team scored 48.7425.

Freshman Erika Flamer, the
only Panther competing using a
vault with the highest degree of
difficulty, finished in the top 10
with a score of 9.725. On one of
the vaults, she landed torqued in
the wrong direction. Instead of
having both feet on the ﬂoor, she

was only on the ball of one foot.

Flamer bent her knees even fur-
ther in a effort to push her feet
into the ﬂoor. Finally, gravity
took control, and the gymnast

had to take a small step to regain '

her balance.

Flamer’s consistency earned
her ninth place in the top 10 all-
around. '

The uneven bars was the last
event. Stevens tied for ninth with
a score of 9.775, which put her
at fifth place on the winner’s
podium. A ,

It was an emotional meet for
the team, and several were in
tears as Stevens completed her
dismount.

“Brenda and Mikey did a
good job keeping the team
together after North Carolina,”
said sophomore Tracey Brown,
referring to a tough loss earlier
in the season. “They kept our
spirits up and always cheer us

up.”

“It’s hard to see them leave,”
said freshman Janet Highhill,
who also had a strong bars rou-
tine and ﬁnished 14th.

“That was my biggest person-
al goal,” said Highhill, “to hit on
bars, to do what I’ve done in
practice.”

“Janet went three for three,”
said Yohman. ‘That’s the kind of
competitor we expect her to be.”

Yohman was proud that
Highhill had learned to handle
her nerves in a highly competi-
tive collegiate competition. It’s
something she expects from all
the competitors.

“That’s what we need to do to
play with the big boys,” said
Yohman. “We haven’t been on
this level [against these competi-

tors] in a while. We show [the] .

talent and skill we’re develop-
ing.”
The Panthers themselves want
to take this new—found confi-
dence into next year.

“We want to be a consistent

190 team,” said Highhill.

NOTES:
After his ﬁrst season with Pitt,

Assistant Coach Steve Craig'.:>;vas~

voted by his colleagues to
receive the NCAA-Regional
Assistant Coach of the year
award.

“The award belongs to the
girls I coached, the administra-
tion and Coach Yohman more
than it does to me,” said Craig.
“Because without them I
wouldn’t be around and be able
to do those things.”

“I think he deserved it,” said
Yohman. ‘The jump in our pro-
gram is due to the freshmen we
brought in, the continued dedica-
tion of the upper classmen and
the work Steve did with the
kids.”

He joined the Panthers after
three years as an assistant at Ball
State.

of the fourth to come within
one run. Chris Bisson led off
with a single, and Dennis
Regan followed with a double
to give the Huskies runners on
second and third with no outs.
The Panthers went to their
bullpen and brought in
Skokowski for Jason Hoppa.

Matt Zawalich grounded to
first, scoring Bisson and mov-
ing Regan to third. Regan
scored on a single by Jeff
Scott. Skokowski got out of
the inning by throwing Scott
out at second on a fie1der’s
choice and getting Wilson to
pop up to right field.

The Panthers got insurance
runs in both the sixth and sev-
enth innings to secure the win.

In the second game of the
doubleheader, the Panthers
and Huskies were tied 3-3
going into the ninth inning
before Pitt posted seven runs
en route to a 10-3 win.
Rakaczewski, the fourth
Panther pitcher of the game,
got the win for the Panthers
and raised his record to 3-2 on
the season.

With the score tied in the
ninth, the Panthers sent pinch
hitter John Herlihy to the
plate.

“Her1ihy laid down a drag
bunt and got on base to lead
off the inning,” Joe Carter

said. “He usually doesn’t,

bunt, so we ' caught
Connecticut‘ off-guard.
Everybody got fired up, and
we ended up scoring seven
runs that inning.”

Sunday wasn’t a good day
for the weather and ended up
even worse for the Panthers as
they dropped the final game of
therseries 16-2.

When the Panthers arrived
at the field, the conditions, 35
degrees and rain, were not the
best for a day of baseball, and
the game was postponed for
nearly two hours.

“We’re not trying to make
excuses, but the delay really
hurt us Sunday,” Carter said.
“It was basically a ﬂip—flop of
the day before. This time they
were hitting the ball well, and
we didn’t do much.”

Mike Rohrbach (4-3) gave
up eight earned runs in his
three innings of work and was
dealt the loss. Connecticut’s
Joe Nadeu raised his record to
2-3 on the year after surren-
dering eight hits and only one
earned run in eight innings of
work.

Connecticut’s Regan dealt a
big blow to the Panthers in the
second when, with bases
loaded, he sent a Rohrbach
pitch over the left field wall
for a grand slam. Regan fin-
ished the day 2-5 with 6 RBI
and two runs scored. Right
fielder Rich also went 2-5,
had RBI and Scored twice.
Grabowski went 3-4 with
three RBI and three runs
scored in the UConni hit
parade.
