Panhellenic To
Open Spring
Rush Season

Women’s Fraternities to
Rush 191 During Three-
Day Period

Pledging Is March 6

Out of the total of 315 non-frater-
,nity women whose names were sub-
mitted for eligibility to the Dean of
‘Women’s Office a week ago last Wed-
nesday, only 191 had records which

will permit them to participate in the
women’s fraternity rush season which
begins Thursday. Low scholastic
average, insufficient credits, short
campus residence, conﬂicts with Cus-
toms Committee or Senior Court, are
some of the reasons why 129 women
were marked ineligible for rushing.
The spring season is the main rush
season of the year for women’s frater-
nities. This year it will extend over
.a three-day period, beginning Thurs-
day afternoon at 5 o'clock, and ex-
tending through Saturday. Invitations
for the ﬁrst two days are blanket,
while those for Saturday are to be
extended Friday. Fraternities will
have received answers to their invi-
tations today, and will be able to plan
deﬁnitely for the number of rushees
to expect at each of their parties.
Following the policy sponsored by
Panhellenic Council for the past two
seasons, fraternities will reduce their
budgets. Many formal dinners are
scheduled, however, bridges, teas,
theater parties, and a variety of novel
parties ﬁlling in the week-end.
“Panhellenic’s experiment last year
in eliminating men from their rushing
parties proved so successful,” says
Mary Garber, Col. ’33, president of
Council, “that the association has de-
cided to continue the practice this
year.” The rule was instituted be-
cause of the belief that the rushees
might be inﬂuenced in making their
choice by their male escorts rather.

than the merits of the fratei:mt;L....L

itself. " _
The traditional “Silence Week will

begin at 12:30 o’clock, Sunday morn-

ing, allowi-iig fraternities a half hour
to see their rushees home, and will
extend to noon the following_Satur-
day. During this time fraternity wo-
men and rushees are to hold no con-
verse relative to fraternity matters.

Any group breaking this- ruling will

be held responsible to Panhellenic

Council. _
Rushees must return their ballots

to Heinz House by March 3. As was

explained at the Freshman Education

Assembly, last Friday, rushees must

check on their ballots no fraternity

which they would not consider. join-
ing. A mistake of this kind will be
considered as a broken pledge, and
as such, will be penalized by being
marked ineligible for fraternity for
one calendar year. _

All groups will conduct their pledg-

ing ceremony on Monday, March 6.

Senators, Chain
Gangs Interest
Debaters

   

The nation's capital provided
additional entertainment for the
Pitt debaters when they attended
a session of the Senate on their
way to the South. The debaters
listened to “Kingﬁsh” Long for
ﬁve minutes and then left the gal-
leries in disgust. They also heard
Sen-ator David Reed who impress-
ed them as an excellent speaker
and a ‘worthy representative of
his party.

The University of North Caro-
lina welcomed the tourists not
only as men of forensic ability
but as authorities on political
affairs. Invited by a professor of
municipal government to address
his class, the debaters lectured
on present day government in
Pittsburgh.

Just a few days before Pitt stu-
. dents were going around shiver-
ing in zero weather our Rover
boys, clad only in bathing suits,
were enjoying breakfast on Mi-
ami Beach, Florida.

One of the most interesting and
exciting moments of the trip oc-
curred as the debaters were pass-
ing through Georgia. They mo-
tored along the road beside
which one of the states famous
chain gangs was working. Bore-
man, catching sight of a man in
a striped uniform working with-
out any chain encumbrance,
blurted out, “There goes a fugi-
tive from justice.” Unfortunate-
ly for the melodramatic aspect of
the inci-dent, the fugitive from
justice turned out to be a trusty.

“Shutdowns”. Net’

Justified Claims
Review Editor

Mr. Bervard Nichols, editor of
the Pittsburgh Business Review,
shattered the delusons of a great
many local business men last
Tuesday when he addressed the
Alpha Kappa P-si weekly meeting
at the Fort Pitt Hotel.

In -his talk, “Maladjustments in
the Present Situation,” he pointed
out to his audience speciﬁc ex-
amples of grave inequalities and
weaknesses in our contemporary
economic set-up, and said that
suich weaknesses must be rem-
edied before improved business
can make its debut.

One of our chief troubles he
cited as being the uneven and ser-
ious decline in the prices of raw
commodities and ﬁnished goods.

Other weaknesses in the pres-
ent s-ituation, according to Mr.
Nichols, are unemployment, de-
cline in wages, the greater effi-
ciency of production over distri-
bution, and the change in the
purchasing power of the dollar.

One of the high lights of Mr.
Nichols talk was his assertion
that “there is no such thing as
over-production, although under
our present scheme of distribu-
tion we may seem to be produc-
ing too much.” . “Until every man
in the United" States owns a.
“Rolls-Royce,” says Mr. Nichols,
“there should be no reason for
‘shut downs" in our factories!”

Dean P o tt e r

Purdue Engineering School
Head Here Thursday

 

Seminar I meetings for mechanical

ing will be eliminated this week in
favor of a joint meeting of the ASME

ing School at Purdue University,
Lafayette, Indiana, will speak at a stu-
dent meeting of the society.

Dr. Potter who came here as the
guest of the Mechanical engineering
dlepartment of the University, is- noted
no't only as a prominent engineer,
but as a lecturer and the author of
a number of text books on mechan-
ical engineering.

Born in Vilna, Russia, in 1886, he
came to this country with his parents
at the age of 15 to Boston where he
entered Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and received his bach-
elor of Science in mechanical engi-
neering, in 1906.’ He then went to
Kansas State University where he be-
came suocesssively professor and dean
of the engineering school at Kansas
State, until 1920 when he transferred
to Purdue.

While at Kansas State, Dr. Potter
received both his masters and his
doctor's degree in mechanical engi-
neering.

Interested in education, Dr. Potter
was chairman of the national commit-
tee on education in engineering in 1924,
He was also made vice chaiman on a.
committee on land grant colleges un-
der the late President Calvin C'ool-
idge. Dr. Potter became the national
president of the ASME, at the socie-

ty’s meeting in December, of last
year.

Rush Period

Allows for Dances on
Schedules Tonight

Silence Begins Sunday

-Yesterday morning at 8:30 o'clock,
the curtain shot up on another round
of free lunches, dinners, and cigar-

ettes, and a series of smokers, dances,
theaters, bowling parties, and bridge
sessions for about 70 new freshmen,
and aDDI‘0XiII1ate1y, 550 advanced
freshmen and upperclassmen when
official rushing season for men’s fra-
ternities was opened for the second
semester.

Until 2 o'clock in the morning Sun-
day, fraternities are permitted to run
as many affairs as they wish and as
their exchequers permit, in an eﬁort
to increase their membership, Pre-
viously it ‘had been announced that
dances could be held only on Friday
or Saturday nights, allowing each fra-
ternity two of these affairs, but the
social groups will be aided this semes-
ter by the calendar. Since a school
holiday has been declared for tomor-
row, Washington’s birthday, tonight
has -alsobeen included as a dance
night, and a number of fraternities

— have scheduled them.

Mr. Theodore Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men, felt today that it
was unnecessary to again stress the
importance of adherence by rushees
and fraternities to all rules of rush-
ing, declaring that they already know
and appreciate the value of these
rules. Regulations will remain the
same as those that governed the rush
period last semester,

Silence period, beginning Sunday
morning, will be in effect until 5
o’clock Wednesday afternoon, During
this time, rushees will decide whether
they intend to pledge to fraternities,
and if so, which fraternities they
favor. No fraternity member or
pledge may approach a newly regis-
tered student or men rushed by his
fraternity during silence period.

Meets Today

Marlatt Here, Committee to
Decide on Show

VVith Director William Marla.tt al-
ready on the campus prepared to be-
gin work on the 1933 production of
Cap and Gown, men’s undergraduate

committee, with tryouts to follow
within a week. The show is sched-
uled for presentation the week of
April 24.

No announcement of the nature of
the show has been made since plans
for a revue were made public early
last semester. It is suspected, how-
ever, that the committee has some
surprise announcement in store for
the scores of men who willbe eligible
to try out for parts in the cast and
chorus, or for positions on the produc-
tion, business or publicity staﬁs.

Those members of the production
committee meeting with Walter J.

chairman of the group, are Dr. John
S. Ashbi-ook, Dr. Francis D. Brant-
linger, Louis M. Fuslian, John M. St.
Peter, Dr. Benjamin Levant, Gus A.
Schnabel and G. Norman Reis.

Today’s meeting of this committee
in the oﬂice of the dean of men will
determine the nature of Cap and
Gown activity for the year, it was in-
dicated this week by Mr. Rome. Their
decision on the 1933 production will
be aniiounced in the Friday issue of
the News.

6,674   
Now Enrolled
In Courses

Graduate School sustains
Highest Enrollment;
Bus Ads Come Next

1 00 F res hmen Enter

A loss of seventeen per cent in total
second semester registration for the
entire University was recorded today
by John G. Quick, University regis-
trar.

Complete enrollment statistics re-
leased by the registrar to the News
show a total of 6,674 students enroll-
ed now in all classes of the Univer-

sity, as compared to 8,016 students

for the second semester last year.
This ﬁgure embraces undergraduate
and graduate, campus and off-campus
schools, and the Downtown Division.

In the campus undergraduate and
graduate schools a decrease of only

ten per cent was shown, 4,682 stu-

dents having enrolled this year as
compared to 5,183 for the same time
last year. Perhaps the most inter-
esting ﬁgure of all is to be found in
the registration of new freshmen,
which this year fell twenty-seven per
cent below the number enrolled last

__February. One hundred men and W0-
men entered the ﬁrst year class this

month, thirty-eight less than the num-
ber for last year.

In the Downtown Division and the
off-campus centers the percentage of
loss takes an upward bound. The
number of students who registered
for classes in the Chamber of Com-
merce building fell off twenty-nine
per cent, 1,413 students having signed
this year as compared to 1,990 for
February, 1932.

Still greater losses were sustained
by the three off-campus centers,
Uniontown Center leading with a loss
of thirty-ﬁve per cent, having 107 reg-
istrants now as against 168 for last
year. Erie Center followed closely
with a loss of thirty-three per cent,
having 218 students this year and 326
for the previous February, and Johns-
town brought up the rear in the “loss
column” with a decrease of only
twenty-six per cent from the past
year’s ﬁgures. There were 336 stu-
dents enrolled there last year at this
time, while only 249 completed regis-
tration for the current semester. The
average loss for the three centers
was placed at twenty-nine per cent.

Of the campus undergraduate and
graduate schools, the graduate school
itself came closest to maintaining
last year’s enrollment, sustaining a
loss of only ﬁve per cent, 1,045 stu-
dents having registered this year as
against 1,105 for 1932.

The next best showing among the
campus schools was made by the
School of Business Administration,
which suﬁered a loss of nine per
cent; 546 students enrolled there as
compared to 599 for last year.

The College and the School of Educa-
tion, grouped together because fresh-
men in education are now enrolled
as pre-education students in the Col-
lege, shows a decrease in enrollment
of only ten per cent, In the two
schools 2,506 students enrolled this
year, while 2,813 were recorded for
classes the same time last February.

The Schools of Engineering and
Mines each showed a loss of twelve
per cent from the ﬁgures of last year.
Engineering registered 492 students
this year, and 561 at the sa.me time
last year. Mines had a total of 105
students in February, 1932, while only
ninety-three registered in that school
during the recent period.

WSGA Committees Show
Changes In Procedure

With the opening of the new semes-
ter the Student Loan and Hostess

rated slight changes in their activi-
ies.

Men’s, Women’s Rushing
Prime Interest of Week

 

Conflict of -Last 'gThree Days of Men’s Fraternity Period

With Women’s Causes Elimination of Many
Women From Week-End Affairs

 

All purely social events are being
shelved this week in favor of rushing
events. The interest of coed and col-
legian is centered on campus frater-
nities.

Men’s and women's fraternity
houses will be decked out in their
best to receive the “new crop of the
uninitiated. Brothers, having a full
week rushing period, are enveloping
rushees in a maze of formal dinners.
smokers, theater parties-, and what-

not. _ ,

Women will do their best to make
up for the three days time limit Set
on their rushing i>eriod- A11 30?“ °f
novel parties are "being D13-ﬁned» P9‘

 .. .».

Although men have been banned
from women's rushing events. _t11_e
men have taken no steps along .,S1m_1'
lar lines. The women, themselves. _1t
seems, have taken care of this in
part, as their three day rushing pea
riod conﬂicts with the 1astMW€ek'e1i1u
of men's rushing. The f_rater_s v; r

‘College Dance

 

Open up the old, dusty steamer
trunk, girls,-and dig out the green
if you want to knock them “cold”
at the next College Association
dance.

Originally scheduled for Feb-
ruary 10, this ﬁrst association
dance of the second semester was
moved down the calendar last
week so as not to interfere with
attendance _at_the Juni_o_r Prom.

And so the honor of__St. Patrick,
that grand old Hib"ei'i‘ii'an «patri-
arch, will be duly observed on
March 17, the new date set by
Robert Jarvis, College Associa-
tion president, for his social c1ub’s
ﬁrst offering. _ _ _ _

The high moguls of theass:o-
ciation will meet _next week to
meditate the ‘question _of a suita-
ble music dispenser and to dis-
cuss the advisability of decorat-
ing the Schenley ballroom, scene
of the festivities, in green or or-
aiige.

 

Unioersity Metqllnrgists J
To Coritpite Bibliography

 

The seiiior class in metallurgy has

_:i‘us-t begun the work for the ‘compila-
tion of a bibliography, , for the open-
hea'rth p'ro"cess of steel manufactur-
inig. This work is being carried out
under the supervision of .Dr., G. R.
Fitter, chief metallurgist of the United
States Bureau of Mines and lecturer
in metallurgy.
A At the present time, there is no
complete bibliography available on
However, as soon as
this one is completed, it will be pub-
lished by the open-heartli committee
of the American Society for Steel
Treating.

Mr. Fitter is now in New York,
where he is attending the annual
meeting of the‘ American Institute for
Mining and Metallurgical Engineers.
He will deliver an address about a
new development in the ﬁeld of Py-
rometry, or high temperature meas-
erement.

‘ILLUSIDN:

Discuss Permian Basin Oil

 

Archie Bollens Relates Disco

very and Development of Oil

‘ Deposits ‘in West Texas and New Mexico Fields

 

Archie L.,Bol1ens, assistant to

u_.

professor in oil and gas produc-

tion, addressed the Oil and Gas Seminar _at_it_smeeting that took

place Thursday noon. The subject
History of the Oil Development in

-of Mr. Bollen’s speech was “The
the Permian Basin in West Texas

and New Mexico.” Mr. Bollens included a discussion of the geology

of that region.

‘Having spent more than three years in Texas working in geo-

physical ﬁelds and subsurface geo-v
logy, Mr. Bollens drew his informa-
tion from first hand sources. He
says: “I knew every stick, cow path,
and ranch in my district which in-
cluded more than ﬁfteen counties, and
which was about one-half of the size
ofthe state of Pennsylvania.”

Mr. Bollens began his talk by giv-
ing a brief introduction to the signi-
ﬁcance of Permian rocks. He ex-
plained that this large sea of rocks
was deposited in west Texas, south-
east New Mexico, and Kansas. These
rocks are.compdsed of limestone of
great thickness, in some cases reach-
ing 3,000 feet. Above this, there are
thin beds of ‘salt. -including highly
coiiceiitraited "potash. Here, a major
reserve of potash minerals is main-
tained.» These rocks are of compara-
tively new formation -for the geolo-
gist, being only about 1,000,000 years
01 .

A brief outline of the history of the
dev_elo‘pni'ent in the oil ﬁeld then fol-
lowed. It b’e'gan with the discovery
in 1915 of the ‘first producing well in
Reagan county, Big-. Pool Lake, Texas.
This was the ﬁrst oil to be produced
in the Permian Basin and brought the
attention of the geologists and oil pro-
ducers to permian sediments, which
previously had never been considered
as favorable ﬁelds.

Then-Mr. Bollens discussed devel-
opments from 1926 to 1930, during
which time many big pools developed,
such as the Yates, Churchﬁelds, or
Hobbs pools. In addition, there were
about ﬁfteen smaller pools organized

in 1932. . . _

The concluding topic of the talk
dealt with the association of oil with
limestone ‘structure, with particular
attention being given to the fossil
reef system of the Permian Basin.
Mr. Bollens discussed the possibili-
ties of production at depths between
7,000 and .9,000 feet. He explained
that very good reserves can be found
here, an example -being a remarkable
discovery of _a pool in 1929 in which
the shaft had to be sunk about 8,500
feet.
_ After htheusemiiiar speech, the stu-
dents agreed to keep the same oili-
oers who presided -last semester,
namely: James Roche, Oil and Gas
’33, president; Edward, Breene, Oil
and Gas, "33, vice president, and B91‘-
l1_a.I‘d,’C1‘1I_‘I'3.l‘1,> Oil and ‘Gas ’34, secre-
tary-treasurer.

Mortar And Pestle Club
A-nnounces Date Of Dance

 

 

The Mortar and Pestle Club of the

School of Pharmacy, has announced
the deﬁnite date, for its ﬁrst mid-'
year dance. The dance will be
9staged at the Roosevelt Hotel Grille
on Friday, March 3, featuring the
Roosevelt Grille Orchestra. The as-
sessment is $2.00 p-er couple, includ-
ing dinner and dancing from 9:30 to
1:30 o’clock.

Mr. Stephen Wilson, instructor in
pharmaceutical economy, and Mr.
Robert Taylor, instructor in pharma-
cy, were elected advisers at the last
meeting of the group.

Josie, the lovely tra'p'ez'e artist, stands upon a small platform.
At the will of the magic‘ia'ri she leaps twenty feet into the air
to reach her tr‘ap'eze. She uses no jropcs, no ladder! A phe-

nomenal leap for a woman .’. . ‘or a man!

ExiiLANA'rio'N.
Josie d'iidr"i”t jump *. . -. she was sprung! The twenty-foot leap
is not dependent on J'osie’s ability, but on a powerful spring

mechanism hidden beneath the stage which propels the artist

upward through the air. The force is so violentthat the lady
wears alight steel jacket which protects her from injury as

she starts her astonishing leap.

Dukes Upset
Pan_t_I_1_e_r Five

25-__2lI- Deteatﬁpaves Way For
Duquesne Championship

The Panther cagers saw, their
hopes for a city of Pittsburgh basket-
ball championship glow brightly for
awhile, ﬂicker and grow dim, waver,
and then put out entirely for another
year Friday evening,

All this ‘came about during the
course of the'Duquesne game-at the
Stadium, with Chick Davies and Us
blue and red receiving the plaudits of
the 4,500 rabid fans who jammed the
Stadium pavilion to witness the sec-
ond ‘game of the two teams in the
City’s intercollegiate cage race. By a
single point lead, captured within
seconds of the ﬁnal gun, the Dukes
emerged at the game’s end with a
25-24 victory and the city champion-
ship for 1933.

The game itseif, one of the most
thrilling played on the Stadium ﬂoor
in years, saw the Panthers step out
in front at the beginning of the initial
tjuartér; as the Dukesdid in the ﬁrst
meeting of the two teams. Leading
at the beginning by a margin of a foul
shot by Birch, the Carlson ﬁve jumped
into the lead on Cribbs ﬁeld shot, to
maintain. a six point lead at the half
period when the score was 18-12.

But something snapped within the
Panthers when they came out on the
floor for the second half. For nine
minutes the Panthers resisted the
Duke ﬁve, but during that slowing re-
linquishing the lead they had made
during the ﬁrst period. With the in-
jection of Art Feldman into the lineup
the Dukes took the lead at 21-20, the
first time they had been ahead for
more than three-quarters of the game.

From that time until the closing of
the game, the lead see-sawed, back

and forth, with the Panthers losing op-

portunities to stay in the lead when
Smith and McCamant failed to
convert their foul shot opportunities.

As the watch approached the two-
minutes-to-go spot Wainio put the
Panthers in the lead at 23-24. Reiter’s
failure to make a foul shot kept the
lead in the hands of the Gold and Blue
ﬁve. Birch threw the deciding ﬁeld
goal of the game, with less than a
minute to go, when his shot from the
center of the court was good. Al-
though Wainio tried one of his under
the basket shots, it failed, and the gun
went off to signal the end of another
hectic game.

Each team scored eight times from
the ﬁeld, Duquesne netting nine out of
18 fouls, the Panthers scoring eight
out of 12. The Panthers made good
on_ their eight foul shots during the
first half, but failed to score any dur-
ing the second half.

The game was the second one in
which the Duquesne ﬁve had beaten
the Panthers by a single point. In the
ﬁrst game in the city league, played
several week_s_.ago,. Duquesne topped
Pitt 26-25, It also marks the third
time that a Duquesne has beaten a
Pitt team, the Panthers having lost
to the Dukes last year on the Pavilion

ﬂoor.

Seventy-ﬁve boys, representing the University’s track squad,
are now in preparation for the forthcoming indoor championship
track meet scheduled for Saturdayvafternoon beginning a.t,1:3O
o’c1ock at the track house. At that time the varsity and freshman
trackmen will make a concerted attack on théditisting indoor track
records, made by Pickard, Pete Bowen, and others of track fame of
yesterday in an attempt to make up an entirely new sheet of Univer-

sity records for coming track teamsé

to hit at. n _ -

No indoor track meet has been run
off for three years, the last records
painted on the. blackened walls of the
training quarters were those estab-
lished in 1928 and not considered offi-
cial at that.

Coach Olson, since a week before I

the Christmas vacation has been
sending his tracksters through their
paces daily to prepare‘ them for the
coming indoor meets, as well as the
outdoor season which will begin with-
in less than two months.
II/lake Records at Morgantown

The ﬁrst meet in which the team
participated this Year was the ﬁfth
annual indoors at Morgantown, where
West Virginia was_ host to more than
30 college varsity and freshmen teams,
and high school squads. A

It was then that coach O_lsen de-
cided that something must be done
about those long standing records al-
most defaced by years of facing the
weather and dust accumulation. At
the West Virginia meet, many of the
University records were surpassed,
but the marks are the recognized
University records until they are of-
ﬁcially contested. They will be that
when the trackers circle the cinder
track, whizz down the straightaway,
leap over the low and high hurdles,
reach for the roof in the vault event,
and ﬁnd the house ends with the shot
put.

Beginning with the 40-yard dash,
the varsity and freshmen will com-
pete in their own track meets, the var-
sity squad participating in 12 events.
and the frosh one less, as there will
be no two mile event in the freshman
events.

All records made in the coming_
track meet will be considered the of-'
cial University indoor marks for 1933.

Not only will the meet be open to
the varsity and freshmen on the
squads, but any student wishing to
participate may enter upon the com-
pletion of the physical examination
from the Health Service.

_ Special Events Carded

Besides the regularly announced
events,‘ a running hop, skip, and jump
event will be open to any one wishing
to participate. At the close of the meet
a special medley relay will be run-
off with two teams to be ma‘de_up as
the frosh-ju_ni’ors and soph-seniors,
Bill _Keller, the Panther 440-yard star
and varsity relay man will captain the
junior-freshman squad. Chas. Wat-
kins, leadingicontender for the mile
and two-mile honors will be in charge
of the sophomore-senior team.

The meet will not only serve to es-
tablish new indoor University records,
but will give coach Olson the oppor-
tunity of choosing his relay team for

uled March 3 at New York City.
Olson will select his, team on the
basis of the fastest times ‘made in the
quarter mile runs during the after-
noon. Although he is expecting to en-
ter only the relay team in the na-
tional indoor event, he is not limiting
his entries to that one race. Anyone
making an exceptional record in any
of the twelve events during the in-
doors, will be taken along to partici-
pate in the collegiate indoor event of
the year. _

Entries for the Saturday afternoon
meet at the track house may be made
to coach Olson at the Stadium oﬂice
before Friday evening at 5 o’clock.

You can now rent a car as low as 8c per
mile. For courteous service, call

SK! TSK! Isn’t it too bad! Bill
Boner thinks a blizzard is some-

Why doesn’t somebody give him a
good pipe and some tobacco? For a
pipe helps a man to think straight. Of
course, it’s got to be the right tobacco.
But any college man can guide him

Cagers So
East Again

Meetqéebrgetown, Navy on
2‘-Day Jaunt This Week

This week among the athletes at the
University ﬁnds Dr. Carlson and his
Golden Panther ﬁve taking the road
for the fourth time this year to visit
the nation’s capital and barracks of
the midshipmen in the second inva-
sion of the east,

Thursday evening the team leaves
for Washington, where Friday night
ﬁnds the boys opposing Georgetown
in their ﬁfth Eastern Intercollegiate
league game.

Pathers Ahead in League

The result of this game will not
materially effect the standings of the
four teams in the league, but should
the Panthers lose it will be the ﬁrst
they will have suffered in competition
in -this circuit. Having lost four
games and won but one, the Hoyas
will be gunning for their second vic-
tory in the league.

Saturday afternoon will ﬁnd the
Panthers pitted against the midship-
men at Annapolis, The future naval
ofﬁcers boast of a well knit court or-'
ganization, having lost but three
games and won eight during the
present season,

Having lost their fourth game Fri-
day evening the Panthers last evening
set about preparing their offensive
and defensive for their coming east-
ern drive. Their last invasion of the
east two weeks ago elicited a great
deal of praise from the press of New
York City. The team, meeting Ford-
ham and West Point proved a. point-
a-minute scoring combination against
the Rams and cadets.

There should be little doubt as to
the result of the Pitt-I-Ioya game Fri-
day’ evening. In the ﬁrst meeting of
the two teams, which was the opening
one in the eastern league, the game’s
end found the Panthers boasting a 32-
18 victory over their eastern com-
petitors. Since that time the George-
town quint has improved little, its
lone victory coming against West Vir-
ginia week before last, while the
Panthers have ‘defeated Temple, Tech,
and West Virginia respectively to
boast an unmarred record in league
competition.

The team will be without the serv-
ice of Whitey Wilson in the forthcom-
ing games. After a misplaced blow
Friday evening, which landed on the
nose of Dan Daugherty, referee of the
Pitt-Duquesne game, Whitey drew a
suspension from the Athletic Depart-
ment for an undetermined amount of
time, The ﬁrst team will be intact
with Smith, Hughes, Cribbs, Ochsen-
hirt, and McCamant representing that
ﬁve. Dr. Carlson will choose his sub-
stitutes today or tomorrow. Ten play-

' 35.5 seconds.

‘ Success . . . And How

WHILE a ﬁnal statement is not yet available from the office of the
dean of men, unofficial reports on the ﬁnancial outcome of the

Junior Prom indicate a degree of success surpassing that of any
class dance in recent years. As nearly as it could be determined
yesterday, the dance had earned one hundred dollars, above expen-
ses, for the junior class treasury.

Congratulations most certainly are in order for the committee,
"and the News, although regretting the reception that will be given
its own good wishes, is more than glad to extend public commenda-
tion for a job well done. The outcome of the dance leads one to be-
lieve that, as promoters and salesmen, the members of the Prom
committee are in a class by themselves.

Several circumstances, it might be revealed by subsequent inves-
tigation, were largely responsible for this almost phenomenal per-
formance. One of them was the last-minute juggling of the social
calendar which transposed the ﬁrst College Association dance from
February 10 to St. Patrick ’s Day, March 17. The change was delib-
erately and wisely intended to remove as much competition as pos-
sible from the Prom, making it the ﬁrst dance on campus since the
Interfraternity Ball. After that would come the series of social
hurdles we have yet to face. This partial recognition of the need for
immediate action helped immeasurably in relieving the situation.

The other and probably more important factor which inﬂuenced
the outcome of the Prom was the growth and manifestation of a
spirit of “do-or-die” within the committee, a spirit which, admitted-
ly, had its origin in the members’ healthy resentment of exceptions
which were taken to their actions in these columns. The editorial
opinions expressed herein drew the stinging appellations of “rotten”
and “unfair” from highly incensed individuals; such was their
fervency.

This idea that the News was “out to knife the Junior Prom,”
we are afraid, remains a conviction even now. Since it is the normal
reaction, one that was as inevitable as the written expression which
brought it about, we have little hope of seeing its removal. However
our remarks were received, they had the eﬁect of stirring a resent-
ment that can be measured now quantitatively in either silver stubs
or dollars and cents.

This, we hope, will not be taken as an attempt to rob the Prom
committee of the rightful credit for making its dreams come true;
our only possible boast could be that, for once, we were as important
a major obstacle as Hell, high water or the depression.

But looking into the future, we would repeat this editorial state-
ment from the February 10 issue of the News:

“Regardless of what measure of ﬁnancial success is achieved by
the Junior Prom, some level-headed, unbiased thought and study
should be given the structure of the University social program.”

The problems that await solution here outweigh in importance
any that may have attended the Junior Prom; they concern every

student and every social event. Members of the Prom committee,
particularly its chairman and his three associates who are members
of Student Relations committee, should be able to provide some valu-
able information and personal opinion gleaned from their experi-
ence of the past few weeks. Student Council should call upon them
at its earliest opportunity.

l Council Seeks Relief

TUDENT COUNCIL, operating on a budget that has been reduced‘
to an absolute minimum, is about to request the honorary organ-
izations participating in spring tapping exercises to share the ex-
‘penses of the scholastic and activities assemblies.

With a bank balance of only $147.59 on which to rely for meet-
ing expenses of the semester’s program, the undergraduate gover-l
nors have a rightful claim to at least partial relief on this project.

Council ’s record on expenditures during the current school year
has been marked by extreme conservatism. The energy and dollars
which its predecessors expended in petty political debate, investiga-
tions of their own ballot box stuiﬁng and the promotion of steak and
spaghetti dinners, this year have been utilized to a more beneﬁcial
end. President Rose and his charges have, at least, been meeting
without eating.

Both the honorary and professional fraternities tapping at the
separate assemblies instituted last spring are in a better position to
pay than is Student Council. It is, after all, their party. Why the
expense ever should have been borne by Council, except as an act
of timely philanthropy, is the question the legislators are asking
themselves now.

Regardless of how the various organizations react to this re-
quest, apparently there is nothing further that Student Council can
,do about it. If the assemblies are to continue, the money must be
provided by somebody or some organization. If Council cannot go
it alone, what is more logical than to turn to those groups for whom

VEN if the Blaine-Garner resolution for the repeal of the 18th
Amendment fails passage, it has proved that the machinery for
drastic governmental action exists, even in our much damned de-
mocracy. The immediate fate of the 18th Amendment itself matters
little, for its death is as sure as yours and mine, and may be expected

much sooner. But the signiﬁcant factor in the activity of the Senate

and the House last week was the use of the party caucus.

political dodge, and a very good one.
It provides a means by which a leg-
islative representative can vote for
some measure unpopular with his
electorate, yet escape the full wrath
of the people who put him into oﬂice.
He can always plead party solidarity.
He can say that he agreed to vote
“yes” or “no” along with the others

in his party, and that, much to his

chagrin, he was forced to vote
against his convictions. It is a pretty
cheap trick. But it gets results. And
if Congress is to pass the unpopular
but necessary legislation which will
be introduced again and again within
the next year, the party caucus will
have its hey-day.

I think there is nothing disgrace-
ful about such a negation of demo-
cratic principles. In times like the
present, we want to get things‘ done;
and the ideals we may violate matter
little. As for ideals, the only people
who still hold to them are the non-
Russian Communists.

Radio Lowdown

Whatever we may say about the ex-
isting state of American politics, at

condition of American radio broad-
casting. Politics could not get that
bad without precipitating a Red
Terror.

As against the entertainment that
Hollywood offers. radio programs are
not so awful. The rival that Kate
Smith sings is no worse than the
silly passions of Joan Bennett. In
comedy and melodrama, the cinema
and the radio hold equal honors as
wash-outs. But such a comparison is
hardly a legitimate excuse for the
stuff that the national networks of-
fer daily on the air. From their be-
ginnings movies were regarded as
cheap mass entertainment.

They drew from the spoken stage
clientele the gallery and hiss-boo ele-
ment, and in recent years put the
skids under the burlesque business by
the clever use of female legs. Today,
as in the past, good box oﬁice in a.
movie means that there are no ideas
or emotions above the level of a
twelve year old.

A Better Beginning

Radio, however, had more a. re-
spectaible genesis. Its early develop-
ment was rapid. And from the in-
ﬁnite possibilities that were apparent
in it, and still are, great things were
expected. But‘ they are yet to appear
on any but the smalest scale.

Occasiogially some advertiser ﬁnds
it to his advantage to sponsor a sym-
phony orchestra. Radio moguls have
enough -self-respect to allow broad-
casts of the Metropolitan Opera Com-
pany, although this, I suspect, is the
result if pressure brought by power-
ful stockholders who have some inter-
est in the very nearly bankrupt Met-
ropolitan. The average radio broad-
cast remains on the scale of the
cheap playlet, the suggestive song.
and the stale comic.

Taking one Wednesday evening
(which was in our pre-war civiliza-
tion, as I remember, “date night”), I
ﬁnd the following choice programs on
one Pittsburgh station between the
hours of 6 and 12:30—Vaughan de
Leath, Dick Mansﬁeld’s. Orchestra,
Louis L. Kaufinann, Modern Melody,
Ray Perkins, baritone; Myrt and
Marge, Joey Schafﬂer’s Orchestra,
Musical Jubilee, Doake Carter News,
Whispering Jack Smith, Singing Sam,
Kate Smith, Abe Lyman’s Band, Bing
Crosby, The Romantic Bachelor, Guy
Lombardo, George Dewey Washing-
ton, Easy Aces, Dorothy Masters
(songs), Columbia Revue, Columbia
Symphony Orchestra, Eddie Peyton's
Orchestra and Fletcher Henderson’s
Orchestra.

Worth Hearing

In the above list which I have la-
boriously compiled from a. daily news-
paper, there are two news broadcasts.
One of them is laughable for its lack
of news; the other is 90 per cent
power trust propoganda. There is one
symphony orchestra; the odds are
three to two that its program consist-
ed largely of G.rieg and Tosti. The
remaining programs are plain dish-
wate1'.

But to be fair, let us take another
evening, a Friday. If between the
hours of 10:30 and 11:00 the adults in
a given family do not care to hear a
Bridge School or the Street Singers,
the children may regale themselves
with a bit of Beethoven. But only a
bit. For this same program is occu-
pied largely with the following
classics: “The Girl in the Little
Green I-lat,” “Seven Little Steps to
Heaven," and “Throw a Little Salt on
the B1uebird’s Tail.”

By these remarks on the low nature
of radio entertainment, I am not sug-

The party caucus is, of course, a9

least it has not reached the miserable ,

gesting that the executive direction
of the National and Columbia net-
works be turned over to Deems Tay-
lor to do with as he wishes. Radio
is a business proposition. But there
is little reason to believe that it
would not be just as good business to
make the programs offered better.
The networks at present have a mo-
nopoly of the best air channels only
by the kind permission of the Federal
Radio Commission. And unless some-
one is a liar, they -are making 3. hand-
some proﬁt from it.

Old Campus Home

Last To Go,
Leveled

“T-he Eyesore of Frick Acres,”
House No. 4, was dismantled this
week, and it won’t be long before
grass will grow where the former
dipsomaniac sanatarium stood.

In 1880, the house was just an-
other mansion of the nineteenth
century, with all sorts of doodiads
and thingamabobs. Gold ﬂowered
typically hideous furnishings ﬁll-
ed the study rooms.

But along came progress. The
Keeley Cure for Inebriates was
ﬂourishing, and House 4 joined
in the boom. From a. palatial resi-
dence, it was converted into a.
:‘rest home” for men with noth-
ing more nor less than the d. t.’s.
And verily the inmates were re-
stored “to the prime of manhood.”

Just before prohibition, drunk-
enn?es.s—--a, horrid word — disap-
peared -from our fair city, and
Keeley made way for another
vchvaracter builder. the YWCA.
During the war and for a few
years- after, the YW chased pink
elephants, served coffee, and made
House No. 4 generally livable.

In 1923, the Bureau of Retail
Training .moved in. For eight
Years its office force resurrected
old Daintillgs and -poisoned rats,
but found no bottles. In 1931,
the Bureau moved to the Cathe-
dral, and the old mansion be-
came antiquated overnight. To-
day it doesn’t exist.

 

Chess Team Plays
Leading Local
Club Tonight

The chess team will meet one
of the outstanding organizations
of the Pittsburgh district tonight
when it plays the Pittsburgh
Chess Club, a. seven board match
at the Investment Building, The
match is scheduled to begin at 8
o'clock.

includes Bradford Illsley, Roger
Illsley, Waldo Steiner, Albert
Brandon, 0. William Phillips, D.
Goretz, and Norman Horowitz,
playing in the order named.

The Pittsburgh unit, composed
of local business men who have
made chess their avocation and
have reputedly mastered the sci-
ence of the sport to a higher de-
gree than has any other district
team, nevertheless they split two
matches recently with the YMHA
squad which also conquered the
Pitt intellectuals.

The next match after tonight’s
for the Panther seven is a. return
engagement Saturday night,
March 4, with the YMHA King
and Pawn men at 8 o'clock at the
YM and WHA on Belleﬁeld ave-

Chemical Engineers Elect
New Semester Officers

...—._-

 

Last Thursday during‘ the fourth
hour, the administration of the Amer-
ican Institute of Chemical Engineers
changed hands when John Kamenar
’33, president, declared himself not
up for re-election, and ordered: com-
plete revision of the entire executive
personnel.

The ﬁve other seminar groups of
the Engineering School carried on
elections during the previous week,
but their custom is to continue the
president of their units in office for
the second semester also. The Chem-
icals, however, not only selected new
minor officers but a new president
also.

Harold E. Kennedy '33 was chosen
as president for the next semester,
and the other offices were awarded
to the following: Everett C. Girty
’33, vice president; G. Arthur Webb
’34, secretary, and Harold E. Mahoney
'34, junior representative to the Engi-
neering Association Cabinet.

Kamenar, the outgoing president.
gave a short talk before the election
asking the members of the seminar to
give the same cooperation to the new
president as they did to him: He
stressed the need for a continuing of
the spirit of fellowship that has

marked the group so far this year.

Got An Extra Scholarship?

Students in School of Business Administration Have
Many Chances to Get,Scholarship Prizes

 

 

By Harry Sandson
If the School of Business Administration had one of Barnum ’s
barkers outside its doors extolling the wonders to be seen inside, he
might be yelling something like this: “One thousand bucks to be
given away to’Pitt students, get yourself a gold trimmed certiﬁcate,

a bronze medallion, or have your

let!” “All this to be given to Pitt students within these mighty
stone Walls!” Crowds would gather, Dean Armbruster’s oﬁice would

mobbed, and his secretary, Miss
Woods, would wonder in amazement
at the sudden popularity of the school.

But soon the crow_d thins, one by
one they turn away, then in small
groups they go, until only a few stand
hopefully in the office, Why? Be-

cause scholarships are awarded to"

those students in the Business School
who “show greatet efficiency," “or
rank highest in scholarship,” or to
“students who have shown them-
selves to be deserving.” Small won-
der that the mob had thinned!

In all, thirteen awards are made
yearly in the School of Business Ad-
ministration, Eight awards have al-
ready been made, ﬁve are yet to be
awarded.

The largest award is made by the
American Bankers Association. This
association allocates two awards year-
ly of $250 each to deserving students
of junior standing. This year, these
scholarships have been awarded to
Dwayne Mueller and Robert Bain,
both Bus. Ad., ’33.- This is to enable
the recipients to continue their study
in banking and economic courses.

To deserving and meritorious stu-
dents, the faculty members of the
business school oﬁer four Faculty
Scholarships of $50 each. This sum is
contributed yearly by members of a.
comparatively small faculty. Two
winners of the four awards offered
have already been named, one will be
announced soon, and the fourth win-
ner to be announced later in the

THE FEBRUARY meeting of the
faculty of the College will be held in
Room 20-2, State Hall, on Thursday,
February 23, at 3:40 o'clock. In ad-

dition to routine busint-ss there will
be a preliminary report of the Com-
mittee on the Philosophy and Aims

Inside the door to room 801 Cathe-
dra1 stands a record of how Mr. Carl
B, Cass, director of Pitt Players, and
Robert K. McConnell, Eng. ’34, spent
500 hours of their spare time. It is
a complete model stage which stands
on its platform over seven feet high
and has screen sides, and just as a
hint, a glass front,

At the present time the stage is set
for the Players show, “Enter
Madame,” with a miniature living
room designed and constructed by R.
Kenneth Turney, Bus, Ad. ’35. How-
ever Mr. Cass is at work on a model
set for the production “Craig’s Wife.”

Cass and McConnell built the stage
for experimentation and classroom in-
struction. Every one of its many
small and intricate mechanisms is
modeled after standard stage equip-
ment to the scale of one inch to one
foot.

The stage proscenium arch is 31
inches high by 24 inches wide and is
made of ply-wood and plastic paint.
The left is 36 inches high from stage
level upto the gridiron from which
are hung numerous battens, a traveler
for an oleo curtain, border lights, and
a plush front curtain which is counter-
balanced and easily manipulated with

with an adequate pinrail for tying
them off. There is a white back wall
for a motion picture set-up and in ad-
dition to all this two trap doors in
the stage ﬂoor for trick arrangements.
There is a complete series of foot
lights, concert border and rear border
lights wired in three circuits so that
any three colors may be used in com-
bination. The builders have made a.
large assortment of miniature gelatine
screens of a variety of colors to ﬁt
any light on the stage. They have
also made three tiny ﬂood lights and
four spot lights which follow accur-
ately the design of the regular Pitt
Players electrical equipment.
Backstage is a complete switch-
board capable of individual or grouped
control of the various lights and, in
scale to full size switchboards, has a
capacity of 70,000 watts. When the
builders have perfected the switch-
board it will have separate control
rheostats for every light. Already the
equipment is complete enough that
one may work out on the small stage

ors so that they will be accurately

Reveal Lunacy

We are all crazy! Yes, dear pub-
lic, from senator to stable boy we
are all crazy. And this assumption is

understand those queer happenings
which the professors tell us are eco-
nomic events.

ago before the Pennsylvania Water
Works Association convention at At-
lantic City, Dr. Ralph J. Watkins, di-
rector of the Bureau of Business Re-
search, told those at the convention
why he never could understand the
problems of world economy and how
he emerged from the maze of econo-
mic contradictions with a simple ex-
planation of the whole problem. The
expanation is that already set forth in
our preamble.

Sadly enough we are not as sane as
our mothers think we are. Just as a
reminder that the human race might
have seen better days, Dr. Watkins
points out some of the problemssof
our great civilization. These are a
few questions that trouble him, that
perhaps trouble you.

Criticizes Tariff

“It seems that our government
spends thousands of dollars, through
the Department of Commerce, foster-
ing international trade, and then
erects barriers to prevent that trade,"
Dr. VVatkins said. And, just to prove
that all our legislationvis not the best
work of the Congressional genii, he
adds a.s an example another brain
child of America's law-givers. Since
we are attempting to conserve our
natural resources, we put a tariff on
petroleum to discourage the importa-
tion of foreign oil. That is an eco-
nomical phenomenon.

Here are a few more products of
the ﬂights of fancy indulged in by
our business leaders and ﬁnancial
giants. As Dr, Watkins said, “Our
railroads suffer from too great a bur-
den of ﬁxed charges, so we lend them
more money at 6 per cent interest

the one you must take if you wouldl

In an address made a short time-

Rampant

- Among Our Law-Makers

 

through the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation.” He also pointed out
that our great minds at Washington
Iemploy trained accountants to verify
I our petty cash funds, and then we buy
',$250,000,000 worth of bonds from .the
late Ivan Krueger without checking
the collateral.
Economic Conference Foolish

Lastly, Dr. Watkins gives us an ex-
ample that can be construed as a rea-
son for never aspiring to be senator,
congressman, or other such impedi-
ments to economic progress. It
seems that those who hold the holy
sceptors and cause things to happen,
have organized a world economic con-
ference to prescribe for the world's

leconomic ills, but insist that tariff
barriers and’ waridebts be disregard-
ed. Just as logically, they have lent
money to Germany so that she can
pay her reparations to the Europeans
Allies, who can not pay us because
they are “broke.”

As a parting reminder to you that
economic questions can fool us part
of the time, that we‘ fool with them
most of the time, and that we dissect
lthem woefully all the time, we offer

 

We sell foreigners more goods than
theycan pay for, and thenlend them
the money with which to pay us.

And so, we all shake hands, sigh
once or twice, and agree that we are
all—crazy.
