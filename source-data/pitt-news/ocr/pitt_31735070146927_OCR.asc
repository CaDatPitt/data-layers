SGB approved $30,500 for the Collegiate
Readership Program last night, despite rec-
ommendations from the Board’s allocation

‘committee to deny the request in full.

The program——— scheduled to begin in
January —- will bring 300 printed copies of
both the New York Times and USA Today
to campus each day. Free online access for
all students will alsobe available through
Pitt’s portal once The New York Times starts
charging fees for online access next year.

Earlier this year, SGB President Charlie,

Shull could not convince the Pitt Program
Council to split some of the cost for the Read-
ership Program, which caused him to doubt

that the program could be arranged.

“This is something we have been talking
about since March, butthought was dead in
the water,” Shull said.

Kyle Miller, executive director for PPC,

V attended and showed his personal support

for the program. I.

“While it is beyond the scope for PPC to
pay for such a program, I fully support it,”
Miller said. = ‘

Other Board members also spoke in sup-
port. Board member Molly Stieber said the
fact that the program will offer online access
to The New York Times makes the relatively
high cost worthwhile. Originally, some Board
members voiced concern that the number of

, copies included in the program would only

beneﬁt a small percentage of students.
Zachary Bombatch said he originally op-

posed the idea of having two “extremely
liberal publications” available on campus.
After speaking with the College Republicans
‘.— who voiced support for the program ——
and thinking about it further, he said he
realized the news portion will be a great
resource. , O 1

“All will utilize it,” Bombatch said.
“Therefore, I support it in full.”

With no.Board members in opposition,
students can expect to see the program im-
plemented startinglnext semester.

At the end of the ‘meeting, John Hasley
and Kieran O’Leary were formally inducted
to serve as interim Board members for the
rest of the term. The Board selected thetwo
after a special election held last week. Hasley
and O’Leary did not participate as Board
members during the meeting. a

Fifty years ago this week, the ﬁrst televised
debate aired, allowing voters to see the candi-
dates’ faces and beginning a trend that is now
ingrained in local, state and federal politics.

But/as gubernatorial candidates Tom Cor-
bett and Dan Onorato prepare for their debate
next month, new media outlets like YouTube
and Facebook are once again redeﬁning the
face of American elections, Pitt professors
said. _

Professors Gerald Shuster and Barbara
Warnick, both professors of communication,
discussed the 50th anniversary of the ﬁrst
televised debate this week.

“The media environment at the time of

’ the debates made the candidates visually ac-

cessible to the public instead of reading the
newspaper,” Warnick said. '
The‘ﬁrst televised debate, featuringjohn
F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, aired on Sept.
26, 1960. Shuster said Nixon was considered

' a “shoo-in” before thedebate because of his

experience as vice president. ‘ A

But, with the onset of television, candidates
like Nixon now had to be telegenic and image
took over,«Shuster said. ' '

Kennedy spent six_days at his residence in
Florida prior to the event, leaving him well-
tanned, Shuster said. Kennedy also had his
hair trimmed and styled, and his relative Peter
Lawford —- a member of the Rat Pack — ar-
ranged for quality on-camera makeup.

“Nixon enjoyed the ﬂu four days prior to
the scheduled debate,” Shuster said. “He was
pale—looking and lacked the makeup exper-
tise.” ‘ -‘~

Gubernatorial campaigns utilize newmedia

Debate < 1

What unfolded was not only a stark con-
trast on camera, with a cool-looking Ken-
nedy against a perspiring Nixon, but a new
precedent for future politicians — televised
debates. Overnight, television became the
norm for politicians of every level.

Fifty years later, the American people still
watch televised debates though the practice
has changed‘ signiﬁcantly since its incep-
tion.

“After the ﬁrst debate, it stopped being a
debate,” Shuster said. “Now the rules are so
tight. The spontaneity was taken outwith time
limits and commercial breaks.”

The debate between Corbett and Onorato
will be hosted by The Pennsylvania Associa-
tion of Broadcasters, and will air at 7 p.m.

Oct. 17 on WPXI. _

Richard Wyckoff, PAB president, said that
25 stations statewide will show the debate
andjohn Baer, political commentator for the
Philadelphia Daily News, will moderate.

“The debate offers an upfront and personal
look at the candidates in the convenience of
your home,” Wyckoff said. “You can watch
them respond to some hard questions instead
of seeing 30-second political ads orbillboards
and listen and learn about issues that are im-
portant to you.” '

Shuster said the gubernatorial debate
will draw fewer viewers because it will be up
against “football and other TV.”

“A friend of mine once said that watching
local debates is much like ‘watching grass grow

and cars rust,”’ Shuster said. “Often there is
limited interest.” ,

Similar to how the 1960 televised debate
affected campaigns, a new technological tool
has emerged in politics — the use of “new
media” in campaigns. Websites like Facebook
and Twitter played a large role in President
Obama’s 2008 victory.

“The Internet is now used to mobilize‘

groups and gain constituents whether through
social networks or blogging, etc,” Warnick
said.

V Kelli Roberts, new media director for Cor-
be_tt, explained how the Corbett campaign is
using this new democratic tool. Roberts said
the Corbett campaign uses a website, a Face-
book fan page, Twitter and online resources

designed to bring in volunteers. ;

“It allows us to make the campaign more
personal, provide these resources without a
ﬁlter — person to person contact,” Roberts
said of using new media. “We can feel what
issues are affecting Pennsylvanians.”

The Onorato campaign is also using new-
media tools. Ali Rozell, director of online
strategy for Onorato, said in ‘an e-mail the
campaign has been using You'I‘ube, Facebook,
Twitter and e-mail to reach out to voters.

Rozell said new media facilitates a “‘rapid
response’ to occurrences during campaigns.”
Because regular press is slow, new media pro-
vides fast information that would otherwise
take a much longer time to reach an audi-
ence. I

Film examines Japanese modernization

Pitt emeritus professor recounts 50 years of anthropological research among native Japanese

Stacy Teierle
For The Pitt News

After spending nearly 50 years visiting and
researching Mizusawa, Japan, former Pitt
professor Keith Brown established many
enduring relationships with the people who

lived there.

Whereas many of those friends showed
admiration for his work studying modern-
ization and westernization among farmers,

merchants and former samurai who eventu-

ally earned him an award from the emperor,
some had a few complaints.
One such man voiced his complaint in

the 2010 documentary “Can’t Go Native?”
screened last night in the Frick Fine Arts
Auditorium. “He never brought me any co-
eds,” the man said. ,
Beyond the jest,lthe man’s words re-
ﬂect an important feature of the ﬁlm and
Western—Japanese relationships in general
— foreign societies are not always quite as

foreign as many people tend to believe.

Brown, an emeritus professor of anthro-
pology and former department head at Pitt,
discussed this sentiment in an interview
before the screening. He said that theJapa—
nese are “not the economic animals we used
to talk about. Not the rigid robots. Not the
madame butterﬂies. They laugh when we
laugh, cry when we cry.”

He does not want audiences, however, to
mistake the similarities as a loss ofJapanese
culture. J 5

“A farm boy from Iowa cannot go to Mi-
zusawa and assume farmers there have the
same way of thinking about things,” Brown
said in the ﬁlm. .

The ﬁlm went on to depict the ceremo-
nies and festivals associated with traditional
Japanese society and also addressed the way
a changing economy affected daily life as
much or more than Western inﬂuences. It
also re—examines the idea that in order to
reach modernization, a country will ﬁrst
assimilate to Western lifestyles.

When Brown began his graduate dis-
sertation in 1961, he chose Japan because
itwas the only non—Western, modern soci-
ety. Today, he believes that the country and
its people have not surrendered to purely
Western ideals.

“Japan is still very much Japan. My
friends are still very much Japanese, even
though they go to McDonald’s,” he said.

David Plath produced “Can’t Go Native?”
and provided a reason for his participation
in the ﬁlm. He wanted to not only expose
audiences to a different culture, but also
the ﬁeld of anthropology and the ﬁeldwork
of Brown.

“Though set in Japan, it’s just as much
about anthropology,” Plath, emeritus pro-
fessor of anthropology and Asian studies at
the University of Illinois, said in reference
to the ﬁlm.

At 56 minutes, the documentary followed
a unique structure. Plath divided the ﬁlm
into several short, nearly independent sec-
tions so that instructors can show only the
part or parts that they wish to discuss in
class.

Plath said that reactions from audiences
have proved “overwhelmingly positive from
all types_of people.”

That response has in part motivated
Plath, along with a colleague and some Mi-
zusawa residents, to plan another docu-
mentary. The next ﬁlm will focus more on
the residents’ ideas instead of Brown’s. They
want to share how having an anthropologist
around for so long affected their lives.

Plath recognized the importance of such
academic pursuits. “I hope that it may en-
courage people think about the bigger ques-
tions,” he said. I

Habitat for Humanity spreads awareness

Week—l0ng Habi—Shack campaign promotes homelessness awareness withfree hot dogs and custom— painted cornhole sets.

Mallory Grossman
Staﬁ” Writer

Habitat for Humanity hoped that build-

ing a house on the William Pitt Union lawn '

would remind students of all those without
homes.
Pitt’s chapter of the humanitarian organi-

zation built the structure as part of its annual ‘

Habi-Shack campaign, an effort to spread
awareness about substandard housing and
homelessness in America and abroad. This
year’s campaign will run through the end
of the week. ‘

Dan Murphy, afﬁliate liaison and volun-
teer coordinator for.Habitat for Human-
ity, said the shack was put on a prominent
place on campus to spread awareness about
Habitat’s mission of bringing affordable
and sustainable housing to struggling and

_ homeless people.

Throughout the week, Habitat members
will host various activities in front of the
shack, including a free—hot-dog day this
afternoon, which president _]._]. Krais said
always draws a crowd. The group will also
take orders for custom painted cornhole
sets from individuals or organizations and a
limited number of pre—made sets are avail-
able for purchase today.

Krais said the shack was also built to
paint a picture of how some people who are
less fortunate actually live.

Becky_ Mason, a freshman, recently
joined Pitt’s Habitat for Humanity aﬁ:er
visiting its booth at the Activities Fair.

“I just think it’s a nice thing to do for
people,” Mason said. .

Habitat for Humanity holds various
activities throughout the school year, in-
cluding fundraisers, social events, local
volunteering and spring break trips.

In the coming months, the organization
intends to partner with Alpha Kappa Psi,‘
a business fraternity at Pitt, to host a ﬂag
football tournament and fundraiser. Around
Christmas time, Krais said Pitt students
should to look out for a gingerbread house-

. making night.

“This is a fun social event that gets stu-
dents out to see what Habitat is all about.
They get to build houses that they can actu-
ally eat,” Krais said.

The o_rganization’s main event is its.
spring beneﬁt concert. The concert includes

three local bands, free food, raffles and . '

Along with holding fundraisers, the
organization tries to send students out to

local volunteer projects every weekend. .

Groups of so to 60 people go to neigh-
borhoods around Pittsburgh to help build
and repair houses, Krais said. The orga-
nization works on at least two to three
houses each weekend.

Farming for wind
won’t solve it all

The waves crash. The sun beams. The hori-
zon beckons ahead. The grandeur of endless,
pristine ocean calms the worried soul  Oh
yeah, just forget about that row of gigantic
stainless—steel rotating turbines.

The above scenario wouldn’t exactly strike
students as an ideal beach-going adventure.
As Cape Cod residents would surely tell you,
there’s something aesthetically different about
abeach utilizing off-shore wind farms. Adding
a vertical axis to a typically horizontal ocean
can be unsettling for those resistant to equate
scenic beauty with 90-degree angles.

But given our destructive addiction to for-

" eign oil and the now very realized ecological

danger associated with off-shore drilling —
oh come on, don’t forget about the Gulf oil
spill already —— perhaps we should redeﬁne
what makes beach scenery beautiful. Blow,
blow thou nautical wind, but please do so
carefully. . V .

The fact is, off-shore wind farms offer
an exciting,,though limited, potential as an
energy alternative, especially for states bor-
dering the Atlantic Ocean. A report released
yesterday by the conservation advocacy group
Oceana suggests the East Coast could reap
enormous beneﬁt from taking advantage of
the strong winds of the Atlantic. Using meth-

ods derived from environmental researchers «

at the University of Delaware, Oceana calcu-
lates that once fully implemented, a compre-
hensive system of wind turbines could gener-
ate 48 percent of the electricity needs of the
top 11 coastal states with the best wind.

For those who now stop at fewer BP gas '

stations after the Deepwater Horizon ﬁasco or
those who cringe at the human rights abuses
of major U.S. oil‘ providers, this new study
might feel like a call to action. If you happen to
be one of these people, cool down. As exciting

as harnessing maritime winds sounds, more
information must be gathered before the state
or federal governments commit billions of
American tax dollars to‘ it.

In light of a second report released yes-
terday on the topic of wind farms, we just
don’t want to waste what’s sure to become a
national effort. The report, published by the
UK’s Energy Research Center, found that the
massive offshore wind project already under-
way in the seas surrounding the British Isles is
burning lots of cash —— and you thought green
alternatives didn’t emit CO2 — according to
the Daily Mail. And it gets worse, the cost of
maintaining the off—shore wind farms cur-
rently installed is nearly twice that of main-
taining more traditional gas power plants. In
terms of cents per kilowatt produced, that’s
24 cents instead of 13 cents. Talk about inef-
ﬁciency. _

When combined with the fact that wind
is not constant — i.e. you inevitably would
need back-up plants for especially stagnant
days — it’s clear that wind power, particularly
in its off-shore form, is only one part of a much
larger energy solution. _

But who’s to say more efficient turbines
won’t be built by ﬁiture civil and mechanical
engineers —— Pitt’s Swanson School of Engi-

neering has graduated more than 10,000 of A
. them so far, according to its website. Although

it might be hard to imagine off—shore wind’s
beneﬁts outweighingits costs with current
technology and construction methods, in-
novation might change that.

So the next time you ﬁnd yourself near
some great body of water, see if you can men-
tally insert "a couple rotating blades among
the waves without losing appreciation for

the scene. Because the wind farms will come ’

anyway. I

Autumn is almosthere, and all of you college

to be something of a minor league, the NBA

always goes to the Los Angeles Lakers, a team
that has carved out a niche asjack Nicholson’s
favorite team. '

WWE: Once a lurid spectacle heavily de-
pendent on the star power of peroxide~blond
behemoth “Hulk” Hogan, the WWE has since
lost much of its audience to more competitive
sports like Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest
and the World Series of Poker. Nowadays, the
WWE limps along as an entertainment outlet
for juggalos and the handful of deluded view-
ers who still believe that this “sport” is real. It
also has a division that consists of “divas” who
engage in pillow ﬁghts and shaving-cream-
battles royale, so if a monthly publication like
Maxim is out of your price range, this might
be a good fallback.  .

UFC: The UFC is abone—shatterif1g, skull-_

busting organization that has gone rogue and
as a consequence become popular with people
who wear TapouT T—shirts.— Some of the top
UFC players include that guy from the recent
“A-Team” movie, that guy from .“Dancing with
the Stars” and that guy who knocked outthat
other guy’s eye in a famous YouTube video.
NASCAR: We think this one’s still hap-
pening in the winter. Have you ever watched
it before? The cars go round and round the
track, there are a bunch of wrecks, and some-
one wins a handful of points. If you have the

51% "{{€}~'

   
 

most points at the end of the year, you win the

Sprint Cup. Nextel Cup? Winston Cup? They i

change the name of this trophy more often
than we change our pants. Judging from the
number of times she has appeared in abikini,
Danica Patrick seems to be leadingrin this

  

category. Based on the same criterion, Dale
Earnhardt, Jr., is second.
~ PGA: Here’s one for those of you who en-

V joy long afternoon naps. The golf season,

which runs from .1982 until the present, is
built around the idea that Tiger Woods is in-
vincible. There are bunches of no-names who
compete against him, but even Phil Mickelson

and his magniﬁcent man-boobs — “moobs,” .

for short — can’t stop juggernaut. In fact,

was revealed a few months ago that he makes
the same kind of mistakes as the rest of us.
Once we learned about this, we asked for a
refund from a sporting goods store for our
$49.95 Nike Dri—Fit golf shirt. Our request was
refused, and the hurt still hasn’t gone away.
Fantasy Football: Because it combines
the thrill of football with the painlessness of
“fantasy,” the nerds love this one. Although
fantasy football doesn’t have one official sanc-

tioningbody, there’s no doubt that it has taken .

the world. by storm. For years, procrastinat-
ing students and ofﬁce drones didn’t have
anything to do with all of their down time.
Keeping track of a backup running back for

I the Minnesota Vikings just didn’t make a lot

of sense when you had paper clips to ﬁdget
with and water coolers to stand around.
Thanks to the invention of fantasy football,
these folks now have a reason to follow the
performances of forgettable players and dis-

appointing teams. Every game matters, if

only on account of the statistics that game’s

‘ ‘participants will produce. Rumor has it that
V there’s a new version of fantasy football in

the works, a “fantasy fantasy draft,” where
participants will spend all season updating
their draft boards and win points based on
how closely their predictions correspond to

those of Mel Kiper,]r.

We know that it’s hard to_ pull yourself
away from a college football game with as
much history behind it as Connecticut-South
Florida, but do remember that there are lots
of other great sports out there. Whereas the
NBA can’t compete with the college game in
terms of ineligible players, it certainly has
produced its share of memorable arrests. The

PGA has given us plenty of useful white noise .

as well as lots of different moisture—resistant
garments. Even sports that we didn’t have
time to discuss in detail, like beer pong and
horseshoes, have their merits; Once you begin
to explore all these national pastimes, you will
be well on yourway to becoming the kind of
informed citizen who can stay competitive in
any game of bar trivia. And that’s what life is
all about, right‘?

Pittsburgh proves it has style

Anna Weldon
Staﬁ Writer

Stereotypes say Pittsburgh isn’t chic, but
one group is determined to refute that idea
by hosting the Steel City’s ﬁrst Fashion
Week. .

“It’s long overdue,” said LaMont]ones,
the event’s assistant director and market-
ing manager. “Pittsburgh deserves Fashion
Week.”

The inaugural bash kickedoff this week
with an event called “Clearing for Takeoff
— Destination Fashion Oz,” which took
place in the Southside Works square. Fea-
tured were stores EB Pepper, Jupe, Sugar,
Roberta Weissburg Leathers, The Planet
Pulse; and designers M] Whalen and Iro-
Neice by Kari Kramer.

Fashion shows and auctions will be
held almost every night through Saturday
starting between 6 and 8 p.m. at locations
throughout the city. Tickets range from
$10 to $40. a

The week will end with a $40 brunch at
the Omni William Penn Hotel, Downtown,
on Sunday.

The week features different design-
ers every day to help give them exposure
and promote their work. Jones said the
increased attention during this week will
give designers the opportunity to become
better known in the community. Not only
will designers have the chance for success
during the week, shoppers and boutiques
can scope out designers, aiding them in
selling more. —

“I’m extremely pleased that part of Fash-
ion Week elevates the design and retail in
Pittsburgh,” said Carrie Butler, the direc-
tor of public relations at the Art Institute
of Pittsburgh.

The Art Institute teamed up with Pitts-
burgh’s Fashion Week as a sponsor to
better include students into the action.
Jones stressed that the event is not only
for fashionistas, up—and—coming designers
and models — the event also tries to help
students participate. Many of the events
offer discounted tickets for students. V

The “Thrifty Pass for Students,” which
can be found on Pittsburgh Fashion Week’s
website, pittsburghfashionweek.com, pro-
Vided access to Monday night’s show, as
well as full access this Friday and Saturday.
Still, all tickets will be sold at the door to
both students and the general public.

On Saturday morning, there will be
a design contest for students. Both high
school and college students are invited to
join the competition. Students will work

High school and college students will have the opportunity to show off their styling
skills using trash bags sduring the Saturday competition. The Pitt News experimented

only with two black trash bags, two white
trash bags and duct tape to complete a
design in an hour. .
The contest is titled “Treasure and the
Trash Design Off.” The winner of the con-
test gains recognition for his or her design,
as well as thetitle of Pittsburgh’s next top

on business staff member Aly Stiles.

Saturday runway shows and a gift basket.

Registration costs $10 and begins at

to Downtown. The competition is open
to all students who want to show off their
design skills. I ‘

Food and fashion
collide for show

I Natalie Bell
A&E Editor

“EAT ME Fashion Show”

Future Tenant

819 Penn Ave. —
10 p.m. (Doors open at 9:30 p.m.)
(412) 325-7037

Tickets $15

The phrase “eat me” takes on a whole
new connotation when you’re wearing a
marshmallow minid-ress or a pair of kale
pants. '

Tomorrow night, Future Tenant will
serve up flavorful fashion made out of
food at its EAT ME Fashion Show, fea-
turing five individual designers and four
organizations who each created their own
edible garment. I

“This is the first time I’ve made a fash-
ionidesignvwith food and it’s sticky. It’s re-
ally sticky,” saidjill Larson, independent
curator and designer of the marshmallow
dress. 7
As a visual artist, Larson‘ has been
incorporating edibles into her work for
about a decade. She was the curator for the
current exhibit at Future Tenant: EAT ME,
whichgfepatured art pieces made of food.
So when Orvokki Halme, co-executive
directorof Future Tenant, cooked up the
idea to have a fashion showduring Pitts-
burgh’s Fashion Week, she got in touch
with Larson and they decided food was
the perfect medium.

“We thought it would be fun to  sort
of piggy back on Pittsburgh Fashion Week,
kind of do a more art version of the,run—
way show,” Halme said.

Halme will participate on behalf of
Future Tenant. She and Co—executive Di-
rector Laura Zorch will craft a vest from
cornhusks and pants made out of kale, a
form of cabbage, for the show. They’ve
been planning since the summer, but they
haven’t been able to assemble everything
early due to the perishable nature oftheir
materials. '_ _

Halme explains that most of the de-
signers have waited until the last minute
to avoid losing their garments to the perils
of rotting, mold and vermin. But, this
means that the trial—and—error process
of things like kale pants can be extremely
difﬁcult.

“Sometimes when I get frustrated, I
find myself eating my design,” Larson
said.

' Future T enant’s show will show off clothes made of food

Food is a difficult material and often
difficult to use on its own. Participants can
opt to use fabric —— for example, Halme
and Zorch glued the kale to apair of long
underwear —— but the fabric can’t be vis-

ible. Larso'n’s frustrations might be all the .

greater considering therewill be nothing
between her model, Kate! Little, and the
marshmallows. I

“So having never worked with,marsh- .

mallows before other than roasting them

over aﬁre, I didn’t anticipate thatall the '4 ‘ ' "  '
goo inside them wants to come out  My I

model, Kate, -is going to be sticky,” Lar-
son said. a  ‘  ' V

But, Little, who will also model the
dress for Quantum Theater, isn’t con-
cerned aboutstickiness. She’s more wor-
ried about the obvious difficulty of wear-
ing something made from food.

“I think it would probablyhave to be
handled more delicately as not to harrnthe
article of clothing. I’m afraid food
not be as resilient as other materifals.
That’s my biggest concern. I donft know

if it’s possible to rip a dress of marshmal-.

lows, but I think it must be possible,”E—.:$_he

_ said. ‘

Once theshow is done, models areal-
lowed to walk around in their delectable
dresses. Little muses thatshe might have

friends trying to steal bites of ,herc"én- —

semble and even she admits she might be
tempted to nibble. "

“I have_a sweet tooth. Unless there’s a
whole lot of toxic glue on my dress, I’ll be

tempted to "eat it,” she said, adding that“: e If

she wouldn’t munch without permission

because she’d hate to “compromise the

art.” . - . - »
The night of the actual show, the*'§le—
signers will be in a ﬂurry backstagefjto
put their models in the delicate fashioijs.
Brett Johnson Salon will do the models’
makeup andhair. Manydesigners 
share models and Halme said only brie

After the show, cocktails and delecta—_

ble edibles will be served. But don’t expect
any of this to be normal fare.‘Megan Gillis
will provide cupcakes shaped like women’s
breasts and the other munchies will have
similar themes to them. I

_ I “The foodthatwill be served will be... .

shaped like people, the EAT ME fashion

The movie chronicling the plight of owl warriors is a fantastical story with striking 3-D visuals, but has a typical hero plot‘.

3-D has become Hollywood’s_ newest
ﬂashy technology, drawing in crowds with
the promise of something beautiful to
look at. But the visuals in a ﬁlm cannot
promise a good story.

Fortunately, “Legend of the Guard-

complete story on its own,.and its 3-D ‘

visuals only add to the movie. The movie

follows the typical underdog—becomes—
a—hero story, except thatall the main
characters are owls. It’s loosely based
on a novel series by Kathryn Lasky, and
the ﬁlm combines the plot of three out
of her 15 novels.

“Guardians” tells the story of a young
barn owl named Soren. He grew up lis-
tening to the tales about the Guardians

of Ga’Hoole, a group of owl warriors who

once saved the land from a power-hungry

gang known as the Pure Ones.
Overnight, Soren, his brother Kludd
and other owlets are captured and taken

from their peaceful home by surviving"

Pure Ones._They are told they are orphans
who will be raised into soldiers, and any
who do not accept the new.law and are
ungrateful enough to turn away their new
family are made into‘ slaves.

Soren and new friend Gylﬁe manage
to learn how to ﬂy and escape with the
help of one _Pure One who was forced into.
working for the cause to saye his family.
However, Soren’s brother embraces the
law of his captors and exceeds as a soldier
in their ranks. Soren seeks out the Guard-
ians’ home at the Great Tree, collecting
followers as he travels and searches for
something of which he has no proof but
still believes exists. _ .

Throughout the ﬁlm, audiences should
be prepared to enter a fantasy land. Here,
owls can harness ﬁre, wear masks, carry
weapons and use magic found in metal to
trap their enemies. The Guardians come
off as knights, ﬁghting the evil in the land

and living by an honor code '—_ not living »

for the glory but ﬁghting because it is
their duty. Loyalty is respected, sacriﬁce
is necessary and doing the right thing
rewards the just; ‘ . . .

The soundtrack contributes to the im-
age of evil taking over the land. With the

’ exceptionof one song by Owl City, most of
 the score lacks in lyrics and captures the

‘feeling of going into battle and ﬁghting
"an enemy, even when weak and suppos-
edly helpless. . ‘

There is a blatant idea that the power-

hungry Pure Ones, who believe in survival '

of the ﬁttest and enslaving the weak to do
their bidding, are ﬂat~out wrong. And al-

most every character that comes into con- .

tact with the enemy is corrupted, except
for the dreamer Soren. All things consid-
ered, this movie is darker than expected,

_ launching straight from a peaceful land

into a terrifying tyrannical culture.

And it can’t be avoided: The visuals "

are stunning. The team that worked on
‘Happy Feet” was brought in for this ﬁlm,
and it seems its past experience animat-
ing birds beneﬁted this new film. There

are elegant, detailed close-ups of feathers ‘

and rain, stark deﬁnitions in objects and
fantastic backgrounds enhanced by 3-D.

The colors are vibrant and the lighting K
and shading. work perfectly to set the

"tone and mood. . _
Guardians is simple, enjoyable fun:

It’s predictable, but beautiful, telling a

story that has been told time and again

because people love to hear itand love '

to retell it. There are «sure to be sequels,
and with work and luck they will be as

enjoyable as — and perhaps even better ~
than .—. this film.

Staff Writer

I-n its ﬁrst tournament of the season, the
Pitt women’s tennis team boasted victo-
ries in both singles and doubles play, and
freshmen and sophomores accounted for
several of the wins. '

This past weekend, the Panthers de-
buted their fall schedule at the Women’s
Eastern Collegiate Invitational held in West
Point, N.Y.

“We took the team to a very good tourna-
ment this weekend. We were a strong team
going in with good players, faced great
competition and came away‘ with great
results,” head coach George Dieffenbach
said. . ‘

Four Panthers played in singles play,
and two Pitt doubles teams competed at

Dieffenbach said. “[]ocelyn] embraced the
challenge and did her best. It was a good

ment.”

Senior Adela Aprodu_swept her competi-
tion 6-0, 6-0 in the ﬁrst round and went
on to defeat Sarah Viebrock, the No. 3 seed
from Quinnipiac.

But, she lost to WestlVirginia’s Melis

Pitt’s No. 1 doubles team of freshman
Kimmy Borza and sophomore Karma Parb-
hu defeated West Virginia’s doubles team
but later lost to Fairleigh Dickinson’s team
by a margin of 8-4.

Elizabeth Adams kicked off singles play
for the Panthers as the No. 6 seed and came
from behind in the ﬁrst—round match to —
defeat her Long Island opponent by a score
of 10-1 in the tiebreaker. ‘

She then took on Fordham’s Angie Dabu

-and again won the tiebreaker 10-5.

-“I think positivity is the main key, and
Eve learned that throughout my collegiate
career. I was down in both of my matches, A
but I was able to come back and win. It’s not

“This year our team is much more close-

with morale. Our goal for the fall is for
everyone to get some good wins and to get
a lot of experience for the spring, especially
for the freshmen,” Adams said.

“There is less pressure in the fall than
in the spring season. The goal is for every
player to improve, become more aggressive

2004, when he became the ﬁrst quarterback

The Pitt football team needs a leader. That
much became painfully clear after the 31-3
throttling the Panthers took at the hands of
the Miami Hurricanes last Thursday.

With the slew of off the ﬁeld problems,
including legal issues and Pitt’s performance
on the ﬁeld, I doubt I’m the only one wonder-
ing who is going to step into a leadership role
this season. ’ 4

During the Miami game, Mick Williams,
Gus Mustakas and Bill Stull were recognized
on the ﬁeld for the Meineke Car Care Bowl
victory last season. Watching them stand on
the sideline, one thing became obvious: this
year’s Panthers don’t have a leader the caliber
‘of any of those former players.

Say what you want about Bill Stull, and as ‘

far as I can tell, Pitt fans either lovedhim or
hated him; but here’s one thing nobody can
deny: Stull was a leader. Think back on the
Connecticut game last season, when Pitt was
trailing the Huskies 21-6 late in the fourth
quarter. ' . ’
Stull threw two touchdown passes to even
the game, oneof which included asuccessful
two-point conversion pass to Cedric McGee.
He then led the Panthers on the game—winning
drive that ﬁnished with a Dan Hutchins’ ﬁeld

' goal.

Perhaps mostiimportantly, the team recog-

to throw ﬁve touchdown passes against na-
tionally ranked Notre Dame. He completed
26—of—42 passes for 334 yards, leading to a
game—winning ﬁeld goal with one second
left.

Like Stull, Palko was theunquestioned
leader of his Pitt football team. He was the
ﬁeld general in every sense of the phrase.

Those teams were exactly that: a team.
This year’s squad seems more like a bunch

. of individual players who all happen to wear

the same uniform. One of those players needs
to be a uniﬁer.

A leader doesn’t have to come in the form
of a quarterback, either — think Scott McKil-
lop or Williams and Mustakas. Whoever it’s
going to be this year, he needs to 'speak'up
fast, before the season and hopes for a Big
East Championship slip away.

Greg Romeus could have been that leader
for the Panthers this season, but his back
surgery took that option away, at least for
a while.

Tino Sunseri is young: a redshirt'sopho—
more starting for the ﬁrst time. But he’s also

the quarterback, anaturalleadership posi— A

tion, and he’s expressed that he is comfortable
stepping into that leadership role.'Maybe his

Senior defensive end Jabaal Sheard will look to help get the Panthers back on track. Kirschman 4 13

EH9:

conﬁdence was shaken over the ﬁrst three
games, but as a coach’s son, I have a feeling
he’ll bounce back.

He showed sparks of performingas a leader
during the Utah game and played well against
New Hampshire, but he’s not a general like
Stull or Palko yet. Once he ﬁnds his way to
that position, some of Pitt’s ship might right
itself, but some Panther upperclassmen need
to step up as well.

Wannstedt met with his seniors after the
game against Miami, making it clear that some
of the younger players needed to be reminded
about the levels of commitment and dedica-
tion needed to meet their goals this season.

Having a need for a meeting like that three
games into the season is troubling.

Some of the post—game quotes were even
more troubling. ‘

“We have tremendous players, but we have
to play as a team,” Pitt senior Jabaal Sheard
said. “I don’t know what the problem is, but
we have to ﬁnd out and we have to ﬁx it.”

He added: “We need to come together as
a team right now. The most important thing
is that we have to play as a team. We need to
support one another. It’s a team game.”

This is a lesson the Panthers should have
learned in the offseason, and it speaks volumes
about the problems Pitt is having — both on
and off the ﬁeld.

Sheard was one of the Panthers who strug-
gled with legal troubles -— he pleaded guilty
to disorderly conduct this summer-— but
the senior seems willing to step into a vocal
leadership role now. ‘ '

“For myself, I need to just practice harder,”
he said. “I’m not the most vocal player, but if
I have to step up I will.”

That’s exactly what Pitt needs: an older
player to take control and offer direction who’s
not afraid to speak up. Somebody needs to
gather the troops and remind the Panthers
that football isa team sport. T

They are going to have to come together
as a team if they are going to ﬁnish the season
successﬁilly. They’ll also have to ﬁnd a way to
get past the off—the-ﬁeld distractions.

Pitt has a relatively young football team
that seems to have lost its identity. That iden-
tity can be found in the form of a player that
teammates can talk about after the game and
say, “That’s our leader. There’s no question.”

Here’s hoping the Panthers ﬁnd him -
and soon. I .
