Survey Shows Lack Of

Women Administrators

by CHRIS CIEPLY

Only two women now hold Uni-
versity positions at the. level of
dean or above. according to the
latest available listing of acade-
mic deans and members ‘of the
Chancellor‘s staff.

Despite recent high turnover
intop administrative posts. white
males occupy all but six of the
positions. Four black males-
Dr.- Edward Blakely, Dr. Donald
Henderson, Dr. James Kelly and
Dr. Alfred Moye—are on the
Chancellor‘s staff. ‘The two wom-
en. Anne Pascasio and Enid Gold-
berg, are deans of the schools of
Health Related Professions and
Nursing, respectively.

' Available lists of assistants to
these administrators show the
same pattern of a lack of women.
Associate deans are overwhelm-
ingly male, as are assistant vice-
chancellors. Where women do
hold such positions, they are in
traditionally female areas such as
nursing. '

The situation is not unique to
Pitt.‘ A survey of 94 universities
of the. National Association of
State Universities and Land-Grant

« Colleges showed that women in

high-ranking positions are still
rare. and that most are in mid-
.dle-management jobs or tradi-
tional female-directed fields.

Reasons for the situation at Pitt
are complex. Dr. Marcia Landy.
president of the University Sen-
ate. maintains that the problem's
root is at the undergraduate lev-
el.

‘ “I see instances of the pressure
put on excellent women students
whichdiscourages them from go-
ing as far as they could,” said
Landy. -“They don’t go on to get
advanced degrees. Thus, we get

posts.

fewer womeif professors to draw
on for faculty positios. There’s
a problem of tenuring women,
too, since the only ones who stick
around are those with tenure.”

Landy noted that financial and

budgetary jobs are the ones in
which the "male establishment"

,most tends to ‘perpetuate itself.

"It may be true that there aren't
qualified women to fill these
jobs, ‘but the answer is to hire
more and train more so there will
be more. The reason we're at a
standstill is that the University
isn‘t working on the total picture.
It's more than just a question of
finding competent women."

Karen Farber of the Affirma-
tive Action Program. which pro-
motes equal opportunity in Uni-
versity employment procedures.
noted that because most adminis-
trative vacancies are filled

* through faculty search commit-

tees. Affirmative Action person-
nel cannot directly influence
the choice of people to fill the
"Our ‘say-so’ is -mainly
in non-faculty areas." she said.
Farber explained that when fac-
ulty positions become available, it
is the department’s responsibility
to notify Affirmative Action
through special form cards which

are distributed to every Univer-

sity department. Her office then
goesto work to find persons who
would be eligible. ‘

In non-faculty areas. said Far-
ber. Affirmative Action units
exist for every‘University depart-
ment. She noted that many of the
units have put together clear-cut
plans that “look excellent—at
least on paper." and cited the li-
brary as the best example. "We

Playhouse Fights Finances

by DAVE MAJERNIK
The Pittsburgh Pla_yhouse is
currently suffering from severe
financial ills.

“We’re alive, well, but shaky, V‘
and doing our damndest to stay

open,” said James Yeiser, general
manager of the Playhouse. I

Sandra Mellon. director of pro-

motion and public relations agrees.

"Were fighting for our,life."
she said. "Were working with a
reduced staff. we have all gotten
pay cuts. and many of us are work-
ing 12 hours a day.“

Due to financial difficulties
at Point Park College (to which
the Playhouse was affiliated un-
til recently). the Craft Avenue
theater has decided to go on
alone. ’

Yeiser explained the move.
“We will still provide Point Park
with a theatre arts department,
but now our administration will
be separate from Point Park's.”

Asked to give -reasons for the
theater's_.current g"probl_emsg. the

I

 

   

‘Playhouse officials replied that

theater. likeiother cultural insti-
tutions such as the museum. art
gallery. symphony. and ballet.
cannot support itself and must
depend on subsidy from charita-
ble foundations and industry.
Ticket sales pay for less than half
the production costs. they said.
"The financial crisis is a con-

stant problemgbut every once in a ,

while it catches up to us." said
Yeiser.
Poor attendance is not a

‘ factor. During the past four years

said Yeiser, attendance has in-
creased. ‘

Mellon contended that the Play-
house provides many services for
iarea college students and there-
fore deserves their support. ’

First. there is the student dis-
count for the main productions.
On Sunday..Tuesday. Wednesday.
and Thursday. student admission
is $2.25 in contrast to $3.50 regu-
lar admission. On Friday: stud-

ae ¥,ls<imiss10ni.s.~.$2«5.9 .Whil%..r9€".- 

  
 

ular admission is $5.50. There are
no student rates on Saturday.

“The Playhouse provides the
cheapest date in town,” said Mel-
len. “even the moviehouses

"charge more than we do.”

When students come-in groups.
the rate is even lower. Many
English and theatre arts classes
from Pitt and CMU attend pro-
ductions at reduced prices. she
said. ‘

"We also provide free public
lectures to area college students

‘when visiting theatre dignitaries

are in town.“ said Meliosn. "For
example. last season contempor-
ary playwright Israel Horowitz.
give a lecture when his play Al-
fred The Great was being pro-
duced here." ‘

Another feature at the Play-
house is the film festival which
brings in popular films at the re-
duced admission of $1.50.

Films scheduled for the sum-
mer festival include) l/\Io(Way‘To,

Professor Emmanuel, Anise. ques-
tioning this procedure, and the
DBCERD faculty met again to

reconsider their decision. After a '

series of six procedural questions
had been agreed upon by the

' faculty. a new vote was taken.

Porter was again approved by
the 16 member faculty in an 11-4
vote. '

Two weeks later. Sowande. a
specialist in African mythology
and religion, was appointed act-
ing chairman by Dean Rosen-
berg.

In a formal statement that was
circulated to various University
organizations and officials, as
_well as Black community organ-
izations. Porter charged the
Dean of FAS. and several DBC-
ERD faculty members “with
irregular handling of the mat-
ter."

“My feeling is that such acti-
vities ,(the appointment of So-
wande) on the part of the Dean
serve to deprive the departmental
collective in the DBCERD of its
human, academic and profession-

I al rights.

"I chargewthat Dean Rosen-
berg has by personal will chosen
to deny the relatively young and
inexperienced (in terms of Uni-

versity procedure) faculty of the -

department of its right to work.
its right to due process, its right
to consideration on such major
issues. its right to academic free-
dom of a kind, and its will in dir-
ecting its own affairs,". contin-
ued Porter.

not wish to "take a position on'.‘‘ i

Rosenberg stated. "One should 
be left to work these things out; 
on an internal basis. I find de-, 
plorable the inflation of the is-
sue both in intensity and geogra- -I ,_
phicalextent." I

ment in the issue. saying “It's 
the people's University, the stud? o ~.
ent press is in the University.
and the department came out ‘of
the community struggle, and so
it is by all means proper to bring
the "conflict to the public.” I

In his statement Porter ac-
cuses Sowande, "in accepting the; ,
mandate of the Dean of FAS over,
that of the faculty of DBCERD
is either knowingly or unknoyv-.3 —
ingly in collusion with this in-‘
tention (the dissolution of the-kt
department) and has /threfore,
either knowingly or unknowingly. 
conspired to submit all of the de~‘ 5'-7
partmental processes to the con-_ 
sidered unchallengable authority‘ 
of the Dean of the FAS." ' 

Sowande., inan interview which
was also attended by Anise and
DBCERD Professor Rollo Turn-
er, said, "I don‘t think that this

raise the price of ticketsto the Greek Week festivities from $2 to $5. '

The action followed a flooridebate.

' mittee member Ira Ditcher.

“Sure you want these things,” Ditcher told IFC President 
. Latterman, “but when you do expensive things, you have to pay for{

them.” ‘

Latterman had rejected the Committee’s proposal to ‘raise the‘
price of Greek Week tickets. Along with President Rege Kauffman’s.
support. Latterman asserted that a price hike would discou'rageV
many Greeks from attending.’ He also told the Board that the expect”-3
ed high turnoutiby non-Greeks (they are invited this year) would pro-.

bably be nullified.

According to the Committee. more money must begenerated 
the participants unless the IFC ‘wishes to cut some of the scheduled,“

led by Allocations Com-ff.

  
   
  

programs. The money is needed to cover $2,700 for entertainm¢ent~,.:V‘:_"',3

$2.145 for hall rentals. and other miscellaneous costs. 
Following the rejection, the Board voted to send the budget back 

to the Allocations Committee with added recommendations: _ _ 
1) Kauffman and others suggested that the ticket -price ' bet; 
raised to $3 instead of the proposed $5. , . _ . '5}:
2) Latterman proposed to cut Fun Day activities which would

add about $350 to the IFC account. V’

In other action, the Board announced the upcoming'installa-:1" 
tion of two University‘ safety features. The first-is the emergency

   

call box which will be set up in dangerous areas throughout the Uni-:.
versity. The other is the installation of peep holes in all d_ormi-'1

In addition to the main pro-

four children’s theatre produc-

"Our artistic policy remains the
same despite‘ the financial crisis.
We will still use Equity (profes-
sional) actors with some Point
Park students in minor roles."
said Yeiser.

Professional actors do not in-
flate the budget as some may
think, he said. First. profession-
als can rehearse much faster.

which saves time. Secondly, he

said, professionals rehearse’ dur-
ing the day while amateurs, who
usually have jobs during the day.

The Playhouse, the second oldest '

celebrating its 40th anniversary

‘next year, provides Pittsburgh

with a much different type of
theatre than a roadshow theater
like the Nixon, according to Yeis-
er.

“We have a compan_v of actors

here and put on all our produc-

goals, and that’s promising
she said. .

A different view of the prob-
lem of women administrators is
held by Susanna Downie of the
English Department. who is ac-
tive in the University Women‘s
Center. "Women who advance
into responsible positions try to
dissociate themselves from other
women." she said. "They have a
stake in the system and they don‘t
want to shake the security of their
position by taking action to help
other women." '

The bookstore’s Affirmative Ac-

is an example. “All the sugges-

tions made by their unit were
subject to veto by Mary, Bonach,
the director. And it’s because
she has her own job to think
about.” Of Farber, Downie said,
“She’s clear about her goals, but
I’m afraid, because she too has a
position to maintain.”

The unwillingness of women to

be aggressive and play the com-.

petitive "game" has also hamper-
ed them. said Downie.

“They have the skills. but not
the politics, and if they're not
outspoken. their superiors will
assume they don't want to get
ahead. 'It‘s prejudice that can be
understood. but it‘s prejudice
nevertheless.“ .

tinued Sowande. '

Anise. who along with Turn-
er had allegedly threatened to‘ re-
sign from participation in depart-
mental activities if Porter was
appointed acting chairman. re-
sponded to statements concern-
ing Sowande‘s appointment.

"I am not committed to letting
these slanders go unchallenged.
and when the correct time comes
I will speak as an individual.
and not as a representative of this
department. In the end the real
enemies of the department and
Black people will be exposed“
said Anise.

Educational Philosophy

Sowandes educational philoso-
phy has also been questioned.

In a memorandum to the facul-
ty of DBCERD. entitled Educa-
tional Philosophy of the Depart-

ment of Black Studies of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, Sowande
outlines "a list of thought-patterns
which I attribute to the Black
Race." He feels these thought-
patterns should become the major
orientation of the department.

“These thought—patterns seem
to me to rest on (a) the inner cer-
tainty that the world we live in
possesses per se. both in its visible
and invisible states a Livingness
that is beyond doubt or any ques-
tion whatever; (b) that in like
manner the individual human
being also possesses this same
Livingness both in his mater-
ial and non-material bodies:

(cl that an organic inter—rela—
tionship exists between the two.
i.e. man and the World he lives
in. at all levels. each influenc-
ing the other subtly but profound-
ly. most intimately and with
practical results the importance
of which can not be overstated.“

IINTIMIDATION i

V by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN

,. This newspaper has, frequently called upon the university coin-
" mhunity to respond to its articles and make use of its pages as a form
;_for student. staff and faculty opinion. Yet we can not help but be
fisurprised when articlesare responded to before they appear uniden-
_,tified persons. or persons who identify themselves as others.

I ‘,The letter which appeared July 11. on page 5 of the Pitt News
=-from Anugo P. Ntukogu..and the article which appears in this issue.
«both dealing with the appointment of a new chairman of the Depart-
ment of Black Community Education. Research and Development
DBCERD), have elicited exactly this kind of response.

--Ntukogo brought his letter -to the PITT NEWS office on July
. While he was in the office a call was received from a woman
-Uwhoiidentified herself as Mrs. Porter, and who asked whether or not
i‘ there had been a letter, whether it would be printed, and when it

As this woman hung up. she made the‘ comment. "Democracy

1" A phone-call was then put into Curtiss l:L. Porter a_ professor in
TEDBCERD. who said point-blank that his wife was at home with
‘him’./and had made no such phone-call.

, After Ntukogo's letter appeared. the paper received early Friday
afternoon. a, call from a male. who refused to identify himself. The
.2 caller simply stated that "this is a very tricky business. so be care-

 Sunday, July 15, this reporter received a phone call at home
from a person, who, like Friday’s caller, refused to identify himself.
The caller wished to know how much work had been done on the
story, and ended his call with this warning, “Just watch out, this
whole thing could blow up in a very big way.” .
~f',Finally on Monday. this reporter was again called at home. at
round ten o'clock in the evening. This caller was a female who
aid; she was calling for Richard Blackett. an instructor ir( DBCERD.
-he -‘caller who was quite friendly. simply stated the "need for deli-

.. Inquiries with several acquaintances of Blackett have confirmed
he fact -that he and his wife are presently in England.

._I would not be so bold as to maintain that these phone calls
ivyere. in fact. some sort of “intimidation." I have never been inti-
midated as a journalist. so I can not honestly maintain that this is

“ .The receipt, however, of four phone-calls related to either an un-
ublished letter, or an incomplete news article certainly smacks of
J o‘_r‘ne,kind of an attempt to moderate this reporter’s efforts at finding ‘
’-allvthe facts related_to an admittedly controversial topic.

 This form of “intimidation“ has not. for the moment. been suc-
essful: rather. it has heightened my fascination with the story and
“v_d‘etei'mination to present as much of it as possible to the univer-
iteylcornmunity. So my friends withjthe dial-happy fingers. you had

Others were there for a differ-

ed out to me in 'a whisper: "I

_ want to see Mitchell fired.“

' I remember looking. actually
peering through’ the crowd up to
the desk where Senator Sam hir-
vin sat majestically over the
court. He actually resembled the
image on" the lapel buttons worn by
his youthful followers. "Uncle
Sam." the buttons said. encircling
an old and honest face.

"Mr-. Mitchell. do you recall
Mr. Magruder testifying that

. he .had taken these documents‘
and showed them to you?“

Mitchell: “I recall it very viv-
idly because it happens to be a
palpable, damnable lie.”

A palpable. damnable lie‘?‘The
peanut gallery went mad with
hysteria. _ g

I remember the morning turn-
ing to a fervent afternoon for John

After proudly reading a_ dia-

logue from last year between him-

en looked up at the Committee
members as if to say, “What do
you think of that?” Talmadge
replied to Mitchell’_s puppy dog
smile by asking paternally,
“Let’s read a little further, Mr.

rassing silence, Talmadge, read-

e........... ........ .. ........= 

by JOHN METCALFE

Since last Thursday I have been playing a new
game: when I meet people I ask them a simple
question: “What do you think about Nixon going
to the hospital?"

I have asked the question forty or fifty times
since last Thursday. With one exception. the ans-
wers have been full of doubt as to the reality of
the Presidents convenient illness. About twenty
percent of the people I have talked to said some-
thing on the general order of: "I‘ve said for years
that the man was sick. and it’s about time he ad-
mitted it.“ Others remarked on the astonishing
coincidence of the Presidents being struck just
at the moment Senator Ervin had maneuvered him
into a meeting. A minority. but a substantial one.
approximated the following opinion: "I wouldn‘t
believe that man if he claimed to be dead. But
I might consider burying him."

The exception was my landlady, an erect, live-
ly and pleasant lady of eighty. She watches the
Watergate hearings, and does not complain about

the loss of soap opera; she did mention that it is‘

inconvenient to hunt up a different channel every
day. .\ .

She is persuaded that the President is truly
ill. and hopes he will recover soon. She is sym-
pathetic toward him at the moment. Just now he
has a good excuse for not doing what he must
do- where before he had only a shabby series of
increasingly bad excuses for evading his duty.
That duty is. of course. the explanation of the
Watergate. full and complete. Nobody else can do
it for him; far—ranging statements full of weasel-

. words will no’"longer serve; assertions that he need

not answer the question are inadequate: refer-

fences to nonexistent investigations are not enough:
silence and absence from -Washington will not
make the whole thing go away. He has to do it
and time is growing short.

The’ above is a minority opinion — in fact, it is

not even that, but my‘ impression of anopinion. I
have amplified it because it is the only one I en-
countered which could be considered even mildly
favorable to Richard Milhous Nixon.

Others I talked to were not so kind. though
some hesitated to express total distrust of the Pre-
sident. One young woman said: "I don‘t under-
stand it. How could all those doctors be lying‘.""
Another person present rep1ied:"‘How could all
those lawyers be lying?" « ,

I have disliked Richard Nixon consistently.
thoroughly and unfailingly since he first came to
national prominence. I should be pleased that dis-
trust and disbelief have become such a common

- response to him. I am not. He has always been

Richard Nixon. but just now he is also the Presi-
dent. The fact that it is the President of the Unit-
ed States playing roulette to determine which
parts of the Constitution shall be considered op-
erative at any given time casts doubt upon them
office and all who have held it by implication.
Mr. Nixon goes on 'to compound his offenses by
stating that he is/ merely following procedents es-
tablished by- his predecessors.
are. Jefferson and Lincoln are doubtless surprised
by these allegations.

What Nixon probably means is that he has

always been inclined to a light-hearted attitude
toward the laws ‘he is now sworn to faithfully up-

hold. and that nobody» has the right to be surpris-

ed at his subordination of law to convenience.

I have wandered far from the point. My sur-
vey was neither scientific nor' controlled, but I
think itrwas significant. Although the persons.sam-
pled were all known to me, the near unanimity of
their responses is startling. I have rarely been so
thoroughly agreed with. -

, It is sad and shocking that almost no one to-
day seems to be willing to assume that the Presi-
dent of the United States is telling the truth. even

when his health is being discussed. A lot of '

people voted for Mr. Nixon just a few months ago:
some of them -must have been in my sample:
none stepped forward to support the man.

Wherever they ‘

The President’s guilt or innocence is not at
issue here’— that is a matter for the courts, not for
the general public or even the Senate Select Com-
mittee. I am only concerned with trust, and very
few of us resort to the rules of evidence or to the
opinions of twelve of our peers when we choose
to invest our trust in a man or an institution.
The transaction takes place somewhere inside, and
is not accessible to mere logic. It is in that area
that the President has failed at least the forty _or
fifty citizens I talked to.

Simple technical guilt might be easier to take.

Before I came to Pitt I attended another in-
stitution of higher learning. When I left it I
neglected to apply for graduation. They are prob-
ably puzzled by my long absence. but they still
write to me on subjects of student and veteran in-
terest. I recently received such a communication:
in the same mail was a notice from the University
of Pittsburgh. I will share excerpts from both
with you. as they both deal with finances. though
in rather different ways.

The first one begins:

“Dear Veteran

“This letter and the enclosed forms are ex-
tremely important, please read carefully.

“The Veterans Administration has approved a
new program’ under Public Law 92-540 (Advance
Payment) which will benefit you and your house-
hold if you attend college in the fall term . . . . .

“To apply for the advance payment program,
simply complete the enclosed response form, sign,
and return as indicated . . . . . .

“The Veterans Administration will then for-

viard a check made payable to you tomy office. I I

This check will be released only during registra-

‘ tion and upon proof of your registration. A mem-

ber of my staff.‘ . .
check to you.”

This strikes me as a thoughtful and humani-
tarian program. Presumably the VA has neglected
to inform the University of Pittsburgh of its exis-
tence. as Pitt has sent me no such notice. What
I did receive from Pitt was a brochure outlining
a pay-as-you-go financing program. The brochure
bears the University seal on its first page. The
University's name and address are on both the
front and back pages.

The envelope containing the brochure bears the

. will release your unopened

‘ name and seal of the University: curiously. it was

mailed in New Hampshire. An enclosure. under
the University letterhead. reads. in part. as follows:

“It is the policy ofthe University that all stud- .

ents be required to pay in full at the beginning
of each trimester all charges for tuition, fees, room
and boardin order to complete registration.

“Because of the considerable interest . . . .

The University has decided to continue its cur- V

rent arrangement with , a private
organization . . . . Families are free, of course, to
make financing arrangements through other sourc-
es if they prefer. . . . .

“Included with this message,‘ you willnfind a
brochure. . . . .”

It goes on. but that should give the general
tone of the offer. .

Funds are available at an annual interest rate.
of 18’). or 112'} per month. This appears to be the
standard rate for unsecured interstate loans. For
instance. it is identical to the interest charges on
major credit cards. It is two and one half‘ times
the rate charged by PHEAA —'— a rate which does
not take effect until after graduation. It is a pure
and profitable business. The University’s interest
in lending its name to this venture is not clear.

Perhaps the University receives a commission,
or some flat rate of compensation. I do not know
who to ask about this. The message under the
University letterhead was not signed.

Both of the schools which wrote to me that d-ay
are publicly-related institutions. _ “ ‘~

year before. When the thought of

this finally settled into his deep
concentration. causing him to
pause again from testimony. the
photographers went wild to get it
all on film. Meanwhile. the pea-
nut galleryoohed and ahead.

Only when the McGovern loy-
alists ignored the rules of tele-
vision etiquette and hissed John
Mitchell on national television.

did the afternoon have another
break of excitement.

It came because Mitchell told
the Committee what he had cov-
ered up the Watergate affair. “In

my mind, the re-election of Rich-

ard Nixon, compared with what
was available on the other side,
was so much more important,
that I put it in just that context.”

We sat puzzled after the hiss-
ing. I'm sure a question was on
everyone's mind. at least every-
one in the crowded Senate Cau-
caus Room that hot afternoon:

Is the election of a public offi-
cial so vitally important. that it
is ethically right to sacrifice ‘the
liberties granted by the Consti-
tution in order to meet those
ends?

He is very conscious of his role

THOON. Scotland tAPi——Long

- Tom ’Weiskopf. finally harness-

ing a sometimes terrible temper
and exploiting his enormous tal-
ent. won the British Open Golf
Championship Saturday with a
final round 70.

Weiskopf's two-under-par ef-
fort in a soft. summer rain that

bathed the 7.064 yards of gorse g

and heather. thistles and thickets

_ that make up the Old Course at

Troon. gave him a 276 total.

That matched Arnold Palmer‘s
record established when the now
43-year-old Palmer won the 1962
British Open. And the victory.
by three strokes over U.S. Open

>":":champ Johnny Miller and British

veteran Neil Coles. thrust the
tall man from Columbus. Ohio.
into the first rank of the games

‘greats.

Miller, just one stroke back
when the day’s play started, fin-
ished with a 72 and a tie for
second with Coles at 279.

Coles never really- got close
and birdied the final hole for a
66 that would have been a course
record but for the heroics of Jack
Nicklaus.

Just as he did in the final

"round last year. Nicklaus put to-

gether an incredible charge that

’ wasjusta little late.

Herbroke the course record by
two strokes with an amazing, sev-
en-under-par 65 that included an

. eagle three and a 40 foot chip for

a birdie. He was alone in fourth
at 280, eight under par but four
strokes back.

Bert Yancey was next with. a
70-281 as Americans captured
four of the first five places in
this ancient event that began 113
years agoon the links of nearby

Prestwick.

toting Scots around the 18th

Weiskopf. who had led at the
end of every 18-hole stop. was a
front-runner all the way in the
final round. He played in the
last twosome with Miller. the
only man who really had a chance
to overtake him. "stretched his
lead to three strokes at the end of
three holes and led by at least
two the rest of the way.

The 6-foot-3, 30-year-old, now
the winner of four of his last sev-
en starts, collected his first ma-
jor championship—the one he so
desperately wanted.

"I'll -never consider myself a

great player until I win a major

championshipj‘

he said ea_rlier

Always before. his temper had
kept him from achieving ‘ the
greatness most observers thought
was his. _ ‘ .

“Potentially, he’s been an aw-
ful good player for an awful
long time,” Nicklaus said.

\

In the last two months he broke
through. winning the Colonial in
Fort Worth. the Kemper in Char-
lotte and the Philadelphia Class-
ic. He was second in Atlanta.
third in the U.S. Open and fifth
