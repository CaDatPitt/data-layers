  UPMC fights for organ allocations changes

Nic Pedicino

For The Pitt News

A lack of suitable organs did not
kill 18-month-old Jordan Elizabeth
Rosebar last June. E

Jordan was awaiting a liver and
small intestine transplant at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical

' Center when she died. UPMC officials

blame a national organ transplant pol-
icy more concerned with geography
than with treating the sickest people.

If a new federal regulation goes -

into effect, the national organ trans-
plant network will be able to make

assurances of fairness to all transplant
patients and discontinue policy that
UPMC views as dangerous. The regu-
lation would minimize geographic dif-

‘ ferences in waiting times, standardize‘

listingand medical status criteria, and
place greater emphasis on medical
urgency. _ , ‘
Those opposed to government
intervention have already blocked the
U.S. Department _ of Health and
Human Services fromthe scheduled

implementation on Oct. 1.
“Every day the new rule is delayed
. means that more patients will die

,unnecessari1y,’f said John J. Fung,

M.D. Ph.D., chief of transplant

surgery at UPMC.

The
Louisiana.

first battlefield is in

On Oct. 8, UPMC asked the U.S. '

District Court in Baton Rouge, La., to
intervene in a lawsuit the state of
Louisiana and its transplant centers
filed against U.S. Health Secretary
Donna E. Shalala. 4

The issue is the new federal regu-
lation. Louisiana’s interest in this suit
stems from the desire of its transplant
centers and its own organ procurement
organization to preserve the status
quo, inwhich donated organs are allo-

cated to local, regional and national
patients in order of descending impor-
tance, even though there may be a
sicker patient elsewhere. 9

Such a distribution scheme can
result in great geographic disparities
in waiting times, enhancing a patient’s
risk of dying on a waiting list, accord-
ing to a UPMC press release. ‘

The suit also seeks to preserve
Louisiana law requiring donated

- organs to be offered to patients listed
in the state first, promoting the notion

that Louisiana owns the donated

l Off-campus rush events have Pitt
A investigating three fraternities

Senior Staff Writer

Bags of milk cartons for col-

lecting charitable donations and a wall

of mailboxes occupy 603 William Pitt
Union. According to the. 1997-1998
University of Pittsburgh Telephone
Directory, the room is the registered
address for nine Pitt fraternities.

Dennis Donham, assistant vice

chancellor of Student Affairs, said the
Office of Student Affairs is investigat-

_ ing at least three of those Pitt fraterni-

\

ties who mayhave illegal houses out-
side campus boundaries.

On Oct. 1, five fraternities
advertised rush events that were held
off-campus. . .

Delta Sigma Phi and Triangle

, are the only two fraternities allowed to

"reside off-campus and hold rush events

at their houses, according to Joseph
Cavalla, director of Student Activities.
Alpha Epsilon Pi, Phi Sigma
Kappa and Lambda Chi Alpha adver-
tised rush events off-campus, but are
not recognized by the University as
having legal off-campus houses and
therefore are not allowed to hold rush
events -off-campus. Each fratemity’s

registered address is 603 William Pitt

Union. . ,

Having unregistered off-cam-
pus housing would be a violation of a
University policy that states any frater-

nity with a_ WPU address must schedule __

.‘/

\'

all rush activities at that address or at a
commercial establishment.

Donham said his office and the .

Interfratemity Council are reviewing
and monitoring the activities of the
three fraternities.

He noted that within the 48-
hour period following the publishing of
the rush advertisement, numerous peo-
ple within‘ his ofﬁce and those in the
Office of Student Activities were ask-
ingquestions. ' .

_iDonh_am said the fraternities
were possibly being investigated for

other matters. He would not elaborate,

saying the fact that the fraternities may
have "off-campus houses remains the
general "scope of the investigation.

For his own assessment,
Donham said he walked past one par-
ticular house to see if there were any
visible signs, such as a banner, pennant
or_ Greek letters, indicating a fraternity
may be living there. Donham said he
didn’t see anything, but the fraternitiy7s
situation would still be reviewed.

“It will require -a good deal of
cooperation from the fraternities,”
Donham said. -

Eric‘ Frank, president of Alpha

Epsilon Pi, said his fratemity does not
legally have a fraternity house.
“The University does not have

enough houses for everyone,” he said. ,

Frank said 15 of the fraternity

Staff Writer

Your top candidate shows up for
her job interview in a red taffeta dress
and cowboy boots. What do you do?

Emily Toft decided to write a
book, “Ms. A Mentor’s Impeccable
Advice,” which was the topic of a
speech Toft gave for the women’s
studies program,

The Provost’s Advisory
Committee on Women’s Concerns
sponsored the speech .as part of the
committee’s annual reception to honor
new female faculty members, who

-were given candid advice on howto

climb academia’s corporate ladder.

.“Ms. Mentor” — the “academic -

counterpart of Miss Manners” —— was
born in 1982 as a result of what Toft
called the “bitter experience” of hit-
ting the glass’ ceiling fairly early -in her
career. In the 1970s, when Toft was a
graduate studentin the English depart-
ment at Johns Hopkins University ,
she wanted to offer a women’s studies’

course. But he university refused to -

offer academic credit for the class,

claiming “women hadn’t done any-

thing,” she said. .

At that time, Toft said, only 10
percent to 15 percent of female faculty
members gained full professorship, a
percentage she said has not changed in
the past 30 years. According to Toft, a
woman’s charm is more important
than her teaching or research when it
comes to gaining tenure or other pro-
motions. *

During the speech, Toft presented
a humorous look at the world of acad-
emia and discouraged members‘ of the
audience from taking themselves too

seriously. She spoke about how she T

was “surrounded by idiots” during her
time at “a Mid-Atlantic university”_ in
State College, Pa; She also said the
first woman to be offered a position as
aprofessor in Johns Hopkins’ English
department “promptly died.”

To prepare future speech-givers in
the audience,'Toft warned them that
the first person to make a remark about
a speech will invariably be a man, who
will not really ask a question but will
instead attempt to show off his own
personal knowledge —— often about an
unrelated topic. It is an act, she said,
politely referredto as “peacocking.”

“I keep my grandson more than

“Since my son and his girlfriend’s

Grandparents representing all

A 10-year study shows women
should vent their anger instead of
bottling it up inside, to help reduce
their risk of contracting cardiovas-

According to a research study
by Pitt’s School of Medicine, mid-

anger, have hostile attitudes or feel
self-conscious in public are at a

Donham also said at least one
fraternity had violated InterFraternity
Council rush rules and was turned over
to the [PC for review.

“[The University will] give

said.

Donham also said the review
process will be a difficult one.

“Just because «a building is

individuals doesn’t make it a [fratemi—
ty] house,” Donham said. “Certain
information needed for a review is
harder to get at, so the process may take
longer than we thought.

“We want to be clear in our
own consciences that the concerns are
reviewed.” . '

Despite the allegations that
some fraternities’ off—campus addresses
may violate University policy, Donham
said most of the fraternities have. high
standards and stress those qualities
within its members.

“We’d like more [fraternities]
to feel that way,” Donham said. “It
should be a strong selling point to new
members.” V

Pitt plans to remedy the frater-
nity housing problem by adding a new
fraternity complex near Pitt Stadium
within the next three or four years.

“[Having] more on the hill will
add momentum to the ambiance of the
Greek environment,” Donham said.

Part of Donham’s job, as well
as that of the Student Activities Ofﬁce,
is to watch for advertisements and other
information regarding student activi-
ties.

 Donham said he is “at a bit of a
disadvantage. The Greeks know who I
am, so it is not always easy for me to
obtain information.”

He encouraged students who
have information regarding possibly
illegal fraternity houses to contact the
Ofﬁce of Student Affairs.

denied treatment at transplant centers
in his home state, he said he feels
Louisiana’s attempt to stop the HHS
rule would deny him the opportunity to
gain access to donated organs in the
future. -
Judge Ralph Tyson granted

‘Louisiana’s request for a temporary

injunction "to prevent the HHS rule
from going into effect as planned on
Oct. 1. He has scheduled a hearing

today, at which time UPMC is hopeful

it can state its arguments in favor of
the federal regulation.

The HHS had announced the regu-
lation in April, but extensive lobbying
by the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS), which holds the fed-
eral contract to operate the Organ
Procurement and. Transplantation
Network, is fighting HHS’s authority.
UNOS believes it has the right to set

‘its own policy, despite the National

Organ Transplant Act of 1984, estab-
lishing the organization as operating
under the authority of the Secretary of
Health. .

- The rallying cry for the opponents
of Louisiana’s attempt to dismiss the
new regulations could easily be three
words: Jordan Elizabeth Rosebar.

While Jordan was 1-ying in a
Pittsburgh hospital, the organs the
small girl desperately needed were
ready and unavailable in a New
Orleans area hospital.

Louisiana sent the organs to
Atlanta under the current rules that
give regional preference before nation-
al as to who receives the organs. Next,
another apparent miracle was taken
away. A set of organs that could have
helped Jordan appeared in Alabama.

They too were given to someone else.
Finally, hope appeared in western
Pennsylvania, but it was too late. The
sought-after organs were on ice in a
speeding van an hour away when
Jordan died.

UPMC officials say they aren’t
questioning patients’ need of organs
but their level of sickness. Jordan was
listed as a Status 1 patient. Status 1 is
the most serious condition, in which it
is considered the patient will die with-
in seven days without a transplant. The
child in Atlanta was listed as Status 3,
serious but not as critical. The
Alabama hospital refused to release
the level of the patient there.

government’s attempts to restore fair-

centers in Louisiana, are nothing more
than abhorrent,” Fung said. “We have
to look beyond our own self—interests
and embrace what is best for patients
everywhere.”

Fung said he believes the current
policy is perverse, because it does not
serve patients. While they may serve
local transplant centers, they do‘ not
serve all residents of the state. In
Louisiana, for example, more than 30
percent of liver—transplant patients go
out-of-state, some to programs ‘where
access to donated organs is severely
limited. Nationally, 25 percent travel
out of their home states for lifesaving
transplants. ‘

“The new rule will help all
patients, Louisiana patients included,”
Fung said.

Enrro RIAL

Organs should be distributed by
need, not geography

As the situation currently
stands, sick people who desper-
ately need organ transplants are

prioritized not according to how I

desperate their need is but accord-
ing to their geographic location.

As a result of this, 18-month- '

old Jordan Elizabeth Rosebar died
last June at - the University of

Pittsburgh Medical Center while

waiting for a liver and small intes-
tine transplant, which instead
went to _a healthier patient just
because thatpatient happened to
be in the same region as the organ

_donor

This is yet another example of
petty bureaucracy getting in the
way of saving people’s lives.

On Oct. 1, the U.S.
Department’ of Health and Human
Services was set to introduce new
legislation that would require
organs to be distributed on a
patient-need basis. A Status 1
patient —— a person in critical con-
dition who may die within seven
days without a transplant ——
would receive a much-needed
organ before a Status 3 patient.

The state of Louisiana and its
transplant centers, mostly out of
self-interest and cost-cutting, ﬁled
a lawsuit against U.S. Secretary of
Health Donna E. Shalala, prevent-

ing what seems like a common
sense action from being imple-
merited.

Last week, UPMC asked the
U.S. District Court in Baton
Rouge, La. to intervene. UPMC
officials, not questioning a
patient’s needs but using the
patient’s level of sickness as a
determinant of organ distribution,
want to prevent the state of
Louisiana and the United
Network for Organ Sharing from
trying to keep the status quo.

By allowing organs to be dis-
tributed on a basis - of need,
patients will‘ have a greater chance
of receiving organs in time to save
their lives. Though there is a cur-
rent transplant-organ shortage and
some patients wiH still not get the
needed organs on time, the pro-
posed method will at least distrib-
ute available transplant organs in a
more just manner.

If a girl in Pennsylvania with
only one week to live and a girl in
‘Alabama with three months to live
both need a liver, then it would
seem logical to perform the trans-
plant on the Pennsylvanian girl
ﬁrst.

f Transplant organs should not
be bound by geographical bound-

Why terrorism threatens our way of life

V In the last ﬁve years, America has seen the
worst incidence of terrorism in its history. We
have seen‘ a wave of bombings that included an
attempt by Islamic extremists to destroy the
World Trade Center in 1993, an explosion at the
1996 Olympic Games, and the recent bombings
of two U.S Embassies by Islamic extremists.

There have also been several standotfs
between federal agents and disgruntled
Americans driven by hatred of their government
to take up arms. What is particularly wonisome
is that the worst may be yet to come.

The emerging information age provides
America with the possibility of tremendous eco-
nomic growth and prosperity, but it also leaves
us precariously vulnerable. To ﬁnd information
on how to manufacture bombs and weapons,
one needs only to go onto the Internet and down-

“It’s buried in all parts of the budget. Every
agency’s got a part of it, and nobody is really in
charge,” said Nunn. The federal government is

so unprepared to deal with terrorism that the"

spokesman of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).adrnitted that if
another Oklahoma City-type incident takes place
in the future, “we are probably going to hear
about it on CNN.” V

The United States needs to. launch a con-
certed, long-term, effort to combat terrorism

there is a major terrorist incident, American

Imagine someone slipping a computer bug

Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick
commented in an interview, “We will have the
cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor at some point,
and we don’t want to wait for this to happen”
Our vulnerability to cyberattack may pose an
even greater threat to America than. the much-
discussed year 2000 computer bug.

As alarming as the availability of informa-

tion and the proliferation of the ways to commit
crimes are, what is perhaps even more disturbing

pretend that this problem will go
away. The head of the FBI’s terrorism division,
when asked about the possibility of anattack on
American citizens by chemical or biological
weapons, said, “The consensus of people in law
enforcement is that it’s not a matter of if it’s
going to happen, it’s when.”

There is opposition, some justiﬁed and

some not, that increased anti-terrorism measures ‘

will lead to restrictions in American civil liber-
ties. The_National Riﬂe Association, for exam-
ple, has spent 16 years opposing such anti—ter-

rorism measures as taggants, microscopic plastic’

chips that can be added to explosive materials so

law enforcement ofﬁcers can track down the per- '

petrators of a bombing. Personally, I fail to
understand the NRA’s bizame logic. Why on
earth would anyone want to defend criminals
and terrorists bent on killing innocent people?
To protect our safety, we must take certain
precautions in the future. Building anti-terrorist
protocols into our computer systems is a good
place to start, as would be having the govern-
ment more deﬁne how anti-terrorism funds are

All hail the Homecoming King and Queen!

Rehan 'Nasir

_ Columnist

Congratulations! You have been cho-
sen as either Homecoming King or Queen
(see below). In the past, your duties have
included the obligatory lap around the sta-
dium and a lot of smiling and waving.
However, this year we’ve decided it’s
time to treat you like the potential market-
ing tool you are and exploit you for the
beneﬁt of the University, so we ask that
you ﬁllout the following questionnaire —
it will help us help you to help us exploit
you!

Page 1: Please ﬁll out your name, and cir-
cle whether you have been selected as
Homecoming King or Homecoming
Queen. If you are not sure or are uncer-
tain, please ﬁnd out as soon as possible
and let us know.

Page 2: Please draw a happy tree, and
label its parts. We recommend drawing a
fall or winter tree instead of a spring or
summer tree. This will save you time —
especially since you don’t have to draw all
of those pesky leaves. Please remember
that coniferous trees «do not lose their
leaves during the winter unlessithey are
dead. '

Page 3: Answer the following math ques-
tion to the best of your ability (drawing
small diagrams with labels is sometimes
useful). However, since partialcredit can-
not be awarded, knowing the answer
beforehand/cheating/guessing will actual-
ly work to your advantage. ‘

Problem: You have just taken a difficult

test and done miserably. Wanting to take
your aggression out on something nearby,
you decide that throwing a computer out a
window is your best bet. So you grab a
computer weighing 15 pounds and head
up to the 35th ﬂoor of the Cathedral.
Using a catapult you launch the computer

degrees into the heart of campus. If the

Rehan Nasir was never chosen as Snow

Comm

Pittsburgh could
learn a thing or .
two from

Cleveland.

Sit back, close your eyes, and
envision it with me.

The city of Pittsburgh would be
celebrating its baseball team’s play-
off run. The Steelers would be unde-
feated, and Ron Francis would still

be in Penguins’ black and gold..

Mario Lemieuxwould not be bitch-
ing about the “small” amount of
money he is owed. '

All three professional teams in
this city would be‘ playing in either

new or remodeled stadiums and are-‘

nas.
The city of Pittsburgh would be
reaping the benefits of new job
opportunities created by all these
wonderful additions;

OK, you can open your eyes now
and come back to reality. When you
were doing this stupid imagination
practice, did you come close to see-
ing Cleveland or make visual com-
parisons?

Pittsburghers are supposed to
hate Cleveland. This has more to do
with the Steelers-Browns rivalry than
anything else. I was one of these

brainwashed children growing up

here. ‘

My first visit to Clevelandnine
years ago proved that the things my
parents and grandparents were telling
me were true. The city reminded me
of a dump. The streets were littered,
and the people were unkind. I’m
thinking that had something to do
with 15 of my family members being
decked out in Steelers paraphernalia.

In early September, I visited
Cleveland again for an Indians base-
ball game. Never mind that it was
against the Chicago White Sox and
Albert Belle. ~

' Jacobs Field was as beautiful and

’majestic as I had heardon television
and radio. Its neighbor, Gund Arena, ’

the recently built basketball arena for
the Cavaliers, was_ just as eye-catch-
mg.

Even more impressive was the
construction of the football stadium
to house the NFL’s Browns next sea-
son. Everywhere I looked, my jaw
dropped, and my visions of
Cleveland were rapidly changing.

New options in Panthers offense

Kevin Lilley

Senior Football Writer

Brandon Williams wasn’t recruited
for this. - .

For two. years at Valley High
School in the Pittsburgh suburbs,
Williams ran an offense based on the
option — a play designed for teams
with speed at running back and at
quarterback but without a strong pass-
ing attack." '

The option worked at Valley, with
Williams averaging more than a first
down a carry (10.2 yards) for his
career.

He came to Pitt expecting to play a
part in the pass—oriented West Coast
Offense,’ but now, the option is back.

, “I’ve been running it for two years
[in high school] and through camp, so
I’m pretty comfortable with it,”
explained the freshman.

From the looks of things, so isthe
Panther offense. What started out as a

diversion in the early going — some— V

thing to keep defensesguessing and
establish the running game —-— has
become “a whole other package,”
according to Pitt quarterback Matt

Lytle. ‘ I

1 At Tuesday’s practice, Lytle an
teammates worked on new variants to
the Panther option, including options
with an option to pass, options with an
option to reverse, and options with,
well 

“We have a lot of options from the
option,” Lytle said.

One of the new wrinkles has the
senior quarterback rolling out, running
back in tow and ﬁring down the field
to Latef Grim or Terry Murphy. The
receivers normally face double cover-
age, but draw half that when a defen-
sive back is forced to stay near the line
in case Lytle pitches. ,

If the receiver can’t break free or
the running back draws the eyes of the
opposition, the quarterback can always
keep the ball and run it_ himself..

Lytle has done just that this sea-
son, rushing 56 "times. Williams leads
the team with 57 carries and has out-
gained Lytle in yardage, 203 to miifus
two.

Of course, sacks count against the
quarterback’s rushing numbers.
Discounting the yards Lytle lost on
plays that haVen’t involved an "option

Fortunately, for those students or ‘
alumni in the Pittsburgh area who can

not attend Saturday’s game, the kick-off
time has been changed to noon to
accommodate television coverage of
the Big East Game of the Week.- 9
According to E.J. Borgetti, the
Panthers director of media relations, the

game will be shown, regionally on chan- .

nel four. The television coverage means
the normal Panther Prowl, the parade of
players from Sutherland Hall to Pitt
Stadium, and the Fan Fest, which nor-
mally start at 1 p.m., will now begin at
10 a.m.

Nittany Lions beat Panthers on the ice

Marianne E. Graham

For the Pltt News

Tony Hermakevich and David
Fryer scored the only two Pitt goals
in the ice—hockey team’s opening
game, an 11-2 loss to Penn State.

Penn State’s Ryan Touchton had
four goals, and Dan Horowitz had a
hat trick in the Nittany Lions’ win
over the Panthers.

PSU opened the ﬂoodgates five
minutes into the game with
Touchton’s first goal and scored six
unanswered goals through the mid-
way point of the second period.

Hermakevich got Pitt on the

'power—p1ay goal

board when he scored on a power
play with 28 seconds leftin the sec-
ond period to make the score 6-1
heading into the third period.

The goal was the Panthers’ only
in the game,
despite ll opportunities with a man
advantage.

After allowing three more goals,
including Touchton’s fourth and
Horowitz’s third, the Panthers final-
ly scored again with Davi.d Fryer’s
goal that made the score 9-2.

Goaltender Patrick Kenny was
pulled after letting in a 10th goal at
9:48 of the third period. Dave
Ciarletta took Kenny’s place, and

allowed only one goal in his 10
minutes of play.
The game was the first this sea-

son for the Panther ice—hockey

team, and despite the lopsided
score, it gave the coaching staff
great hope for the rest of the season.

“We’re about 10 steps ahead of
where we were last year,” said
coach Wade Chouinard. '

With the addition of some large
freshmen, including Justin Grass,

-Ross Stuart and Stan Garb, the

Panthers‘ feel that with time, they

will have some offensive punch.
Another bright spot for the

Panthers was the play of Mike Roth,

es and 145 pounds, caused frustra-
tion for the Nittany Lions, who
seemed to think that they would be
able to dominate him because of his
size. His name did not appear on the
score sheet,‘ but it is certainly
ingrained in the minds of Penn State
players. ~

Despite the score, Chouinard
remarked that there were many pos-
itives in the game and that the
teams actuallymatched up well.

Chouinard pointed out that Penn
State practices four to five times a-
week, while Pitt, which does not
have its own rink, gets practices
less than half as often.

But the coach .didn’t offer
excuses. , .

“From our perspective, it’ was

State’s teani"didn’t have a better

system than we did. Some’ of our

guys were not prepared mentally.”

Wine bottles fill the rocks at the Aood Street State Lquor Sr in akland.

 

Rebecca Riddle
Managing Editor

Everything is planned for a perfect
romantic dinner.

Two candles illuminate the table
lined with a crisp white cloth. The best
dishes have been polished, and the
first three courses are simmering on
the stove.

Only one thing is missing: a good
bottle of wine.

But upon entering the liquor store,
confusion sets in. _Rows of red, white
and bluish—grape alcohol peer from
shelves. Prices range from $6 to $200,
and the store attendant knows more
about the new shipment of vodka than
which wine to choose.

At a restaurant, a good waiter or
waitress can settle the choice. But
when transforming your kitchen into a
glamorous night out, that convenience
isn’t available.

This is a scenario in which basic
knowledge of wine can be beneficial.

According to Matthew Kerr, of the
Bradley House of Catering, Inc. in
Pittsburgh, wine is essential to com-
plete a great meal, and choice of wine
can either make or break a well-pre-
pared dinner.

_“Different wines have different
levels of ﬂavor,” said Kerr.

The level of ﬂavor, or body, of

»L;\l \A’S
”v\°.,.tie

Qestaurawt

wines is determined by the “tanon”’——
the amount of skin, seeds and stems
that was in the barrels with the grapes
during the aging process. A dry wine
has a higher tanon, while a sweeter
wine has a lower tanon.

Wines need to in be carefully
matched to foods in order to bring out
the greatest level of ﬂavor in both the
wine and the meal.

When choosing a light—ﬂavored
poultry for amain course, wine choice
should also be light. A white wine,
such as a Chardonnay, goes best with
poultry prepared in light sauces, such
as stir-fry or cream sauce. ’

Heavily ﬂavored poultry, such as a
teriaki, however, is best complimented
by a red wine. Kerr recommends a
Chablis for heavie'r—tasting poultry.

If a game bird, such as duck or
grouse, is the main course for the
meal, a full-bodied red wine, such as a»
cabemet soveignion, would be the best
choice “because it has such a heavy
ﬂavor,” said Kerr.

Kianti, a popular Italian red wine,

goes best with both red meat and

pasta, he said.

Because they are more fortified
than other wines, making them sweet-
er, sherry and port wines go best with
any kind of dessert.

Kerr recommends changing wines

Party! __

Yes, it seems that the colder and
darker it gets, people_ find more and
more excuses to party. Homecoming.
Halloween. Thanksgiving. And, even-
tually, Christmas and New Year’s.
Chances are, you’ll be invited to a
party or two for many of these events
as they pass by on the calendar. But if
you see a slow weekend or feel a bit

ambitious, why count on others’ gen-

erosity? You may instead feel com-
pelled to throw a party of your own.
The trick to throwing a really
good party is to realize your role as
the host. For those lucky few among
you with bulging wallets, many
restaurants will be more than happy to
cater your special event. But part of
the whole essence of the college expe-
rience is doing things by the seat of

a few tips from the pros to keep in

Appearance is almost everything.
You can’t make lousy food taste good
by making it appear attractive, but
you can jazz up those middle—of—the—
road dishes. ‘
“Presentation is the key,” said
Traci Vogel, a Pitt junior who works
part time with a caterer in the North
Hills. “One simple trick is to arrange
food into shapes. A few weeks ago,
we took a smoked salmon and cut it
into small, fish—shaped slices.”
However, you don’t even need
this level of dexterity to intrigue your
"guests. Try peeling the tails off shrimp
and arranging the shrimp in a curved
shape. Then take a few of the tails,
and arrange them at the end of the
curve to make a real jumbo shrimp. .

-Cook‘ some refried beans with some

cheddar cheese, salsa and frozen
sweet corn for an unusual but tasty
dip. Shy away from weird combina-
tions. That peanut butter and pickle
sandwich you used as a gross-out in
elementary school may not be such a
good idea now. (Maybe at 3 a.m.,
things will be different.) Try sticking
with the basics. '

“One of our most popular" desserts
is our ‘Viennese’ brownie,” -said
Vogel. “It’s a two— layer brownie with
some cheesecake in the middle and
cream cheese on top.”

Simple Is Good. Some of you may
not have access to -a kitchen, as there
are few in the residence halls, or you
may just feel intimidated by any form
of cookingbeyond pasta or fried eggs.
Never fear — even the most basic of
ingredients present tons of options.
“There’s a lot you can do besides
the traditional cheese or veggie tray,”
said Vogel, who added that her cater-
er’s clients are delighted by simple
dishes that use a “secret” blend of
spices to give meals a unique taste.
Try slicing up red, ripe tomatoes

cost you all of $5 and take 10 minutes
to make. And don’t forget the bever-

ages! “Hairy buffalo” punch, which

consists of equal parts ginger ale, 7Up
andiHawaiian Punch from a can with
chopped fruit, is always a conversa-
tion-starter. If you’re still out of ideas,
there’s the World Wide Web, which
has an amazing array. of easy recipes

-and ideas, as well as the zillion or so

cookbooks at the local bookstore.

Keep things in perspective. Maybe
your friends aren’t so easily
impressed with your elaborate spread.

“Having catered-type foods is not
a traditional thing at college parties,”
warned Vogel. P

They may care more about the"

deep philosophical questions of the
day than oohing and aahing over the
pagoda you made out of carrot sticks.
If this is the case, you can stick to
chips, salsa and the occasional frank-
furter. But if you ever reach the point
where you get bored with that, spend-
ing a little extra time in your local
supermarket and exercising your cre-
ative mind at home will help make
this party season better than ever
before.

Neverunclerestimate the power of pasta

AJ Rodgers
Staff Writer

Discovering a burst of
unknown courage, you finally
ask the woman or man of your
dreams to dinner and a movie.
The person accepts.

Now where do you go to
eat? I _ ,

The average college stu-
dent will agree that the best
first date ‘is an inexpensive
casual restaurant. No pressure
is involved in how to look, at
least in this stage of the game.
Most likely, the menu will
have food both people _can

enjoy. And afterward, there is I

enough money for fun times
at the movies.

However, variety is the
spice of life, and for those
who like spice, Indian food
may be just thething.

“For a first date, Indian is
great,” said Lisa Infield, a Pitt
student. “I like to see just how
much heat my date can han-
dle.”

A topic open to debateis
the question of buffets on the
first date. 5 5

Pitt student Charles
McKinley said, “The food’s

low—quality, and you pay too
much for it.”

But Dawud Akbar, anoth-
er student, feels that buffets
are good because “maybe the
girl really likes to eat.”

Pitt student v Melissa
Devinney worried about the
buffet because “you don’t
want to get up all the time.
There’s no time to get to know

V the person.”

Vic Adebakin, on‘ the
other hand, believes you get
to “see how healthy her eating
habit is.”

One date can -lead to
another and another, and soon
the one—month anniversary
appears. Both people know
each other fairly well and are
better equipped to undertake
dinner. . —

A home—cooked meal may
add the enchantment a restau-
rant can’t give. Greatchoices
here are Italian or Mexican.
Those intimate Italians or
Latin lovers are stereotyped

better than, let’s say, those,

romantic Russians. Maybe it’s
because people prefer a well-
layered lasagna over a steam-

ing cup of bolshoi. Or maybe .

because it’s just easier to

make. _

“Definitely Italian,” said
Tracy Maler, a Pitt student.
“lt’s all I know how to cook,
and it’s more romantic.”

Most students agree that
simple is the way to go when
cooking meals at home.

Months pass quickly, and

just around the comer is the  V
all-too—important one—year c 

anniversary. It can be as
nerve—racking as the first date,
which Jen Judeikas and her
boyfriend chose to re—enact..
“We did everything that
we did that night and remem-
bered things,”— said Judeikas.
7‘We even got drunk on the
exact same beer.”
Nicole Peditto
remembers her one-
year anniversary dinner.
“I ate Thanksgiving
dinner with my parents,
and he ate with his,” she

said. “We got together after— :

wards.”
However, Peditto does-

n’t recommend anniversary
celebrations like hers, con-
sidering she’s no longer
going outwith the guy.

“The most expensive A"

dates should be saved for

a year anniversary,” said Pete went smoothly, nothing was

Goughnour. “Get dressed up,

go to an exquisite restaurant,

and make it work out right.”
So things turned out

pretty well. Dinner ,.

turned out to be enlightening.

It should never be shaken or moved
quickly, and the bottle should always
be laid on its side. » .

In order to enjoy the full aroma, or
“bouquet,” of wine, the beverage
should be served in a glass_suitable for
its kind. Red wines are served in larg-
er, fuller glasses, while white wine is
complimented best by a taller, skinnier
glass and dessert wines should be
served in a sherry—type glass.

Next to a large meal, a glass of
wine is often overlooked, but whether
it sits next to a plate of spaghetti or a
seven-course meal, wine is actuallyan
important part of fine dining,. adding

Kerr.

Most of the more expensive_wines
are imported from Europe. This is
where the price comes in. Where many
American wines are made to consume,
many wines in Europe are made
according to tradition. ,

Because of strict laws dictating
how wines must be made in Europe in
order to retain the classic style, many
imported wines are expensive.

“‘We [Americans] make wine just
to make wine,” said Kerr. “Over there,

throughout the courses of each meal to
compliment each course. He also
warns never to drink wine with salads

“The acidity of the dressing clash-
es with wine,” said Kerr.

When it comes time to buy wine,
often the difference in price for similar
wines is large. The price of a particu-
lar kind of wine can range anywhere
from single dollars to hundreds of dol-
lars.

But, according to Kerr, a good-
tasting bottle of wine can cost as little
as $10. From there, prices for wine it’s something special.”

that surprised me. The Rock ‘n Roll
Hall of Fame is also located in
Cleveland. The changes weren’t just
on the outside, either.

Inside Jacobs Field that warm
September evening, I saw the reasons

FROM PAGE 9

..I fell in love with baseball when I

was young. The stadium was packed
to capacity, and almost everyone
there was actively participating in
cheers and jeers.

A 4-year-old girl was screaming
“Joey” at the top of her lungs when
Belle came to bat. For those of you
who don’t know, Belle’s name when
he broke into the majors with
Cleveland was Joey.

Red, white and blue were the only

colors I ‘could makeiout looking out .

at the rest of those who had attended.

College—age women were decked
out in Jim Thome, Omar Vizquel and
David Justice jerseys. This was espe-

. cially exciting because the last time I

saw a woman wearing a Pirates jersey
in Pittsburgh, some guy named Bonds
was on the back of it.

It was about the fourth inning
when I became an Indians fan and
was completely overwhelmed by
what I was witnessing. _

Near the end of a very exciting
game, I was part of the crowd, show-
ing my support for the home team.
The Indians eventually lost the game,
and 1’ was a little upset. _

I am not praising the city of
Cleveland, nor am I disowning my
own hometown of Pittsburgh. I am
simply saying that Cleveland did
what it had to do and is now enjoying
a rebirth. '

Pittsburgh is on the verge of
doing the same.‘

‘Of course, there is the question of
history and tradition.

My only reply is to ask one
another question. Do you think the
fans of the Cleveland Indians are
complaining now about Cleveland
Municipal Stadium being torn down?

Next year, will the ‘5Dawg
Pound” be so upset about having to
play in a new facility? Probably not. ‘I
suppose they are happy knowing they
will have a team next year to cheer
for.

OK, time for. another ' exercise.
You're probably saying, “Shut up,
ass, you've done enough to break, the

hearts of Pittsburghers everywhere.”' ’

But my intentions are good. , .

It’s technically not a home
meet, but for the Pitt men’s and
women’s cross-country teams, the
Duquesne Invitational is as close as
it gets. The Panthers will compete
in the invitational meet at Schenley
Park on Saturday morning.

The women’s race begins at 10,
and the men start at 10:45. Both
races start and finish on the
Schenley Park track.

It is not a particularly specta-
tor-friendly course, but according
to Pitt head coach Dave Sobal, “you
can see the runners for quite a while
as they come into the finish.”

The race will be largely a show-
down between the major Pittsburgh
schools — Pitt, Carnegie Mellon

and Duquesne. Robert Morris is
expected to compete, and Kent
State University may also partici-
pate.

Even though it’s a relatively
small meet, Pitt is taking it serious-
ly. . .

“We want to run a good, tough
race at home,” Sobal said.

In fact, the men sat out last
weekend’s meet at St. Francis in
part to rest for this “home” meet.
This is also Pitt’s last tuneup race
before the Big East Championship
meet.

The meet should be fairly com-
petitive, as well.

“Carnegie Mellon will be
tough,” Sobal said. “Their women
are ranked fifth nationally in
Division III. It should be a great
racef’

For the Pltt News

The Pitt rugby team lost to West
Virginia 24-10 Saturday.

The loss was actually an
improvement for the Panthers.
When Pitt and WVU played in
September,‘ the Mountaineers
slaughtered Pitt 55-10.

Pitt head coach Dave Talbert
credits West Virginia’s experience
for its two wins this season. Pitt has

a young team, but the rookies are’

learning the gamequickly, he said.
Another factor is that WVU has
several players hailing from
England, Where manypeople begin
playing rugby at an early age.
Talbert was impressed with his
team’s improvement and said he

‘ knows that there is more to come.

“The team seems to have found
its heart,” Talbert said. “We’ve got-
ten more aggressive, which was
lacking in the last game. They
played their asses off out there.”

There were several fights

between the two teams. Players
began bickering over rules and
calls, and eventually tempers
ﬂared. -
Another problem with the game
was that the league referee never
showed up. After waiting well past
the scheduled game time, West
Virginia’s coach offered to offici-
ate, even though he is not certified
to referee. ’ b
Although Talbert felt the coach
was fair in calls, the fact that the

opposing team’s coach acted as the -

referee raised the issue of objective
officiating.

Tim Walker, one of‘ Pitt’s cap-
tains, said this game was definitely
more intense than the last. He was
especially impressed with Alan
Bunpeman, who scored twice for
Pitt.

Several rookies started in the
game, giving them an opportunity

to gain valuable experience. , _
That_ experience is vital, as

Talbert is viewing this season‘ as a
building season. '

“I don’t always like keeping the
ball, but  you do what you can,”
Lytle said.

Williams complimented the quar-
terback on his running ability in a
roundabout fashion, saying, “I didn’t
think he could run as fast as he was.”

While the option frees Lytle from
the bounds of the pocket, it also frees
undersized Panther lineman from
head—on collisions with defenders such
as 255-pound Rutgers nose guard
Ansel George-Shields. _

back swing out to the sidelines, the
linemen swing right along with them.

become prime targets for chop—block-.
1ng.
“It’s a different wrinkle in our
blocking scheme,” Williams said. “It
gives the fullback and the linemen a
new look.”

It also slows down the defensive
rush considerably and can be so dam-
aging to the knees and shins of oncom-
ing opponents that the move is illegal
in high school football outside the inte-
rior line. Williams’ blockers at Valley
had to move their men the old-fash-
ioned way, and the running back says
that the ability for linemen to chop-
block in the open field makes the play
even more dangerous.

remainder of practice.

- If the depth chart gets too thin (and a
few NCAA regulations get ignored
completely), the Panthers do appear to
have a new option at backup quarter-
back — Pete Gonzalez. -.

The Steeler backup returned to his
old home yesterday, throwing a few
passes on the Pitt Stadium turf and
chatting with players and coaches.

Gonzalez keeps in contact with the
team through weekly ‘phone calls,
according to Pitt head coach Walt
Harris. Gonzalez joins Billy West,
Frank Moore and other graduates on
the list of those returning to help the
program. .

“I hope all our ex—football players
feel that way,” Harris said.

The quarterback couldn’t escape
some ribbing from the coach, however.
Harris added that his new [nickname
for his former quarterback is “Slash,”
which‘ Gonzalez has earned from
receiving Kordell Stewart’s warm-up
passes on the sideline. I

Assistant Sports Editor

Remember Tony Zimmerman?

The prized recruit of 1996 from
nearby Penn-Trafford High School
was supposed to continue his brilliant
quarterbacking career by playing col-

lege football right here in Pittsburgh. ’

’ Three years later, that is exactly
what Zimmerman is doing. However,
he’s now playing for Duquesne
instead of Pitt, where he originally
planned to play.

Zimmerman was the Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic League’s
leading passer as a senior and was

— recruited by several of the nation’s top

schools. When he chose Pitt, it
became a foregone conclusion that he
was the Panthers’ quarterback of th
future. _ ' 6

But Zimmerman never realized
his potential at Pitt and toiled deep in
the Panther depth chart for two years.
By last spring’s Blue-Gold game, it
was obvious that he was still strug-
gling to grasp Walt Harris’ West Coast
offense.

Before the start of this season,
Zimmerman announced that he was
transferring all the way down Forbes
Avenue to play for Division I—AA

nonscholarship Duquesne.
Since he was going down a level

in his transfer, he did not lose a year
of eligibility as he would have if he’d
gone to another Division I-A school.

“He seems to have adjusted well,”
said Duquesne head coach Greg
Gattuso." “He isn’t looking around,
wondering why we don’t ﬂy to all our
away games or anything like that.

“He’s a kid that just wants to play
football, and he is doing a good job
for us,” Gattuso added.

So far this season, Zimmerman
has completed 65 of 144 passes for
1107 yards through six games. He has
also thrown for 12 touchdowns and 10
interceptions, which gives him a quar-
terback rating of 123.33.

The Dukes are 4-2 overall and 3-1

"in the Metro Atlantic Athletic

Conference.

Zimmerman inherited the daunt-
ing task of replacing Dave Loya, the
Dukes’ all—time leading "passer who
graduated last year. _

In high school Zimmerman, led
the WPIAL in passing with 2,618
