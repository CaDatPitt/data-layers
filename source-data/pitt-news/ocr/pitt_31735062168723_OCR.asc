Hit Century Mark

Frosh Overwhelm St. Vincent

Any time a basketball
coach has a 21 point half-
time lead, you would think
he would be satisﬁed. Frosh coach
Tim Grgurich had that lead Mon-
day night against St. Vincent,
but he was unhappy with his
team’s play.

For, although they scored 49
points, the freshman cagers made
too many mistakes to suit Grgur-
ich. There were a dozen or so
turnovers, and what Grgurich
called “some very sloppy de-
tense.”

The frosh made fewer mis-

takes and scored more points in
the second half, as they defeat-
ed St. Vincent, 103-57. “We play-
ed altogether different on de-
fense in the second half,’’ said
Grgurich. “We made a couple of
adjustments and they worked.
We held them to eight points the
ﬁrst 11 minutes.”

While the defense was holding,
the offense was scoring at a high
rate. Seven of the frosh ﬁnished
in double ﬁgures, led by Bob Pe-
trini who had 20, with 17 of
those coming in the ﬁrst half.

At the start of the game, Pe-
trini bucketed the ﬁrst basket,

Swim Team Opens Season

With Away Meet Saturday

by JAY KAPLAN

It looks like the swimming
team, even though it must make
the transition to its new coach,
Jerry Snyder, and survive the
loss of last year’s top diver, Don
Hahnfeldt, will improve upon
last years 4-7 record. ‘

The graduation of Hahnfeldt is
a serious setback. Last year Hahn-
feldt placed second in the East-
erns in both the one and three
meter diving events. However,
Snyder says that in junior divers
Rodney Chambers and Dean Cole-
man the team will be strong in
the diving events.

The three big returnees from
last year’s team are juniors John
Lane and Joe Le Viere, and sen-
ior Gary Martin. Last year Lane
had a combined total of 15 wins
and two seconds in the 200 and
500 yard freestyles, and Le Viere
had seven ﬁrsts and two seconds
in the backstroke. This year Mar-
tin is capable of swimming in all
events_

The two strongest swimmers up
from last year’s freshman team
are the Norris twins. Howard
swims the butterﬂy and the dis-
tance freestyle while. Rich is in
the individual freestyle medley.

making eight shots in a row be-
fore he missed. When he left, the
slack was taken up by Bob Mc-
Farland who ended with 14
points.

Mike Patcher, who saw little
ﬁrst half action because of foul
trouble, also had 14, all in the
second half. Paul Naponick had
13 points. Naponick, who recent-
ly came out for the team “is just
starting to come along,” said
Grgurich.

Starting guard Dick Hassinger
and reserve guard Bob Brickn-er
each tallied 10 points, while cen-
ter Charlie Hunt had ll. Grgur-
ich still expects more scoring
from Hunt. “One of these days
he's going to ﬁnd himself, and
then it’ll be all over.” ’

sity at the Field House.

minutes left in the game. The
team had shot a ﬁne 60 per cent
in the first half and Kalata kept
the hot pace with two consecu-
tive three-point plays at the start
of the second half. ‘

Then the Colonials’ new head
coach Warren Mitchell called a
t-ime out and reorganized his
strategy. He ordered his team
into a half-court press and sud-
denly the turnovers and sloppy
play his team had displayed be-
came the cagers’ trademark in-
stead.

In seven mintes, William &
Mary outscored the Panthers 18-2
and tied the game at 47 all. Soon
after, they took the lead at 54-52
and kept‘ it the rest of the Way.

“We deserved to_lose,” said a
visibly upset coach Bob Timmons.
“They gave us the open man
e-very\time on their press but we
never seemed to get the ball to
him. And when we shot in the
second half, we were cold. They
practically da_red us to shoot,
knowing they’d get the rebound.”

On defense, the Panthers could-
n"t stop the Colonials’ center
Dave Daugherty. ,Virtua.lly aone-

man show, Daugherty banked in
14 points in the second half, 22
for the game.

“We couldn’t get them to pres-
sure William & Mary on de-
fense,” Timmons pointed out.
“They lost their poise at both
ends of the court.”

It got to the point that with
2:31 left on the clock and the
score 63-65, Timmons sent spare
forward Bill Buck into the game

to replace Ken Bollens who had .

iouled out. .

“Buck is more aggressive on
defense than Al DeFrischia,’_’
noted Timmons, “and that’s why
I had to send him in. When
you’re behind, you have to play
aggressive.”

DeLisio, who played his best
game yet with 14 points, also
fouled out. Timmons was. forced
to replace him with Mel Cratsley
because Pete Smith was hamp-
ered by an eye injury. The bench

that"Timmons had hoped to rely _

on wasn’t there.

Kalata, improving with every
game, led all scorers with 23
points, but it wasn’t enough to
stop the Colonials.

 

SOPHOMORE LEN KALATA played his- best game Monday night

against Vvilliam & Mary in a losing effort. He hit on eight of 12 from

the ﬂoor in scoring 23 points. Kalata appears to have won the start-
ing forward spots opposite Ken Bollens.

Matmen Host Frankies

At Fieldhouse Saturday

by ROY JACOBS

Although a week overdue, the wrestling squad swings
into action against St. Francis this Saturday at Fitzgerald
Field House, starting at 2:00 p.m.

Last Saturday the matmen were scheduled for a quad-
rangular meet at Ohio State with Virginia Tech and Eastern
Michigan, but an administrational mixup in an exchange of
letters caused a cancellation. St. Francis represents the only
meet competition for the wrestlers until next term.

“I don’t know much about theirteam,” said second-year
coach Dave Johnson. “They have one state champion, but I
don’t know about the rest.” The

team should report to Dr. George

Frankies defeated Slippery Rocli,
24-8, last Saturday.

Johnson was more speciﬁc about
his own team but wasn’t that
optimistic. . _

"Business lacks  
script material.  
  lacks action?

(I Businesslacks glamour, and this sad
fact has helped divert young
people away from business careers.”

Dear Mr. Byman:

You characterize yourself as belonging to ”the
first generation of television addict children.”

~ As such, you have been schooled by the suspense-

ful, action-packed worlds of cowboys, detectives,
physicians, lawyers, and journalists—business and
businessmen weren't in the picture. Why? Because

A you say business lacks glamour.

|t’s.quite possible that you and I differ in our
definition of ”glamour” and ”action.”

Frankly, I'm quite sure many doctors and attorneys
just smile at the television world of Dr. Kildare

i_ and Perry Mason.

But semantics aside, I think that business offers
plenty of opportunity for activities that are not

A only colorful and exciting—but also highly mean-
ingful and challenging. Consider some examples.

"Motorola has men who live and breathe every

Gemini test flight. We've assigned men to work
closely with the Chicago and Los Angeles Police '

j., Departments in order to design communications
7 systems of maximum efficiency. Employees of

r 1', Litton-Industries are directing the work of Job

;:Corps Camps. International Minerals has men

, ISSUES AND ANSWERS A

—Bob Byman, University of Illinois

THE ISSUE:

America and the deserts of the Near East. There's
script material in these situations and in the
many others like them.

That's one kindiof a_ction—direct and personal.
Action on the firing line.

But, there's another kind of action——less exciting,
perhaps, but equally or more rewarding. It's
similar to what goes on behind the lines, in the
command post. It involves decision-making,
problem analysis, working with people. It's the
kind of action that most businessmen face
every clay.

And, in business, what a mandoes and how he
does it can affect hundreds, thousands, and even
millions of people. It's quite a responsibility.

Look at it this way. At Motorola, I share with
department managers the responsibility of
providing jobs for over 30,000 employees; of
seeing to it that their working conditions are
dignified, rewarding, and challenging. I also share
a responsibility to the millions ofpeople who.--
buy, use, or are affected by our products. A
responsibility to provide value and quality.

To see to it, for example, that our hospital
products are just what the doctor_ ordered, that '
they make a direct contribution to efficient
hospital operations and personalized patient care.

For the last seven weeks, this paper has been publishing a unique_ exchangeof
views—a dialogue between Robert W. Galvin, Motorola Chairman, and Bob Byman,

 University of Illinois student.

At Mr. Galvin’s invitation, Mr. Byman presented some ofthe opinions—positive and A
negative—that students have" about business. This is Mr. Galvin’s answer to one of the issues

are points to discuss.

A. ' raised. Responses to additional issues will appear in this paper and, shortly, Mr. Byman
.. I will comment on what Mr. Galvin has to say. The dialogue willcontinue as long as there

This and similar dialogues are appearing in college newspapers throughout the country.

 

  
 

These responsibilities and others start with
management, but they involve and depend on
every man and woman in the company.

Most companies and most businessmen meet
these responsibilities and, often, do a great
deal more.

Not so long ago, newspaper and magazine articles
were concerned about the effects of automation.
Millions of workers seemed destined for the job
scrap heap.'lBut considerable automation is here
and employment figures have gone up, not down.
Obviously those concerned with the problem in
business handled their part with a keen sense

of responsibility. ’

And some businesses have taken a step further.
IBM, one of the giants in the field, recently ear-
marked $5 million for a 10-year Harvard study
on the effects that the new technologies and
automation will have on our society.

Thomas J. Watson, Jr., IBM Chairman, summed

up the company's motivation in a recent Nation’s
Business article: ”Hopefully this work will help
generate the understanding and ideas our country
needs to get the full benefits of technology

while minimizing disruption and hardship.”

Business, today, offers unparalleled opportunities
for action. For initiating projects that can
beneficially change our society—our way of life.
Business, however, needs men with vision——with
the kind of foresight that extends beyond a desk,
office, division, or company. Men that can
literally see into the future and project how what
they are doing today can "make a contribution
tomorrow.

Gymnasts Open Season Against Slippery Rock

by ANDY -SWARTZ

Coach Warren Neiger’s gym-
nastics team opens the season to-
morrow at 7:30 p.m. against Slip-
pery Rock College in the Trees
Hall Gym. Coach Neiger isn’t
making any predictions for the
upcoming season but feels the
team is improved from last year.

Returning from last year's team
are co-captains lg Perez and Jim
Sacco. Both men are able to par-
ticipate in the six major events
and one will be the all-around
participant on the team. Also re-
turning will be Dave Shideman—
tle who last year won the East-
ern longhorse championship.
Shidemantle will be sidelined in
this event until January because
of an injury but will most likely
be able to compete on the tram-
poline.

The specialists include a great-
ly improved Tom Fisher on the
still rings, Bob Laurenzano on

the floor exercises, and Bob Dod-
son in all events.

A varsity soccer player, Dave
Shimpeno has just come out for
the team and is specializing on
the trampoline.

Handicapping this season is the
loss of Dave McKinnis through
graduation. Last season McKin-
nis led the gymnastics team in
every event and could win at
least three events on a good day.

There are seven events in a
gymnastics meet with a maxi-
mum of four boys from each
team in one event. Six of these:
the ﬂoor exercise, side horse,
horizontal bar, parallel bar, long-

horse, and still rings are in-
cluded in the all around divi-
sion. The seventh event, the
trampoline, isn’t.
