About 400 _Pitt students have

"been located in temporary housing
because of a room shortage created
by record numbers of returning

upperclassmen and incoming.

"freshmen contracted for University

housing and food service, accord-
ing to Director of University
Housing Tom Albert.

The students, mostly transfers
and freshmen, will be housed in the
Webster Hall Hotel, Carlow Col-
lege dormitories, lounges in
Holland Hall, the Lothrop Street
nursing residence, and triple
occupancy rooms in Holland Hall. P

The over-contracting occurs
every year and students are placed
in Webster Hall Hotel rooms, but
this marks the first time the
University has had to convert
lounge areas into living quarters

to accomodate an overload of_

students.
The Housing Office also has
located rooms in the Point -Park

-College dorms V, to be placed on

emergency hold in the event more
studentsneed housing.

“If students were to live in the
Point Park dorms, they would be
provided with PAT bus tickets, and
would have the alternative of
eating in the Point Park "cafeteria or
here at Pitt.” Albert said.

V “We had a record number of .
students who drew for rooms and ‘

more freshmen opted for dorm
housing this year,” Albert said,
‘ ‘but we found room for everyone.’ ’
Albert and the Housing Office
have been trying to ﬁnd room for
everyone since early May. At that
time, the office sent letters out to
every resident, offering a release
from the housing contract and
return of the $100 down-payment.
Sixty people accepted the offer to
cancel their housing contracts.
Other efforts included the
converting of lounge areas into

dorm rooms and changing some
double occupancy rooms in Holland
Hall into triple occupancy rooms.

“We converted doubles to triples
in Holland Hall on a square footage
basis,” said Albert, "offering a
reduced rental fee to occupants of
these rooms.”

Students already contracted to
the converted triple occupancy
rooms have the options of moving
into double rooms in Holland Hall,
staying in the same rooms or

‘cancelling their housing contracts.

Students .in the converted triple
rooms and lounge areas will be the
first to be moved into standard
dorm rooms as they become
available, Albert noted.

' Albertsaid he had input from the
Resident Student Association
(RSA) and individual students
while making the housing adjust-
ments. Initially, many students
objected to the addition of a third
resident into their rooms and

City Decay (5

BY GENE GRABOWSKI i

Because a great many upper-
classmen are returning to the
dorms in the fall and an
exceedingly large number of
freshmen have been admitted to
Pitt with the promise of housing,
the University has been caught
short again. on available living
space.

It happens every year, but each
year it seems to get worse.

Every fall, more and more
students are housed in the Webster
Hall Hotel because there's no room
for them in the Towers or the Quad,’
yet the figures show no appreciable
increase in matriculating fresh-
men.

Prospects  in Strike

. Against Pittsburgh Press

BY BOB MAYO

The strike against The Pitts-
burgh Press Co. by Teamster
delivery truck drivets entered its
fourth day today with the prospect
city" residents would be without
daily newspapers indefinitely.

“The P strike could go on
forever,” said Teamster spokes-
man Joseph Pass in a statement
‘Saturday.

‘Pass’ remark came after the

Press was denied its appeal to"

overturn a lower court’s ruling that
drivers of Teamsters Local 211 had
a limited right to strike under a
supplemental agreement to their
contract.

“The Press has not shown abuse
of disgressionary power (by the
teamsters) according to the district
court," ruled Judge Weis of the
Third District Court of Appeals in
an emergency session held in his
chambers Saturday. ,

V "The dispute between the Team-

ster drivers and the Press began
late last week after the company
had assigned one union member to
work at a job in addition to the one
he held ﬁve nights a week.

The drivers contended this was
abuse ofthe company’s agreement
and voted 318 to 36 in a Thursday
evening session to strike.

The Pittsburgh , Post-Gazette,

which is printed at the Press"

facilities on the Boulevard of the
Allies, downtown, was also af-
fected by the strike vote. The
Post-Gazette will not be published
until‘ the truckers go back to work.

The Press offered before Judge
B. McKune to reassign the worker
to the original position despite the
lack of need there pending
resolution of the grievance. The
union, however, rejected this as an
insufﬁcient settlement for return-
ing to work.

Judge McKune ruled under the

A grant proposal that might have
netted Pitt $210,000 has been
withdrawn by Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Dean Jerome Rosenberg,
following the dismissal of ‘Arcadi
Nebolsine, the director of the
Cultural .Environment'Program

The proposal was withdrawn,
according to Rosenberg, because
“there was insufficient support
within the faculty to continue the
program.”

The proposal for theeventual
$210,000 grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities
(NEH) was for a" Cultural Environ-
ment" Program of unique kind in the
nation, and received personal
attention from NEH Deputy Direc-
tor Harold C. Cannon.

In a March letter to Rosenberg,

I

The reason for this problem
seems to be that upperclassmen,
for the most part, are finding
dormitory living at Pitt preferable
to Oakland’s apartment living.

Apparently, these students are
discovering that high rents, leaking
faucets and ‘long walks are not
much better than three squares in
the cafeteria and maid service--
especially when the two ways of life
cost about the same.

It used to be that apartment
living was considered much better
than life» in the dorms. The rent
was cheaper, living quarters were
roon-ier and more private, and food
was cheaper and tastier.

Now though, it appears that rent
has increased, the cost of good food
has skyrocketed and the luxurious
living quarters of Oakland have
deteriorated nearly into slums. '

Grant Lass

Cannon expressed concern over the 
success of the grant proposal in the 

wake of Nebolsine’s dismissal.

1 According to Nebolsine, the first
stage of the proposal rejected by
the University amounted to
$30,000, which is usually followed-
the second year by $180,000. . '

Rosenberg said the proposal was _ 

not actually “lost” by the.

University, since only about 15%‘of .

proposals nationwide are finally.-
given an award. ,

“We had submitted a proposal, .
but there were some problems with
it. He (Nebolsine) missed a_
deadline and there was not
sufficient support from the rest of
the faculty for the proposal.”

Nebolsine received notice in the '

spring of 1973 that he would not be .
considered for tenure, according to‘

University policy. Rosenberg kept
Nebolsine as a lecturer for an extra
year, the dean said, because of the _
grant proposal’s possibilities.

“This is of the category that is
supposed to involve a substantial
number of faculty- people and I was
unable to ﬁnd faculty to take
responsibility for the grant after
Dr. Nebolsine’s was terminated,”
Rosenberg said.

The Cultural Environment pro-
gram at Pitt dealt with the impact
of ecology and other factors on the
“quality of life” in urban areas and
was involved in projects in the
Oakland community.

by some as part of the administra-

“At this point we are trying to
minimize the inconvenience to the

William Voharas, an RSA Board

According to Albert, the Housing

“Next year, the Vice-Chancellor

Grey Harris as chairman of the
Slavic studies department.
According to one source, Nebol-
sine, serving with the Slavic
department as part of his Univer-
sity contract, was terminated to
make room for Harris, who was a
department “outsider” from Indi-
ana University of Pennsylvania.
Nebolsine’s termination was
effected in 1973 and the grant
proposal was in _a “shaky”
position‘, according to Rosenberg.

“The grant had nothing to do

with Slavic Studies,” Rosenberg.

‘said, “and it was our decision that
Dr. Nebolsine served no long-term
purpose for the University mission.

I had no justiﬁcation for continuing
his contract.”

Nebolsine contends he was
removed from the tenure stream to
enable him to work on the grant
proposal in question, and was
assured of this arrangement by
Assistant to the Provost Joseph
Shobin.

the [proposal was in good-
standing with the NEH and had a
good chance of approval, as
indicated by Cannon’s highly
irregular trip from Washington DC
to _aid in writing the proposal,
according to Nebolsine.

In the wake’ of Nebolsine’s
dismissal and the controversial
appointment of Harris to the post of
Slavic studies chairman, Slavic
have or-
ganized to stop funding of the
University from State sources,
according to Virginia Harberth
governor of the Ad Hoc Slacie
Committee. ‘

“We are concerned over this
money. That grant could have
helped the community all around
the University,” Harberth "said. _

Before a student chooses a room,
or a roommate, the Ofﬁce of
Residence Life and the Housing

of booklets, notes and pamphlets--
all designed to explain and entice a
freshman to choose from a variety

comes time for registering, dealing

exams. ,

RA’s are usually tolerant and
ﬂexible. And if you are nice to your
RA, he probably will be nice to you.

THE ROOMMATE

Aside from the RA, your
roommate is the ﬁrst person with
whom you will have to deal. If you
are not already acquainted with

your roommate, keep in mind that
he is just as nervous about sharing
a room with someone he knows
nothing about as you are. You
probably can start a conversation

with your roommate the same way
would start a conversation with
anyone else you don’t know; music,
sports, What do you want to major
in? Why did you come to Pitt?
Remember, no one ever said you
and your roommate have to be best
friends and constant companions.
As long as you can live in the same
room and adapt to each other’s
living habits, you should have a
pretty good chance of surviving the
year.

THE ROOM

After you move into the dorincr 

and locate your roommate, you may
want to set up some ground rules to
allow eachrperson the optimum in
space and privacy, a truly valuable
commodity when living on a ﬂoor
with 40 to 50 other people. In the

person 96 “square” feet. A single

THEATRE

For those of you with the fortune

the sum_m_e_r months in Pittsburgh,
an array of parading peacocks sets
the summerstock stages. Down-
town at Heinz Hall “Broadway is
spending its summer.” You call
that a vacation? But the Civic Light
Opera has hoisted its sail on every
taxi in town and Ken Berry, Jack
Gilford and others provide the best
in cotton-candy entertainment.
But enough of these lazy, hazy
days. Pittsburgh shifts into first
gear once the ‘autumn months
return. Pitt provides a chocolate-
box assortment of theatrical’good-
ies. Lights, costumes and makeup
(as well as actors) adorn both the
mainstage Stephen Foster and the

this year’s productions--part of a

‘ plan to expose--through theatre--

Pittsburgh's heritage. Last year

walls of Foster’s Memorial.

But the most exciting theatre at
Pitt dwells in the Cathedral’s
basement when experimental
plays--directed, designed and often
written by students--are given the
platform. Nearly 15 productions
are slated per calendar year; many
of them invite audience, participa-

“Floating” through town this
coming season is director Dick

Cent Floating Theatre. Guest
companies, troupes and artists
come to display 'their - theatrical
wares in Pittsburgh’s cultural
market. They perform under no
special roof, but wander through-
out the city limits.’ For the price of
$1 (with a gum drop as your
change), you can see minstrels,
mimes and others provide unusual

. and entertaining bits of magic.

is proud to announce the‘ arrival of

indication of where artistic director
Ben Shaktman's “artistic impuls-
es" are pumping.

But ahead lies a rough and
bumpy path: that of community
theatre in Pittsburgh. Unfortun-
ately, community and repertoire
have remained distant friends.
Chancery Lane, Pittsburgh Lab-
oratory Theatre and Camelot
Productions provide roller-coaster
entertainment. The ride is
enjoyable but the end never comes
too soon. .

Carnegie-Mellon University's
drama department, one of the
nation's most prestigious, closes its
studio productions to everyone.
However, it does make the
mainstage available for viewing.
What really happens in the
workshops and studios of Car-
negie-Mellon? It is a loss for the
community that it may never know.

FILM

For celluloid addicts, Pittsburgh
offers as fine scope and range as
any city outside New. York,-Boston,
Los Angeles, or D.C. And for the
Oakland area dwellers, a toy chest
overflowing with foreign and
non-commercial classics awaits.
Pittsburgh Film-Makers (Oakland

needs, with the works of Bergman,

regular offerings. ~-

Learning Skills Center Aids Study Game.

Coming to a large urban
university’ can be a real hassle.
Some classes have as manyias 200
students, and with some 13,000

That help is available for free at

the Learning Skills Center on the‘

fifth floor of Sehenley Hall.

You might find, for example,
your old study habits aren’t good
enough for college, or you might

courses. If you have these
problems, contact the Learning

Exploding Pgh.’s Myths

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Now that you are approaching life at an urban university, there are
some terrible misconceptions about Pittsburgh you'll probably come
across:

l) Pittsburgh is dirty.

2) Pittsburghers drink beer, chew snuff and smell of mill sweat.

3) Pittsburghers are the worst kind of sports fanatics, using any
event to indulge in mass hysteria. ’

4) Pittsburgh is a cultural wasteland,
decadence of the Greenwich Village-Andy Warhol-New York East and
the smooth Counter Culture West.

It’s all wrong. Like any urban center, Pittsburgh maintains traces of
the_darker side of American culture, but still has a few charms to go
around.

Born in the jihad of the Pittsburgh Renaissance, Point Park and the
Gateway Center serve as examples of another Pittsburgh: clean,
urbane, sharp and modern.

stranded between the’ 

There is a spiritual confusion in the city: mill-town and executive ‘

HQ; the people who work on the line piece-rate and the people who
work in the air-conditioned universe of plush and cost-benefit analysis.

This irresistible centrifugal force of extremes hasn’t ripped the city
apart yet; the place still runs and people still manage to live here,
'mainly because they all have situated themselves on cultural islands.

Now Pitt in Oakland is as close as anywhere else in the city to the
center of all of these small nations. The bus or the bicycle can move
you across the intangible borders to any manner of kingdom you
desire.

Pittsburgh is alive with contrasts:
District; Heinz Hall and Three Rivers Stadium; the Wind Symphony
and Led Zeppelin; limos and bicycle routes.

This city has no single story, no overriding image, no matter how

- hard the public relations people push the Gigantic Point Park Fountain
or the Wonderous Confluence of the Mon and the Allegheny.

This is an ethnic city--food festivals and ethnic tabloids and block
parties and fraternal societies. It is an Amazon Jungle of social
diversity, of culture, of events and of the all~important Things to Do.

It’s true that steel built this place. From Oakland you can see the
burning and the cataclysm from the mills across the river. At night
they bake the clouds orange--an unexpected sunrise, air-borne neon
slowly coming and slowly gone.

The metal created this place. The mills crowd the rivers. and no one
here is out of their reach. The noise of the mills takes your sleep, the
iron dust is in your lungs, the chemicals are in your water, no one can
leave the mills for an instant in Pittsburgh.

But the myth of the Titan Steelworker bending the white-hot rails in
bare hands doesn’t apply anymore.‘ This city is made of islands.

Because the University is in the middle, you are free to explore. This

is no back-waters isolated academia, as much as some might want it to_ 

be. There are no walls between Us and Them; you are a Pittsburgher.
There isno super-consciousness here," so don’t watch for it. There

are no definitions here, so don’t speak /them. .
If you want to live here, take people for what ‘they say they are: If

Squirrel Hill and the Hill‘

they work the mill, they work the mill; if they research, they research._

It seems sometimes the geographic divisions of the city-—hills, rivers,

and valleys--have been reﬂected in the subculture society in ~

I Pittsburgh, and the trend in American society towards subcultures
seems to be an ultimate here.
So you can choose what you see and do in this city. The back-street’
civilizations are open; you can build any life-style you wish. 
In the pinball-pooltable-smoky bar-glory or the ﬁlm lectures and
museum tours, you can have what you need. In the neon sleaze and
porn of Liberty Avenue or the calm of Schenley Park,,you can take what
you want.
There is no great social mystique about this urban center, no single,
oppressive Hollywood panorama.
Mill-town, College-town, Suburbia, Slum...make your own city.

they created are the incidents that
shaped the top news stories of the
past year.

GOVERNOR SHAPP’S
PROPOSED BUDGET for next year
was announced March 11 recom-
mended a $65 million appropriation
over a 15-month period for Pitt,
which had requested at least $3
million more.

Pitt budget planners voiced
disappointment over the legislative
action, but could offer no immed-
iate analysis of what the smaller
appropriation would mean for the
future. -Executive Assistant to the

V. "- .\ Chancellor Ray Coble gave the ﬁrst
  indication of the internal book-
juggling that was to follow. <

“You always wish you had
gotten more,” Coble said,
we’ll just have to go to the books
and the data and go over this-for
some time.”

I The first administrative state-
ment on the probability of the
tuition bike was ‘offered by
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar on
March 13.

“If there is no major increase
from the State,” Posvar said, “we
shall face the necessity of ﬁnancial
hardship for all, including the

it possibility of a substantial tuition
increase.” - I

-. Posvar appealed to the state

ﬂy legislature in mid-March for an

after discovering Penn State and
Temple “ Universities received

10.78% and 8% budget increases"

respectively.‘ Pitt’s increase from
the,’St'ate‘for ﬁscal year 1975-76
amounted to 3.75%.
Posvar pinpointed the problem to
a cut of more than $3 million for
 student aid and public service in
 projected budget,_ as well as
a $2.9 million fund-shaving from
the state to balance monies
received by the University through
gifts and grants. ’ =
“Because Pitt has private
money, the State- reasoned that

 

“but

more funds weren't needed,"
Posvar explained.

Student response to the limited
state funding proposal and the
possibility of a tuition hike took the
form ofa massive campaign to blitz
the I-Iarrisburg legislators with
requests to increase, Pitt’s appro--
priation.

The blitz was named START-

More than 2,000 letters were
sent through START-UP to state
legislators in hopes of garnering
support for the University’s ﬁnan-
cial dilemma. . Although _the
state-wide impact of START-UP
was nearly impossible to estimate,

representatives later said'its
results were negligible. I '

Earlier that week, Shapp took a
ﬁrm stand with student govern-
ment representatives from across
the state, insisting no fat existed on
the Pennsylvania budget that could
be trimmed and given to higher
education.

“I can’t blame students for

"wanting more money,” Shapp said.

“But we have to deal with the
problem realistically. There is only

 

Provost Rhoten Smith termed it
“retrenchmerit”--the cutting back
of Pitt’s programs‘ in the face of

so much money in the entire state
pot.”

By the second week in June, the
legislators had proposed what now‘
seems to be the ﬁnal offer for
Pitt--$58238 million over a twelve-
month period.

A TUITION HIKE--levied at $70
per term--was announced less than
a week later. 1 I '

While Pitt’s state appropriation
still has not reached a ﬁnal vote,
legislators and administrators indi-
cate Harrisburg will approve the‘
$58 million budget.

Students interviewed on campus
appeared to be taking the tuition
increase in stride. Only minimum
difficulty, it seemed, had been
created by the boost, with most
students saying they would be
forced to spend less and work and
save more. '

In mid-June, Pitt planners
projected a financial squeeze for
the University within the next five
years.

As a result, the various branches
of the University are involved in a
long-range planning program in
which each school and its depart-
ments will determine which parts
of their services can be scaled down
or phased out.

Faculty unionization at Pitt
moved closer to a deciding vote
looming in fall term, with talks
continuing between the University
and labor groups appealing to the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
(PLRB) for differing bargaining
units.

So far the hearings have revolved
around the question of what
population of University staff will
comprise the bargaining unit to
vote for any union. ,

The University consistently has
demanded a University wide-union
to prevent divisions within the
institution. Other petitioning
groups have argued separate units
among Pitt’s schools.  .

Some unions have argued. ta
University-wide union would have
no central focus and would
comprise no effective labor unit.

Hearings are presented sched-
uled for wrap-up in July, and will
be followed by a decision by the
PLRB on the appropriate bargain-
ing unit, the last step before a
faculty vote in fall term.

    Pitt’s Many   Proud Traditions

i /' A,
 ,1)“

BY RITA VITOLO

“There’s pride in tradition,”

somebody famous once said, but .

pride, like tradition, is only what
you make it.
Pitt has layers of tradition--some
of its esoteric, and some the real
McCoy--traditions as diverse as the
“Skyscraper University,” the once-
proud Hotel Schenley and its
"apartments converted to urban
dorms, and the home of Jonas

Salk’s pioneering work» on the polio I

5 Vaccine.

. Pitt is the alma mater of Gene
Kelly and Regis Toomey; the
.3 ‘ presidents of three local banks; the
retiring president of U.S. Steel,
Wilbert Walker, and his replace-
ment, David Roderick; the city’s
Mayor and former mayor Joseph
Barr; state representative K.

‘ LeRoy Irvis and US Senator Robert A

 Fleming; two former White House

*7 physicians, George Berkeley and
Walter Tkach; a former Miss
America; the inventor of the TV
picture tube, Vladimir Zworykin;
and Nobel Prize winner Phillip
Hensch. And in May, 1921, Pitt
granted Marie Curie her fifth-ninth‘
honorary degree.

A national survey of universities
 released by the American Council
’).,_.,'‘on Education in 1970 showed Pitt to

be among the top 20 schools in the
nation in four departments, based
upon the quality of the graduate
programs offered and their -facul-
ties.D Philosophy was ranked as

- j -"fourth in the nation; anthropology,
.  13th; physiology, 15th; and phar-

I

macology, 16th.

Pitt’s ties with national research
foundations have made the Univer-
sity one of the prime sources of
academic consultants and one of
the major recipients of federal
dollars, according to Faculty of
Arts and Sciences (FAS) Dean
Jerome Rosenberg. They include:

--the Center for Russian and East
European _ Studies, one of eight
National Defense Education Act
centers for the study of Russian
and East European culture and
politics. "

--the departments of chemistry,
physics, and crystallography, re-
cently National Science Foundation
centers to develop excellence in
speciﬁc science ﬁelds.

This is also the university that’s
ranked ﬁfth in national sports

championships and whose football’

teams have been coached by two of

‘the all-time best--Jock Sutherland ‘

and Pop Warner.

There’s been one Bowl win in
seven attempts: a 21-0 rout over
Washington in 1936. Rose Bowl
losses came at the hands of
Stanford in 1927 and twice against
USC, in 1929 and again in 1932.
Add to that Sugar Bowl and Gator
Bowl losses to Georgia Tech, and
1973’s Arizona State-Pitt Fiesta
Bowl.

The most decorated solider of _the
Korean War, Anthony Herbert,

graduated from Pitt with a

journalism major in 1956. A

It was out of the School of
Medicine’s Virus Research Lab-
oratory that then~research profes-
sor of bacteriology Jonas Salk and
his research team tracked down
three strains of polio virus 25.years
ago on a grant from the National
,Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.
Later when word of the vaccine the
researchers were developing
leaked to New York columnist
Walter Winchell, he wrote “IT
MAY BE A KILLER.”

announced early in April that Pitt
Students would face an increase in
the cost of the University’s health
insurance program next year.
The increase was realized June
4. with Pitt accepting the proposed
Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance
plan. Cost of the plan is now
$122.52 for individual students,
and $291.60 for familycoverage, up
from $73.32 and $192.72 respec-
tively, under last year’s Blue
Cross/Blue Shield plan.

THE JAPAN IRON AND STEEL

‘FEDERATION gave $1 million to

Pitt's Asian Studies program in
May--the largest grant ever given

Pitt by a foreign benefactor. Asian .

Studies Department Chairman
William Dorrill said he planned to
spend only the interest on‘ the huge
endowment and leave the original
sum untouched. ‘

PITT’_S ROTC PROGRAM will be
combined with those of Carnegie-
Mellon and Duquesne beginning

this summer as a result of a May 5 -

decision announced by Pitt’s ROTC
chief Colonel .lohn.Roehm.

The move to combine the
programs was based on the drop in
ROTC enrollment "ﬁgures at the
schools over the past two years,
Roehm said.

Under the consolidation plan,
‘effective July 1, all Army ROTC
instructors, will operate through
Pitt's ROTC department, either
circulating among the three uni-
versities or teaching courses at Pitt
to CMU and Duquesne students

commuting to the Oakland camnus.

A-PITTSBURGH-BASED FOOD
SERVICE COMPANY. Key Man-
agement Services, was awarded a
contract to manage Pitt’s dining
facilities in mid-May.

The ﬁrm took over the job held
for thevpast three years by Szabo
Food Service in Illinois.

‘Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar accepted the first installment of a $1
million‘ gift to the Asian Studies Department from the Japan Iron and
Steel Federation, represented by T. Kobayashi and Tokuji Ohashi, in

April.

The contract will last for one year
and the University has the option to
renew it at the end of the winter
term. ,

SUPPORTERS OF THE PITT
PROFESSIONAL UNION ‘rallied
again on the Cathedral lawn June
24 to » protest the exclusion of
graduate student teaching employ-
ees from next year’s announced
salary increase.

The union demanded that Pitt’s.

graduate employees--TAs, TF5 and
RAs receive a $1,000-a-year wage
increase to counter the rise in the
cost of living.

“We're demanding our right to
bargain as a union to get the wage
increase we deserve,” said _.
spokesman Bob Nelson.

University officials countered
that the graduate employees would
receive the same percentage
increase in salary as all other
faculty members, but not the
$1,000, or 33% increase. ‘

-Panther Basketball

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

_When the 1974-75 Panther
basketball team was in its practice
stages early last fall, the question
 on campus was “What do it do for
_; 7 an‘ encore‘?_” .

rebounds and--more important--
intimidated the smaller Bears with
his long arms and great -leaping
ability.

Game two took place in the West
Virginia Colliseum, a place oppos-
ing teams often associate with
Auschwitz. ‘

With Warren Baker scoring 24
points in the second half, the
Mounties came back to win 82-78 in
overtime.

Throughout the game, the
Panthers had to chance to take a
commanding lead, but bad passes
and some cold shooting from the
foul line kep WVU in the contest.

Starr was again the main man for
the Panthers as he hit for 15 tallies.
With 3:41 left in the game,’ the
Pantherstried to stall with a 71-68
lead. Start-,hit the first end of a one
and one and things looked good for
the visitors.

Two minutes later, the picture
wasn’t quite as rosy--the score was
tied at 72. At the six-second mark,
defensive specialist Lew Hill found
himself all alone on the right side of

"the basket and popped a short
jumper from the sidelines.

The ball must have been too
shocked to do the right thing, for
it fell harmlessly off the rim. The
overtime was all West Virginia’s.

Pittsburgh’s Steel Bowl was the
next site of Panther action and
things were supposed to get better.
They didn’t.

Not only did the Cats lose the
prestigious city championship to
Duquesne, they lost the losers’
contest to Penn State.

games, with 34 rebounds and 41
points for two night’s work, but the §

' defense wasn’t in the best amoeba '§'

form as the Dukes and the Lions
shot 56%.

The St. Joseph Hawks were the
next target for the up-and-‘down
Panthers. The bird was plucked
72-60 as defense took center stage.

Marquette was supposed to be
the biggest test of the young
season, with the top-ten ranked
Warriors highly favored.

A funny thing happened

Playing a great second half, the
senior from Crafton pulled down 10
rebounds as the Cats held on for
65-58 upset.

The --leader of the team now
changed as Starr stepped down and
Kirk Bruce took over. St. Francis
was the unlucky opponent to feel
Bruce's leadership capabilities. He
poured in 32 points and the Blue
and Gold had won its second
straight, 85-65.

On the road, the win steak was
snapped when the Duke Blue
Devils put some chill into the
Panthers, 89-75. Bruce was a hot

“ASK if you can'tf1nd a book. It'd be good to come in now during
orientation to look around and ask questions while it’s not busy,"
Bonach invited. “And sure, our tempers may be a little short during
the first week, but ask anyway. That's what we're here for.”

A particular freshman blunder is to take the class section book list as
gospel. “Required” books are often scratched in a mid-September
professorial change of heart. “Recommended” books may never be
mentioned in class. At $7.95 or even $11.95 a book, it pays to be sure.

“Don't purchase books until you've gone to a class or two to save you
and us from being ripped off,” Crowley. advised. “The students think
we have a strict returns policy, but we're only trying to keep this a
bookstore instead of a lending library.”

Crowley emphasized that different sections of the same course may:

have different required books, so pay attention to the alpha code that
identiﬁes the sections.

And he urged students to search the stacks for books tagged with a
“used” sticker, for savings up to 25% . Although such books represent
only one per cent of the total. volumes in the store, they’re often
available during the first week. ’

sPitt’s Endless ‘Brunch’

For those who've registered, Bonach said the last weeks of August -

would be a good time to buy. By then most of the books are in stock
and the lines are short.

“But a lot of students said they didn't really mind waiting in
line--it's part of going to college. In fact, they said it was almost a
tradition,” Bonach said. .

So, come _September, when it’s 85 degrees, you’ll probably be
buying your textbooks. ’

The next night--against NC

20 minutes then rolled over and

sounded; the Pack rolled to an

During the past year, one
seminar not only learned together,
but lived together. Students .from‘
F.S. 42--“Literature in Perfor-
mance (newly dubbed “The Arts in
Performance”)--lived, on the 11th
and 12th floors of Tower B.
Attending a sampling of. poetry,

_ theatre film and dance events held
 Pittsburgh, they explored
 "everything from the Pennsylvania

Ballet Company to Walt Disney's
Alice in Wonderland.
. The only requirement for F.S. 42
this year is simple--students must
be dorm residents, making evening
trips more accessible.

“When we are excited about
something we see together, why
must we wait until Monday
between 3:00-4:20 to talk about it?
This way we just went back to our
rooms to bullshit for a couple of
hours,” explained sophomore and
former “Performance” student
Susan Wright.

“These weren't _just your
“school friends,” but the people on
fkyour floor. There’s a kind of
closeness that develops which can't
be removed from the class-
room/ﬁeld trip experience.”

0 Faculty and students alike have
likened the freshman seminar
program a haven for. those who
long for a “different kind” of
learning experience. “They are

‘safe’ and set for experimenta-
tion." Norman said. “Once the
students have gotten a taste in
their freshman year, they are apt to
seek other classes that offer a
similar experience."

One seminar is the limit that any
freshman may register for at his
initial registration. However, if
space- permits, others may be
added during the add/drop period
of each term.-

Our Purpose — Service

Thelook Center is owned and operated by the University of Pittsburgh.
The primary challenge facing the Book Center today is one of extending
service to the students of the University, its many" departments, faculty,
staff and alumni. i '

Morganizational Structure

The Book Center is a departmental ‘operation. Merchandise or services
offered are catagorized into four given areas or departments. These are
textbooks new and used, trade, supplies and sundries. Ail buying for these
areas is premised on three basic principles. First the item must be required
for a given course or program of the University. Items of this type are
naturally the textbooks, used books, and paperbacks. Second, trade depart-
ment items are made available that are necessary to supplement and com-
plement the course study and to enhance the cultural and academic signifi-
cance of the University. Third, supply department on the lower floor has
supply items for your every need, paper, notebooks, typewriters, and hun-
dreds of other items. Fourth, sundries department has all the professional
items,iengineering supplies, art supplies, records, pens and pencils and the

' availability of many. items extremely professional.

Newly published BOOKS OF GENERAL INTEREST, both hard cover and
paperback are on the street floor. More than 16,000 paperback and 12,000

cloth titles are displayed in separate sections by subject catagories. Period- 4

icals and JOURNALS (scholarly, literary,_, professional, and technical) are
displayed in this area. 0 A

POSTERS AND REPRODUGTIONS

Matted Reproductions, Plaques, Scrolls, Frames, ‘Art
Postcards. The wall here and elsewhere in the Book
Center enable a generous selection.

 

nzxrnooxs AND TSIIPPLIES

The Textbook Department is located on lower
floor. The books areshelved as in stocks of a
library. Here, however, the arrangement of
books is based upon the school and depart-
mental divisions of the University. Supply items
for your every need: paper, notebooks, type-
writers, and hundreds of other needed items.
Courteous store personnel are always willing
to serve you. whatever you need.

ART

With Carnegie Institute only a

opening of the new Sarah Scaife

thrown to the hungry mongers this
season? Only time and budget
appraisal will answer that one.
The University supports its own
gallery. located on the corner of

South Bouquet and Forbes Avenue. -

The UP Gallery holds .many
exhibitions that are free and open
to the public. Often, students’
work will adorn the wall and

ﬂoors, showcasing the best Pitt's

art students haveto offer. , .

Rounding out the art world is the
Kingpitcher Gallery, which is not
widely known, but deserves» a

‘ look-see. Often an; unpolished gem

is found lying in the streets of
Oakland. '

There you have it:_ the arts of
Pittsburgh spread. out one a

just to be tasted. Go on. Have a

. feast on me.

As we have noted, it has been argued that for the PPU to come
out against a tuition increase is illogical because its members will
‘benefit in the form of a salary raise which would not have other-
wise been forthcoming. Is it true that unionization of the faculty
is a major cause of tuition increases? We find that there is precious
little evidence for an answer in the affirmative. To begin with, the
increase in salaries and tuition didn't result from collective bar-
gaining between the Administration and the faculty. “Unioniza-
tion” cannot be the cause of the current tuition hike. Salaries at
all ranks at Pitt are lower than salaries at many other colleges and
universities. It comes as no surprise that Harvard and other Ivy
League universities pay their faculties higher salaries than those
paid at Pitt. But City University of New York, a state-related
‘university like Pitt, also pays its faculty salaries which are several

and the Tuition lncreasei
An Open Letter to the.Pitt Student B

"Although inflation and recession -are now solidly established as

integral characteristics of American economic and social life, the
announcement of a $70/term, $140/year (approximately 14%) ,
increase effective-September‘ 1, 1975, comes as a real blow to '

_ -many-students. Chancellor Posvar has correctly pointed out that"
' students ‘from working class and low income families will be
especially hard hit. The University of Pittsburgh, which according

-to a “Parade” magazine survey, already charged the third highest

~ tuition of all state-related universities in the nation before the

' present —increase,‘seems tobe aiming toward the number one spot.

V‘ The Administration would like you to believe that the interest of «
students in low cost, ‘quality educationand the interest offaculty

and teaching personnel are diametrical-ly opposed. Unions mean "
A --highersalaries, they suggest. Higher salaries must in turn be paid‘
for? -by increasing tuition. Wedisagree with this viewpoint and
think that it goes against the immediate and long-term interest of

Thereis an old and widespread notion that university professors
inhabit an “ivory tower” and cannot be bothered with such
mundane questions as how much students have to pay to attend
their classes. However, prevalent this Olympian detachment
might have been in the past, it forms no part of the outlook of

the Pitt Professional Union, Local’3414, American Federation

of Teachers, AF L-CIO. As scholars, teachers, and union members,
we say that whether or not our students can afford to attend Pitt
is indeed a concern of ours. We have in the past consistently
‘ opposed any tuition increase at Pitt. We oppose the present

 

    
  

time has maintained much lower tuition costs than Pitt. In fact,

, three Pennsylvania STATECOLLEGES have higher salaries than

Pitt, an important ‘consideration in the present discussion because
tuition charges are also lower than at Pitt. Not accidently, the.

_ faculties of CU NY and the three Pennsylvania state colleges have . 
_ all achieved collective bargaining. Pitt faculty actually took’-a 1 _ _
salary cut in 1974-75 when one allows for inﬂation. The projected .-
‘ increase for 1975-76 ofkfive to eight per cent is still less than-the

the rise in the cost of living and far less than the 14% increase ' .
in ‘tution. ln short, there is simply no consistent correlation A
between tuition levels and unionization. A i ~ j _ _
WHAT STUDENTS. AND FACULTY CAN DO A ~ -

First, we should recognize that ,students_ and faculty have a com-‘ ' A A
- mon interest in preserving and improving the quality of Pitt

education, and that we are both threatended by the budgetary
crisis. Second, the Administration cannot act for us alone, as we *

i have leanred from its unsuccessful past attempts to achieve

adequate funds for the University from the Legislature. At best,
the Ad_minist_ration has only the power to implement decisions
made elsewhere. Third, today we have neither student power nor
‘effective faculty power in the form of collective bargaining,
despite the fact that the problems we face are more urgent than i
ever before. The PPU, through its affiliation with the American
Federation of Teachers, has joined the National Coalition for‘
Lower Tuition in Higher Education, which includes the National
Students Association, the AAUP, the American Association of
University Women and the AF L-CIO. The Coalition will use

its influence and resources in an aggressive campaign at the ,
national and state level to reduce or eliminate tuition at institu-
tions of higher learning in the United States. It will bring pressure
to bear on members of Congress, federal officials, leaders of state .
and municipal governments, boards of trustees to increase aid to
higher education and review all present and proposed federal
higher education programs in terms of their effect upon tuition
policy. In recognition of this, organized labor’s only representa-
tive on the Board of Trustees voted against the increase. At Pitt,

we of the PPU pledge that student representatives will be informed ,

of and involved in the collective bargaining negotitaions between
the teaching employees and the University. This will enable
students to have some draft input into any negotiations that could
result in changes in tuition. We invite you to work together with

‘ us in support of this goal.

Season in Review

’75; Football’s Year to Recall?

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

Johnny Majors came to Pitt late
in 1972 after leading Iowa State to a
bowl appearance for the first time

‘ anyone could remember.

He quickly was tabbed a miracle
by the press and was expected to
do big things with the nowhere
Panther program.

“A Major Change
Football” became a rallying cry as
‘Majors imported hunks of beef
from junior colleges across the
nation to start his winning ways.

He also picked up a kid named
Tony Dorsett.

The program turned around from
1-10 to 6-4-l, including a trip to the
Fiesta Bowl. The change indeed
had been a “Major” one.

Last year, depending on to whom
you talked, the Panthers were in
the top 100, the top 50 and even the
top 20 in the country in preseason
polls.

Majors is a smart coach and
shook off those high claims. He
told all to wait and see.

For one thing, most of .the
offensive line of ’73 was missing--
and, no matter how well TD can run
if there’s no one in front of him, so
what?

The Panthers’ first game of the

1974 season was a case in point. It .

was the defense that saved the day
for the Panthers as they squeaked
past the Florida State Seminoles,
9-6, on a day when the temperature
and humidity ran a race to see
‘ which could climb higher.

The defense was the whole story
for the Cats. It shut the door on the
Seminoles after the first five

7 minutes of the contest. FSU led
< six-zip.

Dorsett could manage only 81
yards on 23 carries and all of them
were hard fought, as the State
defense keyed on the sophomore

every play.

 Maj...  races   Toughliffschedule 

BY RICK SHRUM

This fall, in the legendary Land
of Majors, the Pitt football team
will attempt to commit man-
slaughter on a Godzilla schedule,
using the speed of so many
Formula 11 running backs and the
youth of a ninth-grade dance.

It will be a team filled with
sophomores and juniors with
precious little game experience, a
large portion of whom cover 50

_,,,-_,yards by foot in times‘ like 4.5

ieconds. and they’ll be aiming to

P . slay Brobdignagian schools like

Georgia, Oklahoma, West Virginia,
Notre Dameand Penn State.

. “We’re going into the toughest
schedule in the history of the
school,” said Head Coach Johnny

Majors, the southern Messiah"

preparing for his third year here.
“We’re young, too--this will be the
smallest group of seniors that
I've ever worked with.”

“But though I’m satisﬁed, I-

am pleased with the progress
we’ve made. We’re heading in the
right direction.” A

The right direction this season is
dependent on several variables,
which are: a) the quarterback
' ' jation; b) the success or lack-
thereof of the Veer; c) the quality of
the offensive line; and d) the size of
the defensive holes to be ﬁlled due
to graduation.

Indeed, of extreme importance to
Major Change, Part III, will be the
resolution of the quarterback issue.

There’s Robert Haygood, a
diminutive and explosive junior
who slashes, cuts and darts like a
frenzied gazelle. And there's
sophomore Matt Cavanaughﬂthe
brains and the cool, the meticulous
runner-thrower who leads and
offense not unlike graduated Bill
Daniels, for whose position Hay-
good and Cavanaugh will vie, did.

“They’re both prime candidates

":rlfor,,the starting job,” conceded
"Majors, who has transformed an

impoverished grid program into
something bearing fruit" again.
“They’re both young and don’t

have much game experience, but
they have some ﬁne ability that will
help us in the future--hopefully the
near future." '

As of now, according to Majors,
gazelle Haygood is THE MAN, but
Cavanaugh’s not to be discounted.

,And then there is the Veer.
which, translated, means:
“Speed--rubber-burning, feet blis-
tering, see-ya-later speed.”

Foremost in the Veer, of course,
is the inimitable Tony “TD”
Dorsett. The junior from Hope-
well, the kid with the parking“
tickets and winged feet, raced in
last season with 1,000-plus rushing
yards for the_second straight year.
And despite part-time physical
disability. . '

Complementing him admirably,
however, will be wunderkind Elliot
‘Walker and fullback Robert Hut-
ton, erstwhile blocker and power-
plougher. Both garnered better
than 100 yards in the spring game
and are durable. With wide
receiver Karl Farmer and possibily
freshman end Gordon Jones also at
the disposal of Haygood, the Cats’
attack could be aversion of NASA
in Adidas.

.“Our biggest asset is the speed
we have in the backﬁeld,” Majors
said. “We want to take advantage
of it. Sure, there always are
questions whenever you put in a
new system. But we’ve worked on V
the Veer somewhat the last two
years, and don’t think we’re going
into it blind.”

The Veer, though, is predicated
on good blocking, quick, crisp,
momentary-hole-opening blocking,
which the ‘ Panthers may ﬁnd
absent because graduation strip-
ped away center Mike Carey and
guard Reynold Stoner, and farming
was considered more attractive
than helmet-crunching to tackle
Theo Lawrence.

“We lost some keyline people,”
Majors agreed. “Only Joe Stone of
Replacing
them, and replacing those we lost
on defense, will be a great factor in
determining our success this fall.”

For two seasons defense has
determined the success of the
Panthers. It should again, for
behind every potent offense of
every winner stands a preventative
corps with the approximate resil-
iency of the China Wall. Majors
must work toward cohesing that
unit.

To begin, one-man fortress Gary
Burley, the middle guard, is gone,
and with him hole-closer linebacker
Kelcy Daviston and secondary men
Mike Bulion,' Glenn Hodge and
David Spates.

Call the current situation Con-
temporary swiss Cheese.

“We have some kids who are
making good progress there,” said
Majors, pointing out Randy Cozens

Jim Cramer and Jim Farley in‘

particular. “And we have Tom
Perko, Denny Moorhead, Arnie
Weatherington and Don Parrish
back. We’re making progress.”

The vtriumvirate of Cozens-
Cramer-Farley is a collectively
unique story. Cozens, a senior end
whose career here has been of the
obscurity of Mervis Hall, was voted
most improved Panther this spring;
Cramer, a junior from Thomas
Jefferson High who left Ohio State
after discovering Woody Hayes
was as affable as Dean Corll, was
superb at middle linebacker in the
spring game; and Farley, ex-tight
end, performed capably at mon-
ster. _

They--read everyone--must con-
tinue to do so up to and including
the September 6 opener at Georgia,
and thereafter--like September 20
at Oklahoma, and on through to the
conclusion with West Virginia,

"Notre Dame and _Penn State.

All of which Majors considers
“bowl games.”

“I think that right now everyone
everywhere would like to go to a
bowl. We can’t. Over the next two
months, all we’ll think about is our
ﬁrst_bowl game--at Georgia; then
our next bowl game--at Oklahoma.

“The 'season’s going to be
tough...a grind,” Majors conclud-
ed.

Youngstown put the Panthers
back on the victory trail and also
was the loser in Ridl’s 300th career
win.

Bucknell’s Bisons were next on
the schedule, but playing in Philly
is not tempting to any team, as the
Cats learned in a 70-66 loss. Bruce
and Starr were high scorers with 17
apiece, while Bennett again was
the big rebounder with eight.

When Notre Dame came to town,
it sported the nation’s leading
scorer in the person of Adrian
Dantley, who lived up to his title by
hitting for 17 points in the first half.

Analyzing Dantley’s secret
proved none too hard for Ridl; he
sent Hill in during the second half
to cool off the big sophomore. The
strategy worked: The Irishman hit
but two buckets the rest of the
evening, with the Cats winning
88-77 in overtime.

“When you lay your life down in

sometime.” (from “Fair Warn-

There are worlds other than our
own and to deny their existence is
to deny the basic knowledge of
humanity. The basic and unending
truth that we are and will be. A
truth from a purely personal view,
admittedly, but a truth spreading
around these days. It’s a little
something I picked up listening to
the ocean and watching the stars
and moon at night...Can I possibly
‘think thatl am the center of the

makes sense that there should be
more to this than we’re being told.
Right? I mean allthose stories in

wiser than myself and others, have
told of places impossible to dream
up_or create on pulp.

I  ..  itggot there that fascinates me.
The process of transferring the
sthought energy to paper and pen to

chariots, with ﬁre breathing seven-
headed dragons is a bit much for
me to actually realize. It makes me
ask: Do other folks have a better

 « 7 ybr cavern we call the soul. John

1;‘

“oltrane was certainly one to tell us
that. With each succeeding album
Todd Rundgren has reached

further into the pit and brought up

more and more of his own soul and
demonstrated that via the harmonic
vibrations of electronic music one
may attain a level of awareness
and, even, understanding of the
basic human truth.

It began with the Nazz...over-
looked and underrated as a pop
force...and continued with his solo
Runt efforts. With Something?/
Anything he clearly smashed his
musical-mobile into the rock wall
by showing that without a doubt
one man can create lyrically and
musically a bastillion of hope and
inner strength with vinyl. Wizard
lost people with its concept and
Todd most definitely blew cosmic

.dust in their faces. -

.Utopia gave him partial com-
mercial success with the release of
“The Ikon” on radio. Its funky
sound appealed to a‘ wider
spectrum of listeners than Todd is
quite used to. But in theory it too

ﬂew over their heads with its

commitment to toal communion in
music. The polyrhythms and
atonal styles of Moog and guitar,

although heard, were not absorb-

ed...more like audibly imbibed. In
an interview I had had with him he
said, “Words are meaningless.

"The music is what gets you the

highest. It is. almost like losing
yourself...or Self...and achieving a
higher level.” He referred to

-cosmic conciousness and the Zen

satori. ~

Satori is attaining...the interim
process...total oneness. For him it
has become not only a,_personal_
life-goal, but’ a deeply ‘involved
musical experience. One must be
aware of Todd’s forsaking of the
traditional Western diet for a
vegetarian one and his embodi-
ment of a non-drug, non-alcohol
and hard-work life style. The
-plastic wafﬂes he produces are not
idle money making adventures; on
the contrary--they are indeed
highly polished endeavours into
other forms of musical expression.

This elpee was inspired by the
reading of Alice B. Bailey’s
-“Treatise On Cosmic Fire” (Lucis,
.1952), which also is side two’s
title--an instrumental with Todd
performing all the music.
“Treatise” is a four-part piece
composed of I. The internal ﬁre, II.
The ﬁre of mind, III. The fire of
spirit and an Intro and an outro.

parts with Hindu and Zen
affiliations abounding. This piece
is one for internalization. That is to
say one must not listen to this
music but be felt by it. The lowest

5 bass note and highest frequency on

the high end should and must be
digested. Only when the energy of
stomach muscles loosening and
heart tensions relaxing is felt
should one say, “I have heard this
work.”

Side one’s more easily accessible
lyrics are still more difficult to
ingest than most commercial tunes.
In “Real Man” he says more than
I can possibly hope to hear from
any other working musician today.
“I see with my heart/ I hear with
my heart/ I feel with my heart.”
The pure electricity of some
performers" have given them
so-called success. . .monetary gains.
Todd’s electrical exposes have
given him and his audience
understanding. He can do a lot
with an SG and a phase shifter. His
puncturing of empty air with-
tenuous stacatto notes breaks
conscious survival...clinging onto
real thoughts .and real notes and
-real tones. With it he cleanses and
rejuvenates.
metal pickups ampliﬁed through
metal. Cold steel and vibrating
molecules. Pulsating skin and
rubbing at the innard from within.
It’s no easy lesson.

‘ “Fire Warning” is a song to his
fans and foes. “But I picked up
this banner and I just can’t/ put it
down.” The road has to be walked
alone, he says, if you can walk it
all. It seems to sum up the past
four years of musical jostling and
rock and roll battling with the
victors,\...well, there are no victors
as such, just a few critics at each
other’s throats and passing out
between shows. The Armagedon
of music entrepeneurs may very
well be hosted here in Pittsburgh
with the world series of rock. It
may have already been staged with
Altamont..

The heeding to a fair warning
may be delayed and one’s internal
dialogue henceforth slowed to the
point...the point that id where
words become meaningless...and
thoughts, well they become.
“Here we are again the. start for
the end, and there’s more.”

From Quantum to Occult

BY HARRIS LEVY

Accept no substitutes. The

Whole Earth Catalog has had many .

imitators but nobody hassurpassed
its staggering exhaustiveness.
Now there’s a new book that has
learned, not merely copied, from
the Whole Earth Catalog as well as
updating and expanding the
Catalog itself.

AN INDEX OF POSSIBILITIES:
Energy and Power By the
Catalogue, $5.95 [paperback].
Pantheon. 292 pages.

WHOLE EARTH EPILOG $4
[paperback]. Point/ Penguin. 330
pages.

The Catalogue, a group of eight
British men and women, has
produced a book that emulates the
format and eclecticsm of The
Whole Earth Catalog. Not as lively
or as amateur for those of you who
can still attach some positive
connotations to that word as the
Catalog, the Index is a thorough,
concise, illustrated compliation of
theories and research.

With sources from Steppenwolf
to Scientiﬁc American, the Index
has drawn material on diverse
topics, including Quantum Mech-
anics and religions. I’m still
skeptical about some of the
religous and occult stuff but the
scientiﬁc discussions on modern

' physics, the earth and the human

body are useful and’ informative.

But that’s the point. The Index
just lays out all the material on a
subject and it’s up to you to decide
what you believe in.

A note at the back says that this
volume on Energy and Power was
conceived as the first of ﬁve, with
successors tentatively titled Struc-
tures and Dialogue already con-
I for one am looking
forward to them.

Meanwhile, back in the USA...

Stewart Brand and his many
collaborators have issued a sequel
to the Whole Earth Catalog. The
Epilog, the new continuation,
contains an index to both volumes.

Whole Earth Epilog is similar to'
its predecessor but is better
organized. In addition to the index,
Epilog’s chapters contain detailed

contents pages and brief listings '

called “Cream Rises” that give

readers cross—references. Both
new features make it a lot easier to
located speciﬁc topics.

Otherwise it’s more of the
same. Epilog has chapters on
areas like Whole Systems, Land
Use, Shelter, etc.
but basically the
covered in the ﬁrst volume.
According to Brand’s introduction,
the Epilog’s information is “den-
ser, ﬁner, and more accurate.”

Like the Catalog, Epilog has a
story whose chapters are dispersed
throughout. This time, it’s a satire
of TV’s Kung Fu by Realist editor
Paul Krassner.

The Epilog is fun to browse
through and useful for ﬁnding
sources of information and pro-
ducts. And where else will you ﬁnd
a book that begins on page 449?
