When the Western University of
Pennsylvania moved from Allegheny
in 1908 to the Schenley Farm’s dis-
trict, it entered a period that has
been marked tremendous expansion,
in students, in physical equipment,
and in curriculum. Starting out
with State Hall (originally intended
for the school of Mines), Thaw Hall
and the Medical building, it has
spread out like ivy all over the hill-
side and has sent tendrils to down-
town Pittsburgh, and even outside
of Pittsburgh to Erie, Johnstown
and other western Pennsylvania
cities.

Up until 1920, Dr. Samuel Black

tus, was Chancellor. In that year he
was succeeded by the incumbent
Chancellor, Dr. John-Gabbert Bow-
man.

. The original area encompassed by

a University.

Pitt in the Oakland district was
forty-three acres in extent, ‘but it
has now nearly doubled . to eighty-
one acres. The former Bailey prop-
erty on which the Stadium was bui t,
the fourteen acre quadrangle where
the Cathedral of Learning is being
built, and the old Porter estate that
will accommodate the medical cen-
ter, largely account for the increased
acreage.
Many New Schools

The broadening of the curriculum
during this period included the ad-
dition of the schools of Mines, Busi-
ness Administration Education, the
Graduate School, Mellon Institute,
Research Bureau for Retail Train-
ing, Extension Division, Downtown
Division, Summer Session and the
Radio Studio. The extension divi-

thirty-ﬁve years, and who will re-
ceive her bachelor of arts degree
from Pitt at the Charter Day com-
mencement exercises this month.

Not only is Mrs. Hammond known
as a teacher and: student, but she
has also done notable work as editor
of a history journal, director of mu-
sical and theatrical groups, sponsor
of clubs, and mother of one son.

In 1890 -Mrs. Hammond received
her ﬁrst teaching position, although
she was’ only sixteen years of age,
and some bf her pupils were older
than she. The next year she moved
with her father to Ford City, which
was just being settled at that time.
Since then in her continued associa-
tion with Ford City schools, she has
watched the town grow; and she has
become one of the most prominent
citizens in Armstrong county. For

has been head of the history depart-
ment in Ford City High School. Sum-
marizing her experience, Mrs. «Ham-
mond says, “I’m teaching the third
generation in my classes.”

Mrs. Hammond began her studies
at Pitt in 1925.. Before she was
allowed to take college courses she
had to work off her high school re-
quirements, because the University

did not accept all her credits from

the _ Soldiers Orphans Schools of
Pennsylvania at Jumonville, Fayette
county, and from the West Chester
State Normal School.

With the exception of one sum-
mer, all Mrs. Hammond’s college
work was completed at Pitt on Sat-
urdays and during summer sessions.
In 1923, when Mrs. Hammond was
in Utah keeping house for her son,
she won a scholarship in a competi-
tive essay contest for a summer
course-at the University of Utah.

To the exercises on February 28
will come prominent business men

Another California alumnus who
did a lot to make the football boys
feel at home durin the Tournament
of. Roses trip has een heard from.
A letter comes from Lawrence A-
Williams, Law '12, in which he com-
mends the boys for their ﬁne de-~
portment and tells how the alumni
appreciated the chance to show them
a good time.

Williams is associahd with the
National City Company, of Califor-
nia, 513 West Sixth street, Los An-
geles. He was one of the alumni
who was with the boys during their
trip through the movie studios, and
who saw that the “open sesame”
sign was always in evidence.

Another letter comes from Charles
F. De Long, alumnus, who is pro-
prietor of the Mayﬂower Hotel and
“Bull Penn Inn,” ﬁiopular Los An-
geles restaurant. r. De Long gave
the party a big feed the night after
the game, which was enjoyed by
everyone, especially lﬁillback “Dick"

Richmond, Va.
Gentlemen:

I have always wanted to smoke a
pipe. After several attempts I gave
my “taate" up. for with each trial I
got a blietered ton e.

One evening, w en looking over a
certain outdoor magazine, I read that
a certain ﬁsherman could catch more
fish when usin " dgewarth," so I
decided I woul try ' his" tobacco--I
for I am no goat ﬁsherman! ' _

The next ay I tried to secure Edge-
worth. The local coun storekee
did not have it, so I sent y a frien to
the city for my first Edgeworth. Two
things have he pened: I still smoke
Edgeworth, an the local storekeeper
always has a supply. .

I catch fish and never get “a bits".
from Edgeworth!

Yours for keeps,

' Med. '97--We have received a co y .

udents who ,

schools. Many of these authorities
are former students of Mrs. Ham-
mond. . Mrs. Hammond is quite
proud ofher coming graduation and
“B. A.’’; she has even ordered ,a
ljitt ring. She states, “I want a
ring and everything that goes with
graduation.”

Mrs. Hammond has already regis-
tered for graduate work, for she

“ﬁrmly believes that every holder. of .

a bachelor’s degree should acquire

M. A. from Pitt", too.

1 Although her beginning courses at
the University were with students
young enough to be her grandchil-
dren, Mrs. Hammond says she al-
ways received the utmost courtesy
from everyone. Of her college ca-

.l'ee_r -she states:

“My University ex 'ence has
been most delightful, even though I
could attend only Saturday and sum-
mer sessio I havegonly Saturday
and summe sessions. I have dis-
covered that the University is more
tlianijust a seat of learning where
the greatest possible amount of
knowledge must be obtained at a
deﬁnite daily rate.
world in itself where a student finds
his level, just as later he ﬁnds it
in‘ his struggle for a livelihood, or
is shoved back by his competitors;
that what his fellow classmates
think of him is a measure of his
success or failure, just as much as

his standing with deanand faculty; ‘

and that the verdict of the under.-
graduates is very likely to be, later,
the verdict of his associates in the
business or social world.

“Higher standards of ‘c-irher edu-

. cation as an objective is obvious in

every course at Pitt. The spirit of
helpfulness is pervasive. A mature
student lacking the early prepara-
tion of the average youth of today
is courtesously and sympathetically
aided fin satisfying requirements,
without in the least lessening the
standards set by the authorities.
“With the ever increasing stand-
ards for secondary education and

_ the-demands of business. university

training is imperative. Personally,
it has -been of inc.‘-ilculable value; for

, perience, it _has shown me how little

I1 really know, and the association
with other and younger students
has given me the.viewpoint of the
younger generc‘ion. ’

' “People have considered me rather
foolish for goinrr. on with my educa-
tion as I have.” remarked Mrs. Ham-
mond, “but I would be lost with-
out it.”. _ ‘ _ V ’

Many times the school board has
told her that the me‘~*‘~*rs didn’t" re-
quire her to study for a deccree since
she’ has so many years of practical»

I experience’. Ful'tll’:‘l‘lll0“' Mrs. Ham-

tnond takes great pride in that she
has been an inspiration to one of
her" former students, a graduate of
Pitt, new teaching with Mrs. Ham-
mond and worlxingz for a master’s at
this University. .

_ “If she had not had to teach, ‘Mrs.
Hammoinul says, ‘she wouldh-ave still_
gone aheadj‘wEth..3heri education and,
she believes that all women should‘,
do likewise. “No woman,” she says,:
‘«‘can,afl’ord to let herself slide:.edu-
cationally; and "certainly, ll.0‘.\VOl‘l’13.'l,
if she has children, can alford not to

more active, they would have better

h'ea1th.”‘ And Mrs. Hammond prac-
tices what she preaches. 1
While her son, Lt. James W.

Hammond, Dent. '15, was attending
Pitt dental school, Mrs. ‘Hammond
She says,
“I know I could have passed all his
exams except,‘maybe, those in ad-
vanced chemistry.”

Lieut. Hammond, too, has thought
his mother rather foolish.» although.
he is very proud of the “finest
woman and mother ever.” Mrs.

Hammond remarked, “We often send .

radiograms to eachother; and just
now I am wondering what I shall
do with‘ the ﬁve hundred dollar
check he sent me_.”

After his graduation, James Ham-
mond practiced dentistry in Ford
City. In 1917 he enlisted in the air
service, and transferred to the regu-

a first lieutenant, stationed as pilot
and observer at Camp Nichols, Ma-
nila, Philippine Islands. ‘
“Almost the best thing she's ever
done,” in the opinion of Mrs. Ham-
mond is directing her history club
in the publishing of Community
Annals: Celebrating the Fortieth
Anniversary of the Founding of Ford
, Speaking of the manner in
which the booklet was published,
Mrs. Hammond says she made each
group of her history club responsi-
ble for gathering 2.7 J writing up the
data. To ﬁnance the cost, a basket-
ball game was arranged between
the varsity and faculty teams. In
addition, Mrs. Hammond personally
coached plays to obtain more‘funds.
Through similar means, half the
cost of the book was’ paid ‘before

in twenty days after‘ the book came
ioﬂ" the press. 0
Community Annals has received
favorable comment from the Penn-
sylvania, a School Journal, the His-
torical Outlook, and such educators
as W. G. Kemmel, supervisor "of. the
State Department of Education at

about 3,200 persons, about one thousand more were

In looking back at last week's game, the 
inside and the bedlals outside, one point stands out
above even the realization once again presented that
the team that plays best most steadily‘ dose not al-

Built to accomodatoless than 4,000 persons, its ca-'

would prove toosmall is not a new revelation. but-has

the process of one’s- deve1\opmen.t,»it_is ridiculous" to be;
governed by a childhood “bash1'uIness.’? A heart-to-
heart talk with a_» teacher, or an administrative’ officer,
in which the student explains his obstacles and presents
himself openly, will give the more experienced“ an
insight into his “conﬁdee’s" capabilities and enable him
to bring out the best that is either hidden or dormant
in the serious student. I

PERHAPS the greatest‘ single problem facing the

student of American history is that of comparing
Ltlle greatness of ‘Washington with that of Lincoln, and
vice’ versa. It is to aid and abet the--solving‘ of the
problem that this editorial is written.

Now we at the University of Pittsburgh would fail:
cast our ballot for Washington. In‘ spite of the fact
that some of our later day historians have derogatorily
called him “a gentleman, a scholar. a judge ‘if good
liquor;” taking into consideration neither his general-
ship nor his statcsmanship; going counter to the belief
that he was a , ‘poor speculator while Lincoln was
inst simply poo" , Istill remaiustbat he was the better
man. Hehasstoodthe teetoftlme.

Of the present campus buildings,»
State Hall is the oldest. It was
erected in 1908 for ‘the urpose _of
housing the School of ines, but

ﬁces, and the schools of Business
Administration and Education. Thaw
Hall, builtjor the school of En ‘n-
eering,“ was erected in 1909. In 910
Trees’ Gymnasium was built, the_
gift of Joseph Clifton Trees, W. U.
P. ’95, and now a trustee of the Uni-
versity. The school of Medicine ‘was
constructed in 1911 and that of
Dentistry‘ in 1912. J Mellon Insti-
tute was the next building. on the
campus, being built in 1914, the gift
of A. W. and R. B. Mellon. Dur-
ing. the_ period of. the war . it was,
found necessary to" construct the
several wooden buildings, Art’s Hall,
Biology. Hall, and the others-‘that‘.are
now part of the regular equipment.
Alumni Hall,- erected. by the sub-
scription of hundreds of alumni of

buildings, ‘having been built since
the close of the war.

achievement during the present pe-

Sinks Basket As Gun Sounds
to End Most Thrilling
Game of Season

ALLEGHENY PROVES EASY

 

Thrills and suspense were the
features of the game between the
Golden Panthers and the Fighting

Irish of South Bend, Ind., which
the locals won by the score of 24
to 22. It was the eatest game
of the present basket all season so
far as the Pitt followers are con-
cerned.

Pitt won the game through its
ability at shooting fouls, coupled
with the timely shots of Charley
Hyatt. The locals were completely
out-played by the ﬁne offensive and
defensive game of-Notre Dame, as
shown by the small number of bas-
kets Carlson's charges were able to
loop. Hyatt, playing the role of
Frank Merriwell, speared three two-
pointers while Captain Reed ac-
counted for the other basket.

Had Notre Dame played a clean-
er game, they would have romped
away with a well-earned victory.
Crows, forward, and Hamilton, cen-
ter, were booted from the Catho-
lic’s lineup because of an over-
abundant supply of personal fouls.
The Irish were guilty of a total of
22 fouls of which the Panthers took
advantage of 16. Notre ame had
10 chances and made six of them.

It was an uphill battle from the
very opening whistle. The Pan-
thers never had the lead, although
they were able to tie the score at
4. to 4, and eventually win the
game in the ﬁnal moments of the
game. Close guarding by both teams
made ﬁeld goal spearing almost im-
possible.

_.€harley Hyatt won the game,
when with the score tied at 22 all
he roped the winning counter as‘ the
blank bulIet._ careened liarnilessly
oil’, the court-ﬂoor. ' 

At the half-time,. Notre Dame
was leading by a 16-8 score. _ Six
ﬁeld als and three fou1s.conipos_ed
the igliting . Irish pointers. Pitt
accounted fora single ﬁeld goal and
a half a dozen fouls. ‘ 

It was late in the second stanza
that Pitt ﬁnally: got organized. The
Fighting Goldens made every one of
their ten fouls count in this pen-
od. Four minutes were left, and
the Carlsonites were leading. Hy-
att was nailed‘ for pushing Moyni-
han, sub for Captain Jack yin, and
this boy slipped through ‘the net to
ti: the count. Notre Dame got the
tip-off, butmissed two long shots.
Zehfuss recovered the‘ ball on the
second try and passed to Hyatt who
put the pigskin through the loop
to end the game.

I Allegheny Easy

Last Wednesday, Coach Carlson
and his troup of sterling basketeers
ran up Number 14’ at the expense
of’ llegheny College, by the score.
of 56 to 32 at the Stadium Alleys.
The game was an exact replica of
the. .past thirteen encounters. A
continual barrage of shots by the

locals put the Meadvillites to rout.

Tlte score"at the _end of the half
was 30 to_13‘. .

Captain Reed was the highscorer
of the evening, looping seven‘ bas-
kets and three fouls for a total of
17 points. Nesbitt, elongated cen-
ter, was the outstanding player for

the visitors, accounting for_ seven
baskets and a complementary
throw.

Panthers Clad,
Irishmen Mad

“We were lucky to beat Notre
Dame, I don't give a darn whatethey
say,” gasped Jerry Wunderlich, star
Panther center, -between breaths
immediately following the Pitt-
Notre Dame game last Saturday
night. “ " .

Stash Wrobleski did not ive
Dame Luck so much credit, saying,
“Well, it was .a ton h old battle and
the Irish had the e ge on us for the

most part so far aspoints go. How- :

ever, it is not the ﬁrst time we have
pulled one from the fire: North-’
western led us by ﬁfteen points at
one time.” V - .
Captain Reed interrupted, “Those
fellows had us ‘worried in the first
half but I think we found ourselves"
in;-the second period. That basket
of .Charlie’s came just in time.”- .

_ Hyatt was too thrilled to say‘
muc

- however, remarked that

while the‘ boys were in the
dressing room after the ame.

ing the winning basket, was ‘perfect.
' Iishers Comment

On the other hand, the Notre-

Dame fellows were far from satis-
ﬁed with the outcome‘ of. the game.
While they were waiting in the P.
& L. E. depot to leave for South
Bend following the game, they were
approached. ,

Hamilton, Irish center, branded
the game as a weird game, “We
outplayed the Pitt team and got the
bad end of some terrible officiating.
I must admit that Hyatt is a mighty
good player and was easily the best
man on the ﬂoor.”

Moynehan, who replaced Hamilton
when the latter was -ejected for four
personals, also had a few words to

- say. When Hamiltonwas put out

claimed ‘'1 think we complete y out-
played Pitt but must give them
credit for the ﬁghting spirit they
showed in the closing minutes of the
game. We were primed for the Pitt
game and were out to win it.”

Coach Keogan was actually peeved
over what he called the darn poor-
est ofﬁciating he has ever seen.
“Beggs Snyder refereed the rotten-
est game I have seen handled this
year. On those out of bounds plays
in the last few minutes of the game,
he sure was poor.”

Williams Explains
Pitt-Irish Sellout

Unfortunately, many stu-
dents and friends of the Uni-
versity who wished to see
the Pitt-Notre Dame basket-
ball game were‘ unable to do
so because. of the limited
seating capacity of the pa-
vilion.

The pavilion comfortably
accommodates 3,200 people.
Several days before the game

_it was announced that the
. doors‘ would be opened at
6:30 p. in. One side of the
- floor was reserved for the
students and approximately
2,000’ attended the game. _

We: regret that we could '
not take care of everyone but
if some students were una-
ble to gain admittance many
more outsiders were turned
away.‘ Under the circum-
stances, we feel that the stu-
dents were taken care of in
good shape.

Trounce Wooster
up ,2 and Notre. Dame

Leaving Pittsburgh Friday morn-
ing, -February 17, and arriving‘ at
Wooster, Ohio, a Friday night, ‘the
University of Pittsburgh’s unde-
feated swimming team started a suc-
cessful Western trip by defeating
Woostt College,~.45-2'3- Al Mango
of Pitt set a new record in the 10 -
yard back-‘stroke. with the time of
1:08. 3-10. Captain William Wright
starred -in this .me.et. by capturing
two first places and ‘swimming
anchor man on the. ‘winning relay
team. Pitt’s tankmen completely
outclassed the aggregation re-
sented by Wooster and Pat or:
looked with pride upon his stellar
mermen. - ' -

.Fr.om Wooster the team invaded
the middle-west-, . to meet Notre
Dame, the outstandin tankmen of
their section», and su merged the
Irish mermen to the tune of 45-23.
Notre Dame was only able to’ take
two ﬁrst places during the entire
meet, held in En an natatorium,
these being the 4 0-yard and fancy
divin events. Captain William
Wrig t again came into the glitter
of the calcium by duplicating his
record. at.Wooster, winnin “ the 40-
yard free-style in 19:2, an the 100-
yard free-style in 1:01.4. _.

By-defeatin Notre Dame, the
best of the mi dle-west, and trounc-
ing Army, rated as the cream of the
East, and proving far superior to
any local competition thus far
presented, the followers of Pitt can
easily boast of another undefeated
athletic. team. ,

Pitt meets. Wooster this Friday
evening at Trees pool, and Alle-
gheny and Westminster in the very
near future. Later the itineryg of
the Pitt natators will be. taken to
the inter-collegiates, according to

fact that Pitt topped Northwestern
and they in turn lost to the Pan-
thers. He also could not explain

Pitt and Tech kept in harmony
with the dripping weather outside
last night by staging a deluge of
baskets at the Carnegie gymnasium,
the Panthers winning by a 59-38
score in the ﬁnal and most interest-
ing of the three-game series. It
marked a clean sweep for the victors
as well as their sixteenth straight
triumph.

From start to ﬁnish the two clubs
played strictly on the offense, with
the Carlson team again reaching a
dizzy total and the Plaid scoring a
moral victory by almost hitting the
40 mark, a sensational achievement
for this year's tattered Tartans.

Who Said “Slump”

Fans who believed the Pitt boys
were in a slump‘ may quiet their
fears. After the Notre Dame debacle
the word was passed around that the
locals were too conﬁdent and disaster
loomed in the remaining battles.
-Last night ended such stuff quickly.
With substitutes in there a good part
of the time the steam roller piled up
a neat total of 24 ﬁeld goals and
every player of the nine entered by
Carlson scored with the exception of
McMahan.

.The sensational Pitt offensive
worked to perfection despite the

the Skibos during the series. With
Fisher in the lineup in order to give
diminutive Paul Zehfuss a well
earned rest, Wrobleski was shoved
up to a forwardiposition at the out-
set. This failed to hamper the Pan-
thers to any extent so that they held
a big 31-17 margin at half time.

Tartans in Lead

Captain White put the home club
off to a rousing start b tossing in
a-"perfect shot from mi door a mo-
ment after the ﬁrst whistle. He
added a foul point before the Blue
and Gold got its. bearings. A neat
basket close up by Reed and a two-
pointer bywrobleski shoved the Pitt
ea;m'out_ front, but Hitchcock caged
a beau-ty,-‘to-bring‘the. count to 5-4

in. favor of the Tai-tans.
At this point Charley Hyatt got
-started-on his evening's usual sen-

1927.28 athletic Tea...

With only six basketball games
remaining on the Blue and Gold
ﬂdor’ card, the fall-winter athletic‘
year’ of 1927-28, one -of the. most
successful ever conducted at this 
i s
end.’ The football, basketbal and
swimming camps’ ‘s all stand out

as epochal athletic efforts onthe

part of Golden gridders, ﬂoormen
and natators. _

Last Saturday night two—Panther
teams sailed thifou h their biggest
tests of their sche ule when the
cagers and swimmers scored a dou-
ble victory over the famed Irish of
Notre Dame. The natators swam

their way- to victory in the Notre

Damepool at South Bend, Ind.
Coach Sutherland
Alt]-iou h the football season has
£_aded_in the background it. is
leasing to recall that the ‘Golden
anthers» of the‘ gridiron did not
lose one of‘ their nine regularly
sceduled games _and were one of the
most fearedteams in the country.
Commentin ‘ on the successful at_h-
letic .-year einsg enjoyed by P1317
tea“ms,_ Coach utherland stated, I
have never seen it fail that a good
football season has not brought on
a. good season, for the other ath-
letic teams at the university. Foot-
ball. -ﬁlls the men with that true
ﬁghting spirit and also arouses the
interest of the students _to such a
high itch that it is carried over to
the 0 er sports. that follow the suc-
cessful football season.”
“The success of our past football
team was due .mainly to the

s irit of the fellows which eiia ed ’

t em to co-operate and work to eth-
er. They’ battled through a ard
schedule and came out with a good
record because of that fighting
spirit within them that always spur-
red them on _to win. .

~“In-- regards to the basketball

team, I have -seen several of the

basketball games at the stadium and
must say that we have a’ truly re-
markable ﬂoor team. The same co-
operation _and unity that was found
in‘ the football team is present in
the basketball team. I think they
will 0 through the season unde-
feate if they keep up their pres-
ent pace.

“I am not particularly inter-
ested in swimming, but hear that
Coach Corr has a mighty good
team. He is a real coach and
knows of what he teaches. The wide

margin of the victories -scored ‘over

—Arxny» and Carrie ie and the wins

owner .-Wooster an . Notre» -Dame,
speak’ well for a. championship
swimming team also."

" Coach Corr V

‘Coach Corr of the crack Pan-
ther swimming team, which has not
and probably will not lose a meet
this year, is loud in praise of his
men and‘ regards the; present. ath-
letic era oneofthe greatest in the
history of the university. He says,
“I missed only one football game,
the one at Des >Moines, and I think
Coach Sutherland had a practically
unbeatabla team.” As far as our
wonderful basketball team, I could
sit and watch that team play
every night in — the week and still
not have too much basketball. It is
undoubtedly the best basketball
team I have ever seen.

slleferring to his natators, Pat
claimed, “I have coached Panther
swimming teams since 1923 and can
say that the team this year is the
best tank team in the history of the
school. Captain Wright is an in-
comparable swimmer and will rob-
ably again be. awarded the any
Quig Taylor Memorial Tro by at
the close of the season. He liaswon
this award, given to th_e best all-'
around member of the team, for the
past_ two‘ years and is_ now lead-
ing in points__toward the trophy.

“Wooster is the only remaining‘
team that -has a chance to u "set
the Panther swimmers, but I ink
the boys will again beat them to
keep their slate for the season

d clean,” concluded Coach Corr.

Coach Carlson of the undefeated
Golden cagers commented " on Pitt
athletics, “that win .over Notre
Dame Saturday night assures ‘us of
an unusually successful basketball

season. I think my bo s outplayed

the Irish in thesecond‘ alt to make
up _f_or their slow start" in the ﬁrst
period. iV_Ve shotthe same"numb€1_'
33$ fouls in the first half in which

otre Dame led, as we did in the
final half. From now on things
don’t look so tough. ' _ L
. 5:1 am glad to hear that our
swimming team is also meetingwith
much success, also beating the Irish
Saturday night." The fame ined
by our football "team coupl with
th_e records of the court and tank
teams place this period of Pitt ath-
letic history on a mighty high plane
which will stand as a mark for fu-

ture teams to shoot at.”

RIFLERS LOSE TO
NITTANY LIONS BY
FIVE-POINT: MARGIN

“Although the Panther riders shot
one of the highest scores of the sea-
son, the Nittsny Lions nosed them
out of a victory by a mei five points
in last week's shoot. Coach Harter’s
boys shot more consistently in this
match than they have since the start
of the season. The defeat, however,
does not seriously hinder the position
in league shooting as they’re still in
the upper third. Penn State holds
first place in the league at present.

Homer brought down first place
by shooting a total of 284, while Mc-
Kinney stepped into Captain Hinder-
er’s customary berth of second place
with the score of 268. Hinderer fol-
lowed with a.264. Riddle and Whit-
ney closed the scoring with Riddle
ﬁring 262 and Whitney 261.

States lost to  State.

Spring Grid Drills

According to Coach Jock
Sutherland spring football
trainin will start the latter
part 0 next month. Jock
states, “We plan to make this
training period count a great
deal for we are facing one of
the most diﬁlcult schedules in
years. Meeting such teams
as Tech, Syracuse, Wash-
Jeﬂ, Nebraska and State
without a chance for a letup
will test the team to the
limit. We willhave a een
team and I haven't yet ound
a man to take the place of
Gibby Welch to reel oil’ 50 or
60 yards at a. time. It will
take a great deal of develop-
ment and training to turn
out _a good team.”
