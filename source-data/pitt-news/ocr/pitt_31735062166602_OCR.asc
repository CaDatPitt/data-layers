iMora_1s-Sex Equation

i"‘In ‘Moral Revolution’ i

by ANNE DORN
At an informal symposium on
the new morality, Monday, An-
’ son Mount, senior editor of Play-
boy Magazine, reviewed the
“moral revolution.” The word
“moral doesn’t mean the same
thing as sex,” stated Mount.
“Moral applies to other things
more signiﬁcant.
“But morals have come to re-

fer to sex, so the new morality ,

has -to be taught on that basis.
Studies have shown that people
3‘-.;)aren’t behaving any differently.
' “ The attitude of what we're do-
ing is changing, but not what

we do.” .
Mount explained that the “rev-
olution” came about when Bish-
op Robinson from England Wrote

a treatise containing a chapter"

called ‘-‘The New Morality.” The
Bishop stated that “dogmatic
legalism and supernaturalism
don't belong in Christianity and
distort Christ’s teachings,.and
that acts are immoral only if
they hurt someone.” 

Mount added that the “odds

, seem high, but many people

agree with him. He stated the
V _ basic concept of relativity. The
 church has always practiced this
relativity. For example, it says,
‘Thou shalt not kill, except in
war and self-defense.’ But in the
case of sex, it has always prac-
ticed dogmatism.
“A new attitude and new lib-
eralism have been brought on
‘by changing traditions. Man-
kind is no longer willing to ac-
cept rules with no exception.
It doesn’t help to obey if the
rules cause more harm than
good]: .
Mount stressed 2. “profound
-. generation split” that -is ‘going
" beyond the ordinary split. “No
generation is so different ,,as- to-
day's. It has grown up in an
era of plenty, and its basic
need to make a living isn't so
important. Its interests are more
idealistic. The sex revolution is
part of social revolution in all
areas. This generation’s basic
values are entirely different.”
He pointed out that “organ-
ized religion is losing young
people since. the last ten or 15
years. Yet at the same time, a
?,»- growth of interest in theology
and ethics by those same young
people. The real idealists join
the Peace Corps.”

In relating Playboy with the
moral revolution, Mount stated
that the magazine has been tag-
ged the spokesman for the
younger generation. “Heffner is
often considered the high priest
of secularism. We ob-ject to or-
ganized religion when its places
dogma ahead of the people.”

Mount explained that the
church has forbidden certain
areas in which it has taken jus-
tified stands. If its stands are
destroyed by modern science or
modern thought, it preaches a
guilty conscience. “People just
 _aren’t as guilty about things as
?-‘ffthey used to be.”

 

 
  

.‘‘I can’t believe a set ,of.laws,

  

one else. It's a case of situation
ethics.”

In response to Mo.unt’s discus-
sion, Dr. Charles Carson, direc-
tor of the Lutheran Student
Foundation, stated a “fundamen-
tal reaction to Heffner.” He em-
phasized that “many people think
the answer to ‘Don’t’ is ‘Do.’
Young people are looking for
someone to say ‘Do.’’’ He be-

lieved that the Playboy philo- '

sophy of hedonism is not new
and has “been around” for a
long time.

“Pleasure is a self-fulﬁling
thing,” he stated. “The Playboy
attitude encourages a ‘me-above
all’ natural drive and reinforces
it.” He blamed Playboy with an
“insufficiently tragic view of hu-
man nature,” and added that
“even the history of mankind
doesn’t disclose an answer to the
morals question.” Mount admit-
ted the weakness in the Playboy
philosophy if it is taken in the
wrong way, but noted that “we
really preach responsibility for
mature people.”

.Also speaking at the symposi-
um was Dr. Richard L. Ruben-
stein, Charles E. Merrill Lec-
turer in French Humanities and
director of the B’nai B’rith Hill-
el Foundation. He deﬁned as
morally dangerous “people who
don't know what they’re getting
,out of life.” He stated that a
person who drifts from one im-
moral relations to another is a
“human being in search of good
relationships.” He concluded that
“all pleasures are calculated to
loss and gain.”

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Highlight Union Renovation-I

by DAN BOOKER

Plans for extensive reno-
vation of the main ﬂoor of
the Pitt Union have been an-
nounced by Union Director
John Loch. Speciﬁcs of the
remodeling including reloca-
tion of the main desk, estab-
lishment of “study—brows-
ing” and recreation areas,
repainting of the interior of the
building, complete refurn-ishing,
and extensive carpeting.

Work on the project will be
completed in late February.
Loch noted that most of the
work was to have been done

‘when students returned at the

beginning of this term. But a
carpenters strike and the prob-.
lems of working with an old
building, like ﬁnding gas instead
of electrical conduits for light-
ing, held up the project, said
Loch. ,

Probably the ﬁrst area to be
completed will be the Marble
Lounge. As on the rest of the

ﬂoor, new lighting will be in- °

stalled. Carpeting will cover the
space now tiled in black and
white as well as the “stairway
to nowhere”'which will be used
as an art gallery.

The Union Information Cen-
ter will also be-moved to this
‘area. This desk will ..perform’
the same functions as present-
ly but will also dispense equip-
ment for pool and small games.

Six pool tables will be placed
in the large lower lounge, along,
with six to eight games tables.
Padded bench seating will rim
the area. Loch predicted that

this particular facility would be .

for the Winter term.

Most of the planning for the
project has been done‘ by Paul
Plannert of Plannert Design As-
sociates. Loch explained that
Plannert was called in to study
how the area could be used most
effectively. Once this was done,
Loch and other administrators
got together with students Ken
Frederick, Student Government
president, and Jeff Zdrale, Stu-
dent Union Board public rela-
tions‘ chairman. "

“In this meeting, we agreed on
concepts—to have an art gallery,
a study area, a recreation area,”
said Loch. “From i there, the
Plannert people went on to such
things as color -schemes and
furnishings.” ‘

Other aspects of the remodel-
ing include:

> A TV Lounge with carpeted
bleacher seating. Loch remarked
that the room could accommo-
date from 60-85 people for watch-
ing television or for meetings.
This lounge will open only into
the lower lounge through pre-

sent glass doors. Removal of the

old candy and magazine desk
will allow for the room, which

ii Saturday, the Student
[3.Union began this 'Yea1"S

la program featuring Nipsy
Russell and the Rooftop Sing-
.;e'rs., I had never been ex-
tremely impressed with Nipsy
“Russell before the concert. He
-was "just another television per-
gsonality who you -might occa-
-‘sionially see on a quiz program
_ or-“ya:-ielty show. But in a day
‘when Negro’ comedians are the
""in" thing, Russell very cleverly
-held¢his own. "
 His comic style is mildly sar-
-_ castic, covering anything from
 “the Mid-East war—the Israelis
exlhibited Egypt and Jordan at
..their Expo pavillion”—to “the
football team — ‘the Christians
0 "had a better chance against the
I lions.” His witty comments did-
r.’t fail to cover such topics as
A"-love—the difference between
rape and romance is salesman
4 j ship,” or such social programs
0. as ,"Medioare——we now can en-
"fjoy diseases that we could never
afford before.”

His comments on the racial
situation, although very limited,
 were subtle and strong—if the
Jwlhite people can spend their
money on Coppertone, the least
 the black people can do is meet
V them half way by using “Yel-
IOW FGIIOWJ”
, After his monologue, Russell
-performed a series of dances,
. covering most of the dance
craze or the past few years. Al-
though he is no Fred Astaire,
"Russell proved his dancing abil-
7_ ity by doing such steps as the
Bosa Nova, Twist, Slop, Frug,
‘ and’ even the Charleston. His
0 "dancing was more of ‘a demon-
VJs_trat'lon than a strict perform-
ance, for those people in the au-
_' dience that were still members
of the wallﬂower set.

   
   
  
   
   
  
  
   
 
   
 
  
    
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
  
     
   
  
   
   
   
  
   
   
 
   
   
  
   
  
   
    
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
   
   
  
  
    
   
   

What appealed to me most
.'Blb'0.l1t Nipsy Russell was the
close rapport he established with
his audience. For instance, he
"walked on stage wearing a Pitt
Sweatshirt and armored him-
:self ‘with one of our beloved
pennants. He insisted on explain-

ing some of his preceding ma-
terial to a group of people who
walked in late. He even had
special words for those in the
audience who might be on aca-
demic probation—if the Univer-
sity was able to make Penicillin
out of moldy cheese, it can
surely make something out of
you. 

And then at the end of his
performance, sweat streaming
from’ his brow, he to-ldvthe audi-
ence to study hard, for the one
great power is knowledge. Or-
dinarily such a statement would
be corny, but with his perform-
ance behind him, and the sincer-
ity in which it was spoken, it
meant a great deal. Nipsy Rus-
sell is a very funny man, and a
true performer with style, grace,
and polish.

Saturday's concert also fea-
tured the Rooftop Singers. Best
known for their hit song of a
few years ago, “vllalk Right In,”
the group displayed some ﬁne
example of harmony and blend-

’ ing in such songs as “You Don’t

Know,”V “Side by Side,” and, of
course, “Walk Right In.” For

the most part, however, their

choice of material was unfortu-

nate. For example, the group
sang such worn out renditions
as ‘,‘I’ve Been ‘Working on the
Railroad” and “Bull Frog.”

The Rooftop Singers is a very
polished group, and their only
downfall, if any, is their brand
of music. Folk music, in the
Kingston Trio vain, is a_ dying
popular music trend. This can
be seen most clearly by the re-
cen=t break up of the Kingston
Trio because of poor record sales
and diminishing concert audi-
ences, and by the new “folk
rock” styles of such groups as
the Byrds and Simon and Gar-
funkle.

The Rooftop Singers did sing
one song in the tradition po-p
idiom~ that won a very favor-
able response. This number,
“Falling in Love All by Myself,”
should point the way to the
group's future performances.
Unless they switch from the
waning folk media, or at least
spark up its performances with
a little bit of originality, as in
the case of the Back Porch Ma-
jority who won a very favor-
able response last year, the Roof
Top Singers, like its music, is
doomed.

The University has run into
opposition concerning its Plan
to transfer bodies from the Oak-
land Cemetery. More than 5,000
bodies will-have to be moved be-
fore the proposed new dormi-
tories can be erected on the Site
near the Field House.

The problem is not about mov-
ing the bodies, but about where
to move them and who’s going
to pay for it. The University
and a local church plan to move
the bodies to a special section
in Mt. Royal Cemetery, Glen-
shaw. The First Trinity Evan-
gelic Lutheran Church is pre-
pared to add $44,870 to the Uni-
versity’s $110,000 for upkeep at
Mt. Royal.

Two weeks ago, nearly 150

persons appeared in a hearing
at Common Pleas Court to pro-
test the transfer. They do not
want the remains of their rela-
tives moved to the Mt. Royal
site. Instead they. would move
the bodies to sites of their own
preference and have the Univer-
sity pay for the transfer and up-
keep. The University’s position

is that it will allow the bodies ’

to be moved anywhere, but it

Attorney William H. Markus
presented the orignal petition
to move the bodies to Judge
Ralph H. Smith, Jr. Judge Smith
met with Markus and the attor-
ney for the protesting relatives
of the deceased at a second-hear

ing last Thursday. Mr. Markus
said that this hearing, was pri-
marily an argument between at

 
   
   
  
  
    
    
    
   
 

torneys to determine exactly
wha.-,'the law allowed. He said,  I

“The law requires only that the
bodies be moved to a suitable
site.” The University considers
Mt. Royal -suitable site -and will
not be concerned with the cost
of moving the bodies elsewhere.

The matter is nowrin Judge
Smith’s h-ands. He has heard the
attorneys’ arguments on What
the law allows._ He will now
have to decide the case on a
strictly legal basis. The Mt. Roy-

al site is suitable to most peo- '

ple involved. But will the Uni-
versity be required to pay for

the transfer of the bodies to’*'"

other suitabel sites?
Judge Smith will hand down
an order when he decides. But

as Mr. Markus said, no one

knows exactly when this will be.

The 1,420 tombstones and 5,-
034 bodies will deﬁnitely be mov-
ed. But the transfer may cost
the University more than the
$115 million they had originally
expected to pay.

The current controversy that has arisen over the operations of

 the Pitt Union reaffirms the imperative need for clarifying the key issues

in this matter. ‘ _
The latest edition of the University’s Student Handbook contains

the followincr quote: “The Pitt Union was founded on the philosophy that

it i ‘the Union should serve as a laboratory of student management and self-

directed social and cultural activity.”’ There is obviously a serious ques-
tion as to the validity of that statement, as Indicated by the passage of

A 1 the Senate “Omnibus Bill Concerning the Student Union” last Thursday.

The senators almost unanimously agreed that the current Student
Union does not fulfill in effect what its purports to do as stated in the

it Student Handbook. We, too, feel that if the Pitt Union “should serve as

a laboratory of student management,” students .should be included in the
planning stages in areas where they have no control, allowing them to
contribute in an exchange of ideas to a more effective Student Union.

We reiterate that an essential step in airing the students’ griev-
ances would be a committee composed of students, faculty members, and
administrators to investigate not only the charges in the Senate bill, but

 

S-Toward Cooperativ

e Action

other areas of complaint, such as the handling of the .ID cards and res-
ervations. 'I‘he work done on this committee could serve as’ a guideline
for the proposed new Student Union, as the committee would formulate
criteria for a Student Union that would more eff€CtiV€1Y S€1'V€ the Students-

Student Governmen_t’s bill reaffirmed that students are d1ssattis-
ﬁed with the status quo. The next step is to deﬁne what the areas of

complaint are and to devise a way to rectify the current situation.

As we will not have our new Student Union for several years, it
is imperative that students be included on a planning C0mm'itte9 to make
our current building more adaptable to our students’ needs. Obviously,
we are limited in office space, but there must be a better attempt to ac-
commodate the needs of our student actiViti€S, 01‘ OW‘ organizations will
be unable to perform their functions.

Just as students, faculty members, and administrators worked side
by side to ﬁnd a solution to problems raised on the Commlttee t0 R€V1eW
Book Center Policy, once again we urge Chancellor Posvar to allow these
three arms to work together. For only with the establishment of this
kind of policy committee can we develop the kind of program that W111
most effectively serve our student body. ’

“Urban Gotterdammerung

ON MONDAY, I made the
point that we have contin-
ually called upon the black
man to improve himself, to
become responsible, to car-
ry his own weight. But as
soon as it appears that he is
doing so, we decide that
maybe it wasn’t such a good
idea after all, since he usual-
ly decides to improve ‘not
only his body but his mtind
as well. And, having done so,
he recognizes how unspeak-

' ably rotten his deal has been.
-We whites don't mind the

the Negro improving him-

self as long as he keeps in

his place. »
The point of this is tha

' we aren't going to do a damn -

thing for the Negro and he
knows it. The rT.iots were

therefore a good thing for

two reasons. First of all,
they let loose emotions that
have been pent up for years,
and especially the feelings of

hopelessness and anger that
resulted from the false hopes
and promises of the early
sixties. It it noteworthy that
while major riots have now
occurred for three consecu-
tive years, never has there
been a major riot in any ‘city
on two separate years. It
seems as if the catharsis is
lasting, and if the right
things are done, perhaps per-
manent.

The second point is in a
sense an explanation of the
ﬁrst. It is interesting to no-
tice who exactly started the
riots, who did the sniping,
and who did the looting. The
blame for the riots them-
selves has been officially as-
cribed to “hoodlums,” rather
than the more “respectable”
inhabitants of the ghettoes.
Ridiculous. As information
has come out, it has been
discovered that most of the
leaders of the riots have

been the very same people
who are working in the pov-
erty programs, the integra-
tion movements, the coopera-
tives. The charges made by
many of our Senators, that
many of the people working
in the antipoverty program

‘ﬁnanced and organized the

riots are perfectly true.

IN OTHER words, it was
not the young hoodlums who
organized the riots, but the
very people who we like to
claims are the responsible

ones—-the ones who we are

supposedly encouraging!
They are the people who are
sweating in the classrooms
and meeting halls and shops
for their people, not the
hoodlums. And they are the
ones who felt it necessary to

I start the riots, and if what

I said in the ﬁrst part of this

article is true, they were

completely justiﬁed in doing
so. The reason for this is
that for the ﬁrst time, the
White man's hold on the
ghetto has been broken. It is
a shame that the only way
to do that had to be by vio-
lence, but now it is done, and
the entire country is better
off that the riots are at least
partly over, than if they had
never occurred at all. 

The Negro is now free to
develop his own institutions,
his own hierarchies, his own
ideology and his own power,
without the interference and

‘control of the white man.

It is ironic that this rev-
olution has been ascribed to
the lower class scum, rather
than the embryonic Negro
middle class, but not" with-
out precedent. It was the
common mistake of the 19th
century aristocrats, who fail-
ed to see the nationalist rev-
olution of their time as the
product of the more educated
and responsible middle class.
The lessons that are taught
to us time and again in our
history classes seem to be
ignored so easily. The fact
that the Negro has advanced
to the point that he will re-
volt is, in fact, the most per-
suasive proof of his develop-
ingi maturity. The fact that
the White man has so uni-
versally misunderstood and
attacked the Negro for what

New Project Begins

Classes Open for Pre - Schoolers

The University, Pittsburgh
Public Schools, and the Gen-
eral Learning Corporation
have jointly created the Pri-
mary Education Project, a
program designed to open
classes for Pittsburgh chil-
dren, ages three through
ﬁve.

The objective of the program
is to develop more effective
learning materials and teaching
techniques for young children
and will employ some of the
principles” of the Individually
Prescribed Instruction plan de-
veloped at the Oakleaf Elemen-

tary School in suburban Pitts-
iburgh. The Oakleaf experiment

is conducted by the University.

The primary Education Proj-
ect is» part of the growing move-
ment to begin the formal educa-
tion at the age of three rather

than at the kindergarten or ﬁrst-,

grade level, a concept endorsed
by President Johnson in his spe-
cial message to Congress on

Children and Youth last Feb-
ruary.

Each partner in the project
has a distinct role. The Univer-
sity, through the Learning Re-
search and Development Center
and the School of Education, is
furnishing the research and de-
velopment staff and the student
teachers. The school system is
responsible for the management
of the school and is providing
teachers and classrooms at Frick
Elementary School, where 190
pupils are enrolled in the proj-
ect’s program.

General Learning, which is
the educational affiliate of Time,
Inc., and the General Electric

Company, is contributing ﬁnan-

cial support, computer-based
handling of student records, and
staff and materials for the mak-
ing of new learning-aids.

ceded: More Players

by MIKE BROURMAN

 Pitt, the pendulum seems to be swinging. After three
years -of losing football, it looks like there is d-aylight ahead. But
the _pendulum could reverse. itself at any moment.

 ' :‘‘‘We’ve been out-programmed,” explains Panther coach Dave
 “We d-on’t have enough bodies to go around for the competi-
'.on.we face.” » ‘

 " Disturbed by the stigma that hung over big-time college foot-
’ball, a_ stigma of “football factories,” the University in 1962 joined
with-Syracuse, West Virginia, and Penn State in a restatement of
_.football recruitment policies.

j,- The major policy change was an agreement to limit the num-
berof football scholarships to 25 a year. At the time the reasoning
seemed sound, for college football was one-platoon sport in which
“large numbers of players were not necessary.

3" The motives behind the reasoning were just as sound. Too
yany schools were bringing in 50 to 60 athletes a year and then
-taking away the scholarships of those who failed to make the team.
 practice was reinforcing the searnier aspects of college foot-
ball and needed to be stopped.

.» ‘By their actions, the Eastern powers hoped to act as sort of
a Pied Piper; they would lead and the rest of the country would
follow. E

,, But, the noble experiment was doomed to failure. No one fol-
lowed the lead of the East. Georgia Tech and Texas and the others
continued to bring in massive numbers of football players.

 And then came an event which compounded the failure. The
-, NCAA voted in tlwoplatoon football despite the objection of most
of the coaches in the East. With that, Eastern football, which had
already begun to slip, soon plummeted.

i The cynic may say that 25 scholarships a year are still enough,
whether its one platoon football, two platoon football, or three
platoon football, but Dave Hart, naturally, disagrees. And his rea-
soning is -hard to fault.

Z “In two platoon football,” Hart explains, “you need 44 players
just to be ‘two deep at every position. Not three deep like most
schools, but two deep. Then, they «have to practice against someone.
“Right now we're forced to practice against ourselves. This is
i: really a bad situation because you double the chance of injury.
<:When a ﬁrst string defensive back tackles a second string fullback,
you may wind up with both of them getting hurt.”

T ‘The ideal situation, says Hart, is to have at least one full team
to practice against, a team that runs the opposition plays thus fami-
;, liarizing the regulars with them. Pitt can’t do this now with its 59
 -man squad, .a squad whose size is a result of the restricted recruit-

Injury Jinx Shelves Hutchko I

.by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor
There seems to be a jinx
on Panther football this

year.
First Dennis Ferris was ruled
out for the season because of an
eye injury. Then in summer
camp, there were so many in-
juries that Dave Hart couldn’t’
ﬁeld a team for scrimmages. And
last week, tailback Skip Orszu-
lak suffered another shoulder in-
jury. .
Now it’s sophomore Chuck
Hutchko. Hutchko, a 6-1, 195-
pounder, recently fell off a mo-
torbike and suffered an infect-
ed knee. He was the ﬁrst team
center, but he can’t play Satur-
day against UCLA.
In his place, Hart must. now

i go with soph Dave Magyar. The
munber "two center, Magyar has _

been used sparingly with the
Blue team; Magyar,‘however, is

two inches taller and 23 pounds‘-

heavier than Hutchko.
Hutchko’s injury _causes more
confusion for Hart. Before it
was just a matter of readying
his soph quarterbacks --for the
Bruins. Now his quarterbacks

ly. “They’re still blowing assign-
ments, like blocks and handoffs,”
Hart said.

“We’ll have to play superior
ball against UQLA,” he contin-
ued. “They play great football,
tl1ey’re quick, very quick. And
I don't try to con our kids. I
call it as I see it.” ~

Besides Hutchko, Orszulak may
not see action Saturday. Hart
would like to have the speedster
in the backfield, but he may not
entire season.

Mike Raklewicz, the returning

number one fullback, was moV- .

ed to Orszulak’s tailback spot. “

Moving up to the Blue team at
fullback‘ is sophomore John
White, a 6-2, 200-pounder.

At quarterback, Hart plans to
stay with Frank Gustine. Crus-
tine, a fine passer, showed poise
in the‘ team’s last scrimmage.

But Hart doesn’t want to throw ,

too often.

“If we pass 35 times, We’re
done. We’re behind if we»have
to constantly throw the ball. 1
just hope our running holds up,”
Hart said, emphasizing the hope.

Hart has already established
drillsforv the remainder of the
week.

by ROY JACOBS

Last year Eddie Gallin
played a lot of linebacker. He
didn’t start, but he played
right behind Jim Flanigan,
Terry Hoover, and Lou Par-
rott. Although not a member of
the Prowling Panther pack, in
the ﬁnal defensive statistics he
was fourth; the only current
Panther ahead of him was Joe
Curtin. But this year some peo-
ple are asking where Gallin ﬁg-

ures in the defensive plans.
G,-allin was playing corner line-
-backer until he_ injured his knee
early this fall. When he came
back he found himself behind
sophomore Jeff Brown. Then
Greg Keller, middle guard or
middle linebacker, suffered a
bruised shoulder and _Gallin was
moved to the middle. Now Kel-

ler‘s back, so where does that

leave Gallin? ‘ . .
“I’ll play a lot at middle line-
backer,” said Ed. “Keller’s

shoulder could trouble him at
any time and he'd have to sit
out the rest of the game.”

Rather than wait in the wings
for his chance, Gallin will be on
the ﬁeld this Saturday against
UCLA. _

“I think Louie and I'll prob-

ably start at the corners. We’ve i

got more experience and we’ll
be more relaxed,” he ﬁgured.
The experience’ll be necessary
against the Uclans.

“The pressure will be on every-

ble. Terry Hoover played line-
backer last’ year. He’s like a
sophomore at the position. The
other end, Paul'iNaponick, is a

Those who have watched Gal-
lin play linebacker has express-
ed some doubts as to his physi-
cal capabilities, speciﬁcally his
running speed.

“My speed isn’t really bad,”
argued Gallin, “although I do

Playboys Take Over Lead
As Dorm Softball, Continues

The dorm softball season
continued Monday with two
teams winning by impressive
scores, and one team forfeiting.
Playboy's Penthouse continued
its victorious ways ‘by crushing
Pleasure Palace, 10-3; Keystone
downed Hawthorne, 15-11, in a
loosely played game; and Bea-
con House forfeited to the House
of Lords.

The contest between the Bun-
nies and Pleasure Palace was
decided by, the strong arm of
pitcher ‘Sy Adler. Continuously,
Adler had the opposition pop-
ping up. The Playboys got solid
hitting from the entire team.

The real deciding factor of
Keystone House's victory was a
mistake - prone Hawthorne out-
ﬁeld. Numerous outﬁeld ﬂies
went between the - ﬂy chasers,
and only the superb play of
right ﬁelder Andy Urban kept

the game close. Keystone was
powered by Bob Maydark, who
had four hits including two
homers, and Dave Raver who

had three well-placed shots.
