UPMC gains clues to
AIDS development

Michael Humes

For years AIDS has been the source

of great frustration and suffering for both‘

people infected with the disease and the
researchers trying to help them.

But researchers at the Pitt medical
school have been making progress.
Signiﬁcant ﬁndings from two different
studies could prove to be integral for a
vaccine in the future.

The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
is a four-site study with locations at Pitt,
Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, and
UCLA. MACS is studying 2,000 HIV-
infected men, many of whom have seen
their status progress from HIV positive to
AIDS.’

Charles Rinaldo, Ph.D., professor of
pathology at the Pit School of Medicine

in-..,_ and director of the Pitt Men’s study —

‘Pitt’s MACS site — set up the site 10
years ago. He is joined in the study by
Phalguni Gupta, Lawrence A. Kingsley,
and Dr. John Mellors. ‘

The researchers have discovered that
the more HIV virus, or virus load, in a per-
son’s blood, the more quickly the disease
will progress to AIDS.

Despite accomplishments, school has a bad rap

.Gre9..f‘§ h

 

 

As the largest university in western
Pennsylvania, the largest employer in
Pittsburgh, and definitely occupying the
largest portion of Oakland, Pitt is con-
stantly under public scrutiny.

‘ Pitt’s research and academic pro-
grams gain international and national

attention, and opinions about the

University’s image
vary there as much
as they do in
Oakland.

Whether on an
international or A
local level, though,
Pitt’s public image and reputation con-
cerns all of us who one day hope to
hang a University of Pittsburgh diploma
on our office wall.

“Pitt has a variety of publics,” said
Ken Service, Pitt spokesman. “We have
to keep our contributions to students,
the commonwealth, and the nation in
front of people.”

Recently, a number of articles in
publications like lime magazine and the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette touting Pitt’s
achievements in areas such as medicine,
literature, and science were compiled by
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg in his
report to the University’s Senate

Council.

    

 

“I think increasingly people are
coming to realize that there is very spe-
cial work being conducted at Pitt,” said
Nordenberg in an earlier interview.

He wanted to emphasize the recent
achievements of the University, but
despite Nordenberg’s sentiments, such
accomplishments by the University
seem, at least statistically, to have little
impact on Pitt’s reputation as a national
university.

According to
U. S. News &
World Rep0rt’s
“l997 Guide to the
Best Colleges in
I — - - America,” Pitt
isn’t necessarily the academic power-
house the chancellor’s report portrays it
as.

Out of 204 national "universities
rated in the guide, Pitt was ranked as a
“second tier school,” meaning that its
ranking fell below the top 50 schools in
America. ‘

In this report, schools are ranked
according by such criteria as the types
of students it selects, percentage of fac-
ulty with doctorates, student retention
rates, and alumni donation to the school.

But recently there has beena move-
ment among listed schools asking U.S.

Rash of bike thefts prompts police warnings

plan Dr bur h

   

Each year students across the country
shell out millions of dollars for top-of-the-
line mountain bikes, relying on them for
transportation to class, and each year
thieves make millions of dollars by stealing
these same bikes.

In 1995, the most commonly commit-
ted crime in Pennsylvania was theft.
According to Pitt Police, a very large part of
that ﬁgure is bike theft.

The bike theft problem has continued .

to rise and is currently near an all—time high
at Pitt. In September, there were a reported
29 cases of bicycle or bicycle part theft.
That’s about one a day.

Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd said the
majority of these thefts could have been
prevented if the owners were more careful.

“The number one thing a bike thief is
usually looking for is an unsecured or

 

weakly-secured bike,” said Boyd. ~ , . '

DENVER — Lawyers for Terry
Nichols, who is suspected in the
Oklahoma City bombing, have
appealed plans to seek the death penal-
ty. .
Lawyers argue that Attorney

' General Janet Reno, who filed the plans

in May, ignored federal procedures and
that U.S. District _Judge Richard P.
Matsch erred when he dismissed
Nichol’s first suit which to drop Reno’s
petition. The Justice Department has
not yet filed a response to these
charges.

The appeal will go through the 10th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Nichols
and Timothy McVeigh face federal con-
spiracy charges in the April 1995
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building, which killed 168 peo-
ple and injured more than 500.

AIDS

For a long time researchers were not
able to determine why the disease would
take 10 years to progress to AIDS in some
people, yet only ﬁve years in others. This
new ﬁnding gives them the answer.

“In 1984 and 1985 the viral load of
the men in our study was measured and
we found it was a very powerful predictor
in how their HIV progresses over the
decade,” said Mellors, director of the
UPMC AIDS Programs, and an associate
professor of medicine at the medical
school and graduate school of Public
Health.

Another study being conducted by
Pitt researchers has also produced signiﬁ-
cant ﬁndings. Mellors, Debbie McMahon,
Sharon Riddler, and a staff of seven
researchers have been investigating new
therapies for HIV—infected patients using
combinations of different drugs. Their
most successful result was achieved with
the combination of three drugs.

’ The drug combination suppresses the
virus to levels that cannot be readily
detected for as long as a year, and shows
effects in 85 to 90 percent of the individu-
als it is administered to, which is another
promising aspect of their ﬁnding.

But the researchers caution that this is
not a cure, that at this point it is a only way
to control the disease. The difﬁcult part in

 

 

 

FROM PAGE 1

ﬁghting HIV is that most of the infected
people live in poor countries where they
can’t afford water and food, let alone treat-
ment.

“This therapy is progress only for
infected people in the United States,”
Mellors said, “because 90 percent of the
people with the virus live in other coun-
tries where drugs are a fantasy. These
drugs are over $10,000 a year.”

In various parts of the world AIDS is
spreading unchecked, which contributes
to the difficulty of ﬁnding a vaccine for
the virus.

The HIV virus has been a very puz-
zling disease for researchers, but they are
making progress in solving the mystery.
With the new combinations of drugs,
researchers can suppress the virus longer
than they could before.

“A lot of the mystery has been simpli-
ﬁed by our work and others’,” Mellors
said. “Eventually we will have drugs to
suppress HIV, but suppression of the dis-
ease is not a cure; we have along way to
go for a cure.”

A common fear of researchers is that
people will think a vaccine is the cure for
HIV and begin to act recklessly. This will
continue the spread of HIV, which is
already the number one killer among
infectious diseases.

News to re—evaluate the criteria it uses in
ranking colleges and universities.

“In terms of education quality, Pitt
ranks high on the list,” said Service.
“The percentage of alumni giving isn’t
high, but it’s a question of what’s impor-
tant to a prospective student.”

The urban area doesn’t seem to be a
problem affecting Pitt’s reputation. The
University’s Oakland neighbor,
Carnegie-Mellon University, was ranked
28th overall by U.S. News.

“It’s true that in certain areas they
are the academic powerhouse,” said
University Senate Council President
Keith McDuffie. “But we’ve tried to
play the role like a state university, with
more graduate programs than CMU or
Penn State.”

Statistically, Pitt compared well with
other institutions in its tier. Also, factors
like having 94 percent of full time facul-
ty with doctorates contribute to
increased enrollment, such as the l5-per-
cent jump in freshman class size Pitt
experienced this year.

“We’ve had more effective out—of-
state recruiting,” said McDuffie. “We’ve
gotten a much better mix of students
from [outside Pennsylvania].”

The same factors which contribute

 

'l'I-IE P|'l"l' NEWS 3

FROM PAGE I

to higher rankings and higher enrollment
also contribute to the value of a Pitt
degree which assists recent graduates
looking for a job.

Richard Schinagl, a collegiate
recruiter for USX Corporation, one of
Pittsburgh’s largest employers, said the
quality of students Pitt produces also
increases or decreases the value of the
school’s diploma.

He said the graduates from Pitt have
been consistently good, however.

“Pitt produces very competitive
graduates,” said Schinagl. “We’ve had
good luck recruiting quality people from
Pitt.”

According to Schinagl, 243 of
USX’s approximately 4,400 manage-
ment positions are held by Pitt gradu-
ates.

This ratio is somewhat lower than
the ratio of Pitt to non—Pitt degree hold-
ers in jobs in Allegheny county.
According to Service, that number is
about 3-8.

But Pitt’s image deals with more
than just its academic reputation. As the
largest landholder in Oakland, Pitt’s
actions also have a large impact on the
businesses and residents of the Oakland
community.

comes after Pitt Police experienced a dra-
matic increase in stolen bike reports during
the first two months of 1996. Compared to a
year ago, three times as many bikes have
been stolen. . »

After that the rate tailed off tremen-
dously only to rise again this term. A rash of
bike thefts within the past two months has
driven the rate back up to an above average
ﬁgure.

Kathleen Miller of the Pitt Parking and
Transportation Ofﬁce and head of all bike
programs on campus offered tips to bicy-
clists to make sure their bikes don’t get
stolen. Some of them are common sense,
but she said they must be addressed never-
theless.

'“Don’t leave your bike unattended and
unsecured even for just a minute.” Miller
said. “That is just a bad idea. There have
been instances where a student has leaned
his bike against a wall and ran into the book
store for a few seconds. When they retum
they ﬁnd their bike is gone.”

She said one of the best things a student
can do to prevent the theft of their bike is to
register it through her office or the Pitt
Police.

The Police can enter the serial number
into a computer system called the National
Crime Information Center which is connect-
ed to the FBI headquarters in Washington,
D.C.

This allows police all over the country
to track stolen items and return them to their
owners.

The Pitt Police said there are typically

 

FROM PAGE I

two types of bicycle thieves.

The ﬁrst is juveniles who are just doing
it for fun and joyriding, or selling the bikes
for a little spending money. If anyone
notices any suspicious looking juveniles
hanging around bike racks or any other
University buildings, Pitt Police urges them
to report it immediately. “Don’t think
twice,” Boyd said. Dial ‘8ll’ which is the
Pitt Police emergency phone number.

The second most common perpetrator
is the niiddle—aged male drug abuser. Boyd
said they’re mainly crack-cocaine addicts
who steal anything and everything to sup-
port their habit. Unattended mountain bikes
have high market value and are easily stolen
and resold.

With the bike theft rate rising, Pitt
Police are becoming more and more dedi-
cated to eliminating the problem by increas-
ing surveillance of high—risk areas. Officers
are sent on special assignments almost daily
looking for potential bike thieves and moni-
toring racks all over the campus. Uniformed
as well as undercover officers are working
to reduce the dilemma.

The University is also doing all they
can in order to make students’ bikes safer,
including spending an estimated half a rnil—
lion dollars within the last few years to
enhance campus lighting.

Anyone wishing to register their bike
through the Uriiversity’s Parking and
Transportation Ofﬁce can call 624-0687 or
stop by the oﬁce at the Forbes Pavillion at
3525 Forbes Ave. between 8:30 am. and 5
p.m. Monday through Friday.

PiH’s reputation is deserved

ls Pitt’s national reputation fair? Should Pitt really
be considered a second-tier school?

Yes, if you ask the students. Forget U.S. News; the
people who are really qualified to rank Pitt are the stu-
dents, staff, and faculty who are here on a day-to-day
basis. '

One Pitt department head has said, “The problem
with this University is that it’s too goddamn boring!”

It’s easier to find a beer than a book, so the intel-
lectual life outside of classes is lacking.

The big—time sports programs are losers, and we
aren’t open-minded enough to rally around those
sports like women’s volleyball that actually do well.

. The students can’t bring in concerts or other forms
of entertainment, and even if they could, the cost, reg-
ulations, and forms that they must deal with nip stu-
dent enthusiasm in the bud.

- Student groups can’t even use their activities fee
allocation for anything not educational. Classes aren’t
educational enough, apparently.

Pitt treats its students like veal: we’re locked into

small boxes and herded around without as much
respect as is accorded to veal. Students face a hassle to
get even the simplest problem solved, whether it is try-
ing to get a parking permit or resolving an issue with
ﬁnancial aid.

In addition, resident students have the sneaking

' suspicion — if not the actual evidence — that required

expenditures such as the Block meal plan are carefully
disguised swindles. . ‘

The pieces of concrete evidence of how Pitt stu-
dents feel about their school are the alumni giving rate
and the (rising) upperclassman. drop-out rate. Most of
the money is donated by a select group of alumni.
These, incidentally, are probably the same students
who were treated well while they were here. The bulk
of Pitt students, however, feel they should just pay
their money, take their classes, get a few kicks, and get
out quick.

The problems are all the more frustrating because
the education here can be outstanding, and Pitt has so
much potential — but the resources of this school and
this city just aren’t being used to their fullest capacity.
Instead of working to make the most, out of what
exists, such as the facilities at the Masonic Temple, the
students have pipe dreams such as the convocation
center held out before them. The University uses the

stick of requirements and fees to get the students to,

move through, and holds out the carrot of future plans
to keep new ones coming.

THE PITT NEWS

High drama,

 

 

It all came down to three votes,
three lousy votes —— and you, gen-
tle citizen, thought that your vote
wouldn’t mean a thing. i

If you were a mere spectator in
the Student Government Board
elections, or if you ignored them
entirely except to bump into and
perhaps ogle the candidates on your
way to class, you missed out on a
great deal.

They stood out there and froze
handing out their leaﬂets.
Unsubstantiated rumors say that
some ﬁngers may have been given
out with the ﬂyers. If you still have
one lying around your room, and a
funny smell has developed, be sure
that it is actually your socks and not
the rot of the SGB. -

The cold deﬁnitely got to their
faces. Their smiles were frozen into
place, so that in the
room where the tal-
lies were posted, ~ it
looked like the
posters had come
alive. ' ,

The candidates
ﬂoated in and out
and nursed their
ulcers. Most were in
a foul mood. One
candidate, a notorious anti-
Rohypnol crusader, was heard to
shout, “Somebody slip me a
rooﬁe!” Several folks, including
other candidates, ran for glasses of
water.

This planted the seed of an idea

‘in my brain. All of the candidates

for the board spoke at several points
about how the students need to do
something about the apathy on
campus and making the administra-
tion more responsive to student
needs.

So, the new board should do
what they will do with so many
other things, and that is start a
Rohypnol for Uncooperative
Administrators Committee. There
are plenty of administrators who

 

5

roofies, & the SGB election

really do want to make the students
their top priority, but they can’t
work with those who have other
priorities, so what the SGB can do
is get those administrators out of the
way for those who do want to help.

Our generation, despite what it
says, is rather dependent upon
bureaucracies. We nurture and love
them, and we want to join bureau-
cracies. VV1th this love in mind, we
can make the bureaucracies work

for us by only leaving the bureau- .

crats we like around for meetings
and decision making.
Once we perfect the technique,

4 perhaps we can use this at a larger

level; think Bigelow ‘Boulevard.
Imagine if the opponents were
asleep in their chairs on city council
when the road was closed. By the

time they woke up, it would be I

Ferlo Park.

The other thing the SGB
should push for is moving Board of
Trustees’ meetings
to their old home in
the Babcock Room
at the top of the
Cathedral. Like the
SGB elections, this
is one of those little-
known, often

sures. It is a beauti-
ful board room that
looks out on all sides over the city.
Since the board wants to kick
all the students off the committees
and restrict their membership, they
can use the smaller space. The
board stopped having meetings
there because student activists once
trapped them up there by taking
over the elevators and stair cases.
That wouldn’t happen today,
so they have nothing to. worry

‘ about, and if they are going to hand

down decisions from on high, then

' they should be on high when they

do it. As far as what they are high
on, perhaps the SGB could set up
another committee to help the
Board of Trustees with that.
Returning to the elections for a
moment, there are a few things that

ignored Pitt trea- 7

could be done to spice them up as
well. The first is to let the cam-
paigning for SGB operate along the
same principles as the
Homecoming elections. (Finally
we can point to the Homecoming

events for a good example rather

than humor.) »

The students might beneﬁt
from a few more ﬁmky monkeys
on the board. Also, the competition
would give the candidates a better

chance to get their message to the‘

students.

A source close to the SGB tells
me that the current posters were
created to make up for the money
gap that certain candidates might
face. Yet, in the real world, elec-
tions are not completely publicly
funded. Whether they should be or
not is another matter, but we saw
similar political divisions and styles
in the race that we saw in the
national elections. (Other sources
even closer to the SGB say that
there is even some room for scandal
sheet work Gennifer Flowers-type
stuff, but that is for you, gentle
reader to discover.)

We had it all: cigars, smoke-
ﬁlled rooms, town hall meetings,
campaign managers, higher powers
calling the shots, and candidates
who could feel our pain while
wanting to be tools of passion to
fulﬁll our needs. I

What we didn’t have were vot-
ers. I guess that’s like a national
election as well, but it is unfortunate
that people didn’t take the time for

this excitement in their own back
yards

As a parting shot, to all the can-

' didates, it looks as though it will be

a good year. To those who had the
fortitude to run, but didn’t make it
on the board, we’ll see if you put
your energy toward the projects
you said you would work on even if
you didn’t win a seat; that and the
record of the coming year will

show us who the real losers are.

shopping

 

Now that Thanksgiving has come
and gone and the Turkey Bowls have
named their MVPs, the best time of
the year is only a few weeks away.
My stocking is hung, but I don’t have
a chimney, so I had to improvise and
use my never—say-die mannequin. I
put up my lights that I realized make
the room spin worse after a V few
dozen Beasts are emptied.

And Ihave also compiled my list
of gifts for some who have been
naughty, some who have been nice,
and even some who haven’t been
much of anything. I’m saving up for
a trip to the Bahamas, so if you’re
name isn’t on the list I apologize and
maybe we can, work something out.
So without further adieu, my wishes
for this joyous holiday season.

:.Ned _ Schano

Before Pitt’s ﬁnal game of the 1996
football season on Saturday, Chancellor
Mark N ordenberg gave a brief speech to
departing Head Coach Johnny Majors.

“Johnny is a wonderful ambassador
for this University and all of western
PA,” Nordenberg said. “Good luck and

bring home a victory.”

Bring home a victory is just what
Pitt did, dismantling the Rutgers Scarlet
Knights 24-9 to ﬁnish the season 4-7.

The Panthers disregarded their
defensive reputation and held the '
Scarlet Knights to only nine points and
219 yards. Coming into the game, Pitt
was last in scoring defense (yielding
42.1 points per game) and total

(475 yards per game).

. Of course, the win came against a
hapless Rutgers team that ﬁnished the
season 2-9 and 1-6 in the Big East. With
Pitt’s win, the team ﬁnishes with a
respectable 3-4 conference record, good

for fifth place.

‘‘I look for this program to continue
to improve in the future,” Majors said
after the game. Even though the hype of
the game was focused on Major’s
departure, the exiting coach said the
game is made for the players.

defense

The game started slowly for the
Panthers. Ontheir first offensive play,
quarterback Matt Lytle lofted a pass
intended for Mark Butler that was inter-
cepted at the Rutgers 48 by cornerback
Cameron Chadwick. ‘

Matt Lytle finishes the season with his best game as a Panther.

Rutgers, however, was unable to
capitalize on the miscue as well as a
high snap on a Nate Cochran punt on
Pitt’s next possession. ‘ '

team to break paydiit. On the first play
of the second quarter, tailback Chad
Bosch snuck in for a touchdown.
Rutgers didn’t do much the rest of the
game.

Pitt countered with a 81-yard drive
capped off by a Dwayne Schulters six-
yard touchdown run. Pitt expanded its
lead to 14-6 following an interception by

FROM PAGE 7

 

Curtis Anderson who ran the ball to the I

seven-yard line. Another Schulters
touchdown run gave the Panthers an
eight-point halftime lead.

Following a Rutgers ﬁeld goal early
in the third quarter (the Scarlet Knight’s
first ﬁeld goal since Sept. 7), quarter-
back Matt Lytle tossed his only touch-
down pass, the Panthers’ longest com-
pletion of the year. Receiver Jake Hoffart
contorted his body in the air before haul-
ing down a 48-yard pass, his ﬁfth touch-
down of the year.

“I saw Jake one-on-one, so I gave it
a shot and he made a heck of a grab,”
Lytle said.

Pitt added a Chris Ferencik ﬁeld
goal at 2:11 of the third quarter (his 38th
point of the year) to.round out the scor-
ing at 24-9.

Following the game, Panther players
hoisted Coach Majors on their shoulders
and carried him off the ﬁeld.

Majors summarized the game say-
ing, “It was a great way to end my career
at Pitt.”

Hoops

“[UNC] made as good adjust-
ment,” Coach Willard said. “They put
two guys down on the blocks and
rotated them.’.’ ,

That rotation affected the play of
Pitt’s big men. Center Mark Blount
managed only one point. Carolina’s

front-line dominated. Besides the

‘career day of Jamison, forward Vince
Carter scored 16 and Ademola
Okulaja netted 17.

The game marked the first time
Pitt scored over 50 points in a game
this season.
