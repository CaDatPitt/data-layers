Ann Walko
Writes Top

Compositioi 

By HARRIET WEHNER
Mrs. Ann Walko, Arts writ-
ing major, (gained top honor
in this year’s Atlantic Month-

ly’s Creative Writing Contest.

Her prize-winning essay,
“Our Boarders,” out-ranked
the best short _story and poem
in quality and creativeness, and
the Atlantic Monthly’s judges
acknowledged this by awarding
her the free tuition scholarship
to Bread Loaf School of English
at Middlebury, Vermont. _

Mrs. Walko and the students
with prize winning entries in the
short story and poetry ﬁelds each
received $100.

Six Week Session

The Bread Loaf scholarship en-
ables both the student, Mrs. Wal-
ko, and her instructor in the En-
glish 18 class, Miss Emily G.
Irvine, professor of English, to
attend the annual six ‘week suin-
mer session in the rustic area of
Middlebury.

The embryo of her prize win-
hing essay was a two-page pa-
per which Miss Irvine urged her
to expand. The expansion sur-
passed 10,000 words, and the
chore of cutting it down to 2,500
words was necessary in order
that it meet the speciﬁcations of
the Atlantic’s contest.

‘‘It was easy to cut it from
10,000 to 6,000,” Mrs. Walko said,
“but afterreaching that point, it
was hard —- cutting meant losing
something.”

Peace Corps
Plans Future

The only reason that the Peace
Corps has not met with immediate
and overwhelming success is that
“until April 1 it was still rela-
tively disorganized and suffered
from a lack of publicity,” Nancy
Gore, a Peace Corps staff assistant
Said recently. —

Miss Gore, meeting with stu-
dents interested in the Peace Corps
at the Office of Cultural and Edu-
cational Exchange, attempted to
answer questions concerning the
necessary testing and training pro-
gram.

The ﬁrst tests, which will be
given May 27 and June 2 at the
Victory Building, are only the pre-
liminary tests in a series of ex-
tensive personal examinations to
determine if the candidate can be
of service and can survive.

_ Following‘ these tests a candi-
date is accepted into the train-
ing program in which he will
undergo language and survival
training.

Thus far the Peace Corps plans
on a two to six month training
period during which weeding out
of unde.si.rablc camdidates will con-
tinue.

Miss Gore empliasizcd that
college training’ is not neces-
sary: there is a need for people
with practical skills who would
also be winning to serve.

Those interested in the program
may obtain further information
through the Office of Cultural and
Educational Exchange, 603 Brack-
enridge.

Nationality Rooms Close
For Movie Production

Cameramen have invaded the Cathedral of Learning
until May 27 in order to ﬁlm the Nationality Classrooms for

a movie authorized by the U.

S. Information Agency. These

rooms will be closed to student use until that date.
Called “Tower of Learning,” the ﬁlm will be translated
into 41 languages. It is 20 minutes in length, and recorded

in full color.

The movie depicts the Nation-
ality Classrooms genuine
American feeling -- a melting pot
for the cultures ofthe Old World.
Since the rooms were constructed
before World War 11, any rela-
tion to the present cold war is
avoided.

Thought Idea

Gene Wycoﬂ’, script writer, for
the movie, thought up the idea
after making another movie here
earlier in the school year, and
convinced International Movie Di-
vision of U.S.I.A. to produce
“Tower of Learning.”

University students will par-
ticipate in the film. These stu-
dents are presently being se-
lected. Some of the scenes will
contain actual classes in session.

John G .Bowman, former Chan-
cellor of the University, appears
in the production. He was largely
responsible for the creation of the
classrooms.

Offers Scholarship

In the beginning of the picture,
ex—chancellor Bowman offers a

male candidate on the condition
the student accompany him on a
tour of various nationality groups
around the city.

The tour starts when the two

Dr. Bowman points out places

tian picnic, Scottish clans, etc.

Army Secretary
To Address Local

Secretary of the Army Elvis J.
Stahr, Jr., a former vice chan-

companion is a “red dwarf.”

This is the sixth such star dis-
coveredby Allegheny Observatory
since 1929. Only 24 have been lo-
cated by astronomers throughout
the world, four of them by the
naked eye in the 19th Century.

,Tracks Companion

By tracking its bright com-
panion, Dr. Wagman suspected the
graph of its course would indicate
the presence of another “dark
star.” Around the 17th of March
he knew that it really existed.

A certain wave pattern in the
path of Mu Cassiopeiae, which
varied from the normal straight
line course, gave positive proof
of its dark companion.

The “red dwarf” is one of the
nearer stars, being only 26 light
years from the earth. An idea of
its distance can be gotten by com-
paring its distance from ‘the earth
with that of the sun. The sun is
eight light minutes away.

Its mass is only .17 of the the
'sun’s mass. The chief reason, how-
ever, why these stars are not
easily discovered is that graphs
of their bright companions are
necessary. These bright compan-
ions take from ten to 20 years of
observation before they can be
plotted, because the two stars
need this time to complete a full
cycle.

Breaks Monotnny

When asked if he was excited
about the discovery, Dr. Wagm-an
paused a moment and said, “Well,
it’s an interesting variation . . .
break the monotony.”

He continued, “It means more
work, because we have to plot
it in two dimensions.”

Dr. VVagman used the Thaw
Memorial Telescope to trace Mu
Cassiopeiae. This telescope is the
third largest refractor in the
United States. It has a 30
lens with‘ a 46 foot focal length.

The Thaw telescope was manu-
factured in 1914 by the Brashcar
Company, and is still the largest

Wagman Discovers
Another ‘Dark Star, ,.

Years of research and labor paid off recently for Dr.
Nicholas E. Wagman, director of the University’s Allegheny-_,_,

After tracking Mu Cassiopeiae from 1933 to 1957 to de-

star, from the ﬁfth magnitude, had a twin companion in-
visible to even the telescope. Theﬁc

European Review

By NIATT NESVISKY

As dean of the School of

preaches.

Public and International Af-

fairs, Dr. Donald C. Stone is a man who practices what he‘

This is proven by his recent travels to Europe and Africa,
where he spents months studying and evaluating foreign
education and administration methods and problems.

Stone visited Belgium,

and -Yugoslavia as a
representative of the government
agency, the International Co-
operation Administration. He then
traveled through Africa, including
the countries of Egypt, Sudan,
Tanganyika, Kenya, Nigeria,
Ghana and Liberia, as a “private
citizen” and as member of the
University faculty.

Had Three Reasons

The purpose of his journey was
threefold. Dr. Stone “evaluated
theiplans and organization of the

Dr.

economic and social development 

of the countries, reviewed the
methods of “Africanization” on
that continent, and studied the
effect that our programs are hav-
ing in those foreign countries.”
During his three months
ab-road, Dr. Stone collected ma-
terial which he expects to turn
into a book, and sent tape re-
cordings containing notes. and
observation back to the Uni-
versity.

The Dean was mainly concern-
ed with Africa. He observed that
s“African.s are becoming civilized
at an unbelievablesrate, and their
education and political leadership
must be developed to avoid
chaos.”

He continued that “Americans
must be competently trained to
work‘with the problems of our
growing neighbors on other con-
tinents.”

Building Reputation

He added that he was quite
impressed with the University’s
program of training our people to
deal with Africa and training
Africans to handle themselves.

“The University of Pitts-
burgh,” he smiled, “has made a
name for itself in the African

nations.” He enumerated the
impressive number of African
alumni on the dark continent.

“The great political movements
in Africa really appear to be in
the hands of only a few people.
Loyalty in tr ose countries are not
national, but of tribes and clans.”

He added that the British have
done an excellent job of setting
up their colonies for independ-
ence, that some Liberians, who
have been free for 100 years, ex-
pressed their jealousy of the high
standard of living of the colonies.

(Continued from Page 1)
department secretary and the
mother of three high school chil-
dren, anticipated her first day of
classes at Bread Loaf on June 28
with mixed feelings.

“_I’m a small town person,”
she explained,’ and the experi-
ence and knowledge of the peo-
ple attending Bread Loaf fright-
ens me..” This fear stems
mainly from what she called “a
meagre knowledge of contem-
porary writing.”

Her summer schedule at Bread
Loaf includes courses in writing
the short story and essay, Art of
Fiction, and Metaphor, Symbol
and Myth. .

But the Atlantic’s judgeswho
read her essay, “Our Boarders” --
a description of the “Immigrant
Slav,” what he is and how he
lives in America, -— recognized a
quality which illustrated good
writing whether described in con-
temporary or non-contemporary
terms.

Made Up Stories

Mrs. Walko’s interest in writ.ing
began a long time before 1958,
when she registered for her ﬁrst
writing course at the University.
“I made up stories,” she said,
“before I knew how to write.”

Her writing range stretches
from “Around Home” columns
in The Westinghouse Valley
News to short stories in antholo-
gies of unknown writers, to let-
ters to Boris Pasternak, Russian
author of Dr. Zhivago.

The letter Mrs. Walko received
from Mr. Pasternak a few months
before his death is one of her
“most valuable possessions.” He
wrote “Out of the midst of my
over occupation, "I nod my head to
you, I make you kisses for your
kind gentleness.”

Carried on Correspondence

Mrs. Walko said the corres-
pondence began when she thanked
him for “a moment of pure de-
light” which he gave to her, a
reader, in his novel, Dr. Zhivago.

Refusing to reveal her age be-
cause “it is discouraging to pro-
spcctive young writers,” Mrs.
Walko said that she owed thanks
to those people who encouraged
her to attend the University, and
the writing‘ instructors who are
helping her to develop the tools
by which she can dig out that
“something” within which she
feels compelled to express.

The University means many
things to Mrs. Walko. By working
here she can help her husband,

Kanell Seeks Two
Weight Records

By JACK Sl\TITH
Should the Panther track

men beat

Stadium, they would top off

ceedingly dull season.

But at the very least it would
take performances that equal
those recorded in the State meet
last week. This would mean that
Dan Kanell must equal his shot-
put mark of 54-4%. Kanell is cap-
able of the stadium record which
is only 3/£1-inch off the mark of
54-51,/2 set by Tom Jones of
Miami in 1954.

Another mark which Kanell,
who has been Pitt’s strongman
all season, claims he is going to
break this week is the discus
standard of 169-3 set by Wes King
in ’58.

Result of Work 4

This is the record Big‘ Kanell
has been seeking all season. The
record of the shot came as a ‘re-
sult of his work with weights
and, of course, practice. Kanell
performances throughout the Pan-
ther’s 1-4 season has usually been
just a little better than his closest
competitor.

If the compet.ition is “rough
Saturday, the 6-5 co-captain
could easily smash both the dis-
cus and shotput marks.

Kanell has been one of the few
driving forces in the Panther’s
mediocre season, if he has his way
this week “all of our performers
will surprise Notre Dame.”

6 Week Summer

Sessions to Run
June 24 - August

The university is again offering
six weeks of summer sessions this
year.

The program was set up for
high ' school graduates, public
school graduates, public school
teachers, students who desire to
continue study throughout the
year, and those who combine part-
time study throughout the year
with full-time summer study.

Sessions begin June 26 and end
Aug. 4. Registration deadline is
June 24. ‘Most campus classes will
be morning sessions. No night
classes will be offered. Classes
will meet five days a week.

The School of Liberal Arts,
the School of Education, Johns-
town College, and the Pyma-
tuning Laboratory, of Field Bi-
ology will participate in the
summer sessions. .

A variety of courses, ranging
from undergraduate Freshman
subjects to graduate courses in
Mathematics and Education, will
be offered.

V. W. Adams, director of Suin-
mer Sessions, expects an enroll-
ment of 1800. Last year over 1700
attended the summer sessions.

Besides regular courses, sum-
mer sessions will offer its stu-
dents the Midday Series, a Sum-
mer Lecture Series on Educa-
tion, housing, and such services
as the Book Center. Students at
Pymatuning will have available
that area’s many facilities for
studying the natural sciences.

“Summer is a time when teach-
ers are free and can work on de-
grees,” said Adams. “In summer
the University can also bring out-
standing people to its campusgto
supplement the regular teaching
staff.”
