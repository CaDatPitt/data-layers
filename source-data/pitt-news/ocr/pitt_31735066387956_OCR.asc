Ceiling
ﬁgure
for reserve

 set

By Alicia M. Hall
For The Pitt News

A $50,000 ceiling figure will be
the main feature of a new policy
being developed by the Student
Government Allocations
Committee to safeguard the
operations of the reserve fund.

The reserve fund is used
primarily to finance expenditures
that are covered by the general
allocations fund. Past funding has
provided the money for the neon
sculpture in the grand concourse
of the William Pitt Union and the
African wood bench on the corner
of Bigelow and Fifth. ,

The decision to limit the amount

a of the fund came at the end of the
 1988-89 fiscal year when the

balance stood, as it currently does,
at $72,523. Last week, allocations
committee chair Gil Borok met

. with SGB president Kent Baldauf

andSGB advisersjoyce Giangarlo

and Terrence Milani to discuss‘

the situation and what actions

could be taken to -prevent the .
I account

from running over
$50,000 in the future.

It was also decided that the
best procedure would be to let

the extra $22,000 remain in the V

account until expenditures

_ totaling that amount or above are
‘ made.

“We’re not worried about the
present,” Borok said. “We’re
worried about future policy.”

In the past, the reserve fund
was replenished each year by
monies allocated but not spent at

I the end of the ﬁscal year. The

basic purpose of this system, to
maintain the reserve fund, will
remain; however, the amount
deposited is not permitted to
cause the account to exceed
$50,000.

Borok explained that any other
money left over will be placed in
the general fund for the following
year. Some amount of unspent
money from the previous year
always rolls over into the next
year’s general fund.

“If for some reason we want an
expenditure from the reserve fund
that is more than we have in the
fund, we will commit [payment]
for more than one year,” said
Borok, to demonstrate that the
cap on the fund should not limit
‘:7'1e ﬁnancial resources available
ynrough the allocations
committee. “The alternative is for
the Board to propose $50,000
from the reserve fund and the

AIDS fears

Andrea Barczykowski
For The Pitt News

' Because of the threat of AIDS
and other sexually transmitted
diseases, more Pitt students are
using condoms for protection,
according to university health
officials. _

“I can’t give you an exact
number, but there has been a
definite increase in condom
sales,” said Chuck Dobbs, who
works in the pharmacy at the
Student Health Service.

Although sales have been

increasing, a survey done by

Shirley Haberman from Student
Health Education showed that of
the 66 percent of sexually active
Pitt students, only 20 percent use
condoms primarily for protection
against STDs.

“Students don’t think it affects
them; they don’t believe they are

cause rise in safe sex on campus  

susceptible to the AIDS virus,”
said Haberman.

Haberman’s study also showed
that 22 percent of the sexually
active students had two or more
partners in a period of six months.
SHS tries to make AIDS education
available to Pitt students and even
included a condom coupon in
the freshman survival kits.
However, although Haberman
believes in promoting condom
use, she said, “I don’t want the
students who aren’t sexually
active to think that everyone is
having sex.

“I don’t want to give a false
sense of security, though. There
is still the problem of incorrect
use and breakage of the condom, ”
Haberman said.

Candy Miller, of SHS, also
conducted a survey to find out
how much Pitt students knew
about AIDS.

“Their knowledge of AIDS was
very good. They seem to know
the facts. This doesn't mean that
they put knowledge into practice, ”
said Miller. a

The survey did show that
students are using condoms more
often than they used to.

“It is our desire that they use
condoms every time, and [that
they] use a spermicide for more
protection,” Miller said.

But spermicides are not used
that often. “People generally just
buy the condoms," said Dobbs.

Anyone who receives
prescribed birth control from SHS
must attend a family planning
session. Condom use is still
encouraged along with other
forms of contraception to protect
against STDs.

But Miller also tries to promote
abstinence because it is the only
100 percent effective form of

protection.

-Another survey, conducted by
Jan DeVoe, Nurse Educator at
Forbes Clinic, asked the students
if the threat of AIDS had changed
their lifestyles. Many students
said that they have limited their
number of partners, talked more
openly about safe sex and started
to use condoms. I

But a big problem is that 33
percent of the students said that
they have had unintended sex
because they were drinking.

“Usually unplanned means
unprotected," said DeVoe.

In general, students are aware
of the dangers and are using
condoms more often.

“But what is indicated by this
study is that people still have
risky behaviors,” said DeVoe.

Weight uiatching should be a concern for freshmen

Byjenifer Crook
Staff Writer
. 9.
Waiting for hours in never-

ending lines at Thackeray Hall, '

struggling to make sense of ia
foreign TA in a Friday afternoon
recitation and studying till the
crack of _dawn for tomorrow’s
crucial midterm — all just a part of
the price a college student must
pay to get the “big gains” in life.

But unfortunately for many
beginning coeds, the stress-filled

- lifestyle that preps them for the

years of success can also bring
them big gains in some very
unwelcome places — like their

hips and outer thighs;

The freshman 15 — those
rumored pounds that freshmen
girls add on when they go to
school — have been a source of
joking for upperclassman guys
for years. But for the people
involved, it is no laughing matter.

A recent study conducted by
Stanford University, as printed in
Cosmopolitan A magazine,
confirmed the long—suspected
connection of college and weight
gain. Researchers found that
freshman students who live in
college dormitories gained an

'*'3average’of eight pounds their

first year. \

freshman Tara Ambrose, the fear
of falling victim to the Freshman
15 is very real. ‘

“I wasn’t really scared until my
brother started going, ‘Oh, you’re

most girls -— you'll gain 15 pounds
before you know it,” said
Ambrose. '

“IMy roommate and II study
until like two or three in the
morning, and our last meal was at
five, so we usually order a, pizza
or . something. “You just get

. hungry,” she added.

But what causes freshman

rest from the general fund.”
In such a case, when the
reserve fund account would then

be empty, the replenishing of the 1

fund to $50,000 may take a
number of years depending on
 much money is left at the
end of the fiscal year.

Borok also noted that the

reserve fund will no longer be‘
saved in case of over-allocation
or budget deficit, but will instead
be used only for capital
expenditures. Because money
will roll over into the next year’s

jgudget, that money can be used

for deficits.

“[The fund] will be a nice lump
sum to start with in the future,"
Borok said.

Once formalized, the complete
proposal will be written into the
allocations committee handbook.

coeds to be so susceptible to
weight gain? According to Shirley
Haberman, a health educator with
Pitt's student health service, many
factors can contribute. One
reason, she said, is that students I
living. away from home for the
first time often think food can
help them deal with the stress.
“[Freshmenl are trying to adjust
to a new life; they’re trying to
make friends and keep up
socially, while they’re pressured

, to succeed academically. So a lot

of them turn to food to make
them feel better,” said Haberman.

Haberman said that the many
eating options new students
discover make the temptation to
pig-out a hard one to resist.

“Suddenly, there’s all these new
choices around. They can go to
the cafeteria and eat whatever
they want and however much
they want of it. They can have
pizza, burgers and ice cream in
unlimited quantities. No one’s
watching over their shoulders.
When they’re up late studying,
just about anything they want to
eat is available on Forbes Avenue.
Some students just go overboard,”
she said.

So how do students keep their
sanity intact without the daily’

, “late-night food run?” The key,
And for many students, like Pitt 1

said Haberman, is through
gradually making changes toward
healthier eating habits and

S exercise. For students who aren’t

aware of what comprises a healthy
diet, Haberman suggests they
make an appointment with the
dietician at Pitt's ‘Student ‘Health

' Service.

“Most students were fortunate
enough to get we1l—balanced

meals at home, so they just_have

to copy that example at school.
But it’s not unusual to see college

students who don’t understand

the importance of the four basic
food groups.”

Haberman suggests that
students: ‘

—Make deliberate choices in
the cafeteria. Select;broiled and
baked foods before fried ones.

—Take advantage} of the salad
bar - without drowning the salad
in dressings loaded with fat.

——Substitute fruit for ice-cream
and other fattening desserts. ~ .

——Try popcorn in place of fast-
food late-night . snacks ‘— it’s.
inexpensive and has relatively
few calories.

———For salt cravings, pretzel
sticks are preferable to potato
and corn chips.

But this doesn’t mean students
don’t have to completely cut
themselves off from foods they
love, said"Haberman.

“You don’t have to deprive
yourself.; just eat healthier. No
one expects a radical diet change.
Just try to modify your life a few
changes at a time.”

For weight loss, exercise is
crucial, said Haberman,isince the
human metabolism slows down
with age. ,

“You can’t just keep eating the
same quantity and not expect to
gain some weight,” said
Haberman. “And if you’re not
involved in some sort of exercise
program, you’re just taking in the

calories at a much faster rate than '

you’re burning them off.”

In addition to helping withk

weight control, Haberman said
that exercising will also help
relieve some of the stress a student
faces. The SHS suggests that
students work out three times a
week for at least 15 minutes per
session. Trees Hall and the Pitt
fieldhouse offer many facilities
for student use, - including
basketball, tennis and volleyball
courts, a weight room, swimming
pool and a golf range. Aerobic
classes are also offered through

the leisure learning program and .

the collegiate YMCA. 

And if students find they, need
a little help keeping off the ight,
Haberman said that the SHS pffers
a free eight-week program called
“Take it off and keep it offi”

“It’s state-of-the-art in offering
what are now considered the
soundest approaches to losing

weight and maintaining the loss,”

said Haberman. » V;

In the program, which begins
this Thursday, students learn to
live healthier through a three-
prong approach, advocating

proper nutrition, exercise and

behavior modification.

“They start right away talking
about losing weight. Discussion
is a very important part of it.

They keep food diaries. 'There’s

a lot of exchangebetween the
participants of the program, and

they learn some
guidelines,” she said.

However, Haberman stressed
that Pitt's program is not a “diet
club” replica. A

“To some extent, it’s similar.
But some programs fall short by
leaving out one of the three
components. Half of this class is
devoted to actually doing
exercise; they do aerobics.”

While staying in shape and
looking good is very important,
Haberman stressed that students
need to make the change one
step at a time: “The best success
comes from a gradual approach.
There really are no quick fixes. It

important

takes time, and the best success.
comes form a gradual approach, '

where you lose a few pounds a

week, not 30 pounds the first

month. That’s simply not healthy.”

  PTL ﬂock still loyal

Jim Bakker has been wronged? ,

According to many of Bakker’s loyal fans, the “most
reverend” Jim Bakker should not be standing trial for 24
fraud and conspiracy counts, nor should he be facing a
possible 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in
fines. J _

According to Elizabeth Sacco, an employee of PTL until
1986 when she was laid off, “I feel loyalty because I’ve
seen what this man built. VA greedy man doesn’t have his
hair turn gray in five years.” 3 - ' -
» Bakker is charged with overselling the lifetime partner-

ships for $1,000 each which bought their members three I

nights of lodgingia year for life, for a total of $3.7 million.
However, Bakker’s followers said that they were happy
to pay $1,000 for their partnerships-, even though the
government alleges that Bakker sold more than twice as
many of these partnerships as he could accommodate.
Some PTL followers, who, incidentally, had no trouble
booking their stays in Bakker’s Heritage Grand Hotel,

. described the time spent there as “heavenly.” They also

describe Jim and Tammy Bakker as “upright and truthful

Why do the people who have been swindled still stand
up for the Bakkers and their ministry? Is it only because
Jim Bakker’s hair has turned gray?_ Or is it because they
admire Tammy Bakker’s makeup job? What do their
appearances have to do with the fact that they apparently
used a ministry to better their financial situation?

And still, despite all the evidence against Bakker, his
followers still cling to the facade that he managed to
construct. After several years of the unraveling of the_PT L
scandal, it would seem that even the most loyal of
Bakker’s followers would have abandoned this sinking
ship by now. But still  ,

communion to anyone dressed

like “hookers or soccer players,” ,

Freshman studies not just wasting time

Let’s talk turkey about Freshman
Studies 1. ,

It has come to my attention that
some freshmen are having a little
problem with this class, namely,
they think that it might be a waste
of their time. This interests me

because I am a teaching assistant ,

for PS1, and I am a very busy
person. The last thing I have time
to do is waste someone else’s
time.

For those of you who are not if 
freshmen, and are unaware of ,

what FS1 is, I will brief you. FS1
is not, in fact, a new course. I
took it two years ago when I was
a freshman, under the title of
“Introduction to the University.”
The" difference is that I chose to-
take it because I was interestedin a
learning about Pitt. I thought that '
the course would be a good way
for me to ease, into what I had
heard would be a difficult adap-
tion to a large urban university. I
thought, if nothing else, that I
might have the opportunity to
meet a few new members of my
class. .

The difference between the
course I took two years ago and
F81 is that the latter is no longer
a course which interested stu-
dents decide to take. FS1 is re-
quired of all freshmen. This re-
quirement has caused, as ex-
pected, some turmoil.

However, it should be noted
that a great many people “who
know better” were involved in
the decision-making process. The

shirt.. Putting on his best Jerry
Falwell smile, he confronts the
man:

F. G.: Sinner, what is your
name?

Jesus: Jesus Christ.

F.G.:. I'm sorry Mr. Christ, but
you cannot enter the House of
God dressed as a sinner.

Jesus: It is not what a man
wears on his body, but rather the
state of his soul which deter-
mines whether or not he is fit to
enter the House of God.

F.G.: O, my poor, confused
soul. I can only hope that time
will reveal to you that fashion

 

Dean of CAS, the director of New
Student Programs, several of their
colleges and a panel of 60 men-

tors (both upperclassmen and

freshmen) debated the idea of re-
quiring.FS1 for almost the dura-
tion of last winter term.

The decision to make the
course mandatory was based on
a theory that there is a‘ spectrum
of “types” in any college class.

On one end of, the spectrum are L

the ambitious people who will
get involved in their school no

. matter what. On the other end

are those who simply want a to
get a 2.5 and go home to hang out
with their friends from high
school. However, these “end-
types” are in the minority, for in
the center of the spectrum lies a
vast array of students who simply
need a little. “shove” and they will
be off to very successful college
careers. To make. the course
optional is to expect only the
motivated end, who need the
course the least of all. To make
it required would annoy the to-

tally uninterested end, but at least a

it would give the majority of
“middle men” the necessary
shove.

I suppose that as hard as I try,

constitutes the path to Heaven
l...l. i
What type of priest do you
have to be to refuse communion
to someone who isn’t dressed as
you see fit? One can only ponder
Father Griese’s next step. My
money is on Christian Dior tweed-
clad alter boys. l...l
Gentleman 3 Quarterlybeware!
Citizens of Dayton need only to
pay a visitto Sacred Heart to find
out what's hot and what’s not this
fall. I
I would pay a very large sum of
money to see the exchange be-
tween St. Peter and Father Griese

there is little I can do to make this ,

boost particularly pleasant. I
assume that freshmen believe this,
course is cramping the style of»
their newly found independence. I
They may ‘already feel like losers
because they are freshmen, and
this course is justmaking it worse

, by singling them out. What kind

of cool dude upperclassman
would want to view a video on

“how to use PittCat?”.

In my opinion, they are a lucky

bunch. For come January,-there . 

is little ‘doubt in my mind that
they will know more about this
school than the majority of up-
perclassmen do. Iknow I did
after I took the class. I

And so, freshmen -- my advice
to you is grin and bear it. Inthe

mean time, maybe you could try P A J
and learn something -— that’s

what you're here for. Whining

and complaining will get you '
nowhere — in this university,

anyway. At least if you learn
nothing else, you will have
learned that.

I’ll be interested in seeing the
statistics in winter term. When
the dropout rate has decreased,

the average freshman GPA is .

increased and the number of
freshmen involved in extracur-
ricular activities is more than ever
before. .._. When I hear reports
about freshmen who had pros-
perous, happy first years, then I
will know that I didn’t waste
anyonefs time.

_ The second coming had better not take place in Dayton, Ohio

at the pearly gates:

St. Peter: Name.

F.G.: Father Griese.

St. Peter: I’m sorry, but my
notebook shows your soul to be
unprepared for Heaven.

F.G.: What are you, some kind
of a nutbag? Look at this suit —

custom made in Paris! $1,000!_

Rolex! Gold fillings! I had to melt
my ?#@!?# chalice for these!

At this point St. Peter escorts
Father Griese to the elevator.
Going down? You bet!

Van Pelt throws Pitt past 11th ranked Syracuse

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Darnell who?
Alex’ Van Pelt walked into Pitt Stadium
Saturday night with 26 completions for

357 yards and three touchdowns on the ,

season. He left with 25 more completions,
a 306- yard outing and an integral part of
Pitt’s first 3-0 start since 1982.

Pitt vs. Syracuse was supposed to bea
struggle between two of the stingiest
defenses in the nation. However, Van
Pelt’s statistics along with Derrik Lewis’
three touchdowns and CurvinRichards’
100-yard effort dictate otherwise.

The Panthers compiled 467 yards in
total offense as they downed the previously
undefeated Syracuse Oran gemen Saturday
night in front of a national television
audience, 30-23.

Pitt’s win should put them into the Top
10 for the first time since 1983, as the
Panthers ﬁnally broke their five-game
losing streak against the Orangemen.

After the contest, almost everyone
involved in the game was singing praises
to Van Pelt, including Syracuse coach
Dick MacPherson.

“He [Van Pelt] was remarkable. He put
the ball in there almost every -time. It’s

, been a long time since anyone ever moved

the ball like that on us,” MacPherson said.

Pitt defensive tackle Marc Spindler was
equally impressed with the Panther field
general. V

“Just by looking at Alex’s performance,
you don’t need to ask any questions. He
just did a heck of a job and carried out his
fakes great. He threw the ball the best I’ve
ever seen since I’ve been here,” Spindler
said.

There were some tense moments in the
fourth quarter as John Biskup’s 26-yard
field goal brought the Orange to within
seven with 5:52 remaining, but the Panthers
stopped the Syracuse final drive as Louis
Riddick picked off Bill Scharr’s “Hail Mary”
pass with eight seconds remaining to end
the game. 9

The start of the game was a quick one.

' After only 32 seconds into the first quarter,

each team had one play, one touchdown
and a resulting 6-6 tie.

Syracuse opened with a Scharr handoff
to wide receiver Scott Carpenter, who
threw the option pass to a wide open Rob
Moore for a 69-yard touchdown. The
ensuing extra point by Biskup was no
good.

After a Steve Israel kickoff return, Pitt
countered the Orange heroics with Van
Pelt hitting Henry Tuten for a 61-yard
touchdown bomb to tie the score at six

apiece. Ed Frazier rriissed the extra point
as a result of a ﬂubbed hold by Doug
Hetzler.

It turns out that Van Pelt had a very early
score on his mind before the game even
started.

“I told Tony Siragusa before the game
that we were going to hit the touchdown
on the first play. It ended up that they got
the touchdown on the first play and I
looked at Tony and said, ‘Hey, we’re still
going to hit it’ because we have confidence
in that play and that’s what happened,”
Van Pelt said.

With 11:07 to go in the first quarter,
Frazier hit a 23-yard field goal to put the
Panthers up 9-6.

The tenacious Panther defense set up
the next score when Tom Sims sacked
Scharr at the Syracuse 10-yard line. On the
next play, Richard Allen picked up a
Duane Kinnon fumble on the two-yard

-line. .

Van Pelt then handed off to Lewis for his
first TD as the Panthers marched two yards
in one play that took three seconds to take
a 16-6 lead.

With one minute to go in the first,
Syracuse closed the gap at 16-13 as Michael
Owens galloped 12 yards into the end
zone. But that was the closest they would
get all night.

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Quarterback Alex Van Pelt (10) was able to fake out the Syracuse defense all day, amassing 306 yards and one
touchdown. The Panthers were able to stave off a late rally, topping the Orangemen 30-23 Saturday night.

Steelers taste victory with 27-14 Win over Vikings

The only scoring in the second quarter
came on Lewis’ second touchdown on a 4-
yard run which culminated an 85-yard,
eight play drive, as Pitt went up 23-13.

The Panther defense terrorized Scharr
all evening as they recorded five sacks
alone in the first half and eight all told.

Coach Mike Gottfried was especially
pleased with his second defensive team
and the effort they put forth.

“Defensively, both teams that We put in
the ball game played well. The second
group that went in really had some success
the whole-way,” Gottfried said.

According to Spindler, the second
defensive team was the key to the Panthers’
success. 8

“I think they were the difference in the
ball game. They played a level up, better
than they ever played before, and ‘I think
they’re a great credit to us,” Spindler said.

Van Pelt opened the third quarter by
engineering a textbook 70-yard drive which
ended with Lewis’ third and final
touchdown as he broke threw the middle
for a 4—yard run on ﬁrst and goal to post
Pitt’s lead at 30-13. '

Syracuse countered late in the period as
Scharr hit Carpenter for an 8-yard
touchdown to allow the Orange to come
within 10 points.

Loyal PTL followers are
desperate for a miracle with all
the turmoil surrounding their
beloved ministry. The Steelers
took the place of the on-trial Jim
Bakker and performed the biggest
rriiracle of the year so far.

Ripley may not even believe
this one. .

‘After being outscored in their
first two games 93-10, the Steelers
looked like a football team

yesterday and defeated the
Minnesota Vikings 27-14. Both
teams are now 1-2.

“When you see your team
perform like that, it makes you
smile a little bit," said Steeler
head coach Chuck Noll. “It was a
classic team effort. We seem to
have been able to put most of our
mistakes behind us, and we had
an outstanding performance by
our offense.”

The Steeler offense, ranked last
before the game, had 278 total
yards against the Vikings top-

rated defense.

But the Steeler offense wasn’t
the only part of the game that
improved from their losses. The
defense held Minnesota to just
258 total yards and one first
quarter touchdown.

“They beat us every way,” said
Viking head coach Jerry Burns.
“We didn’t do the job offensively
or defensively. They outcoached
us and had a better plan, and we
had some dumb penalties. They
took it to us right from the
beginning." 0

They sure did. The Steelers
took the opening drive 81 yards
into the end zone for the first
score of the game. The drive was
capped off with Bubby Brister
riﬂing a 15-yard strike to tight
end Mike Mularkey.

Mularkey was picked up by the .

Steelers when Minnesota let him
go in the off season.

— The Vikings quickly tied the
score at seven apiece as they
capitalized on their first drive.
Minnesota quarterback Wade
Wilson sneaked in from the 1-

yard line to finish the drive.

Viking linebacker Mike
Merriweather was in the opposite
situation. The Steelers wouldn’t
pay him what he wanted, so he
sat out all last year. On draft day,
the Steelers traded him to
Minnesota.

He didn’t receive a nice
homecoming gift by the
Pittsburgh fans. When he was
introduced at the start of the
game, the fans booing rocked
Three Rivers.

Steelers

Continued from page 6

“It’s kind of hard,” said
Merriweather on his return to
Pittsburgh. “But you got to play
each game with the same
intensity. I try to treat all the
games the same.” P

Merriweather showed his
disappointment about the game
when he added a little extra shove
at the end of a tackle on Mularkey.

“I had words with Mike because
he drove my head into the

ground,” said Mularkey. “I won’t

stand for that, so I pushed the ball
into his face. I think Merriweather
was just showing his frustration.”

That wasn’t the only altercation
of the day, however. Many times

‘ throughout “the game,’ extra

pushing and shoving followed
tackles. After one Minnesota punt,
Pittsburgh linebacker Hardy
Nickerson went after Viking
punter Bucky Scribner.

Perhaps the most crucial
emotional ﬂare came from
Minnesota receiver HassanJOnes.
With Pittsburgh leading 21-14 late
in the third quarter, Jones caught

a fourth down pass at the Steeler .

18-yard line.

Jones. was unhappy with the
way Dwayne’ Woodrufl’ tackled
him, and he threw the ball into
Woodruffs face mask. The

penalty gave Minnesota a first
and 25 from the 32-yard line.
‘From there the drive went
backward and the Vikings had to
punt ‘ _
Pittsburgh's defense shut down

the dangerous Wilson all day
causing Burns to replace him
with 13-year veteran Tommy
Kramer.

The Steelers defense was led
by T im. Johnson, who had two
sacks and five tackles. One of the
tackles dropping
Anthony Carter for a 12-yard loss
on a reverse.

Johnson also deﬂected a Wade
Wilson pass at the line of
scrimmage that linebacker David
Little intercepted. Thomas Everett
added another tackle to go along
with his eight tackles.

Former Pitt defensive standout
Chris Doleman, who is now an
NFL probowler with the Vikings,
had another great game. Doleman
and his defensive line. partner
Keith‘ Millard combined for 14
tackles and three , sacks.
Doleman’s sack midway through
the second quarter caused Brister
to fumble, allowing Henry
Thomas to scoop up the ball and
run 27 yards for a touchdown.

One guy the Minnesota defense
couldn’t stop was Steeler rookie
Tim Worley. The Steeler offense
used Worley equally as a runner
and receiver‘ on the short screen
play. He had four catches for 45
yards and 12 carries for 46 yards.
One of his runs being a 8—yard
touchdown run.

Merril Hoge scored the other
Steeler touchdown on a 2-yard
run with less than two minutes
remaining in the first half.

Steelers’ Anderson kicks way into record book

Jason Hillman/T he Pitt News

With a first quarter extra point, kicker Gary Anderson became Pittsburgh's all-time scoring

leader, surpassing Roy Gerela.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, September 25, 1989

Extra point

Vaults him

past Roy Gerela as
No. 1 Pittsburgh scorer

It was an exciting day two-fold
for the Steelers yesterday. Not
only did they beat the Minnesota
Vikings 27-17, but Gary Anderson
became Pittsburgh’s all time

A leading scorer.

Anderson’s four points against
Cincinnati last week tied the old
record of 731 points set by Roy
Gerela.

With his first extra point in the
opening quarter of yesterday’s
game, Anderson took sole
possession of the record which
stood since 1978. 7

‘‘It’s exciting, especially on a
day like this when we beat such
a good football team. It would
have been a downer getting it on
day that we lose,” said Anderson.

Anderson scored nine points
on the day with three extra points

“If I could explain it I’d probably

be the head coach, and would ' I

have figured it out a couple weeks
ago,” said Anderson. “You see
that in the NFL, 21 team gets
kicked around in some garnes
and then comeback and surprise
everybody.”

What’s not surprising is
Anderson getting the new Steeler
scoring record. He was the all-

time leader in field goal’

percentage for some time two
years ago. He currently is third
on the list behind the Saints
Morten Andersen and the Chiefs
Nick Lowery. His all—time
percentage is over .770.

The Steelers picked up
Anderson off waivers from Buffalo
eight years ago. He is the seventh
leading scorer among active NFL

Race

Continued from page 6
ﬁnisher Judi St. Hilaire by 21
seconds and third-placejill Purola
by 1:37.

Not bad considering Van
Blunk had been hurt all last year
and had limited herself to shorter
races and cross-country races.

“I’m not a big road racer, so
no one really knows who I am,”

_ she said. “I came out here hoping

to be in the top five, top ten. I was
surprised I led the whole way.”

St. Hilaire, the U.S. women’s
5K record-holder and pre-race
favorite, may have provided, a
stiffer challenge for Van Blunk
had she not become ill before the
race. After about the first mile,
she was never able to close the
40-50 yard gap between herself
and Van Blunk.

In a much closer race, Jerry
O’Reilly, of Ardmore, Pa., sprinted
past Mexico’s Geraldo Alcala to
win the men’s open run, breaking
the tape in 27:55.

O’Reilly and Alcala turned
an eight-man’ logjam into a,two—
man race near the 4 -1/2-mile
mark, with Alcala struggling to
keep O’Reilly from passing.
However, O’Reilly’s superior kick
just before the six-mile mark

through Point State Park was.

enough to push him to a two-
second win.

O’Reilly, a 1989 graduate of
Villanova, was unavailable for ’

comment.
Dionicio Ceron (28:06). John

Treacy (28:09) and Rafael Zepeda _

(28:22) rounded out‘ the men’s
top live. i
Van Blunk and O’Reilly each
received $4,000 for their wins.
This year’s Great Race also

hosted the Athletics Congress
Masters 10K National
Championships. The Masters race
was open to all runners age 40
and older who were U.S. citizens.

Four-time New York City
and Boston Marathon winner Bill
Rodgers was crowned 1989
Masters champion, finishing the
race in 30:22. Rodgers, who
finished second overall in the
Masters competition, overcame a
nagging Achilles’ injury to capture
the $7,600 prize.

Kenya’s Wilson Waiga won
the Masters competition.
However, he received no money
and could not be declared
national champion because he is
not a U.S. citizen. ‘

Laurie Binder of Oakland,
Ca., won the women’s Masters
championship. ‘
Brian Laird (29:43) and
Annette Uhler (36:25) each
received the Richard S. Caligiuri
award, in honor of the late mayor
who founded the race. The award
is presented to the top male and
female ﬁnishers from the city of
Pittsburgh.

Over 13,000 participants
were expected to brave the chilly
weather to meet the 9 a.m. starting
gun at Frick Park. The previous
high was 12,807.

Other Great Race winners: ‘

Westinghouse Runners at Large

Continued from page 6
The anxious moments began

with 4:27 to go in the fourth
when Biskup nailed a 26 yarder

. to cut the Pitt lead to seven, 30-

23.

But that was all of the scoring
to be done as the Panther defense
dominated Syracuse on the next
drive and ended the game with
the Riddick interception.

Despite the victory, Pitt could
have won more convincingly as
an apparent fourth-quarter
touchdown pass from Van Pelt to
Tuten was called back by a

holding penalty.

Penalties, mostly on offense,
plagued the Panthers throughout
the game as they racked up six
infractions for 60 yards.

Gottfried felt the penalties, as
well as the three turnovers, hurt
his team tremendously.

“I was very disappointed in the
penalties. We got a score which
was called back; we were moving
on first down, and we got a late
hit call there. You can’t make
those mistakes.

MacPherson, who expected a
tough game coming into Pitt

experience.
