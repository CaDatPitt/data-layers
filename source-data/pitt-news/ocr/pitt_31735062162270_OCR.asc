Kilson concedes

Swilley Elected BASChairman

’BY B_ILL HADUCK

The Black Action Society (BAS)
elections took a surprise turn
Wednesday as incumbent chair-
man Bill Kilson conceded the
election to fellow candidate
Graylyn Swilley; ’ ’

The move came early in the

' ’?‘i“'ivproceedings as Kilson posted

/O‘

leaflets citing his “need for relief
from the personal burden of time
and responsibility,” ‘as reasons for
his concession. _

“I decided I didn’t want it,” said
Kilson, “I could be more effective
elsewhere, ' in BAS and other
places. I want more flexibility.”

  
   

GEORGE VAN Hook

Swilley, who based her campaign
on “bringing the organization to
the people,” said one of her first
moves as BAS chairman would be a
“total outreach campaign.” »

‘.‘We’re going to go to the people
instead of waiting for the people to
come to us,” she said.

Swilley had been running on a
slate with deputy chairman candi-
date Steve Daniel. The slate was
broken, however, as George Van
Hook defeated Daniel in the race
for BAS’ second highest office.

Although the situation was
unexpected, both Swilley and Van
Hook said they were “more than
satisfied” with the outcome.

“Ideologically, We’re more simi-
lar than it appears,” / said Van
Hook. “Some of the things
Graylyn campaigned about, I
campaigned about. Both of us are
political science majors,‘ and so
political orientation is in our favor.

We’re ready, we want the
students to know that We’re
ready.”

Swilley said some of the things
she would like to’ see would be a
larger active membership in the
BAS. “We’re going to have mass
registration. We’re going to try to
get membership cards to every
black student on campus.”

Van Hook agreed. “We’ve got
to let the people know they’re the

/Crisis Still With Us

  

B_Y MATTHEW KAMBIC

Pennsylvania is currently ‘in a
“touch and go” situation in an
energy problem which has been
growing for several years, accord-
ing to Pennsylvania’s Energy Chief
William Wilcox, '

“We didn’t realize how critical
it’s been becoming,” said Wilcox
from his Harrisburg office. “I
think we’ve received a_ warning
from the embargo.” ,

Wilcox said the United States
has already been feeling the effects
of an energy shortage for years.
‘‘It has not been’ possible to
establish certain new industries in
parts of southwestern Pennsylvania
because of their dependence on
natural gas." Wilcox said other
parts of the nation had been
suffering including a lack of needed
-electric power in Washington and
Oregon. r

I With the oil embargo gone,
Wilcox lists Pennsylvania’s gaso-
line supplies as adequate -but not
comfortable.‘ . Most states "are

better off than Pennsylvania, he’

claimed.

Wilcox sensed a potential prob-
lem in the false security aroused by
the‘end of the embargo.

Nixon's Okay Expected pm
For Minimum lWage Bill I

WASHINGTON . AP--Congress

sent to President Nixon Thursday a
bill raising the minimum wage
from $1.60 an hour to $2.30 and
bringing 7 million more persons
under its coverage.
' It would be the first increase in
eight years. The raises would
begin in steps oi May 1 and be
completed by 1978.

Nixon is expected to sign the bill,‘
' although he vetoed a similar one

last year. Sen. Jacob K. Javits,
R-NY,’ told the Senate that the
White House had advised that the
bill would be signed.

. At the White House, Deputy
Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren
said “the President feels that this
bill is a step in the right direction.”
But Warren added that Nixon will
not make a ﬁnal decision until the
measure is reviewed by the Ofﬁce
of Management and Budget.

he said. “And they can’t.”

While personally disagreeing
with accusations levelled against
oil ﬁrms calling the energy crisis a
hoax, Wilcox said he believed oil

Speculation on the true nature of
America's energy situation contin-
ues to flow freely, with some
suggesting the crisis is over, other
saying it never happened, and still
other maintaining it is getting
worse.

The “crisis" did occur, and with
the lifting of the Arab oil embargo
and the approach of summer, the
situation should be. manageable,
one oil company source said.

When supplies are overtaxed
and other factors increase demand,
a shortage, and potentially a crisis,
is in the offing. The situation the
United States was in these past
months and the current situation
came about this way, according to
Thomas Walker, Supervisor of
Research Information at Gulf Oil
Corporation.

“There was _a shortage of
heating oil in the winter of 1972,"
Walker said. “which was caused by
different factors. It was severe and
cold this winter, and it was
abnormally long. It extended into
the spring of 1973. Also, some
utility companies switched to
heating oil and used 200.000
barrels a day. So demand was
running ahead of supply. A

"Oil companies worked longer
making heating oil instead of
gasoline." said Walker. “This

imbalance was one of the first signs

that supplies were getting critical.
Then in the summer, of 1973 this
caused a gas shortage. This all

occured before the embargo (Arab
oil embargo) and there was no
public awareness of a problem.

Demand was up and supplies
down. ' '
Walker said the embargo

brought public awareness of an
energy problem. He noted that the
winter of 1973 was not harsh and
with the embargo lifted and oil
imports hopefully returning to
pre-embargo rates in six to eight
weeks, America’s oil
should return to the “manageable
state.”

“The public is helping to
conserve energy now that they
know the problem," Walker said.
He said long range research is
being done in other fields of
energy. including an investigation
of tapping it from salt water.

“The public is mad and they

perform.

“I get the best response from the
voters when I say. ‘I'll go to
Washington and shake ‘em up for
you.”

Denenberg felt ‘his popularity
and recognition factor was equal to
or greater than Flaherty's and
Schweiker's. “I'm also popular."
he said. “I've been speaking out
and writing articles on national
issues for years.

“-People are going to look at your
record. I've written articles about

talking about alternative energy

elsewhere, Denenberg empha- “

sized. He announced his candidacy
March 4 by asserting, “Govern-
ment is the number one consumer
fraud.”

“I think all of our social security
programs should be made respon-
sive to our cost of living."
Denenberg said Thursday. “We
have it in workman's compensa-
tion. but we ought to have it across
the board, in Medicare and other
programs. 7

“There's a lot we can do for

Medicare to provide for more
comprehensive care," he contin-
ued.

Concerning the cost of" these
improvements, the candidate said.
"When you improve something, it
doesn't necessarily cost more
money. There's a lot of fat in the
system and in the federal budget.
When some of these systems are
fixed up, you're going to save
money."

The candidate opposed legaliza-
tion in all cases of abortion on
demand, indiscriminate gun con-
trol and bussing “as a uniform
rule” to achieve school integration,
but favored lowering the legal

r~,--

drinking age to 18, and Iegalizationﬁ I

of the possession of marijuana.

“The police shouldn’t spend
their time busting college stu-
dents,“ Denenberg said. “I would
have no problem, but I’d be against
legalizing certainly the sale of
mariiuana."

In regard to organized labor’s
support, Denenberg said, “The
labor bosses are with Schweiker

convention. at the Pittsburgh‘

‘ Hilton, but I was out at the plant

BY TOM VERBISH

Pitt construction between Hill-
man Library and Lawrence Hall on
Pennant Place has put the squeeze
on motorcycle parking, according
to two cyclists who travel daily from
South Hills.

“All bike parking at Pennant
Place has been eliminated," John
Gocinski said Wednesday.

“Because of this it is getting
difficult to find a parking space.‘
Besides the Student Union parking
area, there are only a few spaces at
Langley Hall. Parking has been

~ discontinued at Benedum,”

The space between Hillman
Library and Lawrence Hall is part
of the new quadrangle construction
and will become a pedestrian mall.
It is unlikely cyclists will"be able to
park there.

Cyclist John Brizek queried,
“When the weather gets nice,
where is everyone going to park?
With the energy crisis, more and
more students who commute will
be switching to cycles this fall.

“If we're going to have to pay to
park we might as well take cars.”
Based on gas consumption
Gocinski estimated it costs him $1 a

"week to travel by motorcycle. The

same trip costs $4 a week by bus
and approximately the same by car.

Pitt Security Superintendant
Joseph Gil, involved in the campus
parking issue said, “A lack of
space has not evidenced itself to
this office. We anticipated this
response but thus far no complaints
of a parking problem have reached
us. ~
“There are spaces that perhaps
some cyclists are unaware of
behind the Graduate School of
Public Health near its garage. I’ve
been there three times in the last

- week and have seen only one or two

bikes parked there.

“Of course, the parking area of-
the Student Union is the most
convenient in terms of nearness to
other buildings on campus. A But
other spaces should be available."

_BY DAVID LYNCH
When the government sounded
_ the alarm for the so-called energy
 , crisis last fall, we were ordered to
l reduce our driving speed on
expressways to 55 miles per hour.
Allegedly, this measure would save
~a sizable amount of fuel and would
simply be a. minor inconvenience.
However, the government has
not produced any hard data
showing slower speeds alone
decrease total fuel consumption. In
fact, data on American driving
habits and the fuel-consumption-
to-speed ratio of‘ automobiles
indicates otherwise.
Our population is concentrated in
9 urban areas, where most auto-
" mobile operation is stop-and-go
city driving. Such driving is about
two-thirds as fuel efficient as
continuous high speed operation on
an expressway. Therefore, per-

haps we have the 55 speed limit for ,

reasons other than encouraging
slower driving as" a method for
saving signiﬁcant fuel.

The 55 speed limit appears to
have been adopted purely as a

‘rhetorical technique in the gov-

ernment's energy crisis propa-
ganda barrage. In other words,
those “Speed Limit--55" signs are
simply there to remind you we
allegedly have an energy crisis.

High speed driving provides an
emotional outlet ,for feelings of
“letting go" in’ our tension-or-
iented and emotionally repressive
society. Coercing people to drive
slower has the psychological effect
of instilling in drivers a feeling of
holding back, which is intended to
create,,a conservation mentality.
(In Freudian terms, the Federal
Energy Ofﬁce (FEO) is trying to
change the American driving
character from phallic to anal.)

The public does less driving
because at lower speeds the
highway experience is no longer

University for ﬁmding of the organization.

capable of the same psychological
release which motivates a sizable
proportion of pleasure driving.
Long trips at 55 miles per hour are
a bore. Perhaps, the government is
indirectly telling us to ride the
plane, bus or train instead of
driving. ’

With the end of the Arab oil
embargo and the general increase
in gasoline supply, we should
supposedly see an end to manda-

tory conservation measures, if
indeed they were ever really
required.

In fact, the ban on *,Sunday gas
sales was eliminated. However.
the Federal Energy Office says we
will have the 55 speed limit “for a
while yet," to quote them exactly.
This raises the possibility the
restriction is being continued for
reasons not exactly related to fuel
conservation.

The FEO is an arm of the Nixon
Administration, an administration
whose power over the mass public
has been nearly destroyed by
Watergate and related matters. To
have power one must control.
Regulating an integral activity in
the controlee’s daily operations is a
very effective control technique.

It serves both the foot-in-the-
door and carrot-and-stick func-
tions. Automobile driving for
Americans is an integral activity of
our society's occupational, domes-
tic and leisure patterns. Therefore
the Nixon Administration has
control of a significant component
of daily public behavior by
regulating driving, and particularly
speed and its accompanying
psychological attributes.

Control means power. One
needs power for survival, and
survival is perhaps the number one
problem of the Nixon Administra-

tion at the present time.

Regardless of the reason for the
low speed limit--be it a manipula-

The newspaper business fascin-
ates me, as do the people in the
business. Since I am a veteran
newspaperman myself (three cruel
and interesting years) and plan to
be a newspaperman for some time
to come, my feelings are under-
standable.

This accounts then for the sheer-

joy I had the other night when I
received a call from Clara Bellum, a
buddy from way back.

Clara, who majored
activities at a large eastern
university, turned to joumalis_m
when she got the third degree--
from the police, not the school. She
felt journalism would allow her to
expose many things about this
cruel world. O

»Having worked for a small-town
newspaper for several years, Clara
has her own share of experiences in
and problems with journalism.
Back in town for a few days, she
thought she would ﬁnd a sympa-
thetic ear in the person of me.

with a sigh. “I love to write, but

tive tool for Nixon’s benefit or
alleged fuel conservation--the
American public is being improp-
erly regulated by the government
through this measure.

This country was founded on the
principle of minimal direct gov-
ernmental intervention into the
lives of individuals. Driving at
unsafe speeds so as to endanger
others‘ lives is a ‘proper form of
governmental regulation, but lim-
iting speed in the interests of fuel
conservation is not.

In areas where the low speed
limit is enforced, it is one more
excuse for police harassment.
Many otherwise lawabiding and
safe drivers are unnecessarily
penalized. The legislature intend-
ed license points to represent
unsafe driving, not one's propen-
sity to allegedly waste fuel. ’

If we assume fuel conservation is
a virtue, low speed limits are unfair
to small car owners. The owners of
\such cars have already drastically
reduced fuel consumption by
driving a vehicle which has double
to triple the fuel efficiency of most
American cars. In fact a
Volkswagen gets better mileage at
75 than most American cars do at
55. Why should small car owners
be forced toidrive slower in order to
conserve fuel for the gas guzzlers?

‘The most effective fuel conser-
vation program would be a purely
voluntary one in which consumers
realize substantial economic bene-
fits by practicing conservation
measures which will best serve the
particular interests" of individual
consumers. T

Since consumer behavior is
directed at maximizing self inter-
est, one's motivation to conserve
will increase in direct variation with

Letter to

Dear Editor,

On March 27, 1974, the
Union
made the following demand to
Student Government. We feel the
university community should be
aware of this demand through the
press, as issues concerning women
often get lost in bureaucratic paper
shuffling.

The UWU, in behalf of the
struggle against sexism in aca-
demics demands the election of
Homecoming Queen as part of the
Homecoming ceremonies at the
University of Pittsburgh be abol-
ished. .

The reasoning behind this
demand followsi

Problems of Journalists

“Basically, this adolescent aca-
demian charged me with failing to
address myself to great world
problems, such as the psycho-sex-
ual frustrations experienced by
pubescent political science stu-
dents,” she said.

“Furthermore, this mere whip-
per-snapper of a man claimed that I
have only been published because
my family bribed the managing
editor with piroghies.

“He even criticized my writing
style,”. Clara said. “This _comes

inches!
capabilities--it is to laugh.”

I had not yet heard such a tale of ,

woe’ from any fellow journalist as
‘Clara had _told. I thought I had
things rough. -

“I'd say this boy had but two
problems, even though it would be
tempting to say they number more
than the stars in the sky and.grains
of sand on the beach." Basically, he
is serious, and liberal,”
concluded. F
i I did my best to cheer up my
friend, and succeeded to some
extent before we had to hang up
and tend to our separate news-
paper duties. I_ promised Clara I’d
inform my readers of the problems
we journalists must face.

I knew you’d understand.

1) The Homecoming Queen is
elected as representative of Uni-

she projects in this role is false,
destructive and dehumanizing.

'2) The existence of a Homecom-

members of the University com-
munity--both male and female. .

3) This trite ritual serves
absolutely no purpose in the

 Wi|lie's   Real Dynamite,-
Not Just Another ‘lick  

BY M. C. PILECKI
Maybe‘it's iust becuase there
has been such a dearth of really
great movies lately but sometimes

. a ﬂick you don't expect much from

like Willie Dynamite, turns out to

‘be a lot better than it should be.

Willie seems to be another one of
those ‘so-called blaxplqitation
ﬂicks, long on gall and short on just
about everything else. The title
character is a black- New York
pimp--with all the color and
extravagence that implies--who
insists on independence from the
controls of other pimps and cops.

The film has everything you’ve
come to expect from the black
ﬂicks: extravagant costumes ant.
sets, jiving music, beautiful bodies
showing lots of skin, the grossest
over-acting since the Cecil B.
DeMille epics and as much subtlety
as the average pimpmobile.
Usually the films are more like
spectator sports [if you have a
really good audience], and the
movie itself becomes a bore if
you’re not cheering for one side
over another.

Somehow Willie goes beyond
that. Sure, the first half is ﬁlled
with the usual fun strutting around,
but before that wears too thin, a
real story begins to unfold. This
isn't the usual,‘ Superﬂy-type epic,
glorifying the black criminal, nor is
it a goody-two-shoes moralizer.

\ Willie’s [Roscoe Orman] tightly

controlled world starts to fall apart
around him, with the help of
competing pimps, the long arm of
the law and a -reformed hooker
[Diana Sands] who tries to get his
stable to revolt. It isn’t the usual

pimp film. Willie is presented both ~- vi  I Hi’ 

sympathetically as a colorful black
man scratching for everything he
can get in a white-controlledworld,
and also as _an exploiter of black
women.

There is no condemnation or
gloriﬁcation, iust an insightful
delving into a too often stereotyped
character. Besides the usual
extravagant adventures, the ﬁlm
covers something of his family
backgroundjn a visit home, and his
personal involvement with one
favorite member of his stable, the
delicate Pashen (Joyce Walker).

The second central character is‘

Sands’ Cora, the one-time hooker/
junkie now trying desperately to
get her sisters off the book. She is

in direct opposition to Willie, but 

cannot hate him and, in time, feels
a certain empathy with his
hardships‘.

Willie Dynamite isn’t a really
deep provocative drama. Perhaps
if it weren't for the late Diana
Sands’ exceptional performance,
the ﬁlm would just be another
forgettable black epic. But
somehow it does succeed in making
a point, gently and with painstak-
ing care.

The black studies department at

"the University is a five Vflaf Old

suffering some growing pains. but
growing nonetheless.

Enrollment in black studies
courses.jumped from 729 students
in its first year [1969] to 2,525 for
1972-73, according to Assistant
Professor Curtiss Porter.‘ The
winter 1973-74 time schedule lists
4l'black studies courses.

The ‘department. which has no
graduate programs. boasts 35

-undergraduate black studies ma-

iors this year. as opposed to two in
1972-73. the maior's first year.
Two professors noted at least half
the students-in their eourses'are
white.

-According to Assistant Professor
James Karioki. “The only thing

" holding us up is lack of a chairman.

You spend so much time on
’administrative things. when
there's other work to do.‘

Currently Anne Jones of

1

the

T School of Social Work is,the black

studies department acting chair-
person. but a live-member Exec-
lutive Council decides administra-
tive matters until a.permanent
chairperson is appointed.

The black studies major must
select one of four divisions within

_the department: black humanities,

black social science, African

studies or Caribbean studies,

according to-the CAS Information
Bulletin. The major must take four
courses in a major concentration
within his selected division, and
one course in each related
concentration within the division.

‘-s A maior must also‘choose one

course from each of the remaining
three divisions. and one elective
black studies course to make up 30
credits in the department. Of
‘these. only six can be taken
Credit-No Entry.
The image of black studies as a
collection of easy courses is refuted’
by faculty members. “A student

--vwutv-.

   

/

who comes into my class with that
image will be very disappointed,”
Karioki said. ’

Assistant Professor Emmanuel
Anise claimed some black studies
faculty members insist on too high
an'academic standard for black
students. The problem is that
we're dealing with an institution
not completely free fronrracism
and its implications. If you're
trying to counter that. the strategy
of enabling students to ‘negotiate’
the system is a positive one.

“.The other side of the argument
which I would endorse is that most
likely the graduate will go back to
serve one or another black
community. .. ‘

"When we let them slide by
what we will see is black people
viewing these graduates as being
trained ‘to solve their problems.
The black graduate won't be in a
position to solve_ -their problems if
he has a degree without content.

"The individual will not admit
this because he needs the iob. and
he will become a debilitating factor
in community problems instead of
an asset.

“I know the professors in black
studies are not into easy A's at the
University of Pittsburgh." said
Porter. "In no case is it easy in
black studies. with an obvious
exception or two among the courses
offered. ' '

"I would guess that at least ﬁfty
percent of our. majors are double
tnaiors." Anise said.

Indeed, according to the CAS
"Bulletin of Information, seven
traditional academic departments--
anthropology. economics, english,
history, mathematics, philosophy
and speech lcommunicationslu
maintain less rigorous policies
regarding Credit-No Entry than
does, black studies.

Six more departments demand
less than the 30 credits black
studies requires for the maior.

Curtiss Porter: “I know the professors in black studies are not into

began, according to Porter, as a
response to demands by the Black
Action Society [BAS] in 1968.

“Those-demands basically con-
sisted of a demand for more black
students. faculty and staff at the
University." Porter said. “as well
as the establishment of a relevant
program of black studies and a
special recruitment effort to bring
in more black students.

“Representatives of the Univer-
sity agreed to establish a black
studies program. which was done
in March 1969." _

Black studies here is a depart-
mental model. to its advantage.
according to Porter. “This
program from its inception has
been a faculty department in CAS
and not an adiunct center.

“This program is recognized
across the nation as the primary
model for black studies as an
interdisciplinary department."

The three best features of the A

program. according to Karioki. are
(1) its universalism. the diasporie
model of. as Porter calls ‘ it.
“African people wherever you find
them in the world." primarily
America. the Carribbean and
Africa (2) the diverse backgrounds
of the faculty. and (.3) a concern
with the community.

“The primary aim of black
studies." Porter said. “is to
establish it as a discipline. Our

primary emphasis for the black
studies degree is graduate educa-
tion to further the black studies
program and add skills to it."

iln response to the problem of
what to do with a black studies
degree, a question asked. with
increasing frequency by holders of
all liberal arts degrees, Porter
knew of no specific disadvantages
black studies graduates have
encountered because of their
major.

“Personally I don't emphasi‘/.e
vocational training since my
priority is furthering the discipline
through graduate education." he
said.

The idea of black studies as a
faddish discipline. growing out of
and remaining dependent on
student activism of the late sixties.
is not supported by the faculty.

“Part of student response to
courses is faddish,” Anise said.
“When black studies came on the
scene it was new and interesting.
When it began to settle down,

We should be, and are less crisis
oriented." .

“In a number of my courses I
have an average of more white
students than black." Anise said.

‘'I don't know why studentsitakei

certain courses. My guess is that
they register based on what they
perceive to be relevance based on
course titles. not necessarily on
contents."

As a five year old. black studies _

is growing. “We've shown growth
every term." Porter claimed.
"Faculty activity reports show
similar growth on the part of
individual faculty members."

“One critical problem may be,”
Anise said, “the behavior of
predominantly whiteinstitutions in
the face of a lack of funds from
Harrisburg.

"The test will come as to the
level of their commitment as an
answer to this historical bias: will
the University of Pittsburgh reduce
funds for black studies as funds for
the University are reduced‘?

“We have been taking the same.

standard reductions as other CAS

experience difficulties because it is

young."

Black studies here is not beset by
the common problems plaguing
similar programs, such as de-
creased enrollment and charges of
a lack of academic integrity, but is
troubled by internal faculty dis-
agreement on some administrative
matters, including an unresolved
tenure and promotion policy which
is to be decided on by April 30.

"The worst problem for me

of the turbulent 60’s.

studies came along for ffrontier’
students.

"A new. generation of. black
students have come to Pitt under
regular recruitment and for them
you have to sell black studies like
any other department as having
something to provide for the
future.

"The future of black studies\

depends on its educational content.
if it is sound. it will stay. if not. it

will die." “Black studies came
out of a crisis,” said Karioki,
“because this society is _held

substance to black studies than its

policy  Porter said- “is _a
question of clarification of the role
of a faculty member in the black
studies department.’ The Univer-

sity has to clarify its stand."

“I think divergencies among the
faculty were stated around the
concerns of individual members. H I
think those concerns have been
satisfied."

“Eight instructors have been
here for five years." Anise said.
"Given the University's policy. a
decision must be made by the end

of next year to either give thenr

tenure or ask them to leave within
one year. How does a University
deal with that kind of dynamite’?

“There is an institutional bias
against Africans in the department
based on the debate over the value
of people with academic training to
the department.

“People without advanced de-
grees are threatened——they're
scared. There is a fear among
people who don't have the skills in
research, or don't want to make the
commitment to get them by getting
advanced degrees that they’ll lose
their iobs."

Porter disagreed. “Every
individual faculty member in this
department either has a PhD. or is
pursuing one.

“I question the status of that six
year deadline. It seems to be in
flux because of financial cutbacks
which could result in fewer people
being tenured.

“We expect to be able to present
to the University a package that
details professional development in
black studies. Whether it will be
inside or outside the existing
system is in question because that
system itself may be questionable.

“To me the most valuable person
in terms of certification would be
the individual who had a PhD in
black studies._

“The research skills gained in
pursuing advanced degrees are
valuable ones, but the question is
whether other skills have as much
value or more. Anything has a
value to the extent that it
contributes to a discipline.”

“Lack of PhD's among the
faculty is a hindrance in terms of
perception, but it's not really one,”
Karioki said.

_ what will

“We should have an equivalent
method of evaluation for a PhD.
We should have other measure-
ments of people's abilities, such as
if someone is a good teacher.

“However, we have to aim for
excellence and achievement. Just
because a person doesn‘t have a
PhD. that's no excuse for medi-
ocrity.

“If I have to put my finger on
be decisive for black
studies. the department will make
it or fold on what happens
internally," according to Anise.

“Black studies will be
established by its

ability to assimilate
and realize an
essentially African

way of viewing
the world."

“The internal argument was that
there are people in black studies
who want to make it a traditional
department, when it should be
relevant to the community. I
haven't met someone to deﬁne
what that means.

“My view of black studies is that
it is in the business of meeting
black people’s educational needs
only. The only way black studies
can be efficient and dynamic is to
specialize.

“We have to decide what we will

specialize in. Given the resources

not be able to meet the needs of

one component alone. In the
educational component there is
much that we may have to

specialize within the specialty.
“There are many black agencies
serving needs which black studies
cannot. such as those focusing on
discrimination in employment.
Black studies does not only face the
problem of trying to overlap, but
also the problem of overextension

of our resources and capabilities."

“Black studies needs to go in the
direction of excellence not only in
terms of academics, but in terms of
practical solutions,” he said.
“We're moving in that direction,
but not as quickly as I’d like to.

“We need more research, to
publish more, and to get our
students involved more with the
community. For example, Barbara
Hayden (a black studies instructor)
runs a day care center in which
students work there as part of a
practicum in. a two term child
development course. I'd like to see
more of this, though you have to
strike a balance between traditional
academics and practical involve-
ment."

“The task is to uncover that

himself in a bartering oflaughs and
greetings with his drummer Spider
and Chris the pianist.

Eric rested a hand on my
shoulder, tipping his head toward
the sound of my voice as we talked
between sets. “Well, jazz is
self-centered. but at the same time
extra-giving. I play because the
music is there and I want to be a
part of it. It’s a creative force.” he
said, pressing the palin of his hand
to my collar bone, “It’s a creative
force that will keep the world
together. When _iazz is right.” the
hand left my shoulder, the head
shook, “it’s sacred.”

Eric stands in front of Spider's
percussion. fumbling for the
microphone. When he ﬁnds it. he
lifts the end of the sax.’ puts the
reed to his lips and a whining
"Ain’t No Sunshine When She's
Gone" saturates the bar. The iazz
finds its break and Eric leans back.
With a slight moustache twitch and
head tilt. he lets the piano run with
the music.

He sits on a stool behind the
mike. the sax riding between his
legs. His head still follows the
music. ttirning a circle. or tilting a

the audience together. Some
nights people just aren’t with it or
something...or you just can't get on

nights when I don't think I’m
playing anything. people come up
and tell me how good I am.”

Later. Spider was to boast the
fame of this combo at Sonnv
Dave's. and confess their obscuritv
in their home town.

Eric continued. leaning back in
his chair. and resting his arm on
the wooden table top. “Thev're

Eric cupped his hands. “Right

That’s the difference between us

do?"

'‘I dunno." said Chris. “But it's
like the theatrics take over the

Eric would say he picked up the
sax when there were no more
trumpets. When did he pick up a
trumpet‘? He never did. “I used to
dream aboutplaving a French horn
and a trumpet that was connec-

At Kresge Theatre

Living In Bliss: ‘Hay Fever’ Time

BY ADRIAN MCCOY
With the current wave of
nostalgia sweeping over us, it
seems ﬁtting someone should come
along with one of the sidesplitting
escapist comedies that used to be
standard fare 30 or 40 years ago.
Carlow College's Kresge Theatre
presents us with Hay Fever, Sir
Noel Coward's comedy on life in
the late 20's-—an entertaining
production showing us the way we
never were.
" Hay Fever, directed by Kathleen
George, is a day in the life of a
wacked-out bourgeois family, the
Blisses, who are “rusticating" in
the English countryside. Mrs.
Judith Bliss (Patricia McCarten) is
a retired actress married to David
(Daniel Frezze), a writer of bad

novels. They have two children. a
daughter Sorel (Christine Verto-
sick) and a son, Simon (James
Berry).

A great dramatic conflict arises
when each member of the family
invites a guest down for the
weekend. Sorel invites a stiff-
backed diplomat [Joseph Keenan],
and her mother brings in an addled
young boxer [David Kasper], who
keeps up a conversation by saying
“Rahther!” to almost every line
directed at him. Simon invites a
vampish socialite, Myra [Suzanne
Hall], and Mr. Bliss introduces a
mindless flapper [Suzanne Verto-
sick]. This small mob is_ waited
upon by the Bliss’s bemused
house-maid, Clara [Catharine Rob-
inson]. ’

talking and playing that keeps us
going. Unity is still there no matter
what questions either one of us
asks. It goes beyond where we're
coming from, and yet it is where
we’re coming from. To be one with
my question and my answers..."

“You can't get the answers,”
interiected Chris.

“Well, Icould write a tune and it
could be a question, and I could

write another tune and it could be,

an answer.

“Yeah, I guess you're'right._"I

“Right. Well, right now I'm into

ing out what other people are into.
Maybe some things they say will
add to what I know.

A cymbal is ringing and it sounds
like an alarm clock. An Eric
original, “Children of the Morn-
ing” swells. The sax carries a
light, easy melody, with piano and
bass following. The piano takes on
the quality of chimes to melt with
Spider’s bells, hung around his

neck, ringing as he moves. The
music finds its break, as all Eric’s
songs do, and the drums come into
their own. Spider can be seen
bouncing and banging at those
drums behind Eric’s straight body.
The sax is lonesome and hopeful at
the same time.

“You didn't make me an
obiect," Eric stressed before I was
to leave, “so I won’t make you an
obiect." He laughs.

viewed played games with you

do that everyday to survive. I’m
not saying I never play games. But
I don't’! like myself when I do.

Sometimes everything seems plas-
tic and I feel like the most plastic

‘son of a bitch around. It’s a heavy

frustration to feel like that.

“Were you getting all this
down?" He smiled, tugged at a
Blue shirt sleeve and twitched one
end of his moustache. “OK, read it
back to me.”

“Probably '

The result of this
mixture is an evening of chaos and
confusion. Everyone lounges
around the sitting room. saying
Clever Things and trying to ward
off the inevitable boredom. They
seem to say exactly the wrong thing
at the wrong time. which sets off a

series of absurd arguments, lasting

as long as everyone remembers
what the argument is about.
When their attempts at social
conversation fail, they try to play
parlorgames. But even the games
fall apart and new arguments start.
A guest who has been out of the
room returns and asks if it is a new
sort of game. In a way it is.
Life itself is an elaborate game
for these people. When one of the
guests accuses them of constant
play-acting and refusing to be

sincere, they don’t seem to hear it, ’

possibly because they don’t want
to. There is always a serious note
behind Coward’s savage humor.

The 20’s costumes are as
beautiful as they are historically
accurate. The action is set against
a wood-panelled sitting-room
complete with piano, enough
ﬂowers to fill a hothouse, and a
token Laittrec print on the wall--all
the trappings of the social strata
Coward satirizes so well. The room
seems to say, “Look, we have
taste.” ,

The actors are a little stiff,
especially at first, but the pace is
tight and precise. They never
move too quickly for the audience
to catch the sophisticated humor of
the lines, and they never hang onto
a laugh too long. They manage to
bring off the exaggerated and false
sophistication of the characters
with real ease andgrace.

If you're-looking for an evening

Junior Joe Kantor will be playing
in the number one slot, a position
_ he's held since freshman year. The
 Carnegie native was 6-3 last year,
and 16-5 for his career.

if Juniors will also hold down the
number two and three slots, and as
Webster's crop of 1971 freshmen
mature, he expects big things out
of them.

Tom Current, who had a great

The Current-Dieffenbach duo is

hoping this is the year they’ll put
things together. ~

Webster emphasized the po-
sitions could change drastically in
the next few weeks. “We haven’t
had much time to practice because
of the bad weather, so l’l| go with
the veterans for a while,” said

.Webster.

“We do have a surprisingly good
crop of freshmen who will be

‘BY RICK STOUFFER
Pitt is sponsoring a develop-
mental soccer clinic tomorrow ‘at
the Stadium beginning at 9:30 am.

Newton Costa Di Miranda from
Brazil will be the featured guest.
Miranda is coach for the University
of Bahia and is also a rules
interpreter for the sport.

Pitt's soccer coach, Leo Bemis
said the visit is part of a cultural
exchange program between the
United States and Brazil.

“It seems Pennsylvania is a sort
of sister state to the University of
Bahia whereby we send basketball
coaches to Brazil who speak no
Spanish and they’ send us soccer
coaches who speak no English.
Surprisingly despite the language
barrier, everything works out very
well.” I y-_.

“Mr.Miranda has held clinics so
far in Erie and Slippery'Rock but
this one will be the biggest yet,”

‘ Bemis continued.‘ “He has been a

guest of the WPIAL and the

collegiate soccer coaches of the’

area." His American sponsor is
the National Intercollegiate Soccer

' Ofﬁcials Association. A

Invitations for the clinic have
been“sent to all soccer clubs, high
school and college teams in the
area. Beginning tomorrow morn-
ing the clinic will feature three
areas of concentration including

fundamentafs, goal tending ideas »

and the how to of the corner, side,
beginning kicks, etc. Following the
three groups a demonstration will

After lunch three more clinics ‘-

This will include formation and

ﬁlm entitled “Pele, the master and
his methods."

“This is the first really organized "
soccer clinic in this area but we
thought the need was here,” Bemis.

' said. “Since World War II’ soccer

has been growing by leaps and

E bounds in western Pennsylvania.

It’s a very simple and economical
game to play and you don’t have to
possess any great athletic ability to
compete. '
“Most colleges in this area have
soccer teams now," Bemis contin-
ued. “Now even thehigh schools
are picking up on the game.”
There will be no charge for the
clinic and it is open to the public.

  Fighting Not Over

CARACAS* Venezuela A'P--
Heavyweight champion George
Foreman, defeated challenger Ken

Norton and both ﬁghters‘ handlers A

were held in Caracas ‘today in a
dispute over payment of taxes.

“Everything is in chaos," said
Bill Biron, a Norton backer. “The
promoter has left town, leaving us
with a lot of bills and commitments.

We have wired the United States
urgently for $100,000 to get us out
of the country. We understand
Foreman's group is doing the same
thing."

Meanwhile, the head of a
Caracas travel agency who said he
was owed $160,000 went to court to
have the sophisticated television
equipment of Video Techniques,
lnc., impounded at the airport.’

Video Techniques, —-with head-
quarters in New York, sponsored
the title ﬁght here Tuesday night in
which Foreman defended his crown
by stopping Norton in the second
round. ’

Henry Schwartz, executive vice
president of Video Techniques",

\ .

flew back to New York Wednesday. 4

 

“He left owing me $160,000,"

-said Eddie Blackwell, director of

the Tortuga Travel Agency.

“We have impounded his truck-
at the- airport.” .

Foreman, guaranteed $700,000,
and Norton, guaranteed $200,000,
were promised that their purses
would not be taxed if they fought in
Caracas. But Biron said a legal
technicality prevented inclusion of
the clause in the tight contract.

“However, I have a dozen
witnesses who will testify that we
were guaranteed no taxes."

Biron said the "Venezuelan
government was demanding 18% '
of the ﬁghters’ purses and a
percentage of all television re-
ceipts. He said that could require a
“sizable bond, especially in the
case of Foreman whose purse was
much larger than ours.”

The fight was marked by
repeated threats by both sides not
to go through with the bout. As a
result, the closed-circuit television,
which was supposed to provide the
bulk of the revenue, was reported
to be a ﬁnancial disappointment.

It's a golden year for hockey in

Boston but,. ‘from all present

indications, Beantowners will be

celebrating it in silver--the silver of
the Stanley Cup, that is. —

The Boston Bruins are en_ioying
their Golden Anniversary this year
by "turning the pre-season predic-
tions of the so called “experts”

into the biggest joke of the National '

Hockey League campaign.—

Back in September, the Bruins
were picked by very few to rebound
from the raids of the World Hockey
Association, which knocked them
from their championship perch the
previous year," and some writers
had the nerve to declare this the
year Boston wouldn’t even make

the playoffs.

In 1972-73, the then defending
Stanley Cup Champs lost four key
personnel in the birth of the WHA.
Number one goaltender Gerry
Cheevers, John McCenzie, Mike
Walton and Derek Sanderson all
found the money greener on the
other side of the ice and, as a
result, Boston ﬁnished a dismal
season behind Montreal in the
running for the Prince of Whales
Trophy and was eliminated’ in the

Stanley Cup quarterﬁnals by New
York. _

Sanderson returned from the
WHA in the middle of the season
but the club's main problem was
the lack of a consistent number one
goalie. E..l. Johnston (now a
Toronto Maple Leaf) just wasn't up
to the task of handling the load
Cheevers had the year before and
Ross Brooks and Ken Broderick
proved to be only dependable
backups. '

That problem was resolved by
the Bruins’ management last
summer when they gambled on an
inexperienced, unproven NHL
prospect. Sending veteran Fred
Stanﬁeld, point on the awesome
Boston power play, to Minnesota
for goalie Gilles Gilbert has been
another in the long line of “steals”
the Bruins have pulled off.

Gilbert never had the chance to
prove himself with the North Stars,
playing in the shadows of the crafty
veteran Gump_ Worsley and the
over-rated Caesar Maniago. Given
the chance in Boston, Gilbert was
the starting netminder for the East
back in .Ianuary’s All-Star game.

Knowing the potential of Gilbert,
Boston coach Bep Guidolin scoffed
at the September selections.

“I don't buy that fourth place
garbage,” Guidolin said at the
outstart of the year. “And for
several reasons, I think we have as

~ good a shot as any team at winning
the East.

“We had the best crop of rookies
in camp that the Bruins have had in
the last five years," he continued.
“Everybody seems to think our
goaltending won’t stand up. I feel
differently."

Not only have rookies such as
Dave Forbes, Al Sims and Andre
Savard come through with solid
seasons to match Gilbert's all—star

leader Phil Esposito is hot on the
way to break his own scoring record

and the always superlative Bobby .

playoffs against the Rangers last
year, wasn’t supposed to be back at

“Golden” Bruins Stanley Cup Favorite

weaken the Bruins in penalty
killing (Sanderson led the league in
the last full season he played with
eight shorthanded goals), but this
year he was absent from the_lineup
most of the season due to iniuries.

Still, with all the talk centering

"on the brawling Philadelphia Flyers

and their recent domination of the
West Division, Boston is the
favorite to bring the Stanley Cup
back to the Hub.

In the quarterﬁnals, the Bruins
will handle the Toronto Maple
Leafs in no more then ﬁve games.
Second place Montreal will take the
New York Rangers on the basis of
the home ice advantage. New York
can't win in Montreal.

In the West, Philly won't have
much trouble with Atlanta (if they
can hang on to fourth place) and
the Los Angeles Kings don't stand
up to even an off-year Chicago
Blackhawk squad.

Crossing over for the semi-ﬁnals,
it will be Esposito against Esposito
but Tony has always been a ﬁsh at
the hands of Phil & Co. Montreal
will eliminate Philadelphia ‘on

BY RICK STOUF F ER

A clear-cut answer to the
_. question whether money should be
g appropriated for a'new Field House
7. now or retain the old one for a few
more years could not be found in a
in survey of students taken along
"Bigelow Boulevard.

In the poll of 50 students, 32
"ifavored the new facility while 18
believed it was not needed.

‘ Most of those polled who favored
the move gave as their reason the
same idea basically summed up by
David’ Cain. a senior studying
URBAN AFFAIRS.

 "There is not enough room for
’ all the people-" The facility is too
small and iust outdated."

Tom Thompson, a sophomore in
pre-pharmacy. brought out a point
for"a new Field House generally
overlooked. “The old Field House
is not only too small but I think it
is also unsafe in case of a big ﬁre.
If a tire did break out I think a large
crowd could not get out safely
because the exits are too small and
most are locked."

 Students Undecided On
   New F ieldhouse Idea

‘Kevin Dunn, a senior in
economics, looked at the problem
in terms of recuiting. “I think_we
definitely could get better recruits
for basketball with a new Field
House. The general pride of the
players would probably increase
with a new facility. Right now it’d
like playing in a bread box.”

On the other hand. the people
who did not favor a new Field
House believed “money could be
spent on better things." Karl
Baldys. a senior English maior
summed the problem up in these
terms. "The money should go to
more worthwhile things. such as
the English department. And look
at the Hockey Club. It's an athletic
organization but it can't get money
from anyone to stay in existence."

A few of those polled thought the
present facility could be renovated
including Gary Slagle. a sophomore
in political science, “The basic
structure is adequate. I think. If it
was renovated. with more seats, it
would be okay."

to do with the decision. “I don’t
think we can tell if we need a larger
facility because you can’t tell how
teams will do in the future."
The survey was taken Wednes-

The survey revealed at least 10
people polled had never been in the
Field House or knew where it was.

Sanguillen,

SARASOTA, Fla. AP--Southpaw
Jerry. Reuss pitched all nine
innings and Manny Sanguillen hit
an inside-the-park homer Thursday
to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates to a
6-1 exhibition baseball victory over
the Chicago White Sox.

Sanguillen's homer skipped past
centerfielder John Jeter, who tried

for a sh_oetop catch. It triggered a ’

three-run ninth inning" burst off Jim

The Pirates also scored three
runs in the sixth on a triple by

BUFFALO, N.Y. AP--Con-
sistency and concentration, says
Coach Jack Ramsay, are musts if
the Buffalo Braves expect to turn
back the Boston Celtics in the
National Basketball Association
playoffs.

The teams open their first-round.
best-of-seven series Saturday night
in Boston.

Despite the Celtics‘ 22-2 edge
over Buffalo during the Braves’
four years of existence, Ramsay
feels, “We can do it.

“We must do everything well
and with consistency,” he said
before putting the Braves through
a long practice Thursday. “That’s
the key, consistency. When we
lose that we can get in trouble.”

Ramsay said he has come up
with several new offensive wrinkles
h.e will use against the Celtics, but
no drastic changes are planned.

“We're going to stress the

‘things we've stressed all along,

and that's mostly concentration on
individual assignment."

The Celtics, with a 56-26 season
record, defeated the Braves four
successive times this season. Then
Buffalo trimmed the’ Celtics
124-104 in late February and 110-94
two nights later.

by Jim "Catﬁsh" Hunter, Ken
Holtzman and Vida Blue and
backed by bullpen aces Rollie

What's more, he's also got the

career Floyd collected 1,725 points, H

Peabody star with such former
Pittsburgh schoolboy stars as Ken
Durrett and Maurice Lucas.
Durrett went on to star at LaSalle
College, Phila. and now is in the
National Basketball Association.

.Lucas was the key to the 1974

NCAA runnerup Marquette team.
Paul Litwalk, who coaches
Cummings at Johnstown, and
whose team played against Ben-
nett, said of the pair, “give me
Cummings and..Bennett and three
imposters and I’ll win."
Thirty-two members of the
University of Kentucky Boosters
Club cam e to Springfield to watch
the 6-9 Batton against Radnor. He
entertained them with a '34 «point

performance as Springﬁeld won .

64-62. Both Batton and Floyd have
been rated in some areas among
the top ten scholastic players in the
nation. He averaged 25 points and
16 rebounds per game.

Wright at 5-8‘/2, would have to
stand on a ladder to converse with
his all-star teammates. Instead he
delivers his message with a slight

of hand performance that keyed

Abington’s drive to the Class A
champignship. He was the star in
the final against Peabody, twice
scoring driving layups over the 6-6
Bennett. Wright scored 23 against
Peabody, and convinced many
doubters that _he’s one of the best
ball handlers on high school
basketball. He runs the ofﬁce like
a coach on the floor.
