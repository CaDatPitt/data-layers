in Air Corps Production Tonght

A collection of original song hits, a few’ old gags. with new twists, and .some downright

good amateur and professional talent answer the curtain -call tonight‘ for the Air Co1'p’s own

musical comedy, “The Lid’s Off.”- ‘ , _
The production is under the able direction of A/S Mike Kievman, a Hollywood and
Broadway groomed star, who isnow training with the 60th CTD at Pitt. Under A/S Kiev-

man’s whip hand, the boys of the corps have worked every evening for .the last three , .
weeks on the comedy show. The boys have stayed up past taps and have sacriﬁced school

S Bill Byers’ Sinatra-like handling of “Mail

Master of Ceremonies for the show is A/S Sam
Diamond, a recent addition to the cast, who jokes his way
through most of the evening. Diamond’s “Slapsy Maxie
Rosenbloom” countenance and_his snappy handling of the
gags steal the show. Aiding Diamond in some of the more
important comedy scenes is one of the script writers, A/S
Bill Wallace. Diamond, Wallace, and a couple of the other ‘
boys go through a dance routine in one’ of the barracks
scenes that has a “ro1l-’em-in-the-aisles” touch.

/A

In a serious scene, A/S Kievman
steps from his role as director to
read the contents of a letter while
it is done in pantomime on the
stage. The letter is a moving ac-
count of an_ aviator’_s feelings while
in a battle area. The scene blends
‘into singing-star Judy Malone’s hit
number, “Evening Star.” .

Script for the musical comed
was written by four Air Crew men:
Air Students George Boyden, Bill
Wallace, Marty Fessler, and the ver-
satile Mike Kievman. Lt. William
Levinson assisted in production of

the show‘ and acted as advisor for
it. He will have a “front row seat"
at tonight's performance. The pro-
duction is being presented through
the kind permission of Major Earl
A. Bartholomew, -

place in the auditorium, followed
by an informal gathering in the so-

This-is only the second time a Feb-

gelo, Pitt Queen in 1929, will pre-
side over the ceremonies. She will
be attended by members of the

cille Morgan, C, xwill serve as

Barbara Ackerman, C, as Mercy;
and Lois Westbury, C, as Justice.

Women’s Self Government Associa-
tion, is Alma Mater and Eleanor
Segelhorst, Ed, is Father Pitt. In-
coming freshmen women will be

' surrounded by their Senior Men-

tors, members of the Traditions

Committee, ushers, and ﬂame ..’-1:z-:ar- »

ers. Georgette Zinsser, C’46,\‘a’nd
Garnet McMarlin will act as stand-
ard bearers.

“Although the usual ﬂame, Pitt's
Light of Truth, cannot be used in-
side the building. the program will

Lantern Night," Barbara Grouse,
C, chairman of the Traditions Com-
__',mittee, assured the student body.

which  meet‘ at the‘ Philadelphia

Last year when "the -government

used for rminting new pennies. His
new appointment has also to do
with‘ work with coins.

“-'1‘hefunction of the commission,”
‘Dr. Amos said, “is to make tests
, with reference to‘ weight and ﬁness
of certain coins ‘that “have. been ‘re-
served by several mints through-
out the practicing year, to determine
whether there has been conformity
to the requirements of the law.”

Social Science
Degrees Given
To Twenty-Eight

Pitt’s School o'f Applied Social
Sciences graduated twenty- eight
students yesterday. The commence-
ment exercises over which Dr. Bow-
man presided, took place in the Ste-
phen Foster Memorial Auditorium
at four o’clock in the afternoon.

Earl Grant Harrison, Commis-
sioner of the United States Immi-
gration and Naturalization Service,
addressed the graduates on the
sity of Pennsylvania, a member of
visory' committee and over ﬁve
ters were in attendance. The school
held this separate commencement
because a need for trained social
workers has put it on a wartime
speed-up basi-s. ‘

The twenty—eight graduates com-
prise a very wide selection of un-
dergraduate schools, including most
of the prominent universities_ in
-this country. One student, Paul
Schreiber, holds a doctorateof jur-
_isprudence from the University of
Berlin. Four other students hold
special Red Cross scholarships for
social work. ‘~

Fifty members of the school’s ad-
visory committee and over ﬁve
hundred members of the boards of
directors of ﬁeld instruction cen-
ters will be in attendance. The
school is holding this separate com-
mencement because a ‘need ' for
trained social workers has put it
on a wartime speed-up basis.

Study hall on Wednesday and
Saturday nights is quite popular
lately. This change is undoubtedly
due to the AST’s desire for a quiet
place to study, but we don’t see
how they can enjoy neither saying
a word nor smoking a cigarette for
three hours. They also seem to en-
joy reverting to childhood ways, for
when they do something naughty
they immediately start writing, "I
will be a better boy,” or “I will not

fall asleep again” ﬁve hundred‘

times. The fame of the study hall
is spreading too, for even the
“Meds” and “Dents” have been us-
ing it. The part that baffles us most
is that they waste time calling roll!
The light snow on Monday was

. just the impetus necessary to re-

vive in A Company a yearning for
practice in tactics, cover, and~co1i-
cealment. When falling out for
military period, late-comers had
to use maneuvers not unlike those
used on the inﬁltration course to
pass the hail of snow on the steps.
Some decided to remain on Lilly
Court v ﬁghting to the end, and
the air was white with the prac-
tically harmless snowballs. All
came to a peaceful end when time
came for the formation, even if
there were no negotiated peace
terms. a ' ,

laughter shake the Nixon rafters
unceasingly until the very end.
Betty Ann Nyman as Corliss,
Walter Gilbert and Violet Heming
as her father and mother, and Gene

Fuller as the uncombed boy friend
play brilliantly to bring out every
speck of humor. This humor is the
result of a mistaken pregnancy
situation, and the implications con-
cerning Corliss and boyfriend Dex-
ter are nothing less than‘ devastat-
ing. ‘

.Audience’s receptions of “Kiss
and Tell” might easily form the
basis for a commentary regarding
the psychology of some prevalent
forms of stage humor. Father Day
in “Life with Father” brings a roar
every time he shouts,-
DAMN.” Father Archer shouts at
one point in the proceedings that
someone is a so - and- so, and the
audience explodes, ﬁsts beat rail-
ings, thighs are slapped in ecstacy,
etc.

‘Well, , whatever the psychology of
laughing at immoral implications,
made more funny in “Kiss and
Tell” by a misunde’rstand_ing,v the
fact remains that "audiences laugh.
One of the ushers remarked, “If
they won’t laugh at the second act
they won’t laugh at anything”?

Gloria Strook and Gaylord Ma'-
son as the young lovers, Billy Ny-
man as the little brother, the Prim-
ble parents, young Dexter’s par-
ents and the remainder of the cast
give excellent performances.’ ’

By JEANNETTE FELDMAN

Pitt men in service are indirectly
teaching both geography and his-
tory to students andprofessors _on
the Pitt home front by their letters
from the most remote parts of the
world.

Major Larry Bachman, who
graduated from our M e d i c a 1
School in 1934, writes from Italy
that he can hardly believe that he
has now been on active duty for

‘ almost two years ' and seven
months. After nine ‘months at
Camp Lee and nine more at In-
duction Stations throughout Vir-
ginia,'he was assigned to the 22nd
Quartermaster Truck Regiment
as regimental surgeon. He says,
“We sailed to Africa on the heels
of the invasion forces. Good old
Casablanca; we know it like ,a
book!” Major Bachman comments
that although most of the men in
his group picked up a little French
while in Africa, they are gradual-
ly losing that and speaking Ital-
ian, which they are ﬁnding “less
idiﬁicultgto learn.”
Recently graduated from O. C. S.
at Camp Davis, North Carolina, Lt.
George Chirigos is home on a ten-
day leave. George graduated in the
September class of ’43 as a Political
Science major. His activities at
school varied from Managing Editor
of the “News,” member of Druids,
John Marshal, Pi Tau Phi, Pi Sigma
'Alpha, to ROTC, and Pitt Riﬂes. Af-
ter the war, George wants to come
back to Law School, and we at Pitt
hope that is soon.

On leave from Camp Haan, Cal-
ifornia, 1st Lt. Howard Schwartz
stopped at school thisweek to see
old friends and former professors,
and to secure information about
transferring some of his credits
toward a Master’s. A member of

the General‘ Staff at Camp Haan,
Howard has’ been spending "most"
of his time in the desert. While at
Pitt, he was interested in govern-
ment service subjects. Immediate-
ly after -his graduation in May,
’42, Howard received -his commis-
sion as a-2nd Lt. in Army -Anti-=
Aircraft. Howard commented that

he was delighted to be back, but

“my professors as well as my

From somewhere overseas where
he is stationed with a Medical Unit,
Pvt. Tom McIntosh Writes, “I am
now farther away from Pittsburgh
and Pitt than ever before. Despite
the distance, I still foster a multi-
tude of pleasant memories of the
University. I am one of thousands
of Pitt men awaiting the day when
we can resume our studies at the
school that means so much to us.”
Tom graduated from‘ the School of
Education in 741. He and Bill Kelly
used to spend much of their time to-
gether.

"Maybe We’ll Place
With Pitt basketball coming down the season back stretch,
we might speculate a little on the remaining games. Bethany
I has a Navy stocked squad which has been going great guns
against district competition. The Bisons were to bode evil for
_ the Panthers last fall in the Stadium but disappointed every-
one including themselves when they failed even to score a

1’ point. Basketball season has changed the complexion entirely
' as Bethany College has produced an experienced quintet, one

that will give Pitt plenty of trouble. The two West Virginia

‘ games are enigmas. Morgantown’s prides and joys havebeen

up and down, won some tough games and dropped others con-
' sidered easier. Scotty Hamilton, Mountaineer forward and
for the last few years a thorn in many a Pitt fairly unblem-
ished side, must have graduated as he showed up as a member
of West Virginia's backﬁeld last fall but has not appeared as
a member of their present ﬂoor aggregation. The away game
' with Penn State at State College should be a revelation. After
a couple of years of this same type of game between the same
schools, anything could happen, and it had better, if the “fans”
who support the games are to be satisﬁed.
What Is A Good Game?
, Pitt's very exciting game with Westminster last week
C brought to mind again the question of whether a good game
,is thrilling or well played._Disbelievers in Doc Carlson's hold-

A "em-down policy with regard to State's stiff zone defense ap-

plauded when the Panthers almost confuted Westminster’s in-_
._ gvincibility. It was supposed to be a good game, either interest-

ing or well played. It certainly wasn't both. Three things can

I .. be said of the State game: Pitt's score was low; State’s ‘score

- was low; the game was dull, just the opposite of the Panther-

 /Titan scrap. In the Westminster game there were many mis-

‘cues, more wild passing, more frantic attempts at long shots,
but the ﬁnal minutes had the spectators on the edges of their
seats. Penn State and Pitt both were cautious, concentrating
on accurate passing and guarding each other so closely that

' . the game was well played but drab. Which is the better game
' ' --when the Dodgers and Pirates battle in a 10-8 slugfest, or

when Ripisewell shuts out the Bums ? Is a" game good because
it's wild and exciting or close and well played?

Doctor Carlson is noted for his variety in. handling pe-

 - ,culiar situations, and the State defense certainly’ could be called

just such a situation.
Lately, though, most athletic contests have taken on bi-
...zarre aspects to,“please” the fans. Spectators rave over the
performances of six-feet-eight and nine-inch giants whose
only asset is height and basketball teams that are so tall they

.- , can safely throw inaccurate, looping passes instead of hard,

fast ones indicative of better coached teams. Reputations of
“power’-' football teams draw attendance of people who want
to see a scoring massacre. It all boils down to the question
'asked of ﬁfty million Frenchmen and an equal number of

 "American sports fans: can they all be wrong ‘Z Freak exagger-

  ations of athletic contests will do no sport any good. The rabbit

ball took much of the closeness out of baseball which formerly

ii’-“had relied on playing skill, the basis of all competition. Re-

 formation of a game doesn’t necessarily mean the game has

Calls Meeting

Baseball remains at Pitt for this
year anyway. There will be a squad,
says Coach Ralph Mitterling, one
that will be formed around only ﬁve
holdovers from last year's squad.
Baseball started at Pitt in 1939 un-
der the guidance of Athletic Director
Jimmy Hagan and has continued
every year since.

Intensive practice and condition-
ing will start in a few weeks with
the remaining ﬁve forming the nu-
cleus._A1 Wettengal, a catcher, Joe
Kielb, catcher and outﬁelder who
was also quarterback for the foot-
ball squad last fall, Jim Reber,
number two starting pitcher last
season and a tackle on the football
team, Bob McKee, outﬁelder and
brother of Bill McKee, number one
hurler of last year, and Jack Citron,
who had to drop from the team at
the beginning of last season be-
cause of work, are the boys who
will be the start of this year's great
“unknown.’_’ Many of the football
players are supposed to be ﬁne base-
ball players and these are expected
to report Monday afternoon. Quite
a few of the boys in school have
played high ‘school and sandlot ball
and would make valuable additions
to ‘the team.

The schedule hasn’t as yet been
"set, butpten or twelve games are
anticipated. ‘

Panthers will Try To Herd
Bisons In Stadium Clash

By Herman Feldunan .
Navy or no Navy, Doc Carlson’s proteges hope to stop

the Bethany Bluejackets in their initial meeting of the season

tomorrow night at the stadium. The Little Toughies will face

something of a district all-star team in the Navy-packed.‘a - ,

gregation which is representing Bethany in its first year of
big-time competition. Records indicate that they are a rather
fair team though somewhat erratic.

The Bethanyites boast a split with Camp Reynolds, thev 

same with Geneva and Wash.-Jeff. The Panthers, on the other

hand, defeated Geneva twice, the scores indicating a tough._

ﬁght but deﬁnite superiority. At present the Bethany per-

centage is little above ﬁve hundred." Coupled with thefact 
that the local boys will be playing on the home ﬂoor, ever-y_-"

scalp to its impoverished victory

the Bluejackets will display unex-
pected ‘ form. '

Despite the horde of Navy train-
ees which’ has nearly taken over
the college, Bethany boasts. one
honest-.to-goodness c_ivilian_ on the
team, Captain7Bill Alexander. How-
ever, he ‘may not play-' tomorrow
night because of an injury. "Four

from Wash.-Jeff. College. It will be
remembered’ that last year's W’ &

ry Knoche is, at six-feet-four, the
tallest manon the team. He is a
probable starter. (That's a hopeful
sign-—no seven‘-foot giants to bother
with.) Three members‘ of the team
are from Westminster. (The New
Wilmington team has stopped the
Toughies four times in a row. That
can’t go on forever.) Several other
West Virginia and Pennsylvania
colleges are represented by the
Bethany personnel. Coach John

terial of his coaching career at his
disposal. As far as he i-s concerned

Riﬂe Team To
/Shoot Next Week

. The University Riﬂe team is prac-
ticing at the Stadium range for a
series of forthcoming matches. The
ﬁrst meet will be held with Montana
State University on February 19.
A tentative schedule has been set
up and challenges issued.
Head coach is Maj. Merlin Wills,
.assisted by Captain John Bricker
and Sergeant Phillip Cox. Major
Wills became the head of the Mili-
tary Science Department, upon the
promotion of Colonel Kelly to Com-

’ mandant of Troops stationed at the

University. Captain Bricker, B.A.
'38, was recently transferred here
as assistant professor to Major

' ( Wills after serving in Panama. The

’ freshmen and

 -however,

daily practice sessions are conduct-
A ed by Sergeant Phil. M. Cox, known

. , to ROTC men as the master of the

’.supply room. Sgt. Cox reports that
. 25 men have turned out for the
team, the majority of whom are
sophomores. The
Coaching Staff wants it understood
that the team is open to all men and
" is not conﬁned to the ROTC. If there
are any undiscovered “-Daniel
' Boones” lying around who would
like a chance to shoot for their

-— school they are to report to Sgt. Cox

at the Riﬂe Range any afternoon

4 ‘.1 hetween3and 5.

Although most University teams
representing the minor school sports
have been dropped for the\duration,
the riﬂe team functioning under
government supervision has been
kept on. In the past the riﬂe team
has-been one.of the top teams in

S, the country and has placed consist-

ently in the Hearst Tournies. In
the last few years, because of stud-
ent neglect, the team has been rele-
gated to a minor position. This year,
with most competing
sports “suspended, there should be a

deﬁnite improvement in interest

and performance.

Frets Swim At
Trees Gym Meet

Announcement of the rules gov-
erning the forthcoming lnterfra—
ternity swimming meet to be held
on February 22 at Tree’s gym was

_made this week by LM Director

Mike Josephs. Chairmanned by Jos-
ephs, the meet promises to be one
of the season’s intramural high-
lights, with teams from most fra-
ternities on campus expected to be
present at eight o’clock on that
Tuesday evening.

Competent oﬁicialing of all
events is assured by Mr. Keppler
Miles, ASTP and Air Cadet swim-
ming instructor, and Mr. Clarence
Douglas, physical instructor at the
Downtown YMCA, as referee and
judge, respectively.

Events on the program calculated
to try the fraternity mermen are:
160-yard free style relay (four

“ men), 40-yard breaststroke, 40-yard

‘freestyle, 40-yard backstroke, 120-
yard medley relay (backstroke,
breaststroke, free style), and a 20-
yard underwater swim. Scheduled
to climax the evening’s contests is
a 20-yard swim,- freestyle, in which
each contestant is to be clothed in
a shirt and trousers. Entrants for
the latter are advised by Mr. Josephs
to bring their own clothes for this
event. ’

Rules are simple, allowing a max-
imum of two men from any organ-
ization to be entered in each event,
and limiting each competition to a
maximum of three events. Scoring
will be on the basis of ﬁve points
for a first place, four points for’a
second, and so on to one point for
a ﬁfth place. i

All entries must be turned in to
Chairman Josephs on or before Feb-
ruary 15 or may be ‘submitted to
Bob Burford on or before that date.

Part of the -extensive new intra-
mural set-up, the swimming meet
promises to provoke much discussion
among iraternity men and inde-
pendents alike.‘ The judges will an-

’ nounce the meet winner on the same

night. . V '

Many teams are already getting
in condition with regular practice
sessions in preparation . for the
meet.

A thrilling 22 to 18 overtime vic-
tory with Pi Kappa Alpha last Wed-
nesday on the Trees Gym ﬂoor gave

the Sigma Chi undisputed posses-

sion of second place in the Interim-
ternity Basketball League and deﬁn-

itely dampened any title aspirations C

the Pi Kappa Alpha may have held.
It was largely through the elforts
of Pager and Massey, with 8 points
and 7 points respectively that Sigma
Chi came through on top—Pager’s
two goals in the extra period de-
ciding the issue.

At the same time the Phi Gamma
Delta five moved into first place,
half a game ahead of Phi Delta
Theta, with a 2-0 forfeit victory
over Alpha Phi Delta. The defeat
dropped the Alpha Phis into a
three-way deadlock for third place

with Pi Kappa Alpha and the Delta.

Tau Delta. The title race appears
now to be narrowed down to a fight

between the undefeated Phi Gams. \ 

and Phi Delts, and the once-downed
Sigma ‘Chis. '

Bringing to a close a highly suc-
cessful season, the Chemical Engi-
neers and the ME 82’s meet this
coming Wednesday, February 16,’
in the first of a three-game series

to decide the champion of the En-

gineering Basketball League. The
tipoif is scheduled for‘ ﬁve o'clock
on the Trees Gym ﬂoor. Both teams
are undefeated. The Chemical En-
gineers, however, have more victor-
ies to their credit due to the fact
that the ME 82’s did not enter the
league at the start of the season.

This. plus the fact that they are
for the most part upperclassmeni

while the ME 82’s are a» freshman

group should make the Chemicals a ‘

slight favorite. The dates of ' the
ﬁnal two games will be announced
later by Mike Josephs, the mana-
ger of intramural athletics. '0

. From delicately blown miniature animals to large
’vases—that ‘is the range of ,the varied glass collection owned" by Dr.

-of chemistry at the University. This

‘of modern glass in‘ the entire world from the standpoint of art and

' echnology,

  Dr. S_iIverman’s impulse for glass

,fihef was wbrking in a glass factory.
=iSince that time he has developed

'this.hobby and is today recognized

ollection, Dr. Silverman visited

‘?giiy'o£ the world’s largest glass
,,centers.’?Among them, the Val Saint

”gi'um,‘ Stevens and Williams in
??Stourbridge, England; Daum"s fac-
‘ ‘try at”N,ancy, France; Moser’s in

aarlsbad, Czecho-Slovakia; and
the various factories in Murano,
near Venice. In this way, he was

,:,able to purchase many valuable

‘pieces directly from the manufac-

. .t_urers., His collection does‘ not, how-

“The American glass industry has
a greater scientiﬁc personnel than

that of the glass industry of ‘any i

other nation,?’ Dr. Silverman writes.
“Great leaders in the ﬁelds of plate

production, and art glass, realizing
their hopelessness in Europe, have
come to America. They are working
for us. They will help us to enhance
further _the _science, the art, the
technology of glass 'in‘ America and
to insure American leadership for
the future‘. America’s glass products
will help to rebuild post-war Europe
and to restore happiness to its peo-
ple. Am'erica’s glass will insure post-
war security at home as well,” Dr.
Silverman predicted.
