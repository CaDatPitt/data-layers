Student Affairs Office
Orders Frat Probation

BY TOM SMITH ,

_ A controversial decision by
Director of Student Activities Dan
Meloro has put Delta Sigma Chi on
probation for a semester-effective
September 1 for violating an
orientation regulation prohibiting
alcoholic beverages at open frater-
nity p/arties during the Orientation
period. .

By being placed on probation
Delta Sigma Chi is prohibited from
participation in any intramural
‘activities; participation as a mem-
ber of IFC and all the related rights
and privileges; application by
individual chapter members for an
IFC emergency loan fund; parti-
cipation in any campus program;
sponsorship of any event, program
or individual; extension of bids to
new members; and initiation of
members.

Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Moye ordered last
year that alcoholic beverages not
be permitted at the fraternity
orientation parties. That decision
was reaffirmed this year.’

-.“Very embarassing headaches
developed in the past as a result of
drinking during orientation,"
Moye said. “It did not enhance the
program or the objectives of
orientation. lt did not present the
image of the University to the
freshman in a favorable light."
Jacqueline Mullens. Director of
Orientation agreed. “The ‘no
drinking directive provides for a
better atmosphere for a freshman
orientation." ‘

Beer was on tap at the June 18'
Delta Sigma Chi party, according to.

Dina Natali. Advisor to the
Interfraternity Council and the
Panhellenic Association. Com-

plaints were filed the next day with
Mullens.

Faculty Groups Join U nion Race

By scorr MACLEOD

Pitt faculty members could
choose a collective bargaining
agent in an election as early as
December 1974, according to per-
sons involved in the current un-
ionization process.

The predictions follow the re-
cent action of three faculty or-
ganizations who filed, motions’
with the Pennsylvania Labor Re-'
lations Board (PLRB) to inter-
vene in the union election peti-
tion of the Pitt Professional Un-
ion. (PPU) “

As a result of the motions. the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors (AAUP). Pennsyl-‘
vania State Educational Associa-
tion (PSEA) and Pitt Law Facul-
ty Association can join the PPU
in the hearing and election pro-

cess which could ultimately lead ‘

to the naming of a collective bar-
gaining agent to represent Pitt
faculty.

In petitioning the Board. the
PPU claimed; 1) that it had
collected authorization cards from
30‘); of the members in an “appro-
priate bargaining unit.” as defin-
ed by the PPU. and 2) that an

election should be held among_

those members to name a collec-
tive bargaining agent of their
choice.

The PPU contends that it has
received ca rds from 30 %—the per-
centage required by law before
an organization can call for a col-
lective bargaining election— of
the members in a group of Uni-
versity employees. This “appro-
priate bargaining unit-” as spe-
cified by the PPU. consists of
faculty in the provost’s area. li-
brarian, and graduate assistants.

Pitt’s administration has dis-

agreed with the PPU definition.

of the “appropriate unit.” claim-
ing that all faculty. including

Expansion and renovation of
Pitt's intramural and recreational
programs should show, marked
improvements in six areas by
September. according to Student
Government Board President Mike
Furick.

F urick, a member of the Ad Hoc
Committee on Intramural and
Recreational Sports which was
formed last winter to discuss
remedies for Pitt’s lagging spare
time athletic programs, said work
has already begun o_n several of the
projects with more to follow in the

ensuing weeks. N‘
“We've already started work on
the paddleball and handball courts

In addition. Furick said. “things

Arsenal staff two days before the

head of Arsenal J. Steele Gow:

“...therefore. the March 8 notice of
termination which you received can
be and hereby is rescinded." Gow,
Dean of Pitt's School of General
Studies, also announced admini-
strative control of Arsenal will no
longer reside in General Studies.

Meanwhile, State Senator Frank
Mazzei (D.--43rd District) intro-
duced legislation (Senate Bill 1773)
making funding for Arsenal a line
item in Pitt's annual appropriation
from‘ the State, renewable each
year. The $100,000 allocation to
cover maintenance and operating
expenses July 1, 1974 to June 30,
1975 passed the State Senate (49-0)‘
Monday and moves to the House
for action later this week. Mazzei
said he expects the bill to pass
without difficulty.

Mazzei and a team of State
legislators including Senator Stan-
ley Noszka, one of the bill’s
co-sponsors, and State House

.Appropriations Committee Chair-

man Eugene Scanlon had been
investigating long-range funding
alternatives for Arsenal since late
April. The search was sparked by
local citizen protest spearheaded
by the Center’s Mother’s Club

Pitt’s decision to close the facility.

Pitt Bags $518 Million
In Early State Budget  

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Pitt administrators are pleased
about his year's early passage by

“the state legislature of special

appropriation including the Uni-
versity's $51.8 million allocation.

Goaded by what ‘many have
described as fear of public anger
over partisan squabbling, the state
legislature sent Pitt’s budget
sailing to the Governor’s office
after paring the allocation from
$58.9 million to $51.8 million.

Executive Assistant to the
Chancellor Charles R. Coble
described the prompt passage of
allocations as ‘‘great".

“It's hard to say what broughtit
about. it was mainly the internal
processes of the legislature.”

lt’s the pace they set for
themselves. Generally it is true
that non-preferred programs have
been late, and you can’t put your
budget to bed until you know what

The Pitt News and the Student
Government Board (SGB) signed a
‘one year contract yesterday pro-
‘viding for monthly audits ofthe Pitt
‘News ﬁscal records and a three
member arbitration board to review
I the ‘ paper's grievances.

A The contract, effective July 1,
l 5-1974, is binding on all student
‘ governments and all editors and
‘ business managers of the Pitt News
until June 30, 1975: At that time,
 terms of the contract will be
open for re-negotiation.

The SGB and its Allocations
Committee granted the Pitt News’
‘budget $27,000 for the ﬁscal year
-1974-75, guaranteeing the Pitt
News freedom to spend funds
without restrictions in those areas
of the approved budget.

,—-‘The Pitt News must notify the
Student Government Allocations
Committee (SGAC) in writing, at
"least fourteen days in advance of all
"expenditures not listed on the
budget. If after being notiﬁed, the
,lS_GAC considers the Pitt News’
proposed expenditure a misuse of
Student Activities Funds, the
SGAC may appeal the issue to an
arbitration board composed of the
Director of Student Activities, one
undergraduate student selected by
the Pitt News, and one under-
 graduate student selected by the
'. SGAC. This board has the ﬁnal

 ' posed expenditure.

rMacI.eod has mixed feelings about
fthe new contract. “I think the
-;contract is reasonable, that is, at
least it’s something both Student
Government and the Pitt News can

According to MacLeod, the

\‘ ._contract lacked the quality to serve
as a solid, responsible foundation

Pitt.News and the SGB.

SGB President Mike Furick is
satisﬁed with the contract, es-
pecially with the formation of the
arbitration board. “The ﬁnancial
control Student Government has
ov_er_ the Pitt News will merely
insure that Student Activities Fees
are not abused. Nobody will
' exercise any editorial control over
the Pitt News," Furick said.
“Whenever the Pitt News believes
it is being wronged it can appeal to

committee will decide on the basis

Under the terms of the contract,
a monthly audit of the Pitt News
ﬁscal records will be conducted by
a joint committee composed of one

member and their respective
organizational advisors. If irreg-
ularities resulting from negligence
on the part of the Pitt News staff
are found, the SGAC will take
corrective measures according to
its Hearing Policies and Proce-
dures.

The Pitt News is bound by the
contract to print three issues of the
newspaper weekly during the fall
and winter terms and two issues a
week in the spring term. Thirteen
thousand copies per issue of the
newspaper will be printed in the
fall and winter terms, while only
6,000 copies per issue will be

‘printed in the spring term.

State Monies Save Arsenal Center  

(Continued from Page 1)

Official announcement of the
Harrisburg allocation was made
Tliesday by Vice-Chancellor for
Budget and Planning Jack Free-
man, although the Chancellor’s
executive assistant Charles R.
Coble, withholding details of the
matter pending official release of
the announcement, assured Mon-
day’s Senate Council meeting that
“an equitable solution to the
Arsenal Center situation has been

‘arrived at which’ will allow it to

remain open at least for this year.”
Dr. Arnaud was unaware of the
official release of the details until
the Pitt News spoke with her
yesterday at 1 pm.

Although which administrative
body Arsenal will be attached to is
currently still ‘under debate,
sources close to Arsenal speculate
the Center will probably shift to the

‘School of Health Related Profes-

sions (HRP) and its department of
childcare and child development.

the move Dr. Arnaud favors. HRP
Dean Anne Pascasio, however,
conﬁrmed the ﬁnal decision on
future administrative control of
Arsenal was as yet unmade.

Relief and pleasure character-
ized the University's reaction to the
Arsenal appropriations. Gow
called their situation “better shape
and more stable footing ﬁnancially
now than they ever have been."
Dr. Arnaud praised the “concerted
action at many levels. The staff at
Arsenal is extremely pleased. It's
a beautiful illustration of what
concerned parents and legislators
working together can do."

Dean said, “I’m cautiously
excited until I hear the remainder
of the news. I understand the
$100,000‘ is renewable each year,
but I’ll wait until we have it for
sure. What I’m wondering is will
Pitt continue the faculty support
after this year.”

Arsenal Center has a long history
of ﬁnancial crises and almost-
forced closings. Resolving a

similar crisis in April 1971. as
reported in the April 5, 1971 Pitt
News,. Posvar at that time
committed the University to “fac-
ulty support at existing levels” for
ﬁve years (approximately $86,000
per year at that time) “on the
condition that outside sources are
found that can commit a funding
level of $80,000 per year for the
next ﬁve years for staff salaries
previously funded by the Medical
School and the School of Health
Related Professions." The Med-
ical School at that time was
removing itself as administrative
head of Arsenal.

Arsenal was established in 1953
by then-Pitt faculty member Dr.
Benjamin Spock, as a facility to
study the normal development of
children, and has since functioned
as a training center for childcare
specialists and daycare center for
Lawrenceville children. Some 45
pre-school and 60 school-age
children and their families are
currently enrolled at-the Center.

mature,” said Richman. “There is
no clear indication from the fac-
ulty that they favor a union.”

Richman cited a polling con-
ducted recently by the AAUP of
100 faculty members —— university
wide. He claimed that 40 favor-
ed a faculty union. 40 were
against it, and 20 were not sure. 0

“Inflation has not yet hit peo-
ple and tenure cases only involve
a few individuals personally.”
Richman said, noting a few typ-
ical factors which usually influ-
ence faculty judgement when
deciding the issue of collective
bargaining.

Although the local AAUP mem-
bership will not officially define
an “appropriate bargaining unit”

until an August referendum, Rich- .

man said heapersonally felt the
AAUP would argue for three sep-
arate units.

Differing from the administra-
tion’s view that all faculty be in-
cluded in the proposed unit, Rich-
man said thelmernbers might be

for graduate assistants, a unit for
faculty in the provosts area, and a
unit for members of the health re-

As do his competitors. Rich-

” man feels his own organization

is best qualified to represent Pitt’s
faculty; “We’ve been at Pitt for
30 or 40 years. It is no accident
that Pitt has basically AAUP’s
tenure rules. The other two
(PPU, PSEA) are interlopers. ”

The PSEA,,who in January be-
came the newest orgainzation to
maneuver for faculty support. also
feels it is best qualified and will
win an election.

“First, we have talked.-to facul-
tv who have expressed their sup-
port,” said Cornfeld. “And sec-

ond. we have the ability to do the"

job. We have the best staff. the
largest staff, the most clout, know

fining an appropriate unit, also

“More time was needed to

said. “The basic organization
had to be done— the faculty had
to consider the possibilities.”

He added that at many schools.

filed. that is, when a petition is

collective bargaining is voted
down.
Hearings conducted by the

PLRB, which would be presided
over by a hearing examiner. will
probably begin at the end of
August or beginning of Septem-
ber. according to Trump. a
spokesman of the PLRB.

At the hearings, the dif_ferent
groups, including the administra-
tion. are expected to argue their
definitions for an “appropriate
unit.” According to Trump. the
hearings could last one day or
longer, and the election. provid-
ing that Pitt would qualify after
the hearings, could be within a
fw months gfterwards.

   

Presently. there are three
groups of faculty where the dif-
ferent organizations and the ad-
ministration differ in their defini-
tion of an “appropriate unit.” They
are faculty in the health related
professions. graduate teaching
assistants. and the Law school
faculty.

Vice chancellor Cheever of the
health professions reported ‘yes-

terday that the sentiment in the 0

health areas was similar to the

position taken by the administra-'

tion: that faculty is faculty and

a unit should not break off the

faculty in health professions.

And the Law School has fil-
ed a motion with the PLRB claim-
ing that it “seeks to intervene in
this proceeding for the purpose
of urging that the faculty of the
school of law are excluded from
the unit proposed by the peti-
tioner and not be included with
any other faculty for reasons ad-
vanced and accepted before in
both state and federal Labor
Relations Boards.”

   Pitt Easing Shortage of   I
 Married Grad Apartments

.1

 
  

BY IRENE SCHMIDT

Help» is on the way for married
Pitt grad students troubled by the
shortage of adequate on-cainpus
housing. The University is inthc
process of creating 14 new
apartments exclusively for married
grad students inside the boarded-
up windows of an old brown house
at the corner of Oakland Avenue
and Seiinott Street.

“We’re hoping to open the
building by September 1,” said

Assistant Director of Housing
Ronald R. Cowell. “But that’s on
the basis of the contractor’s

statement, and at present all we
can do is accept applications. I
really can"t promise that the place
will be ready for occupancy at that
time.

"We will accept _applications
from married uiidergradu_ates. but

That's where the greatest demand
is right now."

The new apartments, at 219

nished for $155 per month
including all utilities and unfur-
nished for $140 per month
including utilities, with each unit
having a separate livingroom,
diningroom and kitchen, and all
including range and refrigerator.
The occupants must furnish car-
peting and drapes. A one-month
security deposit is also required.

"Well. you know what old

about the time schedule.

The building has been vacant

Senate Council Airs Probation

BY TOM SMITH

Student Government President
Mike Furick has labelled “unfair"
the Office of Student Affairs
decision to put the Delta Sigma Chi
fraternity on piiobation for serving
beer at an open Orientation party.

Furick included the issue in his
regular student report to inform the
faculty and administration of SG
opposition to the decision.

“Orientation is the time when a
lot of student organizations.
especially fraternities. recruit new
members." commented Furick.
"The administration passed an
edict saying frats could not have
beer at the parties during
Orientation." '

Criticizing the decision to put the

fraternity on probation, Furick
said. "Delta Sigma Chi was
slapped a heavy sentence by

Student Affairs. The administra-
tion dropped the atomic bomb on
them."

Furick also disagreed with the
decision because the administra-
tion did not utilize the judicial
process: “Why has the University
spent thousands of dollars and 3%
years developing the judicial
process?” he asked.

“Are students to be judged by

administrators and faculty or are‘

they to be judged by their peers? It

plained the decision to the Senate
Council. "Last year with the
drinking." he said. “there were
many questions from the parents
worried about this‘ kind of
permissiveness."

Marcus defended the decision not
to utilize any judicial process: “We
really did not think it was germane
in this instance to'go through a
judicial process. They did not
comply with the regulation. They
admitted they had the alcohol. so
the decision was made by Dan
Meloro, Director of Student Activi-
ties. to put them on a year's
probation.

“Fraternities, after all, exist at

-the pleasure of the University,”
‘Marcus added.

“Dr. Moye’s
reason for not going through the
judicial process was that it was an
administrative decision not to
permit the ‘drinking. The mechan-
ism of _a University censure was
believed to be in order.”

In reference to Furick's claims the
Campus Judicial Board should
have been used. Marcus said.

“The Campus Judicial Board h-as

no jurisdiction over matters of this
type. You would have a point with
the IFC Judicial Board because it
has been the traditional adjudica-
tion source‘with frateriiities."

‘In other business. Executive
Assistant to the Chancellor. Dr.
Charles Coble reported the Arsenal
Family and Children's Center
would remain open: “We are not
at liberty to disclose the details
because of press release agree-
ments." he said. “but I want to
reassure this body that ail

equitable solution to the Arsenal

Center situation has been arrived
at. which will allow it to remain
open for at least this year."
Coble also informed the Council
the Pitt Professional Union [PPU]
notified the administration June 18

-that itihad a bargaininggunit. He

commented, “We believe the
union should include all full time
faculty members of the Univer-
sity.”

‘Coble. substituting for’ Provost
‘Rhoten Smith. also referred to the
passage of Pitt's budget by the
State Legislature. Pitt was
appropriated $51.7 million instead
of thet$58.9 million requested.

 Tale of Horrors 

The recent decision by Dan Meloro. Director of Student Act;vi-

_ arlcellor of Student Affairs and in agreement with Alden Bowen.

dicial Board. ~

The Office of Student Affairs said they could decide the com-
_aTnt filed with Jacqueline Mullens, the Director of Orientation
I use the actions of Delta Sigma Chi were in violation of an ad-
’ ‘trative directive from Dr. Moye.

j;The decision will effect the students who are members of the
al chapter. No students, including student government board mem-
,ers.“‘.who are the elected representatives of the students at Pitt, had
 input whatsoever intothe decision-making processes; Furthermore.

embers of the Student Affairs staff such as Bill Marcus, Dan Me-
 I" and Alden Bowen, have stated fraternities exist at the pleasure
the_.University. .
,, The controversy followed a decision made last year by Moye to
rohibit beer at fraternities during orientation because it was not
iicive to a good orientation program. The idea that students
 t be protected by their administrative-superiors and that they are
,_ le..to be responsible forvtheir own actions seems foreign to the at-
rriospliere. an urbanized University in the ’70’s. ’ '

N’evertheless,,it is frightening that administrators, who are the
,_-’rect" superiors of students entrusted with the activities of students
 ampus would use such arbitrary authority in making this kind
' ‘cision.

’ Itjis quite clear despite legal arguments which can be made to
ontrary that-Delta Sigma Chi has not been treated fairly in this
tance. A formal hearing was not held.’They do not know who their
users are and they have not been guaranteed the right of due pro-

’ /

"Though the fraternity has admitted to Meloro that beer was on
he premises they do not agree with the punishment that has been
"a“’nded.— down in the form of an administrative edict. They should
the right to appeal that decision with the ‘xpectation that they
,_il receive a fair and impartial hearing. It is this which Delat Sig-
 hi is beingdeprived.

4 _, he decision according to Meloro can be appealed to his sup-
rior_~Dr. Moye. However, Meloro made the decision inconsultation
nd with the approval of the vice chancellor of Student Affairs.
'“ " has already said he agrees with the decision and that he pro-
would uphold the decision if it were appealed. Is this a fair

..The argument that no judicial board has jurisdiction in this case
a ridiculous one. Though the Student Code of Conduct constantly

_.er-sfto the rights and responsibilities of students. and rather stud-
 ,s;_as' a whole. Furthermore,'the argument on the part of the admin-
,,r,at'ors that it was not within the scope of the Campus Judicial
' "d because it involved organizations as opposed individual
tudents is preposterou. Alden Bowen, himself said, “I wouldn’t
‘ant to say whether organizations do not fall under the code.” Stud-
,.organizations, whether they be fraternities or groups recognized
,b Student Government, are composed of students. When those or-
izations are denied rights and privileges of the individual student
mbers are denied those rights and privileges.

,~For administrators to say that none of the operating judicial
‘stems have jurisdiction in this instance is an admission of failure
in their part to_ develop a fool proof judicial system to provide stu-

_tS due process and insure the rights of students, provided for.in
e Student Code of Conduct and J ud-icial Procedures.

-Additionally, we agree with Mike Furick, Student Government
resident, that if the present systems had no jurisdiction a temporary
udicial board could have been established. The Student Code of
duct and Judicial Procedures provide for this when it says, “How-
r, in extraordinary circumstances where the complexity of factual
‘sues and/or matters of law so dictate, the Chancellor may appoint
ad hoc hearing body to hear cases. Any proceedingibefore such
;;a ad hoc body shall provide due process and insure the rights of stud-
s.” But, this assumes that students who are members of the student
rganizations are,subject to the Student Code of Conduct which the
;Office of Student Affairs refuses to admit. _

 Furthermore, what is even morefrightening in this tale of hor-
._ro_r's relating to the Delta Sigma Chi incident is the attitude shown
‘by our Student Affairs administrators, who say fraternities exist at
he pleasure of the University and implicitely that all student organi-
ationsexist at that same pleasure. Students involved in extracurricu-
.ar activities are dedicated to the activities of which they are
Lmembers. They take their jobs seriously, whether those jobs be in
Student Government, a campus newspaper, or a fraternity. Delta
Sigma Chi has shown their dedication to the community service as-
pect of fraternity life. This is a function which all fraternities take
seriously, just as a campus newspaper takes seriously its responsibility
to report the news and a Student Government takes seriously its res-
ponsibility to protect the interests of the students especially when it
jginvolves the question of students’ rights and privileges. For adminis-
"-trators who work with these kinds of students almost daily to make
such statements is appalling.

A By their "reasoning administrators can make decisions affecting
.St|_.l(le.Ilt_S with no input from any students. ‘It has been this type of at-
e which prevailed duringithe turbulent period of the ’60’s which‘

at Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor:

Joseph Forbes tilts at the UAR
staff once again! In a letter to me
in July 1971 Joe made the same

accusations of t financial hanky-
panky on the part of Rudy
Potenzone and others that he

repeats in the May 14 Pitt News.
I responded to those accusations
in a private letter to Joe at that
time; Irespond in this public letter
now. .
1. At no time did any UAR,staff
either receive or pay themselves 3
salary. Modest hourly wages of

$1.50 or so were paid to volunteers .

who -actually conducted the class

surveys. Card punchers were paid ,

at the rate of 75 cents for each 100
cards; this averaged out to $2 to $3
an hour depending upon their Skill-
’ One or two staff members did
punch cards.
2./Toward the end of the summer

Foreigners

‘On April 17th the Immigration
and Naturalization Service’ handed
down a directive to the foreign
student offices around the country

advising them that they are no

longer authorized to issue work
permits to foreign students, not
even for summer work»

In the past the foreign students
have usually been ablelto obtain
wok permits for summer jobs fairly
easily, and some also for part-time
jobs while attending school. The
reason given by the Immigration
Service for the new policy is the
alleged pressure. that the foreign

_ student employment exerts against

the job. market contributing, as is
claimed, to higher unemployment

‘ rates among Americans.

But are‘ these allegations justif-
able on the basis of facts? In order
to answer this question, we have to
briefly consider the economic and
political aspects of the problem.

To begin with there are about
150,000 foreign students in the
U.S., out of whom about one-third

or 50,000 have in the past been able "

to secure some kind of summer
employment. (New York Times,
June 11, 1974). The effect of this
50,000 jobs on the general

unemployment situation would be
less than 0.025%. This can hardly

be construed as significant pres-
sure on the job market to warrant
such harsh measures.

The fallacy of the argument
becomes even more self-evident if
one considers a second factor. The
kinds of jobs that the majority of
foreign students are relegated to
doing are among the absolutely
lowest paid jobs with wages

college campuses.

‘ questions

of 1970, when the new book format
and computer analysis were being
developed, Rudy and his co-chair-
man, Lynn Goldberg, did indeed
commute several times from their
homes in order to complete the
1970 Winter evaluation in time for
1971 Winter pre-registration in
October. The total spent on plane
fares was -$300.00. —

3. The so-called waste of $2,000
in 1970 because of foul-ups was not
the fault of the UAR staff; it was a
failure by others to carry out
mailing instructions. Mistakes
represent a waste only. if we don't
learn; the UAR learned a lot.

4. Does it take .“conspicuous
gall” to have a student publication
which seeks to discuss seriously
like the quality of
education, the role of grades, the
fairness of testing, etc.? That was
Rudy and Kath'y’s goal, it was my

goal and the UAR did become a
publication. Rudy _and Kathy
(Stackhouse, co-editor with Poten-
zone in 1970) and others put in
hundreds of hours on UAR with no
compensation; Joe Forbes wrote
accusatory letters as his contribu-
‘tion.

5. Basically Joe doesn’t like to
seeteaching and.courses rated by
numbers; he finds it too fragile a
thing to capture in a crude
numerical net. Well, fragile it
certainly is, but numbers seem a

great improvement over n_o infor- .

mation at all which is our present
lot. I believe that even Joe would

choose the instructor rated 8 (on a.

scale of 10) over the one rated 2.

Joe Forbes, wherever you are,
why not look for another more
deserving cause?‘
John R. Townsend
UAR Faculty Advisor

Denied Work Permits

oftentimes well below the mini-
mum wage required by law._

7 This is the case particularly with
those foreign students who are
unable to obtain legal work permits
and are therefore at the mercy of
the employer to determine the
wage.
dishwashing, busing in restaur-
aunts, and working behind snack
shop counters are among ‘the most
common types of employment
among foreign students.

The same New York Times
article clearly points out. the
dilemma and danger faced, by
foreign students: “The foreign
student association and many
student advisers say that the

immigration service has under-.

estimated the number of students
who must work and they predict
that those students who do not
receive work permits will probably
work anyway. The advisers fear
that students caught working
illegally mayjeopardize their
careers in this country.”

In addition to the moratorium on
jobs for foreign students, a recent
ruling requires that foreign
students_who apply for visas be
able to provide proof of assured
ﬁnancial support, for the entire
duration of their projected stay in
this country. This regulation
clearly prevents capable but less
financially endowed students from
obtaining an education in this
country. , _ g «

These recent rulings have served
to compound the already existing
repressive laws and regulations.
Some of these are:

(1) There is no statute of

\

It is about time the staff of the Office of Student Affairs began

concerning themselves with these-

issues. The decision placing Delata

Sigma Chi on probation for an orientation violation should be re-
voked. Considering the fact that other fraternities also had beer and

that beer was present in the Towers dorms, a penalty such as proba- '

tion which denies the reason for the existence of a fraternity is harsh

and unnecessary punishment. No

one will benefit from that punish-

ment except the punishing instincts of the "Student Affairs staff.

We wholeheartedly support the measures being taken by Stud-
ent Government President"Mike Furick to resolve the situation. We
also believe a review of the judicial processes on campus is neces-
sary to make sure such a situation never arises again.

Most importantly, though, the staff of the Office of Student

denied to foreign students.

In collusion with the US ‘Govern-
ment many are deported to in

countries ruled by puppet corrupt"

and dictatorial governments and
their lives are often put in danger.
(3) Foreign students must have

their visas renewed-yearly which
leads to discriminatory refusals
based on the_ students’ political
activities as well as other arbitrary
grounds. ‘

While these laws discriminate,

against all foreign students, they
particularly pose a threat to
politically active foreign students.
They have been selectively used by

.the U.S. Government to harass
and/or deport politically active i

foreign students. .

.These students are evenmore
threatened by a recent unpubli-
cized ruling making it an indictable
offense f‘to insult a foreign
diplomat." This law wasinvoked
indict nine and convict two
foreign students in California who
had been involved in a -verbal
exchange with a diplomat from
their own country.

In as much as the work “insult”
is subject to wide interpretation, it

is clear that this ruling is designed.

to curtail the foreign students’

political activities and suppress»

-their expression of political dissent.
This law stands in blatant

contradiction with freedom _of
expression, the inalienable civil‘
right guaranteed to foreigners as

well as citizens.

In light of these economically
and politically repressive laws
which jeopardize the livelihood and
educaton of foreign students and
deny their basic- civil rights, we
invite all foreign students and
others sympathetic to attend an
open forum to discuss these issues
and to take steps to ensure the
equitable treatment of foreign
students. The forum will he held

Field House.” Both facilities will
be ~ open ‘ an extra hour Monday
through Thursday, five extra "hours
on Saturday, and" two extra on

Sunday. “This will provide more
facilities to more people,” noted
Furick.

“The squash courts in the Field

1

football games in the fall, too,’
Furick said. “So if you. don’t want
to to to the football game, you can
play squash.”

- Furick also said a checkout
station for recreational equipment

vwill be located in Schenley Hall.

“You’ll be able to get paddleball

racquets, footballs, frisbees, you,

name it," he said.

According to committee member
Charles R. Coble, “a practically
forgotten locker room in the
basement of Schenley Hall will be
set up for men and women
commuters who might want to
shower and change after using the
facilities.” .,

The enclosed area across__Fifth
Avenue from the Towers adjacent
to the Frick Elementary School will
be turned into. tennis courts by
September, said Coble who noted
that although the area is under the
jurisdiction of the Pittsburgh

' School District, “things will pro-

bably be worked out."

_Coble, who is also an executive
assistant to the Chancellor said he
realizes the Committee's action

does not leave Pitt with a first-rate ‘

intramural and recreational pro-
gram. I

“We got together a pretty good
package,” he said, “but we have
no illusion that it’s adequate.
What we are doing really is two
things. These six recommenda-
tions represent those things, that
could get an immediate impact.
Now we have to develop a long
range plan that will represent a
ﬁrst rate program. ‘ '

Coble said he didn’t know the
total cost for all the improvements,
but said he has several “separate
totals based on estimates.”

Furick said the money would
come from Fiesta Bowl receipts and
“hardecash from the Chancellor’s
office.” i '

Administration Orders Frat Probation

(Continued from Page I)

Mullens sent a written complaint
to Natali charging that Delta Sigma
Chi had violated orientation reg-
ulations. “No effort was made to
check age. Anyone possessing an
orientation ID was admitted,”
according to the complaint. It also
charged that “alcoholic beverages
were made available to all in
attendance.” ,

Natali called a meeting of the
IFC Judicial Board for June 27 to
deal with the complaint. Meloro
had conferred with Alden Bowen,
Coordinator of the Campus Judicial
System, earlier in the day and
decided the complaint was not
within the jurisdiction of the IFC
Judicial Board or the Campus
Judicial Board. A '

“We have no judicial system to
deal with this type of action,”
commented Meloro. “It would not
be within the powers of the IFC
Judicial Board to deal with it. It
was not within the jurisdiction of
the Campus Judicial Board because
it was an organization that was
involved and not an individual.”

Meloro decided it was within the
jurisdiction of the Student Affairs
Office because it was a directive of
the Vice-Chancellor that had been

_, violated. Moye and Bowen agreed.

George Kostelnik, President of
Delta Sigma Chi, does not agree
with the process used by Student
Affairs. _ “Basically we were
unjustly tried,” he said. “The
penalty was extremely stiff. It was
not a formal hearing and the
process was really bad. We had
no idea of who the witnesses were.
That's why it was an unfair trial.”

Witnesses who complained to
Mullens were not required to

testify at the June 27 meeting .

“because they want to‘rush in the
fall." according to Natali. Mullens
commented. “People who reported
the incident were not personally
abused so there is no reason why
their names should be public."
“Delta Sigma Chi did not deny
they served alcohol,” said Meloro.
“Who cares who told me at that
point. On that basis I dealt with it
and not because the fraternity was

accused. . I considered what I got‘

only from their mouths as to what
happened. That is how I took

' action.”

Referring to‘ the lack of a formal

hearing Meloro commented, “Del-'

ta Sigma Chi had admitted they
had alcohol. It was not necessary
to,have a formal hearing because
they admitted they had alcohol."~

Student Government (SG) Pres-
ident Mike Furick also disagrees
with the decision made by Meloro.
“There has been no due process,”
said Furick. “I don't care what the
punishment is or what happened. I
am concerned about who does the
sentencing. It should be the
students. If Moye can do this with
a fraternity why can’t he make a
decision like this involving the Pitt
News or the Ski Club. It could
happen to anyone."

Commenting on Meloro’_s de-

cision the incident was outside the -

jurisdiction of the established
judicial boards, Furick said, “If a
student drinks beer in the Towers
and is caught he is hauled before

fraternitiesion campus has never
really been defined.

“The administration, has never
pressed charges against a student
group and if we need another
judicial system because the present
ones supposedly are not adequate
to deal with the situation then we
could set up another judicial board.

The system. we have now is
adequate though. We've never
handled this situation before and
that is why it seems so unusual and
supposedly outside the scope of
these judicial boards."

SG was no_t involved in Meloro's

decision. “Student Governinent
was not involved in Meloro's
decision. “Student Government

was not involved because Delta
Sigma Chi is not a student
organization and because frater-
nities exist at the pleasure of the
University," said Meloro.

Furick disagreed. “IFC is a
recognized student‘ organization
and fratemities-are a branch of that

‘organization. A decision made by

the Student Affairs Office necessi-
tates SG intervention when it is an
improper decision.” ,
Kostelnik considers the punish-
ment “a shocker." He com-
mented, “The penalty would
definitely ruin the fraternity. In my
opinion the University gave us a

decision that was penalizing

3’ When Johnny Majors had his squad floundering through annual
spring drills back in April. a story was related to me by an extremely
A reliable source concerning Majors‘ and Pitt's arch-rival. Joe Paterno
?and the Penn State Nittany Lions. 4
At that time, both coaches were counting the blue chip prospects each
“had recruited for the upcoming season and licking their respective
‘wounds. Pitt’s Blue-Gold game was entertaining, but with so many
key personnel absent due to injuries or not yet enrolled at the
University, the whole affair was not very exciting. Penn State’s
(‘Blue-White game turned out to be nothing but absolutely dull.
, _ But it was around the end of March that Paterno. in response to
A questions regarding his practice of recruiting local high school talent
fl versus Ma_jor‘s willingness to search the depths of America with no
“}‘)ill'ilCUl«'.ll' regard for area boys. leveled some criticism at Johnny.
Paterno. The God of State College. PA. accused Majors of totally
‘ neglecting Pennsylvania's finestvgraduating high schoolers and thus
 giving himself and perhaps even the rest ofthe college recruiters in the
7 state a bad name. According to Paterno. one of the primary interests a
7 head coach should have is uncovering. discovering and developing the
‘V local talent.
T Majors had openly admitted prior to the Blue-Gold game that Pitt had
‘signed only seven freshman recruits from Pennsylvania for next fall.
‘He stated at that time the seven were primarily the only local prospects
. . that Pitt was interested in, although a few naturally elected to continue
 their academic careers outside the state.
if " Major‘s list of upcoming frosh and junior college transfers was made
"  public as soon as the NCAA allowed and kept updated with each
addition. .

Meanwhile. Paterno did not release his list to the sports media. as is
his usual custom. .

_ _ But in Harrisburg, a little man threw a wrench into the nicely oiled,
‘fwell maintained machine ‘that Paterno and State's Sports Information
 Director Johnny Morris like to call press relations.

This little man. a sports writer for some (to me) obscure Harrisburg
'» daily. wouldn't accept Paterno‘s refusal to release the list of recruits.
T He contacted the NCAA and had them relinquish those names so
precious to Joe. He even went so far as to print them ‘in his paper.

As it turned out. Paterno‘s recruits hailing from his own state
numbered eight--one more than lvlajors.
~ And for the little man, Paterno allegedly told him not to return to
State College for any Penn State football function for he would not be
well received. ,

And speaking of something which upsets my stomach. I received a
release this week from-—who else--Penn State's Sports information
Department. lt cited information from an NCAA release (which l had
previously received) stating why Penn State has been ranked as one of
the best teams in the coun-try for the last five and--good God--even ten
years.

"The Lion head man (l’aterno) is preparing for his 25th year season at
Penn State. He has a nine year record of 75 wins. 13 losses and a tie as
head coach...." -

it went on to say that State would open the season with a nationally
televised game against “Pacific F.igli_t power Stanford" and then listed
the other"'powers“ that Paterno will match his winningest-coach-in-
the country (percentagewisc) record against: Navy. lowa. Army. Wake
Forest. Syracuse. Maryland and Ohio (at this point the release fails to
mentionithat it is Ohio UNIVERSITY). Of course the meat of Paterno‘s
"tough schedule" is West Virginia. North Carolina State and Pitt.

: Almost Heaven

. Cheat River Rafting

BY LINDA GALL

At 6 am on a Saturday morning,
Pittsburgh is a quiet place. A few,
but not many people are out in the
streets. Some are going to work,
some are awake not to waste a
beautiful day. and at least five are
sitting in one Howard Johnson's
parking lot, staring at a road map,
ready to head for the Cheat River,
Albright. West Virginia, to experi-
ence white water rafting.

Back in January, little did we
know what kind of weather we
would have on April 27, but we
were lucky. We picked one of the
nicest days of spring for our aquatic
journey. There in the parking lot
sunshine of one of the earliest fine
spring days we met our first omen,
a hearse with West Virginia tags.

It did not go unnoticed, but was-

treated with’ jabs [hey, lookee
there] and jokes.

The ride down route ‘79 was
interesting, like most interstate
travelling. It was our bridge
between concrete Pittsburgh and
wild country West Virginia, illus-
trated by Route 19 South, winding

up and down hills complete with‘

crazy country morning drivers
passing’ us on blind curves.
Peculiar places, grazing sheep and
cattle in ﬁelds beside the road,
whizzed by as we floated along.
We saw our second omen just
before arriving in Albright. Nailed
to the side of a barn, among other
signs advertising Mailpouch To-
bacco, was a sign that read
“Prepare to meet thy Lord."
' The raft trip began at the Albright
ﬁre hall. There we “freshened up
a bit" before the trip.
watching the early group get a few
quick lessons in rafting, we picked
out life preservers, paddles and a
dry bag, similar to those found in
any kitchen, to hold our cigarettes
and other items. It should be noted
that no amount of dry bags will
keepthings dry ifjthe bundle is to
be stored at the bottom of a Cheat
River raft. Your best bet‘ is to put
your soakables inside your shirt, or
‘in a tennis shoe tied to 'your_head.
At 11 am we started our 12 mile
raft trip. Our party consisted of

quarter of a mile later had a chance

to put it to practice. But not before L _.

waters to retrieve it. The water

was only/knee deep, saving our-I

friend from frost bite, but their
strong current carried the paddle}:
down stream before it could be_

retrieved. So we went into our ﬁrst
set of rapids minus one paddler.

Our lead guide introduced

himself as “Lucky”, an almost _

After the shock of our first rapids

:Without Gas, Beer,

(Continuezl from Page 7)

" stopped near a pool hall. Surely
‘pool halls sell beer and cigarettes;
those good ol' southern boys whose
L waists had reached balloon propor-
tions and whose seats had been
 calloused from years of bar stool
thickness wouldn't patronize a dry
smokeless pool hall. '

 

I ‘ As two of us approached this
 , bastion of southern society. we

' ‘ noticed the room was‘ a bit too
7 ‘crowded. even for Saturday night.

I The clientele seemed a bit ‘too
-family-like and we heard a voice
bellowing into the street.

“Do I hear ten? Ten dollars, ten
‘dollars, sold!” A man was holding
an old wooden lamp up before rows
«. of the seated townspeople. An
1. auction. No beer. Worse yet, no
i " cigarettes.

Gas; While lack of the right
‘smoking brand had one of our
”ni,cotine addicts coughing on

  
  
  
  
  
   
  
    
    
 
  
   
  
  
  
    
 
  

it rcstof us irritated. the thought of
 running out of gas was too much.
 ..At this point it would seem
 a-ppropriate to tell a tale of being
 stranded. but we did get gas,
 thanks to the bespeckled owner of a
 general store, clad in green
working fatigues and a stiff green

  
 

 

 

   

ementhols. and lack of beer had the -

  “or Cigarettes in Al1)1‘ig‘ht

cap. While the. store man opened
his closed-down pumps for us, we
looked around the two room store
complete with televisions, work
clothing, food and ice cream. But
no beer and a narrow selection of
cigarettes. '

We arrived in Morgantown at
10:30 pm. We bacame familiar
with the main streets of the town
while hunting a motel...near a bar.
One of us ripped a page from the
local yellow pages and made a
reservation for “his sister and two
friends. “The three women,
carrying the backpacks and sleep-
ing bags for the group. went out in
search of the motel. Due to a
confusion in names. they stumbled
into a pretentious whiskey-reeking
hotel. An evil eye from the man at
the desk and they were on the"
street again. ,

The final count for the evening
was: on two-bed room [doubles]
in a cardboard-walled motel‘ where
one member of our group com-
mented we’d hear groanin’ and
grindin’ all night long and IV:
glasses of beer, not to forget one
package of Tareytons.

The morning found us a large
southern-sty-le breakfast and a
highway to Pittsburgh. At least we
had a place to stay there.

 ’ Penguins, SabresDeal  

The Pittsburgh Penguins have
announced they have reached
agreement with the Buffalo Sabres
that will allow the Sabres to place a
minimum of seven players with the
Penguins‘ American Hockey, Lea-
gue affiliate. the Hershey Bears,
next season.

General Manager Jack Button
announced the plan in Pittsburgh
following suspension of operations
in Cincinnati by the Buffalo
organization.

Hershey”, the 1974 Calder Cup
champion lost several players in

recent drafts and it was the
‘decision of Button and Hershey
President Frank Mathers to allow
another NHL team to place their
top players in Hershey to maintain

the continuity of Hershey’s win--"1'

ning ways.

Pittsburgh will continue in its role
as the chief supplier of talent for
the Bears under a long—term
agreement. but will be augmented
for at least this year by seven
players from the Buffalo organiza-
tion.

 

»     Cheatftiver Rafting  

/ (Continued from Page 7)

and while we were waiting for
further instructions a number of
‘stories made the rounds, concern-
ing the middle-aged man lying face
down on a boulder, a guide pushing
on his chest to get his heart
working. We thought the man
must have fallen out of a raft on the
last set of rapids and drowned. Or
maybe his head hit a rock and
knocked him unconscious to be
swept downstream. We became
very apprehensive’ about the
remainder of the trip. Omen of

' omens.

It wasn't until we hadireturned to
the fire hall that a guide told us the
man had a heart attack and died.

This information did us no good
after the trip. We wished there
hadn't been such an air of secrecy
and suspense surrounding the man
on the river.

We found out the man had had
open-heart surgery and several
strokes in recent years and wasn’t
expected to live very much longer.
His wife, in the raft with him, said
she was glad her husband died
doing something he enjoyed.

As the Cheat River is in a canyon
there -is no way for any vehicle,
even a helicopter, to come to an
unfortunate rafter’s aid--except
another raft. And because the
canyon walls are so tall there is no
way for walkie-talkie signals .to
escape the sound of the water

rushing over the rocks. Thus, the
man was rafted downstream.
Both groups were bunched
together on the river for the
remainder of the trip. After hitting

‘a few hydraulic holes, dumping

water ino the rafts, and sending our
heads ﬂying roller-coaster style, we
reached the end of our trip and
loaded our equipment’ into waiting
trucks. No one saw the old man or
his widow, and there were no more
omens. We gorged ourselves on a
hot -meal at the fire hall and
planned our next adventure--sky-
diving. A A
