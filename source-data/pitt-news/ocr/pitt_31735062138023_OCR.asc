rive here tomorrow morning. Early
Friday they will leave for Meadville
where they engage Allegheny college.

Michael Foot and John Stafford
Cripps, the Oxford representatives,
are scheduled to propose America's
abandonment of herisolationist pol-
icy, against Israel Goldberg, C36, and;
VVinston Mcconkey, C35.

Brought to the United States by the

Youth lnventory
Conducted Here

Students Assist Commission In
Educational Project

An “Inventory of oncoming youth"
is being conducted by 39 University
students under the supervision of Dr.
Charles E, Prall, dean of the School
of Education, and Theodore A, Siedle,
assistant to the dean_

The “inventory,” one phase of a
project conducted by the commission
for the study of educational problems
in Pennsylvania, features a. detailed
investigation of experiences, back-
ground, capacities, interests, and pres-,
ent status of representative groups of
Pennsylvania youth. The results will
be used to furnish basic material for
the determination of progressive edu-
cafional policies,

The subjects of the research are
students who entered the sixth grade.-
iu Allegheny and West1nore1a.nd
county schools during the years 1926
and 1928.

lnvestigat.ors must contact the
school in which the student was en-
rolled at the time and then follow his
career through to the present. Sources
of data are school records. ratings of ac-
ouaintances, a.nd personal interviews.
The information collected is social,
economic, and individual in nature. ‘

At a combined seminar of electrical
and industrial engineers, it was H. E.
Dyche, head of the department, who
pulled the meeting out of a bad hole.
G_ W’, First, of Clark Controller com-
pany, discussed motor controllers, but
when he attempted to demonstrate,
the current just didn’t flow.

Following Mr. Dycl1e’s suggestion.
the seminar retired to the electrical’
laboratory, where the Varitime con-
troller, furnished with the necessary
220 volts, functioned perfectly.

Send-off Tonight‘

Students, Band To See Varsity
Entrain For Nebraska

, ground,

Nothing to do tonight?

Lots of ;
time to waste but“ no money and,
nowhere to go? i

The Executive committee of thel
Student Faculty association has;

crashed through with a new idea for
the University—a. place to go tonight;
and something to do for all students,
even if they’re down to their last two
car checks.

Most people know that Saturday
afternoon the varsity football team
will be strewing bodies—or being

Lincoln, Nebraska. Out there, visitors
suffer from drought, cyclones and six-
foot-four guards and tackles of 200
pounds and more.

So tonight at about curfew time the
University band and innumerable stu-
dents will be on hand at the Pennsyl-
vania station, exhorting the players
with the old “Sockitoem” and “Hail
to Pitt” with words and music.

Lieutenant-Colonel E. J. Cullen,
head of the department of military
science and member of SFA, original-
ly submitted the idea.

The new Mellon Institute building
at Fifth a.nd Belleﬁeld avenues will

distinction when the front doors are
ﬁnished: 36 feet in height. they will
be the largestin the world with cast.

The newly arrived doors will close
the three apertures of the main
entrance on Fifth avenue.
door will be composed of three sec-
tions and will be covered by a cast-
aluminum grille. A tentative grille
design in plaster of paris has been
erected on one of the huge windows

Scout Says, ‘Hail, Farewell!’

By The Campus Scout

HEN THE PANTHER football squad entrains for Ne-

hraska at Pennsylvania station tonight, the University
band will lead a. send-off by old grads, young grads, under-
grads and plain football enthusiasts of all attachments.

About once a year such unimpressionable experts as
Havey Boyle, James J. Long and Chester Smith, wearing a
green liat, trek up Liberty avenue to see the Panthers oﬁi.
And tonight. looks like the night.

It has gotten about that Dr. Jock Sutherland likes his
team, and 64,000 persons who saw them throw memories of
the Boyne into old Notre Dame last Saturday can under-

stand the einotion.

Playing more or less in their own backyard, the Pan-
thers have won as ﬁne a 1nid—sea.son record as any team in
the East. They have beaten \V.&J., Southern California and
Notre Dame in the stadium, and on short jaunts have ac-

counted for “Vest Virginia and Vllestminster.

There is even

a “Minnesota in November” club, calling for a return en-
gagement between Pitt and the §»G'opl1ers sometime after the
frost has settled on the pigskin, which refuses to toot any

Big Ten horns.

INSETTING OUT FOR Nebraska tonight, nevertlieless,
Pitt undertakes a campaign something like old General
Hannibal’s when he left Ca1'tl1a.,eje to extend his reputation

over toward Rome.

If Hannibal had to cross more of a

grade, the Panthers have to cover a greater geographical
distance, with a certain knowledge (whereas Hannibal only
had his expectations) ’r_.hat_Nebra_ska’s Cornhuskers, “the
Wrecl_{1ng'-crew of the Big S1x,” will be set. to ruin another
proimsmg Pitt football season If they can.
T . ,

l\pbod)* east of Fort ‘Wm-'11e, Indiana, probably, believes
that l\ebraska is going to stop the Panthers this year. Pitt.
IS a strong candidate. for the Rose Bowl again and will not

venture a poor showing in the Middle V-Vest.

But other

promising Pitt teams have been sent home from Lincoln to
blush unseen in \Vestern Pennsylvania as far as the Rose
Bowl coniuiittee was concerned.

This particular ma.l.ad,v, known as “Rose Fever,” shows
no signs of aﬁecting the Panther squad as they pl-epare to
entrain tonight. Most probably they will be concentrating.
on playing good football next Saturday on a drought—burned
ﬁeld where Pitt teams have won a single game in four

visits.

Those who go to the Pennsylvania, station at 9 o’clock
will be justified in raising send-off cheers.

Grandson Of Former
University Head
Enrolled Here

James McCormick, grandson of a
former Chancellor of the University,
the late Samuel Black McCormick, is
a freshman at the University this
year. McCormick, who originally
came from Wisconsin, is a graduate
of Oakmont High school. His grand-

- father was head of the Western Uni-

versity of Pennsylvania, and then of

the University of Pittsburgh, from
1904 to 1920.
It was during Dr. McCor1nick’s

regime that the ﬁrst movements to-
ward the expansion of the University
were begun, After WUP had been
retitled the University of Pittsburgh
in 1908, land was acquired for the
erection of the buildings which make
up the campus today. In 1909 Dr. Mc-
Cormick began the building of State
and Thaw halls, and the establish-
ment of graduate schools. During
the period from 1904 to 1920, the total
enrollment increased from 800 to 6000,

After his retirement in 1920, Dr. Mc-
Cormick was Chancellor Emeritus un-
til his death in 1928. '

Hovde Addresses
Discussion Group

 

Competition, Minorities Named
As Factors In Nationalism

The creation of small minorities by
the ‘World war, and the operation of
an economic system in which compe-
tition is the prime factor were named
by Dr. B. J, Hovde as important fea-
tures in post-war nationalism in dis-
-cussing the subject before the Inter-
lnational Relations group Monday.

“These new states,” Dr. Hovde said,
“have just recently completed their
struggle for nationalism, and each one
regards its nationalism as the exist-
ing thing in its life.”

In regard to the economic system,
Dr. Hovde said, “The European coun-
tries have cut down their agricultural
imports and intensiﬁed their own
agriculture in order tocreate a trade
balance. This is the reason why
American and Canadian agriculture
felt the depression long before indus-
try did.

“One of the most important devel-
opments is the interesting and novel
experiment that is being conducted in
Russia," Dr. Hovde declared.

“Prior to the war the power of the
Czardom was the only thing that kep-t
Russia from falling apart. Since the
fall of the Czar, the Russian Soviet
government has been able to main-
tain its position so effectively that
the country has been kept intact.”

He added, “Russia is the only group
with different interests, remaining
under one head. She has been able
to do so because she has given each
section complete autonomy in cul-
tural matters.”

Pennsylvania Leads Nation
In Zoological Conservation

“Pennsylvania leads the entire na-
tion in conservation at -the present
time, and it has the greatest outdoor
laboratories for the study of natural
history to be found anywhere in the
United States,” stated Dr. Samuel H.
Williams, professor of zoology, re-
cently returned from a meeting
of the Pennsylvania Board of Game
Commissioners in Harrisburg.

The game commission, an adminis-
trative body which directs all of the
conservation activities pertaining to
wild life, established a gigantic re-
search of the new Pymatuning dam
project for migratory water fowls.
Within a few years time, it is expect-
ed that this area will surpass the well-
known Canadian sanctuaries.

Two American Artists
Fascinate C r o W (1

At Exhibition

 

By Herrymon Maurer

I SPENT AN HOUR last Sunday afternoon in the Car-

negie Institute galleries. The rooms given over to
the International were crowded. Long lines of persons
strung along in front of each wall. I watched them.
Many of them were arrested by Thomas Benton’s “Lord
Save the Child” and Grant Wood’s “Dinner for Thresh-
ers.”

It was easy to understand why crowds halted before
these two pictures. Both artists have made use of an
easily understood American manner of communication
and have dealt with their material with warm sympathy.
Few, perhaps, in the crowd last Sunday analyzed the
structure and technique of the paintings. Many of them
probably took for granted the competency of the presen-
tation and were interested only in what the artists said.

Bol:h these men do say something. Thomas Benton
has painted an uncultured religious gathering. The
communal activity of the sisters and brotllers he has
portrayed sympathetically. He has used warm, arrest-
ing colors and a dramatic nervous composition. Finally
he has transmitted effectively his understanding of why
superstitious hopes overcome the common sense of per-
sons spiritually starved.

. The Spirit of Collective Action

Grant Wood, using the old Ita.lian—primitive architec-
tural background, has caught the American spirit of col-
lective action in his picture of the threshers’ dinner hour.
That the painting demands a wa.ll——Mr. Wood no doubt
would like to ﬁnd one for it—and is successful as a
sketch for a. mural, not as an easel painting, was of lit-
tle signiﬁcance to the people Sunday, who were caught
up by the human qualities the artist has crea.ted in this
picture of the threshers and the women serving them.

I a1n not suggesting that a person’s appreciation and
judgment of a painting should be determined by the
number of persons standing before it. Not at all. Still
the Sunday crowd stirred thought. Almost all persons
have strong defense mechanisms. However nourishing.
and effective a painting may be, a person’s preconceived
ideas of society and the manner of painting will enter
into his appreciation. The visitors at the galleries Sun-
day appreciated Benton and .Wood largely because they
did not ﬁ11d their methods of paintings and their ideas

too startling.

Prejudices Hinder Responses To Art
But, whether appreciated or not, any painting, it seems

“to me, which has a sound excuse for existence has the

capacity to appeal or to be understood by almost every-
one. True, it takes some time to lower our prejudice-

gates; but those gates once lowered, certain paintings,
.some more effective, than those of Mr. Benton and Mr.

Wood, will be widely appreciated.

In this group are Karl Sterrer’s “Life” and Marcel
'Gromair’e’s “Worker-s of the Soil," both of which I have
mentioned in an earlier article. The former transmits
emotions which would gain a response from many per-
sons, if those persons would a.ckn_0W1€dge 1'-hell‘ OWII 1111'
happiness and hopelessness instead of trying to sup-
press these feelings. The latter speaks in a dynamic but
not well-known idiom. He, too, is not appreciated by
many; for as time is necessary for new ideas to inﬁltrate
into groups of persons, so time is necessary for the ac-
ceptance of new methods of expression.

The ha.ppy day will come, as happy days have come
in the past, when defense mechanisms are less strong
than they are today. Then, however far distant that
day may be, art can fulﬁll a more vital function.

This vital function Charles Burchﬁeld with his “Old
Houses in Winter” and Pierre Paulus with his “Return
from Work” have in a measure succeeded in fulﬁlling.
There is in both pictures an .'.=.tmosphere of desolation
and gloom, effectively conceived and transmitted. \Vhat
is .more, there is in Paulus’ painting a dreary, ‘plodding
quality.

Dali’s Work Not Vital

I should hesitate to say that I like the painting by Sal-
vador Dali, “Enigmatic Elements in Landscape” because
it is vital. I-Vitli it and in some ways with the zirst-prize
winner I am pleased because the artist has succeeded in
what he tried to do, and because the results are not
whol‘y foreign to human emotions. But Dali, more than
Blume perhaps, deals. with subconscious emotions, artis-
tically new but not particularly important. But he does
stir in the observer a swirling, oppressive feeling of
space stretching away and pushing down at the same
time.

The third prize winner, Karl Hofer, has not attempted
a great deal, though he has been successful in what he
has tried. In “Pastoral,” a painting excellent in color
and composition, he has created placidity. Pierre Bonard
has given to “Dining Room” a sad atmosphere.

There are many artists less successful than Dali and

The Pitt

Hofer in transmitting emotion. However excellent are
the technical tricks of Picasso, he never has attempted,
nor will he attempt, to deal with a really important emo-
tion, As is usual with his paintings, “Still Life with :1
Guitar" tickles the palates of esthetes. Matisse, who is
not an experimenter, is just as reluctant to deal with
anything but line and color. Possessed of sensuous
beauty, his typical painting “Nude in an Interior at Nice”
may be; still it has no qualities which make for at deep
appeah

Unsuccessful, too, is Maurice Sterne.
human beings tecl1nical‘:y. “Mexican Fiesta” contains a
contrast between wretchedly-dressed peasants and a rich-
ly-decorated church—a contrast which is technically dra-
matic, not human.

Last year DuBois was represented by a picture in
which he hit at the essence of :1 night club. There were
on that canvas rich men with blue unreal skin tones.
with stiff white shirts, with shining patcs. Less suc-
cessful this year is “Sunburned Nude.” Technically it
 good, but it lacks what another painting :11 the Amer-
ican section has—“Portrait of a Man” by ‘W. Schub-

a sincere portrayal of an inmate of Hearbreaki House.
Three Satirical Paintings

I have saved to the last mention of three satirical
paintings. David Silvette’s “Gertrude ‘.lcGovcrn”
Go:;a—like portrait of a patriotic woman _whose character
is understood and expressed. The woman is coarse.
smug, egotistic. C. R. W. Nevinson takes a hot shot at
the movies in his effective painting, “A Comment on Vul-
garity or World Deﬁnition of Beauty and Grace.” And,
in “Folly Beach,” George Biddle has painted bored, self-
interested, well-to-do persons with distorted faces and
bodies in quarrelling but self-satisﬁed attitudes. . These
three paintings have teeth.

VVhat of the omissions from this year’s exhibition. I
miss Eugene Higgins, who last year had a painting of
earthy ﬁgures of proletarians awakening from a night’s
sleep in the open.
painters are represented. I remember reading some-
where a. Carnegie official said that they followed too
closely the style of French pa.inting. But there are at
least ﬁfteen or so Mexican painters who have practically
no connection with any outside school of art. Examples
of modern Mexican painting w-ould be interesting and
instructive to all of us. -

Old England With New ideas
IT IS DOUBTFUL whether a majority of people
who attend the Oxford-Pitt debate ‘tomorrow
night at Schenley high school will be greatly con-
cerned over the topic for discussion. Democratic
Americans still retain secret reverence for foreign

_ titles and iv_v-covered illstitutions; so that. the two

representatives from Great Britain, with M.P.’s
for fathers and bearing good English names, will
be objects of curiosity and comment.

That observation is, of course, no reflection on
the abilit_v of the foreigners. Oxford men have

, opposed Pitt three times in the past and won the

plaudits of intelligent members of the audience.
The point is that the audience Thursday will prob-
ably care less for what is said than how it is said
and who says it. . , , , 

The question. reads, “Resolved: That. the aban-
domnent. of an isolation policy is essential to the
return of American prosperity.” Now, here is a
subject. that has been disturbing the Roosevelt ad-
ministration ever since it took command of the
still chaotic mess of our national economic life.
Secretary of State Hull is Wailing for a let.-down of
our tariff barriers; Secretary of Agriciilture Vila]-
lace has written a pamphlet, “America Must
Choose,” arguing for a middle course in our in-
ternational trade policy; while the President him-
self scems to be following the plan of recovery by
internal projects and continuance of relative isola-
tion. 'Where the present. adininistratioii course
will. lead it is futile to predict, but apparently our
tariff walls are not going to crumble for some time
yet.

The Oxford team, echoing traditional British
sentiment, will urge America to adopt some kind
of a free trade policy. In fact, as the question
reads, the Englishmen will maintain that we must
increase our world trade in order to regain pros-
perity. Their reasons should prove interesting.

What About Publicity?

T A MEETING OF women activity leaders last Wed-

nesday the relative Inerits of organization publicity
were discussed. This effort to make women’s activities
“publicity conscious” resulted in no deﬁnite concensus
on all issues. but some of the opinions made were import-
ant from the standpoint that this was the first time that
the question of publicity was thrown open to the cam-
pus for a discussion of its merits and demerits.

The entire assemblage agreed that a college paper
should be to a campus what a city paper should be to
a city in that it should serve the best interests of the
respective locality; that a college paper is capable of
molding opinion both for and against an organization;
that one of the main uses of a campus newspaper is that
of regimenting a following for an organization. Every
woman in attendance agreed that the executive body of
an organization which legislates for a larger number of
students than are represented in the executive body,
should not determine policies and plans without giving
every member of the organization an opportunity to
know of those plans even if she cannot determine them,
and agreed that the campus newspaper was the best

media through which those ‘plans and policies should be '

transferred.

Although agreement was reached on the fact that re-
forms in organizations can be accomplished quicker if all
-the facts are known, the assemblage split over the wis-
dom of making those facts known to the entire student
body through the newspaper if only a small percentage
are affected. Some believing that the correction should be
madeise‘cr'e‘tly, and others that the public should deter-
mine how that correction should be made. The various
reforms in men’s activities which have been effected
after the facts were made known by the Pitt News and
thrown open for campus discussion were pointed out,
but were met with the retaliation that some organiza-
tions, not in need of reform, have been irreparably dam-
aged by some facts being exposed. No decision was
reached in regard to a. public censorship by women of
male organizations.

These views are important to the newspaper as well
as the organization. Any paper if it is to succeed in
being an official student publication must print all the
news on campus, political as well as social; from wom-
en's as well as men’s organizations.—M. R.

Clark Asks Equal
Treatment In
‘Journeyman’ .

By WILBUR CLARK

Many are heralding the publication
of Pitt’s literary magazine, Quill,
club’s Journeyman, especially Quill}
club members who, for the ﬁrst timer
probably, will experience the thrill of
seeing something they've written
printed. For a long time it has b-:-en
1':-;-it that the University ought to have ,
a magazine representing the literary,
endeavors of the student body. In the.
spring of '33 Quill club brought outl
the first issue of The Journeyman. It,
contained at least one selection by:
each member of the club, but no sc—l
lections by people who were not,
Quill club members. It may havei
been literary, but it was not repre-l
sentative. 

This year Quill club has announced}
that it will sponsor a contest open to}
all students, the winning manuscript,_l
or manuscripts—-it hasn’t been stated!

wl1ich—to be included in The J ourney- :

man. And so it is possible that the

magazine may be representative after-

all.

Just how representative this literary »
publication will be is a matter of spec- I

ulation. If one supposes that all lit-
erarily inclined persons are members
of Quill club, then it must follow that
the magazine will be truly representa-
tive. To those who may reject the
supposition, however, the magazine
will be representative only if the
best of all submitted manuscripts are
printed, irrespective of whether or
not the authors have lighted their
candles at Quill’s steady ﬂame

It has not been decided how many
manuscripts from outsiders will be
printed, but if selections of 45
Quill club numbers and only one or’
two pieces by outsiders are printed,,
there are many who will feel the pub-,1
lication is not entirely representa-3
tive. 

It is to be hoped that The Journey-;
man, which is to appear some time in ;
the early spring, will be truly rep-l
resentative of University students’f
abilities in creative writing, and ifl
it is really representative it deserves
the support of the student body.

it was two years
Panthers went out there with an un-
defeated team and then had the Corn-

liuskers hang on long enough to get-

a scoreless tie and throw more than a

‘tile consternation into the hearts
of folks who were counting on Pitt
for the Rose Bowl that year,

On three diﬁerent occasions when
the Pitts have gone out to Lincoln
the scoreboard keepers haven't had
to dust off anything but the goose eggs
for that day. At home, the Panthers
have fared much better against the
Huskers, winning four times while
the Nebraskans have harvested naught
Including the three scoreless ties and
a 12-7 Pitt defeat at Lincoln, the Pitt-
Nebraska record stands at four Pitt
wins, one loss, and three ties.

Nebraska’s record thus far is mar-,

red by only one defeat, that being ad-
ministered by Minnesota to the tune
of 20-0. The Cornhuskers shocked
‘»Vyoming by a 50-0 count in the open-
ing game, then lost to the Gophers,

and followed that with a squeaky 14--

3 victory over the men from Iowa
university, Oaklahoma was downed
next, 6-0, and then Iowa State at-
tempted to avenge the defeat suffered
by their good friends of Iowa. They
failed by just the same measure, los-
ing to the Huskers by one point, 7-6.

Bernie Bierman and a Minnesota
scout expressed a belief on their re-
cent visit here that when Nebraska's
green line gained a little more ex-
perience and could offer more help to
the good set of backs Coach Bible has
assembled the Huskers would make
plenty of trouble for somebody.

Of great delight to Panther followers
as the season swings on to the end
has been the showing of Leon Shed-
losky and Arnold Greene. These two
boys got their first big chance to show
something in the game with Notre
Dame Saturday. Shedlosky contribut-
ed some fancy open-ﬁeld running and
Greene did just about everything a
Pitt quarterback is expected to do.
X-Vith one good performance under
their belts, these two fellows may
keep right on going and cause a con-
i‘-le of the-regulars to look out for
their jobs before the season is over.

In all probability, however, Suther-
land will use the same starting ag-
gregation against the Huskers that he
opened with against Notre Dame.

State Yearlings Are Reported To
Have Exceptional Outﬁt

Emerging from the West Virginia
tussle last Friday at Morgantown
with only a few minor injuries, the
Panther freshman footballteam set-
tled down to a. week of hard practice
before meeting the Penn Sta.te year-
lings this Saturday at State College.

The f1‘0Sll team showed a marked
improvement in its appearance last
week over the previous week when
they were defeated, 13-0, by Kiski.
But as greatly as they have improved,
another improvement this week is ne-
cessary before they can expect to
down the boys from State college.
State’s freshies are reputed to have
one of the best freshman teams ever
assembled there. ‘

Thus fa.r in the season, the Penn
State frosh team has won all of its
three games by a decisive margin.
Last Saturday the Penn State eleven
literally walked all over the Bucknell
freshman team, winning, 31-6,

Meanwhile, the Panther frosh have
not fared quite so well. In their three
games, they boast a 12-0 victory over
Carnegie Tech, an upset loss to Kiski,
13-51, and a 14-14 tie with West Vir-
ginia. .

The squad will leave here Saturday
morning at 6 o’clock by bus. This
will enable them to arrive in plenty
of time before the game.

Twenty-Six Candidates Report At
Stadium For First Drill

Twenty-six candidates reported for
the varsity riﬂe team at the initial
tryouts held at the Stadium riﬂe
range last Monday. Of the twenty-six
candidates reporting, a majority of
them were sophomores this year,

Isergeant Guntner is doubtful that
the male student body understands
completely the requirements for the
candidates. It is not necessary for
the candidate to be a member of the
school's ROTC, nor is it necessary for
rim to be a freshman. Any man in
the University is. eligible for the
team, provided that he has had pre-
vious experience with riﬂes.

Tryouts will be continued for sev-
eral weeks, from one o’clock to five
o’clock every school day except Fri-
day. There are ﬁve prone positions
at which the candidate must try his
hand. .

The schedule for this year’s riﬂe
team is as yet incomplete but; it is
expected to be an extremely-difﬁcult
one for the marksmen_ The squad
this year will be built around seven of

will make you feel refi-esh_ed—as good as new. And science adds
conﬁrmation of this “energizing effect.” Camels aren’t ﬂat or
“sweetisli,” either. You can smoke Camels steadily. Their ﬁner,

He chuckles his way to your heart. You’ll love him as a quaint Ken-
tucky Judge-—wl1o tempers justice with kindness-—and salts kindness
with wit—in a picture as mellow as a mint julep——and with twice the
kick. You'll want to ﬂing your hat into the air and shout with ioy.
You’ll want to cheer this Judge whose simple words and simple soul

move a whole town to tears and laughter. '

the two remaining places along with
Tost, Howe, Vvalmsley, and Leggin.

Fresh from its surprising victory in
the AMA meet last week-end, the
freshman team will prepare for an
engagement with the Penn State
yearlings next Monday. Kishpaugh,
freshman runner, who was missing
from the Panther line-up last week
due to conﬁnement in the hospital for
observation, will probably be in shape
to run. The fact that in the AMA

Committee Plans
Menus To Aid
Coed ‘Chefs’

As an aid to campus organizations
planning to give lunches or dinners,
the social committee of VVSGA, under
the chairmanship of Martha Marsh,
Ed36, has prepared a list of market-
wise menus, giving the amounts of
food needed, the number to be served
and the cost per person. This list is
on ﬁle at Heinz House for use of all
University students.

Nine different luncheon menus are
planned for groups of nine to 28 per-
sons and cost 25 cents each.

Not only are menus listed, but also
rules of etiquette governing the set-
ting of a table, serving and proper
behavior for both hostess and guests.

“Being a true hostess is showing
true hospitality, making people wel-
come to what one has without appar-
ent effort.” Miss Marsh said, “She
must show impartial attention to all
of her guests and see that none are
being negnlected, cover any mishaps
and divert the attention to something
else, lead the conversation into safe
channels and be gracious at all times.”
