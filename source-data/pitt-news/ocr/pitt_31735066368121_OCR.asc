the organization formed last
year by the merger of Pitt Pro-
fessional Union and the univer-
sity chapter of the American
Association of University

among faculty in the Provost’s
area on whether collective bar-
gaining should be instituted at
I’itt.

Other officers elected were:
James Cunningham, vice presi-
dent; Mark McColloch, secre-
tary; and Robert Campbell,
treasurer.

Grants Due

The deadline for applica-
tions for major teaching devel-
opment grants, which range

Curriculum Reforms

Working Smoothly

By PEGGY FERRI

The curriculum reforms that
were hotly debated last year are
working out smoothly this year,
(JAS dean Irwin Schulman said in
an interview after his update to a
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
meeting. I ‘

The writing and mathamatics
requirements were implemented
this fall. As a result of the place-
ment tests, approximately 40 per-
cent of incoming freshmen were
required to take an algebra course
and approximately 5 percent were
required to take basic reading and
writing courses, according to
Schulman. _ .

In addition to the stronger writ-
ing, mathematics and foreign lan-
guage requirements approved of
last fall, a more defined distribu-
tion of studies in the humanities,
social sciences and natural sciences
was approved. These general edu-
cation requirements will take effect
next fall and the foreign language
requirements will be implemented
in fall 1984. ‘‘

‘‘It’s kind of disappointing that
students after 12 years in high

school can come here without the V

ability to write a decent essay,"
Schulman said. “We're not unique‘
in trying to improve those skills in
our students." Pitt is in accordance
with a national trend in strength-

"courses

ening its curriculum, he said.

Pitt has informed several high
schools of these reforms and urged
them to encourage their students to
take serious courses in their senior
year of high school, Schulman
said.

foreign language requirements are
not scheduled to take affect until
1984, freshmen were still tested to
see what they retained from high
school. Approximately 60 percent
would have been required to take
foreign language courses, accord-
ing to Schulman. He added that the
university has talked to high
schools, urging them to encourage
their students to take foreign lan-
guage courses.

As part of the curriculum
reform, six committees were estab-
lished, each consisting of faculty
and students. These committees are
developing and reviewing course
proposals in anticipation of the
1983 implementation of the gen-
eral education requirements.

Schulman said that the faculty is
doing a good job in developing
that meet the new
requirements.

“We hope to have a large variety
of courses and smaller classes,”
Schulman said. He added that stu-
dents will still receive a broad edu-

Despite Trend, Foreign Enrollmentsteady

Foreign student enrollment at
Pitt has continued to rise steadily
the past few years, a fact which con-

trasts with a survey conducted by
the Institute of International
Education.

The institute’s annual census of
foreign students found 326,299 en-

The cost of books has
increased, and the cancellation
of the book sale in Schenley
Hall has further exacerbated the
situation making it difficult for
students to buy the books they
need, but the University
Honors Program Student
Cabinet (UHPSC) is seeking to
change that.

“The cabinet wants to serve
students in these crucial eco-
nomic times,” UHPSC chair-
man Bob DeAng_elis said.
“Besides helping honors stu-
dents in particular, the book
sale will help to familiarize stu-
dents with the Honors Program

to them."

Registration for books begins
today and runs until October
29. Students can drop off their

so that it will seem less foreign —

books at Honors Program, 1209
Cathedral of Learning, where
they will receive a receipt and
set the prices they want for their
books, according to DeAngelis.
DeAnglis said that the
UHPSC is looking for books
that were used in honors
courses and has solicited books '
from the humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences.
“We are offering a free service
to students,” he explained.
“The students set their own pri-
ces for their books, and they
receive that full amount if their
books are sold.” V
The book sale, in the Honors
Program, runs from Nov. 1
through Nov. 3, between the
hours of 10 and 3 according to
DeAngelis.
The honors program admin-
istration supports the idea espe-

tutions; this is a 4.6 increase over
1980-81. Over the last six years, the
annual increase rate varied from

eight to 16 percent. So, while the’
percentage of foreign students is
not dropping dramatically, it is
slowing up.

At a recent meeting of the Ameri-
can Council on Education (ACE),-
the slowdown of foreign students
was attributed to the sizable
decrease in the number of Iranian
students. During 1980-81, 47,555
Iranian students were enrolled in
American schools; that figure fell
to 35,860 during the last academic
year.

Ralph Morrison, Pitt’s foreign
student adviser, said almost all
American universities and com-
munity colleges had a similar five
percent increase last year. That
information was from a survey
conducted by the Institute of
Higher Education’s periodical,
Open Doors.

“The number actually
increased overall,” he said, “but
not by very much.”

Morrison said there are approxi-
mately 1,700 foreign students, from
102 different countries, enrolled at
Pitt. Four-fifths of the students are
in various graduate school pro-
grams, and most are Nigerian, he
said.

The schools that are most popu-
lar, he said, are Business, Engineer-
ing, Library and Information

Science and GSPIA. among others.

When Morrison came to Pitt six
years ago, the foreign student pop-
ulation was 750. He said the 1,000
student increase over that time was
due to outside governmen'
assistance.

“It depends on the country,” re
said. “Some are here taking three-
or six-month certificate courses.
Then they go back home and
become business leaders or
involved in their local communi-

H

UCS.

The ACE conference noted an
increase from some OPEC nations;
including Ecquador, Indonesia,
Venezuela and Nigeria. Other big
OPEC -countries—Algeria, Libya
and Saudi Arabia—showed a
decline in the number of students
sent to the U.S.

Over 60 percent of the foreign
students at Pitt are sponsored by
their government, Morrison said.
He cited the federal government’s
recent disinterest in funding
foreigners.

“The government has different
priorities," he said. “Besides, home
countries readily support students

because they later become
involved.”
This figure correlates, to a

degree, with ACE figures. Accord-
ing to the ACE, 15 percent of all
foreign students benefited from
large amounts of U.S. government-
or university-backed financial aid.

Schulman‘ said that although the

Albert Van Dusen

By GREG PETRO

Few Pitt students are
likely to understand what
the phrase “it's lonely at the
top” means. Some stu-
dents—after graduation,
and after years of hard work,
shattered hopes and lucky
breaks—may find them-
selves at the top of a corpora-
-tion or a university.

Dr. Albert C. Van Dusen,
vice-chancellor emeritus
and professor, is a man who
has been there and knows
what it is like.

Van Dusen serves as a spe-
cial assistant in the universi-
ty’s Office of Public Affairs.
He is proud to have been
able to assist in the process of
establishing the Graduate
School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs. His amia-
ble personality and wide
variety of expereinces make
him an ideal “good will”
ambassador for the univer-
sity on the local, national
and international levels:
according to Dr. Bernard
Kobosky, vice-chancellor for
public affairs.

“His major contribution
has been a great sense of

commitment and devotion
to the university as well as to
the students,” Kobosky said.

Van Dusen expressed his
philosophy, saying “I try to
avoid insulation from the
students as an administrator
because I do like young peo-
p1e’s company, and I am try-
ing to make this university a
human place in which stu-
dents can mature into caring
human beings and effective
citizens, as well as compe-
tent graduates.”

Van Dusen’s efforts to
break out of the ivory tower
of the administrative system
have led him to chair the
Board of Directors at WQED
and to chair the Pitt United
Way Drive this fall.

“I am pleased to direct the
United Way Drive,” Van
Dusen said. “As chairman of
the Board of Directors of the
Health and Welfare Associa-
tion of Allegheny County, I
saw the good things the Uni-
ted Way does, and I wanted
to get directly involved and
help.

“I am pleased that we are a
little ahead compared to last
year in participation as well
as money. I am not inter-

Profi/e:A/berz‘ Van Dusen Keeps In Touch

ested in competition, but I
am happy because a greater
need is being met,” Van
Dusen said.

Van Dusen came to Pitt in
1956 as a professor of psy-
chology, education and bus-
iness administration.
Although he is semi-retired
from his administrative
duties, he is pleased to main-
tain his role as an educator.

“It gives me the opportun-
ity to keep in touch with the
students’ and it keeps me
young,” Van Dusen said.

Van Dusen held several
vice-chancellor positions
until 1971 when he was
appointed to the highly
prestigious position of secre-
tary of the university, which
he held until 1980. The
secretary of the university
provides staff support to the
Board of Trustees and to the
chancellor. On Feb. 10, 1982,
Dr. Van Dusen was named
vice-chancellor emeritus by
the Board of Trustees.

“Being a student’s friend
is a fringe benefit because
not only is it personally
rewarding consulting stu-.
dents, but
young,” Van Dusen said.

Schulman: Reforms

cation. liven with the additional
general education and skills
requirements, the student will still
have room in his schedule for

» flexibility.

“In the whole college program
of 120 credits, one third is the
major, one third is the general edu-
cation and skills and the last third
is up to the student," Schulman
explained.

He said that the reforms have
received the support of both the
faculty and the alumni.

The faculty is seriously inter-
ested in developing courses to meet
the requirements, according to
Schulman. He said that the philo-
sophy department, for example,

moothly

has come up with some good ele-
tnentary philosophy courses.

Schulman said he expects the
committees to have a list of
approved courses ready soon.

The FAS meeting at which
Schulman made his report was not
attended by many people when
compared to the large crowds that
the meetings drew last fall. Only 25
persons attended the meeting.
Schulman said that that is not
because people are not interested or
disagree with the reforms.

“There is just nothing contro-
versial to vote on this year," he
said. “I would have been very sur-
prised to have seen more people
attend.”

He added that the UHPSC is
optimistic about the sale and
feels that the need for it is clear.

“The service will be con-
tinued in future terms depend-
ing on how successful we are
this time,” DeAngelis said.
“Planning for it took two
months."

The UHPSC is a partially
recognized group that serves as
a liaison between the honors
program and the honors stu-
dents, according the DeAngelis,
“We aim to represent student

- interests, organize activities and

serve the student body at Pitt,
honors students in particular,”
he explained.-

The book sale is a continua-
tion of the UHPSC policy to
serve the students, according to
DeAngelis. He said that the

An exhibit and sale of Warner

 Brothers Disney Art Collection

will be on display in the main
lobby of Schenley Hall, Oct. 25
and 26, 10 a.m. through 7 p.m.

Sponsored by the Pitt Pro-
gram Council, the collection
comprises more than 250 ani-
mation “cel” paintings. The
cels are paintings actually
filmed in making animated car-
toons. Each character is painted
by hand on a clear sheet of ace-
tate, usually 11” x‘ 14” or larger,
placed against a background
and photographed, one by one,
to produce a reel of motion pic-
ture film.

The exhibit, authenticated by
Gallery Lainzberg of Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, highlights the
work of two veteran Warner

Brothers producer-directors,
Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng.
Their talents have produced
characters such as Wile E.
Coyote, the Roadrunner, Pepe
le Pew, Tweety, Sylvester and
Yosemite Sam. Other creations
that Jones and Freleng have
produced are Bugs Bunny,
Daffy Duck and the Tasmanian
Devil.

Also on exhibit will be cel
paintings from some Walt Dis-
ney films including “The jun-
gle Book,” “Robin Hood,"
“Rescuers” and “The Fox and
the Hound." A selection of vin-
tage Disney animal drawings
from the 19305 and 19405,
including a few choice draw-
ings of Mickey Mouse, will also
be offered. A representative of
Gallery Lainzberg will be on
hand to answer questions.

The exhibit is free and open

The Pitt News, Monday October 25, 1982

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

There exist many build-
ings within the city of Pitts-
burgh. These buildings are
in business for the sole pur-
pose of accommodating peo-
ple's specific needs.

These needs are served by
restaurants, business offices,
and in many cases, elevators.
These moving pieces of
human construction often
go unnoticed by the every
day visitor to the taller build-
ings. The elevators maintain
a balance of people who
have to live or work in the
buildings.

The elevators’ name is
quite appropriate since it is
their job to elevate -or lower
people to the desired floor.
This job is accomplished by
a series of cables and pulleys
that is attached to the outside
of the elevator. It is this part
of the elevator that is seldom
seen by the average rider,
except perhaps in a James
Bond movie where the secret
agent tries to escape from an
attacker by climbing out of
the top.

But for most elevator users
the escape route is usually
found by walking out the
door. The elevator’s elec-
tronic eyes wait for their
beams to be broken so that
the door may slide open. It is
often found that the beams
are broken just in time to
prevent the patron from
being sandwiched between
the doors.

It is interesting to take
note of the many varieties of
elevators. They have often
been used on television and
in the movies to heighten the
suspense of the story. While
in other times they serve as a
showpiece that offers the
viewer a point of reference.

An interesting example of
the latter can be found on the
now defunct television series
“Petticoat Juncion.” The
series revolved around the
inhabitants of the Shadyrest
Hotel, ' ‘which, like some
smaller hotels, had an old
iron elevator in the back-
ground. However, at no time
in the series’ existence was
the elevator used.-

This was explained in the
series by one of the charac-
ters, Uncle Joe. He told a vis-
itor to the hotel that it had
been broken for a long time

but had never been fixed.
When asked, since it hadn’t
been fixed, why have it
around, Uncle Joe quipped,
“What kind of hotel would
this be without an elevator?”

Another type of elevator

was recently installed at the
Westinghouse headquarters
in Pittsburgh. This particu-
lar elevator, developed by
Westinghouse, has the abil-
ity to respond to a vocal com-
mand to go to the desired
floor. All one need do is tell
the elevator what floor he
would like to go to, and the
elevator will go up or down
accordingly.

The average University of .
Pittsburgh elevator can’t
compare with these eleva-
tors. The university’s eleva-
tors have developed a
reputation of their own.

The Towers elevators are
an example of what every
elevator should not be like.
The riders of these elevators
have known that the times
when the elevators do work
are times to cherish.
Although the stench often
found inside these elevators
can be overpowering it does
have a natural origin—such
as the natural putrescence of
food, beer and, on occasion,
vomit.

The Student Union’s ele-
vators offer a lesson in neces-
sity since anyone using the
stairwells has to have a hard-
hat. But the interesting

aspect of I the Student
Union’s elevators is that they
are the only part of the build-
ing that hasn’t been
reconstructed.

The highlightof elevators

on campus may be found in

tunts look for terntwes or elevators on campus.

I,
the Cathedral of Learning.
The building has many ele-
vators for different purposes.

There is an elevator that is
to be used exclusively for the
janitorial staff, four to be
used by people who want to
travel to the first half of the
building and another four
for people who want access
to the upper part of the
Cathedral.

At rush hour, these eleva-
tors give their patrons a new
perspective on the old game
of sardines. Bodies are
packed in tightly but all try
to avoid each other by hold-
ing their arms in close. It can
be hard at times to find room
on an elevator, but there is
always another one coming
along.

There have been many
horror stories inspired by
experiences of riding in the
Cathedral’s elevators.

A student who was taking
a summer course in the
building decided to stay after
class so that he could study.
It was in the early evening
when he decided to leave,
and most other people had
already left.

The student (who wishes
to remain anonymous) got

  The Exploration of Campus Elevators

on the elevator intending to
do to the ground floor. He
pushed the button on the ele-
vator’s panel and was soon
on his way.

As the elevator began to
move the student noticed
that it wasn’t running as
smoothly as it had when he
had travelled on it before,
butsensing no danger, he

continued his ride. It was --

just after the elevator had
passed the first floor that it
came to a complete halt. He
was caught between floors.

To add to his problems,
this student’s claustropho-
bia began to play on his
nerves. He pushed the emer-
gency button on the panel
and, to his surprise, there
was no response. He con-
tinued to press the button for

15 minutes, and still there
was no response.

It was at this point that the
student began to call out for
help. Half an hour later,
someone neard his shouting
and phoned for assistance.

There are of course other
experiences on the Cathed-
ral’s elevators. One reached
the tenth floor and then
began ,to fall; "another
reached its destination but
refused to open. ,

These events offer unique
travel experiences, but there
are other things a person
should know while riding
on elevators, especially at
Pitt.

It was George Carlin who
said that there is nothing to
do while on an elevator
except “not look at the other
guy.” While riding the ele-
vators of the university, there
are indeed many things that
can be done on a elevator.
The most important is try-
ing to avoid touching
another person.

This can be a challenging
experience since the univer-
sity’s elevators are heavily
travelled. But it is interesting
that this is the main pastime
while on one of the universi-
ty’s elevators.

Another pastime involves
trying not to utter a sound
while in a filled elevator.
This is occasionally ignored
by people who have gotten
on an elevator together and
are continuing a conversa-
tion. But in most cases, the
conversation usually sub-
sides, and the patrons
become as tight-lipped as the
other people in the elevator.

for all of us!

 

Although not as well known
in the United States as baseball,
football or basketball, orien-
teering is nevertheless a sport of
Olympic status, engaged in by
such international champions
as Rodger Bannister of Eng-
land, who first broke the 4-
ininute-inile barrier.

Orienteering can be likened
to a treasure hunt. It involves
navigating cross—countrv over

at .

uiifamiliar terrain with a map
and compass in order to locate
control markers in a competi-
tive race.

Besides being an accredited
Pitt course in the physical edu-
cation department, orienteer-
ing is part of the ROTC
training program. This group
spent the weekend orienteering
in Clinton, Pa., near the
airport.

 

There’s not much else to do but eat when you’re spending your weekend orienteering.

FAST
Move

While Pitt’s idea of encouraging collaborative research
efforts with industry is interesting because of its potential,
it’s also one that should be approached with caution.

The Board of Trustees last week approved the establish-
ment of a university-owned corporation whose objectives
are to link university researchers and their industry coun-
terparts. It will be called the Foundation for Applied

Science and Technology (FAST) and will be related to the .

already existing Center for Applied Science and Technol-
ogy (CAST). I y

The benefits from FAST are these: it will provide a
means for the university to acquire an ownership position
in products resulting from faculty research; it will provide
greater stability in funding because as a non-profit corpor-
ation it could keep the revenue earned through its spon-

sored research projects; and it will allow faculty members I

who independently devise patentable inventions to pursue
them through FAST’s patent committee as an alternative
to the university’s patent committee.

"With the establishment of FAST, we have created a
mechanism for the support of technological innovation
which extends from conceptual innovation through proof
of feasibility,” Pitt chancellor Wesley Posvar told the
trustees.

FAST has created other mechanisms as well, and some
of them are what’s causing the concern.

A senate committee is particularly worried that FAST’s
promise for “research for profit” may lure Pitt professors
away from their research. In a report on the Planning
Resource Managament Systems Proposal (PRMS) on
FAST, the committee noted several flaws. Among them
was the idea that using Pitt talent for private-sector app-
lied research was counter to the purposes of the university.
This same fear was mentioned by consumer advocate
Ralph Nader in a speech at Pitt earlier this year. Nader
said that the ties between universities and corporations

y can compromise academic freedom.

The senate committee also mentioned that FAST could
possibly mean a return to secret research, which is banned
at Pitt, and that it may cause a reduction in state aid or
drain university resources.

Although Posvar told the Senate Council that no secret
research would be conducted and that faculty members
would be appointed to FAST’s board of directors, that is as
specific as he would get. As to the larger question of
‘compromising academic freedom, Posvar only said that
“attention will be given to these concerns.”

That statement, taken with a less than comprehensive
PRMS proposal for FAST, means that academicians and
others had better keep a sharp eye on FAST. It’s obviously
something the university administration wanted, (for its
financial benefits), and, because of the trustees’ actions last
week, it’s something it’s gotten. There’s a real possibility
that FAST may turn out to be a little too quick for its
critics.

SGB And Special Interests

By RON BARBER

The last installment of this
column suggested that certain stu-
dent groups exerted varying
amounts of influence in last year’s
Student Government Board (SGB)
election- More precisely, I found
that some groups’ endorsements of
candidates were useful in predict-
ing the outcome of the election. To
continue the examination of last
year’s race, I now ask: Were the
positions of candidates on issues
during the campaign useful in pre-
dicting the outcome of
election?

My source for the issues and
respective stands of the candidates
is the series of candidate profiles
published on Nov. 13, 1981 in The
Pitt News. Of the issues reported
there on which candidates differed,
only two were addressed by a suffi-
cient number of candidates’ to be
useful in this investigation.

The first issue concerned
allocations-—some candidates feel-
ing that SGB should exercise more
care in making allocation deci-
sions, others feeling satisfied with
the current process. The second
issue concerned the curriculum
changes approved by the faculty
last year——some candidates approv-
ing of the entire package, some dis-

approving of the entire package

and others supporting all but the
foreign language requirements.
The number of student group
endorsements a candidate received
showed a rather strong correlation
with that candidate’s ranking in
the vote totals (0.44), while a candi-
date’s stand on the allocation or
curriculum issue showed less corre-
lation (0.10 and 0.38 respectively).
This suggests that endorsements
were somewhat more important to
voters than issues. In other words, a
candidate with important endorse-
ments was likely to score well even

the

with unpopular positions on
issues. A candidate with popular
views may score poorly without
important endorsements.

Issue stands were more useful in
predicting the rankings among
candidates without I important
endorsement; that is, positions on
the issues helped to explain why
some candidates with few endorse-
ments ‘received more votes than
other candidates with few endorse-
ments. For instance, when endorse-
ment by the Engineering Student
Cabinet was factored out, correla-

‘...a candidate with important
endorsements was likely to
score well even with unpopu-

.lar positions on issues.’

tion between stands on the alloca-
tion issue and votes nearly doubled
in this analysis.

These figures do not suggest that
issues were unimportant in the
election. In fact, the curriculum
reform issue appears to have been
almost as important as endorse-
ments in deciding the outcome of
the election. Rather than unimpor-
tant issues seem to have been of
secondary importance to the influ-
ence of group endorsements. A can-
didate could result from a number
of group endorsements.

One may argue here that groups
made their endorsement decisions
on the basis of candidates’ posi-
tions on issues, and therefore issues
were of primary importance in the
election. This is a plausible sugges-
tion, but it is one thatraises further
questions about SGB elections and
election politics.

First, because the endorsing
groups (with the partial exception
of The Pitt news) did not publicize
their reasons for making endorse-
ment decisions, the voter is left to
guess at what issues were consid-

Too Tanked To Notice

Dear Edi tor:

To the So-Called Pitt Panther
Football Fans:

What are you booing about?
Thirty eight points on the

. scoreboard is more than satisfa-

ctory for me and the gang from
South ()akIand. Danny, 3-I-I
yards, 26 for 36 is GREAT?!
What are you fans going to do

, next year when Pitt just may

not be ranked No. 2, No. 3 or
even No. I0 in the nation? Do

1 you expect Danny to pull off the

ultimate play on every down? If
we never had the sinall-gainiiig
downs, we would not appre-
ciate the great plays. If you need
something to boo about, try
booing someone like the
Tylenol killer or the NFL
strike.

Danny, you can find your
fans from South Oakland hang-
ing in the end zone and believe
me. you will hear no boos from
us.

ered and what positions were
favored. Comparisons of candi-
dates based on issues reported by

I The Pitt News could only take

place on two issues. (Two other
issues—the proposed fraternity
housing complex and the role of
commuter students in SGB—were
addressed by only two candidates.)
Thus, if the above argument is cor-
rect, it would seem that other issues
were discussed in influential
endorsement hearings, and these
discussions affected the outcome of
the election, yet this information
was not made available to the
voters.

A second issue arises from my
speculation as to what issues were,
in fact, considered in endorsement
hearings. It would seem only natu-
ral to assume (and my own expe-
riences last year in endorsement
hearings confirm) that Group A
will endorse candidates who are
likely to be responsive to Group A’s
needs——needs which may be
expressed in the form of funding
requests or appeals for other types
of assistance in furthering Group
A’s goals.

My research suggests that, in
SGB elections, some groups are
able to further their interests to a
degree greater than their size in
proportion to the student body
suggests. In other words, I agree
with the above argument to the
extent that special interest issues
are important in the making of
endorsement decisions. But I must
conclude, as the research presented
here suggests, that a candidate’s
stands on broader issues during last
year’s SGB campaign were less sig-
nificant in determining his stand-
ing in the vote tallies than the
number of endorsements received.

(Editor’s note: Ron Barber ran
unsuccessfully in last year’s SGB
election. His column will be
appearing regularly.)

More Than Just The Muscles

Dear Editor:

In the Monday, Oct. l8 issue of
The Pitt News, managing editor
Christina Clinton lashed out
against sexism in some ‘of today's
music. In her criticism of such
music, she failed on two accounts.

First, if she is going to talk about
today's music, or any topic for that
matter, she had better know her
subject well or at least appear to
know it. Miss Clinton (Ms.?) made
several factual errors in her editor-
ial. The words to The Who's new
release, “Athena”, are, “She’sjusta
girl—she's a bomb,” not “she’s a
whore" as she stated. The correct
lyrics appeared in the Entertain-
ment section of The New York
Times, in a review of the album,
“It’s Hard.” I’m not sure of what
Pete Townshend means by calling
the girl a bomb, but being called
one isn’t remotely the same as
being called a whore.

A second misquote involved
both the title and lyrics of a Donnie
Iris song. “Quit your bitching, get
back in the kitchen” were the
words Miss Clinton chose as the
title of the tune. Actually, the title
is “I Can’t Hear You," and Miss
Clinton's title was a misquote of a
line in this song, “stop all your
bitching, back in the kitchen.”
Granted, this is a subtle difference,
but again, a factual error.

The Tra

By JEFFREY’ HERMAN

When I heard that Ronald Rea-
gan’s son was in an unemployment
line amidst old men with union

Chats and cancer, I was surprised.

Johnny Carson will probably con-
tinue to poke fun at the kid’s effe-
minacy, and the dancers on all the
C-teams will keep talking about
influence—or lack of it. I couldn’t
tell if Mr. Reagan was, as usual,
oblivious to the whole thing. It was
difficult reading through the lines
of the “People Column” of the
Post. It seems a mockery is being
made of trying not to notice it’s the
president’s son. We all seem to’
think that it shouldn’t make the
least bit of difference. I

We have to think that way, and
I’m sure the world is filled with

sympathetic people. It’s funny, .

though, that some people ‘get hold
of a bunch of information that isn’t
significant, so it is given to us in
what surely is called the Star sec-
tion by news-seeking citizens. The
story is in the paper—-with big
pictures—and we all talk about it
as if it were some kind of ironic
joke the playwrights of govern-
ment had played on us. News that
isn’t news is made news by the mere
fact that it isn't news.

There was a picture included

more than) 25 ignorant undergrad-

uates who choose to plaster in)’

Secondly, with the advent of
“Women's Liberation," someone
made a wonderful discovei'y:,sex—
ism also encompasses sexual dis-
crimination against men. Of
course there are some instances,
you may think, Miss Clinton, btit

 

there are probably more than you
may think. Staying on your chosen
subject of music, the current single
by Diana Ross, “Muscles,” is bla-
tantly sexist against men. She
doesn’t want just any, she wants
one with muscles from head to toe.
Everyone has muscles from head to
toe, if you want to be a language
purist, but we all know what she
means. In addition to being sexist,
it is also Miss Ross’ worst song,
considering her long list of beauti-
ful melodic songs. It ranks with
()livia’s “Heart Attack” as two of

icF|aw

there, so I can tell you the men had
union hats, though I had no idea
what kind of hats they really were.
It’s just a lot of fun for us to look at

g the world as if it were a movie, to

analyze the individuals’ parts and
then come to a conclusion that
boldly declares the tragic flaw. Is it
not tempting to believe that
Ronald Reagan is using his son as
a dupe? And that Ron Reagan (the

other one) is subject to criticism.

because he really does not have that
much to worry about?

Many people who pursue careers
in an art field aren’t always
employed, so why should Ron
Reagan be any different? Also, if he
is in the dumps, shouldn’t his
father help him? Why is Ron Rea-
gan claiming unemployment
when his rather rich father could be
helping him out? If I were to lose a

job, before I ran to the unemploy—,

merit office, my father would help
me. He would also be doinga lot of
job searching.

It is sad that we cast our leaders
into such positions that we deny
them the right to live. Maybe the
English sing “God Save the
Queen” because they already know
the way in which they killed roy-
alty.

the most annoying and asinine
songs currently receiving airplay.

This all boils down to one thing:
singers and songwriters most often
perform and write songs which
express their personal opinion on a
given subject. It is highly doubtful
that the cruising teens you spoke of
will form the exact opinions of the
songs just because they hear the
songs five times daily.

()ii a personal note, I once told a
girl I'd dated that the song “She’s
Always a Woman" reminded me of
her. Thinking about it fora min-
ute, she said, “Yeah, I guess you're
right,” and then apologized.

A song sells and is liked for sev-
eral reasons: the melody, the beat
and yes, the words. Songs can cause
dance crazes (the freak, the hustle),
fads (Valley Girls), but “The Wall"
(the song) caused no great surge in
the dropout rate or student revolts.
Music is entertainment. If a song
doesn’t entertain yoti, turn it off,
don't go out and buy the 45.

Sexism, as well as other discriini—
nation, will exist as long as there
are two sexes and several races, reli-
gions and social classes. No song or
movie or person can change the
minds of everyone in the world, not
even the irresponsible joiirnalisiri

of Miss Clinton.

More
Meaning

Dear Editor: ‘

Upon reading the editorial, “For

What It Is Worth,” in The Pitt
News on Oct. 18, I was quite
surprised.
This astonishment came not from
the point she made in her column
but from her facts. Namely, consid-
ering the rock group The Who at
the same level as “pop" rockers (?)
like Hall and Oates. The correct
lyrics of The Who song she cited,
“Athena,” are “She's just a girl,
she’s a bomb.” The editor thought
the word “bomb” was “whore.”

The song, in too few words, is
about a country’s “love affair"
with the nuclear bomb. Realizing
this, the song indeed has a new and
important meariing. I guess the
fact that Ms. Clinton thought they
said whore and her misunderstand-
ing of the whole song make her a
victim of this sexism she is so intich
against.

If Miss Clinton had ever

This is a response to Mr.
White's reply to the question,
“Is Pitt a Party School?”, in the
Oct. 22 issue of The Pitt News.

Granted, Mr. White, that
being a first year student makes
you of a “man of the world,"
what right do you have to say
that we, females, are all football
groiipies and teasers? We do not
consider ourselves hero wor-
shippers, nor do we feel we have
a need to inflate our egos.

We, the women of Pitt, wish
to ask you a question, “What
are you doing at the bars in the
first place, since you are only a
freshmen?” Evidently, you do
not pay attention in bars to see

there is some interaction-

White, are too busy getting
tanked and throwing up on
your shoes to notice. Bars area
place to meet new people and
have a nice time. They are not a
place to get so drunk that you
become a menace to an inno-
cent bystander! I suppose that
in time you will realize this

In short, Mr. White, look to
yourself for the answer. If a girl
does not talk to you, it may be
because you are too busy wip-
ing something off of your shoes.

Dear Editor:

This letter is in response to Chris-
tina Clinton's article entitled, “For
What It is Worth,” which appeared
in The Pitt News on Oct. 15. Here’s
to you, Ms. Clinton. Another fine,
well-researched, unbiased and accu-
rate report.

Yes, today’s rock stars feel
women are whores, users, back-
stabbers and liars, and no one writes
songs about a good experience with
a woman anymore. This is evi-
Idenced quite clearly by Styx’s.
“Babe” Queen's “Love of My life,”
and almost any Air Supply song
you choose to listen to. If you don’t
like those, try listening to ]ourney’s
“Stone In Love."

Ah, yes, the heroes of today’s
youth. What self-respecting kid.
would idolize a baseball or football
player~after they had the gall to go
on strike? What happened to the
actors and actresses who were wor-
shipped? Oh, Iforgot. No onegoes
to movies anymore; there are too
many concerts to go to.

Lesson In

Dear Editor:

Just wanted to point out a few
misconceptions (or should that be
misconceptions) in the editorial by
the managing editor of The Pitt
News:

1) Who lyrics:
she’s a bomb—(not a whore)

2) Stone's tune:

I’m not waiting on a
lady—(True! If you’ve ever seen the
video to this song, Jagger is wait-
ing for Keith Richards)

Indeed, I must agree that there is
a decided amount of pure sexism in

Listen To The Music

You stated, Ms. Clinton, that it
took Mick Jagger 40 years to “real-
ize that woineii aren’t bad." A more
accurate statement would have been
that he realized that all women
aren’t bad. '

You failed to mention any female
vocalists. Have you ever listened to
Pat Benatar? If not, try this lineup
for starters—-—“Promises In the
Dark,” “Fire and Ice” and “Hit Me
With Your Best Shot.” Not satis-
fied? Try Quarterflash’s “Harden
My Heart" and “Find Another
Fool.” You still haven't heard
enough? Listen to the Waitresses’ “I

Know What Boys Like.” Come on, -

men, let's revolt. We shouldn’t have
to put up with this abuse. These
sexist songs'shouldn’t be allowed
on the airwaves! _ 4,

One more thing, Ms. Clinton.
The next time you attack one of the
world's greatest lyric writers, quote
him corectly. The words to
“Athena" are, “She's just a girl-—
she’s a bomb,” not “a whore,” as
you misquoted.

‘ Serafino Dante “Foge” Fazio
stood atop a table tucked away deep
inside the Carrier Dome. Pitt had
just defeated -Syracuse 14-0. The
same question was again asked of
Fazio for no fewer than the third.
time: “Are you satisfied with only a V
14-point victory?”

Fazio, normally a mild-

Syracuse Orangemen, 14-0. ’

The defense kept the Orangemen
from crossing Pitt's 26-yard line.

 against a defense that has yielded

nearly 30 points a game for the past

the outcome was still in doubt
throughout much of the fourth
quarter. ~

No fewer than two times had
Panther fullback Bill Beach been
stopped short on fourth-and-one
plunges inside the Syracuse 30.

Pitt coach Foge Fazio blamed
himself for those plays, saying, “I
should have kicked field goals.”

More telling was Fazio's coni-
inent, “We didn’t knock anyone
over, and our fullback couldn’t
climb over anyone.”

At times, the Panther offense
appeared confused, evidenced by
Pitt using three timeouts in the
first quarter and a half. Once

 again, Fazio shared in the blame.

 “We started out well,” Fazio

said. “Dan (Marino) had things

"under control—we were moving
up and down the field.

“But," Fa1.io added, “the coach
screwed us up by not getting the
plays into the game quick enough.
I take the blame for that-—-it caused
us to lose our intensity and
continuity."

that I’m going to apologize for a
team that’s 6-0. You guys make it
sound like we’re 0-6.

“Why can't you look at the posi-

Marino controlled the first half.
Bill Fralic did a helluva job on Ron
Charles. Why don‘t you go over
and ask Charles what kind of game
Fralic played?”

‘I’m tired of people who try
to be negative after victory.
A lot of teams could have
been prime upset victims
at Syracuse. Our guys
could have cracked. No
one talks about that.’

Despite the outburst, Fazio con-
tinued to answer questions. He had
a point to make, and he made it
swiftly and steriily.

Fazio was still upset, but he was
slightly calmer after a day of reflec-
tion. The media were tainting a
Pitt victory.

“I’m tired of people who try to be
negative after victory,” Fazio was
saying yesterday. “People have a
wrong conception of weak football
teams. A lot of teams could have
been prime upset victims at Syra-
cuse. Our guys could have cracked.
No Qne talks about that.

“The media," Fazio continued,
“is just like an average fan-—they

Fazio did express some dismay
with the offense, saying that play-

Judy Gaul (12) led the Lady Panther Volleyball team to another tournament

victory.

By MARK A. SINDLER

In a four-team invitational that
was hastily shoved into its schedule
long after it was finalized, the Lady
Panther volleyball team made
quick work of its three opponents
yesterday enroute to its sixth sea-
sonal championship.

Georgetown, Seton Hall, Pitt
and Villanova all opposed each
other on the Wildcats’ home. turf,
and the Panthers emerged victor-
ious without much of a struggle.

Villanova and Seton Hall all but
“gave in” and posted identical
losses 15-1, 15-9. The Hoyas, consi-
dered Pitt’s staunchest Big East
opponent to date, did not make a
match of iti either, 15-13, 15-6.

The Panthers’ wins yesterday
vaulted them to the top of the con-
ference standings with a 4-1 mark.
The 6-0 weekend record also ea “*1€d
the squad the distinction of being
named champion of the South
Division.

“Right now we're in a perfection
period," he stated. “We are doing
everything right and maintaining
a real emotional stability. Our goal
was to beat Georgetown and we did
because we played accordingly."

The Panthers’ domination over
the Hoyas just about assures them
that they will receive the Big East's
bid for
weeks from, now. The coveted con-
ference champion will be crowned
November 13, after all eight
members meet in Providence.

While anticipating those sweet
fruits of fortune, Collier reflected
on yesterday's near-flawless play.

“We came here with a purpose —
to play well against the teams we
expected to beat,” he said. “It often
happens the other way around,
otherwise where teams who play
well do not always beat opponents
they are expected to."

Collier spoke of the team’s pres-
ent condition as “shifting into
high , ar for the NCAA’s and Big
Easts.’ Currently, the squad has a
common understanding of what
they are trying to accomplish, Col-
lier added.

From here, it will definitely be
evident what the Lady Panthers are

“shooting for — an NCAA bid.

Undoubtedly,- coach Shelton
Collier is pleased with his team’s
success, not to mention his 32-4

match record. What gave him per-‘ :5

haps the most satisfaction, though,
was handing Georgetown its latest
loss.

GAME SERVES: Collier, speak-
ing of senior Diane Zack, who led
the team with 22 kills yesterday,
“Without question she is the most
productive spiker. . . ” He spoke of
Zack and captain julie Gaul (the
team’s No. l setter) as the team’s

top tandem: “Those two know,

their roles and have reached a level
of consistency in every tournament
and every weekend . . . ” The Vil-
lanova wins this week marked the
team’s sixth seasonal champion-
ship, not last ‘week's wins, as was,

incorrectly stated in this column "

one week ago . . . The Lady Panth-
ers compete in a round-robin clas-
sic starting Thursday night against
North Carolina, North Carolina

Panthers Run Into
Stiff Competition

By CHARLIE O'HARA

The Big East Championship
proved to be just what Panther
coach john Vasvary had predicted
it might be—the competition was a
little above the Panthers‘ heads.

Providence ran according to its
billing winning the championship
with an incredible 21 points. Provi-

gdence placed lst, 2nd, 3rd, 7th and

8th on its way to capturinga fourth
consecutive Big East title. Brendan
Quinn paced the Friars,.as well as
the rest of the field, with a time of
22:52 over the 5-mile course.

Villanova placed second with 73
points, and Georgetown was third
with 93. In a small surprise, St.
John's finished fourth with 105
points, just nipping Boston Col-
lege, which had ll2 poi'nts.

Syracuse narrowly escaped with
sixth place by squeezing ahead of
Connecticut l77-l8l. Pitt placed
eighth with 252 points, and round-
ing out the field was Seton Hall
with 290.

The Panthers were led by Todd
Colas, who placed 31st; Darren
Geary was 39th; Terry Gallagher
finished 51st; and Tony Campe-
sano earned a 59th place finish.
john Hutchison completed the
Panther scoring with a 72nd place
finish. Other Pitt finishers were
Garland Brown (73rd), and Tom
Bailey (75th). ‘

Competing without a runner of
Bill Moorehead's capability was a
definite setback to the Panthers. If
Moorehead had competed, the
team might have shaven anywhere

Find  
Offense

By JIM COLLINS

The offense finally came

I-\

together last Friday night for the '

Panther Soccer team. Pit scored

nine goals—four of ‘them by Eric
Tiedtke—against an inexperienced
Robert Morris defense.

Tiedtke wasted little time, scor-
ing in the first five minutes of the
game. Nick Wilson dribbled the
ball down the right sideline and
crossed it to Tiedtke, who then vol-
leyed the ball past the helpless
goalie. Pitt was off a.nd running.

Midway. through the first half,
Pitt had a direct kick from 25 yards
out. Tiedtke kicked the ball
through a wall of defenders and the
rout was on.

Tiedtke didn’t stop after that. He _

scored the next two Panther
goals——two minutes apart. Both
goals involved Sparky Lucke, with
the two forwards working give-
and-go. Everything was right for
Pitt. They led 4-0. .
Tiedtke returned the favor to
Lucke, feeding him a give and go
for the goal. The goal came with
one minute left in the half. Goalie
Dave Torrence made one save, and
at half time, the Panthers were

, enjoying a 5-0 lead.

Pitt started the second half the
way they ended the first. Danny
Zemanski ripped a shot from 18
yards out two minutes into the
half. Colonial goalie Bill Balach
didn’t move, while Zemanski‘
dribbled by one defender and rifled
the ball into the net.

Five minutes later, John Hagen-
buch tapped inua rebound which
put the Panthers ahead 7-0.

During this time, the defense was
holding strong. Russell and team-
mates controlled the Robert Morris
offense. Panther reserve goalie
james Geraldo came on to make
one save.

Another familiar face also
returned to the lineup. Freshman
stopper Brian Casey has missed the
past three games due to a bruised
hip. Casey went through vigorous

it

rehabilitating with trainer Larry.‘

Cooper, and his hip is still a little
weak, but improving every day.

In addition to Casey, coach Leo
Bemis also inserted Nick Wilson,
who helped control the midfield
and also scored the Panthers’
eighth goal.

After working the ball upfield,
Wilson was struck at the 18 with no '
one to pass to. He calmly faked out
one defender and rocketed the ball
at the net. The goal keeper could
only get a hand on it.

With the game decided, the
Panthers continued to dominate.
Bemis substituted most of his star-
ters near the end, but it didn’t
change Pitt’s style of play. Kevin
Cox scored the final goal, neatly
tucking the ball between the goalie
and the near post, with 10 minutes
remaining.

When the final buzzer sounded,
Pitt walked away with a 9-0 win. It
was the Panthers’ finest offensive
showing of the year, but the real
test will come Monday, Oct. 25, as
the nationally-ranked Nittany
Lions roar into Pitt Stadium.
Don’t think the Panthers will sit
back.

“We'll be ready for them,” said

Tiedtke. “Robert Morris was more,‘

of a tuneup for Penn State."

A win over Penn State would
indeed make the Panther season an
enjoyable one. Nobody knows that
more than Tiedtke, who, when
asked if he would like to score four
goals against the Nittany Lions,
said, “I’d be happy with one.”

The Panther offense may have
stumbled again this weekend
against Syracuse, but the team did
emerge victorious. They didn’tj ust
“squeeze” past the Orangemen,
they administered a full shutout,
14-ZIP!

There are still skeptics, but the

.s’l"~;\,nthers will most likely retain
‘t eir No.2 spot in both the AP and
UPI polls.

Other top teams did not fare as
well as the Panthers this weekend,
as the results show:

0 It was a battle of the quarter-
backs this weekend in Morgan-
town, West Va. Over 60,000 fans
crammed into Mountaineer Field
and the surrounding hillsides to
watch Penn State’s Todd Black-
ledge and WVU’s Jeff Hostetler
battle each other.

West Virginia’s battered offen-
sive unit haphazardly made too

_ many mistakes against the Lions.
I’ “um -
g g-‘enn State came home with the

glory by blanking the Mountain-
eers 24-0.

The score, however, was not
indicative of the play. The Lions
were not insured of a win until
linebacker Scott Radecic inter-
cepted a Hostetler spiral on their 24
and raced 86 yards for a touch-
down.

i 0 No. 1 ranked Washington won
again, but not by‘ much. It was a
hard-fought battle, but the Huskies
continued to win, defeating Texas
Tech 10-3.

With only 9:39 remaining in the
game, ‘Washington's star running
,;"“.)1iCl( Jacques Robinson broke a
scoreless tie with a 19-yard touch-
down run. Although the Huskies
gained 268 yards, they managed to
score only 10 points against a team

0 The Fighting Irish of Notre

push this weekend, as they tied
Oregon, 13-13. It was a poor show-

win in six attempts. Mike john-

Irish. He kicked a tying field goal
with only 11 seconds left in the
game.

0 The Bear may have regained a
little of his pride that he lost in
Tennessee. This week, Alabama
clobbered Cincinnati 21-3. Ala-
bama quarterback Walter Lewis
ran for a game—high 156 yards in
the win.

The Tide will most likely
remain at No. 9, or possibly, move
up a notch this week.

0 The magic slipped through
the hands of Tennessee coach
Johnny Majors in a period of one
week. Tennessee suffered a 31-21
trampling to Georgia Tech. The
Volunteers’ intensity just wasn't
there on Saturday—they were
unable to contain the running
game of the Yellow Jackets. Tail-
back Robert Lavette rushed for 139
yards and three touchdowns.

O In a game that was to deter-
mine if talent really existed at
SMU, the Mustangs whipped the
Texas Longhorns 30-17. The win
was aided by a freak ricocheting
ball off the shoulder pads of a

 omeTopTeams|n Action

Texas defender into the hands of
SMU’s Bobby Leach for a 79-yard
touchdown. Southern Methodist
proved that they do have more than
the Dickerson-James Pony Express
tailback team.

If the Mustangs do not move in
the polls, their position in the No.
4 spot will be more secure after this
stellar victory.

0 One of this weekend's most
exciting matchups was in Wiscon-
sin where Illinois edged Wisconsin
23-19. With only seconds remain-
ing, Illinois’ Mike Bass kicked a
46-yard field goal. Wisconsin
slipped to 4-3 in Big Ten play as
Illinois raised its conference record
to 6-2.

0 Although Nebraska’s starting
quarterback, Turner Gill, was
injured, substitute Bruce Mathison
displayed the characteristics of a
ripened leader, leading the Corri-
huskers to a 23-19 victory over Mis-
souri. This win boosted Nebraska’s
record to 6-1 and increased their
chances of receiving a major bowl

bid.

from scarcely distinct sources:

lies coach Foge Fazio’s
defensive-minded strategies as he

While reflecting on previous low-

0 This column would like to pay

No, he did not pass away, but he
has moved up the Iadder's rungs

A weekday morning used to be
incomplete unless there was the
Musick viewpoint to mull_ over
with coffee and danish. Oh, it can
still be done, but it just is not the
same now that he does not grace the

Sure, the man had his “ene-

opinionated writing style. No mat-

not help but appreciate his innova-

the world of sports.

0 Anonymous Answer: In a
closely played and hard fought
contest, PPC narrowly defeated the
Media 12-0. The Media, comprised
of The Pitt News and WPGH,
struck first when this writer rifleda
35-yard (I think) TD strike IQ-
George Holler, only to be nullified
by an offsides infraction.

Playing before an attendance of
two at Pitt Stadium, PPC struggled
to reach the end zone against an
almost impregnable Media
defense. After all, the Media kept
PPC from scoring on two extra-
point drives.

That notwithstanding, the
Media plans to gain revenge by way
of a basketball game in the near
future. And no, Christina Clinton

is not playing.

QTVA

‘KP

By DALE MOORE

Unknown to most people, the
Pitt Panthers were in action last
Wednesday night at Pitt Stadium.
The Panthers won decisively in
one of their best offensive perfor-
mances of the season.

What you have just read is the
truth. And you missed the game. So
did just about everyone else on
camgus. The total attendance was

' less than 50. Not 50,000 people,just

plain 50. You see, the Pitt Panther
soccer team played Wednesday
night.
The Panther downed Youngs-

town State University 4-0 with an
offensive effort that would have

i done the football team proud. The

contest was watched by a crowd, if
you can call it that, composed
mostly of girlfriends, roommates
and relatives;

There are some contrasts
between the recent soccer match
and the football games on Saturday
afternoons. The first is that soccer
is played at night. Believe itor not,
Pitt Stadium is equipped with
lights. These lights are comparable
to high school lights and not good
enough to play big-time football,
but they’re sufficient for a sport
like soccer, where hand-to-eye
coordination violates the rules.

Another difference is the vantage
point from which the game can be
observed. Unlike Saturdays, there
is no scarity of good seats, and, if
the spirit strikes, you can watch
from the track and observe the
game from different angles. If you
are lucky, you can catch the ball
when someone kicks it out of
bounds.

There are a few distractions dur-
ing the game, like people jogging
around the track and an intramural
football team preparing for a

game, all of whom are oblivious to
the soccer match going on.

yers VictimsOf Non-Revenue Sports

Soccer players shouldn’t feel bad
about the lack of attention. They
share a common tie with the
runners, gymnasts, swimmers, vol-
leyball players and tennis and base-
ball players here at Pitt——they all
compete in non-revenue sports.

Revenue sports players fly to
their games, while non-revenue
players take the bus. Revenue
sports are those seen on television
every week, non-revenue sports
once a year. Pitt, it has been said,
received 1.5 million dollars for par-
ticipating in last year’s Sugar
Bowl.

That’s revenue. The university
received nothing for sending
runners to last year’s Millrose
Games in New York. That’s non- , , /’
revenue. '   x. .  /;;,I/ '

This lack of exposure no doubt 
hurt the sports, but the major lack
of interest comes from the fact that
these non-revenue sports are also

non-contact sports.

Granted, there is_ contact in the
soccer games, but the game’s inner

‘design is not geared to contact. The
majority of the non-revenue sports
can be broken into two classes—— ~
finesse and execution as in soccer,

/
volleyball and tennis, and speed
and endurance as in swimming
and running. None fall into the
class of hard hitting, physical con-
tact, which is what America loves.
No ‘solution here for this
dilemma. Threaten, beg or brib€,
people just won’t watch these

ashamed of. They played a great
game,” Fazio said. “Theyghad
exceptional coverage in their
secondary. ”

Some of the Pitt players weren’t
quite so sure of these remarks. In
fact, an innocent bystander in the
Panther locker room afterward
might have left with the impres-
sion that Pitt had lost the game.

“I was upset with the way that
we played,” said split end Julius
Dawkins. “We hurt ourselves more
than they hurt us. We made our
own mistakes. We should have
scored more.”

“Even though we did alot of
things,” added Dawkins, who
accounted, for Pitt’s first touch-
down with a catch in the corner of
the endzone, “we didn't do alot. We
were confused...switching players-
...getting subs on the field too
late.”

Dawkins said the Panthers were
more “poised” at this time last
year, saying, “We came together
our first game last year.”

Marino, who completed 24 of 38
passes for 227 yards in perhaps his
best effort of the season, saw the
statistics tainted by three more
interceptions. '

_ Two of them came on a peculiar
sequence of events in the third
quarter. Marino threw, a pass to
flanker Dwight Collins, which was

intercepted by Syracuse cornerback
Ron Hobby. After Covington
fumbled on the very next play,
Marino immediately threw
another interception, this time to
Tony Romano.

“They disguised their coverages
well,” Marino explained. “We had
the same problem today as we’ve
had all year—-we get moving down-
field, but we can't put the ball in
the endzone.”

Pitt did score again, its final
touchdown coming on the first ser-
ies of the fourth quarter. The big
play of the drive was a 20-yard com-
pletion from Marino to Syracuse
native Keith Williams. Joe McCall
capped the drive whenhe leaped
atop the pile for the insurance
touchdown.

Insurance, that is, considering
how well the defense was playing.
Surely, the chain officials could
have taken at least half the day off.
Syracuse amassed six first downs,
only one of which came in the first
half.

The Orangemen shuffled two
quarterbacks for much of the
game—Todd Norley and Greg
Christodulu—who were sacked a
total of five times for -48 yards. Syr-
acuse averaged less than two yards
a carry.

It was indeed a performance
worthy of Jekyll, at least as far as
the defense was concerned.

Fazio Upset With Criticism

razio admitted that Pitt had
committed its share of errors—-
especially penalties-——but was
quick to point out, “We’re not
superhuman; we never said we
were.”

Fazio, who takes a positive
approach to coaching, was clearly
disturbed by the media’s negative
attitude toward his team,

are welcome.

“I don't coach by saying ‘Let’s
eliminate mistakes’-—that’s nega-
tive,” Fazio said. “If you tell Danny
to cut down on his interceptions,
he might not throw the ball.’’

Fazio’s thoughts drifted back to
the outset of the season when many
media members predicted that Pitt
had too difficult a schedule to win a
national championship. Surely, a
loss to North Carolina, Florida
State, Illinois or West Virginia

hopes into tiny pieces by now.

“I once read that we would have
lost some games by now," Fazio
offered. “No one mentions that
anymore.

“Man,” Fazio added, “if some-
