  $1 million

BY KEN GORMLEY

/ The $1 million goal set for Pitt’s
 Annual Giving Fund this year
$3.. should meet the June 30 deadline,

according to Director of Develop- '

' ment and. Alumni Affairs Bernard
P. Koperek.
Donations to the Giving Fund,
solicited each ﬁscal year from Pitt
alumni and staff for use by the
University, totaled over $660,000 at
the end of April.
Koperek said he was conﬁdent
“that increased contributions ﬂow-
ing into the fund during the last
two months of the drive would
succeed in bringing the alumni
group extremely close to its mark of
$1 million.
“People generally wait until the

i . ‘deadline to make their contribu- _

”' t" ns,’.’~ he explained. “I’m pretty
sure we will hit $900,000 before the
end of'June.”

Although FAS is primarily
concerned with graduate studies,

‘Rosenberg said, “I think if we

develop experience in the graduate
ﬁeld, we could probably deal with
the undergraduate ﬁeld.”

The Council also discussed the
feasibility of an undergraduate
business major. The Master of"
Business Administration is the only
business program now offered at
Pitt. '

‘ “Right now,” Rosenberg said,

“we do not have the faculty_
‘capacity to handle a'n undergrad-

uate business major.” \ ~

alumni volunteers will be out
beating the bushes to get more
contributions.” , ‘

Money from Pitt’s Annual Giving
Fund, -collected by these volun-
teers, is channeled into the
improvement and maintenance of
the sixteen schools of the Univer-
sity, as well as into the library and
athletics.

There has been some questions’.

as to whether Pitt will enjoyfull use
of this year’s donations from the
staff and alumni, since the, State

may deduct some or all of ‘the funds -

raised by Pitt from the University’s
1975 state allocations.

However, Koperek was convinc-
ed that course would not be taken
by the ‘Governor’s Budget Ofﬁce,
and the Giving‘Fund could be used
as in the past, without depreciating
Pitt’s state funds. ‘

“I don’t believe the state would
do this,” he said, referring to’ the
‘possible subtraction of all funds

f raised from the University’s -__state.

Law Building Nears Completion

BY KEN GORMLEY

P-itt’s new Law School should be
completed in the early fall and
should be ready for occupancy by
the winter term, according to

. Director of the Physical Plant Hurnt,

V. Martin, Jr. a

Martin said he was conﬁdent the
new building, which has been
under construction for nearly two
years, will be ﬁnished in the next-

-few months. The building is on the

corner of Forbes Avenue and
Bouquet Street.

“It will probably be ready by
September,” he said. “But it
might be a little too late to take
occupancy for the fall term.”

The Physical Plant Director
e_xplained transferring the —Law
Library_ from the Cathedral into the
new ediﬁce might take consider-
able time.

The probable result, he said, is
that classes in the new Law School
‘would haveto be delayed until after
Christmas. .. . — ’ —

However, Hunt. anticipated no.
setbacks in completing the actual
construction of the campus’ newest
building by early autumn.

He estimated that, when com-
pleted, the cost of constructing the
School of Law would come close to
$8 million. I
3 This ﬁgure, Hunt claimed, was
very close to prediction made
earlier concerning the cost of
ﬁnishing the six-story building.

' Law School Dean William E. Sell
said he 7 did not feel that the
completion of the new building
would in itself improve the caliber
of legal education at Pitt.

But the Dean‘was convinced the
indirect beneﬁts of having the new
structure would be tremendous.

“Constructing a new building
never has anything to do directly
with. the quality of education,” he

Hit Goal  

and it would make no sense.”
Of the 95,000 alumni and staff

contacted by the alumni association -

in the ﬁscal year beginning July

1974 and ending in June 1975, over‘

13,000 have already made contri-
butions. Koperek expected the
number of individuals making
donations to reach 20,000 by the
end of the drive. , ‘

V Most of the checks received for
the Giving Fund, he said come
in the form of small contributions
under $100. '

However, Koperek’s figures
showed 3/4 of the actual money
taken in has been through
donations of 100 or more.

A large chunk of the Giving Fund
is provided by a Charter Council
Group, which is comprised of
approximately 80 people, each

making a gift to the Fund of over ‘

$1,000. . ~
If, as.Koperek anticipated, the $1
million ﬁgure is reached for Pitt’s

Annual Giving’ Fund this year, it p

insisted.

“But the beautiful new Law
Library will increase research
possibilities. And this could help
attract and maintain a good
faculty.”

All of these factors together, he
said, would indirectly improve the
morale of law students at Pitt and
help them perform better-

Sell expects an increase in
enrollment as soon as the new
building is open for classes, from
its present level of 525 to almost

650 students. But the quality of
legal education at Pitt, he said, —.
would not suffer from the larger..___.
number of law students. ' . _

The Dean of the Law School"_._
dismissed as unlikely the possibil-,.
ity of a tuition hike levied on those ‘
attending Law School to pay for the ~
costly new structure. . - .

“Tuition for the Law School is set
by the University,” he explained. . 
“I don’t think it willhave anyhing .0».
do with the cost of the new
buillding.” - ‘

Pitt students [apparently showed ._

a low level.of p‘olit_ic_al awareness in
a Pitt News survey conducted
Tuesday and Wednes ay.

Only 34% of -all students were
able to name any five US senators,
other than the two from ‘Pennsyl-
vania, and only.23% were able to
name the US Attorney General.

Eighty students, 47 men and 33
women, were questioned individ-
ually and at random in the
Cathedral of Learning, the Student
Union and Hillman Library. At
least‘ four of those questioned were
foreign students.

and 21% of the women were able to
name ﬁve senators.

Each interviewee was given
about a minute and a half to come
up with the‘ names, and once a
wrong name was given, the person
was disqualiﬁed. First names and
home states were not needed. 1

 ..was discussed, Rosenberg said,
 “There appeared to be opposition
:7 to increased professionalism in un-
 dergraduate programs.” He said

;‘opposition to student desire for
_t ,“greater range of curricula.”
; ‘Rosenberg cited School of
General Studies area majors, such
I _as‘Information Science and Admin-
istration of Justice, as curricula
‘ “ .-that could someday become part of
 the CAS program.
. . “One could view the School of
'General Studies as a pilot program
for other schools," he said.
 - In view of possible budget cuts of
1‘ up to 9% by the 1978-79 fiscal year,
f__\,Rosenberg exphasized the serious_-
, ness of departmental cutbacks.
 “If one phases out an entire
 ...academic department,” he said,
“‘it is important to get as large a
"consensus on the ' decision as
f possible.”
‘ A cutback in graduate programs
; would limit the number of teaching
. assistants, who are in demand
 during ‘the summer when faculty
  members are on vacation. A drop
1' in the number of TAs could disrupt
the summer program, which Pitt
pioneered.
’ . Although summer enrollment is
.low in‘comparison to past years,
A Rosenberg said, “I think the third
,_ term over-all is a cost-effective ,
. program."
.' He added that Pitt adjusts its
budget to a three-term schedule,'a
I , system that was started to gain the
 maximum economic advantage of
 the physical plant.

Flaherty Pushes
For Removal of
Senator Mazzei

The question of whether or how
State Senator Frank Mazzei can be
removed from office has become a
constitutional one.

In a suit presented earlier «this
week on behalf of two registered
voters of Mazzei’s 43rd Senatorial

District, Pittsburgh .Mayor Pete .

Flaherty asked Lt, Governor Ernest
Kline to call for a special election to
fill the senator's “vacant” seat.

The mayor contended Mazzei
was automatically expelled April
11, the day he was sentenced in
Pittsburgh for extorting $20,000
from BMI, Inc.

Kline’s attorney, Marvin Com-

isky of Philadelphia, argued the
Flaherty suit was premature
because Mazzei’s seat was -not
automatically forfeited after the
conviction.

Judge Genevieve Blatt, who
heard the case, gave both Flaherty
and Comisky 10 days to ﬁle
additional briefs to back up their
basic arguments. _

1, Blatt said a ruling would not be
forthcoming in the near future.

only "that Robert Kennedy no
longer holds the post. «-

Interviewees also were asked,
“Do you know what officer is
second in line of succession to the
presidency, that is, after the
president and the vice-president?”

Seventy-three per cent, or 58, of
the students knew that the speaker
of the house is next in line. There
was no appreciable, difference
between the answers of men and
those of women.

Of those 58, 34 knew the current.
speaker of the house is Carl Albert.

Former Speakers John McCor-
mack and Sam Rayburn, who died
14 years ago, were named
frequently. ' ‘ an

The last "question in the survey
was, “If President Ford is elected
in 1976, will he be eligible to run
again in 1980?” ~.

-Thirty-ﬁve per cent knew that
Ford would not be eligible. The
Twenty-Second Amendment prohi-
bits anyone from serving two full
terms of his own in addition to
more than half of a term to which
another person was elected.

Several interviewees who an-
swered incorrectly said although
they were aware of the constitu-
tional restriction, they did not
realize Nixon had served less than
half of his second term. "

Again, there was no signiﬁcant
difference between the -answers of
men and those of women.

Only three students answered all
five questions (including the one on
the name of the speaker of the
house) correctly.

"Student Un-Awareness

_i The ‘survey taken by the Pitt News concerning questions relevant to
American politics showed a sampling of the student body to be
relatively ignorant of leaders and processes in their own government.

feeling that those who live in a center of learning are generally more

Americans toward government and politics in the post-Watergate era.

"This adverse response was evident when barely 40% of the area’s
voters cast ballots in the state’s primary a week and a half ago.

' In their zeal to describe the “just

People,” the Palestine Solidarity
Committee (PSC) made some
"assertions in their recent Letter to

anything about Mid-East history
would immediately know are not
{‘true.

 _. Firstly, the letter states that the
establishment of a “racist, colon-

presently in Israel, they are
allowed freedom of religion, they
have a certain degree of autonomy,
and they are even represented in
So any
claims that their independence and

‘V V national character are being erased

are totally false.

Although the United Nations and
the PSC agree that the PLO is the
legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people, it is unfortun-
ate that nobody has consulted the

~ Palestinians about whom they want

to represent them. But if they start
to question their leadership, the
doubters may end up suffering the
same fate as did 26 dead school
children inrMaalot last May.

then why have they said nothing of
the 100,000 Jews that were forced
to flee Egypt, or of the persecution
of the Jewish population of Iraq, or
of the Syrian Jews who can’t leave
that country? i

This whole situation becomes
even more contradictory by the
Arab government's, use of the
“Palestinian Question” in their
negotiations with Israel. Not only
are the Arab governments re-
sponsible for the refugee problem,
but if they are truly concerned
about the fate of their Arab
brothers, then why do they allow
them to remain in squalid refugee
camps and not admit them into
their countries just as every other
country with a refugee problem
throughout history has done? The
answer must be as Emil Ghory, the
foreign Minister of Egypt, said in
1948--that the Arab governments
don’t care about the Palestinians
but only want to use them as a
political tool in their dispute with
Israel. That being the case, why
does the PSC call for the United
States to stop all aid to Israel but
not to the Arab countries which the
PSC admits are reactionary re-
gimes attempting to obliterate the
Palestinians? '

The PSC becomes even more
blatant in their distortion of the
facts _by the fifth point of their 10
point program. That is the demand
that Israel release all political
prisoners. What they mean by
political prisoners are terrorists
caught sneaking across the Israeli
border with enough explosives to
wipe a small village off the map or
the Arab guerilla who was caught
in the Savoy Hotel in Tel Aviv last
month in a “political protest”
where a good many people lost
their lives. These people are ‘not
political prisoners but are murder-
ers in every sense of the word. The
fact they think that they are
butchering for a good cause is no
consolation to anyone who was ever
killed in one of their terrorist
attacks; , .

American Ignorance of War

BY TOM WASELESKI

A feeling evoked in the highly
acclaimed Schneider-Davis pro-
duction Hearts and Minds leaves
rational Americans in the depths of
despair. What have we done to the
Vietnamese? What thrill did we
get from such annihilation? What
is it that has made this country mad
with killing and destruction, the
sadistic orgasm that comes with
bombs exploding?

We are an insane nation.

We have written off our society
to those who would manipulate our
tremendous capacity for power,
constructive. and destructive. We
have ‘submitted to the invisible
writers, who nonetheless do exist
and live in this very~'world, who
have concocted a brutal, totally
controlled civilization beyond the
wildest dreams of an ever
1984-minded George Orwell. And
their crowning achievement lies in
the successful portrayal of this
same people as the world-’s freest,
where opportunity abounds, where
brotherhood thrives--the embodi-
ment of what the rest of the world
should be.

The earth wouldn’t last a day.

We are gluttonous with power
and wealth. All this money--capit-
al, if you will--and nowhere to use
it. Instead of buying our way out of

Budget Figures
Are for Students

Pitt is indeed an educational
institution! The front page story in
the May 20 Pitt News proves it
again. Jack Freeman lectured to a
group of students concerned about
decision-making on the University
budget, and taught a number of
important lessons:

First, that budget “information
would be useless to students.”
Does this mean that the informa-
tion itself is useless or that
students are incapable of under-
standing it? (The latter position
had been taken earlier by the
Chancellor’s staff). If the
information is useless, we have an
If
students are considered too dumb,
we have an administration whose
contempt for students, demonstra-
ted in many other ways, has finally
been openly stated. '

Second, that changes in the
University budget are -“not a
decision to be made in a democratic
way.” Once" again, an attitude
which has been widely demonstra-
ted has ﬁnally been explicitly
stated. In this university,
described this winter as being
governed in a “friendly collegiate”
fashion, the administration will
decide what’s best for the rest of
us.
Third, “to get‘ into a broad
discussion of the specifics would be
futile.” So much for a couple of
centuries of the democratic tradi-
tion of open discussion and
majority rule. The experts in the
administration are bravely willing
to take the responsibility of making
unpopular decisions (does this
smell a bit of Richard Nixon's
rhetoric?) even though determining
cutbacks is “a highly personal
decision, depending on where you
sit...”

Of course Jack Freeman has a
right to teach his lesson. I think it
is important for Pitt News readers
to realize that many of us disagree
sharply with the Freeman position.

It is not useless for students to
have information. It is one of the
central purposes of a university to
encourage students to insist on
information relevant to the lives

based, unthinking excuse for a

~ culture and spread it throughout

the world. -

In the ﬁlm, General William
Westmoreland says “Life in the
Orient is cheap.” If this is so,
there is no such thing as life in the
Occident. In Eastern peasant
society most people grow their own
fook, family life remains intact, the
aged are not carted off when they
are “useless.” There is respect. for
an unseen force superior to man,
there are no astronomical suicide
rates, there is no preoccupation
with the so-called crucial questions
of: When does life begin?, Does
one have the right to end one’s own
life?, and so on. Life exists, it is
abundant, it is everything, and the
people revere it. '

Our central crime lies in the
belief that anything not in line with
American life is backward, stupid
and, God forbid, wrong. This
self-righteousness is the tragic
result of our isolation--yes, isola-
tion--in a world beset by agony and
pestilence. Despite our military
and capitalistic presence on_ every
continent in the world, we have
never experienced wholesale land
invasions, the horror of bombs
falling on one’s home,‘ the
helplessness and tremendous fru-
stration of seeing one’s child burn

complicated and obscure form (as it

' well may be), it is the duty of the

administration to clarify it.

The University budget decisions
should not be made by a small
group with power, and discussions
of the present budget and the
needs of students and teachers are
not futile, but would be of great
educational value and almost
certainly indicate better solutions.
Of course, the process would be
unpleasant and unpopular, espec-
ially for those interests who do well
in the absence of discussion, but

that’s the nature of responsible

self-government--a key element of
liberal arts values.

I hope the Pitt News will take an
active part in broadening the
educational scope of the debate
about priorities at Pitt--it would be
a vital contribution.

I just read Denise Gower’s article

During my campaign for Student

the security system to many people

suggested many of the changes in
the system that you yourself have‘.
Putting a policeman at the door
along with the security guard’ to
keep people from running in, and
having the guards do the job they
as some are
incapable or don’t care, were a few
suggestions I made.

On May 1, I wrote a letter to the
Housing Directors of UC_LA,
Temple University, Penn State and
Boston University on the security
systems they have at these schools.

a gross injustice to both the
students and professors’ involved.

I I realize the various critical

However, I feel that_students know-

well or possibly better than the

observe their professors .at least
biweekly while the administration’s

direct contact "with a particular 

professor‘ is considerably less
frequent. Therefore, I strongly feel
that students should have-a voice in
the process of the formulation of
the tenure decision.

I recommend that the University
of Pittsburgh adopt a weighted
percentage of influence regarding
student evaluations of professors
and the administration’s decision
of granting tenure to professors.

elements. You have to take their
ideas and help shape them visually
to make them more exciting.”

Brunger enjoys teaching, but his
interest in art is all-pervasive and
he takes pains with each detail of
the work. .

“When I entered ‘Bridge’ in the
Westmoreland Show it was not
painted. I added that to avoid the
oxidation problem you encounter
with aluminum. I prefer the rich,
quality of the metal itself. I guess
I’m kind of a purist about art.

‘ “As far as the Pittsburgh market
is concerned, I’m considered too
expensive,” continued Brunger.
“What I’m concerned with is not
popular acclaim in Western Penn-
sylvania, but the integrity of art,
with the image itself.”

Although critical acclaim —is
important to Brunger here, his
orientation is toward the New York
scene. But, he admits that meeting
the societally imposed pressures,of
being a responsible citizen already
have kept him in Pittsburgh longer
than he expected, and that
prospects for leaving the area are
hazy. .
That may well be Pittsburgh’s
gain. ’

stage. That’s why I’m spending so
much time focusing the equipment.

“The back stage lights are pink
filters, which will light the actors
and make them look as though they
are giving off heat, with the colder
blue and white front lights trapping
them or restraining them.”

Knowles said that the effect of
light if well done, is below the
conscious level; although the
impact adds immeasurably to the
total production.

“Think of when you were a kid
and you put a ﬂashlight under your
chin...and well, you looked evil.

Light coming up from below is evil,
where the halo, or what we call the
god light,

“Now_ when you react to this
lighting, you never even think in
terms of light, but just what your
reaction is to seeing it.”

With some 26 hours left before ‘
the opening of the play, stage’

designer Henry Heyman appeared,
armed with a can of paint and
brush, to make the final-changes to
the physical props.

“We wanted to avoid a soap‘
‘ opera look,” Heyman said, “and to

avoid dating the play. It was a very
realistic play at the time, but We’re

are money bags. Great.

The Festival fits right in with
Pittsburgh history. “Free to the
People.” Andrew Carnegie would
have approved. Although the City
pays for some of the performing
arts exhibited here, most of the
money comes from a year-around
fund-raising drive that depends
mostly on mailing lists, according
to Rhonda Brown, a staff member
of the Festival office in Carnegie
Institute. ,

“For instance before we had the
sky-light, the stage just looked like
a collection of furniture, like a
warehouse. But with the sky-light
suspended over the stage, the set is
contained. ’ ’ ‘

According to Heyman,

central conception of the Look Bafé - '

in Anger set is that of an arena.
“It’s not a machine for theatrics.
The stage for Pantaglieze was
basically just a machine for acting,
which was a twenties idea.’ This
stage is a setting, and an arena for
the characters. We’re doing it
more in Ca ‘ Pinter style than the
original’ Osborne production.”
With some 22 hours remaining

assassin, reaches out to the woman
he has tortured. ‘

His‘friend’s mother is dying and
now he begs Allison, his woman, to
go with him and face the spectacle
of mortality. And she leaves the
room.

_ ‘ All the detail, all the planning is

invisible now. All the sweat and
careful effort is lost in the vision of
the play as Jimmy Porter,- alone
with his bitterness and anger, sobs
while the stage fades into absolute
blackness.

'I'ri's Orchestration Bows Strings

The other half of the show was

.Evonne Goolagong, who decisively

defeated player-coach Rosie Casals
6-1 in their ﬁrst singles match this-
season.

The Tri’s now are 6-4 and are in

second place in the Eastern ~

Division of World Team Tennis,
behind Billie Jean King and the
New York Sets. Last night’s was
the String’s fourth straight loss.

Last week, they led the Western
Division. ‘

Goolagong and Peggy Michel
had a 7-6 tiebreaker victory over
Kathy Harter and Bettyann Stuart,
who substituted" for Casals.
Goolagong was dynamic with her
serves, returns and numerous
spikes. Michel and Harter also

_ improved over last time. . Harter
played more quickly than last time,

when she was reluctant to chase
balls.

’ Women’s singles went smoothly
for Goolagong, as she defeated
Casals without mercy. The -only

game Casals won was the fourth,

The Strings ﬁrst set win came in
men’s doubles when Ross Case and
Geoff Masters beat Cox and Kim
Warrick 6-4. Cox was outstanding.
He won the three games he served
and exhibited a lot of speed and
ﬂexibility, charging the net and
spiking the ball. ‘

Cox continued his excellent play
during the men’s singles when he
beat Lutz 6-2. ' Lutz didn’t seem to
have ..the quick maneuverability he
displayed last week. i

Had Lutz won the singles, ‘he

would have stirred some interest in 

the final set, mixed doubles. But
because he lost, the Tri’s won.
They would have done so even if
they had lost all the games in the
ﬁnal set.

The mixed doubles marked the
Strings’ second win, 7-5, as Casals
and Masters defeated Gerulaitis
and Rayni Fox. During the set,
Masters had a lot of spikes plus
some fast and rather long volleys
with Fox. "Casals ‘played more

‘” slowly than in her earlier sets. Fox‘

was almost as good as Masters.
She was quick at the net, but her
serves were a bit off.
