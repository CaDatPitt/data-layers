A list of ,.guidelines, governing ,

with students representing various

The list outlines the procedures

event and their resident assistant no

The guidelines also state that a _

resident host must be .on hand at all
times during the party to sign in and
escort guests and make sure that

no guests leave the party carrying ’

The list makes all individuals

Student Board Reaches Stalemate
Over ‘Stand on Stock Divestiture   

By MARGI STUMPF
‘ Pitt News Staff Writer

The Student Government Board
reached a stalemate Wednesday on
the question of University invest-
ment in multinational corporations
with holdings in South Africa.

‘The subject of indirect University
ﬁnancial support (via Pittsburgh

banks) in those corporations has

been tossed about by SGB since
Sept. 22. SGB at that time voted to
support total liquidation of Univers-
ity stocks in corporations operating
in_ South Africa.. -

On Oct. 18 the SGB began to
reconsider its position on divesti-
ture and began to discuss the
possibility of supporting the
Sullivan Principles, which state
guidelines for change in work and
social conditions of South African
blacks. The principles are
supported by the University's
Board of Trustees. ‘

SGB member Bernie Popko
presented- a position paper at

,Wednesday’s meeting supporting

continued University investment
and calling for active application of

1

drinking, weekend quiet hours and.
ﬁre and safety regulations, all of
which are serious ‘ enough . for
judicial board a‘c'tion.“”‘ V ‘p  

The guidelines listed are not new
to the residence halls but have not
been strictly enforced until this
year.

“There really isn’t any ‘sudden
concern over ‘this, but it is
something that we have always
been concerned with,” Wassum
said. ‘-‘This year we are being a
little more vocal and putting the
responsibility with students where-

,it belongs, while trying to raise the,

general awareness of everyone
involved.’’ . _
Wassum said that he can note no

the Sullivan ' Principles by the
corporations in which the University
owns stocks. .

“It is much more appropriate for
shareholders to utilize their position
in trying to persuade management
to abandon unethical practices,
rather than simply adopting a
cut-and-run approach though dis-
association,” Popko read from the
paper he prepared.

Popko said it is unrealistic to
divest only in South Africa since “a
vast majority of the nations of this

world are either purely totalitarian .

or at least minimally undemocra-
tic, ” and multinational corporations
are involved also in many of those
nations.

Popko added that divestiture may
be detrimental. to South African
blacks. According to Popko, stocks
sold by the University could be
picked up by parties even more
disinterested in black humani-
tarianism, or not "bought at all,
which would lead to “economic
dislocation” in South Africa.

A _Refuting Popko’s position was
member Jan Medoff. Reading from

Thornburgh Fields Queries on Race

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Richard L. Thornburgh met the
press for the first time as
governor-elect Wednesday mom-
ing in the William Penn Hotel and
discussed his upset victory over
Democrat Pete Flaherty and plans
for the transition period before he
becomes governor in January.

“Pete ran "a good campaign,”

. saidThornburg_h, whowas accom-

panied by his family, Lt. Governor.-
elect William Scranton III and U.S.
Sen. H. John Heinz III (R-Fox
‘He was very gracious
in his concession speech. There is a
little bit of heat generated in any
political campaign.but never was
there any personal animosity

' between Pete and me.”

Thornburgh said unusual support
from traditional Democratic strong‘-
holds in the Lehigh Valley and
Philadelphia were the key to his
victory.

“In short, there were all kinds of
Pennsylvanian’s who broke out of
stereotypes of the past and gave us
a vote of conﬁdence,” Thornburgh
said.

Thornburgh Offers Hope for Pitt's Budg

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer
7 With Richard L. Thornburgh’s
election as governor of Pennsyl-
vania, administrators and- student
government members hope that the
change in administration will mean
more money for Pitt and other
state-related universities.

Thomas Lamb, director ' of
commonwealth relations, said that
Thornburgh has shown interest in
the plight of higher education in

Pennsylvania andrexpected him to

try to help Pitt with more funds.
“Thornburgh, the governor-

elect, has indicated several -times.

that the new -figures on higher
education that showed Pennsyl-
vania 50th for increases in funds for
higher education are very disturb

' ing and said something should be

done about it.“ Lamb said.

Since Thornburgh is aware of the
problem and has expressed an
interest in it, Lamb said he believed
the governor elect could be
expected to be receptive to requests
for aid to Pitt.’

When he was asked how

Thornburgh could aid state-related‘

universities when his running mate
William Scranton III has already
said that Thornburgh’s . first
priorities are solving the financial
problems of the “Pennsylv:‘ni:*
Department of Transportation and
the state pension system, Lamb said
the governor-elect would not be
able to help the
immediately.

“When talking about the inten- I

tions of Thornburgh, I don’t mean
he is going to do something right
away,” Lamb said. “Programs of
higher education or whatever will
have to wait until administrative
tasks are fulfilled.”

Student Government Board _
member Dave Hesidence said that
higher education was one of the
issues Thornburgh stressed in~his
campaign. He pointed out that the

Thornburgh said the foundation
for his victory plan was laid out early
in the summer months. (

“Nobody turns an election
around overnight,” he said.
“There was a plan worked out at the
very beginning of this campaign
and even though the dark days,
when we were down some 32 points,
it was a plan we did not abandon. It
was a plan to appeal to all
Pennsyvlanians and to concentrate
on the East, where I was not
well-known. ’ ’

Thornburgh said he has not yet
considered specific candidates to fill
cabinet posts, and added, “We are
going to take our time and do the
kind of deliberate choosing of the
leaders of this state. We are not
going to have a Sam Begler (Gov.
Shapp’s patronage secretary) in this

' administration. ’ ’

Thornburgh said he would look
throughout the state to find people
to serve in government. “Give
some time to this state, which is in
serious trouble now and requires
the very best in the way of talent.
That talent is there,’ ’ the governor-
elect said.

related universities a preferred item
on the budget. .

“Thornburgh set three
priorities--repair of roads, cor-
rpuption, and‘ education,” Hesi-
dence said. ‘ ‘He stated his position
only a few weeks before the election
and supported it with a program.”

Todd Park, chairman of the
Public and Government Relations
Committee of the SGB, said
Thornburgh would be good for
higher education, but added
reservations to his praise for the
governor-elect. '

‘‘.In comparison to Pete Flaherty,

Thornburgh also discussed the
death penalty and the appointment
of judges by a merit system.

“I think the death penalty
provisions passed by the General
Assembly over the govemor’s veto
‘are constitutional provisions,” he
said. “I do think we need a death
penalty in Pennsylvania to deter
some kinds of homicides, and I
would not hesitate to see it‘

' enforced. ’ ’

The General Assembly is
currently debating changing the
constitution to abolish the election
of judges, replacing elections with
an appointment process. ' ‘

‘ ‘lthink that is one change we will
support,” Thornburgh said. “I
supported that concept 15 years
ago. I think we ought to take our

courts out of politics as much as we.

can.

Scranton said he was looking
forward to a . “busy time in
Harrisburg” and a “good working
relationship” with Thornburgh.

‘ ‘I certainly don’t intend to let any
moss grow,” Scranton said.

we should be doing go'od with
Thornburgh,” Park said. “We
expect Thornburgh to give more

than Flaherty, but not as much as

we would like. Thornburgh is the
better of the two alternatives, but he
is not as good as we would like.”

» The change in the composition of
the state House of Representatives
was also discussed by Lamb, Park,
and Bob Daley of College Young
Democrats during interviews. The
balance in the house before the
election was 116 Democrats to 84
Republicans, but Republican gainst

because of a tied election.

Lamb said the ‘change from aji

predominantly Democratic House
to a split, House would have little
effect on the attitude of the house on
funding for state related univer-
sities. ' , — -

“I don’t think that whatever party
controls makes too much difference
in the attitude to higher education, ’ ’
Lamb said_. “Over the years, the
legislature, Democratic or Repub-

, Resident Students Voice Anger

Over New Housing Lottery System,

(Continued from page 1)

During the room assignment
last year, announcements on the
assignment were sent February
15. By February 16 at3 p.m., the
2,300 available spaces in the
dormitories had been filled by

students who had already paid
the $100 deposit required for a
room at the Office of Student
Accounts.

“It was pretty much agreed
that the old procedure was a bad
procedure by the three groups, ’ ’
Fonseca said.

He added that the three
groups had consulted other
schools to ﬁnd a new process.

‘After consideration during the
spring and summer the Ofﬁce of

‘Residence Life, the Housing .
Office and the RSA submitted
the new process to the vice
chancellor of student affairs,
and it was approved, according
to Fonseca.

Despite the problems with the
old system, ‘students insisted
that they still preferred. the old
system to a lottery system. “I ,
would rather stand in line and
know I am going to get a room,
than not know I’m going to get a
room by chance,” Bob Fields,
another Towers resident said.
“I don’t like it by chance,”

Fonseca said that there was a
problem because the new 1
system had already been
approved at the upper level of

the administration so there was
no guarantee that there would
be any change in the process
now. \ .

"‘Input at this point is kind of

futile since the process has been

The

decided upon already,” Fon-
seca said. /

Fonseca added that he and
Don Hughes, director of the
Housing Office would convey
the students’ feelings to their
superiors and see if there could
be some attempt to hold some.
vote on the new process.

“As we said at the meeting
this afternoon, Don and I would
do some checking with our
superiors to have this kind of
change at this point,” Fonseca
said. “We hear loud and clear
what you’re saying and w
understand. ’ ’ 1

Students complained that
there had been np publicity
about the new proc-~.. ‘e.

. “People still don’t know about
the lottery,” Bill Sunner, a
Tower C Resident said. ‘ ‘I must

. have talked to 100 people today-

and they didn't know about it.”

After the meeting,‘ Hughes
said his office had thought the
students had been informed

about the new "application 5

process.
“Both Fred’s -office and my
ofﬁce worked with student-
groups from last year on this,”
he said. “We thought the
groundwork had been laid, but
“we have been hearing it hasn’t
been.”
‘ ‘Most of the students said they
favored a vote to decide between
the old system and the new
system._ Steve Fendler, chair- -
man of the SGB Judicial Board,’
said he could ' organize an
election to be held through the
.SGB Election Committee at any
tim '

Weekend  

“The SGB election committee
can hold a special election,”
Fendler said. “I can have them
ready to hold an election at any
time.” ‘

Fonseca said he would know
by tomorrow whether an
election could be held and said
he could make no promises
besides that. “The only thing I
can tell you is I should know by

tomorrow,” he said.

The tentative plan outlined by
the draft on the lottery system
would draw numbers to see if
they received a dormitory room
next year. Ten percent of.
available spaces would be .
allotted for seniors. Another 20
percent would be allotted‘ to
juniors and 30 percent would be

' allotted to sophomores.

Students in these groups who
did not draw a number low
enough to receive a room
assignment would then be
placed on a waiting list. After
the lottery for the room
assignments, those who had
qualiﬁed for rooms under the
lottery would then be required to
pay a deposit- by February.

Under the new room assign-
ment system, some room spaces _
I — would be automatically reserved
for’ freshmen and other select
students. Accordingto Fonseca
and Hughes, athletes, chan-

John Fitzsimmins, a resident assistant, stressed the
last argument at a meeting last night. ‘flt seems you
are dealing with a lot of statistics and not with
‘people. Do you think if you throw 30 or 40 people
onto this floor randomly by lott
sense of community here now?

“If you want this structure kept in the shape it is in
now, you have to have the same people there (on
floors) ever year. If you go to a lottery system, you
won’t have this.” Fitzsimmins pointed to the newly

claimed that applications didn’t arrive until it was
too late. As a result, some students were shut out of
the‘ assignment process.
Faced with an unpopular and ineffective system,
the University Housing Office,
Residence Life and the Resident Student Association
joined forces to find an alternativeto the continuing
. housing problem. The result was a lottery system, in
which Pitt dorm residents pull numbers to discover if
they win the chance to live on campus next year.
Students have already voiced their opposition to
the new plan. Aletter signed by concerned residents
of Tower C expressed dissatisfaction with the new
lottery. They cited discrimination to upperclassmen
(as it stands in the first draft, the new system opens
only 10 percent of available space to seniors and only
20 percent to juniors) as one major complaint against
Tower "C residents also
 criticized the randomness of the system ‘and the loss
of community that would occur on close-knit floors

fliers about it were sent to some students in the last
few days. Some students are not aware of the new

One idea proposed to gauge student opinion on
the application process is a vote by dormitory
residents to see if dorm residents favor the old system
or the new lottery system. The referendum on the
application process can be held immediately, accor-
ding to Steve Fendler, head of the SGB Judicial
“I can have them (the SGB Election

Committee) ready to have an election at any time,”
Fendler said last night.

' The only factor that blocks an election is that the
process has already been approved by the vice chan-
cellor for student affairs and other senior ad-
ministrators. In their eyes, the process is already
policy.- Fred Fonseca, director of the Office of
Resident Life said they must be consulted before any '

We urgethe administrative officials to allow an

have not been permitted to give an opinion on this

matter, and it is essential that dormitory residents be

closely affects their lives at Pitt. .

painted lounge as proof that a’ sense of community
can help keep the dorms in good shape.

Whether or not these objections are justified is not
the important point. The crux of the problem is that
the consumers of the product offered by the Uniyer-'
sity—the residents.—are not satisfied with the method
used to determine whether they will live in a dor-
mitory next year.

Their dissatisfaction with the new system seems
valid enough, especially since very few of the stu-
dents knew about the new application process before

presidents. I've shot pictures with a

. 20-year-old Polaroid, and I've ,
wasted rolls of ﬁlm while learning to’

use a new Canon camera. I've ﬂown
in a helicopter with a governor, I’ve
sweated while talking to a prisoner
in jail, and I've sat through
hundreds of hours of city council
and other government meetings.
There have been hundreds of my
own questions, thousands of pages
of notes to transcribe, and hours of
cassette tapes to listen to. i 1
Finally I was on the other side. I
had never really thought about what
it would be like. It was I being asked
the questions and being photo-
graphed. It was a new experience.
A young cub reporter from my
hometown paper called to do a story

about my new job, so the "paper
wanted to do a story. Afterall, I had
worked for that paper for several
years, and they wanted to report on
how one of their own is doing.
The young man asked: “How are
you doing?” How am I doing?
Remember, my folks and friends
. would be reading the story-500
miles away. Ihad to let them know I
am ﬁne and surviving in the big city.

Unfortunately I can’t even’

remember the reporter’s name. I
was surprised by the phone call.

Why would anyone want to do a
story‘ on me? I became nervous. I
began to think about all the good
copy I could give him. He was
asking a question and I wasn’t
even thinking. What did you’ say?

“How do you like it there? Are
the people different? Do they miss
Johnny Majors?” he asked.

I had to give good answers.
Perhaps someone from Pittsburgh
would get a copy of the story, so I
had towatch what I said and not say
something that would make them
mad in Pittsburgh. I wanted to be
good copy for the youngster (I,
calling him a youngster, as though I
had‘ become a Carl Bernstein or
someone). I wanted to be humorous
like Bob Hope and as interesting as
Robert Redford. I didn’t want to be
dull like Howard Cosell or as
evasive as Richard Nixon.

Then I went blank. He wanted to
know how long I had been in
Pittsburgh and I couldn’t remem-
ber. From where did I'receive my
degrees and when? I wasn’t sure I
had gone to college. I was going
into shock and had to recollect. This
wasn’t the ‘way things were
-supposed to be.

“What were some of your
activities whenyou lived in Oak
Ridge?”. he asked. Iwasn’t sure. I
had delivered papers. I was an
_ usher at a theater. I once had a part
in a play. What boring copy, I
thought. What happened to all the
good things I "had done in Oak

_,=’_.:

Ridge? They just wouldn't come
back to me now.

“What are some of the highlights
of your career? ’ ’ he was persisting.
Well let's see. I shot several
pictures of a tragic fire one time and
forgot to put film in the camera. I
went out for an interview and forgot
to get the address of where I was
going. My plane didn’t show up in
St. Louis once and I had to spend the
night in the airport. .

Ridiculous answers! Why
couldn’t I give him good things to
write? This was my hometown
paper, and I was making a fool of
myself. Where was all the good
copy? ' V

~ Do you have any friends with birthdays or anniversaries coming up
soon? Looking for a special gift for a special person? Why not send ‘a

singing telegram?

That’s right—-—a singing telegram. Maybe you’ve seen one delivered
in some corny black andwhite movie on late night television and
wished you could sendone ‘yourself. _You can. '

Patty Broderick, a graduate student in communications at Pitt and
her ﬁance, Frank Cappelli, run Horsefeathers andthey are in the
business of sending singing telegrams. O

Horsefeathers delivers singing telegrams anywhere in the greater
Pittsburgh area. They don’t have to be sent to a person’s‘home. Many
people have had telegrams‘ sent to ofﬁces, wedding receptions ‘and’

restaurants .

These telegrams are unique because. Horsefeathers ‘takes personal‘
information supplied by the sender and ‘incorporates it into an original‘
song that will be sung to the melody of a popular tune. » Broderick and '
Cappelli write the songs. They suggest including ‘the recipient’s‘
hobbies, likes and dislikes, a nickname or the occasion on which they’ll
be receiving the singing telegram.

Cappelli, “Mr. Gitto,” will arrive at the speciﬁed location dressed in
a modiﬁed Pitt Band uniform and announce that he has a telegram for
the person. Then he’ll take off his cap, in which he has the telegram
concealed, and proceed to belt out the tune in his strong operatic tenor

voice .

“It’s' a great way to _surprise someone,’
sings at the Wooden Keg and the Raspberry Rhinoceros. Perhaps even

a bit embarassing.

Public 'S'Of Mice and Men’ Good Performance

Directed by Ben Shaktman
Pittsburgh Public Theater

John Steinbeck’s novel,‘ ‘ ‘Of Mice ,

and Men, ” came to life last night at
the Pittsburgh Public Theatre in‘a
well-directed and beautifully acted
production.

Set in an agricultural California
valley in 1937, the play revolves
around George and Lennie, two
ranch hands. George (David Little)
is a dreamer and looks to the time
when he and Lennie can own their
own ranch. ,

Lennie (Nicholas Wyman) shares
in this dream too; he -looks forward

 

  Phillips’ 'Trancendan

to tending the rabbits on the ranch.
He is a huge, powerful man who IS

~- mentally retarded-. Attracted to soft

objects, he accidentally kills the
things he loves because he doesn’t
know his own strength. "

The two start work at a new.ranch 
after they escape from their last job,

at which Lenniewas accused of
molestingaa girl whose red dress
attracted him. ‘

George keeps close watch on -
Lennie to make sure he keeps out of ‘

trouble. George finds time to
fantasize about the future, and
Candy, a handicapped ranch hand,
and Crooks, a blackstable hand,
soon share in his dream.

George is especially wary of

softness", he clutches ‘her hair and‘

breaks her neck.

George gets to, Lennie ﬁrst and
shoots him so his friend would be

his portrayal of the man with the

With a title like “Trancendance” '

expect the album to be an emotional
uplifter. To a degree you would be
right, but, on a whole, this effort by
Shawn Phillips is disappointing.

Wyman is convincing as Lennie.

AZOHosting
Celebration at
Pitt This Weekend

ByRANDYNOVAK

The Pittsburgh chapter of Alpha
Zeta Omega, the national phar-
maceuticalfraternity, will host th_e
Fall Regional Convention on Nov..
10-12 at the Hilton Hotel.

The weekend of activities will
include tours of the Pitt campus and
attendance at the Pitt-West Virginia

. football game. The highlight will be

a celebration of the convention’s
50th anniversary at the traditional
Saturday night dinner dance.

The Pitt Chapter has _many
unique characteristics: It is a mixed
chapter, whose members include
both graduates and under-
graduates. Previously an all-male
fraternity, it is now coed with an
equal female-to-male ratio. ‘The
switch came in 1975 after the
reorganization of the chapter’s
Dwindling interest
forced the chapter to go inactive in

3 the early _.1970s. Through the efforts

of leader Bill Liepack and others,
the chapter was revitalized in 1975

. and accepted -female members for

the first time. Since then
membership has been increasing
steadily. ‘

The fraternity’s most important
feature, however, is that it’s a
professional_fraternity. Most of its
efforts are directed toward the
improvement of pharmacy by
working with other professional
organizations, as well as providing
pharmacists with professional ser-
vices, such as continuing education
programs.

Because of recent restructuring,

the fraternity hasn't been involved
in many other activities. Future
plans include participation in
projects such as hypertension
screenings and smoking awareness
clinics aimed at increasing the
public’s awareness of pertinent
health-related issues.

Poor Punk Rock Taste C°°ksDucks'Goose 2.

By  R. SELL

Don’t Mind Rockin’ Tonight
Ducks Deluxe
RCA Records

prove that garbage can be recycled.

Ducks Deluxe’s third album,
“Don’t Mind Rockin’ Tonight,”
makes one point perfectly clear: If
punk is going to make any kind of
comeback, it should take an
alternate route.

Supposedly a greatest hits
collection of two previous albums,
“Don’t Mind Rockin’ Tonight”
takes bad taste and adds new
dimensions to it. - I

“Coast to Coast,” the only single
Ducks Deluxe released, begins the

album. It tells of a young guitarist
who travels to California and
becomes a rock star. Soundbad?

Just add Sean Tyler’s three-chord
guitar, the raspy vocals of ~Mich
Garvey, a primitive drum beat and

description. .

Nothing more really should be 
said about Ducks Deluxe, but if you ' i
really want to look into them any T
further, check out the shelves at the I;  A
Record Graveyard. You may ﬁnd an, A

old copy. ‘

For the past few years America what you get is a sound that defies

has been plagued with a new form of , e .
social disease called punk rock.   -

When the Sex Pistols started:
having more downs than ups and
guitarist Sid Vicious overdosed after
a concert in Los Angeles and later
stabbed his girlfriend, it seemed
punk was finally on its way out.

,.-.a-,. But now, from the seemingly
endless resources of rock’n’ro1l,

Broadway 5 WIZ
(Continued from page 7)

Perhaps what makes it better
than many other albums is the
story and symbolism behind the
lyrics. Although it tells the obvious 7
story of Dorothy and her travels to ‘
meet The Wiz in the Emerald City,
ther is much more holding up “The
Wiz.”

"i“~The lyrics relate, to almost
everyone and his life. From the
impressive “What Would I Do If I
Could Feel?” and Believe in _
Yourself” to the symbolic “Home”
there is a deep meaning.

Dominating the entire theme is
that “Home” is the love within .
yourself. As Home teaches, “Home
is a place we all have to find. Home
is knowing your mind. Knowing
your heart. Knowing your heart.
Knowing your_ courage. If we know
ourselves, we’re always home,
anywhere.” . The album has ‘a
powerful message and impact to

, relay. r

53”‘ All in all, the complete sleek
package is a bundle of musical,
talented and meaningful ingenious-
ness. I

made the save, but the defenseman
who was sliding across the crease,
knocked the puck into the net. The
Panthers scored their second goal
two minutes A later when Mark
Lewendowski took a pass from Bill

the puck low to the glove-hand side.

when he took a goalmouth pass from

defensemen Rick Stein at 11:31 of
the second period.

Pitt was in command of most of
the game and scored two more
times in the third period. The first
goal came only 16 seconds into the

   Rumors, Record Keep Cignetti s lob up in the Air

By non LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer
Despite what the signs and

, posters claim, West Virginia never

has been “almost heaven’? to

;Mountai_neer coach Frank Cignetti.

If tomorrow’s , game between West
Virginia‘ and ‘20th-ranked Pitt fails

- to produce any major Mountaineer

miracles, it just might become

1 = ; downright hell.

When ‘two traditional’ rivals

meet, the cliche most. often ﬂung
“You can throw thet
a records out for this one.”

Given
half the chance, there likely would
be no objections from either Jackie
Sherrill or Cignetti.

Even though there is a vast

3 difference between the two records

(WVU stands at 2-7, while Pitt is
6-2), as well as among the talent on
the ﬁeld, only‘ two things certainly‘
will happen when the teams square
off on the Pitt Stadium rug: Kickoff
will-be at 1:30 p.m., and,‘ at some

,' time during’ the game, a rabid
_ Panther fan will get into a heated

discussion with one or more of the
Mountaineer faithful.

In most cases, that kind 7 of-
’ emotion also is felt by the players.

“In all my years of coaching,‘ I've
never been ‘around’ a. more
emotionally high squad than our’s
before last year’s game in

, Morgantown,"’ said Sherrill.

“Early in the game, we were called
for a lot of penalties because. our
players were being ' very’ aggres-
sive. That’s one sign ‘of an
emotional" oup of players:” '

1 lack of emotion tomorrow.

With all the young players on
both squads, there should be no

freshman, ‘is the Mountaineers’
leading rusher with 383 yards, but

may be’ slowed tomorrow by an ‘
injured ankle. « Robert Alexander .-

has been used as a play messenger
and ‘has 284 yards on the. season.

When Hoffman decides to ‘put
the ball. in the air, it usually is
thrown in the general direction of
Steve Lewis, who leads the ‘team
with 29- receptions; Hoffman

averages nearly 130 yards throwing ' '

a game, but has thrown T14
interceptions.‘ . _

“He’s not a great runner or a
great thrower,” Cignetti said about

t Hoffman. “He’s got to 1earn\‘.not‘to.
He tries, to-force ‘
things sometimes‘ to make a big‘

beat himself.

play.” ., ,

The .big play man ‘for the
Mountaineer defense, Jeff Macer-
elli, will be watchingﬂfrom the
sidelines tomorrow. Macerelli, the
team’s leading tackler, sustained
knee ligament damage in the Penn
State game and ‘is lost for the rest
of the season. West Virginia‘ will
be bolstered by the return ‘of
middle guard Joe Jelic, who has
missed much of the season with
shoulder and ‘leg injuries.

As well as the injuries, the youth

With a tough schedule. Or as Cignetti evaluated it

,,../-——

these days wondering where he’ll be traveling next
season. His Mountaineers are 2-7; 1978 is already
down. the drain.
Morgantown are any indication, Cignetti’s job soon
may follow.

students began to surfacelast year, when the Moun-
. ties stumbled through, their second straight 5-6
season. The fans merely attended home games,
obediently sat on their hands and anxiously awaited
the halftime show. Thealumni with their grumbling,
sparked rumors of Cignetti’s job security. And the

students" were least subtle, phoning athletic director

Leland Byrd's home at least once to present a verbal
pink slip. '
... This year, thought Cignetti, would be different.

 His preseason optimism whetted the fading hopes of

the Mountaineer faithful and touched even the most
wary on University Avenue. Said the third-year
coach during fall c,amp,"‘This will _be the best foot-
ball team I’ve coached since being the head coach at
West Virginia University. ” ’

The Mountaineers, however, ran into troubles, the
most debilitating of which were an impossible
schedule, inconsistency, an impossible schedule, the
« lack of the big play, an impossible schedule, the ab-
sence of depth and an impossible schedule.

The bottom line,,w_hich probably willserve as a

noose around Cignetti’s neck: a 2-7 record going in-

to tomorrow’s game at Pitt Stadium. The wins, sadly
enough, were the bookends of aseven-game losing
streak, a dubious Mountaineer record.

Subsequently, the mood in Morgantown is un-
changed. The fans, though spinning the turnstiles in
record numbers, still are sitting on their hands; the
alumni, after another graduating class, still are
grumbling; and the students, as blatant: as ever, still
are sending messages to Byrd. Recently hanging
from the bridge outside Mountaineer Field was a
bedsheet banner telling the AD what to do with
Cignetti’s 12-19 career record.

Although imprisoned by constant criticism and
looming uncertainty concerning the origin of his next
paycheck, Cignetti insists, as all die-hard coaches do,
on taking things one Saturday at a time.

"It sure doesn't make (coaching) very easy (when
your job is on the line),” Cignetti conceded via
telephone hookup during Tuesday’s Pitt media lun-
cheon. "Hell, I’m just as disappointed as the people
are.

"There’s not much I can do about it now; we're
just concerned about playing every week,” added the

4 during the preseason, “That schedule’s going to'be a

bitch.” Without question, WVU’s lineup card of
opponents reads like a roster for murderer’s row:
four’ of last year’s bowl teams,” including Oklahom
and Penn State, the nation’s top two squads in 1978.

Cignetti maintained a brave preseason optimism,
though. “The best,” he said. But Tuesday Cignetti
added a slight reevaluation: _

“We haven’.t played as wellas I’d hoped,” he said.
“We lost some .key people through injury and were
never able to solidify ourselves.’ ’

Hard hit has been the defense, which, in various
stages of the season, has played without Joe Jelich,
who should start tomorrow, _ Norm Patterson and
Jeff Macerelli, who’s made 111 tackles to lead the
team. '

“We’ve had another problem,” said Cignetti, who
explained that when flanker Cedric Thomas lost his
appendix early in the season, West Virginia lost its
ability to break the long gainer. “We’ve lacked the
big play.’ ’

Thomas is one of 19 Mountaineers wearing a red-

shirt, lending to a depth problem. The weaknesses, q

in fact, go on and on, but Cignetti is relentless.

“I still believe we have the best personnel of any
team since I’ve been coach," he said Tuesday. “The
players are young and have great skill, and I’m
pleased wéth their progress.”

Led by a Philip Haslam hat trick,
West Virginia shut-out the Pitt
soccer team, 3-0, Wednesday night
at Pitt Stadium. The loss, in the ﬁnal
game of the season, dropped the
Panthers’ record below the .500
mark as they ﬁnished their season
with a 6-8 record.

Hampered by a frozen ﬁeld, both
teams found it hard to adapt to such
playing conditions.

“Usually the ‘home team should
have an advantage,” said mid-
ﬁelder Karl Nigh, ‘ ‘but the ﬁeld was
no advantage for us because we took
too long to adapt.”

The Mountaineers were able to
secure their footing throughout the
game and won the contest of slip
and slide.

WVU came into the game with
enthusiasm, which increased when

. Haslam scored his first goal of the

game with only ﬁve minutes gone.
Haslam took a pass from Sung Gul
Cho and shot the ball just past the
outstretched arms of Panther goalie
John BOIIBSSI.‘ '

Soon after, Gal Cho and Haslam

The Panthers ‘seemed to have

returned to the ﬁeld playing a much
more offensive game. Because of
the upsurge in offense .in the second

half, the Panthers outshot WVU ‘

ball into the net.

With 15 minutes remaining in the
game, Gal Cho and Haslam came
