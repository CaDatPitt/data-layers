MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR construction such as the new men’s
dorms may be less feasible without the state funds.

-Men’s. Dorm Moves to Tower

13 Additional

Of the ﬁve floors vacated in the
Student Union Building by the re-
moval of the men’s housing, just
thirteen additional rooms have
been allotted for student activities,

‘according ‘to Frank J. Callanen,
assistant to 'Dr.
.Alan C. Rankin.

Eleven of these rooms have

Student‘Union Board for assign-
ment, and the other two will be

“My brown herringbone topcoat

coldly.

“My father went to Pitt when
it was just a school in a tall
building,” remarked Lora Mend-

freshman. “At ﬁrst, ihe wondered
“at my choice.”

“When my Mother lived in
Pittsburgh, it used to snow soot,
and she had to have her topcoat
cleaned once a week,” related
Terry Sullivan, a future Univer-
sity wrestler from Woxall, Penn-
sylvania.

‘igretted the loss of his coat, he

Zonies came to the orientation
session to take advantage of the
counseling offered. “Everything
depends on the counseling for
the fall. I don’t know much
about the course prerequisites. I
want to take courses that I am

interested in and will do well in. .

I don’At want to waste my time.”

“I was told that Pitt was good
scholastically for getting into grad
school and that it had a good
medical school,” Zonies said. “I
felt that I could study better here
than at home.”

State To Stop Paying
For New Buildings

University Will Make Additional Expenditure
Of $1,370,000 Yearly; May Raise Fee

The state’s recent decision to stop paying for new buildings and other facilities on_

the University’s campus Will mean an additional expenditure of.$l_.370,000 a year, according

to a University. spokesman.

Under the plan, covering four other colleges as

well, the University will haveto pay

the above amount yearly to the General State Authority on three upcoming projects: an
engineering building to be erected on the Logan Armory site,Aa new dental clinic, and a

third natural science building.

, If the three programs are to move forward as planned, said a University spokes-
man, it will mean ﬁnding some new way to pay them off — possibly by cutting out

Rankin, assistant chancellor for
Student and General Affairs.

Helen Poole Rush, Dean of Stu-
dents, has announced that stu-

Future Construction Affected.

The ‘decision would also affect
any futu_re construction that the
University planned to ‘ﬁnance
through the GSA. In past years,
the GSA has built college build-
ings ‘and levied annual charges to
pay the cost. The legislature has
taken over the annual cost each
year, but now those costs will be
left to the colleges.

According to Gov. William G.
Scranton, the decision will ap-
ply only to buildings, to -be
authorized this year and in the
future. Those previously author-
ized total $26 million. Much of
the University’s forthcoming
expansion program has not
cleared the legislature as yet,
and it is in this area that the
GSA will have to be repaid if

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld
and the heads of the other four
schools, that the state must get
out of ﬁnancing private school
construction for a variety of rea-
sons. Mainly, pressures are build-

for the same kind of help, and the
cost is just too much for the state
to handle. A
Effect Not Immediate

The governor later stated that
the GSA cutoff- will not badly
affect the University because the

A cutoff, with the exception of the

dentistry building, will not be felt
for three and one-half years. Also,

construction begin to come due,
the universities will probably" be
receiving greater direct» appro-
priations from the State.

Gov. Scranton plans to work
this fall with the ﬁve uni-
versities to establish a more
lenient repayment plan than is
presently available under the
GSA..

_-_ rage >2 -;—. me 1>rr.'_r-’ NEWS — Wednesday, July 17, 1963 /

In low Puren tis

In last 'We.dnesday’s issue of The Pitt News there was

‘ printed a letter to the editor by a handicapped coed who

asks nothing of this institution exceptthat she and other
students like herself be given the opportunity to “handle our
own problems.”

Shethen qualiﬁed this statement by asking “if we lean
on others now to solve our problems, what happens when
_there’s no one to lean on?”

This is perhaps one of the most dynamic questions which
has ever been put to the student body, especially to the
women students living on campus. And it should not be
restricted in its interpretation merely to the handicapped

- students concerning whom it was originally stated.

No, there is something of much greater importance to,
be considered here — the principle of in loco parentis, the
principle which governs the actions of deari of women’s
oﬁices in this institution and in others throughout the
country. It is the principle that a dean of women has the
right and the obligation to _assume the responsibility of a
parent to all women who come under her authority,/espe-
cially resident students. It is a theory concocted out of the
ancient idea that a girl ‘should be placed in a convent at-
mosphere until she is morally strong enough to face the
world on her own, and it is a theory which should have

been knocked into a cocked hat at the same time that

women assumed equal status with men, but it has not. It is
still prevalent in the modern university of today, and is
likely to remain so because of the absolute puritanical power
which deans of women "wield in their various institutions
throughout the republic.

And the only serious argument in its behalf is that
this is the way the parents of the girls concerned would
wish it to be. Freedom for their children is a dreadful
thought to most parents, for under all the vocal trust which
mothers give to their girls before they send them off to
college, there still remains the deepseated fear that they
will be corrupted by the new environment. Thus, deans of
women and their like have the almost complete support
of parents and it is upon this_basis that they run their or-
ganizations.

Yet, it is a logically shaky basis, for if the purpose of
an institution of higher learning is to instruct and to pre-
pare young adults to assume a useful place in our society,
then any restriction of the learning process is a crime against
education. And if the archaic attitude which the principle“
of in loco parentis represents is not such a crime then there
is nodiﬁerence .between infancy and adulthood and one
can learn no more in college than a list of the kings of Ire-
land. But, it is a crime, because college as a learning process
is much more than lectures and seminars; it is, or should" be,
a place to learn of life, of its complications and of its respon-
sibilities. And any principle which seeks to retard such '
learning by creating another home, another infancy, for its
pupils is nothing more than a throwback to the ancient idea
of convent education.

Possibly the alternative, that of complete freedom to
climb to adulthood through experience, is rather "blood-
thirsty, for not all can make the grade," but it is at least
realistic and consistent with the facts of life. In any case,
forced propriety is certainly not the correct path to ma-
turity. .

Our position, therefore, is not to question the authority
or the power of our’s or any other dean of women, but it is
to question the principle on which that authority and that
‘power is based. \ I
‘ ‘ Male students at this institution are given the oppor-
tunity to learn their worth through trial and error -
through living —— and the University’s coeds should be
extended the same privilege. « ‘

Their attitude should be the same as that of the woman
whose letter appeared in this paper: “I demand from you
and from life the right to fail,” and they should be given
that right.

American Negro Revolution . . .

It Can Happen Here

The government of the United States has on its
hands what is quickly and alarmingly amounting
to a full scale revolution. '

The battle for equal rights being waged ,by
America’s Negroes is no longer a question of
isolated sit-ins, squat-ins, stand-ins, dance-ins,
fall-ins or what have you. It has grown to col-
ossal- proportions, proportions that oversize any-
thing that any modern American has seen in his
lifetime.

Yet to most Amercians it is not a revolution,
but an extension of the anti-segregation activity
which has been vicariously a part of their lives
for ten years.

Occurrences in" Cambridge, Md., Savannah, Ga.,
Jackson, Miss., Chicago and New York are in-
teresting little news items to be read in the local
newspaper and dismissed‘ with a slow shake of the
head and a complacent “tsk-tsk.”

Perhaps it is the site of this revolution‘ which
people refuse to believe and avoid facing up to.
After all, it doesn’t seem possible that the United
States, the world’s greatest nation, could be torn
by revolution. It's such a civilized country. ‘Or
perhaps it is because it seems like just some more
of what has taken place in the past. Or maybe

?it’s just that_Americans don’t know a revolution

when they see one close up.

What Else? _

What else could it be called? Many have been
killed, hundreds injured and thousands jailed.
What does it take to make a revolution? Cer-
tainly nothing more than what is happening right
now in this country’.

There is nothing in racial demonstrations to-
day which essentially distinguishes them from any
other revolution which has gone before in-history.
The demonstrations are violent and often bloody.
The French, American and Russian revolutions

In preparation for a recent English literature
test on Edmund Spenser, I reread the assigned
portions of The Faery Queen over one weekend.

What a natural for the ‘movies. The scope of

a movie.where'knights, fair ladies, evil demons,’

and satyrs run in and out of enchanted ‘forests,
aforementioned knights slay each other and drag-

ons, and various luscious maidens are tempted by ,

various horrible creatures! As I drifted into un-
consciousness I could see an epic Hollywood pro-
ducer drooling out of the side’ of his mouth that
was not folded around a huge and very mushy
cigar. ‘

The first book concerns the Redcrosse Knight
—— representing mankind —— who goes to rescue
the parents of a maiden, -—— Una - truth — from a
dragon. On the way he must contend with~an
evil magician Archimago - lawlessness, and
another dragon — error. All this is just a brief
outline of the ﬁrst of twelve projected books sup-
posed to deal with twelve virtues. There then
can be, in the Hollywood sense of the word, a
MESSAGE.

Nightmare Begins _

In my dream I was seated in some obscure
theater, surrounded by sex-hungry‘ teenagers,
sour-faced teachers of English literature, and sul-
len ushers. The movie began.

The screen went black for a moment, then scar-
let letters, fashioned like lightning strokes ﬂash-
ed into view. The background music was the
ﬁnale from Handel’s Mesiah.

" . . . Pictures present BOWER OF TEMPTA-
TION from a story by Edmundgspenser.” Evi-
dently, Hollywood has been afraid that ‘the orig-
inal title would be misunderstood. I closed my
eyes while the cast. was announced, in order to
be pleasantly surprised when the actual movie
began, but I could hear the oh’s and ah’s of the

audience as they saw the cast for their sneak

preview.

The music became soft and" postoral, ‘Green-_
sleeves, inevitably, so I opened. my eyes. There

were also violent, though more sanguinary. In
some places the demonstrations are peaceful. The

1933 National Socialist revolution in Germany was

also accomplished by generally peaceful means.
Those who perpetrate the American Negro Rev-‘

olution desire to_ drastically alter the status quo. 9.
’This is the aim of all revolutionaries.

The American Negro. Revolution, in fact,’ is
characteristic of all previous revolutions, prob-
ably because of the tremendous sixe of the battle-
ﬁeld. It covers more areas and issues-than either
the Civil War or American Revolution.

‘But it covers such a large area, that it has not
reached or effected the .majority of citizens. And
it is perhaps this which prevents the reality of
revolt from penetrating people’s minds.

The U. S. is No Different ~ v

The ‘United States government is like any
other government in that it too is susceptible" to
revolution. This perhaps is a dilﬁcult thing to
realize because until now revolution in this coun-
try has been accomplished through the vote. The
process, however, is slow, almost evolutionary,
and now many people can’t wait. Besides, When
there are many people who cannot exercise their

right to vote, they revolt through other means. is

The individual. demonstrations *are widely?‘

separated around the country, but Joe Citizen
must overcomethe tendency to regard each dem-
onstration separately. They are not spontaneous.

They are planned, "planned by mother organiza-. .

tions at headquarters in key areas.

That’s revolution, brother, not just demonstra-
tion or protestation. The situation is going to get
worse before it gets better, and when ‘historians
of the year 2000'write about the early 1960’s, they ‘-3
are not going to write about anti-discrimination};

demonstrations. They aregoing to write about an

American Negro Revolt.

' he was —- that gentle knight Spenser describes in

the opening of his book, pricking down the plain
with the fair maiden Una, on his way to rescue
her parents. Somehow I hadn’t expected to see’

Elizabeth.T-aylor as Una (truth) was another ‘r

Student Records’
Offices to Move
To Ground Floor

To reduce student traffic in the
elevators, the Offce of Student Re-
cords is being moved from the
18th ,to the ground floor of the

"Cathedral, according to Richard

Hodges, director of Student Re-
cords.

The move will be made to the

. Forbes Street side of the building

during the ﬁrst ‘part of August in
time for registrationfor the Fall
trimester.

The beginning’ of remodeling
of the old locker—room for office
space was responsible for last
week’s' mix-up in which stu-
dents arrived to ﬁnd their‘ lock-
ers cleaned out and‘ moved else-
where following last-minute no-
tiﬁcation to the University Po-
lice that the space must be ‘va-
cated.

Hodges feels that the move will
beof particular advantage to the

students, -many of whom never‘

have to go above the_ third floor‘
for their classes. It should mini-
mize time wasted in the elevators
tremendously, he said.

While completely rejecting di-

the journal of the American Med-

method of indirect observation.
The viewer should stand about 10

She expects the advisers to aid

Having lived in a small town,
Miss Mendlovitz decided that
she wanted to go to a big school
that would, in addition, offer
her many extra-curricular ac-
tivities ‘that she could not par-

In large agreement with Zonies

and Sullivan, Miss Mendlovitz felt

that the tuition rates are too high.

what you pay for, and for what
were paying, I’m assuming that I
am getting quality. I have heard
that- there are many top-notch
professors at Pitt, and I am’look-

wrestles in the 123-140 lb. weight
class went undefeated during the
regular season and placed second
in the state in his division.

“I was told that the steel mills
kept Pittsburgh from being a

Sullivan came to the University
in March, the wrestling coach
took him on a tour of the city
and proved conclusively that the
sun did not set at noon in Pitts-
burgh. ‘

_A deciding factor in Sullivan’s
choice of schools was wide range
of subject matter taught here and
the ability to switch from one de-

get into engineering because my
high school background wasn’t
right. If I can get the background
here in liberal arts, I can transfer
over to the Engineering depart-

lot of merit in the upper class
counseling program for the male
students. “You can get closer to an
upperclass counselor than you
can to an adult, They know more
of what you want and can answer
your questions better.”

Sullivan’s overall attitude re-
flects the opinion of all three
freshman. “I won’t feel sure of
myself until I get into the routine
in, the fall. You have to get off to
a good start; a bad start means
trouble for four years.”

Terrible
Swift Sword

By MATTHEW SWETONIC

The Civil War was an.

amazing period in the his-
tory of the Republic. It was
a time when the idea of so-
cial revolution was more
frightful than that of politi-.
cal rebellion, and when politics
decided the outcome of mare
military campaigns than did
battles; or so claims Bruce Cat-
ton in Terrible Swift Sword
(Doubleday, 559 pages, $7.50),
the second volume of‘ his Cen-
tennial History of the Civil War.

Starting with the chaotic per-
iod following the meeting of the
armed mobs at first Bull Run,
Catton traces the history of the
rebellion from the little standup
ﬁght at Wilson’s Creek in Mis-
souri to the struggle of the
giants on the banks of the An-
tietam in the autumn of ’62.

Clear and Detailed

If nothing else, his narrative is
painstakingly clear and as
crammed full of detail as space
will allow. Catton leaves noth-
ing to chance and wishes to
make sure that the reader can-
not possibly misunderstand each
and every point he is trying to
make. And, strangely enough,
he succeeds in every attempt ex-
cept where it comes to his main
theme.

Catton’s prime contention is
that the war, which started as
a limited contest to preserve_

‘ the Union, soon got completely
out of hand and developed
into a social revolution for the
freeing of the slaves.

Through chapter after chap-
ter, Catton keeps hammering
away at this point in all its var-
ied aspects. Both Lincoln and
Jefferson Davis, he claims, were
afraid of the slavery question
but the war grew just too com-
plicated to be continued without

' carrying it into the higher plane

of a struggle for human free-
dom.

The Union, he contends, would
never have endured for another
year had not Lincoln issued the
Emancipation Proclamation. Eng-
land was at the point of recog-
nizing the Confederacy, and the
Royal Navy would have snapped
the Union ‘blockade with one
stroke and almost guaranteed
southern independence, but by
raising the hue and cry against
slavery, Lincoln forever shat-
tered the south’s hope of recog-
nition and consequently, of
victory.

In fact, Catton pushes his
point so strongly and so often
that it takes on the guise. of a
sermon.

Seldom does a battle or
even a skirmish pass without
Catton jumping in to shout:
“See, this proves it also!” «

Yet, he is never quite con-
vincing. There is always the
shadow of doubt hanging over
his proof, and perhaps that is
the reason why he belabors the
point so that it almost becomes
ridiculous.

Politics Enters Also ,

His book is also about politics.

It is about the politics which de-
stroyed McClellan on the Penin-
sula and Pope on the Bull Run
and his arguments are certainly
convincing, but he sadly neglects
the talents of one Robert E. Lee.
' Catton, whose previous
books on the Civil War all
showed the struggle from the
northern viewpoint, again
leaves the south pretty much
in the dark. If Lee was the
great general which Catton
claims then he certainly does
not give him sufficient credit
for his achievements.

On the whole, the book is en-
tirely too one-sided. There is
too much about the troubles of
the Union and not enough con-
cerning the South, and the result
is a shitty narrative which does
not shift in the right directions.

’Soc Chairman Reports i

Disarmament Findings

Dr. Jiri Nehnevajsa, chairman

of the sociology department, re-

ported his ﬁndings on the dis-

armament problem to the Con-
gress of Scientists on Survival in

New York last month.

According to Dr. Nehnevajsa

parliamentarians and university

students in Germany, France,

Japan, Spain, Brazil, and Finland
would rather see disarmament end

the Cold War than any of 34
other alternatives posed to them,
including anti»-Communist revolu-
tions in the Communist countries.
Only United States-Soviet re-
conciliation ranks anywhere near
global disarmament as the most
desirable way for the Cold War
to end. _
Based on Samplings
The ﬁndings are based on at-
titude samplings taken abroad
from 1960_ through 1962 under the
sponsorship of the behavioral sci-
ence division of the Air Force
Office of Scientiﬁc Research. Dr.
Morris Berkowitz of the socio-
logy department read the paper.
Although they desire dis-
armament, less than one-fourth
of the respondents in any of the
countries expect to see it end
the Cold War. A rising percent-
age of those sampled feel that
the arms. race will continue in-
deﬁnitely, including 85 per cent
of France’s parliamentarians.

One of the study’s most im-
portant ﬁndings, according to the

sociologist, may be that, while the
respondents insist that global dis-
armament must be well policed,
they are quite responsive to limit-
ed (nuclear) disarmament steps
without controls. _ ‘
Other Findings Revealed

Among other ﬁndings revealed
by the study were’:

The respondents desire world-
wide disarmament with a UN po-
lice force organized to enforce it,
but they do not expect it.

They ‘do not foresee disarma-
ment by any nations except the
US and USSR, nor do they want
it. a

They would ﬁnd nuclear dis-
armament without controls quite
acceptable but they do not thin
it will happen. ‘

The greater number expect
what they believe the Soviet
Union desires —- disarmament

without controls — but they do
not want it as much as what they
believe the US wants — disarma-
ment with controls.
