ost Office, 3October,24, 1911,

cl for in $ection

There are two items of much signiﬁcance in this week’s Univer-

sity news. One is that/3only $890 out of $2,000 had been received by I

the Young Women ’s Christian Association in its campaign for funds

and the other that the Young Men ’sIChristianAss0ciation, its broth-.

I or organization, will begin its annual drive next Monday.
Integral par I of the University life, both of these Iorganizati
need and deserve théﬁ support of the student body. If the girls of the

ODS

University respond only to the extent of raising less‘ than one—half

or they must be totally unaware of the I.se3rvLic3Ies which lL:heIYI.LW- C3-

I has rendered Pitt since its location on the campus.  I ‘

Monday, we were greeted by the ‘slogan, “Beat Syracuse,” printed

on a White banner and pLromin'entlyI located 3I on the Automotive Ens

The Pitt Freshmen took a. well—oon-
tested, if rather easy game from Vtbeir
old enemies, the VV. Va. Freshmen, at
Morgantowll last Saturday by the

 

V took an early lead when in the ﬁrst
few minutes‘ of play they took the ball
down ,the ﬁeld in an Virresistible sweep
of straight football tactics and then
scored on Johns_on’s plunge ‘through
right tackle. From this point on the
game was an "assured Panther victory,
although at no point in the game did
the pp Mountaineers lose their ﬁghting
spirit. On the contVraryV_they.braced
in the third quarter ‘and, due to the‘
‘fact that Coach? Kerr had made quite
a few substitutions, held the Panthers;
scoreless. ‘ ’ _V«

All in all, it was a great day. for the
Cubs, and while ‘tlleyproved that they
could overcome the playing of such
stars V as ‘Grant Hall,‘ Egbert and
Quaries ofthie Mountaineer team they
also demonstrated that in this year’s

Syracuse Has Fine Record to

at>Forbes Field

When the Syracuse UniversityVfoo=t-
ball teamme-ets Pitt this Saturday at
Forbes Field intheir annual gridiron
struggle, the great Orange‘-._will be in-
vading the lair of the Panther for the
first time in three years. This will be
‘the ‘fifth time, however, that the two
teams will have opposed each other.
Pitt and Syracuse ﬁrst met in 1916 at
Syracuse.’ That year our team, de-
spite the fact that they were picked
by most authorities to be easily do-
feated, trimmed Syracuse 30-0. The
following year Pitt again defeated the
Orangeeleven, thi,s,,,,,,t,i1ne by a 28-0
score. In 1918 the two schools did
not stage a grid contest, but in the
following year they resumed hostili-
ties, That day Pitt was defeated for‘
the ﬁrst time in the ﬁve years Glen
_Wa.rner had been coaching our foot-
ball team. Syracuse managed not
only to defeat us, but also to wallop
us. iThe ﬁnal scor'e,Vwas 24-3. ‘

Last year we again traveled tVo“Sy-
racuse. That game; at Archbold. Sta-
dium will never be forgotten. The
greater part of the contest was played
‘in a veritable sea. of mud. In the ﬁrst
half, a Syracuse back fumbled a punt
-on his own 25-yard line and Stein re-
covered it for Pitt. Then a series‘ of
[well diversiﬁed plunges and runs car-
ried the ball over the goal line, Hewitt
scoring the touchdown. V '

The rain, however, continued to fall.
The ﬁeld and ball became so wet that
perfect handling of the spheroid was

_.‘ hardly to be expected. Finally, in the

last‘ quarter, Gulick, a Syracuse
tackle, ‘picked up. a Panther fumble
and raced 42 yards for the touchdown

that tied the score» ’ it '

Three days hence this man, Gulick,
who is now captain, ~» will lead the
_0'range team onto. Forbes Field -inan
