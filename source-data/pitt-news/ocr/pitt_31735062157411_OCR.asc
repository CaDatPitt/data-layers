Gives‘ Hoosiers- Edge

a They May Not Rate -

. By MYRON KOPELMAN
Two words that probably carry more weight than any

 't ,j’other pair in the football vernacular are “Big Nine.”

, Ifvit were not for those two words, Indiana might not
have been setup as seven to thirteen-point favorites over Pitt

 in tomorrow’s stadium presentation.
 , Observers who have seen‘
that there is really little to fear from the inexperienced Bloom-

the -Hoosiers in action believe

ington boys. They are no longer listed in the Dun & Brad-
._ street of the Midwest——they’re «deﬁnitely among the needy
I V this year. ' '
But because the tag “Big Nine” has always meant high
class merchandise, the bookies are playing safe and giving

Pitt the short end of the odds._

To be sure, the Panthers’ chances of victory are not great,

but, nevertheless, several factoise

point to Pitt’s advantage. . _

In the ﬁrst ‘place, the spirit of
the Hoosier schoolboys has drop-
ped _f1=om their hearts to their
ankles since they were beaten by
Texas Christian and Ohio State.

.»No Reserves

Secondly, Indiana is so short on
capable and experienced reserves
that Coach Clyde Smith has had
to turn his regulars into a gang
of 60 Vminute men. In the Mid-
west, they’re known as “Smith’s
Iron Men.”

,If the iron was durable, there
Vwould be no cause for concern on
—Smith’s part. But at the“root of
Indiana’s two defeats is the fact
that the Iron Men tired as time

wore on, and the opposing ends‘

began to outscoot the Hoosier sec-

"ondary to haul in a rich crop of
passes. ‘

Of course, the. Hoosiers have

Director Harvey Pope has had
two dress rehearsals Tuesday’ and
Wednesday.

The show marks several new
steps in Players’ policy. Starting
this fall, the group is making a
deﬁnite bid’ for city-wide recog-
nition in dramatic circles. In line
with this idea, season subscrip-
tion tickets at $3 for four produc-
tions are being offered at the Stu-
dent Desk.

Another innovation came as a

result of a request that more First

Nighters be allowed to see Play-
ers ‘behind the scenes’ show given
at an informal reception every
year. In past years, Players have
invited close friends to a Friday
night take-off skit of each pro-
duction. This year, the informal
reception will be thrown open to

- the entire opening night audience

in the Foster Hall social room,
below the auditorium. .

Individual tickets for any one -

of the three performances may be
bought at the Student Desk at $1
for reserved ﬁrst ﬁo'oVr’ seats and
75 cents for general admission

Band director Robert L. Arthur

another hour to put the instru-

was little possibility of their
playing today unless they could

A BLOW TO PLAYERSI

Because of a misunderstanding or a.-mistake in connec-
tion with the University Social Calendar, the Pitt Players will
. . . / . ‘

put on their “Philadelphia Story” before what threatens to

The reason: Panhellenic reception takes place the same
evening. The reception shapes up as a cinch to claim the un-
divided attention of some 600 to 700\women. lIt’s practically
compulsory fordsorority women and freshman girls.

So that ’s the way it stands. And it looks as though that’s

the way it will stand on‘ Saturday night because no one seems »
|

to have the power or the inclination ‘to change it.

Student Congress doesn't have the power to intervene.
The committee that shaped the social calendar thinks the
Players knew about it all the time. ’l‘he Players think there ’s
been a terrible mistake.

And they’re right. As a. student activity Pitt Players de-
pend on student support. A11d that includes ﬁnancial support.
To continue in operation Players must morelor less pay for it-
self, It’s a little diﬁicult to do.that when they're running in
competition with the school and with organizations that can
compel their members to attend functions. ’ _ .

Even if there were no ﬁnancial worries there’s the moral-
effect of playing before any empty house. After many weeks
of preparation it is more than slightly discouraging to put
on  show‘ for the beneﬁt of blank rows of seats.

\V’e don’t know who is at fault but there should be’ some
permanent machinery set up to correct such obvious injustices.
Student Congress wouldseem to be the obvious choice, since
most of the activities on the-social calendar are sponsored by
students. But whether it is Congress or some other 'organiza-
tion is of little importance. The important thing is to put an

Sense-Les

By LES GALLAGHER

On the other side of Panther
Hollow is situated a group of
buildings. This scatted assemblage
of huts is known as Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology. This school
has done everything short of mak-
ing their players pay for their
uniforms, to discourage the spir-
ited sport of football. With this
being the system it is no wonder
that the Terrible“ Turks of Tech
have lost 21'_in a row. But the
more they lose the closer comes
I predict that
someday Carnegie-Tech will win
a football game. Remember you
read it in this column ﬁrst. And

- when that day comes, Pitt students-,

I say, beware. We shall have a
ﬁght on our hands, the blood will
run red and warm in the streets.

Last year when we won the

av Ohio State _game . a few thousand
of us linked arms and swept across

the Tech campus scattering may

roofs, threw a couple of the Tech
janitors and faculty under a street
car just -for laughs and in gen-
eral were our own cute selves. But

few Pitt students know that last
year Carnegie Tech nearly won a
football game. They came‘ within
the length of a lint of beating a
little university in Ohio, Case by
name.

Dire Plofs .Were Ploffed

And _if_ they would have won
this aforementioned contest, there
would have been commotion in
the commons and a ﬁght upon the‘
greens. Carnegie Tech had it
planned that they would wreck
the Cathedral of Learning imme—.
diately following this game from
which their not-to—be-denied war-
riors would emerge victorious.
But their plan was stymied. The
poor hopefulfools were defeated.
Little Case, out of Ohio, and sired
by fortitude, came from behind to
win 20-13, or some comparable
score. So Tech with a tear in their
eye and a curse onher lips laid,
aside their plans. The U. of P. was

-spared. A crisis was averted. The

ﬁre hoses were recircled and hung
reluctantly back on the hooks.
Once again it was peace‘ in our-
time. But that was last year and
now they play Case once again.

end to schedule clashes that hurt activities. (
It is probably too late to do anything about next Satur-

day night._ Players certainly cannot cancel their show at this

 
 
 

late ‘date. It doesn’t seem likely that Panhel would agree to
postpone its reception.

But with this incident as an example it would be inex-
cusable if a-similar conﬂict should arise in the future.

Forbes the Tartans meet an un-
derdog Case. Tonight, the "Tech
campus is dimly lit and foul deeds
are in preparation. Tonight, their
hatred burns hard and there is
mumbling in the halls of Margaret
Morrison. '

They Think They_'H Win

Steins of beer are being raised
to the dusty rafters and cries of
revenge reverberate across the
ﬁelds and down the stairs to the
corner where Morewood greets
Forbes. Pit-t students, our enemy
anticipates a victory on the mor-
row. And if little Case is not equal
to the task for a second time, the
Tarts’ of Tech will descend upon
our fair University in the manner
of locust on the waves of the wind._
Why stand ye here idle? We must
unite and march out to meet our
foe on the no man’s land of Schen-

in behind the ramparts of the Ca-
thedral. We must, in the event’ of
an emergency, not wait for the
attackers but meet them at the
bridge. The dug trench, or the
barbed wire is a passive sign of
resistance.

We will met them at their own
gates and crush their offensive in
its infancy. Onward and upward,

Music Notes

Tomorrow at the Field called

and Art Lund’s buttered tonsils latch on to this with -the?

-Fred Waring and His» Pennsylvafnians will make a personal 

fappearance at the Syria Mosque on VVednesday evening, Octo-

ber 27.

. Fred \Varing, who made the Pennsylvaniaiis a_ by-word in .1
virtually ev_ery,An_1er1can home and theater,. has one of the
largest musical aggregations in the country as well as one off‘
the longest success records in show business. . '

Back in 1916 he started the -band,‘ “Waring Ba.njaz- ..
zatra.” and jumped from college dates to vaude bookings O"
in Detroit and Chicago. One of the ﬁrst orchestras to
broadcast over the radio, his initial broadcast was over
WWJ, Detroit. After six years’ of theater dates, he went to
Paris in 1927 and played the Caf cles Ambassadeurs and
gave concerts at the Paris Opera. House. He appeared. in
three B’Way revues, and was musical director of the Roxy A

‘ Theater in New York in 1932. It was in 1933 that Waring
and his group landed their ﬁrst air commercial——they have-
n’t been off the air since. . .
, \Varing’s “ﬁrsts” also include the first all—musical movie,
“snycopation,” the ﬁrst popular record with vocal chorus: ,
and ﬁrst orchestra to use glee club effects in popular broad-l
cast. .
Giving equal attention to classics, popular ballads, folk‘
songs and hymns VVaring’s concert will show Pittsburghers,
why after all these years he is still tops. '

If youcan afford an evening at the Carousel than by
all means get down there and see TOMMY DIX» and
CHARLEY CHAN EY. Tommy is that mighty baritone mite
who appeared in the‘ motion pic “Best Foot Forward.”
He really does a swell job on “Old Man River” and
“Buckle Down Winsocki.” As _for Chaney “The Unpre-
dictable Comedian” the guy’s really ‘funny. You'll really
get a load of laughs when he does his Amos and ‘Andy hat
routine. If you take a date who is naive I ‘would suggest
that you use some cotton when Chaney sings his parodies.

Seniorsent
To Hospital by
Lab Explosion

The chemistry department’s ﬁrst
serious accident in‘75 years sent
a senior to the hospital Monday.
Listed as in “good condition”
yesterday by Aspinwall Veterans
Hospital is Sidney Lippman. He
was injured Monday morning
when an explosion of chemicals
sent glass ﬂying into the left side
of his face and his left eye.
According to witnesses, Lipp-
man, a chemistry major, -was
working in Alumni Hall on an
experiment using di-acetone-al-
cohol. He was turned partially
away from his experiment look-
ing into his locker when the ma-
terial he was working with blew
up, shattering the experiment ap-
paratus and cracking laboratory
windows.

Lippman was given ﬁrst aid by
Malcolm F. Dull, in charge of the
lab, and Alexander Silverman,
head of the department, and re-
ceived further treatment at the
University Eye and Ear Hospital
before being sent to Aspinwall.

The hospital said Lippman will
probably stay several weeks for
x—rays and observation on his eye.
It declined comment on whether
Lippman would lose the sight in
his left eye.

Cause of the explosion remains
a mystery. Lippman’s materials,
all non-explosive, were checked
by Doctor Dull ten minutes be-
fore they blew up. It is fortunate
that Lippman was not hovering
over his apparatus when the ex-
plosion occurred, Doctor Silver-
man said yesterday.

Davis’ Loses His Shirt;
Also Suits and Coats

BY JOHN RICOTTA

There isn’t anything like a good practical education.
Ask someone who knows. Ask Joe Davis.
Davis, a trusting soul from Masontown, Pa., besides carrying 16

regular credits has just completed a rapid unregistered course on
why locks- are on automobiles. 9

This extra-curricular course, at V
<n_o—credit, one-evening aﬁair, oc-
curred two weeks ago. The then
roomless Davis, inspired by re-
ports of a vacancy in the Cathe-
dral district, parked his car and
went to investigate. 5

He left the car unlocked. There
was nothing unusual about that.
He‘ always did. But this time on
the back seat were two suits, three
sport coats, twelve shirts, and nu-
merous other bits of closetless ~
clothing.

Davis, normally a young man
with a. smile as wide as the grill
on his 1948 Dodge, was beaming
an extra wide smile of success
when he came back to the car.
But one look in the back and an-
other at the license plate for as-
surance, and he was biting his
lips to control his anger.

_His faith in the honesty of his
fellow man visibly shaken, Davis
found it difficult. to speak. But
when chided with “we told you
something like this would happen
some day,” shrugged it off with
a seeming reaffirmation of his
faith in the basic honesty of man.

“It never hapened before, and _
will probablyinever happen again. .’
Crooks like that are one in a mil-
lion. Besides, maybe they needed
the stuff more than I did.”

But, as at love and lunch, action
still speaks louder than words.
Davis now locks his car——always.

Dave Devy Sparks Phys Eds
--To 26-7 Win Over Comets

Sharp passing by Dave Devy sparked the Phys Ed .5’s

 to a 26-7 win over the Comets, at'Trees Field, Tuesda.y, in the

R ﬁrst IM game for the two teams.
The diminutive tailback threw three touchdown aerials
and set up the fourth with passes. The Comets scored the ﬁrst
time they had the ball on a 40-yard pass from George Bradle

 to Jim Oberle.

Twogtouchdown passes by Devy,

 one covering 70 yards to Curtis
Pettis, and the other a short ﬂip

to Hal Wertman gave the Phy
'_Ed’s a 13-7 halftime lead. ‘
In the ﬁnal period,_the winners

The Civils doggedly maintained

, of the third --period. It was then

that Bill Ferguson, who tallied the

first Pet TD, tossed a 40-yard pass

to Jack Leonard, standing in the
Civil end zone.

Afforded good protection, Fer-
guson had plenty of time to spot
Leonard and hit him with the
aerial.

The losers grabbed their early
lead when John Lapp ﬁred to Pat
Welsh for the touchdown, then to
Ray Walker for the extra point.

A second-quarter heave from
Bill Davis to Ferguson moved the

Civils. Ferguson nabbed the pass

on the Civil ten and scampered to

of their chances.

‘By BOB VAN ATTA
If spirit and morale mean anything;'Pitt’s hustling Panthers
will ﬁnd themselves late tomorrow afternoon with the longest

victory Skein in 10 years. Although Indiana ’s-invading Hoosiers
are favored, the morale of Mike Milligan’s men bespeaks well

This improved hustle, helped immeasurably by the West
Virginia and Marquette successes, is particularly evident in the

'sion Tuesday evening under the
lights showed vicious tackling that
would be a credit in any game.
Yost Making Bid

Chuck Yost, a spirited sopho-
more guard, is making competition
stiff for starting -guard berths.
Bernie Barkouskie and Chuck

 Thomas are keeping them by a
' bare margin over the Youngstown
i husky.

Trainer Howard Waite’s casu-
alty list is more encouraging this
week. Of three tackles on it last
week, Sam Haddad, the husky

: New Castle battlement, is ready
 to go.

The other two, Wib Forsythe
and Ralph Short, are working out
with the pads on and will be ready
to go next week, at least. Guard
Tony Razzano and Halfback Bill
Bruno are out for the season.

Lauro Ready to Go

To further bolster the tackles,
Flint Greene, compact New Kens-
ington sophomore guard, has been
moved next-door to tackle.

Following the resurgence of Bill
Abraham last week, and Abie’s
new lease on life, a good bet in to-
morrow’s game would be left half-
back Lindy Lauro. Hampered
early this .fall by injuries, Lindy
is rarin’ to go.

‘Milligan’s starting lineup will
probably be the same as that
which answered the opening whis-
tle last Saturday.

, Longest Streak Looms
' Not since Charley Bowser’s, 1939
Panthers won their first three
games from Washington,- West
Virginia, and Duke, has a Pitt
eleven taken three in succession.

Since impotent Western Reserve
is on the card for next Saturday,
an upset of the Hoosiers would set
the stage for the longest winning
streak S. S. (Since Sutherland).

It is toward that aim that de-

sharpness have been designed.

Phi Delts Slam

Alpha Phi Delta

Scoring in every period, the Phi
Delts smothered a ﬁghting but
outclassed Alpha Phi Delta six,
39-0. The Phi Delts were led by
the sharp and accurate passing of
Jim Hornick who threw ﬁve
touchdown passes. I-lornick start-
ed the TD parade in the ﬁrst pe-
riod with a 20-yard aerial to Bob
Grigsby.

Two hard charging lines faced
each other and held the ground
attack to minus yardage. A weak
pass defense by the Alpha Phi
Delta’s enabled Hornick to hit his
receivers with almost dull regu-
larity.

Hornick passed to Joe Perko-
vich in the second quarter for a
TD on a play that ate up 64 yards.
In the second half Grigsby got be-
hind" the defensive backﬁeld and
snagged a I-Iornick pass and raced
60 yards for a touchdown. Alpha
Phi Delta, conquerors of the
PiKA’s defending champs, could
not cope with the Phi Delts.

SAE Yellow Jackets
Rout Stray Greeks

SAE’,s Yellow Jackets waltzed
to a 38-0 rout of an outclassed but
not outspirited Stray Greek force
at Schenley Oval last Friday.

The ﬁrst quarter as a scoring
marathon. Bob McCurdy galloped
across from 30 yards out for the
ﬁrst score. Two
touchdown passes -from Bob Mil-
ler to Paul Courtney and Paul
Lutes. ‘

Don Q’Rourke ﬁgured promi-
nently in the game’s trickiest play
and the ﬁnal TD. He reversed to
Corky Evans, who passed to

Courtney, who in turn lateralled

to O’Rourke on a 40-yard play.

Kappa Nu Triumphs
in Battle of Lowlys'

Kappa Nu’s 12-6 victory over
Sigma Chi at Schenley Oval, Tues-
day, was their ﬁrst win of the
year. The losers have yet to tri-
umph.

Dave Hausman’s pass intercep-

tion on the KN 15 was run back
all the way for the ﬁrst score.
Sigma’s Sweethearts deadlocked
in the third quarter. After Jim
Dawes’ interception, Torn Roy
aerialed to Norm Parkins for the
score.

With two minutes left, Bob
Kramer heaved a long pass to
Hausman for the TD that meant
victory.

Meanwhile, Dean Doc Giﬂfin

Research Profs
Develop New

Dirt Gobbler "

A mechanical monster has
been developed by two retail
training research men.

Harry F. Lewis and George
Whitten designed it and Nor-
man Wackenhut of the engi-
neering department built it.
This monster is called a “D00-
dlebug” and gobbles dirt with
gusto. Its primary purpose is to
clean department store rugs.

Since a Westinghouse Electric
survey pointed out that Pitts-
burg gets dirty at the rate of
1950 tons a month, it might be
said that the “Doodlebug” is
_worth its weight in dirt.

John Marshall
Taps Members

John Marshall Club, pre-legal
honorary fraternity, abandons its
traditional method of tapping this
fall and will put the initiative
upon the students themselves.

Prior to this year members at-
tempted looking through the thou-

sands of grade reports to deter-'

mine which students have the
three qualiﬁcations for member-
ship. These are: 45 credits com-
pleted, an average of 2.0 or above,
and the intent to enter law school.
This fall, however, all pre-legal
students who meet these require-
ments and are interested in being
tapped to John Marshall are asked
to leave their names with Miss
Ruth Westwood in the office of the
dean of men before Nov. 1. '

This new, direct method, of tap— , _
