session which witiicsseil fact-

lnony.

lvlethodically following its case. the
University presented lirst Jolm
Quick, registrar. who showed records
refuting the statement of Dr. Ralph
E. Turner, former history professor,
that the 26 professors who had signed
a Liberal club petition in 1929 were
“marked men.”

Dr. John G. Bowman, Chancellor of
the University, took the stand Satur-
day morning to review his wo1'k here
and toexplain t.he reasons for Dr.
Ralph T. Tiirner’s dismissal last year.

“If I made a mistake in.tl1is case,"
he addressed the ﬁve-man probing
board, “it was in not removing this
man three or four years before I dit .”
At each of the annual receptions for
parents of freslimen, he pointed out,
15 to 25 parents would come to him,
telling of the unsatisfactory influence
Dr, Turner had been upon their chil-
dren's religious beliefs.

In March of 1934, the Cliancellor
went on, he told the Executive coin-
mittee of the Board of Trustees, “W e
cannot go with this man.” VVl1en
asked why he had then waited until
the summer to dismiss Dr. Turner, Dr.
Bowman asserted, "I wanted to give
him a year’s salary. Incidentally, we
were conducting a $700,000 campaign
at the time, and I wanted nothing to
hinder it. The latter, however, was
of little importance.”

Deﬁning his iiiterpretation of aca-
(leinic. freedom, he stated, “Academic
freedom is the privilege to devote
oneself to study and research and to
publish tlic results. It is not the
privilege toengage in partisan pro-
paganda. and to expect the University
to protect the professor from the ‘re-
stilts.”

“Tenure is not so permanent here
as I would like it,” Dr. Bowman con-
tinued, “but we have been unwilling
to pledge outgo against indeﬁnite in-
come.” Concerniiig the teaching staff.
he re1narked,_“That faculty is ’way
above what Pittsburgh knows and
what Peniisylvania knows.”

"When he ca.me to the University in
1921, he revealed, Pitt. was-. “the most
drastic situation of need in the Unit-
ed States." Only one-fourth of the
necessary space was available, many
temporary buildings were used as
classrooms. and a burden of debt
hung upon the institution.

Since 1921, he went on, “we have re-
ceived 20 million dollars in gifts.”
Compared with the 1921 valuation of
4 millions, the campus exclusive of
the Stadium and the Medical Center,
is now worth 18 million dollars, said
the Char.c.ellor_

A. Marshall Thompson, dean of the
School of Law, and Dr. John W. Oliv-
er, professor and head of the depart-
ment ot' history, likewise defended the
University Saturday.

E. A. Holbroolt, dean of the Schools
of E.ngineering and Mines, testified
that the University is one of the most
democratic institutions he has ever
seen. He added that he had been un-
able to recommend Dr. ’l‘urner’s liis—
tory course after making an investi-
gation of his own.

Miss Thyrsa \\'. Amos, dean of wo-
men, pointed out that time and again
freshman women had come to her.
disturbed by Dr. 'l‘urner’s rel-igious
teachings. T'he professor whose dis-

‘: missal brought on the present legis-

lative probe lacked “sensitivity to the

 University’s ideal,” she maintained.

Called to the stand Friday evening
were Charles A. Ruch, C2-36, Alan C.
Lloyd, Ed36, and Arthur Stroyd, C36,
all of whom asserted that the ousted
teacher of History I had made anti-
religious statements in and outside
the classroom.

“Religion is one of the greatest ob-
stacles to civilization,” Ruch, editor
of the Panther, quoted Dr. Turner as
having said in a conference hour. “He
did not harp on these subjects all the
time, or even a great part of the
time,” Riich added.

Stroyd substantiated Ruch’s testi-

mony, although he did not recall the-

incidents “as clearly” as had the pre-
vious witness.

“My faith increased, rather than de-
creased, under the teaching of Dr.
Turner,” stated Lloyd. “When I came
to Pitt I was a mediocre Methodist.
Then I began going to church more
often and found a whole lot more in
religion. Now one thing and another
has kept me from going to church so
often and I suppose I am again a me-
doocre Methodist.”

During Friday's. session, a letter
from Dr. Martin L, Faust, formerly in
the political science department and
at present an associate professor in
the University of Missouri, was intro-
duced by J. Alfred‘ Vvilner, attorney
for the plaintiff. Faust charged that
there was “a feeling of dread" among
the faculty here.

Controverting this declaration was
a letter from E. E. Ericson, once a
member of the English department
and -now at "the University of North

All Records Broken As 1592 Voters

Friday’s Election
Brings To P olls
50% Of Students

19321. Total 1141, Exceeded By 451;
No Irre.gula.rities Encountered
In Clean, Orderly Vote

   

l«‘ri«.la.y's election brought out by
far the largest vote in campus l1is—

to1',\;’. \\-’hen.'tlie polls closed at 4
o’(-lock, 1,592: students had cast bal-
lots.

The central polling place in Me-
morial Hall, provided with an elabor-
ate voting systein, was congested only
after the iourtli hour, and then but
3!) minutes. Despite the great num-
ber of electors, the committee of Mor-
tar Board and Ol)l'~i members under
Jules Green, C35, were able to handle
the inii-.13: without diff-iciilty.

Duplication of voting, cliallenged
ballots, and rejection of credentials———
once deemed a necessary concomitant
of undergraduaile elc-.ctions—-were no-
tably. .

At the conclusion of the ﬁrst hour
——-the polls had opened at 9:30 o'clock
——n.early 20-O votes had been cast. The
same rate of three votes per minute
was maintained until 12:30 o’clock.
From then until 1:30, more than 400
men and women went. through the
mill. and a ballot slid into the 170.’-'.
every ten seconds. The mornings
pace continued througliout the rest of
the al’te.rnoon.

According to Le-.onai'il Marks, ‘C35,
cliairman of the SFA Executive com-
mittee, the total represents approxi-
mately 50 per cent of the eligible un-
dergraduate body. Only students car-
rying 12 or more credits, it was point-
ed out, were permi'tted to take part,
and 3,200 of the entire campus regis-
tration of  signed the blue SFA
cards in February.

The 1935 record of 1.592 ballots com-
pares witli 1,228 in 1933, and 1.141 last
year. Veteran prognosticators failed
to noie that 134 petitions for assem-
bl_v nominations presaged unwonted
interest in student government. Most
predicted only 1,200 or 1.300 votes.

The vote by schools follows:

Freedom, A Reward?

NCIDENTAL to his testimon__v at the ‘third ses-
sions of the C‘a.puio connniitc-e’s inquiry into
acadeniic freedoin Dean E. A. Holbrook :m.g;gestc(l
a. definition of acadeinic freedom ”\\'lll(.‘l1 makes that
fr-ecdoin too E‘X(?ll'l.‘3l‘.'(.‘. Said he: “I, would mtg‘-
ucst that academic frccdoni l.)elo115_>'s as a riglit. to a
icaclier when he has achieved 1natur.ity in his
iicld.” U.~»itnrii_v_. Dean Holbrook said,‘  indicat-
ed by the posscssiiiiii of a full profcssorsliip.

Ac-adeinic .i'reedom, by this deﬁnition, is :1 sort of
<-vcntual right, dependent upon wlicltli-or one’s de-
part;-nent can aft'ord another full professor. Dean
ilolbrook testiiﬁcd that faciiltics of l<h1;1-i11eeri11,;'
and Mines have not been able to advance toward
ifull professorship, because of economic circum-
s.a.n-ces, during‘ the last five years. We do not be-
lieve tliat the riglit of these inen to aczulcniic free-
dom has been lgherefore deferred.

Academic freedom is a right not within the pow-
er of one individual to confer upon another. It is
more than permission to do independent rescarcli.
In a world win‘-re the problems are too numerous
for tie solutions of slicer full prot'esso1's, acacleniic
fgeedom must exist as a right for every ieaclier.

Ave, Assemlolymen
'LE’l"S give tlirre cheers and then three more for
‘ the liard_v champions of the ballot, oh.

in an election which surprised every old crack‘-
cr-barrel comnienlator on campus when 1,600 votes
were tumbled out of the ballot boxes, 29 student
assemblynicn were elected to the new Univcrsit}:
.-\sse1nbl_v. ’.l.‘he connncnl'al‘ors have not yet recov-
ered suﬁ'icicntl_v to discover Wlictlic1- or not the
clection means the renaissance of ihc Grand Old
l.’a.rty of Fratcr11it}' Cooperatives.

Probably it means that 21 platforin is still a
shaky road to success.

The Pitt News solicited programs, or platfornis,
from each 01": the candidates for ofﬁce.

Answered the man who was to 1*cce'ive the liigl1-
est vote of all senior candidates: “Skip it.”

‘And three other liighly siicccssful senior candi-

-dates answered nary a word.

Incuinbentrs who had offered: “Furllier study
of curriculum trends; enlarged systcni of campus
orientation; a m-actical campus newsrccl, and in-
.-regrsed activity pa‘:-ticipatioii"——ivcre not re-
elected.

The com_posi"te successful plaiforin ran some-
thing like this:

‘”\Vitliout sub1nittingz' a pl21tt°m'nr. I i’avo1' L\Iot.l1er
Love and Baked Ham.”

It is all very balllimg‘.

Third Sessions
S THE UNlf\'EllSl.'l.‘Y set about line methodical
job of meeting‘ the evidence of the pleiiiitiffs,
at the third sessions of the House inquiry last
week, the a.tn1os_plicro was sonieihing‘ like tliat
which used to hang over the Colisenni, on the sul-
try days when the c1npc1'ors were throwing the
t‘ln'-istians to ‘rim lions.

In this case the collcgians vxcrc ‘i'ln'o\vn to the
lawyers.

Tired of the detailed, staleinatinc testimony of
acadeniic pc1’s<:i1z‘igcs over several days, the peren-
nial audience leaned forward to enjoy the spec-
tacle of uiidergrzuluate testiinonv. 'l‘hc.ir testiilioirv
was honest and delightful. 'l‘l1e_v remeinbered
stories and accents and quotations by ilicir bettcrs.
But it was all very much like amateur night.

Certainly, if students have evidence of value to
present, tliey should appear as witnesses. It is a
point of no iinportaiice by what in was the_v ‘reach
the stand. But their natural dramatic appeal
should not be exploited for a. jaded audience in the
last act of a bacl play.

 

Interscholastics

RIDAY morning 5,000 (more or less) high

school students are coming to the campus. They
are coming at the invitation of adm.inistrative oili-
ccrs, alumni, and stuclents of the University who
believe the _ University has something to show
them. Pitt 1S following the lead of large universi-
ties and colleges throughout the country in the in-
stallation of its First Annual Interscholastics davs.

An elaborate program has been prepared for
them. But an elaborate program is insufficient to
present the University favorably to this army of
sixteen, seventeen, and eighteeiryear-olds who are
coming to discover that elusive something known
as ‘P1tt_sp1r1t.” A tap day ceremony as such will
be meaningless to them; a ﬂoat parade little more
than pretty girls on trucks, a sweepstakes, thrills

The Pitt News

and tumbles. Each of these events will take on
color and meaning to them only as the students at
the University give the blue of tlieir :support and
the gold of their interest. It is iiecessaigv for stu-
dents here to enjoy the pro,{_J:ram and turn out i'0r
the events, before our guests can enjoy it.

All students, ‘.Vl1€tl1e1' asked to be aides, or mere-
l_v reminded that hospitalit_v is in order, should
make it a point to remain on the C-znnpus Friday
and Saturday. High scliool students want to see
what makes Pitt think it ‘s good: not tapping cere-
monies, or float pa radcs. or szweepstakcs upsets.

Hear, hear, the lovely.’ golden poet, Master" P-.upert
Brooke, the handsome, burning 3:out‘n. the soul that
tender inuids pillow in their virgin dreanis, that thin-
lipped, horn—rimn1ed spectaclecl women drown in acrid
tears:

Hear, hear, this radiant Apollo sighs a thunderous sigh,
This God-man weeps green tears,
Splotches white sheets with scalding ink,

Groans over love mishandled,

Cries, “She does not care,”

Clutch-es"nis throat seared with the bitter cup,

Yanks out glowing locks—-“She loves me not.”-—
Smiles a faded smile-—"‘Ah, love has turned to kindli-

ness.”

My, my, you, too, friend Rupert?
They have wearied of your soul of souls?
Yawned at your beauty?

Come, let us laugh a little while together, beauty and
beast;

For I, too, even I with the sun stuck in my dishwater
hair, '

Struggling in vain to blind my hidden eyes, but glaring
off my nose,

Even I, glorious poet, even I have scratched with boil-
ing ink,

“But love, love had died long ago.”

But he’ll be up in the mornln’, Rupert, he'll be up in
the mornin’.

Invictus
(Written before reading; Aldous Huxley, altliough it
shouldn't have been. Adinittedly, this is sophomoric).

Standing alone in the madding crowd, 
Doubting there’s Something behind the cloud,

Jostled and crushed by the passers-by,

Glowered upon by the menacing sky,

You are the master of your fate,

Master alone of love and hate,

Master alone of life and death,

Master afraid of your very breath,

Tlmorous captain of your soul,

Groping the dark for an unknown goal.

John the sailor boy is gone.
Smile his eyes no more.
No more foamy jaunts for John
Off New England shore.

Laughing loud was John the gay,
Singing strong was he,

Till the waves rolled high one day,
And deep was the sea.

Softly sob your love, Janice,
Softly call his name:

John the sailor boy has peace;

You, my dear, have fame.

Half in a dream he was swaying-—though smoothly she

Drugged with the syrupy muslc—-—a song soon for-

Yet how reluctantly flipped in the gutter, half-tasted.

The Ideal Chorus “Girl”
Hold That Water Back

Jobs
By ROMAN LAPICA

What qualities should a Pitt Cap
and Gown chorus “Gir1" have?

McC1elland Barclay, famous artist
whose magazine pictures of girls are
known over the country, has his own
deﬁnite ideas.

In answer to a. Pitt Cap and Gown
query, Mr. Barclay telegraphed the
following qualities from New York:

1—Skln as fair as a London fog
and as tough as cowhide. saddles.

2——Rosebud mouth that purses
sweetly to emit lusty string of four-
letter words.

3--Dainty hands that pack punch
like mule.
.4-—-Legs that do quarter mile in
50 seconds flat.

5-—Add to that dash of well emu-
lated swish and shake well.

“What have you, say you?"

“The perfect male chorus girl,
say ll”

Cap and Gown’s “In the Soup” will
play an entire week at the Nixon
tl1c=.rte1' bcginiiiiig May 6.

The 43 civil, mechanical and elec-
trical c-.n_.g‘iuee1'ing‘ juniors will begin
their annual hydraulic. lab course May
27 at the University camp near Wind-
her.

The hydraulics laboratory installed
there in 1917 is worth about $15,000.

All students in liydraulics are re-
quired to complete their junior year
at Camp Hamilton.

There is no extra. charge but each
student pays for meals and 'trai:.s-
portation.

Under L. C. l\’lcCandliss, head of
the CE department, the class will
coinplete its work by June 6.

’I‘wenty-five surveyors will take
over the camp after the engineers
leave.

Former instructor in sociology
George A. Lundborg wrote. “I suffer-

Witnesses for the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People declared that the University
School of Medicine had graduated no
colored students since 1914. Dr. Ra-
leigh R_ Huggins, dean of the School,
justified the fact by noting that Pitts-
burgh hospitals provide no clinical
facilities for Negro students.

VVi1ner's request that the Univer-
sity books be opened to the public
was refused by the committee, after
C. F. C. Arensberg. Universit_v attor-
ney. had cautioned that publicity on
salaries “would be most disrupting to
the University."' The committee re-
served the right to inspect the rec-
ords in private.

Homer Wadsworth, C35, president
of the YMCA during the past year,
and Roger Hanson, C36. told the in-
vestigator-s that Dr. 'l‘urne1"s teach-

Relay Men Win
Two Third Places

Are Nosed Out. In Friday Events
At Forty-first Penn Relays

it was rather a bad day for the
Panther tracl-zmen at the Penn Relays
on Friday, In two relay events run off
on the opening day of the forty-ﬁrst
Philadelphia carnival, the Pitt run-
ners were able to gather nothing more
than third place medals.

In the distance medley event the
Panthers trailed both Michigan State
and Penn State to the ﬁnish line. Tom-
my Ottey, national cross-countr_v
champ, was the big ﬁgure in the Mich-
igan State quartet’s run of 10 min-
utes. 18.4 seconds for the two and one-
halr‘ miles. The Michiganders ﬁnished
2;. full 20 yards ahead of Penn State,
witli the Panthers coming up close be-
hind the Lions.

Three teams followed the Olsonmen,
l-'enns,vlvania, Manhattan and New
York university. Gene Venzlze, crack
zniler, was left too far behind by his
'l"c-nn mates when he started his hitch
as anchor man and could get no bet-
ter.‘ than fourth although he over-
l=:.i,uled two Inen in doing so.

ln the sprint medley relay, ‘Captain
l-"red Kiger ﬁgured in one of the great-
est. ﬁnishes of the day although he
happened to be the last man in the
"blanket ﬁnish." Hoadley, of the Uni-
versity of Z‘. aryland, broke the tape
only a stride ahead of Bill Patterson,
of Columbia. university, and Kiger was
behind by a whisker. Patterson had
;<i.artecl out with a 20-yard deﬁcit to
make up and he just managed to
breeze by Kiger in the ﬁnal few feet
in keep the Pantliers out of second
place. The winners made a. time of
'1' minutes, ?S.S seconds for thetaggre
;':::t.e mile of running.

Andy 1'.-asky was the other entrant
to write Pitt‘; name in the l<‘riday rec-
ords as he ﬁnishe-d third in the first
limit. of the 110-meter‘ high hurdles
o-vent. I.as‘.-r._v follows Gordon F_‘.vereti;,
the record holder of last vear’s Penn
llelav mark, but was eliminated from
‘iurther running inasmucli as only tlie
first two men in each heat qualiﬁed
for the ﬁnals. The event was everl-
uallv won by \\'illis IR-lard. of Michi-
gan. in a new record time of 14.5 sec-
onds.

 

Dukes Come Over
To Play Ball In
, Pitfs Back Yard

Pitt meets Duouesne on the grid-
iron and nobody goes to the game!

Something a bit wrong here. But
('-'~.’e1‘}'tllillg‘ is explained by the fact
Hi:-it it was only a practice game.
played at the Panther practice ﬁeld
Thursday.

Coach Jlock Sutherland invited,
(‘oach Christy Flanagan and his‘
(‘llLll‘gF.‘.S to come up on the hill for a
hit of a worl<‘.out and the Dukes accept-
ml the offer. A regulation game, of
:appro.\:imate.l_'v’ ltl-minute quarters. was
the feature of the program at the little
party.

Coaches were permitted to walk up
and down the ﬁeld with their teams
:'!l(l there was no limit on substitu-
tions. The boys were instructed to
IOSS the ball away once they got loose
:'or a. touchdown and on several occa-
sions the subs, managers, et al were

the shirt that studied anatomy!

The Arrow MITOGA owes its success in life to
the fact that it is based on a study of the mas-

culine ﬁgure.

Its shoulders curve the way your shoulders do
. . . its sleeves taper with the arms . . . and its
waist is cut in just as are the waists of the great
majority of American males.

The result is a better-ﬁtting, better-looking

shirt than most men have ever been privileged.
to wear! And MITOGA keeps its superior ﬁt be-
cause it is Szmforizecl-Sbrzm.k———the old bugaboo
of shrinkage can play no tricks with the size.

a variety of smart colors, patterns and models.

Little, Harlowe Will Be Guest
Speakers At Annual Affair

High school football players and
coaches will gather at the stadium
Saturday, May 11, for the University's
fourth annual football clinic, which
will be held under the. direction of Dr.
John B. Sutherland, varsity football
coach.

Invitations have been extended to
players and coaches in schools in
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Vvest Virginia,
New Jersey and New York.

Prac..ic.ally every phase of football
will be covered at the clinic with
special attention being given to block-
ing, charging, punting, passing and
tackling. The Pitt football team will
demonstrate the various phases of the
game, which will be discussed.

Guest speakers at the clinic will be
Lou Little, coach at Columbia, and
Dick I-larlowe of Harvard. Little has
developed such stars as Al B-arabas
and Cliff Montgoinery, who led the
Columbia team to its victory over
Stanford in the Rose Bowl game two
years ago. Harlowe. who was recent-
ly appointed football coach at Har-
vard, previously coached at ‘Western
Maryland. where he was highly suc-
cessful. One of his best products was
Bill Shepherd, who last fall was the
nation’s leading scorer. I-larvard grid
fans arecounting upon him to lead
the Crin‘.:3on out of the football de-
pression into which it has fallen in
recent years.

The coaches who will assist Dr.
Sutherland in conducting the demon-
strat.io..s of how the individual po-
sitions should be played are the fol-
lowing: Bill Kern in charge of the
tackles, Ecltlie Hi1'sl1be1‘gc1‘, ends, Mike
llilligaii, guards, Ray Daugherty, cen-
ters. and How( y O’Dell, Eddie Baker

International Attitude
Of U. S. Bureau Stressed

A, C. Carpenter, of the United
States department of foreign and do-
mestic commerce, stressed the depart-
ment's attitude to the effect that “no
nation is self-contained” before a
meeting of Pitt Business Institute Fri-
day.

"Without international trade,” he
said, “unit prices would soar and pro-
duction. would drop, The United
States at present maintains a. favora-
ble balance of trade. Wle export more
to the European countries than they
do to us, and we export less to the
Asiatic countries tha’n they do to us.”
