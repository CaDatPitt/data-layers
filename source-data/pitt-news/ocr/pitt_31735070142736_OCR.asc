ACLU hears
speakers,
stories at Pitt

John Manganaro
For The Pitt News

The Frick Fine Arts Building echoed
with stories last night as Oakland
residents gathered to discuss the past
years biggest American Civil Liberties
Union cases.

About 120 people attended the.

ACLU’s armual presentation of “Voic—
es of Freedom: The Personal Side of
Civil Liberties.”

Hosted by the Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter ofthe ACLU, anational advo-
cacy group for individual rights, the
event featured seven speakers who
shared experiences of standing up
for constitutional rights in Oakland
and Western Pennsylvania.

Witold Walczak, the legal director
ofthe Pennsylvania ACLU who hosted
the event, said organizers hoped they
could put aface on some of the broad
legal issues currently under debate
in the Pittsburgh area — including
G-20 Summit arrests, gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender rights and
religious freedom.

“The workwe do often appears to
be about only abstract legal issues,”
Walczak said. “But most ﬁmdamen-
tally it’s about the people involved —
young women, students, local com-
munity members. It’s about making

» rightwhat the government has made

wrong in these people’s lives.”

Nancyjankowiak, one Pittsburgh
resident in attendance, explained
what drew her to the event.

SGB voices concerns about The Pitt News

Erin Block
Staff‘ Writer

As this year’s Student Government Board term
comes to aclose, Board members voice concerns
about The Pitt News. ‘

SGB spent more than 10 minutes of its meet-
ing last night, which lasted half an hour, sharing
criticism of The Pitt News, especially involving
“G-20 resolutions and [SGB’s] overall response,
aswellas our revision ofthe bylaws,” Board mem-
ber Max Greenwald said.

The Pitt News’s ads were also atopic of Green-
wald’s statement.

He said it is “criminal” for The Pitt News to
force student organizations to spend what he
said were “outrageous” amounts of money on
advertisements, some of which SGB funds for
the groups.

For student groups, which receive a dis-
counted advertising rate, Pitt News ads range
from $18 to $508, which is for a ﬁill-page ad.
Each individual student also receives ﬁve free’
classiﬁed ads per term.

Greenwald also said the content in The Pitt
News is “a disgrace.” -

“Students don’t care about columnists’ opin-
ion on malt liquor and40s,” he said, referencinga

recent colunm in the papers opinions section. ,

Greenwald referenced the fact that the
University provides The Pitt News space in the
Union.

“If my termwas notcorningtoaclose, Iwould
do everything in my power to remove such a

‘ foolish institution from the students’ building,”

he said. _ _

_ Apart from space in the Union, the paper is
ﬁnancially independentfrom University funding
and voluntarily receives no allocations money
directly from SGB.

Pitt News editor in chief Drew Singer said
Greenwald’s discontent was news to him.

“Like any Pitt News reader, Max Greenwald
is morethanwelcometo contact me to share his
thoughts about our coverage. Despite having my
cell phone number, he regrettablyhas never once
done so,” Singerwrote in an e-mail. “The column
to which Greenwald refers was among our most
popular on pittnews.com that day, which exem-
pliﬁes our effortto offeradiverse range of content

that appeals to all varieties of readers.”

Singer also addressed the paper’s office space
in the Union.

“The Pitt News receives space in the student
union because it’s a student organization,” he
said. .

Greenwald also said that he attributes the low
number of candidates running for SGB to the
“lack of interest,” adding that few students are
interested intaking on leadership roles in some
of Pitt’s “strongest organizations.” _

SGB President Kevin Morrison agreed with
Greenwald’s statement about low number of
candidates running for'SGB, saying there is a
“general apathy  the student body.”

He also said that The Pitt News’ editorial»

boardislacking. ~

“I am not pointing at writers and reporters.
I believe organizations are a reﬂection of their
leadership,” Morrison said. ‘ ,_

Morrison said The Pitt News faﬂedto get a
“point-counter—point” when covering recent

A SGB—related ar1icles.

The remainder of the meeting included the

introduction of a new student group.

~ Marc Schutzbank, a spokesman for a new
organization called Plant to Plate, announced
an event at the meeting.

The organization, an affiliate ofHillel]ewish
University Center,willhold its ﬁrst eventtomor-
row ﬁom noonto4p.m. ’

_ Schutzbank said the groupwilluse apiece of
land at5721 Forbes Ave. to start an organic garden‘
where students can grow their own food.

He said the organization wants to show stu-
dents where theirfood comes from and howthey
cancook it. Tomorrow’s eventwillinvolve pulling
weeds to kick off the garden’s debut._ .

The organization will also promote the use
of compost on campus.

“You’ll never have to throw anything away
again,” Schutzbank said.

Oakland Community Council’s new director,

Emma Stoehr, discussed the rising increase in ’

criminal activities including robbery and as-
saults in Oakland, with Board member Alexa
Jennings.

Jennings said the director wants to start a

students, especially in South Oakland, to par-
ticipate. , V

Citizens condemned some police actions duringthe
G-20 Summit at the Citizen Police Review Board
meetinglast night. - r

A mix of Pitt students and members of the
community packed into a room at the Commu-
nity of Reconciliation Church on North Belleﬁeld
Avenue. ;

At 6 p.rn., the microphone went to several
speakers who signed up beforehand From 6:30

to 8 p.m., anyone in the crowd of about75 people a

could volunteer to speak. All of the speakers re-
ﬂected negatively on police conduct during the
Summit ~ ' ‘

Many of tire speakers said they felt conﬁised
about directions given by police and police action
taken without warning. Others said theyspent
hours outside after. their arrest before being re-
leased.

David Tessitor said that he was in Oakland on I

Friday night and sawthe police as “out of order.”

He said he  the police departmentwould
not learn from what happened during the Surn-
rnit. .

“Our police can do better, they need to do bet-
ter,”Tessitor said. - _

Several students who spoke wore signs with
the acronym “WHAP,” which stands for “What
Happened At Pi ” The organization is a protest
group that formed after the police action during
the Summit, member Matthew Lynas said.

Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey attended
the meeting. She said shewantedtohearwhatPitt
students had to say and that she felt concerned
about the situation.

’ Citizen Police ReviewBoardDirectorElrzabeth'
Pittinger said the board received 77 complaints
of alleged police misconductirelatingto the Sum-
mit. '

Theboardwillmost likely holdaanother public
hearing on the police conduct during the Summit
some time after theboard meets again in Decem-
ber, Pittinger said.

Pittinger encouraged people who still wished
to ﬁle complaints to do so.

the ACLU members and their clients,”Jankowiak
said. “These people have been ﬁghtingthis ﬁght
for much of their lives. It’s inspiring to see.”

Barb Feige, director of the Pennsylvania
ACLU Pittsburgh Chapter, described the event
as avital component of her organization’s yearly
work.

“I think we sometimes get caught up in the

._ big picture view of what free speech and other

constitutional rights mean,” Feige said of ACLU
operations. “But when you get to see an actual
person who has ﬁrm beliefs, and you see how
committed that person is, you can understand
the issue in a deeper, more personal way.”

Feige and_ other ACLU members hoped the
stories would touch people onan emotional level
— a level different from readingthe newspaper
or surﬁng the Internet.

Feige said the Pittsburgh Chapter of the ACLU .

selected speakers for the event in a variety of
ways. Some speakers volunteered, while others
were asked to speakbythe organization. I

One speaker, Pitt freshman Tracey Hickey,
described her arrest on the night of Sept. 25
and the ways she thoughtpolice forces infringed
upon her constitutionalrights.

“I was holdingthe door open for people run-
ning into Towerswhen police came up onto the

“patio,” Hickey said of her arrest. “They clearly

wanted everyone off the patio, so as far as Iwas
concerned, the police wanted people to go inside.
There was nowhere else to go.” I

_ An ofﬁcer arrested Hickey as police ap-

proached the Towers Lobby. Later that night,

the arresting ofﬁcer formally charged Hickey
with failure to- disperse.

Hickey explained that she decided to speak
at the meeting for two reasons.

“The ACLU has been abig help to me in deal-

ing with all of my court dates and procedures,” —
Hickey said. “I wanted to help them out any _

way that I could. So when a woman from the
ACLU called and asked if I would share my story,
I agreed immediately.”

The other reason she decided to speak,
Hickey said, was more personal.

“I want to get my story out there,” Hickey
said. “I feel like there is this stereotypeof stu-
dents who got arrested.”

0 U l8tr, texting while driving

exting while drivinghas g2g.
The state House Transpor-
tation Committee voted unani-
mously yesterday to send House Bill
2070 for approval fromthe House of
Representatives. The bill would ban
drivers from texting on cell phones,
PDAs and laptops, according to the
Pittsburgh Tribune—Review. In truth,
such a restriction seems long over-
due. '
In some states, such as New York,
Newjersey and California, it’s illegal to

talk on your cell phone while driving

without using a headset or putting the

' phone on speaker. Comparedtotalking,

textingisn’t onthe same level of distrac-
tion—it’sworse.Allthe reading, typing
and_ﬁimblingforthe“sen ”key—such

_ multitaskingisn’tintheleastconducive

to safe driving.

There are unparalleled, well-docu-
mented dangers associatedwithtatting
while driving. In a Virginia Tech study
released injuly, researchers found that
drivers who were textingwere up to 23

times more likely to be involved in a 5

crash orcome closetoanaccidentcom-
pared to non-distracted drivers. While
convincing, the real effect should be
obvious: Taking your eyes off the road
is dangerous, plain and simple.

The oppositionwillpointtotexting
as just one of the limitless range of dis-
tracters behind the wheel. They fear
the imposition of“nanny government”
restrictions. Yes, there are numerous
other distracters while driving: the
rushed young businesswoman who
struggles to apply her makeup while

trying to keep her hands on the wheel,
while the ﬂedgling teen driver tests
out the max volume of his car’s new
stereo system. Such distractions are
also legitimate dangers, but texting’s
ubiquity and prevalence make punish-
ment warrantable. ,

As it stands, the bill says that vio-
lators will pay a $50 ﬁne for texting.
This seems a reasonable ﬁgure, but if
violations persist, the ﬁne should be
raised. People have to take this issue
seriously.

From an age before most even be-
gin drinkingor driving, society makes
sure to ﬁrmly entrench the dangers of
combiningthe two. But lefsberealistic.
Texting is scoffed at more frequently
for instilling egregious’ grammar on
youngteens and constantly stealingat-

tention from the teacher atthe ﬁ'ont of
the classroom. But should we see sucha
seemingly harmless activityas athreat?
Textinghasbeen aroundfor morethan
just a few years now. We should have
seen it long ago. _
PartofBill 2070 also prohibits driv-
ers with learner’s permits from using
cell phones or other electronic devices
behind the wheel — another very rea-
sonable measure. Part of learning to
drive involves learning about the dan-
gers of driving. It would seem contra-
dictory—orintheleast, ironic —to

. allownewdriverstogetacquaintedwith

such dangers.

apathy has repercussions

reported.

The SGB election might not sound
important, but SGB controls asigniﬁ-
cant amount of money on this campus
that dictates which student activities

occur. Each undergraduate student

at the Pitt pays a $160 activities fee
each year, and SGB is responsible for
disbursing more than halfof it.

Associate‘ Director for Student
Life Terry Milani said that of the
$2,429,238 expected to be collected
from the $160 student activities fee
in this academic year, SGB controls
the allocation of $1,276,715 meant to
support student organizations on cam-
pus. The rést of the activities fee goes
to support the'Pitt Program Council,
WPTS, Telefact and studentvolunteer
outreach programs, etc.

importantly, SGB’s control of more

than half the money collected from '

the student activities fee gives them
the power to shape student events on
campus" and either destroy or grow
student organizations.

But SGB’s power extends beyond

spending student money. SGB also

appoints students to University com-
mittees, actas representatives for stu-
dents to City politicians and lobbies
for new policies and initiatives like the
one-day fall break.
Because SGB is the “Student Gov-
ernment Board,” it is understood to

officially represent Pitt students within
and outside of our campus commu-
nity-

Because SGB has so much power
over student life at Pitt and because
it is expected to represent us to the
administration‘ and city ofﬁcials,~it is
importantthat SGB be truly represen-
tative. But even when there is com-
petition for SGB offices, only a minor
percentage of students participate in
SGB elections.

For instance, last year’s SGB elec-
tions saw a four-way race for SGB
president with intense campaigning
on the part of all the candidates who
actively sought student organization

endorsements in the run-up to theﬁnal -

vote. In spite of the heated race, only
3,876 students —— roughlyzo percent
of eligible voters —votedforpresident
in last year’s election, The Pitt News
reported. '

20 percent voter participation
hardly validates SGB as a governing
body representative ofundergraduate
students at the Pitt, but at least last
year’s election involved competition.
This year, withthe nine SGB positions
currently uncontested, the deadline to
ﬁleforSGB candidacywas extendedto
today at noon, but, as of press time,
no additional students have entered
the race.

Late candidates are required to

submit 400 signatures, a 500-word
essay and a $100 deposit in order to
get on the ballot, but meeting these
requirements doesn’t guarantee alate
candidate could enter the election.
SGB president Kevin Morrison said
that the elections committee has to
meet and approve any late candidate
before today at noon and, although

they’ve been told to keep their sched— .

ules open, there is no guarantee that
the elections committee would ap-
prove a candidate who met all these
requirements in time.

With no late candidates having
emerged so far, the SGB election on
Nov. 17 promises to be a non-event
where the few students that do par-
ticipate are simply rubberstarnping a
broken process.

If a few late candidates don’t
emerge by the noon deadline today,
SGB would be wiseto amend the pro-
cess and postpone the election by a
week or more until more candidates
step forward. A non—competitive
election would not only be silly, but
would tarnish the legitimacy of an
already-questionable student body
that controls a- signiﬁcant amount of
student ﬁmds.

Flyleaf remains humble, despite platinum success

Its new album, Merzimto Mari,
dropped on Tuesday and thisweek it’ll
be makingastop at Mr. Small’s on tour.
Welcome to Pittsburgh, Flyleaf.

Flyleaf began playing alternative
rock inTexas as atwo—member band,
according to bass player Pat Seals.

Since 2000, the band has expand-

. ed, toured, released two albums and .

beenvotedasBestArlistand BestBand
byMI‘Vandtl1e public onYahoo! Polls,
respectively.

- Despite the fact that its ﬁrst, self-
titled album went platinum, selling
more than 1 million copies in the

United States, its goal remains fairly ‘

humble.

“Flyleaf’s mission is deﬁnitely to
use our music and personas/careers as
a platfonn to convey whathas changed
our lives,” Seals wrote in an e-mail in-
terview.

“Our band would not exist today
the way it does without the many
people from home who believed in/
helped us,” Seals wrote. “We hadare-
ally wonderﬁil base of support from

our friends and families, with [guitar 4

tingus use both oftheirvehiclesto get
ourselves and equipmentto shows for
just about two years. My folks allowed
me to drop out of college and crash at
home while Flyleafwas betwixt show-
cases and recordings.

“Also, a cadre of other local bands
in the Belton/Temple, Austin, Dal-
las and Houston areas provided us a
‘scene’ in which to exist and gather
inﬂuences,” he wrote. \

Music compositioncanbe diflicult,
but Flyleaf can make even the diffi-
culty of combining many different and
musical tastes work somehow work

“We have a pretty functional sys- -

tem in Flyleaf so far, so it’s only about
as hard for us to write a songwe feel
good about as it is to mow a medium-
sized lawn with a push—mower, but
in April or so when it is not too hot
outside,” Seals wrote. ’

Topic-wise, the band’s lyrics lean
toward the dark and emotional.

“Frequent themes for me are
dissatisfaction and longing,” Seals
wrote. .

“I’m no brilliant or proliﬁc writer,
butwhenlmanage to write something
I feel good about, it seems to be the
result of many ideas I’ve 'c_ulled by
happenstance in a pedestrian man-
ner that have been ‘put into my brain
blender,’ so to speak, and then ‘poured
into my song cup’ for others to enjoy
 or ignore.”

“I feel great about Memento Man’ as
far as quality — I also have very high

hopes for it,” he wrote. “I feel that [Me-

._ manta M072] is a big step forward for

us musically and sonically. When our
self-titled was released in 2005, I had
no ideawhatto expect orifitwouldbe
successful at all.”

_ Withthe release of Memento Mon‘
and a tour to complete, the band’s
life is surprisingly quiet, according to
Seals. Occasionally a prank is pulled
or a ﬁiend is seen at a show.

“Exp1oringc1_'eepy/hauntedvenues
is ﬁm, and seeing the sights of places
we haven’t been before is always a
blast,” Seals wrote.

The band continues to set up con-
certs for its tours, but Seals admits
things could change if something un-
foreseen happens. .

“We can’tpredicttheﬁ1ture — our
careers could easily peter out in a few
months,” he wrote. “We of course
hope to keep doing this, but we- are
very happy to have what we have at
this moment in time. If Flyleaf was

Keep the fashion, leave the celebrity

Sam Stahl
Columnist

I have a beef with something. It tirelessly weighs
on my mental well-being day—in and day-out. I
continuallywake up in the middle of the night, so
burdened am I with annoyance at the issue.

The problem? Celebrity fashion lines.

It seems as though every gal in Hollywood
with a pint of success has slapped her name on
a clothing line. Ifthese desperate attempts at
consumerist acceptance aren’t a case study in
narcissism, I don’t know what is. It’s no secret
that celebs have serious entitlement issues, but
Ijusthaveto ask: Whytakeitthisfar?.

Not maldngaprettypenny offyourlastﬂop-
laden album, eh? So you thought you could pin
your name to a line ofpo1yester—blend atrocities
and call it a day? That’s what you thought? Well
ﬁnd another route to proﬁt, has—been D—listers,

I because I’m sick and tired ofhearing about your

attempts atﬁashion superstardom. This isn’thigh
school sewing class — you actually need to pos-
sess talentto launchaline. ._

Celebrity brands range lromthe good and the
badto the just plain ﬁigly. Heidi Montag-Pratt (if

she caneven be consideredacelebrity),tha1:latter ,

descriptivewasforyou. Your collaborationwith
juniorbudget retailerAnchorBluewas atrocious.
Who exactly did you think was going to wear
acrylic hotpants orzebraprintdressesthelength

. of a camisole? Oh right, you would.

Lindsay Lohan’s saunter into the leggings
industry can best be explained as an act of self-
beneﬁcence. Aﬂzer all, we wouldn’t want her to
runaroundbottomless, nowwouldwe? Ohwait,
we’re too late. Luckily, she’s also started her own
self—tanner company, so when she does forget
to put pants on before leavingthe house her legs
aren’t a ghastly shade of paste.

Lauren Conrad provided us with enough
abysmally simple jersey dresses to lastalifetime.
No surprise that the overpriced line ended up
crashing. = -

There are, of course, exceptions. To the Olsen

twins, thankyoufor continually givingme $200
T—shirts to lust over with your lines Elizabeth
and James and The Row.‘ If it weren’t for your
pricey pieces, I might have long since dropped
out of college and joined the circus. But a click
through your fall collections gently reminds
me, “Sam, you need to  a living someday.
Those feather—t1°imm'ed blazers aren’t going to
pay for themselves. So stop scrolling through
the backlogs of textsﬁ'omlastnight.com7 and get
towork.Adiplomaissupposedto meanapaying

' job someday, right?

Then there are exceptions within lines that
are otherwise deemed a disaster. For example, my
roommate Erikatrotted homefroma particularly
exhilarating trip to Walmart afew weeks ago and
exclaimed, “Youwillnot believe whati bought!”

Withthat, she procured from her smiley face- 7

branded shopping bag a surprisingly adorable

screen-printed T-shirt dress. The designer, you -

ask? Miley Cyrus with Max Azria. Trust me, no
onewas more shockedthanme. I
Gwen Stefani’s L.A.M.B. brand continually
delivers charming punk-preppy separates. Ni-
cole Richie’s House of Harlow accessories line
boded surprisingly well among fashion critics.
Thenthere’s my personal guiltypleasure,Jessica
Simpson’s shoe collection. Ilove the girl’s footwear
so much thatl own two pairs of her ﬂats.
A friend and I_ were wandering around a
department store over the summer and — no
lie — every time I  a pair of shoes enough
to pick them up and look at the tag, they were
Jessica Simpson. A little embarrassing, butI ig-
nored the brand and bought them anyway. My
ﬁiend, on the other hand, insisted she would
never purchase  with ‘Simpson’s name
on it on pure principle. ~ I ..
For me, theJS line worked because I genuinely
likedthe merchandise. Butthevery sellingpoint
"Simpson’s  banked onto moveproduct
issimultaneously its greatest downfall. If‘fIessica
Simpson” hadn’tbeen stamped into the sole, my
friend might have picked up a pair, too. i A
Do retailers really think that collaborating
with a D—list celebrity is going to stimulate the
credit card-wielding masses?Iknowthe economy

is ﬂagging and all, but there are better ways to

increase proﬁts. For starters, trymakingclothes
that are actually attractive.
To the celebs, all I’m saying is stick to your

A Wannstedt vs. Weis showdown

Four years after their coaching debuts, Dave Wannstedt and Charlie Weis prepare to face-off yet again

Lucas Felak I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Quarterback Bill Stull will face Notre Dame this Saturday.

 

Kyle Craig
Senior Staff Writer

Wannstedt and Weis

Four years ago, Dave Wannstedt
and Charlie Weis made their respec-
tive collegiate head coaching debuts.

' The Fighting Irish drubbed the Pan-

thers 42-21, and the two teams went
in opposite directions from there.

On Saturday, the two coaches will
meet again, and it appears like the
teams are on divergent paths once
more. But this time, No. 12 Pitt is on
the rise, and the Fighting Irish are
struggling.

During his Monday afternoon
press conference, reporters asked
Wannstedt what the major difference
was between his program now and
when he ﬁrst took over ﬁve seasons
ago.
“We’ve got better depth now,” he
said. “We thought we were a heck of
a lot better than we really were [in
2005]. We found out really quickthat
we had work to do.”

So far, the Panthers have gone 33- .

24 under Wannstedt. Notre Dame has
a similar record of 35-24 with Weis as
the head coach. '

Yet, despite the comparable
overall records, distinctly different
sentiments swirl around the two
programs.

Wannstedt has Pitt 8-1 forthe ﬁrst
time since 1982, when Dan Marino
was tossing the ball around Pitt Sta-
dium.

Things aren’t so great for Weis,
after losing to Navy for the second-«
straight time at home, Notre Dame
is 6-3 and the temperature of Weis’
seat is growing.

Taking that into consideration,
Saturday’s game becomes even more
signiﬁcant. Warmstedt will look for
a victory in order to push his team
further onto the national stage, while
Weis will be attempting to save his
own job.

Amid the success and attention,
Wannstedt is remaining grounded
considering the three difﬁcult con-E‘
tests ahead of the Panthers.

Pittsburgh prepares to ‘Turn It Blue’

Diana Connor I SENIORSTAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Fans cheer during Pitt’s Homecoming game against the University of
South Florida.

 

jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

In anticipation of Pitt’s upcom-
ing matchup against Notre Dame,
Pittsburgh mayor Luke Raven-
stahl declared Friday “Turn it
Blue Day” in Pittsburgh.

The Panthers,’ ranked No. 8
by the Associated Press and No.
12 in the BCS standings, will host
the Fighting Irish in a primetime
game to be broadcast on ABC.
Kickoff for the game is set for 8
p.m. on Saturday. The Panthers’
8-1 start to the season is their
best since 1982 when quarter-
back Dan Marino led a team that
also started 8-1.

Before Pitt’s Homecoming
game against South Florida Oct.
24, Pitt’s athletic department
used a similar “Turn it Blue” pro-
motion as a sign of school spirit.

C Like the athletic department’s

promotion, fans are encouraged
to wear Pitt blue on Friday and
also wear their blue to Heinz
Field on Saturday.

Considering the mayor’s cam-
paign to get the city excited about
Pitt football, the team has high
expectations for fan support Sat-
urday night.

“The city of Pittsburgh loves
its football, and we are looking
forward to a great crowd Saturday
night when we play N otre Dame,”
Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt said.
“I know our city’s Pitt pride will
be on display throughout the
weekend as we play one of our
biggest games of the year.”

Following the Notre Dame
game, Pitt will have its second
bye week of the season. Its next
game will be against rival West
Virginia in Morgantown on Nov.
27.

The Pitt women’s basketball team .
used a 17-0 ﬁrst-halfrun to pull away
from Seton Hill and eventually defeat
the Grifﬁns 91-60 last night. The ex-
hibition game. marked point guard
Jania Sims’s first game since suffering
a season-ending injury last season.

The junior scored 14 points and A
dished out eight assists for the Pan-
thers in her retum.

“I was really, really excited,” Sims
said. “Coach [Agnus Berenato] told me
to just calm down and play my game.
It felt good to be back in the uniform :
and run up and down the court.”

Berenato amomfirst

Basketball 4 7

Junior Shayla Scott said Sims’s return helps
the rest of the Panthers to feel comfortable on
the court because, although players stepped up
to ﬁll the position last season, Sims is a natural
point guard. .

“It makes you feel relaxed to be able to play
with her, because if we’re ﬂustered or need to take
adeep breath, we can look at her and knowthat
that’s her job and that’s her role,” Scott said.

The Panthers fell behind by as many as nine
points in_tl1e ﬁrsthalfbefore Scott ignited aﬂurry
of Pitt scoring with a baseline jumper.

Kate Popovec followed with a lay—up and was
fouled. Taneisha Harrison grabbed the rebound
off the missed foul shot and scored to shrink the
Seton Hill lead to 34-32.

Shortly after, Scott gave Pitt the lead for good-

with a 3—pointer and the Panthers eventually
built a 47-37 lead that they took. into the half.

Scott led all scorers with 20 points and col-
lected eight rebounds.

“At the four—minute timeout, I said to the
team, ‘We need to crackthis open and go into the
locker room leading by 10,” Berenato said.

Seton Hill shot 60 percent from beyond the
arc in the ﬁrst half, with leading scorerjordan
Burkes and Katie Lintner each perfect from the
3-point line. Burkes ﬁnished the game with 17

- points for the Grifﬁns.

Berenato said the Panthers had had difﬁ-
culty hitting the shots in the ﬁrst half, but that
she’s conﬁdent the team will make those shots
in the ﬁxture.

 

     

The Panthers started the second half as
strongly as they ended the ﬁrst: with a 24-5 run
that sealed the victory.

Pitt improved its 3-point defense in the sec—I
0nd half, limiting the Grifﬁns to 1-for-7 shoot-
ing from beyond the arc. Seton Hill’s ﬁeld goal
percentage also dropped signiﬁcantly bythe end
of the game, falling from close to 47 percent to
28 percent during the second half.

' Pitt held a distinct advantage underneath the
rim throughout the game, grabbing48 rebounds
-— including 23 offensive —— to Seton Hill’s 29.
Popovec ﬁnished with 10 rebounds and nine
points, and center Selenda'Nwude grabbed nine
rebounds and scored eight points. I '

The Panthers took advantage of 19 Seton Hill
mishaps and scored24 points off uimovers. Pitt
allowed 10 turnovers, and Berenato said shewas
pleased with the Panthers’ ability to protect the
ball throughout the game. .

“In the second half, we showed that we could
dominate,” she said. “All in all, it was the ﬁrst
game, and at least we know where we stand. We
have a lot of work to do, and it makes it exciting
to go back to practice.”

Berenato’s daughter, Clare Berenato — who
plays for Seton Hill —-~ scored the ﬁrst basket of
her college career during the game.

“I’m really, really proud of her,” Berenato

' said. “I’m amom ﬁrst. Ifthey had not been play-

ing us, Iwouldn’t have gotten to see that. I can’t
emphasize how proud I was.”

“[The rankings are] a neat thing for our
program. It’s not going to help us win this Sat-
urday against Notre Dame,” Wannstedt said.

Efficient Arms

Saturday’s contestwill match two of the most
efficient quarterbacks in college football.

Pitt quarterback Bill Stullwill enter the game
rankedﬁfth nationally inpassing efficiency with
a 161.6 rating. Onthe other sideline, Irish signal
callerjimmy Clausen is the nation’s third—rated
passer with a 162.9 rating.

A side—by-side comparison of the statistics

9

Battle of quarterbacks

heavily favors Clausen, in part because of Notre 4
Dame’s pass—happy offense.

Through nine games, Clausen has completed -
209 passes for2,770 yards and 20 touchdowns.
Stul_l has completed 148 passes for 1,879 yards
and 17 scores.

Both quarterbacks have been successful, 1*
however. Consider that Clausen has completed
only 10 fewer passes than Stull has even at-
tempted (219). C1ausen’s 308 pass attempts are
evidence of the Irish philosophy of throwing
the football. '

Clausen’s numbers certainly have one per-
son’s attention — Dave Wannstedt.

“I thinkjimmy Clausen is playing as good as
any quarterback around; He’s much improved
in all aspects of the game,” he said.

It’s safe to assume that Clausen will try to
exploit a Pitt secondary that was picked on
earlier in the season. ’“*

The Panthers gave up 433 receiving yards
against Buffalo and 322 receiving yards intheir
loss to North Carolina State.

Still, Wannstedt believes the secondary has
made strides and is playing better than it was
earlier in the year. ,

“I know we’ve got better,” he said. “We’ve
settled in a bit more as the year has gone on,
defensively. I think our players have a little bit
more conﬁdence. [Notre Dame] will be a real
test.”
