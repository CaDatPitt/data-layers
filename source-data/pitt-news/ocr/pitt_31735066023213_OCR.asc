Board of Trustees Give Go Ahead to Activities Fee Hike .

1. By TERESA SOKOL
Pitt News Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Board of Trustees, at yesterday’s
meeting in Forbes Quadrangle, ac-
cepted ‘an increased student ac-
tivities fee and "directed the ad-
ministration to re-examine a newly
revised visitation policy at the end
of the spring term. i ,

Judge Ruggero Aldisert, trustee
and head of the Student Affairs
Committee, read the Student
Government Board request that ._the
student activities fee be raised from
$12 to $24 per term for full-time
students and from $4 to $8 a term
for part-time students.

Aldisert said that it _is traditional-
ly up to the board to adopt such an

increase, but that the proposal must
first originate from‘ students.

This 100 percent increase in ac-
tivities fee is an attempt to keep up

,with inﬂation and to improve the

quality of student programs on
campus, Aldisert said. .

The motion to approve the in-
crease was carried unanimously by.
the Board.

Aldisert also reported on the stu-
dent visitation policy which he said
had “provoked much interest and
national publicity.” .

The Student Affairs Committee
had met earlier that day with ap-
proximately 75-100 concerned stu-
dents in a closed session, Aldisert
said.

Financial Difficulty is  
Closes Night Times

By JEFF COUCH
- NewsEditor

Financial difficulties have forced
the School of General Studies
Student Cabinet Council to tem-
porarily discontinue publication of
the Night Times (the SGS student
newspaper) pending the ﬁndings of
a review committee, according to
Dave Huffner, council president.

A statement released by the

ouncil said the newspaper’s
ﬁnancial difficulties are due to,
funding problems, inadequate ﬁs-
cal management and difficulties in
production.

Because of an approximately 11
percent decrease in available
student activities fee revenue, the
Night Times, like other SGS
student organizations, received a
budget cut for the current ﬁscal
year, according to Huffner.

' The council was lead to believe
(by the newspaper’s management)
that the «funds allocated to the

._ paper would sufficiently cover

publication costs for the current
academic year, Huffner added.

Former Night Times editor
William Means, who resigned his
position at the newspaper to run for
council, disagreed, saying he had
warned the council numerous times
that the publication needed more
funding. ' ‘ -\

Since there are no ofﬁcial records
of the warnings, Means said the
council denies that such warnings
were made.

Means denies that the paper
suffered from poor ﬁscal manage-
ment.

“We pulled in more ad revenue
this year, especially on the national
level,” hé\sa_id. “It is unfair to say
we have been poorly-managed.”

Night Times assistant editor»

Kimberly Powell saitfthe council

has the resources‘ to rescue the
-newspaper from its ﬁscal prob-
lems—problems that were beyond
the newspaper’s control.

“When Will (Means) resigned,

~ we did not know the seriousness of

the ﬁnancial situation,” she said.

Part of the problem was due to a
succession of secretaries who
shirked their responsibility in
handling the paying of the Night
Times’ bills, allowing production
bills to remain unpaid, Powell said.

The special review committee,
according to Huffner, is charged

’with producing a plan for the

newspaper’s publication, ‘which
should be approved before March
3, 1980. . _

The responsibilities of the review

committee include:

—Determining “the purpose and
mission of the publication,”

,—-Studying if .the newspaper
should be autonomous (i.e. whe-
ther the newspaper’s purse strings
should no longer be controlled by
council);

-—Determining"if an advisor is
needed, _

—-Recontmendling “the, most
suitable format for ~ publication,’ ’

—Determining the feasibility of H

purchasing used typesetting equip-

’ment‘from the Pitt News,
-Establishing a charter or

similar operating documents and
—Report its deliberations to the

- council. -

Huffner hopes to begin publica-
tion of the Night Times later this
term after the ﬁndings of the
committee are released.

“We are trying to make it a
publication that would encourage
the involvement of SGS stu-
dents...,” Huffner.added. '_ 3"

 

 

were given a newly revised visitation
policy allowing for opposite sex?
visitation on weekends, according
to Aldisert. The new policy also
allows opposite sex members of a
resident's immediate family to stay
overnight, he added. '

These changes are part of an on-
going and formulating policy on the
part of the administration to

achievesecurity while vindicating
the rights of privacy of residents,
said Aldisert.‘ _

The proposed student visitation
policy “does not come with the en-
dorsement of the student
body...students have serious pro-
blems with it,” Aldisert said. _

However, several Board members
stated that the new policy would

strengthen security measures at the

residence halls, and‘ suggested that
the program be implemented in its
newly revised form, and then
reviewed at the end of the spring.
term, as to the procedure’s effec-
tiveness. -

The new visitation policy is
scheduled to gointo effect for the
spring term, 1980.

* By‘B0B WARMKESSEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt administrators have revised
the new visitation policy that they
approved less than two weeks ago.
One of the major revisions would
allow students to host overnight
guests of ‘the opposite sex on
weekends.

The revised policy (see page 3)
made public for the first time
yesterday at the board of trustees’
student affairs committee meeting,
was a surprise to the group of
75-100 students who attended the
meeting after staging a quiet
“study-in” outside the meeting
room.

Members of the Inter-Residence
Board (IRB), who had prepared for

-the meeting with the policy dated
' Jan. 31 in mind, s id during the

meeting that they thought the
newest policy was a violation of stu-
dent rights. But later in" the day
after the board of trustees’ 3 p.m.
meeting in Forbes Quadrangle,
Robbie The, chairman of the IRB’s

security committee, called the day’s

“The board was very considerate

of the students’ view,” said The.

a victory for resident

' “They valued the student input.
We (the students) weren’t con- '

sidered a brick wall.”

One of the most important results
from yesterday’s meetings, accor-
ding to The, was that the new
policy, which goes into effect in
May, will be reviewed at the end of
the spring session.

Ruggero J. Aldisert, chairman of
the board’s student affairs commit-
tee, said that the administration will-
submit a report to his committee
shortly after the end of spring term.

That report would review how the i
new policy operated during that

two-month period and would be

discussed at a future meeting of the
committee. , ‘

Aldisert was impressed with the
students who expressed their con-
cerns about the policy.

“They ‘asked very intelligent
questions, were very senstive, and
had strong feelings,” said Aldisert,

  Council Ponders Film Studies Certificate Program 

By TERESA SOKOL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Issues surrounding a proposed
l8-credit certification program in
film studies were discussed by the
Council of the College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) on Monday at a
meeting held on the ninth floor of
the Cathedral of Learning.

‘Although CAS Dean Irwin J.
Schulman had termed the film
studies program “uniquely
situated” in terms of student and
faculty interest, points of a possible
foreign language requirement, ex-
pected student participation in the
program and the position of a pre-
sent program with Pittsburgh Film
Makers were raised by council
members.

The film studies certification pro-
gram is designed to give students a
basic understanding of the history
and theory of film, according to

I Lucy Fischer, coordinator of the

program.

The vast number of film studies
programs at universities nationwide
demonstrates that the program is

respected and should be well ac-
cepted by students at Pitt, accor-
ding to Fischer.

Fischer added that film is a “par-
ticularly rich and rewarding ﬁeld of

study...that necessitates its own.

mode of analysis.” Study of film
for a certiﬁcate would be inter-

_disciplinary, Fischer said since film

is researched in many areas,‘ from
psychology to commercial mass
medium. I

The decision to apply to CAS

Council for a certificate in film
studies, added Fischer, is again due

to’ the unique situation Pitt finds

itself in.

Qualified faculty available to give
guidance to students and the
nearness Pitt has to established film
programs such as Carnegie Institute
and Pittsburgh Film Makers have
are distinct advantages, she said.

“Locally, there is a real at-
mosphere of film culture,” noted
Fischer. ’

The university's relationship with
the Film Makers may be a financial
stumbling block,

according to

Schulman. Besides paying the flat
tuition for a three—credit class,
students taking CAS 100—a course
currently» taught at the Pittsburgh
Film Makers—also pay a $100 sti-
pend to the Film Makers.

Efforts would probably haveto
be made to regulate this financial
relationship, noted Schulman, and
added that council would research
this.

g _
However, Fischer urged
Schulman not to let the financial
aspects cloud the issue of the value

of a certificate program in film

studies. Creation of such a pro-
gram could also attract more
students to the university, Fischer
said.

In other academic areas, CAS
Council approved two university
Honors Program courses in
folklore and electronic music?

Council members also discussed a
possible foreign language require-
ment as a useful addition to the film
program.

Board Rejects Emergency Funding Plan for G

7'‘L.

By ROBIN L. LUBIC

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Allocations committee’s
recommendation concerning
emergency funding for Greek Week
was rejected by a majority vote of
SGB members at the SGB meeting

Monday night ‘in the Student a

Union.

. Bill Wallander, financial officer
for Greek Week, asked the board to
reject the recommendation
presented to the Allocations com-
mittee so that new information

.,A.';3,_r«;uld be presented to the committee

By RICH LAZZARO

Pitt News Staff Writer

We’ve all seen old movies in
which a mysterious-looking man
transforms a beautiful young lady
into‘ a mindless creature by telling
her to follow the swinging pen-
dulum with her eyes until she is

very, very sleepy. He then proceeds ‘

to make her perform any number of
tasks she wouldn’t even consider
while in a more coherent state.
This surreptitious character
might own a covered wagon with
the words “Dr. Marvel: Magician,
Palm-Reader, Hypnotist, and
Snake Oil Salesman” imprinted on
the side, in which he traveled
around the country bilking innocent
people of their hard-earned money.

This association betweena hyp-
notist and the shadier aspects of the
human race is inaccurate according
to John Kent, a co-founder of Hyp-
nosis Research Group of Pitts-
burgh. ‘

s  “A person can’t be madetoldo
something that isn’t already in their
nature,” Kent said. “For someone
to go out and rob a bank while in, a
hypnotic trance, they must have a
predisposition to do so.”

   

Q,

     

that would clarify some matters of
importance.

The problem with the Greek
Week budget, according to
Wallander, is the unexpected price
increase by the Hilton Hotel.

“The Hilton raised it’s price by
$1,000 which was unexpected, and
that is why we. are asking for
emergency funding,” 'said'
Wallander.

“With the funding. we had
before, everything was fine but we
can’t make our budget run with this
unexpected $1,000,” he said.

F Group Offers Hypnotic
Assistance to Problems

Although Kent’s organization

_ bills itself as a self-help group for

those with specific problems such as
smoking or losing weight, he is
quick to add that he believes hyp-

nosis can help most everyone with, l

ashe puts it,‘ “getting a handle on
your own mind.”

Kent also seeks to dispel the
stereotype of the “dumb, spaced-
out freak who can’t focus on life,”
as the main adherent to hypnosis.

. On the contrary, Kent believes hyp-

nosis requires “intelligent, sensitive
people who can focus their mind on
a particular thought or idea.”

Relaxation is the key to suc-

cessful hypnosis and this is why the
group begins their Wednesday night
meeting with a 10-minute sitting.
Susceptibility exercises designed" to

- measure one’s sensitivity follow this

procedure.

The group, which has been hav-
ing free weekly meetings at the
Unitarian Church in Shadyside

since its inception two -months ago, '

attracts two basic types of people

according to Kent. The first-come ’

seeking help with a problem. The
second are people with an interest in
psychology.

When asked by a board member
why the Greek Week formal
couldn’t be moved elsewhere,
Wallander said, “The Hilton is the
only place big enough to hold us
and they know it.”

Kerry Warren,‘ Allocations
chairperson, also
that “the-board reject or accept”
the proposal so that more informa-

tion could be presented to her com-

meeting. _ ’
“Everyone must sacrifice time to

help with Greek Week,” Warren
said. “We will hold an emergency

meeting to hear Greek Week’s new
information.”

Another issue of concern discuss-
ed at the meeting was the SGB draft
forum. The‘ Board still has not
reached a decision on whether to
send information to President
Carter or not.

said Blazer.

In
another board member asked, .
“Should we interpret the findings-
of the survey, then send it, or just
send the results of the survey letting
President Carter draw his own con-
clusions?” .

After a lengthy discussion on the
survey it wasdecided that it would

be left open to question at Wednes- ,

VISITATION POLICY

" The following procedures and regulations governing guest
visitation have been developed for students in residence in or-
der to meet their needs of personal security, and to assure
students the right to privacy in their living units. A visitor or
guest is defined as a person who is present at a campus
residence at the invitation of a contractual student.

Students may establish and regulate with roommates their
room visitation hours between 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m.,
Monday through Friday, and from 8:00 a.m. Friday to 2:00
a.m. Monday morning. A residenceﬁhall living unit (a floor
or house) may set more restrictive limits on visiting hours or
on overnight guests by a majority vote. All-visits are subject
to the following conditions:

—The roommate’s approval is required. ,

—All residents and visitors must present identification to
gain building entry. ,

'—Visitors must sign in and sign out. Visitors entering after
2:00 a.m. must deposit their identification with the Desk At-
tendant which will be returned when leaving.

—Visitors are the responsibility of the resident, and are
subject to residence hall regulations.

—-Residents may sign in no more than five visitors at one
time (exceptions may be approved by the Resident Director).

-—All visitors must be escorted by their host or hostess
while in the building.

An overnight guest isdefined as one_ who remains in a room
between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. Monday
through Friday. Residents may have overnight guests subject
tothe following additional conditions:

—Guests must register name and address and deposit iden-
tification with the Desk Attendant.~

—The roommate’s signature of approval is required.

—A‘resident can have no more than two overnight guests at
one time.

—Any one overnight guest may stay no more than three
days in any two-week period.

—The total overnight visits allowed for any resident
student is thirty in a given term. i

—An overnight guest must be a member of the same sex as

the resident(s) of the room, except _ for members of a

Richard Blumenthal, 33, the U.S.
attorney for Connecticut and a
former reporter for The
Washington Post, told a news con-

t,,f._erence the news leaks were “inex-

cusable and tragic” because they
endanger a sensitive investigation
and might damage reputations
needlessly. " .

Civiletti has said that in his time
at the Justice Department “nothing
has angered or frustrated me more”
than the leaks.

The attorney’ general’s concern
was reflected in his choice of "a
federal prosecutor with subpoena
powers to conduct the inquiry and
in the Justice Department’s
reported readiness to take the rare
step of administering lie detector

tests to as manylas 200 of its
employees.

Civiletti’s get-tough position also
seemed to be a response to

‘widespread questions in Congress

in which criminal charges have yet

. to be filed. '-

- Eight members of Congress and

. other state and local public officials

have been implicated in the
bureau’s 16-month-old bribery in-
vestigation, in which FBI under-
cover- agents posing as represen-
tatives of wealthy Arabs offered
bribes in exchange for promises of
political inﬂuence. —

The allegatons were understood
to be based on 52 hours of secretly

a summit meeting——similar in im-
portance to the notorious gathering

of more than 60 crime syndicate
bosses at Apalachin, N.Y., in 1957.

The purpose of the summit was
to carve new geographical boun-
daries for the illicit operations of

NEW DELHI, India-Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the
Soviet Union accused the United
States on Tuesday of subverting
detente and warned Pakistan it risks
its independence by backing
America and’ China in the
Afghanistan crisis.

Pakistan will “undermine its
position as an independent state” if
it allows the United States and its
allies to convert it into " a spr-
ingboard for further escalation of
aggression” against pro-Moscow
Afghanistan, Gromyko said in a
speech deliverd at a banquet given

National

WASHINGTON-—.The number of.

television stations employing a
full-time news staff of 20 or more
people jumped 100 percent over the
last seven years, a new study says.

In contrast, radio newsroom
staffs have shown little signiﬁcant
growth, according to the Radio-Tel-
vision News Directors Association.

in his honor by India's Foreign
Minister, P.V.N. Rao.

Gromyko’s stong words came
after a first round of talks With In-
dian leaders on the Afghan situa-
tionduring an official two-day visit
here. Prime Minister Indira Gan-
dhi, a longtime friend of Moscow,
is making low-key efforts to defuse
the Afghanistan crisis and get the
estimated 90,000 Soviet troops
withdrawn from the neighboring
country.

If the Soviet foreign minister was
persuaded by the cautious and
friendly statements of Mrs. Gandhi

The association’s 1979 survey
found that almost a third of TV
stations now employ 20 or more
people full-time to gather and
report the news. The “typical” TV
news operation now has at least 13
full-time staffers, the study adds,
compared to nine in 1972. '

On the radio side. the survey

and Rao during their three hours of
meetings, he gave no indication.

Gromyko defended the Soviet in-
tervention, attacked the United
States and China and delivered the
warning to Pakistan, which is slated
to receive about $400 million in
U.S. arms aid. ‘

He said the United States was us-
ing Pakistan in an “increase of in-
ternational tension for subversion
of world detente and escalation of
the arms race, which has been pur-
sued by her for quite a long time.”

“The same road is followed by
the Peking leadership, which pur-

said the typical station last year
employed only one full-time re-
porter and one part-time reporter,
noting those results were virtually
identical to a 1976 survey.

The study is based on responses
from 473 commercial TV stations
and 400 radio outlets around the
country.

sues the course of the great-power
hegemonistic policy,” Gromyko
said.

He said was it was “abusrd and
dishonorable” to blame Soviet ac-
tion in Afghanistan for increased
regional and world tensions. “The
responsibility for this entirely rests
with the forces of imperialism, first
of all certain circles of the USA

I which are possessed with the idea of

military superiority, which would

like to change in their favor the‘

balance of forces in the world and

revive_the time of cold war,” he
declared.

Reporters were not admitted to

the banquet. The Soviet Embassy -

provided Indian media an English
translation of Gromyko’s remarks.
A The veteran Soviet leader’s
speech followed one by Rao urging
“utomost restraint, both by coun-
tries of "the region and outside
powers, in the best interests of
regional peace.”

An Indian government
spokesman indicated Mrs. Gandhi
had urged Gromyko during their
talks to pull Soviet troops out 0%‘

Neighborly Ways

For the past two decades, local residents have been -

complaining to university and local officials about

. U’ Pitt fraternities housed in Oakland neighborhoods.
* Although the local residents filing those complaints

are few in number, it appears that university officials
are finally buckling under by failing to stand up for
the fraternities’ rights.
Informed sources alleged the university will push
for the eviction of two fraternities living in univer-

sity-owned houses on the grounds that thosehouses .

violate local health and fire ordinances. The sources
allege that the Pitt administration will ask city of-
n

ficials to cite the violations in the near future.

In a related story, the same sources allege that
plans to build a graduate housing facility adjacent to
the Bristol Apartments on the corner of Dithridge
and Bellefield streets will be shelved.

In both cases, sources say the university will sell
the land involved to private investors and earn a high
profit.-

Several observations can be made upon
examination of these allegations.

First, the affair indicates the university ad-
ministration is unwilling to flex its economic and

political muscles to stand up to the local residents-

applying pressure on Pitt.

In many cities with large urban campuses, univer-
sities exercise large amounts of clout by maintaining
input into the city. political systems. It would
probably be deemed ludicrous in those cities to see a

large urban institution like Pitt buckle under to the

pressures of a few community organizations.

Pitt, by virtue of its number of employees, is one
of the most powerful economic forces in the area, but
it is showing its cowardice if it bends to meet the
demands of the local residents. The Oakland mer-

chants and the city would be in hot water without the A

university. Pitt students, faculty and staff are the

major consumers of those merchants’ goods. Fur— '

ther, Pitt is the largest private employer in Pit-
tsburgh. Where would the local residents be without

the university?

With this much power, why can’t the university
stand up for its Greeks. _ .

The Greek system is a valuable learning experience
for its members and supplies many community
charities through money and manpower. Yet the
university administration continually fails to protect
the system. _

This experience also shows that Pitt is more in-
terested in money than the welfare of its students.
The informed sources say the university may earn
from $500,000 to $750,000 by selling the land to
private investors. Not only will the eviction of the
fraternities result in less pressure from the neighbors,
it will also land a tidy sum for the university’s bank
account. ’ _

The allegations that the university will shelve. plans
for graduate student housing are even more distur-
bing. ‘How can local residents be unhappy with
students who, in most cases, are quiet and studious?

59.

It is not an undergraduate residence hall that has .

_ been proposed; it is a housing facility for mature

students, interested in earning an advanced degree

,. and going on to bigger and better things.

It is time for Pitt to support its students and fight
tooth and nail for the rights the university has earned
through its contributions to the city and ‘county.
Pitt’s soft line toward community complaints has
gone too far. ‘ A

The change in leadership in the

“The society that degrades its

spoke those words upon his
acceptance of the 1957 Nobel Peace
Prize. The words hit home in an
offbeat sort of way.

During my. last trip home, I was
passing time reading Orwell’s
“1984.” Almost ‘everyone has read
1984, with its stark vision of

Triiought control now only four years

the problem with the 70s was that

they produced no visionaries, not

even a Timothy Leary.

that the 70s‘ were most identified

70s were not that much of a
drought. However, the question
did leave me thinking,‘ who did the
70s produce? Part of the problem
lies in the fact that the best
identiﬁer of “visionaries” is time,
and it is hard to label a visionary in
his own time. -
But the 70s did produce
visionaries; what was lacking was
the common attitude that sur-
rounded such ﬁgures as Bobby
Kennedy. What was lacking was
not visionaries, but the vision with
common shared attitudes. Jimmy
Jones at Jonestown was a
visionary, yet few of us would like
to identify with his vision.
However, not all visionaries
offered such a pessimistic outlook.
David Ewing ‘wrote the book,
“Freedom Inside [the Organiza-
tion,” which concerned the exten-
sion of concepts equated with the

world of corporate hierarchy.
Ewing offers a way of dealing with
what will become an area of
increasingconcern to those in the
corporate world, and many of us
who will soon be in it. Yet how
many have heard of Ewing?

In 1970, Charles Reich wrote
“The Greening of America” which
deals with the development of
consciousness in the post industrial
society. His view did‘ gain a
somewhat wide horizon.

Richard Barnet and Ronald
Muller wrote “Global Reach” in
1974, and raised the question of

‘how the internationalization of life,

especially through the aegis of the
multinational corporation, will af-
fect our life.

The energy crisis brought forth a
spate. of views. But among the
more interesting was the work of
the Club of Rome producing “The

' Wedllesdﬂy. February 13, S1980-Page 9.

Reshaping the International Or-
der,” both concerning and predict-
ing the resource shortage, and
proposing ways to deal with it.
Perhaps the most futuristic of all
was Princeton’s Richard Falk’s
views concerning the emerging
international system. Falk "also
produced along with Barnet, the
work “Security Through Disarma-
ment” concerning aspects of the
arms race.

And who has to say it has not all
brought forth some results. When,
before the 70s, did an American
President ever announce Human
Rights as a policy in American
foreign policy. Granted it was not
always applied evenly, but it did
exist at least in degree.

Thus what was lacking was not a
vision in the,70s, but the sharing of
a common vision, which may be yet
emerging as a result of “scarcity”

' to Camus.

   A Decade for Visionarieswithout a Common Vision

Indeed one might add a corollary
And that is vision will
stand the test of time, and while
not always recognized in its time,
may be recognized at another. The

1970s, surprisingly, may be known \

for some of its visions at a.-later

date. _

By The Associated Press _
I.'AKE"PLACID, N.Y.—The In-
ternational Olympic Committee
announced yesterday the Olympic
Games will go on in Moscow was
planned, thus rejecting President

' Carter’s call that they be moved or
. cancelled because of the Soviet ’

intervention in Afghanistan.

The committee also urged that
members of the Olympic organiz-
ing committee in Moscow inform
the? “highest authorities of their
government of the circumstances

which have created these difficul-
ties for so many National Olympic
Committees.’ ’ "

Lord Killanin, president ,of the
IOC, said that all 73 members
attending the IOC general session
before the Winter Olympics had
voted to keep the Summer Games
in Moscow. According to the U.S.
State Department, more than 30
governments—as opposed to
Olympic committees—have called
for movement, postponement or
cancellation of the Games.

Killanin said the IOC recognized
the difficulties the United States
Olympic Committee faced ‘but

urged it to “continue its efforts to.

make possible the participation of
its athletes in the Games.”

The U.S. committee had pre-
sented the IOC with Carter's
demands.

The IOC had been deliberating
for three days, although there was
little doubt that the members
would abide bytheir agreement

with the ‘Moscow
Committee.

Organizing

“The IOC is fully aware of, and
sensitive to, the world conditions
which have created the most
serious challenge to confront the
Olympic Games,” Killanin said in a
news conference Tuesday night.
He concluded:

“The IOC cannot solve the
political problems of the world. but
calls upon the governments of all
countries, and in particular those of

_the major powers, to come together
to resolve their differences, and l,
as president of the IOC, and all
members, will do everything in our
power to assist in this so that the
Games of the XXIlnd Olympiad can
take place ' in t‘he right atmo-
sphere.”

Killanin noted that all 142
recognized national Olympic com-
mittees are bound by Olympic rules
and they alone, and not their
governments, can accept or refuse
invitations to the Olympic Games.

_Pitt News Staff Writer

They were a couple of final scores
that could have easily made Satur-
day afternoon’s Prudential Foot-
ball Scoreboard and strong rumors

vdid circulate Ann Arbor that Bo

Schembechler was back pacing the
sidelines, keeping his first string of-
fense on the field until he was sure
of his squad climbing a notch in the
AP polls.

But, actually the. sport was
wrestling—and from the look of
things Michigan and Michigan State
were doing most of it.

The buzzsaw in question was last
Saturday night’s 60-3 defeat at the
hands of the Michigan State Spar-

V tans and a not too kind 46-0 pasting

by Michigan Sunday afternoon in
Ann Arbor. Consequently, one
would expect Panther head coach
Rande Stottlemyer to have little to
say about last weekend's double
thrashing, and it was true that what
the Panther coach did say was short
and to the point.

“Against Michigan State we
looked bad,” said Stottlemyer.
“I’d .have to say that it was our
worse effort of the season.”

“At Michigan we were still bad,

but it was a better effort. They had -

a very strong contingent,” he add-
“I’d say they were the best
wrestling team we’ve faced this
year.”

Things started out bad on two
counts for the Panther’s as injured
118-pounder Glenn Maxwell sat out
both matches over the weekend.
Without Maxwell, pitt lost three of
their .first five matches by falls
agains Michigan State, as the Spar-
tans leaped out to a 27-0 lead.

Sandwiched around those pins
were an 8-4 decision by Michigan
State's jeff Thomas over Glenn na-

- cion at 134 pounds and a default by‘

Pitt’s Jeff Gordon to 142-pounder
Gary Crump. ’ '

The Pitt women’s basketball
team, now 19-8, will go after their
20th victory tonight, a feat never
before accomplished by a Pan-
therette squad. If Pitt should
emerge victorious, the win would be
doubly sweet, for their opponents
are none other than the Lady Lions
of Penn State, currently 17-11.

The two teams met earlier this
year for the championship of the

4' Pitt Invitational. The Pantherettes

Panther grappler Pat Connor (0
Michigan, losing two matches.

Gordon, who has suffered
through a series of injuries this
season, sustained a neck injury dur-
ing the Michigan State match, caus-
ing the default and barring him
from wrestling against Michigan.

At 158 pounds, the Spartan’s
Fred 'Worthem defeated Panther

, Eric Harris by a 16-2 score _which

was followed by anothe rpin, Steve
Foley planting Pltt 167-pounder
Wayne Lawrence.

After Panther Jeff Wilps was
disqualified for stalling at 177
pounds, Pitt corralled its only vic-
tory of the weekend as 190-pounder
Kurt Kuranovich defeated Statc’s
Scott Shepard ll-5.

Applying the final touches to the
masterpiece, heavyweight Stan
Whitcomb pinned Pitt’s Steve

scored an upset 58-45 win over
Penn State in that game. While this
win helps the Pantherettes boost

’ their confidence, it also gives Penn

State fuel for revenge.

The Pitt scoring attack willbe led
by Debbie Lewis, Pam Miklasevich,
and Penny Welsh. Lewis and
Miklasevich are averaging 17.5
points a game, while Welsh con-
tributes 14.4 points per game.

Penn State has only one scorer in
double digits. Corinne Gulas, a
freshman‘, averages 11.8 points per

“Smokey” Smocharski, making the
final outcome stand at 60-3.

Tied into a neat bundle by the
Spartans, Pitt was next tossed into
Ann Arbor, just in time to grapple‘
with 18th-ranked Michigan Sunday
afternoon.

Against the Wolverines, pins
weren’t as frequent, but Michigan
made up for that by blanking the
Panthers.

Taking over for Maxwell, Mark
Yurich lost by a _l0-I score to
Michigan’s Torn Davids to start off
the match.

Next, Panthers’ Bill Clark and
Glenn Nacion wrestled tough, but
lost two close decisions. at 126
pounds, Wolverine Larry Haughn
defeated Clark 7-5 and at 134
pounds, Nacion stayed withformer
Pennsylvania State champ Bob

game for» the Lady Lions. -
However, Pitt must watch out for
senior Jen-Bednarek, whose outside
shot is almost unstoppable when
she is hot. ’ '

The Pantherettes also seem to
hold an edge in the rebounding
category. Miklasevich leads the
team with 12.2 rebounds per game.
She is aided by Gail Aughburns (9.7
rpg) and Welsh (8.5 rpg).

The Lady Lions are led by Mary
Donovan and Louise ‘ Leimkuhler.
Both women are pulling down 6.4

Siar, only to losepto. siar by a 4-0 _
score.

Due to Gordon’s injury at

_ Michigan State, Pitt forfeited the

142 pound match, giving
Michigan’s Mark Pearson the day
off.

Leading by the score of 16-0 and
smelling blood from the Panther
wounds, the Woverines reeled off
three more wins in the 150, 158 and
167 pound weight classes.

  
       
      

rebounds per game. Part of the
Lady Lions’ problem is that they
must go with three guards on their

(offense.

The most important thing to
remember is that statistics are not
everything. All of the advantages
Pitt has are almost balanced by the
fact that the Pantherettes will be
playing in University.Park, which is
not such a warm-‘place for Pitt-
sburghers.

therettes notched their 19th win via

At 150 pounds,_ sophomore
Mario Mancini replaced injury-

ing a bad back, and lost a 12-1

  Olympic Event   Tickets

By The Associated Press

LAKE PLACID, N.Y.—Tickets to
the XIII Winter Olympiad are going
anywhere from $10 to $10,000, but
no matter what price an Olympic
tourist pays, one thing is for
certain—he won’t even get into this
winter playground without one.

A $10 ticket gets a spectator
through the gate only long enough
to watch athletes train before their
event. A $10,000 fee buys a gold
card, an entre to all events during
the two-week sports spectacular.

.In between, visitors are plunking
down from $20 to $60 per event at

Tﬁuthorized ticket outlets and much

more to scalpers and tour operators.

who hadn't sold out by Tuesday as
the first competitions started.
On the back of the Olympic

tickets is a warning that it may not
be “resold or offered for resale at a
premium in excess of the amount
allowed by any federal, state or
local law or regulation.” New York
state law, which outlaws scalping,
is applicable only in cities. Lake
Placid is a village.

“I’ve heard about it happening,
but we haven’t found anybody
doing it yet,” Lake Placid Police
Chief Horace Pratt said Tuesday.
“If you have something somebody
wants I guess you can get what you
want for it.” I‘ '

State police said they knew of no_
violations, either.

Organizers said 550,000 tickets
were printed and about 20 percent
remained unsold on the eve of
Wednesday's opening ceremonies.

 - gpikers’ Captain Beavers Looking for Comeback   

- By ANNA ARLOTTA

Men's volleyball is in its second
year of competiton--a sophomore
season ﬁlled with new faces both
on the Panther squad and on the
other side of the net. The
competition is tougher, thanks to
coaches Ray Reilly “and assistant
Mike Hebert who arranged a_
schedule to give the -team more
experience against top-notch com-
petitors. But then again the
Panthers are a very much improved
team.

Leading the way into this young
season is the Panthers captain Jeff
Beavers, the only senior on Pitt’s
team this year. In the Panthers’
initial season last year Beavers was
named most valuable nlaver

“It was quite an honor to be
named MVP last season,” said
Beavers. “Everyone involved with
the program last year was so into
making it work. Our improvement
so far this season has shown that
we are bringing good collegiate
volleyball to Pitt.”

When Beavers first came to Pitt
four years ago from Penn Hills
High School, volleyball at Pitt was
just a club sport. He began playing
as a freshman in high school where
he took up the sport to stay active.
During Beavers’ four years at Penn
Hills his team competed in state
championships and ended up in the
top ﬁve in the state each season.

“When I~first came to Pitt, all

there was in the line of volleyball ,

if

was a club team, said Beavers.
“There were seven to ten people on

the team and we used to compete__

wane nenrme ran YOUR uré

American Heart Association

against local teams like CMU,
Slippery Rock and Edinboro. Every
weekend we would play tour-
naments with all the teams in the
league at the end of the season, we
won the league championship.”

That was the year before last,
when the team_ was given varsity
status, under head coach Mike
Hebert. Last year was a learning
experience for all those involved,
including Beavers who was one
player with a good deal of team
play behind him. From the squad
of a year ago, Beavers is one of the
few to ‘return, along with Scott
Robbins, Rick Camacho, and Brian
Devine.

This time around men’s volley-
ball has taken on a new look under
Reilly's head coaching instruction
and Beavers at the helm.

nearby colleges playing games and
tournaments that never went into
any NCAA record books. This year
the competition shows the likes of
powerhouses such as Penn State,
Ohio State and Ball State to name a
few.

The Panthers, who have been
practicing diligently since mid-
August (even though their season
began three weeks ago), are
coming together ready to face this
mature and experienced com-
petition.‘

Pitt opened up last September
with an exhibition match against a
Polish national team, a match that
enabled Pitt to knock heads with
some international. players.

“That was a great experience for

happy with the fact that we were

swon.-.on"s FirstAmbition is Olympics“

By STEVE THOMAS
Pitt News Staff Writer

When Stu Swanson was eight
years old, he first stepped foot in
Ohio’s Avon Lake. It was then that
he realized swimming would be a
big part of his life.

“I went to Sarasota High School
in Florida and was selected to the
U.S. National Team my senior
year,” said Swanson. “On the way
to Canada for the Canada Cup
Championships, I met coach Dick
Bradshaw of Pitt, who was the
men’s’coach at the time. I enjoyed
working with him and I knew Pitt
was one of the best schools in the
East. They had won the eastern
championship two years in a row. It
was after the Canada Cup
competition that I decided to attend
Pitt.”

Swanson became most serious.

about swimming at age 12 while
swimming at the Sarasota YMCA.
“Florida was a big swimming
state and I became involved with a
good coach named Tim Hill who
took great interest in me,” he said.
“He coached me for six years.”
Swanson, whose parents are
originally from Pittsburgh, has
enjoyed an illustrious career while
swimming for the Panthers. He is
holder of numerous records in

‘backstroke events and his accom-

“It has been great going
undefeated and being on a winning
team,” Swanson said. “All my
friends are swimmers and we’re
very close.”

He is a communications major
and plans to attend law school after

_ he graduates.

“My first ambition is the
Olympics. It has been my goal for a
long time,” he said. “I’ve
dreamed about it since I was a little
kid andl ﬁgured by about 1980, I’d
be ready.” ~

Swanson is 5 team player by all
means, but al' superstars do have
at least one nemory of personal
glory.

“When I was chosen as
All-American last year, it was the
most satisfying personal moment of
my career. As a team member,”
he added, “winning the eastern
championships my first two years
and hopefully: winning again this

_,year have been the high points of

my varsity career." ,
Like all winners, though, it hurts

to lose. ‘Only once in his career at"

Pitt has a darkcloud hovered over
Swanson’s great achievements. It
was just one weekend ago that he
was beaten by Bill Conrad of West
Virginia ‘by one-hundredth of a

“It was the first time I had lost
since November of 1977 and since
then I had beaten a lot of good
backstrokers,” Swanson said. “He
was just an old nemesis, and losing

' to him was the most frustrating and

humiliating moment of my career. ” I

With the Olympic boycott be-
coming more and more a reality,
Swanson expressed his concern
over this controversial issue.

“People don’t realize who this
(boycott) is hurting the worst. Thg,
athletesare sacrificing their jobs
and their education,” said Swan-
son. _“They are sacriﬁcing so much
and it is being taken away from
them. The boycott should be the
last resort. These athletes gear
their lives toward the Olympics.”

"People talk about the propa-
ganda involved in the 1936
Olympics, but the U.S. entered and
was overwhelming,” he added.
Now it’s 1980, and all this
controversy surrounds the Summer-
Olympics. I think it would really
humiliate the Russians if we beat
them on their own turf. I’ve come a
long way. Four years from now I’ll
be working, making a living and
probably won’t have time to swim.
There’s no ' such thing as a
professional swimmer. My career
will end here at Pitt.”

Heart attack and stroke will
kill about 850,000 Americans
this year. Thousands of these
deaths could be prevented by;
knowing and recognizing the
early warning signals. Ask your
local Heart Association.

Prevention is the best medi-I A ~  

cine for any disease. The
American Heart Association
wants to stop heart disease
before it ‘starts. By switching
to a heart-healthy lifestyle,
you can reduce your own risk._
Ask your local Heart Associa-
tion. And give to the Heart
Campaign.

Your child’s sore throat may
be nothing to worry about --
or it might be a “strep” infec-

» tion. Without proper treat-
ment, it could lead to rheu-

Heart Association. ‘
