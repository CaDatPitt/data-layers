RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt football team fell behind
early and never recovered, as;it
fell victim to another lopsided
defeat on Thursday night.
Hoping to improve after
last Saturday’s shocking loss to
Youngstown State, the Panthers
(0-2", 0-1 Big East) struggled

from beginning to‘ end in their _

Big East conference opener at
Cincinnati, ultimately falling to
the Bearcats, 34-10. .

A slow start and several

missed opportunities to get back
in the game doomed Pitt during
new head coach Paul Chryst’s
second game in charge, and
these early indications show it
might be a long campaign for the
new leader of the Pitt football
program.

In front of a raucous crowd
at Cincinnati’s Nippert Stadium,
the Panthers found themselves
down by two touchdowns less
than five minutes into the game.

The Bearcats (1-0, 1-0 Big
East) scored with their first of-
fensive play when running back
George Winn ran untouched for
58 yards and an easy score.

And after Pitt quarterback
Tino Sunseri fumbled the ball
shortly thereafter, Cincinnati
easily marched back into the
Panthers’ end zone. A 15-yard
touchdown pass from quarter-
back Munchie Legaux to

.In Andy Warhol’s hometown, three
street artists set out to pay homage
to the iconic painter.

But this wasn’t a typical art
show.

While reggae music blared over
speakers and the musty smell of
spray paint hung in the air outside

of the William Pitt Union from noon
to 6 p.m., the conversation cen-
tered around Israeli and Palestinian
relations. The event was sponsored
by Panthers for Israel, a Pitt-based
pro-Israel advocacy group. The
event featured three street artists
from the organization Artists 4
Israel — two from New York and
one from Newjersey — who spray-
painted their individual takes on

Warhol’s famous “Campbell’s Soup
Cans” on the side of wooden boards
in the style of modern street artists.
Sam Mellits, the president of
Panthers for Israel, said the event
was all about opening up a dialogue.
“We wanted _to reach a new
group of students who might not
come to an event or a lecture,” he

Pitt business student wins 35 10,000 in country music contest
Senior Randy A/an pursues his dreams of becoming country  0

Joe Chilson
Staff Writer

As the country music business‘

moves simultaneously in two di-
rections — pulled both toward
more traditional music and the
new pop sound — Pitt senior
Randy Alan endeavors to, as
Johnny Cash would say, walk
the line.

Alan recently returned to Pitt
with $10,000 in his pocket after
winning the “Sing Your Heart
Out for a Soldier” competition
in Nashville, Tenn. The compe-
tition, which was sponsored by
Dollar General, took video sub-
missions from amateur artists
singing the song “Lucky Me” by
Helene Cronin.

Alan won first prize out of 26
entrants with a video he filmed
on his cell phone. Country singer
josh Turner awarded Alan his

prize in Nashville at the historic
Grand Ole Opry stage. .
But Alan’s journey to Nash
ville began long before, on a
school bus in rural Saegertown,
Pa. When hepyvas younger and
still in his “metal phase,” Alan
began to take notice of country

music as the bus driver played it

on the way to school.

“I fell in love with it, because
it was songs that were almost
word for word about what I was

going through or my lifestyle,”

he said.

So Alan, who had always
liked to sing, decided to teach
himself guitar when _he was 16.
But it wasn’t until his freshman
year at Pitt in 2009 that he re-
ally decided to take his country
music goals seriously. He got on
a workout plan, lost 35 pounds
and started to write and play
music every day.

“When you have a hobby, it’s

something you like to do. You

do it every once in a while, and c
you haverfun doing it. I decided.‘
that I wanted to take this from a ' 0
hobby to something else. I guess -
I treat it almost like beingan ‘

athlete by working on it every
day,” Alan said. V .
Kelsey Hodges,Alan’s frien

and occasional collaborator,

says this kind of work ethic.is'
what she really respects about
Alan. I

“A lot of people _take [talent]
for granted,” Hodges said. “He
knows there’s hard work in-
volved.”

Hodges, who ‘worked with

Alan while he was in Nashville
and sometimes writes and plays
with him over Skype, describes

his style as a blend of traditional. .
country music and the new pop A‘ "

New student group looks to prep students for legal careers

Pat McAteer
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

During a late-night study ses-
sion last year, Pittjunior Bryant
Andrews—Nino came to the re-
alization that, unlike pre-med
and engineering students, pre-
law students lacked a cohesive
on-campus community.

“Literally, from curriculum,

you could study theater or you
could study political science
and any range in between and
still be pre—law,” Andrews-
Nino said. “You could join any
array of clubs, you could be in
any building on campus. That
structure and community isn’t
as deﬁned.”

So, with the help of other
Pitt pre—law students, Andrews-
Nino formed the University
Pre-Law Student Association in
August. He said the mission of
the new student group revolves
around developing pre—law stu-

dents through networking, Law
School Admission Test prepa-
ration and community service.

Despite being a new group
on campus, Andrews—Nino said,
the University Pre-Law Student
Association has attracted at-
tention from undergraduates
and Pitt Law School students
alike, with 17 members thus far.

As a part of the group’s net-
working goal, Andrews—Nino
said law school students would
pair with pre—law students to
provide them with mentoring
services like LSAT preparation
courses and general guidance
in their studies.

“Rather than having to pay
thousands of dollars for a Ka-
plan tutor or for academic
classes with a Kaplan profes-
sional, you can get that same
great experience from the cur-
rent grad school law school stu-
dents for free,” Andrews—Nino

said.

Additionally, Andrews-Nino
said the University Pre-Law
Student Association plans to
provide LSAT study guides for
its members. He said he’s spo-
ken with representatives from
Kaplan,a publisher of test-
preparation books, and hopes
to purchase some of their study
books for a discounted price
and then rent them out to mem-
bers.

But Andrews—Nino said the
group’s community-service as-
pect could be the most valuable
resource it offers, since such
service projects provide sup-
plemental credentials for stu-
dents applying to law school.

“To be able to say that I did
something tangible that im-
pacted my community — that,
in return, had a great impact on
myself, and that, as a result, al-
lowed me formulate the reason

why I want to pursue a speciﬁc
aspect of law,” Andrews—Nino
said. I V

Since the University Pre-
Law Student Association is a
new student organization, it’s
unclear whether they’ll receive
funding from the Student Gov-
ernment Board’s Allocations
Committee to cover the cost of
LSAT preparation books.

According to the Allocation
Committee’s manual from last
year, allocations requests that
primarily benefit members of
an individual student organi-
zation rather than the Pitt stu-
dent body as a whole should
factor in a “shared funding
responsibility,” meaning that

members will contribute to or-

ganizational funding.

But junior Mary Mallampal-
li, the group’s vice president,
said she’s hopeful the commit-
tee will consider the group’s

impact on pre—law students
when making a decision on the
group’s allocations request.

“We just hope that the Al-
locations Committee sees that
this group can really beneﬁt
students who are looking into
a future in law,” Mallampalli
said.

For students joining the
University Pre-Law Student As-
sociation, the new group is an
opportunity to bond with stu-
dents who share their interests
and career aspirations.

Sophomore Jen Hengst, who
joined the group earlier this
year, said the group provides
a strong support system for its
members.

“For me, at least, it’s the
ability to meet people who
want to do the same thing as
me,” Hengst said. “You have a
network of people that support

you.” -

said.

An example of that open dia-
logue happened when Karim Demi-
an, a freshman ﬁnance major who
emigrated to the U.S. from Egypt,
approached the group’s table and
questioned them about a point in
Panthers for Israel’s literature.

“You say that Israel has always
been willing to give up land for
peace,” he asked. “What do you
mean by that?”

The resulting discussion on
a wide range of topics that have
divided Israelis and Palestinians
for centuries, turned quickly from
the historic borders of Israel to
security fences to citizenship for
Palestinian refugees living in Israel.

Aharon David, an Israeli fellow
working with Hillel, ajewish stu-
dent organization, jumped into the
discussion and provided a unique
perspective when it turned to the
Gaza Strip, the tiny sliver of land
between Egypt and Israel where
Palestinians live in some of the
worst conditions in the Middle

East.

“I was with the [Israeli Defense
Forces], on the ground in Gaza,” he
said. “I know what it is like there.”

David, who moved from Israel

a month ago to work on Pittsburgh
campuses, acknowledged that “Is—
rael is not perfect” but drew on his
experience to ﬁnd common ground
with Demian.

And while the discussion was
passionate, Demian ended up ex-
changing email addresses and pats
on the back with members of Pan-

thers for Israel.

Mellits said such dialogue was
the reason for the event.

“We’re lucky enough for that to
be the norm,” he said, adding that
even in Israel, where sectarian ten-
sions are high, “it happens much
more than the media would have
you think.”

Panthers for Israel hosted artists from Artists 4 Israel on Thursday to aint wooden panel to demonstrate

    
   

But members of Students for
Justice in Palestine were upset over
what they viewed as the wooden
boards’ symbolism.

Both Mahmond Yacoub, a
Pitt junior and vice president of
Students for Justice in Palestine,
and Ryan Branagan, the group’s
president, thought the display was

reminiscent of the barrier Israel is
constructing along the West Bank.

That barrier, which also features
graffiti, is seen as one of the big-
gest impediments to peace between
the Israelis and Palestinians. N on-
violent and violent protests occur
along the roughly 440 mile—long
barrier.

“My parents came from a vil-
lage, Malha, which doesn’t exist
anymore because of that f*cking
wall,” Yacoub said.

Branagan expressed similar
frustration.

“Logically, that wall shouldn’t
be there,” he said. “Walls aren’t for
peace. They’re for division.”

But Mellits said that parallel
wasn’t intended.

“It’s just meant as a canvas, to
get people to come and start talking
and ask questions,”

Cole, a Brooklyn artist, and one
of the three artists putting his own
spin on Warhol’s “Campbell’s Soup
Cans,” said that while the front of
each board was an homage to the
artist, the backs of the boards were
available for anybody to paint any-
thing.

He said he attended the event
because he feels “Israel gets a bad
rap,” and wanted to present an-
other side of the issue.

“It’s a chance for us to unite un-
der art,” Cole said. I

the country charts.

Alan recognizes that these are the two
directions of contemporary country mu-
sic, and he tries to satisfy both demands.

“I really appreciate the traditional
style, but I recognize the market for new
music and the new audience,” Alan said.

Alan’s trip to Nashville gave him a
crash course in the traditional side of the
genre. Alan met Ron Harman, a supervi-
sor at the Country Music Hall of Fame,
who gave him a tour of country music’s
living roots.

“He’s very interested in the history
and tradition of country music,” Har-
man said.

Harman was able to introduce Alan to
country music legends like Jan Howard
andjimmy C. Newman and set up a lunch
for Alan with Jeannie Seely, who had a
Grammy—winning song in 1966.

Seely was very impressed with Alan
as a musician and as a person.

“His presence as a person renews all
your faith in young people,” Seely said.
“He embraces the history of country mu-
sic, and he can add to its future.”

Alan says he will finish school before
moving down to Nashville to try to make
it as a country artist. As for the $10,000

ep

prize, he plans to spend $2,000 on a new
Martin guitar and has yet to decide what
to do with the rest, but he said he is con-
sidering saving it to produce a ﬁve-song
EP.

Until then, Alan will stick it out in
Pittsburgh even though the country mu-
sic scene here isn’t very big. Alan says
he ﬁnds that country is less popular in
most cities he visits, as opposed to their
more rural outskirts, but he maintains
that everybody can ﬁnd something to
like about the genre.

“Love songs, songs about just having
a good time, maybe drinking beer, hang-
ing out with friends + who doesn’t love

. that?’.’ Alan said.

Obama
accepts
nomination

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

The race is on.

On Thursday night, President Barack
Obama accepted the Democratic Party’s
nomination to represent the group in the
upcoming presidential election. With the
Republicans having officially named Mitt
Romney as their presidential candidate
last week, the stage is now set to deter-
mine who will occupy /the White House
next year. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is
running alongside Romney for vice presi-
dent.

In accepting the nomination, Obama
focused much of his speech on the econo-
my, admitting to the audience gathered in-
side the Time Warner Cable Arena in Char-
lotte, N.C., that a solution to the country’s
economic struggles won’t prove simple.

_ “You didn’t elect me to tell you what you
wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you
thetruth. And the truth is, it will take more
than a few years for us to solve challenges
that have built up over decades,” he said.

At the end of his speech, Obama stated
that his party’s plan for the next four years
will “lead to new jobs, more opportunity,
and rebuild this economy on a stronger
foundation.”

“That’s what we can do in the next
four years, and that’s why I’m running for
a second term as president of the United
States,” Obama said.

Vice President Joe Biden introduced
Obama, with much of his speech also fo-
cusing on jobs and education.

“Look, President Obama knows that
creating jobs in America, keeping jobs in
America and bringing jobs back to Amer-
ica is what being president is all about,” he
said. '

Polls show that the election will be a
tight race between the two candidates. I

Like many of my college-aged
friends, I have a horrible depen-

to dangerous depths, and during
about three weeks this summer
without my stimulant, I was sus-
ceptible to random outbursts of
rage and an inexplicable need to
search the Internet for the an-
swers to random odd questions
that would come up in conver-

I’m talking about my emotion-

it to Google businesses’ hours or
ﬁnd my way somewhere, it’s just
not good enough.

conﬂicts with the amount of in-

I can’t get Wi—Fi everywhere. The

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Sitting on the Cathedral of Learn-

‘ ing Lawn has lost a great amount

of its appeal. The charming, play-
ful, scampering squirrels are vir-
tually gone. They have always
been part of the Pitt landscape
until now, but they are gone.

They have been killed by the
peregrine falcons that Pitt has
harbored, nurtured and enthused
over for the past few years.

So, Pitt has willfully protect-

ed, abetted, even.en_couraged_ the g a

powerful predators and aban-
doned the weaker, defenseless
prey to their fate, and so the
squirrels are dying from our
landscape.

It’s a metaphor for our capi-
talist society in our own little
microcosm of Pitt.

1 think we need to re-think our
enthusiasm for promoting these
falcons. I realize the falcons are
endangered and the squirrels are
not, but they aremore appropri-
ately left to less urban environs.

FOOTBALL

 

Football, free food bring Pitt students

Jasper Wilson
Assistanzf Sports Editor

With the lawn of the Petersen
Events Center entirely covered
in Pitt students, the football team
had plenty of support prior to
kickoff for the Panthers’ Big East
opener Thursday night.

But it wouldn’t last.

After Cincinnati scored on its
first play of the game with a stun-
ning 58-yard touchdown run dur-
ing which Pitt didn’t get a single
hand on the rusher, anxiety filled
the crowd watching the game on a
large screen set up for the event,
leaving the atmosphere uncom-
fortably reminiscent of Satur-
day’s mood during the Panthers’
31-17 loss to Youngstown State at
Heinz Field.

Student reasons for coming to
the screening of the game in the
ﬁrst place varied greatly.

to outdoor Watch party at Pete

Senior Jordan Walker spoke
candidly about his reason for at-
tending the. event.

“Baconators and Frostys,”
Walker said, referencing the free
food the local Wendy’s restaurant
provided for Pitt student viewers
at the event.

Walker also wasn’t optimis-
tic about Pitt’s chances before
the game —- a premonition that
proved accurate.

“I don’t have high hopes, but
I don’t think the rest of the Big
East is very good,” Walker said.

The massive line of students
waiting for the complimentary
food snaked across the Pete Lawn
more than an hour before the
game began.

Much as did the student sup-
port against Youngstown State,
the turnout for the game watch
put on by the Pitt athletic depart-
ment for Thursday’s game had
mixed results.

day evening. Pitt inst the game, 34-10. Bobby Mizia | Senior Staff Photographer

The Pitt band and cheer team
both made appearances on
Thursday, with the band’s play-
ing the alma mater resulting in an
awkward scene as some students
struggled with the tune.

Many students watched the
game intently, but others, such
as junior Jared Culbreath, also
mentioned the refreshments as
a key to their attendance.

“It has free food and free
drink. I mean, I’m going to stay,
but I’ll probably leave halfway
through,” Culbreath said.

Students’ faith in the team
to turn its fortunes around also
differed, and Culbreath was non-
committal in his appraisal of the
Panthers.

“They’re kind of iffy,” he said.
“It just depends on how they-look
at the beginning of the game, and
you can kind of judge how they’re

BK}. EAST BREAKDOWN

 

Rutgers, Louisville
begin season with wins

Dustin Gabler
Stqff Wrz'ter

The only two Big East teams to fall
in week one of the college football
season were the two teams that
won’t even be in the conference
next season —- Pitt and Syracuse.

Big East Senior Associate
Commissioner Nick Carparelli
took advantage of that irony last
Saturday night by tweeting, “The
#BigEast will be a better football
conference on the ﬁeld next year
than it has ever been!”

But Carparelli’s statement lost
validity when two of the teams
replacing Pitt and Syracuse in the
Big East next season, Houston and
Memphis, suffered even more em-
barrassing defeats.

. Pitt and Syracuse drop in my
ﬁrst Big East Breakdown of the
young campaign, but there’s no
doubt that the conference will be
weaker without the Panthers and
the Orange next season.

Rutgers

A 24-12 win at Tulane wasn’t
overly impressive, but the Rutgers
defense lived up to the hype that
it entered the season with, hold-
ing Tulane to only eight rushing
yards.

The Rutgers rushing attack

was led by Jawan Jamison, who ‘I

carried the ball for 112 yards on 18
carries. Quarterback Gary Nova
struggled to ﬁnd a rhythm, and

' Jamsion appeared to be the only

bright spot of the Scarlet Knights’
offense.

If its quarterback play doesn’t
improve, Rutgers won’t hold the
top spot for long.

Louisville

The Cardinals were the only. .
Big East team to pick up a win
against an opponent from a BCS
conference last weekend when
they rolled to a 32-14 victory over
cross—state rival Kentucky.

Talented quarterback Teddy

Bridgewater impressed, as did‘ "

running backs Senorise Perry
and Jeremy Wright, who both
recorded more than 100 yards.
The Cardinals should be up a lot
of points this season.

South Florida
USF powered past FCS-school

Chattanooga behind three touch-
down tosses from quarterback B.J.

Daniels, who could be a breakout“
star in the conference this season. ‘

coach Paul Chryst suffered a second loss in his new position as head coach of -the
Panthers as Pitt lost to Cincinnati, 34-10. Bobby Mizia | Senior Staff Photographer

wide receiver Ralph Abernathy
capped the four-play, 38-yard drive.

Pitt regained its composure and
should have scored twice in the second
quarter, but Sunseri squandered both
of the Panthers’ red zone opportunities
by throwing an interception to end one
drive and letting the clock run out on
another.

After the break, Pitt mounted an-
other drive, but once again the Pan-
thers offense stalled, leading to a Kevin
Harper field goal. _

Any possibility that Pitt would gain
momentum from getting points on the
board was instantly dashed, as the
Bearcats responded with a two—play
touchdown drive that essentially ended
the game as a contest.

Legaux, who torched the Pitt defense
with his arm and his feet all night, then
led a 99-yard scoring drive to confirm
Cincinnati’s dominance. He finished
with 205 yards passing, 117 yards rush-
ing and two touchdowns.

Meanwhile, despite a promising per-
formance from senior rusher Ray Gra-

   

ham, the Panthers offense never truly
threatened to get Pitt back into the
game.

d Graham ﬁnished with 103 yards on
19 carries, while freshman running
back Rushel Shell made his collegiate
debut by rushing for 31 yards on eight:
carries.

But Sunseri brought back bad mem-
ories of last season as he repeatedly
failed to capitalize on scoring opportu-
nities by taking sacks and making poor
decisions — although his offensive line
did him no favors.

Sunseri ended the defeat 24—for-37
passing, with 278 yards and a single
touchdown —— a completed pass to tight
end Drew Carswell in the game’s ﬁnal
minute. .

Pitt finished just 2-for-4 in the red
zone.

The Panthers’ next game won’t be
any easier, as Pitt hosts No. 15—ranked
Virginia Tech next Saturday at Heinz
Field in a preview of what life will
be like in the ACC for Coach Chryst’s
squad.I

BASK ETBALL

Pitt releases basketball
schedules for new season

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

With both Pitt basketball teams seeking re-
demption after equally disappointing cam-
paigns last year, the University’s athletic de-
partment released the complete schedules for
both programs’ 2012-2013 seasons this week.

After two exhibition contests, men’s head
coach Jamie Dixon’s Panthers will compete
for the ﬁrst time since last April’s College
Basketball Invitational championship victory
on Friday, Nov. 9 when they host Mount St.
Mary’s at the Petersen Events Center.

Pitt’s nonconference schedule is high-
lighted by its participation in the National
Invitation Tournament Season Tip-Off and
the annual City Game against Duquesne,

' which will be played on Dec. 5 at Consol En-

ergy Center.

The Panthers will then begin their last
season in the Big East with a home game
against Cincinnati on Dec. 31 at noon.

Other key home games include matchups

 with Connecticut (Jan. 19, noon), Syracuse
 (Feb. 2, noon), Notre Dame (Feb. 18, 7 p.m.)

and Villanova (March 3, TBA).

‘ \_ The women’s basketball team’s season will

also commence Nov. 9 with an 11 a.m. tip—off
against Youngstown State at the Petersen
Events Center.

Following a Dec. 8 showdown with
Duquesne, the Panthers, who ﬁnished win-
less in the._AB_ig East last season, will begin
play in women’s college basketball’s premier
conference.

Pitt will host Villanova (Jan. 12, 6 p.m.),
Notre Dame (Jan. 23, 7 p.m.), Georgetown
(Feb. 23, 1 p.m.) and DePaul on Senior Day
(March 2, 1 p.m.).

“This is an extremely challenging sched-
ule,” Pitt’s 10-year women’s head coach Ag-
nus Berenato said inga press release.

“Our players learned a lot about them-
selves and the league last year,” she added.
“The Big East’schedule\ offers a difficult test
each night. I am excited to watch our young
team compete and battle\day in and day out.”

good against inferior competition, but

*"-the struggles on the ground were scary

considering USF’s opponents. If the Bulls’
offense becomes one—dimensional, expect
to see another mid-season collapse from
Coach Skip Holtz’s team.

,.; Cincinnati

The Bearcats began their season on
Thursday night with a dominating win
against a disappointing Pitt team. Athletic
quarterback Munchie Legaux posed a real
threat throughout the game, and if he can
continue to lead the Bearcats’ attack like
he did in the opener, this offense could
be scary. '

The opportunistic defense will also
make plays for Cincinnati, so don’t be sur-
prised if the Bearcats end up winning their

1» .4 fourth Big East title in ﬁve years by the end

of this season.
Connecticut

UConn jumps up out of the basement

with the most dominating performance of

week one after the Huskies tallied a 37-0

 But much like USF, the Owls looked one-

inability to pass the ball. Quarterback Chris

Brown also chipped in with 19 carries, 145
yards and a touchdown.

Syracuse

In probably the most exciting game dur-
ing college football’s opening weekend, the
Orange dropped a back-and—forth decision
against Northwestern, 42-21.

While the defense ‘obviously struggled,
Syracuse’s offense looked potent. Quarter-
back Ryan Nassib threw for 470 yards and
four touchdowns, which makes him the
NCAA’s current leading passer‘.

After coming back to take the lead,
Syracuse’s defense coughed up the narrow
advantage by allowing a touchdown pass
with 44 seconds remaining. It doesn’t get
any easier for the Orange as they take on
No. 2 USC in New York City this weekend.

Pittsburgh

A shocking loss against Youngstown
State last Saturday was followed by
an even worse performance at Cin-
cinnati Thursday night, and the Pan-
thers appear to be set for a long season.
New head coach Paul Chryst will be hope-
ful after running back Ray Graham played
well versus the Bearcats, but the play of
the defense, offensive line and quarter-
back Tino Sunseri will all need to improve
drastically before the Panthers can climb
the standings. I "
