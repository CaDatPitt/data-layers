Despite President Wesley
Posvar’s assertion that the Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps’
discrimination policy requires a
national solution, members of
the University Senate Council
the
creation of a committee of faculty
and students to explore the
exclusion of gays and lesbians
from the ROTC program at Pitt,

notwithstanding the university’s L

anti—discrimination policy.
Political science professor

Michael Margolis addressed the

matter because credit for ROTC

classes is given in the Schools of

Engineering and Nursing.

“It would appear that because
of this policy and because of the
university  adopting a policy
which says we will not have
discrimination by sexual

orientation among all the other

invidious categories of
discrimination,” Margolis said; “It
is very clear that this group is in
violation of the policy, and in my
view, [ROT C classes] should not
[count] toward any degree [at]
this university.”

He later said, “Why were we
being forced to condone [ROTC
credits] through our policy? The

president’s statements in the
already had indicated,

paper 
that [Posvar] did not support the

policy but then made the
statement that ‘because loll
federal court cases,  this is the
policy. We can’t sit and overrule
the Army or whatever else.’
However, it seems to me that we
do have control {over}  giving

UNIVETRSSLTY or PI'I"I‘SBURGH

  
   

credit.”

While Posvar continued to refer
to the ROTC as an organization
outside Pitt’s control, Student
Government Board Presidentjulie
Shepard cited several universities
where the ROTC program had
been thrown off campus and told
the board that she did not agree
with Posvar’s view.

.“I can speak personally for
myself. CI disagree with your
rationale behind allowing ROTC
to continue, in that it does go
against the university’s anti-
discrimination policy. How can
we support, how can we advocate
this if it is not in conjunction with
our anti—discrimination policy?”
she said.

When Posvar said that he was
opposed to punishing the
students who were in the ROTC
by disbanding the program on
campus, Shepard asked, “Would
you be interested at all in at least
starting some sort of discussion
or movement about this instead
of  waiting until someone else
did it  or being a leader?” C

Posvar called Shepard’s
question “unfair” and added, “I
don’t really understand what you
are driving at.” ,

Sarah Thomason of , the
department of linguistics also

criticized the lack of action on the a

part of the administration. “I’m
disturbed, not to hear, the
administration sounding _ more
eager to change the policy by
action which other universities
have taken,” she said.

‘Former Senate President

‘Herbert Chesler introduced a

motion that an ad hoc committee
of the senate examine the issue
and report back to the council.

Summerlea Kashar/ The Pitt News

SGB President Julie Shepard (left) and Board member Katie Malespina gave their opinions on
ROTC discriminating against gays at yesterday's Senate Co'.:::cil meeting.

The motion carried uncontested.

Senate President James Mauch
explained that he, Vice President
Carol Redmond and Secretary

-Oxanna Kaufman would select

the group from faculty and
students affiliated with the senate.
‘fl hope we don’t get people on
the committee who are
particularly biased one way or
another, who are willing to take
an objective look at it. I would
hope they would take a very
disinterested, dispassionate look
at the facts and come out with
some ideas of what this institution
ought to do,” Mauchsaid.
When asked about the length
of time the process would take,
Mauch responded, “I’m more
interested that it be open andfair

and the committee be allowed to
do what it wants to do.”

Posvar added that outside
organizations should be
contacted. as well.

‘ “The [American.Association of
Universities], the American
Council on,Education and the
National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant

‘ Colleges —- those three are the

principal constituents, and I think
that you are reaching  a level of
political clout that could be used.”

Thomason said action could
have been taken immediately by
the senate. “I'd rather have had a
motion today to urge the
president of the university tojoin
with other presidents of
universities and urge the military

to change their policy.”

' SGB member Bob Batchelor
said that the motion was a step in
the right direction for the senate
but felt the university would be
hurting the ROTC—scholarship
students if the program was
removed from Pitt. 5

 ‘‘If the students couldn’t make
it through college any other way,
then the scholarships are more
important than changing the
policy.”

Shepard disagreed. «“I

understand that people are going A

to be affected, she said. “That’s

going to happen no matter what‘

you do. Somebody is going to be
adversely affected, but how do
you judge who is being
discriminated against the lmostl?”

Native Pole gives new "perspective on Eastern Europe

By Stacey Jakubowski
For The Pitt News

Normal political—science classes require
students to spend many hours reading
books to learn the history and politics of
countries.

But the students in an Eastern European
political—science class at the University of
Pittsburgh get a firsthand account of the
political situation in Poland from Longin

’ Pastusiak, a visiting professor from Poland.

Pastusiak, a noted author of books
pertaining to international ~ affairs, has
played a key role in revealing Polish
history of the past and present to people
living outside Poland. 5

One day in class, for example, Pastusiak
jovially mentioned the time his son woke
him up at 2 a.m. to tell him something big
was happening in Poland because tanks
were rolling into Lodz, his hometown.

“Russian tanks?” asked Pastusiak.

“No, Polish tanks,” said his son.

“Then let me go back to sleep, and we’ll

,  talk about it in the morning,” said Pastusiak

with a chuckle that made his penetrating
blue eyes even brighter.

Pastusiak said that the Polish tanks
significantly altered Polish history because
they signified the birth of martial law in
Poland. The tanks were used to enforce
the strict, new regulations governing
Poland under martial law.

Not only does 55-year-old Pastusiak
teach and lecture in foreign universities
and speak ﬁve foreign languages, but he
also is a former Polish Senate candidate.

~ He has authored over 40 books related
to the international—affairs ﬁeld, studied at
universities in different countries and
acquired several degrees, including a post-
Ph.D. degree.

In July of 1989, Pastusiak met President
George Bush during Bush’s visit to Poland.
Pastusiak presented Bush with a softcover
booklet titled George Bush. This booklet
was the first biography of President Bush
to be published outside the United States.

In return, Bush gave Pastusiak his
hardcover autobiography, Looleing
Forward. Pastusiak said it was not fair that

he gave the president only a softcover
booklet when Bush hid given him a
hardcover book.

Bush jokingly said,  is not the first
time America has helped Poland,” 5

Pastusiak’s interest in world affairs started
at an early age. t

“At age six, I started collecting stamps
from different countries,” said Pastusiak as
he ran his fingers through his spiked,
graying hair. “I put them in a stamp book
that had brief descriptions about each
country —— the capital city, population,
etc. This was how I first got interested in
international affairs.”

Pastusiak’s interest in world affairs
remained with him during his schooling.
But his first degree, a master’s degree in
journalism, was not related to international
affairs.

He obtained his journalism degree from
Warsaw University in 1957. T

Later that same year, he was granted a
scholarship to travel to the United States
with a group of Polish scholars to study at
the University of Virginia.

“This scholarship was significant because
it opened the educational opportunities

A for an exchange program between Poland

and the United States for the first time

since the Cold War years following World’

War II,’’ said Pastusiak in well-spoken
English with traces of a Polish accent.

A few years later, in 1961, Pastusiak
attended’ American University and

. attempted to get a Ph.D. in international

affairs in one year.

For 10 months, Pastusiak slept only
between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. and studied
every other possible moment. He
completed all the work for a Ph.D., except
for taking his comprehensive exam,
because he got sick and went to the
hospital after losing his vision.

The doctor told Pastusiak he was

suffering from exhaustion and that his ,

vision would return, but his eyes needed
a rest. Pastusiak was forbidden to read for
one month.

After his vision had recovered enough
that he could be released from the hospital,

‘ Potbellied pigs prove popular as the perfect pets

1.»

By David M. Krivda
For The Pitt News

Each morning before Monica
Marin leaves for work, she makes
sure to give her pet, Alexander, a
little task of his own —— just to
keep him busy during the course
of the day.

She hides three biscuits
throughout her Squirrel Hill
apartment, each of which
Alexander must recover in order
to receive his Oreo Double Stuf at
4 p.m. When she returns,
Alexander races toward her at
top speed, squealing and grunting
for his hard-earned reward (which
he has yet to be denied).

Following their afternoon walk,
Monica and Alexander then relax
on the couch to watch their
favorite reruns and unwind after
a hard day’s work.

When Monica adopted
Alexander three months ago, she
knew that he would be a unique
pet, but she never dreamed that
he would prove to be such an
affectionate and loyal friend as
well. No, Alexander is not a pooch
of any sort; he’s a Vietnamese
potbellied pig, America’s newest
and trendiest pet since  well 
the ferret.

However, don’t confuse these
miniature, portly pets with their
600-pound barnyard kin, the
Hampshire pig. Potbellies, when

fully grown, are about the size of
a basset hound, standing 16 to 18
inches tall and weighing in at
around 60 to 70 pounds.

Pigs are generally considered
to be sloppy, ﬁlthy and downright
offensive critters. But according
to Meredith Wille, who handles
potbellies at the Pet Pad in
Shadyside, these porkers actually
serve as the ideal house pet.

“Despite what most people
think, pigs are actually amazingly
clean animals,” she says, tickling
one of the pint-sized piglets.
“They're also one of the most
intelligent and affectionate pets
you could ever want.

“But the problem has always
been that you can’t keep a 600-
pound pig in your house.”

Potbellies, in many ways, are
trained and housebroken just as
puppies are. But Wille is quick to
add that the process is much
easier with a pig.

“Litter training is extremely
quick because pigs will
instinctively soil as far away from

their resting place as possible,”
she explains. But like a dog, the
potbelly’s toilet training should
be mastered before granting it
total freedom of your house.

In addition to being litter trained
with minimal difficulty, these
black, fuzzy porkers can also be
taught to walk on a leash, fetch,
sit up, roll over or even come
cruising down the kids’ Slip—’N-
Slide in the backyard.

Unlike the canine, however,
potbellies won’t shed, emit a

A stench, get carsick, assault guests

or chew on new shoes and/or
furniture. And ﬂeas, for some
reason, refuse to go near them.
Unfortunately, along with the
pros, of course, come the cons.
To begin with, potbellies aren’t
exactly cuddly. In fact, one owner
complained that snuggling with
his two-month—o1d Reuben was
similar to sleeping with ‘ a
hairbrush. Furthermore, they
won’t so much as oink at a burglar
nor are they much fun to run with
on the beach or in the park.

They’ll also gladly wreak havoc
on a nice, cleanlawn or knock
the phone receiver off the hook
with a quick poke of the snout.

The average potbelly, with a
life span ranging from 15 to 20
years, eats twice a day and
generally feeds on Purina Mini
Pig Food, which consists of
assorted grains and vegetables
compressed into nutritious little
pellets.

Aside from their daily pound of
pellets, these pigs also have a
taste for sweets — mainly honey-
roasted peanuts and caramel-
covered popcorn. They'll also
blissfully consume any
contributions from the dinner
table or whatever they can dig
out of a bag of groceries that has
been carelessly left on the floor.

Pigs are reported to have been

first domesticated in Southeast
Asia over 7,000 years ago, but it
wasn’t until the late 1960s that the
potbellied pig from the jungles of
Vietnam became a household pet.

During the Vietnam War, much

of that country’s natural habitat
was being threatened by the large-
scale use of Agent Orange for
defoliation purposes.“ However,
concerned villagers rescued the
potbelly from extinction by
bringing it into their huts.

In 1985, Canadian biologist
Keith Connell noticed these
plump pets while visiting villages
in South Vietnam. He liked the
idea of keeping them as pets, and
when he returned to North
America, he brought 18 little pigs
with him.

The Vietnamese potbelly soon
became the hip and happenin’
pet on the West Coast (where
else?) thanks to Kaya Mull, a
microbiologist from California,
who is now considered to be the
country’s premiere pig breeder.
Mull has sold hundreds of pigs
nationwide and manages to keep
a few around the house as well
—— one being her prized porker,
Pignacious, who enjoys such
water sports as “swine diving”

Diversity at Pitt...

Pakistani student alarmed by some
features of the American lifestyle

(Editor's note: This is the second of
series proﬁling the eagoeriences of
international students who attend the
University ofPittshu1gh.)

By‘ Pria Bhargava
Staff Writer

T alat Khurshed, a native of Pakistan
and a Pitt student, ﬁnds one aspect of
American culture to be particularly
confusing. '

“If you take out the wheels from one
part of the car, how can it move?”
Khurshed asks this question in regard
to divorce, single parenting and the
plight of U.S. children involved in such
situations. Although he is married with

two young children, he is able to work 9

on a doctorate in administrative policies

~ while serving on the executive board of

the Council of Graduate Students in
-Education and the executive board of
the International Students’ Group in
Education. I a

He is also president of the Pakistani
Students Association, an organization
established 20 years ago to “unite all
Pakistanis of the three universities and
colleges of Greater Pittsburgh, to look
after their problems and [to] get them
settled.” It is a nonpolitical, unaffiliated
social association that encourages
membership from other countries.

On this sunny day, this slim man with
a touch of gray in his well-combed hair
settles into a seat at the Schenley Cafe
and begins talking about Pakistan and
his reflections upon the United States.

Surrounded by India, China, the Soviet
Union, Afghanistan, Iran and the Arabian
Sea (which becomes the Indian Ocean),
Pakistan has a population of
approximately 120 million. The land
itself is a combination of plains, deserts
and mountains, including the K2 peak,
which is an extension of Mt. Everest.

An Islamic state “with full protection
for minorities,” Pakistan has religious
restrictions -— for example, no interest is
received on money saved in banks.
According to‘ Khurshed, “Islam forbids
such an, economy.” Also, it is not
uncommon to find people, particularly
those who work in government offices,
breaking For prayers at regular intervals
throughout the day.

There is also some segregation among
males and females. However, he feels
that is slowly changing, citing that the
country’s president is female. Also, “more
and more women are getting an
education, with some universities having
40 percent women.”

His first memory after coming to the
United States last August is an incident in

Universityeducation provides g
second chance for Vietnam veteran

(Editor's note: This is the second of a
series profiling the experiences of older
students who'attend the University of
Pittsburgh.)

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

Vietnam veteran Eric Dauphinee is
pursuing a degree at Pitt after a long
break from formal education.

“You sit back all your life and wait for
opportunities. Sometimes they just jump
up,” he said. For Dauphinee, that
opportunity was a long time in coming.

Dauphinee, now 43 years old, went to
boot camp at Parris Island as a Marine in
1964, just before the Vietnam War effort
increased. Dauphinee was then selected
to go to ﬂight school in Pensacola, Fla.,

‘where he learned to ﬂy. helicopters. He

graduated from ﬂight school in 1966 and
went to Vietnam.

Dauphinee fought in Vietnam from
May 1967 untiljune 1968. After he served
his time, he became a ﬂight- school
instructor and taught other students how
to ﬂy helicopters and survive in combat.
In 1970, he left the Marine Corps and
started to work in a variety of different
professions.

Dauphinee was a salesman for a
pharmaceutical company foreight and a
half years. He then took a course to

become registered to sell stocks and
bonds, which led to his becoming the
regional director of a company that
provided private mortgage insurance.
Unfortunately, in the late 1970s,
interest rates and inﬂation were soaring,
the company he was working for had
to make major cutbacks, and Dauphinee
was soon out of work. _
Dauphinee then went on part-time

active duty with the National Guard for

the next six years, until changes in the
National Guard put him back on the
streets. Dauphinee said that he was
having a hard time finding work.

“I was much older — much less
marketable. I had been away from the
drug business for a long time,” he said.

Dauphinee then got a job working
for an offshore oil company where he
transported equipment and people via
helicopter.

Dauphinee’s life made a turn for the
better when his wife, Joan, who lectures,
teaches and writes books on obstetrics
was offered a position with Magee-
Women's Hospital in December 1988.
Here was Dauphinee’s chance to go to
Pitt.

He said, “Joan came home and said,
‘Here’s the deal; if I go [to Magee—
Women's], you go to school.’ OK, twist
my arm. That’s how I got out of the oil

in 1964, U.S. and West German
Rearmament. This book, like his

. 40 other books, dealt with issues

surrounding international
relations of countries around the
world.

After completing his first book,
Pastusiakdecided he wanted to
expand his educational
knowledge to an even higher
degree. He studied to get a
habilitation, a post-doctoral
degree, in history from the.
Institute of History, Polish
Academy of Science in 1967.

Habilitation degrees are not

offered in the United States but -

can be obtained from many
European universities. In Europe,
it is higher than a Ph.D. and is the
next step a person- can take to
further his or her education after
obtaining a Ph.D.

-At age 29, Pastusiak became
the youngest man in Polish history
to get this degree, making him
one of the nation’s foremost
scholars. The average age to get
this type of degree in the field of
social sciences is 45.

“For a Ph.D., a person does
analytical work and has a narrow
focus on a particular subject,”
explains Pastusiak‘. “But for at
habilitation, a person has vast
knowledge on many topics."

Pastusiak has received many
honors for his educational
accomplishments and many
teaching invit.ati;ons from
universities around the world.

Ohio State University granted

~ Fasttlsiak the title of distinguished

visiting professor and invited him
to teachrat the university in 1983
for one year. He accepted the
position and taught at the graduate
school in the political-science
department. .

During the summer of 1989,
Pastusiak received a letter from

an official at the University of .

Pittsburgh asking him if he was
interested in teaching two
political-science classes on
Eastern Europe at Pitt, and he
accepted the job.

Pastusiak was able to accept
the position because he lost a
close race for a Senate position in
Poland last May. A

There were 32 people running
for the Senate position, and only
three people could win a spot as
a senator in the Warsaw district,
the district in which he was trying
to win a position. I

Pastusiak finished fourth and
collected over 200,000 votes —

about one-third of the voting
public’s support. This is normally
enough to get a person elected to
a Senate position, but due to the
highly competitive nature of the
Warsaw district, it was not enough
to get him elected.

Pastusiak does not think he
will run for a political position
again because he is more
interested in being a scholar than

a politician. But he said thatthere
were two advantages of running ,

for a Senate position.

“I got more publicity during
the five weeks I ran for a Senate
position than I have from writing
all of my 40 books, and I can no
longer walk down the streets of
Warsaw without someone
recognizing me,” said Pastusiak,

with a grin on his face. “And it '

was a great way to lose 10
pounds.” P
Pastusiak arrived at Pitt in the
beginning of January with his
wife, Anna. He will be here until

May S, the end of the term, and ‘

then he will return to Poland. ‘

At Pitt, he was delighted to
discover the myriad facilities

with the “PITT CAT” system in
the libraries and the “open-shelf’

such friendliness if rare in other

by touching it. Pakistan needs to
open its technology to students.
They need easy access.”

Khurshed grew up in Northern
Pakistan. Born in the city of
Kohat, he attended a university
in Peshawar and then began
working for the federal
government in Islamabad. He
plans to go back to continue
working there because “I owe
something to my country.” He
also wants to enjoy his family life
there and fears the inﬂuence
American society would have on
his children.

Khurshed said that “the family

structure isidisintegrating here,” .

attributing this mainly to the high
divorce rate. K h u r s h e d
talked to some divorced friends
of his and found it difficult to
understand how they could
divorce in spite of the many
experiences they have shared
with their former spouses. The
response he hears most often is
that the person changed and is

different from when they dated.

“But that is only natural; one
must be willing to accept change,”
Khurshed said. When people
continue to be miserable after the
divorce, he wonders why they
divorce to begin with. “In
Pakistan, the extended family acts
as a nucleus —- you get guidance
from -more people, [and the]
restrictions are such that you
cannot leave the nucleus.”

To Khurshed, divorce has a
domino effect, leading to crime
and drugs, which he cites as
another reason for the
disintegration of the family.

Khurshed feels that although

' teenagers want to do things their

own way during their
adolescence, they will probably
change their behavior when they
are parents. “In Pakistan, the social
pressures are such that [using
drugs] is the last choice or not

‘even a choice at all. There are

certain norms and ethics that
should not be crossed.”

Fortunately, you’ve got Vivarin. It helps keep you awake and mentally

If Freud had used Vivarin, maybe he could have understood the brain

Dealing with independence

The Soviet Union’s policy toward Lithuania has wavered
about as much as it did before the Baltic republic’s March
1-1 secession from the Soviet Union. Indeed, for a while
it seemed as though Gorbachev had broke from his earlier
demand that any attempt by the nation to secede would
result in “discord, bloodshed and death.”

However, such a violent reaction by the Soviet Union

A has not been seen. There has been no direct Soviet

military “invasion” or major confrontation — undoubt-
edly and principally due to the fact that such coercion
would sever any new progress or friendships between
Gorbachev’s Soviet Union and the West. Rather, the
Soviets have dealt with Lithuania through a more slow,
subtle and incremental manner. The Soviet Union has

i _ sought to intimidate the nation without destroying its

glasnost image.

The intimidation has been done in a step-by—step
manner": Soviet troops occupying some buildings in the
capital of Vilnius, the beating and seizing of conscripts
who deserted the Red army, Gorbachev demanding that
Lithuanians turn in their firearms, and displaying Soviet
military power bysending armored personnel carriers
through Vilnius. With the failure of this incremental
policy, Gorbachev apparently has chosen to resort to a
more overt policy of intimidation: He has demanded that
either Lithuania rescind its claim to independence or face

_ a Soviet economic blockade.

Gorbachev has threatened to cut off products, such as
oil and gas, that Lithuania buys only from Moscow at
subsidized prices. Aidas Palubinskas of the Lithuanian
Parliament’s information office said that Lithuanian facto-
ries would only be able to function for a couple of weeks
if the blockade is imposed. ,

The deadline for a response to Gorbachev’s demand
passed two days ago. He has yet to implement the
blockade. There isstrong bipartisan support by U.S.
congressional leaders against such a move by Gorbachev;
President George Bush and Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher will likely react with similar disapproval.

It’s time to see if Gorbachev really desires a peaceful and
lasting relationship with the West. Lithuania is rightly
defiant, and the West is impatiently skeptical. For the

Soviet Union, the Party could be over in more than one

way.

Reflections of a gay rights activist c

I sense a change sweeping our
country. I see people waking up
from a long nightmare of indiffer-
ence, intolerance and ignorance.
It has been a nightmare of de-
spair these past 10 years; our
conscience became self-centered
and lethargic. But in the first
three months of the new decade,
I see reason to rejoice. In Pitts-
burgh, the City Council passed a
gay equal-rights bill. No longer
will Pittsburghers lose their jobs
and homes without an avenue of
legal recourse. Campus student
groups like Students Against
Racism; Bisexual, Gay and Les-
bian Alliance; and FRIEND re-
flect a growing positive con-
sciousness at American universi-
ties. Despite the renewed con-
cern for liberty and justice, when
discussing gay issues with friends,
or even foes, I am amazed by the
misunderstanding that so many
people have about gay rights.

First, at a personal level, Iwould
like to explain “gay rights.” My
“conservative” outlook usually
surprises friends and especially
foes. I am concerned about find-
ing a job and keeping a roof over
my head. I am concerned about
my and my partner’s health and
well-being. This may seem triv-
ial, but I have surpassed more
than the average number of
hurdles. I have to fight every step
of the way. I testified before
Pittsburgh City Council in sup-
port of the Gay Equal Rights Bill.
I had to testify. Without the basic
legal protection set forth in the
legislation, I could lose or be

- denied a job because the person

that I love is a man. Without the

V legislation, I would be unem-

ployed with no legal recourse.
Even worse, without the legisla-
tionl could be denied housing or
even be thrown out of my apart-
ment if the landlord desired. 1
took a stand, and fortunately, we
won. But the victory is only luke-
warm. Discrimination, even ra-
cial discrimination, is difficult to

prove. I still have questions: D01
include on my resume the Stu-
dent Government Board award I
won’ for my work with BiGALA?
D01 lie about my sexual orienta-
tion? You see, it’s never over, but
at least it's better than before.

A month ago when confront-

 

Mark I

, Smith

ing foes of the Gay Equal Rights
Bill, my opponents thought that
the bill was unnecessary. After a
10-minute crash course on the
legal rights of gay men and lesbi-
ans, I heard, “Oh, I didn’t know
that you could be fired without
legal recourse. I guess I support
the bill.” People opposed the
legislation without a complete
understanding of the issue. Since
my article on sodomy laws —-
laws punishing gays and straights
for oral sex —- people have con-
stantly asked me, “Do people
really go to jail for having sex?”
“Of course,” I reply. At last,
people are rubbing their eyes in
disbelief.

Also, I worry about verbal
harassment and physical assault.
Gay-rights supporters ﬁght to end
anti-gay violence. A report pub-
lished by the U.S. Department of
Justice in 1986 reported that gay
men and lesbians face physical
assault seven to 10 times more
often than the average hetero-
sexual. I have been harassed at
Pitt. I could become another sta-

tistic. In July 1987, a man visiting
San Francisco en route to a dance
club was murdered because his
assailant perceived his victim to
be gay. The assailant screamed
“faggot” and “fmit” while he
stabbed the man in the face. The
tourist died two hours later; his
wife was informed of his death
the following day. This could
happen to you or me. This could
happen to the man that I love,
but I am going to make damn
sure it doesn't! .

Gay men, lesbians, bisexuals
and our friends changed Pitts-
burgh. Across the country, the
gay—rights movement has paral-
leled Pittsburgh. Sixty-six other
cities prohibit discrimination
based on sexual orientation. Two
states, Wisconsin and Massachu-
setts, prohibit discrimination
based on sexual orientation.
Presently, there is a move in
Congress to amend federal civil
rights legislation to include sex-
ual orientation.

The gay-rights movement lights 4

for more than civil rights. In
February, Congress and Presi-
dent George Bush supported
legislation to stop hate crimes
against gay people. Fighting along
our side, the American Civil Lib-
erties Union, conservatives and
liberals, fight against sodomy
laws.
and celebrities have declared war
on AIDS, not on people with
AIDS. The group Parents and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays
helps so many families confront
prejudice against their gay chil-
dren. Coretta Scott King once
said, “I believe gay people should
have civil rights equal to any
other people under the
Constitution  You know, we

Democrats, Republicans 53

are all God's children.” Gay rights 3‘

is not mysterious. It’s happening
right now!

Columnist bids farewell to some unthoughtful Words

Attention, readers: Please hold
back the crocodi1e—sized tears.
With the exception of perhaps
one or two unannounced, thrill-
ing appearances, this will most
likely be my last column for The
Pitt News. In light of that fact, I
feel it necessary to clarify a few
important things before I leave.

Through my experience as a
columnist and perspective editor
for 77JePittNews, I’ve come across
many words which are often
drastically taken out of literary
context for the sole purpose of
discrediting or quieting a person
whose beliefs contradict an-
other’s. These words are ubiqui-
tous in the ‘campus vocabulary
and are more often used errone-
ously than correctly in labeling
someone. The Big Five of the
campus oratory are Fascist, Rac-
ist, Bigot, Homophobe and
McCarthyite. When used “prop-
erly” in‘ collegese, these words
can not only have the effect of
nullifying the author’s comments,
but even worse, censoring him
(please excuse the “sexist” pro-
noun).

The first word of the Big Five is
fascist. Before I came to Pitt, I
had only heard this noun used in
the same sentence with Hitler or
Mussolini. But on campus it seems
to have no literary boundaries.
Although I personally possess no
Nazi ﬂags or even brown shirts
(now that I think about it), this
word has followed me around
campus like an Student Govern-
ment Board candidate on Elec-
tion Day. In fact, when I told my

Police are

Many of us have had some
really bad experiences with po-
lice officers. Maybe we were just
harassed — possibly we were
given citations or ﬂat out ar-
rested. Although not all police
officers are buttheads, many of
them tend to use their authority
in the wrong way and contradict
the “At Your Service” slogan.

Example: A few Saturday
nights ago I was at a party on
Dawson Street. I was not at this
party long and only had a few

"beers. I was not even close to

being intoxicated.

A bunch of people I was with
decided that it was time for us to
turn in because we like to go to
church early on Sunday morn-
ings. We left the party, and I was
completely unaware that I had a
plastic cup in my hand that was
half-full of fermented hops, bar-
ley and yeast.

We were not even half a block
away from the party when about
six undercover cops jumped out
of two unmarked patrol cars and
swarmed on me and the other
decent, law-abiding, moral, up-
standing members of the Oakland
community whom I was with -
interrupting, I might add, the
second verse that we were sing-
ing of a religious hymn.

The cops grabbed us and began
badgering us like we were hard-
ened crirninals. Almost everyone
was checked for the possession
of liquor and other substances.

‘ None of us had anything other

father that a half-dozen letter
writers had affectionately called
me a fascist for supporting Con-
tra aid, he replied, “A fascist?!”
You see, such an application is
alien to the external, civilized
world. In all theyears that I've
watched political shows on tele-
vision, never have I seen Michael
Kinsley or T om Braden jump up
and bark at Pat Buchanan, “What?!
You're a fascist!” And I’ve never
read a Congressional Quarterly
which disclosed that Teddy

Kennedy was privately sticking '

swastikas on the suits of senators
who supported aid to El Salva-
dor. However, on campus the
word “fascist” is fired at every-
body for every reason. This is
one of the blessings of radical-
ized campus life.

The next word is racist. This
tag not only applies to stupid
maxims such as those employed

by Andy Rooney, but it is often"

used when someone criticizes a
“racial” matter. For instance, if I
think that the Rev. Jesse Jackson
knows absolutely nothing about
foreign or domestic affairs .-
which he doesn’t — then I run
the risk of being tagged a “racist.”
This man compared our libera-
tion of Panama (a CBS poll
showed that the invasion was
supported by over 90 percent of
Panamanians) to the slaughter of
pro-democracy students in Tian-
anmen Square. He has made
numerous inane analogies. He
once claimed that abortion was
genocide against the black race,
and later he was seen striding

than what is legally sold at beer
distributors, bars and restaurants.

Some of the others were given
citations for not being a certain
age, while one officer was my
assigned oppressor. This officer
basically screamed in my ‘face

Staf

about having alcohol outside until
he singed the hair in my nose
with his horrible breath. He gave
me a pre-written citation for public
consumption of alcohol. This
ticket had already been drawn
up and written out; it merely
required my name and explicit
details of my offense. It was just
waiting to go into someone’s
pocket.

I protested vigorously by say-
ing how unfair all of this is. I was
told that if I kept up this behav-
ior, I would become the officer's
date for the evening. He offered
to drive me downtown for a

romantic evening of dancing in “

the cell block of my choice. City

arm-in-arm with pro-abortion
advocates at a D.C. rally. How-
ever, if I were to write a column
claiming that Jackson is a politi-
cal moron, I would be wise to
accompany my claim by noting
that such prominent black men
as Alan Keyes, Walter Williams,

 

Paul   . ,
Kengor

Thomas Sowell, Colin Powell and
Gov. Douglas Wilder are out-
standing public figures -— which
they are — merely to avoid the
racist label. That should not be
necessary.

Also, to oppose afﬁrmative
action is not “racist.” A 1981 Pub-
lic Opinion poll found that only

29 percent of non—whites support —
affirmative action. Are the rest of “

those non-whites racists? The best
way to judge the credibility of the
accusation of racism is to con-
sider who it came from. If it
comes fromJackson, Al Sharpton,
Rep. Gus “Ron Brown’s an Oreo”

cops have the best pick-up lines.
“No, sir, I have to wash my cat,”
I said, blushing and becoming
very quiet. J

The cops told me to watch out
and tell everyone that they are
cracking down in Oakland by
raiding more parties and by basi-
cally being more like my oppres-
sor/officer to innocent college
kids like me. T o prove it to me,
my officer and his friends joined
up with more cops and raided
the party I had come from.

Need I say more?

Although there are some ex-

" cellent police officers on the force,

the majority of cops, in my opin-
ion, have seen too many cop
movies. They are rude, mean and
just looking to hassle someone.

The fact that I had beer in my
hand, which is against the law, is
not the the issue. Since I'm of
legal drinking age and was not
intoxicated, the cops should have
made me dump the beer and just
given me a warning. It wasn't
necessary to scream at me and
give me a citation which I defi-
nitely cannot afford.

Some officers who huddle on
the corner in front of the “O”
most weekend nights tell me --
and I have seen this many times
—- that they will grab someone
for being loud or drunk and tell
them to “cool it." This is the way
it should be: police looking out
for the best interest of the people

whom they patrol, not looking to .

bust people and give them grief.

Savage or the Rev. Louis “Jews
are Hymies” Farrakhan, then it
has no merit. After all, if it weren’t
for racism, these men wouldn't
have jobs; it's in their interest to
ﬁnd “racism” even where it doesn’t
exist. It is our duty to ignore their
accusations; past ludicrousness
has forfeited their credibility.
This leads us to bigot. This
word is synonymous with fas-
cist, racist or homophobe. It is
the most broad of all derogatory
labels, possessing unlimited
applications. This word has a lot
of clout. I used to think that it
meant being prejudiced against
race or religion. However, you’re
in college, so live it up and use it
freely while you can. If someone
disagrees with you, then simply
call them a bigot 4- then they
won’t disagree with you any-
more, at least not in public.
The next word of the Big Five
is homophobe. If we were to
interpret this word literally, then
we would be remiss. The word is
supposed to depict someone who
is anti-homosexual and cast them
in a negative (i.e., bigoted) light.
However, only figuratively, not
semantically, does the word
“mean” hating homosexuals. The
suffix “-phobe” means fear. I have
been labeled a homophobe be-
cause I am against homosexual
conduct. However, I am not
“afraid” of homosexuals; I merely

disagree with that lifestyle. I

should be permitted to have that
opinion without being lambasted
as a bigot or being “homopho-
bic.” This word seems to have

Other cops grab kids, slam them
against a paddywagon and make
them spend the night downtown.

This is wrong. Treating people so ~

viciously is something they do in
the Soviet Union. C’mon, almost
all college kids get liquored up
every now and then and act in a
way that they probably shouldn’t.

The basic issue is that these
cops had already had tickets for
public consumption and under-

been created as a sort of defense
mechanism for gay-rights sup-
porters (homophiles?). If you
criticize homosexual conduct,
then they can cut you off with the

“homophobe” label, which is,

equivalent to being called a bigot
— a word which can thus ignite
speculation that you are bigoted
toward race and religion, also.
Finally, McCarthyite. Derived
from McCarthyism, the art of red-
baiting. Although his name is
associated with the flames of
Liberal Hell, we don’t even con-
sider, even after the immense

failure of communism, if the late

senator was partially correct:
communism stinks, doesn’t work
and nobody that has ever lived
under it has liked it. But you can’t

even blast Karl Marx or the Soviet _

Union during a Poll Sci 50 lecture
without needing to apologize first:
“I don’t mean to sound like a
McCarthyite, but...” Suchga state-
ment is often greeted with jeers
from the “but-America’s-just-as-
bad!!!” student crowd.

A corollary can be drawn from
the Big Five: What is most ironic
and incorrect is that these words
can be used interchangeably and
maliciously to silence a dissent-
ing "opinion. Let’s hope that
campus radicals don’t drag these
words into the real world. For if
they do, the First Amendment
will be flushed right down the
toilet. I put down my pen on that
thought.

, Continued from page 4
patch and into Pitt.”

Dauphinee started attending
Pitt in January 1989 and has
attended classes year-round. He
is now in his fourth term — soon
to have 51 credits under his belt.
He hasn't decided his major yet,
but he claims he wants to go to

graduate school to study
veterinary medicine in
Philadelphia.

At ﬁrst, Dauphinee and his wife
weren't too excited about coming
to Pittsburgh. “When I heard that
the job was in Pittsburgh for my
wife, I wasn't excited, and neither
was she,” he said. “Our
experience with Pittsburgh had
been back when the steel mills
were operating and we drove
through. When you just drive
through here with all the smoke
and all the problems associated
with that, it doesn't leave a good
taste in your mouth —— pardon
the pun.”

Once the Dauphinees took a
second look at Pittsburgh, a city

which has changed much since.

the days of the steel mills, they
got a new perspective.

“The hospital brought us both
[to Pittsburgh], and we came in
on a nice, clear, pretty day,” he
said. “It was late fall, and the
leaves were still on the trees, but
they had changed and it was

I really nice. Everybody we met

was extremely friendly.”

It was tough for Dauphinee
and his wife to get used to their
new lives: in school, in a different
_job, in a different city. To make
matters worse, Mrs. Dauphinee
tcre ligaments in her knee while
skiing.

“Getting Joan back and forth to
work was a challenge,”
Dauphinee said. “I don’t know if
you know what it’s like at home
without a lady who knows what
the hell is supposed to happen as
far as when the dishes get done,
when the food gets cooked, how
you make a meal all finish at the
same time so you can eat potatoes
and meat and a vegetable all
warm at the same time.

“All of a sudden, I was having
to do it all. She had crutches and
[had] some mobility, but even on
crutches you can’t do much. You
definitely don’t do anything in
the kitchen because notice how
many times you turn [while
cooking]. If you have a screwed-
up knee, you don’t make turns.
Plus, how the hell do you vacuum
on crutches or make a bed while
you’re on cmtches?”

Dauphinee said that his wife
couldn't do laundry, but she

coached him through it. He said,
“She explained to me, ‘No, you
can’t wash these together — you
have to separate.’ I didn't screw
up much, although I had a couple
of pink undershins.”

Despite all of the extra stress,
Dauphinee says that he has
adjusted well to the life of being
a student. “I had been challenged
severely in ﬂight school,” he said,
“but it was a long time between
ﬂight school and my first day
here. Learning how to study
again plus coping with problems
at home kept me busy.”

Dauphinee has had no
problems with fitting in or making
friends. “Surprisingly, there are a
lot of older students, and a lot of
us tend to congregate [together].
Pretty soon, you look around and
you’ve got a variety of friends.
You just sort of get folded right
in," he said.

When asked if he feels that he
and his older classmates use their
experience in life to try to help
younger students with their lives,
Dauphinee said, “I’m not sure
who’s taking care of whom.
Sometimes, I think the younger
folks are taking care of us. You
really become just a student.
You're not older; you’re not
younger. You're just a student.”

Dauphinee said, however, that
his relationship with his professors
is different. “I think the professors
tend to treat the older students
differently in that when you go in
for help, it’s really a [one-on—one]
discussion.” he said. “I hear some
of the students talk about
professors being arrogant, and I
don’t see the same situation at all.
Maybe it's how [professors]
perceive me.”

The Dauphinees live near North
Park and collaborate their
schedules so they can commute
to Pitt together, which they both
enjoy. “She's my wife, but she’s
my best friend,” he said.

He and his wife presently work
together, recruiting instructors to
provide medical seminars.

Dauphinee doesn't have the
chance to participate in any
extracurricular activities, nor does
he feel that they offer much to
him. “Student government could
use some help," he said, “Student
government is a great thing to
have on your resume, but not
when you’re 45.”

Sometimes Dauphinee will go
to a campus bar and have a beer
after class. He doesn't try to meet
girls because he said he thinks
his wife “would frown upon it.”

Dauphinee loves basketball but
hasn't had the chance to catch a

game. He said, “You get down to
making a choice: Do I go home
and cook dinner and study, or do
I go to the ball game? Basically,
there's no decision there. Plus,
my wife doesn't care a thing in
the world about basketball. It’s
kind of a dull life, but I have to
study. I have to keep up with the
young students.” I
One activity that Dauphinee
wants to get involved with is
Pitt's science fair, which he
believes is a weak program which
suffers from student apathy.
“Last year, the science fair was
held over in the chemistry
building. I was totally ashamed
that there was not a single judge
from this university that was
involved. There should be
graduate students and chemistry
and biology majors standing in
line to get involved.”
Dauphinee states that he is
doing well at Pitt, estimating his
grade—point average to be about
3.3. He claims that being older
has a lot to do with his success.
“When I got out of high school,
if I had gone straight to college,
I would have graduated, but I
would have screwed off. I would
have come out of there with a
degree, but I don’t know if it
would have gotten me into a
highly competitive [graduate]
school. I would have been too
footloose and fancy free.
“[My age] gives me an edge
because I can sit down in a
course and I know what I have to

walk out of there with forever.
The rest of the stuff I know I have
to look at until the exam is over.
Once the exam is over, I can flush
it because it’s useless
information."

Dauphinee believes that a lot
of what Pitt is trying to teach
students is worthless information.
“They tell you, ‘What if you’re
stuck on an elevator, and you
need to know the cosine of )2?’
Hey, if I'm stuck on an elevator,
I need to know how to get the
hell out of the elevator.”

Again, Dauphinee believes his
age to be an asset. “I think I'm

treated more as somebody
special. When [professors] ask a
question, they look at me. When
there are students in the class that
have questions after class,
frequently they’ll come in ask me
about it. That's probably because
I'm older."

Although the Vietnam War was
a horrid ordeal and had a large
impact on Dauphinee’s life, he
has tried to put the bad memories
behind him.

“I basically flushed Vietnam
when I got back,” he said. “It’s
not usually a subject that I bring
up. I buried a lot of good friends,
a lot of guys who were right there
beside me  it was their turn and
not mine. You can’t dwell on
that, or it will drive you nuts. It’s
all behind me; it’s history. I can’t
change it. My philosophy is
basically to worry about the things
I can change.”

Pigs
Continued from page 3
into the Jacuzzi.

“Pigs are totally relaxed and
hedonistic," she says. “They’re
extremely docile —— the couch-
potato type.”

Closer to home, potbelly
breeder Richard Reigleman,
owner of Pymatuning Deer Park
near Jamestown, Pa., has also
been peddling his popular piglets
on a national level.

Reigelman, who has been
breeding potbellies sincejanuary,
claims that the average sow can

produce two or three litters
annually, providing anywhere
between five to 11 pigs per litter.

“I think it’s a good investment,”
he says. “When they have 16 to 18
babies a year, you don’t have to
wait around too long to get your
money back.”

Today, according to a Pet Pad
estimate, the potbellies’ ever-
growing population has exceeded
6,000 from coast to coast.
However, ownership is illegal in
some cities.

In fact, harboring one of these

beasties could get you a $200
fine. Certain municipalities -
New York City being one — have
laws forbidding residents from
keeping hooved animals such as
goats, horses, and — yes, pigs as
domestic pets.

“It’s just one of those blue laws
that has existed forever,” one Pet
Pad customer explains matter-of-
factly.

“The ordinance doesn't ask me
to smell them," says William
Armstrong, chief of animal
regulation and ‘care in Houston.

“A pig is a pig.”

At any rate, if you’re interested
in owning one of these bright
and affectionate pets, be prepared
to shell out somewhere in the
neighborhood of $1,500 for a
five-week-old, pure-bred piglet
(one prized sow reportedly sold
for $34,000).

But fear not, for this hog-sized
expenditure is expected to drop
as soon as supply catches up
with demand, which should take
a few years at most.

Blatz to travel abroad to train with pro soccer teams

By Sean. Hellman
Staff Writer

Mike Blatz, a Pitt junior and a member_ of the soccer team, is making
plans to train with several Division l‘European club teams this
summer. ~

The plans were made with the help of Pitt head soccer coach Joe
Luxbacher and Robert Morris head soccer coach John Kowalski.
Kowalski is active in international soccer and is able to help Blatz
through his International Soccer Federation connections.

“The purpose of the trip is to get to a higher [soccer- playing] level,”
said Blatz. Blatz is a physical-education major who wishes to play
soccer professionally and coach either in the United States or in
Europe. He hopes to make soccer connections which would beneﬁt
him in the future.

“It will be a total learning experience,” he said. “I’m going there
with the thought of having a good showing. And maybe I will catch
someone’s, eye and get invited back."

NCAA rules prohibit Blatz from wearing a professional club team’s I

jersey or participating with the professionals in any way. But he is
permitted to watch practices and train with reserve squads. Blatz has
one year of college-soccer eligibility remaining.

Blatz’s tentative plans are to leave on May 8 for England, where he
will train with the Bournemouth reserve club until the end of May.
From there he will go to Holland, where plans are not clear at the
present time.

Kowalski has contacted three clubs for Blatz to train with in
Holland: Ajax, Maastricht and Volendam. He will most likely train
with the Ajax reserve squad. The other teams are located in cities that
are a considerable distance from Amsterdam, where Blatz will stay
until about the middle of June.

Blatz will reside with families of friends who are, or were, Pitt
students. He will stay with Mr. and Mrs. Neil Riding, uncle and aunt
of Blatz’s former roommate, Chris Riding, in Bournemouth, England;
and Jan and Peggy Pepr, parents of Pitt student Isabella Pepr, in
Amsterdam. '

Plans are not yet certain for Blatz because the club teams involved

A quick scan of Paul Hackett’s
office reveals a lot about the man.

Everything is organized and

Sports Editor

Bob Smizik, now a columnist for the Pittsburgh Press, was a
sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh when Bill Mazeroski
hit his famous home run in the bottom of the ninth inning in the
final game of the 1960 World Series. Sofon, Smizik started writing
about sports and became sports editor of The Pitt News.

All that remains of Forbes Field, where Mazeroski hit his
dipger, is part of the brick outﬁeld wall and a home plate
preserved in the floor of Forbes Quadrangle.

But Smizik is still in Pittsburgh and is still doing his thing. He
has been working for the Pittsburgh Press since 1969 and was
named a Top-10 sports columnist in 1988 by the Associated
Press. His most recent endeavor is the book The Pittsburgh
Pirates: An Illustrated History, edited by Gerald Astor.

The Pittsburgh Pirates could be enjoyed by all baseball fans,
not just Pirate followers. Names from Alley to Zisk and Jacob

However, a glance to the far
right wall reveals that the
occupant of this office has added
a few personal touches of
decoration. Framed neatly are
several clippings from local
newspapers detailing the
University of Pittsburgh’s football
program from mid—December of
1989 to the beginning of this new
decade. And the centerpiece of
this menage has a simple
headline: “Pitt Names Hackett as
New Head Coach.”

It is obvious that Hackett indeed

does take pride in that collection.
As well he should, for it describes
the end of over one decade of
frustration for the 42-year-old
native of Vermont.

“It’s been somewhat
frustrating,” Hackett said. “When
you see yourself as a head coach,
and it really doesn’t happen as
quickly as you wantit to — that's
frustration.”

In the 1980s, Hackett has been
mentioned as a candidate for
some of the most prestigious

head—coaching jobs in the country. ‘

But certain twists of fate have
prevented him from sitting in

 
  
   
  
 
  
 
   
 
 
      

bookstore

California as the man in charge of
the Stanford or St. Louis Cardinals.

And certain twists of fate have
also brought him to the upper
echelon of Pitt's program. In fact,
Hackett’s entire life has been one
big twist of fate.

On June 5, 1947, Paul Hackett
was born in Burlington,» Vt. His
father was a biochemistry
professor, so it just seemed correct
in the overall scheme of things
that Paul should have his eyes
glued to a book as soon as he was
able to read.

A funny thing happened,
though, when Hackett saw that

. buff.

about it.

his childhood friends were not
exactly striving to be the next
Albert Einstein. .

Hackett’s friends were
immersed in tossing the old
pigskin around. And for some
reason, Hackett himself one day
became upset with the fact that
his buddies were getting a lot

as they say, is history.

Q: What made you decide to write The Pittsburgh Pirates

—An Illustrated History?

It wasn't really a decision of mine. Walker Publishing came to
 the realization that nothing had been written about the Pirates in
‘ a long time. The last history of the Pirates was written in about
1948. They felt the market would be prime, or at least as prime 5’
' as that type of market would be.

' Q: Did you come across any problems in writing the

It was ‘very difficult to research the early years because there
was so little written and no oneis still alive. The 1938 team was
_ kind of famous because they almost won the pennant. Writing
about them was easy because you can find a dozen guys that are
/‘ still alive. But {with} anything before that [I was] really in trouble,
 so it was very difficult. Consequently, the early text may tend to
be a little dry, unfortunately, but there wasn't much I could do V‘

was always a sports fan, though.

“I guess the competition with
my friends who were already
playing is what really drew me
in.”

Hackett’s family eventually
moved to California where his
father took a job at Cal-Berkeley.
Hackett had a good enough high-
school career to be offered an
opportunity to play football at
the University of California—Davis.
It was there that he blossomed
into a solid quarterback and
eventually went on!’ to lead the
Far Western Conference in
passing in 1969.

Once again, he did not follow
in his father’s footsteps
academically while at Cal-Davis.
“When I got to college, I guess I
really wasn’t like the rest of my
family in that I wasn’t a serious
student,” he said.

“I was a good student but not
a serious one — and there is a
difference. It’s hard to say what
exactly got me going [with
football]. Certainly, there wasn’t

a lot of inﬂuence at home.”

Hackett was not exactly sure
what good his fondness with
football would do him after his
college career was over. He was
an above-average college
quarterback, but the pros were
not exactly drooling over the
thought of his lining up behind
their center.

But just when it looked like
Hackett was through with
football, longtime UC—Davis
Coach Jim Sochor asked him to
try coaching Davis’ freshman
team.

The 1970 and ’7l UC—Davis
frosh teams went undefeated
when Hackett was around to help
them out. More importantly for
Hackett, he discovered that he
had found, in Chuck Noll’s words,
his “life’s work.”

“When you’re 20 or 21 years
old and something that positive
happens to you, well  “ was
how Hackett described to the
San Francisco Examiner his
decision to go fully into coaching

For the next four years, Hackett

assisted Mike White at UC-
Berkeley. It was there that Hackett
would coach his first bona fide
superstar —— a man by the name
of Steve Bartkowski. Bartkowski
was the NCAA’s leading passer in
1974 and would go on to have a
long and distinguished career with
the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons.

Hackett then went to work for
current Los Angeles Rams head
coach John Robinson, who hired
him as an assistant at the
University of Southern California
in 1976.

It was there that Hackett was a
part of one of the powerhouse
college football programs of the
19703. The Trojans won the ’77
Astro Bluebonnet Bowl and the
’76, ’78 and ’79 Rose Bowls. That
final Rose Bowl triumph
culminated a national-
championship year for USC.

Hackett left USC in 1980,
knowing that he had put his
personal touches on two signal
callers who would have a solid,
albeit unspectacular, pro Career

in Vince Evans and Paul
McDonald.

In 1981, Hackett inquired about
a job with the Cleveland Browns.
That was the year after Cleveland
quarterback Brian Sipe threw that
infamous interception late in a
first—round playoff game against
the Oakland Raiders to blow
Cleveland’s chance of advancing
to the ’80 AFC Championship
game. Hackett found himself
wondering what life would be
like on the other side of coaching.

What would it be like to think
only about football all day? How
would it feel to ask Sipe how his
new investment had gone rather
than whether or not he had gone
to geology class? What would it
feel like to have the players beg
you for a spot on the team, rather
than having to travel halfway
across the country to convince
his parents that you were the
greatest thing since the invention
of the dollar bill?

“I think I was just curious about
what pro football was about,”
Hackett said.

13

 

The head coach for the Browns
at the time was Sam Rutigliano
(currently the coach at Liberty
University in Virginia). Rutigliano
ended up hiring Hackett and
laughed when asked to describe
Hackett’s attitude back then.

“[Hackett] was amazed when
he got here that all he had to do
was turn the projector on and
off,” Rutigliano said. “He had to
work on football and football
only. In college, you have to
worry about kids’ grades,
recruiting and all that other stuff.

“He just couldn’t get over the
fact that we would actually play
four exhibition games and 16
regular-season games.”

Both Rutigliano and Sipe seem
amazed that Hackett looks at life
in general, and football in
particular, with a fiery state of
euphoria. Hackett enjoys drawing
plays as much as his father enjoys
examining the molecular
composition of an element.

“My experience with him is
both funny and interesting,”

Rutigliano said. “He's just a
tremendous guy with tremendous
energy. When I was interviewing
him for the job, we’d literally talk
for hours. There came a time
whenl had to say, ‘This is enough,
Paul.’

“He was just so enthusiastic

 

‘ when discussing football strategy.

He would have drawn a diagram
on~my shirt if I would have let
him,” Rutigliano said.

“He was just an intensely .
committed man,” Sipe said. “His
energy was verymuch focused
on the game of football. I consider
him an overachiever type of guy. ”

In/1983, Hackett was given a

. chance of a lifetime, at least in his

opinion. _He had the opportunity
to work with the creme de la
creme of football coaches. This
was the man whose name many

have attached the adjective

“genius” to — Bill Walsh.

“Next to Jim Sochor, the man
who inﬂuenced the most was
Walsh,” Hackett said. “This [job]
was a very attractive thing, and it

was a real step up for me.”

Walsh just happened to be
looking for a quarterback coach
at the time, and he had
remembered the assistant from
UC-Berkeley who had visited the
Cincinnati Bengals training camp
while Walsh was an assistant
there. Hackett only had to take a
cross-country ﬂight to become
part of Walsh’s crew.

“He was considered to be one
of the brightest and most capable
coaches in football,” said Walsh,
now an announcer for NBC. “He
had a very inquisitive mind, was
creative, totally dedicated to what
he did and had a reputation of
being an outstanding teacher.

"There was every reason to be
excited about hiring Paul," said
Walsh. g

Of course, vHackett’s new job
entailed working with a
quarterback named Joe Montana
—— a Joe Montana who was a
good player but who had yet to
put up numbers like those during
this past NFL season.

“He had a very signiﬁcant role

here,” Walsh said. “Paul worked .

very closely with Joe and was
very instrumental in his
development. He was joe’s
personal tutor.

“He did an excellent job in
sustaining what we had
developed — the Cutting edge of
pro football. He learned a lot,
and he contributed a lot. It was
one of those experiences which
has probably had the most impact
on his career."

Hackett was 36 at the time, and

as. the season progressed, he

began to show the first signs of
irritation at being labelled as a
“candidate” for several prominent
college head-coaching jobs. In
’85, Hackett was mentioned for
the third time as a prospect to
become Stanford’s coach. In ’77,

I Walsh had gotten the job over

him, And in 1980, Paul Wiggin
was awarded the position.

At the time, Hackett was totally
fed up with the college prospects,

indicated. “It’s not like Stanford

Continued from page 14
doesn’t know about me, ” he said.
“I've been to the table twice. And
they [didn't choose me]. That's
ﬁne.

“I was disappointed. I made
that obvious to Andy Geiger
[Stanford's athletic director] and
to everyone involved with Paul
Hackett. I thought I was the ideal
guy -for the job. They talked to me
twice and in a very positive vein.
I think they had the feeling that I
was the guy to fit the bill there,
and both times I wasn't”

Hackett remained at San
Francisco for the next three years
and continued to grit his teeth as _
he was bypassed for job after job. ‘
In 1986, when the St. Louis
Cardinals ﬁred Jim Hanifan (and

you-know-who was tabbed as,‘

his likely replacement), Hackett
gave the impression that there
quite possibly was a better chance
of hell's freezing over than his

becoming a head coach at the
college level.

“More and more in college
football, head coaches are
becoming administrators,"
Hackett said. “When John
Robinson was at USC, he always
used to say he wished he had
more time for coaching."

Hackett, in effect, seemed
haunted by the fact that he could
not reach the top of his profession.
He had “paid his dues" one too
many times than his personality
could take.

“There's a lot of guys who are
assistants who say they want to
become head coaches,”
Rutigliano said. “Then they ﬁnd
out they're just content being an
assistant.

“But there are some guys who
just have that drive to experience
everything. Paul always lives life
in the left lane. He always wanted
to be a head coach."

“I think there’s always
frustration in coaches who are
ambitious,” former Dallas Coach
Tom Landry said. “Most assistant
coaches should be ambitious to

be a head coach, and sometimes .

it becomes frustrating for them. I
know it did for Dan Reeves [the
current Denver Bronco coach]
when he was coaching for me.

“I think that [it's] natural for
people who are very competitive
to want to reach the top," Landry
said.

In '86, Hackett decided to add
to his resume by gaining
experience under another living
legend in Landry. He had seen
the most proliﬁc offense in the
history of the game rise, and now
it was time to see what the man
who developed the ﬂex defense
had to say.

Who could forget ﬂamboyant -
. Jerry Jones’ buying Dallas after

the ’88 season and firing Landry
immediately? Most of Landry's
staff, including Hackett, was also
axed, but Hackett says he will
always remember how the
staunch Landry dealt with being
kicked out of the house that he
had built.

“My time in Dallas was very
valuable,”-Hackett said. “I'll never
forget how [Landry] handled the

adversity. The way it happened »

was just an unfortunate thing.”
It was not time for Paul Hackett

to re-evaluate his own life. He
had gained all the experience
that he could by becoming the
Larry Brown of assistant football
coaches. Perhaps it was time that
he settled down.

Hackett had a good relationship
with Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried and became Gottfried's
offensive coordinator to start the
1989 season. No longer was
becoming a college coach taboo
with Hackett -"he even bought
a house in Pittsburgh when he

Q: Forbes Field plays a big
part in the history of the
Pirates. Were you sad to see it
go?

Not as much as most people
seemed to be. When I went to

' Pitt, it was terriﬁc; it was right

there. But it was a little outdated.
What a lot of people tend to
forget is that the Steelers didn’t
have a place to play. They were
playing in Pitt Stadium at the
time which was far from ideal. If
they wanted to keep the Steelers
here, they would have had to go
to a multi—purpose park, which
they did. You have to understand
that the time, had come. There
were a lot of problems with
Forbes Field: People had to sit
behind pillars; it was dirty, [and]
there were things like that which
people have to remember. I have
no problem with Three Rivers.

Q: What about the Pirates of
today — what kind of team
are they? A

I have mixed feeling about
them. Like anyone else, some
days I'm high on them, and some
days rm not. But the potential is
there. They have a good nucleus,
not the perfect nucleus. They’re
at least one, maybe two players
away from being what I would
consider a serious pennant

contender. They’re - especially .

missing many a big hitter. They
need someone to bat ﬁfth or
sixth who can really do some
damage.

Q: Why has the Pirate"

attendance been so low?
These last couple years, it’s

picked up. But by and large, the
problem is, I think, this town
demands a winner. It was spoiled
in the ’70s, and it’s not ready to go
out to the ball park unless there's
a winning team. Population is a
fa’ctor, too. It’s not the biggest
market in baseball; it’s not the
smallest, either. You just have to

do a dynamite job of marketing a ‘

team. They do a pretty good job,
but there's room for improvement
there too. I think Pittsburgh could
support baseball, but right now
it’s touch and go, as far as I'm
concerned.

Q: Why isn’t there an NBA
basketball team in Pittsburgh?
Probably the biggest reason at
point is the size of the market. I
don’t know that this town could
subsidize four teams. There’s a
question whether they could back
three teams, considering the
support the Pirates get. I think if
there was an NBA team in town,
they wouldn’t have the same fans
the Penguins do, but they’d be
ifighting for the same dates and
the same dollars. I don’t think it
would work out. Especially if
you consider that the team that
would come in here would be an
expansion team. Expansion teams

lose and lose and lose, and I 3

don’t see Pittsburgh backing a
team like that.

p Q: So Pittsburgh doesn’t
have a basketball team. But
whydo theyjump into allthese
other sports leagues like the
USFL, Arena Football and the
Majorlndoorlacrosse League?

A lot of that has to do with the
DeBartolos and the Civic Arena.

Civic Arena is interested in just
getting events into the building
so their investment isn't wasted.
So anytime something like that
does come along, and it’s to their
credit, they want to put people in
the building. _They are very active
in that respect, so that explains
the arena-football and the lacrosse
teams. As far as the [USFLl Maulers
are concerned, I think at one time
they thought spring football was
a legitimate business opportunity.
It proved not to be.

Q: What do you think the
Steelers should look for in the
upcoming draft? .

That’s a tough question. Their
greatest need is a pass rusher, be
it a defensive end or an outside

‘linebacker. They could also use
another wide receiver. Some of
the guys they feel are really good
at those positions could be gone
[by their pick]. One of those
three positions should be their
first pick: linebacker, defensive

end or wide receiver.

Q: WhatPitt football players
do you think will go in the
upcoming draft?

Spindler’s going to go high, not
first but definitely second round.
Caliguire, Matutz and Goetz are
all being talking about; I’m sure
they’ll all get drafted. Hampton
was a disappointment, buthe’s
still going_to get drafted. Pitt will
have its share, I guess. I don’t pay

too much attention to that because

it’s such a crap-shoot: the opinions
are so wide and varied this year.

Like Jeff George, some people:

projected him a second rounder
and the Falcons are ready to take
[him] as the first overall pick. It’s
really a guessing game.

Q: You’re known as a
columnist who’s not afraid to

speak his mind. Does writing

controversial things ever

worry you? s
There may have been times

when I was hesitant to write

17

 

things‘ because you know it’s
going to stir things up. But I kind
of have the duty and the
responsibility [to] write those
things; that's what they pay me

for. People like opinions, and by L

and large, you have to write
what's on your mind.

Q: Did you ever have any
problems after you -wrote
something controversial?

I had to have ‘my phone
disconnected when I picked the
Steelers to lose once. ‘People send
me mail, but I’ve never been
physically confronted or attacked.

[When] ‘I covered the Pirates for »

six years in the ’70s, I had a lot of
verbal confrontations with the
players, but when you cover a
team every day, you’re going to
run into those kinds of things.
Those are more like family feuds
than anything else. By and large,
I have seen that most athletes,
particularly professionals, have

an understanding of what my job‘ A

is about, and they respect that.
