FBI Charter Would Strengthen Agency, Director Claims,

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer .
FBI Director William H. Webster
said Friday that the bureau’s

proposed charter would strengthen I

the agency by clearly outlining_ its

powers and duties, and by giving‘ it.

the use of administrative subpoena

to request records of individuals"
from banks and other ﬁnancial.

institutions. .

“It (the charter) tells us what is
expected of us.
that is not certain of its mission is
going to exceed permissible
bounds because it doesn’t know
what they are, or it is going to
perceive bounds that aren’t there

and hold back,” said Webster

during an interview. ~ A .

* “In that sense we can better
train and discipline our, special
agents in connection with their
mission with a clearer understand-
ing of our jurisdiction.” -

Defending the proposed use of
administrative subpoenas bythe
FBI, Webster said the power was

essential to the investigation of

white collar and organized crime.

He pointed out that if such:

Any organization A‘

subpoenas were resisted by a bank,
the bureau still must go to court to
compel the release of any informa-
tion. . ‘
‘‘It’s not -enforceable. If the
' person honors it, that’s fine. We
still have to ‘go to court to compel
compliance. '__.Much has been made
of this as some kind of enormous
power that shouldn't‘-be given to an
agency as strong as the FBI. I have
_said that is "foolishness when it is
routinely available to other investi-
gative agencies,” the director said,
adding that 50 to 60 other federal
agencies -and all 14 ’ inspector
generals have the power to use
such subpeonas.
In a speech to niembers of the
Pitt Law School Alumni Association
Friday night, Webster said prov-
isions for the use of informants and
undercover agents were essential
for the effective investigation of
white collar crime, organized crim
and corruption among public
officials. - . .

    Steelers Raise Funds q
  Forlglniured Gymnast

By DEBBIE MARTIN

Approximately 600 people,
members of the Pittsburgh
Steelers ..football team, and
other local personalities were
on hand for a Tom Cardamone
Sports Night held Friday
evening at Castle Shannon
Memorial Fire ‘Hall-

The event, sponsored by the
Tom Cardamone Fund, was an
effort to raise money to buy a _
specially equipped van for the I
former Pitt gymnast, who has
been paralyzed since he fell
from the rings during a team" -
practice seven years ago‘, his '
parents said. 1-

“We were in the hospital
with him _seven years ago
tonight,” Mr. Cardamone said.
He added that the event had
not been planned to coincide
with the anniversary of his
son’s accident.

Cardamone, now 28, could
not attend the beneﬁt due to an
infection he has had for the last
few weeks. Cardamone was
admitted to a hospital last
Tuesday and is undergoing
tests to determine if he has a
urological problem. ,

“I just wish Tom was here,”
his mother Margaret said. “I
can’t believe all the people.”

Both of Cardamone’s sisters-,
Chris and Debbis, also ex-
pressed regret that he couldn’t
be present. ‘

“‘As long as we’re all
thinking about him,” Debbie_

said. “That’s why we’re all
here.” . '
Autographed gports items

were donated by the Steelers,
Penguins and Pirates were
raffled and there were ivionie
Carlo games like blackjack and
poker. —

Steelers Willie Fry and Ted

Peterson volunteered their

services as dealers at the card‘
table and signed autographs.

Other personalities included
WIIC sportscaster Bill Currie
and Ted White of KDKA’s I
Evening Magazine. Rex
Gatto’,s Music Factory provided
entertainment. .

The Cardamones would not
comment on the ‘negligence
lawsuit they have ﬁled against
the university. Mrs. Carda-
mone saying that sherbelieved
“Pitt is a good school.”

She added that her son is
active, coaching a junior varsity
football team at the St. Anne ,
school in Castle Shannon. Also
he is working on a master's in
education at Pitt, and is a
teaching assistant ‘in -the
Graduate School of Education ‘
here.

Mrs. Cardamone said that in
the future he hopes to teach or
go into “administrative
duties.”

Debbie Vasilopus, Carda-
mone’s ﬁancee. said that they
plan to marry “early next year,
maybe in March.”

“Tom enjoys life. He has
great . determination. That’s
why we’re all here,” said

A Christian response to nuclear
proliferation was the subject of a
presentation Tuesday night at
Bellefield Presbyterian Church.
The presentation was part of a
Tuesday night lecture/ﬁlm series
being held at the church during the
month of October by the Christian
Peacemakers, a. Pittsburgh-based
anti-nuclear group. .

Films included in the series are
“Wargames” and
Nagasaki,” ' which were formerly
banned in the United States.

The presentations are being held
in order to help “God’s people seek

Borger, a spokesman for the
Peacemakers.
In the ’presentation,’ Borger

spoke of how the original goodness
of God’s creation was radically
altered by humans, as evidenced
by the pollution of the environment
and‘ the nuclear arms ’ race.

The Peaeemakers see active
involvement in bringing biblical
values of peace, justice and love
into political and economic issues
as a vital part of the Christian faith,
said Borger.

“Because we’re called to love,-

The Pitt/Oakland YMCA cele-
brated the International Year of the
Child at a carnival held in the
Student Union Ballroom Saturday.

Enthusiastic youngters from
various racial and ethnic- groups
attended the event, acknowledging
the importance of children.

“Children are special because
they never get a chance to do
anything because they're small,”
said 12-year-old Tshidi Makhanda,
whose mother is majoring in

-Library Science here and whose
father is employed by the United
Nations. The UN last year
proclaimed 1979 to be the year in

* ‘Year, of the Child
Celebrated by YMCA

which the potential of children as
the world’s future leaders and
citizens-' was to be highlighted.
Proceeds from Saturday's carni-
val will benefit YMCA World
Service programs, but though the
event was a fund-raiser there was a
good deal of fun raised also.
Groups like Mobilization for
Survival, the Hunger Action
Coalition and the United Nations
Association of Pittsburgh displayed «
arts, crafts, and books for adult
viewer appreciation and children
had a mirade of games that they

- could participate in.

The occasion prompted insight-
from
children.
“President Carter is risking their

Miss Makhanda.

“It feels good to have a whole

youngster Ghada Ismail.

Census Bureau Report Shows Taxes Gobbling Money‘

- WASHINGTON—’—If you have the
feeling that taxes are gobbling up
more and more of your‘ money, a
new Census Bureau report shows
vividly that you are right.

The 643-page “Compendium of
Government Finances,” released
Sunday, discloses that between
1971 and 1977, taxes collected by
all forms of government in this
country increased by 59.4 percent.

And collections from income
taxes—individual and corporate—
climbed an enormous 70.6 percent.
0 The income tax collections were
pushed upward primarily by the
jump in Americans’ personal

_ income over the same period.

With income rising 78 percent,
Americans paid taxes on more

money and also edged into higher
tax.brackets, meaning they paid a
larger share of their increased
income.

During the same period, the
Consumer Price Index, measuring
the price of the goods and services
you buy, increased 45.4 percent,
about the same as the increase in
sales tax receipts 45.5 percent and
property tax income 45.8 percent.

During the past two.years the
inflation rate has increased sharply
to where it now stands at more than
13 percent a year.

Overall, income taxes in 19.77
contributed $250 billion toward
government operations, compared
to $146.5 billion in ﬁscal 1971.

The total income of all govern-

l

up 72 percent from the $382.8
billion of five years earlier.
During the same period, expend-
itures of all governments in the
United States grew 71 percent from
$399.1 billion to $682.2 billion
Government debt jumped 61
percent, from $602.4 billion to
$968.8 billion. ,
Spending for public welfare and
education were two of the most
costly areas of state spending.
The states were divided into
groups according to how much they
spend on education and welfare for
every $1,000 of income earned by
residents of the state.
Eight states, for example, had

the lowest rates of spending for’

welfare programs, at less than $15

ments was $657.5 billion in 1977, for every $1,000 of personal
‘/

income. These. were Alaska,
Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, Ne-
braska, Indiana, North Carolina
and Florida. _,

p Spending more than $25 on
welfare for everv $1,000 of personal
income were California, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois,

‘ Kentucky, the District of Columbia,

Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Maine. The rest of the states fell in
between those two figures.

FBI Charter

 _ Ominous Threat

William H. Webster, the director of the FBI, seems
to view the proposed charter to regulate the domestic
duties of the agency as the single step that can ensure
the end of civil rights abuses by the FBI and build the
conﬁdence of agents. He correctly blames the cause
of past abuses like surveillance of Martin Luther
King, Jr. and spying on the left-wing Socialist
Workers Party on the’lack of any written charter that
delineated the duties and restricted the powers of the
bureau. ,

The director is correct when he asserts the need for

a charter, but his unqualified support -of every p

section of the document is disturbing. If it is
accepted by Congress as, it now stands, the charter
"would pose a ominous threat to civil rights by making
legitimate the surveillance of protest groups, and the
requesting of bank records, telephone logs and other
records from third parties without a subpoena
approved in court. ‘ i V
The most disturbing of these two measures is the
charter’s granting of an ‘administrative subpoena

power to the FBI, which the agency could use to-

’ request information from third parties without going
to court. An administrative subpoena would allow
the FBI free access to any individual’s bank or
financial records, even though the institution with
the documents can refuse to release them and the
subject of the demand must be notified of the

administrative subpoena under most circumstances.‘

Unless the request is absolutely outrageous, banks
A and other institutions, which have always been
willing to help the FBI and are subject to federal
.inspection, cannot be expected to be the selfless

defenders of their clients, especially when the charter.
protects‘ these institutions against legal ‘ action.

Provisions requiring notification of the party being

investigated can be evaded if the United States I‘
Although the ,

attorney general approves a delay.
party must be told eventually, the damage might be

done by the end of the 90-day delay. Such a clause
could help catch a guilty white-collar criminal, but it
could also result in the possibility of unnecessarily
invading a citizen’s- privacy. Forcing the bureau to
go to the courts could add an extra check to prevent
such encroachments.  A '

In response to thesearguments, the director says
50 to 60 agencies and the 14 inspectors general have
the power to use‘ administrative subpoenas, and
complains that the FBI should ‘have the power if
everyone else does."_ Perhaps he should consider
instead _that no agency should have the right to
invade confidential "records without the check of
overview by the courts;

The other segment] of the charter that must send

— chills down the spineof every civil libertarian is the

power of _ the FBIW"to collect information about
peaceful public assemblies when the federal
government may have to help “facilitate the

demonstration or to provide public health ‘and safety '

measures with respect thereto.” Even though
approval of the U.S. attorney general. is_ needed to
collect any information in such cases and can include
only information like news reports, the chilling effect
of knowing the FBI watching seems an unnecessary
discouragement that might dampen the eagerness of
possible dissidents. - -

Enactment of some charter to outline the
responsibilities of the FBI is needed as soon as
possible. However Congress should not approve
without amendment the proposed charter if it allows
the bureau to demand confidential records without
checks by the judiciary and to keep tabs on peaceful
protestors-. Although there are administrative
controls on these , two measures, they. are
unacceptable because their existance further allows
government encroachment on privacy and
discouragement of dissent. ' '

Letters

Letter ’Wi’rless and Wildly Inaccurate’ Toward Reader

There is much to commend. in
Mr. Douglas Barber's recent letter
(October 17th) in the Pitt News.
Mr. Barber writes well and has
much to say about our maddening
desires to discover scapegoais

' behind every problem. Thus. I was

especially amazed to find in Mr.
Barber’s letter a witless and wildly
inaccurate reference to me in which
I was purported by him to have
defended remarks made by my
colleague. Richard Cottam. con-
cerning the political situation in
Iran shortly after the occurrence of

’ the revolution there last winter.

While I fail to
scintilla‘s worth

discern one
of connection

between Mr. ‘Barber’s principle

thesis and anything that either
C0118”! 0.1‘ I are reputed to have

said. Mr. Barber’s misreading of

what either of us did say is too
grave to let pass.

To quote from Mr. Barber’s
letter. he claims that l defended “a
statement by Professor Cottam to
the effect that the Ayatollah
Khomeini was an Iranian Martin
Luther King." Employing a phrase
such as “to the effect" is an
especially clever device for over-
coming whatever faint impulse Mr.
Barber might have felt to report
accurately what either Cottom or I
did say. Among other things. it
would advance Mr. Barber’s
education greatly if he would learn
to distinguish between positive
statements meant to describe an
empirical condition and normative
statements which set forth one's
preferences. As I have discovered
in recent‘ times. Mr. Barber's

disability here seems to be one that
is widely shared. For. myself. all
that I in fact did was to defend a

' notion that seems to be in danger of

becoming quaintly old—fashioned.
namely that it is worthwhile to
know whereof one speaks before

one does so. Qualiﬁcations, as I
hope Mr. Barber is discovering
during his university education. are
neither randomly distributed or
directly transferable from one ﬁeld
of knowledge to another. I trust
that Mr. Barber would

n01~

seriously quarrel with the validity
of these notions.

Panthers Collarﬂuskies, Win 26-14

Piﬁ Gets '

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

,SEATTLE—The skeptics’ will
point out that four of Pitt’s scores

came as direct results of Washing-._
"ton turnovers.

The optimists will say the‘
Panthers went into a tough road
game against a quality opponent
and came out victorius.

But the skeptic will counter by
saying Washington isn't that good
a team, that they had beaten up on ,
some weak sisters.

But whatever anyone says, the
fact does remain that the Pitt
Panthers won probably their
biggest game since the 1977
conquest of Clemson in the Gator
Bowl. By defeating the Washing-
ton Huskies, 26-14, Pitt beat a team
that had been ranked ahead. of
them, and the Panthers showed
some character, coming up with
aggressive defensive plays to cause
three fumbles and three intercept-
ions.

The first break occurred in the
first quarter when Husky tailback
Joe Steele fumbled on his own 38
after he had run 10 yards for a first
down. Ricky Jackson recovered,
and Randy McMillan ran the
Panthers to paydirt, scoring from
one yard out to give the Panthers a
7-0 lead.

It was unusual to see another
team play give away the way the
Huskies did. Early in the year, Pitt
continuously killed itself with
turnovers, but the shoe was on the
other foot in Saturday’s game.

“I think we played well today,”
said Pitt quarterback Rick Trocano.
“But Washington killed itself.
They made, what? Six_,or seven
turnovers? We didn’t make any.”
Washington’s coach Don James,

   

Big’ Win
echoed Trocano’s sentiments: “It
was the most incredible offensive
display I have seen in my entire
coaching career,” James said of his
Huskies less-than-dazzling per-
formance, influenced greatly by
Pitt’s aggressive defense. Pitt beat
up on the Huskies in the first half,
let up a bit in the third quarter, but
came back to make the big play
when it appeared Washington was
in position to make 5 comeback.
The reason Washington came to
life in the second half was because
James inserted a new quarterback,
Tom Flick, who replaced senior
Tom Porras. The Seattle fans
booed Porras at the end of the first
half, because he had completed
only two of nine passes, with two
interceptions. Flick seemed to be a
flashy type, but/ he was a bit too
anxious several times in the second
half, and his eagerness resulted in
turnovers. »_ .
The big play of the game cam
with eight minutes remaining.
Dave Trout punted to the Pitt
45, and the Huskies, trailing 20-14,
had plenty of momentum on their
side. But on the first play. Jojo
Heath, ona blitz, stormed through,

. disrupted the exchange, and picked

the‘ ball out of the air for a fumble
recovery.

“We had them scouted pretty

good," said Heath. “They did
nothing that. surprised us. I think
they pretty much had to stick with
what they had sinceit won four
games for them.”

In the first half, Pitt used a two
tight end formation much of the
time, with Randy McMillan de-
ployed as the lone running back.
This enabled the Panthers to take
advantage of their great physical

strength up front,.and split the

Yesterday’s Miller Lite Beer

road race at Three Rivers Stadium '

was a classic example of how not to
organize an event'involving over
100- persons. Lack of drinking
water, restroom facilities of any
kind, and split timesat the mile
marks were only part of the
.problem. An additional headache
came to light when it was
discovered—upon completiton of
the race—that the course was not
to kilometers long (6.2) miles, but
anywhere from 600 to 800 meters
too long. .

On abrighter note, however, Pitt.
came away from the meet with
winners in several categories.
Gary Siriano was the overall
chafnpion, covering the distance in
33:10. Next was Pitt graduate
Mark Studnicki, a member of the
panther squad last year. His time
was 34:26.  I ‘

Next .for Pitt were Rich‘ Laitta,
fourth place overall and first place

in his age group (37:23), John
Huchison, ﬁfth overall and second
in his age group.

Panthers Mark Hazlett and Jim
Herrmann were sixth and twelfth,@.-
respectively. Two of the team’s .
runners, Bob Landstrom and

A Randy Bailey, had to" drop out of -

the race due to injuries.

Pitt sophomore Melanie Nicker-
son, a member of the women’s
track team, finished second overall
in ladies’ competition, while
winning her age group in 45:10.

“I thought this race would be
much easier,” said Nickerson. “It
was a ﬂat course and all, but I felt
I was running so much faster than
the time they gave me.”

will run its one home collegiate
meet this Saturday_ morning when
the Panthers take on the Kent State

The Panthers  it, they answered all their critics
by putting it all -‘together when needed most, in

‘beating a good Washington football team _26-14.

With a combination of great defense and a good
offense, Pitt inched closer to the top ten and may will
have cracked it come Tuesday.

It was a cruciallgame, the kind the coaches like to
label as “pivotal.” A win propelled the Panthers
back into the bowl picture but a loss would have
ended such thoughts. It was a contest that was
needed to quiet critics who said the Panthers and
Jackie Sherrill could not win the big game. The
Panthers accomplished both.

The win was ; not marked by individual
performances but by a total team effort. The offense
did not turn the ball over and defense caused six
turnovers. Quite {a turn-around from three weeks
ago when it was just the opposite.

quarter, a first occurrence for the season. The early
score had to be a big plus for the much-maligned
offense and ittook pressure off the defense.

One of the main reasons for the resurgence of th
offense is the improved play of the offensive line.

 

‘ Coach Jackie Sherrill realized this and promptly gav

credit where it was due.

“Doug Martin, who is a great player, had one
tackle and you can credit that to Mark May,‘ who
played a super game. The whole line just played their
hearts out,” he said. , . L‘

“May, Fidler, Gruber, Pryor, Boures, Grimm and
Dombrowski all did a tremendous job,” said Coach
Sherrill.» " ‘

The defense—or should I say the wall—once again ,6

played brilliantly. The unit, which is ranked as one
of the best in the nation, consistently came up with
superb plays when it looked as_,though the Huskies
would crack it.

Anchored by‘ All-American Hugh Green the unit is
superb and should continue to respond to adversity
(throughout the year. ' -

The Panthers are coming into their own just at the
right time of the season. With Washington behind
them and a victory safely tucked away in the win
column the Panthers cannot afford a let down
against the next opponent: Navy. The Naval
Academy comes into Pitt Stadium undefeated and a
win against such an illustrious opponent as Pitt
would boost their bowl aspirations. .

The Panthers, however, should overcome the

midshipmen due to their stalworth defense and their

suddenly opportunistic offense.

, taking three singles matches.

’Randi_Belkin easily won 6-1, 6-2
and Cathy Jacobson was spectac-
ular in her 6-1, 6-1 win. Jan
Brownstein was the singles winner,

- overpowering her opponent, 6-2,

6-1. Cincinnati came up with three
victories as Lia LaFuria lost a tough
match, 4-6, 6-7 and Aldene Lacaria

L gave her opponent a run before

losing; 6-7, 6-7. Beth Baughman
was Cincinnati’s third victim, as
she lost 2-6, 0-6. Thus, the match
stood at 3-3 going into the ﬁnals.

Belkin ~ and Jacobson teamed for
a convincing win, 6-4, 6-2. Pitt,
however, could not win the next
two matches.

The West Virginia match took
the same route, as the Pantherettes
won three of the singles matches
but failed to clinch it in the doubles
half of the match. Randi Belkin,
Cathy Jacobson, and Lisa Lafuria
provided the wins this time. Jan
Brownstein, Annette Aloe, —and
Beth'Baughman took the losses. .

A large crowd watched the
doubles team of Weinberg and

back to win and even the match at

Pantherettes earlier this year. They

Pantherettes’ overall record to 3-4.

minutes of play. Play was even-,
but the Pantherettes could not
capitalize on various assaults at the
goal. With six minutes remaining,
Slippery Rock came back to score
again, making the score 2-0 at
halftime.

In the second half, Pitt was still
lethargic. It seven

minutes for Sue Guhn to score her
second goal of the day for “the

Rock.” With the score 3-0, Dee

Dee Kantner ﬁnally slapped one in

for Pitt from twenty feet out, but it

was too late for Pitt to attack, and

the game ended at 3-1.

There were two bright spots for ’

play so well.

, “Before the match, Irated it as a
toss-up,” he said. “Ohio State is a
good team, but they don’t really
hold as much over us as it looked
like Saturday.”

In getting to the ﬁnals, Pitt had
to defeat a tough Ottawa team
which came into the match ready to
play as this was their ﬁrst com-
petition this season.

In game one, the Pantherettes
went ahead 10-2 before Ottawa
could realize what was happening.

The Canadian’s came back, how-_

ever, to a 12-9 score before Pitt
could put the game away 15-9. The
Pantherettes were led in this game
by the spiking of captain Cindy
Chambers, off of some great sets
by Maria Perez. __

The second game was a great
team effort by Pitt as the
Pantherettes all were spiking,

blocking, serving and saving all-

over the court. Pitt went out in
front 4-0, but after an Ottawa
comeback fell behind 6-5. With the
score tied at 8-all, Pitt took control
to defeat Ottawa 15-11.

Ottawa actually led game three
at several times including 12-9,
before Pitt could take control to win
the game 15-12 offof some good
blocking and spiking by Andra
Pletz, Robin Kuklais and Paula
Olsen. i

“Against Ottawa we played a
good, consistent match. Each
player did her part in the win,”
/said Hebert.

The ﬁnals started outdisaster-
ously for Pitt as Ohio State jumped
off to an 11-1 lead in game one. The
Pantherettes were shell-shocked,
but regained their composure to
stage a magniﬁcent comeback to tie '
thegame 11-all. However, that
was as close as the Pantherettes
could get, losing 15-11.

  L Spikers Falter in Pitt Classic Loss to Ohio State

Game two) started much the same
as the Buckeyes jumped out to a 7-3
lead. Pitt.'_fought back to tie the
score at 8-all, but then fell behind
again 12-9.‘ :7 After a Chambers
spike, Pittfgained the side-out it
needed and then used it to its
advantageﬁ.‘-"Kuklais killed the ball

off an outside set by Perez to turn ‘

the game around. Pitt tied the scoe
at 12, and eventually won 15-12.

With the games tied at 1-1, the
all important third game was next,
to see who would go ahead in the
match. The Pantherettes started
off well leading through most of the
match. .Ohio State didn’t really get
on track until after tying the match
at 8-all. After that it was all-Ohio
State, as the Bucks took the game
three 15-10.

The last game was a see-saw
battle throughout, and again, Pitt
led much of the way including at
12-8. But, off theexcellent serving
of DiAnn Gorham, the setting of
Mary Ormsby and the hard hitting
of Karen Alsbrooks, the Buckeyes
came backtto take the. game and
match 15-13.

“We played with absolutely no ‘’

emotion "or." desire against Ohio
State-,3’ said Hebert. “It came
down to the fact that they wanted to
win more than we did—or at least
they played‘ like they did.”
Another reason for the Panther-
ette loss, according to~Hebert, was
the number of errors that Pitt
either made_or was forced to make.
Pit't’was forced into passing errors
because of‘; the Buckeye’s great
serving, but also made other

, mistakes like hitting the net with

serves, serving and hitting out of
bounds. 1

Hebert added that the Panther-
ettes (now -20-14-3) usually play like
they’re having a good time, but
didn’t do-that against Ohio State.
