Senior Yearbook
Honors Bowman
With Dedication

Owl To Commemorate Fifteenth
Anniversary Of Chance1lor’s
Assumption Of Office

Foreman Plans Changes

In commemoration of Dr. John G.
Bowman's 15th year as Chancellor of

the University, the 1935 Owl senior,

yearbook, will be dedicated to him.

According to Charles Foreman, C35,
editor of the book, this will be the
ﬁrst Owl in those ﬁfteen years thus
to honor the University head.

The wording of the dedication has,
of course. not been revealed. Last
year, however, in a paragraph under
the -Chancellor's photograph in the
Owl. the following was written:

“During these years (of his period
as Chancellor) he has brought many
material gains: more students, the
Cathedral of Learning, the Stadium,
and six other permanent University
buildings . . . There have been, more-
over, gains which cannot be measured
in Gothic spires a.nd 60—ton monoliths.
The reception for parents each fall
has welded the school more closely
with the community. Sincerity . . .
with students has lifted their spirit
and increased their conﬁdence .
There have been the good things done
which we can clearly count and . . .
the unremembered day-by-day inspira-
tions _ . , by which we are all march-
ing into a brighter air.”

Along with the inscription will be a
series of small character study pho-
tographs of Dr. Bowman centering
around one large picture.

Another innovation of this year’s an-
nual, according to -Foreman, is the
elimination of messages to seniors
written by the deans of the various
schools of the University. Instead
will be intimate personal writeups
of each dean,

“We want to make our book reada-
ble this year," Foreman -disclosed,
“and we think this will help_ Owls
have always been ‘loolrable’ but the
readable side has often been neg-
lected.”

Chapel Spire To

Ornamentation

Flying Buttresses At Ease
Make Lead-Coated Copper
Tower Outstanding

Truth may be stranger than ﬁction,
but the words of an architect are
stranger yet to a layman. 

Assailed by ﬂying butresses, cusp-{
ings—not cussing, crockets——not
Davy, pinials, ﬁnials and gargoyles;
a Pitt News reporter was thrown for
a verbal loss after he had asked A. A.
Klimcheck, super-
vising architect,
for a description
of the spire for
the Heinz Chapel’
which was recent-,l
ly approved for
c 0 n s truction by
Howard Heinz.

The many fez.-
tures of the Chap-
el spire, which
will make it one
of the oiitstanding
pieces of work of
its type in this
country and
abroad, when re-
duced to a lay-
in a n ’ s English
will be relatively
easy to pick out
on the completed
structure.
Features to be found in this coun-

 

Chapel Spire

ﬂying buttresses above the base of
the spire. These structures run ap-
proxiniately parallel to the lower
part of the main tower and are at-
tached to it at the base and top.

On the lead-coated copper plates
which will. cover the spire above and
around the open windows will be
small designs known as cuspings.

At the base of the tower will be sev-
eral medallions or carved shields.
Among the other details of the ﬂeche
(pronounced flesh). or spire are tlie
pinials, perpendicular structures 
sembling to some extent the lower
flying buttresses. They are much
smaller, however, and are attache_§,l_
to the main tower except at the top or
ﬁnial; small projections on the side
of the tower called crockets and many
gargoyles or animal ﬁgures.

The windows in the tower will not
have the usual louvres designed to
keep out the rain and snow, but will
be open. An arrangement of the roof
in the interior of the spire will pro-
vide drainage. '

Another unusual feature of the top
will be its accessibility. The interior
will have a system of trapdoors and
ladders by which most of the tower
will be accessible. For the topmost.
part, a means of erecting an outside
scaffolding is available,

All outside parts of the ﬂeche will
be constructed of a lead-coated copper
similar to that now covering the roof
but of a much heavier gauge, Each
part will be removable for cleaning or
repair. -

The work of fabricating the lead-
coated copper for the Gothic spire is
now going on. Construction will
probably begin next month.

Since all the steel will be covered
with moisture proof paint, and since
the top 25 feet of the tower will be
lead—treated
copper will protect the spire from or-
dinary deterioration,

INA Convention
Delegates Return

News Editors Hear Pearson At
New York Meeting

Drew Pearson, famous newspaper
man, co—author of “Washington Merry-
Go-Round” and “More Merry-Go-
Round," and founder of the Intercol-
legiate Newspaper Association of the
Middle Atlantic States addressed the
closing banquet of the fall convention
of that group Saturday evening.

Four delegates from The Pitt News,
including: John K. M- Tibby, Jr.,
C-3,5, editor; Ellis H. Tumpson, BA36,
business manager; Marjorie Reich,
C35, associate editor; and Charles B.
Holstein, C36, associate editor, at-
tended.

Pearson outlined his more interest-
ing experiences in journalistic work
and discussed the varying press poli-
cies of the last ﬁve presidents. He
also told of the founding of the INA
in 1919, when he and 12 other college
editors banded to raise the standard
of student journalism. Decrying the
narrow scope of student papers which
concentrate only on the trivialities of
campus events, Pearson asked for
more. intense student investigation
into political and social trends of the
day in the columns of college papers.
Such trends do and_ will affect the
lives of students more than ever, he
stated.

Among other speakers, Louis Vviley,
business manager of The New York
Times, and James VVechsler, editor of
The .Co1un1bia Spectator were out-
standing, Vvechsler gave a biting de-
nunciation of papers which become
mere propaganda organs of university
administrations, and crusaded for
more crusading editors, He traced
the development of ill-feeling between
his paper and the administration of
Columbia university since the days of
Reed Harris, expelled editor, and held
up his paper as one which is trying
to further social thought among un-
dergraduates.

Herbert Stare, editor of the Gettys-
burgian of Gettysburg college, is
president of INA. William S. Mauls-
by, professor and head of the depart-
ment of journalism here, is executive
secretary.

Microscopic animals and minute
fragments of living heart tissue grow-
ing outside of the body will be pro-
jected onto a screen and magniﬁed
many hundreds of times. Some of
men's utilizations of other animals
will be illustrated by motion pictures
of the work of the dogs trained to

appearance and demonstration of one
of these dogs under the guidance of
‘his master.

The growth of an animal will be

will illustrate the story of the interre-
latlon of body parts and functions and
of the hereditary transmission of

up for the visiting biologists.

Panther Talks Turkey

The Panther talks turkey today.

The Tha.nksgiving issue of the Pitt
Panther appears on campus today
with an unusual array of features,
among which is an article from Retsel
Nroh, new student from Abyssinia, en-
titled “The Worst Thanksgiving.”

the point of view of the cheerleader
by Fredric Kelly, C38, and from the
spectators slant in “Cheers and
Jeers.” In sharp contrast with the
Damon Runyon style of “Saga of the
Track” by William H_ Ostrow, BA3 ,
is a takeoff on Chaucer by Sanford C.
Anderson, C35.

Fifty prominent campus leaders tell
what-they are thankful for in the sur-
prise article of the magazine. After
many conferences, the winner of the
contest for the funniest joke is an-
nounced.

“Retailing is the ﬁnal step in the
process of production and distribu-
tion,” said Edward A. Filene, presi-
dent of William Filene Sons, Boston,
at a banquet for retailers last night
at Hotel Schenley. ' ' ‘

“It is the outlet,” Mr. Filene con-
tinued. “Each retail store is a
faucet at the end of a kind of pipe-
line through which goods are flowing
from the original source to the con-
sumer. If there is any leak anywhere
along the line, the faucet won't work;
and it won’t make much difference
until that leak is repaired, whether
the faucet is any good or not." He
added:

“The one possible answer to chain
store competition is to get foods from
their original source to the ultimate
consumer with less waste both in pro-
duction and transit. The tendency is
towards nationwide cooperation, with-,
out elimination of competition.

Football cheering is discussed froml

TIIERE IS a camp in Bavaria

where 10,000 children between
the ages of 10 and 16 are trained.
The camp is beautiful and 1nuch
that tl1e children do is admirable.
They are brought up i11 a splendid
physical atmosphere. They learn
what every huma11 being must
.learn in order to be free: disci-
pline.

B11t this whole camp is domin-
ated by a vast banner stretched
across a hillside, and visible at
every moment of daylight from
any corner of tl1e ca1np. It is a
great wl1ite banner and on it are

painted a black swastika and‘

seven black words:

“IVE ‘WERE BORN TO DIE
FOR GERIVIANY.”

In the European countries
where
humiliation l1ave turned the peo-
ple to fascism not a corner of life
reinains that has not been invaded
by the idealism of the-nation-
above-all. Universities may no
longer give training, in these
cou11tries, to as many as are ﬁtted
to receive training, but rather to
the number which can be absorbed
in the key jobs of the state, and
these only when they have satis-
ﬁed the strongest tests for con-
formityto fascist ideals. _

The progress of women towards
equal career opportunity with
men has been checked and de-
clared an un-nationa.l and unnat-
ural progress. Women are dedi-
cated to the creation of children,
preferably boys, who may begin
to take military training almost
at once. The Church is allowed
to remain, but in a restricted
character: to bless the soldier and
bury the dead.

In Italy last week one of the

COMPLAINTS BY syndicated
New York sports writers that
college football is still being
played in large stadiums before a
great many persons are just a. lit-
tlc overripe. ’
Fifteen years ago, or before
large football and athletic sta-
diums commenced to spring up on
American campuses, there were
not nearly so many football fans,
not nearly so many sports writ-
ers; a11d if there was a. single syn-
dicated sports editor, earning
twice as much as a professor of
psychology, the name escapes us.
A few ambitious sports editors,
then, took college football in hand
and promoted it into the kind of
subject that can be overﬂowed
into the sports pages from Sep-
tember until Christmas and that
can-.be used moderately all the
rest of the year.

The sports pages made football
summoned
overﬂow crowds to the contests
and made everybody from the
Ozarks to the Black Hills familiar
with Red Grange. Universities
got themselves expert coaching
staffs and raised stadiums over
their heads.

The Mail

Editor, The Pitt News:

Just about this time last year con-
siderable agitation on the part of the
Pitt News was carried on for the re-
duction-‘of car fare for students“com-
muting between their homes and the
University. Student Council was sup-
posed to have aided the worthy cause
last year, but failed to bring any re-
sults_ Perhaps this organization did
not use the right procedure in their
attempt to bring about a reduction in
trolley‘-*-fares. ~ ~ .-

Thus far this semester there ha
been no "agitation for reduced fares.
Perhaps the students have lost inter-
est in the matter; more probably they
have lost hope,

We have a new organization on the
campus called the University Assem-
bly. We also have a student publica-
tion called The Pitt News. Why does
not one of these organizations, or
both, carry on where last year's or-
ganizations left off? Only with a. lit-
tle more perslstency,

We could not charter a. car for Pitt, I

Tech and Duquesne students because
of the situations of these colleges.
But we could get a weekly pass, upon
presentation of our registration cards
say for 75 cents or $1, which would
save those who use 20 checks at week
considerable money. How would we
get this pass? That is the problem
which could be solved by a commit-
tee that would be really interested in
the project.

HROUGHOUT THE FRATERNITY house midnight quiet had

“Oh come" on, just ‘bne more game,”
Bob replied, “The score is tied now

The ﬁrst ﬂoor was deserted but for
a single dim light in the hall_ On the
second ﬂoor a typewriter clicked
steadily; and in her room the house-

In the corner room on the third ﬂoor
a. young man, clad only in pajamas, a

papers from the desk. A heavy
binder emarked Arcl1ives——English 21
lay on the ﬂoor, while a few typewrit-
ten pages lay strewnabout the room.
The boy read one, then another, and
tossed them both aside. “These pa-
pers might have been good once,” he
thought, “but now they are rather
old-l'ashioned.”

He smiled when he glanced at the
dates: January ’31, September '30,

’27_ He opened them and read the
sentences underlined as “Topic Sen-

He could visualize D1‘.'lVlye1's’ writ-

times those lraternity archives were
useful, as they were in history, but it
was seldom that the English papers
could get him started.

One of the downtown papers recent-

Carlson Watches
Pitt Varsity Five
In Practice Game
Possible Starting Lineup Includes

Roderick, Emerick, Noon,
Cribbs, And Hughes

 

The varsity basketball team, busy
practicing for the coming season,
slipped in a practice scrimmage game
last week-end with the McKeesport
Willigs at the stadium. No score was
kept, the game being held strictly for
practice, but the scrimmage did give
an idea as to the probable starting
lineup for the Panther varsity.

Coach H. C. Carlson used his entire
squad of 17 players during the game.
The starting lineup, which looms as
the possible ﬁrst team at least for the
opening game, lined up with..C'ribbs
and Hughes at forwards, Noon at cen-
ter, and Roderick and Emerick at the
guards. The next team had Ferguson
and Jesko at the forwards__ Garcia at
center, and Taylor and Rowe at the
guards. The third combination that
Dr. Carlson played consisted of Wainio
and Nickel at forwards, Rugh at cen-
ter, and Loucks and Lasky at guards.
Kuno and VVi1son, the remaining mem-
bers of the squad, were used as sub-
stitutes for the ﬁrst and second com-
binations. Dr, Carlson made it clear,
however, that the lineups used were
entirely tentative and may be changed
before the start of the season.

For the Vvilligs, several former Pitt
varsity stars were in the lineup. Don
Smith, Timmy Lawry, former Panther
basketball captains, and Arthur played
against their Alma Mater in the game.
The remainder of the \Villigs squad
that played were Rice, formerly of
Vvestminster; Janosik, of VVaynes-
burg; Crum, from Schenley high; and
Evanoski, of Connelly Trade School.

The Panther varsity will open its
season at the stadium, against Buck-
nell, December 8. After this game, the
varsity will rest until December 12,
when they leave for the miclwest for
four games with western teams. From
December 14 to January 14 the squad
will travel west to the Mississippi,
back to Pittsburgh, and east to the
Atlantic coast_ During that period
the team will have played games in
seven different states, and during
their 23—game schedule will play in 11
states.

Letters are already being received
by Dr. Carlson requesting information
about his annual basketball clinic
which will be held at the stadium, De-
cember 8. Thus far, letters have been
received from Long Island, New York,
Ohio, and W/Vest Virginia. Dr_ Carlson
will wait until after Thanksgiving be-
fore sending out the invitations.

40 Fresh Cagers
Report For Drills

Coach Kowallis Sends Candidates
' Through Light Work-Out

 

 

 

With 40 freshman basketball
candidates reporting, the fresh basket-
ball practices began Monday afternoon
at the stadium.

This is a marked increase over the
number that reported last year for
the squad, when only 25 freshmen ap-
peared at the initial practice.

The ﬁrst practice was entirely spent
limbering-up, passing a few balls
around, and some cutting and shoot-
ing at the basket. Coach "Dockey"
Kowallis was, for the most part,
pleased with the turn-out and the
number of candidates that at least have
played a game or two of basketball
before.

At the same time the varsity prac-
ticed, limiting the freshmen to only
the use of one-half of the ﬂoor, which
cramped the workouts of both the
fresh and the varsity. Later, how-
ever, when the"'fr'eshman squad has
been cut, there will be plenty of space
on the floor for the drills.

Of the candidates that reported,
many are ex-high school stars, Among
these are: E.d Spotovich. Rags Rad-
vansky, Jimmy and Ed Leech, Van
Jones, Bob Emerick, Ollie Langyel,
Herb Beckett, and Miles Zeleznick.
These frosh candidates appear on the
whole to be heavier and bigger than
the present varsity.

The squad will get down to strenu-
ous practice as soon as possible, since
their ﬁrst game will be played as a
preliminary to the varsity game with
Bucknell here, December 8, This al-
lows only a little better than tvo
weeks for the yearling squad to get
into shape for their opening game.
The opponent for the game is as yet
undetermined.

Practice will be held for the frosh
squad every school day. The prac-
tices begin between 3:30 and 4:00
o'clock and end at 7:30 o'clock.

 

Boxing Practice

 

Coach Jack Schricker has an-
nounced. that all boxing candidates
should report at the stadium locker
room at 2:30 o'clock on Monday, De-
cember 3. Althdugh the team enjoy-
cd only mediocre success last season,
the number of veterans who are back
and the addition of new talent point
to a successful year.

Satu rcfay Of Surprises

_ Saturday, November 17, 1934, will be a day remembered as long
as men in Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsy1..Va,nia,s.t.ick their feet
up against stoves and talk about football.

Along the betting fronts, the day may come to be referred to as
’ Although it. may be a mistake to call it “Sur-
inasmuch as some of the surprises weren’t so great

as were others, nevertheless that ancient kettle known as the dope
with an:

‘ ‘ Silver Saturday. ’
prise Saturday, ’ ’

bucket was kicked around
abandon that leaves the sound of
hanging tin still in the air.

Maryland was perhaps the least

surprised. The halo of greatness
which surrounds an unbeaten and un-
tied team was shining over the Navy,
to be sure, but the Marylanders
weren't taking the Pitt Panthers any
too lightly. What did surprise them,
however, was the ease and dispatch
with which these Panthers roared
and clawed through those Navy
tackles and around the Middie ends.
They didn’t expect, to see a mass of
Pitt interference sweeping down the‘
ﬁeld ahead of the ball carrier much
in the manner of an efficient house-
wife giving her kitchen ﬂoor the works
with her favorite broom.

But down there in Princeton, say,
that’s where they had to start pinch-
ing one another to believe their eyes.
All last week the Princeton collegians
had been spilling bottles of ink and
ﬁlling no end of fountain pens in de-
termined efforts to get petitions signed
which demanded a. post-season game
with a “worthy opponent."

One can imalgine how docile tﬂ
Yale boys must have felt when they
heard of that, what with them supply-
ing the fodder for the Princeton
siege guns on the following Saturday.
Just exactly 11 of them reacted in
such a way that they went out there
and took everything the Princetonians
had, ﬂung it right back in their faces,
and got sore enough to smack over a
touchdown while the Nassaus were
yet fumbling for their newspaper clip-
pings.

That continued ripping noise, as of
paper being torn, is only the Prince-
ton sophomores demolishing their en-
thusiastic petitions. It seems that
when a team beats you 7-0 you have
at last found a “worthy opponent.”
At any rate, the Princeton authori-
ties are relieved of any worries about
a post-season game. It’s very likely
that they don’t feel any too happy
about that.

Back down here in Pittsburgh it
was the Carnegie Techs who ran right
out there under the noses of the Du-
quesne Dukes and hollered “Surprise.”
The ;'Dukes, who had a very happy
habit of wearing out opponents’ goal
lines during the

K J. Reynolds Tzrrbacco Oompzmy .

course of a game,«ness.

didn't get a chance to ﬂeck off a bit
of the lime on the line the Techs were
guarding.

Now those fans who were clamor-
ing for the Dukes to get a crack at
Pitt before the city title was award-
ed may crawl back into their shells,
thankful at least that they did not,
waste any ink ‘on petitions. Tech’s;
victory, besides doing the Panthers a
nice favor, placed the handwriting
very plainly on the wall that the
Thanksgiving Day battle here will be
well worth holding up the turkey din-
ner‘ for. After‘ taking a two-day vaca-
tion from the football wars, the Pan-
ther gridders will be hard at it again
this afternoon to prepare a program
which will prevent Joe Mihm and his
mates from delivering any more sur-
prise packages.

McMunn’s Run Gives Sigs
Victory In Frat Football

 

 

Rain, mud, and slop! All this cov-
ered the Greek passers————from Jack
W'yeth"s red and white Ohio State
tousel to “Weasel” Connelly’s dainty
“double A’s”——as the Kappa Sigs de-
feated the Phi Gams in an interfr_a-
ternity game at the varsity practice
ﬁeld Monday. McMunn gave Kappa
Sigma a victory by scampering 65
yards for a. touchdown with only a
minute and one-half to go. i
A- The ﬁrst half ended with the score
tied 0-0, the Kappa Sigs leading in
first downs, 2-0.

Numerous interceptions by the Kap-
pa. Sig secondary continued to slow
down the Phi Gram attack during the
second half. The only sustained drive
made by the Phi Gams during the
game came late in the. ﬁnal period
when a ﬁve-man interference swept
around right end twice in succession
to register a ﬁrst down. VVith only a
yard to go for their second ﬁrst and

Kirkpatrick Leads Panther Men
By Capturing Sixth Place;
Tom Ottey Gets First

Led by Charles Kirkpatrick who
took sixth place, the Panther cross-
country team ﬁnished in sixth posi-
tion in the national inter-collegiate
championship run over the Van Cort-
land park course Monday afternoon.
The Pitt boys piled up a total of 191
points, just ﬁve more than the Cornell
team, which ﬁnished in ﬁfth place.

After Kirkpatrick came Kenny W‘a.-
genhouser in 37th position who in turn
was followed closely by Bill Albright
in 43rd place. Charles ‘Howe and
Harold Tost, in 50th and 55th places,
respectively, completed the scoring for
Pitt. .,Sam Musico had to be content
with the 57th notch ‘and Charles
Groat, the only other Panther entry,
trailed along in 102nd place.

For the second straight year Tom
Ottey. Michigan State veteran ran
brilliantly to win this classic event,
setting a new record of 31 minutes
54.6 seconds. His teammates were
grouped closely enough together to
give the boys from Lansing the team
championship for the second consecu-
tive year, scoring 7 points. Maine’s
unusua.lly strong team took second
place with 93 markers.

Kirkpatrick’s time for the six-mile
run was 3:-‘; minutes and three seconds.
This marks the second time this sea-
son that “Kirk” has ﬁnished well up
among the leaders in national open
meets. He garnered a third place

season's showing in the same meet
when they took seventh.

The first ten teams and their scores
at the ﬁnish were as follows: Michi-
gan State, 77; Maine, second, 93; Man-
hattan, third, 128; Yale, fourth, 166;
Cornell, ﬁfth, 186; ihitt, sixth, 191;:
Harvard, seventh. 205; Penn State,
eighth, 22-0; Syracuse, ninth, 221;
and Rhode Island State, tenth, 275.

While Pitt didn’t ﬁnish ﬁrst, it did
get even for the Penn State defeat by
ﬁnishing well ahead of the State run-
ners.

ll-laying completed their rambling
around the country for this season,

the barriers will make their ﬁnal ap-
pearance of the year in the senior,
AMA jaunt to be held on Saturday at}

EDWARD KENT, '36- GEOLOGY STUDENT.
Edward Kent knows the value of a full re-
serve of natural, vibrant energy. And that's
one of the reasons why he sticks to Camels.
In his own words: “It takes a lot of hard
work to acquire any thorough knowledge of
geology—and a lot of energy. It’s tiring at
times, but like most of the fellows aroundc
here, I have found that smoking a Camel
cheers me up . . . chases away all fatigue . . .
gives me that ‘lift’ in mental alertness and
physical well-being which I need to be able
to go on working with renewed energy.”

The Navy Passes In Review

 

Many of the people who spent two hours somethingto write home about by their march.

and a half making the 21-mile trip fromi
Washiiigton, D. C.. to Annapolis were dis-
appointed because the Navy midshipmen didl
not march between halves. A couple of our]
fondest illusions were also shattered when we I
watched the Navy boys doing their cheering.

Even that “song of the N‘avy," the re-
nowned "Anchors Aweigh," got only about a
50 per cent: response from the middies. Some
of the Navy men had leather-lungs, it is true,
but. there were plenty of the boys who just
didn't bother to cheer. It -was kind of hard
to believe, even though they didn't have much
to cheer about after those ﬁrst ﬁve minutes.

“Joc " Sutherland pulled a fast one on the
boys down at Washington. There was a
crowd of over 2,000 gathered at Georgetowifs
ﬁeld to Watch the Panthers work out on Fri-
day afternoon. “Jock" put his men through
a brief drill and allowed the newspaper men
and cameraman to get their fill of stories and
pictures. Then he called it a day there and
took the 33 men away from the ﬁeld to hold
a secret practice on a ﬁeld out of the city
while state police guarded the entrances.

The many Navy men who had been in the
crowd at the Georgetown ﬁeld felt very
foolish when they heard of the fast one Suth-
erland had pulled. f

she visited peasant villages during
harvest festivals and colorful holiday
celebrations.

“Everywhere,” says Miss Rearick,
“I was received hospitably, almost
eagerly. The Hungarians have such
a deep love for their country, they
seem to want every stranger to love
it, too.”

‘Trials Of ‘Trouble

Shooter’ At State
Hall Exchange

“This place is about as bad as a
small town,” was the opinion of one
of the telephone company “trouble-
shooters" who was found “trouble
shooting” in the University's private
exchange switchboard in State hall.

There are about 285 telephones in
campus buildings whose calls are
handled through the telephone office,
sandwiched between Rooms 201 and
202 in State hall. To keep things run-
ning, it takes four service men on the
job most of the time, and two opera-
tors working in overlapping shifts.

The peaks in the number of calls,
according to the operators, come at
about 11 o’clock in the morning and
2: 30 o’clock. “That is when most people
are making or breaking luncheon or
dinner engagements," they put in by
way of explanation.

Their worst session, they said, came
before the Southern California and

 

Minnesota football games. People in-
sisted on calling the University's
number, Mayﬂower 3500. instead of

the stadium at Mayﬂower 4900.
