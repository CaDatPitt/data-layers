Student Government Board
(SGB) member Steve Tarnock
officially refused to comply with a

‘f Board motion calling for his

 resignation at Monday night's SGB
 meeting.

The motion, passed at the

previous SGB meeting, requested

Tarnock to give up his seat on the

/ Board because of his lack of

performance since the end of the
spring term. The motion also gave
Tarnock the option of remaining on
' the Board if he promised to

SGB next year.

While formally stating his choice
to stay, Tarnock promised that the
situation would “turn around” in
the fall.

“I would not like to resign now,”
said Tarnock; “I'll be able to put a
lot more time into Student
Government in the fall since I won’t
have any other outside activities.”

After. stiff criticism, SGB-member Steve ”Tar'nock refused ‘to step
down at Monday’s Board meeting, but he promised to “Turn around”

.“Thefts probably make up close
to 80% of all criminal incidents,”
Conte estimated. [Although rob-
bery is by far the most common
crime at Pitt, there are. relatively
few car thefts. Conte stressed that '
in well over 50% of the cases,
simple precautions-such as locking
doors could eliminate the thief’s
chance to act.

is the most crime-ridden area on
campus, according to Pitt Police

' Chief Curt Graham. The Towers/ "

accounts for a high concentration of A

Conte attributed only small
decreases in summertime crime to
student body reduction, but added ’
that the warm weather accountsfor
slight increases in‘ asault.

Graham said.

 

Graham emphasized that several

defense courses “not to make you

give you a few seconds to get

Tarnock maintained that per-
sonal problems prevented him fro
working actively on SGB this
summer. V

Because Tarnock already had
received remuneration for expected
summer work, the SGB passed a
motion mandating that Tarnock
repay the amount--$4.';0--from the
reniuneration he would receive in
the fall. .

The repayment schedule, the
Board decided, must be worked out
between Tarnock and Assistant
Vice-Chancellor‘ for Student Affairs
William Markus befo_re the fall
term.

In related action, Tarnock
elected\to retain his right to attend
monthly Senate Council meetings
in an official capacity after SGB

President Larry Platt questioned ,

the propriety of Tarnock’s' sudden
appearance at meetings he prev-
iously never attended.‘ .

As one of the top vote-getters in _

.Ianuary’s SGB election, Tarnock 

was assigned an official seat on the
Senate Council. Since his election,
though, Tarnock has failed ‘ to
attend any Senate»Council meeting.-
“We (SGB) "could “ lose our ‘
credibilityif we have you "go to
these meetings when you never

would have spent on interest
‘ waiting for a higher allotment.”

Pitt’s appropriation was passed
in the House only after Pitt agreed
to. cut $467,000 from the total
budget passed by the'state— Senate.
4 “That was a slice the House
called for on the last day of
negotiations,” noted Posvar. “The

3‘ University State Funding
 ‘on Time But I\ot Enough’

BY GENE GRABOWSKI million, passed by -both the ‘state
House and the Senate last week,
was substantially lower than the
amount originally requested from
the Commonwealth for next year,
but it was an appreciable increase
over the $53.7 million originally
proposed in the Governor Shapp_‘s
budget. It’s also $6.5 million
higher than the University’s
appropriation for last year.

“We got as much as we could
hope for,” Posvar said. “In some
years we’ve had to borrow money
at great interest rates to keep going

' until our appropriation came
through in the fall. With such an ‘
early appropriation as this year’s, .
we’ll be saving’; the ..;m'onev 1 we 

less than the Senate proposed, and
we accepted it to get an early
settlement.” '

Posvar warned of “a severe
problem in medicine” as a result of
the hight costs of malpractice
insurancepfor Pitt’s doctors and no
increase in the capitation rate for
medical students.

The cost of malpractice in-
surance hasn’t leveled off yet, but
Pitt administrators have predicted
it will be astaggering..bill_ that will
escalate the medical school budget
by millions.

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar ~
said yesterday ‘he was “happy
about the timing” of Pitt’s
‘appropriation for fiscal year 1975-
76, but “less than satisfied” about
the amount of money given Pitt in
next year’s state budget.

“It was only the second time in
recent years we’ve got our budget
'4 _ _on time,” Posvar said. “Before
" st year and this year, we’ve had
. to wait until September for ofﬁcial
appropriation. ‘At least this year
we don’t have to operate without a
budget even though, of course, we
could have used more money.”

cover the cost of running the
medical school. "Currently listed at
$7,400 per student at Pitt, it’s
based on the number of students
the medical school serves.

Because of inﬂated costs, the
University had asked for an
increase to $9,200 in the capitation
rate, but the request was turned
down. '

Pitt’s single largest budget item
is salaries for its employees,
according the Vice-Chancellor of
Planning and Budget Jacki Free-
man. Freeman estimated that 70%
of the budget was for staff salaries.

. The elimination of tuition is now
included in.a separate bill headed
for a House-Senate conference
committee in the ‘fall.

If the Governor signs Pitt’s
appropriation bill without cutting
it, as it seems likely, the University
should be able to provide merit
compensation increases promised
its employees next January, Posvar
said. '

Bond, the often controversial
ﬁgure head of the “New Politics.”

Bond’s outspoken anti-war pos-
ture gained the nation’s eye in 1965

to deny him an earned seat in the-

Georgia legislature.

The graduation excercise will

inadequacies in the system and
problems with evaluating the
performance of individuals.

SGB members are now receiving

payment for their activities over the

summer. Board members are
getting $450 and.SG President
Larry Platt is getting $900.

This method of compensation
was instituted for this summer
only, according to Platt, because of
the immediate ﬁnancial problems
of SG members.

“I was in a real ﬁnancial bind,”
Platt said. “I had no money "or
anything.” ,

Under the present system for
SGB, hours are noted each day by
various Board members and
reported to the Student Affairs
Office. -

“Furick left it for us to handle; it
was one of the‘ ﬁrst orders of
business when. we tookvofﬁce,”
Platt said. “And we didn’t want to
vote ourselves money over the
summer while most of the students
were away.” - -" . -

In an effort to deal with the
ﬁnancial problems of remaining in
Pittsburgh, Platt, along with
University officials, arranged to
have student aid money given to
SGB members.

“I pushed for a. base of two
dollars an hour,” Platt said,
“based on a time committment
from Board members of 15 hours a
week and 30 hours a week for
myself.

State‘ Funds Pitt

(Continued from Page 1)

Utility costs,‘ according to Free-
man, mark another substantial
item in Pitt’s operating budget at
about $8 million. Pitt's utility costs
for next year have gone up by $2
million.

Posvar added he was relieved
that the appropriations bill had
passed in the General Assembly
without amendments that would
have required faculty and staff
retrenchment and the elimination
of the tuition remission program for
employees as originally proposed.

“We had problems because we
never set up a way to evaluate the
process; It was just a one-shot deal
to get us through the summer until
we could come up with a
remunerations policy.”

Other problems developed over
the evaluation of individual per-
formance, which recently resulted
in a motion by the Board to urge
Board member Stephen Tarnock to
return his money because of poor
attendance.

The problem of creating an
adequate remunerations system for
undergraduate student leaders was
the subject of a comprehensive
survey by Furick and former Board
member Janet Toth in 1973, in
which over 100 universities and
colleges were surveyed on their
remuneration policies. The report
remained uncompiled until SGB
member Mary Schwartz recently
decided to research the question.

“Most colleges ﬁnance remu-
nerations from Student‘ Activities
fees and other plans,” Schwartz
said. “A grant of University hard
money doesn’t look realistic.”

Schwartz estimated that the
number of persons who could

receive remunerations would be ’

around 17, because of monetary
constraint. _
“Everyone will have to submit

job descriptions to the Board (of.

Remunerations), _and then the
Board will have to keep evaluating
their performance. We'll probablv
have to fund positions, not people,

because it could get really sticky.” ,
The question of remuneration for  ‘

tudent leaders arose after a strike
y the Pitt News staff in 1972,
according to report by Willima
Markus, assistant to Vice-Chan-
cellor of Student Affairs Alfred
Moye. . '

According to the report by
Markus remuneration for the Pitt
News staff through a “merit
assistance program” raised the
expectations of other student
leaders.

At present SG expects ‘some
resolution of the remuneration
question by September, and the
creation of a Remunerations Board
later.

Although a Remunerations

Board exists now, it is relatively{ ‘,_

inactive because of Furick’s
decision.

 Last week’s 4-1 vote by the Student Government Board requesting
-Board member Stephen Tamock’s’ resignation came  a sign of
é_aution.to Pitt students who are concerned with maintaimng the Board

_—_Th,ough the Board has decided, upon hearing Tarnock’s explanation,
to allow him to retain his position, students should be well advised’ to
follow the work of their representatives and assess their perfomiance.

The seven members of the Board have an awesome responsibility to
represent over 10,000 students, and if at times such a ratio becomes too
— burdensome, then perhaps constitutional changes are in order so that
’_Ir,epre‘sentaﬁves can fulﬁll their jobs effectively.
" however, the work of the student government must be carried out
_  primary leadership of six board members and a chairman. If
as representative feels for any reason that he is imable to provide the
ﬂservice he was elected to perform, then a resignation is in order.

7 Though resigning is often taken as a personal defeat, there remains
 no victory or success in depriving a constituency of honest and .

acted overzealously, and moreover,
its striving probably impeded
building more than it added to
Chartres’ impressiveness.

Twentieth century technical pro-
jects have exhibited a similar air of
blemished consonance in atomic
and space research. First and
Second World nations have made
technical advancements through
mutual fear and power gain. The
combined effect of such massive
projects has induced massive-
cultural changes, transforming
society as severely'as the Renais-
sance did. This sudden change
spawned worldwide decline in the-
fine arts during the 1950’s and
1960's. _ -

Now, however, the fine arts are

rising in importance once more.
Young talents in 1975 easily
emulate their seniors from the
..early Atomic Age. Since the
McCarthy Era, the Dark Ages of
Atomic Age attitudes, hundreds of
harassed artists such as Arthur
Miller are making social evalua-
tions of a nation less w_i_lling to
censor. We often scoff at
“Tail-Gunner Joe’s” Red Menace,
yet neither in the ﬁne arts nor in
science do the United States and
the Soviet Union graciously honor
each other’s achievements.

In the earliest major instance of
Soviet-American cultural acknow-
ledgement, young Van Cliburn won
the 1958 Tchaikovsky Competition
at Moscow. Since that time, and
especially since the cultural ex-
change incorporated with detente,
the United States and the USSR
have engaged in much reciprocal
fine arts performance and training.
The Apollo-Soyuz mission, advan-
ces collaboration into scientiﬁc
ﬁelds. The American and Soviet.
nations, however, are cooperating
and advancing without forming a
true alliance. “Cultural exchange”
has a hollow sound because it
affronts traditional political rivalry.

  Open Letter to Legislators

BY CAL RITCHEY

Dear Legislators--you as a group
are out oftouch with,reality. When
a supposedly intelligent body of
men expresses interest in depriv-
ing secretaries and mail clerks of
an education, the best think I can

.say is that it is out of touch.

According to reports, you want to
do away with tuition remission at
the Pitt and several other state-
related colleges. You say your
blue-collar/constituents are upset
at the highly paid professors who
get free tuition for their children,
while less well-paid union workers
must pay to send their kids to
school.

Nonsense. The fact is, legisla-

A tors, that you will be depriving -

those very blue-collar constituents
about whom you are so concerned.
It’s those $6,000-a-year" secretaries

. who most needtuition remission--

most‘ often for themselves, and

especially when they’re young.»

How many secretaries go to night

school? How many mail clerks or

grounds keepers are enrolled in

engineering? Have you investi-'
-gated, legislators? There are a

good many of them out‘there--.

voters.

And let’s suppose the major
beneﬁciary of tuition remission is
these highly paid professors--but
are they highly paid? It’s a fact
that in 1972, the average national
wage in the building industry (for
example) was more than $15,300.
That’s the average national wage--'
not the Pennsylvania average.‘ In
most averages, Pennsylvania ranks

,well above the national average.

I

But as for those highly paid
professors: one year later, with the
cost of living higher and certainly
the .union average higher, Pitt was

' paying its teaching faculty an

average of only $16,838, according
to the Annual American Associa-‘

”j’Cooperation tl1roughDetente

Like the Cult of Carts, participants
in today’s artistic and technological
logrolling forward. impure desires
for - achievement. - Talents with
dubious internationalistic motives
characterize their fields rather than
enhance them. Critics still laud the
successes of cultural exchange, but
one nevertheless remarks forced

enthusiasm and veiled rivalry as,

distracting qualities of ’ modern
masterworks.

After a major ﬁre,
Chartres’ twin Romanesque towers
required reconstruction. Due to a
miscalculation, the newer Gothic
tower is distractingly taller than the
other. -While not seriously
detracting from Chartres’ artistic
value, the inequality of heights
draws the eye and causes the
observer to wonder about the
artist’s intended effect.

Just as the spires’ unevenness

characterizes Notre Dame de.

Chartres, the slight blemish of
jingoism marks products of modern
cultural exchange. Posterity will

not subordinate our . advancements '

because of their creator’s provin-
cial outlooks, but no matter what
we accomplish, our disparate
viewpoints Wlll remain asobvious
as Chartres’ distinctive architec-
tural styles, only far less attractive.

tion of University Professors’
Salary Survey for 1974-75. The
union figures came from the 1974
Associated Press Almanac.’

So, lawmakers, it turns out that

"your blue-collar constituent may

very well be making more money
than those highly paid professors--
who have spent four, six, eight,

even ten years in pursuit of their

ed_ucations while the union carpen-
ters and plumbers and garbagemen
were building up seniority and job
security. Security is something a
professor has to work to achieve.
In a union, it comes automatically,
after 90 days. ,

No, I’m not saying that carpen-
ters or truck drivers are paid too
much. I’m saying that professors
are paid too little for the time they
have spent in preparation for their
careers. Truck drivers don’t spend
a minimum of four years learning
to drive. Steelworkers don’t spend
six years working nights as
dishwashers to put themselves
through graduate school. Carpen-
ters don’t deprive their families of
vacations in order to get Ph.Ds.‘- A
college professor ‘ does all these
things--and if, after 10 or 15 years,
he's’ granted a position

or Erie, be interested in knowing"
that in 1974 Pitt had only 78
professors who made more than
$25,000 per year? Seventy-eight
out of 1,064?

If all this isn’t convincing, how .-
about this statement from a
personnel man at Pitt: If the
legislators eliminate the tuition
remission program, Pitt will 5.,
immediately lose 30% of its 9
employees, and. another 10-15%
will follow. “After all,” the man
said, “I can make better money
elsewhere.” '

Okay, Harrisburg. It’s up to you.

If you think this is really the only
way to cut down the state budget, -
go to it. But ﬁve years from now,
when you ﬁnd yourselves negotia-
ting with a powerful educational
union, don’t be surprised. You’ll
have only yourselves to blame.

By the way, legislators, the '
Pennsylvania Manual reports that
in 1972 you each were being paid -
$15,000, plus $5,000 for “clerical
expenses,” plus 12 cents per mile
for the distance traveled between’
your homes and Harrisburg. At‘ -2.‘
300 miles round trip between
Pittsburgh and Harrisburg times~50
weeks (one trip each week), that’s
another $3,800 per year. You’d

New Tactic eededa

The June 5 issue of the Pitt News
reported that three area legislators
are critical "of Pitt students for
attempting to inﬂuence the General
Assembly’s‘ decision on Pitt fund-
ing. Senators Early and Scanlon
and House member Geisler main-
tain that students are incapable, of
having a sound opinion on this
issue. As Geisler put it, “They
(students) didn’t know or under-
stand the facts of the school’s or
the state’s budget. ’ ” Senator Early
added, “The legislators were well
aware of Pitt’s ﬁnancial needs.” If
this’ is the case, then why are Pitt
students made to suffer a 15%
tuition hike and cutbacks in
educational service? '

The tuition hike and cutbacks at
Pitt are part of a national attack on
education by both Democratic and
Republican lawmakers. At the City
University of New York, Mayor
Beame has threatened to slash $70
million from the CUNY budget. At
Boston College, the administration
leaked word that it was planning to
eliminate the Black Talent‘ pro-
gram, which has opened the doors
of Boston College to hundreds of
Black students over the ‘ past
several years.-- And students at
Brown University, Ohio State,
UCLA, and other major universities
face elimination of class sections
(resulting in larger class size), loss
of financial aid and curtailment of
important programs such as Black
Studies, Women’s Studies and
minority programs for Chicanos,
Asian Americans, etc.

Scanlon summed up our law-
makers’ attitude toward education
when he said, “Students represent
just one more thorn in the saddle
when it comes to getting more
money fromus.” One has only to
look at the declining US economy to
see why this is so. .

xBoth Democratic and Republican
politicians hope to appeal to the
voter who is feeling the pinch;
however, they are unwilling,
indeed unable, to antagonize their
big ﬁnancial contributors, "who
would resent substantial taxes on
corporate profits. So ,when
something has to be cut from the
state budget, it's usually money as
for welfare, health and education.
And when students attempt to ﬁght
these attacks, as we did at Pitt, our
legislators tell us that we shouldn't
voice our opinion--they know

. what’s good for us.

If people like Scanlon, Early and
Geisler really represented _us,.
they’d be fighting. with us.

Instead, they scurry around‘,
protecting the highpriority items 
the state budget, like payment of
millions_of dollars interest on bonds:
to the rich. Their careers depend,
on their ability to satisfy the needs
of their by ﬁnancial backers, who
couldn’t care le‘é"s" about the needs
of students. Thus, beingfriends
with these lgg_i§l31to_rs won’t help--
they have a prior commitment. '
How, then, to answer ‘these
attacks? - 0 i '

Scanlon said, “A demonstration 5 
is the worst thing for th'¢’st-l,1dents3  .'

l
K. 

 

‘ to do. Its effect would be to turn ‘us, 1 .7". '

-away from their requests.” ‘ Here .
we have our representative coming ‘_
right out and saying. that he won't
represent us if we have the nerve to
express our opinion in‘a highly"
visible manner! ‘

University of Massachusetts
students rallied on April 30 atkthe
state capitol to. protest a 10%
across-the-board budget out.
These’ 2,000 students’ forced '
Governor Michael Dukakis to- ,
promise that there would not be 7 , . 
any fee or tuition hikes. .  

Last year, 5,000 students and: “ 
teachers at the CUNY gathered at
City Hall and successfully stopped
a $17 million budget cutback and
the abolition of open admissions.
In November, 1973, studentsjfrom ‘
the Community College of ’
Allegheny, County petitioned with- ' V
out success when a tuition increase \
was announced. Then, as soon as a '
walkout and demonstration was
planned, the Board of Trustees
backed down. " -

Meetings, speak-outs,. derrion-.
strations, boycotts, pickets--this.
type of visible mass action puts
public pressure on legislators,
Board of Trustees members and
administrators. They are forced to '
make concessions -that they’d 
rather not make. That is why, ‘-,
Geisler calls demonstrations a 
display of “foolishness.”  \

The Student Government Board  
should plan now to organize a ,' jg
campaign of visible mass action 
against attacks directed at Pitt »
students. After all, if we were
ineffective using one tactic, isn’t it
only logical to adopt another? . '

Pitt students must organize tat?
meet these threats.now or continue
to bear the brunt of the recession in 6&-
the future. Stop tuition hikes! End 
the cutbacks! - V‘

Wallace as Seen-
From Other Side

In reading the July 9 issue of the
Pitt News, I was jolted by Dan
Mullholland's commentary of
George Wallace and felt compelled
to respond to the glowing and
generous remarks made in that
column about the governor of
Alabama. Perhaps thelfollowing
points will encourage Mr. Mull-
holland and others to take a second
look at the man who is apparently
one of their favorite presidential
contenders.

Quotations attributed to Govem-
or Wallace that reveal his obsessive
anti-communism and his prefer-

ences for World War II facist ,~

regimes are not the product of
vicious journalism, but are the

.results of consistent. reporting of

Wallace’s public comments. David
Broder, one of the country’s most
experienced political columnists,
recently. wrote that Wallace ex-
pressed essentially the same
sentiments in the 1968 presidential
compaign, saying, according to
Wallace’s biographer, “We should‘
have been in the trenches with
those Germans.” As Broder points

out,‘ these quotes hold the most.

.use of his

significance as an indication of
Wallace’s simplistic approach to
foreign policy issues, the same
simplicity that led Wallace to
choose a vice-presidential running
mate in 1968 who wanted the North
Vietnamese to be “bombed back
into the Stone Age.” 0

Those like Mr. Mullholland. who
proclaim the good life in the State
of'Alabama might take note of US
Census data that shows Alabama's
median income to be 48th in the
nation, a record worse than’ the
impoverished Appalachian states
of Kentucky and West Virginia.
And one out of ﬁve families ‘in
Kentucky and West Virginia.. It
would take the combined income of
at least five of those poor families
to equal the nearly $15,000 that
George Wallace made this past
year in royalties by charging his
own campaign committee for the
image, a practice
considered violative of the spirit, if
not the letter, of campaign
ﬁnancing laws. V

Mr. Mullholland is correct in his
assertion that Wallace currently
leads the list of Democratic
presidential hopefuls (excluding

Kennedy) in the polls, but he fails
to place this piece of information
into .a« more complete political
perspective. In spite of his strong

showing _in a number of 1972
primaries,

Naturally there is some trepida-
tion in reviewing a play lampooning
theatre reviewers, but I safely can
say the production is worth your
time. '

Stoppard’s tale revolves on the
fate of two critics: Moon, "a man

 

given to Hamlet-type reveries
about his fate on the theatre arts
staff of his paper as a second string

, to the unseen overlord Higgs; and

Birdboot, a chubby, salivating
lecher constantly peddling his
credibility for the proverbial “piece
of ass,” as Stoppard writes.
These two preside over a play

within the play: Muldoon -Manor is ‘

the scene for a traditional Gothic
piece concerned with broken love
affairs, madmen, murders and a
ridiculous detective known as
Inspector Hound.

While the critics pontiﬁcate on
the trashy play (the summit in the
range of the genre, invoking of God
and sociology), the play grinds

Mennen stressed the possibility
for “another kind” of theatrical
meeting place between people.
“Right now, we need to break from
society and search for roots.

The International Theatre Insti-

montage of classics and experi-

Mennen, one of the festival’s
participants, described Ingmar

and ambivilance.” Western

Robert Altman has been making
a successful--if sometimes rocky--
career of attacking different genres
and making them his own.

War movies never could be the
same after M*A*S*H, ordinary
Westerns could not make it past
Miller, and
gangster ﬂicks never could match
up to Thieves Like Us. Altman
never stays with the same genre;

the’. play. , ' '

Finally, the barrier between
critic and theater breaks down as
first Birdboot and then Moon are
drawn onto the stage and into the
play to suffer execution in a
fantastic plot concocted by none
other than, yes, the third-string
critic, who reveals himself at the
close of the play.

The staging is extremely simple:
scaffolds, a few pieces of furniture,
and lighting follow the few
requirements for the play and the
play within a play.-

The action is verbal and
gymnastic, and this is how the
production ‘of. the Real Inspector
Hound excels. Every character is
played with energyiiand enthus-

behind the scenes people, some are
the “little, people,” and one (Jeff
Goldblum as Tricycle Man) is a
delightful enigma, whose silence
and knowing smile provide a
running, commentary without
words.

Tying together all the characters
is the curious campaign of
“Replacement Party” presidential
candidate Walker, a sort of
combination Eugene McCarthy and
George Wallace carried to the
typical [atypical?] Altman absur-
dit Included in Walker’s

playing at the Warner Theatre.

own: the Altman film.

And now comes. his newest and

most assuredly monumental,
Nashville. The ﬁlm is five days in
the famed music city, looking at the
lives of 24 characters (25 actually;
the “25th is the never-appearing
politician Hal Phillip Walker,
whose presence‘ nevertheless is
ubiquitous).

Getting involved in the lives of 24
characters may sound more con-
fusing than it really is. That
number is more natural than the
typical movie “coincidences” of
three of four characters constantly
bumping into each other.

Here, there is frequent interac-
tion among the characters (al-
though a few pairs do not meet (as
they touch each other’s lives, often
without knowing it. There is no
singly central or main character--
each of the 24 actors has (more or
less) an equal role. Some, of
course, portray the big stars of
Nashville, some are important

platform are such items as taxing
the churches and a national
primary. _

Running the Nashville sector of

‘the campaign is John Triplette

(Michael Murphy), whose slight
resemblance to the Kennedy family
seems to be deliberately enhanced
by his hairstyle, clothes "and
mannerisms. Working with him
locally is ~ Delbert Reese (Ned
Beatty), an oily enough lawyer who
caters mainly to the stars, one of
whom is his wife, Linnea (Lily
Tomlin).
The lead white singer of a black
gospel group, Linnea is one of the
few “genuine people” in the
star-studded world of Nashville;
she quietly takes care of her home
and her two adoring, deaf children.
The most‘ moving scene in the film
is her conversing with her children
(in sign language) as the insensi-
tive and uncomfortable Delbert
looks on. A

iasm; certainly the actors enjoy the 

parody as ‘much as the audience
does.

In short it is very good.

In these hard times, it does make

sense for an experimental group .

such as the Lab to produce this kind
of lighter piece, however, the sharp
attach on theatre criticism for its
insularity and lack of artistic
concern isn’t lost in the bigger

picture of the Lab’s experimental

work. ' 

Certainly if theater people are to
rebel against the constraints L of
criticism and insensitivity, they
could choose no-better weapon than

Tom (Keith Carradine in a role thaticz

seems to be a maturation of his 3
earlier Altman roles) a scene in...

which both try to neatly hurt others  
to avoid getting hurt themselves. , .

Tom also gets himself involved
with Mary (Cristina Raines), the‘ -

second part of his trio Bill (Allan '

as a BBC journalist, Opal (Geral-If

Opal is one of the. more
deliberately satiric characters [a
sort of neat comeback to all those
British films about the uncouth
Americans]. Her pseudosophisti-
cation and complete lack of
practicality and propriety create a7
character who, though not com-
pletely insensitive or stupid, cannot
be embarassed. She seems to be

those too egotisitical to know when .

. One of the more interesting pairs
of characters who never meet
(mainly because they can't stand
each other), are the two queens of
country music. First, there’s
Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley, an

acting‘ debut), the very fragile

brunette, just recovered from a .
nervous breakdown and still having _

a rough time getting on her
emotional feet, who always appears .
in a long white gown as though she

her phony country-music smile in a

really has very little on-screen

In roles that Black would have.

tion can be.used to further the
technical and physical require-
ments of the theater company.
Certainly they are going to pack
them in tight.

But money isn’t everything, and
perhaps the Pittsburgh City Play-
er’s production of DRACULAl
proves the point. '

Based on the classic gothic-
psychological novel by Bram
Stoker, the concepts of Dracula
have a weird ability to survive time
and time again in books, movies,
short stories and television.

The underlying themes of blood

as spiritand bond reach back into -

the twilight of civilization, and the
recurring theme of God or ‘Nature
punishing mankind for its explora-
tions and attempts at godhood
through supernatural or super-
scientiﬁc. monsters can be traced
back to the epic of Beowulf.

In this form the Dracula, as
written by Stoker, is more easily

understood as a classic because it ..

deals with something that Western
Civilization, and indeed almost all

' cultures, has examined over and

I

.ﬂ;:,

over since prehistoric times:
retribution for Prometheus.

But Dracula has its more
inv/olving moments on another
plane: the superstitious dread of
deadmen coming alive, the twisted
terrains of Transylvania, and, _of
course, the blood-sucking.

DRACULA! chooses neither of .

these themes, but jumbles them

-* together, the spiritual and.psycho-
.. /logical right up next to a Gran

performance must cover the
essential developments of the
book, the first visit to Transylvania,
the madhouse, the letters between
Miss Lucy and Mary, the gradual
transformation of Lucy into a
vampire and her execution, and
Dracula’s ﬁnal destruction, col-
lapse into a confusion of running
bodies and strained German
accents.

The concept is brilliant; there is
enough material in Dracula to
spawn a million classic interpreta-
tions, but the haste with which the
characters must be introduced in
this production destroys any sort of
empathy with their suffering.

The play shines in two moments,
one of horror and the other of
psychology. Early in the play
Dracula beats two thristing vam-
pire women off his intended victim,
and as a treat, tosses them a small
child in an act filled with
monstrosity and horror. 

Much later, the ultimate hero of
the play, the Doctor Van Helsing,
Dracula’s antithesis, and Dracula
himself battle over the soul of the
vampire’s second victim, at beauti-
ful girl named Mary, in a haunting
religious sequence. '

For sheer entertainment, how-
ever, -the play is wonderful. The
lighting and set design are
excellent and the special effects are
unexpected: for instance, when
Dracula, nearly trapped by, his
hunters, takes ﬂight over the
center stage to escape.

The characters seem out of,

proportion, however, perhaps be-
cause their parts have no time for
development. ~

As I said before, however,
DRACULA! leaves the real vam-
pire fan with a faint gnawing in the

pit of the stomach. As ﬂash and".

gore and carnival, it is a fine
performance.

\ But be forewarned, leave your
literature and insight at home.

Nashville one of the most memor- .

Outdoors is another story. The

Every year Pitt holds its Invitation-

shattered due in part to the
extremely fast surface.

And of course seating is no

But Banner has departed and his
_aide has also taken over the head

the younger breed of coaches.

“Gus” began his coaching
career as an assistant at Alliquippa
High\.School after graduating from
Slippery Rock State College where
he was a hammer thrower. .

ln._1968 Agostinella moved to Mt.
Lebanon High to become an
assistant before becoming head
coach in 1970. During his four
years at Mt. Lebo his teams racked
up a 24-8 dual meet record plus
many WPIAL and state titles.

Last year when assistant coach
Smitty Brown returned to school for
his Masters Degree Mike moved to
Pitt. With his concentration on
field events the Panthers showed

much improvement over the-

previous season including coaching
the kid with the longest javelin
throw in the country as a
freshman--Mike Matter. .

in a while about his size (Gus is
certainly not a small person to say
the least).

Although appearing to be all fun
and games on the outside he can
also be very serious and can scream
with the best in the country,
something every coach must do at
least once in awhile.

A new challenge will await
Agostinella when the track season
begins. Pitt has formally with-

drawn from the creaky, old Eastern

Collegiate Athletic Conference and
has become a member of the
Central Collegiate Track Confer-
ence. .
Competition will be stiff from the
midwest with schools such as Kent
State, Michigan State and Ohio
providing competition for the

, Panthers.

With the resignation of two very
successful coaches being replaced
by two younger,-more volatile men
the question comes to mind, “Is
this a precedent for the future?”
As time passes more and more
coaches are retiring to let the
younger man take over. Of course
some of this is bound to happen but
today it seems to occur more and
more frequently.

Perhaps the reason for the big
swing to youth in the college ranks
is the makeup of today’s athlete.
Most athletes today live inside a
pressure cooker all of their lives as
do most people today. However,
being the “student-athlete” takes
more out of a person. The desire to
achieve in his particular sport plus
maintaining agrade point average
above .001 is not always ‘easy.
