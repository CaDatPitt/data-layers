Chancellor Posvar was to meet
today with Public Interest Re-
search Group to discuss the re-
cent administrative refusal to act
as collection agent for PIRG con-
tributions.

renti said the group wouldlseek
to "assure PIRG will be on the
agenda of the next Board of Trus-
tees meeting," March 14, and to
clear up administrative" "miscon-
ceptions” of the goals and func-
tions of PIRG. ‘

If the Chancellor refuses to
place PIRG on the Trustees’ agen-
da, Varrenti said PIRG members
will appeal directly to the Board

F ifthDimension, mystery play,

by BOB GEDEKOH

In 1954, it came to the attention of several Pitt *

engineering students that St. Patrick was one of the
first engineers. After all, hadn’t he developed the
first worm drive when he drove the snakes out of
Ireland? So Patrick was immediately proclaimed
the patron saint of engineers and Engineers Week
was introduced to honor him.

This year. the 18th-annual Engineers Week will

be highlighted by a Fifth Dimension concert. an-

Agatha Christie mystery play, a dance at the
Churchill Valley Country Club. parties, a soap box
derby. and cigar smoking, egg throwing, pole climb-
ing. ear pulling and tug of war contests,a11 coupled
with a reprieve from classes. The festivities will
run from March 13-18.

The Engineering Studentilabinet has toned down
the traditional competition between the various en-

gineering departments this yearin hopes of making‘

the festivities more rewarding to both departmen-

_tal participants and non-engineering students as

well.

Formerly, the entire program was centered
around interdepartmental competition for the cov-
eted Shamrock Award. This year, only three com-
petitive events are being included in the program:

Game Night, the Soap Box Derby, and Gimmick,

Day. ‘

The festivities will open Monday with the an-
nual parade of departmental floats down Bigelow
Blvd. and Fifth Ave, concluding at Benedum Hall.

highlight Engineers’ festivities

Local disc jockey Jim Quinn will host the opening
ceremonies, which will be highlighted by the tradi-
tionally outlandish arrival of Saint Patrick, who
popped out of a manhole. one year, and pulled up in
a ‘sheik‘s limousine—complete with harem—the
next. _ ~~ ' g V i
Departmental teams will compete in ear pull-
ing, cigar smoking, greased pole climbing, egg
throwingand tug of war events Tuesday afternoon
during Gimmick Day on thelawn of the Cathedral.
All interested students are welcome to participate
at'ter the departmental competition is completed.

The festive mood will be maintained Tuesday
with Game Night on the sixth and seventh floors of
Benedum Hall. Game booths representing each en-
gineering department will attempt to entice par-
ticipating students to spend their free tokens at
their booths. All Pitt students are welcome.

The Mousetrap, a Christie mystery play which
has been ru'nning for 20 years in London. will be
presented by engineering students Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. in the auditori-
um of Benetdum Hall.

The play. under the direction of Chris Wendt. a
graduate of Pitt’s Drama Department. is being in-
cluded to prove that engineers can do more than
push slide rules. Admission will be $1.

The serious aspects of engineering are being
represented by student lab project displays. And
the engineers are sponsoring benefit collections

for a- review of the administra-
tion's decision.

Varrenti does not expect the
meeting with Posvar to be suc-
cessful.

"They (the administration)
don’t"want us to go to the Board
of Trustees,“ she said.

Dr. Ray Coble-, executive‘as-
sistant to the Chancellor, indi-
cated Monday that the Chancel-
lor‘s meetingwith PIRG would
not necessarily launch a review

or a reversal of the original ad-‘

ministrative veto.

“The administration is follow-

ing its’ practice of talking with
concerned .students about their
problems,” he said.

Coble arranged the meeting af-
ter several PIRG supporters tele-

phoned the Chancellor’s office

Monday morning to urge such an
action. '

Although -‘PIRG petitioners

-amassed 9,000 student signatures
urging the administration to col-
lect PIRG fees on the academic

‘ invoices, the administration re-

fused, questioning the legality of
such a procedure, the precedent
it might set for other student

groups desiring funding, Pitt's

fiduciary responsibilities, and the
ire it might incur with the State
Legislature.,

Western Pennsylvania PIRG,

coordinator Kathy Kadana ac-
cused the administration of suf-
fering from “hysteria.”

PIRG lawyer Bernard Marcus
said the administration is “rais-
ing the legal issues to cloud the
area."

Varrenti, however, concluded
that the administration simply
has misconceptions about the
PIRG plan. She argued that the
University would notbe liable for
PIRG actions because PIRG is a

corporate entity.

She further declared that the
University has already set a pre-
cedent for separate funding of
student activities, as _the Black
Action Society is funded through

the Provost's office rather than ,.

through student activities fees.

PIRG is causing controversy on
other local campuses too.

. by' SUE HOENSTINE’

A bill recently approved by

the Pa. House of Representa-

_ tives would make students who

_?; register to vote in another state
ineligible for state scholarships.

, _Part of a 67-bill package to
give adult status to 18-year olds,
_,the legislation was sponsored by
__:"_Rep. -Mitchell W. Melton, who
I called it “an attempt to encour-
. ‘agestudents to retain voting sta-

 , Charles Dees, Pitt’s Associ-
.5.‘ ate Director of Student Aid, es-
 timated that about 12,000 Penn-
 sylvanians are now attending
 out of state ‘institutions and re-
I ceiving state scholarships. Their
scholarships are costing the
 state between seven and eight
' million dollars.

 * HDees could not predict how

 ‘would affect state funds.

.  c “It is hard to say how many of

A. state elections by absentee bal-
_" lot,” he said. V
’ James Gallagher, Chairman

‘gmittee, offered an amendment

 "students from 21 to 18 who, by

tent of obtaining state scholar-

If out-of-state students are per-
mitted to establish residency in
Pennsylvania at 18 and be eli-
gible for in-state tuition rates,
Dees predicted, “more out-of-
state students would be willing
to attend Pennsylvania state-
related Universities.

"The number of out-of-state
students has declined over the
years at Pitt and Temple, since
the institutions went state-re-
_lated,” Dees noted. ‘

sidered the bill. -

Committee to rework drug bills

by GLENDA MINSHULL

A joint Pa. House and Senate conference com-
mittee will meet within the next few weeks to re-
solve. differences between the drug laws passed by

each body.

Last July the House passed the original bill
aimed at curbing drug addiction and reducing
the penalty for possession of marijuana from a
felony to a misdemeanor carrying a 30-day, $500

maximum penalty.

Also included in the House measure is a pro-
visionallowing first time offenders the opportun-
ity to have their records expunged under the "civil
commitment option.“ which requires offenders to ‘
participate in a state-sanctioned rehabilitation pro-

gram. -

However, the more conservative Senate ver-
sion eliminates the “-civil commitment” provision.

' This. said Rep. Milton Berkes, D-Bucks, sponsor of
the House bill, makes it difficult for defendants to ‘
clear their records.

Another difference to be resolved. by the con-
ference committee is the Senate’s realignment

of the proposed Governor‘s Council on Drug and

Alcohol Abuse.

The House version calls for a 15-member board,
empowered to set up programs and if necessary
reallocate funds from existing programs which in
the Councils opinion are not being effectively

The Senate bill reduces the proposed council .
to seven members and strips it of its program veto

Berkes is disappointed by the proposed weaken-
ing of the council’s powers.

"It is the ultimate weapon to make sure money A
allocations are used,” he said.

Besides these mechanical dif-

Potenzone said that despite its

“We want to emphasize that

Many instructors hadn’t yet

MANCHESTER, N. H. (AP) -
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine
won the New Hampshire primary
Tuesday night, outpolling Sen.
George McGovern and -a field of
Democratic challengers, but
struggling for the landslide per-
centage he called his phantom op-
ponent.

President Nixon swept ‘to an

easy Republican victory over two
GOP rivals.

“We have every cause to be
pleased,” the challenger from
South Dakota said. “We appear to
be holding about one-third of the
vote. I don’t think Muskie is go-
ing to get"50 per cent.”

With 48 per cent of the expect-
ed vote counted, the Democrats
lined up this way:

——Muskie, 18,541, or 48 per cent;
—McGovern, 13,225, or 34 per

opponent’ spo

——Sen. Vance Hartke of Indiana,
1,332, or three per cent, and

—Sen,. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, 315 write-in
votes, or one per cent.

In the Republican contest, 23
per cent of the expected vote had
been counted, and Nixon had 18,-
245 votes, or 70 per cent. "

Rep. Paul N. McCloskey of Cali-
fornia was second, with 4,947, or

A persomil touch for McGovern

Student canvassers brave coldi

by PAULA YURKOVICH

In spite of bone-chilling cold, drifting snow,
and a‘12. hour drive, about 40 Pitt volunteers
for Senator George McGovern spent a week-
.end or_two canvassing in rural areas of New
Hampshire.

This state,where the first presidential primary
in the nation was held yesterday, has been a
major target of presidential aspirants.

The duty of the volunteer was to go from door
to door discussing with willing listeners McGov-
ern’s stands on pertinent issues. If the listener
looked none too enthusiastic or merely in a hurry,
the-canvasser' simply distributed literature. Be-
cause it is possible to register for the polls up to’
one week before the primaries in New Hampshire,
canvassers also urged voter registration.

,- Suzanne McDevitt, one of the Pitt campaign-

ers, felt the canvassing students were well re-

ceived in New "Hampshire, especially in the rural

' areas and the developing communities. McDevitt

reported that some people invited the canvassers
in their homes for political discussions. topped
off with coffee and a welcome chance to ward
off frostbite. ,

McDevitt admitted that canvassing long hours

but ‘she, temred it one of the most valid and hon-
est means of campaigning. “Lots of mediaand no
people tend to make people skeptical,” she said.
“A personal touch is needed.”

McDevitt added that a very embarrassing
incident took place a few weeks ago in Peter-
borough, New Hampshire when some dedicated
McGovern followers passed out leaflets to a well
dressed man on the street before they realized
he was Senator Muskie.

Workers for McGovern get no pay for the
hours they spend canvassing in all sorts of
weather. Instead, they feel a sense of accom-
plishment from the involvement. knowing that
they are reaching some people who take a mo-
ment to listen. McGovern’s national campaign
headquarters reimburses the workers for travel
expenses only.

So take heart, canvassers‘. No more cold,

next will emphasize Pennsylvania’s primary on
April 25. The weather here should be compara-

went to other states more students can be in-
volved in a significant primary in our own back-

Congress, if he did not gain 20 per
cent of the GOP vote. ‘

Muskie began complaining about .

a phantom opponent as public
opinion polls .showed' his New
Hampshire rating dipping during
the waning days of the campaign.

‘The Maine senator said in ad-
vance that political analysts
would measure the outcome not
in terms of a victory over his
Democratic rivals, but against a
landslide standard they would set
after the balloting. ‘

McGovern said his second-place _

showing “gives a leg up on every-
one else. '

“How we did here, on what was
thought to be Muskie turf, is go-
ing to give us a big boost across
the country,” he said.

“We’re doing much better than
anyone expected.”

Sen. Robert J. Dole of Kansas,
Republican national chairman, is-
sued a statement saying that the
New Hampshire primary results
reflect “the judgment that the

What would make a carload of students
from Pittsburgh travel for 14 hours to this
small town . . . through interstates with
exits .but no entrances to get back on; a
rented Hertz car which fish tails above 55;
radio stations which stretch the limits of
sanity by playing the same '10 songs ev-
ery hour; a passing lane half covered with
snow which wins when it throws your car
off the road; missing an exit off the inter-
state,»coming back, missing it again be-
cause of blinding snow thrown up by care-
less cross-country truckers barrelling by
at 70 mph?

Perhaps it is partly the adventure of
leaving Pittsburgh and touring scenic New
Hampshire. But to drive that distance-
650 miles—without something more

than a pretty town at the end would have ~

been alet-down.

' Canvassing Keene for McGovern was
"what made the trip worthwhile. There was
the woman committed to Wallace, the sexy
high school girl dedicated to McClosekey,
the 16 year old who couldn’t vote but would
relay what you said. to his voting-aged
brother detained in‘ the bathtub; the young

vet back from service ‘on Guam who‘
' thought a write-in vote -for Wallace
would be a ‘more effective vote against .

It is talking to people which makes it

worthwhile. It is the feeling of communi-
cating with another person. Of listening.
Of understanding. Of caring about an-
other’s beliefs. And when you share
these views. a bond is found.

You desire not only to find out what an-
other believes, but to know why. Perhaps
to convince him of his mistake, perhaps
to recognize yours, perhaps to come away

'3.

with the feeling that your views are in-.

compatible. . . . But at least tofcome away
with the feeling that you tried to communi-
cate something you believed. ’

It is not very hard today to find apathy
for politics. Perhaps {if more people would
experience the, human contact aspects of

‘ politics, of working for a candidate, of feel-

ing the satisfaction of working for some-
thing you believe in, there would be a more
optimistic mood in the country today.

Unfortunately, so many look at the af-
termath\of McCarthy’s crusade as proof
that nothing can be changed. They tried and
ended up very disillusioned people. But to-
day, it is easier to make animprint. Peo-
ple can change voters’ minds, not through

 

dropping of literature in mail boxes, but -

by talking to people, by making them feel‘

their views are important enough to be
heard.

Maybe change is impossible,‘ but we

"should at leasttry for ourselves before

quitting.

Even if 1972 becomes a yea-rlof disap-
pointment, we can at-least say people tried
to accomplish something, and that with
a little more help from ome friends, we
just may make it next time.

Administrators ‘regret’ ’

The Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education, having beenasked for P‘
a statement of its position regarding the student organizing effort on
the campuses of member colleges and universities, has taken the re-
quest under collective consideration. .

'1. We are" solidly in"_favor of student involvement in the process of '
seeking solutions to the complex social issues of the day. On our cam-
puses, eachin-accordfwith its own procedures‘, we are willing to rec_-
ognize the groups being formed as valid student organizations. ’

2. Many such groups arenow concerned with research andstudy ’
of the problems of ecology and consumer protection. This work should
produce proposals that will improve the quality of life in Western Penn-
’ sylvania. We view the attempts bystudents to bring their energy, in-
g fluence, concern, and leadership to bear on these problems as com-
3 mendablecommitments to civic and regional betterment. P

E 3. We regret, however, that we are all,unable to approve the pro- 1
 posal that the respective colleges and universities collect from students P ’
 a fee. for PIRG through tuition or-fee channels. This positionwe have _, .~.
 adopted on advice of counsel and in consideration of our fiduciary re-'

15,000 to be drafted in

second quarter year

WASHINGTON tAPl—Issuing the first draft call in five months,
Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird announced Monday that 15,-

000 men will be drafted into the Army during April, May. and
June.

The call was the first since October when the Pentagon clos-
ed out 1971 with a 10.000-man quota spread over the final three
months of the year.

No draft calls were issued during the first quarter of 1972 as
Pentagon officials waited to determine whether more than $3 bil-
lion in new military pay increases generated enough volunteers to
fill its manpower needs. Another factor was a congressional order to
trim 70,000 men from the Army by June 30. - A

The administration is trying to achieve an all volunteer force
by mid-1973. The Army exceeded slightly its 15.000-man enlistment
goal for January but fell short by more than 3,000 in February.

"We're making progress." Laird told the winter meeting of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He said the draft was 300,000 in
1969. the year he took office; 200,000 in 1970, 98000 last year, “and
this year we will reduce those calls to 50000 or less."

This will enable the Nixon administration to fill its military
needs in an election year with the smallest draft since before the
Korean War. The last time draft calls fell below 50.000 was in 1949
when 9.781 men were inducted.

Selective Service sources said it's likely that young men with
lottery numbers above 60 will be safe from the draft this year.

Penn State gays continue legal- ha

tion would conflict with the _pol-
icies of the counseling and guid-
ance center of the university.

At this time members of the
organization contacted the Pitts-
burgh Law Collective. which

accepted the case. Because the

organization was not chartered.
it could not legally file suit. So
four Penn State students agreed
to represent the organization.
Joseph _Acanfora and Karen
Swartz, both members of HOPS'.
and John Thornton and Barbara
Spears, who are not members" of

-' HOPS but are students concern-

ed with the policies of the ad-

‘ ministration. agreed to serve! as

plaintiffs for the organization.

Three" days after the suit was_

filed Acanfora was dismissed
from his student teaching assign-
ment at ParklForest Junior High
School. Rick Isaacson, a Pitts-

burgh Law Collective attorney,-

alleges that although the uni-
versity knew about. Acanfora’s
membership in HOPS since last
‘March; it‘ made no effort to
notify the Junior AHigh’s adminis-

‘ tration until the suit was filed.

Although only
were left in Acanfora’s teaching
assignment and he had received
only good comments from his
supervisors. the Penn
administration told him that there

three weeks _

be placed in another school in
the state.
«He was told that he should
either drop out of school for good.
or reapply next year in hopes of
being allowed to complete his
student teaching. '
At this point, the Pittsburgh
Law Collective filed a second
suit against the university ad-
ministration and the local school
system charging that Acanfora‘s
civil rights were being violated.
The case was won on February 21
and Acanfora was reinstated to

‘ his former assignment and given

credit for the days he missed

A by DIANE H_OLLINGSWORTH

In spring. when most students are headed for
home. or Florida, some return to. these hallowed

halls of learning.

Reasons vary widely. fro.m "I like the atmos-
phere in the spring." to “Because I want to get out
of here!“, or as one biology major put it. “Be-

cause I‘m dumb, that's why!"

For some -ambitious souls. Spring Term offers
dreams of earlier graduation. "I can graduate a_
‘year early by going both spring and summer'.'7 , -

stated Mary'Gasior. a sophomore.

One‘ student was in a hurry for a different
reason. “Im hoping to get through as-gsoon as pos- * '
sible,”. she explained. “I’m not-married and I have
a baby, bu-t I?m getting married this summer.”

Many students are utilizing Spring Session

I while waiting for job opportunities in June.

during the controversy.

Penn State’s lawyers offered
no defense at the trial, and Isaac-
son (the Pittsburgh Law Collec-
tive attorney,) conjectures that
they knew they would lose the
suit, but decided to allow— the
courts to make the decision so
that public pressure would be re-
moved from the university.

lsaacson maintains that the
members of the Penn State
administration pointedly told

Acanfora that he should have
notified them before filing the
original suit to have HOPS re-

\admitted to the student activities

administration notified the Junior
High School concerning Acanforas
activities in retaliation for the
first suit.

At present the Law Collective
is pursuing its suit against the
University concerning the admis-
sion of HOPS to the activities
program. They are also asking
that the administration refrain
from- harassing student mem-
bers of the organization. and that
lawyers" fees-and legal costs of
the suit be paid as punitive. dam-
ages by Penn State.

A Session’ looms rather ominously ahead.

Marlene Sullivan said. "I'm taking Organic

Pharmacy School." Discussing the same course.

Barbara Brozovick. a senior. remarked, "I'll need

all the help I can get."

‘ While many studentsrush to register for Spring
Session. Linda Metzer, an employee in the Regis-
_tration Office. is not convinced of its merits.

"I wouldn‘t go in the spring,‘
"It would interfere with my vacation."

For connoisseurs of the abstract.

ed woodcutter and painter from
Weston. Massachusetts.

On display are 25 paihtings.

awhile, however, the shapes be-

Bulwinkle is a Pitt graduate,

other than printmaking. which
‘he. studied under George ‘Nama.
The untaught artist evidently has

The $40 "asking price seems
rather steep for these works;
one would probably be wiser
to blindly invest the money in
the stock market.

Lean rolled into one. Their re-
actions were warm and enthu-
siastic as they hissed at Henry
Luba’s delightfully sinister vil-
lain and wildly applauded Jeff
Boudov’s rousing musical rendi-
tion of “Croquet.” '

They were charmed by Fran-
cine Nemitz as the French
maid and were awed by the
brilliant performance of Bert
Nemitz as the farmer from Cat-
taraugus. In addition, the audi-
ence was inspired by the smooth
and skillful performance of
James Berry as Count Jolimatre
and by the captivating perform-
ances of Kate Hauck and, Den-
nis Grossman.

The comic triumph of Mary
Jacobs Ford as Mary Tiffany and

Richard Picchiarini as -Z-eke

made them role in their chairs '

while the fine performances of
Mark Huberman (Mr. Tiffany»
and Candy Marvel (Seraphina)
equally delighted them.

With ‘such reactions, the au-
dience showed its enjoyment of
a show that is an odd mixture
of Jeanette McDonald and
Nelson Eddie, W. C. Fields,
Pappy Joe, Scrooge, Lord Ten-
nyson, and Poor Nel; in other
words, a show as difficult to
describe as is the aura of vaude-
ville that it creates.

The story centers on
fashionability of French“customs
that occupy the time of the
rich and elite in New York so-
ciety in the 1840’s when. the

Knights supreme in  

1

battle with all-stars

, g by BART MACK ,
Jeff Garvey scored the hat trick in the first period and assist-
ed on two other goals in the second to lead the Pittsburgh Knights

over the College All-Stars,
Chalet. M

The all-stars kept it close only
during the first period and tr-ailed
the Knights by 3-1 after the
first '15 minutes. The stars put
pressure on the Knights early in
the game, getting the power play

at the 14:03 mark. Knight goalie

Jim Chandler repelled a number

_ of shots in succesion to"sty"miei

the stars. ‘ . '

The Knights then picked up the

momentum when Garvey litthe
red lamp twice" in a 30 ‘second
span. Mike Kenworthy, C-MU’s
league—leading scorer; then let
loose with a screen shot from 25
feet out to beat Chandler. Garvey
pickedup his third goallater in
the period to round out the first
period scoring.

Don Rizzo opened the second
period with a quick pair of
goals for the Knights and put the

V , .same game -relatively out of the

 all-star's’ reach.’ ,Pitt’s Denny

Browne battled back with an all-
star s’ power play goal at 9:03
mark. Browne, who was stationed‘
in the crease, deflected a boom-.
ing Glenn Hyde slap shot from
the. point that trickled -past
_Chandler. '

. .But the Knights continued to?
' pour it on and followed Browne,
' 23 seconds later, with a goal by

Mike Sigfried whobeat Penn State
(McKeesport) goalie Les Phil-
lips. The Knights scored again at

-_ the 11:27 mark then the all-stars
retaliated with their final goal of

1 .. _ Associate Sports Editor _ _
Big time-—a phrase sometimes used about the Pitt Athletic
Department. If one considers that Pitt’s scores in football and
basketball are announced on TV before such schools as Muhlen-
berg and Gonzaga, then Pitt is truly big time.
But if many other things are used as criteria,»
-. may not adequately describe the present situation.

Judging the department as mediocre because of its present
lack of one solid Eastern or national contender in any of its
dozen sports would be unfair to the present regime of coaches
and administrators. Present comparisons of each club with its
‘ predecessor of fiveyears ago isfavorable- .

It’s “a lot of little things” that coaches andathletes speak
about that leave me with_the impression that Pitt sports have a
long way to advance before they achieve big time status.

“Between you and me” and “this is off the record, but"-—
have become well-worn expressions by athletes and coaches in
their discussions of gripes with me.-Certainly, none of the com-
' plaints are directly responsible for 5657 losses and fourth place
finishes. Rather, the accumulation of these feelings breed some-
thing less than‘ an all—around positive, winning attitude. H

Football as kingbasketball as its crown prince and"
and other teams as peasants on the hill is at metaphorical rep-_
resentation of many athletes’ impressions. Though members of
other squads realize that these two'sp_orts are the only money-
rnakers,certainpiolicies arequestioned byathletes.  A I

Pitt’s Kevin Love,‘ Eastern champ at I 50, has de-
cided not to attend the Nationals due -to a knee in-
jury and disagreements with Coach Dave Adams.

by MARK SIGMON

. While Oklahoma State, Iowa State, Washington,
and Michigan State battleit out for the team cham-
pionship, Kevin Love (150), John “Bimbo” Chat-
man (158), Jim Fleming (167), and Craig Tritch
(190) will represent Pitt at the NCAA wrestling
tournament tomorrow through Saturday at Mary-
land University’s 12,500-seat Cole Field House.

Winners of the 1970 title, the Iowa State Cyc--

lones were dethroned last year by an aroused Okla-

homa State Cowboy juggernaut. Nevertheless, hav- I

ing suffered only one loss this season (17-16 to

a Washington), the number one ranked Cyclones are

favored to regain the team championship.

I -The Big Eight champion Cowboys are excep-
tionally tough in the lower weights,with Yoshiro Fu-

sjita (126), Mike Riley (134), Bobby Stites (142),
, ' and Jay Arneson (150). Dan Strode at 177 is a possi-

bleplace winner. , _ _
Led.by returning champions Carl Adams (158)-

and Ben Peterson (190), the Cyclones are very for- -

midable in the last five weights. Only Phil Parker
(134) appears capable of placing in the lower weight
classes for Iowa St. -

The Washington Huskies are paced by three poten-
tial middlevveight victors, Larry Owings (142), Ha-
jime Shinjo (150), and Don Pleasant (158).‘ Mean-
while, the Michigan State Spartans are a ,wel1-bal-
anced squad, although ohly 118 pounder Greg John-
son seems likely to cop first place. ,

4 A weight-by-weight breakdown lists the "top
contendersas follows: . - ,

ll8—Hoping toannex his third straight NCAA

crown," Johnson will _have his hands full with 1971

‘runner-up Tom Schuler (Navy), Oklahorna’s Gary
Breece, Don Fay (Lock Haven), and Iowa’s Dan 

Sherman, a mid-season All—American.

H _ 126—Fujita, like his Japanese countryman "Yo-

_]lI‘O Utake was back in 1964-66, is untouchable.

There will be a fierce struggle for the remaining,
places with, 1972 runnerup Mark Massery (North-

western), F&M’s Chris Black, UCLA’_s John Meikle, '

and—Michigan’s Jim Hagen among the challengers.
134—A Parker-and-Riley bout may well decide

the team title in the finals. Mike Ellis (MSU), Bob
.Medine (PSU), Cal.Poly’s Larry Morgan, and Port- '

land State’s Bob Bergen are formidable entries.

142—The only grappler to_ever beat the legend-
ary Dan Gable, Owings is favored to garner his sec-

ond title. -Nevertheless, yNavy’s Lloyd’ Keaser is no '

slouch, and Torn Milkovich (MSU), Stites,’ Cal
Poly’s Glen Anderson, and Ashland’s Jim Guizzotti

 denounced. while the disparity in training table operations_ is
/criticized. After football season is over, the quality of the food.’
-‘/_is drastically cut for the other athletes. -1 ‘ - ‘-

Assignment of scholarships and financial priorities for pub-a 
licity, travel expenses, and equipment present more points of‘
contention for many. While realizing that-football and basket--5}
‘ball always receive the lion’s share of the resources, many won’-
der how their respective programs can ever become agbig win-[
‘her under the present situation. 1_ , 
Finally a lack of communication between the individucalf
athletes and the Athletic Department hierarchy seems to exist;
A good example of this occurred this week—Panther eager Jim;
Bolla, who was injured in December, isseeking a medical 'red-'.;
shirt, but has heard little about the progress of his.application_f
for it. Although Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski assuyrewd ine-
. that the proper means are being taken carezof. Bolla has ‘been
unsure of his status forseveral months. I 1 ‘
Additionally, members of the “minor” sports team are un-
happy about the non—prescence of department personnel at any
of their contests through a season. V ‘i _ . . ' — 
A~—winning football team will solve most of these problems‘
in the long run. With large increased revenues from the grid-'_;

by MARK SIGMON

Despite having qualified for the NCAA
tournament for the third consecutive year,
junior Craig Tritch (190) is not satisfied with
his 1971-72 grappling performance.

“I did not have a good dual meet season,"
admitted Tritch. “I don’t really know why.
Maybe it was "those three losses in a row’ at
the beginning.”

After being mauled by Oregon State's Greg
Strobel at the Lehigh Quad, Craig suffered
subsequent defeats against Navy and Mary-
land. Tritcli feels this losing string; may have
affected his confidence.

Following a 6-5-2 regular season mark, 0

Tritch wrestled exceptionally well in the East-
ern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association
(EIWA) championships and finished fourth at
190. - .

Commenting on his Eastern performance,
Tritch said, “I won four of six bouts at Tem-

'ple. Both the Easterns and the Nationals are
-really endurance contests as soon as you en-

ter the consolation rounds.

“I don’t want to make any excuses, but I '
get stiff while waiting around in between con- ‘

solation matches. Besides, my knee which I
injured earlier in the year, still bothers me.”

“Physically, I’m in "pretty good shape,”
stated Craig. “Running every morning and
afternoon helps build up your endurance. My

comnoniue HIS opponent, Craig Tritch ( we)

to stay at 190.”

A native of Middletown,,Pa., Tritch was a
high school mat standout at Lower Dauphin
H. S. Although Franklin and Marshall, Le-
high, Penn, and several state colleges offered
him scholarships, Craig accepted Coach Dave
Adams’ “full b0at’f».offer and" came to Pitt.

Married for several years now, and the
proud father of a two-year.old daughter; named
Cinnamon,‘ Tritch has his share of problems.

“It's tough carrying a full academic load,
wrestling, and being married,” sighed Tritch.
“Probably the roughest part is the usual fi-
nancial headaches my wife and I run into,
even though I am on a scholarship.

Tritch does not care if there are poor home

turnouts for Panther wrestling meets. He

believes that if Pitt could win “33 matches in
a row like Penn State,” there would be big

crowds at the Field House, and the kind of in-

terest generated in the Rex Peery era of the
1950’s would return. _

Craig has generally considered his mat
career as a “means to an end.” Although he
admits he certainly gains some personal sat-

isfactionfrom winning, Tritch knows that an
» .‘‘NCAA champ wouldn’t even get a free cup
of coffee.

“I guess that I’m not all that enthusiastic
about wrestling,” confided Tritch. “I have no
sense of hate or hostility for any of my oppon-
ents on the mat. Heck, I was really good

friends with (Tom) Hartzfeld (PSU) at the
Easterns. Why in high school, I would never-

have looked at him.”

Women Ho0Pers look Playbabys

toward bright future

by RON SIEGEL

Despite a disappointing 3-4 record. Pitt women‘s basketball
Coach Sandra Bullman was pleased with the showing of the team

this year.

"This is a building year." she explained. "The girls were in-
experienced. but we should do much better next season."

The fact that the squad is los-
ing only one senior is indicative
of this situation. Onl_v forward
Jan Clouse will.not be back with
the squad next year.

Clouse’s rebounding strength
will be missed, but this should
easily be outweighed by the fur-
ther ’ development of the many
freshmen and sophomores onthe
team.

Mary Ellen Klobchar. a fresh-
man, led the team in scoring
with a 16.2 points per game aver-
age. Coach Bullman expects her
to improve next season, and
pointed out her constant improve-
ment this season as an indication;

In her last two games, she scor-—

ed 27 and 25 points respectively.
Rose Smith, another veteran
who will be returning, averaged
a little over 10 points a game.
She led the team with 18 points
against West Liberty and 11.in
the game against Carlow. She
also distinguished herself," iron-
ically enough, as the only player

to foul out of a game for Pitt-

this year. She failed to go the

route against the Youngstown
Penguins.

The hoopers dropped contests
to Kent State, Marshall Univer-
sity, Slippery Rock and Young-
stown, while they upended Car-
negie-Mellon, Carlow College,
and Edinboro enroute to their
3-4 record. ‘

In addition to having almost

all of this year_’s squad back,
Coach Bullman is expecting at.

least two new freshmen to join
the team. One is a hooper from
the Philadelphia area and the
other a branch campus transfer.
Bullman was reluctant to identi-
fy them by name.

With" all of this young talent,
it is easy to see why the squad's
optimism is running high. Coach
Bullman hopes that “Klobchar
can learn some more moves.” in
addition to ones she already has.

Bullman predicted, "We will
definitely have a winning season
nextyear.” ’

Monday night, Playboy's Pent-
house defeated PiKA Fraternity,
55-47 in a hard fought. quarter-
final game.

The victory advanced the
Playboys, dorm champs. into the
semi-finals of the all—campus
tournament. ,

Both teams exhibited well bal-

anced squads. with the Playboys
enjoying a slight height advant-

 

age. '
Pika took an earlylead on the
fine shooting of Bob Burke and
Jack Hannon. Tom Miller kept
the Playboys close as the half

ended with Pika holding a four 7

point lead, 26-22.

The second half/saw the Play-
boys. storm back to take a quick
sevengpoint lead with the hot

"hand of Dave Rugh leading the

Traeksters tame Edinboro

The Pitt track team ended its
1972 indoor, dual-meet season
with a convincing 67-46 victory
over Edinboro Monday night in
the Field House.

Depending primarily on their
“B” team performers, the track-
sters treaked to 10 firsts out of
the 13 events held". In addition, the
home team managed to sweep all
three places in the 600 yard run
and 50 yard dash.

by THE BROTHERS GRIM

Tuesday night, amid the hustle
and bustle of an evening in Oak-
land. we desperately longed for a
small reprieve from the urban
madness. A man is a green Fe-
dora suggested the highlights film
of the Pitt Panthers’ 1971 football
season entitled “A Year to Grow.“

"A year to groan. did you say?“
we inquired.

KING CAR-EL
...wirh a ‘P’?

"No, a Year to Grow," our in-
former growled like a wounded
Panther. "It’s being shown at
David Lawrence, tonight at 8.
You'd really be amazed. Go over

«s'4UbL'4JbL'4lL\'/§bL'AJD&4bL9£lD!aULL'AJ9s9.QbL'JlbL'4QbL'4J'

and seefor yourself."

We timidly entered the caver-
nous hall and ‘slithered into our
seats. As the lights dimmed and
the chatter subsided, soft, luted
music somehow resembling
“When you wish upon a star,”
soothed our anxious ears. A gold-
en shepherd strolled up and down
the aisles distributing rose color-
ed glasses to the restless onlook-

CPS. \

A churning motion on the screen
suddenly drew us into its swirl
and we found ourselves magically
transported to the Wonderful
World of Car-El. There before our
incredulous eyes appeared an
awesome figure in a red. white
and blue uniform with a bold.
brass-tinted “P" on his chest.

In a deep. bellowing drone he
proclaimed. "I am Car-El, King
of the Kittens. I possess the pow-.
er to answerlany question. Ask
me anything."

A small, sandy-haired gentle-
marrto our right, who identified
himself as the Dean Sid of the
Beelick Department inquired,
“King Car-El, what does the ‘P’
stand for on your suit of arms?”

“An astute observation my dear
fellow.” replied His Majesty.
"One -year ago I- governed the
Panthers. but alas. they have be-
come kittens."

"No Car-El." exclaimed Sid.
"You are too harsh on them. Just
view them as they really were.
down below you on the battle-

fields. As we see them now. they I

look like ferocious, untamed s\a/v-
ages."

“Hey; Sid, you must have some
magical power, for you can make
us see what you want us to see,

and hear what you want us to‘

hear,” marveled the fascinated
King.‘ “Just a- few months ago
those same savages looked like
Kittens to me‘, my court and to

‘ all the inhabitants of Car-El. How

did you do it?” ‘ -

“I thought you had all the an-
swers,” beamed the proud Dean
of Beelick. But before the King
co ld reply, Sid continued. "Just
look a little further and see what
wonders I have wrought.”

Then, to everyone’s amusement.
the Kittens, in one fell swoop

‘caged the Bruins delayed the

   
   

. Sooners, dynamited the Mountain- '

eers, torpedoed the Midshipmen.
surfed the Green Wave, and pluck-
ed the Eagles.

In rapid succession they contin-
ued by squeezing the Orange,
sweeping the Irishman,- kicking
the Army’s ass, stuffing the Lions
with cotton, and buffaloing the
Seminoles.

"I call this phenomenon ‘A Year
to Grow,"‘ hearaled the Dean of
Beelick. _

And Car-El solemnly agreed.
“Yes it isxdefinitely a year to go.
go,go....." '

Suddenly we were back in DL
Hall, and we looked at each other
and wished it were not a fairytale.
