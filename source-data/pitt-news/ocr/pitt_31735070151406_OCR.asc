Caribou coffee
shop leaves
Oakland, Peet’s
enters

Staff I/Vrizfer

An Oakland coffee shop that is popular among
students looking to study and get their caffeine
ﬁxes turned off its espresso machines for the
last time earlier this month.

But never fear, coffee lovers: The Caribou
Coffee that closed on Sept. 9 will reopen in
mid-October as Peet’s Coffee and Tea.

Caribou Coffee’s Oakland location was
one of 88 shops across the U.S. that will be p
rebranded as Peet’s Coffee and'Tea locations.
Another 80 stores will be closed completely.
In addition to the chain’s location in Oakland,
three others in the Pittsburgh area — one each
in South Side, Brentwood and at the Water-
works Mal1— have closed and will reopen as
locations for Peet’s Coffee and Tea.

More than 610 Caribou Coffee stores in
20 states and the District of Columbia remain
open. Almost half of these locations are in
Minnesota, where the company was founded
in 1992. Although all locations in Pennsylvania
will be closed, some locations in Minnesota
and other states will remain open for now.

The Joh. A. Benckiser Group, a company
based in Germany, completed an agreement

in Minneapolis, Minn., last December. Ac-
cording to an SEC report, Joh. A. Benckiser,
which also owns the high-end fashion house
Jimmy Choo and cosmetics company Coty,
acquired the company for about $340 million.
The group also holds Peet’s from a purchase
made last October. Peet’s founder, Alfred Peet,
opened his ﬁrst store in Berkeley, Calif., in
1966. Over the past four decades, Peet’s has
expanded-to approximately 300 locations.

born out of revolution” and a “pioneer
in the idea of universal human rights.” In
abolishing slavery after declaring inde-
pendence in 1804, Haiti advanced that
idea further than the American Revolu-
tionary War did.

Haiti, a country that is now home to
almost 10 million people, was the second
nation in the Western Hemisphere to
gain its independence. In 1791, under
the command of Toussaint Louverture,

April, when the changes within the coffee
shop chain were ﬁrst publicly announced.
“While the decisions we’ve made have
beendifficultfor our team inMinneapolis, as
well as our team members across the country
and our guestsand fans everywhere, we are
working to make this transition as seamless
as possible for the Caribou community,” Tat-
tersﬁeld said. A A ' '

V Tattersﬁeld stated that Caribou’s business
strategy was revised throughout the year,‘
with analysts examining market reactions
to ﬁnd a better long-term plan. According
to Tattersﬁeld, Caribou Coffee locations that
had been “underperforming” were_converted
to Peet’s Coffee and Tea.

Representatives from Peet’s did not re-
spond to multiple requests for comment.
Samantha Proctor, a junior at Pitt, and

roughly 500,000 slaves living in Haiti
revolted against French colonial rule.
In 18 04, the year after Louverture died,
Haiti became the ﬁrst black-led post-
colonial country.‘

But Mongey said she did not think
the slaves who revolted against French
rule in Haiti did so because they were
committed to ideals of lib'erty.

“They were trying to get to their
land,” Mongey said.

working at the coffee shop this past summer
and continued working there until it closed.

She’ said that business at the shop had
been steady,’and some regulars did not wel-
come the news of the store’s closing.

“People were pretty devastated. A lot of '

the customers were heartbroken,” Proctor-
said. _ l E 1

Former employees of the Caribou Cof-
fee in Oakland have been offered jobs when
the coffee shop reopens in October: Proctor
expects to resume working at the location
when that happens.

Even though regulars were disappointed
yvith the closure, it didnft make much of a
difference to some other patrons.

peasants in remote areas as part of an
empowerment program that facilitated
meetings in which communities could
analyze the problems they faced.

Diehl said he had found out about the store

Columnist

In this age, the word “union”

carries a negative connotation. A

Once the sole bastion of the

-blue-collar worker, to which

workers looked for help to
ensure receipt of reasonable
pay, proper working condi-
tions and benefits, unions are
now better known as the bane
of capitalism: Organizations
that bully workers into joining,
bribe politicians through lob-
bying and are responsible for
corporate outsourcing. In light
of this stigma, the number of
American workers belonging
to unions is at a historic low
of 11.3 percent.

In fact, the percent of Amer-
icans belonging to unions has
been in sharp decline since the
mid 1970s due to a number of
factors — one being that more
and more states have made ef-
forts to follow the “right-to-
work” policy, which does not
require compulsory member-
ship in a union from individu-
als in certain professions.
Although Pennsylvania is not
yet among these states, several
Pennsylvania Republicans have
recently joined the push for the
state to join the right—to-work
roster.

But this may not be the best
option for everyone. UPMC em-
ployees in western Pennsylva-

nia, for instance, are seeing
“right-to—work” in a threaten-'
- ing light. V
The reason‘? Some unions in
Pennsylvania are still looking
pretty heroic, especially when
it comes to defending UPMC
workers. When allegations of
UPMC service employees being
ﬁred for attempting to union-
=ize popped up, SEIU Health-
.care Pennsylvania staged a
march on Labor Day challeng-
ing UPMC’s actions. The union
was able to regain one of two
employee’s positions by ﬁling
complaints ‘with the National

Labor Relations Board. The board states
that there is evidence that UPMC vio-

lated federal law by illegally ﬁring and

intimidating workers. -
Unsatisﬁed, the Service.Emp1oyees
International Union and many work-

ers are still protesting that wages and

beneﬁts are too low and continueto
push for the unionization of UPMC’s’
service jobs.

The health care giant disagrees with
these claims and argues that when
factoring in employee benefits, full-
time workers actually make up to $21
per hour. However, actual wages top
out at around $15 per hour and many
UPMC employees say they make barely
enough to get by —‘— and that very well
may be the case. To put these numbers
into perspective, $15 an hour equates
roughly to a gross annual income of
$31,000. But after paying federal’and
state taxes alone, employees only see

September 24,2013 I The Pitt News | vvvvvv.pittnevvs.Com

about $25,400 of that.=It’s hard to raise
a family on that income.

In theory, UPMC exists to better the
communities it serves. So why does this
nonproﬁt organization, exempt from
corporate taxation, ﬁnd itself paying
workers so little?

The answer is because UMPC doesn’t
really act like a nonproﬁt organization,
but like a corporation. That’s not to say
that UPMC hasn’t invested in th_e com-
munity — it certainly has. But other
actions the health care system has taken
suggest that UPMC is looking to make
a buck, even  it cuts people off from
resources they need.

For example, let’s take a look at the
salary of UPMC’s CEO, Jeffrey Romoff.
Mr. Romoff makes an annual salary
of close to $5.97 million. Sure, he is
the No. 1-earning CEO of a nonproﬁt
hospital, but why shouldn’t he be? He
has a h'ard job running UPMC: one of
the nation’s leading hospitals, ranked

10th best nationwide by U.S.News 8:‘

World Report. Also, UPMC is the top-
grossing nonproﬁt hospital in the coun-

‘ try, bringing in $10.19 billion this last

year — surely they can afford to pay
him that much. .

- But let’s look at how other nonproﬁt
hospital CEOs are compensated — and
realize the enormity of Romoff’s sal-
ary by comparison. No. 2 on the list
of highest-earning nonproﬁt hospital
executives is Delos Cosgrove, CEO of the

‘renowned Cleveland Clinic. He earns

$2.31 million annually ‘— less than half
of what Romoff does. In addition, the
Cleveland Clinic has an annual revenue
of $9.6 billion, not far off from UPMC,
but it is ranked higher by U.S.News 8:.
World Report as the fourth-best hospi-
tal in the nation.

Let’s also look at the CEO of Massa-
chusetts General Hospital, considered
second-best in the nation by U.S.News &
World report. He’s ranked 11th—highest
in earnings making a measly (in hospi-
tal CEO terms) $2.24 million. Somehow,
he still manages to run a world-class
hospital, despite having a smaller yearly
salary.

Startlingly, overcompensation may

even spread to the rest of UPMC’s ex-
ecutive board. “Make It Our UPMC,”
a Service Employees International
Union—sponsored project challenging
the hospital to give its service workers
better wages, claims that the hospitals’
27 executives are compensated, collec-
tively, $47.5 million a year. The project
also claims that UPMC has the third-
highest number of full-time workers
on Medicaid assistance, after Wal-Mart
and McDonald’s. This begs the question:
How long does the trickle-down take?

This massive executive compensa-
tion at UPMC exhibits how this hospital
acts like a for-—profit corporation that

'_is only nonproﬁt in name. With the

amount of ‘power UPMC wields, mak-
ing Pennsylvania a “right-to-work’.’
state would give UPMC the possibility
to force people not to join a union in
order to be employed. As long as UPMC
remains the health care monolith it’s
become, most UPMC service workers
are safer if Pennsylvania. doesn’t be-
come right-to-work. I

"Pittsburgh’s 3rd annuai zine fair showcased the variety of the city’s ine scenylan Abbot] For The Pitt News

and ENTERTAINMENT

For 3rd—straight year, Pittsburgh’s zine scene convenes

Dylan Abbott.
For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh is infested with “zinesters”
-— it’s an epidemic beyond imaginable
proportions. There is a vast community‘
of writers, comic artists, poets, design-
ers and illustrators within the city, all of
whom are self-publishing their creative
conceptions and cutting out (and pos-
sibly pasting) the corporate middle—man

to personally supply the public with .

their printed and stapled brain chil-
dren. Zines are generally small-scale,
self—published and self—produced print
works that include a mix of anything

from art to social commentary to an
appealing blend of the two. And their
propagators have laid down roots in the
city. On Sunday, this proliferation was
on display at the Pittsburgh Zine Fair.
Held at Union Project in Highland Park,
the fair brought together some of most
exciting local and national zine pro-
ducers. Founded in 2011 by a group of
Pittsburgh’s artists and cartoonists who
saw a need for a platform they and their
creative peers could use to showcase
their work, the event has evolved into a
haven for the city’s artistic and literary
talents, while simultaneously providing
the local community a chance to interact

with this reinvigorated art scene.

Maggie Negrete, creator of the zine
“Adventuring Princesses” and co-orga-
nizer of the Pittsburgh Zine Fair, out-
lined the recent proliferation of zine
production within Pitts'burgh, saying
“the zine is the easiest format to make
what you want to make and start putting
it in people’s hands.”

Within the spacious Union Project’s
main hall, backlit by stain-glass-tinged
sunlight, the event was awash with com-
munal spirit. Artists and writers were
indistinguishable from the crowds of
curious attendees as they similarly cir-
culated the room, taking note of what

their counterparts had produced. Nate
McDonough, comic artist and resident
of Pittsburgh, explained that not only is
it a great event for like-minded artists
and writers to form collaborations and
to strengthen the creative network with-
in the city, but it also provides ample op-
portunity to “find new people who don’t
know about this kind of stuf .” Nate,

- continues to endorse the zine culture

by expressing that it is a “humble” me-
dium, due to its do-it—yourself qualities,
and wholly inclusive for both creators
and consumers.

CONCERT ‘ RE.VlEW

September 24, 2013 | The Pitt News | \AA/wx/.pittnevvs.com ,

The xx maintains intimate sound,
passion in spacious Stage AE

Brett Sholtis
Staff Wrz'ter

During their performance at Stage AE

on Saturday night, The xx proved that .

sometimes real emotion comes not as
a scream, but as a murmur.

By now, anyone who cares about mu—.

sic is familiar with The xx,‘ the Mercury-
Prize—winning trio from London whose
sophomorerelease, Coexist, hit No. 1 on
the British charts last year. With hushed,
co-ed_ vocals and plenty of negative
space between beats, The xx’s studio

albums are as intimate and impassioned ‘ ‘ .

as the dialogue between lovers.
Although this makes for the perfect
soundtrack to a chill evening at home,
how would such low—key music translate
at Stage AE’s indoor, 18-and—up venue
packed nearly to capacity with noisy
Pittsburghers? The xx, or perhaps their

production team, seemed to have an

easy solution for this: turn everything
up. , C
Clad in black, with Romy Madley
Croft and Oliver Sim both Swearing

long-sleeved button-downs that had the '

elbows inexplicably cut out, the band

gave no introduction before launch- .

ing into its set. From the first songs of
the performance, they showed confi-
dence with themselves, the crowd and

the material. Sim swayed with his bass .

as he played, and Croft and Sim often
came togetherito sing into the same
mic, while Jamie Smith, a.k.a. Jamie
xx, ran the beats by playing a hybrid
of “real” and synthesized percussion.
Smith aptly riffed on the band’s most
popular songs, and on “Reunion” he
achieved the unlikely feat of making a

_ synthesized steel drum sound ethereal

and even kind of sexy. Indie hits such
as “VCR” and “Fiction,” far from los-
ing their punch live, became anthems

of mass catharsis, as the surprisingly

age—diverse crowd clapped along with
the beat and sang the choruses.
“Angels” was particularly good, due
largely to Croft’s delivery being dead
on. As she sang the refrain, “_They would

The xx made up for a iack of banter with a laser show. Photo courtesy of Russ Smith

be as in love with you as I am,” half the
crowd was hanging on her every syl-
lable, while the other half of the crowd
was singing along.

To be sure, this concert may have

been a bit impersonal for those whose
idea of a live show involves banter, sto-
rytelling or proselytizing. For me, the
lack of conversation was no surprise,
given the band’s rather reclusive perso-
na. When they did speak, it was mostly
to thank the crowd, a gesture that came
off the same way as their song lyrics do:
honest and heartfelt. ‘

Even though there was no banter,
The xx does travel with one of the best
laser shows around, which along with

' the singing crowd made for a surpris-

ingly friendly experience. With the vo-

T cals ampliﬁed such that every click was

audible, Croft and Sim’s voices weren’t
so much in my ears as they were inside
my head. And like The xx’s music, their
laser show was restrained and tasteful
— which is paradoxical since, you know,
it’s a laser show. i

The xx, in their matchinggarb and

echoed styles, may appear about as
united as a military unit, but I would
look for Croft to break out on her own -
that’s my prediction. By the end of the
night, she was beginning to stray from
the script a bit, both melodically and
emotionally, singing higher in her reg-
ister and in a style that was less Air and
more Haim. Maybe it wasjust a ﬂeeting
thing or perhaps it’s a new phase in their
evolution, but from a young ‘band that
has already shown such total belief in
themselves, it’s likely to be exciting.

Pitt cookbook
reflects shift
in localfood

culture

Grace Kelly
Staff Wrz'ter

1 Cookbooks from the past have a special

quality. They show not only obvious differ-
ences in culture in general, but more speciﬁ-
cally the differences in food culture. While
scanning the shelves of myfavorite part of

' the library, the. cookbook section (yes, I

am an unabashed cookbook reader), a slim
spine titled “Pitt Golden Panther Cookbook”
by Marilyn Ross caught my attention.

The “Pitt Golden Panther Cookbook”
reﬂects a time at Pitt when Dan Marino was

. a name still ﬂoating around college sports,

when Wesley Posvar was a chancellor rather
than just the name of a building and when
high—waisted jeans ﬁrst came into vogue. It
also reﬂects a different food era, a time when
mushroom soup was a staple ingredient for
many recipes and when preservatives were
seen as a good thing. The 1981 cookbook
combines this retrospective view of Pitt as
a University, as well as Pitt as an institution,
that had its own unique food culture.

Marilyn Ross, the director of Intramu-
rals and Athletics here at Pitt, was respon-
sible for the creation of this cookbook 32
years ago, copies of which were sold to
raise funds for athletic scholarships. The
Pitt Golden Panther Club (now the Panther
Club) is a group at Pitt that is “committed
to providing Pitt student-athletes with the
opportunity to excel in three areas (success
in_the classroom, on the ﬁelds of competi-
tion and in the community).  The Panther
Club serves as the ofﬁcial ﬁindraising unit
for Pitt Athletics.”

The fact that a cookbook was commis-
sioned to raise funds speaks of a different
concept of fundraising, as well as food
culture, in that era. Today we might raise
money by holding a banquet for which one

5106 Penn Ave, Garﬁeld

8 p.m. '2

Admission: $8

One of the best bands to come out of the
terriﬁc New Brunswick basement scene in

recent years, Screaming Females is a classic
guitar—bass-drum trio with a deﬁnitive punk
bent. That beingsaid, the band’s idiosyncratic
style and frontlady Marissa Patemoster’s abil-
ity to vacillate between warbling verse and
fearsome screams ensures that you won’t
confuse a Screaming Females show with any
other punk show you’ve ever been to. Stand-
ing at about 5 feet tall, Patemoster’s ability
to absolutely shred on guitar and her intense
delivery is no gimmick — she’s a singular
talent in music.

tain’s sting operation working its way through
a gun syndicate features plenty of volatility,
tension and — of course — the explosive
gunplay that action junkies are all about. With
some critics billing this the crime ﬁlm of the

on an air of sophistication as they get their

“Our Town”

Pittsburgh Public Theater

Admission: $15.75 with Student ID,

“Our Town” is playwright T. Thornton
Wilder’s classic three—act tale of a small town
in early 20th-century America. Perhaps most
impressively, the metatheatrical style of the

piece doesn’t detract from the depth of char— 1

acterization. Instead, the two complement
each other, creating a play that deﬁed the
conventions of its day without posing as a
piece of high art. With local theater icon Tom
Atkins taking the role of “Stage Manager” (a
character in the play), Pittsburgh Public The-
ater’s performance promises to capture the
spirit that makes this piece timeless despite
its vintage setting. .

COOKBOOK

buys tickets to attend or an auction of a
meal prepared by a celebrity chef. The shift
doesn’t stop at just fundraising, though.
Nearly every aspect of the foodwe eat has
become more worldly and complex. Today’s
food-appreciation culture —— promoted
by celebrity chefs, magazines and other
media — has taught us that even humble ra-
men can become ramen that is loaded with
miso, hard-boiled egg, kimchi and a dash of
Sriracha-. Think of it as “globalized food.”
In 1980s Pittsburgh, food was your
'grandmother’s recipe for sweet rolls, green-
bean casserole and Pennsylvania pecan pie.
The dishes from the Pitt Golden Panther
Cookbook come from a time when food was
derived from humble roots, from taking
what one had and creating something that

W was ﬁlling and tasted good. Recipes such

as “Panther Potatoes,” “Post—Pitt Cream

of Mushroom Soup” and “Go—Pitt Sugar 

Cookies” reﬂect this, with their University-
homage names and array of accessible,
affordable ingredients (i.e. Heinz ketchup
and Hellmann’s mayo, which seem to be
present in every recipe). But although these
recipes may be seen as humble, economy-
driven dishes and a seemingly complete
departure from our present-day, global-
ized, foodie—culture food, there are some
similarities. M

The new cream of mushroom soup of
today’s era is a college—student staple, ra-
men noodles. The means may bedifferent,
but they represent the same means. While
we may no longer have marzaschino cherry-
studded ham loaf or an array ofjell-0 salads
at family gatherings, these recipes trans-
port us back to a time at Pitt that, despite
being quite different, maintains a thread
of familiarity — of University pride and
of affordable, ﬁlling and tasty food. Ross
notes, “As with all things, we have moved
on  but we (still) have the same spirit.”

ZINE

Another explanation for the zine’s re-
cent surge in popularity is the freedom
this medium provides. The array of

genres and styles and means of com— ‘_
munication exhibited at the fair is stag- -

gering, varying from vampire erotica
novels to feminist linoleum prints to
irreverent comics concerning a young
daughter distressed by her father’s
use of the word “swag.” There actu-

ally is something for everybody. Laura "

Warman’s zine, titled “Warman Writes
About Sex,” a personal and candid ex-
ploration into the subject of fornication,‘
exempliﬁes the malleability of the me-

dium. But her transition from blogger .
V to “zinester” wasn’t necessarily due to

a lack of constraints. Instead, it was
catalyzed by a desire for more direct
contact with her readership: “_I used
to blog a lot of my work, but it always
seemed kind of depressing to hit sub-

. mit and have it ﬂoating around on the

Internet.  It’s much more tactile, and
it_ feels more‘ real,” Warman said.

' Andy Scott, advertising director for
the Pittsburgh Zine Fair and foimder
of Little Tired Press, echoed similar
sentiments, explaining, “zines and in-
dependent literature is'a great way to
publish as you’re working  to show
your development [and] get immediate

._ feedback.” As a co-founder of the fair,

Andy also asserted the importance of
the community’s involvement with a

venture such as this, and that involve— .

ment has thus far been achieved through
partnerships with “organizations with
the same ethos” such as the Carnegie
Library and The Mr. Roboto Project, a
DIY venue and show space in Pittsburgh.

The Pittsburgh Zine Fair was evi-
dently much more than just a contact
zone for the public and the city’s up-

‘and—coming artists and writers, who

are often left to dwell unappreciated
and undiscovered until fortune shines
kindly on them. In fact, although still

‘in its infancy, The Pittsburgh Zine
Fair is at the heart of an imperative, ,

community-based creative culture —
championing the “zine” as the ideal
mediumfor immediate connection and
self—expression. I

In week three of the NFL season, for‘-

numbers, and one alumnus in particu-
lar took the opportunity to distance
himself from the rest of the league. .
LeSean McCoy (Pitt 2002-2003)
took a commanding leadin the early
race for the NFL rushing title. His 158

brought his season total to 395 yards,

Although McCoy was able to once

McCoy looks to add to his league-

 Chryst looks for improvement as Pitt

prepares to play Virginia Saturday 1

Head coach Paul Chryst says Pitt needs tov‘cIean up’ a few things inipractice this week. Sheldon Satenstein_| Assistantvisual Editor

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football notched a 58-55 victory
over the Duke Blue Devils Saturday,
but it was a game that should’vé been
no contest, as the Panthers led by 20
points "in the first half and 17 with 8:30
remaining in the fourth quarter.

Head coach Paul Chryst placed the
onus for the inability to close out the
Blue Devils on the offense when he ad-
dressed the media Monday.

“‘We’ve got stuff We’re building on,”
Chryst said. “A good offense finishes
that game —— period. We’re showing
signs of it at times.” _

This Saturday, Pitt (2-1, 1-1 ACC)
matches up with the Virginia Cavaliers
(2-1, 0-0 ACC) in the Cava1iers’s ﬁrst
conference game. To earn a victory on

Homecoming weekend, Pitt needs to
improve — especially on defense.

“-I think they’re a good team, ob-
viously you respect your opponent,”
Chryst said. “We’ve gotta be better, I
think, if we want to win Saturday.”_

Saturday’s game marks the third-
straight week Pitt will play, after a bye
in week two, and Chryst said, “it feels

good to be in the rhythm of a season,” _

as the Panthers prepare for their week-
four opponent. ’
Chryst said he’s impressed with what

’ he’s seen from Virginia'—- particularly

onthe front seven. .

“First impressions: They look to be
very athletic. They’ve got some good
size offensively, defensively,” Chryst
said. “I think they’re a good-looking
team. They’ve played some different

types of games.”

Those games for Virginia include
a 59-10 blowout at the hands of No. 2
Oregon as well as a 19-16 victory over
Brigham Young University that Chryst
called “hard-fought.” '

“Defensively, shoot, they’ve been
great on third down,” Chryst said.
“They had a bye week, then got going
again — seemed like they got the run-
ning game going.”

Alongside the running game, Vir-
ginia’s passing has begun to pick up its
end of the bargain behind quarterback
David Watford. Watford posted his best
effort of the year so far last week against
Virginia Military Institute as he.com-
pleted 18 of 25 passes for 206 yards and
two touchdowns.

Savage, Street, Boyd and Conner earn national S
recognition following Pitt’s 55-point outburst    

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt’s offensive explosion Saturday in a
58-55 victory at Wallace Wade Stadium
against the Duke Blue Devils led to mul-
tiple Panthers earning weekly honors
from severalorganizations. -
Redshirt senior quarterback Tom
Savage ﬁnished Saturday’s game having
completed 23 of 33 passes for 424 yards
and six touchdowns. Asa result, Savage
was named the Davey O’Brien National
Quarterback of the Week, the Walter

Camp Football Foundation’s National

Offensive Player of the Week and the
ACC Offensive Back of the Week.

“I thought he made good decisions.
I thought he had some poise,” head
coach Paul Chryst said. “I like the way
he played.”

Savage’s performance accounted for
the fourth-best single-game yardage
total by a Pitt quarterback in school
history and ‘marked the most yards
thrown in a game since 1994. Savage’s

‘six touchdowns were the most thrown

by a Panthers signal—caller since Pete
Gonzalez tossed seven against Rutgers
in 1997. ‘

In addition, the six scores thrown by
Savage tied the Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence’s single-game record, set in 1987.

the fourth garnered by a Panther since
2004, following quarterback Tyler
Palko (2004), linebacker Scott McKill0p
(2008) and running back Ray Graham
(2011). '

Other candidates for the Davey
O’Brien honors included Clemson’s Tajh
Boyd and Texas A'&M’s Johnny Manziel.

The ACC also named redshirt senior
receiver Devin Street as the conference’s

Receiver of the Week and freshman re— I

ceiver Tyler Boyd as the Rookie of the
Week.
Street set a personal single-game re-

cord Saturday with 166 receiving yards . S

on six catches for an average of 27.6
yards per catch. Street also hauled in
two touchdowns from 67 and 21 yards
out. . ‘
Opposite Street, Boyd racked up 154
yards and -three touchdowns over eight
receptions. The three touchdowns for
Boyd were the first time a Pitt freshman
caught three scoring passes in a game
since Larry Fitzgerald accomplished
the feat against Virginia Tech in 2002.
Boyd also posted his second con-
secutive 100—yard receiving game and
became the first freshman to do so since

Antonio Bryant in 1999. Both Fitzgerald - 

and Bryant won the Biletnikoff Award
in their sophomore seasons. Boyd now

Boyd was also named the National
Freshman of the Week by 247 Sports for
the second week in a row and"was the
co—honoree along with Pittfreshman
running back James Conner via Athlo.n
Sports.

Conner turned in his "best perfor-
mance of the season to date, running for
173 yards ‘on 26 carries. Conneraveraged
6.7 yards per carry, scored a touchdown
and was not _stopped_;behind the. line of
scrimmage on any attempt. C" ' 

.“I thought he ran pretty well and
earned the right for more , carries,”
Chryst said. “We had the one drive where
he had three back—to-back good runs.”

dropped the game, 31-7.

Next week provides an exciting
matchup for Panthers fans: Fitzgerald
and the Cardinals will head to Tampa
Bay to take on Revis and the Buccaneers.
Revis, who usually shadows the oppo-
nent’s best wide receiver, wants to_ give
Fitzgerald a difficult time next Sunday
afternoon. In turn, Fitzgerald isstill
in search of his first V100-yard game in
2013. ' ' V

Cleveland defensive end Jabaal
Sheard (Pitt 2007-2010) was the lone
former Panther to ﬁnd victory in week

three. He had three tackles, a sack and

a fumble recovery in a 31-27 upset over
Minnesota. , .

San Francisco punter Andy Lee
(Pitt 2000-2004) continues to see an
increase in work due to a struggling
49ers offense. Lee launched seven punts
— including two that landed inside the
20-yard line and another that he nailed
for 62 yards. %

talented,” Chryst said. “He’s an easy
thrower. You can tell that he’s got an
arm, and obviously when you do see him
running, he looks dangerous.”
Although Chryst talked about the
need to improve this week, there was a
bright side to Pitt’s victory over Duke.
“I’m certainly appreciative of what
the guys did Saturday,” Chryst said. “A

lot of ebbsland flows to that game, but

i we talked about going down and playing

60 minutes, and we used all 60, but we
were able to win.”

As cliche as it sounds, the win'for
Chryst was truly a team effort.

“I think that when we look at the
film, every group contributed to that
win,” Chryst said. ’ *

_ Pitt received scoring from many dif-
ferent sources, including From Tom
Savage’s 424 passing ya_rds,]ames Con-
ner’s 173 rushing yards and Anthony

Gonzalez’s interception returned for a
touchdown. That’s not to mention the
performances of rece-ivers Devin Street
and Tyler Boyd, who combined for over
300 of Savage’s passing yards.

But on the other hand, the defense
still allowed 55 points, which came as
a byproduct of a number of big plays
executed by the Blue Devils. —

“It was a game of big plays, and we’ve
gotta do a betterjob on special teams
and defensively on not giving up those
big plays,” Chryst said. “When you have‘

a chance to get ‘em on offense, you’ve
gotta be able to capitalize.”

Duke’s big plays, in Chryst’s eyes,
were a result of Panthers not staying
tuned in to their individual assign-
ments.

“A couple of the big plays came by
where guys see a void in the defense,
and he tries to overcome that,” Chryst
said. “Then in return, he gets beat be-
cause he’s not doing his job.”

Another major problem was a lack of
execution on Pitt’s behalf in the tackling
department, but there were also some
redeeming plays from the defense such
as the four turnovers Pitt _forced.

“You don’t feel good about giving up
that many points,” Chryst said. “But we
don’t win that game without some of
those plays. The first two drives started
with interception, interception.”

_ As Pitt goes through its preparation
for the Cavaliers, the proper adjust-
ments start at the top. '

“There’s things we’ve gotta clean
up, starting with me,” Chryst said. “It
starts with coaching, and then players
gotta go do it.” I
