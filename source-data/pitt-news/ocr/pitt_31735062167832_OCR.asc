"Media Menagerie”

by BOB BONN
Staff Writer

One of the more theoretical and abstract subjects covered by Wed-
nesday‘s FAS Convocation dealt with "Educational Innovations: Mad-
ness and Methods." Held at 3:30 p.m. in 121 CF. the discussion on multi-
media presentations of factual material was chaired by Robert Mar-
shallof the English Department. ‘

_Ryland Crary of the School of Education began the discussion by
saying that "innovation should not be mistaken to mean a press for any-
thing new in education. Crary said that it is. in fact. the rediscovery of
progressive education. education with regard for the person.

A star performer on the panel was Dr. Stanley Shostak of the Bio-
logy Department. Shostak showed the audience one of his films. a
bright, unintelligible sort of film with a lot of moving lines and piano
music playing in the background. While this strange menagerie of light
and sound was flickering on the screen. Shostak explained in a slow.
soft voice just what was to be accomplished by the use of multi-media.

According to Shostak, the purpose of the University is to make stu-
dents “aware that they are human beings . ._ . turning them on to what
they are and to what's around them. How? Go to where the kids are.”

This particular method of "going to where the kids are" seems
to be effective for Shostak. since serveral of his former students who
were in the audience noted that they had done exceptionally well on
biology achievement tests after having taken his class.

A general change in the direction of the discussion occurred when

Dr. Omar K. Moore. head of the Learning Research Development Cen- .

ter (LRDC ). and Dr. William Cooley. also of LRDC. discussed the class-
room of the future. According to Moore. the "new technology" is mak-
ing rapid steps in replacing the large lecture hall on the college cam-
pus. Moore said that it would soon be unnecessary to assemble large
groups of people for the purpose of education. “Learning cubicles"
could do the job much more efficiently and could also employ the mult-
media concept. .

Other members of the panel and also many in the audience reacted
rather strongly to Moore’s assertation. One student declared that “the
thought of having computer terminals in all houses for kids to learn is
absolutely shocking.” Shostak added that “maybe there’ll always be a
place (for education as well as a place for training and education means
people and with people.”

Moore explained that a more technological approach to education
does not necessarily mean sitting in front of a console with a machine.
He emphasized that. although machines may play a major role in to-
morrow s education. there will be room for groups of co—learners.

The cost of using innovative techniques was discussed by Vice-
Chancellor Edison Montgomery as the discussion drew to a close. and
Education Counselor Mark Peterson proposed that the University de-
velop a multi-media teaching center.

Election Day Nears

News Editor

In the University's Commons
Room. Towers Lobby. Engineer-
ing and Scaife Halls students have
been presenting their validated ID
cards all day today. to vote in a

_ major concern of the University:

Student Government elections.

Until Tuesday of this week cam-
paigning for the position had been
carried out by three different par-
ties. the Student Community Un-
ion <SCUl. headed by Harris
Miller. the United Students
Coalition. (USC). lead by Steve
Cundra and Mike Fravicants

ger.because of similar programs
and related goals between Miller
and Fabricant the student‘s choice
has been limited to either the
SCU party or USC.

According to Fabricant the mer-

 ger has been formulated to a gen-

eral point where Miller's party is
supporting most of the ideas and

 

concepts of the START party
while that party fully endorses
Miller's candidacy. and slate of
the required senators.

There has been debates, cam-
paigning, question and answer
sessions, and many ideas present-
ed for varying degrees of change
on all sides.

Miller sees the major problem
on campus today as the lack of
student "personal identity and
along with a new Student Govern-
ment Constitution emphasizes that
it is time that we put our concern
where it belongs—-on people."

Cundra, feels that "our main

prime concerns of the session at

So now the decision is being
made by the students of the Uni-
versity. All sides have pointed out
that there is something wrong
with Student Government on this
campus and that it must undergo

‘some type of positive change.

Their ways of going about this
change are, of course, different,
but they do recognize that one
word: change.

taining the present requirement.
It is her reasoning that new stu-
dents do not always recognize the
value of taking a foreign language
andthat they therefore need a

-. guide. She concluded that it is

"creative innovation" and not

abolition that is needed.

Dr. Sargent was followed by
Scott Baum. president of Student
Government. who favored the
abolition of the requirement.
while stressing the importance of
a language. He objected to the re-
quirement on” the grounds that it
tended to create a distaste for a
language on the part of the student
who is being forced to participate.

Baum noted that it might be more
constructive to learn the aspects
of a foreignpculture. He also
charged that the student is a
grown person and that, as an
adult, he should be permitted to
make his own decisions.

A discussion followed. with a
sizable portion of the audience par-
ticipating. Included in their com-
ments were the questionable ma-
turity of the student. the quality
of the instruction involved. and
the usefulness of the requirement
as it now stands.

The session ended with Dr.
Anthony's comments on the al-
ternatives to the requirement.
Favoring abolition. he proposed
that a new organization outside
the departments be set up in order
to revolutionize the present struc-

.ture and stressed becoming pro-

ficient in a language at the rate
of the individual student. He con-
cluded that his idea of restruct-
uring would include language
labs. courses in both the common
and the uncommon language, the
teaching of English as a foreign

- language. and instruction in the
different dialects of the English

language.

Combats Inequalities

women are too often forced into
the characteristic mold of house-
wife and mother. The co-chairmen
of the Pittsburgh Womens’ Lib-
eration accused universities of

perpetrating the myth that wom-. '

en are fit for nothing else.

"College." she explained." is
too often viewed as only an inter-
im period for women. We are ex-
pected to get married and have
children instead of entering the
work force. And women who do
work are generally paid less than
men with jobs of the same na-
ture."

Miss Hornstein also related
that she had “gotten the run
around” in trying to initiate’ pro-
grams fostering women’s libera-
tion here at the University.

Also discussing the plight of
women in the labor force. Dr. Sal:
per termed them “exploitable
surplus labor." '

"Working women must not only
compete with men,“ lamented the
assistant dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences." but they must
also compete among themselves."

I/)r. Salper also spoke of the par-
ticularly distressing situation of
black women caught in the “dou-

ble jaws of race and sex.” . . L

Miss Heide. the Pennsylvania

convener for a womens‘ rights.

group known as "NOW," com-
plained of the ghetto in which
working women usually find them-
selves trapped. She believes that

"the only job in the world for,
which women are not qualified is

sperm-donor. "

The staunch womens‘ rights ad-
vocate revealed that “NOW” has
filed charges against the Pitts-
burgh Press for alleged discrim-
ination in its advertising practices.

A question that arose in the
minds of many of those present
was that if the women were out
working, who would raise the chil-.
dren. Miss Whitman stated that
the roles of mother ‘and earner
are not necessarily mutually ex-
clusive. Pointing to her success-
ful careers as both, the associate
professor of economics noted that
“the actual conflict is not asgreat
as it's said to be.”

Miss Whitman further cited re-
cent experiments with state nurs-
eries. Miss Whitman_n0ted that
"children raised in these nurs-
eries are neither better nor worse
than other children.”

Dealing more with the psycho-
logical aspects of discrimination,
Miss Frye placed some of the re-
sponsibility on parents. '

“Parents often over indulge
failure in females,” reasoned the
assistant professor of philosophy.
Girls, consequently, have low ex-
pectations of themselves.”

Sharing some of her classroom
experiences, Miss Frye bemoan-
ed the (act that most girls have no
desire to learn or participate,

since no one, including themselves, .

expects it of them.

Ogul Examines Nixon, Polls

STEVE LUBETSKY
Staff Writer
The opening session of La
Cosa Nostra, the newly assem-
bled political science club, was
held in 501 SU Tuesday after-
noon, at which time Dr. Morris

A .Ogul examined the impact of

public opinion on the Nixon Ad-

 ministration.

..Ogul, who teaches a seminar
in political science, observed

that an overwhelming majority

expresses approval of President
Nixon, as a politician, and as a
man as well. This support he at-
tributed to several factors.

“Most people react favorably to
almost anything, within a cer-
tain range, as long as there is
positive action," pointed out Dr.
Ogul. He mentioned how Nixon
has handled the Viet Nam War.
or crime in the streets. which
people are satisfied‘ with. The
issues at stake are not of con-
cern for most people—just as

long as someone does some-
thing.”
According to Ogul the pres-

. ,ti»ge which accompanies the Pre-

sidency is also an asset to Nix-
on’s current popularity. He
pointed out that. for the last
twenty years. the most admired

How can one change Adminis-
tration policies. was one of the
questions Dr. Ogul answered by
r_e-emphasizing the impact of
public opinion. "One person can-
not act at random. simply be-
cause he opposes the Presidents
policy—making and hope that
Nixon will pay him attention."
he affirmed. “Only public op-
inion can hope to accomplish
that."

Dr. Ogul concluded by turn-
ing to the Administrations maj-
or weakness, which he ascer-
tained was Congress. “As long
as we apply pressure by writ-
ing letters to our representa-
tives, Congressmen will reject
Mr. Nixon’s proposals and force
him to make alterations.“

Moratorium

Plans Future Programs 4»

B0B GING
Staff Writer

The National Moratorium
Committee is again planning
new programs relating to the
peace movement and the cessa-
tion of the war in Vietnam.
During the last week. Larr_v
Kudlow. a member of the Na-
tional Committee was in Pitts-
burgh. and as a result of his vis-
it. it was announced that the
Moratorium Committee is set-
ting up a full-time office in this
city. The office should have one
full-time employee. and several
volunteers.

Bob Mogart. a member of the
local Moratorium Committee ex-
plained some of the commit-
tee's plans for the coming
months. He said that rather than
concentrating on mass marches
and memorial ceremonies. (such
as the Christmas Eve memorial
at Heinz Chapel. where over
three thousand people attended.)
the Moratorium is turning its ef-
forts to a program of local con-
sciousness.a

Mogart explained that at pre-
sent. the Moratorium. and other
similar groups. are working with
the Welfare Rights Organization

P"¢9eIFIh‘

Action Committee in attempt to
set up a lunch program for im-
poverished youngsters in the
Pittsburgh area.

He cited the fact that while
our government spends as much

as $8.000 on one bomb. many

children are going hungry all
over the country. “It is not sel-
fish to want a better life for
people." Mogart said. "and peace
is this search for a better life."
The reason the Moratorium is
turning to local activities such as
the lunch program. is that there
is a feeling that the priority of
the distribution of government
funds is misdirected. He said
that more tax money. which ori-
ginates in the city of Pittsburgh.
is spent on the war in Vietnam
than on welfare. and other pov-
erty directed programs.

By becoming involved in com-
munity problems. Mogart feels
that the Moratorium will show
that it is» "going beyond the

‘elan of the demonstration and

 

bringing about a consciousness of
the way things really are."

He continued that. "Besides
the lunch program. the Mora-
torium is going to be sponsoring
a series of concerts by perform-
ers sympathetic to the peace
movement. among whom are
Jimi Hendrix. Blood. Sweat and
Tears. Taj Mahal and others. Also
being considered is a drive ask-
ing workers. students and others
to give up eating lunch for one
week. and contribute the money
they save to the lunch program.

Mogart explained that the ra-
tionale behind this drive is to
have people feel for one week
what so many kinds in America
feel every day. hunger.

The Moratorium Committee.

which meets at 8:00 P.M. every
Tuesday. at the American

G

' Friends Meeting House. will an-

nounce other projects concerning
the peace movement in the fu-
ture. one which may be a mass
march on Washington this spring.-

port of the President. The doc-
tor said that the Administra-
tion would have quieted Agnew
if his remarks had been damag-
ing, and that Agnew has given
the ‘silent-majority‘ a "frame-
work for observing the left." Dr.
Ogul referred to the speech de-
livered by Nixon last Novem-
ber. where the President men-
tioned the "hard-working silent

sible peace demonstrators. who
. have nothing better to do."

Dr. Ogul asserted that people
are basically ignorant of the
real facts. but they respond to

» the emotional tone of Vice-Presi-

dent Agnew‘s voice.

A fourth reason why the Pre-

- sident’s ratings have been so im-

pressive is due to the "pragma-
as Dr. Ogul term-
ed it, of the Chief Executive in
determing policy. which he ex-
plained means; whatever the

_ President does is under the in-

fluence of public opinion polls.

For this reason. according to
Ogul, the Administration sup-
ported the appointment of Clem-
ent Hainsworth to the Supreme
Court, even when defeat was in-
evitable. “By his actions. Nixon
convinced the South that he is
a true friend. and. consequently.
enhanced his popularity in
southern states."

More than 300 city public school
students jammed a meeting of the
Pittsburgh Board of Education in
Oakland to protest "denial of the
right to free speech.“

The students. who called them-
selves Students for Better Schools
and who came mostly from Tay-
lor—Allderdice High School. de-
manded Tuesday that the board
let them invite speakers of their
choice to school assemblies.

Students from the University.
including former Taylor—Allder-

dice student Gary Goldberg, also ‘

partook in the protest. Goldberg
told school director Richard F.
Jones:

“The fact that you are a mem-
ber of the school board indicates
that you have a mandate to pro-
vide a service to the students—to
provide the best education possi-
ble.

“And part of this education
comes from these assemblies in
which speakers frequently appear.
The assemblies are learning ex-
periences.

“By denying the students their
right to invite speakers of their
choice to these assemblies. you
are, in fact, rejecting that man-
date.”

Jones had told the students that
the board’s policies were not in
violation of the constitutuional
rightto free speech. The board

member said that the board is
aware of its duties both to the
schools and to the students.

The Students for Better Schools
said they are giving the board two
weeks to meet their demands.
otherwise a general student strike
would be called Feb. 4.

in a flyer entitled. "RESIST il-
legitimate authority." the stu-
dents demanded:

“Any issue which the majority
of students (determined by home-
room vote) thinks is important
will be dealt with in voluntary as-
semblies during school hours.

“All minority voters mayhave
assemblies after school hours.

“Any person asked to speak to
a class, approved by the teacher
of that course. will be permitted
to speak."

The students said previous de-
mands had been ignored and they
charged that they had been shunt-
ed between principals and admin-
istrators in their search for school

During the debate between stu-
dents and board members. two

motions to end the discussion by
adjourning the meeting were de-

Jones told the demonstrators
he resented the fact that students
wanted board members to make a
decision by a certain deadline.

   

Board President Dr. Robert J.
Kibbee added, “We cannot be put
up against a time limit.”

  Why Liberal

 Education Gets
    Bastardized

Editor, The Pitt News:
Most of the departments in

3‘ this university. have begun to

realize that there is a new wave

 sweeping the educational com-

munity. Students are now being
exposed -to self-evaluation cours-

,  es, S-U options. reduced lang-
uage and physical education re-

quirements, and many other
forms of new thinking in course

” - andgrade structures.

There is, however, one depart-
ment that has not allowed itself
to .be moved by this change.
This department has stuck to its
guns in maintaining the most
conservative policy possible to-
wards its students. This depart-
ment is the one labeled Astron-
omy. A

I enrolled in the course As-

? 'tronomy_ 12, The Universe. When

I did, I was counseled by many
of my friends that this was to be

e a very tough and boring class.

When I attended my first class.
I found that Astronomy 12 cer-
tainly‘ did not live down to any
expectations.

The lecturer that presented the
course was interesting. even vi-
brant. The course. I found. was
being taught from a level that
seems ultimately pertinent to to-
day and the outlook for tomor-

‘V row. The’ structure of the course
was aimed at investigating the

possibility of- intelligent life in
the universe. This topic is one
that almost every thinking human
has pondered at some time in his
life. and with the realization of
all the latest space shots it be-
comes more pertinent than ever.

5 I also found that this lecturer

had made the course blanket A.

The response to this lecturer
and» his material was astound-
ing._ According to the official
roster, the class was originally
registered for 160 people. This
number has grown to the point
that the entire capacity of room
G024 CL is used, even overflow-

.  ing. In all the classes I have at-

 tended thus far, there have been
g, L, , no more than three vacant‘, seats
- l,;~i9nL.the’---rooms which has a capa-

  

   ’""""'"""""'"l""""""""""""""""""'""‘ H0 M) 0 ll

city of almost 200. In fact. in
the latest class. not only were
there no vacancies. there were
some people“ standing in the
aisle.

All this seems quite fine. and
ome may question at this point
exactly why I made the state-
ments that I made at the begin-
ning of this letter. According to
the statements made at the sec-
ond class. the department of As-
tronomy kicked up quite a fuss
about that method of grading and
the type of material presented in
the course, The department almost
literally" threatened to cut off
the stipend of the lecturer for
allowing "children" to get away
with anything so radical as a
complete A.

Also the department felt that
the method of presenting the
course was too speculative.
What this means to me is that
they feel that the course may
not be boring enough if this
material is added. They neglect
to understand that it is exactly
this topic that is so exciting to
the laymen; this is the thing that
time will prove to be the most
important phase of astronomy.
This is the thing for which much
money is being spent to investi-

gate. where giant radio tele-

scopes scan the skies in search
of some response to the question
that has tried man for thousands
of years. namely. "Are we
alone?"

..As a human being who for
many years has been interested

in the stars and the heavens. who

has followed the reports of as-

have the effect of bastardizing

CONVOCATION

Wednesdays Convocation had many construc-
tive and many destructive points. An attempt was
made at dialoge between students and faculty. and
because both factions find it very difficult to discuss
problems outside of the usual structure of the class-
room. where the teacher stands in the front and
talks down to the students and students respond by
asking questions to which they aren't assured a
clear answer. the dialogue wasn‘t as effective as
many had hoped it would be. i

As far as the attendance was concerned. many
flet it was excellent and most felt it was mostly the
same old concerned faces on both sides (students
and faculty)

Hopefully. the convocation will become a regu-
lar part of the agenda. at least monthly. and schools
such as Engineering and Medicine will take part
along with the College and the School of Education.

Having more frequent convocations will help
those who organize them remember the strong. as
well as the weak. points and each one should be an
improvement of the last. ' .

It is also hoped that the Chancellor will attend
the future convocations. His absence not only allows
people such as William Rea. chairman of the Board
of Trustees. to walk around without talking to fac-
ulty or students. but also lends an air of nonchalance
on the part of the administration.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS
Although the Pitt News refrained from its usual
procedure of endorsing a presidential candidate in
the Student Government elections this year because
so many of the staff are involved directly with one
party or another. We. the staff. can urge anyone who

day‘s edition. the senior START party united with

be two parties on the ballot. The other is the United
Student Coalition.

NOTES AND QUOTES

It was very interesting to me (as you can see
from some of the letters below». that different seg-
ments of the student body reacted in different man-
ners to the letter I wrote in Monday's issue to Abbie
Hoffman. Although I found Abbie very amusing in
his talk here last week". I questioned many of his
ideas in my letter. It seems. however. that the con-
servative element on campus felt I agreed with all
the things he said. while the more liberal element
felt I disagreed with him. It is very interesting to
note that everyone seems to read what they want to
into an article whose main purpose was to express
my mixed emotions about Abbie‘s ideology.

* =0! all *

Without a doubt. the most interesting quote Ive
seen recently about the University appeared in The
Couch, a monthly paper published by local high
school students. most of whom are from Taylor All-
derdice. The quote was part of a story about the
Moratorium activities in Pittsburgh. and it read.

. many colleges and universities across the
country made provisions for observing the Mora-
torium. . . . Pitt is one of these as could be expected
from its relatively liberal administration. (It is a
shame that the administration is much more liberal
than the students themselves )  to

The Pitt News

vs. Reason

Editor. The Pitt News:

I shall try to keep this letter
as brief as my passion permits.
The Pitt News, and various
avante garde celebrities therein
quoted. apparently suffer from a
distinct incapacity to reason.
Rather there is a general trend
toward engaging in fantasy lab-
elling. and sensationalism.

..Referring to the January 19
edition and an article therein, by
Virginia Joyce. she quotes Pro-
fessor David Owens‘ comment
that the silent majority is "the
lowest scum on the earth." Not
knowing myself what the silent
majority may be. I would still
like to know by what authority
Dr. Owens‘ has been deified to
pronounce such finite moral
judgments on others. Further-
more. by what absolute stand-
ards does he characterize the
structure in this country as re-
pressive and racist? Ah. but
alas. I am not privy to the ora-
cle from which Dr. Owens gains
his authority.

Again from Miss Joyce’s arti-
cle she quotes one Reggie Schell
as admonishing somebody (he
does not say whom) to “arm
yourself or harm yourself." If
this is a sequel to Dr. Owens‘
suggestion that pockets of re-
sistance be organized or a move-
ment to the mountains be start-
then Mr. Schell best re-
main a poet (and a poor one at
that) or look elsewhere for his
Christ.

Mr. Tiernan asks in "On Ab-
bie Hoffman." “You don't take
yourself seriously. do you?" I
can assure you that I don't take
Mr. Hoffman seriously or for
that matter Mr. Tiernan after
reading his latest jaunt into the
world of whim and fantasy.

Of Mr. Tiernan I would in-
quire. "What is a pig?" He has
such a proclivity for that word.
Assuming he uses it derogatorily
in reference to the Pittsburgh
Press, the police. or anyone else
he sees fit to so label. I am
again curious to know from

  

A whom he derives his moral auth-

ority r  A

societv Would indeed be repres

As for Mr. Hoffman his mix-
ture of love and the survival of
the fittest marks a peculiar-spec-
ies. I find Mr. Hoffman short on
the former. at least from his

manifestations. \
I sincerely hope The Pitt"
News and those referred to

therein are simply putting their
worst face forward.’There "will
then at least be hope.

Respect For
The Majority

Editor, The Pitt News:

In response to a number of ‘ar-
ticles in the January 19 issue of
The Pitt News concerning our

so—called "repressive“ society. it

is absurd that so many “enlight-
ened" people should. without
reason. attempt to assume the
responsibility for the direction of
our society. The sense of their
responsibility becomes even
more ‘ludicrous when they sug-
gest copping out and "going
into the mountains to survive."

Mr. Tiernan calls the Pitts-
burgh Press the "Pig Publica-
tion". It is hard to understand
how he makes the leap into ob-
jectivity or perhaps omnipotence
that allows him to define excel-
lence for any such institution as
the Pittsburgh Press, when he
apparently has not grappled
with the problems of his less in-
volved paper. as indicated by
recent publications.

More important is the ques-
tion of where one obtains the
right to define excellence for
others.

Tiernan seems to suggest that
we should give the responsibi-
lity for determining excellence
in our society to Abbie Hoff-
man and his colleagues.

Hopefully. the sensationalism
of such respectful phrases as
"the lowest scum on earth“. re-
ferring to our diabolical silent
majority. will keep people in-
tact with their senses. Clearly if
the silent majority were less
responsible and chose to exhibit
their views in any attention-
getting method they could. our

 

 

sive because such conduct would
definitely demonstrate a lack of
respect for anotherfs opinions
and his rights.

Moreover. it is questionable
whether Hoffman believes in a
“nation based on love" or rather
a nation which satisfies his ego
according to what he calls right
and wrong. Do you really think
“Revolution in America is the
only way to live“. dear Abbiei’?

In truth. it appears that these
people ask for radical and im-
mediate change to avoid respon-
sibility rather than totaccept it.
In a constant state .for change.
with no respect for past tradi-
tions. certainly no one has res-
ponsibility for what is right or
wrong; in such a state. right and
wrong is continually mutating.

Thank God the silent major-
ity on this campus is a majority
that realizes change must come
about responsibility with reason
and respect for all mankind.

The Student Cabinet of the
School of General Studies is work-

School of General Studies Council.
The Student Cabinet supports an
amendment to the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences lFASl By-laws
which will assure members of
FAS an active voice in the Gen-

Henry C. Berns. chairman of

stated that. economically speak-

tal budget in three ways( 1) They
pay full tuition. 2) Their class-
room hours weigh heavily in the
allocation of resources through
state subsidies. and 3) Most of
the students in General Studies
have the additional burden of be-
ing taxpayers as well as students.

Jungle Cat supporters are elat-
ed that Coach Ridl‘s squad has
elevated its records from one win.
six losses to four wins. seven loss-

‘ es. One patron. in fact. stepped up

.to‘Buzz Ridl in the locker room

' after the hoopsters‘ third victory
- in four tries at the Field House

and exclaimed. "You're number

 Ridl actually was more con-

cerned that he came out number

the clock, Ridl couldn’t help. but

2- worry that the contest might slip-

away.-Certainly, last week’s last
minute loss to West Virgina must
have painfully entered the coach’s
mind.

From 3:21 to 0:02. however.

of Kent State. Paul O‘Gorek‘s foul

A shot upped the lead to a basket.

Then. Cleveland Edwards con-
nected on the first of two fould
shots. and Mike Patcher grabbed
the rebound. Patcher lined a quick
pass to Kent Scott (whose 17
points paced the scoring). Scott.
however. missed the shot under
_ the basket.

The clincher came when 0‘Gor-

and tossed in a layup that pushed
the Panther advantage to five

Two three second violations
against Kent State and a 35 sec-

the Golden Flashes inability to

A overcome the streaking Panthers.

“We played a good steady game
and we beat a good team. I expect-

Ridl.

nearly fatal Panther cold spell

PROBABLE MAT LINE-IIP

Despite a terrific first half per-
formance by Mike Patcher (12
points and eight rebounds) the
hoopsters could not build up a sub-
stantial lead against the Golden
Flashes. Throughout the entire
half, the score was tied six times

. and lead changed hands twice. At

the half, Kent State trailed 31-25.
However, with only three min-
utes to go, the Flashes stood at a
disadvantage by only a basket,
24-22.

An added treat to victory num-
ber four was the play of Box Ciz-
marik. Bobby played only briefly.
but accounted for nine tallies.

"Cizmarik was a good punch for
us at the end of the first half and
a good punch for us at the begin-
ning of the second half." remark-
ed Ridl. A

Both Ridl and assistant coach
Fran Webster praised the Pan-
therss sharp play at the start of
the second half. The Cats held
leads of 47-36 and 49-38.

"For the first 10 minutes of the
second half. we really played bas-
ketball. We played great defense."
mentioned Webster.

Jim Wherry of Jeanette will
lead Bucknell into town tomorrow
night. He is the Bison’s fifth all-
time scorer. If Bucknell has as
difficult time figuring out the cag-
ers‘ constantly changing and al-
ways complex defense as did Kent
State. the hoopsters will capture
another victory—one more than

I all of last season.

Jim Banners thinclads hit the road again this
weekend as they travel cross-state to Philadelphia
for the Philadelphia Track Classic.

Both invitational and open competition will be
featured in the Classic. and the thinclads will have
numerous entries in each.

‘ In‘ the open competition tomorrow afternoon.
Paul Ponton will compete in the 50 yard dash. Ken
Balkey will be running in the mile. John Aiken will
compete in the 1000 yard run and Bill Kalchthalter
will be entered in the 50-yard high hurdles. In the
field events. freshman Doug Degenhart will be com-
peting in the pole vault.

The invitational competition will be featured
tomorrow night and the tracksters will be repre-
sented in five events.

The record-breaking mile-relay team will be out
to attract national attention with the quartet of
Smitty Brown. Carlos Reisan. Dennis Schatzman
and Dorel Watley running. Ken Balkey. Mike Nolan.

Both grapplers have had excel-
lent records this season. Payne
has a 3-0 record and McClure
maintains a 2-0 standing.

At 150 pounds’ the probable
choice will be Pat Lavery. How-
ever Lavery has sustained a pull-
ed shoulder muscle. He wrestled
despite the injury at West Vir-
ginia and lost his match,'5-4. He
aggravated the injury during the
match, though, and his appear-
ance on the roster is in doubt.

If Lavery is unable to parti-
cipate in the match he will most
likely be ‘replaced by Bud
Smeltz.

‘At 158 pounds sophomore Jim
Flemming or Bud Morris. a jun-
ior. will handle the chores. The
most probable choice however is
Flemming.

At 190 the anticipated starter
is Paul Allen but there is a pos-
sibility that the position will be
filled by Craig Tritch.

Dave Young or Jim Caraman-
na will wrestle in the heavy
weight position.

The Campus bus will transport
students to the match just as it
does for basketball games. Ad-
ams hopes for a large turn out.

Banner explained that the Philadelphia meet
will attract the same caliber of nationally ranked
athletes as did the CYO Maryland meet two weeks
ago. He pointed out that he’ll still be concerned with
times and distances tomorrow, but the times may
be a little slower due to the size of the track.”

“The track at Philadelphia is a smaller track
than we’re used to. You have twelve laps to the
mile there and although your effort may be as great.
the times won‘t be as fast."

The Field House track has eight laps per mile.
while the track at the University of Maryland had
eleven.

In the open competition, Banner anticipates to
see a lot of excellent athletes as well. “Thhe after-

said Banner, It will attract teams and individuals
from all over the East Coast, from Boston to Balti-

in this meet.”
