Dr. Andrey Avinoff
Tells Of ‘Intellectual

Cooperation’ For Peace

By GERTRUDE MESSEROFF

It seems rather paradoxical,
that with all the newspapers
ﬁlled with a fatalistic attitude
toward the impending war, an
attempt should be made to
write about a peace movement.
Yet the public loves an ironical
twist now and then, and natur-
ally enough the reminder that
there does exist a League of Na-
tions and under it an International
Institute of Intellectual Co—opera-
tion, makes attractive reading.

As representative of the Ameri-
can Museum of Science at the 1934
meeting of this Institute, Dr. An-
drey Avinoif, director of the Car-
negie Museum, advisory professor
of biology and assistant professor
of ﬁne arts at the University,
helped present valuable sugges-
tions and encourage a movement
towards international organization.

Functions During Peace

The Committee of Experts on
which Dr. Avinoff served, was one
of the numerous committees under
this Institute. One of the chief ob-
jects of this committee was to pre-
pare good collective instruments of
work, and to make an effort to ob-
tain the best possible working con-
ditions for scholars and scientists.

This business of having an inter-
national committee of scholars to
try to improve inttellectual condi-
tions, and preserve peace over the
world may nott seem logical to
those “thinkers” who rant about
“diplomacy, making war.” But Dr.
Avinoff merely wishes to point out
that this Institute interests itself in
functioning during times of peace.
Intellectual activity cannot live
when nations tear at each other.

Uniting intellectuals of all coun-
tries in a common aim—-Peace, the
International Institute of Intellec-
tual Co—operation has representa-
tives from France, England, Ger-
many, the United States, and many
lesser countries.

Though it has undoubtedly been
strongly re—inforced throughout
the world by the existence of the
intellectual institutions, it has not
yet been able to convert all minds
to its aims. Nevertheless the
ground is gradually being prepared
for its work.

Fosters Understanding

Its policy is an establishment of
close understanding among the dif-
ferent peoples of the world and the
better organization of affairs on a
deﬁnite basis of peace and pros-
perity. It can also do much to fa-
miliarize young people—the future
leaders-—while at school, with the
idea of intellectual collaboration.

It has, for example, organized a
Centre of Education Information
for the Instruction of youth in the
aims and principles of the League
of Nations; it has often successfully
intervened with the governments
to establish this instruction in
schools; it has published several
manuals to guide teachers in giving
such instruction.

Apparently the Institution of In-
tellectual Cooperation, though at
present not a permanent organiza-
tion, will “go places” in the near
future. And, though “not concern-
ed with war,” an international co-
operation of any kind cannot help
but affect such things as the reign
of Hitler, or the pact between
Great Britain and Italy.

Germani Gives

Organ Recital

An organ recital will be given
tonight at 9:30 o’clock in the Com-
mons Room by Germani, Euro-
pean organ virtuoso.

The famous organist, playing on
the University Hammond elec-
tronic organ, will play selections
from the works of Handel and
Debussy. Tomorrow night at
8:30 o’clock, he will play in Car-
negie Music Hall.

Germani started on a nation-
wide tour last fall. It is the ﬁrst
time in history that a person made
a formal tour playing on an elec-
tronic organ. Students, faculty
members, and friends are invited
to attend.

New University
‘Victory Song’
Goes On Sale

University Publishes
March Composition

Of Former Students

Publication of the “Pitt Victory
Song” was announced today by
Theodore Biddle and Robert R.
Corley, assistant deans of men.

The new song is to be placed on
sale at the book store at 25 cents
per copy. Campus salesmen will
also have copies.

' The cover sheet of the song
sheet was made by P. K. Penn,
C39.

The new marching song is to be
played on the Commons Room or-
gan today at 12:35, 1:00, and 1:25
o’clock. Both the University Band
and Glee Club have included the
song on their next home concerts.

Music for the “Victory Song”
was written by Dr. Benjamin Le-
vant, physician graduate of the
University in 1919. G. Norman
Reis, ’16, a chemist, and Louis M.
Fushan, ’23, an attorney, collabor-
ated on the words.

The ﬁrst plans for “The Pitt
Victory Song” were made ﬁve
years ago. It was suggested that
the song be printed by the Uni-
versity, which should retain the
copyright. In this way, the new
song would be available not only
for radio programs, but also for
inclusion in college song books.

Army Oﬂicer Talks
To Inquiry

Today

Colonel Covell
Addresses Group
On Flood Control

Pittsburgh’s problem of ﬂood
control, which reaches a crisis
each spring will be discussed to-
day by Lieutenant—Colonel W. E.
R. Covell, district U. S. engineer,
at Inquiry Forum, meeting at
12:30 o’clock in 129 Cathedral.

Progress of ﬂood control work
in the Pittsburgh district and
other phases of the national ﬂood
control problem will be explained
by Colonel Covell, who has been
in charge of the Pittsburgh office
of Army engineers since shortly
after the record ﬂood of March,
1936.

CONSTRUCTION DELAYED

When he was appointed to his
present position, Colonel Covell
was placed in command of prelim-
inary ﬂood control planning in the
basins of the Allegheny and Mo-
nongahela rivers. Under his di-
rection, the Tygart river reser-,
voir dam, the largest masonry
dam in the eastern United States,
was completed.

Although lack of funds under
the 1936 Federal ﬂood control law
has delayed construction of furth-
er ﬂood control dams in this area,
planning dams at Tionesta and
Crooked Creek has been com-
pleted under Colonel Covell’s di-
rection, and work is scheduled to
start this spring.

AUTHORS PLAN

Before his appointment to the
Pittsburgh oiﬁce of the Army en-
gineers, Colonel Covell was as-
sistant engineer in charge of
maintenance of the Panama Ca-
nal. Previous to that time, he had
been assistant engineer commis-
sioner and executive officer of the
publicity utility commission of
the District of Columbia.

In the District of Columbia, he
was the author of the Washington
plan for control of electric utility
rates, and acted as executive of-
ﬁcer of the zoning commission.

MAKES HAWAIIAN SURVEY

Upon graduation from the U. S.
Military Academy in 1915, Colonel
Covell has risen rapidly in rank.
As active commander of the sec-
ond engineers of the AEF in 1918,
he was the youngest man to hold
such a post.

He was in charge of survey
work on the Island of Oahu, Ha-
waii, for two years after his grad-
uation from West Point. After
the war, he was stationed at Buf-
falo, Washington, the Canal Zone,
and Pittsburgh.

Psychology Head

Attends Conclave

Dr. W. T. Root, dean of the
Graduate School and head of the
department of psychology, is at-
tending a convention of the Amer-
ican Association of School Admin-
istrators being held at Atlantic
City.

Dr. Root will deliver a speech
concerning “Mentally Handicap-
ped Children” before the conven-
tion, which adjourns tomorrow.

SF A Discussion

By IRVING BENNETT
After discussing the pro and
con of anti-Japanese boycotts,
four speakers at the Student-Fac-
ulty Association Forum on Friday

decided that there was still a pro
and con to the question.

Bernard McKenna, C39, and
William Stark, C38, members of
the debating team, spoke in favor
of the boycott. The opposition ar-
gument was presented by Joseph
McCloskey, C38, and Donald
Dammond, C38.

Both sides seemed to agree on
their belief in Japan’s guilt of ag-
gression in the Far Eastern con-
flict, but split on the question of
the effectiveness and practicality
of a boycott. McKenna declared,
“Never have we seen such a na-
tion (Japan) so vulnerable to a
boycott.” McCloskey countered
that “it increases the possibilities
for war, does not lessen them.”
In the opening argument, Mc-
Kenna held that the boycott was
justiﬁed and practical. “It is our
one chance to avoid participation
in the Far-Eastern war,” he said.
“The boycott has already been ef-
fective. Silk imports have fallen
about 30 per cent and chain store

Question Of Japanese Boycott

Fails To Solve

buyers are saying that people are
not buying Japanese goods.”

“Peace must be founded on eco-
nomic justice,” said Dammond. He
claimed the boycott was neither
effective nor just, and was ex-
tremely dangerous. “It is not the
Japanese people who are to
blame,” he said, “but their war
machine. With a boycott it is
easy to whip feelings to a war-
time fervor.”

Arguing against the effective-
ness of a boycott, McCloskey said
boycott would dislocate the silk
industry. He expressed his doubt,
whether, as McKenna claimed, an
economic boycott could be sepa-
rated from a political action. “Will
the Japanese people be able to
see this?” he questioned.

Stark argued that “Any partic-
ular policy always discomforts
some people. The dislocation of
the silk industry will bring a
problem comparable to that when
new industries are created. Silk
workers will ﬁnd new jobs, be ab-
sorbed. Anyway, there is an
agency of the Federal government
which can take care of them for
the present.”

Milton Lehman, C39, was.chair-

man of the meeting.

Event Will Mark
Commemoration

Of State Grant

There will be 151 candles,
ﬁguratively speaking, on the
University’s birthday cake to-

day, and the General Alumni‘
Association is sponsoring a ball
tonight in the University Club
to celebrate the event.

For the ﬁrst time since Penn-
sylvania’s General Assembly grant-
ed a charter in 1787 to the “Pitts-
burgh Academy,” a log cabin at
the Point, from which the Univer-
sity is descended, Charter Day
will be celebrated by a ball. In
the past, banquets, teas, or recep-
tions have marked the event.

CHANCELLOR TO ATTEND

According to Earl Crawford,
BAl6, ﬁrst vice president of the
Alumni Association and general
chairman of the ball, the theme of
the decorations for the ballroom
will be the University’s 151 years
of progress from one-story log
cabin to 42-story Cathedral of
Learning. Chancellor John G.
Bowman will be an honor guest at
the ball.

One of the main features of the
affair will be a radio broadcast
from 9 to 9:30 over KDKA, and its
short-wave station W8XK, directly
from the ballroom. Dr. John B.
Sutherland and Norman MacLeod,
president of the General Alumni
Association, will speak during the
broadcast.

FORMAL AFFAIR

A unit of the University Band

Coed Debaters

Oppose Fenn
Team Today

University Women
To Give Negative Side
Of NRLB Discussion

Marking its ﬁfth intercollegiate
event of the year, representatives
of the University Women’s Debat-
ing Association will present the
negative side of an NLRB ques-
tion when they oppose the Fenn
College team today at 12:30
o’clock in 132 Cathedral.

Participants from the Univer-
sity are Jeannette Swartz, C38,
and Florence Hiller, BA38, argu-
ing negatively on the question,
“Resolved: that the National La-
bor Relations Board should be
empowered to enforce arbitration

'in all industrial disputes.”

Miss Genevieve Blatt, coach of
the women’s; debating squad, ex-
tends an invitation to all inter-
ested persons to attend the meet-
ing.

Opening the series of intercol-
leegiate appearances with a tour
in the middle of January, the W0-
men’s debating team met Seton
Hill, Gettysburg, and Buckness.
The Penn State team traveled to
Pittsburgh on February 22 for the
fourth intercollegiate meeting this
year. ‘

Many of the debates this year
were given before women’s clubs
and high schools in or around
Pittsburgh. Subjects in these de-
bates mainly were on unicameral
legislation.

Members of the Association who
have been active in debates
throughout this season are: Mar-
garet Byrne, Ed39; Lorraine Simp-
son, C39; Sophia Nelson, Ed38;
Hilary Lurie, C40; Verne Etter,
C40; Gertrude Broido, C39; Goldie
Katz, C39; Lea Hirsch, Ed38;
Jeannette Swartz, C38; and Flor-
ence Hiller, C38.

To make a lasting accomplish-
ment in life, one should rise above
the “cloud ceiling” of material
things to a state in which he can
express his “whole self,” Chancel-
lor John G. Bowman told students
at Friday morning’s assembly in
Memorial Hall.

Making his ﬁrst appearance of
the year before a student assem-
bly, Dr. Bowman warned students
to avoid the “fear that is a de-
feat,” and to seek moments of ex-
pression of “the best things that
are in you.“

“Too many people,” he said, “go
along under a cloud of fear, liv-
ing some of their life, but only
part of it. Too few of us rise
above this to a sublime serenity
which comes out of time, out of
space, and results in lasting ac-
complishment.

“If a student can get into the
habit of rising above the material
things about him, and his rise

ceases to be just an esthetic re-
sponse to the beautiful and be-

comes something more
cant, then he can express his
whole self. The great criticism
of this age is that we don’t often
rise to that height.”

Presenting his idea of the spirit
of the Cathedral, Dr. Bowman ex-
plained that the Commons Room
was intended to create an “atmos-
phere” in which students could
“break through that cloud ceil-
ing” of materialism more easily.

“The arches in that room cry
out victory and adventure. The
room is an effort to express in
stone a courage and individuality
that is not afraid of anything. The
Commons Room expresses a de-
sire to reach an esthetic and spir-
itual response to the beautiful—
to waken life to its whole mean-
ing,” he declared.

“We live in an age when art
is looked upon as unnecessary.
But art is essential to any great
life. We have a vastly exagger-
ated picture of the economic side
of life; there are many things more

signiﬁ-

important than that.”

Labor Relations
Take ‘Full Time’
Of NLRB Head

Dr. J . Warren Madden, chairman
of the National Labor Relations
Board, who has been on leave of
absence from his position as pro-
fessor of law, has resigned his
University post, according to an
announcement from the office of
Chancellor John G. Bowman.

Dr. Madden, who has been on
leave of absence from the Univer-
sity since 1935, submitted his
resignation in a letter to the
Board of Trustees two weeks ago.
It was accepted by the executive
committee of the Board in a meet-
ing last Thursday.

RESIGNATION ACCEPTED

According to the report, the la-
bor board chairman tendered his
resignation because of the “full-
time” nature of his government
position. Dr. Madden, it was
stated, expressed his desire to be
relieved of his University posi-
tion in order that he may give
full attention to duties with the
NLRB.

Immediately upon accepting
his resignation, the Board of
Trustees’ executive committee

passed a resolution praising the
work of Dr. Madden in the Uni-
versity School of Law and wish-
ing him success in his govern-
ment activity.
LAW DEAN

Appointed to the chairmanship
of the NLRB in August, 1935,
shortly after the creation of the
Board, Dr. Madden has served in
that capacity ever since. Under
his direction, the Board as an in-
dependent agency has achieved
national prominence, handling a
grand total of 6,479 labor dis-
putes, and stirring up much con-
troversy in its administration of
the Wagner Labor Act.

Dr. Madden was appointed pro-
fessor of law at the University in
1927. Previously he held similar
positions at the University of Ok-
lahoma, and Ohio State. From
1917-27 he was’ clean of the Col-
lege of Law and professor of law
at West Virginia University.

Kiss Included
In Owl’s Photo
Story Of Date

What will The Owl staff think
of next?

After thinking up pages of new
ideas for the yearbook, the edi-
tors have issued some more bright
ideas. This time it concerns their
dance section.

The story of one man’s date will
be told in The Owl this year, go-
ing up to and including a cozy
scene in the park featuring a cor-
rect dance kiss.

Instead of including posed pic-
tures of the dance chairmen with
their dates, The Owl shows in-
formal photographs, in addition to
the committee pictures. The pic-
tures start off with the chairman
of the Freshman Dance talking
with his date’s mother.

Then on the succeeding pages,
other scenes in the dance night are
given, concluding with the ﬁnal
“kiss” shot. Along with the photo-
graphs is informal material on
people at the dances.

The Owl undergraduate sales-
men are now taking orders on
campus for the yearbook. Orders
are also being received at the of-
fice, 801 Cathedral.

From Cloud Ceiling
To Arid Earth

.,])R. BOWlVIAN’S address last‘ Fridaytwas. an

answer to the request by SEA that the
Chancellor should speak on his theories of edu-
cation and his problems at the University be-

» fore the student body.

Dr. Bowman replied to that request before. a
highly iiiterested auditorium. Hereplied by)
«indicating that the great problem of modern
youth was a. pliobia—a deep-seated fear which
serves to stfiﬂe the aims and the ambitions.

His developed thesis was presented by a ﬁg-
ure: “Too many people," he said, “go along
under a cloud of fear, living some of their life,
Too few of us rise above
this to a sublime serenity which comes out of
time, out of space, and resul.ts in lasting ac-
complishment. ”

\Ve are grateful for the Chancellor’s ad-
dress, especially for his earnest desire to reach
the student body. “I want to speak person-
ally to you,” Dr. Bowman said from the Me-
morial Hall stage. And it is good that he spoke.

But we would raise a question: in order that
we may dismiss our fears, our doubts, our prob-
lems concerning university life, is it possible
that we do so by the single process of for-
getting? F irther, may we dismiss economic
questions, social questions, educational ques-
tions by pretending that they don’t exist?

\Ve accept Dr. Bowinan’s declaration that we
are fearful, fearful because we do not under-
stand and we want to know. Fearful because
we see fear about us.

Youth has a tradition that falls completely
in line with Dr. Bowinan’s charge to courage.
But youth, present’ day youth, has mixed its
courage with questions.

Dr. Bowman told us much that we already
feel, much that we- already. are convinced is
right. But, if youth may doubt, youth must
ask: how are we to obtain. our individual posi-
tions above the clouds of fear if we ignore the
intervening strata?

There are things we feel we must know. VVe
appreciate the Chancellor’s address, and we
await the next assembly, hoping that Dr. Bow-
man will be more speciﬁc.

Well...
I Think

Letters

Editor, The Pitt News:

Much as I respect the authoritative sources of Mr.
SafIron’s information, I see in his “factual” presen-
tation of certain actions on the part of various army
and administrative officials in Washington, a petty
attempt to personify our President as a vicious war-
mad maniac, fanatically desirous of precipitating a

 
 

A world War.

Now that we have a second hand report on the
personal, conﬁdential remarks of the President, hav-
ing indirectly reached the ears of Mr. Saﬁron——-the
United Press and Associated Press notwithstanding,
a look back at the President’s direct and official ac-
tivity——about which we are all aware——-might be
somewhat enlightening.

He has taken U. S. marines out of Nicaragua,
Cuba——has worked strongly for the independence of
the Philippine Islands, all in order to avoid foreign
entanglements. He has endorsed a bill to destroy
great proﬁts of millionaires during time of war, a
bill to eliminate the traitorous actions of munition
makers.

In words ringing around the world, he has told us
that “I HATE VVAR.” He has cooperated with all
peace-loving nations.

I wonder if Mr. Saffron is not too quick in accept-
ing what somebody heard—who told somebody else

———who told Mr. Saffron.
-——Gerald Ziskind, C41.

Editor, The Pitt News:

It appears to me that in all this hullabaloo over.
recognizing the ASU on the Pitt Campus, the pri-I

rnary issue——from the student point of view-—has
been somewhat neglected.

The facts in the fuss are these: SFA, acting sup-
posedly on behalf of the student electorate, has de-
cided thatithe ASU, a propaganda group organized
for the purpose. of achieving certain social ends
which come outside the strict purview of University
life, shall not thrive and ﬂaunt its purposes on cam-
pus; that, in general, propaganda of a social char-
acter is not in keeping with the high ideals of educa-
tion; that, in the interest of these same high ideals
of education, University students should be protected
from outside inﬂuences which are deleterious to
purely impartial, pedagogic thought.

Perhaps such an opinion is truly representative of
student feeling, in which case it must be considered
as ultimate and ﬁnal for the time being at least.
But a thoughtful minority will never cease to argue
the lack of wisdom inherent in the SFA point of
view.

This minority does not believe that the cause of
true education is much furthered by repression, by
making ﬁne distinctions as to what is and what is
not proper subject-matter of undergraduate thought
on the assumption that students are “immature”
and therefore need protection; or by removing the
stimulus to an agitated state-of—mind which intimate
contact with other students espousing new move-
ments so often provokes. .

On the contrary, this minority insists that ex-
posure to new and strange ideas is good for the un-

A dergraduate: that it will jolt him out of his accus-

tomed rut. and make him think; force him to ex-
amine the causes and purposes of existence more
fully; enlarge his experience and make him more
conscious of his age.

‘ And surely thinking is not to be condemned on any
score. In -anticipation of the argument that the
majority of students would think in emotional terms
and therefore go off pretty well half-cocked, we re-
ply,/that half-cockedness even so is, a liberalizing
experience, -the effect of which will be quickly
enough dissipated when the student settles down to
a job, afamvily, and a typical American life.

What we want, then, is not less propaganda but

more. We want to be overwhelmed, submerged,
smothered, buried! And we want to dig our own
way out!

By Clarence. Wible

Westbrook Pegler,_ ace back-biter for the NEA
service, has been conducting an interesting personal
investigation of vice conditions in several of the
larger cities. Chicago was the first to draw his ﬁre;
Kansas City is taking a lambasting now.
Withthese investigations in mind, one can almost
hear the boys in our own City Hall shout out loudly
in pious tones, “Thank God we’re pure!”
drowning out these holier-than-thou wails is the
loud noise raised about the raiding of The White
Mansion, the gambling resort on the Perry Highway
near the Pines.

This resort has been operating openly for at least

cept our police and detective forces. It is possible
that our guardians of the law have been so busy
learning how: to shoot to kill that they have over-
looked the scurrilous goings—on -at’The Mansion.
Or is it possible that the boys knew about it all
along?

Peep-Hole . . .

But let’s assume that the boys on the “detective”
force didn’t know anything about The White Man-
sion. Was there anything suspicious about the
place? Well, ostensibly, The*White Mansion was a
fashionable eating and drinking place.
But built into the front. door -was a very. efficient
peep-hole, reminiscent of the Prohibition-day speak-
easies. This "peep-hole was obviously not built to
satisfy the voyeuristic tendencies of our city" detec-
tives. And, although the ‘place was operating’full-
blast, the windows were always tightly shuttered.
To keep out the cold, boys? -
The Liquor Control Board ﬁnally brought about
the breaking of the place. A few of .their, men vis-
ited the resort to satisfy their curiosity as to the
liquor permits. Once inside they took a look around
and, upstairs, they found two rooms completely fur-
nished with all manner of gambling equipment.
They notiﬁed a. city judge. He, in turn, notiﬁed the
detective crew. Then the boys swung -into action.

Silencium. Est . . .

it, and after you have become a‘ permanent

Half the city, some state govermnent menoutside
the city police forces, and a city judge knew‘ about
the activities that went on inside The White Man-
sion before the detectives knew anything or did any-
thing about it. If they were in ignorance of the
place, they should all be discharged as preemptorily
as the city patrolman was who stole a bottle of gin
from the scene of an automobile accident just re-
cently.

ing it for reasons too obvious to mention, then our
city, also, could stand a little of the Pegler type of
castigation. ‘

It’s all very well to clean up on amateur racketeers
of the Schenley high-school boy type, to tag cars
for ﬁve-minute illegal parking, and to arrest inno-
cent people on suspicious person charges. But why
not forget the old “cut” or “take-in” for a while
and concentrate on the White Mansions, the Mill-
vale resorts (boasting from 100 to 200 cars of at Sat-
urday night), and the Wylie Avenue, Swissvale, and
Rankin joints. .

But, of course, boys, this is just a suggestion from
someone who hasn’t been around as much as you
have. The information is FREE. ’

Persian Student Gives

Tall Buildings, Dense Population Of ‘America L
Impress Jelali, But He Prefers Native Land
By MILDRED AKSELRAD
In the English language, Mehdi means Guide, Shirazi, the
name of the city in which he was born, and J alali, Glorious.

, Mehdi Shirazi J alali, whose home is in Teheran, is here at
Pitt on one of the hundred scholarships given by the Persian
He is a transfer from VVashington
Jefferson College and Columbia University. An educational
psychology major, Jalali intends to return to his “land of the

either for the government or in a
University.

:FAVORITE DISH POLOW
“Persia is no longer Persia,”
J alali said emphatically. “It is

and large, and e_very,f_amily has a
home, and no one lives in apart-
ments. .Each. family has its own
home, courtyard, and garden.”

1' The main food is bread, rice, and
meat. ’ They have no alcohol with
their«meals- as such beverages are
prohibited by the religion. J alali’s
favorite dish is Polow, containing
“rice and butter and some other
kind of combination.”

 RESPECT CHURCHES

The Persians are a religious peo-
ple,!=and Jalali belong. to the sect
known; as" the Eslectic, who pick
the best -things -from life. “We
have great respect for our
churches, which we‘ call mosques.
Our mosque is a House of God. We
must always enter wearing only
clean clothes, and at time of pray-
er there is absolute silence.”

There are two kinds of Persian
holidays: holidays for birth and

nightingales and ﬂowers,” to work¢

days, and mourn on death days.”
The New Year begins March 21,
for it is only natural for the year
to start with spring and end with
winter.

Jalali is a great sports fan, and
he was familiar with every Amer-

called Iran.” Our country is vast  jean game except “this tough f0ot_

ball.” American people measure
inch by inch the opposite team. “I
like to see football, but I would
hate to play it,” Jalali shook his
head and laughed.
OMAR KHAYYAIVI

And Persian girls? They dress
more Parisian than American girls
dress. Until the new law _ was
passed, girls were permitted to
marry at the age of nine, but now
they mustbe sixteen. “They are
pretty. They are active. They are
dark. They are a serious and
progressive sex,” Jalali smiled.

Concerning O m a r Khayyam,
Jalali has a nationalistic feeling for
the great Persian writer. In his
slow musical voice, Jalali said,
“We do not praise Omar Khayyam
for the things you Americans do.
You praise him because his lyrical
books are popular here. We praise
him for his genius in science and

death. “We celebrate on birth

mathematics.”

to me_ a thoroughly agreeable and
entertaining comedy. You» will
probably like it too if you want

taining; if not, you might as well

Heading the cast is Robert Young
who plays: the part of a good look-
ing poor boy with several unusual
peculiarities. Chief amongst these
is his knack of winning contests.
At the time the picture was made

in all. Close second in the way of
uniqueness was his permitting a

and the woman he loved. It was
this that created most of the trou-

pleasant two hours.

Florence Rice is the woman he
loves and she, poor thing is ﬁlthy
withschillings. (For any lechers
who have read this far I add that
a schilling is an Austrian coin.)
Florence realizes Robert’s unusual
qualities and because she loves him
she hides the fact that she is
daughter of the man who owned

Shamateurism Given Blast,
A Remedy Is Proposed

By Leonard Levison

 

"95
it

That there is something not altogether wholesome in the
way so-called amateur sport is being conducted in the United
States is a situation that the nation ’s sport-followers have been

aware of forslsome time.

But, nothing has reallyrbeen done about scrubbing out the

set-up. There have been small,¢

sniping attempts here and there
along the line. However, be-
cause of the system that has be-
c_ome entrenched, they have either
gradually been abandoned or else
have stood out as isolated spots,

ineffective in curing the whole‘

IIIBSS.
O O I

«Call To Arms

Sports Illustrated, that sophis-
ticated sporting journal, labels the
whole thing, “Shamateurism.” In a
rather interesting call to arms, the
editors expound the situation and
propose a wholesale solution.

Making themselves clear with
regard to the nature of their at-
tack, the editors say, “Let it be
clearly understood, first of all,
that we hold no brief against pro-
fessionalism per se; on the con-
trary we are great enthusiasts for
professional sport when conducted
on an honest basis. What we do
object to . . is the intolerable
sham and sniveling hypocrisy
which surround so many branches
of amateur athletics.”

“Take the case of Mr. Donald
Budge, technically an amateur
tennis player . . . the impeccable
Mr. Budge is in Australia play-
ing exhibition matches which fans
pay $7.50 to watch.”

“When, recently, the Californ-
ian failed to put forth his best
efforts during one of these ex-
pensive demonstrations of ama-
teur skill, he was bitterly de-
nounced by fans and press alike;
Perhaps we stress too subtle a
point when we suggest that it’s a
mystery to us why any amateur

should owe a debt to his public.”
* * $

Budge Paid

“Of course it happens that Mr.
Budge has lived solely on his ten-
nis game for at least three years,
ably supported by the benevolent
fathers of the U. S. L. T. A., who
have investedwisely and well in
expense money to keep him go-
ing. And it’s also true that Mr.
Budge is or has been on the pay-
roll of a sporting goods firm at
a figure reputed to be. $7,500 a

year. Can Mr. Budge honestly be
termed an amateur? Certainly
not.”

Other ﬂagrant case histories
are cited by the editors with re-
gard _to amateur hockey, and in-
tercollegiate football. As they
say, “We could continue the black-

list almost indeﬁnitely. Track,
skiing, golf, badminton, boxing,
and swimming . . . all have pro-
fessionals posing as amateurs and
getting away with it. While this
does not appear so terribly im-
portant on the surface, it does get
down to basic principles of right
and wrong."

“Aside from all questions of
right and wrong, shamateurism
works a hardship on the com-
petitor who is in the game purely
for the love of it. ‘.Many a ﬁne’
tennis player refulses ‘to center
tournaments ,.either .bec3..us,e "he:

realizes "he" has littlei ”c'l"ian_ce ‘to.

upset subsidizedf troupers, or be-,
cause he refuses to sacrifice his
principlesand become one of the
latter.” ’

To start off remedying all of
this,‘ Sports Illustrated presents a
“workable cure.”

_O C $

Suggested Solution

First, is the es_tab'lishment.of a
National Sports Board, represent-
ing every sport , and . paying the
traveling expenses of its represen-
tatives. The purpose of the board
is to determine who is an ama-
teur, and who is not. Recommen-
dations for the board are Presi-
dent Hutchins of Chicago" Univer-
sity, Grantland Rice, Gene Tun-
ney, Ford Frick, Glenna Collett

VVare, and Asa Bushnell.

Secondly, the adoption by the
board of a standard code to cover
all amateur athletics. Other
recommendations include provis-
ion against all traveling expenses,
except scholastic and collegiate
competition. And, also, every
team representing a commercial
enterprise should be dubbed pro-
fessional When admission is
charged.

‘I4 * *

Efficacy Uncertain
Perhaps, this is a solution. At
least, it’s a sporting proposition to
do something about the whole, sor-
ry affair. It would, if it ever gains
whole-hearted approval, be strik-
ing in the right direction.
Personally, I admire its forth-
rightness. It doesn’t pull any
punches in swinging at evils that
have heretofore not been recog-

‘ nized. But, I believe that it will

fall short of being a full remedy
because it doesn’t cut into the roots
of the problem. Anyway, until an
angel comes along, We’ll swing
along with it.

‘Mighty Little Men’ Make Up Ice Team’ s Line

Schooley, Friday, Brittain League’s Smallest

There’s  Chance
In Hockey For A
Good Little Man

By JIM DAILEY

They call themselves, “The
mightiest little men on the ice,”
and their opponents are begin-
ning to believe it.

Dick Friday—coiner of the

phrase—Bob Schooley, and Tay-
lor Brittain are the “mighty
little men” and they are the
ﬁrst line of Pitt’s potent hockey
team. They are also the smallest
players in the Ohio-Pennsylvania
collegiate league, averaging
pounds, and by all odds the small-
est ﬁrst line. "C v
BACK-CHECKERS

The trio isithe result of Coach
.McSorley"s .eifo'rt‘_to"‘ﬁndt an of-
fensive punch and at .the7 same
time develop a competent back-
checking‘ trio. ‘They have come
through nobly, becoming the most
aggressive’ and fastest back—check-
ing combinationin the league. '

Dick Friday,‘ Who balances the
scales at .129 after 'a particularly
heavy dinner, is the spear—head of
a combined ‘offensive-defensive
manuever that _McSorley* has , de-
signed for the “mighty little men.”
s Friday’s part in theplan is to
skate‘ into‘ enemy ‘territory and
heckle the man with the puck,
ing to intercept passes and gener-
ally becoming a nuisance. Mean-

chance to skate in for a shot if
Friday gets the puck, and if not,
they check the men who have
eluded Friday.

,WORKED AGAINST DUKES

The Duquesne game of a few
weeks ago is a good example of
how the plan works. Vance, their
star center and playmaker,
couldn’t shake Friday, who rushed
him and the other Duke forwards
continually, with the result that
most of the game was spent down
on their ice.

Schooley and Brittain shot the

puck consistently at the ice at the
net, and sooner or later one was
bound__to get in.
It made things comparatively
easy for”the defense,’ Goalie Ellis
having only a few chances, and
defense men Lovett and Broido
bowled over the few Dukes who
did get by.

Schooley, the heavyweight and
mainstay of the line, is the most

experienced player on the squad,

being the only one who has played
in organized amateur_hockey. He
played, while in high school,,for

"the champion‘ Scott-Morgans in-_

the City league ofa fewyears ag’o;:

the league’, being 17 at ._the time,

the team in scoring and is consid-
ered one of the more rugged mem-
bers of the squad, despite his lack
of weight. He is hard to upset,
as he skates with the wide-apart
stance used by professionals.

Taylor Brittain at right wing is
the most inexperienced of the trio,
but to off-setthat is also consider-
ed to be the best skater on the
team. ‘ He’s the man with the rub-
ber legs. '

USES GUN ,

Brittain, who wears glasses and’
a mask in action did not have
much of a shot in the ﬁrst few
games of the season, but now car-
ries around what hockey players
call a “gun.”

The acquiring of this “gun’f
happened. rather suddenly. Brit-.
tain remained on the ice after a
practice session one day and was
trying vainly tto get some “zing”
into his shots.

A ‘,He.tried__everything, and ﬁnally

‘balance. {He fell, but followed . .
‘.through with the shot anyway.

and Taylor had it licked.

‘He says, he ﬁgured it to have

vsomethi-ng to do with keeping the

stick -on the puck as ‘ong as pos-
sible, "or in other words, the good

old “follow-through.”

BASKETBALL

A new intramural basketball
champion is assured.

Chemical Engineers, defend-
ing champions, fell out of play
when they were defeated in a hard
fought game by their heated riv-
als, the Mechanical Engineers.
Kappa Alpha Phi, favorites, ad-
vanced to the second round by
conquering the Metallurgist Sen-
iors, 18-15. Softies won from Psi
Omega via the forfeit routs.

 

SWIMMING

An Intramural swimming con-
test will be held at the Trees Gym
in the very near future. This
important announcement comes
from Mr. Rooker’s office.

It is hoped to have all fraterni-
ties enter teams so that competi-
tion can be of the highest caliber.
Independents are] urged to start
lining up their teams and submit
them to Mr. Rooker at Trees Gym.

A trophy will be awarded to
the fraternity scoring the most
points and gold and silver medals
in form of keys will be awarded
to winners of each race. Anyone
having won numerals in swim-
ming is ineligible to compete.

The tentative schedule of events
lists the 40, 60, 100, and 220-yard
freestyles; 40 and 100-yard back-
stroke; 40 and 100-yard breast-
stroke; 20 and 300-yard medley
relay; 400-yard freestroke relay;
and diving.

This is the ﬁrst time in the his-
tory of the school that an intra-
mural swimming meet has been
carded. All records will stand
until they are broken by succeed-
ing meets of this variety.

WAA To Hold
Second Outing

As a result of the success of the
ﬁrst WAA outing held at Laurel
Ridge during mid—summer re-
cess, the Women’s Athletic Asso-
ciation is planning‘ a similar af-
fair to be held at the same place
on March 11 to 13.

Foreseeing an enthusiastic turn-
out for the week—end, the number
of coeds who may attend the out— -
ing has been limited to 15, this
number to be made up of only
seven women who did not attend
the last affaiar.

“If seven new names do not ap-
pear by March 4 on the paper
posted in the twelfth ﬂoor wo-
men’s lounge, the 15 women who
attended the last outing will re-
turn to Laurel Ridge again,”
warns Helen Laucik, Ed39, who
is in charge of the affaiar.

Transportation, to Laurel Ridge
will be provided, and the charge
for the week-end, is $2.50 per
person.

Nice Gamer! War
Idle Reporter Spends Time Thinking
About Leads For War

By BILL MAZEFSKY
That daily trek up to the stadium ofﬁce for the necessary

sport news gives moments for reflections.

Also is very good ex-

ercise for the leg muscles, but the primary object of this piece is
to settle a moot question. What, if anything, does a sport ’s re-

porter think about?

Does he think about Johnny \Voodruff's chances up in New
York‘! Does he wonder about the Japanese Boycott? Or maybe

he trys
there’ll be chocolate’ cake or apple
pie for dessert tonite.

Lately he has been puzzled. It
seems that he happened, by sheer
accident, to read the front page.
Usually he read Joe Williams and
the rest of sport page, and then
maybe glances at the comics. But
this time he saw something about
War splattered all over the ﬁrst
page. War is something like a
game except that nobody has_ any
fun, everybody gets fouled, and
there is no referee around. So
our hero read all about the War.

JUICY BATTLE

Japan and Germany and Italy
and England and France and,
somehow, United States were all
getting ready for a juicy Battle
Royal. The sport reporter as
usual spent his next hike to the
stadium wondering. Usually he
was bothered with his leads. The
tendency on the sport page had
been toward cute leads. He had
been having a good deal of
difficulty being cute thrice a week
for ea-ch issue of The News.

Somehow his reﬁections were

to ﬁgure out whethel¢

troubled. His mind kept sliding
back to that front page story he
had read. No sports reporter
should allow himself to read the
front page because he might start
thinking he shouldn’t think. The
six war-like nations kept seeping
in on his sport leads.
CUTE LEADS

Suddenly our hiking lad was
smitten with a pip of an idea.
What if all those nations did
go to war. Wow, what a news
story! What a cute lead could be
tacked onto that story. Some-
thing like, “Today at noon Japan,
Germany, and Italy advised Eng-
land, France, and United States
that henceforth it will be the ob-
ject of the Japanese, German, and
Italian army to make mincemeat
of the English, French, and Amer-
ican armies.”

Or, “No longer will the Japan-
ese, German and Italian soldiers
cordially greet American, English,
and French soldiers on meeting-—
oh, dear, no, a state of war now
exists and they’ll have to shoot
each other.”
