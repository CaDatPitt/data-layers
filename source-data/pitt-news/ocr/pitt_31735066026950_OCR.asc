Students approve meal plan

...l3ut changes are needed

CWO prepares for ’Take

Back the Night’ march I

By Nathan Hughes
Staff‘ Writer

Students came and voiced their approval for the current’ Block
Meal Plan in a Food Service Committee meeting last Thursday after-
noon. .

The consensus was that the current meal plan is satisfactory, but
that it could use a few changes to make it a better system for the stu-
dents. ' '

“Give it another shot,” said Student Government Board member
John Callahan. “This year it was a learning experience for both [the
Food Service Committee] and the students. Next year, all‘ the bugs ,
will be worked out and it will be an efficient system.” _

One of the biggest problems that students encounter with the cur-
rent system is that there are too many BLOCKS in the system. Many
feel the current number of BLOCKS, 210, is much too high.

“The answer is to reduce the number of BLOCKS required for stu-
dents to purchase, and not to change the system,” said SGB member
John Capriotti.

Director of Food Services Betsy Sallade-Farina said she believes
this problem can be remedied.

“We can revise the BLOCKS so there aren’t quite so many blocks
in the BLOCK Plan, so we get our price point that we need to cover
our operating cost and students don’t have so many BLOCKS at the
end of the semester,” Sallade-Farina said.

“Another problem students had was the fact that they wanted some
sort of credit back if they didn’t use an entire BLOCK. For instance,
if a student uses $5-worthof BLOCKS on a $4.20’ purchase, no
change is given back to the student. Under the current system, the
student eats the $.80 left over. .

“Students didn’t like the fact that if they spent only $4 and had to
use a $5 BLOCK, they didn’t receive change back,” said Sallade-
Farina. '

» At the meeting, the Food Service Committee proposed an entirely
new meal plan for the upcoming Fall semester. The plan consisted of

students receiving a designated number of meals per week on a “use

Pitt’s Campus Women’s
Organization is preparing to
walk the streets of Oakland to
bring the issues of rape and
sexual assault out in the open.

_ At Thursday night’s meeting
in David Lawrence Hall, CWO
prepared posters, some saying
“I’m Taking My Power Back,”
for the “Take Back The Night”
march which will take place
on Thursday, April 5, at 7 p.m.

“We hope with this march
we can accomplish a growing
awareness and understanding
of the effects of sexual assault
and sexual violence,” said
Stephanie" Sudzina, co-presi-
dent of CWO. W

This can be accomplished
because “with the university
community coming together, it
will add in the education of
this problem and help in pro-
ducing solutions for the prob-
lem,” said Sudzina.

Along with the posters,
CWO will also have a clothes-
line hanging over the patio of
the William Pitt Union with T-
shirts on it that have the names
of women who have survived
sexual violence and women

who have lost their lives to
violence. I

Anyone can get a T-shirt
hung up on the clothesline in
time for the march by going to
the William Pitt Union patio.

Different colors will represent '

different forms of violence
against the women.

A white shirt is for women
who have died, yellow or
beige is for women who have
been raped or sexually assault-
ed, blue or green is for women
who are survivors of childhood
sexual abuse and purple or
lavender is for women who
/were attacked because of their
sexual orientation.

The clothesline will also

hang in Washington at the
national “Take Back The
Night” march.

The march will start at
Camegie-Mellon University at
7 p.m. in front of Warner Hall.
There will be a_speaker named
“Katie” there. “Katie” is an
individual who started telling
her story of sexual violence at
“Take Back The Night”
marches everywhere and has
now dedicated her life to
speaking out against sexual
violence,
Sudzina.

isn’t tops on my list.

Second, on my Windows 95
checklist is the much talked about
“menu bar.” Rumor has it, the
menu bar on the bottom of the
screen is Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates’ favorite feature. This bar is
made up of buttons. On the far
left, there is a “customizable”
menu to which you can add fre-
quently used programs, docu-
ments and folders. The rest of this
bar is ﬁlled as more folders and
programs are opened.

I am a Macintosh owner, and a
big problem with the MacOS is
when a folder is opened, it dis-
plays a window. When a second,
sub-folder is opened, it often cov-
ers the ﬁrst window. This is a bit

. annoying, but Microsoft has come

up with a great solution. This bot-
tom menu displays the names of
folders, so you can instantly see a
folder, no matter how deeply it is
covered by other screens. All you
do is click the name, and it moves
itself to the top of the pile. It’s a
nice feature that in theory could be
used. Yes, in theory. I always
ended up closing all the top win-
dows in order to cﬁsplay the bot-
tom ones, never using the bottom
menu bar.

Third is a Microsoft buzzword
and nothing more. Plug-and-play
technology is another great idea,
on paper. Getling plug-and-play to
work is another story. Plug-and-
play essentially means what is
says. Let’s say you are running
Windows 95 and you buy a brand
new CD—ROM reader. With the
old version of Windows, you

would have to install driver soft-
ware from an enclosed disk, then
spend the next two hours tweak-

ing the conﬁguration ﬁles to get it

to work with your system. \Vith
Windows 95, you simply install
the hardware, tell the operating
system what the device is, brand
name and model number, and
Windows 95 will take care of the

rest, in theory. With the beta ver- .

sion I had, plug-and-play was
implemented, but not one of the
devices I had were available to be
installed. So, to sum it up, if the
software engineers at Microsoft
can get it worldng, Plug-and-Play
would be a dream come true.

All in all, Windows 95 offered a
lot. Of course, there are problems.
The beta itself was shipped on 20
ﬂoppy disks, and the 500-some
page manual is a bit intimidating
to the average user. Microsoft is
now more than a year late on the
release of the operating system.
This may also be a drawback

Then, of course, ﬂiere is another
operating system called OS/2
WARP. This was released by IBM
and offers many features that

‘Windows 95 is bragging about

and then some. The best thing
about OS/2 is that it is actually
available to buy, unlike Windows
95. Windows 95 is anxiously
awaited by much of the PC com-
munity. OS/2 is out there waiting
for us. Which will you choose?
I’d recommend getting a lot of
background information on both
and then making a decision. Then

activities and games that ranged
from wheelchair decorating to
basketball.

Each of the children were
paired up for the day with a Pitt
student volunteer who escorted
them throughout the festival and
served as a mentor as well as a
friend.

"There was a letter in The Pitt
News trying to make people feel
guilty, and I felt guilty,” said
John Cihon, a sophomore who
was among many Pitt students
who offered their time and dedi-
cation to making the life of one
child a little brighter.

“It’s a powerful motivator,” he
said.

Along with the games and
activities, there were prizes,
food, clowns, mascots such as
Chuck E. Cheese and the Pirate
Parrot, and even puppet shows
and sing-alongs done in sign lan-
guage.

about. It’s really great.”

Gary Mulé, who also served as
a clown, said they can make up
their own names to put on their
name tags to make it more fun
for the kids. -

“We take the kids back to the
rooms so they can meet their
one-on-ones,” Mulé said. “Other
than that, we take pictures and
act goofy.”

When each one—on—one volun-
teer signs up, they have the
option of the type of child with
which they wish to work.

“The rooms represent the
degree of the physical and/or
mental disability,” said Bryan
Blanchard, a senior staff member
of Hand-in-Hand and a third-
year nursing student at Pitt. “The
blue room is for mild, yellow is
for moderate andired is for a
severe disability.”

He said that ‘each child is
accordingly taken to their room
to meet their one-on-one.

He also said that they have
never had the problem of the
children being apprehensive
toward leaving their parents and
going with a stranger.

“lt’s really a good learning
experience and a lot of fun,” he
said.

“We have three coordinators
— myself, Jen Bowman and
Hannah Uffberg,” said Pitt senior
Sharmon Kramer, coordinator of
activities, booths and clowns,
decorations and public relations
for the festival. “The three of us
started probably in August get-
ting things together,” she said.

“The point of [the festival] is
to bring the handicapped com-
munity together with the student
community,” she said.

“Everything is student volun-
teered, it’s really wonderful,”
said Hannah Uffberg, a coordi-
nator in charge of the facilitators
and the medical and food com-
mittees.

“The average age [of the chil-
dren] is 12, but it reaches from
three to 18 or 19,” she said.

it or lose it” basis. Any of the meals not eaten by
the end of the week are lost. The new plan calls for
an increase in pricing, but according to Sallade-
Farina, that increase is inevitable no matter what
plan is utilized.

“There is going to be a substantial increase in
pricing, regardless of what meal plan there is,” said
Sallade-Farina.

She stated the meal plan system “must break
even, and currently it is not doing so.” i

“We spent $5 million in renovations, and we
built Eddie’s Cafeteria with money we really didn’t
have,” Sallade-Farina stated.

In addition, the university would implement a
new program called Maniott Dollars, which close-
ly resembles the current Choice Dollar system. The
student is given a balance, and the amount of each
purchase is deducted from this balance as the
semester goes on. The Marriott Dollars would
allow students to buy items from any Marriott-
operated cafeteria or retail outlet on campus. Any
Marriott Dollars not used by the end of the semes-
ter are lost.

This new system was met with open hostility
from students. Many in the audience strongly
voiced their approval of the current system and

asked the Food Service Committee not to scrap the
BLOCK Meal Plan. _,

“You’ve got over 90 percent usage. Why change
the system? Adjust it; it’s obviously working,” said
Capriotti.

Members of the Student Government Board
questioned the Comrnittee’s motives for changing
the BLOCK meal plan.

“The problem is, when you say it’s not working
[the current meal plan], you don’t mean it’s not
working for the students, youmean it’s not work-
ing for Marriott,” Capriotti stated. “It’s not our
responsibility to make up for the losses and ill-
preparation that Marriott has done.”

Last year Marriott lost money from the meal plan
system. However, Jim Jenkins, general manager of
Maniott, said Marriott was at fault for the loss.

“We over-anticipated the cost that the use or con-
sumption would get where it was. That was a mis-
take on our part,” said Jenkins. “The BLOCK Meal
Plan, to a certain extent, was misunderstood.”

The Food Service Committee plans on keeping
the current BLOCK Meal Plan in effect, but with
minor adjustments.

“I’m more than happy to continue the BLOCK
Plan. I hear that loud and clear now,” Sallade-
Farina stated.

One—on-one Tom Lotito was
very excited about the new
friend he made in his young
companion, Michael Perret.

“I really wanted to do this,”
said Lotito. “I felt bad.” '

“I see him having such a good
time and it makes it so worth it,”
he said. ‘The smile hasn’t left his
face or mine all day.”

The one—on—one volunteers
were not the only ones having
fun at the festival.,The workers
at the booths also found the
experience very fulﬁlling.

“It’s nice working at a booth

because you get to see all the
kids since almost all of them stop
by,” said Bonnie.Lata, a fifth-
year occupational therapy major.
“You’re exposed to a variety
of kids instead of being paired up
with just one all day,”- she said.
The major contributors from
the university were Student
Government Board and the
Office of Residence Life.
Marriott Food Service was the
primary food sponsor along with
help from Domino’s, Thrift
Drug, Kunst and Jenny Lee
Bakeries and Giant Eagle.

There will also be an open microphone there for 15 minutes
for anyone who wants to stand up and tell her story about a per-
sonal experience with sexual violence.

The march will then proceed through the Camegie-Mellon fra-
ternity complex to North Oakland and circle Pitt’s fraternities.

It will then go by the Oakland bars and the Towers and end up
at the William Pitt Union patio, where there will be three speak-
ers and another open microphone for as long as people want to

speak.

“We encourage people to tell their personal stories with vio-
lence,” said Scott Dolin, co-president of CWO.

Chath_am College and Camegie-Mellon University will also be
participating in the march. Along with these other universities,
there will be several other student groups involved in themarch,
including the SGB, University Democrats, Student
Environmental Action Coalition, Circle K and BiGALA.

There will be many reminders throughout the march and at the
William Pitt Union that this is about women who have been

affected by sexual violence.

The T-shirts are just the beginning. There will also be posters
—- some in the shape of tombstones, with the names of women
who have died in Pennsylvania in 1994 due to domestic vio-
lence. Next to the T-shirts will be chicken wire tied with blue rib-
bons in memory of survivors of violence.

The march will take approximately 45 minutes, and there may
be a band before the march begins at Camegie-Mellon.

Goose-step into the future

It appears the goose-steppers are on the march once again. In this
country there are those who would like to register certain groups in
order to keep tabs on them.

In a report on the front page of USA Today, is a brief description
of a bill which seeks to force homosexuals who are convicted of
sodomy to undergo registration so that they will have to register
with local law‘ enforcement agencies for life. There are laws against
sodomy in 24 states. Sodomy includes, but is not limited to, homo-
sexual sex. Will those heterosexual couples who engage in sodomy
also have to register themselves with local police for the rest of
their lives in Montana? ,

The measure already passed the Montana State Senate, and the
House is now working on its provision of the bill. An amendment
to exclude this from the registration bill was defeated in committee.
Deviant sexual behavior is outlawed in Montana, but this law is
rarely prosecuted. The potential for increased enforcement of the
law after the registration measures are in place, however, should
make everyone leery of such a move.

This is part of a neo-Victorian backlash in this country in which a
minority seeks to impose its views on the majority. Those elected
officials in office now do not speak for a majority in this country. In
such a large and diverse nation, it is difficult to get a majority on
anything. It is this very fact whichprevents dictatorship.

This maneuver is similar to those used by Nazi Germany to regis-
ter those whom they considered undesirables. This comparison is
often considered cliche, but that is because it is used whenever the
government picks a new enemy of the month. Saddam Hussein and
Kim Il Sung wereboth compared to Hitler when they seemed to
pose a threat. When real genocidal atrocities take place, however,
they are quietly swept under the rug.

“Never again,” the world said after the atrocities of World War H
came to light. Yet when the time came in Cambodia with Pol Pot, in
the Soviet Union with Stalin wiping out the Kulaks or in Bosnia
with the atrocities against the Muslims, this country was unwilling
to stand up and be counted.

While most Americans could assuage their consciences with the

' idea that these things were someone-else’s problem, this registration

drive for various members of our society based on someone’s con-
cept of morality is our problem. If criminals are so dangerous that
they need to be registered so that law enforcement knows where
they are, then they ought not have been let out of prison in the ﬁrst

place. This is a sign that our criminal justice system is not working. ‘

Homosexuals are the next group on the list. Who’s next? What is
the next group society will view as something we must eliminate?

The trend toward authoritarianism is unAmerican and must be
opposed at all levels. Otherwise, the government will use the dis-
cretionary rule to break down doors in the middle of the night to
carry off homosexuals and other undesirables or useless eaters.
These laws are already on the books. It is only a matter of time
before others are locked up and marginalized and we are all march-
ing in goose-‘step.

Regardless of your side,

y mom is the queen
of centrism. I talk to
her when I feel like

I’m believing somebody’s
hype and going off the deep
end of whatever ultra-neo-radi-
cal ﬂavor of the month I might
be lapping up at the time. Over
break I told her that the
Christian Coalition, the conser-
vative right and the Contract
With America made me think
of fascism, authoritarianism

_ and little men with little sharp
horns and little red capes cack-

ling over a bubbling couldron
called “The Future of the

United States, just the way we

like it.”

I asked her if she thought I
was being reactionary. Mrs.
Centrism said no.

I do not purport to be any
sort of political analyst, but
since the
Congressional elections, I’ve
mentally collected little pieces
of information on what the
government is up to, and I am
getting alarmed.

Some people think I’m over-
reacting -and overlooking most
of the big picture. I admit that I
don’t have nearly all the facts,
but judging from what I do
know, I probably already
would have moved to New
Zealand if I knew everything.
Also, I honestly do see the
logic behind many of the
government’s actions.
Gradually raise the retirement
age and ..hopefully relieve some
of the enormous strain to pro-
vide social security for a gen-
eration bigger than our own:
OK, I can understand how that
would look good on paper.
“Reform” welfare so that
groups most widely recognized
as taking the unfair advantage
of it can no longer do so:
seems fair enough (although
I’d love to inspect the data pol-
icy makers are basing their
policy on). Reduce spending
on school lunches and other
anti-poverty and education
programs for children because
these are the responsibility of
the parents: that sounds logi-
cal, too. (The Family Values

mid-term’

people are dancing on tables
right about now.)

But what about when parents
run out of lunch money for
their children because the gov-
ernment 'cut their welfare
checks? What about cuts to
college loans that many stu-
dents and parents depend on?
And if we’re trying so hard to
tighten our belts for the sake of
lowering the deficit and fixing
this huge financial mess we’re
in, how much sense does it
make to give more tax breaks
to big corporations? Isn’t that
the same trickle-down pipe
dream that we haven’t quite
forgotten yet?

The Bill of Rights is like the
Ten Commandments. Pro or
con, they were put there for a
reason. Congress’ recent

‘attempt to tamper with the

Fourth Amendment’s search

“Hand seizure laws through the

discretionary rule in the Crime

"”'Bi':ll, while it is a (presumably)

sincere effort to improve the
justice system, smacks of
something I don’t want to get ‘
smacked with.

Nationalism must be
watched with a suspicious eye,
and I have mine on the move
to make English the official
language. While cutting
through negligible government
overhead, potential effects
include eliminating bilingual
education for already margin-
alized groups, English-only in
voting booths and documents,
and — say supporters — lots
of the warm, fuzzy national .
pride you get when you con-
quer the Tower of Babel.

While assimilation is fine
and good for the people who
think it’s fine and good, it’s
hard enough to pay taxes in
your native tongue, much less
in a foreign one.

I got a cold, paralyzed feel-
ing when I heard that the first
thing the new Congress_did
was fire the White House
Historian. I felt it again hearing
about funding cuts for public
radio and the National
Endowment for the Arts. I was
getting numb by the time a

get the facts

friend of mine got a call from a‘

friend who depends on the
Perkins Loan to stay in school.
Sobbing, she told him that
since the loan was being cut,
so might she.

It is logical for an authoritar-
ian government first to silence

the voices that oppose it. So I .

think that cold feeling is at
least somewhat justified when
our leaders first decide to
rewrite history, then decide not
to support the Other Side of the

story and finally start chipping '

away at higher education:

As secure as we feel in this
fortress of democracy, it could
come down at any moment.
“Nah, can’t happen,” you say,
like the proverbial teenager
who thinks she’s immortal. It
has and it can. Whole countries

have fallen under the thumb of ’

dangerous leaders before they
knew what had hit them. The
changes going on now are hap-
pening so quickly that it is easy
not to notice and almost
impossible to keep up.
Fortunately, we can do more
than watch ourselves getswal-
lowed up in the pages of histo-

ry as they flip by on the

evening news. Find out for
yourself what is going on.
Then, keep democracy yours.
Tell the people that represent
you how they should do it, and
if they screw it up, make sure
you fire them in the next elec-
tion.

Read the Contract with
America. Then go to a protest
against the Contract to be held
in conjunction with protests
nationwide this Wednesday at
noon on the William Pitt Union
lawn. Contact Carol Stabile at
441-9207 for information.

Whatever side_ you’re on, or
if you haven’t chosen one yet,
go, get some facts and listen to
some opinions you might not
hear otherwise. And please,
don’t believe the hype.

coach
Jim Boheim
boasts an
incredible suc-
cess rate for
his players

Duncan the next level.

Just in the last
10 years, Boheim has sent
Derrick Coleman, Billy
Owens, Sherman Douglas,
Dwayne “Pearl” Washington,
Rony Seikaly, Rafael
Addison, Dave Johnson and
LeRon Ellis to the NBA. Most
of them were first round

picks, if not lottery selections.

. Several otherswere drafted”, A

11 to be exact, since 1986.

And in June, Syracuse’s and
the Big East’s leading scorer,
Lawrence Moten, will be a
sure—fire first-round pick in
the draft.

So there’s no question
Boheim knows how to recruit
talented players and prepare
them for the NBA. ,

However, Boheim is a little
less schooled when it comes
to that not-so-important sub-
ject of education. In fact, he’s
down-right pathetic.

Boheim’s graduation rate of
his vaunted basketball pro-
gram is 18 percent. That’s ‘
right, 18 percent of the
Orangemen players actually
get their college degree, and
that’s counting the scrubs on
the end of the bench.

This graduation rate covers
a four-year period of entering
first-year students from 1984-
1985 through ‘87-’88. All stu-
dents have been given a. six-
year period in which to
receive their degree.

Apparently, all Boheim’s
grade fudging and payoffs
have caught up with him, as
the NCAA finally nailed '
‘Cuse in ‘92 for various rules
infractions. Syracuse’s proba-
tion was just lifted this year.

It’s documented that
Boheim graduates more.play-
ers to the pros than actually
graduate.

But Syracuse isn’t the only
school that has its share of
problems graduating players
and following NCAA guide-
lines. ’

Oklahoma State’s coach
Eddie Sutton, notorious for
consistently running crooked
programs, once again has his

For the ﬁrst time in four years,
the Fitzgerald Field House
opened its doors to host Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
Women’s_ Gymnastic
Championships last Friday night.
When the chalk dust cleared, the
Lady Panthers found themselves
holding several new school
records.

“Thisiis probably the most
rewarding experience I’ve had
with the team here,” said coach

Debbie Yohman. “They really

worked hard, and they really had
a nice meet.” ‘ .

Pitt set a new team record with
a score of l89.35.35 to finish
fourth in the seven—team field
behind first place Towson State
(l94.075), New Hampshire

'(l9l.225) and James Madison

(l89.625). Fifth place went~to

William and Mary (187.05), and «

Yale, (186.7-75) and Northeastern
(l84.625) rounded out the ﬁeld.

“We hit almost everything,” V:

said sophomore'Robyn Senior.
“We only counted one or two
falls, that’s it.”

Leading the Lady Panthers
was Senior, who took third in the
all-around competition with a
career high 38.375. Her score
was also good enough for sec-
ond on Pitt’s all-time list.

 ‘.‘I really wanted to finish in

the top six, but I never expected
that,” Senior said oflher third-
place performance.

Baseball scouts are said to
be excellent judges of talent.
In as short a time-as one
game, they can tell you who
has a future in organized

baseball and who doesn’t.

Jason Conti doesn’t agree.
He’ll tell you that they do
miss some players. He
knows, because he was one
of those players that every-
body, except Pitt, missed.

Conti, the Panthers’ sopho-
more centerfielder, is indeed
the true definition of the
phrase “diamond in the
rough?‘

Before this weekend, he
was batting a sizzling .382
with l2 RBI and 10 stolen
bases, while starting all of
Pitt’s games. '

Not bad for a guy who was
not at the top of many‘ coach-
es’ wish lists coming out of

him primarily for his speed.

Conti has proven them all
wrong. A batting average
hovering- around .380 proves
that he is more than just a
base stealer.

He has been a perfect fit
and a pleasant surprise for
the Panthers.

“He’s asmart player. He
uses the way that he is
defended to his advantage,”
first baseman Rob Garvey
said. “He’ll bunt down the_
third—base line and get a hit.
By his next at bat, the third
baseman has moved up, and
then he’ll slap it by him.”

Jackson calls him, “the
prototypical player” for Pitt’s

offensive scheme, which is

geared‘ toward running.

“In our system, they want
me to steal bases and bunt, “.
Conti said. “It’s worked out
real well, because these are
pretty much the strengths of
my game.” ' ‘

“Speed is something that is
never in a slump,” Jackson
said. “I’d like to have nine
guys who could run and hit
like Jason.”

Conti has also become
solid in the field.

over a stagnant program and
made it into a national power '
— there’s a statistic tucked
away in the Oklahoma State
archives that’s a little more
eye-popping.

It’s hard to fathom, but
Oklahoma State only gradu-
ates 7 percent of its players.
While Sutton isn’t fully to
blame for the school’s diploma
woes, he sure hasn’t done any-
thing to try to correct the situa-
tion. _

At the time, Sutton was too
busy delivering the death
penalty to Kentucky. After
leading Kentucky into proba-
tion from ‘89 to ‘92 for a mul-
titude of violations, Sutton
fled to Oklahoma State.

Although Sutton is a winner,
his seedy past of nabbing
junior college players and then
dropping them is sure to catch
up to him in the Big Country.

Hanging juco players out to
dry seems to be a popular tac-
tic in the Big Eight
Conference. Long—time

Missouri coach Norm Stewart
has also built his winning tra-
dition around juco players.

But again, that tactic suc-
ceeds on the hardwood but
fails in the classroom. While
Mizzou’s graduation rate is a
tad higher at 38 percent, the
Tigers have failed to graduate
a black player within the allot-
ted years.

And with poor graduation
rates, NCAA violations always
seem to follow. Missouri was
last on probation in ‘90—’92.

Poor graduation rates are a
popular trend in the Big Eight.
Oklahoma holds an 18 percent
rate, and the national power
Kansas Jayhawk program
hands out diplomas to 29 per-
cent of its players.

After crying about national
recognition, Nolan Richardson

Arkansas Razorbacks might

ation rate.

grad rate is North Carolina.
Dean Smith has run a sterling
ship in his tenure, but would
he be as successful if he didn’t
drastically drop the entering
Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores? ' ’

Granted, every school low-
ers its standards for scholar-
athletes, but UNC, known as a
cerebral school, stretches it a
bit. The median SAT score for
entering students is 1,118, but
for basketball players it’s at
787.

Pitt looks like a graduation
haven compared to a lot of
programs. The Panthers gradu-
ate 53 percent of their hoop-

sters — not quite a staggering
rate, but it’s a definite
improvement from most of the
Top 25 programs.

The big bucks dominate col-
lege basketball now, and the
only way to cash in on the
huge television contracts,
sponsors and the post-season
green is to win.

While most of the blame
falls on the coaches’ shoul-
ders, it’s not all their fault.
They are shackled. Shackled
by the athletic department to
win, and if they don’t, they’re
gone. It’s that cut and dry. I
How many coaches have hung
around just because of their

high grad rate? Not many, if
any.

Coaches are forced to cut
corners, give under-the-table
payments and ignore gradua-
tion rates. It’s their livelihood.
If one coach doesn’t do it,
another one will.

Only a select few can have
both a winning program and
graduate their players -— like
Bobby Knight, Coach K and
Smith. But that status can only
be attained if the school is able
to rest on its winning tradition.

Good luck Ralph Willard.

overall.

UNH’s Megan Ochs was ﬁrst
individually with a near—perfect
score of 9.95. She helped to lead
UNH to second place with
48.375. Sariy Lehmuskal of
Towson was close behind with a
9.9. Towson was first in the
event with a 48.925.

The Lady Panthers started the
meet on the right foot by posting
a 47.325 on the ﬂoor. Senior had
Pitt’s highest score,‘ a 9.675. She
was followed by Stevens and
Calli Bodnar, who both scored
9.45.

UNH was ﬁrst with a 48.225,
led by Reardon’s first—place
mark of 9.8.

“I told the kids we had the
best rotation we could possibly
have,” Yohman said. “The ﬁrst
event [ﬂoor] was our third—best
event, so we started on our third-
best event, went to vault which

. we set a school record on

tonight —— had a little problem
on bars and finished on our best
event. We rocked on beam.”

Pitt totaled a 48.15 on the
beam, its last event, led by
Stevens’ 9.725. She was fol-
lowed by Myers (9.7) and Lori
Buck (9.675). Deena Daller and
Senior both had 9.5.

“Beam is a very hard event to_
ﬁnish on because you get to the
end and one fall’s going to move
you down in the meet,” Yohman
said. ’

Pitt was second behind
Towson’s 48.825 for team hon-
ors. Lehmuskal took first indi-
vidually for the Tigers with a
9.85.

The third rotation matched the
Lady Panthers with the uneven
bars, where they struggled.
Their 45.75 was good enough
for ﬁfth place, while Senior had
a 9.35 for the team high. ‘

Towson was No. 1 again,
leading with a 48.150. Yale’s
Anna Mitescu took individual
honors with a 9.75.

“We had a goal that we were
going to come in and have the
best meet we’ve had all year —
that ECACS was our meet and
that was the meet we were
shooting for,” said Yohman.
“For the people that were in the
meet, it couldn’t have been bet-
ter.”

The team will ﬁnd out today
whether or not it qualified for
regionals, which will be in two
weeks.

“We wanted to get a really
high score so that our qualifying
score for regionals would be
better,’7 said Stevens. “We deﬁ-
nitely accomplished that.”

And it doesn’t matter if old
records are tossed in the trash
during the process.

gets good jumps on the ball
and throws accurately. He
has improved tremendously
in the outfield.”

Conti said that he is hav-
ing a big season because of
the extra year of experience
that he has under his belt.

“Last year I was a little
nervous and tentative at
times because I was a fresh-
man,” he said. “This year
I’m a little more experienced
and playing with confi-
dencef’

“Most of the time, players
make the biggest improve-
ments between their fresh-
man and sophomore years,”
Jackson said. “This year
Jason is more comfortable.
He now expects to go out
every day and play well.”

Conti will have a chance
this summer to prove just
how far he has come.

He was recently chosen by

one or two of its top players.
This year, as a sophomore,
Conti fits into that category.

“A. few of our guys have
gone out there and done
really well,” Jackson said.
“It’s a league that uses
wooden bats, which is
important for pro scouts to
see. It also gives them a
chance to look at some kids
from the North in good
weather. It’s a good experi-
ence that will definitely help
his career.”

“I can’t wait to go,” Conti
said. “It’s a great opportuni-
ty because someday I would
like to play professionally,
but right now I have this
season to get done.”

But looking beyond this
season, Jackson sees a bright
future for his young center-
fielder.

“He’s not playing as well
as he is capable of,” Jackson
