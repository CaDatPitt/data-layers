SU Forum
To Discuss

Cheating

A Student Union Board

Forum Series program will
pose the question “Why Not
Cheat?” Wednesday at 3
p.m. in the lower lounge of
the Student Union. Dr. Alan
C. Rankin, vice-chancellor of
student and general affairs
will moderate the panel dis-
cussion on academic integ-
rity.
’ Panel members include: Helen
Pool Rush, dean of students; Kar-
en Woolf, president of Mortar
Board; Jay Adlersberg, recently
tapped to Phi Beta Kappa, and a
faculty member yet to be an-
nounced. -

The signiﬁcance of the topic
was explained by Forum Series
chairman, Warren Brennan, who
said: “There is no official Uni-
versity position, on academic in-
tegrity — no clear-cut deﬁnition

of how incidents of cheating will-

be handled. Theepoint of the for-
um is to stress the need for a

change whether it be a change 6

in policy or a change in attitude,
on the part of administration,
faculty, and students.”

Questions

The "panel will attmept to ans-
wer such questions as:

>An education implies excel-
lence, but how ‘is’ this being
achieved and evaluated at the
University?

> Is there a real problem of a
lack of academic integrity in the
student body?

>Is there a lack of concern

among the faculty in their edu- ~

cational philosophy in regard to
their teaching commitments? If
so, why does it exist? Is it in-
herent in the system? If not, what
motivates the students to cheat?
> Is an administrative policy
dictating punitive action needed
or can .an enviromnent or tradi-
tion be created to remove the
students’ motivation to cheat?

The Inter - Collegiate Poetry
Congress Anthology has set No-
vember 23 as the deadline for

Senator Marcia Bernstein, who
proposed the bill at Thursday’s

‘ Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Mos-

By WAYNE CLAREN

V “Behold a Pale Horse” is an artistic
success -but it may not be a commercial
"A success.

-3,: Director Fred Zinne-
' ' mann has allowed him-
self, his cast and his
cameramen every
chance to express. hu-
man pathos and desire
realistically and in-
tensely. This is especial-
ly worthy in a story

tation to be ﬁlmed in
the more commercial
style of “The Guns of
Navarrone.” This par-

, ticular comparison seems appropriate because the

subject matter of the two ﬁlms is similar and
because Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn star
in both cases.

“Behold a Pale Horse,” unlike the earlier ﬁlm,
keeps action at a minimum and places its em-
phasis on the individual characters and their

_personal plight, rather than on the details of the
plot or the excitement of a battle.

Indeed, a great deal of concentration is need-
ed in order to follow the plot and to understand
the minds of the characters. The story is told in
pictures more than words. Sometimes the still-

» ness and silence are too intense; often the events
are much less interesting than had been antici-
‘pated. So it is in life.

- . Events Pass Slowly

Anyone seeking lots of suspense and shooting
will be disappointed. The events pass slowly,

which held great temp- S

. sometimes too slowly, and when the climax oc-

curs it is with brief action and little glory.

Each character ﬁnds his identity and even
attains his goal, but only to discover his iden-
tity, as well as the goal, were not so signiﬁcant
after all—again as it often is in life.

The picture is ﬁlmed in what has come to be
known as the “European” or_ “art” technique.
The camera shows each scene with newsreel-like
realism which is appropriate to the ﬁlms theme.

Triumph of Meaning

The real triumph of the picture—in its mean-
ing and its style—is manifested through its sim-
plicity. Satisfaction for the viewer is found not
in deeply emotional hopes and elaborately plan-
ned adventures, but in a simple gift, a passing
smile. .

A heavy burden is placed on the cast since
it is really in their eyes and thoughts that
signiﬁcance must appear. They measure up to
thevtask. Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, Omar
Sharif (of Lawrence of Arabia) and a fine sup-
porting "cast splendidly portray torn and be-
wildered individuals.

Though the story takes place near the present
time, its roots are in the Spanish Civil War. It
is necessary to keep in mind the emotions and
the results of that event: the defeat of the pop-
ular Republican Government by the Fascists, the
hatred which many Spaniards felt towards the
military and the church, the years of death and
torture which Spain endured while an apathetic
world looked on.

Passions are 20 years old, tired and burning
low when “Behold a Pale Horse” begins. How
they are revived, only to ﬂicker out, is the story
the movie tells. It does so in stark and crudely
enchanting fashion. ' -

Democrat Garrett
Urges Female Interest

By VICKI EPSTEIN
Mrs. Molly Yard Garrett, Democratic candidate for

Pennsylvania’s General Assembly, exhorted women to
“throw your hats in the ring” at a small gathering last
Thursday for the YWCA lecture series.

' In the past, “political careers have not been a part of
women’s role in life——except for licking envelopes.” Women
of today. however, should assert equal rights to a political
life, she stressed. Her lecture was the second in the series
on “The Role of Women in Our Society.” '

Two careers are open to all women, according to Mrs.
Garrett. They are the life of a

housewife and the life of a busi-
ness employee. Mrs. Garrett sug-
gested that women enter politics
to ease men's jobs as politicians
and as bread-winners for their
families.
‘Education Necessary

Mrs. Garrett rates education as
the single most important object
of legislation, especially in the
state General Assembly. Educated
women should become active in
the political ﬁeld, she contends.
_ No woman should waste her
talents after her children have
grown up, "but should turn to
political life, she advised. A
mother of three children, Mrs.
Garrett herself returned to poli-
tics after raising her family.

Mrs. Garrett is a graduate of
Swarthmore College. She has
worked for better education in
large cities, and has been active
in the National Association for

the Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple. She helped with the 1963
March on Washington, and has

worked with United States Sena-
tor Joseph Clark.

  The Other Side

1 On the front page of the September 30 issue of The

‘Pittsburgh Press, a “news” article covering Senator Gold-
.. water’s campaign appeared with the headline, ‘Barry
‘Echoes McCarthy Theme.”

In this report, Scripps-Howard staff writer Dickson
Preston stated that Goldwater “has raised the ghost of

' Joe McCarthy” in his search for votes in Ohio-

He continued with the state-
ment that “the Republican nomi-
nee “sounded a favorite McCarthy
theme” by accusing the Johnson
administration of being “soft on
Communism.” Preston also des-
cribed the senator's speaking style
as resembling McCarthy’s and
compared some of Goldwater’s ac-
tions with those of the late Wis-
consin senator. Preston seemed
to imply that Goldwater was Mc-
Carthy revisited.

' THIS ARTICLE was passed
D’Ippolito off for factual, objective and ac-
curate reporting of the campaign. Since it did not appear
on the editorial page the reporting also assumed to to be

    

A - unbiased.

If _this same "style was used on President Johnson’s
ca.mpa1gn this is what the coverage would be like:

ALONG THE WAY WITH LBJ, Oct. 12—President
Lyndon Johnson has raised the ghost of Nevil Chamberlain

‘ in ‘his search for Iowa's nine electoral votes.

THE PRESIDENT sounded a favorite Chamberlain
theme in Des Moines yesterday when, speaking on for-

: j eign policy, he said that our politics “must seek to widen

our common agreement, not to inflame our mutual mis-
trust.

That is the same message the late prime minister of
Great Britain delivered to his people when he returned
from Munich in 1938 after ﬁnding areas of common agree-
ment with Hitler, thereby securing “peace in our time.”

HIS REMARKS reminded one of Woodrow Wilson’s,
“He kept us out of war” slogan in Wilson's bid for re-
election in 1916. Wilson, campaigning only one year be-
fore the United States entry into World War I, also
appealed for votes on his record of maintaining the
peace. ‘

From Des Moines the President thrust his campaign
into Iowa City last night where he rejected charges that
“America's missiles are unreliable.”

The President’s remark was reminiscent of 1919 when
Franklin Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy,

; criticized Billy Mitche1l’s proposal to build a strong air

force instead of relying on large battleships.
Mitchell charged “that we are behind all other na-
tions in aviation.” Goldwater has charged that our mis-

\' ‘siles have not been tested under battle conditions, are
not as versatile as manned bombers, and hence may put

us behind Russia in overall strength-
President Johnson cited figures from Secretary of

' Defense Robert McNamara, a civili'an, to rebuke the sen-

ators’ charge: just as ﬁgures from Assistant Secretary
of the Navy Roosevelt, also a civilian, were used against
Brigadier General Mitchell.

Goldwater, the President accused, has only military
; ‘men on his side. ‘ ~ .

a more advanced course for the present
80’s or 180's introductorypcourses.

Liberal arts students must take ﬁive
courses in ﬁve different fields, in the
divisions of the humanities, social sci-
ences and sciences. The avowed purpose
of this program is to make sure that
liberal arts graduates get a liberal or
broad education to make sure that each
student becomes familiar with the vari-
ety of academic disciplines. “

I am not attacking this system. On
balance the arguments for it outtweigh
those against it. Unfortunately, however,
the program has become intertwined with
introductory courses.

IN ORDER FOR a student to get
credits for distribution he must take an
80’s course if he is a freshman or sopho-
more or a 180’s course if he is junior or
senior. As the rules stand now, it is im-
possible to substitute a more advanced
course for distribution credit.

I needed three more credits in the
social sciences for distribution credit. I
signed up for economics 180 this fall. I
planned to take two ‘more economics
courses in the winter- When I went to
class, however, I discovered that the 180
course ‘was designed for students who
didn’t plan on taking any more econom-

ics. Therefore the professor emphasized
concepts rather than methology. '
After three years of history and po-
litical science I was already quite con-
versant with economic concepts. On the
other hand I know practically nothing
of the methodology. In addition in order
to take more advanced courses a fami'li-
arity with methodology or Econ 11 and
12 is a prerequisite. Hence Econ 180
would have been a waste of time for me.

THE PROFESSOR in Econ 180 and
the head of the Economics Department
suggested that I drop 180 and take 11.
So there seemed to be no problem. I
soon learned better.

One of the liberal arts advisors told
me that I would not be given distribu-
tion credit for Econ 11. After a futile
attempt to reason with her, I saw Dean
Dixon who told me that same thing.

There was no question of getting dis-
tribution credit for two courses in one
ﬁeld. Thus the broadness of my educa-
tion was not at issue. The question was:
Could I get credit for Econ 11 as a sub-
stitute for 180? ‘The answer was: No!’
They would have given me credit for
Econ 180 which would have added little
or nothing to my education. But they
would not give me credit for distribu-
tion for Econ 11. Why? Because Econ
11 is neither an 80 nor a 180 course.

Such rules belong in impersonal beau-
racracies, not in a University. These rules
must be changed.

   

 

Reader Calls
Goldwaterites
Rowdy Group

Editor, The Pitt News:

In this year’s presidential elec-
tion one can easily tell which
candidate a group supports by
the actions of that group. This
was certainly the case last Satur-
day after the Goldwater rally at
Pitt.

Rowdy groups of young people
were roaming around Forbes Av-
enue like gangs, others were
shouting from bus windows and
all waved placards and carried
what looked like empty beer cans
with the words “Gold Water”
printed on them.

‘At least from the actions of
their holders I was led to believe
that they were beer cans, and
that they had been rendered
quite empty. One of the placards
bore the name “Goldwater” and
a picture of the Republican ele-
phant. Whether there was meant
to be any association, I’m not
sure.

What came to mind was the
"startling similarity between the
actions of these young Goldwa-
terites and their candidate. It’s
bad enough that the young peo-
ple whom Goldwater has labeled
“subversives” should" even sup-
port this man, but must they
live up, or down, to this name.

May I suggest that if they wish
to really help their candidate,
they should try to act more un-
like him and more like sensible
college students.

Letters To The Editor

ly Everyone Is,” September 28,
p. 4). If to be dissatisﬁed with the
status quo is extremism, then
many of those whom history has
called great must be counted as
extremists.

I feel, however, that more dis-
tinction should be made between
some of the examples of extrem-
ism D’Ippolito cites. For Senator
Goldwater to advocate giving nu-
clear weapons to a military pow-
er block such as -NATO is a paro-
chial sort of extremism. In con-
trast, Senator Humphrey's pro-
posal to let the UN. take control
of U.S. nuclear power is,in my
opinion, an internationalist sort
of extremism altogether too rare
among senators.

Of course, it is extreme for Sen-
ators,Humphrey and Clark to ad-
vocate disarmament. At least it
sounds so to self-satisﬁed Amer-
icans from grabbing their materi-
.al “goodies.” But this kind of
farseeing extremism recognizes
at least in part that the world
has become a small community,
in the geographical sense,_ and
the present unfair distributions
of material wealth cannot for-
ever be maintained.

In contrast, I too fail to see
the distinction made by the Wash-
ington Post between Goldwater’s
suggestion to strike supply lines
and Johnson’s decision to attack
North Vietnamese bases. Both ap-
pear to me as examples of na-
tionalist extremism. As a sena-
tor and as president, Mr. Johnson
has become known as one who
gets things done by reconciling
opposition groups. If this is a
good method in domestic politics,
he ought to use it abroad.

Mortar Board
Not Asked About
Budget Change

Editor, The Pitt News:

  letter is ’ prompted in re-

 

       
 

 

sponse to an article that appear-
ed in The Pitt News of Friday,
October 2, 1964, entitled “Univer-

sity -Wide Events Deﬁned.” In ‘A

part the article deals with the
fact that Mortar Board has lost
its appropriation from the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. The exact
wording is as follows: “Mortar
Board and Cwens agreed to forgo
their appropriations in line with

the Committee's suggestion that I

no honorary group come under
the Student Affairs budget.”

I cannot speak for Cwens, but
as President of Mortar Board I
can say that neither I nor the
treasurer of our organization was
consulted before this action was
taken. My knowledge comes from
the article itself.

I do not quibble with the fact
that Mortar Board has lost its
appropriation. I do, however, re-
sent that the organization was
not notiﬁed beforehand. Further-
more such action implies that cer-
tain administrators and certain
members of the SG senate have
assumed the responsibility of
thinking for Mortar Board, with
which they have no formal affili-
ation.

Mortar Board is an indepen-
dent‘ organization composed of re-
sponsible women who are cap-
able of making their own deci-
sions. In the future, I hope that
it will be notiﬁed of all actions
that will affect it in any way.

A Cross - Country Team Rips

State; Takes Top 3 Places

The cross- country team
continued its drive toward
an undefeated season with a
19-36 win over Penn State
Saturday morning on Flag-
staff Hill.

John Bailey, Damien Koch and
Dave Eichenlaub tied for ﬁrst in
the runners ﬁrst victory against
the Lions in 10 years. Rounding

out the scorers for the Panthers
were sophomores Fran Shor, sixth,
‘and Frank Handleman, seventh.

Placing for State were Joe

Swanson, Tom Leuthold, Dick

Lampman, Ron Morris and R01-

and Rose. Practically the same

team had upended the Pan-

thers, 19-41, last year.

The time for the four and a

quarter mile course was 22:26.7.

“Those boys were great out
there,” coach Jim Banner said

after the meet. Banner walked

with his head high and .a broad -

smile on his face. He had a right
to hold his head up. His team is
the only one undefeated in var-
sity competition.

  Frosh Quarterback’s Daring

Sparks Team to 8-7 Victory

By TOM SACKS

MORGAN TOWN, W. VA.

Freshman football team quarter-

-back Bob Bazylak completed a daring fourth-down-and-long
yardage pass here Friday to spark the Cubs to a come from
behind 8-7 victory over West Virginia’s Little Mountaineers.

At the tail end of a 7-0 score with less than seven min-

utes to play in the game, the
freshmen had apparently been
stopped with .a fourth down and
eight yards to go situation on the
50 yard line after having driven
42 yards from their eight. Bazylak,
however, who completed 12 of 19
passes during the game, com-
pleted a pass to end Rich Miale
for a ﬁrst down on the West Vir-
ginia 36 yard line.

The touchdown came on the
next play when Bazylak passed
36 yards to Bob Longo. On the
try for the extra-point, Bazylak
rolled to his left threw to Nliale
in the end zone, gaining the
margin of victory.

The 92 yard drive in 12 plays
consumed roughly six minutes.
Leading ground gainer on the
series was fullback Joe Jones
with 16 yards on four carries.

The lone Little Mountaineer
touchdown came in the third
quarter following a fumble re-
covery on the mid-ﬁeld stripe by
Jim Jackson. Thirteen plays later,

score. Dave Lavella kicked the
Chuck Lovinski passed seven
yards to Doug Carter for the
extra point.

Perhaps the game’s turning
point, however, was when the
Cubs stopped the Mounties on
the Cub one yard line late in
the ﬁrst half. After intercept-
ing a Bazylak pass on their 33,
the Little Mountaineers drove
to the Pitt eight yard line, gain-
ing a ﬁrst down. Four plays
later and with only one min-
ute remaining, the Cubs took
over possession on their one
yard after Marc Mallinger and
David Raudman had stopped
Garrett Ford’s fullback plunge.

Th Cubs total offense eclipsed
that of West Virginia by nearly
100 yards, 257-155. Heading the
ground gainers for Pitt was Bill
Boucek with 39 yards. Longo’s
four catches netted him 71 yards.

Dick Lampman, one of State’s
strongest runners last year,
managed only an eighth place
in the meet.

Now 4-0, the cross - country
team has only two meets left be-
fore the IC4A cross-country meet
in New York. The harriers travel
to Columbus this weekend for a
meet with Ohio State. Two weeks
after that meet they travel to
Morgantown, West Virginia, for
an encounter with‘ West Virginia
University's runners.

W V U Offense Fails

To Move Football

3}’ BOB SMIZIK
West Virginia’s football team gave a highly-uninspired
performance Saturday at the Stadium and the reason, ac-
cording to Mountaineer coach Gene Corum was a simple
one. “We just weren't up for this Pitt game like we have
been in the past,” said Corum. The Panthers shut-out West

Virginia, 14-0.

Corum went on to explain,
“Our boys point to this game
every year, but last week we
played a real tough game against
Rice and that game just took too
much out of us. We might have
got high if we got off to a good
start, but it was Pitt who got off
to the good start.”

The Mountaineers, displaying
the least potent attack the Pan-
thers have faced in the past two
years, failed to cross the Panther
35-yard line during the game and
were held to nine ﬁrst downs.

This could merely speak well

for the Panther defense, but
Corum was not inclined to
think so. “I don’t want to take
anything away from their de-
fense,” Corum said, “but our
offense has been a disappoint-
ment to us this season.”

Panther coach John Michelosén
saw the game somewhat differ-
ently. He said, “Overall our de-
fense came through real well.
Schottenheimer (Marty) and

"Popp (Ray) did .a real good job.
But it was a unit effort for us
today.” .

Michelosen also disagreed with
Corum on the emotional status
of the West Virginia team. “Their
greatest effort always comes
against us,” the Panther coach
said. “This is the ‘highest they’ve
been all season and they’ll never
be this high again this season.”

On this point no one could dif-
fer with Michelosen. For the ﬁrst
time this season the opposition
“out -mistaked” the Panthers.
“Some of those mistakes they
made on their own, but a lot of
them we forced them into.”

Season Mark Now 3-1

The most obvious West Virginia
mistakes included three fumbles
recovered by the Panthers and
the same number of interceptions
picked off by Pitt defenders.

The most alert of the Panther
defenders was second unit full-
back Jim Flanigan, who picked
up two West Virginia fumbles
and intercepted one pass. Defen-
sive specialists Marty Schotten-
heimer and Tippy Pohl also in-
tercepted passes and captain Ray
Popp grabbed a third opposition
fumble.

The story of the game unfolded
in the ﬁrst half—-execpt for some
weak offensive or strong defen-
sive play in the second half. The
Panthers scored the ﬁrst time
they had the ball by going 68
yards in 15 plays with Barry Mc-
Knight picking up the bulk of the
yardage by slashing through the
Mountaineer line. Fred Mazurek
scored the touchdown from one

foot out.

The next Panther score came
in the second quarter, ﬁve plays
after Pohl returned a stray pass
to the West Virginia 45, when Ma-
zurek hit Eric Crabtree with a
nine-yard scoring pass.

Despite Mazurek’s hand in both
scoring plays, the Mountaineers
did the best job of stopping the
All-America candidate this sea-
son. He was held to a total offense
of 102 yards, of which only '29
came on the ground.

But while West Virginia could
stop Mazurek they could not start
their offense. Whether the Pan-
ther defense was responsible for
this will be better determined
this Saturday night at Miami,
Florida.

Booters Bounce Mounties, 3-1;
Sharpen Shooting for Howard

By BILL CABIN

Despite careless play, the soccer team de-

, “We had nice plays, and controlled the ball,”

said freshman coach Bob McNulty, "“but our shots
either went at the goalie or over the net.” Paul

-_, ~_~..: .t.._,,—_- -: -—---

feated a ﬁred-up West Virginia squad, 3-1,
Saturday at Forbes Field. While winning, the
booters failed to achieve‘ the ﬁve goal mar-
gin coach Leo Bemis had anticipated.

“We knew we could beat them,” said Bemis,
“and got drawn in as a result. Everytime our cen-
ter-forward would get the ball, our linemen would
come up too soon, and jam up the middle.”

The booters’ scoring was not as effective as it-

was two weeks ago against Ohio University, a
team Bemis rated better than the Mountaineers.

“They were up for the game,” said Bemis, “and
besides, they have improved since last year.

“We were too anxious this week. Usually we
play loose, keep moving, pass the ball, and wait for
a hole to open up. Instead, we came in before the
hole was open, and by the time we had a shot, they
had us covered.”

The booters dominated oﬁensive play for the
second consecutive week. Of the 30 shots taken in
the game, the booters had 80 per cent, outshooting
the Mountaineers’ 24-6.

. ..-.«—-s4»~.n»--,v~-.--.:;:».-: , .. _ ....--_._,.,,.,__  ;.t,_ _ ,. .,... ;

Liberati, former Pitt All-America, agreed “we
control the ball well, and have a lot of shooters,
which is something we lacked when I played.”

Aldo Zortea scored the booters initial goal from
his right wing position, shortly after Butch Rossi
had put the Mounties ahead, 1-0. Dave Reichenbach
scored the second goal later in the ﬁrst half on a
pass from Zortea and head ball by George Shimpino.
Vince Bartalotta scored the ﬁnal goal with less than
ﬁve minutes to play.

Reichenbach now leads the booter’s scoring with
ﬁve goals in four games.

Art Richardson and Ferd Sauer, both sophomores,
turned in good performances. “Art plays his fullback
spot well,” said Bemis. “He’s always on his man
and never sags.” Sauer alternated several plays
with Shimpino at center-forward and Bemis was

pleased with his ﬁrst varsity play at that spot.

The booters travel to Washington, D. C., this
Saturday to face the Howard Bisons, one of the top
teams in the district. “The Way things are shaping
up, there will be _a scramble between Pitt, Penn
State, Howard and West Chester for the NCAA

berth from our district,” said Bemis.

ter two weeks ago, Tavares knew With his strong soccer back- campus

how it felt to lose. ground and the reputation of the

“I’ve been on the losing side Liberty High team» Tavares W35 scene

in basketball and baseball, but
that was the ﬁrst time in soccer,”
he said. “I never had that feel-
ing before on a soccer ﬁeld, and
I really felt bad when the whistle
blew and I knew there was noth-
ing I could do.”

Tavares’ winning habit .began
three years ago when he played
his ﬁrst game at Liberty High
School in Bethlehem where he
was a three year letterman in
basketball and baseball. Liberty
High ran up a string of 50 conse-
cutive undefeated games over a
ﬁve year stretch. Thirty of those
games were won while "Tavares
was a varsity regular.

Last year Tavares started at in-
side right on the undefeated
freshman team.

Although he did not play his
ﬁrst game until high school, Ta-
vares has a strong soccer back-
ground. His father played sandlot
soccer, and several of his uncles
played on an amateur team.

“There was a soccer ﬁeld near
my house and I always used to
watch the amateur teams play
there,” he said. “But my biggest

incentive to play soccer came

a top prospect for college scouts.
He turned down scholarship of-
fers from Muhlenberg, Brown,
and West Chester to attend Pitt.

“Mr. Bemis gave me the best
offer, and’ I wanted to come to

Pitt because it meant a lot of V

prestige to me,” said Tavares.
Tavares was recommended to Be-
mis by Tom Young, a soccer
alumni.

.-Although Tavares is an experi-
enced athlete, and well-versed in
soccer, he admits he’s still learn-
ing. “I played two years at left
wing and one year at center-for-

ward in high school. Last year I

was the ﬁrst time I played .at in-
side right, and I’m still adjust-
ing,” he said. ‘
“Although Tavares is still ad-
justing at the inside position,”
said Bemis, “he’s a good ball han-
dler, has a good‘ hard shot, and
most important, he’s a hustler.”
Tavares’ attitude about the sea-
son seems to typify that of the
team. “I don’t care who the team
is that we play. _I feel if we hus-
tle and play together, that we
can go «all the way,” said Ta-
vares. ~
