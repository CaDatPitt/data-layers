IF Offices Swept
By Panther Party
In Annual Election

By ED BACHMAN

With one swift blow, the
Panther Party took over ex-
ecutive control of the Inter-
fraternity Council. That blow
came in theform of the an-
nual election, held Wednesday
evening at the Sigma Chi
house. _

Succeeding Don Kettering
as president of IF was John
King, Phi Kappa Alpha, who
led his party to a clean sweep of
the near-unaminous balloting.

In addition to King’s election, the
other new officers are: Don Gart-
ner, Phi Epsilon Phi, vice presi-
dent; Larry Miller, Pi Lambda
Phi, secretary; Mal Clemens, Sig-
ma Chi, treasurer; and Dan Le-
vitt, Phi Epsilon Pi, fifth man of
the executive committee.

With only six men eligible for
election, Levitt was the only man
who went through a vote to win
his office. He bestedsJohn Crous-
souloudis, Delta Sigma Phi, ‘of
the Pitt Party, by a 24-18 vote.
Attendance at two-thirds of the

. year’s IF meetings is necessary

—to become eligible for office.’

Tau Delta, was elected as the IF’
representative to.-~~Student Con-
gress.
‘Debate Shelved

Evidence of the Panther Party
controlling power was given dur-
ing debate over a vital issufe. Re-
tiring president Kettering made
the motion for the IF to revert
back to its old delegate strength

“térnity.

This system, abandoned last
year, would bring party‘ control
of IF on a more equal basis. The
present system gives a fraternity
from one to four votes based on
their proportional size.

, System Blasted _

Kettering argued. that the pres-
.-ent system has. done much to
harm IF spirit and inteiyst. The

sufficient spark by individual
fraternities."

Politics Tops Weel§’s Activity 

WSGA Opposed to SC    

On Politics

for Women

_.By NANCY JONES

WSGA Commission decidedwednesday night to appear
in full force at Student Congress this ‘Monday to “enlighten”.
them about integrating women into the political party setup.

-The Commission labeled SC’.s poll of women on their
feelings toward political parties as “not valid,” “inauthenticff

and “false.” ’

LaVerne Dunten raised the question as to whether the
Commission had the right to “sanction women joining politi-
cal parties.” The consensus of opinion seemed to be that “the
....decision should be left to the individual girl.

Patty Goldberg stated that the aims of political parties
for "men and for women are completely different. “l\/Ien,”
she said, “are building and improving their program, and
political parties are a device to get men interested in activi-

belong to the Pitt Party, are given

-.

Party Aims Stated

Three political parties have
been formed and granted oﬁicial
recognition.

The aim and purpose of the
Panther Party is “to combine and
support the best candidate and
to promote responsible student
government through constructive
practical political experience.”
Joe Trattner, president of the
senior class, will act as chairman.
Robert Wilkins, Men’s Council

ganizors along iwith other active
memberspin school activities. Ad-
vsor is John Huston of the history
department. I ‘ '
The‘ chairman for "the . Pitt
Party is‘ R o b e rt ‘ Dickinson,
president of ODK. Emil Her-
manand Don Kettering, presi-'
dent of, Student Congress and
IF Council respectively are two
of the party organizers.‘

Their faculty L advisor’ is Dr.

President," is oneof the party or- .

Three Parties Gain Recognition

Holbert N. Carroll, Assistant pro-
fessor of political science. Their
platform is, “to give students edu-
cational experiences in demo-
cratic political parties; to pro-
mote greater interest in student

government; to best represent stu-

dent oppinion to the administra-
tion and faculty.”

The Veterans - Independent
Party, led by Joe Banik, Col.
-’56 and Dave, Guyol, Bus Ad
’57 will give the veterans and
independents an opportunity to
compete on an organized basis.

Dr.. Joseph Zasloff and D. G.
Schindler will serve as faculty
advisors. The aim of the V.I.P. is
“to give the independent student
a chance to participate in student
government; to co-ordinate inde-
pendent, fraternity and veteran
personel into a functioning group
to promote the best interest of the

/group and the university.”

- make sororities

vties. Women are given so many

opportunities to get in activities,
that they have no need of politi-
cal parties.”

Dean of Women Helen Pr
Rush cited Dean of Men Theo-
dore Biddle as saying that he
“regretted” political parties,’ but
thought men needed them be-
cause men don’t know one an-

~other, and he didn’t like un-
dercover p a r t i e s operating.
However, he thought they were
unnecessary for women.

Along this line, Marlene B1um- 

enthal queried, “Why should we
need political parties?’,’\ Other
thoughts expressed by the Com-
mission were that parties would
olitical factions;
there ‘was a fal acy in likening
this problem to the national situa-
tion because men overwhelmingly
outnumber women in SC; men on
SC can”: legislate for women stu-
dents; independent women are
not left out of activities as SC
wants everyone to. believe; and
the advantages drawn up by SC
were “insulting.”

Course To Discuss Modern Society

ThemeApproch Set

  

‘v

By JUDY GOTTEVRER ,

(Editdi-’s note: This is the second of a series on the basic courses
being planned for next year’s Core Curriculum.) ,
The basic course in social sciences will demonstrate the
interaction of the individual on society and society on the

approach.

individual by identifying the values and conflicts in modern
society with a theme kind of a

pproach rather than an epoch

The course will aim to explain the basic needs and
disposition of man——-the tools of man needed to survive in

a democratic society, and the¢

process by which society func-
tions——-by , contrasting a pre-in-
dustrial and an industrial society
with emphasis on causes for sta-
bility and change. _
Course Thesis

Thesis for the course will be
what makes for survival and
-growth and what are the factors
contributing. to the disappearance
of certain cultural groups, dis-
cussing the continuities and dis-
continuities in the social pattern.

“The student will have an an-
alytical rather than a descriptive
approach to the study of society,
and will be able to understand
further courses in the ﬁeld,” said
Dr. David Henderson, assistant
profe-ssorof sociology and chair-
man of the Social Sciences com-
mittee. _

The student will be provided
with both a knowledge and an
appreciation of how. a social
scientist thinks about facts. The
committee aims to arm the stu-
dent with facts, not for the sake
of facts themselves, but for the
purpose of increasing his un-
derstanding of the “indispen-
sable knowledge of society.”
They hope to have the student
develop skills in thinking about
facts and practice in adapting
those‘ skills to new or unfami-
liar materials. ~

A society’s power, structure,
leadership, wealth, order, cul-
tural lag, etc., will be discussed
to give an understanding of the
basic, organization pattern of any
society. Concepts presented will
be directed toward its application
in the study of any culture or so-
ciety. The student then must ap-
ply the principles to the social
relationship which he observes
or participates in.

Triple Division

The course will be divided into
three categories——an introduction,
the basic theme, and the sum-
mary.

The introduction will discuss
“What is meant by natural ,. re-

sources in both an industrial and
a pre-industrial society?” Which
resources have a relative,‘ im-
portance (soil and mountains)?
Whch resources represent sta-
bility (town sites, rivers, produc-
reproduction)? What is
social science? What makes for
stability and change?” ‘
Basicithemes of the course in-
clude human and natural re-
sources and their uses and dis-_
tribution,» principles and prob-
lems‘ of power and values and
conflicting values in societies.

In the summary division of the
course, the disciplines (depart-
ments of economics, geography,
history, political science, and so-
ciology) wil beintegrated and‘ re-
lated to each other.

“The course must be inte-
grated, not segmented into dis-

Senior Queen selection has long been a bitter pill for

(Editor’s note: Bud Hodgin, president of the

YMCA and executive secretary for Religion-In-1'

Life, here presents some of his views on next
week’s program. This is the third in a series of
four columns developed around the theme, “Ac-
cent on What is Vital.” -

By Bud Hodgin ,

I was confronted with a chemistry problem the
other day that was a real humdinger. Itnwas just
one great confusion and mass of information from
which it seemed almost impossible to derive any
logical relationship, Needless to say the majority

‘of the class were completely baffled. However, a

few people ,were able to recognize,the pertinent
data and ﬁt it together in such a way to produce
the correct answer. The process of piecing together
the information was difﬁcult enough, but the real
challenge of the problem was to abstract onlythat
information necessary for the solution.

Age Old’ Problem

Man has been engaged in this problem of deter-
mining what are the “essential elements” for
thousands of ' years.
along these lines may be readily seen today. The
physical sciences represent«man’s efforts to reduce
the universe to a group of theories and laws through

‘ which physical phenomena may be described and

interpreted. This has not been an easy task. In-
tensive thinking, sweat, frustration, and disappoint-
ment aregcommon among those who have advanced
and are ‘advancing the frontiers of physical sci-
ence. Likewise such sciences as sociology and psy-
chology reﬂect man’s search‘ for what is vital in
humor behavior and in man’s relationship with man.
The, essential elements ‘of thesesciences are more
illusive and variable than those of the physical
sciences and perhaps even more difficult to system-
atize. Thus much of the history, of man’s intel-
lectual development /centers about his striving to
eliminate the unessential and to “accent and organize
the essential. ‘

Pitt Players Review

\\ ’ H
Innocents

‘By Irv Roi-Iimon

Somehow we can sense when

Essential  lE|iernentst  

The result of his endeavors

   

No True Limit 

But man’s endeavors toward the essential are
not limited to the natural sciences. The science of
ethics reviews the whole scope of human affairs and
attempts ‘ to formulate the vital constituents of
human behavior and establish what may be termed
the “good life.” When we move from the physical

sciences to ethics, vital and essential are much more A

difﬁcult to deﬁne. The sum total of human experi-
ence and of human affairs is so varied and com-
plicated that ithseems ‘impossible that one man or
‘group of men can establish a certain code of morals
that deﬁne the “good” or “best” life.
good? What is bad? Who is qualiﬁed to decide?
How will I know the good life when I have found
‘it? Does it involve belief in God? These and many

other difﬁcult questions have been considered by

philosophers in their search for the vital core from
which emanate all that is signiﬁcant in human be-
havior and thought. 4,

‘I believe that as intelligent college students we
should desire, and further, are obligated to search
for this vital core so that We may be in harmony
with -the best life has to ‘offer. The study and
search for the center of life is not limited to the
conﬁnes. of philosophy. Originating hundreds of
years before Christ, Judaism offers a way of ex-
posing the vital core that many people have taken.
Likewise, Protestantism and Catholicism both of
which have done much to shape and enrich our
society are devoted to making life signiﬁcant and
worthwhile.

The Opportunity is Yours

¢

Perhaps as “Larry” in Somerset Maugham’s “The ,

Razor’s Edge” you will not ﬁnd what you seek in
Western Religion and philosophies and will look
elsewhere—this is your‘ choice+thef important thing
is to seek. The three days of RELIGION IN LIFE
offer you the opportunity to examine‘ what reli-
gion considers the vital elements. Take part----

"together we’ll roll up our sleeves and see if we
can put the proper accent on what is vital.

which Pitt Players in the cur-
rent production, “The Innocents”

offers to its -viewers tonight and "

tomorrow. Thespians have ﬁtted
together the pieces of a meaning-
ful plot to create so careful ' a
staging, such precise special ef-
fects, and so artistic a setting
that the viewer feels himself
wrapped in incidents which ex-
pound forceful life philosophy.

A Forceful Show

And that’s the word for the
current. show —— forceful. The
story, adapted to stage by Wil-
liam Archibald, is based on
Henry James’ moving novel,
“Turn of the Screw”. It presents
a situation common to life—— the
inexorable struggle b e t w e e n
good and evil.

The moralist might set out to
discuss home environment; and
the social worker, the case-
history that leads to the moral
imprisonment of the “innocents”,
young Miles and Flora, unable
to part from a terror—bond cre-
ated by former guardians._But
the ﬁnal effect of the show rests
for the individual to determine.
Players present the basic sub-
ject, Miss Gibbens’ ﬁght to win
back the souls of the children
whose former guardians cor-
rupted their minds and bodies.

On Edge of Seat

By the end of the performance,
this reviewer was on the edge’ of,
his seat, witnessinga scene be-
tween. young .Miles and gover-
ness Miss Gibbens that had
chills . running down ‘his back.

    

" terror that they constructed is a...

constant source’ of “amazement.
it Joy Smith as Miss Gibbens

sets the pace as the harried’

governess. It is ‘her ability to
build up the suspense to which
the others must react. And, Herb
Rebhun, who plays the arrogant,
cynical ward, more than matches
,her pace to develop a spine-ting-
ling performance. In the ﬁnal
scene, Miss Giddens is victorious
over the inﬂuence of Peter
Quint, long-dead guardian, but
at ‘a very costly price.

Because Vicki Buchsbaum, the
daughter Flora, is only ten-years
old, her performance takes on a
different perspective. It is equal
to the others. -A maturity and
understanding of her’ part which
appears beyond her age, enables
-a performance which can stand
up against any offered previously
on the Foster Memorial stage.

Flora Provides Relief

Flora provides relief from the,

tragic. results as she, in her
youth, is able to reject her in-
ﬂuencing formal guardian, Miss
J essel, and yet survives none the
worse for the hazardous experi-
ence. She leaves the family man-
sion to return to her uncle with
housekeeper Mrs. Grose, played
so effectively by Louise Chian-
ese. ’

Miss Chianese at any time
offers a moving performance,
and ‘ her great versatility is
proven as she switches from a
comedy lead held earlier this
year to the
acter of the house maid.

This review cannot effectively
explain the role. Because she re-
mains in the background for the
most part and silent of the sin-
ister happenings in the house,
but unable to inﬂuence the
youngsters herself, Mrs. Grose

- oﬁersa strange paradox to Quint
and Miss Jessel. Her failure to
report happenings in the man-
sion, probably resulted in as
much harm to the yttungsters as
was done the individuals men-
tioned. Yet she remains close to

_the youngsters, cognizant of their
plight, unable to offer suitable
assistance. ‘

A DifficuIt_ Show _
Pitt Players’ third production

inexplicable char- A

‘ pletely

roles however, director Harvey
Pope has been able to devote

personal attention to each char-'

acter. He must be given a lot of
_credit for his ability to interpret
the 'parts‘ and play to the actors
as well as staging. Misses Smith,
-Chianese, Buchsbaum and Herb

Rebhun follow through admir-

ably.

The, show builds up‘ in
suspense. It is not easy to es-
tablish the mood to effect chain
reactions which culminate in the
ﬁnal moving act. Thus, the
major fault ‘of the show lies in
the early scenes where both
dialogue and action isslow. Even
with the realization that the
characters must be developed,
because they are so important,
the general early impression is
one of tediousness. The audience
must wait before any stimulating
action gets under way.

“The Innocents” depends a
great ‘deal on special effects.
Appearance of two vaguely ap-
parent characters, Quint and
Miss Jessel risen from the grave,
re-quires lighting which plunges-
the stage into almost total dark-
ness. It seems however, that the
stage is cast far too long a time
in shadows, especially in the
scene during which Miss Giddens
accepts the challenge to combat
the evil inﬂuences. But it hardly
distracts from the show, and
certainly adds to the eeryeffects.

By tonight, curtain cues will
be picked up faster at the end
of scenes. Wednesday night, it
seemed that actors were left
standing as still-life between the
conclusion of dialogue and the
curtain fall. That is, except for

the last act which was quickest

with most action.

‘ Scenic Effects Unusual‘

Lloyd Welden, Jr., scenic de-
signer, took upon himself a
momentous task. Sound, light-.
ing, recorded music, and storm
portents’ are all necessary to the
exacting opration of “The Inno-
cents”. Mr. Welden has erected
audio outlets to create an im-
pression similar to that ofistereo'-
phonic sound. The audience is

M ermen Swim For Seventh 

Against Rutgers In Home Finale

By AL PELAEZ
Win number seven will be the objective for Coach Ben
Grady’s tankers against Rutgers tomorrow night at the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association pool.
The Scarlet mermen from New Brunswick should prove

troublesome to the Panthers

oﬁ past results. Both teams

defeated Lehigh, a common op-¢

ponent, by an almost identical
score and appear to be fairly
equal.

While the Blue and Gold seems
capable of racking up the ma-
jority of first place points, the
Scarlets are definitely the bet-
ter balanced squad. The have an
abundance of .second—line swim-
mers -capable of placing second
and third, thus piling up valuable
points.

The Scarlets’ strength rests in
the hands of Ed Balie, Jim John-
son, Mac McGuggan and Ron De-
Ascoli. Balie is favored to take
the 50-yard freestyle and DeAs-
coli should take a first in the
breaststroke.

Johnson, however, will have to

be at his best to beat Warne

White in the individual medley,
and McGuggan will have to turn
in his best effort t-o date to over-

"take Skip Monsien, Pitt record

holder in the backstroke event.

Saturday’s meet will mark the
final” home appearance for four
of the Panther mermen—Dick
Finder, Ralph Gaetano, Roy
Kaupe, and Bill Furrer. Kaupe
has ben one of the major factors
in the success of the medley and
freestyle relay teams and also has
shown well in the individual
medley.

Furrer has become one of the
top distance men in the east, and
diver Gaetano and breaststroker
Finder have added valuable
points throughout the season.

High.-Shooter Shepard Leads

Riflers in Tri-Meet Tomorrow

Tomorrow the Panther riﬂemen
meet Washington & Jefferson and
Carnegie Tech , in a triangular

meet at Tech. Pitt rules as the
favorite since they have already
beaten Tech in a meeting earlier
this season, 1349-1304.

Leading the ten-man team into
the match will be Captain Tom
Shepard, James Cleary, and Rich-
ard «Konis. Tom Klaric, "Dave
Jacobson, Dick Zwahlen, James

= Flynn, Dick Green, A1 Johnson,

and Bob Thompson are the other
men who will compete in the
sharpshooting.

Phi Delts W7in
In Last Stanza
For IF Crown

By JOHN BASTOLLA

Phi Delta Theta, with a thrill-
ing last quarter rally, trimmed
Sigma Chi 5-0-48 for the Inter-
fraternity league basketball cham-
pionship Wednesday at the Stad-
ium Pavilion.

The Phi Delts trailed through-
out the game until early in the
ﬁnal stanza. Behind 44-34 as the
whistle began play in the last
period, Phi Delt Jim Trebac con-
nected for six of his 18 points
and Mel Hammerstrom hit for
four to spark the rally which
brought victory to the men of Phi
Delta Theta.

Although the'Sigma Chi hoop-
sters played inspired ball. and
were the aggressors for the first
three quarters, the height ad-
vantage of the victorious Phi
Delts proved to be the deciding
factor in the game.

Trebac‘ and Hammerstrom
paced the victors with 18 and 15
points respectively while Tom
Myers dropped in twelve. Paul
Griffiths led the Sigma Chi ﬁve
with 14 points with Mike Tuchak
and Ron Brandt following close
behind with 12 and 10 points res-
pectively. ”, a

‘With three minutes to play
Sigma Chi held a one-point lead
at 45-44. Seconds later the Phi

defeated in six bouts while
Hulings sports a 5-3-1 chart.

Delts forged ahead at 46-45. Ron
Brandt then added one from the
foul line for the Sigs to‘ even
things up. After two more deuces
by the Phi Delts and one by the
losing Sigs, the score read 50-48
with the Phi Delts ahead.

In the last second, Ron Brandt,
who seconds earlier had knotted
the game, was fouled but missed
his two vital free throws and the

Phi Delts walked off the ﬂoor with
the‘ hard-earned championship in
their possession.

Extra-Curricular Activities Are
Important to Students; Sense of
Belonging Creates Friendliness

, « FRANK

Most of youare holding down positions which require
your attention and attendance for at least 40 hours each
week. Furthermore, many of you are involved with many
more hours of-family responsibilities. On top of this you
have chosen, for one reason or another, to further your edu-
cation. These last hours really represent time stolen from

By ED

can already crowded week.
This may seem at first glance

‘enough to" deter ‘anyone from in-

dulging in any extracurricular
activities, but let’s give the prob-
lem a closer reading.

One of, the factors which make

classes more rewarding and en-

joyable is the feeling of belong-
ing. Trite as this may seem, a per-
son knowing that he is an essen-
tial part of the class will impart
more_ freely with opinions and
ideas. This sense of belonging can
only be brought about through a
friendly. relationship among mem.-»
bers of the class. 4 A
_ Another rewarding feature of
extra-curriculars, and a very
practical one, is the variety of
ideas gained which may be put to
use in the business world. These
bits of information can be gained
at informal sessions over a cup
of coffee as well as in the class-
rooms.‘ 1 ‘ ' .
What about our families—the
wives, husbands, and children?

I’m sure they would be interested V

in attending some- of the events.
