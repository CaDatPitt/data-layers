Faculty Snuhs
Frat Invitation

To Open House

On the heels of Friday night’s
sociallyrsuccessful but ﬁnancially
failing Junior Prom, Sunday after-
noon’s Interfraternity-Faculty re-

ception became the second disap-
pointment added during the week-
end to the ever-growing list of
campus-wide failures.

The reception, sponsored by IF
council. proved disillusioning to
the Greeks who spent a large part
of the weekend cleaning and pol-
ishing their houses to welcome less
than 20 faculty members who vis-
ited them.

Edward Ray, IF council mem-
ber in charge of the event, stated
that 1500 personal invitations had
been mailed to faculty members.
Subsequent mail deliveries brought
four refusalsand seven accept-
'ances~.

Fraternities with open houses
were Delta Tau Delta, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Gamma, Phi Kappa, Pi
Lambda Phi, and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. ‘

Ready Model   

Assembly Bills

Fifty politicians pack their bills

and resolutions and head for Har-
risburg this week-end for the an-
nual Intercollegiate Conference on
Government which meets as a
model state legislature.

Headed by Aaron Cohen, stu-
dent chairman, the delegation has

. proposed bills ranging in subject

from veterans issues to puriﬁca-
tion of state streams. Twelve com-
mittees have been set up to study
every phase of state government.

Members of the conference will
be busy introducing, debating, and
adopting the legislative bills that
they feel necessary for state im-

. provement. '

Political sham-battles are ex-
pected when the factions from over
40 Pennsylvania colleges and uni-
versities meet in debate on the
house ﬂoor. 1

Political science students will
comprise the bulk of the politic-
ians at the convention. They plan
to meet in a legislature that will
operate under the present state
constitution. The only. exception

is that the legislature will be
unicameral. -
, Highlight of the convention

will be ‘the election of the speak-
er of the house. Pitt’s candidate
has not been announced to date,
but Eugene Lichter has been ap-
pointed committg chairman of
veteran affairs.

Delegates will relax from the
routine of law—making on Satur-
day night, April 19, at a grand ball

Ca1's,__like the green grass, grow all around, around the
Oatliedral--orlso “it would seem to the casual observer. But we
know different. We know that we are not a. displaced branch
of a. Detroit. automobile plant, although a‘ conveyor belt here and
there‘ would come in handy around 8:30 any morning in
Schenley Oval.

Inventors of the automobile would have turned their brain-
child over in their minds several thousand times before giv-

A ing the world the gas buggy" if they could have foreseen the
antics,» the small scale ‘maneuvers’ carried on by automobile
jockeys everywhere around Pitt.

_ (Rumour has it that Jerry Josephs rises at 6 in the morn-
ing, drives to Schenley Oval, and selects the choice parking
spot. There he remains until the; last car space is ﬁlled,” which
happens about 9 o’clock. Then he. climbs onto the car roof,
auctions off his parking space to the student who will buy
the largest ad in the News for the next edition, then drives
back -home-to dream up more ways of ‘selling pads.) 

Early in the year Student congress, recognizing the park»
ing problem around school, wrote a letter to City officials. Then,

7 ,action was taken by University administrators. Negotiations

were ﬁnally climaxed this past weekend in the marking off
of, parking spaces in and around Schenley Oval. Along with
doing this, the City has agreed’ to ‘police the area for two or
three weeks. to instruct students in the» new parking system.
After the three—weeks period, it is hoped that students will be
well enough oriented to park without. supervision.

_ VVe must be aware, too, that Schcnley Oval is not our p'ri~
vote parking lot and that when the baseball season opens we
must relinquish our privileges to park there. To reiterate our
parking story of last Week, Schenley Oval will be parked solid

iduring baseball games, and anyone Wishing to move his car
before 5 o’clock must re—park it,’ or risk becomming hemmed in.
In co-operating with the University, the City has under-
taken to alleviate a problem created by us. It is now up to
us ‘to do all that we can to make thencw system a success,
thus helping ourselves besides showing the City that we appre-

ciate its cooperation.

Salute to the Disc Jockey

During the Easter’ vacation I
dropped over to KQV and inter-
viewed Al “Nickels” Nobel. Re-
laxing for a few minutes, Al rat-
tled off a littleinfo. He is a Pitts-
burgh boy who started singing
with Carl Hoff. Two years later
he switched to Charlie Spivak and
worked with him for two months.
After Spivak it was two years
with Hal McIntyre and then back
home.

At present he is the disc jockey
of the ever popular KQV Juke

Aside from his duties at the sta-
tion Al has been MC at popular

a ten-piece band which plays at
proms and parties.

He has also made a few wax-
ings on the Emerald label. The
latest recording is “Sooner Or
Later” and “You Broke The Only

Eddie Howard is out with an-
other hit on Majestic. This time,
it’s a cute little ditty called “My
Adobe Hacienda” and the reverse
is “Midnight Masquerade,” a
beautiful dance tune . . . Frankie

hit the top. Too bad for Frankie

Art Lund takes the spotlight to-
day for his ﬁne chirping of the
new French song “Mam Selle”
which was used as the theme for
the motion picture “The Razors
Edge.” It has all the earmarks of
being ahit; excellent vocal rendi-
tion ,well—orchestrated
ground, soothing melody, and
lovely lyrics. Lund’s striking bar-
itone Voice does equally well on
the other side as he tells about
that “Sleepy Time Gal.” It’s a def-
inite switch from the haunting
“Mam’Selle”, but it is uniquely
done. ‘I've been told that
“Mam’Selle” will be released by
another artist and the vocals will
be done; in both English and
