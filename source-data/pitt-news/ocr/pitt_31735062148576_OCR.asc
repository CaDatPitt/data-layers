Carlson Announces
Renewal of Drives
Against Syphilis, TB

In a continuation and uniﬁcation
of the anti-syphilis and anti-tuber-
culosis drives originated on campus
by the Pitt News two years ago, the
Student Health Service will admin-
ister free Wassermann and tubercu-
lin tests to all students desiring
them, announces Dr. H. C. Carlson,
director, today.

Wassermann’s will be adminis-
tered from Monday until next Fri-
day, while the tuberculin tests will
be given during the week immedi-
ately following the. resumption of
classes, April 8 to 17, inclusive.
Both tests will be given in the head-
quarters of Student Health Service,
located in Falk clinic.

Began Two Years Ago

Originating two years ago as a re-
sult of an investigation of Wasser-
mann tests given on other campi,
the anti-syphilis campaign spread
from the University through the
mid-west, and out to the Paciﬁc
coast, where coastal campi have

, been waging a similar war against

venereal ‘diseases. The drive was
“backed to the hilt” by Pitt stu-
dents and when the ﬁnal needle
was sterilized, it was found that
over two thousand
been tested.

Spurred on by the success of the

, anti-syphilis drive in the fall of

1937, the spring saw another drive

i . against disease; this campaign being

levelled against tuberculosis. Stu-
dents taking the free test numbered
2,129. As a follow-up measure, and
one which will probably be carried
out this yea,r,,secondary tests, con-

‘ sisting of X-rays, were given at'a
greatly reduced costpto those show- ,

ing positive reactions.

Painless Tests . .
"The tests are practically painless.

explains Dr. Carlson, who, together

with or. Zehfuss, will administer

them. In one, a small sample of

, the patients blood is taken, while in-

the other, a ‘simple skin analysis is
made. A

' These tests-, offered free, repre-
sentia great saving to students tak-
ing them. Wassermanns, given at a

hospital, cost $5, and, if admintered , '

regularly at the health service cost
$1. The secondary test for tuber-
culosis is also administered to stu-
dents during this period at greatly
reduced cost. X—rays ordinarily
taken at a cost of $5 have been re-
duced to $2.

With I-F Men

Establishment of a steering
committee and deﬁnition. of I11-
terfraternity Council ’s aims in
the coming student elections
were steps taken at a policy-
determining meeting of the fra-
ternity group on Wednesday eve-
ning. Council also decided that fra-
ternity women and dental students
would be included in the political
set-up

Five members of the council were
elected to make up the committee
having the following functions: to
handle all publicity; to handle pro-
cedures in meeting; to make all po-
litical contacts; to set up tentative
slates to be voted upon by council;
and to have the authority to speak
for council.

Heading the board as publicity
outlet on all political matters is
James Kennedy, C40, Delta Tau
Delta, presdent of I-F council. Other
members are: Bill Edmunds, E40,
Phi Gamma Delta; Don Ceferatti,
C40,«Sigma Alpha Epsilon; Al Lud-
wig, BA41, Theta Chi; and Morton
Lincoﬁ, BA41, Phi Epsilon Pi.

Kennedy explained the commit-
tee’s duties as follows: “This group
has been. set up merely to present
to council a certain amount of or-
ganization and procedure that- is
more easily taken care of by a small
number of men.”

The following attitudes were re-
vealed by the president in regard
to the fraternity program: .

cided to set next Wednesday as the

Cuests to

Greek Hosts

Fraternity men are not only hold- I

ing a progressive dance Saturday
night for all independents and fra-
ternity women, but they’re also
giving their guests a chance to tell
the public how they rate various
fraternities on campus.

Following up his promise in
Wednesday’s News of a surprise
connected with the Interfraternity

progressive dance, Don Cefaratti,

C40, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, reveal-
ed" today the novel ‘plans for the
dance. Every guest, -according to

Cefaratti, will be asked to ﬁll out a-
each fraternity for ,

speciﬁc qualities. . :
Voting Procedure

The guests will vote not only on
the best decorated house but on the
following qualities of each group:
sociability, appearance, and so-
phistocation. ‘ ’

Ballots must be left at the fra-
ternity houses Saturday night.

Although a few of the fraterni-
ties have not decided on the theme
of their dances yet, the majority
have made their choices. The Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon house will turn
into an old rustic Irish Tavern
while Kappa Sigma will really “go
Irish” with a Saint Patrick’s‘day
celebration. Pi Lamba Phi will be-
come Tammany Hall.

Theme is Informality

Jokes are in order for the Delta
Tau Deltas who will feature “Con-
fucius Say.” Tht Pi Kappa Alphas
will carry out a Pitt theme, while
“Joe College” will dance at the
Phi Epsilon Pi. house. Not to be
outdone by Sigma Chi’s beach par-
ty, Phi Gamma Delta will take a
trip to the “Fiji Islands.” Sigma
Alpha Mu will satirize war.

Main theme of every house is in-
formality. Tag dances eliminate
the necessity of dates; so there is no
reason for any student’s not coming.
Every house will be open from 8:30

to 12:30 o’clock and will serve re-

freshments.

If “M” Day Ever Comes to Pitt

Holcombe Discusses Effect of War on University

By Ray Palkot

A West Point at Pittsburgh?

Yes, the University will proba-
bly become an academy, the same
as the Hudson river school, if
America suddenly plunges into
war, reveals Colonel John J. Hol-
combe, professor of military sci-
ence and tactics.

Not only will there be a violent
change in student life with pay for
all males going to school and with
living quarters at the Hotel Schen-
ley, and Webster Hall, but the head
of the University, Chancellor John
G. Bowman, will take the position
of colonel, a classiﬁcation he holds
in the reserves, possibly at the head
of a government chemical unit.

All his theories on war condi-

V tions in America are based on anal-

ogy, Colonel Holcombe said.

There will be two drawbacks for
men students, however. Students
will have to sleep six or eight to a
room which formerly accommo-
dated only one and will have to get
up at 5 o’clock every morning.

Those who have graduated from
the University with two years of
ROTC, he says, have nothing to fear
because they are no records of them
in Washington. Students who have
accepted commissions in the re-
serves will have to serve when they
are called upin ‘their reserve units.

For a short time, at least, stu-
dents who are under 21 will not
have to..worry immediately about
 war, says Colonel Holcombe. Aft-
er a call for volunteers, the ﬁrst sec-

tion to be drafted will be those 21
years of age.

If there is a war this year, those
who are 21, those belonging to the
class of 1940, will be drafted as a
unit. Those 21 to 30 years old will
be taken first, then those that are
younger.

Women will play a minor role in
case of war, but they will be per-
mitted to continue their college
work.

The war department will not im-
mediately take students from their
universities. Instead, they will be
trained by the ROTC so that they
can enter the army after they grad-
uate as oﬁicers.

There will be no censorship,,
Colonel. Holcombe states, other than
public opinion censorship.

Dr. Einar \V. Jacobsen, at present superiiitendent of schools at
Oakland, Cal, will assume his duties as the new dean of the School
of Education September 1, Chancellor John G. Bowman has an-

nounced.

Succeeding Frank VV. Shockley, who has been acting dean for

be last year and one-half, Dr.
Jacobsen will assume direction of
one of the three largest schools
of education in American uni-
versities. Mr. Shockley will con-
tinue his present work as director
of the Extension Division and of
Summer Sessions.
National Reputation

Prior to Shockley, the dean of the

says Miss Plummer, “and well
worth the trip up the hill.”

By Student Opinion Surveys

AUSTIN, TEX., March 15—Al-
though less than one-third of col-
lege students are eligible to vote in
state or national elections, nearly
nine out of every ten believe they
should not be allowed to go to the
polls before they are 21. _ ,

This is shown in a national study

you for or against lowering the vot-

Froslenlmn Affair

Pitl'.’s athletic policy has again received public
notice The current outburst involving the fresh-
man athletes bears a close resemblance. to the troll-
ble last vear which preceded the resignation of
Jock Suthcrlancl as head football coach.

llvlauy of the facts of this affair are not yet clear.
The most obvious bone of contention is the ap-
parentlv confused system of ﬁnancial aid t0 The
freshmen. According to the statements of fresh-
man athletes questioned bv the Pitt News, 11151113’ Of
the boys have not reached a clear understanding

with the University about their work or tuition
problems.

This difficulty arose out of the problem which
the University faced when it began to enforce the
Code Bowman; the present freshman and sopho-
niore classes had to be placed on a. scale of aid
different from the status of the juniors and seniors.
From this view of the situation, the current prob-
lem is nothing more than a. “grovving pain” result-
ing from the change in athletic policy.

The manner in which the petition of the fresh-
men was made public indicates that sources outside
the l_J'ni.versit_v may have interfered with the affairs
of the athletes. And the possibility that thisiyear’s
freshman class decided to capitalize on past trou-
bles at Pitt in order to_ cash in on their “nuisance
value 1”." “can’t be entirely overlooked.

Nancy Sundstrom and Howard Uptegiaff get our
vote as the handsomcst couple at the highly successful
Musicians’ Ball last week . . “Honest John” Fergu-
son, who invariably picks the wrong numbers out of
the prize box, was seen at the Musicians’ Ball dancing
with Bob Botkin’s very lovely sister, Audrey . . It’s
reliably reported that Bud Sch1esinger’s gal, small and
vivacious Elaine Fierman, was a sensation at the Cap
and Gown dance with her singing.

We fear that the fraternities will regret their de-
cision to hold open house for all the students tomor-
row night. It is rumored that the Independents, led
by J. Wishart Hoeveler, intend to parade en masse
from one house to the other and carry off the frat
prexies for souvenirs.

That Pitt Player publicity picture of Lois Galbreath,
the blonde charmer, which graced the ground floor
lobby was up only one day before some unkind person
ﬁlclied it. Can’t say that we blame him . . Homer

on a dance floor that they should pay double admission
price. But they do dance divinely.

1914. ' A  ' '

(.2) A more alert student mind——“p7fopagafnd'a must

(3) A decision on the part. of students to “put a
ring of iron‘ ‘around,thé United States.” and a refusal

least to -be "‘c_1u overt a,ttack,upo,n__‘this nation.”

(4) “A general feeling in the United States that
we must take ‘some responsibility for peace and recon
st-ructiou after the war.’’ '

On this ﬁrst point, he says: I '

“There is an awareness today, which was not present
during the last war. For instance, when I landed in
New York, after my trip abroad, the reporters all wanted
to know: ‘When are we going to get into it?’ ‘Will
we get into it?” ‘How long will it be?’ The war had
then been under way about two weeks.

“I said, ‘Do you know, gentlemen, that you are ask-
ing questions now, after two weeks that were not asked
in World War I until after two years?’ And that is the
situation that exists everywhere, including the col-
leges.”

President Ford is probably the country’s greatest
authority on the moulding of student opinion. During
the last war, he served as director of the division of
civic and educational cooperation of the immensely
powerful "Committee on Public Information. It was
his duty to build American solidarity in the schools
and universities. 0

Are today’s student ripe for war propaganda? And
will it differ from the propaganda of 1917-18? To the
ﬁrst question, President Ford replied ﬂatly, “Not at all.
I feel that it would take what appeared to be an overt
attack upon this nation now to rouse students to war.
But there doesn’t. seem to be any action in regard to
peace——simply a state of mind, a determination to put
a ring of iron around the United States.”

Stressing the “awareness” which he ﬁnds present
today, President Ford noted that “there is a much
higher level of intelligence in this country. Of course,”
he added, “there should be. We have more avenues of
information open to us.”

1*“There seems,” he pointed out, “to be little doubt
in this country as to who precipitated this war. Public
opinion polls show that the country has already placed
the blame. No such situation existed at the start of
the last war.

“I think that as a result of all this, propaganda must
be more subtle. The old horror and atrocity stories of
1914 won’t work any more.”

And here President Ford warned against too loose
condemnation of that Word. “Everything is being la-
belled ‘propaganda’ ” he , said. “Particularly those
things we don’t like. There is a tendency to believe
no-thing. There is danger in that direction, too.”

In the Mail

Editor, the Pitt News:

Sheﬂer’s letter reminds us of the difference be-
tween fraternity men and independents. A fraternity
man-is one who wears a clean collar, saddle shoes, and
shorts. An independent is one who wears a clean col-
lar, saddle shoes, and shorts.—F. S. M., C41.

Editor’s note—This letter, coming from a staunch
Independent, should put an end to a pointless aspect
of the old fraternity us, independent squabble.

Let this letter serve as an excellent example of
brevity to future letter-writers on campus problems,
political or otherwise.

Era Spite of Uncle Sam

llniversity Establishes its Uwn
Pension Plan for Professors

Uncle Sam may rel‘use to lend a
helping hand to worn out profes-
sors and faculty members but all
is not lost for the U11i.ve:‘si.ty comes
to the aid of its own.

It was announced recently by G.
Stanley Rupp, assistant treasurer
that heirs of the University faculty
member and other employees who
died during 1939, were paid a total
of $12,500 ‘through a group life in-
surance plan.

Out of the 670 persons partici-
pating in the plan. ﬁve died last
year, and money was given to their
heirs.

Universities and colleges are not
eligible to participate under the
Federal Social sectirity laws and so
must establish their own pension
plans.

The University has established
such a plan which provides free of
charge to each eligible person
$1,000 of group life insurance and
permits him to purchase an addi-
tional amount of insurance to the
amount by which his annual salary
exceeds $1,000 up to a maximum of
$10,000. The additional insurance
is provided at an annual cost to the
employee of $6 per year for each
$1,000. ‘

All Inernbers_of the faculty and
staff who receive a salary of $1,250
or more annually are eligible.

Each year the cost of the plan to
the University increases because the

The Pitt News

F loorm.en. Go From Tops to Terrible

By Phil Lynch

For the second time in three
years, a Pitt basketball team has
dropped more than half its
games. The recent loss to \\'est
Virginia in the 1939--l0 ﬁnale
swung the seasons pendulum
from an even .500 percentage to a
losing season of eight Wins and nine
setbacks.

Only two other times in Dr. Carl-
son’s coaching carrer has a Panther

team dropped more games than it
has won. They were 1924 and 1938.
No “Win ’em All”

Until this season coach Carlson’s
won-lost average at Pitt was .691.

Of late, the dynamic doctor’s
“win ’em all” motto hasn’t been
much more than a hope. It has been
four years now since the Carlson
system has ﬂashed the brilliance
that stood out in the days of Hyatt,
Cribbs, Jesko and company.

‘An unusual feature of the past
campaign was the fact that the
Panthers failed to win a return
match. They defeated Carnegie
Tech by more than 20 points, West
Virginia by the same wide margin.
Yet in return games, both teams
swamped the Blue and Gold. Penn
State, the only other quintet met
twice, also got revenge for an earlier
Pitt victory.

me and Cold

All season the Panthers were
what experts called a “hot and
cold” team. They were tops against
the hapless Tartans, West Virginia,
Ohio State and Fordham. It was
when they opposed the Ram outﬁt
in Madison Square garden that crit-
ics began wondering about the wav-
ering Pittsburgh aggregation.

‘ §The New York Times in a post-
game review had only praise for the
Pitt team. “It is a wonder that such
masters of the fast break are not
among the: leading —- teams in the
country,” the : Gotham’ V’ newspaper
psajid. ‘ " ‘ E ' '1 9.

‘The Jungle Cats startedpthbe sea-
son with a ﬁve-gaihé invasioﬁ of

ern, Michigan, and Ohio State." 1
Beat Ohio State , , . .

Michigan tore away in an over-
time to a 10-point lead and held it
at the ﬁnish. Butler, Northwest-
ern, and Indana felt the heat of a
first-half Panther attack but all
three came back strong in the ﬁnal
chapter to win hands down.

the Panthers to a two-point victory.

'1_‘he Carlsonmen then hit their
stride as they copped four in a row.
Eddie Straloski found the hoop for
122 points to help lick Penn State.
Cornell, Westminster and Carnegie
Tech fell victims before the Panth-
ers’ fast-breaking attack. Straloski
cracked Charley Hyatt’s all-time
record when he ﬂicked 32 points
through the rim against Tech.

Geneva and Waynesburg were
next to break up the Panther party,

Four Fresh
ﬁage Teams
Tie For ‘Lead

The Defrosters threw the Fresh-
man basketball league» into a four-
way tie Wednesday when they
downed the Coldspots in a hot bat-
tle, 29-27. The championship will
be decided next week when the De-
frosters, Coldspots, Snowﬂakes, and
Penguins compete in an elimina-
tion series.

The ﬁrst game will be played on
Wednesday at 3:30 o’clock with the
Defrosters meeting the Penguins.
The Coldspots will tackle the Snow-
flakes at 4:30 and the Wednesday
winners will square off in the
championship game on Friday at 4
o’clock

Last Wednesday’s battle was close
all the way as both teams played
strong ‘defensively.’ Captain Tay
Malarkey of the Defrosters starred
as he sank seven ﬁeld ‘goals and
three charity tosses for a total of 17
points. His last basket sewed up
the ball game in the ﬁnal minute
of play.

but Port carried his team to wins
over Fordham and Navy with 12
and 15 points respectively.

Straloski marked up a total of 25
and Sam Milanovich tossed in 16
points in a single half against the

x/lountaineers.

Pitt wavered near the end of the
season. Carnegie Tech, Penn State
and West Virginia, all earlier Panth-
er victims, walloped the Carlson-
ites in the return matches.

Five seniors played their last for
the Blue and Gold. They are Jack
Scherer, Bob Johnson, Lou Mend-
low, Danny Vujnovic, and Charley
Ptacek.

Hi-ﬂocks Upset
Amity lieglers

Amity Club’s intramural bowling
champions were upset in the third
phase of the all-campus tournament
last Wednesday by the undefeated
IIi—Rocks outfit. The win, third of
the tournament for the Rocks, left
them the only ‘undefeated team in
the rapidly thinning ranks.

Two more teams were dispersed

in Wednesday’s session. The Rah- .

Rahs bowed out before the Pi Lams
and the Theta Chi’s were eliminated
in a decisive manner by the Indus-
trials. ,

A minor upset was scored when
the Chem Engineers stopped a pre-

Burt Engelsburg,- who holds the,

highest average for three games in
the intramural league, took the in-
dividual scoring honors for the day
with a 182. .
Second-‘place honors were ‘snared
by the ,Industria1’s Emil DeLeo and
George 'La'nz of the Sweepers, each

M ushball eatures Competition,
In S pring Intramural Prograin

Competition in the spring intra-
mural program is expected to top
last year’s when campus teams take
the ﬁeld some time nextweek.

According to the intramural office,
entries for the four sports have
come in as anticipated.

Mushball will probably hold the
greatest part of the intramural spot-
light with several teams conceded
more than an outside chance to win.-

Pre-season estimates place last
year’s fraternity champs, Sigma Al-
pha Mu, in the favorite role. The
Sammies will again have the serv-
ices of their ace hurler, Lou Mend-
low, who pitched his brothers into
the ﬁnals ].ast season. “ , I

Gamma Gamma Woos also are an
outﬁt which must be considered in
any pre-season plans. ‘

The Oil & Gas teamappears at
this point to have theedge in the
engineer circuit although plenty of

competition is sure to develop.

Tennis will send the Newman
club back to its old spot as the fa-
vorite. Other teams entered in the
net race are the Aces and the
Sweepers. The iraternity tennis
league will have 12 Greek teams
represented.

Amity athletes, out to add plenty
of titl-es to the championship regis-
tered in bowling a few days ago, are
banking most on golf and tennis.
The road to the golf title will be a
bumpy one though, with the cham-
pion Delta Tau Delta putters stand-
ing invthe way.

Horsesho’es,~‘ the sport which al-
most was pushed to the rear by poor
‘weather conditions, Will again be
the most uncertain to predict. How-
ever, if any one team has the right
to be called a favorite it should be
the defending Delts who outshad—
owed all other competition.

Eitance in Butler° Reiays

Pitt’s much-traveled track squ: cl
will add 1,000 more miles to their
already large 1940 total when they
compete in the Butler Relays this
week—end at Indianapolis.

Chances for a team title are not
so good as they were previous to

ac ICAAAA and CIC meets, but,
with the return of Frank Ohl and
Del Anderson to the wars, the
Panthers must be considered a dis-
tinct threat. Two of the best bal-
anced squads in the Big Ten, In-
diana and lvlichigan, must be made
prohibitive favorites.

B-road Jump Gone

Addition of the mile sprint med-
ley relay to the program in lieu of
the broad jump comes at a very
inopportune time for Pitt, for last
;:car Long John Woodrufi‘ sewed
up this particular relay every time
out, and this year Ohl is giving
some of the best broad jumping
[3-e27fo:rrnan_<;’es in the country.

*lowever Ohl’s return bolsters
the mile relay team considerably,
and the Pant.hers may be due to
click for their ﬁs-s"c 1940 relay ‘title.
Defending cliainpions in the event,
the Olson i'oursome will probably
include Ohl, Al McKee, Bud Graf,
and Larry Tregonning.

Al Ferrara, laid up with grippe,
is an absentee member for the ﬁrst
time in his colorful four-year
career.

Great Sprint Race

When Butler officials received the
late entry of Penn State, they were
assured a great sprint race, for the
battle between the nation’s soph_o_-
more sprint satellites, Barney Ewell,
Penn State, and Hap Stickel, and
Bill Carter, Pitt, promises a brillian
60-yard sprint. .. '

Stickel also will make a strong
bid for the 60-yard low hurdle title.
The Butler timbers are run .with

hurdles placed ten yards apart in-
stead of the usual twenty. In a
practice session last week Stickel
tied the track house record for two
20 yards apart hurdles while essay-
ing four 10 yards apart hurdles!
Anderson Anchors

Other Blue and Gold thinclads
who have been in the spotlight
around the indoor circuit who will
be in individual title chases include
Dave McDowell, junior high jump-
er; Dusty Rhoades, the sophomore
pole vaulting star; Joe Newman,
junior hurdler; and Johnny Bazyk,
senior shot put front ranker.

Anderson will either anchor the
sprint medley with Ohl, Carter and
Stickel, or the two-mile relay team
with Graf, McKee, and one other
cinderman.

Await Players’

Case Uutceme

Publicity Campaign
For Play Involves
Handhill Regulation

Publicity men of University
organizations are eagerly await-
ing the outcome of a trial case
involving the Pitt Players in al-
leged violations of University
publicity rules.

These regulations, set up in a let-
ter sent to all organizations early in
January by Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant dean of men, apparently
went unheeded in a publicity cam-
paign for “Adding Machine” Pitt
Players sponsored during the past
fortnight.

On seeing handbills which the
Players passed out late this week,
Biddle stated, “If these are hand-
bills and not programs, then I am
against them. I intend to do some-
thing about this.”

Climaxing a campaign of black-
board writing, the publicity work-
ers gave out advance copies of their
programs on the walk outside of the
Cathedral late this week. These
large sheets, Pitt Players represen-
tatives said, are not handbills; they
are only programs. B

The publicity rules forbid not
only blackboard writing, but also
the pasting of stickers on parts of
the University and the passing of
handbills in the Cathedral. The
rules also state that permission for
publicity space in the University
must come from William Daufen-
bach, assistant to the dean of men.

Earlier in the year, Joe Miller,
E40, business manager of the Play-
ers, stated “I do not think that these
rules are fair to the organizations
which have too little publcity space
now.” Commenting on the present
situation of blackboard writing, he
said, “I am so busy that it might
have slipped in.” He had no com-
ment on the handbills.

Prize play by Elmer Rice, and cur-

Heading a cast of 28, is Bill Pat-
rick, C41, who as the plugging Mr.
Zero struggles through his monot-
onous life only to have his brief bit
of happiness in heaven snatched
from him. Other major parts will
be taken by Edna Kaufmann, BA40,
as Mrs. Zero, and Betty Brunk,
Ed40, as Daisy Diana Dorothea De-
vore.

Fraternities

Continued from page one
fraternity party will be called to a
separate meeting with the steering
committee of I-F Council to select
iheir candidates and be endorsed by
the fraternity party. The dents
will be included if they so desire
on the same basis as that under
which women’s fraternities are to be
made a part of I-F Council’s po-
litical set up.”

Candidates to be endorsed by the
party will be selected on the fol-
lowing basis:

1. I-F Council, composed of two
representatives either appointed or
elected by each of the 13 men’s fra-
ternities, will convene in a special
meeting to select the candidates.

2. Each house will present the
qualiﬁcations of any man seeking
political backing in the coming
campaign.

Majority Vote Needed.

3. Final selection of the candi-
dates to be endorsed by the party
will be by majority vote in coun-
oil.

4. Slating the candidates will be
done by the steering committee and
presented to the council for approv-
al. A two-thirds vote will be nec-
essary to approve the slating.

Candidates for campus positions
will be presented by the individual
fraternities at a meeting of coun-
cil on Tuesday evening at the Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon house. The steer-
ing committee will hold its ﬁrst
meeting in the Delta Tau Delta
house on Monday afternoon.

Aims of Plan

Disclosing the ‘aims of the coun-
cil’s venture ‘into politics, Kennedy
stated:

“The plan has a deﬁnite purpose:
to enable the fraternities to have
an equal voice in the selection of
the candidates which their party
will endorse. It is believed by coun-
cil that through this method the
fraternity groups will be able to
present a better qualiﬁed group of
candidates to the student body at
the,', coming general election.

“It is not the plan of I-F Coun-
cil to place any man in SFA, Men’s
Council, or the College Association
just for the purpose of controlling
these groups, but rather it "is to
present the best men possible‘ for
each elective job on campus. It is
only through this medium of hav-
ing the most capable candidates for
each job that the student body will
be enabled to select goodimen for

the student governing organizations.

“I-F Council hopes that everyone
will recognize the honesty and sin-
cerity of this effort and that the stu-
dent body will accept it as a def-
inite contribution to the good health
of the University.”

students. It has been through this
institution alone that the Indepen-
dent Party has sought to bring merit
into student government.

“Realizing that we, the executive
committee of the Independent Party,
are representing 87 per cent of the
student body who are non-frater-
nity, we feel it is our responsibility
to leave the nominaton of candi-
dates for the student governing
bodies open to the student as a
whole.

“We are firmly pledged to repre-
sent reliably the great majority of
University students and we fur-
ther believe that it is only through
the means of an open convention
that democracy and equality can be
maintained.”

The executive committee of the
party consists of members who were
chosen at a mass meeting of the
party in December.

Junior members are Rugy Al-
disert, C; Dorothy Ann Carrier, C;
Bill McElwain, C; Esther Marcuson,
C; Robie Tucker, and Adele Yorio,
E. Sophomore representatives are
Bernadette Blatt, C; Jack Brady, C;
Hiram Milton, C; and Lew Riley,C.

Senior men are Jack Hoeveler,
C, and J. Karl Stark, C.

No deﬁnite date for the next
executive committee meeting was
set. Nor did party spokesmen say
whether or not the committee
would make an recommendations
of candidates on the ﬂoor of "ﬁfe
nominating convention.

THEY’RE OFF! Streaking down the mile-long icy trough of the
Mt. Van Hoevenberg run at Lake Placid, N. Y. with “Bucky” Wells
driving. Fifteen breath-taking turns to go. Fifteen chances to taste
the supreme thrills of speed. But in smoking it’s diﬁerent, very
different. “It’s slow burning that makes a_ cigarette tick with me,”
“Bucky” Wells says. And he means what he says, because slow-bum-
ing Camels have been his cigarette for ten years.

 

“ONE-TWO-BOB! ONE-TWO-BOB!” And, as the crew bobs,
“Bucky” picks up speed...60—70—80 miles an hour, driving high on
the glassy wall of ice as he swings the quarter-ton steel sled around
the curve. But in the field of cigarettes, this daring speedster gives
the Iaurels to the quality of slow burning that he ﬁnds in Camels.
You can tell by their mild, mellow taste that Camels burn cooler,
slower—and scientists have conﬁrmed this. (See panel, right.)

THE SLOW-BURNING CIGARETTE

“Bucky” Wells of Keene Valley, N. Y.
can tell you. He’s done it plenty of times.
He likes those speed-thrills on a racing
bob. But when it comes to cigarettes,
“Bucky” Wells is on the slow side...the
slow-burning side. That means Camels!

“I’ve smoked Camels for years, and I
know they burn slower,” “Bucky” says.
“There’s cool comfort in a Camel. Mild-
ness - more ﬂavor. And — slow burning
means extra smoking. Yes, penny for
penny, Camels are the best cigarette buy.
‘I’d walk a mile for a Camel!’”

Why would anybody feel that way
about his cigarette? Try a Camel and see.
Camels are a matchless blend of costlier
tobaccos...slow-burning. They give more
pleasure per puff, more puffs per pack.

In recent laboratory tests, CAMELS
burned 25% slower than the average of
the 15 other of the largest-selling brands
tested—slower than any of them. That
means, on the average, a smoking plus
