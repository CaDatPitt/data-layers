Judge Juanita Stout

To Address Opening
Rally on Wednesday

Judge Juanita Kidd Stout,
Democratic candidate for
the Pennsylvania Superior
Court, will address the open-
ing rally of the Pitt S-tu-
dents for Shapp-Staisey on
Wednesday at noon in the
SU Supper Room.

Candidate for Superior Court.

Activists’
  Meeting
Cancelled

“The Movement for Social
Change,” scheduled -to be dis-
cussed last Friday by seven ac-
tivist groups, was cancelled due

‘ to a “misunderstanding,” accord-
ing to HEP Executive Board mem-
ber Loren Hershey.

Hershey explained that “the
American Friends Service Com-
mittee apparently wasn’t inform-
ed that it was to serve as a co-
sponsor of the meeting.” The
American Friends were respon-
sible for the cancellation of the
Friday meeting, Hershey stated.

Hershey did want to emphasize
that the scheduled event “was a
panel discussion and wasn’t the
formation of any group, as some
people believed.” _

Speaking of the cancellation,
Dean of Student Affairs Helen
P. Rush pointed out that “al-
though I thought unrecognized

University groups shouldn’t have '

been brought in, I had no inten-
tion of canceling the meeting. I
never would have cancelled it,”
she emphasized.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

MDC Suspends Old Rule;  I
Literature to be Distributed

(See E'd2'torz'al—“MDC’s Logical
Compr'om2'se”——Page Four)

By DAN BOOKER.

The rules restricting dis-

semination of literature in-

the Towers have been sus-
pended for a four Week trial
period by Tom Mei_sner,
president of Mens -Dormitory
Council (MDC). The suspension
is designed to “give the men an
opportunity to d'ecide if they
‘want to keep the old policy,” ex-
plained Meisner.

Under the “old” policy, organi-

zations and individuals are not .

allowed to distribute litera-ture to
each dormitory room.. All litera-

‘ ture must be passed out from

special booths in the Towers’

lobby. The suspension of these‘

rules, ‘which, says Meisner, “are
designed to insure the privacy of
the men in the dorms,” drew lit-
tle praise from‘ the University
students who have campaigned

' for the elimination of these rules

since they were initiated a year
ago.

Mahmood Mamdani, former
candidate for Student Govem-
ment president, is one consistent
opponent of the dissemination
rules. He feels that Meiser and
MDC “did not go far enough.”
Mamdani indicated that he be-
lieves the test period is “useless”
because no one may want to dis-
tribute anything during the per-
iod. And if literature is distri-
buted and if a disturbance is
caused, the policy would not be
amended thus penalizing all or-

ganizations because of the ac-.

tions of one group.
Mamdani and John Ruskay, for-

DINA NATALI, Father Pitt, is shown presentingllal welcome to fresh-
men women at the 46th annual Lantern Night ceremony. The event,

which took place Friday evening in the Commons Room, is the ‘‘old- -
est tradition for women at Pitt,” according to Harriet_Unga_r, chair--_

mer leader in the Pitt Progres-
sive Party, agreed that, though
communication of ideas should
be safeguarded, dorm residents
should be safe from intrusion
and disturbance. Without any
rules in effect on the dissemina-
tion of literature, such privacy
would not be assured. Both stu-
dents feel that rules can be made
which will insure privacy while
allowing distribution of litera-
ture to individual rooms.

The announcement of the rules
suspension. was made at the ﬁrst
fall‘ meeting of the MDC last
Thursday. The MDC Senate also

dealt with the establishment of

new rules for the awarding of
the Best Living Unit Award and
for a Judicial Board to handle
disciplinary cases in_ the dorms.

Alumni Lack
Initiative To
Support Pitt

Classes and schools of the Uni-
versity may ﬁnd themselves en-

gaged in friendly competition-

with each other in the next- few
years. The “struggle” will be‘
over which class or school can
produce the greatest alumni gifts.

Dr. David Kurtzman, acting
_chancellor,, suggested this as a
possibility in a recent interview
with The Pitt News. He explain-
ed that he felt that our alumni
giving has been ineffective in the
past. “Often we hear the excuse
that our school is a ‘streetcar uni-

versity,’ but that is no reason ,

why -our gifts should be so low.
We should ﬁnd it easier to get
contributions since. our alumni
are at our backdoor.”

' The University particularly
needs private support to pay for
movable equipment in new build-
ings such as the Hillman Library
and the Benedunm Engineering
Building. While the General State
Authority will pay for construc-
tion costs and any ﬁxed equip-
ment, it is up to the University
to ﬁnd funds for articles such as
desks, chairs and shelving.

Dr. Kur-tzmann emphasized that
the “extra quality” in University
planning will be ‘made possible
by private contributions. These
private contributions will include
not only _’ alumni support, but

The new rules for the Best
Living Unit Award eliminate
much of the vagueness of ._th
old rules, according to Meisner.:
In the calculation of points for
this year's award, the average
QPA of the house members 
be considered. Points will 
awarded for events in threeycat’
gories: athletic, cultural, 
ucational. To be considered for
the award, a house must have
at least 80 points in each of these
areas. , t "

The idea for a Judicial Board
originated last winter and Meisf
ner hopes that it will be opera
ing by the second term this ye‘
The idea has received prelimin
ary approval from Herbert Me'-
Gibbony, dean of men. The'b’oard‘
would have jurisdiction over a; 
disciplinary cases that arose fro"
violation of domitory rules. An
decisions and punitive measures
invoked by the board, short ‘of:
dismissal or suspension, would
be binding on students. The MDC'_sf

University Senior Leads

“Double Life” As Writer

By BERNI McLEOD

College ‘work is enough for
some people, but for 22 year
old University senior Den-
nis Casey, it is only one part
of a busy schedule as news-
paper reporter novelist, and

shortstory writer.

Casey, a transfer student from
J ohnstown College, is an English
writing major and a full-time
general assignment writer for the
Post-Gazette. While still at J ohns-
town,_ he worked on the Johns-
town-Tribute Democrat, and had
his ﬁrst two short-stories pub-
lished in Esquire and Playboy.

“Hemingway attend My Hem-
ingway Seminar,” a surrealistic

_, story of an English professor, ap-

peared in Esquire in 1964. His
second work, “Sound of Leaves,”
also dealing with college life, ap-
peared in Playboy the same year.

ed,” said Casey, “I can never
stand to look at it. I would rather
forget about the mistakes.”

Mistakes or not, Casey has won
a good deal of recognition for
his writing. In 1966, he was the
youngest person ever to win the
Pennsylvania Newspaper Publish-
ers Second Award for Campaign
or Crusade Series on Public Serv-
ice. At the time he was working
on the J ohnstown-Tribune Dem-
ocrat, and wrote his’ article on
poor housing conditions.

“I was gathering information
on the article during ﬁnals week
at college,” said Casey. “My in-
terviews for the paper, and my
ﬁnal exams were sandwiched in
between each other. After the
end of a week of absolutely no
sleep, I could just above move."

After leaving J ohnstown, Casey
could not keep far away from a

a paper, and now does drama re-

views for the Post-Gazette. “We
need more depth coverage in re-
viewing and reporting,” said Ca-

sey. “Papers should no longer as-

sume that most people have an
eighth grade education. ‘

“TV and radio are making deep
inroads into the news field,” he
added. “and papers ﬁnd it hard
to compete with their speed in
coverage. Papers should work on
news analysis. as we try to do at
the Post-Gazette.”

When he is not at the paper or
in class, Casey is working on a
novel, Of My Generation, which
he hopes to have published in
the near future.

As the lights came up on the

preoccupied with the years of

would catch another train, but
the Man, due to an incurable dis-

Under the ﬁne direction of Mar-

Trial Suspension

’ "(Edz'tor’s_Note: Mr. Meisner is

Pres. of Men’s Dormitory Council)
PROBLEMS INVOLVING
the presence of booths in the
Towers’ lobby and the dis-
tribution of literature in the
Towers’ lobby and on the
ﬂoors" above the lobby were
ﬁrst encountered during the
Spring trimester,’ 1965. Male
residents complained that
boothgh were too numerous in
the Towers’ lobby and that

lated by people who were
slipping literature under-
neath the doors of their
rooms. When these com-
plaints continued and in-
creased in the Fall term,
1965, action was taken. The
Towers’ Policy Committee of
Men’s Dormitory Council
,(MDC) initiated a policy for
setting up booths and distri-
-buting literature which was
approved by the Senate of
MDC. It set up guidelines for
Ztheuse of the public address,
system and bulletin boards
to publicize future events. It
set up regulations for booths.
Finally, it_ prohibited the dis-
tribution of literature either
in" the Towers’ lobby -or in
‘the living areas above the
lobby level.

' This policy was attacked
immediately as restricting
free speech. In the Winter

“term, 1966, after a long, hard

press their -views.

Committee was established
to deal with this, now, Uni-
}'_versity policy. A student
"subcommittee was formed.
"Its" members were: Ralph
Manning, president of Stu-
ent“ Government; Harvey
_. efton, last year’s president
of MDC; Dina Natali, chair-
_ an of Women’s Housing
Board; Marc Spiegel, SG co-
ordinator of University Or-
ganization and Events ; Mich-
ael Pagnotto, last year’s pres-
-ident pro-tempore of MDC;
’Ann.Baker, SG senator; and
myself, then president-elect
jjof MDC."The purpose -of this
(student subcommittee was to
examine the policy and to
hear both sides of the prob-
lem in order "to determine
whether or not the policy
actually did violate the free-
dom of speech. MDC explain-

. The temporary suspension of literature dissemination rules in the
.men’s dorms was a wise and cautious step. It is clear that the month trial
eriod will serve as a testing ground ' for future decisions on this subject.
.' V This newspaper has long stood behind the ideal of free dissemination
‘of literature in the men’s dormitories. There are no rules prohibiting such
istribution in the Women’s residence halls and therefore it seemed both
’over cautious and illogical to have such prohibitions in the mens’ areas.
 .A politically aware campus should not condone rules which hinder
. tudents interaction. On vital issues often the most effective way to spread-
opinion is toslip something under someone’s doors.
‘ _ While it is evident that such contact is desirable, there are salient
arguments against permitting such distribution. Men’s dormitories should
‘remain a quiet place for study, and constant disturbances from distribu-
ors should be avoided." But no one has really ever been able to say whether
;.this privilege would be constantly used and if used would disturbance occur.
 - With this trial period these questions will be answered. Pitt Pro-
gressive Party Chairman Mahmood Mamdani says they will not be settled.

F Towers Policy

By Thomas Meisner

that MDC ‘alone had juris-

diction over the men’s living

areas above the lobby ﬂoor

and that literature should

continue to be prohibited.
from being distributed there.

It also decided that, as a

corrective change, literature

should be permitted to be

distributed in the Towers’

lobby in order to enable the

effective dissemination of lit-

erature to the men. These

were the two decisions of the

Towers - Quadrangle’ student
subcommittee. The revised

policy was submitted to and

approved by the Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs and ‘is now in
effect as official University
policy. It also includes the
suspension of the policy dur-
ing the calendar week pre-
ceding Student Government
elections and’ the possibility
that other exceptions be
made. Its details were listed
in an article in The Pitt
News on Friday, March 25,
1966.

Immediately after the sub-
committee made its ﬁndings,
the Pitt Progressive Party
made a counter,-proposal that

would have permitted the’

distribution of literature in
the men’s living area. This
was obviously the exact op-
posite of the student subcom-
mitte’s conclusions and was
thus unacceptable.

The primary -reason that
the Towers policy was estab-
lished was to insure the pri-
vacy of the men in the dorms.
The present policy accom-
plishes this. A second impor-
tant reason for its establish-
ment was to contribute to
the security of the men’s
dorms. Obviously, nothing
can be done to completely se-
cure the dorm from all un-
wanted visitors, However,
the Towers policy eliminates
the possibility that someone
might enter the floors on the
pretext that he is going to
pass out literature.

THE THIRD reason for"
the Towers policygwas to pro-
vide for the effective distri-
bution of literature. » This
can be achieved by dissemin-
ating the literature in the
lobby of the Towers. This is
unhindered way to freely

pass out literature to the
men. This policy, therefore,
does not restrict free speech.
It enables any student“ or
any student group to stand
anywhere in the lobby, with-
out blocking the ﬂow of traf-
fic, and distribute literature
at any time of the day. By
this means every male resi-
dent can be reached. In ad-
dition, a table is available
and any organization may
put their publication on it.

The contention that the
Towers policy violates free
speech because it prohibts
dissemination above the lob-
by is not valid because liter-
ature can still be effectively
distributed to the men in the
lobby. Thus, in addition to
accomplishing its main goal,
insuring the men’s privacy,
the policy does not restrict
free speech. It actually ‘en-
courages it by providing for
booths, a literature table and
the dissemination of litera-
ture in the lobby.

The Towers policy was es-
tablished by MDC last year
in response to the expressed
wishes of the men it repre-
sented. It is a speciﬁc exam-
ple of MDC-’s general policy
of working to get what the
men want and need. We
must, however, know what
the men_actually want. Do

- the men want their privacy

insured or -don’t they? It
must be their decision. Due
to_ the relative newness of
this policy, the men should
be given the opportunity to
decide on it.

With this goal in mind,._
the regulation‘ that prohibits _

the distribution of literature
in the men’s living areas has
been suspended temporarily
for a trial basis of four
weeks. When this period is
over, the Dorm Council Sen-
ators will report how the

omen feel about the policy. If
‘ the men feel that their pri-

vacy has not been and is not

violated by literature being"

slipped underneath their

door, then the Senate may‘

act. It can also act if the men
want the policy retained.
Thus, the four week «trial
period will provide a fair ex-

amination of the Towers.

Cowell Defends
P Resolution

Editor, The Pitt News:

On Friday, Sept. 24, an editori-
al appeared in this newspaper
entitled: “Senators, Learn the
Facts.” The editorial went on to
point out what was wrong with
a bill introduced at the Student
Government (SG) meeting the
previous Tuesday evening. The
proposal introduced at the meet-
ing called upon SG to “urge the
Acting Chancellor, Governor
Scranton, and the Pennsylvania
state legislature to take the nec-
essary steps to consider and pass

H on measures that would. result in‘

a removal of the out-of-state as-
sessment and -the lowering of the
tuition paid by non-Pennsylvania
students.” The Pitt News editori-
al called this an “ill conceived
bill” and attempted _ to set us
straight on some of the —facts.
Unfortunately, the editor him-
self failed to ﬁnd out what the
facts really were before writing
this colunm. In fact, at the sa.me

time the editorial was being dis--

tributed Friday afternoon, the

editor and I were both attending.
a conference to “ﬁnd out what.

the facts really were.” This meet-
ing was with Dr. Bailee, assistant
to the Chancellor and in charge
of our state-relatedness affairs.

The editorial ﬁrst‘ contended
that the SG proposal should have
been directed to the Board of
Trustees. The bill, as introduced,
would have appealed to the
Chancellor,
the legislature. Dr. Bailee, during
the meeting, said it would not be
appropriate to send our plea di-
rectly to the Board of Trustees,
even though ‘it was they who
would ﬁnally act on it. Dr. Baileé
said that such‘ a proposal should
be sent to the Chancellor, as the
proposed bill would have done.
The Acting Chancellor would _be
the one who would carry the
proposal to the Board of .Trus-
‘tees. - _

Finally, the editorial proposes
that a reasonable ﬁrst step would
be the removal ‘of the laboratory
fees for out-of-state students.
This was not proposed in the SG

bill because it is not enough, ‘

First, this $15 or $25 lab fee is
insigniﬁcant in light of the over-
all expenditures incurred by the
out-of-stater. Secondly, too few
students would be ‘affected by
this since only a few students
ever incur the lab fee.

Thirdly, if this is to be -the ﬁrst
step, the later steps would be too
late to affect many of the non-

- Pennsylvanians attending Pitt

now, and tooplate to appeal to

prospective freshmen from out- »
of-_'stat, for next year. And'fourth-. , , ,

Letters to the Editor

the Governor, and’

He claims that perhaps no one will want ‘to use the privilege during the
next month and thus we will never know if once employed these privileges
will be abused. ' A

But if in the course. of a month not one student organization needs
to distribute literature, then this privilege could not be such a crucial stu-
dent right. There wouldlhave to be little student opinion desiring this
mode of expression.

The simple facts of the matter is that MDC”President Tom Meisner
formulated a sagecompromise. He said to those who oppose distribution,
“Let us try for a month and see if it will be as bad as you claim.”’ T 0 those
who wished the rules nullified he said, “You now have a chance to demon-
strate that you can employ these privileges with dignity and restraint.”

Meisner took the problem out of the realm of second guessing and is
giving the claims of ‘both sides some objective testing‘. We can only hope
that all organizations involved in this issue will have patience with this
problem and will recognize Meisneris decision as a rational first step.

told by an administrator that
this would probably be the ﬁrst
step when something is finally
done._ What is the use of propos-
ing something merely because
you have been told that it will
most likely come.about. And it
certainly does not make it the
most reasonable ﬁrst step. This
was, therefore, a useless proposi-
tion made by the editorial.

This Wednesday, Sept. 28, SG
passed substantially the same bill
“as that introduced ast week. The
facts in the proposal criticized by
the editorial were correct. The
“facts” of the editorial were in-
accurate. We.must intially ad-
dress our proposal to the Acting
‘Chancellor, as we ultimately do
cided to do. He will carry it to
the Board of Trustees. And it is
necessary to appeal to the Gov-
ernor and state legislature be-
cause they are ultimately respon-

sible for the ﬁnancial solvency of

this University and, at present,

the University was not receiving

any money that could compen-

sate for a reduction in payments

by non-Pennsylvanians.“

- Ronald Cowell
SG Senator, LA

 

EDITOR’S NOTE: Mr. Cowell’s

letter includes two ineorrect’state-
ments. The Governor and the
State Legislature are not “ulti-
mately responsible for the ﬁnan-
cial solvency of this University.”
Commenting on this ‘point Acting
Chancellor Dr. David Kurtzman
said, “Even in a. completely state-
ﬁnanced school, the state is not
responsible. If they suffer a. debt,
the -State does not ‘lhderwrite
them. The State, in our case, will
not underwrite anything but spe-
cial costs. It’s up to us to make up
our debts.” Clearly neither the
Governor nor the State Legisla-
ture is responsible for our ﬁ-
nances.

Mr. Colwell also said that “SG
passed substantially the same bin
35 that intfoduced last week.”
The bill was amended by Sena.-
tor Loren Hershey to include _a.
provision for‘ a. petition. The peti-
ti-on: Calling‘ for a. reduction in
our out-of-state fees, will be ch-.
culated among theistudent body

Frick Author  

Discusses Trial

Editor, The Pitt News:

A friend has sent .me a clip-
ping which contains the truly
amazing letter from David B.
Buerger in response to your
friendly column.

The= statem_ents made by Mr.
Buerger are so ridiculous as to
make it hard to understand a per-
son in his position could ‘have
written them. A

It is, of course, interesting to
me to ﬁnd that in some peculiar
way I appear to be associated
with dictatorship and the Big Lie
technique of rewriting history.
This deserves more explanation
on the part of the good attorney.
I gladly accept the challenge that
people read by book and judge
for themselves. I have yet to have
an unfavorable review of the
book or a statement from any
historical and indeed any layman
other than Mr. Buerger critical
of the rather gentle and some
what oblique references made to
Mr. Frick. Mr. Buerger himself
in Court objected to having sev-
eral noted historians testify on
my behalf on the ground my com-
petence and scholarship were not"
being challenged in Court. He
also objected to introducing as
evidence the statements of other
leading historians referring to
Mr. Frick.

Sincerely,

S. K. Stevens
Executive Director,
Pennsylvania Historical
and Museum Commission

UPTAppreciates
Series Response

Editor, The Pitt News: a,

We of ‘the UPT would like to
expresse our appreciation for the
enthusiastic response which our
new Friday night repertory series
is receiving. We regret that the

  

extremely limited seating capaci-
ty of our studio theatre has
forced us to turn away many peo-
ple; we are already scheduling as
many extra performances as pos-
sible and we hope to be able to
add more by. the winter trimes-
ter. In the meantime, however,
we can only suggest that people
buy their tickets as early as pos-
sible during the week of any par-
ticular performance.

Circumstances beyond our con-
trol make it impossible for us to
take advance‘ orders for Friday
Night Theatre productions, but
reservations are being accepted
now for our fall major, Web-
ster’s Duches of Malﬁ, which will
be performed from November 11
through November 19 in Stephen
Foster Memorial Auditorium. Fri-
day Night Theater weekly pre-
sentations,are announced in the
elevators, in The Pitt News, and
on the marquee outside Studio
Theater _1001 CL; and monthly
schedules are posted on bulletin
boards. We hope to expand our
program for providing the Uni-
versity community with quality
dramatic entertainment on a reg-
ular weekly basis.

Sincerely,
Wandalie Henshaw
Manager, Friday
Night Theater

Another Day

Panthers Frustrated by Errors, alifornia  

BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA—Frustration has enveloped the Pan-
thers. Following their opening game against UCLA, the locker room was
a scene of depression and shame. Following Duke, there was some hope.
Following California, Saturday, there was frustration.

There’s no joy in losing. But when you dont’ deserve to lose, you
wonder just what in the world you have to do to win. The locker room Sat-
urday reflected this mood.

The Panthers had outplayed a stubborn, but mediocre Cal team in
every department that counts, and still came out the losers, 30-15.

A scene in limbo. That’s the most apt
description of the post game festivities in
the locker room. All tempo was at half
speed. Nobody was talking. Some players
were crying. Dave Hart was sitting over in
one corner, munching mi apple, his head
bent, and not exactly in’ the -mood to say
much about anything. His aids were scat-
tered here and there. Some looked like they
had taken the loss even harder than the
players. _

Joe Jones summed it up best. All day
long he had lowered his head and used it
as a.‘ battering ram-, pounding into the Cal
defense. “What do wehave to do?” he ques-
tioned. Several hours earlier Joe lost half
of his back row of teeth. They had been
chipped by a tackle which should have been
penalized for piling on, but wasn’t.

Jones wasn’t the only player that suf-
fered. Jim Flanigan injured his knee in the

game from the sidelines. Both Dave Drake

Caught six passes _ mentarily in the ﬁrst half.

Andy Beamon was knocked cold. Bobby Dyer was collared and shaken.

Despite the lopsided physical tallies, the game was dominated by the
Panthers. They had 17 first downs to the Bears’ nine. They ran off 13
more plays than Cal. In the third quarter, Clal had the ball four times and
didn’t make one ﬁrst down.

Depth wise, material wise the Panthers aren’t the greatest team in
the country. They are ragged in too many spots, but they outclassed Cali-
fornia Saturday.

Cal cpach R.-ay Willsey begrudgingly admitted it with a “They gave
us a lot of concern. They don’t have the greatest players and they’re not
partilcularly deep, but they do play their fanny’s off, and they play intelli-
gen y.”

Willsey’s own team was slow. His much publicized quarterback, Dan
Berry, was molasses on hand-offs -and only managed six yards on nine
carries.

_ Hart was the winner all the way Saturday except for three little
things. One was a punt. One a pass. And another a fourth-and-one situ-

Booters Bow Before Busch,

Strong Michigan State 6

By MIKE BROURMAN .
EAST LANSING, MICH. ‘
—-Most coaches get a pained
look on their faces when one
of their players pulls a
“bush” play, but not Michi-

gan State soccer coach Gene Ken-
ney. He was all smiles on Satur-.
day as Guy Bush led the Spar-
tans to an easy 6-0 victory over
the soccer team.

Busch, an All-America player
from St. Louis, scored two goals
and set up three others to turn
what was expected to be a close
contest into a one-side affair.

At the beginning of the game,
it seemed as if the cold Michigan
air had cooled off State’s vaunted
offense. For the ﬁrst 20 rriinutes,
the booters kept State penned up
on their own side of the ﬁeld,
and dominated play.

Then Busch, took over. He sent
a perfect pass to sophomore Tony
Keyes, a 9.6 sprinter from Ja-
maica, and Keyes beat fullback
Bill Zurzola and slipped the ball
past goalie Lou Cepanec to give
Michigan State a 1-0 lead.

ation. All are simple fundamentals of football. Each one backﬁred in Cali-
fornia. Added together they accounted for 20 of the Bear’s 30 points.

In the ﬁrst quarter the Panthers took the kick-off and moved from
the 24 yard line to the 41 in five plays. On a second and five situation
Eddie James attempted his ﬁrst pass. He was looking for Bob Longo on
the quick sideline pattern. The ball never should have been thrown, but it
was and it was‘ intercepted by Wayne Stewart, who ran untouched into the
end zone.

The next mistake also came in the first quarter. It was a fourth and
one on the Panther 46 and Hart decided to go for it. The gamble didn’t pay
and Cal took the ball in for its second touchdown nine plays later. .

The punt was what broke the game open, however. At the end of the

third quarter it was 16-15, Cal. The offense was gathering momentum and c’

the defense looked better than it had all year.

Early in the fourth quarter Al Zortea punted away from his own 35.
Jerry Bradley fielded the 40 yard punt, quickly looked over the situation
and zipped upﬁeld 76 yards for a touchdown. That last mistake killed off
whatever the momentum the Panthers might have had.

“Up until then I thought we had them,”
said Hart. “Offensively we were moving.
But then that punt return broke our
backs.”

After that the game was all California.  .
The next time they had the ball, they went ‘
to the air for an icing TD. With only min- _.
utes remaining, the-Bears tried to‘ pile it "
on. They’re hungry out there for football
victories and the last minute of the game "
was one of the l_ongest ever played.

“They sure like to score points out here.
They get sort of hoggish. I sure hope I get
a chance to return the favor,” said Hart. .

Willsey, however,‘ defended that last
minute of play. “There are some times in
the season when you can tell you’re mov-
ing up. This was that time for us. I be-
lieve in winning. That’s all there is to it
and I'm disappointed that Dave would think
I tried to pile it on. I've had my can kicked
that way too. Now all we should be inter-
ested in is analyzing the game films.”  '  '

Well, the game films are being analyzed DEFENSE BACK BOB DYER
now. They should reveal, as Hart said after Made six tackles-
the game, “we won everything but the score.”

They should also reveal just what is breaking down on punt coverage.
For it was the second week in a mo wthat a punt return cost the game. And
neither of the runners that did it are comparable to what’s coming up in
the future—Nick Eddy and Floyd Little.

The Panthers have come a long way since fall camp and UCLA. Some
of the “new look” coaching is beginning to show. Just how much will be
seen when West Virginia plays in the,Stadium, Saturday.

V Dr. Michael Scriven discussed
—,-jpreliniinary views On “Insights
E and Understanding in Science” at
. .,the Philosophy of Science Lecture
Series last Tuesday night.

In an examination of the rela-
tion between knowledge and un-
 derstanding, Dr. Scriven disting-
“ uished two general approaches to
 the problem of understanding in
:7 science.

A A The Formalists believe that un-
derstanding is achieved by sub-
 sumption under general laws. The
—:__Intuitionists claim that some non-
-7,,forma1,__element_ is involved ‘such
L. as “reduction to the familiar,” or
; “provisions of a physical model.”
  The Intuitionists make refer-
j i  ence to psychological notions,
 '_ "while the Formalists have great
_ ’_ anxiety about subjectivity in sci-
;"‘~ ence. Dr. Scriven proposed to re-
:_;—'_f solve this -dispute by showing-
 _ that it is possible to give an ac-
 ‘count of understanding which re-
 tains the important insights of
 M the Intuitionists, yet is objective.
 The Formalist paradigm is an im-
 portant special case, “peculiarly

 sumption is only one process in *

the process of interaction between
experience and language.” Such
programs “enable the computer
to use background knowledge as

part of the basis for translation,”
but computers are unable to dis-
tinguish between language and
experience. i

According to Dr. Scriv~en’s the-
ory, understanding is tied to
knowing items in a ﬁeld. The no-
tion of models is crucial. Model-
ing is the key to economical stor-
age of information. Understand-
ing is more important than know-
ing since the former involves eco-

to new problems.

Carl G. Hempe1’s thesis of the
logical symmetry of scientiﬁc ex-
planation and prediction has been
a disputed issue in the philoso-
phy of science for ..several years.
Professor Scriven, a noted anti-
symmetrist, presented several al-
leged counter-examples to Hem-
pel’s thesis.

Scriven believes we can have’

understanding which does not
generate predictions. He empha-
sized that his account of explana-
tion was contextual not psycholo-
gistic. The concept of knowledge
is crucial to the entire complex
of issues presented.

honor, WTAE Radio has selected
Dr. Kurtzman this week as their

moon shot. In India, installing a nu-
clear ‘power plant. Or in a labora-
tory, looking for applications _for a
new silicone membrane that lets la
submerged man breathe oxygen di-
rectly..from the water around him.
This is a worldwide company
that's helping to change the world.

And that's changing with it. Well
overhalf of the 250,000 products
General Electric makes today didn't
exist ten years ago!

If you think you have what it takes
to play a key role in one of the im-
portant fields of your time, talk to
the man from General Electric.

We'll make our first 2000 together.
