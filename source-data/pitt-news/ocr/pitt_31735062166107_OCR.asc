a feather in the cap of Irv Roth.-
man, Ed. ’57. Rothman, who is
presently a staff columnist for the
paper, served as its editor for
theschool year 1955-56. He also
received All-American honors for
the fall semester last year.

At the close of each semester,
all issues are sent to the ACP
Critical ‘Service. Professional
journalists then examine and
evaluate the paper under the
category of News Cover e.
Quality of Content, and Physical
Properties. Once again, the
Pitt News received top rank-
ing in all three fields.

Pitt is one of only ﬁve schools
of over 500 students who publish
two or three papers weekly to
receive All-American for the past
semester. All told, a total of 395
colleges and universities had their
newspapers rated under various
' groupings.

12th FLOOR SPEAKER

The Honorary Steward of
Canterbury Cathedral, England,
Miss Babington, will speak at a
tea today in the Vira Heinz
Room, 3:30 p.m. A noted lec-
turer, Miss Babington will talk
and show slides on “The Ro-
mance of Canterbury Cathe-

invited.

Since 1948, the Pitt News has
missed the All-American only
three times, and then by few
points, ﬁnishing with ﬁrst honors.

The ACP sends each entrant
a score book in which judges
evaluate numerically various
newspaper practices. Speciﬁc
comments are made with refer-
ence ‘to certain issues of the pa-
per.

Gaining particular outstanding
comment was the issue last April
which contained exclusive inter-
view stories of Dr. Charles H.

tained by Rothman, who ﬂew to
Peake’s home in Illinois shortly
after the assistant chancellor was
appointed.

Tailspinning Tailwagger Tells Tale

By mv JACOBS ‘

Abert, a popular ﬁgure in
department,

the biophyhics
is resting quietly this week
after a dangerous experience.

Observers reported that the
well known contributor in the

department had a narrow escape
from death on Sunday when he
was involved in “an experiment
of great gravity.”

Though Albert is not often seen
around the lab, it is a well-known
fact that he expends much energy
in experimental efforts -— and
generally works alone. This fact
would ordinarily explainrwhy Al-
bert happened to be spending his
week-end at Thaw Hall — ex-
cept that Albert happens to be a
dog. ‘

In spite of this drawback, ac-
cording to his master, Albert
maintains a very keen interest in
the physical world. All his traits
are indicative of a sober, intellec-
tual personality. In fact his sole-
ful eyes, high forehead, and lean
body have earned him his dis-
tinctive name, in honor of “an-
other great person of learning.”

Indeed, scientiﬁc zeal appears
to be a trademark in the fam-
ily. His master, a biophysics
grad student at Pitt, is report-
edly so devoted to Albert’s
namesake that he “wears sweat-
shirts all the time.”

Anyway, last Sunday A1bert’s
master brought the year-old dog

Council To Discuss
Honor System Plans

The Council of Scholastic Organizations will act on re-
ports by its recently-appointed committee chairmen at its
meeting" today at 3:30 p.m. in 805 C1. Mil Fastuca, Col. ’57,
will report on the activities of the Honor System Investigat-
ing Committee and Lois Wise, Ed. ’57, will present the plans

of the Program Committee.

The Honor System question has¢

so far eluded a successful solu-
tion. According to Council Presi-
dent Jack Olender, Col. ’57, an
honor system is of great concern
to CSO. He stated, “We must ex-
amine any such proposal very
carefully so as not to overlook
any detrimental effects.

“Perhaps an objective analysis

Ron Sobel, Col. ’57, reaffirmed
that “election to Men’s Council

in this vein at the Men’s Council
meeting on Wednesday, Oct. 25.
Bob Barrickman, Col. ’57, dis-
cussed formation of a committee
of three to investigate the check-
cash system sponsored by Men’s
Council. Bob Musik, Eng. ’58, is
the other member of MC on the

Phil Parkinson, Col. ’58, chair-
man of freshman interest com-
mittee, reported on the success
of the men’s conference dinner.
Jim Marino, Col. ’58, chairman
of blazer committee, stated that
he and Gladys Flesher, Col. ’58,
are considering the possibility of
buying Pitt Blazers for men and
women from a Pittsburgh ﬁrm.
MC members discussed their
recent retreat. Barrickman spoke
of the necessity of having more
functions of this type. Bob Men-
delson, Bus Ad ’59, and Art Bloom,
Bus Ad ’59, received the com-
mendation of the group for their
help in planning the retreat.
Jim Marino moved that mem-

 

ment of the University popula-

body of 14 honorary societies on
campus.

CSO’s ﬁrst program of the year

5, when radiation and its effects
on human physiology and genetics
will be discussed by members of
the University faculty. Represent-
ed on the speakers’ platform will
be the ﬁelds of biological science,
physical science, and radiation
measurement. ’

A project of CS0 which would
be directly concerned with that
body alone is that of an alumni
ﬁle. Secretary of the group,
Mary Cain, Col. ’57, will present
a report at the meeting on the
progress of this endeavor. Such

the names of all the alumni of

favorably as the members felt
that such a get-together would
add to the homogeneity of the

A motion was presented before
council that a homemaking class
for men be established. Examples
were cited of skills that might be
acquired which could prove valu-

lleinz Chapel Choir Cuts High Fidelity Records

Two Dist:-s__ Made
As Substitute for

H Annual April Trip .

By SUSAN GOTTERER

A few choir members “miss-
ed the bus” last April while
cuting two records. They
were locked out of the Heinz
Chapel at the time the record-
ing was to start. The records

were made as a substitute for the
spring trip that the choir cus-
tomarily takes.

The records, except the song

9"

* ‘'‘Masters in this Hall,” were re-

‘corded with an Ampex Tape Re-
corder at 30 feet per second, thus
securing the utmost in high ﬁdel-
ity. Three microphones were used
to achieve not only the resonance
of the Chapel but also the quality
of “presence” which makes the
listener feel that the choir is right
there.
Price We Pay

‘According _to Theodore M. Fin-
ney, director of the choir, “any
inadverdent growlings or any
‘solos’ other than those which had
been planned are the price we

‘‘»,»pay for fidelity and presence.”

The recording of “Beautiful
Savior” was a beautiful piece of
work until the woodwork snapped
in the middle of the recording.
This noise was .recorded loudly
and clearly, and the recording had
to be thrown away and done over
again.

’. Several times during the re-

cordings people rattled the doors

of the Chapel, not realizing that
they were locked for a purpose.

Harry A. Overstreet, author
of “The Mature Mind,” and his
wife will hold a colloquy on
the stage of Soldiers and Sail-
Tors Memorial Hall tomorrow at
8 p.m. The topic will be “What
‘Emotional Health Looks Like.”

Dr. Overstreet is probably
best known for his book “The
‘Mature Mind,” which has been
on the best seller list for the
past two years.

. The meeting, ‘sponsored by
the Mental Health Society of

chiatric Society, is free and

open to the public.

Joan Hendrickson, Bus. Ad. ’58; Joanne Hochberg, Ed. ’57, and

Marigrace Satryan, Col. ’58.
O '0 O
This noise spoiled the pieces and
they had to be repeated.

The ﬁrst record was recorded
in the ‘Chapel. Anna Mae Motto
was the solo soprano in “Sing
Praises to God” and “Lost in the
Night” on the ﬁrst side. The sec-
ond side included a solo bass by
Harry Gold in “Guide Me and
Lead Me.” A

Record With Ampex

“Prayer,” “Hail. Gladdening
Light,” and “Open our Eyes,” the
ﬁrst side of the second record,
were recorded in the Chapel with
the Ampex machine. and three
microphones. Harry Gold was the
soloist in “Open our Eyes.”

“Masters in this Hall,” also on
this side, is from the sound-track
of the ﬁlm which the choir made
for the H. J. Heinz Co. in Novem-
ber, 1955. The recording was done
by Mode-Art Pictures, Inc., with
one microphone on 35 mm film
track at the WENS studio on Troy
Hill.

Dr. Finney said that this
sound track, transferred to mag-
netic tape, was made available
by Mr. Arthur Dimond, Adver-
tising Manager of the H. J.
Heinz Co. M

“There is a difference in-re-
sonance and presence between
this record and the ones made in

rents in Summer” was recorded
with the Ampex and threelmicro-
phones. The other music on this
side was recorded with a Magne-
cord Tape Recorder travelling at
seven and a half feet per second,
with one microphone.
Solo and Trio

Sally Johnson was the solo con-

tralto in “Beautiful Savior.” The

solo bass near the beginning of
“Trial Before Pilate” in the
Easter Trillogy was Harry Gold.
The short trio near the middle
of “Cruciﬁxion” was sung by Anna '
Mae Motto, soprano; Marigrace,
Satryan, contralto; and Arthur

The choir spent two days mak-
ing the recordings in April. On

absence, his‘ master impatiently
lookedout the window and saw
poor Albert lying dazed on the
sodded ground below.

In the hysterical ordeal that
followed, there was much chatter
and concern throughout the lab
over A1bert‘s recovery. Talk was
primarily over what could pos-
sibly have caused Albert to do
such an unusual thing. Of course,
there were the skeptics (and jeal-
ous collie-gues) who insisted that
Albert had merely gone over in
search of a ﬁre plug. But Albert’s
followers justified ‘everything.

“Albert is a very skeptical
dog,” one observed. “He just
didn’t accept the notion of grav-
itation, and he went out to prove
Newton’s theory to himself.”
Another offered the alibi that
“Albert simply wanted to see
if the Wright brothers were
right.” ,

Anyhow, “Everybody loves Al-
bert” as his master claims. Sens-
ing that Albert was sick as a dog.
the entire department got to-
gether and jointly sent him a
large get-well card.

i“Biophysicists are great hu-
manitarians,” one of the grad
students explained. “When any-
one falls off a roof, we always
send him a card.”

Albert ' since has been ‘resting
quietly. His master explained that

I The Banal} Ovation

Pitt’s 120-piece marching band added another feather to
their caps a week ago Saturday when they performed before
the Oyster Bowl crowd at Norfolk, Virginia. The varsity
organization received a standing ovation from the crowd of
28,000 after their half—time presentation based on the musical
drama, “The King and I.” The enthusiastic reception, which

‘started even before half—time ceremonies, was marked by

cheers and compliments from the Duke crowd during the
band’s four—mile parade to the stadium. Local newspapers
(the Virginian-Pilot and Portsmouth Star) printed state-

.ments resembling those made by the Southern newspapers

after the Sugar Bowl contest. Said the Pilot:
‘ “A surprise success at the game itself was the natty,
precise 120-member University of Pittsburgh marching

band, the largest such group ever to play in Foreman
Field and,’ according to many listeners, also the best.”

The University of Pittsburgh has plenty of reason to

feel proud after being represented by this organization in

such a ﬁne manner. This is to say nothing of the equally fine
work done by the football team.

The band’s reception stands out as an even greater ac-
complishment when it is considered that Pitt’s show was
just one among many. There was the Duke band, Shriner
band, ﬂoat parade, and queen. For Pitt to stand out so con-
spicuously amid all this pomp is even more remarkable.

The band has proven itself one of the best in the de-
partment of public relations for the University. They should
be given every opportunity to show their worth.

Forbidden Neighbors

By Irv Rothmon

Most writers agree with columnist Walter Lipp-
man’s views that this election is not a race be-
tween two parties, but_ between a ‘party’s program
and a man’s persona1ity—the Democratic party
against Dwight Eisenhower.

But if, for some unfortunate circumstance, Ike

is unable to complete his term of office if elected,‘

we must realize that Richard
Nixon will assume executive,
leadership. In view of Mr. Nix-
on’s past record, he will not
support those principles of Eisen-
hower which provide the back-
bone of the Republican cam-
paign.

ljjxon Antithesis

If Ike, himself, stands for the
welfare of all the people, fair .- 
play, and personal equality, then Mr. Nixon 1s hlS
anthithesis.

Nixon voted in 1950 for the McConnell Amend-
ment of FEPC, a decision which ultimately pre-
vented any possibility of passage of a Federal FEPC
with teeth; in 1952 he voted for the discriminatory
Walter-McCarran Immigration Act.

But, while such politics often result from ex-
pediency, a man’s true character may bepfound
in his home life. And\Nixon‘s minority prejudices
are profoundly acknowledged by the noted authori-
ty on housing problems of minority groups Charles
Adams. .

Forbidden Neighbors ~

In his book Forbidden Neighbors, published in
1955, Adams writes, “The Republican candidate
(1952), Richard M. Nixon of California . . . and
his wife co-executed an agreement that the house
they bought would never be sold or rented to ‘any
person or persons of negro blood or extraction or
to any person of the Semitic Race, bloor or origin,
which racial description shall be deemed to in-
clude Armenians, Jews, Hebrews, Persians and
Syrians.”

Mr. Nixon’s prime example of political subter-
fuge occupied in his 1946 Congressional race
against Jerry Voorhis, a New Dealer. Although
nothing Voorhis had ever done could be termed
in any way Communistic, Mr. _Nixon labeled him
a Communist. Voters in the district received an-
nonymous phone calls prior to the election telling
them that friends were calling andthat Jerry
Voorhis was a Red.

Gahagan Inference

In his 1950 Senate race against Helen Gahagan
Douglas, Nixon compared her vote on liberal is-
sues with the record of a known northern Com-

.munist, also a Senator, and so, by inference, labeled

her a Communist.

As for the issues, we agree with political writer
Richard Rovere who wrote of Nixon in the Sep-
tember 1955 issue of Harper’s magazine, trying
to determine what followers found favorable about
Nixon, “It cannot be his views, for they are in-
determinate and perhaps non—existent. It cannot
be what he has accomplished,’ for what he has ac-
complished is wholly in the realm of maneuver . . .”

Here’s the way Nixon voted in the last eight
years: for Taft-Hartley, for anti-labor Wood Bill,
for Lucas Bill which weakened both coverage and
enforcement of minimum wage laws.

He voted to give away federal off-shore oil;
to retain the Senate ﬁlibuster rule, against public
reclamation and power projects.

Republicans Gain Strength

By Harold Jacobs
Adlai E. Stevenson must be a very f1‘uS1I‘1.3ted
man these days. He is the world’s most popular

_.“egghead,” but intellect alone cannot manufacture

the strong rallying point needed to set off the Dem,-
ocratic ,“ﬁrecracker.”

Ike seems to have countered every Democrat-
raised issue with rebuffs that thwart the Democrats
and strengthen the Republicans.
The underdog has gotten off the
ﬁoor more than once to step _:
into the winner’s circle, but this,
just doesn't seem to be poor Ad :
lai’s year. His ammunition falls
on opponents, who can give as ‘
well as take, and a four year rec
ord comes out even stronger aft-
er the interchange.

Let us cite a few exampes..

Stevenson charged that the Eisenhower Adm1stra- H

tion coddled Peron in Argentina only to withdraw
from the charge after conﬂicting testimony from Dr.
Milton Eisenhower and othersiproved its falsity.
Heavy Attack

The Democrats leveled a heavy attack on’the
Republican farm program; the result two weeks be-

 

*5"

  

fore election, as pointed out in N ewsweek’s Listen-"‘~.'r‘

ing Post (Oct. 29), shows Ike ahead of Adlai in all
key farm states except Missouri, and even here‘
“Stevenson’s campaign drive is clearly losing ef-
fectiveness.” _

Stevenson's recent sweeping proposals to cut the
draft and stop hydrogen bomb tests appeartn have
backﬁred. The Listening/Post (Oct. 29) reports that
Adlai’s suggestion that the draft be ended has met‘
stone wall" opposition among a cross section of
American voters, with opposition running about 6
to 1. The hydrogen bomb issue has further added to
his unpopularity. the overall reaction running~al-
most 21/; to 1 against the proposal. The conclusion:
American people just aren’t buying political ideal-
ism wrapped up in unreaiities.

Even the minds of laborers are not wholeheart-.
edly conforming to the Democratic line, as there
are indications that they would rather exercise their

.-4“

“independent judgment than be told how to vote by’ »

the pro-Democratic labor leadership” (Newsweek,
Oct. 22). In addition, wives of laborers tend to
favor amiable Ike.

0 Sound Foundation

Results such as those cited do not just happen.
Republican strength is based on a sound founda-
tion, which may be demonstrated by analyzing a
few aspects of our present prosperity. Taking the
1947-1949 average retail price level as 100, we can
compare the raises in retail prices under the two
Administrations. From 147 to 1948 the jump was
from 95.5 to 102.8, from 1948 to 1951 from 102.8 to
111.0, from 1951 to 1953 11.0 to 114.4, and from

1953, when Eisenhower took office, from‘1l4.4 

114.8 in 1954 down to 114.5 in 1955. A measure of
stability has been introduced. (Arthur Larson’s
(A Republican Looks At His Party). ‘

In spite of the sharp attacks on Secretary of
Agriculture Benson, the farmers, as indicated above,
are still backing Ike. The rigid price support pro-

gram of the Truman Administration has been ex- >

posed for its two evils, huge surpluses and an un-
sound agriculture. Emerging from these mistakes
is a policy which rests on a ﬂexible adaptation of
price supports to production needs, a much wiser
and more stable approach to the problems of the
farmer and the nation. ' , 2

Letters to the Editor

Editor, the Pitt News:

Most people think they must
vote for either the Republican
or Democratic parties. I stand
for a third way: the Socialist
party. Today the United States
is prosperous, but it’s a false
prosperity. It’s false because it’s
based upon production of war
products instead of production
for use. The United States could
be using this national wealth
-for the purpose of ﬁghting pov-
erty and ignorance in the United
States instead of wasting it in
military hardware. Russian com-
munism is the foe of every
American, including the Social-
ists, but we feel that the best
way to ﬁght this communism is
not to ally the United States
with the most reactionary ele-
ments in foreign countries, ele-
ments which are hated and de-
spised by their own people, but
instead to make the cause of de-

The Francos come and go but

ford to ally ourselves to those

to understand this. In the ﬁeld

  Chest Sets Year’s   Goal;
Drive Aims for $3,500

By MURRAY A. CHASS
In 1947 Student Congress realized that the students at
Pitt had an obligation to aid those who were less fortunate
" than themselves——both students and non-students, locally
and the world over. At the time SC felt that to fulﬁll this

obligation, one united drive,

rather than individual cam-

paigns, would be more efﬁcient and less complicated.»

Thus, the Pitt Chest was born:

Now in its tenth year, the Chest
is going all out to bring in its
biggest total to date. The goal that
has been set is $3500. Of course,

V to attain this, the average contri-

bution by each student will have

‘ , to be considerably more than the
 T“ 955 per capita donation of $ .56.

The Student-Faculty Commit-
tee, which is in charge of allo-
cating the funds received
through the drive, has divided
the eventual "total into three
groups: 1) World University
Service; 2) Pitt student fund;
and 3) Community fund.

Included with the World Uni-
versity Service is the National
Scholarship Service for Negro
Students. However, separate tal-

? lotments have been made to these

/

two. WUS will receive 25 per
cent and the Scholarship Service

‘ «has been promised seven per cent.

The largest proportion has
been set aside for the Men’s
Council and the Women’s Self

Government Association Loan
Funds of the University. All
told, they will get 35 per cent.

The remaining money, 33 per
cent, will be divided_ among the
United Fund of Allegheny Coun-
ty, the National Polio Fund, and
CARE. '

In the next issue, the World
University Service will be dis-
cussed. 7

CURRENT DEBATE

professor’ of economics, will

States should discontinue for-
eign aid” before Women’s
Speech Association Oct. 30.

STUDYING CAN BE BEAUTIFUL

Is studying bugging you? Do you have trouble re-
membering names, dates, facts, ﬁgures, and the location
of the library? Dear friends, it need not be so. All you
have to do is master the simple art of mnemonics.

Mnemonics, as we all know, was invented by the great
Greek philosopher Mnemon in 526 B.C. Mnemonics, in-
cidentally, was only one of the many inventions of this
fertile Athenian. He is‘ perhaps best known for his in-
vention of the staircase, which, as you may imagine, was
of inestimable value to mankind. Before the staircase,
people who wished to go from floor to ﬂoor had to leap
from springboards. This meant, of course, that aged and
inﬁrm persons were forced to live out their lives, willy-
nilly, on the ground floor, and many of them grew cross
as bears. Especially Demosthenes, who was elected con-
sul of Athens three times but never served because he
was unable to get up to the office of the commissioner
of oaths on the third ﬂoor to be sworn in.

But after Mnemon’s staircase was invented, Demos-
thenes got up to the third ﬂoor easy as pie and took the
oath-—to Athens’ sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes,
his temper shortened by years of conﬁnement to the
ground floor, soon embroiled his countrymen in a series of
senseless and costly wars with the Persians, the Visigoths,
and the Ogallala Sioux. He was voted out of oﬂice in
517 B;C., and Mnemon, who had made his accession pos-
sible, was pelted to death with fruit salad in the Duomo.

 

But I digress. We were discussing mnemonics, which
nothing more than aids to memory — catchwoi-ds' or
jingles that help you to remember names, dates, and
places. For example, any student of American history

' -surely knows the little jingle:

Columbus sailed» the ocean blue
In fourteen hundred ninety two.

You see how simple a mnemonic is? There is no rea-
son why you can't make up your own. Say, for instance,
that you are proceeding with American history.

The Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock
In sixteen hundred twenty, doc.
(This jingle is especially useful to medical students.)
The next important event is the Boston Tea Party.
Let us compose a rough-and-ready couplet about that:
Samuel Adams ﬂung the tea
Into the bring Zuyder Zee.

You can -see how simple and useful they are — not
only for history, but also for current events. For instance,

In nineteen hundred fifty six
It’s the cigarette that clicks!

‘What, you ask, is the cigarette that clicks? Why,

No! A thundering, thumping, resounding no! Get some

@Max Shulman, 1956

Cost Sparks Win
With Timely Gains

By ED KOLTISKA

All indications pointed to an .

open game against Oregon,
based on last week’s showing
against Duke. Coach John
Michelosen crossed the ex-

pected, however, and relied

on his noted power series "to take
the Ducks into camp, 14-7, last
Saturday at the Stadium.

It took the Panthers the first
two quarters and part of the third
before they could get the Web-
foots within gun sight for the
ﬁnal shot.

A crowd _of 36,872 fans fought
cool breezes and were woed as
they watched the Jungle Cats and
the Ducks spar to a 0-0 tie the
ﬁrst half. .,

Cost Leads Drive

The Oaklanders started rolling
in the third quarter after Oregon
missed a ﬁeld goal from 30 yards
out. Taking over’ on their own
20-yard line, Corny Salvaterra
spearheaded an 80-yard drive for
a touchdown. R ‘

Corky Cost on a. pitchout
picked up six yards over right
tackle. On the very same play
Cost again broke into the open
and raced down to the Oregon
48-yard line for a 26 yard gain.

Hard running by Jim Theodore,
Cost and Salvaterra brought the
ball to the Ducks one-yard line.
Theodore then carried over left
tackle for the score.

Salvaterra Finds Walton

Four minutes later, the Pan-
thers were headed for their sec-
ond touchdown. The Ducks,
known for their hospitality in

‘prior games, were upholding the

tradition when Tom Crabtree

"fumbled a punt return on the

Webfoot 42 after being hit by the
charging Blue and Gold forward
wall. Ed-Michaels recovered for
the Jungle Cats.

Salvaterra, operating at quar-
terback. lofted a 24-yard pass
to Cost on the 34-yard line. Cost
rambled to the Ducks’ 17-yard
marker.

On the next three plays, the‘
Oaklanders were held to eight
yards. With fourth down and one
yard to go, Joe Walton fought oﬂ’
an Oregon defender and made a
diving catch of Salvaterra’s pass

Shanley Makes Longest Gain

Bugs Bagamery converted after
both touchdowns to make the
score 14-0 with 13 minutes re-
maining in the game.

Oregon’s tally came late in the
last quarter. With a fourth down
and seven situation at midﬁeld

ley on the Oregon twelve.

straight

The Panthe is, who now have won just one game and tied

another outiof ﬁve, played on an:

even basis with the Middies for

.two quarters and part of the third;

but the Navy attack blew, the
game wide open with a pair of
goals in each ‘of the last two
periods.

Middie captain Jim O’Conne1l
led the ‘scoring parade with two
markers from his center half post.

O’Connell started the Navy scor-.

ing in the opening quarter on a

_ kick from 20 yards out, and then

in the third stanza hit on a 25-
yarder.

Kane Scores Only ‘Goal

Chuck Kane, outside left, kept
the locals in the game by scoring
early in the third quarter. It was
the sophomore’s second tally of
the season.

The winning goal was chalked
up by the inside left lineman,
Mike Wood-
bury. Guil-
lernio ' Z a r i-
quiey, junior
from Peru,
and Dick An-
derson crush- -.
ed what hope  —
the Panthers » '
had left with Bressanelli
their fourth period scores.

Hugo Marxer, outstanding Navy
goalie, continued his stinginess as
Kane’s goal was only the second
scored while Marxer has ‘been in
the cage. Marxer was aided both
by a fast defense and a ﬁne pass-
the offense.

Middies Were Fast

The ball-control of the Middies
was the biggest factor in stopping
the Panthers. It enabled the-hosts
to move the ball within easy
shooting range of the Panther
cage, and their continuous passing
had the Oaklanders tired out by
the end of the game.

    

A dejected Leo Bemis com-
mented after the game, “We
could not get the ball 'moving
or get in close for decent shots,
and our defense couldn’t clear
the ball fast enough. Navy has
a good team, make no mistake
about’that. They weren’t as fast
as in past year, but their passing

A

more than made up for it. It was
just like watching a basketball
game on a soccer ﬁeld.”

Bemis made one switch in his

Frosh Tie Rockets

While the varsity is having a
rough time getting back on the
ri-ght foot, the freshman squad.
has been picking up some invalu-
able experience of its own.

Last week the freshmen were
nosed out by an excellent Shady
.Side Academy team, 2-1. Edin
Ferrer, a Panther import from
Venezuela, scored the Blue and
Gold’s lone goal on a penalty
kick. ‘
Ferrer was also the star in an
earlier meet against the Slippery
Rock junior varsity, which ended
in a 2-2 deadlock. Going into the
ﬁnal ﬁve minutes, the more “ex-
perienced Rockets (Slippery Rock
has no regular frosh team. Instead,
freshmen and a few varsity men
make up the jayvee squad.) had a
2-0 lead. Ferrer then booted in
two successive tallies tossalvageg
the tie. '

The yearlingsnext game is this
Thursday against he ' ‘Western
Pennsylvania School for the Deaf.

i Defies Gridders 1’

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

A A A

Sports Editor

Coach John Michelosen’s gridders will attempt to do
what no other Panther football team has been able to do
in eight tries when they play Minnesota Saturday—that’s
come up with a victory over the Golden Gophers. Even

when the Blue and Gold was enjoying its greatest grid era back in
the 1930’s, they failed to defeat the Big Ten power.

In fact, the Oaklanders would have had undefeated campaigns in
both 1933 and 1934 had they been able to handle the Midwesterners.

.However, they bowed 7-3 in 1933 and 13-7 in 1934 to deprive Jock

Southerland of consecutive undefeated seasons. The other six scores

were one—sided Minnesota wins which only the mention of is sicken-

This week, though, the locals appear to be in the ideal position
to upset the Big Ten team. The Oaklanders played a middling game
against the Oregon Ducks Saturday. The “new look” offense, discov-
ered in the Duke encounter the previous week, failed to materialize
in the Webfoot tilt. Perhaps Michelosen felt it better to hold the
offense under wraps for Minnesota, although he stated this was not

the case.

Michelosen was far from pleased with the showing against Ore-
gon, while the Duke’s coach, "Len Casanova, said, “A few mental
. lapses cost us greatly, and our downﬁeld blocking was not what it
should have been. All in all we played a good game, though.”

The mediocre Panther performance can probably be-traced to
. form more than anything else. The locals seem to come up with top-

“notch performances on alternate weekends, and this is the weekend
that the schedule calls for a great showing. Another favorable factor
is Minnesota’s surprising 20-6 defeat of mighty Michigan Saturday.

The Gopher triumph over the Wolverines will undoubtedly put
them at psychological disadvantage going into the Panther affair.
The least they can do is suffer a letdown; the least the Blue and Gold

can do is get up again.

“Getting up” again will in all probability depend on quarter-
back Corny Salvaterra. The senior signal—caller from Wilkes—Barre
played another commendable game against Oregon. Corny engineered
an 80 yard march for the ﬁrst touchdown and passed nine yards to
Joe Walton for the other six-pointer. V I

The other ﬁeld generals——Darre1l Lewis and Bill Kaliden——found
the Duck defense not to their liking as they could not get any worth-

while drives started.

Thus, Salvaterra has shown in the last two games that the
‘_\,_,-Panther chances of victory hinge on his having a good day. If Sal
is on, the Panthers usually win; if Sal is off, the Panthers usually
lose. Even if Corny is on against Minnesota it’s going to be a tough-
one. They must crack the Minnesota jinx.

Almost -'I'_i—e(l Mark

As Freshman Ace

By SAM HARTSOCK
Coach Carl Olson’s track

and cross-country teams have
made their second contribu-
tion to the “jet -age.”

First it was Arnie Sowell;

‘now Olson gives the track

world sophomore Vince Timon
who is regarded by many as cap-
able of becoming the fastest dis-
tance runner the Panthers have
ever had.

Timon

achieved one of his

greatest accomplishments recent- I

ly in a triangular cross-country
meet with Villanova and Navy.
In that four—mile race, Vince ﬁn-
ished only a step behind the
fabulous Ron Delaney of Villanova
fame.
Olson Acclaims Vince

Delaney, who will be Ireland’s
representative in the Olympics, is
one of the few to have run the
mile under four minutes. In the
coming Olympic games, Delaney
will enter the 800 and 1500 meter
events.

Commenting brieﬂy on the close
race between the two in the three-
way meet, Coach Olson said:
“Timon certainly gave Delaney
all he could go for.”

Vince began his cross-country
and track career as a sophomore
at Cathedral Prep in Erie. In his

Timon ran the course of slightly

caused by the fact that after the

competition.

Following Timon to the ﬁn-
ish line was Buckeye ace John
Blackburn. Blackburn and

ﬁnished fourth, stayed close be-

to fall back, as the ﬂashy Pan-

ing two miles alone.

Finishing in third place, be-
tween Blackburn and Bartel, was
John Christof, a sophomore from
Shaler Township. Christof, who
has improved with every meet
this season, perhaps has been
Coach Olson’s biggest and most
pleasant surprise.

sixth places respectively, were

Ireland’s Delaney
Barely Beat Vince

In Recent Classic

In high school track, Vince
ran the mile for three years,
and the half-mile in his ﬁnal
season. His most notable
achievement in the mile came in
his senior year when he won the
Catholic State meet with a time
of 4:28. That same season, he
also won the City meet for the
half-mile with a fast 2:03.

Entering the University of Pitta-
burgh last year, Vince ran both
cross country and the two-mi“e
event in track for the freshmln
team. Late in the cross country
season, he turned in his best per-
formance when he came within
two seconds of tying the ,_,cour.'-e
record in Schenley Park.

Tops Varsity Runners

In track last year, Vince en-
tered only one two-mile race,
that against the Penn State frosh.
He was clocked in the event at
9:43, a time which is faster than
those turned in by the Panther
varsity.

Oddly enough, Vince comes to
the Panthers at a time ~ when
Coach Olson’s hopes for victory
had been dimmed by the loss of
Arnie Sowell, the Blue and Gold’s
outstanding Olympic star.

Now, however, with Timon, the
Panthers not only have a chance
to keep winning; but they also
have great potential to remain in

the national track limelight.
