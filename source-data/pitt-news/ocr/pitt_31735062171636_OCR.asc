Board Approves

Forbes ’ Candidacy

In the first contest in the up-
coming Student Government <SGl
elections. the University Review
Board (URBl overturned a deci-
sion by the Student Government
Elections Committee lSGEC> con-
cerning the qualifications of Aca-
demic Commissioner candidate
Joseph Forbes.

The SGEC claimed that Forbes.
who is expected to graduate in De-
cember. l971. is not qualified
to run for the office of commis-
sioner because he will not be able
to complete his term of office.

Forbes contended that accord-
ing to the recently passed Student
Association Constitution, he met
all of the qualifications specified
in the three page document. The
constitution, he stated, required
only that the term of office be one
year and had no stipulations for
the length of time a candidate is
able to spend in office. “Let the
students decide if I am qualified
to serve as commissioner,”
Forbes retorted at the conclusion
of the hearing.

The URB. which is the final ap-
peal board for all election dis-
putes. recommended. on the basis
of constitutions vagueness. that
"Forbes be considered a qualified

candidate." and that the new com-
missioners. when elected. amend
the constitution to provide for
candidate qualifications. fulfilling
vacant offices._ and clarify the
exact lengths of the terms of
office.

According to URB spokesman.
"The dispute arose out. of the
vagueness of the Constitution.
The SGEC had many valid points.
but going strictly by the Constitu-
tion. Forbes must be considered a
qualified candidate. The members
of the Review Board feel that the
commissioners must amend the
constitution to eliminate misun-
derstandings like this in the fu-
ture."

Mike Hout. a junior sociology
major. is a candidate for the of-
fice of CAS Cabinet chairman.

He served on MDC for two
years. first as a senator. then as
treasurer. Elected an SG senator
last January. he served during the
summer on the University Sen-
ate Council.

If elected, Hout’s first priority
would be to secure passage of the
Prologue Program for freshmen
when it comes to a vote before the
University Senate and to see then
that it is effectively implemented.

“Idealling any freshmen who
wanted to should be allowed in.“
Hout said. “But since this is a
trial year. only 300 may enter. I
do not think that the selection
should be left to one administra-
tor. There must be student repre-
sentation on the selection commit-
tee."

Another top priority of Hout‘s
is the reorganization of the regis-
tration procedure.

Gustines On The Rocks

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

“Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me.
And may there be no moaning
of the bar
When Iput out to sea.”
—From "Crossing The Bar“
by Alfred Lord Tennyson

It wasn't quite as idyllic as
Tennyson might have liked. but
a local bar was crossed last
Tuesday by more than a score
of women angered by what they
considered the discriminatory
practice of refusing women ser-
vice at the bar.

The bar is a part of Gustines
Restaurant & Bar located at 3911
Forbes Ave. The women. repre-
sentatives of the Concerned
Women of Pittsburgh. contend
that on two different occasions.
women were refused service at
the bar. and that during one of
these incidents. two women
were ordered to vacate their
seats in favor of men.

Believing this practice illegal.

the Concerned Women filed
complaints with the Mayor's
Human Relations Commission

against Gustine’s charging the
owner with discrimination on
the basis of sex. In a written
press release. the group termed
its Tuesday evening “drink-in"
a “ . protest against this es-
tahlishment’s blatant disregard
of the law.”

Frank Gustine. owner of the
restaurant. said that though the
two specific incidents may have
occurred. the house policy does
not prohibit women from being
served at the bar.

“When women. especially un-
escorted women sit at the bar."

W011   Sa

 

   

explained Gustine prior to the
demonstration. ‘we tell them
that wed prefer them to sit in
one of our booths or tables.
Sometimes there's some pretty
strong language used at the bar
by men unwinding after work.
and its always been our policy
to ask women to sit somewhere
else.

“But if they insist on it. why
then we serve them at the bar.
Hell. ld serve them on the roof
if that's where they wanted to
drink.“

Gustine was supported by
several patrons.
“No one really minds if

they sit here and drink." com-
plained one Iron City sipper at
the end of the bar." but they
don't really want that. They
just want to make some kind of
challenge.”

Shortly after 6:30, the chal-
lenge was on. About 25 women
entered the restaurant, crowded
round the half-filled bar, and
demanded service. Most of the
men at the bar accepted the

women philosophically. The Iron
City drinker at the end of the
bar surveyed the damages and
ordered another drink.

“I‘ll tell you what the real
problem is." he announced not
too loudly. "The real sin is
that out of all these women.
only two or three are good look-
ing." Whatever else he may
have been saying was drowned
in Iron City.

On the whole. the service of
the women proceeded smoothly.
All those with L.C.B. cards were
served with little fanfare. there
were. however. some sharp ex-
changes.

The bartender, attempting to
ask the women if they wouldn’t
mind moving into booths, was
frozen in mid-sentence by a
small wincing woman who told
him: “Your job as bartender is
not to ask us to leave but to ask
us what we want. Now, ask me
what I want and I’ll tell you
what it is.”

He did. she did. and the bar
was crossed.

Employment-top priorit

by CAROL SCATES
"Women Liberated . . .‘."‘ a
panel discussion sponsored by

Women's Liberation. took place
in the Stephen Foster Memorial
on January 13.

Moderator Carol Kline. Direc-‘

tor of Continuing Education for
Women. began by relating her
experiences at the University
of Wisconsin more than 35 years
ago. What a woman wants. she
said is “quality of employment;
education; child and day care.
so that she can have time for
volunteer services and jobs; and
free abortion when she wants
it. so long as she has two doc-
tor’s opinions." .

She pointed out that 14 univer-
sities, including Pitt, were losing
money from the Federal Govern-
ment because they discriminated
against women. The HEW, in ex-
amining Pitt, revealed that out
of 385 professors, only 16 are
women; 316 associate professors,
only 42 are female; out of 404
assistant professors, 126 are
women.

There are only 15 women in-
structors out ‘of 175. “Note that
the numbers increase as the
relative status decreases,” she
added. “We have only 10 women
in top administrative posts and
only two deans in the entire
university. and those are in
women's professions."

Margaret Hodges, a distin-
guished Daughter of Pennsyl-
vania and assistant professor at
the School of Library and Infor-
mational Services, in relation to
fulfillment outside the home,
stated, “A career is not neces-
sarily going to give a woman
happiness.”

Speaking about combining
working with homemaking. she
added. “There is a time for one
thing and a time for another.
Many women are driving them-
selves for some inner reason and
are wondering how they will
ever have time to get it all
donef’

Kline added. “Women must
get their priorities straight. Mar-
riage and a career can balance
themselves if homemakers set
appropriate time scheduling fo
eachf' '

Marcia Landy, assistant pro-
fessor in the department of Eng-
lish, was concerned with the dif-
ference between legal rights and
women’s liberation. Rights con-
cern employment opportunities,
and liberation deals with atti-
tudes towards roles in society.

“Most of the attitudes towards
women today comes from the
traditional status of women over
the centuries," she said and then
posed the question. “Do day
care centers change attitudes?“

Lauren B. Resnick. Director
of the Primary Education Pro-
ject and Learning and Research
Development Center. in speak-
ing of the name changes after
marriage. feels that “symbols
such as ‘Mrs.‘ only matter if
they symbolize something real.
Over the centuries women have
been viewed as the property of
men. which is why we have
problems today in getting equal-
ity for women."

She feels that one of the main
problems lies in women’s be-
coming equal to men.

She stated. “I don’t want to
be defined by my husband. not

as Mrs. Sorand So the wife of .

  

. . . I want my own professional’

life. I don't want his approval.
The only problem is that our
men must agree to it. Men try
to possess us. Women's libera-
tion must teach us not to own
each other. “

Elizabeth Scott, a member of
the Advisory Council for Women’s
Opportunities and the only black
participant, in speaking why she
is involved with women’s libera-
tion,_ said “There is a partial
truth to the notion that black
women don’t have an interest
in the feminist movement, due
to our concern for rights as citi-
zens first. However, as the black
woman moves up the ladder
economically, she falls into the
white woman’s dilemma.”

Page 4—'l‘HE PITT NEWS—Monday, January 18, 1971

Last week the Pitt News Edi-
torial Board interviewed all the
candidates for the Commission-
er positions, as well as some of
the contestants for academic

.cabinet chairman. Several of
the candidates were articulate.
concerned informed. while oth-
ers were woefully unprepared
for office.

Respecting the right of each
undergraduate to make up his
own mind, the Pitt News will
make no endorsements. But.
having questioned the candi-
‘dates for Commissioners and
CAS academic cabinet chair-
man in some detail, we feel an
obligation to suggest which
candidates seem more likely to
perform well.

Dennis Concilla. who is run-
ning for Programming Com-
missioner emerges a strong
candidate. The former Direc-
tor of Public Relations for Stu-
dent Government, he is equip-
ped with more experience than
Tom Bailey, his opponent.

, Concilla has proposed an in-
vestigation into University
spending, has expressed dismay
at the “$26,000 profit which
the administration makes on
the University Book Store," and
is outraged at “a 10% kickback
on insurance policies” which

-he claims the administration is
also getting.

Tom Bailey has been active
in Orientation, Freshman Camp

_ and the Mentor Program, but

lacks Concilla’s awareness. He

appreciates the overlap prob-
lems which the four Commis-
sioners may encounter and he
intends to work in close con-
junction with the Student Un-
ion Board. which is laudable.
but he appears to need some
seasoning.

Ted Michalik, a sophomore
Engineer. seems the best can-
didate for Academic Commis-
sioner, although Joseph Forbes.
is admittedly informed and
concerned.

Michalik‘s desire to initiate

a new registration system is
commendable, though Mike
Hout. candidate for CAS Cab-
inet Chairman, seems to have
a better proposal. If Michalik
is elected, however, the Pitt
News hopes that he will not
pose as the engineering School's
lobbyist in Student Govern-
ment.

He has suggested that Engin-
eers receive a kickback from
Student Activities fees since.
he contends, they do not par-
ticipate as actively as CAS
students do‘ in campus activi-
ties. If Michalik is elected. we
urge him to produce facts on
relative involvement. We feel
that a better solution is to pro-
mote activism among engin-
eers, nurses, etc., if indeed
they are less active.

Joe Forbes deserves plaudits
for the extensive research he
has done into campus prob-
lems. He is anxious to improve
course evaluation and is dis-

tressed by the “vagueness of
the Constitution. He, however.

We find both suggestions ex-

We are not happy with the

feel that abolition is not the
answer. Nor are we so unrea-
listic as to think that the stu-

be raised. if the hike were sub-

valid need for the hike exist-

The
Relevance

of
Patriotism

by FRANK DONATELLI
Staff Columnist

Probably the surest way to subject oneself to
an ear-splitting tirade from some “intellectual“ is
to profess the belief that patriotism is a desirable

 

. commodity.-

Unfortunately. nothing is more intellectually
invigorating for some than the chance to demean
America and her institutions. And yet the present
situation, for practical as well as theoretical rea-

‘ sons. demands a renewal of the vital concept if
« we are to survive.

It is the great paradox of our time that Ameri-
ca, which purports to represent the tradition of
Western Civilization. although possessing the
mightiest armanda of weapons every assembled by
man, has continually lost ground to its enemies in

i T A the struggle for the world.

Time after time in the post-war period. in ev-
ery crucial confrontation between ourselves and
the Communist Empire (Czechoslavakia. Korea.
China, Hungary. Vietnam — to name a few). the
United States. despite overwhelming arms super-
iority and bargaining position. has continually
fretted away its advantages. and suffered humiliat-
ing setbacks in the process.

One is led to ask why this should be so. If
military inferiority is not the answer. the key to
the delemma would seem to indicate something
intrinsic rather than material.$a

Apparently our thought processes have been
distorted somewhere along the line so that our as-
sumptions are not those of traditional Western
thought. The prevailing intellectual force of our
time has robbed us of our social cohesion thereby
leaving us defenseless against an enemy that The
New York Times has called “the greatest system-
atic assault on the human spirit in the history of
the world. ’ ‘ $a

This alien force has many aliases. (e.g. libera-
lism, radicalism) but its traits are always the
same. It believes in the perfectibility of man.
thereby encouraging the forces of materialism
while denying the relevance of morality.

It is contemptible of tradition and the doctrile
of cautious and slow change. thereby creating an
impatience with the limitations of constitutional
government while glorifying the call for imme-
diate action.$a

It adheres to political and economic leveling.
which ultimately reduces society to a “labora-

tory” in which government plannersjsee human .

Against The Tide

  

      

beings I‘ engineer
views materials for building bridges — pieces to be
manipulated so they will fit into a grand design.

But perhaps the most destructive result of this
alien force has been the destruction of what Pro-
fessor Ernest Van den Haag calls "shared values."
Every society that has ever existed in history for a
reasonable amount of time has done so because
it accepted the idea that certain questions are
closed.$a

Certain actions are prohibited: (The use of
violence by individual citizens not empowered by
law to do so) and certain expressions of opinion
are severely scrutinized (The espousal of genocide
against a section of society) so that society may
maintain some semblence of order and stability.
Societal modes of operation (democracy. aristo-
cracy. monarchy) are secondary compared with the
values that a society should stand for.

This, then. is the modern malaise. Confronted
by the Communist challenge. modern liberalism.
rather than calling upon those institutions which
could help in the struggle. have instead destroyed
these basic foundations. without which we are
doomed.$a

Rather than encouraging each and every Ameri-
can to support his country in this time of crisis.
he either ignores this powerful weapon or he ac-
tually excuses disloyalty. whether it be the dis-
respect some blacks show for the National Anthem
or the destruction of the American flag by white
radicals.

  

In his discussion of this whole issue. James
Burnham writes in The Suicide of the West :$a
Men become willing to endure. sacrifice
and die for God. family. king. honor. coun-
try. from a sense of absolute duty or an
exalted vision of the meaning of history . .
And it is precisely these ideals and institu-
tions that liberalism has criticized. attack-
ed. and in part overthrown as supersti-
tious. archaic. reactionary. and irrational . .
no one is willing to sacrifice and die for
progressive education. medicare. humanity
in the abstract. the United Nations and a
ten per cent raise in Social Security Pay-
ments.$a
Hence. it would seem that the person who
recently wrote in the "Letter to the Editor" sec-
tion of a famous national magazine that it was
"mindless flag wavers who have caused our pre-
sent ills" was entirely mistaken. Indeed. our pre-
sent troubles may stem from the fact that there

' aren't more of them.

Schwartz has investigated a
couple of registration models.
which he is familiar with.

Besides. Hout. who is more
familiar than Schwartz with the
University's past accomplish-
ments in the field of academic
reform. has pledged to push
immediately if elected. for the
Prologue Program (which will
be considered by the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences on the
23rd of this month). Schwartz
too favors this program. but he
would probably prove a less
articulate spokesman for it.

Three experienced candidates
are running for Committees
Commissioner: Mark Hiller.
Wade Lawson. and Arnie Stein-
berg.

Steinberg. like Michalik. be-
lieves that nurses and engin-
eers. should receive some sort
of kickback from the Activities
Fee. but we have already stat-
ed our disagreement with such
an idea. He is experienced. to
be sure having surved as head
of the Men‘s Dorm Council, but
we feel that his character was
all to openly reflected by the
Best Stacked Broad on Camp-
us Contest. a debacle which he
proposed. No campus leader can
afford such a juvenile mis-
take.

Mark Hiller, who has pledg-
ed to resign as Environmental
Actio’n/Zero Population Growth
coordinator, would probably
make a good Committees Com-
missioner. No commissioner.
however. can have a one track
mind fear that Hiller might
prove too myopic for the posi-
tion. It is only a fear but it is
something to consider.

Wade Lawson seems to be
concerned about a broader
range than does Hiller. He has
proposed printing a brochure

Associate Editor

(Editor's Note: The follow-
ing is the conclusion of a two
part series. The first article
dealt with the removal of the

Technicutie feature from the
Skyscraper Engineer. A minor
clarification is necessary con-

cerning that column. The Jan-
uary 8 meeting of the maga-
zine’s editorial board was call-
ed, at the urging of Mrs. Es-
ther Kitzes, Director of Student
Publications, by the board
members themselves at their
December 8 session.)

A second case in which "an
invitation to accept the risks
and rewards of moral leader-
ship.‘ was advanced involved
the University Theatre which

sponsored a student produced

and directed version of the
classic. The Fantasticks.

To the extent of my know-
ledge. those involved were not
approached concerning the sex-
iest content of the musical play.

However. the characters
(characterizations?) and the
situations were so stereotyped
and the theme so traditional
that the producers had an un-
spoken responsibility to re-ex-
amine the premises of the work
in the light of changing con-
sciousness.

As a society progresses, its
works of “art” must be re-eval-
uated, as has been done by a
new generation esposed to the
classicly racist Gone With the
Wind.

The play. centered around a
table of truth vs. illusion deals
with the love story of “a boy"
and "a girl". The work is nar-
rated and more or less held to;

suggestion. He has
suggested that stu-

cellent

however
dents get a discount from me-
ter maids and has called for
sleeping quarters for commut-
ers by September of this year—
both of which seem unrealis-

tic suggestions. but he does
seem concerned about all stu-
dents. If he is elected. we coun-
sel him to take caution.

Running f'or Social Commis-
sioner are Lenny Klavonic.
current SG Head and Hank Al-
ford. MDC Social Chairman.
Klavonic has more experience
than any other candidate.
both in Student Government
and in the social sphere parti-
cularly.

Alford. however, seems much
more committed to appealing
to a broad range of student
tastes. He also has proposed
having groups on campus like
the Fireside Theater. which
would be a new twist to cam-
pus entertainment. Finally he
is extremely interested in im-
proving relations between the
University and the community.
and has proposed inviting local
high school students to sympos-
iums on campus — giving them
a preview of college life as
well as allowing us to profit
from their insights.

Klavonic deserves the thanks
of every student from the
countless hours he has put in
over the past half year trying
to serve students and represent
them. No one has been more
hard working. We feel. though.
that electing him as Social
Commissioner is not a proper
way to thank him. He deserv-
es retirement as much as the
aspiring student leader de-
serves a chance to serve. We
‘do hope that he will advise
other student leaders and
share his valuable experience
with them.

Sexist Failure

symbol of male chauvinism
and worldly wisdom.

The sole female character of
The Fantasticks is portrayed
as.a mindless sentimentalist
who continually spouts inane.
little girl lines. “The girl" is
dominated by the males of the
play and captivated by shows
of strength and male power
plays.

In one scene, three of the
male characters consider the
concept of rape, the ultimate
degradation of a woman and
the final reinforcement of
her physical helplessness, as
good fare for a parody reeking
with tasteless humor.

After the “rape" is attempt-
ed and fails (through prior de-
sign). the female considers it
an indication of her self worth.
Throughout the remaindor of
The Fantasticks, she wears
a pink-ribbon token of her al-
most violation and “kisses it
three times every day."

As the play progresses, she
learns that her goal of a life
“without housework and dish-
es" is inferior to THE GREAT
LOVE which. symplistically.
solves all of her problems.

Within the fabilized struc-
ture, the role of the woman is
passed off as the norm and, in
view of the blissfully happy
ending, an acceptable stereo-
type.

El Gallo is perhaps the most
obvious indication of the male
orientation of" The Fantasticks.
Not only does he carry the mor-
al of the play. but he also func-
tions as male superhero.

dership confronts even those

To the Editor. The Pitt News.

We would like to correct the
statements of Mr. Bonn's article
concerning the Senate deadlock
over the issue of The Pitt News
salaries on January 7. Since Mr.
Bonn was not present at that
meeting. we feel that it is our
duty to clarify the mispercep—
tions he presents in his article.

The Allocations Committee
will. at any time. consider a re-
quest for additional publishing
monies. We strongly believe
that The Pitt News should con-
tinue printing and are willing
to fund any additional publica-
tion costs. However. the discus-
sion at the Senate meeting was
not concerned with the publi-
cation costs but rather with the
funding of student salaries
through the Activities Fee.

The Committee has never
questioned the amount of time
and effort devoted to The Pitt
News by its members. Nor has
it ever questioned the time and
monetary loss incurred by The
Pitt News staff. But we believe
that other organizations also have
dedicated members who make
sacrifices for the sake of their
organizations.

The power of which Mr.
Klavonic and Mr. Bonn speak
does lie with the students. The
elected SG Senate approved our
appointment to the Allocations
Committee. feeling that we
were. of the applicants‘ inter-
viewed. best qualified for the
position. Also. it is the elected
Senate which has the final ap-
proval or rejection of all our
recommendations. Because of

 

 
  

graduate?

believe that the only alterna-
tive is to ask the students to de-

. cide on the question of salaries

to students through a referen-
dum vote.

 

The question of allocating
funds to The Pitt News editorial
staff arose this past summer

- when the News requested funds

for publication costs. At that
time we-funded the total amount
requested to cover the publica-
tion costs and sufficient funds
for organizational costs.

At that point. we believed that
there should be further discus-
sion on the question of funding
salaries and possibly bringing
the issue before the students
for a referendum. After lengthy
review of the information sup-
plied by the News. the Com-
mittee formulated the following
policy statement:

The Allocations Committee would like
to clarify our position on wages to any
student organization. It has been the com-
mittee's policy that no student funds be

   
  
  

1. Broke? Bored? Depressed by the Environment? 2-
Wondering if you'll get a job even if you do

used in recompense tor services rendered
to any student organization. The Commit-
tee believes that a student's participation
in student activities should not be moti-
vated by‘ desire tor monetary gain, but
rather by the educational and cultural en-
richment he receives. The Student Activ-
ities Fee is already overburdened by nu-
merous requests lor programming, can-
certs, and other entertainment costs, in
addition to subsidizing administrative
costs of over lilty recognized student or-
ganizations. Theretore, the Allocations
Committee strongly believes that it is
unfair for students to pay the costs of
wages for other students. As a policy de-
cision, the Committee refuses to recom-
mend any salaries to any student organi-
zation at any time.

Due to a lack of understand-
ing of our policy statement. the

Senate voted that the News
would receive salaries. They
then decided that the funding

for this expense should come
from student Activities Fees
rather than from an additional
tax on the students the Fall
term.

They further decided that all
future funding for salaries
would come from other sources.
and not further burden student
Activities Fees. Following this
decision by the Senate. the funds
were transferred from the Alloca-
tions fund to the News’ account.
with the formal commitment from
the Senate. that the Allocations
Committee would never again
be asked to pay any student sal-
aries.

At this same meeting,
Senate promised the News that
they would establish a committee
to seek alternative sources to
obtain the salaries. At the last
Senate meeting, it was discover-
ed that this committee never
met.

Therefore the question of who
would pay the salaries came up
again. The deadlock occurred
when the Senate realized that
it could not keep both promises
at the same time. We formally
reiterated our policy statement.

It is unfortunate that the lame-
duck Senate retraced their com-
mitment to the students by at-
tempting to force them to absorb
the cost of the Senate's error.
When pressured to change our
policy decision. the Committee
stated that if. at any time. the
student body. through a referen-
dum vote. decides to grant salar-
ies to students. the allocation com-
mittee would fund any such re-
quest.

This recommendation was re-
jected by hoth the.Senate and
The Pitt News. The News offer-
ed to meet the salary expense at
the sacrifice of reducing the
number of issues published. The
Committee felt that this was un-
fair to the students because
The Pitt News had been funded
the publication costs for the
entire year, and therefore sug-
gested that if the Senate wanted
to keep its promise to both par-
ties, it could fund the salaries
from their own budget.

It is unfortunate that the is-
sues were not objectively report-
ed by Mr. Bonn. and we suggest
that if he desires any further
information. he should come to
the Allocations Committee. get-
ting the facts “from the horse’s
mouth." instead of from "the
horse'sass."

Skyscraper issue 'misussed’

Dear Miss Joyce;
Associate Editor,
(The Pitt News):

We the (Skyscraper Engineer)
staff feel that we have been
grossly misused and request a
restatement of your editorial of
January 13.

At the December 8‘. 1970 exe-
cutive board meeting of the Sky-
scraper it came to our attention
that the Technicutie feature had

    

   

\ ,, — km" A
offend d one and mig t have of-
fended other women members
of the School of Engineering.
We decided to invite the woman
student from the School of En-
gineering and two concerned fe-
male students to our next execu-
tive board meeting.

We hoped they would give
us feed back from the women's
population of the University on
this issue. We. the Skyscraper
Engineer staff had decided to
reevaluate the Technicutie sec-
tion of the magazine.

At the opening of the January
executive board meeting Dean
Minor Hawk, a member of the
board, pointed out this meeting
was being called to provide the
women a chance to air their
views.
or decision was to be made by
the board at this time.

Your editorial in The Pitt

however no comittment .

News (Jan 13) falsely sets up a
confrontation between your-
selves and the executive board
by using 80 percent of our state-
ments out of context. We stated
that we saw you reading more
into the Technicutie feature than
the male reader sees.

Dana Ventriglia's question of
the need of publishing the
Skyscraper Engineer quote:

“If you can’t sell the publica-
tion to your readers on the basis
of its intrinsic quality and its
relevance to the lives of your
readers. then why do you pub-
lish?"
assumes that
only value is
cutie feature.

Do you really believe Pitt
engineers consider the only
rationals for supporting and
publishing the Skyscraper En-
gineer is to print pictures -of
the Technicutie‘? A ~

The Technicutie was never
said to be replaced by anything.
but that it would be absent from
the magazine until feed back
from the rest of the School of
Engineering could be weighed.
We do not understand your accu-
sation of being sexist with the
Technicutie feature. but do not
wish to discriminate against wo-
men.

I would like to thank you for
helping open awareness of prob-
lems of the women engineer. for
this is the true function of the
Skyscraper Engineer.

Yours truly.

When a director takes a show of
no content or value and puts it on
anyway. as if to say "if we dress
it up and put pretty costumes on
everyone. no one will know the dif-
ference." experimentation in the-
atre becomes a con game between
the director :who decides on the
play. judges its worth. and as-
sumes responsibility for its com-
ing across) and the audience who
pays to receive what's on the mar-
quee.

Expermintation in the form of
alteration is usually done with the

. prospect of making the play even

more enjoyable and meaningful
without destroying those aspects
which brought about the reason
for its selection and original suc-
cess.

There are arguments for and
against such a decision. but on the
whole if the director fails to
achieve the original brilliance of
the play and if those changes. sub-
tle as they may be. water it down
instead of build up the concept
there is only one person to take
the blame.

But it does take guts, skill, and
shows a devotion to the show and
the audience alike (as well as a
love for the medium and faith in
self by trying to improve that
which is already successful.

Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt.
along with original director Ward
Baker stress simplicity as the
basic ingredient for the success
of The Fantasticks.

The set is a small platform with
four poles at each corner and a
sheet to cover the front with
The Fantasticks inked across it.
a trunk from which “the players“
enter and exit. a few pieces of

sparkle. and simple area lighting.

There is a mute, whose purpose
is to function soley as a “no" char-
acter aiding the imagination as he
builds the wall and tears it down,
etc., a boy and a girl—their fath-
ers and a narrator.

It is small. tight. and beautiful-
ly simple. Technical aspects are
secondary to the story and of no
distraction. Anything other than
dialogue. words. and so on are
there to reinforce and revive the
imagination.

The Studio Theatres produc-
tion of The Fantastic-ks is direct-
ed by Sherry Caldwell. Reflecting
on what I have already said
about experimentation —- she
should be highly commended. and
although her efforts have altered
the show in its final affect. admire
her for her willingness to try to
do “one better.“

The words. music and dialogue

   
    
    
      
   

are the same, but the recipe is
different. She uses a square
thrust stage and upon that has
built a second level, splitting the
action and attention.

There is an extra character

living prop). a mute who now has

expression and some character.
a ballet «modern dance‘?). addi-
tional choreography. blatantly
colorful and complicated lighting.
as well as a technical schemata
that seems to only cause mistakes.

Such added theatricality and
bigness in added “effects" is un-
fortunate in a simple show. Most
of it works. but not to the benefit
of the show itself.

Unfortunately, there is a differ-
ence between her Fantasticks and
the show Jones and Schmidt con-
ceived. If you have seen both pro-
duction this is evident. If not, this
low key, somewhat diluted ver-
sion is nonetheless enjoyable.

It is now watered down and
spread thin. The “littleness“ i.e.
quaintness subtleness. charm are
intruded upon by the mute and the
living prop (who lies around much
of the time on the second level).

The lights do little for the mood
and show shadow. darkness. and
in some instances a lack of fram-
ing. In addition. the stage causes
deliniation and separation.

Blocking is square and some-
what clumsy. Caldwell has unfor-
tunately blocked this show for a
phscenism stage leaving those on
the sides to suffer a bit.

The technical additions on both
levels only serve to clutter things
and don‘t often work. Blocking
and choreography are limited be-
cause of the use of the thrust

The Fantasticks

stage. the original being done at
floor level.

The use of the double level in
the "Round andgRound" number
worked quite nicely. however. and
even the lighting came over to a
point. Betty Rothbart's choreo-
graphy is fine. especially in the
second part of the “Rape Ballet“
and “The Ballet." In other in-
stances (“This Plum Is Too
Ripe") it was disastrous.

The costumes and make-up are
substantial — but the stage pat-
tern looked like the mess the dog
left behind (a splatter effect —
with paint that is — would have
been much more effective here).

Commissioner Candidates Vie fo

Steinberg Proposes

Allocations Review 0

 

ARNIE STEINBERG
Photo by Mark Lieberman

Arnie Steinberg, president of
the Men’s Dormitory Council and
Student Government (SG) sena-
tor, is a candidate for Commit-
tees Commissioner under the
“Common Cause" Party.

Steinberg is also a member of
the Student Affairs Advisory
Committee, Druids honorary fra-
ternity, Zeta Beta Tau fraternity,
Men’s Council, SG Organizations
and Procedures Committee, Cam-
pus Food Policy Committee, and
the Pitt Concert Band.

If elected Committees Commis-
sioner, Steinberg proposes to re-
organize the by-laws of the Allo-
cations Committee to “make it re-
sponsible to elected students and
prevent it from dictating budget-
ary policy to student representa-
tives.”

Wade Lawson, a first term jun-
ior with a major in Urban Affairs,
is running for Committees Com-
missioner.

Lawson, who was one of the or-
ganizers of the March on Harris-
burgh Campaign in 1970 and co-
chairman of Orientation 1971, was
also chairman of Black Week —
1970, and is a Steering Committee
member of BAS. '

Lawson states that he is an
“independent candidate with no
ties to any slate.”

His stands on Off Campus Hous-

~ing include rent controls to pro-

tect students, a brochure which
“recommends and publicizes
availability of housing” to be pub-
lished every term, and a war
against “Luxury Landlords.”

On the topic of Health Services.
Lawson advocates expanded serv-
ices in the areas of treatment and
medical coverage by the inclusion
of students under the same Blue
Cross, Blue Shield insurance pro-
gram that the University offers
its employees with the same ben-
efits; he also favors the creation
of an administrative faculty-stu-
dent advisory board to determine
the rates of health services offer-
ed. .

He also feels that “students
should have the right to refuse in-
surance coverage offered to his
or her own individual circum-
stances.” Presently, the dorm
students do not have that right.

Lawson wants the Book Store
to function on a non-profit basis.
with more students on its advi-
sory board.

For commuters, the candidate

. is in favor of larger facilities in

the Student Union and Dorms and
suggests adding “a bowling area,

 

Also, Steinberg maintains that
“spending policies should be re-
ordered to put the first priority on
programming and organizations
which deal withthe total student
community.” SG committees, ac-
cording to Steinberg, “should be
organized for all students in the
University and not allow any sin-
gle group of students to control
pohcyf’

Steinberg feels that commit-
tees must “force the University
to fund." On the functions of the
SG committees. Steinberg stated.
“The operations of SG involve
basically money and people. But
both assets are usually squander-
ed by mismanagement and poli-
tics. Money is given away to too
many and sometimes underserv-
ing organizations. To solve the hu-
man problem in University gover-
nance, the Commission should
give power to the appointments
committee to recommend stu-
dents with ability to fill the policy
posts in SG and the University.“

“To solve the money problem,”
Steinberg continued, “the process
of allocation of funds whould be
reviewed and restructured. Prior-
ity should be given to programs
and organizations which benefit
the entire University and student
community. SG’s role should be
changed to coordinating and facil-
itating instead of spending and
wasting money on programs it
mismanaged because of its lack
of experience, manpower, and its
internal politics.

more pool tables and sleeping
areas and sleeping rooms in the
droms; also the “establishment
of a lounge and snack area that is
operated and controlled on a non-
profit basis by commuters."

To alleviate the parking situa-
tion, Lawsons wants investiga-
tions of parking lot distribution,
feasibility of new areas, Meter
Maids and ticket distribution. He
feels that a partial solution would
be “the creation of meters with
times greater than four hours in
conjunction with a decrease in
parking rates.”

Better food service, which
Lawson supports. can. he claims.
be managed with students having
a decision in determing the menu
and prices.

Finally. Wade Lawson is in
favor of an “increase in commun-
ications between students, Stu-
dent Government and administra-
tors." He feels that “an inform-
ed student body is an active stu-
dent body.”

 

 

 

Concilla: Wary Bailey 1 Fight

DENNIS CONCILLA
Photo by Bob Donaldson

Dennis Concilla is a sophomore Political Science
major from Northeast, Pa. This year, he was the
SG director of Public Relations, and in the past, he
has served on the Residence Hall Advisory Board
and as treasurer of Men's Dormitory Council.

After two years experience of working within
the administration, Concilla feels that its “prior-
ities are set up wrong.“ “All too often,” said Con-
cilla, “the administration is either unconcerned or
unaware of student problems.”

If elected Programming Commissioner, Concilla
hopes to investigate some cases of what he feels to
be administrative mismanagement. Included
among those cases are the “great number of inac-
tive committees,” the alleged $26,000 profit by the
University Book Center, and the reported 10 per
cent kickback received by the University on all
student insurance policies.

Concilla was also opposed to the recently en-
acted SG Constitution because the power granted it
by the Allocations Committee. “Why should a self-
perpetuating committee tells us all how’to spend
all of our money?” asked Concilla," who pointed to
the recent Allocations Committee-SG Senate im-
passe as evidence of the inordinate power of the
committee.

Though not a member of any party, Concilla re-
ported that he is “loosely affiliated" with Mark
Hiller and Lenny Klavonic. “We've talked together
about many things," said Concilla.“ and we are en-
dorsing each other. though we have no formal par-
ty organization.“

 

THOMAS BAILEY

Thomas Bailey is a candidate for Program Com-
missioner. He is a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fra-
ternity, publicity chairman for the Men’s Dormitory
Council, and a mentor.

Bailey maintains that the job of programming
should be “put in the hands of the people with the
competence that SG lacks." He feels that money
should be allocated to the Student Union Board "to
hire entertainment which the-board has experience
and manpower to get.”

SG’s role, Bailey says, should be one of coordinat-
ing and facilitating the job of the Student Union
Board in getting speakers and concerts for Univer-
sity students.

In addition to his suggestions about improving en-
tertainment, Bailey proposes to fight the rising tui-
tion rates by “pressuring the University to cut back
costs,” and to “fight for increased subsidies from
the State to end the financial dilemma at the Uni-
versity.”

Bailey also believes that the University Senate
should be organized in such a way that it will “rep-
resent all students at the University with no single
group of students controlling policy."

Finally, Bailey stresses the idea to “work with
all students to solve our common problems rather
than fight over what separates us.” Bailey is a
“Common Cause" Party candidate.

Hiller Stresses Greater Student

March Hiller is a candidate for
Committees Commissioner. Hill-
er presently holds office in sever-
al student organizations. He is
chairman of the Student Govern-
ment Health Service Organization
and is coordinator of both the
University's and Pennsylvania‘s
Environmental Action. Inc. He is
a member of several honoraries.
Druids; Omicron Delta Kappa;
Beta Beta Beta. national biologi-
cal honorary, and Alpha Epsilon
Delta. national pre-med honorary.

Hiller is running on the proposi-
tion that decisions concerning
students should be made by stu-
dents. "In essence." he declares.
“let the administration know that
issues involving the students. in
most cases. should be labeled
“hands off."

 

MARC HILLER

serted. “The University is contin-
uing to build parking. lots for fac-

ulty and administrators, yet is
excluding the students."

Hiller advocates giving stu-
dents a voice in deciding on such
matters as who will be granted
dormitory food contracts, when
and by how much tuition and room
costs will be raised, and what
sorts of concerts and speaker pro-
grams will be presented at the
University.

The candidate for Committees
Commissioner feels that “stu-
dents should demand representa-
tion on the Board of Directors of
‘our’ University" and all other po-
licy-drafting committees.

Hiller concluded, “As a candi-
date. I find myself running in an

The candidate feels that stu-
dents should investigate adminis-
trative control in both actions and
finances. He points out that there
are several areas in which he
feels students are “getting screw-
ed.”

For instance, Hiller argues that
the University Book Center is ov-

Student Government should look
into the situation and take prompt
acﬂon.

The candidate points out that
the University failed to sign a con-
tract that would rent certain lots
for commuter parking. Hiller as-

 

ing else to do but because there is
a tremendous job that must be
done and not too many people are

willing to do it. . . . Ifeel a strong
line must be taken with the ad-
ministration. . . . If elected. I will
guarantee . . . to help my peers

through services, facilities, and
open mindedness on all issues.”

Ted Michalik is running for the
position of Academic Commis-
sioner on the “Common Cause”
ticket. Michalik serves as a mem-
ber of the Engineering Student
Cabinet and the Men’s Dormitory
Council (MDC) Food Service Sub-
committee. Michalik plays bass
in the Pitt Bands and is a recent
pledge of Kappa Kappa Psi Band
Fraternity.

Michalik proposes that students
should get their “education dol-
lar’s worth.” He points out that
in many cases students do not.
Courses in his estimation run
from mediocrity to excellence.
Freshmen and sophomores must
often suffer through distribution
courses that are not “thought pro-
voking” and that often ignore the
“intent and purpose of a liberal
arts education.”

The candidate for Academic
Commissioner feels that the prob-
lems of education can be dealt
with on three levels. First, Mich-
alik advocates modernization of
the education administration. For
example he feels the University
should organize an “operations
research team to investigate the
most efficient ways of dealing

with the registration and offerings ‘

of courses.”

Michalik would also like to see
each department establish a
learning productivity committee

out of Student Government alto-
gether, but I decided that I might
be able to help students and at the
same time help myself

One of Lednak’s major objec-
tions is to the handling of the stu-
dent activities fee. “It’s not real-
ly fair,” he said, “that though
only some students pay the $8
fee, everybody uses the money.
Other people, such as grad stu-
dents, should pay.”

Lednak is also concerned about
the early closing of classes. “If a
student wants a class. he should
be able to get. There is sufficient
space at the University in such
buildings as Engineering Hall and
the Stephen Foster Memorial to
hold more classes.“ Lednak also
favors the further implementa-
tion of such innovations as the
Free University.

As an engineering student. Led-
nak maintains that “engineers
are behind the times" and he pro-
poses increased integration into
the mainstream of campus life for
students in engineering, nursing,
and other schools not so heavily
populated as CAS.

which would serve such functions
as “evaluating each professor’s
ability . . . by one of his peers,’ in-
vestigating new ways of teaching
and learning, and investigating
student opinions of their profes-
sorsf’

“Finally,” the candidate pro-
poses, “the University should rec-
ognize its responsibility to cut
back costs and manage itself
more effectively . . . to make Pitt
solvent.”

“Hopefully,” Michalik conclud-
ed. “these ideas will enhance the
ramifications of academic free-
dom. The University should strive
to end the educational chaos that
undermines our future.”

HANK ALFORD

Alford Seeks
 Moderrrtizei Varied Concerts

Hank Alford is a candidate for Social Commis-
sioner with the “Common Cause” Party. Alford, a
varsity football letterman, has been active as so-
cial chairman of both the Men’s Dormitory Council
(MDC) and his dormitory house. He also serves as
a member of MDC’s executive cabinet.

If elected, Alford would like to “diversity the
types of concert programming so it will appeal to
the many different cultural needs of students.”
For instance, he would like to bring to campus “new
crops of entertainment” which “have a comment on
today’s life.”

The candidate for Social Commissioner feels that
Student Government needs more money to hire good
speakers and concerts for the student body and will
seek to increase the amount of allocations given to
Student Government for entertainment if he is
elected.

Alford advocates working with the Student Union
Board to get better entertainment for the Univer-
sity community. He feels members of the board
have the “manpower and experience” to help “up-
grade the professionalism of the students who will
book and organize entertainment.”

The candidate mentioned the possibility of hold-
ing an annual “recognition banquet for area high
school athletes.”

Alford emphasized that the Social Commission of
Student Government must bring to campus more
“groups which please all segments of the student
body.”

Like other members of the Common Cause Par-
ty, Alford sympathizes with Nurses and Engineers
who “do take a less active role in activities."

He favors a “lickback" to them but would pre-
fer subsidizing special Engineering and Nursing
events to an outright refund.

LENNY KLAVONIC

Klavonic Notes

His Experience

Lenny Klavonic, Student Government president,
is a candidate for Social Commissioner of the Stu-
dent Association. Klavonic is also a member of the
University Senate Council, a representative of the
Board of Trustees, chairman of the Legal Aware-

ness Committee, member of the Publications

Board, Druids, and Omicron Delta Kappa Honoar-
ary.

“The experience of working with administra-
tors this past year has left me with the feeling of
empty rhetoric and endless committee studies
which dissolve with no real solution to student prob-
lems,” Klavoinic stated.

Housing is still both substandard and discrimina-
tory. The University still receives kickbacks in
areas of student services. Bookstore prices have
never been higher or food worse, and parking facil-
ities are constructed with regard for student
needs,” he added.

Concerning committees, Klavonic
“Student-administrative committees will not solve

anything. What is needed is that students do it‘

themselves.‘ I want to continue with the larger
Pittsburgh Student Association established this
year by the presidents of the student governments
in Pittsburgh. Students have campaigned for years
on what Student Government can do for you and it
hasn't done anything. Neither can any other Student
Government unless we all work together."

Klavonic added that he is arguing for new prior-
ities on campus entertainment. “Students don’t
want an overabundance of programming on world
economic situations or political forums. but are in-
terested in receiving concerts, movies, dances, and
controversial speakers for their money.” Klavonic
maintained.

“I would like to see entertainment selected di-

rectly by the students, instead of by a
small committee or committee chairmen

with entertainment that comes in generally »

reflecting the tastes of those people and
not the students here at Pitt. What is need-

Joseph Forbes is running independently
as a candiate for Academic Commissioner.
Forbes is chairman of the Men's Council
Judicial Board and is a member of Peoples
Oakland.

Forbes is interested in the improve-
ment of the compilation of the annual
course evaluation booklet was not “worth
the money it cost to put it out."

Forbes complains that over $6,000 was
spent to produce a book that represents the
opinions of approximately only 20 percent
of the student body. “Twenty per cent is
certainly not a sufficient amount from
which to compile accurate figures on how
courses seem to students, in general,” be
said.

“A well-done course evaluation survey
could be used as a means of bringing stu-
dent opinion to bear upon the University to
effect improvement,” declared the candi-
date for Academic Commissioner. By mak-

 

dent opinions Forbes feels the student body
could induce the University to “Loose-up"
its "definite tendency to regard people as
nonentities.“

Forbes advocates the abolition of the
Men‘s Dormitory Council (MDC).

The candidate also feels that student ac-
tivities fees hikes should be decided upon
by means of a student referendum.

The candidate feels that students
should continue to work for such progres-
sive alterations in the academic environ-
ment as the introduction of the credit,/no
entry system and the abolition of various
course requirements. In Forbes‘ opinion
this “progressive attitude" will “enable
the introduction and acceptance of yet
more modern changes in the University
climate to become a reality.”

ed is a diversity of entertainment provid-
ing for a festival weekend each month
in either blues. rock. soul. jazz or folk.”

“Klavonic concluded, "Perhaps the
strongest thing I can offer you, however,
is experience. “Ive already gone through
administrative manipulation. learning the

complicated structure of university gov-

ernance and the devices employed to pre-
vent any real change from taking place in
the student affairs area unless it is done
by students themselves.

Members of the Student Government
Elections Committee have taken steps
to guarantee the fairness of Wednes-
day's elections. They drew up an Election
Code, which has served as the candi-
dates’ guide during the campaign and will
be functioning on Wednesday as poll-
watchers.

It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. These two lines
adequately explain the scene at the Syria Mosque on Saturday evening.
The concert itself, featuring the Three Rivers Blues Band, Big Broth-
ers and the Holding Company. and the James Gang. was perhaps one
of the best ever offered on the Pitt campus. But the happenings both be-
fore and after the concert made the finemusic lose some of its luster.

The evening began on a bad note. Because of some foul up with the
testing of the sound systems inside the concert hall, the crowd was
held outside until 7:30.

The mob that had started to assemble in front of the Mosque at 6
was soon shoulder to shoulder in efforts to both keep warm in the freez-
ing weather and to get good seats when the doors opened. After push-
ing and chanting (One. two, three, four, open up the fucking door.).
the crowd was finally allowed into the hall.

After another half hour, the concert began with the Three Rivers
Blues Band, a local group. Faintly reminiscent of Chicago, the group
offered some fair renditions of a number of songs. The high point of
their part of the program was a powerful version of Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young’s Ohio.

Big Brother and the Holding Company were next to take the stage.
Many in the audience were doubtful of the ability of this group whose
main claim to fame has been as a back—up band for Janis Joplin.

At the end of the third hard rock song. a short,’ rather round guy
appeared and picked up a mike. Before anyone in the audience could
figure out why he had come to the stage, Big Brother started another
song. Swaying the mike stand, banding over and generally moving about
the state, the newest addition began to sing some incredibily sweet

The rest of Big Brother’s music followed this blues line. To say
their performance was great would almost be understating the point.
When they finished their last song, the surprised audience came to
their feet and screamed for more.

Big Brother moved back to the stage and put forth what many con-
sidered the best song of the evening, I’ll Change Your Flat Tire Merle.
This good old down south foot stomping song was the perfect way to
end a great performance. “Your a honky, I know, but Merle you got

The James Gang had to be good to follow such an outstanding per-
formance. And they were. A mixture of Grand Funk and Led Zepplin.
the group was composed of three gifted musicians.

The lead guitarist could make his instrument sound like a huge
pipe organ, the bass guitarist, at one point, was playing his guitar like
a lead guitar, and the drummer put out the incredible beat that moved
the group’s music forward.

Everything about them was perfect and when they quit playing.
the crowd again came to their feet. But this time there were no results.

After such a great evening of music, the events that followed the
concert seemed almost tragic. When the music was over, gangs of
high school students stormed the Mosque. causing about $700 of dam-
age by breaking windows and committing other types of vandalism. Its
just too bad that an evening of utopian music had to be accompanied by
such realistic, common occurances.

The appearance of Exuma as Wednesday eve-

interesting experience as the exotically clad group
used ankle bells. whistles, and a bass drum to en-
chant most of the audience.

In the end there were mixed reactions to the
concert. Most of the stoned freaks were completely
enchanted with Exuma’s Student Union Ballroom

It’s 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.

It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing radius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-
gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never
seen inside the Beetle.

In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose milid-mannered ox-
terlor masks its ‘true identity, a new name.

We call it SUPER BEETLE. '

A °If you must go, take   a Bag o’ Laughs’ A 

by PAT O’BRIEN

Love Story, as you probably know. is a
phenomenal box office success; it grossed
over two million dollars during its first
three days of nationwide release. At the
Warner they wait in the cold four and five
deep along Fifth Ave. and around the cor-
ner on Wood St. halfway to Forbes.

The theater reported to Variety a first
week haul of “WOW 60G." a figure re-
flecting both unprecedented popularity and
an unprecedented ticket price of $3 per
weeping patron.

Love Story has become an event. a sight
to see. like Three Rivers Stadium. People
go just to say that they have been there.
Even those who would normally avoid such
a picture are going to examine the evi-
dence first hand.

I can think of two people who would not
line up with the pack. They are Oliver Bar-
rett, IV, and Miss Jennifer Cavilleri, the
couple in Erich Segal’s novel.

It has seemed to me that in the great
novels and even in the good bad ones. one
can expect the characters. were they real
people, to read and respond favorably to

the works in which they appear.

But I cannot imagine O1‘ and Jenny
spending an hour on Love Story. These Bar-
retts. he. a millionaire Harvard magna
and jock who believes “an hour in Dillon
Field House is worth two in Widener Li-
brary." and, she. a Radcliffe magna, who
memorized all of the Mozart Kochel list-
ings. and would not spend a evening with
“friends" because she could not stand
"bullshitting with a bunch of vapid prep-
pies." would not waste time on a book that
was supposed to be about how much a cou-
ple loved but could not specify the ways.
They were not Barretts for nothing. Segal
had. created characters superior to his
book. I can hear Jenny roaring “Bu1lshit“
right now.

Still, Jenny did have some good lines,
and even though I knew what a fraud it
was, I went to the Warner expecting a de-
cent commercial picture. As I left the’ the-
ater I mentally updated a line of Oscar
Wilde’s. Anyone who could watch the death
of Jenny without laughing must have a
heart of stone. Only the most deadened
soul could mourn the passing of a ‘creature
that never had life. ’

The movie makers probably thought
that a real Harvard detail would be unfami-
lar to a mass audience. Just shoot in the
Yard and let it go at that. So we have Ryan
O'Neal as Oliver. Saying “Negative" in-
stead of “no" and sporting a Brooks Broth-
ers wardrobe is not enough for him to pass
as heir to millions; he is still the boy
from “Peyton Place.” The script fits this
boy next door approach.

Ali plays Jenny the same way. which is
worse because she has the snappy lines.
From her they sound flat. She does not
have the aggressiveness which supposedly
took Miss Cavelleri from her father’s bak-
ery in Cranston, R. 1., to the mansion in
Ipswich. Mass. Ali has never said goodbye
to Columbus. i

There are no other characters. A few
people pop in and out from time to time
but we learn nothing about them. Ryan
and Ali are alone on the big screen. Direc-
tor Arthur lliller does not help. He does
not display a shred of talent.

He tells us that they are struggling by
having her make him peanut butter sand-
wiches on the Law School steps. The brand
is Skippy. and is visible long enough to

'Good enough to crylabout’

by TOM NETTER

"What can you say about a 24
year old girl who died?"

 . . live is never having to say

 you‘re sorry. . Ti?)

Believe it or not. these are di-
rect quotations from Eric Segal’s
Love Story.

Is this Eric Segal, perennial
loser of the Boston Marathon,
weekend architect of‘ yellow sub-
marine, recent millionaire and
Yale Classics professor. . . . Is
this Segal’s Believe It or Not? Is
this Segal’s Greek chorus we find
on the first page of this little
classic, telling us where we are
and where we are going? Could
this book be prophetic‘?

Eric has
classic.

written a modern

Eric has made everyone cry.
He has thrust into this dark age of
ours a hopeful ray of romantic-
ism. Eric has shown us light

where others only show us dark.

Eric’s little (or Little Eric’s)i

novel is just plain great. It ought
to be. He rewrote it 30 times.
Thirty times he lived his love
story, 30 ’times he cryed over
sweet college days and the hard
work to get into grad school, 30
times he wrote and rewrote his
lovable characters as they fight
their way up through the terrible
world that tries to put them down.

And 30 times Eric Segal lifted
his characters to the epiphany of
epiphanies~—success. Then dias-
ter strikes. In a scene reminiscent
of Romeo and Juliet only the good
Monk is left without a Kleenex.

In just a few lines, reminiscent
of the style used in Edge of Night,
Eric Segal has developed the new
Everyman’s Classic, something
for everyone. His characters have
a magical quality of gilded card-
board. or a modern soap novel.

How does he do this? There are

.. two basic qualities to Eric Segal’s

book worth mentioning. First off,
he has managed through his plot
to make everyone forget about
such non-essential items such as
writing craft, language, style,
character development, the novel,
art . . .

Secondly. Eric really shows that
he is on the ball. In an age of mass
apathy (Right on Eric), in an age
of total alienation (Far out Eric),
in a time of mental pollution and
moral vacousness (Outtasight
Eric) he has managed to draw
people out of their little egotisti-
cal pidgeon holes (beyond peri-
pheral vision Eric) and makes
them feel some real, honest to
God theraputic sentimentality!

See Eric. He may just become
as great a folk hero/traditional-
ist as. say, Rod McKuen.

Now isn‘t that wonderful. It‘s
so wonderful you might want to
go and have a good cry over it.

JERRY RICHEY
Breaks Mile Record

Swimming
Complaints

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

 

The Pitt—Kent State dual meet
at the Field House Saturday was
a record breaking one. Three old
Field House marks fell and one
was tied as Pitt defeated, Kent
State 64-44. Kent State set one
mark. while Pitt shattered two.

Jerry Richey. coming off a
one—day flue attack last week.
set a new indoor record in the
mile run. with a 4:052 clocking.
Richey‘s run was the first compe-
tition for him this season and
the result left him very happy.

"I was plenty satisfied". re-
marked Richey. “considering
that I did it in the first meet.
That left me satisfied. I sup-
pose."

At the Field House, Richey’s
previous best was 4:07.1.

Smittie Brown. who already
held the Field House record in
the 600-yard—run broke his old
record of 1:10.1 with a time of
1:09.8. His new record didn‘t
surprise Brown much.

“Well. I'm in the best shape
that I’ve been in my whole life".
analyzed Brown. “I wasn‘t too
surprised because I thought I
was ready."

(The Washington CYO meet)

I wasn’t relaxed. I doubted my-
self. Here I was relaxed."

The relaxed Brown had an
inkling that a new record might
be coming his way.

“After the first lap, I knew
I was going fast. It was just a
matter of finishing.” Dorel Wat-
ley finished second to Brown in
the 600 with a time of 1:10.0 and
would have also broken Brown’s
old mark had Brown not better-
edit.

Watley also ran well in the
mile relay. His time (48.9) was
the best he has done to date.
The mile relay team won the
relay with a 3 : 18.6.

Kent State sophomore Al
Schoterman also broke a field
House record in the 35 lb.
weight. Schoterman, who was
fourth in the event last year in
the NCAA's had a throw of
62ft.-31/iin.

effort from Shoterman.

Harrison Sparks Cats 
In Victory Over Lions if

by MARTY HELLMAN ~ K

The Pitt Panthers picked a perfect time to
have their worst shooting game of the season
Saturday night at the Field House. Despite hit-
ting on only 39 percent of their attempts. the
Panthers managed to whip the equally poor
shooting Lions. 75-62. before a crowd of 2.382.

Both squads missed numerous field goal tries
throughout the game and were unimpressive in

About two weeks ago a pair of Pitt swimmers made pub-
lic their complaints about Grant’s handling of his position.
They even mentioned that Al Morris’ true reasons for quit-
ting were more than the “official” reply of disgust with the
sport.

And Morris agreed, saying that he left the team because
of the coaching, or lack-of-it, from Grant.

The complaints weren’t unusual. Many athletes have
moaned about many coaches in the past—and for the same rea-
sons. It’s almost like a recording:

“The coach doesn’t know a thing about the sport. . . He
doesn’t teach you anything. He doesntrecruit. He
doesn’t give enough scholarships. . . etc."

But there was a new angle to the swimmers’ grievances.
These guys were actually willing to have their names con-
nected with accusations —— in print.

Morris, of course, was free of possible retaliation from
his coach, but the other two—Rick Rowe and Mark Cohen—— . ._ .
would have to face their coach after the story was released. the” offensive attacks"

but conclusions for the situation
weren't easy to discover.

“I don't think anyone on our

Lewis mentions. "Even Cleve-

has _a large Black population.”

The Minor League system of
professional baseball prevents
college baseball programs from
expanding and attracting much
attention-—or financial backing
from the athletic departments.
Thus, recruitment is affected.
At Pitt, for instance, approxi-
mately 60 per cent of Lewis’
players are walk-ons.

difficult to recruit the athlete
you desire in these less-publi-
cized sports.

 

   

Pitts soccer coach Leo Bemis
prefers to refer to the minor
sports as “non-revenue-" sports.
and that designation reveals the
reason more monies aren't
thrown into recruitment for base-
ball, soccer. swimming. etc.

“It’s a realistic approach,”
Lewis reasons. . “You pour
your finances into the sports

that are going to make money.”

believes that he
could recruit suitable Black
soccer players if there were
many in the market of high
schools in the area. Most of
his boosters come from the 10-
cal suburban soccer schools
like Fox Chapel and Springdale.
or from the New Jersey area, a
locale that seems to be rich
with soccer talent.

Bemis still.

“There are so few high
schools in the district with Black
soccer players,“ Bemis says.

"You can't find any at places
like Fox Chapel. Then, I like to
look

into New Jersey. ‘They

  
  
   

     

   
 

one on their All-State team was
Black."

The problems coaches Lewis
and Bemis face are similar to
those of all of Pitt’s ‘non-
revenue’ mentors. But, with
the BAS charges remaining in
their thoughts, the coaches ap-
pear to agree with their boss,
Athletic Director Casimir Mys-
linski, who says he wants the
better athletes—and will not re-
cruit a Black simply because

V he is Black.
“Ill try to get the best play- «,-

ers.“ Bemis says. “If you don‘t
win— even~in the non-revenue
sports—you are subject to criti-
cism. so you recruit the best
you can.“

Lewis concurs and carries the
reasoning a little further.

“I don‘t think an athlete
would want to come here that
way." the baseball coach says.
“It would be hard on him. In
baseball you go basically with
your starting nine, and it‘s hard
knowing you’ll always be sitting

on the bench never playing

Pitt wrestling coach Dave

Adams hopes to "Get back on‘

the winning track" with his
team’s match at Indiana State
University tomorrow.

The grappler’s two-match un-
defeated streak was broken last
week by Navy, and the coach
wants his team to be back in
winning form for their match
with top rated Michigan Satur-
day.

Last season the matmen trounc-
ed Indiana, 46-0. taking seven
pins. two decisions and one for-
felt.

“I don‘t know what to expect
from them." Adams said, "But
they expect to be better.

“We should win. Were using
our better people to get them
back on the right track.“

Adams has re-worked his line-
up to fill in the gaps left by a
recent wave of injuries and
freak circumstances.

Steve Weiss, last years Navy
Plebe tournament champion. at
118 is out for the season with
a knee injury.

.Mark Payne was barred from

not yet “ready" to wrestle.

When asked if Payne would

In °Consistent’ Meet

The Pitt gymnastic team scored more points (139;50l th8n_1h€‘."
have in three years. but they still tell to Springfield College. 158.15-

139.50.

Contrary to what the score might indicate Pitt was still in conten-
tion to win the meet after four events were completed. They trailed by

only a little over seven points.

"We hit what we did in every event?‘ stated Richard Pribis who
scored a career high of 8.45 in the free exercise.

Seven other personnel highs
were recorded. Ed Swerdlow and
Lowell Meek both set two person-
al highs each in the meet, Swerd-

ww in the free “ex” and vaulting
and Meek on the rings and high
bar.

The coaches were most pleased
with captain Mike Beatty‘s high
of 8.55 on the side horse.

"Being behind Springfield. last
years college division gymnastic
champion. is quite an accomplish-
ment for a Pitt gymnastic team.“
commented Bob Dodson. Pitt as-
sistant coach.

But the comment every Pitt
gymnast mentioned was the con-
sistency in scoring. On only two
performers was there a discrep-
ancy of more than one point be-

tween the high and low score of
the judges.

There are four judges who
score each performer on his rou-
tine. The high and low score is
thrown out and the middle two
scores are averaged for the final
score.

“I was very much pleased with
the scoring.“ Dodson said. "In
Pittsburgh you will find as much
as a four point difference between
the scores. "

"But . I feel that our potential
has not been reached yet.“ added
Pribis. "If we get it together and
really work we can beat West Vir-
ginia Wednesday and Kent State
Saturday. and quite possibly have
a winning season.“

However. spurred on by Rod-

Econ lead was trimmed to 51-49.

Nevertheless. Econ did not

the last 30 seconds of play.

The MBA’s, controlling the of-
fensive boards throughout most
of the contest, failed to take ad-
