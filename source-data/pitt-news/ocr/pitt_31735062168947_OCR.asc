a meaningful role in civil rights
legislation.

In a statement circulated to.
presidents of member colleges.
the directors of the Association
said they believed “most students
are committed to respect for per-
sonal rights. as the essence of a
democratic society. and to the
free exchange of ideas, as the life-
blood of the academic enterprise.

Some. however. the statement
said. are “skeptical about existing
channels for presentation of their
criticisms“; a minority may be
“driven by frustrations or their
own special philosophy into a re-
volt against academic institutions.
which they define as props and
tools for the establishment."

Bufwack’
Suit Makes
NoProgress

Four months have elapsedsince
the United States Postal Service
and the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation allegedly tried tampering
with Mary Bufwack’s mail. Since
then the suit filed against them
by the University co-ed has not
even reached the hearing stage.

The suit contends that since the —

beginning of April to the filing
of the charges. mail in Miss Buf-
wack’s post office was torn open .‘

The $250,000 that the suit is ask-
ing is “arbitrary.” commented the
senior. “The suit is the important
thing, not the sum.”

The reasons behind the alleged
tampering remain a mystery. Both
Kenny and McClennen plead ig-
norance. The claimant herself is

also mum. “Anyway,” she averred,

“the merit of the case is supposed
to depend only on the opening of
the mail, not on the reasons he-
hind it.”

Miss Bufwack. who plans to
graduate in December, 1968.
claimed as recently as Sunday af-
ternoon that “I have no concep-
tion of winning or losing. The
case could be dismissed. Even if
it is held over, I really don’t know
what winning consists of.”

New Location, New Concept of ‘Its Role

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

Things are really changing at
the Language Lab. The Lab has
a new director. a new location. a
new concept-of its role as an aid
to language—learning. and a lot of
new plans.

Amid contrapuntal hammering’
in the background. the new Lab
director, John Knudsen. recently
imported from New York Univer-
sity, described the p e n din g
changes and the precipitating rea-
sons for them.

“We are facing two big prob-
lems,” b e g a n Knudsen. “First.
there’t the attitude of students and
faculty. They have every right
to complain about the s e r v i c e .
they’ve been getting. The Lab has
a terrible reputation.

Secondly, there are technical
and procedural difficulties, main-
ly equal to money. The equip-
ment that we have has been mis-
handled over a number of years,”
he continued.

Knudsen believes that a re-eval-
uation of the role of the Lab may
be a possible solution to the prob-
lem.

“Now, faculty members and stu-
dents think of the Lab as an ap-
pendage,” he complained. “But.
a Language Lab should not be
considered secondary. It should

be thought of as another text-
book.”

The new director would even

change the name of the lab to

conform to this conception of it.

“A ‘Recording Materials Library’ '

would be a better term,” he pro-
posed. “It would be a place where
both student and teacher proceed
together, using the Lab as a teach-
ing aid. Thetapes would be the
equivalent of ‘reserve reading’ in
a library.’’

a The new orientation of the Lab
will be reflected in other ways.
as well. The preparation and edit-
ing of tapes will be facilitated by
the addition of new equipment. A
second change will be the integra-
tion of faculty members into the
operation of the Lab.

“As it stands, most faculty
members want as little as possible
to do with the Lab. They throw
the coordination”'and control of
programs onto the Lab.“ said
Knudsen.

A third major and far-reaching
innovation, according to the direc-
tor, “will be to hire native speak-
ers to help students with their lan-
guage studies. The plan is to have

certain hours of the day with a .

French moderator on duty, cer-
tain times with a Spanish one,
etc.”

He was hasty to point out that
“it will be assistance. not teach-
ing. In this way. we’lll be going
a library one better. In the long
range, the Lab will also be a train-
ing ground for future language
teachersf’

The Lab presently is still under-

New

going renovations at its new loca-
tion, the old Dental Clinic on
Thackery St. Since the “repairs
were more extensive than antici-
pated;” the Lab will not be open
for service until later in the se-
mester." as soon as financially
possible.”

 P   L.A. Debacle i

A For three years, Pitt football has been traveling down a

4 7*one‘-way street—the wrong way. Now it has reached a dead

end, a blind alley, and the only way out is to reverse direc-

; tzon. Evaluate what is really wrong with the football pro-

gram here and correct it.
The devastating humiliation of a 63-7 loss should never

in "."be; and in reality can be avoided if only a few simple and

cautious changes are instituted NOW.
The two biggest problems are these:

(1) The schedule, and
(2) The coaching.

For some strange reason, the athletic administration

, . -feels that Pitt can and should play national powers like Notre
 Dame, UCLA, -Miami of Florida, USC, and Oklahoma. But

except for the Jock Sutherland era (1924-1938), Pitt has never

- been a national powerhouse. In 1963, Pitt posted a 9-1 rec-

ord——the best mark of the sixties, the fifties,‘and the forties.
Since that year, Pitt—-students, faculty, alumni, admin-

in , ’ istrators, and anyone associated with the school—has been

ridiculed and humiliated beyond belief.

Why does Athletic Director Frank Carver continue to
schedule these teams? Why travel 3,000 miles to be humili-
ated? Why uphold a contract for money reasons when hon-
or and pride are at stake? And why must we~even have to

\ , answer these questions?

For one thing, Pitt has become more and more a Penn-
sylvania school; while these five powerhouses have open-
ed doors to football players from all parts of the country.‘

1 The scales do not balance now, and probably, they never
will.

A Man Standing For Truth;
A Man For A1l,,,Seasons

by PAUL STOLLER

In this year of Presidential untouchables many
students have lost their faith in our political pro-
cess. Many students take the very pathetic attitude
of “whatthe hell nothing matters anymore. What
can we do with Nixon in the White House.”

While Nixon may very well be in the White
House in January, there is something that all stu-
dents can do; we can fight and work for those can-
didates that ‘represent our views—men who are will-
ing to resist the popular whims of political expedi-
ency.

THERE ARE a few Senatorial candidates this
year who fall into this category, Paul O‘Dwyer.
Wayne Morse and Frank Church are all men of
courage—men who share the student dismay over the
war, the draft, and the ghetto.

But there is another man a bit closer to home
that shares these views. — _a man who has said that
“we can’t support the Saigon government.” And
that man is Senator Joseph S. Clark.

Sen. Clark is a rare politician, for he maintains
and independent mind in the face of the ever pre-
sent Democratic machine. Clark know that he needs
the support of the Democratic Party to win his quest
for Senate re-election. But he also know that he
must maintain his intellectual integrity. And this is

.. .THERE ARE many men in the Senate who call
themselves senators. but they really don’t fit into
that lofty classification. There are many men in
the Senate whose votes are dictated by the whims
of their distinct constituency. These men are call-
ed senators when, in fact, they are merely the slaves
of their voters dangling by the tenuous strings of
public opinion. Perhaps this is the reason why Pres-
ident Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage was merely
150 pages in length.

But there are exceptions to every rule. And Jo-
seph Clark is one man who stands up for what he
thinks is right in spite of the political conse-

The Acquiescence of, The Non-Radical

Student Cop-out Committee

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

My, my, my. Isn’t the Com-
mittee of Concerned Students ra-
dical. Hear them c_us_s, hear them
roar. Watch them rally together.
and them %watch them cop out by
wirting the chancellor a letter that
is totally lacking in thought, orig-
inality, or guts. From the account
I received of their umpublicized
rally. I wa s
h o p e f u 1 that
s o m ethin g
begin to
happen at this
University. But
then they came
out with aletter
that is a classic
example ‘of the
impotent advice
that students *   '
have been pasS- RQSENBLUM
ing on to the ad-
ministration. and that the Com-
mittee so vehemently abhors.

The Committee says that there
is a “grave deficiency” in the
University structure; big news.
The Committee says students have
no decision making power; also
_big news. They attack the Chan-
cellor much less vociferously than
they did at their gathering: a lack
of gumption maybe? The Com-
mittee‘ was hedging even before
they came to their “demands, " the
demands which will give students
“power -to determine policy in
significant areas of University
life.” Then their demands.

THEY SUGGEST that the stu-
dents will make decisions on po-
licies that are relevant to the stu-
dent in his particular field of in-
terest. Then they’ll take these de-
cisions and let an administrator
decide whether it should be pass-
ed or not. Let’s stop here. because
the committee has already’ fallen

"into the trap of the administra-

tion. So what if the students de-
cide there should be no curfews.
or that Dr. Doe is an incompe-
tent fool. If the administrator de-
cides he wants curfews or he
wants to keep Dr. Doe, then no
change will occur.

The only sanction thatthe com-

-_ : mitte_e‘=puts.on_ the administrator _
- ;135:is» .that he rnust explain thereason

for his decision, and that he must
arrive at his decision within two
weeks. Big deal! ! If that is the
only treat they are putting in the
face of the administration. then
the only thing they’ll hear is the
usual rosey—posey condescending
garbage about why the adminis-

_ tration know best. But the ‘bright-

eyed committee is certain that
their proposal will succeed be-
cause ‘_‘the general will of the stu-
dents directed toward the good of
the University will become law
unless the administrators ca n
point out genuine drawbacks and
flaws in the proposal." Doesn’t
the committee know by now that

‘the administration will only be in

favor of something that will be
beneficial to them, and not the
-students. I wonder how many 'stu-.
dents werein favor of having the
new dormitories built on top of
the hill where the cemetary is
now located. You’d better believe
that those dorms would have been
built there if it wasn’t for the fact
that the University could not get
permission to remove the graves.
Did they care what the students
wanted? The answer is self evi-
dent

The committee went on to cite
two areas they they deem to be of
significance to the students: so-
cial and housing regulations. and
academic policy. I will say -again
that the students do not need the
advice or help of a crusty admin-
istrator. The committee should
make it clear to the administra-
tors that they do not want. or
need. their advice on this subject.

THE PROBLEM of academic
policy is anotherarea where the

' students do not need the aid of the

administrators. The faculty and
the students are involved in the
learning process. so let the fac-
ulty and theiitstudents decide on
what should betaught. how it
should be taught. whether grades
should be given. how they should
be given. ’an gnylother matters
that either joup would care to
consider. and consider with equal
influence. , ‘

their letter. It should never have
been written from the desk of a
group devoted to gaining com-
plete rights for the students. The
committee, if it wishes to acheive

its goals, must be infinitely more "

volatile in their demands, and
they must concede nothing to the

- administration, Nothing. I’m sure

that this committee is not naive
enough to expect the administra-
tion to acceed to their demands
with only the empty. pressure of
words. They must use more overt
actions.

The committee stated that 250
people were at their unannounced
rally. If it had been announced.
there would have been more. It
only took 100 students to influ-
ence the administration at North-
western by means of peaceful dis-
obedience. I hope the committee

knows, because the administration ,

certainly does, that 250 students
would be more than sufficient at
Pitt. But, my dear committee, the
important thing to remember is
that the administration will never.
ever, help you. They will only
continue, as they always have, to
hinder and stall.

Revamp SG ‘Representation’

Editor. The Pitt News:

Last Wednesday. I witnessed
what I could simply call a de-
bacle — the Student Government
meeting. For nearly three hours
our “representative” senators ar-
gued over points which affect 8.-
000 students of this University.
These 25 elite decided on many
future activities and objectives of
this student body including the
important matter of “Student Pow-
er” without once asking students.‘
opinion.

During and after the meeting I
received many comments. The
most incredible was raised to me
by a cute young lady representa-
tive when she said that the issues
were passed or defeated by the
Student Governement, an auto-
nomous body of Senators oblivi-
ous to the wishes and demands of
the student body. I found it hard
to believe when she told me that
what the students wanted was un-
important for they could ignore
all the decisions if they so wish-
ed. Again I repeat her argument
that what we have is an autono-
mous body named the Student
Government, not a representative
Student Government which rep-
resents the student body. '~

' It is important for us to consi-
der a few important matters when
we think of the Student Govern-
ment. First, it is comprised of only
25 senators. Secondly, although
everyone is invited to attend, one
who is not a member of the senate
may speak only if the rules are
suspended by a two-thirds vote.

Thirdly, 2,300 incoming fresh-
men had no say in the election of
these senators; therefore, only 5,-
200 of 7,500 even had a chance to
vote, and I have strong suspicions
that many did not exercise their
option. A

I am not calling for abolish-
ment or even written condemna-
tion of the Student Government.
What I am calling for is a realiz-
ation that this organization which
so ‘loudly preaches equal and fair
representation is practicing the
highest form of hypocrisy by set-
ting up what is becoming an ex-
ceedingly strong “aristocracy.” I
was given some friendly advice
“to cool it” this evening at the
meeting because I would get my
chance next year.

My friend advised me that these
senators were pretty important
people who could be very helpful.
However, without any great altru-
istic claim, I am now calling for
the students of this University to
show their voice and strength and.

prohibit the Student Government
from becoming aristocratic.

It is time for the students to de-
mand a chance to speak openly at
all SG meetings.

It is time that more than ten or
15 students show up to’ witness
these meetings.

And most importantly it is time
for all the students to be allowed
to have an actual vote. not a rep-
resentative vo te, in important
matters affecting them.

Raise your voice — find the sen-
ators and let them know that their
policies are unfair and must be
changed.

Let SG President Ken Schue1-
er’s cry for student power become
a cry of all of the students of this
University. -

Quizzes Not
Valid Grade

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Pitt News has recently stir-
red much discussion concerning
the archaic ways of the Universi-
ty and the changes‘ needed to
make Pitt a better place for learn-
ing. We feel that one of the places
a change is needed is the area of
“home assignments,’,’

We were under the impression
that this kind of work is given to
develop proficiency and know-
ledge in a subject; not that they
were meant to be nightly quizzes
often counting as much as 25 per
cent of the final grade in a course.
Shouldn’t a student be allowed to
experiment and find solutions to

. problems without being penalized

for the lack of _a competency he is
supposed to be acquiring?

If teachers want to insure that
assignments are worked out and
tried by the students, they could
do this by giving only one type of
grade: either for trying the as-
signment or not. This would not
penalize the student who really
wishes to try. ' .

Unitl this _ happens, desperate
students will continue to resort to
copying from others -— not trying
the work themselves.

LETTER POLICY

9 fréshing to read last Wednesday’s

Letters to the Pitt News must

 carry the full name of the write-
 er and the signee’s chool or ad-
§dress. Letters should be type-
 written, triple-spaced, and 200
 words or less.

All letters are subject to con-

§densation by the editors-, and
 any letter which tends to libel,
 scandalize, or falls outside the
 rules of journalistic ethics will
 not be published.

No pen names will be used, 

 I “naively” assume that the $1,-
;;;§ 500 which I annually pay for tui-
 tion is applied to the cost of main-
 taining this institution.

There’s a new girl on campus.
She’s really zoftie looking from
the front but a rear view is a mess.
All made—up in the front and a
cinder block complexion with
some erector set props upon her
behind. ’

Her insides are wild! Endless
walkways and secret passages that
are hard to get at and were built-
in for who-know-what reason. Her
back lobby could almost be used
for Friday night roller skating.
Her auditorium is divided into
two sections and it has a folding
door that folds back half the dis-
tance of the auditorium. That will
probably be great for acoustics!

When a film is shown from one
of the two projection-booths it ar-
rives on the mini-screens with a
keystone distortion effect. Cool!
This is so because the booths are
located neither in the center of
the auditorium halves nor in the
center of the entire auditorium it-
self. '

' Our new girl’s auditorium isn’t
wired for sound . . . after all she
only cost the State of Pennysl-
vania around two to three million,
dollars. The sound s y s t e m for
films consits of a wire that _dan-
gles from the Flash Gordon pro-
jection booth, to the floor (it’s that
easy to maintain rubber tile, you
know) and up to the olde sound
box on the stage (that has no stor-
age space).

Our girl has a grand total of
nine classrooms. At about 125,000

Editor, The Pitt News:
In some strange way, it was re-

student claims to participate in
University decision-making pro-
cedures are totally illegitimate.

One rarely encounters the spa-
cious reasoning of a simplistic in-
tellect backed by such certitude.

Mr.‘Alman contends: “The Uni-

- versity is a private institution. . . .

It is owned by private interests

her innards are now being knock-
ed about because her tenants nev-
er were consulted about her de-
sign. She is a monument to our
“developed” society. She is a pro-
duct of design, or mis-designing by
committee, State of Pennslyvania
construction practices, our Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh administra-
tion, inflation, a ridiculous archi-
tect who didn’t do his homework,
the State Legislature itself, and
who-know-what-else. She merits a
thorough investigation by an in-
dependent group of State Legisla-
tors and University of Pittsburgh
faculty members and administra-
tors and should be visited without
delay by GSPIA students who are
interested in learning we plan
and develop things here in our
advanced society.

 ‘ Los ANGELES- The scene here in
 the locker room of the Coliseum after
 losing to UCLA 63-7 was not a pretty
» Cone. Numerous half-clad bodies sat

 

,motionless in their dressing room stalls.

 - Tears welled behind the eyes of several
L beaten Panthers.

 In the corners of the room other mem-
 _' bers of the Panther contingent huddled to-
" . 'gether, murmuring about the previous three

 I But a head football coach is responsible
‘  for-answering for his team’s performance,

 

. tions. And they weren’t pretty either. They
were painful.

 

For UCLA, it was a great night. The

‘ "Uclans hadn't scored as many points since
1954 when they beat Stanford, 72-0. Indivi-
ually, Bruin kicker Zenon Andrusyshyn set

. a school record for conversions (9) and re-

and Dave Hart was there to answer the ques-

old record by throwing four touchdown’
pases.

Altogether, UCLA has now scored 160
points against Dave Hart-coached Panther
squads. But this year was supposed to be dif-
ferent. And up through the first quarter, it
was.

“The big thing, the turning point,” re-
viewed Hart, “came in the second quarter.
We were riding right on the crest of res-
pectability. It was 21-7 and we were on
UCLA’s 15-yard line.

“If we could have made it 21-14 or 21-
10 right before the half,” he conjectured,
“the sophomores would see that even as
jittery as they were, they were still in the
ball game. This was the crest of the col-
lapse.”

' Indeed it was. Gusty Dave Havern over-
threw tight end George Medich at the five-
yardline on third down, and Joe Spicko’s
field goal try from the 21 was wide to the
left. Sixteen plays later, and with only 15
seconds remaining in the half, UCLA scored
its fourth touchdown.

“Instead of it being 21-14 or 21-10 at
the half, it was 28-7 remarked Hart. “They
were ready for a collapse. You can discard

In the most practical sense, Hart
was right. The last 28 points were meaning-
less to the game's outcome. In fact, all the
second-half scoring followed’ offensive mis-

takes by the Panthers. But, there is still
the inescapable fact that UCLA scored 63
points. It just wasn’t supposed to happen
this year.

“I don’t think that was our football
team out there,” exhorted Hart. “We were

right mentally, but not physically. We haven’t
‘had any contact work in the last week be-

cause we were afraid of more injuries.”

Hart cited injuries to Frank Gustine,
Don Plusquellic, J.D.Lewis, and Howard

Broadhead as examples of what happens when
‘ a player falls behind in practice. Then the

coach offered another observation of the de-
fense.

“It looked like everbody was afraid
to make a mistake,” he said. “They were so
consciously trying to.avoid what happened
the last two years that they were too cau-
tious. They weren’t reckless. They didn’t
turn themselves loose.”

Defensive line play was practically'non-
existant. And so was the pass rush. Out of
over 90 offensive plays, UCLA quarterbacks
were only thrown for losses twice and run-

ners caught behind the line of scrimmage

three times. As a rusule, linebacker Ralph
Cindrich led the defense in tackles with 16
"and safety Bryant Salter was second with 6.

Offensively, the story was a little
brighter. Although only seven points were
scored, the Panthers moved the ball well
when passing and occasionally on the
ground.

“The receivers did an outstanding job,”
lauded Hart. “Havern did a great job.
Whether we were one touchdown behind or
five, he was still going after them.”

Actually, discounting Ron Cope1and’s
53-yard scoring catch, the Panthers outgain-
ed UCLA in the air, 165 yeards to 154.
The ground attack netted only 61 yards.

But in the first quarter, the Cats did
move the ball on the ground. On one series
of downs, tailback Denny Ferris carried
the ball six times out of eight plays and
gained (with the help of blocking fullback

* Jeff Brown) 22 yards. Then he hurt his hip.

Ferris carried the ball only two more times
the rest of the game, gaining 15 more yards.

The Panthers’ lone score came at the
end of a two-yard drive, set up by Ed Gal-

lin’s fumble recovery. It took the special two-

fullback offense three plays to get the score,
Jeff Brown finally diving over. It was one
of the few pretty scenes of the evening.

_If someone had mentioned the possitility of a 63-7 victory
for UCLA over the Panthers to any member of the Pitt en-
tourage Saturday before the game, they probably would have
been met with a response something like, “Yeah, and Walt
Disney was a Communist.”

I An observer might not have been able to put his
 finger on it, but he could have sensed something
,7_f was different about this team. Lottle was said at din-
 ner Saturday afternoon. No Joking. No laughing. Just

Discouraged. Upset. They felt they had been duped by all the fan-

V fare. 

But what about the players? What about Dave Hart, who’s work-
ed so damned hard just getting the football program to where he
thought he was seeing some daylight? They weren’t incensed and they
didn’t feel duped. They were downright embarassed. And shocked.

“It was like living through a nightmare,” commented Gary

V Cramer.

_ Most of the other players couldn’t begin to articulate their feel-
lings. But by Sunday, they began to realize that there was so sense

This writer chooses to believe that this year’s Panthers re-
main yet an unknown quantity. Even UCLA coach Tommy Pro-
thro said that his team wasn’t “56 points better. When a team gets
behind and has to come to you, you can’t tell much after that as

P ‘ . to how good they are.”

But there are people now at school that are ready to call for
the firing of Hart. This is a reasonable expectation in these days
of student activism and involvement. But give the man - and the
team - a chance.

Of course, you can’t just ignore a 56-point loss either. Some-
thing obviously went haywire Saturday night. Maybe everybody

just took UCL a little lightly because Gary Beban graduated,

Maybe there’s a more serious flaw in the team’s patterns: That re-
mains to be seen.

But every member of the squad will tell you that thereare still
nine games left this season. They aren’t giving up yet. To them, it’s
a matter of personal pride. To a man, they’re stunned and hurt
inside. And only then can redeem themselves. The talent’s there.

Can’t Believe
It Happened

“I can’t believe it. I just
can’t believe it,” EZ Ed Whit-
taker repeated over and over.

Whittaker, Panther tri-captain
and stalwart on the offensive line,
sat in his room Saturday night
listening to his teammates go
down to defeat at the hands of
UCLA. Whittaker’s knee injury
had kept him from making the trip
to the coast, yet it appeared his
heart must have been in Califor-
nia Saturday night.

“I felt worse sitting there listen-
ing to the game and knowing what
those guys were going through,”
explained EZ. “I know they didn’t
expect it, expecially the sopho-
mores. I know how they feel and
how they’re going to feel. I can’t
really explain it, but I know they’
re going to feel so bad they won’t
even want to come back to cam-
pus.

“It was really difficult sitting
there listening,”, continued the sen-
ior from Mineral Ridge, Ohio,
“and I felt bad that I couldn’t
be there helping out. Dave Mon-
trella and Lou Parrott and I just
sat there and talked it over.”

Whittaker admits that the crush-
ing defeat will hurt the team for
a while, but he explains that they
should, be back up for West Vir-
ginia. “

“West Virginia is not near
the team UCLA is. When we go out
there and run a few plays against
them and see they’re not UCLA.
we’ll get the confidence back.

Ed is confident about his own
chances for West Virginia as well.
“I hope to be ready Saturday. I
want to play real badand there’s
a good possibility I will. After
last night (Saturday,) I’m gonna
play one way or another.”

Flashy Havern Among  
Few Panther Highlights -2»
In West Coast Debacle

by JERRY L. BRUEBEL

For many of the college football teams across the country,

this past week-end marked the beginning of another season.

For many sophomore gridders, it marked the beginning of a
dream. But sophomore quarterback Dave Havern’s dream be-

came a nightmare Saturday night in the Coliseum.

“I’d just like _to forget it,” moan-
ed Havern thinking about Satur-
day night’s 63-7 embarrassment,
“I’d just like to forget it, and get
ready for West Virgnina.”

The scrappy 5-8 signal—caller
was one of the few sophomores
that didn’t disappoint coach Dave
Hart. Havern finished the game
with 15 completions in 33 attempts,
for 165 yeards. But his effort
was in vain.

5 “We kept moving the ball,” ex-
plained the former Montour High
School standout with frustration.
“We kept moving and moving so
many times, but we just couldn’t
score.

“One time we missed a field
goal, and then once Joe (McCain)
dropped a pass in the end zone,”
continued Havern. “I think the
game could have been different
if we scored early.”

But the Panthers didn’t score A

early, started off by trailing 14-0,
and finished 56 points down.

“UCLA was so big and so quick,”
said Havern awed by the overpow-
ering Uclan eleven, “I just couldn’t
believe it. But this was no indica-
tion of our team.

‘.‘We were ready for them men-
tally, but not physically. They hit
hard, much harder than we ex-
pected. We expected to hurt them
physically.”

Few ‘Panthers did what was ex-

.pected of them, but Havern per-

formed well in the scarey Coli-
seum.

“The Coliseum really didn’t im- .

press me that much,” admitted
the flashy quarterback. “I don’t
know why. It was really just like
the colored pictures you see in
sports magazines. It was like a
dream.”

Havern has longed for the star-
ting varsity quarterback job since
last year and had more than earned
it in pre—season practices. But the
lightfooted scrambling didn’t work
for 63-7 losses.

“I’m really mad.” said Havern.
“It was like a nightmare.” “I know
what people are going to say:
that we’re no good. and all that.
But we’ll just have to prove them
wrong against WVU Saturday.
That game could make our whole

' season. If we win it, we’ll win the

next 5 or 6.”

Distancemen Romp In
TriangularCompetition

by BILL NAAB

“They all did a real good job. The meet went real great,”
exclaimed cross country coach Jim Banner. The fact that both
the varsity and freshmen squads overwhelmed their opposition,
in addition to the fact that Jerry Richey set a new course record
contributed to coach Banner’s enthusiasm.

The varsity distancemen were credited with 28 points, followed
by Ohio University’s 45, and Kent State’s 51. Also at Saturday’s triangu-
lar meet, sophomore Jerry Richey crashed the 4.2 mile course record.
He broke the Schenley Park course mark in a time of 20 minutes and
53.6 seconds. The old record of 21:09.0 was set in 1965 by Elmo Ban-
ton, an NCAA champion from Ohio University.

Kent State’s Norris and Cool-
idge trailed Richey with times of
21:10 and 21:22 respectively. Har-
rier Paul Zink,—22:03, came next.
Ohio’s Leedy ran in 22:54, while
distancemen Mike Nolan and
Greg Rodgers followed with times
of 23 seconds flat and 23:11. Two
Ohio University harriers ran the
eighth and ninth best_times. Do-
ing a good job despite a case of the
flu, Kenny Lawton rounder out the '
top ten with a 23:19 time.

In addition to praising flu-rid-
den Kenny Lawton, coach Banner
also had kind words for Zink, No-
lan, and Rodgers. “They were trem-
endous,” Banner commented. He
sophomores John
Aiken, even though he finished
out of the top ten.

“Aiken has been looking real
good in practice, and this was his
first varsity cross country meet,”
said the coach. Banner remark-
ed that Mark Vornhagen did not
run because of a bad ankle. He
also said that an achilles tendon
problem held Bill Matijasik from
the triangular competition.

As for Jerry Richey, “I knew
that he would have a good race,”
Banner stated. A long summer of
running at high altitudes and the
excellant competition from Nor-
ris» of Kent State were the two bas-

ic reasons for Banner’s optimism.
He spoke highly of Norris and cal-
led him one of the better distance
runners in the East.

Meanwhile, freshmen barriers de-
feated Kent State, 16-24. Bob Hag-
ner and Dave Cobb finished in a
first place tie in the time 13:45.
Tow more University distance-
men, Balky and Sapinza, follow-
ed Hagner and Cobb. They ran the
three mile course in times of 14:
07 and 14:21, as Fahl of Kent State
finished in fifth place.

Coach Banner expressed his
pleasure, “They did a pretty good
job. I’m real pleased.” When ask-
ed about a non-scholarship boy,
Dave Cobb, the coach commented,
“Cobb’s going to be a great run-
ner. He’s a good athlete. Cobb,
Hagner, Balky, and Sapinza are
the four outstanding runners on the
squad.”

He said that he’s also very pleas-
ed with Poust, who finished sixth.
Banner believes that his team out-
classed the squad from Kent
State and is eager to travel to Buf-
falo to oppose a tough Buffalo
State squad next Saturday. In
triangular competition, before the
freshmen meet, the varsity will
run against Buffalo State and
Bowling Green.

by ED CONLEY

LEWISTOWN —— Not long after the open-
ing kick—off, it was evident which way the

time was spent on getting it into the middle.
Bemis also had some complaints on his team’s

‘varsity soccer team’s opener here was going to go.
Bucknell’s Rod Burgess pushed the ball past Pan-
ther goalie Len Harmon and then collided with the
Pitt camptain, shaking him up momentarily.

A few mintues later, Bucknell’s Art Kurz slap-
lep his first of two penalty shots

play at midfield. “We held the ball too long at mid-
field. We should have passed to our wings,” the
mentor relates.‘ -

He had expected ball control to mean victory in
the game. but it didn’t work out that way.

The coach mentioned, “We were carrying the

beyond the reach of Harmon and '
the Bisons were on their way to
a 3-0 revenge of last year’s loss to
the Panthers.

There was little excitement in
the first half for the Pitt booters.
But, the last play of that half did
provide some thrill. Ian Baguley
booted a ball that he had rebound-
ed on the right side of the goal
just as the field announcer called
“Time!” The shot banged off the
right post, inches way from the

a.m.
goal.

Those interested in attending
the varsity soccer team’s game
against Wester Chester next
Saturday may sign up at the
Student Union Desk. A trans-
portation charge of 50 cents
must be paid. If a sufficient
number hasn’t signed up by Wed-
nesday at’ 5:00 p.m. all pay-
ments will be returned.

The game, at Fox Chapel High
School Field, will start at 10:30

ball at them, but we'll have to
work on shooting. We have to
shoot when we’re inside the 18,
rather than passing.’~’

The kickers were sotshot 19 to
16. despite the fact that they
were in control most of the time.
Bucknell was given only three
corner kicks compared to seven
booted by Pitt.

Bemis finally decided that the
loss came because “Bucknell did
what we should have been do-

The best opportunity for the booters in the sec-
ond half came when‘ Randy Dry grabbed a pass
slightly to the left of the Bison goalie.’ But, by the
time Dry had complete possession, and appeared
ready to shoot, one of the Bucknell Booters cleared

the ball.

There was also one penalty kick for the soccer-
men. It was booted by Conference Lekoma. The
ball bounded off goalie Bill Roberts, but came back
out to the playing field. Lekoma was there to get
the ball, but could not get a show away.

The only thing a disappointed Leo Bemis could
do was plan for the next game. He reviewed his
squad’s performance and came up with the conclu-
sion that “our success in scrimmage ruined us to-
day. We could go up the middle against the fresh-
men, but we couldn’t do it today.” .

The middle is where Bemis felt his team would .
‘be strong. Heknew he had the players to put the

 

mg.

Whenever Bucknell had possession, they got the
ball down to their wings as fast as possible and had
the big jumps. Great pressure was applied to the
varsity fullbacks, who were equal to the task. Wayne
Kaiser, in particular, was cited by his coach as
playing his best game since he’s been a varsity
player.

The loss now means that Bemis will have to work
his players this week. He has decided that condi-
tioning is still important. The strategy will be slight-
ly different this week, though. Instead of the usual
running, Bemis expects to increase the passing
drills. ‘‘They’ll be running that way, too,” the coach
says.

A great deal of that passing practice will be on
improving those going towards the middle in the
goal area. The next time out Bemis wants to be sure
that his players can get the ball in there.

students having any problems with
their interpersonal relationships
would feel more comfortable talk-
ing to these people. No such cadre
of personnel could be set up for
commuters with such problems,but
they are of equal concern to Dr.
Thompson. Aid is always avail-
ble through the Dean of Students
and the Health Service is always
open to them for both medical and
psychiatric advice.

Such service would be availa-
ble, too, for students who have no
interpersonal relationships. These
students constitute just as great a
problem to the Health Service as
those who have let their relation-
ships get out of hand.

Dr. Thompson went on to stress
that the “cadre of ten to twenty
women students who would be
well distributed throughout the
dorms” that be proposed to SG
was not to be a group for the pur-
pose of distributing birth co.- 01
information, rather a group such
as that outlined above, consist-
ing not of students at all. This he
feels would be instrumental in
preventing pregnancies; In case
a pregnancy actually occurs, Dr.

Thompson urged that these stu-
dents come for help to the Health
Service.
