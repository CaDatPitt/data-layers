Pi

lambda Phi collects

old clothing for charity

By Matt Gr-off
Staff Writer

In its latest efforts to help Pitt
students make an impact on
the lives of needy people in
Pittsburgh, Pi Lambda Phi
sponsored a clothing drive on
Monday and Tuesday._

The clothes will go to the
Jubilee Kitchen, a shelter and
distributor of food and clothing
on Fifth Avenue in the Hill
District. Representatives from
the fraternity will deliver the
clothes this weekend, along
with groceries bought from the
proceeds of their pumpkin sale
held in October.

“This project is part of our
continuing support to the
Jubilee Kitchen,” fraternity Vice
President Josh Sears said. “It is
something that was started
recently, and we’re trying to
make it a tradition.”

In the past, the fraternity has
sponsored charity drives as
well as collecting extra food
from North Oakland restaurants
and delivering it to the shelter.

I According to Sears, who is in
charge of philanthropy for Pi
Lambda Phi, the fraternity is
hopeful that the clothes and
food will help ease the heavy
demand that charity organiza-
tions such as the Jubilee
Kitchen experience during the
holidays.

Pitt students brought all
kinds of clothing to the booth,
which was located in the con-
course area of the William Pitt
Union. -

“It’s a shame some people
are just too lazy to give to a
project like this,” said Kristin
Wilker, a first—year Pitt student
and sweatshirt contributor.
“Everyone has something they
won’t wear again, and some-
body else would really appreci-
ate it.”

Sears said there is still more
clothing to pick up from peo-
ple who were not able to bring
it to the booth.

Anyone willing to donate
items of clothing is encouraged
to contact Pi Lambda Phi as
soon as possible.

Freshman

Extensive recycling on the
Pitt campus is one thing the
Freshmen Council plans for the
near future.

The council is trying to work '

with Carnegie Mellon, which
already has an extensive recy-
cling program. * ’ ‘
Council member Erin Coffield
has been talking with CM’s
recycling coordinator to
explore the possibilities of Pitt
joining CM’s recycling plan.

“A lot of people were com-_

pl-aining about -having recy-
cling, like glass and newspa-
per,” Coffield said. “We’re tying
to combine efforts [with CM].”

She said CM may be interest-
ed in splitting the costs of recy-
cling and sharing the resources
with Pitt. CM also recycles old
telephone books and student
directories on a limited basis.
Residence hall recycling is part
of CM’s work-study program,
which Coffield said could be an
idea at Pitt.

This is the wave of the
future. Soon students won’t
have to use microfiche or film
cartridges because the full
text will be there on the
screen. ProQuest is a larger
version of the InfoTrac sys-
tem which contains around
400 titles covering the
humanities and social sci-
ences, Whitmore said.

The Educational Resources
Center (ERIC) database is

popular because it covers the
field of education by indexing
over 700 periodicals and hun-
dreds of thousands of
research reports.

“The great part about these
databases is programs such as
MathSci which cover interna-
tional research literature in
mathematics, computer sci-
ence, statistics  applications
in physics, engineering and

See Library, page 5

Council plans future

Council President Todd
Neufeld said that many campus
organizations are concerned
about recycling, but the
Freshmen Council may be the
first to show results by working
with CM.

Projects centering around stu-
dent safety and social involve-
ment were also on the council’s
agenda at its weekly meeting
last night.

Neufeld said the council is

‘preparing safety number cards

for the student body. The lami-
nated cards, about the size of a
credit card, will contain emer-
gency-phone numbers.

First—year students were
urged to become more
involved in student govern-
ment. ‘D

“When I came here, I thought
that student government was 
above everybody’s head, with
all these unbelievable, amazing,
strong leaders,” Neufeld said.
“But when I got here I realized
it’s‘ really a smaller, close-knit
group of people who really
want to do things.”

The council, which meets
Tuesday nights, addresses
problems faced by new stu-
dents at Pitt and works with
current and future Student
Government Board members.

Treasurer Sheela Mirmira
encouraged Pitt’s first-year stu-
dents to talk to the council.

“We want to let freshmen
know that we’re open to their
comments,” she said.

The council gives a “fresh
attitude” to SGB, Neufeld said.

“We get to see things that are
going on that [SGB] might over-
look,” Neufeld said. “We can
look at things a different way 
with a fresh outlook.”

Members of the council are

_ encouraged to sign up for SGB

standing committees and intern
with a board member.

“We’re an orientation to
Student Government Board for
freshmen coming in,” Neufeld
explained. “It gives us a chance
to get to know what really goes
on in student government.”

Neufeld said he invites SGB

ESC president voted to national council

By Mike Laughlin
Staff Writer

Jeannette Johnson, president of Pitt’s
Engineering Student Council (ESC), was
recently elected president of the National
Association of Engineering Student
Councils (NAESC).

Johnson, a junior civil engineering major,
was elected president of the association at
a national conference held Oct. 22 through
25 at Purdue University in Illinois. It was
there that the association was first incorpo-
rated as a non—profit organization under a
new constitution. .

“I want to make sure we establish our-
selves as an organization,” she said.

As president of ESC, Johnson presides
over the weekly council meetings and goes
to alumni and clean meetings. She also
coordinates activities between departments
and plans social and academic events.

Johnson calls herself a spokeswoman for

- engineers and wants to make the university

aware of Pitt engineers.
Her job as president of the NAESC
includes chairing the executive board,

which consists of seven national represen-
tatives from different geographic areas.
Johnson coordinates the activities of
NAESC’s five directors, each of whom is in
charge of a different area: finance, commu-
nication, administration, public relations or
directing national conferences.

“The main reason I got the job is because
I’m organized,” Johnson said.

For the time being, NAESC will be com-
municating with ESCs all over the country
through E—mail. Johnson said it will be up
to her where to have the organization’s
next face—to—face national conference. Fund
raising will be a major goal of NAESC’s first
year of incorporation.

One of the reasons for incorporating
NAESC was to set up a structure that would
be more accessible to schools and compa-
nies that want to contact the association.
It was also meant to increase communica-
tion, improve coordination and plan pro-
grams and ‘events between individual coun-
cils.

“[Alsol, we want to help out smaller
schools who want to start student coun-
cils,” Johnson said.

The

Marilyn Ross, co-director of

the intramural and recreation
department, explained that
the new equipment is a re-

show held on campus last
semester. ,

“The Pitt Ambassadors
donated $2,500 for the new
equipmen‘t,”“Ross said. “And
the SGB and President Gil
Golden also donatedcmoney
from ticket sales of the body-
building competition held at
Soldiers and Sailors last
March.”

‘ Ross also said that the Pitt
Ambassadors were helpful in
purchasing the equipment at
a discount.

“Art Bedway, a member of
Pitt Ambassadors, was able to

purchase the equipment at a
tremendous discount for us,”
Ross said. “He is a profession-
al bodybuilder and was a

buying the equipment.

“He also offered to buy any

additional equipment when-.

ever SGB funds are available
in the future. He was a big
help.”

The Pittsburgh Super-
computing Center, a joint ven-
ture between Pitt, Carnegie
Mellon and Westinghouse, has
become the first non—govern—
mental recipient of what may
be the world’s most powerful
computer system.

“lThe system] will enable
researchers to make discoveries
that will profoundly shape the
world of tomorrow — the qual-
ity of our science and the qual-
ity of our lives,” Pitt Chancellor
J. Dennis O’Connor said.

The estimated $30 million
supercomputer, known as the
Cray Y-MP C90, is the latest in
a series of high—end, high-
priced machines the center has
acquired since its opening in
1986.

Michael Schneider, a
spokesperson at the center,
said that the new computer
and the center will help pro-
vide scientists across the coun-
try with the computing
resources they need to tackle
signiﬁcant challenges in chem-
istry, biology, physics and engi-
neering. ,

tall and is configured in an oval
shape and connected to a
bench that wraps around it. It
can perform 16 billion calcula-
tions per second and can store
256 million words (two billion
bytes) of memory. An inert
Freon fills the inside of the sys-
tem to keep the computer’s
components from overheating.

“The C90 will be a national
resource that will enable acade-
mic and industrial scientists and
engineers to tackle problems of
a range and depth they
couldn’t attempt before,” said
Ralph Roskies, .co—director of
the center and a professor of
physics at Pitt. .

Robert Mehrabian, president
of Carnegie Mellon, said the
computer is “the most powerful
in the world.”

More than 5,200 researchers
at more than 400 universities
have already accessed the cen-
ter’s resources via electronic
networks.

“The new system will bring
heavier computing and simula-
tion capabilities, along with

faster results to these
researchers nationwide,”
Schneider said.

‘Smithtown’ wins award for Raghavan

By Chrissy Cullen
Staff Writer

By developing an imagi-
nary town, “Smithtown,” Pitt
researcher Kalyani
Raghavan won an award for
her software program that
teaches students economics
with a computer program.

“The main purpose of this
project was to find out how
students learn in this kind
of discovery environment,”
Raghavan said.

“Smithtown,” the name of
the program, features sub-
ject matter encouraging stu-
dents to learn b_asic eco-
nomic skills by working
through the program on
their own. By analyzing the
market place and discover-
ing for themselves a way to

0 change the imaginary town,

this program encourages
students to work on their
reasoning skills, Raghavan
said.

Named after the father of
economics Adam Smith,
“Smithtown” was created for
use in introductory high
school or college courses. It
is part of the “Discovery
World” project.

The project’s focus is not
only on economics but also
on geometrical optics and
electricity. The purpose of
the project was the same in
all three branches,
Raghavan said.

Raghavan was granted the
award by the 1992
EDUCOM Higher Education
Software Awards program
which recognized
“Smithtown” as being
instructional, innovative and
the best social sciences soft-
ware.

“I am happy that the
effects have proved fruit-
ful,” said Raghavan, who
was presented with a $4,000
check and a trophy during
the EDUCOM national con-

ference Oct. 29-31 in
Baltimore, Maryland.

At the conference she will
demonstrate “Smithtown”

_where it will be one of 11

winners featured in a video-
tape produced by EDUCOM
for potential commercial
developers.

She was recruited to work
on the project when joining
the Learning Research
Development Center in
1986. Other contributors to
“Smithtown” were Robert
Glaser, director of LRDC,
Valerie Shute, Jamie Schultz
and Leona Schauble. .

Raghavan has a Ph.D in
applied mathematics_ from
the Indian Institute of
Technology in Madras and
an M.S. in computer science
from Pitt. Her current pro-
ject is teaching middle
school students about
hydrostatics using a com-
puter—supported environ-
ment.

seeks vo lu meets

for weight loss study  

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

The University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center is
looking for women ages 18
to 50 who are overweight
and have problems with
compulsive overeating. The
women are needed to take
part in a six—month study to
evaluate whether the drug
Fluoxetine will be effective
in helping weight loss.

Fluoxetine is more com-
monly known by its brand
name, Prozac. In 1991, The
Complete Drug Reference
stated, “There have been
recent suggestions that the
use of Fluoxetine may be
related to increased thoughts
about suicide in a very small
number of patients.”

It was also stated in the
same publication in 1990»
that, “Although not specifi-

cally included in product
labeling, Fluoxetine is used
in certain patients with
obsessive—compulsive disor-
der.”

Dr. Rena Wing, director of
the University’s behavioral
weight—control program, said
that 80 women from Pitt are
needed to take part in the
study and 50 have already
been selected. Wing said that
altogether there will be 240
people from four locations
around the country partici-
pating in the program.

“Obesity is a major health
problem in the United
States,”Wing said. “This par-
ticular weight—loss program is
an _exciting opportunity to be
involved in an [individual-
ized] program.”

the Office of Student Activities
in order to promote volun-
teerism among Pitt students
and to give them a better
understanding of the problems
facing their community, Milani

vice chancellor for Health Administration and current
president of UPMC, Jeffrey Romoff said, “Over the
past 20 years, Dr. Detre’s contribution to the health
sciences and the university has been outstanding.”

Detre has published numerous articles and chap-

ters on recurrent depression, violence and aggression

in children and other biological aspects of mental
health disorders and health policy issues.

O’Connor, a nominee for Educator of the Year, was
provost at the University of North Carolina, the
school’s highest ranking official, before coming to
Pitt. D.

He also served as vice chancellor of research and
graduate studies as well as dean of the graduate
school at UNC.

In a May 3, 1991 article in The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, C.D. Spangler ]r., president of UNC, said that
O’Connor “had an impeccable background in
research and science endeavors. Then he was able to
take his administrative ability to be a leader of facul-
tY-" .
“He was excellent at balancing research and under-
graduate academics. We hate to lose Provost
O’Connor,” Spangler said. ,

O’Connor’s other accomplishments are working in

1986 as the academic specialist in Yemen for the
United States Information Agency and serving as a
member of the 1984 Olympic Games Campus
Executive Committee.

Hazo, Pitt’s other nominee, is not only a dean but
is director of the American Experience, which hosts
special seminars for administrators. It is now in its
21st year and is based on political, social and eco-
nomic thought that has inﬂuenced the nation’s histo-
ry.

. ocated on the 36th floor in the Cathedral of
Learning, Hazo’s office is congested with books and
paper work. He said the principle item in his pro-
gram has been that quality takes preference over all
other considerations.

“I take [my work] as a less tribute to me than a trib-
ute to liberal education and the ability of the public
to discuss public issues without using academic jar-
gon,” Hazo said.

He illustrated the effectiveness of his program
through an example. He said that when people or
organizations want an evaluation of something, they
usually send self-addressed envelopes through a
mailing house asking a designated audience for a yes
or no response. A good response, Hazo said, is usu-
ally about 5 percent. A

Council

Continued from page 1

But when he sent out hundreds of letters without
self—addressed envelopes asking former participants
of American Experience to evaluate the program, 33
percent replied with formal letters favoring the pro-
gram. Only two appraisals were negative, Hazo said.

Hazo’s career as an educator and a writer has taken,

him across the United States and the rest of the
globe. Some of the highlights of his scholarly career
are serving as consultant to the American Bar
Association and as special assistant to the chairman
of the National Advisory Council on Economic
Opportunity, he said.

Before joining Pitt, Hazo was the senior editor for
political, legal, social and economic articles in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica. He also published exten-
sively in journals of opinions such as The Nation,
Christian Science Monitor and The New York Times
Boole Review. -

Other Pitt personalities were nominated in the cate-
gory of medicine science research. They include: Dr.
Ronald Herberman, director of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute; Dr. Ugene Myers, chairman of the
Department of Otolaryngology (ears, nose and throat
specialty) and Dr. Saturo Todo and Dr. Andreas
Tzakis, associate professors of surgery at Pitt Medical
School.

members to come to the council meetings, and usually one

Other projects the council is working on include a student
shuttle for basketball games and distributing campus trans-
portation maps for the new semester.

SGB Public Safety Chair Shahla Eberhardt explained the
modified transportation system that will take effect finals .
week this semester. She asked council for help in distribut-
ing maps and posters for the new system. '

“The routes are not set in stone,” Eberhardt said. “There’s
going to be problems, but we need your input on what

,_need_s_ to be worked out.” . V

Eberhardt says she feels this is a good opportunity to test
the system.

“We get to test their system, and they get to test what we
want to do,” she said. “I encourage you to use the shuttle

information systems are on
one disc, which is the
equivalent of seven print
journals,” Whitmore said.

A guide to virtually every
American dissertation
accepted at an accredited
university since 1861 can be

-found on the Dissertation

Abstracts database. These
cover all subjects and a
majority of the dissertations

_ after 1980 have abstracts.

On-line services such as
Internet, the Oakland
Library Consortium and the
OCLC enable students to
locate any journals, books
or other sources they may
need that are not found in
our library system. Then
through interlibrary loans

the books can be borrowed
whether it is somewhere in
Pittsburgh or an acknowl-
edged library system
around the United States.
But PITTCAT still pro-
vides good base work,
Whitmore said. From any
terminal you- can access the
business information cata-
log, the psychology and
related behavioral science
literature and the over five
million volumes of text
inclusive throughout the
university library system.
“Only a small percentage
of students take advantage
of the multiple resources
available,” Whitmore said.
Students in many cases
are from a high school or
town where there were

only one—ﬂoor libraries, she
said. A lot of students are
intimidated and over-
whelmed by the magnitude
of this library. ,

Amy Knapp, a librarian,
said the first question most
students ask is, “where do I
start?” _

“A lot of people see all of
the computers and do not
know how to use them and
often they get frustrated
and give up,” Knapp said.
“We want to help students
cope with their papers and
other research projects
more effectively and effi-
ciently.”

The drug Fluoxetine, or Prozac, is produced by Lilly

of Lilly Laboratories’ drug information service said that

and medical treatment of mental illness. —

“Suicide is a result of depression. Prozac doesn’t
cause suicide,” the representative said. In response to
allegations against the drug, Lilly Laboratories produced
data in late 1991 resulting in the FDA giving it a “clean
bill of health,”Lilly’s representative said.

as the Food Share Program will take longer to show
results.

“If we want to make any improvement, we've got to
include, students,” he said.

Because the program has just been implemented at Pitt,
Milani said his job is to first create awareness among stu-
dents and then to encourage them to take on the respon-
sibility for making things better for people.

When Food Share becomes strong enough, the Pitt arm
of the Rotary Club, Rotoract, will take over administration
of the program. i’

Milani will monitor the Food Share Program for a year
and perhaps involve the rest of the community. The over-
riding concern is that student participation grows in this
program, he said.

“I just think that it’s certainly the right thing to do given
the levels of needs that exist and the level of concern
about the environment and about society,” Milani said.

Societal engineering

Year after year we hear how the educational performance
of our students has slipped relative to our competitors abroad.
Not only is it just the Korean and Japanese students who out-
perform American students, but now it is several other
nations’ children who continually show greater progress than
our youths.

But the problems of our educational system transcend those
of remaining economically competitive. While economic con-

‘ cerns should remain a priority in school reforms, recent

events show that hatred and intolerance permeate our society
now more than ever. It is widely debated which policies will
be best in keeping this nation from spiraling not only toward
economic mediocrity but toward racial destruction as well.
Most people do agree, however, that drastic educational
reforms are necessary for this country to move unscathed into

. the 20th century. Unless the proper measures are taken

quickly and prudently, this goal will become but a vacant
dream. A

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has tried to establish
itself as a torchbearer on the path towards educational reha-
bilitation. The remodeled curriculum under consideration
requires that students demonstrate an “aptitude” in 10 broad
areas. Aside from the normal curriculum, these suggested
requirements are: communications, environment and ecology,
citizenship, appreciating and understanding others and per-
sonal family and community living. We don’t necessarily have
a problem with the establishment of this cuniculurn. There
are certain beneﬁts to the fact that your education will be
based actually on what you learn and not on how long you

are in school. But the problem here is how these initiatives

can be implemented without undermining the purposes of an
education. The proposals of the state could move us toward a
path similar to the one in Huxley’s Brdue New World

‘ Teaching “how to appreciate and understand” is incredibly
dangerous. The way to confront these problems is to deal
with the youth, without inculcating them. By teaching history

objectively and saying that an explorer (not discoverer) of ~

America, Christopher Columbus, pillaged, raped and stole, as

well as binded two worlds together; by teaching that during _

World War II, the country of the free, held Japanese
Americans in concentration camps; by showing that certain

C cultures eat with their hands and that,Arabs were responsible

for creating our system of numbers; educators would provide,
without setting a political agenda, the necessary steps to
understand others. .

» Hopefully all these things will provide students with-the
proper knowledge to decide for themselves what is right and

A _ what is wrong. It will allow them to see that there are people

different from themselves. And while it won’t eliminate the

‘  that currently exists, it will provide a. fairer basis on
which to make decisions. After all, that is what an education

is about — establishing the framework to make sound ratio-
nal decisions on your own, and not somebody else making
them for you. ' V .

Continuing the trials of our hero

Welcome back boys and girls.
Today our story continues as
our brave hero struggles to
overcome the two—headed
Hydra of the economy. The
Hydra is a dangerous beast, and

either of its two heads, health‘
care and economic growth,

could spell doom for our poor
hero. But he has a plan to deal
with both heads (within four
years) and save the day. Will he
be able to destroy themonster
before he is devoured? Maybe.
Clinton’s dual plans to solve
the nation’s health care and eco-
nomic problems, of necessity,
are intertwined. The failure of
one will mean certain failure for
the other. First of all, Clinton
plans to attack the Hydra head
of health care by requiring busi-
nesses, which have 50 or more
employees, to provide‘ health
care insurance or pay large
taxes in order to pay for a uni-
versal system. He also feels he
can save about $80 billion in
wasteful health-care spending

and limit the growth of cost I

increases in the future.
Unfortunately, if he manages to
slay one head with this plan,
two more (at least) will grow in
its place: unemployment and
slow economic growth.

L If Clinton implements this
plan, unemployment could sky-
rocket. Many businesses don’t
have the ability to pay for
health insurance for their
employees or to pay large taxes
to the government. They will be
forced to cut back their opera-
tions and make do with fewer
employees.

Companies that may have con-
sidered expanding will now
reconsider because of the added
cost. The nation could be faced
with negative job growth, pro-
ducing huge strains on the gov-

ernment which would be.

expected to pay unemployment
and welfare benefits to those
who could no longer find work.

This brings us to the second
new head of our economic
Hydra. Because businesses
would have to absorb more and

more costs as they expand, such
expansion could be slower. It
may not happen at all. The
result could be a recession far
worse than anything we have
experienced in recent years.
With no job growth, there can
be no economic growth. Our
economic Hydra has become
stronger.

As our hero attempts to slay
the first "head, he must also deal

P with the second — poor eco-

nomic growth. This problem is
a little different than the one
that would grow out of Clinton’s
health care plan. What I refer to
here are the original problems

Michael
Brittingham

of slow economic growth,
which we have experienced in
the past year or two.

To slay these, Clinton plans to
stimulate the economy with
increased spending on infra-
structure such as bridges and
highways. He also plans to raise
taxes on the wealthy and lower
taxes on the middle class.

These proposals, along with
his plans for "increasing expendi-
tures on education and other
social programs, may slay the
head of economic growth, but
another and far more deadly
head will grow in its place --
the deficit.

Clinton’s proposals could
send‘ the deficit through the
roof. Though he has plans for
offsetting these expenditures
with cuts elsewhere, their effect
in keeping costs down are ques-
tionable, even if he can manage
to implement all of them. This,
in turn, would simply add on
more and more to the national
debt, which is already estimated
at $4 trillion. Soon this head of
the Hydra will become so
strong _it could destroy us all.

We can talk about Sirens,
Medusa, the Hydra and the
knight in shining armor all we
want, but the point of the mat-
teris that we are in serious trou-

ble in foreign and domestic
affairs. Fairy tales and mytholo-
gy may have happy endings,
but we certainly aren’t guaran-
teed to. It’s going to take a lot
of hard work and more than a
little luck for us to pull through
more or less intact.

Perhaps, even with these
seemingly insurmountable prob-
lems, Clinton will be able to
improve the economy without
driving us further into debt. And
maybe he can develop an effec-
tive foreign policy that won’t get
us involved in a war we can’t
win. But what if he can’t? What
if things get worse regardless of
what Bill Clinton does?‘If that
happens, he’ll be heading back
to the Fairy Land of Arkansas in
four years with his tail between
his legs. In the light of this,
Clinton’s victory can be seen
not so much as the death of the
Republican Party but as a new
lease on life for the Democrats.
If things go wrong this time
there will be no evil king to
blame. Whether it’s their fault or
not, the American people will
hear no excuses this time. The
Democrats will be out.

And so this fairy tale of
American politics seems ever
more (G)rim(m) as clouds are
already beginning to appear on
the horizon. The White
Gingerbread House is not as
wonderful as it seems, and if
the knight in shining armor and
his loyal vassals can’t manage to
fight off the dark legions which
now face them, they may find
themselves to be someone’s
dinner.

Can the Frog Prince of
Arkansas save the villagers from
their horrible fate? Or will the
change he represents be seen as
nothing more than a clever illu-
sion? Only time will tell. For
now we can only sit back and
watch the story unfold and
hope there is a happy ending
just as in all good fairy tales.

Volleyball fights to prolong
dominance ofBz'g East

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

As Thanksgiving is
approaching, the Pitt volley-
ball team is getting anxious.

It is not because of the
traditional turkey, stuffing
and pumpkin pie that
awaits. It is not the Turkey
Day football games after
dinner.

It is the Big East volleyball
tournament, which is being
held this Saturday and
Sunday at FitzgeraldcField
House.

Owning this tournament
the last four years, the
Panthers hope to win it
once more. With such a vic-
tory, head coach Sue
Woodstra would claim her
third straight title, and Pitt
would be in the NCAA tour-
nament again.

“We have to play our
game,” Woodstra said of the
Panthers’ chance to success-
fully defend their title. “I
think we have to play with
confidence and play aggres-
sively.

“If we play as a group,
and that means everyone is

contributing, that is one of
the keys [in this tourna-
ment],” Woodstra said.

As they host the tourna-

ment for the second straight‘

season, the Panthers will
open against Boston College
(0-7 Big East, 11-21 overall).
Pitt (5-2, 15-13) will have a
definite advantage. The
Panthers already beat the
Eagles in three straight
games (15-12, 15-9, 15-10)
earlier this season. Pitt has
the height advantage as well
as the talent to beat Boston
College.

“It is definitely an advan-
tage lplaying BC firstl,”
Woodstra said. “I like to see
the two conference teams
we lost to in the other
bracket.”

Those two teams are
Providence (5-2, 24-10) and
Villanova (3-4, 14-15).
Providence seems to loom
as the possible heir to Pitt’s
throne while Villanova has
fallen on hard times.

“I think Providence will
come out of that bracket,”
Woodstra said of the Friars’
power. “One of the

team had more than its share of

wounds before it entered the
fray at the Ohio Open last
weekend.

Minus regulars Jeff Kloiber,
Joe Plouse and Pat Wiltanger,
an undermanned and inexperi-
enced Panther squad hit the
mats in Columbus and came
away with two placements. S

Redshirt freshman John
Richey finished fourth at the
126-pound weight class, while
senior Steve Budman placed
sixth at 150. According to
Panther head coach Rande
Stottlemyer, itwas not a bad
first outing. _

“There was a lot of good
and some not so good,”
Stottlemyer said. “... Richey was
in a pretty good weight class.

He was pretty physical on top."

That's his best position, on top,
when he’s punishing people.
By the same token he saw
some things he has to "work
on.”

Budman wrestled well but
suffered a tough loss, falling to
returning All-American Dave
Barnes of Miami (Ohio) in a
sudden—death tie—breaker. He
also lost to Michigan’s Doug
Harper twice, all in a weight
class that Stottlemyer felt was
one of the most difficult in the

tournament.

Stottlemyer said the Panthers
wrestled well early in the tour-
ney, but struggled in" the later
session. ’

“We started to hit the tougher
competition, and we didn’t
respond as well the second
time out,” he said.

However, Stottlemyer said he
was pleased with the efforts of
some younger wrestlers, citing
redshirt freshmen Greg
Budman and first-year wrestler

Brett Gould, at 142, as well as
sophomore Jeff Dyer at 190. ’

Returning NCAA—qualifier
Sean Gibbs failed to place at
177, but Stottlemyer did not
appear very concerned.

“Sean Gibbs had a couple
tough calls,” Stottlemyer said. “I
think the officiating was sus-
pect. Sean didn’t wrestle as
well as he’s capable of, but
he’ll be back.”

Kloiber, Pitt’s rock solid
junior at 190, is still recovering
from knee surgery in
September and will slowly
work himself back. Plouse sat
out due to a slight dislocation
of his right shoulder, while
Wiltanger missed the week-
end’s action due to a slight
knee injury suffered during
practice last week. The
Panthers’ next action comes
Nov. 28 at the Lock Haven
Invitational. _

“The big thing for us right
now is to get everybody in
there,” Stottlemyer said.

Hocleeyfozces-oﬁ’ with rival Duquesne

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

Perhaps nowhere else in America is ice
hockey a bigger social event and public
attractionlthan right here in Pittsburgh.
Home of the two—time defending Stanley
Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, this
town is constantly buzzing with talk of
everything and anything having to do
with hockey.

Now Pittsburghers will get a chance to
witness one of this town’s greatest rival-
ries in a battle on the frozen pond.

This Sunday, the Pitt Hockey Club
will lock horns with Duquesne in
the first of two games against the
Dukes to be played at the
Pittsburgh Civic Arena. For the
Panthers, this game is important on many
levels. I

“This is always one of the biggest
games of the year,” Hockey Club

President Mike Mahoney said. “The guys
always look forward to playing
Duquesne because of the big rivalry 
it’s the battle of Fifth Avenue.”

In addition to the obvious
Pitt—Duquesne rivalry, this Sunday’s

game will serve as a proving ground ’

for the Panthers, who are coming off
a 9-7 loss to the Steel City Stars on
Saturday.

“We definitely need to work on team
defense [inpreparation for Duquesne],”
Mahoney said. “We aren’t playing well as
a unit right now.”

If past history provides any prediction
for this game, fans can expect a hard—hit-
ting, high-intensity, penalty—filled dog-
fight.

In addition, Pitt—Duquesne games are
rarely one—sided affairs. Last year, the
Panthers and Dukes split their two meet-
ings, with Pitt winning 10-9 and

Healthy Zdyb could
fulfill potential for
women's swim team

By Jeff Kamis
For The Pitt News

If Laura Zdyb can stay
healthy for a whole season,
then the rest of the Big East
could be in trouble.

Pitt’s~sophomore swim-
mer, injury and illness
prone the last two years,
has already shown glimpses
of the potential that brought
her to Pitt early into this
year’s 1992-’93 women’s
swimming campaign.

During her senior year in
high school, Zdyb broke her
ankle in a car accident,
sidelining her for the rest of
the season. Last year, after
only two weeks of practice,
Zdyb came down with
mononucleosis and was out
indefinitely.

“It was really hard to be
sick, to not be a part of the
team,” Zdyb said. “I missed
out on a lot, with the team
and the training.”

This year’s season—open-
ing meet at Syracuse, Zdyb
took first in the 200—yard
individual medley, paving
the way for Pitt’s 131-112
rout of the Lady Orange.
She also scored points for
the Lady Panthers with
third- and fourth-place fin-
ishes in the 500 and 1,000
freestyles, respectively. But
Zdyb said that it was just
nice to be competing again
and contributing. ‘

“I’m very competitive and
I really wanted to be swim-
ming,” Zdyb said about last
season.

When Zdyb resumed prac-
ticing about this time last
year, she was far behind the
rest of the team. But even
then the amount of time she
was allowed to be in the
water was minimal.
Nonetheless, Zdyb worked
hard and was back for last

year’s Pitt Invitational in
December, her first college
meet.

“I wasn’t in top form for
the meet, or even for the
Big East Championships
[this past Februaryl,” Zdyb
said. “But I was surprised at
how I swam and that I was
able to compete.”

At the Big East
Championships, Zdyb, after
really only two months of
training, surpassed every-
one’s expectations. By fin-
ishing a respectable 10th
place in the 500 freestyle on
the first day of competition,
Zdyb had laid the ground-
work for the rest of the
meet.

“Laura dropped five sec-
onds off her time from the
morning swim and was
ready to compete the next
day,” head coach David
Belowich said.

The next morning, Zdyb
swam a 4:55.68 in the 400
individual medley prelimi-
naries to advance to the
finals. Later that day, Zdyb
broke her season-best time
in placing third in the finals
of the 400 IM.

“She [Zdyb] is a very tal-
ented girl who can really “do
some things if she’s given
the opportunity,” Belowich
said. “I was really excited
about the prospect of her
coming this year and start-
ing out, having a full year.”

Belowich said he is very
pleased with Zdyb’s perfor-
mances thus far this season,
especially under the circum-
stances.

“It’s a little different situa-
tion for her, sort of like
being a freshman all over
again,” Belowich said. “You
can’t tell somebody_how it’s
going to be, you have to let
them experience it.”

W"’’::-...........

Francis steps into holes for
explosive Penguin squad

 ’i3yiJim Clark ‘

Staff Writer

He’s a center. He takes the Penguins’
most important faceoffs. He’s relied on to
work the left point_on the power play. He
has carried a franchise, and he is the pri-
mary reason Pittsburgh won the Stanley
Cup klastiyear. And he is not Mario

Lemieux.

Ron Francis no longer has
to carry a franchise or fill
seats like he did for 10 sea-
sons in Hartford. But for a
span of five games last May,

- Francis was back to his old tricks.

Who could forget the Rangers series
last year when Lemieux was injured
in game two? Most people wrote
the Penguins off. But as he did for
10 years in'Hartford, Francis carried the
team through that round by scoring
seven goals and 12 points in six
games —— including a hat trick in game
four, with his third of the game coming in
overtime. I

When Lemieux returned for the Boston
series, Francis once again took a back
seat and let the Big Guy get the goals, the
credit and the Conn Smythe trophy. But if
not for Francis, the Penguins would have
not gotten a second Stanley Cup.

After holding out for nine games last
year and after suffering through a poor
regular season with just 21 goals and 54
points, Francis has started off quickly this
year with three goals" and 18 assists for 21
points. The assist _and point totals place
him among the league leaders. Obviously,

Francis has reason to be happy with his
start.

“Things are going pretty well,” Francis
said. “It’s going a lot better than last year.
It’s nice to get in here at the start of the
season and go through camp and get to
play a little more in better shaperather
than coming in halfway through and
being behind the eight ball. It’s worked
out a lot betterfor me.” C ' J V ‘

Two of Francis’ goals and a good num-
ber of his assists have come from working
the left point on the NHL’s number—one
power play. «

Working the point is a huge responsibil-
ity, especially for a forward. But Francis
seems comfortable and capable at running
the power play from the blue line.

“I said it before, on this club we got
so much talent that I am just happy to
get the chance to be out there,”
Francis said. “I feel comfortable playing
the point. I feel very comfortable playing
back there. It’s taken me a while to get
into it but now I feel a lot more comfort-
able.”

So with Lemieux getting the attention
he deserves for challenging Wayne
Gretzky’s scoring record, Ron Francis just
goes about the business of winning face-
offs, setting up power—play goals and fill-
ing in as the number-one center if need-
ed.

These things may not look as important
as lofty point totals, but they are. Just
remember who won the faceoff in game

one of the Stanley Cup finals to set up I

Lemieux’s game—winning power—play goal
— Francis.

Panther football coula’ have
given opponents nightmares

This summer the NBA All-
Stars put together a dream
team to represent the United
States in the Olympics.

The Pitt football team and
head coach Paul Hackett can
only dream about the team

that they should have had.

Let’s dream for a while and
put defensive end Sean Gilbert
back in a Pitt uniform —— all 6-
feet-7—in'ches and 310 pounds
of him. Gilbert was the third
pick overall

last year — a game in which
some scouts said Gilbert
played the best game that any
defensive lineman had played
in the last 10 years — Gilbert
was projected to go in either
the second— or third-round in
the draft. Gilbert was not a
high, number-one draft
prospect until he ran his 40-
yard time at Pitt Stadium.
If more loyalty was shown to
Gilbert during the year, he
probably

as a junior in
the NFL draft
last spring.
He is now
the founda-
tion that the
Rams are
building

Mike
Johns

would have
come back for
his final sea-
son because
he did take a
risk leaving
early. He was
gambling on

their defense
around.
Then at the other end of the
line put 6’7” 290—pound defen-
sive end Keith Hamilton in the
lineup. As a junior fourth-
round pick for the New York
Giants, Hamilton is seeing
some quality playing time.
Gilbert probably wanted to
stay for his senior year. In the
beginning of his junior year he
was labeled by Hackett as a
player who was not producing,
so he was put on the bench.
Since he wasn’t treated with
respect, when the NFL
knocked, he answered.

his marketabil-
ity to the NFL
despite only playing in 11
NCAA games.

Hamilton probably wanted
to leave because the team
wasn’t winning. If he stayed
another year, he would have
been taken earlier than the
fourth round of the draft.
Something could have been
done to keep Hamilton around
another year. ’

Maybe if the team was
expected to win nine games
and go to a major bowl, that
certainly would have been a
good reason to stick around.

Continued from page 11
The next member of Pitt’s

A dream team is former presea-

son All-American wide receiver
Olanda T ruitt. He is still in col-
lege football, but not at Pitt.
Truitt took his act to
Mississippi State to play for
head coach Jackie Sherill. _

Truitt should be helping Pitt
beat teams like East Carolina
and that awesome “Beast of
the East” Rutgers, instead of
losing to them.

Truitt had difficulties in the
classroom, but probably what
is more important is the fact
that he didn’t like how the

- program was being run. Why

would a player who was a
known favorite of Hackett’s —
a player who was on his way
to All-American status at Pitt —
leave?

Terrance V/'heatley was an
up-and-coming middle line-
backer who got kicked off the
team. Wheatley, now at
Auburn University, was a very
solid linebacker who had a
good chance to earn a starting

job. Wheatley was kicked off
the team because he was
accused of using charge cards
illegally. His punishment was a
matter for authorities outside
the football office to determine
and not the head football
coach.

Cornerback Barry Threats
began his Pitt career in excit-
ing fashion when he intercept-
ed Texas A&M on their final
drive in the John Hancock
Bowl in Pitt’s last bowl appear-
ance in the ‘89 season. But
that promising career ended
prematurely when he was
ruled ineligible due to acade-
mics.

Coach Hackett seems to
have a double standard when
it comes to dealing with his
players.

Wheatley did something that
was not really smart, and it
should have been handled in a
respectful manner. Alex Van
Pelt was involved in a fight at
C]. Barneys two years ago, but
he was allowed to come back
to the team with no problem

at all. Well shouldn’t Weatley
and Van Pelt have received the
same verdict?

How can you kick one man
off the team and let another
one remain? Van Pelt said you
don’t need to recruit thugs and
convicts to win football games.
Even though he was involved
in an unfortunate incident, I
wouldn’t call him a thug. But
then again, he hasn’t won that
many football games (at least" ‘
games over Penn State, Miami,
Oklahoma and Notre Dame).

To play for Pitt a high school
student/athlete must have a 2.3
in all the necessary core class-
es and a score of 750 on the
SAT. Most Division I—A schools
require their athletes to have
only a 2.0 and a 700 on the
SAT. Pitt has to decide if it
wants the best players in col-
lege football or the smartest. I
think the best players win the
most games. Not that educa-
tion is not important, but if a
student/athlete works hard in
the classroom and receives

Dream

help, he can be successful.

If not for the way Hackett
and the athletic administration
has handled the football pro-
gram, these players would be
the real team instead of a
dream. Pitt would have the
best defensive front seven in
the country and a quality cor-
nerback in Threats. On offense
it would have one of the best
wide receivers in the country.

With all that talent, Pitt could
be a top 10 team easily capa-
ble of beating Rutgers, West
Virginia, Syracuse and East
Carolina.

Hackett’s practice of holding
grudges against players has
killed Pitt in the past two
years.

In the 1990 season, Hackett
benched tight end Lionel Sykes
for arguing with his 9 position
coach Yogi Jones. Sykes went
into the season rated the third
best tight end in the country,

‘according to The Sporting News

preseason list. . .

9 Despite these credentials,
Sykes was not a featured play-
er in Hackett’s offense. What
kind of team benches a guy
who is the third best tight end
in the country with the poten-
tial to be the best? — A, team
that goes from 8-3-1 under
Mike Gottfried to 3-7-1 under
Hackett with virtually the same
players. _

- Hackett’s actions tend tokill ‘
team unity and are never for-

gotten.

If Hackett benches a player
for good or kicks him off the
team because he doesn’t like
him, how can he expect to
win? Furthermore, Hackett
doesn’t want to give his best
players a chance to _play, and
he can’t keep his best players
eligible.

Many say that Pitt has not
won this season because of
the lack of talent. But in 9’ -
the two years that Hackett
has been the head coach the
team went 3-7-1 in the ‘9O sea-
son, 6—5 in ‘91 and is headed
for a 3-9 season this year. In
that time, 10 Panther players
were drafted and are still play-
ing in the NFL. So the talent
is there. Hackett hasn’t pro-
duced any wins over top
opposition or one single
bowl appearance. In the
last two years, Pitt has put
more people in the pros
than it has won football
games.

Until Hackett changes the
way he deals with players (and
repelling histop talent) and
the administration lowers
its athletic admission stan-
dards, one factor in Pitt foot-
ball will not change — losing
records.

Following an interview
request, Coach Hackett told
The Pitt News that he had no
comment.

Swim

Continuedfrompage 10

Zdyb said it’s nice to be
a part of the team
because it has become
very close and has been
successful. ’

“There is a lot of poten-
tial with the team, and I
think we’ve already
proven that we’re going
to do really well,” Zdyb
said. “With the freshmen
coming in and swimming
well right away, they’re
helping the team out a

lot.” 9

In Sunday’s 136-106
loss to Virginia, Zdyb said
that the women were able
to swim with one of the
top-ranked teams in the
country.

“It shows the level
of talent of the team

to be able to -stick
with Virginia,” Zdyb
said about the

defeat, which the Lady
Cavaliers did not. seal
until the last individual
event.

Now that she finally has
a clean bill of health,
Zdyb’s biggest obstacle
this season may be her
own drive for perfection;

“Laura doesn’t like to

‘ get beat, even if her times "

are good,” Belowich said.
“I caution her, she needs
to ‘congratulate herself

every once in a while and
acknowledge the fact that
she’s done a pretty good
job, to keep that bal-
ance.”

Zdyb’s success did not
just stop at Syracuse. She
showed her versatility
with a first-place finish
in the 1,000 freestyle a
week later at St.
Bonaventure and then
took home two more vic-
tories, in the 200 and 500
freestyles, last Friday vs.
Virginia Tech.

Belowich said that
Zdyb’s times so far have
shown just how good she
can be.

“She’s already matched
her preliminary swim
from [last year's] Big East
in 400 IM, she’s ahead of
her 1,000 pace at Big
East,” Belowich said.
“That’s exciting.”

Zdyb said that regaining
the Big East title is on the
girls’ minds, but it is only
one of their goals.

“We want it back, but

right now we just want to

have fun and do our
best,” Zdyb said.

Duquesne 8-7.

This year, the 2-4 Panthers
will be entering the Igloo
without one of their top
players. Rookie forward
Scott Kalson — Pitt’s second
leading scorer with six
goals and four assists in
five games — injured his
shoulder in the 7-0 Panther
victory against Allegheny
College on Nov. 8. He will
be out for the rest of the
season.

With Kalson gone, the
Panthers will now rely even
more on centerman Bill
Crousey for a strong offen-
sive punch.

Crousey has easily
been the most exciting
player in any of Pitt’s

games this season. He
leads the Panthers with
an incredible 25 points
(13 goals, 12 assists) in
six games. He has
scored at least two points
in every game this season.
His best performances
this year include. a
four—goal, eight—p'oint
outburst in a 14-3 drubbing
of"Pitt—Johnstown, as well
as a five—goal, seven-point
performance against the
Stars. _ . '
/Fittingly, ‘ the - Mario
Lemieux of the Panthers has
figured in on 66 percent of
his team’s goals. *

Volleyball

Continued from page 13
opening match could be
Georgetown vs. Syracuse. The
Hoyas (4-3, 13-14) and Orange (4-3,
14-18) are the most even match of
the first round.

Playing the winner of
Georgetown—Syracuse, Pitt will face
a team it swept during the regular
season. Pitt won matches handily in
three games at Syracuse on Oct. 17
and at Georgetown on Nov. 7.

Pitt’s biggest edge is that neither
Georgetown nor Syracuse has an
explosive player like Panther out-
side hitter Ann Marie Lucanie.

Lucanie, who is going for an
unprecedented third straight Big
East tournament MVP, should take
the Panthers to the ‘finals and will
again be the number—one contender
for the tournament’s finest player.

“IfVshe plays the way she played
the entire year, she has a shot [at
MVP],” Woodstra said. «

If everything falls into place a-nd-
this scenario happens, it will be the"
No. 1 seeded Panthers pitted against

the No. 2 Friars. This should be a
great final, but Pitt’s home—court
advantage might pull the Panthers
through even though they lost to
Providence at Fitzgerald Field House
earlier this season.

“We feel comfortable here [at
Fitzgerald Field House],” Woodstra
said. “It is less stressful not having
to travel, and we are anxious to win
at home.”

With the home—court advantage
and a - much improved team,
Woodstra said that her Panthers are
in position to win. Pitt started the
Big East season with a 1-2 record
and won four straight to pull out the
top seed in the conference.

“They [the players] have worked
really hard this season,” Woodstra
said. “The girls just have to play like
they want it.”

Match Times: Opening matches

will begin at 9 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.,
and the semi-final matches are set
for 5:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. on
Saturday. The finals will be held on
Sunday at 2 p.m. I
