With its activities almost completed
the University housing bureau for
men has placed 150 out-of-town fresh-
men in approved homes and is ﬁnd-
ing-residences for 20 more. The above
ﬂgure*7includes 12 students who are
living with relatives, but does not
contain. the number of upperclassmen
who have been housed by the bureau.
Theodore W. Biddle is the director.

One. of the University's most strin-
gent rules upon visiting freshman stu-
dents is that they reside in a house
which conforms to certain standards
setby the school. This is, to protect
their ,i_.nt.erest»s- by providing an ade-
quate‘ living and, study environment.

must consent to take ‘proper care of

Men who desire to live at a fraternity
house, after the rushing period, must
give 30 days" notice of intention to
move to both their present landlord
and Mr. Biddle. This regulation will
be stringently enforced.

Close Silence Period
Thursday at-.5

‘Men Go to Housels

A total of 542 bids were extended
freshmen by the nineteen fraternities
on the campus at the. endof the nine-
day rushing period which was brought
to a close Sunday morning.

In one of the most hectic periods in
recent years, since the limit on the
fraternities, affairs were lifted by the
de-an of men’s oﬂice, freshmen were
kept in a continual swirl of activity
over the period which included smok-
ers, dinners. house dances. and infor-
mal meetings of fraternities groups
with prospective pledges.

‘Considering’ the decline in the num-
ber'ot' fraternities. this Year, and the

4 decrease of freshman-enrollment, the '

fraternities extended a. record nu1n-
1391' -of bids during the rushing period.
Fraternities last year extended 524
bids to 358 freshmen, which compares
this year to 542 bids extended to a
total 329 freshmen, extending eighteen
bids more than 1ast'year to ﬁve less
-students than thenumber last year.

One hundred‘ ninety-ﬁve freshmen
were extended single bids by frater-
nities. Eightyitwo received bids from
two of the houses on the campus;
forty—three were given three invita-
tions to become a fraternity mem-
ber; nine students received a total
of ,,four invitations. and one student
received ﬁve bids from houses on the
campus. ’ -

Announcement of the prospective
pledges choices to houses will be
made Thursday at 5:00 o’clock, when
silence period for this season will be
oﬂicially brought to a close. Upon
the announcement of their house se-
lection, the freshmen will go directly
to the house to which he has selected
as his choice.

It is expected that this year’s pledg-
ing will be. higher than that of last
year when 163 freshmen ‘wereipledged
at the ‘close of rushing period.

__ Founders’ Day Banquet

Fall tapping of new members into
Omicron Delta Kappa, national hon-

place Monday, November 21, twelve‘
days before the fraternity Founders’
Day celebration on December 3, it was
decided at a luncheon meeting -held
Friday in the Ruskin Apartments.

Plans for a unique tapping of a
more public nature that would elimi-
nate the customary smoker, also were
discussed during Friday's meeting.
President Charles G; Hugus, Jr., Col.
’33, refused to disclose the nature of
the new tapping exercises. but" indi-
cated the program would be a com-
plete departure from that formerly
held at the University.

Luncheon-business meetings of the
fraternity will be held twice each
montli for the remainder of the year,
Hugus -said, and probably will be held
in a private room adjacent to the Uni-
versity Cafeteria. ‘

A special election of Chi, Rho Nu,
honorary pre-medical fraternity, took
place last Thursday evening in room
3," State Hall. The election was call-
ed to ﬁll offices left vacant by the
admission to Medical School of C. E.
McKee, G. L. .Gleeson, and E. L.
Heller. The following were the re-
sults of the election: vice president,
Walter Klein; secretary, Angelo A.
Petraglia; David Patrick, treasurer,

William_C. Edwards,‘ last year's
president and‘ now a medi,{-zag, student,
gave a brief review of the club’s ac-
tivities la.st year. .He also discussed
the invitation given the club by
Alpha Epsilon Delta, national pre-
medical honorary, to become one of
the chapters in its organization.
After a brief discussion. it was de-

‘ cided that Chi Rho Nu would remain

a local honorary fraternity.

Members discussed the question of
raising’ the scholarship requirement
for membership. to a point average of
2, or “B” average. The present
scholarship requirement is 1.75 aver-
age. The matter was tabled until
the next meeting, but so much of the
[discussion was favorable to the _ra1s-
ing of the average, that it is highly
probable’ that the higher rating W111
soon be required. ~

each freshman was asked to‘ give her

forced by the committee. With but
one exception, every woman said she
was in favor of some regulations for
freshmen. . ,

In a study made of these tests by
the committee, it was found that 142
freshman women favored compulsory
freshmen regulations for the reason
that they were a great help in making
friends, both with other freshman
women and with upper class women.
If itwere not for freshman regulations

-:- PITT

  BITS '3'

Add another chapter to the story
of the newly-formed Pitt passing
combinations, that of Heller to Sk1ad-
any. Few, if any Pitt followers, ever
expected Muggsy to become the re-
ceiving end of many passes this year
or any other Yea1‘- "

The only trouble for other

Pitt opponents is that a gentle-

man by the name of Dailey can

also catch passes.

It does seem a shame that the
game Was” transferred from the
Yankee Stadium to Mitchie Field.

At least seventy or eighty thousand
fans could have ‘been accommodated
at the former, while the latter holds
less than 26,000 at $4.40 per.
Something must have gone
wrong with Weins’cock’s_A point-
after-touchdown kicking as the
big Wilkes-Barre’ lad never be-
fore missed three straight. How-
ever, nothing was wrong with his -
kicks on the kick—offs, with Izzy
sending two in succession over
the Army goal line.‘ If Army
hadn't taken the ba_ll on their
own twenty, he might still be
kicking.
From the radio and newspaper ac-
counts. of the game, it seems that
for the major

part of--the game, but the score

; doesn’t reveal it.

In case some of you really
wondered ‘where the sound af-_
fects that were used in the broad-

i' cast came from, you’re about to

be let in on a secret. They were

takenfrom “Skippy,” (not an ad-'
‘ vertisement.)

The headline in the NEWS‘ that
made ’ the
trip to West Point counted the chess

‘team in with the cross-country and

the football team._
Pitt footballers go into high
societytonight when Jock Suth-
erland introduces them at Syria
Mosque. From all indications,
‘ .the'whoIe mob will muscle in on

a free feed Heaven help the
V treasury.
- "Pitt was penalized ﬁve yards in
‘tile ‘ﬁrst quarter for intentionally
grounding a pass. As far as I can
remember, which isn’t‘ very far, this
penalty has never been given a Pitt
team-

Even if Army did make‘ the
first down, Pitt took the ﬁrst .-
time—out,,, and made the ﬁrst

Army countered by

in the first substitute,
and made the first fumble.

. In addition to grabbing two beau-

tiful passes, as passes go, Muggsy

_ ‘Skladany broke up the Army scoring
threat in the ﬁrst "quarter by throw-
_,ing Fields for a ﬁfteen yard

lo-ss.
The tackle was so bardg’ that the an-
station
telegraph wire.

‘Incidentally, some interesting
facts were acquired by listening
V over the radio. .'For instance,
Pitt ; was playing the United
«States Army, andthe announcer
-,.i.co].|l_cl-tell how near the goal lines ‘
the teams were "from our seat -up
hé1_‘e.” He did a good job though.
Before the game went on the air.

 Jock Sutherland was quoted as say-
, ing.he’d ‘like to feed the newspaper

men who gave the Panthers the pre-
game nod to .win a banquet starting

 off with acid and ending up with a
-ground glass salad. Why, Doctor. give

the ground glass ﬁrst, and you won't

: . need the rest.

Pitt wil| need considerable pol-
ishing up if they expect to take
the rest of their‘ games. Panther
opponents, as a-whole did pretty

well on Saturday. Notre Dame
defeated Drake; Ohio State lost
to wMichigan; Penn defeated

 Dartmouth: Carnegie tied Wash-
‘Jeff; Nebraska lost to Minneso-
ta; Stanford defeated the West .
_ Coast Army.
More substitutions were used by
Pitt on Saturday than in any other

. close, important game in a long time

Pitt used ﬁfteen subs wl1ile.Army
was using twelve. _

The ﬁnal score seems surpris-
ing-when you consider that Pitt,

only had eleven ﬁrst downs to

Panther followers who had their
money down without giving away
any points can thank Rocker for in-
creasing their bankroll. His two
tackles that threw Fields for two
ﬁfteen yard losses at the very end
of the game saved the day for Pitt.

Heller's performance will like-
Iy give him one -of the ten “All-
American caliber” ratings given
each week. The program, given
every Friday night, is recommend-
ed to all.

Downtown Director
Says Ease Needed
By Engineers

_ Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, direc-
tor of the Downtown Division of
the University, addressed the
regular weekly seminar of the
American Society of Mechanical
and Aeronautical Engineers, last
Thursday in Thaw Hall.‘ The
topic discussed was “Human En-
gineeringl’

Dr. Lanfear stated, “An engi-
neer 'can be the best trouble-
shooter in the business and never
reach the top. Two men may pos-
sess the same college education

; and an equal amount of technical
knowledge; yet one can become
president of thecompany while

- the other goes on for years in the
same rut. A rounded education,
besides specialized information,
is vital.” -
_ As necessary qualiﬁcations for
a successful career, Dr. Lanfear
listed the following: ease in so-
ciety; knowledge of the other
man’s personal interests a.nd
‘ability to talk intelligently of
them; neat and invariably clean-
cut appearance; a pleasant and ,
likeable personality, and a knowl-
edge of the composition of that
abstract thing, personality. In
speaking of appearance, Dr. Lan-
fear stated that expensive clothes

.. are not required, but an intelli-
gent care of the clothes one does
possess is essential.

Nicholas Ha.s, director of the Utica
Art Student's League, who is a fel-
low of the Royal Photographers’ So-
is also a painter,
author, -"teacher and illustrator, was
the "speaker at the -Research Bureau
of Retail Training on Wednesday.

His talk consisted of a discussion of
formal and informal proportion. in
art, the emotions portrayed, ways to
achieve emphasis, and the importance
of understanding lines and the place-
ment o‘t‘- lines for the proper interpre-
tation of painting. Modern art which
may appear to many people as a riot
of color and unguided lines has, ac-
cording to Nicholas Has, a signiﬁ-
cance to people who have a more in-
telligent understanding of what it's
all about. ’

Tech Plebes

MaIarI<ey and Vaughn Score as
Cubs Win Stadium Tilt

Led by Captain Malarkey, and
demonstrating unexpected power, the
Pitt freshman footballers made Sat-
urday a banner day for the Panthers
by trouncing the Tech Plebes at the
Stadium, 12-0.

The victory over the Plebes marked
the second successive victory for
“Skip" Gougler’s charges.

The little Panthers scored ﬁrst near
the end of the ﬁrst quarter when‘,
after -recovering a Tech fumble,
Malarkey took the ball over. The
second touchdown, which came in the
last minute of play, resulted from the
interception of "_a Tech pass by
Vaughn, who raced eighteen yards
for the touchdown.

Tech’s closest scoring threat ca.me
in the third quarter when they had
the ball on the Pitt seven-yard line.

_ Army Defeats Panther

, Harriers in Close Race

Pitt’s cross-country team’s bid for
an undefeated season was smashed
last Friday when Coach Olsen’s har-
riers dropped a close race to West
Point, 25 to 30.

The score was closer than had been
predicted, as Army is noted- for its
cross country teams, and had ,.the ad-
vantage of running on their home
course. Wagenliouser again led the

When Tracked to Their.Den, Panthers Meekly Answer

 

’. Quiz; Reveal Dual Life,-"Hearts of Blue and Gold
I By Israel Goldberg

The Pitt Panther is an exciting animal.

As we looked -about,

we were quite sure that he held something of interest for Pittites.
Beneath that tawny skin, we. felt certain there lurked a heart of

gold. Maybe even blue and gold.

So we investigated.

We soothed our preliminary misgivings by hunting out the beast
in his lair. Strange to say, he is far from ferocious when off duty,
but perhaps we found him as he gloating-ly prepared to devour a

certain Army mule.

He stalks about¢ .

quite unceremoniously, with little to
betoken his double life.

The Pitt Panther, you know, leads
a. dual _existence. In fact, “they”
lead double lives, for, would you be-
lieve it, the Panther “are” two
Panthers. It “are” Earl Shipley and
Craig Stewart, both Dent. ’33.

When, for..our beneﬁt, his cloak
was dropped, our fear of wild ani-
mals was abated somewhat. To
amend the proverb, you can't change
a panther’s skin~—well, not in half a
minute, anyhow! So we approached

the men who do the zoo act on [Satur-

days and asked
question.

“Isit true that you Panthers work
like horses on game days? We- hear
that uniform of your weighs ﬁfteen
pounds.” The reply came back in a
s'ort‘of stifled grunt. “Say, you can't
saddle a thing like that on us. We‘
don’t do horses’ work. All we per-
form out there is a little horseplay.”

At last we gained enough courage
and somewhat tamely asked, “Why
are there two of you?” Apparently
that was easy. “You see, b-ack in
Pantherica, we had a. little popularity
contest. Everyone went to the polls,
where he was allowed to cast his
ballot. Both of us won by the dint
of our teeth, and, ever since, we’ve
been clawed-hoppers at the Stadium.”

As we left the Pitt in which these
fellows live, we found explained the
Panther’s wild capers on the sod. He
eats, as he sleeps, and careens.
Hoover heard of anything like it?

 Highly’ favored before the
the Panthers found themselves face
to face with an eleven that managed
to score twice on its own and hold
the ﬁnal result to an 18-13 victory.
Brilliant playing by Fields, the
Army halfback, combined with the

strength of the ﬁghting Cadet 1ine,i
gave the West Pointers the lead a}

few moments in the third quarter. A
long pass from I-Ieller to S-kladany, a.
hard plunge off-tackle by Sebastian,
and a ﬁnal push-over by Fullback

Weinstock netted the Pitt boys the-

necessary «six points to break the
Army lead and take the game in that
third period. ‘

An estimated crowd of 20,000 per-
sons were on two sides. of Michie .Sta-.

s * Education and the Times

 ’ I NIERICAN college and university students are taking_ this mat-

ter of getting an education more seriously today than ever be-

fore. In support of this dogmatic statement of a change in student

I ‘attitude are the facts revealed in a survey of student personnel and
enrollments furnished the New York -Times by seventy—se_ven col-

if leges and private schools at the beginning of the current semester.

L Percentages of loss in student enrollmentsfrom twenty-two co-
educational institutions included in the survey are both illuminating
-and encouraging. 'VVhile losses of 25 per cent or more were antici-
pated by many of the larger universities," the greatest_ loss experi-
enced in any single instance was that of 13.6 per cent reported by
'-the Universityiof Cincinnati. Of the four co—educational institiitions_
reporting gains in, registration, Westminster and “Allegheny, both
-Pennsylvania colleges, showed respective gains of 15.2 per cent and
1.7. per cent. '
Pitt held up well in the rating of the eighteen remaining _col-
leges who reported losses of from one to 13 per cent, being sixth
‘with a loss of 6.3 per cent at the time of the survey. Penn State,

.;the only other Pennsylvania ‘co-educational college reporting, was

-second with a loss of only 3.4 per cent. .
P  iniour own "institution, the introduction _of advanced en-
‘trance requirements .for freshmen in many of those colleges refer-
red to in the survey has had something to do with both the enroll-
-ment.losses and the marked improvement noted in the student ma-
terial. Both the University of Chicago and Harvard University .en-
rollments show a higher averagein individual ‘records than they
did last year. . »
I, Unnecessary luxuries long since have beeen erased from the un-
dergraduate’s budget. ~ Secondhand text books and “cooperative
eatingj” seem to be. in tune with the times. : Harvard this year
created 279 new part-time positions, carrying totalemoluments of
$40,000, all of which are. expected to be of “practical beneﬁt” to
both the students and the university. The Times also reports that
at Purdue University 90 per cent of the studentsare working. to pay
their way through college. ' '

. o 77 I
Education, in short, seems to_ have “come down to earth. One

statement from The Times best sums up the situation as revealed by,
{the survey:

“One, of the most striking thingsindeed about the whole survey
is the intense faith which it reveals on the part of the Amei_'ican,peo-
‘ple in highereducation and the determination to have it at any
sacrifice.” ' ’ - ' ‘ ’

Physics ll Students
Tote Galley Proofs
25 Inches Long .

The newest thing with which
some Pitt students have to con- I
tend this year is two feet of text.-
book. The -book, “Atomic
Physics,” is not going to be pub-’
lished in bound form until Janu-
ary; so all students of Physics II
are forced to do their studying
from the galley proofs which are
about twenty-ﬁve inches long and
seven inches wide. U

The galleys were sold to the
class for $1.50, this money to be
subtracted from the original cost‘
of the book when it is -published.

Dr. Blackwood has been teach-
’ing atomic physics for two years
without a text, and he claims he
would rather see his students
tangled up in two feet of galley
proof than see ‘them with "no book

-cesses and beneﬁts that have accrued
during its reign. If these successes
and beneﬁts disappear over a long pe-
riod of time, the government of neces-
slty would have to be fundamentally
changed.” _

“Present problems are vastly’dif-
ferent from those ‘of a century ago,"
he continued. “At that time they

men, but now the difficult problems.

 

less to carry out what they know to
be the solution. Is representative
government a passing phenomena?”

Inconclusion, Dr; Graper stated:
“Individualism is dead, for nine out
of- every ten workers in this country
are in nearly absolute servitude
There is no hope for them in the two
ruling classes, for these do not deal
with the fundamentals; and it is
only through fundamentals that the
masses can be helped. It is possible
that we» may see a. gradual abdication
of the ruling minority, but,” he
warned, “history has no record of
such an action!”~ ’

Four outside authorities will speak
at future meetings of the seminar.
The two already contracted for are
Dr. F. Cohen, who will speak on phil-
osophy, and Dr.'Elwood, who will
speak on sociology. . -

Meinorial Hall Attendants Scrub‘Soldier and Sailor bu
Peace Hasn’t Had af Bath for 21 Years , ’

Thousands ofcoeds walk up Bige-
low Boulevard every day on- their
way to classes. Of these thousands
every one takes a bath a day (or at
least one a week) yet every day they
pass a lady who, in the 21 years of
her life, hasnever had a bath.‘ ,

Peace, as she is known to a chosen
few, sits up over the doorway of
Memorial Hall day after day, watch-
ing freshly washed coeds, their noses
nicely powdered, streaming out of
street cars .and up the hill to Alumni
Hall. Nobody ever notices ~ her,
though students constantly pass be-
neath her on their way to assemblies
and orientation classes. Even the

I guards pay no attention. - When one

fresh young man asked one of the
guards what the lady’s name was, the
guard admitted that he had never even
noticed her, perched up there above
the door. _

Peace is particularly indignant be-
cause her pals, thesoldier and the

sailor at either side of the entrance,

 

_get a bath every four or ﬁve months,

and she feels slighted._ “It is very
disappointing,” she says, “to wait 21
years, especially when you are just
dying to try a new beauty treatment.
The boys look simply beautiful after

they have been scrubbed with .oil;. it .

brings: out ‘the full color of their
bronze complexions.” .
According to attendants at the

Memorial‘Hall the .reason_ the poor‘

lady has. been neglected’ so long is
that the only w.ay of getting up to
clean her is to ~ build a scaffolding
around her and then go through the
cleaning process several times to re-
move the dirt which has been accum-
ulating for so many years. ’ '
“This is carrying things too far,”
is Peace’s-retort. However “if they

don’t do something about me pretty‘

soon I'm going to disgrace my name
and uiisheath the sword which I have
spent all these years trying to sheath
and then I'm going to get down off
my -high horse and hunt a bath tub.”

Blind Pitt Student
, Pilotecl Through
if , Life By Dog

By Sam Honigberg.

Blind since the age of three, Paul
W.‘ Douglas, a sophomore in the col-'
lege, has successfully graduated from
the School for the’Blind and succeeded
in attaining a “B” standing in his
freshman year.. ' _

“Nighvt-," a coal black German shep-
herd dog, serves as Pau1’s eyes.
Specially trained, she adheres to
Paul's signals. During class hours
she sleeps, but as soon as the bell
rings she wakes -up and stands ready
for Pau1’s instructions. When they
reach the steps‘ she sits .down, this
being a signal to ‘Mr. Douglas.

Paul has a special permit to ride
with the dog on street cars. When
given reading assignments -he either
employs readers or uses the Braille
system of reading when he can ob-
tain books of that sort. In class he
takes notes with the .aid of a slate
and stylus. At home he prepares his
work on a typewriter, which he man-
ipulates perfectly. I

Handicapped as he may be, Mr.
Douglas is perfectly satisﬁed.‘:'H_e has
but one ambition and it is one’-which
he can never attain: He actually
wants to see all the modern inven-
tions, the developments of which he

Players Cast.

First Vehicle

Organize, Reserve ‘
Following Tryouts

-' After an entire’ week of preliminary
tryouts, Carl B. Cass, director of Pitt
Players, is preparing a cast for the-
;group’s ﬁrstmajor production of the
year, “Enter Madame.” '_

The tryouts have resulted in the
formation of a group of reserves, who
are eligible for service, ‘but cannot
vote or hold office in the organization.
Reserves can become active members
by completing acreditable service in
the Players. Women are not ‘eligible
for membership until their sophomore
year. ' I .

'At this time of the year the active
membership is at its lowest point due
to graduation and the fact that there
has not yet been an opportunity for

service by which the new reserves
may become actives. At present there
are seventy-ﬁve men on the active
list. Fifty in acting; eighteen in
technical. work (building, painting,
lighting, etc.), and seven in business.
There are seventy-one women on the
active list. Sixty-eight prefer acting;
one preferstechnical work, and two
prefer business. ..

Eighteen‘ men and ﬁfteenwomen of
last year’s group have graduated.
Fifty-two men and forty-ﬁve women
of the groupare out of school or have
not otherwise been accounted for.

Approximately sixty people tried out
for the acting unit of the players dur-
ing the -past week. "There are about
twenty--ﬁve others yet to try out.

In outlining his plans for the coni-
ing season, M1‘. "Cass has tentatively
chosen three well known and success-
ful plays for his major productions.
The ﬁrst, “Enter Madame,” is the

story of a temperamental opera star.

It was written by Gilda Varesi and
Dolly Byrne and will be produced here
on November 17. The mid-winter
show will probably be Stephen Phil-
lips" tragedy in verse, “Paola and
Francesca.” The brilliant Broadway
success. "'*Craig’s Wife,” will be the
spring production.

duration in the office, working.
Wallie and Ollie, in the stadium

ticket office, handle tickets the whole
year round. Day in, day out, they
count tickets, sort tickets, and fill or-
ders. Thousands of tickets for each
game go through their hands, thou-
sandsiof numbers on football and
basketball tickets pass before their
eyes. .

Early in April these two ticket sell-
ers start preparing for the football
season. There are thirty thousand
envelopes to be addressed and ﬁlled
with order blanks and information
folders and thirty thousand one-and-
a-half cent stamps to be licked. Then,
as soon as the tickets are printed in
August, they all have to be counted
and sorted before being put into the
racks.

In spite of the monotony of their

work, Wallie and Ollie manage to

keep in a pretty good humor -and
have lots of stories to tell. _
,People are constantly asking them

dumb questions, and trying to‘ put it-

over on them at ticket exchanges.
“Speaking of people who try to chisel
their way in,” said Ollie, “there'are
hundreds of them chased away every
year, particularly from the big games.
They impersonate everybody from
football players to private detectives.
We have ‘city officials,’ ‘building
officials,’ and people who ‘have to
see somebody’ at every gate.” .
“At one game during the 1927 sea-
son, Gibby Welcli’s last year at‘Pitt,”
he -‘recalls, “there were four Gibby
Welches appeared at the gate insist-

‘ing that they had to get in-, when we

knew that Gibby was in this dressing
room.”  .

 

AN INCUBATOR
IS SOMETHING YOU
BURN RUBBISH IN

SK! TSK! Isn’t it too bad! Bill
Boner thinks a blizzard is some-
thing you ﬁnd inside a fowl!

Why doesn’t somebody give him a
good pipe and some tobacco? For a
pipe helps a man to think straight. Of
course, it’s got to be the right tobacco.
But any college man can guide him
in that. A recent investigation showed
Edgeworih to be the favorite smoking
tobacco ate./,2 out‘ of 5!, leading colleges.

Which is only natural-—for in all
tobaccodom there’s no blend like the

mixture of ﬁne old burleys found in ,

Edgeworth. In that diﬁerence there’s
a new smoking satisfaction, a new"

comfort, for the man who likes to _
