OIL EXPLO

Students were attracted from ttheiri

broke out among the yardequipment
of the Mellon Institute. At 1310 P.

caused by a defective gasket which

treme pressure.

The apparatus ‘was intended for the
testing of fuel used in the prepara-
tion of resin for thevmanufacture of
auto tires. The employees. of the
plant were saved from. injury ‘by the
fact that they were at some distance

ﬁrst-class. Well, as usual, I got the
baggage weighed and the, flrst—class
ticket vised and the trunks on the train.
Then I got the women through the gate
and they started for the train which
was across on another rail. Then I
looked up and-saw that it was getting
late. The ticket for the two-cooks
wasn’t .vised yet. The place where
their ticket was to be vised is clear
across the ‘square in front of the sta-
tion in another building. That is be-
cause it is a different class ticket.
A Ticket Mix-Up.

I wanted to watch the nurses;.there
was a Frenchie there who spoke Eng-'
lish and he volunteed to show the cooks
where to get their ticket vised. He
started -with them after I had handed
them their ticket. ‘They had no sooner
disappeared than I saw that by a pure
blunder I had given them the nurses’
ticket. It was two minutes to train
time. The women were out on'the train
alone. I -started after-the menrbut I
couldn’t ﬁnd them. I.ran around for
a minute like a_stuck pig. I couldn’t
find the suckers any. place. The train
was starting; ~I ,had to think fast.
There are all kinds of rules-in the army
and one is that you can't leave your
post without an order. If you do you
are absent. without leave and ready for
a court martial. There I was and there
were the nurses on thetrain. Not one
of them knew -where they were going”
not one of -them could talk French and
they had no tickets. They were up
against it right. It didn’t take. long for
me to decide. I streaked across the
tracks and hopped the train just as it
was pullillg‘ out.

I knew 'one thing, and that was that
I wa-sn’t going to let those nurses get
lost. Lord knows where the cooks were.
I di _’._t., The nurses were the most sur-

' ‘ ” ortals in the world. They 'knew_

~. ‘e'»wasn’t supposed to travel with
‘and I hadn't any orders to go.
But according to the wire we had at the
hospital these nurses were to go to a
certain place where some Americans
would meet them; ‘so I determined that
ordersor no orders, I’d get them to the-
place where they.wou1d nieetthe Amer-
icans. The funniest part of it all was
that they thought they were going to
go east to the front, whereas, I knew
they were going west towards the At-
lantic Ocean. Well, we traveled along
laughing and joking making the best ‘of
it. They couldn’t quite ﬁgure how we
were going tmmake it. .All I had was
a second-class ticket good for two ‘men
without baggage. And I had fourteen
nurses and. myself in a ﬁrst-class com-
partment with 500 pounds of baggage
on the rear end. ‘

The commissionaire -Helps.

I had a fair idea of what I would
do. Inevery French city there is a

station. It’s their job to take ‘care of

would get one at the next big town
where we were to change trains. So.

when we arrived there I got the bag- ‘

gage off and got in touch with the Com-
missionaire. He was an old duck with
long whiskers and though I could ‘par-_
ley enough to get away with it, I was
lucky in that there was a young inter-
preter there who spoke_ English pel-
fectly. We explained to the old man
that we had the cooks’ tickets and that

they had ours, and that they would be '

along with it. so that the Government

wou1dn’t‘get cheated on the fai"es.7 A-t -

I. said. The

‘cooks might g_et=pie—eyed and never" get- .

_ en had tobe at a._.
certain town; at he bells. that night.
S_o we argued awhile ‘and-‘then ‘he
wrote a little piece of paper (whi'_ch I
still have by the way). And this piece-
of paper told whoever it might concern,
that these nurses were to go" to this cer-

.tain town and‘ that transportation for

them should be furnished. That's the
way they do things in France.
me, he said I could pay my fare if I
wanted to goalong. .‘Well, that wasn't
much: as soldiers ride here for one-
fourth fare. But I didn’t intend to pay
that. For. when he wrote his note he
unconsciously put .in “Take these
women and their guide.” That was I.

“So we all piled into a first-class com-

partment or rather several of them. Be-
fore the train started I tried to get the
hospital on the long distance phone to
tell them where I was, and to tell them
how to get the cooks away. But though
I got- the hospital, I didn't get the man
I wanted. .'.While they were hunting
him, the train started so I beat it with-
out ﬁnishing the call.

, was no A spy

We had a fine time after that. The
nurses had several boxes full of eats
and we had a regular dinner. ' We had
lots of fun wondering what happened
to the cooks. Then there was a funny
looking‘French,officer who wore a long
beard (he loo_ked rather Russian), and
he insisted on standing right at our
compartment doors and listening to the
conversation.‘ So I had to put the Q.
T. on any talk about military matters;
Then I thought Pd have some fun with
him. So I kept Walking back and forth‘
from one‘ compartment to the other,
bumping into him and standing on his
toes at every opportunity. Whether he
was a spy or just a plain impolite nin-
compoop, I don't know. However, after
a. while he got tired of having me
‘shove him around,’ so he went into his
compartment like a good.boy. and shut
the door." Just to show him that I
wasn't mad, after a while I went in
afterhim and talked French to him for
about half an hour. He said he was a
Lieutenant in the French Medical Corps
and was doing some -special work on
tuberculosis of the bones. I thought he
was lying ‘all the time, but ‘finally I
gave him the beneﬁt of the doubt.

It had grown dark and we were still
on our way. To pass the time away I
got _into conversation with a French
Major‘ and -we talked about thewar for

a conversation in French, is as good to
them as an American officer, and eveii
more so,_for ther.e are very few Amer-

‘number is surprisingly low. .
Fina11y‘we ‘came to our destination
and there we found the Americans
waiting for us. We found that the
camp. was about thirty miles from the
station, so after the baggage was loaded.
