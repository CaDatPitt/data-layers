Wren Suggests Parking Lot
On Frick Acres, Ruskin
Field As Possible

NO DIPLOMA CHANGE

 

High School Day Committee
Asked For Statement

 

For the ﬁrst time since agitation
began several years ago for improved
parking conditions on campus, the
Parking and Traﬂic Committee of the
Student-Faculty Association made
some deﬁnite suggestions.

John Wren, E38, chairman of the]

committee, speaking before the Ex-
ecutive Committee at their meeting
last Tuesday, reported that -his com-
mittee felt that the space between
the Cathedral and the new Heinz
Chapel would make a possible park-
ing place.

This section of the Cathedral plot
could not be used immediately, for
the ground is a quagmire due to re-
cent rains. The ground would have
to be cleared off and drained to be
ﬁt for parking. However, it was
pointed out that this would be done
anyway, upon completion of the Work
being done at the Heinz Chapel.

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men, proposed that a
section of Ruskin Field be used.

Diploma Change" Unlikely

It was further suggested that im-
provement in traﬁic and pedestrian
regulation is badly needed on Uni-
versity Drive between Parkman Ave-
nue and Alumni Hall. Recommenda-
tions will be forwarded to the Pitts-
burgh Better Traﬂic Commission, it
was decided.

After hearing the report of Leonard
Seder, BA37, chairman of the Diplo-
ma Committee, the Executive Com-
mittee decided that opinion in regard
to the change to smaller diplomas is
too much divided for a change, es-

Endowment

Bevier Adds $15,000 To Fund
For School Of Mines;
Oil, Gas Beneﬁt

 

George M. Bevier, internati-onally-
known oil geologist of Houston,
Texas, and a graduate of the Univer-
sity in 1913, has added $15,000 to
his initial gift of $10,000 to the
School of Mines, E. A. Holbrook, dean
of the School of Mines, announced
yesterday.

According to the provision-s of his
contribution, the gift and any addi-
-tional property given are to be known
as the George M. Bevier Fund, to be
investedlby the University. The in-
itial gift of $10,000, made las-t Feb-
ruary, was designated as the start of
the fund f-or the beneﬁt of the School
of Mines, and particularly for the
oil and gas departmen-ts. Mr. Bevier
expects to keep giving until the fund
amounts to $100,000.

Born in Brookville, Pennsylvania,
Mr. Bevier attended the Brookville
high school and was graduated from
the University School of Mines in
1913. He served as assistant state
geologist in Pennsylvania from 1913
to 1915, was a consulting geologist
fo-r a year, and accompanied a geo-
logic-al expedition to Central America
in 1916. He served in the oil and
lubrication branch of the United
States Army department of military
aeron-autics in 1918, and was district
geologist for oil companies from 1920

“Starting lineups here, only

State grid team up in the Stadium in
what appears to be a real ball game.

Weeks ago, Pittsburgh football fans

at the Pitt-Penn State clash. But
now, with the Nittany team deﬁnitely

their usual mystery setting, the game
has revived some of that old-time
punch that was so apparent way back

Freshman Women End

Customs Rules Today

Blue, Gold Armbands Will

At Brunch Tomorrow Morning In Heinz House;
Committee, Senior Mentors Will Ofﬁciate

After today there will be some-
thing missing from the campus-——the
blue and gold felt armbands which
freshman women have worn for the
past six weeks.

After today back doors will be de-
serted, for freshman women will be
permitted to enter through the front
doors, sit on the benches in Alumni
Hall, forget their customs identiﬁca-
tion cards, and walk across the pop-
ular Upperclass Walk. Customs regu-
lations are over!

In honor of the new freedom, fresh-
man women will be entertained at a
Brunch tomorrow morning at Heinz
House. The popular deﬁnition of a
Brunch is “a combination of break-
fast and lunch,” but freshman women
will be given an opportunity to dis-
cover for themselves how the Customs
Committee ‘interprets the word when
they come to the party tomorrow at

Although the Program Committee

exciting Brunch ever given by the
Customs Committee.” The other
members of the committee are Helen
Akerman, C38, and Goldie Katz, C39.

Alice Rotzsch, C39, chairman of
the refreshment committee, promises
the freshman women “more food than
they can eat in a week,” while Ruth

I Two Carloads Per Day Keep
100 Stone Workers Busy
Inside Cathedral

 

With nearly 100 men employed and
Indiana limes-tone arriving now at the
rate of two carloads a day, work is
being pushed forward rapidly in the
Commons Room of the Cathedral.

In Bedford, Indiana, one mill is
devoting its entire facilities to the
preparation of the limestone while
three other plants in that city are
doing special work on the stone.

Only ten per cent of the limestone,
or approximately 40 carloads, have
been shipped to the University thus
far, it was pointed out by A. A. Klim-
check, of the University planning
department. It is expected, he said,
that the remainder of the 4,500 tons
of stone will have arrived by Jan-
uary 1, 1937.

As rapidly as it arrives, the lime-
stone is being put in place by a
crew of 12 stone setters. Arched en-
trances, pillars and walls are already
taking form, although the Commons
Room is not to be completed until
next Spring.

“The ventilating system of the
room, which is separated from that
of the Cathedral as a whole, is en-
tirely ﬁnished,” Mr. Klimcheck said,
“except for its operating machinery.”

MOCK TRIAL !

Law School Fraternities
Revive Custom Tonight

 

 

Tonight, perhaps about 10 o’clock,
late Cathedral stayers will undoubt-
edly hear an impassioned appeal to
the jury—-or, at least, a vigorous plea
that justice be done.

Three professional fraternities in
the School of Law will get together
tonight to revive the Mock Trial, an
old custom, which was allowed to
lapse a few years ago.

Elder W. Marshall, judge of Com-
mon Pleas Court, will be the presid-
ing judge and visitors at trial will
be empaneled as jurors.

Already Aaron Oliver, L37, has
been selected as the defendant. He
is charged by Stage Electricians’
Union, Local No. 000, with stopping
payment on a check made out to
the electricians.

A Bit Tangled Up

Defending lawyers will_ reply that
the mythical Landon-Lemke Super
College Glee‘ Club requested the ser-
vices of one electrician, but received
six. Therefore, say they, Defendant
Oliver was justiﬁed in stopping pay-
ment on the check.

Prosecuting attorneys at the trial
will be Leroy Lewis, L37, and Mer-
ritt Page, L38. Defending attorneys
will be George Schwartz, L37, and
Norman Landy, L37. The prosecu-
tion announces that it will bring Tony
Marion, L38; Bryson Schriner, L38,
and Fred Kiger, L39, as ..witnesses.
Defense attorneys have announced
that Aaron Lincoff, L37, and S01

Sociologist

Will Speak

World Traveler To Discuss
Problem Of Nationalism
At Inquiry Forum

 

 

Dr. Herbert A. Miller, world trav-
eler and professor of sociology at
Bryn Mawr College, will address In-
quiry Forum in a pre-Armistice Day
meeting on Monday. He will speak at
12:30 o’clock in Room 107, Alumni
Hall. on the subject, “A Way Out for
Nationalism.”

Since pre-war days Dr. Miller has
been making a study of the immi-
grant. He went to Bohemia, Poland,
Russia and Finland before the war to
observe these people in their native
lands and to make comparisons with
their conditions in the United States.

In 1915 he made a survey of the
immigrant in the schools of Cleveland
and wrote “The Immigrant and the
School,” which effected a radical
change throughout the country in the
methods of immigrant education.
After further research, he published
“Old World Traits Transplanted,” and
in 1933 “The Beginnings of Tomor-
row.”

Dr. Miller has spent years in Cen-
tral Europe, Russia, China, India and
countries in the Near East. He has
followed all the movements of these
countries and is personally acquainted
with many of their leaders.

The meeting is being held in co-
operation with the Emergency Peace
Campaign. Dr. Miller will also speak
before Community Forum Monday
evening.

ODAY, according to a front page “box,” lower left hand cor-

ner only 15 days remain in which to subscribe for The‘ 1937 Owl.

That is significant, not for its “15 days” ultimatum‘,-but be-,
cause another Owl campaign is rapidly reaching a climax.

. Last year it was discouraging‘ how few students showed inter-
est in the yearbook project——as evidenced by the slight support
given by every class except the graduating group. While it -is ad-
mitted that a book such as the Owl is fundamentally a “senior at-
traction” it also records other undergraduate activities, proportion-
ately. Especially will that be true of the 1937 ‘edition according

to early lay—out speciﬁcations.

But more than all this,_the University’s sesqui-centennial cele-
bration will be marked by the_present Owl staff as an undergradu-
ate tribute to the fourteenth oldest University in the country. One
hundred and _ﬁfty years of progress alone should “sell” most stu-
dents, seniors and lower class members alike, on the current edi-

tion of The Owl. ¥

Less than three hundred undergraduate, seniors excluded, sub-
scriptions is discouraging support from a student body as large as

this one.

Sometimes it is questionable whether some undergradu-

ate activities should be included, since the book is ﬁnanced pri-
marily by the senior class. Possibly freshman, sophomore and jun-
ior activities,‘while they do contribute partially, should be ex-
cluded if subscription support is not given.

The 1937 Owl needs the cooperation of a large number of

students.

the ﬁrst year cross-country men from
Penn State.

While little is known about the
caliber of the Lion yearlings, the
State varsity aggregation has com-
piled a re-c-or-d that goes cross country.

Wurferdurfer———Well, that gives
you an idea-of-some ofthe names
which have been coming into the
'.of‘fice "of Frank Carver, director of"
athletic publicity, in his contest for

been iawarded-' last week. But eveh
the casual ,obse51‘*5\‘rer ' can see by:
looking at the above samples of
the contributions that the contest
has to be continued.

Mr. Carver relates that only 30
or 40 namers handed in their stuff
and results “ﬁlled only the ﬁrst
six inches of the wastebasket.” Of

Notwi-thstanding this reversal-, they
have given good indications that
they are still composed--of charnpion- —
ship‘ stuff‘. Bellweather of the Lion
squad is a fast-stepping junior, Pete»
Olexy. ’

Before he even went to Penn'_ Stat-e
Olexy was a national cross-country

ﬁgure. In‘ 1933 hewon the national 0011139: Y011 can Submit 3-5 many

shill ITV1934 he Wa5°°he of the we could easily think. of 30 our-

four Polish’-Americans picked to com-
pete in the Polish Olympics.

As a college varsity runner, Olexy
hasn't been beaten in a dual meet.
He was chie-ﬂy responsible for the
Penn State victory over Pitt last
year. Olexy pulled in ﬁrst as the
Lions wiggled out a‘27-28 triumph.

High points in the Penn State rec-
ord this year are victories‘ over Syra-
cuse and Lehigh. Low scorers in the
Penn State victories have been How-
ard Downey, a Bellevue senior; Haz-
ard, Clark, Pierce, and Henderson.
They will all be in there running
through Schenley Park tomorrow.

Panthers Whip Tech, 19-36

Pitt's full strength which features
Tost, Leggin, Zamborski, Cook and
company, is in top running shape
which means that the race should be
the tops, too.

As the season swings along, the
Pitt cross-country team seems to
swing with it. Tuesday they swung
right through Carnegie Tech on a
19-36 score. “Red” Tost was in the
pink as he paced out a time of 23
minutes, 50 seconds, the best time
he has made this year over the course,
to beat out Pinkerton of Tech. They
raced down the home stretch togeth-
er but Tost pulled into ‘the lead just
before the ﬁnish line.

been even less fortunate. The ;open-

the Panther opening lineup.

The Pitt sophomores will be two
ends, Bill Daddio and Fab Hoﬁ’man;
a pair of guards, Al Lezouski and
Walt Raskowski;. a pair of halfbacks,
Curley Stebbins and Biggie Gold-
berg; a left tackle in Elmer Mercov-
sky, and a quarterback, Johnny
Cl1ickerneo. The three juniors will
be George Delich at right tackle, Don
Hensley at center, and Frank Pat-
rick at the fullback position.

Tomorrow’s game offers little in the
way of national honors for the win-
ner. Pitt has been whipped once and
tied once but has shown enough pow-
er to be rated ﬁfth in the national
standing. State, on the other hand,
has not gone quite so far as the Pan-
thers this season, yet they boast one
of their strongest teams in recent
years. After winning their ﬁrst game
this year, the_Nittany lads dropped
three in at row but came back strong
last week to wallop a tough Syracuse
eleven, 19-0.

of games the Panthers have played
with any team. In th epast 35 games
the Sutherland Scythe cut down 21
stalks, found 12 too tough and two
all even.

The State team that arrives in town
today is said to be one of the best
ever put out by Bob Higgins. Six
of the players are veterans who
helped throw a scare into the Pitts-
burgh team last year. Charlie Cher-
undolo, captain and center, Frank
Smith, a crack end, Roy Schuyl-er,
200-pound tackle‘, Tommy Silvano and
Frank O’Hara, hard running backs,
will all be there. At right guard will
be Johnny Econom-os, who played a
whale of a game for the State team
in'last year’s game.

Most of the visiting eyes will be on
Biggie Goldberg, the Panther candi-
date for an All-American berth. Big-
gie has attracted gobs of attention
from the country’s leading sports

writers and only last week the New

York scribes put their okay on him.

Sp-eaking of that true Blue and
Gold spirit here’s a “knock-out” of a
crepe formal for the Soph Hop or any
other formal in the near future. Nat-
urally, the dress is Coronation blue
trimmed in gold, which is sure to
bring out all your “Hail to Pitt” spir-
it. The narrow gold binding runs
down the front of the dress, around
the ﬂared skirt and binds the daring
low back. The jacket has a ﬂared
peplum, highneckline and long sleeves.
The bows at the neckline and on the
jacket are sure beau catchers! The
price—29.7 5. Other darling formals
start from 17.50. Remember the
Soph Shop, Thanksgiving formals,
Xmas and New Year’s. The formal
season is on, so here goes!
