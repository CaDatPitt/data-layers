It was a sunless day, a grey day all around.

Students, more restless in‘ classes than ever,
were anxiousto say Something about It, not quite
sure of what they wanted to say.

A new meaning was given to the phrase “Fact
of Life.” . ;

Grim young faces, calm, serious, indicated that
boys had suddenly become men, girls had become
women. ’ ‘ ' _

It was a day when professors whose lectures
consisted of «Time’s circulation ﬁgures for 1940,
of the value of insulin in treating psychological
diseases, of the decline of the Holy Roman Empire
met only with inattention, forgeting, squirming in
chairs. _ ' D '

The clipped voice of a radio announcer could
be heard in the Pitt News office, in room 132, in
the Faculty club at regular intervals: “We inter-
rupt this program to bring you a special news
bulletin. Nicaragua has just . . ."

Through the half-open window of a ground
floor classroom came the rhythmic dirgeof four
little newsboys walking the avenue and chorus-
ing over and over again, “War! War! War!” .

It was a day when University students _with
brothers in Pearl Harbor, students with friends

‘ once aware of the horrible value of radio, of the

telegram.

Remarks like “Let's go out and get soused,” “I
feel awful let down,” and the lack of remarks on
the part of some testified to a sense of ‘futility.
The silence which greeted the playing of the na-
tional anthem, the eyes narrowed to slits, the
hands tightened‘ till the knuckles showed white
testiﬁed to another attitude——assured determina-
tion.

One professor helped to lessen the tenseness by
reading to his class for 15 minutes a Mark Twain
children’s story. Another told his audience. he

pitied them—“them” the youth who didn’t know ~

where they were going, who had given up trying
to understand, Still another lectured for his full
hour on the formula of a contemporary novel; it
was 9:30 in the morning, and his students stared
dully at the dots on the lecturer’s tie.

It was the day when Tuck shop politicians were
in their glory; when the wide-eyedglamour girls
seemed strangely laughable when they coyly asked
“It it really so-o-o seeryus ?” ,

There was a growing maturity on campus, and
the elevator jokes fell‘ ﬂat.

People looked out the windows at the greying.
skies, punctuated with the orange flame of the

-Union Official Explains Causes
 OfD1'ff1'cuIt1'es in Indu

By . BLU EST ON E

Speaking on the subject, “Labor.

and National Defense,” Clinton S.

__ .'Golclen,- regional director of the

SVVOC, aslsertcd that indu;~‘trial un-
rest‘ is not caused by unions, but by
the refusal of einployers to accept
unioiﬁsiii in good faith.

Before unions accept any re-
siponsibility, there must. be more
evidence of employers’ willingness
to deal honestly, he said.

' , Golden said that unions were to
labor what subsidies and monop-
olies were to the farnier and immu-
falcturelr in combating the adverse
"effectsl of’t.he law of supply and
demand, and that only where there
are labor organizations do workers
haveany voice in determining job
conditions.

“Union - m.ana‘gement coopera-

'- tioii! :the ideal situation, but be-
_forei"tliis can be '_elfected,, employ-

ers"’aittempts to break" up labor or-'
ganizations must be abandoned,”

Gall!-‘eh contended.

D.?:il.}lI();l.lll‘Cll1§.{.‘_.lLll(§ sum-1 to “put
unions "in _their proper place,”_ he
said _th_at such attempts were at-
tempts‘ to destroy unionism.

Golden claimed that such accept-l
ance would remove the need and

demand‘ for thé1Jclosc'd ‘shop, and =

then proceeded to ridicule the the-

ory that the ,cl_os,ed shop in the; cap- ’
. tive gpiinesl would ‘~mean its exten-
’ 'sion' to the steel mills. ‘

EE3ji_o'iiiic iaction dire'cte_d against
the éinn1)loy*e1". will getllabor more.
than "fiilile atteinptslto forma po-
litica‘l.."fpa1'ty, he said. u _

Golden denounced the Smith
Billfas an attempt to curtail and
re-press‘ labor, and ‘predicted that

ing_"‘i'ndus'trial peace. will be real-

Dr, Eugene A. Gilmore, dean. of
the Sbhool of Law and former act-

pine islands, foresaw the Japanese
attack upon the islands, he declar-

Philippines was to be expected, for

 expand southward without having

some sort of arrangement or con-
trol of the Philippines. . _
“With Great. Britain and the
United States formally on record
as opposed to the expansion policy

becomes "a matter of what the

Campus Eyes
On Pitt's Role

Pitt students are in service in

mer University men are in Wash-
ington serving‘ in various defense
committees and organizations.
Ensign William Murchison, BA3 7,

In Hawaii are Andrew Cox, '39;

artillery which has been reported

Stationed in the Panama Canal

Zone are Lt. Joe Cohen, in the army
air corps defending the canal. En-
sign C. H. Crane, E41, is at the

I

As 13th Men's Fraternity 

will make application to the Inter-
Fraternity council for formal Uni-
versity recognition as the thir-
teenth men’s social fraternity on
campus.

Members of the club believe that
there is a deﬁnite demand for the
reviving of inactive Alpha Phi Del-
ta, Italian men’: fraternity, and

throughout this past year, have ’

proven it conclusively.

This year that the APD’s are {in- :31

ishing out is one of probation, set , ~ ~

by the Men’s Fraternity council, in ; 
which they must have met certain .

standards and requirements.

It has been the policy of the E ‘

APD Club to stress the importance

of good academic standing ﬁrst and ‘

to emphasize second, social, physi-
cal, and political programs oﬁered
by the school.

Many APD’s are members of oth-
er campus organizations such as
the Pitt News, Panther, Owl, var-

sity athletics, Men’s council, Cap-

and Gown, Pitt Players, Newman
club, Italian club, and numerous
honoraries. 

Paul F. Cerchiara, C42, presi-
dent of the 35 active APD’s, is
proud of their record and feels that
it will speak for itself when the
time comes. He says, “The APD
Club has been constantly striving
to accomplish a work that will
make it worthy of recognition as
a social fraternity. We have a well
planned, well rounded program
that is not very much diﬁerent
from that of the already existent
fraternities on campus.

“The 35 active members are a ﬁne
group of individuals who, though
they might have varied and vastly
opposite ' interests outside, inside
the University they are concerned

only with moulding themselves in- C

to a compact, fast-stepping organ-
ization that through academic and
social contacts can make progress
toward their appointed goal.

“The majority of our members are
sopomores and juniors and it is my
earnest hope that these boys along
with all the others will be right-
fully rewarded for the excellent
Work they are doing.

 

you enjoy the charm of its delicious ta¢te...and its cool,
clean after-sense of complete refreshment. Thirst asks noth-

ing more.
