By-Law Amendments Chri

Drawn By Night Times

By DEANNA LOUISE

By-laws giving the Night Times
autonomy from the School of
General Studies (SGS) Student
Cabinet Council are ready for
presentation to the Cabinet’s
judiciary committee, according to
former Night Times editor Bob
Podurgiel.

A proposal for the restructuring -

of SGS by-laws came after the
resignation of Podurgiel and news
editor Dan Kohut last week in
protest of measures that give SGS
authority to appoint the Night
Times editor and legal right of veto
on material printed in the paper.

Both editors claimed the by-laws
restrict the evening college news-
paper’s freedom of the press.

The proposed by-law amend-
ments drawn by Podurgiel, Kohut
and judiciary committee member
Bob Sable call for the Night Times
editor to be elected by staff vote and
abolish any cabinet role in the
newpaper’s elections.

’ The proposal also calls for
elimination of a clause stating “all
pertinent Student Cabinet material
shall be considered and published
for the student information.”

‘ Under the amendment proced-
ure, after judiciary committee
approval of the drafted by-laws,
they must be printed in one issue of
the Night Times for scrutiny by the
SGS student body.

Subsequently, Night Times
lobbyists can present their case

' before the public at the SGS cabinet

meeting, where students can voice
objections to the proposal.
Podurgiel said he hopes to
publish the proposed by-laws in the
next issue of the Night Times, so
they can be considered at the first
meeting of the newly elected council
in early April. '

UGE V
Pitt Must Recognize Election

After the resignation of both
editors, Sue Thompson, SGS
student agent, and present council
member Bill Bair assumed respon-
sibility for publishing the term’s
ﬁnal issue of the paper.

Originally, two issues were slated
for the remainder of the school
term. - _

Podurgiel said he and Kohut
would like to make a “tentative
reconciliation” with the present
board by helping them put out that
issue.

“We’d like to resume our duties
for the last issue of our term as
editors,” Podurgiel said. “We
want to work with the present
council putting out this paper and
with the newly elected council in
instituting by-law changes which
would give us more autonomy.”

“Actually, we never issued a
written resignation and feel we still

The Union of Graduate Employes
(UGE) will attempt to persuade
Pitt’s administration to respect the
results of last week's mock

collective bargaining election, A .

UGE spokeswoman said Friday.

In last week’s election, graduate
employes voted overwhelmingly in
favor of unionization, picking UGE
as their choice to represent them in
collective bargaining.

(GPSA) members, the Chancellor
said, ‘If any section of the

Pitt’s academic calendar for
.1977-78 will include an extra ﬁve
days of winter vacation that will
cause a one-week delay in the
beginning of spring session.

The Student Government Board

V expressed concern over the change

stating in a recent letter to Secretary

of the University Albert Van Dusen 

that the start of spring session of
May 1 and the end of the
examination period June 21 “may

seriously limit job opportunities of '

Pitt students  what is each year
becoming a more competitive
summer job market.”

Van Dusen said yesterday the
week delay will not damage the job
prospects of Pitt students. “The
tri-semester system still favors our
students, even if the term is delayed
two weeks.” A

According to Van Dusen, the
University administration proposed
the ﬁve-day addition to the winter

question of unionization, the
decision should be made by that
constituency.’ We are going to
remind him of that statement and
ask him to honor that committment
to democratic process,” UGE
spokeswoman Ronaele Novotny
said.

UGE is now in the process of
writing the Chancellor a formal
letter explaining the election
results,” according to Novotny.

“We’re open to any avenues of
communication to discuss the
situation with the Chancellor,”
UGE member Jim" Murphy said.

When asked about the prospects
of a strike, Novotny said, “At this
point, nothing is ruled out. Our

The winter ‘vacation will extend
from December 20 to January 9.

“There were many complaints
this year because administrators
and staff members did not have
enough time‘ to process records

between terms before students had »
to add/ drop this term,” Van Dusen -

said. V

He also stressed the delay would
conserve energy by closing all
non-essential University buildings
from December 24 to January 2.

According to Alex, Kaminsky,
director of plant services and
building maintenance, complete
shut down will save approximately
$7,000 per day.

In the letter to Van Dusen, SGB
also expressed its concern for the
ommission of references to relig-
ious holidays in next year’s
calendar.

“The Board perceives this as a
possible shift in responsibility. In
the past, the University informed
faculty and staff through its
calendar of religious holidays and
encouraged faculty and staff to
excuse students from classes and
examinations on religious holi-
days,” the letter states. “Now the
burden of informing faculty and,
staff lies with the students.”

Van Dusen explained the desig-
nation _of religious holidays was
ommitted on the calendar because
“a number of people felt that
rather then list all of the religious
holidays all references would b
deleted.” -

SG Requests Review

By BETSY NORMAN

The Student Government Board
has allocated $15,000 for remunera-
tion of selected student leaders
during the 1977-78 fiscal year.

It also directed a request for the
recreation of a task force to study
the issue of remunerations to the
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
Alfred Moye. ,

The present remunerations board
completed astudy of Pitt’s student
leader payment system three
months ago.

During that study the remunera-
tions board made significant
changes in the application process
upon which remuneration is based
and in the appeals and funding
procedures.

“Often, the priorities of the
remunerations board don't agree
with those of SGB. We’ve
discussed their criteria and how
they decided just who got how much
money,” SGB president Bernie
Payne said. “We also discussed
alternate ways to pay student
leaders other than by giving them
money, but the meeting did not
answer all our questions.”

Of RemunerotionsBoord

Each spring the remunerations
board screens applications from any
student leaders who feel a need for
remuneration.

After the screening process, the
student leaders are interviewed and
the board issues its recommenda-
tions to SGB.

“SGB is at a point now when they I

must decide who should get money
and how much they should get,”
Dave Tive, chairman of the
remunerations board said.

“We’re getting pretty close to
summer and the student leaders
need to know if and how much
they’ll get paid,” Tive said. People
who are in key positions to be
remunerated will be left hanging if a
new project is started. The students
won’t know what to do this summer
for money.

While the remunerations board

‘has taken no formal position, Tive

said, “I think the review we did in
the fall was a complete and
thorough job and another project
would be fruitless. The remunera-
tion process has to be examined
periodically, but another job is not
needed now.” I ’  A ' '

IlAI.I.Y!

in Support of Professors
    Yusef Ali and Paul Nyden

Who makes decisions at Pitt? When it
comes to hiring and firing of professors,
it seems that only the Posvar administra-

  tion does.

Apparently professors do not have
much decision-making power. The five
professors who comprised the Tenure
and Promotion Review Board in the Ny-
den case made recommendations that

I were totally rejected by Dean Jerome

Rosenberg. The 12 professors from the

Black Studies Department who voted
A unanimously to rehire Professor Yusef

All were also over-ruled by Dean Rosen-
berg.   *

Students are not allowed a voice in the
Ali and Nyden cases. No students, grad-
uate or undergraduate, were consulted
before these professors were fired.
Chancellor Posvar has so far refused to

  meet with students on these issues.

Dean Rosenberg has also refused to
take our opinions into consideration.

But we, as students, have a lot at stake. I

  We are concerned about what kind of

professors teach classes. We believe

we have the right to good teachers and

a variety of perspectives.

And we pay tuition that subsidizes pro- ,

fessors’ and administrators’ salaries.
Chancellor Posvar blames the Pennsyl-
vania legislature for not allocating Pitt

more money. Yet the Chancellor has

spent our tuition and tax dollars to de-

prive professors of their constitutional I

rights. They have spent over one million
dollars in fighting Dr. Sharon Johnson’s
sex discrimination suit—-if Pitt’s Legal
Department’ stopped harrassing these
professors, our tuition would be lowered.

Main Speaker: DR. HARRY EDWARDS
A black professor of sociology at Berk-
eley, California. Author ofthree books
on sociology of sports, Dr. Edwards
was the main organizer of the black
athlete’s boycott at the 1 968 Olympics
at Mexico. Like Professors Ali and Ny-
den, Professor Edwards has recently
beenfked. A

Other speakers will include students,
professors, labor leaders and commun-
ityleaders.

dents join us, the Chancellor will see the
need to speak with us. I

SGS President Wayne Roman-

personally am concerned, there is
no reconciliation between the two
organizations, and as long as I'm
1 president theywon’t be working on
the paper. They resigned so the

Romanowski said there was a
“lack of professionalism and
inability to communicate on the part
of the Night Times. ” concerning the
institution of the by-laws. He said
he could not reconcile the situation
with them.

His claim was made in response
to an earlier staterncnt by Podurgiel
that the Cabinet neglected its duty
to accomplish institutitizi of  .r:e*~:~

“But I can’t speak. for the entire
council, and can only say they have
to approve the Night Times request
to speak before the council before it
can be put on the agenda," Della
Valle said. ‘

Bair said the size of the last issue
has been cut and the Night times’
New York Times feature . wire
service cancelled to save “unneces-
sary expenses for the small issue."

He said the last issue will consist
mainly of SGS-related articles
written by SGS members, but added
he believes the last issue will be a
joint effort between the cabinet and
the Night Times.

At a meeting between SGS Dean

Steele Gow, Podurgiel and Kohut

Friday, Gow reportedly encouraged

, the Night Times staff to work with

the new council to first change the
by-laws and then to assume a
degree of ﬁnancial autonomy from
the Cabinet.‘

Podurgiel said, “We’re going to

take this one step at a time and hope
to eventually be responsible for the
own allocation of our funds, the
election of our own editor and hope
to obtain new facilities so we don’t
have to operate with SGS looking
over our shoulder."

Townhouses-Yes

When Oakland’s two resident groups oppose Pitt’s plan for
additional housing before Pittsburgh’s City Planning Commission
this week, they will be doing their watchdog stance over Oakland
expansion more harm than good. Pitt’s plan for townhouses to

:5.»

 

accommodate 80 people can improvethe quality of life in Oakland. j g
It is suspected that People’s Oakland and Oakland Directions, 7 - * 

Inc. (ODI) are against this plan merely to oppose any expansion of
Pitt into Oakland, even though the construction will make Oakland
a’ better place to live in more ways than one.

The construction site is currently a parking lot. Even though
parking is short in Oakland, surely people prefer a new townhouse
as a neighbor than a parking lot.
sacrificed for this housing will be replaced by the garage in the
professional quadrangle.

The townhouses will provide additional dormitory space for
students and offer better accommodations than the off-campus
housing offered by realtors. And perhaps this new building will
encourage other realtors to offer above-adequate housing in
Oakland.

Ideally, Pitt should be building a structure that would create
more than 80 new housing units.

the struggle they would give a full-fledged dormitory. These

townhouses offer a reasonable ‘compromise, especially when one
also considers the fact that the current dormitory crunch is

expected to disappear in a few years, making a large
accommodation useless. , ,

The administration should not misconstrue this as support to
throw together a building and forget about it. There are
responsibilities to building such a structure in Oakland.

This building must be maintained so -that it will be a pleasant
addition to Oakland for many a year. And while Pitt is at it.
could also refurbish the other off-campus housing units it owns to
make them welcome neighborhood additions.

As townhouses, these units have the potential to be the best
housing the University has to offer. An equitable decision

. ‘concerning who is to live there must be made. It is suggested that

graduate students and married undergraduates be given first chance
at this housing, since they are the ones forced to live off campus.
After that, the space could be given to undergraduates on a first-
come, first-served basis. S
Thesetownhouses are Pitt’s‘ response to a housing shortage in
Oakland and should be_ supported by ODI and People’s Oakland as
the move to make instead of slum lording. '

Nite Times Controls-No

The School of General Studies Student Cabinet Council by-laws
that give that body the power to determine what material the school
paper, the Night Times, can publish violate the ethic against
government interference with news reporting.

The by-laws require the Night Times personnel to consider for

 --publication and publish for student information “all pertinent
 ‘ ‘Student. Cabinet material.”~» The Cabinet also has the power to
~ , appoint the Night Timeseditor—in-chief.

Clearly, rules like these leave the Night Times in a position to be

 - misused as a publicity rag for the Student Cabinet.‘ Therefore, it is
I  important that the “byzlaws leave the "Night Times free to report’
i » what they consider newsworthy and the power to elect their own

editor.

George Van  I who has
gained a ’reput'fation"as. a Black
Action Society special envoy at this
sort of ‘event, was. one of the more
identiﬁables at the mike. There is
something about his pronunciation
of “repression” that adds a special
zing to the word. He spits it out with
vigor, with mockery. . Almost
sneering, he says it: ‘ ‘wree-PRISI-L
in.” Quickly: “wree-PRISH-in.”
Like rapid-fire: “wree-PRISH-in.”
Like the smiling leaﬂetters and
sticker pressers who’ve littered

their/paper across campus, we’re
gonna miss George up there. Along
with the familiar nameless faces of
the Nyden and Ali show, which ends
its campus run April 30, it’ll be
who-knows-when before we see
George and the gang, flanked by
props (one of them this time, “No
More Racist Political Repression at
Pitt”) and an occasional guest

(remember Angela doing her thing —

on the McCarthyism circuit).

IMPRESSIONS

And, looking back, if you’d seen
one Nyden rally, you’d seen ’em all.
No big crowd. Nobody new, which
has really peeked away at me.
Seriously, if the faculty came close
to unionizing itself last year, why
haven’t any of the more inspired

. freedom-ﬁghters cast their lot with

Nyden and Ali? Who knows?
After a couple of Nyden students

. spoke on the redeeming benefits of

their professor’s courses, one of the
stars finally stepped up. ‘ ‘If Pitt can
become number one in football in
two years, it can become number
one in black studies in two yearsl”
Yusef Ali spouted.

And English and ‘history and
chemistry. and ‘medicine and
engineering and psychology... But
not necessarily in that order, of
course.

And then there appeared‘ a

sudden crowd swell. That short,
black topcoated Nyden approached
the mike. “There’s a conspiracy in
Pitt education from Posvar down,”
he railed. The words echoed coldly
across Bigelow to the Student Union
walls.

A man just breathed his last for
all to see. The crowd beneath the
mike thickened——was it Nyden or
just the 12:50 rush?

‘ ‘I had to laugh when Posvar went
to Harrisburg last week to ask the
legislature for more money,”
Nyden said.

Nyden would have been the first
to cry if Posvar hadn’t.

And so it goes. Those who
labored in the bright sun and the

. arctic wind to hear the more=than-

twice-told tales had been a faithful"
group. And this was it, the last
roundup. Their faces burned with
frost, their noses snivelled; yet
under their arms there was sweat,
in their shoes and behind their
necks there was sweat.

Eventhose of the inner circle who
crouched behind the hand-painted
signs, held steady for an hour, must
have found grit in every crack and
crease of flesh. But where to now?
They didn’t know.

Why hadn’t they gathered the
numbers they thought they de-
served? Who could tell?

It was just one of those days,
though. The sun was hot, the air
was cold and so how do you dress?
Theyfdidn’t know. ' ‘

if exist.

In response to the red-baiting
-attack in Friday’s Pitt News by law
student Dan Mulholland, I would
like to set straight some of the
errors concerning the activities of
the National Lawyer's Guild and
the Civil Liberties Coalition.

Where our anti-communist
classmate would like to imagine an
ACLU conspiracy to set loose
demonic criminals on society so as
to weaken it in preparation for
eventual takeover, there actually
are two new student-led organiza-
tions, neither of which was begun
by the ACLU.

The impetus for the creation of
both groups‘ was with a small
number of first-year students who
desired to put part‘ of their time" in
law school to use in community
projects of a progressive nature,
some of which Mulholland correctly
identiﬁed. Another purpose was to
spark debate inside the ‘law school
on topics not considered in what
are typically very dry and Bar
exam-oriented courses.

The reason that there are two
groups is that some of the students
desired to be part of a national
organization with its variety of
activities, meetings, and projects,
etc., while others did not want to
sacrifice the freedom of being
entirely separate, and so while the
two groups frequently cooperate in
sponsoring speakers and even
raising funds each has its own
identity. Mulholland’s “coalition
of the Guild and other left-wing
groups in the law school” does not
There are no such other
groups. And some of the members
of the two groups may consider
themselves left-wing, many more
describe themselves as progressive
or liberal. Mulholland’s identiﬁca-
tion with Joe McCarthy, the
demogague who not so long ago
tried to create his own brandof
authoritarianism through putting
the fear of communism in people,
probably more than anything I
could say in this letter, shows
clearly where Mr. Mulholland’s
head is at.

, Not at Pitt.

I am currently‘ a second-term
freshman enrolled in CAS at the
University of Pittsburgh. I was
under the impression that one
would receive a quality education
when he attended a college or
university. However, this seems to
be an overstatement.

I walked into a class last year to
ﬁnd a graduate student taking the
place of the professor I had signed
up for. ‘Throughout the course of
the year, my classmates and I
constantly would correct problems
the instructor would be doing on
the board. Sometimes he could not
do a problem that had, been

I assigned and many times he could

not answer our questions. It was
suggested that I locate a tutor, but
why should I have to do so because
of an incompetent instructor? I am
paying money to be taught by a
competent instructor, not a student
who has a few years on me and is
still being taught the course
himself.

I have also come in contact with a
lot of incompetent TA’s, as have
many other students I ' have
questioned. I realize that nobody is
perfect, but this situation is a little
out of hand. There is a policy for
the recruitment of TA’s, TF’s and
graduate assistants, but it obvious-
ly is not being followed.

Another concern of mine is that
of TA’s, professors, etc., who are
not keeping announced office

In the March 7 Pitt News, Larry
Cole criticized the. Union of
Graduate Employes (UGE) for
supporting proposals aimed at
reversing the decline in black
enrollment at the University. Mr.
Cole suggests that the reason for
the decline in black enrollment is
that “blacks...cannot ﬁnd the
ambition or time to apply to this
University.” His remarks are not
only mistaken but have racist
overtones as well.

Chancellor Posvar pointed out the

real reason for the decline in black .

enrollment’ in his March 10
testimony to the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee in Harrisburg.
The reason is that in the last five
years Pitt's tuition has been rising
twice as fast as-the income of the
average family.

Since its participation in START-
UP, the Student Government
Board’s anti-tuition hike campaign

4

of 1975, UGE has ' consistently
opposed tuition increases at this
University.

Mr. Cole asserts that unioniza-
tions of TA’s, TF’s, GSA’s and
GSR’s will inevitably result in
further tuition increases, but does
not prove why this must be so.

UGE is working for a reduction of
tuition by fighting for re-ordering of
the University's priorities. Today
the University spends millionson
administrative salaries (half of
Pitt’s administrators are paid more
than $30,000 per year). The
University spends millions more
opposing unionization and the
Sharon Johnson sex discrimination
suit.

tuition rates, providing better

In regard to your editorial of

The purpose of ROTC is to train

purpose of education is to liberalize‘
and-humanize, at least-in part so
that individuals can resist the

Pitt, Military Structured Alike

The paragraph that follows is
taken directly from Gary Govert’s
piece “On Miltary Slogan Slin-
gers” in the issue of March 9. I
capitalize some words for reasons
to become obvious:

‘fMILITARY people, especially
OFFICERS, have to deal with the
implications of living in a caste
system, a system‘ that affords
upper—class social status and a
relatively regal standard ofiliving, a
system that usually channels
minorities and economically disad-
vantaged people into the lower
class. Those in charge of these
things say that such a system IS A
NECESSARY EVIL, vital to DIS-
CIPLINE AND EFFICIENCY.
Perhaps it is, but I’ve seldom seen
any of them suffering over the
inequity of it all. I wonder how

many ROTC CADETS have consid-
ered it.”

Now let’s try rewording the same
paragraph:

“ACADEMIC people, especially
ADMINISTRATORS, have to deal
with the implications of living in a
caste system, a system that affords
upper—class social status and a
relatively regal standard of living a

system that usually channels.

minorities and economically disad-
vantaged people into the lower
class. Those in charge of these
things say that such a system, IF
PARTLY HIDDEN BEHIND A
VEIL OF IMAGINARY ACADEM-
IC “COLLEGIALITY," IS A
NECESSARY EVIL, vital to SYS-
TEMATIC LEARNING AND PRO-
DUCT IVE EDUCATION. Perhaps

it is, but I've seldom seen any of »

them suffering over the inequity of
it all. I wonder how many
STUDENTS have considered it."
The point? Organizations today
are structured pretty much the
same everywhere. I was reminded
of this today(Ma1'Ch 10)as I noticed
a substantial load of ﬂoral displays
being delivered to the scheduled
lavish dinner in the Chancellor’s
suite. The combined salaries and
prerequisites of senior university
administrators would be the envy
of a number of four-star generals.
What about the faculty? Just an
“in-between" caste. A “regal

standard of living” is reserved for _

those on top.

‘Mr. Legs’ Contest

A By PAMELA EUSI

You say you need a break from
papers and finals and don’t know
where to go? Now that the warm
weather is almost upon us, why not
take a short stroll up the road to see
the Annual Spring Flower Show at
Phipps Conservatory in Schenley
Park?

Two and one half acres of ﬂoral
beauty are contained under the
glass Ftructures of the conserva-
tory. f you get a chance to see the

 

Persons of all ages, shapes and sizes turned out this
weekend for the 83rd Annual Spring Flower Show at the
Phipps Conservatory in Schenley Park. Cameras clicked,

buds while they’re just beginning
to bloom now, you can catch them

in another couple of weeks when

they’re in their prime.

As you enter the first exhibit, the
colors strike the viewing crowd with
spots of white, blue and lavender
hydrangeas surrounded by clusters
of daisy-like cineria. Next on the
tour is the Broderie Garden,
arranged in the manner of a 17th
century French embroidery pattern,
which features hyacinths, ka1anch-
oes or pocketbook plants and

beauty.

Dorm Males Half --Exposed  

By PATTY TASCARELLA

For centuries, beauty contests
have been held only for women.
Who's got the prettiest face, who’s
got the sexiest build, who’s ahead
of the field in the talent division?
Who’ll represent the state of
Pennsylvania, the kumquat pickers
of America, the yo-yo makers
union? One thing for sure, it’s
never a guy. Or is it"?

Thursday night, in a unique bit
of role reversal, the Resident
Student Association (RSA.) turned
the tables on tradition with the
“Mr. Sexy Legs Contest." The
competition, open to all male.
resident students, offered a $5,,
first prize and 17 men showed up in
the Towers Main Lobby for the
judging.

“Yeah, it’s sexist, but I figured
it’s men’s time," said one entry as

he fastened an identification
number to his gym shorts. “It's
our turn.”

To eliminate any bias, the

contestants were viewed from
behind a screen that stopped about
an inch below waist level. But that
didn’t dampen enthusiasm from
either side of the curtain. The
crowd could easily identify their
representatives and friends by a

tell-tale pair of Adidas or sloppy‘

argyles. And one contestant yelled
to his fellow competitors. “Hey
guys. don’t forget to write your

ing an organization——but all had
supporters on whose lung power
the ﬁnal decision hinged. ,

A panel of three judges, Pavla
Sim, Karen Roos and Paula Simon,
all resident assistants (RAs) from

Tower C, had the task of judging
the applause. Admittedly, RAs
have had experience with high
decible levels. But as to their
knowledge of men’s legs, they
proved to be even more specific
and succinct than when they inform
you that your stereo is too loud or
your booze supply isn’t allowed in
the residence halls, or even that
you bed squeaks too much for the
privacy of the person who lives
below you.

“We’re looking for .length,
muscle tone, hairiness, tan,” they
chorused. “We don’t want them to
be pale and ugly.”

The contestants were brought
out in groups of four. The crowd
cheered and whistled. Those on
display ﬂexed their calf muscles,
turned around for full display and
hiked their gym trunks even
higher. The guys backstage paced
nervously.

A.T. Hunigan got a C- on his
two-page paper on the role of Attila
the Hun in urban development.

You know A.T. Hunigan. he's a
senior.

‘ ‘The only comment Dr. Huniwell
wrote on my paper was ‘Solwhat? ’ in
three-inch letters,” Hunigan said,
clenching his ﬁsts. A

Unfortunately, Hunigan’s major

0 is Hun. Will he get a job in his ﬁeld

next month? Will he plunder for a
living or be unemployed? He's
scared harmless. ‘

The undergraduate Hun decided
to visit the University Placement
Ofﬁce at 219 Student Union; He

9 wanted to ask Dan Nagy,’ coordina-

tor of placement and career
development, what he should ex-
pect when job hunting. Hunigan
wanted to know how to accept the
rejection of employers.

. He wanted to ask these things but

his words came out funny.

“Help me or I’ll take all your
gold,” he said.

Rather than tell the 6-2 wide
blond to take a roll, Nagy decided to
help him.

Nagy said students should see
him before their senior year.

“We've been trying to tell
underclassmen what’s being looked
for out there in the real world,”
Nagy said.

Grades and personal recom-
mendations are not as important to
employers as are other factors.
Participation in college activities,
careful selection of courses and,
most importantly, practical work
experience will impress employers.
A minor in business or computer
science is often valuable.

“It’s too late,” Hunigan said,
dropping his head to his hands, his
books to the floor, his knife from his
pocket. “I’m a senior.

closest I ever got to an activity,’ ’ he
continued. “It was O.K. most, uh,
no——half the time. Andl don’t think
my minor is business. I just want to
know what to do now.”

Nagy explained that seniors
should send letters of application
(including a resume) to employers.
If an employer shows interest, the
student will be granted one or two
interviews.

“You mean I.’ll have to sell

so cheap.”

The Placement Ofﬁce helps
students write resumes and ar-
ranges mock job interviews that are
videotaped so students can see their

’mistakes.

“It’s not what they say as much
as how they say it,” Nagy said.
“Eye contact and hand movements
are. important. ’ ’

I Nagy said employers are looking
for people with the abilityto speak
and write well. Much of the advice
given by the Placement Office deals
with communication skills.

“No sweat,” Hunigan said. “No
perspiration. It’s not hard.
Difﬁcult. Talking ain't. Aren't. I’m
doomed, ain’t I, sir?”

“Some get discouraged too soon
in the job market,” Nagy said.

‘ ‘The people who stay in the market
the longest will get jobs.”

Nagy said the best job hunting
attitude is one that includes
perseverance, competitiveness and
accepting the fact most ﬁelds attract
more graduates than provide jobs.

“Rejection is part of the game,”
Nagy said.

A.T. Hunigan was grateful to
Nagy for his encouragment and
advice. He wanted to thank him but
couldn't ﬁnd the words. As he left

  Studio To Open Chekov Play

By MREA csoRaA

lt’s been said that a Chekov play
is not complete without a gunshot
ripping through its script. But Don
Eisen, the director of Anton
Chekov’s “Three Sisters,” which
opens at the Studio Theatre
Wednesday, denies Chekov’s melo-
dramatics.

“He’s not melodramatic, if you
mean the staging of heavy,
climactic themes for the purpose of
emotional tittalation. In fact, if
anything, Chekov undercuts the
dramatic possibilities of his
scenes,” Eisen said.

“He’s more interested in the
psychological after-effects of an

_ action, then the depiction of its

melodrama,

“If Chekov was doing ‘A Street
Named Desire,’ he would have its
rape scene occur between the acts

THE DIRECTOR SPEAKS

and pick up the discussion of it over
breakfast the next day.

“He’s "very understated,” said
Eisen, who taught English at
Indiana University of Pennsylvania
before coming to Pitt as a doctoral
student of theatre. ‘ ‘His characters
sit around acting bored; aware of,
but not admitting to the tensions
bubbling under the surface.”

This is what intrigues Chekov, he

says: how all his characters suffer

some misery. but use the appear-
ance of normalcy as a cover.

:i_ he Fox’

“In the ‘Three Sisters,’ Olga,
the eldest, is overﬂowing with love,
but has no one to give it to. Marsha,
the middle sister, is the ﬁery,
passionate one. . She is married to
the wrong man and later falls in love
with a true love. The youngest,
Irina, is the prettiest of the three,
the one whom everyone adores but
who is incapable of love herself.

“The eldest is a schoolteacher, a
job she complains ’ gives her
headaches-. Marsha walks around
in a daze looking for a diversion to
sustain her in a loveless marriage.
And Irina, who says she wants to
serve humanity, goes from one job
to another, unsatisfied,” said
Eisen.

“The three long to return to their
home town, Moscow, blaming their
misery on the 11 years they spent
stationed in the rural Russian
provinces with their military father.
But their father died three years
ago, leaving them no reason to stay
in the hated provinces. Yet they
stay.” ‘

In the production, which he is A

producing as an independent
project towards his Ph.D., Eisen
argues that in their longing for
Moscow, the three sisters are
searching for an element that would
bring their lives into focus.

“The traditional approach to this
play is the three sisters portray the
dying Russian aristocracy on the
eve of the Revolution. With their
inability to take control of their

destinies, they represent an effete
aristocracy that is not willing, nor
able, to change.

‘‘I, ’ ’ Eisen argues, “interpret the
three’s non _ initiative on a
psychological level.

“Shortly before moving to the
provinces 11 years before,their
mother died. Therefore, I see the
longing for Moscow as a yearning
for the past and all the happiness
associated with it and their mother.
The three sisters’ helplessness, I
think, stems from an arrested
development when they lost

:her.

“That’s why they constantly talk
about the beauty of life in Moscow.
But they don’t go to Moscow.
Underneath they realize that
Moscow is an illusion.”

One by one, Eisen says, the three
sisters give up the ‘ dream of
Moscow.

“That’s the positiveness in the
play. They realize that Moscow is a
dream that can never exist again.

The Studio Theatre’s production of Anton Chekov’s “The Three Sisters” is

now in its final stages of rehearsing. The show opens on Wednesday night.

“Chekov presents us with a
heart-rendering view of their life.
Each sister is locked into a behavior
pattern she cannot break from.

But they face this realization
with courage.

“They remain where they are:
despite the headaches, Olga

goes back to her husband; and Irina
goes off to ‘serve’ at a job she
despises.

“Yet it’s with positiveness and
courage that Irina closes the play,
with lines that say something like:

‘We will go on living. We mus?

go on living..., any minute now we
will find out what we are living

for.’ ”

Making An Old Play New

Pittsburgh City Players
Drected by Steven Pearson

People whose tastes favor
Elizabethan may want to take in the

 

Ian Seidrman_ plays olpone, an unusual character in the current

current production of the City
Players (CP) at the Allegheny
Community Theatre. Steve Pearson
has dusted off Ben Jonson’s almost
400-year-old play “Volpone” and
adapted it for modern-day audi-
ences under the title “The Fox,”
which will run through April 23.

  
   

production at the City Players’, “The Fox.”

This play is based on the
legendary hungry fox who feigned
death in order to catch a dinner of
predatory birds who ﬂocked around
him to feast on his carcass.
Jonson’s Volpone (played by Ian

Schneiderman) is a bored man of A’

wealth who amuses himself by
pretending to be dying, thereby
attracting two-faced friends to his
bedchamber with gifts of gold and
diamonds to win his affection and be
named in his will.

The -tliesme of the play is ‘the
unnaturalness of avarice and the
cast is peopled with legacy-seekers
who grow more and more foolish as
they think Volpone grows closer and
closer to death. The main
characters personify birds of
carrion: Voltore, played by S. Dan,

Success In Concert

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

‘Hoping “your” next single or

vehicle to put “your” name up on
the neon marquee is a popular
fantasy that has helped many a
musician through lean periods.

For veteran British keyboard
player and Star Trekker Manfred
Mann, that fantasy has come true
with the success of his brilliant
reworking of Bruce Springsteen’s
New J ersey-based adolescent musi-
cal ballad, “Blinded By the Light.”

‘Late show: Capturing Old Time Spirit

By M.C. PILECKI

Late Show
at the Fiesta
by Robert Benton

Ah, the good old days-

Here’s another movie trying (in
part, anyway) to capture the spirit
of the so-called “good old days” of
moviedom-—“The Late Show,” an
aptly titled ﬁlm celebrating a genre
to be found only on late night TV.

“Late Show” is a salute mixed
with satire of old-time detective
stories, the sort that always took
place in Los Angeles and involved
various murders, a convoluted plot
and a tough-talking, hard-drinking
gumshoe often seeking to avenge
his, partner’s death. You remem-
ber the type—Sam Spade or Phillip
Marlow, never cracking a smile
while dealing with various hoods
and beautiful ladies, all trying to do
him in.

This story, though, is a bit

_updated. The detective from post

WW II LA is older, out of place in
modern times. Ira Wells (Art
Carney) is beyond drinking (bleed-
ing ulcer), but he still talks tough,
shoots fast and never smiles.
When his old friend and partner
Harry Regan (Howard Duff) dies
literally at his door, Wells takes it
upon himself to track down his
killer.

All very Raymond Chandler so
far, eh? Well, not much longer. It
seems Regan’s case was to find a
missing eat (right), stolen from
Margo (Lily Tomlin), a spaced-out,
“modem” woman.

Completing the cast of prota-
gonists is Charlie Hatter (Bill
Macy), a sleazy businessman of
unstated business who's just as
much at home in old Bogey ﬂick as
in modern LA. He serves to get
Wells and Margo together, not to
mention a lot of unmentionable
types.

Giving away any more of the plot
would be cheating, but sufﬁce it to
say that “Late Show” works often.

lt’s occasionally funny and occa-
sionally interesting as only the
old-time detective stories can be. -It
does tend to be uneven, though,
and the veering from grey hued
detective yarn to garish modern
farce—-as exemplified b the two

 

 

  
 

main characters—can be dizzying
at times.

Every time Wells’ gritty man-
hunt threatens to become too
serious, Margo enters dressed in

United States. Manfred Mann’s
Earth Band didn’t’ sell many
albums, plus, the band never”
headlined concerts—even in the
smallest halls.

Instead, they were forced to plaéﬂ
second and third ﬁddle to sue '
obnoxious heavy metal acts as Uriah
Heep, Blue Oyster Cult and Kiss.

What was disheartening for

' Mann was knowing that his group

far outdistanced the bands they
opened for in ability, knowledge
and class.

The bespecticled Mann broke
onto the music scene strong back in

1964 with the poppish and simple!“

single, “Do Wah Diddy.” But after
that overplayed tune’s success, .
Mann’s only link in the musical stat’!
chain was with Bob Dylan’s
whimsical ballad, “The Mighty
Quinn" in 1967.

After kicking around in the early
’70s with a progressive but
misguided band called Chapter III,
Mann created the Earth Band,
which over the years has turned out
some brilliant originals (“On the
Road to Babylon” and “The Good}
Earth”) while doing refreshing and
better-sounding renditions of seviw
eral Dylan and Springsteen songs.

With the success of “Blinded By
the Light,” Manfred Mann’s Earth
Band headlined in Pittsburgh for
the first time last Thursday night at
the Stanley Theater and proved that
they are more than just a one-hit
wonder. .

Their set was concise, of high

professional quality and surpris-I’

ingly energetic. Most space rockers
look as if they’ve just been pulled
from underneath an ultra-violet
light. They play their music and
stand like statues, letting the light
show do all the visual tricks.

rock band, except with one

convinced he will outlive Volpone,

Volpone his sole heir, hoping
Volpone will return the compliment.

Unfortunately for Volpone, Mos-
ca decides he likes being rich, and
everyone winds up in court where
their scheming is uncovered and
duly punished.

Pearson, a regular CP member
and a part-time teacher at Pitt,
devoted all his efforts to directing
his first play off the Carnegie
Mellon University campus, where

he is working toward a master’s\\«

degree.

Pearson has rewritten almost all
of the play, eliminating archaic
words and phrases that would mean
nothing to many in his audience.

“I wanted to be as faithful to
Jonson as possible, but to make the
construction of the syntax more
available to the audience,” Pearson
said.

He succeeded remarkably well,
because other than the deletion of
an uninteresting subplot involving a
Politique Would-Be, the original
contours of the play are intact. The
loss of some of Jonson’s humorous
innuendos in the rewrite is more
than -compensated for with fresh
injections of humor given the story
by Pearson and his cast.

Pearson has added a fool (played
by Barbara Knowles) who pulls
Jonson’s play together marvelously

well as she dances in and out of
scenes, accenting changes of pace,
offering narrative comments and
giving the play added cohesion.
(The original play did include a fool,
but it was a minor part.)

The most impressive coup in
this production, however, is the
scenery. Working with set designer
Frederick Chuang, Pearson has

carried off a marriage of classical p

theme and innovative setting.
Wooden floors that are crooked and
uneven bend upward from Vol-
pone’s bedchamber to exits on the
second-story, side balconies of thc
theatre.

Ramps and steps twist around
and down into a central stage in a
way that suggests the fox’s hole and
entrapment. The symbolism is not
obtrusive, however, and the
ﬂoor-wall construction is put to

. good use. .

Chuang explains the setting is
abstract because it must be ﬂexible
for the scene changes. Through
stylization in movements, the cast
utilizes its surroundings to convey
ideas not actually spoken; objects
and people that aren’t really there
are easily imagined by the
audience.

From ’Volpone’
To ’The Fo>(

(Continued from Page 11)

As for the cast, the most
enjoyable action is the good timing
of the characters as objects and
people—yes, people—are noncha-
lantly thrown here and there by
various characters and caught by
others on a different level or in a
different corner of the stage where
attention is then turned for new
developments.

Especially funny are the pushes
and shoves given the near-sighted
and feeble Corbaccio who always
manages to land on his feet, and the
timely ducking of the innocent and
beautiful Celia (Diane Heles) as
Volpone and Bonario swish their
swords around her head in battle
over her.

All this is not to say the play
doesn’t drag a little. But that is no
fault of Pearson’s. A certain
shallowness is present even in
Jonson’s original version, because
of a lack of striking character
change (although there is a
resolution of sorts to the story) and

also the lack of a hero emerging
from the plot to contrast and
heighten the downfall
aspiring legacy-seekers.

Overall, the CP members have
done a ﬁne job in executing
Jonson’s idea of the fox who “got
skinned himself.” That only seven

players filled nine roles wasn't too '

disturbing because of clever use of
the props and simple costume
adaptations. Claude Purdy’s
double performance as Raven
Corbaccio and son Bonario was
extremely good. Once again Purdy
has displayed his versatility.

If anything, Pearson has been too
faithful to J onson. He mentioned he
and the cast are still tightening up

some of the lines, especially in the.

third act.

He would do well to take more
liberties and move further away
from Jonson’s original play’,

been good and in that direction lies.

craziness threatens to overwhelm
the movie, he calls her “doll” and
beats somebody up-—or is beaten
up himself, in true detective style.

As for the mystery part, it’s
passable enough, but a few more
suspects and suspicious characters
littering the screen wouldn’t have
hurt. Eugene Roche is pretty good
as the over-commercialized fence
and John Cansidine is great as his
slippery bodyguard, but Joanna
Cassidy as his wife leaves some-
thing to be desired (in her acting,
that is). She makes a great
decorative object, but unfortunate-
ly that’s all she is.

Carney, though, as the detective
past his prime, is not all one would

grim enough, he lacks the natural

Netters Southem-Fried

By BRUCE GERSON

After returning from a ﬁve-day
winless roadtrip through the South,
Pitt tennis coach George Dieffen-
bach shouldn’t be very optimistic.
But he is.

“The trip has been an excellent
addition to the tennis program at
Pitt," Dieffenbach stated. ‘‘It was
an exciting trip with many good
matches. All seven players who

9 came with us learned a lot from the

0

experience and became better
tennis players as a result.”

The Panthers traveled to the
campuses, of such tennis-talented
schools as Virginia Tech, Guilford
College, North Carolina State, duke
University and Hampden-Sydney
College.

Turning in some ﬁne perfor-
mances for Pitt were Mike and
Harry Habbel.Tom Liebenguth and
Kevin Quay.

The staggering Pitt basketball
program received an immediate
boost last week when Brashear

Sam Clancy signed a letter-of-
intent with the Panthers. The
signing marked the third consecu-
tive year in which Pitt basketball
coach Tim Grgurich has success-
fully recruited the Pittsburgh City
League's top prospects, including
Peabody’s Melvin Bennett (now
‘with the NBA’s Indiana Pacers)
and former Schenley Spartans
Kelvin Smith, Wayne Williams and
Nathan (Sonny) Lewis.

Clancy, who has narrowed his
college choices to North Carolina
State and Pitt, led Brashear
(formerly Fifth Avenue) to three
straight city championships plus a
state championship during the
1975-76 season in which a
prolonged teachers’ strike forced
Fifth Avenue to play only 15
games—all victories. During that
championship year, Clancy aver-
aged 21 points and 14 rebounds
while hitting on 63 percent of his
shots from the ﬂoor. This past
year, he averaged over 20 points
and 20caroms for Brashear, which

was eliminated from the PIAA .

playoffs by Beaver Falls, 58-46.

sandwiched in between those two
victories, Habbel played Ruby

Porges, an international tennis star
who plays on Israel's Davis Cup
team, had to struggle to bypass
Habbel, 6-4, 7-5.

Liebenguth, Pitt’s top seed,
scored -a three-set victory over
Guilford's Mark Solomon (brother
of tennis pro Harold Solomon) and
later played well against John Sardi
Jr. from North Carolina State, a
top-notch star in the Atlantic Coast
Conference.

Harry Habbel teamed with twin

Ian Valentine of Hampden-Sydney,

“an excellent doubles match.”

“The trip exposed us to good
weather and good competition,"
Dieffenbach claimed. “We kept
our spirits up and kept fighting. It
prepared us mentally and physi-
cally for our upcoming season. We
will deﬁnitely do it again next

“Super Sunday” Super

Entertainment

Charity began at Chartiers Valley High School gym yesterday
afternoon as a basketball squad made up of the National Champion Pitt
Panther football team defeated a Pittsburgh Steelers roundball crew,
65-61, in a beneﬁt for Children's Hospital.

The event, sponsored by McDonald’s, was billed as “Super Sunday”

and lived up to its advertisement.

In the preliminary game, the media All-Stars, led by WTAE-TV’s
Steve Zabriskie’s hot shooting and WIIC-TV’s Wayne Van Dyne’s timely
rebounding, edged a spunky Pennsylvania girls All-Star squad (the
same squad that represented the United States in a national tournament

in Peru), 32-31.

statistics, crashing the boards is
probably Clancy’s number one
expertise and, judging from Pitt’s
rebounding performances last sea-
son, his arrival on the Oakland
campus couldn't have come at a-
better time. The Panthers were
out-rebounded in most of their
games last year, so Clancy’s
strength and jumping ability could
be a welcome relief for Larry Harris
Mike Rice and Ed Scheuermann,
who were forced to carry the brunt
of the rebounding load much of last
season. 2

Clancy was also an All-City
tackle in high school and possesses
surprising agility and quickness for
an athlete his size. It had been
assumed that Clancy would stick to
basketball when the time came for

choosing his collegiate career.

Pittsburgh fans will get an early
glimpse of Clancy when he

participates in [the Dapper Dan‘

Roundball Classic Friday night for
the Pennsylvania All Stars. Other
top names slated for the classic are
New York's Albert King and

Wayne McKoy, along with West \

Philadelphia High’s Eugene
Banks.

The signing of Clancy by no
means signiﬁes the end of Pitt’s
recruiting. Tim Grgurich and his

V staff are currently seeking the

service of Cleveland East Tech
High School’s James Smith,
Allegheny Community College’s
Terry Peavey, Fox Chapel’s Stu

DeStout Wrestles With

The Panthers-Steelers match followed.

It was nip-and-tuck throughout
the contest, as the media All-Stars
jumped off to an early 5-0
ﬁrst-period lead and never trailed.

With less than two minutes
remaining in the game, the girls’
All-Stars -pulled strategy that
reeked of Sigmund Freud when,
down by ﬁve points, the entire
squad was put on the ﬂoor to insure
an effective full-court press. The
plan partially worked—the girls
moved to within one point, only to

media.

Pitt jumped out to a

commanding 10-tally lead,-due to the shining performances of scoring
leader J .C. Wilson and the rebounding ability of Randy Holloway and
Gordon Jones. Jones dazzled the crowd with his unbelievable leaps, at
times hanging from the basket rims on his way down from self-imposed

ﬂight. But the Steelers, via Franco
Harris’ offensive thrusts, bounced
back to tie‘ the game at the half,
29-29.

Halftime was as interesting as
the contest itself; Harris beat Tony
Dorsett in a one-on-one match,
22-12, while the Panthers shocked
the Steelers in a tug-of-war, pulling
the colored flag to their side in an
incredible 23 seconds. A

Pitt opened with an awesome
offensive attack in the third quarter,
building up a 51-42 lead. But the
Steelers came back once again,
narrowing the gap to the ﬁnal
four-point spread with less than a

minute to go. But the Panthers ran out the clock with a deliberate and
effective stall and thus took the win.

The quality of roundball displayed was impressive.

Wilson, the

game’s most valuable player, couldn't miss a shot, while Jones gave the
fans their money’s worth with skyrocketing jumps and unchallenged

tip-ins.

Both the Steelers (Harris, L.C. Greenwood, Gordon Gravelle, Steve
Davis, Steve F urness, Mungo Gaines, Gerry Mullins, to name a few) and
the Panthers (Wilson, Jones, Dorsett, Holloway, Willie Taylor, Jerry
Sylvestri, Jim Cramer, John Pelusi, Randy Reutershan, Ed Wilamowski
and Jim Corbett) made it a ‘ ‘Super Sunday” for sports fans at Chartiers

“After the first couple weeks this
season, a couple of the guys came
up to me and said they didn't know
that they had joined the Marines,"
DeStout added with a laugh. “But
we told them this was the year we
were going to do it. Larry Waymon
(Pitt assistant coach) followed me
up on this all the way and pushed
the players. He pushed everything
I really wanted and really helped
me."

Another effect of DeStout’s
persistence will soon be felt by the
Panthers. One of his main goals
has been an expanded schedule for
the club and this year he has it.

“This season," DeStout Said.
“we have 40 games, or twice as
‘many as last year. I think the guys
are behind me, too. I just told them
this is the time to give Pitt a name
in baseball and a lot of the guys
have followed. I'd say the whole
team is behind me."

DeStout is hoping this self-
imposed team unity will follow the
Panthers to California this week
where they will compete in the
University of California at
Riverside National Intercollegiate
Baseball Tournament against some
of the biggest names in NCAA
baseball.

But DeStout, apparently not

inclined to have his conﬁdence
shattered no matter how tough the

have a good shot at bringing home
the championship today.

vital in this tournament since head
coach Bobby Lewis will not make
the trip with the team. Lewis
remains hospitalized indeﬁnitely
while recuperating frorri a stomach‘
operation. But DeStout welcomes

the added ‘responsibilities Lewis?‘

absence brings.

"Larry (Waymon) sort of told me
that it's just me and him and we
gotta do it," DeStout said. “He
handed me a lot of responsibility."

To a guy who nearly triumphed
over a bear in wrestling match, the
responsibility doesn’t bother De-
Stout a bit.

- North Carolina,’MaIrquette 
Clash in NCAA Title Bout

ATLANTA (AP)—Fifth-ranked
North Carolina and No. 7 Mar-
quette, at last playing its final
game under fiery Coach Al

, McGuire, collide Monday night for

college basketball’s biggest prize-
the NCAA championship.

Both teams overcame adversity
during the season to reach this
point, where one will present a
veteran coach with his first national
title ever.

The tipoff is set for 8:15 p.m.
EST before a sellout crowd of about
16,000 in The Omni plus a national
television NBC audience. ,

Marquette has reeled off nine

consecutive victories since snap-
ping a three-game losing streak
that followed McGuire's retirement
announcement.

North Carolina, meanwhile has
overcome injuries to key personnel
in building a 15-game winning
streak to move within one triumph
of handing Coach Dean Smith his
ﬁrst NCAA championship.

Each survived rugged semiﬁnal
competition Saturday when Mar-
quette trimmed unheralded North
Carolina-Charleotte 51-49 on Je-
rome Whitehead’s basket at the
buzzer and the Tar Heels held off a
furious closing charge to edge No.
4 Nevada-Las Vegas 84-83.
