Business Review
Depicts March
Banking Crisis

The latest Pittsburgh Business

Review, published monthly by the
University's Bureau of Business
iesearch, reflects local develop-
ments produced by the bankii g
crisis of early March. Normal
seasonal increases in‘ February
were out sharply throughout
March.

Featured in the Review is an
article on the banking and mone-
tary crisis. Analyzing the crisis
thoroughly, the staff members
stress problems directly connect-
ed with the banks together with
the strain originating from the
excessive demand for currency
and gold. ‘

Iron and steel production, Pitts- .
burgh’s basic function, fell off
sharply during March. Chief con-
tributing factor in this curtail-
ment was the complete cessation
of automobile steel orders which
followed the banking moratorium
in the entire State of Michigan.
As banking trouble increased, all
new steelorders virtually ceased.

Miscellaneous items, including
real -estate activity, department-
store trade, and employment also
reflected the general downward
trend.

Exchange Cap-
Gown Tickets
TA-pril 10And11

Use De Sota Street Booths
Again; Inaugurate New
Low Rate System

Eliminate Matinee

_ Student ticket exchange for the
ffortlicomhing Cap and Gown show,
5“All to the Point,” will take place
Monday and Tuesday, April 10 and 11,
from 4:30 to 6:30 o'clock. according
to an announcement made ‘today by
§Wa.lter J. Rome," assistant dean of
,,men,an_d graduate manager of the Cap
and Gown Club.
, The De Sota street ticket booths,
adjacent to the Activities ,, Building,
will again be used for the exchange
of activity book coupons for Nixon
theater reserved seat tickets. 2

. Elimination of the customary Satur-
day matinee and establishment of spe-
-cial price concessions to students de-
siring to obtain extra tickets were

, also revealed by Mr. Rome in his an-

nouncement.

No student books will be honored
for Monday night tickets, the entire
performance and house for that night
being sponsored by the Civic Club of
Allegheny County. ' _

Under the new system of exchange,
any student may obtain two orchestra
or ﬁrstbalcony admissions upon pre-
sontation of his activity book and one
additional. The special price
will apply to only one extra ticket,
witlrthe regular price being charged
for additional extra seats.

/In previous years, Mr. Rome point-
ed out, students who wished to pur-
chase an extra orchestra seat were re-
quired to pay the established price of
$2.50. He stressed the fact that the
new arrangements make possible a
saving of $1.50 under that charged
last year for the same seats.

“Cap and Gown is pleased to an--
nounce this special price concession
to students,” observed Mr. Rome.
“Frequently, students have wanted to
take friends or other members of
their family to a Ca.p and Gown show
but felt they were unable to pay the
established price for the second
ticket. Recognizing present ﬁnancial
difﬁculties and endeavoring to accom-
modate the student body, Cap and
Gown has, therefore, decided to
charge only half price for one extra
downstairs scat. We sincerely be-
lieve that many students will be
eager to take advantage of this es-
pecially low rate.”

Although no deﬁnite statement as
to the reason for eliminating the mat-
inee performance was given, it was
inferred that the action was taken be-
cause of economic conditions. It was
said by Mr. Rome that-the matinee
had been operated at a loss during
the past few years.

Students Injured On Trip
To State Week-End Party

————

 

While motoring to State College
for a weekend house party. three
Pit_tsb.urgh couples, including four
Pitt students." met with an accident
near Johnstown Friday night when
their car skidded into a ditch.

Three of the students, Richard

Hughes, Bus. Ad. '35‘; Alfred Steinau,
Eng. '36, and Jean Schmidt, Col. '34,
were among the injured. They suffer-
ed minor bruises which were treated
at a Johnstown hospital. The fourth,
William I-Ialkeyard, Bus. Ad. ’33, es-
caped injury.
,;'..Grace Fournier and Ruth Nichols.
Pittsburgh. were the most seriously
injured. They suffered lacerations
and were conﬁned to the hospital for
the night.

¢the University. .

The latter restriction prevents all
student publications from accepting
beer advertising for use on or after
Friday, and will aﬁect the Pitt News,
Panther, Owl, and school Publications
such as Dental Rays, the Downtowner
and publications of the Junior Col-
leges.

Letters setting forth the action taken
by the Eixecutive Committee were
sent yesterday to the deans of all
sc.hools and administrative officers by
Dr, Samuel B. Linhart, secretary of
the University, requesting their co-
operation in carrying out the rules
and in bringing about the cooperation
of student organizations and activi-
ties. » _,

The rules adopted by the trustee
Friday are as follows:

1. Beer and wine shall not be sold

or used on any property of the
University, this rule to apply not
only to property owned by the
University, but to any property
leased or occupied by the Uni-
versity.
There shall be no advertising of
beer, wine or liquor of any kind
in any University publications.
this to include the Pitt News,
Panther, Owl, and publications of
schools of the University, such
as Dental Rays, Pitt Downtowner
and publications issued from the
Junior Colleges.
There shall be no use or sale of
beer, wine, or liquor of any kind
at meetings or social functions
held under the auspices of rec-
ognized University activities or
organizations, whether upon Uni-
versity property or elsewhere.

The rulings automatically prohibit

the sale or use of beer and wine at all

student dances, parties and meetings,
whether held on or off campus, and
imply that the legalized beverages
will not be served by the University

Cafeteria or by any of the fraternities

chartered at the University. ,
The action taken by the trustees

followed in the wake of similar re-

strictions placed on the sale and use
of beer and wine at Penn State, the

University of Pennsylvania and Lafay-

ette. -. A
In effect, the rulings are a restate-

ment of restrictions enforced by the
University and by the social fratern-
ities themselves before p«rol1ibition,
one administrative officer pointed out
today. Before Federal prohibition,
he said, student publications were not
permitted to carry any liquor adver-
tising, vmen’s social fraternities were
governed by strict organization and
house rulings and the use of liquor
was forbidden at all University social
functions.

Five Panther
Entries Place

Set Mile Relay Record At
Chicago Meet

 

Both Dame Fortune-\ and Miss F01‘-
tune accompanied the Pitt track
team as it competed in the Armor
'l‘ecl1 relay and track meet at Chi-
cago last Saturday. All ﬁve of Pitt's
entries ﬁgured in the scoring.

Five new meet records were set
and the home boys were responsible
for one of them, when Bill Keller,
anchor man, flashed across the ﬁnish
line well ahead of the pack in the
University one-mile relay. The Pitt
relay a§rz::1'ega.t.iou, composed of Kiger,
.VIcDona.ld, \Va.tkins, and Keller out-
ran a fast Micliigaii State team to
ﬁnish in the remarkable time of
3223.5. The old mark of 3225.1 was
set by Indiana last year.

Albright, carrying the Panther col-
ors in the mile run, finished third to
Illinois and ‘.\Iichiga.n State rivals.

Kellar ran into a piece of tough
luck when he was disqualiﬁed after
winning the 44-O-yard dash. The Pitt
star had run a. beautiful race to come
out ahead of a. fast ﬁeld, but he step-
ped out of his lane near the end of
tlie dash and was ruled out by the
‘judges. V l

of the sought—for solutions of the _organization’s election problems.
At least a dozen petition forms had been taken out Monday by as

Not all the evils inherent in’ a. closed fraternal order can be
eliminated by a system of open nominations. There is no guarantee

that the new practice will prove

to be an effective corrective inﬂu-

ence against internal politics, as alleged concerning past Druid elec-
tions. It does, however, give. the politically unaﬂiliatcd man-—and

this usually means the fraternally

to have his name at least brought

unafﬁliated man—-an opportunity
up for consideration.

Thus it is made a little more difﬁcult for the voting membership
to plead a lack. of candidates when called to answer for a possible

failure to recognize worthy men.

‘ Movies in General ,_

Tliere have been thrilling movies
before. There have been dynamic
movies before. In fact, there have
been no movies within the memory
of man that have not been advertised
as both dynamic and thrilling, with the
possible exception of the Laurel and
Hardy comedies which have been
screa.min,g‘ly funny. But “Gabriel
Over the ‘White House" proposes to
be something different. It is politic-
ally prophetic, and in times like these
you might as well put an exclamation
point after a phrase like that

In 8. Word, it pro-fascist. It

:sm.nes unconstitutional authority and
gmceedg to‘wipe up grangsters, inter-
uationaldiplomats, and employers who
refuse to do their stint in the “Share
Vvork" drives.

To the showmansliip ability of the
1'»-Ietro-Goldwyn-Mayer officials, it.
must be admitted that nothing ap-
peals so much to the popular mind
when it comes to politics as a dictator.
Besides the man who rules with a
hand of iron, an ordinary political ﬁg-
ure has about as much appeal as a
dish of cold hominyy The dictator
struts, condemns with vigor,’ for-
gives with mercy, and commands. To
men the dictator appeals because he
is thepman they dream of being. To
women the dictator appeals because
he is the man they dream being
with.

Hero Psychology

You_couidn'1., for instance, have a
director of the Interstate ;Commercc_
Commission -‘or a, ,Federal Reserve
Agent‘ wi_th sex appeal, although he
might."be' a. great hero in .a great
crisis. You could even make your
hero a. youthful memb-er of the Tariff
Commission who went into the execu-
tive oitioes and told the President and
the Cabinet the bald truth about.
tariff lobbying, and still your picture
would be‘ a. dud. Unless your hero
got himself into a. jam with one of
those. -women-..wl1o are photographed
on Malibu beach, the shop-girls and
clerks would stay away in droves.

It is a strange feature of human na-,
ture, but it is an evident one. Musso-§

lini and his -Black Shirts gave castor .

oil in quarts to their enemies, as
cruel an ‘act as anytlnng a.mad-Czar
ever thought of. Gifford Pinchot and
his men sponsored a Giant Power
Survey to whose documents writers
on public utilities still refer as au-
thoritative. And which man is the
greater hero? How much appeal is
there in an electric light bill, even an
agreeably low one .
“Gabriel Over the White House,” in
picture..or book-...-fo'rm,..-plays. to a good”
box office tune _on these strings of
human emotions. A reviewer whose
popularity is a.'.-fair indication of what
Pittsburghers usually think says that
the picture is “stirring to the sur-
prised hearts of Americans!” Fur-
ther, this reviewer offers that the
picture. '.‘-must be seen as a gesture -01’;

good citizenship alone.” This, no
doubt, because of its “almost sacred
authenticity.”

Mob Likings

No doubt people like to see things
being done quickly and efficiently.
The current enthusiasm over Presi-
dent Roosevelt is evidence enough of
that. One feature of this cinematic
pipe-dream which probably ‘had the
patrons standing on their chairs was
the mythical President’s attack on
the gangsters with tanks. That is so
much more romantic than conviction
for income tax evasion.

I would not suggest that there is
anything immediately dangerous in
such ideas. _ Fortuziatcly for those of
us who would like to get aifew years
«extension on our trial of democracy,
the American people are too lacking in
"political energy to rally to areal clic-
tator. They lament the lack of jus-
tice; they carp over known and un-
known graft without rlnderstaiicling
the inevitability of it; but, thank
Heaven, they never do much about it.
On occasion they do elect a. good man
to office. And ,I hope they continue
to conﬁne their rash acts to that nar-
row sphere.

Democracy is seeing sore days now.
But contemporary politics no more
prove it a failure than does the Kid-
dies’ Hour prove radio a vicious in-
vention. Democracy brokn down in
Gerznany befcause of erternal condi-
tions which Germans could not rem-
edy. Mussolini was able to squelch
it in Italy because his first lieutenant
was illiteracy. In the United States
at present, we are witnessing a bril-
liant__demonst1-ation of democracy
working in a crisis. It is true that it
took an‘ unusual man to make it
work. ‘But. democracy has a. faculty
for producing unusual men.

Dictatorship can only appeal to very
young minds. Its first assumption is
