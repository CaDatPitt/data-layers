by Vote of 577 to 51 in Six

PETITIONS ARE NOW DUE.

Candidates Must Have Signed
Nominations in Saturday-
Constitutional Convention to
Hold Next Wednesday’s Elec-
tion.

Q With the almost unanimous adop-
tion of the new constitution as ﬁnally
reported by the constitutional fon-
vention, the former system of gov-
ernment has passed away, and the
third Wednesday in May, falling next
week upon the nineteenth, becomes the
annual Spring election day. .

The results of last Week's elections
which were held in six of the on-
campus schools by the retiring school
senates are tabulated below:

In the School of Medicine owing to
the inability of the student senate to
get the student body together at any
one time, an election could not be held
simultaneously with those in the oth-
er schools. -It is probable that a vote
will be taken upon the constitution
this week. However, as the enrol-
ment of the Medical school is but
103 classiﬁed students, such vote
could have no possible effect upon the
result of the general election, the
necessary two-thirds majority being
far surpassed in either case. The ratio
of favorable votes in the six schools
to combined non-favorable and condi-
tional was more than eleven to one.
Figuring upon a basis of the regular-
ly classiﬁed students in the six
schools, exclusive of those in the third
and fourth years of the combined
College and Medical course, the per-
centage of the gualiﬁed electors vot-
ing at the election was approximately
.48 which, relatively speaking, is high,
when compared with the vote in the
last general’ election for, cheerleader.

The arrangements for the first elec-
tion under the new constitution are
proceeding rapidly, and in accordance

V with the new rules, the various candi-

dates for office are now busy pre-
paring‘ their petitions. Nomination
petitions must be signed by ﬁve prop-
erly qualiﬁed voters, and placed in
the hands of some member of the
constitutional convention or of their
appointees before Saturday, May 15,

SPEAKER TALKS
0N MINIMUM
WAEE

ADOPTED“ BY TEN STATES.

President of University of South
Dakota is Present at Assem-
bly; Exercises Opened by
Honorary « Alumnus.

At the University assembly last
Friday morning, “The Minimum Wage
Law” was the subject of the address
given by Mrs. Florence Kelly of New
York. Mrs.‘ Kelly is ‘General Secre-
tary of the National Consumers’
League, and has spent many years in
the study of the wage question, dur-
ing which period she has conducted in-
vestigations of the various working
conditions in many parts of the civ-
ilized world.

Mrs. Kelly said in part:

“The new law was first adopted by
Oregon, which established an indus-
trial welfare commission, whose duty
itw as to inquire into all working con-
ditions. It was found as the result of
the investigation that no adults could
live in Portland on an income of less
than ten dollars a week. After long
litigation, the Supreme Court of Ore-
gon upheld the new law. When the
Federal Supreme Court passes upon
the constitutionality of the new sys-
tem, it will mean much to the labor-
ers of the country.” -

“After the abolition of slavery in

this country, we went to the Orient
for cheap labor, brought here forcibly
in many cases. When this was stop-
ped, substitutes were sought for, and
these were found in little children,
employed at a wage of ten or ﬁfteen
cents a day. For thirty years, a
movement has endeavored to stop this
brutal practice. It was found that the
wage of the parent was too small to
support even a small family in health-
and frugal decency.”
The exercises of the‘ morning were
opened by Dr. S. G. Wilson of Tabriz,
Persia, an honorary alumnus of the
University. Another honored guest
was Dr. Robert Lincoln Slagle, Presi-
dent of the University of South
Dakota. ’

WELL KNOWN SPEAKER
Is SEBUi@_ av CLUB

For the last meeting of the Social-
ist‘Study club the members have se-
cured as a speaker, Mrs. Gertrude B.
Fuller. Mrs. Fuller needs no intro-
duction to the residents of Pittsburgh
as she not only lives here but has
made many addresses before local
audiences; and over the State of Penn-
sylvania at large.

These certiﬁed blanks must reach-

MRS. GERTRUDE B. FULLER
‘Just what Mrs. Fuller will take as

her subject is not known but in all

probability it will be along social lines
and will be especially interesting to
the girls who are invited to be pres-
ent at this meeting.

The club expects a large attendance
for this meeting which is to be held
in 30.4 State hall, on Monday, May 17,
at 11:30 a. In.

On Monday, May 24, the club will
hold its annual luncheon at the Hotel
Schenley at which time the members
will elect oﬁicers for the coming year.

nuns PEHFEGTING
SEMESTER SYSTEM

On recommendation of the faculty
committee the Board of Deans has de-
termined the number of credits to be
given for the subjects completed by
the double semester system. When
the new plan was adopted by the
Trustees the question of the distribu-
tion of thetcredits was left for furth-

 

« er consideration. .

I The new plan calls for two ‘semest-
ers of 16 weeks each, and a summer
term of eight weeks. For a full
semester’s work in one subject three
credits will be given and for a.._.,sum-
mer term’s work one. and one-half
credits will be allowed.

This plan will apply to all the
undergraduate schools of the Univer-
sity except the Sophomores and Jun-
iors in the School of Engineering who
are doing cooperative work. The co-
operative work requires three months
time and the semester would be lost
entirely to that student if some other
‘measures were not adopted.

‘The plan «in use for cooperative
work used at the present term has
been so effective that other leading
universities have‘ adopted it. Upon
recommendation of the Faculty of the
Engineering school that thepresent
system be used in that department in

.the sophomore and junior year, the

Board‘ of Deans at once adopted that
measure.

Two-thirds of the credit grades
already obtained by students in the
University will be credited in the new
system, and the number of credits re-
quired for graduation will be reduced.

MUSICAL BLUB
CONCERT A
,   SUQIIESS -

P R O G R A M A SURPRISE.

Annual Home Event Marked by
Unique Features.

Despite a combination of unfavor-
able circumstances which seemed con-
spiring against the" occasion, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Musical clubs
achieved a distinct success last Fri-
day evening in Carnegie Music hall,
at their annual home concert. -1!
Q The _concert itself was very favor-
ably received by its hearers, and the
impression generally produced was
that it was the best home concert the
clubs have given for several years.

I During the ﬁrst half, the glee club

and quartet men seemed slightly be-
low par, but in the latter part of the
program the vocalists warmed up in
great shape, encouraged by the grow-
ingly enthusiastic audience. Prompt-
ly at 8:30, the Glee club appeared on
the -platform under the direction of
their student leader, Russel H. Kirk,
Dent. ’15, with Elton S. Warner, Med.
’18 at the piano, for their opening
number, “Estudiantina.” The Man-
dolin club folowed with a snappy in-
strumental bit, the “Northern Lights
Overture,” and after which J. A.
Thompson, Econ. ’17, the clubs’ reader,
made his evening’s debut with his
thrilling narrative of “The Boy Ora-
tor of Zapata City.” “Floating Mid
the Lilies,” by the Glee clvub, elicited
warm applause for its delicate tone
shading and harmony. The Varsity
quartet composed of Scott, Franklin,
Pollock and Elder, began a series of
triumphs‘ with the popular Carrie
Jacobs Bond song, “Somewhere a
Voice is Calling,” and were forced to
respond to double encores. The Man-
dolin club, with its student leader,
Floyd A. Franklin, Engr. ’16, taking
both a vocal and instrumental solo
part, made a hit with “L’Amour Tient
a Pen de Chose,” and the Glee club
en-ded the ﬁrst half of the program
with a vocal setting of Rubinstein’s
“Melody in F,” called “Voices of the
Woods.”

After the customary intermission,
during which the audience promen-
aded in the foyer, the Glee club open-
ed up again with “College Days.”
Jack Thompson convvulsed the crowd
with his impersonation of a- Dutch
senator. _ He encored with “How Ruby
Played” and other dialect pieces. The
quartet won more honors with their
beautiful rendition of an old negro
“spiritual,” and generously answered
the insistent demand for “more.”
“Romeo and Juliet,” with the roles of
hero and heroine ﬁlled respectively by
Messrs. Scott and Pollock, was one of
the most striking hits of the evening.
The "club responded with some clever
parodies on “Tipperary,” based on
themes of local color. “Indian
Sagwa” was the title of one of the
Mandolin club’s best numbers. Rus-
sel ‘Kirk then sang Pinsuti’s “Bedouin
Love Song” with excellent voice-qual-
ity and expression. The program
closed with “Alma Mater,” George
Baird’s University hymn, by the com-
bined clubs, with the audience stand-
mg. .

ject was “The Message of Leaders to
College Men.” Mr. Hall was tied for
second place on points but lost on
general percentage. The ﬁrst prize
of $50 was taken by an Ohio Wesley-
can man, Glenn R. Philips, while the
second prize of $25 was won by _L. V.
Collings of Colgate.

This organization includes Colgate,
Allegheny, Pitt, Wooster, and Ohio
Wesleyan. It has done much to stim-
ulate oratorical work in the several
institutions.

Mr. Hall was elected secretary and
treasurer of the League for the en-
suing year. L; V. Collings of,.Colgate
is President. The contest will ‘be held

ASSISTANT REGISTRAR
URGES COOPERATION.

“It’s the" chance to show your school
loyalty and to do a service to your
Alma- Mater,” says the assistant reg-

Carlton G. Ketchum, assistant reg-
istrar urges_ you if you know of stud-
ents who plan to take university

in which they are interested, to Gil-
bert Quick, Department of School Re-
lations. .

. HAIL, BROTHER PEN-PUSHERS!

—_—__.._—

’Welcomes are such common ex-
cuses for triteness that we almost hes-
itate to make our bow to the delegates
of the Middle Atlantic association of
College and High School Editors who
will be visiting us Friday and Satur-
day of this week’ for their fourth
annual conference. But in both our
capacities of hosts and fellow-journal-
ists, we are mighty glad to have them
with us again. The potentialities
bound up in a. conference of this kind
are inexhaustible. It rests with every
attendant to appropriate as much or
as little of value as he will. Our
guests are the leaders of the college
and school press of Pennsylvania,
Ohio- and West Virginia, and as such
they are no mean men.

College journalism is no longer in
the apologetic stage. We have long
since disproved the greeleyism that
theoretical training before practical,
in the ﬁeld of newspaper work, is an
unfeasible thing. And we have like-
wise ﬁrmly established the truth that
the practical ‘can be gained side by
side with the theoretical in the work
of putting out a successful college
publication. In the United States to-
day, upwards of thirty colleges and
universities publish daily newspapers,
while robably ﬁve times that num-
ber res rict their activity to the week-
ly or semi-weekly ﬁeld. The training
that the members of their staffs re-
-‘ceive in the pursuit of their duties is
never time lost, and many such men
not actively engaged in journalism to-
day still count their experience as the
most _valuable education which they
have received, in or out of college.
This is true in a higher degree of
college journalism than of any other
student activity. And the college
press need not hang its head for de-
ﬁciency in any of the prime quali-
ties of the bestjournalistic practice.
In ‘accuracy, proportion, enterprise,
typography and makeup, literary
standard, ethical tone, and public
service, the college newspaper reﬂects
the spirit of the metropolitan lead-
ers.

Dean Walter Williams of the
University of Missouri School of
Journalism, our conference guest of
honor, who will speak to us Friday
evening on “The World’s Journalism,”
will probably tell us much which he
has already incorporated in a mono-
graph in the University of Missouri
bulletin. Among his ﬁndings and con-
clusions upon his recent trip around
the globe, in which he had opportuni-
ty to examine at ﬁrst hand the journ-
alism of countries, are these prophetic
words: “The new journalism * * will
be more and more a social institu-
tion directed by men of sound train-
ing, large experience, broad vision and
high courage, in the interest of
society. Despite many and important
exceptions, this is the present tenden-
cy of the world's journalism.”

‘It is in this renaissance of the writ-

ten word, this golden age of scribb-

lers, when the editor and the reporter

, shall indeed be mightier than the war-

rior and the prince, that the college
journalist may share. His is an in-
yitation to mold the minds of the com-
ing generation of the nation's aristo-

 RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT.

The decisive majority returned last
week for the new constitution is not

, to be interpreted as either a vindica-
, tion

of any man or group of
men. It is simply the culmination of
a gradual process of fermentation in

gthe student body which has lead to
, the inevitable, and as some brand it,
E.-revolutionary effort at progress. That
a percentage as large as did, should

take the interest necessary to vote on
the proposition, is at least a token
that the time was ripe for revision.

 Whatever the fate of the new’system,

 

=  the new constitution as

» there is the satisfaction of knowing
-that government under the new organ
* can scacely be more negligible or un-

achieving than during the past three
months. '
Standing: off now, and taking a
squint at the present proposition, from
all angles, it can hardly fail to strike

the man up a tree, that the proper

course for every Pitt student is to

cise the self-control necessary to re-

 

strenuously and ‘ intelligently as he
knows how. The process ‘ which ‘was
necessary to attainment of the present
situation was, as every one knows,
fraught with personalities and partis-
anship. We’ve all (or those of us who
were sufficiently concerned) been
scrapping like sam hill over issues
which have been obscured or distort-
ed. Now its time to hold a political
love feast and lubricate the wheels
of government with a little milk of
human kindness.

The immediate points to be taken
cognizance of are the ﬁrst regular
Spring elections of a week from ‘to-
day, and their attendant circumstanc-
es. Saturday is the ﬁnal day set for
handing in nomination petitions, and
it is up to the office-seekers to meet
the requirements promptly in this re-
spect, in order that proper publicity
can be given to the candidates, and
the printed ballot system be given a
thorough try-out. If the ﬁrst elec-
tion can be handled with a minimum
of difficulty, and a body of interested
and able men put into office, the rest
will be smooth sailing.

A “STUDENT” ACTIVITY.

Last Friday’s concert marked the
close of the most successful season
the Pitt Musical clubs have experi-
enced in many years. And it was not
accidental success, but one laid upon
deep foundations, one which had genu-
ine causes, and one which deserved
every ounce of encouragement and
support it received and much more,
from whatever source.

This year has seen the clubs put on
a ﬁrm ﬁnancial basis. The standing
of the organization with the members
of the advisory committee on student
activities is such that -a grant of
money from the activities fund is al-
ways- forthcoming, without a mo-
ment’s hesitation. More trips have
been taken this year and more con-
certs given than in any year during
the past three. The members of the
clubs are picked men, all bona ﬁde
students, who are up in their work and
have passed eligibility requirements
more strict than those of the Univer-
sity athletes. The quality of the con-
certs they have given has at least
been up to the standard of former
years. Yet all this has been accomp-
lished by student managers and stu-
dent leaders, something which had
been considered heretofore impossible.
It is only fair to state that Manager
Haines has not and will not receive
for his services this year, one cent
beyond actual expenses. .

The dealings of the club with others,
whether students, public, or business
men, have been such as to establish
unlimited credit and conﬁdence._ No
longer do the ﬁrms of Pittsburgh shy
when the Musical clubs seek business
relations with them. The whole ob-
ject of the clubs has been to serve
their constituency and they have suc-
ceeded admirably in carrying out this
policy. For the ﬁrst time in Univer-
sity history, the common student has
gotten an equal chance with every-
body else at the seats in Carnegie
Hall. Not a patroness, fraternity, or
favored friend or intimate of the man-
agement has been allowed access to
the seats before the students at large.
Even the members of the club them-
selves were compelled to stand in line
with the rest of humanity and submit
to the democratic rule of “ﬁrst come,
ﬁrst served.” We have heard no com-
plaints but only words of praise for
the efficient and satisfactory way in
whieh the last sale was handled.

All these things are as they should
be. A student activity, by its very
name, should be run of, by, and for
the students. The pro ress which the
Musical clubs have ma e this year has
been due to one or two main causes.
The clubs now have a working consti-
tution which prescribes strict eligi-
bility and competitive rules, which
leave room for all possible exigencies
of expansion. But probably the big-
gest single factor in the clubs’ suc-
cess has been the advice and assist-
ance of Faculty Advisor Louis J.
Heath, who has given unstintingly of
his time and energy to the interests
of the organization, has accompanied
the clubs on all trips, has stood be-
tween them and the “men higher up,”
when such mediation was necessary,
and given the clubs by his own rela-
tion to them the respect and support
of those officials. This is a record to
be proud of. We wish we had more
Heaths and more Musical clubs. They.
have contributed a long step toward
the millennium of student activities in
this institution.

UPHOLDING HIS ARMS.

 

If the American people were com-
posed exclusively of W. Sundays and
T. Roosevelts, and other hot-headed
gentlemen of their ilk, prone to rush
into print with vitriolic philippics,
even upon so great provocation as that
of the Lusitania disaster, the nation
would long since have been plunged
into war with Mexico, or Japan, or
Germany or Great Britain, or some
other offender against our “national
honor.” The “Billys” and “Teddys”
are so inured to the hardships of pub-
licity that it has becomesecond nature
to them. But they are not the heads
who bear the responsibility of steer-
ing the ship of state through the
dangerous waters which are swirling
around it, and well that they are not.
We daresay that there is not an Am-
erican citizen so calloused that emo-
tions of pity or indignation have not
surged in his breast during the past
week, but it is no time to give vent
to such feelings, and such expressions
are not in harmony with the evident
duty of us all to preserve the spirit as
well as the strict letter of the Presi-
dent’s proclamation of neutrality and
his public utterances on the subject.

The American press has teemed with
sane and splendid editorials in similar
strain since Friday's catastrophe,
none more so than the Pittsburgh Dis-
patch’s deliverance of Saturday morn-
ing, entitled “Stand by the President.”
And that is just what we are all call-
ed upon to do in this present crisis.
Whatever our sympathies or our an-
cestry, we are now ﬁrst of all Amer-
icans, and it is to America that we
owe our allegiance, and to her Presi-
dent, as our accredited representative
that we owe our calm, silent and stead-
fast support. We can and must exer-

_(Editors Note-—The following re-
view was prepared by the manage-
ment of the Musical clubs.)

 

The striking success achieved by
the Musical clubs of the University
in their Home Concert last Friday
evening was but a ﬁtting close for the
most notable year in their history.

Many radical departures were made
from the old order of established
things, and the results have justiﬁed
the change. .Under a new manage-
management, a new constitution, a
new system of organization, and,
most important of all, a new concep-
tion of the character of the activity
on the part of the members, the Mus-
ical clubs have attained a point where
they have ceased to be a mere sing-
ing association, and have beciomeua
vital fellowship, truly typical of the
spirit of old Pitt.

This change is due chieﬂy to the
efforts of Prof. L. J. Heath, the faculty
adviser of the clubs. When he ac-
cepted the position his aim was to
make of this organization the livest
and most successful .club in school.
His efforts were constant and untiring
and the results demonstrate their
value. Both the Musical clubs and the
University owe a great deal to Mr.
Heath for his work.

The personnel of the managing staff,
of the officers, and of the instructors
should not be ignored when ﬁxing the
credit for the progress of the clubs.
Those at the head of affairs during
the past season were men who worked
hard for the success of the activity
and the number of concert dates se-
cured speaks well for Manager A. S.
Haines and his assistants, R. W.
Haines and W. W. Tanney. It is to"
these men that we owe the ﬁnal suc-
cess of the clubs. When Manager
Haines took over the administration
of the clubs last fall he was at once
forced to bend his efforts toward
wiping out a debt of almost seven
hundred dollars which had been in-_
curred previous to last year. Due to
his capability this debt has been dis-
charged, and the clubs are now some-
what ahead of the game. The man-
ager has worked hard to bring this
about, and the present prosperous
condition of the clubs is his reward.

The officers have displayed an ac-
tive interest, and have been of great
assistance to Mr. Heath in his cam-
paign for better spirit in this stu-
dent activity. H. C. Scott. Dent.
’15, the President, has worked through-
out the season with his customary
“pep,” and he has succeeded in infus-
ing much enthusiasm into the mem-
bers. You all know what Scott’s brand
of spirit is like. J. M. Thorne, Eng.
’16, and Frank Rome, Econ. ’15, the
Vice President and the-‘Secretary,
have been back of him every minute.
And Dean Fetterman has of course

een guarding the shekels. There is
no dead wood to b_e_found among the
officers. 0

As to the quality of music which the
clubs have offered there is no need of
discussion here. The number of-con-
certs given this year and the satis-
faction which all,the audiences have
displayed’ are ample testimony. It is
a notable fact that both the Mandolin
and the Glee club have been under
student direction, a radical departure
from the practise of former years. But
the quality of work has not suffered
by the change.

Russel Kirk has made the Glee
club into an organism that is respons-
ive to his control. The excellence of
his training was well shown in the
Home’ concert by the splendid blend-
ing of voices. L. Guy Garrett, was in
direct charge of the Mandolin club,
with Floyd Franklin as his student
assistant. Both these men deserve
much credit for their faithful work,
and the present success of the Mando-
in club has been ultimately due to
their efforts.

The Musical clubs have had an un-
lusually full season. They have given
fourteen concerts in all, six in Pitts-
burgh, and eight in other towns and
cities in Western Pennsylvania. They
have taken four long trips, represent-
ing the University in -Erie, Wilkins-
burg, Cumberland, Somerset, Latrobe,
Uniontown, Wilmerding, and Belle-
And everywhere they have ap-

The ﬁrst appearance of the present

clubs was at the Pitt-State Concert,
last Noizember.

The body that repre-
sented Pitt on that occasion was not

.the trained and selected organization

it is today, for the ﬁnal trials are not
held until after this concert. The Glee
club was therefore much larger than
it is now, and the voices were not all
of the best quality, as all the men
who were trying out for the club
were permitted to sing. The ﬁnal
trials in the Glee club were held the
2nd week of December, and all un-
promising ‘material weeded out. New
music was taken up, the members were

dence is in, as the President himself
is doing, and when he announces the
policy of the ggvernment in the case,
we must lead him to feel that the Am-
erican people stand as a unit behind
him, ﬁrm in the belief that the results
will justify our trust.

And what part can we as American
university men and women play in the
upholding of the President’s hands?
We are no less bound by the necessity
of neutrality than are the working-
men, the farmers, the men of affairs,
the educators, the press, the pulpit, or
the bar of the nation. If college‘ is a
place to learn mastery of self, here
is a supreme opportunity. If educa-
tion means cosmopolitanism and not
factionalism, tolerance without loss of
nationality, now is the time to . put
such theory to the test. In the class-
rooms and on the campus are the best
places not to discuss the war and its
attendant horrors. We may hold to-
our individual opinions as we will-—
no one can help or be blamed for them
—but the best interests of humanity

serve our judgment until all the evi-‘

 

     
   
 

demand that “we. keep a check-rein .on
our tongues. . V »- _  ‘~

faithful _in their attendance at re-
hearsaflf and- the clubs were in the
best 0 condition for their trip to Cum-
berland and Somerset on the thirtieth
and- thirty-ﬁrst of December.

The clubs did nobly by opening the
New Year in Somerset in the most ap-
proved fashion. They sang in the
lobby of the hotel, and the proprietor
immediately gave up his title and as-
sured them that they owned the place.

Somerset had a municipal Christ-
mas tree, just like a real city, so the
fellows gathered around the tree and
cut loose.

During '0 the next two months the
clubs gave two small concerts, one at
Christ Church, Pittsburgh, on Janu-
ary twenty-second, and the other at
Wilmerding, on February twelfth. On
the nineteenth of February the sec-
ond trip was taken, and an opportuni-
ty given the people of Latrobe to hear
the best. While this was not so ex-
citing as the former trip, yet the fel-
Iows all seemed to have a good time.
A dance was given for the clubs after
the concert, and no Pitt men were to
be found suffering from corns or
rheumatism.

March was a particularly good
month for the Musical clubs. It was
opened auspiciously by the concert in
Bellevue on the ﬁfth, where the men
were entertained by a dance after the
concert. And even if the orchestra
did fail to show up and Canan did
have to furnish the music for the
“merry wrestle” it was a ﬁne dance.
But the real affair came the next Fri-
day when a concert was given at the
Pennsylvania College for Women. You
can believe that the fellows never
looked ﬁner and never sang better
than they did on March twelfth.‘ The
young ladies seemed to bewell pleas-
ed with our handsome representatives,
for they replied with a fetching par-
ody on one of Gus Schnabel’s famous
songs, in which they transferred their
allegience from “the lad in the uni-
form” to “the boys of the Pitt Glee
Club.”

Our musicians invaded new terri-
tory on the twenty-sixth of March
when they travelled to Erie. Erie re-
ceived them with open arms, as is her
custom. The concert came off in good
shape before a well ﬁlled house, and
the fellows were entertained over
night at the homes of “the leading
young ladies of the city,” as it was
expressed in the guarantee. On the
return, the freshmen of the party
demonstrated at least one claim to
the right to exist when they were

ut by the upper-classmen to handling
aggage.

April was a rather slow month in
comparison with those preceding. Two
city concerts were given, one at the
Holmes School, on April eighth, and
the other at Sterrett School, on the
sixteenth. The audience at Sterrett
was somewhat smaller than the clubs,
but" the fellows managed to have a
good time anyway. On the twenty-
‘ttiird Art Haines incurred the ever-
lasting dignity of the Mandolin club
by leaving it at home while he took
the Glee Club to Uniontown. The size
of the guarantee would not permit of
both clubs making the trip, but after
the people at Uniontown heard the
concert they regretted their too great
caution, and gave assurance that next
year they wanted everything we had.

The season was closed on May
seventh by the Home concert at Car-
negie Music Hall. The clubs were at
their best, and presented a marked
contrast to the unpolished lot that
sang‘ in the State concert.

The Musical clubs have had a suc-
cessful season from whatever stand-
point it is viewed. They began the
season deep in debt, and are now con-
siderably to the good. The musical
end has been a success, as anyone
who has heard a concert can testify.
But the most notable advance is in
the matter of University spirit. The
clubs are now a true student activity,
managed, instructed, and directed by
students’; who have accepted no re-
muneration for their services and
{;)here is real interest among the mem-
ers.

The clubs have worked this year
under a new constitution, which has
been proved to be vastly better than
the old one. A new departure is the
adoption of the apprentice system in

prevails in athletics. Under this
arrangement sophomores may try out
for assistant manager by enrolling as
apprentices. The candidates are as-

trained in the work which will fall
to them to do should they secure the
positions. Apprentices are rated
strictly on the percentage basis. The
number of hours spent on Club busi-
ness, the number of concerts secured,
the number of patronesses secured,
and the number of tickets sold are all
conside'l'ed. The two men having the
highest percentages at the time of

nominated for ﬁrst and second assist-
ant manager, and an election by all
the schools who have men in competi-
tion decides priority. Any sophomore
is eligible for apprenticeship. These
men need not be members of either
club; they need not have any musical
ability Xwhatsoever. All they must
have is plenty of push and energy.

Those interested in the Musical
clubs conﬁdently expect that the com-
ing season will be even more success-
ful. Both the Mandolin and Glee
clubs are somposed in a large part of
freshmen and sophomores, and son-
sequently next year’s organization will
contain a great deal of trained ma-
terial. But there is none the less need
for new material. Every man who
sings or plays, or who thinks he sings
or plays, or who would like to sing or
play should come.

The Plague of Noisiness.

I have often had occasion to re-
mark that many persons mistake
great noisiness for persuasiveness.
They seem to think that in order to
impress their convictions upon their
atuditors they must speak harshly and
obstreperously. They will not admit
a quiet powerfulness, and consequent-
ly rant upon even the most triﬂing
details. a

This habit of speaking boisterously
at all times is greatly to be censured,
since it leads inevitably to the destruc-
tion of one’s perspective; for by treat-
ing major and minor points with equal
vehemence, one soon ﬁnds himself
unable to distinguish between the
worthy and the petty.

There * are persons, strangely
enough, who seem to derive a queer
‘kind of pleasure in unceasing noisy
vehemence, and pride themselves that
they-are very vigorous and leading
personages. But these thoughtless
creatures are not without some virtue
and understanding, and so are often
pardoned for disturbing all persons
within earshot of their bawling. In-
deed they are rather to be pitied than
to be blamed, and (ire not considered
to be masters of themselves, who must
fume over the least obstacle with
which they are confronted. They are
victims of casualty, and are blown
from their posts with every caprice
of chance, no matter how trivial it
may be.

. But this boisterousness is not in
reality anything to be proud of, for,
not only does it lead one to waste
much valuable energy upon insigniﬁ-
cant questions, but it also makes it
impossible for him to give the proper
emphasis to intrinsically momentous
ones, as he is powerless to accord
them their proper additional stress.
He soon ﬁnds himself in the same
position as the merchant, who, having
advertised “the greatest sale in his-
tory” for a great many consecutivtt
weeks, was wonder struck when he
perceived his store empty on a day
when he actually had bargains to of-
fer anyone who would have believed
and responded to his announcement.

There is, however, one defensible
motive for such vocal extravagancies:
it is not pleasing to any man to see
himself wholly overlooked in the mass
of things. Often a narrow knowledge

what he lacks in convincing discourse;
and he takes pleasure in knowing,
that, if he could not be the victor in
a dispute, he at least deferred the
ﬁnal outcome. But, seldom does this
practice gain him attention. He may
frighten into submission a child who
has not yet given up, his belief in
Santa Claus, but those bf his own age
will stand by and laugh at his howl-
ing. And when physical exhaustion
silences him they will go on with their
own quiet discussion-

BALLOTS SOON TO GO OUT.

, The third set of “Who’s Who”
write-ups of men who have been nom-
inated for the vacancies on Alumni
Council are given below. As has been
explained before, the. purpose of these
articles is to acquaint the members
of the General Alumni association,
who are entitled to vote_at the gener-
al election in June, with the ‘men
placed on the ballot by the Nominat-

ing committees, so that they may .

know, when they received their ballot,
who are best ﬁtted for the offices. The
Nominating committee has placed .31
names before the voters, of which
number 25 are to be elected: The
ballots, according to the Constitution,
are to go out 10 days before the date
of the annual meeting in June, the
date of this annual meeting being de-
cided at the meeting of Council
May 17th.

It is suggested that the members of
the asosciation save all the WEEK-
LIES containing these write-ups and
then, when the ballot comes, read
them all over again carefully before
casting the votes. The complete list
of nominations for the officers of the
General Alumni association and for
the members of Alumni Council are

he was compelled to forego this.

JUNE 15th IS. ALUMNI DAY.

Many responses have beg} received
from the members of classes sched-
uled for reunions at Commencement
time and the indications point to a
very. successful number of “get-to-
gethers” on the part of the “grads.”

The 1910 class officers have been
busy and have sent their notices out
to all the members whose addresses
are known. A number of the men of
that class have written or called to
see the Secretary personally and they
are all enthusiastic over the plans.
It is likely that a number of the 1910
boys will be able to follow the plan
originally suggested and spend the
entire day with the University, Tues-
day, June 15th, being assigned as AL-
UMNI DAY.

This class has been away from the
campus four years now and as many
of them have been out of Pittsburgh
for that length of time, they will see
many new sights when they return.
The taking of a class picture around
the 1910 tree near Thaw hall and a
banquet at the Pittsburgh Athletic
association in the evening with “Uncle
Dan” Carhart as honor guest are the
leading features planned. Members
of this class are requested to com-
municate with John J. O’Connor, c-o
Mellon Institute, or with the General
Alumni . Secretary.

The slogan of this class is “Back
to the old class tree” and with all
the notices that are being sent to
members is a print of the tree taken
last year, with O’Connor, Ramsey and
Reizenstein seated around it. The- 1910
boys say that the picture this year.
will‘ include many of the faces of that
class, which was the ﬁrst to graduate
from the Schenley Farms campus.
They are proud of this distinction and
also of the fact that they were the
ring leaders in getting the class tree

1' The 91914 class is being. worked up
by M. A. Follansbee, president. He is
located at Follansbee, W. Va., clo
Follansbee Tin Plate Company and
members who do not receive notices
are requested to write him immediate-
ly. The General Secretary has re-
ceived a letter from a Committee of
the girl graduates of that class in
which they state that they will likely
plan a separate reunion at Commence-
ment time. This seems to be the best
plan and the girls of all the reunion
classes might proﬁt by their example.

‘L. W. McIntyre is the “booster” for
the 1912 reunion and he can be reach-
ed at 3317 Ridgeway street, Pitts-
burgh. This class is sure to have a

early to work up theiraifair.

The General Secretary has had con-
ferences with several representatives
of the classes of 1906, 1907 and 1908
and plans for their reunions are well
under way. We hope to have more
deﬁnite information by the next is-
sue. All the men we have talked to
about this are very much interested.
Therxolder classes will also be gotten
in me. .

For fear you might not know-—the
followin classes are scheduled for re-
unions t is June:

1914, 1912, 1910, 1908, 1907, 1906,
1890, 1889, 1888, 1887, 1871, 1870,
1869, 1868, 1852, 1851, 1850, 1849.

If you are a member of any of these
classes and haven’t heard from any
one regarding the reunion, write the
General Secretary, 421 Park building,
He will see that you get in touch
with the right party. _

VARSITY "TEAMS PLAY AT
' FORBES FIELD SATURDAY.

Many alumni are expected to be at
Forbes ﬁeld, Saturday, to see the
Varsity baseball team hook up with
Pennsylvania State. On the same
ﬁeld lasts Thanksgiving day, we won
from the Center Countians in football
and Capt. “Red” Healy’s nine expects
to repeat on the diamond Saturday.
Either Langdon or Hart will twirl,
possibly the former. Penn State has
been making a great record and the
game will be a hummer.

A track meet with Carnegie Tech
at 1 p. in. will start the proceedings,
the ball game following. The decisive
defeat of W. & J. in track last week
presages another victory over “Tech,”
although the score will likely be pret-
ty close. Why not come out and en-
joy the day with the athletes? Satur-.-
day being a half holiday with the ma-
jority of business concerns, you should
be able to get away and see the track
and. baseball boys in action. It will
be the best chance of the year. The
general admission for the afternoon
is 50 cents.

We want to work up a little more
support on the part of the alumni in
athletics as.the members of the teams
are entitled_ to this encouragement.
Many alumni attended the basketball
games last winter and were enthusi-
a_stic over the work of Capt. Ochsen-
hirt’s team. Support for football is
all that can be asked for. How about
baseball and track?

Don’t forget the athletic events at
Commencement - time. The annual
alumni-Varsity baseball game will be
played Commencement day, Wednes-

lday, Jrune/16th. W. & J. is played

at the stadium Saturday, June 12th,
and at Washington, Tuesday, June
15th. Some of the best known base-
ball stars of the last decade will per-
form on the alumni team. “Bob”
Grove, former Varsity manager, is
getting up the alumni nine.

PITT QUICK LUNCH CLUB.

 

Several new members were added
to the “Pitt Quick Lunch Club,” at
Miller's restaurant, Smithﬁeld street,
last week and several others expect
to come in this week. As we explain-
ed in the original article two weeks
ago this is a very informal meeting
place at lunch time for some of the
younger graduates. The rates are
very reasonable and a Pitt man who
drops in there is usually able to ﬁnd
a half dozen or more fellows he knew
when in college. Older graduates
aren't debarred, by any means,——in
fact, any gnan who ever. went to the
-University is more than welcome.

C. R. Helt '14, H. F. Jenkins '14,
“Bob” Peck, the all around athletic
star, and Harry G. Fry, Jr., (not a
Pitt man but “daddy” of a good one)
were in last week. Why not join the
crowd? Call up the General Secre-

When ‘the crowd becomes large
enough, we will be able to secure a
special room for the Lunch Club. Help
make this possible. You will hear all
the latest University gossip by being
there daily.

BLUE oowus

The University track team_ clearly
thawed Pitt’s athletic superiority over
Washington and Jefferson in this de-

partment when they captured 412 out
' of a possible 14 ﬁrsts in the annual

dual track and ﬁeld meet held on
Schenley Oval last Friday afternoon.
Led by Burwell with three ﬁrsts and
Sheehan with two ﬁrsts and a second
the Pitt athletes scored 95 points to
their opponents’ 31. Only in one
event, the 220 yard low hurdles, was
the Red and Black team able to take
first honors, and in this Pitt lost out
when their entry took a bad fall. The
closest they came in any event to
landing ﬁrst honors was in the pole
vault, where Reich succeeded in ty-
ing McMasters.

n spite of a heavy track and a
strong wind, two Pitt records were
lowered during the afternoon. Bur-
well, after winning both the 100-yard
and the 220-yard dashes, sped over
the 440-yard course in 50 3-5 seconds,
lowering by two-ﬁfths of a second the
former mark of 51 seconds, made by

E. Ross ﬁve seasons ago. The
time is all the more remarkable con-
sidering the heavy track and his exer-
tions in the two previous events.
Livermore sent the * previous record
for the two miles, ﬂying when he

- covered the distance in 10 minutes .6

1-! seconds. This betters the former
record held by Grumbling by 11 4-5
seconds. In this race he was pushed
hard the entire distance by the form-
er record holder bvut pulled ahead on
the last quarter.

The weather conditions were very
unfavorable. Besides the wet track a
strong wind was blowing and the ﬁnal
events were run off in a downpour of
The excellent showing made
under these conditions gives good
hope of more records being broken
this season. The men are just round-
ing into form and already they have
lowered three former records.

Burwell was easily the star of the
afternoon, winning all the dashes in
fast time. He led the Pitt team in in-
dividual scoring with 15 points.
“Johnny” Sheehan, by winning both
the high and the broad jumps and by
taking second in the 100-yard dash,
was a close secondwith 13 points.

7 Fry, the football star, after winning

the shot put and the 120-yard high
hurdles, suffered a badfall in the 220-
yard high hurdles and was unable to
place in this event. Lou McMaster
and Sutherland were tied for fourth
place with eight points each. Mc-
Master tied with Reich in the pole
vsvult at 11 feet'6 inches, ﬁnished sec-
ond in the broad jump and third in
the 100-yard dash. In attempting the
12 feet in the pole vault he had the
bar cleared but on descending struck
it with his elbow. Sutherland won
the discus and took second in the shot
put.

The contest in the pole vault was
the most exciting of the afternoon.
Reich, the Detroit star at W. & J.,
compelled McMaster to divide ﬁrst
place with him at 11 feet 6 inches.
Berman of Pitt took third honors in
this event. Gantos proved to be the
dark horse in the one mile run, ﬁn-
ishing well ahead of the other entries.
Taking the lead at the ﬁrst he was
‘never headed, although Elder of W.
& J._and Thomas of Pitt hung on his
heels the whole way.

The 2-mile run proved to be a runa-
way for Pitt, the Gold and Blue men
taking ﬁrst, second and third places
in this. The end of the race saw the
Washington boys a quarter of a mile
in the rear. The 120-yard high
hurles was so closely contested that
the judges were undecided at the end
and ﬁnally picked Fry as winner over
Smith of W. & J. Smith was the in-
dividual star for ‘his team, scoring 10
points. He took second in the 100-
yard high hurdles, the discus, and the
220 low hurdles, and third in the shot
put. , I

Burwell runs the century in 10 4-5,
the furlong in 23 3-5, and the quarter
in 50 3-5. At this rate of progression
his time for the marathon distance
ought to be a few degrees below zero.

 

To a man up a tree, it looks as
though somebody’s judgment slipped
when Hart was kept in throughout
the Navy game. Indiana Albert was
several kilometers away from his
usual form, and was in the hole con-
timually. With two other good pitchers
on the bench, there was no good rea-
son why “Al" should have had to ab-
sorb all that punishment.

Unless it’s Ham Hyatt running the
bases, we don’t know of anything much
funnier than “Bugs” O’Donne1l pitch-
ing. For a lifelike imitation of Sam
Crawford puncturing fences, we rec-
ommend “Bugs ;” but as a pitcher, not
hardly.

Steve Dillon’s departure will be felt
by all Pitt fans who have many times
waited for the Trojan’s turn at bat,
banking on a base-cleaning swat.
Steve was the original “sweet hitter,”
about the most powerful offensive
unit now extant, excluding the 42-
centimeter gun. Every one of his

friends here will pull for his success
in his new situation. A

W. & J. was oppressed with the
usual luck of the loser last Friday.
In two or three events they were
nosed out by inches at the ﬁnish, and
in several other places their repre-
sentatives fell below expectations.
Young was peculiarly unfortunate,
taking third in the discus, although
less than a foot behind Sutherland,
and losing out in the hammer on'the
very last throw, when Collins out-
distanced him by a foot.

 

At any other time, Dayton Mays’
work in the quarter would have proven
a sensation; but with Burwell smash-
ing the old mark ahead of him, the
Punxsy boy’s performanbe last Fri-
day didn’t receive proper attention.
Mays ran the distance in something
like 51 2-5, time which has been bet-
tered by only two men in Pitt’s his-
tory—Burwell and Ross.

With clear weather and a good
track, local records for the sprints;
will be in danger Saturday, at Forbes
Field. The competition between Hem-
mann, of Tech, and our own Burwell
ought to be torrid enough to make
anybody happy.

 

The high cost of living will receive
at least one jolt on Saturday, when
athletic fans get two admissions for
the price of one. Fans who go to the
Pitt-Tech meet that day will be per-
mitted to stick for the Pitt-State
baseball game immediately following,
and no question asked. And student
books are good. ‘

 

There is a rumor about, the source

"of which cannot be exactly determin-

ed, that those who attend Saturday's
double event will also be privileged to
gaze upon that most rare of all human
species, a Pitt cheerleader. We don’t
want to raise false hopes in the read-
er’s breast; but it may be worth while
to go early, and take a chance on giv-
ing the o. o. to one of the creatures.

“Handsome Claude” Healy will be
out this afternoon to get revenge on
“Desperate Desmond” from Alle-
gheny. Brookmire, who tied Pitt in
bow-knots at Meadville some weeks
ago, is due to throw the bulb for the
visitors. The setting is almost per-
fect for the getting-even stuﬁ’.

Coming down to the point of it, we
aren’t too proud to lay claim to that
tennis team, either. Five matches-
count ’em—to one against Georgetown
isn't so bad.

Let it be understood now once and
for all that the gentleman who holds
down the third corner of the Pitt
diamond makes a vigorous objection-
to being described as “stocky.” Any
person who wishes to make a hit with
and win De Hart of this baseball star
must abstain from all such references
to his “form.”

Looked like old times last Friday,
when Sheehan and McMaster took sec-
ond and third in the hundred. These
two performers haven’t.been together
in a sprint since prep school days.

When Jim Morrow took the mad

sprint along the shores of Chesapeake
Bay in pursuit of Middy Rodgers’
home run hit, he came near outdoing
even the record made upon those self-
same shores during the’ Pitt-Navy"
football game when “The Lock Haven
Kid” struck the Mazcppa stride.

In Gray the Pitt baseball team
possesses a player of rather uncom-
mon versatility. Behind the bat he is
able to hold his own with the best
and in any one of the four inﬁeld
positions he is an unfailing perform-
er, while his proﬁciency at clubbing
the pellet is not to he smiled at.

NAVY TEAM
mo Moon
roo PITT

The Pitt nine, after tying the score
in the fourth and playing the Middies
to a standstill, blew in the eighth
and the side was not retired tuntil ﬁve
of the Navy men had rambled across
the pan. The game up to that event-
ful eight was a ﬁne one to -see and,
the teams were battling on even
terms. The Navy had taken the lead
when they registered twice in the sec-
ond frame. Pitt evened up things,
however, in the fourth by bunching
three hits with a free pass to first.
After that it was nip and tuck until
the Sailors put the game on ice by a
combination of hits and errors on the
part of the Pitt men.

The game opened with Hart in the
box for the Gold and the Blue and T.
Smith doing the hurling for the Navy.
Neither of the twirlers were in any
too good’ form. Hart from the ﬁrst
seemed to be wild and was continual.-
ly getting into the hole. However, he
weathered it safely until the eighth
when ;they got to him for the ﬁve
tallies. While Hart is going well, yet
it is hard to see why Langdon was not
used. The big port-sider is in about
the best shape that he has been for
some time and after his showing
against the West Virginia nine, the
week before, it certainly seemed a
bone not to play him Wednesday.
Hindsight is always better than fore-
sight but this is a free country and
“them’s our sentiments.”

Navy started the scoring in their
half of the second inning. H. Fisher
opened with a single to right, Cal-
houn advanced him with a Texas
leaguer to right, but Fisher was out
trying to pilfer third. Rogers worked
Hart for a free ticket and both moved
up on Glover’s out. Both scored on
Smith’s triple. T. Fisher flied out to
Morrow. Pitt was unable to do any-
thing to Smith’s offerings ‘until the
fourth. Beattie, ﬁrst man up, was
walked, and promptly stole second.
Glover smothered Healey’s high foul.
Hastings went out the same way. With
two down and a man on second Peck
came through with a triple to the
right ﬁeld fence. Dillon scored Peck
with a single to left. -Englehardt
singled and stole second. Morrow
grounded out to second base.

Neither side scored until the eighth.
This is how it happened. T. Fisher
beat out an inﬁeld hit. Adams singled
to left and Fisher moved over to third
on Englehardt’s wild heave. A. Smith
grounded out to the shortstop, Fisher
advancing to second. Hicks sent both
runners home with a slashing double.
Hart passed H. Fisher, but Calhoun
watched a third strike ﬂoat by. With

 

- two on Rodgers poled out a home run

and three more tallies were rung up.
Glover also walked, but Smith ended
the agony by grounding out to the in-
ﬁeld. Although Pitt’s ﬁrst man up in
the ninth walked and was advanced
to third on a hit with one out, yet
the old timelyhit was lacking and the
game ended with Pitt on the short
end of a 7 to 2 score.

ALLEGHENY VS. PITT.

’ This afternoon the baseball nines
of Allegheny and Pitt line up on Trees

on.
prise and disgust of the Gold and
Blue players, the up—state boys took
the measure of the local lads to the
tune of 2 to 1. The Pitt team had
rather looked for an easy victory over
the Methodists and the result was a
rude‘ surprise to them. The offerings
of Brookmier in that game had the
University boys guessing and he is-
but to make this game a repetition
of the ﬁrst.

However the defeat’ the team 1_‘e-
ceived at the hands of the Midd_ies
has aroused the men to a ﬁghting
spirit and they are out for revenge.
A victory over Allegheny this after-
noon and another over Penn State
Saturday will be a pretty good record
for one week. The game this after-
noon should prove an excitingone, as
both teams are primed for the’ contest.

TENNIS TEAM wms ~
  oven “GEORGETOWN

The University‘ Tennis team opened
their invasion of the East Manday
by defeating the strong team that
represents Georgetown on the courts
this year. Everything was Pitt’s until
the last match when, after taking the
ﬁrst set, Ebe and Haines lost the next
two to the Georgetown team. Mc-
Ellroy and Gaut kept up their sensa-
tional work, downing the best men on
the Capital City's squad. They won
both their matches in the singles and
the doubles. »

McEllroy opened up the game by
defeating O’Boyle in straight sets 6-2,
6-3. Gaut had a harder time of it,
but ﬁnally won out over McGuire, in
straight sets, the second one running
into a deuce set, 6-4,,7-5. Ebe had the
best of Jones and won handily‘ 6-2,
E-5. Haines after winning the ﬁrst
game dropped the second, but won
out in the third, 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.

In the doubles McEllroy and Grant
won over McGuire and Hones, 6-2,
6-4. However O’Boyle and Smearley
came back and took the measure of
Ebe and Haines. The Pitt representa-
tives took the ﬁrst game but dropped
the next two, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.

This victory over Georgetown marks
the ﬁrst match of the Eastern inva-
sion. Yesterday the team met the
Navy at Annapolis, today, University
of Pennsylvania is met at Philadel-
phia. The matches with Princeton to-
morrow end the trip.

 

Dillon kept up his good work with
the stick, being the only man on either
team to grab two hits. Peck’s triple
and Rodgers’. home run were the pro-
ductive hits of the fracas. Beattie
and Englehardt both pilfered sacks
for Pitt, while H. Fisher nabbed two.

PITT OOURT  
TEAM TIES
PENN STATE

While the Track team was taking
over the W. & J. team on the Schen-
ley Oval, the Tennis team were batt-
ling the Penn State court team to a
tie on the P. A. A. courts. Each team
won two singles and a double, leaving
the result a tie. This was the ﬁrst
appearance of the local team this year
and two new men were seen in action
for the ﬁrst time.

McEllroy, playing a ﬂashy game
from the start, easily defeated Nevin
of State in straight sets. Nevin has
a reputation for being one of the best
racquet wielders in this part of the
state, but he did not prove a match
for the craftygame _McEllroy handed
out. Captain Gaut likewise had an
easy time, winning his match in
straight sets 6-2, 6-0. Both McEllroy
and Gaut are playing in their old-
time form and displayed a brand of
the game that downed all opposition.

Haines of Pitt was no match for
McCance of State and lost his match
6-3, 6-0. State also won the other
single, when Smedley downed Ebe,
6-3, 6-1, The matches in the singles
although hard fought were all won in
straight sets. The inexperience of
Pitt’s two new men worked against
them and it was up to the members
of last year’s squad to pull them
through by winning their matches.

 

The "doubles were harder fought and
much more interesting than the
singles. Again in these the team
split up, Pitt winning the ﬁrst match
and State the second. Haines and

. Ebe playing together in the doubles’

played beter than they had in the
singles and forced the Center county
men to go; into extra innings to win
the match. State was behind 5-4 in
the ﬁrst set, but came back and by
winning the next three games. took
the set 7-5. The next set saw State
take the lead 5-2 and then lose out
8-10. State came back in the next
and took it 6-3.

McEllroy and Gaut had things all
their ‘way and took their sets 6-4,
6-2. Jones and Nevin, State’s best

' bets were clearly outclassed by Pitt’s

two stars. The McEllroy-Gaut com-
bination is about the best that has
ever represented the University on the
tennis courts. It is hard to see how
they will lose a match this year.
Haines and Ebe while new at the
game have earmarks of ﬁrst class
players and a little seasoning should
bring them out. A return match with
Penn State may be played to decide
the championship of Western Penn-
sylvania, as Pitt and Penn State
seem to have the class of the college
teams in this end of the state.» -The
match, if played, will probably be
staged at State college the first week
of next month.

PENN STATE TEAM
ON OARO SATURDAY

The Blue and Gold baseball team
will be pitted against the formidable
State College nine at Forbes ﬁeld next
Saturday afternoon in a life and death
grapple for its reputation.

The men from Center county have
carved for themselves a most enviable
record thus far this season. All in-
vasions into the territory of their ath-
letic enemies have resulted favorably
to their credit. They defeated Tech
by a slightly smaller score than did
the charges of Coach Wilson, but it
must be remembered that the Wag-
nerians took a decided brace after the
drubbing handed them by the Pitt-
men. All the leading colleges and
universities of the east, with the ex-
ception of Yale and Harvard, have
fallen before the skilful work of the
Pennsylvanians, and they come to
Pittsiiztvurgh conﬁdent of a favorable
resu .

 

This game ﬁnds Pitt with no very.

enviable record to bank upon. They
have defeated Tech and the West Vir-
ginians but suﬂ'ered ignominy at the
hands of the Methodists and Middies.
It is therefor a crucial moment in the
season. Should the team come across
with a win over the tried veterans of
State it would completely balance the
earlier reverses, but should the up-
state men succeed in landing the game
it would mean another of the big
games of the year marked up on the
wrong side of the sporting ledger.

The men who will face the Blue
and White squad have not yet been
announced, but it is suspected that
the composition of the team will be
practically the same as that which
has faced all the Pitt opponents thus
far this season. Langdon is popular-
ly expected to deliver to Beattie un-
less Coach Wilson arrives at some
other"conc1usion. There will be anoth-
er change in the line up inasmuch as
the left garden will be tenanted by
Gray. This position was formerly
ﬁlled by “Steve” Dillon.

Pitt men still maintain that in their
team they have the greatest aggrega-
tion of stars that ever graced a col-
lege diamond. Dwelling on the fact
that this collection of men though
possessed of stellar baseball qualities
fail to win consistently, there is no
condemnation but "the idea is preval-
ent that the fellows have not yet hit
their stride and that this step will be
reached before the clash with the
State men Saturday.

FIRST YEAR MEN
DOWN BEAVER.

The Freshmen continued their Pir-
ate streak Saturday, by annihilating
Beaver high by the tally of nearly a
score to one on the home ﬁeld of that
aggregation.

The game was started off by Ken-
nedy, but he was soon withdrawn in
favor of “Bugs” O’Donnell, who ﬁn-
ished the game without mishap. The
whole game was one great merry-
go-round for the ﬁrst-year men, and
every member of the Freshman team
boosted his batting average at the
expense of the up—state high school
men. 5

Despite the one-sided result of the
affair it was generally conceded that
the Beaver boys were capable of a

SEESAW GAME.

 

The baseball representatives of the
East Liberty Academy went down to
defeat before the Pitt Freshmen nine
at Trees Stadium last Wednesday
afternoon by. the somewhat ponder-
ous score of 10-9 after eleven innings
of battle. Things looked bad for the
first-year men in the first inning when
on a hit, a pass and an error the visi-
tors succeeded in pushing a man
across the home corner. The Pitts-
burg men proved themselves equal to
the emergency, however, and came
back with two runs in their half of the
round. The second inning was score-
less, but during the next four frames
Carlsons aggregation collected enough
tallies to make the score a ﬁve to
three affair. In the seventh the call-
out
enough bingles to score ﬁve runs,
which gave them a three point lead.
Ammons’ charges were game and
stuck three more entries into their
column during the latter half of the
inning, thus tying the score. The
twoaggragations raced neck and _neck
untif the eleventh, when another run
was hooked up'by the Blue and Gold
men. , /

Thomas, barring two bad innings,
pitched..fair ball and allowed the visi-
tors very little satisfaction. Black
was substituted in the latter innings
of the game and was even more be-
wildering to the E. L. A. collection
than had Thomas been.

MARSHMAN [EDWARD .(“Poppy"’)
WADSWORTH. »

Dr. Wadsworth commenced teach-
ing when sixteen and during his pre-
paratory work and through his col-
lege course he taught from one to
three terms a year, keeping up with
his class and graduating with good
rank in 1869, although his actual resi-
dence at Bowdin amounted to only 42
weeks and three days. After grad-
uation he became principal and super-
intendent of gfaded schools in Minne-
sota and Wisconsin for four years,
going to Harvard University in 1873
to pursue .study under Louis Agas-
siz, J. P. Cooke, and C. E. Mtunroe.
In 1873 he was elected Professor of
Chemistry in the Boston Dental Col-

play ilege, which chair he resigned in 1874

to accept an instructorship in mathe-
matics and mineralogy in Harvard.
in 1874 he served on the Geological
Survey of New Hampshire and was
Assistant Geologist of the Minnesota

. Geological Survey in 1886-87, State

Geologist of Michigan from 1888 to
1893, and Geologist of the Pennsyl-
vania State Board of Agriculture 1902
to 1905. .

From 1877 to 1887 Dr. Wadsworth
was closely associated Assistant in
Geology with Prof. J. D. Whitney, one
of the foremost of the then living
geologists. While engaged in teach-
ing during this time, he was actively
employed in laboratory research ‘and
in ﬁeld exploration. His publications
at that time brought him correspond-
ence from the entire scientiﬁc world,
as he was one of the_pioneers in this
country in Microscopical Petrography,
teaching the ﬁrst course in that sub-
ject ever given in America. His petro-
graphical work and his work upon the
crystalline rocks, in connection ‘with
Professor Whitney, revolutionized the
systems and methods of that day. _ In
the microscopical study of meteorites
Dr. Wadsworth also anticipated the
results afterwards obtainedrfby the
then foremost European authority in
that ﬁeld. .

In 1884 and 1885 Dr. Wadsworth
spent much time in England and upon
the continent studying the advanced
modern petrographical methods with
Prof. H. Rosenbusch at Heidelberg,
and in visiting many of the foremost
universities of England, Germany,
Austria, and France, familiarizing
himself wtih their methods and becom-
ing personally acquainted_ with the
leading men in his specialties.

In 1885 he was elected to the re-
cently established chair of Mineral-
ogy and Geology in Colby University,
whose entire curriculum was remodel-
ed by him and the foundation laid for
their present system.

Bowdoin in 1869 and A.M. in 1872,
also that ‘of A.M. from Harvard in
1874 after passing a two days’ writ-
ten and oral examination. In 1879 he
received the degree of Ph.D. from
Harvard, presenting a thesis upon the
“Classiﬁcation of Rocks,” and pass-
ing an examination before a commit-
tee consisting. amongst others, of Asa
Gray, J. D. Whitney O. W. Holmes,
J. M. Pierce, and in. James.

In his work as an investigator and
an educator Dr. Wadsworth has never
been a servile follower, but has taken
new and advanced lines in both ﬁelds.
As an investigator he has publsihed
new and original classiﬁcations of
rocks, mineral deposits, meteorites,
etc. As an educator he has built up
12 departments, two schools, and one
college. He originated the practical“-'
ly continuous year (45 weeks) and
the elective system still employed in
the Michigan College of Mines——the
ﬁrst one used in anq engineering
school in America. He introduced
into Pennsylvania State college its
optional system and also the then-
broadest and most advanced course in
mining in existence; while in the
School of Mines in this University he
arranged a still broader and -more ad--
vanced curriculum, laboring to make
the school a graduate and professional
one that should be second to none. In
these three schools the courses have
