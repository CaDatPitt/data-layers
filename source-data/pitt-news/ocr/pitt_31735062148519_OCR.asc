Starzynski Declines
Chairman ship of Finnish
Relief Fund Committee

Student-Faculty Association Expresses Desire
To Continue Drive for University Aid to Finland

By Jack Brady
Because he thought the plan for collection of funds on the Uni-
versity campus for relief of Finnish civilian sufferers was insuffi-
cient in scope, Ted Starzynski, C40, refused to accept. the chairman-
ship of the coinniittee at Tuesday evening’s meeting of the Student-

Faculty Association.

Starz_ynski inaiiitained that the
idea behind the move is “just a
narrow and superficial aspect of
a far larger problem,” but he is
heartily in favor of the idea as
far as it goes.

But, despite the arguments ad-
vanced by Starzynski, the assembly
felt‘ that they were committed to
carry on with the program for Fin-
nish relief as previously planned
and will select a new chairman.

The form of the commitment was
a letter written by the executive
committee to Rufus H. Fitzgerald,
provost of the University, agreeing
to carry through with the plan for
student contributions.

As this letter was dispatched at
the beginning of the month, the
assembly believed that it would be
unethical not to fulfill the promise.

Starzynski said, “The Finns are a
race to be admired for their cour-
age, perseverance and steadfastness
to ideals that we, as Americans, hold
most dear. Too, their ideals and
morals—-religious, ethical and polit-
ical——-are practically the same as
ours, but does this necessarily mean
that we are to contribute to the
Finns alone?”

He emphasized the fact that the
Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, and the
Ukraihiians also need aid.

Refuses Job for Principle

“It is not the great amount of
money to be be donated by the stu-
dents of the University,” be de-
clared, “nor is it the great amount
of beneﬁt to be derived from these
funds, but what appears to me to
be involved is the question, ‘Are we
morally right in donating to only
one suppressed group?’ ”

The main idea behind the drive is
to gather contributions to help those
civilians suffering from the imper-
ialist aggression of other nations,
Starzynski explained.

Suggesting ‘that the funds should
be sent to the American Friend so-
ciety, Starzynski said, “the funds

Officers Attend Perm Sta/.telMeet

Despite the recent ruling of the
Fraternity President’s Council on
the “no-politics” plan for women’s
fraternities on campus, no discussion
was brought before the assembly.
This was contrary to the expecta-
tions of campus political leaders.

Other business decided at the
meeting by the assembly was to
send a pair of delegates to a con-
ference on student government at
Penn State College from March 1
to Mar-ch 3.

The delegates selected were Pat

lndependents
Will Nominate
In Open Meet

The Independent Party will again
nominate candidates for this year’s
student elections at an open party
nominating convention to be held
next month, party leaders announc-
ed yesterday.

In announcing the Independent
Party’s decision to again employ
the open nominating convention this
year, Jack Hoeveler, C40, party
leader and spokesman, declared:
“The open nominating convention is
the most progressive step in the di-
rcction of clean politics in Pitt for
many years. It gives the inde-
pendent student an opportunity to
stand on his own record and to
compete on an even basis with a
fraternity man under our high pres-
sure election system.”

A drive is under way to interest
freshmen in campus politics, it was
also announced Friday. “Healthy
political competition forces both
the fraternities and the indepen-
dents to put forth their best men,
and consequently improves the per-
sonnel and general interest in stu-
dent government,” Hoeveler said

in explaining the move.

Friday I‘-‘reshman. Club
Holds Panel Discussion

International affairs will be the
subject of a panel discussion at the
meeting of the Friday Freshman
Club today in the Y club rooms,
Forbes and Bouquet streets, at 12:30
o’clock.

Thursday and Friday Freshman
Club members are inviting upper-
classmen to attend their theater
party tonight at the Fulton theater.
All are requested to meet at the

theater at 8 o’clock. Admission will
be 30 cents.

would then be distributed according
to the needs of the people, and con-
tributors would be sure that their
donations would go where most
needed.”

In refusing to consider the chair-
manship, he explained that he could
not readily undertake the work of
the committee, because, “the drive
does not conform to my ideas.”

He continued, “The only reason I
rejected this chairmanship was to
absolve myself of the responsibility
of heading a project whose exist-
ence, considered from the stand-
point of logical validity and moral
soundedness, I could not fully just-
ify.”

Cusick, E40, president and Jack
Hoeveler, C40, vice president. Pur-
pose of this meeting which will be
attended by delegates from over 30
colleges and universities through-
out the tri-state area, is a better un-
derstanding of student government
and the possible improvements
which can be made in the present
system. .

Committee reports were given by
the following committee chairmen:
Joseph Roberts, C41, social; David
Tucker, C41, theater; Ted Konet-
sky, C40, building and grounds;
David Mackey, E40, music appre-
ciation; Roger Powell, C41, statis-
tics; a report of the activities of
the Scholar’s Day committee was
also read.

Atom Bombardment

May End This Earth:

That chem students love life was
proved recently by the excitement
and hurried whispers caused by a
statement made by Dr. Kendall
Tesh, professor of chemistry, in a
lecture on nuclear chemistry.

The statement was, “The world
is going to blow up.”

The students sighed, however,
when it was explained that the
blowing up of the world is only a
fear of physicists. It is their belief
that the atoms which they are
smashing might some day cause
“(her atoms to break down. This
would bring about a chain of de-
struction that would put an end
to this earth and all that is on it.

Psychology Faculty
Considers Movies A
Safer Than Truth

After having one of its faculty
members bitten by a rat, the psy-
chology department decided that
movies were a safer way to observe
an experiment.

Dr. Harry W. Karn, instructor in
psychology, and Robert A. Patton,
graduate student assistant in psy-
chology, performed an experiment
last week on the behavior of neuro-
tic rates in the animal laboratory on
the thirty—seventh floor of the Ca-
thedral. During the experiment,
Mr. Patton was bitten on the hand
by one of his furry friends.

Several psychology classes saw
the experiment on Wednesday, but
the live rats weren’t present. The
department played safe and used
movies of the experiments which
were made recently at the Univer-
sity of Michigan,

As Rushing Daze Returns

By Georgia Shuset
Hot off the wire comes the report that Dora Drizzlepuss, staff mem-
ber of the Owl, the Panther, member of Women’s Debating, Women’s
Choral, Cwens, Panhellenic Council, mentor, unit adviser, member of
Pitt Players, and the Pitt girl who went to the Inter-Fraternity Ball, has

just smiled upon Winnie Wallﬂower.

know, is a freshman. Dora is a
fraternity Woman.

And for your additional informa-
tion, it’s women’s fraternity rush
week at the University.

Parents Are Patient

Winnie’s parents have been pa-
tient. They haven’t complained too
much when their beloved offspring
came home bedecked with gardenia
corsages, carrying bowls with a pair
of goldﬁsh in them (they actually
give them away as favors, we hear)
and warbling “I' wannabe a soror-
ity girl, mm-mm, and a little bit
more. I wanna be a Pi Pi Pi mm-
mm, and a little bit more’? That
was bad enough. But now comes a
smile from Dora Drizzlepussll

G-awsh!!!

Winnie Is Invited

Winnie, together with her fellow
rushees, will. receive their invita-
tions to the Saturday parties some-
time between 10:30 and 12:30 o’clock
today from the office of the dean of
women. The invitations must be
answered on the forms provided by
Panhellenic Council and left in the
office before 5 o’clock this afternoon.

Tomorrow’s parties and what—not
end the “formal” rushing season.
The affairs are scheduled to last
from 10 o’clock Saturday morning
until 12 o’clock in the afternoon; they
pick up where they left off at 5:30
o’clock in the afternoon and con-
tinue until 12 o’clock Sunday night.

Says Winnie: “It’s suwelll”

Says Dora: “Thank goodness it’s
over!!”

Waite Replaces

Trainer Dees

Illinois Graduate Fills
Resignation Vacancy

Howard E. Waite, assistant pro-
fessor of physical education and
head trainer at the University of
Colorado since 1935, will ﬁll the va-
cancy created here in January by
the resignation of head trainer
Elwyn. Dees, who is now established
at the University of Nebraska.

Head trainer Waite was schooled
in Illinois. He attended Urbana
high school and the University of
Illinois, graduating from the latter
in 1930. In his last two years of
college he was assistant trainer to
the Illinois veteran trainer “Matt”
Bullock.

After graduation he was affiliated
with the physical education depart-
ment of Colorado college for five
years. While there he acted  head
trainer and instructor of physical
education, served in the intramural
department, coached wrestling and
golf, and supervised the required
physical education program.

The University of Colorado claim-
ed him in 1935 as head trainer and
physical education instructor. Two
years later he was promoted to an
assistant professorship which, in ad-
dition to his training duties, found
him working with corrective classes
and supervising swimming. Waite’s
final four years at the University of
Colorado were spent as swimming
coach.

Waite will take over his head
trainer’s duties here when he com-
pletes his affairs in Boulder, Col-
orado.

Lelloy Will Play

Bill LeRoy and his orchestra, fea-
turing Joan deMore, will play for

Babalis, P43, class officers, are in
charge of the annual semi-formal
event. Tickets priced at $2 may be

Democracy

Dr. Graper Analyzes ICC

“Compromise is the essence of
politics—that’s the way democracy
democs,” declared Dr. Elmer D.
G-raper, professor and head of the
department of political science,
analyzing the role of the Intercol-
legiate Conferencejon Government
in the training of students special-
izing in the study of government.

Featured speaker at the organiza-
tion meeting of the ICG last Wed-
nesday, Dr. Graper——“da_ddy of _the
ICG”—-analyzed the organization as
“an. experiment in democracy” as
it exists in the United States, “in
the Pittsburgh city council, at Har-
risburg, in Congress, or anywhere
except Germany or Russia.”

“It is, as well, a_ rare opportunity
for students in government to meet
with other equally informed stu-

dents. You will learn just what
politics is,” he said.

Recalling the troubles of Nicholas
Murray Butler in. drawing up plat-
forms of past national political con-
ventions, Dr. Graper revealed that
“l’ve heard students make deals
with one another at ICG; in this
way they engage in practical poli-
tics, because compromise is what
politics is made of.” “ ’

As “daddy of the ICG,” Dr. -Grap-
er suggested the state—wide inte'r-
collegiate congress to two bewilder-
ed political science students eight
years ago. For the past seven years
one of those students, Genevieve
Blatt, ’33, now chief examiner for
‘the Pittsburgh civil service commis-
sion, has been executive director of
such a congress, now the ICG.’

Celebrating the 1.53111 anulvern
sary of the founding‘ of the Uni-
versity, the General Alumni As-
sociation. will 1:)resent a variety
Charter Day program this even-
ing at 8 :15 o’clock in Foster

Scully, ’04, ex-ofﬁcio member of

Bruce Palmer, ’99, grandson of
Robert Bruce, principal of Pitts-
burgh Academy in 1820.
Chancellor Speaks

Chancellor John G. Bowman will
greet the alumni in a short welcom-
ing address.

Heading the list of alumni enter-
tainers is the most recent graduate
among them, Fred Kelly, ’39, who

dance. Kelly is a former Cap and
Gown star and a cast member of
the Pittsburgh Playhouse revue.

Dr. Michael Ignelzi, ’29, banjo
player who is famed for his fresh-
man banquet appearances will pre.
sent another part of the evening’s
program. Arthur James, ’25, and
several other old Cap and Gowners

To Library System
Editor, the Pitt News:

One week after the beginning of
the semester, I walked into the re-
serve book room, threw open my
lips and said, “I want the ‘Twelfth
Annual Abstract of the Proceed-
ings’.” Then, the bushy haired man
at the desk broke in with, “We have
slips, you know.” And he shoved
one of the things at me.

Now, why slips at the reserve
book room? I can understand why
so on the ﬁfth’ floor. It would be
inconvenient to leap over the lend-
ing room desk, squat into a basket,
and ride the endless chain down to
the stacks. And, as you passed by,
shout out the name of 21 volume.
Also, if you had a lot of books to
get, you might have to make two or
three round trips. By the way,
‘tho, it would be a lot of fun at that.
But, why slips in the reserve book
room‘?

I’ve thought a lot about that
problem, but haven’t been able to
come to any ultimate solution, yet.
Still I have annotated a liali’ dozen
or so possible reasons. These are:

A. The University wants to be
sure we sign our tuition checks and
notes; thus this is but a subterfuge
to recheck on any possible forgery
or other such irregularity.

B. The University is expecting a
large number of refugee students
this spring. Rather than hire an
interpreter, they will have the for-
eign speaking students write out
what they want on the slips and
have modern language class proj-
ects on translating them.

C. The reserve book room work-
ers were becoming neurotic and
psychotic because they didn’t have
slips and more boxes of ﬁles, too.

D. The government of Liberia
in West Africa decided to have its
own nationality room; but the Uni-
versity ofﬁcials, due to bad hand-
writing or poor reading, thought it
was the Republic of Libraria which
wanted the room. Thus they de-
cided the Librarian room just had
to be well decorated with thousands
of time stamped and initialed li-
brary slips, since such slips are the
distinguishing thing about Librari-
ans as Pitt people know them.

I Keep Of the Grass Byeillitazefsky

Let’s go red-baiting:

We're beginning to worry about
Senator Ziskind, whose column
“Common Sense,” seems to call for
a. Confucius saying. The Senator
either eats pickles or reads Dorothy
Thompson before he adjourns to
bed.

Ziskind, casting his jaundiced eye
upon the American scene, came up
with the American Com.munist.
“Stop tolerating him—-—cast him out,”
roared the non-purring Senator.
Ziskind was quite wrought up about
it.

Says Gerald, “These conniving
Communists, who have no country
but the Soviet Union, who have no
leader but Comrade Stalin, who
have no ﬂag but that of the ham-
mer and sickle, have no place in
American life.” Cautiously point-
ing out that we are even a secret
Communist, receiving secret in-
structions from Comrade Stalin by
carrier pigeon, we must hasten to
say tut, tut.

E. The night janitor here has
begun to drink while he’s all alone
and, consequently, the fu]_“1'1ac(-)3
often go out at night and waste
paper is needed in the morning to
rekindle them. The ordinary sup-
ply of wasted or used library slips
didn’t meet this exigency, thus to
get more cancelled slips and to keep
up the health of Pitt students, it
was necessary to use the reserve
book room, too.

F. The reserve book room has
been transferred to Mr. Quick and
the Registrar’s ofﬁce.

These are only a few possible
causes; and they do not seem satis-
factory. So, if anyone knows any
other possible solutions or even
probable explanations, I wish and
would be gratiﬁed to have him
communicate such to me. It is
urgent. '

D. D., C41.

‘Senator’ Ziskind

Takes a Beating

i;T.ditor, the Pitt News:

Gezald Ziskind, erstwhile uncom-
mon sense columnist, seems about
to go off the deep end.

Little Gerald is about to become
intolerant of the Communists; to-
morrow who knows. Maybe the
CIO, maybe the third partyites.

Gerald’s column on Monday was
full of glittering generalities, stuffed
with paradoxes, apparently inaccu-
rate in places, and contaminated not

a little by Allied propaganda. And
so I’m answering it.
I will deﬁne the issues. Uncle

Gerald will no longer tolerate the
Communists: their interest is in the
Russian interpretation, not the Al-
lied-American; so the hell with
them. He will not tolerate their
views of the war, even though they
are minority opinion. The Com-
munists are disturbing in France, in
Sweden, and in the Unitel States;
they don’t want to go along with
majority opinion. The Communist
is no longer able to change our so-
cial system and at the same time re-
main honest and sincere to his pa-
triotic duty.

Pull up your ﬁreside, Gerald, and
we’ll chat. Of course you will have
to tolerate the Communists, and for
several reasons. 1—suppressing

Letters to the Editor

one political party leads to further
suppression; 2-very few students
know enough to try to be intolerant
of anything; 3-—-past history is too
full of intolerance to ever trust its
effectiveness.

Minority opinions have been of
considerable value to America both
in the past and present; they must
be tolerated. Especially in this pe-
riod of stress minorities will act as
counter reactions to enlightened ma-

jorities. The constant play of op-
posing forces is democracy’s only
safeguard.

Of course the Communists don’t
have only the United States’ interest
at heart; even you should know that
national boundaries have always
meant very little to them. Look at
Earl Browder.

And certainly you know what fol-
lowing the party line means; Dem-
ocratic, Communistic, or Republi-
can. Besides you don’t seem to
have grasped the party line on Fin-
land. It might be a good idea to get
hold of a pamphlet and analyze the
party line for us students in a col-
umn. But analyze, don’t orate. You
seem to have a fairly good under-
standing of Allied propaganda, now
expose yourself on the left side.

And as far as “patriotic duty”
goes, that cliche has been used so
many times as an emotional stimu-
lus in the wrong way that it is no
longer valid, even for attacking rad-
icals.

Now for some constructive propo-
sals. Examine the war propaganda
of the allies more carefully. A cou-
ple of French releases you used
sounded a little ridiculous. Before
the last war few people were care-
ful in this way, so that many orators
told many lies about many things.

Then too you might attack the
Communists for what they believe
rather than what their enemies say
they believe. Tolerance has pro-
vided plenty of evidence for an ac-
tive examination of Communism.
And please don’t be so damn gen-
eral. List the
rather broad statements. Be more
accurate, less oratorical, and clearer.

“We must stop tolerating the
American Communists?” Speak for
yourself, Uncle Gerald.

JACK DE BENEDICTIS, C42.

sources of your ~

Gerald, like many vociferous 100
per cent Americans (which is dan-
gerously like the “pure Aryan”
motif) is making much ado about
nothing. This red menace is about
as serious as the yellow menaceof
the early thirties. Dangerous is the
Scnator’s idea about “no longer tol-
crating.”

You can’t compromise with dem-
ocracy. Start casting out one group
and you’vc committed yourself to a
policy of earning civil liberties. It’s
easy to slap a movement in the face
with a red herring. Start bandying
around a word like un-American,
and you get in the habit of pinning
“un-American” upon things with
which you disagree.

The Senator, in his red purge,
tossed a condescending paragraph
or two at the American Youth Con-
gress. At one time, as the Senator
put it, the Congress was motivated
by the Communists. Whether or
not the Congress refused to ex-
press sympathy for Finland because
Moscow said “nix” is a matter of
which we’re not certain. We’re
waiting until we get a complete re-
port of the proceedings.

There is a deﬁnite need for an
American Youth Congress. But the
Congress must be representative
and include groups like the “Y” ’s,
the Young Democrats and Republi-
cans, various religious groups, and
student groups.

Senator. there is a war being
fought. Those skids on which a
couple million young Americans
may slide into war are being
greased. The whole idea of intoler-
ance, which starts off with your
idea of red-baiting, sounds a little
greasy to us."

One of the chief reasons for the sudden swing to the local r_':;-imp

is Bullet Bill Carter, Negro sopho-
morbe sensation, who equalled the
NYAC games 80 yard dash record
two weeks ago and the Pitt ‘track
house record last week.

Stickel Also Sprint Favorite

Hap Stickel, the other member
of the great sophomore sprinting
duo, lies not been given the public-
ity his illustrious teammate has,
but latest dope from practices on
the hill indicates that both boys
will be in the thick of the sprinting
battle tomorrow night.

Barney Ewell, Penn State star, is
cast in the role of favorite for the
ICAAAA 60 yard dash by track ob-
servers. However with Ken Clapp
of Brown, Stickel, and Carter in the
race he will have to make record
time to bear out advance predic-
tions.

Carter, 1\3‘l‘ll Broad Jump Hopes

Ewell and Carter also will ﬁght
for broad jumping honors. Carter’s
mark of 23 feet eight and a half
inches is better than any of Ewe1l’s

Eastern collcgians  ‘e also been
notably weak in the high hurdles
this year. Joe Newman, Pitt junior
lettermen, is much improved over
last year and seems a sure place
winner in the 60 yard high iZ,‘L1l‘2.'l€1‘S.

Also holder of a new indoor rec-
ord, Johnny Bazyk. senior shoi;put-
fer, will figure in the scoring. Al
Blozis, Georgetown sophomore, who
has shattered practically all exist-
ing 16 pound shot put mar s this
winter: has the first place medal in
the bag. Ba::yk’s competition cent-
ers in the battle with Ed Beetem,
Pennsylvania sophomore and second
place hope.

Long on event that has furnish-
ed Pitt points in dual meets, but
never strong in the  competi-
tions, the polt vault is also a possi-
ble pr-:.:ducer of an lCA.'-XAA place.

he, too, must be counted in on the

The high jump marks in the East
of collegiate leapers this winter
have been none too impressive with
the exception of those of Artie
Byrnes, Manhattan ace. Therefore,
Dave McDowell, new Pitt indoor
high jump king, should be no worse
than second.

its March tests.

Jerks Flatten
NewInan.s, 32-H ,
In Title Match

 new independent champion was
crowned Wednesday afternoon on
the Trees floor when the Jerks
swamped the defending Newman
five by a 32-11 score‘.

Both teams displayed plenty of
rough basketball with numerous
fouls called on both teams. Each
quintet lost a man through the per-
sonal foul route. Joe Dunn had
the maximum number of penalties
for the Ncwmans and Bob Malloy
was charged with four for the Jerks.

The defending title holders were
so closely guarded that they were
unable‘ to register a field goal until
over six minutes had elapsed in the
second half. Until this time the
Newmans had scored all their points
from the foul line

Bennett tallied the first two point-
ers for the losers when he evaded
the entire Jerks’ defense and scored
at close range. The second and
third Newman field goals were reg-
istered by Bennett and Lohmeyer.

Center Anania of the Jerks paced
the scorers by tallying 10 points
with teammates Malloy and Jack
Stetler close behind with eight each.

The Jerks counted on a fast
charging defense to bottle up the
‘Newman offense. Apparently un-
accustomed to these tactice, the 105-
ers frequently were guilty of wild
passing.

At half time the new champions
led by a 14-3 score’, mainly on
baskets registered by Malloy and
Stetler.

The defeat stopped the Newman
club from recording their second
successive independent basketball
championship as well as putting an.
end to all hopes for a return match
The Phi Kaps
topped the Newmans in a playoff

last season.

Basketball Team Gpposes Penn

State after Win

Cagcrs Face Lions

At State College

Pitt bumps against Penn State’s
sliding zone defense for the second
time this season when the Panther-
men play Johnny Lawther’s Lions
on the State College court tomor-
row evening. Earlier in the season
the Pitt ﬁve opened their home cam-
paign by tripping State, 31-28.

Lawther’s boys will be out to even
up things with the unpredictable
Panthers, who turned in somewhat
of an upset in the first game.

Both squads will hold to their
particular style of play, the Panth-
ers continuing to use the ﬁgure
eight offense and an undescribable
defense, and the Lions banking on a
stiff defense and a quick break of-‘
fense.

Pitt’s two point getters, Eddie
Straloski and Mel Port, paced the
Panthers in their last game with
the State ﬁve, the former garnering
11 points while the latter netted
ﬁve.

Straloski, Kocheran, Port, Milan-
ovich, and Pataky or Ptacek proba-
bly will make up the starting Pitt
ﬁve. State followers are expecting
to see McWilliams, Racusin, Barr,
Sapp, and Moffat in the opening
line-up.

Coldspots Defeat
Polar Bears, 33-30

After spotting the Polar Bears
nine points in the ﬁrst half, the un-
defeated Coldspots made a deter-
mined second half comeback last
Wednesday to triumph, 38-39, in the
freshman Polar league.

The Polar Bears took an early
lead which they held until the sec-
ond half when Reifer, Goldsmith,
and Jameson combined to take the
lead.

Red Silverman led the Polar
Bears with 10 points and played the
outstanding game for the losers.

Morty Reifer played brilliant ball
for the Coldspots. Outstanding as a
defenseman he also helped indirect-
ly in the scoring with his clever
passing.

Goldsmith led the victors in scor-
ing honors as he netted 11 points.

Panthers Smother

Fordham Five, 57-37

Cutting loose with a early sec-
ond half ﬂurry, the Pitt basketball
team won going away from Ford-
ham Wednesday evening, 57-"7.

Ed Straloski and Mel Port, point
making standbys, each contributed
14 points to the winners’ total,
while Jack Scherer trailed with
10. The Rams divided their scoring
equally among four men,

The lead see-sawed back and
forth during the first half until the
score reached 18-18. Then Stra-
loski connected with a ﬁeld goal,
and from there on the Panthers
were never headed.

Pitt went on a scoring rampage
when the second half opened, and
upped the score from 28-23 to 42-
25 before the Rams were able to
cool them off.

The victory put the Panthers
above the .500 level again with
eight wins and seven losses. With
two more games on the schedule,
Penn State tomorrow and West Vir-
ginia next Saturday, Pitt must take
both to ﬁnish with a better record
than last year when the Carlson-

Potts Extends
Entrance Date
For Bowling

Intramural director James Potts
has extended the deadline for the
entrance of teams in the all-campus
bowling tournament to Monday,
March 4, to accomodate a number
of men who were unable to get in
under the original line. Bowling
will begin on Wednesday, March 6.

Although the tourney will par-
allel the intramural p1ay—off, there
is no connection with intramural
standings or championships. The
idea of the affair is to provide some
action during the lull between the
Winter and Spring programs and,
to satisfy the demands of the men
who wished to continue bowling
after the intramural session ceased.

Participation in all-campus bowl-
ring is unlimited. The tournament is
open to any University men who
want to organize a team of four
men and two alternates. Previous
action in the intramural league
bowling is not an entrance require-
ment.

Schedules for the first day’s ac-
tion wlll be printed in the News.

Wednesday inarked the ﬁl'Sl'.
round of the intramural bowling
clouble-elimination play-offs as the
Amity Club slowed up the PiKAs
by taking two out of three games.
Today the Pl1‘{As meet the loser of
the Aniity-lndimtrial contest.

that the “friendliness and informal-
ity” among the students impressed
her most of all; she liked their man-
ner better than the “old” ways in
Buenos Aires. “They appear so
content,” she remarked.

She used “modern” and “big”
frequently in contrasting the Ca-
thedral with any of the South
American buildings. The only ex-
pressive English word that she
could find to describe her Spanish
concept of the F‘ick Acres was
“beautiful.”

Basketfull of A’s

A change in scenery apparently
turned the trick for ﬁve former
classmates at the University‘s Erie
Center, for the same quintet set a
new record in scholarship on the
University’s campus last semester.

Carrying a total of 93 credits, of
an average of more than 18 credits
each during the semester, a group
of five maintained “A”
:_£;rades in all their courses, with the
exception of one two-credit course.

Three of the ﬁve are enrolled in
the School of Engineering. Thom-
as Trocki, W'illiam R. Shaffer, and
James Bateman all had straight
“A” grades. Trocki and Shaffer
each carried 191» credits and Bate-
man had 187.».

Alfred Schnur, Ed, was the other
solid “A” student. Black sheep of
the group was Ralph Parkman, M,
who maintained an “A” average in
only 16% of his 181»-credit load.
His other grade was a “B.”

In the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway, Franconia Notch, N- H.’ Bob Bourdon (450110)
enjoys a slow-burning Camel. “No speed for me in my smoking," Says this ski champion.
“Camels are slower-burning and give me extra mildness, extra coolness, and extra flavor.”

Q

‘ HE faster the going, the more fun in skiing,”
says Bob Bourdon. But he has a different angle
on cigarettes. When Bob Bourdon says: “Slow burn-
ing is my guide to more mildness, more coolness,
and more flavor,” he’s putting the stamp of actual
smoking experience on the ﬁndings of science.
Fast burning in a cigarette means beat. Nothing
dulls the delicate elements of cigarette ﬂavor and
aroma so surely as excess heat. There’s little pleasure

 

or comfort in a hot, ﬂat smoke in which the ﬂavor
has been burned away. The extra mildness, refresh-
ing coolness, and that smooth, mellow ﬂavor of
Camels are conﬁrmed by recent widely reported
scientiﬁc tests,‘ in which Camels...the cigarette of
costlier tobaccos . . . burned the slowest of the sixteen
of the largest-selling brands tested! (See panel at
left.) So, change to slow-burning Camels and enjoy
extm pleasure and extra smoking.
