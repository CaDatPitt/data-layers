As the ﬁnal minutes before the BNY Mellon
eviction deadline expired, Occupy Pittsburgh
campers prepared for new shelters and raked
leaves at the muddy Mellon Green. But they
weren’t leaving.

“We have seven minutes until we are not leav-
ing!” someone shouted through a megaphone
that echoed through the camp.

The Occupy movement that sparked a na-

tional furor against corporate greed is starting .
to dwindle. Recent oustings in New York City '

and Los Angeles seem to predict the end of the
three—month protest. And Occupy Pittsburgh is
not exempt. On Friday, BNY Mellon delivered
an eviction notice to the group —— about eight
weeks after Occupy Pittsburgh settled into Mel-
lon Green. But campers refused to leave by the
Sunday deadline; instead, they declared seizure
of Mellon Green, renaming it “People’s Park,”
during a press conference that coincided with
the eviction deadline.

The Action working group of Occupy Pitts-
burgh will counter the eviction with one of its
own, serving BNY Mellon a notice at 8:30 a.m.
today that declares BNY Mellon is now trespass-
ing on “the land of the camp,” said Silas Russell,

27, of Mount Washington, who plans to sleep at _

the camp tonight.

Despite the eviction notice, the resilient
campers said they do not plan to leave the site.
About 100 campers, volunteers and support-
ers proceeded with the camps plans for win-
terization by sweeping leave‘-s, moving mud-

slathered wooden planksand tearing down .1

tents. The cleared area would be replaced with
yurts —— makeshift shelters made with foam
insulation.

But though the campers remain optimistic
that the camp will stand, they believe the move-
ment does not need the physical camp to express
the goals of the Occupy movement.

“The parkbelongs to no one and belongs to
everyone,”]e1"l'Cech, 28,.of Greenﬁeld, said.

There was no police presence at the camp
on Sunday.

The deadline passes J . ‘

The Occupy Pittsburgh movement _— an off-

r shoot of Occupy Wall Street, which began Sept.
17 — denounces corporate greed in America.
The Pittsburgh branch had amarch and rally
Oct. 15, then set up camp at Mellon Green on
Sixth Avenue and Grant Street. Occupy Pitts-
burgh has the only campsite on bank property
inthe country. _

Since the nationwide movement’s inception,
police have evicted and raided numerous camps

around thecountry. Occupy Wall Street was i

‘dismantled on Nov. 15 after a strategic police
raid that cleared Zuccotti Park in New York

Occupiers don’t anticipate forceful eviction

City and resulted in 200 arrests. Police cleared
Occupy Philadelphia at Dilworth Plaza on Nov.
30, arresting 52 people. .

Rumors of a possible eviction began circulat-
ing within the Pittsburgh camp last week. '

Despite the collapse of the other camp sites,
the Occupy Pittsburgh movement vows to per-
severe despite BNY Mellon’s pressure.

“VVe’re going to deal with the adversity as
it comes,” Bram Reichbaum of the North Side
said. “I haven’t. heard people say, ‘We’re going
skedaddle now.’ We would be doing the move-
ment a disservice if we acquiesced.”

, BNY Mellon issued an eviction notice Friday
to Occupy Pittsburgh, saying thatwhile the com-

" pany respects the efforts of the organization, it

is concerned with the onset of winter.

“These concerns are heightened by reported
incidents ofhypothermia and the use of propane
heaters, gasoline—powered generators and other
ﬂammable devices in the conﬁned spaces of
tents,” the eviction notice said. “We are also
concerned about hazardous conditions created
by any accumulation of snow and ice on the
property, which in previous years has led us to
close BNY Mellon Green altogether in winter
months.” A ~ '

Cech said there haven’tbeen any problems in p

the camp, nor incidents that would raise health
concerns. _ . ,

BNY Mellon required that the campers re-
move all of their property by noon on Sunday.

If the occupiers remain at Mellon Green, the
action will be considered unlawful trespass.
BNY Mellon will ﬁle an injunctive relief with
the court on Monday, which means the judicial
authority will handle the problem of the occupa-
tion’s existence.

According to Pennsylvania law, deﬁant tres-
pass, deﬁned as remaining in a place where
“notice against trespass is given,” can be a mis-
demeanor or a summary offense. 4

BNY Mellon spokeswoman Lane Cigna de-
clined to comment on the occupiers’ ‘current
presence on the bank’s property and what will
happen if they do not leave. -

After the noon deadline passed, many 0
the occupiers continued to go forth with the
winterization process, which includes cleaning
up the camp and building yurts.

Celest Taylor, 55, of Point Breeze, said there
is still work to be done at the camp.

“We’re not going to give [BNY Mellon] any
less excuses,” she said, referring to .the occupi-
ers’ efforts to compromise with BNY Mellon’s
eviction notice. '

The occupiers removed all gas-powered gen- ‘

erators and propane heaters to comply with
BNY Mellon’s concerns. Cech said the yurts,
which will include medical tents that have vol-
unteer nurses, will remedy health and safety
concerns. Cech said campers will have to de-
termine how long they can sustain themselves
outside before seeking shelter in their homes

John McNulty, 47, played “Taps” as the camp-
ers raised a second American flag at the _camp.
McNulty, who laminated his protesting posters
to bear the harsh weather, said he is considering
setting up a residence at the camp.

“What they’re doing is awesome, peaceful .

and nonviolent,” he said.
The importance of the movement ‘
BNY Mellon issued its eviction notice on

the same date that the Pittsburgh City Council’

issued a proclamation alliance.

“Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Coun-
cil of the City of Pittsburgh does support and de-
clare solidarity with Occupy Pittsburgh and the
Occupy Wall Street movement, exercising First

. Amendment rights in afree, open, peaceful and

productive manner, toward the better condition
of our citizens and of these United States,” the
proclamation on City Council’s website states.
Justin Ellsworth, 30, a member ofthe United
Steelworkers, came to the camp to show support
and a lend a hand  the cleaning in light of
the eviction deadline. He‘ believes BNY Mellon
willﬁle the injunctive reliefto force the occupiers

» out. Ellsworth isn’t surehow much City Council’s

declaration will affect how the eviction goes.

“It’s hard to say if the patience will last,”
Ellsworth said, referring to BNY Mellon and
the police. _

Mel Packer, 66, of Point Breeze, said remov-
ing tents will not stop the movement.

“You cannot evict an idea,” he said, aphrase

’ that has become an 0ccupy_ motto in light of

evictions. As the evictions continue, the occu-

piers want people to know the camp does not '
necessarily need to exist for their complaints _

to be heard. ‘ V
. Neal Bisno, the president of Service Employ-
ees International Union Healthcare Pa., said

there is a “long history_of people ﬁghting for

justice,” citing the Greensboro sit—ins and the
Vietnam protesters. ' . -
"‘These movements didn’t goaway,” Bisno
said during a press conference. “We’ll be here
today, we’llbe here tomorrow, we’llbe here until
we get the justice we deserve.” T
John DeFa_zio, the directorof the United

- Steelworkers in Allegheny County, said USW

supports the movement.

Members of the movement said they don’t
anticipate a violent or forceful removal of the
occupiers in the nextfew days because they geta
sense there is support from the community.

" “This is a small town,” said Will Flynn, 25,
of Point Breeze, who has slept at the camp a
few times. “If [the police] show up.with tear
gas and riot gear, then'it’s like, ‘Oh, these are
our neighbors?’ C ”

Taylor, who shares a tent with several other
women, said it’s important to be passive.

“Now is not the time to be fearful,” she
said about the possibility of police raiding the
camp. It ' '

Many burglaries occur
during winter break

Mary Mallampalli

Stajffwriter

Sophomorejenny Hempen answered a pan-
icky phone call from her roommate around
1 a.m. on Sunday, Nov. 27 — only to ﬁnd out
that over Thanksgivingbreak, her Oakland
apartment had been burglarized. '

“I deﬁnitely didn’t think this would hap-
pen, especially to us. It’s a running joke in
our apartment about how safe we thought
our apartment was,” said Hempen, an‘urban
studies major. “We have security bars on all
our windows and locks on all the doors. We
never thought this would happen.”

. Unfortunately for students living in
Oakland, stories like Hempen’s are all too
common. According to the Campus Crime

there were 46 burglaries
on campus and in the sur-
rounding Oakland area in
2010 — nearly triple the
amount in 2009, when 16
burglaries were reported
to the University police and
University ofﬁcials. The
crime at Hempen’s apart-
ment was the only reported
burglary in Oakland during
Thanksgiving break. ~
Hempen lives with two
roommates in a house that '
is split into three apart-
ments on North Belleﬁeld
Avenue. One of her room-
mates Worked late Satur-

day night, and she returned home to the I

girls’ apartment early Sunday morning to
ﬁnd closet doors open, liquor bo_ttles lay-
ing all around their hallway and the girls’
bedrooms completely ransacked.

‘All of our rooms were totally trashed.
It looked like a tornado had gone through
there,” Hempen said. The roommate im-
mediately called the police after notifying
Hempen and her other roommates about
the situation.

“She was very upset. It was actually very
dramatic,” Hempen said. “The police had
to go around the corners [of the apartment]
with a gun to make sure the guy wasn’t still
there.” I

With the increased number of burglaries
over thepast two years, Pitt police stress the
importance of securing apartment doors and
windows before students leave for winter
break.

“Our advice to students is to secure all
their valuables before leaving. They should
make sure all windows and doors are se-
cured, not only during the holidays, but at all
times,” Oﬂicer Ron Bennett of the Pitt police
said. “We also encourage them to report any

All of our

, rooms 
were totally

trashed. 

-‘Jenny Hempen

 

suspicious activity to our department at 412-
624-2121 or, if they’re not on University prop-
erty, 911 for the City of Pittsburgh P.D.”

Bennett said that the Pitt police have a
continuous working partnership with the
city police to ensure the safety of students
and the Oaklandcomrhunity.

Hempen said the police_believe the in-
truder worked the security bars off the front
windows, pushed the window air conditioner
through with a hammer and crawled through
the hole in the safety bars to break in through
the front window of theiapartment.

Hempen’s Thanksgiving break. ended
abruptly when shelhad to return to Oak-

, land with her mother th_e.next day to be ,

present while investigators dusted for ﬁn-
gerprints throughout the apartment. When
she arrived, she found that laptops, cash,
jewelry,‘her camera and
other easily removable
electronics had been
stolen. _

‘-‘The ﬁnger—printing
wasn’t-very productive,
and we ,didn’t really
expect it to be. There’s
an investigation pend-
ing now,'but we’ll see,”
Hempen said. “We’re
just trying to get over
it now. Everyone in the
three apartments [in
our building] hasbought
security systems [since
the burglary]. We just

bought ours two days .

Junior Dominique Hess was the victim

of a burglary last December, when intrud-

ers broke into her apartment on Neville
Street. ‘

“It was scary. I cried. Itwas just scary to
think that someone came in like that and
came in through the bedroom window,” Hess
said. Luckily for Hess and her roommate,
the intruder broke in while they were both
out. I

Hess, who studies dental hygiene, lost
her laptop in the burglary. .

“I would suggest checking all the windows
before you move inanywhere. My dad went
out [after the break—in] and bought deadbolts
for my windows’ to make sure that they were
secure,” Hess said.

After the‘incident, Hess installed an _

alarm system that hooked on the back door
of_ the apartment in thelhope that it would
scare away potential intruders.

Although students will be clearing their
minds of papers, projects and ﬁnal exams

as soon as they leave Pitt’s campus for win— '

ter break, th'e Pitt police will continue to
patrol throughout the Oakland area 24/7,
Bennett said. I '

Final—exams schedule set according to system

Josh Won
For The Pitt News

To all of those students who have won-
dered why they get stuck with a ﬁnal‘ on
the ‘last day of ﬁnals week: It’s not ran-
dom.

According to Daniel Stump, Pitt’s

V manager of course and class scheduling,

the University schedule works around a
rotation-based formula organized by the
Ofﬁce of the University Registrar, which
focuses on staggering exams throughout
ﬁnals week for each department,

Patti Mathay, the associate registrar,
said the University registrar begins con-
structing the ﬁnals schedule four weeks
prior to the end ofa previous, term, .soher

 already    r  
‘ fOf:'»Pit;t’s‘Spring;te;rii1ﬁnalsiffi s "  

 * “Over the course of a’ few weeks’,  ‘-
of the schedule is created, reviewed and

then revised as necessary,” she said. “Our
goal is to have it available on our website
before the start of the term.” ‘ A

After the start of a newterm, the room
scheduling for ﬁnal exams begins, and
classroom waiver forms and special re-

This is done so the University registrar

The student must then approach in-

If instructors will not provide a more
accommodating exam time, the instruc-
tor of the course in the middle time slot
between the other two examinations must
reschedule this exam for the student, un-
less it is a departmental exam, in which
case the instructor of the course with the
lowest enrollment must provide an alter-
nate exam time.

Exceptions aside, the University’s Final»

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN ‘OF AMERICA

The Moustache Column’s peeps of the year

 
 
 
 

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

vAh, the end of the year. In ad-

dition to bombing the ﬁnals in
those “cake” or “blow-off” classes
you’ve been avoiding all semester,
hunkering down to watch season
two of “Veronica Mars” while sip-
ping hot cocoa and wearing loose
sweatpants and thermal socks and
trying not to have even a minute’s
worth of serious conversation
with your parents, now is the time
to take stock of those tastemakers
and newsmakers who made 2011
such a memorable year — or at
least more memorable than other
years, such as 2004 and 1998, that
you can’t remember as well.
Here, then, is the Moustache
Column of America’s contribu-
tion to this wonderful period of

short-term memory creation: K

our totally subjective list of the
dawgs, bros, homeboys, freaks of
nature, tween idols, ballers and
drama queens who made the past

365 days so gr8 that they actually '

wound up being gr9.
Tim Tebow (baller): This man’s
name appears almost everywhere

-— including as part of the lower—_

back tattoo we’re going to spend
the next decade of our life living
down — and it’s likely that you’re
going to hear even more about him
as he begins to master the basic
skills, such as throwing overhand,
that other top NFL quarterbacks
like T.J. Yates, Curtis Painter and
legendary former Pitt star Tyler
Palko already possess. Our pre-
diction: Super Bowl or bust!
Ashton Kutcher (bro): Sure,

A “Two and a Half Men” was already

terrible when Chuck Sheen was
on it. But did you watch the ﬁrst
episode of Kutcher’s run on this
series, during which the emascu—
latedJon Cryer was forced to read
a bunch of lines about how big his
new BFF’s package was? On top of
that, he’s allegedly been cheating
on his ancient spouse with nearly
every person on the planet. The
critics agree: three stars.

The Kardashians (drama
queens): There are a whole bunch
of these people — have you heard
about them? According to the
glossy magazines that are sold
at the CVS checkout counter,
they’ve been getting married
to NBA players, divorcing NBA

players, going on fad diets, go-
ing off fad diets, falling in love
with their big bottoms, resigning
themselves to having big bottoms
but being pleased with how their
fad diets are reducing the size of
their big bottoms, and the like.
Their mother, who is now mar-
ried to a legendary Olympian
who has himself undergone some
legendary plastic surgery, is_ as
inexplicably popular as Republi-
can front-runner Newt Gingrich.
Highly recommended.

Justin Bieber (tween idol): Ac-
cording to last week’s In Touch
magazine, Bieber wears “women’s
jeans because they ﬁt me.” He’s
also been battling accusations
that he fathered a child, which
seems unlikely for a variety of
reasons (refer to the first sen-
tence in this paragraph for one
ofthem). In spite ofhis troubles,
Biebs still sports a beautiful bowl
cut that calls to mind those cutie
pies from the Tim Allen—fronted
sitcom “Home Improvement.”
Simply delightful.

John Cena (homeboy): Why

does wrestling impresario Vince
McMahon continue to think
that jean shorts paired with Ed
Hardy-style shirts and a wallet
chain equals awesome? Notwith-
standing Vince’s bizarre aesthet-
ic — which is best described as
one clueless 60-year-old man’s
futurist vision of what redneck
mouth-breathers would ﬁnd cool
in the year 2000, as determined
from the vantage point of 1984
'— Cena has distinguished him-
self by becoming one of the least
likable “faces,” or good guys, in
the history of sports entertain-
ment. Also: Isn’t it amazing that
anyone, ourselves included, still
watches pro wrestling? Our stock
tip: Sell.

Newt Gingrich (you’re the man
now, dawg): Gingrich, who earned
a Ph.D. in history from Tulane
University in the 1970s and then
proceeded to forget everything he
learned, is leading one of the most
lackluster packs of Republican
candidates since former Kansas
governor Alf Landon lapped the
ﬁeld at the 1936 GOP Convention.

Boasting a blobby physique, big
white hair and a willingness to use
inaccurate historical examples to
make_his points, Gingrich, who
once seemed as eradicable as
smallpox, has proven to be every
bit as ineradicable as smallpox

(which is making a comeback).
_ Now, thanks to the endorsement

of noted “loose cannon” Herman
Cain — the cheap-pizza magnate
who allegedly loves his mistresses
and the number 45 in equal mea-
sure — the sky’s the limit for 01’
Newt. Keep an eye on him.
Wesley Warren Jr. (natural
wonder): Warren, a 47-year-old
man with testicles that weigh well
over 100 pounds, went on How-
ard Stern’s radio show seeking
money to pay for an experimental
surgery that would reduce the size
of his gonads while allowing him

to remain sexually active. Castra-

tion wasn’t an option, he told an
interviewer -— this 300-pounder
is still in the prime of his life. The
Jay Leno punchline: With balls like
these, Warren should be running
for president.

On any “best of” list like this,
plenty of deserving people will
wind up missing the cut. We wish
we had the space to honor big stars
like Madden 2012 cover model
Peyton Hillis, San‘ Diego Char-
gers coach Norv Turner, extreme
cleaning specialists and the other
phlegmatic types who shovel up

- all the cat feces on“Hoarders,”

whoever the current “Bachelor”
is (former Giants quarterback
Jesse Palmer, maybe?), but we
just don’t. Better luck next year,

EDITORIAL

Subject Pitt to Right-
to-Know regulations

In August 2007, former Penn State Presi-
dent Graham Spanier lobbied legislators to
exempt his university and Pennsylvania’s
three other state-related schools from the
Right—to—Know Law, which ‘grants public
access to various college ﬁnancial records
(such as contracts, employee compensation
data, receipts and vendor agreements).

“Subjecting Penn State to Right-to-
Know does far more than feed the pruri-
ent interests of newspaper editors who
are looking for a headline about how much
Coach [Joe] Paterno makes,” Spanier tes-
tiﬁed, arguing that the bill would erode
employee morale andgcost the University
millions of dollars. Unfortunately, Spanier
won: Currently, Pitt, Penn State, Temple
and Lincoln are required to disclose only
certain IRS information and the salaries
of their officers, directors and 25 highest-
paid employees.

Now, however, ‘both Paterno and Spanier
have been ousted, and the public is clamor—
ing for access to documents relevant to the
alleged Jerry Sandusky cover—up.

Representative Eugene DePasquale (D-
York County) has capitalized on this pres-
sure; his newly introduced House bill 2051,
which would subject state-related schools
to more Right—to—Know regulations, has
already garnered widespread, bipartisan

We applaud DePasquale’s efforts; his bill

,— and a similar Senate version, scheduled

to hit the ﬂoor soon — would beneﬁt Pitt’s
community as much as Penn State’s.

Our University, as you might have no-
ticed, has a transparency problem. Earlier
this year, we reported that Pitt instituted

a 2 percent budget cut across all 600 of
its units, but certain department chairs
didn’t even know their ﬁnances had been
affected. I

Under the Right—to—Know Law, we could i

better understand the particulars of the cut:
How many employees were terminated and
what services were eliminated.

Indeed, more comprehensive openness

standards are long overdue. Revealing Pitt’s

ﬁnancial records would legitimize Universi- A

ty tuition hikes, allow various departments
to showcase sound spending measures and,

most importantly, open administrators to h
' criticism.

In much the same way scholars present
theiriﬁndings for external critique, Pitt
could drastically improve its eﬂiciency and

. integrity with public feedback.

Chancellors and presidents need not
regard an open records policy with trepi-
dation or suspicion, of course. Much less
can be hidden from them, after all, when
media'outlets scrutinize their subordinates’
spending decisions and hiring records.

As for complaints that releasing ﬁnan-
cial data would undermine employee mo-
rale, this is simply not the case. Michelle
Fryling, an IUP spokesperson, told the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that, to the best
of her knowledge, the Right—to—Know Law
hasn’t affected faculty retention.

For the above reasons,-we hope this bill
continues to enjoy bipartisan support, fol-
lowed by swift passage — not simply be-
cause we’d like the Sanduskyinvestigation
to proceed smoothly, but also because Pitt
has exploited its open-records exemption
for far too long. -

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

One of the things that makes our country
so great is that we have the freedom to make
all kinds of choices. We can choose our re-
ligion, political beliefs and, recently, we’ve
even been allowed to change our sex.

The dark side of all this choice is that
we can be judged for the choices we make.
That is why I take offence to Tracey Hick-
ey’s Dec. 9 article, “Shaming Fat People
Misguided.” To suggest that weight and
race are similar is an insult to the various
minorities.who have been mistreated for
something that they cannot control, i.e. the
color of their skin or the deity they wor-
ship. Weight, though, is something that can
be controlled through discipline and hard
work. An abundance of research makes a
simple connection: fewer calories mean
less weight. '

Ms. Hickey’s use of studies that mention
the damaging effects of “yo-yo dieting”
skates dangerously close to unethical, as
the authors of these studies, in my experi-
ence, conclude by stating that their results
should not be used as a condemnation of
dieting in general but-instead as an indica-
tion that the overweight should always be
watching what they eat.

Getting a subtle tattoo, just like eating
dessert in moderation, is ﬁne. Covering
yourself with tattoos, though, invites peo-
ple to draw unpleasant conclusions about
your character. Obesity does the same. As
Roman dramatist Terence said, “Modera—
tion in all things” —— advice that I think our
society needs to take to heart.

‘Finals got you down? These sometimes-

cumulative, behemoth exams are the bane
of every college student’s life. More impor-

_ tantly, they’re a pesky barrier between ﬁn— l

ishing your semester and going home to
awkward interactions with your former high
school friends.

' The following is a list of consolations that
will hopefully inspire you to keep struggling

I don’t know about you, but nothing
motivates me like positive reinforcement.
Regardless of whether I get three or four

you’re disappointed
that you failed calcu-
lus for the third time,
think about how good-
you’re going to look

the holidays are over
and you’ve watched
your Blu-ray version

remember those silly aspirations.

If material possessions don’t improve
your spirits, just make a New Year’s resolu-
tion to pay more attention to your studies
next year. Nothing says “I’m a person who
has a serious need for closure as I am desper-
ate to believe things are going to be different
next year” than a New Year’s resolution.

This is the Last Exam You Will Have to

If you truly despise a class, take comfort
in the knowledge that you will never have to
take another exam or write another paper

for it again. Sure, that art class might have .

dragged on longer than the “Twilight” se-
ries, but at least you’ll never have to subject
yourself to writing critiques of Renoir again.
If worse comes to worse and you actually fail
the ﬁnal exam, try burning the textbook; it’ll
bring satisfaction, not be dramatic at all and
demonstrate mo re restraint than setting the

you’re enough of a television geek, you can
spend one day laughing at sitcoms like “The

dark watching dramas like “The Walking
Dead” or “Dexter” and one day affirming that
no matter how badly you screwed up your

GPA, your life will be better than those of the 1

reality TV stars on “Teen Mom,” “Made” and

the same as Wawa and a

lWhether it’s at your
grandmother’s house or
an old playground, feelings of nostalgia can
help you relax after a stressful two weeks
of ﬁnal exams. Though the stress and ten-
sion of studying might seem overwhelming
right now, take comfort in the fact that those
negative feelings will be a thing of the past
once you regress back to childhood dreams.
If you’re in a state of pure panic after failing
three ﬁnals in three days, try going home and
playing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
or Final Fantasy VII for six hours in a row.
I dare you to still be sad and apprehensive
about grades after “pwning no0bs” on Halo
2’s multiplayer via Xbox Live.

Of course, the important thing is to keep
everything in perspective. While ﬁnals seem
awful, unfair and stressful, bear in mind
that being an undergrad at Pitt is inﬁnitely
better and less stressful than being in the
graduate, law or medical school you plan
on eventually attending (provided you pass
these ﬁnal exams).

So suck it up and endure these two weeks
of hell with the knowledge that the next
semester could be the best four months of
your life. -

§WIMMI_NG AND DIVING

Freshmen play important role for Panthers

Dexter Gulick
Stajfwriter

In the sports world, there will always be com-
plaints aboutyoung teams. In many cases, the
gripes provide an excuse to faﬂ back on later
in the season, ‘should there be any disappoint-
ment. But with young talent comes great ex-
pectations, particularly in sports which aren’t
usually known for “one-and— done” athletes. -

Chuck Knoles, head coach of the Pitt’sswim
team, has had no issue handling a team with a
large crop of freshmen on board. The team is
sitting at a cool 4-2 in the Big East, having al-
readyfaced the toughest of their in-conference
opponents in their two losses to Louisville and
Notre Dame. '

“On the men’s side, we ended up having four
guys that all made their Trial Cuts between the
time we signed them and the time they showed
up,” Knoles said after practice Tuesday.

For the record, those are Olympic Trial Cuts
— and the U.S. has some of the fastest around.
The four to make the cut so far arejon Lierley,
who earned the honor in the 200 butterfly,

I Austin Caldwell (50 freestyle), Luke Nosbisch

(200 breaststroke) and Kourosh Ahani (100
butterﬂy).

“Kourosh Ahani can’t go to our Olympic
Trials because he’s from Canada,” Knoles said.
“Butthe.time he swam in the 100 ﬂy would have
made the U.S. Olympic Trials.”

His 48.12 in his race nets him the fastest
time on the Pitt team, the second—fastest time
in the Big East and the 33rd-fastest time in the
entire NCAA. And Ahaniwiﬂ be heading to se-
nior nationals and the Canadian Olympic Trials
with a cut in the 50-meter butterﬂy as well.

Fellow Canadians Danielle des Tombe and
Cam Dixon are also poised to go to nation-
als and Olympic Trials, held this upcoming
March in Montreal. Des Tombe heads in with
her 50-meter freestyle time, a.23.70. Dixon
will run the gamut, having qualiﬁed to swim
the 50-meter freestyle, ‘100-meter backstroke,
50-, 100- and 200-meterbreaststroke and the
200- and 400-meter individual medleys.

Tosay that the freshman class has had a
huge impact on the team’s success this year

‘ would be an understatement. Freshmen have

placed in the top three on the team 28 times.
During NCAA meets, only the top three swim-
mers from each team are scored. '
The freshmen hold sweeps in two events.
based on their times thus far this season. On
the men’s side, Ahani, Lierley. and Caldwell
round out the top three times in the 100—yard
butterﬂy. Des Tombe,Jessica Nederlanden and
Lauren Mills take the top three spots in the
women’s 50-yard freestyle. Much of the team’s
success comes_thanks to these freshmen, many
of whom have been incorporated into Pitt’s
fastest relay teams this season. Ahani has held
down the butterﬂy leg of the 400-meter medley
relay on the A-squad every meet thus far.
Nosbisch has also seen action in that re-
lay, splitting time on the breaststroke leg with
sophomore Rob Power and senior Ben Solari.

   

Des Tombe and Dixon are typically on the same
400 medley relay. In the Cincinnati meet, three
freshmen were featured in the women’s 200-
yard freestyle relay: Des Tombe, Lauren Mills
and Tatyanna Sarjeant. , ,
Despite their presence inthe water, the tran-

sition to collegiate swimming has taken some i

getting used to. “The ﬁrst couple weeks are kind
of weird, hearing all the times in yards,” Dixon
said after practice Tuesday. “I think to myself,

‘ ‘Whoa! I swam so fast!’ and then I remember

I’m in yards, not meters.”
Other difﬁculties have arisen simply from

the stark change in training regimen between
high school and the collegiate level. “I didn’t
do any weights,” Ahani said when asked what
the toughest change was. ‘fit was pretty tough
trying to get into the pool after lifting weights.
It was like your whole body was on ﬁre.”

The other three present, Lierley, Dixon and
des Tombe, echoed the sentiment. “I think the
weights thing is a new thing for all of us, and

especially racing every weekend,” said Lierley. ’

“We get up and do that every Friday.”
Shortly thereafter, des Tombe admitted
that in the previous year she’d only had to go

on board seems to be excited for the move.

said. “The competition is going to be great". '

pose of these unwanted presents.

our ideas, go online and share your

this holiday season, a scale is not

Box sets of music can be great

whelming quantities of songs by
an artist you don’t like. On the one

some groups without the desperate
search for one component at the
record store. The Misﬁts box set?
On my computer. But sometimes it
canjust be too much. Someone got
me the widely celebrated Beatles

box set a few years back, and it V
. was a little ‘too much. It’s a great

gift for most people and the giver
is very clear to me, but the Beatles
just aren’t my thing. So be careﬁil

thing a recipient might not use.

Don’t buy me perfume. I love
to wear perfume and I like when
others wear perfume minimally.
The problem is that, when you’re
gifted the stuff, someone else is
choosing your scent. The other day
in a store, I noticed categories for
perfume: ﬂirty, sporty, girly and
sensual. By choosing one of those

perfumes, I’d be choosing what
kind of girl I am. And, frankly, in
addition to that being my decision,
I also don’t particularly want a

well-intentioned aunt to tell me I’m '

“sensual.” So reconsider buying
perfume-— and especially avoid
the new smell-like-food trend and
anything that smells like cake.

clothing equivalent of coal.

Let’s face it — we all have problems. But
holidays are not exactly the perfect time
to reﬂect on and analyze everything that

could possiblylbe wrong with us by gift- .

ing self—help books. At least not to most
people. This is the one time of the year that
actually gives us a reason to be thankful for
existence, no matter what else is going on
in our lives. It’s a time to celebrate the most
valuable things in life, and getting a book
reminding you that you still have to face the
same issues once you’re back to “real life”
might put a slight damper on an otherwise
bright Christmas.

The supposed rise of 3-D television as the ‘

successor to HD (high-deﬁnition) hasn’t re-
ally made much headway with the American

_ public. Awkwardness deﬁnes the technol-

ogy’s position right now: If the glasses don’t
frustrate you, the prices will. Considering
the continuing economic downturn and the
switch to digital signaling in 2009, most
people are content with their current sys-
tems or can’t afford this developing technol-
ogy. Even though movie theaters still lure
viewers with 3-D features,this Christmas
won’t be the time to embrace the future in
your home unless you want to peer through
3-D glasses at your empty wallet.

Should you ﬁnd yourself looking for a
practical gift to give this holiday season,
I must caution you against anything that
you can ﬁnd in an office supply store. Book-
marks,_ pencils, highlighters and folders
might all seem like prudent items in the
spirit of giving, but they have a tendency
to come off as insensitive, impersonal ‘and,
frankly, boring. You would be amazed at
the disappointed looks that one gets when
giving a palate of multicolored cardstock
or a container of note cards. Now I know
what you are thinking: If only I pick up this
off—brand bottle of white-out, Granny will
one day, thank me when she ﬁnds herself
in need of the liquid paper.-.._Resist the urge.
People would much’ rather receive a gift card
than something to stock their desk with,

impractical as it might seem.

By Kirstin Kennedy

— Bear with me on this one. While it seems
like c1othing’s an easy and thoughtful gift —
hey, everybody needs clothes —— it’s secretly
a gift trap. Unless you know someone very

well, as in you frequently shop with them or A

are personally acquainted with the contents
of their closet, you’ll run the risk ofbuying
them something they hate. You’ll forever be

associated with the ugly sweater that they '

only wear when you’re around. You’ll be the

ugly—sweater friend.

If you must buy a person clothing, try to
subtly ask his or her size. If you try to guess
at it, you might end up offending by buying
a size too large — code for, “I think you’re
fatter than you actually are.” So don’t even
run the risk of forever offending a friend
through fashion. Just give them a gift card
to their favorite store or offer to go shopping
with them and pay for one or two items.

By Liz Keeney V '

Despite their popularity, gift cards are
often tacky and thoughtless rather than use-
ful. Gift cards are meant to be a way to help
their receiver get whatever he or she wants
from a favorite store. But giving loved ones
money and telling them to get whatever they

want sends the wrong kind of message: that y

the giver didn’t feel like putting effort into
actually ﬁnding or making the receiver a gift.
Plus, if you accidentally buy someone a gift
card for a store or restaurant they don’t like,

_ it ends up being the equivalent of throwing

away some of your own money when the gift
card is never used or when it’s re—gifted. So
although gift cards can be great for rare,
appropriate occasions, .try to avoid them
overall. Think of something more creative
— even a homemade Christmas card shows
more effort than a gift card.

So in about four or ﬁve days —— unless

you’re going to ﬁnish your last exam, and
you’re going to have a lot of time on your
hands. .

How should you ﬁll it‘? Sports!

The ﬁrst ofﬁcial day of break is Dec.

‘On Tuesday, Dec. 20, prepare yourself
for some nationally-televised Samford bas-
ketball! The Bulldogs, who hail from the
northern division of the Southern Confer-
ence, tip off at Kentucky at 7 p.m. on ESPN2.
Afterward, the network will televisethe

Butler Bulldogs at the Gonzaga Bulldogs, 1

which sounds like a joke but isn’t.

Had the NBA season started on sched-

ule, on Wednesday the Miami Heat would
have traveled to... are we not ﬁlling space
like this anymore? . _

Thursday, Dec. 22, features a lackluster
matchup between the Houston Texans and
Indianapolis Colts at 8:20

/ p.m. on NFL Network. The
handful of fans that have .
the NFL Network might
downgrade to basic cable
before the game.

necticut earlier this year
(losing by 12). The small-

 never mind, 'they’re
actually ‘from New York

vised games that feature the 10 franchises
that remained relevant through the previ-

Hockey comes out of the holiday strong
with 10 games on Dec. 26'. See for your-
self at 7 p.m. just how
far Alex Ovechkin and
the Washington Capi-
tals have fallen when
they square off against
the new-money Buffalo

On Tuesday, Dec.
27, the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team opens its
conference schedule at
Notre Dame at 7 p.m.
in what could be'the
program’s last Big East
game in South Bend. It
will not, however, be
the last time you hear,
“what could be the pro-
gram’s last Big East...”

- The women’s bas-
ketball team returns to campus a week
early to play Duquesne on Dec. 28. Don’t
feel too bad for them: The Panther women

travel to Cancun before Christmas to face .

Indiana and Michigan State in the Carib-
bean Classic on Dec. 20 and 21, respec-

tively. Lucky!

There are 63 Division I college basket.-,__

ball games scheduled for Thursday, Dec.
29: Catch Vanderbilt—Marquette, Florida-
Rutgers, Robert Morris—Memphis and
Harvard-Boston College. Skip Yale-Wake
Forest, Howard-Kansas and Citadel-Ten-
nessee.

With New Year’s Eve rapidly approach‘-‘
ing, the bowl schedule begins to swell with

‘ four games Friday and ﬁve Saturday. Unfor-

tunately, the most intriguing matchup —
feisty Virginia _vs. Auburn —— doesn’t kick
off until 7:30ip.m. on Dec. 31. Clearly New
Year’s plans will have to be adjusted.

New Year’s Day heralds the ﬁnal week of
the NFL regular season. It’s too soon to tell
which games will have playoff aspirations
on the-line, but Redskins vs. Dream T —-
ahem _— Eagles seems like a good bet.

 ’ ‘J'an.’2l"brings us outdoor hockey! The‘

Rangers skate with the Flyers at Citizenls
Bank Park in the 2012 Winter Classic.

On the last day of break, Michigan and
Virginia Tech battle at 8:30 p.m. in the
Sugar.Bowl. Keep in mind that these teams
are only in a BCS bowl because, well, Kan-

Energy drinks, lip balm alternative ways to ingest caffeine

Patrick Wagner
Staffwriter

52,52.‘ ., ....-_,_-,. .,..,-..

The darkly roasted coffee bean has long been
man’s source of a bit more energy, but the tra-
ditional “cup of Joe” is now being replaced by
patches, gum, drinks and even an inhaler. "
With study sessions, all—nighters and tired

‘weyes at hand, I decided to take a look at the bit-

ter substance that is humanity’s most widely
used psychoactive drug. Before getting to the
coffee though, there’s the matter of caffeine and
its relationship with a neurotransmitter called

adenosine. ,

“Adenosine is something that’s made by neu-
rons when tl1ey’re very active,” says Dr. Emily
Drill. A professor in the neuroscience depart-
ment, Drill pointed to the relationship this natu-
rally occurring substance has with caffeine.

“Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptor and

_ keeps it from inhibitingbrain activity,” Drill said.
“It inhibitsaninhibitor.” ,

What does that mean in layman’s terms‘?

“It increases activity in the brain,” Drill said.
Like methamphetamine and cocaine, caffeine
is a drug that improves brain and body ﬁmction
underaparticular set of circumstances. Amaxi—

mum daily intake is usually charted at around
300 milligrams — equivalent to approximately
three cups of regular coffee.

Unlike those relatively recently invented il-
legal stimulants, caffeine has beenused to extend
days into nights for avery long time.

The stimulant of the masses, caffeine in the 4

form of coffee first emerged in Ethiopia, where
the coffea arabica plant produces bundles of
bright red berries in the highlands . By the 16th
century the blackbrewwas thetalkofthe Middle
East, and by 1645 the ﬁrst coffee houses opened
in Europe. By the 1950s, the percolator was a
staple of the modern kitchen. But today there

are other options for energizing that take caf-
feine away from hot and bitter and toward sour
and sweet.

1. Energy Drinks

Starting with Red Bull and followed by every
manner of interpolation, the carbonated, tangy
category ofbeverage known as the energy drink

is the most common variation on coffee’s caffein— .

ated stimulation. ’

“Caffeine itself can move across the mem-
branes of the GI tract pretty easily,” Drill said.
“Once it gets into the intestines, almost all the
caffeine that you take in is absorbed.”

Carbonated energy drinks offer a small ad-
vantage through theirbubbles of carbon dioxide.
Because of increased “gastric motility,” or move-
ment in the stomach, the caffeine gets to the
intestines more rapidly. “It’s not going to make
a big difference,” Drill said. “But it could cause it
to get to the brain faster.”

2. Lemon-Lime Energy-X Lip Balm ($2.99 on
goenergy—x.com)

Tasting somewhat bitter and absent of its
stated lemon—lime ﬂavor, Energy-X Lip Balm
goes on like a stick of Chapstick with a suppos-
edly more potent edge. At ﬁrst the buzz isn’t very
noticeable + it’s lip balm, for Pete’s sake — but
thenI realized that itwas supposed to be applied
frequently. .

Panthers drop first match of the season to Ohio State

The Pitt wrestling team lost its first match olthc season on Frida_v to Ohio State.

Huailei Wang I Staff’ l’hotograpl1e1'

Mike Furlong
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt wrestling team suffered its first loss of
the season on Friday, falling at home to Ohio
State 22-9.

The matchup between the No. 9 Panthers ,
and the N o. 6 Buckeyes marked the third time
that Pitt wrestled a top-10 team in its non—con—
ference schedule.

“I think we can beat that team,” assistant
coachjason Peters said. “They got their hand
raised more times than we did tonight, but if we
come out and win the tough matches  I think
we come out on top. We’ve done thatinthe past,
tonight we didn’t.” ’

The duals started at 165 pounds rather than
the usual 125 pounds because of a random draw
requested by the Ohio State coaching staff. The
decision proved useful for the Buckeyes as they
went on to win the ﬁrst three bouts of the night,
setting out to a 10-0 lead.

“You know, they were just better than us
tonight.” Peters said. “They like to draw, they
drew last year. We won last year at their place,
and they got us this year at ours. I don’t think
the draw has anything to do with it, we just need
to come out and do a better job.”

At 165 pounds, redshirt freshman Tyler Wilps

fell to Derek Garcia 7-5 in sudden-victory. Wilps
had to battle back early in the bout due to several
points scored by Garcia on diving low-single leg
takedowns. Wilps tied the boutwith atakedown
in the third period to force overtime.

At 184pounds, sophomore Max Thomusseit
lost by major decision to No. 13 CJ. Magrum
by a score of 13-5. For Thomusseit, the battle
back from an early—season injury has proven
difficult -— he has compiled a 2-3 record since
returning.

“You know he’s still coming back from‘
injury,” older brother and heavyweight Zac
Thomusseit said. “Mentally he needs to get his
conﬁdence back up because he’sjustbeen out of
it for a while. He needs to get some wins under
his belt. He’s wrestlingwell and his conditioning
is good, he just needs that conﬁdence.”

The Panthers picked three straight wins to
bring the match to an even 9-9 score beginning
with a decision victory by redshirt junior Matt
Wilps. Wilps, ranked No. 5 in the nation, won
his bout over Andrew Carnpolattano with a 4-2
decision. With the bout tied at 2-2 entering the
third period, Wilps decided to keep the bout on
the ground and wrestled on top of Campolat—
tano. He took the lead on a stalling call against
Campolattano followed by a point awarded for
riding time ‘at the end of the bout. '

state government’s budget cuts to higher educa— ,

tion. She traveled to the state capital with other

students for Pitt Day  Harrisburg and lobbied

on the issue.

“We had the largest Pitt.Day we’ve ever had,”
Stieber said. “I think it’s a_ testament to my lead-
ership.” ‘ d

But even after Pitt Day in Harrisburg, Pitt still
received a 22 percent cut in state funding, which
resulted inthe University raising in—state tuition by

8.5 percent and out-of—state tuition by 4 percent. '

Another one of her initiatives was to ensure
that students wouldn’t feel the effects of the Port
Authority service cuts. j = A '

.“I did whatI could to meetwith whoever pos-
sible to keep students informed,” Stieber said.
She met with students and an administrator for
the Port Authority, butthe initiative “kind of died
down.” i ’ up . - »
The PortAuthority implemented a 15 percent
reduction in March, cutting29 routes and reducing
weekday service on an additional 37 routes.

Stieber also worked on the Student Advisory

CommitteeforTheBookCenterto increasestudent '

compensationfortextbooks s_oldbac,kto,The Book
Center, but the initiatives progress was limited;

H “I don’t know if we’ve seen any results yet, but
the discussions aretakingplace,”Stieber said. “I’m
gladto get it started so thatNatalie [Rothenberger,
incomingBoard mernberand Sﬁeber’s internwho
worked with The Book Center] can continue.”

RyanGayman ,

Board member Ryan Gayman hoped to "in-
crease communication in three different areas:
among organizations sharing similar interests,
between Greek Life and non—Greek organizations
and between Pitt and nonproﬁt organizations
within the Pittsburgh area. There is no tangible
evidence of his efforts to create a system to bring

_ the groups together.

Gayman did not respond to six phone calls or
fourvoicemails over the span of aweek. He set up
two interviews to speakwithareporter, but did not
respond to or returnthe phone calls. -

Gaymanwill remain involvedwith SGB in2o12
through the Allocations Committee.

John Hasley '

John. Hasley, Board member and unsuc-
cessful presidential candidate for the 2012 SGB
presidency, ran on the initiatives _of publishing
professors’ surveys "on a departmental website,
creatingaBlackboard app and formingan online
petitioning system.

The Blackboard app was created, but profes-
sors’ surveys arenotposted online. Hasleywas not
available to clarify any details or speciﬁcs aboutthe
status of the petitioning system. ,

Hasley did not respondto sevenphone calls, six
voicemails and one email over a six—day period. _

Laurenjentleson - 1 —

Board member Laurenjentleson ran on the
initiatives of improving the use of a bike share,
adding new shuttle routes and implementing a
shuttle GPS system. ‘ _

Jentleson had envisionedaconvenient location

Jentlesonwas unsuccessfulinaddingnewUni-

_ “I hope that next year’s Board will continue to
build on the projects that-the 2011 Board has set
into motion,” Jentleson said. “I have fullfaith in

the Board and president-electjames Landreneau ,

.and expect great things from each andevery one

" ofthem.” -

Emily Hoover ran on the initiatives of creat-
ing an allocations tutorial online, improving Pitt_
traditions and increasingstudent awareness of

environmental issues on campus. ;
~ She createdthe allocations tutorial onlinewitl1

the help of anallocations liaison, butshe said she

was unable to improve Pitfs traditions because she
shifted her focus on combating the state’s budget

cuts to higher education.

Also, Hoover conceptualized an “Eco Reps”
program that would designate students repre-
sentatives in the residence halls. These residents
would undergo a  session oncea month,
host a monthly program related to sustainability

andworkwiththe ResidentAssistantsto promote I

environmental consciousness to students. Butthis
project is still in the discussion stages and has yet
to be implemented.

.“A lot of projects are meant to carry over,”

. "Hoover said. “Ifyou are passionate about your

projects, you have to pass them on [to the incom-
ingBoard]-.” She also said that she has talked with
incoming Board members Gordon Louderback
andjulie Hallinan about continuing the Eco Reps
project. '

James Landreneau

President-electjames Landreneau’s initiatives
included the implementation of aswipe—in system
at the residence halls, student access to towels
at the University gyms and promoting commu-

nication between professors and students via

Blackboard.

I Landreneau could onlycomplete one of these
initiatives -— havingthe swipe-in system added to

Pitt wins flrst    
conference match

Wrestling 4 22

heavyweight Zac Thomusseit won the nextbout
with a 12-6 decision. Thomusseit, ranked No.
17, completely outwrestled the No. 11—ranked
Peter Capone of Ohio State. Thomusseit was
in position to win the bout by major decision,
but a late reversal scored by Capone erased the
opportunity. “I felt a lot more conﬁdent than I
have,” Thomusseit said. “The guy was more of
my size so I could go out and wrestle himwithout
being outweighed by 60 pounds.”

The bout at 125 pounds in which No. .

17—ranked Pitt junior Anthony Zanetta defeat-
ed No. lsjohnni Dijulius was unusual. Zanetta
came out on top with a 4-3 decision in sudden-
victory, but he did not score a singleoffensive
point in the bout. He acquired his points with
an escape and two stalling calls and a penalty
point in overtime called against Dijulius for an
illegal hold.‘ ' f

Dijuliiis was given a stallingwarningfollowed
by two stalling calls in the second period for
hanging onto Zanetta’s ankle and not attempting
to return Zanetta to the mat on escape attempts.
“I knew_how he was going to wrestle,” Zanetta
said. “I knew it was going to be a slower-paced
match. My opponent’s style kind of dictated the
pace of the match. I knew not to force things and
to stay in good position.” .

Following the 125—pound bout, the team.

score was tied at 9-9 due to Ohio State losing a
point after head coach Tom Ryan argued with
the referee over stalling calls.

With the match tied, the Buckeyes went out
and won the next four bouts to secure the 22-9
victory. They added one bonus point on amajor
decision win at 133 pounds by No. 3—ranked

. Logan Stieber.

Ohio State’s Hunter Stieber, ranked No. 6
in the nation at 141 pounds, picked up a 7-5 de-
cision win over Pitt’s Travis Shaffer. The bout
was a rematch between the two after Shaffer

' picked up a 7-2 win over Stieber in high school

at the Dapper Dan Classic at the Fitzgerald Field
House last March.

The loss to Ohio State marks the end of the
Panthers’ early non—conference matchups,
during which Pitt picked up wins over Lehigh,
Drexel, and Michigan. The matchups included

three ranked opponents.

“With a schedule like we’ve had, it shows that
we’re a program on the rise,” Zac Thomusseit
said. “For all of those teams to wantto schedule
against us means that they know we’re able to
compete against them.”

Despite aloss by double-digit points at home,
the Panthers said they will not be disheartened
by the match. »

“We really need to stay positive,” Zanetta
said. “I know it’s cliche to say keep working hard
and keep doing the same things. But it’s not a

, secret to success, you know, it’s hard work and

focusing on the things you need to do.”
The V Panthers began Eastern Wrestling

League action on Sunday with a win away at ,

Cleveland State. The Panthers saw the matchup
as a way-to bounce back from the tough loss to
the Buckeyes. “You know our ﬁrst EWL match
is against Cleveland State, maybe not the best
of the league,” Zanetta said.

“We _can’t put teams like that behind us. We
still need to get excited and pumped up for it.
It’s just another opportunity to put this match
behind us and start another winning streak.”

The 39-3 win marked Pitt’s 13th straight

victory over an Eastern Wrestling League op- _ A

ponent. The Panthers picked up avictory in nine
of the 10 matches and recorded bonus points in
eight matches. ,

Redshirt seniors Tyler Nauman and Ethan
Headlee picked up second—period pins in their
matches, while seven Panthers ﬁnished with
major decisions. At 165 pounds, Tyler Wilps
almost added to the list of major decisions, pick-
ing up a 12-5 victory. Zanetta and Tyler Wilps are
both undefeated.

Chris Weber picked up the only win for
Cleveland State at 285 pounds. He defeated
Joel Yalmer 3-1. _

' The ﬁrst conference win marks the begin-
ning of the Panthers’ attempt to earn their third
consecutive EWL team title. “We always want to
keep that goingto winthe conference champion-
ship,” Peters said. “That’s always the goal.” 2

What is Alternative Break?

Pitt's Alternative Break ‘program is much more than a volunteer experience over spring break.
The program offers community based projects that include engagement with members of the
community and exposure to the problems, customs and culture of the region. Our teams are

trained by the community partner to understand the speciﬁc content of their service work and '

are prepared to carry out their tasks. Alternative Break creates an experience that influences
participants to reflect on the impact and meaning of their service, to transfer what they have
learned to their own communities and to start them on a course of lifelong active citizenship. .

gwhat we do on Alternative Break?

During the week of Alternative Break, a team of Pitt students participate in a daily volunteering
service project with a local nonprofit organization or community partnuer. Students travel by
chartered bus, train or van to the service site. The sponsoring agency gives an orientation that
outlines the social issues and local impact in the community. ‘Students participate in 30 hours
of service over 4 days with community participants. The lastday is set aside for sightseeing
and exploring the area. The team leader ends each day with group and individuai reflection.
Alternative Break is drug and alcohol-free. / - ‘ - -

Alternative Break....it’s the break that will last a lifetime!

3. Spot On Energy Patches ($13.84 forapack
of 24 on Amazon.com) '
Reminiscent of the classic smoking-cessa—.
tion aid, these energy patches sell themselves

_ on being long—lastingwithout a crash and easy

on the stomach. They also contain a number
of non-caffeine ingredients such as B vitamins,
which might alter the exact effect of the 37 mil-
ligrams bf caffeine contained in each paired
patch. '

Whatever their active ingredient(s), the
patches providedasmooth ﬂow of energywhile

, keeping me free_ of the distracted‘ attitude to

which over—consumption of caffeine can lead.
Despite their value as a new way to get caffeine,
the sticky residue of glue remains where the
patches once rested. I '
“Patches, only work for a molecule that’s
small and can get through fat,” Drill said. Spot
On works when natural bodyheat melts the

adhesive, releasing the components contained j
‘ therein through your skin and into the blood-
stream. A ' V '

I’m not sure if it was caffeineor B12, but
something in those patches might have made
studyingfun again. " .

5. Aeroshot Caffeine Inhaler ($2.99 from

\
av

.Aeroshot.com) I

Breathable Foods is introducing a “caffein
inhaler” that claims to deliver 100 mg of the
substance inaseries of shortpuffs. It sounds like

‘a deviant medical device, but it actually shoots

"a ﬁne powder into the mouth and relies on ac-
tion from there. The appeal of inhaled caffeine
comes with the effectiveness that method has

in getting things to the brain. Unfortunately, I '

wasn’t able to test it.
“There’s just a couple of membranes in the

_ lungs,” Drill said. “It just needs to pass the mem-

brane of alveoli and it’s in the bloodstream.”
Despite the increasingly caffeine-crazy

culture that birthed these energy—induci_ng '

products, the substance itselfisn’t particularly"

dangerouscompared to its peers.

“Caffeine is a less—dangerous than a lot of
other stimulants,” Drill said. “There can be seri-
ous side effects, but it generally requires high

’ . doses. The statistic that’s cited is that you’d have

to drink 50 to 100 cups of coffee to overdose
on caffeine.”  I
