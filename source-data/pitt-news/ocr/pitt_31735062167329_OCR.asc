Faculty Suggests
Broad Changes

At the May 7»faculty meeting
of the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs (GSPIA)
suggestions were made for broad
changes and general evaluations
of urban affairs courses. Chief
among the proposals was the de-
signing of an introductory course.
which would be a core course
called 210. as a first term full-
term course. From here. students
could branch out into their stimu-
lated interests.

The next proposal suggested
elaluations by students of all
urban affairs courses taught in
the 1967-1968 Fall and Winter
terms. The proposed evaluation
forms would rate both course con-
tent and presentation. The eval-
uation is divided into parts. with
each part having a separate grade.
An overall grade for the course
would be determined by adding
the partial grades. As usual. the
evaluations would remain anony-

CHANCELLOR POSVAR WAS instrumental in the functional policy

   

concept which will change the outlook of the University in the field
of Urban Affairs. The recent proposals of the Faculty Senate in the
academic areas have been approved.

A final major proposal was for
the organization of a student
group. whose purpose would be to
articulate the students’ point of
view about the school. act as a

 

forum for discussing urban affairs
and the relationship of the school
to the field. and to encourage com-
munication between professors
and students concerned with con-
temporary urban affairs.

Tsang Discusses Revolution,

  Signifies Importance of Play

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

..“It all started with a play,”. ex-
plained Dr. Chiu-Sam Tsang. for-
mer dean of Faculty of Arts at
Chung Chi College in Hong Kong
and professor of history at the
University. Tsang was referring
to the “Great Proletarian Cultur-
al Revolution" in Communist
China which has thrown the coun-
try into a turmoil.

“The cultural revolution started
as a campaign against the old type
of ‘ideology in literature and art.
especially in the theatrical arts."
The play Tsang singled out was
Hai~Jui Dismissed from Office.
written by the Vice-Mayor of Pe-
king Wu Han in late 1960. The
theme was a sympathetic portrait
of Hai Jui (1514-1587). a Ming
Dynasty official who’ Was dis-
missed from office. His outspoken
appeals on behalf of the suffer-
ings of the people prompted his
dismissal.

Production of the play followed
Peng Te-Huai’s dismissal in 1959.
Te-Huai was an outspoken critic
of Maoist policy. Consequently.
Wu Han’s play was charged with
symbolically criticizing the firing
of Te-Huai from his position as
Defense Minister. This. ironically

led to Wu Han‘s own dismissal.

The revolution took on a poli-
tical character when several of
Mao Tse-Tung’s political com-
petitors supported it. Most pro-
minent among them was Liu Shao
Chi, chairman of Peoples’ Central
Government. Mao’s faction, claim-
ing adherence to the true Marx-
ist-Leninist ideology, labeled
Liu’s faction “revisionist.”

The current trouble in Com-
munist China has undermined her
internal stability and cost the Pe-
king government a loss in favor-
able world opinion. "The struggle
should give America some more

 

breathing space because the Chi-
nese Communists are too busy
with their own affairs to think
about the US.” said Tsang.

Tsang commented that. if suc-
cessful, “the cultural revolution"
would have noticeable effects on
Sino-American relations. “If the
revisionists triumph over Mac. it
looks that Communist China will
follow the Soviet line of diplo-
macy. that is. with the goal of
peaceful coexistence. There would
be less danger of war. However.
“T s a n g continued." with the

USSR and China united. there is
greater danger for the U.S. posi-
tion on the international scene.
Indubitable. the U.S. is in a bet-

ter bargaining position when the"

USSR and China are in dishar-
mony. Tsang lived in Commun-
ist China from 1949 to 1954. His
book Society, Schools and Prog-
ress in China. discussed in detail
the Chinese development since
the Communist takeover. It will
be published this summer by the
Pergamon Press.

Senators Propose Bill
To Lower Voting Age

A bill supporting a constitu-
tional amendment to lower the
voting age to 18‘ has been intro-
duced in the United States Senate.
The bill is sponsored by 44 sena-
tors. including leaders of both
parties. and seems likely to pass
the Senate. Twelve million per-
sons. 47 percent of whom are col-
lege students. would be affected
by passage of thisamendment.

Supporters of the bill have no-
ted that 18 year olds have many
adult responsibilities‘ including
their draft eligibility. They argue
that if these people are being
asked to die for American foreign
policy objectives. they ought to
have a role in shaping those objec-
tives.

Opponents of the ‘bill argue

that 18 year—olds lack responsibi-

lity. Senators Holland of Florida
and Miller of Iowa have cited the
recent colldge riots. and have said
that “the demonstrations show a
lack of maturity on the part of
many 18. 19. and 20 year olds.
who are prone to take an extreme
point of view and push their. ideas
to the exclusion of all others."

     

Senator Javits of New York dis-
agrees with this position. He ar-
gues that demonstrations are a
good reason for lowering the vo-
ting age. He is convinced that
“self-styled student leaders who
urge acts of civil disobedience
would find themselves with no
support if students were given a
more meaningful role in the elec-
toral process."

Ed Schwartz. president of the
National Student Association. told
a Senate subcommittee investiga-
ting the voting bill that an 18-
year old voting bill “will open .,
new avenues for student pressure
and student power.“ He challeng-
ed the Senate to legislate construc-

tive legislation by the House
which denys scholarships to
demonstrators.

Thus far. state legislatures have
been reluctant to lower the voting
age below 21. Georgia and Ken-
tucky have voting ages of 18. Al-
aska has an age of 19. and Hawaii
20. Later this year. Nebraska and
South kota will vote on lower-
ing thelzg. -

Faculty ‘Shows Concern For Urban Affairs
Senate Initiates Several
Programs For Blacks

At the special meeting of the
Senate on May 17. the Chancel-
lor and several administrative of-
ficers of the University reported
on a number of programs on
which it is working with the black
community. These programs
either are underway or in the ad-
vanced planning state. They will
be implemented with the coopera-
tion and involvement of the com-
munity as financial resources be-
come available.

In the academic areas of the
University, these include:

An office for University-Com-
munity Educational Programs un-
der the provost which will coor-
dinate the planning. financing
and operation of all academic
programs;

Special college preparatory,
admissions and financial-aca-
demic support programs for dis-
advantaged undergraduates, which
will get underway this summer;

Academic courses designed to
impress upon students the history
and role of the Negro race _in so-
ciety.

Financial support programs for
graduate students in the Arts and
Sciences as well as in profession-
al schools. such as Social Work
and Public and International Af-

After 12 to 15 years of school a boy becomes out into the
world and is drafted. For the first 15 years of life a man goes _
through two compulsory systems of society that Nat Hentoff
feels deny the basic privileges granted us in the Bill of Rights.
Hentoff, ,a reporter for The New York Times, criticized this

country’s system of education.

When asked what can be done
a bout our system of education,
Hentoff pointed out the distur-
bances at Columbia as evidence
of what can be done on the cam-
pus level. Hentoff said that for
the past ten years Columbia-Uni-
versity has been destroying the
Harlem community. The students
have had absolutely no say in Uni-
versity affairs. Now. there will
finally be some internal. demo-
cracy on the Columbia campus.
and different relationship with
the surrounding community. The
people of Harlem. and the thou-
sand students who did not parti-
cipate in the riots are indebted
to the demonstrators for their ef-
forts in obtaining rights which

_ should have been theirs from the

beginning.

Hentoff also spoke of the Stu-
dents for Democratic Society
CSDS. and several of their efforts
in the New York area. He cited
an instance when Dow Chemical
was scheduled to recruit on a New
York campus and SDS wanted to
protest Mr. Hentoff told how the
SDS didn’t want to simply picket
because this form of demonstra-
tion has been so over-used. In-
stead they thought that they would
napalm a dog to show the effects
of the chemical. There was. of
course much objection to this use
of nepalm on an innocent puppy
dog. and in the end Dow cancel-
led its visit. Hentoff noted that it

 
   
  
  
  
  
   
   
  
   
  
   
  
 
   
   
   
 
    
  
    
  
    
     
  
   
 
 

fairs; and,

Cooperative ventures between
the University and city schools; pg
as well as training programs for 7
elementary and secondary school
specialists, aimed at usihg the
University’s expertise to a greater
degree in order to attack the prob-
lem of disadvantaged youth at the
pre-university level of education.

In the public service areas of
the University, among the efforts
presently being undertaken are:

The availability of University
facilities. particularly in the ath-
letic area, for use by community-
groups;

Use of the University’s exper- W.
tise in the various health fields
in order to attack the problem of
providing new kinds of health ser- 2
vices in the community and the
ghetto; .

Publication by the University
Press of works dealing with Ne-
gro culture, history and art ;. and.

A continuing assessment of the
University’s own hiring practices
in order to make the maximum
contribution to solving the prob-‘
lem of hard-core unemployment
and to assure a proper representa- s
tion of the races among the Uni-
versity’s own personnel.

country say nothing of using the

Hentoff related how Tom Hay-

by MARC SIMON

Last week I was assigned to

cover the first meeting of a new

political group on campus. the
Students to Update Present Idio-
tic Doctrines. or as they call them-
selves. STUPID. I arrived at the
partially filled YMCA locker room
where the meeting was being
held. and I noticed that the audi-
ence was comprised of six long-
haired men and/or women. two
balding. older men (perhaps pro-
fessors). two kids playing with a
frisbee. a small cat. and the jani-
tor. who told me he was there to

~ “keep dese guys from startin‘ a

ruckus." I took my seat next to
locker number 148 and quietly

I ‘waited for the meeting to begin.

After a few minutes. the presi-
dent of STUPID ascended to the
rostrum (which looked like the top
of a water cooler to me l. Then he
began to present the platform on
which STUPID was based.

“First of all." he declared.’

While combing his beard. “all for-
mal classes should be abolished.
and professors should be required
to attend bull sessions. Second.
bull sessions should be made a
major field of study. Third. stu-
dents should be required to stop
wasting their time going to crum-
my bull sessions. All of us should
remember that we are here at
school for a purpose."

A tremendous ovation, consist-
ing of three claps and a stifled
purr from the cat, followed this
proud declaration. After the deaf-
ening tumult died down. I asked
the speaker just what he felt was

I the purpose of the student at the
/university today. He sneered at me

and said,’ “What are you. some
kind of right-wing‘ fascist? How
can you ask such a ridiculous, un-
important question?”

Just then the frisbee with which
the two kids had been playing
sailed up and hit the speaker in
the mouth. He cried. "Why. this
is an obvious attempt to curtail
my freedom of speech." He point-
ed an accusing finger at me and
screamed. “I knew you and your
type of crazy communistic an-
archy would try and disrupt this

. meeting."

At this point I felt I had better

leave while I still could but on

y way out I stepped on the cat‘s
ti ' <1 ee

The speaker shouted. “Raid. raid!
I hear the sirens! Everybody

.out!!"

Immediately the crowd went
berserk and rushed for the exit.
but the janitor had it blocked.
“Lousy hippies." he shouted as
the crowd pushed by him and
beat a hasty path for the nearest
bar. They remained there for over
four hours. At this point I real-
ized that STUPID really wasn't
such a bad group after all.

Survey Reveals New Categories

by PEGGY ALLEN

Where have all the McCarthy-
ites gone? Until about a month
ago. there were over 400 students
working for Senator McCarthy.
But. since Bobby Kennedy felt
safe to enter the race. Johnson
traded places with Humphrey.
and Rockefeller changed his mind
about running (again). many stu-
dents have switched their support.
A survey taken among those for-
mer McCarthy workers still on
campus revealed that the major-
ity now fall into three categories:
those who still support McCar-
thy. those who support Kennedy.
and those who support Rockefel-
ler.

Many students supported Mc-
Carthy only because Kennedy.
their real choice. wasn't running.
“I didn‘t support Kennedy then
for the same reasion I‘m not sup-
porting Howard Hughes now." said
senior Ricky Vatz. “He isn't run-
ning.” Joanne Telerico. WPGH
Dee Jay. says she prefers Kenne-
dy because “he has the power."
but added that she favors McCar-
thy over Humphrey and “would
not be disappointed if McCarthy
got the nomination." Sophomore
Frank Fasciano favors Kennedy
becarse he “provides a similar al-
ternative (as McCarth_vi. but has
a better chance of winning. "

‘CUSTOM FRAMING

Hobart Harris. who still sup-
ports McCarthy. said he "knows
that McCarthy won‘t win.“ John
Selisky. another McCarthy sup-
porter feels "McCarthy has the
qualifications. but not the power
to win” because “Kennedy has
the money."

A few students have turned to
Rockefeller. One New York senior
said she “felt that Rocky would
be a good President because of
all he has done for New York.”

Several students felt Kennedy
should drop out of the race. Scott
Baum. former committee leader
in Students for McCarthy. said
he “hoped to see McCarthy make
his candidacy a matter of prin-
ciple only” and that he should get
out now. Fasiano believes McCar-
thy should quit before the Calif-
_fornia Primary because “the only

  Proposals

The university has initiated and planned a number of
programs that will, hopefully, cause this institution to be-
come an integral part of the overall planning of the Pitts-
burgh community. Most of these programs are being planned
under the mutual guidance of the University and the black
community. The programs include:

— An office for University-Community Educational Pro-
grams under the Provost which will coordinate the planning.
financing, and operation of all academic programs.

. —‘ Special college preparatory, admissions and financial
support programs for disadvantaged undergraduates, which
will get under way this summer.

— Academic courses designed to impress upon students

' the history and role of the Black race in society.

— Cooperative ventures between the University and city
schools, as well as training programs for elementary and
secondary school specialists aimed at using the University’s
expertise to a greater degree in order to attack the prob-
lem of disadvantaged youth at the pre-university level of
education.

— The availability of University facilities, particularly
in the athletic area, for use by community groups.

— Use of the University’s expertise in the various health
fields in order to attack the problem of providing new kinds
of health services in the community and the ghetto.

-— A continuing assessment of the University’s own hiring
practices in order to make the maximum contribution to
solving the problem of hard-core unemployment and to as-
sure a proper representation of the races among the Uni-
versity’s personnel. ~» -g . ,_ . _. _ . .,

These are -fine programs. Unfortunately. the mere=plan-

’ ning and initiation of community and academic programs

does not assure their implementation. The University state-

ment said: ‘They (the programs) will be implemented with

the cooperation and involvment of the community as finan-
cial resources become available. ”

Under these uncertain circumstances, we fear that
many of these programs will either die an early death or
never become realities.

We would expect wide community acceptance of the
University’s planned programs for they are not only timely
but essential to the dynamics of this urban center. The prob-
lem, however, concerns the element of financial assistance.

The Pitt News believes that these programs are very
basic to the purpose of the University and we therefore
urge businessmen specifically in the Pittsburgh area to give
the University the financial assistance it needs to imple-
ment these essential community and academic programs.

‘Num—m-mber please." said the

Opinion

 

The Land Of The

by DAVE TIERNAN

..According to a recent press re-
lease from Washington. a consti-
tutional ammendment has been
introduced in Congress to lower
the voting age to 18. The release
went on to say that nearly one
half of the 12 million persons in
the 18-21 year age bracket are
college students. In lieu of the
debate over the ammendment in
Congress. the question of whether
or not eighteen—year-olds are ma-
ture anough to vote is pertinent.

Those Senators that support the
ammendment feel that if 18-year-
olds are old enough to defend the
country‘s foreign policy. they are
old enough to vote on what that
policy should be. The senators
that oppose the ammendment
argue that recent demonstrations
on college campuses indicate a
lack of maturity in students of
the 18 thru 21 year age.

Well. what the hell to they
expect students to do‘? As the sen-
ators who support the ammend-
ment say. the students can die
but they can’t vote! The demon-
strations may not show a mature
way of handling the situation.
but the demonstrations do indi-
cate an interest in foreign policy

    

tions. Then my vote will be at
the mercy of the political party
pushersf‘

_.“After the Democrats and the
Republicans pick their candidates.
I'll have only two choices. Unless
one consideres that fellow from
Alabama. Or. unless McCarthy
decides to pull awa_y from the
Democratic party and go it alone.
Of course. hes dedicated to the
party. Not as much as Humphrey.
But dedicated.

“Have you taken a good long
look at each candidate lately‘?“
continued Pinky.

“Well, What this country needs.
Right now. More than anything.
Is. A rabble rouser. Someone who
will stir the people into one. Some-
one who as president will tell the
people that if they want the gov-
ernment to do something and pass
a law to help the cities and the
poor and the races then they have
to tell their man in congress. That
president will tell the senators and
the congressmen to get off their
hunches stop playing politics with
everything and the lobbies and
get something done so this whole
country doesn’t look like an obi-
tuary in the morning newspaper.

that has evidently been lacking lll
past years.

Students at the University have
shown an acute awareness in cur-
rent national politics. foreign po-
licy and the upcoming election.
Heated arguments and casual dis-
cussions are much more frequent
in the cafeteria. classrooms. and
student bars than the usual col-
lege chit-chat about the week-
end's events. etc. Although the
majority of University students
can't vote in November. twice as
many voted in Time Magazines
Choice ‘68 than voted in the Stu-
dent Government election.

As students. we are aware of
the events that happen around us——
civil rights. the Viet Nam War.
the travel ban all affect students
as taxes affect voting adults. But
what have the voters done to im-
prove Government control via
taxes? If the present trend of
government control continues in
the future. the democracy that we
once had in this country will be
nothing more than a socialist state.
Students are voicing their demo-
cratic rights as citizens.

The demonstrations are merely
the expression of student discon-
tent with current policies. While

“If an_yone could be like this
it would be Kennedy. I'm not
counting out Humphrey altogether
either. I don‘t count Nixon and
Rockefeller though. If Kennedy
is the Dmocratic choice then he
should be president.

"But the way things are going.
It looks like Humphrey versus
Nixon. That would be the voters"
choice. Nixon sticks by his guns.
The Democrats know that if he
gets into office he probably would
be around for eight years. He can
organize and that‘s where hes
tough to beat. As for the Vice-
President. Theres no finer man
or patriot. Hes loyal. The Amer-
ican way would rest on his con-
science. He'd be a good president
to lead these troubled people.

“But anyway. How’s everything
with you. Working hard‘? Getting
enough sleep?”

“Say you know. Buddy What
is in town. and he‘ll be around
for awhile. Why don‘t you give
him a call. My opinion isn't the
only one. You know. I'll see ya.
,.Goodbye."

.???—Free?

there may be a better way for
students to voice their opinion.
demonstrations can‘t be regarded
asa sign of immaturity. Students
here and across the country are
interested in political policies.
and since the majority of them
can't vote. the demonstrations are
merely an expression of their in-
terest. Rather than looking to the
demonstrations as a sign of irres-
P0nSlbim.V- the fact that voting
would give the students a voice
in the country through established

channels should be considered.

Possibly the voting adults are

not aware of the fact that the 18-
year-olds of today have more edu-
cation. more awareness. and as
has been shownlately. more con-
cern with political policies than
those in years gone by. It is much
easier for adults to condemn stu-
dents for the recent demonstra-
tions than to realize the concern
students are showing in their fu-
ture. Adults show the same con-
demnation for six million stu-
dents as a result of the actions of
a few radical demonstrators as
they do for minority groups as a
result of the actions of a few in-
dividuals in that group. But that
is another story.

During an interview. the direc-
tor of men's housing casually re-
marked that visiting students
might mark up the blank. white
wall on the Forbes St. entrance
to the new dormitories but not

“the mature students of Pitt.

It’s not that University students
are more mature; it’s just that no
one on this campus has ever done
such a thing and probably would-
n’t know how to go about marking
up a wall in the accepted collegi-
ate fashion even if he wanted to.

However. Vhaturity has abso-
lutely nothing to do with it. The
truth is that Pitt students just

don’t give a good hot—damn about
anything — much less spattering
paint on a dormitory wall.

Of course. things usually pick
up in September when the rabble
rousers return for another year of
u s e l e s s demonstrating against
Convocation speakers. but what
are we poor summer students to
do until then?

NEW YORK — The ideology of
the SDS—led rebellion at Colum-
bia has been relatively overlook-
ed in three weeks of conservative
backlashing. The establishment
news media have made the pub-
lic all too familiar with the tac-
tics of the demonstrators. while
leaving the less sensational causes
of the rebellion in the background.

During a week’s stay at Colum-
bia at the time of the demonstra-
tions. I had ample opportunity to
acquaint myself with both sides
of the issue. It is my intention to
present one of these points of
view. that of the SDS.

Porbably the most organized
and best functioning arm of the
Columbia SDS is its. propoganda
mill. Almost hourly during points
of the demonstrations. such as the
liberating of Hamilton and Low.

. or the visits of Mssr. Stokely Car-

michael. H. Rap Brown and
Charles 37X Kenyatta. SDS run-
ners could be seen scurrying about
the campus delivering bundles of
mimeoed and xeroxed bulldtins.
Wherever people congregated on
campus. SDS had someone hand-
ing out leaflets.

The bulletins themselves were
generally well-written, succinct,
and honest. Through them , SDS
sought to communicate its ideo-
logy to the general student body
in the hope of attracting more
support. One of the earliest SDS
bulletins was an open letter to the
faculty, giving explanation to the
iaéiié at .Ii61?Ii‘ﬁ’g ‘Acting ‘Dean
Henry Coleman hostage for 26
hours, and offering evidence of
the long fuse leading to the explo-
sive take-over of Columbia.

SDS wrote: “The sit-ins now
taking place inside Hamilton Hall
and Low Library are the culmina-
tion of a whole year in which the
University Administration has
consistently failed to give a sin-
gle inch on the political issues
around which campus protest has
developed. In fact, it has been a
year in which the Administration
has actually diminished existing
student rights.

“At the beginning of the year.
President Kirk issued a ban on
demonstrations in U n i v e r s i t y
buildings. Several times during
the Fall and early Spring semes-
ters. SDS held indoor demonstra-
tions_and) each time the Admin-
istration invented absurd seman-
tic distinctions concerning the
word ‘demonstration’ to avoid en-
forcing their rule. On March 27.
150 people demonstrated inside
Low Library against the Institute

. for Defense Analysis (IDA). They

presented a petition with over 1.-
500 signatures calling for Colum-
bia to sever all ties with the IDA.

“Reacting to the anti-IDA sen-I
timent expressed in the petition,
the Trustees passed an April 1 res-
olution (affectionately known on
campus as the April Fools’ Reso-
lution) ‘formally’ disassociating

Columbia from the IDA—but Pres-
ident Kirk and trustee Burden con-
tinue to sit on the IDA executive
committee, counterinsurgency re-
search continues to get done at
Columbia, and nothing has
changed . . .”

A major issue behind the dem-
onstrations was the inconsistency
of the Administration regarding
its stated policy toward disciplin-
ary procedure and the de facto
lack of due process at Columbia.
The Columbia College Handbook
(p. 78) maintains " . . the Dean
and his staff endeavor to follow
the constitutional traditions of due
process. A student has the right
to hear the full charges against
him and to present and interro-
gate witnesses. . . . The student is
also advised that he may. if he
wishes. request a more formal
hearing before the Dean . .  The
fa ct that s e V e n demonstrators
were being denied those very
rights added much fuel to the fire
of protest on campus.

As the SDS bulletin of Tues-
day. April 23. stated: “Six stu-
dents who participated in the
March 27 IDA demonstration -
who walked inside a -buildihg to
present a petition — have been
placed under disciplinary proba-
tion. The administration has re-
fused to grant these six and open
hearing on their case . . 

Much scandal has been made
of the students “storm trooper”
tactics in taking over the build-
ings. As the SDS bulletin explain-
ed: “Because use of ‘normal chan-
nels’ (demonstrations, petitions,
etc.) not only didn’t produce re-
sults on these issues but led to
disciplinary proceedings, we have
been forced to take stronger ac-
tion. The students sitting in at
‘I_I‘amAilto_r_i__§nd _Lo_w have adopted
the following demands:

1. All disciplinary action now
pending and probations already
imposed upon six students be im-
mediately terminated and a gen-
eral amnesty be granted to those
participating in these demonstra-
tions.

2. Construction of then Colum-
bia gym in Morningside Park
should cease at once.

3. The University should use its
good offices to see that charges
against persons arrested at the
gym site be dropped.

4. All relations with IDA be
severed. i n c 1 u d i n g President
Kirk’s and Trustee Burden’s mem-
berships.”

In answer to the popular op-
position their first demand of un-
conditional amnesty before they
would negotiate with the Admin-
istration, SDS stated:

“We will negotiate with any

Administration r e p r e s e n t a t ive

once he has agreed to our first de-
mand of amnesty: negotiations
with a club held over our heads
are a mockery. For that reason we
are forced to hold Dean Coldman
in his office: with the Adminis-
tration possessing the power to
suspend us or to use police at any
time. holding the dean unfortu-
nately becomes a major source
of our bargaining power."

Thd SDS and SAS charges of
"racism" against the Columbia
administration were not spontan-
eously induced by the furor of
building - invasions; t h e y were
long in coming. As SDS wrote on
Wednesday. April 24: "What do
we mean by ‘liberal racism’ and
‘institutional racism‘? How can
Administrators Grayson Kirk and
David Truman. upstanding liber-
als who are against the war. for
civil rights. who woulp go so far
as to hold a memorial service and
even cancel school for a day to
honor Martin Luther King — how
can they be racists? It is actually
very simple. Like all other in-
stitutions in this society. when it
is in the administration’s econom-
ic interest to exploit and oppress
people. they try to pick on down-
trodden people who will have no
support. The need cafeteria (and
other) workers who will take ex-
ecrable working conditions and
salaries like $65 a week — so they
hire black and Spanish-speaking
people. But if these people _had a
union. they would have the
strength to resist Columbia and
wrest improvements from it—the
administration fights unions tooth
and nail (since 1928) through in-
timidation. scabs and firing work-
ers. They want land to put their
buildings on (or to build housing
projects on — contractor at guar-
anteed profit rate Percy Uris.
Trustee. Columbia University).
Where did they get the land‘? By
th r o w i n g black and Spanish-
speaking and poor white working
people out of their homes by force
and violence. (How would you
like the heat turned off on your
family in mid-winter? )”

In another bulletin, issued the
following day, SDS wrote of the
hostage tactic: “So when the ad-
minstration says ‘Let poor Dean
Coleman go; don’t hold him pris-
oner by force,’ we say, ‘Let Fred
Wilson (the arrested demonstra-
tor) go; he’s held prisoner in pris-
on; and don’t hold half the SDS

steering committee hostage with
expulsion, the draft, etc., hang-
ing over their heads.’ And when
Dean Truman says, ‘Stop your ac-
tions, and we’ll talk to you,’ our
logical response is to say, ‘Stop
your actions. Get out of IDA. Stop
building the gym. Remove your
threats of discipline. Then we’ll
talk to you.’ However, we are
moderate: we only say, ‘Stop
threatening us (the demonstrators)
and we’ll talk to you.” That is why
only our first demand is not ne-
gotiable; we will discuss with the
administration the means by
which ‘as a eulogy of Dr. King?)
it will terminate its racist po-
licies.” I
Perhaps t h e m 0 st definitive

statements from within Columbia
eminated from its daily press. The
Spectator. In an editorial publish-
ed on Friday. April 26. The Spec-
tator made the following observa-
tions: “The real thrust behind
what the demonstrators have been
doing is not merely accession to
six demands. but to bring about
fundamental changes so that stu-
dents and faculty have at least
a say and perhaps full control in
the running of the University. We

have in the past fully supported

such change. and it is unfortrnate »

that this has become obscured in
the past few days. . . . It must be
made clear. however. that it is
the failure of the administration
to allow students and faculty their
fundamental rights that has preci-
pitated these student demonstra-
tions and splits with the faculty.
Not until the administration is
prepared to grant these rights can
the future of the University he
made both democratic and se-
cure.” ‘

Such is the present situation at
Columbia. The liberated build-
ings have been re-liberated by the
administration. but classes have
not yet resumed. And mere build-
ings do not constitute the great-
ness that was Columbia Univer-
sity; a greatness that is past, for
Columbia’s administrative under-
wear has been washed before the
public. It may be regained if a
viable coalition emerges from the
current re-structuring of the Uni-
versity. In any event, the redis-
tribution of power at Columbia
will be a slow and painful pro-
cess. at least as painful as the
process that brought it about.

Last Home Game Tomorrow

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The streaking Panther baseballers. who swept a ‘double-

header from Penn State Wednesday 5-3 and 4-0. play host to .
Hiram College at Forbes Field tomorrow afternoon. Game time is

1:30 P.M.

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis is confident that his_team willwin.
despite the fact that he doesn't know anything about this year s Hiram

team.

"We expect to sweep the re-
maining games of the season.”
said Lewis optimistically, ‘-‘We’ve
been playing real good baseball
lately."

In their last two wins against
Penn State, the mitters extended
their winning streak to seven
games. Dave Welty went the dis-
tance in the first game, striking

' out 15 batters, but walking 7.

“Welty‘s pitches were taking
off in every direction possible."
said catcher Sammy Glass. “He

Hopes for .500 Season

Ride On Golfers’ Match  
With N acvy at Annapolis

by ED CONLEY

Before this spring’s golf season began Coach Rex Perry
made note of a disappointment towards the previous season. His
team had hoped for a .500 or better showing and had just missed it.

At that time Peery predicted the .500 record for this year's team.
saying. “I think we can do it this time."

But. thus far. the wins have not come as expected and. if the gol-

fers are to reach their goal. they
will have to beat two of the teams
that Peery originally thought
woulp be the toughest on the
schedule—Navy and Penn State.

The coach has seen these
squads in tournaments this year
and still thinks that they will be
hard to beat. But, he claims, “We
have a good chance.”

“We could win one. or maybe

I both of them." he adds.

The first test will come tomor-
row with Navy the opposition at
Annapolis. Being the visitor‘ could

‘hurt the Panthers. Their road re-

cord this spring shows three wins
against seven losses. They have
yet to lose a match at the Shan-
nopin course.

“We have a chance to beat
them, if we play like we did at
Allegheny,” Peery mentions. The
golfers played their best road
match at Allegheny last week
when they came home with a
solid 12-6 victory.

That win changed Peerys
attitude. He was beginning to
believe that they could not do
anything, right and that the .500

season was about to vanish.

..He said. after Allegheny.
“We've been spotty. We’ve been
up and down. and now were
picking up! "

The win over Allegheny now
has Peery believing that his team
can handle what he calls the
“tough ones.” These teams fin-
ished higher in the tournaments
than his duffers, but the tourneys
were bad days for his squad. Now
he foresees good days. The good
days will come or there’ll be a
long layoff before next spring
wondering what went wrong.

Despite the ups and downs
and the 6-7 record. Peery is not
unhappy with the play of his
golfers.

'“We expected a better record
at this point. but it's been a pretty
good season." he says.

The team has played some
"pretty good" golf this spring.
The only thing that has gone

wrong. with the exception of one
or two, matches. ‘has been the
quality of the opposition. In most
cases it was rougher than expec-
ted. and in some cases it was too
rough.

 

NO BID
The four college baseball teams
competing in the District 11 seg-

‘ment of the NCAA mitt’tourna-

ment were announced Wednes-
day. Pitt was not one of them.

Despite his wildness. the left-
handed pitching ace held Penn
State scoreless after the fourth
inning.

“Welty stayed tough." said
Lewis who was happy to see his
ace hold the lead that the mitters
built in the fifth inning.

The baseball team took the
lead 4-3. in the fifth inning when
with two outs. Bobby Kohl walked.
stole second base. and was
doubled home by shortstop Ken
Cooke.

In the second game. footballer
George Medich pitched his sec-
ond straight five-hit shutout. The
6'5“ right-hander is now 5-1 this
season. and the winningest pit-
cher on the squad. George had to
pitch out of hot water in the first
third. and sixth innings to win.

Winning two games is enough
to make any coach happy. but
beating Penn State added extra-
enjoyment for Lewis.

"Penn State beats Pitt in so
many other sports. and they beat
us in baseball twice last year.“
said Lewis. “It was good to beat
P.S.U.."

“After the first game. Penn
State was really down.” contin-
ued Lewis. “They couldn’t take
losing."

The two wins brought the base-
ball team's record to 16-9 with
only three games left. Tomorrows
game against Hiram will be the
last home game.

“Last year. Hiram won its dis-
trict championship. and the last
time we played them. they beat
us." said Lewis objectively. "So
I don't think they'll be a shoe-in. "

Lewis will start either Dave

Welty or George Medich against 4

Hiram. If the mitters play like
they have been. their winning

. streak should still be alive.

State Handles Netters Easily, 8-1

by MARTHA HARTLE

For the first time in three years. the netters scored a point
against Penn State, but Coach Ben Pope’s boys will be looking

for more than a point when they close out the ’68 season at Hiram Col-

lege tomorrow.

“We should win at Hiram.” predicted the coach, whose team has

BOB STRO.\lP
I-nu \\ I'iIm'r

 

been plagued by rain all week.

The netters were trounced by
arch—rival Penn State Wednes-
day. 8-1. but Bob Salembier and
Tom Stromp teamed up for a
doubles win to spoil a third con-
secutive shut-out for the team
from Mt. Nittany.

Salembier and Stromp, playing
in the number two doubles slot,
defeated Joe'Kaplan and Tom De-
Huff in straight sets 7-5, 6-2.

For Stromp. the doubles vic-
tory had extra significance. Ear-
lier in the afternoon. he had drop-
ped a singles decision to DeHuff
6-4. 6-1. The doubles win evened
the personal score between Stromp
and DeHuff. who have been com-
peting against other since their
days in junior tennis. Both boys
are native Pittsburghers and their
personal rivalry began at age ten. -

Stromp and Salembier recorded
the only point on the scorecard.
but senior Bill Nichols came
through with a personalrvictory
of his own. In the past two years.
Nichols faced State's number one
man Mario Obando. In those two
years. Nichols failed to win one
game against the Penn State star.
Nichols broke that shut-out string

Wednesday. He won two games
from Obando. while dropping the

match 6-1. 6-1.

In other singles matches, the
State netters completely domin-
ated the action, winning all
matches in straight sets.

Salembier lost to Neil Kramer
6-2. 6-0: Chuck Wilson was
crushed by Tom Daley 6-0. 6-1.
and Elliot Sainer fell to Glenn
Rupert 6-1. 6-0. John King was
downed by Kaplan 6-1. 6-3.

The numbers one and three
doubles teams didn‘t fare much
better.

..In the number one match.
Nichols and King lost to Obando
and Kramer 6-1. 6-2. while Sanier
and Wilson dropped the ‘number
three match to Daley and Rupert
6-1. 6-4.. .. -

 

 

Tliinclads Host Ohio U.,
Face Stiff Challenge in
Only Meet At Stadium

In the first and only home meet of the outdoor season tomor-
row. tracksters host Ohio University. Coach Jim Banner believes

this will be his ‘toughest challenge of the season. Scheduled for 1:00
p.m.. the meet Wlll be at Pitt Stadium.

Banner and his young assistant coach. Gary Meckley. rate Ohio as
one of the top teams in the Midwest and the best in the Mid.-\merican

Conference.

"Everyone will have to be out-
standing to defeat Ohio." com-
mented Meckley. He also re-
marked that Ohio has the NCAA
-440 champion. who also runs the

100 in :09.5 and 220 in 21 seconds. i

In addition, Ohio has three ath-
letes who throw the javelin over
210 feet, and a mile relay team

PAUL GREIG

(‘lu.s'¢'.\' l‘I'(l('l\' ('(lI'<’r'r

that competes under the 3: 10 mark.

“Ohio is real well balanced and
have been building their team for
five or six'years.” said Meckley.

According to Meckley. the thin-
clads must overcome a 38 point
difference because of depth prob-
lems. First of all. Meckley pointed
out. “We haven't any pole
vaulters. and Bob Mac Elhennvs
loss will cost us about ten points."
Overall it amounts to a 19 point
loss for the varsity and a 19 point
gain for Ohio.

Despite Ohio‘s great depth. the
track squad is enthusiastic. Meck-
ley said. “Our seniors will be
pointing for the meet. since it
will be their last performance be-
fore the hometown fans. ”

He also remarked that senior
Wayne Bodenheimer -will be go-
ing for the school record in the
javelin. In the other events. Meck-
ley anticipates that senior Roger
Holly will run the half mile and
probably the mile relay. Hap Par-
etti will enter the mile relay.
and Hurdler Chuck Reisen and

Two miler Paul Greg will also_

see action.

Sophomore aces Jerry Richey
and Bryant Salter will compete
in their usual events. Richey will
run in the mile and the two mile.

1..

RECORD HOLDING high jumper Bryant Salter
won three events last week in the Big Four quad-
rangular track meet at Syracuse. The lanky sopho-
more was the first competitor in the history of the
meet to do so. His wins came in the high jump,

while Salter will compete in the
highjump. broadjump. and triple-
jump. He won all three in last
week’s Quadrangular Meet.

..Three comparatively new faces
will enter the competition. Greg
Ellis will contend in the shotput
and possibly the discus. Doug
Poust will throw" the discus. and
the improving Paul Zink will run
in the half mile. Meckley said
all the assignments are only tena-
tively set.

Ohio will send a few of their
members to the All Ohio Invi-
tational Meet. although the great
majority of the squad will travel
to Pittsburgh. “Banner may change
his lineup, depending on who Ohio
sends here Saturday.” remakred
Meckley.

Sophomore QB Dave Havern
'2 Discounts Own Lack of Siz

Dave Havern threaded his
way through Pitt’s football

locker room and its mass of bulk-
ing bodies and stepped onto the
scale for his daily weigh-in. The
needle strained to reach the 155-
pound mark. but he quickly wrote
“168 pounds” on his Weight
chart.

“The coaches take those sort of
things into consideration. and I
need all the help I can get.” said
the little sophomore quarterback
who had been one of the major
surprises of the Panthers’ spring
camp.

Mainly because of his size.
Dave has always had trouble con-
vincing people that he is a good
football player. Even in his pads.
he looks like a kid who mistaking-
ly wandered in from the sandlots.

When he was a senior at Mon-
tour, Dave led the football team
to an undefeated season and won
numerous honors.

“My coach told me that I was
good enough to play college ball.
but he said that they might think
that I was too small. So we put
down 510”. 170 pounds on every-
thing.” The height is another exag-
geration; Dave stands about 5’8".

One of his other tricks was
wearing sweaters under his shirts
when he met coach Hart to make
himself look bigger. ““I don tknow
whether it worked. ’he sighed.
“but I was awfully hot.

With or without the aid of
those sweaters, Dave made It to

broad jump, and triple jump. Salter had his eye on

the Olympic Trials possibly as a high jumper or

triple jumper. During the indoor season, he leaped

6-10, but has yet to better 6-8 this spring. He’ll be
out to improve tomorrow against Ohio U.

Eps Early Softball Leader

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

....Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity jumped into an early first place
lead with a 2-0 mark in the undergraduate summer football

league intramurals. But Zeta Beta Tau, Delta Tau Delta. and Delta
Sigma Phi are close behind with 2-1 records.

The teams with the best two records will reach the play-offs; eight
teams are competing.

Phi Ep beat Delta Tau Delta 14-6. and clobbered the Pitt Band.
11-0. But runners-up ZBT and Delta Sigma Phi have displayed even
more hitting.

ZBT topped Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, 13-2, in their first game,
and were slaughtering the Bayard Street Bombers who were fielding
only seven men 34-2, before Director of Intramurals Leo Bemis stopped
the game in the sixth inning.

“I’d let the game go on if you only had 30 runs.” Bemis jokingly

told a ZBT player. “But it’s gettihg late and another game has to be_

played.”

Delta Sigma Phi fraternity scored 8 runs in the last inning to hand
the Zeebs there only loss. The Delta Sigs also trounced the Mothers.
18-0; but lost to Delta Tau Delta. 6-5.

In other games. despite the heavy hitting of catcher Don Shae-
fitz. Sigma Alpha Mu (0-3) lost to the Delts. 12-5. and the Pitt Band.
7-6. the Bayard Street Bombers (1-1) beat the Mothers. 16-7.

DAVE HAVERN (17) isn't as concerned about his small size as most

people." Standing only 5-8 and weighing around 160, he overcame

many barriers and finished spring football practice as the number one

quarterback. Yet he remains the type of meat defensive lineman look
for.

Pitt, and this spring he battled
veteran Frank Gustine for the
starting quarterback job. He was
the starting quarterback in the
spring game.

“That was really something."
Dave admitted. “I knew I could
do it if I had a chance. They
were still scared because of my
size. but I showed them. I proved
something.”

If Dave doesn’t worry about his
welfare. other people do. On one
play during a scrimmage. sopho-
more tackle Howard Broadhead.
who a 6’5”. 245 pounds could
make two of Havern. smashed into
him after Dave had passed. and
both went down in a heap. Dave
got up. and got up ready to swing.

Some people were amazed that
Dave got up at all. Each time he
goes down in a pile, it looks like
he’ll never get up;;but he always
does.

“I’m really thankful that I’ve
never really been hurt." said
Dave. “Besides. sometimes it's
how bad you want to get up. .A
-lot of guys want to stay down.

But. if I do. I won’t get another
chancef’

Actually. Dave has been injur-
ed once - playing" defense as a
freshman. He was playing de-
fense because the freshman
coaches didn't think he was big
enough to pla_v quarterback. But
injuries to the other frosh quarter-
backs forced him into a starting
job against Notre Dame. In that
game. he engineered three touch-
down drives.

This spring Dave worked hard
to become one thing that all quar-
terbacks must be - a team leader.
He remarked that “it’s hard for a
sophomore quarterback to gain
the guys’ respect.

“I think that I did so well this

spring because I don't like to
lose. I’ve never played on a foot-
ball team that I didn't start on.
I really know I can do the
job.” .
In the past a lot of people have
doubted whether little Dave Ha-
vern could do the job. He showed
them then. and he expects to show
quite a few more in the future.

people are so certain in their be-
liefs. that they do the rest of the
people a favor by telling them
what to do and in some cases forc-
ing them to conform to these
ideas. These people are more
commonly known as the status
quo. “they." or the great “every-
one" that everyone talks about.

“Everyone" spends a great deal
of their time trying to force the
non — conformists to conform.
“They" do this in the name of
everything that is right. The non-
conformist knows that "they" only
do this to help him to become a
better person and to lead a more
fulfilling life. I

“They” have their ways of pres-
suring the non-conformist. “They”
will call him names. People with
new political ideas are called
Communists, anarchists, or just
plain radicals. People with dif-
ferent hairstyles or wearing ap-
parel are labeled hippies or
queers. If it’s one thing one can’t
be in this country, it’s radical, a
hippie, or a homosexual.

If this name —calling doesn‘t
work. more disastrous measures
are taken. “Everyone" stops talk-
ing to the non-conformist. “They”
avoid him in droves. If this does-
n‘t change him. he may lose his
job or be held back from getting

one.

“Hey Faggot." Actually. they are
saying “How dare you be differ-
ent from me. You can‘t possibly
be happy doing what you're do-
ing and I won't even let you try."
Whatever the status quo does is
right.

What makes one style of dress

makes it feminine or masculine‘?
Or in a skirt for that mattter?
(The Romans wore them long be-
fore there was a United States.)
Or high heels? (Ben Franklin had

see a picture of George Washing-

pie?) What makes one style of
dress masculine or feminine. cor-
rect or incorrect? We were all
born naked.

God forbid, I should attend a

Nobody hires subversives.

The best way to avoid any un-

and to do whatever “everyone" is
