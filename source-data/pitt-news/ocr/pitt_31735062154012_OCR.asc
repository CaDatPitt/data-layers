ALL’-AM.ERICAN MATERIAL

. Cap~tain,Wagner’s work ‘~ has been
cited as- being of the "All-American
class.” Pitt students have known
this for a long time, but it proves our
contention when one of the large
western ;dai1i,es contains the following
note: " ' V

M ‘."I‘~here.~.is a-n end, named Wlagner,
who might come in for some later in‘-
spe‘cti,on from those, desiring to estab-
lish an a.ll-Amferica,n or "all-eastern
team. He ldoe_stn’t display his wares
under the standards ‘of Harvard, Yale,
"Princeton or Penn,{ but " those who

’ have «seen the Pittsburgh teamat. ’

work wri-teeus that he has something
on any end in the east. The fact that
his name is Wagner and that he hails
.from ‘Pittsburgh is -sufficient to insure
his ultimate status among the ‘.350
class”,  P

 Lthis venerable building which had been
' ' such ‘a-source of pride and promise of‘ A

future progress. to those strong-
hearited, earnest old fathers of ours,
is being razed tomake way for large
civic improvements. While _dern'ol1sh-

sturdy artisans long since dead; a tin

in the rubble just" behind the belt

rusted and ugly with all, it neverthe-
less, containedobjects which are_b6~
yond value tothe University of Pitts-
burgh, both from historical and from
a sentimental point of view. The box
was brought to the office of the
Alumni Association in State Hall On

Thursday afternoon, and the crumb-A

ling lid cut away. It contained for

the most part,4 local, secular and re— ,

ligious papers printed in August and
September, 1854, but its Pflfrie Object
was a1 tattered catalogueof the West-
ern University dated 1822 and bearing
this title: “The Systemoff Education,

i tains the oﬂicial list of the Board of

Trustees, the ‘members of the Build-
Architect and
.Contractors, and an estimate of the
cost of -the structure. The building
committee was composed of General

‘J.’ K,.lMorehead, Rev. D. H. Riddle,

John Harper, Esq., and Dr.  G. Ed-
rington. The estimated cost of ‘the

' -building was fifteen thousand dollars,
the cost of the ground eight thousand

Another valuable historical docu-
ment. 'is'a booklet, issued by order of

the Board of Trustees, containing the

addresses deliverediat the dedication
of the ill-fated University ‘building
on Duqu-esne way, September eighth,
1846. The University authorities pres-
ent on that occasion were Reverend
Daniel H. Riddle, D. D., principal of
the University; Rev. George Upfold,
‘D.iD.; the president, Rev. Andrew W.
Black; the secretary, and Hon. Wm.
H. Denny, M.‘D., the treasurer of the
Board" of Trustees. _
< The -simple exercises were -begun
with an introductory address by Dr.
Upfold. He said in part: ' . .
“This building erected in the place

of’ the former ediﬁce on Third street, ,

ration -of April, .1845, we are assem-

to the exercises of the occasion, it

priate in me,'from the official station
I have the honor to occupy, to say a
few brief words. in relation to the past
efforts of the Trustees in this _impor-
tant cause, and to their. present pur-
poses and expectations.

“The institution entrusted‘to our
supervision is designated in its char-
acter "as iuniversali ‘The VVestern
Universit of Pennsylvania,’ to distin-
guish it rom thetime honored sem-
inary at Philadelphia, known as the
University of Pennsylvania. The name
implies strictly a seminary of_learn-

most extensive facilities for the ac-

“As soon as possible (after the de-
struction -of the University building
April lOt_‘h,_l845) a site was puréhased
for ‘rebuilding, and about a year ago
this edifice was commenced which,
through, the attention and. exertions
of the Building ‘Committee, p,§rticu_

larly of their faithful and indefatiga-

ble Chairman, D11. Edrington, has
b_€t‘.n completed on the very; day spe-
ciﬁed_ in the contract, and in a sub-
stantial and workmanlike manner,,
which ‘does great credit to the super-
intendent, Mr. McCl-elland, and to the
-sk1_lfu.l contract-or, Mr. Kelly. The
bulldlﬂg is larger, more commodious
and far better adapted to its purpose
than _the- former ediﬁce": affording
capacious and conveniently arranged
rooms for the preparatory school, the
several college classes, thelaw school,
theliterary societies -and other depart-
ments of science and art which may
been. or _ may be, introduced.
Thmugh the kind providence of God-

-the..buil'ding has been completed with-

out the slighest accident to any of
the workmen employed. It has been.
paid for out of the funds in _the cus-
tody of the trustees derived from an
Insurance of lim-ited am-ourit, happily
afTected_ on ‘the former building a
short time previous to the ﬁre, and
from th-e_proceeds‘ of the sale of the
former site, and iisialtogether unen-
cumbered with any debt” "‘ - * *

“The Trustees regard the present
Occasion as one of mutual congratu-
citizens. and
Their efforts have been"
crowned with success beyond their
expectation, and the future is bright
and radiant in promise. They are not
lnseflsible to the Great and Beneﬁ-cent
And. to se-

their su-perv‘ision.that Divine blessing
which it hath eminently enjoyed in its

recent adversities, and without which ' A

it cannot be expected to succeed. and
prosper, before proceeding to listen
to the address to be delivered". by the
Rev. Dr. Riddle, they invite this re-
spected audience to unite with them
in an invocation of the continued
blessing of Almighty God, by .a ven-
erablc friend: long and honorably con-

nected with the University in former

days as a member of its faculty, who
has kindly consented to discharge
this duty, the Rev.‘ Dr. Black."
FOHOWIHS the prayer by Rev.‘.Sam-
ucl W. Black, Principal Riddle was
introduced andgspoke eloquently upon
t0p1’c_, “Sound and Saizctiﬁed
S_cholarship.” After reviewing the’
history of the University, he made
an eloquent plea forthe preservation
of the ‘learning and genius bequeathed
by _t-he past, and prophesied that edu-
cation should at some future time or-
Sanize _the vast energies of mind and
action in America into a homogeneous
and permanent national culture. His
address ended with these words . “Our
City has heretofore. been iisefull and
honorably known_ and ‘distinguished,’
O1'_heI' mercantile and manufacturing

_well. But she must do her part also
in a nobler work, conserving and
carrying forward the great interests
of our race.

.A1lour energies must i

 

notwbee expended in ‘elaborating our
mineral resources into useful 0
and fabrics. We. must have a higher

7 ambition, than to be rich in manufac-

tures, and ﬁrst rate tran~spoi‘ters of

There -is -a character which

must form for itse'lf—and now is our

Rformative period. We have past, or
i are rapidly passing the first state in

accumulative capital. We are ap-
proaching the more important crisis
of its application. Our mercliaiits and
manufacturers are, or soon will be,
princes! We must-learn to use our
wealth, in drawing out the ore of
mind, by.educational ‘processes, as

‘ thorough as our ‘appliances of iron

elaboration, into the rig—htl_stuff'for
the practical purposes of life; We

_must rear some mental moiiuments—-——“ .

“To. this end, this Uiiiversity, must

stand! The'li-teraryand scientiﬁc ma-
terial of our twin cities, existing in a

crude st-ate, must hefe find a place of.
, concentration and fusion-;~-.wh<.re’ gen-

erous rivalry and sharp attrition will
serve to brighten and develop what
otherwise might be- dormant and use-
less. This University should be-—and
can we not make it so—the place, not
merely where children and youth may
be educated, but whence the niatured
reﬂections of our most cultivated
minds might go forth to mold, reﬁne
and elevate our citizensl. ’

“With high gratiﬁcation, we realize
our present circumstances; and with
high anticipations, , though c.liaste_i_ied

fr-om the Historical Address. of ex-
Chancellor _I-Iolland, delivered on the
-occasion of the One Hundred Twenty-
ﬁfth Anniversary of the University

:Charter_Grant, February 28, 1912. '

“In 1845,,on the 10th day of April,
the City of Pittsburgh was visited by
a terrible disaster. Almost the entire

city was consumed by fire, and -among

house of the principaladjoining it.
Unfortunately the records,‘ which had
beenkept from 1787 to .1845, perished
in ‘the ﬂames.
work of your historian has been made
vastly laborious. Steps were imme-
diately taken to rebuild upon a new
site-sitiiated upon ‘Duquesne way. Bu-t
in 1849, when the second building had
scarcely been completed, it likewise
fell prey to tire, and thei;'eafte.i', in pur-
suarice of a policy which we now

-know to have been mistaken and re-

grettable, the work ofinstruction was
temporarily ‘abandoned, and the
ni-oneys of the University were in-

vested and allowed to accumulate.

“Among those who failed to grad-

uate because of the temporary-sus-"-

pension of the University were a num-
ber of men who rankhigh in the an-

nals of American citizenship. Among‘

them'I ﬁnd the names -of our honored

fellow-townsman, Professor Matthew»

B. Riddle, to-day the only survivor of
the British and Americans Coinniittee-s
of the Revision of the Translation of
the New Testament; of General A._ C.

McClurg, in his .time the leading pub— .

lisher in Chicago; and of Wzishingtoii
Roebling, to -whom fell the task of
completing the. beautiful structure
spanning the East River between New
‘York. and Brooklyn, of which his dis-
tinguished father was th-edesigner.
“During -the period from 1849 until-
steps were taken in 1853 to revive the

ework of the. institution, the 17'-oardgof

Trustees continued to hold meetings,
and the. Rev; David H. Riddle, the
pastor ,of the Third 1 Presbyterian
Church, acted as principal in order to

attend to any matters'relatiii‘g to the “

body of alumni which might require
attention. In 1853 a site at the corner
of.Ross and Diamond streets was se-
cured‘, and steps’were taken to erect
a new building, which still stands to-
day. Rev. Dr. John F. McLar_en, D. D.,
was chosen as the principal. It was
in- the dark and troublesome days of
the panic of 1857 that the WOl‘1{’_0f ‘in-
struction was commenced. A large
body of students was gathered. Dr.
