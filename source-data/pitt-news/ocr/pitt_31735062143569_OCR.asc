cussi-on-. Professor A1exand_er'.__ Sil-
verman, president of‘ the Faculty
Club, as'chai'z-man, spoke briefly ‘on
"Selective Instruction,” " emphasizuing

'.-the ' fact that educational methods

must lay more stress on’ individual
differences, - allowing ‘superior -credit
for quantity of work well done, and
largely eliminating the-_ lecture meth-
od in ‘favor of conferences, outside
reading,’ and laboratory’ work. Pro-
fessor AKarl D. Swartzel‘ described
the- experiment which is being_ con-
ducted. in the Mathematics depart-
ment of "‘sectionizin‘g” certain ‘class-

es and ‘giving more credits to the

section which advances more rapidly.

-J. Steele Gow, executive secretary
of the University, compared the sys-
tems which have been adopted at
various American. institutions to
stimulate and co-ordinate the intel-
lectual life of the student, these be-

tern at Princeton, the tutorial system
of Harvard, and the honor system at
S‘warthmo're.— At Princeton- every stu-
dent has a -preceptor for each of his
courses, -not ‘a. member of the teach-
ing faculty, who -meets the students

.in- small informal. groups, to discuss

the ‘student’s reading and work in
connection .with his courses. This
syjstem is costly and has some dis-
_advantages. The Harvard__systeIn
has -been evolved to secure _co,ncen_-A
tration‘_ under the 'e1ectroa’l system
leading up to “general ex~an1/iI1vat.i0IlS”'
in the. senior year, based on the work
‘of the entire four years and requir-
ing. an outlook on -thehwhole body of.
knowledgef Each student. is assign-’
ed atutor, in’the_ﬁeld -of his concen-
tration only, who stays ‘. with. him
throughout the four -years and‘. who
generally -is-a,{.membei'. of the faculty.
The objective of the tutorial work is
not  conﬁned ‘ narrowly‘ to . depart-

ments. The system has ‘-vastly in-

creased ‘the amount of reading-land

serious study ofthé student body and
30 pe,r_.ce1_1_t' of the senior are candi-
dates for_gde‘grees with distinction, re‘-
quiring . a: -thesis -prepared under‘ the
supervision of the tutor; All of these
systems -gra‘nt'the student great in-
but require_-._ more
work and closer guidance. .. _ ,

Dean W. W.- Charters of the gradu-

ate school spoke -on “Building on the

Junior: C_'olle'ge”. ‘UHe ' described _the
grow_th'~ of the junior colleges since

V the ﬁl‘SlZ such "department was organ.-_A,.

Last year_ over two hundred West-
ern Pennsylvanian swimmers com-
peted. for ‘their’ various schools, and‘
early indications this year point to
almost twice that many entries this
year. V _ "

Allegheny High _ school won the
championship last year. Wright and
Hough were the big guns in the meet
for the North Si‘der_s and "practically;
won the meet between them" by. their
ﬁne" work. This year without Wright,‘-
who is now Vcaptainof the Pitt Frosh;
natators, and ‘I-Iough, the Alleghenians
will have a.’hard..time;defending their.
title. - A -V . _.  z  

The swimming champions last sea-
son were given further‘ glory when‘
four records fell. Matthewsoof "Pitts-V,
burgh Academy swam wild and broke
the records in b_oth"the 40 .and 100-
yard backstroke events, while V— Wright
broke the oldV‘mark"' in the 40-yard
free style and his teammate Hough
‘copped honors‘ in-,'the_ plunge. , Mat-_
thews is at-Shadyside‘ Academy this
year and will defend his titles in the
Pitt meet in April. As Matthews has
been going line of late it would not
be at all surprising to see him "win
more honors; .-There is a ﬁne array
of natators in the Western-Pennsyl-’
vania high schools and, prep schools
this year and the water sp,or_t,has been
booming as it never has before. _

Scltenley will be defending the re-
lay title won last year. A beautiful
trophy especially made for the Pan-'.
ther meetis ‘at’ stake. in" this race.»
The Schenley team cannot boast of
the same team that it -presented" last
year, yet‘ it has developed anew team
of unusual strength and ability.. " V

The Junior high schools of the city
will no_t~be._left out in. the cold when
