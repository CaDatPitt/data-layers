CWO kicks

Ribbon

On Dec. 6, 1989 Marc Lepine
walked into a Montreal engi-
neering school, pulled out a
gun and killed 14 women while
shouting, “-1 hate feminists.”

Yesterday Pitt’s Campus
\X/omen’s Organization handed
out white ribbons in the \X/illiam
Pitt Union as a part of the White
Ribbon Campaign to keep those
women’s memories alive.

The campaign is also the
largest world-wide men’s
protest against violence to
women.

“It’s a symbolic action more
than anything else,” said Shira
Hassan, the president of CWO.
“It would be nice to think that
this Campaign would change
things, but that would be utopi-
an.

“There are many men who
are opposed to violence against
women, but they’re afraid to
speak out. Men don’t really
want to admit that it [violence
against womenl happens. The
fact is that it does,” she said.

Hassan said she believes that
a lot of the problems stem from

Srno/eers can quit with UPMC research program

By Peter Knezevich
For The Pitt News

Are you trying to quit smoking and fed
up with conventional methods? The
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has
some encouraging news for those of you
who are.

Since October, UPMC has been testing a
new nicotine nasal spray. The spray, devel-
oped in the mid—’8()s by Pitt, is designed to
help smokers cope with psychological
withdrawal symptoms.

The research includes a three-week pro-
gram along with counseling sessions. James
Grobe and Kenneth A. Perkins, both of

Economist says students

UPMC, have been doing ‘much of the
research, and both agreed that the spray
could be beneficial when dealing with seri-
ous nicotine withdrawal.

The spray enables them to map out each
person’s psychological pattern involving
nicotine. After a pattern is discovered,
patients can better deal with habits that
caused the original addiction.

Although still in a testing mode, Grobe
called early results “successful.” However,
he also added, “No drug in itself can stop
nicotine addiction.” Both researchers also
agreed that counseling sessions are needed
to fight the initial withdrawal symptoms.

They both said that “taking the spray for

the first time is similar to someone having
their first cigarette.” They described burning
and redness as two minor irritations.

The researchers said “the drug will not be
available in the U.S. anytime soon.” Due to
the Food and Drug Administration and
other outside forces, it will be awhile until
the spray can be bought or prescribed.

“Europe has approved the spray, but their
regulations are not as stiff as the US,” said
Perkins.

Healthy smokers are welcome to partici-
pate in the program and should contact
UPMC. A refundable 375 deposit is required
to participate and will be returned upon
completion of the study.

If you’re worried that you’re
going to graduate without a job,
fear not, or not so much. The
U.S. economy is getting better,
according to Pitt economics
professor Reuben Slesinger, and
by taking a few precautionary
steps, you can increase your
marketability in the work force.

“Students need a varied back—-
ground,” Slesinger said. “They

need to be ﬂexible enough and
have the knowledge to take a
job outside their field.”
Slesinger said logic, writing
and qualitative analysis are the
three fundamentals all students
should have in their back-
ground. “You need the ability of
students to express yourself and
to think logically,” he said.
Internships can also help stu-
dents land a job by giving them
“poise” and non-academic
experience, Slesinger said. “You

learn how to behave, work, act
and dress.”

Some positive signs that the
economy is pulling out of the
recession are the non-rising
inﬂation rates and stable interest
rates, but the lack of higher-
paying jobs will cause the econ-
omy to rise at a sluggish rate.

Slesinger said certain fields,
such as those which serve the
public, are growing faster than
technical, production or health-
related fields.

“Most industries are doing a
lot of restructuring,” Slesinger
said. “They overexpanded in
areas several years ago and now
they’re"looking things over, cut-
ting what they don’t need.”

Slesinger said that computer
majors are having a hard time
finding work because there are
so many college graduates with
computer degrees and simply
not enough jobs to go around.

The law field is another area
which has not been and is not

. At Bill Clinton’s inauguration

indication, Pasquale’s choice of
poetry had less to do with
excitement about Angelou’s

‘One day at a time’ key to resolutions that work

You are probably already
beginning to slip a little on your
New Years resolutions. A month
from now they will probably be
forgotten. Since this pattern
repeats itself over and over again
for most of us, why do we both-
er to make resolutions? One
answer is that we are not happy
with some aspects of our lives,
and although our follow—through
is often weak, our plans to
change begin with good inten-
tions and much optimism.

There are many reasons why
we don’t or can’t keep our reso-
lutions. Among the most com-
mon are choosing goals that stir
up underlying fears that impede
our progress, choosing goals that
are too general in nature and
choosing goals that go beyond
our present ability to achieve.
Sometimes all three of these dif-
ficulties may be encountered
within one resolution.

Take for instance the seeming-
ly straightforward resolution of
determining to be a better stu-
dent next term. This worthy

resolve may be doomed to fail-
ure if not examined more close-
ly. Some students, for example,
are terrified of discovering that
there are limits to their abilities.
Con—sequently, they never go all
out for fear that
they may not
do well and
will be forced
to face their _
limitations.
They consider 
it better to 
blame their fail- _
ure on some 
other factor 
such as a pro- '
crastination problem. The solu-
tion to this problem is somewhat
elusive and may require some
counseling assistance to ade-
quately address.

The plan to become a better
student is also too general a
goal. The chance of success is
greatly enhanced by addressing
the speciﬁc things that good stu-
dents do; attend class regularly,
ask questions, take good notes,

 

establish a regular study sched-
ule, etc. Breaking a general goal
into sub—goals that are clearly
achievable is an effective strate-
gy. A resolution may also fail be-
Ocause a basic skill needed for
success is
lacking. In
this in-
stance the
resolution
to be a bet-
ter student
must begin
with a real-
istic assess-
ment of
skills, fol-
lowed perhaps by a visit to the
Learning Skills Center or to the
Writing Workshop for special-
ized assistance.

Whatever goals you establish,
whether they are to become
more social, to lose weight, to
become more assertive or to
overcome some basic fear, take
time to think about the core
issues that interfered with your
achievement of these goals in

the past. Then establish some
concrete, achievable goals, work
on the"skills needed to achieve
them and don’t be afraid to ask
for help.

An even more eﬁicient way of
making progress toward your
personal goals is to take a little
time each morning to make
some daily resolutions. Just for
that day resolve to speak up for
yourself, to eat healthier, to hug
someone, to exercise a little, to
take a risk, to enjoy yourself, to
face something you fear with
courage, to make it a day you
can be proud of when you go to
bed that night. It’s easy enough
to tell yourself what you are
going to do next month. What
will really make a difference in
your life is holding yourself
accountable for your daily com-
mitments. It ties in with an old
aphorism, “Yard by yard life is
hard, but inch by inch life’s a
cinch.” Welcome/to another
New Year and another chance to
become the master of your reso-
lutions.

All about

Billy Joel makes friends at the Civic Arena last night

By Steve Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

Billy Joel made some new friends at
his Civic Arena concert last night.

“Our seats were the worst,” first-
year student Anne Ryan said after the
concert. “But this guy came up to us
before the concert and asked if we
wanted to sit closer to the stage.”

Anne Ryan and her friends, Julie
Fisher and Melissa Wright, got more
than just a little closer to the stage.
They were led by some unknown
man to the first two rows in front of
the stage.

“I couldn’t believe it,” Ryan said.
“We were 10 feet away from him.”

"We even got to touch him,” Ryan
said. referring to Joel, who came over
several times to shake audience mem-
bers’ hands and even sing to them
face-to—face at one point.

“I’ve been to a lot of concerts, but
this was the best,” Wright said.

After belting out a couple of crowd
favorites, Joel brought up another
Pittsburgh connection.

“In 1976, I came to Pittsburgh to
open up for the Doobie Brothers,”
Joel told the sold-out Civic Arena
crowd. “It was at a place called the
Syria Mosque.”

Joel said that while the Doobie
Brothers were popular during most of

soul

the tour, he remained pretty much an
unknown.

“Here I was playing ‘Piano Man’
and nobody knew who I was,” Joel
said, “until we got to Pittsburgh." Joel
said that for some unknown reason
the audience in Pittsburgh knew who
he was and liked him.

Joel started off the concert with
three of the first four songs from
his latest album River of Dreams
before leading into several crowd
favorites such as “Scenes from an

Italian Restaurant,” “We Didn't Start 

the Fire” and “It's Still Rock and Roll
to Me.”

The two-hour-plus show ended 
with a shoeless Joel dancing on his 
baby grand piano singing “Only the 

Good Die Young” and then an encore

of two more crowd favorites, “Big " 

Shot” and “Piano Man”. “M I favorite

part was “Piano Man” when every-

body was swaying together and  

singing,” Pitt sophomore Laurie .

Seiman said.

“Piano Man” is one of Joel’s most =

successful and popular songs and the

' crowd proved it with their loudest

cheers and screams of the night.

Thousands swayed and sang
together as Joel finished the concert
by not singing the final verse, instead
deciding to let the crowd finish it,
which they did.

From his new office on the
eighth floor, Interim Provost
and Senior Vice Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg surveys Pitt’s
campus on a cold, late autumn
afternoon, the overcast sky cast-
ing a spell of dormancy over
students.

Neither the weather nor the
mood it induces warrants a sec-

_ ond glance from Nordenberg

however.

He does not have time.

He is in the office at 6:50 a.m.
almost every morning, attends
between four and five meetings
a day and makes the time to lis-
ten to problems people bring
before him concerning planning
and budgeting at Pitt. Three
stacks of mail piled at least a
foot high on his desk are still
beckoning to him.

A wooden-ancl—brass scale, a
traditional symbol of justice, sits
behind Nordenberg as he works

at his desk, a constant reminder
of balance, fairness and hon.-
esty.

At the end of his hectic day,
Nordenberg, 45, still looks
fresh. His shirt still radiates
whiteness and crispness, his tie
remains knotted and his cuffs
buttoned. An energetic bounce
in his walk, boasts, “I’m ready to
confront the next problem com-
ing down the bureaucratic high-
way. Bring it on.”

His reluctance to say no to
anything asked of him has
sparked an involved and suc-
cessful career at Pitt.

Nordenberg started at Pitt as a
visiting assistant professor of
law in 1977.

- In 1984, the graduating class
of the law school selected him
to be the first recipient of the
Student Bar Association’s
Excellence—in-Teaching award.
The following year he received
the Chancellor’s Distinguished
Teaching Award, given to a
selected professor on a universi-

ty-wide scale.

In 1985, Nordenberg accepted
the position of associate dean
for academic affairs. Five
months later he assumed the
position of acting dean of the
law school. In 1987,
Nordenberg was selected dean.

During his time as dean, he
was widely credited with
improving the quality and diver-
sity of the student body, raising
the number of contributions
from school alumni, adding
clinical programs and enriching
course offerings.

Despite the grueling schedule
of being the dean of the law
school, he continued to be
devoted to his teaching duties.

In his final semester as dean,
Nordenberg was scheduled to
teach one section of Civil
Procedure. When teachers
could not be found to teach the
other two scheduled sections,
he added those two sections,
tripling his course load.

Not everything has gone

however.

Controversy swirled around
Nordenberg last spring when
Candice Hoke, a professor in
the law school, was denied
tenure by Provost Donald
Henderson after the faculty of
the law school voted to approve
granting her tenure.

Students of the law school
protested the decision, claiming
Nordenberg had a personal
vendetta against Hoke due to
her outspoken criticism of the
administration.

After eight years as dean of

the law school, Nordenberg was A

ready to return to his true loves
—— research, writing and teach-
ing.

“Speaking personally, there
are special rewards to a faculty
members life," Nordenberg
said. “I felt it was time to leave

while.” ‘>

  Nordenbergﬁnds time to be interim provost omdfatber

when Henderson announced he
was retiring as provost of Pitt.

Nordenberg was asked to
serve as interim provost until a
new one could be found.

“I certainly did not take it
because -of the hours this posi-
tion requires of me,” he said. “I
felt I could make a contribution
back to the university. That
appealed to me.

“Hardly an hour goes past

that I don’t learn something

new. I have a broad sense of
responsibility.”

A broad sense of responsibili-
ty epitomizes Nordenbergs life,
both at Pitt and at home.

According to his wife Nikki,
he is thoroughly committed to
his family.

“He is always there for our
two sons, who are actively
involved in soccer, basketball
and swimming,” she said. “He
never misses the kids’ events.”

Nordenberg said that the
secret behind her husband’s
success is his ability to balance
his responsibilities both at Pitt
and home.

He works early morning
hours so that he can come
home at a reasonable time to
his family. He helps his sons
with their homework and plays
one-on-one basketball with
them. .

“He is what you see. No one
works harder than Mark.”

According to Vice Provost
Robert F. Pack, Nordenberg is a
man who knows what he wants
to accomplish, and he is effec-
tive in accomplishing what he
sets out to do.

The University Planning and
Budget Committee ‘was an
extraordinary accomplishment,
Pack said.

According to a statement
released from the provost’s
office, the next fiscal year is
planned and has been estab-
lished, “committed to the goal
of being as fair and responsive
as possible.”

The effectiveness of the UPBC
has been enhanced by the way
Nordenberg chairs it, Pack said.
The material is presented in a
systematic way. discussions are
kept to the point and issues are
not recurring constantly.

According to Nordenberg, he
realized that his single biggest
challenge was the task of lead-
ing the planning and budgeting
efforts for a stronger and better
university.

He is quick to attribute some
of the success with the UPBC to

BiGALA has hopes of future office space in WPU

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

Members of the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance have
been hoping for new office
space for the past two years.

— This year, they may get their

wish.
BiGALA co-President Sacha
Layos said she has met

with Director of Student
Activities Joe Cavalla, and
that he mentioned giving

 
 

new space to the organiza-
tion.

“He brought up the fact that
they’re going to keep a
promise to us and get us new
space,” Layos said.

She also noted that she
had been approached by
Student Government Board
member Elizabeth Mania, who
said that BiGALA’s need for
space was an important issue
to her.

“Last year there was a big

fight over office space for eight
months, and the space was
assigned to the Campus
\X/omen’s Organization,” Layos
said.

“I don’t want to say soon,
but it looks like we’ll be
getting more space some-
time within the next
year.”

BiGALA is also presently
working with the Office
of Residence Life and
New Student Programs to

include gay, bisexual and les-
bian information into the pro-
grams students receive when
they first arrive at the universi-
ty.

“\X/e’re thinking about
putting some stuff in about P-
Flag (a homosexual support
group), and a pamphlet about
having a gay roommate,” said
Layos.

BiGALA started the se-
mester with its first meeting
last night.

SGB

Continued from page 1
we begin our year of service to the uni-
versity and its students.”

The new board is replacing nine people
who contributed in part to the tradition
about which Pasquale spoke.

1993 SGB President Jacob Brody said

by taking office, the new board is doing
what he felt all students should do: Get
involved.
. “Your education at Pitt is not about just
attending classes,” Brody said. “It’s about
getting involved, whether you serve on
SGB, organize a protest, volunteer to tutor
at a local high school or [be] an athlete. In
some way... you’re making an impact.”

Brody urged the board to approach the
challenges of their new offices with
courage. C

“You have a great challenge ahead of
you,” the former president said. “Grasp it.
Take charge of it. Don’t ever look back-
ward, but keep looking forward.”

New board member Heath Golden said
one of the bigger challenges facing the
1994 board is deciding what exactly it
wants to accomplish.

“Everyone here has so many ideas that
prioritizing them and getting them done
one-at—a—time is almost a challenge,”

Golden said. “You have so many people
planning so many different things.”

Pasquale said if the new board rises to
the challenge of maintaining consistency,
it will be able to execute its job more easi-
ly.

“We have to remain focused and renew
our commitment constantly to the jobs
we’ve taken on,” he said. “I think if you
do that, and if all the details are taken care
of, then the big picture falls into place
quite nicely.”

Pasquale said he emphasized this type
of commitment during the SGB’s recent
leadership retreat.

“The retreat cleared up a lot of things 
I think we basically put everything that
happened during the election behind us,”
Pasquale said.

“Now, we’re very focused on being a
group of nine people who are strongly
committed to one another and to the job
we took on.” .

Of course, when anything new comes
in, something has to go out.
Recently-departed board member Brian
Bolton, a piece of the 1993 SGB’s “big pic-
ture,” said board members will grow clos-
er as time goes on.

“Last year, at first, there was some ten-

sion [among the board members] with the
retreat and everything,” he said. “But once
we all got to know each other you make
friends you’ll have hopefully forever.”

Outgoing board member Joe Foner said
his year on the 8GB was not all fun and
games, but he still found it to be a satisfy-
ing experience.

“When you go into these things you
have expectations and they always seem
to get shattered right from the beginning
 you always have to figure out new
things to do,” Foner said.

“You never know if your project is
going to die or actually come to fruition,
but everytime I made some progress there
was that good feeling that I did what was
expected of me.”

According to Pasquale, the new board
members have been doing what is expect-
ed of them too.

“I’m greatly encouraged by what I have
seen of my peers thus far,” Pasquale said.
“But potential is not enough. The nine of
us must remain focused  and we must
remain confident in ourselves and one
another.”  

“This potential is nothing without the

men. “They have to be tough,
abrasive people and this is just
not true. [Showing interest in a
women’s group] would make
them appear sensitive. God for-
bid they appear sensitive.”

“Last year we had a wonder-
ful reaction to the campaign.
You just have to ask people to
participate. They [men] all feel it

on the inside.”

Hassan described CWO as
being “inclusive. We have one
of the highest percentages of
men of any women’s group in
the area  There are at least
five men who come to every
meeting and 10 who show up
on—and-off. That’s more people
than some organizations have
in them collectively.”

According to an article by
Michelle Landsberg, not every-
one is thrilled about the White
Ribbon Campaign. “When the
White Ribbon Campaign recent-
ly asked leading feminists to act
as advisors, one young cynic
muttered, ‘So now that they’ve
got their Little League team,
they want us to sponsor their T-
shirts and cheer for them.”’

Also in Landsberg’s article is a
description of then-Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
wearing a white ribbon when
he has “lheadedl a conservative
government whose remorseless
budget-slashing has inflicted
immense harm on women and
children.”

“What this campaign does,”
said Hassan, “is speak out
against violence against
women.”

On a different subject, Hassan
discussed CWO’s telephone ser-
vice which has been in opera-
tion for several months now.

“I’d expected a lot of calls but
we haven’t done much in terms
of publicity.”

According to Hassan, the
phone service is designed to
give women the “Who’s,
What’s, Where’s, Why’s and
When’s for women’s concerns
 It was designed to serve as a
nucleus of information for
women” since there is nothing
in existence to do that.

Hassan was quick to point
out that it is not a help line. “We
can direct you to a help line,
but that’s all.”

All calls are confidential and
the number can be called at any
time. According to Hassan, the
caller is guaranteed to get a call
back if their call is not heard by
an operator. The number is 648-
4863.

Stay on the courts

On Monday, the National College Athletic
Association voted down a measure to increase the
number of men’s college basketball scholarships for
Division I schools from 13 to 14. The Black Coaches
Association has planned a boycott of basketball games.
They believe that an extra scholarship per school
would be beneficial to minority students and that
denying these scholarships would shut out almost 300
athletes from college. The rancor of these coaches is
misplaced. According to the NCAA, only 15 players
per school were on scholarship last year (USA Today).
According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, the NCAA also
deferred a request to increase gymnastic scholarships,
the only request that would increase opportunities for
women, until next year. All of this is part of a cost—cut—
ting program the NCAA is conducting. In light of this,
it would appear that the Black Coaches Association is
merely being a poor sport. ,

There is no guarantee that, if the extra scholarship
were in place, it would be given to minority students.
Another scholarship simply means more opportunity
for all players, including those who come from afﬂuent
backgrounds. However, it is certain that other sports
would have to count the cost for another‘ basketball
scholarship.There are many other athletes who want to
further their education, and despite the fact that they
don’t receive as much media coverage, they are just as
deserving as basketball players. Aside from athletes,
there are many other talented students who could use
financial support to further their education. There are
artists, musicians and academically-gifted students
about whom the Black Coaches Association doesn’t
seem to care. They should channel some of the energy
from this boycott into finding out how to aid minority
students whose talents do not lie in athletics.

In addition, the NCAA has already agreed to let play-
ers enter the NBA draft without losing their college eli-
gibility. With this option, it is likely that players who
receive promising offers from the pros will enter the
NBA. This would leave room for other players to take
their place. S

Finally, the NCAA has agreed to bring the issue up
again in 1995. While there may be deserving athletes

I who will lose the option to enter Division I schools,

there will be other divisions who can accept these stu-
dents. The current climate doesn’t permit the addition
of another scholarship, and the coaches should under-
stand this.So instead of walking off the job, the coach-
es should stay in and help the students they have do
the best they can, and they should not interfere with
the season. Other sports are having to tighten their
belts, so basketball should do their share until things
improve. They‘ have not lost anything and stand to
gain in the future. Instead of attempting to disrupt the
system, they should be looking ahead.

Lambda Chi Alpha offers apology for any offense

The brothers of Lambda Chi
Alpha offer our sincere apolo-
gies to anyone who was
offended by our recent rush
posters. Our intention was not
to offend or demean women
in any way, shape or form.
We were unaware that any-
one would take offense
at the use of the posters, as
we have been using them
to promote our rush schedule
for the past five years. In
that time, there was never
a complaint from The Pitt
News, the Inter-Fraternity
Council or the Campus
Women’s Organization. Rest
assured that if we had received
a complaint fromthese, or
any other groups about our
rush poster, we would have
discontinued their use irnmedi—
ately.

In reference to the assertion
by The Pitt News Editorial
Board that we chose to ignore
IFC regulations‘ pertaining to
the content of rush posters, we
have this to say: We did not
intentionally violate IFC regula-
tions whatsoever. The problem

arose from a series of miscom-
munications between Lambda
Chi Alpha, the IFC and the
entire Greek community.
Lambda Chi Alpha wholeheart-
edly supports the IFC rush reg-
ulations, and agrees with the
suggestions made by The Pitt
News Editorial Board concern-

ing awareness and review of all
IFC policies. -
However, Lambda Chi Alpha,
and undoubtedly the entire Pitt
Greek system, takes offense to
the Editorial Board’s references
to “drop in the keg” and the
reported length of time that the
posters were supposedly in cir-

culation. In regards to the

“keg” comment, Lambda Chi
Alpha was the first fraternity to
adopt an alcohol policy ban-

ning the use of kegs at any fra-
ternity function. Furthermore,
this Phlicy was adopted by the
Pitt IFC after it had already
been implemented in our chap-
ter. Secondly, the posters were

up for approximately eight 8

hours, not for a “few days,”
before we were directed to
take them down.

In conclusion, Lambda Chi
Alpha. Would a.ga.in......9..f.f§:i
our apologies to anyone
who took offense at our
rush poster. We feel The
Pitt News Editorial Board
misrepresented Lambda Chi
Alpha, the IFC and other Greek
organizations in their irrespon-
sible and uninformed state-
ments concerning the incident.
We hope that in the future The
Pitt News Editorial Board will
take the time to properly
examine and analyze both
sides of an issue before releas-
ing their opinion to the student
body.

Sincerely,

The Brothers
and Associates of Lambda Chi
Alpha

Posters not up to ideals of fraternity

As a University of Oklahoma Lambda Chi, I
found the rush posters posted on campus to be
distasteful and not representative of the high
ideals of Lambda Chi Alpha. Lambda Chi Alpha’s
basis is founded in Christian ideals of high moral
character and integrity. The mistake of the
posters was not in the character of the fraternity
and was quickly rectified by fraternity members
who diligently removed the posters the same
day they were posted.

The slanderous statements by The Pitt News,
however, do represent a deeper and
more resounding problem. In the editorial
section of the ]an.12 issue of The Pitt News,
the Editorial Board implied that Lambda
Chi Alpha used kegs and committed criminal
activity." Neither implication is true. In
1988, Lambda Chi Alpha waslthe first fraternity
to eliminate kegs from their parties. }With respect

to posting a photograph of a clothed woman
being criminal activity, the last time I checked
it was legal to print a picture of people wearing
clothes. The editorial board also erred in
stating that the posters were up for a couple of
days.

Editorials with incorrect facts and false impli-
cations are irresponsible editorials and can dam-
age the positive benefits an organization pro-
vides. In addition to being a pioneer of respon-
sible drinking on campus, Lambda Chi Alpha is
the pioneer of the associateship program, which
replaced the often ‘abused pledgeship system.
Rarely are positive actions reported by The Pitt
News. Lambda Chi Alpha has rectified its mis-
takes, is The Pitt News capable of rectifying its
mistakes? '

While the compact disc mar-
ket has virtually destroyed the
vinyl record industry, some
smaller labels are restoring it.
Simple Machines, a label run by
members of Tsunami —— jenny
Toomey and Kristin Thompson
— provoke their own DIY (Do
It Yourself) attitude. Since 1990,
they have released over 20 
three LPs, seven cassettes, three
CDs, numerous fanzines, T-
shirts and their own 24—page
booklet on making a record or
CD.

During 1993, the Simple
Machines label released a series
of 12 t;wo—band split 7” singles
for each month of the year
called “The Working Holiday
Singles,” featuring Versus, The
Coctails, Small Factory,
Tsunami, Pitchblende, Swirlies,
and Superchunk. As the
December 7” was released, it
marked the end of Working
Holiday singles career and, with
it’s retirement announced, jenny
and Kristin planned a celebra-
tion. Although it was a surprise
to many of the Working Holiday
single community, they had
been planning it for some time.

Jenny said, “We worked on it
for six months, slowly. We con-
tacted the bands six months
ago, figured out what space we
could use, how much it would
cost, how much we were going
to pay them, all that stuff and
began working it out. How
many tickets we had to sell to
make the salary for the bands.”

“But it has only been a lot of
work for the past two weeks

5i
and the last three days in partic-
ular. We have alot of hard-
working people on staff. I don’t
have to work the door, sell the
merchandise. We have people
who are trustworthy.”

“The Working Holiday
Festival” was etched for Jan. 7-9
at The Black Cat, in Washington,
D.C. The Friday night show fea-
tured Chicago’s The Coctails,
who were now known as
“Lollapalooza Best Lounge
Band." Marking their beginnings
at The Art Institute of Kansas
City, their certain jazz inﬂuences
created a toe—tapping ambiance.
Dressed in black suits and ties,
they certainly pushed the crowd
forward. The poetry of David
Greenberger and the Tinklers’
homemade instruments promot-
ed a different norm than the
indie—rockish festival theme.

Saturdays melodies crossed a
much louder barrier. Heavy
indie-punksters jawbox, Crain,
Swirlies, Archers of Loaf, and
Superchunk provided musical
adrenaline, although Eggs
offered a break between the
haze and sunshine of feedback
and distortion. D.C.’s Jawbox
was the first band. The crowd
slim and talkative, they turned

heads as they covered a My Dad .

Is Dead classic “Babe in the
Woods.” Cram and Catapillar
followed along in the footsteps
of Jawbox’s popularity. Eggs, a
local band, challenged the noisy
identities with the additions of a
trombone and bongos to their
band’s instruments. Music was

Yo! I’m back in effect!!! Big up
to my reading audience that
showed much love for the
crates when shizzinizz got thick
last semester. Many of you
showed that I became a big part
of your Thursday reading. I
thank you very much. Now it’s
time to start housin’ it for the
year of 19 ninety 4 (takin’) no-
sh*t!! For those that don’t com-
prehend, from now on we’re
gonna make it & keep it raw!
Big up to my editor Bill K. —— I
know you had nothing to do
with last year’s mix—up; you’ve
always been level. Big up to the
seniors (hell yeah!!) because
we’re almost outta this b**ch!!

Oh, I’m sorry, please excuse
my rudeness. For those of you
who are new to Pitt, let me
introduce myself. I am Blakk
Steel, Rap Music Director of
WPTS FM (98.5, your campus
radio station that has the #1 rap
show in Pgh., Fridays from 9
p.m. - 1 a.m.), one of the hosts
of Underground Hip Hop
Video Magazine (cable’s first
‘R’ rated video show airing
Mondays at 11 p.111. on PCTV
channel 21 or B-side #7), & the
writer of this section of The Pitt
News titled Diggin’ in tha
Crates (in the Showcase section
on Thursdays). From time to
time, I deejay frat parties; but
other than that, I’m your aver-
age bro.

For the most part, this is a rap
record review section that offers
an objective review from a pro-
fessional ghetto standpoint. Our

ratings go on a headphone sys-‘

tem & it goes as follows:

D|GG|N'

@@@@@ — IT’S ALL THAT!!!
@@@@ —— SHO’ ‘NUFF FLA-
VOR!!
@@@ —- GOOD. SHOWIN’
SKILLZ
@@ —— DUB IT FIRST.
@ —- UH-UH!! SAVE THAT
SH*T!!!

(I know they’re not head-
phones, but they’ll have to doll)

For the regulars of this sec-
tion, this week’s DIT C will not
be the usual. Instead, it’ll be
more like the best & worst of
‘93 8: what’s up for ‘94. Also,
when possible, I’ll add what’s
goin’ on in the rap industry
(sometimes it will be courtesy
of the Source Weekly Word).
Without further ado, let’s do
this!! A

The best albums of ‘95 (my

professional objective opinion)

are:

1. Dr. Dre — The Chronic :
Without a doubt the hands
down favorite. Although it was
officially released in ‘92, it was
considered a "93 albtiin. Dre
officially 8; unofficially housed
the market for ‘93.

Triple platinum plus (over 3
million sold)

2. Pharcyde — Bizarre
Ride 11 The Pharcyde : One
of the most slept—on albums in
"93, Production is phat, rhymes
are phat, what more can be
said? If any questions check
Passin’ Me By & Otha Fish.

3. Tha Alkaholiks -— 21 6;
Over : This crew brought it
back to the basics, but still not
receiving the props they
deserve. There’s not a wack

track on this 10 cut album. The
first single should say it all
(Make Room b/w Last Call).

4. Wu-Tang Clan —— Enter
The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)
: Basic flavor served on an
obese platter. Still wrekkin’
shizz with their first single
released over a year ago
(Protect Ya Neck b/w Method
Man).

5. Onyx — Bacdafucup :.

The “mad face invasion” hit
hard in ‘93. They made brothers
throw their gunz up, made
white kids slamdance 8: they
got kinda “shifftee” at the end.
This equalled out to a platinum
plus (over a million sold) debut
album. ‘

6. Geto Boys — Till Death
Do Us Part : Believe it or not,
it’s the best Geto Boys album
yet. It didn’t have any astronom-
ical hits like “My Mind’s Playin’
Tricks On Me”, but it was the
most solid package delivered by
this group. This marked the end
of Scarface’s Geto Boy days.

7. Lords Of The
Underground — Here Come
The Lords : Havoc. That’s-what
The Lords caused in ‘95, thanx
to the musical talents of Marley
Marl. Hit after hit after hit 
(check Funky Child, Chief

Rocka, etc.)

8. A Tribe Called Quest -
Midnight Marauders : The
Questers return with a batch of
funk that keeps things tight.
Following up the Gold plus
(over 500,000 sold) Low End
Theory , Midnight adds new
ﬂavor for the system. Since this
album was released late, we’ll
keep track of how much dam-
age is done.

9. Erick Sermon -— No
Pressure : The “Green—Eyed
Bandit" makes his solo debut
making a solid rumble on the
underground. With his trade-
mark sound, we’re looking for-
ward to more albums from him.

10. A_,.three way tie between

Biz Markie —~ All
Samples Cleared

De La Soul ——

Some of the worst of ‘93:

Sneekemuthafukaz : They
ﬂunked the school of Onyx.
_ 9. Trendz Of Culture —
T rendz... : “Even though they
walk through the valley of the

8. Pete Nice & Daddy Rich

—  Dust to Dust : 3rd Bass
‘should really get back together

7. Funk Doobiest — Which
Doobie U Be? : “Knick knack
Doobie wack, give them kids
some skills; then maybe they
can give us some thrills.”

6. Tim Dog—DoorDie : If
KRS-One cannot save the career
that D] Quik put bullet holes in,
then his record makin’ days
should be over. Beeeeeeeep.

5. C.E.B. —— Countin’
Endless Bank : Philly was ill
represented with this album. I
personally know there’s talent
there. The initials should stand
for “Creatln’ Excessive

4. Too Much Trouble —

3. 5th Ward Boyz - 5th of

 . . . Star
So Tonight That I Might See
Capitol

50 Tonight That] Might See is
the perfect album to listen to on
a Sunday morning. The songs,
each built around one to three
strummed chords, never stray
beyond midtempo.

And Hope Sandoval’s gentle
voice gives the impression that
she too just woke up. The
album also provides the appro-
priate soundtrack for lovemak-
ing.

However, if you’re not look-
ing for pretty simplicity, Mazzy
Star’s second album can come
off sounding one—dimensional.

The band’s history goes back
to the late ‘80s and the band
Opal, which Mazzy guitarist
David Roback formed with
vocalist Kendra Smith.

The band played swirling
psych riffs and pinned them
down with drones from Ms.
Smith’s voice, a viola or an
organ, topped off by wah guitar
solos from Roback.

Throughout two albums, one _

posthumous, Opal bordered on
excessive, but hypnotized
enough to make it worthwhile.

After Smith left the band,
Roback teamed up with
Sandoval, a waif-like woman
with a voice resembling a more
sexual version of a ‘60s girl
singer.

Although the band was basi-
cally Opal with a new singer,
they rechristened themselves
Mazzy Star.

Their 1990 debut She Hangs

Brightly, carried on the Opal
tradition adding a slight country
music feel in the process.

So Tonight That I Might See
sounds virtually identical to the
last album. Sandoval sings calm-
ly, never getting too emphatic
or blase. Roback’s slide guitar
on songs like “Blue Light” keeps
the country-ish twang going.
The drumming in several songs
consists of simple snare drum
cracks punctuated by a tam-
bourine. It’s simple, yet it adds
to the music’s ethereal effect,
drawing more attention to
Sandoval.

The only thing missing is vari-
ety between _the songs. The last
album featured a few fast tunes.
On So Tonight, each song fol-
lows the same formula. It con-
tains a simple riff, usually
strumined on acoustic guitar,
played without changes, with
textures added over the top of
it.

Even their cover of the ‘60s
pop-psych group Love’s “Five
String Serenade” fits in with the
format.

Not that this fomiula is bad, in
and of itself. Galaxy 500 made a
career out of it. But while they
wrote repetitive songs, Mazzy
Star’s songs often sound like
half—finished ideas -—— riffs with-
out hooks — than songs. And
for some reason Roback, as pro-
ducer, relegates his guitar solos
to the background on songs like
“Mary of Silence” where they
need to be felt as much as
heard.

Only on the album’s finale,
the seven minute title cut, do
the guitars envelope and over-
power the rest of the sound.
Sandoval’s lyrics, spoken this
time, require a close listen. The
relentless one—chord melody
and heartbeat drumming
achieve the total trance effect
the band strived for throughout
the album.

Out of Order

by Thomas E. Patterson
Alfred A. Knopf
Hardcover $23.00

It’s getting harder and hard-
er to be a journalist in
America. I am just a graduate
student, and thank goodness.
If I was seeking employment
as a full-time journalist, I
would have to think twice.
Although you never know
with me, I enjoy martyrdom.

I feel sorry for print and,
especially, broadcast journal-
ists. Broadcasters share the
television with Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, the X-
Men and Batman — the latest
excuses for violence in
America’s city streets and in
the living rooms of suburban
America. Television is a
favorite place for parents and
politicians to assign blame for
every problem imaginable.

For Thomas E. Patterson, a
professor of political science
at the Maxwell School of
Citizenship and Public Affairs
at Syracuse University, print
and broadcast journalists play
an important role in subvert-
ing the Presidential electoral
process. In Out of Order:
How the decline of the politi-
cal parties and the growing
power of the news media
ztndennine the American way
of electing presidents,
Professor Patterson warns that
the American Way is threat-
ened by a lack of confidence

in our constitutional democra-
cy. Also jeopardizing baseball,
apple pie and Chevrolet is a
cynicism biting into the hearts
of the United States citizenry
and even graduate students at
the University of Pittsburgh.

Put simply, American
media, for a variety of reasons
one discovers early on in Out
of Order, offer negative cover-
age, in fact lots of negative,
hostile coverage during presi-
dential campaigns. He con-
vincingly cites study after
study documenting negative
press coverage showered on
George Bush, Bill Clinton and
Ross Perot. No matter how
often Bush scorned the
media during the 1992 cam-
paign, Clinton and Perot were
no media darlings during the
long haul.

Professor Patterson offers a
“damned if you do, damned if
you don’t” theory describing
newsroom reporting.
Journalists, long accused of
collusion with politicians, are
now constantly looking for
the story behind the story.
This occurs even when there
is no story behind the story.
Jaded journalists turn up the
heat when they find some

wrong-doing — or should I _

say, alleged wrong-doing —

that is trumpeted by political ‘

opponents.

Philandering charges haunt-
ed Clinton during the cam-
paign and continue to give
the White House the heebie-

year of his term.

were not skeptical, then they
would be accused of turning a

just bad news undermining

journalism problematic in a

According to Patterson, the
result can be the rise of presi-
dencies. For example, when
Jimmy Carter won the New
Hampshire primary in 1976,
news organizations declared
him a serious contender, even
though the real players decid-
ed to sit out New Hampshire.
Political party advocates and

jeebies. The President railed
Rolling Stone reporters for
always highlighting his bro-
ken promises and ignoring
the ones that he fulﬁlled.
Clinton does have a point.
Although he wimped out
on the civil rights of gays, les-
bians and bisexuals, he did
promise to tax the wealthy,
pass NAFTA, put a universal
health-care program on the
table, defend abortion rights,
support job service and put
forward competent, moderate
Supreme Court justices. Not
bad for a president in the first

Of course, if journalists

blind eye to graft and corrup-
tion. But bad news sells, and
this is what Patterson forceful-
ly demonstrates. But it is not

elections for Patterson. News
“analyses,” front-page cover-
age and hype make modern

democracy.

News, no matter how truth-
ful or important, is magnified.

we could laugh about it. MC
Jason Noble, of Rodan, also
announced the Swirlies’ van
crashed into a river and Seana,
the guitarist/vocalist, had to be
given mouth-to—mouth recitation
and was on heavy medication,
“So she might slug you.” A nice
lie before their set.

The Swirlies’ Fender instru-
ments paid homage to the con-
tinuing existence of shoe—gazing

Valentine blink a tear. Archers
of Loaf continued covering the
stage with a smell of feedback.
As Superchunk’s presence
pushed the crowd forward,
many fans endured other acts

Sunday was on the lines of

new songs and a cover of anoth-

“Waters Edge." By far they had
the largest crowd as the opening
act. A special Bricks reunion fol-
lowed. “A band this great
doesn't just start  mid-semes-
ter hobby and end,” was the atti-
tude of Sean Murphy from
Princeton’s '\X/PRB. Versus and
Rodan were other personal and
crowd favorites, both playing
loud with frenzied guitars. Small
Factory played the last set and
answered the heckling outburst
of Velocity Girl's Jim to play
that song with musical chords
“G-D-C.” They were probably
one of the most talkative bands I
had ever seen and wittiest. A fan
challenged the set list and yelled
for “Scared of Love,” and Alec
replied, “Me too!”

I realized this was the best $24

gave me access to creative
ideas, new bands, good coffee

quer music with the “Do It

Jerry McCullough scores 20 and Ahmad Sh

By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

The game was just
halfway over —- last night’s
Big East battle between Pitt
and Miami, that is -— when
Jerry McCullough, the
Panthers’ wondrous point
guard. noticed something.

Surrender of the opposi-
tion.

The big white flag.
~ Game, set and match.

“They had a look on their
face like “Here we go
again,” McCullough said of
the Hurricanes’ reaction to a
44-22 halftime deficit. “The
first half, we crushed their
confidence.”

McCullough, a man of few
words, orchestrated quite a
boastful performance by the
Pitt basketball team last
night, directing the “Ready
for Primetime” Panthers to a
83-55 whitewash victory
over Miami of Florida before
6,382 at the Field House and
an ESPN national television
audience.

McCullough, who drib-
bled, dished, and drained
his way to a near-perfect
night in the box score (20
points on five-of-five three-
point shooting, nine assists,
and just one turnover), led the
Panthers on a 17-0 run midway
through the first half that turned
a high-paced-but-slim 18-16 Pitt
advantage into a comfortable
35-16 lead —— one they would
never relinquish the rest of the
night.

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Jerry McCullough proved it again last night in
Pitt’s 83-55 route of Miami at Fitzgerald Field
House —— a 5-foot 11-inch (if that) point guard

can take over a basketball game.

“Tonight, he was about as good as you can
get,” Miami head coach Leonard Hamilton said.
“Did he miss a shot’ I wish he’d transfer.”

Pick a run by Pitt, and “Ice” was in the middle

of it.

The 17-0 run that put the Panthers in com-
mand of the game —— McCullough scored or set
up eight points in a row. He drove for a bucket,
drew a foul and hit the shot. He set up a Garrick
Thomas— basket on the break. He fired in a
three, then found Thomas for another score.

“It is all relative to how much a guy will con-
tribute to his particular team,” Hamilton said. “I
think he is contrib1.1ting to his team as well as
anybody in the league because he does the

things that make the team go.”

McCullough approached perfection in the
first half. He hit four of four from the field, all
three of his three—point shots and all three of his
free throws. He dished out four assists and
grabbed one steal. He did have one turnover

(so he’s human).

When Pitt stretched its lead into the thirties
midway through the second half, McCullough was in
the middle of it again. He set up center Eric Mobley
inside, and when Mobley’s shot was blocked, Ice was

With the win, Pitt improved to
8-3 overall, 3-1 in Big East play.
Miami, who has never won a
conference road game since
entering the league three years
ago, falls to 7-5 overall, 0-4 in
the Big East.

McCullough extended the Pitt lead to 34 points
with another trey at the 11:40 mark. He left the
, game at that point with 20 of the team’s 67
 points, nine assists and only one missed shot.
 McCullough said he couldnot remember the
last time he was “feeling it” on his outside-
shooting like he did last night.

“My role is not to score any more,” McCullough

“It is to pass to my teammates. That’s my first
option —- to get everybody the ball.”
, Pitt head coach Paul Evans said that the way

McCullough ran the Pitt offense was one of the
keys in the Panther victory.

“Jeiry’s floor game was as good as I've seen it,”

“The thing that is most impressive about Jerry
is that he makes great decisions. Tonight he
- made great decisions consistently,” Hamilton 8

“Any time you have a guy that is capable of
shooting that well from the perimeter —— and he
does not mind distributing the ball and looking
for his teammates —- you keep the ball in his
hands. If a guy is going to keep finding easy
baskets for his team, that's a tremendous asset."

McCullough said he had an easier time than
usual getting his teammates going in the game.

Surprise, surprise. Bill
Cowher fired special teams
coach John Guy yesterday.
Everyone and their mother
knew it was going to happen.
The Steelers’ special teams
were pathetic this year, and
that’s putting it mildly. Three
punt returns and one kickoff
return went for touchdowns,
and the blocked punt in the
waning moments of Saturday’s
playoff game against the
Kansas City Cheifs led to the
tying touchdown. The blocked
punt never should have hap-
pened.

Guy should have been given
his walking papers after the
Eric Metcalf show in
Cleveland, when Metcalf ran
back two punts on the Steelers.
Cowher waited a little too
long.

You can be sure that John
Guy will be on the mind of a
lot of Steeler players’ and fans’
minds in the offseason.

it to the big show, he’ll skip

-Let’s keep on the Pittsburgh
sports kick and talk about the
Pirates. Right fielder Orlando
Merced recently agreed to a
one—year’ contract worth
$1,475,000. The figure is
quadruple the $325,000 he
made last year.

Is Merced worth the money?
If you jog your memory the
Pirates shopped Orlando last
season and this winter in
search of a pitcher and didnt
stir up much interest. In
defense of Merced, he had a
career season, but only hit
eight homers and drove in 70
runs.

When an average player
makes $1.5 million a year, you
know that the sport has gone
to hell. Major League Baseball
salaries are out of control, and
there seems to be no stop to
the bleeding.

-Back to the Pens for a sec-
ond — rumor has is that Marty
McSorley is trade bait.

These rumors have quieted
recently because Mcsorley has
played a little better, putting
some points on the board in
the last few weeks.

An interesting scenario had
him returning to Los Angeles
where King head coach Barry
Melrose is searching for a big,
tough defenseman. Pittsburgh
would receive Tomas
Sandstrom in return.
Considering that no one knows
when Lemieux will be back, it
doesn’t seem like a bad idea.
The Pens could use the offense

that Sandstrom would bring

with him.

But it won’t happen ——
Penguin management will not
admit that McSorley was an
overpriced mistake until the
season is over.

By then, when they are
home watching the second
round of the playoffs, it will be
too late.

Swimmers travel to Cleveland

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s swimming
and diving teams came home from their
winter training trip in sunny Clearwater,
Fla. to a blizzard. But they’re hoping
Saturday’s meet at Cleveland St. will heat
them back up. ’

And for the men’s team (5-1) Saturday
couldn’t come soon enough. Since the end
of last semester the team has had to deal
with adversity that wasn’t there the first
half of the season. Three days after they
got home from Florida, the undefeated
and nationally-ranked Panther men went
to Penn St. and lost 123.5 to 1195.

“It was very disappointing,” head coach
Chuck Knoles said. “\X/_'e were stung for
about a day, but we just had to pick it up
and keep on going.”

And they’ll be going without Aaron
Fortner. Fortner quit school after last
semester to focus on training for the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta. He excelled in the
200—yard butterﬂy, and he swam the but-
terﬂy leg on Pitt’s premiere medley-relay
team.

But Knoles said his team is deep enough
to overcome the loss of Fortner, and that
as far as he’s concerned it’s a “moot issue.”

‘‘We’ve got five guys within a half sec-
ond of Fo1tner’s time,” he said.

Knoles said that freshman Joshua
Heynes could step up and fill the spot left
by Fo1tner’s departure.

And it appears that the Cleveland St.
meet may also be a moot issue for the
Panthers compared to what’s ahead.

“It’s going to be an easy meet for us,”
K3r'=i'oles said.

It’s an easy meet that precedes two of

the toughest meets of the year for the No.
22—ranked men’s team, at home against
defending Big East champion Villanova
(the team who ended the Pitt men’s string
of ten consecutive conference champi-
onships) and at Ohio St.

In contrast to Knoles’ expectation for
Saturday, the Pitt women are being a bit
more cautious.

“From the little results live seen, they
have some solid swimmers,” said head
coach Marian Cassidy. “They just got back
from their training trip so they’re on a
similar training phase to us. They’re
where we are now.”

The Pitt women (3-2) are now at their
strongest point of the season so far.
Cassidy said the Florida trip was their
most intensive training session of the
year, and that, while the team is tired,
they have come a long way in learning
how to swim fast while they are tired.

“They believe in themselves even more
so after the trip,” Cassidy said.

The Cleveland St. meet is the first of five
meets in the next four weeks for the
Panthers. And while a winning dual—meet
record is a goal for this team, make no
mistake that their number—one goal is’ a
no—brainer: the Big East Championships in
February. '

And the women can begin tuning up
for the Big East Championships on
Saturday because, according to Cassidy,
the Cleveland St. pool is a fast one.

“\X/e’re definitely going to go for some
season—best times,” Cassidy said.

And since a swimmer’s best times are
submitted for seeding in the Big East
Championships, this is definitely a meet
the women’s team is looking to take
advantage of.

With half of the season gone and heading into
crunch time, the Pitt Hockey Club is ready to
step off the nonstop roller coaster ride that
they’ve been on all year long.

Carrying the extra weight of a 2-3 divisional
record into the second half of the WPCHA sea-
son, the Panthers are looking to scrap their
sometimes erratic play and make a run at the
postseason.

Looking backgon the first half of the 1993-94
season, one might question how such a power-
ful team, both offensively and defensively,
could possibly find themselves scrambling for a
playoff berth. Their impressive 7-3 record
includes victories of 14-0 over California (Pa.),
12-2 over Lock Haven, and a 12-5 drubbing of
Penn State-Main. ~

But the three scores that head coach Harold
Ochs and the Panthers have been mulling over
during the month-long hiatus are those of 7-4,
5-2 and, particularly, 9-7.

Those were the scores by which Pitt received
their only three defeats of the season, all of
which came against divisional opponents. They
are also scores that could have — and in one
case should have ~— gone the other way.

The schedule makers dealt Pitt a tough hand
at the beginning of the year, with the Panthers
opening the WPCHA season against the league’s
top two teams — West Virginia and Carnegie
Mellon. The rowdy Mountaineer crowd con-
tributed to the Panthers’ opening loss to WVU. Against
CMU, the Panthers were fatigued after playing back—to-
back games.

On Nov. 21 against Penn State-West, however, Pitt
watched two separate leads slip away because of poor
discipline. Senseless, untimely penalties kept the
Panthers shorthanded for much of the third period and
allowed the Saints to climb back and win the game 9-7
on the strength of five power play goals.

Pitt News File Photo
The Pitt Hockey Club is 7-3, 2-3 in the WPCHA.

The complete disciplinary breakdown on the part of
the Panthers prompted a verbal lashing by Ochs, which
was apparently just what the team needed. In two
games since then, the Panthers defeated Lock Haven,
12-2, and Indiana (Pa.), 8-4. Pitt’s victory over the
Indians (1-4 in division one) broke a fourth-place tie
between the two clubs, and gave the Panthers the
inside track on the fourth and final playoff berth.

   

THE PI'ITNEVVS,Thursday,  13, 1994

Pitt hockey hopes to scrp errtic play for playoff run

The Panther’s next divisional matchup will

be on Jan. 22, when they will have a chance to
, redeem themselves against Penn State—\West.
; This important game will be a prelude to Feb.
5-19, when the Panthers will play four consec-
utive divisional‘ games against CMU, WVU,
Indiana, (Pa) and Slippery Rock to close out
the WPCHA season.
 To ensure themselves of a playoff berth, the
H’  Panthers should probably win at least three of
these five remaining divisional games. This
will be no small task, seeing as how Pitt man-
aged a 1-8-1 record against these clubs last
season.

But, if there was ever a team that could
break this jinx, the firepower of the ‘93-94 club
is more than capable of doing just that.

The Panthers are currently ‘second in the
WPCHA in scoring with 29 goals in five league
games. Their 79 goals in 10 games overall is
good for an astounding 7.9 goals/game aver-
age.

In the meantime, the Panthers are sure to
have their hands full this Saturday when the
travel to State College to face Penn State-Main
for the second time this year.

On Nov. 13, the Panthers, led by centers Bill
Elliott and Vic Disanti, embarrassed the Lions
at Golden Mile by the final score of 12-5. The
setting in Happy Valley should, however, give
the Lions an intangible edge.

The Panthers will be lead by captain
Disanti and SuperRook Elliott, who have been
among the league leaders in point scoring
most of the year. Elliott leads the Panthers with 34
points (19 goals, 15 assists), seven ahead of Disanti (10
goals, 17 assists). Elliott had a career night against Penn
St. on Nov. 13 with three goals and three assists. Disanti
added a goal and three more assists.

Other Panthers who should figure in against the Lions
this time around are speedy defenseman Tony Troyato
and power forward Matt White. Each had season highs
in scoring against the Lions.

Mobley himself struggled
offensively against the halfcourt
Miami zone, scoring just four
points on two-of—seVen shoot-
ing. But his mere presence —
the threat of, as Clark Kellogg
would say, “the monster ﬂush”
—— allowed his teammate to rain
open jumpers from every which
end of Fitzgerald.

“One of the things [Miami] was
concerned about was stopping
Eric,” Evans said. “Eric and our
big guys did a great job getting
the ball out to guys who had
open shots.”

“Mobley is really stepping up
his game for us," Shareef said.
“Today, he did all the little

things — rebound, get the ball I

Not your textbook traditional
Pitt offense. Or the desired
defensive results for the down-
trodden victims.

“We were pretty happy with
our halfcourt-defense,” Miami
head coach Leonard Hamilton
said.

“Unfortunately, we didn’t give
ourselves enough opportunities
to keep them in a halfcourt
game.

“We’re just not as quick as Pitt.

We didn’t have the speed to
keep up.”

“I hope we can keep the
open-court game going,”
McCullough said. “That’s our
game — an up-and-down
game.”

Michael Gardner led Miami
with nine points (Yes, that’s
right. No one in double figures).
As a team, the Hurricanes shot a
dismal 32 percent from the floor.

“\Y/e need to take a long, long
look at what we’re trying to do
as a team,” a disheartened
Hamilton said.

‘‘\We’re far from being where
we want to be.

While Miami’s destiny for the
Big East basement seems more
and more inevitable, Pitt’s future
fate lies in its next game —
Seton Hall, victors against #17

Saturday at the Field House

involved. First, he found Eric
Mobley for an alley-oop slam,
the big centers first points of
the game. Then McCullough

found Orlando Antigua for 

another dunk. “Ice” followed
up with a driving dish to
Ahmad Shareef for a baseline
jump shot.

“He gets the ball to the guys I

in positions where they can
deliver,” Hamilton said. “That
is the mark of a good point
guard. He has a knack for get-
ting the guys the ball where
all they have to do is put it in
the basket.”

McCullough also had a
strong defensive game, doing
the little things. For example,
after he overplayed a pass,
putting Pitt at a defensive dis-
advantage, McCullough made
up for his mistake by jumping
into a passing lane and get-
ting a steal.

Conditioning is also a key
for McCullough, who rarely
comes out of the game when

the outcome of a game is in ,_
doubt. Few players can run ,

the offense, pressure the
opposing point guard all over
the floor, play just about

McCullough did.
