gage the best orchestra in this dis-
trict for the occasion," said Harold‘

‘" ‘tee following the meeting, “but due

noon. V . V '
‘ At the last week’s meeting it was
announced that only .300 tickets will

the. doctrine of native spinning and

also preached prohibition, and was
painstakingly careful to make _"non-'

.A glance at the opposition point of
view which the Ghandi‘ extremes and
occasional eccentricities partly cre-

original necessitate a brief, carry-back
to 1918. I believe it was then that Mr,
Montagu, the English Secretary of
State for India in the British Cabinet,
came to India, and in collaboration
with thethen Viceroy, Lord Chalme-
ford drew up a reform system of gov-
ernment. This made provision fora
responsible. Indian Parliament, and
the opportunity _'of more eﬂiciently
training Indians in the exercise of po-
litical authority through the expedient
of extending alarge measure of au-
tomony to’ the more developed prov-
inces——inaking of each sub-capital, so
-to speak, a- self-suﬂicient, fully
equipped plant in politicaleconomy
for the pleasure and proﬁt of Indian
Matriculants. The very phraseology
which described the concessions, how-
ever, was made "to carry the reserva-
tion and warningpthat the new ma-
chinery to be so set up- for ‘Indian
management, would be clearly under
the ﬁnal authority of the British pro-
vincial governors. Thisauthority, as
of yore, trailed down to them through
the usual intermediaries from ' the
high places in London. It was not
self-government, but it was distinctly.
an advance over the earlier system
of capricious autocracy. -On there-
ception to be given the new scheme,
Indian opinion,’ split. Ghandi, his—non-
co-operationists,C the Mohammedan ob-
jectors to British policy in Turkey,
and the inevitable rabble of chronic
nialcontents, refused to recognize its
force when the inauguration of the
new, Parliament in 1921 (February 9)
gave it form, and found place for it
in the already swollen budget of prin-
ciples and institutions
credo obligated them to ignore.
I Elected Parliament ‘
. A respectable body‘ of Indian edu-
cated opinion, on theother hand, gave
their inﬂuence to the proposition that
the proper road to the coveted Domin-
ion status i. e., an equal rights mem-
ber . of the British‘ Empire, was
through conscientious adoption and
support of the Reforms.‘ When elec-
tions for the. ﬁrst Parliament were
held they went out and voted-and
elected ‘a Parliament_.- Considering
that the Ghandi faction adhered to
their‘ -non-co-operative po1icyC and
neither, voted nor ran for office, the
election of a Conservative Parliament
was of course inevitable. They con-
vened, received the -King and. Emper-
or's message of trust and good _will,
and under the guidance of Crown rep-
resentatives set jauntily forth on the
path and by-paths ofvlegislative gov-
ernment. As in thecase of the’non-

the case with any Indian group, there

questionably sincere,VworkVing in the-
way they thought best for the diadem

f- political "sovereignty 'with which

ey and their ancestors before them
had vainly sought to adorn their coun-
tryfs brow. Others were more mate-
rially minded; theirwealth and such
social place as they enjoyed made

 their usual attitude on all such issues
‘ one of complaisance with whatever

was the English view; besides, they
distrusted ‘the rough enthusiasm of
the irreconcileables; the lack of sym-
pathy" of this. class is quite under-
standable. Then too, to many of them
there is nothing quite so exquisitely
desirable as an English title. A num-

‘. ber of Indians have already been so

honored; those «still in the aspirant
‘class can be counted on to do nothing

 that might jeopardize‘ their prospects.
'There‘ were also members with rad-

and on whom ‘thelure of oﬂice acted

Much Ignorance and Superstition.

I have taken.\too much time over
current and impending issues. ,The
impression that strikes and bewilders
the innocent onlooker‘ is how they
would govern themselves if they got
the chance. If the machinery of gov-
ernment. ‘with all the blessed power
and responsibility and titles and rib-‘
bons and congressional travel ex-

penses that go with it‘, were turned

over. to them, what would -they do
with it? As a.‘319,000,000 entity, they

are amazingly ignorant and supersti-

tious. I haven’t got a, year book of
facts and ﬁgures here, but I think the
literates are somewhere around 5 per
cent. And what may have been the
test of that literacy had ‘cut of de-
cency to Culture’s-fair name best not
be exposed. Languages are as plen-
tiful as ducks in a mill pond.‘ Every‘
district has its own. I think the total

that is the thing that terriﬁes. There
are agreat number of religions rep-
resented, but it is -not in-thenumber
that the dangerlies. The great mass
of; the. population is either Hindu or
Mohammedan, in the proportion of
about 5 to 1, and the two sects hate
each other with a bitterness and un-
regeneracy that makes absolutely ap-
palling the outlook for -any. govern-
ment not resting on a. power‘ superior
to botl1.'.~I want tomention here "a

creed was fairly orthodox and[_he 1ived

alted. But with the ?l\'Ioliammeda.ns
this imetaphysical_ fog in which he
moved availed nothing; rather, being
of antipathetic -inspiration, it‘ antago-
nized. fGhandi therefore skillfully
took advantage of a rare opportunity,
which he-found ready to hand in the

plight of Turkey after the -Treaty oi’

Sevres. - _

’ Ghandi Wins Point.

As I remember, it was pretty gen-
eral " ‘news, that Mohammedans
throughout the world were incensed

They universally demanded the res-
toration, of Turkey to her full pre-
war status, and sointense and appre-
hensive -was-the uneasiness stirred
up that‘. England was obliged; to modi-
.fy- her orig'inal_.punitiVve ideastoward
the Khilafat as expressed in‘ the
Treaty of Sevres. Mr, Ghandi struck
a most effective pose in this crisis,
deftly, suggesting that if the British
Government: remained deaf to the rep-

resentations of those»*India.’n Moslems

who: desired the restoration of the Ot-

toman Empire to its political and re-

ligious status, it might be necessary
‘for all Indians, whether. Hindus or
Mohammedans to sever their connec-
tion with a power so deaftothe claim
of things spiritual. He won his point.
The Moslem leaders, the Ali Brothers,
became his allies and lieutenants, and
although the task of preserving that
unity in the face of -the -countless ugly

of sects rather. than ‘a, ‘nation, was
II10S‘t trying one, he -did succeedto a
wonderfulextent. I_ do not mean to
question-Mr. G_ha.'ndi’s sincerity. That
is not often done evenby his enemies.

INTERFRATERNITY TRACK AND BASKET BA_l-__|- , _

The interfrafternity’ basket ball». league and the. interfratermty track 00"‘
tests startfthis week and, needlessto say, both deserve the _heaI't|¢8t _8UPP°l't
of every Pitt fraternity. They mean a lot‘, not only in,stIrring;up_§plrl_t alld
enthusi,asm- within:eachafraternityr and pr°‘m°tins“clean,, who|esom_e rwglry
among thcfraternities, but in the possibility that any Wh0 haV°_ ““d'9°°"°"°d
.turned to greater future successeslfor;
their Alma Mater, might be found. The fullest support-of all the fraternities
is asked not only for the frat_ern'ity_’s own sake, for-the sake of lntcrfraternity
fellowshlp,_ but for the school's sake, and although some fraternity qrrla)’ thlllk‘
itself. woefully weak in track or basket ball, it owe_s.,it to _It_s_elf,__to the |nter-. .
fraternity Conference, and to the school to compe_te.not only in tliebasketh
ball league, but in every. track event of. the series, smd_zfaIlui_'es‘to do so
will be an outward sign to the whole school “of that_ fratermty’s-weakness-__ _

The basket ball league starts one’ week from tomorrow night-and the
first fraternity track event, the shot put, will be held at the indoor Track
