Graduate School
To:0ﬁer Master
in Letters Degree

Graduate Must Complete 30’Units
Of Graduate Ranldng With 2.0
Average To Be Eligible

Beginning next semester, the Uni-
versity will offer a new degree in its
Graduate School, that of Master in
Letters. This announcement has
been made by Dr. William J". Root,
dean of the School.

This degree is unique both in des-
ignation and in purpose among the
educational institutions in this coun-
try and has been added to the Univer-
sity curricular program to meet the
speciﬁc needs of the graduate student,
particularly those in the ﬁeld of teach-
ing. ‘While the Graduate School still
offers four other advanced degrees.
namely, Master of Arts, Master of
Education, Doctor of Philosophy, and
Doctor of Education, the newly added
degree is designed as a distinct serv-
ice to school teachers, social workers,
business men, and other college grad-
uates who need specialized training in
their chosen ﬁelds.

“The aim on the part of the Univer-
sity and its Graduate School is to of-
fer a more ﬂexible program of study
in the ﬁeld of adult education,” states
Dr. Root. “This master’s degree will
meet a long-felt need, particularly on
the part of high school teachers, to
increase their training and efficiency
and is also intended for other college
graduates who wish to enrich their
general culture and knowledge. This
progressive step, we feel, creates a
real opportunity for the individual
and will prove to be a salient contri-
bution to the cause of education.”

Any college graduate fulﬁlling the
requirements for admission to the
Graduate School is eligible for this
degree upon the completion of 30
credits of graduate ranking with a
scholastic average of 2.0. Those can-
didates who have already enrolled in
the Graduate School, are eligible to
transfer for the degree of Master in
Letters provided they have earned 16
or more credits in departments of the
University other than the ﬁeld of
education. The graduate curricula
committee is also accepting six credits
of advanced standing from other ac-
credited colleges and universities to
be credited toward this degree. As
in the case of the degree of Master of
Education, no thesis is required nor
any written or oral examinations in
the ﬁeld of education except those di-
rectly related to regular course work.

Candidates for any degree in the
Graduate School will be advised in
the selection of a program of study
by the graduate curricula committee.
Further information may be secured
by addressing the Graduate School of-
ﬁce.

In Univ e rs ity Receives

High Award Saturday.

By Milton G. Lehman, Jr.

Dr. Whitford H. Shelton, professor
of modern languages at the University,
was awarded the medal of the Legion
d’Honneur by the French government
on Saturday evening. This high
honor is equivalent to the award of
knightship under the British govern-
ment and was bestowed upon Dr.
Shelton at the monthly meeting of the
Alliance Francaise at the Board of
Education Administration Building on
Belleﬁeld Avenue.

The medal bears the national crest
and colors of France and was origi-
nated by Napoleon I as a mark of
distinguished service. The award
was presented to Dr. Shelton by
Louis Celestin, minister of national
education in Washington, D. C.

In recognition of his service in the
American Red Cross, as delegate in
the Bureau of Refugees in the World
War, on behalf of the French refugees,
and as a tribute to him for his contri-
bution as an outstanding teacher of
the French language and literature,
the honor has been conferred.

Dr. Shelton came to the University
as an instructor in French in 1912-,
in which capacity he remained for
four years. In 1916 he was made as-
sistant professor of romance lan-
guages. Near the conclusion of the
W’orld VVar he went to France on

turned to the University and received
the title of professor of modern lan-
guages, including the departments of
Freucli, German, Spanish and Italian.

Dr. Clausen Addresses Chi Rho Nu
On Medical-Ministerial Disharmony

 

“There has been a great gulf be-
tween the doctor and the minister.”
This was the opinion of Dr. Bernard
C. Clausen, pastor of the First Bap-
tist Church of Pittsburgh, who ad-

dressed the Chi Rho Nu, honorary
pre-medical fraternity, last Wednesday
at the Y Hut.

“The disharmony between the two
has been caused, I feel, by the super-
cilious attitude that doctors are in-
clined to take towards religion as a
thing of unreal or constrained facts.
The minister sends some of his ailing
patients to the doctor, but I wonder
how many doctors, whose patients are
suffering from the tightness and ten-
sion caused by the hurry and bustle
of modern living will advise a trip to
the minister.”

“Ask any doctor what his biggest
bugaboo is in ﬁghting disease, and he
will say it is caused by those patients
who are in agony, but refuse to give
any outward sign of their pain,” con-
tinued Dr. Clausen. “It is with these
people that the doctor should gear
in with the minister for, while the

doctor can accomplish miracles with
the human body, the minister is best
equipped to handle the problems of
the mind.”

Dr. Clausen remarked that some
people complained to their doctors
that they were carrying too heavy a
burden in this world, and that the doc-
tors agreed with the patients.

“I venture to say that I have never
seen more than half a dozen people
who were tired out because they
could not do one thing more,” he con-
tended. “But I have seen hundreds
of people who believed that they were
tired out, and who had not used up
all the energy that they were capable
of. ' The minister is able to show this
class of people that they have far
greater potentialities than they be-
lieve themselves capable of.”

At the close of Dr. Clausen’s ad-
dress, the president of Chi Rho Nu,
Robert Churchill, C37, announced that
next Wednesday's speaker would be
Dr. Samuel H. Williams, professor of
zoology. The meeting will be held
during the ﬁfth hour in Room 1 of the
Y Hut. All students will be welcome.

Perhaps the most important ma‘:-
ter to be brought before the meeting
of the faculty of the College tomor-
row afternoon at 3:3x£\ o’clock will be -
discussion and debate on proposed
division of the present School into
upper and lower units, it has been
learned.

The plan is in no definite form,
and details have not been worked
out, according to information re-
ceived by The News. But, accord-
ing to Dr. Stanton ‘C. Crawford,
such a plan will be presented in
quite rough form for the group’s
opinion.

Should such a plan be adopted in
the future, calling for separation of
the School in‘Jo a lower group for
freshmen and sophomores with a
majorifly of the courses offered of a
general, survey type, and an upper
group of more specialized courses,
it would follow current educationaal
trends, say observers.

It was stressed by Dr. Crawford,
upon being questioned, that the
meeting tomorrow will be concern-
ed almost entirely with expression
of opinion on the matter. ‘Whether
definite action for or against will
be »undertaken can not be deter-
mined.

The meeting takes place in Room

Luke Swank Tells AE-ME Seminar
Value Of Photography In Business

 

According to -Luke Swank, Univer-
sity photographer, in a talk to the
AE-ME seminar Thursday, the business
man should be able to use a type-
writer and a camera, Both, he said,
are essential for keeping records of
a business. However, being a. pho-
tographer, he parti2ula.r1y emphasized
the importance of the camera.

The camera which created the most
interest was a miniature one, so small
that it may be carried in the coat
pocket. Mr. Swank produced a “min-
nie” from his coat pocket and ex-
plained the vast possibilities of this
type because of the various lenses and
timing possible. Because of the re-
cent improvement in the emulsions
and ﬁlms for these cameras, they are
being used more widely by hobbyists

as well as the professional photograph-
er.

The camera which is most widely
used by the professional cameraman‘
is the Graﬂex. This camera is used
by all newspaper men for every type
of picture, and is used by others for
about 95 per cent of the pictures they
take.

Problems confronting the camera-
man, such as preventing lines from
converging or ﬁnding the correct focus
or lens, were explained to the group
by Mr. Swank.

An engineer’s qualiﬁcation for be-
coming a photographer were, accord-
ing to Mr. Swank, “His ability to lim-’
it a subject to one main item—a neces.
sary essential in the art of picture tak-
mg.”

In Fairness And In Faith

T IS NOT THE POLICY of The Pitt News to reply
through its editorial columns to persons who dis-

agree with its opinions. We feel justiﬁed, however, to
make an exception with regard to some charges made
by a downtown sports editor in his column Friday. Our
justification comes from the possibility that some stu-
dents may have missed the News editorial referred to
and formed an opinion only from the Comments of the
sports writer.

It isn’t necessary to give the gentleman’s name.
Those who read the comments will know it, and it is
only in making the case clear for them that we are in-
terested. In an item headed “No One’s Business,” the
fellow takes the News editorial writer to task for com-
ments upon the question of disposing of the city ‘foot-
ball trophy this year. In the short space of four column
inches. he calls the editorial writer a gentleman, TL Sir
Bourbon, a masculine Marie Antoinette, and a Greeley-
quite a range, to be sure——and arrives at the premise
that the News “asks, in effect, whose business is it but
Pitt's and Duquesne’s?”

VVe full well realize that the writer has been around
the game much longer than we have. But we fail to see
how he arrives at his question quoted above from the
theme of the editorial referred to, from which We quote:

“In plain language, the whole matter becomes sim-
ple enough. The inscription upon the cup donated
by the city decrees that ‘the cup is to be contested
for by the football teams of the University of Pitts-
burgh and the Carnegie Institute of Technology.’
Mr. Harrison (director of University athletics) has
asked the city council if it wishes to change that in-
scription to include Duquesne, and has also suggest-
ed that Carnegie Tech be consulted before the
change is made. ,

“Doubtless the council will, in the light of Du-
quesne’s rise to prominence, see fit to make that
change. Meanwhile, the University officials have
publicly recognized Duquesne as champion.”

The commentator carefully repeats in his column that
the “Pitt News writer does not reflect the attitude of
Pitt.” If the attitude of_ Pitt is of the high-handed type
that this columnist inte‘rprets’f1'om' our editorial, then
certainly we have not reflected the attitude of Pitt. In-
stead, we believe we have interpreted the attitude of
Pitt students as being deﬁnitely in favor of passing the
cup, through regular channels, to Duquesne in recogni-
tion of her football supremacy this year.

But we will never believe that students of the Univer-
sity approve of the implications in a downtown paper
that the school refused to surrender the cup. That story
was told, in the bulldog edition of the paper, in sen-
tences which called for a reader’s gasp at the end of
every phrase; succeeding issues toned it down. Nor
will we believe that it is the attitude of Pitt students not
to censure statements that University athletic authori-
ties had an eye for the box office at next fall's Pitt-
Duquesne game by attempting to start controversy over
the cup situation.

Breaking Tradition

For the ﬁrst time in 11 years a woman invaded the
sanctity of the varsity football dressing room at Minne-
sota University when Helen Randolph was permitted en-
trance by Coach Bernie Bierman to seek a color story
for the school paper this fall.

   

Put Up! The Firearms

“Any students residing in the dormitories who have
guns in their rooms are requested to call at the dean’s
office for the purpose of registering them,” says an ar-
ticle in the Colgate Maroon. Gangsters must get edu-
cated.

You’_l| Learn

VVl1en men students at Pennsylvania University circu-
lated a questionnaire seeking to ﬁnd out if the average
male prefers pretty girls or smart ones, they were
promptly squelched. Penn coeds retaliated with the
query, “Do you like intelligent men or typical college
men?”

Men Get A, Turn

An eastern women’s college compiled a report saying
that men become angry on an average of six times :1
week, but that women become angry only half that often.
A men’s coflege came right back with “True enough.
But who makes us 1nad?”

Puerile -Plans

A report from Berkeley, California, announces that
the University of California may abolish the fraterni-
ties unless “hell week” is made more strenuous.

Only Half the Truth

A woman's college is making a great deal of the fact
that statistics show that men get made on an average
of six times a week, and women only three.

Wait A Minute!

The student paper at Elizabethtown college at Eliza-
bethtown_ Pa., is running editorials on the advantages
and disadvantages of Saturday classes.

They claim that the students have a hectic week and
a dull, unoccupied week-end which would be much better
balanced if classes were held on Saturdays.

Collegians Can Take It
The mortality rate for the population—at-large is al-
most three times as high as for students of college age,
according to statistics compiled by the University of
Michigan Health service.
College Editors Speak
In a recent poll of college editors Franklin D. Roose-
velt won a huge majority as their choice for president
in 1936. The poll revealed that 480 editors favored
Roosevelt, 52 favored Borah, and 26 would like to se
Frank Knox hold down the job.

Mr. Brotzman Appears, Gives
Low Down On Local Climate

A headline on a Pitt News article
several weeks ago read, “Look out,
Mr. Brotzman, here come the Pitt
weathermen. Last week, the reverse
was true — “Look out Pitt weather-
men, here comes Mr, Brotzman." On_
that afternoon, Mr, Brotzman gave a
lecture illustrated with slides to about
50 University students.

Many of the working details of the
weather bureau were disclosed to the
group. While the word “bu1k” proba-
bly means nothing outside of its dic-
tionary meaning to most people, a
weather prophet can interpret it into
several things. When it is the first
word in a message, it means that the
barometer reading is 30.1 inches, and
the temperature is zero. When it is
the second word in a message, “bulk”
conveys the information that the wind
is northwest and the weather is clear.
This word is only one of a complicated
system that is used to telegraph the
conditions at various stations to other
stations.

Hail, which is formed by wind cur-
rents-carrying the rain upward into
layers of colder air, left gaping holes
in the roofs of a -line of Model T's dur.
ing a storm at Dallas, Texas. Other
hailstones ranging from 17 inches in
circumference to one inch in diame-
ter were shown on the screen and de-
scribed by Mr. Brotzman.

Students To Visit Westmoreland
Homesteads, Hill District

The Human Relations Committee of
the YM and YWCA, under the super-
vision of co-chairmen Alice Crutch-
ﬁeld, C36, and Forrest Alter, uE'd36, an-
nounces two trips for Christmas week,

The ﬁrst is a trip to the Westmore-
land I-Iomesteads, a. project of the
Federal Resettlement Administration,
a week from today, The second trip,
scheduled for the following Friday, is
a tour of the Hill District.

The Homesteads experiment in com-
munal living, formerly known as the
Subsistence \Homesteads, is similar to
the projects in VVest Virginia in
which Mrs. Roosevelt has shown much
interest. Visiting a cooperative store
will be one of the high-spots of this
trip. The group will leave from the
Y hut at 12:30 o’clock in the after-
noon, go by auto to the Homesteads,
seven miles out of Greensburg, and
return to the city by 5:30 o’clock.

Twenty Penn State students who
live in Pittsburgh will be the guests
of the committee on the Hill District
tour, which will include an inspection
of housing conditions, a guided tour
of the Irene Kaufman Settlement, a
visit to a cooperative grocery store,
and a talk by a member of the Urban
League. This group will meet in the
lobby of the Central Y on Chatham
Street at 9 o’clock in the morning
and will tour until the middle of the
afternoon.

Anyone interested in going on
either or both trips is asked to sign
up at the Y office in Heinz House or
in the Y hut before 5 o’clock, VVednes-
day afternoon. Those who can take
cars are asked to indicate so when
they sign.

Students Must Qualify Tomorrow
For Team To Meet Faculty

The last chance for student bridge
players to qualify for the student-fad
ulty match on January 9 will be pre-
sented tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
o’clock when the Pitt Bridge club
meets in Room 704, Cathedral.

This tournament is the third of a
series begun last year. Honors thus
far are even at one match apiece, but
the faculty team still carries the honpr
of winning by the greatest margin.
The students, however, won the last
match and are eager to continue their
winning streak.

Twenty players will comprise each
team, and will be divided into ten
pairs. A tentative student team will
be announced at the end of the Christ-
mas vacation.

iLeonard Seder, C37, and Frank
Hockensmith, E36, ﬁnished ﬁrst in
the duplicate game last Tuesday, with
Richard Callomon, C39, and Stanley
Markey, C39, in second place.

According to Seder, president of
the club, all student members must
be present at tomorrow's meeting in
order to have themselves considered
for membership of the student team.
'1 here is still plenty of room for a
“dark horse or two” to make the team,
Seder says.

‘Tentative plans are being made for
intercollegiate matches with Duquesne,
Carnegie Tech, and Pennsylvania Col-
lege for Women.

Lessenberry To Address
Kappa Phi Kappa Meeting

Undergraduate and graduate mem-
bers of Kappa Phi Kappa, honorary
education fraternity for men, will hear
D. D. Lessenberry, director of courses
in commercial education, at a dinner
meeting tomorrow evening at 6:15
o’clock.

Mr. Lessenberry will speak on “Edu-
cating for Better Business Practices.”

The regular monthly meeting of
Kappa Phi Kappa is planned to ac»-
quaint the members with some of the
leaders in the ﬁeld of education.

Dinner will be served at the Uni-
versity cafeteria at a charge of 50
cents.

Conclave Today

In preparation for the third annual
intercollegiate conference on govern-
ment, meeting in Harrisburg in April,
1936, all University students are in-
vited to attend a meeting at 3:30
o’clock today, in Room 202, Alumni
Hall.

At this preliminary plans will be laid
to insure a well organized, representa-
tive University delegation attending
the conference.

According to Miss Genevieve Blatt,
graduate assistant in political science
and director of the conference during
the past two years, the conference
will probably take on the form of
model political nominating conven-
tions, with selection of major party
candidates, and formulation of politic-
al platforms for the 1936 presidential
campaign.

Gathering from 35 colleges and uni-
versities of the entire state, the dele-
gates will be given an opportunity to
make a practical application of their

“book learning” of conduct of conven-
tions. ‘

Amateur Stops Show,
Armstrong Grabs Toe

To Bernie Armstrong, Pittsburgh
orchestra leader who officiated at
the Pitt Amateur night last Wed-
nesday evening at the Roosevelt
Hotel, the words of Shelton Green-
berg, C39, “Aw gee, Maw, I don't
see why I hafta take a bath every
night,” are more impressive than
that other great American quota-
tion, “Don’t shoot until you see the
whites of their eyes.”

Greenberg was giving a mono
logue, “The Bath,” dramatizing it
with all the force he could com-
mand. After the part quoted above
he raised his right foot high and
punctuated the sentence by stomp-
ing it down on Armstrong's toes.

The program stopped for ﬁve
minutes while Armstrong inspected
his bruised foot. Incidentally,
Greenberg did not get ﬁrst, second,
or third prize.

catch with lightning and ended up sec-
ond best as toothpicks scattered over
the immediate terrain were a source of
amusement for the future weather
men.

The question of producing artiﬁcial
rain was described by Mr. Brotzman
as being practically impossible. The
reason for this is the fact that to cov-
er a square mile with one inch of rain,
which amounts to a very small storm,
would require 72,320 tons of water.

Another fantastic scheme which was
suggested to Mr. Brotzman as a PWA
project was the idea of building a
wall along the southern coast of Flori-
da so high that the hurricane couldn’t’
get over it. Thus all the damage re-
sulting from the famous Florida hurri-
canes would be ended. All of which
would be a. very good thing Mr, Brotz-
man added, except the wall would
have to be over a mile high.

Another series of slides was devot-
ed to the causes and effects of cumu-
lus clouds. The effects were mainly
in connection with the ﬂight of an air-
plane over ‘these regions.

The most extreme temperature in
the country Mr. Brotzman said, are
130 degrees Fahrenheit in Death Valley
and 64 degrees below zero in some
sections of Montana. Pittsburgh wind

12.8.

USC Falls Before Avenging

Panthers In Season’s Finale

Randour Finally Makes
Way Across Goal;
Line Sparkles

With the Hub of the McDonald.
Pennsylvania, Randours wheeling of!
plenty of yards and making his ﬁrst
touchdown of the season, the Golden
Panthers of Pittsburgh dented the
walls of Troy on two occasions for
scores to give them a 12-7 victory over
Southern California in an intersec-
tional clash at Memorial Coliseum
Saturday. It -was Pitt’s ﬁrst triumph
on the Pacific coast since 1922 when
Stanford fell before the Panthers-

Forty thousand. fans. €!110YIDg the

 

balmy Southern California weather,-

watched Randour and his teammates
turn on the power in the first and
third quarters to pay back a couple of
Rose Bowl debts accumulated in 1930
and 1932. The victory also evened the
series between the schoolsat two-all.

-Shortly after the opening kickoff,
Frank Souchak got in front of a Tro-
jan ﬂat pass and raced 42 yards to the
USC 15-yard line where he l-..teraled
to Bomber Shaw who was downed on
the California 9-yard line. Shaw fum-
bled on the play, but Souchak was
again Johnny-on-the—spot to recover
for the Panthers, Randonr and Pat-
rick alternated in four tries at the
line with the fullback going over for
the first score of the afternoon. Pat-
rick, who did the punting for Pitt Sat.-
urday, missed the try for the extra
point.

In the third quarter, after an ex-
change of punts, the varsity found it-
self deep in its own territory and the
goal line just 81 yards away. Exactly
eight plays later the pigskin was
nestled in Randour’s arms across the
Trojan goal line. On this drive Rand-
our carried the bah three times for a
net gain of approximately 57 yards,
contributing two 25-yard sprints in the
series.

That was all the scoring the Panth-
ers did for the afternoon, but the
ﬁnal thrill for them was still to come.
Late in the fourth period, the sons of
Troy, aided by a couple of penalties,
landed on the Pitt 5—yard stripe. An-
other offside infraction set the ball
on the 1—yard line with still ﬁrst and
goal to go. In six smashes at the
Panther forward wall, two more off-
side decisions being rendered in be-
tween times, the Trojans advanced the
ball about a millimeter.

After Pa+rick’s kick from behind his
own goal line, one of the many aerial
attempts that the Trojans tried was
nabbed by Gaisford for a touchdown.
The game ended two plays later.

Randour, averaging about eight
yards every time he laid his hands on
the pigskin, and Detzel, Souchak,
Shaw, and Kliskey stood out for Pitt.
Gil Kuhn and Dave Davis played best
for Southern Cal.-—"i-I. E.‘PI..

Bob Madden To Play
In National Net Event

Bob Madden_ varsity tennis star,
will spend part of his Christmas va-
cation in New York, playing in the
annual National Junior Indoor tennis
championships. He will probably
leave Pittsburgh the latter part of
next week for Gotham.

This will be Bob’s third and last
trip to the junior indoor event, as he
will reach the junior age limit some-
time between now and next Cl1rist-
mas.

Incidentally, speaking of tennis, the
ﬁnals of the University tourney have
yet to be played, but eventually it is
hoped to complete the net event on
indoor rectangles. Madden is one of
the finalists, but there's a matter of
a couple of other matches to be played
before his opponent can be deter-
mined.

Panther Cagers
Face Butler Five
At Indianapolis

Coach Carlson's cage team swings
into the ﬁnal leg of its annual mid-
western trip this evening when-it
meets the Butler University ﬁve at
Indianapolis, Indiana. The squad was
scheduled to arrive in the Hoosier
City this morning after spending yes-
terday in Chicago.

Last year the Panther quintet
swamped the Butler boys under a 42-
22 deluge of baskets and fouls, and the
midwestern outﬁt will be after the
Panther’s skin this evening. Only Cap-
tain Roderick, Loucks, and Noon re-
main from the Pitt ﬁve which beat
Butler last season, but the sophomores
on the team will enable the Carlson-
ites to “keep sweet” even if the But-
ler boys are too strong.

Stop Iowa, 32422

The barnstorming cagers came out
even—steven in games with Iowa and
Northwestern universities. ‘Nith its
attack clicking consistently for the
first time this season, the Pitt outﬁt
subdued the Iowans Saturday night,
32-22.

Captain Ted Roderick and Rags
Radvansky each gathered nine points
as the Panthers swept through the
Hawkeye defenses with a. beautiful ex-
hibition of ballhandling in their fast-
l)reaking attack. Meanwhile, the Pitt
defense was holding John Barko, Iowa
Big Ten Conference scoring ace, to
one ﬁeld goal and one foul.

The Hawkeyes sported their great-
est advantage at 6-2 early in the ﬁrst
period. Miles Zeleznick and Radvan-
sky then put on a little rally, with a
foul shot by the former ﬁnally sending
the Panthers into the lead. -Roderick
dropped in two long ones from the
center of the ﬂoor to allow Dr, Carlson
to sit back and relax.

The Pitt boys did exceedingly well
at the foul line, missing on only one

out or 12 attempts. The lineup:

Lose to Northwestern

After matching the Purple cagers
of Northwestern University blow for
blow until shortly after the start of
the second half, the Panthers fell be-
fore a Vvildcat blow-off in the ﬁrst
game of their western trip, losing by
a count of 38-30. .

A see-saw ﬁrst half ended with the
boys from Evanston holding a. 16-14
advantage. Eddie Spotovich tied it
up when play was resumed and Billy
Jesko sent the Panthers two points
ahead a minute later, That was the
signal for the Northwestern guns, big-
gest of which were sophomores Jake
Nagode and Fred Trenkle, to boom,

Varsity Cridders Open
Banquet Season Next

 

With the football season just
about over for another eight
months, coaches, managers, and
players will make ready to settle
down to the strenuous banquet sea-
son which has already gotten un-
der way in most sections of the
country.

One of these affairs will be held
on January 9. Before the boys on
the Panther team took the ﬁeld last
Saturday afternoon,,a telegram was
read to the squad, extending an in-
vitation for them to be the guests
of the Pitt Varsity Letter Club. Al-
lcn K. Collingwood is president of
this organization.

The banquet will be given at the
University Club, and invitations to
over 600 University lettermen will
be sent out to former star athletic
performers after December 20.

Olson Speeds Up
Indoor Workouts

Olson Looks For Largest Number
Of Candidates In Pitt History

Indoor drills in the track house
gain momentum as the runners, jump-
ers, shot-putters, in fact the entire
squad excepting the javelin, discus,
and hammer specialists, enter the
second week of training for the indoor
season.

A heavy snow and saggy ﬁeld slow-
ed up the boys in the weight division
during the past week-end. However,
Charley Gongloff, assisting Coaches
Olson and Potts, aims to get his pro-
teges out as soon as the weather
clears up.

Approximately 10' late candidates
reported for equipment on Friday, and
Olson expects close to 25 more dur-
ing the ensuing week, This will bring
the number of performers up close to
the century mark to establish a record
number of participants in the spiked
shoe sport, only recently expanded
here at Pitt.

The Panther relay team is again ex-
pected to be one of the crack outﬁts
in the country. After several individ-
uals, including Pete Bowen, Frank
Shea, Everett Utterback and Bill
Keller established the Panthers on
track and ﬁeld, mile-relay teams
climbed into the spotlight during the
past ﬁve-year period. Two late Pitt
captains, Keller and Fred Kiger, 1935
leader, aided not a little in hanging up
high standards for the University in
this department.

Delts Add Another
Cup To Collection

Capture Greek Volleyball Crown,
Defeating Phi Delts In Finals

 

Once again emerging into the In-
terfraternity sportlight, Delta Tau
Delta netted another trophy by bat-
ting out a clean-cut 15-11, 15-7 victory
over Phi Delta Theta in the champion-
ship game of the Interfraternity vol-
leyball tournament, Thursday at Trees
Gymnasium.

Both teams were evenly matched,
and the ﬁrst game was a regular hair-
raiser. Lengthy volleys found the
lead see-sawing from one side of the
net to the other. Finally, with the
score knotted at 11-all, the Delts
surged out front, gaining a two-point
advantage before losing the serve.
From that point they were not to be
overtaken and quickly added the win-
ning margin on the next two serve

Falling on the short side of this
stubbornly-fought battle seemed to
sap the spirit out of the Phi Delts, and
in the next game the Delts swept to
a 15-8 triumph in a decisive manner
to cinch the title.

Al Duff and Nape Hepburn, the
heroes of the Interfraternity touch
football tourney, were co-starred
again. Spiking with effectiveness,
they were the big guns in the Delt at-
tack. Bill Housel also contributed a
pretty piece of net-play for the. vic-
tors while Alcroft, I-larvey, and Ryden
rounded out the supporting cast.

Upholding the losing cause were
Bill Grosscope and Jim Nicholas, who
turned in the outstanding perform-
ances for the Phi Delts. Bob Prince,
Bernie Cashdollar, Bob Dannies, and
Pete Vv'right comprised the runner-up
squad.

In its titleward match, Delta Tau
Delta brushed aside all opposition
with comparative ease, swamping Phi
Epsilon Pi, 15-4, 15-3, and shellacking
Pi Kappa Alpha, 15-8 and 15-8.

The Phi Delts eliminated Lambda
Chi Alpha in the ﬁrst round and
trounced Phi Gamma Delta to enter
the championship bracket.

Quota Bid Rules

Plan Limiting Number Of Pledges
Allowed For Each Fraternity
Referred To Committee

 

Advantages and disadvantages of
the quota system and preferen-
tial ballot were evaluated by
Panhellenic Council at a recent din-
ner meeting- An...open ‘discussion was
held following the report 011 the quota
system, given by a committee con-
sisting of Betty Kelley, C37, Jean
Lawson, C31‘, and Louise Kelly, C36.

A quota "system which would limit
the number of women a fraternity
may pledge,‘ and‘a preferred bid list,
composed" of two primary sections, is
the fundamental ‘plan. According to
the plan each fraternity should send
in a bid list, the first part of which
contains tile names of those women
whom the fraternity group prefers up
to the limit of their quota. The sec-
ond part of the list consists of the
names of other rushees in whom the
fraternity group is interested.

The preferential ballot of the same
type which 1's used by the Council at
present would be distributed to all
women whose names appear on either
list.

However, if certain rushees on the
fraternity’s first list select another
group or decide to remain non-frater-
pity, the second list comes into use.
Rushees are selected from the second
group in the order of the appearance
of the.r names on the list.

The purpose of the plan is to limit
the number of members belonging to
the fraternities in order to form a
more even ratio between large and
small groups.

Objections to the plan included the
fact that the entire number of fra-
ternity women on campus would be
decreased. Discrimination between
the rushees would make for friction
in the group when the ﬁnal votes are
taken.

It was decided that further investi-
gation by the committee would be ad-
visable. Margaret Chalmers, Ed36,
president of Panhellenic, suggested
that letters should be sent to various
universities where the quota system
is in operation.

Miss Chalmers also asked the rep-
resentatives to Council to check up
on the names of their fraternity mem-
bers and bring up to date the names
in the fraternity ﬁles in order to
facilitate the work of the publicity
committee which is compiling “O
Philos,” the Panhellenic handbook.

woman in the pre-coeducational year
of 18051 and wound up with the ﬁrst "In-
terclass Sing in 1930. '

Highlight episodes were the junior
imitation of nightgown-,clad freshmen
participating in the ﬁrst Lantern
Night in 1918, and Betty Knop’s por-
trait of a luckless freshman being
hazed in 1922.

Next the freshman class led by
Mosse Lyngheim, gave a slightly
nervous version of their representatimi
of a perfect interclass sing, ‘with four
bespectacled members of the _class
acting as judges while"pleas’were
made in turn for awarding the palm
to each of the four classes. Claiming
that “that’s why freshmen were
born.” the freshmen of course award-
ed themselves ﬁrst place in their
mock Sing contest. Freshmen were
also born, according to their song, be-
cause “someone had to have prostra-
tion o’er the trials of registration," and
“someone had to cheer in grand-
stands.”

A sophomore girl’s dream of the
ideal college man formed the theme
for the sophomore contribution to the
contest led by Juniata Steele. First
part of this composite man was Ruth

Win Class §'ing For Juniors

\Vith a_ series of skits p1‘_eSe11ti11g' the history of women at the
University, the junior class, led by Betty Bryson, sang its_way
to ﬁrst place and possession of the winner ‘s cup in the annual Inter-
class Sing contest Friday afternoon. '

First of ‘thefour classes to perform, the juniors started oﬁ their
program with a tuneful picture of

 

the life‘ of a fashionable young

Rosenthal, as Joe College, the typical
college man who. after parading about
with pipeand plaid coat, participated
in the paddling of a fraternity pledge
during “Hades Week.” Later, Mary
Kenngott, as the gridiron hero, gave
a realistic kick which landed her foot-
ball neatly on‘ a Heinz House ‘light.

Winding up the program came the
seniors’. with Ruth Sochatoff, as a
well-pillowed Santa, Claus, bouncing
on to the stage with a somewhat
small Christmas tree and Christmas
gifts for each of the classes.

The heart’s desire of a. freshman
woman was, according to the seniors,
a panther pin, whereupon Jane Little
appeared in panther skin waving a
tail of satisfying length. Fraternity
pins, dance programs, and sheepskin
scrolls were presented by Santa to
the sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

Following some ﬁnal impromptu
singing, the 13 cap-a11d-gown clad
judges announced their decision on
the contest, and women of the four
classes clambered down from their
sections of the improvised stadium
into which Heinz House had been
turned for the occasion.——R. H.
