HDK‘ Reveals

Committee
Selection

Omicron Delta Kappa, national
honorary leadership fraternity for
junior and senior men, has an-

. nounced the selection of this year’s

Senior Award committee. The

’ ODK award, given to the senior

male student who has attained, in
the eyes of the electing group, the
highest standard of leadership in
collegiate activities, will be pre-
sented by that organization on
spring Tap day, May 4.

,According to University tradi-

'tion, the name of the person se-
‘ cu-ring the award will be chiseled

in the ODK stone walk, leading
from the Belleﬁeld entrance of the

Cathedral to Heinz chapel. In ad-
dition, the awardee receives a
certiﬁcate of selection as holder of
the award.

The committee of selection,
chosen by its ex-ofﬁcio chairman,
the dean of men, is composed of
ﬁve members: the dean of men,
three male members of the fac-
ulty, and one recent alumnusof
Omicron Delta Kappa. This year’s
committee are: Chairman Theo-
dore W. Biddle, dean of men; Vin-
cent W. Lanfear, dean of the
School of Business Administra-
tion; Frank Bromilow, assistant
professor of civil engineering; Dr.
W. George Crouch, associate pro-
fessor. of English; and Robert

. Davis, now enrolled in Pitt Medi-

cal school, who is a recent alum-
nus and member of Omicron Delta
Kappa.

On election day, the committee
invites all senior members of
Omicron Delta Kappa, and at least
twice this number of other senior

, men students who merit consider-

ation for the award, to nominate
those whom they think most de-
serving 'of the award. From those
names which are submitted, the
committee of ﬁve makes its ﬁnal
selection of the person to be hon-
ored. .

The purpose of the award, as
stated in, the senior award code of
Omicron Delta Kappa, is twofold:

. ﬁrst, to recognize annually the

senior male student who has at-

«Stained a high standard of leader-

ship in collegiate activities, to en-
courage him to continue along this
line, and to inspire others to strive
for similar attainments; second, to
recognize that type of student

‘whom, in the opinion of the com-

mittee, the University should aim
to produce.

Eligibility for the senior award
requires of the senior male student
one continuous year of residence
at the University, graduation with-
inthe year in which the award is
made, and the maintenance of a

’general quality point average in

all subjects of 1.00 or above.

You Can Do Better
Than This!

C’mon kids, you can do better
than THIS! Now the “Pittscapades
of 1945” really isn’t bad, but the
“Icecatpades” thought of it ﬁrst.
We’ve got troubles of our own,
brother, without lawsuits.

So, here’s your big chance:
give with a name for the Pitt
Players’ spring show. We would
prefer something that can be
printed in the News. You know,
something that’s nice and innocu-
ous, something that doesn’t tread
on anybody’s toes. Well, no im-
portant toes, anyhow.

Should you have a brilliant idea,
stick it in the box down near the
bulletin board. If it’s cute and
catchy, we’ll use it. And you?——-
you get two great big tickets t-o
our sup»er—musical. Okay, here we
go; let’s pack -that ballot-box!

Miller Takes New Job

Miss Caroline Miller, formerly
employed by the registrar’s of-
ﬁce, has taken over the secretarial
position formerly held by Miss
Lois Rowbottom in the dean of
men’s office.

Pitt in 1944, where her major in-

Pittsburgh’;

‘on Thursday, April 5, at 8 o’clock

in the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Me-
morial Hall.

The Infantry Concert Group is
a regular army musical organiza-
tion, formed entirely of enlisted
men who played with our out-
standing symphony orchestras be-
fore their induction into the army.
Many of the group’s sixteen mem-

bers have seen active service. All
of them are well known as mem-
bers of major orchestras or as con-
cert soloists. Pfc. Richard Freitas,
conductor of the ensemble, was
head of the music department of
the Horace Mann School in New

York City and played the viola,

with the NBC Symphony.

Although a deﬁnite program for
tomorrow’s concert has not been
announced, it will consist of the
sort of light classical numbers
which should appeal especially to
students, including compositions
by such people as Gershwin,
Strauss, and David Rose.

The usual admission price for
non-service members to a concert
by the Infantry Concert group is
the purchase of a $25 war bond;
but Mrs. Heinz, who arranged to-
morrow’s performance, believes
that Pittsburgh students deserve
a treat for their enthusiastic sup-
port of War Finance Committee
programs.

Tickets for this -concert, there-
fore, will cost only one dollar’s
worth of war stamps—you keep
the stamps. Stamps and tickets
will «be sold at the ground floor
booth today and Thursday, at the
door Thursday evening, and in
the halls and »classes by the fol-
lowing members of the Pitt War
Finance committee, identiﬁable by
their red, white, and blue badges:
Jacqueline Goodman, Louise
Johnson, Sally Watkins, Shirley
Washington, Penn Burke, Jean
Mueller, Lee Mclnerny, Sidney
Klein, Helen Hodis, Elaine Brown,
Louise Caldwell, Peggy Stewart,
an-d Deirdre Baird.

Students are urged to kill two
birds with one stone: invite their
families and ‘friends, and ﬁll up
that neglected stampbook. “Col-
lect your friends from other
schools,” advises chairman Jackie
Goodman, “and make a party of
it. It’s going to be a big night for

4” colleges." " Q,

Next Monday, ﬁve men will meet to select, from a list of

{representative senior men students, the person to receive this

- year’s senior award. Into the hands of each has been placed

the senior award code, the rules by which Omicron Delta Kappa

governs the award. Perhaps the most signiﬁcant statement laid

. down in the code is Article II, which, by implication, charges

each of these ﬁve men with the seriousness and import of his
task. It is a statement of the purpose of the award.

“The purpose of the senior award shall be two-fold. First:
. to recognize annually, the senior male student whohas attained
a high standard of leadership in collegiate activities, to encour-
age’ him to continue along this line, and to inspire others to

strive for similar conspicuous attainments. Second: to recog-
nize that type of student," whom in the opinion of the committee,
the University should aim to produce.”
, In these words, the ODK Senior Award committee states
, those principles by which it confers the highest honor that can
"come to a Pitt senior man. It is that kind of statement which
should make each of us pause to reﬁect how genuinely and how
iconspicuously he has followed these principles, especially at a.
timewhen the bludgeonings of social upheaval and world war
have made it difﬁcult to focus our perspective upon what is truly
signiﬁcant in our life as part of Pitt.

We as students undertook two obligations to Pitt. when we
ﬁrst registered as beginning freshmen. One was to give to the
University that attitude of interest in scholarship and awareness
-of the world about us that makes a college the receiving and
nurturing ground for new ideas and new ways of life. The
second is to take from the University that training in leader-
ship and social bearing by which Pitt is honored to mark each
of us as one of her graduates’.

The makers of the code must have had this second obliga-

' tion in mind when they wrote down the purpose of the senior

award. Whatthey held signiﬁcant was the contribution of the
individual to Pi:tt’s campus life, a life upon which warhas
placed. new values and requirements. No longer are activities
a‘ means and end in themselves, a kind cif four—year entity
which breaks contact with students immediately upon gradu-
ation. Today Pitt students owe a promise to our thousands of
servicemen to keep intact and functioning the kind of campus
life they want to return to in peace. - . .

U’ The stage is now set for molding the patterns into which
post-war Pitt activities will ﬁt. The administration, far-sighted
in its planning, already is contemplating the addition of facili-
ties for student activities. A student union is a speciﬁc part of
post-war building; Chancellor Bowman has broached plans for
student dormitories and fraternity houses built in consideration

of the Cathedral as activities ﬂoors only awaits the war ’s end;
a,nd,Pitt’s publications, such as the Panther, are already sched-
uled for re-vitalization even before victory.

The students who today take interested leadership in Pitt’s
activities will be those to determine their future course. It is
the eﬁort of its members that determines how many tourna-
ments Men’s Debating will enter; it is the vigor of its speakers
that will or will not make Women ’s Speech an effective speak-
ing circle; it is the talent and imagination of its individual

spring musical will be; it. is the resourcefulness of the Pitt News
staff‘ that turns into print the weekly report of Pitt’s campus
life; it is the effort of each member of a fraternity-that will in
last analysis make for the working unity of the group.

. In these activities, or in any other, the war has made it
possible for freshmen and sophomores to rise quickly to posi-
tions of responsibility. The future of Pitt’s campus organiza-
tion has been entrusted to their judgment. It is they who must‘
make certain that when Pitt’s thousands of servicemen return
home, they may ﬁnd competently functioning campus life, into
the ﬂow of which, rather than into the building of which, they
can direct their interests.

Itis the responsibility of those of us in school today to
appreciate our opportunities. We have obligated ourselves to

You vets have given many rea-
sons why you do not want to
take an active interest in the Pitt
Veterans club. The excuses, legiti-
mate or not, have ranged from
“not,_enough time” to “why bother
—-there’s always the American
Legion.” But the prime question,
the one that is way out in front,
is “What can such an organizatiqn
do for me?”

Until recently, the club has been
purely a social organization, col-
lecting small dues, sponsoring so-
-cial events, and helping you get
into school activities. Most of you
h-ave not taken advantage of what
the club has to offer. Of approxi-
mately 400i vets at Pitt, only eight
of the old ones and twenty of the
new turned out for the ﬁrst meet-
ing this semester, after 68 had ex-
pressed active interest in the
group. And don’t lay the blame
entirely on the club, for remem-
ber, the organization is what the
members make it. However, the
active members, the nucleus of the
club, are taking steps to remedy
matters and to give you what you
want.

Realizing that the organization
could and should do more fo.r the
vets, the club is considering join-
ing a nation-wide veterans col-
legiate association. This new as-
sociation will give all college vets
the mouth-piece that they want.
It will enable clubs, with a com-
mon goal,“ to accomplish projects

many‘ other-forms of relaxation 

   
 

that the individual organizatioiis
cannot. ' ’

A meeting of all veterans will be
held in room 132 CL at 3:30 on
Friday, April 6, to discuss the pro-
posed participation in such a na-
tiional organization.

Here’s your chance to say what
you think. There is something that
the Pitt Veterans club can do for
you, and something you can do for
yourselves in a group. There are
some 400 of you, one of the largest
enrollments of vets in the coun-
try. You have a large and loud
voice if you wish to raise it.

Letter To Editor

To The Editor:

I’ve been taking a poll informal-
ly of my friends to discover what
they think of the twelfth ﬂoor
plans. It is appalling to ﬁnd how
general is cynicism and wholesale
condemnation of the idea. What
is behind it? Pure misunderstand-
ing! When I took the time to ex-
plain the real facts, my cynical
friends became enthusiastic. ‘

Students have the notion that
the twelfth ﬂoor is to replace or
compete with ‘the Tuck shops.
There is no reason for this as-
sumption. The Tuck shops oifer
one kind of relaxation; the twelfth
ﬂoor will provide a different type.
Why lobby for one against the
other? If each answers a differ-
ent need-—and it does--let’s have
both!

For the second consecutive year,

 __.t‘he bill presented by Pitt’s dele-
gates to the annual parliamentary

sessions held at the Penn State
campus last week-end became the
basis for a minority group’s re-
port. The State Debaters’ conven-

 tion, of which this year’s was the

tenth edition, featured bills pre-
sented by approximately 15 col-
leges and universities in Pennsyl-

,  Vania.

The purpose of these conven-
tions is to give college debaters
opportunity for practice in par-
liamentary procedure. This year,
two separate committees were
established, one to consider the

\ ‘problem of compulsory military

training, the other to debate the
problem of compulsory arbitration
of all labor disputes by the federal
government.

The general tone of the conven-
tion was decidedly in favor of
«voluntary settlements of both is-
-sues. The Pitt de-baters, who, had
been assigned to the committee on

‘ the labor question, had composed

abill favoring compulsory legis-

 lation, and consequently became

part of a decided minority group.

‘Their bill, after consideration by
both the committee on the labor

ebaters  Honors
-At Two Tournaments

    

Four Pitt debaters won ﬁrst
place for Pitt in the inter-state
collegiate debating tournament
which was held last Saturday at
Bowling Green college in Ohio.
Men’s Debating, the" only repre-
sentative team from Pennsylvania,
defeated opponents from ten com-
peting schools from both Ohio and
Michigan.

P‘itt’s negative team, consisting
of Leonard Walk, ‘C, and Jack Gil-
bert, C, was the only one to de-
feat all ﬁve of its opponents;
while the affirmative team, made
up of Richard Hapley, C, and Har-

ﬁve tilts, making a grand total of
eight victories out of a possible
ten. Three other schools also scor;
ed a total of eight victories,'but
Pitt was awarded ﬁrst place by
virtue of the completeness of the
negative’s victories.

The question for debate was this
year’s collegiate debating question:
“Resolved, that the federal gov-

ernment enact legislaiﬁﬂii requir-
ing the arbitration of all labor dis-
putes by compulsory means,
should all voluntary methods fail,
constitutionality conceded.” The
colleges and universities entered
in the tournament were Bowling
Green, Pitt, Western Reserve,
Central Michigan, Toledo, Akron,
Heidelberg, Detroit, Otterbein, and
Goshen. The ﬁrst four schools
named are those which achieved
eight victories, and consequently
made a four-way tie.

The tournament featured two
rounds of debate on Friday e-ven-
ing, and three rounds on Satur-
day, and in_ addition several
rounds of discussion and ex-
tempore speaking which Pitt did
not enter. The delegates were fet-
ed at both a banquet on Friday
night and a luncheon on Saturday.

Bureau Reports Rise
In City Business

According to the Bureau of Bus-
iness Research of the University,
business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict improved a little more last
week. Most of the rise was a result
of a substantial increase in trade.

1 Steel operations last week ad-
vanced to the highest level reach-
ed in the year 1945. River ship-
ments increased moderately, but
freight shipments on the railroads‘
dropped two per cent from the
preceding week.

Bank debits increased consider-
ably because of the March income
tax collections. The year-to—date
department store sales were ahead
-of those of 1944 by 20 per cent.

Spring Camp
Final Plans

Final plans have been formulat-
ed for the YM-YW spring camp
and conference at Carondawanna
on April 6, 7 and 8. This confer-
ence for association members will
include a discussion on the topic,
»“The Meaning of Christian Leader-
ship.” There will also be spe-eches
and an informal recreation pro-
gram.

Speaking at the donference will
be Rev. James B. Orr, pastor of
the Belleﬁeld Presbtyerian church;
Professor Demas Barnes of the
history department, and other
members of the University faculty.

The re-creation program, con-
ducted by Louise Johnson, C, will
include hiking, boating, canoeing,
and a camp-ﬁre. Singing, dancing,
and other informal recreation will
be led by" students in the depart-
ment of physical education at the
University. ,

Arrangements for the camp
hav-e been made by Melville Rob-
erts, C, who has taken care of
transportation, meals, and general
program planning. About half of
the baggage can be taken to the
camp by car, but the rest must be
seen to by the owners. 'l"ranspoir-
tation between the Harmony bus
depot and the camp will be fur-
nished.

It is suggested that all students
planning to attend should bring
old, knock-about clothes and ex-
tra bedding. Linen and a minimum
of blankets will be provided by
the camp, but additional covers
will probably be necessary. Also
advisable is a ﬂashlight or an elec-
tric torch.

‘Total cost for the weekend will
be $4.60, whiich includes meals,
bedding, and registration. An ad-
ditional sum of $2.80 for a round
trip ticket on the Harmony bus

Joe...

The pleasant weather Pittsburgh
has been having lately ‘is a
“homey climate” for Joseph Vi
Dal, caretaker of State hall, for in
his own country of Puerto Rico
there is warm weather all the
time. “Joe” as he is fondly called
by the students, has been a care-
taker at State hall, for three years.
He also holds the position of
watchman at Thaw hall and the
Dental School. Joe likes his work
and has made a lot of friends
among the faculty and students.
One of his more often repeated
duties has been helping the key-
forgetting professors open their
doors.

After working all week, Joe re-
laxes on Saturday in a movie. As
for his favorite actress, he thinks
Shirley Temple is beautiful and
“never misses her pictures.” His
other diversions are reading the
comic strips (especially Popeye),
and seeing baseball games.

While ’most \people have post-
war plans of luxury, Joe’s only
post-war wish is “that all the boys
come back safely. I want to see
them at State hall once more,” he
said.

Possessing an eye for statistical
ﬁgures equal to that of the male
population for hers, Betty Ellen
Whitten, BA, is a rare combina-

tion of pulchri-tude and =brainipow-

er. “Whit,” as she likes to be

«jitterbugging. (At Joe’s Barbecue
terrace.)

Whit came to Pittfrom Con-
nellsville High school, where she

Phi Delts.

Two new pledges were added to
the Beta Sig pledges group—
Grace Olekszak and Alice Blatteau,
making -a total of twenty-one.
Last Saturday the Betas held a

Other tea dances last week were
one at the Delt house for the Phi

 h...;-:2s.......--

By Jim Pettican

Long a subject of the “hepcats’ ”
scorn, sweet swing fans are ex-
pected to increase in number after
the war. Soldiers in the present
conﬁict have shown a decided lik-
' ing for the sweet sentimental
‘ type of songs. The memories of
these songs and what they have
stood for through the war years
are expected to inﬂuence the post-
war tastes of millions of today’s

servicemen.
Such songs as White Christ-
mas and I’ll Be Seeing You

have meant more to the men of
this war than all the so-called
“jumpin’-jive” songs rolled into
one.”
After returning from his USO
tour of France last year, Bing
Crosby stated that singing “White
Christmas” for the boys had given
him one of the greatest and unfor-
gettable thrills of his career. The
amiable Bing sang it on rough
board stages, from the backs of
trucks, in the tented ﬁeld hospi-
tals, right up in the front line
‘ areas, and still they wanted more.
Der Bingle explained that he al-
most hated to sing it for them, the
way it always brought the tears
to their eyes. Yet, he knew that
it was the one song they wanted
to hear above all others.
Similarly, the so-called sweet

I I‘ bands such as Guy Lombardo’s
51

I limit‘ ‘ll ill“! 

and Sammy Kaye’s, who have
persisted throughout the years
despite the upsurge of swing, are
expected to rise to new heights of
popularity after the war. Orches-
tras of this type play music in a
smooth, straightforward manner,
which the ‘jive-hounds” refer to
as “icky.” Nevertheless, it is
smooth danceable music and the
listener can recognize the tune.
So, unless all the current indi-
cations are wrong, Johnny Dough-
boy is going to advocate a sweet
music policy for the country he re-
turns to. Music that is melodic,
understandable, and possessing a
certain ‘down to earth” quality
will be the order of the day. '

Chapel Services
Sponsored By

Fraternities

Student—Faculty committee in
charge of Friday Chapel services
decided at a meeting on Friday,
March 23, to continue the plan of

- fraternity sponsorship for these

weekly religious programs.

The original plan of the commit-
tee had been to ask fraternities, as
representative campus organiza-
tions, to sponsor the services from
September until Lent in order to
-enlist student interest and sup-
port

However, Mr. Raymond F. Brit-
tain, head of the group, explained
that since many additional frater-
nities wished to participate, the
committee decided to continue the
plan of having fraternity repre-
sentation, which has been suc-
cessful.

Next year the committee will
continue to invite individuals and
groups other than fraternities to
sponsor Friday services. In this
way it intends to encourage a
larger attendance from the student
body and faculty.

In line with this plan, Chi
Omega fraternity is to sponsor the
next service on Friday, April 6,
from 1 to 1:25 o’clock. Jean

invited, for the topics to be dis‘-
cussed are of special importance to
the college student and future
community leader. A

Mrs. R. D. Campbell, president
of the local city association will
preside at the meetings, whose
topic is: “The Times dem-and!”
Such problems of ' social signi_'ﬁ-
cance will be studied as: mush-
room’ towns, world friendship and
solidarity, and inter-racial policies
and practices. 0'

A study has been made by the
national YWCA of the inter-racial
situation within our country, and
the results published under the‘
title, “Inter-racial Practices in
Community YWCA’s.” An evalu-
ation of this publication will —,be
undertaken and an attempt made
to sharpen and point up current
thinking on the question.

Also under consideration will be
the problem of ﬁnancing YWCAs
in the foreign ﬁeld. The value of
these organizations abroad has
been amply demonstrated in the
case of Belgium where more Ys

operated during the war than had 

been in existence prior to 1939.

Such activities in conquered
Europe, of course, had to be car-
ried on by underground methods
and never could the associations
meet twice in the same place.
Further, it was impossible to pre-
arrange meeting places, and a code
was devised by which members
could signal to each other on the
way to and from market. In‘ View
of such persistence, literally inde-
ﬁance of the Nazi ﬁring squads,
the Belgian request for 25 thou-
sand dollars to continue their work
will be seriously considered.

Students who desire to attend
the meetings have been requested
to sign up in the YWCA office on
the twelfth ﬂoor as soon as possi-
ble. As the sessions will last from
2 until 9 o’clock, the Central Y

‘will provide an evening meal‘; for

those who wish to eat there. ._:At-
tendance at the conference is free,
but a fee of 60 cents will be
charged to defray costs for the
meal.

Stadium Drills

With almost ﬁfty men out for
the squad, Coach Ralph Mitterling
has high hopes of breaking a jinx
that has plagued the Panther team
for the last two years—-that of try-
ring to win a ball game. But things

V shape up a little differently for
«this year. '

Back from last year's squad are
first baseman, Johnny Lozar, sec-
ond baseman Red Matthews,
catcher Joe K.’ielb, now cavorting
in the outﬁeld, and outﬁelders Ray
Reppert and Johnny Pager. Be-
sides these boys there are Sam
Consentino, Virg Fassio and Bob-
by Lucchino who have been
showing up well in spring
matches. Sam played WPIAL ball
-while {the other two, Fassio and
Lucchino, were battery—mates for
two years at South Hills High
school. Last year they led their
team to a city championship. Luc-
chino is a left-hander with a
cracking curve while Fassio dons
the pads and mask behind the
plate.

The boys have been outside for
almost two weeks now, due ‘to the
break they’ve gotten in the weath-
er. The exact date of their opening
game is, however, still unknown

_ because the athletic office has, as
yet, not released the baseball
schedule. Penn State, however,
-when they listed their games, have

i the Panthers down for a two-ser-
ies stint on a home and home
basis. Also, it is quite probable
that the Pitt boys will again meet

they have in recent years. J uniata,

Spring Program

All fraternities are anxiously
waiting for the outcome of the
undecided SAE-PiKA tilt. The de-
cision will come from OF council.
In the meantime the fraternity
teams remain inactive. Should the
PiKA’s beat -the SAES the IF
league would be thrown into a
ﬁve-way tie between the Phi
Gams, P‘iKA’s, SAEs, Phi Eps, and
Pi Larns.

Last Monday night )the ping
pong competition began. Each con-
test between two fraternities is
composed of four singles matches
and one doubles match. The team

copping at least three out of the

ﬁve contests will be the winner. A
round robin tournament is pro-
posed and the team winning the
greatest number of contests will
be the IF ping pong champs.

The IF swimming meet which
was called off due to the holidays
may be run off shortly. The types
and number of events to be run off
will be determined by IF coun-
cil and the athletic chairman.

IIiﬂeTeam
Firing In
Nationals

‘Completing their second week’s
ﬁring the Pitt Riﬂes have thus
come to the midway week in the
National Firing Match now under-
way.

As a bit of review ‘the National
Match includes the four winning
teams from each of the nine serv-
ice commands in this country. By
placing first in the Third Service
Command Match, Pitt entered its
ROTC Riﬂes team in the National
Match.

The National Firing Match cov-
ers four stages of ﬁring from dif-
ferent positions. The first stage
includes ﬁring from a phone and
sitting position; the second from
a prone and kneeling position; the
third stage from a prone and a
standing position and the fourth
stage from two prone positions.

The emphasis has been placed
upon the prone ﬁring position. Up
to the National Match the Pittites
were weakest in this position but
with much intensive practice the
ﬁrst stage showed a marked im-
provement in the tea-m’s average.
Out -of a possible perfect 1000
score the team ﬁred a high of 991.
In the second stage the Riﬂes kept
up their high average with a re-
markable 990 score.

For ‘the total tabulations for the
ﬁrst stage of the National Firing
the Blue and Gold ‘had a score of
1962 out of 2000 rounds. For the
second stage the team ﬁred a
1932. Although these sc-ores may
not seem too signiﬁcant, as com-
pared with the scores for the win-
ning “team in 1944 the score for the
ﬁrst stage was 1965. only 3 points
better than Pitt’s score. The high
score in the second stage last year
was 1897, some 35 .-points less than
Pitt’s score this year.

Thus far no comparison can be
made with the o‘ther competing
teams in this match as no scores
for these other teams have come
in

The National Match will take
two more weeks to complete all
four stages of ﬁring but before
the ﬁnal tabulations are in, an-
other week or ‘two will probably
have elapsed. For the time being,
each week’s scores will have to be
published without comparisons or
standings with the other compet-
ing teams.

Basketball marched out of the 1,

picture Thursday night in Madi-
son Square Gardens. The Cow-
boys of Oklahoma A & M became
the mythical national basketball
champions, handing De Paul an I
unexpected setback.

The Cowboys won 52 to 44 in  

an anticlimactic ﬁnish after four
DePaul players had been sent out
of the game for excessive fouling,
including George Mikan who had
broken every individual scoring
record in the «tournament books.

The crowd of 18,158 saw C-oach '

Henry Iba’s antidote for s-peed, a
dogged unyielding defense that
made the Chicagoans foul in spite

of themselves. Mikan wen-t out of. -  ;

the game in the ﬁrst 14 minutes
with 5 personal fouls against him.
Putting the -clamp -on the ‘6 foot
7-inch Blue Demon was 7 foot
Bo.b Kurland, Aggie center and
any other handy team mate as
I-ba’s “cup defense” of two men
on one was worked -to perfection.
When Mikan was tooted from
the game by Referee Pat Kennedy
he took along with him the “heart '
and soul” of «the Demons. The

Lakemen managed to stay ahead. "

the ﬁrst half desvpit-e their tre-
mendous loss. At the ﬁrs-t gun shot
De Paul led 26-21. Promptly after
the intermission, Cecil H-ankins,
Cotton Bowl football star who.

wasn’t with the Cowboys when .,  b:

they lost by two points to De Paul V.
last December, sank three ﬁeld
goals, his third shot -giving -A & M,
a 27-to-26 lead. Fr-om -ther-e on
it was all the Cowboys. 
The difference between victory
and defeat for both these teams _
rested in -the hands of their cen-
ters, and Oklahoma’s knack of
pla-cing Mik-an in the position to
foul put the boy on the bench.
The ﬁrst game of the evening
had NYU matched against Bowl-*
ing Green to decide the Number 3
team of the country. According ’to
Dr. Carlson each competing team
played a close game of ball and
one mistake spelled defeat. NYU’s
63 to 61 victory was no exception
to this. In the last ﬁve minutes
the lead changed almost at every
shot, but in the ﬁnal journey of
the second hand around the clock,

-highly-publicized Tanenbaum jus-

tiﬁed the previous ﬂattery of the
press when he leaped like a«Pan-

ther from 15 feet out to grab the _

rebound of his own shot and loop
it through to give the Violets a
62-to-61 lead. Twenty-one sec-
onds later "he whipped a free 5
throw through the net ‘to add the
ﬁnal point of the game.

News, Teaching

Ever hear of a silent partner?
Usually he is a person who does
a l-ot of work but who receives
little credit for his eflorts. Dr.
Eugene W. Miller, teacher of Latin
and Greek and faculty advisor or
the News, may he termed “silent
partner” of The Pitt News staff.
As a-dvisor, it is his task to as-
sist the staff, check copy. and read
proof. In addition, he helps the
printer set up the form of the
paper.

Dr. Miller took his undergradu-
ate work at Thiel College. In the
summer of ‘Z9 he studied at the
American School of Classical
Studies in Rome. Continuing his
graduate work at Pitt, he received
his doctor of philosophy degree in
1932. His avocation is ‘gardening.
“I’ve been more or less (he didn’t
say which) of a success as a gar-
dener,” he admitted. “You see,
I’m really a farmer at heart.” He

is also a -contributing editor of

Classical Weekly.

The Tuck shop on Monday

morning was running a -close sec-
ond to the .Spring Flower show at

Phipps’ ‘ conservatory . . . the
fragrance of gardenias, never more
than a dozen in one corsage, car-
nations, orchids, and roses per-
meated to every nook.

It is the policy of this column

‘(this week) not to mention names:

. . . but S-anker can say that some

man’s bank account must have a"
hollow ring to it after seeing the J

feminine half of Pittpourri wear-
ing a king-size post-Easter corsage
of gardenias. . . (Do you know

who Sanker means? Know who

she means?)
