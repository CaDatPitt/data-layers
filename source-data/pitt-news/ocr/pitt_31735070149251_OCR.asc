Engineering students  
build sustainable shelter

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

While it might seem daunting to
help when natural disaster strikes

around the globe, a group of stu-

dents found a way for the victims
to help themselves.

This summer, six students,
each from a different engineer-
ing ﬁeld, combined their skills to
create a shelter design for people
displaced by natural disasters en-
tirely made out of bamboo.

. Bhavna Sharma, the group’s

adviser and a professor at Pitt, as— '

signed Katie Brown, Patrick Eells,
Michael Nites, Mathew Paglias—
sotti, Abigail Stein and Chris Zim-
merman to the task as part of the
National Science Foundation’s In-
ternational Research Experiences
for Students. She challenged them
to design a temporary living struc-
ture that could quickly and easily
be assembled by local residents in
regions devastated by natural ca-
tastrophes.

Many people have created
structures of this kind in the past,
but the team presented itself with
an additional challenge: to make
the structure as environmentally
sustainable as possible.

“Our research was inspired
by two goals: disaster relief and
sustainability,” said Pagliassotti,
a junior electrical and computer
engineering major.

In 2004, the United Nations re-
leased a report that revealed that a
more efﬁcient way to immediately
assist people in countries affected

by natural disaster is to send in-

formation detailing how those
people might build temporary
shelters to protect themselves. Of-
ten, countries use the less efficient
method of sending materials and

    

manpower to build the housing
for Victims of these disasters.

In early May, the Pitt engineer-
ing students set to work building
the structure they believed would
accomplish their goal best: a rap-
idly deployable bamboo gridshell
structure. I

The gridshell structure, shaped
like an igloo, is not a new design.
However, it’s a rarity for this type
of structure to be built out of bam-
boo, as it’s usually constructed
with more sturdy Glass Fiber Re-
inforced Polymers.

'“There’s not . too much re-
search going on with [bambo0],”
said Nites, a junior industrial en-
gineering major. “Our goal was to
see what is the feasibility of using
bamboo wide-scale.”

Through their
though, the students found that
bamboo was the most sustainable
material for their project when
it’s farmed by sustainable means.
Farmers cultivate bamboo sus-
tainably by using less energy-con-
sumptive processes to harvest the
plant, such as employing an axe
rather than a chainsaw, and avoid-
ing the use of fertilizers, among
other environmental1y—friendly
tactics.

As part of its research, the
team spent two and a half weeks
in Brazil studying with a bamboo
expert in the region.

“This one guy in Brazil, his life
is bamboo,” Nites said. “He even
has a bamboo keyboard for his
computer.”

The team delved into the Bra-
zilian rainforest to see a bamboo
plantation and the farming meth-
ods common to the region ﬁrst-
hand, staying overnight in a small

Hurricane Isaac  
disrupts Republican
Nationalconvention

David Lightman
M CT Campus

TAMPA, Fla. — A Republican Na-
tional Convention already slowed
by Tropical Storm Isaac faces new
threats today from the storm, as its
trek up the Gulf Coast could make
it tough for the party to stage the
kind of j oyous, momentum-build-
ing event that often gives candi-
dates a big boost.

Mitt Romney plans to arrive
in Tampa on Tuesday, ahead of
schedule, as the convention holds
its ﬁrst full day of activity — and
as his wifemakes a prime—time
speech about him. His trip to the
convention city two days before
he is to accept the Republican
nomination was announced late
Monday.

The party is scheduled to adopt
its platform and conduct the roll
call of the states to nominate
Romney, a former Massachusetts
governor, for president and Rep.
Paul Ryan of Wisconsin for vice
president. The evening’s agenda
features Ann Romney and New
jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the
keynote speaker.

Romney is scheduled to travel
to Indianapolis on Wednesday to

speak to the American Legion, *

then return to Tampa to give his
acceptance speech Thursday night.
Tampa’s weather calmed

Monday as the storm bypassed
the Tampa Bay region‘, where the
Republicans curtailed Monday’s
planned convention opening out
of an abundance of caution. But
the storm still threatens to hit else-
where. Hurricane warnings were
issued for parts of the northern
Gulf of Mexico coast, including
New Orleans; Biloxi, Miss.; Gulf
Shores, Ala., and Pensacola Beach,
Fla., areas devastated by Hurri-
cane Katrina’s march through the
region seven years ago thisweek.

Many convention eyes, as well
as news media attention, were on
the storm Monday. 4

Isaac was forecast to make
landfall alongthe Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi or Alabama coast as a Cat-
egory 2 hurricane, with winds of
about 100 mph, late Tuesday or
Wednesday. Tropical storm force
winds, at 39 to 73 mph, could reach
parts of the states Tuesday. Evacu-
ations started in New Orleans-area
parishes.

The storm is expected to move
slowly through Louisiana and Mis-
sissippi on Thursday before losing
tropical storm status and heading
into Arkansas by Friday. Fifteen
inches of rain could fall in some
areas.

A direct hit on New Orleans
would be a fresh test of political
acumen for both major political

cabin in the wilderness.

In addition to researching, the
team also experienced Brazilian
culture during its stay: dancing
to samba music, attending a soc-
cer match and indulging in local
cuisine.

“After being down there I re-
ally caught the Brazilian bug,” said
Eells, a junior mechanical engi-

neering and materials science ma— '

jor, who plans to return to Brazil
this fall for further research with
bamboo. . -
When the six engineers re-
turned to Pitt, they ﬁrst combined
their newfound bamboo knowl-
edge with computer programs to
digitally test different dimensions

and ‘building scenarios for the '

bamboo. They had a limited sup-
ply of 100 ten-foot bamboo col-

I umns —- ameasurement of bam-

boo equal to 1,000 feet — to work
with, and 'so they used technology

.to avoid dwindling their supply
- through trial and error. I

The team members said the
most difﬁcult part of the process
was the short amount of time
remaining in their program to
complete the project after they re-
turned from Brazil. V

“We only had six to seven
weeks when we got back. It was
kind of like we were in panic

‘ mode,” Eells said.

way to build their structure, they
began the process of physically

* constructing a prototype.

They set up the prototype on
the small grassy square outside
Benedum Hall on the day before
they presented their completed
project to the public onjuly 19.

To pitch the structure, the
team members ﬁrst created a two-
dimensional bamboo . grid, which
they laid ﬂat on the grass. The
pieces of bamboo were tied to-
gether using plastic zip ties. They

, then picked up the center of the

grid and used a rope and pulley
system to raise the structure.
After bracing the structure
with a bamboo collar, the struc-
ture was self-supporting, main-
taining the igloo—like shape. The
ends of the bamboo poles were
staked into the ground. This pro-
cess turned the two—dimensional
structure into a three-dimension-

‘al temporary home in less than
A four hours. -

“We could deﬁnitely get it done
in less than two hours if we did it
again,” Nites said.

In a true test of the structure’s
ability to withstand the elements,
_it was subjected to the whiplash of
a strong Pittsburgh thunderstorm
the single night it stood on the
lawn, and made it through to the
morning looking sturdy as ever.

“We were excited about that,”
Nites said.

The group admitted in its ﬁnal
presentation that there are some

The team still needs to test out .

the type of material that would
make the most sustainable cov-
ering for its bamboo skeleton.

There’s also some economic chal- .

lenges that bamboo farmers in
foreign countries must be will-.
ing to meet if they are to sacriﬁce
purely mass bamboo farming for
a more sustainable bamboo farm-
ing. ’

However, the team members
see great potential in their project.

“Our goal is to get published
and present our research at a few

‘ conferences,”Nites said. ’

The majority of the students
involved have expressed interest
in continuing to work on elements
of their bamboo project this se-
mester.

The group’s advisor, Sharma,
expressed satisfaction with her
team’s efforts.

' “In terms of their output, I’m
very happy,” Sharma said. “This is
sort of a beginning phase to iden-
tify possible problems in using
bamboo. They’ll be reﬁning what
they’ve done through ﬁirther re-
search.” . ‘

Beyond getting its research
published in an academic forum,
the team wants to assure its de-
sign is one day ready to help mil-
lions of displaced civilians around
the world. «

“The human aspect is almost
the entire reason we did it,” said
Brown, a senior chemical engi-
neering major. ﬂ

parties.

' Then-President George W. Bush was
criticized for the federal government’s re-
sponseto Katrina’s aftermath. Mindful of
that experience, Republicans abbreviated
the program on the ﬁrst day of their 2008
convention after Hurricane Gustav threat-
ened the Gulf, postponing an appearance
by Bush, even though the convention was
in St. Paul, Minn. _ _

This year, Monday’s convention session
was shortened to a 10-minute affair that
conducted no major business. Delegates
seemed wary of any more big changes to
the convention they have been eagerly an-
ticipating for months.

P “The world goes on,” said Jim Ayala, a
Henderson, Nev., home inspector.

“We have a responsibility to go ahead
and get Gov. Romney’s message out,” said

' A.J-. Matthews, a retired police officer from

Tampa. “We might take a more somber ap-
proach.” - .

Speakers can still offer contrasts to Presi-
dent Barack Obama, added Brock Cordeiro,
a Dartmouth, Mass., sheriff ’s aide. “We just
may have to cut back on the cheerleading,”
he said. .

Convention organizers werebeing cir-
cumspect about their plans.

“We are continuing to go ahead with our

program of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs— _ .

day. We’ll see what happens over the ‘next
few days,” said Russ Schriefer, a top Romney
strategist. “Obviously our ﬁrst concern is
the people in the path of the storm,” he said.

The storm also could become a costly po-
litical distraction if it pushed all—important
news coverage of the convention out of the

spotlight. In 2008, about 40 million view-'

ers watched the two candidates’ acceptance
speeches, with the address by Republican
nomineejohn McCain getting slightly higher
ratings.

This year, the storm threatens to distract
TV coverage from an already abbreviated
schedule of convention coverage. Some TV
anchors, including Anderson Cooper of CNN
and Shepard Smith of Fox News, were dis-
patched to the storm site.

Storm coverage could work to Obama’s
advantage, at least initially.

“The president gets the bully pulpit. He
can go to the scene and be photographed
helping put sandbags up. About all Romney
can do is react,” said Kenn Venit, a Connecti-
cut media consultant. -

If New Orleans survives without much
damage, he said, the story line also could
work to Obama’s beneﬁt. “This would be the
ﬁrst big test of how_the system was fixed,”
Venit said. '

Romney strategists said they weren’t con-
cerned that the message would be muted.
“We have 15,000 people in the hall ready to
get the message out,” senior Romney adviser
Ron Kaufman said. “I promise you by the
end of these three days you’ll feel like you’ve
heard four days of messages.” I

INTERNSHIPS

tion, the University’s Office of Career
Development and Placement Assistance
is unveiling an initiative that guarantees
every undergraduate the opportunity of
an internship,” the press release said.

According to the press release, the
new Internship Preparedness Program
will focus on six different topics: resumé
formatting and content, resumé review
and internship focus, preparation for an
internship interview, networking skills,
internship searching and succeeding in
an internship.

Following those six sessions, students

will work with CDPA staff to go through
mock interviews and find internships
that work for them.

This announcement comes on the
heels of The Princeton Review ranking
Pitt 19th for careernservices out of 377
nationally-recognized colleges.

Rob Franek, the editor of The Princ-

' eton Review, described Pitt’s rating even

before this announcement as “superla-
tive.”

“We asked, what are the things Pitt is
doing to make sure students are ready
to move on after college,” he said. “And
compared to 376 other colleges, Pitt was
one of the best.”-

COLUMN

Cleveland and Buffalo _— vacation
spots for future Americans?

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

A lot has been going on in Flor-
ida lately. Bath salts, the elderly
and politicians just can’t seem
to stay away from all the sun-
shine and alligators. There’s
the Republican National Con-
vention in Tampa, Dwight How-
ard’s speeding-out—of-town tire
marks in Orlando and I think
there’s still some leftover Snoo-
ki mess down in Miami.

But you see, all of that is
manageable. Just wear a face

-mask and hate taxes and you

can ﬁt in perfectly in this little
slice of paradise. There’s only
one issue with this place: hur-
ricanes. I’m not afraid to say it.
When there’s a hurricane com-
ing, who wants to live in Flori-
da? Or in the similarly—afflict-
ed Carolinas, for that matter?
Geez, even the Northeast has
gotten hit recently.

But hurricanes aren’t the
only thing that kind of sucks
about this country. There are
droughts in the Southwest, un-
bearable heat in the non—coast-
al South, freezing cold in the
upper Midwest, and California

might be earthquaking itself to
island status.

The United States is ﬁlled
with places that everybody
wants to call paradise. Florida:
Hurricanes. Virginia: ‘Swamps.
Carolinas: Vacationers. Texas:
Heartburn. Hawaii: Long-dis-
tance calls. Guess what? Hurri-
canes don’t happen in my para-
dise.

Whether you want to blame '

it on global warming, changing
weather patterns or Poseidon,
the reality is that our world is
going to be very different in the
future. Things that might not
have mattered before are going
to become vitally important to

A our future survival.

What are these things? Well,
I might not be a scientist, but I
would say that to be successful
in the future,‘ an area is going to
need a fresh water supply, mod-
erate temperature and safety
from-Mother Earth’s rage.

Yes, you guessed it. The
three cities that are going to be
paradise in the next Mayan age
are going to be Cleveland, Buf-
falo, N.Y., and Pittsburgh.

Think about it! The Great
Lakes are there to provide the
flock of new residents from the

drought-ridden South with wa-
ter. The land mass in between
these cities and the ocean
means no hurricanes, but a
reasonable driving distance to
beaches. There is a great deal
of basic infrastructure from the
old days of manufacturing.
Seriously, who wants to live
on a beach nowadays when you
could live in Buffalo? What’s go-

ing to harm you in Cleveland —

a big, bad wave from Lake Erie?
I think that we can go ahead
and agree that all three of these
cities are going to rise" in the
rankings. By 2025, New York,
Los Angeles and Miami will be
replaced by these megacities of
the Great Lakes. The only thing
left to decide is which of these
cities will come out on top.

In third place, beating out
Detroit by a hair, is Buffalo. If
it weren’t for” the close prox-
imity to Canada, this ranking
might be a little higher. Let’s
be real though, it’s pretty un-
American to be so close to a dif-
ferent country. I will spare the
city from further accusations,
however, because of the Buf-
falo wing. What could be more

A Study in Stigma: How mental illness is like Herpes

' ' Tracey Hickey
Colummst

One in four. That’s how many
American adults suffer from
some form of mental illness ev-
ery year, and it’s also how many
American adults are reported to
live with the herpes simplex vi-

. rus. And while mental illness isn’t

vi_ral or sexually transmitted, and
herpes doesn’t affect brain func-
tion, there are a lot of similarities
in how either diagnosis will affect
your life. , .
Mental illness,-. like the herpes
virus, tends to produce symp-
toms sporadically, rather than
constantly. The outbreaks » of

' painful sores most commonly. as-

x

. Thfpiﬂﬂgmﬁ 

i.- ., 4-... -c.,.....- ,.

sociated with herpes are called
“ﬂare-ups,” while people with de-
pression have “episodes.” People
with bipolar disorder have epi-
sodes of both depression and ma-
nia, and people with anxiety dis-
orders have “attacks” _of anxiety. ’

Herpes — I refer mostly to
genital herpes throughout this
column, especially whentalking
about stigma — is treatable, but
not curable. Antiviral medication
can prevent outbreaks of herpes
symptoms but the virus is never
fully removed from the body.

The question V of treatment

versus cure for mental ‘illness is
more complicated. There is no
such thing as a “depression virus”

that remains in the body despite '

lack of symptoms, and so with
mental illness the symptoms are
the disease and a person who is
not experiencing symptoms of
depression might not be consid-
ered clinically depressed. How-
ever, people who receive treat-
ment for a mental illness often
relapse after being healthy and
happy for years at a time. Psy-
chotic disorders such as schizo-
phrenia have an especially high
relapse rate. and most of them
are considered lifelong condi-
tions, but frequent relapse has

also been observed with depres-

sion, anxiety disorders, bipolar
disorder and eating disorders, to
name just a few. I

' The swinging pendulum of
recovery and relapse leads me to
imagine mental illness, like her-
pes, as a virus that remains in the
body even when symptoms aren’t
being displayed. To speak for my-
self, I would like to wean myself
off my antidepressants within
the next three years. There is a
strong chance that I will ﬁnd my-
self choosing to go back on them
later in life when the symptoms
will likely reappear.

This is not to say that treat-
ment is futile —‘— on the contrary,
regarding mental illness as a
lifelong, sometimes-dormant
condition is a great way to keep
yourself vigilant against future
outbreaks and . allow yourself
to ﬁght relapses before they eat
away at too much of your ‘prog-
ress. °

But the most‘ glaring simi-
larity between herpes and the
wide variety of mental health
conditions plaguing Americans
is that despite their common
and treatable nature, both come

. with an incredible stigmafl am

able to speak publicly about my
depression because it is being
de—stigmatized faster than other
mental illnesses, and because
I’m not going into a career where
a squeaky-clean bill of mental
health is considered necessary.
If, for example, I suffered from
bipolar disorder and wanted to
work with children, you would
almost-deﬁnitely not be reading
this column. '

A friend‘ of mine, loosely diag-
nosed with psychotic depression,
decided against an inpatient stay
at Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic when she felt it would
have beneﬁtted her because she
was counseled that such a treat-

ment could disqualify her from
being licensed as a social worker
when she completed her studies.
It’s hard to imagine a med stu-
dent being told that she can’t be a
gynecologist because of her own

‘ovarian cysts, but having your

own mental health care needs is
believed to make you less ﬁt to
address the mental health needs
of others.

Likewise, herpes carries such
a harsh stigma that people don’t
even want to risk association
with those who carry the virus. At
the Scarleteen.com sex education
site, columnist Leah Berkenwald
talks about writing a paper on so-
cial attitudes toward herpes, and
she worried that people would
assume she was infected simply.
because she was writing about it.
I brieﬂy worried the same thing
when I started this column. As of
my last sexual health check-up, I
do not have genital herpes — but
if I did, would I have the guts to
write about it? In all likelihood,
no.

Like more serious mental ill-
nesses, herpes is overwhelmingly
discussed not_as a condition that
affects real people, but as a punch
line. Think about it.— when was
the last time you heard someone
refer to either herpes or schizo-

phrenia in terms of the actual
medical conditions, rather than
as a joke or as shorthand for
“slutty” or “crazy”? Such jokes
use herpes as a catch-all sym-
bol for dirty, irresponsible sex,
while schizophrenia refers to any
amount of perceived instability.
More tellingly — imagine that
you were in a group of people jok-
ing about illness this way. If you
interrupted them in a‘ serious
tone and said, “Hey, I ﬁnd that
offensive because I have herpes”
or “I have schizophrenia,” what
would their ﬁrst reaction be?
They might think you were also
joking.

The ' conclusion is obvious.
Stigma against a disease invari-
ably, prevents sufferers from
seeking and obtaining treatment
—- in the case of mental illness,
this can lead to addiction or self-
harm, and in the case of herpes
itgoften prevents sufferers from
disclosing their infected status

‘to sexual partners. Whatever we

think we gain from snidely mor-
alizing against herpes or mental
illness sufferers as dirty, promis-
cuous, weak or self-absorbed, it
isn’t worth the public health toll
involved.

Gene Kelly3 Pitt alumnus,
Hollywood legend

Gene Kelly danced from Pitt's campus to Hollywood, becoming a popular star.

 

Anna Weldon
Impulse Editor

Even drenched in water, Gene Kelly could
still dance and sing his way to a thrilling

performance that captured audiences’ .

hearts.

“Everyone wanted to be Gene Kelly,”
said Kiesha Lalama, the education director
for the Pittsburgh CLO and the director of

 “Jthe CLO’s Gene Kelly Awards.

Gene Kelly, a popular American actor,
director and choreographer, graduated
from Pitt in 1933 with a degree in econom-
ics. With his class, style and sheer perfec-
tionism, Kelly brought a masculine pride
to musical ﬁlm that continues to resonate
in today’s performances. Known mostly
for his work in the 1952 musical “Singin’
in the Rain” and his reputation for being
the all-American man who reinvented the
masculine character in musical ﬁlm, Kelly
went on to ‘perform in, direct and choreo-
graph a variety of musicals. Originally from
Pittsburgh, he died on Feb. 2, 1996, but
his legacy continues with the celebration
of the 100th anniversary of his birth on
Aug. 23, 2012.

To celebrate his legacy, Pitt has desig-
nated two events in honor of his afﬁlia—
tion with the school. Umbrella-wielding
students danced to the “Cupid Shuffle” to
commemorate his birthday on Aug. 23, and

a Bachelor of Arts in economics

Served as the director of the Uni-
‘ versity’s Cap and Gown Club from
1934 to 1938

Worked in his family’s dance
studio in Squirrel Hill and cho-
reographed for the Pittsburgh
Playhouse and Nixon Theater

Wanted to be a Pirates shortstop

Performed in the film “Singin’ in
the Rain” in 1952

Was the 25th Screen Actors Guild
Life Achievement Award recipient
in 1988

Died on Feb. 2, 1996

on Oct. 25, Kelly’s widow, Patricia Kelly,

will host “Pitt’s Gene Kelly Centennial Cel-
ebration” that will focus on Kelly’s ﬁlm ca-
reer, with Pittsburgh—related commentary.

Kelly attended Pitt before beginning
his entertainment career. He graduated in
1933 with a Bachelor of Arts in econom-
ics. He also worked at his family’s dance
studio, then located in Squirrel Hill, and
choreographed musicals at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse and Nixon Theater.

Soon after moving out of Pittsburgh,
Kelly began working on the Broadway show

“Pal Joey.” As a character of the original.

cast in 1939, he played the audacious and
crafty Joey Evans who, unlike many of
Kelly’s later characters, didn’t necessar-
ily represent the “all-American guy.”

“Paljoey” — a Rodgers and Hart musi-
cal — was Kelly’s breakout role, introduc-
ing him to musical ﬁlm and steering him
away from musical theater. Because of this
role, he went on to work onhis ﬁrst ﬁlm
in 1942 with MGM, “For Me and My Gal.”
Kelly performed the role of Harry Palmer,
another bold character somewhat similar
to his previous role of Joey Evans.

“It was only later that he became known
for playing all-American type guys. Even
then, he always had a sort of arrogance in
his star image that made him have a sort
of an edge,” said Jane Feuer, a professor
of film studies at Pitt and a judge for the
Gene Kelly Awards, local musical theater
accolades recognizing high-school-aged
performers. '

Feuer said Kelly invoked a more “mascu-
line character through his roles that helped
to recreate the male lead in musicals.

“The previous male star was Fred
Astaire, who didn’t have a macho image.
Gene Kelly was always this kind of brash
guy from Pittsburgh,” she said.

Lalama sees Kelly’s contributions as
monumental for the present-day male
dancer.

“He had such style and grace. I think
he paved the way for many male dancers
to be themselves,” she said.

His contributions as an actor continued '

to inﬁltrate his career as he delved into
choreography. Because he danced more
masculinely, he choreographed for men
to look masculine, as well.

“His contribution to choreography is
that he choreographed men to dance roles
as men, to dance as masculine characters
like sailors or baseball players. A lot of the
dancing was masculine, relative to the bal-

, city to pursue his acting ca-

. Provost and Dean of Students

let and ballroom dancing in
other ﬁlms,” Feuer said.
And although he left the

reer, Kelly always continued
to portray himself as a real
Pittsburgher. Feuer explained
that Kelly lived in Pittsburgh
until he was almost 30 years
old, establishing a solid con-
nection with the city.

“He wasn’t just someone
who was born here and left.
He had his education here,”.
she said.

And according to Pitt Vice

Kathy Humphrey, that educa-
tion was a pivotal one.

“I think that — not only
Gene Kelly —— we have incred-
ible people that have gradu-
ated from this University
because this is an incredible
institution, and itjust creates
incredible talent,” Humphrey
said during the Aug. 23 um-
brella dance commemorating
Kelly’s birthday.

“I just think it’s awesome
that we have an_ opportunity
to celebrate one of our own,”
she said.  —

One ofKelly’s most recog-
nizable achievements is his
performance in “Singin’ in the
Rain.” This performance, par-
ticularly the umbrella dance
that acted as inspiration for -
the freshmen tribute, now
acts as Kelly’s greatest claim A '
to his legacy.

“It’s so happy. It’s cheer-
ful. It’s very well done,” Feuer
said. ~

Kelly developed a standard
for the arts that continues to —
inﬁltrate .different realms of
education. Because of his ver-
satility as a performer and his
many interests that extended
from musical ﬁlm and theater,

Kelly offered much more to his audiences,

Lalama explained.

“There’s a value to the legacy of Gene
Kelly and everything he did that just adds
substance to everything Pittsburgh does,”
she said.

And his legacy continues to spread with

“He was a very important Hollywood

A 36-year-old man just a year
removed from a broken neck
shufﬂes backwards, looks down

 ‘:3 ﬁeld full of some ofthe world’s

fastest men in cleats, throws an
oblong ball in the direction of
one of his wide receivers and
is then lifted and thrown to the
ground by a muscular 255—pound

gﬁdefender.

It wasn’t the first hit Peyton
Manning had taken in his life, but
it was certainly the most highly
anticipated one.

As the Denver Broncos’ new
surgically repaired quarterback

’ ‘pulled himself up off the grass,

there was an eerie moment of
uncertainty.
Could he throw on the next

play? Was he going to have to
take a breather? Would his head
pop off his body after such a hit?

The fanatical worry of Bronco
fans was staring them in the face
— all of their biggest nightmares
had an opportunity to come into

fruition. But then, as he has done’

so many times in his career,
Manning stood up, adjusted his
shoulder pads andjogged up to
the line of scrimmage for the
next play after ﬁnding his re-
ceiver for a 38-yard completion.

On Sunday, Denver'got a
glimpse of what’s to come from
its new quarterback, who begins
his Broncos career after spend-
ing more than a decade dominat-
ing the NFL with the Indianapolis
Colts.

While playing against one of"

the NFL’s best defenses, Manning
was —— pun intended — surgical.

 

Quarterback Peyton Manning (18) has looked sharp during the Denver Broncos’ preseason games. MCT

He completed 10-of—12 passes for
122 yards and two touchdowns
in a preseason game versus San
Francisco.

Unfortunately for the 49ers,
Manning did all that work in less

, than a quarter of football. With

less than a minute to go in the
opening period, Manning had al-
ready accumulated those impres-
sive numbers. He then watched
the rest of the game wearing a
visor on the sidelines.

“I thought we°did some good
things today,” Manning told a

‘crowd of reporters after the

game.

No, you did some great things

revival, and anyone who saw

“I think what’s neat about the .

RlGHT OFF THE BATKO

Batko: Fantasy football players should practice moderation

Brian Batko
Stcqj’ Wrz'ter

Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jordy
Nelson hauls in a 30-yard touchdown pass
with 23 seconds left in the game. He’s on
your fantasy team, so you cheer. Except
———— oh.wait — you just lost.

This is just one of many imbroglios
(yes, I just used the word “imbroglio” in a
fantasy football column, please don’t stop
reading) that can — and will —— arise when
you have too many fantasy football teams.
Nelson’s touchdown grab might help one
of your teams, but could simultaneously
mean death for another.

And that’s nothing compared to the

'age—old conundrum in which your al-

legiances to your real-life favorite NFL
teams and players are tested, thanks to
fantasy football.

Let’s face it, anyone who’s ever played
fantasy football has become obsessed with
it, and the popularity of the game contin-
ues to rise at an unbelievable rate.

For some, the craze has gone a bit too
far. I’m talking to you, guy who owns nine
different fantasy football teams in eight
different leagues.

Seriously, if it’s not too late, keep the
teams to a minimum. One is ideal. Two

is acceptable. Three is really starting to
push the envelope. Any more than three
embodies the exact type of goofy fantasy
football behavior l’m talking about.

First off, it results in the irritating and
unavoidable aforementioned conﬂicts of
interest. It’s already difficult enough to
try and reconcile your fantasy football
rooting interests with those of the team
you cheer for in real life.

If you’re a Denver Broncos fan play-
ing against your pseudo-friend from high
school who used to date your current girl—
friend and owns Peyton Manning, let’s

face it — you’re probably rooting for Man— 
ning to have an awful game, despite your

Broncos spirit. . V

It’s just not a fun situation,'provided 
you’re a somewhat normal human being, ‘

that does not enjoy inescapable disap-
pointment. And when the fantasy football
gods decide they really hate you, that’s
when Manning throws for five touchdowns
and 400 yards and the Broncos still some-
how lose. - ,

To avoid getting blindsided by the fan-
tasy-related issue that arises when playing
in too many leagues too often, do yourself
a favor and remind yourself now that your

Monday’s Puzzle Solved

 12  
passing yards and 4,000 completions is

no longer a distant memory. He has re-
turned.

Even more worrisome for the rest of the‘

AFC West is word that Manning isn’t'just
back to his old ways on the ﬁeld, he’s back
to his old ways off the field, too.

Immediately after signing his contract
with the Broncos, Manning’s work began.
He organized workouts "around the city.
He spent mornings rehabbing and nights
learning the playbook.

In May, the Broncos veterans realized
something quite surprising: Manning

Orton added. “He’s so good at taking an
unknown or young receiver and making
his career blossom.”

So, after one of the biggest offseason
moves in recent history, the Broncos’ door
to success is beginning to open, and Man-
ning is the one turning the handle.

But what of their former starting quar-
terback, the man who couldn’t lose, Tim
Tebow? .

Well, Tebow, now with the New York
Jets, is a member of the ﬁrst offense since
the 1977 Atlanta Falcons to go without a
touchdown in its first three preseason
games. While Manning was dismantling
the 49ers, Tebow was busy going 4—of-14
for 55 yards and one interception against

you care about the most. '

It’s almost an absolute certainty that
the league you’re in “just for fun” will natu-
rally be the one that your team dominates
(probably because you decided to make
a waiver_ claim on a whim for some guy
named “Richard Goodman” after he had
a nice week once, and then he ends up de-
stroying all comers henceforth), while the
league that you have sunk your life savings
into for the eighth year in a row becomes
a hopeless proposition by week four.

No matter how bad it gets, your fan-

tasy struggles don’t give you a license

to project your pain onto others. I long
for a world in which telling others about
your fantasy football team ad nauseam
results in the offender becoming a social

' pariah. The majority of the time, very

few people, if any, care that if your kicker
didn’t get hurt in the third quarter, you
totally would’ve gotten your first win this
week. By midseason, I can almost assure
you that none of your friends give a rat’s
behind how lucky your opponent was to
have beaten you.

Essentially, controlling fewer teams
gives you a greater ability to ﬁght the
urge to be that guy that bores and an-
noys friends and acquaintances alike with
your endless fantasy football anecdotes.

To wrap things up, ignore everything
I just said if you’re one of those individu-
als that_play in online Yahoo leagues with
random people just for kicks. I abhor you.
There is absolutely no saving you, and may
god have mercy on your soul. Q

positive,” he said. “If we kept doing well,
we’d ‘get our break, and we ﬁnallygot a
scholarship now.” .
Barthelemy said it was something that
he’s been thinking about for a long time.
“Growing up, it’s always been a dream
to play here,” the long snapper said. “Even

just the opportunity to walk on was pretty ,

cool. Now, to earn a scholarship, it’s a
lot better.”

Wuestner, a Carlisle, Pa., native who
was extremely low on,the wide receiver
depth chart entering camp, started get-
ting more repetitions as camp went on.
He made the most of those opportunities,

grabbing. the attention of coaches. with a I

few spectacular catches.

“It’s crazy how a few guys go down, and
they call your name, and you ‘had to know
plays,” he said. “You just go out there and
try to work hard, learn the offense and do
what you can.”

Chryst also announced that sophomore
Lloyd Carrington, who was expected to
be a backup cornerback this season af-
ter playing in seven games last year, had
decided to transfer to an undetermined
school closer to his home in Texas.

But Pitt picked up a transfer when
Wisconsin wide receiver Manasseh Gar-
ner, who played prep football locally at
Brashear High School, decided to move
closer to home and become a Panther.

Garner will have to sit out this sea-
son because of NCAA transfer rules.
He will be a senior with one year of
eligibility remaining when the 2013
season starts. I
