Pitt inside linebacker Amir Purifoy (I9) pulls down Penn State tailback Cordell Mitchell for a 6-yard loss on third down, forcing PSU to punt on its last possession. Pitt couldn't move
the boil down the field to score and tie thegame. Three sacks on quarterback Matt Lytle and a dropped fourth-down pass to Kenney Ketchen ended Pitt’s hopes — PSU won 20-13.

Senlor Football Wrlter

With 21 seconds remaining in
Saturday’s Pitt-Penn State slugfest, the
largest Pitt Stadium crowd in nine
years took a deep breath.

Facing a fourth-and-26- and down
by a touchdown, Matt Lytle rolled out
of the pocketand ﬂung a desperation
pass to Kenney Ketchen, who was sta-
tioned right at the first-down marker.

Ketchen jumped and wrapped his
hands around the ball, snaring the pass

just as the crowd of 56,743 fans sucked
the last particles of air out ’ of the
Oakland area.

Then PSU safety Askari Adams
drilled the Pitt junior from behind.

The ball popped loose, the fans
breathed out, and the 94th edition of a
classic’ college rivalry ended with a 20-
13 Penn State victory. _

“You can’t deny the ﬁghting spir-
it,” said Pitt coach Walt Harris, who
praised the fans for their support in his
postgame press conference.

But he quickly added, “There are

no moral victories. We’re pissed about
losing.”

The Panthers stayed within 10
points until the closing seconds of the
third quarter, when Chaﬁe Fields beat
Pitt comerback Tray Crayton on a 60-
yard touchdown reception. The pass
accounted for nearly half of Penn
State’s aerial output, which was severe-
ly diminished by dropped passes and
overthrown balls thr‘6'ughout the first
half.

Penn State’s offense may have
taken itself out of the game early, but it

was the Pitt run defense that solved the
Nittany attack late in the contest. The
Lions notched only four first downs the
entire second half, with Phil Clarke and
Ken Kashubara doing most of Pitt’s
defensive damage on the front line.

PSU running back Cordell Mitchell
had only 9 yards in the second frame —
a fact not lost on Harris as he compli-
mented his defenders.

“Our defense, I thought, stood up
and fought them like we knew they
could,” said Harris.

teddy bears for   kids

Erin Llndeman

For The Pitt News

When a violent crime is committed,
police become so involved in appre-

_ hending suspects and securing the crime

scene that sometimes the little details,
like children involved, are overlooked.

But if a few Pitt sororities and fra-
temities- have anything to say about it,
that may change. . ‘

Several University-affiliated organi-
zations sponsored Teddies 4 Tots, a pro-
gram where teddy bears were donated
for children who have been involved in
or witnessed a violent crime.

Sigma Delta Tau sorority, the Hillel
Foundation and Kappa Sigma fraternity
collected teddy bears last week. for the
children. The bears were presented to
Ofﬁcer Ashley Thompson of Zone 6 of
the Pittsburgh Police Friday during a

dedication ceremony.

_The teddy bears will be given to
children by a police ofﬁcer on the scene
of a crime.

Close to 250 teddy bears were col-
lected, and people are still bringing them
to the sorority house. ’

Similar fund raisers have been done
for Zone 6, but this project is the ﬁrst
associated with the University,
Thompson said. 1

The program received more than
$400 worth of donations from the
Oakland community to buy more bears.
CJ Ba1ney’s, Peter’s Pub, Inka Dinka

SD00 and Subway donated gift certiﬁ-

cates. The Pitt Stop, the Pitt Shop and
the University bookstores all donated
gift certiﬁcates and teddy bears.

A street newspaper provides informa-

also provides information to help people
who are not homeless better understand
homeless issues. -

homeless, fearing that they will ‘not use the
money wisely or thinking that they do not
deserve it because they are not working,”

“Our purpose is to spread awareness of
poverty and homeless issues in the commu-

lnclianci University student aids in bank robbery

Brett Wallace and Andy Gammlll
"Indiana Daily Student

BLOOMINGTON, Ind (U —WIRE) —

~~A Tuesday afternoon bank robbery ended

with one suspect dead and another suspect,
an Indiana University student, in police
custody.

Bloomington police are investigating

the dead man’s involvement in several ‘

other local robberies.

Police identiﬁed the student as sopho-
more Timothy S. Jocic, 20, who also works
for IU Campus Card Services. The second
suspect was identiﬁed as Bloomington res-
ident Michael S. Bradack.

The robbery occurred at NBD Bank,
965 S. College Mall Road. Police recov-
ered about $20,000 from the front seat of

. the suspects’ vehicle.

Jocic was charged with bank robbery,
said FBI Special Agent Robert Molina. He
was transported Tuesday around 10:30
p.m. to a federal holding facility in
Indianapolis. ~

Around 1:30 p.m., a man wearing a
black ski cap, black clothing and sunglass-
es entered the bank and cocked a
Browning-type 9 mm pistol, said Bill
Blackketter of NBD corporate investiga-
tions. The suspect also was carrying a dark
green backpack.

The man told the four or ﬁve cus-
tomers and ﬁve employees in the bank,

A “Put your hands up,” Blackketter said. He

then handed the bag to two tellers, who
emptied their cash drawers into it.

A customer at the drive—up window
during the time of the robbery, TU junior
Mike Weaver, noticed something wrong.

“All of a sudden, the teller stopped
talking,” Weaver said. “When I looked up,
[the teller] had his back to me. There was a
guy in there waving a gun and holding a
bag.”

Weaver drove next door to A.G.
Edwards and Sons Inc., an investment
advisory service, and told the receptionist
to call the police.

“I took a step outside and was looking
at the bank when the .guy came rtmrting out,

kind of toward me,” Weaver said.

The suspect‘ ﬂed through the front
doors of the bank and turned right toward a
waiting black Jeep Grand Cherokee,
Blackketter said. The suspect got into the
car, where Jocic was waiting in the vehi-
cle’s driver-side seat, Bloomington Police
Capt. William Parker said. The vehicle

sped through an alley toward College Mall.’

Parker said another witness also took
action.

“Another customer — and this is
unbelievable — chose to follow the sus-
pect,” Parker said “['I'he two vehicles]
passed a police car. The people who were
following [the Jeep] were waving their

"hands and honking their horn. These people

were really putting their lives on the line.”

Oﬂicers then began their pursuit of the
Jeep. It eventually led west into the resi-
dential area where Jocic lives.

Police closed off the comer of Hunter
and Faculty avenues, blocking the Jeep’s
path. Jocic tried to turn and lost control of

the Jeep. With police ptnsuing, the passen- ,

ger of the car jumped out and ran north on
Faculty, Parker said Jocic then exited the
car and ran west on Hunter.

Ofﬁcers followed both suspects. Jocic
ran from police, but once they caught him,
he did not resist, Parker said. Oﬂicers
knocked Jocic to the ground and arrested
him one block from his house. He was not
armed.

Police ordered Bradack to stop, and he
did. Then, before police could apprehend

him, he shot himself in the head The one
shot ﬁred from the gun killed him, Parker
said The Jeep and gun were impounded.

Once under arrest, Jocic confessed to
driving the “getaway car.” Jocic later was
taken to Bloomington Hospital to have his
lmee examined J ocic claimed the knee was
injured when police knocked him‘ down.

Bradack also is being investigated for a
connection to a string of recent robberies in
the Bloomington area. Parker emphasized
that- it is too early to tell if Jocic was
involved in the robberies.

Parker said there are similarities
between this robbery and the robberies of a
Steak ‘n Shake, two robberies of a
Hampton Inn, and the robberies of several
Bigfoot convenience stores.

Moore and Lyle Sclair of the Hillel

“I hope not a single teddy bear,_

event that a child does witness a violent
crime and hugs one of these stuffed ani-
mals, he or she will feel a hug back from
all those involved in Teddies 4 Tots.”

Sclair spoke brieﬂy about the Jewish

fund raiser for the Pittsburgh Police.

The idea for this project came from
a sorority convention held in Tampa, Fla.
Each sister was to bring a teddy bear to
the convention, and all bears were given
to the Tampa police.

The fund raiser was part Sigma

the prevention of child abuse.

“We want the old reputation [of
Greeks] as only partiers to be lifted,”
said Jaime Wheaton, Sigma Delta Tau’s

Impeach Clinton for lying, not
for adulterous affair  

The Christian Coalition held its
armual “Road to Victory” convention
in Washington, D.C., this past week-
end, with many calling for the
impeachment of President Clinton.

However, the coalition has taken
the opportunity to further its own
political goals and is using.Clinton to
push its “moral values” agenda.

Ralph Reed, the coalition’s for-
mer executive director, said,
“Character matters, and the American
people are hungry for that message.
We care about the conduct of our lead-
ers, and we will not rest until we have
leaders of good moral character.”

No article of the Constitution says
that the president has to be of “good
moral character.” While Americans
deserve to know whether their presi-
dent is a philanderer, adultery is not
something on which he should be
impeached; he should be impeached
for lying under oath about the affair,
obstructing justice, and manipulating
others into lying about it.

Unfortrmately, the coalition’s dra-
conian “moral values” agenda is gain-
ing ground fast, and C1inton’s affair is
the high-octane fuel it was looking
for.

“Let me offer a small piece of
advice to any candidate who is on the
wrong side of the values issue,” said
Randy Tate, the coalition’s present
executive director. “You are going to

have one big problem on Election
Day.” .

Though the coalition is dismayed
that 60 percent of the population does-
n’t care about the president’s adultery,
according to ‘opinion polls, ‘tire coali-
tion appears to be making it apolitical
issue for its own gain. 

Of course, the coalitior1:.,'I:lj1'as--nof

problem sinking its talons into any
meaty scandal for political  and
Republican —— convenience. Need we
mention that it has not criticized
House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, who admitted
to having a ﬁve—year adulterous affair
in the ‘60s? '

Using Clinton as an example to
push forward its pro-farnily, pro-life,
pro-religious-domination message is
shamelessly opportunistic. The sepa-
ration of church and state was an ideal
that the nation was founded on, and
the assertion that Clinton should be

impeached purely for his wanton

ways is ludicrous. .

Clinton should either resign or be
impeached. He should be impeached
for breaking an article of the
Constitution, not a moral subjective of
the Bible. ,

Clinton is not above the law —- he
should be punished. He may not be
above the Bible, but he still should not
be punished in a secular institution for
breaking a Commandment.

Call me paranoid; Technology scares me —
I admit it. I’ mnot talking about television suck-
ing my brain away or aliens speaking to me
through the radio. I’m not thinking about vio-
lence on television and the eifects some people
believe it has on children. There are well—docu-
mented ways that today’s technology invades
our privacy. Laugh at my paranoia if you will,
but if everyone knew exactly what was going on
out there, I bet all of you would be paranoid, too.

It’s becoming more difﬁcult, if not irnpossi-
ble, to use a computer on campus without using
the Windows NT program. When I’m forced to
use one of the computers with this program, I
cringe and wonder what computer whiz is track-
ing my keystrokes, ready to steal my password
and e-mail death threats to the president (not that

he doesn’t have more important things to worry ‘

about right now). .

You’re not safe at the supermarket, either.
Buying groceries may be cheaper with a store’s
discount card, but the store can then keep
records of what people buy when
the card is used. These records can

feel the need to “check up” on their
policyholders, making sure those

who claim to be super-healthy nonsmokers and -

dieters .aren’t buying Lucky Strikes and

Using e-mail programs at work can be a
wicked nightmare, especially if the program is
provided by the employer. Courts have ruled
that employers who provideie-mail programs to
employees can access any message sent over
the program This creates new reasons for talk-
ing behind the boss’ back (but pausing before e-
mailing those thoughts to a ﬁiend).

‘Net surfers beware! The Intemet is the
worst place to frequent if you’re worried about

privacy. I’m -not sure the idea of privacy»

occurred to those who created the Internet.
Microsoft, as reported in Mother Jones maga-
zine, has created Internet sites and software that
are equipped to retrieve ﬁles ﬁ'om the users’
hard drives without their knowledge, record the
other sites the users have visited in the same ses-
sion if using Microsoft Internet Explorer, and
keep records of the users’ personal information.
Users don’t even have the choice to click or not
to click on “Agree” in that little gray box that
popsuponthescreenwhenaccessingcertain

to |islhje:i—techno|ogy really worth it?

sites. Simply by accessing the Microsoft site,

  

users agrees to all of these terms — usually
without knowing exactly what the terms are.

. I know I sound more paranoid than a die-
hard X-phile, but this lack of privacy scares me.
It’s creepy thinking about my name, phone
number, and street and e-mail addresses being
sold to the highest bidder. Who would buy it?
Lots of companies, I’m sure. Companies that
wanttodirectlyappealtousersofspeciﬁc
Intemet sites. Companies that want to expand

- their customer base the cheapest and easiest way

possible.

But what happens ifI surf the ‘Net looking
for information on child pornography for a
research paper, without knowing that my move-
ments on the ‘Net are being tracked and that
eventually a record of this will be sold to the
FBI? Thanks for the oﬂer, but I’d rather not have
my own personal ﬁle at FBI headquarters, espe-
ciallyifthatﬁlemakes melooklikeacriminal.
New forms of technology are always
regarded in terms of how they bene-
ﬁt our lives. Critics of the media
note that hardly anyone ever spends
time thinking about what new tech-
nologies take away ﬁom us. The
ability to sit at a computer at Pitt and access
information on absolutely anything in the world
is amazing to me. Using faster, more advanced
computer software saves time and allows more
people to use computers.

And any student would sing the praise of
getting good deals at the supemiarket But is all
of this worth the price we pay? I don’t want any-
one to know what I buy at Giant Eagle or what
Internet sites I drop into late at night Not_
because I’m eating nothing but Pixie Stix and
surﬁng the most disgusting sites I can ﬁnd, for
neither of these are the truth. Some things just
aren’t anyone’s business but my own, Isay.

So cut up your supermarket discount card!
Pay for your own e-mail service! Stay the hell
away from the Internet, or at least the evil
Microsoft sites! When oompames stop getting
information about our lives so easily, they’ll

realizethatwebelievetheservicestheywishto .

offer us aren’t worth sacriﬁcing our private lives

‘for. And they really aren’t.

About two weeks ago, my roommate
and I made the trip to Three Rivers
Stadium to watch the Chicago Cubs tangle
with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The star attrac-
tion of the evening, Cubs outﬁelder
Sammy Sosa, clobbered his 57th home run
in the ﬁrst inning to a standing ovation
from the predominately blue-collar crowd.
Some 36,000 had come that night to see
one of the great players in the game today.
They were treated to an exciting, well-
played game.

As we sat in the bleachers, my room-
mate and I began to reﬂect on the costs we
paid to see this game. The ticket for poor
outﬁeld seats was $8. Our food was slight-
ly more expensive than $8. (We made the
mistake of not eating before we came to the
ballpark.) The total cost was a little more
than $16 for each of us. Not too bad, but a
little high for college students scraping
together tuition. What about the cost for
others? '

According , to U.S. News & World
Report, when you add in all of the costs
associated with going to a sporting event
—,— the price of tickets for a family of four,
the parking fees, the gas money, the cost of

food — an evening at the old ballpark
comes out to be $114.82, a cost prohibi-
tively expensive for middle- and lower-
class families. Want to see an NHL game?
You’ll have to fork over $228.39 per game.
Which poses a question: Who can
alford to attend sporting events anymore?

As a hockey nut, I regularly attend _

Penguin games, but‘I do so only because I
can receive hefty student discounts. I rarely
attend games at my home near
Philadelphia because the costs are so high.
Few, save the wealthiest of Americans,
have the disposable income to see their
favorite teams on anything but television.
Yet cities continue to build stadiums
for teams. There are few places in pro foot-
ball where fan loyalty means as much as it
does in Cleveland, formerly the home of
the ‘Browns, and home of the most rabid
and committed fans in the NFL. Yet three

years ago, the citizens of Cleveland awoke

to hear that their decades of suffering
through mediocre seasons and devastating
playoﬁ losses were all for naught. Art
Modell, the owner of the Browns, saw ﬁt to

pack his team up, move to Baltimore, and

end the storied rivalry between the Browns

, and the Steelers. Why did he do it? Because

the Browns had become unproﬁtable?
Hardly. He did it simply because he got a

better offer from the city of Baltimore to
move his team to a plush, $224 million sta-
dium ﬁnanced by the tax dollars of the cit-
izens of Maryland,

In recent years, the story of the Browns
has become a familiar one to sports fans
across America. Ever since the construc-
tion of the retro—chic Camden Yards in
Baltimore, lobbyists for every baseball
franchise have attempted to blackmail their

' state legislatures into building the owners

of their team an ego-satisfying stadium.
Each owner has to have a stadium with
cool knickknacks like retractable domes,
swimming pools and more luxury boxes.
The principal argument advanced by
stadium funding advocates is that the rev-

enues generated from the construction of 0

these facilities offset their costs. Right. If
‘anyone seriously believes that, I would like
to offer him or her the opportrmity to pur-
chase choice real estate down in Florida
right now.

The idea that stadiums bring anykind
of revenue to replace the money spent on
constructing them is ridiculous. If teams
want new stadiums to play in, I say let them
pony up the cost of building them. Don’t
ask poor and middle-class, Americans to
foot the bill for the sake of egocentric own-
ers. —

In Iclxes!

The 1997 debate over whether to give
the Steelers and the Pirates two new stadi-
ums utterly baﬂled me. Was Three Rivers
Stadium falling apart? Certainly not. The
city and the teams merely wanted to keep
up with their competitors in Baltimore and
elsewhere in the battle to build cooler and
newer stadiums. The sole‘ argument for
funding the stadiums seemed to be that
everyone else has a new stadium, so why
not us? Unfortrmately, though the stadium
sales tax was soundly thrashed at the polls
by voters fed up with millionaires pleading
poverty, it‘ appears the county commission-

gersaregoingtodipintothetreasuryand

build ﬂie new stadiums. Guess who will
have to pay this bill.

The costs of attending sports games
are so outrageous that one of my grandpar-
ents recenﬂy suggested to me the idea of
forcing sports franchises to earmark a set
number of season passes to lower-income
fans as a contingency for funding new
sports stadiums. I think it is a good idea. If
they are going to spend our tax dollars to
build these darned things, why not give us
an opportunity to actually see the ﬁuits of
our hard-eamed sacriﬁce? 1

a Thank you, Pitt
fans for a great
a weekend

, Hey, Pittsburgh Panther fans!
THANK YOU! .
Thank you for making’ Saturday

one of the best days in Pitt. football
history. Thank you for loving your

- Panthers and sticking with them.

Thank you for hating Penn State and
letting them know it. Thank you for
everything you did this weekend for
Pitt sports. . I

I am the sports editor of The Pitt
News, but first and foremost I am’ a
Pitt fan, so on Saturday I shunned the

’press box and sat in 12th Man

Territory, and I loved every minute of
it. -

The atmosphere coming into the
game was excellent. There were tail-
gaters everywhere. They were grilling
in parking lots, in front yards and in
the middle of the street, but the real
excitement was inside Pitt Stadium
when the Panthers took the field.

Before the Panthers’ entrance,
there were some small groups of Penn
State fans trying to show their Lion

"pride in the Pitt student section, but

the'Pitt students would have none of
it.

The Staters used their infamous
“We are  Penn State” cheer, and the
Pitt fans countered the “Penn .State”
by yelling “assholes,” or followed the
cheer with “Sucks.” '

Pitt fans made it clear the
Panthers were the home team, which
hasn’t happened in the past. Last
year, against Notre Dame, there could
have been confusion about the home
team unless a fan lookedto see whose
name was written in the end ‘zone.

"Saturday, the Panther fans came
to make some noise and to show that,
as the signs said, “.We Believe.” The
fans and the Panther players were the
only people in the world who thought
the Panthers had a chance against
their intrastate rivals, the bigger,
stronger, faster Nittany Lions.

' When the Panthers came out to
the roar of the crowd, it was impossi-
ble to hear the Pitt band play, the fight
song over the blare of crowd noise.

In the first three minutes of the
game, the Panthers forced a Penn
State fumble, which sent the capacity
crowd into hysterics. e '

As the game wore on, the Lions
began to manhandle the Panthersand,
the crowd became more and more
laid-back, but at critical moments of

Panther quarterback Matt Lytle started
Saturday’s game with a picture-perfect
screen pass to wide-open Brandon
Williams. e

The play went for 24 yards and gave
Pitt a ﬁrst down, its ﬁrst of the game. ‘

One play later, Lytle came back to real-
ity. Running a quarterback draw, the Pitt
senior ducked forward into oncoming Penn
State attackers, eluding one Nittany Lion
before being driven into the turf by LaVar
Arrington for a 1-yard loss. - ' .

And to quote your local radio disc jock-
ey, the hits just kept on coming.

A The Penn State defense sacked Lytle
eight times in Saturday’s 20-13 Pitt loss,
with Anington tallying half of the sacks per-
sonally.

Lytle said that to deal with the beating,
he attempted to look at the hits the same way
Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre does ——
“After every hit, he just smiles,” said Lytle.

“But after a while, I couldn’t. .I just lost
focus.”

Lytle ﬁnished the game with 12 com-
pletions on 24 attempts, throwing, for 144
yards and with two interceptions. He

received hard hits on every sack, took shots '

The Pitt vs. PSU rivalry is far from dead

Geoff Moak

Staff Wrlter

If there were any doubt about the
state of the Pitt-Penn State rivalry,
Saturday’s game should have erased it.

Nobody needed _to say anything
about therivalry. The especially dejected
looks on the faces of the Pitt players at
the postgame press conference said
enough. This really was no ordinary loss.

There would have been plenty of
reason to let it be an ordinary loss. Down
20-6 with 6:27 left in the fourth quarter,
the Panthers took possession on their
own l5—yard'line. The lack of point pro-
duction to that point gave little reason for
the Panthers to think they still had a
chance of winning.

Well, maybe one reason. »

“You can't deny [Pitt’s] ﬁghtin
spirit,” said Pitt head coach Walt Harris.

VV1th that spirit, the Panther oﬁense
took the ﬁeld and did its best to get the
85 yards needed to putthe team back in
the game. The three nmning backs kept
pounding the ball at the Nittany Lion

defense. The receivers got open, and
when they couldn’t hold on to the ball,
they did their best to draw two important
penalties on Penn State’s defensive
backs. Quarterback Matt Lytle, who
spent most of the afternoon taking a
beating at the hands of Penn State’s
defensive front seven, voluntarily took
one more hit at the end of the drive, div-
ing through a small hole into the end
zone. _
That touchdown brought the crowd
back into the game, a fact not lost on

I Harris, and it brought life into the

defense as well. . T
The Panther defense had appeared to
be getting tired as~the fourth quarter wore
on. But for three ‘plays after the kickoﬁ,
Pitt’s defense, the same group that sur-
rendered 40 yards in the fourth quarter to
Penn State backup running back Omar

: Easy, was unrelenting. The newly ener-

gized Pitt defense forced Penn State to
punt the ball back to the Panthers with
1:38 to play, leaving theoutcome of the
game very much in doubt after all.

“I think we had a high level of inten-



sity because that’s the way we are.‘  I

expect us to play with that kind of inten- I

sity all the time.” Harris said after the
game.

That may be, but the crowd certain-
ly had extra intensity because ‘it was
Penn State on the other sideline. And you
can bet that there was a very good reason
that Harris chose this particular game to
show off his program to recruits.

Feelings are lessclear on the other
side of this rivalry. Penn State played
like it didn’t care much, about this game.
But what matters now is next year. The
Nittany Lions will be ready to play the
Panthers on Sept. 11, 1999. They certain-
ly won’t want to play another game as
poorly as they played this one.

The reason is that this still is a rival-
ry. If you still have "any doubt, listen to
Lytle, who walked into the postgame
press conference and declared that “a
loss hurts even more playing Penn
State.”

Reports of the death of the Pitt-Penn
State rivalry have been greatly exagger-
ated.

Around 8 am. Saturday, the smells of
hamburgers, hot dogs, beer and charcoal
ﬁlled the air in South Oakland. But believe
it or not,’ the pregame celebration started
much earlier. »

Even as early as Tuesday night, all the
popular Oakland’ bars were as crowded as
they are on a typical Saturday. It was “Penn

A biggest Pitt football game in a decade got

everyone riled up.
As the week wore on and kickoﬂ’ drew
closer, the celebration intensiﬁed. On every-

the excitement reached a near—fever pitch. .
Finding a place to stand in C.J

weekend. It looked
like a block party
on Meyran and
Oakland Avenues
on Friday night.
Hordes of rowdy 
Pitt fans wandered ’
the streets into the
wee hours of the
morning, and Pitt
faithful hung ban-
ners out their win-
dows and off their
porches.

One proudly
proclaimed, “F-ck
You, PSU!” and another took 'a page out of
the world of professional wrestling, saying,
“Penn State, we got two words for you:
Suck It!” ' .

Vtrrth the Saturday moming sun came

 . bands and bands of tailgaters. Every con-

ceivable place to park in Oaldand was occu-

 . pied, and the thoughts of football and food‘

were on everyone’s mind . _

. The tailgate parties spread out across
the parking lots looked like the board ﬁom a
game of Risk Most camps ﬂew a Pitt ﬂag,
but some ﬂew the ﬂag of the enemy.

“We’re celebrating Penn State football,

- not the rivalry,” explained Michelle Hughes,

a Penn State tailgater who ﬂew the blue and
white of the Nittany Lions. “It’s not much of
a rivalry since we kick your ass every year.”

On top of Cardiac Hill, the scene was

  

just as alive. On the lawn near Pennsylvania
Hall and Pitt Stadium, more tailgaters
sprawled out on the grass. They enjoyed
burgers, barbecued ribs and, of course, beer.

In front of Sutherland Hall, mobs of
rowdy students gobbled up the free live
music and food before_tlrey entered the sta-
dium.’ _

At this point, the energy was so intense
and team pride from both schools so high
that there were a bunch of less-than-friendly
shouting matches between fans.

' The gates entering “12th Man

ate away at the patience of many Pitt fans.

Pitt’s women’s soccer team overcame
Vllanova, 1-0, Friday in a game that could
easily claim its place in ‘the history of this
young team -

It was the Lady Panthers’ fourth win this
year, and though the season is still only three
weeks old, they have already beaten their
best season record ever. ,

Their best had been last season’s 3-12-
3; now, after a 3-2 win over Rutgers Sunday,
they already are at 5-2-0 overall in their third
season.

The icing on the cake came before the
games. After the two wins last week (l1—l
over Wagner and 4-3 against St. John’s, both
away), sophomore forward Charity

The _defense had no choice, "as"

the Nittany Lions abandoned the air
attack and attempted to ram the ball
down Pitt’s throat for much of the
fourth quarter. With less than 10

‘minutes remaining. in'the game, the

PSU running attack faltered, as
backup running back Omar Easy
managed only 6 yards on two con-
secutive carries.

That brought third down, and
the Lions ‘attempted a rare pass. Pitt
defensive end‘ Pete Simonian chased
dow.n PSU_ quarterback e Kevin
Thompson, forcing _ him out of
bounds for a 2-yard loss and forcing
the Nittany Lions to punt. _

from fullback Rickey

by Lytle. On first down from the Pitt
45, Lytle threw an incomplete pass
intended for Latef Grim, but a pass-
interference penalty brought the ball
to th'e"Penn State 40.

Another Lytle run (this one an‘

unplanned scramble) moved the ball
to the 16, and a Kevan Barlow run
combined with a 12-yard pass-inter-
ference penalty gave Pitt as fi1‘st-and-
goal at the PSU 2. .

Again came the ‘option. Well,
sort of. ,

Lytle never _looked at the two
running backs behind him, tunneling
underneath a ‘pile of Pitt and Penn
State linemen into the end zone to
make the score 20-12.

‘(Despite all.the rushing, Lytle
insisted after the game that he was
“not anoption quarterback.” He fin-
ished the game with minus—13 yards

on the ground but would have

ranked near the top of the Pitt rush-

ing list had he not been sacked eight A

times and lost 53iyards in the
process.)

threw a toss that was deﬂected just
in front of Pitt safety Seth Hornack

dove for the ball and caught it on a‘

hop, then picked it up and began

- jumping around in front of the refer-

ee in hopes of a favorable call.

The tactic didn’t work, but nei-
ther did Penn State’s‘ third-down run
play, as Purifoy leveled Mitchell for
a 6—yard loss.

The PSU punt sailed to the Pitt
43, but the Nittany Lion pass rush
found Lytle three straight times, set-
ting up the failed Ketchen pass and
_ending the contest.

Lytle took the blame for the last
series, saying that he “didn’t exe-
cute the way I should have.

“You just-can’t make mistakes ‘

against a team like Penn State.”

Cnowo

supporters started with their signature “We
Are  "Penn State” chant before it was
utterly drowned out by a much louder
“Penn State Sucks” chant from Pitt fans.

The mere sight inside the stadium
juiced up Pitt fans even further. The stadi-
um was completely sold out and packed to _
capacity. ' .

Fans ﬁlled ‘every inch of the bleach-
ers, but that wasn’t enough. People over-
ﬂowed into the aisles, and most fans stood
for the entire game.

But the game was ﬁlled with so much
emotion that fans didn’t mind standing. In
fact, they would have stood no matter how
much seating was available. I

The students in the stands were just as
much a part of the game as the students on
the ﬁeld. The Pitt players obviously
thrived on the energy spewed forth by the
crowd that was obviously heavily Pitt.

During the game, the deafening roar
of fans bolstered the Panther defense and
disrupted the Penn State offense. The
vocal explosion that came with Matt
Lytle’s fourth-quarter touchdown run
rivaled that of any college stadium \

The arrogant “Shit on Pitt” and
“We’ll kick your ass” chants of Penn State
fans were silenced as the game wore on
and our band of less talented, bigger—heart-
ed players competed right with the over-
conﬁdent Nittany Lions. . -

After the game, as the heartbroken
Panther fans walked down Cardiac Hill,
another chant rose from the masses. .

“Overrated!”

the game, the Twelfth Man let the
Pitt team know that they were in the
stadium to support the Panthers.

The Pitt offense could not get
going during most of the game, but
the Pitt defense played with more
heart than any defense has since I
have been at Pitt.

Every third down, the students
got cranked up and made it hard for
the Nittany Lion signal—callers to
call their plays. The Panthers played
with more energy behind them than
they have at any time in recent histo-
ry.

The defense fed off the emotion
of the fans and stopped the Lions
series after series. _ The Panther
defense, whichshad to be exhausted,

FROM PAGE 10

came out every play and played with ‘

heart and determination, which is
what coach Walt Harris’ teams
always exhibit.

Even though the offense could
not get going, the fans let the players
hear cheers, not boos, on every
series. The fans fed off the energy
and the “never say die” attitude of
the defense to give the offense some
much-needed support.

As the game came to a close, the
Panthers, who had been physically
beaten up all day, came out and put
together a touchdown drive capped
off by quarterback Matt Lytle, who
exhibited more heart and less quit
than anyone on the field after being
sacked eight times and hit on almost
every passing play.

The Panthers came out after the
touchdown, and Harris had enough
confidence in his defense that he
went ahead and kicked the ball away
with three minutes to play.

The Panther faithful were
pumped up, and some could actually
feel the old concrete Pitt Stadium
rumble beneath them. The exhausted
defense came out fired up and
stopped the Lions on three plays,
forcing them to punt.

The Panther offense could not
capitalize, but the fans did not care,
as they cheered their team and
showed they had “Panther Pride.”

That is an idea that has been
dead around here for years.

All of you fans may not realize
it, but you have inﬂuenced Pitt foot-
ball’s future. If somewhere there was
a blue-chip recruit watching and he
was trying to decide between Pitt
and Penn State, you very well could
have swayed his decision to the
Panthers. You have ensured the
future of Pitt football.

Please keep up the support and
let the Panthers know what a great
team they are every time you see
them. We scared Penn State fans
Saturday. All of them who said the
rivalry was dead are wrong. They

will not want to come to Pittsburgh
in 2000. They will not want to face
the pesky Panthers.

The gap is closing, and the
Panthers keep moving up the ladder.
Look out world, here we come.

Thank you as a Panther fan
because I see a lot of bright days
ahead, due in large part to those
pesky, stubborn, relentless
Pittsburgh Panther fans!

HAIL TO PITT!

Patrick Robertson is the sports edi-
tor of The Pitt News and can ’t wait
for JoePa and his depleted Penn Sate
team to limp into Oakland: from
Crappy Valley in two years and get
beaten by the Panthers, as Pitt
proves that there is no longer a gap
between Pitt and Penn State football.
