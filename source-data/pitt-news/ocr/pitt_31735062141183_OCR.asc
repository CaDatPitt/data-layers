ments, C43, and the YW social
committee. '

All women are invited to attend
this fashion clinic, which is the
second of a series of personality
development programs sponsored
by WAA and the YWCA. The
theme of the third clinic, schedul-
ed for early in November, will be
“It’s Smart to be Thrifty.”

’Ho|d That La...’ *
Will Be Theme
For Style Show

Since it costs 30 cents to sit in
the balcony to see “Dive Bombers”
that don’t divebomb and 35 cents
to see a little glass of Johnny
Walker walk across the mahogany,
it isn't often you get anything for
nothing now.

Bu’: tea dancing after the Pitt
_News_ style show is free because
it doesn't cost anything to get
into the showl that starts before
the dancing.

Latest N. Y. Creations

Some-people would think the
dancing would be enough, but
when the Pitt News does anything
it does it right. We are throw-
ing in ' (with a magnanimous
gesture, we admit) a chance to
take a look at a bevy of campus
gals in the latest creation from
New York, for sports, for campus
wear, and for an evening of gadd-
ing‘ about.

Men will model too, at the af-
fair which is to take place on
Wednesday, October 29, at 3:30

o'clock in the ballroom of the
Schenley hotel.

Fittings at Rosenbaums

“Hold That Line”! is the theme
of the show, and is carried out
by the different background sets.

Fittings for the clothes to be
worn by both men and women will

  For Freshmen

WAA will formally greet new
‘women students tonight at the Bal
Mystique, which will take place at
the Hotel Schenley from 7:15 to
9:30 o‘clock.

Novel dancing, led by Car1‘Hein-
rich, dance instructor, and women
chosen, from among the guests,
will be the main feature of the
program. Most of the entertain-
ment is being kept secret, but
prizes will be awarded to the
freshman women exhibiting the
most original, home-made crepe-
paper hats.

The awards will be given by a
committee of ﬁve women mem-
bers of the faculty and will be
based on originality displayed in
designing the hats to follow one
of three themes: tuck shops, li.
braries, or nationality rooms.

Bal Mystique, sponsored annu-«

man and transfer women with the
organization, is ‘under the direc-

. . . first meeting of i

new University Senate

OI‘

Permanent Senate Takes
Place of Former Council

By AL MAVRINAC _

Almost two years of work by a temporary University
Council will come to an end Friday, October 31 when the
first meeting of the University Senate is called to order
in the office of Chancellor John G. Bowman.

The constitution of the new Senate, intended to be an
advisory body to the members of the administration and
to serve as a link between the members of the faculty and officers
of the University, was approved by the members of the Board of
Trustees last June. ‘

Invitations already have been sent out by Provost _Rufus H. Fitz-
gerald, to approximately 140 members of the administration and mem-
bers of the faculty, who will comprise the new assembly.

Included in the call are all the deans of the various schools; the
dean of men and the dean of women; all the resident full-time pro-
fessors and associate professors; the registrar of the University; the
librarian; the bursar; and the director of the Extension division and if
of the Summer sessions and Evening classes. —

Also included are-the directors of Men's and of the Women’!
Student Health service, and the director of athletics.

The temporary council, which has now passed out of existence to
give place to the new Senate, was set up by the members of the
Board of Trustees at a meeting of the board on February 6,1940.

As outlined in the order creating the temporary council, the pur- 1
pose of the permanent Senate is to act as “representatives of the
faculty,” at meetings with members of the University administra-L
tion.

In addition, the members of the new body are to meet with the »  .
officers of the University to express “the faculty’s advice on educa-
tional policies and to receive information from the administration 7 T
concerning” the University’s current affairs.

However, the origin and history of the Senate extends much

For the second time in the history of the Uni-

life. ’

It is difficult to estimate how much this war
will influence activities at Pitt, but it is interest-
ing to look back at the changes brought about by
World War 1.

A reference to the Pitt Weekly ﬁles of 1917-
18 shows that women came to the front to ﬁll
the shoes of college men in Uncle Sam's service.

' Prior to 1917 a. woman would not have considered

entering a. professional school, but when the men
were taken by the army, brave damsels stepped
forth and took their chances. There was also a
‘large increase in the number of women enrolled
in Pitt evening school.
And still ‘women remained active on campus.

“and since there are no frontiers to

Mosque Energy

Last E1-iday night an energetic
fudience ﬁlled the Mosque. The
occasion was an opera, and Pitts-
lurghers rarely have the opportu-
Jiity to see an opera. So they
‘filled the three thousand or so
beats early, and were very polite
iwhen the second-rate orchestra
played the overture. They were
livery polite when the second-rate

And they were still polite when

“Don Pasquale” that» came to
Pittsburgh was anything but live-
ly. lt looked and sounded as if

it needed a good week's rest.

And since I’ve been almost
wholly destructive to this point,
I’ll make a constructive point or
two. This summer at the school
I went topa group of students got
together, and decided they wanted
to produce an opera.

Only one girl in the whole
school had ever studied voice, but
that didn't stop us. None of us»
could sing a penny’s worth, but
we wanted to have some fun. So

we selected “Carmen” to do, but

all the boys wanted to be The
Toreador so we settled for some-
thing more within our range,
“The Beggar’: Opera.” It was
more of a rowdy musical comedy
than an opera, but anyway we
could sing our lungs out and have
a ﬁne time.

Now there must be hundreds of
people in Pittsburgh who have
good voices and like to sing. Why
not, then, a civic opera company?
’The‘ voices may be bad and the
paste-board stairs may fall on top
of Carmen, but if there’: enthus-
iasm and sincerity and intelli-
gence behind the performance,
the audience will enjoy it. How
much better it will be, in any
case, than having to hear a sec-
ond or third rate company im-
ported from New York at sky-
high prices.

Art Enriches

All this leads to the ﬁnal point.
Art is an enrichment of life. You
cannot thoroughly enjoy a work
of art unless you, in your own
amateurish and clumsy way, have
worked in it. Anyone who’s tak-
en only two lessons in water-col-
ors can appreciate a really good
water-color much more than some-
one who’s taken no lessons at all.

‘Can Axis Victory Mean

Restriction of

By MARTIN LunovsKv~ ,, .

If the decision is made to send
the cream of our youth to wage
war against the. Axis, either in
Europe or in Asia, it will have

been reached only partly because

of our detestation for the per-
secution of religion in German
occupied. Europe, or the unwar-
ranted invasion of peaceful coun-.
tries from the standpoint of bru-
tality to the populace, by the ter-
rible three, or because a ship of
ours is torpedoed. J

The Plain Truth

The plain unemotional truth
is that American markets and
sources of ‘raw materials have
fallen and threaten to fall to an
even greater extent into the
eager hands of Hitler and This
Mediterannean and Far Eastern
cohorts, andiwe aren’l: -going‘ to
stand for it.

I _ i

To tell an American boy that
we‘ are going to fight to main-
tain these markets and materials
is hardly enough to make him
give up his job, kiss his sweet-
heart good—by, and voluntarily of-
fer to risk his life. Yet the com-
plete lossgof these materials would
have a tremendously disasterous
effect on our living standard and
could very . possibly result in a
totalitarian government here.
X-9 Reporting

The Axis plan after victory
seems clear. They are going to
impose the old English mer-
cantile system in their respegtive
spheres by forcing the conquered
P901112; to serve as va als ti ex-

 

Materials?

many, Italy, and Jappn. .Tho i

materials will be utilized by the
master races for self-consumma-A
tion-and for manufacture and no-_
sale to the miserable slaves gs‘
astronomical prices.

To compete with this slave
labor would lower our living stamp ,
dard.‘ That standard will also end-
fer by the failure ‘to obtain ma-
terials, which will close many
factories and force us“ db with-
out a great number of things
which have made our. daily lives
more pleasant and more con-
venient. The numerous materials
from every corner“ of the globe
needed for the telephone is but
one example. *

The inability to find 5 market
for our goods would add ta 3].,
crisis and it is very likely’ that
complete government, control by
the iron hand of an authoritarian
favorable to Hitler would result.

Course of Action

Our course of action must lie-
gin with the defeat of the Axis
in whatever way appears wisest.
However to let it rest, at that
would not only invite but assure
continued frequent conflicts. it
is our solemn‘ duty after victory
to devise some means -of giving

Reviicw

Francescatii Plays a
me Violin Concert

By I. CROSSMAN

When Zino Francescatti apear-
ed with the Pittsburgh Symphony
last year, local music “critics and
reviewers rushed to their typewrit-
ers and pounded praisesiacclaim-
ing him as one of the greatest vio-
linists of our day. When Zino
Francescatti performed for Pitts-
burg‘h’s concert—g‘oers again last
Saturday evening and Sunday aft-
ernoon, this reviewer joined the
'_others in the dash to the typewrit-
ers again to hail Francescatti as
“some violinist!”

Accompanied by Dr. Fritz Rei-
mer and the Pittsburgh Symphony
orchestra, slender, sleek-haired
Francescatti played Edouard La-
lo's “Symphonic Espagnole” to a
complimentary audience who
stung their‘ hands applauding for
encores, especially we boys in the
second balcony. _

Francescatti performs on his
violin with almost matchless tech-
nique and emotion. In this bril-
liant concerto, Francescatti shows
 enthusiasm and technique for
lively compositons. It is said that
I-Ieifetz, considered about the top
violinist of today, lacks the en-
fllhusiasm and emotion of Frances-
eatti-——whereas Heifetz is more
technically perfect, but too me-
chanically perfect.

The artist, Francescatti proves
his _talen:t,fo»r the violin by his in-
terpretation of the concerto. The
first two movements were rather
slow to grasp, but‘the proceeding
two movements grew upon the

listener with increasing momen-
tum until Francescatti brilliantly
ended the concerto.

For his encores, Francescatti
played a short‘Paganini piece and
a fantasia interpretation of “Amer-
ica." In the last encore Frances-
catti proved that he was a real
virtuoso by playing a slow broad
melody. When Francescatti play-
ed a Paganini concerto, brilliant
and lively, at his last appearance,
opinion had it that he could not do
as well on a broad melody. But

“America.” In this number he
performed the unusual trick of

note at the same moment. The
effect is beautiful.

When this feat was performed,

out any restraint exclaimed,
“Whewl" So did we boys in the

After the concert, the boys be-

merits of the complete program.

“He's good," said one of the
boys, but there’s one fault he
should get rid of." «

“What's that?” we asked.

“He moves about too much

TOMMY DORSEY (Victorl

This arrangement of HALLE-

LUJAH by T.D. is just about the
last word in Dorseyocracy. Rec-
ord features the piano work of Joe
Bushkin and trumpet of Ziggy El-

man, not to mention the spine-

tingling tone of Tommy’s trom-
bone: B side has Sinatra's ‘vocal-
ization of PALE MOON. Frank

By the way, be sure to get arrear-
ful of Dorsey’s latest album re-
lease.

SAMMY KAYE (Victor) " ~
Sammy can thank the Pall Mall
advertising staff for his latest hit
recording. The name, you guess-
ed it. is MODERN DESIGN.
Complete with sound effects, this
number is sure to meet with the
approval of Kaye fans and oth-
ers. It is not a dance tune but
is deﬁnitely for listening andf“au-
dience participation." Probably
the first words youill say when
you hear it is quote, isn’t that
a cute song, unquote. Reverse
side has WHEN W I N T E R
COMES. We can’t wait.

RAYMOND SCOTT (Columbia)
Scott fans will go big for his
two latest numbers, namely, KEY
WEST and ON THE JERSEY
SIDE. This disc combines odd
and novel chords to make for a
real wacky Scott disc. You might

cords for Okeh, is already lead-
ing the field in novelty tune and
swing‘ classics such as his arrange-

one of the Pitt dances.

 Cleven Sees

Discussing the deeper signiﬁ-

America, Dr. N. A. N. Cleven, pro-
fessor of history, told the Women’s
‘ ‘club of Verona that inter-Ameri-
can relations are at the cross-
‘ roads.

A ministration is a sinister program
of intervention in the domestic
affairs of our southern neighbors,
declared Dr. Cleven.

“Although this policy is not new
but being camouﬂaged by good
. neighborliness, we have had evi-
udences of the effectiveness of it.
0. The attempted change of presi-
dents in Panama, the seizure or air-
«—,..planes on the way to Peru, and
V the trade agreement with Argen-
it ,., tina areconcrete examples of-what
;,]_i_s taking place below our border."
 ,. At no time in history, not even
 inthe heyday of imperialistic age,

has our government pursued such

3 an interventionist policy, accord-

. ing to Dr. Cleven, but every ‘gov-

: gernment must be acceptable to us.

A 4 The fact that it took such a long

"time to announce the results of

the recent presidential election in‘

?Mexico was cited as evidence of

3 the power that our national gov-

vernment is exercising in that coun-
1 try. — .

 ‘ Concluding, Dr. Cleven said,

in informal conversations among faculty members and with Uni-
versity officers, that the Board of Trustees was asked to approve
.the formation of a temporary council, in which a feasible plan could
be tested from which a permanent body could be arranged.

After the council had been set up, with Mr. Fitzgerald as chair-
man and Dr. Samuel P. Franklin as secretary and consisting of about
65 other members, ﬁve committees were created within the frame-
work of the council.

One committee, headed by Dr. William '1‘. Root, dean of the grad-
uate school, and professor and head of the department of psychology,
studied the functions of councils of faculty and administrative mem-
bers at such universities as Michigan, Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
and Ohio State, and reported their ﬁndings to the whole council.

Other committees were set up to discuss the question of library
facilities, of registration, and a committee was set up for the sole
purpose of creating plans for a permanent body.

The work of the council, which began almost as soon as approval
had been received from the Trustees, was completed in eight meet-
ings.

Leading-“the assualt on the

Nihtany squad was Bruce Renter,
who personally accounted for
three of the Panther's. touch-
downs. .l_oe Adamchic scored the

other two touchdowns for the
Junglecats.
The game started off rather

slowly, and continued this way, un-
til midway in the opening quarter,
when the Panthers suddenly open-
ed up. From then on they were
never stopped and were a constant
threat up to the final gun. A
steady drizzle of rain was the only

sour note of the otherwise in-
teresting game.
The squad‘ was coached by

 In Line For Pitt Harriers

Coach Carl Olson’s cross-coun-
try squad runs up against stiff
opposition for the second time in
as many weeks on Saturday when
it journeys to Cleveland to com-
pete_in a four-way meet with Case,
Hiram and .Bethany. Running
will begin from Rockefeller field,
situated near Case, at one o’clock.

Little is known as to the opposi-
tion these teams will afford, the
Pittmen since they have yet to run
this season, but each has had ex-
cellent outﬁts in the past.

Shooting for his second tri-
umph of the young season, Bill
Curtis is being relied upon by
Olson to bear the brunt of the

i"or~~<]’anther attack. Curtis showed

hmazingly well against Michigan
jitate last Saturday and should

[‘w"‘“.prove to be one of the outstand-

ing trackmen in Pitt history.

Comprising the rest of the start-
ers will be Marcius Allias, Johnny
Brosky, Bob Davis, Jim Saunders
and two others chosen from Bob
Graham, Ben Foote, Bill Miller,
Joe Carr, and Bob Scott. Disap-
apointing in the light of their cap-
abilities is the work’ of Brosky,
Allias, and Davis, men who will
certainly improve as the season
progresses.

Inspiration and watching ‘the
heels of Curtis go ﬂying by will
perhaps snap these runners out of
their doldrums and.provide some
real competition between the team
members as well as the opposi-
tion. This would have a decided
eifect upon .‘:'uture.cross country
scores and would be a remedy for
coach 0lson’s‘ headache problem,
which is only starting but threat-

In War, Wealth, Vllinners

By ELAINE KAHN

In discussing Wallace Wade,
coach of the Duke Blue Devils it
is a good point to let his record
speak, for speak itdoes. During
his 22 years of coaching
football Wade has rung up the
impressive record of 1654 wins
against 35 losses and eight/ties.
During the ten years that he has
headed the coaching staﬁ at Duke,
Wade has guided his teams to 76
victories while" sustaining only
”7”$ defeats. That, to put it in the
.}>rnacular, is a record not to be
Kheezed at.

--5‘ Wade began his football career
pat Brown university where he
ifiplayed at guard for three years.

As a member of the Brown team

of 1916 Wade made his first

trip to the Rose Bowl which he

later invaded four times as the
coach of successful elevens.

joins Army

He celebrated his graduation
from Brown in 1917 by joining
the~army, and in August of that
year he was promoted to the rank
of captain.

Wadeientered the collegiate
coaching ranks in 1921 when he
went to ‘Vanderbilt as assistant
coach to Dan McGugin. In 1923
Alabama claimed him and ‘here
his coaching genius» began to tell.
Four times during his "stay at ‘Tus-
caloosa his teams won the cham-
pionship of the Southern * "con-

' ference —- and three times they

‘ went to the Rose Bowl.

A combination of added pres-
up plus salary resulted in Wade

severing his connection with
Alabama and reporting to Duke
where he doubles as coach and
athletic director. That was in
1931 and he has since managed
to guide this team to the South-
ern Conference title five times.
He has also managed to keep his
record of never having been bad-
ly beaten intact. The “worst”
defeats of his career were the
23-0 whipping Syracuse gave his
first Alabama team in 1923 and
‘ the 25-2 defeat Tennessee handed
his first Duke team in 1931.

Dukes vs. Panthers

Under Wade the Duke Blue
Devils have met the Panthers on
four occasions. In 1937. the
Panther win sent them on to the
Pasadena Classic and in 1938 the
Panther defeat helped to send the
Blue Devils to the»-Rose B.owl. The
1939 contest which was played
under the most miserable of

weather conditions brought about 

the charge" that Wade had delib-
erately 'emoved the canvas from

the field in order to slow up the
Panther attack. A

Marries Heiress

He probably made the best
play of his life when he married
the heiress to the American To-
bacco Co. It is aid
that as a result he is one of the
wealthiest men in the south and
could buy the entire Duke cam-
pus if he desired it.

Next to football, his favorite
sport is golf and during the off-
season he can be found on the
links practically everyday. Every-
day, that is, when he isn’t hunting

~ Satisfied rather than disap-
pointed was Olson’s reaction to
last Saturday's setback at the
hands of the Michigan State har-
riers. Coming from a team which
boasts of four ICAAAA cham-
pionships in the past six years is
no disgrace. Outstanding and
tough, so say the least, have been
these teams in the past. Pitt's
defeat coming from a team of
such caliber is a lesson in experi-
ence and one that should prove
all the more valuable as the sea-
son moves on.

Next Saturday an old Pitt riv-
alry is enlivened when the cross-
towners travel to State college
for their annual meeting with Penn
State. Experience from this week
and last should enable them to

_chalk up a triumph.

Freshmen
Scrimmage A

This Week

By PAUL CERCHIARA

Freshman football went into the
third week of practice yesterday
afternoon under the guidance’ of
coaches Nick, Kliskey and Ted
Konetsky. The fresh have reach-
ed the point in their practice ses-
sions where they will engage the’
varsity in scrimmage this week.

185 Pounds, 6iFeel-

A probable starter in the var-
sity—freshman scrimmage is Pat
West, of Burgettstown High, at
one of the end positions. West
scales 185 pounds and just makes
six feet.‘

Charles Suri-
na, who hails
. from Windber
High, may get
the call at the.
opposite termi-
nal. Chuck is
fast and stream-
lined , at 183
pounds, six feet
two inches.

Glenn McCur-

dy,' 192 pounds

KONETSKY and five feet

eight tall, who played for ‘Mas-

sanutten Academy before coming

to Pitt will probably be used at
one of the guards.

220 Pounds, 5 feet eleven

A tackle at’ McKeesport High,
Bruce Allen tips the weights at
220 pounds and reaches five feet
eleven. It looks like Allen will
get the assignment at one of the
tackles. A

Backfield men are ‘fast round-
ing into shape and show posibil-
ities of giving the team an of-
fensivn. punch to go along with
the line’: defensive strength.

Quarterback Pete Fuderich, a
fine kicker and runner,-1 will be
the one upon whom the others
will depend for leadership if he is
sent into the game. e Pete i-s only
ﬁve feet eight inches ‘tall and
scant 170 pounds, but his blocking
carries authority. .

Many others wil be used besides
the boys named, in fact, ac-
cording-to the coaches all mem-
bers of the freshman squad will
be used against the varsity so
that they may be, given a chance
to show their wares while under

hem Engineer Team, 

The lid came off of the intra-
mural football league last Friday
afternoon when the Oil & Gass-
ersdefeated the Chem E seniors,
7-0. The game was a nip and
tuck affair all the way. .The
petroleum boys ﬁnally crashed
through when Arnold dressed the
Chem E goal line. Grange add-

ed the extra point and the game '

was over as far as the scoring
was concerned.

Tomorrow the feature attrac-
tion finds the Phi Eps meeting the
winner of the Phi Gam-Pi Lam
contest. Regardlessof who wins
that game, the team that plays
the Phi Epsowill be in for a hot
afternoon. Finishing third last
season, the Neville street ‘seven
promises to be even stronger this
year.’ ~ —

\

_ Blood Battle

Arnold Biron,

all-intramural

star, Jay Silverberg, and Jimmy“

Deutelbaum are back to‘ offset
the loss of Wally Hirsch and
Alex Zelenski. If they play the
Phi Gams, the Phi Eps will be
up against the defending cham-
pions, who are again sporting a
strong team. But if the Pi"Lams
upset the Fijis, the game will dev-
elop into a blood battle between
these two arch rivals.

Another game that should be
of more thanpassing interest, will
be the one between the igma

Alpha Mu seven and the winner-

of the Phi Delt-Theta Chi encoun-
ter. The Sammies have lost only
Morris Mayer from last season’s

«

   

squad and have the nucleus for a
good, fast team. Danny Coltin, ’
“Hack” White, Harry Abramo-
vitz, “Red” Silverman, anduMel .,,
Frank» give them five experienced "
men, men who are accustomed to.’
the rough, tough brand of ball ‘
played by the Greeks.

The remaining games of the ff
,day finds the SAEs playing their
{winner of the Phi Kap-Sigma
Chi contest,’ and Lambda Chi tak-'
ing on the winner of the Delta
PiKA game.

Also Badminton F,  .
Badminton also occupies the
spotlight tomorrow as the Sam?
mies,. defending champs in this 
sport take on Theta Chi. The
Neville streeters lost one of their
ace “bird heaters” when “I-Ianlt”
Nemrod failed to return to school.
However, Norman Sapolsky is
back and “Hack” White will cap-. .
ably fill the departed Nemrod’s~.-
‘shoe’s. ;

The Phi l3.Ips and Pi Lams will
battle each other as will the Phi 5
Gams and Lambda Chi, the Delta"
and PiKA, and the Phi Kaps and
Sigma Chi, in the other badmin-
ton games of the day:

By MARTIN LUBOVSKY

Town I Meeting   

Two distinguished clergy-
men, one a Roman Catholic
priest, the other a Baptist

pastor, stood side by side be- ‘

forethe Pitt Town Meeting
last Monday and‘ discussed
the proper place of the United
States in the present conﬂict froln
two widely varying points of view.

Dispensing with the usual de-
livery of speeches, Dr. Bernard
C. Clausen, pastor of the First
Baptist church and Father
Charles Owen Rice, chaplain of
the American Catholic Trade
union stood side by side convers-
ing “tete-tete."

Dr. Clausen proposed that

“America keep out of the war and
‘by so doing, serve as an example

to an embittered, hate-ridden post-

; war Europe.

“I too am opposed to war, but
when you have a war you can’t

wish it out of existence. We have.

to take a deﬁnite stand,” answered’
Father Rice. In an intellectual,
Witty discussion the two men
traced the reasons for their con-
victions, conceding 'a point here,
refuting another one there.

Dr. Clausen ‘believed that a
world, free of recurring wars,
was possible. Father Rice thought
them inevitablefl Dr. Clausen
urged that we, adopt the Quaker
philosophy of helping‘ those in
need where we find them, and
dispensing with violence. Though
perhaps temporarily o v e r r u 11,

America will-be certain of event- _

ual redemption, according to him.
“I will live my life peacefully
and be an example in the at-
tempt,” he said.

But Father Rice predicted a
troubled world regardless of the
victor, adding that only by an
English triumph could a world
maintaining the decencies be
erected. Father Rice said he hates
Stalin as much as he did before
the invasion and is hoping that
Russia is defeated, but that Hitler
ruins himself in the process. .

AThe Catholic priest concurred
with his opponent's opinion that
this war will not end war, but
maintained that there were
things worth ﬁghting for, and
that such things, namely freedom
and decency, were at stake in
this clash.

Father Rice revealed that he has
received numerous letters from
persons opposed to his policy, con-
taining the bitt-erest animosity.
Dr. Clausen was willing to stack
his letters against Father Rice’s
in any contest of bitterness.
“Judas” was one of the milder
names he had been called.

.Failing~ in their avowed purpose
of altering each other’s views, the
two men succeeded in providing
an instructive, stimulating and
constantly bristling afternoon.
