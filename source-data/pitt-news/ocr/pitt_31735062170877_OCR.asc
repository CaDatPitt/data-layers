that the varying costs of the.dif-

Former ' Baseball Star

Bouton Reviews

by LARRY PANSINO

Jim Bouton. former star base-

troversial best—seller Ball Four,

book. baseball managers. other
sportscasters. and drugs in base-
ball. His humor reflected his en-
joyment oi the game and its char-
acters as wellas his low-ke_~. per-
spective on sports.

Bouton recalled that the origin-
al impetus for writing Ball Four
came from an incident at the end
of his first day of spring training
just after signing his first profes-
sional contract with the.New York
Yankees organization.

local lad_\ was entertaining the
team that evening.

“Since then and throughout my
career, I wondered why no one
had ever written a book about all
the amazingly funny people in
baseball. Finally, in 1969 a friend
suggested I keep notes on the
crazy incidents, and these notes
were the basisof the book.”

Two of the funniest characters
Bouton spoke of were Managers

“\'ou‘ve got to stretch. Yotrve got
to work at it." A class of three

stud_\ their own movements in a
large mirror. A record plat er is
discharging an eerie foreign
chant. The photographer whispers
in my ear. “All we need now is a

Dressed in ballet tights with a

She learned how to belly dance in

_ and intrigued by the folk dances

of Greece.

The presence of drugs in 'base—

pitcher “They‘re not as preva-

you could get greenies (ampheta-
mines) and sleeping pills from
the trainer. Now you can only get
sleeping pills. And a very small
percentage of the players smoke
marijuana occassionally."

After the publication of Ball
Four. much criticism from sports-
writers and baseball people de-
veloped concerning some of the
material Bouton used.

"I crossed many boundary lines
that the writers had established

to keep the pure images at ath-
letes intact and thus insure their
own security. Writers who cover a
particular beat for a long time de-
velop personal relationships with
many players and can't ‘remain as
objective and tough journalistical—

“He's (Kuhn) a nice man and
a hard worker. but he's not what
baseball needs." Bouton explain-
ed. "Baseball should have a com-
missioner who‘s bright. creative.
and dynamic."

Bouton resents being catagoriz—
ed with disgruntled former ath-
letes such as Dave Meggassey. He
said he loves baseball and misses
the fun of the game.

"I quit baseball because I didn't
want to be a marginal major

ence. and the Chinese program.
he said.

“Programming should compli-
ment the educational activities,”
said Moye, as he predicted in-
creased educationally - oriented
programs.

“We've had an active year in
the Student Activities area." he
said. "Our first year was a time
of evaluation. but this year has
been innovative."

An example oi this innovative’

programming. said Moye. is an
upcoming hockey game at the Al-
pine rink. II is an experimental at-
tempt to "take an activity to the
students." instead of having the
students come to the campus for
the activity. he said.

Experimentation is also being
planned in the area of housing,
with intensive study units in the
dorms under consideration, said
Moye. Pre-med and pre-dental
students, he said, are particularly
interested in this arrangement,
where study is of main concern.

"Study units. with faculty as-
sociates to interact with students.
could be set up with emphasis on
art and photography. or foreign
languages. or along academic.
lines. like engineering." said
Moye.

"I am pleased with how the
Campus Judicial System is work-
ing." he said. "Under the new
code. we have a model system
which guarantees due process and
a speedy and just hearing.”

Moye said he was now trying to
get funding for a Learning Skills
Center, which would be added to

the Counselling Center, to help
improve the study skills of those
with deficiences and inexperience.

"I am gratified that students
are beginning to show a greater
interest in activities." said Moye.
He stated that more students are
volunteering to work on on com-
mittees than ever before. and
cited the overwhelming vote in

support of the activities fee as 

proof of student interest.
“I probably smiled most broad-

ly when the Chancellor announced j 

that the Student Union building

was top priority on the new t'aciI-  , 
ities Iist,” said Moye. ‘_‘A new, r i ’

(Student Union) facility woul

have a tremendous impact on t e ‘ "

campus.”

Moye said the new Student L7n- '

ion was being planned to help tos-
ter interaction and intellectual

exchanges between faculty and . 

students. M
"Right now there is no place

where students and teachers can  .;_f:1

be together and rap as equals "
he said. '

“Also,” said Moye, “we need
some place where the students, 60 ,
per cent of which are commuters,  _

can sit down and relax. - .

As a professor in the Clierngis-i
try Department. Moye received? I ,
the Excellence in Teaching award -  I
of the College of Arts and Sci-,
ences in 1971. and his courses 
have been highly rated by stu—. 

dents. “

"This sensitivit_v to students. 

and his ability to work with them

were primary reasons for,his se‘-_‘
lection." said Chancellor Posvar.‘

.  Lets face it one of the most seri-
yous’-problems facing society to-
Vfday is that of drugs. Most of us-
 have read enough about this sub-
ject‘ that it simply has become ac-

;.‘course, we know that drugs are
' sed on campus whether they are
3- the so called “hard core” narcot-
.. cs or something less pronounced

  LETTER’ POLICY

 

All. letters to the Pitt News
must be typewritten and carry
' the full name of the writer
with the school and address. A
name will be withhled upon
’ request if the writer gives rea-
sons for not wanting his name
to appear, but the editors must
know who the writer is. Letters
signed from recognized cam-
pus or community organizations

will be published.

o

cerned with health have even
“gone to pot.” I’m speaking of a
certain Oakland pharmacy with
an interesting window display of
hash pipes and cigarette papers.
This display has been up for at
least a month--now and will prob-
ably continue for some time.

Where do we stand when some
ignorant people in the health pro-
fession are even helping in cat-
alyzing the drug problem?

The pharmacy profession has
plenty of problems and surely
doesn’t need anymore. We realize
that competition is tuff, but when
a pharmacy resorts ‘to selling
‘such items as water pipes, cigar-
ette papers not to mention black
light posters and black lights. then
he should be in the hardware busi-
ness. We don’t need people like‘
this in society and surely not in
pharmacy.

We would like to see some

changes come about in the near '

future. If necessary we will go to
the State Board and get action
there. We strongly urgethe party
involved to take the hint and clean
the windows.

Critics Rocked
Editor. The Pitt News:

After reading the two articles
which appeared in the Pitt News
on Monday, Feb. 26, 1973. con-
cerning ‘recent rock concerts in
Pittsburgh. I figured it was about
time that the writers of these ar-
ticles be justly criticized. It is
apparent that their knowledge of
music is somewhat limited.

Do you‘just pull these writers
off the street thatreview these
concerts‘? It seems like that most
of the time. I would hope that
these writers who call themselves
"rock critics” have some musi-
cal background .of some kind. and
don’t just write these articles bas-
ed on their own personal opinion.
More than personal opinion is
needed when criticizing any con-
cert whether it be rock or classi-
calmusic.

Yet, your writers seem to use
two criteria for judgment. First,
they see if they liked the concert
or not. If they like it they say it
was a good concert and vice ver-
sa. Second, they judge by the
crowd’s reaction. If the crowd re-
sponded favorably to the artis-
tist(s), (got up and clapped
along), it was a good concert in
their opinion. And again the re-
verse is true. .

Now I realize this is only a
school newspaper and it is hard to
get writers, yet alone ones that
h_ave somewhat of "a musical back-
ground to review these concerts.

I also realize these are the writ-
ers‘ opinions, which I do respect.
However, their opinion alone is
not sufficient to write a critical
musical review. And when they
write these articles that is all
they seem to be giving — their
opinions.

I’m not writing this letter be-

cause I always disagree with

these articles—because I do agree
with some of them. But even the
ones I agree with-are not validly
written. They are still only opin-
ions. I am just agreeing with these
writers’ opinions and nothing
more. It just so happens that the
reason I am writing‘ this particu-
lar letter is because_I strongly

disagreed with two recent arti-

cles, and I felt it was time these
writers be openly criticized, but
I hope to do so constructively also.
I have studied music for about»5-6
years so I hope to offer a bit more
in my criticism than opinion.

Barb Geraud’s article. “Croce
Upstages Carlin," was pretty well
written. She gave valid reasons
why Croce was good which con-
sisted of more than only opinion.
I agree with her, and feel Croce
was very good. However. her very
last paragraph or P.S. was ab-
surd. Ture. Carlin was probably

_stoned. he admitted this in a past

interview which appeared in the
Pitt News. 1

_However. he didn't "ramble
on." He was very humorous. He
talked about many things which I
could identify with as I‘m sure
most of the audience could. He re-
lated many events of his earlier
life which I could remember do-
ing myself. His act is muchlike
that of Bill Cosbys. Both of them
discuss simple stories about their
youth in a humorous manner. And
in a manner which most of the au-
dience can identify with. This is
what makes himlso funny. Also.
my three friends who attended the
concert with me that night were
not stoned. neither was I. how-
ever. we all followed and enjoyed
Carlin immensely. True. Croce
was good, but the people came to
see Carlin and he was the hit of
the show.

The "second article which drove
me to write this letter was “Fog-
hat Rocks Chatham with Double
Exposure.” This was such a bad
article, based all on opinion. All
it did was tell the personnel of the
group, the history of the group,
and a few remarks by one of its
members. The only thing that got
close to a musical review was the
last paragraph which still didn’t
say much. It seems like the au-
thor, who is unidentified, seemed
to think Foghat did a great job,
because the crowed got to their
feet halfway through the perform-
ance. That is a bad way to-review
a concert.

I was at the concert and felt
the opposite. Rod Price played a
mediocre slide guitar through-
out. He was sloppy. ran chords
together. and was slow on a few
chord changes. adding to his slop-
piness. The music was blended
okay. but when it came time for
an instrument to play a lead part
1t'was barely audible over the
other instruments. Lonesome
Dave‘s voice cracked once or
twice. and over all Foghat was
not more professional in their mu-
sic than Three Rivers or Cypress
Grove. All in all, unfortunately.
Foghat was a long shot from the
more together sound that Savoy
Brown used to have.

I realize my writing also con-
tains my opinions. but I briefly
tried to back up my opinions with
valid facts. I only did it briefly to
show what I meant and to give
somewhat of an idea of how a cri-
tical musical review should be
written. -. —

  Transit System
Urgently Needed

by HARVDY WEISBERG

Do you want a renovated transportation system in this city‘? There
are sound reasons for advocating change. By 1975, the amount of car-
bon monoxide in the air of beautiful downtown Pittsburgh must be de-
creased by 51 per cent according to federal law. How can this be ac-
complished most efficiently‘? Some say that Skybus is the answers.
some feel that a system of car pools is a possible solution. while others
believe in banning all automobiles from the central business district. If
new highways are built to alleviate traffic corigestion. will the deplaced
housing be rebuilt elsewhere in the area.

The task that must be performed is clear—a careful consideration
of each proposal and the enactment of the best one. Who will perform
this task is not clear. There are numerous environmental. transporta-
tion. and planning agencies doing research on the problem and there
have been open hearings concerning mass transit. But, so far. there
has been no solutions found, only conflicting suggestions offered.

This University can do much to help. Professors should offer per- “

tinent courses and head independent studies during this summer and
fall. The Public Interest Research Group of the University is now co-
ordinating efforts of the University and the community to pool re-
sources to solve this problem. Any faculty member or student is en-
couraged to stop by the PIRG office in 313
4300 to discuss any possible course. ‘

_ Much research on the environmental implications. allocation of tax
monies, and the law must be conducted in order to get some understand-
ing of the problems. Students may be able to work with peopleat the
various agencies involved. The information obtained can then be broad-
cast on Speak Out Messages on television and" through other media re-
sources. Speakers will be able to inform the public at forums and meet-

ings. In this way. more people would become aware" of the real situa- ~

I   Rules Are Rules

by LARRY PLATT

Though the United States has ended its involvement in Vietnamand
has had its POWS returned. there still remains one consequence of
the war the United States is going to have to face. Namely. what do we
do with draft evaders? Do we grant them amnesty‘? Nixon has publicly
stated that he will not grant amnesty "for to grant amnesty is to for-
give. and for them there can be no forgiveness. because they-broke the
law." Let us look now into the future and see what happens when Nixon
is in a position similar to the exiled draft evaders.

(Scene: Gates of Heaven. Nixon coming before God on'his judgment

g clay.)

Nixon: Hello I God. Well. since I’m dead, I‘m ready to enter Heav-
en. It‘s been so long since I’ve seen my family and friends.

God: Not so fast Richard, don’t be so presumptous. You have been
denied admission to Heaven. You are never to come back, unless, of
course, you want to spend a couple of years in purgatory. ‘

Nixon: Purgatory, what do you mean? I didn’t do anything wrong.
I went to church; I believe in you. What more do I have to do?

God: Richard, you were involved in and responsible for the deaths
of tens of thousands of people. In the TenlCommandments, the law spe-
cifically states: _“Thou shalt not kill.” Therefore, you have sinned by.
breaking the_law and have lost.the privilege that would allow you to
enter Heaven.

Nixon: Wait a minute God, I know I broke your law but I couldn’t
violate my conscience. I did what I had to and what I thought was right.

God: That is all well and good, but you knew you were violating the
law, and so you have to pay the consequences. Those who obeyed had to
suffer the misery of imprisonment or permanent exile from their coun-
try and separation from familyand friends. How can I let you off with-
out a term in purgatory?

Nixon: What do you mean let me off? I still don’t think I did‘ any-
thing wrong. How do you know I even want to enter your Heaven?

,

God: Richard, everybody wants to be a citizen of Heaven. It’s the ;

freest place in infinity. It is the only place where you can be free to do
what you want. In Heaven you can be an individual.

Nixon: Well. then why am I being punished for following my con-
science? ’

g God: You don’t want anarchy do you? We have to have certain laws
that must be obeyed in order to create an environment that is conducive
to individualism and freedom.

Nixon: Well, let’s say for a minute that I did do wrong, though I
want to make it perfectly clear that I don’t think I did. What about all
that Christian morality stuff you alvslays fed us in Your speeches? You
know. God will forgive. humble yourself before the Lord, He will take
pity on you. ’ ’ ’

God: Come on Richard, I thought you prided yourself on being a
realist, not an idealist. If we let you off, what is to deter others from
breaking the law? “To allow you to enter Heaven, would mean forgive-
ness. And for you there can be no forgiveness, because you broke the
law.”

iAc:o|umn And A Hair

By JOHN METCALFE

l have just recently made a scientilic discov-
ery which seems to deserve further investigation.
Unfortunately. I am a medium-sized person of
modest means. and cannot give this matter the
attention it deserves.

Cats are not fond of— bagpipe music. Perhaps
I should rephrase that. Some cats do not like bag-
pipe music. "Like" is an anthropomorphic term.
Some cats respond negatively to bagpipe music.
"Music“ is a ‘value term. Some cats respond ne-
gatively ti.e. retreat from) the sound of the bag-
pipe.

The sample is too small. At_ least one cat with
whom. . .

With which I am acquainted leaves when-
ever I play bagpipe music on the resident music

system. My roommate goes out and stands by the I

refrigerator with her arms wrapped tightly about
her ears. I appear to be passive when it plays, but
my mind dashes up and down lochs and leas _in
the most warlike way imaginable. ’

Bagpipe music may be the most powerful stim-
ulus still available to a jaded public without a
prescription. -My neighbors have just called to

comment on the example I am playing at the mo-»

ment. My landlady's lawyer is apparently inter-
ested in the subject. She has just told me to ex-
pect a letter from him. V

"The cat doeslnot like it.— I am writing this in a
remote part of our spacious quarters’. by way of
two low-grade speakers. We who are fond of‘ the
bagpipe often encounter negative reactions. I am
mostly Irish and English. with a bit reserved for

miscellaneous. but there is room for a little splash
of Scotch. I got that joke from an aunt.

So far this seems to have consisted entirely of
digressions. There is a point to it all. lam ethnic.
As ‘an Irishman I can pick sides. but I do not
much like either. As a fractional Englishman I
have little to do but mourn the end of Empire and
worry whether or not I secretly fear the Pakistanis
will move into my ancestral tenements. Theipros—
pect is grim. But I can always be a Scot; I

in streams left clean because industry somehow‘

passed Scotland by. They are entirely _admirable
people.

—~ Records of bagpipe music are available through
certain dealers in the area. I recommend them. If
classical tastes are too much trouble, they will
wake you up. If your rock seems to be rolling into
little tufts of electronic fuzz, a brief listen to the
bagpipe. may be just what it takes to refresh your
musical palate after a steady diet of sonic Rip-
ple. If you are addicted to “easy listening”, take
cheer. They would never dare play bagpipe in an
elevator.

My grandmother on the Irish side claims that
"the bagpipe was invented by the Irish. and stolen
_by the Scots. who had failed. to get the joke. The
French call the bagpipe a "musette“. The Ger-

mans call it a f'Dudelsack".. Make of that what _,

youwill. .
I have ‘gone on long enough. One of the

charms of bagpipe music is that it ends abruptly.
Like this.

Daniel Halpern doesn't tell
you what his "subjects" are. No.
it is clear — his subjects are the
life and times of a sympathetic
lover. the shock and the boredom
of a frustrated anthropologist.
and the joy of a man who loves
good wine. and the mountains
and the sea.

Halpern, who ha_s gained such
acclaim for his book,\Trave|ling
on Credit, is a man who sees
the world in simply sublimated,
sublime terms. His images are of
talking . African parrots who
listen to lovers on a starlit es-
tactic night. His images are of
friends who live by means of
“rituals and beliefs and plans.” A

_In [one poem. his signature
poem. Halpern talks about a girl
who lives in .the mountains of
West Virginia. and keeps alive
by explaining the world. One
of her sa’yings'is ;‘Birds stay
,'away from crooked houses‘. the
poet. summarizes:“Iike her house,
at -a.slight' angle she lives her
life.” . , ,

'-“Is;-,,And again.-as with Darr's des-
cription of at woman.who flies
away from death and grief. Hal-
pern talks and seems to have
written unconclusively. disap-
pointingly. about a world which

he feels and sees with incredi-

ble clarity. .

Marc Weber was the last. to
speak as the winner of the Inter-
national Poetry Forum Award
for this year, he was the man

 

.«

that we all awaited. Marc Web-
er was the poet that should have
par excellence, that~’should have
been impressive, that should
have left us rocking in our seats
in a death-rattle of verbal bliss.

He didn‘t. He is unassuming.
small. long-tailed and bushy-
eyed. A person so much of our
generation that the audience
couldn‘t help but be taken
aback. And he gigglednervously.
tried to shrug off the honor. tried
to smile prophetically as he
read the poetry that was clearly
the expression of his youth and
his coming of age.

Weber divided his‘ poemsinto .-
_ three.'_ groups.. cau7tioning_"-that it,
would A be ha'1“d.'to "tell one. poem --
from another and onegroup of‘

poems from. another. First he
talked about descriptions of emo-
tions and times and places that
were real to him on non-verbal

level ‘and expressable for us on .

a verbal level.
His signature’ poem The Grot-
to, is description of a camping

trip and the discovery of a past '

and a future under a rock. He
read sonorously‘:
up by the grotto aspens were
tense around its mouth
the sound of the river came
from below then the darkness
took its moss hung down below
the black strings around the
mouth wet rock down belowA 4
water in the depths ,
voices barely heard in whispers

to get out

From there he went on to
read his poems of degeneration.
One cannot give citations be-
cause these poems deal too sim-
ply. too complexly with the
emotions of self-pity and dis-

gust. These poems describe a
desperate loss offaith in ones
own ability. and do so with a
passion and a joy which only
careful perusal or the poet's
voice could evoke. ,

webe'i- finished brilliantly. He

‘achieved a "crescendo of emo-
tional release as he read his
love poems. And yet. these
poems were unsettling in their
lack" of direction. They came
from nowhere and were headed
in a direction that only Jorge
Luis Borjes could explain. This
direction is neither on the com-
pass nor on an atmospheric
chart but is_ certainly a direc-
tion.

And perhaps it is here that
one finds both the pleasure and
the pain that resulted from Wed-
nesday evening’s poetry reading.
Marc Weber‘, Ann Darr and
Daniel Halpern took their and-
ience in a direction, and took
them there strongly. But what
that direction was, from whence
it came and toward where it
lead are impossible questions.
Unfortunately, for me, a simple-
minded student, this excess of in-
conclusiveness was disappointing
and unsettling, yet beautifully
exciting.

'-“A Quiet Revolution"

Fine Arts Curriculum Revamped

by JOHN-AMSON CAPITMAN

The Department of Fine Arts is
involved in what Department
Chairman Donald E. Gordon calls
a “quiet revolution.“ The depart-
ment now believes that "distri-
bution courses in Fine Arts should
be a pleasurable and stimulating
experience and not thought of in

- relation to the undergraduate ma-
jor."

Gordon went on to discuss three
new undergraduate courses and

.» the "revamping" of Fine Arts 80.
the introductory survey course
inithe History of Art. all of which
reflect his attitude that “students
are not going to be penalized for

. taking’ Art History courses but
rather will be encouraged‘ to go
on and take more courses in the
field."

The three new courses in the de-

A partment’s fall term offerings are
William -Judson’s ‘The History of
Film 1895-1960;‘ Aaron Sheon’s
Photography of Art;.' and Mi.lla_rd
F. -Hearn's The City. a
. Judson. who is presently a lec-
turer at Tale. has a reputation.
according to Gordon as being "one

,—..of the top young film specialists A

inthe country." His course will be

i"‘--.., a stylistic and theoretical survey

?of the development of European

-‘ and American film making as ex-

emplified by the masters-of nar-
rative cinematography. The
course will meet in the Carnegie
Lecture Hall for the viewing of
films and two days a week in the
Frick Fine Arts Building.

Photography of Art will be of-
fered by Sheon. who as an as-
sociate professor of modern art.
and a specialist in the relation-

ship between art and technology.

Gordon promises theatre courses '

will_be “exciting." Though no
prior technical knowledge of pho-
tography is required. the course
willdeal with such topics as
"photography without cameras"

and “realism in pghotography and

art."
Hearn, next year’s acting chair-
man of the Fine Arts Department,

and a scholar of the History of Ar— .

chitecture and Medieval'Art, will

be offering a course entitled The.

City.

>

DR. GORDON, in foreground, chairman of the Fine Arts Department, dis-_

teraction between human value

and the urban environment."
Though Gordon stressed the "in-

novative" nature of the course

f'or ‘next fallfhe made it clear"

that "these are only the most ob-

vious examples of the depart-*

ments increasing focus on the
undergraduates needs and de-
sires. '

He explained that Fine Art’s 80
is being re-designed so that “we
can introduce excitement and var-
iation into this large course."

  

cusses three new undergraduate courses being offered next fall by his de-
partment. With him is Millard Hearn, in middle, who willwbe teaching a

sent Photography of Art.

Students will be introduced to
such material as "development
of the urban center in western
civilization from Ancient Greece
to the present. including contem-
porary visionary ideas." The
course is intended “to expand the

For every basketball team that ends its season. as the 1972-
73 Pitt Panther hoopsters did Tuesday night at West Virginia.

the month of March is inevitably there to stare it in the face.

The big winners are busy calculating their tournament
chances; other winners are busy noting their improvement;
the near .500. the .500, and the losing squads bury their thoughts

in the statistics searching for the answer to post—season play.

It is true that the only statistic that really counts is the
that concerned

won_ lost column. The winners aren't really
about the res-t. The losers, however. . . . .

Unless they inventone of their own, the Panthers aren’t

going to any tourney and, naturally, the answer for t

‘some where in the inconclusive numbers.

Wednesday afternoon, coaches Fran Web-
ster and Buzz Ridl were taking a hard-close
look at the differentials. And. some of the
things that popped up were down right shock-
ing. ' ‘ I _

Under the leadership of Ridl over the last
four years. Pitt has played in 98 ball games

Rfand has won 50 of them. This is believable
enough. But, boggling to the mind are some other not-so-believ- ,

able numbers.

     

hem lies

'..»e9:$‘...~.:~
FRAN WEBSTER

For instance, would you believe that the Pitt Cagers, des-
pite their.50-48 mark over the same said years, have out field
goaled the opponent 80 per cent of the time? Is it possible for
the same team to lose all 16 games in which they wereout shot
from the field, in that same period of time, and only win two of

12 games where the field goals were evenly matched.

How about this one. The only team that has consistently
shellacked the Panthers over the. last four years have been the
Temple Owls. Pitt has faced such formidable opposition as the
North Carolina Tar Heels. the UCLA Bruins, the: Duquesne

‘ Dukes, the Virgini_a Cavaliers. and Davidson.

In 80 minutes"of action against UCLA the Panthers have
shot one less bucket. When the Bruins defeated Pitt in the Steel
Bowl two years ago, they made 27 buckets to Pitt’s 26. At Pauley

3,,‘ Pavillion this year, both copped 33. Yet. Pitt lost. 77-64. at the
. Arena and. 89-73. at Los Angeles. Virginia was yet to outshoot

the Cats. and Duquesne has also managed a mere field goal

more the last three years.

_ What this means, of course, is that the Oaklanders have
come out on the short end of the charity line. But, please, keep

your towel, Ridl and Webster aren’t crying.

"Our aim is not to make excuses or to blame this all on the
officiating." Webster said, raising his eyebrows and putting his

pencil down. I

"We are just stating plain statistics. We are studying and
researching what causes fouls in general. We have been studying
the -films all year and we have yet to come up with an answer.
Fouling late in the game when you are behind can be part of the
answer. but that hasn't been too evident for us. Also, playing

home and away has a lot to do with it.”

i If you have followed Pitt basketball this year, you know that
the Cats got a raw deal at Pepperdine (away), “technically”
shortchanged at George Washington (away), and crucified by
Virginia (home), to namea few. Pitt opponents have shot 572
fouls to Pitt’s 357 and have made 392 free throws to the Cats’ 240.

But you know, somehow its hard to visualize that all offi-
cials are out to get Pi.tt. Maybe ‘the hoopsters are two aggres-
sive. The probable answer is likely found in some combination

of the two.

‘ Maybe if Pitt became more timid and somehow gotdiffer-
ent officials things would change. But it would be much easier
to just have a winning‘ record’. Then statistics wouldn‘t matter

Chuck Mozingo and Ted Bobby. In
the 660 -yard run Rich Jackson
will be competing. These three
tracksters are regulars on the
mile relay team which will not be
participating at Princeton.

The way the schedule is set up
itis impossible to compete in the
440 and 660 and compete in the
vmile relay also. The decision was
made to go with the 440 and 660
yard races.

Tom Moore will be competing
in the 880 yard run. Moore per-

formed well last weekend at Ohio

State. W
The only relay team Pitt will be

taking is the distance medley. .’ 

This team will consist of Ken Si-
lay who will run the 880 leg, Rich

Weaver who will sprint the 4401 .
leg, Rich Markley running the "

quarter mile and Bob Steele will

pick up the anchor ‘mile. Alter- 

nate in the relay is freshman Nick

. Martin.

The distance medley's toughest 6

competition will come from Villa-

nova. Manhattan. St. Johns. and ~ 5

Penn State.

Pitt has competed against _a ' I‘ '‘
lot of the teams that will be at the.

IC's. Manhattan probably has the
best chance of winning. However.‘

the points will be scrambled and

 

 

perior to anyone in the East." re.-
lated Mollenauer.

A definite for the triple jump is
Roosevelt Randall. At Ohio State
last weekend Randall was taking
his jumps from behind the board.
Had he not taken his jumps this
way he ‘would have had several
jumps over 50 feet.

“Roosevelt has an excellent
chance of placing,” said Mol-
lenauer. '

High jumping for Pitt is Tim Ri-
ley and George Jupin. Riley took
third at Ohio State last weekend.
Jupin will have his first taste of
{'big“ competition. being a fresh-
man.

In the 60 yard high hurdles Bill
Kalchthaler and Andre Harris will
be competing. Kalchthaler has
been competing the entire indoor
season but Harris has been out of
action since the meet at Long Is-
land in early January due to pull-
ed muscles.

RICH MARKLEY will run the three quarter mile leg ofthe distance medley 4‘ «

, Cats Wage Unsuccessful ,

’72-’73 Hoop Campaigrt 

by JANICE B_UCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor
All the hopes and aspirations for the 1972-73
Pitt "basketball team drew to a close last Tuesday
night.

For what had been felt by many to be the year \

the Panthers would exhibit some of the finest bas-
ketball to come out of the Field House in quite some
time. proved to be a less than successful campaign.

Tournament dreams were quick to dissolve; all
efforts were then made totry to come up with a
winning sea son.

The year’s work, however, ended. on a sad note
as the Panthers’ crushingi59-58 loss to the West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers sealed the lid on Pitt. This con-
test marked the l4th loss for the Cats against only

   

 

BILL “MOONEY.” RKNIGI-IT was the bright spot. in
the Panthers dismal 1972-73 season. The outstanding
eager leadthe Cats in scoring"and rebounding. ' t

 

12 victories, which shattered the Panthers’ atsl

tempts to collect their fourth straight non-losing:’:1:-

season.

\,Throughout the season Pitt was plagued 

many a disconserting loss. Time and again the cag-
ers collided with disaster. ’ '

The long awaited Steel Bowl Tournament at'\"l'f
the Civic Arena when the Cats got their chance to 1'
’ avenge themselves against the Duquesne Dukes 3.
proved only to be a. source of frustration to the 

hoopsters. v

The Panthers were victimized by their cross-"";..:i'_..__.
town rivals by the score of 67-61, and now will have-  
to wait until next season to show that they are a top I‘ 

college basketball team to be reckoned with.

Dropping contests to rather obscure college" 
V teams as Wittenberg and Pepperdine were not s00th- .

ing the Cats‘ egoeseither.

   
 
 
 

 

 

And what seemed to be more upsetting were the , i 

close games against such topnotched schools as
Notre Dame. George Washington. and West Vi_r-
ginia. -

And needless to say. losing the last game of the’ I’ 

season by one point to the West Virginia "Snakes"’
is no way to finish the year. 1

Although disaster followed the Panthers
throughout the season, the cagers did have many
moments in which their performances were noth-
ing but outstanding- . , I ‘

had some trouble with teams in
the local circuit that Pitt has han-
dled with apparent ease. Indiana,
the Metropolitan Division win-
ners, have battled the Tartans to
a tie early in the season -and only
last Sunday handed C-MU its
first defeat of the season, 3-2, at
the Alpine Ice Chalet.

St. Vincents also came up even
with Carnegie—l\/Iellon earlier in
the campaign. On the other hand.
Pitt leveled Indiana and St. Vin-
cents both times they played each
of the schools. Just why Pitt has
had trouble with C-MU isn't an
easy question to answer.

v_After the first defeat. the ma-
jority of the Pitt skaters were
ashamed to admit that they un-
derestimated the Tartans. Things
have obviously changed from last
year. when the WPIHA was a one

. team league. that team being Pitt.

Pitt's second loss to C-MU was a
major result of one and one thing
only. C-MU outskated the icers.

There’s been some changes on
‘the Pitt team, however, and some
new faces might be on the ice in

"Pitt's head coach of the woin—
en‘s varsity swim team. Virginia
Grindle. will send six top swim-
mersto the Easterns to be held
today and tomorrow at West Ches-

, ter State College.

This is the first time in six years
that Pitt has been able to send
s.wimmers to the Easterns.

The six star tankers that will
represent Pitt are co-captain
Anna Marie Crelli. Sue Price. Ma-
'mie Hertic, Kitty Martin. Linda
Ducik, and captain Ann Wallisch.

Competing in the 200 yard med-
ley relay are Price, Ducik, Hertic,
and Crelli. The 200 yard freestyle
relay will boast Martin, Wallisch,
Price, and Hertic.

Price will also swim in the 50
and 100 yard butterfly events.
Hertic will compete in the 100 and
200 yard freestyle events while
Crelli takes on the opponents in
the 50 and 100 yard breaststroke
events. "

Since the swim season for the
Pitt mermaids ended in the fall.
the six members of the squad that
qualified f'or the Easterns have
been practicing with the men‘s
swim team under the direction of
head coach Dick Bradshaw and

his assistant Mark Cohen.

Wallisch summed up the aspir-
ations of the six tankers. “We
hope to qualify for the national
and we hope now that Pitt rec-
ognizes us as the varsity team
that we are——that they recognize
that there are girl athletes at
Pitt.”

The Pitt Rifle team defeated

The top five scorers for Pitt
were Ashbrook. 256; Tami. 253;
Gray. 251; Crygrymus, 250; and
Filby,234. _

Tomorrow the gunmen host the
West Penn Sectionals. Participat-
ing teams include IUP, Carnegie-

Geneva, Washington and Jeffer-
son, Beaver County Community
College, and Duquesne.

Also coming up soon is the Pitt
Invitational, and teams that have
been invited so far include Gan-
non College. the University of Cin-
cinnati, and Ohio State Universi-

ty.

The matches are held in Trees
Hall.

He led the Pitt.

Pitt scorers. The 617 points that
Knight collected this season
marked the first time a Cat sur-
passed the 600 total since Don
Hennon in 1958.

Junior Mickey Martin comple-
mented Knight well. sparking the
Cats to many victories with his
shooting ability the ended the sea-
son as the second highest scorer
with 12 points per game l.

This was a great boost for Mar-
tin who was hampered last year
with pre-season illness and a se-
vere ankle injury which kept him
out most of the season and held
him to a 5.8 shooting average.

' A pleasant addition to the var-
sity squad from the ranks of last
year’s frosh team was Kirk Bruce
whose accurate shooting figured in

- on many of the Panthers’ wins.

Junior center, Jim Bolla start-
ed out slow this year but toward
the later part of the season show-
ed signs of maybe being the big
man that the Panthers need. And
Lucius Keese. another center
for Pitt, managed to get a roar
from the home crowds and an
occasional standing ovation no
matter what he did.

Even the freshmen cagers got
into the act. Tom Richards and
Keith Starr broke the ranksot
the trosh squad and saw plenty of
actionduring the year. Both show-
ed the signs of being young and
inexperienced but also the signs
of ‘being a great deal of help in
the future for the Panthers.

The Cats will be losing the serv-
ices of seniors Carl Morris and
Bill Sulkowski but since these
players saw very limited action
during the season, essentially the
same squad will be returning.

So next year it 'will start all
over again for this same group of
athletes. And hopefully a winning
season may come their way.

Virus Costs   Templin

Perfect Season Mark

b!y YAIER LEHRER

Illness has been a prime prob-
lem for tlte Panther swimmers
this season and no one knows it
better than John Templin. If it
weren't for flu-virus. Templin
could well have been Pitts only
undefeated swimmer. ‘

The flu bug severely crippled
the mermen and John was no ex-
ception. Because of his illness
right before the Syracuse meet.
he lost his only breaststroke race
of the season.

John has a‘ chance to make up
for it. though. as he will probably
face the same swimmer when he
travels to theﬁasterns March 8-
10 to compete in the 100 and 200-
yard breaststroke and in the 440-
yard medley relay.

“I feel that I have a good shot
at qualifying for the NCAA’s in the
200 and 100-yard breaststroke.”
said Templin. “I’ve swam pretty
-close to it all year and now ttiat
I’m over this sickness, I think I
have a good chance of making it.”

The Easterns are a long way off

 for Templin. since his high school

days when the school didn‘t have
a pool. much less a swim team.

He started swimming three
years ago at the Oakmont YMCA
with the Greater Pittsburgh Swim
Club. the local AAU team. John
caught the eye of head coach Dick
Bradshaw and was recruited to
come to Pitt. a move which has
very well for both
sides. Templin enjoys swimming
for Pitt immensely. while there is
no doubt that Bradshaw enjoys
having a swimmer of his caliber
on the team.

“‘I’m very pleased with my per-
formance, this year and hope to
get all my strength back in time,”
said Templin. “I plan to work out
this summer, lifting weights,
mostly. I’m not as strong as I
should be.

"Ive set a goal for myself for
next season." he explained. "I
hope to be swimming around 2:11
or 2:12 in the 200-yard breast-
stroke event." 1

Right now lies swimming
around 2:16 in that race and needs
to reach 2:15 during the.Easterns
to qualify for the National cham-
pionships.

“I try to get myself psyched up
for every race,” commented the
Riverview High grad. “I get psy-
ched up first and then I start to
worry as the: race gets nearer. I
think that worrying helps a lot} It
keeps my mind on the race. ‘I

Gymnasts Face Cadets

by YAIER LEHRER

The Panther gymnasts will
again be shorthanded this week-
end as they face the Cadets of
West Point.

Being shorthanded is the story
of the gymnasts‘ entire season.
They have never been able to
enter as many men into the meet
as their opponents have. and they
therefore have not beeen able to
score as many points. Conse-
quently. they have yet to win a
meet this season.

Dick Pribis should do very well
against the Cadets in the floor
exercises and may expect some
help from Chris Gardener and
Dan Campbell in that event.

Freshman Gary Wolfe will be
competing on the pommel horse
along with Carl Bell, Lee Lilly,
and Bob Rodgers. There are four
men competing in this event,

' which is the most the Panthers

were able to enter in ahy one
event while the Cadets will prob-
ably have five men in each event.
This will cost the Cats a great
deal of potential points in the
meet, an obstacle which will not
be easy to overcome.

.On the still rings. Campbell.
John Hirning. and Cliff Custer
will try to capture some very des-
perately needed places for the
team.

Team captain Elliot Sanfdt will
complete in the longhorse vault-
_ing with Pribis and Campbell.

“The only reason many of the
gymnasts competed this year was
to save the gymnastic team,”
said Sanfdt. “It we hadn’t com-
peted, then the athletic depart-
ment would have scrapped the
team and left it completely with-
out funding.”

Pribis. Sanfdt. and Campbell

will'be -working on the parallel
-bars and Pribis and -Campbell

will also be competing in the hor- g

izontal bar.

The team is sending four of
its members to the Easterns.
which is somewhat of a consola-
tion. At the Easterns. we will be
able to focus more on the individ-
ual gymnast and not have to look
at the team record.

With only two seniors graduat-

of live more cagers on the varsi-
