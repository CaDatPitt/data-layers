Concert  

By Mahita Gajanan
Staﬂ" Writer

An all—girls rendition of the Back-
street Boys’ hit “Everybody” kicked
off the time warp to the 19905 Fri.-
day night. —

The Pitt acappellagroup Sounds

_ of Pleasure opened up for “I Love

the ’90s,” a beneﬁt concert hosted
by Pitt’s National Societyof Col-
legiate Scholars to raise awareness
and money for Power Up Gambia.
a nonproﬁt organization dedicated
to bringing electricity and water
to health care facilities in Gambia,
the smallest country on Africa’s
mainland. '

“We’re ’90s children, so it was
really entertaining,” said junior
Amy Liptak about the 90-minute
event. ‘

About 150 people traveled back
two decades at.the O’Hara Student
Center to the tunes from six perfor-
mances and two presentations that
focused on the lack of electricity in
Gambian hospitals. The free event
raised $311 through donations the
group collected at the door to help
equip the Bansang Hospital in Gam-
bia with solar panels.

“There are more people in
sub-Saharan Africa living without
electricity than there are people in

the United States,” said Lynn Mc— _
r Conville, the executive director

for Power Up Gambia, who bused
from Philadelphia to attend the
NSCS event.

McConville said hospitals in
Gambia don’t receive enough elec-

tricity, which becomes a problem '

when blood, vaccines and medica-
tions cannot be refrigeratedand
doctors have to perform procedures
by candlelight. Many Gambians
have to generate electricity using
diesel generators, which often
break down.

“The generators fail and the

wlt funding process

SGB'Alloc_atio_ns Committee held Allocations 101

Byjoe Chilson
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Pitt junior Britta Anderson needs
$50,000 to buy a boat and other
sailing equipment, and on Friday
afternoon she learned how to re-
quest it.

Anderson is in the process of
crafting the ﬁrst budget for Pitt’s new
Sailing Club, but had a little trouble
getting started. ’

“It seems pretty simple at ﬁrst,
but when you’re requesting multiple
items it can get complicated,” Ander-
son said of requesting funding from
the Student Activities Fund.

Anderson’s COI‘lfLlSl0I1 was alle-
viated when she attended Alloca-
tions 101, an information session
designed to help student groups
navigate the allocations process and
request funding through the Student
Government Board.

“I got some great clariﬁcation '

today, and everyone’s been really

‘helpfuljf Anderson said.

The Allocations Committee, a.
group of appointed students who
examine student groups’ funding
requests, and members of SGB held
the second Allocations 101 session in
the William Pitt Union. The half-hour
information session, which about
30 students attended, was held
just before the deadline for student
organizations’ spring budgets on
March 2. g _

Allocations Chair Michael Nites
said he plans to continue Allocations
101 and will hold a session next se-
mester before groups’ budgets are
due. _

The Allocations 1 Committee
works with the Student Government
Board to allocate the more than $2.3
million in the Student Activity Fund
that non— College of General Studies
students pay $80 into each semes-

-Friday to teach students how to ‘request money.

ter.

The committee reviews funding
requests by student groups both in
the form of budgets, which are a
mapping out of a group’s requested
funds for the coming ﬁscal year, and
supplementals, which are requested
on an “as needed” basis.

The Allocations Committee re-
views funding requests line by line
to be certain that the requests are
acceptable to receive funding in ac-
cordance with the guidelines in the
Allocations Manual. —

If the request is under $500, the

committee can approve it imme— «

diately. If the committee denies a
request or the request is more than
$500, the Allocations Committee
makes a recommendation to the
Student Government Board. The
Board then votes on whether or not
to approve the ﬁmding request at
their weekly Tuesday night public
meeting. ' ‘

Nites said that groups knowing

A their SGB liaison is the primary mes-

sage he wanted students to take away
from Allocations 101. ' '

The 12 members of the alloca-
tions committee serve as student
group liaisons, who are tasked with
assisting their assigned student‘
groups in applying for funds and
advocating for their groups during
allocations meetings. Each of Pitt’s
350 student organizations has a liai-
son assigned to it based on its place
in the alphabet.

Allocations Committeemember
Alexander Majchrzak said he sits
down with the groups he is a liai-
son for during his office hours, reads
through their requests and checks
their math. He saidhe does any-

thing he needs to do to know how he

should vote when the request comes
before the committee.
Each request needs seven out of

“I liketo go into all the meetings with a good i

amount of knowledge,” Majchrzak said.
Majchrzak’s job gets tough when a group
requests funding for something that falls within

a gray area in theAl1ocations Manual. Accord— ”
ing to the Allocations Manual, the committee A
can fund -for certain things like lodging or fa— _

cility rental, and not others like“decor‘ations
or food.

“There are many factors we have to con— 1

sider,” Majchrzak said. “It can get kind of

' According to Nites, the confusion abou
what the Student Government Board can and
cannot ﬁind is one of the major problems that
trump students when requesting ﬁinding, and
it is a big reasonfor having a program like Al-
locations 101.

A large portion of Nites’ presentation on
Friday was entitled ‘A‘Request for This, Not for
That,” where Nites recommended that student
leaders study which things SGB is allowed to
pay for and request only for them, supple-
menting the rest of their costs with private
fundraising.

Contraceptive mandate unfair

Stipulating that insurance plans cover contraception infringes on religious freedoms

  

- 3y Mark Kozlowski
- Columnist

Purchasing contraception is sel-
dom discussed in public. But in the
wake of the Department of Health’s
mandate that‘ health insurance
plans.cover contraception, we’re
going to hear a lot more about it.
There are several good reasons
to oppose this mandate. First, it’s
removed any incentive’for phar-
maceutical companies -to develop
cheap contraceptives since they’re
guaranteed consumers at whatever
price they charge. It’s also made
cheaper generics less attractive —
with insurance companies paying
the tab, the cost of contraceptives

' will be hidden from the person

buying them. Insurance compa-

' nies might try to bargain with drug ‘
makers, but they might also ﬁnd it_

easier to quietly raise everyone’s

, premiums. And pharmaceuticals

have no incentive to spend money

developing new contraceptives, -

as the old ones are guaranteed to
sell.

Furthermore, this mandate
hasn’t, as some people believe,

made birth control free. Some-
body’s still going to have to pay
the costs, and those costsare go-
ing to diffuse. Who will pay? Let’s
consider three answers: ' H '
1) “We’ll ‘make the evil insur-

ance corporations pay for it!” But .

where do the evil insurance cor-
porations get their money from, if
not from consumers who will pa
higher premiums? , >
2) “Employers will pay for it!”
They might, but this makes it more
expensive tohave people on pay-
roll, so the cost will come out of
reduced wages or fewer hires.
V 3) “The government will pay for

it!” But the government has to get ,
- money from somewhere. And by .

the way, making the government
pay for things means we need a
larger bureaucracy, which doesn’t
come cheap. ' _ .

In short, the mandate only
spreads the cost around the econ-
orny. This means that the people
who use birth control pay less
because other people — such as
the old,’ impotent, abstinent and
religious — are paying for birth
control that they don’t use.

But the-most important prob-

lem with this mandate is that it’s
a fundamental threat to freedom
of religion, as complying with the
law will require people to violate
their beliefs. Obama’s compromise
— asking that organizations them-
selves do_n’t pay, but their insurers
do — is‘ nothing of the sort. Con-
sidering that these organizations
are paying insurance companies
in the first’ place, this amounts to
paying Peter in order to pay Paul,
and calling it a concession that you
don’t have to pay Paul directly. And

the ﬁnes paid by those who refuse =

to comply constitute a beliefs tax
~— that is, atax that must be ‘paid
because the practitioners of a par-
ticular faith.refused to bend that
faith to the shape the goVernment’s
desires. , T

To those who pooh—pooh this
as evidence of nothing more than
how outoftouch Catholic bishops
are, let me ask you this: How would
you feel if, say, a President Rick
Santorum required all employers
to cover psychiatric treatment to
“cure” -people of homosexuality‘?

quick this attraction lingers. It’s

formationto some people, but
women’ actually li-keguys that are

ducted by University of Pennsyl-
vania evolutionary psychologists
discovered that bothwomenand
men found physical attractive-
ness moreappealing than high
social status when participat-
ing in a speed dating session.
Women will stay in long-term
relationships with men who are
economically and socially well.-

off, they found, but will be ini— '

tially more attracted to physical
qualities. However, “physically
attractive” isn’t operationally
deﬁned, so all this study really
ﬁnds is that women aren’t‘shal—
low gold-diggers. Some women‘
think. guitars and a sexy voice
make ‘a guy irresistible, while
others might just think that same
guy is a whiny, pretentious hip-
ster. Likewise, some women a-re
attracted to Lacoste polos and
Sperry’s, while, others may ﬁnd‘
these same guys to be repulsive

Better hit the_ gym, bro.
In 2007, researchers at UCLA
showed silhouettes of men to
college females and found that

. toned silhouettes who were more

likely to commit to a relationship
were more attractive than either
complete meatheads or scrawny
dudes. Moreover, athletic and

muscular college guys were more

likely to report having sex with

' at least three partners than less

buffestudents. This means you
should bench press your cases
of Natty before you open them
or try and look for any excuse
possible to take your shirt off at
a party so that girls can see how
hot you are. Just make sure you
exercise another muscle before
talki_ng'to a girl: Your brain. If
all girls were only attracted to
muscular men, then the "Pete

and Ryan Goslings of the world
would have girlfriends.

Ignore Her

This one is classic bad boy:
Give her mixed messages to
‘make her so uncertain thatshe
can’t think about anything else.
A 2011 University of Virginia
study‘ revealed that women who

i — were uncertain of guys’ feelings
about them were more likely to -

rate those guys as_attractive.
—Any genius knows this‘ is fool-

v proof: Nothingscreams .“100_

ing a conversation with a girl
and then walking away mid-

sentence, inviting her to dinner V

and never showing up or yell-
ing her name in a room full of

. peopletand then looking away.

If you think neglecting a girl

is an appropriate way to hook '

up with her, you have supreme
problems and should probably
get the head wound you recently
suffered checked out. '
Rather than attempting all
these little manipulative tech-
niques, guys should try to charm
a girl the ‘old-fashioned way:
showing her respect and being
there when she needs someone.
If you know people that use the
previously mentioned tricks to
pick up girls, they probably de-
serve whatever drink is thrown
in their face or heel is thrust to-
ward their groin. Don’t feel sorry
for them —— just pray that they
don’t reproduce so their sexist

don’t _re-enter the gene pool. I

demning this as ridiculous. Youu;

would feel quite angry at having to
pay for something that is an affront
to your beliefs.

Of course, you might argue that
this is a poor analogy, as homo-

sexuality is not a disease that needs 5.‘
to be cured.To which an observant ’

Catholic could respond that nei-
ther is pregnancy. Both your beliefs
and the beliefs of the guy with the
rosary beads are passionately felt.
One set might seem more valid to
you than the other, but you cannot
deny that both exist. And much
as you might like to impose your
beliefs on somebody by persua-
sion or legislative ﬁat, I doubt you
would like to have the same done
to you. ’

Now, I understand that contra- if

ception can be a matter of public
health, is cheaper than abortion
(or a lot of unwanted children)
and that access to ‘item be difﬁcult
for the poor. But according to the
Guttmacher Institute, a center that
started as an offshoot of Planned
Parenthood, the government spent
$1.85 billion on family planning
in 2006, and 54 percent of all
women in need of publicly sub-

sidized care received it. Publicly, -

funded services are estimated to l
have prevented 1.94 million unin-
tended pregnancies. So I wonder
how much this mandate is really
necessary and how much the poor
would belihelped by an expansion of
extant programs. Furthermore, al-
though Ilthink the Catholic Church
is wrong about contraception, they
have the constitutional right to be
as wrong—headed about this as they
please. And by this mandate, the

government sets a dangerous prec- ,5.

edent by which other beliefs can
just as easily be attacked. |

The Pitt wrestling team won the Eastern W1°es1.ling'I.cague title at the Fit‘ gcrald Field House on Frida '

By Dustin Gabler
Staﬁwriter

The victory lights —- seen rarely for
Pitt fans during football season '—
glowed from the top of the Cathe-
dral of Learning for the wrestling
team this weekend.

The No. 9 Pitt wrestling team
won its third straight Eastern
Wrestling League championship
with its win over No. 20 Edinboro
on Friday. R

_ The 26—10 victory also marked
the Panthers’ 18th straight dual
victory. , .

“Winning a third EWL title is
a great feeling,” Pitt’s Tyler Nau-
man said. “I never thought I would

_ say’ my college wrestling team won
‘’ three straight conference titles. It

means a great deal to me and shows
me I helped bring that to Pitt.”

His teammate, sophomore Shel-
ton Mack, said he’s faced high -ex-
pectations forhimself and the team

ya. since he arrived at Pitt.

“Winning the EWL again means
a lot to everyone,” Mack said. “It
was our.goal since the beginning of
the season. It’s great to see things
falling into place.”

Pitt’s N0. 16 Anthony Zanetta

kl bounced back from a loss in his

last match to start the Panthers
out strong at 125 pounds against
Edinboro’s Kory Mines. Zanetta’s

9-0 major decision put four points
on the team score.

Zanetta’s loss last week marked
his ﬁrst in a dual meet, and he used
the loss to propel himself to work
harder. A I

“I used that loss as motivation
and to realize I have to raise my
intensity level up when I wrestle,”
Zanetta said.

No. 24 Mack kept the momen-
tum rolling for the Panthers at 133
pounds with an upset over Edin-
b0ro’s seventh—ranked A.]. Schopp.
Mack scored aﬁrst period takedown
that he held on to for the win.

Mack said he knew that his 

match could be_a key point for the
Panthers, and it propelled the team
on to the win.

“It meant a lot to start the match
like that for the team,” Mack said.
“It helped to get the team ﬁred up
and motivated us to get the job
done.” "

At 141 pounds, Pitt freshman
Travis Shaffer lost to No. 18 Mitch-

Panthers dropi fourth
   consecutive game

Dy Sean Corrado
Staff Writer

Even a career day from sophomore
J.].-.Moore- couldn’t offset the Pitt
men’s basketball team’s offensive

. woes as the Panthers lost their

night.‘ V  
Moore was the only Pitt (15-

‘fourth-straight game on Sunday

13,‘ 4-11‘ Big East), player- to reach ‘

double ﬁgures in the 56-47 loss
to, South Florida at the Petersen
Events Center, setting a new career
high with 21 points and tying his
career mark in minutes with 31.
But the Panthers scored just 20
points in the second half and shot
a dismal 34 percent from the ﬁeld,
including 25 percent from behind
the arc. ’ _A

South Florida (17-10, 10-4 Big
East) held the Panthers without a
ﬁeld goal for over ﬁve minutes late
in the second half, turning a 49-41
lead into a 56-45 advantage.

“I tried to build up a lot of
energy off the bench to get the
win,” Moore said,"‘But we came
up short.”

Moore’s recent improvement

‘ on both sides of the ball has caught
the attention of head coachjamie ‘

Dixon. -
‘5Hi_s shotis looking real nice,”
Dixon said. “It’s_exciting that he’s
made this improvement in his
sophomore season.”

South Floridafreshman guard

' Anthony Collins scored 22 points,

a new career high.

Ashton Gibbs, who was hon-

ored with Nasir Robinson dur-
ing the senior night ceremony.
before the game, wasn’t a factor
against South Florida’s defense.
Gibbs went 1-7 for a season—low
two points; ”

“It’s my job to knock down
shots, but at the same time they
played good defense,” Gibbs said.
He scored just six points in two
games against the Bulls. ‘

South Florida started out the
game impressively, going off on
a 10-1 run early in the ﬁrst half to
build a lead as large as 11-points.
The Bulls worked the ball into_the
paint eﬂiciently-as a team. South
Florida’s early charge was led by

’ _  ,.P'_it1tTfalls ‘despite 21 points from I]. Moore

Collins, who scored eight points
and three assists in the ﬁrst half.
“The addition of Collins has
made them a team in everysense,”
Dixon said. “You got to give them
a lot of credit.”
With Hugh Robertson playing

effective defense against Gibbs,
the Panthers wouldn’t get a spark

o_ﬁ'ensively until Moore checked
in for the second time at the 6:46
mark. ' p 6

The Panthers clawed their
way back into the game. Fresh-
man guard]/ohnjohnson knocked
down his second 3—pointer of the
game to start a 10-2 scoring run
for Pitt. Moore —'- who electri-
ﬁed the crowd with ﬁve dunks —
slammed two dunks back-to—back
off turnovers to tie the game at 22
with 4:15 to go in the half._'

» .Moore hit a 3-point jumper to
raise his ﬁrsthalf total to 11 points
and give the Panthers their ﬁrst
lead of the game with under a min-
ute to go. The Panthers entered
the locker room down by just one
point. 4

“They had a couple runs against

us, but we rebounded very well,-” .

South-Florida head coach Stan
Heath said."

South Florida started the sec-
ond half like it started the ﬁrst,
quickly scoring eight points to
keep Pitt in the rearview for the
rest of the -game. The Bulls’ Victor
Rudd —— who scored 11 points of
his own in the match—up scored
a layup with 2:46,left‘ in the game
to put the Bulls’ lead back into

‘double digits and effectively end

any chance of a Pitt-comeback.

The Bulls hope to build their

NCAA Tournament resume against
the Big East—lea_ding Syracuse
Orange at the Carrier Dome on
Wednesday night. Heath said he’s
conﬁdent in his team, noting that
10 conference wins should bring
them into the national discus-
sion. '

Meanwhile, Pitt will work to-
ward ending its losing streak in
the weeklong break before its
match—up with Louisville.

“It’s the ﬁrst time we can really

practice all year,” Dixon said. “We .

need to ﬁx the things that have
been hurting us all year.”

    winless in Big East play

A By Jasper Wilson
‘Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team tied its
longest losing streak under head coach
Agn_us Berenato on Saturday. b
With the 62-50 loss to South Florida.
(15-13, 7-7 Big East), the Panthers (8-18,
0-13‘Big East) have dropped 12 straight
games — tying their losing streak fro
the 2003-04 season.. ,‘ ' r
' Sophomore guard Asia Logan’s lin-
gering shoulder injury reduced the Pitt
bench to three players, who contributed
just three total points on Saturday.
Logan, a sophomore, played a little over
a minute at the end of the ﬁrst half, but -

' Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato said in a _

text message that it was likely too soon for
Logan to play at all. . ‘
Three players reached double ﬁgures,
’ led by freshman point guard Brianna Kiesel
with 13 points, but the production wasn’t
enough as Pitt fell 62-50.

_Redshirt sophomore Abby Dowd played
16 minuteswithout scoring, grabbirig a
rebound or dishing out an assist. Fresh-
man Chyna Golden played 28 minutes and
col1ected'si$< rebounds, but she failed to
score.

TiAnna Porter, also a freshman, scored .
the bench’s only points, despite seeingjust
eight minutes. 1 ' 1 "

Pitt wentinto the half down two points

_ at 31-29. The Panthers led for close to 19
minutes before ajasmine Wynne jumper
at the buzzer gave South,Florida the ad-
vantage at the break.

Pitt evened the score immediately in

l the second half on an Ashlee‘Anderson

- basket, but the Panthers couldn’t build
momentum as the Bulls ran out to a 38-31

“ lead and stayed ahead for the rest of the

' game. ' ,

, Pitt managed to pull within three points,
40 -37, ‘on a Marquel Davis layup with 14:14

again. -  _

' Wynne led all scorers with 14points. It
was the senior’s ﬁrst game since sustaining a
