Recent graduate Peter Mastracci grew close

the professor as a successful gay man.

“He was a mentor, because" I was an English

I’ll always remember is that his father and my

“I-Iewas soﬁill of life allthe time. He toldthe
most amazing stories of traveling abroad and

really nice to have someone who was gay and
making a way for himself, an inspiration.”

Mastracci said Clarke’s conﬁdence and com-
fort with his own sexuality was “astonishing.”

College Republicans Vice President Matt Ver-
meire said his student group will be following a
similar course of action in support of its party.
Vermeire estimates that more than 30 group
members have been working with campaigns
for a total of more than 200 hours of volunteer
work a week.

Todaytheywill be phone banking, pollwatch—
ing and driving people to the polls who couldn’t
otherwise make the trip. ,

“We are involved now so we can have a bet-

“It helped me understand grassroots move-

EDITORIAL

A Pitt student’s guide

to voting

e’re pretty convinced that voting
in today’s election will probably
be less painful than scheduling
next semester’s classes.
Sp you should probably do it. Here’s
why: ‘
Statistics show you don’t care.
Despite the record-high young-voter
turnout in the 2008 election, young voters
are once again disengaged. _
“Obama won two years ago with’ 66
percent of the 18- to 29-year-old vote, a
historic proportion. Americans under 30
also worked on campaigns at a greater
rate than the general population did for
the first time since 1952, or possibly even
earlier,” reports The _New York Times.
But, the usual midterm ‘effect, in ad-
dition to “an unexpected distance that
has arisen between Mr. Obama and many
young constituents,” is causing many
young voters to lose interest, according
to The New York Times.
But you should care. _
According to some theories, not voting
in an election is the same thing as voting in
an election, because not casting a ballot is
still a ballot cast — for the status quo.
In addition, local elections matter more.
According to an article in last week’s edi-
tion of the Pittsburgh City Paper, “These

_are issues’ you can do something about,

and candidates you can actually vote for.”
These issues include the Marcellusshale
gas drilling, social issues like abortion
and gay ‘marriage, health—care reform,
environmental principles, taxes and eco-
nomic issues.

Another reason this election matters
so much is redistricting, the process by
which state governments can redraw the
boundaries of legislative districts. For
Congressional districts, having a state
legislature and governor of the same party
will allow for “party—friendly” redistrict-
ing. This means that the result of today’s
election will impact politics for many
years to come. ' .

And this is how to show you care:

.. Although there are time and travel costs
associated with voting, Pitt makes it rela-
tively easy for you to "vote with plenty of
polling places nearby. And because the
midterm elections are less popular than
presidential elections, you most likely
won’t face long lines. . '

Even if you don’t have your voter regis-
tration card, you will still be able to vote at

1 the location you voted at last time.

If you are voting for the first time in
this district, you will be able to use your
Panther Card as a form of photo identiﬁca-
tion, according to the Allegheny County
Board of Elections website. I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

Thank you for publishing the article
“Students weigh in on gas drilling” in
yesterday’s paper. The industrial blitz
on Marcellus Shale gas drilling is and
will continue to be one of the most im-
portant issues of our generation, and the

education of our peers is vital for us to _

maintain a decent quality of life for our

' families and ourselves. We must continue

to educate ourselves so that we have the
power to see through the industry’s spin
on the facts, and we must use this power

’ to call out their widespread misinforma-

tion and injustice.

Now is not the time to sit idly by in
apathy while gas companies begin to
deplete drinkable water, pollute breath-
able air and degrade public health. I am

I strongly against drilling for fossil fuels in
the Marcellus Shale because the industry

has not proven they can do so without
these damages, and I believe that it is
time for a legitimate transition to renew-
able energy.

This is my opinion that I have formed
after much research, and I am not asking
everybody to agree. I am asking for every-
body to educate themselves on this issue
and to form an opinion independently. A
Wikipedia search for “hydraulic fractur-
ing” is a good start!

If you would like to take action on
this issue, then please visit http://Pitts-
burghSEC.wordpress.com for details on
how to join other students in peaceful
protest Downtown this tomorrow after-
noon.

This Facebook thing has been'r‘eally'an»-I I

For me, it started getting particularly
bad during the recent “I like it on the
floor” craze, wher_e users — primarily
women — posted where their purses were
located, preceded by the phrase “I like it
on the ...” The whole campaign was start-
ed to promote Breast Cancer Awareness
Month, because apparently talking about
purses helps to promote discussion of and
education about breast cancer. Funny,,I
"wanted to talk about colon health.

The irritating part wasn’t the repetition
or the idea of breast cancer prevention
—~ and for the record, I want to say I am
deﬁnitely anti—cancer. The annoying part
was that thousands of people felt better for
doing their part to prevent breast cancer

by doing nothing more than typing a few

words into a text box.

Campaigns like this normally have only
questionable success. They might raise a
modicum of awareness in the vague gen-
eral sense, but only in a way that says “I
thought about breast cancer today.” The
pink fountains, pink shoes and the overall

sexiﬁcation and marketing of the disease

do little to increase people’s fundamental

understanding of it._

Evidence? Thel:C_le,7nter for Disease Con-
trol says that screening rates have pla-
teaued at 80 percent-since 2000. A 2009
study in thejournal of the National Cancer
Institute showedrthat in Europe, where
marketing methods are similar to the
United ‘States, there is confusion over the
risk of the disease and the effectiveness
of mammograms.'.Plus, think to yourself:
after you take part in this campaign, do
you feel like you have a grasp of breast-
cancer risk factors?‘

And it’s not like they earned veryvmuch

money for cancer research with this strat-
egy, either. Most social networking—based
charity spurs very few actual donations. As
noted byjim Tobin, president of Ignite So-
cial Media, ina recent Associated Press ar-
ticle, “You often see where 20,000 people
havejoined a cause and it’s raised $200.”
The money very rarely reaches the levels
Internet enthusiasm would suggest.

So although the intentions were good,

nothing was ultimately done to improve '

very little useful awareness and instead
mainly served the primary purpose of In-
ternet activism —- self-satisfaction on the
part of the user. '
Yet this kind of advocacy for special
causes continues on the Internet. Breast

-cancer awareness is not the only culprit.

October saw Fat Talk Free Week, which
discouraged derisive comments about
weight and which I guarantee did nothing
to actually change anything in a meaning-
ful way.

Add to this the huge list of general ad-

" vocacy groups available on socialémedia .

networks, ranging in topic from Tibetan
independence to eliminating childhood
poverty, and it’s clear that promoting per-
sonal charitable work is very popular.
Now, not all of these are useless._]oin—
ing a group for an obscure cause that re-
ally just needs to get its name out there is

legitimate. Perhaps, when people search
-through yourpage, they will see you are

in a group for a local family who lost their
home in a fire or a Sherpa awareness fund
and they too will feel passion for your
cause. . - 1

But in the case of a big cause, you might
be acting more like a man consoling his

. lady friend after a bad breakup. You prob-

—satisfaction, not results

ably do care about her, and you do want to
see her happy, but your support might just
be to promote an ulterior motive. Wink.
For a consoling friend, the motive
might be to turn your lady friend into
something more. For Facebookcharity,
the motive is often self-satisfaction and
good standing. The payoff isn’t necessar-
ily making a difference, but just having
the knowledge that one is kind of doing
his part to make the world a better place.
Which again, isn’t a bad thing — in the
very least, it does make people happy. But
if it becomes Internet charity’s primary

purpose, is it worth it?

Cincinnati Enquirer columnist Krista
Ramsey, whose sister has breast cancer,
doesn’t think so: “‘Awareness’ about breast
cancer — being able to say the words aloud

‘ and stick pink ribbons on everything from

dog collars to skyscrapers — is a far cry
from cure.”

The frivolity of the whole process
doesn’t make her happy. And if we con-
tinue to content ourselves with Facebook
charity, with fad philanthropy, perhaps
our generation — which is supposedly
very proactive and compassionate — isn’t
as useful as we would like to believe. 1

Although temperatures have
dropped and the local -wildlife

has retreatedto warmer pastures,
indie-rock act Plants and Animals
hopes to compensate for Pitts-
burgh’s depleted ﬂora and fauna.

The Montreal-based band
prides itself on an organic sound,
self-described as “post-cl_assical,’.’
-but with an original twist.

“We’re a rock band. I mean re-
ally, what other genres are there?”

joked lead vocalist and guitarist

Warren Spicer. I

“Well, we’re a little old school, a
mix of rock, classic, blues soul —
you know, the works,”‘drummer
Matthew “Woody” Woodley said.

For its latest album - La ‘La
Land, released April'2010 —. the
band tried to emulate its live sound
—— something Woodley feels its ﬁrst
album, Para Avenue, lacked.

“The second time around we
wanted to try something new. It
is an extension of our live show.
There’s only three of us live, but
our last studio album had all this
other stuff going on. This one is
more indicative of our core sound,”
Woodley said.

To accomplish this, Woodley
and Spicer, along with guitarist

. Nicolas Basque, stuck to their tried-

and-true approach to recording.
“We’re just trying to make mu-
sic, there’s‘ really no message over-
all. It’s just music, just a record,”
Spicer said. -
Woodley had a similarly noncha—
lant description of the process.
“It’s an organic thing. Warren
comes up with some stuff. Then we
listen to them, start grooving and
just keep driving until we’re done”
Woodley added.
Partiallyrecording the record
in its native Montreal and partially
at Studios La Frette outside Paris,
Plants and Animals drew inspira-
tion from the French city’s simulta-
neously historical and progressive
music scene. '

Warren Spicer:

/

“We were used to Montreal. Our »

studio was small, very cozy.’ Then
we get to.Paris, and this studio is
in this great big manor where we’re
staying,,with all these trees and
birds. Of course that environment

is going to affect you,” Woodley‘

said.

The overall effect is that La La
Land is a smoother and more cohe-
sive snapshot of what the band is,
without all the bells and whistles.

The band members have honed
their skills, playing with more con-

ﬁdence and putting out a more well— ‘
rounded album. Songs like “Fake

It” and “Tom Cruz” give listeners
an example of what the band can do
without coming on too strong.

And though the band members
hope to someday return to Paris,
for now, they’re just focusing on
playing more music, be it in the
studio or on tour.

’ “Our job is to make music,
and I’m‘ just trying to do it more. I
don’t know what I’d do otherwise.”
Woodley said. “We enjoy both tour-
ing and recording. When you’re out

on the road,you want to go back to I
the studioand come.up with new

stuff, but when you’re recording,
you get the itch to _play for a crowd

‘of real people —— or at least I do.”

On the band’s to—do list is to con-

tinue carving out a place for itself
in America’s music scene. Already
a ﬁxture in the Canadian indie cul-
ture — the band was nominated for
twojuno Awards in 2009 after the
release of Para/lveizzze — Plants and
Animals plans on feeding its grow-
ing U.S. fan base by touring.

I “There’s really not too big a dif-
ference. People are people. I guess
Canada is a lot more connected
though. People just tend to know

‘ everyone. In the States, it’s deﬁ-

nitely more profound. You have to
do more work, put in more time,”
Spicer said. . . I

When Jodi Kimura,-left Denver 10
months ago, she knew she wouldn’t
see her home for a long time. Now,
after only a short return, she’s con-

tinuing her tour in Pittsburgh with
her family away from home: her
fellow cast members. V

In 2009, Kimura joined the Lin-
coln Center Theater Production
of the Broadway revival of “South
Paciﬁc,” the famous 1949 Rodgers
and Hammerstein musical about

members of the U.S. Navy during
World War II. The play contains
many Broadway standards, includ-
ing “Some Enchanted Evening,”
“Younger Than Springtime,” “Bali
Ha’i” and “There is Nothin’ Like a
Dame.” Kimura plays Bloody Mary,
a Tonkinese woman who intrigues

American sailors with her souvea:
nirs.

“A lot of my fellow cast mem-
bers decided to go on vacation this
week, but I really just wanted to
come home and drink coffee from
my own coffee pot and sleep in my_,_
own bed,” Kimura said. h‘

Keala Settle plays Bloody Mary, surrounded by Seabees. Jodi Kimura will play Bloody
Mary in the same production when it hits Pittsburgh tomorrow.

While the break was a breath of fresh
air for Kimura, she missed the 30—plus cast
members of “South Paciﬁc” that have made
her experience worthwhile.

“It’s the nature of the beast -— you work
together and spend your time off together.
When you create something together there
is a bond that you have,” she said.

Kimura said there’s.scarcely a moment
she doesn’t spend with her fellow actors.

“We eat together, room together, stay in
the same hotels and travel together  we
are just one big, dysﬁinctional yet loving
family,” she said.

The cast does eight shows aweek — they
pack on Sunday and travel on Monday. When
they ﬁnd that rare spare time to go out and
explore a new city, Kimura and the rest of
the cast like to discover thelocal eateries or
coffee houses. .

“The tour tries to organize fun things for
us to do, so when we are not performing we
have a chance to enjoy the cultural surround-
ings of each city,” Kimura said.

The cast’s schedule might be intense, but
members do their best to make time for each
other and celebrate the various birthdays
and special occasions that do occur.

“We have birthday cake about two to
three times a week. It’s always somebody’s
birthday,” Kimura said.

Despite the on-set camaraderie, some-

times tensions do run high.

“I appreciate that we do have artistic
squabbles, and I ultimately think it’s be-
cause people care so much about the show
and care so much about what we are all do-
ing. It’s about passion and being the best
that we can be and sometimes people get
frustrated,” she said.

Kimura and the rest of the “South Paciﬁc”
cast do their best to keep their characters
fresh and genuine each time they step onto
a new stage in a new city. Their ultimate goal
is to evoke laughter, gasps and applause at
the end of a. show.

“That’s how you know you’ve told the
story correctly,” Kimura said.

“South Paciﬁc” owes a successful recep-
tion, in part, to high production values.

“The show has a 26—member orchestra,

‘ which is extremely impressive for a musical,”

Annabelle Clippinger, the director of Pitt
Arts, said. “Usually nine out of 10 musicals
have recorded music.”

,While “South Paciﬁc” contains many
lighthearted moments, Kimura said she
views the play as fearless in its observa-
tions. ,

“‘South Paciﬁc’ is so powerful by how
it focuses on the truth of the characters,
the truth of the times and the truth of the
situation,” she said. “It shies away from
nothing.” I

hat soi19r1?dyoiu~hear is SEC fans cry-
ing for the Big East to lose its automatic
BCS bid. Currently, the Big Eastis among
six conferences whose champion is auto-
matically invited to a BCS_Bowl-. But the
Big East’s mediocrity over the past few
seasons is inviting questions as to why
the conference should be considered one
of the “top 6.” 1

The Mountain West currently looks
like the conference poised to take the Big
East’s place should Pitt’s conference get
the boot from the BCS.‘ Utah and TCU have
made a name for the Mountain West, and
America’s favorite underdog, Boise State,
announced last summer that it would be
joining the conference. 2 .
But when Utah jumped ship to the Pac-

  

  

10, it hurt the Mountain West’s chances of

becoming a BCS conference.

So for this week’s Top 10, I give you 10
reasons why the Big East should keep its
automatic bid.

10. History. The Big East-conference
teams claim 11 national championships
among its eight members. (Sure, Pitt ac-
counts for nine of them, but try not to
think about that.)The Mountain West has
only claimed three Division I-A titles. The
Big East is in a rut, butnothingjustiﬁes
throwing out a league with so much history.
And this isn’t even taking into account the
fact that West Virginia is in the winningest
program in college football that has yet to
win a championship.

Amy Town (No. 8) goes for a kill. Pitt defeated Syracuse this weekend but then lost to a

-surging Marquette team.

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ’ Writer 1

The Pitt women’s volleyball team had ev-
erything going its way in the ﬁfth set of
Friday’s match against Syracuse, according
to head coach Toby Rens.

0But it didn’t carry over into Sunday’s
game against Marquette.

“I was very pleased with our poise in
the final set [in the Syracuse game],” Rens
said. “We were focused and ready to play
for a win.”

The Panthers (11-15, 5-5 Big East) de-,.,._
feated Syracuse 3-2 on Friday, but were
shut out by Marquette (17—7, 8-2 Big East)
on Sunday.

“I would like to say that we came to play
to win at Marquette, but it seemed like we
were ﬂat,” Rens said.

It’s easy to blame the lack of energy on a
long string of road matches. The Panthers
have played four of their last ﬁve matches

away from the Fitzgerald Field House.

But according to senior setter Alyssa
King, that wasn’t the case.

“We all have a lot of experience playingq
away matches,”_King said. “Personally, I
enjoy being on_the road and feeding off of
a big opposing crowd’s energy.”

The Panthers did succeed in this mental
approach against Syracuse, but saw it fall
apart in the loss to Marquette.

Pitt 3, Syracuse 2

While King considered experience to be
vital when playing on theroad, the younger
members of the Pitt team helped earn the
Panthers their ﬁfth ﬁve-set victory of thee -
season. .

Sophomore outside hitter Alex Phil-
lips recorded a career-high nine kills on
the night, while fellow sophomore Alexa

‘Campbell chipped in seven kills.

v “It was great to see some of our younger
players step up,” said Rens. “Their kill ﬁg-
ures aside, they also helped throw Syracuse
out of system by adding to our offensive
attack.” .

The Panthers lost the ﬁrst and fourth
sets by scores of 25-11 and 25-19, respec-
tively, but came away with 25-22, 25-13%;
and 15-10 victories in the remaining sets
to complete the match win.

For Rens, the most impressive of those
sets was the ﬁfth and ﬁnal one, in which the
Panthers showed “excellent poise.”

“In that ﬁfth set, we earned most of our“.

conferences, but does any other non—BCS
conference have more fans? No.

Pitt, West Virginia, Syracuse and Rut-
gers all have huge fan bases thanks to their
storied pasts. The Mountain West has BYU,
Utah and TCU with big fan bases. But what
does San Diego State or Wyoming bring to
the table? Syracuse has been consistently
awful for a long time, but its fans are still
there and they still travel well. So even the
Big East’s worst teams bring more money
to the BCS than most schools in non—BCS
conferences. '

8. Who would be the resident patsy?
For several years now, the Big East’s au-
tomatic bid has served one purpose: to
provide an easy bowl win for the SEC’s or

the Big East and Cincinnati, who would
Florida have pummeled in the Sugar Bowl
(aka, the Tim Tebow Bowl)? Playing a Big
East team in a BCSjbowl is a nice consola-
tion for teams who can’t quite win their
conferences. '

7. The conference still needs time to
heal. The Big East was doing just ﬁne until
Boston College, Miami and Virginia Tech
stabbed it in the back by jumping ship‘ to
the ACC. The conference had to scramble

Hoping to add another Big East victory to
the weekend, the Panthers traveled to Mil-
waukee to take on Marquette but were met
with resistance by a team that Rens consid-
ers to be playing excellent volleyball.
“The Big East is a tough conference,
but I would say Marquette is at the top
of their game and the Big East as well,”
Rens said. "

Defense thrives in loss

_Golden Eagles easily defeated the Panthers ;

with "set scores of 25-16, 25-7 and 25-18.

Marquette led the match in nearly every
offensivecategory, including kills — Mar-
quette recorded 41 and Pitt just 18.

The Panthers did, however, manage to
out-dig Marquette with strong defense.

“D efensively, I feel that we can play with
anyone,” Rens said. “It was our offensive
attack that held us back.”

Town, often the Panther’s leader in
kills, recorded just four kills in the match.
Senior middle hitter Imani Harper led Pitt
with seven kills, but Marquette’s Ashley
Beyer contributed 14 kills to her team’s
victory.

“We just did not have our feet under us
to start the match,” Rens said. “After that,
it just cascaded in a ripple effect.”

As the Panthers anticipate a return to
action against Louisville and Cincinnati
this weekend at home, Rens will be glad
to be back at Pitt.

“Road trips can deﬁnitely take their
toll on a team,” Rens said. “It will be nice
to get home.” .
