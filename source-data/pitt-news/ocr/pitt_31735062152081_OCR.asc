to"‘ action  taken recently

It was‘ revealed that the publica-

W. Amos,:dean of ‘women; Dr. \"i_n-"
cen_t W. Lanfear, dean of men -; Theo-
dore ~W. Biddle, assistant dean of
men-, and Robert K. Graham, faculty‘
adv’is_er_to University publications and
dir_e_ctor- of the News Service, went
on record as “unanimously disfavor-
ing all _beauty contests at this Uni-;
v'_ersity,"-’ and thus ‘ requested that
Rogaliner discontinue his plans for
the inclusion of a Hall of Beauty sec-
tion in The 1937 Owl.

The meeting was held when Rega-
liner:reques_ted that his ca.se be heard,
after. the-board had, previously ex-.
pressed its disapproval, as a group;
of the plan. Student sentiment,—at
least among the men students of the
University, was heartily in favor oi
the proposed contest in recognition oi
co-edbeauty here.

Rogaliner reported that the earl;:_

expected request that the contest be

would make The 1937 Owl “more

“O -Jupiter! We thy humble servi

ants hail thee, king of gods, and" pro,-

claim our fealty to thee. (Bless this
gathering and grant us thy favor in
all our undertakings.” - .
The Pontifex Maximus (Dr. James
Stinchcomb, acting head of the class.-
ics department, disguised), dignified
and stately in his voluminous robes
of priestly oﬂice, finished his invoca-
tion to Jupiter, sat down, and the
Classical Club’s Roman Banquet, held
last 'I‘hui.'srlay, February 18, at Heinz
House, was on. .’
Toga-clad guests experienced many
unusual occurrences during the course
of the dinner, both in the food and
in entertainment. _ ' Q
For s°.veet—toothe-d lJa11q'.1cte1.'s. the
ﬁrst course contained, in addition 
eggs, olives and lettuce, a concoction
of grapejuice and honey known as
mulsum. Directly <afte1'wa:.'(l.-2, twri
slaves entered, bearing a 1'()ZiIa"fl2_ pig‘,
complete with a garland on its -head
and an apple in-its mouth. Dr. Henry
S. Scribner, professor emeritus of
Greek, deliberately plungeda cz;"1'ving
knife into" the porker,_‘and “aves”
rang out from the assemblage.
Between courses, two wrestlers
struggled to a draw, both accepting
the plaudits of the crowd, and an
“0rpheus" dance was presented, in
which people in jackass heads at-
tempted to scare Orpheus, who calm-
ly continued to strum on her lyre.
The banquet ended with a skit,
“Pandora l’eeks.” ' ‘ '

5 —.-Local universities joined with
groups all over the world to com-
’niemorate the 100th anniversary
of the death of Alexander Pushkin,
‘-the great Russion poet, in a meet-
ing in.the Carnegie Music Hall last
Tuesday. I . 2
‘Boris Brasol, president of the
Pushkin Centennial committee in
-America,- served as the principal
speaker. Russian» music was
played by the members of the mu-
sic department of the Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology and by Dr.
Marshall Bidwell, Carnegie Music
»Hall ‘organist. ' Alexei Tcherkassy.
well-known. Russian baritone, gave.
-several vocal solos, .
Dr. A. Avinoﬂ’, assistant profes-
sor of line arts at the University,
was chairman of the .__~Pi.tts_burgh
committee. :Dr‘. John F. Raschen,
professor of modern language,‘ was
also in the group. '

Soon For Annual Spring 5
Festival, .M:a-rch, 5

 

 

Whether or ‘not there ‘will be a
Mardi G__ras, a razz rag, a high school
day in_ 1937 Spring Festival7Week
are among the decisions, which its
co-chairmen, Kathryn Hardy, C377,
and Louis"B'earer, 'ChE37, ,will be
making -:_in. the next few weeks.- 1}

Under the direction of Miss Hardy
and Bearer the whole spring festival‘
progranrwill be developed. Working
with them will be numerous commit-
tees which they will appoint soon.
Spring Festival week is scheduled for
the week of May 5.

Events" which have become tradi-
tional _are an Interfraternity track
meet, activities Tap Day, .a Sports
dance. a ﬂoat parade, a fraternity
sweepstake race, a ROTC parade.
Last year the Thursday night event
was a Mardi Gras held on the drive
behind‘.-Uumni Hall with leading cam-
pus organizations taking concessions
and setting up booths, and with
spring '-festival street dancing for
everyone. In other years carnivals
wcrc held-in the stadium with cam-
nus activities sponsoring side shows,
mnseuins. bingo and so forth.

Indicati-onps are that the chairmen
favor ‘a bigger and grander Mardi
Gras this year" which might "possibly
be held in the_ street behind Memorial
Hallf " '  '-  '

Meanwhile, Miss Hardy and Bearer '

are looking for-“new ideas‘ to_ incor-
porate intoa “more colossal Spring
Festival than ever before.”

Filled with chirpinghirds, aquari-

butterﬂies and bugs, Room 909,
Cathedral, has taken on a new aspect

the zoology department. It is now
.-.1 nature study room. _

Dr. Samuel B. Williams, professor
of biology, who was responsible‘ for
the room says, “With the present en-
larged facilities we have been able to
fix a" room ‘that affords almost as
practical-' work ‘as that done in— the
lake laboratories.” ‘

.-The Lake‘ Laboratories are at Erie.
Pennsylvania, and Presque Isle in
Lake Erie where courses in biology
are oifered during the summer. Now.

these. courses will be offered at the

The Women’s Glee Club was fornied
in 1916 by members of the School of
Education and was reorganized in
1923. The Women’s Debating Society

was organized in 1921. During these _

years small groups of friendsz,-found
themselves. in self-perpetuating clubs

‘» which in the fall of 1,915 formed the

nuclei for chapters of national‘ soror-
ities. The Panhellenic Society.was or-

next few years, Women’s honoraries,

 appeared in campus.

Individuals Win Prominence.

Individual women have won their
--share of campus honors. Helen Hunt
Foresman designed the standard Pitt
ring, first wornin 1917. Anna ‘Schaab
Robb ‘won the George Wharton'Pepper
prize in 1925, the only woman who
has that distinction._

freshmen started in the fall of 1911,
and developed" into the Hearth Cere-

had its beginnings in 1914; the May

fell into the" Potomac River in 1903,
and Congress, which had been ap-
propriating‘ funds for ‘the experi-
ments, refused to give more money.
The same year the Wright brothers
ﬂew successfully. “Ten years later,”
relates “Uncle Bill” Ludewig, “Glenn
Curtis got Dr. Langley’s plane out
of Smithsonian Institute and ﬂew it.”
Langley died in 1906 without hav-

football, the name
of Gilb ert L.
Welch, class of
’28 comes up.
Welch, in 1927,
was the outstand-
ing running half-
back of the coun-
try. On a Pitt
team which con-
sistently ran up
the score, was §
tied only by W. i
& J. and lost the E... . . .
Rose Bowl game WOODRUFF
to Stanford“'by 7-6, Gibby -was the
offensive inspiration. ,

Welchon two separate occasions re-
turned kickoffs for. ._touchd-owns, one
the longest run ever recorded by a
Panther, 105 yards against West-Vir-
ginia. ' " '

The classic sight of Gibby whizzing
down the sidelines, perilously near
the out-of-bounds mark, yet eluding
tacklers with grace and ease isgan
unforgettable sight, yet it was ex-
pected when Welch was running the

ball for Pitt.
Donchess Rates Second

And second only to Welch must be
placed Joe Donchess, all-American
end for two years, twice participant
in Rose Bowl games, by all reckon-
ing the greatest end ever’ to play for
Pitt. Cool,_ fast"-charging, and‘ quick-
thinking, Donchess was never out-
played, seldom held even.' _

His greatest achievement,'perhaps,
was the day he -ran rings around
Wesley Fesler, versatile Ohio State
athlete and later his running mate on
the al.l-American team, and » was -a
potent“ factor in the Panther’ 18-2
vic'tory.. .

After football, the choices are com-
paratively easy. That Charley Hyatt
was the greatest basketball player
to enroll at Pitt, or for that matter,
at any college, is practically beyond
dispute. It ‘might even be said that
Hyatt “made” Panther basketball.

Twice Led Nation

Charley was consistently the team’s
high scorer during the three years
when the Carlsonmen were “winning
’em all.” In addition, he led the en-
tire country , in points during the
1927-28, and 1928-29 seasons. His
off-nights were few and fa.r between,
and his miraculous shooting from all
angles and ‘under all kinds of pres-
sure make him a court legend here-
abouts. _ _

Second honors must be split be-
tween Don Smithand Claire Cribbs,
two more recent luminaries. ‘Each
attained the all-American honors
which had been Hyatt’s for three con-
secutive years. Each had the facility,
as well as the ability, to inspire un-
beatable fight in their teams, each
was the type of basketball player
coaches dream of ﬁnding, the type
which Dr. Carlson ﬁnds every once
in a while.

Woodruff Or Bowen?

Coming to track, the situation
again becomes involved. There's
hardly any doubt that Johnny Wood-
ruif, present star and probably the
greatest half-miler in the world to-
days deserves somemention.

Yet there were others who can be
mentioned in the same breath'with~
Woodruif. One in particular was Pete
Bowen, Olympic quarter-miler in
1928, and NCAA, AAU and IC4A 440-
yard champion the same year. Bowen
captained Pit-t’s 1929 team, and was
its middle distance star. Those who
know say that for speed and competi-
tive spirit, there is little to choose
between Woodruif and Bowen.

No selective list of all-time greats
can ever be entirely satisfactory to
every reader. But The News has done
the best it can.

when the pool was retiled.

Although plans had been. made to
have a swimming team a year before
the ﬁrst meet was held, practice for
the ﬁrst natators wearing» the blue

and gold was delayed because of the =

remodeling of the Trees Gym pool.
However, when the swimmers re-
turned in September, 1913, they
found everything ready for their first
season of Pitt varsity competition
under Coach Taylor.

They Went Hollywood

These early natators must have had
sex‘ or box office or some other kind
of appeal, since a movie syndicate
took pictures on December 12, 1913,
of the. best of them stroking through
the waters, of the Trees Gym pool.
An excerpt from an-* account of the
affair in the Pitt Weekly said, “Pic-
tures were taken of Sweet with his
sprinting ability, Buckland in his fa-
mous backstroke crawl, passed the
lens like a s-hot; Swope, the human
arrow, took to the water like a ﬁsh;
while Linn did the plunge like a.sub-
marine.” They had real swininiérs
in “them thar days.”

However not all ‘of their time was *

spent in stroking beforet-he camera,
since Navy, the sole opponent onthe
Pitt schedule, was met and defeated.
The following‘ year the Midshipmen
returned the compliment, sinking the
Panthers 36-17.

On the 1916 schedule, the ﬁnal one
before swimming was revived in 1919,
Chicago and Penn were included, and
both defeated. For the three years
during the war the athletic program
was curtailed, with ' only football,
basketball and. track continuing with
regularity, and swimming was one of
the minor sports dropped.

Swimming Resuscitated

In 1919 the water sport was re-
suscitated, with Navy again the lone
opponent on the schedule, and again
the sailors" defeated the Panthers.
However, in 1920, Syracuse, Reus-
selaer, and Johns Hopkins were added
to the schedule and the Pitt splash-
ers defeated all three, although they
continued to lose to the Navy.

It is from these later beginning.-
that the present Pitt swimming team
traces its birth. Although the Navy
has been dropped. from t-he Gold and
Blue water schedule, Delaware, Penn

Dukes in the first ‘ _
"game 51-50.an'd.._by
taking "two from
Jarnegie Tech.

DuqI.1esne,'as in‘ '
the previous game,
had ‘ doubled the
score‘ at the half,
31-10, and Dr.:

substitution tactics
in the ﬁnal sec-
onds of play would .
havenwon out had '*-’ ‘ " ‘ "
the Pitt boys tak-‘C1-11CK"DAV[ES
en time to “get Duke Coach
set” on their sh-ots. _ v

,_ However, the ‘Panthers were over-
anxious to win, and shot widely in
those last few minutes neecling only
one field goal to tieiup the score.

Bonn annexed intlividual honor.»
for the game, but it was »Dresmich’..v
consistent shooting and lV.Ialackney’..-r
floor ‘work that drove the Dukes ta.
victory.

It took both teams some time t(
get moving in last night's .maI:athon
Long John Dremic-11 hit the hoop to
open the scoring for the.evenin-g and
;)y the .end of the ﬁrst session had
sarned himself three more bucket.-;
for a half-time total of eight, two
short of the ‘total for the Pitt quin-
tet.

"D1"-esmich gave the‘ Duke boys the
shooting instinct, a.nd soon all his
mates were ﬁring away. Bonn, who
usually does right by his “snap” .'~5l10l’.,
showed the way but connected for
only two out of eight attempts.

Meanwhile the Carlson scrapped:-.=
showed their usual sloppy ﬁ1'st-half
brand of ball, although Billy Jesko
shot with his [regular accuracy. He
made three out -"of ﬁve field goal at-
tempts on‘ straight. “set” shots.

His mates, however, handled the
ball poorly, showed a tendency for
“steps” an-d tossed the ball out of
bounds with machine-like regularity.

In their last meeting the score
stood proportionately the same at 30-
15 although there were more points
on the Duke side of the ledger. '

Shortly after play was resumed
Kweller fouled Fabel, when the blond
sophomore drove in for a one-handed
push shot at the hoop. Davies sub-
stituted Fortncy for the rangy Duke
regular.

Loucks’ set shot, followed by
short one by Jesko, brought the score
to 28-15, as time was called. Witl:
the count reading 30-16, Garcia, Rad-
vansky, Zeleznick and Johnson re
‘pla.ced.l4"abcl, Spotovick, Rowe and
Loucks.

Garvin‘.-:. protested long shot was
T-:nocl~:oI_l out by Fortney, but inter-
ferciice was ruled by the referee.
bringing the score to 31-21.

Garcia's foul, followed by Radvan
sky’s shove shot, took Pitt within
seven points of the Dukes, the closes:
they had been to Duquesnc since the
tirst six minutes.

Zeleznick’s shot from the lift.
raised the Pitt total to 28-31. Gar-

cia’s foul scored Panther tally num-
ber 29.

With one minute 30 seconds to go
Mi1ler’s foul put the game on ice for

BILLY JESKO
SENIOR basketball star who last "

night played in his final Pitt-
Duquesne game and acquitted him-
self gallantly as «he led "a fighting
Panther team up to within one
point of a great Duke organization.
Watched. like a hawk, -as usual, he
found opportunities enough to
slide out into the open -and drop
in a. few more baskets, guided by
his do-rvdly accurate eye.

Captain Billy Jesko and his mates
passed and cut furiously in the ﬁrst

shooting ﬂurries to trail by only 15-
10 at the half-way mark.

Pitt’s scoring was equally distrib-

"Captain l\'le3«‘e1'» and Johnny Moir,

enough points between them to keep

Celebration

By Karl Stark .
It was 25 years ago. today that the

' University celebrated" its 125th anni-

versary with a program that lasted

. for several days. But the only rec-

ord of that celebration in 1912 is
the ofﬁcial bulletin published by the

I _University following the event.

It started out, the bulletin claims,

' with a student torchlight procession
~-and a bonﬁre on the University cam-
‘ pus. Led by the band, 1,000 students

.with representatives of the different
schools and several hundred alumni
marched in the procession.

“The ﬁrst exercise,” says the bulle-
tin, “was the ceremony of burning
the freshman caps, after which a
snake dance was executed around the
bonﬁre. The usual refreshments were
then served, and after a number of
University songs and selections by the
band, the exercises of the evening
were closed.”

Whatever the “usual refreshments”
Possibly a
birthday cake and a wiener roast over

’ the burning caps, but at any rate the

celebration was a far cry from the
large scale ceremony of today. "
Formal celebration began the next

' day with educational conferences, a

luncheon for delegates, the presenta-
tion of the pageant play, “The Vision
by George
Seibel. Chancellor S. B. McCormick
welcomed some 250 representatives
sent by many European and Ameri-

‘ can universities.

In a cursory manner, Chancellor
McCormick summarized the periods
of the Universi.ty’s history, the ﬁrst
oﬁicial recording we have of more

~' than a century of activity of the in-
; stituti-on. Guest speakers followed the

chancellor, speaking on the ideals of
education, culture, scholarship, effi-

- ciency, and citizenship.

The celebration lasted oﬂicially for
three days in February. Conferences
were held to discuss the “City Uni-
versity” and aspects of education
with reference to educational insti-
tutions.

Exercises, commemorating the
gra'nting”of- the first charter, included
speeches by school officials.

back formed clubs to speak Latin.

French, German, and Greek, no rec-
ord was kept of their functions.

The oldest language club on cam-
pus is the Classical Club, formed in
1905 for students in classical and
scientific Latin and Greek classes.
Originally, the club was composed
mostly of students preparing for

‘medicine and science.

The French Club, which was first
organized in 1911, is active today.
Since its meetings -are conducted in
French, with I‘-‘rench song:-: and
French speakers, the club has been
an aid to students who wish to speak
French.

War Influence

At the same time the French Club
was being organized, a’tt.empts were
made to organize Deutschen Verein,
the German Club. However, a per-
manent club was not formed until
1922, because of World War feeling
Since then it has sponsored presenta-
tion by German students of social
programs, lectures by German schol-
ars on topics of current illteresi,
plays and musical programs.

Several years after the appearance
of the French Club, a printed pro-
gram of the Italian Club was issued.

, In addition to its musical program,.

Dr. S. ‘B. McCormick, Chancellor of
the University at that time, ad-
dresse.d the club on “A Few W ords,"
but since that time there has been an
active Italian Club on campus.

By Richard Weiss

What happens when a University
co-ed complains to a store that the
new gown she bought for the Heart
Hop has been torn already?

The answer is simple enough. One
of the larger downtown stores has
formed a fellowship at Mellon In-
stitute to deal with complaints of that
nature.

Dr. Jules Labarthe, a Senior Indus-
trial Fellow at the Institute, reports
that he receives from ﬁfty to sixty
customer complaints a month. He
finds that the damage in approxi-
mately 80 per cent of the cases is
due to misuse of the article by the
customer.

Dr. Labarthe further explains,
“The primary work .of the fellowship
is the evaluation of merchandise of-
fered to buyers prior to their pur-
chasing it for their custoiners.”

Products of several manufacturers
are sent to the Institute where the
item that proves to be superior
through various chemical and physi-
cal tests is selected. Strength, wash-
ability, and general quality of ma-
terial are determined in the ﬁnal an-
alysis before selection,

A new ﬁeld that was opened up
last year is the actual setting up of

Mrs. Starrett Completes Extensive Historical Research
For Publication Of 500-Page University History
Scheduled To Appear On Campus In June

By Milton G. Lehman, Jr.

All that has been said and done
about the University of Pittsburgh
from the time that Judge Hugh
Henry Brackenridge made his ﬁrst
plea for the chartering of the Acad-
emy in 1786 to the celebration of
150th anniversary this week has been
written.

For 18 months Mrs. Agnes L.
Starrett, Of
English, has been occupied with
ﬁling cases, musty documents, old

assistant professor

letters: the information that has
been collected throughout the city
Uni-

and state relevant to the
versity.

The result Will b.e a 500-page vol-
ume entitled, “Through One Hundred
and Fifty Years: The University of
Pittsburgh,” to be published and pre-
sented to Pittsburgh early this June.
The manuscript, completed this wee]-:,
is now being prepared for Printing-

Commissioned by Chancellor Bow-
man in July, 1935, Mrs. Starrett ob-
tained leave of absence from her
classroom to devote all her time to
writing the history.

The excitement of investigation
and the thrill of ﬁnding new material,
has, Mrs. Starrett indicated, made her
work “a great deal of fun. And the
full cooperation of the students, fac-
ulty, and"per-sonnel of the Univer-
sity has made my research more than
gratifying.

“You know," the historian de-
clared, "if l were to acknowledge
in print all the assistance and help
that has been given to me; Om‘
volume would look much like 3.
t e l e p h o n e directory. People
throughout the City of Pittsburgh
have shown an interest in the book
similar to the interest they have
always shown for their University.

“It has been fine to note the pride
the alumnus reveals when he declares
with pleasure that his grandfather
was graduated from the Academy, his
father from the Western University
and that his son is attending Pitt.
Really, in the course of my investi-
gation I have met most delightful an-d
interesting people.”

According to Mrs. Stvarrett, her
source material has" come from
all parts of the state. The Rever-
end Thomas Pears, through the
library of the Presbyterian Church
in Philadelphia, turned over the
archives of the early Presbyterian
Church to Mrs. Starrett for her
investigation. This material pro-
vided information on the early pro-
fessors of the University, who were
pastors of the church.

The Very Reverend Monsignor
William J. McMullen, rector of the
St. Paul’s Cathedral of Pittsburgh,
offered material on Father Charles
Bonaventure Maguire of the ﬁrst
faculty. John E. McKirdy, who was
graduated from WUP in 1893, pro-
vided biographical material on early
Pittsburgh and the founders of the
University. Mr. McKirdy is an au-
thority on the early history of West-
ern Pennsylvania. A

Through the assistance of Mrs.
Lois Mulkearn, librarian in charge of
the Darlington Room of the Cathedral
Library, and the Historical Society of
Western Pennsylvania, Mrs. Starrett
procured ﬁles of old newspapers of
the late 18th and early 19th centuries
which were of much value in her re-
search. Professor Percival Hunt, head
of the department of English, Mrs.
Starrett declared, has been most
helpful with his literary suggestions.

provided photographs and reproduc-
tions of documents printed in the
histo1‘y.

“Possibly one of my first ac-
knowledgments should he made to
my secretary, Mrs. Doris Shaver
Corbett, whose invaluable and im-
measurable assistance helped to
make possible the publication of
the history,” _'Mrs. Starrett said.
“And then the secretaries in the
various executive offices of the
University, student NYA workers,
and the members of the student
publications were helpful and
obliging.

The oldest document. pertaining to
the history used by  Starrett in
her research was aPittsburgh Gazette
of 1786 which published a plea by
luclge Brackenridge for the establish-
.nent of an “academy of higher learn-
ing for the peoples west of the Alle-
ghenies.” This document has never
been reprinted entirely. A copy of
the original will appear in the text
of her volume.

Included in the book, besides the
history proper, will be an appendix
containing documents such as the
original charter, the charters of
affiliation of the different schools,
old letters, particularly the one
signed by Dr. Francis C. Fhillips, '
predecessor to Dr. Alexander Si!-
verman as head of the department
of chemistry.

“Tliis letter,” M1's-:. Stzn*1‘e'tt ex-
plained, “announces the ﬁrst move-
ment toward co—cducation. Dr. Phil-
lips 1‘cqL1es'l'ed in the writing we liavc
presc1‘ved that young women be ad-
mitted to the department of cl1€:.m-
istry,”

In the last (3lléipl1E'l' of the l1istor;y
Mrs. Starre-tt declares:

“Someone has said that Mark
Ttvaili wept when he Wrote the ﬁnal
chapter of ‘Joan of Arc.’ The last
chapter in the liistory of the Univer-
sity of Pitteb1.n=g.n_, written with far
more feeble pen, draws near its end
And it is not difllcult to rcali.'c.c l.h4._—‘
ngeg-.,=c:t witli which l\lai'k 'l‘\vain parted
from the world in which he had lived
 lon-g———a world of courage and
spiritual assurance in the face of bit
terest human disappointment.

“Tine last chapter in the hi.'=‘tory
of a university, however, is never
written so long as desire for knowl-
edge, love of beauty, and hope for
a better future persist. Universi-
ties» as the expression of these
abiding values, are among the old-
est continuous institutions known
to man. The University at Pitts-
b‘"‘8h has been their expression for
one hundred and fifty years."

Construction Of Commons
Room, Cheering Block,
Called Signiﬁcant

By Bob Adams

Cathedral construction, the death of
a University oflicial. the SFA cheer-
ing bloek project, and the football
tean1’s Rose Bowl victory stand om‘
among signiﬁcant events of the Uni-
versity’s 1936-37 history.

Shipments of Indiana limestone and

Since last September 24, workmen
have been setting stone in the three-
story room, in an effort to complete
stone work in the Commons Room and
its three galleries by this summer.

When completed. the 17 classroom:
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor will include the na-
tionality rooms representing the cul-
tures. of nationalities responsible for
Pittsburgbfs development. The second
ﬂoor rooms will portray the his.to1'j»f

third ﬂoor classrooms will be made
into memorials to individuals who
have made great contributions to the
growth of Pittsburgh.

The death of Dr. Samuel Black Lin-
hart on December 14 marked the loss
to the University of its secretary for
the past 80 years. Dr. Linhart becanxc
secretary of the University in 1905,
and became secretary emeritus on his
retirement last July.

Coming to the W’r.>stc1'11 University

the mood and tempo, and succeeded
in maintaining them throughout the
play.

Charles Blaker, C37, as her hus-
band, James Huckins, the bookkeep-
er-embezzler, portrayed a husband
whose spirit was broken under the
constant hammering of his wife's
more powerful will.

His voice, especially, conveyed the
character of James Huckins; some-
times his actions were a little too
vigo1'ous for the role he played.

Good Characterization

Betty Knop. Ed37, as Effie Throp,
the hypochondriacal sister of Mrs.
Huckins, had the audience with her
most -of the evening, with her care-
ful and able characterization-s. Like
Blaker, her voice in its shrillness con-
veyed the type of person the play-
wright had in mind.

As Eugene Huckins, the s-on of
Mrs. Huckins, Jack Hoeveler, C40,
gave a very sympathetic performance

The first opportunity for Dr. Stew
art to show his mechanical genius was

 preseiitedfby a'sle_d-riding contest-in

‘ art. The contest was to decide which
- sled "would coast...-the; farthest ‘down

the hill near the Stewarthome. .

From reading one of his ‘father’:
books,’ the. youthful engineer _learned
that the ooeﬁicient of friction of iron

ldeas And A Man

TODAY WE PAUSE to pay tribute to __the
thousands of pioneers who have tiled in and
out of the doors of this University for the past
one hundred and fifty years. Some of those
trail-blazers have been quite. ordinary, both in
ideas and the strength to carry out their ideas.
Most" of them have been hardy. It is singular
that the hardiest of them all, now in his 
teenth year of power, is neither ordinary in ideas
not in the strength to carry thernout. He is
little short of a genius. We know him popularly
as a man clothed in myths and usually retiring.
In these days of vigorous controversies, we see
him as" an able leader, a man who stands his
ground, and maneuvers adroitly.

We said that his ideas were not ordinary, that
his strength to see them through. to the ﬁnish
was unlimited. The story is wellknown that ten -
years’ ago this man saw ideas which had been in
early stages of crystalliza_t_ion‘_ for some time
suddenly “get some place.” Pittsburgh, center

' of the iron and steel industry, was to have its

symbol of education in a skyscraper of steel and
stone. The practical would mix with the aes-
thetic. The building would “get some place.”
It was fine. Great‘. And now it is up. The man
started with nothing more than an idea, a Uni-
versity burdened in debt, and the strength to
construct that which he had conceived.

How to start? Who to turn to for aid? There
was a man in Washington who needed a bit of
persuasion. Soon, Frick Acres came into the
University family, ground was broken, and steel
riveters reported. for work. The 1929 disaster
halted progress when pledges were cancelled or
postponed. The tall building was shell-like
for several years.

Then it was only last year that the stoncsetters
picked up their tools, and work was actually re-
sumed. With the shell of a great idea complete,
the work was turned over to the interior de-
signers. Today, interior atmosphere is being
poured into the huge stone and concrete portals.
The tale is far from completion. Perhaps the
last chapter will never be reached.

Some day the world may hail this University’s
present Chancellor as poet, dreamer, builder. . . ;
Today, he plays an important part in the sesqui-
centennial celebration.

catastrophe. The explosion fell smack in the
laps of some 1300 Alumni who have been busily
tucking in their bibs for the Sesquicentennial
Anniversary Banquet for the past two days.

There only appears to be one camp among the
undergraduates. Not one undergraduate can be
found who is not a strong Sutherland supporter.

cold Fall Saturday afternoons. They know too
many of the men who perform for Sutherland
on those Saturdays, respect them, and recognize
Sutherland principles as just about the best in
the land.

He not only develops football players, but
produces men. He teaches a man not to make

and-string line and secondary by bowling over
and smashing down the opposition, trotted back
to his position to receive one of the “old man’s”
typical comments. “That,” he said quietly, “is
the way a fullback should hit the line.”

He commands the same respect at the end of
a ,_mai_i’s four‘ years of competition as he enjoys
the beginning of the man's relationship. He is
always reserved and taciturn, to the A'l1-Ameri-
can and scrub, alike. "And he is respected for it.

Scholastic Recognition

THE place of .the Scholar in the world today is

one typiﬁed -‘by contrasts and contradictions.
For his greater understanding of‘ the reasonsfor
social ‘change, for his additions to the world’s
sum of knowledge, for his tolerance and sym-
pathy, the Scholar is admired. and respected. He
has been impressed, into the service of govern-

ment and business as an. adviser and an aide-d_c- .
camp; his opinions have been sought on a great.

variety of public problems and not infrequently
followed.

However, there is’ another, side to the Scholar's '
place in this world and the attitude of people‘
‘toward him. It ‘is one of contempt and disparage _

merit, a_so-what attitude. It lo_oks;- upon him as
a musty, near-fossilized antiquarian who spends

his mortal hours grubbing in libraries,-" mullin
over minor details of things which have no in-'

terest or point in this too-hasty age." —

Since the greater proportion of students herefr"
at the University come from typical,Amcrican;

middle-class homes, they reﬂect this ambivalent

students who attain distinction in academic pur-

dice against scholarship, against whaitgin a less
crude age, would have been stygmatized as “book
larnin’.”
their courses with a minimum'* of effort receive
the admiration-’of their fellows. “Cutting” is a
practice which commands a certain (amount of
furtive respect.‘ And there is no social disappro-
bation attached ' to students who manage to
achieve failing grades in courses with a suffi-
cient amount of savoir faire.

Needless to say, this mixed attitude has_ no”
basis in fact. The day when the uneducated per?
son by intuition could solve the problems of liv-:-
ing adcquatelyare gone, ifjit ever was here, and-

more and more individuals -ﬁnd themselves in
need of more extensive mental equipment for the
more business of living. The day of sheer com-
mon sense has passed, for common sense appears
increasingly a -last" ‘ refuge of ignorance and
prejudice. ' ;  _

We ought," therefore,-too recognize unequivo-
cally the placepof the scholartoday. Like the

engineer" and the soldier. he has an honored arid;

respected place. By bringing his l{I1E'}‘.F."l‘3fii,Zfi to
bear oi: social pi‘obl.cm_s I W
a more cqiiitablc solution. . .

Scholars’ Day ceremonies today are a recogni-
tion of the value of the scholar today, They -are
apublic recognition of achievements past and to
come.‘ And probably by a repetition of them
year after year, the traditional attitude toward
scholars will be dissipated. .

  Chancellor owmanspaits

NE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO Pitts-
O burgh was a village of five hundred people.
They were mostly Scots, and here “at the edge
of the world they were creating a pattern of life
that was new, a pattern of old-world ways and
customs changed and intensiﬁed by a whole new
set of conditions. Loneliness and poverty, struggle

for food, shelter, and often for life itself against.

the Indians; need of roads, of ﬁnancing, of tools,
of almost evcrything—-here under these conditions
the villagers, whatever their ages, were natural
children in touch with the natural earth. But even

more important as stuﬁ" in the making of the new
pattern was the necessity of thought. Merely to
live in the wilderness required thought. It required
thought with imagination turned swiftly to action.
Thought and action, taken together, became domi-
nant traits in the village. The pattern lived. It
still lives, although free from the conditions that
started it. The tale is history. A

The growth of the pattern, however, becomes
more evident when we realize that these villagers
were here not merely by accident. They were
among the adventurous ones who dared to cross
the mountains with no thought of going back,
and, more than this, they were the ones who saw
that the trackless woods to the west some day
would be opened and that the valleys of Western
Pennsylvania would be dotted with farms. They
saw that the mountains were a barrier, perhaps
forever, between themselves and the East and
that the need in the new land for household arti-
cles and for farm implements might grow almost
beyond telling. They were the ones who. seeing
forward, determined not to settle upon farms.
Rather, with their ingenuity and with their hands,
they would make things.

These villagers, further, were more than makers.
Though they wanted to make money, the more
the better, there was a strain of idealism in them
which had not been lost‘-with their baggage in
the mountains. They knew the Bible. They had
seen cathedral windows and in the windows peo-
ple, as symbols, whom the light came through.
At this far distance from Scotland, culture, good
government, education, and religion appeared to
be about one and the same thing. Boys of Pitts-
burgh and Western Pennsylvania should havea
chance. They should have a chance to become
ministers, if they wanted to, or senators, or gov-
ernors. They should have wisdom; and this meant
that Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania should
have an academy, or a college, or a seminary-—
the words meant about the same thing.

Thought turned to action. On February 28,
1787, one hundred and fifty years ago this com-
ing Sunday, the legislature of the Cominonwcaltli
listened to a petition and then granted a charter
for the Pittsburgh Academy. In that year. also,
it voted 5000 acres of public land to the Academy
as an endowment.

Pittsburgh and the University, then, began to-
gether; and the two grew as one out of a pattern
of-"adventure, of thought, and of action. And now,
afterone hundred ﬁfty years, what, again, is the
forward lopk ?-  . . 

7ELL,  LIVE NOW in a changed west
country. Thejtrackless woods are cut down

The inountains are no longer a barrier. Pittsburgh
and Westerii Peniisylvania comprise about 3,700,-
000 people, who live in the inountaiiis or almost
out of the mountains, scattered over a square of
twenty-six counties. And the future of the square,

let us not forget, willevolvc from the life and“

rnatc-rials in the‘? square. Pittsburgh is Pit-tsburgh:
not Boston or New York. We have our own kinds
of work, climate; hills, prejudices, and aspirations;
and, ‘thought we have much in common with
other states, we have already a distinct, provincial
culture. We are of Scottish, English, Irish, Italian.
Greek, Chinese, Hebrew, Swcdisliand other back-
grounds. We are a fusion not like anything ir
Europe. We are Vvestern. Vile are America. We

V are an individual development in America.

While these physical changes were going or
and people from the ends of the earth were find-
ing herc both work and homes, we, like the rest
of the iiatioii, pinned our faith‘ more and more
upon the pursuit of knowledge. If we know
enough. we can solve the problemm-that was the
idea. And we are aware of what followed, Science
advanced as by magic. Adventure rose in labora-
tories and worlcshopsg mathematics, clicmistry.
pliysics, and medicine reached into vast new ter-
ritories. Out of new knowledge c:iii_ic_ ucw,proc-
esses, new materials, relief from drudgery, relief
from illness and pain, reduction in the costs of
luxuries and of necessities, and wider range of
thought. The world was made into a much more
zomfortablc affair.

Especially did the advance of science ﬁnd appli-
cation in and about Pittsburgh. Steel beams, rails.
angle irons. rods, armor plate. and car wheels‘
glass, brick, caiiiricd goods, and aluminum-—judg<
Brackenridge told more truth than he knew wher-
he wrote about Pittsburgh's becoming a grea‘;
“maiiufactory.” Pittsburgh is the victory of sci-
ence. But there is ‘more than science.-in that vic-
tory. Rich character, developed here in the early

_day, and the richness of the wilderness are in it

k- i 3
- HE IDEA AND THE IDEAL find here a nat-
ural liome. When we comprehend though
the depth or the range of our own natures, when

‘in a rare moment our spiritual capabilities rise in

our minds, our material victory seems neither sc-
big nor so signiﬁcant. No, it is small in that wide
plane through which we may live. On what leve
of life was Shakespeare when.he.wrote the last of
“The Tempest"? The lines are a monument to his
“rapture of soul,” to his comprehension of his
little, umnodernized London. Such comprehension
sets us right as to the relative values of the mate-
rial and of the invisible world.

For all our material headway, are we kinder
today in our judgments of one another? Is gov-
ernment better? Are labor andsocial problem:
easier to solve? Have we better maiiiiers? Is there;
more happiness in our homes, or fullness of life,
or loyalty to inward vision, or beauty of charac-
ter. or joy and inspiration in being alive?

Questions suchas these, more and more are
coming to mind. Over and above industry with its

 

V “do to get 10 inches was to .write it up. And there wasn’t "
suits; on the other, there is an irrational prcju-'

science. invention. and ‘organizatioii. ﬁiey .call‘ for -

comprehension of our spiritual heritage  .

"Today's issue of The News may look back ‘to 1875
when _the first student publication of the University
came into being. Yet this publication was not merely
‘the basis of the tri-.w_eek_ly newspaper, but the founda-
.-1011 of all four University student piiblications.

F Underrthe masthead “The College Journal,” students

mm 1815 to 1882 subscribed and read a publication
composed of news, essays, poetry, and divers bits of
student expression. The Journal was edited by the
various literary clubs on campus which competed each
year for the editorship. 

The Journal was followed by the Peiiiisylvania West-
clern from 1883 to 1-8_88, and the University Courant,
SS8-1910. Like their predecessor, these publications
which were published at Western University of Penn-
sylvania were hybrid literary compilations.

When the school became the University of Pittsburgh
and centered in the_Oakland district, the Courant was
succeeded by The Pitt ‘Weekly, the ﬁrst issue of which
came off the press 111 September, 1910. Frank C,
Stewart, '12, was the ﬁrst editor. '

The Weekly, in its years of infancy, was a four-page
affair, ten inches long, with four columns to the page;
The issues were anything but examples of ‘good journal-
ism and virtually anytype of sto-rywent into the paper.
Advertisements were accepted bv the editors in 1911.
Cartoons were introduced occasibiially, some of which
were drawn by J..G. Quick, present registrar.

Vi hen it was decided to
