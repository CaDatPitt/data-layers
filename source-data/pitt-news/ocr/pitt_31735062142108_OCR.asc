Are Active

Despite the present war sit
uation, the University Wlll
maintain its policy of a bal-
anced activity program for the
student body during the sum-
mer semester.

Theodore W. Biddle, acting dean
of men, has just released the sched-

ule of activities that has been

planned for the summer term.
Most important perhaps, is Mr.
Biddle’s announcement that Men’s
council and the Student-Faculty
association will be active, and will
attempt to deal with the summer
activities problem.

Men’s council has already open-
ed the Men’s lounge and will open
up the book store from June 25th to
30th. The book store will sell books
for individual students, deducting
15 percent of the purchase price
from the amount turned over to the
seller.

Pitt Town meeting, featuring A

aiforum-type discussion, will be
held once a week and will discuss
various important questions of the
day in world and University af-
fairs.

The Owl, University year book,
will be compiling pictures and
write-ups of summer activities. No
senior pictures will be taken, but
special arrangements will be made
to have seniors purchase their copy
_of the Owl.

Present plans call for an Owl sub-
script-ion drive in the fall, but none
during the summer. A limited staff
may force curtailment of whatever
plans have been made for the sum-
mer, but Mr. Biddle would rather
leave it to the students to decide
whether or not any given activity
will survive during the summer.

All band and orchestra units will
be active, these including the Uni-
versity marching band, the ROTC
band, the concert band, and the
University orchestra. These units
are all under the direction of Rob-
ert L. Arthur, counselor of stu-
dent activities and director of the
Pitt bands and orchestra. ’

Particular emphasis will be plac-
ed on freshmen in the YMCA’s sum-
mer schedule of events, although
there will be no Freshman camp
this summer. Tentative plans call
for a freshman day, with most of
the events, such as athletic compe-
tition and various discussions, tak-
ingplace at Trees gym or in the
Tuck Shop. -

In place. of orientation classes,
there will be a more complete pro-
gram headed by upper class coun-
selors, who are not yet apointed.

Glamour has gone from the Tuck
Shop! And that’s not just because
the fairer sex no longer lingers

there either. With the glamour ,

girls went the smooth coke-sipping
——the boys are drinking milk!

Maybe it’s brain food that the
engineers crave, but anythow milk-
shakes hold an unsurpassed ‘_:ad
as the most popular Tuck Shop
drink.

Gone, too, with the females are
the typical “ﬁgure foods.” The
boys won’t_ eat salads and jello.

_ And what is almost too tragic to
mention, the noise, fooling around,
and smoking are replaced by
study. -

Those Pitt engineers must really
have something. How any boy
could prefer milkshakes and study
to pretty- girls and cokes—-well,
ﬁgure it out for yourself. We
couldn’t.

Steel, Coal Production
Show Rise Past Week

There was a drop of 1.5 points in
the index of business activity in the
Pittsburgh. district last week, ac-
cording to Pitt's Bureau of Business
Research. On the other hand, there
were moderate increases in the
volume of industrial production and
trade, the Bureau’s report revealed.

Steel and coal production also
were greater than for the previous
week. Department store sales show-
ed a pronounced increase from the
relatively small volume reported
for the last week of May.

‘ throughout the Cathedral, will be

demonstrated for the beneﬁt of all
faculty members and students this
week. ‘

Dr. John J. Geise, associate pro-
fessor of history and chief air
raid warden of the Cathedral, an-
nounced that the sirens will be
sounded at 12:30 o’clock for the
dismissal of fourth hour classes
tomorrow, Thursday and Friday.

Sirens are located on all the. even-
numbered ﬂoors up to 36, except
for the lower classroom ﬂoors. For
these ﬂoors (ground, ﬁrst, second,
third, and fourth) large sirens have
been installed on the second and in
the ground ﬂoor elevator lobby.
Testing of the system indicates that
these are adequate and can be heard
in all parts of the Cathedral. On
each floor having a siren, the in-
strument is located in the center,
near the central junction o'f the cor-
ridors. V

Dr. Geise also announced the
signals for a- raid or drill. The of-
ﬁcial air raid alarm will be a
series of 15 short blasts of the
sirens. The all-clear signal, indi-
cating the end of a raid _or drill,
will be one long blast.

Although no scheduled drills were
announced, it was emphasized that
everyone should be familiar with
the air raid instructions. Charts,
similar to those already posted in
lower ﬂoor classrooms, have been

placed on all ﬂoors from the ground
to the sixteenth, inclusive.

Dr. Geise warned, however, that
although the sirens would be
sounded this week, the signals will
not indicate a drill, as none has
been scheduled. Use of the sirens
for fourth hour dismissal will be
for the purpose of acquainting stu-
dents with the new air raid warn-
ing system.

With the installation of_ sirens
and further familiarizing of in-
structions on the part of the stu-
dent body, the drill system as now
worked out is conceded to be gen-
erally satisfactory. The only past
drill, which took place May 13, was
more successful than could have
been anticipated, Dr. Geise said.

Meanwhile, Dr. Geise and John
Weber, University secretary, have
been making plans for the city—wide
practice blackout on the evening of
June 25. Plans for the Cathedral
dim-out have already been worked
out, and are subject to change only

58o s...a..... Enroll

For Engineering,

Over three-fourths of the

upperclass_ engineers enrolled

for the second semester of 1941-42 are back, according to Reg- -
istrar J. G. Quick, and over 85 percent of mining students have
already returned for summer study, with more expected to

register later.

A total of "578 students are already under instruction in

the University’s accelerated

"program, this total not includ- «

ing returns from the pre-two
weeks registration, held last Satur-
d3Y- . . .
Pleasantly surprising to Um-
versity registration officials was
the fact that, although only junior
and senior courses were so ar-

ranged as to make summer study ’
practically compulsory, a large .

number of freshmen and sopho-
mores have also registered for
the summer courses.

With a total of 393 students, the '
engineers led the enrollment list. ;
This total represents 76.3 percent §

of the upperclass engineering en-

rollment on campus last semester. '
Broken down class by class, the en- 

rollment ﬁgures are as follows;
Freshman 18
Sophomores . . . . . . . . 97

The School of Mines re.gistration
total is 133, 87 percent of last sem-
ester’s enrollment. This total in-
cludes 18 students registered at
Camp Hamilton, University by-
draulics camp, located at Windber,
Pa. Class by class totals for the
mines students are:

Freshman ........... 4

Sophomore ......... 23

Junior ...........‘.-.. 28

Senior  55
* * *

In addition, and not affecting the
above percentage, 41 chemistry spe-
cial students have registered.‘ This
total of 41 students, according to
Mr. Quick, represents a “substan-
tial percentage” of those chem spe-
cials registered for full time study
at the University.

Rounding out the total, three
seniors in the School of Business
Administration have registered, in
addition to 8 graduate students.

In the School of Law, enroll-
ment shows a 50 percent increase
over last year’s summer session.
Final registration has not yet been
completed, and the totals are not
yet available.

Scliolarsbip  
Fund Set Up

A scholarship fund for Chemistry
special students was presented to
the University on June 1 by Mrs.
Lowy,’ wife of the late Dr. Alex-
ander Lowy.

The fund will supply money for,
scholarships to “worthy and needy
students without reference to creed
or color.”

Mrs.'Lowy presented the money '

to the University to serve as a
memorial to her late husband Dr.
Lowy, who served with the Univer-
sity for over twenty years as a pro-
fessor of organic chemistry. He
died December 25, 1941.

Dr. Lowy was" co-author of a
chemistry text book which is now
in use in more than one hundred
colleges and universities through-
out America.

Dr. Alexander Silverman, profes-
sor and head of the department of
chemistry, said, “In addition to his
knowledge of organic chemistry,
Dr. Lowy must be remembered for
his genial personality and for the
interest that he showed in the stu-
dents.”

Kelly Announces
ROTC _ Plans

F0!‘ Summer

Colonel Edward L. Kelly, profens-'
sor of military science and tactics,-
today announced that the, military:
science department's plans for this 
accelerated programi

semester’s
have been completed.

A re-organization of the corpisfi

will be the most important change.

Instead of last semester's threes?

battalions of six batteries, the

corps will be organized» into one .,

battalion of four batteries.

This semester the seniors will be ,;_ _

the commissioned cadet officers, and

the juniors will serve as cadet ser-.' =
geants. Sophomores will be the ca- —

det corporals.

Throughout June the ROTC is V

operating on a skeleton basis. Af-
ter the end of this month, when the

College courses open, the corps wi-fl _. ‘i

remain under the same organiza-

tion, but it will be considerably in-.

creased in size. ~

ROTC members will wear sum-it

mer khaki uniforms. A ROTC in-
signiavwill be worn on the collars.

The summer uniforms have not all f

been received, but Colonel Kelly in
conﬁdent that they will arive be-
fore the ﬁrst of July.

ing difficulties arise for last sem-
ester's new freshmen, they will be
permitted to take M.S. 3. in place

of M.S. 1. All students, however. A

must have completed M.S. 1, 2, 3,
and 4 before they can be accepted
into the advanced course.

Swimming Coach, Ben Grady, Follows
Family Tradition; Enters U. 5. Navy

There has been a Benjamin
Franklin Grady in the United
States Navy in every war save
the Revolution, so Pitt’s Ben-
jamin Franklin (better known

I , as “Ben”) Grady is merely
keeping the family record intact.
The Pitt swimming coach was in-
ducted into the Navy last week as
a Lieutenant Junior Grade.

Grady will be stationed at An-

napolis for a month of training into f I
the ways of Navy life. He will then -

report to Jacksonville where it will
be his job to instruct young aviat-
ors on under water tactics.

the country. He had just comp" '-
ed his third year as Pitt swim-
ming coach, coming to the Uni-
versity in 1939 to replace Pat Corr

[ who had held the coaching reins
since 1923. .

Grady, a graduate of Michigan,
chalked up the National Collegiate
three meter board championship,
placed for three successive years on
the all-American swimming squad,
and took a runner-up spot in the
Big Ten tussles while at college. In
addition, he was a National AAU
miler.

In his ﬁrst _year at Pitt, Grady
piloted his squad to the Eastern
Collegiate Swimming title. In
1940 and 1941 his team placed sec-
oiid. Grady was responsible for de-
veloping many ﬁne swimmers, in-
cluding Gus Wilde, Herb Cosgrove,
the Lederstein brothers, Al Bea-
con, and Al Slobodian. Divers ‘de-
veloped under his direction were
Dick Ames and Bill Brown.

Grady in his college days was a
superb stunt man and had partici-

pated in many of the Aquacades. In
swimming he could imitate any per-
son, form or style.

Working entirely on his own last
winter, the Pitt swim mentor un-
dertook a study of tests given to
the advanced ROTC boys who are
required to pass certain -tests be-
fore they can receive their com-
missions. Grady set about coaching
the boys for these tests. Under his
skillful tutoring boys who had never
before been able to swim were able
to swim for the required twenty
minutes.

Gus Wilde, one of the greatest
swimmers developed by Grady,
will take over as swimming coach
for the summer semester.

I Evashevski, Assistant Grid
,Mentor, Enlists In Navy

The University of Pittsburgh’s

coaching corps added another mem-
ber to its staff to the armed services
of Uncle Sam when Forrest Eva-
shevski, newly appointed backﬁeld
coach, enlisted in the Navy last Fri-
day morning. Evashevski’s enlist-
ment follows closely on the heels
‘of Ben Grady, veteran Panther
swimming mentor who last month
joined the Navy and was commis-
sioned an ensign some time last
week.

The resignation of the former
Michigan star brings the Pitt
coaching staff down to six mem-
bers. Publicity director Frank
Carver has announced that no one
will be appointed to replace Eva-
shevski and it remains with head
coach Charley Bowser to select
someone from the present gridiron
"fcoaching crew to take over his
"duties.

The appointment of Evashevski
early last March, proved to be
somewhat of a surprise to Pitt fol-
lowers as it marked one of the very
few times that anyone other than a
Pitt graduate had been named to a
coaching position.

Evashevski ﬁrst gained fame in
the football world as captain of the

great 1940 Michigan eleven and .~
it was mainly through his out-_,,,

standing blocking that the Eva-
shevski-Harmon duet became the
most feared combination in the
country.

Following his graduation, Eva-
shevski was appointed head coach
of Hamilton College at Clinton,
New York, and guided his team to
the best season they had in years.
Then a few months after the close
of the football season, the former
Michigan all-American left Hamil-

ton College to become backﬁeld‘
coach at Pitt. >.. _~_

Receiving honors’ and awards are
merely becoming routine work to
Carl Olson, Pitt’s cross-country and
track mentor, these days. Last
weekend at Lincoln, Nebraska, the
site of the 1942 National Track
meet, Carl Olson was elected to the
presidency of the National Track
Coaches’ Association, being elevat-
ed from the Vice-President spot.

A few weeks previous to this,
the genial coach of the Panthers

was lauded by the Pennsylvania '

Association for Health, Physical

Education, and Recreation as be-'

ing one of the country’s outstand-
ing men in the service of the ﬁeld
of physical education.

In addition to these coveted
awards. the University of Pitts-
burgh advanced ROTC corps made
him an honorary member of scab-
bard and Blade. Olson also founded
the Tri-State Track Coaches’ Asso-

ciation, and plays an important part

in the workings of the W.P.I.A.L.
Troubled with the loss of key
men through the draft this year,
Olson failed to place his Blue and
urold aggregation in his usual ﬁrst
or second slot at the annual IC4-A
meet at New York City, but man-
aged _to take a third place with his
anemic squad. '
Olson took both Carter and
Stickel. whom the newspapermen
have dubbed the‘ “bridegroom
twins,” to the CIIC meet at Mil-
waukee, and watched Stickel gain
a triple victory in the 100-yard
dash, the 220-yard dash, and the
.220.')’.a1‘_d low hurdles.

“The Athletic Administration is
more than satisﬁed with the results
of the compulsory athletics pro-
gram for engineers. If some way
can be worked out, the authorities
would like to see the program ap-
plied to all students.” Thus did
Frank Carver, "athletic publicity
head, describe the early success and
possible enlargement of the new
CA program.

It seems that the physical edu-
cation course w-as at ﬁrst advocat-
ed by the faculty of the engineer-
ing school and Dean Holbrook be-

cause of the general physical un- '

ﬁtness of the students of their
school. The athletic department

was called in, and promptly began

the course.

Many universities and colleges
have already adopted the program,
some giving credits, other not, but
Pitt, it is assumed, is the ﬁrst en-
gineering school in the country to
put the pla_n into effect,

Art the present time, the in-
structors are merely giving calis-

and then either a period of mush-

but will continue to occupy this po-
sition even after war, in the opin-
S ion of Dr. E. C. Davis, head of the
Eiepartment of physical education.

“Pointing out the importance of
men in this ﬁeld, Dr. Davis refers
 to the physical educators now be-
ing placed in charge of physical
Lconditioning, recreation, welfare,
. andmorale by the Army, Navy,
marines, and Coast Guard.

1 “The demand for trained person-
nell is increasing,” Dr. Davis add-
Ced. "‘For several years there has
, been a national shortage of trained
physicaltdirectors. But the future
of the ﬁeld looks still brighter.
' Gommissions now planning for post-
:.:war' years are making ample pro-

«{_the people in the United States and
awof the',_entire world.” »

Or. Davis added that “many of
‘these young men will remain in
-the service after the war in order
to? continue this work in our two-
ocean navy and the expanding air
and ground forces which will be
used to keep the peace. The many
positions left by these young men
‘d thegexpandingl physical edu-
”cation_ programs in schools, col-
.le’g'es‘,“and recreational and sports
centers will have to be ﬁlled.”

I  Women are also assured that
;Lthe$:e opportunities are not limited

will be almost entirely of wood.
The side walls of the bay window
will be plastered and are the only
exception to this wooden structure. ‘

The room will be divided into two
sections, a larger part for the stu-
dents and a smaller portion for the
professor. The walls of the larger
part will be of Norwegiari spruce

Pitt Metallurgyi
Department
Gets Fellowship

University of Pittsburgh’s de-
partment of metallurgy has been
awarded the research fellowship of
the Open Hearth committee of the
American Institute of Mining and
Metallurgical Engineers .

The investigation of liquid steel
problems is the purpose of the
research fellowship. The Open
Hearth committee has practically
every steel company in the United
States in its membership.

Pitt's metallurgy laboratories
have been expanded in recent years
so that at the present time practi-
cally all types of research and test-
ing equipment are available for the
fellowship. Steel may be melted.
cast, forged, and rolled in Pitt's
laboratories, but large-scale inves-

tigations in district industrial plants B

will be favored so as to accelerate
application. of research to open
hearth practice, according to Dr."
R. G. Fitterer, head of the metal-
lurgy department. . s

For the past ﬁve years a similar
program was sponsored by the Open
Hearth committee at Massachu-
setts lnstitute of Technology.

Dr. Fitterer has spent many
years of research in the ﬁelds of '
liquid steel. He announced that
problems of strategic and practi- .
cal importance willbe undertaken
at Pitt under the new fellowship.
He said that work on the research
will be started at an early date,
and that several additions to Pitt’s
research stalf are anticipated. ,
