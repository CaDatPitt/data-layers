, THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Men’s Council Decides
To Take Chairmanship
gOf Annual Xmas Dance

By unanimous vote, Men’s Councilhas decided to vol-
unteer to accept the chairmanship of the annual Christmas
Ball. Men’s Council, as a group, would handle the arrange-

‘ments for the dance, which will be held in the Commons
Room on Friday, December 18,
Some doubt was expressed as to ‘the success- of the

dance because of its being held:

on the last day of school before
the Christmas recess. However,

‘f Council concluded that if only
‘ 200 couples attended the affair, it

would be a -ﬁnancial and social
success.

An idea was presented which
would form, a dating service for

the dance. This activity would be.

a service of .Men’s Council to
‘those students whowant to attend
the Christmas Ball but are un-

, able. to ﬁnd a date.

Budget Approval Withheld
_The treasurer reported that a
meeting was‘ scheduled with Dr.

—'rsEWilliam L. Swartzbaugh, Dean of

Students, concerning ﬁnal ap-
proval of the Men’s Council bud-
get. It was learned. that most of
the requested funds would come
from the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, headed by Dr. Swartz-
baugh.

Further revisions of the M.C.
constitution were made. A
clause stating" the number of
members of the previous Men’s
Court was dropped and in its
place a‘ clause ' concerning the
three new Men’s Council sub-

. committees was inserted. Also
included was a statement which
placed the chairmen of these
committees on the Executive
Board. - it

The blazer situation was still
in a state of confusion. Dr.
Swartzbaugh has taken the blame
for not getting official release of
the blazer contract from“ Leftees.”
At present, “Marvin’s” still wants

the contract and “Leftees” wants

to dispose of the 50 to 60 blazers 1'

that they have on hand. Dr. Don-

ald Swarts is now handling the Q:

situation and will endeavor to
ﬁnd a solution to the problem.

Completion of" the building, which will be constructed on
O’Hara St., is expected by late summer of 1960; excavation
of the site has already begun. I

. The garage willpbe erected between the Western Psy-

chiatric Institute and the Sarahé

’ probably be operated by an ex-

perienced garage operator.

In order to reduce on-street
parking by members of the Uni-
versity “family,” the University
has already set up parking lots
on nearly every bit of unused
land, and has in operation a total

-of 18 lots providing off-street

Irish Fall

‘ Clemens Returns Punt for TD,

to Panthers, 28-l3

Cox, Cunningham Lead Attack

‘By TED COLTON
For the second year in a row the Fighting Irish of Notre
Dame have fallen to the Panthers in what can be properly
termed the best ball game the Cats have played all year. The

score was 28-13,

The Panthers had all their fundamentals down pat on
Saturday as good blocking opened holes in the Irish line and

hard tackling kept the Green’s¢

speedy backs intact.

Once again it was the three C’s
who lead the improving Panthers.
Cox, Clements and Cunningham
were the big guns for John Mich-
elosen’s crew as they scored all
the Panthers’ 28 points.

Clemens Scores

A muddy ﬁeld set the stage for
the Panthers’ ﬁfth victory of the
year as the 52,337 wet spectators
witnessed the hard-fought contest.

It was Bob Clemens who

 ””‘-- brought the fans to their feet in
2-’

the ﬁrst quarter when he exe-
cuted the longest scoring play of
the day. '

Taking Bob Scarpitto’s punt on
his own 36, Clemens broke
through a host of Irish tacklers,
picked up ‘key blocks from Bill
Lindner and Larry Vignali and
raced 64-yards for the touchdown.

Cunningham, Cox Star

“Give Lindner and Vignali the

credit,” stated the young sopho-

'— more from West Mifflin. “Lindner

threw the key block which sprung
me loose and Vignali took out the
last man. Then I knew I’d go all
the way,” Clements concluded.
Jumbo Jim Cunningham and
Fred Cox along ‘with Quarter-
back Ivan Toncic were the other
mainstays in the Cats’ offensive
attack. A

Cunningham and Cox picked up
200 of the Cats’ 248 yards rushing.
Cunningham carried the ball 22
times and netted 101 yards while
Cox_ carried 10 times picking up
99 yards for an average of better
than nine yards per carry.

Toncic Throws Blocks

Toncic kept the Irish defense
off balance with good ball hand-
ling_and also threw key blocks

.to spring his backﬁeld men loose.

Cox scored the second touch-
down when he took a pitchout
from- Toncic and raced 44 yards
to pay-dirt. This gave the Cats
a 14-0 lead at half time.

The Irish came back early in
the third quarter when Quarter-
back Don White threw a perfect
strike to Scarpitto who went into
the‘ end zone. The play covered
58 yards. A

It was Cunningham's turn to get’

into the scoring as he went over
twice in the ﬁnal period. One was
a ﬁve°yard smash and the other
was a three yard plunge over the
middle, carrying three men with
him.- ’ "' I

The Irish scored once more
when George Izo entered the
game for the ﬁrst-time in the clos-
ing minutes and led a 72-yard
drive for the touchdown against
the Panthers’ third team.

Spartans Dump Boaters, 2-1 ,1
“‘i”°Jerich Misses Penalty 

By JACK SMITH

_ Before last Saturday’s game with Michigan State the
Panther booters were warned about two men, Cecil Heron
and Eric Streader. As was expected these two men scored

for the Spartans and the Cat’s soccer team lost 2-1. _
The Cats outshot the Spartans as they have many of

scoring opportunitties cost them:

their third defeat this season
gagains ﬁve wins and one tie.
Several times, the ’Spartan’s
goalie was pulled out of position
‘and the ball was loose in front of
the goal mouth. But everytime the
Panthers shot,_ a lid seemed to
cover the goal. ' . ’
Heron, center forward, hit for

the Spartans ﬁrst tally in the ‘
third quarter on a breakaway -

shot. With ﬁve minutes gone in
the fourth quarter the booters tied
the game when Simeon Pestich
scored on a corner kick from Don
Jerich.

State retaliated when with four

’ minutes remaining Streader put

the Spartans out in front to stay

IC4A’s Go Today
In New York

The Panther harriers will be
carrying their hopes of a success-
:ful season into the IC4A’s today
at New York. Coach Carl Rees has
entered a six-man team which
ﬁnished the regular season with a

to 1-5 chart. '

Ron Rush and Bill Hinchberger
lead the team and it is up
to these two boys to carry the
Cats. If they can ﬁnish in the top
20 they will have a good chance
to ﬁnish among the ﬁrst 10 teams.
There are some 65 schools enter-
ed.

Reed Clarke, Bob Stuck, Mickey
Jupina and Don Adams make up
the rest of the sextet. The Panther
freshmen also will enter a full
team for the ﬁrst time in a num-
‘bet of years.

Recs ﬁgures the frosh have a

good chance of capturing the team u

laurels although their season re-
crod is not too impressive.

on a penalty kick. J erich, who had
hit for two of three penalty kicks
earlier in the season, also had a
penalty attempt, but missed.

“I felt we should have won,’?
stated Coach Leo Bemis after the
game. “When you play well and
lose it’s hard to take.”

Sigma Chi Takes
‘Soccer Tourney;
Ping Pong Begins

The inter—fraternity ping pong
league competition will begin to-
night at 6:15. The ﬁrst round of
the single elimination tournament
will be played today and tomor-
row. Six teams will play tonight
at 6:15, 6:45 and 7:15.

The Sigma Chi soccer team
edged out the PiKA team, 1-0,
for the championship. In a con-
solation game, the Delts topped
the Delta Sigs, 3-0. Even though
the PiKA’s placed second in the
soccer eliminations the standings
show them leading with 14 points
in the all-Sport Trophy Competi-
tion.

HALFBACK BOB CLEMENS is seen as he eyes this goal line, early
in the ﬁrst quarter of Saturday’s muddy contest, on a sparkling
64-yard punt return of the Panther, 28-13 victory.
