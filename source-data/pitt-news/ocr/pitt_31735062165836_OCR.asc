Split Your Ticlreti

 

The candidates for president and vice-president of Stu-

dent Government are in the process of terminating their
mildly interesting campaigns. Each has presented a sum-
mary of. objectives and attitudes concerning the ofﬁces.

which appear on this page.

After weighting their statements, as well as their entire
,.._-_{ platforms and past experiences, The Pitt News believes
" that, despite the similarities and flaws in all the candidates,
Peter Bijur is best qualiﬁed for the position of president,
and Carroll “Gussie” Smith is ‘the best choice for the

number two spot. .

Bijur is quick-tempered where Martin Landy is ‘medi-
tative. He appears very forward and personable while his
opponent is reserved and quiet. When asked his View on the

proposed additional parking

meters, for example, Landy

hesitatingly shadow-boxed, ﬁnally stating “. . . If we can

thoroughly investigate this

proposal and present well-

” ’ thought out objections and modiﬁcations, City Council will

2

listen.”

Bijur expressed the same ‘thought’ but with an imme-
diate indication of his typical force and_ animation: “I’m
completely againstthe plan of the City. It’s Student Gov-
ernment’s responsibility to stand up for this student pro-
test. I would certainlywork with every student organiza-
tion that is interested . . . to petition the City Council, to
~— zrkwrite letters to-the editor of The Pitts_burg_h Press, every-
thing to show a concerted student action.”

Bijur’s long involvement with the parking problem
will aid him in channeling the needed action of ‘SG against

the proposed meters.

In addition, discussing the'Administration’s inﬂuence
on ‘SG, Landy. sho"wed concern about doing things. “tact-
fully” while Bijur said that he was “not worried” about

_ this, expressing conﬁdence in his own plans. .

This .conﬁde,nce is also seen in that Bijur chose to cam-
paign independently, rather. than lean on the artiﬁcial
crutch of the “political party-.”. He appears much more in-:

terested in students thanlin

other/hand, was quick to form a party and has spent more .

organizations. Landy, on the

time discussing itjand various ‘committees. inthe abstract
sense than he has the student himself. ,

Miss Smith. was pressed to join the Able party’be-
_ cause she was almost totally unknown. She has stated,
5“‘..’. however, that she believes sheiconuld work quite well with
Bijur and, therefore, is independent in spirit. .She has
also shown -herself to be of Bijur’s dynamic, animated ilk.

For these reasons, it is felt that SG, /which for-the ﬁrst; ‘
time in a long while hasshown that it can be a forceful’

organization, would be best «guided if the majority of the
voters “split their tickets” in favor of Peter Bijur and

Carroll Smith.

In a discussion of protesting the
possibility of the city placing

“this year’s Student’ Govern-

S G Committee Helps
Admissions Program

By NANCY FUCHS

The Undergraduate Schools Committee has enlisted the
support of 55 students, reported co-chairman Beverly Reit-
man, at Thursday’s Student Government meeting.

The committee has received the names of 600 students
admitted to next year’s Freshman class from the admissions
oﬁice. Each member will write to about ten prospective

freshmen in their home areas to¢

familia1'ize them with the Uni-
versity.
Pilot Program

According to Joel Patrick, the
other co—chairman, “This is a

pilot program to see if we can
get enough student interest with
enough power to sell the Uni-
versity to high-ranking high
school seniors. We are going to
contact them before Pitt Pre-
view to get as many as possible
to come. With a large committee
we hope to work with alumni
in sponsoring programs for ‘in-
coming freshmen in our home
areas.”

Evarard Pinneo, dean of ad-
missions, feels that “this is one

of the ﬁnest things I have seen
in my years here. Our own.
studentsare our best sales-
men.”

He explained that there is a
national decline in the 18 year

old population ‘and that the tidal
wave- of students will not begin
until September, 1964. “The‘ad—'
mission situation is fairly open.
There is keen competition among
colleges for able students,” Pin-
neo concluded.
Library Hours

The circulation and reserve
rooms of the library will be open
until 10 p.m. Sunday night, an-
nounced Joanne Janos, chairman
of the SG library committee. “The
old library hours will be resumed

_on week nights, including Friday,

because three trial periods of ex-
tended hours in three different
trimesters have proved ineffec-
tive,” she continued.

According to Miss, Janos, the
head librarian, Lorena
Garloch, explained that the li-
brary will have extended hours
during periods when the library
is needed most. She estimates
that “term paper time” will be-
gin around March 18, so for an
indeﬁnite period around that
time, the library hours will be
extended to accommodate the
studen_ts.

The reference room is not open
Sunday nights and will not be
open during the extended hours

in the future because professional
help, which is very expensive,
is necessary to staff it. Students
may, however, request books from
the reference room at the circula-
tionrdesk, and a page will bring
them. If there is a deﬁnite need

RING

A diamond white-gold en-
gagement ring was lost last
Tuesday somewhere in the vi-
einty of the Cathedral. The ﬁnd-
er of the ring is asked to call
Rose at Mayflower 1-3500, ext.
513. A reward will be given for
the return of the ring.

for books like the Readev-’s
Guide, they will be kept in the
circulation room when the refer-
ence room is not open.
According to Miss Garloch the
open stacks are not open after 9
p.m. for sccurity reasons. Many
books and equipment have been
stolen from the library in the past.
President Tom Olofson an-
nounced that students have asked
SG to look into the problem of
having men students in wheel
chairs live in Holland Hall, the
only men’s dorm open during the
spring trimester. The corridors
of Holland Hall are to narrow
for the wheelchairs. He promised
to discuss the matter with Jerry
Whalen, director of men’s housing.

One-Act Plays on Greek Theme

 French Dramas Set.

LEADING MAN OF PLAY “Orphee”,

—- Pitt News Photo-
Bernard Verley, with the

author, Jean Cocteau. The one-acttragedy opens this Sunday.

By TED DRIESCH

5*)’

“Le Treteau de Paris”, a professional French .acting

company, will present two contemporary French plays Sun-

day at 8:30 p.m. in Stephen F0

ster Memorial.

Both “Orphee,” a one—act tragedy by Jean Cocteau, and
L ‘fL’Apo1lon de Be1lac”, a one-act comedy by Jean Giraudoux,
are based on classical Greek themes.

In _“Orphee_.” Cocteau states an$
attempt “to open the door to non-
conformist plays, ‘which really
“’*Z’should not appear for many

“years.” By the descent of Orpheus
into death and back to reality,
Cocteau demonstrates the poet’s
creativeerole and’his relation to.
death. He tries ' to “imitate a
world, of reality of which our
world‘ is merely an intuition.”

In “L’Apollon de Bellac,”
'Giraudoux shows a young girl,

Agnes, learning. from Monsieur‘
de Bellac that she can win_men
by flattery. Giraudoux uses this
creative lie of mystery and love
to show that dreams and yearn-
ings are the reasons for the‘
existence of men and women. 4

Edouard Morot—Sir, director for
the French‘ Embassy Cultural Ser-
vices, noted that these plays “pre-
sent two writers of the same
generation; both returning to the
Greek sources; but with neither
the same inspiration, nor the
-same talent.”

Flight from Reality

Dr. Jack Kolbert,’.chairman of

the University’s Romance. Lan-
guages Department, said that
“The playsiof Cocteau and Girau-
doux represent one of the most
important aspects of modern
French literature, namely the
ﬂight from reality and the seek-
ing of the fanciful.” .

Choral Festivali Set
For Carnegie Hall

The music groups from "eight
surrounding colleges and univer-
sities will perform at the" Inter-
collegiate Choral Festival onlFri-

day, at 8:15 p.m. ‘in Carnegie

Music Hall.
According to Emanuel Rubin,

'director of the Men’s Glee Club,

“The purpose of this program is to
g i v e various extracurricular or-
ganizations a chance to meet both
musically and socially.”

-Other Groups

In addition to the Men’s Glee

Club and Women’s Choral from
the University, music groups from
Allegheny, Betheny, -C h_ a t h a In,
Mount Mercy, St. Vincent’s, and
Washington and Jefferson are per-
forming.

Each group will present a
short program of about ten min-
utes in length. According to
Rubin, _.“Various types of songs
will "be sung and because each
group consists of either all men
or all women, there will be
joint numbers at the beginning
and the end of the program.
Also, our group has the distinc-
tion of having Dr. Richard
Camp, director of the Pitts--
burgh Opera Company, to direct
the two mass numbers at the
beginning and end.”

The opening number will be
“Turn Back 0 Man” by Gustav
Holst and the concluding choral
will be “Ah Lord Thy Dear Sweet
Angel Led” from Bach’s St. John
Passion. All numbers will be ac-
companied by the organ.

First Idea

The idea for an intercollegiate
music ._festival was ﬁrst present-
ed last year by the Pitt Glee Club.
Representatives from the various
groups have had several meetings
and have decided to form an or-
ganization “to perpetuate a tradi-
tion of music festivals.”

This year Ron Davis from the
Men’s Glee Club was elected
president. A full slate of officers
has been elected for next year.
They are: president, Bonnie Voj-

tek from Mount Mercy; secre-
tary, Gail Gloom from Chat-

’ ception to our national habit of

It was noon when I guided my car over to the
curb and ‘parked it. I felt" a little uneasy about
having to park directly beneath a sign that read:

NO PARKING
8 A.M. T0 6 P.M.

I park along this stretch of sidewalk‘ every day

but my conscience is more at
ease ﬁve parking-spaces further
away from the much—ma]igned
sign.

There is never a parking tag
on my car_ after I leave school
and it is an ideal spot. V

This has set my ‘mind in mo-
tion. I don’t think I am any ex-

shrugging off small prohibitions.
I have also been thinking about
all the squawking that’s going on
about installing more parking meters on campus.
How Effective? _ V

I, wonder how effective they ‘will be, and how
many people ignore the ‘parking meters that have
already been installed on local sidewalks.

I have always been a big fan of ‘George Gallop,

’ and so I decided to conduct a little poll with the

impersonalmeters. There are 40.such meters lining
the street in front of the Honus Wagner statue in

Schenley Park. On this particularday 32 of them‘

were seeing red because prospective clients had
failed to insert the proper coin while they parked
there..l ‘ -

I walked up Bigelow beside the Cathedral of
Learning. Cars formed a natural boundary—a steel
wlall — for those wishing to cross the street. There
were eight cars parked on yellow lines and.I also

noted that there were seven out-of-state cars park- '

ed there. _  _

The Pittsburgh Athletic Association has four
meters on its Fifth Avenue side. There were three

and it had only six minutes left —— enough to carry
it through the weekend.

Along side the P.A.A. on Lytton Street ﬁve of
seven carswere parked illegally. On the remainder
of the street only two of 17 meters were properly

‘used.

About this time I became the object of some
questioning stares, I’d walk up a street, turn
around, and .come back in the same direction. “Poor
boy must be lost,” they might have said.

On the stretch of Bigelow Boulevard between
O’Hara Street and Fifth Avenue there were 18 out
of 33 meters in proper use. There were four out
of seven “violations on O’Hara in the rear of the
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. In the front
of the building on Fifth Avenue only one driver
in 11 pays. . _

Three out of ﬁve bothered to insert a coin in
front of the Student Union on Fifth Avenue. Then
there were three cars parked, on a yellow line and
seven of eight cars v_vere parked in front of th

seven meters didn’t collect fare, in front of the First
United Presbyterian Church.‘ The best rate all day
was on Fifth Avenue in front of Frick Grade School.
Only one person — probably a teacher —- failed to
pay out of eight.’ I surmised that there isn’t a
touch of larceny in grade school kids.

On South Bouquet Street a young man was
about to insert a coin in a meter when an older
man cautioned him: “Don’t waste your} money,
sonny,” the said. “There’s red tags all along this
street. No one checks them.” _ .

I didn’t want to keep at this pastime until I was
an old man, cautioning youngsters at every meter,
so I returned.‘ to the Student Union. I wondered
why they wanted to put more meters. on the
campus.

Purpose of Able Party

Clarified by Senator

Editor, The Pitt News:
As a present senator from the

founder of the Able Party, I feel
that it is my duty to clarify the
exact purpose for the formation
of this party.

At last count, 33 students
‘were running for senatorial posi-
tions‘ in the school of Liberal

Arts alone. It would be virtually
impossible for a student to know
the qualiﬁcations of all of these
candidates.

rected, the SG elections would
have become a popularity poll

The Able Party has putup 3]
candidates for SG positions
Each one of these party mem
bers has been selected on hi-.
capacity—-not popularity.

Of the 21 candidates selected
to run on the Able Party ticket,

These 15 candidates have par-
ticipated in 37 important SG
projects and committees.

Some of the other organized
student activities in which these
candidates have participated
are: The Pitt News, Pitt Politi-
cal Forum, William Pitt Debat-
ing Union, Student Union Com-
mittees, Student Dramatics, In-
ter-Fraternity Council, Engi-
neering and Mines Bulletin, AS!’
sociated Women S t u d e n t s ,
Marching Band, Internajional
Relations Club, Varsity Ath-
and Engineering and

outstanding leadership, ‘scholar-
ship, and special interests. The

, accumulatedquality point aver-

age for these 21 students is
over 3.1.

I believe that -I have shown.
that the Able Party is not a
group of students running for
ofﬁces “where personalities be-
come more important than in-
dividual accomplishments.” The
Able Party is a group of fel-
low students interested ir. keep-
ing and improving the student’s

Political Parties Not

Harmful, Senior Says

“ditor, The Pitt News:
As an independent observer

' Jf the Student~Government cam-

paign, I am concerned with the
accusations which have been
leveled at the Able Party in a
etter to the editor (Feb. 27).
Mr. Seiger, Student Govern-
.nent Senator, suggests that the
party can exist for only two pur-
poses. The first is the promotion

of “personality-centered poli-

ticking” after the campaign ‘in
the operation of Student Gov-
crnment.

However, in looking at the
record, we ﬁnd that this has not
happened in past elections. Last
year is a case in point.

Parties have clearly served the
function of clarifying and de-
ﬁning issues prior to the elec-
tions, and have not subsequently
interfered in the workings of
Student Government. '

I

‘danger of the .Able Party be-
coming a “personality—centered
machine”. when one of its ex-
press purposes is to draw‘ more
students from the. professional
schools and general student into

active participation in Student"

Government?
Secondly, it is contended that
. the party merely permits a
group of students, _some of
'whom ‘are unqualified, to band
together and push tlreir own
election. In looking over the
achievement records of those
running, I am at a loss to iden-
tify those “unqualiﬁed” indivi-
duals.
I, too, hope that every stu-
‘ dent will examine the record of

each candidate, and will vote on
the basis‘ of qualiﬁcations, not
on the basis of unproven accu-
sations against the very concept
of a student party.

Buber Biography

Found Inaccurate
' Editor,‘ The Pitt News:

May I choose this way to cor-
rect some mistaken impres-
sions your readers must "have
received from your announce-
ment on the Martin Buber lec-
ture on the front page of your
Feb 20 issue.

Martin Buber‘ is not a Ger-
man and would probably per-
sonally resent this insinuation

very much. He is an Israeli who I

has been in Jerusalem since
the late thirties and is not even
of German Jewish extraction.

He was born" in Vienna, Aus-
tria and had a family in P0-
land. That he lived ‘for quite
some time in Germany is be-
side the point.

He is also not a leader of the
Hassidicmovement. True, he is
one of the most knowledgable

and has made a life time study
[ of the Hassidic movement.
However, intrinsically,’ the
I-Iassidic movement ’ is a very
special religious-branch _of Ju-
daism to whose tenets Martin

Buber does not personally sub-
scribe, nor does he belong in
any sense of -the word to the
leadership circles of Hassidim.

 Keep Window Open-Colodny

25')”

 

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

Spirited applause followed
an instant of thoughtful
silence as Dr. Robert Colodny,
associate professor of history
and the social sciences, told
approximately 275 listeners

that some way must be found to
unite the inquiry into the nature
of the universe with the inquiry
into the nature of man. «

“All windows are open to us,”
asserted Dr. Colodny. “We must
not ban any ideas. We might close
off the window opening onto the
avenue of escape from the threat
of terror without an end.”

Background of Prices

Dr. Colodny, speaking on the
“Background of Prices” at the ﬁrst
lecture of the “Last Lecture” Ser-
ies sponsored by. the Student
Union Board Tuesday at 3 p.m.,
gave those attending a needed and
thought—provoking jolt.

“We are all children of one
universal age of terror,” declar-
ed Dr. Colodny, going on to ex-
plain that we are so dulled by
this fact being suspended over

‘ humanity that we have come to

believe that “this is the normal .

condition of mankind.

“I wish to inquire why, in this
age above all others, life is reduc-
ed to a chance equation,” Dr.
Colodny said after observing that
“after four billion years the crea-
tion of eons hangs poised on the

decisions of certain fallable hu-
man beings.” . '
Europe Falls to Pieces
Dr. Colodny warned his audi-
ence that as the “secrets of nu-
clear physics were being to un-
unravel” the rise to power of Hit-
le'.- caused the “frail democratic
structure of Europe to fall to
pieces. _
“We live in an age,” be ob-‘
I "served, “in which an immense
explosion in scientiﬁc develop-

have been changed.

ment and insight was matched
In humanity by a catastrophic
drop. We unravel the secrets of
science, but never learn how to
live together as denizens of one
planet.”

One statement he made sound-
ed almost ominous. “We are,” ob-
served Dr. Colodny, “a malevolent
fungus destroying the balance that
it has taken nature four billion
years to produce.”- ‘

Missing Bridge

He later said_ that “there is a
missing bridge between the philo-
sophy of nature and the philoso-
phy of man. It is never too late
to build this bridge. The philoso-
phy of nature is a clue to the phil-
osophy of man and the, creation of
planetary society.”

Stating that the “real” issues
are rarely ‘ever raised,” Dr.
Colodny admonished his audi-
ence to learn “who, they are,
from’ whence they come, and
where they might go.” A _

During the question period, Dr.
Colodny pointed out that “if Uni-
versity students were to wake. up
and see their responsibilities to

the unborn children and take 'ac- ~

tion now, the next generation
would not ‘have to face this prob-
lem.”

He later said that no one ought
to try to determine the truth or

fafsity of ideas. “If you cut off one,

then .you also cut off the other.
There is no alternative other than
unlimited freedom.”

All but two of the indoor

broken Saturday as ,Notre

"Dame lashed the Panthers

with a 56-35 setback.

The Irish won seven of the
11 events, including a" sweep of
the 50-yard high hurdles and .a
win in [the two-mile relay.‘ Coach
Carl Rees’ top‘ hurdlers — Joe
Friend and Jack Whiteford —- did
not complete in the event. Friend
pulled up short in the 600-yard
run when he suffered a cramp‘ in
a leg he was already nursing. .

John Mulrooney set the new
mark in the hurdles with ‘a 
clocking. The new’ standard for
the two-mile relay is 8:06.5.

Good High Jump

The thin-clads from South Bend

also shattered records in the high

-‘ jump and the mile. Pete White-

house, utilizing a short three-step

' approach,‘ whipped over the cross-
' bar at 6-foot-5. Frank "Carver
. (not the athletic director) and
;. Bill Clark held hands crossing the

ﬁnish line in the mile in 4:22.8.
John Bailey of Pitt ﬁnished in
a dead-heat with Notre Dame’s
Bill Yaley in 9:3l.5, another
record-setting time. The Pan-‘
ther mile-relay quartet won in
the record time of ‘3:24.5 as
Mike Slutsky. Bill DelVechio,
Bob Buell and Vance Carter

Attendance has been wan-

, swimming team has been get-

their Well-deﬁned 68-2-7 vic-
tory margin over Notre Dame
before a crowd of about 600 Sat-

‘Sophomore Tom Ribarchak set
a new record of 50 seconds, flat in
the 100-yard freestyle, shattering‘
the varsity mark of 51.3 that he

-Roby Culhane of Notre Dame
set a new pool and Notre -Dame

records in the 500-yard freestyle‘

unbeaten log at home. -- M
“They were the toughest team -
/we’ve faced all year,” said Irish
coach Dennis Stark. “Purdue
had more individual stars, but
they couldn’t come up with the
second 7'man. This 3 "team has
more balance.” ' '
Balance was I evident when
Coach Gen 'Grady.,.began inserting
new faces’ in the line-up "after
jumping off to a 23-2. lead and

ner as he also flailed honfe ﬁrst .

HAIL TO THE DEAN!

Today let us examine that much maligned, widely misunderb
stood, grossly overworked, wholly dedicated campus figure—
the dean. “

_The dean (from the Latin Deanere—to expel) is not, as many
think,’ primarily a disciplinary oﬂicer. He is a counselor and
guide, a haven and refuge for the troubled student. The dea.n
‘(from the Greek Deanos—to skewer) is characterized chiefly by
sympathy, wisdom, patience, forbearance, and a fondness for

 

homely pleasures like community singing, farina, spelldowns, .

and Marlboro Cigarettes. The dean (from the German Demigo-
macht——to poop a party) is fond of Marlboros for the same
reason that all men of good will are fond of Marlboros—because
Marlboro is an honest cigarette. Those good Marlboro tobaccos

are honestly good, honestly aged to the peak of perfection, hon- .

estly blended for the best of all possible ﬂavors. Marlboro
honestly comesin two different containers'—a soft pack which
is honestly soft and a Flip-Top box which honestly ﬂips. You
too will ﬂip when next you try an honest Marlboro, which, one
honestly hopes, will be soon.

 ‘=-.-~. /2

\ :,

  if/or Z? 7/0557 drya 1'//it/fci/2

But I digress. We were learning how a dean helps poor,‘.
troubled undergraduates. To illustrate, let us take a typical
case from the ﬁles of Dean S . . . . . . of— the University of Y. . . ..
(Oh, why be so mysterious? The dean’s name is Slgafoos and
the University is Yutah.)

Wise, kindly Dean Sigafoos was visited one day by a fresh-
man named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to
marry one Emma Blenheim, his dormitory laundress. To the
dean the marriage seemed ill-advised, for Walter was only 18
years old and Emma was 91. Walter agreed with the dean, but
said ‘he felt obligated to go through with it because Emma had
invested her life savings in a transparent rainhood to protect
her from the mist at Niagara Falls, where they planned to spend
their honeymoon. If Walter called off the wedding, what use
would the poor woman possibly have for a rainhood in Yutah?
The wise, kindly dean pondered brieﬂy and came up with a.
brilliant answer: let Walter punch holes in the back of Emma/s
steam iron. With steam billowing back at the old lady, she
would ﬁnd a rainhood very useful—-possibly even essential.

Whimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean’s Phi

, Beta Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice——and

the results, I am pleased to report, were madly successful!
Today Emma is a happy woman——singing lustily, wearing

her rainhood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes

—twice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter

' . . . And what of Walter? He is happy too. Freed from his un-

wanted liaison with Emma, he married a girl much nearer his
own age——Agnes Yucca, 72. Walter is now the proud father-
stcpfather, to be perfectly accurate-of three ﬁne, healthy
boys from Agnes’s first marriage——Everett, 38; Wilhelm, 43;"

and Irving, 55-and when Walter puts the boys on a lead and '

takes them for a stroll in the park on Sunday afternoon,‘you
may be sure there is not a dry eye in Yutah.

And Dean Sigafoos? He tooiis happy—happy to spend long,
tiring hours in his little office, giving counsel without stint and
without complaint, doing his bit to set the young, uncertain
feet of his charges on the path to a brighter tomorrow.

We don t say Marlboro is the dean of ﬁlter cigarettes, but
we’re sure it’s at the head of the class. Get some soon—-

‘All the King». Men.’

By MARILYN EIGES v

Utilizing experimental tech-
niques of staging and top dramatic
ability, the University -Theater
presented an’ intellectualy stim-
ulating and dramatically exciting,
though often difficult’ to’ follow,
production of Robert Penn War-
ren’s “All the King’s Men” last
week.

The major portion of the dra-
matic success was due to Frank
Maraden’s superb portrayal of
Willie Stark. »Maraden conveyed
fully the combined elements of
tenderness and cruelty which
clashed within Willie Stark, the
“Politician.” ,Maraden is to be
congratulated for one of the ﬁnest
acting jobs this year in a Uni-
versity production.

Intellectual Pincushion

The technique of presentation of
the play tended to use the mind
as an‘ intellectual pincushion. The
viewer was never allowed to be-
come absorbed in the emotional
action. Rather, _he was forced at
intervals to detach himself and
consider the questions raised by
the play. _

The main tosseryof intellectual
darts. ;:WaS the commentator,
playedfby Bob Sestili. It was
also the almost constant pres-
ence of the commentator on the
Stage .which gave continuity to
the action. Sestili gave a strong
performance.

Humor was ‘added with Nelson
Zane Eisman’s'. delightful char-

acature of the fumbling, bumbling,
but crooked at heart, Duffy.
Excellent Portrayal

‘ Jay Christopher gave an excel-
lent portrayal of Jack Burden. He
delivers prose in abeautiful man-
ner,- outdone only by his handling
of cynicism. His only weak mo-
ments occurred in the romantic
situations.

Janice Cimberg was expert as
Sadie Burke, Stark’s girl Friday
and every other day. ’ _

Drama was alternately high-
lighted by lights, which drew the
observers into the action, and de-

stroyed by probing questions from

the commentator and open curtain

scene changing which threw them
back into reality.

‘When. supplemented by action

occuring in a series of ﬂashbacks .

with no immediate understandable
order, the total effect is extremely
difficult to grasp. Rather, the
viewer is pushed and pulled and
prodded ‘until he is drawn to
scrutiny of issues, instead of into
the “play” which is by "deﬁnition
an unreal event.

The only deviation from the
effectiveness of this technique was
the distraction of slides projected
far above the viewer’s eye-level.

Many in the audience missed them -

entirely.
