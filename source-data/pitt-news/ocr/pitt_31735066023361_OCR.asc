$50 million capital fund raising

campaign, scheduled to begin in_

early 1980, at a monthly meeting of
the University Senate.

An amendment to SALT II
that halts further development
of nuclear weapons has been
proposed ‘by Senator‘ Mark
Hatﬁeld of Oregon.

The amendment would
“mutually prohibit further
testing,’ development, or de-

weapons systems not already
deployed,” Hatﬁeld said rec-
ently in‘ testimony before the
Foreign’ Relations Committee.

understand how SALT II “can
-be heralded as a signiﬁcant
step in arms control since it
“allows the arms race to
continue and accelerate.”
Under the terms of SALT II,
the rate. of U.S. strategic
nuclear bomb production will
more than double, while Soviet
warhead production will like-
wise, he added.
Not only will SALT ‘II allow
for increased production of
nuclear weapons, Hatfield
‘said, but it will also allow the
U.S. and the Soviet Union to
make signiﬁcant “qualitative
leaps” in the arms race.‘
With the new generation of
missiles allowed under SALT
11, both sides can deploy
weapons capable of a ﬁrst
strike. Hatﬁeld said as this
occurs “the actual use of
nuclear weapons becomes all
the more likely. Nuclear war is
put on a hair trigger. -
“For_either side to continue
adding to its arsenal is
fruitless, meaningless and ir-

 i0'tl0nS of being

ahead or behind B’...
competition for greater global
overkill are without‘ sanity or
worth,” Hatﬁeld said.

He said that the potential
kill-power of the U.S. nuclear
arsenal alone is sufﬁcient to
destroy all humanity a. dozen
times. '

Richard Cottom, aprofessor.

(Sr, of Political Science at Pitt, said

that there is a strong school of
thought favoring Hatfield’s
stand on the arms race.

ation in the production of

‘chief executives of corporations to
donate funds for university pro-
grams, according to Posvar.

At the Senate meeting Friday,
Posvar said the funds will be used
in the following categories:

—Interdiscipinary Initiatives:
Thresholds in Applied Sciences
($4.9 million) This category in-
cludes neurosciences, biomedical,
engineering, pharmacology ”and
synthesis of chemotherapeutic
agents, energy sources and envi-
roment, human learning and
intelligence, and surface sciences;

—Interdiscipinary Initiatives:
Frontiers in Applied Social Science

something left worth ‘saving

after they are used, Cottam

said. _ . »

“I believe that if there is a
nuclear war, the ‘civilizations of
the countries‘ will be destroy-~
ed,” he said.

Cottom said that the Ameri-
can public can’t understand
“the whole concept’ ofjwhati .
nuclear war involves,” and are "
more easily swayed by hawkish
politic-ians like «Sen. Henry

‘Jackson (D-Washington) who
advocate increased weapons
production. ' t

“It was always understood
that the objective was sufﬁ-
ciency and deterrence,”
Cottom said ofthe develop-
ment of_ nuclear weapons.
The increased production of ,
weapons with first strike a
capability, however, “doesn’t
-make any sense.”

Cottom said that Hatﬁeld’s
amendment will “sensitize the
senators to the issue. From the
point of view of education it. is
important that this be pushed.,
And I hope that it is voted
upon,” he said. " .

Liane Norman, a writing
teacher at Pitt, attended the
2nd Riverside Disarmament
Conference in New York

-recently, _at which Hatﬁeld
spoke. Although Norman said
that she agrees with the ideas
in Hatﬁeld’s amendment would
doesn’t necessarily agree with
its strategy.

Norman said that many
people who are close to this
issue on the disarmament side-
believe the Soviets are worried ‘
that Hatﬁeld’s_amendment will

11.
“The Soviets have IIiSiC?.'ied

that after SALT II is passed,
they are willing to‘ freeze
production and deployment
and then negotiate reduc-
tions.”

Norman said that she still
thinks Hatﬁeld’s amendment is
important because it "shows
that SALT II 'doesnTt endjthe
arms race. It is a device to
focus public _ awareness on
SALT II.” A

Engels Candidate rot- Pittsbmgh School Board J

By TERESA SOKOL '
’ Pitt News Staff Writer

David Engel, professorof education and candidate for Pittsburgh
School Board against incumbent Solomon Abrams, discussed issues of
desegregation and education in city schools in a recent interview.

Engel, a_ Democrat, ran on both Democrat and Republican tickets
and won a cross-ﬁled Republican ballot in the primary by 200-300
votes. Engel's campaign area includes Shadyside, one half of Squirrel
Hill, _Oakland and Greenﬁeld. '

’ The city school board is currently facing a-Nov. 7 deadline in which to
submit‘a desegregation plan to the Pennsylvania Human Relations
Commission (PHRC)-. I ~

The board delayed action on school reorganization last week. The
plan assigns all students to elementary school for ﬁve years, middle
schools for three years, and high schools for four years. Not all city
schools run_on this format. - I

Engel pointed out that the board has stalled and used evasive legal
action sincel968 on desegregation. ' I

“That's like putting off the inevitable,” he said.

The plan the board submitted to the PHRC in March, which included
the Magnet Advisory Committee’s ﬁndings, was unacceptable, -Engel
said.

“They were given a limited period of tinie to implement a new plan.
It looks now like things have become politicized and hope for-a plan by
Nov. 7'is not good.” ‘

Engel said that there is a good chance that the board may be held in
contempt of court if an acceptable method is hot found. If not, they will
be ordered to develop a desegregation plan in a short time or the court

” will appoint someone’ to do so-—which takes desegregation out of the

hands of the school board, he added.
However, if the PHRC saw enough major change in the board it

. ' might warrant delaying action on Pittsburgh desegregation.

Five spots on the board are open in the Nov. 6 election, ‘Engelsaid.

Candidates in other districts like Frances Vitti and"'.Iames Robinson
along with Engel, are challenging incumbents.

Engel, who has experience studying the successful desegregation of‘

the Minneapolis, Minnesota school district, noted that there is no
operant desegregation plan which does not have some mandatory
transportation. ‘ _ -

“The question is how to minimize busing so that it does not become
the burden of any one group. We have a lot of voluntary one-way
busing of blacks into what have been essentially white schools.’ They
have bus rides of one-half to one hour.” “ . ,-

Any system created, Engel said, must -be carefully planned so
transportation can be minimized.

“Sure it can be done, but it won’t be easy and compromises need to
be made,” he said..

Unequal school facilities on the secondary school level is not a

problem sincethere has been a facility upgrading in the,last several '

years, Engel said. /

Another critical issure beyond desegregation is better research and
evaluation of the school system, he said.

“For example, Vann School in the Hill district has had for several
years a reading level that is above the national norms. We need to see
what they are doing right that could be useful to other schools.”
The research department of the school board was closed in 1970, Engel
noted. '

The most disturbing thing Engelsaid he has noticed in his campaign

. is the potential for violence many people have because they fear the
‘ unknown in desegregation. .
“Unless we get some leaders that take a stand, we are hurting the

whole school system.”

Engle added that a positve course could lead to understanding.

“I’ve learned an interesting, thing. Both white and black parents are
fearful. But this makes a common human factor—we can learn to live
together. "I think it is necessary.” he said.

Proposed
Salt ll
Amendment

(Continued from page 1)
SALT II are valid,” said Joseph
Coffey, Director of the Center
for Arms Control and Inter-
national Security Studies at

, Pitt. “It is not the ‘be all and
end all’ of arms control. But it
does at least make important
restrictions. ’ ’

Coffey said that he thinks
Hatﬁeld’s amendment would
‘ “require a complete renegotia-

tion with the Soviet Union. This ‘J

._-V

-kind of drastic change is highly

unlikely.”
However, he said that
,Hatﬁeld could send along

Senate sentiment with SALT II
that the U.S. should call fonfa
moratorium on the develop-
ment, testing and deployment
of nuclear weapons. '

Jack Robertson, a Hatﬁeld
aid. said that any delay in
callihg for a moratorium
“could be critical” and that it
should be included as a part of
SALT 11.

Carl Beck, director of the
University Center for Inter-

at 4 pm. in Presbyterian-
University .Hospital. Prof.
Beck was 49 years old.

An internationally recog-
nized scholar, Dr. Beck has
been director of UCIS from its
inception in 1968. Throughout
his writings about the future of
the center and the university he
emphasized the strong inter-
national dimensiorr of the
university and his vision of the
UCIS as the logical extension of
that strength.

Dr. Beck was awarded his
undergraduate degree from
Pitt and his doctorate from
Duke University. He served in
the U.S. Army from 1954-56
and received a Commendation
Medal. - '

As professor of political
science at Pitt, Dr. Beck's

‘ areas of interest included

international studies, informa-
tion sciences and comparative
communism. He was awarded
numerous research grants from
private and public sources.

Dr. Beck also served as
director’ of Pitt's Information
Utilization Laboratory since
1972. He was a member of

' numerous national and inter-

national organizations and’
committees including the
National Committee of the
International Research and

Exchange Board; the UNESCO
Feasibility Study Committee
for an International University;
and the International Studies
Association of which he was
executive director. .

Carl Beck’s'death on October

irreplaceable loss to the Uni-

leadership was so important to
all of his colleagues.

‘Carl Beck stood so clearly for

often embattled values of the
modern scholarly life, of
rational inquiry and —intéma-

tributed' forcefully to the

Carl Beck combined adrrhni-
stration with scholarship. He
never thought of himself as
confined by the frames of
reference of one discipline
alone, he tried to serve social ‘A

tic scholarship. Modem social

with a vast division of labor.

Letters q             A ‘
Opposing Response to‘Unimpresive’Homecoming Formal 

1‘.‘b'

I would like to respond to the
letter recently published which
complained about the supposedly
“un.i~mpressive" Homecoming
"Formal. Mr. Ostrosky’s letter was
not only inaccurate, but ignorant
and uncalled for as well.

Asa-graduate student with seven
years of Pitt education behind me, I
.._can unequivocally say that. this
-year's formal was by far the most
..enjoyable experience ‘I have had at

. an affair .of that kind, surpassing

even the Greek formals I have
attended. The Sheraton Inn-On-
'»I‘-he-_Ma1l provided a plush envir-
onment, and though admittedly the
dance ﬂoor could have been bigger,
I expect that the overwhelming
onrush of students eager to dance
could only compliment the band
that was playing. Their music was
great to dance to, and the length of
each ' song (usually about 5-8
minutes) more than offset the fact
that they took-a break after 4 or 5
songs (not after every song, as Mr.
Ostrosky inaccurately reported).
As for the table service,

everyone around our party was

quite impressed with the fancy hors
d’oevres, which were served piping
hot and in great quantity. Mr.
Ostrosky’s suggestion that “every-
thing should have been provided
when we arrived” overlooks the
obvious fact that they would have
been cold for sure. Most students

in the middle of an evening out,‘
anyway, rather than right at the

. beginning.

My ﬁnal comment is directed to
the overall tone of Mr. Ostrosky’s
complaint. If you are unhappy with
the quality of the enterprise,. put
your effort where your mouth is,
and work on the Homecoming
Committeeiiext year. At least your
criticism would be more produc-
tive. '-

Accusations i

Associate Professor Bert Rock-
man says that I pointed a “witless
and wildly inaccurate” barb in his
direction in an otherwise less
barbarous letter in the Pitt News.

This is the claim he objects to:
“Defending a statement by Profes-
sor Cottam to the effect that the
Ayatullah was an Iranian Martin
Luther King, Rockman warned that
only political scientists were quali-
fied to interpret the unfolding
Iranian Revolution.”

According to Rockman, this is a

‘misreading of what both he and’

Cottam said‘ concerning the politi=.
cal situation in Iran shortly after
of_ the revolution

tyrannies. ” _ . ,

there last winter.

Let’s look at the facts.

In" the ’ University Times for
January 25, 1979, right smack in
the middle of Page One, Cottom is
quoted. The Khomeini movement,
he says, “is really nothing more
than social activism and resembles,
in many ways, the civil rights
movement in this country in the
1960’s. Only instead of ministers
and rabbis leading people in a ﬁght
for human dignity, freedom and
justice, in Iran you have the
mullahs—priests—led by the
exiled Khomeini.” '

Hogwash, answered Professor
Maurice Sussman, a biologist. “To“
expect that any government born of
organized and entrenched religious
evangelism...will provide a vehicle
for social justice, human rights and

the brotherhood of man is to

disregard the lessons of history.”

Waxing normative, Cottam
maintained, “We have to get rid of
stereotypes, particularly the one
we have of the backward Moslem. ”
Then, matter-of-factly, “Labeling
the Khomeini movement as funda-
mentalist and reactionary is label-
ing it falsely.”

Tackling this mixed bag of
empirical and normative claims,
Sussman observed that “the
governments of the world ‘m which
Islam is the state religion are by
and large a collection of despotic

Rockman is ludicrously lacking in
insight when he implies that what's
at issue here is Sussman’s inability
to distinguish between “state-
ments meant to describe an
empirical condition and normative
statements which set forth one’s
preference. ’ ’

For normatively_ charged terms,
take your pick between Cottam’s

(human dignity, freedom, justice) '

and Sussman’s (social justice,

human rights, and the brotherhood

of man). Since neither gives us a

rule of thumb for distinguishing a~
movement ﬁghting for justice from

one which is not, it is impossibleto

tell just what either person is

claiming about the empirical

world—but neither can be laughed

out of court.

It is in this context that the
meaning of Rockman’s assertions
that
whereof one speaks,” and that
“qualifications are not directly
transferable from one field of
knowledge to another,” must be
interpreted. In response to
Suss_man’s criticism of Cottam’s
claims,” Rockman shifts the focus
of critical dialogue from testing
claims to evaluating the credentials
of speakers—-a move more appro-
priate in the scholastic than in the
scientiﬁc tradition. ,

And how, Rockman would like to
know, does all this relate to the

argumwt ..i9..the.. 991.I.r.§e_..9f which .1. .

.‘.'.‘I.". {)¢'.~‘i'1‘n’J"..'i_ I .-_‘1.Y.v 7

    

“it is worthwhile to know‘

inexplicably ‘loosed a few ‘pot-shots 

at him? .

My argument was that many in
the Pitt community have a rigid
habit of looking for the root of every
campus problem—-in the form of
someone to blame—-within‘ the
bounds of the campus. We ignore
the political and social roots of our
seemingly local, personal dil-
emmas. '

In- this ‘context, I claimed that/K

when the people who makeit their
business to study links between

events in the social world (for V

example, Mr. Rockman) maintain
that only they .are qualiﬁed to
formulate and criticize political,
hypotheses, they reinforce the
tendency of non-specialists to
ignore‘ connections between the
personal and the political all
together.

Rick Trocano’s
turned out to Dan Marino’s good
‘ fortune and the end ',result was
Pitt’s 24-7 defeat of Navy, a win
which firmly establishes the
Panthers as the top-ranked team in
the East. although the true
0‘ champion won’t be determined
until Dec. 1 at State College, Pa.

Just when it. appeared Trocano
might become the ﬁrst quarterback
in Pitt history to go four years
without an injury, disaster struck
the junior from Ohio. On a third
and ﬁve play in the ﬁrst quarter,
Torocano couldn't ﬁnd an open
receiver, so he tucked the ball
under his arm and rolled to the
right, sliding over the 30-yard line
for ﬁrst down yardage. But in the
process, Trocano pulled a ham-
string, a nagging injury which
‘could persist anywhere from one
week to a month.

In stepped Marino, the local here
from Central Catholic who was put
into a pressure" situation for the
first time in his brief career. After
fumbling the first series he was in,
Marino settled down and led the
Panthers to the first score of the
game, a 39-yard ﬁeld goal by Mark
Schubert.

Navy had its lone moment of
glory in the second quarter after
JoJo Health fumbled a punt, and
the Midshipmen recovered.

On a‘ fourth and one from Pitt’s
27, and the Pitt defense stacked in
a man-to-man formation,

‘ quarterback Bob Powers faked to
the running back inside, dropped
back, and lofted a soft scoring pass
down the sideline to Carl Hender-
shot, who had to bully his way into
the endzone with Heath riding his
back;

misfortune,

Navy’

The score stood at 7-3 Navy at
halftime, but it was only a matter of
time before Marino put _ some
points on the board.

The Panthers took the lead late
in the third quarter on a fourth and
goal play from the three. Marino
rolled right, and tossed a scoring
strike to Fred Jacobs in the corner
of the endzone. It was a big play
for the Panthers, Marino and
particularly Jacobs, who got back
into the lineup after sitting on the
bench during Pitt’s win over
Washington last week.

With a 10-7 lead, the win was
wrapped up, becuase there was no
way Navy could do anything
against the Pitt defense, which is
now molding into one of the best
units in the nation. Pitt held Navy
to six first downs, 50 yards rushing,
and 116 total yards. Hugh Green
was all over the field, and the
interior line, led by Jerry Boyarsky,
Bill Neill and Greg Meisner,
completely thwarted Navy’s run’-
ning game.

But the day belonged to Marino,
who came to Pitt with more rave
reviews and banner headlines than
any other football player, including
Tony Dorsett. And impressively,
Marino accepted the challenge,
demonstrating great poise and
leadership uncharacteristic for a
freshman, and especially a quarter
back.

“We came together in the
second half when our backs were to
theiwall,” Marino told a group of
writers after the game. “You gotta
have confidence in yourself, and I
think I did a pretty good ‘job,
overall.”

Pitt Coach Jackie Sherrill was
also pleased with the way the team
responded to the situation in the

Pitt tried its one-two punch
against Kent State on the Schenley
, Park 10,000 meter cross—country
course Saturday, but the Panthers
were KO’d by a balanced Golden

Flash attack, 25-36.

The one-two scoring of Pitt’s
‘Gary Siriano (31:38) and Randy
‘Bailey (32:14) was offset by KSU’s
capture of places three through
nine. Leading the way for Kent
State was Paul Hoffman (32:17)
and Tim Griffith (32:20).

“We really didn’t know too much
about Kent State ahead of time,”
said Pitt assistant coach Mel
Boyd.” We thought the meet
would turn out to be close,

1 although tighter than it really did
turn out.” _

The Panthers were running
without Bob Landstrom, who is
recovering from a leg injury
incurred in last week’s Miller Lite
race. With KSU’s overall strength,
however, it is doubtful Pitt could
have pulled out the win, even with
Landstrom’s help. '

“We were kind of hoping for
someone to split up their pack
runners and maybe take a ﬁfth,”
said Boyd, “but it wouldn’t have
made a difference in the meet’s
outcome.” V

Completing the team scoring form,

Pitt was John Huchison, tenth
(35:05), Rich Laitta, eleventh
(35:35), Jim Herrmann, twelfth

(36:02), Mark Hazlett, thirteenth
(36:15) and Rip Wagner, four-
teenth (39:04).

“We just did some easy distance
in preparation for this meet,” said
Kent State coach Bill Dunlap, a

' native of Irwin. Pennsylvania.

In review of the hilly Schenley
Park course, Dunlap added, ‘ ‘I hate
it, it's a tough course.”

Despite a lack of hill workouts in
flat Ohio, the KSU team did not
appear bothered by the steep
terrain as much as would be
expected. . ‘

The meet was the last. home 10
kilometer run for seniors Siriano
and Herrmann. Pitt will compete
on" the Schenley Park trials this
weekend in the John F. Kennedy
memorial races against a multitude
of collegiate and club runners, plus
a large number of joggers. This
will be a five kilomenter (3.1 miles)
run.

The following weekend will bring
the Panthers’ most important race
of the year, the NCAA qualifyer at
Lehigh. Siriano and possibley
Bailey, who is running with a
pulled thigh muscle, will make the
trip.

“My leg was a little tight at first
today," said Bailey, “but I hope I
can make it to the qualifyer.”

Those Eastern schools running
the meet will have an advantage
over colleges from different parts

‘of the country in that the Lehigh.

course is also the site of this year’s
NCAA ‘championship race.

‘Han-is Touchdo wns’ spark Steelers

By The Associated Press

, I

Pittsburgh’s defense throttled
the Dallas running game and
ﬂattened quarterback Roger Stau-
bach while Franco Harris ran for
touchdowns of 1 and 48 yards
Sunday, giving the Steelers a 14-3
National football League victory
over the Cowboys.

The Steelers, in a rematch with
their victims of Super Bowls  and
XIII, limited the Cowboys’ ground
game to 79 yards, 73 of _them by
Tony Dorsett, whose club record
streak of consecutive 100-yard
games was halted at four.

And with 13‘/2 minutes to play,
Staubach, under pressure on
almost every passing down, eluded
tackles by Gary Dunn and Joh
Banaszak, only to be decked by left

end L.C. Greenwood. Staubach
suffered a concussion and after

several anxious moments was led,

off the ﬁeld.

With ﬁve minutes to go, Dallas
running back Preston Pearson also
was injured and was removed from
the ﬁeld on a stretcher. He
suffered bruised ribs and a
sprained knee.

Harris, who gained 102 yards on
18 carries for the day, scored the
only touchdown Pittsburgh needed
with his fourth-down, 1-yard dive
47 seconds into the second period.
It capped a nine-play, 63-yard
march highlighted by Terry Brad-
shaw's passes of 17 and 11 yards to
John Stallworth. Bradshaw ﬁn-
ished the day by completing lliof
25 passes for 126 yards. '

Staubach, who wound up com-
‘pleting 11 of 25 passes for 113
‘yards, brought the Cowboys back
into position for ‘Rafael Septien’s
32-yard field goal with 5:12 gone in
the second quarter. But on the first
play from scrimmage following a
Dallas punt midway in the third

period, Harris burst through a hole,

off left guard, shook off Cowboys’
right tackle Randy White, then
deked past safety Cliff Harris and
raced unchallenged into the end
zone. _
After Harris’ 1-yard plunge
behind a block by tight end Randy
Grossman, Staubach completed
passes of 17 and 13 yards. to Drew

For the second straight week, the

I Pitt women’s volleyball team lost a

tournament due‘ to a lack of
emotion. The Pantherettes (25-16-
3) ﬁnished fourth at the 20-team
Maryland Invitational behind Rut-
gers, Maryland and Georgetown.

“We got our butts kicked against
Maryland," said head coach Mike
Hebert. “Even if we had been
playing well, I don’t_ know if we’d
have won.”

The Pantherettes also had an
easy time in handling South

By The Associated Press
PITTSBURGH - Terry Bradshaw
stood on the sidelines Sunday and
marvelled at what his Pittsburgh
teammates were doing to Roger
Staubach and the rest of the Dallas
Cowboys.

“This is the best the defense has
played all year,” the Pittsburgh
quarterback said after_ the Steelers
wrecked Dallas’ running ‘game,

ﬂattened Staubach and rode Franco L

Harris’ touchdown“ runs of 1 and 48

yards to, a 14-3 National Football '

League victory over the Cowboys. ~
“If we play against everybody the

' way we played against Dallas, we’ll

be back in the Super Bowl,”
Bradshaw said after the Steelers
had registered their fourth straight
victory over the Cowboysgincluding
the triumphs in Super Bowls X and
XIII.

Tony Dorsett, who had run ‘t for
more than 100‘ yards in each of
Dallas’ -previous four games,
carried 19 times for 73 yards, all
but six of the yards the cowboys

punched out on the ground against .

the Steelers.

“Execution, that’s the key,” said
Dorsett, who went to school in the
Pittsburgh area. “If you can’t

execute, you’re not going to run on’

Hopewell High, much less the Steel
Curtain.

“On ﬁrst downs, we got either
one yard or no yards. You have to
get something on first down,” he
added. And Staubach confirmed:
“We had no success running on
ﬁrst down. We ended up with a lot
of second-and-10s, so we had to
begin passing on ﬁrst downs,
passing more than we would have
wanted to.”

“They shut us down,” said Dallas
Coach Tom Landry. “We probably
played as poorly offensively as we
have all year. We had two or three
chances to get in for a touchdown
and didn’t do it. Ifwe get in even
once, the game’s entirely differ-

“Their rush, the blitz, gave us,

some problems,” said Staubach.

I

According to thecoach, Mary-
land totally outplayed Pitt in every
aspect of the game, but added that
given another chance, the Panther-
ette_s could defeat Maryland.

In the consolation match, Pitt
fell to Georgetown in a close match
by scores of 15-13, 15-13.

“The Georgetown match was
meaningless to us, but meant
everything to them because they’ve
never beat .us before,” said
Hebert. ' .

The coach added that the team
wasn’t at all ready for the
tournament.

“I could never‘ have predicted
that we’d play so bad,” said
Hebert. “I was excited before it,
but everything just fell through.

“Most of the season, we’ve been
a consistent group,” he added.
“The team has to again prove that
they can play consistently. It's
really all up to them.”

A win at Maryland could have
wrapped upia number-one seeding
in the regionals‘ for Pitt, but now

. .":.':'

the Pantherettes will have to
scramble to keep one of the top
positions in the east.

“This loss really hurt us,” said
Hebert. “What’s happened is that
we peaked real early because of our
toughtschedule early in the year.

We were strong all-season until two .

weeks ago.’ '

/.

Earlier in the season, Pitt
competed in several
hotbeds like Hawaii, California and
Texas. Since the ,Houston
Invitational over two weeks ago,
the Pantherettes haven't really
been pushed physically, only
emotionally.

But Dorsett lost three yards on
ﬁrst down and gained only one
after failing to find a receiver on a
planned option pass. On third
down, Staubach hit Butch Johnson
in the middle of the end zone, «but
the ball bounced straight up, and
before it could get back down to
Johnson, linebacker Dennis Wins-
ton knocked him out from under it,
forcing the Cowboys to settle for
Septien’s field goal.

The three points scored by the
Cowboys were their fewest. since a
23-3 loss to the New York Giants in
the ﬁnal game of the 197 season.

Septien missed another 32-yard
ﬁeld goal attempt late in the third
period, kicking the ball wide to the
leftafter Staubach had completed
passes of 17 yards to Drew Pearson
and 22 yards to DuPree in a drive
from the Dallas 32 to the Pittsburgh
11. Dorsett ran for 21 yards in that
march, the longest single run

against the Steelers this season.

missed; wide to the left.

an 0-3 nonleague start and
unwanted by the Alabama-loving

The hardfact is that Georgia will

In a nonleague game, the No, 1

“They had to go out and show
the character that they had,-” said
Sherrill. “If they had a good
football team, they had to go out
and show it, and they did.”

The win was more impressive
because the Panthers also had
difficulty moving the ball on the
ground. Randy McMillan, playing
injured, gained 38 yards on 18
carries, while Rooster Jones had 36
yards on 13 carries, one touch-
down, and Jacobs garnered 25
yards on nine carries."

make many_mistakes.”
