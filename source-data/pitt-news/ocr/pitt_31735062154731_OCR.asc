VROTC and an almost unanimous_de-

mand for a larger organization were

«expressed by individual members-or‘.

improvement and increased size, a
feeling exists that new uniforrns of

parel similar to hatwith which the

Dennis C.*Kurjack, Ed. '33, one

at the Ohio State game can readily
be accounted‘ for,‘ since the Buck-

Tomorrow,‘ Peigmistate will have
itsgolden opportunity to upset the

unbeaten Pitteleivenk and thus shat.-
terthe Panther hopes for the, east-.
ern and national, football titles. ‘-
Pitt-,is, favored. to. trip the « N it-
‘tany eleven ‘and-‘to cop ‘the grid
championship of the East. Also,
Coach. Sutherland will undoubtedly
be anxious to overwhelm rth_e-~Nit-
tany Lion -under a. cluster of points
in order to reaffirm the Panthe_r_’e_
right for arole in the Tournamen
of the Roses. A 
However, the Lion will prove?any-
thing but a snap, inasr'nu‘ch;as. itis
showing more ability than’. at any
time since the Mike Palm-.Glen‘:;Kil-
linger-Harry Wilson and, Bob Hig-
gins combination made State foot-
ball. teamsthe best ins the.’ East.
Coach ’Hugo Bezdek can’ be'depend-
ed .upon to have’ his '- squad" in tip-.
tsp shape] and: primed for the bat-
te.l’ . 3.-- 
Penn State will probably ‘line up
with Lasich, fullba_ck‘;” Evans, half.-
back; Diedrich, halfback; . French,
quarterback; Edwards,-— right‘ end;
Kaplan,.left end; .Shawley, . "left
tackle; ' Pacaccion, right . tackle:
Zorella, left guard; Ricker, right
guard,__.and McAndrews, center.. 
,Frencli.7;an‘d'~ .D,iedrich- are 2» out-
standing}: backs. Their‘ ' miraculous
play after the whistle had blown,
ending-the Lafayette game, gave
Penn State a 6-3‘ victory. They are
both consistent ball carriers, and
have played together during three
years at State and the same length
of time at Staunton Military Acad-
emy. pLasich, a. sophomore, '_-has
been especially successful at buck-
ing the line.’ Evans is largely used
as an interference ’man. '

Zorella hasbeen playing a bang-
up game atguard all season, while
acting Captain “Dutch” Rickey has

other guard position. Edwardsand
Kaplan ‘are -both excellent ends,
Kaplan particularly - having“ dis-
played great form this year. .

Penn State has defeated six op-
; onents, among  them -Lafayette,
yracuse“ and. " Pennsylvania’, ‘ and_
 been‘-._ beaten-by  Y.-.5} U.1
Bucknell.  '   i

It has been ten years since Penn
State has. been able to‘ win as ‘con-
test here. In 1919, Pop ‘Warner-’s
Panthers were licked 20-0. In 1920
and 1921, the two teams fought to
scoreless. ties.‘ Since then, Pitt has
succeeded in winning seven -straight
victories. . ' '

Since 1893- Pitt and Penn State
have met ;31 times. The Pantheijs
have annexed 17 games, the Lions
have. won 12,, and two of the, en-
counters ended in ties. In these
games Pitt has amassed 377 ‘points
to State’s 297.

A-record crowd is expected to‘ ﬁll
the Pitt Stadium for ‘the last time
to see one of the greatest aggrega-
tions of moderné_footbal,l_;\in action.

Fresh ‘Rules  C  

At noon today freshman regulations, for men which have made a
weak struggle for existence during "the past two months are to be for-
mallycast into the junkheap. . i ‘. ' ' ' ' "

Now that everybody, including -the freshmen, know that the regula-_

, tions‘ have been a‘ ﬂop it is safe for'th_,eiPitt” Weekly to put. this eulogy

before the students. in a printed statement.

This experimental‘ set‘ of rules was ‘successful in one "way: it proved
to everyone_that“this was not the proper set to be tried on first-year men

V V at Pitt. With tlie exception of last year Student Councilhas been trying
.« out diﬁerent types ofvfreshman customs .every fall andvspring for many-
‘ ' And thus 'far»the committees incharge haven’t been able tode-.
V_.~j‘s.i,'g;1'1-3 any group which have been even gmildly successful. This year the
,’  successful attempt thus far was made--the caps, black ties and

socks were worn by all frosh for at week. But lack of interest “in the
rules. and fresh. by uppercla’ssmen' soonbroke down the morale of/the
enforcement groups and another failure was recorded by the council.

The permanent committee on student loyalty and enthusiasm recently
created by 'Student.,. Council is. facing a diﬁicultﬁkjob. After inventing
some ‘potent remedy overcome empty assembly -halls and mute cheer-

ing sections at athle ic events this committee will. have nothing. to do.

but ﬁgure out a workable set .of
forcing these customs. E .~

frosh rules and eﬂicient methodvof en-3
The fault isn't with the freshmen. They like the idea of traditional

customs and are in favor of seeing a demonstration of college spirit even
if it_ may prove painful at times. In conferences with senior-1 advisers; 
recently, freshmen deplored the failure of the rules this year and were
unanimously’ in favor of securing a system which would be workable and?
beneﬁcial. Pitt administrative oﬂicials, interviewed by,Weekly writers,

also recognized the value of“frosh**rules and expressed hopethat student

leaders would soon be able to-do somethinglabout the distressing situa-V.

tioniin regard to “pep” on the campus. V . _ >

Student Council, enjoying a long vacation during the Thanksgiving
season, should be alarmed about this situation. The opening of another
semester will arrive in a short time‘ and a new opportunity to erase the
failures of the past will be presented. Perhaps whén»mcm_b‘ers-of, the
co_ur_ic_i_I _convene (two weeks. . from »toni_ght they_ will _hav‘e; some. cbfnstructive

:“id¢as"~to’b'¢ suggested‘ to "the; frosh;_ rules .lcoI‘rhh_it_t.ee and’ the enthusiasm

and loyalty group. Or perhaps they will‘ merely discuss the problem,
shelve it for later reference and hope the future will care for itself.

.Today at 3‘o’clock in the Heinz House. the first of‘ a series» of open

discussions on controversial’ subjects will be conductedwith Tucker. Smith,

celebrated anti-mili/tarist, as leader. The seriesof meetings, whichwillf
feature nationally- known speakers and authorities on varied .subjects,17is' .

under, the direction~of the assémbly‘c'ommittee« of Student ‘Council, with
James Lindsay, Bus. Ad. ’30,'chairman. ’ ’ . ’ S . . '

Since. the disappearance of the ill-fated Liberal: Club last spring‘ a
group. on the campus has been de.mand'ing_an opportunityﬁto declare in
public their feelings on controversial subjects. “Today this group has
the chance to demonstrate to the University" and to student leaders that
it merely wantedthis opportunity for. disousion; that it hasn’t‘ been agi;
Vtating, t‘he-student body at various times for the purpose of causing

The subjectvfor Smith’s_o discussion, “ll/lilitarism in Education,” is one

-which should be of exceptional interest to Pitt-men and women.- Theen-_

‘If 818186 crowd attends the meeting and enters‘_with- enthusiasm

into the discussion the committee in charge will recognize, the need on
the campus for similar gatherings. But if a. small, uninterested group
is presentit will be evident the eﬁorts to secure? a new Liberal Club
