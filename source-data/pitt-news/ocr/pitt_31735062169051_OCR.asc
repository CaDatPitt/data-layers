Coffee Hour Hosts Pittsburgh UI1C0I1V€I1ti0I1a1 C0111’S€
Performing Artists Director

“Theatre is a business, and its commodity is entertainment,”

commented Jack

Brown at a recent poorly-attended SU Coffee Hour. Brown, managing Director of the
newly-formed Pittsburgh Performing Artists Foundation (PPAF), spoke on innovations
in staging productions and their use in the PPAF.

He continued, “Maximum
management efficiency is
just as important as good
theatre performance. The

’ _ way to attain this efficiency
in the theatre is to be gov-’

erned, directed and managed by
professional theatre personnel.”
Brown explained that the Board
of Trustees of the P-PAF would
be comprised of these profes-
sional people and that an Ad-
visory Council would also be
established with repyesentatives
of the community and other the-
atre peronalities.

Our long-range goal,” empha-
sized Brown, “will be in de-
veloping new authors and pre-
senting superior original works.
We also want to revitalize im-
portant American and European
plays that we can identify with
and that will stimulate the mind
and activate the emotions. We
plan to provide Pittsburgh aud-
iences with theatrical excite-
ment and diversification in en-
tertainment.” _

Brown plans a “nine-month
season of ten plays. Comple-
menting the main season will be
a ‘month of Mondays’ in which
we will use basically local tal-

-ent. In this month, we will ex-
periment in dance, plays, and

other phases of the performing
arts. It will be an opportunity
for work continuity for people
interested in the arts.”

“We will have eight resident
actors and a resident play-
wright, supplemented by local
actors. We will try to have guest
directors for a play or a series
of plays. Each director would
handle the type of play in which
he specializes.” .

Brown's theatre will employ
the “total-theatre a p p r o a c h,
which will eliminate the boun-
daries between the actor and the
audience through involvement
and intimacy.” Brown present-
ed picture slides taken from a
scale model of the theatre, which
when completed will be located
on Mt. Washington at the old
‘Shiloh movie theatre.

The slides pictured a revolv-
ing turntable twenty feet in di-
ameter on the stage. The or-
chestra is underneath the stage
for a “harmonious blending of
yocal and musical sound.” The

‘ house contains‘ fiberglass struc-

tures on which scenery may be
projected for a “economy of
physical production c o s t s.”
Brown noted that the “audience
looks straight or down at the
actor instead of up. The main
emphasis is on the play and the
performance, and scenery be-
comes secondary to both. We
setting a

of the play."

Brown commented that to his
knowledge, no other theatre has
these elements at hand. "Their
use is not to be -gimmicy,” he
emphasized, “butonly to add to

 the play.’-’ X 1 ‘ ’

A scale model scene from

Playhouse, the PPAF is self-sus-
taining at fifty percent capacity.
“The Playhouse has a larger
overhead, so they are in trouble
no matter What they do. They
haven’t defined their policy ——
that's why they’re in trouble.”
The Playhouse, however, is
“very,f"enthusiastic” about the
PPAF. '

Brown explained that the “the-
atre "is universal and the “Bye
Bye Birdies” have their place.”
He stressed, however, that the
PPAF ‘-‘won’t do something for
everyone like the Playhouse. We
can't, become a servant to the
audience. We must be our own
master. There is a new a.tmos-
phere in the theatre that is
bubbling up on the surface, and
we want to develop this.” '

The PPAF is no-w on “a one-
time fund-raising.” Brown de-
scribed contributors as general,
contributing any amount; char-

the “open-stage” theatre.

ter, contributing $250 for a re-
served seat; and founding, con-
tributing $5000 for a box seat.
Brown anticipated that “through
the funds, we will’ reach our fi-
nancial goal, receive total ‘com-
munity support, and gain and
audience of individuals, indus-
tries‘ and philanthropic institu- _
tions.’’ ,
Brown related that the pur-
pose of the PPAF is to “comple-
ment and expand theatre and
related performing arts with
local and outside talent. We
plan to present the full spec-
trum of drama with emphasis
on theatrical excellence. We
hope to contribute to theatre de-
velopment through the nation,
b e s id e s helping Pittsburgh,
which is a city of great poten-
tial.” Brown said that he ex-
pected enthusiasm for the PPAF
among the college and student
crowd of young professionals. .

‘Pitt ’Ne<ws’ Recviecw

“Benny at the Opera”

by ROBERT Honowrrz
Last night the Civic Light Opera opened its 22nd sea-
son with a different kind of show. In order to draw larger
crowds, and in order to present more interesting and enjoy-
able programs the CLO Association has added reviews m.c.’d
by renowned performers, i.e.-, Jack Benny and Wayne New-

ton.

Last night’s review was m.c.’d
by Jack Benny, with guest stars
Jack Jones and The Rudanko
Brothers. If last night’s show
was an example of the type of
entertainment that will perform-
cd this season at the Civic
Arena, this will be a very suc-
cessful season.

Besides having good perform-
ers, numerous improvements
have been made on the Civic
Light Opera presentations. First,
the show started on time. Sec-
ond, those who arrived late were
given seats along the sides un-
til the intermission, rather than
disturbing other andience mem-

bers and the performers with

the noisy shuffling while look-
ing for seats in the dark. And
third, the CLO orchestra was
better, than it ever wasbefore;
they -all ‘seemed to beiplayin-gr

the same tune at the same time

an unusual event at the CLO.

Jack Benny meandered to the
center of the stage, and before
he could get a word ‘out the
audience showed their approval
and gave him a long, enthusias-
tic applaus. Benny's’ reaction to
t-he applause was “I promise not
to be “that good” — pause. He
was “that” good, in fact better.
The inimitable Benny style came
across and won the admiration

-of his audience as he has done

for the past 35 years. During
and after the show I couldn't
( I didn’t try), help help over-
hearing comments about his per-
formance. Everyone loved -him,
especially when he played the
violin with 12-year-old (they
have the same teacher) Doris

-Dodge. Benny can play the vio-

lin beautifully when*he tries.

      

Stirs Student Interest . 

In

said Lesley Zark.

These students were talking about the Latin American
Studies (LAS) program. The LAS Program consists of -
fourteen s'tudents and three faculty members who are spe'- --

Latin America

“I don’t think there is a book on Latin America in the 3;
library that hasn’t been checked out,” said Elli Cohen.‘ 

“I want to do the studying,’ said Richard Gebelein.

“At times, even the professors get into arguments,”

cialists in Latin American affairs. . .

They meet on Tuesday and
Thursday mornings‘ for sem-
inars. “At first they were sup-
posed to last two hours. But
sometimes the discussions be-
come so interesting that they
last up to five hours,” said
political s c ie -n c e instructor

_ James M. Malloy.

In addition, students meet in
even smaller groups with indi-
vidual instructors for tutorials,
and to pursue independent
study-.

Most of the students who were
accepted for this program had
some background in Latin Am-
erica affairs. For example, Rich-
ard Gebelein, a math major and
August graduate, spent two
years in Mexico. And Richard

Fogler Library of Shakespeare
grant in study for 1967. He is
the first Fogler fellow from the

sity of Sussex in England and

Named Folger Fellow

two years at Princeton Univer-
sity.

Though Seigle is the Fogler

Fellow, part of the award is ad-
vanced by the White House. This
makes him one of 125 recipients
of White House money for grad-
uate study this year. His award
was granted on the basis of two
papers inspected -by a panel of
three professors in English His-
tory. _ .
Seigle studied under Amundson
Prof. of Anglo-Irish History
Hugh F. Kearny when he was
at the University during the
past year. He will continue
studying under him at the Uni-
versity of Sussex. Seigle says
that Kearny is “one of the great-
est English historians alive.”

Seigle has been a political in-
tern in the office of Sen. Rob-
ert Kennedy and was on the stu-

dent advisory board of the'
_ American Historical Association‘.

 

Wood, a junior sociology major,

spent a. certain amount of time 
in Quito, Ecuador, as did senior "

history major Elli Cohen.
Although only two members
of the faculty are Latin Ameri-

cans,’ all have done extensive re- _-
search in the area. A student re-

     
 

ported one of the more fascin-" ‘ '

ating examples. He related that
Assistant Professor of Sociology
Jose Moreno drove an ambu-
lance for the rebel forces in the .

recent revolution in the -Domin-g '_ -"“"

ican Republic. He had been in
the Dominican Republic work-
ing on his doctorate.

With fourteen students and ‘ 

four instructors, the student-
teacher ratio is unusually high.
“I -think this is advantageous

both to the student and the pro-. , 

fessor,” said Malloy. . .

“I agree,” added Richard
belein, “because this way we get
to know a teacher and under-
stand why he says what he says.

“In other courses,” continued
Lesley Zark, a junior spanish
major, “the professor is always

right. But here the professors ~

argue among themselves.”
“Opinions differ a great deal,
but everyone’s opinions are re-
spected and everyone is equal,”
said Miss Zark. ,
Most of the students prefer

\ this Program to the’ regular tri-
mester of lecture classes. “Ao- V

tually, there is more work in-
volved, but it is much more in-
teresting. There are pressures,
but they come from within,"
said Wood. _

Th e participating students
will receive fifteen- credits for.
their work, distributed in the
subject areas in which they did
individual research. ’

Besides the seminars and tu-r I

torials, students were required
to -attend programs on certain
evenings. The content of the pro-
grams varied from lectures

Ge-V

within the University, to slides  

and movies, to WHO Newsman
Allen Boal.

“I was surprised at the fam-
ous and excellent speakers that
are in the University that I
never heard about,” commented
Elli Cohen. “For example, we

have the Chairman of the Amer-' _
Anthropological Associa- .~

ican
tion, Dr. John P. Gillin, who is
a very good speaker.” i_

F o r th e students, the LAS

 

 

Program was apparently a suc-= * 

cess. “But you must remember,”.

warns Miss Cohen,” that the mo- ' ‘'

tivation level here was much

higher than in other courses.”
Instructor Malloy agrees. “But A,

the main point is that everyone,-'

should learn from this hows.

many pressures upon it, can"

maintain the quality of its un-,=
dergraduate education-" -. ‘

   
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
 

 

   

The recent differences of opinion centering around the actions of

' the Student Government (SG) Allocations Committee has necessitated

an evaluation of a key accusation.

Claims have been hurled, charging various conflicts of interest.
On on aspect of this charge, we disagree with the present policy per-
mitting Allocations Committee members to hold major positions in key
organizations and also serve on the Committee. This policy has just
been initiated thisyear, and already there are questions arising regard-
ing certain members assuming dual roles. The Committee can counter
our stand, affirming that an officer of the Debate Union, for example,
would not participate in the discussion of that particular group’s allo-
cation. But the fact remains that there was a limited amount of money
to be allocated this year and the organizations who by coincidence did
have an officer sitting on the Committee -were on the whole granted

as we turn to our SG Senate and f'ind that certain allocations which were
initially refused were sent back for reconsideration. Some charge that
this occurred because these particular groups were represented on the
Senate floor in the form of senators who were also leaders of organiza-
tions. '

All of these occurrences cannot be purely coincidental. Clearly, the
students can be accused of using their dual capacities to serve their
respective organizations. They are vulnerable if this situation is allowed
to continue. V -

We suggest that members of the Allocations Committee be pro-

hibited from holding an office in a major organization,‘ and that a satis-

factory solution be found to resolve the conflict of interest question
regarding the Senators. Perhaps they should not be permitted to partici-
pate in the session reviewing allocations if the organization which they

their requests. We must point this state of affairs leave the Allocations
Committee in an unnecessarily vulnerable position. There is enough dupli-
cation as it now stands in student leadership roles to let the current
situation stand. We urge the Allocations Committee to recommend that
their successors be allowed to hold no key offices in any major organiza-

tion.

The conflict of interest question can be carried one step further,

Slum Housing

RECENTLY wncxrv, t h e
NBC outlet in Pittsburgh, asked,
as a part of its viewer's poll, the
question, "Are landlords really
responsible for the housing con-
ditions in the slums?” I have no
idea of the result of this poll but
I do -have ‘an answer of my own.
“me blame for the tenements
of the Hill, the rotting shacks of
Manchester, the festering blight
of Glen Hazel lies not just with

..the real estate operators but
must be shared by’ the city of

Pittsburgh.

There are three reasons that I
feel the city must accept respon-
sibility for the substandard
houses’ in Pittsburgh, First, Ur-
ban Renewal in the city has
typically taken the form of re-
moval of the poor. Houses oc-
cupied by -the poor, are torn
down and replaced not by new

, housing developments but by

high rise apartments or, as
Pittsburghers know well, by a
multi-million dollar sports arena
that doesn't even operate at a
profit.

Since World ‘War II this action
has been repeated time and ag-
ain. In the past 20 .years over
five thousand low income hous-
ing units have been destroyed
under t-he guidance of the Urban

__Rcdevelopment Authority, but

 

‘\

only 1200 new units havebeen
built. to take their place. These
units are, almost without excep-
tion, designed for middle and
upper income families.

And what of the poor fam-

Who Is Responsible

ilies? Where do they go when
their houses are gone? Typical-
ly, they move to one of the ex-
isting lower income neighbor-
hoods, already crowded to capa-
city. And this is when t-he slum
landlord enters the situation,
buying up ancient and rundown
homes and subdividing them for
the new arrivals. Had the city
supplied safe, sanitary, and reas-
onably priced housing, there
would be no need for the dis-
placed poor to fall prey to the
landlords.

THE SECOND reason for the
city being to blame for the
slum housing situation also re-
Yates to urban renewal, but at
the same time is a result of the
power structure of Pittsburgh.
That is, Pittsburgh is a city con-
trolled by Big Business. There-
fore its future as a strong in-
dustrial and headquarters center
depends on the favor of busi-
ness. And since in Pittsburgh
big business is controlled by the
Mellon interests, this means the
r:ity’s‘future revolves about the
whims of one powerful family.

The result of this massive iron
glove held over the city is that
any proposal ‘by the city for ur-
ban renewal has been designed
not to give the mass of people
better homes, recreation facili-
ties, or schools, butto boost the
Showplace image Pittsburgh is
so fond of displaying or to pro-
vide new areas, cleared and de-
developed with Federal funds,
for the expansion of private in-

dustry. In recent years the tax
base of the city has increased
three times due to the attrac-
tive terms offered to business by
Pittsburgh's so-called Renaiss-
ance. Yet there have been no
new housing projects other than
:1 senior citizens home, few new
schools, and new playgrounds
and recreation only in the mid-
dle-class neighborhoods such as
Squirrel Hill. _

The final reason for the city's
guilt in the slum housing situ-
ation is an outgrowth of the
failure to provide decent new
houses for displaced families
and of its control by industrial
and business interests. Since re-
development has caused people
to move into already packed
areas, the city, not having lived
up to its responsibility to find
them homes, has been forced to
turn its back on the problem.
Housing codes are not enforced;
if they were slum landlords
could not operate but the same
time the tenants would be with-
out " shelter,

ALSO, CITY agencies such as
the Housing Authority and the
Health Department have not ful-
filled their ‘purpose. The Hous-
ing Authority has not lobbied
for new construction, but per-'
haps this is to be expected since
its director is a political appoint-
ee and cannot afford to rock the
boat. The Health Department,
on the other hand, has been
very reluctant to condemn hous-
es in slum areas or even to pros-
ecute - landlords for health viol-
ations. .

Again, if the departments
were to carry out their respon-
sibilities the slumlord would be
out of business. But, then the
city would be forced to provide
decent and safe housing for its
poor, which it does not seem wil-
ling to do. However, Pittsburgh
can no longer stand idly by
while profiteers are permitted to
make a mockery of the Renais-
sance. The slumlord is at fault
-but the city -has created him.
Only/ when Pittsburgh's rebirth
applies equally to all Pittsburgh-

ers will the slum housing con-

ditions be gone forever.

 

decisions can lose their effectiveness, far too easily.

Letters to

Senate Defended
by Doperak

Editor, The Pitt News:

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII ,

In a column appearing in The '

Pitt News, Friday, June 30, writ-

ten by a member of the Alloca- -

tions Committee, a plea was
made to prohibit a member of
the Student Government Senate
from voting on allocations in
which he has vested -interest, be-
cause it gives him “an unfair
voice in the final decision.” Per-
haps there is a valid issue here
which should be investigated,
but there was also an unneces-
sary blast at the dignity of the
entire Senate—-not. just a few
members.

The three returned allocations
which were particularly resent-
ed by t-he Allocations Commit-
tee were those of the Engineer-
ing ..Ca'binet, Druids, and the
Pitt‘Capsule. Although each of
these organizations was repre-
sented in the Senate, each .was
returned for a sound reason——-
because of misunderstandings
of the Allocations Committee
which were brought out during
Senate debate. The Committee
had thought that there was a
conflict with another organiza-
tion in the program outlined by
Druids, which was proven did
not exist. They denied the En-
gineering Student -Cabinet their
request because they misunder-
stood their relationship with En-
gineering Cabinet Central Plan-
ning. And a misunderstanding
of circulation of the Pitt Cap-
sule was the reason for the fin-
ancial cut. Each instance shows
the necessity of bringing the
recommendations before the
Senate to be scrutinized.

the Editor

The senators did not spend
nine ho-urs of their Saturday,
most coming from out of town,
just to return a few selfish re-
quests. Each allocation was giv-
en extensive attention. The A110-
cations Committee should not re-
sent the -return of allocations.
There would be no need for Sen-
ate -action if all allocations were
to be accepted, Do you really
think that one senator, arguing
for his specific allocation, can
sway the entire Senate (while
four Allocation Committee mem-
bers argue against), if good
cause were not present for the
return of an allocation?

I believe that the Senate was
thorough and sincere. Out of the
six allocations «returned, three
were recommended for increases
and three for cuts. I equally.be-
lieve that the Allocations Com-
mittee was thorough and sin-
cere. The four members were
undivided on every stand and
were immovable. The time and
effort which they put into the
allocations request was enor-
mous, and they should be con-
gratulated for their efforts.

I do wish, however, that they
would realize that the senators
are not their enemies. Our goals
are the same and our interest
equal. It is disturbing to hear
the Committee repeat that the
return of -an allocation by the
Senate “may or may not cause

Illlllllllllllllllli H

the Committee to make differ--

ent recommendations.” The in-
tegrity of the Senate ‘ should
also ‘be realized. The passage of
requests through the Senate is
more thanformality. Their rec-
ommendations should be respec-
ted.
