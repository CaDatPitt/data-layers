UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH,

F i res in
Tower B
force
evacuation
of students

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

At around 4 a.m. Friday, Oct.
9, an unknown culprit or culprits
ignited two fires on the ninth
floor in Litchfield Tower B.

One fire was set in a trash can,
the. other in the trash chute, ac-
cording to Walter Waters, assis-
tant director of the department of
public safety at Pitt. Residents of

F the tower were shut out from'
their rooms for almost twohou.rs.. _. .

‘ 

I woke up,
[somebody] said, ’Let’s
get the hell out of
here’. '

— Domince Romeo

Alerted by the fire alarms, resi-
dents found smoke in their
rooms, in the halls and in the
stairwells. The entire building
was immediately evacuated, with
most of the 769 residents stand-
ing out in the Towers lobby.

in the rush to leave, many resi-
dents had not even put on shoes
or socks, while others were in
shorts and robes.-

After firemen on the scene dis-
covered that it would take some
time to clear the smoke, the resi-
dents were moved to David
Lawrence Hall.

Eventually, students moved
into the two big lecture. rooms,
120 and 121, to either sleep or
talk with friends.

’’I woke up, and [somebody]
said, ’Let’s get the hell out of
here,’ so I grabbed a sheet and
two pillows because I figured I
wouldn't be back for a while,”
said freshman Domince Romeo.
”There was smoke everywhere.”

Campus police said it would
take about one hour to clear the
smoke out, however, the entire
process took about two hours.

Huge fans were brought in and
the roof door was opened to as-
sist in clearing the smoke.

At around 6 a.m., students
were permitted to return to their
rooms. Because the elevators
were turned off, returning stu-
dents were forced to climb as
many as 22 flights of stairs to

Galpern said that the rock

”Amnesty adopts prisoners of

BEIRUT, Lebanon — A pro-
Iranian Iraqi Kurdish group
claimed Monday it kidnapped
three Italian engineers in northern
Iraq and demanded the with-
drawal of Italian ships from the

Persian Gulf.

The statement, signed by the

~- Iraqi Kurdistan National Union,

said the three engineers were ab-

3 ducted to protest ”ltaIian aid to
‘ the Iraqi regime and Italian mili-
' I tary presence in the gulf waters.”

The typewritten Arabic state-

I -ment was delivered to a Western
news agency office in Moslem
* » west Beirut shortly after nightfall.

Iraq is Iran's enemy in the
7-year-old gulf war. The Iranian
government supports Kurdish re-
bel factions in northern Iraq.

Also Monday, Iraqi jet fighters

fired an exocet missile at a Greek-

owned tanker in the gulf, killing
at least one crew member.

The jets also reportedly raided
five oil and industrial centers

- across Iran.

Meanwhile, in an effort to curb
talk of a U.S. arms embargo

against Iran, Iranian leaders'an-

nounced Iran now makes two-

"thirds of its own weapons and

ammunition.
Bush officially begins
chase for presidency

HOUSTON — Vice President
George Bush, saying America
needs strong and stable leader-
ship instead of ”radical new
directions,” Monday declared his
candidacy for the 1988 Republi-

can presidential nomination.
”For seven years now, I have

been with a president, and I have

seen what crosses that big desk,"

Bush said. ”And who should sit .

at that desk? I am that man.”
In a wide—ranging speech pre-

pared for Bush's formal an-

nouncement in his hometown of

Houston, the vice president sig-
naled that he would hew closely
to President Reagan's major poli-

cy stands, both in domestic and"

foreign policy areas. ,

”I am not going to raise your
taxes — period,” said Bush,
launching his second, campaign
for the presidency.-

Bush talked hopefully of reach-
ing historic arms control treaties
with the Soviets, but urged ”a
healthy skepticism" of the Krem-
lin’s ‘motives.

Bush also pledged to ”help the if

freedom fighters of the world
fight for freedom” in Afghanistan,
Africa and Nicaragua.

”In a place called Nicaragua,”
he said, ”we will help the Con-

tras win democracy. This doc?"

trine of democracy must thunder
on."

Although he did not talk specif-
ically of the series of legal
problems that have confronted

people who either worked for the

. Reagan administration or had ties

to it, Bush urged greater integrity
in American life.

”|ncreasing|y, we see those

who have dropped their stan- I

dards along the way” to success-
ful careers, he said. ”There’s
greed on Wall Street and graft in
City Hall. There's influence-
peddling in Washington, and it's
all so shameful." " .
Bush served two terms 3n ;.the
House and held key appointive

positions during the Nixon-énd'

Ford administrations.

Pro-Iranian Kurds say they kidnapped 3 Italians

roads in South Florida and ham-
pered the morning rush hour.
There were long lines at gas sta-
tions and on highways as people
fled inland, and grocery store
shelves were stripped bare of bat-
teries, bread and other supplies.
The approaching storm cut
power lines along the southwest
coast and schools were closed to-
day in many areas. . _ "
Floyd went from a tropical
storm to a minimal hurricane
when its wind reached 75 mph,
just ‘beyond the 74 mph
threshold, by 8 a.m., then in-
creased to 80 mph by 10 a.m.
Wind gusting to 60 mph
whipped seas around the Fort
Jefferson National Monument,
forcing boaters and rangers to
seek shelter in the Civil War-era

battlements 65 miles west of Key '

West. .

The storm ”turned a little earli-
er” than expected, meaning it
likely would hit on the southwest
tip of Florida this afternoon, said
National Hurricane Center fore-
caster Ken Gross.

the various commitee members
to hear first-hand reports of the
experiences of the winners and
keep students in touch with the
people who paid for their trips,”
said E. Maxine Bruhns, director of
the nationality rooms programs.
. Scholarships for the Irish,

ber of different countries, like
Russia, Hungary, France, En-

Bruhns remarked, ”We want
them to spread and report their
experiences and to study.”

The nationality rooms and in-
tercultural exchange programs
have been awarding grants for
summer study abroad annually
since 1948. To be eligibTé,"sIt'u—
dents must have a QPA of 2.75
or above and 60 to 90 credits.
The student also has to find a pro-

THE PITT NEWS -

Heyward’s gains could become Pitt's loss

Tuesday, October I3, 1987 J‘ 

OK, so the 'Pitt‘Panthers came
out this past Saturday night and
played their best_ half of football
(against competent competition)
in years. Textbook time-
consuming drives, and wide-
open ”Here We Come” offense
paved the way for Mike Gott-
fried’s biggest win as Pitt's head
coach. _ g '

So why the onslaught of points
all of a sudden? Well, it seems
Gottfried had his repressed quar-
terback Sal Genilla firing aerials
into the Notre Dame secondary,
and blooping those tricky shuffle
dumps to ”|ronhead" Heyward
for some big yards. In all, Genil-

la (or as Notre Dame's Lou Holtz '

would call him, Gianella) had
seven‘ timely completions on
twelve timely attempts.
Speaking of Heyward, he
churned out 65 yards on his own

23 carries. The new Lou Riddick
ripped off 41 yards on eight att-
tempts, including a 13-yard shot
that kept the Panthers second
touchdown drive alive and well.
Why, even the previously
deemed immobile Genilla picked
up 27 yards with his newfound
scrambling "ability.

But keep in mind, all of these
wonderful offensive antics oc-
cured in the first half, and the Pitt
Panthers strutted into their lock-
eroom with a 27-0 nation’s
attention-getter. And for what lit-
tle time the Irish had the ball —
seven minutes, 45 seconds in all
— Pitt's defense pretty much
made that Tim Brown fella forget
what the Heisman Trophy was,
and yielded an unusual goose
egg as Notre Dame's first half
point production. '

Now, after hearing all these

WVU losspays

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

The Pitt women's tennis team

had mixed results in last week's

matches. They lost to West Vir-
ginia, 8-1, but bounced back to
defeat Slippery Rock, 7-2.

' By splitting the games, the Lady
Panthers ran their record to 6-5.

In the West Virginia match,

‘ Tracy Feltingoff, Pitt's No. 1 seed, _

lost to Kathy Hall in straight sets
2-6, 1-6. No. 2 seed Carrie de-
Vera made it close in the second
set but lost to Shelley Stead 3-6,
6-7. A
Lena Thoren of WVU con-
tinued the run of victories as she
defeated Bonnie Kartzman 6-1,
6-3, and Dana Watts defeated
Gwen Mclntyre 6-3, 6-3.

Debbie Wituski of wvu had a

tough time with Pitt's Sharon Jaffe ‘

in the first set, but held on and
won 7-5, 6-2.

After five straight defeats, San-
dy Hunt stopped any chance of
aWVU shutout by defeating Julie
Cikerni, 6-4, 7-5.

In the doubles competition, it
was all West Virginia. V

Hall and Stead defeated the
Lady Panthers’ Feltingoff and
Kartzman 6-1, 6-0. WVU’s Tho-
ren and Watts defeated deVera
and Mclntyre 6-1, 7-6.

marked the only game where the
outcome was decided by a third

Twins defeat Tigers, 9-5, clinch AL crown 

By John Nelson
AP Sports Writer

DETROIT —- The Minnesota
Twins, bucking inexperience and
the odds, beat the Detroit Tigers
9-5 Monday and won their first
American League pennant in 22
years behind the pitching of Bert
Blyleven and the all-around play
of Gary Gaetti.

With -the worst record of any
World Series team since the 1973

New York Mets and theworst 

set. WVU’s Wituski and Amy
Schlien held offJaffe and Jill Co-
hen 6-2, 4-6, 7-6.

Although the Panthers took a
beating from West ‘Virginia,
women's tennis coach George
Dieffenbach thinks this may ac-
tually help the Lady Panthers
down the road. .

”If you look, at the results, this 9

team usually beats us 8-1, 9-0 or
7-2 every year. The games wer-
en’t blowouts. It was good com-
petition. It was a close set, the
third set. We had two match
points, but we lost it. Sandy Hunt
came up with a great win,” said
Dieffenbach.

”We played indoors and that's
not always easy to do. We played
in their new gym, and the floor
had lines all the way across for-
different sports. -It was hard to
concentrate,” Dieffenbach
added.

In the Slippery Rock match, Pitt
won on the strength of the No. 2
through No. 6 single seeds, all
coming away with victories._

Tracy Feltingoff had to oppose
Slippery Rock's top—seeded play-
er and lost in three sets to Lisa Os-
tergaard 6-1, 2-6, 4-6.

deVera needed three sets to di-
spos’e of Lisa Howe 6-4, 1-6, 6-4,
as did teammate Bonnie Kartz-

man over Amy Tocco 4-6, 6-3, .

6-2. ,
Mclntyre had a relatively easy

road record of any pennant win-
ner, the Twins took two of three
at Detroit to win the best-of-seven
playoffs in five games.

Tom Brunansky drove in two
runs with a double in Minneso-
ta’s four-run second inning, then
homered with one out in the
ninth — when the Twins scored

‘their final three runs — giving

him six extra-base hits in the ser-
ies, including a pair of homers.

Pitt's 5th- and 6th— seeded sin-
gles players,’ Jaffe and Hunt,
defeated Slippery Rock's Stacy
Mosley and Debbie Bond by
identical scores of 6-3, 6-2.

In the doubles, Tracy Feltingoff
was able to avenge her singles"
loss by teaming with Kartzman in
defeating Ostergaard and Howe
7-6, 6-3.

In the second-seeded doubles
match,_deVera and Mclntyre had
trouble with Tocco and Mosely,
taking the match into three sets,
but the Lady Panthers prevailed
6-2, 2-6, 6-3. Slippery Rock's
Koeners and Gretchen Hartman
defeated Jaffe and Cohen to close
out the match.

”West Virginia is more superi-
or of a team than Slippery Rock,
but Slippery Rock took us to a lot
of three matches,” said
Dieffenbach. _

”Losing to West Virginia paid
dividends for us over Slippery
Rock. That loss gave momentum
to the players, and it showed
against Slippery Rock.

”Playing West Virginia, Tem-
ple, Penn State and Bucknell
gives us a chance to play some
good Division I schools,”
Dieffenbach added.

As of this writing, the team is
playing Youngstown State. Today
they will face St. Francis at the

' Lemon off Juan Berenguer. The

home run was the 14th hit in the
series breaking the playoff mark
set twice in NL series.

Jeff Reardon came on for the fi-”

nal four outs for his second save
of the playoffs. He was also the
winning pitcher in Game 1.
The Twins, who won only
three of 13 road trips-this season,
came into the playoffs as under-
dogs. They won the first two at
home, however, then finished it
here, ending Detroit's bid for a
second World-Series appearance
in four seasons. Whenthe Tigers

won the 1984 World Series, Gib-
son was the playoff MVP.

The Twins won it not only with
hitting, however. The best defen-
sive team statistically in the
league, they made one fine
defensive play after another to
keep the Tigers off base.

Kirby Puckett said it for his
teammates the night before. ”No-

‘body expected us to do any-

thing,” he said. ”... But it didn't
worry us. We didn't listen.”

Young and emotional, the
Twins beat not only the Tigers,
but also the odds to win the

worth,” the Panther offense
seemed to be saying.

Just as long as we can barely
hold on,” ’cause a win is a win,”
as Gottfried likes to say.

Just as a loss is a loss. So what,
Craig Heyward had his sixth con-
secutive lOO—yard rushing effort.
He carried the ball a whopping
42 times, and gained only 132
yards (to makeit sound some-
what more impressive, let's call
it 396 feet)’. That averages out to
a little better than three yards per
carry. Big deal. ‘

What the Pitt football program
has to realize is that Hey-Diddle-
Diddle, Heyward-up—the-middle
isn't doing the job, since six and
seven and eight tacklers areal-
ways around to get in on the
feeding frenzy. ”lronhead” is
more effective in the open field,

where poor defensive backs and
outside linebackers have to tan-
go with him, as George Michael
says, ”one—on-one.”

Just ask Benny Blades, the
bruising University of Miami
defensive back who got flattened
on national television last year by
a Heyward stiff—arm in a dual
sprint down the" sideline.

So the second half of Pitt—ND
was nothing more than a short-
ened version of the Panthers’
matchups with Temple and
Boston College — no bombs to
Tuten and Osborn. No shuffle
passes to trip up the defense. No
Genilla bullets to stretch the
defense. Just ”lronhead” Hey-
ward runs and Pitt playing not to
lose, in a game where a loss is
still a loss.

It's gonna come back to haunt
‘em. '

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, October I3, I987

By Alan Robinson

V AP Sports Writer

Strike or no strike, Pittsburgh
Steelers Coach Chuck Noll finds
himself coaching a .500 team.

- The Steelers’ regulars were 1-1

before the NFL strike and their

substitutes are 1-1 in the
replacement-team games. Noll
isn't certain if there's a con-
nection.

. ”The team that makes the big
plays usually wins,” Noll said
Monday at his weekly news con-
ference. ”We made them in At-
lanta last week, the Rams made
them [Sunday]. it was a learning

experience for a lot of our guys.” -

The Rams blocked a punt for
their first touchdown, then turned
the ball over to former Southern
Cal tailback Charles White, who

carried 33 times for 166 yards '

and altouchdown.

While most NFL teams kept

their offensive schemes relative-
ly simple during the first week of
replacement games, Noll said the
Rams ”ran about everything you
can run at our nose tackle [Mike
Minter]. They stunted him,
shoved him, sealed him and
trapped him
everything a nose tackle can see.

Noll pointed to wide receiver
Joey Clinkscales, who madessix
catches for 150 yards against the
Falcons but was held to one
reception by the Rams.

”There was a lot more attention
paid to him this week,” Noll said.
”You’ve got to be able to respond
to that. You have to be able to do
it week in and week out, whether
they're paying attention to you or
not.” .

Noll isn't certain whether the

All the video reviewers agree
that the Proton monitor televisions are
the best. The critics point out that
Proton T.V.'s have true blacks and
whites, 15% more picture, [you can
read all the subtitles]; a sharper pic-
ture: and straight lines [a real foot-
ball field is not curved on the ends].

Don't be misled by competitive
sets which only advertise that they
are as bright, or claim that they have
more lines of resolution, and have
more knobs to play with. Cut through
the confusion by putting these T.V.'s
to the performance test. Come to

teams with an edge in experience
will necessarily keep their advan-
tage if the replacement teams
continue to play.

The Steelers are at home Sun-
day against the Indianapolis
Colts, who were 0-2 before the

. str‘,i1<e but are 2-0 with replace-

mr§.'ht players. The Colts beat the
New York Jets 6-0 Sunday despite

. failing to score a touchdown.

”l don't know ifthe number of
regulars you have is going to play
a part in it,” said Noll, who re-

fused to speculate whether any
more veteran Steelers would
report this week. ”You need

good performances from guys
who aren't regulars or starters 
we're coming off a loss, and
sometimes coming off a loss is as
good a motivator as there is.”

Noll said he wasn't disappoint-
ed with quarterback Steve Bono,
who completed only 11 of 28
passes for 136 yards, and doesn't
plan to replace him with backup
Reggie Collier.

”Steve has the advantage of
having been in training camp
with us, and he has a good grasp
of what we're trying to do, and
he's spent a lot of time studying
the offense,” Noll said.

Lyneal Alston, a rookie free
agent from Southern Mississippi,
will replace Russell Hairston at
wide receiver after making three
catches for 84 yards and two

touchdowns. Hairston, the top

offensive player last summer in

Arena Football, has made only

one catch in two games.
Veteran quarterback Gary

Hogeboom had led the Colts in '

their two strike games, but may
not play Sunday because of a rib
injury. Hogeboom was 15 of 28
for 115 yards against the Jets af-
ter throwing five TD passes the
week before against Buffalo.
