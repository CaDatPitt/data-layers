“Weisband Wins SG Bid
With   96-lg/ote Margin  

BY BILL MOORE

Barry Weisband won his second.

bid for Student Government Board
(SGB) president Friday night.
defeating the winner of the first
election. Joe Gronsky. by 96 votes.

A total of 1,840 votes were cast,
compared to 1,655 in the first

-\:...4’election two weeks ago, for an

increase of 185 votes cast.

The 24-hour deadline for election
contests passed Saturday evening,
and the Weisband victory is
expected to remain unchallenged.

He lost the first election to

Gronsky by 32 votes, but contested’

the vote because of election
irregularities. That election was
declared invalid by the Student
Government Election Committee
(SGEC), and Gronsky was unsuc-
cessful in his appeal of the
decision. ~

In the latest voting, Weisband
pulled 878 votes. Gronsky received
'~ ' 782. Larry Chaban received 88 and
Mark Satinoff received 80.

Pay/no-pay

Ticket Compromise

A BY BILL MOORE

Reversing its earlier approval of
a pay system for student football
tickets, the Chancellor's Commit-
tee on Ticket Distribution adopted
a compromise pay/no-pay proposal
Friday.

The compromise system allows
for no-cost. first-come. first-served
distribution of student tickets
during the five-day period preced-
mg each game. -If, however. a
student does not want to wait in
line, or wants. to be guaranteed
seating at each home game. he
couldpay $3 for a season ticket.

Student seating will be limited,
probably to this year's ﬁgure of
l0.0lO seats. under the proposal
offered by student committee
member Jim Gervase.

Gervase's pay/no-pay system
was approved by a 6-3 vote at
Friday's closed session. The ﬁnal
version, after technical stumbling
blocks are removed, will be

i/Stlbntittcd to _Chancellor Wesley
‘Posvar for his approval or rejection.
Gervase. who -“previously had

’ f~_‘t.>‘te.d ,-.witl1,.~.th'e. -majority» of . the,-

 

Chaban and Satinoff, after a poor
showing in the first election,
campaigned only minimally for the
second contest.

“I'm just sorry it had to take so
long to decide who would lead the
Board," Weisband said yesterday.

,“I know we have to start work

quickly."

He said it was obvious from the
low voter turnouts that
students still don’t care who wins
the SGB presidency, and reiterated
the perennial SGB theme of raising
interest. ’

Gronsky said yesterday he was
disappointed, but not bitter. “I
hope all the groups that endorsed
me will throw their support behind
Barry and make this as strong a
Board as possible," he said.

About 14% of the approximately

vl3.000 eligible undergradutes

voted in the second election,
compared with 12.3%_ in the ﬁrst.
Weisband attributed the slight
increase to stepped-up campaign-
ing by him and‘ Gronsky.

He listed development of a
campus co-op that would offer
low-cost food, records, stationery,
supplies and other small items
students often purchase as one of
his key objectives for the coming
year.

Weisband, along with Board
members-elect Chip Hubbard,
Larry Gleason, Larry Krain, Benita
Marcus, Sue Turner and Robin
Wertkin. will be inaugurated
tomorrow at 6 p.m. in the S.U.
Ballroom.

Voting Thursday and Friday was
heaviest in the Towers lobby,
-where 846 votes were recorded,
followed by the Student Union,

» 362; the Cathedral, 288; Benedum

Hall 271. and Scaife Hall. 60.,

committee for a $1-per-game pay
system, said he decided students
preferred free tickets, even if it
meant limited seating. “Students
have told me they don't see a need.
for more than" 10,010 seats, and
thev: don't want to Dav." he said.

“To me, the $3 season ticket is
just an added advantage,” he
continued. “It is up to the student
to decide which is more valuable.
his time or his $3."

Gervase's motion received the
approval of the other student

committee members who had»

opposed the pay system approved
on Jan. 23 by a vote of 5-3.

The approval of the pay system
last month met with criticism from
numerous students and student
organizations. but the reversal was
not expected.

Because Friday's meeting was
listed as a closed session by
committee chairman Dr. Kenneth
Metz. the committee decided to
hold an open meeting Thursday to
hear students‘ reactions to the
proposed system.

The committee also agreed

Student Lobby Thwct rts itself’:

BY CRIS HALL

This past weekend's scheduled
meeting of the state-related mem-
bers of the Pennsylvania Student
Lobby (PSL), at which that group's
future plan of action concerning
possible tuition hikes and other
issues was to be decided, faile_d to
come about when two of the four
delegations didn’t show up.

Student representatives from
Pitt, Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln had agreed to meet in Pitt's
Student Government offices at 2
p.m. Saturday, but the only people

to show up on time were Pitt's;

representatives and a high-school
student representing Pitt's Young
Socialists.

Adopted

tickets to accommodate as many

- students as possible, and consider-

ed distribution at different point_s
on campus.

“Date and spouse" tickets also
were discussed, but the Committee
did not reach formal agreement on
the cost.

Student member Marty Doerfler.
one of the supporters of the

x Gervase compromise, asked that

provisions be incorporated in the
system for use of the money

‘generated by the $3 season ticket

sales.

“The money from date tickets
should go to the athletic depart-
ment." he said. “but the $3
monies. if more is raised than it
takes to cover the cost of the
system. should go into an account
to benefit students who attend
football games."

Final approval of Gervase's
proposal. with possible amend-
ments or changes. is expected at
Thursday's meeting (and presum-

\ ably will be subniitted to the
» *Cl1.anlccl.|s>r ..soQn..aftetwards.... * ~

_- \_.

  

The Pitt delegation consisted of

Chip Hubbard, representing the
outgoing Student Government
Board (SGB), Larry Gleason,
representing the present SGB and
conference organizer Greg Glister,
who, though not currently enrolled
in school, was Pitt's delegate to the
last PSL meeting.

“The meeting was set up. so that
the state-related schools could get
together and decide what to do, if

anything,” Glister said after noting I

the state-operated and private
schools apparently had already
decided on their,own courses of
action.

The Temple delegation, which
flew in from Philadelphia, arrived

late. Penn State and Lincoln never

arrived. 2

Among otherithings the two
groups discussed the governor's
recent budget proposal, tuition,

student,government and housing at

Pitt and Temple and the availability
of alcoholic beverages at the two
campuses.

You can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other people have done it. People who
have different jobs, different I05, different interests, different educations have
completed the course. Our graduates are people from all walks of life. These
people have all taken a course developed by Evelyn Wood, a prominent
—::u'ucator. Practically all of them at least tripled their reading speed with equal or
better comprehension. Most have increased it even more.

Think for a moment what that means. All of them—even the slowest—now read
an average novel in less than "two hours. They read an entire issue of Time or
Newsweek in 35 minutes. They don't skip or skim. They read every word. They
use no machines. Instead, they let the material they're reading determine how
fast they read. And mark this well: they actually understand more, remember
more, ‘and enjoy more than when they read slowly. That's right! They
understand more. They remember more. They enjoy more. You can do the same

gl Shapp’s Pittverdict _

It's like one thing after another these days.‘ First there was a
contested Student Government election, increases in room and board
were announced, then the ad hoc Tickets Committee wavered on a

v no-pay system for next year’s football games, then the vote on a faculty

_ , union was set for a month from tomorrow, and if that doesn’t beat all,

Gov. Milton Shapp just armounced his suggested appropriation for
Pitt, which is far shortof what the University’s was asking. So now the
tuition-hike rumors are ﬂying. ‘

6 It's not that we haven't come to expect such moves on the part of
Shapp, a man whose self-image is so distorted that he thinks he can run
for president, and as a liberal Democrat at that. ' After last year's lobby
in Harrisburg to garner a larger chunk of educational funds, Pitt
student leaders were distressed by the governor’s careless attitude
toward higher education and his obsession about keeping the budget
down. A V

This year, Pitt requested $68.5 million, but Shapp has recommended
$59.9 million. While the ﬁgure must be approved by the State General
Assembly, there is a parallel here with last year’s situation, which
ended up in a 14% tuition hike for Pitt students.

Though administrators say it’s still too early to tell, outgoing Student
Board President Larry Platt believes a hike is in the offing.

That means without getting trigger-happy, students should be
considering what form of action aimed in which direction should be
taken to avert an increase similar to last year's.

Even though the next move belongs to the general assembly, there’s

6 nothing to stop students from sitting down with school officials/ and

legislators to go over the limited range of options.
New Board President

Congratulations to the new Student Government Board (SGB)
president long have been in order. Unfortunately, it was 15 days after
the votes ﬁrst were counted before we knew who he was.

Students must support the new administration of President Barry
Weisband or face certain defeat in the many issues that lie ahead this
year.

Gleason, Chip Hubbard, l.ariy Krain, Benita Marcus, Sue Turner and
Robin Wertkin. In their campaign interviews,’ they showed the typical
willingness and enthusiasm to tackle their new ‘jobs.’ We hope as
always this zeal becomes an integral part of each Board member’s
attitude, and not just a remnant of pre-election euphoria.

The topics that will provide the Board's work long have been
developing independently of the new representatives; we think these
issues are fairly obvious. .

One that is not so recognizable, but hazardous nonetheless, is the

possibility of alienating those factions whose candidate lost in the hotly H‘
A contested presidential race. Joe Gronsky, winner of the invalidated

heat, set a good example by urging students to back Weisband and
make the new administration one of the best on record. If the students
at large are to beneﬁt from the new Board's leadership, they can do so
only when, like Gronsky, they are ready to follow. »
Conceming the more common problems, we suggest the Board move
swiftly on faculty unionization and on the possible tuition hike. With
the union issue ﬁnally coming to a head, it’s necessary that the Board
investigate which avenue will best suit the cause of students. A tuition
hike, though not as new an issue as unionization, is a bread-and-butter
concern and therefore something that can cost a Board its
respectability if handled improperly.
All in all, the prospects are for a busy Board this year. We have no
choice but ‘to wish it well and lend it support.

It is on this point of ignorance
that I must take serious exception

Virtues of

On behalf of the Food Service
Committee, I am writing in reply to
yourarticleof Jan. 28, by Tom
Waseleski. ‘concerning the Pizza
Eating Contest of Feb. 7, 1976.

t l have to question the ethics of
Tom Waseleski; when he makes
such an unsubstantiated and
demeaning remark as: “While it is
unnecesary to speak for the student
Food Committee since they have
enough going against them," this
definitely cannot go unchallenged.

objectives. 1 think we can see the

cheap attack that The Pitt News"

seems to~be displaying with
increased ' regularity these past

few weeks in their editorial pages.

are looking for leadership against
the establishment. They. are a
weapon to be used, not a mind to
be heeded. .

Our own contemporaries, those
who did not go to college . but
became mechanics and truck
drivers, cannot be the elite. Rather,
they are uneducated goons who
voted for Nixon despite our pleas
for them to join our self-righteous
youth movement.

So, the role of elite falls to us, the
college generation. We win this
role not by any inherent virtue, but
by default. We were fortunate
enough to be able to take four years
of our lives and dedicate them to
more educated illusions.

' The trouble is that we take this
role seriously. We have consistent-
ly ignored reality, more content
with wet-dream utopian visions of"
how the world should’ he.‘
Somehow, we cannot accept the
role of greasy, oversized school-

children, so we overcompensate.

Where do we go from here? Do
we drop out of school or still play
the fool? Even more important,
does this thing we get eal'led«an
education really qualify us for this
role we desire? Or does the role
automatically_eome upon achieving
education? .

Unfortunately, the only “strong,

Despite all the strategy and
defense plans, cockroaches appar-
ently are in Oakland to stay. .

“They're awfully hard to get rid
of," said a spokesman for the
Allegheny County Health De-
partment.

“A lot of Oakland landlords are
happy to have their buildings

fumigated, but with buildings so
close together. roaches can come
right back if the neighboring
Iandlord‘isn’t willing to have his
house exterminated.”

So Oakland residents seem
doomed to draw chalk lines around
their kitchens, daring pests to come
across, and arm themselves with
cans of Raid in case their roaches
are audacious enough to call their
bluff.

Eighteen   Tearrts Gorge
At RSA Pizza Contest 

BY ADELE DONOHUE

. The tinkling of a" cowbell
sounded the beginning of the Pizza
Eating Contest on Saturday after-
noon in Towers Cafeteria C.

The Resident Student’ Associa-
tion provided the prize money for
the sloppy event, which was
organized and staffed by the Food
Service Committee.

Eighteen male-female teams
entered the contest.

Surrounded by a circle of noisy
fans, Donna Weidner and Dennis
Bubar ate their way through 39
pieces of pizza to the first prize of
$lO0. The $50 second prize was
captured by Claudia Huber and
Miguel Rivera, who devoured 37
pieces.’ Ken Kallish and Ellen
Freed consumed 35 pieces for the
$25 third prize.

- J,h\.

The contest was divided into four
12-minute segments, with a few
short breaks, during which contes-
tants mopped the cheese and
tomato paste off their faces or

gulped quick glasses of water.

In the first section, the couples
were blindfolded and the women
fed the men. They switched roles in
the second part. Mouths were often

missed and many faces were
‘bathed in orange sauce.
In the third segment, the

blindfolds were removed and the

catch up in the final segment, in
which each one fed himself.

 “Power and Pace"

V A A BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT
, Every» now and then a ballet

 ' 1 A. comes along which acts as a perfect
showcase for the various talents of

a"dance company. La Sylphide is
that" type of ballet and the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre last

’weekend' at Heinz Hall took full
' advantage of it.

In V addition to providing the

V company with .the material for

brilliant solos and pas de deux, La
‘Sylphide boasts a story line with

  the. power and pace to completely

captivate an audience.

La Sylphide refers to a m3¢hoIog-
ical spirit of the air, usually found
in the forest. In this ballet, Dagmer
Kessler plays the sylph, who
entices James (Alexander Filipov)
-from his intended marriage to a
.local Scottish girl, Effie, danced by
Deidre Salyer.

Their love is foiled by an evil
witch, played to perfection by
Artistic Director Frederic Franklin,
who causes James to accidentally

I kill his sylph and then strikes him

dead. Sad, but beautiful.»
On the individual level, Kessler
and Filipov were typecast as the

' sylph and her Scottish lover. Her

incredible lightness and his pas-
sionate leaps worked beautifully,
both alone and in contrast.

Throughout, the magical quality of.

Kessler’s dancing, coupled with
the ﬁlmy white costume and the
tiny transparent wings, lent a
fairytale ambience to the stage.
Another pleasant surprise ,was
the excellence of the corps,

 Ballet Showcase for Talents

 

“The sylph,” Dagmar Kessler in the Pittsburgh Ballet" Theatre’s

production of La Sylphide.

particularly the attending sylphs.
For once, their presence on stage
was both necessary and enjoyable.‘

The production also enjoyed the
benefit’ of harmonious sets and
costuming. During-the first act,
the action takes place in an early
19th Century Scottish farmhouse.
Filipov, and the corps, as friends of
the engaged couple, wear plaids
representing several Scottish clans.
It is to their credit that these
costumes looked not only believ-
able, but graceful.

Much more could be said about
the Ballet Theatre's latest produc-
tion. But there’s no need for
accolades. The performance spoke-
for itself. '

He’s regarded in some circles as

‘I776’ Not Another 
Bicentennial Leftovercei

BY KARAN REKASIE

1776 is not another of those
abundant Bicentennial objects,
some curiously stamped, “Tai-
wan." It has a witty script that
might have been written by
Benjamin Franklin hims_elf (al-
though the book was written by
Peter Stone and the score by
Sherman Edwards). Its cast is as
fervent as newly hatched patriots.

Adams. portrayed by Jerry
Communale Jr., is a fiercely
independent and articulate man
who declares he is not liked and
even drives Franklin to call him a
“Boston ﬁshwife.” Communale
also directed and staged the entire
production.

Franklin, played by G. Fred

' Thickey, is a rotund, good-natured

man whose scraggy white wig
seems to fall from his bald dome,
but who never loses his wit or
innuendoes. '

Other major characters include -

Richard Henry Lee (John Croyle), a
well-liked ‘but bumptious fellow
persuaded by Adams and Franklin
to present Adams’ proposal to
Then there’s young

 Freshman Wayne Williams

scored 14 of his game-high 19
_ -‘points,in the second half, leading
an aroused Panther basketball
-_‘j?ﬁ'team to a satisfying 71-67 win over

the Syracuse Orangemen Saturday
night before an enthusiastic Field

' ‘House crowd of 3,000.

Pitt (8-13) was dealt a -severe

 blow before game time when Larry
 Harris learned of a severe illness in
 his family. Ordinarily, this would
 have been enough to count the-

Panthers out, but Harris performed‘

 _well in a trying situation and his
QL. teammates rallied behind their
(leader to deal Syracuse (15-4) its

ﬁrst loss in eight starts.

’ ' _ The game began as a defensive

struggle, with _ Pitt's tenacious
“amoeba" giving Syracuse prob-
lems from the start. .

Jim “Bug” Williams, the Or-

ange's’ leading scorer, was inef-

fective the entire game after having

tl~.his ﬁrst two ﬁeld goal attempts
- rejected by Willie Kelly and Harris,

respectively. Williams finished

‘ rwithﬁve points, well below his

season average of over 16.

With Scott Nedrow, Wayne

 Williams and Bob Shrewsbury
’ harrassing Orange ball handlers

-~ defense asserted itself early. Pitt’s

and Harris and Kelly

offense had a little trouble catching
up with the defense, so the score
was only 17-15, Pitt, by the time
the first period was half over.
Panther coach Tim Grgurich
made his first substitution at that
time, and senior guard Tom
Richards immediately gave the
offense a spur with a jumper and an
assist. Syracuse came right .back

1 , however, and had tied the game at

21-21 when, at the 6:33 mark of the

first half, potential disaster struck
the Panthers.

Harris, driving to the hoop,
failed to consider that Orange
captain Chris Sease would probably
be waiting for him -underneath.
There was a fearful collision, with
Harris taking the worst of it and
falling to the ﬂoor, clutching his
head.

Harris had to be taken out, but
saw enough second-half action to
allow him to ﬁnish with 14 points
and 10 rebounds.

Jim Williams took advantage of
Harris'_absence, his jumper giving
the Orange a,23-21 lead. The teams
traded leads until the end of the
half and Syracuse took a 32-31 lead

into the locker room.

Syracuse maintained their lead
for four minutes of the second half,
but Wayne Williams maneuvered

his way inside for two, quick

buckets to even the score at 38’
points. Pitt got the lead for good
when Scott Nedrow scored on a
break to put the Panthers ahead,
40-39.

Syracuse, coach Ray Danforth

drew a technical foul in an effort to-

inspire his shaken team, but the
move backﬁred. A Shrewsbury
jumper and a fantastic hanging
drive by Williams put Pitt up by
seven, 50-43. _

The situation remained the same
until, with a little over seven
minutes left, the Panthers made
the move that won them the game.

Pitt was leading by eight when
Harris made an outstanding
defensive play- on a Syracuse
inbounds play to give the Panthers

‘the ball under the Syracuse basket.

Williams capitalized with another
great move underneath, and then
Shrewsbury came up with the
Orange's inbounds pass.
Shrewsbury made a great pass tr

Larry Newill is a ﬁne goaltender,
but he is not a miracle worker.

Though Newill turned in another
respectable performance, the 51
shots he faced from the University

in ‘of Cincinnati Bearcats on Saturday
u night proved to be too much, as the

outmatched Pitt Hockey Club fell

In three games against Pitt in
1976, the Bearcats rolled up 32
goals while allowing the Panthers
’ The Hockey Club
stepped up its schedule this year
with hopes of ﬁnding better
competition, but may have taken a
bigger step than imagined by
putting Cincinnati on the card.

‘ The Bearcats are going to
engage in varsity competition next
season and, from the display they
put on at the Sewickley Arena, it’s
easy to see why. Cincinnati not
only outshot the Panthers, but also

outskated them and beat them to .

the puck throughout the game,
‘limiting Pitt to only 15 shots on

' goal.

.The key, though, was the
Panthers’ inability to clear the puck
out of their own zone, something
they got away with against Ohio
University last week. Cincinnati
skaters were constantly open for
good, hard shots, and one- and
two-rebound attempts were also
common.

“We got hammered," said
Coach Barcalow, “We've got to
start playing fundamental hockey
and we've got to start knocking a
few guys down around the net."

' ~ ' Perhaps another key was the

absence of Rick Vernon, who can
contribute on both offense and the
backline. Vernon, who seems to
dominate the action on the ice,

@ missed the contest because of a
, bout with the flu.

B’ ealo

 

Barcalow isn’t using the lack of
practice as an alibi, but it is clearly
the main reason the Panthers failed
to play as a team against Ohio and
Cincinnati. With a game at Penn

‘State set for Sunday (the Drexel

game has been canceled due to lack
of funds for'the trip), Pitt once
again will ﬁnd the going: tough
against another team that will turn
varsity next season.

“Penn State has its own rink,”
Barcalow said,» “and they’re
probably onthe ice every day for
two or three hours. When you have
your practice, you're going to be
top dollar." V

The Panthers were also plagued

_ by costly (and unnecessary) penal-

ties and found themselves playing
two men ,' down in the opening
period on three different occasions.
There were many roughing and
ﬁghting calls, and a near-brawl
marred the first intermission. The
referees called the game with 2:25

remaining because of an outbreak’

in the ﬁnal period.

  

HOOPERS LAND HOT PROSPECT

— On the subject of basketball, it
seems the Panthers’ fortunes are
looking up a bit. Mike Rice, one of
the most sought-after recruits in
the country, has signed a letter of
intent with Pitt.

The 6-8, 215-pound scoring and

rebounding machine from Freder-.

ick, Maryland, led his Thomas
Johnson High School team to the
state championship last year,
averaging 26.4 points per game.

This season, Rice is averaging
30-plus points and 15 rebounds a
game.‘ Several scouting services
have listed him among the top two
forward prospects in the country,'
and his addition to the Panther
program can provide a needed
boost. -

“He's just a great player and a
total youngman," said Pitt Coach
Tim Grgurich. “At this early time

I in thelrecruiting season and with

the way our kids are playing now,
this .. is a" great’ thing for our
program. ' "We're 3 re

ally excited.

 
   

Harris underneath and Larry
tipped the pass into the hoop
before falling to the court. The
Panthers were up by 12 with little
more than six minutes remaining.

Syracuse made a valiant try at a
comeback, pulling to within ﬁve on
Kevin James’ two free throws at
the 2:36, mark. Sophomore Ross
whose place-in the
Orangemen's starting lineup had
been taken by James, replaced Jim

' Williams with 1:36 showing on the

clock and quickly hit two straight
ﬁeld goals to cut Pittsburgh's lead
to two. 67-65. It was going to be yet
another of those close games,
which too often‘ this "year have

turned out to be ‘heartbreakers for

the Panthers.

But this time, the outcome was
different. The Panthers had trouble
with their late ‘free throws, but
out-hustled the Orange in the late
going to hold on to their win.

Joining Williams and Harris in
double figures for Pitt were
Nedrow, who had V 12, and
Shrewsbury, who had 10 points and
a like number of assists. Willie
Kelly chipped in eight points on
four of six attempts from the floor.

Harris’ 10 rebounds led the
Panthers, while Williams grabbed
nine and Kelly had seven. '

Dale Shackleford and James led
the Orange with 13 points apiece,
and Sease added 10 points to his
game-high total of 18 rebounds.

“It was a good win for us," said
a happy Grgurich after the game.

“We’ve set some goals for
ourselves, and this was one of
them,” he went on. “Our next goal
is ‘Nest Virginia.”

-Victories by George O’Korn, Bill
Bailey and Milt Schuler in the ﬁnal
three matches of the meet gave the
Panther matmen the points they so
desperately needed Saturday af-
ternoon, lifting Pitt (11-3) to a 23-31
victory over Lock Haven (14-2) at
the Field House. ‘

Lock Haven had taken command -
early, gaining_ victories in ﬁve of_

the ﬁrst seven classes. Pitt's only
early wins came from All-American
Rande Stottlemyer, in his ﬁrst bout
at 134 since a back injury, and Bill
North, who prevailed at 150.

The Panthers were down 23-12
when'Pitt coach Dave Adams sent
his ﬁnal threesome into battle.
Bailey and O'Korn narrowed the
gap by three and four points,
respectively, with decisions over
their opponents—Bailey’s a 13-0
superior decision.

Thus the stage was set for
Schulef——the junior heavyweight
needing a superior decision to tie
the meet score, and a superior
decision, a default, or a pin, if his
team was to emerge victorious.

Schuler was trailing during the
second period when Lock Haven's
Jim Schuster illegally slammed
Schuler to the mat, disabling the
fallen Panther and forcing the
attending physician to bar Schu-
ler's further participation.

Schuler was awarded a victory by
default and the six points that went
with it gave Pitt a 23-21
eome~from-behind victory. '

“We knew Lock Haven was a

good team going in," said Adams ‘

after the comeback was completed.

- Farmer Zndln 600-,

Qualifies for Nationals  

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Pitt track team had a ﬁne
showing at/the Michigan State
Relays on Saturday, but the young
team's inexperience kept many
good performances from being
outstanding. .

“The quality of the meet was
exceptional," said Coach Mike
Agostinella. “We have a very
young team. A few of the
underclassmen hesitated to go with
the leaders, and that was the

V" difference between theirjplace and

ﬁrst. Our inexperience showed, but
we had some excellent performan-
ces, too." '

Karl Farmer ran his first
600-yard race in two years and was
runner-up with a time of/l:10.7.
That qualiﬁed him for the NCAA's,
but he must do better to insure
placement at the championship
meet. The cut_off time is sometimes
lowered if too many people have
qualiﬁed.

-“Farmer has great natural
ability at this distance but needs to
work on the strategy part of the
race." Agostinella‘ said. “He got-
boxed in and could not maintain
good position." .

The other highlight of the meet
for Pitt was Tom Herrmann's
three—quarter-mile split on the
distance medley relay. Herrmann
took the baton well behind the

_ Mel

leaders and made up much of that
distance. The team of Herrmann,

Rich Moore, Don Betterly and Dave ~

McDonald ﬁnished ﬁfth with a
respectable time of 10:06.

The distance corps fared well’;
Pitt scored in two of three events.
Boyd continued _to show
improvement in the two-mile,
placing_third.with a time of 8:50.4.
Nick Martin ﬁnished ﬁfth with a
4:l3.2 mile, and freshman Bob Lee
ran 14:33 in the three-mile, coming
on strong after a slow start. ,

The Panthers gathered two other

- ﬁfth places, one in the hurdles and

the other in the triple jump. Dan
Schuerleran 8.6 in the highs an_d
Keith Taylor leaped a distance‘ of
46-8 to attain those places. g

Although not many Pitt runners
and jumpers placed, their efforts
were good and their performances
improved. Some of the best teams
in the nation competed at Michigan
and the more experienced track-
stcrs won.

"We gained valuable experience
and conﬁdence at the MSU relays,
Agostinnella said. “Most of the
team gave 100% and that's our
objective. We're building toward a
climax and the big meets are yet to
come." '

Pitt‘s‘next meet will be against
lndiana on Saturday at the Field

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

It was Pantherettes vs. Panther-
ettes yesterday afternoon at the
Field House, and the Pitt squad
topped Federal City, 56-52.

The Federal City Pantherettes,
the preseason favorite to dominate
women’s basketball, have two of
the best players in the sport—6-3
center Sheila “Too Tall” Patterson
and Carolyn “Magic" Montgom-
cry, a 5-4 guard. Both lived up to
their reputations.

Pitt, coming off Saturday night's
74-28 rout of Ohio University, was

Pall too ready to take on what Head
-3

Coach ‘Pat Wallace termed “quality
competition.” And Federal City
proved to be just that. ‘ .

Despite its billing as a promin-
ently offensive team, F.C. can play
defense equally well; both teams

were held scoreless for more than '

two minutes into the first half,
when Debbie Jones connected on a
hook. —

The game could be "termed only
as -“very physical.” The keys
literally were covered with sprawl-
ing bodies, and the splattering of
ﬂesh against the court resounded
with as much frequency as the call
to the free throw line.

Fouls abounded, especially in
the first half. Montgomery, Jones
and Robin Fry seemed to take up
permanent residency on the charity
stripe.

Pitt never lost the lead, although
F.C. tied the score at 28. With 2:47
left in the half, Jones ﬂipped in a
quick bucket, the momentum
picked up and Pitt left for the locker
room with a lead of 34-32.

In the second half, F.C. never
got closer than four points,
whereas Pitt led by as many as 10.

Pitt won the game on its defense.

particularly on an outstanding
performance from 6-1 center Kate
Szramowski. Szramowski chalked
up eight points and collected an
equal number of rebounds, but her
real job was to contain Patterson, a
difficult and obviously painful job
that she did well. '

“We had to give Patterson the
shots," Wallace said. “We had to
hold her off the boards to win.
Kate did a super job.”

“I think we could’ve blown the
game open if Montgomery or

M9n’day:-Fsbti§ety§:9a, ms;-.13-E 

Pantherettes Double Winners

Patterson had fouled out," Wallace
added. “Federal City played a
good game."

Pitt outrebounded F.C., 56-35.
Patterson led in that category with
18, while Jones was high for Pitt
with 14 and Barb Welsh brought
down 11. —

Patterson and Montgomery were
the game’s top scorers with 19 and

17 points, respectively. Fry led-Pitt

with 15, and Jones scored 14.
The victory marks the last home
game for the Pantherettes until

Feb. 25, when they meet lndian_a. __ 

The road trip promises to.be the
toughest _part of the. season,

bringing encounters with Slippery _ J” a,

Rock, Penn State and Cheyney
State, the winner of the Pitt
Invitational.

Wallace described the victory , 
over Federal City simply: “We had " " ‘

a plan, the kids executed it well.”

An understatement by any ‘

definition. What the Pantherettes

did was prove themselves, once 3 ~“ ‘

and for all, as a quality team.

  "Narcotics Enforcement
  and the law?’

The agents were raiding an apartment directly above Mrs.
Mehan’s. In the_Mehan apartment Heyward Henry Dyer was
joined by his wife, Linda, seven months pregnant, and their
22-month-old son, Francis. Upstairs Detective Sergeant Frank
Sweeney, a 15-year veteran of the Vernon Police Depart-
ment’s Narcotics Squad, was holding a rifle pointed to the
floor. The rifle was his own treasured weapon, unauthorized
for police business, a high-powered military ordnance AR-15.
Sweeney's gun "somehow" discharged, sending a bullet
through the floor. Heyward Henry Dyer was shot through the
head as he was holding his infant son. "We wereijust talking '
and trying to calm mother down," his wife said, "and all of a
sudden a shot came through the ceiling, and he fell to the

- floor. I looked at him and grabbed my baby. I knew he was , .
dead because his stomach wasn't moving. So I ran outside, -
and I yelled, "You killed him; you killed him!’ And this po-
liceman said tome, ‘LADY, IT WAS JUST AN ACClDENT."’
