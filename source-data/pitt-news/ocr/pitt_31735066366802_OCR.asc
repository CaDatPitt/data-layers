A “good life” for the great ma-
jority\ of mankind has not been
realized, even after 500,000 years
of human existence. Discussing
man’s slow and limited growth
and his future potentialities, Dr.
Mortimer Adler, inventor and ed-
itor of the Syntopicon, spoke
Wednesday at a noon Public Af-
fairs meeting on “The Euture of
Man.”

Concerned with “the total pic-
ture of human life,” Adler out-
lined three signiﬁcant revolutions
in the development of civiliza-
tion and predicted more revolu-
tions to come.

Prior to the Iron Age and the
Age of Fire, man lived a sub-hu-
man and brutal existence. Al-
though he was equipped with the
same mental powers as modern
man, until about 35,000 years ago,
he made few advances towards a
more developed state of life.

’At the. turning point, 35,000
years ago, man entered into a
period of primitive existence. For
the ﬁrst time he ‘ embarked on
domesticating animals, using iron
tools and weapons and arrived at
a skillful use of ﬁre.

“We can only guess,” said Ad-
ler, “why this’ long period of

darkness before even this primi-
tive life evolved.” Earliest man
lived during a period of great
upheaval, the ice ages and chang-
ing geological events. “Perhaps
man had to expend all his ener-
gy just to keep alive.”

Adler marked the era begin-
ning 6,000 years ago as the start
of the next great revolution after

the Iron Age. Civilizations be-

gan to arise and with the growth
of cities came a class society and
slavery. “Civilization is built
upon the institution of slavery,”
said Adler. Since all men did
not have to work for necessities
of life, some could be the think-
ers and the developers of the
arts.

Until the. nineteen hundreds,
civilization developed along these
lines of class societies. A ‘good
life was available for the few at
the expenses of the great major-
ity of mankind. At the beginning
of this century, however, the
third great rev_olution‘ in man’s
history began. .

With the growth of democracy,
industrialization and technolog-
ical growth, came the possibili-
ties of imparting “the-good life”
to/the greatest numbers of peo-

ple. Feeli-ng that classless socie-
ties are a step forward in aiding
the masses, Adler remarked that
the third great revolution is tak-
ing roots today in Communist
China, Russia and Southeast Asia.

Only in the planning stage, a
future fourth great revolution,

will bring with it the political,

physical and economic unity of
the world. In Adler’s estimation,
20th century condition, predict
such a event. .

“Only a Third World War,”
said Adler, “will be a truly world
wide war. Until global war is
possible, world peace is impossi-
ble for peace comes out of war
From world peace will evolve
world government and democra-
cy.” -
Forseeing the possibility that
mankind shall one day reach the
limits of technological, institu-
tional and social improvements,
Adler noted that only then will
man begin to use more of his
intellectual powers. With a world
government, and a peace-on-
earth - good - will - to-men-existense,
“for the ﬁrst time, perhaps, we
will reach the ultimate goal, the
fullest development of the hu-
man intellect.

Bob Supansic’s Tap Day Speech ,
"* Deals With Problem‘ of Individual
‘Against   ‘Human Desert’ Society

(The following is a. copy of the
speech Robert Supansic delivered
at .Wednesday’s Ta-p Day Cere-
monies.)

For the last several‘ decades

5,,-there has been a quiet and angry

.\

struggle going on between the
individual and those forces or-
ganizing his society. This strug-
gle has now ﬂashed bitterly into
the ‘open-—-where our extraordi-
nary native conservatism has led
our “should-know-better” major-
ity to react with panic. Panic,

‘with its unidigniﬁed connotations,
is not too strong a word. We"
need only witness the “good in- .

tentions gone wrong” of the

it ’~ B e rk e l e y administration. With

the individual against the sheer
magnitude of the forces of or-
ganization—-the struggle is an un-
even one. But these forces aligned
with panic/and the match is
painfully—disgracefully unfair.
As civilized individuals —- of
course, we all seek to minimize
the tensions that beset our so-
ciety. In addition to the standard

police-type forces, we have creat-
ed bureaucracies that regulate '

all sorts of human activities to-

ks"/ward the end of marshalling the

M «L

  

forcestof production so that socie-
ty might operate more efficiency.
Our only-—our present’ panicked
attempt: to contain this wild
animal, human society.

We have traveled so far so
fast down this road of social paci-

ﬁcation that we are .the envy of

the rest of the world: what hu-
man problem is so complex that
we can't form a committee to
handle it? This is‘ our attitude,
Our Conveyance. And we have
‘impressed ourselves ‘ sop much
' 'i this "A C A

ance . that we .

are traveling leads into a hu-
man desert.

Man’s single saving grace is not

his rationality but his humanity.
And at base, that humanity re-
duces to a simple matter of in-
tegrity. I use the word in the old,
f0rg0tten way, the way it was
used when men still knew that
they were men, when they still '
knew that underneath all of their
complexity and contradiction
therenwas still possible a unique
lfoherencez and I- add a_profound- 

mysterious coherence. r 

   
  

    
 

 

The few quiet and desperate
voices raised in protest are but
chaff in the wind before the ac-
cumulated age, wisdom, experi-

. ence and numbers of, the bureau-

cracy. That it should be so, is
but further evidence of how val-
ue we place in the ability of an

A individual to see into his own ’

condition.

To see this whole struggle in
microscosm, one need look no
further than this University. Ed-
ucation used to be a process in-
volving the whole man, a test
of character. But the problem of
administering the needs of edu-
cation has turned the University
into a gigantic enterprise whose
primary function seems to be the
production of huge quantities of
used paper. The tour de force of
the university student is the re-
search paper—X pages long, with
such and such bibliography, so
many footnotes, and produced by
a certain date. It seems to me that
the mundane act of Writing a-
paper should be an abt of faith.

But let us look at it from the"

, other direction. I have met one

or two people here who have un-
derstood something of the glories

‘of this language of -ours. I refuse

to forgive this University for not
making a place for its poets. The
result of the University’s unde-
viating indifference is that those
few touched with the lunatic
genius of poetry shield their work
from the world and there is no
one to tell those who think they
have it to shut up. Writing a pa-
per or writing a poem, both, it

seems to me, are tests of a man’s"

integrity, and quite out ofiplace.
When  malils, basic _integrit_y—

tion so that society might oper-
tion of giving him meaningful re-
sponsibilitity. Thus the logic of
reserving an administrative veto
, over any Student Government
legislation. Further, care must be
taken in the recognition of stu-
dent organizations lest chaos
erupt, irrespective of whether
chaotic pluralism is basic to
man"s character. V

In this grand battle,. in this

  Scsviet Literature 

Remains Unchanged

By VICKI EPSTEIN
Basically the situation in
Soviet literature has not
changed in the post-Khru-
shchev era, according to Dr.
George Gibian, presently

chairman of the Department
of Russian.Literature at Cornell
University. Dr. Gibian, a Univer-
sity alumnus, spoke on “The Art
and Themes of Post—Khrushchev
Russian Literature” in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom Monday
night.

Having just returned from Len-

ingrad where he studied Dostoev-
sky and current Soviet literature,
Dr. Gibian said the government
still believes that literature is a
tool for shaping the people and
must be watchedand controlled.
The current writings are drifting
towards greater freedom at a
“very, very slow” rate as they
have done since 1956.
' Prior to 1956; Stalinism had
tightly controlled literature, but
the situation began improving.
Presently, Dr. Gibian believes,
“things have improved but are
still awful.”

The variety of Russian writers
includes the right wing neo-Stal-
inists who think the party should
be strict, the middle of the road-
ers like Mikhail Sholokhov, the
Nobel Prize winner for Litera-
ture, and institutionalized liber-
als who are patriotic to the So-
viet Union but see a great many
things wrong. __

Andre Voznesensky and Yev-
geny Yevtushenko were the most
popular poets ﬁve years ago. Voz-
nesensky?s works are neither po-
litical nor polemical. His ' com-
plex ‘poetry is concerned with
man and the mind and is espe-
cially popular with the technolog-
ical workers because ofhis sci-
entiﬁc images. It is not unusual
for engineers in Russia to be in-
terested in poetry as it is in the
United States Dr. Gibian said‘.

Yevtushenko is popular as a

,“political and public fact,” Dr.

a great open show. This image.
carries over into his writing of
love poems and politically cour-
ageous and liberal poems which
few poets dare to write.

It is .a tradition for poets like
Yevtushenko to be courageous,
liberal, and ﬁght for good causes,
but the prose ‘writers are more
conventional and somewhat dar-
ing in theme. Much of the poetry

remains “underground” and un-
published. Perhaps a few thou-
sand people in each of the major
cities get to read this “under-
ground” literature but in Russia
poets have reputations based on
their unpublished works. In the.
United States published works
start a poet’s reputation.

The current published works
cover a great range of subjects
and are improved in manner to
the Khrushchev era. Although
love scenes, freer verse forms,
and fantasy are permitted, the
pendulum may swing back at any
time and bring complete repres-
sion.

The recent trial of Andrei D.
Sinyavsky and Daniel has sever-

Gibian added. His “loose” life is-

al meanings for Dr. Gibian. Com-
pared with the days of Stalin it
means progress because they
were not shot, tortured nor did
they just disappear. It is a step
back if compared with -the tsarist
days andvthe last few years.

Some people will be encour-
aged by the defendants not plead-
ing guilty and defending them-
selves which is not usual in Rus-
sia. The two writers pleaded that
.a. story is a work of literature
and not the author’s personal
views.

-Other people will feel “terror.”
But, in general, the development
of this trial unpredictable. Dr.
Gibian said, “I wouldn’t expect
any radical development either

way.”

Law Professor
Warns About

Law Service

Students have been advised
not to use the Law School Place-
ment Service (LSPS). This infor-
mation comes after an investiga-
tion ‘into the LSPS by Frances
E. Holahan, professor of law
and chairman of the Law School
Admission Committee. '

Several months ago the foun-
ders of the LSPS, two law stu-
dents at the University of Con-

necticut, sent out a release stat- '

ing._ the aims of the new place-
ment service. By feeding vital
facts to computers, the place-
ment service intended to help
students’ ﬁnd law schools that
would meet their particular bud-
get, grades, and law boards.

The investigation by Professor
Holahan found that the service
was not endorsed by the Ameri-
can Association of Law Schools
nor ’ the American Bar Associa-
tion. - .

Instead of using_the LSPS the
professsor advise the perspective
law student turn to the- Univer-
sity’s School of Law for infor-
mation concerning the student’s
chances for admittance to it’s
law school or any other law
school. '

terrupted. But is this suffici-
ent reason considering the
end result of this system.
 That ‘end result has been
to‘ create an army of the poor
and uneducated and an ex-
empt status for the collegi-
ate wealthy. Naturally not
all the wealthy have 2-S sta-
tus and not all.men from
low income groups are out

ently, I began to think
about their future. For a
while I thought one friend
might be in trouble because
he}-lives in a swank east side
-apartment in New York City.
‘Nearly all the young men
living in the silk stocking
district might have some
form of student exemptions
and they’re going to have to
take someone from his local

the Puerto Rican slum boys
are safely nearby.

I The

can Revolution, he realizes
his local board will take all
the “nice nigra boys” before
they’ll take him.

Now General Hershey is
going to raise the cut off
point for his elite of the ex-
empt. It seems certain that
grades of students will be
reviewed and those in the
lower percentage of ‘ their
classes will be drafted. More-
over, the General has insti-
tuted a test to be given this
May.’ Male college students
will have to make a certain
mark to keep their precious
2-S.

THIS TOO has rather dis-
turbing possibilities. Her-
shey says it will sift out the
slackers. But in many cases
it will protect the more in-
telligent. Secondly, it may
penalize those with less abil-
ity who may be. hard work-
ers but justcan make a cer-
tain average.

The Selective Service Sys-
tem will apparently not take
into account the difficulty of
courses at a student’s insti-
tution or the ability of the
particular student when they
review his grades. Without
these considerations included
in the decision, it ' will be
practically impossible to
search out the less dedicated
students.

Few problems have ever
left with a more schizophren-

ic mind set. One part of me
is disgusted by the whole’

situation. Should not the war
effort and its. professed dem-
ocratic purpose be the over-
riding consideration? It

would seem more logical con-
sidering present government
pronouncements on the war
situation that U. S. leaders
would ask themselves, “How
can these men keep the world
safe from Communism?” not
“How' can we possibly inter-
rupt the college studies of
these men?” '

YET ANOTHER,part of
me, perhaps less dedicated
to liberalism, idealism and
momentarily more in sym-
pathy with Edmund Burke,
relaxes in the midst of the
system. A junior in the up-
per two thirds of my class,
I simply have nothing to
worry about for the next
year or so. There are many
to take before they’ll come
to me. _

Still while I relax I cannot
forget that someone is ﬁght-
ing my war for me. Asll.
choose between a beer blast,
the Ugly Man Dance orthe
Opera for Saturday night en-

tertainment, I realize some-

one my age and a citizen of
my country has less attrac— ’
tive duties ahead‘ of. him the
same night. And as I comb
my hair before I leave for
my date, I’m conscious of my
untouched forehead and
think how many of my peers
have their’s , covered with
dirty, bloody bandages.

In the end I am too close
to the situation to either con-
demn or condone. That will
be for others to decide. But,
I know there is an elite in
this country. We must neV.: _

caused more commotion than a fox in-a chicken coop. Feel-
ings of fear and anxiety, in this case the effect of the pres-
ence of one mouse among 60 girls, are widespread on this
campus today for other reasons. Students are concerned
about -the University becoming a state-related school and '

The University

Mouse
’ by ’Nancy Fuchs

A tiny black mouse on a girls’ dormitory floor has

the proposed elimination of the trimester system.

AT FIRST, a,__ comparison between an insignificant
I mouse and the significant issue of state-relatedness may_
appear ludicrous. But students are responding in a similar
manner to these comparable situations. A good part of the
fear associated with the presence of a mouse is its speed.
When it runs around the bottom of a girl’s closet or streaks
past her in the hall, it startles her. Because it is too fast,
efforts to catch it under a box_or was-tebasket prove futile.
In the same way, students have been
stunned by the speed with which circumstances at the Uni-
versity have changed within the last year. Dr. Litchﬁeld’s
resignation, Dr. Crawfoi'd’s death, Dr. Kurtzman’s chancel-
lorship, the probability of state-relatedness, and the.elimin—'
ation of the trimester plan have catapulted the student into
a state of anxiety. It is like having your chair pulled out
from under you, not once, but many times. A -
While seniors may shrug their shoulders and thank *

their lucky stars that they are graduating, underclassmen
fear that changes may have a great impact on their future.
They ask questions of each other. Will the University re-
vert to its former status as a “streetcar” college? Will its
academic standards drop? Will the influx of greater num-
bers of students make classes even larger? What will hap-
pen to scholarships when tuition is lowered? How can we
complete college in two and two-thirds years if the tri-
mester system is dropped? Some students become so ob-
sessed with their fears that they rashly proclaim that the
University is going downhill, that state-relatedness means
state-control and will destroy the ﬁne achievements of the
last ten years. These fears are as irrational as those asso- --
ciated with the mouse, but since students are the last to
learn about major-» changes in the Universitylland since».
rumors run rampant in times of transition, it is easy to see

It is too elusive.

how this feeling develops.

BESIDE!S DISTORTIONS‘ of the entire situation, there
is also a tendency to overlook thegood points in proposals
for change. In addition to the reduction of tuition, another
beneﬁt to the undergraduate would be the subsidy of under-
graduate and graduate education permitting top notch pro-



-I.
#-

fessors in the graduate schools to teach undergraduates. ﬁn‘.

Thus one of the advantages of attending’ a University with
a good graduate school, having graduate professors for un-
dergraduate courses, would be more pronounced than it is I
‘I now. Also, a calendar change would permit University stu-
dentsgto take courses not offered here, at other schools, a
' decided advantage for the student.

As it was impossible to catch the mouse with the waste-
basket, it is impossible for students to comprehend all of
the factors involved in making a decision regarding state-
relatedness and making provisions for such a proposal. They 
do not have the proper tools of knowledge to work with. 
However, students should be heartened by thefast. that the '

V University Faculty Senate approved the bill 200 to one. The-
administration and faculty seem to feel that state-related-
ness. is the'best thing for the University. We have read
administrative opinions in The Pitt News and heard pro-
fessors’ opinions in classes. Soon,perhaps, if Student Gov-
ernment is able to carry out its idea we will have a forum
with administration, members of the Board of Trustees,‘
H and state officials explaining the proposed setup. I

BUT STUDENTS have views, too, and they want to be

llealﬁl. It seems a little late to take a poll ofstudent opinion.
on ie questions of state relatedness and the trimester.

However, if StudentGovernment does- take a good poll, the

results of which can be considered valid it will at least/show '

that the students are concerned and feel that they have a

strong: the symbol, the legend,‘
the innovator, the 66-year-old kid.
He has spanned the creation of
jazz itself, has taken his Dixie-
land music around the world, and
tonight—before a one-nighter in
Pittsburgh——-tonight, Louis Arm-
strong is practicing.

Two warning bells fail to rouse
the ﬁve musicians, but a tense
agent gets everybody out of the
dressing room and ‘onstage. Then
Satchmo joins his group, and be-.
gins to charm the audience with
his horn, his gravel-voiced“scat
singing” (“. bop-zoo-zop-do-
zow good evenin’ every-
body!”), and his familiar stand-
bys (“Oh when the saints . . . go
mah chin’ din". . .”).

The songs are old and familiar,
but they cannot be reeled off as
they once were on the S.S. .St.
Paul, which‘~-carried Louis and
“Fate. Marable’s Jazz-E-Sazz
Band” up and down the Missis-
sippi between New Orlea-ns and
St. Louis. The recent hit records
like Mack the Knife and Hello,
Dolly! give way to solos by the
younger, non-Dixieland musicians
as Louis “keeps it rollin”’ by
calling on Catlett, Bailey, Napo-
leon, and G1een—who is intro-

I“ duced as “Teensie Weesie.”

Resting pensively on a folding
chair behind the band, Louis lis-
.tens to his group play Volare,
Teach Me Tonight, and — appro-
priately enough —- There’ll Be
Some Changes Made. He stands
up only to play the ﬁnal chords
to these songs, or to do one of
his famous numbers for the au-

For the audience the evening
ends -. quickly, but for Louis Arm-

strong the night wears on. In theﬂl

large dressing room the other

the one they want to see is in a
small dressing room in the hall-
way. Friends come in and shake
hands with Satchmo, kids peek
in and take’ ﬂash snapshots, and
all the while Louis laughs and
smiles as if this concert in Pitts-
burgh had been his ﬁrst musical
triumph. _

The scene is an improbable
one: the people, the gravelly
laughter, the classical music com-
ing from Louis’ small transistor
radio, the friends advising the
66-year-old kid “Get some sleep
Louis, really”; the mouthpiece-
scarred lips smeared with Vase-
line, saying “Hiya, Pops . ._ . stay

autograph. To alien eyes these

Trivial Contest

Highlights Questions
On Comics, History

By ANDREA B. REITER

The boxes in the Towers
Lobby and in front of the
Student Union Desk were
stuffed ‘with enough trivia
to supply any professor with

exam questions for the next‘

20 years. The Special Interests
Committee, however, snatched
their potential test material for
Thursday night's Trivia Contest.

In College Bowl fashion, two
teams answefed questions thrown
by moderator Robert Supansic.
Three games were played with
different teams on each so that
as many volunteers as possible
were given a chance to partici-
pate.

Questions ranged from the
name of F. Scott Fitzerald’s ﬁrst
wife to the name of the city in
the United States where Levis
are made.

Many of the questions were.
drawn from the entertainment
world. “Of what ﬁve animals was
Flubbadub composed?”, and
“What does Captain Marvel’s
‘Shizam’ stand for?” were asked.
(In case you don't know, it's
Samson, Hercules, Zeus, Atlas,
and Mercury).

Other questions included the-

name of ‘the typhoon that wreck-
ed Kubla Kahn’s Empire, the
-name of the ﬁrst “Playmate of
the Month,” and the name of the
person who made George‘ Wash-
ington’s dentures.

No catch question was -barredsi.

For example, “How many grooves
are on a 12” LP album that spins
at 331/fa rpm’s?” was asked (two
—now ﬁgure that one out!).

The nicer comments of the
players during the contestwere
“Oh, what triva” and “Are you
kidding?”

The winning question was sub-
mitted by four members of the
Graduate Student's Organization.
For asking the average distance
that all the zippers in the United
States travel each day (l50,000
miles), Dave Wright, Rich Mack-
ey, Ron Small, and Al Black
were awarded a hamburger from
Oakland Original and a roll of
toilet paper with jokes printed
on it.

A Batmanigame was awarded
to Carol Feingold. As Best Play-
er she knew the colors in which
M & M's are made and the ﬁve
ﬂavors of Gains Bits Dog Food.

The end of the contest, how-
ever, became a little too trivial.
The slated refreshments weren’t
served.

QUAX ADDITION

‘Elsa Acosta and Patricia Car- ’ '

nall, chemistry majors, were
tapped to Quax (women's sci-
ence honorary) this week. Their
names were not included in
the tapping list in Wednesday's
Pitt News.

“This year’s tournament’s
stronger than last years,” said
Pitt Coach Warren Neiger. “Mark
Cohn from Temple didn't com-
pete last year and he was a win-
ner in the Maccabiad games in
Israel. He took the all-around
trophy. There are also more rep-
resentatives from each school.”

One trouble that takes away
from the excitement of the East-

a team title. “I think this cuts

taking two years of Army ROTC training while you; complete your studies for a college
degree. You can qualify for this program by attending a special six-week summer training
camp after your sophomore year" and then completing the ROTC Advanced Course in
your junior and senior years of college. '"

Here’s what ROTC training and an officer"s commission will do for you:
0 it will qualify you to fulfill your military obligation as an officer.
0 You will learn to organize, motivate, and lead others.

0 You will develop leadership qualities that many college men miss—self-discipline,
physical stamina, poise, bearing, the acceptance of responsibility and other qualities
that contribute to success in either a civilian or military career.

0 You will receive $40 per month during your junior and senioriyears, plus pay and mile-
age for summer training.

The training and experience you will receive through Army ROTC will pay off for the
rest of your life. A decision to take advantage

of this new program could be one of the
most important you will ever make. '

You owe it to yourself to investigate this new important opportunity.

There are several top men to

Steve Cohen is a good shot for

 ave McKinnisGy

By MAX PEPPER
i Four yearsago, Dave Mc-
.~Kinnis came here from a
ssutler High gym team that
‘had never lost a meet. On
the locker room wall of the

"Northern, Pa. high school a
sign was posted that read “Win-
ning _is_‘ not the most important
thing in the world; it’s the only
thillg.”
' Since McKinnis has been com-
peting, the gymnasts haven’t had
"a winning season. The best rec-
ord that the gymnasts have pull-
_ed in the last four years has been
a 5-5. season that they posted
last year.

j_This year the Panther gymnasts
mark was 4-7. While the rest of
the team was losing, McKinnis
was a consistent winner. In the
11 dual meets that McKinnis per-
formed in, he took 18 ﬁrsts. Most
of these ﬁrsts were won in the
ﬂoor exercise event and the still
rings.
~ When asked if he cared about
being a winner on a losing team
"in a..sport that half the people
going to this school don’t know
_exists, McKinnis said, “I wouldn't
trade my experiences at Pitt for
anything. Coach Neiger is really
a, great guy and has helped me

tremendously. 7

“Even though winning has been
important to me, since high
school, if I had to do it all over
again, I’d still come here.”

McKinnis will be performing
in his last meet this weekend
as the Eastern Intercollegiate
Championships come to Pitt. The
class of, competition that McKin-
nis will face is one of the best
in the country. With a little luck,
lVlcKinnis should_be able to place
in the three events., the side
horse, still rings, and ﬂoor exer-
cise.

mnastso

“I don't think my chances oi‘
winning are the greatest.” said
McKinnis. “When I think of all
the gymnasts who beat me dur-
ing the season and that PI! be
competing. against, it makes me
nervous. I’m going into ‘the meet
with my ﬁngers crossed.”

McKinnis’ scores have consis-
tently been between 8.75 and 9.2.
If McKinnis is to win, he will
have to raise his scores to an
average of 9.5 or better. Steve
Cohen of Penn State and Mark
Cohn of Temple have been aver-
aging between 9.2 and 9.5 in

these events.

McKinnis, captain of this year’:-
gym team, was the team“; all-
around man during the 11 dual
meets this season. In the East-
erns, McKinnis won’t be compet-
ing innthe all-around, rather than
waste his energy performing in
events that he can’t possibly win,
such as parallel bars and the
horizontal bar.

Besides being an all-around gym-
nast, McKinnis is an all-around
student. Majoring in physical ed-
ucation, McKinnis has a QPA of
3.03. Last Tuesday, McKinnis was

Mitters Practice
Indoors at Trees

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis has
his squad practicing indoors at
Trees Gymnasium prior to the
opening of outdoor drills and the

‘regular season. Of the 45 boys
trying out. for the team, Lewis
must keep 25. _

“Right now we are just letting
our pitchers loosen their arms
and we are going through diiTer-
ent drills, pepper ball and the
like,” Lewis said.

“Because of so many activities
scheduled for the Field House,
the boys won’t be able to use the
batting cage as yet, but I will
probably start cutting some fel-
lows by that time,” Lewis con-
tinued. '

Last year, Lewis’ team record

was 17-4.

By GEORGE LIES
Seasons grow longer and
longer. The swimming team
ends such a season tomor-
row against the Air Force
Academy at Trees Pool at
2:00 p.m.

Long ago in the Fall months
of the year, the swimmers be-
gan lengthy drills for an even
longer road ahead. Their‘ ﬁrst
meet was against Michigan State

(losing 90-33) in the ﬁrst week

of the Christmas month. Tomor-
row they‘end a rather poor sea-
son, winning the meetwill give
them four victories; losing it will
give them eight losses.

For some. of the individual per-
formers, there will be still more
road to cover. The Eastern Col-
legiatesiare set for next Saturday
at Navy, and the National Col-
legiates are set for March 26 at
the Air Force. And if any of the.
swimmers choose to do so, they
can enter,in one of many sched-
uled AAU tournaments.

Before a swimmer can go to
the Easterns, he must have the
approval and the ﬁnancial back-
ing of the Athletic Department.
“Although I would like to see a
few of the deserving boys make
it to the Easterns, the athletic
chairman has not said anything
to me about it,” coach Ben Grady

said. “Next Monday, however, I
should know for certain.”
Putting all thought of future
dates out of his mind, Grady
said, “right now our problem

lies with the Air Force meet.”

JOE LEVIERE
“Always godd QM‘ five points.”

 

The biggest attraction of to-
morrow’s competition should be-
the high board diving event. The
mermen’s co-captain Don Hahn-
feldt goes for his seventh win of
the year. Qpposing him is an-
other ﬁneidiver, Dan McLean.

“At Ohio University, Hahnfeldt
freshened-up on a few higher-
degree - of - diqiculty dives so he
wouldn’t be rattled when he had
to perform before a large audi-
ence like in the Easterns,” Grady
-said. .

In the Ohio meet, Hahnfeldt
replaced his usual back 21/2 and
his reverse 21/2 with the back 11/2
layout and the 11/2 layout. The
fraction represents the number
of required somersaults.

Sophomore John Lane, who
seems to be carrying a large part
of the swimming tea-m’s load,
may ﬁnd a little trouble with the
swim in the 200 and the 500-yard
Falcon’5 Rick Abramson. Both

freestyle events.

eason;   H

men’s lineup, the butterﬂy, the
Air Force shows two seniors, Ron
Grabbe and _V Warren Leek. Dick
Hulme usually swims in that
event but Grady can alternate
with Gary Martin.

Joe LeViere, who Grady counts
on for ﬁve points in every meet,
swims in his backstroke specialty.
He will be out to_ establish his
best time against the Air Force
so he has substantial proof for
why he should go to the Easterns.
