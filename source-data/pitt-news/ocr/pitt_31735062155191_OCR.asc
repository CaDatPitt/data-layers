Academic Integrity Policy Urged

 SUB Forum Program
To Consider Merits,
Faults of LA Advising

A Student Union Board Forum will debate the merits
and faults of the Liberal Arts advising Center December 4
from 3 to 5 p.m. in the Student Union. Both underclass and
major advising will be considered. -

Members of the panel include James Watson, director
of the advising center; Nancy Delaney, senior math major,
and a male student to be announced.

They will point out the good and bad aspects of the

_. pre.-sent system and suggest ways to make the advising

more effective.
Questions to be discussed are
as follows: ‘

——Has the faculty failed to un-
derstand the concept of a liberal
arts education?

—Is the disintegration of class
structure under the trimester
system a problem?

'—Are 16 full time advisors

 and a director able to advise
- 2,154 full-time students, since
1; each of the 16 has 150 advisees
-‘ and the director, 58 ?

::D.o ..dis.tribt.1.tion...courses offer

—Is the caliber of students ad-

—Does the impersonality of

dents in place of professors in
the students’ major ﬁelds?

Those dormitory ~women who
voted overwhelmingly approved
the proposals of off-campus hous-
ing for women over 21 and elim-
ination of curfews for senior
women over 21 in an opinion poll
Thursday. Of the 1,000 plus,wom-
en dormitory students, 280 voted.

s “It is not going to be in our
favor that so few voted,” explain-
ed Housing Board Chairman Dor-
rie Brand, alluding to the fact
that the ﬁnal decision on the pro-
posals rests with the administra-
tion. She had 600 ballots printed
and expected that she would
need even more.

The vote on the ﬁrst proposal
providing that women students
21 years of age or over before
the ﬁrst day of a trimester may
live off campus was as follows:
53 to six freshmen; 148 to two
sophomores and juniors; and 69 to
0 seniors. On the second proposal
permitting women students with
90 or more credits to be exempt-
ed from curfews if over 21, and
with parental permission if un-
der 2l, 49 freshmen to ten ap-
proved; 126 to 22 sophomores
and juniors, and 60 to ten seniors.

 proposals that senior women live oi! campus and that those women

Student Government has urged the Uni-
versity to take deﬁnite action on deviations
by the student body from its standards of
academic integrity.

In a motion passed unanimously at a
meeting last Thursday, SG recognized that

“cheating, plagarism and other dishonest
techniques for .achieving ‘a high grade’ exist within
our University community."

They recommend that the University “recognize.

its obligation both to itself and the student com-
munity and to exercise its right by taking deﬁnite
action in the form of counsel, probation and dis-
missal.”

SG President John Vrana labeled the resolution
“a ﬁne statement. We should recognize the prob-
lem we have,” Vrana said. “We have a responsi-
bility as well .as a right to pass it.”

When asked after the meeting what he felt the
student body reaction would be to the resolution on
academic "integrity, Vrana said that he felt the stu-
dent body “would welcome our comment that we
urge the University to act when deviations exists.”
He explained that many students had come to him
asking that SG do something about this problem.

All members of SC} expressed their complete
support of the resolution, Chairman of SG’s Able
Party, Martin Engels, said: -“The party gives the
statement on academic integrity its full endorse-
ment. It is truly a signiﬁcant step in the improve-
ment of the status and quality of our institution.”

Senator Jack Koury admitted that he had op-
posed a statement on academic integrity in the
past because he felt an effective one could not be
written, but he supported this statement completely.
Koury said the resolution “recognizes that the evil
exists and suggests a form of action.”

The bill which was introduced by Senator Kay
Shenesky will be placed in the official records of

‘the Student Government and copies of the state-
ment will be sent to the Chancellor of the Univer-
sity, the Vice Chancellors in the academic areas, the
Dean of Women and the Dean of Men, and the Chair-
man of the Faculty Senate.

Besides stating that cheating does exist at the
University and that the University should take def-
inite action, the resolution deﬁned academic in-

standards.

tegrity as being “in a broad sense the attitude with
which a student pursues his education.” It said that
“high ideals concerning the pursuit of knowledge
and understanding  . are construed by some to
mean only the personal attainment of a high grade
average. The intense competition present in all as-
pects of academic life also fosters this over-concem
with grades.”

The statement further explained that “the ad-
vantages for the maintenance of academic integrity

are based" on a moral foundation and would seem

to be self evident: The individual beneﬁts by the
developments of a strong character value; the~,Uni-
versity by -having a single standard for the evalua-
tion of students’ achievements.”

At the same meeting SG unanimously passed a
resolution naming Sherry Merenstein as chairman
of Winter Weekend. President Vrana asked for the
passage of the resolution, explaining that all the
student leaders who had interviewed candidates

for the position felt Miss Merenstein was the best ’

qualiﬁed.

Prof. Lee to Publish

‘An American as Faust’

A dramatic poem in three acts An American as Faust
by Lawrence Lee, professor of English, is being published
by Boxwood Press and will go on sale at the University Book
Center in January. The paperback edition will cost $1.50 and

the bound edition, $2.50.

“According to Professor Lee, the poem is the story of
the modern American and his alienation from his own best
values.” An Amedican as Faust deals with a central feminine figure

named Margaret who represents the modern young woman seeking to
fulfill her life in the presence of men with an inadequate under-

standing of life and the nature of womanhood,

Detlef Kraus, noted concert

pianist and professor of Pi-

ano at Folkbang Academy of

Essen Germany, visited cam-

pus Thursday to give a. PM

Series Concert.

Music, like History, re-
curs in periods of Classic
and Romance. Thus while
one may like Brahms over
Bach, one cannot play Bach
as if he were Brahms. Mu-
sic must be considered in
context; to do otherwise is to
prevent the composer's intentions.

 If Detlef Kraus had one fault

(and they were difficult to ﬁnd)
at the PM Series Thursday night,

 it was this. Otherwise, his per-

formance was perfect.

Mr. Kraus was a Romantic in
the full sense of the word. His
technique was ﬂawless. The piano
resounded when he played a cre-

‘ scendo, yet assumed the delicacy

of a violin on the softer passages.
It was his lightness of touch
that was particularly impressive.
Consequently, because of these
qualities, Mr. Kraus triumphed
when he played the Romantics,
which composed the majority of
his program. Only Scarlatti, who
requires a different technique, suf-
fered. Scarlatti requires a Classi-
cist’s approach; the music must
ﬂow, yet be able to stand on its
own at any moment for an exam-
ination of form. Kraus could not
truly do justice to Scarlatti.
When we get to Beethoven,
however, it is quite a diﬁerent
matter. Beethoven is considered
the transition between these two
periods in music. Either approach
is suitable, and it is merely a
matter of taste which is more

is a peculiar quality to Waltzes,
which requires that they be play-
ed with a certain amount of re-
straint. Whether the effect of this
restr.aint is due to the quality of
a waltz, or Kraus, or both, the
performance was simply beauti-
ful. That light-handed technique
which Kraus used . so often in
other pieces, was in perfect or-
der here, yet the music simply
took off when called for, making
the total effect an intelligible
whole.

The program closed with the
Third Sonata of Prokoﬁeif. This
piece had a relentless drive to it
which was perfect for Kraus. He

the audience fully appreciated

the result was satisfying.

However, where Kraus really

up to the test here, -rising and

20 Years in Military
By SANDY FOX

Ridgeway Clark, II, is one University undergraduate
who does not have to worry about being drafted. A junior in
secondary education, he already has served 20 years a mem-
ber of the United States Army.

Clark attended the. University of Delaware in 1941-42
before entering the Army during World War II. During his

tenure of service, he spent a great deal of time in the Far
East and in Europe. He also

served in the Korean War.

In 1962, Clark retired as a
lieutenant colonel and entered
the University. Clark chose edu-
cation as his second career be-
cause he “likes teaching and likes
children." His Army career serves
as a backg-ound for his ﬁeld of
social studies and geography.

Clark lives in Irwin with his
wife and two children, ages nine
and six. The children, he said,
learn from him just as he learns
from them. For instance, when-
ever the family buys something
from another country, such as a
transistor radio made in Taiwan,

the children learn to locate the
country in which the product
was lhade on a large world globe
in his study.

From his daughters’ grade
school experiences, Clark is leam-
ing about the newest systems of ,
teaching. .

While serving in a foreign
country, he said he tried to “con-
form to the customs of the coun-
try in order to learn about the
people and to understand their
culture.”

Because of his varied experi-
ences throughout the world, his
viewpoint often diverges from
that of his fellow classmates.
“But,” he comments, “essentially
we agree on objectives."

Clark noted that today’s stu-
-dents, compared with students of
20 years ago, are a “bit more
mature and seem to have a better
idea of what they want.” He add-
ed that he has “thoroughly en-
joyed his courses” at the Uni-
versity even though the courses
seem “more complex" than those
he took at Delaware.

He expressed his attitude to-
ward his delayed college educa-

I like all audiences. It is hard

Universities Urge End
To Discrimination

The current issue of Rights magazine, published by the
B’nai B’rith Anti—Defamation League, reports that fewer
than 20 per cent of American colleges and universities with
social fraternities on campus have “urged or required’’ elnn-
ination of discriminatory fraternity practices. _ .

The publication summarizes a study of umversity pohcy

on fraternity discrimination
sion on Human Rights in Higher
Education, with the co-operation
of the Anti-Dafamation League.

Official college action is need-
ed, the study said, if educational
institutions are “to support so-
ciety’s efforts to end discrimina-
tion based on race, relation and
national origin.”

Elimination of restrictive claus-
es by fraternities from their own
by-laws notes the study, has had
little effect on membership prac-
tices.

It points out that although
there remain only two out of 61
national fraternities that retain
restrictive clauses in their con-
stitutions, this has failed to “pro-
duce signiﬁcant racial and reli-
gious integration” in their mem-
bership. '

Parker Enwright, advisor to
fraternities at the University,
said that no University fraternity
has restrictive clauses. Enwright
said that January of 1965 is the
deadline for University fraterni-
ties to issue official policy state-
ments against discrimination. If
a statement is not received by
that date, he said, “we will not

  Silent Encouragement
The students have officially asked the University administration to
"recognize its obligation to make a strong stand on academic integrity. And
“despite the homily that integrity must lie with the individual, we agree
.¥ with the Student Government proposal that the initiative must come from
the institution itself.

Cheating certainly does go on here, as it does in practically every
-other facet of our society, but not actively discouraging it in the class-
room silently encourages the majority of the cases of dishonesty;

-~ There is always the expedient individual who will take advantage of
any situation. But the main problem is with those who see others getting
away with it, those who think the professor doesn't care and that it may
be the only way of getting through the course.

It is this margin at the University, who are ﬁnding it not only so-
cially acceptable but often academically necessary to cheat, who must be
dissuaded by a strong University stand.-—as evidenced by high values of
integrity in the classroom and a consistant standard of punishment for
‘infractions.

We hope that any disagreement the faculty may be having over the
system of punishment in their own proposal does not hinder an immediate
move for a healthy attitude in this area.

When only 75 women out of 1,000 dorm students show up at a panel
discussion on their own housing regulations and when only 280 of that

number show up to vote, the administration may well wonder where the

enthusiasm is for supposedly so vital an issue.

Part of the reason for the small number of voter turn-out must be
attributed to the day and the place. Many students have no classes on
Thursday and a special trip to the 12th ﬂoor of the Cathedral on a rainy
afternoon probably seemed too much to all but the most enthusiastic.
There was sufficient publicity, according to the chairman of Housing
Board, but perhaps a more convenient voting place in t-he dormitory lob-
bies Would have lured more participants. ‘

More signiﬁcant perhaps was a factor which ties in with a challenge
tossed out at the panel discussion Wednesday night——Are you afraid of

V responsibility because you’re afraid of yourselves? Perhaps these women

felt comfortable with the status quo, desiring a ready-made security and
protection for as long as they can have it. Perhaps others were interested
but were afraid to commit themselves and content to let others ﬁght or
lose the battle for them.

A few possibilities—and for those women who did not show up, a
sorry display—that they did not let themselves be challenged.

'P0BA’l‘ oping countries
need a symbol of image to rely upon. In
many countries, like Indonesia, Egypt,
Ghana and others, the symbol is created
in a dictatorial type of leader. During the

 

» . ﬁrst years of Independence, Ngo Dinh

Diem was a symbol for the people.

Yet the lack of support of a strong
party, and corruption inside his family,
caused his fall last year. His fall left the
country without any real leader, who, ac-
cepted by the people, could lead the nation
in her ﬁght against communism.

The large amounts of money given to
the country through American aid, found

- their way mainly into the urban and mili-

tary sectors. The large agrarian population
did not beneﬁt enough from this money
ﬂow. This enlarged the gap in the standard
of living between the rural and urban sec-
tors, causing further tensions which were
ofiien developed along religious and tribun-
a ines.

exist, were the‘ ﬁrst to be attacked and

In regard to military aid, the Ameri-

“ cans helped to form and train a large army.

This army was trained to defend the coun-

North that never came. Even now, ﬁve

of the army has not adjusted to the con-

This is a war of “hit and run,’ a war
where you don’t see your enemy, a war

where the tank and the jet are of limited
use, andthe combat unit needed is a small
commando group and not an army division.

The Viet Cong took advantages of all
these errors. Using persuasion, rumors,
pamphlets, threats, sabotage, murder and
military actions, they successfully fought
the government. Impeding government
projects, they encouraged non-cooperation
with the bureaucracy, gaining active or at
least passive support from the peasantry.

ALTHOUGH PROSPECTS are dim, the
Viet Nam situation might still bebrought
under control in order to win, American
forces need to be heard and seen less.
They should provide the materials and
technical means for winning the war (as
the Chinese do for the Viet Cong) but
leave the ﬁghting to the Vietnamese
themselves. I

The strategy must be changed from de-
fense to attack. Units need to be taught
how to live and ﬁght in the jungle for long
periods of time. These units should be sent
out to attack. the enemy at his own bases,
in South Viet Nam as well as in the North,
cutting his supply lines, and spreading de-
moralizing propaganda. The training doc-
trine must be one of fighting the Commun-
ist, but helping the peasants by means of
medical care in emergency, food supply,
etc. The Americans should stand by ready
to interfere only in case of an open inva-
sion from the North.

We must realize that even if success-
ful. on the military front, the Communists
defeat is not sure in the long run.

POLICIES MUST BE developed on two
levels. On the national level, there is a need

. for a strong leader, who will be a symbol

for the population. Such a leader must give
the image of leading the Vietnamese to-
ward unity and independence from a Chi-
nese takeover.

On the local level there is a need for
development and improvement in the stan-
dard of living among the peasants. The
work should be carried out by a Vietna-
mese expert who will be given enough pro-
tection against personal attacks.

Training those people, inside as well as
outside the country, should combine mod-
ern know-how with their knowledge of lo-
cal traditions and needs, and encourage
the drive for success. American experts
are welcome only if they are of the “work-
ing type” and not merely the “advising

Last is the need for building a wide
network of information and propaganda.
It should work in both directions. On the
one hand, it will provide the people with
information and patriotic anti-communist
ideology. On the other hand, it will provide
the central authorities with information,
enabling them to develop further strate-

gies and policies. Without such a feedback _

See You at Intermission...

by Wayne Cloeren

By WAYNE CLAEREN
Walt Disney has had so

F many huge successes that

hearing about another Dis-
ney hit is like hearing that
the Yankees Won another
pennant. Sometimes one man
can make such a giant con-
tribution to the entertaimnent
ﬁeld that his popularity is taken
for granted and he even becomes
unpopular with
many people.
Nevertheless,
Dis n e y h as
“done it again”
and Mary Pop-
pins will be one
of the biggest in
.a long list of
' big hits. This is
Claeren a ﬁlm which
can be enjoyed on many levels,
but to do so, the viewer must
drop the barriers which might be
in his mind regarding the Dis-
ney success formula and the idea
of children’s theater.

    

If you can let yourself slip
back into the world of imagina-
tion and fun (which children do
so easily and which adults are
only prevented from doing by
their own mental blocks) you can
enjoy Mary Poppins as you might
have enjoyed it on your seventh
birthday.

Just enjoying the surprises and
accepting the fantasy are the key
steps in beginning to appreciate
this grand adventure.

Some folks are able to keep a
ﬂare for the thrills of childhood
while maintaining more intellec-
tual interests as well. Indeed, it
is true that the two can comple-
ment each other quite well—if we
but let them.

Thoseiwho remember the Mary
Poppins’ stories by English au-

thoress P. L. Travers will ﬁnd
that the screen version has been
careful to recreate characters
true to the memories of adults
and children (who are sharp crit-
ics about how ﬁlms treat favorite
literary friends). Disney co-oper-
ated closely with Mrs. Travers,
who for many years refused to
give up the ﬁlm rights for this
very reason. The ﬁnal result was
applauded by Mary Poppins’ crea-
tor and will be applauded by her
fans as well.

The movie is a ﬁne musical
comedy. The choreography is ex-
citing; the songs are fun; the
technique, expert. The story is
based on a very typical and very
British family in the Victorian
Era. Their characters and situa-
tions are so real that the fan-
tasy brought by the arrival of
Mary Popllills is the more be-
lievable and the more enjoyable.

This is where the magniﬁcent
Disney talents shine. The ability
to make the characters so real
yet so ideal, and the story so ex-
citing yet so possible is what
draws us into it and gives us
the thrill of participating as well
as viewing.

The cast was carefully chosen,
and with wonderful result. Julie
Andrews, surely one of the mu-
sical theater’s greatest talents, is
the center of all the delight, and
this is as it should be. Dick Van
Dyke’s many skills make him a
most capable partner for Miss
Andrews, despite his trouble
with a cockney accent.

Some very excellent actors ﬁll
the secondary roles with a depth
that Disney seldom achieves. Da-
vid Thomlinson, Glynis Johns,

‘ Reginald Owen, Arthur Treacher

and Elsa Lanchester are all
known for serious dramatic

achievement. Ed Wynn is pre-
sent, too—happy as ever after
61 years in the business. Disney
always comes up with good child
actors; Karen Dotrice and Mat-
thew Garber are likeable with-
out being sticky sweet.

An animated sequence is per-
haps the high point of the ﬁlm.
After all, this is where Walt start-
ed out. This time the live char-
acters .are worked in with the
cartoon characters with clever
results. Dick Van Dyke’s dance
with the penquins is great, and
the fox" from the foxhunt scene
has already become famous.

Mary Poppins may well become
a classic ﬁlm. It surpasses many
of Disney's own successes in its
appeal and its style. Don’t stay
away because you think it’s just
for kids. 'I'here is a lot of fun
here, even for the most sedate
and serious. Chances are you'll
ﬁnd your childhood is really not
as far off as you thought.

With It '

By Marvin Zelkovvitz

SHELL OUT, STUDENTS
Copyrighted Story
EVERY TIME THIS school has budgetary problems, stu-
dents’ parents have budgetary problems. In the last few
years, when the University needed more money, it
raised tuition. Tuition rates here rank favorably with
any major school in the country. —
Some students question that they are getting the
’ quality. of education they deserve for their investment.
The last tuition raise here aroused a wave of sentiment
against the University. Many students and some par-
ents said at that time that they would not tolerate an-
other raise in tuition. Others said that they simply
‘could not tolerate a raise in tuition.
The administration heard these frantic pleas. This
year they are not planning to raise tuition, they are
planning to cut the amount of scholarship aid.

2 . IT IS UN CLEAR what the other alternatives are to solving
the school’s present ﬁscal prblems,

but these alternatives

should be investigated more thoroughly.

Everyone who is mentally capable of college work
deserves to be in college. Ideally, then, money should not
be a determing factor in a person‘s education. Those
who are bright enough and cannot afford to attend col-
lege should have their way paid for them.

All who want it deserve the same chance in the pur-

suit of a college education. It
is not that way in this coun-
try now, nor will it ever be
that way. But at least we
can try to approach the ideal
of equal opportunity for all.

The University is not ap-
proaching this ideal by con-
sidering a scholarship cut; it
is going against the ideal. ’

A scholarship cut is not,
however, out of line with the
present University policy to-
ward its undergraduates.
Russell A. Dixon, Associate
Dean of the Liberal Arts,
once told me, “Young man,
you have to understand that
this University is not design-
ed for the undergraduates.”
At the time, I was puzzled
by Dean Dixon’s remark. I
am no longer puzzled.

If the University can’t af-
ford to build any more, then
let it build less. If the Uni-
versity can’t meet costs, then
let it cut costs. But don’t
make the students pay for a
building they'll never use,
and don’t take the chance to
learn away from those w-ho
can barely afford it now.

for his first score of the afternoon. Tippy Pohl (11) and Bernie La-

UNIVERSlTY PARK, PA.
—— Pitt, with a 3-4-2 record,
played like a team with an
0-9 record here Saturday
against Penn State, a team
with a 5-4 record, which
played like an unbeaten squad,
and the results were obvious,
28-0.

The Lions scored the first time .
they had the ball and then broke
up a promising Panther drive
with an interception to clearly
show to the Panthers that this
was the ~Lion’s game and the
Panthers had better not try to
prove otherwise.

Senior fullback Tom Urbanik
ran for 93 yardsin the ﬁrst half
to pace the Lions to a 20-0 lead

after 30 minutes of play.

After the game the Panthers
told what had been obvious to
record crowd of 50,170. Eric

‘Crabtree said, “I’d like to play,
Notre Dame again, but I want no V

part of Penn State. Without a
doubt they were the best we
played.”

Then Crabtree gave the reason
—a reason which had ben obvi-
ous to the huge crowd—why the
Panthers were so badly beaten."
“We weren’t up,” he said. “It
was the last game of the season.
A lot of guys wanted to get it
over with.”

Ray Popp was not so direct as
Crabtree. Playing the role of cap-
tain to the end, Popp denied that
the Panthers were not up for
Penn State the way they were
ready for Notre Dame and Army.
But earlier Popp said much what

Quinta, try to make the stop. Penn State won the game, 28-0.

‘We Weren’t Up,’ Says Crabtree;
Z8-O Score Proves Flim Right

Crabtree had noted, when he
commented, “They wanted it
more than us.”

But Penn State was more than
just a ﬁred up team. They were
a talented team. Because of this
the inevitable comparison with
Notre Dame was made. Coach
John Michelosen said, “I don’t
like to make comparisons. But
Penn State was more ﬁred up for
us. They’ wanted it more than
Notre Dame.”

‘So many of the present seniors
who made such vital contribu-
tions to last year’s great team,
ended their careers on a dismal
note. -

But 11 all-America players
couldn’t have helped the Pan-
thers Saturday if they had the

' “Pitt-attitude.”

Alternatives

_ The University is consider-
mg reducing the number of-
scholarships and g'rants-jn-
aid, Possibly by as much as
25 per cent. The decision to
cut aid although not deﬁnite,
is one of the
alternatives to
solving the Uni-
versity’s budget
problems.

An_ official Uni-
versity source -
said that the
budget commit-

— — vv tee was plan-

CARVER ning to meet at
least two to three more times this
terms before making any deﬁnite. "L
decisions. “The school is deﬁnite-
1y in budgetary problems,” the
source explained,” and l the ad.
iustment has to be made some-
where. The change might be
made somewhere else, though,

and not in aid. We’re not sure
yet.”

 

A. University spokesman did
admit, ‘however, that there would‘;
Very llkely be a change in the A
amount of scholarships and
grants-in-aid, and that the ad-
justment in scholarships was
much more likely to be a de.
crease than an increase.

The committee is considering

. an across-the-board cut in schol-

ars aid, which could mean a re-
duction of many types of scholar.

ships, including academic scholar-
ships, and grants-in-aid.

Athletic Director Frank Carver
expects a cut in the number of
athletic grants he will have avail.-
able for next year. “Nothing is “.
deﬁnite yet,” he said, “but the
outlook is not good.” Although
Carver was unable to conﬁrm
any deﬁnite budget cut, he ad-
mitted that there would have to
be a re-evaluation of the athletic '
program for next year.

“We'll just have to get the
maximum good out of what we
get,” Carver said.

Boaters Upend Penn State

By BILL CABIN

After four consecutive losses, the soccer team’
brought its potential to fruition last Friday at
Schenley Oval by downing Penn State, 2-1. The win
gives the booters a season record of 5-5.

“It was their best game all year,” said coach
Leo Bemis. “We looked like a real ball team, and
had good sharp passing and improved shooting.”
The booters outshot the Lions, 10-7, making 20 per

cent of their shots.

“When we move on offense, I’d play in front of

them, which enabled me to cut off their (Penn
State’s) attack at mid field.”’

Penn State played a man-to-man defense and,
“they just could not adjust,” said Bemis, “Mc-
Graw and Shimpino acted as free agents, and Mc-
Graw was left free to play the play.”

“I used the same defense four or five years ago,”
said Bemis, but he had not comment as to why he

*6’ .

V

did not use it more this season.

“The team was just fired up,” said co-captain

Any McGraw. “I knew it after the first five min-
utes. The guys really put out, and we had a team

effort.”

Aiding the team’s enthusiasm was the use of rov-
ing defense, Instead of using the usual five man
line (two wings, two insides, and center forward),
the booteds employed a four man line. One of the
insides would shift to a halfback slot, and halfback
George Sommer would move to a fullback position.

This allowed center halfback McGraw and center

the booters.

Shimpino, acting as a rover, played all over the
field as contrasted to the stationary position he
assumed the rest of the year. He harrassed the
Nittany Lions by constantly weaving in and out
along the line, using tactics similar to All-America
Eberhard Klein who led Maryland to a 6-3 win over

Aldo Zortea and Shimpinovscored the booter‘s
goals, as Shimpino won the team scoring title withé

When John Bai1ey’s fami-
ly stopped on cross country
trips, he would get out and
run around. the car. He’s
been running ever since.

“My mother once told me
that when we stopped at a motel
on our way to Oregon, I got out
of the car and continually ran
around for no apparent reason,”
Bailey recalled. '

“Bailey’s been the most consis-
tent man on the cross country
team for three years,” said coach
Jim Banner. “He, Damien Koch.
and Dave Eichenlaub are our
top runners.”

Bailey ran track three years
and cross country two years at
Kennett High School in Kennett
Square, Pa. In state scholastic
competition, he placed tenth in

cross country and fourth in the _

mile.

“I’ve been running since I was
a kid,” said Bailey. “I used to
run races with other kids, and
never’ got tired. I didn't have the
size or. talent necessary for other

sports, so I began distance run-
ning.” ,

Cross country runners don't
get much glory. There are no
cheering crowds, no pep rallies,
no bands or cheerleaders. Yet
Bailey takes pride in being a
runner.

“Running is an individual chal-
lenge,” he said. “You’re on your
own, and there’s no one to cheer
you along a four mile course.
We’re lucky if there’s 25 or 30
spectators at a meet.”

Bailey ha'd offers from Michi-
gan State, Penn State, Florida,
and Wake Forest, but Pitt gave
him a four year full tuition pack-
age scholarship. Bailey runs both
track and cross country under
the scholarship terms.

As a sophomore, Bailey set the
school record for the three mile,
and last year he ran the mile in
4:16, two seconds -short of the
school record. 

“Running the two or three mile
takes more endurance and less
Speed than the mile,” Bailey said.
“I was injured last year, and
ran the mile, but I’ll return to
the two mile this year.”

 

Bailey had a break from col-
legiate running during July and
August, but he still runs. “I
usually go up to my aunt’s place
in Maine for a few weeks and
run between 10 and 12 miles.”

As captain of this year’s un-
defeated cross country team,
Bailey says, “There was a lot
less tension this year, and we
enjoyed running more.”

a 600 hp gas turbine engine permits a cruising speed of 70 miles per hour, a non-stop range of 600 miles.
Designed for long-distance, non-stop operation, the two-man cab includes sleeping facilities, fold-away table,
lavatory, toilet, oven, refrigerator and TV for the co-driver-—with over 6'3" of headroom. Because of its
cruising speed, the truck will be compatible with the normal passenger car ﬂowrate of traffic.
Other unique features are its odorless exhaust and extremely quiet operation.

Anticipating the opportunities and needs of the future is standard practice at Ford Motor Company.
That's why it's such an exciting place to work. Look to Ford Motor Company for a career with growth potential
and satisfaction—from pure science to manufacturing . . . marketing to labor relations.
