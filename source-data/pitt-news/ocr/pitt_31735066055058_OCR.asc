Students, parents, faculty and administration members
gathered for the annual Honors Convocation, held yester-
day in Soldiers and Sailors to celebrate the outstanding
accomplishments of those in the academic community.

Student academic awards were given to members of Phi
Beta Kappa, the Golden Key National Honor Society and
Phi Eta Sigma as well as to University Scholars, students
who are in the top two percent of their academic schools.

“The goal of education is achieved in the very process
of learning,” Barbara Graves, a Wilma Binder Zeder
Memorial Scholarship winner, said when she responded
on behalf of all the student academic award winners.

“There is a special satisfaction to being recognized by
your own institution,” William Yurcik, who was awarded
the Siemens Rolm Communications, Inc. Scholarship and
accepted in the name of all graduate student honorees.

Student leadership awards were given to members of
Alpha Sigma Lambda, Lambda Sigma, Omicron Delta
Kappa and the Mortar Board Society.

There were also two individual leadership awards given.
The Emma W. Locke Award was presented to Gary J.
Knapick in recognition of his high scholarship, character
and devotion to the university. Julie Crowell was awarded
the Omicron Delta Kappa Senior or the Year Award for
her leadership roles in college activities. '

“The college experience is what you make it.

Dean leading Pitt

into the 2 1 st century -

By Cesca Antonelli
Staff Writer

(This is the ﬁnal part of a four-part series about the KickStart
Initiative and the push for improved access to the Information
Superhighway. )

Toni Carbo Bearman, Pitt’s dean of SLIS and an avid
Penguins fan, recently returned from Washington after working
on the Advisory Council on the Information Superhighway to
help provide communities with new ‘boards to surf the Net.

“I want to be the kind of dean that Mario Lemieux is hockey
player,” Bearman said with a broad smile. “You skate where
the puck is going.”

Since the Advisory Council issued the KickStart Initiative
and disbanded in mid-February, Bearman can focus her atten-
tion on the three other positions she currently holds, in addition
to being dean.

She is on the American Association for the Advancement of
Science Council. She is vice-chair of,the U.S. National
Committee for the International Federation of Information and

Documentation, where she chairs both the Global Information .

Infrastructures and Superhighways Task Forces and the

"Information Policy Committee. She is also president-elect of

the Association for Library and Information Science
Educators.

“I get very little sleep,” she said repeatedly, and though she
rubbed her eyes, she was smiling.

Bearman gratefully acknowledged the extensive work of her
staff, especially David Wallace, a doctoral student in SLIS,

who dedicated 30 hours per week for the past year and a half to .

helping with research, attending meetings and writing sections
of the report.
“[Bearman] was very collaborative,” Wallace said. “It was
work that both of us had done, and it was a very valuable expe-

Benefit concert to  
rockior Kevin Cecil

By Mark Gordon and
Nicole Walz
The Pitt News

What started out as a senseless act of violence has
turned into a year-long fundraising effort that’s now in
full swing.

Pitt senior Kevin Cecil was shot in the back in July:
the wound left him a quadriplegic for life. _

A few weeks after, one of his close friends, Pitt student
Mike Sofranco, organized a town meeting to discuss vio-
lence on P.itt’s campus.

And from there, it took off. -

Concerned students, one who never met Cecil before.
wrote letters to The Pitt News and The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, asking people not to forget what happened.

Police said tips they received from those letters aided
in the eventual arrest of three suspects, who are now set
to stand trial for attempted murder in April.

But the charity work started in September. when
Cecil’s medical bills began to skyrocket. Some of Cecil‘s
friends before the shooting, and some new ones. have
been working all year to raise money for the engineering
student. The ultimate goal is a specialized van he could
drive.

Next up on the fundraising agenda is a concert on
March 30 at Bellfield Hall. The concert runs from 3 to ll
p.m and bands slated to play include Dharma Sons. Dead
Fuzzy and the Ike McCoy Band, winners of a phase at
the Grafitti Rock Challenge earlier this month.

UNITED NATIONS — The

WASHINGTON — Citing the

for peace in the Middle East,
President Clinton requested
Congressional approval for

Under the plan, the United

the leases of four F—16B’s.
Eventually, the title on the air-

PHOENIX — Millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes climbed
out of the grave that political
pundits had dug for him to win
all 39 delegates in Arizona’s
winner-take-all primary.

With 66 percent of Arizona’s
vote tallied, Forbes was lead-
ing with 34 percent. Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole (29
percent)’ and conservative com-
mentator Pat Buchanan (27
percent) battled for second.

Coupled with his win

WILMINGTON, Del. -
Nine Episcopal Church bishops
began to consider whether a
bishop who ordained a gay
man as a deacon should
become the first person in 72
years to be tried by the church
as a heretic.

Walter S. Righter, a 73-year-
old retired Bishop from Iowa,
was accused last summer of
teaching false doctrine, the def-
inition of heresy, for having
signed a statement that backed
the ordination of homosexuals.
The Bishop was also accused
of violating his own ordination
vows by ordaining a gay man
as a deacon. The New York
Times

WASHINGTON — Saying he
had “studied and prayed about
the issue,” President Clinton, in
a letter to Congress, urges law-
makers to amend a bill that
would outlaw a late—term abor-
tion so it would allow excep-
tions for cases where the life or
health of a woman was at risk.
The White House has said
repeatedly that the President
would veto either the House or
Senate versions of the bill in
their current form, but this was
the first time that Mr. Clinton
himself had addressed the
issue. The New York Times

fundraising efforts. A sam-
pling of some other events:

°The 18th Annual Hand—
In—Hand Festival for handi-
capped children will take
place on March 23 on the
first floor of Forbes Quad.
Each year, approximately
500 hundred Pitt students
volunteer for the one—day
event as facilitators, clowns
and one—on-one volunteers
as they organize a festival
for area children with spe-
cial needs. The carnival—1ike
atmosphere draws in any-
where from 250 to 300 chil-

“People are still needed to
be clowns and one—on-one
volunteers, and we’d like
more student organizations

Greek Sing on March 21 and
a dance marathon on March
23. Last year, Greek Week
participants raised over
$100,000 for Family House.

°Family House and the
University of Pittsburgh are
sponsoring a 12-hour dance
marathon on March 22 and
23 beginning at 7 p.m. At
the marathon, there will be

rience in that regard. To be treated as a
peer is much more engaging [than
working hard and getting little or no
credit]. We worked together to devel-
op positions.”

Bearman also advises private com-
panies like AT&T about how to build
links in the community, similar to the
proposals in the KickStart Initiative.
She provides her expertise as an infor-
mation policy expert to these compa-
nies in an effort to bring technology to
the community level.

“Sharing information is part of what
universities are about,” Bearman said.

Bearman also worked hard during
her time with the Advisory Council to
bring Pitt into the fold by
holding the meetings of her
section of the Council here.

“It gives us positive [public
relations] in major compa-
nies, not just for recruiting
purposes, but in case we have
a need in the future from
them,” Bearman explained.

Even before being appoint-
ed to the Advisory Council
by Secretary of Commerce
Ron Brown, Bearman was no
stranger to advising the
President and U.S. Congress
on policy in the information
science field. Before becom-
ing dean in 1986, she spent
six years as the executive
director of the National
Commission on Libraries and
Information Science.

Bearman has extensive

international experience as
well. She was named a U.S.
representative to the G—7
Round Table of Business
Leaders to the G—7 confer-
ence in Brussels last year.
The G—7 delegation was the
first time the private sector
was included in talks about
information in society.
Eleven pilot projects with
other nations about electronic
libraries, museums and gal-
leries began after the meet-
ing.

Bearman chaired the U.S.
delegation to the general
council meeting of UNESCO
General Information
Programme in 1984 and was
a member of the delegation in
1982. She has chaired numer-
ous other international con-
ference committees and has

Future improvements that Bearman
and Wallace are struggling for include
a greater link between Pitt and the

community.

“It is the responsibility of institutes
of higher learning to give back to the
community,” Wallace said.

Wallace also cited other possible
future improvements within the com-
munity. There need to be multiple ter-
minals and trained staff in public
libraries. Libraries and community
centers could extend access after
hours. Public K-12 schools would
probably need to cut down into small-
er classes.

Can we ever expect the push for uni-
versal access to the Net to take hold?

“Some of these things start small,‘

but they keep growing and mushroom-

City slaps Pitt in the face

Fellow students at the University of Pittsburgh, you are not irnpor—
tant! At least according to Pittsburgh City Council President Jim Ferlo,

 you’re not. Neither you nor the incredible amount of money you feed

into the local economy make a difference, so you might as well just
pack up-and leave. They don’t want us here.
That is, more or less, the message we have just been sent by our

. esteemed city council president, when he convinced Mayor Tom
 Murphy to delay plans to shut down Bigelow Boulevard in front of the
3 Cathedral. Some of Oakland’s residents petitioned City Council, and

A ___,  ...—-1-A-A

l
l
'l

 

, Ferlo agreed that it might not be in the interest of the few people who
1 live here permanently to shut down the road.

What Ferlo forgot was that this was only a trial closing. His decision
to ﬁght the closing neglected the idea that the trial might very well put
the issue to rest if it didn’t work out. But now the ﬁght will likely con-
tinue, as it has for years.

The university provides a tremendous service to Pittsburgh’s other-
wise stagnant economy. If the school was not here, Oakland wouldn’t
be here either. One might think anything which improved the school,
and made it more attractive to prospective students, might be favored
by the community and the city. One might also think that the city might
be a little less inclined to slap Pitt in the face every chance it got. But
apparently some people just didn’t feel like driving a whole extra block
to get to their community group meetings, where they can decide how
else they can screw students.

One of Ferlo’s colleagues on the council had this condescending lit-
tle tidbit of advice for all of us: “I think Pitt students are old enough to
look both ways before they cross the street” (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
Feb.28). Thank you, Dan Cohen. We’re sure drivers are all old enough
not to speed through the first two seconds of a red light. And we’re
extra sure they are all mature enough to yield to pedestrians in a cross-
walk. And we think they are all old enough to not pull up an extra three
inches while waiting at a red light just so no stupid kid can step in front
of their precious car.

Finally, we’re sure that crossing Bigelow Boulevard is dangerous
even if you follow every rule of being a pedestrian, crossing only when
the light is red and only in the crosswalk.

The only other thing we are sure of is that if we, as members of the
Uriiversity of «Pittsburgh, were not here then Oakl_and~.~.wou1d- ._not be

here either. Businesses are concerned that sales will suffer if Bigelow is ’

closed? I-low much would they suffer if none of us were here? Traffic
might be backed up in Oakland? (That would be something new!)
How far back will it get the next time a pedestrian is hit crossing the
road?

Yes, Mr. Cohen, we are all old enough to look both ways. But we are
also old enough to vote. And you should seriously think about the fact
that we can read and make intelligent decisions the next time you
decide to insult us, as well as our school. ‘

cowboy would care about
that fact.

So it’s easy to ignore their
thoughts. But when William
F. Buckley sounds like he
wants the Grateful Dead to
re-form, with himself as the
new guitarist, it deserves a
response.

While the arguments are
thoughtful and logical, they
do not convince me that hard
drugs will ever be legalized.
We have a Congress that has ,
quit trying to pass a budget
that was due four months
ago. If this group even con-
siders debating a real drug
reform law, I’ll let Carlton
Haselrig borrow my car for a
month. Plus, 85 percent of
the American public cannot
see how having crack avail-
able in Rite-Aid will possi-
bly benefit society. The
essays in NR do almost
nothing to explain how that
attitude will change. ’

But what about pot? There

on
enry

is som_e popular support for
its legalization, and there are
plenty of people who point
out that Vstoners aren’t
responsible for the street
crimes that other drug users
often commit. Nor are they
responsible, they argue, for

addingto overdose statistics, -'
 "'l’aV~-rr"»_-.r-'s«"‘«. rm-z~ L.i-van’: r- -z - '«<‘
as there IS no Known lethal

dosage for pot. To hear them
tell it, the only things dope
smokers are responsible for
is the existence of a 24-hour
Cartoon Network and the
Beastie Boys’ career.
They’re right, by the way.

But before we all start lob- t

bying for.-m”arij'uana’s legal-
ization, while buying grow
lights and Monty Python

tapes in hopeful anticipation,

remember one thing: dope
smokers aren’t responsible
for anything else, either.
That includes jobs, bills and
things like that. _
That’s no small problem,
considering these facts, all
of which I found in the arti-
cle: there are already five
million regular dope smok-
ers (a number, by the way,
that I, don’t trust. Between
high school,‘ college and my
neighborhood, I think I’ve
met five million regular
dope smokers). With them,

,there are 70 million that

have tried it at least once.
Assuming they’d do it more
often if it were legal, I think
there would be a 25 percent
increase in heavy usage with
these people (something
similar happened in the first
years after Prohibition). If
this happens, there will be
22.5 million regular marijua-
na smokers.

Imagine a typical business
day in this kind of climate.

The best,
worst of the

Big East

 

Pitt awaits Mounties, Storm, Big East Tourney

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer

With the Big East
Tournament less than a week
away, teams are packing their
bags and booking their trips to

come soon enough for each of
these teams. Ralph ’Willard’s
Panthers come into the game
with a 9-15 mark, 4-12 in the
Big East. Pitt started out the
season 8-3 but dropped 12 of

   

its last 13 games. The lone
win was a 75-69 defeat of
Seton Hall back on Jan. 30.
The Mountaineers have
compiled a 12-13, 7-10 in the
Big East mark under Coach

Gordon

ust in time for the
Grammy’s, it’s The. Pitt
News sports staff’s end—of-

the-year awards and predictions.
If you want to see what the

' other clowns who write for this

staff think about the Big East and
its upcoming tournament, turn
the page.'But here’s mine. Enjoy.

Player of the Year — Ray
Allen, UConn

Allen edges out Allen Iverson,
for the simple reason that Allen
involves more players in the
offense. I’m not just talking
about assists, either. Allen does
whatever it takes to get a win,
while Iverson does whatever it
takes to improve his NBA
prospects.

Allen makes everybody
around him better. Travis Knight
and Kirk King are solid players,

but they picked it up this year

behind Allen.

The junior shooting guard
scores 23 pointsa game, less
than a point behind 1verson.. He
leads the conference in 3-point
percentage and threes per game,

' and he’s third in free-throw per-

centage. Even during his off
games he stills plays tough

' defense and scores 15 points.

Sure, Iverson leads the Big.
East in steals, but he’s also No. 1
in turnovers. And in case you
missed the game at the Civic
Arena on Jan.1l, Iverson was 4-
for-15 from the ﬁeld and 1-for-
l0 from 3-point range against
Pitt. Not exactly stellar numbers.

Iverson is a great player, but
he’s a notch below Allen.

Big East Champion --
UConn

Allen and his backcourt mate,
Doron Sheffer, fonn the best duo
in the country. “With Knight and
King, the Huskies will roll into
the NCAAs as Big East champs
and a likely No.1 seed. UConn
scores the most in the Big East
and gives up the least amount of
points per game. Plus, it might
be able to play Pitt in the touma-
ment, and that will get it into a
groove.

Jim Calhoun and his crew
have a legitimate chance to make
it to the Meadowlands for the
Final Four, and, who knows,
maybe_John Ca1apari’s New
England dream game will come
true.

Before the Big East men take to» the
tournament hardwood, the women will get
a chance in the spotlight. The Gampel

day Big East Women’s Basketball
Championship, starting on March 2.

Homecourt heroines and No.1 seed, the
Connecticut Huskies are angling for their
second straight Big East Tournament win.
Coming in this year without an undefeat-
ed record or last year's superstar Rebecca
Lobo, UConn needs the Big East title to
ensure a No. 1 slot in the NCAA tourna-
ment. j ‘

Leading the team is junior center Kara
Walters, who was named Big East Player
of the Week last week after averaging 22
points and nine rebounds in the squad’s
two contests. '

The 6-foot-7 Wolters is averaging 17.4
per game, eight ‘rebounds, and leads the
Big East with 2.5 blocks per game.’

Nykesha Sales scores 16.8 per game and‘

Six linger Sllalalilﬂs

  

Lately, Ska has been giving itself a
bad name. it’s the Next Big Thing, the
newest latest, a way to make powerful
friends and influence people. Hell, l’ve
even heard you can use ska music to
meet chicks! If only it had been that way
a tiny bit earlier, maybe 30 years earlier,
the people who invented the music
wouldn’t have lived the intermittent
decades in relative poverty.

Instead, there’s an ever-growing pop-
ulation of American bands waving the
checkered flag and spitting out hard-
core punk tinged rock with a funny gui-
tar rhythm. Their intentions are good,
hearts in the right place, but the music
lacks the soul -that spawned the music
in Jamaica in the late ‘50s. These
records are available to anyone — just
grab something by any band with a
name like Skankin’ Pickle or the Mighty
Mighty anythings. Meanwhile, Prince
Buster is relegated to agolden find at
Jerry’s Used Records.

Who is Prince Buster? I’m sure you
could find out by going to Judge
Knotte’s courtroom tonight at Graffiti,
where the Stubborn All-Stars will stand

as defendants in the ska trial of the cen- .

tury, and once you find out, there’s no
going back. - .
Stubborn All-Stars, whom I refuse to
call a ska supergroup (or did I just do
that ...), are comprised of veterans of
the New York ska music world, with a
little help from people like Roland
Alphonso, whose Skatalites practically
invented ska/rocksteady/reggae music
those decades ago. They play a soulful
revue of ska (how many times can I
write that word?), dub, rocksteady, reg-
gae and anything else that is of
Jamaican birth. The band's first full-
length album, Open Season (available
from Stubborn Records), is an oasis to
the ska fanatic. Running the gamut of
Skatalites-y instrumentals (“Rich
Morrissey,” a tribute to a comrade, not a
crack on alternative rock), Sound

System-styled -toasts in the Dennis

 

Alcaponel U-Roy tradition (“Open
Season”), a ‘90s update of the Prince
Buster “Judge Dread” series (“Judge
Knotte”) and straightfonrvard Toots Ska
(“Rise to Find You”), the album would

actually be a great primer on the music.

for the uninitiated.

Beyond the rare modern ska qualities
of having talented musicians, and hav-
ing a band that actually TAKES ITSELF
SERIOUSLY (SHlT!), the All-Stars have
managed to compose songs that are
both original, and within the tradition.
Songs such as “Rise to Find You” or
“Catch That Train" are derived from
American roots music and soul, strained.
through the Jamaican traditions of the
forefathers and siphoned out again
through the minds of New York rude-
boys. Take, for an example,
“Lieutenant,” the song that ends and, in
a Scratch Perry fashion, begins Open
Season. The song’s biblical tone (“So
open up thy mouth, sing a new song to
the Lordl Upon thy left a shield, upon
thy right a fiery sword”) would appear at
first listen to be hopelessly anachronis-
tic. However, the experimental dub
framework of the song (heavy drum
beats floating in and out of the rhythm,
horns in staccato ether) makes for a
timelessness that truly apocalyptic
music has in any decade.

At tonight's Grafitti concert, however,
the apocalyptic and the classroom will
give way to the dancefloor courtroom,

where an all-too-often seated Pittsburgh‘

crowd must beware the wrath of singer
King Django. I have no fear of a thumb-
twiddling audience, however, with a
groove as infectious as the true ska.
After all, if you don't dance to ska, what
the hell are you going to do with it?
Write reviews? ' ’

Stubborn All-Stars will perform tonight
at Grafitti in North Oakland around 8:3_O
tonight, Feb. 29, with support from
locals Bunjie Jambo. Unuh must listen
keenly! Love, Skavoovie ‘

1969 was an important year for revi-
talizing America’s interest in its own
traditional music forms of country and
folk. it brought the Rolling Stones’
failed and violent attempt at music fes-
tival debauchery (the Altamont
Speedway Concert near San
Francisco) -‘- and, ultimately, the end
of the psychedelic era. In 1970, rock
bands turned their backs on the drug-
laden youth culture of the ‘60s and
began rediscovering their roots. The
Byrds hadadded a steel-pedal guitar
and country riffs to their sound and
were receiving much critical acclaim
for the heavily southern-tinged
Sweetheart of the Rodeo; while. Bob
Dylan responded one year later with
his own country masterpiece,
Nashville Skyline. Today, a back-to-
basics roots rock sound is returning
with an amazing popularity to main-
stream music. Not surprisingly, some
of the best is coming from lesser

known talents (Palace Brothers,

Freakwater, Blue Mountain,
Volebeats) on independent labels, or
from largely unpopular bands on major
labels that have yet to receive the
attention that their music deserves
(Bottle Rockets, Jayhawks, Wilco).
The majority of the mainstream
media has chosen to ignore the recent
resurgence of traditional roots rock,
although VH-1’s Crossroads (which
uses the first few bars of the

Jayhawks’ “Blue” as-. its intro music)

regularly showcases new acoustic,
folk-tinged bands and recently fea-
tured a live in-studio performance by
current alternative/country champions
Son Volt. The Nashville Network
(TNN) also occasionally covers
promising new talent; Big Sandy & His
Fly-Rite Boys (an impressive rockabil-
ly/country act), were featured during a
recent piece on crossover country
bands. -
Surprisingly, the most knowledge-

es: es in
Seattle, in the form of the new
NoDepression fanzine (named after
Uncle Tupe|o’s first album) — a quar-
terly magazine which places a major
emphasis on unsigned, alternative-
country acts (write to PO Box 31332,
Seattle, WA 98103 or e-mail
NoDepress@aol.com). Also, send $1
to Music City Texas fanzine, (620
Circle Ave, Round Rock, TX 78664)
and read about diverse American
music genres such as Cajun, Swamp
Pop, Zydeco, Conjunto and
Rockabilly. The following are brief
descriptions of talented bands recom-
mended to anyone interested in
exploring the alternative/country
genre.

 

The Jayhawks — Tomorrow the
Green Grass (American) Required lis-
tening for fans of the insurgent coun-
try/pop sound, the Jayhawks’ newest
release is also their least country influ-
enced, lending itself to more of an
easy pop sound heavy with sweet riffs
-and soaringmelodies. The songwriting

’ team of guitarists Mark Olsen and

Gary Louris make for an arresting slew
of southern-pop tunes unparalleled by
any in popular music today.

Palace Brothers — Days in the Wake
(Drag City) Notorious for changing
their name with every album, they've
also been known as Palace, Palace
Music and Palace Songs. The sound
of Palace is more along the lines of
minimalist folk/pop. Their rootsy, hon-
est sound is a refreshing alternative to
the loud guitar bands that seem to
dominate today's pop scene. ‘

Freakwater — Old Paint (Thrill
Jockey) Featuring two women on
vocals, Freakwater maintains the most
obvious,“real country" sound and has
been compared to thedismal blue-

. - Eldridge to eight

Polvo means dust (or pow-
der) in Spanish. That fact has
nothing to do with my review
— I just thought some of you
kids might like to impress your
friends with a small bit of

knowledge.

Chapel Hill, N.C., has.

released another 21 minutes

ves. Polvo’s sound is devel-
oping into such an intricate
state that it is impossible to
describe with a few words or
words at all.

The new release, This

    

Eclipse, might best be under-
stood by the first words of the
first song: “l heard the echoes
from space." This song,
“batradar,” introduces listen-
ers to the push and pull that is
Po|vo’s sound. Ears never
become bored by repetition or
overpowered by vocals, put
plainly, each instrument has a
turn to speak for itself.

The most beautiful aspect
of this EP is the metamorphic
quality that all of the songs
possess. Some listeners
might not enjoy the high-
pitched melody that the third
track, “titanup,” is borne with,
but they may appreciate the
lower-toned melody that
quickly consumes the song
before it crawls into a cocoon

of rhythm and harmony.
“Titanup” flows directly into
the fourth track, “production-
values,” allowing the emer-
gence of a calm and sweet
sound, before it ends with the
“titletrack.” This is when ador-
ing listeners begin to feel sad.
We long for the release of a
double album on Touch and
Go Records and a tour.

So you’ve never listened to
Polvo, but my well-written
review has gotten you inter-
ested, and you want to know
if you’re cool enough’ to
appreciate it, right? Well it’s
not about cool, and its not
about what I have to say, it’s
all about using your newfound
Spanish word: “Hey mom, did
you notice there is a ton of
polvo in the house?"

The Cardigans
Life
(Minty Fresh)

imagine, if you will, a sim-
pler ,time_ -— a time when

bands could write unabashed
pop melodies paired with hon-
est sentiments, a time when
clean-cut boys had honest
intentions and_cute girls didn’t
have to know better, a time
when a good suit was your
ticket in to the most happen-
ing spots. With a tap on the
vibraphone and a brush on
the drums, Sweden’s
Cardigans play host (and
hostess) to their own private
party called Life, where such
virtues are still deemed
essential.

They invite’ you in (if you’re
lucky enough to be on the list)
and offer you a martini and a
seat between Holly Golightly
and John Steed. House
chanteuse Nina proceeds to
sing the praises of “cocktails
in the evening sun” at
“Gordon’s Gardenparty" and a
desire to “make you mine-in a
merry-go-round" at the
“Carnival,” while the boys turn
on their Teutonic charm and
display their encyclopedic
knowledge of the finer points
of the esteemed three-minute
pop song. “Tomorrow” begins

with. a groove that Berry
Gordy would be proud to call
his own, while “Ce|ia lnside”
boasts the kind of guitar that
would make the Girl from
lpanema smile (not to men-
tion some snazzy orchestra-
tion that would make Seﬁor
‘Esquivel feel like a proud
father). They play each note
as if every day were the first
day of summer and they have
an endless allowance from
daddy’s bank account.

The (perpetual) bounce in
their step is infectious and
evidence that they have never
seen the suicide rate statistics
of their fellow countrymen.
But theirs is not merely a cos-
tume party paying homage to
an idealized pop past. As the
submerged strains of electric
piano and disco—esque strings
become more evident they
hint more at Farah Fawcett
than Audrey Hepburn.
Clearly, polyester is just as
welcome at their soirée as
sharkskin.

But as all good things must,
the party eventually draws to

ll/l;I<1“

   
  
   

an en .
ful combo, the Cardigans were
considerate enough to pen the
perfect morning-after song,
“Rise and Shine.” At the
inevitable close of their, party
Nina implores, “I want to be
alone for a while  I want the
sun to be down.” Some people
just know how to throw a party.
—Kevin Smith

Aimee Mann

That
DGC

Aimee who? That’s probably
what a lot of people are saying
about a bright young pop artist,
Aimee Mann. Some of us older
college folk may (while dating
ourselves) remember teeny-
bopping to ‘Til Tuesday’s
“Voices Carry.” Perhaps you
remember the bottle-blonde
beauty who mesmerized MTV-
watching teens with more than
just vocal ability. Now it is all
starting to come back now,

- isn’t it? That Aimee Mann!!-!

Oh! Remember now?

‘Til Tuesday was a band
that, to paraphrase Neil
Young, hit the middle of the
road and then headed for the
ditch. It had its 15 minutes and
was gone. That was the ‘80s.
Well, it is the mid-90s now,
and Aimee Mann is out on her
own with a new album and a
more mature East Coast pop
sound. She gets by with a little
help from friends like Juliana
Hatfield, Stacy Jones and
teen-pop guru Michael Penn.
What you get is the solid, fun
and even reflective album, ‘‘I’m
With Stupid.”

With the power of DGC
(Geffen Records) behind the
album, Mann scored a minor
hit with the song “That’s Just
What You Are.” It appeared, in
all places, on a Melrose Place.

as well, but it’s perhaps the
song least consistent with the
feel of Mann’s writing. “That’s
Just What You Are” is, like the
rest of the album, a slickly pro-
duced, stripped—down pop
gem. Mann’s songs are full of
catchy hooks and heck-you-
can-dance-to-it beats. But
“That’s Just What You Are” is
more hip-hop club music than
is the rest of the album. Most
of Mann’s tunes are simple
pop songs with pretty stan-
dard, though perhaps a bit wit-
tier than the norm, lyrics.

The real treat of this album
is the sound. I am a sucker for
slick audiophile production,
and this album, thanks to pro-
ducer Jon Brion, boasts some
of the coolest guitar tones l’ve
heard_for a while. But if you
are in search of the next heir to
the Seattle Sound, you are
looking in the wrong place.
Mann isn’t even close to what
you would call grunge. In fact,
she uses fuzztones and distor-
tion with pinpoint accuracy, not
to create a chaotic wall of
sound but to create space and
tension in her music.

Some of the songs, like the
album opener, “Long Shot,”
are a ca_rniva| of delight for
headphone lovers. “|t’s Not
Safe” features some real nice
guitar work by Michael Penn.
Some of the slower songs get
sappy, and many of the songs
ramble on a bit too long for
pop. But Mann’s songwriting
sensibilities cover the kind of
ground that Matthew Sweet,
Robert Quine, Sheryl Crow
and Luna have tried to take on.

There are strong Beatles,
Velvet Underground and
Television influences that
shine through. Although Mann
comes closer to the mark than
I think artists like Sweet or
Luna have, she still fails a bit
short. Her voice is lacking at

.times, as are her lyrics. She

follows a good direction in
songwriting structure but still

T urs., Fe uary 29

needs a little polish. But don’t
write off Aimee yet. If you like
good, clean pop with a bit of
New York Factory flare, you
will still probably enjoy this
album. And if Aimee Mann
continues to mature as a song-
writer and keeps her ideas (not
to mention producer Jon Brion)
about sound intact, we may yet
see great things from Aimee.

Walleye
Familiar, Forgotten
Jade Tree

Walleye’s latest release fea-
tures a sepia-tone photo of a
‘30s era family sitting on the
running board of a black sedan
on its cover. Are you thinking
emo yet? How about the diner-
menu font? Yes, this is emo
hardcore with a DC feel. But
Walleye’s use of dynamics
and, God forbid, good taste
actually elevate the album
beyond the ranks of records
white suburban kids will buy
then throw out after they join a
fraternity. This album can actu-
ally stand up as music a non-
hardcore kid would buy.

Chunk? Stop action riffs?
Minor chords? Long 4/4
grooves? It's all there. Loud
vocals abound, with sustained
notes characteristic of emo
sounds. At the same time, the
album has deft melodic ability
and a complexity that lifts the
music above the repetitive,
whiny tendencies of emocore.
The fact that the band photo
features a guy in a Don
Caballero T-shirt should tip
you off to the fact that Walleye
can do more.

Chunk is offset with more
delicate, laidback verse work.
The straightahead feel of most
hardcore is balanced by speed
and even some time changes
that mix up the songs into mul-
tipart grooves reminiscent of

Kerosene 454. Stop-action riffs
blend with relaxed Edsel-
esque counterparts that some-
how mesh to form a themati-
cally consistent sound.
Walleye also effectively blends
a full-voiced attack with good
individually voiced sections.

And the vocals demonstrate
that Shane Evans can actually
understand singing. Too many
hardcore bands assume that
long notes and poor intonation.
are OK, when in fact they’re a
snooze in about two mea-
sures. Evans mixes up croon-
ing, muttering, whining and a
good hard bellow every now
and again into an interesting
vocal component.

One track that stands out is
“Old Bottles,” a lyrically brilliant
song that addresses trying to
emulate another person’s ‘cor-
rect’ thoughts: “My tongue is
always swollen from always
saying the wrong thing  I built
an antenna in my head but I
just can't seem to transmit.”
“Silver Tongue” is a nice hard
track, with dissonant flailing
guitars that cut in the middle to
a pretty bridge only to attack
again. “Behind Hand” is a
good, poppy-feeling, straighta-
head song. lts lyric
“Congratulations, you’ve suc-
ceeded again” somehow
reminds me of a game show
theme.

In sum, this album repre-
sents a band who come from a
hardcore tradition but who
have done much more than
write a few catchy moshfest
ditties. Walleye’s Familiar,
Forgotten is an album that
could equally share a place on
a shelf next to Gorilla Biscuits’
Start Today or Pavement’s
Wo_wee Zowee. So if you used
to listen to hardcore but feel
like-you ‘outgrew’ it, buy this.
Just take that silly hat with the
funny letters off before you go
into the store.

An area of zine coverage
that I have neglected thus far
is that of Internet zines.
There’re tons out there, almost
all of them free. To get a feel
for what’s available, do a
World Wide Web keyword
search for zines, or check out
alt.zines on the usenet groups.
I nearly fell out of my chair
laughing when I read
Eggman: The zine #3. Why,
you may ask? Is it as funny as
The Phoenix? Well, it’s not
really a comedy or satire zine,
so no, it’s not. A little less than
halfway in, however, I see this:
“Note to lllJOHN CIHONII!
Masturbation: has now been
mentioned.” How can I not
review it now? So, anyway,
the zine is free over e-mail but
will soon be going to print to
do a split with Disgruntl
TV#18. What’s in it? Well,
there's a lot of personal writing
and slice-of-life type stuff —
things like, being bored in
class, lots of angsting, going to
shows, personal observations,
etc. Basically, the writers are
Pitt students who don't lead
lives that are that different
from a lot of other students.
It's easy to identify. On the
minus side, a lot of the local
references would be lost on
people who have never lived
in this area. Although, if you’ve
never lived in Oakland, I don't
know what good you are any-
way. ;) Write to

Why.We Get Sick: The New
Science of Darwinian
Medicine

By Randolph M. Nesse, M.D.
and George C. Williams,
Ph.D.

Vintage Books

$13.00

In Why We Get Sick, a doc-
tor and an evolutionist team
up to explain the physiology of
illness from an evolutionary
point of view. The authors use
Darwin’s theory of natural
selection as the fundamental
basis for their ideas about the
body's susceptibility to illness.
They suggest that many of the
ways in which we deal with
pathogens in our environment
com.e from years of natural
selection for those traits which
allowed human beings to sur-
vive at all. Another idea that is
considered is the fact‘ that
some of this genetic trial-and-
error tinkering can sometimes
be detrimental .

The" most widely known
example of an evolutionary
trait which is a double-edged
sword is sickle-cell anemia.
Sickle cell anemia is a genetic
disorder that will only show up
if a person carries two genes
for the trait of abnormally
shaped red blood cells. If a
person only carries one gene,
however, they are healthy.
Why this genetic Russian
roulette developed in the first
place is because those who
carry one gene for the sickle-
cell trait have a greater resis-
tance to malaria. To have
more than one gene, then,
becomes a case of too much
of a good thing.

The authors explain other
current theories about such
maladies as morning sickness
and drug-resistant strains of
bacteria. Morning sickness,
according to the authors, is an
evolved defense by the moth-

er to prevent the fetus from
sapping too much of the moth-
er’s sustenance. The specter
of drug-resistant strains of
bacteria show the problem of
people who do not finish med-
ication and thus leave some
bacteria to survive and repro-
duce without competition from
less virulent forms of their ilk.
The book is intended to be
an introduction to the ideas of
Darwinian medicine. The
authors are careful to point out
at the beginning that they do
not want this to be a tome on
social Danrvinism, eugenics or
other attempts to misapply
evolutionary theory. Instead,
they believe that their work will
help lead to new directions in
research, therapy and health
practices. «
Although footnotes provide
ample references for their
work, the book tends to be
anecdotal, which makes it
easy for readers to understand
and fast to get through. All
areas of human health are
explored, from physical to
emotional to societal.
Randolph Nesse is a prac-
ticing physician and professor

_ of psychiatry at the University

of Michigan, and George
Williams is a professor emeri-
tus of ecology and evolution at
the State University of Stony
Brook. 30 both the field of
medicine and the field of evo-
lution are handled by qualified
individuals. .
This book is an interesting
read for those interested in
health care and evolution and

those just interested in their

own well-being. It is worth
picking up just to scan those
sections which are of interest
to you. It will provide new
ideas and ways of thinking
about why people do get sick.

The Pitt News, Thursday, February 29, 1996

.,,

Player of the Year: Ray Allen — He led the Huskies to yet

 

   

another Big East regular season crown. He was awesome. He was
clutch. He averaged 23 a game and led the conference in 3-point
shooting. He’s gonna make booty—juice out of Allen Iverson. ,
Tourney Winner: UConn — They’ve beaten everybody —— why "M
not beat everybody again? Allen and Doron Sheffer are the most -
consistent backcourt in the nation. Plus, they are surrounded by
Travis Knight, Kris King, and Rudy Johnson — all solid players. A
Mark my words, they’ll win the Big Dance, too.

" Sleeper: Pitt —— As ludicrous as it seems, this Pitt team is still tal-
Columnist ented and has the capabilities to put together a nice run. The key
will be the freshmen. Can they put their disappointing Big East bap-
tisms behind them, or will Pitt wilter down the stretch, again?

Player of the Year: Allen Iverson — He’s the creator and
dominator. His defense leads to a transition game
unequalled in the land. He leads the league in steals with
 almost four per contest, and in scoring with 23.8 points per
" game.

Tourney Winner: Connecticut —— They’re just too good.
The Huskies have the best backcourt in the Big East in Ray
Allen and Doron Sheffer, not to mention a 82-12 record the ._
last three years. Yes, that’s a winning percentage of 87 per- ;
cent.

Columnist Sleeper: Providence — They’ve come together down the _
Brad stretch like no team has in the country. They’d be ranked if it K_ev1n
Isles A weren.’t for two losses to Seton Hall. Lilley

 

 
 

7.2:

H gurus pick B. E. MVPs, Tourney champs and snoozers

Player of the Year: Allen Iverson — He’s the best player
in the nation, hands down. No one rivals him on either
end of the floor. He leads the conference in scoring (23.8)
and he’s third in the country in steals. ‘Nuff said.

Tourney Winner: "UConn — The Huskies are the only
team in the conference to ever win three consecutive Big
East regular-season titles. They have the best backcourt in
the conference and a coach who knows how to assemble a
winner. .

Sleeper: Syracuse — Unlike most years, the Orangemen

Columnist are peaking at the end of the season. All they have to do is
Sean
Duncan

get the ball to forward John Wallace and let him get his

groove on. Currently, he's the hottest player in the league.

Player of the Year: Ray Allen — The commander of
the UConn offensive attack. Allen can hit from any-
where on the court, is deadly from the charity stripe
and isn’t afraid to fight for the occasional board.
Tourney Winner: ‘Connecticut — Allen gets all the
help he needs from fellow guard Doron Sheffer and
Travis Knight, third in Big East rebounding. UConn
basketball championships — not just for women any-
more.

Sleeper: St. John’s — It's a reach, but home-Garden

‘Columnist advantage and a tune-up against the ﬂedgling Panthers
on March 2 will help.

     East Statitical Leaders

Column  
°From page 6

What rhymes with what you do on the toilet?

Yep, Pitt is the biggest disappointment in the conference. The season
started out as a fairy tale story. Fifth-year senior Jerry McCullough 
returns from a season-long knee injury to lead a talented freshman class 5 ~
into the toumament.

Not really.

Instead, McCullough fell out of favor with Ralph Willard and was
benched for two games, Kellii Taylor and Vonteego Cummings got hurt 
and the other freshmen only showed spurts of why they were a top-10 
recruiting class. i

The pressure will really be on Cummings and Co. next season to prove
they were worth the hype. ‘

Coach of the year —- Jim Boehim.

As much as I hate this guy, he did work magic in Syracuse this season. 
He took a team of which not much was expected and got 20 wins out of 
it. He’s now hit that number 19 of his 20 years at Cuse. ‘

John Wallace, who was thinking about leaving early for the pros,
decided to stay, and he has helped propel the Orange to the brink of the
top 10. '

Mark Gordon is the editor in chief0fThe Pitt News.

Turning over

One key to successful apart-
ment living is understanding
the lease. Here are some tips
from Pitt’s Commuter
Resource Center. (Any ques-
tions or problems should be
discussed with an attorney.)
The Lease Agreement

A Lease Agreement is
a contract, either written or
oral, giving you (the Tenant-
Lessee) the use of property for
a specific time (usually 6-12
months). The Lease will usu-
ally contain other conditions,
such as, who pays for utilities
or are pets and sub-letting per-
mitted. There are, of course,
many other provisions which
vary accordinig to each
Landlord’s specification.

Although the Lease
itself may be written or oral, it
should be kept in mind that
both are legally binding. It is

generally recommended that‘

you should avoid an oral lease
simply because verbal agree-
ments have a tendency to
result in misunderstandings
with you losing out in the long
run. The Lessee, therefore,
should always request a writ-
ten lease which evidences the
original agreement. pp
There are many types
of written leases. The standard
form lease, however, is a print-
ed form including the specific
major clauses that make for a
tight lease — in other words, a
legally binding contract. Most

landlords use.»-this standard A

form lease and simply print in
the blanks provided — the
landlord’s name, your name,
the amount of the security
deposit and the terms of the
lease.

_ Despite the fact that
this type of lease is formal and
binding, it has advantages to
you. It assures that the rent
can be only increased by the
conditions set forth in the
lease. Moreover, an inclusive
lease states in clear language
what conditions both the ten-
ant and the landlord must fol-
low. The written lease guaran-
tees the tenant can only be
evicted for violations speciﬁed
in the lease.

There are, of course,
disadvantages. You should be
careful and read all fine print
even if it means using a mag-
nifying glass, for many clauses
seem slanted in favor of the
landlord. One such clause
usually states that you cannot
move until the term of the
lease ends without incurring
penalties, i.e., forfeiture of
security deposit of a month’s
rent. Remember, once you
sign the lease, you are bound
by its_ conditions.

' Before signing your
lease,~you should understand
the terminology. You, the ten-
ant, are the lessee; the landord
is usually referred to as the
lessor. If the address and
phone. number of the landlord
are not included in the lease,
you should be sure to get the
information when the lease is
negotiated.

Before you sign the lease put all agreements
you reach with the landlord in the lease.

- Make note of all existing deﬁciencies and the

agreed upon remedies. Be sure you have an
exact copy signed by the landlord.

to pay a deposit to account for
any damages created by you or
your failure to pay rent. When
you enter into a lease agree-
ment, make a complete list of
all damages (even the most
minor damages) and submit
this to your landlord. Make
sure you keep a copy for your
records; The landlord must
agree to the specifics of the
damage list. If you don’t make
a list, you run the risk of even-
tually being charged for doing
that which you did not do.
Ask for assurances that the
security desposit will be
placed in escrow to guarantee
the fund will be available upon
termination of the lease.

You should always be
aware _of the duration of the
terms of the lease. Such a
clause should state when it
begins and how long it will
last. It couldbe month to

month, year to year, or simply
a “school-year” lease.

A month—to-month
lease usually gives you rights
to the apartment for 30 days
and is renewed each month by
continued occupancy. A 30-
day notice is required prior to

termination. The year-to-year‘

lease, on the other hand, oblig-
ates the tenant and landlord for
one calendar year and rent is
usually paid in monthly install-
ments, The tenant should be
aware that continued occupan-
cy, even for only a few days
past the termination date, may
obligate the tenant to an addi-
tional year’s rent payment.
The school-year leases are the
same except the tenant and
landlord are only obligated for
9 months or the length of the
school year.

A tenant should aways

._ be careful that the lease states

the amount of money due, and
when payment should be
made. Without a rent amount
in the agreement the tenant
may be faced with the land-
lord’s attempts to unjustly
increase’ payment.
Furthermore, the ten-
ant should be careful to note
any penalties which the lease
may contain for late payment.

Some standard leases will per-.

mit the landlord to demand the
entire amount due, i.e., the
number of months remaining,
as an assurance for the late
payment. Such a clause is
known as a rent acceleration
clause.

Generally, unless a
lease provides otherwise, the
landlord may enter your prop-
erty to inspect or make repairs.
A time and date arrangement
between you and your landlord

method. Your landlord may
only inspect and make repairs
at reasonable times.

Sublet means to lease
or rent all or part of a leased or
rented property to another per-
son.

Assignment means _

transfer of property.

The tenant should
make sure to understand these
conditions. Many leases limit
the tenant to use the property
only as a residence.
Restrictions on either sub-let-
ting or assignments are
enforceable by the landlord. If
nothing in the lease prohibits

you from sub-letting or assign- ' "

ing the lease you may do so.
Since many rentals to
tenants are for less than three
years, you should read the ter-
mination and renewal clause.
This clause is found near the
end of the lease and it states
how the lease is to be ended or
renewed. A tenant is advised
to read the lease and make sure
any method of termination
provided for in the lease is
acceptable. Some leases have
an automatic renewal clause.
In other words, the lease auto-
matically renews for another
term, under the same rent and
conditions, if the landlord or

tenant do not give notice of . .

termination.

When dealing with
rent payments, you should be
extra cautious and always pay

by c-heck or demand a -receipt. v

If after reading this
you think all bases have been
covered and you are ready to
sign —”WAIT”. A tenant
should not sign unless he first
inspects the property and
clearly understands the lease.
If the tenant cannot understand
or the landlord cannot explain
any part of the lease, it should
be immediately deleted. Have
it crossed out and signed by
the landlord, even if the land-
lord indicates it is unimportant
and won’t be used.

Although we indicated
earlier that a verbal contract is
enforceable, a landlord’s ver-
balpromises to make repairs
are difficult to enforce. The
tenant should write “THIS
PAYMENT OF RENT IS
SUBJECT TO THE
REPAIR...” then, make a list

of the repairs to be made. .

WRITE IT - DON'T SAY IT.
In Pennsylvania, verbal
promises made when there is a
written lease are not admiss-
able in court. You should
never sign a written lease that
does not include the landlord’s
verbal promises in writing.
Once the tenant signs the

lease, the landlord and tenant .

each get a copy and both
copies should be exactly the
same.

In spite of these disad-
vantages and even if a tenant

‘signs a lease with unfavorable

clauses, you should not feel all
is lost. Not all of these clauses
are enforceable and not all ten-
ants rights are spelled out in
the leases. When in doubt,
