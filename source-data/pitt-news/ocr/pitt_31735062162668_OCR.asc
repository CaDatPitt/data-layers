THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Chancellor Reveals
 New Fine Arts Plan

Building to Include Galleries, Henry F rick

 Fine Arts Library, Studios and Classrooms

V Plans for a new building to house the university’s Fine.
Arts Department have been announced by Chancellor Litch-

ﬁeld.

‘He said the building, to be some 50,000 square feet in
area, will be designed to house galleries, class rooms, studios,
oiﬁces and the Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts Libr/ary.

The announcement was made att

the opening of an exhibition of
the Nicholas Lochoff ‘collection, of
reconstructions of Italian master-

Wpieces, last Wednesday.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld said, “This
new building will beneﬁt not only

. the university‘ but the Pittsburgh-

area as well. It will make pos-
sible further improvements in an
already excellent ﬁne arts pro-
gram for- the students. The com-
munity will gain because it will
constitute an important addition

‘to the area’s cultural resources.”

Planned in Italian Style
Preliminary plans call for a
building constructedin the tradi.-'

.unique feature is an arrangement
‘of two small courts whereyfres-
coes and sculpture may‘ be dis-
played. A
The largest single section of
the building will -house the Hen-'
ry Clay Frick Fine Arts Library
which has long been recognized
as one of the outstanding collec-“
tions of its type in this country.
Now located on the 7th. floor

-.'.,CL,' it contains some 27,500 vol-

umes as well as“numerous— per-
iodicals, over 60,000 photographs,
23,000 slides and ‘many facsimilies
of drawings. There is also a nu-
cleus of a permanent collection of
ﬁne prints, sculpture,. painting
and the decorative arts. '
Gallery Space Enlarged
Discussing the new building,
Professor Walter'R. I-lovey, head
of the Fine Arts Department’ said,
“The Fine Arts Department is
especiallygknown in the city ‘for
its distinguished series of small

W loan exhibitions now held in its

seventh floor gallery.

“Because of the new building,
our gallery space will be increas-
ed vastly and the accessibility of
the exhibitions to. the public will
be improved greatly. It is hoped
that in time a small permanent
collection of original art objects
to illustrate the history of the
arts may be established.”

Law School Post
Fellow

Dean Thomas M. Cooley an-
nounced recently the appointment
of Arthur H. Kahn as assistant
professor in the university Law
School.

For the past academic year Pro-
fessor Kahn ‘has been a Sterling
Fellow at Yale Law School, where
he was engaged in research. Dur-
ing 1958, he was acting assistant
to the dean and assistant profes-
sor of law at Rutgers School of

.~vYLaw. It was there that he receiv-

led his bachelor of law degree.

Security Funds
Needed Before

Libraries Open

The university libraries will not
open on Sundays until the secur-
ity police department ﬁnds
enough money to pay the extra
policemen who will be required
to be on duty.

‘Capt. Charles Ray, head of the
department," said 'that;his budget
does not provide for additional
funds necessary to supply the
men. Capt. Ray is concerned
about the source, of these funds
although he favors the opening of

the libraries on Sundays.

4 “I_ think that the university li-
brary shouldbe open on Sundays
because I think that it is a shame
to‘ let the ﬁne facilities we have
here g.o.to waste,” Ray stated.
According to Capt. Ray, it
would cost several hundred dol-
lars per ﬁscal year over and
above his present budget to keep

SOME OF the works of the Nicholas Lochoffcollection was the S

topic ‘of discussion at‘ the donation of the paintings among Chan-
. cellor and Mrs. Litchﬁeldand "Walter, Read Hovey, right, head
or the department of‘ ﬁne_ arts here. Above them is one of the
works, originally done by man Italian Renaissance artist.’ The col-
lection, presented last Wednesday night in the Commons Room,

is a gift of Helen C. Frick.

MC Tentatively Accepts

Men’s Court Proposals

A tentative Men’s Court has been accepted by Men’s ‘

Council. The Court is a part of the entire student govern-

ment judiciary system.

Five proposals, listed in areporj; given by Chief Justice
Herb Dodell at last Tuesday’s meeting, are included in the
set-up. First, Men’s Court will consist of ﬁve permanent rep-

resentatives chosen by the ex-¢_

ecutive committee from a list of
applications _ submitted by the
student body.

Next the Court will make de-
cisions paretining to men on mat-

- ters referred to the court by In-

terfraternity Council and resi-
dence hall judiciary bodies.

Work With 'Police

Third, the. Court, will work in-

conjunction with the university
police on matters of traffic and
parking violations. The Court also
will levy and collect ﬁnes ‘as
necessary to enforce these rules.

Fourth, Men’s Court will hear
cases in which male students
are involved in cheating, elec-
tion frauds and social code vio-
lations. These cases will be
brought before the court only
after the lower judiciary com-
mittees have failed to settle the

 

"...-W¢°'‘s»'’. - “

Men's Council will set up a’sys-
tem of penalties and ﬁnes for the

.most common violations of good

behavior. With the aid of- the uni-
versity administration, the court
will. establish rules enforcing
these penalties within the frame-
work of sound student govern-
ment practices.
Who Sells Blazers?

Another matter that was dis-
cussed at last Week’s Council
meeting was the blazer situation.
MC previously announced that
Marvin’s men’s store would be the

sole distributor for the Pitt jack- __

ets.

However, it was later learned
that Leftee’s in downtown Pitts-
burgh still has 50 to 75 blazers
on sale. L_eftee’s carried the
blazers ‘last year. Marvin’s is

. scheduled to receive an order of.
the next two .-

George Walter
Elected ‘Mayor
Of   . Johnstown

Dr. George Walter, associate
professor of sociology at the Uni-
versity’s Johnstown College, has
been elected mayor of the city of
Johnstown.

Dr. VV alter, returning on the
Democratic ticket, defeated his
R e p u b l i c a n opponent, Daniel
Shields, in last Tuesday’s election.
_Shields_ was formerly mayor of
Johnstown and
member of the City Council.

The new mayor has been presi-
dent of the Johnstown School
Board the past 18 months. He had
no other previous political back-
ground.

The Johnstown student body
played Dr. Walter's victory up
big Wednesday morning. The
students of his 9:30 a.m. class
had a chauifeured-Cadillac take
him from his home to school, led
by policemen on siren-scream-
ing motorcycles. Then the entire
college personnel honored May-
or Walter at a special assembly
later that morning.

Mayor Walter has been at

, Johnstown College for 12 years.

He was graduated‘ from Juniata
College and received Master’s

Spring Festival

By HARRY LEWINTER S a

Student Government Assn.
will decide the fate of Spring
Festival this afternoon. The
Appointments Committee of
SGA, which has been consid-
ering the future of the “car-
nival,” will reccommend to the
body that Spring Festival, _in its
present form, should be abolis‘.-.-

ed. The SGA meeting will start
at 3 p.m. in 319 SU.

This recommendation is the re-
sult of several discussions and
meetings conducted by SGA in an
effort to determine if students
really want a Spring Festival.
From the apathetic turnout exhi-
mited at a discussion held Sept.
30, the disinterest was evident,
according to SGA members.

Kent Jarrell, president of

SGA, was present at that meet-'

ing and commented, “Ifthere

were only three people (out of

visualize a continuance of Spring
Carnival in its present form, I

Spring Carnival will be dropped
or radically changed." V .
In a recent interview Jarrell
stated, “Once this problem is out
of the ‘way. the Appointments
Committee‘ can concentrate on
making new,’ constructive propos-
als as to what kind of activities
should be held in the spring.”.
Several suggestions were
brought to the attention of the

by Dave Menzer, Arts ’62.
Menzer cited three reasons
for not continuing Spring Car-
nival: the ﬁnancial burden in-
curred, the time involved and
the fact that in the past Spring
C a rni v a] has. been directed
mainly toward fraternity and-
sorority participation. ~ —
The proposal designated’ a
week’s activities, called a Pitt-O-
Rama, that he said, would be di-
rected toward the individual and
would prove of interest to a -larg-
er percentage of the university
community.

Midday Series  
Slates Werner

“The German Theatre from
Schiller to‘ the Present Day” will
"be discussed by Dr. Bruno Wer-
ner on Wednesday's Midday Pro-
gram in the SU ballroom.

Born in Leipzig, Werner has
the distinction of being an author,
educator, dramatist, and scholar.
Since 1925, he has been a literary

and cultural editor. of a well
known Berlin newspaper.

After serving as an oificer in
the ﬁrst world war, he studied
at the universities of Munich and
Berlin. He was one of the foun-
ders of the‘ Northwest German
Radio and was head of its cultural
section.

Speaking before the entire stu— 
dent engineering body, Simpson 
advised them to “avoid specializa- 
tion” and “stay close to the funda- V;-;
mentals” in their undergraduate 
years if they intend to enter these 
new fields of science, i l;
The talk, presented as the Dr. 
Samuel P. Langley Memorial Lec— ,-_3_
ture, was entitled “Space Age and

diploma was 20 years ago.”

The “measure of success” is not
necessarily limited to a senior
management position in a large
organization, said Simpson. “Re-
spect in his profession and among
his colleagues is one measure” of
achievement for the scientist and
engineer. .

Producer Overlooked

the movie industry, be illustrated
that the laurels and pay come to
the stars rather than to the pro-

the technical organizations of the

.future. Success will be measured

more in terms
achievement.”

After working with the young
scientists and engineers in this
country, Simpson disagrees with
“many pessimistic predictions”
which are based upon the belief
that the U. S. is falling behind
in its technical potential.

“They are capable and want to
work on the toughest technical
problems. They don’t want the
soft jobs. In the years ahead our
advanced technical program will
fall into these hands and there
will be sustained progress and ac-
complishments.”

One of the advances predicted
by Simpson is the use of nuclear
energy for rocket propulsion with-
in the next ten years.

front or in back of someone that
had an umbrella, then this,any-
one could put a newspaper over

I do not mind people that try
to keep dry — far be it from me
to moan at thesepeople -— but

'when I get __wet so other people

can keep dry I feel slightly pe_1‘-
turbed because this is an in-
fringement on my rights.-

If you haven’t already surmis-

ed as much, I was the guy in _

the Stadium Saturday who pro-
tested vociferously about um-
brellas and protested up a fight.
Incidentally, this battle remains
to be settled in some manner.
If the gentleman who insisted

range to “negotiate” in the Sta-

If this defender of public
rights ‘ for umbrella‘ carriers
needs an audience, ‘Which he
seemed to need Saturday, then

‘his fraternity brothers are in-

vited to the “negotiations.” Per-

ments at one time. _

These “negotiations” should
not last for more than a few
weeks since there is very likely

Standards Send 1
Best Areq Players
TO Other Places

By LARRY HAGGERTY

As the football season goes into its ninth week of action, it hon-
estly can‘ be said that the Panthers have been somewhat of a dis-

A « appointment so far. Actually, however, they are only one game be-

.hind their pre-season victory forecast.
The Jungle Cats have broken even in their eight contests to

_date. The only difference from the pre-season survey has been the

fact that the Panthers dropped a 23-15 decision to West Virginia.

it But as Mountaineer; Coach Pappy Lewis stated after the game, ‘‘I

doubt if any team in the country could have beaten us today be-

_ cause we were so ﬁred up and rarin’ to beat Pitt."

Let’s take a close look at the 1959 season in regards ‘to Pitt’s

.' gridiron situation. A Panther alumnus very close to the; football
scene recently commented, and we are prone to agree with him, “Most
. of the blame for the poor showing should be placed where it actually

belongs-—right on the shoulders of Chancellor Litchfield ‘and his staff.”
We cannot. however. try to cover up for Michelosen and
his coaching staff for there is no reasonable excuse not to get the
best out of the material present. Mike and his aides without a
doubt must take the rap for the poor showings against Marquette
and West Virginia. The Panthers should be able to name the «score
against this type. of opposition. but upsets do happen I quess.
But at the same time, nearly everyone in the Tri-State area be-
lieves that Pitt has the greatest wealthlof football talent in America.

1 ‘Nearly all the Stadium quarterbacks who show up each Saturday

afternoon seem to wonder out_loud whyEMichelosen doesn’t win every

game with a crop of outstanding gridders such as those enrolled at
 Skyscraper U. But that’s a myth that somebory should try to put to

rest very quickly.

The truth of the matter is obvious. Michelosen just isn't getting
his share of the really good players from the Tri-State area. Instead
the local schoolboy stars are enrolling at colleges like Penn State,
Purdue, Indiana, Duke, Clemson, Miami or Florida, Michigan. State,

-, Notre Dame, Army, Navy, Arizona State and many other institutions ‘
, along the big time football trail.

Just why the Blue and Gold is ﬁghting a losing cause in re-
cruiting football talen also appears to be quite evident as we see,
it. Stiff educational standards established by the Chancellor have
kept numerous local athletes from enrolling at Pitt.

Though all talk of de-emphasis is usually denied, such policy is
doing nothing else than helping to deﬂate the sport and lower the

caliber of football in a round-aboutmanner. “But whytworry about

it?" one Panther follower asked. “A_ school ‘establishes standards and
that’s it. The Cathedral of Learning won’t_collapse just because the
Panthers have a badseason or two."

An out-manned football squad will no doubt thing that the Ca-
thedral is falling on them just asvheavily when the nation's gridiron
powers get through with the slaughter. And t_he worst part of the mat-
ter is that Michelosen will have to bear the brunt of the burden sim-

M ply because he doesn't have the horses for the course. .

The ridiculous side of the whole situation is that the Panthers
are establishing Ivy League admission standards but are schedul-
ing‘ the nation’s—best teams as future foes. Thus it is almost crim-
inal to compare the Jungle Cats with the likes of Syracuse, Penn
State. Michigan-State, Notre Dame, Oklahoma. TCU, USC, etc.

_ It just cannot be done under the present recruiting policies. The
Panthers might be able to hold their own with a schedule something
like those Penn State, Syracuse and West Virginia play, but an Ivy
League card would appear to be, more in order under the new setup
established by Dr. Litchfie1d’s ideas and his assistants;

"We argree with the,Chancel1or’s ideas to provide the best possible
education for the students at Pitt, but he should realize that he can’t

. eat his cake and have his football compete on a ‘national level also.

Darkness Steals Victory.
Cat Booters Tied
In Final Seconds

By JACK SNIITH
With 34 seconds left in the game and a ﬁeldso covered
by darkness and mudthat one couldn’t see the players, let

 

' alone the ball, Army managed to tally a last minute goal to

tie the Panther Booters, 2-2, last Friday at West Point.
Due to the darkness, defensive signal got mixed upand
on a shot by a cardet, Fullback Call Smith and Goalie Keek

Zanicopoulos collided causing thc¢

ball to bounce free. A cadet line-
man took advantage of the mis-
take and scored the goal to tie
the game. '

Amy took the ‘lead _in the ﬁrst
quarter when, with 4.55 seconds
left, Zanicopoulos went out to
cover the ball, it sprung loose near

.the goal and was pushed in by

\

Army’s Dave Hogarth.
' Panthers Score
The Panthers came back in the
third quarter to tie the game. Tom
Young, righthalf,»had been work-
ing the ball to linemen Bob Mur-
doch and Bob McNulty who were
trying to move the ball down the
outside. But a pass got 1oose'up
the center of the field and Center-
Forward .Ed Weihrauch broke
ahead of the defense. .
Weihrauch dribbled the ball
toward the goal having only the
goalie to get by, faked him off
balance, and quickly shot the
ball into the net.
In the fourth quarter the Cats
‘went out in front» when Simeon

Pestich passed. to Don Jerich who '

shot the ball from about 15 yards
out. The ball, however, had so
much spin on it that when the
‘goalie went to pick it up‘ it spun
out of his hands into the net.
Fine Footwork

“It’s rough to only come home,
, with a tie,”

stated coach Leo
Bemis. “I believe‘-if it hadn’t been
for the darkness and the fact that
we were unable to play an over-
time, we might have won.” .

I With just two weeks remaining
in the Yogi contest it looks like

Larry I-Iaggerty has gone into high ‘

starts to pull away from the pack. .

The player is still hanging in

by Haggerty if the player is to

‘Ted Colton,‘ once proud leader
in the race, keeps falling down.
The big‘ drop by Colton can pro-

Booters Make Mistake .
Although Army_outshot the Pan-
thers, the Cats still managed to
control the ball throughout most
of the game.

The Booters did make the
mistake of holding the ball too
long. on passes, thus missing

cmany opportunites to break the
‘game open.‘

 

   

By DAVE LEVINE
Panther Captain Ron Rush
ran second to Frank Levin‘ of
NYU. as the Cats bowed to

the New Yorkers, 22-36.

The ‘first three harriers to
cross the ﬁnish line broke the
old record set by Bush just two
weeks ago. Levin covered the 4.3
mile Schenley Park course in
22:07.9, bettering the_record by
50.1 seconds. Rush negotiated the
run in 22:35, and Jim Brown of
N.Y.U. went the distance in 22:48.

An unusually fast pace was set
by both teams and Panther Coach
Carl Rees commented ‘that, “Ev-
ery one of our fellows ran faster
than ever before but it just wasn’t
enough.”

Levin, Rush and Brown ran to-
gether for the ﬁrst 3 miles. At
about the .3:5 mark, Rush and
Levin pulled ahead of Brown. Al-
most immediately Levin moved in
front of Rush and wound up win-
ning by about-150 yards.

Levinpis without a doubt the
finest runner the Blue and Gold

Sunday Library Hours:

Security Funds Needed
(Continued from Page 1)
the libraries open each Sunday
from 2 to 5 p.m. as present plans

call for.

At this time Ray is considering
hiring student policemen for the
security job. This would cut
down the costs by 75 per cent,
he said, since ‘student employees
would make that much less than
regular policemen.

Lorena Garloch, head librarian,
revealed the plans for the librar-
ies opening on Sundays, last week
at the meeting of S.G.A. At that
time she said the cost to the li-

brary would be $l5 per Sunday.

When. the new plan goes into
effect, students will have to show
their ID cards in order to, use the
facilities.
