City, County Plan
 Bowl Tax Verdict
A ‘Within Ten Days’

l Proposed $60,000 Annual Stadium
Levy To Be Decided Soon,
Say Williams, Rae

By Roman Lapica

$7,500 a day.

This might be the estimated
value of each of the remaining
eight days before the University
learns whether or not it must"pay
the $60,000 yearly tax the city
a.nd county are jointly attempting
to slap on the stadium,

Final decision on the city’s attempt
to collect its $46,000 share will be
announced “within ten days,” City
Assessor Perry R. VVilliams told a
Pitt News representative Monday.

The county setting the tax on the
stadium at about $13,000———a1so will
announce its decision “shortly,” said
James Rae, secretary of the county
board for the assessment and revi-
sion of taxes.

Both city and county—-working in-
dependently of each other—seek to
det_e1-‘mine whether the stadium is or-
ganized as a “corporation” command
ing a yearly proﬁt or whether it is a
“necessity.”

John Wfeber, business manager for
the University, in a letter read at
hearings of the county tax board Mon-
day,-announced that the stadium in
its nine _vea.rs of use shows a total
deﬁcit of $535,944.

The average deﬁcit for one year
was estimated at $59,549.

Although ﬁgures have not yet been
released, Mr. Vi-’eber was certain the
stadium would show a ,de_ﬁeit this
year. , ' '

Charles F. C. Arensberg, attorney
for the University, declared that any
attempt to tax the stadium would be
fought in the courts. -

“VVe have no desire to tax unjustly
an educational institution which after
all is of Value to both city and coun-
ty,”  Rae said. “We want only to
determine whether it makes a proﬁt
a.nd whether it is necessary to the in-
stitution. If we decided it is unneces-
sary, it must pay the tax.”

“VVhether’it makes a proﬁt or not,
the stadium must pay if we decide it
is unnecessary to the educational life
of Pitt." declared Mr. ‘Williams.

Mr. Vvilliams asserted both investi-
gations were being conducted “entire-
ly” independent of each other.

Previously downtown papers esti-
mated the total proposed tax as more
than $30,000. According to the city
assessor, a $23,500 tax by the school
board had not been added. The value
of the land was also underestimated.

At the hearing T. S. Rupp, Univer-
sity auditor, announced a gross in-
come of $3,285,920 since 1925. The
largest single 0 item’ contributing to
the deﬁcit was the $1,020,882 paid vis-
iting teams. \

It was announced the University
received less than the visiting team
in all but the \V& J and Tech games
this year.

Dr. Williams To Speak

Dr, S. H. Vvilliams, professor of
zoology, will speak at Brockway High
school in Jefferson county (Friday
afternoon on “Looking forward to col-
-lege.” In the evening he will tell the
Rotary club in Dubois county of his
jungle explorations in South America.
That night he will address Clearﬁeld
county sportsmen on “Conservation in
Pennsylvania.”

The first non-fraternity president of

“Druids hasn’t done anything since

Va.n Ormer was first threatened with
impeachment proceedings earlier in
the semester when he intimated that
changes in appointed positions would
be made.‘ The charges brought Sun-
day closely followed his request for
the resignation of Richard Hermes,
C37, Phi Kappa, as social chairman,
after Hermes’ work on today’s Gwen-

Cromie To Speak
At Inquiry Today

Intercollegiate Council Oﬂicer To
Make Second Address Here

 

Leonard J. Cromie, ‘traveling secre-
tary for the Intercollegiate council,
will be the speaker at the weekly
meeting of Inquiry forum in Room 107,
Alumni hall, today. Mr. Cromie will
discuss “luropean youth, actor or
specta‘tor?"’_

Mr. Cromie spoke- before the inter-
national relations club Monday on the
League of Nations, discussing its po-
sition in world affairs and the atti-
tude of the United States in regard
to the League. He characterized the
League as “one of the last hopes for
international sanity” and said, “De—
spite the fact Germany and Japan
have withdrawn from it, their loss
has been more than compensated by
the entrance of Russia.”

Commenting on the attitude of the
United States in regard to the
League, Mr. Cromie said:

“The chief objection to the entrance
of the United States is that. it is an
opportunity for political maneuvering,
and that this country should 11ot en-
ter into political alliances which will
eventually lead to war.

“However, the neutrality of our na-
tion is respected, throughout the
world Our entrance would be of the
utmost help in the settlement of dis-
putes, and we could stop the use of
the League as a tool for national in-
terests.”

nouncement today by W’. W. M.,e11den-

The topic for the address is, “The
economic reasons for race prejudice.”

A nationally known leader of his
race, Mr. ‘Pickens has had.-.wide ex-.
perience in tense racial situations in-
volving negroes, especially in the now-
famous Scottsboro case in Alabama.
He is a graduate of Harvard univer-

Third Hour Classes Dismissed
For Memorial Hall Lecture
By Polar Pioneer

 

 

By Marjorie Reich

Some old ideas will be exploded
this -morning when Vilhja.-lmur
Stefansson addresses students and
faculty members in a. general as-
sembly-'at 10:30 o’clock in Memo-
rial hall. He is going to prove
that the “frozen North” isn’t
frozen, and that the Actic in which
he -has spent his life exploring, is
ready to be opened up and civilized.

Stefansson has given as his subject
i'or today’s lectur_e "The northward
course of empire,” and will consider

, historically how we came to be obese-

ed with strange ideas about the Far
North which are only now dying out.
He will show how these conceptions
have come to us from the Greeks and
will trace the inﬂuences which have
caused the gradual breakdown of the
Greek theory of a lifeless Arctic. The
explo_rer_ and scientist will trace the
uninterrupted spread of civilization
northward from its cradle in" ‘the
tropics, and will show why that north-
ward trend will not stop until the
Arctic is opened up and developed.

He will conclude his lecture by
pointing out the lines along which
that development may proceed, dwell-
ing particularly on the coming trans-
polar commerce by air.

Harvard to the Arctic

Stefansson was born in Manitoba.
His parents pioneered b.oth in Canada
and the Dakotas. He attended the
University of North Dakota and _Was
graduated from the University“" of
Iowa, A year in the Harvard Divinity
school ended his academic career, and
since that time he has devoted his life
to explorations in the Arctic.

He has already added 100,000
square miles to the maps of the ter-
ritory of that region.

In America and Canada he was the
one who awakened an interest for
modern ethnography in the Arctic re-
gions. He is considered the greatest
living authority on the Eskimos, their
language and habits of living, being
the first explorer born outside of the
Arctic to get‘ a ready command of the
Eskimo language. He rediscovered
forgotten Canadian Eskimo tribes,
discovered others, and opened up the
whole district of the Northwest pass-
age to the initiative of the white man.

Arctic Air Stations

The attention of the whole world
was drawn to the Arctic countries
when he removed the fallacies that
surrounded them and described their
real as opposed to their assumed cli-
mate and resources. Steiansson is
the ﬁrst to point out the importance
of Arctic countries as stations in the
time to come when airplanes and air-
ships are expected to revolutionize
the traffic of the world. _

All third hour classes will be omit-
ted to provide time for the lecture.

Tax.-Free Properties

A taxes it levies on real estate,
the City of Pittsburgh suggests
adﬁiesus ‘U..niversity — through
the stadium——to its list of taxable
properties.

The County of Allegheny, turn-
ing a moment from its favorite
project of laying tolls on the Lib-
erty Tubes, announces that there
may be county taxes too.

A decision is expected within
ten days on the basis of discover-
ing whether the stadium is a
“necessity. ’ ’

If the tax is levied, it will be
impossible for the University to
avoid it by the means so many
industrial plants .. formerly. of
Pittsburgh have used in the last
15 years. The University will not
move up the Monongahela. nor
down the Ohio. In the Cathedral,
above all, the University has
given hostage to the community
it ‘serves.  it i “I '

Yet the complications that mu-
nicipal and county authorities
would give rise .to, should they
commence assessing taxes upon
the basis of the “necessity” of;
tax-free properties may give them
pause.

How many of its several hun-
dred churches would the City ﬁnd
“neccssary‘.?” And how many of
the community houses and recrea- 
tional centers attached to the‘
churches are a “necessity?”

How “necessary” is the Phipps
Conservatory?

Does the principle of “neces-
sity” apply togcommercial prop-
erty, say to theunoccupied upper
reaches of Pittsburgh skyscrap-
ers? 0

There was a time, we believe.
when each of these properties was
unnecessary. But time has justi-
ﬁed the Phipps Conservatory,
most of the churches probably,
the community houses and the
recreational centers. There were;
a. few days in the fall of 1925, fo1- 
lowing Lafayette college’s defeat‘
of the University in the stadium,
when the stadium seemed to have
been a.n unnecessary mistake. But
the dark thought passed. As a
mass recreation for thousands of
urban university stndents——as
well as for other citizens, both
older and younger—the stadium
has become “necessary.”

Phi Beta Kappa Speaking
POSSIBLE USE for Phi Beta
Kappa men and women ap-

pears in the recentcode outlined
by Dr. Harry Emers.o:I1 Fosdick,
former president of Phi Beta
Kappa alumni in New York, who
urges that college groups “in-
stead of being purely ornamental,
should take their supposed intel-
lectual ascendency in earnest and
do something to awaken thought
and stimulate discussion in their
connnunities. ’ ’

Students who wear the gold key
at Hobart college have been the
ﬁrst, apparently, to try out the
new policy of the scholastic fra-
ternity. “Is war a live issue?”
one senior is asking in a tour of
New York, and other
speeches and other speakers a.re
in preparation.

\Ve have always admired the
pure ornamental qualities of the
lilies of the ﬁeld, that simply sat
all day and deﬁed___competition.
But perhaps the purely ornament-
al phase of college honoraries is
passing out.

A Druidical Right

HE TIME HAS COME, as the
\Valrus said, to talk about
Druids again.

This time Druids is getting it-
self talked about by having voted
on impeachment measures against
its president, charging the admin-
istrafion with having “done noth-
ing.”

‘Whereas it has always been the
ancient privilege of honorarics to
do nothing, we suggest that the
impeachment commendably failed.

Should either the a.dmini.stra-
tion or the minority bloc in
Druids conceive a plan of action
that would beneﬁt the University
generally, however, or if the ad-
ininistration and membership of
Druids —— working together -
should conceive such a plan. we
shall be happy to lead the cheer-
mg.

Audience Beams

At Pittsburgh Playhouse Premiere

By Herrymon Maurer

The chill weather of Monday night

did not prevent the Comic Muse from

smiling benignly upon the ﬁrst production of the new Pittsburgh Playhouse,
“Art and Mrs. Bottle,” by Benn W. Levy. Perhaps at times the smile was a
little forced. Certainly, however, throughout almost the whole play the muse

smiled willingly. So did the audience.

The audience was appreciative both

of the play and of the handling of it. The attendance was good.
The story of “Art. and Mrs. Bottle," in brief, is that of a woman who de-
serted lici family, and who returns to¢

it after eighteen years. The youngi
members of the family are interested]
in 3l‘l3- They are interested in love.l
Mother, however, impresses upon thei
children the utilitarian virtues, in'
which experience has taught her to
believe. Finally both art and love are
deserted. '

The author seems to waver between

two extremes: the one extreme of artl

for art's sake, and love for 1ove’s sakeé
——-an extreme represented by the}
character of Max Lightly and by the}
aspirations of the children; and the;
other extreme of practicality——a prac-i
ticality almost absolute. Mr. Levyl
himself prefers the practical.— He does!
not mince words about art, however
much he may poke fun at the utili-1,
tarianism of Mr. and Mrs. Bottle. E

‘Art Is Backwater’ i

Activities of life other than those:
artistic and romantic, Mr. Levy,i
through the words of Mrs. -Bottle, pro-E
claims to be moral. Art is art, noth-E;
ing -else. It is the backwater; the;
backwater is stagnant even if at some
places it touches the main stream;§
and the actions of artists are like the:
actions of contortionists. In contrast:
to the worthlessness of art, there is.
the practical. “A sewer is the noblest?
work of man, and a sanitary engineer;
is the noblest work of God.” M12;
Bottle, be it said, is appropriately a‘
sanitary engineer himself. 

The house of Bottle is something off
a mad house. Mr. Bottle suggests;
Shaw's very much distressed l\/la.ngan,:
although Levy's treatment is more;
gentle. ilalculating dialogue andf
characters cool in their thrusts and§
parries give an air of mad abnormal-E

ity, trying to excuse its existence.
With such dialogue and such char-
acters it is impossible that the play
drag. Levy approaches on occasion
the brilliance of the conversation of
. a Meredith or the dialogue of a Shaw.

l

‘Occasionally, however, his epigrams ~

,seem forced; occasionally they seem
ltoo consciously inserted. And some-
times the comedy loses its relation to
t.he pla_v’s purpose and is pure fun and
burlesque.

Levy Leans Too Far
There is in “Art and Mrs. Bottle,” a

certain lack of clarity. The play-
wright’s position is not clearly de-
ﬁned. Perhaps the farmer Charlie
Dawes represents the suitable mean.
We see all too little of him. Nonethe-
less, Mr, Levy leans hopefully toward
the practical. He leans too far. Much
of his attack on art-for-art's sake is
justiﬁed; yet he dismisses all artistic
endeavor because the art of the time
is stagnant.
manifesto; a sanitary engineer is not
a seer. Faith in them may be false.
It may be, however, that Mr. Levy is
simply reporting a condition and de-
pends on his report to stir thought.

“Art and Mrs. Bottle” does stir
thought, I felt, and if you see the

play you will feel too, that the play
is a pla.y to remember.

The acting of the play was C0l’ll-
petent. The performance of Betty
Quarrie as Sonia Tinpett, and that of
Marx Hartman as Charlie Dawes was
especially good. The settings, for
which Frank Stout was responsible,
were excellent. The Playhouse made
a good start Monday.

Banks Admires
Father Coughiin
F or Social Views

By Edwin P. Banks

HE MORE I listen to Father

Coughlin, and our radio is faith-
fully dialed to his broadcast every‘
Sunday afternoon, the more I grow
to like the man. VVhen he ﬁrst began
his air orations a couple of years ago,
I resented his ranting interruption of
the Philharmonic symphony pro-
gram; now, however, I ﬁnd myself
following his words with considerable
interest.

Old Style Speaker

The radio priest speaks in 9. man-
ner that is still dlspleasing. He has
not yet outgrown his highly artiﬁcial‘
style of presenting his material. He
is fond of employing all the rhetorical
affectations of the old school of public
speaking. He whispers; he shouts;
he tortures -sobs into his phrases; he
pauses dramatically. He
elaborate ﬁgures of speech that blos-
som li-ke g-au,d_y._ﬂower.S.
_,and . ‘.‘unq110teS-” He
harsh» _sarc.asm.

The Father is probably proud of his
delivery and might continue to use it
no matter what class of people he
thought he was addressing. But the
fact may be that the great mass of his
listeners——1aborers, clerks, and others
dissatisﬁed with the present economic
order—-like that type of speaking. And
if they do, Coughlin can be excused
his ﬂourishes.

Far more important than how the
priest says his say is what he has to
say. -Coughlin is saying plenty. He
is attacking predatory capitalism and
its, exponents, and he has authorita-
tive evidence to back his assertions

Value Of Iconoclasm

Iconoclasm has its place in social
‘comment’. *‘VVe can well hearken to
our Menckens who poke their ﬁngers
so gleefully into our political and su-
perstitious bubbles. But we naturally
follow more -seriously the critics of
"our ‘institutions who have deﬁnite
constructive measures to offer.

Coughlin, belongs to the latter group.
The reform he is advocating, while they
do not bear the stamp of originality,
have the merit of being supported to
a considerable degree by liberal
economists, political scientists, and
business men. ~Na.tionalization of the
banking system has been proposed by
several able thinkers of our day;
Saint Franklin himself has revealed
his sympathies for public ownership
of utilities, and none but the gentle-
men who dislike paying their income
tax oppose a permanent public -works
program. 4 _, K
‘Bolshevtst In Disguise’

To sidestep accusations that he is
“unamerican,” a “foe of the Consti-
tution,” and a “Bolshevik in disguise,”
the radio priest has cleverly bolster-
ed his economic principles by quota-
tions from early American patriots,
like Jefferson; and from the Declara-
tion of Independence and the Consti-
tution itself; similarly, he has ex-
pressed vigorous repugnance for the
doctrines of Communism. To prove
that he is not un-Catholic, he has
quoted freely from encyclicals of the
Pope, which indicate that he is only
carrying out orders when he speaks
on political questions.

It is to Cougl1lin's credit also that
he has shown the courage to denounce
noted Catholics like Al Smith and
John J'_ Raskob. It is amazing that
the Detroit priest has had the audacity
to challenge openly Cardinal McCon-
nell’s charges against him. Cough1in’s
Irish blood has not ﬂowed sluggishly
through his veins.

So I have revised my attitude to-
ward Father Coughlin. Let him con-
tinue his swashbuckling microphone
manner if he wants to. As long as he
keeps up the brave ﬁght for what he
believes is social justice, more power
to him.

Quite Snappy

An editorial in the Daily Kansan
ﬂays the modern campus dance as
“barbaric.” The editorial states, “No
savage tribe ever used the dance to
show off its women more obviously or
effectively than does the modern“ col-
lege.”

Tomorrow night at 11:35 o’clock Dr. H. C. Carlson and his Pan-
ther cagers will entrain from the Pennsylvania station for Evans-
ton,‘Illinois, opening their annual mid-western basketball invasion
against the'Northwestern Wildcats Friday night. The game will be

through the mid-west. Last year in‘
their first mid-western jaunt the

games. played, winning -from North-
western, and being-nosed out in the
ﬁnal minutes in games against Pur-

due and. Butler”  far;-_ ; this - sea-5 :
son, the Panthers and the Wildcats-

have both played one game, and- each
team has managed to. score more
points than their opposition. The Pitt
varsity ran roughshod over an inex-

perienced Bucknell ﬁve last Satur-*

day night, running up a score of
52-22, while the Northwestern cagers
won their only game played 27-26,
against Marietta. Last year the Pitt
team defeated Northwestern. 27-23, at
Evanston.
Same Lineup to Start

Coach Carlson will probably rely
on the same starting lineup that de-
feated Bucknell last week in the
game with Northwestern Friday
night. Skippy Hughes and Ted Rode-
rick will team at the forward posi-
tions, Pete Noon again at center,
with ,_Claire Cribbs and Ross Emrick
taking care of thelguafd posts. Frank
Loucks. who led the scoring in the
Bucknell battle with 18 points, will
probably see plenty of action in the
game, alternating with Emrick at one
of the g.uard..posi_tio_ns.

Not altogether satisfied with his
team's showing in the Bucknell game
despite the large score, Dr. Carlson
resumed practice Monday evening for
the varsity without signs of a let-up.
The squad practiced yesterday and
will wind up its sessions this after-
noon. Dr. "Carlson hopes to smooth
out the team’s ﬂaws before embark-
ing for ihe mid-west and the three
strenuous battles.

The list of players that will entrain
tomorrow night for the trip_was post-
ed by Dr. Carlson today. Ten players
will make the journey, the players
being Claire Cribbs, Charley Hughes,
Pete Noon, Ross Emrick, Ted Rode-
rick, Frank Loucks, Ralph Ferguson.
Slim Vvainio, Bill Jesko, and Jim
Taylor. Manager Mallory and Dr.
Carlson will round out the party.

Thregiﬁanthers
Soon To Leave

For Sunny Cal

The recent cold spell has done
other things than bring out heavy
gloves and earmuffs. For three ‘Pan-
ther grid stars it has brought about
daily inspections of the calendar as
they count the days until Decem-
ber 18.

For on that day Izzy VVeinstock,
Doc Hartwig. and Miller Munjas will
climb aboard a train heading west
and in due time they will be away
from the cold and the snow and sun-
ning themselves in the territory
around San Francisco.

This is the good fortune that comes
to them as members of the all-East
team, an aggregation picked each
year to play a group of western all-
Stars in a charity game on New Year's
day. The game is sponsored by the
Shriners’ hospital.

Andy Kerr, co-coach of the eastern-
crs, selected the Pitt trio last week.
The Panthers will be a part of a party
of 22 players, 11 of them selected
from strictly eastern schools and the
other 11 selected from schools of the
mid-west.

Three appears to be the lucky num-
her for the Pitt boys, inasmuch as
three Panthers made the same trip
last year. Muggsy Skladany, Mike Se-
bastian, and Tiger W'alton were in-
cluded in the all-East aggregation
which Kerr selected then.

From reports made by these fol-
lows about _the trip it is no: hard to
justify Izzy and Doe and Miller in
their calendar-watching, aside from
getting out of the cold weather.

 

 

 

Carlson Scrimmages

Cagers At Shadyside

The Golden Panther basketball
squad took advantage of the old cus-
tom of mixing business with pleasure

when they journeyed to the Shady-
side academy last Monday night, the
pleasure being a dinner as guests of
the Academy; the business coming in
an after dinner scrimmage game be-
tween the Panther varsity and the
second team.

An interested audience watched Dr.
Carlson’s boys ﬂash the type of bask-
etball that Carlson hopes will ba1l’le
the three mid-western teams sched-
uled for this week-end. Three com-
plete teams scrirnmaged in the prac-
tice game, the stzirting teams lining
up with Cribbs, Emrick, Noon, Hughes,
and Roderick on one, with Jesko,
Loucks, Taylor, Ferguson, and W'ainio
on the other. The scrimmage was the
last the Panthers will engage in be-
fore the Northwestern game at Evans-
ton Friday night, the practices from
now until the game being light ones.

Saturday night, and Butler at
returning home. ‘ "

tions on the first eleven, and the re-
maining four places were filled by
grid stars from West Virginia, Notre
Dame, Nebraska, and Southern Cali-
fornia_

Two of the finest ends in the coun-
try comprise the wingmen on this all-
star eleven. Larsen of Minnesota, an
all-American in every department“ of
play, received the unanimous vote of
the varsity players for one end post.-I
Goodwin of West Virginia, one. of the
main reasons for the Mountaineers’
improved play this. seasonnis, at the
‘other terminal position. Lewis: ’l~‘e'ch ;,
Vairo, Notre Dame; and Tenner, Min-'
nesota—al1 of them good enough for
any team in the country—w.ere als

lectors were most ‘varied in their
opinions, naming eight players for the
two line places. Doloway, Carnegie
Tech, and Cutter, Navy, received 10
and 12 votes respectively to ﬁll the
tackle posts on the ﬁrst team. They
were followed closely by \Vidseth and
Bengston, Minnesota stalwarts, and
Stydahar, VVest Virginia. Cutter’s
ability as a place-kicker makes him
all the more versatile for this team.
Doloway was easily the outstanding
performer for Tech in the Thanksgiv-
ing day clash.‘

3 Toys Tend To Be:
More Realistic,
Says Reporter

Toys, books, games, and “things
that go” are the subjects discussed in
the last issue of the Fashion Reporter,
3. semi-monthly sheet published by the
Research Bureau for Retail Training
and sent to department store em-
ployees in the Pittsburgh and tri-state
area.

The trend this year, according to
the pamphlet, is towa.rd more useful
and realistic toys; toys that are copies
of grown-ups’ things, toys that Junior
can build with, dolls that move their
tongues when saying “mama,” cry
three different ways, and roll their
eyes.

For durability, blocks this year are
made of hard rubber with rounded
edges, in all shapes and colors. Push-
toys come aptly marked “\Va'ddling
penguins,” “Gabby goose,” “Drummer
bear,” and “Skipper Sam.”

An innovation for girls this season
is the new type of character dollsand
dolls of different nationalities: the
Shirley Temple, Oliver Twist, comic
strip dolls and rubber quintuplets.
The wardrobe for dolls sports plaid
raincoats, rubberized umbrellas and
zippers, and other accessories modeled
after adults’ wear.

Realism has entered into the chil-
dren’s furniture and house sets, too.
The doll houses this year are colonial
and old English with gbridge lamps,
drop-leaf tables, upholstered chairs,
and miniature electric stoves.

-FOP DOYS. there are educational
toys, things that go and things to do:
wheelbarrows, chemical sets, stream-
lined cars, magic sets and microscopes.

“Games and books for children have
fascinating new twists this year, too,”
the Fashion Reporter. concludes.

Cwen-‘-Druid Hop
Offers Programs
Tech ’s Band, Featured At

Buff andgreen moleskin dance pro-

_Cwens and Druids, sophomore honor-

ary activities fraternities, that their
dance today will be different. This
is the ﬁrst afternoon affair at which
programs will be distributed.

Dancing begins at 5:30 and contin-
ues until 8:30 o’clock to the music of
Tech Werron and his eight-piece Craig
Beach hotel orchestra, Instead of_the
usual long numbers, the dances will
be divided into 15 or 20 short medley
arrangements, ‘

This change in policy will furnish
the dancers an opportunity to meet
many more students than otherwise.
Every other number will be tag, while
the others are to be strictly program-
signed.

At this dance, the sophomore frater-
nities are offering activity-minded stu-
dents a* social get-together.‘ “Fresh-

inen interested in extra.-curricular ac-

tivities are especially invited to get
into the swing of things,” says Edwin

Freshmen Lead
In Chest Drive

Sophomore, First Year Classes
Pledge Half Of $2,000 Total

VVith returns on the 1934 Student
Chest drive standing near the $2,000
mark, a check—up of the available ﬁg-
ures reveals that the freshman and
sophomore classes contributed almost
half of that amount, a total of $990.

The freshman class tops the list
with $514, the sophomore class comes
second with $476, and the junior and
senior College classes third with $352.

The highest single class contribu-
tion was made by Education 76 with
$33.75 before which Dr, George Gould,
associate professor of education, rep-
resented the Student Chest.

.Cont1‘ib_utions from the School of
Education totaled $120 and from
the School of Engineering $155. Many
education and engineering students,
however, were represented in the
freshman and sophomore English
class returns. At the- present time
there are no available data on ‘the
School of Business Administrati‘on:o'r
the professional schools. Fraternities
who made their contributions through
regular class channels,irepo_rted 100
per cent participation in the Student
Chest. . . ~ .

Of the money collected through the
Student Chest, 50 per-centwill be
turned over to the Community Fund
from which the University YMCA re-
ceives support, 25 per cent to the Stu-
dent Loan fund, 20 per cent to the

YVVCA, and "5 per cent to Pitt-in-
China, On this basis the Community
fund will receive approximately

$1,000; the YWCA will get about $400;
the Student Loan fund $500; and Pitt-
in-China about $100. _

In the drive 122 classes made con-
tributions and 350 student workers
engaged actively. Homer C, ‘Wads-
worth, C35, president of the YMCA,
was the campaign chairman. He es-
timated that the 1934 Student Chest
drive exceeded 1933 by about $400.

Club Elects Oﬁicers

New oﬂicers for the German club
include Harold Peterson, Ed35, presi-
dent; Mary Lambie, C35, vice presi-
dent; Letitia Oster, Ed35, secretary,
and Albert Dietrich, C36, treasurer.
