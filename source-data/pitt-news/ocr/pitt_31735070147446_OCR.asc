Local advocates start

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

The smallcrowd that gathered¢out—
side a Port Authority board room in
the Heinz 57 Center last week grew
heated 20 minutes before building
security even unlocked the door to
let the group inside.

Itwas the ﬁrst meeting of the Al-
legheny County Transit Council fol-
lowing Port Authority’s armounce—
ment two weeks ago that 15 percent
service cuts will take effect in March.
Council members, bundledagainstthe
-mid—January cold, vented all sorts of
frustrations.

The group is comprised of elected
men andwomenwho representthe in-
terests ofPort Authority riders.Their_'

discussion, like many taking place in

advocacy and political action groups

citywide, focused mainly on ﬁnding
ways to convince the state legislature

to ﬁnd more ﬁmdingforpublic transit.

The council members argued that if
the system is downsized any further,

thecuts could reduce the economic

viability of Pittsburgh and the sur-

rounding region.

. “The only real answer is to work
with Gov. [Tom] Corbett’s people,”
one council member said, his red-knit
hatpulled low. -

“There’s notgoing to be anything
to ask for,” his companion replied.
“He’s pledged no new taxes and no
new fees. Where’s the money. going
to come from? Where is Harrisburg
goingto get it?” _

Allocations process still   unclear to some i    

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Despite an informational session this
past weekend on problems with allo-
cation requests, the Student Govem-
ment Board still dealt with confusion
overthe process from student leaders
in last nights meeting.

SGB has the power to allocate the .

Student Activities Fund — about $2.3
million — to certiﬁed student organi-
zations. The ﬁrnd is replenished by the

I $80 fee n0n—College of General Stud-

ies students pay each semester.
Because of recent confusion over
the allocations process, SGB president’
Molly Stieber held Allocations 101 Sat-
urday to provide insight into the logic
behind the Board’s ﬁscal decisions and
to alleviate the most common points
of confusion surrounding requests.

In Nordy’s Place last night, Josh
Jones, Panther Grappling Club presi-
dent, stood before the Board clad in
his organization’s T-shirt, to hear the
allocations verdict. 1
Jones explainedinane-mailbefore
last'night’s meeting that he has seen
his organizati0n’s members diminish
by almost halfsince 2009. He saidthis
was partly because the group did not
have an instructor. '
“We wanted $1,000 foraninstruc-
torfor our club [last semester]. Unfor-
tunately, last semester I could not get
a hold of any instructor and our club
lost interest in the eyes of studen ,”
Jones said. J
Butwhen he cametothe SGB meet-
ing, Jones didn’t get what he wanted.
Allocations Chair Mike Bane read
the comrnittee’s recommendation —
to deny $500 of] ones’ $1,000 request

. to bring an instructor to campus two

(lays aweek for12 weeks. A I
Bane explained that the commit-

. tee recommended only ﬁrnding for A
the instructor to come once a week

for15weeks. , '
.“Precedent has beenonce a week
' for 15 weeks,” Bane said.

Bane added that twice a week in-
struction falls more in line with the
deﬁnitiono “coaching,”and SGB does
not fund for coaches. The decision
was a blow forJones, who has been
trying to increase interest in his or-
ganization.

"Jones tried to appeal to the ‘

Board. _ -

"“‘People would show up at our If

practices asking, ‘Where is your in-
structor?’ I would never see that per-
son again,” he said.

The Board directed questions back A

to Bane before unanimously approv-
ing the Allocations Comrnittee’s rec-

~ ommendation to approve‘ only

rority Life Summer Rothrock met withjohn Has-
ley, Laurenjenﬂeson andjay Oriola,— presidents
for IFC, Panhel and NPHC, respectively— inthe
Student Affairs office for an hour and a halfyes-
terday aitemoon. - _
Hasley said yesterday afternoon thatthe social
probation of the three ﬁaternities was “another
thing we are trying to work out with the Univer-
sity.” ’ v
“They have approached me and asked why,”
he said, referring to the members of Alpha Ep-
silon Pi fraternity. “And I don’t have an answer
for them.” » .
Hasley declined to comment ﬁirther on the
situation, or onwhetherthe othertwoﬁ‘aternities
had contactedhim, ,_ .
A On Monday,Jentleson, Hasley_and Humphrey
met in the lobby of the Union and discussed the

- social probation issue.’

The leaders related concerns Greeks had ex-
pressedpreviouslyithatwhentheyagreedmshare
responsibility forthe incident, the Greek leaders
who attended the leadership summit had not in-
tended for the entire communitytobe punished.
They had meant that the attendees of the retreat
would take responsibility. .

Hasley had expressed a similar sentiment on

I Sunday.

“I thought the acknowledgement thatlwe
would take blame collectively meant that _we
would take blame collectively as those attend-
ing,” he said. ‘ g

A series of meetings scheduled for today -

onewiththemembersofIFC,onewith'Iri—Council ,

leaders and one with the organizers ofthe IIVIPACI‘
retreat — will likely determine the course of the
probation. '

 Hasley said on Sunday that the meeting with S

the _IMPACI‘ organizerswilllikely give the Greeks
awayto“ dua ’ﬁ‘omtheprogram, 
one of the University’s requirements for remov-

ingprobation.

The main issue between Greek leaders and
the administration seems tq come from a con-
versation that occurred onjan. 16, during which
the leaders said that they would take the blame
collectively. All the members of IFC, Panhel and
NPHC — not just those at the retreat —. were
placed on probation ﬁve days later.

Humphrey declinedto comment on the judi-
cialprocess thatwas usedinthe interim, orwhen
any hearings might have occurred.

Hasley,Jentleson and otherGreel_<leaders have
stated that they did not receive any formal com-
munication from the University about potential
repercussions before Friday, when they received
notice thatallTri—Councilfraternities and sorori-
ties would be placed on probation.

b Although the code of conduct does not explic-
itly state a right to waive the rights to a hearing,
Humphrey saidthatstudents ororganizations

billion budget deﬁcit predicted for Pennsylvania
next ﬁscal year, it will be no small task for the
state legislature to redirect more money to the

. Port Authority.
Corbett could not be reached for comment, -

but Port Authority spokesmanjim Ritchie said
the transit system is already in communication
with Corbett’s office. .

“We’ve beenincommunication with the state
govemmentforalong time, pretty consistently,”
Ritchie said. “Particularly for the last few years
with all these question marks coming up.”

Ritchie said the Port Authority’s conversation
with the new governor and state legislators is

followingthesame lines ithasbeen since befo
the cuts were announced. ’
“VVe’fe making sure they understand the
major reforms Port Authority has enacted in
thepastthree or so years,” he said. “We’ve made
speciﬁc reforms [as part of the Transit Devel-

opment Plan] that have been-asked for by the -

state, turning the system into something more
eﬂicient today. There is clearly not much more
room to cut.” ’ - R ,

Here at Pitt, at least one group concerned
about the potential impact of the cuts has already
taken its message to the snowy streets. Last week,
the student political action group PennPIRG co-
ordinatedai‘fake sale” to raise awareness among
student riders. .

The group handed‘ out free cookies, deco-
rated with the names of buses that will be' cut
or reduced, atseveral bustling Oakland stops on
Thursday. Its efforts have so far pulled in almost,
200 petition cards to be sent to state‘ Rep. Dan
Frankel, who represents Pennsylvania’s 23rd

“Ithinkpeople are  is as muchaHar-

to ﬁnd sustainable funding from the state.” ‘

PennP[RG hopes to collect at least 2,000
public statements about the cuts by the end of *
the spring semester. ' _

‘ Rep. Frankel said inan e—mail that he is well
aware of his constituents’ concerns when it
comes to public transit ' - -

“I’ve spoken publicly about the urgent need
for ﬁmds for mass transit. I urged [Rendell] to
provide emergency funds, which did preventim-
mediate catastrophic eﬁ'ects.‘Nowwe mustwork,
quickly, to ﬁnd a more permanent solution.”

‘ Frankel said he would support aproposal to

“The new administration has vowed not to

ﬁtt should set

clearer penalties

lthough members of Pitt’s
AGreek community were

caught breaking rules at
—— ironically — a leadership re-
treat, The Pitt News also ﬁnds the
University at fault in its handling
of the situation. To put it simply,
the punishment does not seem to
ﬁt the crime.

Putting all fraternities and so— l

rorities on social probation is an
extreme and unfair conseque_nce
for the admittedly inexcusable
actions of individual members;
For the University to include
in the social probation groups
that were unrepresented at the
off-campus retreat — including
Alpha Epsilon Pi, Iota Nu Delta
and Triangle fraternities —
seems especially unnecessary.

The University’s Student Code _»

of Conduct states that a frater-
nity or sorority may bear joint
responsibility for violations
made by individual members, but
not that all chapters may bear
responsibility for the action of
their counterparts within either
the Interfraternity Council, the
Panhellenic Association or Na-
tional Pan-Hellenic Council.

According to Ronjustice, the
director of Student Organiza-
tions Services at West».Vi_rginia
University, WVU doesn’t cus-
tomarily place groups on.blan-
ket sanctions and instead cre-
ates formulated action plans for
individual groups. justice, who
has been employed by WVU for
26 years, has never witnessed a
blanket social probation on the
campus.

“We address the individual
organization based on the vio-

lations to our student code,”

Justice said.

Pitt is not the only school to

see campus-wide restrictions on ,

Greek life. Fraternities and soror-
ities at Indiana University, Min-
nesota University and Texas A&M
University have all seen similar
social bans; at some schools, the
Greek councils placed restric-
tions on themselves. But in those
particular circumstances, the

universities or Greek councils-
. were reacting to serious incidents

such as hazing, sexual assaults or
the death of a ‘student.

While we don’t have a problem
with the Student Code of Conduct
for allowing a fraternity or soror-

‘ity, to_bear j oint responsibility for '

individual-member violations,
we think this type of action is
only appropriate in reaction to
serious incidents.

To punish all of the fraterni-
ties and sororities for reprehen-
sible but not life-endangering
actions of some individuals only

serves to alienate the entire Greek

community —— 10 percent of "our
campus — in an effort to set an
example. . ,

In the end‘, the probation does
little to punish the individuals
at fault since sucha widespread
probation is hard to actively
monitor and enforce. Accord-
ing to Vice Provost and Dean of
Students Kathy Humphrey, the
University. only checks in on
those under social probation if

‘it receives information about a

potential violation. How effec-
tive can this reactive approach
really be?

i For the future, we’d like the
University to ﬁgure out what it
wants punishments to be, clearly
deﬁne them and then enforce
them. .

Surefire plan for coaching champions

 
 
  

Oliver Bateman

Now that Pitt has shelled out big mon- _

such a lucrative racket. As always, we
stand ready to ﬁeld your burning que-

Before you get too deeply invested

in this venerable profession, you need

Once you’ve answered these ques-

abouttactics. Gameslike“MaddenNFL

team to gel, developing a high-octane
offense, playing tenacious defense,
makingplays on both sidesof the ball,
takingcare ofthe football, mill<ingthe

clock, splitting the uprights and so
forth.

Fantasy football, which is a game
played by nerds that involves assign-

mg points to various players’ statistical

achievements, is also helpﬁil if you’re I

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

I’d like to point out the Uni-

versity administration’s naivety .

when it came to the entire [Greek]
situation. If you take a bunch of
college kids, who ‘all happen to be
friends, and then throw them for
a weekend in a camp where days

I are ﬁlled with talks and leadership

exercises, social gatherings are
bound to ensue.

And as we all know, parties in
college almost always involve al-
cohol. It’s just a shame that the

people caught were Greeks, a,

group with a tradition of alcohol

use. If the Pathﬁnders or SGB had
a similar incident on a retreat, I
bet that they would not receive
the punishment we did, and that
they would be given the courtesy
of discussing punishment before it
is handed out. Greeks could poten-
tially be punished now for drink-
ing in their houses with friends
while watching the Super Bowl.

‘ Yes, some of the actions of the g
people who attended were shame-

ful, and punishment is rightly
deserved by the two people from
each house that attended. I can’t
imagine someone denying that
fact. Instead, Dean Humphrey

is -laying out a punishment for

_ more than.1o percent of the en-

tire school population for the ac-
tions of about 60 people. I would
like to ask her where the justice
is in that + or is she,‘along with
other segments of the University,
such as The Pitt News who staked
out fraternities for violations, just
forgetting the good Greeks do for
this campus and trying to get rid
of us? '_ - '

It's NOT EASY BEING GREEN

'_ There’s nothing quite as prevalent

as the public apology, and certainly
nothing quite as gratifying. Everyone

somehow left feeling empty and un-

are just more lies dolloped onto agiant

According to a recent study, this
feelingof skepticism toward apolo-
gies is an increasingtrend. Research-
ers from Erasmus University in the
Netherlands found that “while people

wanted an apology and rated it as
highly valuable, the actual apology is

Basically, this study says that al-
thoughintheoryapologies seem great,
actual real-life apologies suck, because
no one actually means them.

At ﬁrst glance, this study seems
just another no-duh method of spend-
ing grant money to statistically prove
the obvious (like the recent University
of Minnesota study that discovered
that people get drunk at tailgates,

’ shockinglyl). But after a second,
more contemplative look, this study '

actually uncovers a sad truth: We, as
a people, are so cynical that we au-
tomatically assume all apologies are
disingenuous. '
Ponderingthis, I suddenly felt the
pangs of lost innocence. Atwhat age
did we become so jaded, so relent-
lessly untrusting, that underneath
our cold, hardexteriors there’s just

a colder, harder interior? (Age 10 or
11 is my guess — about the same age

as Ben Aflleck exhibitedin“'I‘he Voy-
age of the Mimi.” And for the record,
young Ben Aﬂleck, I did not believe
for one second that you were actually

concerned about the theft of ancient

Mayan artifacts.

l Orhow aboutpolitical apologies?
Year after year, our elected oflicials
haveapologized for everything from
unsavory comments and indiscretions

to blaspheming his holiness Rush _

Limbaugh (seriously, so many Repub-
licans apologized for comments they’d
made criticizing Limbaugh that the

' Democratic Congressional Campaign

Committee engineeredanonlineﬁll-
in—the-blankapologyprototype titled,
“I.’m Sony, Rush”).

I’ll admit that every once in a

. while, I sense sincerity in an apology‘

— and like a vulture to a mutilated
road-ravaged deer, so do I gorge my-
self upon this rare morsel of truly

U pathetic remorse.

Take, for instance, former Gov.
Mark Sanford, R-S.C. True, upon ﬁrst

' inspection, Sanford isjust another V

low~life, degenerate, philandering,
job-abandoning conservative. But
throughout his rambling public apol-
ogy, during which he apologized to

. hiswife,hissons,hisﬁiends,hi_scon-

stituents and pretty much everyone
else inthe country for cheatingonhis
wife and abandoning the state with-

‘ out notice to rendezvous withhisAr-

gentinean mistress, Sanford choked
up. We saw real emotion — his voice
cracked, his posture sagged and the

Why world would improve with more Gov. Sanfords

bags underhis eyes trembled liketwo
great bowls of]ell—O_]igglers.

Duringthe speech, Sanford admit-
ted that he “spent the last ﬁve days
crying.” And I’m not talking about
Glenn—Beck, eye-drop-inspiredtears,
but real goddamntears ——the things
Lifetime movies are made of.

Unfortunately -— and I never
thought I’d say these words —— there
are not enough Mark Sanfords in the
world. So many apologies these days
are robotic, mere algorithms; one
part solemnity, ﬁve parts ticking off
as many personal apologies as Oscar
winners do thank—yous.

And although public apologies are
often the leastauthentic — after all,
celebrities and public ﬁgures have the
most to gain bywimiingback over the
masses — the sincerity of everyday
apologies is taken for granted.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

We have many problems with
O1iverlBateman’s column, “After
MLK day, now time to seduce
‘sweetie.”’ ' Z

The proposition that men
should make women feel more

self—conscious is irresponsible.

One in 10 college-aged women. -
suffer from eating disorders,‘

and 1,000 women die each year
from anorexia nervosa, accord-
ing to the National Institute on

. Media and the Family. When

women’s lives are literally being
destroyed by a society-driven
need forlphysical perfection, a
column like this is insensitive and
reprehensible.

We can only, imagine what

Bateman means by suggesting
that men buy women lots of beer
to “loosen [them] up.” Between
25 percent and 50 percent of fe-
male college students experience
sexual assault, and 50 percent
of these assaults involve alco-
hol consumption, according to
the National Institute on Alco-
hol Abuse. Forget “seducing the
sweetie,” why not just call the

article “date rape for the mod-

ern Joe”?

Bateman also reduces women
to extreme stereotypes. Implying
that women’s only interests are
gossip magazines is outrageous
and belittling. S

Most women have wide inter-
ests in culture, religion and poli-
tics. We wonder if Bateman has

taken the time to get to know any

women as individuals. Also, Bate— .

man’s heteronormative perspec-
tive ignores the fact that many
women simply aren’t interested

' in men.

While .it’s evident that Bate-
man’s column was meant as hu-
mor, it was extremely offensive

T and harmful to our community.

Sexist humor promotes dis-
crimination, hostility and rape.
By printing this article, The Pitt
News is doing just that. We de-
serve an apology.

Sincerely,

Robin Lane

The iPad’s numerous add—ons — beyond just books — might make it appealing for some students, but ,
eReaders still haven’t gained much popularity on college campuses.

Most Pitt students will tell you that
textbooks are .cumbersome and ex-
pensive. Whether eReaders present
a better alternative, however, is up

. for debate.

Despite growing national popu—
larity — last December, Amazon
reported that its third-generation
Kindle was the highest—selling item
in the company’s history -.— eRead-
ers remain scarce on campus. In fact,
The PittNews recently reported that
electronic textbooks account for
less than 1 percent of total textbooks
sales from the Book Center.

Nevertheless, faculty members
like poet and Pitt writing profes-
sor CMvBurroughs are choosing
to make the switch. Burroughs
has gone completely paperless in
her personal life and her classes,
mostly through use of her eReader,
an iPad.

r more than books  

“I am a minimalist and attempt I

to live with a focus on being green,
so my use of the iPad as a library
inside and outside of the classroom
has been a beneﬁcial part of my life-
style,” Burroughs said.

Burroughs digitized her personal
library —— scanning about 500 out
of 1,000 books into her iPad -— and
now uses the device for personal
composition. V

As apoet, Burroughs said being

able to write on the go .—. sans paper --

A f‘I don’t think that this technol-
ogy is for everyone. But I am mini-

constantly in my academic and ar-

THEATER REVIEW

Group fizzles duringphenomenal dance season

Ben Labe
Staff Writer

The Stephen Petronio

Company .
Choreographed by Stephe
Petronio
Jan. 22

ByhamTheater
Grade: B-

. After being blown away by the Pitts-

burgh Dance Council’s presentations
of Rioult and Pilobolus last semester,
I must admit that I had high hopes
for the Stephen Petronio Company’s
visit to the Byham Theater last Sat-
urday night. However, those hopes
were quickly dashed as Iwatched the
performance unfold.

Petronio’s choreography was ad-
equate. His dancers were talented, and
each of his pieces had beautiﬁil mo-
ments.Yet each one failed to captivate

or to elevate my interest beyond the
level of basic technical appreciation.

The show consisted of ﬁve pieces,
ranging from a solo that Petronio ﬁrst
choreographed in1986 toanensemble
piece that premiered only last year.
The pieces offered a terriﬁc range of
music and a thorough introduction
to Petronio’s repertoire.

Petronio choreographed the ﬁrst
piece, called “#3,” in the conﬁnes of a

claustrophobic Manhattan apartment .

where he lived ‘during the earlier part
of his career. Not to be undone by the
small space, he decided that his feet

‘would stay stationary. The piece be-

came an interesting experiment in re-
striction. The music, by Lenny Pickett,

was bluesy and rhythmic. Although ‘

Petronio’s movements were unique,
the dancewas too slow to develop and,
like most ofthe pieces that night, itleft
me wondering when it would ﬁnish.

The second piece, choreographed
in 1990, was “MiddleSexGorge.’.’

Petronio had been deeply involved in '

tryingto raise awareness inNewYork
City of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s.
Evidently, the piece was an attempt
to tackle that subject. Yet it could have
been about anything—therewas little
within the piece to signal any meaning
atall. The musicwas irritatingand re-
petitive, the piecewasunderdeveloped
thematically, the partnering seemed
uncomfortable and contrived and the
costumes were distracting.

Two of the men wore white corsets
andwhite tights coveredinpink roses,
and the other three simply wore black
corsets and thongs. The costumes
were distracting not because of the
dancers’ nudity, but because their
signiﬁcance within the dance was in-
decipherable.

The two bestpieces were in the sec-
ond act — unfortimately, they were

MUSIC COLUMN

Khalifa’s hometown pride not anovelty in popularmusicj

  

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

Local pride and music areinextricably
linked. Particularly-in Pittsburgh, where
Wiz Khalifa’s “Black and Yellow” currently
rings as a sort of victory anthem for the
’Burgh after the Steelers’ latest win.

The Taylor Allderdice High School"
alumnus is blowing up as big as the team
with a song that champions his city at a
moment of achievement.

That pride is something that runs deep
through every variety_of musician who,

‘ as an ambassador to the widerworld, at-

tempts to represent his home. This isn’t
a new idea —- bands have been making
music celebrating their hometowns for a
long time. There’S more than just “Black
and Yellow” out there when it comes to
hometown anthems, but that’s_a’ good
place to start. ’

Khalifa’s civic pride has long been es-
tablished, and to many he’s the “-home—'
town hero” of hip-hop. But after “Black
and Yellow” came out, even the most se-

. cluded yinzers came to know his name.

Heck, my own Facebook newsfeed started

to blow up with people from all over going
crazy over Khalifa, That’s not to say that
the song isn’t Without its critics.

I’ve heard that people complain be-
cause the Steelers’ actual colors are black
and gold rather than blacka-nd yellow, but

A the song’s not just- about the Steelers. The

city is not deﬁned by, but rather enhanced
by its teams which all wear some variation
of the colors. V

~ And that’s a loose interpretation. I hate

same kind of banner—waving spirit — but
it won’t make any Penguins fans particu-
larly_happy. The song is about the Boston
Bruins hockey team and, after an opening
accordion riff, it l_aunches into an auditory
barrage of rock ’n’ roll thatliterally yells
“GO GO BLACK AND GOLD.” O

“Time to Go,” is just one of the Mur-
phys’ songs dedicated to Boston, and few
contemporary groups have been as vocal
about their city. O ‘

ing the song for his city (I won’t mention
any names...) — isn’t that some sort of ‘

band Dropkick Murphys that embraces the 1

Through its live covers of “Nut Rocker”

(the Bruins’ intro music) and “Dirty Wa-_

ter” (a garage rock classic about Boston)
or its charity EP “Tessie” featuring an
updated version of the -Red Sox anthem,
the Murphys are a reason that many know

‘the city, outside and inside of “The De-

partedﬁ’
The Dropkick Murphys come from a
long tradition of representing one’s home

-.—— a sentiment which was central to the
group’s heroes in the English “Oi!” move-
ment. During the late 1970s, the blood-
shed and violence of England’s rooted

.. soccer hooliganism met the newly bur.-5,

geoning punk-rock scene and the country’s

working-class youth took notice to create -

this new form. .

Groups like Cockney Rejects performed
songs that, similar to “Black and Yellow,”
expressed love for and dedication to their.
team.

The Rejects just happened to be fans of
West Ham United, and when they chose
to cover the West Hamanthem “Bubbles,”

-fights among soccer hooligans ignited_d1.1r.-

ing their tours throughout England.

The group only lasted afew years -;
partly because everywhere it went, the
sports culture demanded the West Ham
anthem be opposed. Rather than a song
that unitedpeople, “Bubbles” proved to
make early British‘ fans of the genre hostile
even while they enjoyed the music itself.

Every city has its own songs — and I’m

obviously omitting some big ones —— but A 2

even with just these three examples, it’s

- easy to see the depth and passion that

Students offer mixed reviews
despite eReaders saving paper

downloaded onto eReaders. The eReaders
negate the need to print out these assign-
ments, allowing students to preserve their
University paper allowance.

But Pitt information sciences professor
Geoffrey C. Bowker sees some potential down-
sides to what might seem ideal.

- According to the professor, a senior scholar
of cyberscholarship in the School of Informa-
tion Sciences, “Only with the iPad do we have
a reader that deals OK with PDFs, which is the
form of many academic articles.” , .

He also explained that students who like

V on their readings might have trouble .
' as “notetaking and marginalia are very dif-
. ﬁcult and clunky.” '

Suidents cited similar drawbacks ofeRead—
ers.’ .

Last fall, Amazon gave Princeton Univer-
sity a number of Kindle DXs to pilot a study on
the extent to which eReaders are actually used
in college. Although the researchers found .
that the amount of paper used to print read-
ings in some classes dropped by as much as
50 percent among the Kindle users, students
believed that the eReaders needed to undergo
further changes before going mainstreambn _

' campus.

Speciﬁcally, students cited the following
ﬁve reasons as the most important improve-
ments for eReaders to implement: “the ability
to highlight and annotate PDF ﬁles, improv-
ing the annotation tools, providing a folder

structure to keep similar readings together,

improving the highlighting ﬁinction and im-
proving the navigation within and between
documents on the reader (including having
more‘ than one document open at the same
time for comparison)?’

Overall-, researchers found that students
tend to prefer not using devices like the Kindle
for eTextbooks. S .

But the iPad offers more than eBooks. The
App Store offers students the optionto down-
load many educational applications — some
free and some available for a small fee. These
include Star Walk, the most downloaded app
under the education category, which allows

_students to visualize constellations and track

stars’ movements; Spanish Touch Trainer,
which presents itself as a means of memoriz-
ing Spanish verbs in an aesthetically pleasing
way; a graphing calculator app, and an app
for the popular online calculus tool Wolfra-
mAlpha. . ‘
_Because of this progress, eReader propo-
nents remain optimistic. 1
Stephanie Mantello, the senior public rela-
tions manager for the Kindle, said in an e—mail
that “[Amazon] will continue to innovate 
and will always look at ways of improving the

student experience on Kindle.’.’ -
1‘ SGB president Molly Stieber,’who uses an
iPad, said she thinks eReaders will grow as a

presence on campuses.

“I remember when [eReaders] were new _

and scary,” Stieber said. “But now I truly think
they are the ﬁiture.” _I

Inconsistent quality in dances

also the shortest. “Love Me Tender” and “Foreign
Import” were clean and refreshing. The ﬁrst, a
solo performed to the famous Elvis Presley song, .
was ﬂuid and balletic. Meanwhile, interspersed
moments of percussive chugs complemented
the music andthe dancinginawaythatwastruly ‘
unpredictable. _

“Foreign Import,” which showcased two
female dancers in billowing white costumes
contrasted by a strong, domineering male, was
elegant and picturesque. The dance was set to
an acoustic version of Radiohead’s “Creep” also
helped its appeal. '.

l The lighting for these pieces was similarly
more -intriguing than at other times. Featuring
fading green and purple backdrops, the lights
ﬁamedthe dancersinasubdued atmosphere that
complemented the long, controlled extensions
and linear suspensions ofthe choreography. The
rest of the pieces were set off onlybywhite. The
design was technically competent —- it added

dimensiontothedancersandtothestage—but '

againitfailedtograbme. I 1
By the ﬁnal piece, “Ghostown,” I was ready

for Petronio to make a complete comeback. But
instead of resembling the previous two pieces,
 onewas alotlike“MiddleSexGorge” — long,
tiresome and containinganinscrutable message.

It tried to create the mood of a ghost town —— ’

Game’ against Syracuse should serve as a rebounding challenge as Pitt looks for second Big East win

Staﬁ"-Writer

For the Pitt women’s» basketball
team, there could be such a thing
as. E1 moral victory in a loss. “
Whenthe Panthers travel to
face Syracuse at 7 p.m._today, they
will look to build upon the posi-

tive points of their most recent

loss to No. 2 Connecticut.
Despite falling 66-46 to the
Huskies, Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato believed that her team
played competitively for the ma-
jority of the game.
“I thought the game was awe-

some for ssgminutes,” Berenato ~
- said after the loss. “We came into

this game ready to compete and

Iwas highly encouraged by our:

performance.”
"She brushed over a 5-minute
scoring drought in the second

half, which led to a 13-point Con-

A complete game will be nec-

The Orange gained their ﬁrst

“We were down at half-time,

How many NBA teams lookilsilly
for passing on Dejuan Blair in the
2009 NBA draft?
- Well, a lot more lately.
Blair recorded double-doubles.

in three of his last ﬁve games as a V

starter for the San Antonio Spurs,

the team with the NBA’s best re-

cord.

Against Dallas on Jan-14, Blair
went for 18 points and 13 rebounds
in 30 minutes. He.f01lowed that
with 22 points and 11 rebounds in
35 minutes against Toronto.

Blair’s most impressive perfor-
mance, though, came against the
New York Knicks: He ﬁnished with
18 points, 13 rebounds, three blocks
and four steals in 42 minutes. I’d
want him on my team. How about
you? . , -

performing better than that. Yet
an entire ﬁrst round and part of

team “took a chance” on Blair. This
happened for two major reasons.
The ﬁrst was that Blair was an un-

But then there were his knees.
I wish I had counted the number
‘of times a draft analyst mentioned
Blair’s ACL—less knees. Blair seemed
to do ﬁne with those horrible knees
as a First Team All-American in col-

’ lege. In my opinion, he was worth

the risk. The Spurs seemed to think
so too.
_ Let’s take a look at a few teams

to come out and play hard- in the
second half. _

‘“We were sick of losing,” Alex-
ander said after the game. “Once
we got the rebounds and the easy
shots, we had a good chance of
winning.”

That formula proved success-
ful as Alexander finishedthe game
with 17 points and 10 rebounds.
Holding Alexander in check down
low will be a key aspect to the
game, as the two squads are two
of the better rebounding teams
in the league.

Although Alexander will pres-4

V Pitt senior forward Chelsea Cole

has likewise been a force on the

boards and her matchup against *

Alexander down low will be one

to watch as a potential key to the ‘

game V .

With her 10 points and 12 re-
bounds against Connecticut, Cole
earned her ninth double-double
performance of the season and
her 12”‘ game with double-digit
rebounding ﬁgures.

that passed on Blair. With the 24th
pick of the draft, the Dallas Maver-
icks selected Ohio State freshman
Byron Mullens and then immedi-
ately traded him to Oklahoma City.
Mullens” averaged 8.8 points and
4.7 rebounds during his only year
in college.‘Blair was averaging 15.7
points and 12.3 rebounds when he
declared for the draft.

' Mullens is averaging 1.3 points
and 1.6 rebounds per game for
Oklahoma City. Oh, and he’s mak-
ing $1,204,200 to Blair’s $918,000.
One of those players proved to be
a dominant force in college and is

I already making a name for himself

in the NBA. Hint: It’s not the guy

And just for fun, let’s get a quick
laugh in at Memphis’ expense. They
took Hasheem Thabeet based on
potential as the second overall pick.
After spending some time in the

A NBA developmental league, the

equivalent to MLB’s minor leagues,
Thabeet is now averaging an impos-

' the basket will be essential in

hindering the Orange’s interior

, attack, which has been one of

the team’s strongest areas on
the. court. Cole currently ranks
second in the conference in de-
fensive rebounds per game, av-
eraging six. ‘ ,

Assisting Cole in these efforts
will be fellow senior forward

‘ Shayla Scott, who ranks just be-

hind Cole at No. 3 in the confer-
ence in defensive rebounds per
game, with 5.7 rebounds.

. Syracuse leads the Big East
in offensive rebounds and trails
only Connecticut in the defensive
rebounding category.

As far as offensive production,
the Panthers will rely heavily on
their starting lineup, as the ﬁve
starters accounted for all but one
of Pitt’s 46 points against Con-
necticut. ‘

Bleacher Report wrote a 2oo§'
NBA Re—draft, which looked back
at where players ‘in that draft
should’ve. been taken. It put Blair
ninth, going tothe Toronto Rap-
tors. The Raptors are in need of
rebounding and intensity, the site
writes, and Blair would’ve brought
both to the ﬂoor..

Other teams that could use
Blair’s rebounding and intensity?
Cleveland, for one. The Cavaliers
took Christian Eyenga, a guard;
from the Congo. The Detroit Pis-
tons are the league’s second worst

In the second round, they chose

from the team’s younger players
