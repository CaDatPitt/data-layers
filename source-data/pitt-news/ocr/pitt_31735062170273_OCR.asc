University Expansion
Seen to Become Reality

by JIM HOSEK
(DPPAJ-—Construction of new educational facilities for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh will begin soon on the site of Forbes Field. ac-
_ cording to Bernard J. Kobosky. Vice-Chancellor for Public Affairs.

The structures to be built there include a two-story addition to the
.ear of Lawrence Hall. a six-story School of Law Building and a six-

story Professional Quadrangle building to house the Schools of Educa-
§.~ tion and Social Sciences.

“The Law School,” said Kobosky, “will be the first building to be

constructed. But the first the demolition of the Civic Center Motel and
restaurant will have to take plac'e. This should start sometime this

week.”

Plans for future expansion. said Kobosky. are only in the discussion-
al stage. The University is still working with Oakland Development _In—
corporated (ODI). which is composed of both members of the com-
munity and the University, in regard to the building problems.

The block bordered by South Bouquet St..»Oakland Ave.. Forbes
Ave. and Sennot St., for’ example, is_ still a subject of great concern.

The University and the community through ODI are at the present
time discussing how best to utilize that land area. The idea, according
to Kobosky, is to plan facilities which are beneficial to both Pitt and the
community. The land at the present time is owned by the General State

Authority.

 In regard to the Student Government Student Union Task Force.
Kobosky felt that the investigation into facilities for a renovated or

new Student Union was a good idea.

“I personally prefer the renovation of the present structure.
- Schenley Hall, as compared to the idea of building a new structure.“

said Kobosky.

“It would be much more advantageous to the community to reno-
vate Schenley Hall since there is a definite shortage of land in the Oak-
land area. It would also benefit the University since it would be saving

money.”

I

‘Kobosky. however. pointed out that the possibilities of the renova-
tion of Schenley Hall as a new Student Union were "not in the near

future."

He also added that he would be "willing to help in any way possi-

ble to help bring about the change."

Homecoming Ca ncliclates Sought

Merit Award Proposed

by BOB GEDEKOH
Members of the Homecoming

Committee are looking for a jun-.

ior or senior who is worthy of the
newly created Blue and Gold
Award. The $250 prize will be
awarded during homecoming. to
the student who has made the
"most important social contribu-
tions to the University." accord-
ing to Louise Lutian. the head of
the Homecoming Publicity Com-

C 'rnj_ttee.

I

 tudents interested in compet-

iling for the award should pick up .

applications in the Cathedral of
Learning Basement. the Student
Union or the dorm lobbies. Both
male and female students are eli-
gible. Lutian added that there will
be “no financial or academic re-
quirements. but applicants must
be Pennsylvania residents in good
standing with the University.”
Applications must be returned to
room 107 Student Union by Sept.
29.

The Iron City Brewing Compa-
-.v is funding the award this year,
,.’ Lutian noted that in future

-- ‘ years the committee hopes to line

_ up more sponsors so that trhel

amount awarded will increase.
The Iron City Company is also

‘sponsoring a keg rolling contest

in conjunction with Homecoming
‘72. Any three individuals can or-
ganize a team and compete for the
cash prize which will be awarded
to the winner. Preliminary races
will be held on the Cathedral lawn
and the finals will be hel_d at the
stadium just before the West Vir-
ginia game.

Lutian also noted that the com-
mittee has decided to sponsor a
homecoming queen competition
this year instead of a Pitt Woman.
She added that this years queen
will be named at the reception on
Wednesday night and will serve
as a hostess during the homecom-
ing activities.

Women interested in competing
for the position must be nomin-
ated by some campus organiza-
tion. This year‘s queen will be
chosen by two methods: a student
vote and a decision by a panel of
judges. Both will carry equal
weight. "We are using this sys-
tem of judging so that it won‘t be
a beauty or popularity contest."
Lutian said’. -

_ University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Revamped

Judicial

by RICK EULER

Pitt students are under a new
University Student Judicial Sys-

tem with two basic components: '

a network of judicial bodies and
a Student Code of Conduct (SCC).

"It will be their responsibility
to regulate prescribed student
conduct and to adjudicate alleged
violations of the Student ‘Code of
Conduct." according to Supervi-
sor Alden Earl Bowen.

The highest judicial body is
the University Review Board. It
is an appellate body and serves in
an advisory capacity to the Chan-
cellor.' The board, according to

‘ Bowen, will review the decisions

made by the lower judicial bodies
and make recommendations to
the Chancellor who will make fin-
al decisions.

Operating under the University
Review Board (URB) are the
Campus Judicial Board (CJB) and
the Residence Hall Judicial Board
(RHJB). The former will deal
with general interpretation of the
SCC while the latter will deal with
specific applications of the SCC
to residence Hall life.-

Bowen added that he hoped each
school at the University would
eventually develop its own judi-
cial body to work within the sys-
tem. These bodies would handle
such departmental problems as
cheating and plagiarism. ‘

The SCC itself outlines “student
rights and responsibilities,” said
Bowen. It will apply to all aspects
of rumpus life, except for those
special situations covered by the
Supplemental Residence Hall
Provisions. This is different from
the past, when there was a sep-
arate Residence Hall Code.

apply to all aspects of campus
life." Bowen explained. “we hope

to achieve uniformity and equal-
ity in the judicial process.“

The code is the final product
of a committee appointed by the
Chancellor. This Committees (the
Student - Faculty - Trustee Joint
Committee on Rights and -Respon-
sibilities) draft was receivedby
the Chancellor and Board of Trus-
tees on Monday.

PIRG Initiates Courses;

Mailing Plea For Fundin

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD
' ‘News Editor

The controversy following the
Board of Trustees‘ refusal to al-
-low the University to beused as a
collection agency for Pitt's Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG)
by including its $2 per term self
imposed "tax" on the academic
invoice has resultedin PIRG‘s ini-
tiating an undergraduate student
mailing plea as the vehicle for the
collection of funds.

A mailing of 18.000 undergrad-

uates has so far elicited only 300 -

responses.
Pitt PIRG is to be run “as a co-

ordinator of PIRG at the Univer-
sity, according to Ed Skopinski,

acting coordinator of PIRG at the‘

University.

The funds from the student
mailing will go to support West»
ern Pennsylvania PIRG which
consists of Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
vérsity. Chatham. Duquesne and
Pitt.

All four campuses are to set up
a Central Western Pennsylvania
PIRG and "hopefully." Skorpinski
added. "we -will have enough
money to hire a full-time lawyer.“

The purpose of PIRG. as out-

lined in the first PIRG newsletter
states:

“Western Pennsylvania Public In-
terest Research Group will be a
non-partisan organization repre-
senting 'the concerns of Western

Pennsylvania college students and '

g

working for constructive change. = ‘'

Zelienople Camp

by KAREN BURGIO

More than 160 tired. but gen-
erally happy freshmen returned

'from the wilds of Camp Kon- .

O-Kwee. near Zelienople. Mon-
day night, rounding up the 40th
annual Freshman Fall Weekend.
Close to seventy staff members.
counselors and faculty also at-
tended.

‘The weekend began Saturday
at 4. under the guidance of Stan-
ley Dupell. Chairman and John
Simelis, Co-Chairman.

Others on the committee in-
cluded: Vince Ballestrino, Tom
Bailey, Van Wilburn, Marguer-
ite Donoghue, Diane Home-
_ quest and Christine Beck.

Upon their arrival at ‘Kon-O-
Kwee. the freshmen were divid-
ed into eight different groups.
and each group was told to
choose a name and plan a strate-
gy to make -their group the
loudest at mea1time—or anytime
they had the urge to scream
their lungs out.

Why the obsession to win?

gs’ Before camp. they were told
 the prize was a two-foot gold

loving cup. inscribed with the
winning group’s name and plac-
ed ‘for all to see in the Student
Union. (As experienced Kon-O-
Kweeres know this just isn‘t so.)

‘Many freshman. under names’

like Fudd. Oakland Raiders.
Jets. Bedsprings, Screaming
Flock. Hot Dawgs. Mofurats and
began softball. pool.
singing ’and spirit competitions
withernest. ’

Monday afternoon the great
moment arrived. With the
announcement of the Oakland
Raiders as the winners, mem-

 

bers of that group pulled their
hard earned trophy from the
box —- a pewter pitcher, circa
World War Two, with Fresh-
man Fall Weekend ‘72 lettered
in black paint.

But camp wasn't all work, A
dance. featuring Maple. and a
midnight swim took Saturdays
free time; and movies. "The

~Great Escape.“ "Oceans 11“ and

"The Premature Burial“ were
shown Sunday night. in addition
to a campfire.

And. of course. camp director
Harry Kramer‘s sayings at meal-
time like. "Wherever you go.
there you are.” added to the
spirit of things.

Olympic Events Admired, Deplored

.by JOHN METCALF

Watching the TV Olymp_ics
lately has been a great'adven-
ture. Even without the political
murders there was plenty to be
admired and deplored. One event
that meets the standards for both

Dachau is a suburb of Munich.

was always surprised that there
should be an exit by that name.

even more startled. But we never
stopped there. We had things to
do and places to go. and it never

there.

A small emergency did it. Once.
as we were passing near the
Dachau exit. I. found myself

Rock Opera Feafu ed

and silver signs announce the
exits for American bases in
Germany. and one marked the
turnoff for Dachau. In Germany.
cigarettes cost 70 cents a pack.
With an I.D. card. anyone. even a
civilian like me. could buy them
for a quarter. So we wound up in
Dachau.

The Autobahn funnels off into
a quiet community, almost a
village. Comfortable houses, wide-
ly spaced for Europe, and plenty

. of trees along the streets. Again

there are small signs leading to
the American base; around a sud-
den corner and there it is.

It is Dachau, once a concen-
tration camp. now mostly a mem-
orial. Its motto. repeated in
English, French. German and
Hebrew is simple: .

"Never Again."

The rest of Dachau is a laun- ‘

It is the central laundry for
our troops stationed in the Mun-
ich area. The road in and the

road out pass painful monu-
ments to what we can do to one
another, and then there is the

cafeteria and tavern, in the mid:

do not have Army ID.‘ cards, but-

if they did, they too could buy
cigarettes for a quarter.

Like the whole place, the
Kantine seems huge and hollow,
and seems to echo a past we’d
rather not hear. They do have a

our way without speaking for a

Page 4-—"rHE_: PITT NEWS—Friday, September 3, 1972

by WILLIAM P. PYKOSH

The Democrats’ 1972 presidential candidate
George McGovern will, it is generally conceded,
experience a difficult, uphill battle against President

 Nixon in the November election. Traditionally, Demo-
I crats have closed ranks and directed their united ef-
 , forts towards achieving victory for their party‘s con-

vention choice, regardless of how bitter the struggles

if if 1 before the party’s candidate was finally chosen.

. This unity of effort, this instinctive loyalty to their

 party’s candidate, has enabled the Democratic Party

to control the presidency in seven out of nine presi-

 f dential elections of the last 40 years, and almost won

the presidency for the Democrats against Nixon in the

_ 1968 presidential election. In early September Richard
I‘ Nixon had an overwhelming lead over Hubert Hum-
‘ phrey.‘ But as the election approached, the traditional

supporters of the Democratic Party—the laboring people,

, the union members, the lower middle class, the ethnic

Americans—began "to return to the fold, and on election

'day"1968, the Republican candidate barely squeaked by

in the popular vote majority. Today, Nixon’s victory

 ' seems a certainty—more of a certainty than it seemed in
1968. Will history repeat itself once more? Will the
 ‘traditional supporters of the Democratic Party return
:.;‘,to it and cast their votes for McGovern, the Demo-
' cratic nominee, nojmatter how determined they may

seem to be to vote Republican?

This is what the supporters of McGovern hope
will come about—that no matter how repelled the tra-

"ditional Democrat voters may be by the insolent, arro-
 gant, unshaven, unwasted, pot-smoking, free-love prac-

ticing‘ supporters of McGovern (or at least by how they
perceive the McGovern activists to be) that as the first

 Tuesday after the first Monday in November approaches,
__ they will recall their traditional loyalty and cast their
" votes for McGovern.

McGovern supporters also -hope the 18-21 year old

1 Voters who will be given their first chance to vote in a

presidential election this November, will insure Mc-

, 7  Govern the votes he needs to win the presidency.

But will this pro-McGovern vote turn out on elec-
ion day _as hoped? Most likely it will not. Most likely Mc-

’.;Govern will go down in a smashing defeat, and Nixon will_

be president for another four years.

Lessons, however, can be learned by objectively
considering the McGovern candidacy; lessons, which,
if properly implemented, can be of great use to future
attempts by political liberals to win the White House.

First, a truly sincere candidate must be found.
McGovern’s professed liberalism and progressivism
leave much to be desired for sincerity. Many who sup-
ported McGovern did so because they honestly be-
lieved he would take proper stands on such issues
as the liberalization of marijuana and sex laws, and on
the ending of the war in Viet Nam. It was indeed dis-
heartening to see McGovern at the convention apologize
that he would, if elected President of the United States,
find it necessary to keep a residual force of American
servicemen in Viet Nam indefinetely. It was likewise
disconcerting to- hear McGovern flatly refuse to pledge
himself to the implementation of progressive ideals on
marijuana and sexual relations.

Such. lack of integrity by McGovern naturally
dampens the enthusiasm of his supporters, and makes
it less likely the great mass of young voters will flock
to McGovern’s banner in November. The answer that
these people will have to vote for McGovern “because
they have no place else to go” is inadequate.

No one has to vote in an American presidential
election. He can just stay home and refuse to vote if
he thinks that his interests will not be served by the
election of either candidate. Seven out of ten ‘young
persons (18-21) are expected by McGovern strategists
to vote for McGovern if they vote. But if they are not
satisfied with McGovern’s sincerity, they may well not
even bother to vote.

The traditional Democrat voters ended up finally
voting for Hubert H. Humphrey on election day 1968,
because they found in Humphrey a person for whom
they could feel trust. But such people will not be able
to feel similar trust for McGovern. His arrogance of-
fended too many factions and groups within the party,

factions and groups whose votes areneeded to effect

anelectoral majority.
In attempting to enlist the enthusiasm of the Mc-

Carthy youth activists, McGovern seemed to take pos-

tures which were, if not reprehensible, at least offen-

eemiie   lﬁillage

George McGovern---A Second Loo

sive to many Democrats. By repudiating, or at least
softening, his stances to mollify these people, Mc-
Govern offended the youthful activists whose support
got him the nomination. Yet since during his cam-
paign he made many radical statements as a matter of
record, and which Nixon and Agnew will be able to
skillfully use against him in the same manner that
Goldwater's outlandish pronouncements were turned
against him to such devastating effect in 1964. Mc-
Govern’s chances of mollifying the traditional Demo-
cratic supporters are slim and such attempts at molli-
fication will only lose for McGovern the support of
youthful activists.

A successful Democratic presidential candidate
dedicated to progressive ideals must, before he ever
begins his primary campaign, have some comprehen-
sion of the need to form a viable coalition to achieve
a majority in the general election, and must be suf-
ficiently skilled as a politician to reconcile,‘ as did
Franklin Roosevelt, numerous Democratic factions.
If to achieve this. it is necessary to form temporary
alliance with labor leaders and with the leaders of
local and state Democratic Party organizations, then’
so be it.-

Reform of the Democratic Party apparatus can be
done from the top down once the presidency is secure,
but not before. A dedicated minority in a free repub-
he cannot exercise power successfully unless it can ac-
quire the support of a majority of the people. If to do"
this a liberal candidate must avoid unduly frightening
sizable portions of the people, then that is the course
that must be followed.

Sincere liberals must realize that the lower middle

class and the‘working people and union people are

troubled and affected by that which the liberals consider
the full aspects of America. If the support of these
people is to be acquired, what is needed is a liberal
candidate who can inspire their trust. A candidate who
offends them nonchalantly, or says they’ll have to vote
for him in the end because they won’t vote Republican,
displays aniarrogance that proves he is not fitted for
the presidency. And a candidate who seems to assure
progressive stances to attract youthful activists, then
unshamedly draws back from these stances, shows him-.
self to be an untrustworthy person.

Vets for McGovern

Dear Veterans in College:

The nomination of Senator
George McGovern for the Presi-
dency has been greeted with en-
thusiasm by veterans all over’ the
nation. Letters pledging a willing-
ness to work or financial support
for the campaign have come from
people on active duty in Vietnam,
Germany and bases throughout
the world.

Twenty-five years of prepara-
tions for war have brought ‘to
America ten years of actual war.
The veteran has become the for-
gotten man in this deadly game of
“brinksmanship.” Senator Mc-
Govern’s proposal to reduce de-
fense spending to a reasonable
level and_ to divert our resources
to the more pressingsocial and
economic needs of the American
people- is of great importance to
the veteran.

The legislative record of
George McGovern has reflected a
strong stand for the veterans of
all wars. A decorated combat
vetera_n of World War II, he fav-
ors increases in the GI Bill to
meet the rising costs in education
and extensive government action

‘ in cooperation with private indus-

try to curb the high rate of unem-
ployment confronting today’s vet-
erans. Unlike Richard Nixon, Sen-
ator McGovern does not have a
“secret” plan for peace that has
failed at the expense of over 20,-
000 American lives, countless
more Vietnamese and billions of
dollars. Unlike Richard Nixon,
Senator McGovern would not,con-
tinue to bomb indisciminately, nor
would he bomb at all. The McGov-
ern plan for‘ peace is public, in
keeping with the honor and in-
tegrity of the American people.
The Nixon “game plan” which
equates “peace and prosperity”
with more war, massive bombing,
inflation and greater unemploy-
ment must cease. The veteran
can play a keyrole in restoring
peace and purpose to American
policy at home and abroad; the
election of George McGovern as

President will bring a new and
better government to the Ameri-
can people.

Veterans for‘ McGovern organ-
izations are presently forming
on campuses and in communities
across the country. Working close-
ly with local McGovern for Pre-
sidentoffices, many are still un-
derstaffed and lacking funds. We
encourage and need your sup-
port. If you’re short of time and
money—remember, it takes little
time to register and no money to
vote. If you have problems, ques-
tions or suggestions, feel free to
write or call — we’re here to help

you Out‘ Sincerely yours,

Fee Referendum
Lauded

Editor, The Pitt News:

Holding a referendum on the
activities fee would be an excel-
lent idea. If the students are
forced to pay the fee they should
have the right and be given the-
opportunity to decide whether or
not they want the fee to be levied
upon them. However, if the refer-
endum is to be construed as a val-
id expression of the will of the
students it must be run fairly
from the time the matter is first
brought to the attention of the stu-
dent body through the day of elec-
tion. Unfortunately, the state-
ments made recently by Student
Government chief Bailey demon-
strate that the referendum as
planned is most likely not going to
be conducted in a fair and unbias-
ed manner. 4

As a matter of simple procedur-
al fairness, the referendum
should not be conducted by people
who have already decided and
publicly stated how they feel the
result of the referendum on the
activities fee should turn out. The
Student Government that will run
the referendum has already an-
nounced that it wants the fee to

be kept and that it will use its full

resources on behalf of the reten-
tion of the fee. ‘

But if the result of the referen-

dum is to be considered a legiti-hf;

mate statement of the will of the
student body; then the Student
Government, which has a vested
interest in continuing to make the
students pay the fee (since the
student government is funded by
fee money), should not run the
referendum, or should not splurge
its time, money and resources on
trying to get the students to vote
for the continuation of the Activ-
ities Fee.

Student Government head Bai-
ley has proclaimed, “We would
like to see the fee stay as it is.”
Bailey’s own remark demon-

strates that he and the Student '

Government do not possess the
necessary detachment to conduct
the debate and vote over the fee.

It is one‘ thinggfor the Student
Government to do all in its power
to encourage discussion over the
fee issue. It is another matter for
the Student Government to con-
trive the referendum results to
confirm with their own interests.

In addition, the date of the ref-
erendum, January, 1973, is a very
bad time, and I think the Student

,Government knows it. The refer-

endum vote will come in the mid-
dle of the Student Government

election and will be confused oﬁ‘

tangled ’with it. Also the four

month period for thereferendum A

is much to long. A better date for
the referendum would be in De-
cember before finals. That way
the issue would be settled before
the end of the fall term and before

the election.

If the debate is to be open and
involve the issues vital to the mat-
ter of whether or not the Fee
should be kept, the students must
be permitted to see precisely how
their money is spent. Therefore,
during the debate on the fee, de-
tailed records, not just general

The University of Pittsburgh
Tenant Union has set up the fol-
lowing guidelines to aid students
in understanding their rights and

T responsibilities as tenants.

One of the first problems of
perspective tenants is a holding
deposit. Some landlords demand
money in advance to be used as a
holding deposit before making
available an apartments lease.
This is a legal practice. insuring
the landlords of the genuine inter-
est of those wishing to rent an
apartment. A receipt for a, holding
deposit should always be obtain-
ed, and landlords should specify in
writing what the money will be

(Continued from Page 4)
statements, but detailed records
of exactly how each cent is spent
must be made available to the
students. Thus onlyvcan the con-
troversy over whether or not
the Student Government ‘mis-
spends its money for the personal

. benefit » of Student Government

members be laid to rest once and
for all.

The only way the Activities Fee
referendum can be taken serious-

T‘ {y is for the debate and vote to be

conducted with the utmost in-
tegrity, with all pertinent issues

‘ brought into the open.

 

In Tennessee, the YAF (Young
Americans for Freedom) is suing
in federal court over legality of
students activities fees on the
grounds that it- is unconstitutional.
Even if the transparently contriv-
ed Student Government referen-
dum on the activities fee at Pitt
produces an affirmative vote. fed-
eral courts may declare the fee
illegal.

Once a student obtains a lease,
he should meticulously read all
the print. Because of out-dated
leases still used by some land-
lords, several inequities may ap-
pear on a lease. Examples of
these inequities include clauses
stating that a landlord may by
force recover possession of an
apartment. Any such phrases
which are objectionable to the ten-
ant-should be discussed with the
landlord for possible deletion.
Also discuss any problems such
as pets, date rent is due, or late
fees with the landlord before sign-
ingalease. »

If a landlord promises to do any
work in the apartment. such as
remodeling or repair work. the
agreement should be‘ obtained in
writing. The Tenants Union can do
very little if the landlord has
agreed to do work unless the
agreement is in writing.

A security deposit. usually re-
quired upon paymentgof the first’
month‘s rent, is another possible
problem for tenants. This money
isused against any damage ten-
ants may incur beyond ordinary
use of the apartment. The deposit
is either a set amount or the
equivalent of one months’ rent.
A receipt of the security deposit
should be kept to insure recovery

of this money after tenancy is
completed;

Once living in an apartment,
tenants often discover that the

heating system is poor, insuffi-_

cient hot water is supplied, or
that fire hazards or broken win-
dows are evident. The landlord
should be informed of such prob-
lems immediately.

Rent payments should notgbe
stopped because a landlord has
been negligent is making repairs.
The landlord may start eviction
procedures if rent payments are
withheld and the law sides with
the landlord. Either call the Ten-
ants Union or the Board of Health
for assistance with negligent re-
pairs in an apartment.

The Board of Health’will deter-
mine eligibility for rent witholding
according to their own standards
on heating, plumbing. rodents. or
fire hazards. The Board will in-
form tenants when withholding
eligibility is determined and rent
should be placed in escrow at Mel-
lon Bank. The landlord has no
claim to money placed in escrow
until at least 90 per cent of re-
pairs are made in the apartment
within a specified period of time.

The Tenant Union is available
at 682-1557 to assist students with
landlord. rent or tenancy prob-
lems.

Members of the Oakland Co-op have scheduled several -benefits
and meetings during the next few weeks in an attempt to begin rebuild-
ing the store which was heavily damaged by fire on Aug. 22. The fire
destroyed approximately two-thirds of the store's merchandise and did

considerable damage to the facilities located at 3601 Blvd. of the Allies.‘
The Co-op carried approximately $30,000 worth of fire insurance, '

but the management does not expect to collect the full amount. The C0-
op also carried insurance to compensate workers who were temporari-
ly laid off because of fire, but who will be expected to return to work in
the future.

The Co-op is owned and operated by a group of shareholders who’ T
each have an equal vote in its operation. Anyone may shop at the store, ’

but at the end of the year members receive a rebate for the goods they
purchased. Members are also eligible for exclusive specials.

A meeting of members and interested parties has been scheduled
for 7 p.m. Sept. 20 at the United Associated City Ministries. Paula
Pelham, a Co-op member and employee. hopes that the meeting will

serve to “redifine our purpose and tell us where to go from here. We-

must decide whether we should reopen the general and the food store.”

Pelham reports that members also are considering opening a
crafts and artisan co-op and a trucking co-op. The members have al-
ready initiated a bulk buying program.

The Co-op is selling $5 shares to interested parties. “We need ’peo- I-in
ple and energy badly,’_’ Pelham said. A benefit performance by panto-,

minist Dan Kamin has been scheduled at the Pittsburgh Playhouse at 8
p.m. Oct. 6 and 7. Proceeds will be used to rebuild the operation.

Persons interested in participating in the Co-ops program should‘

Call 621-1233.

ATTENTION SENIORS:

Seniors who intend to enter graduate school in the
Fall of 1973, and 'who are interested in pursuing national

fellowships, should make an appointment with Ms. P'at
Roberts, Graduate Fellowship Advisor, University Counsel-
ing Service, 205 Schenley Hall.

In general, 3.0 is the minimum acceptable Q.P-.A. for
lesser known fellowships while 3.75 is required for fellow-
ship such as the Rhodes and Marshall.

A Problem,A Friend, A Friend, And. an xlunkie

 

by VINCE DiNARDO

Imagine a person depriving
himself of the necessities and
pleasures of life: eating, sleep-
ing, the capacity to have sex.
How about not being able to
pass urine or control one’s bow-
els? Impractical?

The latest statistics show that
600,000 young American men and
women! voluntarily chose that
course last year — there are that
many ‘junkies’ in our country

‘ today.

This particular story is about
one of those junkies. Not any
junkie, but one which shall be

' called a friend. A friend whom I
found under most unusual cir-
cumstances-.

Everyone has heard the scare
talk about narcotics—about be-

If I ing hooked. Imagine the differ-
_---ence. between hearing and ex-
‘ perience. There is a difference.

The words of Neil Young come

i . across much clearer after experi-

ence. .
Solving the mysteries of the
junkie, as yet, seems far from

T attainable, but understanding a

friend in trouble is.
4 “I’m not the typical junkie,”
I this friend said once. “I’m not

your‘, ordinary neighborhood drug
n addict.”

Could a drug addict have a high
QPA at a local college? You
wouldn’t think that a junkie
could talk about the relativity
theory as if it were a household
topic—truly an unusual friend.

Under the influence of junk‘

however, he was transformed into
a stereotype, much like everyone
else in his boat. When ‘high’, he
nodded off, had to go through
withdrawal, and had tracks like
his 599,999 counterparts.

“I was in a position where I
couldn’t cope with the routine
hassles of life. For the most part.
I don’t get along with people.
For me, drugs was the out.”

It didn’t take long for this
friend to find out what kind of
‘out’ he was in.

“In a junkie’s life, the only
thing that matters is junk. You
wake up in the morning and from
then on your whole day is dedi-
cated to getting off. You go out
looking for junk, you cop, and
then you get high.”

The next thing you know. a
new day is in the offing.

“I was way ahead of my time,”
he cooly said once, “I was do-
ing drugs back in the days when
nobody knew anything about
them. ‘

"1 don’t believe that you pro-
gress from grass to the higher
drugs. That’s bullshit. I couldn’t
get off on grass. I tried acid.
but shooting up though, I could
get off in a second."

Getting off means nodding
off. Nodding off is one of the
most disgusting things that can
happen to a human being. Nod-
ding off—sitting there, after the
drug takes effect, fully awake
with eyes closed. Not caring.
How do you reason with a per-
son that is nodding off?

Do you threaten? "Okay this
is the last time. .That’s cool. the
last time." Do you leave? ‘I
wonder what’s happening to him?
Is he OK? Do you turn him in?
"I remember waking up in jail
once and I said to myself, ‘What
am I doing here? What did I do?” ‘

This comrade was not hooked
on heroin, as everyone might
think. He loved something much
more potent, dilaudid (pronounc-
ed dellotta). ’ I

What is dilaudid? Try this one
on for size.

“It’s a painkiller. They give it

to people with terminal diseases
and you can’_t imagine the relief
it gives a person who can’t cope

with hassles.”
Understand?

But every junkie that shoots
up must endure the junkie course.
withdrawal. Withdrawal is com-
ing down, leaving the effect of
the drug behind. Another un-
pleasant sight, for withdrawal is
just plain being sick. Vomit, ten-
sion, more junk or back to.the
once escaped reality. The only
solutions to withdrawal is either
a straightjacket or more junk.

They say that every profession
has its identifying traits. Tracks.
the marks of the needle, are their
identification marks. After a
while. it is harder for a junkie
to find an available vein than it
is to find a needle in a hay-
stack——no pun intended.

‘So where are you different
from other junkies friend._ You
sit there with that pill, grind it
up with the edge of the can
opener, dilute it with water and
shoot it into your vein with that
26‘/2 guage syringe. Where are
you different?’

After being in every hospital
in the Pittsburgh area for‘ rea-
sons ranging from overdoses to
getting beat up to an abscess on
the arm, this friend proved he
was different indeed.

"I don’t know if I can do it.
but I want to try." he said ex-
plaining his desire to overcome
his troublesome hassles.

“Drug rehabilitation centers
don’t work for me. They give you
that ‘dumb junkie’ line and all
I want to say is fuck you.

I know that the longer you stay
off the shit the easier it is to
make it. That’s what I am going

time with his family, watching

day he would like to have a place
out in the country and swim and
sail to his heart’s content. Away
from depressing people.

But, it is noteworthy that this

fore the stuff popped up again.

A 500 year old ceiling collapses on screen. summarily disposing ot
the President‘"of the U. S.. the Speaker of the House. and a clutch
of less luminous unfortunates.

Apparently Henny Penny was right. Meanwhile, a stroke-rid-

den Vice President (Lew Ayres) affirms the inability to assume the '

chief executive position (all due lack of respect to Spiro). A jang—
ling phone rouses the next survivor on‘ the totem. the President Pro
Tempore of the Senate . . .

Ecce Homo: behold The Man, cinematic transcription of Irving
Wallace’s puerile (though cash register ringing) novel. By now
this Irving ranks (indeed!) as the most celebrated literary charla-
tan this side of Clifford, raking in reams of folding stuff for rights
to transfer to celluloid such literary "giants” as The Seven Minutes.
Yet the hack remains unsatisfied—andcontinues to chop away: any
effort with characters in search of (or finding) authors of this calibre

begins with one strike.

And even the usually competent Rod Sterling here churns out
an ultimately exorable script. Of course, a complete cipher provides
little space for creativity. But first things first. For, returning mo-
mentarily to the plot, ladies and gentlemen, James Earl Jones is
Douglass Dilman, the first black PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES! Is he a viable political figure. . . or merely a figure-
head? A Shuffler or a stomper? Tune in and see. Perhaps it would
be preferable to turn on the TV and drop out of the theater, while
strike two slips through. '

Surprise!
the lure of box office receipts waxed all too tempting. And also,’
the victims pay their money and are left with little choice.

What semblance of dramatic tension there is exists only in
spurts, presumably intended to lead up to commercials. The latter
would probably prove more entertaining, and certainly infinitely
more edifying. Any resemblance to characters acceptable as living
or dead is usually coincidental.

Jones steadily gains a measure of assurance in his role, as the
character progresses similarly. But Burgess Meredith spits out a
stereotyped performance as the token Southerner, sneering. “The
White House don't seem near white enough for me tonight.”

As the first family (a daughter), Janet McLachian glances
about haplessly in hopes of a quick exit. Ditto the audience, while
the President snatches command during a press conf'erence, and
defends an American black accused of attempting to assassinate
the South African Defense Minister—simultaneously lambasting that
nation’s racial policies.

V And you can’t shut it off, either. Where have you gone, Stan

sial? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you. But -this version of
The Man sports neither Cardinal uniform nor appropriate clout, and
strikes out. ignominiously. All concerned are hereby instructed to

Having sweated through the collective heat and ener-
gy of almost 14.000 people at the Stones concert in July.
I felt myself capable of surviving anything. ,
But the enthusiasm. the excitement. and the sheer
- power of the Kinks,Argent show last Friday (Sept. 1)
"surpassed anything the Stones had to offer. The Mosque
didn't sell out—only about 2.500 were there—-but if a re-
peat performances were to be scheduled. word of mouth
could sell out the Arena.

They tossed a coin to see who would go first. and Ar-
' gent won lost (depending on your viewpoint). They were
_ in fine form: Rod Argent-—his thick blond mop hiding his
face as he worked out over the organ. showing why he is
the group's guiding force.

Lead guitarist and vocalist Russ Ballard was bril-
liant—one of the few guitarists able to play an intricate
riff and still sing. Especially good was his own composi-
tion, “Liar,” the song originally covered by Three Dog
Night, but not nearly as excitingly as the original.

"Stepping Stone“ (not the Monkees' song) opened the
show. and set the pace for all that followed. "Rejoice."
' from/their second album. came next. then their current
hit single. "Hold Your Head Up.“ which brought the audi-
ence to its feet. clapping along.
"Fakir" was drummer Bob Hendrit's chance to shine.

bals. sweat streaming down his face.

Kinks Argent Show Surpasses

 

Jim Rodford, the bassist, provided an excellent coun-
terpoint throughout the set, the solidarity of his presence
effectively balancing Argent’s frenetic electric piano and
Ballard’s Roger Daltry-type antics with his guitar.

After a rousing ‘‘Tragedy'‘ and "Sweet Mary”
(showing how well they bridge the gap between heavy and '
pop rock) they tried to leave. but the standing audience
wouldn’t allow it. So they returned for a rousing foot-
stomping "Boney Maronie." with all of us singing along.

Setting up for the Kinks took too long. but the wait
gave us a chance to catch our breath and recuperate a bit
before Ray Davies and Company would come out to batter
our minds and ears. -

But the pause, it wasn’t long enough. Bursting out
with “Top of the Pops,” they rocked their way through
“You're Lookin’ Fine,” “Little Queenie” (with appropri-
ate campy gestures from Ray), and “Be Boppa Lula,” go-
ing from one to another with scarcely room for breath.

Ray was in a fine fettle. The gap between his front
teeth mildly reminiscent of comedian Terry-Thomas. he
looked and acted determinedly unhip. unworldly and quite
fey in his white bells. a blue and purple flowered shirt. red
plaid bow tie. toast and white checkered jacket and brown
loafers. Definitely stylish.

The accent in the act is on vamp. Ray swished
around the stage. though he is definitely not gay. swig-
ging beer out of can after can of Budweiser. christening
the majority of each can over those of us in the front. Yet

he also quite generously handed about a dozen cans out.
(He gave me one. but the guy next to be grabbed and drank
it before I could get a swallow.)

“Dedicated Follower of Fashion,” “Sunny After-
noon,” and—of course-“Lola,” featured audience sing-
alongs, accompanying Ray’s beer splashing and some
rather unfriendly epithets regarding the “shitty sound
system,” and the “fucked up pricks we have for road
managers.”

None of us could see anything wrong with the sound
system; any mike that could still function after having
beer splashed all over it without shorting out is well de-
serving of praise. not blame. However . . .

Ray does have a bit of a reputation for being ignorant
to fellow Kinks (he was deported once for beating up
brother Dave). roadies and people in general (I was re-
fused an interview in no uncertain terms). but I do think
“most of the charges are" groundless.

The show closed with “Dem Bones Gonna Rise‘
Again,” “Baby Face,” “You Really Got Me,” and “All
the Day and All the Night,” all mixed together in a rock-'
ing, joyous lump, Ray camping all over the place and all
of us singing along—carried to an even higher- high than
Argent had taken us.

Ray even dragged Jim Rodford and his bottle of
Strawberry Hill out to lead us in our singing.

After almost five minutes of a steihding ovation. Ray
deigned to return and to a "Louie Louie","Hang on
Sloopy“ medley. He actually turned "Louie” into a good
rock and roll number. But all good things must end.’ and
the cops chased us out. exhausted from one magnificent

With the snap of a ‘wishbone
Florida State football coach Larry
Jones’ greatest wish for his de-
fensive unit may be realized in
tomorrow afternoon’s game — that
wish being for the return of a
healthy crew of defenders to
match last year’s Seminoles.

During the ’71 campaign FSU
was‘ tied for the eleventh position
in the nation in scoring defense.

The Seminoles were able to
confine ‘their opponents to an

average of 11.7 points per game. ’

No team that they confronted
collected more than 18 points

and four were not able to reach
double figures.

Prospects for another outstand-
ing.season for the defense could
be a wish come true if FSU can
stay healthy.

“To be as good or better than
we were in 1971, we have to
come up with some depth and
stay reasonably healthy through-
out the year,” stated the Florida
State mentor.

During fall grid drills no real
insurmountable problems have
arose to threaten this prospect.

The only major injury to the
FSU defenders has been with
Clint Parker, the team’s, defen-
sive signal caller. Last week dur-
ing practice Parker suffered a
torn knee ligament. He has un-

"5 dergone an operation and will

be out for the rest of the season.

For the past three years Park-
er has been invaluable to the
Seminoles. He is considered to
be the best pass defender among
the linebackers and last season
he made two interceptions. Park-
er is also believed to have “out-

/{Tomorrow Afternoon

A ‘Good Look’ At Medwid

, By VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

The most important force in a team using the
Wishbone-T offense is the quarterback. For he is
the man that has to read the defenses, call the play
after the ball is snapped, take hard punishment
that is due him, on the way to fame and glory.
A Jack Mildren, a Tom Parr (Colgate), a Bob Med-
wid.

Bob Medwid will be the Pitt man of the hour
tomorrow as the Panthers open their season against
Florida St. at 1:30 P.M. ‘

Medwid is the tough, durable quarterback, who I

an run with the _football and make Carl DePas-

P "qua’s Wishbone go.

With his angelic face and sheepish smile, Bob
Medwid doesn’t look like a tough guy who will
probably get hit on every offensive play. His very
appealing loolgs, which probably serve Bob well
socially, won’t help him on the football field-against
teams that will be seeking his blood, instead. But,
fortunately Medwid will wear a helmet and face-

‘ guard tomorrow, which will make him ‘look as

mean as anyone else.

These things aside, Bob Medwid can det'inte-
ly handle the job of running an option filled of-
fense. He is slick on taking the handoffs, he can
pass, and, most important he can run. He has
even been compared to Mildren, though undesir-
ingly. » _ .
“I think it’s quite an honor being compared to
an athlete of Mildren’s caliber,” he said; “But I
would much rather not be compared to anyone.
I would like to be known for my own abilities
and as myself.” /-

Barring comparisons, Medwid let it be known
last year who he was. He made it clear that_he
could both pass and run the football, the latter ex-
tremely well. P

Stepping in at the Boston College game and
continuing to the Syracuse game, where he was
hurt and lost for the season with a broken collar-
bone, the 6’21/2” Sto-Rox graduate ran, passed, and
returned kickoffs rather well. So well that Carl

DePasqua must have had him in mind when he

decided on the wishbone.

Medwid was the fourth best Pitt rusher last
year. He marched 48 times for 220 yards, a 4.5_

‘ per average, and two touchdowns. Passing, he

completed 18"of 39 tries, with four interceptions
and two touchdowns. He had a .46 per cent com-
pletion percentage. - ‘

He also ran back? 5 kickoffs for 101 yards (20.2) .

“I think we’ll be ready for Florida State,” said
Medwid after a daily practice. “Even though
we’ve looked ragged, we’re getting it down now.

“I have the confidence to do it, and we have
the running backs. to do it. I’d like to do to Flori-
da State what Oklahoma did to us last year. Sur-
prise them. They’ll have to defense us and that
could work to our advantage.”

lWith his brown hair hanging from the back of
the helmet, Medwid will walk up to center Tony
Kuzneski, put his hand on the small of Tony’s
back look over the situation before going about
demorilizing Florida State.

If all goes well, the opposing linemenwill be
trying to figure out which way Bobby will go and
will be too confused to check under his helmet to
.see if he is attractive to the opposite sex or not.

“* Women Schedule IM Program

This term will kick-off a long-
awaited women’s intramural
sports program here at Pitt.

program.

head of Pitt’s entire intramural

leyball, swimming, touch foot-
ball, and paddleball.

It is designed to parallel the
men’s program, and the women’s
sports will include softball, ten-'

’ nis, badminton, soccer, swimming,

fencing, basketball, paddleball,
squash, and volleyball. The in-
tramural schedule will run through-
out the year, with each sport in
turn taking the spotlight.

Director of women’s intramur-
als is Marlene Garone. an un-
dergraduate physical education
major. She has been working in
collaboration with Leo Bemis,

Garone‘ explained that, “Prior
to this year, there has been no
organized full-scale women’s pro-
gram on the intramural level. With
the help of funds provided to us
by the athletic department, we
hope to successfully launch this
women’s intramural sports pro-
gram that has been long overdue.”

Women’s divisions will consist
of dorms, sororities, and inde-
pendent teams. In addition to the
men’s and women’s programs, a
co-ed intramural program will
be started and will include vol-

Garone stressed that the focus
of the women’s program is to get
all women who are interested in
sports involved. “Girls who like
a particular sport, yet question
their ability on a varsity level,
now have an option open to them.”

Application forms for the pro-
gram and the intramural sports

All-American candidate Charlie
Hunt is.another excellent per-
former who lends great speed to

it his special business to get to

Bobby Anderson and ‘Big’ How-

Another All-American candi-

Last season Thomas was at

Lack Of Prcictice

Slows Pitt Booters

By RICK EULER

‘ MARSTELLAR '

The two spectres haunting the dreams of every athletic coach

are a reality for soccer coach Leo Bemis.

Injuries and lack of time have suddenly become major facltorsﬂ

as the Panther booters prepare for the ’72 season.

Bemis has lost all four members of his offensive line, at least. _
for the present. Inside forwards Joe Luxbacher and Tony Bolea are 
suffering from a cut knee and a broken thumb respectively, while’ ‘i

wingers Kevin Crowley and Bill Rex are recuperating from opera-
tions. ‘ '
Rex, who had cartilage removed from his right knee, appearslto

be recovering nicely. Unfortunately, Crowley, who tore ankle liga-_

ments, has suffered complications. The incision of his’ operation did
not heal properly, and skin grafts were necessary. As a result, Crow-
ley has been in a cast for nearly three months. :

Bemis is hopeful that all except Crowley will be ready‘ for the 

season opener with Bucknell.

"Still, they won’t be able to scrimmage as much as they should,”
Bemis admitted. ‘ '

These injuries could become critical, considering that time is al_-, ..

ready at a premium for the squad.

“We weren’t able to have any all day practices,” Bemis explain-P 

ed. “_But I am sure’ Bucknell doesn’t have classes for another
week. so they’re probably having two-a-day practices right now.”

Despite the problems facing him, Bemis still sees promise for A .

the coming season. .

“We didn’t suffer that much by graduation,” he pointed out,\
“and I think we have fellows who are ready to move into the vacant = 

positions.” -

The coach was also pleased that all but three members of the‘ 
returning team had been able to run the mile in less than the re-‘

quired six minutes.

"And one of them had just flown in and hadn’t had much
sleep, so I’m not surprised he wasn’t able to make it,” Bemis said.

Also on the plus side is a sturdy defense, sparked by returning

lettermen Len Raffa, Denny Koczak, Denny Kohlmeyer, Gary Mid-

ock, and Fernando Carriquiry. Bemis feels that the loss of Gus Theo-
filos will not be too severe, with juniors Bill Hauc-k and Jerry Lux-

bacher waiting in the wings. Dave Thompson should also provide. 

added strength in the defensive allignment.

In goal, Steve Fibel will vie with Bill Haines, George Hull,
and Jorge Maurer for the starting position.

Bemis is also hopeful that his freshmen will provide competi-
tion for the returning athletes. Highly promising are forward Alan
Jutca and goalie Eric Holt. Also, John Curley, ‘who spent several
years in England and possesses the ability to unload a whistling shot
with either foot, may_be a threat to some varsity player.

Bemis predicted, “I see no reason ‘why we can't expect a win-
ning season right from the start. We might be a little slow rounding
into shape, but we are capable of beating any team on our schedule.” ,

He admitted that the season will not be an easy one.
“Most of the teams on our schedule have improved. We’ll just

have to be the most together outfit on the field. "We don’t have the — I
"big stars, but we have good players and good spirit,” Bemis said.

What started as being a freak-
ish. chance meeting has turned
into a great deal of good fortune
for the University of Pittsburgh
Road Race Team.

It all happened last year at
the American Road Race Cham-
pionship in Atlanta. Georgia.
The cause was a sudden land-
slide. the man who dealt the
fortunes was Mark Donohue.
winner of the 1972 Indianapolis
500.

The meeting took place at the
track ‘motorhome camp where
Donohue was temporarily resid-
ing. It was during the evening
and a constant deluge of rain
was pouring down upon the track.

(SIX curs).

It followed that a ‘landslide

threatened Donohue‘s trailer home.

In need of immediate assistance,
Donahue ran for help at the
nearest campsite which happen-
ed to be Pitt’s Road Race Team
and secured the necessary equip-
ment.

It was here that a close and

Javelin
tained at 12 the original the

extra engine that is an integral
part in modern day racing.

The Javelin wasoriginally the
back-up car used by Donohue
on the Trans-Am circuit and was
brilliantly engineered by Roger
Penske.

After acquiring this present
car. the team went.to work
building and developing what
can now be considered a super-
ior racing machine.

The crew spent an estimated
7.000 hours reconstructing the
car and according to Bob Fryer.
"The team did a great job and I
truly believe that they advanced
the engineering even further
than what Penske was able to
do.“

The improvements built into
the car consist of an entirely
new braking system plus an
equally impressive steering sys-
tem.

Since the Javelin has been in
racing conditions. Fryer has
steered the team to an impressive
record of two wins. one second
and one fourth place finish.

The two wins occurred at the

racetracks in Warren. Ohio. and ‘

Bridgehampton. New York. Co-
incidentall_v. Fryer broke the lap
speed record at Bridgehampton
which was formerly held by
Mark Donohue. ’

At Limerock, Connecticut,
Fryer finished a disappointing
second after qualifying in the
Prized pole position. The car
ran well but lost valuable ground
as it failed to start at the begin-

ning of the race. A push-start

Buy

was necessary.

Finally. last weekend at the
Mid-Ohio Raceway in Lexington.
Ohio. the team was able to sal-
vage a fourth place finish after
some tense moments.

The entire race seemed to
present one problem after an-
other. First. the car came in
20th in the qualifying runs due
to some technical difficulties.
Secondly. the race was held in
a rainstorm and finally there

was some poor driving on the
behalf of an opponent.

The foolish move by one of
Fryer’s fellow drivers caused
the Javelin to spin out of con-
troll into the infield after the
car had reached third place.
Somehow, Fryer was able to
continue the race and was able
to finish in the fourth spot.

The team is now in second
place in their championship
division behind Ed Sullivan of
upper state‘New York.

Fall baseball makes its debut at

p.m.- as head coach Bob Lewis
leads his squad.against a weak
Steubenville College team.

There are five games on the fall
schedule as ofnow, two of which
are home games against perenial—
ly strong Point Park while the re-

confrontation of the two teams
in Ohio will be a ClOUDle-

The Pitt squad racked up a 9-7
record last year. but that was
with the services of Ken Macha.
Mike Niccols and Bob Livingston.
all of whom graduated. However.
Lewis feels that are many ade-
quate replacements waiting for
a chance to prove themselves.

“Niccols’ replacement in the
pitching rotation should be Al Syl-
anski if he is fully recovered from
a sore arm,” said Lewis.

Livingston might not even be
missed with the arrival of Rick

Monroe at second base. "Monroe
shows great potential’ both at the
plate and in the field." said Lewis.
when referring to the powerful
sophomore.

base and Joe Groetch. a return-
ing letterman. at shortstop. Dan-

hitter. Paul Quarantillo (.379) will

leaves Macha’s first base posi-
tion as the only vacant spot in the
infield.
