Pitt researchers develop ﬂu vaccine

By Aimee Wolﬂnger
Sta_ﬂ’Wﬂter

A unique application for a new
inﬂuenza vaccine which is
administered by nasal spray was
announced by researchers from
the University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine on July 9.

The application, announced at
the annual conference of the
American Society for Virology in
Salt lake City, will treat the vaccine
as an antiviral agent that will
immediately guard against any
type-A inﬂuenza virus, while
simultaneously inducing the
formation of antibodies to protect
against future exposure to the
ﬂu.

Researchers Julius Youngner,

Sc.D., distinguished service
professor, department of
molecular genetics and

biochemistry, Patricia Whitaker-
Dowling, Ph.D., associate
professor and William Lucas,
graduate student, collaborated in

Pitt shooting
victim released
from hospital

A Pitt student was released
from an Ocean City, Md., hospital
last week after being critically
wounded last month when a street
argument took a violent turn.

Frank J. Pucciarelli, 19, was
shot in the chest during the
incident. He spent several days in
Peninsula General Hospital’s
intensive-care unit after
undergoing surgery.

Pucciarelli was involved in what
the Ocean Beach Police called a
“brief argument involving two
groups of youths walking on the
beach.”

Two juveniles from Northern
Virginia were arrested after the
OBP apprehended their get-away
car and pursued them on foot for
about 20 minutes. One youth, 17-
year—old Lars Hanson, has been
charged as an adult with the
shooting and is being held in the
Ocean City jail without bond.

the studies.

The vaccine, which was
developed by Professor John
Maassab of the University of
Michigan to protect against
inﬂuenza by formation of
antibodies, is in its attenuated
form.

“An attenuated virus is a living,
weakened virus that is designed
to produce immunity against
inﬂuenza,” said Youngner. “We
found that the weakened virus
interferes with the growth of an
epidemic virus immediately.”

Because the attenuated virus
protects against inﬂuenza during
the incubation period, the first 24
to 48 hours when the virus enters
the body's bloodstream and
mucous membranes, it acts as an
antiviral drug.

According to Youngner, an
antiviral agent inhibits the growth
of any inﬂuenza virus of the
same form. There are two major
forms of viruses that cause the

ﬂu, type A and type B. Type-A

viruses cause the worldwide
epidemics and change quickly,
usually from a year-to-year basis.

A vaccine, on the other hand,
is produced to fight against one
speciﬁc virus. Unlike an antiviral
agent that forms antibodies to
protect against all inﬂuenza
viruses of the same type, a vaccine
can initiate the production of
antibodies to fight against the
specific virus for which it is
administered.

The vaccine that is presently
being used to fight against
inﬂuenza is a dead virus that is
injected by needle. According to
Whitaker-Dowling, both the
injection of a killed virus and the
administration via nasal spray of
the live virus induce the formation
of antibodies. With an injection,
however, antibodies form only
in the blood, and it takes at least
two weeks for a person to build
up immunity.

On the other hand, the nasal
spray initiates the formation of

antibodies in the bloodstream
and the nose. The virus grows
and builds antibodies in the
mucous membranes of the nose,
the passage through which the
diseased virus attacks the lungs
and respiratory system.

In addition, the new attenuated
vaccine begins to work
immediately as an interference
mechanism. “A vaccine is
preventive, but an antiviral drug
has an interference phenomenon
where we may be able to stop
the ﬂu from developing while
it's in the incubation stage,” said
Whitaker-Dowling

“What we envision for the
future is that if you have the ﬂu
and your husband comes home
and gives you a kiss, exposing
himself to the inﬂuenza virus, he
can go to the pharmacy, get the
spray, and stop the spread of the
disease immediately,” she added

However, if the vaccine virus
is not administered during or

Bus lane
sparks
student
concern

By Mindy Boffemmyer
and Jennifer Calabrese
The Pitt News

The reopening of the Fifth
Avenue bus lane has
prompted student concerns
about safety.

“I think it's dangerous
because you are not used to
looking the other way," said
junior Lore Nestel.

A protective railing has
been installed along the bus
lane between Craft Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard, but
according to Debra
DeCourcy, assistant manager
for media relations at Port
Authority Transit, there won't
be a railing in front of the
Cathedral of Learning.
DeCourcy said that PAT
consulted with an Oakland
development group to
determine where the rail
should be installed.

“There isn’t the same
amount of congestion from
Bigelow to Bellefreld as there
is before that [on Fifth
Avenuel,” because there
aren’t any businesses beyond
Bigelow, she said.

Some students disagree.

“I think there should be a
railing [in front of the
Cathedral]. That’s a crowded
section," said senior Maureen
Phelan.

There are safety concerns
beyond the issue of where
railings should be installed.

“Rails or no rails, warning
signs or no warning signs,
people are going to 
inclined to cross without.
looking both ways for the
buses," said Kevin Kearns,
assistant to Pitt President
Wesley Posvar.

“There are so many places
where you can just run
across,” Nestel said.

Paula Roberts, junior, said
she understands the principle
that the ‘railing would stop
you from crossing the street,
but where have they stopped
you from crossing before?’

Several students cited a lack
of safety on the part of PAT

Minorities acquire medical experience

Dana Fernandez
For The Pitt News

For minority students
considering careers in medicine,
the Summer Pre-medical
Academic Enrichment Program
at Pitt exposes them to the
requirements, research and
content of the medical field.

The eight-week program is
directed by Assistant Dean of
Student Affairs, Nancy D.
Washington, Ph.D.; Jerome
Gloster, a third-year medical
studentat Pitt, is the student
coordinator.

1 The program offers a
condensed anatomy course, a
learning-skills" workshop and an
introduction to library and
research-writing skills. The
students are also assigned to a
speciﬁc area of medicine; a doctor
in that particular field works with
the student on a research project,
which they are required to present
a paper on during the last week
of the program. On ' their

applications, students specify
which area of medicine they are
interested in so they can
concentrate on that area as much
as possible.

The students also participate in
a “brown bag lunch” once a week.
They meet for lunch and minority
physicians from the area speak
about their preparations for
medical school and the
experiences that they have had.

The program has been funded
by the Department of Health and

Human Services and by the

Minority High School Biomedical
Research Apprenticeship Program
for the past eight years. Students
are not charged to attend the
summer program, and their travel
and housing expenses are paid
for with these funds if they do not
live in the area.

'6 This year there are 33 students
participating, 17 female and 16
male: 29 African-American
students, one Asian-American,
one Mexican-American, one
Colombian and one Romanian.

Twenty-eight are college
students, some of whom attend
Historic Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU); five are high
school seniors.

Washington said, “Working
with young people is always
exciting, and this particular group
has proven to be stimulating,
challenging and thoroughly
enjoyable.”

Douglas A. Davis, a senior
chemistry major at Lincoln
University, an HBCU attendant
and a third—year participant in
the program, and Schenley High
School senior Shana Renee Payne
both work at the Anxiety
Disorders Clinic at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic;
their preceptors are Deborah C.
Beidel, Ph.D. and Samuel M.
Turner, Ph.D. Davis’ research
consists of comparing levels of
test anxiety in Caucasian and
African-American children in
elementary schools to see if there
is a significant difference in the
two races. Payne is researching

to determine the symptoms that
are found in test-anxious children.

Davis said, “lthinklthe program
is]. excellent for undergraduate
students planning to attend
medical school. You learn
research skills; it helps you to
organize your thoughts for the
MCAT exam, and it helps you
meet good role models."

Any student wishing to apply
for the Summer Pre-medical
Academic Enrichment Program
can send requests for applications
to Nancy D. Washington, Ph.D.,
University of Pittsburgh, School
of Medicine, M-247 Scaife Hall,
Pittsburgh, PA 15261.

Professor-author finds fiction writing a ‘mystery’

Bus

Continued from page 1
Yesterday I was crossing the
street, and a bus went right
through the red light, " said senior
Jeff Yoder.

“I think things will be OK as
long as drivers remember to stop.
Sometimes when it turns red,
they just forget and go through,"
Nestel said.

“I find myself being more
cautious than I think the bus
drivers are,” said Rosemary
Margiotta, a recent Pennsylvania
State University graduate.

DeCourcy said that she is not
aware of any problems or
complaints since the bus lane
reopened on July 15.

“We have people out there
monitoring  monitoring will
continue as long as we feel it is
necessary," she said.

Since PAT announced its
decision on June 1, Posvar has
consistently and publicly
opposed the reopening of the
bus lane.

“He's also made arguments
about the relative efficiency of a
bus lane that runs l...l against
synchronized trafﬁc lanes," said
Kearns.

Kearns said the administration
is concerned for the safety of the
entire community — students,
faculty and visitors.

“There is a special concern for
new students in the fall who
aren’t aware of the bus lanes and
won’t be looking for them.”

For The Pitt News

His desire to write is a mystery
that he cannot solve. Once Pitt
professor Neal Fogarty delves into
writing, he cannot stop.

“Characters and plots come into
my mind sometimes, and I decide
that there has got to be something
I can do with these people,” said
Fogarty.

It all began one winter evening
in a hotel room in Kentucky.
Part-time professor of business
law and self—practicing attorney,
Fogarty sat down at a typewriter,
intending to punch out a short
story. Instead, he produced an
80,000-word mystery novel he
titled, The Mystery of the
Windswept Cruise.

Since that time, Fogarty has
written two other mystery novels,

Call Today for May or Sept. Leasing

369-094

The Mystery of the French Mist
and his newest release, The
Mystery of the Runaway Russian.

Presently, he is working on a
fourth mystery, tentatively titled,
The Mystery of Solomons Sin.
Fogarty has also written a practical
guide for entrepreneurs, titled
Starting a Business in Pittsburgh.

However, Fogarty’s passion lies
in fiction writing. He enjoys being
in control of his characters and
their actions and often allows
himself to become. involved in
their adventures. While he does
not parallel himself to any
particular character in his books,
he does envision himself as his
characters’ “invisible buddy,”
accompanying his characters to
exotic places around the world
and experiencing their adventure
right along with them as he writes.

“When you write,” said Fogarty,

“you have to forget the problems
of everyday living because all of
a sudden, you are living the lives
of the characters.”

All of Fogarty’s novels reflect
his personal love for travel. The
idea for Windswept Cruise was
inspired by his dream to go on a
cruise to the Bahamas. Through
his writing, he was able to
experience that dream. French
Mist has taken him to the French
Riviera and Scotland, while
Runaway Russian has whisked
him off to Russia and Afghanistan.

Another inﬂue nce for his novels
is Fogarty’s interest in politics.
Receiving a political- science
degree and a law degree from
Akron University, and an master’s
degree in political science from

Penn State University, Fogarty
bases his mysteries on
international affairs.

This theme serves as a common
thread throughout his novels, but
the books are not interdependent.
Any one of the novels can be

read independently. Fogarty feels ,

he has successfully crafted a
careful balance of interrelatedness
between his novels and hopes he
can maintain that in the future.

Fogarty admits that he has tried
to emulate his favorite mystery
novelist, Phoebe Atwood Taylor,
by ending each chapter with a
hook.

Fogarty takes pride in the way
he constructs his mysteries. Each
one combines action, adventure,

Flu

Continued from page 1
before the incubation period and
symptoms occur, there is a
minimal chance the virus can be
reversed, Youngner said.

The new vaccine ﬁghts against
any type-A virus. Currently, the
Public Health Authority makes a
yearly decision about what the
epidemic inﬂuenza virus will be
the next winter and then prepares
a vaccine. Since the PHA is
making a guess, the vaccine may
often be incorrect for the ﬂu
virus that is abundant, and the
antibodies the vaccine initiated
will not be able to guard against
the virus.

Because the new vaccine in its
attenuated form fights against all
type-A inﬂuenza viruses, there
will be no need for researchers to
guess the upcoming ﬂu epidemic
for the winter and make a vaccine
that may not be effective. With
the new vaccine, the Public
Health Authority’s guessing game
will be eliminated.

Also advantageous is that the
vaccine virus in the nasal-spray
form should be widely accepted
by the general public because it
is easier to administer and more
accessible.

“The spray is probably more
sterile than using a needle. Plus,
people would rather have a nasal
spray than an injection because it
doesn't hurt,” third-year
pharmacy student Kristin Buss
said.

The discovery that the live
vaccine can be used as an antiviral
agent was observed during
experiments with animals.

In studies done in collaboration
with Maassab, ferrets were
simultaneously infected with a
type-A virus, one that produces
disease, and the vaccine virus.
After infected with the epidemic
virus and the attenuated virus,
the ferrets displayed no symptoms
of the ﬂu and acted as-if they had
received only the vaccine virus.
This paved the way for the idea
of the live vaccine virus as -an
antiviral drug, one that fights
against the inﬂuenza virus
immediately.

“The animals showed no ﬂu
svmptoms when given both the
vaccine virus and the ﬂu virus
simultaneously. They acted as if
they were only administered the
nasal spray,” Whitaker—Dowling
said.

Ferrets were used in the
experiments to determine
whether the vaccine virus is an
antiviral agent because they react
to the ﬂu virus similarly to
humans. They have the same ﬂu
symptoms as ‘humans, such as
fever and runny nose.

“Ferrets are the animal of choice
for a model of inﬂuenza,” said
Youngner. “Researchers have
been using ferrets for testing of
the ﬂu virus for years.”

Human testing for the antiviral
properties of the vaccine will

take place this fall. The testing
will begin in October in
collaboration with physicians in
Rochester, N.Y.

The results of the human trials
will have a great impact on the
treatment of inﬂuenza. At this
time, inﬂuenza is the sixth leading
cause of death in the United
States. Those who are particularly
vulnerable to the ﬂu virus are the
elderly, those with cardiac
problems, lung disease and
emphysema.

The medical world is anxiously
awaiting licensing of the new
attenuated Vaccine virus.
According to both Whitaker-
Dowling and Youngner, the
vaccine should be patented in
the near future.

“The attenuated virus will be
marketed as a vaccine, but we

Paint it orange...

In spite of the safety concerns of Pitt President Wesley
Posvar and others, the Fifth Avenue bus lane reopened
Sunday.

In an effort to make the bus lane more visible, and
therefore safer, Port Authority Transit has posted warning
signs, installed additional railing between Craft Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard, repaved the bus lane and
painted white diamonds on the asphalt. PAT does not,
however, plan to install a railing along the stretch of the
bus lane in front of the Cathedral of Learning. PAT
officials based this decision on the assumption that,
because there are no businesses there, there are fewer
pedestrians. But most of the 28,524 Pitt students utilize

that section of the street every day when school is in

session.

Because the bus lane runs counter to the traffic pattern
on the rest of Fifth Avenue, people may not necessarily
be thinking about “looking both ways before they cross
the street.” Those freshman and transfer students who are
coming to Pitt from suburban or rural areas or from cities
in which the bus routes are established on the basis of
logic are especially likely to be confused by the bus lane
in Oakland.

The principle behind repaving the bus lane was to make

it stand out against the other traffic lanes on Fifth Avenue. .

But making the asphalt on the bus lane a different shade
of black may prove to be too subtle a difference to
prevent further injuries and fatalities.

The city of Pittsburgh should force PAT to paint the bus
lane another color, like the ﬂorescent orange used for the
warning signs that line the sidewalk, in order to make it
easily distinguishable from the rest of Fifth Avenue. This
gesturewould eliminate the confusion that caused the
death of  and others.

Collider isn't Worth the money

Five billion dollars  What could a normal,
everyday person like you or me do with five billion
dollars? Well, for starters we could buy 162,601
BMW 325i’s —— with full options — and drive one
a day for the next 445 years.

Or, being slightly more generous, we could give
$20.32 to every man, woman and child in the United
States. Or, in order to solve the problem of the
homeless, we could give each homeless person in
the United States almost $1,700. Any of these things
would be more practical than the proposed super
collider which the U.S. House of Representatives
voted 309 to 109 in favor of funding.

Physicists claim that the new collider is necessary

in order to discover even smaller pieces of matter,

and that it will eventually aid them in discovering
many other significant things, such as what exactly
happened in the beginning, when the universe was
forming. .

The whole theory behind a

the existing super colliders. These inﬁnitesimally
small particles include: electron neutrinos, muons,
muon neutrinos, taus, up quarks, down quarks,
charms, stranges, gluons and intermediate vector
bosons.

The April 16 issue of Time magazine has a
section devoted to the super colliders that are in
existence and the aforementioned particles. In
their attempt to explain these tiny particles of
matter, they failed to tell me, the reader, just what
exactly any of these things are.

So let’s think about this project. The House of
Representatives has approved a HUGE sum of
money in order for some scientists to go play in the
lab and try to ﬁnd smaller particles of matter, while
a majority of the people on the street have no idea
what half of them are or do. And politicians seem
to think it's a great idea.

I love science as much as
anybody else, but there are a

super collider is in its design.
The new super collider in Texas
will be 54 miles in circumference.
Protons (one of the particles of
matter that most people know of

few more practical applications
for the $5 billion price tag that
looms over the advancement of
science. Not only does this
obligate the United States to fund

and understand) will be launched
into the circle that makes up the
collider. These particles will be accelerated by
electromagnets to speeds close to and exceeding
that of light. Since electrons and protons attract
each other, the protons will be dragged along at
high speeds, so that when the protons collide, they
create tiny ﬁreballs over 400 million times hotter
than the sun. These super-heated conditions are the
basis for what happened 15 billion years ago that
gave birth to the universe and everything in it.

In their quest for understanding, I believe that the
scientists planning this monumental project have
overlooked the practicality of it. It would be a
marvelous thing for us to be able to look back to
when it all started (if it did indeed start the way that
scientists claim) and understand the complex
interactions that occurred.

On the other hand, why not put it off for a few
years and take care of issues that are more important
to a larger portion of the public? Spending huge
amounts of money on the advancement of science,
instead of concentrating on domestic problems, is
a serious issue that many politicians and scientists
are unwilling to face. We must realize that the
consequences of such a monumental project could
be equally monumental.

I decided to take a survey of some of my friends
as to what the smallest pieces of matter are. I, got the
same three answers over and over again: electron,
proton, and neutron. Some may say that I asked the
wrong people, but in this group were two engineers
and three chemistry majors.

None of these people named any of the particles
that scientists are searching for through the use of

‘$5 billion, but the state of Texas
alone has to come up with $1
billion. The real question is, where is the
government going to come up with the money?
Looking at it more realistically, we could do a lot
of other things with the money. For starters, we
could research a way to get rid of all the toxic waste
that is lying around the country. Or, we could put
more money into medical research for AIDS and

cancer. An even more novel idea is to just put the 

money in the bank. We could get a good deal, say
8.5 percent interest, and in eight years we would
have  $14.5 billion. WOW!!!

As the government continues in its attempts
(however feeble they may be) at reducing the
deficit, politicians must think about spending. At
about the same time that George Bush is telling us
“no new taxes," the House of Representatives is
appropriating money that neither they nor we
have. The real question here is that of priorities.

If the government is going to continue to spend

money that could be better used elsewhere, then 1*‘

they had better be prepared to answer for it. “No
new taxes” rings too good to be true, but if you
think about it, there are already enough taxes in
existence, which, if raised high enough, could fund
this project.
I would like to learn more about the beginning
of the universe, but I think there are domestic
issues that are more important. Before we agree to
‘root the bill, let’s talk things over and be a little
more practical. And remember people, elections“
aren’t that far away

Oxymorons.

The world is full of them.

No, not a, bunch of fools
addicted to a certain brand of
acne cream. Rather, oxymorons

are a combination for
epigrammatic effect of
contradictory or incongruous
words.

At least, that’s how Webster’s‘

Third deﬁnes them. If only Noah
Webster spoke English.

Perhaps you know them better
as “cruel kindness,” or “strange
resemblance,” or maybe even as
“civil war” and “military
intelligence.” Yeah, you got it,
short phrases whose words
contradict each other.

On today’s campus the title of
“student-athlete" is viewed,
perhaps too often, as a sports-
related oxymoron.

Taking that example a step
further, how about a quarterback-
crushing medical student?

Do visions of a mountainous

The Pitt women's basketball
team had its first winning season
in five years in 1989-90 with a 15-
14 record and a spot in the Big
East tournament semi-finals.

Head Coach Kirk Bruce used
his best recruiting class ever to
build whatlooks to be a promising
future for Lady Panther basketball.

Each of the five freshmen was
valuable to Pitt's successful
season. Maureen McConnell and
Jill McElhinny started every game;
Turia Ransom, Lisa Fessler and
Tiffany Fingers saw a considerable
amount of time off the bench.

Bruce has assembled a
recruiting class for next season
which will be comparable to last
years. Two local recruits areJonna

Jimmy Johnson has a dilemma
on his hands in Dallas. He has
two Cadillacs sitting in his garage,
but he can only drive one at a
time. Either car may get him
where he eventually wants to go
(the Super Bowl), but for now, it
is not economical to pay for two
vehicles. Johnson has to give one
of them up so he can afford to
have certain other luxuries.

Johnson got his first Cadillac in
the form of UCLA quarterback
Troy Aikman; the first overall
pick in the 1989 draft. While

Johnson entertained many

lucrative offers for the first pick,
he decided to keep it and go for
the “franchise quarterback” when

he had the chance. The Cowboys -

then decided to build their team"

and then applying a cast to the
poor fella’s collarbone enter your
mind?

Well, that could be the case for
the Gladiators’ T om Gizzi in the
near future.

Gizzi, a University of
Pennsylvania graduate, leads the
Arena Football League in sacks
this year, and also plans on
entering medical school in the
Fall.

He had one sack in the
Gladiator’s 27-24 win over the
Albany Firebirds last Saturday,
and had another taken away
because of a penalty.

Medicine has been an interest
of Gizzi’s for a long time, maybe
even longer than football.

“I’ve always wanted to go [to
medical schooll,” said Gizzi. “I
want to study sports medicine. I
know that’s kind of general; it
can range from physical therapy
to orthopedic surgery. I'm not
sure which direction I want right
now. I’ll just take some core
courses and then choose, but
right now I’m leaning toward
physical therapy.”

See Gizzi, page 10

Huemrich of Bethel Park and
Janine Joyce of Penn Hills.

“Both of them will make an
immediate impact,” he said.

Huemrich was a 6—foot forward
at Bethel Park High School, but
maybe moved to a guard position.
Pitt has one of the best transition
games in the Big East with
McConnell at point guard.
Although she doesn’t favor a faster
style of play, Huemrich feels she
can fit in at Pitt.

“At Bethel, we’d mix it,” she
said. “We’d try to run but if we
didn’t have the fast break we
would pull it back and set it up.
It was a smart type of basketball.
I don’t like to totally run—and-
gun. I always play smart
basketball. There are girls from
Pitt who are quick and I like that
style if it is successful. But I don’t

around Aikman.

Then, during the 1989
supplemental draft, Johnson had
the opportunity to pick Steve
Walsh, his former college QB at
Miami. With little hesitation, he
selected Walsh, forfeiting the
Cowboys’ first-round pick in the
1990 draft. Johnson was figuring
that he would deal Walsh to the
highest bidder. He thought the
Cowboys could get the kind of
package deal much akin to what
the Atlanta Falcons received from

the Indianapolis Colts for Jeff

George. However, he was wrong.

Since the Cowboys have been
unable to move Walsh, and lost
the rights to the first selection of
the ’90 draft, Johnson has been
openly criticized by the media,

like to just run—and—gun all the
time.”

“She can rebound and run the
floor,” said Bruce. “She is a good
defensive and offensive player.
She can go both ways.”

Huemrich is familiar with some
of the Pitt players and recruits.
She is on the regional AAU
(Amateur Athletic Union) All-Star
team along withjoyce and fellow
Pitt recruit Erin Malloy. She also
played with and against
McConnell in high school all-star
games.

“I’m glad they Uoyce and
Malloyl are coming to Pitt,” said
Huemrich. “It’s good. They will
be freshmen too. It will help.”

Huemrich is playing in several
summer leagues in preparation
for the upcoming season,
including the AAU squad which

5 Johnson should move Aiknlan

which has labelled the Walsh
pick a total blunder. Johnson,
however, could not foresee the
Cowboys going 1-15 in 1989 and

" having the first pick in 1990. NFL

draftnik Mel Kiper said, “I doubt
the Cowboys will ever get equal

value to what they lost [for
Walshl.” '

Last season, both quarterbacks
took their share of lumps at the
helm of the Cowboy offense.
Although Aikman edged Walsh
statistically,. Walsh led the

is currently in Chattanooga, Tenn.
(July 5-14). She was named
national AAU most valuable
player last year in the annual
AAU tournament in West Virginia.
No matter what style Pitt
implements next year, and it
promises to include a running
style, Huemrich feels she will
have no problem fitting in.

“I’ve played on a lot of different
all-star teams. I think I can adjust.
It has usually turned out pretty
well on other teams in the past. I
know it’s going to be a lot
different. It’s going to be a lot
harder."

Bruce is not sure exactly where
Huemrich will be used, but he
knows she can play forward,
where she played in high school,
and feels she has the attributes
for a good swing player.

“I can see Jonna, before she
leaves Pitt, playing guard,” he
said. I ’

Bruce acquired an excellent
outside shooter inJoyce. She is S-
feet-9—inches tall and has played
guard virtually all of her life. She
had to play some forward for
Penn Hills High School this past
season, but adjusted well enough
to lead her team to the
Pennsylvania state championship.

Joyce scored a career high 27

points in the game.

“I’ve played outside ever since
I was little,” said Joyce. “I play a
three [wing guard]. This past year
I had to play four [power forward] A
because we were short on fours.
That was a factor in recruiting.
They wondered if I could shoot

Cowboys to their only win of the
season, a 13-3 thrashing C?) of
Washington.

Neither quarterback should be
judged by the Cowboys’ poor
showing last year. The offensive
supporting cast was in disarray
the entire year: Herschel Walker

was traded to the Vikings after 1

the fifth game; the Cowboys’ best
receiver, Michael Irvin, did not
play after being injured in week
six, and their leading receiver,
Kelvin Martin, missed the last
five games due to injury.

With Walker gone, the
Cowboys’ running game was
virtually nonexistent Also, Dallas
was always behind in games last
year. These two factors allowed
opponents to play pass defense

for the entire game arid"
the Cowboy air attack helpless.
Since Johnson realizes that a
quarterback’s success largely
depends on his supporting cast,
he has tried to improve the
Cowboys’ offense with the draft,
Plan-B: free agents and trades.
In round one of this year's
draft, the Cowboys selected
Emmitt Smith (RB, Florida) to
improve the ground attack. In
round two, they chose speed
merchant Alexander Wright (WR,
Auburn). They traded with the
San Francisco 49ers for RB
Terrence Flagler who, at times,
has shown ﬂashes of brilliance.

playing inside.”

The power forward position
also reduced the amount of times
Joyce handled the ball. But Bruce
was convinced she could shoot
from the outside and handle the
ball, and would fit into the Lady
Panther’s scheme.

“Janine is one of the best three-

‘ point shooters in the state,” Bruce

said. “We have McConnell and
Fessler, who can shoot the three-
pointer, but you can never have
enough three-point shooters."
Joyce originally gave a verbal
commitment to Siena, but a
coaching change left her in doubt
over whether she would get the
kind of playing time she desired.
That's when Bruce and his youth
movement stepped in and
convincedjoyce to sign a letter of
intent at Pitt.
“I’ve seen the men’s games
and the packed Field House and

always wanted to go there," she
said.

Bruce was not speciﬁc as to
what Joyce's exact role will be
this coming year, but he knows
she will fit into his game plan
nicely. '

“Janine is a versatile player.
She can be used when we go to
a three-guard line up. She can
also play the two—guard [shooting
guard] spot."

Joyce knows she can be a key
player at Pitt as a freshman. “I
hope. That would be nice. If I go
in there and improve myself, it
depends on me.”

Like Huemrich,Joyce is playing
in summer leagues and has also
played alongside some of the
Lady Panthers. “I know a lot of
them, Maureen, Fessler, Connie
[Hurt]. Erin and Jonna and I have
played together with AAU and I
practiced with Lisa and Maureen.
I think we are going to be strong.”

Rams).

Since the Cowboys cannot get
what they want for Walsh in a
trade, they should move Aikman
while his stock is still at its peak.
If Walsh plays and gains
experience, he will develop into
a QB that the Cowboys can win
with. The knock that most teams
have on Walsh (6—foot-2, 200) is
his lack of arm strength. Aikman
(6-4, 220) has the stronger arm.
However, just how important is
that? John Elway has a stronger
arm thanJoe Montana, but it sure
didn’t help Denver in last year’s
Super Bowl. “[A quarterback’s
success] really depends on your
supporting cast,” said Cleveland
Browns’ vice president Ernie
Accorsi.

“It is a good situation for the
Cowboys,” said N.Y. Jets general
manager Dick Steinberg, “to have
two good, young quarterbacks.
Aikman has tremendous arm

strength and physical ability.

When he develops, he will be
one of the best in the league.
Walsh is very smart, and an
excellent leader that you can win
with," Steinberg said.

“The Walsh situation has been
highlighted by the fact that the
Cowboys lost the first pick in this
year’s draft, “ said N.Y. Giants
G.M. George Young. “They took
Walsh because they knew him,
had faith in him, and he was a
winner. Who knows? Walsh could
end up being a better quarterback
than Aikman. Anything is possible
at this point,” Young said.

If Aikman were to be put on
the market, more than one team
would submit a high bid for him.
For one, the L.A. Raiders would
like to improve their passing
game. Al Davis is tired of watching
the ineptitude of quarterbacks
Jay Schroeder and Steve
Beuerlein. Aikman would be able
to get the ball deep to the Raiders’
speedy core of receivers.

The Kansas City Chiefs feel
they will contend for the AFC
Western Division crown this year
and have visions of the playoffs
dancing in their heads. However,

Pelluer, Steve De Berg and Mike
Elkins collectively at the QB
position. Aikman could be the
missing piece to Kansas City’s
Super Bowl puzzle.

The New England Patriots are
also looking for quarterback help.
Going into this year’s draft, they
were rumored to be working out
a deal with the 49ers for Steve
Young. Everyone is eagerly
anticipating the preseason duel
between senior citizens Steve
Grogan and Marc Wilson to see
who will be the Patriots’ starting
QB. Aikman would be a great
complement to a receiving corps
that includes Hart Lee Dykes,
Irving Fryar, Cedric Jones and
Greg McMurtry.

Who knows, maybe even
Indianapolis Colts G.M. “Jump
on Any Deal” Jim Irsay would be
interested in Aikman. The Colts
love collecting, “franchise
quarterbacks,” and he would fit
in nicely with Jeff George, Chris
Chandler and Jack Trudeau.
Certainly, the Cowboys would
give up Aikman for, say, Eric
Dickerson, all-pro center Ray
Donaldson, and receiver Billy
Brooks plus a 1992 No. 1 pick.
Colts coach Ron Meyer could
employ an innovative four-
quarterback offense called the
“Run—and-Pray.”

., Ted Turner

By Brant Longest
For Tbe Pitt News

Over 50 Eastern Bloc and
Western countries will compete
in media mogul Ted Turner's
Good Will Games this summer,

This will mark the first time
these countries have competed
on American soil since the 1932
Olympics were held in Los
Angeles.

Twenty-one sports
encompassing 1832 medal
events will highlight this
international sporting event

which will take place from July
20 to Aug. 5 in Seattle, Wash-

In 1986, the inaugural (and
highly successful) Goodwill
Games were held in Moscow
and now move to America as
the games keep the same
quadrennial, site-shifting format
as the Olympics.

The purpose of the Games is
twofold. First, it allows about
2,500 athletes a chance to gain
world-class competition
experience, thus aiding their
ability to assess each other’s
strategies and weak points.

provides

Second, the Games keep the
sporting world a little less
anxious between Olympic
summers. (The Goodwill Games
and the Olympics alternate every
two years.)

Four years ago in Moscow, six
world records were broken,
including American heptathlete
Jackie Joyner—Kersee’s 7,148-
point performance and Soviet
pole-vaulter Sergi Bubka’s 19-
foot—3/4—inch vault. The vault
was also the sixth consecutive
time he eclipsed his own world
record.

A surprisingly poor showing
by the USA in the boxing
tournament in Moscow has led
to an increase in the amount of
intensity and focus by the
American boxers for the
upcoming games. In the 12
weight classes, the Soviets won
11 gold medals. The Americans
brought home one.

Ironically, ice hockey will be
played in the July heat of this
year's Games. Also, baseball is
now a medal sport, and although
the United States will have little
competition, they have a 105-

prelude to Summer Olympics

year head start on teams like the
Russian squad. There will also
be an exhibition of the little-
known sport “Moto-Ball," which
is a cross between soccer and
polo played on motorcycles.
Innovations for the Games will
include point—of-view cameras
strapped to the backs of referees,
on the handlebars of cyclists
and on the goals of the hockey
nets. In keeping with the name
of this multi-national sporting
event, there will be a link-up
with Soviet Cosmonauts during

Continued from page 7

Gizzi hopes to start pre-med at
Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia (whose nickname,
fittingly, is the Medics). He has
applied there, but has not received
an acceptance letter yet. Not to
worry, however; he ’s also applied
to “seven or eight” other medical
schools in the Philadelphia area,
and he is sure he’ll get into one of
them.

“My family is from Philly; my
girlfriend lives there. I really like
that area,” said Gizzi.

Gizzi graduated from Penn with
a degree in biology in 1988 and
was working at the Cardiothoracic
Research Lab at Penn's University
Hospital when he heard the
Gladiators were holding an open
tryout and decided to go for it.

“[Playing football] has been a
nice break away from school
work,” said Gizzi, although he
hasn't gone cold turkey from
studying. “Joe Miccia [another
Gladiator tryout] is also interested
in med school, and he brought a
couple of books, anatomy and
biology, to camp. We looked
over those.”

Gizzi was all-Ivy at Penn his
senior year and played on two
Ivy League championship teams
while centering the Quakers’
offensive line. He still snaps the
ball for the Glads, and in fact, he
played defense until

T ie Me Up!
Tie Me Down!

By Dmitri Ragano
Entertainment Editor

A case could be made for Pedro
Almodovar as the hot director of
the past decade. He burst out of
post—Franco Spain with crazy
erotic films inﬂuenced by the
cinematic greats (Bunuel, Fellini,
Hitchcock) as well as punk rock,
absurdist theater and soft—core
porn like Emmanuelle 1.

Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! is
Almodovar’s eighth ﬁlm. It’s a
continuation of the heterosexual
themes of last year's Women on
the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown. Although Tie Me Up!
Tie Me Down! earned an X rating
for its wind-up—toy masturbation
scene, this ﬁlm is pretty tame
stuff for Almodovar, whose
earlier, explicit gay films would
never have been popular in this
country.

As in all of Almodovar’s movies,
the plot of Tie Me Up! Tie Me
Downlis cheap, cheesy and wildly
incredulous (and I mean all of
this in the best sense). After 23-
year-old Ricky (Antonio
Banderas) is released from the
mental home’ he’s stayed in since
childhood, he decides he wants a
normal life —— work, life and
family.

Ricky's plan for getting a normal
life is violently abnormal. He has
his heart set on Marina (Victoria
Abril), a famous ex—junkie porno
star. Marina is currently working
on a horror ﬁlm with a legendary,

The Buddha of Suburbia
Hanif Kureishi

The Buddha taught that the
eight-fold path to enlightrnent
consisted of right faith, right
judgement, right language, right
purpose, right practice, right
obedience, right memory and
right meditation.

These right ways are set and
must be properly followed. By
following his own “right” path,
Haroon, the Buddha of Suburbia,
creates misery for many, balanced
by happiness for himself, his son
and his followers. Haroon is a
dreamy, philosophical
government clerk from India,
mired in the unhappiness of his
marriage, within which he is
nagged by his English wife and
her relatives to conform, achieve
and thereby create wealth.

Haroon chooses not to, falling
in love with one—breasted Eva, a
social butterﬂy caught in the net
of her own unhappy marriage
and fascinated by Haroon‘s Zen
attitude toward life. She begins to
invite friends over to hear him
speak and watch him meditate.
Overnight, Haroon achieves his
ambition to gently philosophize
a group of followers down the
path to Nirvana. As Har0Or1’S

more time at Eva's, his son Karim’s
life also begins to blossom.

condition doesn’t prevent horny

Ricky follows Marina home
from the movie studio and
kidnaps her, breaking her tooth
in the process. Ricky explains his
intentions to marry Marina and
conﬁdently, patiently waits for
her to fall in love with him. Ricky
is gentle and kind —~— except

The Buddha of Suburbia is a
story of families coming apart
and joining together, of cultures

evolving. It is hilariously narrated
by Karim, a stalwart optimist
who responds to his environment
with vast curiosity, adolescent
wit and energetic intelligence.
The story is of his
coming of age one
year, frantically full

well as hinwself, and when. he ties
her to the bed when he goes out.

The story of their bonding
progresses into an irreverent,
happy ending. Only the crankiest
of moviegoers will leave the
theater unpleased.

As always, Almodovar has
gathered an excellent, statuesque
cast. Banderas, who plays Ricky,

Karim is a dedicated people
lover, and on the breakup of his
parents’ marriage, he begins to
spend a great deal of time staying
with friends and relatives.

Hanif Kureishi demonstrated
his cultural recording skills as
screenwriter of My Beautiful
Launderette and Sammy and
Rosie Get Laid. In his first novel,
he proves his skill as a
consummate scriptwriter. In
Karim he has found the right
voice to tell this possibly
autobiographical story. Karim’s
emotions never stop him from a
chance to experience something
new, for Karim learned that life is
short and absurd, so it is to be
enjoyed fully whenever possible.
His youth and remaining
innocence always assert
themselves by showing the most
ridiculous side of every situation.

named Pyke, he does not hesitate
to use plenty of sex and raw talent
to climb into the position of highest
recognition.

Karim undergoes beatings,
name-calling, spitting and other
rank demonstrations of bigotry,
but pointedly ignores them.
Kureishi presents social and
economic issues realistically in
The Buddha, but he is not
obsessed by the need to show
Indians as underdogs and
Englishmen as abusive
imperialists. Karim’s story may
not be typical because he is able
to transcend his circumstances.
He never succumbs to self-pity or
accepts his inferiority.

This story is about a family
which rises above its miseries,
heals itself and allows its members
to become their best. Kureishi
may shock us, but he never bores
us and often enlightens us.

in Buddha Joy Luck

The Joy Luck Club
Amy Tan

Only in Oriental cultures
would two nouns, joy and luck,
be used together without a
conjunction. Joy could be a
description of luck, or luck could
be a description of joy. Or perhaps
the words are interchangeable —
equally emphatic or equally
meaningless. For whatever
reason, the words are tied, as are
the lives of the four women and
their daughters who form the
corner of the Mah-jong table, the
Joy Luck Luck Club. Their lives
form an intricate web of patterns,
beautifully told by Tan with
profundity, honesty and grace.
We are not treated to idle
chatter and bickering gossip, as
one might expect in a book which
is essentially about a ladies’
weekly card—club meeting.
Instead, Tan transports us vividly
into each woman's past. Each of
the mothers’ stories is told from
pre-revolutionary mainland
China, and the daughters’. stories
from post— World-War-II San
Francisco. But the stories are less
important for descriptions of
settings, or even of people for
that matter, than they are for
descriptions of the interplay
between mothers, sisters,
daughters, aunts, cousins and
girlfriends. This is a woman's

book, and the mother-daughter
relationship looms in it.
Unfortunately every one of
the relationships in this book is
neurotic. June can never be good
enough to fulfill her mother's
expectations of what it takes to
“make it” as an American.
Waverly is an undeniable genius, L
but she hates her mother’s
constant bragging and the way
she shows her off to complete
strangers. Both Lena and Rose
have their marriages destroyed
by their mothers, who criticize
them in tiny but devastating ways.
The mothers are so strong that
they are inevitably taken seriously
by their daughters, to _the-
detriment of their relationships.
Although the stories are ,
beautifully written, they i are
unquestionably flawed. Mis$,_-Tan
has not provided her characters
with individual personalities.
Mothers and daughters are
completely interchangeable. All
relate different stories, but they
speak with only one voice. These
women are individualized by no
unusual behavior patterns,
personalization of speech, or
even major differences in physical
appearances. The result is that
this “novel” reads more like a
series of loosely related short
stories. '
