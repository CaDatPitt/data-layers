‘Thanksgiving Party

7 Attracts Crowd Of 400

 

According to the sex of the remarker it was, with em-

phasis, “a ﬁne party” or “a

lovely party.” .And the re-"

markers ranged from. the classes of the pi eighties to the
cherubsof 1926. Four hundred alumni and guests came to

the ﬁrstl fall social event the

Alumni Association has ever

fostered. Wednesday evening made history,‘ for the crowd

and the very genial spirit that caused the “ﬁne party” re-
marks guaranteed that hereafter the evening before Thanks-
giving will be a regular alumni night.

The early part of the evening waso

spent in “chinning” or playing bridge
or ﬁve hundred. And many were the

card players, who were much occu-
pied nodding and speaking “hello” to
everybody else there. Lunch was

thereafter until nearly'1 o'clock those
who did not play cards joined‘ those
who- did to hear‘ a local vaudeville
program. Victor Canino, dental stu-
dent from Porto Rico, with the ever-
willing Gus Schnabel as his accom-
panist, , played his implement, his
musical saw. A toe-dancing num-
ber by little Rose Kirk followed. J.
C-. McBurney, another representative
of the dental school, a favorite with
University people, star cap and gown
performer, sang by request “Rose of
Picardy” and other numbers. He
also was accompanied by Gus. Then

arranged and composed by’ Helen
Hunt, and performed by two of her
high school ‘pupils, entitled “A Day
in the Cathedral of Learning.” Pos-
sibly by the time the Cathedral is
ﬁnished the 1 .“studes” will ever
Charleston rather than walk! Any-
way, it was refreshing to see how the
younger generation can marathon

ing as a college prof, lectured on
“Sew’s Your Old Man,” and amused
with remarks with a local ﬂavor!
Zareh Yardum, unaccompanied, gave
sev"eral_’ much appreciated violin
numbers. Then the two got into
harness together and Art and Zareh
with banjo and mandolin gave the

it took the three freshman boys to
show just how the barefoot dances
should ‘have been done and the “take-
off.” was much enjoyed by the crowd.
Chalkyp Williamson, retiring coach,‘
spoke on the football situation. The
program was interrupted, at onetime
for a little practice on football yells.
The committee had distributed song
sheets" with University songs and had
planned to close the affair with danc-
ing, but it would have taken more
than one evening to have done all the
committee planned. .

‘A grad from a class in the 80's
said that without a doubt it was the
nicest University party he‘ had ever
attended. We ﬁeel he was qualiﬁed
to judge. And the credit in very
great part goes to Helen Hunt, who
as chairman Worked and worked'"and
worked. ‘Reservations were slow in
being‘ returned, but, undaunted, the
committee prepared for a crowd.‘
Andit is a compliment to the crowd’.

ada and came over to merry
England to put over the ﬁnish‘-
ing touches. At ﬁrst I worked
with the Metropolitan-Vickers
Electric Co. in Manchester, to
gain a- ﬁrst. hand insight‘ into
English industrial methods and
practices. I am now in Cam-
bridge’ University supplementing
the practical with the theoreti-
cal, plus some work in English
literature as a_ side line.

“The system, over here is ut-
terly diiferent from our Ameri-‘
can methods. The men enter the
University at,a somewhat older
age and stay from then to ﬁve
years. It is possible to get the
B.A. degree in three" years,
which corresponds with the
American A.B. and B.S.

“The University dominates the
town and owns most of the land
‘within it. However, the Uni‘ve'r-
sity proper is but one. phase of
the life. There are 17' colleges
in which the students are regis-
tered, and they supply most of
the professors and all the stu-
‘dents.

George Kirk Here

George M. Kirk, Col. ’13, who will
always be famous to Pitt men. on ac-
count of writing the words for “Hail
to Pitt,” washere for the Thanks-
giving season, and he had a chance
to “reune” with Pittites by attend-
ing the party at the University Club
Thanksgiving eve, and the Penn State
football game '.at the Stadium on
Thanksgiving day. Kirk is with the
Colorado Fuel and Iron Co., Trinidad,
Colo;, his address being 503 First
National Bank‘ Building. He advises
that several Pittites are with his
companyinthe Colorado city, among
them being E. C. Ferree, '10, a class-
mate of the Alumni Secretary, and
Donald Sibray, Eng. '26, who has re-
cently joined their Engineering De-
partment. ’

Kirk was enroute from New York,

to Colorado_,_.dropping_ off here for
. the game. The, State ..game_ was the

The record stands ﬁve ~vic_._.- 

tories, two ties.and_two' defeats, two of the victories being .
over time honored r1vals,_Penn State and West‘ Virginia‘; also
a tie in that big game «with W. &_ J. and _a tie with 'George- _§;

result of its tie score games» with Brown’ and Syracuse. The ‘
defeats at the hands of Lafayetteand Tech were ‘more or_ less" r
expected. Carnegie Tech has one of the -strongest’ teams in.‘
the country this year, and it was not surprising that they ‘de-
feated the great N otre Dame outﬁt last Saturday. Congratu-

cent heavier than last- year, the ﬁg-

people saw the nine games in the
.Pitt Stadium. This ﬁgure is as large
as _any attendance ﬁgure in the-
United_ States, with two exceptions,
according. .to»ﬁgures which have just
been printed by the Associated
Press. The home games of the Uni-
Verslty of Chicago “drew 235,000",
I1_11_n0is 1 225,000, _Michigan 195,000,
Ohio .18.3,000, Northestern 179,000
and so on. The largest .cr.o‘wd tovat-
tend a game in the Western Con-

‘ference was the Ohio State-Michi‘-
» gan game, which. drew 94,000. The

largest crowd of the season was the
Army-Navy game, the bﬁgure‘ being
estimated at 110,000. ;The largest
crowd ata Pitt game was at;tl_i_e

Penn -State game, the approximate

attendance being 50,000. These ﬁg-

ures are gaining each year, and it

is only a matterof a year or so‘ be-'
fore" theistadium will be packed for

spelled in blue, with a white back-
ground‘. “As the buglers ‘sounded
taps, one being, located" in each end
of the Stadium, the silence in the
Stadium was ‘very impressive, the
only sound being the ticking of the
telegraph insti'um'ents'. A large"
body of Yalealumni attended the
game, and many expressions of ap-
proval have‘ been received over the
way the program was carried out".
Pitt was very glad, indeed, to honor
the memory of Walter Camp, one
of the finest characters in the his-
tory of intercollegiate football, and

the University of Pittsburgh in se-
lecting his All-American teams‘.

The 1927. Schedule T

The alumni are naturally‘ greatly
interested in next year’s. football

nounced. ‘It includes games in order
with Thiel, Grove City, West Vir-
ginia, ‘Drake, Carnegie ."Te.ch,» Alle-

Mid-Western alumni a chan'ce—to-"see
the Panthers in action. A number
01' alumni have already signiﬁed
their intention of. taking this trip.
The schedule is ‘planned to bring .a

before the l... & J. game. The re-
turn of Nebraskato the ‘schedule is
appealing to the “grads.” Ne-
braska’s great game here some years
ago-is still talked about. They are
'one[,of the outstanding teams of the
coiuiitry and one of ‘the most colorful
scl ools. They will attract a big
throng to the Stadium. -

The Athletic. authorities made a

Ohio State. For the information of
‘the alumni it can be;,stated that this
game would have been played in
Pittsburgh had it not been for

development gave ;Ohio State a
chance. to play Princeton, a game
which would have given them much

Thousands Of lAlumlni  
Saw. Pitt Football Ga

The. football season which was wound up with '_the- ;'i-‘
Thanksgiving Day ganie with Penn State was truly a remark- ‘C
.able one. The victory over Penn. State proved a_. ﬁttingﬁnale '3
for it, and while everygame‘ was not won, it is thegeneral .-
impression of the alumni that ‘there should be few: regrets” :‘

the yearly’ rate of $2.005, .‘

that the game beiplayed at 3......

but the way the. Pitt schedule. shaped
up such a move was impossible. Pitt
feels very cordial towards. Lafayette,
and it is hoped‘ that football rela-
tions, will be resumed in a year or so.

A Cathedral Sideligbts

The Frick Acres, Railroad is gone.

With it go all the thrills and fun
.that—it has provided for thehundreds
of Schenley I-Iigh=“kids”' and Pitt

Interest in the railroad reached
its peak late in October, when Herb
Dent, then‘ chairman. of the sopho-
more hazing. committee, planned to
sell stock to freshmen for the “Frick
Acres Rapid Transit Company.”
But, in spite of all the. “smott
creeks” cast in its direction. the lit-
tle rairoad was largely 1'e‘spo’nsible
for the rapid completion’ of excava-
tion work -on the Cathedral plot.
Instead of taking sixty working_ days
to complete excavation", as the con-
tract for that work stated, the
dinkey engines hauled.50.000 _cubic
yards of dirt in less than ﬁfty work-
1ng‘days.- It * *_ ‘

_ the diamond edged drill have been
. most favorable. . Contractors expect

.no~“pockets” or weak spots in_ the
rock the Cathedral will. be
upon, but these tests‘ are absolute

" proof of the co[_ditioII.. of ‘the bed-
. rock. The cores are about two and

a half inches in , 'iarnet‘ejr, roundand
smooth on the e ges. They come up
in various lengths, and thus far they

are solid rock. , .

PITT INFERIORITY COMPLEX‘.
S‘ : ‘ ,
“Many discussions have been
raised during the past few years
concerning the inferiority complex,-

its reactions on diiferent people and r

its shortcomings. Pitt, at.t' _pre_~s-c
entstage of its-development, is suf-
fering from a bad case of inferior-
ity complex. Pitt students. 4 are
afraid to do anything different;
they are afraid to use their own
initiative in matters concerning
student life. and their curriculum.
The University of Pittsburgh. is a
large school--one of the largestin
the East. Its faculty is on a par

with the best in the country. With _
the erection of the Cathedral, 9. new .

type of‘ college ‘building will be

thrown open to the world. Why in —

the “world Pitt students. still‘ per-
sist in, the belief that their school
it not among the‘ ranking institu-
tions of the country -is a, mystery.
It_is' about; time that the student
body woke‘ up‘to thefactthat their
‘school’ is second to none!‘

From now on let’s— do what we
think best’ and not be‘ persuaded on
account. of some other school’s-.. e—‘
cision. If we want our freshmen‘
to. wear dinks‘. why worry‘ about
what other schools‘. do? Let’s. set
our own code of student government.
and conduct‘ ;.nd let's abide by its,
rules‘- Above ‘all,’ let"s discard. our]
inferiority‘ complex‘ ‘and,’ instead,
boast of ‘th-: fact that wears mem-

bers of so democratic» a» school as

Physical Ed Department
Plans Non-Greek Leagues

 

 

 

Plans for more active participa-

tion ot' all students in athletics are
being made by Russel Miller, in-
structor of physical education.’ Mil-
ler is planning to organize a bas-
ketball league composed of all clubs
' in the university that do not belong
to the Greek letter fraternity league
and of fraternities that do no main-
tain a house. Representatives from
any school organization desirous of
joining such a league should see Mil-
ler at his office, he says.
. All students who have played soc-
ce_1‘- football in high school or who
are interested in forming tea_ms and
playing intra-school soccer should
,see,M_iller Friday afternoon at one
_o'clock in Trees gym. In comment-
ing on these two proposed leagues,
Miller pointed out that too many
is-tudents are not given the oppor-
tunity to participate in competitive
athletics unless they go out for -the
varsity teams. These «leagues are
intended to give those who do not
make the varsity teams a chance to
play basketball and other sports, he
stated.

viewed the crowd at the stadium

“Naw. That W-J crowd was big-

been directing the crowds at the sta-
dium ever since it was built.

“The kids act purty decent. We
don’t have much trouble,” continued
the first officer.

“Aw, that West Virginia bunch are
='*~ sorta gay. But most of the fellows
are awright. The girls never give
us any trouble,” the other police-
man remarked.

“Hey. there! You can’t get in
here. Get out!” and the two oflicers
went over to the entrance.‘

 ‘With a great, surge of_"col'o'r,"“a;hund1‘ed‘of the country's finest
collegiate distance’ runners ‘left startéirsmark in Van Cortland
 , Park, New York, last week. During the ﬁrst mile around the polo
ﬁeld, Blue and Bold jerseys of Pitt were mingled withthe Orange of.
Syracuse, Crimson of Harvard, and the Blue and White of Yale and
_ Penn State. But atthe three mile mark, Panther. rooters were sure
* that their teamwas not to be a contender for the cross-country crown
with Syracuse and ‘State again, for not ai-Panther man lead the ﬁrst
ﬁve, of Syracuse or ‘Penn State. Penn State was obviously in the,
advantage, with Cox winging it ﬁfty yards ahead of the long line of
runners. Loucks, who broke‘ the Panther course record in a dual meet
here, was running third back of Macauley Smith of Yale. He main-
tained this position till the end of the race.»
, , Bob Marquis, the Blue .and'Bold’s best,._ﬁn_ished far in the ruck,
taking forty-second place. Compare this with last year when the
Pitt runners placed two among the first ‘ten and Marquis was twenty-
ﬁrst. Following Marquis.on the Panther team came Adams in ﬁfty-
ninth place, Gorski 'in.seve'ntieth -place, Hoffman in eighty-eighth, Lar-
son in ninetieth, Grossett in '100th, and Davis in 103r~d positions. The
team score was 346.. Penn State won the chase with sixty-ﬁve points
and Syracuse‘ was second with sixty-eight. ~ »
