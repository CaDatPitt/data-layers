UNIVERSITY DELEGATION
TO ATTEND CONCLAVE

Group Will Take Part In Local
Political Convention Sunday

The University delegation to the
Intercollegiate Conference on Govern-
ment departs from its regular schedule
next Sunday to participate in a city-
wide political convention. The con-
vention is to be a small scale model
of the state-wide convention to be held
in Harrisburg, April 24 to 26.

The local convention will be pre-
sided over by Miss Genevieve Blatt,
graduate assistant in political science,
and will be held at Mount Mercy Col-
lege. The following schools will par-
ticipate: Duquesne, Carnegie Institute
of TechnologY» Pennsylvania College
for VI/omen, Mount Mercy College, and
the University.

Any student or faculty member in-
terested in participating in the city-
wide convention, whether or not they
are interested in the Harrisburg con-
clave, are invited to attend. There will
be no fee or special assessment.

Present plans for the Sunday meet-
ing call for a discussion of pertinent

political issues, and especially those -
to be considered at the state-wide con- 1

vention next month.

AN OPEN LETTER -

Concerning The Military Ball

Editor, The Pitt News:

As chairman of the Military Ball
Committee, I feel that out of a sense
of fairness to the student body and to
the committee a few facts concerning
the postponement and consequent set-
ting of a new date and place for the
ball should be made public.

Thursday morning, March 19, when
it became evident that carrying through
the Ball planned on March 20 would
be impossible, every effort was made
to notify interested persons of the post-
ponement. In going through the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel's engagement book
that morning, we found that——other
than April 27—the only date on which
it would be possible to have the ball
at the hotel was the Wednesday during
Holy Week, which for obvious reasons
would have been unsatisfactory.

The committee immediately con-
tacted the management of Motor
Square Garden, the only ﬂoor in the
city considered large enough to hold
the expected crowd. This met with
little or no success, and so the only
apparent solution, however unsatisfac-
tory, was to hold the ball at the Hotel
William Penn on April 27. In spite of
the fact that this was the Monday of
Spring Festival Week, we felt that to
avoid a loss to the University of the
large amount of money already in-
vested, it was best to go ahead and
plan for the date of April 27.

However, the committee ran into un
expected difficulties in the form of
rather heated objections on the part of
the Executive Committee of the Stu-
dent Faculty Association to having the
ball on that date.

Rather than cause more unfavorable
comment, the committee with Dean
Lanfear went to Carnegie Institute of
Technology to investigate the possibil-
ity of using the Tech gym and Thistle
Hall. Dean Tarbell was very gracious

in his acceptance of our proposal, and
we returned with permission to use
both Thistle Hall and the gymnasium
for dancing, and the girls’ gym as a
lounge and smoking room for the date
of Wednesday, April 22.

This, we feel, is a gesture of the type
of good fellowship which is and always
should be in existence between Pitt and
our neighbor, Carnegie Tech.

A few facts concerning the desir-
ability of holding the dance at Tech
are pertinent. Contrary to belief, the
gym, which can and will be very nicely
decorated for the occasion, has in
itself over 2000 more square feet of
floor space than the entire 17th floor of
the William Penn, while Thistle Hall
approximates in size the Hotel Schen-
ley ballroom. As the setup calls for
only two bands, the committee is at-
tempting to contract the same two na-
tional bands, Harold Stern's and Hot-
cha Gardner's. If it is impossible to
make such contracts, we guarantee that
we will have two bands every bit as
good as these.

The Military Ball committee and the
department want it understood that
since we were unable to put on the ball
as and when scheduled, those who have
bought tickets are at perfect liberty to
return them to the Military Department
Office, Room 1101, Cathedral, at any
time after 2:30 o'clock on Friday, April
3.

The purpose of this letter is not to
sell the ball, but merely to point out
the facts to those whom we feel are
unjustly criticising the Military Ball
committee, and that the arrangements
made, while not exactly as we would
wish, are the best possible under the
circumstances.

HOWARD E. LUTZ,

Chairman of the Military Ball
Committee

“We've got a new ﬁnd for the
campus this time,” says Paul Keiser,
C36, Shamokin home-town boy who
made good as president of the College
Assocation and is now getting ready
for his fourth and last dance chairman-
ship of the year.

The new ﬁnd is Len Mahlzern and
his Society Club Orchestra, who have
as yet never been heard at campus af-
fairs.

The band (it's the best in the coun-
try, of course) has played at the Half
Moon Inn in Steubenville, Ohio, and at
the Pittsburgh Country Club.

The dance will be held Friday night
from 9 to 1 o'clock at the Grotto. As
for dress, Keiser insists, “We don't
even care if you show up in sweaters.”

Tickets, at $1 a couple, may be pur-
chased from Keiser, Edwin Beachler,
Doris Evans, Ted Whitaker, Beverley
Brown, William Hughes, Lucy Conn,

NEWS ENDS CAMPAIGN
TODAY FOR UNIVERSITY
FLOOD RELIEF MONEY

MT.

Paper's Sales Reach 2200 Mark
Monday To Aid Red Cross;

Special Donations Given

VVith a mark of 2200 sales in Mon-
day's campaign to beat, The Pitt News
ﬁnishes today its drive for funds to
represent the University's contribution
to the Red Cross ﬂood relief fund.

Issues of The News today are being
sold for ﬁve cents a copy at the regular
distribution stands in all Schools, in ad-
dition to a central stand in Room 801,
Cathedral, where papers may be pur-
chased up until 5 o'clock today.

A couple of surprise packages came
to The News office Monday to augment
the total receipts gained from sales of
the 2200 copies. These were in the form
of two checks, one of $20 from Arthur
Pound, research professor of history,
and the other of $5 from Mildred E.
Stegeman, secretary of the chancellor.

Mr. Pound, this year engaged in a
writing project at the Historical So-
ciety Building, was in New York at the
time of the ﬂood and wrote an article
for the New York Sun. The check he
received he has divided, sending part
of it to Dr. Bowman to be given to the
Pittsburgh Red Cross, and part of it to
the Red Cross at Johnstown.

Dr. Bowman endorsed the check to
the Red Cross and submitted it to the
News to be included with the Univer-
sity's contribution.

Others Are Generous

Many others have been generous in
contributions by refusing change for
bills and coins when purchasing copies
of the paper Monday. The News ap-
preciates these donations, but is equally
grateful to all those whose nickels
showed a ﬁne spirit of generosity
throughout the University. The nomi-
nal charge of five cents was established
in order to permit everyone to have
a part in making up the University's
donation in this worthy cause.

Friday's issue of The News will be
distributed free of charge, as usual, and
will carry the results of the two-day
sale and report the sum of money
which will make up the University's
contribution.

The bigger-that sum is, the happier
The News will be—and the more proud
Pitt's campus should be.

SFA Executive Committee
To Finish Nomination Today

They had a long session Sunday af-
ternoon, but the executive committee
of SFA will be working till late into
tonight to complete the list of nomi-
nations in time for announcement in
Friday's Pitt News.

Since the ten present junior assem-
blymen and four of the ﬁve junior wo-
men in SFA have signiﬁed their in-
tention of running for re-election, only
ten of the twenty junior men petition-
ing will be nominated. Of the junior
women, only 6 will be nominated.

Twenty sophomore men and ten
sophomore women must be weeded out
of the 60 petitioning for nomination.

Petitions for Men's Council are due
by 5:00 o'clock today in the office of
the dean of men. .

The elections for both SFA assem-
blymen and members of Men's Coun-
cil will be held on April 17.

Giant Spoon, Tap Da.yHonor~,__
Once Had ‘Chastisirtgi’-Efcct

It won't be long now

one month, to be exact

till Spring Fes-

tival, with its Tap Day, its carnival, its sweepstakes, its Varsity Night,
its Sub-Freshman Day, and its big informal dance hits the University

campus again.

Upperclassmen know what to look forward to during the week of
May 1, but to the freshman, Spring Festival Week is still an unknown
quantity; that is, unless they happened to be in on the Interscholastics

program tried out for the ﬁrst time
last year.

But this isn't supposed to be a story
on Spring Festival; it is supposed to
relate a tradition much older than the
Cathedral, the Stadium, yes, even older
than Heinz House. In fact the tradi-
tion of the Senior Spoon harks way
back to the days of the Civil War.

Not that it has anything to do with
the War of the Secession (1861-1865) as

such, but from all reports, it had its

origin in a somewhat similar fracas.

It was during the administration of
Dr. George Woods, as Chancellor of
the University, that the spoon was
ﬁrst presented. It seems that the sen-
iors had been acting up until the prob-
lem of disciplining them had become
acute, to say the least. According to
old records, Dr. Woods called the sen-
iors into his office and delivered a
“very pungent lecture on behaviour,"
after which he presented the spoon to
them, “thinking to shame them by lik-
ening them to children who needed
parental oversight."

Nothing in the old documents said
anything about the effectiveness of this
lesson, but the seniors seized upon the
spoon as an opportunity to make an
impression upon the next class.

From then on the Spoon was pub-
licly presented each year, with some
interruptions, by the president of the
senior class to the president of the
junior class. This custom ceased in

1923, and was revived but once, when

the president of the Class of 1927 pre-
sented it to the president of the Class
of 1923.

On each of‘ these occasions a silver
plate, engraved with the year numerals

of the senior and junior classes, was

fastened to the Spoon. At present
there are 32 plates, the ﬁrst one read-
ing: “From the Class of 1871 to the
Class of 1872.”

According to reports of old gradu-
ates, there were often active struggles
for the Spoon, immediately after its
presentation, and often the Spoon
would be spirited away and hidden
until the next ceremony. Lapses of
from one to six years between presen-
tations seems to indicate that often
it was hidden in "uncharted fields."

The general condition of the spoon
when it was found in 1924. was evi-
dence of the fact that in the clashes of
the classes, no thought was signiﬁcant
save that of obtaining the prize.

The Spoon was made from a wal-
nut tree that grew on the campus of
the University when the institution was
located at Third Avenue and Cherry
Alley, Pittsburgh.

Since its reclamation in 1924, it has
been repaired to some extent, and is
now in the possession of the Univer-
sity registrar. Each year it is presented
to the most representative man and
woman in the junior class as a tradi-
tional part of the Tap Day celebra-
tion. The seniors who have previously
received the Spoon do the presenting.

FREEDOM OF RELIGION
TO BE FORUM SUBJECT

Father Ross, Writer, Educator,
Lecturer Will Be Speaker

The subject at the regular session of
Inquiry Forum today will be “Re-
ligious Liberty,” according to an an-
nouncement made by Katherine Mon-
ori, C36, co-chairman of the Forum.

Rev. J. Elliot Ross, noted Catholic
lecturer, educator, and writer, will be
the speaker. A graduate of L0_Y0I3
College, George Washington Univer-
sity, and Catholic University, Father
Ross has been a chaplain to Catholic
students in a number of western
schools, pastor of churches, and a mem-
ber of the faculty of universities, not-
ably Teacher's College, Columbia.

Father Ross is a student of social
problems, and is keenly interested in
the subject of a living wage for work-
ers. He has written several books on
this question, the best known of which
is “Consumers and Wage Earners.”
He is also interested in the relation of
ethics to social problems of the day,
and this interest is attested in two of
his books “The Right To Work,” and
“Sanctity and Social Service.”

In line with the policy of the last
meetin of Inquiry, the discussion per-
iod wil be held during the whole of
the sixth hour, the ﬁfth hour being
used by the speaker. The meeting will
be held in Room 107, Alumni Hall, as
usual. All students are invited.

Classical Group
Takes Vacation;
Tours Museum

Members of the Classical Club of
the University went on a “Spring
Cruise” through the Greek and Roman
sections of Carnegie Museum last
Tuesday.

The tour was under the guidance of
bliss Mary Agnes Rubino, a senior in
the School of Education and a senior
docent of Carnegie Museum.

A regular feature of University life

-in Europe is an annual spring cruise

to classical lands. Students in the Uni-
versity here so seldom ﬁnd it practi-
cable to undertake such a cruise in
the brief spring vacation here, that the
Classical Club has initiated its own.

Members of the club on the “cruise”
inspected Etruscan urns and read from
manuscripts 1,000 years old. all in one
afternoon and with none of the wor-
ries or expense of travel in foreign
lands, according to Miss Rubiuda de-
scription. ‘

The club hopes to make the "Spring
Cruise" an annual event.

Awai-dNomineesSeIeded

EBERT OFFERS AGAIN
TO MEET COMMITTEE

Reporter's Story Gets Interest,
Omits Time And Place

Maybe it was the atmosphere down
there in Wilmerding that was respon-
sible. Perhaps it was the reporter's
ﬁrst story.

Anyhow, Rule No. 1 of the funda-
mentals of reporting was forgotten by
the Senior Ball reporter who passed
up the “whcn" and “where" features
in announcing the ﬁrst committee meet-
ing for the ﬁnal major dance of the
year.

“And to think,” Charles Ebert, C,
chairman of the ball, later conﬁded, “I
even hurried up to Alumni Hall to pay
a nickel for a copy of The News."

Flash: That Senior Ball meeting
will be held immediately following the
taking of the committee picture for
the Owl, Friday. The picture is sched-
uled for 2:10 o'clock, Room 1001, Cath-
edral. Ebert has re-scheduled that ﬁrst
committee meeting open to any mem-
ber of the graduating class for 2:20
o'clock, Room 821, Cathedral.

Oh yes, seven Seniors did come to a
meeting that had no room to meet in,
and was held at no particular time,
proving that you can never tell what
may happen.

Tippetts To Speak Saturday
At Convention Of Teachers

Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean of the
School of Business Administration, is

man, president of the Bow‘ Green
State Teachers College of owling
Green, Kentucky, who will speak on
“Commercial Education, Past, Present,
and Future,” Dr. Tippetts will address
the commercial education leaders on,
"Is Inﬂation Corning?”

The second of the semi-annual meet-
ings held by the association of com-
mercial education teachers of Penn-
sylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, will
feature the election of officers and the
exhibition of the latest in commercial
education textbooks and office machin-
ery.

Following Dr. Tippetts' address,
which is scheduled for 10 o'clock Sat-
urday morning, the annual spring
luncheon will be held at Hotel Web-

Gilding The Golden Rule
EVERAL DAYS AGO, when we spoke of
 testing Pitt’s heart, we had a tiny suspicion
that there might be a few leaking valves. True
as the adage “it takes all kinds of people to make
a world,” there werea couple of leaking valves.
These were the folks who stood ﬁrm upon their
“rights” and bothered the administration with tele-
phone calls insisting that they could not be denied
an issue of Monday’s paper because they would not

 

contribute ﬁve cents to aid the ﬂood sufferers. Sub-

Theta A1pl1a'Phi, national honorary, '

The call for funds for ﬁnancing edu-
cation furnishes but one of the many
demands upon the public treasurics,
even though that demand is a neces-
sary one, says Dr. Marion K. McKay,
professor of economics. He outlined
the course “which we in Pennsylvania
must travel” to arrive ata. more satis-
factory system of taxation before the

Schoolman’s Conference in Philadel-
phia, Friday.
“Fiscal authorities are faced with

the grim task of raising and disbursing
funds for all governmental functions,”
declared Dr. McKay. “Any improve-
ment in our ﬁscal system will result in
alleviating the diﬁiculties incident to
the task of providing free and uni-
versal education. Educational leaders
must, therefore, be not only vitally in-
terested in school ﬁnance in particular,
but they must be keenly interested in
public ﬁnance in general.”

Describing this as a goal, Dr. Mc-
Kay pointed out to his audience some
of "the landmarks along the way.”

These include: a full recognition that
in a democracy education has a prior
claim upon the public purse; a clear
realization that education is not the
responsibility of the local districts
alone, but must be regarded as a func-
tion oi the state, hence state subsidies
are both desirable and justiﬁable.

A tax system that wou1d_be ﬂexible
enough to provide the necessary funds
and to reach all the citizens; more
skilled assessors, and more economical
methods of collecting taxes made man-
datory.

Elimination of many small govern-

mental units and small school districts
as well; broadening of the tax base
so as to lighten the burden on real
estate; assumption by the state of a
larger share of the expenses of educa-
tion; reﬁncmcnt of the method used in
allocating state subsidies.

Insistencc upon uniformity of effort
on the part of local communities as a
necessary prerequisite for state aid;
greater centralization of control over
local indebtedness, including the mar-
keting of bonds; more comprehensive
systems of budgeting, accounting, and
auditing.

Frequent and simpliﬁed reports to
the taxpayers; blocking of movements
aiming at the imposition of tax rate
limitations: checking of the tendency
to earmark revenues, facilitating tax
payment on the installment plan.

Greater care in the selection of pub-
lic officials including school boards and
educational leaders; uniform applica-
tion of the law among all taxpayers;
paving the way for graduated income
and inheritance taxes; checking the
tendency to add to the lists of tax
exempt property. Cultivating a deeper
sense of the responsibilities that go
with citizenship in a democracy.

He added: citizens should familiar-
ize themselves with all the ﬁnancial
needs of government, and should have
a comprehensive view of our entire tax
system.

Introduce such changes or amend-
ments in our constitution as will make
possible the reorganization of our gov-
ernment structure and the-utilization
of all sound ﬁscal practices, he con-
cluded.

13,000 Homes 
By Flood Watei's,
‘ Red Cross Shows

Local Business Index Declines
Sharply As Disaster Halts
City’s Pulse For Days

According to a preliminary survey
by the Research and Statistics Unit of
the Pittsburgh Red Cross, based on the
data collected by the Real Property
Inventory ‘Division of the Bureau of
Business Research, 18,000 residential
structures housing 28,000 inhabitants
were in the ﬂood area of Allegheny
County. ~

Not all these families were forced
to vacate their; houses, and damage is
said to vary from trifling amounts to
complete losses. 1

These homes represent eight percent
of the residential structures in the
county. For the most part they are
in the low rent, poor-conditioned sec-
tions. To bear this out the data show
that i11 1934 more than 50 per cent of
these structures were found to be in
bad order. Similarly, average rents in
these districts were under_$20 monthly,
in some areas as low as $14.

The report states that these state-
ments are not made to minimize the
extent of the. tragedy to, those in the
ﬂood zone but merely to, point out the
objective fact that the affected residen-
tial _structures do not constitute a rep-
resentative cross section. A compre-
hensive analysis of these and similar
data for the flood area is now being
made from the Bureau’s Real Prop-
erty Inventory data. The reportwill
be released shortly. ‘ "

ERIE ACADEMY TAKES
TEAM TITLE IN THIRD
SCHOOL TRACK MEET

East Palestine, Canonsburg Tie
For Second Place; Switzer
Wins Scoring Honors

Maybe it's the lake breeze up Erie-
way. At any rate, the school boys from
the lake coast city had just a little bit
too much steam for the district track-
nien as Erie Academy copped the team
title with a total of 21 and 1/10 points

in Pitt’s third annual indoor inter-
scholastics Saturday at the Track
House.

Roy Switzer of East Palestine, Ohio,
completely dominated the individual
show with a meet record in the high
hurdles, mixed in with two ﬁrsts, one
second and a tie for another ﬁrst.

Canonsburg was the only local out-
ﬁt to give the Academy runners a run
for their money, but had to be content
with a tie for runner-up honors with
Switzer, the one-man track team from
East Palestine. Academy High in its
two years of participation in the Uni-
versity-sponsored championships has
walked off with as many team titles,
winning in the ﬁrst annual event in
1934, and failing to enter in last year’s
competition.

Pete Noon Gets ‘Kick’ When Urban
‘Comes Through’ Against West Point

-’-_\.1_\‘- roommate had come through,”
Pete Noon, varsity cage center, con-
cluded in telling how Johnny Urban
finally broke into the Panther lineup
last fall to heave the longest completed
forward pass of the Pitt season against
the Army cadets. Although Noon has
spent plenty of time on the basketball
court against some of the ﬁnest players
in the game, the manner in which Ur-
ban “came through” gave him his big-
gest sports “kick.”

Early evening “bull sessions” in the
Noon-Urban room at the Phi Kap
house over on Craig street revealed
several events that would take place
providing they occurred in the proper
setting.

Urban, who Pete always regarded
as a passer of great ability, was quite
sure that he could take care of the
“passing” situation once he was iii-
jected in the lineup.

Pete's belief in Johnny remained
all through September and October.
Then, with ﬁve minutes of play re-
maining in the Army game, Dr. Sutli—
erland sent Urban into the game to
relieve one of the halfbacks. On the
first play, Urban blocked for Johnny
VVood on a reverse. Then on the sec-
ond play, Urban took the ball from
Stapulis on a fake reverse, faded back
to the right and shot a long pass far
down the ﬁeld in the direction of a
Pitt end.

Bomber Shaw was on the otherend
of that 45-yard heave and continued
the reniaining few yards to cross the
goal for the fourth Panther touchdown
of the afternoon.

INTERSCHOLASITC, PITT
SWIM CHAMPIONSHIPS
S-CHEIIULED SATURDAY

Sufficient Water Supply Assured;
Erie Tech, 1935 Champions,
Enter Powerful Team

\Vithvwater conditions in the city
back on a normal basis, the University
interscholastic swimming meet, post-
poned from last Saturday, will go on
review Saturday at 1:30 o’clock in
Trees pool. Along with the high school
meet will come the Pitt championships
for varsity and freshman natators.

Already 11 high school teams have
entered the meet, and more are ex-
pected before Saturday. The defending
champs, Erie Tech, will send another
strong water outﬁt down to Pittsburgh,
as will Canton McKinley of Ohio, and
Eric Strong-Vincent.

Teams that participated in the state
championship meet last week are ex-
pected to be among the competing
aggregations. If Fifth Avenue sends in
a team, this district will be assured of
a strong contender.

The ﬁght for Pitt titles will probably
be one of the features of the meet since
four winners last year will return to de-
fend their titles. Captain Lindberg,
Tom Locke, Tom Anderson, and Red
McQuillan are the boys.

Trial heats for scholastic entries will
be held during the afternoon, and in
the evening, the ﬁnals for both high
school and college tankmen will take
place.

Thus far teams from Eric Tech, Can-
ton McKinley, Erie Strong Vincent,
Cleveland Heights, Duquesne, Clairton,
Taylor Allderdice, Homestead, Central
Catholic, South Hills, and Turtle
Creek have been entered.

W. Don Harrison, director of ath-
letics, will act as honorary referee, with
Henry J._ Blum holding down the
referee’s post. John T. Taylor, starter;
P. J. Corr, director of meet; and sev-
eral prominent Pittsburgh sportsmen
will serve in other official posts.

The order of events for the after-

.noon follows: 40-yard freestyle schol-

astic trials; 100-yard breast stroke-
scholastic trials; 220—yard free-style
scholastic trials_; 100-yard backstroke-
scholastic trials, 100-yard free-style-
scholastic trials; 40-yard free-style-semi
ﬁnals; fancy diving for scholastic and
Pitt entries (six qualify); and 180-yard
medley relay for scholastic teams.

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, professor
of biology, will speak on “Primitive
Medicine” at a meeting of the Pre-
Medical Club at 12:30 o’clock today
in the office of the Dean of Men.

iNovice Wrestling‘
 Tourney Delayed;
Entry List Grows

Marooned for over a week. Eddie
Mazeski, Pitt wrestling lieadiiian, ﬁn-
ally reached dry land and the Stadium
dressing room which quarters his niat-
iiien, Monday. The ﬁrst official act
after his return was the issuance of
two important statements.

Both were of equal importance and
both concerned the state of Pitt’s
wrestling situation. To his varsity and
freshmen grapplers, Eddie sent out an
order demanding their attendance at a
special mat conclave scheduled for 4:30
today in the Stadium dressing room.

Then Eddie announced that the Iii-
tramural Vl/restling Tournament, slated
to begin today, had been shoved for-
ward still another week. This means
that the novice grunting tourney, still
suffering from the after effects of the
St. Patrick’s Day ﬂood, will not open
until ‘Wednesday, April 8.

"Supplementing this information, Ma-
zeski-revealed that the extra time will
give him another chance to workout
with the entries and should also swell
the entry ranks.

The simple mechanical details of cigarette manufacture are of
surprising importance. Upon them depend the physical prop-
erties of the cigarette, such as weight, size, ﬁrmness, moisture-
holding properties, uniformity of ﬁll, uniformity of product——
all of which have a far-reaching effect on the character of its

Attention!

On a tip from Lee M. Lockhart,
director of the University band and
orchestra, that an excellent piano
could be purchased for $100 spot
cash, if it was produced immediately,
WSGA, WAA, and YWCA Friday
pooled the money which they had set
aside for the purpose of buying a
piano for Heinz House and bought
the instrument.

The three organizations had been
planning to buy a new piano for Heinz
House for some time and had been
collecting money for it from the sale
of candy and sandwiches. The new
piano is in Heinz House waiting to be
tuned. The old piano will be kept for
the use of indiscriminate or amateur
players.

University Law
School Students
Enjoy Luxuries

Using Russian ash trays of hammer-
ed brass, and Polish trays in the form
of hand carved wooden shoes, discuss-
ing legal matters around a Chinese
seminar table, holding a mock trial
around a Russian table of hand carved
oak, or maybe lounging in tapestry
covered chairs between classes; these
were some of the luxuries which 50 of
the University's Law School students
have enjoyed for the past two days.

A. M. Thompson, dean of the School
of Law, moved the school to its tem-
porary quarters on the 13th ﬂoor of
the Cathedral while the Chamber of
Commerce building was being repaired
from the ﬂood damages.

“VVhat a cool place to study in,” re-
marked one student, while another mar-
veled at the abundance of fresh air cir-
culating through the room.

All of the students agreed that the
Cathedral is an ideal place in which to
study.

George Schwartz and Melvin Caplin,
Middlers in the School of Law, both
agreed that they liked the atmosphere
of the Nationalities Room and felt quite
proud of the fact that they were among
the first students actually to use the
Chinese seminar table.

Parents Council Will Hold
Final Meeting On Tuesday

At this time of the year all campus
organizations plan for their ﬁnale. The
University Parents Council anticipates
things a little by announcing that the
last meeting of the year will be held
in Room 1309, Cathedral, at 7:45
o’clock next Tuesday. Dr. John J.
Geise, assistant professor of history,
will discuss, “Why Do Students
Study?”

The Parents Council is an informal
organization of parents of undergrad-
uate women and holds monthly ineet-
ings with the faculty of the University
to discuss educational and social prob-
lems of special interest.

PANHEI. COUNCIL SETS
APRIL 20 AS SING DATE

Convention Attendance Opposed
In Interfraternity Meeting

Since postponenients are in order
with most campus organizations, Pan-
hellenic Council, too, has postponed its
annual interfraternity sing and stunt
night to Monday, April 20. The cup
has been obtained, the judges selected,
and the women's fraternities have called
practice after practice but the crowded
social calendar of Heinz House will
not permit an earlier date.

At the recent Council meeting, a dis-
cussion ensued whether or not to send
a University delegate to the Urban
Panhellenic Convention at Ohio State
University, Columbus. Last year’s con-
ference was held in Pittsburgh.

Council weighed the advantages and
disadvantages of local representation
at the annual conference. Since the
leaders at these conventions usually
are unsuccessful in guiding the group
away from discussing rushing tactics,
little else is accomplished. Then, too,
the Panhellenic organization at the
University has 3. well planned rushing
system which sharply contrasts with
those of other universities. Some of
the Panhelleiiic councils have rotation
of officers and. due to frequent resigna-
tions, are further handicapped.

What? A Queenless Ball?

It_has,been customary to send the
president of this year’s Council and the
incoming head as delegates. Further
complications were involved since the
conference will be held‘ April .16, I7,
and 18. Since the Panhellenic Ball is
scheduled for April 17, sending dele-
gates would result in a queenless ball.
Therefore Betty Kelley, C37,‘ vice
president and social chairman, moved
that a representative should not be sent
to the 1936 conference. Members of
the Council unanimously approved the
motion.

Pledge supervisers lunclied at Heinz
H0153‘? Yesterday at 12:30 o’clock. A
meeting followed the luncheon and
lasted until 2:30 o’clock.

A brief meeting will be held today
at 12:30 o’clock in Heinz House, and
nominations for officers will be ap-
proved by Council representatives.
Tickets for the Panhellenic Ball will
also be distributed.

Local Avukah To Entertain
Philadelphia Representatives

Plans for the entertainment of the
two representatives from the main
chapter in Philadelphia, of Avukah,

burgh chapter at the next meeting, will

tomorrow evening at 8:30 o’clock at
the YM-YWHA.

Saul Fineberg, BA38, program chair-
man, will present a special orientation
program on the history and principles
of Avukali. All present and prospective
members are invited to attend.
