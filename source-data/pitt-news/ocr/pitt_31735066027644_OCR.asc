Frogger on Bigelow:
The street-crossing
game to continue

Corrine LaFata
For The Pitt News

Why isn’t it closed?

Frisbee throwers and
hackey—sackers had a free run
of Bigelow Boulevard last
September during a 30-day
trial closing of the street.

The trial closing brought
onto the street students who
skateboarded, chatted and
even juggled without fear of
being hit by a car.

But the boulevard didn't
remain closed. Instead, plans
were made to narrow Bigelow
down to two lanes of traffic.
Construction was projected to
begin in late August. A

But the motion to narrow

' Bigelow was tabled by City

Council unanimously in late
July. It seems that taxpayers
were unwilling to foot the
$450,000 bill that would pay

.began

for the narrowing of the street.

One of these taxpayers is
Marshall Goodwin, president
of the Oakland Community
Council. His reason for oppos-
ing the closure are simple.

"The main problem we
had with it was the use of city
money for the University," he
said.

For years the group had
worked to improve certain
areas in Oakland. He said the
city planning department hired
experts from outside the city
to study which areas needed
improvement. Bigelow
Boulevard was not on the list.

But the main roads into
Oakland, such as Bates Street,
the Boulevard of the Allies,
Forbes Avenue, Centre Avenue
and Craig Street, did make the
list. The planning department

improve the areas, but when it

approached City Council with
the plans, it was told there was
no money available for such
improvements.

"Two months later, [City
Council] said they were
spending $450,000 on

Bigelow. We got mad," said
Goodwin. "We took the issue
to City Council and it was
tabled.''

Ken Service, Pitt's official
spokesman, has a different
take on the story.

"We agreed to the compro-
mise [to narrow instead of
close], thinking that the city
would help pay. When we

Eureka! Smoking is found to be bad

Ex-smokers are still likely to develop lung cancer

Hillary Stevenson

Staff Writer

On their way to class, thou-
sands of Pitt students carry their
books in one hand and hold onto
a cigarette with the other.

They light up before and
after class, trying to ease them-
selves of the pressures of college
life. Easing stress, they say, out-
weighs the beneﬁts of quitting.

Unfortunately for them,
recent studies by a Pitt professor
suggest that smokers are still
likely to contract lung cancer,
even if they were to quit today.

Dr. Jill Siegfried, associate
professor of pharmacology and
director of basic science at the
Pitt Cancer Institute's Lung
Cancer Center, found that smok-
ing for at least 25 years increas-

es the reproduction of lung cells.
The rapid growth of lung cells
can lead to lung cancer.

The reproduction of lung
cells might begin much sooner
than 25 years, though, she noted.

The growth process begins
with a gastrin-releasing peptide
receptor that is on the surface of
lung cells. These receptors then
capture various hormones. Once
this occurs, lung cells will
divide. The new cells may con-
tinue to bear the gastrin-releas-
ing receptors, which capture
more hormones, eventually
leading to lung disease.

Siegfried said this process is
permanent and could explain
why ‘long-term ex-smokers
develop lung cancer, even if
they hadn't had a cigarette in
years.

"For the ex-smoker, this is a
vicious cycle, because it doesn't
matter if they stopped smoking.
Once the process is activated,
it's permanent," Siegfried said.

She started her research ﬁve
years ago. It has involved 37
subjects. Some subjects . just
started smoking, while others
had smoked for at least 25 years.
Only one subject didn't smoke.

Siegfried warned that this

processmay not apply to only“

smokers. It is possible that it
could occur in anyone who has a
genetic predisposition toward
lung disease or who has con-
tracted lung disease in a way
other than smoking.

Young smokers should pay
attention to ﬁndings such as
these, advised Siegfried.

  More classes created to handle

extra-Iarge freshman class

Mike Swanson

I needed,"
biology lab sections up to the last’

Staff Writer

Because of the immense fresh-
man class enrolled at Pitt this year,
students are not only living in
tighter quarters but are feeling the
squeeze in the classroom as well.

Freshman enrollment this year
is around 2,475,’ up 338 from last
year's 2,137. Because of this, class-
es that are generally small, such as
those in the math and language
departments, arernow six to 15 stu-
dents’ larger than normal.

"Some math classes have gone
from an enrollment of 30 students
to up around 45," said Fred Koloc,
CAS director of advising.

To accommodate the larger
number of students, certain science
departments were forced to add
more class sections and labs‘ so that
already existing ones would not
need to add more students.

"More sections of biology and
chemistry classes and labs. were
added so that students would not
have to wait to get classes they
said Koloc. "We added

day before classes started to
accommodate students." '
Other are-as thatfelt the pres-
sure of the giant freshman class
were the psychology, anthropology,
and English departments.
Introductory classes such as
Psychology 0015 and Introduction
to Cultural Anthropology expanded
their enrollment so that students
could get the classes they "desired.
The English department also felt
the pressure to create as many
General Writing sections as possi-
ble this semester, although not
everyone was satisfied. -

“General Writing was the only/

class I couldn’t get into because it
was overcrowded,” said freshman
Carlee Clement. ,

‘While mostidepartments were
able to ‘accommodate the large
incoming class, the department
offering General Writing Intensive
classes could not adjust its pro-
grams as well as other departments
did. Due to ‘financial and educa-
tional reasons, the number of stu-
dents in GWI classes did not
increase. .

"The 37 sections of GWI could
not be increased without taking
away from the quality of instruc-
tion students receive," "said

"Margaret Marshall of the GWI pro-

gram. ,
The Freshman Studies program
was one of the areas hit hardest by
the larger freshman class. Since
most students take the course in
their first semester,
nine new classes
had to be added this
term, bring the total
to 79, to keep the
class sizes relatively
small. '
“Normally the
class size is 20 or
less. This year it is

   

    said"

, Classes, like this freshman studies class, have gotten’Iarger this year.

School and Freshman Studies,
though, the department was able‘ to

‘cover the expenses of the new

classes with the current budget.
Students and departments are
 ‘ not the only ones
feeling pressure from
the increased enroll-
ment. .

Center has had to

Susan Harkins, with other depart-
director of the CAS ments to create more

Program, “but I
don’t think the size
will affect the quali-
ty of the class. The
most difficult area -
was finding class-
rooms, but we
received great coop-
eration from other
departments.”

While the addi-
tion of more classes helped accom-
modate the students, there was a
concern the departments that creat-
ed the new classes might be finan-
cially strained. A

According to Jackie Batt, assis-
tant director of College—in-High-

of students allowed
to enroll in current
‘ones. Also, most
advisers had to han-
dle more students
than in previous
years and worked
longer hours during
the summer advising
sessions. ’
"During some advis-
ing sessions, we had 12 students to
an adviser, up from eight the previ-
ous years," said Koloc. "We had a
lot of help from the departments,

though, so we could accommodate’

everyone. I think we rose to the
occasion, though."

Across the Nation

FELLSMERE, Fla. — Two people
were killed when a teenage driver
attempted to fix her hair.

According to Florida Highway
Patrol troopers, the 16-year-old driver
asked a passenger to take control of the
car while traveling on Interstate 95. He

was unable to control the car. It.

swerved off the road and ﬂipped over.

Troopers said that the 18-year old
who had taken control of the car was
killed along with another 18-year old
who was thrown from the car, run over
by a tractor trailer, and then struck by
another car.

The driver was the only survivor

he crossed the picket line in Miami.

The bill would call for possible

LOS ANGELES, Ca. — The world got
its first look at the future of reusable
unmanned spacecraft yesterday.

The U.S. Air Force and Boeing
presented their prototype of the new

a space maneuver vehicle. It’s shaped

like a cigar and has short stubby wings.
The craft is 22 feet long and weighs
just over a ton.

The spacecraft is designed to carry
out reconnaissance and place small
satellites in orbit.

The designers said the actual craft
will be slightly larger than the proto-

, type, and will be launched into space

by a rocket or space shuttle.
It will stay in orbit for a year and
then land on its own. - ‘

cer, but people need to look at the psy-
chological and the physiological aspects

of smoking," said David Floy, a Pitt post- ‘

graduate student. "We need to note that
the people who don't smoke arestill sus-
ceptible to lung cancer."

Research like Siegfried's combats
the sense of invincibility that many
young smokers have, according to senior
Allison Luongo. .

Freshman Mike Haynie is one smok-
er who feels invincible.

"I've only‘ been smoking since this
summer, and research like this doesn't
"bother me. As long as my life is stressful,
I'll smoke and then try stopping in a few
years," Haynie said. ' '

For junior Christa Douaihy, a mem-
ber of SGB, smoking helps curb the
stress in her life.

"It's not like we're naive. We know

 
 

    

I 3

it's bad for us, but we
can't afford to quit. For
me and my stressful
work of being on.SGB,
it's a necessity," she said.

The urge to smoke
can be greater than some
of life's necessities.

"I've gone a week
without grocery shop-
ping just so I could
afford a pack of ciga-
rettes," said Luongo.

Another student,
Rebecca Barnberger,
said she has seen what
can happen after years of
smoking.

"I've seen a black lungin an anato- they have lun
my lab, and I don't want that to happen to

me," she said. .

Many students say quit-
ting smoking is a cost-
benefit judgment —
either they quit and
become irritable and more
stressed, or they continue
to smoke and risk future
health problems.

."It's conflicting. I know
people in their ' eighties
and nineties who have
been smoking all of their
lives and who don't have

lung cancer," said Dawn ‘

Papuga, a sophomore.

"I know younger people
‘who have been smoking
for only a few years, and

g cancer"
These observations illustrate the
complexity of this issue.

Bookstore blues: Try to endure it

A prayer to the football
gods: Please save us!

Most Honoured Football Gods:

First off, we at the University of Pittsburgh have been try-
ing to get in touch with you for four years. Where have you
been? Why didn’t you ret11m our phone calls?

And how do you justify that loss to Temple two years ago?

Anyway, on to more pressing matters. As you and any other
life form with a pulse have probably realized, we don’t have a
shot in hell of winning against Penn State this Saturday without
your benevolent touch. We humbly request your omnipotent
presence at State College this weekend as we embark on our
crusade for gridiron respectability. .

Okay, forget respectability. We want a win. A good old-

fashioned demolition of the Nittany Lions. Straight out of the
1970s — when Pitt had a powerful football program and Joe
Patemo was, well, still old. .

In exchange for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, we at
The Pitt News will oﬂ’er the following modest sacriﬁces:

,-IfPitt beats Penn State, we will publish an opinions col-
umn apologizing to that school for our University’s shameless
abasing of their ﬁne athletic programs and their, well, uhhh, ade-
quate academics.

.0 Should Pitt win, we the editors promise to begin trans-
porting. the Cathedral of Learning — brick by brick, by hand -
to the State College campus, where it will be rebuilt in the shape
of a giant kitty cat, er, Nrttany Lion. ,

- We will humbly accept a win Saturday in exchange for a
winless record to follow for the rest of the season. In exchange
for a blowout, we offer a winless record for the rest of the
decade. We will happily accept a winless record for eternity if
Joe Patemo gets ﬁred Did we mention he’s old? _

' 0 To demonstrate our humility toward your most kind and
honoured lords, we will take no credit for the win. All credit will
be given to Notre Dame for allowing us to borrow their colors.

As you can surely see, this is a most important game to our
meek souls. But we need your help.

Please Football Gods, save us.

While I stood waiting in
line, I looked up just in time
to see - Shakespeare and
Thoreau ﬂip off of the
counter as they got ready to
head out the door.

And that pretty much
summed up the day’s mood
in Pitt’s bookstore.

The girl who had just
bought those two books, and

others in a pile that closely _

resembled the humanities
of, the Carnegie
Library in size and content,
looked about ready to do
some ﬂipping off of her
own.

But the perennial exodus
of 25,000 persons into the
narrow checkout stalls of
bookstores around Oakland
is as muchan essential and

fun factlof life as clipping.

your toenails or having your
wisdom teeth. pulled. (And
that’s not to say you should
onlylclip your toenails twice
a year or could have your
wisdom teeth pulled more
than once.)

The common phenome-
non of the University’s cir-
culating “the wrong copy?’
of a required text to non-
University-affiliated book-
stores and providing certain
texts at Pitt’s bookstore
doesn’t work to make the
lines any shorter, either.

After years of hearing

- clerks in crowded .off-cam-

pus bookstores shouting
“You mean they’re offering
a ‘Party Dance’ {class at

Pitt?” (and Pitt does - if you
think I’m kidding, check out
CRN number 35231 in the
co-ed physical education
department), many students
turned to looking in Pitt’s
bookstore for their course
materials and an oasis from
ridicule.

, Here, while they may

still laugh at you for taking
Country Western Dance
(CRN 27799 in guess-which
department), at least they’ll
be desensitized to the ques-
tion and not to drop to the
ﬂoor convulsing with laugh-
ter.
_ On the positive side, the
waiting-line entertainment
has come a long way in the
past four years,

A poster for'the Texas
Instruments’ 6000XX super-
computing calculator near
the checkout proved to me
that some mathematics
equations can look a lot like

_ Van Gogh’s “Starry Night.”

(If you think I’m kidding,
head over to the Schenley
Quadrangle entrance of the
bookstore and look for your-
self.) '

Rumor has it that the
calculator can also baby-sit
your kids, redirect the path
of nuclear warheads in mid-
ﬂight and correctly operate
the Mir -space station.
Chances are still pretty good
that the average college stu-

_ dent buying it can’t get it to

show the graph for a high-
school algebra equation.
These calculators are
moody like that.
The waiting—1ine master-

THE PITT NEWS

piece also demonstrated that
no matter how much the 70
pounds of books in my arms
would teach me, I’d still
probably never do advanced
calculus as well as a 1/4-
inch microchip.

That, in addition to a
‘squishy Dilbert stress doll
and a sample laundry- mark-
ing pen, kept me and the 50-
some other students in my
line occupied for the 53
minutes it took to move 30
feet. The despondent and
ennui-encrusted faces of
those trapped in the line
beside mine looked on in
frustration as we — in a
“Lord of the Flies” kind of
way — bondedgduring those
simple pleasures.

It is times like these that
certainly do try men’s souls.

Still, I’m glad waiting
for books isn’t as bad as it
was for many of our parents
and grandparents.
According to no more than
two and no less than one.Pitt
graduate of years gone by,
students had to walk, three
miles in bare feet through
hurricanes and tornadoes
' (once indigenous to the. hilly
western Pennsylvania
region) to buy their books.

Interestingly, the book-

’ return procedure was report-

edly a little faster back then.
After signing another
receipt that looked like

' Pittsburgh’s contribution to

eliminating the national
debt, another miracle
occurred: Everything I had
just bought shrunk enough

Don't ignore the freshman; They're not dumb, just lost

Jennifer

 

Stoltz

It was like walking head-on into
a natural disaster. People wandering
aimlessly left and right. Clothes and
other various pieces of debris strewn
every which way. Voices raised in
protest, everyone lugging carts with

all their worldly belongings encased,

within. Interestingly enough, it was-
n’t a ﬂood or storm‘ that had caused
this mass pandemonium. It was
moving day for freshmen.

Even though I live only 20 min-
utes from campus, I chose to live in
the residence halls. I wanted the
simpler hours and the extra—resource
availability that residence living
offered. I give commuters a lot of
credit for sitting in the student union
those extra hours until their buses
arrive, .,_or for hastily returning to
campus for a study ‘session long
after classes end. But as I entered
the hall of my “castle suite,” I won-
dered what exactly I had gotten

_ myself into.

Due to my extra time spent liv-
ing the day—to-day life of a new col-

‘lege student, I have had many new

and interesting. experiences. I now
know for certain that I made the
right decision in choosing Pitt for
my undergraduate studies. . The
University really fosters a mission
of safety, personal and intellectual

New uniforms?
Now how about
some gross?

With all of the improvements
currently going, into Pitt’s football
facilities, when is someone going to
propose the best improvement of all
— tearing up the artiﬁcial turf and
installing natural grass. Clearly,
players are increasingly favoring
grass over turf, and such a move
should help «recruiting enormously.
Many other major programs, such as
Michigan, Ohio State, Texas, and
Texas A&M, have gone back to
grass in recent years, and it is time
for Pitt to make a similar move.

growth, along with personal atten-
tion for its students, or at least as
much personal attention as one can
get in a school this big. These con-
cepts really turned me on to Pitt,
knowing that I’d get the best of both
worldsin some ways.

I’ve spent a lot of time observ-
ing things in the interim period
between my arrival and the start of
classes, and I’m happy with what
I’ve seen. Mostly. There are some
people who unfortunately don’t
seem to share the University’s ideals

.‘— especially concerning freshmen.

I’d like to consider myself an
intelligent individual. That is why,
shortly after my arrival, I was puz-
zled and aggravated by the fact that
more than one person insisted on
speaking to me as if Ihad a very
small vocabulary. Either that, or
they thought I wasn’t a member of
their species.

I haven’t been the only one who

has noticed this. Another freshman, '

who was rather lost trying to find
her first class, was basically insulted
by someone when she askedifor
directions. Looking for an upper
floor in the maze ‘of that building,
the person was short and impatient
with her. Granted, there are close to
3,000 swarming freshman all look-
ing for destinations that they can’t
find, but‘ an honest question
deserves an honest answer.

ticket sales are
a sham .

I recently received’ in the
mail a Pittsburgh Panther sched-
ule and an order form for tickets.
My wife and I decided that we
would like to attend the Notre
Dame game. I would have pre-
ferred not sitting in the student
section, but when I calledfor
information on‘the tickets, I was
informed that they were avail-
able only in a package deal —— in
which I was not interested. I then
proceeded to mail in the order
form along with a check for $14
($7 per ticket) for tickets in the

student section.. .   ....

think that he is capable of writing

name on official
forms. It had already
been established

beyond a reasonable
doubt that I was not
an imposter, because
I have joined the
ranks of other Pitt
students by carrying
my ID as if it were
surgically attached to
me.

Despite this indis-
putable fact, many
people, in separate
instances, have close-
ly scrutinized my sig-
nature, or even my ID
picture, a lot longer
than is necessary, as
if I were posing as
someone else. I real-
ize my picture is not
the most ﬂattering in the world, _but
I hope it isn’t quite as distorted as
some made it out to be.

Most upperclassmen have been

extremely helpful and friendly, I
was pleasantly surprised to learn.
But, there are those who slam right
into us because they were looking at

something interesting on their shoes
and then walk away muttering,
“Freshmen.” While that statement
was‘, after all, a very
astute observation, it
really has nothing to
do with not watching
where one is going.
Meeting people has
been an interesting
experience since I
arrived. Sitting down
in one of my classes, I
began talking to the
person beside me.
The conversation was
going rather well
until the student
asked me, “So, what
year are you in?” As
soon as I answered,
the person replied
with an “Oh.” You
know, the all—know—
ing, monosyllabic “so
that explains it” reply.
Somehow I think a
judgment on my intel-
ligence was made in
that moment.

Even though many of us are
legal adults, or within weeks of
becoming so, some people still
choose to treat us as if we were
beginning elementary school,
instead of college. For the most part,

' Pittsburgh, PA 15260.

Letters should be kept to 250 words and must
include the writer’s name, phone number, and

    

university affiliation (if any). g

These are the complaints I
ave: _
- I think that it is unfairto force
a package deal on a student who
wishes to attend only a single

‘game. This offer makes perfect

sense for the general public, but
it should not be imposed on
tuition—paying students of the
University.

- What I encountered at the tick-
et office in the WPU when I went
to pick up my tickets was shock-
ing. I was told at that time that
my tickets weren’t in and that
they wouldn’t be in until a :week
before the game. I was also
informed that the cost was $15 a
ticket, not $7 as advertised. The
person I spoke to then handed
me my check and order form

(which was retrieved from a,
..la_rge.stack of others), and sug-

 

gested that I just stop in before
the game to attempt to buy my
tickets.

These are my questions:
- Why mail out order forms with
inaccurate prices if indeed there
is no way to secure tickets?

- Why make this system so diffi-

cult and incomprehensible?»

I find it difficult to believe
that the University complains of
low attendance and student apa-
thy. I think a large part of the
problem may be the ticket-acqui-
sition process. I cannot say I will
ever attempt to purchase tickets
again. Intelligent, organized
people do not appreciate a
runaround or expensive scams
intended to sell more tickets.

The students deserve better. _

to fit into one plastic bag. By the
time I got home and took out the

books for my classes, many ofthe V

texts had already begun to decay
into a pile of those tiny little sub-
scription cards that seem to make
up the bulk of ‘most magazines
today.

That has to do
largely with quantum
physics, ' and partially
with economics, I
think.

Still, once home,
there. is much to be
learned from your
books —— even before
classes start. A quick
glance at the cover of
any of the textbooks
that cost as much as
the down payment on
your first car will
reveal one of several
things;

- 1) Your instructor’s name.

‘ 0 2) The name of your instructor’s
' friend at Harvard.

0 3) A great, and usually dead,
world—renowned author’s name.

'0 4) What edition ‘it is, and thus the
reason why you couldn’t buy it used
and for half of what you just paid.
0 5) The overall entertainment fac-
tor of the book.

Unfortunately, in college at
least, you can tell a book by_its
cover. For example, the book
“Theoretical Discussions on the

Post’-Reconstruction Era’s Impact

in the Euro-Indonesian - Foot-
Deodorizer Market” may not ‘have
an entertainment factor as great as,
let’s say, “Sex, Drugs and Rock’ and

  

He said T

Eighties -Than You Think.”

° 6) The overall practical-education -

factor of the book. In this category,
a book such as your Calc 17 class’s
text wouldn’t score as high _as
, something as short as

' - “Don’t Slow Down:
TheMotorist’s Guide
for Driving Through
Tunnels.”

0 7) The utility factor
of the book.

A 3,000-page biolo-
gy text, as a case in
point, has a much
greater ability than
does a copy of Strunk
and ' White’s
“Elements of Style”
to stop a bullet fired
from those dimly lit
and
neighborhoods behind Trees Hall. A
good, solid copy of “Moby Dick”
also makes a great bludgeoning
device and may deter criminals just
on sight.

So as we pack ‘em up and head

out toward that big Valhalla of,

academia in the sky (or Clapp Hall,
which is where you_’re more likely
to find a scheduled class,) rest
assured in knowing that you will
reap untold fortunes and priceless
knowledge from those hallowed
texts this semester.

And $12.31 when you sell them
all back in December. -

this isn’t true. But we are not ignor-_

ing the «fact that many do .interact
with us in that manner.

While I have had no problem
getting my questions answered here
at the University, there have been
times when the answer would
inevitably be preceded with, “Oh, a

freshman.” It got to the point where_

my parents had to call, because
these particular people thought I
didn’t understand plain English.
And then, upon calling, no doubt the
same person began their reply with,
“Well, mom ....” N_ot exactly polite,
if you ask me.

Now, I understand that we fresh-
men are far from perfect. But
nobody’s perfect. We also know that
some people may have had night-
mare experiences with freshmen.
But we’re not all like that. Pitt has
beengreat to us, preparing us and

informing us as to all the things
both they and we can do to enrich
our years here. I think it’s safetto
say that we appreciate it and want to
take advantage of it.

As of August 21, we were 3,227
strong — so you won’-t really be
able to avoid us. Yes, we are con-
fused, and definitely disoriented.
Maybe even scared in some
respects. But, just to clear up some
misconceptions, we are not by any
means lacking in brain capacity,

totally uncoordinated, or your sub-

ordinate in any other way except our
age. Weare here to learn and carve
the path to our future, not to make
your lives miserable. Remember,

us; you were a freshman, too.

Panthers enter

religious realm
of PS U football

There is nothing worse than bad timing.

. Alanis Monisette preached about lousy
things happening at the most inopportune
times, except she dubbed them “Ironic.”

There is nothing ironic about Saturday’s
matchup between Pitt and intrastate rival
Penn State.

This is an extreme case of bad timing.

This summer, the Panthers’ new head
coach, Walt Harris, admitted that he didn’t
look forward to playing Penn State this sea-
son, or in the near future for that matter. He
said give him a few years and then he’d like
to face the upper—echelon teams like the
Nittany Lions. 9

Who could blame him.

Penn State is a program on an entirely
different level than is Pit1sburgh’s. This
rivalry exists in the hearts and minds of
Panther and Lion faithful, not on the ﬁeld
anymore.

The on-the-ﬁeld rivalry stalled in the late
‘80s, when Pitt suddenly missed the boat on
many aspectsofthegarnethatarevitaltoa
successful program.

Stability at the head-coach position was
pathetic at best as Pitt saw the likes of Foge
Fazio, Mike Gottfried and Paul Hackett
roam the sidelines, but on December 20,
1989, the football program took its ﬁrst
steps into what would become an unstop-
pable downward spiral.

Gottfried led Pitt to an 8-2-1 record in the
1989 season, but right before the Panthers
were set to faceTexasA&M inthelohn
Hancock Bowl, he resigned and handed the
reigns to Hackett. '

Pitt handled the Aggies 31-28, but since
then the Panthers have won only 24 con-
tests while losing 53 and tying one.

Since 1990, Penn State has won 69
games while winding up on the losing end
a mere 19 times.

T _ Football at Penn State is religion.
9 Beaver Stadium is the hallowed hall of
the congregation.
V Joe Patemo is the omnipotent God

Football at Pittsburgh, on the other hand,
is a chore.

Pittsburgh Stadium is an outdated,
scarcely populated inconvenience thrown
onto the middle of a hill.

However, Walt Harris looks to be the sav-
ior of the thousands of gridiron atheists
throughout western Pennsylvania

With the help of his co-pastor in crime
' V Steve Pederson, Pittsburgh looks to be on

- the way back to respectability.

Pitt is undefeated, and Penn State
hasn’t even won a single game all sea-
son. So why are the Nittany Lions 32-
point favorites in Saturday’s game in
Happy Valley? Curtis Enis, Brandon
Short, Aaron Collins, and Joe Patemo,
that’s why.

This is what you call a big game.
Not only is Penn State the No. 1-
ranked team in the entire nation, but
one of the greatest college football
rivalries of all time will be reborn
when the two teams clash in Beaver
Stadium.

The Panthers, fresh off of a 45-13
win over the Southwestern Louisiana
Ragin’ Cajuns in their season opener
and complete with a new coach, a new
logo, and, most importantly, a new
attitude, are still overwhelming
underdogs.

Pitt is overmatched at virtually
every position, but the Panthers are
not about to storm into this contest

Thursday, 4 September 1997

Pittsburgh native Gibson (#94) should see action versus PSU’s imposing front five.

coaching staff will make absolutely
sure that the team is as ready as possi-
ble come kickoff.

“I’m excited about the challenge,
and it’s a big challenge,” Harris said.
“They.’re a talented team with a great
football coach.”

Obviously, Penn State is a
tremendous football team, and play-
ing against the nation’s top team is
always an attention-grabbing affair.
But make no mistake about it, it’s the
tradition and the rivalry that will
make Saturday special.

The two teams have squared off

92 times, with Penn State leading the
series 47-41-4. The rivalry dates back
to 1893, but they haven’t played each
other since 1992. '
Although it will argue otherwise,
(Patemo’s “Pitt turned us down and
decided they wanted to be more inter-
ested in Big East basketball” is close
to the official party line), Penn State
is ultimately responsible for breaking
up the annual epic clash when it
joined the Big Ten Conference, leav-
ing no room for Pitt on the Nittany

Patemo, Penn State not taking Pitt lightly

Leadership. Experience.
Power. Energy. Desire. Something
to prove.

Any time an upcoming oppo-
nent sounds like the text of an
Army recruiting poster, there may
be trouble ahead.

Pitt goes looking for trouble at
Penn State this weekend — where,
not by coincidence, many local
products and some of the nation’s
top talent have been recruited.

In his 32nd year as fie1dgener—
al at Happy Valley, Joe Paterno
earned an honor this season he’d
never received before —- the No. 1
ranking in the Associated Press

‘ Top-25 poll. It is his national title

to lose, and _he is ready to prove

 

his team’s might with PSU’s sea-
son opener this weekend. _

“We are zeroing in on this
game,” he said. “We are trying to
be healthy for this game and, I
think, we will play as well as we
possibly couldxplay for an opening
game this Saturday.”

Patemo has been the unques-
tioned leader of Penn State foot-
ball since the Vietnam conﬂict, but
his ability to foster a senior-player
leadership dates back almost as
long.

On defense, redshirt senior

Aaron Collins already has a degree -

in education from the university.
The outside linebacker registered
75 tackles last season — his sec-
ond as a starter. He also took home
second-team All-Big-10 honors.

45‘-..».-. "l. .2.‘   

Jim Nelson, also a senior,
starts at the other outside ‘backer
position. Both are quick enough to
cover tight ends and running backs
in the ﬂat — bad news for the
West Coast—offense-oriented
Panthers. Nelson was second on
the team in tackles. Collins tied
for the team lead in pass breakups
with 14.

By the way, Nelson’s father is
an Air Force officer.

Linebacker U. fills out its line-
backing corps with Brandon Short,
a 6-3, 240-pound redshirt sopho-
more who earned All-America
honors at nearby McKeesport
High.

Pittsburgh, Syracu

We’re getting deep enough into
the season to see some good, big-
name matchups this week. Three
games will pit top-25 teams against
each other. Being in Pennsylvania,
you wouldn’t know that. Even if
you did, you wouldn’t care, because
the only game that matters around
here is...

Pittsburgh (+32) at Penn State
I admit that I was pretty

' impressed by the Panthers’ showing

last week. In past years, Pitt had the
annoying habit of staying close to

tough teams in the first half, only to ‘

get blown out in the second half. It
was nice to turn the tables on some-
one. Nobody expects the Panthers
to win this week, but if they stick
close in the first half, which is a
possibility, Penn State might not be
able to get quite as much of a
blowout as the expect.

Penn State 38, Pittsburgh 13

Indiana (+29) at North Carolina
Oh, if only it were basketball
season. These are two of the coun-
try’s most storied basketball pro-
grams. At North Carolina, unlike
Indiana, football recently has quiet-
ly crept into the spotlight. Believe it
or not, the Tar Heels are ranked sev-
enth in the country. This “football”
thing is an epidemic spreading

 
    

THE PITT

. .MoAx
through the ACC like something
from a bad movie. Speaking of bad,
let’s talk about Hoosier football.
Indiana’s football team is much
closer to the bottom seven in the
country than the top seven. They
always have been, and they proba-
bly always will be.

North Carolina 41, Indiana 6

Syracuse at Oklahoma (+10)

If there’s any school that knows
about choking, it’s Syracuse. Every
year, the football team is talented
enough to win the Big East, then it
goes out and loses early in the sea-
son to some team that stinks, like
Minnesota last season, or North
Carolina State last week. The
Orangemen also bounce back every
season. Oklahoma was 3-8 last year.
Not long ago, that kind of showing
would have been absolutely
unthinkable for a Sooner squad.
They’re in a rebuilding period, and
Syracuse is not the kind of team you
want to play if you’re rebuilding.

Washington at Brigham Young
(+7)

BYU is ranked No. 19 in the lat-
est AP poll, primarily on the basis
of their 14-1 season last year.
Without quarterback Steve
Sarkisian, the Cougars have to
depend on their running game.
Unfortunately, they haven’t had an
effective running back since
Brigham Young himself. As for
Washington, there is no ‘way that.
that team will allow itself to lose
before its big showdown against
Nebraska.

Washington 28, BYU 10

Colorado State (+16) at Colorado
You have to love a game
between two top-25 teams from the
same state. Normally, when the No.
24 team in the country is getting 16
points, I’d say take it, but this is no
ordinary game. Colorado is current-
ly ranked eighth in the AP poll,
making it quite possibly the best
No. 8 team in history. Colorado
State did well to crack the rankings
before this game, because it won’t
be back after its over.

of thumb about ranked teams get-
ting points holds true. USC is No.
23, Florida State No. 5. The Los
Angeles Coliseum is not the most
intimidating college football site in
the world (or even in the L.A. area),
but the Trojans should be pumped
for a home game against an oppo-
nent of this quality. Maybe not
pumped enough to win outright, but
enough to be close.

Florida State 27,--USC 21

This week’s best bet:
Auburn at Virginia (+3)

He’s not Peyton Manning, he’s
not Donovan McNabb, but Auburn’s
Dameyune Craig could be the
nation’s third—best quarterback. He
could beat plenty of teams all by
himself. He doesn’t need to,
because the Tigers have 10 return-
ing starters on defense, but he
could. I can’t figure out why
Auburn is only a three-point
favorite here, but it’s not my job to
figure that out. It’s just my job to
tell you that Auburn is going to win
by a lot more than three.

isn’t enough to revive the heathens who
have lost their faith in Pittsburgh football,
and it deﬁnitely isn’t enough to start them
speaking in blue-and-white tongues like
their zealous central-state counterparts.

In fact, Pittsburgh might never have what
Penn State has to offer to incoming players:
0 Consistent winning that is unparalleled.

0 The 96,000-plus fans, week in and week
out, who live vicariously through their leg-
endary coach.

- The opportunity to win a national champi-
onship every time they begin a new season.

These are only a few of the sights that
Pittsburgh has its collective eye on.

It won’t be easy, and neither will
Saturday, but we have to start somewhere.

There really is no answer as to what
Pittsburgh can do to improve across the
board, but the right people are in the right
places to make things happen.

Hopefully, when Patemo walks away
from the sidelines, the new head coach in
Happy Valley will feel the need to make a
name for himself. Hopefully, Joe Pa’s suc-
cessor will be more lenient and understand-
ing when it comes to negotiating a deal to
keep the series alive. ‘

Lions’ schedule.

“The rivalry means a lot,” Pitt
defensive tackle and Pittsburgh native
Demond Gibson‘ said. “I look at it as
another chance to go out there and
have some fun.”

Even linebacker Ernest Coakley, a
New York native, knows that this
rivalry has some historical signifi-
cance.

“For me, it’s an adopted rivalry,”
he said. “From what I’ve heard, it’s
like F1orida—Florida State and
Alabarna-Auburn.”

Coach Harris has never been
directly involved with this rivalry, but
he is well aware of its signiﬁcance.

“I honestly don’t know that much
about it, it’s more of an alumni thing,”
the head coach explained. “But I have
watched it on TV. It was always late
November, two teams in a great bat-
tle.”

Battle is right. If the Panthers are
going to have any chance against the
Lions, Quarterback Pete Gonzalez is
going to have to step up and turn in
another great performance. Last week,
the senior was 16 for 30 for 210 yards
and two touchdowns through the air.

FROM PAGE 12

    

He also ran for 73 yards, including a _

16-yard touchdown scramble.

Pitt will field primarily the same
starting lineup as it did against the
Ragin’ Cajuns. The only new face will
be redshirt sophomore guard Justin
Wade, who will be filling in for senior
Reggie Thomas, who injured his knee
in last week’s game.

U speaks - a report
by The Daily Collegian

From our friends at The Daily
Collegian — Geoﬁ‘ Mosher, Sports
Editor '

So. You want your school’s name
lengthened now. How about ArmPitt
or Pittifull or Pittfall? Maybe SPitt.

And y’a1l think this brand new
name and logo is supposed to be
attractive to new recruits? Maybe
now you’ll stop losing them to us.

And you think a new coach spells
relief from the horror that is Pitt foot-
ball?

If that’s the case, we would have
to say that Peteey Gonzalez is quite
the lucky guy these days. After all,
he’s got Walt Harris I — John
Cooper’s gift to the coaching world
—— tutoring him. And _everyone is
familiar with the star quarterbacks
Harris has helped to reach puberty.
Let’s see, there’s Tony Eason, Jack
Trudeau, Bobby Hoying and
mmmmm oh yeah, Boomer
Esiason. Now if Pete doesn’t want to
add his name to that list, he’d be bet-
ter off playing Panther football.
Ooops. Too late, Pete.

‘But seriously, nice strategy on
hiring a quarterbacks coach. Bet
that’l1 really improve your defense.
Let’s see, your team gave up 430
points in 11 games. According to our
estimations, that’s a stingy 39 points
per game. Does Walt wear a toupee?
No? A wig? Could you ask him to
bring‘ the number of his hairstylist to
the stadium Saturday? Thanks, kids.

Okay, let’s play trivia: How many
good Pittsburgh football players does

it taketo win a game?

Answer: A few, which is why
Penn State does so well. Get it?
How’s LaVar Arrington doing? Oh
wait, he’s with us. Same for Brandon
Short.

Didn’t you boyz get that one-star
recruit, the running back out of Senile
Rock, Beano Cook? Scouting report
says he’s pretty slithery between the
tackles. ‘-

Penn State. Hmmm. So I guess?

those hicks to our north want to
start a little war of words. Hey, put

. up your dukes, Jethro, Jed, Ellie

Mae and the rest of your Clampett
posse. We’re going to war.

So you want to talk about name
changes? How about “Penn State?”
Why not “Pennsylvania State?”
You guys aren’t afraid that the res-
idents of this fine commonwealth
are ashamed to have their name

emblazoned on your athletic appar- '

el, are you?

Nah.

Yet, I must admit, your Kitty
Lions do have some studly football

"players. I can only hope that the

current crop of cattle-sized
Neanderthals can parlay their
skills and continue Penn State’s
long, storied list of NFL champi-
ons. , -

Surely you remember other dis-
tinguished Penn State alumni. No?
How about Todd Blackledge, or
even Blair Thomas —_ now there is
an NFL stud.

I do often ponder how the Kitty
Lions even recruit enough-players
to field an 11-man squad, let alone
send players‘ to the pros.

Ever wonder why they ca1l_cen-

tral Pennsylvania the “Black
Hole?” Spend a week or so in
Happy Valley and you’ll soon find
out. - ‘
And let’s not forget about those

modern Penn State ‘uniforms,

Whoeey, Jethro — who was the
graphic designer who created those
works of art? Blue, white — what a

novel idea! ‘

And that racy little stripe down
the helmet really makes me get all
tingly. .

r I guess Penn State is too busy
turning out forestry and parks-and-
recreation majors to concentrate on
“academic” pursuits like graphic
arts. '

That’s okay + nobody goes to
Penn State for the education, any-
way. _

But we’ve saved my favorite
subject for last - Senor JoePa. (I
said “Senor,” not “Senior,” silly.)
JoePa is one of college football’s
winningest (and oldest) all-time
coaches. His accolades include

, four coach-of-the-year awards, two

national championships but only
one 56-18 thrashing of William
and Mary. Now that’s class, big
boy. ‘ ‘

Just this week, the Kitty Lions’
highwater—pant-wearing leader was
whining that Pitt didn’t hand over
the film from its opening-day win.

Wah-wah, Joey. This is foot-
ball, not the Book-of-the—Month
Club. .

Grow up and take it like a man.

Oh, that’s right, he is grown
up. Really, really grown up. His
first starting quarterback at -PSU
was Moses, according to our best
research. 

I hope that everyone who goes
to Beaver’ (hee, hee) Stadium this
weekend has a great time. And for

four.

But size, according to Paterno,
isn’t everything.

“We all get wrapped up in great
big guys,” said the coach. “Matt
Fornadel is a football player. If he
were 260 pounds, he might not be a
football player.”

Penn State’s offensive line has
enough size to go around and
should provide enough power to
launch Curtis Enis into open terri-
tory. Senior guard Phil Ostrowski
(6-4, 280) and redshirt freshman

tackle John Blick'(6-6, 310) make
up the “long,” or str_ong,._side of the ,

PSU front. And if Enis needs‘ any

more support, he should find it in‘ ed that he is aware of different

fullback Aaron
Harris, who" saw
playing time as a
freshman last sea-
son and who can
run and catch as ,
well as block. ’ '

faithful, Paterno
says his star back

season.
