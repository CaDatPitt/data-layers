also in other departments in which
they take courses. The faculty has

must not come from the faculty. _ It

will favor this system. ,Other schools

HOW FAR‘s.H'oULD.A . .
STUDENT, PARTICIPATE , _
IN. STUDENT ACTIVITIES

iThe question: How far should a

studentparticipate, in -thestudent ac— '

tivities of his Ltlniversity, is a question
which it is rat er difficult ‘to answer,
in many respects. Generally speak-

ing, a man should take an active part"

in as many of the student activities
as he is able to dojustice to. But
many times thestudent permits his
ambitions to get the better of him
and ‘he takes part in so maii-y college
organizations that he is unable to do
full justice to any of them, and so
scatters his:eﬁ'orts over such a‘ broad
ﬁeld that they are, to a large degree,

- lost. _ ' ..
of college
- students, namely, the man.who is too

There are two classes

lazy or _too. indifferent to tal<~e_<any
real, active interest in student ‘wfork;
the other, theman who is willing to

_ take an active part in as many ‘organ-

izations as.his fellow students wish
him to, even if in so doing he is,un—
able to do justice either to the organ-
ization or to himself. “

There are menoin the University of
Pittsburgh who are so engrossed in
student activities that they
little or no time for anything else;
men, who while doing their level ‘best,
are unable, by reason. of theﬁgreat
number of activities with which they
are connected, to do their fullest

measure of good, as they would be -
‘ able to accomplish werethey con-

centrating all _tlieir_ efforts on one or
two activities.
of PITT

It is the opinion the

- WEEKLY that it is not wide to have

‘a few men connected with all the ac-
tivities of University life and the rest
of the students sitting back with their
hands folded, perfectly contented’ to
let all the burden rest on_ ta’ few, for
the simple reason that they ‘are will-
ing to do the work. It is- far better
for every man who desires to take
part in student activities to pick out
one or two organizations with which
he desires to be aﬂiliated, and having
connected himself with these organ-
izations, let him devote his entire
time to the welfare of these, activities.
By so doing more students will be
brought into -active participation‘ in
University affairs. and 100 per cent.
more eﬁﬁciency will be added to every
organization, by reason of the con-
centrated efforts of all its members.

 

BACK AGAIN _

With opening of the baseball sea-
son over the entire circuit of. the
Major leagues yesterday, the baseball
fan «is happy once more, and from
now on" until late in ,Qctober—until
Hie ,world’s supremacy in baseball has
been decided—Mr. Fan will be in his
elements. Truly, the season of dying
grandmothers, late suppers and poor
umpires is with us again. '

Baseball is the great American
sport—there can be no doubt of this
fact. From the opening of.sea‘son

until the close‘~of the world’s series’

thousands upon thousands will attend
the games in the Major league cities,
while thousands, more will watch
minor leaguers battle, saying nothing
of'ithe amateur games all over tlw
country. Baseball is the summer
tonic of the ’_American people. It is

highly desirous that it remain the na-“

tional pastime for years to come. As
long as the game is run on a basis of
merit, so long will the .game‘be pop-
ular, but if shady» manipulation of
players and underhand_ methods are
employed by club owners, the public
will soon be aware of the fact and
the baseball stadiums’ will be empty.

Did you not-ice the baseball sched-
ule? Is. it not the best yet? And,
watch the te'am—it will be as good

‘ and‘ Gown production. .

building, dormatories, a fesidence for

 

' the Chancellor and other buildings.

This location will be within ﬁve
years the greatest institutional‘ center
in America, and’ the University will
doubtless have ﬁve thousand students
in that time.‘ , _ ._

Certainly no one will doubt the
permanency of the sUniversity and its
value to the community when busi-
ness men of the ﬁnancial caliber of

. the Mellons and the Parks -believe in

it so thoroughly, =tliat they are will-
ing to contribute such princely sums
for its increased usefulness. '

The trustees of the University have
announced a generous gift of $430,000
from Messrs. A. W. and R. B. Mellon
for the founding of what is to be
known as thelnstitution of Industrial
Research and School of Speciﬁc In-
dustries. Of this suni, $230,000 is to
be expended on building, equipment
and 1-ibrary and $200,000 is provided
for maintenance for the; ﬁrst' ﬁve
years. Thus the University will be
unable_to develop promptly and on
an extensive ‘scale the industrial re-
search laboratory now under the effi-
cient management of Prof. Robert K.
Duncan, one of America’s foremost
authorities -in industrial chemistry.

The achievements of recent years
in industrial chemistry are striking
phenomena.of the world’s applied
knowledge. iOur industrial problems
are great and our possibilities un-
limited. The University hopes to

g save the merchants of Pittsburgh and

the_ci:tizens of this community many
t'housands of dollars annually when
the smoke nuisance has been success-
fully solved. Every effort is being
put fo-rth toward the accomplishment
of this end.

The University guards the interests
and solves the problems of this vast

-population of 3,100,000 in Western

Pennsylvania and is worthy of large

. giftsfor‘ buildings and endowment.

Wealthy men have shown genuine

wisdom in. bestowing ‘their beneﬁ-'

cence to such a worthy~cause. The
trustees were gladdened soon after
the generous gift of the Mellons by
another gift from the Park heirs of
$150,000 for the erection of« two
buildings, as a memorial to their
fatherand uncle, James H. Park, ]r.,
and Captain Richard C. Gray. Each
of the structures to_ be erected will
cost $75,000. For what purpose the
buildings will be used has not been
determined. 5 ’

Other large gifts will soon be an-

nounced and with the appropriation

which the Legislature will doubtless"
.make, the University will be enabled

to do its work" under vastly more
favorable cir_cumstances.and its use-
fulness to the community, which it
serves, will be greatly increased.

MEXICO IS SUBJECT 61; ‘
ADDRESS AT ASSEMBLY

((‘ontlniued_ from Page 1)

“This was a period of great disturb-
ances, and the government was in a
turmoil during the entire time.

“It was during this period that the
United States -invaded Mexico
appropriated a large tract of land. It
is ‘a peculiar-thing that this. invasion
by the’ United States still rankles in

 

the hearts of the Mexicans, while the

invasion by the vFrench a few years
afterward has been entirely forgot-
ten. It is likely that intervention by
the United States at the present
would not be received in good spirit
by the people.” ’

Dr. Boyce characterized the reign

of Diaz as one in which the people —

were terriﬁed into submission.‘ All
manner of methods were used ‘to
make thepeople afraid of the admin-
istrat-ion. The result was that after
many years the people were unable
any longer to» stand the working of
the man Diaz and result was that fin-
der -Madero they rose and put him
out ofoﬂice, only to have their ef-
fortsfthwarted by the Congress of,the
country when it convened, owing to
the fact that they were in sympathy
with the work that was being done
by the Diaz regime.

said:

“It is. a shame the way that‘some
Americans speak of this man as a
weaklin"g and. a coward. This man
was not a weakl-ing or a coward. How
could a man overthrow a government
of the despotic nature ,of the Diaz
regime and ‘be a coward. He accom-
plished this revolution in less than six
months. Madero is-a patriot in the
deepest sense-Of‘ the word. He is a
man that left a ﬁne home and a for-
tune to ﬁght for the betterment of
his native land. He died in the cause,
assassinated in cold blood, because he
dared to stand up against the Diaz
regirne.”

In conclusion Dr. Boyce said:

“Mexico has had her. share of
trouble, but «better things are in store
for the counitry, and the voice of peo-
ple shall have a great_power_ in the
government of the country.” ,

It. is a‘ cold blooded teacher who

FENCING AT THE UNIVERSITY

 

 

 

Although fencing has only been
taught for eight months in this Uni-
versity, it has ﬂourished beyond all
expectations. It is now recognized
as one of the minor sports, and gym-
nasium credit isgiven for attending

the fencing classes. '

A‘competition is to be held each
year to decide who shall have a :place
on the fencing team. This team was
admitted in December, 1912, into the
Intercollegiate Fencing jAssociation,
composed of teams from Cornell,
,Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Princeton,
University of Pennsylvania, and the
Naval Academy at Annapolis.

At the fencing match held a few
months ago at the Pittsburgh Ath-
letic Association, our team made a
fine showing against the team of that
club, the German Club and Cornell
University. In Februaryfour team,
totally inexperienced in college com-
petitions, made a very creditable
showing against the cadets and the
University of Pennsylvania fencers, in
t'he contest held‘ in the Naval Acad-
emy at Annapolis. _ I

The team, gets one trip each year
to Annapolis, Philadelphia ‘or some
other large city, for the collegiate pre-
liminaries, and if successful, a trip to
New York, for the ﬁnals. Besides
these contests there are a number
held inthis city in which the entire
class may -participate‘.

A gold medal was awarded for the
University championship, which was
'held laﬂt rnonth,.and there have been
many friendly meets betweeii our

. fencers, the P. A. A. and the German

Club. .- - ~

More thought has been devoted to
sword play than to any other form of
For several generations
the fencing. masters of Spain, Italy
and especially France, traveled all
over the world investigating all ways
of using a sword, until the modern
method of fencing was perfected.
These men were made nobles by the
Court of France, and all teachers had
to undergo a severe course of train-
ing for a number of years before. be-

material to work with ‘every year.

this sport. Fencing is an excellent

over the Westinghouse Club team by
a score of 55 to 30 in a dual. meet
on the Wilkinsburg indoor track and
leg of a ‘handsome
trophy cup donated by H.  -Mc-
Intosh, ’93. One more victory over

‘the Westinghouse boys will give Pitt

the permanent possession" of the
trophy. , '

Pitt athletes annexed eight ﬁrsts,’

four seconds and three thirds, while
the opponents won two’ ﬁrsts, ﬁve sec-
onds and ﬁve thirds. McD-onald,
Shoff, Marshall, Thomas, Scott and
McKinney won ﬁrst placesgin their
events. Reider and-Rappriclh won the
high jump and two-mile run for V\/‘est-

Track Men

The moderately clear weather of

 

the past few days has brought out

many new and allthe ‘old track can-
didates and from the present outlook
Pitt will have one‘ of the. best teams
of her history-this ‘year. Everyqafter-.
noon ﬁnds twenty or more men jog-
ging around the track, ‘takéng starts
or practicing at the hurdles or jumps.
. The ﬁrst meet of the season will be
held -at the Stadium on May 19th be-

tween teams representing the differ-'

ent departments of the University.
The events will be the same as are
usual to an intercollegiate meet, in-
cluding the dashes, distance runs,
hurdles, weight events and jumps.
The results should show several de-
partments Aclosely bunched, ’ as the
lV.liners. Engineers and college boys
all claim ﬁ'rst place at present, while
the professional departments are sure"
to show several “dark horses” Iiefore
the day -is over. . . ;' .

The team is fairly well developed
except for hurdlersand weight men.

Boots of_last year’s team showed con—;‘

siderable promise -at the close of the
1912 season, but he has not started
work as yet and this leaves a.big hole
in the lineup." Galvin yias the natural
strength and some ability in, the
weights. but ‘he has not done any
work so far. Shapira did good work
in prep school, but has not been out
on {the Stadium this year to throw
the! hammer or'try shot putt-ingl"
Aside from these events the team is
very strong and will make a good
showing, but if some spirit does not
come from the weight men and hurd-
lers,’ the te,am.will be beaten before
the seaso-n is- over‘.-_ f
The- ﬁght for the’ relay team will be
a‘ dandy as Pitts’ classiest perform-
ers re quarter milers. and all are
wor ing overtime to get in shape for

the crack of the pistol on the 019th. '

Capt. Rosenthal is at~last sounding
into form and should be one of the
m_en to make the Philadelphiartrip.
Matt Marshall is going strong and
shows improvement over -last year,
when he ran a very good quarter.
VVallace Thomas, the Pittsburgh
High star, is running in good form
and will do.-better than 52in the trials.
Red McDonald. Shoff, Haslett, Mc-
Kinney and Daugherty all-believe
they will make good on the relay
team, 'so sporting followers will see a
classy race when these men get to-
gether withthe relav honors as a
goal. ' -
Hazlett. by the’ way, is apt to be
the dark horse of the bunch, as he is
running» strong at present. and will
make them all hustle at the ﬁnish.
His diminutive size puts him at con-
siderable disadvantage but he makes
up for this in nerve and hard work.

Walter Camp, .in selecting him for one
of the 1911 All-American guard posi-
tions, had this to say: “Duff Of Prince-
ton was. together with Hart, one of
Orange and
Black’s excellent defensive‘ line; ag-
gressive. but not too eager, he gener-
ally located the ball with -precision and
.was -a very serious obstacle in the at-
tack of the opponents. ‘He was also

quick in breaking through.-”_ '
This was the year that Princeton

A vanquished Harvard, 8-6, and Yale, 6%,

and went throiughthe entire season
without experiencing defeat.'Although
Duff won fame as a guard,*he played
every‘ position’ except ’quarte.rback
during ‘his four years athletic ,career
at Princeton. He is, therefore. ad-
mirably well ﬁtted to coach the local
_ team and work with the new material
which will be at his disposal.
Duff -is a son of the Rev. Joseph M.
Duff, ’73, pastcir of the First Presby-
terian Church, of Carnegie, Pa.. one
of the oldest living alumni of the local
university. H-e prepared for college at
Carnegie High School and Shadyside

tin in 1912. Last fall hereturned to
‘his alma mater as assistant coachand

Tiger athletic authorities ‘desired him
to return next September. The local
offer looked better.e,hOwever, and he

T The Perfect Tobacco for Pipeand Cigarette

- Tuxedo is in a class by-itself. It has many imi-
tators—but in the pipe it has no -equal. It is made ‘
of the best selected Burley tobacco, the ﬁnest that
Kentucky grows, ripened, cured and aged until it
has reached the tip"-top of mildness, mellowness
and sweetness. Then it istreated by the Original
“Tuxedo Process” which takes out all the sting so
it cannot possibly hite—-even if you should smoke it

all day long.

You simply cannot buy better tobacco any-
where". Try Tuxedo today. You will see ‘why
these men are so fond of it.
