C. P. Snow Urges More Help

For Underdeveloped Countries

By NANCY DELANEY

The new generation, “more sensitive, more sensible, more fully human,” can provide

the force to banish the “ghastly gulf” between the rich and the poor countries, asserted
Sir Charles Percy Snow before an audience of about 3700 at Thursday’s Honors Convocation
Snow was invited here by the University for the honors convocation, which honored

over 700 students, for a grade achievement of 3.25 or over. Snow is a Cambridge scholar
with a Ph.D. in physics and chemistry. - 4

Two-thirds of the world,
in Asia, Africa, and Latin Amer-
ica, is in a situation that “we
cannot "contemplate without a
feeling" of profound guilt,” ex-
plained the British scientist,
author and civil servant. “Our
surplus will have to go to them,”
he indicated.

Their plight parallels that
which existed all over the world,
particularly in the western
countries, 200 to 300 years ago.

. How the lucky countries man-
aged to pull out of this “animal-
ly miserable existence” no one
knows; but, being among the
lucky, “we cannot contract out
of the passionate concern of our
time.”

Nor will we help merely
as a matter of good business,
although it is\'go0d business, but
rather because we see and are
aware of the unnecessary suffer-
ing. This is due partly to mod-
ern communication, but also to
the fact ‘that people today are
less hard-hearted than their an-
cestors. “We just cannot accept
that two-thirds of our brother
men‘are living miserable lives
that we can help.”

In the United States, seven per cent of the population can grow ﬁve times as much food as is
needed here, and 30 per cent can manufacture all the necessary goods.‘ Yet unless something is done,
the poor countries will get relatively poorer while the rich ones get richer. The western countries will
have to use their surplus to help these poorer ones, particularly in accumulating capital.

Snow closed by -posing to his audience the rabbinical question, “lfll am not for myself, who
am I: if I am for myself alone, what am I? It not now, when?” _

Following the address, Chancellor Litchﬁeld conferred upon Snow the honorary degree of Doctor

‘Elizabethan M iscellany ’ Long But E n joywble

By STAN SCHWEIGER and LARRY BERNFELD

A major highlight to Shakespeare Week was Thursday’s S.U.
Board P.M. Series’ marvelous evening of readings and music by The
University Theatre and The Antiqua Players. On the Stephen Foster
stage, a group of 18 individuals under the skilled direction of Miss
Glorianne Engel and the music direction of Colin Sterne, combined to
make “An Elizabethan Miscellany” enjoyable despite the inordinate
length of the program.

In a little over two and a half hours, these performers pre-
sented a survey of the Elizabethan world, its creativity and critics.
The world of William Shakespeare dominated, of course, as_ the
Bard’s ideas about love, man’s occupation, the theatre, villainy, -.
kingship, and other subjects were acted out with style, ﬂair, power, I
and meaning. Interspersed with the works of Shakespeare were writ-
ings of his contemporaries such as Thomas Nashe and John Dowland,
in literature and music, respectively. '

As Shakespeare dominated the literary scene, so did Dowland,
the musical. His characteristic madrigals were highlighted by the
melodious trio of recorders, the forerunners of today's woodwind
section. Colin and Roberta Sterne and Helen Shifrin Reps doubled
on the viols and virginals, with Miss Reps singing a powerful
contralto.' “Dear, if you change” and “Come again” highlighted her
clear tones and excellent projection.

Of the many reading highlights, those provoking particular aud-

Henshaw in a. scene from “Othello,” Larry Heller's sophosticated I.
scene from “Much Ado,” and the raucous Falstaff scene between Bill
Kingsley and Richard Tobias, and Rip Peyreux’s moving soliloqy
from “King Henry VI, Part III.”

St. Patricks Parade
Highlights First Day
Of Engineers’ Week

Today’s parade led by St. Patrick down Bigelow Boulevard will

kick off Engineering Week activities. The theme for the week, “Engi-
neering in the Future,” will be incorporated in the parade and in
displays set up in Engineering and Pennsylvania Halls.

The electrical engineering students’ display, a computor built to
play, tic-tac—toe, will be on vie_w in‘ the auditorium and in G3 of
Pennsylvania Hall. The Civil Engineering project, tackling the prob-
lems of constructing a lunar base, will be displayed in 104 and 1053
Engineering Hall. '

Also in Engineering Hall, rooms 505 and 506, will be the industrial
engineering project presenting a computer solution to a school bus
routing system. In State Hall, rooms 202 and 204, the petroleum.
engineers have set up a display illustrating secondary methods of oil
production, and on the ground ﬂoor the metallurgical engineers are
exhibiting the formation of new metals. Mechanical engineers are ex-.
ploring future applications of several ﬁelds of study in 209 and 212
Engineering Hall. The puriﬁcation of water is the chemical engiw.
nering display in the department’s building across from Veterans’
Hospital. ' . ‘

The displays will be open to all interested persons tonight
from 7 to 9:30 p.m. and tomorrow night from 8:30 to 10 p.m.
Each one will start on the half-hour. According to David Poscich.
chairman of the Engineers’ Week steering committee, engineering
students from the regional campuses are coming to View the
projects. ‘

An alumni dinner at the University Club is on the agenda for
Wednesday. Dr. William 0. Baker, vice president of research for
Bell Telephone Laboratories, will be keynote speaker. Cost of the
dinner is $5.50 for alumni and $2.50 for students.

A Thursday morning seminar at 11 a.m. is patterned on the
television program College Bowl. “The Gimmick,” a tug-of-war pit-'
ting departments against each other, will follow at noon in front of
the Student Union. The winner of the “Gimmick” receives points to-.
ward the Shamrock Award, and the losers, a thorough soaking with
a water hose.

The Shamrock Award, in the form of a plaque, is presented to
the department accumulating the highest number of points at the
week’s end. Points are awarded for: displays, working labs, Sham-
rock Ball attendance, parade arrival, seminar, mixer dance attendance,
freshman and sophomore participation at dances, “The Gimmick," and.
St. Patricia contest. _

The Shamrock Award is kept by the winning department for =
one year. Itewill be presented at Samrock Ball Saturday night, ’
marking the close of the week’s festivities. Beginning at 8:30 p.m., \
the ball will be held at the Penn Sheraton Hotel. ‘!

And AiGood Time Was Had By All

‘Greek Week One Of The Best’--Enwright

Five-Day Affair Climaxed

By Concert, Formal Dance

The highlight of the year for the Uni-
Versity’s social fraternities and sororities was
summed up well by fraternity advisor Parker
Enwright: “Overall, Greek Week was one of the
best weekends I’ve ever been through in my
somewhat more than ten years in working
with fraternities.”

It is probable that many of the 25 attend-
ing Greek organizations felt the same way.
Comments ranged from the superlatives of
“great” and “perfect,” to the less emphatic, but
still happy, “fine” and “good.”

The ﬁve-day affair began March 3 with a
Greek Sing at Soldiers Hall. Nineteen fraterni-
ties and sororities participated with five sorority
ﬁnalists vying for Greek Week Queen.

The ﬁnalists, Dana Prussin, Bobbie Lieber-
man, Beverly Lichter, Liana Vaira, and Dyanne
Hochman each gave their own rendition of a
song or dance number. The judges then voted
on the candidate they felt combined the quali-
ties of personality and theatrical performance
and chose Dianne Hochman as Greek Week
Queen.

Miss Hochman, completely overjoyed and
surprised, exclaimed: “ I just couldn’t believe
it. When they called my name I thought they
were just announcing the candidates again, but everyone kept pushing me and saying ‘you won,
you won.’ I was in a state of shock.”

At the Sing’s conclusion Mark Bebko, past IFC president, was presented‘ the Mr..Inter—fra-
ternity award by newly-elected president Norman Himes. Bebko became the ﬁrst reciplent Of the
award which will hereafter be presented annually.

After classes Wednesday, 2:30 Greeks met in Stadium Gym where a_ Fun Night was staged.
Across the gym ﬂoor people hopped in sacks while others sailed_ -on “trucks,” used to cart

..   freight but turned into a makeshift scooter,
with the fraternity member pushing and his
date riding as baggage. The ﬁnal event was an-

nounced as the surprise of the night, and “it
really caused a commotion.” The event? Pass-
ing, the orange, where shy guys had a ready-
made excuse to “neck” with their dates and
wolves were kept somewhat at bay by the in-
centive of winning, lost though it was, some-
times, with the transferring of the orange. Delta
Tau Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta shared the
honor of champions.

Open house prevailed Thursday night

for all fraternities at Party Hopping hosted by
Delta Sigma Phi, Pi Lambda Phi, and Sigma
Alpha Mu. Jazz groups and combos provided
the music and the Delta Sigs reported that
-their band, the Vibrators, presented a “wild”
performance. ' '.
‘M _ ' ' The Four Preps played to, what Jack
DR'NK'NG MADE "mm me”.y_ Zemil called a “packed” house at Carnegie
Music Hall on Friday night as Greek Week
moved into its fourth day. From the reactions, the Greeks seemed to have Saved. the hest part
for last. Enwright said: The Four Preps were one of the most successful concerts ever seen at
Greek Week)’ Beverly Reifman added: “The Four Preps were what college kids wanted to hear.
They were great.” _
The program lasted over two hours, dominated mostly by the Preps and occassionally inter-
spersed with selections of a trio that played in the background When the Preps Were in the fore-
After the concert, a dance was held in the SU b3111"00m-

With no classes Saturday, the ﬁnale of
the Week began with a noon luncheon in the
Faculty Club of the Cathedral. Dr. Sheppard
Whitman, director of the oﬂice of cultural and
educational exchange, spoke to the Greeks on
the importance of American hospitality to for-
eign students. He stressed American student’s
ignorance of the customs and even the loca-
tion of many foreign countries, and more

- alarmingly, the lack of knowledge of the United‘
States.

The climax of “the week proved to be a
ﬁtting one. At a formal dance at the Church-
ill Valley County Club, -students waltzed or gam-
bled as they chose. A Monte Carlo contest,
where fraternities and sororities tried to win
the most money, resulted in Sigma Alpha Mu
and Kappa Kappa Gamma coming in ﬁrst in
their respective divisions.

Greek Sing trophies were also awarded.
Kappa Alpha Theta ﬁnished first with “Whis-
tling Gypsy”; Phi Sigma Sigma second for
“Granada,” and Chi Omega third for “Loch
Lomond.”

The fraternities placed Pi Lambda Phi
ﬁrst. with “Waltzing Matilde”; Sigma Alpha Mu
second with “Volga Boatman” and Alpha Phi
Alpha thrid for “Man is Smart But Women is
Smarter.” Athletic trophies were also presented.

Enwright summed up the dance by call-
ing it the “most pleasant, polished, and order-
ly large-college dance I have ever attended.”

He concluded, “I join the Pitt News in hoping
. ._ it becomes a..'.tradit_ion."._ _. . I« ~_ ‘

tlitorial: To Honor The   Wort!) y  

_— ‘Sir Charles Percy Snow came to speak at the University last Thursday morning
ffand the ‘University turned out in force to greet him. It was a magniﬁcient display
"of respect and admiration for a man of his stature and although his speech did not, to a
great extent, meet the expectations which so many had hopes for, it nevertheless gave
‘Ito-all those who had the opportunity to hear it an insight into the deep respect for
humanity and faith in the future of man which the author holds sacred.

In this respect, his visit to the University achieved one of his main purposes in
coming. Not only was he here to deliver a speech but also to be‘ honored. His speech
showed that here was a man worthy of honor, and even Dr. Peake’s eloquent reading
..of Snow’s achievements in literature, education, science, and social service could only
be icing on the cake. \ - i

p 9 _ His visit was a signiﬁcant event in the history of’ the University, and we are
_‘very pleased that so many members of this institution were able and-willing to partici-
pate in the Convocation. '

diioriel: Gama’ wrangle

Well, we’re rather glad to see that Captain Ray,.head of the University police, -isn’t
going through with his plan to close off the quadrangle to all cars during the Friday
. and Saturday night rush hours. He stat ed that it was only an idea which he suggest-
ed in order to test student reaction, and that he has -no intention of doing anything
positive concerning the plan until next term at the earliest. He added, however, that
{he still considers closing the quad a good idea. i ,_ . , j

",4 " ‘ Well, if he was really just testing student reaction and if student desires are to
‘be given any consideration in this matter, then he should give up the idea altogether
'until__ the University has provided adequate facilities for students comingto pick up
-_ their dates over the weekend. ' A

Considering the facilities presently available in Oakland, it. is extremely fortunate
for the students that there is a quad where they can park their cars, and the consid-
erable amount of .student protest to Ray’s plan simply shows that students are more
»-aware of the Oakland parking problem than is the University police department.

If nothing else, the reaction to the plan should cause Captain Ray to begin con-
sidering the other consequences of a closed quad besides simply eliminating an admit-
"ted bottleneck. , ’ « »

I

A Lodge Hodge.-Poclge

_ ‘Henry Cabot Lodge’s. victory in the New
Hampshire Primary is signiﬁcant for a number
of reasons. The ‘main reason for this primary’s
importance is that it indicates, 1 think, two
3 signiﬁcant facts about the 1964 campaign for the
Presidency an_d American party politics in gen-

election to pull voters from the other side of the
fence and supplement their rolls.

To attract Democrats or uncommitted voters
to their camp, the Republicans have a choice of
policies they can appeal on the basis of per-
sonality, programs, or principles. Reversing this
order, it is clear that the Republican Party has
created a strong image of ,“fruga1ity, toughness
with the Communists, and committment to free
enterprise.” There is not spacehere to question
the congruence of image and truth; in any event,
the image created is generally held, even by the
opposition. Perception of reality in politics is as
actual as reality itself. Thus, the Party can and ’
does appeal on the basis of principles, or their
“image.”

On the basis of programs, the Party‘ has
not offered any major innovations since the
days of T.R. Its actual role, and this is in
agreement with its principles, is that of a re-
tardent to extreme,’ or allegedly extreme,
legislation and policies put forward by Demo-
cratic administrations. In terms of concrete,
speciﬁc programs designed to capture the
urban vote or. low-income vote, such as medi-
care or social security, the Republican Party
-— as a party — has had nothing to offer.

In the end, the Party must turn to person-
alities to capture the Presidency, unless it can
offer a decisive difference on principles to the
current Democratic administration. Dwight
Eisenhower ﬁt, the bill; but there are few na— -
tional heroes around with Ike’s attractiveness. In
fact, there is not a single personality capable of
drawing Eisenhower’s support in either party.

The sterility of the Republicans cause is
further demonstrated by their lack of the
“principles” argument. Johnson has stolen the
wind of Republican sails by cutting the budget
request, emphasizing frugality, and adding the
bonus of a’ tax cut. With no arguments of per-
sonality, principles, or programs, the Republican _
Party had might as well forget about 1964. The
only chance is a sudden crisis which Johnson
would not be able to handle except to his dis-
advantage. But this is strictly hypothetical.

Fate has turned a potentially vigorous" ‘G4
campaign into a dull one. Barring the disad-

eral. _
The first fact is that since the assassination of

‘Ijresident Kennedy the.nation’s politics have
been characterized by moderation —— both in
/words and deeds. President Johnson has skill-
fully re-inforced this mood consciously, by re-
ducing his budget and his public appearances, ‘
“and unconsciously, through his very manner and
speech. One can sense a slower pace; a relaxa-
tion of both the energy and dynamism of the
Kennedy administration. Gabriel Almond, poli-
tical scientist at Princeton, has claimed that the
swings in American public opinion have tended,
"during the last ﬁve years, to become less ex-
treme; i.e., public response to important issues
‘ has sought the middle ground, the moderate
course. Certainly this claim is now being demon-
»strated by the Johnson Administration.

The ‘New Hampshire Primary last Tuesday

7 ,_ was further evidence of this mood of modera-
tion. Barry’Goldwater failed to draw the sup-
port many had anticipated he would, includ-
ing the Senator himself; it is probably true
that Goldwater's own “goofs” as he terms them
in the primary campaign hurt his chances,
but these campaign mistakes would not have
been so detrimental if there had been a dra-
matic and emotionalupsurge for his election,
‘J  which there wasn’t. It is going to be hard for
Senator Goldwater to arouse people who are
tired’ or afraid of being aroused.

- The second fact, revealed partly by the first,
is that the Repub1ican~Party is faced with a
‘ serious lack of ammunition to ﬁght the mood
. of moderation. The Republican Party since
“Teddy Roosevelt’s day has lacked a program of
“social legislation. The party has identified itself

, Men Nof Consulted   
  In Orientation Plans

Editor, The Pitt News: A
As many people are aware,
a committee, in conjunction.
with Men’s" Council and the
Dean ‘of Men’s Office, has
been meeting in an effort’ to
"improve, the men’s freshmen
orientation program at the
‘ University. , A
After much deliberation
and debate, and the tabula-
_ tion of the results of a ques-
tionnaire, a plan were sub-
mitted to the -University
Orientation Committee
through a representative of
the Dean of Men’s staff.
Without ‘consultation with
the students, the plan, which
had taken months to formu-
late, was hastily rejected by
the Orientation Committee.
One major tenet of the
students’ proposal would
provide for an increase in
contact between upper-
class students ‘and male
freshmen during the sum-
mer orientation sessions.
What is wrong with this?
Nothing, except that the
philosophy of the Dean of
Women’s Office differs.
The Dean of Women’s Of- .
ﬁce maintains that stu-

should be made in the fall.
A valid, point,_ butisn’t this
point also valid — that the‘
time for student-to-student

And what was the reason for
the rejection of this point?
None was given.
Furthermore, there is but

tion Committee,, a girl. who

Why weren’t the backers
of this plan invited to pre-

have been an oversight?
Or could the plans submit-

of the chairman of this
committee? .

It is again apparent that

By FRANK SMIZIK
LANCASTER,’ Pa. — Clutch per-
formances by Lehigh wrestlers en-
abled them to edge the Panthers,
58-57, for the Eastern Intercollegiate
Wrestling Championships here this week-
end.
The Panthers had one consolation, how-
ever, Mike Johnson won the 130-pound
' championship which eluded him last year
and was picked as the outstanding wrest-
ler of the tournament by the coaches.
Pitt was leading, 57-55, going into the
last four matches and had two men ‘left
to wrestle. But neither Lee Hall or Ken
Barr could manage victories, while John
Gladish of Lehigh won his key match at
191-pounds over Steve Speers of Temple,
and gave Lehigh the victory. .
Hall met Penn State’s Marty Strayer

=1'a::e«.cr.-“.;.. 17m-:‘rn"r NEWS é   ll =Mar-‘oh 16. 1954 A

  Wrestlers L03pAEastern Crown By One Point

in his ﬁnal match and could do nothing
at all. Strayer tied him up and rode him
the whole match, beating him, 3-0.

In Barr’s match Gerry Franzen of
Navy proved too much and Barr-had to

ﬁght to stop from getting pinned. The-

score tells the whole story of the match
as Franzen won, 15-1. Barr lost to Fran-
zen last year in overtime at the Easterns,
but beat him in the National Champion-

ships for ﬁfth place. 2

Johnson’s match wasn’t high scoring,
6-2, because he couldn’t catch Lehigh’s
Bill Stuartto wrestle him. Stuart stayed
away the ‘whole ﬁrst period and was
warned for stalling.

After Stuart’s warning in the ﬁrst per-
iod Johnson was awarded a point in the
second period for Stuart’s stalling. John-
son had two takedowns and two escapes
while Stuart got his two points for two

escapes. Johnson also pinned Sam Pier-

son of Princeton, at 2:13, beat Dale Lucas «

of Navy, 9-1, and topped. Ted Lansky of
Penn, 5-1, enroute to his 130-pound
championship and outstandingﬂwrestler
award. _

Other Pitt wrestlers who fared well
were Dino Boni, at 147-pounds, and Tom-
Baily, at 157-pounds, who ﬁnished third
and Frank O’Korn who took a fourth at
137-pounds. Tom Heniff, who was seeded
third at 123—pounds, lost in the ﬁrst
round as did Bill Beck and Bill Bodle.

At 123-pounds the individual champ
was Jay Winfelder of Penn State who
defeated Warren Crow of Cornell, 9-8.
Earlier this season in dual matches Win-
felder was tie_d by Heniﬂ and Crow was
heat by Duff Killian.

Wayne Hicks of Navy was the winner

at 137-pounds. -He » decisioned Mark
Scureman, of Army, 5-2. O’Korn, who

was seeded fourth had to meet under top-

seeded Hicks in the semi-ﬁnals and was
beaten, 8-4.

Doug Koch of Lehigh beat George Ed-
wards of Penn State, 4-3, in overtime for
the 147-pound title. Koch was also ﬁrst
seeded and Dino Boni had to meet him
in the semi-ﬁnals. Dick Slutzky, Syra-
cuse, whipped Harley Ferguson of Lehigh,
6-2, for the ‘.57’-pound title.

Jim Nance, defending his Eastern title

had his toughest match, but still beat Ed.

Scharer of Rutgers, 6-4. Scharer, how-
ever, had still managed to score the high-
est point total over a three year period
of any wrestler, 36, and was voted the
Fletcher Memorial Award. Barr was
second with 32.

     

Leh igh Deserves
Eastern Title  

LANCASTER, Pa. — Rex Peery was motionless and
emotionless as he watched Lehigh’s John Gladish battle
Temple’s Steve Speers in the ﬁnals of the Eastern 191-pound
championship. Peery may have looked that W: y, but; he
didn’t feel that way. -

He couldn’t have because Gladish was beatizcg Speers

four years and knocking Pitt out of the
running for the. championship which
ronly and hour earlier seemed certain
to be theirs.

Gladish’s win gave Lehigh three
points and pushed them past the Pan-
thers, 58-57. The Lehigh fans went
wild. They had been counting off the
seconds and when they reached zero
the Franklin and Marshall College
Gym was pandemorium. Gladish was
more popluar with the people‘ of
Lehigh than Bill Mazeroski was with
« Pittsburghers in October of 1960. '

303 SMIZIK Lehigh coach Gerry Leeman was
as jubialant as Lehigh fans were as he pounded Gladish on
the back and walked him to the dressing room.

Lost Two Dual Meets

Helhad a right to feel the way he did. Like just.about

every other team in the East Lehigh started the season with
very little. They lost two dual meets and were almost beaten
by little Bloomsburg State last week. But Leeman had his

w forces primed for the tournament and they came through

‘like no one had any right to expect.

Harley Ferguson, a mediocore 157-pounder,‘ took a second

in that weight class. A wrestler the caliber of Ferguson would
have been eliminated in the ﬁrst round in past years, but

 

the most of it. .-

But it was more than wrestlers like Ferguson coming
through which gave Lehigh the championship. It. was just a
pltaliin show of guts by Lehigh wrestlers which gave them the

1 e. . .

A Pitt led Lehigh by five points after Mike Johnson won
the 130-pound title. Lehigh had three men left and the Pan-
thers two at that point. In _order to win the Engineers had
to win two of their three and the Panthers needed to drop

- both of theirs. That’s exactly what happened.

Koch Wins Title
Lehigh’s 147-pounder Doug Koch beat George Edwards

guson was beaten at 157-pounds to narrow the Engineers’
chances. The Panthers could have clinched the meet at 167
and'177-pounds’, but both Lee. Hall and Ken Barr faltered.
Hall was rendered useless by Penn State’s Marty Strayer,
v as Strayer used a leg ride to tie up Hall most of the match.
_ Barr just didn’t have the stamina to wrestle four matches
in two days as he was helpless against Navy’s Gerry Franzen
« : and lost, 15-1. The Panthers still could have won, but Gladish
‘ _ was too good for top-seeded Speers and Lehigh had the
tournament.

Lehigh’s three wins in the last four years rates as the '

most powerful grip any team has had on Eastern honors
since Pitt won from 1954-56. Lehigh, claims it has its best
. freshman team win -its history, so it may be a long time before
«the Panthers win Easterns honors again. ‘ -= v 

uv

 

 

and in the process giving Lehigh their third Eastern title in '

this year the 157-pound classwas weak and Ferguson made '

to bring the Engineers within two points of the leaders. Fer- -

Panthers Fail in First NIT Attempt

""9 C gersLose to Drake, 87 -82; I

Generalovich   Scores 30 Points  

By ART FLEISCHNER

NEW YORK — Drake’s 87-82 win over the
Panther basketball team ‘Saturday afternoon was
a typical game for Pitt. ‘Each of the players re- -
-vealed the form that he has shown this year.

{Brian Generalovich played a great game"

when the team needed him the most. Paul V

Krieger fouled out. Cal Sheﬂield controlled the
ball about 60
per cent of~
the time the
Panthers had
it. ' Dave Sauer
p e r f o r m-
ed poorly on
the road. And
the team hit
their season
average in a
ﬁne shooting
display.

As was the
case in the
Los Angeles
Classic and
all the tough
games Pitt
had this year,
and the last
three years,
the General
made his
nickname sig-
niﬁcant. He
c 0 n t i n -»
ually drove,
drew fouls,
r e‘ b o u n d-
ed and led
, the team.

His play
drew the
plaudits of
11,000 ‘fans
at Madison.
Square Gar-
den. Every-
one praised
him, but
h i m s e 1 I.
“We should
. have won
that game today," he said. “Heck, they only
had three good ballplayers. I thought we
would win going into the game and I
thought so at halftime.

     

GENEIKALOH '

“That guy McLemore was the best jumper I

ever played against. As‘ iar as I can remember
he’s the only one who ever blocked my fade
away jump shot.”

Krieger got into foul trouble again and had
to sit out most of the game. Bob Lovett, his re-
placement, played well. Lovett only scored
four points, but had six rebounds to be secon
on the club to Genera1ovich’s 11. ‘ -

Sauer again" played benw par away from
--He had th  ~ ~

 

    
 
 

stopping McLemore, but couldn’t do it as Mc-

Lemore had 17 points off him in the ﬁrst half.

Considering what Generalovich said about
him and how the ‘New York writers praised him,’
McLemore played agreat game. This year he
led the Missouri Valley Conference in Febound.
ing and last year he tied for the lead".

“McLemore was all-MVC this; year,”. said
Drake ‘coach Maurice John. “I haven’t seen too
many college ballplayers that can‘ jump like he

can. I think he will play professional ball if he‘
gets drafted." ' 1 A

In the second half, McLemore only scored
three points and those in the last two minutes. I '
Most of the credit for that performance goes
to Daryle Ruby, who guarded McLemore the
majority of the time. I

In the ﬁrst half,.Cal Shelﬁeld scored 17 points
and had the Garden fans yelling for more. Shef.
ﬁeld tried togive it to them in the second half,

I but instead he gave it to Drake. He was as cold

in the second half as he was hot in the ﬁrst half.

'As has been the case all year, Sheffield con-
trolled the ball for over half the game. He still
regards passes as something you give to your
family. His solo tactics in the second half hurt
the Panthers as much as he helped them in the‘
ﬁrst half.

Panther coach Bob Timmons said, “I know

Cal handled the ball a lot, but we like to -have '

him_or Generalovich with the ball as much as
possible. Cal usually hits those shots that ’,he
was missing in the second half.”

Sam Marando, assistant New Mexico coach
who was scouting both teams for tomorrow's‘
game said, “The team should have given the
ball to Generalovich more and let him drive.
I don’t think Drake could stop him one on
one." Most of the players did use Marando’s
advice. 1 .

In a reversal of form, Dave Roman let his
defensive work. outshine his offensive play.
Roman guarded‘ the Bulldogs’ ‘Bill Foster and
limited him ‘to six points. Foster had been
averaging 14 a game and "was the key player on
the Drake team according to Coach John.

Larry Szykowny, who played about half the
game, scored ten points and almost sparked the
Panthers to an upset. He_ came off the bench
and stole two passes in a row to get Pitt back
in the game. Neither of the men he was cover-
ing scored any points.

As sophomores, both he and Lovett per-
formed admirably. At times they showed more
poise than some of the seniors. Each drew praise
from John. “Those two sophomores played well
for Pitt,” ‘said John, “but that Generalovich is
one of the best I've seen all year." -

The loss gives the Panthers a 17-8 record
for the season. Sheﬂ‘ield’s 24 points gives him a
career total of 1115, to become the fourth-high.
est, scorer in. Pitt history. Sheﬂield ended his

career with, one more point than Generalovich,

By BILL CABIN

Despite a fourth quarter surge by
Delta Sigma Phi, Bruno’s Boys maintained
their lead last Thursday to cop the Intra-
mural basketball championship with a 31-
29 victory, at Fitzgerald Field House. The
Delta Sigs, who played with,Barry Wetzel,
were hampered throughout the game by the
B-runo’s tight man-to—man defense.

The Brunos scored 24 points in the ﬁrst half
while holding Delta Sig to seven points. Brunos
applied a tight man—to—man defense which‘ the
Delta Sigs were unable,to penetrate from the
outside or inside. John Pignetti, Delta Sig’s top
scorer, was held to four points as he hit 2 baskets
in 14 attempts. *

Neither Ralph Cappy nor Andy Alex were
able to pick.up the slack for Delta Sig as they
scored a- combined total of one point and got
ﬁve fouls in the first half. ' '

Fouls provedwto be the downfall of Delta
Sig. ‘Cappy had four fouls in the ﬁrst half
and only played a few minutes of the second
half. Barry McKnight and Alex, also had four
and three fouls, respectively, which hampered
them in the second half.

Delta Sig,‘ however, dominated the second
half by outscoring the Brunos, 22-7. But despite
their inability to score, Bruno’s Boys stayed cool
and won the game by maintaining their defense
and outrebounding Delta Sig in the last two
minutes. , '

LOOSE BALL — Two Delta Sigma Phi players
V (without shirts), Bob Gaffney (left) and Barry
V McKnight,‘ go after the ball in Wednesday’s<IM
 K basketball ' championship .won by, Bruno’s Boys.

The Brunos earned their berth in the ﬁnals
by edging Winbrook in the semi-ﬁnals last Tues-
day, 27-25, in a double overtime game. They
played thatgame without Bill Howley and Jim
Dodaro, both of whom are starters.

Bruno’s Boys defensive ability was also a
standout in the semi-ﬁnal game as they blocked
several Winbrook shots. Their offense was led
by Mitch Zalnasky with 13 points and Phil Da-
har, who had 8. Fred Hoaglin was high man for
Winbrook with 11 points.

In the second overtime, Hoaglin missed a .

jump shot and a teammate missed the follow-

up shot. Bruno’s Boys got the second rebound

and Balnasky tipped in a Kenny Lucas shot

for the winning basket.

Delta Sig had an equally hard battle to get
into the championship as they edged the Ma_jor

Connectors, 53-49. They were down, 21-17, at’

half time but again, as in the ﬁnals, Delta Sig
outscored its opponent in the second half.

' John Pignetti led the comeback with 12 points
in the second half, and Barry Wetzel scored 9.
Both Wetzel and Andy Alex played a key role
in the victory as they dominated the rebounding
‘throughout the game.

The Major Connectors, which had four start- _
ers averaging in double iﬁgures, were led by ’

Miles Ranck, who had 21 points. Byron Justus
and Gus Oakley, who had averaged 35 points a
game between them, only had a total of 19
points.

Band Livens Half-Time

During the 1962-63 basketball
season Panther rooters were in-
troduced to an innovation in half-
time entertainment. -The newly-
tormed Panther Band became the
center of a lively half-time show.

Membership is derived largely
from the Varsity Marching Band
personnel. The bandsmen describe
themselves as a “semi-dance” or-
ganization. Aside from their half-
time duties, these musicians also
perform at the Annual Letter-
men’s Dinner, and at the All-
Sports Banquet.

Provides Entertainment

The band was formed with two
purposes in mind. First, to in-
crease spirit at home basketball
games, but at the same time to
provide entertainment for the
fans, and the bandsmen them-
selves.

The Panther Band, as part of
