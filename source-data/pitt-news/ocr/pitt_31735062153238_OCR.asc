ALUMNI EDITOR ‘seeks
A OLD PICTURES

The Alumni editorris still on the
hunt for old pictures of the athletic,
dramatic, musical and other organiza-
tions which ﬁourished in “the good
old days” at the Univgrsity. During
this year pictures have been published
of a number of the athletic teams and
they have always attracted a lot of
comment. Let us have some more of
them. Class pictures are also very
acceptable. Those sending them
should furnish a key of names so The
Weekly readers will have the oppor-

tunity to consider the “Before” and

“After.” We would like to have a

picture for each issue of The Weekly

in April, as space is plentiful during
that time. The pictures will -be re-
turned gain just as good shape as re-
ceived and will not be disﬁgured in
any way. '

Call up the Alumni office if you are

we will send for ‘them. They will be
returned as soon as we have had a
cut made of them.

JIMMY IIEHAIIT NIIW    
IN snuu WIIHPIIIATES

“Jimmy”.Dehart, EX. ’20, Pitt’s ster-
ling athlete of a few years ago, is
now in the Sunny south with the Pitts-
burgh baseball team and newspaper
reports from Hot Springs, Va., where
the Pirates are located, are remarking
about his snappy work. There are
many recruits trying out with the
Pirates who have had a lot more ex-
periencethdn “Jimmy,” but the clever
Panther athlete will undoubtedly make

them all step to displace him. He is
a candidate for third base, a. position
he played on the Pitt varsity team.
Before leaving with the Pirates, De-
hart was in the alumni office a.nd said
he was going South,witl1 the idea of
showing all he, had. He had abso-
lutely nothing to /lose by the move
and if he made good he was the gain-
er. He had just returned from Hayti,
where he and some friends were
looking over conditions in the Black
Republic. In the Fall, regardless of
whether he makes goodin baseball or
not, Dehart will take up the football
coaching reins at the University of
Georgia, where he made a fine record
last season. With,.,..;games with Har-

lege rivals, “Jimmy” has some hard
work cut out for hgim there. ,
Pittites will watch the training
ground reports concerning the Pirates
very eagerly for the next few weeks
to see how “Jimmy” is coming out
in his venture. And if he succeeds,
there are m,any.Pitt baseball fans who
will slip away from the offices and go
to Forbes Field on the warm after-
noons just to get a glimpse of him at
third base. “Jimmy” has the habit of
making good in anything he attempts
and there have been more surprising
things happen than his ﬁlling a regu-
lar berth in the Pirates’ lineup. With
his speed and throwing and hitting
ability he is sure to impress Manager

ALUMNI ARE llllﬁfll Til   .
, SUPPORT SPRING SPBRTS

The spring sport season is about

I at hand, with, basketball over, and

alumni are greatly interested in

The athletic authorities expect very
successful seasions in all these
‘branches of sport and are desirous
of getting even greater support from
the alumni. The baseball games are
to be played at Trees Field and
Forbes Field, and, it is hospedthat
the alumni will come out in larger
numlbers than ever before. The
Penn State and ‘W. & J. games are
among those to be played at Forbes
Field, there being sched-uled on
dates that the Pirates are on the
road. Baseball was put back on the
Pitt sport calendar last year, at the
urgent requent -of Pitt students and
alumni, and now that we have a
team, and what promises to be a

serving of better support than was
accorded the 1920 outﬁt. A number
of the top notch college teams of

eluding Yale, Brown, Penn State, VV.
»& J., Bucknell and others. ’ ‘
The varsity track team will ap-
pear here in the University Inter-
col-legiates, and in a. dual with West
Virginia University. Dual meets are
scheduled away with Navy, Syracuse,
Colgate and Penn State.

It is hoped to secure courts this
week for the tennis team, in which
event a representative schedule will
-be arranged. The problem of the
athletic authorities has been to lo-
cate these courts but it appears that
a place is ﬁnally'available.
