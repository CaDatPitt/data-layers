Police nab
book thief

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

A Pittsburgh man who tried to sell back
stolen books to the Pitt Book Center was
arrested by campus police last Friday.

The suspect, whose name is being held
pending investigation, resisted arrest and
assaulted campus police Ofﬁcer Francis

(:»Walsh, who was trying to arrest him.

is

According to campus police reports, the
suspect “with his right hand struck [Walsh]
in the right side of the face.” The report
also states that a struggle took place with
the suspect striking Walsh “numerous times
to the body and head.”

Walsh said he was in the bookstore

«investigating recent thefts. While Walsh

was in the store, an employee of the store
came to the manager’s office and reported
that a man was trying to return textbooks
that matched ones which were missing.

The suspect was taken up to the
managers’ office, where Walsh asked him
where he got the books. The suspect said
that he got the books from his mother.
When the suspect was asked to produce
his mother’s phone number, the suspect
said that his mother died a year ago.

Walsh said, “I informed him that the
books he had in his possession were
stolen, and I was arresting him for receiving
stolen property. I stood him up and put
him on the wall to pat him down. When I
did that, he went to go out the door and
brushed by me. I grabbed him. He turned
around and hit me in the right side of the
face.”

Walsh held the suspect down while the
bookstore manager called campus police,
who assisted in restraining and arresting
the suspect.

All three books were the same copy of
Energy Management Handbook, totalling
$298.

The suspect was charged with aggravated
assault, resisting arrest and receiving stolen
property.

Campus police are trying to make a
connection between this arrest and the
other incidents involving missing or
returned textbooks. One such incident
includes a call made last week by Tom
Sabol, owner of Your Campus Store.

Sabol was suspicious of a middle-aged
couple who has been frequently returning
brand-new textbooks with Pitt Book Center
stickers on them. Sabol contacted campus
police when the couple visited his store
three times in one day, returning a total of
13 brand—new texts. Two of the returned
texts were Digital Control of Dynamic
Systems, costing $54 each. The couple said
they were returning the texts because
their son had been called to serve in the
Persian Gulf.

Campus police have been investigating
the situation.

Sabol said that he has no way of knowing
if books being returned are stolen because
there are presently no reports of stolen
books. He must assume that the books he
buys back are legitimate.

‘No one reports stolen books. If there
are no reports of stolen books, then we

New book store offers cheap alternative

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Stat)“ Writer

Pitt students are now being
offered an alternative to the
Pitt Book Center at the
Pittsburgh Shoppe, a new store
in South Oakland which offers
used textbooks at discounted
prices.

“I'm trying to help out the
students,” said Pittsburgh
Shoppe owner Scott Sabol.
“When pricing my books, I go
by what the publisher’s retail
should be, and then I discount
them from there."

Sabol, who sells only used
books, feels that he has a

growing business on his hands.

“I’ve had tons of [students]
come in and ask me for a book
because they claimed the [Book
Center] was out of it."

Sabol claims that books on
back order are not the fault of
the Book Center. “A lot of it
involves the publisher not
getting the book out on time,”
said Sabol.

In pricing the books, Sabol
sells them at up to 32 percent
off the retail price. Aused book
priced at $21.55 at the Book
Center can be expected to run
around $18 at Sabol’s store.

Students can expect to save
the most on books that cost the

most money. For instance,
Halliday and Resnick’s
"Fundamentals of Physics",
which The Book Center sells
new for $62.95, can be
purchased from Sabol for
$42.50. Buying it used from
The Book Center would cost a
student approximately $47.50.
With the majority of Sabol’s
books being obtained from
wholesalers, he feels that the
bulk of his business will be
because there is a limited
number of used books
available at the Book Center.
Overall, the prices at the
Pittsburgh Shoppe can be
expected to be about 5 to 10

percent less than the used prices
quoted by the Book Center. A
book that runs $47 to $50 new
can be obtained at Sabol’s store
for approximately $37.

The Book Center is the

centralized location where the

great majority of student
textbooks are purchased. After
a professor chooses the text for
his/her class, the order is placed
with a publishing company by
the Book Center. The chances
are that whatever price the
publisher quotes as retail is
what the Book Center will
charge students for the new
book. ‘

Localjews torn over Scud attacks on Israel

By Jean Lewis
For The Pitt News

Four people have died and 204 have
been injured since Iraq began sending
Scud missiles to Israel.

Local Jews have mixed feelings about
the attacks and the question of whether
Israel should retaliate.

Rabbi Joseph Levine of B’nai B’rith
Hillel said that Israel has gone to great
lengths to remain neutral from the
beginning of the conflict. The conflict in
the Persian Gulf is not an Arab-Israeli
conflict, Levine said.

“I admire President Bush for not falling
prey to that whole notion that [Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein] calls linkage,‘
Levine said;

Levine refuted Saddam’s reasons for the

attack.

“Saddam Hussein didn’t go to help the
Palestinians living in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip. That was not the reason,”
Levine said.

So far the Israeli government has not
ordered a counterattack on Iraq, but it has
not ruled out that possibility.

“I think that Israel has the full right to
retaliate. Israel was not part of this war,"
Amitai Rotem, Israeli cultural emissary to
the United States, said.

Rotem still has many friends and family
members in Israel and said he was deeply
saddened by the whole incident.

Last year, Ariel Shore, a senior at the
University of Pittsburgh, spent a semester
studying at Tel Aviv University. Shore said
that as early as last May there were rumors
of a war with Iraq.

“For the Israelis, the biggest threat is
Iraq because of the military threat,” Shore
said.

Senior Carrie Bernard also spent a
semester at Tel Aviv University. After
hearing the news of the first attack, Bernard
said, “(The Israelis] have the right to
retaliate."

Bernard said that when any nation is
attacked, it should have the right to
retaliate.

Sophomore Michael Srulevich said, "I
think Israel will retaliate; I just don’t know
when.”

Marc Reiter, campus coordinator of
Masada, the youth group of the Zionist
Organization of America, said that the
attack was ‘very upsetting.’ .

‘It shows the kind of person [Saddam]
is,’ Reiter said

 

Privacy Act helps protect First Amendment

By Mark Smith
Sta_ﬂ' writer

In the computer age, data
banks, credit-card companies and
government agencies record
personal information about you
daily. Any individual with a
terminal and a link to speciﬁc
data banks can access personal
information about your life. Your
right to privacy protects you to a
certain degree.

Privacy has become a
controversial term —— one of the
most heated topics in judicial
debate.

A right to privacy is intimately
connected with most of our
constitutional freedoms.
Although not specifically
mentioned in the Constitution,
the notion of privacy emerged
from our nation's founders’ ideas
of personal autonomy and
individual liberties.

Our Bill of Rights is a flexible
document; it asserts a strong
notion of privacy. The First
Amendment guarantees free

speech and the free exercise of
religion. The Fourth Amendment
protects “persons, houses, papers
and effects” from unreasonable
searches, demands and seizures
made by government. Privacy is
also asserted in the Fourth
Amendment.

Abortion, drug testing, birth
control, sexuality and access to
personal information and

computer data banks are all topics
discussed in relation to privacy.
Question: What protections
exist against the government’s
collection of information and
invasion of privacy?
Answer: In 1974, Congress
enacted the Privacy Act as an
outgrowth of the Watergate
scandal. Unfortunately, it's a weak
law and poorly enforced.

Q: What does the Privacy Act
do?

A: The Privacy Act regulates
information collected by
government agencies and sets up
guidelines between citizens and
the ‘government. Government
agencies are to collect (“to the
greatest extent possible”) only
“necessary” information about
individuals. It allows individuals
the right to access such
information and to correct
mistakes. It restricts government
agencies from harassing
individuals exercising First
Amendment rights and prohibits
the government’s keeping files
on ways in which citizens exercise

their First Amendment rights. The
act also guarantees the right to
limit disclosure to outsiders and
the right to legal recourse to
enforce the privacy provisions.
Q: How effective is the Privacy
Act?

A: It’s not very effective.
Intelligence and law—enforcement
agencies can prevent access to
files of information. The courts
have permitted the government
great latitude when interpreting
the Privacy Act. It can be difficult
to win damages or even correct
government records.

Q: What have the courts said
about information privacy?
A: In Katz v. United States, the
Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps
without a warrant were
unconstitutional. In U.S. v. Miller,
the Court found that individuals’
bank records were not private.
This 1976 ruling marked the
Court’s departure from pro-
privacy decisions.

Q: Why does the Privacy Act
prevent government harass-

Iraqi air force strategy unclear

By Jeff Tatusko
Contributing Editor

The Iraqi air force may be
beginning to discount itself from
the war without ﬁring any shots.

Many top—of-the-line Iraqi jets
have been ﬂying into Iran for
the past several days. These jets
include many MiG 295, among
the best planes made by the
Soviet military. Gen. Tom Kelly
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said
that as many as 80 top-line Iraqi
jets have gone to Iran so far.
Kelly also said that the allies
have attempted to shoot down
these planes, but since Iraq
borders Iran, this is very hard to
do.

Iran has vowed to hold on to
any planes from either side
which violate its air space.
Should this hold true, the Iraqi
air force could basically be
surrendering its way out of the
war.

Before this conflict started,
many people in the U.S.
government feared that Iran
would side with the Iraqis
during the conflict. However, it
seems that this will not be the
case.

The two countries have been

In

|l\lTl—lE GULF

at odds for more than a decade.
They fought an eight—year war
in which more than one million
people on each side died.

After Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein attempted to garner
Iranian support. Hussein was
even willing to give back gains
that Iraq won during the war.

Iraq also pulled many troops
off the Iranian border as a sign
of compromise with the
government in Tehran. These
troops were apparently moved
into the new battle zone.

In other developments:

- Missiles launched yesterday
at Israel hit sites on the West
Bank.

Israeli officials said parts of a
Scud missile fired at Israel
rained down on the West Bank,
home of the Palestinian people.
Many of these people back
Saddam in this conﬂict. This is
the first reported hit by a Scud
in the West Bank. If Saddam
continues to hit the West Bank
with the inaccurate Scuds, he

could lose support there. No
injuries were reported.

oThe oil slick caused by Iraqi
troops has not gotten any bi gger
in the past 24 hours. Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams said
yesterday that the slick was
reported to be 55 miles long
and 10 miles wide, the same
size it was the day before.

Apparently, allied bombing
of the region in Kuwait where
the oil was spilling from has
done its job. The allies bombed
two oil manifolds yesterday in
an attempt to shut off the oil.

-Williams confirmed
yesterday that the Iraqis are
holding seven American
prisoners of war.

He said that four of these are
from the Air Force, one from
the Navy and one is from the
Marines.

olraq said that some POWs
have been wounded during
allied attacks. Iraq said that
they were wounded in attacks
on civilian targets.

0 American sorties (missions)
total more than 25,000 since
the war began. At the Pentagon
brieﬁng yesterday, Williams
said that 2,500 sorties had been
ﬂown within the past 24 hours.

discovers new galaxy

By Lane Hornfeck
Staff Writer

University of Pittsburgh
astronomy and physics Professor
David Turnshek has discovered
what may be the farthest “normal”
galaxy ever sighted.

Turnshek, an extra-galactic
astronomer, happened on the
formation when working in Chile.
Because of Pittsburgh’s lack of
astronomical facilities to view the
southern hemisphere, Turnshek
was forced to apply for visitor-
observation time at the European
Southern Observatory in Chile.

Some of Turnshek’s
collaborators on the discovery,
Dr. F. Machetto and Dr. William
Sparks, helped him obtain time
on the ESO telescope.

One of Turnshek’s fellow
colleagues and collaborators, Dr.
Cyril Hazard, who is a Mellon
professor of astronomy and
physics at Pitt, discovered the
quasar which provided the light
for the research.

“The main intention of the
project ‘was to see how light
passes through a neutral
hydrogen cloud,” said Turnshek.
“The quasar which Cyril [Hazard]

discovered served as that light
source."

As the astronomers studied the
quasar, they found that it
fluctuated from bright to dim
when looked at through a
spectrograph. A combination of
the neutral hydrogen cloud and
the light being emitted from stars
nearby supposedly caused this.

“The purpose was to see if I
could find the stars which were
emitting that light, whether they
were near to the cloud or simply
in the space between the cloud
and the Earth,” said Turnshek.

“I didn’t find any bright stars in
the cloud of hydrogen but
happened to see another light
emission, which was dimming
just as the quasar did when

ment of individuals who
exercise First Amendment

rights?

A: The act ensures the privacy of
political belief, a First Amendment
tenet. The government has spied
on and harassed political
organizations. During the ’60s
and '70s the Federal Bureau of

Investigation spied on, infiltrated .

and harassed anti-war protesters,
‘Martin Luther King Jr., and other

civil-rights leaders. During the
'80s the FBI focused on enemies
of the Reagan administration.
Despite assurances from the FBI,
this spying probably continues to
this day. Before meetings many
political groups ask if any law-
enforcement or FBI officials are
present. Such officials should
identify themselves.

Q:_Can I obtain U.S. govem-
ment records?

A: Yes. The Freedom of

Information Act creates a stronger
right to government information
than the Privacy Act.

observed through the spectrograph." This was the galaxy that
T urnshek found.

“It is one of the more amazing discoveries in extra-galactic
astronomy in the past few years," said Turnshek. The galaxy is
a “normal” galaxy, which means that “so far there is no extra-
normal activity, and it is not a very bright star formation,”
according to Turnshek.

According to associate astronomy and physics Professor
Frank Briggs, “People have been struggling to find a new
galaxy. All that we see now are old.”

In relative terms, Turnshek estimated the galaxy to be
approximately 11 billion light years away, making it only two
billion years old.

“In terms of our universe, that would make it fairly young,”
said Turnshek. “This now gives us the opportunity to study
galaxies at a very voting age, enabling us to see what goes on
in the early stages of development.”

Briggs said, “'l'tirnshek has not only made his mark in extra-
galactic astronomy but is also well known for his Work in
refining the techniques of sighting 21 Broad Absorption Line
quasar."

Turnshek, who has been at Pitt for two—and—a-half years, has
also worked at the Space Telescope Science Institute atjohns
Hopkins University. Born in Pittsburgh, he obtained his bachelor’s

degree at Villanova University and his Ph.D. at the University of‘,

Arizona.
Pittsburgh native Matthew Bencke, a Harvard University
undergraduate, also collaborated with Turnshek on the project.

Books

Continued from page 1

In the event that too many
books were ordered or that some
of the books were sold back to
the bookstore by students, the
Book Center will provide a limited
amount of used books, usually at
25 percent off the retail price
quoted by the publishers.

Mary Bonach, director of the
university-owned and -operated
Book Center, explained the store's
policy on buying back used books
from students.

“We buy first for [the Book
Center's] needs and then for the
wholesalers’, “ she said.

The university will quote a price
on a used book, depending upon
the needs of the wholesaler at a
particular time. If there is a
demand, the Book Center will
buy a $10 book back from a
student for $5, and then resell the
book for $7.50 in the store. If the
demand is not as great or if the
edition of the book is no longer
used, students can expect to get
back much less than what they
originally paid for the book or
even nothing at all.

After the Book Center has met
its quota for used books, it will
continue to purchase from
students for various wholesalers.
Students can expect to receive
much less for their books when

this happens.

“Students will usually get more
money [for used books] at the
end of a term when a new
semester is beginning,” said
Bonach.

Sabol stated that a few
professors have contacted him
about ordering books for classes
instead of going through the Book
Center. According to Bonach,
professors must order their books
from the Book Center because of
a state tax- exemption law, which
says that if a professor fails to
order a book from a university-
owned and -operated store, he/
she must pay a tax on the books
ordered.

Although Sabol does not buy
back books, he gave some advice
on the process of buying and
selling them.

“When [students] are buying
and selling books, they must
compare and contrast prices, shop
around and get out there early
[after a semester ends], ” said Sabol.

Sabol said that it is not easy to
earn a proﬁt from the buying and
selling of books of any kind.

“Everyone has a hard time
making a living off of books,
except the publishers, who decide
the retail and inevitably make the
most money.

as General Chemistry, Physics and

according to Sabol.

Hooray for Hac/eett. ..

It is no secret that the University of Pittsburgh has had
problems recruiting the so-called “student athlete,” as
many potential athletes have allowed their grades to fall
below the required to keep a 2.0 quality-point average.
Now the university, speciﬁcally football coach Paul Hackett,
is making an attempt to keep the grades up.

Curvin Richards, a junior tailback for the football team
and the second-leading rusher in school history behind
Tony Dorsett, has been suspended indeﬁnitelyfor violating
team rules and policy. According to The Pittsburgh Press,
one of the major reasons could have been Richards’ poor
academic status and absences from mandatory study
halls.

Richards,‘ who suffered a sprained ankle during the
season last year, has continually been a star for the
Panthers. During his career, he gained 2,510 yards and
was to be a major part of the Panthers’ attack next season.

This obviously had little bearing on Hackett’s decision.
Hackett’s philosophy has been to balance academics and
athletics. With this suspension, Hackett has sent a clear
message to the rest of the team: Keep the grades up, or
take time off to do so.

Although this may seem to be an original idea from the
coach of a big-time college power, this is not the first time
that Hackett has done this. Richards was suspended from
the West Virginia game last season because he missed a
study session.

Hackett has also suspended many other players for
various reasons. Only 10 of 22 starters on last year's squad
went without some type of suspension for disciplinary
actions.

Hackett said that Richards is “a great player.” But that
does not mean that Hackett’s philosophy has changed: “I
can't compromise what I’m asking 100 guys to do for the
sake of one player. ” In other words, if everybody else has
to do it, so does Richards.

But Hackett is trying to be fair. He stated that Richards
will be welcomed back once his problems have been
cleared up. Now the decision will be up to Richards. He
could turn professional, or he could clear up his problems
and return for his senior season.

If Hackett’s decision was based on Richards’ poor
academic record, we support it entirely. After all, this is a
university which, above all, should display academic
talent, not a playground to show off athleticism.

“You come to school to get an education, and he needs
to understand that that is the top priority,” Hackett said.
“And asl have said to the team many times, nothing will
compromise our commitment to academics." It's a shame
that Richards had to discover that fact the hard way.

Editor's note: The following
letter is a response to an earlier

Thank you for expressing your
views on the Persian Gulf
situation. As an elected body
which represents the interests of
all students, we are not justiﬁed
in taking a stand on this issue one
way or the other. Please
understand that were we to
choose a side, we would not be
representing our entire
constituency. While we
acknowledge your views, we also
must acknowledge the views of
the other side.

that our official statement was
made independently from
President Posvar’s statement. The
fact that they concur in opinion
results from our similar but
separate positions on the issue.

In the days and weeks before

are ﬁghting for our country, and,
as citizens of this country, the

deeply appreciate the tremendous
risk and sacrifice of these
courageous people for our
country. We pray for their safe
return to America.

Pro-lifers get a chance

I am writing this letter to
commend The Pitt News, and
speciﬁcally Tammy Stradley, for
coverage of two recent pro-life-
related events. What surprised
me was that these articles were
featured on the front page and
not buried in the back like in
most publications.

We pro-life people do not want
preferential treatment in the media
over pro-abortionists; we would
just like equal and honest
treatment. Unfortunately, most
reporters are not pro-life and
therefore do not cover pro-life
events. Reporting should be
objective and not clouded by
personal convictions or politics.

The stories by Tammy Stradley
were very easy to read and stated
the facts purely and simply. These
articles were news coverage in
the purest sense. No personal
opinions, just the facts. Bravo!

I thank The Pitt News and Ms.
Stradley for printing these articles.
Being a college newspaper, I
think it's pretty bold to cover
events so fairly without being
swayed by outside interests. All
pro-life people want is equal
coverage. Then, let the people
decide.

Problems aren't new

I am writing in reference to the
editorial “They’re Doing it All
Wrong...” I enjoyed reading the
editorial, and I agree that this
issue’ should not be ignored in
this time of crisis. There were two
items that I thought were
inaccurate.

First, I do not believe that lines
for food and clothes are new to
the Soviet Union. There have
been many documentaries on
public television that have noted
this. What is different about this
occasion is, as you noted, the
logistics of getting the food to the
market. The most popular expla-
nations for this that I have heard
are difﬁculties in transportation
and lack of workers to harvest
the crop. This is the first time that
people were not forced to assist
with the harvest.

The other item that I took
exception to was comparing
Lithuania to the Civil War. This is
a misleading comparison.
Lithuania was an independent
country before World War II,
when Hitler and Stalin signed a
non-aggression pact and
Germany invaded Poland. During
the invasion, Germany also
occupied portions of Lithuania,
and the Soviet Union occupied
the remaining areas as per the
previous agreement.[...l

‘Full support’...
Bozik backs Hackett in de

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Pitt athletic director Ed Bozik
said that football coach Paul
Hackett has his “full support and
total approval” of Hackett’s
decision to suspend star fullback
Curvin Richards indeﬁnitely from
the team.

According to Bozik, the
decision to suspend Richards for
a violation of team rules and
policies was a coach’s decision.

“In all cases, coaches discuss
this with me before they make
these ﬁnal decisions. In this
particular instance, Coach Hackett
did discuss this with me,” Bozik
said.

According to The Pittsburgh
Press, “sources within the football
program said the punishment
stemmed from Richards’ poor
academic record, absences from
study halls and failing to attend
team meetings.”

The specific reasons regarding
Richards’ suspension have yet to
be officially stated, but the
possibility of its academic roots
brings up the university’s policy

regarding continuing-education
requirements for athletes.

The NCAA does not set
standards for continuing
eligibility; rather, such standards
are institution-speciﬁc. The NCAA
states, in a nutshell, that a student
athlete is supposed to be making
normal progress toward a degree.
According to Bozik, Pitt's
continuing-eligibility standards
are more stringent than those at
some universities and not as
stringent as others.

Pitt requires its athletes to
maintain a minimum 1.80 quality-
point average and carry 24 credits
in their freshman year. In the
sophomore year, if athletes had a
2.0 in the freshman year with 24
credits, they need a 1.80, carrying
50 credits in the sophomore year.
As a junior, if athletes have a 2.0
in the sophomore year, they need
a 1.90, carrying 80 credits as a
junior. Finally, as a senior, they
need a minimum 2.0 and 104
credits.

“Our coaches have no problem
with continuing-eligibility
standards  They have no choice.

Mans gym ta/ees Shenandoah Valley Invitational

By Sharon Kerestes
sum“ Writer

The men’s gymnastics team
proved Saturday that last week’s
outstanding season-opening
performance at William and Mary
was no fluke. Pitt scored 268.85
points, beating last week’s score
by seven tenths, to win the
Shenandoah Valley Invitational
at James Madison University.

William and Mary finished
second with 257.70, followed by
Radford (243.75). JMIJ (228.50),
and California Polytecli (209.60).

Pitt also continued its success
mi pomrnel ll()I'.\rf7 and scored a
z’t't‘<>:‘tl—.\tTll1I1g 1": 516?.

“( )ur pommel horse just
whipped everybody,” said coach
I-‘rank D’Amico. “We never had a
side horse team that could score
45 points. I’ve had some good
people but I’ve never had four or
five guys that could throw it.”

Genaro Severino, Brock
Freehling, Jorge Gonzalez, and
Dave Bausmith all scored 9.0 or

better on the event in
preliminaries and all four
advanced to ﬁnals. William and
Mary’s David Williams placed first
in ﬁnals (9.50), and Severino
(9.35) and Gonzalez (8.40)
finished second and third
respectively.

Gonzalez also led Pitt’s
domination in the all-around
competition. He‘ scored 55.1 to
win, followed by Danny Krovich
of William and Mary (54.25), and
Pitt’s Severino (53.75), Bausmith
(53.15), and Freehling (52.4).

The improvement in the overall
team score may seem small, but
D’Amico said the Panthers
performed much better then they
did last week. The judging was
more difficult at JMU than at
William and Mary, he said, and
that it was hard to compare the
two meets based on scores alone.

D’Amico felt William and Mary’s
team, which improved it’s overall
score by 4.4, also looked much
better on Saturday. They
threatened the Panthers in only

two events however, parallel bars
and high bar. Pitt had trouble on
those events last week and their
problems continued at JMU.

After the first three events,
pommels, floor and rings,
D’Amico again had hopes of
breaking the school record of
272. But again his team faltered
on parallel bars and high bar and
came up less than four points
shy of the target mark.

“It really hurts the team when
we can see how good we’re
doing and then all ofsudden, the
momentum sort of stops when
we start to fall apart,” l)’.»\mico
said. “That's the way those events
go. The littlest thing can go wrong
and you fall off.”

Even so, he said the teams
scores on those events weren’t
bad and with more practice, the
mistakes can be ironed out.

“We’re really doing some very’
difficult routines,” he said. “We’re :
capable of [overcoming] the:
difficulty. It's just hard to put itt
together. I’m gearing this week’ss
practice to try to improve those:
events.”

He has to, because those events ;
happen to be the strenths of Pitt’s ;

matched and D’Amico said it will
be the Panther’s toughest
challenge so far. Both teams are
highly-ranked in the east this
year and Kent St. also scored a
268 in its opening meet two weeks
ago.

D’Amico summed it up, “It’s
going to be a tense meet.”

Riding a wave ofmomentum
started by the divers, the Pitt
men’s swim team surged to a
131-105 victory at Villanova

on Saturday.
Earlier in the week, head
coach Chuck Knoles

expressed concern about
motivating his swimmers for
this meet. The team had to
deal with distractions such as
a five—and-a-ha1f—hour bus ride
the day of the competition.
But after the divers finished
their work, the team was able
to pour it on.

“In the second half, we really
showed our depth,” said
assistant coach Mike Kozlina,
“Dave Shepner had a really
good 500-meter freestyle; Joe

Pitt swims to 131-105
victory over Villanova

lKo/.linal, l)on Boyd and line
Mattson also swam very well.
The divers helped out a lot,
too. But the second half ofthe
meet was the difference.”
With many of the swimmers
looking ahead two weeks to
the Big East Championships,
Pitt didn’t post many
outstanding times. But it was
still able to get the job done.
“We just wanted to get the
win and get out of there,” said
Kozlina, “because tomorrow
we start tapering [our training]
for the Big ‘ East
Championships.”

The team is gearing up to
defend its eight consecutive
Big East titles. Pitt will again
host the three—day event
beginning on Feb. 7 in Trees
Pool.

Lady Panthers set new record at home opener '

Byjohn Labriola
Stqﬂ‘ Writer

Pitt’s wornen’s gymnastics team
held its home opener last Saturday
by hosting and defeating the Lady
Wildcats of the University of New
Hampshire 185.35 to 183.75 and
setting a new school record.

Leading the Lady Panthers this
weekend was sophomore Kristin
Brown, who set her career-high
all—around score to tie Lisa Shirk’s
1984 score of 37.55. “lt’s always
fun when you break records,”
said Brown. ‘

In the vaulting competition Pitt
performed its vaults very cleanly
and scored a 45.85. According to
Coach Debbie Yohman, the Lady
Panthers are competing with
average—difficuIty vaults and
performing them very well.
Turning in strong performances
for the Lady Panthers were Gina
Venezia (9.30), Carrie Carnesale
(9.25), Kathy Wallish (9.15), Tina
Taylor (9.10) and Brown.

On the uneven parallel bars
the Lady Panthers seta new school
record of 46.40, breaking the old
record from 1987 by .05.

“This is the new and improved
Pitt bar squad,” said Brown. “We
work our butts off on bars, and

Carrie Carnesale scored a 9.25 in the vault and and 9.20 on the bars in Pitt's opening gymnastics match against University of New Hampshire.

we’re doing darn good too.”

Even though the Lady Panthers
just set a new record, they want
to continue to add difficulty to
their routines.

“Jeannie [Vecchiol is still doing
an A—dismount, and she's getting
a‘ deduction for that,” said
Yohman. “Next week, hopefully
we’ll have a stronger dismount

in there.”

Turning in strong performances
on the bars were Brown (9.40),
Taylor (9.35), Wallish (9.30).
Carnesale (9.20) and Vecchio
(9.15).

The Lady Panthers began to
show signs of returning to an
aggressive style of performance
on the balance beam. Although
there still were a few faults, the
Lady Panthers seemed to be
coming into their own once again.
They tied the school record of
46.55 that they set last season.

“They were much more
aggressive on beam than [they
were] last week,” said Yohman.
“With a little more aggressiveness
and a little more confidence, beam
will come around and get better.”

Turning in fine beam
performances for Pitt were Brown
(9.55), Taylor (9.35), Venezia

Johnson

(9.30), Karen Jorgensen (9.20)
and Wallish (9.15).

The floor exercises turned in
by the Lady Panthers were strong,
but there were a few flaws in
some of the routines that are
normally not seen in the Lady
Panthers’ performances.

During T aylor’s first tumbling
run she knelt down after
performing a double back ﬂip
about seven feet off the ground.

“Tina’s double back was so
high that I didn’t know how she
would ever get her feet
underneath her,” said Yohman.

Strong performances were
turned in by Brown (9.55),
Jorgensen (9.35), Taylor (9.30),
Vecchio (9.25) and Wallish (9.00).

This weekend the Lady
Panthers will be traveling north
to meet with the Beacons of the
University of Massachusetts.

proud of in her Pitt career.
“We just didn’t know each
other. After a while we went into
games wondering if we could

win. Losing was on our mind too
much,” Johnson said. “Beating
William and Mary [on Dec. 30]
got us back on track. We needed
a win going into the Big East.”

Lady Wildcats sink Pitt 1 61 -133

By Chris Kuzneski
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Villanova concluded its regular
season with a 161-153 upset
victory over the Lady Panther
swim team on Saturday. The loss
dropped Pitt’s dual-meet record
to 7-3 and secured Villanova’s
position as the favorite in the Big
East Championships.

“Villanova has become the team
to beat in the Big East," said Pitt
Coach David Belowich, who
recorded his worst season since
1982-83 (2-5). “They really swam
a nice meet.”

Pitt freshman Jennifer Burns

kept Pitt close with a victory in
the 100-yard backstroke (1:01.86)
and a second-place ﬁnish in the
200 backstroke (2: 12.85).
Christine Gallagher also
contributed a victory in the 100
freestyle (53.37) and second place
in the S0 freestyle (24.88).

“I was very pleased with how
Jennifer swam,” said Belowich,
“She can be a very fine swimmer
here at Pitt. [Gallagher] also had
a very good meet.”

Pitt’s divers managed to sweep
one—two-three in both the 1- and
3—meter, with Mindy Hennon,
Diane Chrnielewski and Krissa
Ratliff leading the way.

“Villanova had no competition
in the diving,” said Belowich,
“but the girls performed quite
well anyway.” ,

With the regular season behind
them, Belowich now looks to
Feb. 7, and the start of the Big
East Championships at Trees Hall.

“We lost a little momentum
with the loss, but I have a
tremendous feeling that we can
accomplish more. They realized
that they can do a better job, but
it will take a great effort,” said
Belowich,

“If we focus ourselves and rest
physically and mentally, we can
do it. I have faith in the team.”

Require
Continued from page 8

Those are not unreasonable
standards for normal progress. If
you’re going to be on line to
graduate, stepping [the
requirements] up as you go from
your first to your fourth year [is
logical],” Bozik said.

The NCAA’s minimum
standards require student athletes
to carry a minimum of 24, 48, 72
and 96 credits, respectively,
during the freshman through
senior years.

Also, Bozik said that the athletic
department had no complaints
with either the continuing-
eligibility requirements or the
initial standards which allow a
prospective student or student
athlete to be subject to review
before admission. Pitt requires
its athletes to score at least a 730
on the Scholastic Aptitude Test,
have a 2.3 QPA and be in the top

three—fifths of their high—school
class.

The requirements apply to all
athletes in all sports, revenue or
non-revenue. However, it must
be taken into account that the
decision to suspend an athlete or
athletes from a team when
borderline academic performance
is involved is basically a coach’s
decision. Thus, an athlete could
in fact suffer from poor academic
status and remain a participating
member of a team, subject to the
coach’s review.

Pitt’s academic requirements
and decisions like the one
involving Richards could possibly
be viewed as a detriment by
prospective athletes, who may
initially view collegiate sports as
a gateway to professional leagues
and have little regard for the
importance of academics. Bozik
stated Pitt has always wanted to

accomplish loftier aims and the
university’s policy stresses
academics first and athletics
second.

“Well, it may be detrimental in
some people’s eyes, but overall,
[enforcing academic standards] is
a very positive sign. There are
kids and parents out there who
are thinking about where they
want to go to school, and most
parents would say, ‘Hey, I want
my youngster to graduate, and I
want somebody that cares about
their academic progress,” Bozik
said.

“If We’re here to [accomplish]
our primary mission, which is to
educate people, then we should
pay attention to that. And I find it
very salutatory to have coaching
staffs who are committed to that
goal,” he added.

Bar—none, there are plenty of area pubs with grub

By Spencer Borisoff
saw‘ Writer

One portion of the play Oliver
Tlwistreads, “Food, glorious food,
hot sausage and mustard."

If, however, students at the
University of Pittsburgh were
allowed the opportunity to rewrite
this phrase, then it would
probably read more like this:
“Bar food, glorious bar food, hot
wings and blue cheese.”

Barhoppers of all ages
frequently ﬁnd that their little
“buzzes” transform into big
appetites. To accommodate their
desires to drink and eat, bargoers
especially appreciate a bar
atmosphere which does both the
former and the latter. I

“I enjoy going to bars that offer
both food and drinks because I
hate having to leave a bar when
I get hungry. If I leave, then
there’s a chance I'll lose my buzz,”
Pitt student Ed Croot said.

In an effort to support the
student body’s savage partying
propensity, many on-campus bars

have designated speciﬁc nights
of the week as some sort of grub-
and-chug deals. The most
distinctive bargains in town are
the wing-ding deals, which almost
every bar offers.

On Monday nights both Zelda’s
Greenhouse and Peter’s Pub
(both in South Oakland) have a
wing night. Zelda’s sells wings
for 20 cents each, asks 50 cents
extra for both blue cheese and

celery and charges 50 Cents I0?
draft beer and 60 cents for pony
beers.

Peter’s, on the other hand, offers
10 wings for $2.25, 20 wings for
$3.75 and does not charge extra

for celery or blue-cheese dip,

Peter’s asks $3.50 for eight pony 5

bottles of Rolling Rock,
Budweiser, Bud Lite and Miller
Genuine Draft.

Tuesday nights belong
exclusively to Oakland’s C._]_
Bamey’s. It serves wings for 20
cents apiece, charges $1 extra for
an order of blue cheese and celery
and offers three Busch drafts for
$1.

At Caleco’s in South Oakland,

wing night is Wednesday night, .

Caleco’s sells 15 wings for $3, 20
wings for $3.75, offers celery and
blue cheese free and charges $1
for all types of Miller beer.

Both Thirsty’s in North Oakland
and the Sod in South Oakland
boast Thursday night as wing
night. Thirsty’s soaks their wings
in a not-too-spicy butter sauce,
asks $3 for 12 of them and sells
pitchers of Molson for $4.

“They're the best wings I've
ever had,” said bartender Keith
McGurk.

The Sod serves wings for $3 a
basket and also offers blue cheese
and celery for no charge.

Even those bars which have
more extensive menus and
kitchens that are open until later
hours ﬁnd wings to be their most
popular bar food.

C.J.’s offers soups, sandwiches,
salads, appetizers, Mexican food
and 12 different burgers with all
types of toppings, ranging from
just cheese to guacamole and
sour cream. Still, wings are the
overwhelming favorite on the
menu.

“Wings and nachos are ordered
the most,” server Laurene Carter
said. “Just recently I sold over $99
worth of wings in one night, and
that was on a Monday night.”

Joe, a cook at C.J.’s, said, “Our '

wings are one of a kind, and
people come from far and wide
to eat them,” he said.

Another cook, Brian Tennent,
concurred, “The wing master
[referring to himself] is always at
work."

Aussie’s Down Under Pub 8:
Grill in Bloomﬁeld has a multitude
of options when it comes to bar
food as well. It charges between
$3.95 and $4.95 for potato skins,
depending on the type, $2.95 for
nachos and $3.95 for five cheese
sticks. Wings, not surprisingly,
are also a crowd favorite. No item
on the menu, however, is as
popular as the Aussie burger
($5.50) which is topped with just
abouteverything but the kitchen
sink.

“The food is an integral part of
a good time at Aussie’s,” bartender
Rob Zgonc said.

The South Side’s Blue Lou’s.
likewise, has quite an extensive
menu, and the kitchen serves
food until midnight.

The fried provolone cheese
wheel ($2.50), Blue Lou’s famous
Mexican pizza ($4.95) and the
nacho mountain served with
cheese, salsa and peppers ($5.95)
are all available on the menu.
Still, wings remain the crowd
favorite there as well ($4 a dozen)-

“On Wednesday night we have
wing night — 15 cents per wing
and 75 cents for Coors Lights --
but regardless, we sell lots of bar

Night moves...

After hours dining for the midnight gourmet
By_]essicaCoville  .   A V A   . i ’

 

     

It’s 1:30 a.m., and the bars are
about to close. Your roommate
is fighting with her boyfriend,
and you have two finals
tomorrow. Fear not — Oakland
has its share of late-night eateries
to satiate those insistent munchies.

Are you feeling possessed with
an urge to mingle? Then head
over to G’s in North Oakland on
Melwood Street. (If you’ve been
doing your drinking at Mitchell’s,
you’ll be very fortunate. The two
establishments are connected.)
Dine with the likes of the Grateful
Dead or the Beatles in this cozy

L L restaurant that looks like a poster-
€¥ gallery tribute to musical artists.

From huge chicken sandwiches
to the self-proclaimed “best
Philadelphia cheese steaks” in
Pittsburgh, you will not leave G’s
hungry or broke. The average
dinner (sandwich, fries and Coke)
will cost you about $7. If you’re
nice to G, he’ll even let you play
your own cassette tapes on the
restaurant’s stereo system.

If you feel like being in a more
intimate restaurant, meander on
over to the White Tower on Craig

By William Graves
Sta_[7' Writer

Lobster tails in hot butter, filets
in white wine, ﬂaky seafood and
hearty pasta dishes are often only
the elusive dreams of an average
University of Pittsburgh student.
Students who use Choice Dollars
to eat at Roy Rogers and the
Schenley Cafe dream of the day
when these scrumptious delights
will be made available; they wait
for a visit from Mom and Dad.

On the corner of Atwood and
Bates streets is Angel’s Corner,
another favorite of students and
their families. “People bring their
kids in for graduation, birthdays
or just during a visit,” said Angel’s
Corner employee Skip Jackson.

Here two can try a grilled veal
chop ($22.95), filet mignon
($21.95) or Norwegian salmon
($19.95) for between $40 and
$50. The cost is about $10 more
if wine is ordered, said Jackson.
While the atmosphere at Angel’s
Corner is mainly considered
romantic (it was once a church),

families are made to feel
comfortable by the personal
service.

Poli’s Restaurant on Murray
Avenue is widely known for its
varied and always fresh seafood
dishes. Delores Poli said, “Parents
from out of town take their kids
here because they have heard
about us.”

These students can eat shrimp
wrapped in zucchini ($15.95),
bass wrapped in sliced potato
with alioolio spinach ($16.95) or
Poli’s signature dish, the jumbo
seafood platter ($23.50).

Poli said the atmosphere is
intimate, but that the menu “is
geared to the old and the young.”
Poli added that any two appetizers
and entrees on the menu will cost
about $25 dollars a person,
including a few drinks and a tip.

Per Favore is located on
Bigelow Boulevard where the
Park Schenley used to stand, but
according to executive chef Chris
Chirun, “The Park Schenley did
not even come close.”

Markowitz said. “The bar
atmosphere is a lot of fun, but
make no mistake, that without
wings and things — to eat, that is
—— it just wouldn't be the same,”
he continued.

According to Donna, a server
and a bartender at Hemingway’s
Cafe
appetizers, including wings, mini
pizzas and calamari, interest most
people who drink at the bar.
“The people at the bar like the
ﬁnger foods,” she said. “They like
the munchies.”

Pitt News picks Pittsburgh ’s best

Pizza. Macaroni and cheese. I-Ioagies. Does that sound
like your diet! College students have a reputation of eating
anything and everything —— not that they don’t want good
food. The trouble is, quality eats are often hard to ﬁnd. But

“here is a list of places that The Pitt News finds worthy of:

special attention.

PIZZA: The college student's staple. With so many
places offering specials, discounts, etc., it's hard to cut
through the cheese and find a quality pie. But we feel that
Napoli’s at 210 Atwood and Aiello’s at 2112 Murray Ave.,
are clearly a slice above the rest. Lots of cheese. Lots of
toppings. Several sizes. Delicious. Affordable. What else
can you ask for from a pizza place?

QUICKEST DELIVERY: I-ial’s Pizza, 234 Meyran Ave.
T wenty—frve minutes or less. Guaranteed. We haven't had
to complain yet.

HOAGIES: Two places in Oakland tie for top hoagie.
Uncle Sam’s, 210 Oakland Ave., offers great sandwiches at
reasonable prices. Sam expanded his place over the
summer to accommodate the crowds that are known to
frequent the establishment. If you don’t know Sam per-
sonally, introduce yourself, and he'll remember you the
next time you go. G’s — A Taste of South Philly, 4632
Centre Ave., offers huge subs at great prices. The walls of
G's are lined with rock posters from the '60s and '70s, and
the same music blares throughout the room. And where
else in Oakland can you get soda served in real jelly jars?

FRIES: Everyone knows how great “O fries” at the
Original Hot Dog Stand, 3901 Forbes Ave., taste at 1 a.m.
on a Friday or Saturday, but there are a lot of other top-
quality spuds out there. Uncle Sam’s gives a generous
portion free with any hoagie, as long as you eat it there.
That’s enough to make a “best of’ list in itself. Among fast
food joints, Wendy's thick, puffy potatoes rate the highest.

WINGS: Peter’s Pub, 116 Oakland Ave., on Mondays;
the S.O.D., 403 Semple St., on Thursdays; and Caleco’s,
214 Oakland Ave., on Wednesday. Unfortunately, those
are the only nights that these three places serve them, but
a basket of spicy at any of the three places ought to keep
your mouth burning for a few days.

ITALIAN: Pasta Piatto, 738 Bellefonte St., is generally
regarded as having the city’s best Italian fare, specializing
in Northern cuisine. But Alexander's Pasta Express, 5104
Liberty Ave., also offers outstanding variety and prices
more suitable to college students.

HAMBURGERS: The Elbow Room, 5744 1/2 Ellsworth
Ave., and Tessaro’s, 4601 Liberty Ave. Big, sloppy and
juicy. Just the way Mom used to make them.

. backyard to find what you're looking for; in

 

FRENCH: Simply French, 346 Atwood St.
Sometimes you only have to look in your own

this case the best country French dishes in
Pittsburgh are only a short walk away.

CHINESE: Sometimes you only have to
look in your own backyard, but sometimes

you have to go to Monroeville, too. That’s
where you’ll find Hunan Garden, 3775 Wil-
liam Penn Highway, specializing in Hunan
cuisine. Jimmy Tsang’s Chinese Restaurant,
5700 Centre Ave., is also excellent, with a
wider variety of dishes.

MEXICAN: Margaritaville, 2200 E. Carson
St. You don’t have to make a run for the
border; there is a good Mexican restaurant in
Pittsburgh after all.

STEAK: Ruth's Chris Steak House, 6 PPG
Place, is the best, but you may have to use
your student loan to afford a steak there.
Tessaro’s, 4601 Liberty Ave., is much more
affordable and almost as good.

SANDWICHES: Primanti’s, 3803 Forbes and
46 18th St in the Strip District. It sounds a little
strange at first, but cole slaw and fries in your
sandwich can become addictive.

BRUNCH: Grand Concourse, 1 Station
Square. If you've never tried the brunch at the
Grand Concourse, don’t be ashamed. Just go
this Sunday. '

DESSERTS: Gullifty’s, 1922 Murray Ave.
Name your favorite dessert, and Gullifty’s
probably has it .

ICE CREAM: Dave and Andy’s Homemade
Ice Cream, 207 Atwood St. You can see the ice
cream being made. Enough said.

RIBS: Hot Licks, located in the Motor Square
Garden, have the hottest ribs around —— just
ask Louis Lipps. Wilson’s Bar-B-Q, 3404 Penn
Ave., is also X-L-ent. '

GYROS: Niko’s Gyros, 424 Semple St. Niko’s has the
best gyros this side of the Parthenon — or at least the Mon
River.

PANCAKES: Pamela’s, 3703 Forbes Ave. Chocolate-
chip pancakes? Pamela’s has them, as well as strawberries-
with-cream pancakes, banana pancakes and several more
original kinds of ﬂapjacks that can be ordered all day long.

HOT DOGS: The O, 3901 Forbes Ave. How could you

3°‘-im B!vd_

even think of picking anybody else for this one?
DELI: Rhoda’s Deli Restaurant, 2201 Murray Ave. Every-,

thing from corned beef to chicken soup with matzo balls.‘ . ‘

SOUP: Herningway’s, 3911 Forbes Ave. The wedding
soup is good enough to save any marriage. -31-, .
SUSHI: Oakside Inn, N. Craig St. You.probably know
sushi is raw fish —— but no, it doesn’t come in big, slimy
slabs. Here's yourchance to find out what it’ really is.

Vegetarian does not have to mean salads and

By Donna Terrell
sum‘ Writer

College vegetarians have
probably, at one time or another,
faced the problem of ﬁnding a
vegetarian meal at an affordable
price. Variety and affordability
are top priorities for the budget-
conscious college vegetarian who
has grown tired of grilled-cheese
sandwiches‘ and iceberg-lettuce
salads.

Middle Eastern and Asian
restaurants almost always offer
reasonably priced, unique
vegetarian dishes. The Star of
India at 412 Craig Street in
Oakland boasts 23 vegetarian
dishes.

For an affordable lunch ($3.95),
appetizer-bread combinations are
recommended. For $2.35, two
appetizers are available: Samosa,
a deep-fried potato and green-
pea turnover, and Vegetable Chat
Indira, a fruit and vegetable
medley served with sweet and
sour dip. If you want to try
something really different, Raita
($1.15) is spiced yogurt with
tomato and cucumber.

Any one of the seven types of
bread offered will go well with
the appetizers. Paratha is a ﬂaky,
buttered bread stuffed with
shredded potatoes, peas and

spices, or shredded cauliﬂower.
Both cost $2.95. Nan bread is
served with fresh garlic or onion
($2.35). '

Similar to most restaurants,
every item on the Star of India’s

vegetarian dinner menu is priced"

under $10. For $8.35, vegetarians
can choose from Bindimasala
(okra cooked with tomatoes and

spices), Palak Aloo (potatoes,
spinach, tomatoes and light cream
with cinnamon) and Channa Baji
(chick peas, tomatoes, ginger,
garlic and onions).

If you prefer Asian food,
lunchtime offers a limited choice.
However, several places offer
affordable and interesting dinner
selections.

Local dining for $15 or less

By Linda Holley
Staff Writer

IfS1S from the last plasma donation to Sera-Tec is all the money
you have left to spend on a dinner date, don’t panic. Getting
quality food at affordable prices is still possible. Two people can
enjoy a sit—down dinner at any of the following locations for $15
or less. .

Just a five—minute walk from campus, North Oakland offers a
wide array of restaurants where the hungry can indulge.

For the not-so-daring diners, Great Scot specializes in American
bounty. The menu is changed once a month so regulars may
stimulate their taste buds without curry or Szechuan seasonings
shocking their systems.

Hamburgers are ordered most frequently at Great Scot. The
restaurant offers six types of burgers, which come with a side of
sweet or regular potato chips and a seasonal salad. The favorites
are the Crunch Burger (American cheese, bean sprouts, water
chestnuts and soy sauce for $6.75) and the Golden Triangle
Burger (Monterey Jack cheese, bacon, avocado and sour cream
for $6.75).

Great Scot is located at 413 S. Craig Street. Its hours are Monday
to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 11 pm.; Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to
midnight; and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Also in North Oakland is the Darbar Indian Restaurant. It offers
vegetarian and non-vegetarian dinners. The most popular dishes
are the tandoori chicken ($6.95) or the bodi kebab masala, which
is a lamb kebab ($8.95). The tandoori mixed grill includes
chicken, lamb and shrimp for $7.95.

Darbar is located at 4519 Centre Avenue. Dinner is served
Monday to Friday from 5 to 10 p.m., and from 5 to 10:30 p.m. on
weekends. It also offers a lunch buffet from 11:30 a.m. to 2:50
p.m., Monday to Saturday.

Eats-n-Beats

Frolickmg and foods
in a lively atmosphere

By Scot Ross
Editor in Chief

Eating and entertainment goes
hand in hand in Pittsburgh, with
restaurants whose live
entertainment ranges from
authentic Irish folk music to
performance art.

D’Amico’s, located in
Bloomﬁeld at 4744 Liberty Ave.,
gives patrons the opportunity to
sing along with the piano player.
Elda D’Amico said, “We have
everything from A to Z. You pick
a letter, and they play it.”

D’Amico’s also offers the
unusual combination of Italian
food and country music.

“We seem to try a little bit of
everything. We had the country
music before the restaurant, and
everybody seemed to like it, so
we kept it,” said D’Amico. Dine

on the lasagne for $4.95, or the
linguini with white clam sauce
for $5.95.

A potpourri of dining and visual
entertainment is the atmosphere
of Shadyside’s Artery on 5847
Ellsworth Ave. Employing not
only a visual—arts director, but
also a range of cerebral and
aesthetic programs, the Artery is,
according to director Melissa
Manesiotis, “a very innovative
place.”

The Artery has a number of
different entertainment options,
including art galleries and live
theatrical performances.

“First and foremost was lfindin g]
a space for everything. People
who see a theater might not see
a gallery. When they come in for
dinner, patrons get a chance to

see some contemporary works.

Continued from page 11
Moving out of Oakland, but

still only a ﬁve-minute ride from
campus, is Shadyside.

The Elbow Room has two
dining rooms and a back patio
for dining under the stars when
the weather permits.

It offers a variety of salads, a
light line and burgers and
sandwiches, along with a list of
munchies and desserts. The hot
chicken salad ($4.95/small or
$5.95/large) and the steak salad
($4.50/small or $5.50/large) are
favorites among customers. The
lasagne dinner, which comes with
sausage, a green salad and a roll
and butter, is also popular ($5. 95).

The Elbow Room is located at
5744 1/2 Ellsworth Avenue. It is
open seven days a week from 11
a.m. to 1 a.m.

Traveling deeper into the heart
of Shadyside is the China Palace
on Walnut Street. It offers
traditional selections from Peking
and Szechuan province. It
specializes in Mandarin ﬂavoring,
replacing rice with steamed wheat

buns, and Human and Szechuan
styles, which use garlic, ginger,
hot peppers and Szechuan
peppercorns to create hot and
spicy dishes.

Enjoy the popular chicken and
cashews for $7.95, or the palace
vegetable delight for $6.95.

Located at 5440 Walnut Street,
the China Palace is open Monday
to Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 9:30
p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 11:30
a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; and Sundays,
3 to 9 p.m.

Bloomﬁeld also has an abun-
dance of restaurants where dinner
for two won't cost a fortune.

D’Amico’s specializes in Italian
cuisine. All of the pasta is
homemade, from the angel hair
to the linguini, and the appetizers
are made from scratch, too.

Dinners include a bowl of fresh
soup and a salad. The most
popular entrees are the lasagne
dinner ($4.95) and the linguini
and white clam sauce ($5.75).

D’Amico’s is located at 4744
Liberty Avenue. Hours are from
10 a.m. to 2 a.m.

Its competition, right down the
street, is Alexander’s Pasta
Express. Homemade Italiansauoe
is the specialty here. It offers over
10 different sauces. Put together
a plate of pasta, and select a
sauce for $6.25 or less.

It also serves sandwiches,
hoagies and parmigiano and
casseroles. Veal patty parmigiano
is $4.95, and comes with a side of
the chefs choice of pasta.

Alexander's is located at 5104
Liberty Avenue. It is open Monday
to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11
p.m., and Sundays from noon to
10 p.m.

Toward Squirrel Hill in
Greenﬁeld is Big _Iim’s. It offers a
variety of sandwiches and pastas.
Every sandwich has half a pound
of meat on it, which explains
why Big Jim’s motto is, “We have
the biggest sandwiches in town.”
The favorites are the corned beef
($5), the Reuben ($5.25) and the
steak hoagie ($5).

Located at 201 Saline Street,
Big Jim’s is open seven days a
week from 11 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.

We open up the avenues to
people who come here,” she said.

For a more ethnic option,
Murphy’s Tap Room, in Regent
Square at 1106 S. Braddock Ave.,
features authentic Irish music by
the band Guaranteed Irish.
Manager Patrick Cauley said, “We
have traditional, classic Irish music
with pipes and ﬂutes. They’re
very good. People love them,” he
said.

Cauley said that the music
attracts an older crowd. “But I
wouldn't want to say it like people
in their 20s wouldn't like it. It’s
good for all ages,” he said.

The Tap Room offers the
Murphy’s Combo double

AC sandwich with two meats for

5

$4.25.

To experience a variety of
different music, Charyl Hays of
the Penn Cafe at 4104 Penn Ave.,
said to check out this Bloomﬁeld
restaurant.

“We deal everywhere from folk,
bluegrass, rock ‘n’ roll, rhythm
and blues to country. We have a
sing-along banjo player, and we
have standard bands that come
here and pack the place,” Hays
said.

Penn Cafe offers an eight-ounce
prime sirloin steak with potato
and salad for $7.25, as well as
chicken or veal parmigiana for
the same price.

The Balcony at 5520 Walnut St.
in Shadyside features a
predominantly jazz—oriented
musical arrangement, although
according to owner Muzz Meyers,
the Balcony Big Band plays a

Monday-night set of big-band
music.

“People love the music. It’s
something people don’t usually
hear," he said. On Mondays and
Tuesdays, the Balcony features a
New Orleans-style shrimp feast.
It’s all—you-can-eat shrimp with
sides of Cajun dishes for $16.95.
One can also try the cashew or
Santa Fe chicken at $11.95.
