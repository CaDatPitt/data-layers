You Ain’t Got No Alabi
Stqff Writer

Pitt students who are familiar with study-
ing at Hillman Library, watching sporting
events at Nordy’s Place in the William’ Pitt
Union and even living in Litchﬁeld Towers
will have to prepare themselves for some
major changes in the upcoming months.

As part of his ﬁve-point “G-Plan,” Chan-
cellor— elect Patrick Gallagher will be renam-
ing multiple buildings on campus to reﬂect
his ascension to the leadership post. The
details of the other four parts of his plan
will be unveiled at a laterdate.

“I just want to change it all,” Gallagher
said at a recent press conference. “I want
to let it be known that there’s a new person
inytown and he’s here to stay.”

The “Gallagherizing,” as he called it,
of Pitt’s Oakland campus will involve not
only the changing of the names of multiple
buildings, but also the implementation of
tiny ‘G’s placed all over campus.

As part of this plan, Nordy’s will be
changed to Gally’s, Towers A, B and C willbe
renamed “Towers G,” and Hillman Library
will be rebranded as Gallagher Library.

While some students on campus have

questioned the reasoning behind these A

decisions, they have not questioned his
authority. , ' _ '

“I,think it costs a lot of money to do all
of this, but I mean, he can do whatever he
wants, right? Doesn’t he have immunity or
something?” Laura Palmer, an underwater
basket—weaving major, said.

Other students didn’t seem to care about
the announced changes. .

“All I need to do is study for a calculus
test in the library. Do you think-Iim going

to care if I’m studying in the Gallagher or
the Hillman? Of course not)’ Mark Jones, _

a junior physics major, said.

The transformation of Nordy’s Place into _

Gally~’s Place will be the ﬁrst of Gallagher’s
many changes. ' I - '

‘ “There’s goingto be a big sign and we
are rebranding all of our paraphernalia. It’s

going to be awesome. ‘G’s everywhere!” Pitt .

spokesmanjohn Fedele said. I
While some students werehappy about

the changes coming to campus, others were _

less than thrilled.
“You just can’t keep changing and chang-
ing it. What are you going to do next, change

the name of the school?” Francis Chase, a

Player

freshman bioengineering major, said.
Changing the name of the school is, in
fact, among Gallagher’s long-term plans

4 more Board members ‘too cool’ for Pitt’s studentgovernment

A What does Dafox say
Co7ztrz'butz'ng Pz'ttg'/"ul News Writer

Four more are out the door — Student
Government Board members tried to save
face last night by jumping ship on a sinking
SGB legacy. g ’ 4

Board members Abby Zurschmit, Sara
Klein, Graeme Meyer and Mona Kazour an-
nounced their resignations Monday night
after they called an emergency public meet-
ing that no members of the student body
attended. This newest string represents the
third slew of Board resignations in three
months, and only President Mike Nites and
Board member Andrew Abboud remain to,
quite literally, man SGB.

The resigning Board members said they
agreed SGB was too political and focused
too much time on the Allocations process.

announced that their primary reason for

bowing out, however, boiled down to the
fact that “SGB is just ﬂat-out not a cool
thing to do anymore. Deucesf’

Kazour said Board members had under-
taken a “pretty big social risk in the fall by
running for election to a Board that no one
really wanted to be on,” referring to the

fact that only 10 students had competed ,

in the 2014 election for the eight board
member positions. ‘

“Now that 30 percent of our group has
tapped out, we thought it would be smart
to play damage control,” Kazour added.

Nites said that although the four mem-
bers hadn’t previously discussed with him
their intentions to resign,’ he’s optimistic
about the Board’s future.

“Good riddance,”Nites said, before call-
ing a motion to adjourn and shouting, “I’m
not afraid of you” to media representatives.

Posvar Hall escalators repaired, new floors discovered

Richard Koppenaal ‘
H arrz'son’s Roommate

Since the building’s opening in 1978,
Posvar Hall has been one of, if not the

biggest, buildinglon Pitt’s campus. And:

accompanying this title of sorts were

_ generations of Pitt students asking,

“What is that building used for?”
Thisweek, the building’s purpose
became slightly less mysterious.

After, several hours of searching, the
building’s custodial staff conﬁrmed the
discovery of a fourth and fifth floor in

' the building.” ‘-

These discoveries were spurred from
the ‘sudden activation of the building’s

Coming for Jolm’s Crown

When director Gabriele Muccino began
ﬁlming his new movie “Fathers and Daugh-
ters” on the University of Pittsburgh’s cam-
pus, hemight have expected throngs of
youngfans to swarm the set.

But Muccino probably didn’t expect to’

recast one of his young stars.

On Monday, the director revealed that
his ﬁlm, which once starred “Breaking Bad”
star Aaron Paul, Amanda Seyfried and Rus-
sell Crowe, will be recasting the Seyfried
role for Screaming Aaron Paul Fan.

He ﬁrst noticed her while they were
shooting last Thursday outside the Carn-
egie Library, when tens of thousands of fans
gathered across the street from the set.

After ﬁnishing a scene, Paul invited the
mob of fans to run over to him. The crowd
sprinted, jumped and howled for Paul. But
one fan made a lasting impression on Muc-

cino like no other.
i j “When I ﬁrst saw Screaming Aaron Paul
Fan, she just had this contagious energy,”

Muccino said.“‘You could tell she just want-.

edto stand next to Aaron and photograph
herself all day long. That’s when I knew she
was perfect for the role.” l

The “contagious energy” that Muccino
noted was most likely describing her con-
tinuous screaming from the moment she
saw Paul. .

“Once Aaron Paul walked over to us,
Screaming Aaron Paul Fan began to scream
for as long as her body would allow,” said
Somber Russell Crowe Fan. “She would
sometimes break the shrillnoise to utter
a c_ommon’]esse Pinkman catchphrase like
‘yeah, b*tch,’ ‘Gatorade me, b*tch’ or ‘this
is my own private domicile, and.I will not
be harassed, b*tch!’” gs

But Screaming Aaron Paul Fan attri-
butes her success to a whole other set of

physical qualities.

. Screaming Aaron Paul Fan said that she
loved Aaron Paul so much that she told
herself that she would “kick, punch, body
slam and generally manhandle at least 20
other girls to getclose to him.”

Area hospitalshave estimated that 10
to about 40 fans have been hospitalized
as a result of Screaming Aaron Paul Fan.

When asked about the f'an’s volatile
physicality, Muccino was hesitant to ex-
press his concerns.

“She’s a ﬁrecracker for sure, but we have
developed a new ﬁlming strategy where _

Aaron and Screaming Aaron Paul Fan will?‘

never share the screen with other actors,”
Muccino said.

While extensive rewrites would nor-
mally be required for situations like this,
Muccino and screenwriter Brad Desch are

_taking a more improvisational approach to

ﬁnishing the ﬁlm.

Screaming AaronPauI fan to star alongside.Aaron Paul in flick

“Instead of changing entire scenes in
which Aaron and Amanda’s characters
would have interacted with other cast

members, we’ve decided to let Aaron try '

some more off-the-cuff dialogue, with
Screaming Aaron Paul Fan screaming re-
sponses of varying volume and timbre,”
Muccino said.

He noted that the changes could result
in some delays, much like that other movie
ﬁlmed in Pittsburgh. T

Screaming Aaron Paul Fan is extremely
excited for the opportunity to act alongside
her favorite actor of all time, but admits
that the demanding schedule might impact
her “Breaking Bad” binge schedule.

“I’m halfway into season two right now,
so I’ve already seen that one bald politician
guy get killed off. I still have a lot of the
show left, but at this point, I’m just waiting
for the main character to lose his stupid
southern accent,” she said. ﬂ

Students can’t stop, Won’t stop twerking for  at Bigelow Bash

Katie Our Lady
Technology Beat Reporter

For the first time since Kesha graced
the University. of Pittsburgh_with her
glittery presence in 2011, another A-
list female pop star will come in like a
wrecking ball at Bigelow Bash.

On the off chance that already-

booked Timeflies, a hip-hop and »

techno group, unexpectedly misses
its ﬂight and cannotshow up forits
performance, the Pitt Program Coun-
cil announced that it has scurried to
find a backup and was able to book
Miley Cyrus, a former actress on Dis-
ney Channel’s “Hannah Montana,” for
the event.

Students and administrators have

mixed feelings about the possibility of

this last-minute plan being necessary.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said
he is worried about the effect Cyrus’
performance might have on the stu-
dent body. '
_ “I saw her performance on the Video
Music Awards, and I have to say that

' now.

I don’t'think it’s a good idea for Pitt
students to be exposed to this twerking
nonsense,” Nordenberg said.‘

He also pointed out that many of
Cyrus’ songs showcase explicit c_on-
tenttthat could encourage binge alcohol
consumption and sexual promiscuity.

He indicated one track on Cyrus’
most recent album Bangerz entitled
“We Can’t Stop,” in'which Cyrus de-
scribes f‘red cups and sweaty bodies
everywhere,” and goes on tospeculate
that “somebody here might get some

Dean ofstudents Kathy Humphrey
disagreed. According to Dean Hum-
phrey, Pitt students are smart enough
not to take Cyrus’ lyrics seriously. She
also noted that Cy_rus_is a strong young
woman who can empower female Pitt
students with her success.

"Having Miley Cyrus perform will
give us the best of both worlds, and
we always want the world for our stu-
dents,” she said.

Gabrielle Riggs, a sophomore engi-
neering major, said she was concerned

about what the atmosphere might be

like at Cyrus’ performance because_of .

previous stunts the pop star has pulled.
“She smoked a joint on stage at
the MTV Europe Music Awards; 
thinks that’s acceptable, there’s no'tel;l.-
ing what she will do on a 'college"ca_,m-
pus. She can’t be tamed,” Riggs

“My friends and I would rather see
a cool band that nobodyknléwsvabout

said. ' , ,
Peyton James, a senior political
science major,» said‘ she thinks Cyrus’
performance could be relatable for Pitt
students, as Cyrus has recently transi-
tioned from child actress on a Disney

 
   

  

Channel show to a provocative pop star ,

teaming up with record producer Mike
Will Made It.’ i

“Miley is going through a transfor-
mation right now and t.rying to redeﬁne

  
 

herself,” James said, “Just like we’re
trying to .ﬁnd ourselves at college.”
She also said that almost all of Cyrus’
songs are upbeat and will encourage
students to dance and sing along.
“Bigelow Bash needs really fun acts
that will.‘keep the crowd moving, like

i. when Kesha came,” she said:

Alex Jacobs, a senior communica-
tions major, said, either way, he is

happy that his Bigelow Bash experi-

ence will end on a good note.

“I’m really excited at the possibility
of seeing Miley Cyrus, actually,”Jacobs
said, “She’s been so.popular over the

= last year and seeing her live would be

a deﬁning and memorable moment of
my last year at Pitt.”

Jacobs admitted that he might be-
come emotional if Cyrus came and
chose to play her more sentimental
songs during the performance. _

“I’m not going to lie. If she comes ‘

and plays any of her inspirational
songs, I will probably tear up thinking
about graduation. It’s really all about
the climb,” Jacobs said. .,I

Students’ weeks highlighted by seeing athletes

Stephen ‘Pepe’ Caruso '
The Freshman '

The highlight of sophomore economics
major Brett Quigley’s week was when he
saw sensational freshman wide receiver
Tyler Boyd enter his astronomy class.

“I mean, this is a pretty popular
gen-ed course, it would make sense for
him to be in it,” Quigley said, trying to
justify his growing excitement at the
prospect of being in the same room as
the rising playmaker.

In the excitement, though, Quigley
and other students shuffling into the
Alumni Hall auditorium missed the less-
than-prophetic entrances of decorated
Pitt senior wrestlers P.J. Tasser and
Tyler Wilps.

Quigley, clearly starstruck, said that
he continued to try to ﬁght for a better

line of sight as he attempted to assure
himself that he was indeed within 50
feet of the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl
champion up-and-comer. The other two
athletes, who ended their season as part
of a team ranked 10th in the country,
took seats right next to Quigley.
Junior Shirley Carpenter said that
she often tries to sit in an.aisle seat
to strengthen her chances of catching
football players as they leave class.

~When asked if she ever expands her

criteria to include other types of ath-

’ letes, she said she was perplexed by

the question.

“I’ve thought about baseball, but
they’re only really a spring-semester
thing,” Carpenter said.

‘ Quigley, a self-proclaimed “sports
fanatic,” said he began to develop a
slight sweat as he realized he still had

one empty seat next to him priorto the
lecture, which opened the opportunity
for Boyd to take the place. '

“Really, there had to have been like
10 open seats left,” Quigley said.

He quickly went through the odds
of havingthe star of next year’s pos-
sible seven-game-winning football team
next to him. Tasser, directly to his left,
calmly. placed his backpack under his
seat with his arms, arms that had helped
himlwin ACC Wrestler of the Week for
being a key player in Pitt’s stunning up’-
set of No. 5 Oklahoma State inJanuary.

“How great would it have been to
have [Boyd] sit nearme, and not these
over-muscled weirdos,” Quigley said.

Wilps, who managed to win All-
American honors by going 3-1 at the
NCAA wrestling championships in Okla-
homa City, said that be needed a pen to

take his notes, but couldn’t ﬁnd anyone
willing to help him out.

“Everyone was looking at Tyler
[Boyd], and I think James [Conner]
was by him, too,” Wilps said. “I’m still
not sure why they couldn’t unﬁx their
gazes to pass over a pen. I mean, I have
similar sweatsuits.”- .

Several students"faces became crest-
fallen as their excitement was quickly
dashed when they saw Boyd sit down in
a corner, next to two other young men
sporting backpacks emblazoned with
gold numbers.

But Quigley remained hopeful.

“I guess my best story is stillwhen I
sat two seats behind Joshua Ko on the
1oA,” he said. “And hey, those other
two guys who sat by me looked like they
could’ve been some linemen or backup
linebackers.” I

Michael Slackman was covering street

when a helicopter shot at him.
Slackman and a colleague ran across a
ﬁeld and crouched behind a wall for cover.

“We looked up‘ and there was this he- _

Suspecting they were being hunted,
Slackman and his colleague ﬂagged down
a passing vehicle to ﬁnd safety.

Slackman worked as a correspondent
in the Middle East for eight years until
2011. In this work, he viewed world events
from the ground up, a perspective dif-
ferent from that of many academics and
policymakers. A V l '

Now the deputy editor of the New York
Times, Slackman told several stories that
highlighted the chaotic nature of world
events when he spoke Monday night in
the William Pitt Union at an event jointly
sponsored by the Collegiate Readership
Program and the Pitt Student Govern-
ment Board. _

While Slackman was still a reporter,
he worked in Cairo, the Egyptian capi-

to illustrate the complicated dynamics
between the country’s religious groups.

According to Slackman, Cairo had one
of the best recycling systems in the world.

Student duo uses music to evoke lost memories

Stajj’ Wrz'ter

In a hospital unit for residents suffer-

ing from severe dementia, a piano sat
neglected in the activity room until one
elderly man remembered how to play.

“He sat down at that piano and started
to play, and I just remember being really
blown away and surprised at his capacity
to revive that skill,” saidjennifer Lingler,
who worked as a nurse in the unit for
dementia residents who developed be-
havioral problems at University Hospitals
of Cleveland.

Lingler, now the director of the Edu-
cation and Information Core for Pitt’s
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, was
most astonished because the resident
was-nearly nonverbal when he revived
his instrumental skills. V

Two Pittsburgh students founded a
nonproﬁt organization that has operated

for more than two years based on music’s
ability to help improve the quality of life
of residents with dementia. Maureen De-
ken, a sophomore majoring in Spanish at
Pitt, co—founded iPods for Alzheimer’s
with Serena Mani, a senior at the Ellis
School in Shadyside. The organization
collects and uses donations to purchase
iPods ﬁlled with individualized music
from the Alzheimer’s residents’ pasts,
after the duo meets with each resident to
determine music tastes. While Deken and
Mani are the only members of iPods for
Alzheimer’s at the moment, they said they
hope to expand the group to add more
volunteers as they continue to develop

their organization.“These residents can_

listen to music from their childhood and
songs from the past, and it helps them re-
connect with these memories,” Mani said.
T Deken and Mani work with ﬁve resi-
dents at Schenley Gardens Senior Living.

_ ‘As often as every other day, Deken and

Mani also visit some residents who are

’ unable to operate the music players by
themselves.

“There’s an entire ﬂoor of people who
have Alzheimer’s at Schenley Gardens,
and we want to have somebody be able
to go to all of them if we can,” Deken said.

The iPods for Alzheimer’s website has
generated funds from donors as far as
Texas, and Deken and Mani have also
raised funds by approaching neighbors
and family members. The cost to pur-
chase iPods and music for each resident
is about $30.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most com-
mon form of dementia, or mental deterio-
ration, characterized by the accumulation
of a protein called amyloid, the presence

of neuroﬁbrillary tangles and a loss of '

brain tissue.

LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

One of the primary functions of a news pub-
lication is to ensure that leaders in society
are held accountable, and this holds true
at both the professional and student levels.
From presidential elections to student-
government debates, editors of newspapers
such as The Pitt News seek to ensure readers
are armed with the knowledge they need to
serve as active members inea community. A
. Thus, when a newspaper’s editors make
mistakes — be they minor or large — they

are obligated to disclose them to their read- ‘

ership.

On March 26, The Pitt News published an
article entitled “Crisis at the Zoo: Students
question Pete seats,” which attempted to ex-
plain why the Oakland Zoo, the Pitt basket-
ball team’s student section, isn’t prominently
featured in television broadcasts of games.

Throughout the article, the reporter fea-
tured the comments of Greg Hotchkiss, the
men’s basketball team’s director of media re-
lations. Hotchkiss sought to provide insight
into the rationale behind the Athletic De-
partment’s decision to position the Oakland
Zoo on the same side of the court as the main

television cameras at the Petersen Events'

Center, thereby limiting the amount of time
the Zoo is featured in a game broadcast.
Unfortunately, the article misquoted
Hotchkiss on multiple occasions and por-
trayed him as overly critical of the Petersen

Events Center and the athletic department. V M

In the third. paragraph of the article, The

‘Pitt News ‘reported Hotchkiss said, “If I had

been here when they designed the Pete, I

would have told them not to do it this way.

The building was designed pretty poorly.”
Not only did Hotchkiss never refer to the

- building as “The Pete,” a colloquial name for

the Petersen Events Center, he also never
said the building was designed poorly. '
Though Hotchkiss did say the ﬁrst half
of the quote, it lacks context, considering
Hotchkiss_ told the reporter before that
the Oakland Zoo, created in 2001, was in
its infancy with a membership of only 50
students, making it a minor factor in the
building’s design. -

Hotchkiss also emphasized to the re- '

porter that the placement of luxury boxes on
the sideline opposite the Oakland Zoo is the

and that 95 percent of arenas in the United
States have the.same setup.

In the sixth paragraph, The Pitt News
reports that Hotchkiss “acknowledged that

ﬁxing the problem would come at _aHhuge'..
dexpense.’3.Hotchkiss ‘never considered the

positioning of the Oakland Zoo to be aprob-
lem, as it was described in the article. This,
therefore, is also inaccurate.

, In the following paragraph, Hotchkiss
is quoted as saying, “At the time they built
the Pete, there was no Oakland Zoo; also.”
This was a misquotation and, as previously
noted, students established the Oakland Zoo

in 2001, while the men’s basketball team.

still played home games at the.Fitzgerald
Field House. »

In the 10th paragraph of the story, The-

Pitt News reported the Fitzgerald Field
House seats about 4,000 people. This was
incorrect. Hotchkiss told the reporter it
seats 6,000.

Two paragraphs later, The Pitt News re-

But when panic broke out in 2009 over a
supposed swine ﬂu epidemic, the system
changed, and the government slaugh-
tered the roughly 300,000 pigs in Cairo.

‘fGuess what happened,” he said. “Now
they had huge mounds of rotting, fetid,
disgusting waste.”

He said that since the Arab Spring
revolution, the country has struggled
to find its identity, with citizens seeing

' themselves as members of religious or
ethnic groups rather than as Egyptian
citizens. ‘

But Egypt has changed in key ways,
even if its ride to democracy has come
in fits and starts — with the army oust-
ing the democratically elected Muslim
Brotherhood last year -— the country is
no longer under authoritarian regimes.

Slackman stressed he did not offer
prescriptions for speciﬁc foreign poli-
cies, but said President Barack Obama’s

response to events in the Middle East_

has been unclear.

if???

Obama has largely responded to
events such as the military coup that
ousted Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim
Brotherhood-backed president last year,
with ambivalence.

“We appreciate the complexity of the
situation,” Obama said in alstatement last
year. “While Mohamed Morsi was elected
president in a democratic election, his
government was not inclusive and did
not respect the views of all Egyptians.
We know that many Egyptians, millions
of Egyptians, perhaps even a majority
of Egyptians were calling for _a change
in course.”

Slackman said he wanted to see more
clarity from the Obama administration
in its response to Egypt and other hot
zones, such as Syria.

But he said Egypt has changed in key
ways since the Arab Spring. A single
leader no longer makes unilateral deci-
sions without worrying about its people’s
wishes. '

“Egypt is not what is was before,”
Slackman said. “Everything is different.
The street is now a force.”

current events feels familiar to Slackman.

Though U.S. Marines fought hard to
“liberate” the insurgent stronghold of
Fallujah during the U.S.—led occupation
of Iraq, ﬁghters sympathetic to al-Qaeda
have retaken the city since the coalition
forces’ withdrawal. More than a decade
after the U.S.—led invasion of Afghanistan

~ toppled the Taliban’s regime, NATO and

Afghan—government forcesare still strug-
glingto stop attacks in the country.

In East Asia, events that took place
more than 70 years ago while the Korean
peninsula was part of the the Japanese
Empire such as the existence of “comfort
women” — Korean women who were
forced into sex slavery for the Japanese
army — continues to strain relations
between South Korea and Japan.

“It seems in a lot of ways like we’re
moving back in time,” Slackman said.

SGB President Mike Nites said this
was not a new idea.

“Everyone throws the phrase, ‘His-
tory repeats itself,’ around all the time,”
Nites said. “But he presented in a way
that really made me think about what
he was saying.” I

Feminism requires open-mindedness on both ends of spectrum

Sophia Al Rasheeld
Columnist

I grew up in a- small town — one of those
secretly racist for no apparent reason, refuse
to change the traditional way of thinking, we-
won’t-leave—this-place—until—we-die-because-
we-run—this-town kind of places. Needless to
say, Iﬁnd myselfholding my tongue whenever,
I return home — it’s easier than getting into
an ideological debate every ﬁve minutes.

' Constantly hearing the townies make fun
of girls in bars wearing oversized, made-in-
the—USA sweaters (similar to the ones that I,
leave in my Pittsburgh closet over breaks),
exude little knowledge about what is hap-
pening more than two counties away and
preoccupy themselves with the fascination of
simply getting through life to have kids‘ and
raise a family has sadly taught me it is much
easier to keep quiet about my strong opinions.

A particularly funny moment occurred
over one of my last breaks at home, during

PINIONS

which I was referred to as_a feminist.
I My initial thought was “Oof, I’rn so glad

, no actual feminists from school heard tha ”

Sure, I’ve enrolled in some.women’s studies
classes over the pastfew-semesters —— learn-
ing about the male gaze, envy of a certain’
organ, the hilarious ways that philosophers
differentiated men from women (the ancient
ones basically thought that our possession
of wombs should keep us inside) — but I’m
deﬁnitely no "expert on the subject. Hear-
ing that description automatically made me
self-conscious, and not for the reason you

' maythink.

I was sure there is someone much more
familiar with feminism that would point out
a factor — something about how relatively
traditionallam orthatlown afewyogapants
from Victoria’s Secret ——- that would automati-
cally strip me from my rights to be a feminist.
I like certain men, hate others. I like certain
women, yet hate others. I saw the Disney
movie “Frozen,” and I was incredibly happy

that the resolution of the conﬂict had nothing
to do withaprince. Butthe harsh attitude that
surrounds the word feminist prevented me
from ever'formally adopting the title. _
The more I thought about it, the more I
realized that there really shouldn’t be a set
guideline to considering oneselfa feminist.
While the expertise of the subject is certainly
valuable and a vehicle by which we can fur-
ther develop theoriesand place them into
action, it would be a bit hypocritical to the
progress-seeking agenda to limit the title to
a group with very distinct ideals. If we hope
to remove a primitive stigma of the role of
-a woman in society, whether this be in her
familial stance, her independence, her place—
ment.into the workforce or her subjection to
patriarchy, shouldn’t this simple desire and
acknowledgement be enough?
Furthermore, as a female growing up in
the 21st century, where the media explodes
withwomen representingattemptingto bring
different approaches to their stance in the

world, it becomes impossible to poinpoint a
distinct authority figure on the subject— one
that _could adequately reach the mainstream
with the broad perspective that the subject
demands, and this only ﬁirthers the need
to accept individualistic understandings of
feminism. _ ’ i .

For example, Beyoncé, while being hailed
as afeminist overall (from herfantastic work
on the album “4” to her early Destiny’s Child

‘ days) doesn’t exactly make the cut in repre-
senting an ideal feminist in her most recent
album. _

Lyrics vividly describing “limousine
sex,” as the Rolling Stone review accurately
stated, and revolving around a relationship,
no matter how much authority she has in the
relationship or how strong she is, act as yet
another failure to depart from the male con-
ception of a woman ——- that is, her equaliza-

tion as an asset to her existence in the music/
media world. Lady Gaga, who is also closely
associated with feminism, also comes with
complications of inconsistencies.

The passion in hervoice as she sings about
her desire to depart from the approval of an
authority ﬁgure in songs such as “scheilse”
and “Telephone” exude the frustration of
many women held back by feminism. How-

ever, her words describing the topic in inter-
views generated far less applause.

And in terms ofTV representation, I can’t ,

seem to ﬁnd an actress-writer that perfectly
ﬁts what I ﬁnd a feminist to represent either;
I could barely go through an episode of “The
Mindy Project” or “Girls” without hearing
either Mindy Kaling or Lena Dunham men-
tion how proud they are of their weight — as
if it’s necessary for a woman to explain that
she’s proud of her ﬁgure to prove that she’s a
stable person or that a good ﬁgure isthe result
of pleasing men. Oh, and the fact that both

of those prominent ﬁgures still rely on men
as vital catalysts to their plotlines makes me
wonder if they’re actually voicing anything
that young female minds should hear.

These ﬁgures, while certainly presenting
something that departs from the former way
of thinking, all exemplify, in at least one way,
the imperfection that comes with the hefty
duty of representing feminism.

What these ﬁgures have done in an ap
plaudable way, however, is help to bring differ-
ent feminist ideals into themainstream (CNN

nicely statedthis in a recent article celebrating

Gloria Steinem’s birthday). From the release
ofthe previously mentioned ﬁlm, “Frozen,” to
the lighthearted integration of comedy (Louis
C.K.’s opening monologue from the last Sat-
urday Night Live episode was wonderful), the
fact that the word is slowly losing the cloud of
antagonism around it gives us hope that we’ll
approach discussion of this complex ideology
with, well, less antagonism. '

If we expect others to have the open-
mindednessvthat feminism requires, feminists
should be open-minded, as well.

‘THE SECRET LIFE or ROBOT

a

John Lavanga
A€9’E Editor

From looking around at the myriad
sculptures currently on display at
SPACE Gallery Downtown, a casual
onlooker might assume that artist

Toby Atticus Fraley harbors a deep‘

love of robots.
That sentiment couldn’t be further

from the truth. Fraley, 36, has been
making foundiobject robots for nearly

’ a decade, but isn’t much ofa “robot afi-

cionado,” as he put it. Instead, he sees
his artforms as a means to an end —— a
way to create a ﬁgure that is just hu-
man enough to be relatable but strange
enough to be intriguing to a casual
observer. His latest exhibit, titled “The
Secret Life of Robots,” exemplifies this

aspect of Fraley’s work.

The show is a series of domestic

scenes’ depicting the mundanity of

everyday life. In it, viewers will find’

robots vacuuming dirty floors, sleep-
ing on couches and dealing with other
trivial issues that befall most of us.
Fraley emphasized that though this
visually arrestingjuxtaposition of the
drblly human and the intriguingly ro-

s’ SHOWS, ROBOTS’ HUMAN sum-:

botic is the focal point of the project,

its goal is to bring attention to the

overlooked moments in our lives..
“The [robot] passed out on the

couch-, I don’t think people would

expect something like that to be in a
show,” Fraley said. .

‘MGS: Ground Zeroes’ tweaks stealth formula toyvarying success -

“Metal Gear Solid_: Ground Zeroes”
Grade: B- _
Developer: Koiima‘Productions

Enter Big Boss: an American super soldier
and former CIA agent tricked into killing
his mentor, The Boss, by the government
he faithfully served. The United States
denounced The Boss, but it was all part of

their ploy to prevent nuclear war with the.

Soviet Union. Disillusioned, Big ‘Boss left
the United States to establish Militaires

Making up one—half of the “Metal Gear

available on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,’
Xbox 360 and Xbox One and is the prequel
to the full title “Metal Gear Solid V: The
Phantom Pain,” which is in development
with a predicted 2015 release date.
Considerably different from previous

entries, “Ground Zeroes” implements so
many new game mechanics that it takes an

already superb game — which set genre-

deﬁning standards for voice acting, musi-
cal score and stealth action — and puts
it in a bigger, "more exciting world. Sadly,
there are no Metal Gears in this version,
though the threat of the mobile nuclear
tanks lingers through the subtext.
Nonlinear, confusing, absurd and re-
petitive plotlines characterize the series
as much as tactics, espionage and action

do, but together the two miraculously '
meld into one of the most beloved game ‘

franchises in PlayStation history. “Metal
Gear Solid” imbues nukes, technology,
surveillance and war with enough magic
and mysticism to create some really in-
sane plotlines and characters — such as

the unforgettable Psycho Mantis, who

G—Eazy tears through setlist at sold-out Altar Bar show

Sheldon Satenstein
Assistant Visual Editor

Dressed ‘in black from head to toe with his
signature slicked—back hair, rapper G—Eazy
put a local twist on the wardrobe that has
given him the nickname “The James Dean
of Hip—Hop” by donning a Pirates jersey
on top of his sharp attire. Born Gerald Earl
Gillufn in Oakland, Calif., the 24-year-old
G—Eazy wasn’t much older than most of the
sold-out crowd in the Altar Bar on Saturday
evening. . ‘

A neon sign with his name ﬂickered
on as G—Eazy took the stage and launched
into “Far Alone” alongside cheers from
the crowd that only got louder when he
followed up with the enormously popular
“Lady Killers.”

The majority of the night’s setlist was
derived from G—Eazy’s two most popular
projects, the sample—heavy mixtape The

Endless Summer and 2o12’s Must Be Nice. I

The juxtaposition of the two projects pro-
vided an insightful glimpse into G-Eazy’s
growth as an artist. Sampled tracks such
as f‘Endless Summer” and his breakout
single “Runaround Sue” —- sourced from
Dion’s chart-topping 1961 pop song of the
same name — riled up the crowd, but their
energy didn’t waver when he moved on
to performancesvof his own productions,

such as “Marilyn.” At numerous points . 4

throughout the show, the rapper accepted

. cell phones that were thrust his way, snap-

ping a quick selﬁe on stage before handing
thelphone back to its owner.‘

Not one for living in the past, the Bay.
Area native also teased his forthcoming

album, These Things Happen, playing -

several unreleased songs. Despite not yet
knowing the lyrics, the crowd didn’t pass
up the opportunity to continue showing

, their enthusiasm for G-Eazy’s new mate-

rial. The rapper also brought out several
of the opening acts —- Tory Lanezand
Maybach Music Group’s Rockie Fresh —
for an exclusive remix of his track “Been
On.” By the time black and white balloons
rained down from the rafters during “Al-
most Famous,” the shouts of theaudience

had escalated even further, but they didn’t A
peak until the show closed w_ith.a raucous .

rendition of “Loaded.”

As the beat gradually faded out, G—Eazy
bowed respectfully, illuminated only by
the neon sign adorned with his moniker
and the shouts of encouragement from
the audience. Before taking his leave, he
addressed the Pittsburgh audience one
last time, expressing his gratitude for their
support as he had already done numerous
times throughout his performance.

' ‘ Beforethe show, The Pitt News had to
opportunity to sit down with Gillum and"
discuss his own college experience, his
music and touring with Lil Wayne.

The Pitt News: You experienced some

, moderate success making music during

your teenage years and sharing it online
via sites such as Myspace. What made you
decide to go to college instead of breaking

. directly into the music industry?‘

Gerald Gillurn: Well, that’s what I want-
ed to do. I wanted to stay in Oakland, be

a rapper, but it was my mom who really _.

_ pushed me and said, “No, the hell you’re

not. You’re going to go to school and try
and get a degree. You have this window
right now.” I also had a really good schol-
arship to go to Loyola University in New
Orleans, and so my mom really put her foot
down and told me, “This is what you’re
doing.” Obviously, in retrospect, I’m very
appreciative of that. I think leaving home
and getting to live in another city, and
the whole college experience in general,
broadened my horizons and opened my
eyes to a lot of different stuff. _

' TPN: What advice can you give college
students that might ﬁnd'themselves in a
similar situation as you, pursuing a degree
in the arts instead of an ‘arguably more sta-,
ble ﬁeld such as business or engineering?

GG: Biggest thing I can say is hustle.
Go hard. Work every single day at get-

‘ ting your planeoffthe ground, because it

takes a long ti-me in the creative arts to get
something going. A lot of people kind of
feel like, ‘I’m going to wait through college
and then when I graduate I’ll ﬁgure out

what I’m going to do.’ No. You’ve got to get '

that ball rolling while you’re in school, so
when you graduate it’s already going. You
need to take advantage of the time you have
and work hard. 4

TPN: You’ve had the opportunity to
open for some big names in the past —

Lil Wayne, Drake, Snoop Dogg — what '-

impact did you feel like those experiences
had on you? * .

GG: I just get inspired every ‘time I
watch them perform. Itry to learn every-
thing I can. Everything from a Lil Wayne,
to a'T.I., to a Snoop, to a Drake, these are

A ' people that have done it for a. long time at

a very high level, and you don’t get there
by accident. You get _there by being really
f*cking good at whatever_you do. There’s
always something you can learn from them.

TPN: Listening to your music, there’s a
notable difference inproduction between
your mixtape The Endless Summer and
your most recent release, Must Be Nice.
Was it a conscious choice on your part

to move away from the brand of sample— _

heavy rap?
GG:" Yeah. It’s totally fun sampling

‘ stuff and taking a song from one world

and bringing it to a completely different
world, and I think there’s_ something re-
ally dope in-that‘ juxtaposition there. But

police or whomever. Someone.

Woods closed out with his new sin-
gle, “30 Deep,” and together with his DJ,
GQ, got the whole venue to reverberate
with the song’s huge, booming bass.
Smoke machines filled the stage with
an eerie fo'g, emphasizing the set’s end
with practical effects.

Conversely, Ty Dolla $ign strolled ‘

leisurely onto the stage when his turn
came. Dressed rather anonymously with

a bucket hat, shades and a. Portland.

Trail Blazers jacket, he was content to
let his music do the talking rather than
his energy. Ty Dolla $ign was instantly
differentiable from his opener in that he
carried an effortlessness into all of his
raps, rhymes and motions. He lacked
a lot of the agg'ression,‘but countered
it with unvarnished singing, gravelly
tones and also a reverence for the party
lifestyle‘.

Like Woods, Ty Dolla $ign paid
homage to his forebears. A snippet of
Snoop Lion and Wiz Khalifa’s “-Young,

Wm.’

Wild and Free” was juxtaposed between
two tracks, and the opening lines of R.
Kelly’s “Bump N’ Grind” set the right
mood as Ty Dolla $ign leapt down into
the crowd and scrutinized the audience
for the proper lady to sing his next song
to. He demanded the lights be dropped,
and so the only luminescence came from
red backlighting that channeled an ap-
propriately romantic atmosphere.

Before Ty Dolla $ign finished the
show, he removed himself from the
stage and reappeared in an Andrew
McCutchen jersey, to some notable re-
action from the crowd. He then called
his crew back up, including Woods,’.and
picked some women out of the audience
to join him for his last song. At first,
there were about a dozen — but halfway
through “Paranoid~[Remix],” he ges-
ticulated for more, and approximately
50 Pitt studerits boogied alongside the
artist.

. Despite the misfortune of headlin-
ing act Tyga missing the show, the re-
sponsive, arm-flailing, dancing crowd
seemed to enjoy his replacement and

- Ty Dolla $ign’s epic dance-club beats.

ultimately, back to what I was just talking
about with getting my plane off the ground
by the time I ﬁnished school — you’ve got
to make money. You’ve got to pay your rent.
When I was doing the sampling stuff, it was
all free music because you can’t sell that. I
didn’t have the money to clear the samples
so we gave all the music away for free‘ and
hoped we didn’t get sued. It’s fun to sample
and remix stuff, but I knew I needed to
be able to make songs from scratch and
make original music so that I could own
it and sell it.

TPN: How does your forthcoming al-
bum, These Things Happen, demonstrate
that growth?

GG: Oh man. If you thought there was

a step between The Endless Summer and

Must Be Nice, this is like a quantum leap,
‘but that’s where we set the bar. I knew
_I couldn’t get by just releasing the same
album again, and we had to set the bar
higher to really break through. I’m really
excited about this one. This is on a whole
other level. I can’t wait to put it out.

TPN: As you approach the end of the
These Things Happen tour, what do you
think you’ll remember most fondly about
the experience?

GG: The New _York f*cking Times man.
The Times reviewed my show in New York
on the front page of the Arts section, and
that’s been the biggest moment —— ever.
My mom called me crying. She reads the
Times every day. The magnitude of the
Times writing a good review of your show
is ‘insane.

TPN: It’s clear that you’re having a lot
of success right now, but sometimes com-
placency can set in when that happens.
What doyou plan on doing to keep yourself
motivated to improve your craft?

GG: My whole team, we’re all really hard
on each other. It’s almost like a football
coach type of mentality. We all really enjoy
what’s going on right now, and we celebrate
and enjoy that, but at the same time we
push each other to be great and challenge
each other. It’s all about the process, re-
ﬁning everything and the attitude to not
be complacent. Keeping desire to always
want to work hard and deliver something
that matters. I ‘

ing over yard sales and antique shows
in order to find thewperfect materials

“I like using vintage, just kind of

A Americana stuff. The style was better,

Despite all of the workgthat goes

avoid making the “found” aspect of his

“I want them to see the piece first

This isn’t the.first time Fraley has
used his found—object robots to chal-
lenge the city of Pittsburgh. His first
public art piece, “Fraley’s Robot Re-
pair,” was a smashing success after
opening Downtown last year and took

“I was really shocked when my robot

based on something that nobody really

needed,” he said.

Both of these exhibits are built upon

outlandish creation to make overlooked

Although it might not sport the intensity
of the Backyard Brawls of days past, the
Pittsburgh Panthers baseball team’s non-

conference matchup against the West"

Virginia Mountaineers Tuesday evening
isnonetheless a key contest for the surg-
ing Panthers squad.

Pitt, coming off a three-game sweep
against No. 23 Georgia Tech last -week-
end, has won seven of its past eight
games and looked much more comfort-
able after a sub-.500 start to the Pan-
thers’ first season as members_ of the
ACC. A i
V Outﬁelder Boo Vazquez thinks that
the recent string of success has a lot to
do with everything falling into place at
the right time. i . '

“I just think we’ve been putting ev- ’
« erything together,” said Vazquez. “We’re

hitting and pitching'well at the same
time, while before we were doing one
or the other, but not both.”

Pitt head coach Joe Jordano said he
has also been pleased with the team’s
play of late, and he would like to see the
team continue on as they have’ begun,

for improvement.
“We have been executing verywell,”

he said. “We are minimizing mistakes
and playing solid baseball. I’m not sure
if we’ve'gelled yet as a team; but we are

 ‘Panthersseek revenge against Mountaiineers

doingthings that are putting us in a posi-
tion to win games.” i

Despite the recent string of success,
the Panthers need to be at their best
Tuesday night, because Pitt’s only .1055
in its last eight games came at the hands
of West Virginia, who defeated the Pan-
thers 6-3 on March 25.

According to Vazquez, who leads the
team with five home runs and 32 runs
batted in, the Panthers are still looking
for some vengeance, despite trying to
send that loss out of sight and out of
mind. " .

“I think we did a good job'of putting
that lossbehind us before the Georgia
Tech series,” said Vazquez, a junior out
of Youngstown, Ohio. “But now, we re-

member the sting we felt losing to them. ‘

It’s deﬁnitely some added motivation.”

That loss, in which the Panthers fell
to West Virginia by a score of 6-3, fea-

The Pitt softball team wraps up its ﬁve- '

game homestand ‘Tuesday night with a
doubleheader against city rival Robert
Morris. The Panthers are coming off a
weekend sweep of ACC opponent Virginia
that gave the Panthers their ﬁrst-ever wins
in their new conference. . _ '
Thanks to her big weekend, inﬁelder
Maggie Sevilla was named the ACC Softball
Player of the Week. ' ‘
' “We’re really excited about what we are
doing here,” Sevilla said.

First pitch for game one against Robert

Morris (14-14, 0-1 N EC)is set to be thrown

at 3’_p,m. with the second matchup follow-

~ ing right away at 5 p.m.

‘ The Panthers’ (11-14, 3-5 ACC) sweep

‘ of ACC opponent Virginia comes at a great
time for the team. Prior to the weekend
series, Pitt was forced to cancel its last .

four home games. 4 _,

Despite the weather-related issues the
team has faced, Pitt came out swinging last
weekend. Against Virginia, the Panthers
outscored the Cavaliers 26-12.

In the ﬁrst game, Pitt hit four home
runs against Virginia’s pitchers on its way
to a 10-2 win. Three of those four home
runs were two-run shots.

On “top of those three two-run hom-
ers by Sevilla, Katherine Kramer and Tori
Nirschl,“ Carissa Throckmorton also hit a

so1o_shot.

After the top of the ﬁrst, Pitt had fallen
behind 2-0 before the Panthers’ bats came
alive as they went on to score 10 runs on
10 hits. Nirschl went 2-2 in game one, re-
cordingtwo RBIs and scoring three times,
while Maggie Sevilla went 2-3, scoring two
runs and hitting two RBIs.

Nirschl and Sevilla continued to be
successful at the platein game two as the
Panthers won 9-4. Nirschl added two_ more
hits and three RBIs. Sevilla went 3-4 in
game two" and drove in three more runs.

Along with Nirschl and Sevilla, Jordan

Fannin produced for the Panthers. The

three players, batting in the top three slots .

of the team’s batting order, tallied seven
hits, six RBIs and ﬁve runs.

Nirschl said her team did an “awesome
job” at the plate over the weekend.

“In both games, we got behind a little
in the ﬁrst inning, but we did a great job
of brushing it off and allowing ourselves
to do whatwe know how to do.”

In the series ﬁnale, Pitt showed it could
also come back when the Panthers needed
a late rally. _

The past, present and future coalesced on
a sunny Monday afternoon at PNC Park.
Jim Leyland, Barry Bonds, Dick Groat and
Jack Wilson stood mingled between Clint
Hurdle, Andrew McCutchen, Pedro Alva-
rez and Francisco Liriano as former Pirates

helped to present current players with the

awards they won a season ago.

For Hurdle, it was the National League
Manager of the Year. For Alvarez, it was a Sil-
ver Slugger. For Liriano, it was the National
League Comeback Player of the Year. Last,
but most importantly of all, McCutchen re-
ceived a Silver Slugger and his 2013 National
League Most Valuable Player trophy.

It was an important; day. ' _ 7

From Leyland emphatically claiming
that Bondsbelonged in the Hall of. Fame

A to Bonds asserting that he “got to play for a

great manager and a great city” to Wilson re-
calling the first time he and Freddy Sanchez
saw McCutchen play in a pre—draft tryout,

to Wilkinsburg, Pa.,-native Groat telling the
assembled media that he was “home,” it was
an important day. -

At the present, the Pirates have begun
a new season that will tell a new story. A

story that Hurdle and the Pirates hope will

have a different ending from that of 2013’s
tale, with the St. Louis Cardinals dispatching

Pittsburgh from the playoffs in the National A

League Divisional Series.‘
“We’re viewing ourselves as still chasing,”

Hurdle said. “There’s one team that took»

home the trophy last year, we were one of
eight to get to the dance. We want to play lon-
ger, so we’ve still got more to accomplish.”

As a result, he and the organization are
aware of heightened expectations from both
inside and outside the walls of the clubhouse.
And that’s a good-thing, Hurdle said as he
listed winning the Central Division and the
World Series as goals that come as a part of
those higher expectations.

Hurdle said multiple times last year that
a challenge for these Pirates, and anyone,

really, was not only attaining success, but
maintaining it. Monday morning, Hurdle
introduced a new element to the formula
— excellence. . if
“We’re looking for excellence, not suc-
cess, because success is comparing yourself
to somebody else,” Hurdle said. “Excellence

is being the best you can be, and that’s what_ '

we’re looking to do this year, to be the best
team that we can be. And we feel conﬁdent
that if that is accomplished, everything’s
going to end up really, really‘ good for ev-
erybody.”  " p '  '

Monday’s game ended up good for the
Pirates, and that’s a start. _ g L

The afternoon was capped in. the.1oth
inning when Neil Walker —— from Gibso-
nia, Pa., and a two—sport standout at Pine-
Richland High School —— stepped to the plate
against Carlos Villanueva. When Chicago’s
reliever leﬁ: a changeup elevated in Wa]ker’s
wheelhouse, he smacked it over the Clem-
ente Wall for Pittsburgh’s ﬁrst win of the
season. . '

I’ one for Pirates players, alumni

With his Pittsburgh connection, many
wanted to know after the game if it was spe-
cial for the Pittsburgh kid to hit a walk—ofl'
home run on Opening Day. ’ .

“I think I’ve become numb to that over
the past 11 seasons in this organization,”
Walker said. “But at the same time, special
moments like today, being a part of the pre-
game like that, having a game ﬁnish like that,
is very, very special. I certainly have a little
bit better understanding of the tradition of
this organization, I think, than most guys.”

With that understanding in tow, Pitts-
burgh’s second baseman recognized that
his ﬁrst-ever walk—off hit was a small part
of a much bigger day.

“This was a really special day for this
team, this organization, we’ve come a long
way,” Walker said. “The last 20 years have
been a tough thing, and to get to where we
are now over the last couple years is pretty
amazing.” '

on top of hitting well as of late, Pitt’s pitch-
ers have been dominant on the mound.
Minus a few ﬁrst-inning hiccups, the Pan-
thers’ pitching staﬁ' has performed well.

In game one of the Virginia series,
Savannah King (6-10) cruised «to a win.
Through ﬁve innings, King surrendered
four hits while striking out two and walk-
ing two batters. . '

p Alexa Larkin got the start in game two
and pitched a complete game for the Pan-
thers. Larkin recorded seven strikeouts
while giving up ﬁve hits and one earned
run. 1

Larkin came into relieve King in game
three and secured herself her ﬁfth win of
the season." In 2 2/3 innings, Larkin gave
up. two hits while striking out ﬁve.

While Pitt is riding a three—game win
streak, the Colonials are looking to halt
a short losing skid in its tracks. Robert
Morris has lost its last four matchups and
was shut out in two of those losses.

In that stretch, the Colonials have been
outscored.11-2. Their last game was a 5-0

feel a need for a shift in approach.

“I’m really just looking to do the same
thing I did,” Zeuch said. “Maybe a few
more fastballs earlier, but overall, more
of the same.”

Despite going in with the same mind-
set, Zeuch understands the importance
of the contest. _ ‘

“This game is huge for us,” said the
righty, currently 1-2 with a 1.98 ERA on

the season. “Not only in order to.keep
the momentum going, but also because a
win over West Virginia is always a strong
win.”

But Jordano was quick to downplay
the intensity of the rivalry game.

“It is always a competitive game with

the Mountaineers,”_]ordano, currently in .

his 17th year as the Panthers’ manager,
said. “Coaches on both sides respect
each other and will compete hard, but
at the end of the day, it’s just another
opportunity to play ball. I don’t believe

we ever had the same sense of rivalry

with [West Virgini,a]Vas in basketball or

football.” . ' ' _
The game against the Mountaineers is

i just a one-game matchup, and the con—'
_ test begins at 6 p.m. Tuesday evening at

Charles L.Cosl; Field. As previously men-
tioned, Zeuchwill be on the mound for
the Panthers, whereas the Mountaineers’
starting pitcher is yet to be announced.
The matchup is a precursor for Pitt to the

huge upcoming weekend series against

the No. 1 Virginia Cavaliers. I

Even Hurdle, the man who focuses always
on the game his team is playing that day
while remaining cognizant that there will
always be another game, allowed that there
was signiﬁcance to the events on the North

“lint mindful of reminding the guys that l a

Students rave over new burgerless burger at -Market Central

Fergie—Ferg
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

. The line stretches through Market Cen-

tral from Tutto Fresco to the door. Veg-
ans and meat eaters alike cannot get
enough of the chef’s newest creation:

' ~ the burgerless burger.

After many months of meetings with
dissatisfied vegan diners, Sodexo staff
knew something needed to be changed.
The answer was the burgerless burger, a
vegan and gluten-free rice bun ﬂavored
with black pepper and applewood liquid
smoke to make what sophomore Aman-

da Walle calls a “truly divine creation.”
While diners can decorate the burger- '

less burger with veggie toppings of their
choice, Chef Tim, the gluten—free mogul
of Market, said most students have been

eating just the bun.

Mikejohns, a junior math major, ad-
heres to a vegan diet and raved about
the new offering.

“The texture is a whole new dynamic.
And the taste is just —~ you bite into
it, and whaml It’s a ﬂavor explosion. I
can taste red pepper ﬂakes, cumin and
smoky goodness,’-’Johns said.

The burgerless burger has been so

popular that many students have forgot- .

ten that they would usually eat a_ chicken
patty every day. 4

For freshman Emalee Bak, the burger-
less burger has become her staple.

“I usually ate a chicken or a turkey
sandwich at Market every day. But now
my life has been utterly changed. The
burgerless burger is a revolution that
has brought better conditions to the

tastebuds of Pitt students everywhere,”
Bak said. _ '

Sodexo staff members were con-
cerned that the new offering might fail,
similar to the tofu crab cake dinner that
the dining service had pushed for in
the past. But expectations have been
met and surpassed with the burgerless
burger.

The kitchen team specially formu-

- lated a bun for the burger, and they have

had trouble keeping enough in stock.
The minute employees place a plate of
burger under the hot light, another hun-
gry student from the line of burgerless
burger devotees snatches it up.

Longtime vegan and sophomore
rehabilitation science major Tammy
Wilkins praised the chefs for this boon
to vegan diners everywhere. '

 

“Finally, there is something incred-
ible in Market for me to eat. The burger-
less burger —— with or without toppings
— is a ﬂavor explosion. The fact that
it’s gluten free is a plus, too. I’m thrilled

that Sodexo has heard the vegetarian '

community and answered perfectly,”
Wilkins said. _

Wilkins also described how she pre-
fers her burgerless burger.

“I love it with tons of greens, alfalfa,
spinach, lettuce and some radishes. Top
it off with mustard, and it’s a world unto
itself,” she added.

Sodexo noted that it hopes to ex-
pand this offering to other dining areas
across campus. There is also hope for
a location—speciﬁc beeﬂess beef taco

  Natural Lighta dark horsetinﬁthe beer pantheon

Jackson Crowder
gNatty Daddy .
We live in a golden age of American-
beer. With brews"'such”as~Budweiser,
Coors, Pabst Blue Ribbon and even Iron
City lining shelves, craftbé.er'consum-
ers are spoiled for choice. Making the
right drinking-choice can be difficult

‘ but, fortunately, one beer ‘stands above
" all‘ others‘ in today’s crowdedmarket.
_ I speak, dfcourse, of the venerable

Natura,l_:Light‘. _ . g L
.“Natl:y” as craft beer enthusiasts
affectionately call it, is the latest in a

long lirreiof top-shelf offerings from-

Anheuser-Busch, one of America’s most
respected craft breweries. Because of
its popularity in craft—brew circles, Nat-
ty can be a tough‘beer toltrack down.
As connected .as_..I.am,in_.the world of

‘microbreweries, I had to hitchhike all .

the way to a West Virginia gas station to

get my hands on some. The adventure‘

‘was well worth it.

A Natty comes primarily in attractive
silver cans, bound together in packs of
sixby artisanal Chinese plastic. Bottles
are available, too, but let’s be realistic
— neither you nor I have that kind of
cash lying around. My six pack, taken
directly from the gas-station fridge and
paid for with a crumpled $10 bill is

,_ cold — colder even than Coors, which

previously was the coldest beer I’d yet
come across. It’s so cold, in fact, that
my hands burn slightly upon touching
the sleek metal cans. It hurts, but just
as with Dogf1sh'Head 120 Minute IPA,
the best beers can be a little abusive.
Now, there are three ways to drink
Natty, all of which will make the most

of its ﬂavor. You can sip it slowly from
a plastic cup, preferably a red one. You
can shotgun it, but I find that move a
bit ostentatious and like to reserve it
for special occasions such as dinner
with my grandparents. The third op-

tion is to simply drink it straight from ,

the can. As I spent all my money on the
beer and have none left for red plastic
cups, I elect to go with the can.

Sitting on the shoulder of the high-
way, I crack the ﬁrst can and take a
deep whiff. Beautiful notes of vinegar
and hay hit my nose, followed by an
intriguing emptiness that prompts me
totake a sip.

Gulping deeply, the coldness brewed
masterfully into the beer hurts my teeth
but-can’t hide the delightfully watered-
down ﬂavor that beer lovers have been
raving over. Notes of grain and boiled

corn linger in the background, hiding
any trace of alcohol that could have
otherwise been found. Just as the ﬂavor
hits me, it suddenly vanishes, leaving
me, if nothing else, a bit more hydrated
than I was before.

Overall, Natty’s general lack of ﬂavor
makes it the perfect beer for literally
any situation, particularly one in which
you’d rather have water but want alco-
hol instead. Try sipping on this joyful
beer while going for a run or with lunch
at work. I can almost promise that you

won’t be disappointed. Additionally, V

Natty is the perfect beer to wow your
snobby, pretentious beer—need friends
at your next get together. just bring out
a six pack of this fine lager and watch
their faces fall with the realization that
they can’t possibly hang with your beer
skills. I

The aftermath of a legendary house party

* features sticky ﬂoors strewn with dis-

carded red Solo cups and crushed beer
cans. This scene might elicit a sense of
pride in the prior night’s events for some
students, but environmentally minded
students on Pit-t’s campus feel differently.

Over the last year, environmental clubs
at Pitt have started encouraging students
to consider their carbon footprint with
initiatives such as Bring Your Own Bag,
which sets a maximum free—bag quota at
campus dining facilities.

These activists have also stepped onto
the party scene with a campaign to reduce
the number of red Solo cups students use
each semester. The concerned students
launched Bring Your Own Cup (BYOC), a
new initiative that limits the number of
red Solo cups each student uses over the
course of a semester.

There are many adjectives that describe
college students —— idealistic, liberal,
sex-crazed —— but the most accurate
would probably be “poor.” Thanks_to
the rising prices of tuition, textbooks
and everything else college—related,
student loans are also on the rise.

Mix penniless students, lifelong .

home owners defaulting on their loans

Pots and Daisy Smith began the group af-

to live at home and play video games
when you have no video games to play
because the government took them as

' collateral. Providing collateral is_sup-

posed to motivate students to be fi-
nancially successful and independent.

The act details that smaller valuables

the government perceives your item to j

The new paperwork will be included in

Government officials have trumpet-

because, let’s be honest: We don’.t have a

tional 50 cents per cup at the door for
the remainder of the semester. Students
can also buy a ceramic cup that emits the
same style and cool factor as a standard
red Solo cup.

“Just think about how many cups

' you’ve used in the last semester. If we

could just cut this number in half, it would
be a huge step, but eliminating this prob-
lem entirely would be ideal,” she said. -
Smith suggested thatstudents nurture
one cup throughout the semester and
carry this single cup from party to party.
Alongwith the club’s initiative to re-

duce Solo cup usage, they’re also push-

» .ing for the use of kegs instead of canned
alcoholic beverages to cut down on the A

amount of aluminum disposed of on
campus. ’ '

“If students insist upon drinking from
cans, we urge them to have separate recy-
cling receptacles available to their guests
at parties,” Smith said. - V -

could save money by using only ﬁve cups
over the semester. A

friends or roommates and save your hosts
from buying multiple packages each time
they throw a social gathering,” she‘ said.

Blake Klein, a sophomore majoring

BYOC campaign is a logical step for Pitt’s

campus. I <
“I’m pretty sure Iwould lose or crush
more than ﬁve different cups before the
semester was over,” he said, “I don’t want
to pay extra at parties. I already have to
pay more because I’m a guy.” A
Rebecca Sample, a junior biology

major, said she’s worried that using the
same cup for an entire semester could
be unsanitary. '

“I’m concerned that my cup will get
moldy and I won’t be able to use it any-
more,” Jones said, “Those cups aren’t
made for multiple uses. They’re dispos-

“You c_an even use permanent markers to

In the future, they plan to team up with
Greek Life to sell monogrammed ceramic

red Solo cups personalized with the let- '

hopes this will make the campaign more
appealing to the student body. -

“People need to realize that being envi-

dents do to preserve our Earth, especially
South Oakland,” Granola said. “I think
that asking students’ to signiﬁcantly re-

Future invest

ment bankers

demand communal anarchy

Rohith Palli
Residerzt Satirist

A dedicatedgroup of Pitt business students, '

the Futuretlnvestment Bankers Brother-
hood of the University of Pittsburgh (FIBB-
UP), are proposing a constitutional change
that would place the United Statesat the
forefront of communal anarchies. "V
FlBB—UP is an up—and~coming student
organization generally devoted to fostering

‘ ' fellowship, spreading awareness o_foppor—

tunities in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance and enabling
its students to pursue careersas wealthy,
powerful bankers in a post-ﬁnancial ap_oca-
lyptic world. V '

l But their proposed amendment seeks to
prevent the existence of this post-‘ﬁnancial
apocalypse world. They would bring an
end to the institution of currency. Their
constitutional amendment reads, “Neither '
currency, nor any sort of ‘contract, shall_be
made in this land. In order to form a more
perfect union, no individual may own any

object that is not a part of, or attached to, .

their person and all objects shall become
of the common for the perusal of the citi-
zenry.”

' When asked why they chose to speciﬁ-
cally target currency and contract, candid
president of FIBB—UP Bennie Modaff said,
“money is the root of all evil,” and, “Who
wouldn’t want to eliminate evil? So we re-
alized the key — just eliminate money.”
His explanation of why contracts had to
go, too, was also quite sophisticated: “As
soon as you allow contracts, they can be- t

‘ come a form of money. Hey, you banned

using coins? That’s OK, we’re going to use
pieces of paper that correspond to bushels
of corn.” _
Which leads some to question why they
chose to ban all forms of property: “We
realized that even if we banned contracts,
people could just choose something and
use it as money, just like drug cartels have

_ been using bottles of Tide. We needed to

eliminate that possibility altogether.”

-When asked if such a ban included cloth-J

ing, Modaff made clear that they had no
choice, saying ,“If we let people own their
clothes then, just like the bushels of corn
example, they would attach some sort of
pins to their clothing in order to trade —

we needed to eliminate the possibility of «

exchange completely.”
FIBB—UP secretaryjim Damun described

what effect he expects the adoption of such __

a change might have on his future career as
a banker. His response was very introspec-
tive and forward looking. He indicated that
it might be nicer to only “perform mergers
and acquisitions when it is going to help
people” and that he chose ﬁnance with
a concentration in banking because he
“wanted to enable people to achieve their
dreams.” '

According to Damun, many current
bankers report being forced to kill people’s
dreams to make money, something none of
them want to do. He said, “If only there was
no money, then the bankers could simply
gather the resources each company needed
to produce its ideal product, and that’s how

The remaining two-ninths of the Board
must ﬁll the seven open seats before next
week’s public meeting to vote on anything.
Nites said interested students can obtain
applications from his hand—crafted bunker
in the SGB oﬂice on the ninth ﬂoor of the
Williarn'_Pitt Union, and students should
apply by Friday at-3:47 a.m. p _
The Board will then most likely inter-
view the applicants in two public rounds of
interviews and private deliberations before

A the new appointees sign a blood oath- to

promise theirunwavering service to SGB.
“I’m looking for students who can really,

really, really commit,” N ites said. “Really.”
N ites reiterated that student groups

-shouldn’t be worried, and allocations will

- still be a strong focus for SGB.
Abboud, who was appointed president '

pro -tempore after Ellie Tsatsos — the origi-

j _ nal appointee — resigned, said he texted
T Nites after the meeting, telling him, “Just
you and me, buddy” and “We got this. Robin

and Batman.” ,

Abboud dismissed rumors that he would
also leave SGB, and said he is optimistic that
he and N ites will be able to accomplish their
goals, despite the recent losses.

“When” Ellie and Brandon resigned, I
said, ‘This too shall pass.’ Well, now I have
another motto: ‘Quitters never win,”’_ Ab-
boud said.

Abboud also assured audience members

not to worry about the future of SGB.

“We will keep allocating, and you can
keep on doing you,” he said.
Jake Radziwon, a junior marketing ma-

' jor, was the ﬁrst to resign from the Board
‘ back on Feb. 27. Radziwon said he wanted to

step down to pursue personal aspirations,

Radziwon said hisstint on SGB was a

get out when the getting out was good.”
In fact, Radziwon expressed his an-
noyance at Benjamin and Tsatsos pulling
a similar stunt at the last public meeting,
announcing on Twitter the following day:
“whatever, I quit @PittSGB before it was

“Can’t a man have an original thought?”

GALLAGHER

’ “It’s all in line,” Gallagher said. “We just
need some randos who work here to sign
some papers and it’ll be ofﬁcial.” .

josh Triste,::a sophomore communica-

‘ tions major, expressed his disappointment

with the incoming administrator’s plans.
“There was so much promise,” Triste

said. “Thereiarejfso many important things to

be done on‘  like providing gourmet

. food at Marketgtgentral, canceling all Mon-
day classes and legalizing jaywalking on '
.Forbes. Especially legalizing the jaywalking.”

- Triste is not alo'ne_in his sentiments.
A recentlyfolrmed student organization
called Students for a Better Pitt have listed

many of Triste’s visions for Pitt as some of

the key things they hope Gallagher will ad-

‘ dress within the ﬁrst year of his appoint-

ment. .
“Running out ofsoft-serve ice cream at

Market is up there, too,” Molly Chacona, the a

president of the club and a junior electrical
engineering major, said. “If we’ve got the
money to get all of this done, then we should

-pursue it. It’s not like we’ve just gotten out

of a recession or anything.” '
Although Gallagher declined to go into

’ detail regarding the other four parts of the

“G—Plan,” he did say that male students will
be required to cut their hair in a similar
fashion to his own. _

“I’m the chancellor of the University, for
god’s sake. Why 'shouldn’t the young men
who go here look just like me?” Gallagher
said. “Students should reach for the stars.
I am those stars.”

- Gallagher will oﬂicially embark on the
implementation of his plans at the start of
the 2014-2015 school year, and the Univer-
sity will respond with events accordingly.

“We’ll be holding a celebration in Gally’s
Place to kick off the G-Plan,” Fe_dele said.»“By
then, there will be no question who the new
chancelloris. But just in case, students will
be inundated by Campus Connect emails
and ENS alerts to let them know who is in
charge.” .

With all the planned changes for Pitt,
some students, including junior accounting
major Tim Jansen, just want certain things
to stay the same.

“I’m ﬁne with it, as long as they/don’t
get rid of those secret slushies in Nordy’s.
Or Gally’s. Whatever. As long as I get some
slush, I am ﬁne with some ‘G’s,”Johnson said.

POSVAR

coveries, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
has proved to be a thorn in the side of
former nonbelievers. Nordenberg has
stubbornly argued throughout the. pro-
cess that despite recent reports, Posvar
Hall’s top ﬂoors have housed several Pitt
departments for years, including the
schools of psychology, "political science
and education. ‘-
Thesefobjections have themselves
been refuted. The successful custodial
crew credited with the discovery said in
an official statement that it “looked like
no one had been there in ages,” leading
to further speculation as -to whether
the building is older than its suspected

36 years.

This is not the first time the chan-

cellor has tangled with Posvar and its '

uncooperative escalators. In years past,
the amount of complaints about the

escalators grew so high that the prob-
lem was brought before Nordenberg.
It quickly became the marquee issue
for the University, generating a lot of
concern from both alumni and the Uni-
versity community.

When asked about the escalators,
Nordenberg replied harshly, “Sorry for
the convenience. We apologize for the
fact that you can still get up there.”

Despite all of the controversy sur-
rounding the issue, the University is
now beginning to focus its attention

on the future use of the building. One 0
senior official at the University had,

auspicious hopes of turning the top
ﬂoors into a museum, which, along with
Forbes Field’s home plate, would add to
the building’s allure. A

“We will not be turning a University

building that is currently in use into a

museum,” N ordenberg, clearly showing‘

frustration and an unwillingness to con-
cede, said. “This will not be my.legacy.-”

But what do other students think of
FIBB-UP’s scheme to change the way hu-
mans live? ' -

Amy Flomann, a Pitt senior majoring in
neuroscience and Spanish, suggested that
it might be a better way of life —— much like
the ideal Marxist communism.

She explained further, “Everyone could
contribute asmuch as their conscience or

' inspiration moved them to and everyone

could have anything that existed because
itwould all be shared between everyone.”

Anita Locardi, a Pitt junior majoring
in industrial engineering and interior de-
sign, agreed wholeheartedly and chose to
emphasize the local aspect. »

She said, “The best aspect is that every-
thing is controlled locally and in a partici-
patory manner. Only the most important
tasks and products are created and every
individual gets a say because they choose
what they want to work on each and every
day. Plus, there would be no police brutality
or protests. It’s essentiallya utopia.”
