been over-emphasized from the

the action of some of the houses,

Alumni Council Will Decide Policy

On New Plan of Trustee Election

By Fred Lange

The conflict between the Univer-
sity ‘and the General Alumni Asso-
ciation is expected to reach a cli-
max next Monday when the Alum-
ni Council meets to decide upon
drastic changes in the procedure
of electing members to the Board
of Trustees.

The new plan, drawn up by the
nominating committee of the ‘Board
of Trustees because they claim the
present system violates the Uni-
versity. charter, and presented to
the alumni by Chancellor John G.
Bowman, permits the Trustees to
accept or .,reject the candidates
chosen. by the association. Under
the “present plan, nomination by
the Alumni Association is tanta-
mount to election by the Board.
Nicklas’ Comment ’

John B. Nicklas, president of
the General >Alumni Association,
states that the present system is
just as legal as the new proposal,
but, under the new plan, “there
might as well be no election (nom-
ination of candidates by the Asso-
ciation) at all, for it (new plan) is
an attempt to take all the effective-
ness out of the alumni.”

’€«

JOE KRISTUFEK
to lead Panthers

Dr. Bowman, however, claims

that the new plan will assure wider-

representation from the alumni of
all University schools.

A “gentlemen’s
which developed from "a conﬁict
in 1936 in which the Governor
threatened to cut off the Univer-
sity appropriation, obliges the
Trustees to elect the candidates
nominated by the association, say
the alumni.
Chancellor’s Viewpoint ,

The University, however, has
not accepted this interpretation.

Dr. Bowman declaresthat ffthere
is no deﬁnite arrangement about
alumni representation on, the Board

of Trustees.”

Nicklassays, “The new plan, in
my judgement, will - not conform
with the state of Pennsylvania (re-
ferring to the former , governor’s
action) and .is very much
his (Chancellor Bowman’s) own.”

Claiming" that there would be
only one vacancy which the Board
would have to ﬁll from the alumni
list, Nicklas disapproves the new
plan.

Nicklas declared that the pro-
posed plan was presented to him
three days after the trustee nom-
ination list of the General Alum-

lni Association had been prepar-

tell us about it.”

These nominations have not yet
been released.

A University spokesman claims
that the letter from the nominat-
ing committee of the Board of
Trustees was sent on March 20 to
Nicklas with the suggestion that
the Alumni Council take immediate

(action upon it. This source also

claims that the Council was not
informed of the contents of the let-
teruntil April 8.

He also pointed out that the
Alumni, A_ssociation has never elect-
ed representatives to the Board.

They merely nominated candidates

and, under the charter, only the
Board itself can elect members.

Monkey Business

A Fraternities and Independents are tied at one fumble
apiece in the scramble for College Association positions.
A little pressure brought to bear by interested parties
on both sides of the fence kept the botches from being
seriou:-:_. but it was fun while it lasted.

 Frank Miller, the Independent white hope for CA

‘ p're'sident, accepted his nomination but neglected the

detail of ‘handing in a petition. Thus, when the time

' came for the petitions to be passed upon, Panther-man

lVIi-ller was out in the cold.

I 'Question‘ed by a Pitt News reporter, Miller claimed,
in 10 minute intervals, first: that he had not handed in
a petition for personal reasons; second: that he didn’t

' know anything about anything and really wanted to run.

To his rescue came J. Karl Stark, incumbent CA
proxy and incidentally anflndependent. Stark claimed
that when the ﬁnal date for the acceptance of petitions

was changed, insufﬁcient notice was given the candi-

dates. Thus, the blame was ﬂipped neatly to the al-
ready-calloused shoulders of assistant dean of men
Ro..bertiC. Corley, iwhoannounced the change of date.
Asa result of Stark’s protest, Miller’s candidacy re-
céiived ofﬁcial blessing. " ' ‘ ,
From the Fraternity front comes a less compli-
I catedt story. Originally slated for CA vice president,
Kappa Sig--'Dick Frankovich discovered when the ofﬁ-

 cial list of approved petitioners was released that he

was running for treasurer.~’ « V

-..l«Vhether heutook out the wrong petition or whether
the» announcement was'~inc‘orrect»is not known, but it’s
enough to point out that ‘Brother Frankovich is again
courting votes for vice president.’

»Th,e Womcn——Bless ’Em.
~' T‘PC’s so-calle’d"‘l-latch Act” is taking a beating.
Altliough only four of the women’s fraternities voted
to stick_ with the men on slate voting, the fraternity
slates released. today sh.ow women candidates from more
than the original quartet of dissenting houses. ,~,r—
A fraternity memberof SFA’s executive committee
stated recently that thelfraternities would back the act
if all the women favored it, but with many of the
wo.n’ri‘etn‘/treating the FPC merit move indifferently, the
boys can ‘see no point in losing votes by favoring a
system which, if followed implicitly, would “take the
wbrnen out of politics.”
 ,.Qur ,fraternity SFA executive committeeman ad-
mitted that wi.thout_..the women, fraternities would be
lucky to place two slates in SFA. The whole business
becomes less important when it is remembered -that the
fraternity women, three or four houses excepted, have
seldom backed slates in toto, preferring to vote for boy
friends, friends of boy friends, and others unclassiﬁed

and unaccountable.

Druids Can’t Lose

Both parties point to their slates as prime evidences

Solution to War 
World.‘U11ited States’ 

‘ By Ray ‘Palkot
Picturing a Soviet regime over the warring nations

 Europe after the World War II is concluded, Dr. N.

Andrew Cleven, professor of history, believes that

I “Russia. will sit pat. and when the nations have ‘worn

themselves out, will create many disastrous political
revolutions throughout Europe.”

“ He forecasts a pessimistic view of the American

‘ front if the conditions of the war continue in their pres-

ent manner. “We will soon be involved ﬁnancially. In

I "look for the repeal of the neutrality act, especially that

«part involving cash and carry trade.”
“I don’t see any possible hope of staying out of the
war if it keeps on like this.”

 Dr. Cleven, president of the Norwegian Society of
Pittsburgh and a hundred per cent Norwegian-Amer}
can, regrets the invasion of the land of his ancestry.
He says of the attack: “I consider that Hitler made
‘a stupid blunder in invading Denmark and Norway. I
-would be of the opinion that Churchill is right in that

 says that Hitler, like Napoleon I at Waterloo, will _
find his graveyard.

The outcome of the present war will not be as soon
as it might seem. As Dr. Cleven puts it, “I look for a

‘dong war, but I see no hope of Hitler winning this war.”

There is a solution to the problem of war, he thinks.
‘Dr. Cleven advocates not a European United States, but
rather a United States of the world, in which all na-
tions would be subordinated to the national govern-
ment.

4 Europe cannot exist as a distant, combined state be-
cause, Dr. Cleven adds, there are a half of a dozen dis-
‘tinct ethnological units. In a world union, these dis-
tinctions would be subordinated, and gradually there
would grow a strong, central government of the world.

Parking Chairman

Answers Critics
Editor, the Pitt News:

Within the past several weeks,
students have been asking me what
is being done about the parking
problem at Pitt and also what is the
answer to the question. To them I
have answered that the administra-
tion, the students, and the faculty

I have all taken steps toward solving

the problem.
Dr. Weber, secretary of the Uni-

versity, has written to Donald l‘s/IC- "

Neil, traﬁic engineer of the City of
Pittsburgh, setting forth our predic-
zment and registering our com-
plaint. The Student-Faculty Asso-

_ ciation has written a-similar letter.

As yet, the Better Traffic committee
has given no answer. i

As you probably know, the two-
hour parking restriction on Lytton
avenue is several years old. The
restriction on Fifth avenueis «a -new
creation of the city Bureau of Police.
However, the regulation on Fifth
avenue is subject to a 60-d»a‘y“"trifal
period, after which it will be either
abandoned or establ~i'she,d I perma-

nently.  I  ‘

Our only possiblegchance of par-
tially solving this problém lies in
the abandoning of restriction‘ on the
Cathedral of Learning ‘side ‘of Fifth

avenue by the commission. It is the .-

practice of the commission, to con-
sider the wishes of property owners
in the formulation of ,th'eir;regula-
tions. Ruskin ﬁeld: is‘Zpujt, ofﬂthe

Usual Censure
lijditor, theaPitt News:

Apparently there was some mis-
take made in the set-up of your
April 10 issue. “Senator” Ziskind’s
self-"alleged ,“sense” more, appropri-
ately, belonged under the heading
Weak Tea. Devoting half his space
to an awful description of the hor-
,':()1‘S of war, Mr. Ziskind then ad-
vises us that if we want to keep our
‘boys out of European trenches we
must furnish the equipment needed
to keep the British and French
boys i.n thetrenches. I

Probably the reason the “Senator”

- -didn’t explain how an isolationist

policy will get us into war is that
there is no explanation. There has
never been a test of true isolation
policy. We certainly had, however,

a good sample of the plan recom— '

‘mended by your columnist. The
Allies still owe us enough money for
the last war to ﬁnance a fair share
-of this one,

“Everything short of direct inter-

. vention” got us so involved in 1917-‘

that we had to “protect our interest”
.at. an” additional cost ‘of 400,000
American casualties. After they:de.-
‘faulted on their debt, the French
and English do not believe we are
dumb enough to “bite” again. They

..are. quite satisﬁed with the “cash
and carry” plan. ’ 5

Perhaps what Mr. Ziskind has in
‘mind is to sell to th; ‘Pitt students
’lVlr, Roosevelt’s current’ about-face
program. If so, Why not be honest
and state the facts? If the New Deal

. is an admitted ﬁop, why not just say

that a few billion dollars will now
"be spent on armaments in order to
stimulate business’ and satisfy the
steel lobbyists in. Congress?

Are the readers of the Pitt News
not entitled to the truth? Why try
‘to sell them a bill of goods by beat-
ing up the war scare‘?

That one of the factors for choos-
ing Pittsburgh as a site of learning
was its “ﬁne, clear” air.

That in the basement of the Ca-

Kappa Kids Tell Us
Biggest Joke of Year

By Gene Pyle and Beth Hughes

 

Biggest joke of the year concerns one Rugy Aldisert,
Independent BMOC, and one Joe Roberts, fraternity
BMOC. It seems that Joe was absent at the drawing
for positions on the SFA voting machines, and Rugy
volunteered to do the honors. Rugy drew number 19
for himself and number 1 for Joe. Lucky Joe, and con-
dolences to Rugy . . . things are tough everywhere.

While backstaging at the Stanley last week, we
chanced to meet Arthur Treacher, Bela Lugosi, Helen
Parrish, Douglass McPhail, Betty Jaynes, and Marjorie
Weaver. They were all what they are cracked up to
be and were not in the least snobbish or uppish.
Lugosi, minus his Dracula make-up, is’ quite present-
able, and Marjorie Weaver is just g-r-r-randl! (Plug:
she’s a Kappa. from Indiana.)

Passing Candy

Ann Goldszer, vice president of the Phi Sig house,
is passing out the candy these days all on account of her
engagement to Dr. Louis Krieger, Pitt grad. Adeline
Butera no longer goes steady, and Howard Hanna is in
possession of his Druid pin . . . again! Just heard the
word about Jim McIntosh’s engagement. Congrats!

A Cutting short his tour of Pitt clubs in the East, Eu-
gene Burkhart, Alumni Association secretary, arrived in
Pittsburgh last Thursday morning just in time to receive
the news that he was a father. His son will probably be
named Geoffrey Lynn Burkhart.

It was ‘quite an interesting conversation that Ben
Foo-te, D. J..Bailey,:Bill Morton, Rae Young, and Mar-
shall ”’Ma_tt had on what BEAUTY really is. The boys

wﬁiially. decided that when they seek dates, beauty

 first‘, personality a close second, and intelli-
giiince weak third. For additional information, see

--.icNr.Russdz Action

   

 M By “Senator” Ziskind C V

I compliment the directors “of College of the City
of New York for not having "succumbed to the heated
criticism of their employment of Bertrand Russell to
teach higher logic and mathematics. For in their court
ﬁght to remove the injurfction. invoked against Mr. Rus-
sell, preventing the college from hiring him on the
ground of his moral beliefs, the directors are ﬁghting
not only for the ifiterests of Bertrand Russell, but more
important, for untrampled education and its requisite
of academic freedom.

I am not one to get excited about the personal wel-
fare of: Pr-ofessor_Russell. Of that he is well able to
But I am disturbed about the
effects of pu‘ol'ic and private pressure imposed upon edu-
cators to make their pattern of thought conform with
the “accepted” point of view. And therein lies the
issue ofthe Russell incident. ‘ '

Wily He Was Hired

Bertrand Russell has advocated certain unfortunate
views resulting in his. public avowal. of sexual pro-
miscuity. . But Mr. Russell, is an amazingly keen thinker

~ and ‘ranks -with Einstein‘ in‘ his analytical. insight in
mathematics and logic. CCNY employed him, no
doubt, realizing that the fact that Bertrand Russell,
with the handicap of his abhorrent beliefs on sex re-
lationship, had won fame in his mathematical genius
was all'the more in his favor. I

But certain “public spirited” groups fear the dan-
gerous impression which he might leave with his youth-
ful students. I wonder if college students, youthful as
they are, are as subject to “dangerous impressions” as
the membership of these hysterical groups. If the
average college student doesnot have the intelligence
to use ‘his own judgment, even in balancing it with
what some of his professors may say, he is a half wit
eligible for psychiatric observation.

I The struggle for academic freedom, as symbolized in
the Russell case, is nothing new. Certain college presi-
dents have resisted its attackers with unyielding tenacity.
Other college presidents have bowed down to public and

private pressure with the elasticity of a gum band.

The easy way out for a college administrator is to

‘ yield to the clamor. Or to give acsuiescence to a pri-

vate contributor to a. ,university’s income. This ad-

ministrator is certainly not serving the cause of edu.

cation. If anything, waptonly, he is subjecting» his
students to mis-education, _ * .

The Hard Way

The hard Way out ‘for a college administrator is to
Say I0 the meddling crowd or private ﬁnancier: “No,

‘That’s the stand ofD1“‘. Hutchins,-who when approached

within the University of Chicago, Dr. Hutchins politely
suggested that he ran a school, not a sounding board

ageous administrators‘, able and willing to withstand
outside attacks on academic freedom, will education

case they have taken the vanguard position in the up-
ward climb toward academic freedom!

“What the girls will do next year

Zeta Tau Alpha president Julia

sity.” ‘

Murelle Russell, C41, president

the houses signed the pledge, they
at least should live up to their bar-
gain. Of course, I don’t know how

Theﬂcase of the PAA has some

The PAA wants room for its mem-
bers to park while they lunch and

ing on Ruskin ﬁeld, going under-
ground, or parking? all -‘along Park-
man boulevard and envirohé.

Ruskin ﬁeld is at, the moment
in the throes ofa court settlement,
but should be seriously considered
for the future. .- .

The cost and necessary time to
set an underground project in mo-
tion makes it of little immediate
value.

The only recourse left‘ for 7 stu-
dents, unless action is taken, is to
park allalong Parkman boulevard,
up to Trees Gym, and-around the
Stadium. But construction? work

Medical S.chool"~"Parking?  '

The street bythe medical school
buildings is generally ~well, park-
ed. But an estimated 300 cars
could be squeezed in along this ter-
ritory. Of course on such a narrow
street a traﬁic jam will be inevita-
ble when..200 or 300 cars converge
there in the morning. Parkman
boulevard and environs is not the
whole solution to the problem.

What the whole solution is can
only be decided by the students,
the administrati-on, and the police
working together on research and
discussion. Theproblem must; be
started ‘ toward ' a ., solution this
Wee_k-   . “  

If negotiations fail,’ the _students
aroused under expert leadership,
can take direct action‘ and institute

Sidelines

With Bill McElwai11
Sports Editor

DESPITE SOME RATHER confused versions of the champion-
ship game, the freslnnan Polar basketball league. ended its season
just before spring vacation. O

This would ordinarily not be overly important, However, -the
occasion’s noteworthiness rests on the fact that the fresh league was
completing the ﬁrst full season any University yearling squad has
played without engaging in intercollegiate competition. '

When freshman athl..etics went on an intramural basis‘ after the
close of football season last fall, those most vitally concerned, the
coaches and players, were skeptical of tlie plan. \Vhen only 10 or
15 boys showed up for Dr. Carlson’s “basketball class,” the oppo-
sition, passive though it was, becaine convinced that the new System
just wouldn’t work. ' ' ' '

At this point, Drs. Carlson and Zehfuss split the squad into
two teams and entered them in the independent division of ‘the
regular intramural basketball program. Things happened imme-
diately.

Turnout Unexpected

Both clubs breezed through their early games. Newman Club,
defending league champions, won by one point over the weaker of
the two teams, but soon the rest of the opposition were forfeiting
their matches rather than lose by lopsided scores.

Complaints ﬂowed in, both from members of rival teams and
intramural headquarters. Carlson and Zehfuss held out for a short
time but ﬁnally weakened and withdrew their squad, at the same
time issuing a heartfelt plea for boys to drop down to the Stadium
and sign up for a four team freshman league.

‘Nhether the publicity given the dispute was responsible for the
result of their plea is not known, but at least 40 boys joined the new
league. The unexpected turnout swelled the size of the circuit from
four to six teams.

Dr. Zehfuss, having spent‘ some of thebest (and worst) days in
his life on the Stadium hardwood, subtlely named the new loop “the
Polar league” (after the Stadium climate of the same name), and

I the boys chose for their teams such appropriate handles as Polar

Bears, Penguins, Defrosters, Coldspots, Seals,.and Icebergs.

The chilled atmosphere was, still, productive of some “hot”
basketball which glave Dr. Carlson an eyeful of half a dozen boys
who count in is p ans for next year. ' ,  _ ’_

But more irfnportant, the Pplpr leagueproved that the Univer-
sity can success ully manage a u l freshman ‘season in its own back
yard. The “absolute 11eebl” of meeting teams from other schools
was at no time apparent to any convincing degree. 

Muscles Set to Music

THE PANTHER CLUB sets another.-precedent Monday. as

the first time, a group of University altliletes. ..will sponsor ‘a. social
affair. The boys will spend Monday afternoon trying to prove that
there is transfer of training in footwork from the gridiron, track,
diamond, etc., to the dance ﬂoor. .'

This all ﬁts in nicelywith the University’s avowed intentions
to take the varsity athlete out of the class of social non-entity. It
also gives the Panther Club some needed publicity. If head-man Joe
Kristufek’s hopes materialize, every letter winner in school will
some day belong to the club, but events such as the tea dance will

be neces‘sary;,to convi-nee the boys that they can get their money’s

worth.

SAE Nine Plays Air-Tight Game
In Downing Phi Kappa Outfit, .5-1

On the basis of their showing
last week, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
nine will be in the midst of the I-F
race in the league supremacy.

They topped the Phi Kaps, 5-1,
and limited them to a. scant three
hits. Don Cefaratti, pitching for
the victors, mowed down 13 men
via the strikeout routes. Joe Con-

nell, on the mound for the losers, ,

pitched a ﬁne game. but was erratic.

A ﬁeld day for the sluggers was
in order as Sigma Chi doubled the
score over the PiKAs, 14-7. Star-
zynski led the Sigma Chi onslaught

Today’s -outstanding encounter is

and Debaters. This game is to. be

JOHN DICKINSON

Three 19:3§ Pdnlher Line

Regulars to

Aid Bowser

Three members of the 1939 University of Pittsburgh football
squad have been added to the coaching staff this spring,» according
to an announcement by Frank Carver, director of athletic publicity.

The new men, who will be part-time assistants, are John Dick-
inson, Harold “Butch” Klein, and Dick “Congo” Ful'lcrton.

Two of the new coaches, Fullerton and Dickinson, played _to-

gether at Peabody high school. The
latter played a backﬁeld position for
the Highlanders.

Both players were members of
the varsity under coach Charlie
Bowser last season. Fullerton had
his participation curtailed some-
what, however, whena head injury
suffered in the Duquesnelgame and
aggravated in the Fordham contest
forced him to quit for the remainder
of the season. Dickinson also had
to cease his football career after
suﬁering a leg injury.

Continue Studies _ V, g ‘

The other ‘appointed coach, Harold
Klein, hailsfrom Altoona, Pa. Klein
played aimajor partin the success
of his Altoona high school team be-
fore he entered Pitt. Hi_s ﬁne work
with the Panthers last season earned
him _ mention for several “all”
boards. ' V 1 l O W

In conjunction with their coaching
chores, the trio will continue their
studies at Pitt. Dickinson is ex-
pected to enter medical school when
school resumes next fall, Klein will
take graduate work prior to receiv-
ing his degree in education, and
Fullerton will complete the studies
which he missed as a result of his
football injury last season. i ’
Fresh Setup Changed

Although the trio has been aiding
the rest of the staff during spring
drills, the bulk of its regular du-
ties will be with the freshman and
junior Varsity squads. -The Jayvee
schedule has been enlarged for next
fall, and the frosh setup has been
revised to comply with the rule
barring intercollegiate competition
for the yearlings.

Instead of meeting district first
year teams and prep school elevens,
the freshmen will play in a four or
six team intramural league. Rather
than designate the players as first,
second, third. or fourth team ma-
terial, the coaches_ will pick the
teams so that each is of approxi-
mately equal strength. , ‘
