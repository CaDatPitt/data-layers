Coalition still
active as

election nears

Andrew Bergman
For The Pitt News

Although Pennsylvania’s Oct. 4 voterregistra—
tion deadline has passed, Pitt student groups
and outside organizations are still working to
encourage local undergraduates to get out and
vote in the upcoming election.

About 25 student groups are working under
the Student Vote Coalition, an organization op-
eratingunder Pitt’s Student Government Board,
with the goal of engaging more students in the
civic process before Election Day on Nov. 2.

John Hasley, aPitt junior, coordinatorforthe
Student Vote Coaliﬁon and SGB member, said
that while many of the groups participating in
the coalition have political leanings — such as the
College Republicans and Democrats ethe group
is “overallanon-part1'san organization that is just

- interested in getting students to vote.”

Miller Nuttle, a representative from the na-
tional organization ReEnergize the Vote, said
thathis group isworkingin conjunction with the
StudentVote Coalitionto have people sign pledge
cards, which are reminder postcards mailed to
registered voters just before Election Day. ‘

“Ithinkit’s goingto be eﬂ'ective.They’ve done
research, and pledgecards canincrease peoples’
chances of voting by 5 percent,” Nuttle said.

Nuttle also saidthatanother strategy is phone
banking—- orcallingregisteredvoters to remind
them to vote.

“With phone calls and pledge cards, we are

noticeablyincreasingthelikelihoodthatpeople '

will vote,” Nuttle said.

Hasley saidthe St11dentVote Coalitionisplan-
ning another less-orthodox method of getting
people tovote, called “Trick or Vote.”

Police
issues
crime alert

John Manganero
Assistant News Editor

Pitt Police are searching for two people who
committed a strong—armed robbery early
Sunday morning near the 300 block of At-
wood Street. I

Both suspects are black men between
6’4” and 6’6” and weigh about 250 pounds
with a “very large build,” according to crime
alerts posted around campus and on the Pitt
police website.

The men were last seen wearing dark
colored clothing with dark colored hooded
sweatshirts. '

The victim, a Pitt student, told police
she was walking through L-Lot between At-
wood Street and Oakland Avenue around
2 a.m. when she was approached by two
men. The men grabbed the victim’s arms
and demanded she give them her valuables,
according to the alert.

The victim handed the suspects her be-
longings, and both suspects ﬂed the area,
according to the alert. In ante-mail, Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele said the victim’suf-
fered minor scrapes to her back and arms
during the confrontation.

Police issued the crime alert yesterday,
and as of press time Tuesday no suspects
had been arrested and no new information
was available. In the brief, police advised
students to report suspicious people and

. crime incidents promptly, pay close atten-

tion to their surroundings and avoid carry-
ing excess cash.

Fedele said students are advised to com-
ply with actors during a robbery.

People with information regarding this
incident can call Pitt police at (412) 624-
2121. f

Drinks With pickle juice, not pinot noir, asuccess

Stacy Tierle
‘For The Pitt News

“Harry Potter,” “Mike ‘The Situation”’ and
“Santa Claus” all enjoyed mixed drinks in the
Schenley Quad last night while the sounds
of Britney Spears’ “Toxic” attracted a few
hundred less—famous Pitt students.

The psuedo—celebrity appearances came
as Residence Life hosted a Non—Alcoholic
Mix Off‘ in the Quad as part of ‘National Col-
legiate Alcohol Awareness Week.

Throughout the evening, students from
campus residence halls and Pitt organiza-
tions gathered to concoct tasty, clever or odd

drinks in an effort to encourage students
to think twice about alcohol. While all the
groups presented a themed drink, several
organizations took it to another level and
dressed the part. , V
Students from Forbes Hall wore white
tank tops and sportedfoil bling and Sharpie
tattoos as they served “Haterade” from their

‘ Allegheny Shore booth. Freshman engineer-

ing student CJ “Deejay CJ” Stavrakos said
the Forbes Hall residents thought of the
them‘e“l_5eca‘use““we all got a little _bit.ofJer—

. sey trash.”

His friend, fellow freshman Mike “The
Situation” Deckebach said the mixer was “a
rockin’ good time.” ”

Their Haterade, a concoction of lemon-

. ade, sprite and just a hint ofpickle juice was

a strong contender for the “Worst Drink
Award.” V

Erica Njoku, a Pitt junior and resident
assistant in Tower C, helped to organize the
event in the hopes of informing students
about alcohol. _

Pitt’s student health website’s most
recent alcohol-related study in 2006 said
undergraduate Pitt students reported that
71 percent of their peers drink heavily (5 or

more drinks a night), whereas only 51 per-

cent of students admitted to drinking ﬁve or
more drinks within the last two weeks.
.Residence Life hopes to address this dis-

crepancy in perceptions of drinking.
‘ “I think that any effort that is made to

' educate students about alcohol consump-

tion is a step in the right direction,” Njoku
said. .

Students didn’t just get drinks at the
mixer. All of the tables also had ﬂiers or

bulletin boards with facts about alcohol con- I

sumption. Students involved with First Year
Experience pointedout that many students
simply do not know all that they should

' about alcohol. . '

“I learned a lot about drinking that I
didn’t know just from looking up the facts

SGB, endorses candidates

Marissa Meredyth
Staﬁ" Writer

After approving two allocations, the Stu-
dent Government Board moved on to the
real business of the night: homecoming
endorsements.

The Board questioned 14 candidates vy-
ing for the two endorsement positions on
various campus issues. It asked about voter
registration, participation in volunteering
events and what each would do with the title
of homecoming king or queen.

President Charlie Shull made the group
stand up with the Board to sing Pitt’s alma
mater. “I’m watching you,” Shull said as they
began.

The Board took about an hour after the
meeting to choose its preferred candidates,
Jamil Alhassan for King and Board member
Laura Paiewonsky for Queen.

Shull said the endorsement will include
advertisements on the SGB website, Twit—

ter and Facebook pages, as well as future _

endorsements at public meetings and a 1/4
page black—and-white Pitt News ad featuring
a picture before voting ay.

advertisements do not violate any allocation
policies, Shull said. i

To an audience decorated with glittered
ensembles, cheetah prints, blond highlights
and sport coats and ties, Shull said, “I’m a
ﬁfth-year senior. I’ve seen candidates trash
our campus with campaign ﬂyers.”

“I’ve seen candidates hold computers up
to freshmen’s faces and not let them into
their dorms until they vote for a speciﬁc
candidate,” Shull said. “Do not do this.” '

‘ Board member David Petrone is also run-

ning for homecoming king. _
During the meeting, Petrone and

Paiewonsky left their seats tojoin the other-

12 candidates in the audience.

Shull ﬁrst asked all candidates if anyone
was not registered to vote. No one raised
their hand. Shull also ‘asked if anyone did
not participate in Pitt Make a Difference Day.
Three candidates raised their hand — two
had prior work commitments.

Next, one by one, each candidate an-
swered questions about why they wanted
to become king or queen, and what the title
meant to them individually.

Brittany Moreland was one of only three
candidates present who was not involved
in Greek life.

“I’m not a part of Greek life, but I’m still
a part.of the University,” she said.

Alhassan is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha
fraternity. He said following the meeting
that he is the ﬁrst member of his family to
attend college. -

“I’m from Philly, but I’m always told how
lucky I am to be at Pitt from kids who live
10 or 15 minutes from here,” Alhassan said.
“They can’t go here because of low GPAs_
(11.l\..l urxj. DLU1 CD.

One of his main goals is to help low—per—
forming high school students earn better
SAT scores.

petition.

Coalition 4 1

the ReEnergize group, has canvassers dressing
up in costumes and knocking on doors to remind
people to vote. ~ ‘
The Trick or Vote will happen on Friday, Oct.
29, Hasley said.
i In addition to these efforts leading up to Nov.

2, activists on campus are planning some special
tactics for Election Day. These include bringing
people warm beverages while they are in line
and notifying people about polling locations,

' Nuttle said.

ReEnergize hopes to get 6,000 Pitt Students
to vote on Election Day.

That estimate might be abit optimistic. Statis-
tics from last year’s November elections showthat
3,610 people were registered in Oaldand’s Ward4
District 8, which encompasses much of campus, at
the time of the election. Only 84 people voted.

Nuttle said that he has “high hopes”forturn-
out on Election Day, and that “there is a narrative

- in the media that young people are dropping out
of the election, but from what I’ve heard from _

students We talked to, that’s just not the case.”

In aninterview earlierthis month, Alexa]en-
nings, one of the organizers behind the Student
Vote Coalition and Student Civic Engagement
Month,'said the groups’ efforts registered about
2,700 people before the October deadline —
nearly three times their original goal

Hasley also said that aside from Presidential
election years, “this is one ofthe best registration
_totals in recent history at Pitt.”

Students interested in joining the Student
Vote Coalition can attend a meeting at 527 WPU
at 9:30 p.m. today. Q

EDITORIAL

 

Keep your Promise:
Respect LGBT peers

Pledges are not worth ignoring,iespecially
the ones we make to ourselves.

When we come to Pitt, we commit to
uphold a certain set of common princi-
ples. These principles are encapsulated

’ in the Pitt Promise, a list of six rules that

are available on a plaque on the bottom
floor of the Union or on Student Affairs’
website. And as Pitt students try to make
sense of the sexual orientation intolerance
issues that have become so unfortunately
prevalent in the news, this list _can serve
as a valuable source of guidance and mo-

, tivation.

In thinking about current LGBT issues,
perhaps the most relevant principle the

' Promise offers us is as follows: “I will

contribute to the development of a caring
community where compassion for others
and freedom of thought and expression
are valued.”

That is, while story after story of
harassment—provoked teen suicides in
faraway places might leave students feel-
ing powerless to prevent such horrific
consequences of intolerance, we must
remember what we can do here —— that
at least we can make the Pitt community
caring and accepting. No law, ordinance
or policy can completely stop anti-gay
harassment on campus: It’s up to students
to recognize the signiﬁcance of the issue
and to actively contribute for any real
solution to take place.

If you watch the news, you’d know the
cause of tolerance has a long way to go.

Take for example the tragic death of
Tyler Clementi. Clementi, an 18-year-old
Rutgers University freshman, jumped off
the George Washington Bridge in New

York on Sept. 22 after his roommate and
an accomplicelallegedly streamed live
video over the Internet of an intimate
encounter between Clementi and another
man. _

His death accompanies a string of sex-
ual orientation—related suicides among
young people making recent headlines,
and with Howard University student Ai-
yisha Hassan killing herself on Oct. 4,
the deadly trend doesn’t seem tohave
an end.

You might have also heard of New York
gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino’s
hateful" statements toward gays. On Oct.
10, the Republican family-values candi-
date said that he doesn’t want children
to be “brainwashed into thinking that
homosexuality is an equally valid and suc-
cessful option.”

With all of the senseless intolerance
toward gay people pervading the news, we
shouldn’t be discouraged from building
our “caring community.” James Weaver,
president of Rainbow Alliance, agrees.
Although “there is room to improve” at
Pitt, “overall [LGBT acceptance] is good,”
he said. ‘

Therefore interms of acceptance, Pitt
might indeed be already ahead. And if
more students understand the need to car-
ry compassion everywhere they go — i.e.
by taking clear stands against unnecessary
usage of the word “gay” or against injuri-
ous hazing — it’s possible that someday
we won’t hav_e to worry about someone’s
identity being a life or death issue.

Because by now, accepting people for
the beauty of who they are should be sec-
ond nature.I ‘ I

LETTER TO rue EDITOR

 

To the Editor,

I think Andrew Kaback’s Oct. 14 col-
umn focused on (the incredible and ‘
sensational) Michael Vick a bit too
much. Yes, he is a_ convicted felon.
But, the “professional field” that he
is in does not hold that ‘against him to
the point of banning his involvement.

In my opinion, you’re~better off H
boycotting the NFL tharflmy Philadel-
phia Eagles’ epic star quarterback.

A-convicted felon’s ability to com-
pete in the NFL is only harbored, but
not eliminated.

Regardless of whether this is repug-
nant, the rules allow for individuals
suspended from the league to at a later
time reapply for theirjob or a similar
one. ‘

For example, in the NFL, as. my
hometown football hero Mike Vick
has shown, you can lose your job after
receiving a felony conviction, or even
incarceration. After being released
from incarceration, one can be given

the ability to compete for a similar
position within the NFL.

Now, this is not the case in other
realms of professional employment.
Many professionals are banned from
practice once convicted of a felony. .»
Again, this is not the case -for the NFL.

Felons also lose their right to vote,

the ability to run for office and at-

tain various-,-professional licenses or
permits. I A * A '  ‘ I
Again, convicted felons do not lose

their ability to compete for a spot on a
NFL team.

This said, every job field is clearly
very different and has different stan-
dards of employment appliedto them,
but your turning a cold shoulder to the
best No. 7 in Pennsylvaniajust does
notseem right, especially when you
still support the NFL, whose rules it is
that you are unhappy with.

_’’and “American Pie'2.”c Although these ﬁlms

present faithful depictions of the id-fueled
existence that Ricky Martin termed “la Vida
loca,” few of us have enough charisma to
emulate legendary party animals like Van‘
Wilder or that nerdy kid who humped the
pie. Nevertheless, becoming a big man or
woman on campus (“BM/WOC”) is a worthy
aspiration. As your faithful college advice
column, we owe it to ourselves and you to

_' explain how you  go from zero to hero.

First off, you’re going to need athing. All

of the popular people, from Kobe Bryant to .

the Teen Wolf, have a thing. In the case of
Kobe Bryant, it’s the ability to slam dunk the
rock‘. The Teen Wolf can also slam dunk the
rock, and he has the added advantage of be-
ing a teenage werewolf. So now you need to
ask yourself: Is slam dunking the rock your
thing? If not, you should try to develop an-

wrestlers en route to a money match with the
champ. In other words, We’re telling you to
get out there and start crushing the opposi-
tion. Most scenes are ﬁlled with rivals, and
until you can rid yourself of them you’ll never
be the top dog. Do you think that Van Wilder
reached the. pinnacle solely on the merits of
his winning smile?..0f course not: He cracked
a bunch of eggs to make his omelet, and the
less popular people on his scene were left

_ behind to pick up the eggshells.

Now that you’ve got heat, you’re ready
for your coming-out party. This is the mo-
ment when you leave minor fame behind and
become the biggest thing this campus has
ever seen. If you need to know what We’re
talking about, watch_some of those shows
featuring the best celebrities of our time.
Jersey Shore’s “JWoww” is a good example
of this. Several years ago, she was just some
anonymous person living in an unknown
town. Now she’s one of the most popular
people in the history of popularity, and few
have handled the transition to stardom with
such gentleness and grace.

After you’ve madeit to the top, you must
remind people that you have no intention

lonely, unlovable loser. s  

other thing. Some things to consider include
computer hacking, getting your swole on,
kung fu, Madden 2010, tanning, Pokémon,
black market dentistry and Facebooking.

Once you’ve got your thing, you have to
start ﬂaunting it on the scene. There are
many different scenes on our college cam-
pus, so' you should try to pick the one that
suits you. The music scene, which occurs at
concert halls and other venues where music
is played, is deﬁnitely where you want to be
if you love singing those old, soulful tunes.
Sports stat geeks might ﬁnd a home in a
Yahoo! fantasy sports group, where they
can talk on-base percentage and isolated
power with people who are probably going
to be impressed by that. Social networkers
can make virtual appearances by clicking
the “yes” button on their numerous e-vites.
Dramatic types will want to take to the stage,
which-according to one popular quotation
consists of “all the world.” We think that’s
probably the largest of the scenes, although
astronomers might occupy an even bigger
one.

After you’ve rocked the scene, you should ,
begin building some heat. If you don’t know ;
how to do this, take a cue from WWE. When-.

ever a new villain was stepping up to feud
with the peroxide-blonde behemoth “Hulk”
Hogan, he would squash a bunch of lesser

of leaving. One time—tested method of do—
ing this was bullying. But according to the
cover of a recent issue of “People Magazine,”
this practice is now quite controversial and
might even cause you to lose your popular-
ity. Instead, you should fall back on self-
promotion.]ustin Bieber’s nail polish project
is instructive in this regard. We’re not sure
if he uses this stuff, but all of the young girls
who apply it to their nails will be reminded

that he is still the nation’s top cutie pie. By '

informing everyone of how amazing you are
with a hit spin-off product, you’re guaran-
teed to continue hogging the spotlight for
years to come.

No one wants to leave college a lonely,
unlovable loser, and by following insider
tips like ours there’s an excellent chance that
you won’t. Of course, even if you do, you can
remain sad and bitter about it for the rest

A of your life — and maybe that can be your

thing. “Check out that sad and bitter guy,”
people would say. “We’ve heard a lot about

him, and he’s really making the scene. What A

a downer!” —

A5'E Editor

Donal Logue (“Grounded for Life”) and his “Ter—
riers” co—star Michael Raymond-James (“True
Blood”) are taking a more personal approach
to advertising their show.

Today, the FX show’s stars will appear in
Room 352 of the Cathedral of Learning at5 p.m.
The room opens at 4:30 p.m. The actors are cur-
rently traveling around the country in a tour bus
plastered in“Terriers” materials in orderto show
episodes, talk to audiences and answerviewers’
questions about the show.

Ifyouthinkthe show “Terriers” is about dogs,

you’re quite mistaken. The show is really about

two friends, Hank Dolworth (Logue) and Britt
Pollack (Raymond—]ames), who start a small

_private—investigation business together. The

website describes their situation as one where
they’re “too small to fail.”

Carl Kurlander, screenwriter and Pitt pro-
fessor, was a self-described “lightning rod” in
getting the men to make a stop here through the
Pitt in Hollywood program, which has brought
in more than 30 speakers from the entertain-
ment industry.

“This goes to what PittinHollywoodis really
about. A lot of our aim is really to demystify the
process of ﬁlmmaking to students,” he said.

“Demystify” is the same word Logue used
in explaining what he hopes his presentation
does for students, particularly those who hope
to break into the industry.

“Listen, we were sitting where you’re sit-
ting now and this is just from the beneﬁt of two
decades of hindsight and experience,” Logue
said. .

Logue, who earned a history degree at Har-
vardand performedinmorethanso plays during
that time, explained that both his academic and

‘ life experiences have been crucial parts of his

education. He said ﬁnding a balance between
the two is incredibly important

“You can’tjustwingitinstructural engineer-
ing or heart surgery,” he said. “[But] I think if

life presents a cool opportunity to you, take it. .

You can continue your education [later]. Your
education should continue anyway.”

Those aren’t the only words Logue hopes to
pass along to students who are entertainment
hopefuls. He brought up a line that his co-star,
Raymond-James, says frequently in relation to
being successful, particularly in acting.

“Just like ballerinas have to stretch and ath- .

letes have to exercise, you want to do this

Music Columnist

N o matter how much we love our favorite bands
as collective entities, there will be times when
their members will go their separate ways and
create music as individuals. T

The perfect case study can be found with
those darlings of garage—rock revivalism known
as The Strokes. Accordingto Rolling Stone Maga-
zine earlier this year, the New York quintet’s
debut album I: T/air It, released in 2001, was the
second—most important album of the decade
and,in this co1urr"1nist’s.opini'on, thatwas about
one place from where it should have been.

The band continued making music through
20o3’s Room on Fire and 2006’s Fim‘ Iﬂgbmrzbns
of Ban‘/9, but after that album’s more lukewarm
response and the usual musical fatigue, the group
decided to take a break. . L

From that point up untilthis surnrner’s shows
at Lollapalooza and other summer festivals, each
member of the group had put forth at least one

competent solo effort, each perhaps showcasing A

Flashbulb Fires tours old—school style

Band travels around the country in an old vanfor more than a month at a time to play shows in various venues

Four musicians on a cross-country road tour
in a 15-year-old van sounds like a romanticized
image ﬁ'om the past, but one indie—rock band,
Flashbulb Fires, is traveling in exactly that fash-
ion.

The group has toured extensively since
releasing its debut album, G/09/, in December
2009 and will perform a show tonight at the
Shadow Lounge.

“We’re no strangers to [touring] . We toured
nonstop for the ﬁrst part of 2010. It’s always
been‘ a focus of our band, since we started, to
get out on the road and get our music to as many
places as possible,” said Michaeljames, electric
guitarist and vocalist.

The band does all of its own booking and
press, whichjames described as a mixed bless-

“It’s a lot of work, so at some point we’d like
to have a team of people helping us so we can
focus more on what it‘is that we actually do,
which is play music. But at the same time, the
bonus of [doing our own booking] is that we
care‘ about whatwe’re doing and we’ll do what-

ever work is required to make tours happen. 4’

We care more than anyone else because it’s our
band,” he said.

Based out of Denver, the band often had a
ﬁill day’s drive before they could start playing
shows, but after that experience they tried to
break up the drive with concerts as much as
possible. After booking a show that required a
drive from Kansas to New Hampshire inasingle
day, the bandhas “learned [its] lessonin routing:
Try notto drive morethan a manageable four to
ﬁve hours between cities,”James said.

“The way we route our tours is to try to hit
major cities thatwe thinkare kind of cool. Pitts"-
burgh is new to us. We’ve never been there, but
we’ve heard nothing but good things about it,”
James said. '

“It’s rare that we come into atown and don’t
know anyone. Usually between the four of us
we know, somebody or know somebody who
knows somebody,” said Chris Stumiolo, drum-
mer and vocalist.

With a suitcase and instrumént—laden trailer
towed behind them for more than amonth ata
time, getting along is essential. “We kinda have
to. You can imagine everybody has their mo—
ments on a ﬁve—week trip in a van, but we’re in
it together so we make it work. We love being
out on tour,” Sturniolo said.

Flashbulb Fires formed morethana year and

a halfago whenjames wasin-between projects V

and came across some of pianist, acousﬁcigiﬁe
tarist and vocalist Patrick McGuire’s recordings
on Myspace. He reached outto him and the two
found Suurniolo and bassist and vocalist Brett

' Schreiber on Craigslist.

“Its not that good a story, but there is an
amazing randomness to it that we were able
t9.get together and havesuch greatshemistw
and be as successful as we’ve been able to be,”
James said. '

Sturniolo is a trained audio engineer and
owns some of his own recording equipment,

......~.» Inn: »~- ‘ :<w-1"‘ -

which allowed the band to record its album Clog
at its own pace without fearing the high cost
of studio time. The members rented a house
in Denver and converting it into a makeshift
recording studio.

“It’s nice to have that time to let things grow a
ilittleztiore natumﬂy and have time to get things
exactly how we want them,” Sturniolo said.

The band members spent several months
ﬁnessing the album before having it mastered
in Los Angeles.

“The biggest thing foruswith the albumwas
that we wanted to make something cohesive, not
justabunch of songs on the same CD. Callus old
fashioned, but we like the idea of a complete al-
bum that goes together and tells a bunch oflittle
stories and a larger story t:oo,”James said.

As for its concert here, the band recognizes
that it might not sell out the show, but it’s con-
ﬁdent that its music will reach the people who
do attend.

“We’re not above startingina coffee shop just
to getinfront of some people and earn beingin
that city and earn the respectof the people in

that city. We know at this level we’re not always

going to play to a packed house, but even if it’s
only 10 people in the audience, if those 10 are
totally into it and we’ve affectedthem, thenthat’s
a successful show,“_]ames said. I D

MEN'S SOCCER

Goalkeeper finds place at Pitt

" Greg Trietley

Senior Staﬁ” Writer

3 Pitt goalkeeper Hami Kara always wanted to

play NCAA Division I soccer. And he thought

 that being a good goalkeeper and working
3 hard in practice was all that mattered to
,1 achieve that goal.

But his grades in high school left him

 ineligible to play at avDivision I school.

‘ That taught him a lesson, and he went to A

 Manchester Community College in Con-
necticut.

“I learned [at Manchester] that school is

: more important than soccer, so I put more
l time into school, and now I am doing very
B well,” Kara said. “It opened up many doors
1 3for me academically and athletically.”

% 3' At Manchester, he posted some eye-
1 Clpopping statistics. He had 16 shutouts in
, ‘-20 games played, a 0.25 goals-against aver-
 age and a grand total of four goals allowed

all season. \ - ,
A handful of programs — including Cin-
cinnati, Hartford, Pitt, Rhode Island and
53Temple —- wanted him. But in the end, the

Panthers got him. -

Kara saw Pitt soccer’s 2-13-2 record last
year, a year with seven one—goal losses, and
wanted to turn things around.

“I saw the season they had last year, and

I thought that I could step in here and be a A

leader and help keep my team in games,”
Kara said.

This fall, with an experienced defense
in front of him, he’s done just that. Pitt
disowned last year’s dreadful record and
jumped out to a 6-5-2 start.

His coach at Manchester, Jim Insinga,
had high praise for his former star.

“He was the team captain his sophomore
year, and he was, in my opinion, the best
captain in my 11 years at [Manchester], no
question,” Insinga said. “It was a joy having
him on the ﬁeld.”

Kara opened this season with a ﬁve-save .

blanking of Robert Morris. After a 2-1 dou-
ble-overtime victory over’ St. Bonaventure,
the junior racked up two more shutouts
against Army and St. Joseph’s. Last Satur-

day’s-3"-0 win over Rutgers gave him his sixth -

shutout of the year and dropped his goals-

E3 Pitt goalkeeper Hami Kara has posted some impressive statistics, in part thanks to the Panthers defense’s knack for stiﬂing the shot.

against average to 1.05.

The defense helps

Kara credited the experienced back line
of Andy Kalas, Connor Malone, Shane Flow-
ers and Alex Harrison for his solid start.

“I am not earning these shutouts by my-
self but-with the help of my team and espe-
cially the four guys who play in front of me,”
Kara said. “They go all-out into every tackle,
every header, every loose ball, which shows
how determined they are to keep the other
team from getting shots off on our goal. I am
only averaging less than three saves a game,
and that’s because our defense is completely
shutting down ouropponents and leaving
less work for me.”

Kara said he wants to break the single-
season Panther record of 10 shutouts.;;,The

» number reﬂects solid defense as much as it

does good goalkeeping, he said. .
Seniors Kalas, Malone and Flowers and
the freshman Harrison provide that defense,

THROWING A KIRSCH BALL

Never fear,
basketball
is here

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

 

‘ It’s ﬁnally here. b

With practice in session and the Blue-
Gold Scrimmage on Friday night, college
basketball season has arrived. With college
football, the NFL and baseball playoffs in full
swing, college basketball might go unnoticed

4 by some. But it won’t go unnoticed by me

and — I have a feeling -— many students
on this campus.

For me, college basketball means the ar-
rival of my favorite time of the year. It means

last second game-winning shots, upsets, un-

derdogs and, eventually, March Madness.
For people at Pitt, at least, college basket-

ball season means Big East basketball season.

As opposed to football in the Big East, the

' idea of conference play in basketball doesn’t

make people cringe. -

The Big East is the best conferencein the
country year in and year out, and although
this year is considered a down year for the
conference, who doesn’t get excited at the
prospect of playing West Virginia, Villanova
and Connecticut?

The Big East should enter the season with
ﬁve teams in or around the Top 25, includ-
ing Pitt, Villanova and Syracuse around the
top 10.

And if the Panthers happen to fall in an
early game, here’s the best part: It doesn’t
mean their season is over. Even better, all
those mid—majors and underdogs that every-
one loves to root for actually get the chance
to play for a national championship.

The Boise States of the basketball world
get the same opportunity to win it all as the
Oklahomas. Yes, I’m still bitter that Okla-
homa jumped Boise State in the BCS stand-
ings,Vbut I think I’ve ranted enough about
the BCS system in my column enough to le
it pass with just one insult. ‘

That might be what I love most about
college basketball: Everyone gets a chance.
If you have a good season, odds are you are
going to be rewarded with a berth in the

?The Pitt goalkeeper has a chanceto break Pitt’s record for most shutouts in a season

Kara 4 11

- “They play well together,” Luxbacher

‘ said. “They’re a tough group, and they’re

an experienced group.”

The only underclassman of the”group,
Harrison, is not a typical ﬁrst-year, defender.
The native of the Isle of Man played overseas
for St. Georges Association Football Club
before crossing the Atlantic.

“He’s a ﬁrst-year player, but he’s tough
and experienced, and I consider him a leader
back there,” Luxbacher said. “He’s not what
you typically think of a freshman, coming
in all wide-eyed.”

Kalas said that Harrison hasn’t had trou-
ble getting in sync with the three Panther
veterans. '

“He’s alot more mature than a true fresh-
man,” Kalas said. “We all have to be on the

« same page, so we all help each other out.

Alex is a great defender and a great player,

, so it was a smooth transition.”
The last line of defense, and the team’s

eye
Still, the team couldn’t succeed without

Kara. From the stands, you can hear the N I-
«. pun 1' 11- at-‘.I.ccl1l1'A11-'AlIIl€I'lCaIl during games

- as he directs the back line.

“As a goalkeeper, you are able to see the

.l whole entire ﬁeld and see exactly everything

going on,” Kara said. “The rest of your team
can’t, so you need to be able to direct your
teammates to what is going on and what
is coming their way so they know what to
do.”

The back line appreciates Kara’s commu—
nication. Kalas said that Kara’s perspective
of the ﬁeld lets him see gaps in the defense

Hami Kara: .

year just because he’s back there.”
Through the ﬁrst nine games last year,
the Panthers allowed 18 goals. This year,
they halved that, and with Kara in goal,
defenders feel more comfortable pushing

- the tempo.

“He gives us more leeway,” Kalas said.
“We can be a little more aggressive, and if

I am not earning these a

shutouts myself.

and adjust it.
“It’s invaluable, having complete trust in
him and knowing what he sees,” Kalas said.

. “Trnstinew at .e,says.he1Ds us Qrganize-the
defense an " ma es sure*we’re‘urtne=rrgnt-*

spots at the right times and makes sure no
one misses, a guy running through. We’ve
avoided a lot of the mistakes we’ve made last

we don’t get there in time, he’s right there
behind us to cover us.” .
With his track record, Kara has already

earned the trust of his teammates.
‘ A “we airtrustﬂami to‘ make me big saves

when we need him to,” Malone said. “We
really are able to push the tempo and play
more attacking soccer.”

PITT Vs. RUTGERS

Strong defense helps Kara aim for most, shutouts

Kara, though, didn’t have the starting job
before the season began. Returning starter
Keegan Gunderson was initially favored
for the position, according to Luxbacher.
But Gunderson suffered a concussion in
August and remains out with concussion
symptoms.

“Hami was probably even with [Gun-
derson] before he went down,” Luxbacher
said. “He just took advantage of an oppor-
tunity.”

Kara pushed Gunderson for the starting
job not just because of his skill on goal, but
also because of his work ethic, Luxbacher
said. \

“He prepares himself to be the best he
can be,” Luxbacher said. “I don’t think some
of our other guys realize how important that
is. Guys see what he’s doing and see how hard
he works, and obviously the other guys know
that if they don’t work that hard they’re go-
ing to stick out like a sore thumb.”

Kara’s drive goes back to his time at Man-
chester.

“He just absolutely excelled as far as it

tra1n'1ng,‘* msmga saiur 1 uuim mat s wnat
got him to the top, his ability to just stay
focused and train hard every day. That’s
what got him to Pitt.”I

Basketball is actually fair

Kirschman < 11

Diana Connor I For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Gilbert Brown will compete in a dunk contest at the Petersen Events Center Friday.

NCAA Tournament. If you’re a conference
champion, you’re getting into it. If you go
undefeated, you‘ better believe that you’re

www.juiceboxpitt.com 0 getting the same opportunity to take home
731 Copeland Street —- Shadyside

the hardware as another undefeated team
. from a better conference. .

Okay, so that was two shots at the BCS.

There’s parity in.men’s college basketball
that doesn’t exist in many other sports. Sure,
football will have the occasional eyebrow—
raising upset, but it happens several times
a year in basketball. It happened a lot in last
year’s NCAA Tournament. Who’s going to
forget Northern Iowa defeating No. 1 seed
and tournament favorite Kansas last season?
You can’t make this stuff up. -

If college basketball was college football,
Butler wouldn’t have gotten the chance to

play for the national title last season. In col-’

lege basketball, the ability to perform is all
that matters, despite whether your jersey
says Duke or South Carolina Upstate. Yes,
that’s a real school; I’ve always wanted to use
it in a column. Sports don’t get any better

than basketball.

And here on this campus, the Blue— Gold
Scrimmage is offering something new this
year. Over the years, I’ve been envious of
schools that have Midnight Madness. But
not this year. We might not have Midnight
Madness, but we’re getting a slam dunk
contest.

I know I’m looking forward to seeing Gil-
bert Brown, Nasir Robinson,_].]. Moore and
Cam Wright throw down. 1 .

If you’re a Pitt fan, get yourself up to the
Pete on Friday. Not only is the Blue-Gold
Scrimmage the ﬁrst chance for you to see
this year’s Panthers in action, but you also
get the added bonus of watching the newly
implemented dunk contest after the gamei,

Thousands of fans packed their arenas}
this past weekend for Midnight Madness. Ll
for one, would love to see thousands of fans
in the Pete this Friday to welcome the start
of college basketball seasonto Pittsburgh,
where Pitt has the same chance as every;
other school to win it all. I
