Three CMU alumni convicted

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Three Carnegie Mellon University alumni were convict-
ed for their role in the death of a fraternity brother at a
December 1994 party.

William Halpin, 23, and Thomas Hummel and Stephen
Marting,-both 24, were convicted of furnishing alcohol to
a minor, CMU sophomore Justin Chambers.

On Dec. 10, 1994, Chambers, a Pi Lambda Phi fraterni-
ty brother, died after attending a Christmas party. His
blood alcohol level was .54 at the time of his death, more
then five times the legal limit for driving in
Pennsylvania. « «

CMU Campus Police filed charges against Chambers’
fellow fraternity brothers, Halpin, Hummel and Matting,
for sponsoring the party. .

The three are scheduled to go for sentencing on May 1,

after being convicted on Feb. 29 in a non—jury trial in
front of Pittsburgh Judge Raymond Novak, according to
The Tartan, thestudent newspaper at CMU. They could
be sentenced to up to a year in jail.

According to The Tartan, CMU administrators and the
Greek community are in the process of forming new poli-
cies to prevent this from happening again. .

Chambers’ death came a little over a month after Pitt
student Atif Bhatti died of alcohol abuse while celebrat-
ing his 21st birthday. Bhatti was in a North Oakland bar,
where, according to Pitt Police, he drank 16 shots of
whiskey in 45 minutes. He died several hours later at
Pitt’s Delta Sigma Phi fraternity house on North
Dithridge Street, where he was a brother. .

Before Bhatti's death, Pitt was in the process of forming
an alcohol task force. Last year, that panel recommended
Pitt provide an alcohol-free living environment and
expanded alcohol—awareness programs.

Writing students to
learn lesson in politics

By Cesca Antonelli
Staff Writer

~ Pitt’s writing program is
offering interested stu-
dents a new opportunity to
get hands-on experience
studying political report-
ing next semester.

. .Campaign_ 3196 is a  
Topics ‘in Nonfiction class

in which students will
write V about . both
Democratic and

Republican political candi- -

dates and events in two or
three “animated” cam-
paigns on the national and
local levels.

“It’s going to be an on-
the-front—lines type of edu-
cation,” Bill Moushey, the
instructor, said.

Students will meet polit-
ical writers, pollsters,
campaign managers and
candidates, in addition to
attending rallies and elec-
tion-night activities in
local campaign headquar-
ters.

Moushey, an investiga-
tive reporter for the

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
has worked in journalism
for 20 years and teaches a

news writing class at Pitt

each semester.

“I’m always am-azed at
how little folks know
about the political
process,” Moushey said.

In addition to attending

debates, speeches and ral-
lies, Moushey intends for
students to cover local

board meetings to get a-

sense of how grass-roots
organizations work.
“I want people to get a

' really clear first—hand look

at how political campaigns
operate,” Moushey said.

“They’ll understand the;

larger picture a bit more.”
Patsy Sims, the coordi-
nator of the nonfiction
program in the English
Department, wanted‘ a

could get an idea of what
went into both conducting

Victory for student aid, but more fig/its ahead

By Joe Wright

said.

News Editor

On Tuesday, the Senate approved the
Specter-Harkin ‘amendment, which
restored federal student aid funding in the
fiscal year 1996 budget to 1995 levels.

The House version of the bill, and the
original Senate version, would have elimi-
nated federal student aid programs such as
Perkins Loans and Student Incentive
Grants. This represents a victory for those
crusading to save student aid, but those
crusaders have no time to rest on their
laurels. .-

The final FY1996 budget still must pass
a conference committee that will begin
today. This committee must iron out the

I. differences between the House and Senate

versions of the bill.

The United States Student Association
is the catalyst for student aid—related lob-
bying efforts. Student Government Board
Member Keith Campbell and SGB
Governmental Relations Chair Brian
Heffron are currently in Washington,
D.C., working with USSA. Heffron
explained that states near Washington,
such as Pennsylvania, provide the bulk of
the USSA members lobbying Congress
directly in the capital.

Heffron expressed a mood of cautious
optimism regarding Tuesday’s Senate
vote. “I’m really excited about what
we’ve accomplished, but it’s not over,” he

“Even at level funding [maintaining
FY1995 student aid levels, which the
Specter-Harkin amendment calls for], we
still lose six to eight percent on cost of

living and inﬂation,” he said, “but it’s bet-

ter than it could have been.”

Even now that the FY1996 budget is
finally in its later stages, legislators and
lobbyists have no time to rest. According
to Heffron, President Clinton must present
the FY1997 budget to Congress before the
end of the month. Student aid cuts will
certainly be considered again in this bud-
get.

‘While saving aid is almost a universal
goal among students, it is often difficult

for students to see how some issues sur-

BEIJING — As the Chinese
military commenced live
ammunition exercises off
Taiwan on Tuesday, mainland
China was sending unambigu-
ous signals to the United States
that China does not intend to
invade Taiwan, Chinese and
Western officials say.

But these assurances gave no
clue as to how long Beijing

would continue the exercises,
which have led to fears that
China’s armed forces could
touch off a military clash in
the Taiwan Strait with an acci-
dent, miscalculation or a stray

DETROIT — A week—old
strike‘ at factories producing
critical parts for General
Motors has led to the closing
of nearly three—quarters of the
company’s assembly plants in
North America, with some
83,000 GM workers idled.

What began last Tuesday as
a strike by the United
Automobile Workers union at
two brake factories in Dayton,
Ohio, has turned into a much
broader struggle between the
world’s largest automaker and
its union. At issue is the extent
to which GM will continue to
make its own parts or buy
them from other companies,
which in many cases are not
unionized. The New York

victed of the murder charge in

Pont could face a maximum

AIKEN, S.C. —- For the first
time since the beginning of the
atomic age, the United States
has opened a factory to pack-
age the. worst waste from
nuclear weapons production in
a form that is intended to be
safe for the long term.

Energy Secretary Hazel R.
O’Leary opened the Defense
Waste Processing Facility,
where liquid waste that has
been stored in deteriorating
steel tanks will be solidified
into high-strength, radiation-
absorbing glass.

The newly repackaged waste
will have to be stored for thou-
sands of years, and govern-
ment officials still do not have
a permanent site for it. But for
the foreseeable future, they
say, the poisonous waste will
no longer be able to leak into
the soil. The New York Times

The Pitt News, Thursday, March 14, 1996

(Joseph McDowell is a
guestcolumnist for The Pitt
News)

Webster’s defines di-ver-
si-‘ty (noun) as “l. the condi-
tion of being different:
VARIETY; 2: an instance or
a point of difference.” Can
we agree that “VARIETY”
and “difference” appear to be
the major words working
here? If so, can we then say
that Pitt, to a large degree, is
diverse? Before we can
answer, we need to know the
meaning of “diverse.”

We b s t e r ’ s
defines di-ver-se
(adj.) as “l. dif-

composed of dif-
ferent elements or qualities;
see DIFFERENT.” Again,
the issue of difference is pre-
sent, and from this definition
I would say that Pitt is
diverse and that there is
diversity at Pitt.

But what I find problemat-
ic about these two terms is
the fact that all they do is
identify what we already
know —— that there are people
at the University of
Pittsburgh who are different:

we need to be thinking about
are ways we can add some
action to the terms diverse
and diversity that will, in a
supportive way, force all of
us to deal with our differ-
ences and to learn more
about one another. Instead, it
is easier to use diversity as a
tool to keep us and our dif-
ferences isolated from others,
not allowing others to learn
from us, and in turn we can-
not learn from them.

rounding student aid can
affect them. Direct lending is
one such issue. Pitt students
are not eligible for direct lend-
ing, yet continuing that pro-
gram has been one of the key
items of Campbell and

Heffron’s agenda.

Heffron explained why:
“Pitt is not a direct—lending
institution, but it helps Pitt by
making it a freer market,
which helps keep interest rates
lower.”

In this time of shrinking
resources and budget cuts,
groups such as students will
be continually fighting for
their piece of the federal pie.
Heffron sees the Specter-
Harkin amendment as a defi-
nite step in the right direction
for students.

“This fight really sets the
tone, -in the Senate especially,
for positive educational legis-
lation.”

The tone is set, the cam-
paign is on, but students must

they want to save their student

Diversity

°From page 2

even actually did participate in
class discussions, it was diffi-
cult. My experiences, as an
“underprivileged” black male,
usually differed from those of
my classmates. My voice" and
my words were rarely ever
heard. I think that people heard
what I was saying, but because
my words were diverse (expe-
riences different than most of
the people in the class, includ-
ing my teacher), my words
drifted into the air and, frozen
by the silence of the room,
they crashed to the ﬂoor. With
them, my hopes of truly suc-
ceeding at this institution fell,
because I felt that what I had
to say was unimportant and
had no relevance to class dis-
cussions.

This seemed to be similar to
the experiences of many of the
black students that I met my
first year at Pitt. That was
1984. Two years later I was
suspended from the university
because of poor academic
standing.

In September l996'it will
have been 10 years since I was
academically suspended from
the university. For five of those
10 years, I worked a full—time
job at night and attended class-

es at Pitt during the day. I was
determined to graduate with a
college degree, but on my sec-
ond go-around, I wouldn’t let
my “diversity” be the reason
for my failure. I worked hard
to ignore the fact that, at most
times, my words wouldn’t be
understood. I said what I had
to say regardless of whether
others could relate. I graduated
with a degree in English writ-
ing in December of 1993, and
currently I am in the graduate
writing program of the
Department of English.

What I remember most
about those five long years of
work and school were two
classes that I completed. The
names of the classes arenot as
important as the instructors
and professors who taught
them. In these classes I was
exposed to a new way of
teaching — at least for me it
was a new way of teaching.

The teachers made us sit in a
circle so we could all see one
another. They made us intro-
duce ourselves to the rest of
the class. They allowed us to
debate different topics, but,
most of all, they did not allow
one student’s voice and opin-
ion to be silenced by anyone in
the class, including the teacher.

The room wasn’t as cold,
and my voice ﬁnally rose to be
heard and debated along with
the voices of other minority
students in the class. I thank
(not only those instructors who
taught me) those teachers who
are taking the extra effort to
make class a true learning
experience for all. Personally,
I’d like to thank Beth Newborg
and Professors Cynthia
Sutherland and Jean Carr.

What does all this have to do
with the word diversity? I now
teach General Writing here at
Pitt. My main emphasis is to
teach students to write “rea-
sonably correct prose” as
required by the English
Department. Just as important,
to me, is that the students not
be silenced. I tell my classes
that we are here to learn from
one another. We all know we
are different. Let’s take action
and do something constructive
and educational with our dif-
ferences instead of isolating
ourselves from taking part in
the true educational process of

learning about ourselves, oth-
ers and the world around us.

Instead of concentrating on
the word diversity as a means
for change, let us look to the
classroom, the instructors and
the professors who have the
greatest opportunity to take
diversity and do something
constructive and educational
with it.

Students, let your experi-
ences be known. Don’t be
afraid to put your words in the
air to be challenged by others.
In turn, and equally important-
ly, we TAs, instructors and
professors should be incorpo-

rating into our class plans '

strategies for dealing with this
thing called diversity. For
diversity itself does nothing. It
is a noun -——— a person, place or
thing. If we add action to
diversity and make it do some
work, it will benefit all of us
here at Pitt.

No union, no strike

How many classes have you had where you rarely saw the actual
professor, but were instead the beneﬁciary of “group discussion”
led by a TA? Have you ever been in a class in which your recitation
leader was your primary grader, with only limited evaluation by the
professor? If you have experienced these things, then you might
understand why a group of graduate students and TAs want to form
a union.

On Tuesday night, the William Pitt Debating Union and the
Graduate Student Progressive Action Network sponsored a debate
to argue the pros and cons of forming" just such a union. Major
complaints by TAs are the fact that they often do much more than
the professors they are assisting, though they get paid much less.
To a very limited extent, they have a good point.

However, there are certain aspects of the TA job that those who
seek to unionize have neglected to accept. A graduate student who
is fortunate enough to be awarded an assistanceship is given a par-
tial or full-tuition grant, on top of being paid a salary while getting
his or her degree. TAs are not, technically, instructors — they are
students. Many of them are studying to eventually teach in their
fields of study, and a role as TA or instructor for a lower-level
course is a valuable part of their educational experience. TA posi-
tions are something along the lines of student teaching for educa-
tion majors — you get paid while you study and gain experience.

Also, the TA role is the amoeba on the evolutionary scale of edu-

cation (higher only than undergraduate students). TAs are the low- A   "    

est level, similar to a ﬁrst-year law student with a summer clerk-
ship. You do not get to be a partner in a major law ﬁrm in your first
year out of law school; you get to be the ofﬁce slave, doing endless
hours of research and writing tedious briefs for the higher-ups
while they make their millions and you eat ramen noodles. The
same is true of education, medicine and virtually any other profes-
sion you can think of. Advancement, both in respect and financial
compensation, come with time. TAs are fortunate enough to have a
_spot at the bottom of that ladder. V

Finally, if TAs and graduate students form a union and eventually
strike for higher wages, the entire university community is going to
be adversely effected. Undergraduates will suffer because, whether
you like it or not, TAs are a major part of almost all lower-level
classes. Graduate students will suffer because fewer assistanceships
will be available if the university has to pay TAs more. Professors
will suffer because they will not have the aid they need to manage a
400-person, intro—level class. If TAs ever strike at Pitt, we all lose.

Historically, unions form for the express purpose of being able to
strike. TAs and graduate students are not forced to continue their
education. If they choose to do so, it is exactly that — a choice. If
they don’t like the conditions of their own choice, they also have
the choice to quit. ' i

I was amused a few months
ago to see a bumper sticker with
Ronald Reagan’s face upon it
and an accompanying caption
that read, “Remember when
America had a real President?" I
had to laugh at the bumper stick-
er’s attempt to imply that Reagan
was a good president. My
amusement increased when I
happened to read a speech in
George W1ll’s book The leveling
Vlfmd that the author once gave.
VV1ll’s speech was a long-winded
celebration of how wonderful the
1980s were and how great a
president Ronald Reagan was.

It didn’t bother me that Wﬂl, a
conservative lap-dog whose writ-
ings about Reagan border on
propaganda, actually believed his
own rhetoric. Instead, what did
bother me was that people have
actually accepted the notion that
the 1980s were an idyllic time
for America and that Ronald
Reagan was anything but a fail-
ure as president.

Most Reaganites typically
become angry at charges that
they belong to the party of the
rich and privileged and that their
economic policies benefit the
rich. However, of the tremen-
dous growth in income that con-
servatives boast of during the
1980s, a whopping 70 percent of
that growth went to America’s
richest one percent.

While most Reaganites may
argue that every American ‘is
now well off as'a result of
Reagan’s policies, the facts of the
matter are as clear as day: During
the 1980s the richest one percent
saw their incomsdouble, while
the poorest one-fifth saw their
wages and income drop 10 per-
cent. The Congressional Budget
Office says that in 1980 the rich-
est one-fifth of Americans had
eight times the money of the
poorest one-fifth. By 1989 that
disparity had increased to 20 to
one. Facts don’t lie.

When asked about the trillions
of dollars Americans owe in
debt, Reaganites typically blame
the Democrat-controlled
Congress for that debt, an argu-

Michael
Berqurst

ment defies common sense. In
1985 Reagan submitted a budget
to Congress that contained $588
billion dollars in spending.
Congress appropriated $583 bil-
lion, ﬁve billion less than Reagan
wanted. If Reagan was trying to
cut the budget over Congress’s
objections, than why is it that
Congress was doing the cutting
and Reagan was doing the
spending? Richard Ben Cramer
wrote in his book What It Takes
about the 1985 budget: “Reagan
kept saying the deficit was
Public Enemy Number One. But
then he sent up a budget that
would have pumped red ink up
over the window sills. It was a
laughingstock!”

Reagan himself was an incom-
petent leader who lacked the
ability to understand the most
basic concepts of how the gov-
ernment works. For example, in
1985 Senators Barry Goldwater
and Sam Nunn came to meet
with him to discuss the effect
that the then recently passed
Gramm-Rudman law, which
forced the government to make
across-the-board cuts when
Congress and the president
couldn’t agree on a balanced
budget, would have upon the
defense budget. In their meeting,

‘Secretary of Defense Casper

Weinburger complained about
Gramm-Rudman’s effect upon
the defense department. When
Senator Nunn politely pointed
out that Reagan had enthusiasti-
cally supported Gramm-
Rudman, the president piped in
that while he had supported

_ Gramm-Rudman, nobody had

ever told him that the cuts were
mandatory.

- The fact_that Reagan failed to
grasp the whole idea behind a
measure to which he had lent his

- full support is scary. Stories like

this became so common during
Reagan’s administration that
Speaker of. the House Tip
O’Neil1 remarked in sorrow, “He
knows less than any president

I’ve ever known.”

I have a question for
Reaganites: If Reagan was really
such a wonderful president, then
why is America in such terrible
shape today? Reagan supporters
may argue that Democrats in
Congress sabotaged his program
(an argument that I’ve already
proven is little more than hot-air)
or even go so far as to say_that
George Bush betrayed the

Reagan legacy.
If that is true, then it is a star-
tling admission by the

Reaganites —— that his legacy
-was so weak that it didn’t even
survive the administration of a
conservative Republican. If
Reaganomics were really so pop-
ular, then why didn’t Democrats
hop onto the “me too” bandwag-
on and endorse supply-side eco-

nomics much like the
Rockefeller Republicans
endorsed the New Deal?

Also, why have so many econ-
omists (liberal and conservative)
studied supply-side economics
and dismissed it, as Stanford
economist Paul Krugrnan has, as
little more than a cartoonishly
simple gimmick? If
Reaganomics were so wonderful
for every American, then why
did median family income (the
index that measures the income
of the typical American family)
slow down dramatically during
the 1980s from 2.5% in the years
following World War II to just
-0.4% between 1979 and 1989?

Conservatives are in denial

- and need to accept the fact that

the 19805 were a disaster for
America. Under Reagan, the
United States went from being
the world’s biggest creditor
nation to being the world’s
biggest debtor nation.
Conservatives don’t want to
admit it, but during the 1980s the
rich got richer, the poor got poor-
er and America’s middle—class
watched as its living standards
began a slow, gradual decline
that continues today. I

Wrestlers grapple for fourth place

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team opened
the 1995-96 regular season with
an impressive 8-2 record. The
1996 postseason has started out
just as well.

Six Pitt wrestlers finished
among the top three in their
respective weight classes at the
Eastern Wrestling League

win the finals at 142 pounds,
defeating West Virginia’s Dorian
Hager, 3-1.’

‘“That’s the third time they’ve
wrestled this year. J .J . won all
three, but they went to overtime
twice, and the other was a 4-3
decision. We were expecting a
close match. They’re both out-
standing athletes,” Stottlemyer
said.

Pitt’s other champion was

heavyweight Pat Wiltanger. The
score of the ﬁnal match was still
tied at one after overtime when
Wiltanger decided to shock the
coaches. -
“We all huddled up, and he said,
.‘I’m going to be a father.’ Then he
went right back out to the mat for
the tiebreaker. That’s how I found
out his wife was pregnant,”
Stottlemyer said. “I was really
rooting for him in the tiebreaker

after that.”

West Virginia’s Jim Howard
won the coin toss and chose to
start from the bottom position,
giving Wiltanger the disadvantage
of trying to hold Howard on the

mat, while Howard had the easier 

task of trying to escape. Wiltanger
managed to ride out the period,
earning his first EWL champi-
onship after three consecutive

was all set to ﬁll this column
spot with 100 percent accurate
redictions concerning the

NCAA tournament starting today.
But after reading a survey in

College Sports I had to switch
gears. The magazine polled 15 of
the 25 candidates who are in the
running for the Wooden Award.

The one response that stuck out
in my mind was 93 percent of the
players said they think college
athletes should be paid

And they’re not the ﬁrst to sup-

‘ port such a ludicrous notion.

ESPN’s in-house basketball

guru Dick Vitale has expressed a
. belief that his college hardwood
heroes should get paychecks.

.First of all, college hoopsters

3 get a scholarship. That means a

free, four-year education. A n d

that free degree is even more
important when you consider that
"an overwhehning majority of col-
lege basketball players don’t
make it in the pros. They’re going
to need the education when they
hit the real world.

After that, there is a plethora of

. unanswerable questions.

-Who would pay them? Would
it come from a portion of ticket
sales, or “friends of the program?”

Do they need to sign contracts,
and if so, do they get agents? ,

-Are the contracts good for just
one season or all four or ﬁve?

But the most important ques-
tion: Would only revenue sport
athletes get paid?

It is conceivable that Pitt’s foot-
ball and basketball programs
could generate enough money to
pay their players. But I don’t think

A Kirk Bruce would have an easy
time dishing out the cash for the
Lady Panthers.

Overall, there’s no fair way of
paying college athletes and any
attempt at goveming a pay system
would foolishly add to the already
bureaucratic workings of the
NCAA.

Although if colleges could pay
athletes based on their on-court
performance, there would be a
cash surplus at the Pitt hoops
headquarters.

Pitt tied a school record for the

In one of the nation’s toughest

Stevens leads Gymnaststo first road win

By Nichole Gantshar
Staﬂ‘ Writer —

Brenda Stevens led Pitt in its ﬁrst road victory to earn the East Atlantic
Gymnastics League’s Gymnast of the Week Stevens claimed the title by
placing in three of four events and racking up a career-high, 11:
all—around score of 38.25.

Pitt ews e Photo
Brenda Stevens topped her previous all-around record
against William *& Mary and James Madison last weekend.

The Lady Panthers’ 189.475, over host Wﬂliarn & Mai-y’s 186.3 and
James Madison’s 183.05, restored the team’s conﬁdence after a disappoint-
ing loss at-the North Carolina Invitational at the start of Spring Break

Stevens’ all-around score topped a record she set at the North Carolina
meet. Her strong showing also says a lot about her comeback from an
ankle injury eariier this season She still sutfers from tendinitis.

“I think she spends more time in the training room then she does in the
gym,” said Head Coach Debbie Yohmarr

The recognition from EAGL, the gyrrmastic division equivalent of Big
East or Atlantic 10, doesn’t mean that much to Stevens. She just cares
about the team score.

“My goals areteam goals,” said Stevens. "Iliis is my best year as part of
the team. I’ll be happy if the team does well and if I do well, then that’s
great”

Stevens takes time to stress that ﬁeshmen Erika Flamer came in third
(35.075) in the all-around. Stevens also points out that teammate
Michaelene Myers tied with her on the vault for ﬁrst place with a score of
9.7.

do well on the ﬁrst two events, but we wanted to start off strong.” Vault 5
was the ﬁrst event. .

Pitt’s vault scores were part of the team’s tum-around on the road. Vault
has been a weak event for the squad Yet in Virginia, Pitt took four of the
top ﬁve slots. In addition to the Myers and Stevens tie, sophomore Calli
Bodnar and Flamer tied for third with 9.55. William and Mary’s Tarrirny
Antoskev ﬁnished second with 9.625.

“Our vaults were excellent at William & Mary,” said Yohman.

‘The whole team felt really good about the meet because it was our
highest away score,” said Stevens. “That’s the second-closest we’ve been
to a 190. Everyone had a good meet.”

The team’s achievement assures them of a spot at the NCAA Regionals

in April, and to Stevens proves that the team has learned to focus and ‘

comeback ,

Pitt’s focus was further tested on the beam. Junior Lori Buck injured her-

The first time I fingered a
girl, I was drugged out of my
mind at an Ecstasy test in
Shadyside. I took Ecstasy with
four of my girlfriends, an expe-
rience |’d anticipated for some
time. We snorted some
cocaine that night, and
smoked kind bud. The coke
and weed had a minor impact
on our night in comparison to
the Ecstasy. We all became
closer friends that night -—
especially Kay and I.

Spring of my freshman year,
my roommate Dawn, a regular
Kelly Bundy, shared an

    
  
 
  

Ecstasy experience she
recently had with me. She
briefed me on how high and
sexually active she was that
evening. There was something
about how she spoke of its
promises of liberation and sex-
ual power that excited me. I
wanted to know what would
surface when I stripped myself
of my inhibitions. I’ve always
been intrigued by the idea of
messing around with another
woman, but never considered
myself bisexual. I wanted to
take it on the perfect night and
with the right people. On that
night I’d let my suppressed
desires pour out like red, red
wine.

That autumn my friend Kay
moved back to Pittsburgh after
her wild and brief excursion to
Los Angeles. She came back
too late to register for classes,
jobless and penniless. Kay
was not worried about how
she was going to pay her rent;
she brought back plenty of
Ecstasy she knew she’d have
no trouble selling. I was so
excited when she told about
her little fortune. We decided
that we would have an Ecstasy
party.

Kay and I loaded up on the
drugs and wine and invited our
3 best girlfriends over to join
us. We ate our Ecstasy at
about 7 p.m. and began our

’ . long and lustful fall -evening. I

was curious to find ‘out what I

hotography by James Knox

would unleash, but was scared
to find out that I was a bisexual
or a lesbian. The Ecstasy took
effect slowly. My first reaction
was an extreme feeling of
closeness to my friends. I felt
as though I could tell them
anything. I felt so close to
them that any immediate sepa-
ration would be unbearable.
Doctors term this overwhelm-
ing emotional closeness expe-
rienced while on Ecstasy
Empathogenesis. From the
time we took it, till.Kay and I
were humping each other, I
couldn’t imagine being sepa-
rated from these people.
Whenever we moved from
room to room, it was as if we
were moving through different
worlds. Everything felt so
much more significant. At one
point I went upstairs to piss —
the first piss on Ecstasy is
p r e t t y

harsh. My senses
were in overdrive and the
release of the urine from my
bladder felt like a long-awaited
orgasm. I pulled myself togeth-
er and finished the bathroom
ordeal (I didn’t bother looking
in the mirror for fear of getting
lost), and began down the
stairs. The Ecstasy was now at
full throttle. The stairs were
made of marshmallows and I
was lightly floating down them
with my feet barely touching
the steps. At that moment, I
wanted every walk down the
steps to be as soft and sensu-
al as this journey.

The girls and I talked,
danced, cried and shared an
incredible evening together. It
wasn’t until about 3 a.m. that
what I had been anticipating
occurred. Kay and I were the

 

only ones still getting off on the

Ecstasy. I could feel myself
getting excited about our emo-
tional closeness. Kay is a
beautiful girl and I wanted to
know what it was like to be
with someone so pretty. Guys
are not beautiful like women
are. I was ready_to explore this
sexual curiosity, to find out
what it was like. The Ecstasy

‘could be my excuse. We

talked about messing around
with each other before we did
anything (which was real
strange), but then took the
plunge. I knew Kay would be
into it. She ioldme before that
she fooled around with girls.

  
  
  
  

We kissed each other and
explored each other’s bodies
well into the morning.‘ It was
the softest and most sensual
thing I’d ever experienced.

Kay and I never again got
together after that, although I
think she would have liked to.
The experience was stimulat-
ing, but my curiously had been
fulfilled. The Ecstasy did bring
out curiosities I had been
neglecting, but it did not bring
me to any dramatic realization
about myself. After that night I
felt more secure with the
“kinkier” side of myself and
realized that I didn’t need to
drop Ecstasy every time I
wanted to explore these
desires.

I Xed for the second time in
Amsterdam last year. I was
more mature and had less
expectations. I was no longer
as curious about sex with
women, but there. were other
desires that I wasn't fully
recognizing. Being in
‘Amsterdam, I smoked

about 5 joints of

some wicked super

skunk and ate 2
space cakes after I
dropped the Ecstasy. I felt
so funky and at peace with
myself. Everything in the city
seemed to be wondrously
beautiful and the people were
incredible. I felt like touching
everyone and everything.

I went to the Vincent van
Gogh Museum, spawning my
obsession with him. Walking
though the museum, listening

to all the languages and
watching all the people made
me really appreciate life. When
I saw the naked picture of Sien
entitle Sorrow, I longed to be
her. I wanted to be Vincent’s
naked model, at his mercy and
willing to do anything he want-
ed. I was feeling really
masochistic and longed to be
at anyone’s mercy. I walked
back to the youth hostel hop-
ing I would meet some Dutch
guy who would take me home
and tie me up — but no such
luck. My. desire to be tied up
and fucked really hard was just
out of control. I thought about
heading to the Red Light
District, but there are mostly
women there, and I’d already
done that scene. I realized
then that I had a masochistic
that I was neglecting. There’s
no shame in being spanked
every once in a while.

With each time I’ve Xed, my
self-realizations have
decreased. The most recent
time I dropped was with Dave.
Although it was the most
intense, I didn’t come to any
revelations about myself.

The Ecstasy I took this
Valentine’s Day with Dave was
really strong. He came over
with red wine and the Ecstasy.
He offered me both — how
could I refuse? Almost immedi-
ately after I took it, the night
intensified. I revealed feelings
and fantasies to him that were
really personal and apparently
turned him on. Before I even

had time to think about it,

 

Dave and I were emerged in
passion. He was really aggres-
sive with me. He grabbed the
back of my head so hard at
times, I thought he was going
to rip the hair out of my head. I
was beginning to regret what I
wished would happen to me in
Amsterdam. We eventually
maneuvered our way from the
couch to the floor where he
pulled my pants off ever-so
quickly and smoothly. He ate
me out for a good half hour;
my senses were on fire. I was
definitely peaking at this point,
in more ways than one. At that
moment I thought I had found
Ecstasy. It was the best oral
sex I'd had in a long time. We
didn’t fuck that night, but
everything else imaginable
was explored. Now he keeps
calling me wanting me to come
over so he can tie me up.

I really liked Dave, but the
whole evening was a little too
heavy for me. I don’t really feel
comfortable around him know-
ing all I revealed to him both
mentally and physically.
Although I’ve gotten a lot out
of Ecstasy, I think my last
experience on Ecstasy will be
just that — my last experience.
I explored curiosities I’ve long
been neglecting. I'm more
mature and confident enough
now to explore these curiosi-
ties on my own. A little Special
K couldn’t hurt, either.

When one thinks of contem-
porary freejazz sax giants,
John Zorn usually tops the
list, with an honorable men-
tion going to Tim_ Berne.
Without a doubt, both of these
musicians are geniuses. Add
Ken Vandermark to the list.

If Vandermark’s name is
unfamiliar, it's not because
he’s new to the scene. He’s
paid dues and has worked
with such groups as the NRG
Ensemble (the late great Hal
FlusseI|’s band) on Calling All
Mothers, the Flying
Luttenbachers and his own
killer quartet who released an
album last year entitled Solid
Action. Truth be told, the

Chicago horn man has been _‘

involved in so many projects
that the list wouldbe endless.
Recently, Vandermarkﬂput

    

together a group called the
Steel Wool Trio which has
just released an album, The
International Front. This
dynamic ensemble features
longtime Vandermark side- .
man Kent Kessler on bass

(NRG and Vandermark
Quartet) and Curt Newton on
drums (Debris). Probably the
most striking aspect of the
band and the recording is the
balance of compositional pre-
cision and reckless impro-
visatory abandon. The com-
positions at times are quite
demanding, but this complexi-
ty is always met with dead on
accuracy. Vandermark’s com-
positions are not only mature,
but inventive. When players
do improvise, they FLY off the
handle —-1.00% passion and
virtuosityi The Steel Wool is a

perfect happy medium
between the more organized
NRG and the ultra-chaotic
Flying Luttenbachers,
embodying the best charac-
teristics from both extremes.
Not surprisingly, International
Front has been on WPTS’ top
ten jazz list since its arrival to
the station. »
What’s even more impres-
sive about the band is that it’s
coming to Pittsburgh along
with Debris (I guess Newton
will really be earning his
money) and getting plenty of
local support from Watershed.
This is a show not to be
missed and a great scenario
to see one of the most talent-
ed reed players of out time.
The show is this Saturday,
March 16th at the Morewood
Gardens Cafeteria (CMU) on
the corner of Forbes and
Morewood. The show starts
promptly at 8PM so don’t be
late. Thank Doug, WFICT,
and the CMU activities fee for
this one! "

Lane, Gene Hackman, and
Dianne Wiest

Directed by Mike Nichols

A remake of the French film,
La Cage aux Fol/es (1978),
The Birdcage, is the story of a
gay couple having to “straight-
en-up” their act for their son's
fiancee’s visiting parents.

Nathan Lane plays Albert by
day, transvestite club-singer
Starina by night. He “swishes”
when he walks, calls himself
the wife of the relationship and
is generally an “obvious”
homosexual. Robin Williams
plays his partner (we’re never
told if they are really married),
Armand, the straighter, more
restrained of the two. He owns

. the nightclub where Starina

performs and above which
they live (called The Birdcage).
It is Armand’s son, Val, who
comes home to visit.

He arrives with some stress-
ful news for his father and
“auntie Albert.” He is going to
be getting married. To a girl.
Armand doesn’t like the idea,

m 

but he eventually softens up.

The complications arise when
his fiancee’s parents want to
visit their daughter’s future in-
laws.

Gene Hackman plays the
fiancee’s (Barbara) father,
Senator Keeley. He is one of
the founders of a group to
restore “moral order” to the
United States. Trouble erupts
on the home front when the
president of this “moral” group
dies in the arms of a prostitute
who isn’t even 18. The press
finds out about the details and
stakes out Keeley’s house for
information. To avoid further
embarrassment, his wife
(Dianne Wiest) suggests that
they meet Barbara’s future in-
laws to escape the press and
also to plan a huge, traditional,
Catholic, wedding to restore
the nation’s confidence in her
husband’s position. Their
daughter lies to them about
Armand and Albert.

When the news reaches Val
in South Beach, Florida, at his
father’s, he isn't sure what he
should do. He can't have the
founder of a group concerned
with the moral condition of the
U.S. coming into the house of

two gay men. He decides to
have his father redecorate the
house to make it more mascu-
line and suggests “getting rid”
of Albert for the weekend.
Armand is offended, but
because it is his son, he oblig-
es. He does everything his son
wants, except sending Albert
away. Chaos ensues when the
senator’s family arrives at the
house.

The film is very funny, filled
with sight gags, homosexual
and heterosexual jokes and
even a little slapstick. Hank
Azaria as Agador, the
maid/butler, steals the show in
all respects. He is seen in tight

‘ shorts and a bra singing along

to Gloria Estefan, cleaning the
pool in a g-string and falling
flat on his face when he is told
to wear shoes. He also has a
falsetto Spanish accent, which
makes whatever he says hilari-
ous.

Robin Williams is very
restrained in this picture. His
normal over-the-top energy
and humor is toned down per-
fectly by Nichols.-The only time
it is unleashed, it is very awk-
ward and doesn’t seem? to
quite fit in. Nathan Lane is the
other high point. Straight from
the stage and Nyquil commer-
cials, Lane shows he can act
with the best in film. He pulls at
our heart strings and at our
funny bones. '

Some of the less funny parts
are a couple of the jokes left

over from the original film.The
Birdcage sticks rather close to
its predecessor in terms of
content, and situation, but
sometimes it seems as though
it shouldn’t have. For instance,
Senator Keeley’s political ally
was found in bed with a black
prostitute. It wasn’t enough to
make a big deal out of her
being a minor and a prostitute
—.she had to be black, and we

were supposed to sympathize.
Nichols sort of redeems him-
self when he puts the senator
in drag and makes him dance
to a Village People song.

The movie is really about
what is generally referred to as

“family values” told simply from"

another angle. it is a very

funny film, worthy of being

compared to the original.

I’m sorry to say that l
haven’t yet heard Davenport,
but i trust Mr. Trbovich’s
opinion, and he assures that
they’ve got what it takes to
rock with the big boys, and
that’s important, because
everyone knows that its a
long way to the top if you
wanna rock n’ roll. This

The name Trans Am invokes

a certain image of a poor
design of American automo-
bile ingenuity, although this is
‘not what I am referring to.
They are an instrumental
band, which brings up images
of Don Cabellero, but they're
mellow, which conjures
images of Tortoise. Okay!
They share a mutual record
label, Thrill Jockey, and both
play elegant melodious music,
but Trans Am will be in
Pittsburgh and Tortoise will
not. _

Trans Am’s self-titled, full-
length debut is an exercise of
intricate musical arrangements
that reflect ambiguous emo-
tions. “A Single Ray of Light
on an Otherwise Cloudy Day”
(sounds like a Smiths’ title)
can be characterized as a
musical interpretation of
Jackson Pollack’s Number 9
with an explosion of sound
here and there, and everything
else let loose as the inspiration
hits them. '

JB will be forfeiting his
Friday show so that Trans Am
can perform live on WPTS
92.1 FM around 2 o'clock. This
is just a general time, so if I'm
wrong you can give me a real-
ly bad indian burn (on my wrist
only!)

Hurl and Master Mechanic
will be opening the late show

Friday at Cloud 9. Over-21.

‘ nglophiles in Pee-Dee '5 Playhouse

Velocity Girl

Glided Stars and Zea/ous
Hearts

Subpop

Velocity Girl are strange but
not dangerous. Their latest
album Glided Stars and
Zea/ous Hearts is a cogent
dressing of ‘80s pop songs

with an unpretentious b-what-'

you-want-to-be ‘90’s attitude.
The band pays tribute to

three prolific ‘80s bands, New-

Order, Echo and The
Bunnymen and The Pastels,
on two singles between the
releases of Simpatico! and
Glided Stars and Zea/ous

’ Hearts and many starched crit-

ics are writing “Anglophiles!
Anglophiles! Anglophi|es!” Just
because Madonna wore white
and a rosary didn’t qualify her
as a virgin, and just because

‘ ' Velocity Girl play with a pen-

chant for distortion doesn’t
make them Brit wanna—bes.
The trans-Atlantic music style
of Velocity Girl is a melodic
illustration with colors of fuzzy
guitar and highlights of vocals,
which makes them undeniably
cute.

Even though the band has
received some flack for giving
Volkswagen automobile rights
to use “Sorry Again” as back-
ground music, they move on;
which is a testament to the
unsullied, timeless nature of
their art rather than an indica-
tlon of stylistic stagnation
where many bands drift into —
they can quit their day jobs
and live off their music.

Copacetic the band recorded
in ten days with Bob Weston,
Simpatico! was recorded in 20
days with John Porter, and

Gilded tars and Zalos

Hearts with Clif Norrell, who
helped with REM’s Automatic
For The People, spent seven
weeks recording the band. ‘‘I
can’t imagine how we ever did
it in less than a month,” says
vocalist Sarah Shannon. “This
time we had time to experi-
ment with things and make
sure we got it right.” And they

. did!

“Same Old City” is a countri-
fied lullaby with slide-guitar. lt’s
kinda nostalgic to imagine
being on a dude ranch and
filming family events with

. Super-8, because everything

seems copacetic.

The first single, “Nothing,” is
a continuing example that
Velocity Girl can write top-
quality ebullient pop. “Gilded
Stars,” “Go Coastal” and
“Finest Hour” are all-out pop

numbers, catchy riff and infec-

tious lyrics.
A notable difference.
between previous releases is

There is a picture of an out-
of-control mine car, flying off
the tracks, roller-coaster style,
on the cover of “Dig,” the
almost-brand-new Steel Miners
10-inch. To me, this represents
the Miners themselves, hot on
the heels of the Mount
McKinleys “Portrait of A
Mindbender” LP, burnin’ up the
Burgh with real life PUNK
ROCK, whilst simultaneously
trying not to run themselves
over in the process with the
release of their brand-newest

titled “Al| Hopped Up.” lt’s guar-
anteed to make all the kiddies
shake their scantly clad PUNK

The Steel Miners consist of

Eric Vermillion, and Matt.Frank
on drums, with all three mem-
bers singing their black lungs
out on their respective songs.

Ryko Disc

Golden Smog is a cool
band. Its first effort, Down by
the Old Mainstream, is a play-
ful, well-crafted collaboration

 

between several singer/song-
writers. And the amazing thing
is that none of the members of
the band actually exist. In fact,
Golden Smog isn’t even a
band. Golden Smog is, well,
sort of a gag. The music is
good, but the joke is on you.

disbanded), Jeff Tweedey of
Wilco and Dave Priner of Soul
Asylum, as well as a number
of other grunge-folk hipsters.
Golden Smog is the Spinal
Tap of Country Grunge. It is a
garage band gone awry. The
album’s 14 songs range from
raunchy rock to subtle country’
to simple folk. The faux album
liner boasts such fictitious past
Golden Smog albums as
Temple of the Smog. All of the
names of the musicians that
appear on the liner notes are
fake (and pretty funny, too 
check ‘em out if you buy the
disc). Like I said, the album is
kind of a joke. So why listen?
Well, it’s good, that’s why.

If you like bands like Wilco,
Sonvolt, Blue Mountain, Uncle
Tupelo and Soul Asylum, you
will like Golden Smog. Now
that the Jayhawks are a thing
of the past, Gary Louris, axe-
man extraordinaire, has taken
off in new directions. Much of
the Golden Smog album
sounds like a post-Jayhawks
lament. Louris’ songs are
sweet and, attimes, biting. His
voice is sugary and steady and

 

works well with his composi-
tions. Tweedey also makes
some nice contributions to the
album with an old Uncle
Tupelo song from his days in
that defunct outfit as well as a
couple of new tunes. Priner
lays down some nice vocals
on a track of two.

But the real surprise of the
album is a guy who is, as of
yet, unknown to me. Since no
real names appear on the
album, I don’t know who he is,
but songs like “Yesterday
Cried” and “He’s a Dick” are
some of the best cuts on the
disc. They are well-crafted
folksy pieces with depth and
humor.

“He’s a Dick” is one of the
funniest songs I have heard in
a while. With lyrics like ‘‘I won-
der what makes guys like him
tick/he’s such a dick,” you
can’t help but crack a smile,
and the tune just makes you
want to sing along. And this
guy’s voice is great  gravely
and shakey. It is kind of remi-
niscent of Tonight's the Night-
era Neil Young. If you are a
sucker for the heartfelt sinceri-

hear this guy’s songs.

Other tracks are good, but
none really stand up as well as
the aforementioned tracks,
with the possible exception of
the rollicking fun “Red Headed
Stepchild.” But the real treat of
the Golden Smog is this
unidentified songwriter. I just
want to find out who the heck

 

this guy is, and I want to hear '

more from him. Until then, I

Three Tall Women

Written by Edward Albee
Directed by Susan Einhorn

Paying tribute to the stamina
and strength of three genera-
tions of women, Pulitzer Prize
winner Edward Albee presents
a cynical analysis of growing
old. The play centers around a
wealthy 92-year-old elder who
continuously proclaims senile
reminisces of past experi-
ences. The other middle-aged
woman is her caretaker, and
the young woman in her twen-
ties is a lawyer’s. assistant sent
to coax money from the old
bureaucrat. None of the char-
acters have names, and there
is never a reference to any
specific time or place. The
anonymous reflection of char-
acters focuses around the fear

0 c ange an t e iscovery o
reality.

Each character accomplish-
es their complex roles with
grace and versatility. Annie
Murray plays the eldest woman
fascinated with the regression
of life. Using sharp wit and
heartfelt tears, Murray portrays
her role as a strong sage sit-
ting on the edge of death. Her
old-fashioned use of racist
slang aggravates the youngest
actress, Linda Marie Larson,
who grows fierce with impa-
tience. Larson is a liberal yup-
pie whoirefuses to accept the
wrinkled face of age. The mid-
dle-aged character, Nancy
McDoniel, provides a bitter bal-
ance between spicy youth and
the deteriorating sanity of
growing old. McDoniel is con-
stantly forced to translate
Murray’s ramblings into logic.
The turbulent voice of distrust

an mendacity erupts emotion-
al monologues from all actress-
es in the Second Act. The
actresses become ghosts of
Murray’s past life. The stories
that each generation shares
piece together the tangents
that took place in the first act.
The search for peace of mind
becomes motivational desire.
Each woman stands tall and
is determined to withstand a
degree of class. However, this
inspiration does not allow them
to escape the slimy wrath of
men. Struggling to be a lady
amongst poverty can shatter
happy clichés and dreams that
bring about pain and tragedy.
The message of the play deep-
ens into a dark warning of age
until Murray examines her life
meticulously to conclude that
the happiest moment of her life
is when it comes to an end.

The roller coaster of life fosters

our lives with different faces.
The characters realize that
they were different people at
particular times in their lives.
Change is inevitable and so is
death‘. We die every day.
Discovering the meaning of
life may be in the acceptance
of change as this play sug-
gests. The tears and sweat of
life are not always in our con-
trol. Standing tall and proud

Ring certainly deliver, satisfying
the expectations of anyone ir
search of tasty melodies and 2
little fuzz to rock out with.

The Promise Ring (frorr
Milwaukee, Wis.) boast a
unique talent for self-restraint
offering up tasty, almost loungy
poppy riffage. Indeed, they
admit to being into “pop hooks

and good looks.” But The"

Promise Ring can also explode
the tension they delicately cre-
ate with their spangly melodies
The overall effect is well-inte-
grated songwriting that makes
you say “Damn.”

The first track, “A Picture
Postcard,” starts with a pippy
poppy happy riff with a very
relaxed feel. A tasty ride cymba
accompanies reserved guital
and strangely tortured vocals. I‘
is this conflict between swee'
hooks and unsettled lyrics tha
soon explodes ‘into a Seamy
fuzz attack. Make no mistake
while The Promise Ring knows
how to play in the pocket, they
also know how to rock! Just try
not to angst along with the

' Iovelorn lyric “Couldn’t you take

the second bus home?”

“Saturday” is softer and slow-
er still, almost evocative of neo-
loungers The Sea and Cake
This is music you could sip 2
drink to, soaking up the nice
harmonies and mellow riffs. Bu‘
be careful — you just may spil
your drink all over your cardi-
gan as the Ring launches intc
another loud attack towards the
end of the 2:23 song. The tracl
ends on a softer note, demon-
strating The Promise Ring’s
ability to deftly integrate theii
loud-soft-loud aesthetic seam-
lessly.

The final track, “Scenes tron
Parisian Life," at a brief 1:19
offers a smooth, short and bit-
tersweet end to a well-craftec
album of tasty pop. The
Promise Ring does well here
creating nice soundscapes tha
alternately soothe, unsettle
rock and subside. For a nice
emotional and sonic tour
Falsetto Keeps Time couldn"
get much better.

Lacrosse destrgxs hapless Washington & Jefferson, l6-2

Next, Pitt was a man up because of a W&J cross-check
penalty. It capitalized on a pass from Mike Tanniru to Rob
Heaps. On this play, Pitt made several passes around the
perimeter before the two top men‘ ran towards the goal.
Heaps left his spot in front of the goal and curled out to the
point where he received the pass for the open shot.

“It was a set play we have, and that time it worked to per-
fection,” said Tanniru. I

The third goal of the game came on an individual effort by
Pat Shea. He received the ball on the right side with a
defender on him. He faked left towards the middle of the
ﬁeld and spun right, which left him open for a bounce shot
and a 3-0 Pitt lead

W&J scored next on one of its few possessions of the
quarter, making it 3-1. ,

Then, Mark Polecritti scored oif his own inbounds. He
brought the ball in from the left side and raced to the goal
before the defender could check him.

The second quarter started with a Pitt power play.
Showing patience again, Pitt made 11 passes before taking a
shot, but a defender caught the shot. Shea then checked the

The men’s lacrosse team showed side effects of the 10-
day hiatus in the early moments of its game against
Washington and Jefferson College. Although it dominated
the ﬁrst period, it only had a 4-2 lead on the inexperienced
squad.

The team then sanded off the rust and scored 12 unan-
swered goals, pummeling its opponent 16-2 last Tuesday at
the Cost Center.

“We were really sloppy after a week off. People were
dropping balls and not hustling,” said attacker Dave Walter.

“We basically won the game off their mistakes. We started
slow and then played better in the third and fourth quarters,”
said captain John Foris.

After a couple of Pitt misﬁres in the ﬁrst two possessions,
Bret Meyer-Kincak scored the first goal of his hat trick when
he caught a pass at the point and then used his wide body to
shield the ball from a defender. After gaining a step on the
defense, he scored on a bormce shot, giving Pitt a 1-0 lead.

The awards and accolades continue to pile up for
one of Pitt’s most accomplished athletes, women’s
track and field star Najuma Fletcher.

Fletcher, a l4—time All-American and 15-time Big
East champion, was voted the USCTA Indoor Female
Track Athlete of the Year, announced yesterday.

“This award is voted on by all the collegiate coach-
es,’? Head Coach Steve Lewis said. “It actually
’ r   occurred at the national championships.”

Fletcher won her second national championship
last Saturday when she placed first in the high jump
at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships
in Indianapolis, Ind. She won the event with a leap of
6 3/4.

She placed fourth in the triple jump withla distance

ball loose and Meyer-Kincak scooped up the loose ball and
scored on the surprised goalie, giving the team a 5-2 lead

Dave Walter continued the banage of goals a few seconds
later. Shea made a long pass to Walter in the middle, who
spun off a check from behind and scored the first of his four
goals, giving Pitt the edge 6-2.

Goals by Tanniru, Meyer-Kincak and Polecritti pushed
the lead to 9-2 at the half time intermission.

‘The defense started slow in the ﬁrst half, and the offense
started fast. That was asurprise, because it usually takes time
for the offense to get started. They started quickly; then the
defense picked it up in the second quarter,” said Foris.

Behind the stick handling and checking of Foris, Mike
Domboski, Tom Evans and Brian Novnety, the Panthers
held W&J to fewer than ﬁve shots on goal.

On one play, Novnety crushed an attacker into the carpet,
freeing the ball for Foris to scoop. up and go downﬁeld lead-
ing the fast break, which gave Pitt another scoring chance.

“The defense shut them down. They really never were
able to get set up on olfense. We are going to pressure them
from start to finish,” said Head Coach Gary Nelf.

Fletcher soars to another NCAA title

have to remember that she went up against the top 14
in the country, and three of them were national cham-
pions.” .

Fletcher also added an eighth-place performance in
the long jump event.

Two other Lady Panthers made the trip to
Indianapolis. Junior Angie Martin placed ninth in her
heat of the 800 meter with a time of 2:13.39. She
didn’t qualify for the finals.

“Angie didn’t run her best race,” Lewis said. “Last
year she was an All-American.”

Freshman Trecia Smith qualiﬁed for the NCAAs in
her first season of college competition. She placed
16th in the triple jump with a distance of 41-1 1/4.

This weekend, Pitt opens its 1996 outdoor season
at the Jamaica Relays. This tournament isn’t for just
anybody. ‘

“There are only eight American schools being
invited to participate,” Lewis said. “It’s some great
competition.”

Najuma Fletcher won the NCAA indoor high jump.
