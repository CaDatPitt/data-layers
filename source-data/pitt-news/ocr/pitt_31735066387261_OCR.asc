Harmon
resigns

for UVA
position

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

William Harmon, Pitt’s
vice chancellor for Student
Affairs since 1990, resigned
last week to accept a position
as vice president for student
affairs at the University of
Virginia in Charlottesville
effective August 15.

According to Harmon, Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor was aware of the
move.

“Virginia is a school I
always had an interest in,”
Harmon said. “They offer
some things from a tradition-
al standpoint, which I feel are
important academically.”

Harmon is credited with
playing a major role in
the establishment of a com-
puter laboratory at the univer-
sity’s Learning Skills Center
which addresses the educa-
tional needs of disabled stu-
dents and will open in
September.

Fraudulent
data found
at eleven

institutions

By John B. Moore

Washington, D.C. — Eleven
out of the nearly 500 institu-
tions involved in the federal-
ly-funded National Surgical
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project were found to have
discrepancies by University
‘of Pittsburgh auditors.
Failure to achieve proper
inform consent, failure to
maintain proper drug logs
and failure toprovide accu-
rate data were among the
problems reviewed at
Wednesday’s U.S. House of
Representatives
Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigation hearing.
Reports of research fraud at
Luc’s Hospital in
Montreal sparked inquiries in
March 1994 into the reliabili-
ty of data at other research
institutions. At that time, the
National Cancer Institute
requested patient recruitment
be halted and NSABP Chair

 

He also served as chair of
the Campus Public Safety
Task Force which resulted in
an improved on and off-cam-
pus shuttle transportation sys-
tem for members of the Pitt
community. In addition, more
than $200,000 worth of lights
have been installed to
increase the safety of stu-
dents.

“Bill Harmon has been a
vital part of the university’s
administration,” O’Connor

Harmon reflects on his tenure at Pitt and the future

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

On August 15, William Harmon will
leave the University of Pittsburgh to
become vice president for student affairs
at the University of Virginia, four years
after being named Pitt’s vice chancellor
for Student Affairs. 1

Reflecting on those years in an inter-
view yesterday, Harmon talked about his
experience here and how he thinks Pitt
can improve its atmosphere for students.

“Pitt needs improved services for grad-
uate students,” Harmon said, “specifical-
ly, housing is an issue.”

Harmon was involved in a major hous-

ing project during his tenure at Pitt. The
construction of Sutherland Hall, a 612-
bed facility with a cafeteria and computer
lab, was completed, marking the first resi-
dence hall construction in Oakland since
the 1950s.

He also said the quality of the under-
graduate experience could also be
improved. .

“We want to make sure students have a
positive experience [at Pitt] and not just
purely in the academic sense,” Harmon
said. “We need improved recreational
facilities. For instance, right now there
are no outdoor tennis courts.”

Harmon said in order to compete with
other quality institutions, Pitt will need to

take a serious look at these improvements
in the future.

“Right now, students are taking a con-
sumer approach when looking at a univer-
sity — ‘If you don’t provide the services
we need, someone else will,”’ Harmon
said. Harmon said, however, that Pitt is
not losing students because of services
which are not currently provided.

“I think, by and large, good students
will still come to Pitt because of its acad-
emic reputation. but there are other areas
we must be sensitive of in providing a
total university experience,” he said.

Harmon said he counted his relation-
ship with students as his best personal

hopeful that talks could proceed
with North Korea over the

that country would be willing to

His comment came after for-
mer President Jimmy Carter

At the same time, South
Korea asked North Korea for

Nicosia, Cyprus — Seventy
people are dead and more than
100 injured after a bomb
exploded Monday in a crowded
mausoleum in the Iranian city
of Mashad.

The Iranian news agency
(IRNA) said they did not know
who was responsible for the
attack.

IRNA said mourners ﬂock to
the mausoleum every year to
commemorate the martyrdom
of Imam Hussein, Prophet
Mohammad’s grandson and the
third Shi’ite Moslem Imam. His
death in 680 A.D. made the

Sunni tradition the dominant
form of Islam. — Reuters

Washington — The U.S.
Supreme Court brought up the
issue of congressional term lim-
its on Monday and also ruled
companies can require employ-
ees to speak only English on the
job.

The court agreed to hear an
appeal of an Arkansas Supreme
Court ruling which struck down
state—mandated term limits as
unconstitutional. .

This case is the first congres-
sional term-limit test to reach
the federal Supreme Court.

The court also ruled that a
company can require its
employees to speak only
English at work, rejecting an
appeal stating the rule violates
the federal civil rights law. -

Harrisburg — To protest the
University of Pittsburgh’s deci-
sion to extend spousal benefits
to same-sex partners of employ-
ees, a Mercer County lawmaker
threatened to cut Pitt’s state
funding by $10,000 last week.
Rep. David King, R-
Greenville, proposed cutting the
amount out of Pitt’s $139.8 mil-
lion state appropriation. But

King decided to withdraw the
amendment rather than spark a
lengthy debate.

The policy, which took effect
July 1, grants six free tuition
credits a semester, bereavement
benefitsand a university identi-
fication card to same-sex
domestic partners of Pitt
employees. — Pittsburgh Post-

Minneapolis — Debates over

University of Minnesota fol-
lowing the arrest of a street

 preacher last month.

Paul Stamm was arrested
twice, once by campus police
for disorderly conduct and once
by a student making a citizen’s
arrest. The student newspaper
reported Stamm referred to
women as “bitches” and
“whores” during his mono-
logues. '

The student who arrested
Stamm claimed that his speech
had amounted to harassment
that interfered with her right to
work on campus. Others say the
arrests were nothing more than
censorship. — The Chronicle of

Mentor program brings generations
together to help IocaI ninth-graders

By Jon Hayes
Staff Writer

In an effort to buoy the
scholastic achievement of
some local ninth—graders, the
University of Pittsburgh’s
Generations Together program
has launched a two—year men-
toring program this summer.

Adults over the age of 50
can participate in the program
as mentors for students strug-
gling with the transition from
middle school to high school.
The program is based in the
neighborhoods of St. Clair
Village, Beltzhoover and
Carrick, and will involve stu-
dents at Knoxville Middle
School and Carrick High
School

Mary-Jo Cliff, director of
Mentor Programs at

Generations Together, said
there is an alarming need to
improve academic perfor-
mance during the ninth—grade

yean

“Nearly 30 percent of ninth-
graders don’t make it to tenth
grade on time,” Cliff said, cit-
ing a study of retention rates in
Pittsburgh public schools.

“There are a lot of factors,
including peer pressure not to
achieve, that come to bear on
ninth—grade students and really
impact their performance in a
negative way.”

By participating in one—on—
one activities with students,
mentors may provide the spark
students need to succeed
through high school, Cliff said.
According to Cliff, each men-
tor would be responsible for
two students and receive a
stipend for spending five hours
a week with them.

Carrick High School
Principal Jerry Minsinger said
the mentoring program will
demand hard work and
patience from students and
mentors alike, but also said he

Salvatore

is optimistic that the program
will succeed.

“It [mentorship] has a lot of
merit. Education occurs
throughout the community, not
just within the walls of
school,” Minsinger said.

According to Cliff, older
adults possess the life skills
required of today’s high school
students, such as how to apply
for a job, time and money
management and the mainte-
nance of positive self-esteem.

“We’re not looking for
teachers. We’re looking for
people who will give the stu-
dents the kind of support so
that they can come to school
more often, be more open to
what school has to offer, per-
haps begin to believe that they
can do good quality work and
succeed,” Cliff said.

Pitt researchers study weight loss

By David Saliba
Staﬂ Writer

A program designed to better
understand the ability of individ-
uals who have experienced suc-
cessful long-term weight loss
has been established by the
National Weight Control
Registry at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

“Most of obesity research has
been based on studying people
who have failed to lose weight,”
said Rena Wing, the registry
director and executive director
of the Obesity and Nutrition
Research Center at UPMC. “We
feel it is time to study people
who have been successful at los-
ing weight.”

According to researchers, at
any one date and time at least 20

percent of Americans report
they are dieting.

Most people attempt to lose
weight on their own, but there is
little scientific information
available concerning their long-
term outcome.

“We are interested in knowing
whether the majority of people
who have come to us have even
participated in a treatment pro-
gram or whether they have [diet-
ed] on their own,” said VV1ng.

The program is available to
those who have lost 30 pounds
or more and kept off the weight
for at least a year.

“We believe it is a myth that
permanentweight loss is impos-
sible. There appears to be a
number of people who have
been able to successfully lose
weight and keep it off. Those

 .:.:.<
:~.~.\¢= 
s.

are the people we would like to
talk to,” said \V1ng.

Wing said the registry is a
treatment program and is only
for research. “Totally separate
from this research program we
do have treatment programs that
we offer that are based on our
best knowledge, at present, of
what works,” said VV1ng.

The registry is a new
approach in learning more about
what is successful in weight
loss, which will inﬂuence the
treatment program down the
road, said Wing.

Those participating in the pro-
gram will be asked to complete
questionnaires concerning their
success at losing weight and
then they will be contacted peri-
odically. All names will be kept
conﬁdential.

premise of her organization is
that intergenerational models
help meet the needs of society.
She said that she has high
aspirations for the mentoring
program and believes it is
unique because it is “one of
the only really focused pro-
grams that deals with school
transition  I do hope this
program becomes the proto-
type.”

Cliff. said she researched
school-based and community-
based intergenerational mod-
els and found that no program
offering both community and
academic opportunities cur-
rently exists.

She believes the
Generations Together mentor-
ing program is the first to
combine the two spheres.

“If we can get something
going where [the students] are
more comfortable then I think
we can move it into the school

and hopefully see the effects
of those supportive relation-
ships,” said Cliff.

Once positive relationships
are established between men-
tors and students through
activities such as going out to
breakfast, playing basketball
and video games, then stu-
dents’ interests may spill over
into the academic setting, Cliff
said.

In addition to assisting high
school students, the mentoring
program will give some older
adults a constructive outlet for
their free time, Cliff said. She
said every adult should know
“you’re a valuable resource.
You have something to offer
that someone else needs.”

Minsinger said the value of
older adults lies in the lessons
of life experience. The skills
older‘ adults possess are often
overlooked in today’s society
—— it is “a resource we have
not tapped,” he said.

contribution to Pitt.

“One thing which pleased
me was the the increased inter-
est in student government this
year,” Harmon said. As an
example, he cited the fact that
six students ran for Student
Government Board president
this year, up from two the pre-
vious year and one in 1991.
“There is an increased interest
in the overall governance
structure. These students see
an opportunity to make a dif-
ference and have a say in how

the university conducts busi-
ness.”

Harmon, who has dealt with
issues ranging from the appro-
priateness of students’ artwork
to racial issues at Pitt, said the
Housing and Food Services
scandal in 1990-1991 was
undoubtedly his worst experi-
ence here.

“There was gross misman-
agement in the department
which the students unfortu-
nately had to pay for,” Harmon
said.

Herberman said he would
characterize Louisiana State
University and Tulane
University in New Orleans, as
well as South Nassau
Communities Hospital in Long
Island, N.Y., as sloppy in the
handling of records and clini-
cal trials data. ‘

He said the types of ‘discrep-
ancies vary rather widely.
“The most serious one I would
characterize relates to
information that would affect
eligibility of patients entering
on to the trial,” Herberman
said.

“These things are all prob-
lems, there is no question
about that and I would certain-
ly like to address them as soon
as I know more about them,”
said Fisher.

Dingell said in his opening
statement that reports from
LSU and Tulane revealed seri-
ous problems of missing and
misrepresented data. “The
majority of the data at these
sites could not be located,” he
said.

Memorial Cancer Research
Foundation. Two of eight
patients at South Nassau
Communities Hospital were
reported to be eligible, but in
the audit were found to “be
clearly ineligible due to their
medical history.”

No follow—up action
occurred in these cases,
Dingell said, and in the case of

the Memorial Cancer Research
Foundation the original report
had never been sent to the NCI
or the research site. “The orig-
inal audit report was found in
a file drawer at Pittsburgh,” he
said.

“The subcommittee’s review
of hundreds of audit reports
revealed that, _in many cases,
NSABP was years behind in
performing audits and in writ-

ing up and forwarding audit
reports after the audits were
completed,” Dingell said.
“More significantly, the fol-
low—up to identified audit defi-
ciencies was all but nonexis-
tent.”

Other institutions said
to have serious problems

include St. Joseph’s in
Lancaster, Pa., Rush
Presbyterian St. Luke’s

Medical Center in Chicago
and the University of
California at Davis where
three-quarters of the patients
were ineligible.

Fisher, Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor and Vice
Chancellor of Health Sciences
Thomas Detre all accepted
responsibility for the adminis-
trative errors of the NSABP.

“I don’t think the falsifica-

able, particularly when it deals
with the public health.”
O’Connor said.

Fisher stressed, “Let me
emphasize I take full share of

est was to try to do the best

Brown asked O’Connor if Pitt planned to reim-
burse the federal government for costs associated
with generating significant amounts of useless data.

“We are going to certainly comply with all federal
guidelines,” O’Connor said Tuesday.

Fisher was also under fire for the difference in the
amount spent on annual and semi-annual scientific
meetings for project investigators compared to the
amount budgeted for auditing.

Drug—sponsored companies spent up to $80,000
per extravagant reception, just a little less than what
was budgeted for the auditing.

According to a statement made by Subcommittee
Chair John Dingell (D-Mich.), Fisher claimed dis-
crepancies found in past audits were due to a lack of

“Zeneca was providing huge amounts of money —

Too little, too late

A week after announcing his resignation from Pitt, Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs William Harmon has some sug-
gestions about ways to improve the campus.

Suggestions included improvinglgraduate housing needs,
improving the quality of life for allstudents and creating more
recreational areas.

While these ideas have merit, we must question why Harmon
waited until now instead of the four years he was here to discuss
these timely issues.

“Pitt needs improved services for graduate students.
Specifically, housing is an issue and we also have to look at the
quality of the undergraduate experience and not purely in the
academic sense,” Harmon said. “We need improved recreational
facilities. For instance, right now there are no outdoor tennis
courts.”

To the best of our knowledge Harmon did not made a notice-
able attempt to create the kinds of changes of which he recently
spoke. We realize Harmon had limited jurisdiction, but his lead-

ership on these issues would have made a significant difference

with the students and the administration.

“We have to compete with other quality institutions. Right
now students are taking a consumer approach,” he said.

Pitt’s main concern should not be those students who are look-
ing into schools as a consumer matter. Pitt should be able to sell
itself on tradition and academics and should not not have to
worry about creating new non-academic facilities to get more
students interested. 

This university has adequate facilities for our geographic
location. We do not live in a rural area that has acres of
fields, but the diverse-community we live in has modern
facilities which are very accessible. The university must
facilitate students’ interests in the community and help broaden
their lives, otherwise Pitt is basically an island with invisible
walls.

Harmon said he also sees a problem with diversity on campus.
He has seen the racial climate on campus and said the burden is
placed on students to work for diversity. _

“Diversity is often placed on the heads of the students, espe-
cially on campus, when it should be an institutional concern,”
Harmon said.

“It is the students who live diversity. Faculty and staff go
home to their own communities every night and usually those
communities can be described in ethnic terms.”

Students are responsible for diversity; however, the best way
to become diverse is for the administration and faculty to
encourage students to become more involved in the community
around them.

Harmon recognized the problems at Pitt when it was too late
for him to do anything about it.

His replacement must work on these problems in a more time-
ly fashion than Harmon chose to. ‘

Does segregation still exist?

In the ‘60s, great strides were
made by both blacks and whites
in dissipating the atmosphere of
racial intolerance in our society.
Individuals such as Dr. Martin
Luther King, Malcolm X and
John F. Kennedy made it their
struggle to create an environ-
ment where not only blacks and
whites but all races regardless
of color could live in racial har-

ing growth of separatism and
resegregation among today’s
younger generation? According
to a recent ABC news poll,
especially on college campuses,
blacks and whites are increas-
ingly and probably uncon-
sciously going back to segrega-
tion as a way of life;

Personally, I think this only
breeds miscommunication and
ignorance between whites and
blacks about their cultures.
There is nothing wrong with
wanting to be with people of

ground. It is wrong when we
allow that to overshadow our

in the South and other parts of
the country were steadily being
desegregated as blacks and
whites started to relate in a
more personal way to each
other, realizing the same
dreams, hopes and fantasies of
a better life.

Fast forward to the ‘90s,
where some of the dreams of
our parents have been fulﬁlled.
Blacks have been given access
to the right kind of education,
homes and jobs. Although there
is a lot to accomplish, whites

very uncomfortable as I
searched fora black face in the

I happily ran over and intro-

What is even more scary is
that an increasing number of

Student gives suggestions on class evaluations

After attending my first year of college, I can
look back at my classes and remember that
many.professors required class evaluations. But
one may ask to whom do these evaluations go,

and to what extent are the
responses given by students
heard and enforced? Many stu-
dents feel that they are being
denied the “right to know” how a
particular professor’s class is
viewed by other students at the
same level. This seems very
important to freshmen entering a

large university because many have not yet
learned about [which] speciﬁc teachers to take
or classes that are beneficial. The surveys that
are ﬁlled out ask the general questions such as

and text materials and difficulty of the class.

make teachers more willing to change their
teaching technique if a problem existed, and
also to [make] aware students of a particular
professor’s ability. There would, though, have to

be a restriction to the types of
questions that would be asked,
because many could abuse it.

easy class that is essentially
appealing to many students.

Providing the student body with the results of

become beneficial for everyone.

Savage Nights
Written and Directed
by Cyril Collard
With Collard,
Bohringer

and Carlos Lopez

Romane

There are no more com-
pelling fictions than the ones
immediately around us.
Writer/director Cyril Collard
has taken to this notion com-
pletely in the semi-autobio-
graphical Savage Nights.
Collard, who died of AIDS
three days before his film was
awarded four Cesars (French
Oscars), plays Jean, a bisexual
cinematographer struggling
with being HIV-positive,
caught in a bizarre love trian-
gle with the 17-year-old Laura
(Romane Bohringer) and the
machismo-heavy thrill-seeker
Samy (Carlos Lopez).

Following a string of
masochistic, anonymous sex
near underpasses and a torrid
little thang with Samy, Jean
meets Laura when she audi-
tions for a film he is working
on. Later when they talk and
she admits that she lied about
her age at the audition, Jean
asks, “Do you often lie?”

“It makes the world more
bearable,” she replies, and so it
is for Jean after this moment.

Whether to tell Laura that he
is infected or not becomes the
dilemma. Choosing to lie, to
say nothing, makes things
more bearable for Jean until
his conscience and love for the
devoted Laura catch up to him.
Most often, Collard’s film
revolves around Jean’s con-
stant little crisis surrounding
his bisexuality, made more
dire by his disease, and
Collard often employs a jar-

Jean (Cyril Collard) and Laura (Romane Bohringer) in Savage Nights.

ring, hand-held camera to
heighten the film’s frenetic
pace.

When finally told Jean has
AIDS, Laura reacts by becom-
ing obsessed with their love,
suffocating him and causing a
scene each time she is con-
fronted with her lover’s dual
sexuality. After one violent
outburst that spills out onto the
street, Laura screams at Jean,
“You suck everyone dry, but

what do you give?” and once
again she elicits a kind of
unknowing truth.

Even Jean’s distant mother
offers the suggestion that the
disease might allow him to
love, to move past his desire
for cheap thrills and into the
“pure” kind of love he says he
feels with Laura. But such
purity is a myth.

Thankfully, Collard does not
move to tie things in a neat

hetero-Hollywood package.
Jean’s bisexuality is never
quite resolved, his struggle is
never over and his story
becomes as real and com-
pelling as a film can be. The
duality of Jean’s sexuality and
the nature of his disease do not
become overblown cinematic
metaphors but rather exist in a
state of film realism seldom
seen on the big screen.

Measure For Measure

Directed by Laura Ann Worthen and
David L. White

Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival
The Pit Theater, June 23-25

Tickets: 624-PLAY

The Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival’s produc-
tion of the classic Measure for Measure is poetic,
insightful and audience—friendly. Scene for scene,
Measure for Measure is Shakespeare done the way
it was intended.

The “Vienna” of the original is set in a Vienna
strongly resembling present day Bosnia/Croatia,
which adds to the play’s questions of moral order
and ethical decisions of any time period.

Stressed out, Duke Vincentio (David Hadinger)
leaves his post to the seemingly reputable Angelo
(John Littlefield) during a hasty leave of his trou-
bled city. At first, Angelo rules to the very letter of
the law, overlooking the inclinations of human
nature. One youth, Claudio (Scott Ferrara), gets his
girlfriend Juliet (Ilona Haris) pregnant, and he is
harshly sentenced to death. His sister Isabella
(Barbara Jo Williams), on the verge of entering a
convent, comes to plead his case to Angelo, who
turns out to be —— guess what — as weak as the
next guy. Angelo says he’ll pardon Claudio if
Isabella will go to bed with him. She resists.

 

Claudio begs her to “just do it,” but luckily, the
Duke has been watching the whole situation devel-
op under the guise of a friar and he has a solution
— unfathomable as it is —— to satisfy all concerned.
Maybe.

Williams is convincingly innocent and tormented
as Isabella. Considering the amount of times she is
literally thrown around the stage, she deserves
accolades for her composure. Hadinger showcases
the Duke’s insecurities, calculating nature, and
most especially, his sense of humor. If you read the
play, this is a welcome interpretation. The arresting
Littlefield provides the audience with an ice-cold
Angelo, surprised by his own desire. His comfort
with the verse and Command of the stage moved
the play along.

Many familiar faces at Pitt stacked the supporting
cast: Michael Hartnett, as the upright Escalus;
Chris Potocki, as funny-yet—slimy Pompey; and
llona Haris, as pitiable Juliet. Glen Alan Gardner
plays the two—faced Lucio with a laugh the audi-

ence will love to hate. Brad Moniz (out of the
Temple arena) performed the terrorizing enforcer,
Elbow, to a degree that was downright haunting.
His creepy voice and eerie physique made the air-
conditioned Pit just a little colder.

This play was not for the weak. The violent set,
full of beat—up putti, leaning crucifixes and barbed
wire expressed this clearly. The lighting was
sparse, and many important dialogues took place in
shadows, but it only made the audience strain to see
more. The dangling bulbs added to the tension in
several pressure situations. There is even a scene
when ﬂashlights are shined on the audience, giving
one the feeling of exposure felt by several of the
characters.

Measure for Measure is a play not of answers,
but of questions. What is morality? Is sex a justi-
fied exchange for a man’s life? What if it was your
brother? Surpassing the very talented acting of
Merchant of Venice , this play also showed the
direction Shakespeare productions are taking to
involve the ‘90s audience. Energetic actors telling a
story that is very easy to relate to, and it’s working,
bringing out the crowds. That’s all that the Bard
ever asked for.

Besides, when was the last time you heard The
Smiths and followed an actor in black leather chaps
at a Shakespeare production?

Ill Communication
Beastie Boys
Capitol/Grand Royal

From hardcore punk to
dopey funk, the Beasties are
still styling as the most illenest
people. 111 Communication, the
B—Boys fourth full-length
release, is an eclectic mix of
jazzy instrumentals, New York
thrash, and freestyle hip hop
— the kickin’ formula that
worked with the somewhat
experimental Check Your
Head. The Beasties continue
spinning seemingly disharmo-
nious beats with even greater
complexity on Ill
Communication, incorporating
hypnotic flute loops, samples
from all over the music world,
a violin and a mantra—like
awakening of baritone voices
chanting in unison. All of these
could fail as gimmicky ﬂops.
but with the Beasties the incan-
tations are delivered with such

sincerity that they represent
nothing but the band’s ability
to be the most consistent inno-
vators of rhyme.

Following the lead of the
meditating Adam Yauch.
MCA, the New York—turned-
LA trio offers hip—hop a social
consciousness desperately
lacking in the Dr. Dre, tough
guy, “l’ll bust a cap in your
ass” era of meathead rhymes.
On “Bodhisattva Vow,” a
Beastie warbles under heavy
distortion, “lf others disrespect
me or give me flak/I’ll stop
and think before I react.” Ill’s
lyrics exude commendable,
positive messages by denounc-
ing rap’s disrespect of women
and praising Dr. King “and his
nonviolent ways,” Mother
Earth, and the power of a
strong mind. With “The
Update,” the Beasties angle
their wit against racism,
putting it bluntly, “Race
against race, such a foolish
wastel lt’s like cutting off your
nose to spite your face.”

But, with all the hype pro-
claiming this record as the Brat
Boys mature, enlightened
piece — which it is ——-( A
Beastie White Album),
wouldn’t it have been easy for
these cheeba—blazing, smart-
alec fools to lose their Paulis

“Sure Shot” refrains “Cause

or the

past

eight
summers for-
mer Pitt bas-
ketball coach
Paul Evans
ran a series
of camps
here for eight
to 18-year-
olds. It was a tremendous
opportunity for kids to learn
basketball skills from big-time
coaches, play ball on the
courts at Fitzgerald Field
House and listen to speeches
from prominent local stars in
the sport.

The featured speakers at
Evans’ camp in years gone by
are notable but few could be
found in the Pitt record books.

Among those who spoke
last summer were Joe
I\,.C.x.«+£n_ Dunno’ (\\x7r\ qqq{q_
tant; Dante Calabria, a high
school All-American that Pitt
could not land; and Norm
Nixon, the greatest player ever
 at Duquesne.

The missing people on that
list are the stars of the Evans
era.

The players in Evans’ pro-
gram were not available to
return in support of their alma
mater.

Now that Ralph Willard has
become the Pitt basketball
coach, the summer camp gig
is his.

Now that Willard is coach,
Evans’ former players are
popping up around campus to
back the new head man.

Willard has coaxed two of
the best basketball players in
Pitt history to lend a helping
hand to his ﬂedgling term as
coach.

Sean Miller, Pitt’s all-time A
assists leader and now an
assistant at Miami, Ohio, is
currently in town to speak to
the youngsters at the camp
running from June 19-23. In
fact Miller spoke yesterday.

Charles Smith, Pitt’s all-
time scoring leader and
(depending on tonight’s out-
come) an NBA champion, will
speak at the camp running
from June 27 through July 1.
Smith, a forward with the
New York Knicks, will be
here only a few days after the
NBA finals conclude.

Neither Miller nor Smith
ever spoke at Evans’ camps.

However, Smith has
returned to Pitt in the past.
Last summer he worked with

By David Saliba

A new attitude and sense of
enthusiasm have found their
way into the track program at
the University of Pittsburgh.
The excitement is a result of
newly appointed head coach
Steve Lewis who will direct
both the men’s and women’s
program under one staff.

For the past 10 years, Lewis
has headed the women’s track
and field team as well as
working with the sprinters and
hurdlers from Pitt’s men’s
team. The hiring of Lewis as
head coach comes only a
month after the retirement of
John Vasvary, coach of the
men’s track and field program
since 1982.

According to Vasvary, Lewis
is the only person for the job.

“He-.’ll do a great job. he
deserves it,” Vasvary said.

Sean Miller, Pitt’s all-time
assist leader trotted into
Fitzgerald Field House yester-
day morning.

No, Miller wasn’t playing
pickup games with Eric
Mobley, Jerry McCullough, or
Darren Morningstar (former
Pitt, Boston Celtics and Dallas
Maverick player).

This time, Miller came as a
coach. Assistant coach Miller,
as he is referred to by the
University of Miami of Ohio
basketball team, lectured at
Pitt’s basketball camp on the
fundamentals of dribbling.

“It was outstanding,” Pitt
assistant Torn Crean said. “He
is an excellent speaker. He
demanded 100 percent from
the beginning and he backed it
up with some outstanding drib-
bling.”

siderable time with our track Coach Lewis has done a won-
program, and in our discus— derful job with the women’s
sions together we felt that program,” Oval Jaynes, athlet-

is now pointing toward the ,   V’   ‘ ' j '
sidelines as he heads into his " “ ’ “
third year as an assistant coach
in Division I basketball.

To say Miller’s dribbling
was outstanding is an under-
statement. He did everything
from shooting foul shots to
dribbling four balls at once.

After watching Miller dis-
play his tools, one thought
back to his illustrious career as
the Panther floor general.
Throughout his years of don-
ning the blue ‘n’ gold, Miller
was simply superb.

As a freshman at Pitt (1987-
88 season), he displayed the
poise and court awareness of a
senior. That year, Miller start-
ed all but four games as he
helped lead Pitt to the Big East
regular season championship.
Pitt defeated Syracuse 85-84 at
the Carrier Dome on the final
game of the year to claim the
title.

“My most memorable
moment at Pitt was when we
won the Big East title,” Miller
recalls. “There were 37,000
people in the stands at the
Carrier Dome and the game
was on CBS.”

That title would not be his
last. At season’s end, the 6-
foot-1-inch guard was selected
by conference coaches as the

ic director at Pitt, said. “We
feel that Steve has earned the
opportunity to be the director
of the track program for both
the men and the women.”

“We believe that it is in the
best interest of our track and
field programs to focus the
efforts of the coaching staff
toward one philosophy,”
Sprague said.

Wes Alexander. a junior hur-
dler on the varsity team,
agrees with this philosophy as
well  with hiring Coach
Lewis.

“I feel he has been running
both teams anyway, so basical-
ly now he’s getting paid for
it,” Alexander said.

Even former athletes who
have run under the guidance of
Lewis are excited to see him

8 get the job.

“I was ecstatic,” Lee
McRae, a sprinter and winner
of four NCAA titles at Pitt
from 1985-1988, said. “I think
for a long time he has had the
program going in the right
direction.”

Lewis sees the new position
as a challenge.

“To have the opportunity,
firsthand, to be a designer, if I
could use that term, to take the
program into a direction so
that it will receive the com-
plete potential that the pro-
gram shows,” Lewis said.

Admission

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

A special NCAA committee
has recommended further
changes to the Proposition 16
initial-eligibility standards
which are set to take effect in
1995 and has also recommend-
ed Prop. l6 be delayed until
August 1996.

The changes, which seem to
give athletes a better chance at
qualifying for college, were
recommended at a meeting of
the NCAA Special Committee
to Review Initial-Eligibility
Standards in early June due to
criticism of Prop. 16.

“There has been much con-
cern raised, especially to the
Academic Requirements
Committee, about the higher
standards [in Prop. 16] for col-
lege entrance,” Pitt'Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes said.
“The standards may deprive a
lot of students and studies
show that minorities are espe-
cially at risk.” 

Currently, an incoming ath-
lete must hav_e at least a score
of 700 on the SAT and a 2.0
GPA to be eligible under
NCAA regulations. Under
Prop. 16, which is currently
scheduled to be implemented
in January 1995, students with
a 700 SAT score will need a
2.5 GPA to be eligible. The
absolute minimum GPA will
still be 2.0, but one must score

a 900 to be eligible with that
particular GPA. However, in
light of the committee’s rec-
ommendation, any action on
requirements will probably be
delayed until August 1996.

“There is no question [Prop.
16] would have an
impact,” Jaynes said. “The
number of students [excluded
by the higher GPA] would be
considerable.”

The committee recommend-
ed a sliding scale, which
would significantly alter the
standards from those originally
dictated by Prop. 16. The slid-
ing scale would allow those

President William Delauder,

who co—chaired the special
committee. “We chose a stan-

The new scale would guide
off a minimum SAT score of
650 and a grade-point average
of 2.4. Students who only
score a 410 on the SAT, where
the l_owest possible score is
400, could still be eligible if
they had a 3.0 GPA. a student
with a GPA of 2.0 would need
an SAT score of 810 for eligi-
bility, 90 points less than need-
ed under Prop. 16.

“The committee was con-
cerned about the graduation
rate of student-athletes but

who do poorly on the SAT to
still be eligible if their GPA
was high enough.

“An academic performance

dard that would maximize
access for student-athletes,
allowing student-athletes who
have a reasonable chance of

.-

ted, continuing academic eligi-
bility rules as well as academic
support services can help that
student succeed academically,”

Richard Peck, president of the
University of New Mexico,
said. Peck also co—chaired the
special committee.

“If the door is closed [to
these students], they never get
a chance. It was the over-
whelming sentiment of the
committee that the standards
should favor opportunity.” 1

According to Jaynes, the rea-
son the committee has recom-
mended delaying all of this
action until August 1996'is due
to the recent announcement
that the Educational Testing
Service will be re-norming
SAT scores.

“It is my understanding that
test scores will increase in this
[re-norming process],“ Jaynes
said. “I’ve heard, for instance,
a verbal score of 424 will be
counted as a 500, and a math
score of 476 will also be 500.”

Jaynes said the recommen-
dation to delay the implemen-
tation of new requirements
will probably be accepted in
order for the NCAA to study
the impact of the altered SAT
scores.

The special committee’s pro-
posal will be forwarded to the
NCAA President’s
Commission, composed of
university presidents from
around the country, for consid-
eration at their meeting June
28. It will also be considered
by the NCAA Council at its
August 8 meeting.

Miller

°Fr0m page 13

Throughout that year Miller
shattered the school record
for assists by a rookie and con-
secutive free throws made
(34).

His sophomore campaign
was highlighted by an arsenal
of three—point bombs.

In games against Villanova
and UConn, the point guard
connected on five of six three-
point attempts.

In the following year, Miller
was supposed to rewrite sever-
al Big East record-books but
instead suffered a season-end-
ing foot injury requiring
surgery. He was forced to red-
shirt the 1989-90 season.

Without Miller’s leadership,
Pitt witnessed its first losing
season (12-17) in seven years.

But the next year, Miller and
the Panthers came back with a
vengeance. During a 22-point
game vs. Seton Hall, he set
a Big East record by sinking
all six of his three—point
attempts.

While leading Pitt in min-
utes, the junior also led the Big
East in free—throw percentage.
Setting a new Big East record
for single-season foul—shooting
percentage with a figure of
.923.

During that year, Pitt won 21
games to go a long with 12
defeats, highlighted with the
Panthers making the NCAA
tournament for the fourth time
in five years. (Pitt lost to
Kansas in the second round.)

As the No. 1 career free-

time assistant coach.

Not coincidentally, that year
Wisconsin junior point guard
Tracey Webster stepped up his
game and turned into an All-
Bi g Ten performer.

“It was great,” Miller said. “I
learned a lot from Stu Jackson
[Badgers head coach] about
the game. I learned more from
him than I did in five years at
Pitt. I learned a lot of the ins
and outs.”

Due to an offer he couldn’t
pass up, Miller left the
Badgers for the Miami, Ohio
Redskins. '

“I left Wisconsin because I
was offered a full—time job.”
Miller said with a smile.

The Blackhawk standout
joined first-year head coach
Herb Sendek, a family friend,
at Miami of Ohio where the
duo turned heads in the Mid-
American conference last year.

“Sean has several attributes,”
Sendek said of his No. 1 assis-
tant.

“He is an outstanding person
 [a] great leader with out-

standing character. He has all
the qualities you would look
for in a coach. He communi-
cates very well as an excellent
teacher. Sean has a strong
work ethic .,. he is a complete
package. He will have a fruit-
ful career.”

Sendek, a Penn Hills native,
also feels Miller’s experience
as a point guard helps.

“Point guards are labeled as
coaches on the floor,” he said.
“Sean played the position, thus
giving him valuable experi-
ence, which is a very perfect
package.”

Sendek also feels that
Miller’s age is an asset to the
team.

“[Miller’s] age allows him to
relate to the players,” Sendek
said.

With the Redskins perfor-
mance of a year ago (19 wins,
second place in the conference
and an NIT bid), who would
differ with Sendek’s decision
to rebuild with one of the ris-
ing young coaches in the
NCAA?

Lewis

0From page 13

With the acquisition of the
head-coaching job, Lewis
takes on the responsibility of
directing both programs, a task
that he feels qualified to do.

“Because I have been coach-
ing both men and women since
I have been here, the differ-
ence will come with responsi-
bility,” Lewis said.

Lewis sees the combination
of both teams’ staff as an
opportunity to succeed as one
team. As for the athletes, they
look forward toa new unity in
the program.

“I believe that the team will
become closer, especially
since the team is now under
one coach, which is something
that we could use,” Alexander
said.

According to McRae, who
set the world indoor 55-meter-

Pitt, the attitude of Lewis will
have a positive impact on the
team as a whole.

“The team will now have his
attitude which is win, win,

win,” McRae said. “When you and ideas with all of his ath-
letes. The coming season will

have one attitude you can go

in the same direc-
tion.”

“Being a unit or
close knit is a result
of  the things that
we do as a team and
as a program. And I
expect that it will
happen,” Lewis said.

McRae stresses
that Lewis’ attitude
is strong not only on
the track but also in
the classroom.

“The athletes that
he has worked with
have high graduation
rates. That is one of
his focuses and any-
thing you do on the
track is extra,”
McRae said. “He
stresses academics
and that is the most
important thing for
an athlete.”

The success of the Pitt
women during the career of
Lewis has produced three Big
East Outdoor Track and Field
Championships —-— 1990, ‘9l
and ‘94 —— along with the con-

The influence of Lewis has
helped shape such illustrious
careers at Pitt as two-time
Olympic gold medalist Roger
Kingdom, All—American Eric
Cannon, and McRae.

Mobley on putting some new
offensive moves in his game.
This helped Mobley’s future
NBA draft status. Besides that
Smith never did much that
directly benefited Evans’ pro-
gram.

Willard. who received a
birthday cake and gifts at his
inauguration as Pitt coach, is
getting more backing in his
first few months from the Pitt
hoops family tree than Evans
did in eight years.

“They couldn’t_have picked
a better guy,” Miller said yes-
terday after finishing his
speech at Willard’s camp.

“Pitt is a perfect match and
some great things will hap-
pen.”

There is no complaint here.
Willard probably deserves this
kind of treatment and at some
schools it might be expected,
but maybe Evans could have
used it too.

This brings up a couple of
points about the coaching
change last spring. a) It is
obvious Evans operated with a

minimum of support from oth-

ers in and around the program
and b) Evans may actually

have contributed to losing his

own job by alienating himself
from valuable resources like
Miller and Smith.

“Coaches are good when
they have good rapport with
their players, you know what I
mean?” Miller said.

Yeah, but apparently Evans
did not.

In any case, actions are said
to be louder than words and all
this says a mouthful about how
Evans’ players thought of their
coach.

it was necessary to inform medical

the discrepancies with the data. He said
the results without the fraudulent data
still remained the same after re-analy-

According to Fisher, there was no
evidence in any way that the outcomes
of the studies were changed.

“These women out there should
know on an American-taxpayer study
that there is some fraudulent informa-

Representative Dan Schaefer (R-

the women to decide for themselves.

of the new committee, a plan for new

posed.

“We are working on revisions of
the NSABP constitution and bylaws
that will shift a good deal of responsi-
bility for management of NSABP from
the group chair to a reconstituted exec-

He said the NSABP has also estab-

The search for the new chair of the

O’Connor. A search committee of five
people has just been established and
O’Connor said the decision should be
made by late summer, early fall.

Members include Herberman; Detre;
Olivera J. Finn, associate professor of
molecular genetics and biochemistry;
Theresa Whiteside-Nimick, professor
of pathology and otolaryngology and
director of the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute’s Immunologic Monitoring
and Diagnostic Laboratory; and Dr.
Richard L. Simmons, assistant vice
president of Clinical Affairs at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical

Two breast cancer survivors who are

Interview-

°Fr0m page 5

On the subject of race,
Harmon said he is encouraged
by the fact he sees all kinds of
students involved in activities
at Pitt. ‘

“And students have estab-
lished a line of communica-
tion,” Harmon said. “Even
though they may not agree,
they still discuss things.”

He said he would like to see
diversity become more of a
university-wide effort.

“Diversity is often placed on
the heads of students, especial-
ly on—campus, when it should
be an institutional concern.”
Harmon said. “It is the stu-
dents who live diversity.
Faculty and staff go home to
their own communities every
night and usually these com-
munities can be described in
ethnic terms.”

When discussing his resig-
nation, Harmon said it is not
because of any problem he had
at Pitt.

“I always said, ifl would
leave Pitt, I would go to one of
four schools,” he said, noting
University of California-
Berkeley, Princeton and Texas

‘A & M as his other three

choices.

Harmon said Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor has known
of his interest in Virginia for a
while and knew Harmon might
have left if an opportunity
existed.

“I’ve discussed this before
[with O’Connor] because I
wouldn’t want him to think it
was out of any disloyalty or
disapproval of his direction for
this university,” Harmon said.
