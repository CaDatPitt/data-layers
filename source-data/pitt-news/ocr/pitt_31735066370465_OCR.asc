UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH FRIDAY, MARCH 28, 1986

Faculty Assembly meets to discuss

Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

Members of Pitt's University Senate
Faculty Assembly have expressed an
interest in developing a long-range plan
for faculty salary increases.

At a meeting yesterday afternoon,
David Platt, chairman of the Senate
Budget Policies Committee, presented
a resolution that would allow faculty
members to have a say in long—range
budget planning for possible salary in-
creases. The resolution also requested

that faculty have input in the prepara-
tion of state appropriation requests.

“What we see every year is a short-
term planning with the work of ap-
propriation requests," said Platt. “In
the long range, there should be con-
sideration of the needs of the entire
university. What we‘re concerned
about is the area in which the needs
have not been fully addressed, and that
area is salary increases."

Platt said that the two major variables
in dealing with salary increases come
from student tuition and state

appropriations.

As it stands  the appropriations
request is done without the input of the
faculty,” said Platt, “and we need
faculty involvement."

The faculty agreed upon the resolu-
tion but sent it back to the committee
with suggested changes. Once the
changes are made, the resolution will
be sent to the senate council.

Plan also dicussed another resolution
calling for a minimum seven percent
salary increase that must be agreed
upon by the faculty. The current

resolution stresses that the average
salary increases of Pitt faculty have
been lower than the average salary in-
creases of faculty in other institutions
in the Association of American Univer-
sities.

The majority of the faculty present
at the meeting agreed to pass the
resolution, and one member abstained.

One of the faculty members dis-
agreeing with the resolution was Pro-
fessor Hershey. “I do not think we
should have to come down to seven
percent,“ said Hershey. “Why not ask

salary hikes

for eight percent?“

The Senate Faculty Assembly also
reviewed other proposed resolutions
and reports. Allen Janis, chairman of
the Senate Library Committee,
presented a status report on the 1981
recommendations of the Provost’s Task
Force on University Libraries.

He then presented a resolution that
called for the University Library Ser-
vices acquisitions budget for ﬁscal year
1987 to be a minimum of 2.1 million.

The resolution was approved by the
Senate Budget Policies Committee.

Japanese and Syrian student organiza-
tions would also present some type of
musical entertainment.

the Ukranian, Indian and Malasian stu-
dent organizations, along with the

American Youth Hostels organization.

PISO is affiliated with the Office of
International Services. The organiza-
tions purpose. according to Courey.
is “to provide a forum for intcmational
and American students to exchange
ideas and to provide a common ground
for international understanding."

ODN is an organization of the
Graduate School of Public and lnter~
national Affairs. “ODN works in the
third world with social and economic
development,” Courey said.

tegral part of the university communi-
ty at Pitt."

l.aRouche followers are running on bal—

UPI found that LaRouche‘s National

A Wind of War

This week’s clash between U.S. and Libyan
military in the Gulf of Sidra has met with a danger-
ously short-sighted response by Congress, the media
and the general population.

The often cited arguments in support of U.S. policy
— unsubstantiated claims of Libyan—sponsored inter-
national terrorism and the laws and rights governing
conduct in international waters — provide little more
than a neat rationalization for U.S. belligerency.

At the same time, these arguments reveal a naivete
of portentous trends in U.S. foreign policy under the
Reagan administration. For example, although it has
been made public that Reagan approved the Navy
maneuvers with explicit intent. to engage Libyan
forces in combat, few have questioned the respon-
sibility of such an action. Republican Senator Mark
Hatf1eld’s statement that “we are engaging in
childlike games of ‘dare and double-dare’ with a sick
and dangerous clown’ ’ is a rare exception to the rule.

We of the university community must look through
the technocratic rhetoric of the Reagan administra-
tion to which the mass media and society at large have
proved so gullible. The militaristic essence of U.S.
policy toward Libya and Nicaragua and the paranoia
characterizing U.S.-Soviet relations belie a fundamen-
tal insecurity of the United States in global affairs.

We as a nation have been consistently incapable of
producing any coherent and intelligent response to ob-
vious changes in global relations. These changes in-
clude the increasing assertion by small states of their
sovereignty, albeit at times in the ludicrous form of
Moammar Khadafy. In the absence of intelligence,
we ‘ﬂex our muscles’; the word ‘diplomacy’ has
become an anachronism in this decade.

The United States appears possessed by Reagan’s
frightening leadership in our great showdown with
the world. The above analysis combined with the
Reagan administration’s military buildup, the most
intense in the history of nations, demonstrates the
danger of this kind of posturing. History has shown
us that in the real world such blind allegiance will
not end as it does on the movie screen.

Blacks
Cheated

I am writing this letter in response
to two articles that appeared in the
editorial section of The Pitt News that
dealt with the subject of racism and the
campus police at Pitt. As a junior here
at Pitt, I have had time to observe Pitt's
advantages socially and academically
as well as the injustices. especially
regarding the campus police.

In a recent letter to The Pitt News.
a white female wrote how uncomfor-
table she felt walking through the main
Towers Lobby on a Friday night. She
felt as though she was “invading black
territory." A few things need to be said
about that. Many times after parties
held by black Greek organizations,
black students gather in the lobby. See-
ing that black parties held at the Stu-
dent Union must end at l a.m. with no
alcohol allowed to be served. black
students have nowhere else to go to
socialize, unlike the white frat parties
held at university-owned frat houses
which serve alcohol and allow students
of other schools to attend — I'm sure
these parties last past I a.m. Where are
the black frat houses? Do the police
stand at the door and check for Pitt ID
at white frat parties? You can’t hold
them at homes without police coming
with complaints of noise and too many
people in one house.

The Towers Lobby is another issue.
Maybe someone can answer this: Why
is it that when there are more than 15
black people in the lobby, someone
(presumably the Towers desk) calls the
campus police? I don’t see the police
there during the day or when there is
a gathering of white people at any time
of the day. Is there a time limit or
number limit when black students are
allowed to talk in the lobby? It has got-
ten to the point that if 15 black people
are there brieﬂy then three or more
police are called. Believe me, it hap-
pened a few weeks ago. Regardless, all
the Towers desk needs to do is come
over the microphone and say, “Clear
the lobby.“ as I'm sure they have with
white students, right?

One last situation I would like to
bring to attention. One weeknight, I
and a few other people were in the lob-
by. Behind us. sitting alongside the
wall, was a black male student and
female. A campus policeman ap-
proached him and asked to see some
form of ID. He showed the policeman
and the policeman left, but not before
hearing racist comments cast in his
direction from the people who observed

this. If this doesn't indicate some form
of racism that exists at Pitt, and I'm
sure there are more, then I don’t know
what does.

“We Don’t Bite’ ’

I was not surprised to read the irra-
tional remarks pertaining to some of the
actions of blacks at the University of
Pittsburgh (“Human Action Society."
The Pitt News, March I4). What I was
surprised at is that it took so long for
some obviously confused person to
write it!

First of all, I would like to know ex-
actly what is wrong with my loving
my God-given color and wearing a but-
ton stating so‘? If the Irish can wear
buttons saying “Kiss Me I'm Irish"
and the Italians can wear buttons say-
ing “God Made The Italians No.l."
then who are you to determine that I‘m
a racist simply because I choose to
wear an “I Love Being Black" button
(of which I happen to be the creator).
Just because I love myself for who I
am and what I am, and I choose to
show it doesn‘t mean I hate or think I'm
better than any other person or group
of people. I treat each individual as an
individual no matter what color he or
she may be!

Second of all, I would like to address
your phobia of not possessing the abili-
ty to walk through the Towers Lobby
at night (with a feeling of security)
simply because you're white. I believe
this stems from some predetermined
negative stereotypical concepts you
have developed about black people or
you may have obtained the fear that
black people want to repay white peo-
ple back for the evil and inhumane suf-
fering they have inﬂicted upon us.
Nevertheless, fear not. For no matter
what you may have heard, we don't
bite!

Let it also be known to everyone
reading this letter that blacks, just like
any other race, havebertain needs. We
don't have (what I consider a necessi-
ty) places to go to socialize. The “black
Greeks” at Pitt don’t have luxury
dorms to have a party or other event
at, like the “white Greeks" on the
hill. We don’t have clubs in Oakland
that cater to our needs. Thus the only
facility we can utilize for a party or
other social function is the Student
Union, which instantly tells us that:
l) We’ll be under the careful eye of two
University of Pittsburgh police ofﬁcers
at all times; 2) We'll have to end the
event at I a.m.; and of course 3) Ab-

solutely, positively, no alcohol of any
nature.

So the sad, realistic truth about it is
we don’t have the freedom of choice
like you do. and the Towers Lobby is
basically the only place that black peo-
ple can congregate and at least talk to
each other. But there you have it again;
the Pitt police don’t like to see so many
of us congregating. so they eventually
try to move us along.

So, in concluding. I say to whomever
you are who wrote that letter. don't
waste your time writing nonsense. If
you really want to help, then criticize
the administrators at Pitt who feel that
blacks don’t need a social life, just
education.

Sales of the I986 Panther Prints
Yearbook are well under way. Al-
though some seniors have had their pic-
tures taken. many have not.

How come?

The editor and staff of the yearbook
would like to inform the students at the
University of Pittsburgh that we real-
ly do have a yearbook. It's funny how
a small group of people work hard to
put out an award-winning yearbook.
and after all their efforts, support at Pitt
is lacking. If this lack of support con-
tinues, the future of the yearbook is in
jeopardy, and subsequent graduating
classes will lose their memories at Pitt.

The yearbook does serve a purpose.
Senior pictures are taken, group and
club pictures are taken. Greeks have
their own section, and university events
are all represented. Every student’s op-
portunities at Pitt are kept alive in the
yearbook, yet students are reluctant to
buy the book. Why? We constantly ask
ourselves that question. This book will
be a remembrance of your college days
at Pitt. In 30 years, you will still have
the book, with your name on the cover,
as it looks as you receive it.

Please consider my message to you.
Remember, a yearbook is the only
bound history book of a university.

If student support is not shown, we I

may not have a book to sell in five
years.

Why I Don’t Support Disinvestment

Like flies on a rotting carcass,
American university students have been
swarming over the issue of disinvest-
rnent for many months now, convinc-
ed of the righteousness of their cause.
They have been picketing gold ex-
changes; they have been staging sit ins;
at Pitt, Students For A Free South
Africa have been pressuring the ad-
ministration to disinvest all university
funds tied up in trade with South
Africa. For what reason? Why, to top-
ple the specter of apartheid and end
racism once and for all. A cause! A
cause! At last we have a cause! Isn’t
it wonderful to gang together and all
be right about something?

Unfortunately, the situation in South
Africa is inﬁnitely more complicated
than it seems. and the hysterical band-
wagon radicalism that has captivated
collegiate America is naive, misguid-
ed. dangerous and, at times, incredibly
stupid. This past week, a perfectly
respectable Oakland business was
picketed because of an allegation that
t ; establishment sold some sort of fruit
tandy that comes from South Africa.

The Pitt News, sadly. added fuel to the

fire by accidentally publishing a
libelous letter that amounted to a call
to arms to all conscientious disinvest-
ment groupies to help crush the
“racist" store. This incident reads like
a brilliant passage from some satire of
the depths to which idealistic young
people will sink; tragically, it actually
happened.

That is an extreme example, but it
points out the difference between the
respective climates of intellectual life
in the '60s and the ’80s, civil rights was
a live, immediate, real issue, and
because the problem was rooted here
at home, the discourse was intelligent,
rational and, ultimately, productive.
There was a definite problem, and a
population of educated people worked
to solve it. Civil rights have still not
been completely realized, but the pro-
per steps were set in motion in those
days, and in a generation or two,
America could well be the world’s first
racially integrated society.

In the ‘80s, college students have
been causeless, happy to sit back and
have things done for them. The world
grows darker, and people grow more

orn Again!

Behold the most recent issue of Pent-
house Magazine, and a gamy one it is.
There is a partially clad wench on the
cover, a story about “North Carolina‘s
Holy War on Sex,” something about
Sikh terrorists being trained in the
United States and, in this magazine so
dirth that it has been condemned by the
government's commission on por-
nography, a book excerpt written by.

apathetic. About now, our consciences
begin to bother us, and we think,
“Well, maybe we should do something
 but where do we begin?” Sudden-
ly — bingo! We have the answer hand-
ed to us in a nice, neat, black—and—white
package: apartheid.

Yes, apartheid is wrong. No one is
disputing that. But we must ask
ourselves: What is disinvestment? Is it
ultimately meaningful? Is it the most
responsible way to deal with the
problem?

The first thing that we must realize
is that South Africa. in almost every
respect, is a typical African nation.
Apartheid is merely South Africa’s ver-
sion of what nearly all African coun-
tries have developed: a state-
sanctioned, university—conceived
political theory that defines racial dif—’
ferences as integral to the distribution
of benefits and priveleges, as well as
fundamental services and rights. That
does not make apartheid less insidious.
butit is fairly hypocritical to single out
one nation among many for economic
sabotage. And sabotage it is. One way
in which South Africa is different from

nother Cl0isielShave In BLirma/ Ste hen Morrison

————————_________________I?.____

other African nations is that it has a
strong, modern economy, one that will
not be‘adversely affected, in the long
run, by even a full-blown economic
boycott by all Western nations. Indeed,
the current govemment of South Africa
shows every sign of moving away from
apartheid on its own. Botha’s
“regime," contrary to their media im-
age, is a fairly progressive one, one
that realizes that it is in the best interest
of not only blacks but business to phase
apartheid out, and until the American
press adopted the situation as its pet
overseas atrocity, slow reform seem-
ed to be solving the problem.

We must not forget, too. that apart-
heid is only the most obvious problem
of that beleaguered nation. Like other
African countries, South Africa is suf-
fering a rapid population increase, an
epidemic that aggravates racial disputes
(not merely white vs. black) and has
led to civil wars in Nigeria, the Sudan,
Chad, Zaire and Uganda. This popula-
tion explosion has driven alarming
numbers into the cities. where rigid
police action is the only way to keep
the towns and villages from falling into

utter chaos. The “ruthless police” are
simply trying to ensure the survivial of
the state itself, and please don’t try to
convince me that anarchy is a more
desirable scenario than a repressive,
police—maintained, but far from
totalitarian, government.

South Africa's problems are so over-
whelming that a destructive civil

war/revolution seems inevitable, but it ,

is not likely that racially balanced
society will emerge. It may be too late
for any African nation to achieve that. .
By calling for disinvestment, we are
merely banging our heads against the
proverbial wall.

In the September 1985 issue of Com-
mentary. Paul Johnson summed it up: .
“All African states are racist. There is
no such thing as genuinely multiracial
society in the whole of Africa. There
is no African country where tribal or
racial origins, skin color or religious
affiliation are not of prime importance
in securing elementary rights.” And in
the battle to rid one African nation of
its immoral doctrine. as Johnson noted,
“the loser will be the U.S. economy."

Post Writers Gr0up/ Richard Cohen
William F. Buckley In Penthouse

and Ronald Reagan and a frequent
visitor to the White House. That
William F. Buckley.

And, yes, that Penthouse. The very
same magazine cited on page 9 of the
draft report prepared by the Attorney
General‘s Commission on Pomography
—— the part dealing with soft-core porn-
ography. In the draft. the commission
states that 7-Eleven stores “are the
leading retailers of soft—core porn
magazines in America" and "the
single most important outlet" for Pent-
house. “Profits made by 7-Eleven on
porn run into the millions." In case you
don’t get the commission‘s drift, Pent-

house is porn.

Censors, though, are totally without
subtlety. They don’t realize that the
president is not serious about por-
nography, otherwise, as day follows
night. he would banish Buckley and his
son from the White House - or make
them both wear bags over their heads.
Instead, the censors take both the presi-
dent and Ed Meese at their word. They
have made up their minds about Pent-
house. Playboy and similar magazines.
They have‘ already defined pornog-
raphy as “a serious national problem"
and have been up to their ears in smut

trying to do something about it. They
would dearly love to censor. Only the
Constitution stands in their way. Darn!

But others have already been moved
to action. In Washington, for instance.
the two largest drugstore chains have
stopped selling Playboy. Penthouse and
similar magazines. The result of all this
misplaced moral piety is that you now
can not buy either Bill Buckley or Ron
Reagan in many a Washington drug-
store. That might not seem too serious
a blow. But if the present rules were
in effect in September 1983. you would
have had a difficult time finding the

The Nominating Committee

Playboy interview with members of the

terview the president cited in his recent

same holds for Jimmy Carter's famous
lust—in-my—heart interview.

Trimming the airwaves of synthetic
rhythms is leaning the balance of new
music toward the past. Fewer bands
are relying on computer-generated
sound and are confidently fashioning
music based on their sensibility to per-
form artistically and naturally. Speak-
ing with lan Astbury, lead vocalist for
The Cult, it became increasingly ap-
parent that The Cult’s approach to
composing was to address the many
politics of Love (the title of their
American debut album) through an in-
terest to develop harmony and
“respect between man and his en-
vironment.”

Influenced by Alice Cooper, The
Doors and Jimi Hendrix, The Cult

 

utilizes a layered guitar cadence

representative of the late 1960s but not
in the sense of psychedelia and its
cultural extremes. its approach is
rooted within a London scene from
around 1981, over which the specter
of Jim Morrison loomed: People were
tired of pop and disco and turned to
rock.

Astbury’s first band, Theater of
Hate, came out of the post-punk
period, an era when English youth was
searching for alternatives to the ag-
gression and antagonism of punk. in
his founding years, he knew that he
wanted to create a multi-cultural con-
text, which led to the forming of
Southern Death Cult. Then, upon
meeting guitarist Billy Dully, their
sound began to form and to become
concrete, as did their name —- from
Death Cult to The Cult. The name took

 

on the connotation of a group which
had found the boundaries of love
unlimited, a group which had a venera-
tion for the same — thus their final title.

Their affinity for rock and its need to
be reconstructed on the roots of elec-
tric, not computerized, instrumentation
and multi-cultural interpretations of
love, forged The Cult’s revival of the
rawness and richness of early ex-
perimental rock. Their “old school”
orientation, Astbury said, is a means
“to avoid pigeonholing and retain an
individuality” which can be read as
fresh, due to their non-classical train-
ing. Ostensibly, they are self-taught,
(“Never took a lesson in my life.”) they
avoid labeling (An English critic called
Southern Death Cult “positive punk.")
and base their music in romantic rock
“for people who want to remember in

the bedroom.”

Lyrically, Astbury and Dully research
the symbols of “non-European cul-
tures throughout history” and then
build upon their various mythologies.
Buddhist, Egyptian and North
American lndian cultures are favored
for the complexity of their myths: “Nir-
vana,” “Phoenix” and “Brother Wolf,
Sister Moon.” So while their topics
tend toward the religious, they
transpose the content within the im-
mediate culture and work with a tenaci-
ty for “addressing a broader range.”
Astbury plainly points out that “we
don’t use irony, we’re not mystic, we
don’t say we were born in Tibet,” as
if to clarify any scrutiny and miscon-
ception which may be conjured up
from the word “cult.” Thus they seem

THE OFFICIAL BUPPIE HANDBOOK
By Thayer William Staples IV
and Katherine McMillan Staples

Pyramid Designs Press

   

By Michael Fay

By now I'm sure we’ve all run into
a yuppie or two. Even for those of us
who heard all the hoopla and tried our
best to steer clear, it all happened too
fast. They're young. They’re urban.
They’re professional. And they’re go-
ing to live the “good |ife” if it kills them.
it’s a jungle out there, and they see no
reason why one shouldn't just slash
through it with a wine cooler in one
hand and the wheel of a BMW in the
other. This is the dream. This is the
’80s, and they’ve got both down to a
science. But wait a minute, is this new,
fast-paced, pseudo-prosperity solely a
phenomenon among white Ameri-
cans?

According to Thayer and Katherine
Staples, it’s not. But this is not to say,
according to the Staples, that buppies
or black urban profesionals are simp-
ly yuppies in blackface. To clarify this
point, they penned The Official Buppie
Handbook.

The Buppie Handbook, much like its
yuppie predecessor, is a collection of
lists which are meant to sum up the

buppie attitude and lifestyle in such a _

way that they are able to look at
themselves in an ironic, humorous
manner. But to say it’s tongue-in-
cheek is not to say that any of it is fic-
titious or even exaggerated. No, in
fact, reader identification is the key.
Someone reads it and says, “That’s
funny. That’s ridiculous. That’s absurd
[pause] hey  whoa  that's me! [His
face turns red. He looks both ways.
Gainshis composure. And says to
himself  ] Well, at least I'm making
60 grand this year. Hee, hee, hee  ”
And then he feels better, laughs some
more and buys copies for all his
friends.

The Buppie Handbook is 88 pages
of the black urban professional “look,”
“ride,” education, entertainment, etc.
The pinnacle of this existence is the
“Baaad Buppie.” The “Baaad Bup-
pie” is not only a successful buppie
but a world traveler and a man or

 

woman of impeccable taste and style.

Your average buppie, however, is
not a species unknown to Shadyside
or Station Square. He or she goes out
to eat a lot, enjoys jazz fusion, is at
least mildly obsessed with money and ‘
things and likes to consider himself a
health-conscious person. After all,
what good is conspicuous consump-
tion if one is not around to stand next
to it.

If you are a buppie, if you wish you
were or if you just know one (and we
know you do), then this revealing,
humorous look at their lives and their
aspirations might just compel your
curiosity and a few of your entertain-
ment dollars. However, without a direct
or indirect sense of identification with
this lifestyle, a reader might well not
get the joke. The tone of the book is
not that of an outrageous lampoon; in-
stead, it is instilled with steady,
underlying irony and sarcasm which
would probably go unnoticed by those
outside the phenom.

Whatever happened to Ellen Broadhurst?

By Carrie Stetler

After winning two free tickets to the

. Led Zeppelin Iaserium show at the

Buhl Planetarium, I asked myself two
questions: What is a Iaserium? And,
aren’t I too old to be sitting in one
listening to Led Zeppelin with a bunch
of raucous, drugged-up teen-agers?

Laser technician/choreographer
John Hanson helped answer my first
question. “Laserium” is like another
word for auditorium, he told me —— an
auditorium with a 200-foot-high ceiling
on which laser light is projected in syn-
chronization with music. Depending on
your aesthetic sensibilities (or your
state of mind), the result of this
dazzling display will look like either a
ballet in neon or a series of giant glow-
in-the-dark Spiro Graphs.

“These shows are an art form as
much as they are technical,” Hanson
said. “lt’s all live, too. People think it's
canned, but it's not. There’s a series
of basic shapes and designs that come
from the main lab, but l put ‘them
together and choreograph them so that
every show is different. You can't
substitute human care with a machine.
We are holistic, gestalt beings.”

Hanson, who does about 200
Iaserium shows a year (Pink Floyd be-
ing one of his favorites) has been in-
volved with laser art since its inception.
This happened in 1973 when inde-
pendent filmmaker Ivan Dryer started
experimenting with laser light and
discovered that he could produce
designs which ‘‘looked like they were
from another planet,” according to
Hanson. “He was blown away by the
purity and brilliance of the colors.”

With this in mind, my friend and I
enter the Iaserium with a handful of
teen-agers who are neither very

» raucous or noticably drugged-up. Most

of them look like they come here pret-
ty often for the lack of anything better
to do on a weekni ht. it's too cold for

ittsburgh

The Pittsburgh Opera will stage Ver-
di’s La Forza del Destino for the first
time in 20 years here in Pittsburgh on
April 3, 5 and 8 at Heinz Hall.
Showcase interviewed Tim Shaidlin,
music administrator and chorus
master for the Pittsburgh Opera to
discuss the opera, Verdi and ways a
novice operagoer might better enjoy
the performance.

Showcase: In two of the commen-
taries I read on the opera, the writers
both stated that the title La Forza del

- Déstino (The Force of Destiny) was

somewhat of a misnomer as the opera
wasn’t concerned so much with fate as
it was with a series of coincidences
running throughout the work. Would
you agree?

Shaidlin: Well, ‘fate is a vague word.
How different is it from coincidence?
The Italians have a lot of words for fate
or destiny, and destino — a very
melodramatic word in Italian — is on-
ly one of them. I think the librettist used
the word because the main characters
had a lot of bad luck, whether they
deserved it or not.

Showcase: But if you think about

  

them to hang around outside, and they
are probably tired of listening to Led
Zeppelin in their bedrooms and cars.
As the lights dim, a few of the more
uninhibited teens gather on a low,
carpeted platform so that they can
watch the show lying down.

When the Iaserium is dark, the bland
jazz fusion that had been playing is

turned off, and John Hanson's disem-
bodied voice greets his audience with
avuncular familiarity. “Remember,
there are actually people back here,
and we can see what's going on out
there, so please refrain from lighting
any uh  substances.” When a few
people groan, he adds cheerfully: “But
hey, there are some things you can do
in the dark.” Ever the polite sky-pilot,
he signs off with: “Sit back and relax
and we'll see you in about an hour."

Having been launched for the way-
out world of laser light, everyone
cranes their necks as if awaiting indoor
fireworks. Squiggly lines and bright,
star-like dots appear way above our
heads. When the music begins, Robert
Plant is singing about something
called the “de ths of mordor” or “the

pera and

the work, the death of the marquis, by
accidental gunshot, was not really
willed by anyone or premeditated in
any way, yet it set offa chain of events
that gravely affected three of the
characters’ lives.

depths of mortar.” I remember this
song, it’s — “Ramble On." Suddenly
I am vividly reminded of my adolescent
passion for Led Zeppelin. Why did I
like them so much once? Peer
pressure? Repressed sexuality? Pot?
Whatever the reason, I like them all
over again. Those whomping yet shrill
guitars; the orgiastic squeals of Robert

Plant; the senseless yet somehow
touching ballads like “Goin’ to Califor-
nia” with its lute or mandolin or
whatever accompaniment.

Some of the lasers look like big
Slinkies or enormous, billowy hairnets.
l have a memory of sitting in the living
room of my girlhood friend, Ellen
Broadhurst, eating chocolate cup-
cakes and admiring Robert Plant's
hair. When the Led Zeppelin emblem
appears above my head, I remember
how I used to draw it on junior high
school desk tops, even though I didn’t
know what it was. Ellen had to explain
it to me. “When they made their first
song, they didn’t think it would be a hit,
so Jimmy Page said, ‘Oh, this will go
up the charts like a Led Zeppelin.’ l



The Force

opera for a novice to see?

Shaidlin: Yes, the work has a lot of
dramatic moments — of tension,
realism and passion. It's exciting, and
the locale, Spain and Italy, is so color-

 

O. .-

Verdi in St. Petersburg for the prem

    

iere of La Forza

Shaidlin: Yes, that’s the element of
fate right there, an original dramatic
touch and a shocker for someone see-
ing the opera for the first time. In view
of the safety devices on guns today,
the audience is surprised to see a gun
go off simply by throwing it on the floor.

Showcase: l’ve never seen Forza

j and I wonder if it has a lot of the Ver- _

dian drama that you get in, say, Aida
or Rigo/etto? Wouldn't it be a good

' ful. l think it’s an excellent introduction
for the opera beginner or novice.

Showcase: Verdi was a masterful
musical craftsman in representing
mood, emotion and character in his
operas. But did he do much in the way

of thematic phrasing or leitmotif?

Shaidlin: He was more reserved in
the use of leitmotif than most com-
posers. Many people attribute this to

Now it looks like there's a giant elec-
tric tie-dyed T-shirt on the ceiling. My
friend falls asleep. Listening to the sex-
ist, incoherent “Livin’, Lovin’ She’s
Just a Woman” I recall a certain poster
that Ellen used to have above her bed.
It was a huge picture of Robert Plant
wearing purple, bell-bottom hip-
huggers and rubbing his crotch. ‘‘I’d
like to party with him,” Ellen would say
as we stared at it wistfully. A few
months later and Ellen was to begin
wearing Moccasin boots and looking
through her grandmother's medicine
cabinet in hopes of finding prescription
drugs to experiment with.

The Iaserium ceiling is now alive
with actual forms rather than mere
spots and squiggly shapes. A horse
gallops by. It gallops by upside down.
Big, green lips open and close in
time with ‘‘whole Lotta Love.” A
hangman’s noose forms, looking as if
it’s about to strangle the entire au-
dience. The climax of the laser light
show is reached when a stairway
forms during “Stairway to Heaven."
The teens gaze at it reverently, prob-
ably wishing that they could climb it
and escape their confining Pittsburgh
existences to smoke a few celestial
doobies with John Bonham.

When the lights come up again, l’m
still nostalgic. Whatever happened to
Ellen Broadhurst? I moved from New
Jersey when l was 16 and never saw
her again, but I'll always remember her
album collection and the sound of her
voice irritably reporting: “l found some
Darvocets in there, and I took two, but
nothing happened. What about these
blue things? Do they look like anything
to you? Can you get high off of these?"

As I leave the Iaserium l’m glad to
be 22 again. Memories of my formative
years were beginning to depress me.
it'll be awhile before l come back to the

the competitive relationship he had
with Richard Wagner, the preeminent
leitmotif composer of all time. Verdi
and Wagner were contemporaries
and, being the two most famous com-
posers of their time, were rivals for the
attention they got from the media and
the public. But beginning with his mid-
dle operas, Verdi uses it to some
degree in such works as Rigoletto with
the curse theme. And, of course, by
the time he got to his later works he
used it a lot more.

Showcase: I've heard that in La For-
za Verdi includes a “fate theme,” but
that occurs only in the overture. Is this
true?

Shaidlin: I read that, too. But in
chorus rehearsal for La Forza I found
its recurrence in the choral invocation
with the monks and Father Guardiano
in Act I, Scene II. There’s a tremen-
dous suspended climax, where it
recurs, with a diminished chord, fol-
lowed by a dead silence and a
dramatic pause. Then, very quietly, the
orchestra plays three E Naturals just
prior to the chorus’ vocal entry. l had
never heard or read that this was the
recapitulation of the fate theme

SONGS FROM LIQUID DAYS
Philip Glass
CBS Records

Philip Glass isn’t a name we hear
often, but maybe we should. His album
Glassworks has sold 175,000 copies
worldwide and he does about 50 sold-
out performances per year. He has
also written the soundtrack for Paul
Schrader’s film, Mishima, and recent-
ly has given us a new album, Songs
from Liquid Days. While Glass is expe-
rienced in both opera and musical
theater, this is his first endeavor with
the song form.

This album is a collaboration of

3 many songwriters, vocalists and musi-
cians, but for the most part is Glass’
conception. David Byrne of the Talk-
ing Heads, Paul Simon, Suzanne Vega
and Laurie Anderson provide the lyrics
and help out with the music. Once the
words were set to music, Glass then
“casted” singers to convey their
messages. Among the -chosen
vocalists are Linda Ronstadt, Bernard
Fowler and the Roches. According to
Glass, proper casting is essential to
the character of the song.

The music is beautiful, peaceful and

A 7 undisturbing. Glass chooses acoustic

instrumentation which helps to create
this mood. Violins, French horns and
flutes are blended in exquisite or-
chestration to give the listener a
refreshing breakfrom today’s sterile
and impersonal high—tech recordings.
This is not music to get up and
dance to, nor is it to provide a
background for your dinner. This
music requires your full attention to
, receive its full benefit. We can easily
get lost in the beautiful harmonies and
gently flowing rhythms of each of the
six pieces.Sit back, relax, and listen

to the lyrics. That’s what this album

 

was created for.

The words, as one might expect
from Byrne or Anderson, are quite
abstract and, therefore, open to inter-
pretation by the listener. This is one of
the beauties of the album. Far too
many times we assume a passive role
with a song and are force-fed the lyrics
that some songwriter wants us to hear,
remember and buy. A listener gains lit-
tle from such an experience. By
assuming an active role, as one must
with Glass’ work, the music becomes
our own and not someone else’s.

There is a major problem with the

album, however, and that IS its redun-
dancy. While Glass insists that the six
songs are interrelated, forming a cycle
that takes at least two listenings to ful-
ly realize the piece, it is hard to make
it through a single side without becom-
ing bored with repetition. Glass
employs basically the same chord pro-
gressions, tempo and overall style in
each of the songs. Abrupt changes in
instrumentation and vocals, while on-
ly slightly varying the mood, are com-
mon to many. This problem is partial-
ly offset by the throughly composed
quality of each piece, which Glass has

    

FEARGAL SHARKEY
Feargal Sharkey
A & M ‘

With Eurythmics’ last record Be
Yourself Tonight, Dave Stewart revived
the band from its droning electronic
depths. Kicking the record into gear
with songs like the ecstatic, pulsing
“Would I Lie To You?” and the steamy
“lt’s Alright (Baby's Coming Back),”
Stewart and partner Annie Lennox
created some of their most interesting
music. While still tinkering with tech-
nology, Stewart aids singer Feargal
Sharkey as producer much as he did
with his band by leaning toward tradi-
tional rock and soul-based music that
backs the former Undertones front-
man’s voice on his eponymous titled
debut solo album.

And what a voice Sharkey posses-
ses. The singer’s raspy Irish warble
provides him with a unique instrument.
At once his voice reveals maturity and
childlike longing. Singing in numerous
styles, Sharkey seems capable of ex-
pressing any emotion.

But while Stewart’s polished produc-
tion work and Sharkey’s versatile tenor
would seem to be an infallible com-
bination, the two have some less than
stellar moments on Feargal Sharkey.
The songs the two men penned to-
gether are sometimes dull (“Bitter
Man”), and too sparse in their lyrics
and accompaniment (“Love And
Hate”). Perhaps “Don’t Leave it To
Nature" best exemplifies such weak
material, its synthesizer base never
quite jibing with the bluesy feel of the

likened ‘to Schubert’s 19th-century
lieder. Thus, while each song itself is
a non-redundant and interesting enti-
ty, the song cycle with which we are
presented is poorly constructed and
becomes nothing more than a mono-
tone collection of similar-sounding
songs.

My suggestion is to listen to each of
the six songs separately with large in-
tervals of time between them. If you
are still interested, go back and listen
to the entire album as Glass wants us
to hear it and listen for the relation-
ships between the songs. I promise
you a musical experience that we rare-
Iy have the privilege to enjoy.

Pee Wee’s
Wild Girl

WILD CHILD
E.G. Daily
A & M Records

You might have caught a glimpse of
bikini-clad E.G. Daily in the film Valley
Girl -- she was the buxom blond with
the raspy Valley Girl twang who en-
ticed all the boys by shaking her mile-
a-minute knockers. So when she
teases, Hey there Rocky/ Pretty boy
F?ocky/ Wanna be my love tonight, it's
hard to tell whether E.G. Dai|y’s
leading Rocky on or is serious about
wanting him, and that’s one of the tan-
talizing excitements about Daily’s
debut album Wild Child. On the disc,
she’s at the age of leaving behind her
teen-age frustrations, but it’s clear
she’s still got enough little girl in her
to want to fall onto the gymnasium floor
and scoop up some stardust.

The album’s title cut is reassuring,
if somewhat confusing, example. The
song is laced with a luscious rock ar-

song, while Sharkey sings repetitious
lyrics about a lonesome ranger. The
strangely reserved “Ashes and
Diamonds,” packed with great transi-
tions and chord progressions, is prob-
ably the team's best collaboration.

Far better, though, are the songs by
other writers that Stewart and Sharkey
have decided to cover. “lt’s All Over
Now” proves a dramatic, thoroughly
modern rendering of Bobby Womak’s
1964 hit, and Chrissie Hynde’s “Made
To Measure” sounds wonderfully
soulful, despite some lugubrious
strings. And while not as dynamic as
the aforementioned songs, Heart-
breaker Benmont Tench’s “You Little
Thief” is pleasant soul-pop. Clearly,
the record's finest pieces are “Some-
one To Somebody,” an entrancing
love song, and Maria McKee’s “A
Good Heart," which soars from the
groove of the verses as Sharkey blasts
into his upper range.

Only as a songwriter does Feargal
Sharkey run into problems on his first
album. That’s easyto forgive, though,
in the face of so much other fine
material which Sharkey decides to put
his voice to. As to whether Sharkey,
with his surprising, original singing,
can net widespread radio play seems
doubtful, unfortunately. But maybe if
he keeps finding enough exciting
material, a mass audience will realize
the expressiveness and power of
Feargal Sharkey’s singing and
duplicate his U.K. chart success in the
States.

voice Daily sings: Like a wild child/
Never caught in. the runaround. But in-
stead of probing this world of youthful
complexities she tries on us, Daily un-

fortunately settles for the easy way out;’

the song goes in one ear and out the
other. And on “Just For You," she
sings: I don ’t wanna let you go/ Cause
I've waited forever/ Just for you. The
song is surely a cliche, but E.G. Daily
sings her heart out with such convinc-
ing tenderness, you can’t leave her out
in the cold.

Yet Wild Child scores enough to
establish E.G. Daily as bankable. Her
delicate promises of hope on “Don’t

her gutsiness on Keith Forsey"s
“Waiting" (on which she insistently
threatens, I’m about to use my feelings,
followed closely by a warning like,

nad is not such a mysterious band
after all. They have been around for
over 10 years, have recorded many
albums (though never achieving wide-
spread popularity) and sing so well
together because they’re all in the
same family. That is typical of Irish
groups, especially bands such as
Clannad that take obvious pride in their
Celtic lineage. What makes this band
unusual. though. is their approach: On
Macalla, their latest LP, they have
largely abandoned their acoustic Irish
instruments in favor of synthesizers
and studio gloss. Somehow this un-

likely alliance works, and the result is
some of the most gorgeous, ethereal
music you’ll hear this side of The
Gates. On this number, the band
wisely takes advantage of the
presence of guest vocalist Bono, set-
ting up a sort of tag-team vocal line
wherein Maire Ni Bhraonain begins the
song in her quavering, melancholy
tones, then hands the melody to Bono,
who dominates the remainder of the
song, handing in a pretty impressive
performance and a sure-fire hit for the
band. Actually, though, this song's
success in this country is one of the
weirdest phenomena I've observed in
29 years of record reviewing (just a
joke — I'm only 20), but one of the
most pleasant surprises. Yes! This is
what good music sounds like! You're
on the right track!

Philip Glass: Lightning
Philip Glass may well be a genius —

at least a lot of eggy-headed people I
know keep telling me that — but he
can’t write a pop song to save his life.
But then, perhaps he’s not trying to
write pop songs. That's fine, but
please tell me what it is he’s trying to
do. Whatever his ambition may be in
creating this sort of pretentious,
gutless garbage, he has failed utterly.
His songwriting co-conspirator here is
Suzanne Vega, who thus reveals
herself to be the nothing I've always
suspected she was. From Glass’
“pathbreaking” new album. Yeah.

awful lot like “Sidewalk Talk," it still
gets your feet tingly.

Harold Faltermeyer also produces
four of the album's cuts, including
“Love In The Shadows,” a ballad that
sounds as if it bounced right off the
soundtrack to Flashdance. Still, Daily
hits the emotional bull's-eye, turns
around and throws another dart, and
hits it again. E.G. Daily co-produced
(with Rick Ramirez) two of the harder-
edged cuts from Wild Child. On “Hey
There Rocky," Daily seems to have
the most fun — you can almost picture
her tossing around a beach ball in the
ocean with some friends when Rocky
walks by. But for her, Rocky is not an
obsession, just a passing fancy. She
doesn't want to dance with him; she
wants to annihilate him. “Little Toy"
finds her in the Pat Benatar-you're-not-
gonna-mess-with-me light: I've had
enough/ Can't run me by remote con-
trol. You keep playing with the wrong
buttons, baby, she sings, and as if

  

T"
cgrecaéakza

that's not enough, she warns her
paramour once again: You play my
heart with all the wrong methods, baby.

Daily and band members retain their
identity throughout Wild Child; no mat-
ter how much the choruses on the ti-
tle cut annd the lonely “|s Anybody
Home" may bring to mind Stevie Nicks
cruising the galleria, her sound clear-
ly remains her own. Nowhere is this
more apparent than on Daily’s cover
of Donna Summer's “Sunset People,"
a lonely dance down Sunset Boulevard
with an evocation of that lost, but
spirited, L.A. romanticism (Foreign
cars/ Full of stars/ Tinted glass to hide
the scars/ On sunset).

“E.G. Daily proves that her enor-
mous versatility is the key to her suc-
cess," said Jellybean Benitez, “and
I've got a feeling we're going to see
and hear a lot more from her before too
long." True, on Wild Child, E.G. Daily
shows such a wide range of emotions
without one standing out over the
other. Also true, judging from the
material on Wild Child, this girl was
born to be wild.

on the Lovebug

HOUSE ROCKER
Lovebug Starski

Now, I'm the kind of guy who likes
a good rap, but I was so disappointed
by what I heard on this record that I felt
the need to write my own song. Believe
me, this one’s better than anything on
this album:

Starski Stinks (rap by Jam Master Joe)
I first heard the Lovebug about a year
ago,

I thought he sounded all right — it just
goes to show

'Cause when I bought this record I
yelled, “Oh no!

He's just a cheap imitation of Kurtis
Blow."

So when I looked at the jacket, it was
no surprise

That most of the songs were written by
Kurtis and the guys

But the thing that really struck me as

(96%

       
     
   
     

being wrong
Was that Starski didn't write the words
to a single song

Now if a rapper's gonna sing someone
else's tune

He better bring down the house, he
better know how to croon

But the Lovebug's boring, he's an old
hat

Besides, the words are stupid; the
rhymes are flat

Like the song, “Amityvi|le," they play
on WPTS

This little ditty’s even worse than the
rest

He was ripping off the “Monster
Mash” and said, “Aw heck,

I'll make it more stupid and rip off Star
Trek"

So why don't you take a good piece of
advice

Don't buy this record at any price
Cause this Lovebug ain't no “House
Rocker"

And if you buy this album you're a real,
real sucker.

e Godspell 

By Susan Washburn.

Pittsburgh Playhouse is currently
running a production of Godspell that
is entertaining, though not flawless.
Overall, the energy level is high and
the cast conveys the childlike in-
nocence intended by the playwright.
However, at times the deliberate at-
tempts to be cute or funny become ir-
ritating, due to their exaggeration.

In general, the storytelling was
creative and fun to watch. Several cast
members excelled in adopting the dif-
ferent personalities as they acted out
Jesus’ parables. Probably the most
talented of those on the stage was
James McCrum as Jesus. His ability
was evident as he assumed the many
different attitudes and speech patterns
of the variety of characterizations. Kim
Cea was the other performer capable
of handling the various parts.

In is unfortunate that the musical

numbers were not staged as well as
the parables. The sound system and
musicians combined to produce
fabulous background music. However,
most of the songs were uninspiring
due to the use of a hand-held
microphone, which inhibited the move-
ment of the cast member singing. The
only moves done with the microphone
in hand were wriggling, walking and
one-arm movements. This led to the
demise of some of the best Godspell
songs, including “Light of the World”
and “Turn Back O Man.” Besides
limiting movement, the use of micro-
phones also produced an uneven,
splotchy sound. A small number of
songs were well done, the most effec-
tive being “By My Side," sung by
Janice Jarabeck and Angela Garrison.
Both girls appeared confident in their
abilities as singers and could project
throughout the auditorium even when
away from the floor microphones. Jim

because it goes almost unnoticed. But
I find it impossible to think that it wasn't
a deliberate brainstorm on Verdi's part.

Showcase: Could the libretto stand
by itself without the music and be a
theater piece or literary work that could
be read in and of itself?

Shaldlin: No, librettos were never
poetic enough on that level but were
written to be musically directed to the
audience. The language used is often
mundane with a lot of obsolete and
literary words, with stilted syntax. It's
often awkward and doesn't read well.
It's not Dante.

Showcase: What could an opera
novice do to insure that he or she bet-

ter appreciates and enjoys the per-
formance of La Forza?

Shaidlinz One of the things they

i could do is very simple — getting to

know the plot by reading a synopsis of
the opera two or three times before
coming to the performance. Books,
such as Milton Cross’ Story of the
Opera, can be found in the library or
at bookstores and give concise
outlines of the plot. These are ex-
cellent sources for familiarizing
yourself with the opera. And if you
have more time, you could read the
libretto while playing the opera record-
ing at home or the library. The pro-
grams we pass out to the audience

to be a solicitation of a universality
through myth, ritual and symbol, as
Culture Club had begun years back,
but through a “direct and overt” ap-
proach vis-a-vis “high-energy, dance
rock,” ‘not bubble-gum pop.

Visually, they have also drawn from
non-white cultures and environments.
Their attire grew out of their English
upbringing — “Street Fashion" — ac-
cessorized by icons representative of
their mythological concerns. Donning
Middle-Eastern crosses, charms and
semiprecious stones, they have
become referential of their philoso-
phies, antiquated in their guise.

Force of Destiny

also have excellent plot synopses.
Having a good operatic experience in-
volves an awareness of the plot and,
ideally, of some of the musical
highlights, too.

Showcase: And then there's Op
Trans!

Shaldlin: Yes, with Op Trans, the
literal translation of the opera is pro-
jected above the stage and is
analogous to subtitles in a foreign film.
lt’s not obtrusive because it's pro-
jected above the stage during the per-
formance and can be ignored. But if
you want to read the lines, you also
have that option. I think it helps
enhance the opera experience.

Showcase: What operas would you
recommend to someone who might go
to La Forza and decide that they real-
ly like it and would like to learn more?

Shaidlin: Well, there's a very for-
tunate thing happening here in Pitts-
burgh. La Forza will be followed by our
next opera, Verdi's Rigoletto. I'd say
try Forza but let it prepare you for the
style of Rigoletto, which happens to be
one of the most popular and beloved
works in the opera repertoire. Then
you could follow up with our last opera
of the year, La Fille du Fiegement,
simply because it's one of the only
chances you might have to hear Joan
Sutherland in person. If someone
wants to learn about opera, they've got

Likewise, their stage show utilizes the
liquidity of light for its ability to create
a mood inspirational of psychological
introspections — they use phosphines.
So while it would appear that they have
developed deep-seated meanings, it is
more accurate that these "bedroom
theologians" are interpreting in order
to make available what is usually kept
mysterious.

Performing their hit single “She
Sells Sanctuary,” The Cult with special
guest The Divinyls will be at the Syria
Mosque next Friday, April 4 at 7:30
p.m. Tickets are available in the
William Pitt Union Ticket Office, with

an excellent chance right here in town.
I mean, they could be out in Nevada
somewhere instead.

Note: Tickets for La Forza can be pur-
chased for $3 at the William Pitt Union
box office simply by presenting your
student l.D. card. There is a limited
amount of these tickets and they are

Critchfield also did justice to the
Godspell score with his rendition of
“Prepare Ye.” “Save the People”
sounded good as well.

 

The setting and costumes of God-
spell added to the fun atmosphere of
the production too. The set was a play-
ground placed in front of a Pittsburgh
skyline, bringing Godspell home, im-
plying that this miracle could happen
anywhere and at any time. The cos-
tumes enhanced the theme that we are
all children in the eyes of God. They
were brightly colored with no specifi-
cally adult clothing.

The Playhouse’s production of God-
spell is not bad; however, there is room
for improvement, especially in the
musical numters. My advice to those
considering going to see Godspell is
this: If you want to be entertained, go;
if you want good show music, buy the
soundtrack.

  

only good for the April 3 performance.
Half-price student tickets also are

available for any performance at the
Heinz Hall box office two hours before
curtain time. Also of interest, an
operalogue consisting of a lecture and
musical tape highlights of La Forza will
be conducted by WOED’s music critic
Richard Schultz on Monday, March 31.
There is no admission charge for the
operalogue.

The blue denim jacket has become
an integral part of almost everybody’s
wardrobe. it can be worn anywhere,
any season. There’s not a whole lot to
say about the jean jacket. it's just a
sturdy piece of apparel that can take
a lot of punishment. And it's American.
Too bad The New York Times
Magazine missed one of the basics of
true American style.

As I was walking around campus
this week, I was able to see how the
masses wear their jean jackets. There
are three major categories into which
most of us fall: James Dean, Sid
Vicious and Biff Collegiate. Each is

Tucked away among other small
business establishments on Murray
Avenue in Squirrel Hill is a Greek
restaurant with an interesting but
limited menu, Little Athens. This
petitery prides itself on its quick service
and is, therefore, right up the alley of
fast-food enthusiasts who might want
some diversion from a megadose of
hamburgers, roast beef sandwiches,
fishwiches and french fries. But unlike
McDonald’s, Burger King, Roy Rogers
and company, Little Athens delivers its
fare free of charge right to your door
with any minimum $5 purchase. Their

1 unique. Each tells something about the

wearer.

James Dean wearers sport the
jacket in question with only a white T-
shirt under it. They look so rough.
Along with this look usually goes
slicked hair and dark glasses. This is
a person not to be approached. He (or
she for that matter) is to be observed
and drooled over. It is a very special
person who can take and master this
look without looking stupid. If you think
you’re one of these few, try it.

The Sid Vicious crew are those who
don their torn and ragged jean jacket
with thousands (or so it seems) of pins
that range in subject matter from hard-
core punk groups to quotes from Leave
it to Beaver. The more pins the better.
There has recently been an influx of
fake jewelled pins showing up on these
jackets, too. These people are easy to

Of course, if you’re in the area, you’re
free to eat right there at the restaurant
or purchase the food to go.

But what is lost in the way of authen-
ticity of ambience and food presenta-
tion is more than compensated for by
the preparation and flavor of the food.
The motto of the restaurant, “Why go
all the way to Greece when Little
Athens can come to you?” sums up
what is best about the restaurant ——
authentic-tasting food that can be
delivered right to your door in a mat-
ter of minutes.

The prices are within a range that
make them competitive with their Big
Brother franchises. Their gyros, con-
sidered by some to be the best in Pitts-
burgh, are only $2.35. lt’s a full and
filling sandwich of sliced, spiced lamb

pick out in a crowd. Their hair, instead
of being drowned in a sea of mousse,
is cut in a, let’s say  asymmetric
fashion and has one to three additional
colors to it. i haven’t noticed these
wearers sporting dark glasses but in-
stead they compliment their jacket with
high leather combat boots. if you can
master this look  um, uh 

The final group is by far the most
popular, on this campus at least. The
Biff Collegiate look is a unisex look that
we all adopt once in a while, if not all
of the time. The jacket (preferably a
Levi’s) is worn over sweaters, button-
downs, OP T-shirts with floral patterns
and even over other jackets if the
weather is cold. The collar must, and
I repeat must, be worn up, as if it just
dares gravity. These people portray

with lettuce, tomatoes, onion and herb-
al sour cream sauce served on pita
bread. Their shish kebab sandwich is
made with the same ingredients as the
gyros, except that grilled lamb cubes
are substituted for the sliced lamb; it
costs $2.85. A shish kebab dinner con-
sisting of salad, rice, a skewer of meat
and pastry is $5.60.

A Greek salad with feta cheese, oil
and vinegar and tahima dressing is
$1.65. Artichoke salad, a foundation of
iceberg lettuce topped with canned ar-
tichoke sections with the same dress-
ing as the Greek salad, is $2.

Hommous, a pulverized chick pea
dip, is $1.40. Baba Ghanoge, an egg-
plant appetizer, is also $1.40.

buttery filo dough and resembling a

Evans sets high goals

“I want to win a National Championship”

» By Jim Urban

Sports Editor

New Pitt basketball coach Paul
Evans is on a mission. When the
former Naval Academy coach was
named as the successor to Dr. Roy
Chipman on Wednesday morning. he
explained his main priority as the new
head of the basketball program, plain
and simple.

“I want to win a national champion-
ship.“ Evans said. “and I want to do
it the right way. I want to do it with
students. and with students who are just
getting scholarships."

That is a tall order for a coach who
is entering perhaps the most impressive
basketball conference in the nation, the
Big East. During Pitt's four—year
membership in the Big East. the Pan-
thers have never finished in the top half
of the conference standings. Still.
Evans presents some impressive
credentials, and gives Pitt fans a reason
for optimism.

Navy just finished an impressive
season under Evans’ direction. The

Midshipmen advanced to the NCAA
East regional final before being
eliminated by top—seeded Duke 71-50
last Sunday. His six—year record at
Navy was 129-60. .

“I think Paul Evans’ record as the
head basketball coach at the Naval
Academy has demonstrated that he is

cept. develop that potential to its
limits."

Potential —- that word haunted Chip-
man during his reign at Pitt. With a
returning squad that features four high
school All-Americas, that same word
may haunt Evans if he does not pro-
duce some  right away. He said he

ment. He hopes the Panthers can pull
off a few upsets of their own next
season.

“I think there is pretty good athletic
talent here," Evans said, referring to
what he has to work with. “I'm not
sure if they are all students of the game,
however.“

“I think Paul Evans reeorcl as the head Basketball coach at the Naval Academy

has demonstrated that he is certainly one of the ﬁnest coaches in the country.

7 I

—— Dr. Ed Bozik

certainly one of the finest coaches in
the country.“ Pitt Athletic Director Dr.
Ed Bozik said Wednesday.

“Anyone who watched the U.S.
Naval Academy's NCAA Tournament
success in 1985 and 1986 must be im-
pressed with the ability of Paul Evans
to mold the talents of his student-
athletes." added Big East commis-
sioner Dave Gavitt. “He is an
outstanding coach and. more impor-
tant. he is a proven winner. He has
demonstrated the ability to recognize
the potential of student athletes and.
within the framework ofthc team con-

plans to have the same success at Pitt
that he had at Navy. however.

“We are going to be a running
team." Evans said. “We will try to
make it exciting for the fans and the
players as well.

“I think some of you have seen Navy
play in the last couple weeks." Evans
added. “We will try not to play like
we did against Duke (71-50 loss). and
more like we played against
Syracuse.“

Evans was referring to Navy‘s upset
of Big East member Syracuse at the
Carrier Dome in the NCAA Tourna-

That was one rap against Pitt last
season. Picked to finish third in the Big
East during the pre-season. the Pan-
thers. using a playground style of
basketball, ﬂoundered to a 15-14
record, and a sixth-place finish in the
Big East.

“Basically, they need the discipline,
and they know that.“ Evans said.
“One thing I may have going for
myself going into next season is the
way they tailed off this year with the
great players. We are definitely going
to build around discipline."

While Evans promised discipline. he“

stressed there are some holes to fill in
the Pitt lineup before any great strides
can be taken.

“There were a couple missing ingre-
dients here last season," Evans said.
“There was no legitimate center, and
I think there was trouble with the point
guard. These positions are the two most
important positions in basketball,”
Evans added. “If you have a good
point guard and a good center, you can
pull three guys out of the hall, like we
did at Navy. and still be successful.”

Evans was aware that 6-10
sophomore Charles Smith had spent
some time as center for Pitt this past
season. and said there is a possibility
that he may play there next year. Also,
shooting guard Curtis Aiken may be
tried at point guard, along with Michael
Goodson.

Thanks to Paul Evans, the word A

“promise” will once again return to
conversation about the Pitt basketball
team. In the words of Pitt President
Wesley Posvar. “We are going to have
a lot of fun together — and we are go-
ing to win.“ '

pleased with the selection of
Paul Evans as the new
basketball coach  see

As I see it

The Pitt News. March 28, 1980

By Ji 1 Brueckner

Some professional baseball players before Jackie Robinson

.lackie Robinson was an American
hero. He was a pioneer. He was a
leader. He was an inspiration to his
race. He was one of the most gifted
and most exciting players in major
league history. He was all of this and
more.

What he was not was the first black
professional baseball player in the ma-
jor leagues.

()ne point must be made clear. As far
as baseball history and records are con-
cerned. anything that happened before
1900 is more or less overlooked and
disregarded.

If you look up the record for the
highest batting average for a season.
you'll find the name oli Rogers Horns~

Well. the same can be said of Bud

Bud Fowler was the first black man
to be paid to pray “white baseball."
Although he never made it to the ma~

jor leagues. Fowler played in the

minors from 1872-I887.

Ironically. Fowler was born in I854
in Cooperstown. N.Y. the home ofthe
Baseball Hall of Fame. His first ap—
pearance as the only black player on
a minor league tezun came when Fowler
was signed at 18 by a team in New
Castle. Pa.

For the next l2 years. his career was
lost in obscurity. Baseball was in its in«

_vcar all over the country Fowler
bounced around from team to team tin
til he emerged as part of a team in
Stillwater, Minn.. in I884. As with
many other players of his era. Fowler
was only beginning to reach his prime
at age 30.

There were many who considered
him to be the best second baseman in
all of baseball. They commented that
only his skin color was keeping him
from making that all—important step up
to the big leagues.

In I886. because of a rising number
of black stars in the minors (and es—
pecial|_v Fowler). blacks were permit-
ted to play in the upper echelon of the
minor leagues (an equivalent to toda_v ‘s
AAA). and their entrance into the ma-
iors was given consideration.

By John Enright
Staff Writer

How ironic it was that Wednesday
was a beautiful. sunny day in the Pitts-
burgh area.

While Pitt students were outside
soaking up the sunshine. the Pitt
athletic department was inside. naming
Paul Evans the new head basketball
coach. erasing the dark cloud that has
hovered over the basketball program
since Dec. 18 when Dr. Roy Chipman
resigned. 1

Following Chipman‘s resignation,
the program suffered on and off the
basketballcourt. Rumors were persist-
ent of possible NCAA sanctions against
the Panthers for recruiting violations,
while the team sleepwalked to a
mediocre 15-14 record.

At the conclusion of the season the
rumor mill stirred up even more bleak
news for the program, as one report in-
dicated the possible transfers of three
of Pitt’s top players.

All of this made for a rather disap-
pointing season, especially considering
Pitt’s high pre-season expectations. But

_new head coach Paul Evans doesn’t

totally agree, sighting the Panthers’
lack of talent at the game’s two most
important positions, point guard and
center.

While Pitt fans and the media de-
nounced Chipman for the team’s poor
performance, Evans defended him.
“It’s tough to be the new kid on the
block. Roy Chipman did a good job go-
ing through that transition period,”
commented Evans. “We want to start
to make a dent in the Big East the next
couple of years and, hopefully, win a
[Big East] Championship. We want to
continue from where Roy brought the
program.”

Chipman did bring the program far,
but he was not the disciplinarian Pitt
needed to mold its “Parade All-
Americas” into a winning team.

Of course, “discipline” is the Pan-
thers’ main downfall. It is a word that
is quite often associated with Pitt, but
not in a positive sense. More often than
not the Panthers, led by Demetreus
“Me” Gore, resemble a collection of
stars displaying their individual talents.
rather than a team molded to win Big
East basketball games.

Evans is sure Pitt is aware of this
problem. “They need the discipline
and they realize that. One of the things
that may help me going into next
season is the way they [Pitt] tailed off
this year with great players,” said
Evans. “We’re going to build around
discipline and not worry about minutes
[played], but wins."

Many observers fear that Evans will
have a rough time disciplining the Pan-
thers. This is because Pitt is so much

different than the Naval Academy,‘

Evan’s former school, where discipline
isa way of life. But Evans sees it the
other way around.

“I think it may be easier [to
discipline] at this level because basket~
ball is more important to them,” com-
mented Evans. “Some of them have
higher aspirations in ‘where they want

Thotis right . ' . to go with basketball, whereas at the

_ program. Evans is a sound coach with

“MAGIC portantly, he has his priorities straight.

“When reality sets in, basketball is
secondary to education, and it’s sup—
posed to be fun for the kids and the
people who watch it," added Evans.

Aiken pleased with new coach

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt point guard Curtis Aiken is
elated with the naming of Paul Evans
as the team‘s new head coach.

"I spoke with him when he first
came here." Aiken said. "and he said
he was very disciplined. and that‘s
what he believes in. I believe in his
style and I think we can win with that. "

Aiken. who will return to play his
senior year under Evans. said he will
play any role the former Midshipmen
coach wants him to perform.

Aiken started the I985-86 season at
point guard before switching to
shooting guard, a position he is most
comfortable with.

“When I talked to him he asked me
about playing the point," Aiken said.
"Coach Evans said, ‘Do you have any
problem in playing the point?’ I just
want to play. I don’t have a problem
playing any position a coach would like
to see Inc at. A lot of people thought
I got moved to the two—guard position
because I t.lidn‘t want to play the point.
That \\asn't true at all. I told him I‘ll
be happy to play anywhere he wants me
to. I just want to help the team win.“

Aiken said he believes Evans is the
man who can help the Panthers fulfill
their potential.

Pitt finished only 15-14 and 6-10 in
the Big East this season despite having
been predicted in the pre-season as
possible contenders for the conference
title.

Aiken said he became aware of

 

Evans’ coaching ability in the NCAA
Tournament where his Navy squad
strolled into the final eight before be-
ing eliminated last weekend by top-
ranked Duke.

“I thought he did a great job at
Navy." Aiken said. “I don't think they
have as tnuch talent as we do. If he can
do the things with them that he did, I’m
sure he can do sortie things with us."
Aiken believes Evans’ disciplinarian
philosophy will affect the Panthers in
a positive way.

“I think we cart come in here and
stress his philosophy in our minds,”
Aiken said. "And I think we can react
in a positive way. This past year was

just an unusual situation. We definite-

ly didn't get a lot out of it. But we did
get something out of it; we know what
it takes to win."
