Students might feel
e°°n°my'sW'I’ath

Staff IV/'iter

Stock market variation, aehous-
ing crisis and a credit crunch could
make it more difficult for students
to take out loans and ﬁnd jobs, but
there’s reason to not give up hope.

' _“Hang in there. It’s a lot like
ﬁshing,” said Pitt economics pro-
fessor David Dejong.

Even before the Dow Jones
Industrial Average regained almost
500 points yesterday, Dejong said

i that the average American town,

city or collegecampus might not

tumble the sarneway \Wall Street

did on Monday, when the market
plummeted more than 700 points.

Dejong said that a majority of
parents set aside money for their
children’s tuition far in advance.

While many parents place money _i

in the market, these types of in-
vestments usually aren’t suscepti-
ble to the type of swings the mar-
ket demonstrated’ yesterday.

“Most of the time,” he said,
“when the time comes to with-
draw on investments, they will
be in a safe and secure place [an
investment with levity instead of

growth], so events like those. that i

went on yesterday +— and let’s face
it, not just yesterday, the trend

for the year  not hurt as

muc .” » . 9
Students who pay their own tu-

ition bills, however, may ﬁnd it dif-

ficult to scrape up the money.

“The problem is the lack of ' ‘

funds for borrowing’ _said De-
Jong. “\X7ith the bank loans so tied

intoithe market’s movement  it t

becomes-hard to get loans of any
type, including student loans.” '
This could also affect small

businesses that require a large op-~ S

erating budget and_ rely on credit.

” Students may have problems - S

ﬁnding jobs after they gradu-
ate, said  Matychak, ‘ director
of Pitt’s Career and Leadership
Development Center.

Islamic Center, Shields
honor An—Nas Day

by Caitlyn Christensen
Staﬂ Wrder

Chaplain David McCarthy
stood at the door of the Islamic
Center of Pittsburgh on Sunday
night, An—Nas Day,  guests
of all denominations as they re’-
moved their shoes before 
the mosque. ’ ' 

“Todayis to show thatall of us
really can live together inside Pitts-
burgh and make this a beautiful
communityf ’ said Mtﬁarthy.

The Islamic Center opened in
observance of An—Nas (Human-
ity) Day, a part of the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan. Visitors and
guests watched members of the
Muslim community perform the
Maghrib, the Sunset Prayer. Some
broke the Ramadan fast with

. them.

 is "one of the ﬁve pillars of
the Islamic faith. I

For the first time at the armual
event, the Pitt-sbutgh City Coun-
cil  ancl commended
the Islamic Center for its role in
the Pittsburgh Muslim commu-
nity. President Doug Shields spoke
about An—Nas'Day?s spirit of in-
clusiveness -

“’An-Nas’ is aword that simply
means human being,” said Shidds
“It does not limit itself to a particu-
lar religion’ ’.

He called Islam a religon “that
very mudi stands for justice in the
wodd.” I

 also mentioned the
prominence of Pittsburgh in the
religious community. He said that
afterSept.11,]ewis1'i,Christianand
Muslim community leaders in the
area encouraged representation of

tions through the year

“Especiallywith all of the con-

Pitt investments diversiﬁed, more stable

Students, page 1

Matychak said that, for the first
time, even the “most desirable” graduates
are having trouble ﬁnding jobs.

“But this mainly affected students gradu-
ating and looking to go into investment
banking,” he said.

Pitt’s endowment is actively involved in
the market.

“With Pitt’s endowment,” said Dejong,
“there is only a possibility of a small annual
draw-down, something like four percent, re-
gardless of market ﬂux. What this does is
smooth funds.” _

In other words, if there is a 10 percent
market increase, only four percent becomes
available capital. The rest is reinvested into
the endowment, and likewise with market
decreases.

“Also, the University’s investment strat-
egy is pretty diversiﬁed, so a one-day drop
shouldn’t really affect it greatly,” said De-

every few minutes to check

jong.

Most of the endowment is separate from
the University’s operating budget. So, De-
Jong said he doubted it would affect tuition;
but market ﬂuctuations may affect the num-
ber and amount of scholarships offered, as
well as the available number of professor
positions.

How the market dropped

The problems currently facing American
markets are incredibly interconnected, thus
complicating any potential recovery strat-
583’-

Put simply, lenders, in an effort to in-
crease equity in home ownership, didn’t en-
force traditional lending standards and thus
distributed more mortgages than they nor-
mally would have. This produced a hous-
ing bubble, which eventually burst, caus-
ing home equity to fall. Homeowners then
found it more difﬁcult to make mortgage

payments. .
Without the income of mortgage pay-
ments, mortgage-backed securities —— es-

sentially, bundles of mortgages and invest-
ments that ﬁnancial institutions packaged

and sold — tumbled, along with many of
the major ﬁrms that traded them. Market
prices dropped because a large percentage
of American equity is tied up in its housing
markets.

In the last few weeks, the federal govern-
ment has seized several lenders and given
multi-billion—dollar loans to others.

President George W Bush proposed
a large-scale bailout that would have pur-

A chased the previously mentioned mortgage-

backed securities, repackaged them and
eventually sold them in an effort to regain
at least a portion of the multi-billion—dollar
investment.

The House of Representatives rejected
the bailout plan on Monday. Then the Dow
Jones dropped more than 700 points (to
10,365.45) and the NASDAQ Composite
fell nearly 200 (to 1,983.73).

Yesterday, it rose nearly 500 points.

Dejong, the Pitt professor, said this is

typical market behavior.

“When the market goes down,” he sug-
gests, “don’t move — you’ll miss the up-
turn.”

“You need to be patient and take your
lumps when they come. It’s like ﬁshing: If
you pull your line out of the water every few
minutes to check on tugs, you’ll never catch
anything.”

A bad sign

fit for Pittsburgh

Despite a zoning battle over a

_i large digital billboard on the side

of the new Grant Street Trans-

} portation Center, Pittsburgh of-

_ ﬁcials are considering a deal to
A place, among other things, 15
_ new digital billboards on city

property as part of a plan to

raise money for the city through
private advertising.
The plan would call for the

‘ placement of a network of elec-

tronic signs throughout Down-
town. Companies would share
ad time and revenue with the city
and, with other elements in place,

0 the deal could bring in nearly $4

million a year by 2011. Without
the billboards the projected rev-

: enues drop to $1.6 million.

But would it really be worth

$4 million to put up large ﬂashing

electronicsigns all over Down-
town? Pittsburgh’s Downtown
area isn’t very big, after all —

i less than one square mile. Plac-
T ing that many signs in a space

that small would be overkill,
speciﬁcally because Downtown
is mostly a business center and
not a major shopping or tourist
destination.

According to City Council

V documents, Pittsburgh’s "2007
1 budget was more than $430 mil-

lion, which is about 107 times
the amount we would get from
the advertising deal. According
to projected budgets, $4 million
would be enough to make up for
20'i.‘l’s projected budget deficit,

1 but it seems like there should be

better ways of [raising the money
than ﬁlling Downtown with elec-
tronic advertisements.

Let’s be honest: Pittsburgh is

, not New York, and the Times

Square philosophy of advertis-

: ing doesn’t apply here. Bigger

and brighter doesn’t necessarily

mean better, especially when the ;
city is not a major hub of adver- 
tising and popular culture. Mil— .
lions of people won’t be seeing 
these signs every day, and they’re §
deﬁnitely not going to make ‘
Downtown look any nicer. So -

why bother?
Other cities and states appar-

ently feel the same way. Akron, V
Ohio, recently placed a 120—day :
moratorium on all billboard ;
contracts within the city after 
complaints from residents about i
the city becoming oversaturated. ‘
The states of Maine, Vermont, =

Alaska and Hawaii all have bans

on billboard advertising. And, T

Sao Paulo, Brazil, banned all out-
door advertising in 2007.

There are other aspects of
the Pittsburgh advertising plan

on city vehicles and in public rest

rooms. Bill Peduto, City Council ,
ﬁnance chairman and a member A

of the panel weighing the pack-

age, wants to have the plan I-inal— P

ized and in front of City Council
before next month, and he even

wants to include projected rev- _

enues in 2009’s city budget.

0 But the project is simply in- V
appropriate for Pittsburgh, and ,

it’s just too big an eyesore.

One of Pittsburgh’s most‘

cherished and promoted aspects
is the View of Downtown from
Mt. Washington. USA Today

i even named the view one of the :
top 10 most beautiful places in _

America in 2003.

That seems like something
that we wouldn’t want to spoil,
especially with something as
tacky as digital billboards. After

all, isn’t being one of America’s ,
most beautiful places worth $4 1

million?

by Erik I'Iinton
Colum/ziat

Something is rotten in the election
in America. This unrest is not because
elaborate ad protests of Obama
 kids about sex continually
disrupts our beloved piime—time tele-
vision. It’s not because Sarah Palin is
looking to upset pornography as the
queen of Google searches. No, it’s
because something is teriibly broken
about the way we respond to facts

Never before has it been so fast
and simple to vet our presidential and
vice-presidential hopefuls and moni-
tor the election. We have FactCheck.

. org, RealClearPoliticscom and armies

of bloggers  in their mothers’
basements who are unusually skilled
at cutting through lies and rhetoric.
YouTube gives us the ability to watch
anything that anyone even remotely
related to politics has ever said, mak-
ing gaffes and policy reversal impos-
sible to disguise. We could not ask for
greater political omniscience 0
However, the electorate is more
confused than ever. Why? Is the an-
swer as simple as an admission that
we are oversaturated with informa-

tion? It would seem like we cannot
make our minds up because every
day there is a new, hot leak 
to damage a candidate’s reputation.
Therefore, must we assume that all
the candidates are liars and cheats and
that the only option we have is to play
electoral controversy hot-potato? The
candidate who is the subject of a con-
troversy closest to Election Day must
lose, nght? It’s bad logic, but it’s all that
we’ve got.

I don’t trust this analysis This
isn’t because I have any faith, what-
soever, in the American electorate or
American intelligence, but because I
think this explanation doesn’t go far
enough.

We are not disillusioned with
politics We are disillusioned with the
entire nature of fact We are disillu-
sioned with truth.

Palin’s past can be as checkered
as a ska clothing boutique, but voters
will fight, even if the face of direct
evidence, to say that her ctitics are
misinformed. Obama can lay out a
tax plan as fiscally ridiculous as my
plan to sell lemonade in Iraq to fix the
national debt, and supporters will ac-
cuse opponents of faulty math.

Why this sad state of affairs? We
have ceased to have any faith in facts
beyond their ability to stir a contro-

MCT Campus

Facts no longer inspire faith

as well, such as ads in elevators, ‘

versy for a few days and then die
down. We should put facts toward
making full opinions of a candidate,

‘but, instead, we react and then dis-

miss Why? Because we don’t trust
the facts

We really should have seen this
coming, too. Art and philosophy
have been telling us for over a century
that facts and truth may be socially
constructed. We watch “The Mattix,”
and suddenly; “What if this is all a
computer simulation, man?” Michel
Foucault announces, “Truth is 
in a circular relation with the systems
of power which produce and sustain
it  A ‘regime’ of truth.”’ Oprah and

“A Million Little Pieces” break our A

hearts. We are swept away by para-
noia: What if I am buying into fake
truth?

So what do we do? We become
obsessed with verifying everything
that is said. Our roommates tell us we
are out of milk and we -vet the source

with precise dairy-metiics to make

sure they aren’t misleading us. Then, '

we go a step further, and we stop
believing’i'research as well. It might
be lying: Maybe some errant youth
changed theidata on Wikipedia, and
maybe the witness didn’t see or hear
correctly. Before long, our fear has
captured us, and we have lost all faith

It's never too early to start Writing your memoirs  

by Ravi Pandit

Co/tun/ziat

    

Well guys, I’m a senior. Yup, you

heard it: I’m ofﬁcially one philoso-
phy class away ﬁom being an edu-
cated person. I don’t like to brag, but
with the exception of the chancellor,
the faculty, the staff, the graduate stu-
dents, the football team, the basket-
ball team and the ﬁfth-year seniors,
I’m pretty much the highest 
guy between Fifth and Forbes.
I Despite a less-than-stellar econ-
omy — and being an economics
major in the economy —— the future
is bright I’m actually only staying at
Pitt as a courtesy. I would probably
be off making my millions if the
administration hadn’t begged me to
stay.

Most of you won’t be surprised to
hear that I put Pitt’s well-being over

my own. Many of you have come to
know me over the years as the truly
noble columnist, one who has sacri-
ﬁced entire hours so that you could
consume the hard-liitting journalism
that you so very much enjoy. I un-
derstand that you are a little fearﬁil
of what you’ll do without me next
year.

But fear not I’m  my
memoirs.

For a yet—unnamed price, you can
carry me around in your backpacks
and read my musings during lectures
or while you’re onithe can.

It’s a bold move for a 21-year-
old, but I’m a bold kind of guy. No
doubt, though, the cynics will argue
that I really haven’t done anything
noteworthy. I’ll concede that point
If you want to be technical about it,
I haven’t accomplished much in the
traditional sense I somehow doubt
that my impressive ability to watch
an entire season of “The Secret Life
of the American Teenager” in one

sitting counts as greatness, though it

would no doubt make for interesting
reading. I don’t care You need your
daily recommended serving of Ravi
Pandit, and I’m going to make sure
you have it when I’m gone. —
Theoretically,  a book
takes talent. Maybe that’s true, but I
don’t think so. I’ve read some seri-
ously stupid books in my time. Be-
sides, we’re not even  about
books We’re  about memoirs,
and that’s totally different. All I have
to do is spit out inane details about
my life, rewrite a few years and pre-
tend I wasn’t rejected by every  I
asked to the prom, and make some
vague predictions about how future
Americans will interpret my life after
I’m gone. It’s really not that hard. Just
because the future technically hasn’t
happened yet doesn’t mean I can’t
make guesses about it There’s actu-
ally a word for it: It’s called “weather-
man.”
All of my columns are archived
online Theoretically, I could have
fans from far-ﬂung places like Japan

or Sweden or Lancaster County.
Even in the 'Burgh, you could al-
ways just Google my name, ignore
the pages dedicated to the musician
and highly decorated CEO that stole
my good name, and read one of my
columns whenever you need inspira-
tion.

But there’s something about the
online experience -- maybe it’s the
fact that you can’t draw little hearts
around my name or let your tears of
longing for my presence ﬂow freely
onto the paper -1- that cheapens the
written word. Seriously, I seem like a
self—absorbed, talentless hack online

I’m shooting for die heavy leath-
er-bound book option. It’ll last for
decades, so you can feel confident
 it on to future generations
as a family heirloom. Though surely
any student of my philosophy will
never lack money, anyone can use
my memoir just as easily as collateral
for purchasing a third car or vacation
home. The beneﬁts of purchasing

Champion: The Ravi Pandit Story”
are as versatile as your imagination.
So it’s time to start I
haven’t ﬁgured out how I’m going to
structure it all, but I’ll probably start at
thebeginning, ﬁllinthe middleparts
and end at the present I’ll probably
illustrate it myself just because there
are so very few artists that can accu-
rately capture true beauty. Standard
stuff I think the real challenge will
be  an actor who will play me
in the ﬁlm adaptation.
V There are so many seniors who
would spend their last year at Pitt

drinking it away, skipping class,
hanging. out with ﬁiends and 
social lives. Or maybe thejfd be out
being productive,  get-
ting jobs and internships and getting
married. But not this guy.

I write about myself because I

care about you.

In the context of ﬁlm, adaptation is a
tricky and ephemeral art. Depending on
the nature of the source material, either
meticulous adherence or complete creative
interpretation could be the most effective
manner of adaptation, and failing to
strike the right balance between these two
extremes can ruin even the most highly
lauded original work.

“Choke,” based on the bestselling novel
by Chuck Palahniuk (“Fight Club”), is
another entry into the seemingly endless
class of films where adaptation just wasn’t
executed correctly. As with all of his works,
the world Palahniuk crafts in “Choke”
teeters precariously between gritty reality
and modern—day fantasy, saved from the
depths of ridicule by Palahniuk’s expert
use of language, humor and internal
monologue. Unfortunately, the novel’s

In “Choke,” Victor Mancini (Sam

them save him. He has to deal with his
mother Ida’s (Anjelica Huston) impending
death at the hands of dementia even as he

identity from her frazzled brain. Ida never
recognizes Victor — always assuming he’s

recruits Denny (Brad \X/illiam Henke), his

I of popand fun

and desperation for closure.
Each song on this track brings
a sense of relation to some event
that we all have gone through. But
it still leaves the listeners guessing
what the band will say next. With
its mix of keyboard, guitar, bass
and drum, The Morniiig Light

gives ‘the otherwise depressing

event the sense of hope.

The vibe of the album overall
is Panic at the Disco, but I doubt
that there’s- a music video with
people walking with water tanks
on their heads in its future.

Still, it’s a welcome relief
from boys in makeup crying their
hearts out and letting mascara

run down their cheeks._,,Let that

smile out.‘ Get ready to move
along with “Movin’ Along.”

The Morning Light’s single
“Clouds” sums it up perfectly:
“Take today and make my way
/ Through the toyvn, the streets,
the‘ pouring rain / ‘Cause some
days / It seems like the clouds
won’t stay away.”

Celebrate no matter what, '
- folks. It’s better than sulking.

Android may be a cheap and hip alternative to iPhone

by Donald Campbell
Colummitt

    

For quite some time, the iPhone-

has been the luxury phone of
choice for those who wish to be
hip and constantly connected. It
supports Web browsing, messaging
and _e—mail all over -the AT&T—
driven wireless network. For those
of us who have an iPod touch, these
features are only available when
Wi—Fi is accessible. For those of us
who are too cheap to upgrade, these
features are only available when
PittNet isn’t around.

Apple may have a competitor

on the horizon, though. Google
announced development of
it*§ Android phone operating
system, powered by a Linux-based
subsystem. _The Android phone
platform is perhaps the best example

Fields still recovering

by Greg Trietley
For T /ae Pitt New

Levance Fields and his oft-

ailing left foot will be ready to go ,

“when the Pitt men’s basketball
team begins its season.

The Pitt guard is on schedule
to recover from the Aug. 22 bone
graft surgery he underwent on his
left foot, according to a spokes-
man for the men’s basketball pro-
gram. ”

Doctors originally said the re-
habilitation time for a procedure
like Fields’ is six to eight weeks,
and the spokesman said Fields’
foot is healing normally.

But late last week, Pitt coach
Jamie Dixon said that there might
be some minor setbacks.

“There has been some infec-

. tion where [doctors] did the.sur-

e ,” said Dixon. “It doesn’t slow
8 1'3’

X's and 0's

down the healing, but it may slow
the rehab part of it.”

But after meeting to talk about
it with doctors and the coaches
last week, Fields appears to be
right on time.

“He’s on schedule,” said the
spokesman. “We expect him back
before the first regular—season
game.”

Pitt’s first regular-season game
is set for Nov. 14 against Fairleigh
Dickinson.

Barring any more setbacks to
his foot, Fields should return to
the team by late October. The
team will hold its ﬁrst practice
Oct. 17.

Fields first fractured his foot
Dec. 29 last season in a game at
Dayton. It was Pitt’s first loss of
the year.

After missing 12 games be-

I

cause of the injury, Fields re-
turned as a major contributor,
helping lead Pitt to the Big East
Championship title. He averaged
21 points per game in the post-
season.

This most recent surgery came
after Fields reinjured the foot dur-
ing the offseason.

He played in the Pittsburgh
summer league but began feeling
pain in his foot and had it checked
out. He then realized it was once
again fractured.

That’s when he underwent a
procedure to further stabilize it,
although he did have other op-
dons

Fields is now off crutches and
wearing a walking cast. If every-
thing continues as planned, Fields
will be the starting point guard
Nov. 14.

just for one day, let’s give Dave
Wannstedt a break.

By now, he and offensive co-
ordinator Matt Cavanaugh have
to be sick of it.

They’ve got to be sick of hear-
ing about how they’re not using
the right players, making the right
calls or targeting the right spots in
the defense —— especially because
Warmstedt and Cavanaugh know
their players better than anyone
else in the country.

_ Wannstedt doesn’t need a
break from football, the expecta-
tions or even the pressure to get
Pitt back to a bowl game. But for
one day, everyone needs to lay off
the criticism of the play-calling
and personnel decisions.

It all started after Pitt's‘ first
game, when the Panthers lost to
Bowling Green.

There were calls for more of

Baldwin's time will come

Jonathan Baldwin, the 6—foot-
5-inch freshman receiver with
freakish speed and athleticism.
There were calls for more of
quarterback Greg Cross, the ju-
nior college transfer who was

supposed to bring a change of '1"

pace on offense.

Don’t get me wrong: Those
guys should get playing time. And
at least as far as Baldwin is con-
cerned, the Pitt coaching staff

has done a decent job trying to if

get him involved.

Baldwin caught his first ball
on Saturday against Syracuse, and
it was a nice one. On third down

and nine, quarterback Bill Stullf,
hit Baldwin on a bubble screen. M

He made a defender miss and
went for eight yards, leading to
a key fourth-and—one, which Pitt
converted.

\While it was his first catch so __
far this year, Baldwin has been on 1'

the field for a good number of
snaps and has been targeted sev-
eral times.

Wannstedt and Cavanaugh.

The coaches are forced to answer more
and more of the same questions that
they’ve been getting for what seems like an
eternity.

Why isn’t Baldwin catching more balls?

How can Baldwin help expand the of-
fense?

Wannstedt, Cavanaugh and the entire
city know that Baldwin can make some
plays.

They also know that down the road
Baldwin will probably have to. But it’s a
whole lot easier said than done.

‘‘We’ve got to give him the ball,” said
Wannstedt on Monday afternoon. “It’s
tough, [though], and the biggest thing with
playing some of these young kids is [that]
it’s easier after the fact. And it’s easy for
somebody else to say.”

He’s right.

Some people wonder why Pitt doesn’t
just throw Baldwin in every play and tar-
get him with every pass. They wonder why
there isn't more of an effort to get him in-
volved.

But the answer is simple: inexperience.

Baldwin is 19 years old. And he’s still i

learning. ,

Four months ago, Baldwin was still
walking around Aliquippa High School.
Now a college freshman, he makes fresh-
man mistakes.

And it’s not like the other Pitt receivers

don’t have talent.

Derek Kinder was one of the hottest
players in the Big East two years ago, but
he tore up his knee last year and lost some

of his hype.

Kinder, a senior, is Pitt’s best receiver.
He'll continue to be all season.

Then there’s TJ. Porter, Oderick Turner
and Cedric McGee.

All three have made plays. And while
they may not be among the elite receivers
in college football, they have more experi-
ence, are more proven and are more com-
fortable in the playbook than Baldwin is.

So who should be getting the passes?
Kinder still needs the ball, and although
Turner has had a tough couple games, he
needs his touches, too.

McGee made a catch’ that might’ve won
the game for Pitt against Buffalo, and Por-
ter showed in that same game that he de-
serves the ball.

So just because Baldwin is athletic and -is

October 1, 2008

there, should these guys should be forgot-
ten about?

It might be hard to believe, but there
aren’t really that many touches to go
around.

Pitt fans can’t forget that the Panthers
are 3-1. That’s not too bad, no matter what
teams they played.

Go ahead and critique the coaching
staff as much as needed, but the truth is,

Cavanaugh and Wannstedt know their team‘

better than the fans, students or reporters.

They know the capabilities of every
player and have a goal for what the team
needs to do. And they’re better coaches and
decision-makers than most of the people
calling them out.

It won’t be easy against South Florida
on Thursday night. Who knows, Baldwin
might just show up on the field and make
some plays. Then again, he might not. If hid"
doesn’t, there’s likely a reason.

But no matter what anyone thinks, that
game, and any game in the immediate fu-E
ture, won’t simply depend on him catchingj
balls. ‘

Pitt fans should be happy about that.

Because if the Pitt football program
gets to the point in which it relies on a first-.’
year player to make the difference in the
offense, then it’ll be in big, big trouble.

Football

Wannstedt,

by Ravi Marfatia
Stzzﬁ’ WrL'Ier

Facing Grothe A
The Panthers have a real test coming up

i this Thursday night on the defensive end,
_ especially when facing quarterback: Matt

Grothe. V
Grothe, a junior, is a dual threat. He leads

 South Florida in both passing (1175 yards)
A and rushing (219 yards) this season.

The Panthers know this well, especially
after last year, when Grothe ran for 67 yards
and a touchdown at Heinz Field to lead the

Pitt looking toward South Florida

Bulls to a 48-37 win.
Warmstedt said this week that he looks at
Grothe as the Big East’s best quarterback.
Kicking it through
Not only did Pitt kicker Conor Lee hit a

school record of four ﬁeld goals on Saturday,-

but he also extended his streak of consecutive
extra points to 85. Since arriving at Pitt, Lee
has never missed an extra-point attempt.
But while Pitt’s kicking game is solid,
South Florida’s has struggled, After Bulls
kickef Delbert Alvarado struggled, connect-
ing on just one of his four ﬁeld goal attempts,

South Florida has relied on Maikon Bonani,
a true freshman. Bonani has connected on
seven of his 10 field goal attempts so far this
season. - '

Stephens-Howling takes, over

Pitt tailback rtsetm McCoy rushed rot sf

season—high 149 yards on 28 attempts on Sat-
urday against a Syracusedefense that ranked
102nd in run defense. LaRod Stephens-
Howling also provided two touchdowns. But
Stephens-Howling’s special teams play stood
out to Pitt coach Dave \X/annstedt

“To add to his rushing performance, his

special teams performance was excellent,” ‘
said Warmstedt. “He’s the ultimate player to '
coach.’’ ' -
Program on the rise .
- South Florida is coming off one of its

best seasons as a football program.

The Bulls were ranked as high as No. 2‘, 1,.

in the country, pulling off wins against No.
5 West Virginia and No. 17 Auburn. South
Florida also made its third straight bowl ap-
pearance against Oregon in the Sun Bowl.

But the Bulls lost handily, 56-21,. in El
Paso, to end their season 9-4.

Young's
ankle
back to

normal

Fields, page 15

Pitt senior forward Sam Young, recently
seen walking in a boot, is also said to be
healthy. S‘

People have seen Young wearing a boot
both around campus and when the basket-
ball team received its Big East Champion-
ship rings at a Pitt football game two weeks
ago. i

The spokesman said that it was just the
result of a slightly tweaked ankle.

Never considered serious, Young has
since recovered and will be ready to play.

 “Sam’s ﬁne,” said the spokesman.

ii Dixon conﬁrmed this, saying that even
though Young was slightly banged up, it’s
nearly impossible for anyone to keep him
off the court. A

“You can’t get him to stop playing,” said
Dixon. .

“We told him to take a couple days off,
but we found out he was at Trees Hall play-
ing over there. "[The ankle] doesn’t seem to
affect him. He’s better now.”

Young averaged 18.3 points and 6.4 re-
bounds per game last season en route to
numerous accolades,

He was the Big East’s most improved
player and a first-team All-Big East selec-
tion. V

He decided to return to Pitt for his se-
nior year, after considering entrance to the
NBA Draft after his junior year.
