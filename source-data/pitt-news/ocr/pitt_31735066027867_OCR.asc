Pitt picks
new food
service
contractor

Sources say contract
has gone to local

  caterer called Suduxco

rc Nuzzo & Anthon Breznican

Pitt has chosen a new food service con-
tractor and is notifying vendors who sub-
mitted a bid of the ﬁnal results, according to
oﬁicials.

Sources close to the selection process
said that a Pittsburgh food service contractor
called Suduxoo has won the contract. No
representatives from the company could be
reached for comment at publication time.

Eli Shorak, director of the negotiations,
refused to conﬁrm or deny the contract
recipient at the time of publication, but said
an official announcement will be made this
afternoon.

Betsy Sallade-Farina, Pitt’s food ser-
vice director, admitted Pitt has not been
happy with Marriott’s bid for the contract.

“Marriott will probably not get the con-
tract,” Sallade-Farina said yesterday, but she
would also not comment on the ﬁnal results.

“We felt students were interested in
other options,” she said. “The committee
was leaning away from Marriott.”

Marriott has been heavily bombarded
with student dissatisfaction over the past
several years, and Student Government offi-
cials said they support picking a different
vendor.

SGB President Justin DalMolin said he
was aware of student dissatisfaction with
Marriott, but denied knowing the results of
the search. -

“If they were to change to a caterer
other than Marriott, I hope it has an upgrad-
ed customer service policy,” DalMolin said.

DalMolin said Abdu Cole, the manag-
er of Schenley cafeteria, took necessary
steps for students, but that did not solve
problems in other cafete1ia’s — such as
Tower C-Side cafeteria and Eddies’ —

VP wants to ease college costs

Congress claims
proposal will make
tuition skyrocket

Anthony Breznican
Editor-in-Chief

A tax cut proposed by Vice
President Al Gore would save people
paying undergraduate tuition to Pitt
$l,0()()ayear—ifitgets approval ﬁorn
Congress.

But a spokesman for the House of
Representatives’ Ways and Means
Committee in Washington, D.C., said
the plan is likely to cause inﬂation and
boost tuition costs for “tens of millions”
of students across the country.

In a panel discussion in Pitt’s stu-
dent union yesterday, Gore said 12.6
million students would beneﬁt ﬁorn his
administ1ation’s Hope Scholarships and
tuition tax credit programs.

Freshmen and sophomores would
get a maximum $1,500 credit each year,
regardless of tuition costs.

Gore said undergraduate juniors
and seniors, grad students and people
working their way through school part-
time would get a 20 percent tax credit on
their first $5,000 of tuition.

The proposal would also help busi-
nesses ftmd employees’ educations,
offer student loan deductions and
encourage older people to return to
school through tax incentives, Gore said.

The incentives are geared toward
low-income families that can not atford
the rising cost of tuition, Gore said. The
program does not cover a person who
ﬁles their income at more than $50,000

a year or couples who ﬁle for more than
$80,000 a year. ‘

Like" a game show host, Gore
announced to students on a discussion panel
how much they would save if this program
passed congress.

Diane Killian, a pharmacy student at
Pitt, told Gore that her parents had a diﬂicult
time paying her graduate school tuition
because she also has sisters in college.

“According to my ﬁgures, this program
would save $4,000 for your parents,” Gore
said.

He told Anthony Gatlin, a Duquesne
graduate student and full—time restaurant
worker, the proposal could save him $2,000.

Each student on the panel described a
particular case of ﬁnancial woe that Gore
said the tuition tax credit program could
resolve.

-“I want to make the 13th and 14th years
of education as commonplace as a high
school education is today,” Gore said.
“Compared to Congressional plans, our tax
credits would help more types of and ages
of students, including older students, seek
the education they need to succeed in the
work place.”

Gore said he is hoping for bipartisan
support as the proposal enters discussion in
the conference committee, but said he
feared opposition to the plan from the
Republican Congress.

“I urge all of you to contact the House
and Senate representatives in your home
state  and tell them to support President
Clinton’s plan,” Gore said to the roorrr of
250 people.

Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the
House Ways and Means committee, said
those scholarships would likely ca11se an
inﬂation in tuition across the country.

. “Let’s say you go to a college that
charges $8,0()0 a year. If the government
gives you a tax break amounting to $1,500
a year, then what is to stop the college from
raising tuition to $9,500 a year?” said
Fleischer. “Right now.[the proposal] could
raise tuition for tens of millions of people.”

Fleischer said one way to prevent
tuition inﬂation is to keep the plan as a per-
centage rather than a dollar for dollar incen-

live.

“That way you diminish inﬂation,
while still delivering the same bang for the
buck,” Fleischer said.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said he did
not think Pitt would raise its tuition by that a
large degree in such a case.

. He said Pitt would rather keep its
tuition low to get a larger enrollment.

Gore also said the number of jobs in
industry have dwindled in cities such as
Pittsburgh, which had based its economy on
steel production. He said the future of simi-
lar cities will be determined by the type of
colleges found in their area, and the oppor-
tunities offered to people after graduation.

Gore’s visit comes just one week after
Pitt raised tuition by 4.5 percent for in—state
students and 5.5 percent for out—of—state stu-
dents.

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy said he
was concerned the tuition hike would dis-
courage students from coming to Pittsburgh.

“Clearly the universities are the critical‘
element in bringing people to Pittsburgh,”
he said in an interview. “Anything that dis-
courages students or researchers from com-
ing here is something we should be careful
about.” V

Murphy said local universities were the
key element bringing young people into the
city.

“But I understand that the University of
Pittsburgh has to pay the bills too, so that’s
why anything the government can do to
help is appreciated.”

During his presentation, the vice presi-
dent said he and Clinton insisted on a $35
billion budget allowance for this program
from Congress.

“President Clinton and I believe that it
is a good investment in America’s future,”
Gore said.

Throughout his appearance, Gore
claimed that the president’s tuition tax cut
program beneﬁts 7 million more students
across the country than Congressional
plans.
He claimed the congressional tax cred-
it program would beneﬁt around 303,000
students in Pennsylvania, while Clinton’s
would beneﬁt 545,000.

THE PITT NEWS 3

Pitt grad student Diane Killian jokes with Gore during the panel discussion.

 



  

O
Reac'|'|on  
the stories seemed picked out and set up.”

Audience members shuffling out of’
the meeting complained that they could
not ask questions, and some even said they
thought the entire event was staged.

Jenny Hanlin, a Pitt senior, was an
audience member who said she walked out
with more questions than she had when
she went in.

“A lot of questions I had went unan—
swered,” Hanlin said. ‘This seemed like a
long advertisement or infomercial for this
new bill.”

A member of the nearly 250-person
backdrop crowd seated behind the town
hall panel, Hanlin said she had the impres—
sion that she would have . — w
the chance to ask Gore at - 
least one question about his  
proposal. '  

‘ She didn’t.

But panelist and SGB
member Brandi Miller said
Gore made an extra effort
to answer all her questions.

“He didn’t have to be,
but he was very genuine
and sincere,” Miller said.

Miller stated the panel
was designed to be diverse to represent a
number of views, and it would have been
impossible to address everyone’s ques-
tions.

“I really thought the cross—section was
excellent,” Miller said.

The Office of the Vice President —
which selected the panelists — contacted
Miller after she was recommended by Dr.
Betsy Porter of Pitt’s ﬁnancial aid oﬁice.
After screening other candidates, the office
called Miller on Sunday night to let her
know she was on the panel.

Others in the audience —— like Thao
Vo, a graduate of Dickinson College in
Carlisle, Pa., and Aaron Gray, a West
Liberty State College, W.V., graduate —
said they were just glad to be there and see
that the government was making an effort
to provide educations to more Americans.

“It’s very early to say yet, but at least

 

FROM PAGE 1

they are making an effort to change,” said
Gray. “People just have to give it time.”

The duo — decked out in shorts, tee-
shirts and sunglasses, among a sea of suits
and dresses — said the fact that the vice
president was even making a visit was a
reassuring gesture.

“I don’t think he’s the kind of guy that
does things for show,” said Vo.

But Pitt nursing sophomore Laurie
Keller was not impressed by Gore’s visit.

, “If they’re going to provide more
loans, that’s great,” Keller said, but added
she was upset that everything within the
academic institution seemed to have been
frozen.

Security for the event
was backed by Secret
Service agents and state, city
and campus police depart-
ments. There was no parking
allowed on sections of
Forbes and Fifth Avenues, as
well as Bigelow Boulevard,
surrounding the Union.

“I’m annoyed that he’s
here to speak, and every-
thing is shut down,” said
  ~ Keller ,who had to make a
several block detour to stop at the 7-11 on
Forbes Avenue and get to her classes.

“I pay to be here. He doesn’t,” she
said.

Other students weren’t as perturbed by
the security measures surrounding the vice
president’s visit.

Todd Goodnight, who is attending
Pitt’s summer program and goes to
Hampdon Sydney College in Farmville,
Va., said he was impressed by the Gore’s
gesture to visit Pitt.

“It’s nice for them to show up at some
colleges that aren’t Ivies,” Goodnight said.

Goodnight, who said he came from a
small rural town, said he agrees that an
education should be available to everyone
who wants to get it.

“I don’t think money should deter-
mine if you go to college,” said Goodnight.
“Ability is more important.”

Chrysler begins massive auto recall

PASADENA, Calif. — After lingering for
several hours with a rock nicknamed “bar—
nacle Bill,” the Mars rover “Sojoumer” has
been directed to visit a bigger rock — called
“Yogi” —— about six feet away.

NASA officials say Sojourner will
make a stop along the way to do more soil
analysis and then take a picture of “Yogi”
before actually going to visit.

CAPITOL HILL — The curtain rose yes-
terday on the most extensive investigation
ever conducted into the ﬁnancing of a presi-
dential campaign.

The Senate governmental affairs com-
mittee opened hearings into campaign fund
raising —— in particular on how the
Democrats raised money during the last
election.

There will be questions about overnight
stays in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White
House and the possible role of foreign

money in the U.S. presidential race. The ﬁrst '

witnesses are expected to appear today.

WASHINGTON — Swarnped by thou-
sands of complaints, the Federal
Communications Commission is looking
into slamming.

Slamming is the practice of switching
people’s long distance service without their
permission.

Regulators may propose ways of crack-
ing down on the illegal practice as soon as

DETROIT — Chrysler is making plans for
safety recalls of more than 1.6 million cars

and trucla this summer.

There are several problems that need to
be ﬁxed, including faulty air—bag controls
and minivan lift-gate supports.

It’s the largest action of its kind by a sin-
gle automaker this year.

A spokesman says the biggest of the
recalls involves about 850,000 Dodge Ram
pickup trucks ﬁorn the years 1994 through
1997 and Dodge Ram Vans and Ram
Wagons from 1995 through 1997. They’re
being recalled because heated transmission
ﬂuid can melt connections on the ﬂuid lines
— posing a potential ﬁre hazard.

The company says it’s received reports
of 50 ﬁres thought to have been caused by
the defect. No one was injured in the ﬁres.

BOULDER, Colo. — A Bible passage
could provide a clue in the Jon Benet
Ramsey murder investigation.

The Rocky Mountain News reports
police are exploring a possible link between
a ransom note and Psalm 118. The note
demanded $118,000 for the six—year—old’s
retum. That’s also close to the amount of her
father’s 1995 bonus.

Averseinthepsalmcontains thephrase
“bind the sacriﬁce with cords.” Jon Benet
was strangled with a cord in late December,
and her wrists had been tied.

The bible passage was reportedly famil-
iar to the girl’s mother, Patsy Ramsey, due to
a book she had read about surviving cancer.

Boulder’s police chief refuses to com-
ment on the possible connection.

where he said the real problems lie.

DalMo1in said that to change Marriott,
“You’d have to change it from the top down.

“You’d have to change caterers to do the
job  starting with a customer service policy in
the new contract,” DalMolin said. “That is so
student complaints can be pinpointed to the
person responsible.”

Shorak said in past interviews that the
search committee was looking for a contractor
which could adapt to changes in the “block”
dining plan, or eliminate the plan altogether for
another option. He said quality and cost issues
were taken into consideration, as well as how
the new contractor will beneﬁt the campus.

The new food contractor will also be
responsible for upcoming changes to the Roy
Rogers eatery in the Cathedral of Learning.

“Until we notify the vendors, we can’t say
too much,” Shorak said, but added that the
decision is “good news for the University and
the students.”

Shorak said Pitt is looking to have the
details of a contract settled by August 1 and
hopes to negotiate a ﬁve—year food service
deal.

Gore's town
  hall meeting  
was a chcrrcide

Al Gore’s town hall meeting yes-
terday was a waste of our time.
Questions that appeared contrived
and planned oozed from a panel that
included carefully selected students
who showed no intention of asking
any tough questions. ‘ .

Every panel question and its
answer seemed to be the same. To
paraphrase it all, they went some-
thing like this:

My name is so—and-so, and my
situation is such-and-such. Will the
president's new plan help me, too?
the panelist would ask.

Well, gee golly! Under the presi-
dent’s new plan, you ‘d get a $1,500
tax break! came the vice president’s
seemingly surprised response each
and every time.

This was one of the most lame
photo, opportunities we have ever
seen at this school. The questions
were obviously carefully orchestrat-
ed and contrived to make sure that
Gore had an easy ride in front of the
microphones and cameras.

We have a suggestion for the
White House press staff: If the meet-
ing has to be like that, then next time,
just send out a press release. It does
no good to have a public show for a
free press if the press isn’t free to ask
questions. ’

And there are plenty of tough
questions to ask Gore. The most
important may be: What is to stop
Pitt from raising tuition by $1,500
when they find out that every student
is getting a $1,500 tax break? After
all, we paid a particular amount of
money to go to school here this year,
so why wouldn’t we pay the same
next year while Pitt takes an extra
$1,500 from the government?

Tough questions like these need
to be asked. That’s what a free press
is for. We at this paper, and the other
journalists covering the presidential
administration, have a responsibility
to ask the hard questions, and when
we are invited to a press conference,
we expect to get answers. Our read-
ers expect and deserve at least that
much.

If the vice president and Pitt’s
administrators are looking for a
photo opportunity, they should buy
advertising space.

Guns don’t kill people; people kill

doesn’t it make sense that we should
attempt to keep the people who would kill
people away from the instruments that
would help them do so?

The July 2 issue of The Pitt News ran
an editorial that lambasted the Supreme
Court for, pardon the pun, shooting down
the Brady Bill. The Brady Bill is a piece of
legislation that was purported to institute
gun control. However, the Brady Bill was

in violation of the 10th Amendment, and it -

is my belief that it was purposely written to
be so.

The problem with gun control legisla-
tion is not the method of interpretation that
is used to determine its constitutionality,
but in the ﬂaws that are put in the legisla-
tion by Congress to keep it from becoming
a reality.

First of all, the Second Amendment,
which guarantees the right to bear arms,‘
was not the issue at hand when the Brady
BillcamebeforetheSupremeCourtas was
alludedtointheJuly2editorial. Itwasthe
10th Amendment, which states that “the
powers not delegated to the United States
by the Constitution, not prohibited by it to
the states, are reserved to the states respec-
tively, or to the people.” Nowhere is it stat-
ed in the Constitution that the federal gov-
ernrnent has the right to mandate that local
governments set up databases on which to
keep a record of who can and cannot pur-
chaseguns.Therearetwoinherentﬂawsin
this concept that render the bill inept.

First is the blatant unconstitutionality
of the federal govermnent trying to create
laws regarding local government without
express constitutional permission. I believe
tliatthiswasdonepruposefullytokeepthe
legislation from being deemed acceptable
by the Supreme Court, thereby passing the

try.

Congress doesn’t want to tick off the
people who want gun control. So, it passes
a piece of legislation that supposedly will
give them gun control. However, Congress
also doesn’t wantto tickotftheNRAthat
gives them big bucks and is one of the most
powerful PACs in the country. So, it makes
thebillonethatwillnotmakeitbythe
Supreme Court. Therefore, everyone else
gets screwed, and Congress comes out
smelling like a rose. “It wasn’t our fault.
Blame the Supreme Comt,” they say to one
sideofthespectrum,t1nntotheotherand
add, “We knew it wouldn’t do any harm”

The second ﬂaw concerning this

will not be an effective measure of gun
control. As the system would not be feder-
ally funded or instituted, it would be highly
probable in the system outlined by the

The only kind of worthwhile gun con-

Kuralt was more than just ”a reporter”

 

Charles Kuralt said he was never a real

reporter. ‘

I am inclined to agree, even though I
admired him more I did than any other jour-
nalist. No mere reporter ever worked words
as well as he did. A mere reporter never found
such subtle poetry in so many people and
places across America.

He died last Friday, the Fourth of July.
The man who had made so many trips across
America documenting its people, passed
away on its birthday. There is a subtle poetry
in that too.

Kuralt started roaming the country in
1967, reporting stories about 104-year-old
entertainers, musical saw players and railroad
car engineers —- stories, one might think, that
could be found at any crossroads.

“They’re people you know,” he once

said. “But they’ve never been on the front _

pages.”

His show was called “On the Road.”
Kuralt, with a photographer and a sound man,
patrolled the back roads of 50 states, follow-
ing story leads, but always hoping for “some-
thing more interesting along the way.”

He covered the history of America, the
quiet solitude of its countryside and the
unique comforts of its people.

He did these things while other journal-
ists covered race riots, the Vietnam War,

assassinations and Watergate.

That’s why he said he was “never a real
reporter.”

That’s why I think he was one of the
nations most important journalists.

In an era when society seemed to be
falling apart, Kuralt showed that much of the
country had kept its sanity.

He knew the news was not just about
catastrophes and governments. It was about
the state of the world. While some of the
world was chaos, it was important to show
that much of it was still peaceful. A

He gave America a face in a California
woman who had 100 hummingbird feeders
strung along her porch. “I can’t save the
world,” she said. “I can help out the hum-
mingbirds.” A

His words gave America a soul:

“In April of [1968] Martin Luther King
Jr., was murdered, and several American
cities erupted in ﬂames. In June, Robert
Kennedy was murdered.  I might have
thought the country was going mad if I had-
n’t been on the road. I had eyes and ears. I
kept running into people who made me feel
conﬁdent and reassured.”

Kuralt passed that conﬁdence on with his
baritone voice and pumpkin 

He was able to draw compassion, curios-
ity and optimism frorri all of his subjects. He
epitomized the ﬁnest qualities of the people
he captured on ﬁlm.

For many years before “On the Road”

was ever a dream, Kuralt was a foreign cor-
respondent. He recalled covering the begin-
nings of a war in a tiny country called
Vietnam. That recollection paints an image of
not only the reporter, but also the man he was.

He followed a South Vietnamese pla-
toon, lead by a man called Lt. Son, into the
jungle. The platoon fell under heavy ﬁre, and
many soldiers were killed. When the grmﬁre
stopped and the jungle was quiet, Son stood
to give new orders to his troops. I

A single shot pierced Son’s brain, and the
soldier pitched forward into Kuralt.

“The wound looked so small at ﬁrst,”
Kuralt recalled in his memoirs. “I cradled his
head on my chest. I picked up a handful of
leaves from the ground and tried to stuff them
into the wounds to stop the bleeding.”

Sometimes there is nothing you can do.
Sometimes fallen leaves are not enough. But
when I see the brilliant oranges and reds that
provided background for so many of his “On
the Roa ” reports, I think maybe they are.

A journalist can not undo damage once it
is done. All we can do is mix the bad with the
good, the happy with the sad, and hope that it
all comes out even in the end.

I wouldn’t have as much faith in the
goodness of people if it weren’t for Charles
Kuralt

I wouldn’t be in this business.

Anthony Bnemican thinks that travelling is a
good way to maintain oneis sanity.

China: Most

 

There is a country where men and
women are arrested and detained for partici-
pating in non—violent protests. Authorities in
this country go school to school ordering stu-
dents to join the state church. Students who
refuse are kicked out. In this country, nuns are
detained, beaten and raped. Women in this
country are chased down and forced to have
abortions. There are also huge re—education
camps, where detainees are executed and
their families forced to pay for the bullets,
while guards take many of the remaining vic-
tims’ organs to sell abroad.

Sound like Germany, say around WWII?
In fact, these are just some of the reports com-
ing from a country that we have given Most
Favorable Nation (read: normal) trading sta-
tus. That country is China.

To be fair, China has denied many of
these allegations. But after witnessing the
brutal Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989,
and the fact that China still refuses to allow
the International Committee of the Red Cross
free access, China has made it very difﬁcult to
trust it. .

China has improved slightly in recent
years, with limits on the ability to declare
martial law ‘and limits to police detention.
Still, progress is far too slow. The CCP, the

comrninst party’s police, defends its record,

(Un)fcrvorcrb|e Nation?

saying that the U.S. is interfering in what is an
internal Chinese rrratter, in order to hurt
Chinese inﬂuence in Asia The U.S. is also
concerned about the Chinese adherence to the
human rights doctrines which it has signed,
such as the UN Charter of Universal Human
Rights and the Vienna Declaration, among
others.

These actions should come as no sur-
prise. Clrina has also broken agreements by
selling weapons of mass destruction to Iran

and Pakistan, by undermining democratic.

reforms in Hong Kong and by cracking down
on dissidents during visits by Hillary Clinton
and Warren Christopher. And, with concur-
rent investigations of whether the hierarchy in
the Chinese government sold AK-47’s to U.S.
criminals and attempted to inﬂuence the U.S.
elections, China could be implicated in
attempting to subvert the United States.

It is clear that China has displayed disre-
spect for international law. The U.S.‘contin-
ues to grant China MFN, saying that eco-
nomic growth will move China toward
democracy, yet there is little evidence that is
happening. The policy of ignoring a rebel-
lious state didn’t work in WWII, and it won’t
work now.

- Why has the U.S. not acted sooner?

The answer is money.

Most analysts agree that the Chinese
economy will soon be the largest in the world.
Any company pursuing a global strategy

..... ..- a

must look into China. Actually, all 50 of the
top U.S. Fortune 500 operate in China.
Though there is a trade deﬁcit of over $35 bil-
lion, it is mostly in clothing, footwear, toys
and electrical machinery, which would be
produced overseas anyway. Cheap Chinese
labor keeps consumer prices low, and U.S.
businesses are depending on proﬁts from the
fastest growing economy in the world.
Especially impacted are the aircraft, phos-
phate and manufacturing industries.

Removing MFN will not be a win-win
situation. Even the slightest change in the
fragile relationship will hasten the end of the
economic recovery that we are enjoying
today. No one wants to go through another
recession like we experienced in the early
‘90s, especially politicians who hope to be re-
elected. But it is cheaper to take short-terrn
losses than to have to prepare in the long term
with a rebellious China.

For us, the short term losses will be bad,
but we will survive. But can the CCP? U.S.
trade represents 9 percent of the Chinese
GDP. Considering that rebellious peasant
incidents are on the rise, and the fact that the
government has retreated from its communist
ideology, the only legitimacy for the oppres-
sive government is the economic explosion.
So, even were we to remove MFN, this does
not necessarily mean that all proﬁt from
China will end. It just gives the U.S. govem-
ment more ability to use tariffs to collectively

bargain with China.

We are holding all of the cards. The
Chinese cracked down on copyright infringe-
ments when the U.S. threatened them with $1
billion in trade sanctions. There is no reason
to think that they would not listen again.

This is not a call for the U.S. to police the
world. International Law violations occur in
Indonesia, Turkey and Nigeria, all of which
receive MFN privileges. The U.S. must pick
its battles, and China is the most distinct
threat to our national interests.

The empowerment of China does not
only represent a challenge for our future eco-
nornic interests, it also represents a challenge
to the principle of the New World Order in the
next millennium. The lone remaining super-
power must ﬁnd a way in the future to engage
both challenges, not one at the expense of the
other.

Women authors fantasize about finally
getting a chance to play with the boys’ toys

Sarah Lolley

When the little boy

family jewels in the closet
of his parents’ house, I
wondered what made him
special enough to have
such an accessory. Would I grow one too? ,

Fiona Giles’ book “Dick for a Day” asks
55 women from all walks of life to fantasize
about what they would do if they were to find
themselves in possession of a penis for just
one day. If Freud were alive, he might be sur-
prised to discover that not all women View
men’s sexuality with the same sense of
“envy.”

In fact, many of the writers’ fantasies end
with a feeling of relief that their harrowing,
gender—bending ordeal is over. Tricia
Warden’s story “Shhh” is a dark depiction of
men’s raunchy primal urges; when Warden’s
character finds herself with brand-spanking-
new genitalia, she uses it to expose herself to
dirty cab drivers and rape a bartender. The
story is a harsh look from the female point of
view at the abusive tendencies male impulses
breed.

Other selections are less brutal and more
tongue—in-cheek, making it their goal to strip
away the nonsensical social platitudes that

result from political correctness. A poem by
the pseudonymous “Senator Sin” enti-
tled “1-800-YOR-DICK” tells of a
metamorphosized woman who gets sick
of being the one “dicked over” all the
time. With her new phallic weapon she
gets a promotion from her boss, then
screws both her secretary AND her
boyfriend’s wife — all in a day’s work.
Finally, a woman gets to enjoy man’s life
of lusty, pig—headed fulﬁllment

“Dick for a Day” is definitely not for
those easily offended or caught up in the
simple, glossy gender roles portrayed in
television sitcoms. The book is unafraid to
show that as the 21st century draws closer,
sexual boundaries are being blurred by a
surge of bisexuals and gays determined to
open the public’s eyes to a world full of dif-
ferent lifestyles.

“Dildo Envy and Other Phallic
Adventures” by Pat Caliﬁa explores the
freedom of lesbian sex, touting women’s
ability to enjoy sexual pleasure without
the anxiety of having a penis too small or
crooked. Kerry Greenwood’s
“Salmancias” uses the more metaphori-
cal approach of taking a man and a
woman, both strongly heterosexual,
and forcing their minds to coexist

Men frequently insult women with
social theories that put all women into
categories. The stories in “Dick for a
Day” allow women to turn the tables
and patronize men by examining male
stereotypes like the power—hungry
egomaniac. Carol Wolper’s “Size and

what it might be like to have a male
identity in the cutthroat world of
Hollywood. In Wolper’s story, women

manipulated for control, while men
themselves get to take over the world
with nothing more than bluster and a
loud voice.

Perhaps the book is really a laugh
at how idiotic it would be for a woman
to daydream about having a penis. The
fantasies include getting job promo-
tions, walking around with phallic
confidence, screwing women and tak-
ing a piss standing up; I have to say,
none of these perks would convince
me to give up what I’ve got now.

Anyway, like Maryanne Dever
says in “Dick for a Day,” men wear
their genitals in the middle of their
foreheads. I wouldn’t want to do that.

he Center for Overcoming Problem Eating (COPE) seeks

women who have a history of substance abuse but do not have an
eating disorder to participate in a research study to ﬁnd out why some
women who do have an eating disorder often use drugs or alcohol. To
qualify, you must be age 18 to 35, in good health, medication free
(birth control pills are acceptable), and of normal height and weight.
Participants are paid $200 upon completion of the study.

the puppet and looked for the string / I
am just one of a number of guests / that
you’ll drop after running a couple of
tests.” Patrick Warren’s violin-like
keyboards provide an eerie counter-
point to Penn’s George Harrison/Sgt.
Pepper-style electric guitar line.

Picking up on a pattern? Yes, Penn
loves the Beatles. But he never rips
them off. Rather, he writes the sorts of
songs that the Beatles might have writ-
ten if they had continued to grow and
evolve into the ‘90s — much the same
way Sam Phillips (who, like Penn,
turns in a great guest performance on
the current Wallﬂowers album) does.

As always, Penn knows how to lull
the listener into a false sense of securi-
ty. The tick-tock acoustic guitar pick-
ing at the opening of “Figment” rocks
the listener to sleep, whispering like a
lullaby sung by a metronome, and then
bursts into full volume as Penn asks,
“Do you think that love is a figment of
your imagination?”

Probably it is. But at least
Resigned is a real album, finally.

lover’s intense disgust almost as
viciously as does Dylan’s “Idiot

Wind.” Hiatt doesn’t come out and tell
the object of his scorn that “There’s an
idiot wind / Every time you move your
teeth / You’re an idiot, babe / It’s a
wonder that you still know how to
breathe,” but he does tell her, “You
took me for a ride / Well I’m crawling
out of the gutter / You hooked me
down inside / What was that you mut-
tered / Something about wishing on a
star / Or a ﬁsh out of water/ Well I
know who you are / You’re Gepetto’s
wicked daughter.”

“Graduated” can be appreciated by
those on the college circuit who realize
that there is more to an education than
can be found in a classroom. Those of
our recently graduated friends who are
having premature mid-life crises
should take a deep breath, sit down
and listen to this song over and over
again. “No amount of college is gonna
give you that jolt / The top of the pyra-
mid is holding all the volts / It’s not
high technology/ It’s nuts and bolts /
And we both graduated.”

“Run Away” is another song about
pulling yourself together and moving
on. “As he shakes his list I Something
dribbles down his chin / Can you live
like this / Just crawlin’ underneath his
skin / Better run / Run away / There is
no reason to stay / Run, run away /
Better run / Run away / Fast as these
words that I say/ Run, run away.” ‘

The music itself is rock’n’roll at
its finest. Hiatt’s excellent guitar play-
ing perfectly underscores the lyrics.
Check out the guitar’s effect on the
title track, “Little Head”. The perfectly
timed picks sound like a meowing cat
to highlight the pretty little head to
whom Hiatt is purring.

Although the musicianship on
Little Head is spectacular, the words
are what shine the brightest. Hiatt is a
lyricist on par with Dylan; though
slightly less poetic and pensive, he
knows how to cut to the chase and get
his point across.

Nolan's greed
prices him out
of the NHL

Now that the Philadelphia Flyers
have hired Wayne Cashman as their
new head coach, two coaching jobs
are left open in the NHL — the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks and the

1 Buffalo Sabres.

If your name is Ted Nolan, that
leaves one.

Here’s a hint for those of you who
might have missed the Ex—Sabre coach
running away out of upstate New
York: Quack, quack.

The moral of the story goes some-
thing like this: Never make your All-
Star goalie angry. Or, in other words,
Dominik Hasek talks, and bullshit
walks. Look who’s walking now —
Ted Nolan, the 1997 NHL Coach of
the Year who was supposed to have a
lock on the Flyers job.

Cashman is settling comfortably
with a “choking” team who just hap-
pened to make it to the Stanley -Cup
ﬁnals. Nolan is unemployed, living in
some Canadian outpost town and still
gripping to the delusion that he might
get a better offer from someone, any-
one. Swallow your pride Ted because
the Flin Flon Ice Buzzards always
have room for an extra assistant coach
if you get thatwbrate.

Cashman inherits guys named
Lindros, Heﬂallﬁd LeClair. Nolan,
well, maybe he’ll get a new snow
shovel to brave the harsh Canadian
winters. After he guidedpthe Sabres to
a 40-30-12 record and a first-place ﬁn-
ish in the Northeast Division, then
won the Jack Adams Trophy given to
the NHL’s Coach of the Year, Nolan
thought he'd be the hottest commodity
to hit the Notoriously Hokey League
since the Breathe-Right nasal strip.

Wrong. And, if you think you’re
that wonderful of a coach, then sign
the" damn contract and demand a fat
bonus

Obviously, my convictions aren’t
strong enough for Ted Nolan or his
agent. But what do I know? I’m just a
girlie sportswriter.

His own goaltender ripped him to
pieces on the 6 o'clock news. Buffalo
management was willing to offer him
only a one—year deal. Nolan wanted
security, maybe a two— or three—year
deal, along with a whole ton of money.
What he got was the big “so long,

THE
iCREAllNE

Creatine does enhance perfor-
mance, which is usually enough for
a drug to be banned. However, the
NCAA contests that a substance that
enhances performance will not
always get blacklisted. "

“Vitamins could be considered
performance enhancing, but they
will never be banned,” said NCAA
official Cindy Thomas.

But to what extent is a drug
allowed to better an athlete before it
is considered too much and unfair?

pounds of water-weight when he

to 265 in those eight weeks. This is

His love for the results that cre-

with his wife. Creatine is not cheap.
A month’s supply can cost anywhere
from $50 to $100.

“She thinks I should spend my
money on something else. I don’t
really care because she doesn’t
understand how great of a product it
is,” said Hill.

For Pitt swimmer Noah Caplan,
creatine is provided by the athletic
department for free. He is the only
Pitt swimmer to have ever used" it
and is astonished that more athletes
don’t.

“I don’t know why more swim-
mers don’t use it. I recommend it
because it gets results, and there are
no health problems,” said Caplan.

An AII-Star Pitt News Briefing

from local and wire sources
Baseball

- The American League snapped the
National League’s three-game win
streak at the All—Star Game with a 3-1
win at Jacobs Field last night. The
game’s Most Valuable Player was
Catcher Sandy Alomar J r., who
replaced starting catcher Ivan
Rodriguez in the ﬁfth and hit a game-
winning, two-run home run in the sev-
enth off of loser Shawn Estes.

J avy Lopez was the 11th player to
homer in his ﬁrst all-star at-bat for the
lone N.L. run, and Seattle’s Edgar
Martinez went deep in the second off
starter Greg Maddux.

Tony Womack was the lone repre-
sentative of the Pittsburgh Pirates and
went 0-for-1.

Boxing

0 Boxing’s most recent walking heavy-
weight scandal, Mike Tyson, has been
' dropped from the World Boxing
Association’s rankings thanks to his
suspension - in the state of Nevada.

WBA ofﬁcials said that no boxer sus-'

pended by a local athletic commission
can be ranked by the association.

The WBA is one of many govern-
ing bodies in the sport of boxing.

Evander Holyﬁeld, victim of Tyson’s
suspension-drawing ear bites, is the
association’s current heavyweight
champion.

0 Sugar Ray Leonard, recent TKO
victim of Hector “Macho” Camacho,
has withdrawn from a scheduled July
25 fight claiming he has not had
enough time to train.

After numerous retirements, come-
backs and back-to-back losses to
Camacho and Terry Norris, many
have suggested that Sugar Ray should
finally leave the ring for good.
Leonard responded to the critics by
stating that he could return to upper-
level competition after a few tune-up
fights. The July bout with Dan
Connelly was to be the first of these
contests.

Women’s Hoops

- Rebecca Lobo’s win streak is over.

Before Lobo’s New York Liberty
dropped Monday’s contest to the
Phoenix Mercury, the former UConn
center hadn’t lost ‘a game since the
1994 NCAA Regional Finals.

In between, she played in 102 con-
tests, including an undefeated senior
season at Connecticut, a stint on the
U.S. Olympic team and the inaugural
games of the WNBA’s Liberty.

speech.

In the age of greed, money, no-
trade clauses and promises of summer
homes in Bora Bora, if you win so
many games or take so many punches
to the face, Nolan felt he had to .play
martyr and fight for the megabucks.
He held out. Buffalo was willing to
give only so much to him. He held out
longer. The Buffalo suits called
Nolan’s bluff, and management pulled
the contract offer at the signing dead-
line of June 30.

Taking the bull, er Sabre, by the
horns, general manager Darcy Reiger
had the balls to ﬂy to Sault Ste. Marie,
walk up to Ted Nolan’s front door and
tell him thanks, but no thanks. Now
that’s audacity. Audacity is admirable.

But I’m not defending manage-
ment’s stance, and I never will in this
day and age, when professional sports
is becoming an owner’s game and tak-
ing away the sheer thrill of sport with
dollar signs and ungodly promises.
Instead, I’m attacking Ted Nolan.
Hasek got his chance, so why can’t I
get ‘mine?

I can’t respect someone who
wants to have his cake and eat it too. I
can’t respect someone who uses
money as a tool in an attempt to pro-
mote self-righteousness. And I can’t
respect someone who . well, I’m
starting to run out of concrete reasons.

Let me place this scenario in front
of you:

Imagine a society based on the
ideals that people awarded on the
basis of what they contribute to soci-
ety as a whole, not just to one aspect,
such as sports. If things worked that
way, Ted Nolan would get zilch.

It’s funny how things work out,
because that’s what he’s getting right
now. Zilch.

I predict that in one year, Wayne
Cashman will not win a Stanley Cup
or be named Coach of the Year. But he
will understand how he got his job and
appreciate the clout that surrounds his
position.

Ted Nolan will be homeless on the
streets of Toronto, begging for money
and telling people that he was an NHL
Coach of the Year.

And you know what I’d tell him?
“That and 50 cents will buy you a cup
of coffee in Flin Flon.”

Creatine

While he may be alone on his
team, Caplan is not the only Pitt ath-
lete using a creatine-based supple-
ment. Gary Witeska, Pitt’s strength.
coach, has the entire basketball team
on it, along with individual
wrestlers, soccer players and track
athletes.

Many wrestlers don’t use it due to
the weight gain that creatine can pro-
duce. In wrestling, many grapplers
are striving to lose weight in order to
qualify for a lower weight class.

However, the heavyweight class
has no restrictions. Pitt’s heavy-
weights use creatine to bulk up with-
out the fear of lifting themselves out
of competition. .

Mark Blount, former Pitt center
and recent draft choice of the NBA’s
Seattle SuperSonics, went from a
scrawny seven-footer who could
barely bench his weight to a sleek,
solid, somewhat-muscular athlete
with creatine use. Blount increased
his bench press from 225 to 300 in
less than a semester.

“When Mark came to Pitt, he
didn’t lift many weights, and it
showed. But with the addition of
creatine to his workouts, he became
one of the strongest players on the
team,” said Witeska.

Pitt athletes can take creatine at
any time if they request it, but they
