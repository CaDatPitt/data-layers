J Frats Agree To Cut Minor-

JACK STETLER
blocking halfback

football team is whether they will
be able to bounce back against
S.M.U. tomorrow after having been
so soundly trounced by Minnesota
last week. A 50-7 defeat such as
the one the Panthers suffered last
Saturday sometimes has disastrous
psychological effects on a team.

However, coach Charlie Bowser
feels that his team should be able
to make a much better showing to-
morrow against the Mustangs. He
stated that the players didn’t play
the kind of football they’re capable
of playing.

“They didn’t do justice to them-
selves,” Bowser declared, “And
were a disappointment to them-

selves as well as to the coaching .

staff.”

Continuing to express his keen
disappointment over~the showing
his team made last week, Bowser

Sports From lntramurals

4 ‘Athletic leaders from the twelve
fraternity houses met with Intra-
mural Director Frank Carver last
Wednesday night at the latter’s
oﬂice to settle upon their policies
for the coming season.

The body decided to cut the
less strenuous, minor sports, and
.to concentrate on those activities
which, in keeping with the Uni-
versity’s new Competitive Ath-
letics program, are most conduc-
ive to good health and the build-

_'ing of strong bodies.

As a result of this decision, three
sports; horse-shoes, speedball, and
badminton—have been eliminated

', from the Intramural program.
Volleyball will remain, as will
touch football. However, in the lat-
ter, the double elimination feature

is a thing of the past. From now
on, one loss will drop a team from
the title race.

A new form of competition,
called Military Track, will be in-
troduced this fall. Military Track,
which is nothing more than a
series of obstacle races, will be
held at the courses at Trees Gym
and at Shadyside Academy. De-
tails concerning the number of
points to be awarded for this
event or the number of men which
each house can enter will be work-
ed out at a later meeting.

There will be Independent and
Engineering Leagues this fall, Mr.
Carver announced, if enough en-
tries are received to warrant draw-
ing up a schedule. These leagues
will be run along the same lines
as the Fraternity League.

Stewart has built his olfenlsive
attack. In the past it was Mallouf,
and this year it is left-handed
Wayne “Red” Shaw.

In addition to “Lefty” Shaw, the
high-riding Mustangs have Abel
Gon_zales at tailback and Howard
Maley as their hard-plunging full-
back. All of their kicking is done
by Edward Green. Green played
second team wingback against the
Texas Teachers college, and did not
get in the ball game until late in
the third quarter, but by the game’s
end he had earned himself a ﬁrst
team berth. At one time in the game
he stood several yards behind his
goal line and proceeded to kick the
ball over the safety man’s head,
and on over their opponents goal
line.

Tom Dean, sophomore player
from Texas, will start the game
at left tackle. Dean is the ﬁrst
sophomore performer to play on
the varsity for many years. He is
240 pounds, and is six feet two
inches in height.

away from the Gopher team, how-
ever, as he stated that the game
they played against Pitt marked
them as the greatest college ag-
gregation he has ever seen.

As far as Pitt's chances of com-
ing back tomorrow and beating the
Mustangs, so Matty Bell, coach of
S.M.U. last year, stated that the
freshman squad of last season was
the best he’d ever seen. Bowser
feels that Pitt can win tomorrow
despite this.

But, the team must go into the
game willing to put everything
into the battle. Otherwise the Blue
and Gold faces another defeat.

Former Pitt Athlete  

To Coach

PAI_JL PALANZO
An important announcement re-

leased last Saturday by the Pitt
athletic board revealed that a for-
mer alumnus, Anthony “Tony”
Mazzei, has been chosen acting
coach of the University cross-
country squad. ’
Mazzei, who succeeds Carl Ol-
sen, former Panther track men-
tor who recently resigned his
position after ten years’ service
to become a Lieutenant-Command-
er in the U. S. Navy, is not new
to the cinderpath world.

After running the two-mile
event and cross-country for the
Gold and Blue during his under-
graduate years here, Mazzei was
lured into the amateur ﬁeld where
he made quite a name for himself
as a marathon runner, copping the
ten-mile A. M. A. championship
which he still holds.

The Pitt graduate of ’31, how-
ever, will not ﬁnd it easy in his
ﬁrst year at the cross-country
reins, for he has inherited, at
least temporarily, the difficult
task of ﬁlling Carl Olsen’s shoes.
Olsen, as every track fan knows,
compiled one of the most brilliant
records in the entire collegiate
circle and was tremendously popu-
lar both with his proteges and
the public, not to mention the
press.

At least, new coach Mazzei can
rely upon such returning veterans
as Bob Davis, Mark Allias, and
Bill Curtis. These three stars
should constitute' a formidable
team along with a dozen or more
prospects now working out at the
Trees Gym each afternoon. Davis
and Allias, recently-appointed cap-

Wilde Issues
Call For Varsity

Swim Members

Pitt's swimming team opens
practice next Monday afternoon at
Trees Pool with Senior Gus Wilde
playing the dual role of Coach and
Captain. Wilde was appointed Cap-
tain last summer by Athletic Di-
rector Jim Hagan when Coach Ben
Grady left to accept a Navy com-
mission.

Five key men from last year's
championship team have been lost
through graduation, so Wilde’s re-
building job promises to be a dif-
ficult one. Lost are Herb Cosgroue,
Al Samson, Joe Kaule, Joe Orloff,
and Marty Kramer.

All candidates for the varsity
and freshman swimming teams
are urged to be at Trees Gym on
Monday afternoon.
