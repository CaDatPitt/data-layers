While the Democratic candidate

according to a Gallup poll released

, S For t/2e Pitt New —

Sen. Barack Obama and
" Sen. John McCain traded

restraints during Tuesday

night’s presidential debate, ._
e» The debate, which used a

town-hall format involving audi-
ence interaction from the candi-
dates and moderation -by NBC
anchor Tom Brokaw, was the sec-
ond of three debates scheduled
beforecElection Day andthe first
to follow the voter. registration
deadline. -, 4 S‘ if
were any [st_rengths],” ‘ said Pitt
communications professor Ger-

ald Shuster. 7‘McCain’s attitude is .
.' getting ~inc-freasirfigly. negative, " es-

pecially for the office he seeks.”
S He also considered Brokaw’s
moderating aproblem.

“Brokaw was clearly not irr

command,”. said Shuster..

Shuster said that neither can-_

didate provided any ncﬁv infor-
.mation, which he identified -as

one of the reasons behind having T

debates. V

2 ‘Shuster also thought it was;

blows and ignored‘ time -

“I’m" not . exactly sure there

odd that certain topics weren’t

1 discussed. Neither the ,Ke'at:ing
scandal, which involved charges '

of corruption on behalf of Mc-

Cain, nor' Obama’s connections ‘

with Bill Ayers, whowas formerly
associated with a terrorist organi-
zation, were mentioned. _

_‘ Presidential debates, Shuster
said, should be a forum for-con-
trast and comparison, ‘but can-
didates -are becoming more and

amore reluctant to be spontane-
ous, even if this means commit-.

‘ting an occasional gaffe. T _
-‘_-‘It could be an excellent tool

to inform the electorate,”. said ,

Shuster, continuing thatlately, the

electorate is upset aboutlosing its a

regular programming. 3 ,

‘Shuster believes that Obama '
won, “but by style. [Concerning] .
substance, they were about even.” b
He added that polls have. shown‘ ‘
that the debate had -little impact _

on the minds of voters.

Pat Graham, president of the

B College Republicans, , said that
' one of the strengths of the town-

hall format was the questioning

from the audience.  .

Pitt Waited until after
recruitment to renovate

spring, said the sorority presidents

“I received a phone call during ﬁnals week
last semester  that I attend a housing
meeting for Panhel,” said Varner. .“I was 
into a ﬁnal, so I sent a younger  in the house,
not  how important the meeting was.”

Domsic said, “The  old and fall-
ing apart   needs a facelift badly.” 7 But
Domsic said she felt upset. “I understand that
the situation was one that they had to do, and
do quickly, but it still sucks,” she said. This is her
last year in her sorority’s suite -

Varner added, “As a senior, I won’t actually
see any of theichanges myself, but I do feel it
was worth it. Having lived [in Amos] before, I
can tell you that the bathrooms are  for
a revamp.” H I

The ‘University waited to  construction
until after the sororities ﬁnished their recruit-
ment on Sept. 23.

“No walls‘ are do ” said Petro. “The

. rooms are still intact, and the  are able to use

the suites for recruitment.” a
Feclele said that the University chose to delay

I the start date because “the sorority presidents

wanted to use Amos Hall for recruitment and
had  the delay.”

Now the sororities have to ﬁnd another ‘
home for their rituals, executive board meetings
and sisterhood meetings, which they previously

I held in their respective chapter rooms in Amos

Hall

Duffy said that the presidents requested the
use of rooms in buildings on campus, including
David Lawrence Hall, the \Vlliam Pitt Union
and Wesley Posvar Hall. A

Varner said, “Reserving a room was simple,
and I think our meetings are actually more ef-
ﬁcient than they were in the past, when people

move to Bruce Hall has caused its sorority resi-
dents to change their  styles.

Bruce is not aparttnent—style housing like
Amos, and many of the women have had to
get larger meal plans now that they don’t have
stoves

Sisters who don’t live in the sorority dor-
mitoiies can swipe into Bruce Hall but cannot

swipe into their respective soroiitfssuite, as -

they could in Amos Hall, said Delta Delta Delta
sorority sister Teenie Gameos.

Delta Phi Epsilon sister Rebecca Stark said,
“It is  the sorority more divided because
you do not goiinto sorneone’s suite unless you
are fiends with them.” Also, Duffy said that “to
an extent, you don’t see commuters as often as
you did in Amos”

Duffy and others are trying to remedy the
challenge and hold “sisterhood events” on Sun-
day afternoons, like gathering sisters to watch
movies.

In attempt to make the sororities feel at
home, in Bruce Hall, the University gave each
sorority a private  and  the soro1i—
ties’ letters and colors on the walls at no cost to
the sororities, said Fedele.

Also, the University gave thewomen a dis-
count if they wanted to upgrade their meal
plans because of the lack of stoves in Bruce
compared to Amos '

“We sat down with the presidents of 10 so-

_ roiities and showed them where their sororities

would ﬁt,” said Fedele ‘The presidents of the
sororities were involved in the process.”

He added that: it was the presidents them-
selves who were allowed to make the room as-
signrnents for their sorority sisters _

“We miss Amos, but Bruce isn’t that bad,”

said Duffy.

Obarna’s high polling numbers.

“The economic problems we currently

face ‘aren’t going away anytime soon,” said‘

DeJong. ‘fBad economic news is bad news for
McCain.”

A poll is .a survey of’ the general public’s 0

beliefs, but if enough of the public lies, the
statistics thrown out can be off by more than
the expected two percent

Neilsen said that 1,000 individuals are polled
each night ‘and the results given to the public
represent a ‘three—day_average of Americans

This means that results reﬂecting Tuesday’s ii

debate will not be released until tomorrow
He acknowledged that Gallup’s  of

jHaddad expresses reason

I
I

Student Government Board
 members Nila Devanath and Ryan
:Hagldad clashed at Tuesday’s SGB
meeting over Devanath’s proposal
to coordinate "a phone—banking
drive in collaboration with the
United States ‘Student Association,
an. organization that lobbies on
behalf of higher education institu— .
tions. ’

Devanath’s goal for the phone-
banking drive is to take preventa-
tive action against California busi-
nessman Ward Connerly’s efforts
to eliminate affirmative action in
states throughout the country,
Connerly succeeded in getting rid.
of race— and gender-based afﬁr-
mative action policies in 1996 with
Califomia’s Proposition 209.

is Colorado, where the state has
planned a referendum for vot-
ers to cast their ballots in favor or
against affirmative action policies.
Devanath, the Atlantic ' Region
chair in USSA and the liaison to
SGB’s diversity committee, as well
as Pitt students who volunteer for
the phone-banking drive, will urge
Colorado voters to refuse a refer-
endum that would hinder afﬁrma-
tive action in that state. Accord-
ing to Devanath, Pennsylvania is
another target state for Connerly. ,
Taking preventative action against
the referendum in Colorado, she
said, would help limit his success
here.

But Haddad rightly expressed
concern that such a drive would be
unethical. Haddad said  a follow-
up interview, “USSA is supposed
to represent Pitt students; and this
seemed like members of SGB
serving the interests of USSA.”
Haddad went on to say that he was
concerned with the idea that USSA
would be using SGB resources to ‘
conduct the drive.

Connerly’s‘ next target state I

 in USSA controversy

While Devanath insisted that;

the only ‘SGB resource USSA

would use would be the meeting
room, Haddad ‘said, “Our forum
and notoriety is a resource that can
be used for an en .”

Haddad added that SGB
should be cautious in presuming
that all Pitt students are in favor of
USSA’s actions and that the board
is obligated to represent everyone.
He suggested that instead of urg-
ing Colorado voters to take a stand
against the issue in their state, a
better use of time would be to ed-
ucate Pitt students in case the mat-
ter makes its way to Pennsylvania.

Devanath said afﬁrmative ac-
tion is a Pitt issue. “Just because
this issue doesn’t affect a majority
doesn’t mean we should ignore it,”
she said yesterday.

Devanath’s passion in this ini-
tiative is evident and indicative
of a worthy leader. But Haddad’s
concerns are legitimate and should.
be taken into consideration. To
champion such a cause on behalf
of SGB and on behalf of Univer-
sity students is unethical.

It’s also largely irrelevant be-
cause the issue is currently central
to Colorado voters, not Pennsyl-
vanians..The best route to take, at
this point, is Haddad’s -— inform
Pitt students about both Conner-

ly’s and USSA’s positions so they V

will be prepared if Pennsylvania is

\ ever at stake.
it ‘ Regardless of whether De-

vanath’s goals are worthy, Hadd-
ad ultimately deserves praise for
keeping political ethics in mind
and making sure theistudents are
included in the matter. If anything,

the controversy at .',I'uesday’s SGB I

meeting proves that the board
needs to hold more discussion re-
garding this issue, hopefully at next

_week’s meeting.

There's more to life than a Nobel Prize

 
 
 
   

by Brandon Pfeffer

Columniat

“When two armies of equal
strength can annihilate each other
in an instant,” wrote Alfred No-
bel, “then all civilizednations will
retreat and disband their troops.” \
Nobel wasn’t talking about nu-
clear weapons, but dynamite. It
isrperhaps his best-remembered
invention "out of over 350 ideas

‘he patented through the course

of his life. But instead of leading
to world peace through mutually
assured destruction, dynamite
helped create the most coveted '
award on the planet: the Nobel
Prize. 0 '

In his will, Nobel set guide-
lines to establish a foundation
that would recognize the best
achievements of mankind. With
33 million Swedish kroner that he
saved, Nobel paid for the prizes
on the interest it_ generated. This
year’s awards will be announced

this week through Oct. 13, with :

prizes being given in the ﬁelds
of medicine, physics, chemistry,
literature, peace and economics.
Winners will take home 10 mil-

lion kroner (about $1.4 million

US) and membership to a very
elite intellectual group.

Despite the aura of prestige
surrounding the” awards, there
have been some questionable
nominees since the ﬁrst awards
were handed out in 1901. Mus-
solini,'Stalin and Hitler have. all

been considered for the Peace

Prize. Shimon Peres, Yasser Ara-
fat ‘and Yitzhak Rabin shared the»-
1994 Peace Prize. The three‘ sepa-

rately laid claim toisuch accom-

plishments as shelling a village
of 800 Lebanese civilians, devel-

. oping a nuclear arsenal and ex-

pelling ethnic Arab groups from

their homes. "

“ Nixon’s secretary of state,

Henry Kissinger, won the Peace

T Prize, alongside Le Duc Tho, in

1973 for negotiating a ceaseﬁre in
the Vietnam War. The terms of
the deal were broken soon after,
however, and Tho turned down.

his prize, noting that there was still
a war in his homeland. Kissinger
accepted his award, much to the
objection of anti—war leftists who
looked down upon his secret
bombing of Cambodia and ef-
forts to overthrow the Chilean
government.

Al Gorewon in 2007 for rais-

ing public awareness of global

warming. Ironically, the ,Nobel
Committee didn’t» take into ac-
count that Gore’s Nashville man-
sion consumed roughly twice as

much electricity in a single month‘

as an average family did over the
course of an entire year. Rigo-
berta Menchu won the award in

5%

Despite the aura

of prestige

I nominees.

1992 for her work promoting
indigenous Guatemalan rights. It
turns out herbest-known work,
the autobiographical “I, Rigober—

, ta Menchu,” was ﬁlled with exag-

gerations; Menchu herself admit-
ted that she made certain changes

> to her story to‘ get her message

across. ‘ L
Some laureates’ _work has

‘ turned out to be just plain incor-

rect. The committee got it wrong

two years running’ in 1926 and

1927', when the prizes in medicine
went to people who were believed
to have discovered that round-
worms cause cancer and that ma-
laria can be used as a treatment
for syphilitic dementia. More of-
ten, the winner’s work will ‘simply

be too obscureto appreciate. The '

year 2006visaw a prize go to John
C. Mather and George F. Srnoot

for “their discovery of the black-
body form and anisotropy of the
cosmic microwave background
radiation.” Far out. I

’ Notable Nobel Prize omis-
sions include Mahatma Gandhi,
Thomas Edison and Nikola Te-
sla. Apparently neither Tesla nor
Edison ever received the prize in
science because of their rivalry
with one another. In Tesla’s case,

the prize winnings might have

made such a difference that they
changed modern technology as
we know it. In a 1908 interview
with Wireless Telegraphy and
Telephony Magazine, Tesla de-
scribed the project he was ‘work-
ing on with initial ﬁnancing from
JP. Morgan: .

“As soon as completed, it will

t be possible for a business man in

New York to dictate instructions
and ‘have them instantly appear
in type at his ofﬁce in London
or elsewhere-..'. [It will] enable its

bearer to hear anywhere, on sea .

or land, music or song, the speech
of a political leader, the address
of an eminent man of science, or
the sermon of an eloquent cler-
gyman, delivered in some other
place, however distant. In the
same manner any picture, char-
acter, drawing or print can be
transferred from one to another
place.” _ A 1 h

After funds ran out for this
project, which sounds
ciously like today’s Internet, his

A research tower was demolished

and sold for scrap in 1917.

So don’t feel sore if those
ﬁckle Norwegians pass you over
again this year. You won’t know if

’ you’re nominated, and there’s no”

way to nominate yourself. Sure,
the prize money would be great,

' but you’d also be in the company

of some of the 20th century’s
most bloodthirsty. tyrants. Or
maybe, like Tesla, you’re just way

too ahead of your own time. As‘

things stand, I’d be pretty happy
with oneof those fancy Brecken-
ridge Summer Research grants.

Considering all the attention
that national media have been pay-
ing to our current ﬁnancial crisis,
you’d be hard—pressed to ﬁnd an
American like myself who doesn’t
understand the issue inside and
out -by now. Although common
 dictate that our

legi

it seems that theyare doing just
that. ‘

According to President Geoge
W Bush, the primary goal of the
government’s $700 billion bailout
of the ﬁnancial system was to
“ease the credit crunch that is now
threatening our economy.” As far
as I’m concerned, you can’t get

' more clear and tangible than that. _

However, nearly a week after the
bill’s passage, discernible irnprove—
ments are nowhere to be found.

I’m ‘not an economics ma-
jor, but if my memory serves
me correctly, I have taken quite
a few courses on the economy
— though it may have been ecol-

' ogy, which as the preﬁx suggests,

is a nearly identical discipline to
economy anyway. Nevertheless,

I attended them religiously and‘

about them was particularly difﬁ-

lion.

At all the Senate and. House

hearings I’ve been reading about in
the papers, politicians always seem
to be throwing around the axiom
“Cleaning Up Wall Street.” As a
native New Yorker, I know how
ﬁlthy the streets can get, especially
this time of year. We are, after all,
talking about a reasonably popular
tourist attraction and a huge com-
mercial center. Keeping an area like
that sanitary shouldn’t be so com-
plicated. The sidewalk outside my

 South Oakland apartment is pretty
well-maintained, even though 70‘

percent of our pedestrians are
drunk anyway and wouldn’t know
the difference if they were walking
through a trough of owl vomit.
Remember in “Showgirls,”
when Elizabeth Berkley’s char-
acter gets arrested, but then her
friend gives the.  some money
so she can get out and go to Las

Vegas, where she’d ﬁnally make

it big? Well, that’s what I think of
when I see the word “bailout” in
a newspaper‘ article. But how ex-

actly does one bail out a bank, as
the Economic Stabilization Act
supposedly outlines? I don’t see
the feasibility here. My one banker
friend is still employed by the same

‘ bank as he was before the bill was

passed. If you’re bailing out the
banks, shouldn’t their employees
ﬁnally get to be free from the dun-

_ geon of anguish that is a job in a

bank? _

And "because the banks are
indeed still staffed by the same
personnel, where exactly in these
institutions is the $700 billion go-
ing? After I heard that the bill had
passed, I checked my savings ac-

count balance and found no dif— .
‘ ference. So if we’re not the ones

getting this money, then who is,
exactly? " A
Purely by process of elimina-

tion, it’s pretty obvious that the

beneﬁciaries here are the bankers.
After all, who else really works
for the bank besides those soul-
less efﬁgies behind the glass'who
won’t respond to your cries unless
you-have your account number on

October 9, 2008

Bailout plan. passed, but We'restill poor

you? Nobody is who.

This doesn’t seem very fair.
Even if they’re in debt just like the
rest of us, let us not forget that
they work for the bank, which is
where money comes from. I take
ofﬁce supplies from my jobgall the
time —-I’ve never been caught. ’

When we all sit down for
breakfast every morning, we are
surrounded by reminders of our
threatened livelihoods. I ‘ refer
not only to the rising prices of
eggs, bread and donuts, but also
to Wall Street Journal headlines.
What could be more telling, more
comprehensive, more concrete
and more utterly informative than
“Bailout Passes, Economy Slips?”
There’s no escaping these remind-
ers, unless of course you just
choose just to disregard it all. After
all, ignorance is bliss—especially_
if you have to eat it three meals a
day.

Mention the term bluegrass to
most people and you’ll get a few re-
sponses, including “I hate country mu-

Unfortunately, neither response is
quite ﬁtting for the genre that’s' seen
such resurgence in recent years

While bluegrass is traditionally a
music form that evokes thoughts of
the Appalachian mountains and

of its playful use of standup bass, ban-

Choir mixes up fall concert vvitha variety of genres

Heinz Chapel Choir Fall
Concert

Sunday, Oct. 19 at 3 p.m. in Heinz
Chapel
, Free to the public

The Heinz Chapel Choir will
perform a variety of popular" mu-
sic, spirituals, classical pieces and
folk songs and once again delight
audiences on Sunday at their an-
nual fall concert.

The Heinz Chapel Choir has
become a ﬁxture at,Pitt and the
surrounding community. Several
times a year the choir performsin

Heinz Chapel to a full house of‘
i supporters. Clearly, everyone in-

volved takes pride in their roles-

“Choir has been a big part of
my experience at Pitt,” said Heinz
Chapel Choir president Samantha
Meese.

The choir offers an opportu—-

nity to develop good friendships,
take a break from classes and keep
in touch with music, said Meese.

Like other members before
her, Meese said she hopes to con-
tinue to keep music in her life.
She plans to continue’ graduate
school to earn her master’s in mu-
sic education and someday open
a performing arts studio.

As president, Meese enforces ‘

the bonds of camaraderie in her
ceremonial duties that initiate
new choir members during two-

i day retreats in the fall. ‘
The retreats and bi—weekly re-

hearsals allow members to hone
their skills for performances later

in the year, skills which their audi— V

ences greatly appreciate.
“Getting the audience to come
back is the main idea,“ said direc-

ary includes performing in choral
concerts, visiting national monu-
ments and absorbing Chinese
culture. '

“It’s somewhere I’d never

Meese. ’

offerings for multiple genres of

before beheading an adversary. It
features some graphic lyrics: “He
who spits the ﬁre seethes / All

 

he detests / Decapitating, bloody

also carries memorable harmonies

and chorus. The song starts off

solos to make a unique sound all

the catchy chorus and bellowing
grunts, while at times standing on

“The Calamity” is one of the -

few predominantly tenor songs, al-
though most of the focus is on the
swirling riffs that litter this stand
out song.

Halfway into the track lies a daz-

F leetwood Mac lives on in
Buckingham's newest CD

by Larissa Gula
Staﬂ W/rite/'

' life is just downright terrible at the time.

Gift of Screws

Lindsey Buckingham
Warner Bros. Records
Rocks like: Fleetwood Mac

 

The newest relief from
comes in the form of an album that features

a smooth mix of drum and guitarfrom a _

classic rock staple.

Lindsey -Buckingham,
best known for being one
of the creative forces behind
Fleetwood Mac, released his
sixth solo album Gift of
Screws last month.

Buckingham maintains
his welI—khown, old—school style on his new
album, sounding similar to Fleetwood Mac.

 

B In fact, seven songs originally meant for B

Gift of Screws were removed because of

requests to record them with the newest p

Fleetwood ‘Mac group in 2001, which leaves
10 songs for solo—fans to dig into. "i

It’s a comfort to hear the softer and older
sounds  the days of blaring metal and rap,
a reminder that there is a capacity to express
emotion through music. " ‘

' Buckingham ﬁlls his album with emotional
lyrics that he sings with his sometimes raspy
but smooth voice. The music consists mainly
of prettily plucked guitar parts and light
drums.

The first track, “Great Day,” is entirely
about Buckingham sporting a broken—hearted

' woman caught in riverbed currents. The song

ends with Buckingham going from “today
was a great day’ ’ to “it wasn’t such a great
day/’ —— perhaps admitting in the end that his

'. Looking for a song to remember past
relationships? Buckingham’s third traclg “Did
you Miss Me,” is a tribute to high school
relationships come and gone but remembered
dearly. _ 1
,“Love Runs Deeper” has a screaming ,
guitar and proclaims, “Love runs deeper from
a broken home / Black angel can’t be alone /
Love runs deeper from the underground.”
If your hopes are easily crushed, avoid the
sixth track, “Bel Air Rain.” — .
Sadly, the song holds the theme that the
insanity of life eventually causes people to
give up. People who were once ‘,‘i-ighting

Don’t listen to the so—called heavy metal
purists. Metallica’s new album is awesome.
It’s called Deaf/9 Magnetic, none of the
songs are less than ﬁve minutes long, it’s got
some of the sickest guitar riffs in the last
decade, the soloing could make your ﬁngers
bleed, and it is heavy as allhell. "
Sounds like a fnetal classic, right?-W/ell,
as the many Metallica fans who wish it was
still 1986 would say, “Dude, Metallica hasn’t
been good since T/.2e Black Album. And even
that kinda sucked.” — _' _
’ Now _I think it’s time, as a favor for both
Metallica and ourselves, to ﬁnally ‘get this

3 out in the open: No, the band doesn’t sound
‘  exactly like it did when it released its best

album, Matter of Pzgbpetr. And,,no, it prob-
ably never will again. But it’s' time to buck
up and get over it, because the truth is, Me-
tallica still kicks more ass than the majority
of boring, thrashy, screamo bands out there
today -— and Metallica is twice their age. ~
The whole Metallica quandary started
almost 20 years ago. You see, in thegreat
decade during which most of us were born,
the ’80s, most of themusic that came out
really sucked (I’m sorry to all the Flock of".
Seagulls fans out there, but it’s true). High-
est up on the genre awfulness category was
hard rock, most speciﬁcally heavy metal.
4 _\X/hile subgenres of rock like indie/ col-
lege rock  The Smiths) and hard-
core punk (Black Flag, MinoriThreat) were
at their artistic peak, heavy metalwas over-

crowded with dudes looking like ladies, writ— ’
ing boring songs about cherry pie.

Bands like Def Leppard, Poison and
Bon jovi touted themselves as ‘heavy metal,
but let’s be honest ¥—— the only thing metal

about ‘these guys was their jewelry.

Enter the metal underground, in which
bands like Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax kept
the heavy metal of Black Sabbath waving
faster than ever. Of all those bands, Metal~
lica was the only one to break into the main-
stream, musically crushing metal poseur
groups in its wake with riffs that were faster,
drums that were harder and lyrics that were
darker than anything to ever creep through
that hack Brett Michaels’ worst nightmares.

In 1986, Metallica released Matter of Pay)-
petr, which is arguably the best heavy metal
album of all time. Every song is a classic. It’s
fast. Really, really fast. These songs don’t get
stuck in your head — they stomp around
inside your skull wearing steel—toed boots.

The record has sold more than six mil-S
lion copies and made Metallica the biggest

genuine heavy metal band in the world.

Bands like Def Lep—

pard, Poison and Bon
Jovi itouted them’
selves as heavy metal,_
but let’s be honest --

about t ese guys was.
their jewelry. % %

Then 1991 happened, and the ‘genuine
heavy metal’ part of theprevious sentence
disappeared. Metallica was simply the big-

’ gest band in the world. It released T/JeiB/ac/é

A/bum,‘ with its -dark, crushing mega—hit
“Enter Sandman,” and all the kids still lis-
tening to Def Leppard wet themselves and
«stopped pouring sugar on each other.

Bluegrass bands not just for country music fans

Bluegrass, page 11

away at homemade instruments

In fact, bluegrass today is, dare I say
it, cool

And this weekend in Pittsburgh,
two of the biggest contemporary
bluegrass bands around will stop by
Mr. Smalls: Railroad Earth on Saturday
and Yonder Mountain String Band on
Monday.

But don’t worry about getting out
a strawhat and overalls—justwear
something you can dance in because
these bands know how to party.

“There’s some sort of innate spin-
tuality in these songs that make people
comfortable to be in that space to really
let loose,” said Railroad Earth violinist
Tim Carbone.

It’s a feeling that Carbone’s been

nursing for the better  of 30 years,
too, as he’s been playing the fiddle
since the  of the Grateful Dead’s
first records '

“In my grade school, I decided that
I’d take up the violin because there was
agidwholhadacrushondoingthe
same  What better way to get
around her more often than totake

violin lessons,” he said. “It dicln’t work

out, though She was an Air Force brat
and moved away during the summer,
and I got stuck with the ﬁddle”

But getting stuck with the fiddle
wasn’t a bad  at all for Carbone.

Now with Railroad Earth, Carbone

is in one of the most popular, genre-
 bluegrass bands around.
The band’s latest record, Amen

Comer, plays like a late—night farm party
where the whole neighborhoods get-
tingin on the fun. Carbone’s ﬁddle and
electric  trade off, while acoustic
guitar, mandolin‘ and acoustic bass
playﬁﬂly duel in the background

Seethebandlive,though,andthe'

party gets wilder. Railroad Earth is
known best for its intense live shows,
full of huge sections of improvisation
and tdppy instrumentals
“\Whenweplayin frontof acrowd,
I’m tryingto tune out and tune in at the
same time I’m detaching myself from
the real world when I play solo — I’m
transpormd somewhere else,” said

,Carbone. “I’m ﬂoating with the mu-

the quartet extends its traditional blue-
grass songs to form that come in
waves of intensity, causing even the “I
hate country music’ ’ nonbeliever to tap
his foot. Y ,

For YMSB’s bassist Ben Kauf-
mann, the biggest draw of bluegrass
in today’s musical landscape isn’t about
the music at all —— it’s about the com-
munity.

“Our fans are sharing a common‘
A interest; They’re a group of individuals

coming together,  to really feel
what this music means in their hearts
That’s what people get in this scene
And it isn’t found in pop music,” said

Kaufmann

“Where else do such a widespread
grouping of people find the same
openmindedness? It’s probably not
church. It’s definitely not politics It’s
probably not their jobs.  else can ‘- ~_

_ they fit in like this and gather together?

That’s one of the ﬁmdamental human
experiences, and its completely missing
in America today”

Kaufmann’s love for the musical
community that surrounds him isn’t
 (he’s,ina bandat the center

a of it all), but his passion isn’t unfound-

ed. Check out a Yonder Mountain or
a Railroad Earth show,_and you’ll see

\While the album was good —— really, really
good — it was a far cry from the band’s

hard—rocking, almost bluesy tunes, not the

of 1999 was alive album recorded with a
full orchestra (Note: Violas are not metal),
and 2003’s S2‘. Anger was just plain awful.

But now, with Death illagﬂelzk, Metallica
returned to the whirlwind speedy agro—met—
al of its heyday.

And you know what? A whole lot of .

those dudes who walked out, on Metallica in
1996 simply refuse to come back, "citing rea-

 

sons such as “Itsstill not [Matter of Pzgbpets,”
“It’s still not Kill E//1/1//,” or “I don’t listen
to metal anymore. I blew out my eardrums
at a Slayer show in 1994.” , '

To you folks who just don’t want to ac-
cept that Metallica, once again, rocks, I say
this: Bury your preconceived notions and

stop throwing darts at your St. Anger post— a

er. No, the band doesn’t sound exactly like
it did in 1986.

Singer James Hetf1eld’s voice is notice-
ably lower (and thereby, in my opinion, bet-

ter).

Robert ,Trujillo’s bass has a more rub-
bery sound than either Jason Newsted’s or
original bassist Cliff Burton’s, and the lyr-
ics are, if anything, even more focused on
death than ever before. It is, admittedly, not
quite as’ fast as the ’80s.

But if you’ve been waiting since 1991
for a new Metallica album that sounded like
Metallica, you’ve got it in Death Mag/zetic.
Just forget about the ’90s and put your devil
horns up.

football season. A loss to Bowl-

Now, after an upset victory
against No. 10 South Florida, the
Panthers are aware that overcon-
ﬁdence might lead to a defeat

similar to their Bowling Green.

debacle.
Sophomore defensive end Ja-

baal Sheard credited Pitt’s only.

loss of the season to its attitude
entering the game.

“Bowling Green was like a l

wakeup call,” said Sheard. “We
were too cocky.”

Sheard continued by say-

ing that the South Florida game .

might lead to the same attitude if
the Panthers .don’t stay modest.
Pitt will have an extended pe-
riod of time to consider its ﬁrst
place position in the Big East and
its return to the Associated Press

won’t "travel to Navy until Oct.

The Mitsch Report

Get over it: Manny

  

by Pat Mitsch
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Everyone needs to_let go of
the whole Manny thing. A

Manny Ramirez is the wacky
and polarizing outﬁelder respon-
sible for the majority of base
ball’s stretch—run and post—season
drama since the Boston Red Sox
traded him ‘to the Los Angeles
Dodgers on July 31. i 

Manny is one of _history’s
most proliﬁc hitters and repeat-
edly put up monster numbers
with Boston since 2001, but he

I certainly wore out his welcome

there over the last several years.
He’s been accused of not playing

hard (not playing, even), arguing

with teammates, not respecting

, the gameand just general disrup-

tion and delinquency in the Red
Sox locker room, all of which has
seemed to be Valid.

And now, because Manny. is
raking again after a fresh start in
L.A., it’s apparently remarkable?

-“It’s extraordinary,” said Tim.
McCarver, the Fox broadcaster
who will call the World Series, to
the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Is it? Manny’s numbers are
better since joining the Dodgers —
.397 batting average, .489 on—base
percentage, 17 home runs and 53

_ RBIs, as opposed to hitting .347

with a .473 OBP in his last month
with Boston — but so were Ter-

Cowboys after his conflict with
the Eagles. So were Randy Moss’
when he joined the Patriots from
the Raiders.

“[In] every sport, there have

been people who have held orga;

nizations hostage, whether it be

Terrell Owens or Randy Moss or -
Manny Ramirez,” added McCa~ 7'

rver in the Inquirer.
Exactly. There are eccentric
and controversial personalities in

every sport with money—hungry’

agents in their ears, and they’re
not going to bow to management,
even to a sacred organization like
the Red Sox. They’re going to
want theirs, and they deserve it.
