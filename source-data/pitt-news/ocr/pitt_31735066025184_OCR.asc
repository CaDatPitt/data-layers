Faculty Assembly calls for investigation

By Heather Gahres’
Staff Writer - .

Yesterday the Faculty
Assembly questioned the
legitimacy of the newly creat-
ed position of senior vice
chancellor of Health
Administration, cur_rently held
by Jeffrey Romoff.

“[Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor] suggested that the
appointment was merely a
reorganization, which is
something I found hard to

understand, since this
involved two offices, and it
involved the vice president of
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center being moved
to president,” Senate Council
President James Holland said.

Faculty Assembly members
approved an amendment to
appoint an adhoc committee
to investigate the creation of
the new vice charfcellor posi-
tion and the method of filling
the position without undergo-
ing a search committee.

Autopsy reveals little,
Presby officials say

By Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor

Following an autopsy of the
first-ever baboon-to—human
liver transplant recipient, doc-
tors are still not sure of the
cause of the sudden cerebral
hemorrhage that killed the 55-
year-old man, according to
Pitt’s Associate Professor of
Surgery, and Division of
Transplantation Chief John
Fung.

The preliminary results of the
autopsy were announced at a
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center press conference on
Tuesday.

“We weren’t_able to identify
the source of. bleeding,”
Associate Professor of
Pathology Anthony J. Demetris
said.

Demetris said that is not
uncommon with‘ preliminary
autopsy results and more
detailed microscopic evalua-
tions are forthcoming.

The patient’s liver however,
was in very good condition
according to Professor of
Surgery, and Transplantation
Institute Director Thomas E.
Starzl.

“The state of that liver after

’ more than 70 days was really

remarkably good, almost nor-
mal,” Starzl said.

“The liver was not [in a seri-
ously deteriorated conditionl as
has been typical with all the
xenografts done to date,”
Demetris said. _

Starzl said results of this

xenotransplant were the best

yet.
“At the time of their removal,
[previous xenotransplant '

organs] were utterly ruined 
they had gangrene in portions
of the organ. None of that was
found here,” Starzl said.

Starzl said it was possible
another baboon liver may be
transplanted into a human by
the end of this year.

“On the surface, it looks to
me as" if there is a very real
possibility, having completed
these analyses, that there
should be another trial,” Starzl
said.

Starzl said the results are so
promising, he said less treat-
ment maybe used next time.

“This patient was treated
beyond normal, had more 
procedures  than normal. I
think that would be reduced
the next time around.”

Starzl said the understandable
fear of rejection also caused
therapy to be pushed to the
limit, and the next time around
would be avoided.

“The nature of the rejection
was not grave, and it respond-
ed quickly to augmented
steroid therapy, something very
simple,” Starzl said.

“If this were to be done
again, there are some small
things that I would do different,
that I think would make a
major difference,” Starzl said.

Primarily, Starzl said he
would put a tube into the liver
to allow liver tests without sur-

Jeffrey Romoff was appoint-
ed to be both the president
of the UPMC and the senior
vice chancellor of Health
Administration, -after the
announcement of the retire-
ment of Thomas Detre.

Former Senate Council
President Richard Tobias said
the administration had
appointed a faculty member
without having a Search com-
mittee once before.

However the administration
had consulted ‘the Senate”

Look Out Below!

Council, Tobias said.

“There was no consultation
on this matter,” Tobias said.

The standard operating
procedures for appointing a
president or vice chancellor
is to go through a search
committee comprised of five
elected faculty, Holland said.

This procedure was passed
by the Senate Council in
1985, and has been imple-
mented as a standard part of
procedures, Holland said.

Shakespeare Festival cancels last performance

By Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

Due to a lack of funds, Pericles, the
Three
Shakespeare'Festival, has been can-

final play of the

celled.

“The. Festival is looking at a deficit
because of an unforeseeable chain of
events. Number one is the newspaper
strike. Number two is the recession, and

number three is a lack of funding from
major corporations and foundations,”
Producing Director of the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival.Attilio Favorini said.

When it became clear the newspaper
strike was not going to end soon, it was
decided one of the chief ways to con-
serve the budget would be to cancel

Favorini went on to explain that the

Bus strike continues
for workers on job

By Jason Hillman
Editor in Chief V \

During Monday’s Labor Day parade, the newspaper
‘ . strike took center stage. Yet that strike is not the
longest current strike in Pittsburgh.

The members of Amalgamated Transit Union Local
85, the bus drivers for Port Authority Transit, have
been on strike since March 16, for 178 days.

However, the drivers were forced to return to
work by Commonwealth Court Judge Silvestri on April
11.

PAT and ATU Local 85 are still in the process of
negotiating for a new contract. The union has been
without a contract since Nov. 30 of last year.

.“Judge Silvestri has got our hands tied. We can’t have

. a contract. We negotiate daily and nothing’s being
done,” A member of Local 85 Joe Bartlett said.

“We’re basically still on strike, but we’re being put
back by a court order. Maybe someone can get can to
Judge Silvestri, and let the people of Allegheny County
know that we’re still hard workers and we need a con-
tract. We don’t have one to date.” -

Both PAT and ATU Local 85 could not comment on
the situation due to a court order restraining anyone
involved from speaking about the negotiations.

Striving to improve conditions
for women on Pitt’s campus, the
Campus Women’s Organization
met for the first time this semes-
ter to discuss future plans.

Everything from campus safe-
ty to abortion rights to Lynn
Yeakel’s campaign was dis-
cussed as projects for the
upcoming idea.

Bringing a women’s center to
Pitt was also mentioned as a
necessity on campus.

Co-President of CWO, Jenna
Ferrara, encouraged the forma-
tion of smaller, special interest
groups within the organ-
ization to handle each issue dis-
cussed.

Ferrara also said that although
the CWO is firmly a feminist,
pro—choice organization, a
woman does not have to be
pro—choice to be in the group.
“If you are undecided about the
issue of choice, but you’re still
concerned about the issues of

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 9,1992

C W0 plans for future

campus safety, about Lynn
Yeakel, please get involved.”

Other groups, such as
BiGALA and Young Democrats,
voiced their support as well as
encouraged those present to
attend their organization’s meet-
ings.

Many f1rst—year women came
out of curiosity “just to see what
it’s all about.”

One female student voiced
her grievance about a female,
feminist professor in Pitt’s law
department who was denied
tenure by the Provost.

She suggested that CWO write
a letter in protest. Close to 100
men and women attended.

A panel of Pitt administrators
and student group leaders will
discuss the issue of cultural
diversity on campus at the next
CWO meeting Sept. 17 from 7-9
p.m in the Union.

CWO said they encourage any
women who have concerns
about their safety or their treat-
ment on campus to voice thier
opinions at the meetings.

In addition to intimidating unemploy-
ment rates, today’s job market poses
many challenges to the college graduate,
according to Placement Information
Specialist James R. Holcomb.

“There is a tendency for a student to
self-assess his job—specific skills, but dis-
regard his personal preferences when
choosing a career.

"It is important to match people with
jobs in terms of their underlying values
as well as their job specific skills,”
Holcomb said at a placement seminar
held last evening.

When choosing a career, one must
also consider the widespread problem of
dissatisfaction ,in the work place,

Holcomb said.He stressed the impor—'

tance of taking one’s values and interests
into account when choosing a career.

job market survival war/esbops beldfor CGS students

“In fact, one may have all of the skills
on Earth to do a specific job, but if the
job conflicts with his underlying values,
he may become dissatisfied and disinter-
ested in his quality of work.”

Holcomb pointed out the job charac-
teristics 'which are best suited to a cer-
tain individual. ’

He emphasized the wealth of
resources‘ at the University of Pittsburgh
open to College of General Studies stu-
dents as well as the rest of the student
body, especially the University
Placement Service and the Career
Division of the University Counseling
Service.

“Hands-on” encounters within one’s
chosen field while in college are invalu-
able, Holcomb said. Experience such as
an internship or even observing a job for

a dayvcan prove a worthy source of

information.
“A considerable amount of the popula-

i

tion is dissatisfied with their job.

One of the biggest causes of this is
personal unhappiness due to unex-
pected aspects of their job,” Holcomb
said.“Pitt offers excellent information
and services to prepare graduates for
their field.”

Holcomb said that in order to prepare
students for future scenarios, the
University of Pittsburgh offers placement
seminars to students in the CGS.

He conducts the seminars each week
to discuss topics ranging from personal
preferences in a job to technical aspects
such as Writing resumes. ,

According to Holcomb, the six-week
series of seminars “offer to help CGS
students help themselves.”

Upcoming seminars will include fur-
ther discussions on the career develop-
ment process. Students of CGS may reg-
ister at no charge in Room 452 Cathedral

“The Board of Trustees used this
version of the policy when hiring
Chancellor O’Connor. -

"The policy therefore has been

implicitly and has been recognized,”
Holland said.

In August, over 1300 faculty
responded to advisory ballots
on. whether there should be a

said.

“Eighty-four percentxof the ballots

Holland said.

Harry for President

This man was the 55rd President of the United States
of America. He was involved in the establishment of
the United Nations and basically just wanted to give
everybody a Fair Deal. ‘

Will the real Harry S. Truman please stand up? All
over the. country, sightings ‘of Elvis Presley and Harry
S. Truman are commonplace. The former we know

A about, but what is it with Harry Truman? Once again

good old “give ‘em hell” Harry has burst on to the
political scene — only this time it’s in the revitalization
of the popular 1970’s game show To  .
The recent image of Bill Clinton and George Bush
jumping up and yelling “I’m Harry Truman!” provokes

—a kind of perverted nostalgia that can only make peo-

ple nauseous. .
But of course it’s just that Bush and Clinton are jock-

. eying for the lead on the oh-so-very—important issue ——

_which one of them best embodies the characteristics of
Truman? S _

We would much rather have them talk to us about
that, rather than stupid issues like foreign policy, the
environment or the economy. Those issues pale in
comparison. The next obvious question then is who

. will best emulate the ideas of Lincoln and/or

Washington? Will it be Bush who first dons the wood-
en teeth and Clinton the stove top hat, or vice versa?

The persona of Truman was that of the anti—politi—
cian. He was both a working man’s president and
earned an image of a man who liked to tell the truth.
In a time when most politicians are despised, it is no
surprise that bothcandidates are involved in a meta-
physical tug—of—war to grab Truman’s image. But most
importantly, when the chips were down, Truman the
underdog, in what was thought to be an unwinnable
election against republican nominee Thomas S.
Dewey, won.

It is hard to imagine the lanky Bush or the dapper

Clinton as a twin for the diminutive, bespectacled
Truman. O S

' But George “Harry” Bush, the incumbent, is now try-
ing to picture himself as Truman’s long lost soul mate
—. an honest, frustrated underdog. Likewise, Bill f‘Give
‘em Hell”gClinton is trying to paint himself as a
Trumanesque populist. But what is so ironic about this
whole thing is the context in which it has been per-

‘ formed. Neither, Bush nor Clinton has identified with

any of the policies of the dead president. Rather, they
have focused on this vague notion of Truman as an
image; an image of, as Clinton put it, “the working
peoples’ president.” If the bestthat either candidate
can do is fight over the personality of a dead presi-
dent, then we all might as well vote for Truman him-
self.

“Are you going to graduate
this year?” asked my: friend.

“Of course not,” I replied
angrily. ~ _.

“But isn’t it your fourth year
of school?” he asks.

“So what!”

“Well, uh, your supposed to
graduate in four years, aren’t
you?”

-For some reason I keep hav-
ing this conversation with peo- ‘
ple. I have come to realize that
it is my job to spread the word
and educate the poor, ill-
informed masses — the ones (a
large percentage of whom are
parents) who are under this
horrid misconception that a
college education is supposed
to last no more than four years.

Let me ask you a question.
Why did we come to the
University of Pittsburgh? The
answer is obvious. We are here
for an education —— a chance to
learn and to better ourselves.
That way we can be productive
members of the work force and

_society (take for example those

waiters and waitresses, also
known as English literature
majors, who bring us our food
at restaurants). A

We cannot be bogged down
with misconceptions and false
stereotypes. That is why I
refuse to be handcuffed by that
stupid, idiotic, bourgeoise train
of thought that you must grad-

  Education is about ta/emg your time

uate in four years. I mean look
at yourself in the mirror and
ask yourself, “Am I here for an
education or for a race?” V
If you examine a good edu-

' cation you will find that it con-

sists of a worldly education,
thorough knowledge of the
past, knowledge of the present,
and I’ll even throw in good

arithmetic skills (like you are
ever- going to use them again).
But will someone please
explain to me where speed fits
in.

School is not the track team.
We must learn to prioritize and
not get sucked into this way of
thought. So relax, take your
time, and get the most out of
your classes. For instance, feel
free to withdraw from any
course if you do not feel that
it is going well. If you have
a busy schedule, do what I do
— fail the course and take it
over at your earliest conve-
nience. ’

Now for those students who
feel that this attitude is not con-
ducive for maintaining a good
relationship with your parents,
you need only to_follow a few
simple rules: be tough, firm
and in charge with them. _Do

not be swayed by minor tech-
nicalities that they bring up,
like who is paying the tuition
bill. Just let them know that it
is your life, your education and
that you are going to do as you
please. Then hang up on them.
Believe me, they will get the
message. And most importantly
you will have earned their trust
and respect.

I have one final piece of
advice, on how not to graduate
on time. Do not fall into the
requirement trap. Apparently,
before you can register, they
have Pitt graduates, who could
not get jobs making french fries
at McDonald’s, “advising” you
and guiding your educational
pursuits. They will attempt to

have you take the required .

courses to ensure that you can
cross that finish line in time.

3-.

Well, simply but nicely tell 9,.

them to “go work at the O
where you belong, peeling
potatoes and mopping up.”
Your conviction will reinforce
the respect that they have for
you taking college as seriously
as you do.

Now that the add/drop peri-
od will soon be over you can
immediately apply my sugges-

tions. Just go to Thackeray Hall

and show them who is boss. If
anyone questions your deci-
sions simply laugh and tell
them “I hear that track practice
starts next Thursday.”

Police shouldn't ticket moving students

Everyone is aware of how
difficult it is to find parking
in Oakland, especially in
close proximity to the
University. The difficulty is
especially compounded ‘dur-
ing the first several days of
the new college year with the
influx of ‘parents moving their
sons and daughters into the
dorms. Parking, if you are
lucky to find such a place, is
usually sheer luck of the
drive by.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 9, 1992

A first-year student's
first thoughts of Pitt

The ‘paranoia started on the
four—and-a-half—hour car ride to
Pitt.- That is when the two parts
of my mind started to work: the
sane and”not-so-sane parts.
Because I am a first-year stu-

so-sane part of my mind had
convinced the sane part that I
was going to be_ a miserable
failure, I was going to hate Pitt
and I would also come home
after the first week of school. I

dent I began to
think about all
of the new peo-
ple and new
experiences I

Rachel
Haynes

had decided ,all'
of this before I
had even
hauled the first
load of my stuff

was going to have. Then I start-
ed to think about the things
that could go wrong. The word
failure immediately surfaced in
my overactive imagination. But
I wasn’t thinking about little
failures, instead I was looking
at the big picture — failure on
an enormous level.

Throughout high school I
had been able to get good
grades and do minimal
amounts of work in my classes
— in other words I slid by. The
sane part of my brain started
telling me that college is much
different. Pitt is supposed to
prepare me for the rest of my
life, which means that if I am
going to have a good life and
make some money, I should
pay attention in class. But can I
handle the work and all of the
stress? Or during ﬁnals will I try
to jump out of my dorm-room
window that only opens about
four inches?

Going to class and studying
is only one component of col-

lege life, the other part of it is‘

the social aspect. College, for
many, means leaving all of
your friends behind and mak-
ing new ones. Okay, I said I’m
not the most outgoing person
but I have friends at home, and
I am sure that I’ll find new
friends atschool. Won’t 1? Or
will I be a social misfit who
only comes out of her dorm
room to eat,” and go to the
library? I was petrified by the
time my parents and I were dri-
ving on Fifth Avenue and head-
ing towards my dorm. The not-

into my room.

I’ve calmed down since I
arrived at Pitt for. I’ve made a
few friends, spent minimal
amounts of time in my dorm
room a_nd after buying my
books I’ve resigned myself to
actually studying this year. My
not-—so-sane mind has quieted
down and I realize that I am
not the only person with the
same fears. We, the first-year
students, are all clueless, and
that is our uniting force. It’s
what helps us to bond, make
friends and try to get over
being homesick. I could always
spot a first-year student at ori-
entation by the fluorescent-
orange wristbands that were
given to us to wear. Although
they were embarrassing and

_ annoying, they let myself and

other freshman know that there
was a person just as clueless as
we were.

Despite the fear of failure,
there is something exciting,
about the newness of things,
people and places. For first-
year studentsit is now time
that we can finally be adults
and start making our own deci-
sions. College gives us the
opportunity to look at the
entire world through a different
perspective, gain knowledge
and of course drink a lot of
beer. Granted, those aren’t
comforting thoughts at two
o’clock in the morning when
the ‘fears start to creep up on
us, but it does help us to look
at the bigger picture —- the one
that doesn’t include failure.

and—shut matter.

and a much shorter wait for the elevators
in the dorms.

After four trips from our vehicle and
back to the dorm, I was angered, to say the
least, finding that I, along with other par-
ents, had received a citation from the City
of Pittsburgh for illegal parking. I do not
deny where I was parked, but where are
you to park?

Perhaps the powers that be, if there are
any at Pitt, could think to provide incoming
dorm students upon arrival, placards for
their vehicles notating they are moving into
the dorms. Do you think the city police
wouldhonor these placards?

Additionally, after contacting the officer
who had written the citation, I was told by
the officer, “a call was issued from the
University Hospital to tag the vehicles that
were parked in that area.”

Maybe now I should say Shame, S_hame,
Shame, to the University! Tuition and dorm
costs are high enough without having to
pay a 34 dollar parking fine just to move
in.

Healthy living includes good habits
At the beginning of each year, students

_are reassured that their health requirements

will be adequately met. Despite the super
technology and elite bedside manner of
health professionals, I have fears that some
basics are being overlooked.

What is euphemistically called “health
care” in the U.S. consists mostly of expen-
sive hospitalization and drug therapies.
Sick people are being ‘made more depen-

\ dent then ever on palliative measures,

instead of being taught good living habits.

With regard to tobacco smoking, I hope ’

that the University’s regulations will be
complied with, and non-smoking students
and staff will be able to enjoy freedom
from the nauseating products of tobacco
Combustion.

It is now common knowledge that tobac-
co smoking is a major contributing factor in
the cause of lung cancer, emphysema etc.
How can anyone not know this? Knowing
this, why do we continue to smoke?
Knowing this, why do physicians continue
to smoke?

In one University building there was a
room where hospital workers got together
to smoke. This room was always crowded.
It is not unusual for me to see, as I walk
past, hospital employees with a stetho-
scope in one hand and a cigarette in the
other.

If we are really interested in health, and
not merely disease treatment, we should
set an example to the young people who
enter the prestigious university.

Keep government out of health care

In his September 3 Column, Brett Gilman
argues for national health care. To me this
would be going in the wrong direction.
Instead what we need is to cut government
involvement in health care. _

In 1960, we spent only five percent of
GNP,on health care. But (hiring the 605,
medicare and medicaid were introduced.
With government paying more and more of
the bills, there was less incentive to keep
costs down. Today, we spend 12 percent of
GNP on health care.

All across the country, state regulations
require insurance policies to cover certain
types of care, such as chiropractic care in
some states. These laws increase the price
of health insurance.rThis makes it too
expensive for millions of Americans to pur-
chase coverage.

Insurance companies would love to offer
basic, low cost‘ policies for the millions of
uninsured Americans. But at present, such
policies are illegal. FDA approval of drugs
and other medical treatments can take a
decade" or longer, greatly increasing their
cost.

The primary purpose of the. FDA is not to
protect patients. Instead, its main purpose
is to protect the providers of a medical care
form that would otherwise be higher quali-
ty, lower cost competition. Left to its own
devices, the private sector will continually
deliver newer, better, safer and cheaper
medical care. If only the government
would get out of the way.

tressingly feeble.”

Jr. died? ,

If the honorable and honored civil
rights leader were still alive today, he
would be horrified by the actions of
minorities in America. After the
announcement of the verdict in the
Rodney King trial, Los Angeles erupted.
The violence and destruction that

ensued over one King bankrupted and ._

betrayed the life purpose of the other.
Martin Luther King had serious prob-
lems with race relations in the United
States. He wanted minorities to have the
same rights and privileges as everyone
else. King espoused the beliefs and

teachings of the great Indian leader, .

Mahatma Gandhi. King wanted
oppressed people to engage in passive
resistance to the treatment they received
from white people. King supported
strikes and marches and other acts of
civildisobedience to make the desired

points. He chose thoughtful ways of

fighting the system.
3~ in the Rodney King case, it was the
criminal justice system that drew the ire
of the people in the streets. As far as
most people were concerned, the
videotaped /beating of King. made the
case __against_ the policeofﬂcers an open-

 

Of course, this is not how the United
States’ criminal justice system works.
We have built a structure and estab-
lished guidelines for the handling of
criminal cases. If justice couldbe dis-
pensed without trials, judges or juries,

things could be a whole lot simpler. We

Ed
Kichline

   

choose a different way.

As police officers in our society, quali-
fied men and women are given the
capacity to apprehend suspects. If some
degree of force is required, they [ the
police officers] are supposed to operate
within reasonable guidelines.

The 12 jurors in the case had to decide
if the officers remained within those
boundaries. They heard arguments from
the prosecution and the defense. They
heard testimony‘ from the offenders and
witnesses. The jury was guided through
a ‘meticulous, frame-by-frame account of

the incident. They were instructed by _

the judge of the conditions under which
the officers would be guilty of using
exces_si_.V.€;--

X .

    

The jury acquitted the officers.

In the name of Rodney King, an ex-
criminal, the streets of Los Angeles gave
way to a gross display of rage and a lot
of reckless, murderous opportunism.

What" would Martin Luther King have
wanted? “We will not resort to violence.
We will not degrade ourselves with
hatred. Love will be returned for hate,”
as King said. The man who proclaimed
“I have a dream,” in one of the greatest
speeches Washington D.C. has ever
seen or heard would be ashamed of the
lawlessness.

Newsweele published a tentative list of
54 deaths as a result of the riots, with
the Vast majority being black. He would
not support such suicide for any cause.

Unfortunately, it looks like the work
and dedication of Dr. King is fading.
Black leaders trying to carry the torch of
King “ . . are not always in touch with,
much less in control of, all their sup-
posed followers. In Los Angeles, even
to some usually moderate blacks,
appeals from leaders to channel their
anger into such constructive measures
as voting in a June 2 referendum for an
amendment that would ‘reform police

Instead of.King’s dream of all people
living together peacefully, people are
moving to the militant ideas of Malcolm
X and achieving desired goals “by all
means necessary.” The riots are more
out of the cloth of his teaching than
anything King would want. Both men
were leaders, and both died needlessly,
but their approaches were quite differ-
ent.

Spike Lee’s movie about Malcolm X
will be released in a few months. Lee
recently encouraged students‘ to skip
out of school to go and see his movie. I
am sure the movie will be excellent, but
an intelligent man like Spike Lee should
know better than to tell young people
to shirk" their education. It is education
that gives all people power. If the
equality dreams of King are to be real-
ized, education will be the key.

If minorities continue to seek vindica-
tion in\the United States through vio-
lence, Martin Luther King, Jr. will

become irrelevant. It would be shameful

to see so great a man defiled by the
very people he sought to help.

Two sop/as
compete
to bade
Van Pelt

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Staff Writer

One of the most hotly
contested battles on the
Pa‘nther football squad, to
this point in the season, has
been the competition for the
backup quarterback spot.

The Alex-Van-Pelt-as-
starter era will last just one
more season, but do not
expect head coach Paul
Hackett to push the panic
button after this year. There
is good reason to expect a
smooth transition to the
post-Van-Pelt era in 1995.
Actually, there are two good
reasons: sophomore quarter-
backs _Ken Ferguson and
John Ryan.

Ferguson and Ryan are
both being groomed to lead
the offense next season. In
Pitt’s 51-10 rout of Kent
State, Ryan saw limited
action in the game’s latter
stages. Hackett appears gen-
uinely thrilled with the‘
progress both his young
quarterbacks have made
and probably will not settle
on a number-two man until
absolutely necessary.

“That’s gonna be a tough
call,” Hackett said. “There’s
a small advantage to Ryan
in that he did not play last
year, so he’s not a redshirt
candidate. But that is wide
open.” ,

Hackett said there is a
small chance that Ferguson
couldbe redshirted this sea-
son, but that right now he
wants both quarterbacks to
concentrate on refining the
mental part of their games.

“Alex is so much further
ahead than where they are,
but at this point they are
right where I thought they
would be. I’m very pleased
so far.”

Just their luck.

Head coach Paul Hackett,
considered a master" of the
passing game, announces that
he will key on the run this
season, just as senior wide

Big East
dominance

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
has won seven of the 10 Big
East volleyball championships
played since the conference
began holding a postseason
tournament.

Now the Panthers are going
for their fifth straight title, but
they will do it without six
seniors who graduated, includ-
ing four starters.

Pitt Coach Sue Woodstra,
whose teams have not lost a

took over in 1989, said the
team may actually lose a match
in conference play this time
around.

Pitt was the pick to win it all
again in the 1992 Big Eastvol—
leyball preseason coaches’ poll.
The following is a look at each
Big East team in order of their
place in the coaches’ poll.
University of Pittsburgh — In
addition to its conference rank-
ing, the Panthers entered the
season ranked 25th in the
nation in the American
Volleyball Coaches
Association’s preseason poll.
This team is still not locked to
win the conference champi-
onship with the graduation of
its seniors. The loss of top
recruit Jennie Driscoll will not
help either.

The Panthers are still the
class of the conference. One of
the two returning starters, 1991
Big East Player of the Year,
Ann Marie Lucanie, is a strong
candidate for All—American sta-
tus.

The other is setter Annemarie
Memagh, who is coming off a
strong first year. Even without
Driscoll, Pitt has an outstanding
group of first-year players
who should be able to fill in
the holes and keep the
Panthers on top of the confer-

Actually, it is lucky for them,
because although keying on
the run means fewer passing
attempts, _it also translates into
more man—to-man coverage. If

> Bills still ‘buffalo’ competition in AFC East

By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

The last time an American Football

T Conference East team held the Vince

Lombardi Trophy was 1974, when Bob
Griese, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance

Kid and the No—Name Defense finished

off the only perfect season in modern

9  National Football League history, defeat-

ing the Redskins 14-7 for a second

straight Super Bowl championship.
Since then, an inundation of pre-

tenders — as well as a few legit con-

»..\.«...A..>r-.,

tenders — have held court as hard-luck
Eastern division supremes’, including
Chuck Knox and the Electric Company,
Richard Todd and the Sack Exchange
and “Thermal” Thomas and the
Bickering Bills.

The latter of this auspicious bunch,
Marv Levy’s Buffalo Bills,. are pro foot-
ball’s answer to the National Basketball
Association Portland Trail Blazers —
only 10 times the arrogance and ego
trips. Both have the horses to run with
anyone, but lack in direction and intesti-

nal fortitude to take it to the summit of

5,--.~-~ *".-,..~...-..-...._...._.

their respective sports.

Buffalo’s favorite sons have been the
talented but spoiled child of the East for
years now selfishly running
roughshod over the weaklings of the
AFC with the always explosive combo
of unmatched talent and uncontrolled
personalities. Yet some feel the Bills
time has come and gone; that the
heartache and lifetime serving of hum-
ble pie served to them in the past 24
months has all but rendered this unit
stale and ready to crumble.

Forget that. .

Despite the pain of failures past and
the loss of offensive wizard Ted
Marchibroda to Indianapolis, the final
standings of the ‘92 Eastern division will

.still see Buffalo occupying the catbirds’

seat

Regardless of the fact that the Bills
have their attention directed towards
somethingbigger than besting the
Miamis and‘New Yorks of the East —
namely a date with destiny in Pasadena
late January —— they will still have little
difficulty in capturing their fifth straight

Last year was labeled as “the
season of adversity” for the
Penguins. Adversity seems to
have become synonymous with

 Penguin, because this year

should be more of the same.
Training camp starts Friday
and the Pens are still without a
head coach. Scotty Bowman
has moved back into his role as
director of player development
after he and General Manager
Craig Patrick failed to come to
terms on a new contract. The
leading and apparently only
candidate for the coaching job
is former Penguin Coach and
General Manager Eddie

3 Johnston. While Johnston was

here, he laid the foundation for
the current Stanley Cup champs
by drafting Mario Lemieux, Bob
Errey, Paul Stanton, Jim Paek
and Shawn McEachern. ‘_

There are both positives
and negatives to hiring
Johnston. On the positive side,
he and Lemieux are good
friends. We all know what
can happen to a coach when
the “Big Guy” doesn’t like him
(Where have you gone Gene
Ubriaco?). —

Johnston also seems to have
his heart set in Pittsburgh,
something he displayed while
he was G.M. in Hartford. After
the Pens won their first cup,

Johnston gloated about how he

built the team, and how his
teams could have won if it
were not for that damn Tony
Esposito (ex-Pen general inan-
ager who replaced Johnston)

and his role in blocking a trade

that would have brought star

goalie Andy Moog to Pittsburgh Jennings here in March of 1991,

in the spring of 1988.

During his tenure as head
coach for Pittsburgh from 1980
to 1983, Johnston almost

_ guided the team to an upset

playoff victory in 1982 against
the dynasty Islanders of the
early ‘80s. His overall record
with the Pens was 79-12665,

Jim Clark

not bad considering how bad
those teams of a decade ago
were.

On the negative side,
Pittsburgh is Hartford South
with ex-Whalers Ron Francis,
Ulf Samuelsson, Grant Jennings
and Dave Tippett. After dealing
Francis, Samuelsson and

Johnston openly criticized

TI-IE PIIT NEWS, Wednesday, September 9, 1992

Francis about his lack of lead-
ership. That was a point raised
by Johnston earlier that season
when Francis was stripped of
his status as team captain.
Johnston also criticized
Samuelsson and Jennings while
they were still in Hartford and
after the trade was made. One
must wonder how key contrib-
utors Francis and Samuelsson

will react to having Johnston as _

coach.

The head coaching position
is not the only vacant coaching
position for the Pens, though.
Assistant coach Pierre McGuire
has gone to be an assistant
with Hartford (surprise, sur-
prise!) while assistant coach
Barry Smith has taken a job
with Knoxville of the East ‘
Coast Hockey League. Their
departures leave Rick Kehoe

Pens still without a coach as training camp approaches

On the player front, the Pens
have lost seven members of the

two more players remain in

tory, only Randy Gilhen was
lost.’

First of all, two players have

season. He is exception-
ally mobile and excels at
throwing on the run.
New quarterback coach

,Chris Petersen describes
Ferguson as “more of the
athletic type of quarter-
back.” -

At 6’-3”, 195 pounds,
Ryan is the classic drop-
back passer with a pow-
erful arm. He had an
impressive spring prac-
tice and has a shot to win
the number—two spot.

Both gained valuable
repetitions during spring
practice while Van Pelt
rested his ailing elbow.
Neither has gained much
of an edge in experience.
As the number—two quar-
terback l_ast season,
Ferguson attempted only
two passes.

Both young prospects
have made good impres-
sions on Petersen with
their work habits.

“They are completely
and totally detail orient-
ed,” Petersen said. “When
you get guys that are that
self-motivated, it makes
things fun.”

In Petersen’s eyes this
is the ideal situation. Van
Pelt is leading the way
for the two young quar-
terbacks, who are at the
same -time constantly
pushing each other. He
said that they have
brought out the best in
each other so far.

“Both of them push
each other, and I think if
one of them wasn’t here
it would hurt the other
guy because they
wouldn’t be raising the
level for each other,”
Petersen said.

division crown. They still have
the studs. It is as simple as that.

With a red-hot offense that
fires to the call of quarterback
Jim Kelly, mega—back Thurman
Thomas and the gracefully
aging James Loften and Andre
Reed, hot—wing maniacs. will
only have their spicy pregame
food to blame for the antacid
parties following Bills games.
And with the super acquisition
of placekicker Steve Christie (a
plan B acquisition from Tampa
Bay), the rich get richer, adding
another scoop to the super
sundae known as the Buffalo
offense.

On defense, linebacker
Cornelius Bennett continues to
be the productive heart of the
Bills. The key to whether they
can take that extra step and
win the Super Bowl lies in the
recovery of defensive end
Bruce Smith’s ailing knee. If
week one is any indication,

Smith looks to be more than _

just talk —— leaping blockers

and working the defensive line »

like he said he would the past
two seasons. If this glorious

disease of speaking with your
actions would only infect
the entire Buffalo roster,
upstate New Yorkers would
finally get the victory celebra-
tion they both expect and
deserve.

The true race in the East is
the bridesmaid position, where
the Miami Dolphins figure to
migrate permanently by mid-
December. Don Shula’s team
usually begins with robo-quar-
terback Dan Marino and the air
attack of Mark’s ‘Clayton and
Duper. But the key to‘ a suc-
cessful ‘92 in the land of lazy
fans dressed as empty seats
comes in the newcomer firm of
Vincent, Coleman and
Humphreys. _

The ‘Phins are always dis-
missed as pretenders solely on
the fact that their defense has
been about as consistent and
reliable as their running game.
Well, both question marks got
big answers  at least eventual
answers  with slick offseason
acquistions of draft picks Troy

gruntled Sammie Smith.

The draft picks should do
wonders to the Miami pass
defense, which has long been
the weakness of the defensive
unit. Coleman, a monster stand-
up pass rusher from Georgia
Tech, had a super preseason
and should elevate his game to
an All-Pro level by the seasons’
end. Cornerback Vincent, _an
All-American at Wisconsin, may
take longer to develop, but
should be an outstanding DB
for the next decade.

Humphries is more of an iffy
situation. After sitting out most
of ‘91 with a contract dispute,
the former Denver Bronco may
be rusty early on. The fact that
Miami is a predominantly pass-
oriented unit should take the
pressure off the former All-Pro,
who will find his niche by mid-
October.

With an improving defense
and Mr. Marino tossing 24-30
points on the board every
week, this Dolphin unit is
headed for postseason play.

The word in the land of the
New York Jets is actually two
words: Browning Nagle. Ever

since the Rangers ate the Civic
Arena ice last May, New York
sports fans have spent their
time all but anointing the sec-
ond-year quarterbacklfrom
Louisville the second coming of
Joe Namath. And with good
reason. '9 ‘

Nagle has the moxie, the
cannon arm and verve to han-
dle the throne of big man in
the big city. Despite these virtu-
al realities, it can’t and won’t
happen overnight. Sure, he
looked brilliant in his ‘92 debut
at the Georgia Dome — going
21 of 27, passing for 366 yards
and two touchdowns. He’s got
the go—to guys in Rob Moore,
Al Toon and Rob Carpenter.
But that was Atlanta  with a
depleted secondary minus
Deion Sanders and Brian
Jordan. Wait ‘til he meets Mr.
Bennett and Mr. Smith in blus-
tery Buffalo."

In the Jets’ backfield, the '

drum roll is sounding in des-
perate anticipation of the real
Blair Thomas. If this guy stays
away from injury or that god-
awful apathy bug, he may be

tion to those two, center Jock
Callander left to join the expan-
sion Tampa Bay Lightning.

Joining Callander in Tampa
Bay is goalie Wendell Young
and defenseinan Peter
Taglianetti, both of whom
were selected in the expansion
draft.

Two players currently have
their careers put on hold. Free
agent right wing Joe Mullen has
yet to re—sign with the Pens.
Even when (or if) he does sign,
he’ll miss at least the first
month of the season with a
knee injury he received in last
season’s playoffs against the
Rangers.

Right wing enforcer Jay
Caufield, also a free agent, may
not be offered a contract by the
Penguins. If that’s the case,
expect one of three things :
he’ll sign with Tampa Bay, sign
with a minor league team or
retire.

The Penguins have done
some signing of their own.
First of all, they signed goalie
Tom Barrasso to a long—term
contract and there’s talk that
the Pens are close to inking a
deal with Leinieux that would
keep the world’s best player in
Pittsburgh for the remainder of
his career.

In addition to signing within
their club, Pittsburgh has gone
out and acquired 31-year-old
Dave Tippett, a left wing who
has played for Washington and
Hartford.

' T ippett is a hard working,
defensive specialist whose

_ enthusiasm and experience

could make up for the loss of
Trottier.

Tippett’s best season was
the 1988-89 campaign’ when
he scored 17 goals and 41
points with the Whalers. Last
season in Washington, he
scored two goals and had ten
assists in 30 games. He also
played for the Canadian
Olympic team last season.

The Pens hope to have 20-
year-old Czechoslovakian cen-
ter Martin Straka signed for the
season. This year’s first-round
pick is expected to make the
team.

Pittsburgh also could have
1991’s first pick, Markus
Naslund, at some point this
season.

Cl‘ he 19-year-old forward is
expected to fulfill military
obligations in his homeland of
Sweden, but due to the current
condition on the left wing with
the loss of Bourque, Patrick
might step up efforts to get
Naslund before the 1993 sea-
son.

In addition to Mullen"s knee

_ condition, the Penguin injury

report isn’t Very optimistic.
Defenseman Ulf Samuelsson
will likely miss the first few
weeks of the season with a
knee injury while Francis is
recovering from off-season
knee surgery.

So the tale of adversity con-
tinues for the\Penguins. Did
you really expect anything else
from this team?

selections Jessica Paarlberg and Annie
Parisien.

They do return senior outside hitters
Andrea Carson and Aimee Mask, this
-year’s team captains. Carson was
Syracuse’s MVP last season as she
lead the Big East in defense with 3.94
digs per game. She and Mask are strong
defensive players, an area that was a
problem for the Orangewomen last sea-
son. Syracuse also has good size, with
six players over six feet tall.

Head coach Dick Shulte has said this
will be a rebuilding year for his team.
Providence College — The Lady
Friars finished only fifth in the
conference during the regular season,
20-9 overall, and 3-4 in the Big East.
They upset. Georgetown to reach the

tournament semifinals before being‘

swept by Pitt. They were the only team

, to win a game against the Panthers last

season. ,
Providence returns the 1991 Big East
rookie of the year, 5-foot-11-inch mid-
dle hitter Aileen Koproski. Team captain
Jennifer Winslow, a 6-foot middle hitter,
returns for her third year as a starter.
The Lady Friars could move up with
the losses of the top two teams. '
Georgetown University — The Hoyas
are one of four teams in the conference

with new coaches. Jolene Nagel takes '

over a team that finished fifth in the
postseason tournament after a ‘21-13 (4-

year.

Georgetown will be two-time all-confer-
ence selection Simone Kollman. The 5’-
10” senior outside hitter from

A major key to Nagel’s first season at

‘91.
Villanova University -—‘ The Wildcats
have an experienced team, with five
starters returning from last year’s group,
and a new coach, Ron Twomey.

T wome inherits a team that was 30-5

 

Mutterstadt, Germany led the Big East in
kills last season with an average of 4.8
per game. They did lose Lisa
MacDonald, who led the conference in
blocks last season, but return 6’—1”
senior middle hitter Heidi West, who
was fifth in blocks as well‘ as serving in

overall all last year in the regular sea-
son. Their conference record of 6-1 was
good for second place, but they were
upset in the tournament semifinals by
Syracuse. V ’

Setter Vicky Dispensa, a 5’-4” senior,
and outside hitter Pam Clifford, a 5’-9”

1:

senior, were both All-Big East selections
in ‘91. They are the top players in a
solid team that wins with strong
defense. The low ranking could be seen
as a surprise with so many players
returning from a strong team. ’
Seton Hall University — The Pirates
return four starters from a team that was
17-14 (2-5 in the conference) for a sixth-
place finish in the regular season. Tops
among them are two juniors, 5’—7”»
setter Casie Alexander and 5’—11” middle
blocker Andrea Kasper. Alexander
was the 1990 Big East Rookie of the
Year and led the conference in serving
last season. Kasper was fourth in
the Big East with a .296 hitting percent-
age.

University of Connecticut -— Former_
Penn State All-American Ellen Crandall
Orner was promoted from assistant
coach to take over the Huskies after
they finished seventh in the conference’
with a record of 10-17 overall, 1-6 in the
Big East. The top returning Husky is 5’-

8” senior setter Kara Brown, this year’s ’

team captain and last season’s team
M .
What Connecticut really needs is for
coach Orner to suit up and play.

Boston College — Nadine Lilanos
takes over a team coming, off a terrible
year in which they won only three of 24
matches before being blasted by Pitt in

the first round of the tournament. They ‘

do return five starters including senior
Anne Casey, a 5’—10” outside hitter.
