VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 101

Winner Malachi Handler enjoys his victory after Pitt
Program Council’s ‘80s Trivia game Thursday night.

u1"if/.¢'-.'

 

Knowing is more than half the  

battle for ‘80s Trivia contestants

KATHERINE BRINTON
Staff Writer

The contestants gripped
buzzers in sweaty palms, poised
and trigger—happy, waiting anx-
iously for the question. “What,
according to ‘G.I. Joe,’ was half
the battle?” asked the MC.
“Knowing,” was the answer.

A For contestant Malachi
Handler in last Thursday’s ‘80s
Trivia game show, knowing
“useless knowledge” such as
this won him a “Sony
Progressive Scan DVD/VCR
thing.”

Handler, a 20-year-old Film
Studies major, when asked how
he knew it all, said that he “built
a time machine out of cardboard
and old cigarettes to embarrass
his competitors.”

His final score was 25, as
compared to less impressive
scores of 10 and 12. And to the
victor went the spoils. Handler
plans to donate his high—tech
prize to the children of Somalia
because, according to Handler,
philanthropy is his biggest pas-
sion, wink, wink.

As part of Pitt Program
Council’s “Pitt Loves the ‘80s
Week,” student Izabell Musial,
who planned the event, labeled
it a success, saying that more
people showed up than expect-
ed.

The event featured different
categories of questions, ina for-
mat similar to ahigh school quiz
show, with politics, pop—culture,
music and television, to name a
few.

Finals round contestant Dan

Woods reminisced before the
competition about the ‘80s era:
“I was a fan of the ‘Turtles,’
‘The ‘Smurfs,’ and sometimes
‘He-Man.”’ He continued to say
that nothing could beat Nintendo
and the original “Zelda,” and
while Woods, with his “abun-
dance of ‘80s wisdom” did 11ot
win, he finished in good spirits,
“I have two DVD players;
I’m here for fun, but my
Grandma could use one,” said

. Woods.

Although the evening was
trouble—free, according to
Musial, there was a discussion
among the judges as to whether
one contestant said “Azrael” or
“Asmerial.”

Which one is the name of
Gargamel”s cat on “The
Smurfs”?

SGB selects new chairs,
reforms its committees

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer
S tu dent

Government Board

appointed chairs to eight commit-A

tees on Thursday.
SGB -announced its selections
for the heads of the Freshmen

Affairs, Judicial,
Environmental,
Public Relations,
T r a d i t i o n s ,
Diversity, Off-
Campus Housing,
and Academic

Affairs committees,
before allowing sev-
eral of the new

ing the meeting’s
open-ﬂoor period.

' “Our plans this
semester are to
maintain [our] recy-
cling program and
carry into the next
level the sustainable
campus idea,” said
Andrew Satchwell,
one of two new
chairs of the
Environmental
Committee. “We’re
going to be looking
into renewable ener-
gy standards for [the] campus.”

Satchwell spoke on behalf of the
committee’s other chair, Clare
Sierawski, outlining such plans as
the possible introduction of hybrid
cars -in Pitt’s motor system.

Samuel Friedman, of the Off-
Campus Housing Committee, said
that he is working with the Oakland
Development
Cooperation to create and distribute
to students 2,000 pamphlets,-which
will list important facts and phone
numbers for students looking to live
outside the University’s housing
system. '

None of the other newly
appointed chairs announced major
plans for their respective commit-
tees. They will, however, each be
asked to deliver a report at next
week’s meeting. -A

Board member Lauren Evette

Williams gave recommendations to

some of the committee chairs in
attendance.

“I would like [the Judicial
Committee] to take a look at the
elections code,” she said. “There’re
a lot of things that do need to be
clarified.”

Williams then voiced support
for the Environmental
Committee’s “Pitt
Project,” an annual
volunteer program run

. by SGB that is

streets of Oakland.

She also recommend”-
ed "that the »Off-
Campus Housing
Committee develop a
“one-stop guide” to
student housing,
which would contain
all the pertinent’ infor-
mation for prospec-
tive l-ease signers and
even cover such top-
ics as vicinity to
supermarkets and the

_ allowance of pets.

In addition to the
many committee chair
appointments,.. SGB
selected board mem-
ber Liz Blasi to be its
business manager and

Amit Kotz as. president pro tempore.
One seatleft vacant by the board
was the Government Relations
Committee chair.
Board member ToddiBrandon'

, Morris said the selection for a, chair

nominee will be done by ‘himself,
President Brian Kelly, board mem-

-ber Charis Jones and the outgoing

chair.

At the__ time of the meeting, the
decision was narrowed down to tw
candidates. '

Morris said they are looking for
someone with experience in lobby-
ing, an understanding of the struc-
ture of' SGB and knowledge in
regards to programs that will moti-
vate students to vote.

The Government Relations
Committee chair will also teach stu-
dents about absentee ballots and

encourage them ‘to vote after the

semester ends, Morris said.

Engineering men get all spruced up to strut their stuff, in

drag,as a part of the 50th anniversary of Pitt’s E-Week

LUCY LEITNER
Staff Writer

The interdepartmental engineer-
ing competition last Thursday
looked more like a drag pageant in a
hole-in—the—wall bar.

Male engineering students strut-
ted across the stage of Benedum
Auditorium in eveningwear that
ranged from shapeless frocks to
prom dresses, but all the contestants
looked more like Mrs. Doubtfire
than RuPaul. They stepped encum-
beredly in high heels and constrict-
ing women’s garb tosongs like ZZ
Top’s “Legs,” Survivor’s “Eye of
the Tiger,” and‘Aerosmith’s quin-

tessential drag anthem “Dude
(Looks like a Lady).”
The second annual Mr.

Benedum competition was part of
the seven-day event “E—Week,’T dur-
ing which the eight departments in
the engineering school compete
against each other. Janie Haven, a
sophomore and an E-week chair,
described the drag show as just one
of the activities of the week. She
mentioned that engineers had

“That is the price you pay for
going on Semester at Sea,” joked
Professor Donald Gogniat, the ship
instructor for Core.

Gogniat, an administrator from
Pennsylvania State University who
received his doctorate in cultural
geography at Pitt, was pleased by
the reactions to what was certainly
a challenging first port-of-call.

“Confusion is a wonderful
thing,” he said. “When you’re con—
fused, it means you’re thinking. I
love that.” A.

While he said he is pleased with
theenthusiasm of the students, he
hopes they keep the class in per-
spective and remember why they’re
here. ’

“People are concerned about
their grades, but they are also wor-
ried about their grades,” he said.
Gogniat hopes that students will
study hard because they genuinely

want to learn about the culture and’-

issues facing the countries to which

.‘ they are traveling — not simply to

get by. -

ment, ’ will be the day that a

learned knowledge. ‘

feehouse and have a conversation

Terry described the atmosphere

Nominations forthe Nobel Peace Prize

Nominations for the 2004 Nobel
Peace Prize have drawn to a close.

Among the nominees for the
prize, to be awarded in October,
include President George W. Bush
and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, for their efforts in the Iraq war.

They join such nominees as Nazi
dictator Adolf Hitler and former
Yugoslav president
Milosevic, and could join winners
such as Palestinian president Yasser
Arafat and former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger.

What, exactly, are the criteria for
being nominated for or awarded the
Peace Prize?

Bush and Blair were nominated
by Jan Simonsen, a member of
Norway’s Parliament, who said that
getting rid of Saddam Hussein made
the world a safer place.

It’s unarguable that Hussein was
a crazed dictator and that deposing
him was important. However, it was
an.action that required violence and
loss of life. It was an action that took,
in a word, war.

Isn,’t~ “war
“peace?”

How can two architects of war —-
regardless of whether said war was
just or not, regardless of the true
motives for going in — be nominated
for the highest peace prize in the
land?

$9

the opposite of

Slobodan _

Some excellent examples of

, humanity have been awarded the

prize in years past. Tenzin Gyatso,
14th Dalai Lama, won the prize.
Nelson Mandela, president of the
African National Congress and anti-
apartheid crusader, won the prize.
The organization Doctors Without
Borders won the prize. _

These winners have in common a
desire for peace, a value for human
life and fairness above any political
or partisan goals. It seems that these
should be the deciding criteria’ in
being awarded a peace prize '-—'not
achievement of a goal that may or
may not eventually lead to a hard-
fought “peace,” complete with great
loss of human life. ' e

These winners also share another
common characteristic. The prize
itself probably meant little to them —
they are the kind of people, who
would gladly toil in obscurity_ to
achieve their noble goals. Their
actions were the true rewards for
these humble, peaceful people. Don’t
be surprised to see the Bush camp

touting the nomination in re-election“

advertising.

It is unlikely that Bush or Blair
will take the honor —— both are too
steeped in controversy. Bush has led
hundreds of American troops and
Iraqi soldiers, and civilians to their
deaths — hardly peaceful.

Oakland slightly less habitable than the

Humanity can’t go on like this, and

As long as the temperature , in
Pittsburgh refuses to climb above 65
degrees Fahrenheit (sure, that isn’t realistic
for this time of year, but it’s a good point
from which to begin bargaining with
whomever it is that controls the weather),
Pitt students should abstain from so much

as leaving their places of residence —- be it ‘

dorm, apartment, or the taco stand at
Eddie’s — for purposes’ oﬂier ﬂian to
attend a really bitchin’ party.*This means
no grocery shopping, no trips to the gym,
and no class, whatsoever. 4

of extra time on your hands. As the founder

severity of the climatic situation and be
kind enough not to place all boycott partic-

enough to follow me can simply stay"

inside and attempt to outlast the icy wrath
of winter’s iron ﬁst.

She just can’t get enough of his love, baby — ouch

Dear Sex N’at Readers:

Before I get started with this week’s
question, I must address something I said
last week. In telling a questioner how to
do the mattress mambo in places other
than on a mattress, I advised them to, “get
into the habit of keeping whatever fonn
of protection you use in your pocket,” so
they could get ready to bump uglies at a
moment’s notice. This was less—than—stel—
lar advice, See, if that form of protection
is a latex condom, and last week’s adven-
turers ‘start keeping condoms in their
pockets at all times, disaster could be
looming.

Keeping a condom that close ‘to a
warm body for any length of time can
cause the latex to deteriorate, greatly 1ess—
ening its effectiveness. Keeping a con-
dom in a wallet, too, is a terrible idea,
because it gets sat on and possibly poked
by bills. I knew a girl years ago who kept
her stash in an Altoids tin in her purse.
That was contraceptive innovation, and
I’d advise all of you to try doing the same
or something similar. If you know that
you’ll be boning very shortly and you
want to slip one in your pocket, just for a
Very short time, that’s okay, but do not
store them there.

Dear Sex N’at:

As with most college campuses, Pitt
has its share of on—campus romances, but
it also has its share of long-distance rela-
tionships, for example, myself. It’s kind
of hard to keep a long-distance relation-
ship going, but we’re managing pretty
well. We’ve both agreed to be monoga-
mous and not sleep with other people
‘cause we respect each other like that, and
every time he blows into town, we can’t
keep our hands off eachother and'it’s a
pretty — ahem — gratifying time had by
all. Quite a joyous reunion, let me tell
you. The only problem is, with his visits
to_Pitt so few and far between, it doesn’t
take long before I get too sore to accom-
modate, no matter how willing I am.
Picture this: He’s ready, willing, and able,
and I’m pretty ready and willing  but
not quite as able. It’s kind ‘of hard to enjoy
playing hide-the-salami when it feels like
I’m being rubbed raw down there, which
is pretty frustrating, to say the least. I’ve
checked it out with my gynecologist, and

I’m free and clear, and I’ve also tried

lube, to no avail. Any suggestions on any
positions/methods/anything that might
help a horny college girl out?

There’s no particular

Finally, if it’s simply too painful,
there’s no reason to keep insisting on

Bringyour passion to the job, even if itmight be the worst ever

I love passionate people.
Unfortunately, ﬁnding a truly passionate
person is as common as ordering a sand-
wich and getting it made in less than ﬁf-
teen minutes at the Pete.

There are people who are passionate
about sports. They live and breathe com-
petition, and for them, every situation in
life somehow becomes a sports analogy.
My father is a prime example of this.
During a particularly rough stretch in
high school, my lack of academic apti-
tude somehow spurred the lecture,
“Colleen, school is just like‘ a baseball
game ...” Sure thing, Dad.

There are people who are passionate
about music. They manage to express

everything that is going on in their lives
through melody or lyrics. This type

passion is particularly
endearing when the posses-
sor is extraordinarily talent-
ed. Inbom musical talent is
one of the sexiest qualities
around. How do you think

guys like Billy Joel wind up
with chicks like Christie
Brinkley? C

Passionate people can

pop up in a variety of areas

— art, fashion, movies, writ-
ing  the list goes on and
on. I think the kind of pas-

sion that is the most interesting is when

people can take the most mundane and

of low—caliber everyday chore and turn it

into a task ﬁt to suit the pres-
ence of the Queen of
England. .

Over the holiday break,
while finishing up my
Christmas shopping and
cursing the fact that nothing
the people on my list want is
ever on sale, I went to use
the crosswalk to switch
»malls from‘ the King of
Prussia Plaza to the Court.
This is a pedestrian walkway
that, during the holiday sea-
son, warrants its very own crossing guard

 

. cab2357@.pitt._edu..   . . _  .\

to control the ever-present danger that is
the traffic patterns of a plethora of
Christmas shoppers ‘armed with credit
cards. I

_ The crossing guard was a guy in his
-early 20s who had most likely picked up
the job as a way to earn some extra cash
between semesters. Now, if it was me or
anyone «else in his shoes, I probably
would have stood there looking miser-
able, giving feeble gestures to indicate
which ‘set of shoppers should stop and
which should go. After one day, anyone
else would go home annoyed as hell and
promptly call in to resign. No amount of
money would render such a crap job wor-

‘thy of the [ seconds that had just ticked

away off the clock of “much better ways
to’ spend time.” A

This guy was a different story. He
stood there, head held high, a look of
ﬁerce determination on his face, and
directed trafﬁc as if he was on a mission
from the president. The directional sig-
nals he made with his arms were crisp
and fresh, and not even the most resolute
of insane holiday shoppers dared to cross
at a time that the guard did not speciﬁcal-
lyallot to them. The passion of this cross-
ing guard caught my attention, but I was
still skeptical. Being the cynic that I am,
(one can insert the phrase “pathetic loser”
for cynic) I made a conscious effort to
cross later in the day to see if this guy was
for real. I

i

After two safe crossings, I’m happy

I to report that this crossing guard was the

real McCoy. No irate shopper or gust of
freezing winterxwind could deter this man
from his job. He displayed the kind of
passion and work ethic most people
could only dream of. To top it off, his pas-
sion was obvious even while doing a job
not characteristically marked by enthusi-
asm or zeal — like sports, music or art.
The world could use a few more ‘passion-
ate people like this traffic monitor. Just
think of how much more fulﬁlling your
day would be if instead of making a trip
to the gym seem like 'a chore, it was sud-

denly a personal gratiﬁcation of -physical ~
"wellness. Or perhaps doing your laundry

could go from being a twice—monthly
pain in the ass to ‘a celebration of cleanli-
ness and superior individual hygiene.

A lot can be learned from the pas-
sionate people of the world. It appears a
bit daunting to attempt to make every-
thing that is seemingly asinine into a
worthwhile and life-altering undertaking,
but the journey of a thousand _ miles
begins with a single step; So go out and,
instead of just reading that pile of books
on your desk, absorb and retain the
wealth of information being presented.
Completing even the most ordinary of
daily tasks with a bit of positivity’and
passion could make anyone feel a .little
more satisﬁed and useful.

The canvas is two-dimensional,
but the face on the canvas is not.

Portraits become complex char-
acter studies at the hands of regional
artists Deanne Dunbar and Ben
Gersch, whose works are currently
on exhibit in The Brew House Space
101’si “Prospectus One.” Though the
artists have strikingly different por-
traiture styles, the glances and ges-
tures of their subjects reveal the
artists’ similar interest in the depic-
tion of personality complexities. -

Dunbar’s
“Emerging Artist” series reveals the
deep and surprising contradictions at
the core of a young woman. .

In each 24-by-36-inch portrait,
the same thin, cartoon-like, young
girl stares out at the viewer from
behind black pigtails. The complexi-
ty of .emotion and intention in each
piece is shocking and enthralling.

“J oe” dumber than “Average” reality show

KATHERINE WHITE
Northwestern (Northwestern U.)

(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, Ill. —
Imagine readinga casting call for at
new reality series, asking for men who
consider themselves “thelife of the
party.” Then, imagine arriving at a

‘ tropical mansion, complete with pool

and hot tub. As you look around, you
realize the other contestants of this
reality show aren’t exactly what you’d
call “Bachelor” material. On top of all
that, you meet a less-than—ecstat,ic for-

. mer beauty queen, get slapped with

the label “average” and then, just as
things are looking up, a slew o,f
“hunks-” enter the mix. Clearly, they
would also be vying for the affection
of a woman who claims. that looks
ar_en’t important. Welcome to the latest
reality TV gimmick, NBC’s “Average
Joe.”

The surprising hit of last fall
hooked viewers with ads that took
clips of scantily—cl_ad single. gal
Melana running on a beach and of her
facial reactions as she was introduced
to her batch of bachelors.

I started watching halfway
through the season, when Melana
dressed up in a fat suit and pretended
to be her cousin, to see how the suitors
reacted when the roles reversed. As
the “hunks” remained relatively quiet
on the matter, Zach and Adam, the

.original average Joes, bashed the

cousin, introducing America to the
term “DUFF” — Designated Ugly, Fat
Friend. A

Which leads me to wonder, in a
genre that constantly introduces new
takes on a bored concept, why isn’t

there a show called “Average Jane?” .

With the tables reversed, how would a
“hunk” react when introduced to a
slew of obese, acne—ridden or gangly
women?

Both Melana and Larissa, from

However, as many pointed out,
Melana’s two remaining average Joes
weren’t all that unattractive. Yet she
still astonished viewers by choosing
pretty boy Jason, who still lived at
home with his parents, over funny and
successful Adam, who showered her
with attention and, when it comes
down to it, wasn’t actually “average”
at all. A’ A ' ‘

" Maybe the ‘real question is
whether viewers would tune in to see a
bunch of plain J anes. After all, my guy
friends were A the ones watching
“Average Joe” from the beginning,
and I ‘only tuned in to see how these

guys treated a woman without
Melana’s beauty queen figure.

Yet what kept me watching was a
desire to see Adam beat out the lack-
luster Jason in the race for Melana’s
superficial heart. As one of my room-
mates explained, “The people watch-
ing that show were guys, drooling
over the would-be swimsuit model and
hoping that if an average Joe could get
a kiss from her, then maybe they could
too.” A

A I highly doubt these same droolers
would tune in to see plain Janes win
kisses from a hunk each week. For that
matter, I don’t think I would, either.

Remember the first time you
returned home after being away at
school for a few months? Everyone
was making such a big fuss over the
adult you’d become. Mom was anx-
ious to cook your favorite meal, and
Dad was ready to hear all about
campus life. Now just imagine that,
instead of being away for a few
months at school, you were gon
for three years at w-ar. ‘

In “The Subject Was Roses,”
Timmy Cleary returns home from
World War II to parents who fawn,
if not fight, over him. They’re both
so happy to have him back, but for
all the wrong reasons. Timmy’s
father is looking for a trophy son to
tote around and show off to the
community. His admiration borders
on jealousy as he sees in his son the
young man he used to be. Timmy’s
mother is still trying to hold on to
the boy who left three years ago.
She’s not prepared for the 21-year-
old, beer-chugging man‘ who
returns. Both parents are glad to
have him back because it removes
the spotlight from their own rocky,
fight-filled marriage.

a serious side of the play creeps

along slowly. But Gilroy is able to
keep the script ﬂowing by toying

_with his audience’s emotions. He

quickly interrupts comedic
moments with unexpected harsh
comments. When Timmy. jokes
about how he’s grown out of his old
clothes, his father coldly replies,
“Maybe you haven’t grown as much
as you think.”

The stage is an impressive
recreation of a small 1940s New
York apartment. Mismatched furni-
ture and assorted lamps create a
homey living room replete with old
copies of Life magazine next to the
recliner. But the script and -set

.would be nothing without talented

actors to bring the play to life.
Ross Bickell and Carole
Monferdini both shine as the par-
ents. Bickell shouts with such rage
that his face is an unhealthy shade
of red by the play’s end. Monferdini
plays the overly concerned mother
role with quiet simplicity. But it is
Joe Delafield’s role of Timmy that

deserves the praise. His youthful

charm and drunken gibberish are
humorous, yet meaningful. He and
Monferdini play warmly off of each
other in a realistic portrayal of
mother and son. , .
“The Subject Was Roses” com-
bines great acting with an intelli-
gent script and brings a pertinent
subject to the
Pittsburgh Public Theatre. _

O.A.R. set to deliver more jam band goodness to ‘Burgh

How many times has someone
put on “Crazy Game of Poker” and
the party just erupts?Every person in
attendance sings along with the raspy
voice of Marc Roberge, and the jam
— some versions last more than 10
minutes — puts everyone in a great
mood. ‘ 0

Multiply that energy found in a
house party by a couple hundred peo-
ple and that’s what you get from an
O.A.R concert. And with the addition
of another 12 songs, maybe more, the
energy runs from the opening of the
set to the very last song.

, O.A.R formed in 1996 when lead A
singer Marc. Roberge and drummer

ChrisiCulos started playing together.
With the addition of bassist Benj
Gershman and guitarist Richard On,
they went on to attend Ohio State
University where they met saxophon-
ist Jerry DiPizzo.

With a style that they call
“island-vibe—roots-rock,” every live
show is different when O.A.R takes
the stage. Whether as an opener or
headliner, or even in a festival setting
like the Sprite Liquid Remix Tour,
which they were on the last time they
were in Pittsburgh, they take the
stage with energy and play their best
possible set. ,

But a lot of the band’s energy
comes from the crowd response. “Our
shows rely very heavily on the ener-
gy of the crowd,” Culos said the last

‘time O.A.R. was in Pittsburgh. “We

go up there every night and play 110
percent, but that doesn’t mean we
have to be dancing around the stage
and going crazy to give 110 percent.”

O.A.R sports a great mix of songs

to hop around to as well as more laid
back tunes that have a lot of emotion
running through the lyrics. They do
an incredible job of mixing the two
different styles of songs, and they are
able to keep the audience in the show
no matter what song they play.

Starting out under the radar, and
almost underground, O.A.R signed
with Lava Records last year and put

out theirmajor label debut album In

“We have opportunities to be on

the radio and on television,” Culos‘

remarked about signing with Lava
Records, “Which is limited for a band
that is on an independent label to
actually break through.” _ .

And the exposure that they have
gained from being on Lava Records
is a huge boost for a band that, like
O.A.R, still constantly tours, because
that remains the best way to get the
word out about their music. And
O.A.R has had success on the road,
having the opportunity to play with
the likes of N.E.R.D on the Liquid
Remix Tour, as well as with 311 this
past fall.

Also .-taking the stage Tuesday .

night is Robert Randolph and the
Family Band. Robert Randolph is one
of the most impressive steel guitar
players in the business,. and the last
time he was in Pittsburgh was for the
Liquid Remix Tour as well. To close
out his set last time he was in
Pittsburgh, he played a cover of Jimi
Hendrix’s’“Purple Haze” that might
be one of the most incredible covers
ever played by one man and a steel
guitar. With the combination of
O.A.R. and Robert Randolph, this
show sets itself up to beseveral hours
of non-stop jamming. And what could
be better than that‘?

O.A.R. and Robert Randolph will be
performing an all-ages show at the
A]. Palumbo Center on Tuesday at
7:30 p.m. Tickets are $28 in advance
and $30 the day of the‘ show. For

Of the venues mentioned,

like Palumbo and fewer like
Rosebud, local music is essentially
on its deathbed. Bands are being cut
off at the knees with nowhere to
spread the word about their music.
A lot of local talent is being forced
to play basement parties, most often
in South Oakland. The logic is that
some of these bands would have a
struggle filling a large venue any-
way, but maybe some of them just
might be able to pull their own
weight. But without the venues to

Now there is nowhere for a band
to get started, and no, you can’t
work your way from a South
Oakland basement to a national
headlining tour. That is, unless your
houseguests are some pretty impor-
tant people. T ‘

So what’s the solution?

Well, that’s the million-dollar

and when shows aren’t pulling in
the people that they should, it hurts
even more.

Frankly, the music scene in
Pittsburgh is dying, and a lot of the

blame lies with the population of.

the city. Most of the people who
live in the city_are old. They aren’t
going to support local music
because they don’t listen to that
type of music. It’s too loud. It’s not

Elvis, I know, but some of it is good ‘
T music.

The powers that be are trying to
keep young people from leaving
Pittsburgh after they are finished
with their schooling. But why
shouldn’t they? Without the oppor-
tunity for good jobs, and a chance
to make a future for themselves,

there is no reason to stay here. And

if music continues to be rubbed out
and scratched out of the image of
the city, then young people are most
certainly not going_to stay because

they are being deprived of some— »

thing that they enjoy.

People need to be aware of what
is out there. Spread the word about
a band that you. may have heard
about, use the technology that we
hold at our hands and burn some
copies of that new local band’s CD
that everyone should listen to.
Expose your friends to a group that
you caught in a dirty basement at a
random house party.

Open your eyes and ears and go i

into it with an open mind;- take a
chance. Who knows; you might
actually leave having found a new
favorite band. -

Pitt stumbles against Mountaineers

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

With almost four minutes gone
in the game, Pitt forward Sheila
Stufﬂet drove through the lane and
hit a pull-up jump shot to cut West
Virginia’s lead to one.

And that was as close as the
women’s basketball team would get
to defeating the Mountaineers.

A minute later, West Virginia
guard Sherell Sowho hit a three-
pointer to extend the Mountaineers
lead to 7-3. The Mountaineers’
offense did not stop there, as West
Virginia wenton to build a 20-point
lead with 4:19 remaining in the first
half. '

fourth straight Big East conference
game, 56-36, on Saturday afternoon
at the Petersen Events Center. ,
With the score 7-3, Sowho, who
finished the game with 13 points, and
eight rebounds, pulled down an
offensive rebound and dished the
ball to senior forward Michelle
Carter. Carter drove into the lane,
spun around a Pitt defender, and laid

the ball in.

On the next Mountaineer (15-5,
6-2) possession, Pitt guard Brooke
Hughes fell down trying to defend
senior guard Kate Bulger.

Kate Bulger drove into the paint
and passed it to her sister, freshman
guard Meg Bulger. Meg Bulger took
the pass and laid the ball in to put
West Virginia up 11-5.

The Mountaineers then went on a
20-6 run over the next nine minutes,
with Meg Bulger leading the way.-

Sowho and Meg Bulger connect-

MATT MILOSZWESKI
Staff Writer

There has been some talk that the
Pitt women’s basketball team was close
to being competitive in the Big East
conference. Saturday was a reminder of
how far they still must go.

The West Virginia Mountaineers
came into Pittsburgh with a record of
14-5 overall, 5-2 in the Big East confer-
ence, and the Panthers had hopes of an
upset. In the previous matchup, the
Panthers lost, 65-58, and were without
starting point‘ guard Amy Kunich.

Kunich would make a difference,
and the Panthers had a shot, right? Not
even close.

The Mountaineers came out and

“West Virginia is third in the con-

head coach Agnus Berenato. “Paige
does a great job of penetrating and run-
ning their offense.”

“We prepared for [Pitt’s defense],
and I was pretty much ready for it,” said
Paige after the game. V

Paige was more than prepared; she
put on a clinic of how to run an efﬁcient
fast break.

“Paige is one of the top - point
guards in the country; she is very
good,” West Virginia head coach Mike
Carey said. “She leads the Big East in

And you thought ESPN was
just pulling your leg.

Guess what? There really are
people out there who are proud to
be Nimrods.

If you do not know what I’m
talking about, ESPN has been
running a set of commercials that
show athletes from a high school
in Watersmeet, Mich.

It shows students and athletes who are currently
enrolled or who have graduated as proud Nimrods.

That’s right. They allow Nimrods to graduate in
the state of Michigan. '

Personally, I toss around the term Nimrod like
nothing else. For example, don’t tell him I said this,
but my little brother is a Nimrod. My roommate,
Travis — he, too, is a Nimrod.

' But the definition for these Nimrods in
Watersmeet is completely different.

By Biblical accounts, Nimrod was “a mighty
hunter before the Lord.” The people of Watersmeet
chose the nickname back in 1904 because the region
was a prime area for hunting.

At first, I thought ESPN made this all up for my
entertainment, but after watching the commercial
for the 100th time, I began to wonder if there were
really Nin1rods playing basketball.

After finding out that Nimrods really do exist, I
said to myself, “What other nicknames are there that
no one on earth would believe?”

Lo and behold! I found a poll from 1986 by
ESPN, which had the top ten high school nick-
names. Outdated for sure, but also amusing.

SP9

    

The Nimrods were ranked
No. 3 on this top ten list. Ahead of
them were the Syrupmakers of
Cairo, Ga., and the Beetdiggers of
Brush, Colo.

Another team nickname in
the top ten was the Squirrels, who
hail from Winslow, Ariz. The
squirrel is an interesting creature,
but you are more likely to find
them lying on the side of the road or deep-fried on
the plate of a redneck, than on the football field win-
ning a big game.

Other nicknames on the list I felt were worth
mentioning were the Flivvers of Kingsford, Mich.,
and the Atomsmashers of Johnson Prep in
Savannah, Ga. ‘

As for the Flivvers, it took a dictionary for me
to find, out what it is. According to my friend
Webster, it’s an automobile, especially one that is
small and inexpensive — so, basically, a Kia.

How would you like to be a Kia? I know I hate
driving behind them on the road, and know I would-
n’t want to be in one, for that matter. If you were a
Flivver, there would be only one certainty — you’d
easily run over the Squirrels.

The Atomsmashers is a more masculine team
name than the Flivvers, but not by much. I mean,
they smash atoms. How big are they anyway?

View

‘”\"€i

My absolute favorite on this list is the Peglegs~

of Stuyvesant in New York City. I wish my high
school team had played these guys. I would have
called out signals like a pirate all day.

All of the names on this list crack me up and

Searching to see if the Nimrods really do exist

force me to ask the question, “Why?” Why would
anyone want to be a Nimrod or a Flivver?

I’m used to the traditional names. For example,
in high school, I was a quarterback for the
Cardinals, and in junior high, I was quarterbacking
the Bears. ’

Now that I’Ve finished laughing, I will give the
founding fathers of these nicknames credit. They
were original in their ideas, but in their choice of
nicknames, they were ﬂat—out Nimrods.

Jimmy Johnson is a staﬁ’ writer for The Pitt News,
and he ’s bitter over the fact that some Nimrod prob-
ably graduated with a higher GPA than he did.

How to use Roman numerals,thanks to the Super Bowl

4 time, and I’m going‘ to guess that it

   

_ Roman numerals. Are they num-
bers or are they letters?

Would we know — or would we
even care — without the"Super
Bowl? ,

Where else do you see Roman
numerals used other than the Super
Bowl? All right, sometimes they’re
used to represent years, they might
-be on a clock, and pages in the
introduction of a book are numbered
with them. 4 ,

But it’s kind of confusing just
trying to figure them out, and even
more so if you try to include them in
a sentence. Here, I’ll show you. V

Sunday’s matchup between the
New England Patriots and ‘the
Carolina Panthers was the
XXXVIIIth Super Bowl played, if
you use those letters the Romans
called numbers. ~

If you go way back and include
the championship games played
before the Super Bowl, there have
been LXXI — or 71, for those of
you who aren’t sure how Caesar
counted his conspirators — title
games played in NFL history.

But that was Well before my

.,

  3Eb£A’S .

was before your time,-too, so let’s
stick to what we know. _

The Super Bowl has at times
been a stage for some of the greatest
players of‘ the game to perform.
Sometimes those players step up,
and sometimes those players fall on
their faces. _

Probably, no one knows that bet-
ter than John Elway, who led the
Denver Broncos to V Super Bowls,
but was only able to win II of them.

In his first III title games,
Elway’s Broncos lost by a combined
score of CXXXVI-XX, or 136-20.
Not very good for a guy who was

elected to the Hall of Fame last.

weekend. ’

Butin the other II games, the
Broncos came out victorious, and
Elway was named the Most
Valuable Player of Super Bowl
XXXIII.

Not too many players get more
than I shot at redemption, however’.

Until recently, Fran Tarkenton
held every significant career regular
season passing record in’ history and
he led the Minnesota Vikings to III
Super Bowls as their quarterback.

But the Vikings lost all of them,
and Tarkenton, who threw VI inter-
ceptions in those III. games, never
had the chance to play in another
Super Bowl. ' -

The same goes for Dan Marino,
who broke all of Tarkenton’s pass-
ing records.

In his rookie season, Marino led

the Miami Dolphins to Super Bowl
XIX, but lost to the XLIXers,
XXXVIII-XVI — 38-16 by the
49ers, if you haven’t caught on to
the letters that are numbers thing.

Marino played another XV sea-
sons in the NFL and never played in
another Super Bowl. In fact, for all’
the success that he had in the regu-
lar season, Marino’s Dolphins only
made it back to the conference
championship game II more times.

Other greats lived for the big
games. Take the quarterback on the
other side of Marino’s only Super
Bowl appearance for example.

Joe Montana played in IV Super
Bowls for San Francisco in his
career, winning all of them.
Montana was named MVP a record
III times and also holds the all—time
Super Bowl records for passer rat-
ing, completed passes and yards
gained. 4

By the way, I would have con-
verted those records into Roman
numerals, but’ it seems that the
Romans didn’t know what decimals
were, or at least they had no way of
representing them. Therefore, it is

impossible to convert a passer rat-

ing into Roman numerals.

There was Joe Namath’s predic-
tion in Super Bowl III, Lynn
Swann’s acrobatic catches in Super
Bowl X and Marcus Allen’s LXXIV—
yard — or 74-yard — touchdown
run in Super Bowl XVII.

All III arelasting images from
the biggest game of the year, and all

III« players were named the MVP of
their respective games.

The Super Bowl can also intro-
duce the world to guys that no one
has ever really heard of.

Washington rookie running back
Timmy ‘Smith rushed for CCIV
yards —— also known as a record 204
yards —— in Super Bowl XXII to
help the Redskins to the 'win.

Dallas cornerback Larry Brown
intercepted II passes in Super Bowl
XXX to help boost his name in the
free agent market the following
year, as did Tampa Bay safety
Dexter Jackson after he picked off
II passes in the XXXVIIth Super
Bowl last season,

The Super Bowl also brought
Desmond Howard back from the
scrap heap. Howard, who had
flopped as a pro after winning the
Heisman Trophy, tied a Super Bowl
record with CCXXIV return yards
in Green Bay’s victory in Super
Bowl XXXI.

I thought about converting that
last stat for you, but if I do it, you’re
never going to learn. And since you
probably~don’t know what those let-
ters stand for, you’ll never know
how many return yards Howard had.

And if it weren’t for the Super
Bowl, Roman numerals would just
be  annoying letters that are used
to represent numbers.

Joe Marchilena is the sports editor
for The Pitt News, and he can count
to LXXXVIII in Roman numerals.

THE PITT NEWS.

Monday, February 2, 2004

LAURA THOMAS/PHOTO EDITOR

Pitt’s Allisha Morris puts a shot up over two West Virginia defenders during the
Panthers’ loss to the Mountaineers on Saturday.

Loss, page 15

tional foul in the second half led to
five West Virginia points, Pitt’s fate
was sealed.

Sowho ran down the court on a
fast break and was intentionally
fouled from behind. She hit both of
her free throws and Kate Bulger
nailed a three-pointer on the inbound
to give West Virginia a 46-28 lead.

“We said [in practices leading up
to the game] we were not going to be
Bulgerized,” said Pitt head coach
Agnus Berenato.

Berenato said she’d sleep happy
because Kate Bulger, West
Virginia’s leading scorer, didn’t
score 28 points. She finished the
game with seven points and eight
rebounds, and her sister finished the
game with seven rebounds and 13
points — ll of which came in the
first half.

The score was deceiving in that
the Panthers did a good job defen-
sively, holding the Mountaineers to
56 points. Berenato was pleased
because West Virginia had averaged
69.2 points per game before
Saturday’s game.

The problem lay in the Panthers
failure on shots. Pitt finished the
game only hitting 26.9 percent of

Panthers drop fourth consecutive Big East conference game

shots taken.

Another area for concern was
rebounding. West Virginia out-
rebounded Pitt 52-34.

“Rebounding was definitely a
factor,” Berenato said, adding that
West Virginia held a two-to—one
rebound advantage in the first half.
“The second half, they went to
town.”

Paige finished with six points
and 11 assists. Eight of those assists
came in the first half and fueled
West Virginia’s run.

“The reason she didn’t set our
school record is because we didn’t
hit a shot in the second half,” West
Virginia head coach Mike Carey
said, referring to the fact his team
only made 20.6 percent of their shots
in the second half.

Pitt forward LaToya Kincaid had
trouble from the ﬂoor, hitting only
three of 13 field goals. She did, how-
ever, pull down 12 rebounds, which
led both teams. ‘

Freshman forward Jennifer
Brown came off the bench, notching
17 minutes of playing time, and led
the Panthers in scoring with eight
points

The Panthers are back in action
on Thursday at Boston College. Tip-
offis scheduled for 7 p.m.

person.”
Time after time, following a
Panthers miss or turnover, Paige, who

had 11 assists, would receive an outlet 7

pass and push the ball down the floor.
Paige almost always hit a wide-open
Mountaineer and it seemed to always
result in points.

The Panthers did what they could to
slow Paige and the West Virginia
offense, and they werersuccessful in the
half-court but not the fast break. Thanks
to a tough, physical defense, the
Mountaineers forced 17 Pitt turnovers
and made 10 steals, all of which set up
the Mountaineers fast break.

“Our defense was great,” Carey.

said. “We get several easy chances on
the other side because of it.”

“West Virginia was just bigger,
faster, stronger and quicker — that’s it,”
said Berenato. The Panthers did what
they could to slow the break, even hav-

ing all three of their point guards —-3
Stacy Moore, Brooke Hughes and
Kunich — attempt to slow down Paige.
The Panther offense did not give
Pitt much help, though. The Panthers’
poor shooting set up the easy chances
the Mountaineers continually had. Pitt
was just 14-of-52 from the ﬂoor and
shooting 26.9 percent for the game.

“We did a good job on defense,

holding them to 56 points,” Berenato
said. “They average in the ,70s,-so we
did a good jo .” T

No matter who the Panthers had on
the court, the cork refused to leave the
Panthers rim.

“We had great looks the whole
game; we just missed the shots,”
Berenato said. “This is the first time I
have ever had a team only make 14 bas-
kets in my [coaching] career.”

An inability to stop a fast break and '

some shooting woes is recipe for disas-
ter, and the result on Saturday proved
that. K
