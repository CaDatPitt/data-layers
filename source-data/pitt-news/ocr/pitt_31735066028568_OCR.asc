Speaker questions cl woman's choice

By Stephanie Ellsworth
Staff Writer

Dr. Mildred Fay Jefferson, the first African—American woman
to graduate from Harvard University and the president of Right
to Life Crusade, spoke in the William Pitt Union ballroom last
night.

Jefferson said she has been to Pittsburgh many times, because
“Pennsylvania itself is one of the core states in the national
Right to Life network.” Last night, however, was her first time
addressing Pitt students.

Jefferson described the right to life as the “most critical debate
any of us will ever be involved in in our lifetimes.”

“The battle is about what the choice is,” she said. Jefferson
said that a pregnant woman has only two choices —— to end the
pregnancy by giving birth to the child or"‘to choose a skillful
abortionist to end the pregnancy with a dead baby.”

According to Jefferson, when a woman chooses to aborta
child, she may have given up her only chance to be pregnant.
Younger women who have abortions have a higher instance of
sterility during their second attempt at pregnancy, Jefferson said.
“Yet, we still see the sales pitch,” she said. I

Jefferson said abortion and the right to choose is often regard-

ed as an assertion of a woman’s control and power over her own
body. “No woman really has control over her own fertility, but
she can destroy it very easily,” she said. “But when a woman is
on an operating table, she is not in control.”

Jefferson said abortion is a movement against the poor, which
she likened to a class war. “I don’t want [this country] to become
a place where only the privileged have the right to live,” she
said.

She said she became a doctor to “save lives, not to destroy
them.” Jefferson believes that American society needs to correct
the problem before it is too late.

“[The human race] is like a tapestry. You cannot destroy any
part of it without destroying the whole tapestry,” she said. “What
affects part of our family affects all of it.”

Jefferson said she will do everything in her power to uphold
the right to life that she so strongly supports. “I will not give up
the role of healer to become the social executioner.”

Jefferson serves as assistant clinical professor of surgery at
Boston University Medical School. She said she is unsure of her
position there now because of a merger with Boston City
Hospital, where she was the first woman to intern in surgery.
Jefferson is also the recipient of numerous awards and 28 hon-
orary degrees from various American universities and colleges.

Students to
get new IDs

As the first step in converting

students can pay for everything
from concert tickets to laundry
without using any cash, the
Department of Food Services will
be issuing new IDs to students
which will become effective in
January.

The new ID will feature a mag-
netic strip, replacing the bar codes
that are on the currently valid
cards. 1

“These cards will -make the qual-
ity of life for students on campus
better,” said Betsy Sallade-Farina,
director of Food Services. _

According to Sallade-Farina,
these new cards with magnetic
strips, or “mag stripe” cards, are

the key to Pitt’s becoming a one-

card campus. Eventually, students
will be able to use the cards to pur-
chase books, pay for washers and
dryers and even pay cab fare.

Pitt has nontraditional students

The cards are intended to be used
initially to speed processing when
purchasing meals and to cut down
on the lines at Pitt’s dining facili-
ties.

“The magnetic strip will definite-
ly reduce [delays] and make pro-
cessing easier,” said Ra1ph'Hertle
of Pitt’s Information Resource
Department.

With the current IDs, 25 percent
of the transactions processed are
defaulted, and the cashier must
manually type in the student’s bar
code number. This leads to lengthy
delays during crowded eating peri-
ods. The cash registers purchased
by Marriott. as part of its agree-
ment with Pitt, are already
equipped to handle the mag stripes.

Plans are also underway to con-
vert vending machines on campus

For the Pitt News

Approximately half of of the students
who attend the College of General
Studies at Pitt are nontraditional stu-
dents. They are 26 years of age or older,
work full-time or part-time and have
families.

Russ Krebs, 23, has attended CGS for 1
1/2 years, but he did not begin there.
After graduating from high school, Krebs
was on his way — on his way to attend-
ing college full-time and playing football
for Gannon University on a scholarship.
His hopes of being a traditional student
soon began to fade.

Krebs was injured during his freshman
year. Since a football scholarship was no
longer available, Krebs returned home to
Robinson Township and decided to give
Robert Morris College a try.

At Robert Morris, Krebs learned that

college did not offer what he wanted.
Krebs spent one year there and then
decided to take some time off. He attend-
ed the Community College of Allegheny
County (CCAC) and soon after decided
to apply to Pitt.

Krebs said he chose to attend Pitt
because he heard the university offered a
good media communication course.

“It was close. With working full-time, I
could take night classes. Pitt offers night
classes, while some schools do not,”
Krebs said.

Krebs is employed by a video
rental/production company. When asked
if he has any leisure time. he chuckled
and paused for a moment.

“Not really,” he said. “But when I do. I
like to watch movies, raise fish. see
bands play and collect CDS. and I’m an
avid softball player.”

Violence reaches beyond the televison

By Dr. Bob Gallagher
Guest Columnist

Violent assaults against
students are on the increase
on college campuses. When
a particularly nasty assault
occurs, we all feel a twinge
of fear, but since it’s not a
pleasant thing to think
about, we tend to quickly
repress the realities of the
danger around us.

The evidence, however,
suggests that during our life-
time most of us will experi-
ence assault, either against
us or a close friend or rela-
tive. Women are particularly
vulnerable, and it is estimat-
ed that at least one woman
in five will be sexually
assaulted at some time in her
life. »

The most common imme-
diate response to assault is
shock. A kind of psychologi-
cal numbness seems to

_ occur, which probably is the

mind’s initial way of coping
with the trauma. Usually, as
the numbness fades and the
reality of what has happened
sinks in, the victim will
begin to experience a variety
of intense emotional
responses. Anger may take
over for a while, but fre-
quently this is followed by
feelings of anxiety, helpless-
ness, - depression and

extreme vulnerability. The
assault often seems to dam-
age the victim’s self-con-
cept, leaving the person feel-
ing inadequate, frightened
and feeling less in control of
his or her life.

These intense reactions
may last anywhere from a
few weeks to several months
depending on the severity of
the assault and the psycho-
logical make-up of the vic-
tim. Sometimes, however,
the systems may persist for
an unusually long period of
time. They also may reap-
pear later, near the anniver-
sary date of the assault or
because something else
in the person’s life triggers
the emotional reaction.
Nightmares may reoccur,
concentration may be affect-
ed, and a kind of hypervigi-
lance or generalized anxiety
may become pronounced.

Unfortunately, many
assault victims do not like
to talk about their experi-
ences. Sometimes, as is
the case with many rape
victims, unwarranted feel-
ings of shame are experi-
enced, and the victimization
is suffered in silence. Family
and friends, with no under-
standing of what is causing
the moodiness or withdrawal
of the victim, may not be
very supportive, which fur-

ther exacerbates the prob-
lem.

Survivors of assault should
not underestimate the psy-
chological implications of
their experience. It’s impor-
tant for them to share their
experiences with trusted
friends and utilize whatever
healing support they pro-
vide. If the trauma is severe,
or the symptoms long-last-
ing, professional help should
be sought. Counseling, even
of a short-term nature, can
help survivors to recover
their lost self-esteem, to
focus on their natural coping
mechanisms and to reestab-
lish feelings of control in
their lives.

If you know someone who
is experiencing continued
distress following an assault,
you might suggest that the
person call (in the event of a
rape). Pitt’s Sexual Assault
Services (648-7856) or
Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape (hotline number 765-
2371 or 682-0219). For
other types of assault call
the University of Pittsburgh
Counseling Center (648-
7930) or Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (624-
2100).

head of the Counseling
Center.)

to accept the mag stripe cards, according to Sallade-Farina. And
negotiations are being finalized with the Yellow Cab company,
allowing students also to cover cab fare with the new cards.
Both programs are expected to be implemented by the end of the
spring semester.

The new cards will be issued first to students who have a meal
plan or choice dollars. Beginning Jan. 2, the old bar code cards
will no longer be accepted for food purchases.

The Department of Food Services, in conjunction with the
Information Resources Department, will take photos for new
IDs in the Towers lobby beginning Nov. 27, according to Renae
Brinza of the Department of Food Services.

There is a schedule, in order of last names, for times when
students can have their pictures taken. The last day for pictures
is Dec. 15. The cards will be made over the winter break, and
new cards can be picked up by Jan.2.

“The time line isn’t what we would have liked,” admitted
Sallade-Farina, but she is confident that most students won’t
have a problem exchanging IDs.

“It is possible that some students will be left at the end, but
we’ll work with them. [To avoid problems] we encourage stu-
dents to get their pictures taken when scheduled,” she said.

Students must turn in their old IDs before obtaining a new
card. The students who have lost their old cards will have to pay

' a $10 fine. In addition, after the first week of the spring semes-

ter, the old IDs will no longer allow students access to their
dorms.

“We don’t want extra IDs ﬂoating around. The residence hall
stickers have been changed to prevent security problems,” said
Sallade-Farina.

The mag stripe IDs have been in place at Pitt’s Johnstown
campus for over a year and a half, and there have been no major
problems, according to Hertle. Pitt’s satellite campuses at
Greensburg and Bradford are currently implementing a similar
plan. '

ing evening college, Krebs was recently named
director of the First Degree. He writes two month-
ly columns for the newsletter.

Krebs said, “I like Pitt. One reason is because
I’ve never had a night class with more than 50
people in it. I’ve had a few day classes with 400 to
500 people in them. It’s nice when you’re walking
down a street and a teacher from a year ago says,
‘Hey Russ, how are you doing?”’

Krebs’ story is not uncommon. College, once

thought of as a place of higher learning immedié

ately after high school, has a different look these
days. More adults are returning to the classroom
for a variety of reasons.

Loss of employment, families, changes in atti-
tude and a desire for brighter futures are just some

of the reasons why adults are trading in their

leisure time for text books

Pitt is the only school Flinn ever considered
attending.

“I only live 15 minutes away, plus I’m a big fan
of their football team,” Flinn said.

In addition, he has not missed a home game
since 1980. Flinn, like Krebs, also works full time
as a salesperson with a telecommunications com-
pany.

“After graduation I would like to get a job more
in line with my degree. For now, my full-time job
pays the bills,” he said.

Besides working and attending classes, Flinn
covers the university’s football games for the
Panther Sports Journal.

“The last five years, going to football games has
been a job as well as enjoyment,” he said.

- Flinn admits to having little spare time in his
busy schedule. He is both president and secretary

and spending evenings and
weekends attending classes
and studying.

The New York Times ran
an article that appeared
in April of 1994, which
indicated that older students
are returning to school for

 

going back to school to gain
new skills, to advance in the
job market or simply
because they want_to and
feel they may have missed
something when they were
younger. . _

According to a story fea-
in US. News &
World Report in September
1994, “42 percent of the
students are over the age
of 24” (the National Center
for Education Statistics),
and the trend of adults that
are going back to school
is expected to continue at
least until the end of the
decade.

The ‘80s were a time of
crisis. Cutbacks in govern-
ment aid, an uncertain econ-
omy and declining numbers
of high school graduates
forced many schools to rede-
fine their missions.

Pitt is no different, as it
also has seen more adults

liketo read and write more often.

Flinn recommends CGS to those considering
going back to school. He feels Pitt offers a variety
of ways for the nontraditional student to attend
classes.

“I’m also enrolled‘ this semester in an external
studies course, which is even more nontraditional
than CGS,” Flinn said.‘

The number of older students attending college
has been growing for more than a decade and will
continue to grow in the future. Many high school
juniors and seniors do not know what they want to
be when they grow up. The myth that colleges are
populated by students ranging in age from 18 to
22 just isn’t true anymore. It is not uncommon to
find students of all ages attending college.

growing GMAT course. And for

good reason.

We keep our classes small (12
to 15 students) so you‘re
guaranteed plenty of personal
attention. If there's a concept
that you don’t understand, our
teachers will work with you

exams given under actual test-

OPENS NOVEMBER 22m)

Opinions
It can happen to you too

Friday night something worthwhile is happening. Campus
Women's Organization, BiGaLA, University Democrats, Circle K,
Students Against Fascism and other groups are sponsoring the Rally
Against Violence in Benedum Engineering Hall (on Thackeray
Street) at 7 p.m.

The rally is focusing on violence of all kinds and students have, in
this event, a worthy cause they can unify against.

It would be impossible to list all the victims of violence in this
country. Even the names most people do know only represent a
fraction of a percent of the violence that occurs every day. Violence
against women, child abuse, sexual and domestic abuse, rape,
assault and violence against members of different racial groups
combine to shatter millions of lives in America every year. And
something needs to be done about it.

Of course, the O.J. trial wasn’t focused on the issue of domestic’
violence, but that did play a big part in it. The aftermath of the trial
caught the attention of the nation when members of Nicole Brown
Sirnpson’s family hit the air waves to tell people about what hap-
pened in the Simpson home. Just about everyone can remember the
tapes of Nicole’s call to 911. Not even the strongest of us could
ignore the fear in her voice.

But that was way out there in California, right? It doesn’t really
affect us all the way over here in Pittsburgh, right? Wrong.
Remember Jonny Gammage. It isn’t certain what happened the

A night Garnmage died, but a lot of people have accused police ofﬁ—

cers of excessive use of force. The coroner’s inquest jury recom-
mended that the police officers in question be tried for murder; there
has to be something that caused the jury to say that. What is certain
is that a healthy young man is dead without any explanation.

But that’s all the way out there in Brentwood, and it doesn’t affect
us all the way over here in Oakland, right? Wrong. Think about
Kevin Cecil. A man who was escorting a friend home from a bar
was shot in the back by three men he didn’t know, who had no
motive other than wanting to shoot someone, who didn’t care who
they shot, who didn’t care if the victim lived or died. Fortunately,
Kevin Cecil survived his attack, but he will spend the rest of his life
as a quadriplegic due to this random act of violence. -

We are all human, and no one deserves to be treated in the manner
these three and millions of others have. Kevin Cecil is an extraordi-
nary example that no one is immune to violence; it happens even to
the nicest, most innocent, most unsuspecting people. And it happens
right here. It would be nice to believe that we are isolated from
these kind of things. We’re just trying to get through college, not
bothering anyone, right? Wrong. It can happen to you, at any time.

This is why everyone should take advantage of the opportunity
Friday’s rally presents us. No one can claim they don’t support this
cause. If you don’t, you’re out of your mind. It’s not a partisan issue,
so don’t stay home because of your political party. And forget the
apathy: go and do what you can. If you would like more informa-

tion, call Amy or Lesley at 648-4863.

Shut up and vote, you morons!

I am announcing my candi-
dacy now. Write in my name,
your name or Mr. McGoo' for
our president. Do anything
rather than allow certain stu-
dents to say they represent our
APATHETIC selves for their
own self-aggrandizement
when only 12% of us voted.

Today is the day that only
one in 10 of you will stop by
the polls for SGB elections.
WHY? Two weeks ago I acci-
dentally became interested in
what SGB does on this cam-
pus. After all, it is election
time, and I heard that we have
a Student Government Board
here at Pitt. With the bulletin
boards covered with faces
saying, “Vote for me!” I start-
ed asking friends what it is
that SGB does here, and who I
should vote for. Most people
said they wouldn’t “bother” to

vote.

As a recently hatched politi-
cal activist (some will substi-
tute the word “hack”), I have
done some research on the
reasons why people don’t
vote. Here are the “reasons”
that some of you have offered
me:

1) “It’s a Greek thing, and
only Greeks care about it.”

2) “My vote won’t make a
difference one way or anoth-
er.”

3) “SGB doesn’t have any
power any-way, so who
cares?”

4) “ I think there’s gonna be
snow tomorrow.”

Here are my answers for
these pathetic excuses:

1) As one candidate put it
the other night, “Greeks are
only approximately 10% of
this campus’ population.” He
later commented that last year
only 12% of the CAS popula-
tion voted. YOU do the math.
If independents don’t vote,
then we won’t get non-Greek
representation. If you elect
non-Greek board members,

'it’s not “just a Greek thing.”

No matter how you vote, more
than 2% of us need to show.

Patrick
McKelvey

It’s NOT an us vs. them issue;
it’s an issue of you choosing
representation. They are orga-
nized, and we are not, and if
you don’t show for the polls
they will.

2) As for whether or not
your vote counts, see the

~ above answer and think about

this fact: the Allocations

.Committee for your Student

Activities Fee is selected by
SGB after the applicants are
interviewed by the outgoing
SGB president, the incoming
SGB president, the chairper-
son of the outgoing
Allocations Board, the SGB’s
business manager and a senior
member of the outgoing
Allocations Committee. Don’t
you want a say in who decides
how 50% of your Student
Activities Fee gets spent? No?
Then don’t complain about
who gets what money!
Money, you say, what money?
Oh, you know, the $500,000
or so that the Allocations
Committee carves up out of
your Student Activities Fee. If
nothing else, go up to 639
WPU and ask for an applica-
tion to be on the committee.
It’s open to anyone and, what
the hell, it may be an interest-
ing look into how our money
gets spent at our university.

3) As for the “they don’t
have any power anyway”
argument, think about this.
The SGB represents us
whether we vote or not. That
means they represent over $75

‘million worth of “contribu—

tions” to this university
through our tuition. If I were
to cruise into any office on
this campus and say the some-
one, “Hi! I gotta check here
for $75 million. Can you do
me a couple of favors?” I
guarantee that I’d get whatev-
er I wanted from the powers
that be (not to mention a good
feed at the University Club).
That’s what SGB is supposed
to‘ do for us, and it’s up to us

to make sure that they do it.‘

4) As for the snow  vote
on your way out to the slopes
for your day off from classes.
I bet if I bought a round for
everyone who voted, the
turnout would be a hell of a
lot higher than 12% of the stu-
dent body. What, you say, you
don’t drink? How about a free
CD? Food? Money? (Hold on,
these aren’t national elec-
dons)

This is the day to make a
decision and a statement on
campus, but you won’t. As my
friend John says, “Never
underestimate the stupidity of
the student population.” Well,
that seems a tad harsh to me. I
mean, gosh and golly, the stu-
dent body really cares about
what happens on campus and
to their money, right? But you
don’t. Time and again, your
apathy lets the election
process stagnate by giving us
weak, lame excuses as to why
you can’t or won’t vote. Then,
as usual, I spend the rest of
the year listening to the stu-
dent population whine and cry
that they don’t have a voice
here on camps. This campus
at election time represents the
worst kind of Americans: we
want to be spoon fed, and then
we complain about the taste.
Well, here’s my message to
you:

PUT UP OR SHUT UP!!!

If you won’t participate in
the process, don’t cry if you
feel left out! Come out and
vote. If you live on campus,
you don’t have an excuse
now. I have taken care of that!

If you live in South Oakland .

take a five-minute walk up to
campus and vote. Who knows,
you may even get the urge to
go to that geology class
you’ve been cutting for the
past month.

n Monday at 6:00 p.m.
the Pitt men’s soccer
team had an emergency

appointment at Dr. NCAA’s
ofﬁce. The good doctor asked
the Panthers to bend over so he
could administer a rectal exam
with a telephone pole.

To get into the national tour-
nament, Pitt had to pass its
year—end physical. The
Panthers were complaining of

’ dizziness and stomach pain
after ﬁnishing second in the
conference. In the pre-season
polls, the Big East coaches
picked Pitt to finish 10th in the
conference. So Pitt made an
appointment with Dr. Regular
Season.

On its way to ﬁnishing sec-
ond, the team broke the
school’s single-season win
record of 12 by ﬁnishing the
year at 14-6-1. While setting its
new record, Pitt chalked up
seven consecutive victories,
including wins over nationally
ranked St. John’s (No. 8) and
‘Rutgers (No. 4). Last season,
Rutgers was a Final Four team
in the tournament and won the
consolation game to finish
third.

After closing out the regular
season with a 1-0 win over
Georgetown, and after head

.;_  coach Joe Luxbacher was

 “ named Big East Coach of the

Year, the Panthers still com-

plained of dizziness.

I But Dr. Regular Season gave
the Panthers a clean bill of
health. The doctor thought
maybe it was vertigo, but the
tests proved negative. Since an
accurate prognosis couldn’t be
determined, Dr. Regular
Season referred Pitt to Dr..Big
East.

Pitt beat Seton Hall in the
ﬁrst game of the conference
tournament. The score was tied
at one goal apiece at the end of
. , regulation, and the teams
f played through two scoreless
Eovertime periods. It was then

where senior captain J .L.

Swimming slcluglﬂers CMU

Wednesday, November 15, 1995

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

‘Pitt men’s and women’s swim
teams wracked up 174 points
over Carnegie Mellon’s 25 points
at a dual meet yesterday.

The women’s relay team
brought home the first victory,
ﬁnishing three seconds ahead of
two other Pitt teams and the
CMU entry in the 200-meter
relay medley.

Mike Speerschneider delivered
a quick start to the men’s 200
relay medley barely a second
ahead of CMU.

“Our strategy was basically to
go out and win,” freshman Noah
Caplan said. “We never had us
four together in the relay before,
so it was sort of a virgin experi-

ence, but it proved to be effec-

tive.”

J en Slack followed up the suc-
cess with a 14-second lead for a
ﬁrst—place ﬁnish over two other
Pitt swimmers.

“Camegie Mellon is a team on
the move,” coach Marian
Cassidy Keen said.

The next series of races, the 50
free, were drop—dead sprints with
senior Chrissy DiLeonardo lead-
ing two other Pitt racers with her
first win. Caplan earned his first
win in the men’s 50-yard free,
leading the four Pitt entries over
four CMU entries who ﬁnished
ﬁfth through eighth.

Another freshman, Samantha

Chabotar started the 400-yard
individual medley and finished
12 seconds ahead of the second
place ﬁnisher.

Jenny Doran for a few moments

Freshman Mike. Torotici
livened up the races with a close

third race of the day. Torotici
sneaked a look at his opponent as
he pulled towards the ﬁnish to his
second collegiate win. Torotici
also won the 100 butterﬂy.

“I was hurting pretty. bad com-
ing back, because I took it out too
fast. So I just had to ﬁght to ﬁn-
ish,” Tortorici said.

Lindsay Swiderski and Chris

Balke won the 100 backstroke
races for the women and the
men, respectively. Jenny Banks
and Brian Kotkiewicz followed
up with wins in the 100 freestyle.

Freshmen Brett Collins and
Aimee Crombie won the 500
freestyle.

Jill Fletcher and Jeff Vanders
earned the fastest times in the
100 breaststroke. To end the
meet, both relay teams brought
home the final victories in the
200 freestyle race.

The CMU meet was a great
follow up to Pitt’s second-place
fmish at last weekend’s Division
I Rutgers Invitational.

“The women did a tremendous
job,” Fletcher said. A seven-hour
bus trip that began at 7:00 a.m.
the day of the event didn’t slow

the swimmers.

Fletcher was on ﬁre throughout
the two-day meet, finishing ﬁrst
in the 200 breaststroke, 200 indi-
vidual medley and 100 breast-
stroke;_‘second in the 100
freestyle; and third in the 50
freestyle. The points Fletcher
earned with her win were rein-
forced by Erin Bissel’s third-
place finish in the 200 breast-
stroke.

“Many women swam back-to-
back [events],” Fletcher said,
“which means you have five
minutes to get ready.”

Other top finishers included

sophomores Lauren Dale (second

Hockey beats Allegheny 7-3

By Connie Nigro
Staff Writer

It was 3:30 Saturday afternoon, two
hours before the Pitt hockey team took
the ice against Allegheny, when goalie
Jeff Haduch received a phone call from
Matt White, one of the team captains.

White was calling to inform Haduch
that he would be starting the game in
two hours. Without prior notice, Haduch
was expected to be ready to go, and he
was.

Haduch helped lead Pitt to a 7-3 victo-
ry over the Gators by posting an impres-
sive 27 saves. Haduch came up big
when necessary.

“Haduch made three saves right in a
row, which is hard to do,” White said
referring to when Haduch saved a series
of three consecutive shots securing Pitt’s
victory.

The Pitt hockey team, last year’s
champs,iare in their 25th season and off
to a 2-1 start. They are 2-0 in division
play. The Panthers suffered an 8-2 loss
to Penn State after defeating
Westminster 14-1 in their season opener.

“Penn State was very quick,” White
said. “They scored goals when our
defensemen got caught pinching.”

It didn’t take long for Pitt to regain the
winning edge against a physical
Allegheny team.

Three minutes and 44 seconds into the
game, Bill Elliott scored to give Pitt a 1-
0 lead.

Elliott then went on to score two more
goals for the hat trick and added a fourth
goal late in the second period. Elliott’s
third goal came during a scramble in
front of the Allegheny net. There was a
rebound from the initial shot, and Elliott
was there to poke the puck into the net.

“Billy’s goals are always impressive.
He’s a top offensive guy,” White said.
“He has a good line.”

Pitt’s offensive attack was helped by
the six penalties Allegheny accumulat-
ed. But it wasn’t shocking for Allegheny
to be penalized six times.

“Allegheny is very liberal with their
penalties,” White said.

Pitt took advantage of having the extra

man during the power plays. It clicked
at 50 percent, as the Panthers went three
for six.

Although Elliott scored more than half
of Pitt’s goals, White said it was a team
effort.

“The cool thing is everybody can
score,” White said.

If everybody didn’t score against the
Gators, at least they got a shot off. Pitt
outshot Allegheny 37-30. But it wasn't
the offense alone that led Pitt to victory.
The defense and Haduch, replacing the
injured Patrick Kenny, played a solid
game. Despite the last-minute notice of
his start, Haduch was successful.

“Goaltending isalways a key part in
winning the season, and we have two
good ones,” White said.

Crew roces
indoors for

Co rDu victory

By Nichole Gantshar
Smﬁ Writer

Pitt crew has won every CarDu Pitt
rivalry match except one. Last Saturday
continued Pitt’s domination over
Carnegie Mellon and Duquesne’s teams,
but there was one large difference. The
match was held indoors.

“We were really disappointed we could
not go on the water,” said Dana Jaros, the
women’s novice coach. “We were ready
to have some speed on the water.”

CarDu Pitt is an annual event for the
crew novice teams that marks the end of
the outdoor rowing season. Pitt’s crew
will not row outside again until races
held during spring break in Florida.

Heavy winds prompted the move
inside. Pitt coach Todd Rideneour argued
against the indoor competition but lost
the vote to the two other coaches. The
winds were not much stronger than the
ones the crew had fought at the Head of
the Ohio, but the Duquesne and Carnegie
Mellon coaches voted on the side of cau-
tion.

All fall the novice teams trained in the
afternoons, but the week before the race
they trained in the same manner as the

third—place ﬁnishes, freshman Irene Stergios
exhibited her power in the 200 butterfly
(2210.04), and Megan McNallen proved her
worth in the gruelling 1650 freestyle
(l7:37.38).

Diving successes also enhanced the num-
ber of team points earned by the swimmers.
Sunday Lewandowski won two ﬁrst-place
finishes" with 385.60 on the 1-meter and
444.00 on the three—meter.

“It was apparent that there wasn’t a great
deal of competition for her,” diving coach
Julian Krug said; “That makes it more difﬁ—
cult to focus.”

Amy Spinwebber ﬁnished third out of 25
competitors and took fifth on the one— meter
platform. I

A concussion, sustained the week before
the invitational, prevented Courtney Sunseri
from training, so Krug limited her participa-
tion to the one-meter event

“I was real pleased with the way we swam
at Rutgers,” coach Marian Cassidy Kean
said. “It was aninteresting invitational for us
to go to. We’ve never been to one of that
kind for a two—day meet with six different
teams.”

Many swimmers challenged or earned
their personal bests. Chabotar’s\included

wins in the 1650 freestyle (16:54:62), 400 '
individual medley (4:31.47) and a tliird—

place ﬁnish in both the 200 and 500 freestyle
races. ‘

In 500 freestyle and the 400 individual
medley, Jennifer Slack finished “very close
to lifetime best times,” Keen said.

Melissa Burns also set personal records
with a fifth-place finish in the 200 freestyle
and a strong anchor in the 400 freestyle relay.

At the invitational, the men won by 53
points.

Pitt put up its first points in the 50

freestyle, with Eric Stefanski placing third
(21.40), Bob Nooning fourth (21.51) and
Senior Eric Stull ﬁfth (21.60).

In the 100 butterﬂy Jon Haggerty came in
first and set a new meet record with a time of
50.88.

“Jon’s time is probably a top 25 time in
Division I swimming at this point in the sea-
son,” Knoles said.

Stefanski and Sami Vartiainen placed sec-
ond and third in the 200 freestyle with times
of 1:42.11 and 1:43.42 respectively.

In the 200 breaststroke, Chris Perry placed
second with a 2:10.67, and Pete Hezky
placed ﬁfth with a 2: 12.63.

Adam Kotkiewicz broke a meet record in
the 200 individual medley with a 1:53.58.
Pitt also placed fourth and ﬁfth with Chris
Perry (l:55.6l) and Jon Haggerty (1257.47).
This was the highest scoring individual event
for Pitt.

Hezky and Kotkiewicz placed third and
ﬁfth in the 400 individual medley with times
of 4:04.68 and 4:08.84.

In the 100 free, Stefanski added to his pre-
vious second and third places withanother
top—thiee ﬁnish at a 46.02.

Haggerty continued his excellence in the
200 butterﬂy with a second (l:54.31)._

Pitt cleaned up in the 200 backstroke
with Kotkiewicz second (1:51.82), Stefanski
third (1252.32) and Haggerty fifth (1:57.75).

In the final individual event, Preston
Hammontree came in ﬁfth in the 1650 free
with a 16:22.33.

In the relay events, Pitt took ﬁrst in the 400
free (3:05.40, meet record), second in the
400 medley (3:29.43) and second in the 800
free (6:58.94).

John Soulakis took first and set meet
records in the one and three—meter diving
events, and Jeremy McClean ﬁnished third
in both events.

varsity team — arriving for practice at the
boathouse at 5:00 a.m. Angry at the move
indoors, the crew still kept its focus.

“I told them this was still important,”
Jaros said. The novice crews delivered. In
a race run as a relay on ergometers, the
novice women’s eight finished first, and
the novice women’s four placed second.

“They really came through on the ergs,”
Jaros said. The crew normally trained on
the ergometers, an indoor rowing machine
that uses a handle with a chain instead of
the boat oars. ‘

The novice men’s four team work also
earned a second place ﬁnish, but the men’s
eight didn’t place.

“The chain snapped, and the handle
came off during the relay,” club president
Julie Lambrou said. So the race was not
counted towards the total number of team
points.

Once the team totals were announced,
the Pitt novice crew exploded in a series of
cheers they‘ had prepared to shout on the
riverfront.

Some of the other schools started to
leave, but the race organizers held several
more races to compensate for being
indoors. Pitt also won a Coxswain race.
The Coxswain usually sit motionless in a
four or eight boat and shout commands
that control the rowers’ rhythm and direc-
tion. The coxswain race gave the novice
rowers their opportunity to yell at their
cox. The coxs could hardly be seen as they
raced.

“Usually the cox is yelling at them,”
Lambrou said. Dozens of screaming
novice rowers surrounded each erg and
shouted encouragement at the cox.

It was surreal ending to an even odder
day.

Last-minute goalie decisions
were not the only occurrences
that came down to the wire.

Ironically enough, the game
itself was almost forfeited by
Allegheny because they had no
insurance and therefore
couldn’t get referees.

White managed to get a ref-

eree so the game could be

played. However, there are
usually two refs in a game, and
this game only had one.

Despite a lack of a second
referee, uncalled penalties
were not a problem.

“He called a better game
alone than if there were two of
them,” White said. “He’s one
of the best officials. He knows
the game inside and out.”

After the final seconds of_
regulation and the traditional
hand shake, the ice had cleared
except for a victorious, yet
exhausted Pitt hockey team.

At the insistence of their
coach, Dick Rizzo, Pitt players
were on the ice doing line
sprints. This scene appeared a
little odd because sprints
seemed more of a punishment
than a reward.

Coach Rizzo assured his
players he had their best inter-
est in mind when he yelled to
them from the bench, “I’m not
doing this as a punishment.
I’m doing this because I love
you.” I

Pitt will face off against

pened and the Panthers started
to feel a little pain in their stom-
achs to go along with the dizzi-
ness. They had made it to the
Big East Soccer Championship
ﬁnal for the ﬁrst time in school
history.

A win over St. John’s in the
ﬁnal would secure Pitt an auto-
matic bid to the national touma-
ment. But alas, the Red Storm’s
attack was too much for goalie
Adam Spitzer and the Pitt

‘ defense, as St. John’s won 2-0.

Dr. Big East checked out the
Panthers’ ailments, but he too
was unable to make an accurate
prognosis. (After the loss to St.
John’s, the stomach pain was
almost unbearable. Dr. Big East
thought it was just anxiety
because Pitt had to wait for an
at-large bid to make the nation-
al toumament. .

The doctor just prescribed
rest, because the Panthers ﬁn-
ished at No. 2 in the
Intercollegiate Soccer Athletic
Association’s Mid Atlantic
Region. And the top two teams
in the region always make it to
the tourney. Pitt even ﬁnished
ranked No. 22 in the country.
Surely that was enough to qual-
ify for the 32-team ﬁeld, espe-
cially with 16 at-large bids
available.

But from Sunday night to

' Monday afternoon, the pain

became unbearable, so the
Panthers got an emergency
appointment with Dr. NCAA
for Monday night. It was the
same time the ﬁeld was

announced for the national tour-
nament.

Little did Pitt know that Dr.
NCAA was old, nearly blind,
senile and accepted bribes. The
doctor prescribed a rectal exam
when the only thing needed was
a shot of champagne to cele-
brate making it to the touma-
ment. '

Pitt got the news while at the

' doctor’s ofﬁce, the same time it

was bending over for Dr.
NCAA. St. John’s was the only
Big East team to make it to the
national tournament. Pitt didn’t
make it.

It didn’t matter that the
Panthers beat two credible
teams thatmade last year’s
national tournament. Along
with Rutgers, Pitt beat another
conference newcomer, Notre
Dame, 3-0. The Panthers‘ ﬁnal
record of 14-6-1 didn’t matter
much either.

Pitt was one of three teams
ranked in the ISAA Top 25
which didn’t make the touma-
ment. No. 20 Towson State and
Fresno State, which was tied for
25th, were the other two.

Maryland, ranked No. 23, got
an at-large bid with a 12-6-1
record. During the regular sea-
son the Terps were shut out by
both Rutgers and Seton Hall by
scores of 2-0. Pitt had a 3-1
record over those two teams.

Princeton (13-4) was ranked
No. 3 in the Mid Atlantic

‘Region, but got a bid over the

second-rankedPanthers. Like
Maryland, Princeton also lost to
its only Big East opponent,

Head coach Joe Luxbacher talks strategy with captain J.L. Gorsin. Luxbacher was named
Big East Coach of the Year after guiding the Panthers to a 14-6-1 record.

Seton Hall.

The NCAA Selection
Committee cited Pitt’s weak
out—of-conference schedule as
one reason it wasn’t selected.
That’s funny — the Panthers
played Robert Morris, which is
ranked No. 4 in the Mid

Atlantic (Pitt’s 8-3 conference
record mustn’t have meant that
much).
The committee also said that
Princeton was recommended
over Pitt by the chairman of the
region. He is Barry Gorman,
head coach of the Penn State

Nittany Lions’ soccer team.
From now until next fall, the
Panther soccer team has to walk
bowlegged, and it has good ole

Dr. NCAA to thank.
