AS HOSTESS AI-

 

Dean Amos was hostess at a. din-_
ner and dance‘ held, in the iHe.inz
House last Thursday evening for all
the Senior girls. The dinner, begin-
ning at six o'clock, was attended by
more than -100 girls, almost 100 per
cent. of the“ class enrollment. There
were ﬁve hostesses assisting Dean
Amos at the different tables, Mrs. G.
H. Reavis, Mrs. A. B. Wright, Mrs.
L, O. Lohstetter, Mrs. C. A. Buckner
and Dorothy Stewart.

Dean Amos welcomed all the girls
and said she hoped they would all
learn to know each other better dur-
ing the coming’*seme'-ster and form
more lasting friendships. She then
turned the achair over to Mary Chap-
man, president of the class, who pre-
sented a bouquet of roses to Miss
Amos as a token of appreciation
from the class. She then called on
various girls» representing, the differ-
ent schools on the campus, College,
Education, Economics, Medicine, Law,
Pharmacy and Dentistry. These girls-
expre-ssedl the feelings of the whole
class in tlian-king Dean Amos for her
.inspiration and help during the three
and a half years of their stay at Pitt,
and in particular for her eﬁorts in
getting all the Senior girls together
"for this occasion. A resolution was
maide to follow up this ﬁrst Senior
Night with many other affairs and
give all the girls of the class an op-
portunity of knowing each other bet-
ter. The dinner ended with the
singing of the‘ Pitt songs. _ _

Dancing featured -the remainder of
the evening and lasted until 11:30
o'clock. The music was furnished
by John ,Pol1ock"s Orchestra. The
grand march was led by Mary Chap-
man. and Frank R. Williams. The

When the University football team .played Stanford at Palo Alto, Calif.,

 

December 30, one ofvthe loyal Pitt rootersv present was Dr. J. V. McAlpi-n,
Dent. ’O4, Lieutenant Commander, located at the San Francisco Naval Tram-
ing Station. Through the efforts of this loyal grad, Pitt had a “Gob” band

of-about 60 pieces tooting for it at the

game. Before the game and between

rched around the-field carrying a‘ prominent Pittsburgh

M. W. Scanlon,‘ Ex. Col. '20, who was also instrumental in boosting Pitt

activities around the time of the game

at Frisco, had a picture taken of some

of the “gobs” holding the banner with -Dr. McAlpin in the background. He

is the chap second from the left with the pleasant smile on his face.

PIIEMS BY ALLEN, '15  

The Literary Review of the New
York Evening Post. of ‘January 13,
contains the following review by Hen-
'ry'Seide1 _Cail~by of'“Carolina Chan-

by Du Bose‘ Heyward and Hervey Al-*
len, B.‘ s.  the book being
published b‘y\‘th‘e Macmillan Company
of New York: .

This‘ is a. book which well may
set a fashion, and a good one. It is
an -attempt, and a suocessfu-1 at-tempt,
to catch in verse the haunting mem-
ories and rich atmosphere of Charles-
ton and_ its'_tl‘.ibutal‘y South. The
thing has been donein prose again
and again for American localities, and
we called it local color; but prose
is not ﬂexible enough to wind about
the heart of an old town. All man-
nor of e»xpressi'c-n is necessar-y, and
here we have it-—lyric, narrative, ele- 1‘
giac, descriptive. It has =been.done_.
of course, in verse for New England,
but not, if memory holds, in a sin-
ble book, who-so avowed purpose is
to evoke an image of history,,and en-.
vironment. ' "“ p

The two .autl_>ol‘s run in yoke suc-
cessfully. .. Mr. Allen has the more
skilful ‘pen, especially on the’ ballad,
although Mr. Heywarrl’s .“The- Pi-
rates’‘’ is a very ﬁne 'n.arrativ'e-poem,
one of the best in the ‘book. lVIl1"(:h,
is to be said for collaboration in
such a work as this. The differing
styles and -the different ‘nuances’ of
‘each point of- view not only give va-
riety; ‘
crease inlclu._sivene'ss. "Such a, poem.
as “Marsh Tackles,” of the little
wild horses of the seaislands, or the

ed before, the end of this week. These
reports may be made in person for. by
mail at room 210, Alumni Hall.
