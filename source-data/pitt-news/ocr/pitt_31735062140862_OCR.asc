Dr. William Swanson, associate
professor of histology and bacteri-

can now successfully handle ﬁfty

includes sixteen beds and \a staff of
‘ over ﬁfty nurses, nurses’ aides doc-
-tors, and canteen operators.
A registration sheet for those
“ enrolled in the undergraduate
‘schools will be placed on the
’ ground floor of the Cathedal. Two
hundred students are expected to

register for donations on April
28, the only day not ﬁlled.

Donors under twenty-one years
of age must have their registration
cards signed by‘ their fathers;
mother’s signature will not do.

.Originally, the mobile organiza-

for four days, but with the increas-

found unnecessary. Consequently,
the unit will move from the Cathe-

T. R. YBARRA
Int rviewed Hitler

Although it sounds like an item
from Ripley, this doesn't happen
to be one of the “nots"—A news-

papervnan has actually interview-
ed 'tl1tler——not only once, but twice.

Mr. T. R. Ybarra, the newspaper-
man, will visit the University this
Friday to address the Conference
on Inter-American Affairs. He has
spent 25 ‘years as foreign corre-
spondent in Europe and Latin
America.

After his ﬁrst interview with
the Fuehrer, Mr. Ybarra labeled
his as “unimpressive,” but after
the second one he described him
as a “revivalist preacher.”

Ybarra ﬁrst"met Hitler in the
famous “Brown House” of Munich
before his rise to power. Then he

olyn Miller, C44, chairman. Guests
are from Edgewood, Mt. Lebanon.
Dormont, Bellevue, Carrick, and
Aspinwall high schools. Ten seniors
from each of these schools have
been invited. Seventy-ﬁve Pitt girls
will serve as hostesses and. the
group will be taken on a tour of
the University. Mrs. Duffus, in-
structor in English and Dr. A. Jami-
son, director of the Women’s

you'd notice on the street.” In de-
scribing his second interview in the‘
Chancellery in Berlin, Mr. Ybarra
said:

“When he started to talk he
became a changed man—tense,
voluble, not unlike a revivalist
preacher. Hitler’s eyes are those
of a fanatic. They have a bum-
ing, zealous light. I can under-
sand the spell his oratory casts
over a Nazi audience. But there
was nothing to suggest he might
some day conquer most of Eu-

rope.” _
Mr. Ybarra also interviewed
Mussolini whom he considered

much more impressive. ‘

He comes to Pittsburgh, how-

ever, to talk about Latin America,
having obtained information when
he went there as a correspondent
in 1938.

Mr. Ybarra’s mother was an

American and a descendant of _

Miles Standish; his father was ‘a.
general in the Venezuelan Army
and was Governor of Caracas and
of six Venezuelan states. Much of
his life there is told in his auto-.
biography. “Young Man of Car-
acas,” ‘which is a Book of the
Month Club selection.

He will address a conference
luncheon on Friday at 12.30 o’clock
in Hotel Schenley on the subject

“America Faces South,” which is .

the title of one of his ﬁve books;
Mr. Ybarra will also speak at a pub-.
lic meeting in the evening at Fos-

Pitt will play host to a three—day conference on Inter-
mmerican affairs starting Thursday of this week.

. Purpose of the conference will be a deeper understanding
of our Latin—Americanneighbors. Movies will be shown de-
picting the southern countries, and talks will be given on
certain phases of South American life by such noted author-
ities as Sa.muel Guy Inman, and T. R. Ybara.

Especially during the present times, our understanding‘
of South America should be intelligent and sincere. Too often
in the past, differences have arisen which could have been
easily avoided by a more complete knowledge of the situa-

tions.

Questions like Argentine beef and Chilean nitrates
are, of course, political questions to be decided by our na-
tional government. However, although our national gov-
ernment must needs regulate our foreign relations, the citi-
zens of the United States should-realize the conditions and
problems of our Latin neighbors. ‘

Too often, we have been referred to as the “Colossus
of the North,” an appellation acquired largely through our
past mistaken dealings with the southern countries. Ameri-
can ﬁnanciers neglected the feelings and methods of the
'_ routllzerners in many of their dealings-——with complicated
. resu s. -

Now, with organizations such as the International Confer-

’-ence of~Ameri'can States, and

because of work done by the

Rockefeller Foundation, differences have to a great degree

been ironed out.

»_College students will bear the brunt of inter-American
and international relations in the future. They will consti-
tute the future diplomats and statesmen. Therefore it is

Conferences such as the

’ - ﬁtting that they become familiar with these countries with
which they will have to deal. '

one scheduled for this week

help these students ‘in their understanding. Friendly rela-
tions shouldbe cemented between the countries in the West-
ern.Hemisphere and an integrated knowledge in American
students will help to bring them about.

Congratulations to Ruth Plough-
ton and Jack Shields on their re-
cent marriage April 2 in Washing-
ton, D. C. Right now they are the
epitome of happiness. (Just notice
them!)

Pat Bennett has ﬂung a;-:i<lc all
his other ﬂame:-:—-the latest rumor
is that he has married attractive
Rosita Reich and neither one seems
to deny the rumor. What a shame
you have to leave for the army so
.-oon Pat.

The latest object of Jack St-eryt-
ler’s affections is cute litt.le_,:l."re~:<h-
man Martha Carmen.

Last '1‘uesda.y Lorna l-lazelton
caused quite a sensation among the

Pjlfpourrj . . .

feminine circles of the Tuck Shop
when she brought her ensign friend
down. Most of the girls had trouble
controlling their desire to meetihim.

Walt West made one of his infre-
quent appearances in Pitt society at
the fre;-:hman dance with striking
Ginger Morris.

That attractive freshman Betty
Gilleland has turned out to be one
of Pitt‘s celebrated co-eds. And fel-
lows you should see her date book.

“Flight C, to your planes!” To
the rapid cadence of idling motors,
Mr. Wainwright races towards a
row of sleek yellow monoplanes lin-
ed up race horse fashion‘ on the
Butler tarmac. Vaguely he won-
ders whet-herthe ship is airworthy
(that term came out of the C~.A.R.
book)..To tell the truth, it doesn’t
look so good. And that funny look-
ing gent inthe ‘front seat of the
cabin~—_where did they _.get him?
Oh well, the war effort cannot be
held up. -

With a lump as big as aﬁ apple

in his throat, the . regretful
- groundling climbs in behind his
- instructor and fastens a very
- anemic looking safety belt across
his thighs. A parachute is strap-
ped to his back, but its presence
is more than a little disturbing
to theworried. egglet. With a
roar the monopjane starts down
the runway. Now .Wainwrigh‘t is
wide-eyed‘with unce inty and
awe. The hangars the by and
soon the trees and buildings are
mere. specks as the cub. climbs

' steadily into the blue.

”‘“"l

The instructor
through the Gasport:

remarks idly
“A little

rough. today.” Wainwright nods to

no one in particular in silent agree-
ment. Alright, you take over.”
(“I guess he means me” is Wain-
wright’s brilliant reaction.) The
budding ﬂyer grasps the stick in his
hands and waits. (It’s still ﬂying-
this can’t’ be so tough.) “Keep that
nose up.” (Up where?) "Keep it
on the horizon.” (0h.) (“Make a
90 degree turn to the left~—-Not so
steep’ on that bank.” (That ground
looks like a big carpet now.)

”Follow the railroad.” (This is
ﬁne-—bring on those Japs.) “Keep
that nose up, you just lost 500
feet of altitude.” (Is that bad?)
Wainwright feels for the ripcord
on his parachute. “Climb to 1500
feet.” (I should have stayed in bed,
I guess.) .“Climb, climb, this ship
won’t bite you.” (Well, that’s re-
assuring‘ anyway.) “Keep-~ those
wings level.” (What’s the matter
with this crate?—lt won’t stay.
put.) “Take your hands off those
controls.” (Oh, now that’s going
too far!) “Go ahead, don’t' be
afraid; it can ﬂy better than you
can.” (That had all the earmarks
of an insult—alright, so we crash—-
-my insurance is paid.)

,Wainw1-ight releases the controls
and puts his ﬁngers in his ears. To
his amazement the tub ﬂies steadi-
-ly onward, with never. a deviation
from --its course. In that instant,
Wainwright is transformed. His
grasp is surer on the stick, and his
eyes are keener. Perhaps the in-
structor smiles a little now’, for
the hardest part of his job is over

‘---—the' senseless fear has ﬂed. Down

glides the plane like a great bird
and settles on the runway. Anoth-

Harry Clark, Ivan Frey, Mike

The 1943 football team has serv-

and Walt Cummins -are among the
contributions of the footballteam.
Frank Mattioli, another footballer-

ineligible. Nisely and Salvucci are
out for the weights. Cummins is

trying for ‘a position on the sprint

He left school after his sopho-

he was called up by, the Reds.

“He has a good fast ball, a good

0 1: week we got around to com-

 the good old dances given at
in the late twenties and early
pies and the recent wartime af-
s, with. Dr. John Ferguson of

economics department. The

9.} Professor has observed many
Pitt dance and the changes which
as seen from year to year have
most interesting.
 Ferguson recalls with fond
_,embrance the Junior Proms of
e, late twenties when the tariff
as approximately eight dollars
dvjthe girls came in knee length
als wearing the familiar tight
dbands around‘ short, clipped
The tone of the dances re-
‘ted the post-war years, gay and
little boisterous. 1'
‘With the depression. a pall fell
er dancing just as it did over
erything ‘else. “Dances,” says Dr.
guson,'“were quieter, less elab-
Miss and; the students who attend-
[hem had a more serious air.”
ese were the days of the shag
the big apple, of small orches-
and “hard-time” dances.

1936 and 1937, when economic
ditions began to pick up, Pitt

dances took on a more lively turn.
There was less formality and less
stiffness and everyone had a good
time. Pitt students were quieter,

,more reﬁned. “They were, and are,

a swell group of‘ kids,” said the
Doctor.

In discussing the many orches-
tras that have, at one time or an-
other, played at an Pitt dance, Dr.
Ferguson stated his preference for
Henry King and his violins as
ranking ﬁrst among his choice of
good dance bands. (We take it the
good Doctor prefers sweet music).
Professor Ferguson was willing to
put Jan Savittl next on his list but
did not want to go any further,
adding, that he liked them all.

In talking about dance music, Dr.
Ferguson paused to reminisce on
the many types of dancing he has
seen at a large Pitt affair. He is
convinced that the dances have‘in-
creased in number and that they

have become more varied in style,

being, as he put it, “just a little too
complicated for him." ' .
With ‘ wartime restrictions social
affairs have necessarily been cur-
tailed. Today, said Dr. Ferguson,
the dancers are younger than ever

now in the army, many others are
too occupied with war work to give
much time to social affairs. Today,
too, one no longer sees the familiar
faces of the alumni who returned
to the scenes of student days. How-
ever, the number of people at the
recent Freshman dance is ample
proof, that Pitt students can still
laugh and enjoy themselves in war-
time and that Pitt dances continue
to be an important feature of stu-

ﬁfth semi-annual meeting of the
Store Operations clinic last Wed-
nesday and Thursday.

Formerly called the Complaint-
Prevention clinic, this meeting has
expanded its scope in order to dis-
cuss department store problems
brought about by the War.

Three main topics discussed were
Manpower, Work Simpliciﬁcation,
and Effect of Rationing on Retail
Stores. The latter subject was tied
up with -the.» ﬁrst two since the
shortage of manpower has brought

‘about a need for work. simpliﬁca-

tion, yet rationing has caused a
greater need for manpower due to
its complexity.

Speakers at the dinner meeting-

in the Faculty Club on Wednes-
day, were Mr. Robert Overall,‘
comptroller of Gimbel Brothers,
whose topic was “Government Reg-
ulation—It’s Effect on Retail
Stores,” and Mr. G. Alfred Palmer,
personnel director of ‘Joseph

Pitt’s\Women Graduates

Are Wanted

by WAVES

Pitt women graduating this spring have an opportunity
to be of real service in the war effort by enlisting “in th
WAVES. The WAVES is an organization of women whos
job is to replace Navy men at 'shore stations. As a membe

of the WAVE’s you may wear the
same navy blue, win the same rat-
ings and earn the same pay as the
boys whom you relieve for duty on
the ﬁghting fronts.

No matter what you majored in
while at Pitt, there is an impor-
tant position waiting for; you in
the WAVES. Even if you have no
special skill or experience you‘ may

‘receive valuable training in the

WAVES. ,

After being sworn into active
duty as a WAVE you will go.
ﬁrst, at government expense, to
one of the training schools. Fol-
lowing attaining period of four
months, you will be equipped to
report for active duty.

If you are a citizen of the Unit-
ed States, are between 20 and 36
and are in good'physical condition,
you should be eligible for WAVE
enlistment.

Further information about the
WAVES may be obtained at the

oﬂice of Naval Procurement, Key- 1

stone Hotel, downtown.

Graduate Chem

Rules Modified  
Because of war conditions, regu-

lations for graduate study with a

major in chemistry have been mod-
iﬁed.

Comprehensive examinations for

2

the Ph. D. degree are waived for ’

theduration because of the heavy
demands which have been made at
the time of ‘graduation on students
and faculty.

Preliminary examinations will be or

required as usual. These will con-
stitute the required comprehensive
examinations for the M.S. degree.
Graduate students shall not be per-
mitted to continue research toward
the Ph.D. degree until the pre-
liminary examination is met.

Another modiﬁcation states that

-- German is the only required for-

eign language and an examination
must be passed one year after the
successful completion of the pre-
liminary exam. These modiﬁcations
go into effect immediately.
