Alternative Transportation '

Fair shows city residents

how to get around greenly ’

by Elizabeth Williamson

Staﬂ Writer

A ‘bike is more than a
mode of transportation for
senior Steve Kurpiewski. It_’s
a source of freedom.

“I’m not limited by any-'

thing because I have abike,”
Kurpiewski, who has been
using‘ a bike as his main
mode of transportation for
four years, said.

Kurpiewski can travel the
entire city, using the rack on
his bike to hold up two cases
of beer, without paying for

parking or gas, waiting for

the bus or getting caught in
traffic. .

Many. student bikers like

Kurpiewski gathered at

Schenley Plaza on Friday

for the Alternative, Trans-
portation Festival, which

took place at three locations

throughout Pittsburgh.

Nathaniel ‘Doyno, of Steel '

City Biofuels, Inc., coordi-

nated ‘the events, which fea-

tured live music and circus

' performances.

The goal of the event

was to bring awareness to.

the problems that the city
and country’ face concerning
transportation. V

“We have "to get away
from dependence on foreign

oil,” Doyno said. “And we"

have to take care of the envi-
ronment.” ; .
Doyno proposed a chal-
lenge for Pittsburgh: Build
a city with a transportation
system that is cheap, easy
for students to use and ben-
eficial for the environment.
“Biking is perfect for stu-
dents because it is efficient

Gerber estimated the cost

be about $200. A basic used
bike costs between $100 to

$200-plus repairs. On the‘

other hand, the price ofa
new bike "begins at -$300
and could climb as high as

$10,000..

lain, especially when he announced that
Iran was completely free of homosexu-
als. -
Morrison added that speeches like Ah-
madinejad’s at Columbia unmask bullies
for who they really are. Such speeches
demonstrate that fundamentalism, ha-
tred and bigotry do exist in individuals
like the Iranian president, she said.

The discussion at Columbia was im-
portant, Morrison said, because it showed
the public the extent of Ahmadinejad’s
fanaticism. By not allowing Ahmadine-
jad to speak, there is no way to challenge
such hatred and bigotry.

Cormack, of Oxford University, said
that there are other ways to show that
Ahmadinejad is a bad man — anyone
can put a video of him on YouTube; not
everyone is invited to speak at an Ivy
League university.

Just augmented his teammate’s argu-
ment. -

“We cannot give Ahmadinejad a fo-
rum in the U.S. while he represses free
speech back home...” Just said. “Why
should we give Ahmadinejad credibility
by allowing him to speak?”

Cormack said he believed that the
speech did more harm than good. Bol-
linger’s attacks only allowed Ahmadine-
jad to play the victim and gave him fuel
to lash out against America, he said.

“He knew he was going to be criti-
cized,” Cormack said. “This gives him

‘further traction with those who support

5,

him. .
A The speech at Columbia, covered on
every global news network, gave Ah-
madinejad public prestige. -He can say
thatehe spokewith U.S. scholars and on

-their terms, Just added.

  Sen. Craig does not

The nonprofit Idaho Hall
of ‘Fame Association claims,
on its website, to be dedicated
to saluting the best of Idaho’s
best, the cream of the Idahoan
potato crop, if you will.‘

These people are “Idahoans '
onloan to the wor-ld,” the as— ,

sociation proudly proclaims,
“men and women of Idaho
[who] have made an impact on
their communities, their state,
the nation and in many cases,
the world.”

That’s why the Idaho Hall
of Fame Association’s decision
to induct Republican Sen. Lar-
ry Craig almost makes sense.
The senator. made an “impact”
on his state and nation, to be
sure — it’s just that the impact
wasn’t exactly a positive one.‘

Right now, the senator’s»

publicized, arrest and guilty
plea to disorderly conduct in
an airport bathroom sex sting
is probably whathe is famous

for. He is currently, and most

likely will continue to be. for
some time, most recognized
for soliciting sex _in a men’s
bathroom. _

“At the time it .[the induc-

.,tion] was considered, this oth-
- er matter had not come up,”

Well, wnhetheri the Idaho

his “3O yearsi ‘of exemplary.

The only thing is, Craig’s
service was anything but “ex-
emplary.” ‘One of the most
prominent aspects‘ of the sena-

‘ tor’s ‘career was limiting the

rights of homosexuals.

Calumrziat ‘

1 think I’m a littlebit ad_-
dicted to “Guitar Hero.”

For the uninitiated, ‘—‘Guitar

Hero” is a video game where

' you play along to the guitar

‘parts of ‘lots of different fa-
.1nous'rock songs." ' V ’ '
_ You have ‘a controller,
shaped more or less like agili-
-tar that has ﬁve colored but-

tons. on the neck, and a “strum V
.‘bar’.’ that you have to hit to

Strum and that’s pretty much

j of skill and’ coordination. It’s

not a game that you become
skilled at. overnight, in other-
words. What guitar hero does
best, and is becoming the goal
of other games, is changing

video games from a solitary,

‘nerdy’ activity" to ‘a form of

- socializing with other people.

how you play. And it’s "awe— _

some. I A

I don’t say this lightly be-
cause I’m a_ big game player.
But “Guitar Hero” isn’t just
a regular video game where
yousit in_ front of the TV like
a ﬁsh and mash buttons to‘ do
whatever it is you want to do.
‘Instead, it requires a good deal

Think about it: how many ~

video games today include
some sort of multiplayer op-~
tion ”or- online play? I’d be
willing to say nearly all of
them, and almost all the best-»
selling games of the past sev-
eral years have ‘had some form
of multiplayer ability. I
Games like “Guitar Hero”
take this aspect to another lev-
el because instead of making
the game about strategy or in-
game knowledge, it provides
one of the most stripped-'

'down and simplistic experi-

ences you can have. And, to
reiterate, it’s awesome. So

instead of cutting a bunch of

‘non-gamers out of the loop

with steep learning curves and
weird game mechanics, it’s
inherently inclusive.

But “Guitar Hero” isn’t the
only example of the increas-
ingly social games of today.

A ’ There’s_ another, perhaps
even bigger, phenomenon
that’s swept the video game
world -in the last year: the Wii.
Nintendo realized that instead
of ‘ super-advanced graphics_
and» amazing reali_sm, what’ 3

people really want from their

entertainment is just that: en-
tertainment. , .

People, believe it or not,
want to have fun when they’re
trying to have fun. Sure, daz-
zling graphics and FMV se-
quences and hyper-realistic
physics are cool and all, but
they don’t make a game. So

instead of concentrating on

all that stuff, Nintendo did

something different and concentrated
on the interface. Andnow my mom will
sit around playing golf on the Wii and,
humming along to songs she knows on
Guitar Hero.

Of course, these aren’t the only exam-
ples. For instance, look at Halo, which
has pretty much built its success. on the
popularity of its multiplayer mode and
took Xbox Live from an annoying fringe
service to one of the best things about
having an Xbox. And I shouldn’t even

have to mention the huge number of

tournaments and competitions growing
up around video games these days.

The other thing that’s great about vid-
eo games moving from a nerdy outcast
activity to a mainstream form of enter-
tainment is it gives developers and play-
ers more room to ‘experiment with what
they «want toldo. Take “Rock Band,’_’ the

- . next follow-up.to ‘.‘Guitar Hero,” as an.

example.

The people making this game have .’
- taken the engine that made the originals

such a success, with the notes scrolling

the whole scope of a band: guitar, bass,
drums, and vocals. . -

The whole point of this game is to get t

three or four people together and play a

boanld,_only with the added beneﬁt of not

needing any real musical talent.

However, this increased socialization
does beg thequestion of whether or not
video games are the same thing that they
used to be. Previously, there’d be a cou-
ple groups of people at every high school
and college that would hang out and play

' video games while the other “cool” kids _

were out at parties or playing" football or
whatever. ‘ 4 I - I
But now that video games are reach-
ing an increasingly broad and more
mainstream audience, is ‘it really _right
to still perceive them as being an “un-
cool” activity? Ithink that we should

think of video gamesﬂin the same _way;
» that we think ‘of movies and television, ‘_
because they’ve really become just as

mainstream as any other form _of enter-.

’ tainment.

Sure, you’ll' still have -the occasional

-oddball_ who claims they meltbrains‘ or
make kids go‘ crazy, but they said the".

same thing about rock music and slasher
ﬁlms. Video games are the new “cool,”
andincreasingly they’re the new social
gathering pointas well. '_ ' .

, «Last -kMonday’s Jena 6 protest woke me‘

up. '
_ I don’t mean this in‘ a metaphorical

sense. No’, chants of “free the Jena 6” and

“no justice, no peace” literally woke me out

of my nap around 2 p.m. on Monday.

_I "don’t normally have .a problem with

protesters —' they do have a constitutional

right to assembly —. but the two hours when
I’m_ not feeling well and am just trying to

- get a little‘ extra sleep before a doctor’s ap-

pointment is not the best time to bother me.
_ A» Of course, if the protestiwere capable of

actually achieving a concrete objective, I

wouldn’t mind as much. ' ’ - '

» However, the fact that none _of the Jena‘

tempted .second-degree murder for- the
beating of a white- classmate, are currently ~

in jail and thus. carmot be freed, leads me.
to believethat‘ students were holding this
protest more out of a commitment to their
self—importance than tojustice for th_eJena

6.. As faras‘ I’m concerned, personal. em-i

powerment is not a good enough reason to
wake me up. ' A V ' '

Although the “free the Jena 6” chant was
simply unnecessary, the phrase “no justice,.
, ’ no peace” and its context deserves some se-

rious consideration. ‘ 2

First of all, I recognize that the local"

court proceedings in the Jena case were a
sham. In fact, I started following the ease

‘ a few months_ ago before the protests, the

mainstream media coverage and the Face-
book groups. ’ ‘ , ‘ ' ‘ -

' I take issues like this very seriously; I’ve
goneto the lectures on Mumia Abu—Jamal,
I’ve researched the case of Leonard Peltier
and I’ve volunteered at the Thomas Merton

Center mailing books to prisoners. The ac- '

tivism surrounding social justiceissues is

_ something with which I’m well acquaint-
. ed _o . .

the charges were excessive, the fact remains
that these six students beat-another student,
according to the Associated Press, “into a
state of bloody unconsciousness.”

The Facebook groups and the national
ﬁgures such as Al Shaipton seem to ignore
this fact butI.can’t. I _ . .

' Indeed, I fear that the students and politi-

known as the Jena 6. However, although’

Campus rally blindly    

Jena 6

However, the Jena 6 are not ‘folk heroes,
they are not modern equivalents of Emmett
Till, and we must not allow _ourselves, even
in our outrage over the injustices perpetrat-
ed in Jena, to treat them as such. A

it Instead of blindly championing the case

» of the Jena 6, we must recognize that the le-. _

gal system is capable of adequately resolv-
ing this case. , j —

Already, the Third Circuit Court of Ap-
peals has ruled that"Mychal Bell, who was
16 at the time of the attack, cannot be tried
as an adult. Bell is now out on bail and his

' case is in the hands of capable defense at-
torneys rather than overworked public de— ‘

fenders.

I Not onlylis/lBell,'no longer‘ in prison,‘ ’_
' charges have been reduced across the board

as the justice system proves that _it is capa-

ble of recognizingtand addressing the legal ,
misconduct of La Salle Parish _Dist1iet.At-
tomey 1. Reed Walters." A J * f
I This reversal is probably, in some part,
' inﬂuenced by the early protests and media a
attention. I applaud .those who took part" .
‘ early "on in raising awareness of this case so I
i that justice could be had for the Jena 6. ~

‘However, the most_ recent protest com-

‘pletely ignores these latest developments

and thus the use of the phrase “no justice no

peace” was completely irresponsible.

It appears to me that they simply‘ chose a
phrase with a strong history in various pro-
test movements and used it because it made

them feel powerful. In fact, the only people
. who seem to have been denied peace in this

instance were the students, staff and faculty
of the University of Pittsburgh. ‘
Believe me, I recognize that there are

-good intentions at work ‘here, that many of

my peers mean well in raising awareness.
about this» case but good intentions are no
excuse for ignorance.

. 4 Frankly, we. should all be aware of this a
case because it is a perfect cautionary tale A

for the new student left: Pick your battles

‘and don’t be afraid to question the leader- ’_
ship of organizations suchas‘ the NAACP. V
. Failing to unquestioningly support Al ’

Sharpton’s latest cause does not make you
a bad person. I‘ '

Either way, next time someone wants
to stage a protest that involves loud noises,

; just send me an e-mail. We’ll ﬁnd a way to

work around my nap schedule so that no
one is deprived of his or her constitutional
right to assembly and I’m not deprived of a
few more hours of sleep.

by Jacob Spears
Staff Writer

One look at Diana Shearwood’s
photograph, “Decadent Chocolate
Chip,” an inkjet print of a devilishly
inviting cookie, and viewers might
think that her focus _is on ‘food pho-
tography alone.

But in another section of her ex-
hibit, “What’s for Dinner?” at Silver
Eye Center for Photography, we see
that “Decadent Chocolate Chip” is
in fact an enlarged detail of a cookie
advertisement on the side of a com-
mercial truck.

All of the images in the Quebec
photographer’s “What’s for Dinner?”
focus on the ubiquitous, embellished
‘food advertisements on commercial
truck trailers.

Through Shearwood’s work, the
fixation on appealing food images in

10

our culture becomes startlingly ap-
parent. - V

When we see these ads on the road, ‘

the advertisers’ aim is to conjure up
ideas of savory, fresh nourishment. .
The fact isgthough, thatthe food
inside these trucks is often transport-
ed for thousands of miles‘-before it

‘ reaches the grocery store.

Shearwood’s work seems to con-
demn ‘the way food is marketed,
mass-produced and transported, but
she is quick to point out that her pho-
tographs are more documentary than
anything else.

At a talk for the show’s opening at
Silver Eye, Shearwood emphasized
that her photographs stem from an in-
terest in Capturing the world around
her.

“To me, these photographs are ob-
servations of a phenomenon that’s in
the world,” Shearwood said. “I don’t
deny that the pictures raise certain
issues about advertising’s role in the
environment, but I don’t think I have
an answer for them.”

Shearwood’s pictures of these 18-
wheelers achieve diversity through

.the framing of each truck. Some are

For T he Pitt New

'With soothing melodies and story—rich
lyrics, Sea Wolf ’s latest release takes indie

rock to new. levels of calm.» V
_ The new album, Leaves in the River,
is Sea Wolf.’s'ﬁrst full-length release after

their EP,"Get‘ to thetRiver Bef0're'It Runs
Too Low, dropped in May. ' C . '
Leaves in the River presents a folk-lik

brand of indie’ rock‘ that pleases the ears _

and the mind. i'I‘he careful and creative

lyrics Sea Wolf offers weave a tapestry of A
, mystical and romantic tales. C

Lyrics are poignant, and the instrumen-

tals are deliberate. In the tracks, strings,‘ "

guitar, bass, drums and vocals meld to-
gether, and somehow, these standard in-
struments produce an incredibly original
sound. 4 ' ' _ V

The title ‘track, “Leaves in the River”

is reminiscent of a lullaby, because of its-

hushed tones and “baby music” keyboard.
It is very calming, particularly with the
sound of water ﬂowing and the softer
acoustic accompaniment.

“Winter Windows” picks up the pace

with circus—like instrumentals, and “Black

Dirt” offers pleasingly placed breaks and

long, drawn out vocals in the chorus.
Another track, titled “The Rose Cap-

tain,” combines‘ gentle acoustic sounds for

a slowly ﬂowing, romantic ballad. “Mid-
dle Distance Runner” delivers a driving

. rhythm set in contrast by airy vocals.
Thissong has a dream—like quality and‘

lyrical hooks that could score it a spot on a
TV show. Scrubs comes to mind, and fans

might picture ID. in one of hisdaydreams '
- upon hearing it.

“Song for the Dead” features a switch
in vocal style that creates a ﬁttingly creepy

tone, given the dark subject matter. “Neu-

tral Ground,” on the other hand, switches

things up for a more sentimental feel, with ,
romantic overtones and lilting acoustic

guitar.
“The Promise” concludes the album on

a peppier note,_‘with an upbeat melodyand‘
‘a faster tempo. ’ A

Characteristic of SeaWolf’s latest is its
clever lyrics, ideal pacing and interesting
accompaniment. V ' '

The entire album possesses a nostalgic, V ,

fairy tale quality that conjures up memo-
ries of being read to at bedtime — that
is, if your storytellers were members of a
cool California indie band. . ‘

While the tracks are each chapters in

y the book of Sea Wolf, they satiate the need

for both mellow tunes andintriguing lyr-
ics. For the fuzzy feeling of musical sa-

tiety, Leaves in the River’s price is a pit-

tance well worth paying.

Shearwood asks viewers, "What’s For Dinner?"

Dinner, page 10

the surroundings of the truck. This
often serves as a further comment on
the appetite-inducing photos within
Shearwood’s photos..

But these ads aren’t just an Ameri-
can phenomenon. [Shearwood started
her project in Canada, and over the
course of four years of work, she’s
traveled from North America to
France, England, China and Moroc-
co.

Perhaps the co1lection’s most
striking image is “Steak,” featur-
ing an l8-wheeler with a juicy steak
painted on the side. Behind the truck,
the American flag ﬂutters in a clear,
blue sky.

On the other end of the spectrum
are Shearwood’s photographs of
close—up food ads that could easily

«be confused with pictures of the food

products themselves.

In these images it is often only a
door handle or-the bottom runners of
a trailer that let the viewer know that

_it’s actually a picture of a picture.

Shearwood referred to this reveal
through small detail as “de-familiar—.
izing the familiar.” ’

-In other words, by framing her
subject in such.a way, she is able to,
in the first instance, evoke the same
response the images on the trucks
aim to trigger. But on a closer look,

_ the realization that the image we are

looking at is a picture of a picture
forces ‘us to examine our original re-
sponse to the image. ’

This is why Shearwoodis unsym- _

pathetic to critics of her work who

denounce her for taking pictures of"

pictures.‘

“Someone was really offended I .
-was taking photos of photos,” Shear-

wood said. “But to me that’s missing

the point.” A
_ It’s only through this meta—pho—
tography that we are able to question

what we see constantly in out every-
day lives. .
Perhaps the most interesting aspect

of “What’s for’ Dinner?” is Shear-
wood’s ability to shoot the ads that_
splash across these trucks without re-
vealing her opinion onthem.

In the end, viewers will come away
with different ‘reactions. It’s truly
possible for one person to walk away
from the exhibit with a sick stomach,
while another might headto the gro-
cery store, anxiously asking, “What’s
for dinner?” '

Pitt men’s soccer continued to strug-
gle on Friday, losing to No. 2 ranked
Connecticut, 4-0.

The Panthers found themselves lag-
ging behind, 3-0, at the half after the
Connecticut offense erupted with three
goals inll minutes (26, 31 and 37).

Despite better defensive play in the
second half, Pitt couldn’t solve its of-
fensive woes. Pitt failed to capitalize

on three corner kicks.

The Panthers have now played four
games in a row against top—20 oppo-
nents. In front of a crowd -of 4,329, the
Connecticut attack put on a show,.

Connecticut found the back of the
net one more time at the one—hour
mark. It was the final blow to the Pan-
thers’ defense. .

UConn out—shot the Panthers, 17-6,
putting 10 of those shots on goal and
allowing just two on goal from Pitt.
Goalie ‘Eric Barnes tallied five saves
for the Panthers. ’

Despite the loss, Pitt coach Joe
Luxbacher said there were some bright
spots for his team, which is still fight-

ing for a spot in the Big East tourna-
ment.

“The game _wasn’t as bad. as the,

score made it seem,” Luxbacher said.
“We did some very positive things, but

T we made a few mistakes.”

Those mistakes were enough for
Connecticut forward O’Brian White,
who capitalized on Pitt’s defensive
errors and tallied three scores on the
game .

White, a junior, now leads the Big
East in goals with 11 this season. It
was the first hat trick of his career.

“He’s very talented,” Luxbacher
said of White. “We knew that going in.
But they have a lot of weapons, and it’s
hard to get focused on just one.”

The win was just one more in a con-
tinuing trend for the Huskies.

7 Connecticut improved its record to
11-1-0 (5—1—O Big East). They have
now shut out eight of their 12 oppo-

nents, allowing three goals this sea-

son.

The Panthers (1—8—2, 0-4-1 Big East)
continue their tough stretch of games.
Pitt will try to rebound Wednesday
night at home against nationally ranked
West Virginia.

Cincinnati, Louisville

sneak out Winsat Pitt  

by Zack Chakan
Stzzﬁ’ Writer

It seems like Pitt’s soccer programs
just can’t escape heart-breaking losses.

On Friday night, the women’s team‘

gave up the winning goal with only a
minute left in double overtime to fall to
the Cincinnati Bearcats, 2-1.

They followed that with a Sunday
defeat at the hands of Louisville, 1-0, at

I Founders Field.

The two losses dropped Pitt’s record
to 6-6 overall and 1-4 in the Big East.

“We didn’t execute defensively on
both goals,” Pitt coach Sue-Moy Chin
said.

Chin praised the competitiveness of
the Big East conference.

“In the Big East, every game is like
this, every team is good, anyone can beat

14

anyone on any certain day,” Chin said.

Pitt begins a four—match road trip on
Saturday at No. 16—rar1l_(ed Connecticut.

Cincinnati 2, Pitt 1 -

The ﬁrst half was relatively unevent-
ful for both sides, but a bothersome trend
developed early for the Panthers. I

Cincinnati controlled the possession
throughout the half, yet cou1dn’t develop
many offensive chances.

It wasn’t until the last minute of the
half where the action really took off.
Pitt’s Rebecca Fraser took a good shot
aimed at the top of the net.

It took a fantastic leaping save by Cin-
cinnati goalie Andrea Karninski to pre-
vent the Panthers from taking the lead. I

Karninski’s valiant effort was wast-
ed seconds later when Pitt sophomore
Boivin notched her ﬁrst career goal on a
header.

Stars to shine

at Pitt-Na

by J eff Greer

‘.1?’

Former Heisman Trophy winner and Pitt
alum Tony Dorsett will join Navy alum Roger
Staubach, who also won the Heisman, to serve
as honorary co—captains for their alrna maters

. Wednesday night at Heinz Field when Pitt hosts

Navy at 8 pm.

Pitt will also honor recently retired Jets run-
ning back and former Pitt star Curtis Martin at.
halftime.

The game will be nationally televised on
ESPN, with play-by-play armouncer Rece Da-
vis and color analysts Lou Holtz and former Pitt
defensive lineman Mark May.

Dorsett played with Staubach in Dallas from
1977 to 1979 before Staubach ended his Hall of
Fame career.

Dorsett set the former NCAA career rushing
record of 6,082 yards on a 32-yard run against
Navy in 1976. Pitt trumped the Midshipmen,
450, en route to a 12-0 ﬁnish and a national
title. ~ 0

Dorsett won the Heisman that same season,
while Staubach won his in 1963.

Martin is fourth on the NFL career n1shing
list.

Louisville stuns Pitt in

frustrating overtime thriller

Women's soccer, page 14

The match opened up in all facets in
the second half. The tide turned for good
in the 66th minute.

Cincinnati.’s Melissa Bigg delivered
the comer kick into a crowded Pitt box.

The Panthers had chances to clear the
ball but failed. '

Emily Hebbeler ﬁnally corralled the
ball and knocked it through the trafﬁc to
equalize the score.

The ﬁrst overtime came and went
without any scoring, but Pitt outshot Cin-
cinnati, 3-0, in the period.

Their inability to ﬁnish came back to
bite them.

Pitt had another defensive breakdown
with less than one minute remaining in
the second overtime.

« Pitt’s defense whiffed on clearing the
ball out of their zone and Bearcat Kendall
Loggins sent the Cincinnati fans intohys—
teria by kicking the ball past a helpless
Alison Finch for the Victory.

1 ‘Finch recorded six saves for the night,
and Karninski had eight for Cincinnati.

Pitt outshot Cincinnati, 14-13, but it

was Pitt’s ‘defensive shortcomings that
ﬁnalized the decision. ’
“It’s_ tough to lose with a minute left

in the match, especially at home,” Chin’

said. _ g
“We’re going to regroup for Louis-
ville.” ‘ 6

The full 90 minutes passed without a

weekend matches. I H

Pitt once again out-shot its opponent,
7-5, going into the overtime period.

Pitt’s offense couldn’t capture a goal,
however, and Louisville was able to strike
for the win. . -

Five minutes into the ﬁrst overtime,

Shannon Smyth took a long kick from

goalkeeper Joanna Haig and turned it into
a goal past Finch.

The goalies weren’t too busy for the
match, with Finch stopping three shots
and Haig recording only two saves.

According to the article, it won’: have as dras-

But then, shouldn’t all bull-riding scores
