Second Open House
Invites Local Public
To Inspect

The University plays host to the public this Sunday at an
“Open House” designed to acquaint the people of Pittsburgh
with the officers, facilities and plans of their largest school.

V

Cathedral

Opeif House is similar to the

onecarried out this past Sunday for a group of invited guests.
It will, however, be on a much larger scale.
University officials, headed by Bishop Brown, director of

that several thousand Pittsburgh-
ers will attend this Sunday’s af-
fair.

Already community-wide invi-
tations in the form of announce-
ments through press and radio
have gone out.

The Chancellor and the com-_
mittee on arrangements for the
Thanksgiving Open House wish
to thank the members of the
University family: the trustees,
the faculty, the students, the
alumni, the staff of buildings
and grounds, the elevator oper-
ators, the telephone service,
the University cafeteria, the
Heinz Chapel Choir, the build-
ing custodian service, and all
those loyal people who helped
so much to welcome and en-
tertain the friends of the Uni-
versity. ‘ Bishop Brown

Committee on Arrangements.

As now planned the Open
House will follow the same plan
as last Sundays gathering. Guests
will be taken by elevator to the
upper floors of the Cathedral from
whence they will view points of
~ interest during a tour of the build-
ing.

After their tour the guests will
meet Dr. Rufus H: Fitzgerald,
chancellor of the University, in the
Commons Room. Also on the pro-
gram are tours of the Nationality
_Rooms, gifts of the various na-
tional groups in the Pittsburgh
area, and the Early American
Room.

Year-Old Check Room
Already Too Small

Although the infant University Check Room has yet to cele-
brate its ﬁrst birthday, it has proved its worth to the extent that
enlargement and improvement of its facilities is already underway.

In the ﬁrst week of December, the check room will have com-
pleted its ﬁrst year of service to faculty and students. During this

time the checkroom has been used by 1600 to

from 8:00 a. In. to 10:00 p. m.

After completion of the enlarged‘

cloak room, reports J. Edward
Ricart of the dean of men’s office,
the room will be equipped to han-
dle as many as 3500 people a day.
New racks will increase the num-
ber of coats which can be checked
from 600 to 1200.

Since its inauguration the check-
room has gradually increased its
services for the ' student body.
There are both inkwells and pen-
cil sharpeners at the checking bar
so students ned not make trips to
the ﬁrst ﬂoor Information room.
Furthermore, an efficient staff of
two full time and nine part-time
aides takes care of coats for any
University social function.

The checkroom will have a new
concrete floor, and a long check-

1800 people a day

ing bar. This will eliminate rush
hour- queues from crowding out
into the hall. Although the lines
at the checkroom doors have not
been alarming, « Mr, Ricart ‘an-
nounces that this long bar will in-
sure a very small wait for service.

The two sections of the com-
bined checkroom will be separated
by partitions during the months
of April to October when traffic is
not extremely heavy. In fall and
winter months, however, both sec-
tions will be open for checking.
Improvements in service have
been made for umbrellas, rubber
footwear, and luggage.

Most of the work will be done
during the Christmas vacation so
that present facilities will not be

hampered.

Players to Use .
Plasticlighting

Because of the unusual lighting
effects necessary for “The Flies,”
plastic lighting will be used for
the ﬁrst time in this Pitt Players
production, scheduled for Dec. 9,
10, and 11. This effect is rela-
tively new to the stage, but has
been used extensively in the
movies.

According to Steve Skirpan, in
charge of lighting,
moods of the play are created by
varying intensities and hues.

‘ The scehery is made in- plastic
units, so that it can be rearranged
for the different scenes. The plas-
tic lighting, which either‘comes
from directly overhead or from
spotlights hidden at the feet, ac-
cents the shadows on the scenery.
The scenery is painted in neutral
colors, and coloring will be ac-
complished by means of colored
lights. .

Skirpan also plans to have a
dimout at the beginning and end
of each act.

Banquet Fetes
Pitt Gridders

Pitt officially closes its 1948
football season, the most success-
ful in a decade, tomorrow eve-
ning when it banquets Mike Mil-
ligan’s varsity and freshmen grid-
ders.

Dudley DeGroot, head coach of
the West Virginia football team,
one of the six Panther victims this
year, will be guest speaker at the
affair held at the Schenley Hotel
at 6:15 p. m.

Toastmaster Chester L. Smith,
sports editor of the Pittsburgh
Press, will also call on Chancel-
lor Rufus H. Fitzgerald, Milligan,
and two busy men on the banquet
circuit, David L. Lawrence, mayor
of Pittsburgh, and Ray Evans,
star of the Pittsburgh
‘Steelers. '

Trustees’ Nod,

Of Approval

BULLETIN

 

ment of Pitt’s new Athletic Di-
rector was delayed last night
pending the expected, stamp of
approval of the University's

at 1:30 p.m.

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
discussed those being considered
for the vacant directorship, in-
cluding Captain Tom Hamilton,
and the plans for the “overall
and integrated athletic and physi-
cal education set-up” with the
athletic committee and‘ under-
graduate deans for close. to an
hour Monday evening. _ -

 

Pitt’s Athletic committee
may have a Christmas presen
for the University. ‘

From all present indications
Captain Tom Hamilton, nation-
ally-known athletic director
and former football coach of
U. S. Naval Academy, will become
Pitt athletic director before" De-
cember 25.

It appears that Captain Hamil-
ton would be a popular choice. _
Meeting Moved Up

A premature report that the

mittee’«s No. 1 choice resulted in
the moving up of a meeting sched-
uled for Dec. 10 to last night.-
The athletic committee with the
undergraduate
lor Rufus H. Fitzgerald, and act-
ing Athletic Director Frank Car-
ver ‘met to consider “Captain
Thomas Hamilton and others, ac-
cording to an announcement by
Chancellor Fitzgerald. ‘
Absence of denials indicate
that “the others” includes ‘Lloyd
Jordan, athletic director and grid

man, head football coach at Rut-
gers, and Jack Harding, athletic
director at Miami (Fla.) Univer-
sity. All are former Pitt gridders.
Not Damaging ‘

Although the surprise release of
the Hamilton story in the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette,Thanksgiving
Day marked another smear on
the University’s press relations,
at least one committee member
feels that it will not be damag-
ing.

The leak appears to have come
from outside the committee.

Captain Hamilton has been con-
tacted‘ by the committee and stat-

that “I am very ﬂattered that Pitt’

would consider me,” but refrain-

ed from further comment.
Hamilton Fills Bill "

His selection would ﬁt the spec-
iﬁcations for the post, as presented
in Chancellor Fitzgerald’s Friday
statement.

“The choice of a Director will
be inﬂuenced by the comprehen-
sive program that is being plan-
ned for the new gymnasium and
the new ﬁeld house. These two
units will play an important part
in Pitt’s athletic future.

“These additional facilities for
both intercollegiate athletics and
for physical education will make
it necessary that the man select-

 Total 
Still Below
$5800 Goal

Pitt’s Chest Drive, with ﬁnal re-
sults not yet tabulated, is still a
few hundred dollars short of its
$5,800 goal. Student contributions
and pledges amounted to approxi-
mately $5,300.

Figures for the Medical and
Pharmacy Schools have not yet
been received in the dean of men’s
oﬁice. Contributions from these
two schools have not yet been
tabulated as their donation proce-
dure is different from that used in
other schools, Chest chairman‘
Abby Clark reports.

Although the drive fell short of
its goal, it compares favorably
with thespring semester total of
oily $1,200. In last November’s

sxdrive, $6,000 was received.

The $5,300 will be apportioned
among the 92 Community Chest
groups, the World Student Service
Fund, Pitt-in-China, Men and
'\'v”omen’s Loan Fund, the United
Negro College Fund, and CARE.

ed have a broad background in
both ﬁelds.”

Should he be the choice of the
committee and deans, Captain
Hamilton would have to indicate
his availability before his name
is given to the Board of Trustees,
or its committee, for ﬁnal approv-
al, which is expected to be auto-
matic and unanimous.

The top-ranking Annapolis
athletic ﬁgure was contacted by
a member of the athletic panel,
reportedly Vincent Lanfear, dean
of the school of business admin-
istration.

Captain Hamilton has been af-
ﬁliated with the Naval Academy
since he played football there in
the ’20’s. He coached the grid
teams of 1934-35-36 and of 1946-
47, becoming athletic director last
June. _

Carlson and Fatigue Curves
Defend Sport of Basketball

By MYRON KOPELMAN .

, Doctor H. Clifford Carlson is one coach who answers the charge
that basketball is harmful to health with more than a “Nah, it ain’t
so.”

Fifteen years ago Dr. Carlson set out to prove——scientiﬁcally,
statistically, and factually—-that the game actually strengthens a boy
instead_of tearing him down. He:

invented what he calls the “fa-
tigue .curve.”

The fatigue curve is a charted,
line that tells you approximately
how fast and how often Forward
Dodo Canterna will break for the
hoop. It tells you approximately
how many time outs Mort Lerner
will need. It tells you if Sammy
David is stronger this week than
he was last week.

The process of charting fatigue
is not complicated. The good doc-
tor merely has his players run in
place for a given period of time,
recording the number of steps
taken by each boy.

As soon as a player is through
running, the speed of his heart-
beat is recorded.

What is the result? Well, as
the days go by, the legs move

faster and the hearts beat slower.
In short, the boys get stronger.

“After I put a player through a
fatigue test,” Carlson explains,
“he always feels that because he
has done his very best_ he cannot
possibly improve. But Nature re-
wards him for doing his best by
giving him a capacity for doing
still better the next time.”

Mike Belich, for example, could
grind out only four steps per sec-
ond on October 19. Less than a
month later, little Michael was
churning his legs to the tempo of
six steps per second.

The important point is that as
Mike plays more and more bas-
ketball according to a scientiﬁcal-
ly-planned schedule, the stronger
he becomes. Mike doesn’t look
ready for a sick bed.

If Ben Grady’s Panther swimmers are to continue an un-

einjury early in the game. Pulled

knee ligaments will keep him out
of tomorrow’s ﬁnale. Two regular
ends, Bob Geyser and Jack Adams,
missed the Phi Gam fray because
of injuries. _
Overshadowed in other games
by Wicks, Bob Badke proved a
star in his own right by sparking
the Locals to the win. Badke
threw two scoring‘ passes, a short
one-yarder to Tank Valicenti and
a 20-yard aerial to Gene Gaugler.
Both teams were hampered by a
slippery ﬁeld and battled through
a scoreless ﬁrst period. A pass in-
terference penalty called on the
Phi Gams’ Bob Horner in the end
zone gave the winners a ﬁrst down
on the Fiji one early in the sec-
ond quarter. Two plays later,
Badke hit Valicenti for- the score.
Tommy Carr intercepted a pass
thrown by Skip Rebele on his own
10 in the third stanza and ran to
the Fiji 30 where he was caught
from behind by Horner. A mo-
ment later, Badke found Gaugler

‘-open in the end zone and threw to ‘

him for the touchdown.

In the ﬁnal period, the losers
put on their best drive of the day,
going 60 yards for their tally. A
pass from Homer to Bill Lynam
who lateraled to Rebele was the
big gainer to the Local 10. From
there, Rebele rounded right end
to score. .-
