VOLUME EIGHTY, ISSUE SEVENTY-SIX

By Dan Bates
News Editor

The university administration has found the
Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority guilty of violating
the university hazing policy, according to Stu-
dent Activities Director Andrew Smith.

Yesterday, Smith released his decision after
giving the sorority a chance to appeal his deci-
sion to the vice president of Student Affairs.
The sorority, however, chose not to appeal.

According to a letter from Smith to Panhel
President Paige Allen, the sorority has been
placed on probation for “the two pledge pro-
grams succeeding the one currently in pro-

BAS holds

gress. "

The letter also listed three stipulations that
the sorority must follow. First, the sorority must
provide the Greek adviser with a complete
outline of its pledge programs two weeks prior
to each recruitment period. Second. the sorori-
ty’s pledge educator and each pledge class must
meet weekly with the Greek adviser during their
pledging period. Third, all pledge activities
must be approved by the Greek adviser before
they can be implemented.

“Any violation of the conditions of the pro-
bation or any further hazing violations may in-
voke sanctions up to and including revocation
of the chaner of the sorority by the universi-
ty," Smith stated in the letter.

Sorority violates university hazing policy

“Some of the sorority’s pledge practices were
indeed found to be in violation of the universi-
ty's hazing policy," Smith said yesterday.
“And like I’ve said before, the university will
not tolerate hazing.“

Smith began his investigation after Fonda
Duse, a freshman pledge, approached him about
several incidents of alleged hazing between
March 1 and 15. Neither Smith nor Duse would
disclose any details about the incidents, but
Duse did say the sorority made her do things
which were humiliating to her. 6

“They preach to be ladies, and they are con-
tradicting that," Duse said. ‘‘If it's going to
belittle my womanhood, then I refuse to go
along with it." .

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 1986

Duse, who originally approached Smith on
crutches, claimed that her knee was re-injured
as a result of the hazing. She said she first in-
jured her knee in high school.

On Monday, March 17, Smith met with the
sorority to inform them of the hazing charges.
At that time, Smith also suspended the sorori-
ty’s activities and pledge functions pending a
hearing which was set for Friday, March 19.

The hearing lasted two and a half hours as
at least eight people testiﬁed on behalf of the
sorority in an effort to convince the university
to dismiss the hazing charges. The complainant
and her mother were also present at the hearing.

The sorority could not be reached for com-
ment about the university's decision.

ceremony

By Douglas Bennett
Staff Writer

Speaking at the Black Action Soci-
ety's 16th annual inauguration Monday
night, newly inaugurated leaders pro-
claimed unity among blacks to be a fun-
damental goal.

In her farewell address. Deputy

1985-86 administration. White com-
mended the BAS for organizing one of
the strongest Black Weeks in years.
noting in particular the overwhelming
success of the speech by Rev. Louis
Farrakhan.

White also conducted the swearing
in of the new chairman, Anthony
Baldwin, and deputy chairman, Sheila
Beasley. In a brief inaugural address,

Baldwin said the main goal of the BAS
“will be to achieve a stronger relation-
ship with the black students at Pitt and
to establish good relations with other
student groups.”

Deputy Chainnan Beasley, in her in-
augural speech. also expressed her ob-
jectives. “My first objective will be to
promote the concept of a black peoples‘
unity and develop a positive environ-
ment for blacks at the university."

Beasley also cited the problems in
South Africa and the low educational
morale among high school blacks as
major obstacles confronting blacks.

“Too many issues affecting blacks
are being swept under the rug,"

Student hit

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

An unidentified Pitt student was hit
by a car last night on Fifth Avenue out-
side the William Pitt Union. The
woman was taken to Presbyterian-
University Hospital where she was
listed in good condition, according to
a hospital spokesman.

New BAS Chairman Anthony Baldwin and Deputy Chairman

 

Sheila Beasley pose after their inauguration.

Beasley said. “We’ve found that too
many black freshmen aren’t graduating,“
Beasley concluded by challenging the
university’s policy on blacks and ques-
tioning if officials weren‘t merely us-
ing them to ﬁll quotas.

The featured speaker was Dennis
Schatzman, former editor of the Pitts-
burgh Courier and BAS board mem-
ber from 1971-72.

“Blacks should strive to reap what
this university has to offer — the

athletic, academic and extracurricular
opportunities,” said Schatzman.

Schatzman gave a chronological
history of blacks at Pitt, citing in par-
ticular the Computer Center takeover
of January 1969. Schatzman reminded
the audience that the incident was proof
of what black students can accomplish.
Schatzman said he sees a new
seriousness among today's black
students, which he termed “a very,
very positive step."

by car on Fifth Ave.

The woman was hit by a car making
a left turn from Bigelow Boulevard, ac-
cording to police.

The pedestrian crossing signal was
ﬂashing “walk" when the woman was
crossing the street, according to Phillip
Loevncr, a witness at the accident.

“She was walking across the street
within the crosswalk when the car came
around the corner and smacked her,”
said Loevner.

‘‘It was the driver’s fault.” Loevner
said. “She [the driver] cut the corner
and hit the woman crossing while she
was still in the bus lane."

Police did not release the driver’s
name at the time of the accident. Police
said the victim may have back and neck
injuries, but the Presby spokesman said
she was in good condition and was still
undergoing examination. The woman
was conscious when the paramedics
arrived.

The state attorney general’s office
yesterday seized the assets of the
Decade, an Oakland nightclub that has
allegedly run up a more than $50,000
sales tax debt.

In response, the Decade ﬁled for
bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy laws. State ofﬁcials
said the Decade may reopen as soon as
they notify the sheriff’ s office.

Deputies from the Allegheny Coun-
ty Sheriffs Office arrived before noon
yesterday to lock up the building,
which is located at 223 Atwood St. in
Oakland. The Decade was padlocked
to secure the inventory until County
Sheriff Eugene Coon could schedule a
“sheriffs sale,” during which the
assets would be auctioned with the pro-
ceedings going toward the business’ tax

debt.

Susan Cercone, the deputy attorney
general of the Pittsburgh office of the
collections section, said the debt stands
at $51,756.82, which includes tax,
penalty and interest for various month-
ly periods dating back to 1982.

Cercone said the Decade also owes
the state $5,122 in withholding taxes
deducted from employees’ paychecks.

“We've been trying to get them to
pay for about the last 18 months," Cer-
cone said. “People don’t take it
seriously until you show up at the
door.”

Authorities went to the Decade
yesterday morning and asked for ap-

proximately half of the money owed,

about $33,000, according to Cercone.
Cercone sail the Department of
Revenue had previously worked out a
payment plan with the owners of the
Decade to pay back their debt, but the

Divestment concert
planned for Saturday

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

The warm weather is back, and with
it have come the sunbathers, Frisbee
players, the I-lari Krishnas dancing
across the Quad and, of course, out-
door concerts.

To open up the outdoor concert
season on Flagstaff I-lill, three area
bands will present a free concert at 2
p.m. on Friday. However, there is
something more than entertainment
behind this particular concert.

Rock Against Racism is the result of
the combined efforts of Pitt's Students
for a Free South Africa and CMU‘s
Students Against Apartheid. In addition
to the three bands —— ATS, Rod McCoy
and Silk and Strikers — featured
speakers will address the issue of
racism not only in South Africa, but
here in Pittsburgh as well.

“What I expect the concert to do is
to bring in a larger and a new audience
which hasn’t previously been aware of

the problems in South Africa — or of
the racial problem here at Pitt," said
Andy Arnowitz, oneof the concert‘s
organizers.

Rock Against Racism is one of hun-
dreds of events being held nationwide
in recognition of National Anti-
Apartheid Day. April 4 has been
designated Anti-Apartheid Day to com-
memorate the assassination of civil
rights activist the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.

Kurt Resch, guitarist and lead
vocalist for Strikers, said he likes the
idea of confronting a social problem
with an outdoor concert.

“it’s a nice approach to something
like this, to enjoy yourself and yet to
do something meaningful too,” Resch
said. “We‘ve really got to wake peo-
ple up  it’s a stepping stone."

Resch said he feels the music of
Strikers, a reggae/rock band, is par-
ticularly relevant to the anti-apartheid
cause. “Our music has a very African
sound,” he said.

Israeli radio
“in bad taste”

JERUSALEM — An Apnl Fool‘s Day
joke backfired yesterday in Israel. Israeli
radio falsely reported that Lebanese Shiite
Moslern leader Nabih Berri was wound-
ed in an assassination attempt. The aniiy
conceded a branch of military intelligence
was responsible for the hoax. Said a
military spokesman. “A young soldier
pulled a joke. It was in bad taste."

BEIRUT. Lebanon Lebanese
govemment sources said France is pull-

the decision stems from increasing hostili-

Report Hazing

Hazing once plagued colleges and universities across
the country as fraternities and sororities made hazing
an integral part of pledge activities. Unfortunately, such
activities have resulted in physical injuries and even
death, in some cases. In recent years, however, most
Greek organizations have put forth a tremendous effort
to eliminate such unethical pledge initiation rites, thus
cleaning up their image as well as protecting students.
Now hazing is frowned upon by both the universities

and most Greek organizations.

At Pitt, the administration has created and enforced

a stringent policy against hazing. Pitt’s Interfraternity
Council and Panhellenic Council have also made a wor-
thy attempt to curb hazing on campus. We commend
such efforts, but, as we have seen in the past four
months, hazing still exists. Last December, two students
were injured in an incident. Just yesterday, the univer-
sity sanctioned a sorority for violating the hazing policy.
_ Both cases weretbrought to the attention of the univer-
sity administration by students who justifiably sought
an end to such foolishness. They cared enough to stand
~ up for themselves and for other students who must face

such unnecessary treatment.

Unfortunately, most hazing incidents go unreported.
Students are humiliated, yet they accept hazing as merely
incidental. Most students living on campus have heard
at least one hazing horror story within the past year or
so, but very few students have the guts to speak out
against such abhorrences. Perhaps they just don’t care.
Nevertheless, hazing must be eliminated on campus.
And this must be accomplished through the students who
care about Pitt’s Greek system. Just remember, each
hazing violation, no matter how isolated the incident,

scars the future reputation of Pitt’s Greek system.

Letters to the Editor -—-————

N 0 Break

I was surprised to read that the
University of Pittsburgh is considering
changing its calendar to allow a Spring
Break so we students won't become
depressed (The Pitt News, March 21).
Also under consideration is conversion
of the Spring Term to a Summer Ses-
sion of 10 weeks.

I will truly be depressed if the
trimester system is modified so that I
cannot take a full load of classes in the
summer. Part of Pitt’s appeal is the fact
that good classes are in session year-
round, enabling students to complete
their studies as quickly as their energies
will allow.

Pitt students currently have many
choices:

0 Attend school year-round.

0 Attend school fall and winter;
work or play spring and summer.

0 Attend school any two terms and
work or play the third.

0 Attend school any one tenn and
work or play the other two.

The Academic Calendar Review
Committee may rob us of these alter-
natives. If the proposed changes are
implemented, Pitt may become like
most other schools —— two real terms
with a so—so summer session.

The trimester system is unique and
serves the urban population of Pitts-
burgh well. It allows workers to attend
school at night and on weekends all
year. Academic goals are reached
sooner by year-round attendance.

It may be that the Ft. Lauderdale—
bound group wants university sanction
of an extended holiday. It also may be
that professors are exerting pressure to
have a lighter load in the summer.
Whatever the pressure group(s) is/are,
the university must remember that we
students are their reason for being. The
university exists to serve us, to give us
a quality education. Professors can
negotiate contracts to allow them sum-
mers off. I, on the other hand, want to
study year-round to obtain my diploma
as soon as possible. With a declining
18-21-year-old studentpopulation, it is
important for the university to meet the
needs of older, working students, a
growing market for all institutions of
higher learning.

Students who agree with this position
and graduates who have beneﬁtted
from the trimester system should write
to ( I) Dr. John R. Quatroche, secretary
of the University and chairman of the

Academic Calendar Review Commit-
tee. and (2) Provost Richard Benjamin.
Make them aware of the importance of
retaining the trimester system.

Greeks Respond

On March 28. you published two let-
ters (by Miss Watson and Mr. Frazier)
that dealt with the issue of racism at
Pitt. Among others, however. they also
said some things about the fraternities
at Pitt that are absolutely wrong. As
such, I am prompted to clarify these
matters.

First of all, there are no “black“ and
“white" Greeks. Every fraternity that
is recognized by the Interfraternity
Council is distinguished by its letters
and not by the race of its members.
Besides, there are “white" fraternities
that have members who are blacks.

Second of all, the IFC as well as the
Office of Student Activities have an
alcohol policy that governs the ac-
tivities of all fraternities. Except rush
(which beginning in September will be
non-alcoholic), open parties are not
allowed. Every social function is open
to invited guests only. Miss Watson’s
statement that “[white frats] allow
students of other schools to attend [their
alcoholic parties]” is wrong.

Thirdly, the lFC’s policies affect all
of the fraternities -— “white" ones as
well as “black" ones. And, of course,
anyone who is not recognized by the
IFC is not a Greek.

Fourthly, the statement  the
“black" Greeks at Pitt don't have lux-
ury dorms to have a party  like the
“white“ Greeks on the hill" is also
misleading. For one reason, the houses
on the hill are not dormitories. They
are considered private fraternity
houses, leased by the university to the
fraternity‘s corporation. Every frater-
nity was given the opportunity to move
into them. For a second reason, the on-
campus fraternity houses are governed
by the policies of the Office of Student
Activities -— as well as IFC‘s —— and
not by the policies of the Office of
Residence Life, like the Towers Lob-
by. For a third reason. there are only
seven (out of 21) fratemities on the hill.
Of the other 14, only ﬁve have private
houses. Nine others also have no

private houses. Should they utilize the
Towers Lobby for their parties tool’
Finally, 1 would like to add my per-
sonal comment. I failed to see the con-
nections between the situation in the
Towers Lobby and the “white" frater-
nities on the hill that Miss Watson and
Mr. Frazier attempted to make. lfl am
to follow their logic. then any frater-
nity that doesn't own a house should
be allowed to use Towers Lobby to par-
ty ~ once they are not allowed to do
so in the Student Union. I also failed
to see the parallels between the Towers
Lobby, which is a public and common
area. and the fraternities on the hill.
which are private fraternity houses. But
as I said. this is my own opinion. My
main goal was to clear up any
misconceptions about the fraternities at
Pitt.

Helping Hands

I would like to thank The Pitt News
staff for the praise given the Hand-in-
Hand Festival in the two articles
printed in the March 24 issue. The
editorial article and “Hand-in-Hand: a
volunteer looks back" were both
excellent.

The editorial entitled “Hand-in-
Hand" very accurately described the
ability of students to unite and create
a meaningful event for the benefit of
many people.

The article in which a volunteer
looks back did an excellent job describ-
ing the motivation for this unity. This
article literally brought tears to my
eyes. The enjoyment experienced dur-
ing the festival by the child and the one-
on-one volunteers was captured
magnificently by this article.

Your praise is greatly appreciated.
However, I believe I can speak for the
majority of Hand-in-Hand staff and
one-on-one volunteers when I say the
children's smiles make all the work and
hours of preparation well worth it.

U.S. Looking For A Fight

I'm tired of the United States stick-
ing its nose into other people’s
business. I'm also tired of the way we
take the bombing of Libyan soil so
damn lightly. How many people stopped
to think last week that we’ve got the
makings of a terriﬁc war. Actually, we
have the makings of two terriﬁc wars
-— — one in the Middle East and another
in Central America. Now, I don’t
worry about being drafted myself.
There are enough battle—hungry people
around who will be willing to take my
place.

   

An alarming feature of the debate on
aid to the Contras is that it is being con-
ducted almost wholly on the basis of
an old man’s paranoid fantasies. Ter-
riﬁed by the redbaiting tactics of
Reagan and his team of McCarthyite
malingerers, Democrats make false
confessions of agreement with the of-
ﬁcial administration assessment of the
situation, begging to differ only on
method — or, in the most feeble cases.
only on timing. Few, if any, bad the
courage to straightforwardly challenge
this utterly preposterous account. But
Nicaragua is clearly not a threat to the
United States, the Contras are man-
ifestly not freedom ﬁghters and the
Reagan policy is obviously immoral.
This —— not Reagan’s personal apoca-
lyptic fantasy -— is the bottom line. the
basis on which the debate should be

Page 5

The battles in the Libyan Gulf last
week were called “military exercises,“
or something like that. Bull. Missiles
were fired, bombs were dropped, ships
were sunk and radars were blown up.
People on the Libyan boats drowned —
you know, they died by sucking water
into their lungs — and the United States
calls what they're doing “military
maneuvers." I think the word they’re
searching for is “war." They must be
confused — maybe they’re still groggy
from their afternoon nap. Why does
everybody take it all so lightly? Maybe

conducted.

Indeed, it is alarming that there is
debate on this issue at all. Sometimes
there comes a point where your op-
ponents are so incoherent that the best
approach is just to ignore them. For ex-
ample, take the evolution vs. crea-
tionism dispute. The scientiﬁc debate
was settled decades ago — to argue
whether creationism or evolution is true
is to argue an utterly dead issue. In-
deed, just by entering the debate we
give creationism more credit than it
deserves, by acting as if there is an
issue worth arguing at all. What we
need instead is a broadly sociological
account of why anyone would believe
such a thing. What is it about the
degeneration of modern society that
would lead people to resuscitate such
an antiquated dogma‘? Once we have

it’s because it’s fashionable once again
for America to be “tough."

But I guess it‘s cool that President
Reagan is flexing his muscles, making
America tough again. Sure makes me
feel proud and secure. But I always
thought “military maneuvers" weren‘t
hazardous to your health. Reagan is
making American soil safe from the
spread of communism. I can see his
point: Hell, if a Central American
country goes, well we can write off
Mexico, and then the next stop is
America. That‘s really what those

fellas are up to, isn't it‘?

So let’s send $100 million in military
aid to the Contras. Why not non—lethal
aid‘? I would go for that, but the presi-
dent won’t. ljust don't like the idea of
ﬁnancing a war in another country.
What really scares me is the new plan
to send U.S. helicopter pilots into Cen-
tral America.

Human terms. We have to start
thinking in terms of human life, not
global ideological threats. I think it’s
interesting that President Reagan

reduces the "conllicts“ to ideological

answered that question, we have dis-
covered something interesting about
creationism.

Regrettably, by this stage similar tac-
tics are also required in the case of Star
Wars. The fact that Star Wars could not
work and that it is the beginning of a
new and disastrous arms race are the
irrefutable bedrock from which the in-
teresting debate begins. What we have
to ﬁnd out is why anyone might be
motivated to deny these transparent
truths; fortunately the answers are
easier here. Star Wars means big
money for research scientists, for the
Pentagon and most importantly of all,
for defense contractors. In opposing
Star Wars, it is a waste of time to argue
the technical issues; genuine argument
always tends to fare badly against self-
serving rationalizations. Rather. we

have to think of how to change our in-
stitutions so that rational policymaking
does not have to compete with vested
economic interests.

This perspective is not an irrationalist
one. There most certainly is a place for
considered debate of competing views.
The prerequisite for such debate,
however, is a minimum level of in-
tellectual sophistication and integrity on
both sides, and that is exactly what is
lacking in the case of Nicaragua. We
shouldn't be wasting time and energy
in confronting Reagan's lie and distor-
tions directly. Since facts and rational
deliberation have already had no role
to play in the formation of his views,
there is little point in using these
methods in response. Indeed, just by
holding such views. Reagan places

differences. Maybe he doesn‘t realize
that there are families that grieve for
the loss of their family members to the
wars we finance. When you fall into
that pattern of thinking, you lose all
perspective on what war really achieves

—- a lot of dead people. War and’

fighting doesn’t solve anything, itjust
creates bitterness in those people who
are dominated by force. We just hap-
pen to be the ones with the force.
We‘ve got our foot in the door —— it‘s
only one small step away. Read some
history books. It‘s the trend of the ages.

himself outside minimal standards of
intellectual responsibility. What we
have to do instead is address the fun-
damental political motivations which
underlie his approach. The important
issue is not whether the Contras are the
moral equivalents of our founding
fathers but the possible reasons Reagan
and his coherts of ideologically blind-
ed zealots might have for promoting
such a wildy implausible view.

This, then, is the challenge in the
Nicaragua debate. We shouldn't just ig-
nore the incoherent ravings of the right;
we also have to isolate and deal with
the political problems which cause the
debate to take on such a hideously
distorted form. Why do conservative
policymakers feel driven to pursue this
grossly overstated pseudo-problem?

Student places in Japanese contest

By Lori Grandillo
For The Pitt News

Although acquiring a second
language is often a long, difficult proc-
ess for many people, Darius Green-
idge, a first-year graduate student at
Pitt, has mastered the Japanese lan-
guage._

He placed third at a Japanese speech
contest, which was held at Johns
Hopkins University in Washington,
D.C. on Friday, March 7. Out of the
six participants who placed in the com-
petition, Greenidge’s placement of
third won him a prize of $200 and a
certiﬁcate.

“About 22 participants competed in
the tournament, which was open to
people from all over the country,"
Greenidge stated. “The only real
restriction on the competition was that
no participant could have lived in Japan
for more than two years."

Greenidge’s speech for the touma-
ment, which lasted for six minutes and
was completely memorized. was taken
from a novel entitled “Satomi Hak-
kendcn." In English. “Satomi Hak-
kenden" means “The Eight Loyal

Dogs of Satomi.“ The entire novel,
based on supernatural tales in feudal
Japan. was written by a 10th century
novelist named Takizawa Bakin.

“I first read this book when I was
in Japan and noticed that one of the

Japanese ‘newspapers had published it
as a series in each edition," said
Greenidge. “When I came to Pitt, I
was able to locate “Satomi Hak-
kenden" in a shortened version.
Because I liked it so well, I re-read the
book and decided to use it as a source
of my speech for the competition.”

Greenidge has attended several
universities before coming to Pitt. His
major is in geology, and he actually
considers Japanese as a “hobby.”

“In high school I took several
Japanese history courses, which I really
enjoyed," Greenidge said. “After high
school, I attended the University of
Colorado in Boulder, where I majored
in geology, yet continued my studies
in Japanese. ‘

“Most of my courses involved learn-
ing the Japanese language. Although
the beginning was hard, especially
learning a whole new alphabet, it did
get easier later."

Greenidge said he also took some
French courses, but learning two
languages at once became confusing,
so he dropped the French and concen-
trated on the Japanese.

Greenidge then transferred to State
University of New York in Buffalo,
where he continued his study of the
Japanese language.

“After studying Japanese in Buffalo
for two years, my teacher recommend-
ed that I actually go to Japan to further
improve my skills in the language,”

said Greenidge. With the help of a
group called the International Christian
Organization, Greenidge went to Japan
for a year that he describes as “the best
experience in my life.”

Although he basically stayed in
Tokyo, Greenidge and his group trav-
eled to such areas as Sendai in northern
Japan, Kyoto in the South, Nuggato on
the west coast and the main island of
Nagoya. What most impressed
Greenidge about Japan was the friendly
people, and he hopes someday to return
to Japan.

When Greenidge returned from
Japan, he continued his studies at the
University of Pittsburgh.

“I was really impressed with the
good geology program here at Pitt,”
he said. “In addition, I also feel that
their Asian Studies program is also
very, very good."

Greenidge has taken several Japanese
language courses and he enjoys work-
ing with his current Japanese professor,
Keiko McDonald. In fact, Greenidge
laughs as he remembers that it was by
her urging that he got involved in the
Washington, D.C. tournament. Green-
idge said if the opportunity arises
again, he would participate in another
tournament. Although Greenidge en-
joys the Japanese language and culture,
he is now working on his masters de-
gree in geology, and eventually he
hopes to obtain his doctorate in that
field.

NMR Institute dedicates suite

Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh NMR Institute has
dedicated a suite in its complex to a
woman whose medical service spans 61
years.

Elizabeth R. Childs. M.D., made
significant contributions to society
through her activism throughout her
career. During the 19305, Dr. Childs
examined “wayward" women for the
city of Pittsburgh. She was appointed
to the part-tirrie post by the League of
Women Voters who felt this was a
necessary service to the community. As
a result of this experience. Dr. Childs
helped create a statewide system of
premarital serology (syphilis) testing.
Her instrumental work has led the test

to become mandatory for all couples
who wish to marry.

Dr. Childs graduated from the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine. Another of Dr. Childs‘ ac-
complishments was through her work
with state officials and other physicians
to develop a health insurance program.
The program she helped create has
become known today as Blue
Cross/Blue Shield.

Dr. Childs, at the time she opened
her Homestead office, was one of on-
ly 12 female physicians in Allegheny
County. These early years of Dr.
Childs‘ career were without the beneﬁt
of modern medicine that the NMR In-
stitute's services provides. Medical
supplies such as penicillin, sulfa drugs,
vaccines and anti-toxins were
unavailable at the time she worked.
However, today, advancements such as

Sophomore wins sweepstakes

A Pitt sophomore has won $10,000
in the American Express College
Sweepstakes. Sharon Yeager. 23, in a
ceremony on the Pitt campus in

. Oakland, received the $10,000 check

today from Joel Ginsberg, vice presi-
dent of Marketsource Corp. , the com-
pany that promoted the sweepstakes.

Yeager, who lives in North Hills,
turned down the grand prize — a 1986

Ford Mustang Convertible — re-
questing the car‘s cash value instead.
“Ironically I entered the contest
because I like Mustangs," says
Yeager. “But I already have a car, and
when I realized how much I‘d have to
pay in taxes and insurance, I decided
against getting it. " Yeager plans to use
the money to pay debts, travel to
California and save for the future.

the NMR Institute allow physicians to
gain information about a person
without the use of tubes. needles, in-
cisions and probes.

This is one of the most important
aspects of the new suite at the Institute.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the
new technology located in the suite
dedicated to Dr. Childs, is a technical
procedure that uses powerful magnets
to provide important research data
about the chemical composition of the
human body. This new process elimi-
nates the need for tissue samples and
the subsequent risk associated with
biopsies.

“Although the technology [of the
NMR Institute] was unavailable to Dr.
Childs during her medical practice,"
said Gerald L. Wolf, M.D., Ph.D. and
NMR director, “she has enthusiastical-
ly followed the progress of the In-
stitute.“

For the last 25 years that Dr. Childs
practiced general medicine, she had her
office on Craft Avenue. The NMR In-
stitute was built next to Dr. Childs’
medical office which now serves as her
home.

When asked about her thoughts on
the Institute, Dr. Childs stated, “It's
a marvelous diagnostic tool." She said
she was “entranced”with the new con-
cept of imaging and is especially im-
pressed with what she called the ex-
quisite detail of the neurological
pictures.

Astronaut pushes space program

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Astronaut Jay Apt said Thursday that
American space exploration beneﬁts
the entire nation, not just the Defense
Department.

“The capabilities of the Space Shut-
tle are unique in all the world,” Apt
told a packed Pittsburgh Press Club.
“The effects of living and working in
space on science, engineering and
medicine have been phenomenal."

American business, Apt noted, has
much to gain from the Shuttle Pro-
gram. Various steel companies, he
said, have contracted NASA to study
cast iron under various temperatures
and pressures. Westinghouse has asked
the space agency to test the new rail
gun. Several pharmaceutical companies
are waiting to have new drugs
researched.

Such experimental work in outer
space, Apt said, figures to be much
easier once the United States “has ac-

cess to a permanent space facility." He
believes human presence in space to be
essential. '

“Man’s being in space is critical,"
Apt stated. “Only he can repair equip-
ment and decide what is important. 
It is he who has made the difference
between success and failure."

Apt believes the Challenger tragedy
must not deter future manned flights.

“It’s important to realize," the
astronaut said, “that going into space
will always be a bold venture ~ it will
never be perfectly safe."

Dr. Paul McWilliams, director of
Pitt’s NASA office, agrees that one in-
cident should not be permitted to crip-
ple an overall successful program.

"The Challenger explosion was a na-
tional tragedy, no question about it.
he said. “However. WC C11“ hi1V‘_~‘ 1‘
plane crash, even a crash of a defec-
tive military aircraft and it‘s over in a
week."

Both Apt and McWilliams. though.

 

approve of NASA’s one-year freeze of
Shuttle flights.

“The public is upset," McWilliams
said. “A highly visual government
agency spending tax dollars is, and
should be, responsive to the wishes of
the people."

Once normal operations are re-
sumed, Apt believes the Shuttle Pro-
gram is likely to continue to soar.

“You ain‘t seen nothing yet " he
remarked in closing.

Walk Through History:
Pitt creates winning football team

By,ﬁn1Ihﬂnnan
For The Pitt News

Editnr’s note." This is the ﬁﬁ/1 in (1
series ()farti(‘l(’.s‘ written by mt’!!!/7(’I',\‘
of Omicron Delta Kappa Honor Society
in cnnimernrirutiori ofthe universit_v'.s‘
bicentennial.

Imagine the reaction of the football
coaching staff today ifonly $2,000 was
available for equipment. uniforms,
training and the like. Yet $2,000 was
all it took to transform a winless Pitt
football team in 1903 to an undefeated
powerhouse in 1904.

According to Rev. Guy D. Wallace.
a football player at the time, it was the
transformation of Pitt into a “big foot-
ball” school. What is especially in-
teresting is that the subject was
"taboo“ for at least 20 years after a
scandal following the 1904 season.

The football team. which was
organized in the late 1890s. had con-
sistently average or less-than-average
seasons before 1903. But in 1903,
“football reached the lowest depths of
debility." according to a letter from
Wallace to a university representative
in 1936. Pitt was 0-8-1, and in the Penn
State game, the Panthers were sound-

V ly defeated by the “rather cmde" score

of 54 to 0. “This was so bad. a reac-
tion set in." commented Wallace in the
letter.

That was when action was taken by
the university administration. Pitt
alumni and other city patrons together
donated $2,000. and Wallace notes in
his letter that Andrew Mellon con-
tributed SIOO. “That financial cam-
paign was the beginning of the big foot-
ball enterprise at Pitt.“ as Wallace put
it.

It was also the start of player recruit-
ment, and a group of players from
Geneva College, who according to
Wallace were “very successful," was
brought in. As a side note on one of
the players. Col. Joe Thompson,
Wallace writes that: “Col. Thompson
had played years and years. At one of
the games. I heard someone ask. ‘Is
that old Joe Thompson. who used to
play around here long ago?‘ The reply
was. ‘Oh, no. That is his grandson.‘ "

The change in monetary and
recruiting fortunes led to a drastic
change in the team‘s fortunes on the
field: An undefeated season (all
shutouts save the last game) ended with
Pitt handing Penn State a 56-5 bruising.

With this dramatic swing in team
ability and school spirit came the prob-
lems that accompany newfound fame
(and newfound donations from alum-
ni). Shortly after the end of the 1904

season. ambition and greed on the pan
of the administrators led to a well-
publicized dispute and hushed scandal.

“Joe Thompson wanted Coach
Mos.se‘s job. and Dr. Friezell wanted
cvcrybody’s job, and there were plots
and schemes and the worst of bitter
feeling." wrote Wallace. He men-
tioned that the football players
themselves were dragged into the
dispute and that he himself testified that
“$200 of student fees had been
embezzled." which “afterwards
proved to be too moderate." He com-
mented in the letter: “You would be
surprised, I think. ifl could remember
and tell you all the scheming. plotting.
lying and hating that went on that
winter of 1904-5.  However, the big
enterprise was staned and has gone on
grandly ever since."

Wallace wrote at the end of his let-
ter that. in spite of the bad memories.
he “enjoyed the success of the Pitt
teams. always feeling that I had plenty
to do with starting it and honestly not
caring that I became persona non gratia
to the powers that was lsicl."

In concluding his letter. Rev.
Wallace observed that “the starting of
the big team was most opportune. It
came just when the university needed
publicity badly. it made the university
more popular in Pittsburgh than it had
ever been within my knowledge."

Inter-religious relationships

By Nancy Quick
Staff Writer

I was telling David about the feature
I'd just been assigned to write: on inter-
religious dating and its ramiﬁcations.
David, a Jewish sophomore at Pitt who
says he had a fairly conservative Jewish
upbringing, laughed out loud.

“I don't see what the big deal is,
Nancy." he said. “I mean, come on
— were living in the '80s."

If living in the '80s implies existing
in a society where spiritual and moral
restrictions are no longer relevant, then
inter—religious relationships would not
be difﬁcult. Jewish/Christian couples
would not feel pressured by a social or
parental threat of non-acceptance. In a
world where religious differences
didn't matter, belief systems would be
unimportant. Society would have
discovered a way to live on a socio-
political surface that has no spiritual
base.

A reality of living in the ’80s,
however, is that no matter how contem-
porary one's thinking may be. each in-
dividual is the product of his belief
system. Dr. James E. Long Jr., pastor
of Beulah Presbyterian Church in
Churchill, said that our belief systems
determine everything that we do.

“The word ‘to believe‘ is derived
from two words meaning ‘by’ and
‘life.’ " he explained. “What you
believe is how you live your life.“

Nowhere is this more relevant than
in the realm of love relationships. ac-
cording to Long. Two people decide to
include each other in their lives and
thus incorporate two belief systems into
one. On the basis of common belief,
they build and strengthen their relation-
ship. A marriage is therefore based
upon spiritual values. The closer one‘s
spiritual values are to those of one's
partner. the better the marriage‘s
chance for survival.

“Marriage is tough." Long said.
“There is nothing more challenging in
contemporary living than to pull off a
healthy marriage and to keep it that
way. Because there are so many things
that can potentially divide a couple, it
is essential that there be something
down deep on which they can agree and
to which they can turn for the strength
to stay together.“

At the foundation of a Jewish/Chris-
tian relationship is a contradiction of
spiritual values. What Long describes
as the common denominator in a rela-
tionship is. in this situation, not com-
mon at all. Instead of providing a start-
ing point. a base on which a couple can
agree. it is itself a point of dispute.

And every one that heareth these
sayings of mine and doeth them
not, shall be likened unto a
foolish man, which built his
house upon the sand 
Matthew 7:26

Take Cathy, a Catholic, and Eric, a
Jew. who were involved in a serious
relationship and have since broken up.
Cathy (whose name, like the others in
this article, has been changed to insure
her anonymity), said that because of
her experience. she has decided never
to date a Jew again.

“No matter how free—living the ‘80s
are,“ she said, “our religious dif-
ferences represented an unresolvable
conflict.

“We had a lot of other problems
with our relationship,” she explained.

“At times, everything was so over-
powering. I'd think, ‘Since we have no
future, should I end it now?‘ The basic
religious conflict told me there was no
futufe. The other problems only deter-
mined when the inevitable would hap-
pen."

I Cathy, like many women in her
situation, found the experience of a
serious inter-religious relationship
painful.

“The emotional part of me said, ‘I
like him. I like being with him. That
should be enough.’ The other part of
me saw the relationship was not work-
ing," she said. “I had to forfeit one
part for the other. For me, there came
a point when I had to be functional and
not follow my emotions."

It was painful as well to put up with

“It seemed like such an in-

justice. These religious con-
ﬁnes were being imposed in

our relationship, and we had

nothing to do with them. ”
Jennifer
A Protestant Junior

the comments. mostly jokes among
friends, that alienated her from Eric‘s
lifestyle, she said.

“I didn't appreciate being called his
shiksa," Cathy said. “I soon learned
the Jewish dads have this saying: Chris-
tian girls are for practice. It was
degrading. And the worst part of it was
that Eric either joked about or avoided
the whole issue. It made me think he
was not serious."

The religious differences in their
relationship were not discussed serious-
ly, and created a gap of understanding.
“He‘d always make these offhand
comments about how he was going to
raise his kids Jewish. I’d say, ‘Not
married to me, you won’t.’ Neverthe-
less, I felt the force of the Jewish
religion at times like that, as if I had
to make the sacrifice."

It was in fact the Jewish community
that introduced the inter—religious rela-
tionship as a serious issue, a threat to
the survival of Judaism. Most literature
on the subject is written from the
Jewish perspective. Reformed rabbis
are particularly concerned with
counseling the inter—religious couple.
Rabbi Joseph Levine is one such
counselor. He wrote his thesis on the
phenomenon of inter—religious
relationships.

“The dimensions of this issue are
striking and unsettling for the
American Jewish community," Levine
said. “Studies indicate that the rate of
intermarriage could be as high as 50
percent — one out of every two mar-
riages."

Shall we again break Thy com-
mandments. and make mar-
riages with the peoples that do
these abominations? Wouldest
not Thou be angry with us till
Thou hadst consumed us, so that
there should be no remnant, nor

any to escape?
Ezra 9:14

IUI
Zljdj:

l______........

‘When beliefs conflict,

The practical issue becomes one of
survival for the Jewish tradition and
community. Traditionally, the
historical background of Judaism is
very clear in its strict prohibition of in-
termarriages. Because an inter-
religious relationship represents a
threat to the Jewish culture, it is for-
bidden by Jewish law.

The strength of Jewish law therefore
determines the terms by which the
Jewish/Christian couple must com-
promise in order to stay together.

“If a couple is intending to maintain
a clear affinity for both religions, it
would not be possible for myself as a
rabbi to consecrate the marriage," said
Levine.

According to Jewish law, intermar-
riage exists only if the non-Jewish pan-
ner converts.

And this is where Cathy's problem
with Eric's attitude lay. Jewish tradi-
tion says that a couple marries in order
to build a Jewish home and join the
Jewish community. Marriage, for Eric.
represents the establishment of an in-
herently Jewish way of life. This is not
true for Cathy. who sees their religious
differences as spiritual. not cultural. So
she felt threatened when Eric assumed
his children would naturally be raised
in the Jewish tradition.

Eric and Cathy faced a basic con-
tradiction in their belief systems —— the
deﬁnition of a family. For Cathy.
Eric's unwillingness to even talk about
compromise showed the impossibility
of their relationships continuing.

For Jennifer and Michael, however,
the same issues that made Cathy and
Eric's relationship impossible actual-
ly brought them closer together.

Jennifer. who is Christian, dated
Michael, who is Jewish. for several
months without experiencing a
religious conflict. But as Michael
moved out of the area and the relation-
ship shifted into a long—distance one.
the issues of the future and therefore
religion were ﬁnally confronted.

“When you put distance between any
kind of relationship. I think it forces
you to evaluate it," said Jennifer. “In
our case. to consider the future, we had
to consider the religious conflicts. It
was a question of: Where do we go
from here and how do we go?"

Reared in a family in which neither
religious nor ethnic criteria were
stressed as the most signiﬁcant factors
in choosing a mate, Jennifer was con-
fused by the religious confrontations.

“He confronted the religious issue
ﬁrst,” said Jennifer. “I didn’t under-
stand it enough to confront it. He talked
about the future. and how he couldn’t
help but think of me in it. but how he
also couldn‘t think of a future without
Jewish children and a Jewish home."

Jennifcr’s reaction was to blame the
culture.

“It seemed like such an injustice,”
she said. “These religious confines
were being imposed on our relation-
ship, and we had nothing to do with
them."

Jennifer and Michael’s relationship
continued, growing stronger, but still
not really confronting the problems
they would have to face in a future
together, or even the notion of a future
together. Finally, one night, Jennifer
received a phone call.

“He made this declaration: ‘You're
mine, and I’m yours. I don‘t want you
to see anybody else. I won't see
anybody else,’ ” she said. “Then he
had a discussion with his parents and

can love last?

“The dimensions of this issue are striking and unset-
tling for the American Jewish community. Studies in-
dicate that the rate of intermarriage could be as high
as 50 percent ——- one out of every two marriages. ”

Rabbi Joseph Levine
Counselor

told them the declaration and the
seriousness of our relationship."

Rabbi Levine referred to a situation
like this as one in which the couple
believes a “myth that says if we feel
comfortable together, if we love each
other enough, everything will be OK.

“Couples who persist in believing
this myth don’t want to have to face the
reality of the situation," he said.
“They don’t want to face these dif-
ferences and make these decisions."

Jennifer said that she can't help but
face the differences. “The reality is
that I’m studying for a final and think-
ing about how I'm going to raise my
kids at the same time,” she said.

“The religious differences between
two people force their relationship to
either one extreme or the other," she
said. “Either we stay together and defy
our families, or we force a breakup that
neither of us wants. But there is no in

between."

Jennifer and Michael are planning to
continue their relationship in spitelof
the obstacles. Their story might repre-
sent a victory over cultural restrictions.
Still, they represent two opposite
spiritual identities, two conflicting
belief systems.

“The differences deﬁnitely come
out, especially when the subject of
children comes up," said Jennifer. “I
can see both of us compromising,
though, although we don’t talk about
it constantly. We are both drifting
toward this center of values and spirit
that is founded more on a humanist
ground than either religion. We’ve both
kind of internalized our religions.”

As a generation living in the ’80s, we
may be able to oppose and eventually
redefine the restrictions and taboos of
society. But how do we combat our
own beliefs?

Foundation grants wishes to local kids

By William Young
Staff Writer

When lite-threatening diseases strike
children, life seems hopeless. They are
conﬁned to daily routines that are
necessary to keep them alive. These
children. victims of leukemia. cancer
and other terminal diseases, often grow
tired. frustrated and lose hope while
facing the daily struggle.

Hope, however. has arrived. The
Make—A—Wish htundation of Western
l’enn.sylvania is trying to add to their
hves by granting each dying child one
wish.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation was
founded in Pittsburgh at the end of
I983 and granted its first wish in May
of 1983 to Bryan Mc(‘linton of
MeKeesport. Bryan had a simple wish;
he wanted to travel to Texas for a
piggyback ride by his favorite uncle.
MAW granted the six—year—old's wish.

Wishes are granted to kids between
the ages of two and I7 who have been
certified as having a life—threatening ill-
ness or disease. “Wishes“ are made
known to the foundation via relatives,
teachers. nurses. doctors or friends.

No wish appears to be too big.
either. One child in Los Angeles asked
the MAW chapter there if he could be
with his grandmother. This may not
sound like an extraordinary wish until
one considers where his grandmother
lived — in Iran.

“No. I don't think that there is a
wish that is too big.“ said Michele
Atkins. the chairman of the Wish (‘om-

inittee. “As long as it [the wish] falls
within the three criteria. then we will
not deny the wish. Circumstances
sometimes don't allow a wish - a
celebrity says no or the wish is
unfeasible.

“We had a wish from a boy in
Washington County who loved to
fish." explained Atkins, “but he had
been confined to a wheelchair and
couldn‘t get near a lake. so we actual-
ly built him a pond with a million
gallons."

Kelly ()"I‘oole. chairman of the
Publicity Committee. agreed. “No
wish is really too big. If a child asked
to go for a ride on the space shuttle.
though. we might have to settle for
watching a shuttle launch. We get the
child's wish and do the best to make
it come true."

Money is not an obstacle either. This
is partly due to firms and companies
that underwrite the expenses or do the
work for free as an “in—kind" dona-
tion. “Money is not the factor." said
Atkins. “None of the wishes have
come close to bankrupting us."

The only factors that have to do with
the granting of a wish all concern the
child who is “wishing." First. the
child must be two to I7 years old. Sec-
ond‘, the child must have been

diagnosed by a doctor as having a life-
threatening illness or disease; and third.
the wish must be the child's. not one
imposed on him by his parents. When
a wish request comes in. MAW forms
a special two-person “wish team" to
visit the child and discuss the request.

  

“The wish team can usually find out
if it is the child's wish." said Atkins.
“Two- to six-year-olds usually do not
ask for a trip. The wish team sits down
with the child and asks whv the kid
wants the wish. They talk with him and
determine the base. or true wish."

The wish, however, is not only for

the child, but for the entire family. For
many parents, the decision to contact
MAW is a difficult one. It nteans the
parents are facing the possibility that
their child may die. and this is often
a reality that they wish to avoid for as
long as possible. Parents. however,
have never stood in the way of fulfill-
ing a wish that their children have

requested.
"We've never had a parent who‘s
stood in the way." Atkins said.

“We've had parents. though. who have

 

had slight problems with some aspect
of the wish. We hail one mother who
was so deathly afraid of flying: llli"

They are the ones w ho must go to com

help the family if problems arise dur-
ing the wish.

The only thing required of the farm-
ly is that they enjoy the wish. They are
not responsible for the financing or
coordination of any part of the wish.

“We do budget for wishes," said
Atkins. “but we take things as they
come. lt [a wish] should not cost the
parents any money or emotional
strain."

MAW’ is run by volunteers and
public donations and is a nonprofit
organization. With the fame of MAW
spreading faster than the cash flow and
volunteers coimng in. there are a few
problems with organizing wishes.

Entrepreneur scoops
his way to fame

By Pam Marvich
Staff Writer

Howard Carney is the founder of
Smop—D-Doo, u d()g—(Ir()pping remain]
miripany seniing Pittsburgh and sur-
ruuiidiiig suburbs. Recently, smite (‘on-
trm'ers_\‘ arose in the Pittsburgh area

Sump-I)-I)(m. He t‘atidi(Il_\' talks about
the ¢'.rperr't'ii<'e, and how he mine to be
(1 pauper scririper. "

PSM: Here's a question you probably
hear all the time. How did Scoop—D-
Doo get started‘?

Carney: A friend of mine, Jeff Hitch-
cock. worked for a dog—dropping re-
moval service out in Denver called
Poop-Van—Scoop. Poop-Van-Scoop has
over 2,(X)O customers. averaging about
$14 per customer. That's funny, huh?!
It's real funny; I know. Someday I
hope to be that funny myself! Well
anyways, he wrote me a ﬁve—page let-
ter asking me to go into partnership
with him out in Las Vegas. He said
Denver was pretty well monopolized,
and it's pretty hard to lose a customer.
You ﬁnd once you get one. they stick
with you — I've never lost a customer,
unless they‘ve moved or gotten rid of
their dog. Once you get them. you‘ve
got them for Ebod. It's just that nobody
seems to want to do it. so I'm doin‘ it.
Okay. so anyway. I wasn't about to
move to Las Vegas right away — I like
Pittsburgh too much — so I talked to
my attorney about it. and she said that
somebody already picked up her lawn.
She said her lawn people did it every
week when they cut the grass; they

   

charged $3 extra just to pick up the
droppings. Two days after I talked to
her, she called me and said to go ahead
and start cleaning her lawn. She said
she didn’t think they were doing a good
job, and she wanted me to take over.
So I went over every week for two
months, just to make sure I was gonna
stick with it. After that, I put out an
advertisement, one of those tear sheets
with my name and phone number on
it. and posted them around Peters
Township. I got one customer from
that, and I was so excited. because now
I had two whole customers! Then I
started advertising in The Pennysaver
and here and there, and I got a
customer there. and then I expanded.
PSM: So how many total customers do
you have?

Carney: About 65 now.

PSM: And you work by yourself?
Carney: Oh yeah, yeah. I ﬁgure I can
handle at least 250 customers per week.

PSM: Wow. that's a large number. Ex-
actly how long ago was it that Jeff con—
tacted you?

Carney: He wrote me the letter in
February of '85. In March I was talk—
ing to my attorney, so that's when it
started. I then started adding things to
the service. For instance. now when-
ever I pick up the droppings. I sprinkle
hydrated lime. In the summertime it
keeps the odor down and keeps the flies
off. because I can’t get I00 percent of
the droppings. Do you have a dog‘?
PSM: No. no I don't. I used to but he
passed away.

Carney: Oh. I'm sorry. Well.
anyways. a couple of the dogs I ser-
vice are chained outside. in a conﬁned
area. so I put straw around. I pull some

of the old straw out and put new straw
down outside the dog house, or
wherever it’s muddy along the cable
run. I've put up a few of those runs,
too. And I also visually inspect the
droppings for irregularities which may
indicate illness. See, you have to be
careful. I can’t say that I‘ll tell you if
your dog is sick or not; that's false
advertising.

PSM: Well. this may be a silly ques-
tion. but what do you do with the drop-
pings after you pick them up‘?
Carney: I put them in plastic bags, and
then wrap them up and put them in a
dumpster.

PSM: I didn‘t know if it was used for
fertilizer or anything.

Carney: A farmer friend of mine out
in Hickory, Pa.. said I could bring it
up to his ﬁeld and dump it ~—— far away
from his house. of course! But that’s
a lot of work for me, and I'm also wor-
ried about the parasites and the
diseases. One sick dog could cause a
lot of trouble. Eventually, I would like
to have at least 500 customers to keep
busy, and there would be too much of
a chance of spreading disease. I take
precautions now not to spread disease
by using sanitary measures if possible.

PSM: What were you doing before you
started Scoop-D-Doo?

Carney: I maintained shopping centers
in the South Hills.

PSM: Did
anywhere‘?

Carney: Yes. I went to Pitt for two
years and majored in speech and com-
munications. It really helped me in the
TV interviews and appearances; they
got me a couple of customers. I also

have a cat service with Scoop—D—Doo;
did you know about that? I build a
shelter, which holds eight cat trays
(i.e., litter boxes). Initially I ﬁll it with
eight clean trays, then come by each
week and pick up the dirty ones,
replacing them with clean ones. Do you
have cats?

PSM: No, no. I have a guinea pig. Do
you have a guinea pig service‘?!
Carney: Yes, I do! No, I'm just kid-
ding. But seriously, I have a couple of
customers with cats that also have
guinea pigs, and they asked me ifl do
guinea pigs. That‘sjust too much. Well
anyways, with the cat trays. the shelters
are situated outside. That way the
customers don't have to be at home
when I come by to pick up the trays.
It's outside. they have a steady supply
and their house doesn‘t smell. I use
hardwood sawdust which I get from a
sawmill. and I dry it in the sun. The
sawdust has to be sifted through a real
small screen. because snakes like to lay
their eggs in it. They‘re just little black
snakes. but the last thing I need to do
is to take snake eggs into a customcr‘s

home!

PSM: So you go to each customer‘s
home once a week?

Carney: Yes. I spend three to ﬁve
minutes at each house; at the most, ten.
It just depends. The initial cleanup
takes about 15 minutes. I had one
yesterday. I took about 35 gallons of
dog droppings out.

PSM: Thirty—ﬁve gallons? For just one
dog?

Carney: Yes, gallons! No, for two
dogs, but it was from all winter long.
The fee for the initial cleanup is a lit-
tle bit more, based on how much there
is. I learned real fast that I would go
to a place for the ﬁrst time and spend
as much as half an hour cleanup time.
and then a month later they'd quit. So
the customer got about three or four
months of free cleaning. if you think
about it. It depends though. If it‘s been
cleaned up recently. there's no initial
charge at all.

Student masters Metro

Editor ’s Note: Deborah Kaufman is a
Pitt student studying in France during
the 1986 winter term.

By Deborah Kaufman
For The Pitt News

Invariably, when visiting Paris, the
very first thing the American traveler
adapts to —~ even before thejet lag
fades — is the Metro, unless of course
he is rich enough to take taxis
everywhere. Admittedly, ridingon the
Metro has rather romantic connota-
tions. First of all, it’s in Paris, plus it’s
been immortalized in songs.

But I’m going to set you all straight.
The first several times you take the
Metro, it is fun, I’ll admit. And master-
ing the system is extremely easy. Just
pull out your handy map (available
anywhere), find the station desired,
ﬁgure out the shortest way to get there

‘ (or use the lighted machine in the sta-

tion) and hop on the nearest Metro. No
problem, n’est-ce pas?

Once you are comfortably seated,
you have the unique chance of being
entertained by any of numerous street
musicians and puppeteers. Some of
these spectacles can be quite entertain-
ing, especially if the musician has a
good sense of balance, and doesn't get

knocked over in mid-performance by
the swaying train. You may even drop
a franc or two in the ritual passing hat.

So why am I complaining about this
Parisian landmark? Frankly, after
riding the thing for the 20th time in one
day, you begin to feel like what has
been termed a “Metro Rat.” You
establish nodding acquaintances with
the bums lying in the tunnels and on
the benches and a certain odor lingers

‘in your clothes and on your person.

Another widely recognized phenom-
enon is “MF” — Metro Face. See, the
French aren’t the most personable peo-
ple in the world. They get on the train,
sit down and grab a pole to hang on to,
and they wear the “MF." You don’t
speak to anyone or look them in the
eye. You void yourself of all feeling,
compassion and love for humankind.
MF can be very effective, however, in
dealing with beggars, awful musicians
and pushy Frenchmen. You simply
keep on that blank face and deny their
very right to exist. Note that this works
off the Metro too.

Now let’s get down to the Metro
itself — the stations and trains. The sta-
tions wouldn’t be too bad if a) they
didn't house the majority of Paris’
lowlife, b) the turnstiles didn’t enjoy
the pleasure of entangling clothing,
purses, body parts, etc. and c) they
weren’t so big. Usually you have to

change trains at least once, which
means being herded up and down
stairs, escalators, moving sidewalks,
non-moving sidewalks and tunnels. It’s
enough tomake you think that it would
have been quicker to walk to your final
destination in the first place.

As far as the trains go, I have one
thing to say. You know how PAT buses
are known to have a taste for student
flesh‘? RATP (Paris’ PAT) trains are

1 worse and they don’t limit themselves
I to students, either. Once a train stops,

you have I0 seconds to get off and the
new passengers have 20 seconds to get
on. Then a buzzer sounds and the
automatic doors start to slide shut -
kind of like the steel jaws of a bear trap.
I haven’t been caught yet, but I have
witnessed the destruction that those
doors are capable of causing. One poor
woman once got an arm caught and
managed to pry it loose with the help
of a couple of strong men. Let's just
say it wasn’t a pretty sight.

So now you know the truth about the
Metro — both the good and bad. But
I haven’t told you the best pan yet.
That comes after you’ve been on the
train for 45 minutes traversing the city
Without a doubt, the very best part of
riding on the Metro is getting off the
train and walking up into the Parisian
sunshine. It's guaranteed to crack your
MF into a smile.

Roommates,relationships cause distress

By Douglas Bennett
Staff Writer

With ﬁnals just around the corner,
stress is becoming a factor in every stu-
dent's life. But for college students, ex-
aminations are not the only points of
stress in their lives. Stress from room-
mates, relationships and changing value
systems also figures into the
psychological and emotional struggle
of the college student.

In a general sense, stress is any
physical or mental reaction to a change
in enviromnent. Dr. Robert Gallagher,
director of Psychological Services at
the University Counseling and
Development Center, emphasized that
there is no one type of stressful student.

“Regardless of the stability of one's
academic and personal life," he said,
“stress can manifest itself in nearly
anyone."

If you find yourself becoming
especially jumpy, anxious, eating too
much or too little, or having a lot of
headaches, it could be the beginnings
of stress. Gallagher explained that
although these symptoms usually disap-
pear after the stressful situation is
removed, one shouldn't be afraid to
seek counseling.

The University Counseling Center
offers many services. including per-
sonal and career counseling, vocational

testing and the Learning Skills Center.
Gallagher urged anyone who is having
trouble coping to make an appointment
with a counselor. All services are free,
and the staff includes eight
psychologists, a psychiatric consultant,
two career counselors and a central
staff of four at the Learning Skills
Center.

College students in particular may
find themselves susceptible to special-
ized kinds of stress. For instance, end-
ing a long-term relationship is often a
devastating blow.

“Sure, my friends tried to help," ex-
plained Joel, a freshman political
science major, “but you can’t under-
stand unless you've been through it."

Personal relationships present an
unusual duality to those involved.
When everything else is fine, one tends
to have a wonderful outlook on life. But
as things go sour, a person’s outlook
often changes radically.

According to Dr. Kevin Bowman,
staff psychologist, the pressures of end-
ing a relationship can be tremendous.
He likened them to the death of some-
one close: One often goes through the
same stages of shock, denial, anger and
depression.

“In behavioral terms, this can mean
decreased levels of concentration, anx-
iety, not going to class or not even get-
ting out of bed." said Bowman.

But while it does take time to get
over such experiences, we often grow
as a result. Customarily, Bowman ad-

dresses these problems by allowing
students to talk over what they're
feeling.

“I like to stress to them that things
will get better,“ said Bowman. He also
noted that more females than males
seek help after ending a relationship.

“ The differences, however, may lie
in the fact that society allows women
to express their feelings more,“ he
said.

Another kind of stress almost ex-
clusive to college students is the kind
caused by their roommates. Bowman
said he finds this to be fairly common
too, and understandably so.

“We try to bring in both people,"
he explained. “Sometimes it doesn’t
work, but very often communication is
the key.”

Usually, the problems lie in the in-
dividuals’ infrastructure of values,
habits and personality. Often the first
step is to resolve the crisis; then the
roommates work out some sort of
compromise.

Larry McMasters, a junior Spanish
major, explained: “It's not that my
roommate and I were so different, but
that we were both so stubborn.“

Eventually. Larry said he resolved
his problems with the help of the
Counseling Center.

Conflicting values can also become
a major source of stress. For the first
time, students are confronted with so
much freedom and so many choices.
Exposed to so many different ideas and

individuals, it is not uncommon to find
someone struggling with his ideals.

“My friends tried pressuring me in-
to drugs and alcohol," said Maria, who
asked not to be identiﬁed. “As a result,
I lost touch with them for quite some
time. Now, though, I have their friend-
ship and their respect."

Asked how she resolved this conﬂict,
Maria said, “I went along with them
most of the time. Other times I just said
no.“ Maria’s case is a classic exam-

values into the existing framework of
old values.

It is clear that stress can appear in
many different forms. Being a univer-
sal problem, there are as many

' treatments as there are causes. “I

wouldn’t use hypnosis,“ said Bowman,
“because there are other treatments. I
might use psychotherapy [discussion],
then try to dissociate the patient from
the stress, modify the diet or recom-
nd exercise."

a fashion no—no. Pattern mixing is
more important than ever.
Elizabeth Keno. a senior com-
munications major at Pitt. models
in the Pittsburgh area. At a recent
show at Saks Fifth Avenue down-
town, Elizabeth modeled fashions
for this spring and summer season.
She claims the swimwear she
modeled was quite unique.

“The top designers are showing
a lot of unusual changes in their
swimwear lines this year.“ ex-
plained Keno. “There was a lot of
gold thread interwoven through the
suits. Sequins are popular too now.
No longer are sequins only being
seen on evening wear.” No longer
is the emphasis only on the higher
leg cut. The styles this year are
more creative and abstract than
Qen in recent years.

Elizabeth also claimed that eve-
ning wear collections for this spring
and summer are typified by exten-
sive mixtures of texture. Taffetas
with lace, silks with heavy linens
—_— almost anything goes for night-
time wear this season.

“The thing that sets this spring
and summer apart from others is
that this year the clothing is cut to
ﬂatter the female body and you
d0r_i’t have to be perfect to wear it, "
claimed Keno. The uniqueness of
these fashions is that they enhance
the individuality of the woman that
wears them.

For those of us who are

ggraduating, looking for a job is high

On the list of priorities. Alicia
Ernst, merchandising editor at
Mademoiselle. said one should ex-
ercise her personality on an inter-
view. “No one is going to
remember you at an interview
unless you do," explained Ernst.

Because women have established
themselves. we must make a state-
ment about ourselves. especially in

a fashionable way.

“Before you even open your
mouth at an interview. your clothes
should pronounce that you‘re
capable, talented and not afraid to
be yourself. I encourage being a
trend-setter. no one can take that
away from you."

However. one question still ex-
ists in the minds of most job-
oriented females: Is the conser-
vative blue suit still as essential on
an interview as your resume is?
Ernst doesn't believe that it is.
“Why not mix a sleek dress with
an oversized blazer for a change?
There are a lot or designers witn
versatile pieces that are as practical
and affordable. even for the budget-
conscious gal." claimed Ernst.
“They are a little pricier, but over-
sized blazers can be pulled out of
your cupboard season after season
and year after year and prove to be
just as practical as that conservative
blue suit so many young women
consider to be essential.”

Ernst suggested that you invest in
a few simple. yet fashionable pieces
that are versatile but not too con-
servative. The important thing on
an interview is that you make a
statement about yourself and your
individuality.

Another things that is essential
this season is the emphasis on the
“total look." You can have the
most updated clothing but if your
hair and makeup aren’t just as im-
portant as your fashion then you are
not making a complete fashion
statement.

Women will take comfort in the

fact that the emphasis this season
is on the out—of-the-shower natural
look. The quicker, the easier, the
better. So. if you are into fashion
and achieving the “total look" this
spring and summer, remember:
Have fun. stay cool and be comfor-
table in a colorful way.

your customers, or do they vary?
Carney: Absolutely not. They're black
and white, from all income brackets.
I have some customers from lower in-
come brackets, but then I have some
out in Upper St. Clair that are wealthy.
I have some right around Pitt, up
behind the Cathedral. A lot of my
business has come from flyers, and also
from word of mouth. I have one lady
that approached me and said, “Are you
a pooper scooper?“ I said yeah, and
she said she wanted me to clean her
lawn. She explained that her dog is an
inside dog, but she wants me to clean
up after everyone else's dogs that go
in her yard. She said a lot of strays,
along with her neighbors‘ dogs. are
messing up her yard, and she wants me
to clean it. In essence, she's paying me
to clean up after her neighbors‘ dogs.
I know it's bizarre, but I'm not
complaining!
PSM: I just wondered if it was prirnari-
ly wealthy customers, or if it was a real
cross section.
Carney: No, not at all. All types. Most
of my advertising is through the llyers.
which have gotten me a number of
customers, along with a crank call or
two. ()h, the crank calls are weird —
the weird calls I get! Oh boy! Well, you
can imagine!

PSM: People give you a hard time

The Pitt News, April 2, I986

about this business, then?

Carney: Well, not really a hard time.
They just give me crank calls. I can't
even repeat them; you'd have to listen
to the tapes! They're just disgusting!

PSM: How does that affect you? Are
you able to just brush it off, or does
it bother you?
Carney: No, it doesn't bother me. It's
on the machine. Some people have
called up at I a.m. and rriade some rude
comments. but I just hang up.
Anymore, I disconnect my phone after
9 p.m., and then if somebody calls, the
answering machine picks it up. I do get
weird calls though; I'd say about one
crank call for every ﬁve legitimate
calls.
PSM: Right now, then, is Scoop-D-
Doo your sole occupation? Do you still
work for the shopping centers?
Carney: Ah, well. a little bit. But I'm
mostly with Scoop-D—Doo ~ it keeps
me busy. Three days a week now are
spent with it, especially since I started
advertising over in the North Hills. It's
great because I can make my own
hours — I ﬁgure I have at least two
days I can play with. Vacation is hard
sometimes. but when I get back. the
droppings are still there, waiting for
me!
PSM: This friend of yours that initial-
ly got you interested in the idea. did
he found Poop-Van-Scoop‘?
Carney: No. no. He moved out there

six or seven years ago, and just got the
job with the company. Poop-Van-
Scoop was started by a lawyer. He
worked with them for a couple of years
and saw the money that could be made.
The closer the customers get, the more
efficiently the time can be spent. Like
yesterday, I was lost in East Liberty for
an hour, and I had to finish up over in
Brookline with a ﬂashlight. I was there
‘til 7:30 p.m. It's either that, though,
or come back a couple of days later and
finish up, so I just went in at night.

PSM: Is that what you do then, visually
look for droppings?

Carney: Yeah, oh yeah. It's there. I
can't think of any other way to find it!
A real hard thing is in the fall, when-
ever all the leaves are down, ‘cause it's
brown on brown and it's really tough.
I mean, it was really hurting my eyes
there for awhile! You really have to
look for it then! Another customer has
a yard full of buckeyes, which also
makes for some difficulty. It's weird,
I know. but these are things I have to
put up with! A strange thing is, every
time I start a new customer, they
apologize to me. because they think I'm
gonna think they're lazy. They just
don't want to do it ~ I understand. I'm
getting 21 lot oftwo dog customers now,
because the business from two dogs
really doesn't fade away!

PSM: You designed the llyers your-

self?

Carney: Yes, everything. I got the pic-
tures out of a book, but the layout and
lettering I did myself.

PSM: Where did you get the name
from?

Carney: It's called Scoop-D—Doo
because that's what I do. I scoop—d—
doo, da dog doo! I thought that was ob-
vious! It wasn't my name though; my
friend thought of it. And he thought of
“If it's on your shoe, call Scoop-D-
Doo." Poop-Van-Scoop was already
using the slogan, “We pick up where
your dog leaves off," and then my
other logo is “I'm number one in the
number two business in the number one
city." A new advertisement I'm pro-
moting says “We're the poop busters."
Little things like that make people
laugh, because it's outrageous — it's
terrible! But they take notice, and
they'll remember it!

PSM: That's great! It sounds like
ScoopD-Doo is really taking off. then.
Carney: Picking up. Pam. It's picking
up!!

PSM: Ahhhh. good one!

Carney: I get that one from my
customers! I say things like “I go out
every day and do my doo-tee!"

PSM: You're full ofthem. aren't you'.’
(‘arneyz Yeah. you could say that. I'm

full of it! I get it all day long. It's corny
I know, but it keeps me laughing!

PSM: And what's in store for the future
of Scoop-D—Doo?

Carney: Well, my sister is going to
start a Scoop-D—Doo in Columbus,
Ohio; my friend has one in Las Vegas
and I'm here in Pittsburgh. Scoop-D-
Doo is spreading out! Someday I hope
to expand to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Ft.
Lauderdale, you know, franchises.
Everybody laughed at it at ﬁrst, but my
friends aren't laughing anymore! They
haven't been on TV! At first I laughed
about it too, but then I did it, and it
went from there! Nobody‘s bothered
me yet —— in fact, most stay away from
me because they think I'm crazy!

The Pitt News, April 2, 19§_Q

By Stefanie Freliek
Staff Writer

Wee Willie Keeler used to say.
“You gotta hit ‘em where they ain’t. "
And if the Panthers had hit the ball
where the Hoyas weren't, most likely
the outcome of this past weekend's
series would have been different.

The Pitt baseball team got off to a
slow start in the Big East after losing
to Georgetown in a three-game series
this past weekend. In all three games
the Panthers made a strong showing but
couldn‘t seem to pull things together.
The three losses, by the scores of 7-6
in the first game, 8-6 in the second and
8-7 in the third, drop their record to
l-9 overall.

Pitching the ﬁrst ﬁve innings of the
first game for the Panthers was senior
Mike Sharmon, who allowed the Hoyas
two earned runs. He was relieved for
the last two innings by freshman Frank
Merigliano.

After the first inning, in which
sophomore Brian Lohman hit a home
run with Matt Stennett on ﬁrst base to
give the Panthers a two-point lead, Pitt
remained scoreless until the sixth.
There, batting the the clean—up posi-
tion, designated hitter Alex Kartsonas
hit a solo home run to tie the score at
3-3.

The Panthers scored three runs in the
last inning with right fielder Jim Leitera
driving in two of those. But it wasn’t
enough, because Georgetown came
back with four runs to cap the first

trol for the first few innings. Also, the
Panthers had begun a scoring drive. In
the first inning, first baseman Dave
Westwood walked to first. And after
stealing second, he was able to score
on a single by Brian Lohman. Team
captain Donnie Fausnaught came up to
bat and hit a single off Hoya pitching
sensation Chris Shebby to drive in
Lohman.

The next scoring drive didn’t come
until the fifth inning when Stennett
pounded a triple and Westwood added
a double to score Stennett.

Gavran yielded six runs in his 4% in-
nings. In the fifth inning, a catching
change was rriade, which Gavran thinks
may have caused him to surrender
more Hoya hits. “I seemed to be click-
ing with the catcher [John Brush] for
four innings," said Gavran. “But when
the change came, it affected my tim-
ing.”

Another change came when sopho-
more Rick Lowman took the mound in
hopes of controlling the Hoya batters.
“The team was starting to put things
together," said Lowman. “When I
came in, I just wanted to keep the score
where it was." In his 32/3 innings,
Lowman allowed three hits and struck
out three batters.

But the Panthers. ahead by two runs.
couldn't hang on to their lead. and
Georgetown racked up five more runs
and their second victory.

Pitt’s best chance of winning came
in this game. and head coach Bobby
Lewis had mixed feelings.

“It disappoints me that we couldn't
hold on," said Lewis. “But we’ve been

Georgetown sweeps weekend series

ning with a home run and got a single
in the third to drive home Jim Leitera.
Lowman scored in the sixth when
shortstop Gregg Lamanti hit a grounder
to third.

Keith Shuster and Frank Craska
combined pitching efforts in the game,
but strikeouts were non-existent, and
the Hoya batters took advantage of this.

But again the Panthers bounced back,
and in the eighth inning, after Lohman
was walked, freshman catcher Jeff
Hackett had a key play when he rapped
a single. It set the scene for catcher
John Brush to hit his double, which
drove in three runs to tie the score at
6-6. As Stennett’s double was driven
in by Al Popa, Pitt had its last score
before Georgetown pulled off two
more runs for the victory.

In retrospect, Coach Lewis found
some positive aspects in the series. “In-
cluding Florida, I think our pitching is
much improved," said Lewis. “Also,
when people were put in pressure situa-
tions they started to come through,” he
added. But Lewis can’t overlook the
lack of aggressiveness at the plate.
“We have to minimize the number of
people striking out,” said Lewis. “We
had men on base in scoring position
who didn’t get the hits."

Volunteer assistant coach Jim Del
Greco also noted, “We’re inconsistent.
Someone isn‘t taking control when
they‘re needed — but it's nothing that
can‘t be repaired."

Emphasizing the importance of
learning how to win, Lewis believes
that the Panthers will turn around their
record. “With only one senior on the

Gottfried impresses area coaches

The University of Pittsburgh believes
it has a winner in Mike Gottfried, its
30th head football coach in its proud
history, as it heads into the I986 season
and the school‘s 200th anniversary.

This will be a big year at the univer
sity and it will be a lot more fun for
all if the Panthers can bounce back
under Gottfried's direction and restore
their national reputation for ﬁelding
one of the top teams in the collegiate
ranks.

Gottfried has quickly started to make
believers out of Pittsburghers. If first
impressions mean much. Gottfried is
a good man for the challenge that is in
store.

Pete Dimperio knows something
about winning football games. and the
former Westinghouse High School
coach who dominated City League for
several decades, is just one observer
who likes what he's seen of Gottfried
to date.

Gottfried was a guest speaker at the

a much sought after clinic speaker
around the country. Gottfried’s forte is
the passing game, He was a quarter»

University, an offensive coordinator in
his early coaching days. and a fellow
with a special feel for offense. Gott-

a well—drilled, wel1—disciplined squad.
He wants everybody to get with the
program.

Gottfried had been the head coach at
Kttitsas for three seasons prior to his
l’itt assignment.

He had been a head coach previous-
l_\ at the University of Cincinnati and
Murray State University. As a college
head coach, he has compiled an eight
year Division IA record of 49-393.
and has rebuilt troubled programs at all
three stops. He has improved the
record wherever he worked. His record
last season at Kansas was 6-6.

In 1984. Gottfried was named the
Associated Press Big Eight Coach of
the Year when he posted a 5-6-1
record. including a victory over
Oklahoma, then ranked No. 2 in the na-
tion. The year before that he gained na-
tional attention with an upset of
Southern Cal.

Kansas had a 2-7-2 record the year
before Gottfried became its head coach.

At Pitt, he succeeds Serafino
“Foge" Fazio who was relieved of his
duties Nov. 24, 1985 after four seasons
(25-18-3) as head coach.

Fazio and Gottfried were assistants
at the same time at the University of
Cincinnati in 1975 and 1976.

Gottfried left Cincinnati to become
the offensive backﬁeld coach at the
University of Arizona. The year after.
Gottfried became head coach at Mur-
ray State where he went 22-ll-1 in
three seasons. Then he returned to (‘in-
cinnati and took the Bearcats, who had
been 2-9 two years in it row. to back-
to—back 6-5 marks. He did that despite

two—year period the likes of Penn State.
Pittsburgh. Florida State. South
Carolina. Alabama and Miami of
Florida.

In 1983. Gottfried's first season at
Kansas. the Jayhawks doubled their
wins from the previous year with a
4-6-1 mark.

Player of the Year Walter Berry

Cannon
aims for a
new target

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

University of Pittsburgh freshtnan
Eric Cannon from Wilmington, Del..
has achieved All-America status at the
recent NCAA Indoor Track and Field
Championships.

In the ﬁnals ofthe 55-tneter hurdles.
Cannon ﬁnished fourth in the event
with a time of 7.29. The time for Can-
non was the second fastest time he has
run.

Cannon will be competing in the
Panther Relays at Pitt Stadium on April
5. along with ﬁve other recent Pitt All-
Americas. In addition to Cannon. Pitt‘s
two—mile relay team of Bob Weiner.
Joe Daniels, Tim Manes and I)a\'e
Moore will run. as well as world record
holder Lee McRae. The relay team
finished fourth overall and McRae set
the new world record in the ﬁnals of
the 55—meter dash at Nationals.

For many freshmen. just qualifying
for Nationals is enough; for Cannon.
however. just being there was not
enough to satisfy his liking.

“For a freshman to get to that posi-
tion and respond," said Pitt track coach
John Vasvary, “is not that common of
an accomplishment. Eric went with the
idea that he was going to do something.
The way he did respond was tremen-
dous."

The new recognition for Cannon still
has the young track star somewhat
mystiﬁed. “I’m still really surprised by
my ﬁnish." said Cannon. “I’m still
waiting for the dream to end.

“The only ones not surprised were
the coaches. especially coach (Steve)
Lewis. He's helped me and worked
with me a lot. Also. the other hurdlers
on the team have been a great in-
fluence." said Cannon. “Now I'vejust
got to go out there and keep working
to go farther."

Pitt players learning discipline

A few thoughts more freshening than
the turn of the weather:

0 Pitt football players are learning
the meaning of discipline. New coach
Mike Gottfried has the spring practice
sessions looking more like boot camp
in the Marines. But I haven't heard
anyone complaining, yet —-~ except of
course for running back Brian Davis
who was promptly suspended.

At one of the early practices, a cou-
ple of offensive linemen walked to the
line of scrimmage only to quickly
discover that they will not jog, sprint
or stroll, but run while on the football
field.

0 Pitt basketball players will soon be
getting a dose of discipline like their
football counterparts are getting
presently. The choice of Paul Evans as
Roy Chipman‘s successor was a
brilliant one. Some Pitt players will be
shocked. but will find it worthwhile
when they realize it takes a little team
work to win a few basketball games.
Jerome Lane  do you read me‘?

0 Teamwork is important  ask the
Louisville Cardinals. When I witnessed
a game at Louisville seven games into
the season. the Cardinals showed
worlds of talent, but couldn‘t play
together. Louisville needed a ball on
the court for every player as they
struggled to a 4-3 mark. But head coach

Denny Crum did something Chipman
couldn't do. C rum molded the talent in-
to a team — a team good enough to win
the national championship.

0 Look for Louisville center Pervis
Ellison to be a force in college basket-
ball the next few seasons. He put on
a show in Monday's championship
game against top—ranked Duke despite
being a freshman. Ellison scored 25
points and pulled down a number of
key offensive rebounds in a pressure
cooker where seniors usually play the
lead role. With Ellison in the lineup for

Randy Miller

another three years, you can bet the
ranch that the Cardinals will have a
good shot at winning another cham-
pionship. Ellison has everything it takes
to be a superstar.

0 There won't be any baseball cham—
pionships in Pittsburgh for a while. but
Jim Leyland has the club looking good.
After a slow start in the grapefruit
league. the Pirates have played con-
sistently sound baseball the past cou-
ple of weeks. The Pirates have a lot of
young sticks in the lineup and a few
young pitching prospects. Tony Pena

and Johnny Ray will get some offen-
sive support from outfielders R. J.
Reynolds and Mike Brown. Pittsburgh
has the nucleus to build a good team.
It will take time. however. The Pirates
will not contend for the National
League East title this year. but you can
be sure they will be an exciting team
to watch.

Here’s a couple early baseball
predictions to take in. In the National
League. the New York Mets will win
the East. and Chuck Tanner‘s Atlanta
Braves the West. The Mets are strong
at every position and have Cy Young
Award winner Dwight (iooden on the
hill. The Braves already had the best
player in the game in slugging out-
fielder l)aIe Murphy. Now they have
the best manager in Tanner. If you give
Tanner some talent. he'll win for you.

and the Braves have their share of

talent.

0 While the Penguins will probably
not make the playoffs. for the first time
in their history. they appear to have a
bright future. Mario Lemieux is no
longer a one—man team. (leneral
Manager Fxldie Johnston has developed
a pretty good minor-league system and
it is starting to pay off. And the eve
Penguin head coach has made a cou-
ple of smart trades. namely picking up
hardworking winger Ron Duguay

Gottfried’s recruits primarily skill players

When Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
assumed control of the football pro-
gram, his first priority was to hit the

the time lost between the ﬁring of Foge

The Pitt News, April 2, 1986

Pitt’s Stottlemyer named

Coaches Bob Bubb of Clarion and
Randc Stottlemyer of Pitt were voted
Co-coaches of the Year in the Eastern
Wrestling League by their fellow
coaches and a panel from the media.
It marked the ﬁrst time since the incep-
tion of the award that there has been
a tie. ,4

Bubb's Golden Eagles turned in a
brilliant dual meet season with a record
of 17-0-1, good enough to earn them
a No. 3 ranking in the national poll and
tie them for the No. 1 slot in the ﬁnal
Eastern Mat Poll with Penn State.
Bubb's team snapped Penn State’s
domination in the Eastern Wrestling
League by wrestling the Nittany Lions
to a 21-21 tie in their dual meet which
also gave the Golden Eagles a share of
the EWL regular season title.

Meanwhile, Pitt's Stottlemyer guid-
ed the Panthers to one of their best
seasons since joining the Eastern
Wrestling League. Pitt racked up a
9-3-2 dual meet mark. The Panthers
were tied by both Lehigh and
Cleveland State. The Panthers’ ﬁnest
hour came at the recent NCAA cham-
pionships at the University of Iowa.

Stottlemyer had only two qualiﬁers
in Kyle Nellis at 134 pounds and
freshman Pat Santoro at 142 pounds.
Both wrestled exceptionally well and
placed at their respective weight
classes. Nellis was eighth, ‘while San-
toro took a sixth which gave the Pan-
thers 13 team points and 25th place.
The l3 points is a Pitt high.

Coach Bubb said, “I'm delighted to
share the award with Coach Stot-
tlemyer. He did a superb job with the
talent he had on hand. I was really im-
pressed with the way his two-man
squad wrestled at the NCAAs. He

I A PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE FROM
THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

deserves to be our Coach of the Year. ”

Meanwhile, Stottlemyer pointed out,
“We may have had a winning dual
meet season and an outstanding NCAA
Tournament, but I felt both Coach
Bubb and Coach Roger Sanders of
Bloomsburg deserved to win this
award. However, I’m delighted to
know that the people voting on this
award would recognize what my staff
and team accomplished here at Pitt."

While Clarion didn't perform up to
its ability in the NCAA Tournament,
the Golden Eagles enjoyed one of their
ﬁnest dual campaigns ever, defeating
the likes of Oklahoma State, Wiscon-
sin, Michigan and Syracuse. They also
romped to a Pennsylvania Conference
tournament title, while ﬁnishing second
in the EWL Championships and send-
ing eight qualiﬁers to the nationals, a
team high.

Capping the season for Clarion was
its tie for a share of the No. 1 spot with
Penn State in the Eastern Mat Poll. Pitt
ﬁnished a surprising ﬁfth, one of its
highest ﬁnishes in years.

Jim Martin of Penn State was voted
the Eastern Wrestling League’s
Freshman of the Year by a panel of the
media and the loop’s coaches.

The fonner three-time Pennsylvania
state champion from Danville, Pa.,
turned in a sensational season. He rolled
up a 6-0 mark in the EWL in dual
meets and ﬁnished second in the tour-
nament behind two-time NCAA cham-
pion Rick Bonomo of Bloomsburg. He
compiled an overall record of 37-4.

It was at the NCAA championships
that Martin really proved his ability. He
bowed in the semi—ﬁnals to Bonomo.
but came back to ﬁnish fourth. the
highest by any EWL freshman. He was

,.EWL co-Coach of the Year

seeded fourth, which is also the highest
by a frosh from the EWL.

Martin established a scoring mark
for freshmen for the EWL in the
NCAAs by collecting 13 points. He

— became only the third freshman from

the EWL to garner All-America laurels
until Pitt’s Pat Santoro took a sixth after
him.

What was more remarkable about
Martin during the season was he was
only taken down seven times until his
confrontations with Bonomo.

It marks the third straight year a
freshman from Penn State has been
voted one of the Eastern Wrestling
League's top post-season awards. Ken
Chertow captured the honor last year,
while two-time All-America and EWL
champion Greg Elinsky was the reci-
ient in 1984.

Meanwhile, also receiving votes was
Pitt’s Santoro who also garnered All-
America honors in the recent NCAA
championships by ﬁnishing sixth at 142
pounds.

Penn State coach Rich Lorenzo said,
“Jim was an exceptional ﬁrst-year
wrestler. He demonstrated that he has
the potential to become an outstanding
performer here at Penn State. If it
wasn't for Bonomo who knows how far
Jim could have gone. Jim has a taste
of the NCAA tournament and he knows
now what it will take in the future to
become a national champion.“

Here’s the previous winners of the
EWL Freshman of the Year:

1980 -— Steve Jastrabek, Clarion
1981 — Steve Sefter, Penn State
1982 — Doug Haines, Pitt

1983 —— Nate Carter. Clarion
1984 — Greg Elinsky. Penn State
1985 — Ken Chertow. Penn State
1986 — Jim Martin. Penn State

Panthers host

Today is the Panthers’ first home
game after being on the road for the
first 10 games of the season. The Pan-
thers are hoping to have better luck at
home than they’ve had on the road. Pitt
is currently 1-9, with the lone victory
being in the season opener against
Brooklyn College. The Panthers then
went on to lose single games to Ten-
nessee Tech and Bradley University.
The slump continued as they dropped
four games to No. 1 ranked Florida
State and three to Big East opponent
Georgetown.

Senior captain Don Fausnaught is
currently leading the Panthers’ attack
at the plate. The second baseman has
started in all 10 of the Panthers’ games
and has a batting average of .346. In
Big East stats he is also leading the
team with a .625 average, which is sec-
ond in the conference. Fausnaught has
two doubles, one home run and six
RBIs to his credit.

Sophomore Brian Lohman is on a hot
streak also. The left ﬁelder has a .343
batting average and leads the team in
home runs with two, RBIs with seven,
hits with 12 and is tied with center-
fielder Matt Stennett with five doubles
and one triple. On the base path, soph-
omore Dave Westwood has a team high
four stolen bases. Jim Leitera is second
in stolen bases with two. Leitera has
a strong series against Georgetown and
came away with a .500 Big East bat-
ting average. ranking him eighth in the

conference.

The Panthers‘ pitching staff has had
its trouble in the early going. In 10
games, Pitt has given up 87 runs. 76
of them earned for a team—earned run
average of 7.60. The Panthers have
given up 97 hits and 73 walks, with on-
ly 39 strikeouts. Sophomore Rich
Gavran is the team leader with a 4.07
ERA. In Big East action sophomore
Rich Lowman is in the lead with a 1.91
ERA, which ranks him 10th in the
conference. ‘

Some of the newcomers on the Pan-
thers’ roster have made some early
contributions to the team. Since
transferringto Pitt from CCAC-South,
John Brush has taken over for the Pan-
thers behind the plate. While he has
provided the team with excellent defen-
sive skills, he has also made strong
contributions at the plate. He is current-
ly batting .300, with four RBIs, one of
them being the game winner against
Brooklyn College. Bill Osborn has
been splitting his spring between base-
ball and football and has done well as
a starter at third base. He is currently
hitting .238. Alan Poap has played a
key role as a backup at second and has
turned in some real defensive gems. He
is also strong at the plate with a .400
average. On the mound, freshman
Frank Mcrigliano has been strong
pitching relief in three games. He has
an overall ERA of 6.18, with a 3.50
Big East ERA.
