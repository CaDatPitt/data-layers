Pitt Officials 'Optimistic'

Shapp Will Approve Aid      

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer
Provost Rhoten Smith expressed

“cautious optimism” that the
proposed ﬁve percent increase in
state appropriations would be

approved by Governor Shapp
within the next 10 days.

Speaking before the Senate
Council on behalf of Chancellor
Posvar, on an educational ex-
change tour of ‘the Far East, Smith
said the non-preferred budget,
passed by both the House and
Senate, is currently before Shapp.

“From Harrisburg we have
received a sort of cautious

optimism that Governor Shapp

intends to sign the bill with the
increases suggested by the Legisla-
ture,” Smith said.

Smith added that the approval of
a $210 million ﬁscal budget at last
month’s annual Board of Trustees
meeting in Johnstown rested
entirely on the $25 tuition increase
levied and the hopes of receiving a

larger amount from the Legislature
and the Governor.

Other budgetary items on the
agenda included those considered
by the State under the general fund
(unlike the preferred fund, which
encompasses the state-related uni-
versities). The general fund re-
ceived a striking blow in Shapp’s
$71 million veto, which is expected
to be challenged by a veto override
bill from the Legislature in the near
future.

Smith cited several of Pitt's
afﬁliated institutions that would be
adversely affected by the veto.
They include the Cerebral Disfunc-
tion Center, which receives a yearly
appropriation of $25,000 from the
general fund, the Pittsburgh Cleft
Palate Center ($30,000) and the
Arsenal Family Center, which
would be forced to close its doors
altogether if denied state appropri-
ations.

‘In other business, Smith re-
ported the outcome of last week’s

Budgets

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board (SGB) passed the recom-
mended budgets for its seven
standing committees during special
allocation hearings Saturday. The
funds for the committees total more
than $64,000, a slight drop from last
year.

The board at the same time
returned allocation recommenda-
tions for all student clubs and
organizations to Allocations Com-
mittee for revision. SGB members
speciﬁcally suggested changes in
allocations for the Pitt Hockey Club,
Pitt Hillel Club, the Black
Engineering Council, the Anti-
Imperialist Student Union, the

Irish, American Folk Music Highlight 'Smoky City‘ Festival

By CHERYL PASTORIUS

Sunshine, diversity and an informal atmosphere marked the second
annual Smoky City Folk Festival in Oakland last weekend.

A series of music and ﬁlm workshops were held in the Pitt Student
Union Saturday, followed by entertainment Sunday afternoon at

Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park.

Guitar, banjo playing, a program featuring British ballads and
clogg1ng—a dance similar to square dancing—highlighted Saturday's

activities.

Several wooden instruments such as xylophones and dulcimers were
on display on the Student Union porch. Among those demonstrating
instruments was Bob Hutchinson, maker and seller of Appalachian
dulcimers (stringed instruments played on the lap) in Wexford.

“This instrument gives a lyrical, acoustic sound,” Hutchinson said.
“They’ve been revived in the last 25 years, and they were developed
here in the 18th century to imitate bagpipes.”

Other events Saturday included storytelling, a banjo workshop and
square dancing——complete with a live band.

Perhaps the most enjoyable event was the percussion workshop, at

Senate Hearing

Cancer Research Faces ‘Credibility Crisis’

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON - The war on
cancer, ofﬁcially declared in 1970
and lavishly funded since then, has
hunted unsuccessfully for cures
while virtually ignoring prevention,
researchers told a Senate panel
yesterday.

The witnesses noted that the
National Cancer Institute ‘(NCI)
budget has increased fourfold
during this decade to more than
$800 million in the last fiscal year,
with further increases expected.

Dr. Theodore Cooper, dean of
Cornell Univeristy Medical Col-
lege, said cancer research “now
faces a crisis of credibility.”

“People are asking why, after
seven years of magniﬁcent efforts,
have we ‘ not conquered those

fearful diseases that we call cancer.
Why have we spent such a small
percentage of resources on nutri-
tional and environmental activi-
ties? Why so little on prevention?”
he asked.

The questions were posed in
testimony to the Senate nutrition
subcommittee.

When the war on cancer was
declared, scientists were conﬁdent
that a massive federal effort could
conquer cancer. They said what
was needed was an effort compar-
able to that of the space program.

When former President Nixon
signed the legislation Dec. 23, 1971,
he called it “a Christmas gift to the
American people.” '

The witnesses said yesterday

that the issue then was whether to

set up a greatly expanded cancer
program, not on where the money
should be spent within cancer
research.

“None of the major scientiﬁc or
clinical areas of cancer research
were considered in any detail in the
legislative debate,” testiﬁed Rich-
ard A. Rettig, senior social scientist
for the Rand Corporation and
author of a book on enactment of
the National Cancer Act of 1971.

Peggy C. Fry, a University of
Texas nutritionist, said the Nation-
al Cancer Institute has funded
much research into possible cancer
cures with relatively little money
for prevention through good
nutrition and other ways.

“I feel ‘strongly that nutrition

research is consciously ignored by
NCI,” she said.

NCI Director Arthur Upton is
scheduled to testify to the
subcommittee today.

Dr. George L. Blackburn of
Harvard Medical School, a leading
cancer researcher, said there is a
traditional emphasis on treating
diseases rather than preventing
them. He noted that in 1976 only 19
of the country’s 114 medical
schools required courses in nutri-
tion.

“The decision-making forums at
NIH, where allocation of research
dollars occurs, are dominated by
graduates of these medical schools;
that is, physicians who have little if
any formal training in nutrition

ON THE SIXTH DAY
BY DAVID N. CAMPBELL

ON THE SIXTH DAY is the first
novel of a forthcoming trilogy
about the first humans who made
their way across the African savan- :
na. The epic of their survival
reveals the first moments of con-
sciousness, the formation of
society, the beginnings of language
and religion.

David Campbell’s story of The
People, of AHEE and SHE,
provides us with not only a com-
passionate but a factual link to our
own history for ON THE SIXTH
DAY is based on the researched
notions of several anthropologists,
Louis Leakey and Robert Ardrey
among them. Simply, told, this first
of three books is provocative,
erotic, frightening and tender.

THE STEEL CITY STAR is
distributed by Triangle News and can
be purlrased at most major newsstands
and ofﬁce buildings. In Oakland,

this discrepancy was because of the

“This is supportive of economic

Smith said. “This indicates that we
arelin a very positive position to
move forward from here.”

The subject of academic eligibil-
ity for student athletes was raised
by Senate Athletic, Committee
chairman William Rudoy. Rudoy
issued a» report that included the
criteria set by his committee to
judge an athlete's eligibility to

~ participate in any University-

sanctioned interscholastic sport.

The report stated that, to be
considered eligible by the Senate
Athletic Committee (the governing
body that ﬁnalizes all rulings on
eligibility), a student athlete must
complete 24 credits by the end of
his or her ﬁrst academic year of
study, 50 by the end of the second
year and 80 by the end of the third
(with one academic year including
the spring term).

These students must also main-
tain a minimum grade point
average of 1.80 for the ﬁrst two
years and a 1.9 during the third
year.

Rudoy outlined other ways in
which student athletes may have
their ﬁnancial assistance revoked.
These include: withdrawl from the
sport; suspension from the Uni-
versity; and violation of a regula-
tion governing any of the athletic
associations afﬁliated with the Uni-
versity, such as the NCAA.

Rudoy stressed that guidelines
for academic eligibility required by

Tuesday, June 13, 1978—THE PITT N EWS.—-Page 3

State Aid Topic At Council Meeting  

Pitt are much more stringent than
those of the NCAA.

- A question from the floor
centered on the number of student
athletes who actually graduate
after expiration of their eligibility.

“The question should be dealt
with more on the basis of ﬁve years
rather than the number of four-year
graduates we have,” Rudoy said.
“Many of our athletes must cut
their academic load, something
that can be compared to an
engineering student working part
time who is often urged to ease off
on the number of credits carried.”

In the student report to Council,
Student Government Board presi-
dent Josh Baylson asked for
approval of a resolution that would
give all undergraduates the after-
noon of October 20 (the Friday
preceeding (Homecoming weekend)
dismissed from classes.

The request was met by strong
opposition by faculty members who
claimed that to dismiss classes on
this day would violate the primary
teaching purposes of the Univer-
sity. ‘

Vice Chancellor Jack Freeman
offered an alternative resolution,
which called for a memorandum to
be issued to all undergraduate
faculty members asking that they
decrease the workload for that day
on a voluntary basis. This was
received unanimously by Baylson
and Council members.

Accountability

Annual Student Government Board (SGB) budget figures are
elusive creatures. If one inquires at the SGB office about the
predicted budget totals during the middle of the allocation process,
he is bound to get the runaround. The SGB secretary says she
doesn’t have those figures, and suggests that the SGB adviser
might be able to help/.ﬂUnfortunately, it seems the adviser does not
have the information on total expected allocations either.

In fact, no one seems to have that information. Allocations for
every separate club, standing SGB committee and goverance group
are prepared separately. No one bothers to tabulate the totals of
these allocations until the later stages of budgeting. Because
allocations are compiled this way, curious students must leaf
through almost 60 documents to find how SGB is spending their ac-
tivities fees.

To give any meaning to these figures, students must have past
SGB spending records, but those documents are even more inac-
cessible. After the allocations process, SGB buries every
organization’s budget request in its files. Therefore, one must go
through the files of 60 odd clubs, committees and goverance groups
to find where Student Government has spent students’ money in
past years.

Since SGB’s primary responsibility is dispersing the ap-‘

proximately $250,000 in activities fees it receives each year, its
allocation process should be completely visible to the students who
pay $12 a term into SGB coffers. With the existing accounting
process, the budgeting procedure is far from visible. This in-
visibility can prevent students from keeping elected board members
accountable for their decisions.

Several amazingly simple steps could make budget information
more easily accessible. The allocation committee could be required
to compile a budget showing the past year’s allocation, the
requested allocation and the recommended allocation for all groups
funded by SGB. This budget could also include expected SGB
revenues. If copies of this budget were available to all students in
the SGB office a. week before any allocations hearings, students‘
could easily check to see whether their funds are spent wisely.

Staff Unionization and Rising Tuition

The Pitt News cries “our tuition
will go up,” so save us and the Pitt
staff from the ravages of unioniza-
tion. “We can’t learn in a selﬁsh
environment!” it claims. Poor Pitt
News. No, the Pitt staff isn’t
“living in poverty” but let’s see you

try raising three kids on eight '

thousand dollars a year.

»It’s easy for people like you to sit
back and say “come on Pitt staff, do
without, let your kids do without,
give in, compromise—-just don’t let
our tuition rise.’ ’ I doubt any of you
are looking forward to an eight-

thousand-dollar-a-year job, but are
looking into the double-ﬁgures jobs
and dreaming of the triple-figures
jobs—and you say the Pitt staff is
selﬁsh for wanting a decent—not
exhoribitant—living wage.

Yes, Pitt News, our tuition is
going up, but I think it has little to
do with the organizational efforts of
the Pitt staff. Maybe you haven’t
noticed, buttuition has been rising
steadily the past years-when Pitt
paid their staff worse. I think the
answer to why our tuition has been
going up will probably be found on

the Board of Trustees——made up of
big banks and corporations mem-
bers who aren’t the least bit worried
about tuition at Pitt and wouldn’t
send their kids here anyway. Your
brilliant solution about “distribu-
tion of income” probably leaves the
greatest economists jealous, and

The Jarvis-Gann Amendment,

The time has come to call a spade
a spade; the time has come to face

facts: the American people are

stupid. ‘

And more than just a couple are
In any collection of more
than 200 million people one could
reasonably expect some to be of
lesser intelligence than others.
However, the point is, that large
masses of Americans are stupid. -

This argument isn’t spurred by a
dissatisfaction with current election
results; nobody can will them all.
The argument here has two points.

First, Americans have demon-
strated a complete refusal or a total
inability to intelligently analyze
issues and reach a logical con-
clusion. Second, they have demon-
strated an absolutely incredible
ability to deﬁne what they feel is
their own best self-interest, then go
out and take an action speciﬁcally

appfoved in California last week, is
probably the best example. That
amendment reduces all property
taxes in California to one percent _of
assessed value as of 1975-1976. It
will cut between $6 billion and $7
billion a year from the tax revenues
of local California municipalities.
The goal of the amendment,
according to its sponsors, was to
reduce the size of the state
budget—an amusing notion in light
of the fact that the state is the only
governmental entity in California to
have its revenues largely untouched
by the passage of J arvis-Gann.

It is the California cities and
counties that got butchered. They
lost up to two-thirds of their income.
This is not income that goes to pay

paramedic units. San Francisco is
facing the loss of 40 percent of its
education budget and the closing of

for paradise on the Paciﬁc.

At no point did the supporters of
Jarvis-Gann determine that the
local municipalities could afford to
lose $6 billion to $7 billion a year
over an extended period of time. At
no point did they even-try to make
that determination.

Opponents of the amendment
argued that the way to reduce a
budget is to analyze it, see where
cuts can be made, and make them.
The J arvis-Gann approach, they
said, is like throwing the baby out
withthe bath water. Unfortunately,
theirs is a two-step process, and the
Jarvis-Gann one-step is so much
easier. Besides, examining the
budget before cutting it requires
some thought andeeffort. Jarvis-

thing a couple weeks ago.

Another example of American
stupidity took place in Ohio last
week. All across the country people
are upset because their kids aren’t
learning anything in school. (One
could make the like-father-like-son
argument, but that’s the easy way
out.) The citizens of Cleveland,
Columbus and other communities
came up with a novel solution to the
problem. They refused to give the
schools the money they need to
operate.

This is not to say that tax
increases for school systems
automatically lead to better educa-
tion, but if it is decided to be in

‘ one’s best self-interest for children

to know how to read, then it is
completely irrational to force the
schools to close because of a lack of
money. That is taking an action
designed to defeat one’s own
self-interest.

Pennsylvania voters did the same
They

I self-interest to have a state attorney

general who was free from politics.
So what did they do? They went out
and created a situation that in order
to be attorney general one must
solicit campaign contributions,
build a political machine, deal with

political county chairmen and

develop a political patronage
system. In short, one must be a
politician.

That’s stupid. (And let’s not even
discuss how a couple hundred-
thousand people could vote for one
candidate, thinking they were
voting for someone else just
because he had the same name-
resulting in a candidate for
Lieutenant Governor no one had

he has to run. That kind of stupidity
is too massive for a mere mortal to
comprehend.) P
Webster’s Seventh Collegiate
Dictionary deﬁnes stupid as “lack-
ing in intelligence or reason.”
Given that general deﬁnition, along
with the examples in this article,
recent events all too well prove that
American people are stupid.

And what about the future? There /
are, and willbe, candidates runnin 

for high office on a platform of
cutting spending without regard to
whether that spending is valuable
or wasteful. There will be Jarvis-
Gann amendments in many other
states, offering voters the oppor-
tunity to protect their invest-
ment in their property while
abolishing the ﬁre department,
which is necessary to help protect
that investment. ,

The American people are stupid.
But maybe, just maybe, they are not

so stupid not to realize what they 

are doing and change their ways. It
would be nice to see an article

Kennedy’s Children
by Robert Patrick
Directed by Tom Crawley

It’s a pleasure to see a
production transcend the play,

particularly a play such as
“ Kennedy’ s Children . ’ ’
The children in “Kennedy’s

Children” are not the biological
offspring of John F. Kennedy, but
ﬁve characters who now, on a rainy
Valentine’s Day in 1974, ﬁnd
themselves caught in the indiffer-
ence of the 1970’s—thrusting them
back to the “spirit of the ’60s.”

The message is /that it wasn’t (a
day of wine and roses. The
characters are experiencing stasis
horrors, the fear of coming to a
stop.

They are a strange group to be
propelled together: a Vietnam
veteran now on methadone treat-
ments; a prim magazine paste-up
editor moonlighting as a teacher of
“subnormal” children; a washed-
up, gay, off-off-Broadway actor; a
inherit
Marilyn Monroe’s place as cultural

~sex-goddess; and a spent-out

activist with some ﬁght left in her.
Everyone has a story to tell and
the American gathering point for
just that—a place where people can
cry into their beers—is the bar.

In “Kennedy’s Children,” the

most part, toward the audience;
they don’t speak with, or to, each
other. The passivity, verbal and

The Last Waltz
Directed by Martin Scorsese

It is no surprise that Martin

Scorsese’s “The Last Waltz” is no '

waltz at all, but a vibrant, very
electricgsalute to The Band. Had
they called it “The Last Band,”
“The Last Litany,” or “The’Last
Wazoo,” it would still possess the
power and vitality that make it a
vintage concert ﬂick.

 
 

 A ﬁlm of this genre must stand or
' on the merits of the concert; this

one stands, jumps, shouts and gets
down to some of the premier
performances of our time.

The concert is the 1976 farewell
performance of The Band at Bill
Graham's Wonderland in Los
Angeles. An entourage of major
and minor luminaries from the
ﬁelds of jazz, country, rock and soul
music joins The Band for a revival of
American music of the past 20
years.

Opening with “Up on Cripple

on the road. Then, Ronnie

otherwise, of the characters toward
each other is akin to the alienation
of modern man.

But the production transcends
the play’s own mediocrity. Director
Tom Crawley and the actors have

taken a tangled skein of mono-

logues and woven a painful
exhibition of characters confronted
with their own fallibility.

Within David Ferguson’s multi-
leveled set, the actors move in, out

called The Hawks, enters for an
outrageous rendition of “Who Do
You Love.” By the time Neil Young
contributes his “Helpless” the
celebration is in full swing.

fnterspersed with concert footing
are short interviews with The Band
members. -These small vignettes
reveal much about their personali-
ties, careers and music. Anecdotes
are of the early days—shoplifting in
supermarkets, turning over ciga-
rette machines for smokes—surviv-
ing on the road. Levon Helms is the
most articulate about their music,
its roots and purpose, but Robbie
Robertson speaks most about the
members themselves.

Robertson exudes a street-
toughened sensuality, reminiscent
of Mick Jagger. He seems to be the
mentor of the group, the driving
force behind their success, and he
even looks somewhat like his
counterpart in the Stones. His
personality is marred by egotism,
yet it is understandable and
forgivable. ‘

When asked why The Band is
quitting the road, he tells of the
trials and “Trivialations” brought
on by the adulations of the fans. He
then recites a litany of great
musicians, taken by the road,

small furtive glances. This is, at
least, a small, human touch, which
the play itself avoids.

The actors move with gestures

But the weariness of road life is
best portrayed by the haunting
strains of “Stage Fright,” sung by
Rick Dando, and Robertson’s terse
statement: ‘ ‘I couldn’t even discuss
20 years on the road.”

As the celebration continues, Neil

out toward the audience and
painfully in toward himself. The
role, shallowest when read, doesn’t
carry Brunetti; he carries the role.
The most believable character
(perhaps because we are not yet
overly familiar with the Vietnam
veteran-as-character), Mark
(Charles Coker), becomes the
weakest. Coker reads the unset
letters for his mother and his diary
entries in a loud monotone as if
they were newspaper articles-
something HE had not written.

And while the dialogue reﬂects
some kind of change in the
character (caused either by drugs
or a growing sense of self-aware-
ness spurred by his spiritual
adviser and veteran buddy, Chick),
Coker’s acting doesn’t change; he
only gets louder to the point that it
becomes unnerving to listen to
him. His lack of stage movement is
too violently contrasted with the
other cast members.

Even when Herring’s incredibly
energetic ﬂower child, Gayle,
walks she marches. Patrick, how-
ever, has burdened her with a
character that has become cliche,—
the idealistic, inconsistent political
youth. “During the day we sold the
lowest priced acid on the street and
at night worked at the drug
rehabilitation center,” she tells the
audience.

The character possesses a naive
dialogue that enables many to
jokingly dismiss any sincerity in the
anti-war movement (or any move-
ment for that matter), to laughingly
dispell Gandhian non—violent re-
sistence. '

constantly revolves around JFK
and his assasination. Tannenbaum
creates a real, sadly obsessive
character who seems most real
when she gently moves around
stage, talking with the audience.
She is extraordinarily painful when
confronted with her retarded
students, who have never heard of

Kennedy, and have never heard of g

her.
Debra Gordon’s portrayal of a
woman who beautifully desired to

be a sex goddess—not a human ‘

being-—becomes pathetic when she
ﬁnds herself so much like 15
million (her count) other women
possessed with the same dream.
She becomes lost to the point of
death.

Then there is Jim Malloy’s silent
but all the more present bartender.
Malloy is never burdened by the
actors, nor does he burden them.
He is never the recipient of
dialogue, never the unbendable
ear. But he knows. He looks and he
knows.

“Kennedy’s Children” exists in
the past tense. The characters look
back, not forward, lost in the
changes: the faddish popularity of
outrageous theater; the end of
Vietnam but not of the ex-soldier;
the demise of active political
activism; the prevalence of sex
symbols (Raquel Welsh and drag
queens); and the burning off of the
misty Camelot-Kennedy days.

Although the play itself lacks any
alchemical transformation, within a
very unsubtle and discompassion-
ate play, the actors subtly change.
It is a play in which joy doesn’t
exist in its lexicon.

Football ls a Full- Time Proposition for Panther Hopefuls

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Although it’s three months
Panther defensive end
Randy Johnson is already thinking

about the coming football season.

Johnson, presently tabbed a
back-up to incumbent Dave DiCic-
cio, is quick to point out that
football is a year-round proposition
for the Panthers.

“Most people think when the
season’s over, we forget about
football—but we don’t,” Johnson
‘said. “Although we may not do
things as a team in the spring or
summer, we do things as indi-
viduals to get ready, like watching

Weightlifting and weight gaining

Harris’

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Thelnames Bill Willoughby,
Larry McNeil], Chuck Williams and
Bird Averitt took on a new meaning
for Pitt’s Larry Harris some 72

picks after the NBA draft began in

New York last Friday.

Harris, drafted by the Buffalo
Braves in the fourth round, will
likely ﬁnd this quartet the major
obstacles in his path to joining
former ‘Panther Billy Knight for a
winter in Buffalo, Dallas, or
wherever the Braves ﬁnd them-
selves for the start of the 1978
season.

Buffalo, which ﬁnished last in
the NBA Eastern Division last
season, has a new coach, Cotton
Fitzsimmons, some proven NBA
talent in Billy Knight. Randy
Smith, Marvin Barnes and Swen
Nater and little else.

Because of the physical nature of
the inside game in the NBA, Harris
would be better suited for
backcourt duty with the Braves
(instead of the small forward he
played in college), provided his
ball-handling capabilities are up to
the ‘test.

Mike Glenn, who was a starting
guard for Buffalo with Smith,
became a free agent and has since
signed with the New York Knicks,
creating a natural vacancy in the
backcourt. Williams, 6-3, averaged
7.3 points a game last season on
two injured knees, and Averitt is a
6-2 guard who has shown ﬂashes of
brilliance in his career.

Willoughby and McNeill com-
bined for 18 points and nine
rebounds a game last year but will
be relegated to the bench with
Knight’s return from knee surgery.

Despite the fact that the Braves
are in a transition year with a new

account ror most of his physical
preparation (much to the envy of
the weightwatcher, Johnson can
eat nearly everything in sight
without putting on weight). He
hopes the combination of large
amounts of food mixed with the
construction job lined up for later
this summer will add some bulk to
his 6-3, 216 pound frame to better
withstand the block of 260-pound
offensive linemen.

“It’s pretty much taken for
granted that DiCiccio will start,”
Johnson said. “But, even though I
won’t start, I still have to be
prepared. You have to know your
assignments whether you start or

not.
“Look at Steve Fedell,” he

coach already signed and a new
owner a distinct possibility, there
seem to be six players on the
present roster with a reserved
space in Fitzsimmons’ plans.

Knight, Smith (the winner of the .

MVP award in last year’s all-star
game), Barnes (if his problems
with the law don’t dictate other-
wise), Willoughby (a 6-8 forward
drafted by the Atlanta Hawks out of
high school), Averitt and Nater. ~
Buffalo’s ﬁrst choice was Mar-
quette’s 6-10 Jerome Whitehead in
the second round, and those people
customarily receive no-cut con-
tracts. Mike Santos of Utah State,
Ricky Galloon of Louisville, Marvin
Delph of Arkansas and ‘White-
head’s teammate Jim" Boylan were
selected in the third round.
Gallon is expected to play center;
Santos could be a forward out of the
mold of Seattle’s Jack Sikma, and
Delph reportedly signed a contract
with Athletes in Action.
Assuming that the four rookies
make the team, which is unlikely,

Harris would be one of the top ﬁve‘

candidates for the remaining two
spots_on the final roster.

Harris, Pitt’s all-time scoring
leader, has put on some unbeliev-
able shows at the Field House and
should be a more than legitimate
contender if the intensity shown in
the Eastern Eight tournament also
makes the trip" to Buffalo.

It is difficult to imagine someone
with Harris’s scoring ability not
making the Braves over some of the
less heralded players to take a shot
at pro basketball. On the other
hand, since Bill Sharman of the Los
Angeles Lakers had never heard of
Harris the morning of the draft,
maybe Larry also falls into that
category.

Sports

continued. “When Dave (DiCiccio)
was hurt last season, he stepped
right in and did a good job. He
couldn’t have had any idea he
would start, but he was ready.”
Although he entered the 1977 fall
camp as a second-term defensive
end, Johnson only dressed for the
ﬁrst two games (Notre Dame and
William and Mary) before accept-
ing a redshirt and watching
freshmen Fedell and Ricky Jackson
admirably ﬁll in when DiCiccio

  I

missed several games with a hand
injury.

It doesn’t bother Johnson that
Fedell and Jackson leapfrogged
ahead of him.

“I don’t think it’s worth it to sit
back and complain,” Johnson said.
“I know a lot of players in a similar
position would sit back and say,
‘hey, I want my spot back, or I
won’t play again.’ But I don’t want
to do that. E

“I didn’t really know how to take
the redshirt at first,” he continued.
“But, then, I talked it over‘ with a
couple guys on the team and they
told me not to worry about it.

“Al Chesley told me it was a
compliment. He made me realize
that if they didn’t want me, they

wouldn’t be giving me an extra
year of free education. They
wouldn’t keep me around for the
extra year if they didn’t think I
could contribute to the future.”

As he prepares for the season,‘
Johnson, out of most of this past
spring practice with an ankle
problem, doesn’t want to make any
predictions about how the Panthers
might do this season.

“I don’t like to do that,” he said.
“There are so many factors
involved; it’s a long season in
which so many things can happen.

“That’s why Ifeel sorry for Penn
State,” Johnson said. “A lot of
people are saying they’re going to
be number one. To me, that’s
putting too much pressure on one
team.”

L3"? Harris finds an opening in the defense-now he needs one in Buffalo.

suade” Prof. Robinson Gehman to give Lieberman
more time to make up the work she missed.

‘fBusone didn’t come right out and ask me to give
Nancy a D,” Gehman told a reporter, “but he was
trying to pressure me.”

Thus, Lieberman is the first woman athlete to
receive publicity for academic escapades. A short
while ago, a talented woman basketball player was
cute, now she is a part of the big business of college
athletics.

“Athletes represent the university,” said the coach
of one nationally ranked wome.n’s\team. “T hey’re
going to miss classes and need incornpletes to make
up the" work. If Miss Lieberman were a male, they

women’s sports to get that far, but I sure don’t like
the double stand_ar_d_ either.”

 

  

.............. ..
. . ‘ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..

Women’s athletics finally earned economic parity
with its male counterpart, now it seeks to become as
much an economic and media success. It remains in
the hands of professors like Gehman to maintain
academic integrity and refuse to be “persuaded” by
coaches across the nation into making special con-
cessions to athletes of both sexes who are supposedly
students first.

You’ve come a long way, baby; or maybe it should
read: You’ve sunk a long way, baby. .
0 Trade tumors have become as much a part of
Pirate baseball as errors by Frank Taveras, but the

Manager Pete Peterson’s recent busts if it becomes a
reality. It seems that the Cincinnati Reds are in-
terested in making Jim Rooker and Jerry Reuss a
part of their thin pitching staff. In return, the Pirates
would receive the services of Ken Griffey, currently
leading the NL in hitting. It’s difficult to imagine the
Reds making such a foolish deal.

0 Affirmed became the 11th Triple Crown winner
by nosing out Alydar in Saturday’s Belmont Stakes.
In the nine meetings between the two horses, Af.
firmed has come out on top seven times, but never by
more than one and one—half lengths.

“I think he knows my horse,” said Laz Barrera,
Affirmed’s trainer. “When he don’t run against
Affirmed, he win easy. When he run with Affirmed,
he don’t win so easy.”

0 Danny Ozark, manager of the Philadelphia
Phillies has become one of the most quotable
managers in baseball. Ozark, who once said, “We’re
not out of it (the division race) yet,” when the
Phillies were seven games behind with only six to
play, has come up with another gem.

a When asked to explain the Phillies most recent
Slump, Ozark fﬁplied, “We’ll come around; even

would have changed the grade. I’m not sure I want

latest could make up for a couple of General

........NaD01€0n had his Watergate.”
