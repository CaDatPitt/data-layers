_ ‘ Ellsworth Center will stop being a “Boys Town” and¢
T-‘become a research center next year.

 Students ‘Come Home’

All classes at the Center, where more than 1800 students
started their college life during the four years of its existence,

 ‘will be discontinued at the end of this semester.

During World War II it was
used ﬁrst as ‘a center for student
pilot training, and later to house
military personnel. The Center
was one of the ﬁrst places in
which engineering, science and
management war training classes
were taught by the University.

The freshman and junior var-
sity football teams have the Ells-
worth ﬁeld for practice for the
past few years, and several home
games were played there.

14 Men Win 
Council Posts-n

But No Council

Anybody want to buy or barter
14 brand new councilmen, never
used, but sans council?

If interested, see Fred Lange,
assistant director at Ellsworth
Center. The 1951-52 EC Council,
elected April 4, was all set to take
over the reins from the outgoing
council at an inauguration and
awards banquet on May 1.

But the unexpected closing of
the Center will leave the council-
elect up the creek without a
budget to row over, not to men-
tion a startling lack of constitu-
ents, who will be replaced by test
tubes and research labs.

The banquet now will be a
‘wake’, Irish fashion, and Ells-
worth alumni will be invited. '

attempts to crack the IF slate, six

Two things seem apparent. IF
Council evidently is unable or un-
willing to discipline individual
fraternities who run candidates
opposing the slate.

Secondly, the political coalition
that dominated IF elections earlier
in the year was a marriage of ex-
pediency and was not a perma-
nent arrangement. To what ex-
tent the coalition has broken up
will be revealed in the internal
Student Congress elections next

est him.”

At 3:30 p.m. Miss Caroline Gor-

I

CYRIL WECHT
Reelected
# l C

By BOB THOMAS
News Editor

The Interfraternity Slate survived a surprisingly large

vote in Wednesday’s elections and managed to maneuver
most of its hand-picked candidates into ofﬁce.
‘Insurgent fraternity men and independents, however,
grabbed off two seats in Congress and four in Men’s Council.
Non-IF winners were Sam Shapiro, senior, Congress;
Don Milletary, junior, Congress; Joseph Shankel, Pharmacy;

Bert Sichelstiel, senior E&M,

John Watkins, E&M sophomore;
and Daniel Berger, College sopho-
more.

The rest of the IF -candidates
made it OK to the promised land.
Other senior Congress winners
were Bob Gardner, Cyril Wecht,
and Roger Bognar. Junior win-
ners were Larry Adler, Jim John-
ston, and Gene Rock.

Adler Most Popular

Adler won the men’s popularity
poll with 1017 votes. Voting for
the four women Congress posts
was heavy. Marion Post and Do-
lores Schaub copped senior posi-
tions with Ann Curran losing by
only four ballots.

Voters apparently stormed the
polls to vote for junior candidates
Margaret Dowling and Ann Pric-
er who had no opposition. They
racked up 1310 and 1290 votes
respectively, by far the highest
among ‘any of the election cate-
gories.

Balloting on the whole was un-
expectedly heavy. The men’s Con-
gress battle attracted 1633 votes,
133 more than last year in spite
of a sharp enrollment drop. Most
observers, had expected a dull,
li-ght-voting election, but hard
campaigning at the last minute
and charges of “dirty politics” in
IF Council whipped up needed
enthusiasm.

Council Winners Named

Voting was heavy in the Coun-
cil race, especially in the E&M
schools. The winners were: sen-
ior, Sichelstiel; junior, Rufﬁng;
sophomore, Watkins. The IF Slate
took its worst beating from the

engineers, only Rufﬁng coming
through for the frat men.

The remaining Council win-
ners were: BusAd senior, Walter
Berriman;  sophomore, M e l v in
Forst; Education,

and College
Evans, John Morgan, and John
Pentecost; junior, Morton Gold-
stein, Dan Purdy, and Jerry
Froimson. 3

Generally, “independence” was
the keynote of the election. Elec-
tion oﬁicials estimated less than
25 persons voted the straight IF
ticket. Ellsworth Center voting
was extremely light. .

Non-IF Men Second

The two non-IF men who cap-
tured Congress jobs, Sam Shapiro
and Don Milletary, both ended up
in the same position by the ﬁnal
vote tabulation. They each nos‘-
ed out two IF men and ﬁnished
in second place in the voting.

During the pre-election cam-
paigning, the E&M Schools took
the honors for lively political
stumping. The publicity paid off
for Bert Sichelstiel who took an
E&M senior spot on Men’s Coun-
cil away from the IF candidate,
Oliver Meiss.

Independent candidate G e n e
Cowie, also an engineer, ended up
a strong ﬁfth in the race for a sen-
ior Congress seat. He ﬁnished
only 11 votes behind IF’s Roger
Bognar. Bill Sullivan, one of
Cowie’s running mates on the
Merit Slate ﬁnished just one vote
behind the engineer.

Pitt Pushes TV Channel

FCC ‘Coh_si—ders
Educational TV

By LEN BAKER 
Staff Reporter 1
The next University exten

sion has a very good chance.
of being the television set in,
your living room. ,

It depends on whether Pitt,? .

other educational institutions,

,and Pittsburgh’s mayor, David 1

‘L. Lawrence, can persuade the
F e d e r a 1 Communications
Commission to grant a non-

 commercial channel for the,

Pittsburgh district.

Dr.
dean of the School of Busi-
 ness Administration, representing
{'1 Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald,
ii?‘ ‘ expressed approval of educational
5;}, TV at a meeting of the Mayor and l
representatives of 35 educational:
institutions, April 6. 5
Commissioner Gets Idea '
The idea of using the channel,
for educational purposes was or-
iginated by Frieda Hennock, fed-
eral communications commission-
er.

The meeting on April 6 was to
discover if educators were inter-
ested in the project. The 35 rep-
resentatives voted unanimous ap-
. proval of the project.
§,, They also agreed that each in-
;'. stitution should write the FCC in-
ii — , dividually, expressing their de-
 sire for such a station.

‘ The deadline for these com-
ments has been extended from
April 23 to May 7. Dean Lan-
fear recommended to the Chan-
cellor that a letter be sent to the
FCC making the following points:

1) That the University is deﬁn-
itely interested in a channel for
‘,.. - non—commerci_al, educational _pur-
 4 poses; - _

2) That television is the‘ best
means for adult education;

3) That Pitt would not be en-
tering the ﬁeld blind, since the
Heinz Chapel Choir has been tele-
vised and Dr. Albert B. Martin,
assistant professor of political
science, has been a moderatorgon
television programs.

The Chancellor has delayed
sending the letter because of the
postponed deadline.

Mayor to Speak to FCC

Mayor Lawrence has expressed
his approval of the idea. Last
Friday he conferred with Miss
Hennock in Washington on the
subject. His ofﬁce has announced
that he intends to speak before the
FCC when it holds a hearing.

The ﬁnancing of such a project
can only be speculated upon until
the time whenthe channel might

I

   

 

be granted.
Two alternatives seem to be
_ likely. Possibly the channel

could be partly commercial and
thus ‘earn enough money to be
self-supporting or the various par-
ticipating institutions could con-
tribute to its ﬁnancing.
Dean Lanfear said that

Opposition Expected

Opposition to the non-commer-

seven applicants to the FCC for
a commercial channel.

Pittsburgh area. Dumont has
rights to one. If a second goes to

Players’ New Production

Old Fashioned Melodrama

Pitt Players’ next production, Gold in the Hills; or Th!
Dead Stster’s Secret, won’t suffer from a lack of talent. 

This melodramatic play, the Players’ last offering 
year, will feature a number of new actors together with a fe

veteran Players.

Jerry Lynch, who portrays the
brave hero John, also had the
lead in Beggar on Horseback. He
has worked on the stage crew,
and has a long record of high
school acting behind him.

Ben Tater, who plays the vil-
lain, Murgatroyd, has been in
three Player’s shows, taking the
part of the demented brother in
Arsenic and Old Lace, Mr. Cady
in Beggar on Horseback, and the
gentleman caller in Glass Menag-
erie. L

A member of Theatron, honor-
ary dramatics fraternity, Tater
also had a part in the Playhouse
production of The Wedding.

New Actress Plays Heroine

Nellie, the virtuous heroine,
will be handled by a new addi-
tion to the Players, Lora Thomp-
son.

Although Miss Thompson has
had little experience in acting at
Pitt, she isn’t a stranger to the
stage. ‘

She was in A Purdy Blue Dress,
which was presented by the
speech department’s dramatics
workshop, and did some work as
an extra in Civic Light Opera pro-

Three Get

Foreign
Grants

Three graduate students on
the University faculty receiv-
ed scholarships for study
abroad this summer.

The awards were made by
‘the Norwegian and the Scot-
tish Nationality room committees
in the Chancellor’s ofﬁce,
Bachrach Goes to Oslo _

Leon Bachrach, graduate assist-
ant in economics, received a
scholarship for study at the Uni-
versity of Oslo. He will take
courses in Norwegian culture and
heritage.

Mildred Ann Ditty, instructor
in speech, and Richard Snyder,
instructor in English, were award-
ed scholarships to the University
of Edinburgh. Both will take a
survey course on the development
of modern civilization.

Fourth Year of Awards

This is the fourth year that the
Norwegian committee has made
this award and the ﬁrst year the
Scottish Committee has presented

" the scholarships to Pitt students.

Last year the Scottish commit-
tee gave scholarships to two stu-
dents from the University of Ed-
inburgh for study at Pitt.

Other recipients have been Helen
Pool Rush, dean of women, Theo-
dore Biddle, dean of men, and
Richard Campbell, a former Pitt
student.

Pirate Games

Knot Parking

The Pittsburgh Pirates have re-
turned, bringing the annual park-
ing problem back to University
students.

According to city police In-
spector Edward Maas, on game
days the parking lanes will be
ﬁlled to the maximum, and if a.
student’s car is trapped in a maze
of automobiles, it will remain
there until the game is over.

This was made clear at 2. joint
meeting of representatives from
Pitt and Tech with city traflie
planning chairman Donald Mc-
Neil about three years ago.

It has been accepted policy
since.

If

"This ought to get a rise out of him!"

birt y Politics ? 

The election is all over but the shouting, and even that
is in a minor key. The campaigning was distinguished by a
notable lack of inspiration until a’ few days before polling.
The student body displayed a marked disinterest and
shrugged the whole thing off as“‘frat boy antics.”

On the Monday before election day retiring Student

' Congressman Herm Levy gave‘ the doings a shot in the arm

with accusations that the IF slate was drawn up in a highly
surreptitous manner by Don Ewart and Earl Jacob and an
unnamed alumnus. His charges were pooh—poohed by the
trio ‘of conspirators. ‘

Now this is an annual sideshow inherent in student elec-
tions. It results from the fact that most people with political
tendencies like to band together for the purpose of getting
elected. Those left out than take the stand that such ac-
tion is “dirty politics.” ’

Rather than spend their time crying “dirty politics”
they should have concerted their “have-not” energies and
set upa slate of their own. Then they could have offered
an alternative that preceded the All-Campus slate. Instead
they waited until after IF had picked its men in the smoke-
ﬁlled third ﬂoor of some frat house and then began organiz-

ling.

Their charges have a slight taste of sour grapes——-the
wine of the discontented. They seem to be upset only be-

. a cause they or their men did not ‘get on the slate.

This seems especially true when you consider that the
accusers got where they did by using the same sort of tac-
tics that they now decry. Their charges in effect boil down
to “what was good last year is not good this year.” Apparently
political morals change like the seasons.

The calamity of student elections is that it makes no
difference who gets elected. Student government is not a
voice of the students but a football for the individual candi-

P date’s prestige.

‘VVhen the time comes that student government is worth
ﬁghting for, then there will be several parties ﬁghting over
issues. And when the time comes that these two parties will
be opposing each other, there is no doubt that they both will

0 engage in the same type of manipulation evident in this

years IF’s slate.

Election Sideli

ghls I

esp: vvlansm

The big election squabble, if nothing else, turned out a
prime example of wronged reporterhood. , V C

On the afternoon of the elections, I steppedoff an elevator
into no-women’s-land——the eighth ﬂoor: Seeing a'- familiar face,
I automatically stuck out my hand. A ”

The “face” ignored my attempted. handshakeas he walked
by. “You gawd—damned Westbrook Pegler,” he snorted.

This allegation I unequivocally
deny. My name is not Westb-rook
Pegler, you can check my birth
certiﬁcate. A A '
Nothing toj"C|ique

The accusations, however, that
a small clique was running pol-
itics, didn’t seem to hold water. A
lot of big-wigs were passing each
other in the halls without the
faintest glimmer of recognition.

Here are some of the other elec-
tion stories circulating
campus. One concerns a budding
politician who was so worn out
from hustling votes all day that
he forgot to vote himself. ’
Strange Bedfellows

Another concerns the regular IF

around“

meeting Wednesday night. Two
politicos were arguing. their fav-
orite subject. “All I’ve got to say,”
yelled one, a fraternity president,
“is that politics sure makes
strange bedfellows.” “Who have
you been sleeping with?” his
friend shot back. »
One Man. Three Names

The man of distinction on the
great day was Delta Tau Dan
Purdy. His was the only name
to be spelled three different ways.
On the ballot he was Carroll Fos-
ter Purdy Jr. while on the IF
slate he ran as just Dan Purdy.
The merit slate listed him as Car-
rolllPurdy. Which is it ‘/Dan, I

mean Carroll? _
More Confusion
”Adding to the general confusi”
was the fact that the IF- slat,
ran under the moniker of the 
Campus Party. Reports had 1:“
opposition ready: to calls the.
selves the IF ,sIa'-te. How abo‘
that! ‘V

Hot Air Is Gone

non THOMAS

Nowthat. old Aeolus has bless-
ed the Cathedral campus by blow-
ing away mos. of the election dis-
cord, charges, counter—charges,
and other assorted hot air, nor-
mality will return. , a

Successful candidates will take
their seats in Congress and Men’s
Council, and the headline stuff
will be forgotten. But a few in-
teresting odds: and ends will linger
on with us.

For instance, we’ll probably be
hearing for some time yet how
someone made off with 1500 print-
ed All-Campus slates from the
Student Congress ﬁle in the dean
of men’s ofﬁce. Who knows? Who
cares?

The election deserves at least
one more comment. Never have
we seen so much printed material
ﬂying around loose. We could

-have started a mean bonﬁre with

the slates, counter—slates, and gen-
eral propaganda we received on
only one trip to the polls. At
times it threatened to turn into a
paper deluge. -
MacArthur Hysteria

Let’s leave ‘elections for the
time, however, and turn to that

', included)

newest! American fad, MacArthur
Hysteria. Putting it mildly, we
could say, "‘It’s really something.”

Actually the thing has resolved
itself ‘into a‘ three-ring circus
complete with peanuts, pop corn,

and a breathless radio commentary
on the Great Event on Tuesday
night. It’s OK to welcome home
a General but must every Middle-
sex village and farm ring its
church bells and blow its whistles
at the moment he sets foot on
American soil? You would think
a whole expeditionary force had
landed the way they carried on.

Women and Politics

Then again, people (ourselves
are still wondering
why the ladies turned their part
of the election into a farce by
nominating only ﬁve women for
four Congress seats. This, it» ap-
pears, just ain’t straight-shootin’.

On patrol around the polls in
the Commons Room we heard
many loud comments (none of
them very pretty) about candi-
dates who daredto campaign for
themselves. Many were the good
men condemned because they tried
to hustle themselves a few votes.

Class Cutting  
ls Universal
Problem

(Faculty rnembers at Pitt have
been complaining recently that it’s
a great deal of trouble, to report
absences from class every month
in accordance. with a. new‘ ruling
adopted here. But Pitt professors
can take heart from the fact that
teachers in other colleges have
the same, and possibly worse,
problems.)

cording class cuts, inaugurated
this semester at North Central
College, is just an experiment and

In the past, he pointed out, the
college has had no rule on class
attendance, except that it was
expected. The system of class
cuts was left up to the individual
professor. However, it seemed
that there was too much differ-
ence in the methods by which
each handled the situation, some
so lenient that others seemed un-
reasonably hard. Therefore the
need was seen for more" uniform-

Golfers Travel
To Juniata

Coach Dave McCormack sends
his golf team against Juniata Col-

lege tomorrow at Juniata in Pitt’s‘

second match of the season West
Virginia defeated Pitt in the
opener last Saturday.

Two new boys are on the list
as possible starters--George
Straub and William McBride. Al-
though they haven’t had any
practice as yet, if either of them
are better than the number six or
seven man now playing, they will
be put on the starting team im-
mediately. '

Unless these new men break in,
the same six who played against
West Virginia will start against
Juniata—Bob Reilly, Bill Stitt,
Andy Figura, Dick «McCarthy,
Mike Swart, and Bob Andres.

Reports on the Juniata team
say that they have one of the

best golf teams in the state. They

have lost only three matches in
their last 30 outings.

After rain caused the cancella-_‘
tion of their season opener last
Saturday against West Virginia,
the Panther netmen will try again
to open on Tuesday in an away
meet with Bethany. ,

Coach David O’Loulghlin and his
assistant, Joe Ball, haven’t been
able to see too much of what the
squad can do because of the

iweather, but the ﬁrst four posi-
tions are almost certain.

John Lohstoeter is the number
one man, Harry Campney number
two man, Earl Roof number three
man, and Joe Bendel, a promis-
ingsophomore, number four man.

The rest of the squad consists
of Bob Ilsevich, Fred Lichtman,
and Chuck Berney.

Pitt under the lights, it ap-
pears that the first game of
their two-game series of April
27 and 28 will be played at
West Field in Munhall.

Pitt is deﬁnitely in favor of
the night game. Frank Car-

‘Phi Epsilon Pi won the fraternity championship by edging Kappa Nu,

16-18, 17-15, and 15-13, last Wednesday at Trees gym.

The night before, Phi Ep lost to

Against Kappa Nu, though, the
Pepsplayed inspired ball to upset
their league conquerors. After
dropping the ﬁrst decision——a
hard fought extra-point game-—-
the Peps rallied behind their all-
around star, Sam Shapiro to take
the next two games.

Shapiro played brilliantly, set-
ting and spiking, and leading the

\ Softball Summary

SAE Outlasts

« l Sigma Pi

SAE got off to a good start in
the fraternity softball league by
outlasting Sigma Pi, 6-4, Wednes-
.day at Ellsworth Center ﬁeld.

Wednesday’s games marked the
opening of the IM softball season.

The SAE—Sigma Pi contest was
a nip and tuck affair which saw
the lead change hands four times.
Sigma Pi capitalized on a Walk
and three singles in the ﬁrst in-
ning to give them an early ‘two
run margin.

SAE Rallies .

That lead held up until the
third frame when the SAE push-
ed three runs across to lead by

- one run. Each team scored twice

in the ﬁfth and SAE added an in-

surance tally in the sixth.
Pitcher George Suto got credit

Tech’s Humor

Nlag Dropped

The Panther is liable to be the
only humor magazine left in the
city of Pittsburgh.

This is due to the fact that the
April issue of Tech’s humor mag-
azine, Scot, has been recalled.

According to Stanley Marsh,
head of the public relations de-
partment at Tech, it was recalled
from edition because of ﬁnancial
diﬁiculties. In’ addition, certain
remarks which may have proved
libelous had it been put out on
sale.

Mr. Marsh said that lack of
revenue and sales had caused the
money problem, and the writers
,ﬂwho were supposed to_have been
h u m o r o u s, overstepped their
bounds in describing Pitts‘burgh’s
night clubs and restaurants.

The magazine was to have been
a take-off on a page in the New
Yorker magazine called “Goings
on About Town”,'but Mr. Marsh
stated that the magazine madea
feeble attempt at humor and fail-
ed. This edition was in poor taste,
he stated.

~Onovelist, essayist, or journalist.

Based on ’49 Conference

Three of the essays are based
on talks originally given at the
1949 writers conference. These
are: (1) The Novelist Today, by
Storm Jameson, prominent British
novelist who held the rank of vis-
iting professor of English here in
1948-49; (2) Conception and Tech-
nique, by Warren Beck, writer
and teacher of English at Law-
rence College and at Bread Loaf
School of English; (3) The Re-

ﬂdedication of the Artist, by Law-

rence Lee, associate professor of
English here.

Miss Jameson, in analyzing cur-
rent opinion on the modern nov-
elist’s place in society, comments
in passing on the influence of
Lenin and his ideas of the writer's
function in society.

Difference in.Russia

“The effective difference be-
tween a Russian novelist‘ and a
government ‘servant is that the
novelist is more highly paid for
what he does for society,” she de-
clares.

Give Us Back the Poets is the
title of the fourth essay by Wil-
liam T. Hastings, professor of Eng-
lish at Brown University. It is
taken from his addresses to Phi
Beta Kappa groups during April,
1950.

Percival Hunt, retired professor
of English here, contributed the
ﬁfth essay, Of Poetry. I

Sterility Is Danger

Edwin L. Peterson, professor of
English at Pitt offers a summation
of the advice presented in these
essays. He states that sterile
teaching and sterile studying are
the results of forgetting the essen-
tial of obtaining and keeping an
insight into the true meaning of
life. He emphasizes the fact that
good prose or poetry cannot be
written without this understand-
mg.

Peterson states brieﬂy the wider
meaning of the book for all stu-
dents when he says:

“Surely to encourage search for
signiﬁcance—-be’ it in engineering.
medicine, commerce, science, or
art—is one of the duties of a uni-
versity. Especially is this true in
our own time, when every evening
makes us wonder about the com-‘
ing dawn.”

The price of the book is $3, but
a special 50 cent discount is of-
fered to students and faculty.

Famous Woman TraVeler’s
Grand-niece Enrolled Here

By POLLY LEATHERMAN

Peggy Cochrane, 21 year old senior in the School of
Education, is the grand—niece of one of the famous news-

paper women of America.

Her great aunt was Nellie‘Bly,
the ﬁrst around-the—world speed
traveler. Nellie was born Eliza-
beth Cochran in 1867 in Cochran’s
Mills, Armstrong County‘.

Sixty-one years ago she circled
the globe in 7 Zdays, 6 hours, and
11 minutes, a record at that time.

Peggy, in spite‘ of her ancestry,
does not want to be a wri-ter, al-
though she feels “slightly guilty”
at not carrying on the tradition.
She hopes to become a speech
teacher when she graduates in
June. "

one being chief justice of the
Senior Court. She is one of the
nominees for senior queen and an
active member of Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority.

Her ﬁrst ambition was to be an
aviatrix and “maybe ﬂy around
the world.”

This was the ambition of a ten ,
year old, but the desire to travel,
as her great aunt did, is still there.

Wants to Speak

She will not, however, do it
with a typewriter, for Peggy does
not write unless “under academic
pressure.” She hopes to be able
to carry on the family tradition

in speaking, also one of the ac-
complishments of Nellie Bly.

nounced later). , ’

Impressive Procession .

After the sermon, the entire as- .
sembly, carrying lighted candles Vi
and praying the rosary, will form :
a procession and walk up the
winding driveway to the upper ,
campus. In the quadrangle in»-
front of St. Joseph’s Hall at the‘
top of the hill, the ceremony hon-
oring Mary will be climaxed with;
outdoor adoration and benediction
