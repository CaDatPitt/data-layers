University of Pittsburgh

Rally raises awareness

By Julie D. Hannon

News Assistant

Sporting dreads pulled
back in a tie-dyed hair band,
an unidentified Pitt sopho-
more reached for the hand of

a woman dressed in a black_

blazer and penny loafers. He_
danced in circles around her
until she hesitantly joined
him, the two twirling hand-
in-handioutside Benedum
Engineering Auditorium on
Friday as they each awaited a
"performance by their favorite
band, Anti-Flag.

“This is what it’s about,”
he chanted as -he swayed.
“F—- SGB or BGS, whatever
they’re called. This is what
the university should be
doing — good music‘ for a

good cause. This matters.
You know what I mean, man?
It doesn’t matter who you are

,— you’re affected.”

The dancing couple was
joined by nearly 200 others
who gathered at a rally
against all forms of violence,

‘including domestic abuse,

police brutality and sexual
assault. The event was spon-
sored by the Campus
Women’s Organization,
which said the idea stemmed
from a recent meeting where
many members expressed
concern for their safety, on
campus and in general.

“A lot of people have been
expressing their fear as well
as their disgust with all the
violence, regardless of what
form,” said Lesley Albanese,

co-president of CWO. “We
basically came up with the
idea of a concert to raise
awareness. Violence is some-
thing that affects all groups,
all people on campus.”
Members -of BiGALA
shared a poem about the
heartache of child abuse as
well as the hate attached to
differences in sexual orienta-

tion. One speaker commented .

on the wonder that we can
even fall asleep at night with
all that faces this world, from
the assassination of Yitzkah
Rabin to the acquittal of O.J.
Simpson.

And the emotions hit closer
to home when CWO co-pres-
ident Amy Sitnick spoke on
behalf of the Kevin Cecil
f_und.

Four Pitt students strut their stuff at the Black

“It shows that no one is
immune. It happens on our
own campus,” said Sitnick.

All five bands —— Anti-

Flag, The Johnsons,
Blindsight, Aus Rotten and
Pitt’s African Drum

Ensemble — played at no
charge to show support for
the fight against violence.
“The bands and a lot of
other v'olun’teer"s came
through to make the night a
success, and we want to
thank them,” said Albanese.
“‘It shows that people from

pus can join together and
have a good time for a good

can have unity and Friday
proved it.”

Schenley
cook has
hepoﬁﬁs

By Anthony Breznican
Staﬁ Writer

Rumors that a cook in
Schenley Cafe was working
with hepatitis were conﬁrmed
Friday, but Director of Food
Services Betsy Sallade-Farina
said students were not in danger
because the strain was not trans-
ferable through food.

The unidentified cook was
diagnosed at the end of October
and has not been back to wo
since. -
“One of the food service
workers at Schenley had hepati-
tis, but it was hepatitis C, which
is non-transferable through
food,” Sallade—Farina said

Hepatitis C, a liver disease,
can only be spread through bod-
ily ﬂuids, and not through air or
food.

“You could only get hepatitis
C by having sex or sharing cont-
aminated needles [with the car-
rier] or through a blood transfu-
sion,” Sallade—Farina said.
"There was no risk of transmit-
ting to students, and no danger
at all of getting hepatitis from
the worker.”

Training officer for Food
Protection at the Allegheny
County Health Department Jan
Steinberg agreed that there was
no danger to students.

S GB presiden f-elect hopes to if unite studen rs

By Danielle Shuster
Staff Writer

Andy Wuertele, Student Government Board
president-elect, hopes to unite student groups
on Pitt’s campus to make the overall student
experience at this university better.

Impossible, many maysay. Perhaps, but if

his own life is any example of bringing togeth- A

er completely different interests, it may be
highly probable.

Wuertele’s involvements read like a student
activities manual. He is president of the
Institute of Industrial Engineers and of the Blue
and Gold Society, secretary of Omicron Delta
Kappa national leadership/honor society, Chief
Justice of the Interfratemity Council, a brother
of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, a mentor, chair
of the Family House Dance Marathon, a 1994
SGB member and is currently on the SGB
recycling committee. As a freshman, he also
took part in the Emerging Leader program.

Wuertele, a fourth-year student, is double
majoring in industrial engineering and philoso-
phy~

“Philosophy and industrial engineering com-
plement each other, they work with the same
material in two diiferent ways,” said Wuertele.
“Philosophy helps you ﬁnd the best way of life,
and engineering helps you fulﬁll it.”

Five years from now,’ Wuertele sees himself

working for a South American company.

“I love the people and culture of South
America,” he said “I see a tremendous amotmt
of opportunity for growth there in the next
decade or two.” -

Wuertele’s love affair with South American’

culture began after his freshman year when he
lived with a family in Santiago, Chile.

It continued this past summer when a
Nicaraguan family whose two-year-old son
needed a new heart stayed with his family.

“The amount my family learned from this
family was incredible,” said Wuertele.

“The Nicaraguan mother worked so hard,”
he said. “Things like having a microwave,
washer, dryer and a vacuum cleaner were
amazing to her.”

What impressed Wuertele most about the
South American people is their work ethic and
how much they care about other people.

“Any one of them would welcome you into
their home to stay and think nothing of it,” he
said.

Eventually, Wuertele would like to move
into working in the public sector.

“The government needs to become more
efﬁcient,” said Wuertele. “It needs to follow
business’ example of cutting waste.”

After his sophomore year at Pitt, he interned
with Congressman Paul McHale in
Washington.

Wuertele was born in Colorado while his
parents were ‘attending the University of
Colorado. His father was in the Air Force, so as

a child he and his family moved around quite a-

bit.

When Wuertele was in third grade, his father ‘

left the Air Force and they settled in York, Neb.

Wuertele describes York as a “small town of ,

about 8,000 people surrounded with corn
ﬁel .” ’

Wuertele’s family moved to Bethlehem, Pa...

when he was in 11th grade. While in
Bethlehem, he decided to come to Pitt.

“Everyone in _ Nebraska goes to the
University of Nebraska, but on the East Coast
there are so many choices. I was overwhelmed
with them,” he said.

“I knew I wanted to go to school in the city,
and when everything came together, Pitt was
the best overall choice,” said Wuertele. “After
about six months I realized that I couldn’t have
picked a better school.”

What impresses Wuertele most about Pitt is
the diversity of the people and the opportunities
available.

However. he is discouraged by the lack of
concerned people and by the exodus of top
administrators. For this reason, he decided to
run for SGB president

“It made me want to stand up and do some-
thing about it,” Wuertele said.

Hepatitis
°From page 1

“Hepatitis C is not food-bome,”
Steinberg said “The only [strain
of hepatitis] that would restrict the
cook from working would be
hepatitis A, because that is the one
that is transferable through food.”

Sallade-Farina said the cook has
not returned to work since being
diagnosed almost three weeks
ago.

“He became ill in October, and
their last day of work was in the
end of October,” she said.

The worker was found negative
for hepatitis B, but positive for C.

Because the worker handled
food, a test for strain A was

requested A ment,” Sallade-Farina said. “We

Sallade-Farina said the results
for that test have not been received
yet.

The employee did use proper

safety precautions while in service
at the cafeteria.

“The person did use gloves, and
did not really come into contact
one-on-one with the students and
only dealt with a small area of the
whole food production, so the
risks were very minimal,” Sallade-
Farina said

When a food worker is suspect-

Bring on the women!!

INCREDIBLE JOB OPPORTUNITIES!!! Ladies, look-
ing for a job that includes a lot offun and great money? Meet
new people and get paid to do it. Apply today to be a Hooters
girl!

You might have seen an ad like this in the papers, especially
since the Pittsburgh area is now home to two Hooters restau-
rants. But if the EEOC has its way, you won’t be seeing them
much longer. Someone has had the bright idea to challenge
Hooters’ hiring policy, saying that it is discriminatory against
men, and the EEOC is taking the restaurant to court to change
the policy.

Has anyone ever tried to picture a Hooters guy? If you saw
the back page of last Thursday’s USA Today, you wouldn’t 6
have to picture it — they showed it to you in plain sight (and
an ugly one at that). Hooters took out the ad to prove a point
—— the restaurant is based around the idea of pretty women in
short shorts and shirts serving beer. The name alone drives
that point home ‘even harder.

I There is no reason why Hooters should be forced to change
’ its staff line-up. To put it bluntly, men don’t have “hooters,”
and they would look pretty silly wearing stuffed bras to fill
the customers’ expectations of the restaurant. Whether or not
you like the concept of Hooters is not the point here. Sex
sells, and Hooters has taken that maxim to its highest plateau.
If you don’t like it, don’t go. But the people who do like
going to Hooters go with a distinct expectation for certain
~ things, including large-breasted women. No one goes to
Hooters to" savor the fine cuisine or enjoy a quiet dinner with
the family. ’
, The EEOC has taken on the cause of someone who is just
out to prove a point. Thereis no other reason why any man
would have applied to work there, when he could just as easi-
ly have applied to work at any other restaurant. Really, how
many of you guys out there were reaching forithe phone to
‘call about the WANTED: EXOTIC FEMALE DANCERS
ad that you saw the other day in the back of this paper?
Probably not too many. .

The government, through its manipulative arm the EEOC, is

going too far by trying to tell the owners of Hooters what kind

. of business they can run. This is not about equal opportunity,
it is ‘challenging the very business that Hooters thrivingly
operates. If the restaurant is forced to hire male servers, a lot

i of that business is going to suffer. (How many of the guys that
you know who go to Hooters would want to watch men serve
food in short shorts and shirts? Hell, a lot of women wouldn’t
even want to look at that.)

The EEOC needs to get its nose out of those hooters (restau-
rants, that is). It should not be in the market of telling private
business owners what kinds of businesses they are allowed to

‘ run. And "if running a certain kind of business means hiring
only large-breasted women, so be it. Someone made a con-_
scious decision to go after the Hooters chain, for one reason
or another, and the EEOC should not be a strong-arm tactic -
for ruining a multimillion dollar company just to prove some-
one’s point. ~

Use your rights: remain silent

ince my last column
S about big government

was so wildly successful,
I have decided to continue that
theme. Some types of govern-
ment intervention come in the
form of labeling things as
“rights.” Supposedly, the basic
rights of Americans are life,

' liberty and the- pursuit of hap-

piness. Now, anyone who
wants to sound big-hearted
can make up new “rights.” In
the last few, years, we have
been told that Americans have
a “right” toihealth care, a

“right” to higher education, a

“right” to a safety net, a
“right” to be paid a certain

wage and so forth. Some-

might argue that the hand of
government needs to provide
such things so that we may
have life and the pursuit of
happiness. But my question is,
if all of these things are rights,
then_why not extend the con-
cept of rights to more impor-

_ tant things, such as food,

clothing and housing?

Times have changed since
the Declaration of
Independence declared our
rights, but the principles of
good government have not
changed. Certainly, the gov-
ernment plays a role in insur-
ing our basic rights, but it too
often puts the interests of
small groups of people above
the good of the general public.

 

Matt
Mills

college were to better career
opportunities, then student aid
would be more justified.
However, many students could
just as easily seek the career
of/their choice without col-
lege. The government should
only give student aid to good
students who are unable to
pursue their career goals in a
more inexpensive way.

A right to a certain wage.
Every few years, liberals will
suggest that we help the work-
ing poor by raising the mini-
mum wage. They claim that it
would be disgraceful for peo-
pleito live on such meager
salaries, and everyone has a
“right” to a healthy wage.
However, every increase in
the minimum wage causes the
loss of hundreds of thousands
of jobs. More importantly,
very few people support a
family with a minimum-wage
job. About 80 percent of mini-
mum-wage employees live in

Let’s take a look at some of-rrron‘-poor households, and

the things that have been
labeled as “rights.”

A right to a higher educa-
tion. This one has really taken
hold lately. We welcomed Al

Gore and had a huge rally to i

“save student aid” when the
only thing at stake was the
possibility of paying the inter-
est on student loans during the
first six months after gradua-
tion. If student aid recipients
can’t afford to pay four to nine
dollars per month more after
graduation, then student aid is
worthless in the first place.
But why does everyone have a
right to a college education
anyway? If the sole purpose of

only about 8 percent of work-
ers receiving minimum wage
maintain families. If the gov-
ernment would get rid of the
minimum wage, unemploy-
ment would decrease, part-
time jobs for young people
would be more accessible and
more people could get their
foot in the door of the job
market. Besides, it would give
unions something to worry
about and a chance to feel
important again.

A right to a safety net. It is
no secret that our social safety
net has turned into a ham-
mock, as Phil Gramm has

' described it. During the early

years of our country, we had
no federal welfare programs. I
may have missed something in
my history classes, but I don’t
think people were dying of
starvation or lying naked in
the streets. In the early 19th
century, there were hundreds
of “free institutions” which
provided for the impover-
ished. A foreign observer,
Alexis de Toqueville, noted
that Americans “display gen-
eral compassion” and feel
“compassion for the sufferings
of one another.” Instead of
allowing charitable groups to
assist the poor, the federal
government has blindly hand-
ed out money. The results are
an excessive welfare state and
a permanent underclass. This
might sound harsh, but people
don’t have a right to govern-
ment handouts. The govern-
ment should have more faith
in the good of the American
people. For instance, during
the 1980s, when the economy
flourished, there was a great
increase in personal and cor-
porate charitable giving. If the
federal government would
leave welfare to those who
specialize in it, more people
would rise from poverty,
unemployment would
decrease and billions of dol-
lars would be saved.

Clearly, the notion of our
“rights” has been taken too

far. As our country has gotten-

wealthier, liberals have rea-
soned that the government can
afford to intervene and assist
more ‘people. We can no
longer afford it. Before
Medicare, Medicaid, Social
Security and welfare, people
were able to meet their own
needs and assist others. By
eliminating unnecessary
“rights,” we can enjoy the full
benefits of capitalism. This
process would be much easier
if people demanding “rights”
would exercise their right to
remain silent.

Matt Mills is twice as clever
as anyone writing him hate
mail.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Hey 1 .

Pitt football fans, if you’re
depressed about the Panthers’
lackluster season and you want
to renew your spirit or your on

\ Just hop in a car, bring six

 bucks and a dictionary and head

out west to South Bend and the

College Football Hall of Fame. "

Most important, however, is
not what you bring, it’s what
you leave at home — your tem-
per.

’ Because soon after you walk
into the building that is home to
the greatest college gridiron
players ever, you will notice
some terrible mistakes.

Irish break Pil'l's Bi

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — The
Lady Panther volleyball team
almost didn’t have a chance to
play for their eighth consecu-
tive Big East championship.

Eventually they did, but Pitt
was steamrolled by the Notre
Dame Fighting Irish in the
finals, breaking its streak of
seven consecutive Big East
titles. -

Just when it appeared Pitt
would easily dispose of the
sixth-seeded Georgetown
Hoyas in the semifinal match
on Saturday, the team’s play
took a nosedive, and Pitt strug-
gled to win in five games, 15-5,
15-5, 10-15, 13-15, 15-8.

“We’ve been here for two
days. We were anxious to play,”
head coach Cindy Alvear said.
“I knew we would come out
like a ball of fire.”

Four hitting errors by
Georgetown gave Pitt an early
4-0 lead in the first game.
Georgetown scored two points

. before Pitt went on an 8-point

run to put the game away, win-
ning 15-5.
The second game was more

‘of the same. This time it was

Georgetown that fought its way
to an early 4-2. lead. Pitt, led by
all-Big East junior Jennie
Driscoll, scored 9 consecutive
points to make the score 11-4.

Georgetown called a time
out, but Driscoll continued her
domination, with 4 kills in the
remainder of the second game.
She led the team with 18 kills in
the match. Pitt won the second
game 15-5.

Pitt continued to roll in the
beginning of the third game.
Kelly*Meyers served 6 consecu-

tive points to give Pitt a 7-0
lead. As quickly as Pitt built
their lead, it was gone.
Georgetown roared back to
make the score 7-6. Pitt called a
time out, but the tide of the
game had been turned.
Georgetown went on to win
game three 15-10.

“We won the first two games
and were up 7-0 in the third. It
was easy to get into a lull,”
Alvear said. “Against Rutgers
and Seton Hall, [in the regular
season] the same thing hap-
pened. We were in control and
then hit a lull.”

The fourth game saw little
improvement. Neither team led

by more than 3 points in this‘

mistake-filled game. Pitt’s hit-
ting percentage as a team was a
.034. Georgetown was hardly
any better at .059. Somebody
had to win the game, and
Georgetown came out with a
sloppy 15-13 win.

In the deciding fifth game,
Pitt jumped out to a 6-2 lead,
but Georgetown’ fought back to
tie the game at 6. After a Pitt
time out, the Panthers came out
on fire again. ,

A Pitt dig went behind the
baseline, almost into the seats
behind the court. Kelly Meyers
chased the ball down and kept it

in play, and Stephanie Dufresne _

got it back over the net from
behind the baseline. That play
put Pitt up 8-6, and the Lady
Panthers never looked back. Pit
won 15-8. ’
“We’ve had so many fifth
games this year. I knew we’d be
poised and experienced‘ enough
to come through,” Alvear said.
The victory over Georgetown
put Pitt in the championship
game against Notre Dame on
Sunday afternoon to go for an

eighth consecutive Big East
championship. Notre Dame
was the only Big East team to
beat Pitt this season, 3-1 in late
October.

“When we play well, we’re
great. When we don’t, we’re
horrible. I wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see the same kind of
match against Notre Dame,”
Alvear said, after the
Georgetown match.-

' Her prediction was not com-

pletely wrong. Pitt came out
fast again, but this time, it lost
control and never regained it.
Notre Dame won the Big East
championship and an automatic
berth in the NCAA tournament
with a 5-15, 15-7, 15-1, 15-4
victory over the Lady Panthers.

Wrestling team looks to crack the top 10

Tony Fiorini/.StafflPhtographr

Pitt's senior-
/aden squad
ready to take
nation by storm

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling teamlhas built up
quite a tradition over the last decade, In
nine of the last 10 seasons, the Panthers
have finished ranked among the top 27
teams in the nation. Coach Rande
Stottlemyer is hoping for even greater
success from the 1995-96 squad.

“We haven’t been able to crack the
top 10,” Stottlemyer said. “That’s our
goal for this year.”

That’s a lofty goal, but it appears rea-
sonable for a team that is loaded with
talent returning from last year’s suc-
cessful squad-. ~

Last year, Pitt set a school record for
most dual meet victories in a season and
finished 26th at the NCAA champi-

_onships. The Panthers are already

ranked 18th this preseason.

“We’re a veteran team. Basically,
we’re going to depend on four seniors,”
Stottlemyer said. “As. they go, we will
gO.n 1

Team captains John Richey, who

wrestled at 134 pounds last season, and 

J.J. Fasnacht, an All-American at 142
pounds, will lead the team,. along with
fellow seniors‘Brett Gould, last year’s
Eastern Wrestling League runner-up at
150 pounds, and Pat Wiltanger, the
League heavyweight runner-up.

All four qualified for last season's .

NCAA championships, along with three
other Pitt wrestlers — Bryan Matusic,
who wrestled at 167 pounds last year,
but will likely move up to 177 this sea-
son; Chad Jesko (126), last year’s
Eastern League Freshman of the Year;
and All-American John Withrow (158).
Jesko and Withrow will be redshirted
this season.

“That’s seven out of 10. Seventy per-
cent of our team is national qualifiers,”
Stottlemyer said.

The other three spots on the team
won't be without talent either. Pitt is an
experienced team led by seniors, but
there are some talented underclassmen
to fill the remaining spots on the team.

Matusic’s change in weight class
leaves the 167-pound spot “wide open,”
according to Stottlemyer. Freshman Joel

Girosky and sophomore Mark Johnson ,

are competing for the position.‘ Another
freshman, Mike Ziska, is the top candi-
date to wrestle at 126 pounds.

While most of us _ are home for
Thanksgiving, the Pitt wrestling team
will open its season on Saturday, Nov.
25, at Lock Haven, one of four teams in
the EWL that is nationally ranked this
preseason. Along with Pitt and Lock
Haven, Clarion and Edinboro are also
ranked. In addition, Stottlemyer said he
expects West Virginia to be competi-
tive. .

“A lot of people don’t know what

they have,” Stottlemyer said. “They’ll '

be in there too.” «

West Virginia will only add to the
competition in an already tough confer-
ence. . i
“It’s a very competitive conference,”
Stottlemyer said of the Eastern League.
“We’ve always been one of the top four
conferences.”

Stottlemyer likes what he sees on his
team this year.

“I feel good about this team,"
Stottlemyer said. “As long as we stay
healthy, we should have a good season.”

and then a typewriter appeared
on the screen. I hit the letters of
my all-time favorite Pitt player,
Dan Marine, and then hit enter.

‘There is no information con-
cerning this player,” read the
screen. ’

“What the hell is this?” I
wondered.

I typed in Dorsett, Green,
even Tom Tumulty. Each time it
was the same. Before I kicked
the stupid computer, I saw a
sign on it that stated “some
players are not listed because
schools have not answered

g requests for information.”

After reading that, I’d had
enough. It was time to leave the

0From page 5

Dame had four players with at
least 13 kills in the match.

Like in the semis, Pitt started
strong. Pitt had a .357 hitting
percentage in the first game
against Notre Dame, a figure
close to the ones in the victo-
ries over Georgetown. But
things quickly fell apart for the
Lady Panthers.

Notre Dame stepped its play
up a notch after losing that first
game. It made 9 hitting errors
in the first game, and only 7 in
the next three games. Notre
Dame’s team hitting percent-
age in the third game, a 15-1
Notre Dame win, was .722.

The Lady Panthers’ overall
record is now 18-8, and they
will finish the regular season
this weekend at a tournament
at Long Beach State.
