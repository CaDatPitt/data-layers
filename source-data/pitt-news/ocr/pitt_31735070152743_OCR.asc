Board goes public with student groups’ budget appeals

p Abbey Reighard
Staﬁ Writer

A disagreement on money matters be-
tween the Student Government Board
and Allocations Committee ultimately
proved that the Board holds the power
of the purse.

The Board and Allocations Chair Nas-
reen Harun met on Saturday for a public
meeting to consult with student groups
about budget requests and deliberate
on the Board’s fall budget request. The
Board postponed its weekly Tuesday
night meeting to Saturday because sev-
eral members didn’t return in time from

the ACC Lobbying Day in Washington D.C.

While previous Boards have deliberat-
ed upon budget appeals privately, Harun
said she and Board President Mike Nites
decided to hold public budget appeals for
student groups this year.

Researcher offers fresh view to contemporize traditional feminism

Meagan Hart
Stq]_"f' Wrz'ter

Ilham Adam is from Tanzania, a place where
she said feminism is more “individualistic.”

“There’s a focus on keeping your role
as a woman,” Adam, an undeclared fresh-
man with an interest in global studies, said.
“If I’m just playing soccer with the guys, it
seems like it’s unnatural. I’m expected to
wash dishes instead.”

Adam has become interested in explor-
ing feminism at a global and local level and‘
was one of about 90 attendees — half of
whom were men — who came to hear Syl-
via Walby speak at Pitt on Friday. Walby, a
professor of sociology at Lancaster Univer-
sity in the United Kingdom, spoke about
feminism as counter—hegemonic at Pitt’s
38th Conference of the Political Economy
of the World-System. This year’s confer-
ence focused on “Social Movements and
Global Transformation: Prospects and
Challenges.”

In this case, counter—hegemonic refers

to the attempt to confront the existing sta-
tus quo in gender roles.

Walby has been the founding chair-
holder of gender research for the United
Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural
Organization since 2008.

Walby began by challenging the contem-
porary feminist theories of two American
scholars, Nancy Fraser and Hester Eisen-
stein,_'both of which, she said, lack empirical
evidence. Fraser is a critical theorist and
professor of sociopolitical sciences and
philosophy at The New School in New York
City. Eisenstein is a professor of sociology
at Queens College. i

“I’m a social scientist. I look for hard
evidence,” Walby said.

Eisenstein focuses on the sociology of
gender and globalization in relation to the
international women’s movement. Fraser’s
theory focuses on conceptions of justice and
how individual groups can make stronger
contributions to society.

The ﬁrst wave of feminism is grounded
in the 1920s, when women became more

active in the suffrage movement.
“For me, 1920 was a key moment when

‘ suffrage actualization went all around the

world. Nowadays, people are saying that
feminism has been ‘invisibilized,’” Walby
said. “I want to change that.”

A few historical feminist victories that
Walby mentioned include the establish-
ment of a minimum wage, which levels the
economic playing ﬁeld for both sexes, and

public education, which offers the same

type of education for both sexes.

Walby called herself a “feminist,” al-
though she doesn’t like the restrictions of
the title. She also opposes the concept of a
singular feminist identity, which was useful
in the initial ﬁght for suffrage but has since
become “too restrictive, too narrowing and
too cultural.” A

“I don’t want to be asked, ‘Are you afemi-
nist?’ I want to be asked, Are you involved
in a feminist project?”’ Walby said.

Jackie Smith,‘ a professor of sociology
and director of graduate studies at Pitt,
said she selected Walby to speak because

feminism has been somewhat neglected
in recent years.

“I want ‘to lift up the voices of women
and make scholars at Pitt think more about
global feminism,” she said. .“There are also
many lessons to be learned from integrated
feminist research.” I

Lisa Parker, a professor of human genet-
ics at Pitt who teaches a class on feminist
theory, helped to publicize the lecture to
students in the Women’s Studies Program
and included Walby’s published works in
her curriculum. Parker opts to focus on
biological ethics and health-related femi-
nism in class. I

“For instance, the policies of health care
don’t focus on women as much as men,”
Parker said. “Women also tend to be the
ones who give up their careers in order to
raise families, and I disagree with that.”

For Adam, listening to Walby speak was
“eye—opening.”

“Leaming about feminism in this coun-
try opens up my mind to the other possibili-
ties,” she said. I _

“We’re just holding everyone account-
able and letting everyone know what’s
going on,” Harun said. '

Student groups and the Board submit
requests to the Allocations Committee
twice annually in the spring and fall.
The committee then deliberates and
recommends actions to the Board that
the Board can approve, deny or defer.

“I know it seems strange for us to vote
on our own budget,” Nites said. “But the
very least we could do is vote on it pub-
licly.”

Budgets provide student groups with
longer-term funding for documented
events the student groups are preparing
for in the future. The Board holds budget
appeals so student groups can appeal the
Allocations recommendation before the
Board issues a final vote on the request.

Nites said students can submit de-
ferred budget‘ requests as a supplemental

request. I

“It just means the conversation is held
oﬁ' for a little later,” Nites said. “It’s not

a negative thing.”

Nites added that the Board’s por-
tion of the allocations process should
be public, but the Allocation Commit-
tee’s deliberations about requests should
be private because the committee has
“serious discussions” about allocation
requests that “can’t always take place
publicly tactfully.”

Harun agreed that the idea of the
Board voting on its budget’ may seem
strange, but Harun also said she thinks
the system is fair.

“When these people are elected by the
student body, I believe that the student
body is putting faith into [the Board] to
make fair decisions like this,” Harun said.

Harun read aloud the Allocations rec-
ommendation to the Board’s fall budget
request, which includes Board—led ini-
tiatives. The Board requested a total of
$14,967.30.

Of the total, the committee rec-
ommended to deny $8,170, approve
$5,613.55 and defer $1,183.75 for 10
programs.

The Board then deliberated and
voted on the request, concluding with
an approval of $14,497.30 and deferral

of $470, despite the committee recom-
mendation.

The Allocations Committee recom-

mended to deny the Board’s request of
$700 for the SGB Emergency Fund as well
as $2,000 for the Crisis Management
Fund, a reservation of funds for students
who experience housing crises, such as
house fires. Harun said the committee
felt that the funds were lump sums and
didn’t provide the necessary documen-
tation for approval from the Allocations
Committee. '

“When we make our decisions, we’re
very precise about documentation so
that the amount we allocate is what is
absolutely necessary according to the
documentation,” Harun said.

The Board could use the Emergency
Fund for unforeseen expenses, accord-
ing to Board member Abby Zurschmit.

“We are a little different from other
student organizations,” Zurschmit said.
“Sometimes we are asked to take on costs
that we didn’t incur.”

Zurschmit said the Office of Student
Affairs has previously asked the Student
Government Board to host events, in-
cluding March Service Madness, which

the Board paid for with money from the-

Emergency Fund.

E The previous Board also had a sepa-
rate Committee Emergency Fund of
$5,000 specifically for the Student Gov-
ernment Committees. The current Board
eliminated the Committee Emergency
Fund to cut costs, according to Zurschmit
and Nites.

Board member Sara Klein said she
was “skeptical” about the ‘Emergency
Fund because other student organiza-
tions likely wouldn’t receive money for
a fund they might not use.

“If another organization came up to
us and asked for funds just in case some-
thing happens, I don’t think we would
fund for them,” Klein said. “I know things
come up for us, but things come, up for
other student organizations, too.”

Nites said the Board has cut down
on the fund, which amounted to $2,500
last year. 

Nites also said the previous Board _

allocated close to $56,000 for its spring
and fall budgets.
Board member Ryan Orr said he

thinks the Board should keep the Emer-
gency Fund because the Board requested
less funding in its overall budget than
the amount for which previous Boards
have asked.

“I think because we did cut down on
the budget so much this year, having the
emergency fund available to us is cru-
cial,” Orr said.

The Board approved the Emergency
Fund in full.

The Board also approved the Crisis
Management Fund in full, despite the
Allocations recommendation.

Board member Graeme Meyer in-
troduced the program in February as a
“safeguard” and defended funding the
program’s implementation on Saturday.

“The amount of time and effort the
Board was putting into raising funds [for
housing crises] was exceeding what the
Board was actually making,” Meyer said.

Meyer said he feels that it is the re-
sponsibility of the student government

to “respond effectively” when student
housing crises happen.

The Allocations Committee also rec-
ommended the Board deny a request of
$470 to maintain the neon light “Tree of
Knowledge” display on the ﬁrst floor of
the William Pitt Union. The display was
a gift to the University from a previous
Board, but the current Board is respon-
sible for any maintenance costs.

Harun said the committee denied the
request for funds to conduct mainte-
nance on the display in the fall, should re-
pairs be necessary, because “the commit-
tee did not feel as if that was an expense
that should be incurred by the Board.”

The Board discussed whether or not
administrators should be responsible for
maintaining the tree display and if the
Board should take the tree down.

The Board deferred the request for the
$470 to maintain the Tree of Knowledge
if it breaks, so the amount will not fac-
tor into its budget. The Board decided
it would make a supplemental request
if the display breaks.

“I think it’s something we need to talk
to administration about,” Nites said.

NRA is unfairin targeting surgeon-general nominee 

Rohith Palli
Colummst

It seems likely that the National Riﬂe As-
sociation will successfully destroy the
nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy, President
Barack Obama’s nominee for surgeon gen-
eral. Yet there is no opposition to Murthy
on grounds of credentials: He is merely
being punished for expressing common
sense.

In a series of tweets, Murthy conveyed
the mainstream view that stricter gun re-
strictions should be sought. Additionally,

he asserted the already-known consensus ‘
among the medical community that gun vi- A

olence is indeed a public health issue. Still,
‘when asked about these beliefs in detail
during a conﬁrmation hearing, Murthy in-
sisted that he would focus on heart disease

OPINIONS  

and other illnesses most pertinent to the
health of Americans, so one set of tweets
does not necessarily deﬁne his priorities.

The Senate,-which is in charge of ap-
proving presidential nominations, is not so
sure. The senators who support the NRKS
stance on his nomination not only dem-
onstrate a deep preference for re—election
over the national good, but also a reckless
disregard for the ability of professionals
such as Murthy to publicly state the con-
sensus in their ﬁeld. And even though the
Democratic party has a majority control
over the Senate, the NRA’s level of inﬂuence
is made apparent because of this.

For the NRA, the tweets make him an
“anti—gun radical.” This sort of labeling
is not only inaccurate, but it also takes
away from the integrity of the national
dialogue. Senators, and more importantly

voters, need to see through these ruses
and refuse to vote with these factions of
over—simpliﬁers.

An easy approach is that of “The Daily

Show”: simply state that the NRA will stop .

at nothing to promote gun rights. Yet this
should be totally obvious. After all, the NRA
as an organization exists if and only if it
continues to have a reason to exist, like in a
Darwinian landscape. Furthermore, it will

a only receive donations or have inﬂuence if

people with money and power listen to it.
These people will only listen if the NRA’s
political ads are effective, but these ads are

only effective if they are not met with pub— ,

lic opposition. Citizens should, therefore,
become informed before exerting influence
on policy. .

This requires that information be pre-
sented to them matter-of-factly, as I men-

tioned earlier. If people knew the facts,
rather than the talking points of gun ad-
vocates, they might withhold support for
thelrejectionrof a candidate for surgeon
general because he believes in an academic
consensus supported by the Pennsylvania
Medical Society and by the president him-
self. Supporting the NRA in this situation

‘ would then be like ﬁring your doctor for

him believing in evolution. g
_ Along with this, questions -have arisen

about whether Murthy is too political to
-be surgeon general. This sword, however,

cuts both ways. If a position is meant to be
apolitical, then rejecting a candidate for
being too political merely shifts the politi-
cization from the candidate to the selec-
tion process. For instance, the government

shouldn’t discriminate against Hobby Lob-
by when awarding contracts because they
believe the use of certain contraceptives is
equivalent to abortion. They have the right
to have an identity outside of ﬁinctioning
as a private business.

Similarly, candidates for more non-po-
litical ofﬁces should not have their politics
questioned. The potential surgeon general
should be judged solely on his medical abil-

ities and knowledge. Therefore, punishing
him for asserting a consensus among the
medical community is unwarranted and
unnecessary. ’

Moreover, this silly sideshow substan-
tially takes away from the real debate to be
had here — whether Murthy, at 36 years
old, is ready to be surgeon general. Rich-
ard Carmona, a former Democratic Sen-
ate candidate and surgeon general from
2002 to 2006, certainly doesn’t think so.
Carmona says Murthy is too young —- he
completed his residency in 2006, leaving
him only eight years into his career-proper

as a physician.

In a profession that normally requires I

more than 11 years of training, this seems
like an incredibly short amount of time to
rise to one of the most important positions
in the medical community. _

That isn’t to say, however, that Mur-
thy isn’t an exceptional individual. He has
started two health care tech companies and
a charity, Visions Worldwide, in addition to
serving on the U.S. Presidential Advisory
Group on Prevention, Health Promotion
and Integrative and Public Health since
2011- That’s in_ addition to being a prac-

ticing physician at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital in Boston.

Murthy could conceivably excel as sur-
geon general as he has in so many other
roles. Or maybe, as Carmona believes, he
isn’t ready. None of this, however, hinges
on, involves, nor should involve his beliefs
on gun control. Muzzling professionals
from stating the truth distracts from real
problems with their credentials. The pub-
lie, and especially its representatives, need

Orange roll
Panthers,
sweeping
series

Caitlin Hinsey
Staﬂ Writer

The visiting Syracuse team showed Pitt’s soft-
ball team what it looks like to feel at home
this weekend. ~

The Orange (18-18, 9-7ACC) have won ﬁve
straight games and seem to be ﬁttingwell into
the ACC, while the Panthers (13-22, 4-12 ACC)
struggle to adjust intheir new conference. Pitt
has been swept by its last two ACC opponents
—— Syracuse and Virginia Tech——while losing
seven of the last eight games that ithas played.

The Panthers’ offense started strongly in
all three games, but cooled off as the game
progressed. In each of the three games, Pitt
held and proceeded to lose leads of at least
two runs, which resulted in Pitt’s lackluster
weekend. .

Syracuse 5, Pitt 2

Tori Nirschl broke open the scoring in
the fourth inning, giving Pitt a 2-0 lead with a
home runthatwas the longestinvartabedian
Field history. The two-run shot cleared the soc-
certeam’s press box, which looms high above
and about 15 feet behind the center-ﬁeld wall.

The home run stood out as the Panthers’
only hit in the game.

Pitcher Savannah King was pitching well,
shutting out the Orange through four innings
before allowing two runs with two outs in the
ﬁlth. With the bases loaded, Syracuse’s Julie
Wambold smacked a double to right center
that brought home the tying run. The junior
second baseman would go 2-for-3 with two
RBIs for the game. '

King ﬁnished the game having allowed
two runs on four hits with four strikeouts in

Up—and—down play has become the
theme of this year’s Pitt baseball team.

During the weekend, it only experi-
enced the latter, continuing to struggle
away from home.

Coach_]oeJordano’s team faltered in
a road series against the 20th-ranked
Miami Hurricanes, losing all three
games -—— 12-2, 1-0 and 7-2, respec-
tively — and falling to 16-19 and 8-1_0
in the ACC. ,

It’s the second straight-away confer-
ence series Pitt exited empty-handed,

recalling last month’s shutout at Vir-
ginia‘Tech.

Miami 12, Pitt 2 a

Most of Pitt’s struggles in the open-
ing game came with a slew of shortcom-
ings‘ on the mound. ‘

No. 20 Miami prevailed 12-2 over
the visitors.

Jordano pulled starting pitcher Sam
Mersing, who surrendered three runs
on three hits and five walks, after two
innings. Rhys Aldenhoven then tried to
act as tourniquet, but mimicked Mers-
ing’s play. .

Aldenhoven gave up three earned
runs in as many innings, and like Mers-

ing, struggled to not give up free passes,
walking four. Two additional pitchers,
Andrew Belfiglio andlAdam Dian, took

the mound for Pitt, giving up two and

three earned runs, respectively.

On offense, the struggle wasn’t as
absolute, despite what the scoreline
suggests. The Panthers collected eight
hits, but they came too spread out be-
tween innings to get a rally going. In
the sixth inning, they scored both of
their runs by way of a Steven Shelin-
sky Jr. two-out double to left center
field that scored Dylan Wolsonovich

loss. Larkin was pulled after recording only

The Orange plated four runs in the ﬁfth
inning and ﬁve in the sixth inning, erasing
Pitt’s early 3-0 lead. . '

Pitt chased Syracuse starting pitcher Syd-

ney O’Hara from the game in-the ﬁrst inning ‘

when she allowed three runs on four hits.
Junior outﬁelders Jordan Fannin and Carly
Thea led off with solo, back—to—back home
runs. Then Nirschl, thenext batter, walked
and advanced to second as Maggie Sevilla hit a
single to right ﬁeld. Two batters later, Nirschl
came home on an RBI single by Katherine

Kramer to push Pitt ahead 3-0. .
The Panthers would hold onto their lead,

4 despite Corinne .Ozanne’s two—run homer in

the third inning. Pitt added a run to its lead

’ in the fourth with an RBI single bygFannin.

Syracuse responded in the next half of
the inning by plating four rLms.Jasmine Wat-
son’s two—run homer tied the score at 4-4 and
O’Hara, who was moved from pitching to ﬁrst
base, also hit a tW0-I'l.1I1 home run, which put
the Orange up 6-4. O’Hara ﬁnished the game
4-for-4 with two runs and four RBIs.

The Orange continued to dominate at the
plate in the sixth by scoring all ﬁve runs with
two outs. Afteraﬁeldingerror by the Panthers,
Syracuse tacked on a run to go up 7-4. The
Orange then collected four straight hits to
score four runs. King, who also started game
two, got the loss to bring her record to 7-14.
She gave up 10 runs —— only six earned — on
12 hits, while Larkin ﬁnished the game and
gave up one run on two hits.

The Orange responded in the top of the
second by scoring four runs. Outﬁelder Mary
Dombrowski hit atwo—run homer, while Shir-
ley Daniels and Nicole Lundstrom had RBI hits
that put Syracuse in the lead 4-3.

Sophomore inﬁelder Kathryn Duran hit a
solo shot in the second to tie the score at 4~4

Syracuse regained the lead in the fourth on an

The Orange then opened the lead up in the
seventh with the ﬁrst six batters reaching base

Pitt started a rally in the bottom of the
seventh with back-to-back hits by Thea and
Nirschl and aﬁelding error that allowed Sevilla
to reach base. Thea and Nirschl scored, but it
wasn’t enough to erase the deﬁcit in the ﬁnal
inning — yet another familiar scene for the
Panthers this weekend. I

Chris Diaz struck out 10 and got the
win to improve to 7-0.

Miami 1, Pitt 0

In contrast to the opener, Pitt had a
real chance to win the second contest,
taking it to an extra inning.

Pitt’s offense mustered only three
hits in the 1-0 loss. Miami’s Andrew
Suarez had no problem shutting down
his opposition, surrendering those
three hits and striking out nine — a
performance he managed through nine
innings and throwing 93 pitches.

For the majority of the game, Pitt’s
pitching matched Miami’s.Joseph Har-
vey got the start, pitching sixf score-
less frames while allowing five hits
and striking out three. Hobie Harris
relieved Harvey with a likewise com-
mendable performance until the 10th
inning, when he allowed the walk-off
run. With one out, Johnny Ruiz doubled
into left field. To set up the force—out,

Harris walked Dale Carey, who went
three for four in the game. Tyler Palmer
then grounded out to advance the run-
ners to second and third. Finally, Willie
Abreu singled, allowing Ruiz to score
the game-winning run. Pitt shortstop
Wolsonovich attempted to throw out
Abreu at ﬁrst base to end the inning, but

Abreu slid in headfirst and was called

safe on a close play A _ _
Despite the loss,]orda'no was proud
.of his._team’s effort. A

“We played hard tonight,” Jordana ,

said in a press release. “Coming off a
disappointing game on Friday, our guys
came out and battled for 10 innings.
To haveﬂthe game end on a tough call
is difficult to take, but once again we
were right there in a position to win the

ball game. We need to keep playing hard .

and good things will happen.”

Miami 7, Pitt 2

Unable to mount a late comeback
and avoid the sweep after a four-run
eighth inning by the opposition, Pitt
fell in the last game of its trip south.

Bryan Radziewski started the game
for Miami and received the victory. He
