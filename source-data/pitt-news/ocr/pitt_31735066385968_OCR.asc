* Campus leaders
respond to ROTC

B

By Scot Ross and

The Pitt News

To Black Action Society
chairperson Doug Ligons, the
university administration’s
reluctance to take action against
the ROTC comes down to a
question of whether money or
morality is more important.

“If Posvar really wanted to, he
could say ‘all right, if that’s how
ROTC is going to be. If you are
going to discriminate on the basis
of homosexuality then [I’m going
to] sever that relationship.’ The
reason he probably won’t is
economics. I think it’s important
for Posvar to remember that the
university is a nonprofit
organization and not an
organization run to make a proﬁt, ”
he said.

Ligons said that the
adrninistration’s stand toward the
ROTC’s policy of discriminating
against homosexuals, which is
mandated by the Department of
Defense, makes a statement about
Pitt’s stand on anti—discrirnination.

“It says to me that the university
doesn’t want to take a stand on
what they already determined is
the right thing to do. They already
said that discrimination according
to sexual orientation is not right.

And yet, they allow this
organization to persist [in]
discriminating against

homosexuals. Basically, what it
says to me is: ‘Well, we're not
anti-discrirnination against [gays]
because the majority of the
campus is eligible for ROTC, and
we don’t want to~take ROTC
away from them,’” he said.
Ligons thinks that this
discrimination could spread to
other groups protected under
Pitt’s anti—discrimination policy.
“If they can do it to
homosexuals, they can do it to
blacks, they can do it tojews, and
they can do it to Orientals,” he

said.

Women are also protected
under Pitt’s anti-discrimination
policy. Debbie Gould, president
of the Campus Women’s
Organization, said that she thinks
the administration could be doing
more about the ROTC issue.

“I highly doubt that if Pitt felt
strongly about this, [there would
be] nothing they [could] do. I just
don’t think that it is a priority for
Pitt. Because if it was, then they
would do something about it,”
she said. ‘‘I definitely think that it
is very wrong, but it doesn’t
surprise me because I don’t think
that Pitt prioritizes anti-
discrimination. ”

The question of the ROTC“s
role on campus could be brought
up at today's University Senate
Council meeting. Linguistics
professor Sarah Thomason, a
member of the council, said that
she does not accept Posvar’s
definition of ROTC as an “outside
organization.”

“I don’t personally accept the
reasoning. It’s on campus; it’s in
the Cathedral. It’s part of the
university. It’s true that the faculty
are not hired by the university,
but they hold university“
appointment. My personal feeling
is that it’s a problem to have
discrimination in violation [of the
policyl,” she said.

Thomason wasn't sure if the
issue would be discussed today.

“It’s certainly an issue that could
be brought up. It’s an appropriate
issue. Any issue around the
university that people are
concerned about is appropriate,”
Thomason said.

“Faculty Senate doesn’t always
address things that you would
think that they ought to address.
I doubt if the administration would
bring it up. I think that it would
have to come from faculty or
students.”

Students warm up to a.rmual spring ﬂing
despite postponements and cbtlly weather

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

Although the weather was reminiscent of winter, the resident assistants of Schenley Quad and

62 la A...

Tower B held this year’s annual spring-ﬂing cookout.

. The event, which originally was scheduled for Wednesday, April 4, was postponed twice because
of bad weather and was affected by the low temperatures. “It’s hard to be in a spring—like mood
when it’s so cold," said Samantha Burks, who was shivering.

The low temperature eliminated some of the food and events. A dunking machine, which was
previously scheduled for the cookout, was left out because according to resident director Sue

Uhazie, “It’s too damn cold.”

In order to compensate for the cancellations, two of Pitt’s sororities, Delta Sigma Theta and Alpha
Kappa Alpha, separately performedimpressive dance routines called “stepping.” Stepping is a

traditional type of tap dance, done without music and accompanied by the performers singing and/

or chanting.

Many of the otherscheduled events were held, including a pie-eating contest which left the
participants quite messy. Sophomore pharmacy student Vince Pasquarelli participated in the event.

Although he didn’t win, he had a good time.

“I had about five pieces of pizza before I came here, so I didn’t plan on winning. 1 just wanted
to have a good time and get some free food. I love coconut-cream pie. It’s my favorite,” he said.
“I wanted to go for a tie-breaker,” said,Kevin Drewery, who tied for first with Alan Joynes. “The

in use.

Allocations chairman Gil Borok had the

All they wanted was some snacks.
Last month, when Concerned Leaders
for Environmental Action Now asked Pitt’s

3- Student Government Board Allocations

Committee for $80 to provide food and
coffee for those attending the group’s
student-activism conference, the request
was denied.

On the same day, however, participants
in the SGB-sponsored leadership
conference got to enjoy similar
refreshments, paid for by the student-
activities fee. Needless to say, members of

‘CLEAN suspected a double standard was

challenging job of explaining to CLEAN
why the alleged contradiction was actually
just following SGB policy.

“Each group is given $200 for food,” said
the Pitt senior. “But we only fund food for
recmitment purposes, which [CLEAN’sl
function wasn’t.

“It may not have been a terrible thing to
have given this group $80 for food since
they hadn’t used their $200," Borok
continued. “But we have to follow the
policies set for the year.”

This is just one example of the situations
Borok frequently finds himself in as he
attempts to help groups understand why

they can not always receive the full funding
they want from the SGB.

“When a group disagrees with allocations
policy, sometimes there's almost nothing
I can do to explain it to them. It’s not
always the money that’s involved; it’s the
principle. People will fight me to the end
over $10.”

As allocations chairman, Borok heads
the eight-member group that oversees
funding for Pitt’s 150 student organizations.
Because of the uncertainty that groups
and individual students sometimes express
concerning how their $32—per-term student-
activities fee is allocated, Borok recently
took some time out of his hectic schedule
to outline the process.

First, the Pitt senior explained, each
group wishing to be considered for
allocations must submit a budget to the
Allocations Committee. In March, the
committee reviews these submissions and
interviews representatives from each
student group, giving the members an
opportunity to voice their opinions. ‘

After much consideration, the committee
makes and then presents its budget
proposals to the SGB.

“Once we make a recommendation, the
group has a right to appeal to SGB anything
that they are not happy with," said Borok.
“But the appeals are very minimal, because
we're consistent across the board with

The clothes people wear say a
lot about them, but one Carnegie

y Mellon University art major thinks

the way people wear their clothes
says more.

“I’m really good at reading
people by their clothes,” said
Raven. “Some people wear the
clothes that they think are in, or

   

they are trying to please other
people. It bugs me.”

Raven knows about clothes
because she paints them. Raven
enjoys creating her own self-
portrait by painting her clothes.
“They express my personality,"
she said, "because I like bright

colors, and I tend to be on the.

comfortable ‘wearing may not
appeal to everyone, but she loves
them and loves painting them.

“When I wear something,” she
said, “I tend to celebrate the little
strange things in life.”

Raven’s strangest piece of
clothing is her “junk” jacket. The

name is precise because she has

spent the last three years sewing
junk on it. There are Coke cans,
old watches, scissors, rocks, a
hand mirror, Barbie doll clothes,
paint tubes, paint brushes and
partof as can opener hanging
from it. Although the jacket
already weighs 15 pounds, she
said that it’s only half finished.

Much of Ravens wardrobe

comes from thrift shops or her
/mother's closet. As well as being
stylish, she said these clothes are
cheaper and last longer.

I Ier eccentric tastes do not stop
with junk jackets, neon shirts,
Star Trek shoes, wild stripes, fake
leopard skin and loud polka dots.
“I found a dead stuffed raven’s
head," she said. “I’m going to sew
it on a hat.” '

Raven wasn't always so
ﬂamboyant. Iler best friend Cat,
an exchange student from Austria,
was her inspiration.

school so that I would be

accepted, but they still picked on
me. Cat wore what she wanted,
and she was happy," she said.

Raven describes the oversized
dress her friend Cat wore as a
weird, off-white colored linen
with brown and navy flowers on
it. “She could wear something
else and look much better in it,"
Raven said, “but she really likes
it. 'l'hat’s cool.”

Whether you’re wearing a
business suit or a tie-dyed '1‘-shirt,
Raven believes the important
thing is feeling good in it.

“You can tell that they feel
good,” she said, “and that‘s great.”

Continued from page 1
president of student affairs, sees
the ROTC’s discrimination as part
of a larger problem. Donham
doesn’t t_hink that the issue should
be resolved at Pitt.

“I suppose in theory, we could
say  ‘it’s offensive, it’s wrong’
and therefore an extreme action
[would be necessary]. But
personally, I don’t think that
solves anything. I think the larger
issue is a homophobic issue,”
Donham said. .

“I don’t think kicking ROTC
out or trying to start some
movement to kick ROTC out

would accomplish anything other
than kicking ROTC out and
keeping students [involved in
ROTC] from benefiting [from itl,”
he said. “Granted, they are
beneﬁting from something that
some are deprived [of], but not
by virtue of their own consent.”

Donham suggested that writing
letters to congressmen would help
to alleviate the national problem
of homophobia, but Ligons called
for a solution at Pitt.

“They have to make a decision
where they stand. If ROTC is
going to discriminate against
homosexuals, then [it] should not

be allowed to benefit from the
resources that the university
makes open to groups that don’t
discriminate," Ligons said.

“There is supposed to be a
separation between the university
and politics. Since the ROTC is
affiliated with the university, they
should have to live up to the
university’s rules and not vice
versa. Students are the main
reason that the university exists,
and therefore the university
should live up to providing for
the student needs, [rather than]
the students providing for the
university.”

Both won gift certiﬁcates to the
University Book Center for their
efforts.

Another dramatic event was a
large musical-chairs competition
that began with about 50
participants. The final two
participants, Kenya Gret and
Godie Essiet, battled one another
for the final chair, with Gret
defeating Essiet. Gret won a $40
facial from Pizazz. The crowd‘
roared its approval.‘

Gret said humbly,
was pure luck.” 

“She nudged me out of there.
I’m all right. I can accept defeat,
but next year I’ll be back,” Essiet
said dramatically.

The postponing also had a
negative effect because some of
the resident assistants were
unavailable to attend and help
with the cookout, according to
resident assistant Bernie Comfort.

The repeated postponing of
the event caused a conﬂict with
some students’ studying for final
exams and writing of final papers.

“The only thing that I don’tiike

\All it was,
\

about [the cookout] is that it’s
during a time when I need to
study for finals. I really shouldn't
be here. I have four ﬁnals next
week. If [the cookout] would
have been last week, that would
have been perfect.” said junior
chemistry major Lori Pecan, who
resides in the quad.

Comfort, along with many of
the participants, felt that all in all,
spring ﬂing was a lot of fun and
a major success: “I think it was
very successful and the weather
didn't dampen it at all. We had
more people [at spring ﬂing] than
at fall ﬂing. Overall, it was a great
success.” ‘

The costs for the event couldn’t
be tallied by Comfort, and Uhazie
was unavailable for comment.
However, Comfort noted that the
costs seemed reasonable. Many
things, including a lot of the food
and all of the prizes, were

donated. The remaining costs C

were paid for by the Ofﬁce of
Residence Life.

Participants danced to ' music

recommendations. The board is
informed on all of these, and [the
groups] get opinions as to why
we do what we do."

If a group does decide to appeal
the committee’s decision, it
presents its case to the SGB.
Borok is also granted equal time
to tell the board how the
committee reached the original
amount set. After this first
presentation by both sides, the
board does not determine the
actual amount the group should
receive; it only decides to agree
or disagree with the original
judgement of the Allocations
Committee.

When the board chooses not to
side with allocationshthe proposal
is sent back to therallocations
committee for a second
recommendation. If board
members still do not agree with
the revision, the decision is left in
their hands.

“The elected body, the SGB,
has the final say when things get
appealed,” Borok said.

All recommendations that are
not appealed are presented in a
lump sum to the board for
approval. “lSGB] accepts it
as trusting the Allocations

Committee to have done the

work,” said Borok. Budgets for
next year were mass approved at
Thursday’s SGB meeting.

Once the funding is approved,
it is sent to the business
department in the Student
Activities , Office, 1 where the
computer work and ‘business

should receive is a rather
complicated process, because
every 0 year the allocations
committee receives a much higher
amount of requested funds than
it has available to allocate. ’lhis
year, for example, $348,000 was
amount available to be dispersed.

‘However, “our requests exceeded

that amount by about $160,000,”
Borok said.

All of this money comes out of
the student-activities fees, 50
percent of which the SGB is
granted. The remainder is split
between the Pitt Program Council,
which is given 35 percent and
the media services, which
receives the other 15 percent.

are sponsored by a university
school, usually receive’ the most
funding.

“Just because you are a
governance group does not mean
you get more money,” said Borok.
“However, because they have
bigger constituencies and need
more money, [governance
groups] tend to get more money.”

Even though the SGB, also a
governancegroup, is allocated
$50,000— more than any other
organization —— Borok explained
that this is necessary. ‘

“SGB is an exception to certain
rules because they serve so many
other groups. Most of what a
group does, the group members
benefit from. As for what SGB
does, the university benefits from.
That is whythey get exceptions.”

One; eira-mple~‘Borok‘ cited is»-the

refreshments served at the
previously mentioned leadership
conference.

“The taxi service costs $10,000.
So you say SGB gets $50,000, but
$10,000 of that is for the taxi
service.” i

For educational conferences,
SGB also gets an extra. All-student
groups are allocated funding for
one conference, but SGI3 this
year voted itself an additional
one, even though the trip was
denied by the Allocations
Committee. _

‘‘In retrospect, [voting for the

conference] was a good move,

because ofthe benefits that came
out of the second conference,”
said ‘ Borok. “Next year the
Allocations Committee approved
a second c()nference for the
board.”

Borok stressed that SGI3 social
functions are not funded through
activities’ fees.

“We have an end of the year
SGB party that we pay for
ourselves,’’ he said. I

In response to students that
complain about paying the S32
activities fee, Borok said, “’l'here’s
so many activities going on, and
yet we have this ‘apathy problem.’
If we only charged the people
who use Pitt facilities, the more
each would have to pay. 532 can

get you a lot on this campus. If
you go to a PPC movie once,
you're using it. It's your problem
if you don't take advantage of it,
because it’s there."

Crediting improved relations
between student groups and the
Allocations Committee, the
outgoing chairperson claimed
the 5GB funding process is
running better than. ever.

“We made a lot ofchanges
when I came in," said Borok. “In
terms of communicating more
with groups; telling them how
the process works and keeping
the liasons in touch with the
groups.”

The Pitt senior continued, “We
had 118 budgets come in this
year in comparison to 9/1 last
year. So we‘re obviously doing a
better job.” \- .

Diversity at Pitt...

East German student enjoys .
variety found in United States

(Editor's note: This is the first of a series

' proﬁling the experienca of international
students who attend the University of

Pittsburgh.)

By Pria Bhargava
Staff Writer

Peter Bothig has lived the kind of life
we may see in the movies or on the
nightly news —-— which, as a matter of

» fact, he was seen on. Wearing jeans and
a trench coat, I the curly blond-haired,
blue-eyed man from East Berlin lights a
cigarette. andbegins recalling his life in
East Germany.

He predominantly remembers it as a
less commercialized life than the United
States —-— where money was never a
problem —-— everyone got what they
needed. Accordingto Bothig, people
related well with one another due to an
“economically similar life. They were

‘ lgovemmentl,

also more unified because they had the
same enemy —- the government. You
were either for or against the
making it easy to
differentiate people.”

On the other hand, he admits, “If
you’re living with the same problems,
and /you can’t do anything, it gets
boring, and you begin to crave new
experiences."

To find those experiences, he was
compelled to legally emigrate to West
Berlin last March, leaving behind his
entire family and job. Now, of course,
the situation is different, with the Berlin ‘
Wall being taken down; the closed
society is now on its way to being more
open. , '

He attained a master’s degree in

German literature while in Germany.

At the suggestion of a professor in West

Berlin, and because of his desire to

Life experiences aid older

students in academic setting " i

(Editor's note: This is the first of a series
profiling the eaqperienca of olderstudents
who attend the University of Pittsburgh .)

By Mark Stat’
Staff Writer

Many different races, cultures,
backgrounds and attitudes combine to
give the University of Pittsburgh a special
ﬂavor. One group of undergraduate
students that contributes to this diversity
is the older students who are returning to
classes after extended sojourns or are
venturing onto campus for the first time.

Dean John Bolvin of the College of
General Studies claims that there are
approximately 5,000 students enrolled in
CGS. Nearly 50 percent of those students
are over the age of 25 and are employed
full time. “Many of those students are on
a college campus for the first time,” he‘
said. ‘

Two such students at Pitt are 48-
year-old freshman Winifred Dinkins
and 56-year-old sophomore Betty Long,
good friends who work together at
Mallions, a Pittsburgh public
intermediate school, and are enrolled
in Pitt's New Careers Program in the
College of Arts and Sciences for
paraprofessionals wishing to become.
professionals.

Dinkins, who has worked for 20
years on the board of education, says
that she now attends Pitt to get her
degree in teaching. "The reason why I
have decided to go to school is because
I'm doing things on my job that I feel
I should get paid more for. I tutor kids
in math, and I could do morelfor the
students] ifl could become a teacher.
I really can't teach a child unless I have
the credentials (to be a teacherl,” she
said.

Dinkins, the "grandmother of
three girls, claims that she always
wanted to go to college but
wasn’t able to attend until now.
She said, “(Going to college] is
what I wanted to do when I was
18 years old, butl couldn’t. Now,
there’s no one at home except
for my husband and [me], and I
can finally do it.”

Dinkins notes that it is difficult
to be a returning student. “It’s
hard being in a class with 18-
year-olds because times have
changed, and my thought
patterns are different than theirs.

“We don’t see the same things.
When they were babies, we went
through the civil—rights struggle.
They don’t value the same
education as we did. Everything
is handed to them. These kids
may have a job on the side, but

about what to cook for dinner;

a you may be thinking aboutwhere

you are going to hang out
tonight.”

Betty 1 Long, an in—house
suspension teacher and the
grandmother of two boys, ages
nine months and one year,
attended Pitt for one year in 1969
—— then she had a baby and was
forced to withdraw. She agrees

that it is more difficult dealing ‘

with the stress of her work load
at her age. However, she feels
that her maturity and life

experiences are to her benefit.
Because of their previous
experiences, Pitt gives Dinkins
and Long each 15 life-experience
credits toward their degrees.
“Academically, and as far as
competition is concerned, it’s

we’ve been -living it. ...Coming

Whereas Long excels in
psychology, Dinkins does well in
math, and the two women both
enjoy history, especially history
that which pertains to their Afro-
American culture. Both women
agree that the classes they take
offer much more to them than
just credits or grades.

“I imagine that the Younger

Long said. “Whereas lwe’rel not

“I did make a ‘D,’ “ Dinkins
said timidly. “But you know what?

applied to U.S. colleges. He finally
came to Pitt for a year last
September as a guest, teaching
German classes. He likes the
American accent; however,
Bothig says he has found it
somewhat difficult adjusting to a
different language and sometimes
feels severely limited in the ways
which he can express himself.

What he found when he arrived
was very different from his image
of the United States: that of New
York or the West Coast, typical of
Europeans. He was pleasantly
surprised to see that the country
is mostly rural, as it is herein
Pennsylvania, and he is amazed
by the spaciousness of the
countryside. He enjoys driving
on the highway “to feel and
experience the American
landscape.”

Surprisingly, one of the first
things to strike him here were
unfamiliar smells. His sense of
smell has been heightened by all

the “perfumed, unnatural smells”
that he encounters everywhere
he goes in America. There is a
sense of suppressing reality and
living in artifice, he said.
“Americans try to create an
artiﬁcial history,” Bothig said. He
tells of his experience at Niagara
Falls as an example. He
considered the falls to be
tremendously superficial, “music
was being played with the falls.
 There were different colored
lights.” And of course, more
angles to view the falls were
provided than were actually
necessary. He said he has a
difficult time seeing beyond the
surface with life here. i
Also, from his experience here,
he observes that Americans are
_ not very knowledgeable about
the rest of the world, and that
politics are less important here
than in Germany. He says this
may be due to a very different
experience of history here, and
he fee1s‘Americans suffer from
that. Bothig says this seems to be

evidenced in the apathetic views

situation in East Berlin moved
him to action.

In fact, Bothig was imprisoned
once for organizing groups to
help East Germans escape to the
West and for sending a letter of
protest to the government. “I hung
around with a group of artists,
We would hold exhibitions and

Bothig is impressed with the‘

He says he likes how the United

Bothig said.

He was particularly impressed,

UNIVERSITY OF 

The university is losing a valuable asset

I had always slightly doubted
my ability as a writer.

Sure, there were good days and
bad days, but overall, I was scared
— scared that I did not have “what
it takes.”

, During high school, I acquired
an interest in writing. As a matter

of fact,. once I reached college, I .

seemed to do much better in classes
that involved some type of writing.
One semester, as I haphazardly
made my way through the course-
description guide, I came across
an introduction-to-journalism
course (English Writing 55).

:1 decided to act upon my writing
interest, and I took the class. I was
not aware that the professor who
was to teach the class would affect
me greatly during the semester,

- having a profound impact on both

my academic and personal life.
Saying that I was naive to jour-
nalism would be an understate-
ment. It may as well have been
Latin, because I was not what one

' would Call a “natural” at writing.

But I was determined and intrigued
by the subject.

The professor of the class must
have noticed this interest in me. I

constantly asked questions and

anxiously awaited his critiques on
the things that I had written.
My interest in journalism was

moving me along, but without the
knowledge and guidance of that
professor, I most definitely would
not be where I am today.

His accomplishments were both
innumerable and fascinating. He
had managed to hold many re-
spectable positions in journalism
and had come out shining as an
instructor.

The interest and almost total
absorption could easily be seen on
the faces of his students as he
conducted class. '

Before becoming acquainted
with him, I knew close to nothing
about the impact of such people as
William Randolph Hearst, Truman
Capote and Thomas Jefferson.

He had the rare ability among
professors to eloquently convey
his knowledge to his students in a
way that sometimes left us in deep
thought, sometimes speechless and
sometimes in tears.

Many times, I left his class in a
rage after receiving a bad grade.
He was definitely tough. But his
students found themselves want-
ing to do well, and therefore, they
put forth tremendous effort.

He had become more than an
instructor to all of us. He was our
friend.

It is indescribable how he man-
aged to know so much, do so

much, and at the same time, feel so
much for each and every one of his
students.

It seems as though Pitt has over-
looked his value and importance
to both the students and the uni-
versity as a whole.

This semester, his contract was
up for renewal. It was not re-

  Pugliese

newed. 

Perhaps the university seemed
to think that someone of a more
“literary nature” should be teach-
ing the course.

The fact of the matter is that the
practical experience and knowl-
edge that this professor had could
not compare to the literary qualifi-
cations of someone else.

Pitt does not realize the grave
mistake it has made in letting him

go.
He has coached and guided me

. in my writing and has helped me to

discover a thing called confidence.
The impact he has made on the
journalism world and on each and
every one of his students is nothing
less than remarkable.
He truly cares, and from some of

PAGE 10

the things I have seen here at Pitt,
that means a lot.

I will return to Pitt next fall as a
senior. Some courses that I take I
will like, and others I won't like so
much. ’

There will be time for studying,
time for a job and a little time left
over for fun. But something will be
missing.

The presence of that professor
has been a major factor in my

college and personal success, and
there will never be enough that I
or any of my classmates could do
to thank him.

Among my many other goals in

'life, I have added one more: If I

can someday amount to be half of
the person that this man is, then I
will have accomplished far more
than I ever could have dreamed.
Pitt is supposed to exist for its
students. But this time the univer-
sity has gotten its priorities mixed
up. Somewhere along the line, the
definition of «“teacher" got lost.
Although he far from needs it, I

the next institution will gain in

Knowledge Doesn't Reign Supreme in KRS-1

I am writing in response to the
article about KRS-1 that appeared
in the Thursday Showcase section.

I feel that the things this man said
' were offensive and were down-

right lies.
The first thing that I must dis-

, agree with is his assertion that

“everything the black race has
gotten in this country, they’ve gotten
through shedding their blood.” He
makes it sound like white people
have not played any part in the
civil-rights movement, which is
simply not true. After all, was it not
white men that proposed (and

passed) the Civil Rights Act of

1964, the 14th and 13th Amend-
ments and the Emancipation Proc-
lamation? Indeed, all of them were
white, and so were most of the
people that participated in the
protests that brought about these
legislative acts. Refusing to recog-
nize the fact that white people
have played a large part in the
onset of civil rights is to be ignorant
of the truth.

Another thing that I found dis-
turbing in the article was the quote
that said, “You either fight for Af-
rica, or you fight for America.” He
then made the analogy that fight-
ing for America was to “ﬁght for the
slavemaster.” I find this remark
particularly offensive, for I have
relatives that have fought for
America, and I know that they
would disagree with that accusa-
tion. Ialso know that the hundreds
of thousands of soldiers who fought
(and gave their lives) for the North
during the Civil War would also
disagree with this vile statement.

KRS-1 tells black people that
their rightful homeland is in Africa

and [says that] those blacks that
might not want to go back are
suffering from “amnesia.” The idea

Letters

that all blacks return to Africa
sounds similar to white suprema-
cists’ demands of the same. As for
his insistence that “the black man

here in America is a slave,” well,

this is pure bunk, for slavery has
not existed in this country for 127
years. Andin that time, black people
have risen to prominent positions
in society. Today, the mayors of all
of America’s largest cities are all
black. I would hardly call that
slavery.

I have expressed just some of my
outrage over this article. I feel that

KRS-1's comments reek of racism
and that the article was used to
propagate his diatribe [against] the
white man. I urge everyone, blacks
and whites, to be aware of this
kind of person, [who] preaches the
same kind of racism as the Ku Klux
Klan, but only in a much more

subtle way.

Tatusko says "Union, No!"

I am responding toJeff T atusko’s
article on the Greyhound strike
(The Pitt News, April 2, 199o).[...]
Perhaps if Jeff had done a minute
amount of research on the subject,
he would not have made the same
comments. Being the son of a
Greyhound driver, Ivfeel that I have
a right and an obligation to make

this response. I would pose a
question to Jeff: Have you person-
ally observed any Greyhound driver
committing an act ofviolence? And
as far as random termination, would
you be so quick to respond if you

were in the same position? Let us -

say an unidentified person was
seen using violence in a racial
dispute on the Pitt campus. Mr.

Posvar decides to terminate 10 ‘

students randomly. And you, Jeff,
are one of those 10. Personally, I
think it’s a damn good idea not to
print writer’s notes on a subject
that he/she obviously has no bear-
ing on. Do you even know what a
union stands for, Jeff? If you are
curious, contact me, and I will put

you in touch with my father.

On Caro, LB] and the Means of Ascent...

It is not uncommon for the
friends, loved ones and supporters
of fallen politicians — from Rich-
ard Nixon to Jim Wright — to
blame the media for the pitfalls
suffered by these men. For those
who criticize the messenger for
bringing the message, I advise
reading Robert A. Caro’s Means of
Ascent, the second installment of
his biography of Lyndon Baines
Johnson.

Means of./iscentcovers the years
from 1941 to 1948, fromJohnson’s
first, unsuccessful bid for election
to the U.S. Senate to his defeat over
Coke Stevenson for the same of-
fice. While reading, I could only
think: Where were the journalists?

In his introduction, Caro writes
of “those threads, bright and dark”

that “run side by side through most ‘

of Lyndon Johnson’s life." He ac-
knowledges the existence of the
bright threads when Johnson was
elected to the the House of Repre-
sentatives in 1937, when he be-
came Senate majority leader in the
1950s and when he was president
of the United States. However, Caro
notes that “the two threads do not
run sideby side in this volume. The
bright one is missing.”

This is sad but true. After losing
the Senate race in 1941, Johnson
lost interest in and neglected his
duties as a representative, with
years passing between the times
that he spoke out on an issue. He
entered the military, as he prom-
ised his constituents he would in
time of war, but he spent most of
his World War II experience tour-

ing shipyards in California and,

trying to get former President Fran-
klin Delano Roosevelt to give him
a desk job in Washington, D.C. His
actual combat time included one

mission in the South Paciﬁc. Never-
theless, MacArthur awarded him
the Silver Star, which LBJ wore
after he campaigned and grossly
exaggerated his war experience.

 

ou
Grieco

During these years, one thing
Johnson did not forget about was
his personal finances. With some-
what shady help from wealthy
supporters, a radio station was
purchased in the name of Lady
Bird Johnson — Johnson would
always claim he had nothing to do
with the business, although his
friends knew the truth — that set

0 the Johnsons on the road to mil-

lionaire status.

Throughout this time, Johnson
was rarely questioned about any of
these matters by reporters. In
Washington, D.C., he was known
as a liar, but none of the journalists
challenged his war record. Under
Texas law, the spouse of someone
who purchases property owns none
of it but does own half of the

interest from the property. No one
caught that, either.

However, the worst happened.
during the 1948 election, which
Johnson “won” by 87 votes. (Since

his political career would have
been over had he not won this
time, you could theorize that we
got the Vietnam War and the Great
Society for 87 votes.) However, the
journalists missed the boat on this
as well.

Means of Ascent produces ir-
refutable evidence that Johnson
stole this election. Running against
a man whose integrity had never
been questioned in Texas politics,
Johnson engaged in a smear cam-
paign that would make Lee Atwa-
ter look like Abe Lincoln. In this
case, many of these “objective
journalists" helped him. At a press
conference in Washington,
Johnson, though claiming he did
not, got several reporters to hound
Stevenson for supporting a popu-
lar bill. Several neutral reporters
had to stop them; one is quoted as
saying, “It was lousy. It was one of
the lousiest things I ever saw."

Two of the reporters in the room,
husband and wife Leslie and Liz
Carpenter, who reported for Texas
newspapers, led the attack. It is
interesting to note that Liz Carpen-
ter later worked for Johnson as
executive assistant to the vice
president and served as .a top aide
to Mrs. Johnson during LBJ’s presi-
dency.

The biggest crime of the election
was the stealing of the votes. The
evidence shows that Johnson
bought thousands of votes from
the men who controlled the inner-
city ghettos and the largely Mexi-
can-American counties in south-
ern Texas, which resembled ba-

nana republics more than parts of
the United States. In fact, Steven-
son was named as the winner by
157 votes for six days, until it was
announced that 202 additional

votes (200 for Johnson, 2 for Ste-
venson) hadn't been tabulated in
Jim Wells County, which was
controlled by George Parr, who
made quite a fortune selling votes
to Johnson that year.

Stevenson journeyed south with
a few associates; while looking at
the list of people who voted, they
were able to find people who
swore in court that they hadn't
voted, along with people who
couldn’t vote — being deceased.
Controversy ensued, but Johnson
was able to beat the rap through
political deals and legal techni-
calities, and he defeated a more
honest (and less financed) candi-
date.

So, where were the journalists?
Some questioned the situation -
but not enough to counter
Johnson's well-financedbombard-
ment of denials and lies. Steven-
son ran out of time and money,
and Johnson was put on the bal-
lot as the Democratic nominee.
He easily defeated the Republi-
can candidate in what was once a
one-party state, and Stevenson
retired from politics.

Though Caro gives Johnson
credit for some of the brighter
spots of his own career, Caro
poses the question: “To what

extent are ends inseparable from -

the means?” He adds that, “Of all
the questions raised by the life of
Lyndon Baines Johnson, no ques-
tion is more important than that."
This is being asked in 1990;‘ no
one at the time, including the
people paid to question politi-
cians, thought to ask this in 1948.

Economic problems: pinning the tail on the donkey

When Pennsylvania Gov. Dick
Thornburgh left office in 1987, he
left a financially sound state with a
$300 million surplus. At that time,
the state funded the University of
Pittsburgh well, and the Pennsylva-
nia Higher Education Assistance
Agency was able to assist those
students who needed help financ-
ing their education. At that time, the
University of Pittsburgh paid the
city of Pittsburgh its fair share of
taxes for the profit-making ven-
tures of Pitt, a non-profit institution.
These mutual obligations among
Pitt and state and local govern-
ments allowed the university to
attract and keep top—notch profes-
sors through aggressive recruitment
and fair compensation, as well as
attracting and keeping students
through fair tuition hikes and the
promise of state financial aid.

_. Today, after four years of Casey's
Democratic administration, the state
is more than a billion dollars in debt
(if the creative bookkeeping is
ignored), leading the administra-
tion to cut Pitt’s allocation drasti-
cally. This has led to a restrictive
hiring freeze, as President Wesley
Posvar became very uncertain of
Pitt’s financial health. PHEAA’s fund

has been borrowed from so much
to pay for the bloated ﬁscal ma-
chine, that unless the state legisla-
ture comes to the rescue, the agency
simply will not exist by this fall.
And in city government, Pittsburgh
City Council and Mayor Sophie
Masloff have teamed up to raise
revenue in the face of a drastically
declining population by going af-
ter the university for more tax
money instead of cutting the fat
out of city services that used to
serve many more people.

With such ﬁnancial stress in
higher education in Pittsburgh, it
will not be surprising to see the
quality of education at this univer-
sity decline somewhat, while tui-
tion rises sharply and the capacity
of studenﬁx to pay is severely
hampered. The ordeal of paying
for college will be severe for par-
ents and students already sacrific-
ing rnuch to attend — indeed,
several students may be forced to
“postpone” their studies. Without
a doubt, Democratic policies im-
plemented by Democrats in the
governor’s mansion and downtown
Pittsburgh have created this crisis
that is hurting lower— and middle-
class families with college-age sons

and daughters.

Yet the Democratic Party contin-
ues to proclaim itself the party of
the working class and the common

 

Rob
Lewis

man. This is such an irony, when
one considers that the lower and
middle classes suffer most under
Democratic leadership. The ﬁscal
irresponsibility, extreme debt and
failed programs of the Casey
administration and of Pittsburgh
City Council may also be seen in
the Democratic administrations of
Mario Cuomo in New York, Mi-
chael Dukakis in Massachusetts and

in the presidential administration
of Jimmy Carter. These examples
are hardly “black sheep” of t’ e
party; indeed, the Democrats hold
them up as shining examples of
their ideals and policies.

The party of the commoner has
moved away from policies that
would truly beneﬁt him, endors-
ing instead the unworkable ideal-
ism of ivory-tower liberals totally
isolated from the problems the
less afﬂuent face. Is it any won-
der, then, that the Republican
Party is growing far faster than

the Democratic Party? Should ,

anyone be surprised that the
Democratic Party is increasingly
becoming divided or that they
haven’t won a national election
in nearly 14 years? And could the
phenomenon of the “Reagan
Democrats” be discounted as a
fluke? The only answer to these
questions is that Americans are
quite fed up with bankruptcy,
failure and incompetence and
have moved away from a party
that has provided only this.

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

VonAppen brings 25 years experience to Pitt

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Louis_Riddick walks by the door
of the Pitt football team’s locker
room, where a reporter is talking
to the Panthers’ new defensive
coordinator Fred vonAppen.

“Hey, Coach!” Riddick says, “I
was watching a tape of the NFC
Championship from a few years
ago, 49ers-Bears, and there you
were, standing on the sidelines,
this far from the camera,” Riddick
says, gesturing with his hands not
so far apart.

“Yeah, it was pretty cold that
day,” answers vonAppen, almost
bashfully, while giving Riddick a
“Hey, anyone can do it with a lot

of work and discipline,” kind of

look. ‘

Turning back to the reporter,
vonAppen says, “Now, what do
you want to do a story on me for?
I’m a boring guy.”

That’s vonAppen’s approach to
the game after 25 years of
_ coaching. During

that time,
however, he’s learned a little
something about the game. After
all, he’s worked his way up the
coaching ladder, beginning with
Centennial High in Gresham, Ore.
back in 1964, all the way to the
San Francisco 49er’s, from 1983-
88 and currently to the Pitt
Panthers.

“Except for Pop Warner, I guess

As the Lady Panther gymnastics

team closed out the 1989-90 .

season by placing sixth in the
Northeast NCAA Regional

> Championships at Ohio State last

Saturday, one of its own team
members walked away with a
perfect record.

Kathy Wallish is a junior
performing in the all-around
competition for the Lady Panthers,
and during this past season, she
did not fall once during any of

that you could say I’ve coached
every level of the game," said
vonAppen.

VonAppen came to the
Panthers in February after
spending a year at Stanford
University, where he was
defensive coordinator and
defensive-line coach. He’ll pick
up those duties at Pitt, as well as
the title of assistant head coach
under Paul Hackett. ~

Despite a quarter century_in
the business, however, vonAppen
has never been a head coach.
Not that he hasn’t been asked.

“I've had a plethora of offers,”
vonAppen said, “but either the
timing wasn’t right, or the program
wasn’t right, or the level wasn’t
right. I may never even want to
do that. Most of the time it’s just
a dice roll.”

By now, vonAppen has seen
and done it all, and at every level.
Except for five years at'Arkansas
(1972-76) and his stint with the
49ers, vonAppen has never spent
more than two years at a program
before leaving. The list is long -
Centennial, Medford (Ore) High,
Linfield (Ore) College, Arkansas,
U.C.L.A., Virginia Tech, Oregon,
Stanford, Green Bay Packers,
Arkansas again, Stanford again,
49ers, Stanford ‘again and Pitt.
That’s 14 stops in 25 years if
you're counting. So why Pitt?

her routines.

“After the meet, Kathy came up
to me and said that it was now
safe to say that she had not fallen
all year,” said head coach Debbie
Yohman.

Wallish is described by some
of her teammates as a very strong-
willed and determined girl.

“She’s a very good friend, one
that you can always depend on,”
said freshman all-around
competitor Kim Miller. “She’s a
lot of fun to be around.”

During Saturday’s competition,
Wallish scored a 5580, which

PAGE 12

tied her with teammate Beth
Dyson for 22nd in the
competition.

“I hope that her senior year
goes as well as this year,” said
Dyson. “She has been improving
all season, and I hope that she
keeps improving.

“A lot of girls peak during high
school and stay pretty much even
in college, butl don’t feel thatshe
has peaked yet,” added Dyson.

At the NCAA Regionals, Wallish
scored an 8.90 on the uneven
parallel bars. Although the bars
used at Regionals were different

from those that the Lady Panthers
use at home, Wallish said that
they did not hinder her
performance too much.

“I adjusted to [the bars] during
workouts,” said Wallish, “It was
just different.”

“Kathy’s bar routine was her
worst,” said Yohman, “She didn’t
fall, but she also didn’t stick any
of her handstands. She is a
consistent performer.”

“I think that Kathy is one of the
consistent performers we have,”
said junior Robyn Borchers. “I
feel that it is a shame that she’s

At the present moment, the

girls with walk-on status
(including Wallish) and Shelly
Sleith, who was awarded the Myra

Athletes are often thrust into position of role model

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

September 1985. Pete Rose laces a line
drive to left ﬁeld off San Diego Padres’
pitcher Eric -Show, surpassing Ty Cobb as
baseball’s all—time hit leader.

The Riverfront Stadium crowd rises to its
feet in unison to salute the man that is such
a hero in the city of Cincinnati that he has
a street named after him.

August 1989. Pete Rose is banished from
the game for alleged gambling on baseball.

Rose, one of the most popular figures in
the world of sports, is one of many athletes

. whose role—model status has recently been

destroyed. Many athletes don’t realize the
effect they have when they let their fans
down.

An article in USA Today said, “When a
hero falls from grace, children can be
overcome with feelings ofshock and grief
almost as painful as coping with a death.”

In today’s big-money, high-visibility
world of sports, whether athletes like it or
not, they are role models who are placed
on pedestals above society and reality.
But when these heroes fail, the impact on
their fans, especially children, can‘ be
devastating.

“Kids usually build up a hero to a
flawless image," said Kevin Swick, director
of the University of South Carolina
Children's Center, ina recent interview.
“When that changes, it’s like hitting your
hand with a hammer. There’s a shock to
the system.” '

When 40 third—grade students were asked
who do they most admire, 10 (25 percent)
answered with an athlete’s name. One
boy said he most admires Joe Montana
because he “made me like football.” One
girl said Pele because “he’s great at soccer
and inspired me to do the best I can.”

Should athletes be given the
responsibility of being role models to

people they don’t even know? Many people
feel this is an irrelevant question.

“Once you accept the responsibility of
being an athlete, you automatically accept
that role,” said Tom Ricketts, a former Pitt
offensive lineman who currently plays for
the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ricketts feels
that being a role model is a given whether
the athlete likes it or not. He said it goes
with the fame and glory.

Ricketts’ approach to being a role model
centers around his overall demeanor. He
said it’s important to be yourself by being
a down-to—earth person. “Treat people as
you wish others to treat yourself,” he said.
He feels you should always look out for
yourself and present yourself as being
someone to look up to.

Marine Parascenzo, a Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette sportswriter, has a similar view. ‘‘I
don’t know if athletes should be role
models, but the fact of the mattei is they
are,” he said.

He said they have to recognize that their
position of prominence means that they
are not just anybody. “Anyone who doesn’t
realize that lives in a tree,” said Parascenzo.

Former Pittsburgh Pirates manager
Chuck‘Tanner also feels the athlete has a
large obligation. “They have to do what
the ball club wants,” he said. He also said
the athlete has to do everything possible
to contribute as much as he can. He did
emphasize that the fans‘ have to realize
that the athlete can’t doit all.

Tanner feels that it is very good for kids
to look at sports figures as role models.
“This is the best country in the world, and
sports is what makes our country great,”
he said.

He said that athletes have the ability to
do something everyone dreams of; thus, it

is healthy and good to put them on a _

pedestal. “You have to have dreams, reach
high, reach for the stars,” he said.

PITT BASEBALL ‘WINS MORE BIG EAST GAMES

Since breaking their 25-game conference losing streak, the Pitt
baseball team has now won three of their last four Big East games.
In a weekend stint against Georgetown, the Panthers won the first
contest 5-2, dropped the second game 10-3 and blew out the Hoyas
in the ﬁnal game 12-5. Bill Brash picked up the victory for the
Panthers in the Opener. Errors plagued the Panthers throughout the
second game as Fred Iriti, last week’s Big East Pitcher of the Week,
took the loss. Keith Wilson’s 3-run homer in the third game helped
Desmond Schnur collect the win.

 

ELLIS STARS FOR MEN 

Pitt’s Elbert Ellis captured first place in the 110-meter hurdles
Saturday in 13.8 seconds at the Dogwood Relays in Knoxville,
Tennessee. Ellis also teamed with Franz Dobson, Chappale Burton
and Dave Moore to win the sprint medley relay in a time of 3: 19.42.
Ellis, Burton, Todd Walthall, and Will Brown took second in the
shuttle hurdles relay (57.44), and Tom Swartwort took second in the
steeplechase. '

 DEMAS LEADS THE WOMEN

Keisha Demas took third place in the 400meter race, and teamed
with‘ Clarissa Dudley, Ronise Crumpler, and Vanessa Jones finished
second in the 800m medley relay in 1:36.03. Pitt captured ﬁrst place
in the 400-meter relay race, and Mary Allison Williams finished third
in the 100—hurd1es.

PIRATES SQUEAK BY CUBS .

Andy Vanslyke raced home from second base on Sid Bream’s
single in the bottom of the tenth inning yesterday, giving the
Pittsburgh Pirates a 4-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs. Bob Patterson
got the win and the Pirates who improved to 3-3. Earlier in the game,
Bobby Bonilla cracked his second homer of the year, a three-run
blast.

REDS REDS REDS

The Cincinnati Reds remained the only undefeated team in the
major leagues by beating the Atlanta Braves 13-6 yesterday. Eric
Davis and Chris Sabo each blasted 3—run homers for Cincinnati. The

“I liked the opportunity to win
here. I was impressed with the
people, not just the coaches and
the academicians, but the players
as well,” vonAppen said. “I liked
their attitude, their belief. They
expect to win.”

VonAppen said that’s pretty
much how he’s picked all the
positions that he’s held. And with
success at every level now tucked
under his belt, VonAppen can
almost pick and choose, and he
chooses the collegiate level.

“I like all the color and
pageantry at this level,” said
VonAppen. “Plus at this level, I
think that, coaching-wise, you
have a developmental impact on

Ditka scholarship established

Former Pitt football player
Mike Ditka, currently the head
football coach of the NFL’s
Chicago Bears, has"'made a
contribution to the university
that will be used for the
establishment of a 100,000 dollar

endowed scholarship.
The Mike Ditka Endowed
Scholarship Fund was

established by Ditka in the form
of a 10,000 dollar annual gift
over a 10-year period.
According to Robert
Heddleston, assistant athletic
director for development, the
fund will provide valuable
scholarship assistance to both
male and female varsity athletes
at Pitt who have distinguished
themselves in‘ athletic
competition and in academics.
The scholarships will be
appropriated for prospective Pitt
student athletes from the Beaver
Valley area, Ditka’s birthplace.

“I think life is all about paying
your dues,” said Ditka. “There
were a lot of people that helped

"Mike Ditka along the way and

the University of Pittsburgh
certainly played an important
role during my formative years.
I am delighted to be able to
give back something to the
University and at the same
time help someone in life,
especially someone from my
hometown, to get a college
education and have a chance
to succeed in life.”

Ditka, a former, multi-sport
athlete at Pitt, was an All-
American tight end in 1960, his
senior year. He led the Panthers
in receiving three consecutive
years. Ditka was also a
linebacker and punter, and
played basketball and baseball
at Pitt. He was captain of the
1960 football squad.

In his pro career, Ditka

earned A1l—Pro honors and was
a member of the Chicago Bears’
1963 NFL Championship team
and the Dallas Cowboys’ Super
Bowl VI championship team.
Ditka worked as an assistant
coach at Dallas for nine seasons
and, in that time, was part of
another Dallas Super Bowl
championship team.

This fall Ditka begins his
eighth year as head coach of
the Bears.

Ditka is Pitt’s only alumnus to .

be enshrined in both the Pro
and College Football Hall of
Fame.

“The pride the University of 0

Pittsburgh has long felt for Mike
Ditka as an alumnus athlete,
and coach has been raised to an
ever higher level by the
commitment he has made to an
endowed scholarship for Pitt
Athletics,”
Director Edward E. Bozik.

Ralph Cindrich, former All-
American Pitt football player and
wrestler, played four seasons in
the NFL with the Houston Oilers
and the New England Patriots.
He is now a sports agent and also
feels that athletes must accept
their role-model status.
“Anyone coming into the game
who doesn’t appreciate their
obligation needs to be sat down

and talked to,” he said. He feels

the athlete has an obligation to
conduct himself in an exemplary
manner, especially for the sake
of children. He said you win fans
over when they are young.

Cindrich does feel that there is
a sharp line between the public
and private lives of athletes. He
said that the athlete does have
many obligations when in public,
but the fans should also respect
the athletes’ rights to have private
lives.

Not everybody involved with
the world of sports feels that
athletes have much of a duty to
be role models. There are those
that feel that athletic ability doesn't
translate into an obligation and
feel that role models should be
found in the home.

John Papanek of Sports

Illustmtedwrote, “Isn't it time we
stopped turning every successful
athlete into a role model? Who
decreed that simply because
someone can shoot a basketball
or hit a backhand or throw a
fastball better than 99 percent of
the population, he or she is better
than everyone else and therefore
must set an example for millions
of adoring youngsters so they
don't grow up to be drug addicts
or car thieves?”

Papanek said that children have
to be taught that athletes are
human and susceptible to the
same problems as other people.
“Today, we can’t be certain that
our athletes won’t turn out to be
drug abusers. Nor can we be
certain that our children,
husbands, wives, teachers and
best friends won’t, ” said Papanek.

New York Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor, who has

violated the NFL substance abuse

NINE MONTH

policy several times, feels that
society expects too much from

athletes. In a recent interview, he ,

said, “Educators and parents want
me to know that I'm a role model
for their children. I tell them: You
are the role models, especially
you parents. Don't put it off on
people you ‘don't even know."

When asked to respond to
T aylor’s thoughts, Ricketts said,
“It's an arrogant statement from a
man who doesn't think before he
speaks.”

Gene Upshaw, executive
director of the NFL Players’
Association and former Oakland
Raider, said in a recent interview,
“If some members of our society
choose to regard pro athletes as
role models, this does not mean
that the athletes must accept such
a mantle.”

Rick Telander of Sports
Illustrated feels the responsibility
is in the home. He wrote that
parents might be avoiding their
role-model duty by putting it off
on athletes. He feels that kids are
more influenced by their peers
and parents than by athletes.

Neil Cohen of SPORTmagazine
seems to feel that athletes have a
minimal obligation. He wrote,
“When they leave the field, we
have no right to put enormous
pressure on those athletes to be
any more than we can be. It isn’t
fair, and it doesn't work."

Whether the athletes or the
parents are responsible,
psychologists have found that
children need to have people to
follow. They stress that it could
be damagin to children when
their heroes let them down.

New York University
psychologist Lawrence Balter said
in a recent interview, “Children
need good role models if they are
to grow up to be decent and
productive adults.” He added, “As
teenagers, we are deeply
impressed by particular
performers and athletes.”

William Damon, a Clark
University psychology professor,
spoke in a recent interview about
the possible effects when
children’s heroes fail. “The danger
is that children will eventually

become apathetic‘ about ethical
issues if they see adults constantly
bending rules,’ he said.

It may seem that recently there
have been many athletes who
have failed and let down their
fans. Many people feel that it
only seems that way, but the fact
is there is just more reporting of
these problems now.

There is an old story that Babe
Ruth was seen running on a train,
being chased by a naked woman
with a knife. One reporter looked
at another and said, “It's a good
thing we didn't see that.” Today
that story would be in Sports
Illustrated, every newspaper and
on the ESPN Sportcenter.

One example of increased
reporting was in 1987 when
SPORTprinted a two-page police
blotter subtitled, “More than 180
sports ﬁgures fought the law in
the past year. Here are 50 who
didn't win‘."

‘The blotter included a variety
of offenses such as ex-
Philadelphia Eagle Kevin Allen
being sentenced for rape and

Stanley Wilson, who was

suspended from the NFL twice in
the year for drug use. He was

later banned from the NFL for
failing a drug test on the eve of
the 1989 Super Bowl. It also
included Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell
Wiggins, Houston Rockets guards
who were banned from the NBA
for cocaine use.

Parascenzo agrees there may
have been a fair share of problems
in the past, but they just weren't
reported. He said athletes are far
more visible now, thanks to
television, magazines and
commercials. With more people
watching athletes, his message to
them is, “You owe them more."

Parascenzo feels that a big part
of the athlete's increased visibility
is all the endorsements they
partake in today. He feels that by
exposing themselves more, their
obligation increases. He did say
that you have to realize that
athletes could have failures and
still be admirable people.

One athlete who knows about
making himself visible through

endorsements is Michael Jordan
of the Chicago Bulls. He has
become the top commercial
endorser among team-sport
professionals and realizes the

obligations that go with his stature. ‘

In a recent interview, he said, “I
may be fortunate to be respected,
to show positive role-model traits.
Everybody’s' benefiting from this,
even though I didn't ask to be put
in this position. ' It's something
I've accepted."

One common statement is that

there is too much pressure put on '

the athletes. Parascenzo strongly
disagrees. “If you want to tell me
about pressure, show me the
Midwest farmer facing a drought, ”
he said. He feels the only pressure
an athlete has is resisting various
temptations.

Cindrich also does not believe
there is too much pressure on the
athletes. He said that athletes
know that they'll have other
obligations. He feels that athletes
have a license to play sports, and
that license can be revoked.

When Cindrich was playing football, he believed in his position as
a role model and did anything he could to help. He said that when
he was at Pitt, he participated in anything that came up, including
going to local schools to teach disadvantaged kids how to play
football.

 

graduated from law school in Houston. He has been representing
football players as an agent since 1977. His clients include Herschel
Walker, A] Toon, Gerald Riggs, Gary Anderson and former Pitt
players Mark May, Bill Fralic and Mark Stepnoski.

As an agent, Cindrich still feels as though he has a duty to be a role
model. He feels that responsibility does not lie solely with the
athletes. He said that everybody involved with sports has an
obligation to promote it.

In these days when many agents such as Lloyd Bloom and Norby
Walters are associated with sleaziness and corruption, Cindrich has
risen above it. The February edition of Pro Football Weelely rated him
as one ofthe top live football agents, along with Marvin Demoff, jack
Mills, "Leigh Steinberg and Bob Woolf.

Besides his skills as a great negotiator, he has built up a reputation
of honesty and fairness. The story in Pro Football Weekly said he has
lots of class and sensational ethics. The Pittsburgh Press said,
“Cindrich is eminently qualified [for his occupationl,‘as a former All-
American, one—time NFL player, lawyer, and most importantly, a man
of utmost integrity.”

“My clients are a cut above,” said Cindrich. “Every one of them are
role models.” When looking for clients, Cindrich looks for more than
athletic ability. He looks for players that have the character and ability
to handle the responsibility of being a professional athlete. As a result
of his finding quality people, he has never had a client drafted in the
first four rounds that didn’t make it into the NFL. A
 . Cindrich said that his clients know how to respond in the
 _  exemplary manner expected of them. He’ll pass by people that he

 ' feels won’t act accordingly. ‘

One positive example is the Philadelphia Eagles’ quarterback Don
McPherson. Cindrich describes him as an articulate, classy individual
who does what he says he will do. He said that he can be counted
on to show up where he is supposed to.

The world of sports has many examples of positive role models

if someone had done that for me
when I was a kid.”

Doug Williams, who was
recently released by the
Washington Redskins, created the
Doug Williams Foundation, which
provides college scholarships,
motivational sports programs,
anti—dropout and anti-drug
programs, and leadership and
life-skills training for Washington,
D.C. area kids. Williams also
frequently visits schools.

. John Lucas, currently a Houston
Rocket, believes the saying, “Just

say no” isn't enough. He wants
kids to know what they're saying
no to and why. Lucas speaks
from experience, since he has
overcome a dependency on drugs
and alcohol. \

He visits schools around the
country representing STAND --
Students Taking Action, _Not
Drugs. In a recent interview, Lucas
said, “Being an athlete gave me
an arena in which to help these
kids, to show them the impact
drugs and alcohol have on a
family and how important it is to
say ‘no.’ “

Cindrich feels that with the
athlete's exposure constantly
increasing, the obligation as a
role model will continue to grow.
There is now a daily newspaper
entitled The National, devoted
almost entirely to sports. Many
American sports, such as football
and basketball, have been
bringing their games to other
countries. There is even talk of
some of the American leagues
becoming international some time
down the road. “We are on the
horizon of times like no other
times,” said Cindrich.
