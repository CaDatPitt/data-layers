In Tribute to Irvine

Five books, donated by the English Competition Honors
Group, were recently received by the library as a tribute to

High School Girls
Need Dance Dates

Because of complaints about the
number of high school girls at SU
dances, the Student Union Board's

' New Social Committee, under Les

- Plack, will require date tickets for
students coming _ to -the dances

. with non—University dates. Date

tickets are attainable at the SU
desk before 5 p.m. on the day of
the dance.

On May 25, the SU will have
its ﬁrst patio dance, “May Mad-
ness,” for which the committee
is trying to get the Chessmen.
Another affair that the commit-
tee is planning is a hayride-
dance at South Park. Chartered
buses will bring the dates to,
South Park.

Area Cleaning Problem
.=.;Noticed By Engineer
Editor, The Pitt News: 
As you may know, quite a few
streets have been closed to park-
ing in Oakland on Monday and
Tuesday for street cleaning. This
exaggerates the already serious
Tparking problem for students.
Possibly the University Planners
don’t realize the need for a stu-
dent parking lot. But‘ I’ll bet
they’d think a little harder about
‘it ifthey had to join the eight
]o’clock scramble for parking
spaces and then walk to school
from Center Avenue.

William Shuker
Engineer - Senior

Department Chairman

Cites Broad Program

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have read with considerable
, approbation the letter of three

. engineering students in The Pitt
News of May 1, regarding the
breadth of the engineering cur-
 riculum. However, these stu-
dents greatly understand the
B case for Engineering.

Their statement that 21 per
cent of the Engineering curric-
ulum is in Liberal Arts is quite
misleading and should have read
that 21 per cent of the curric-
_u1um (30 credits) are Liberal
Arts electives. In addition to
these 30 credits, there are many
required courses in the academic
disciplines. _ _,

Our engineering curricula to-
day require that, of the 145
credits required for an Engin-
eering degree, an average of 77
are taken in the academic dis-
ciplines. In some departments
over 80 credits are required in
Liberal Arts, as the 30 credits
of electives are divided equally

  The

. Sciences.

   

Use 0] Americu°:Frfa7lt7ul

between Humanities ~.-and Social

All engineering students also
take from eight to 20 credits in
each of the three natural sci-
ences in the academic disciplin-
es. Is this program narrower
than that of liberal arts?

The handbook for Liberal
Arts ‘students states that taking
over 40 credits in one ﬁeld tends
to produce too much specializa-
tion. In my own department,
petroleum engineering, only 24
departmental credits are re-_
quired, and the average engin-
eering curriculum carries only 36
credits in the departmental spe-
cialization. Is this a narrow pro-
gram?

It seems high time that Lib-
eral _ Arts students and faculty
alike become more familiar with
the nature of the engineering
programs here. Dr. John Cal-
houn, vice-president of Texas
A&M College, recently made the
following statement, in which I
heartily concur:

“It is because of the revolu-
tion producing nature of en-
gineering that the total academic
community musthave an under-
standing of it and take its forces
into account. A study of its con-
cepts and subject matter should
be at the very 1/ieart of our aca-
demic programs along with the
study of other forces that are a
part of man’s history and
future.”

If the Liberal Arts students
and faculty would take some
time to become familiar with the
engineering programs here, there

would be less unjust criticism.

a nd better 'co-operation all
around which would greatly
beneﬁt the University’s total un-
dergraduate program.

Poor Teachers Part-C2 . :.

Course Critique

“Three times a week Mr. Barghoorn wanders
along aimlessly for 50 minutes, repeating much of
the material covered in the reading . . . his dull
monotone, his lack of organisation . . . tend to make
Mr. Ban-ghoorn.’s lectures often ’
not worth while.”

The above passage, quoted is a
recent issue of Newsweek is from
the “Course Critique” issue by the
Yale Daily News. It is one way in

their contemporaries through the
maze of reputations that college
teachers collect. A critique that
generally takes the tone of the
passage quoted would be open to 

charges of cuteness certainly and, ,
perhaps, of irresponsibility. Of course, the tone
used is only one of many that are possible.

The theory behind course critiques is sound,
though, and the need is real. One of the most mem-
orable “Little Man on Campus” cartoons publish-
ed in The Pitt News showed a_ battery of monkeys
seated at typewriters working on a new‘ course
catalogue for Worthal’s college, While the course

catalogue at“ our institution is assembled with re-. ’

gard to more things’ than random chance, the course
descriptions tend to make everything available
sound like the" opportunity of a lifetime and stu-
dents must depend upon‘ teachers’ reputations‘ to
help them make their selections.
A Valid Question . _

Since a need for further _information does exist,
a; valid question is whether or not students could
publish a worthwhile course critique, one that re-
sponsible" administrators would not seek ‘to squash.

Albert B. Martin, dean of the School, of Liberal
Arts, thinks that it wo'uld.be possible, “If done with
a full sense of responsibility, then I see nothing
wrong with it,” he said in an interview. f‘But I
would hate to see a course critique published that
was written in bitterness or with a goal of retalia-
tion. It could be good if it gave a fair representa-
tion of student opinion.”

 

By Barry Gross

Dr. Martin has seen the course critique issued
by students at Harvard and ﬁnds it “on the whole,

reasonable.” The University of Pennsylvania’s crit-
ique seemed to be 66 percent accurate on the peo-
ple he knows prsonally, Dr. Martin said. There
would be a great need, he cautioned, not to use
one sentence to “pin down a teacher’s whole edu-
cational impact on one characteristic.”

If it is possible to produce a coursecritique that
is accurate and is in good taste than the next ques-
tion to consider is whether or not students have the
right to do so. ‘

Concern, is Important

Dr. Martin believes that “ it is important for a
student body to exercise concern for the quality" of
the education _that the institution is providing.” And

I believe that the student body has the right. Edu--

cation has become big business. The thousands of
graduate college education often represent hard
dollars spent by parents and students for "under-
work and tremendous sacriﬁces. This is not money
to be spent lightly. In order to spend it wisely, each
student should have all the information necessary

:to help him make a wise choice, before he makes.

his “purchase” of a course. The teacher who is 

‘delivering the opportunity for learning —- for the
student must work at learning — should not be

, tolerated by either students or administrators.

The general ‘excellence of the faculty here ac-
ventuates the few poor teachers-. A critique pub-
lished by responsible students," working through

the Office of Student Publications, perhaps, or per- ,

haps through Student Government, would effective,-
ly aid students in avoiding. these few poor teach-.
ers and spur the administration to act as‘ quick-
ly as possible in removing time. ‘ A I
The goodteacher will not be bothered by this
booklet. Those who want to receive additional in-
formation on how students react to their courses
could pass out questionnaires at the end of the tri-.-

‘mester, as some teachers here do already. These
-questionaires will. be discussed in this space next

Monday.

Nature and Oloiectivity . :i:

News

The Emotional Element 

By Thomas Plate

0

Politics, the art of the possible, is, as a science,
quite impossible. The conventional scientist must
act to remove himself from the scene of action as
quickly as possible. He must be disinterested, ob-
jective and emotionally unen-
volved until the moment of tri- _
umph.

But the detached researcher,
distinterestedly peering at  N
culture dishes, would at all odds, '
be trampled during the passion
of a revolution. The_ scientist 1;
does not have to include an
“emotion factor” in his calcula-
tions. For while the arena roped
off by the scientist. is annointed
with the blessed chrism of .ob-
jestivity, the open arena of politics is smeared with
non-objective phenomena.

Perhaps this is what makes the study of politics
at once fascinating and frustrating. Political action
is more often the result of impetuous emotion
than the product of rational reﬂection. _

With nature, the scientist does not expect a
sudden outburst of temper, an audacious decision,
a subconscious prodding. The scientist can under-
stand nature from a totally objective standpoint.

With politics, however, the researcher cannot
predict with a great deal of optimism a speciﬁc
political action on the basis of what would be the
most rational thing to do.

Distinction Unrecognized

I think that the importance of this distinction
is not sufficiently recognized. If one wants to
understand a particular political action, he must
achieve both an intellectual and emotional rapport
‘with the idea motivating the action. This does not

'mean that one should base his reaction to the idea‘

.on emotion. The point concerns the understanding
of the idea, not the response to it, although, un-
fortunately, the basis of both is often the same.

V What one is mainly interested in, however, is
not an abstract statement, but rather an applicable
tool. To illustrate: a few weeks ago in New York
I watched David Susskind’s “Open End.” The topic
was — guess hard — Cuba, and he had guests who
had recently been to that ferocious island: a

_ bureau chief of the New‘York Times‘ an editor of

 

gunsound and irrel

Look, a professor of economics from Rutgers, a
correspondent from the London Observer and Man-
uel Urrutia, the first president of Cuba under Fidel.
Castra. Urrutia has since ﬂed to the U.S. and be-
come one of the more rabid anti-Castroites.

Duringthis fascinating program I observed that
Urrutia consistently offered the least rational argu-
ments. The others managed to appgar unemotional,
rational, and admirably reserved. Urrutia’s com-
ments, however, consistently turned into emotional
tirades against Castro. - .

The interesting thing about the program was
that I found myself eventually in Urrutia” camp,
sneering at those Americans, those ignorant
gr1'.ngos.vI soon found myself ready to storm the
streets of Havana, not because of a suddenly de-
veloped hatred of Castro, but because Urrutia was
just right, and they were wrong.

The Principle -of the Thing

That was New York, however, and this is
Pittsburgh, but there is a situation "here where
the principle is the same.

To understand the deep concern some students
have about the treatment accorded certain fellow
students here, to understand the actions of these
students who have formed a politically viable unit
speciﬁcally concerned with student relations, one
must be aware of the plurality ofﬁnon-rational ele-
ments involved. This is. not to say that irrational
tendencies pervade this“ movement;- I ﬁnd myself
opposed to that view. This is to say thatit is im-
possible. in this case to run to the top of the hill
overlooking the campus, the scene of the battle,

‘ and solemnly pronounce judgment, “Because I can

see all the action, and am myself above these pet-
ty. Childish acts, I can really understand what is
going on.” One can understand the factors involved
only if he is willing to acknowledge that man does
not always act the way the objective scientist ex-
pects nature to act. Man is more than a ping-pong
battered around by observable external forces.
Thus, given that in judging an action one is
obligated to understand it, and that in understand-
ing it one is required to achieve temporary emo-
tional rapport with the idea motivating it, a criti-
cism if a political action on the basis that...,_tho act
is not in accord with an objective approach is both

‘What Is  

Remembered’

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Alice B. Toklas, life—long bunk—buddy of Gertrude Stein,
Knew that a great many writers and readers, artists and aﬁci-
lnados will still be interested in What is Remembered (Holt,
Winston, Reinhart; 186 pp.; $4).

And Miss Toklas had a great deal to remember. The

‘§:h:~‘*‘i San Francisco earthquake was only a mild beginning for her

long and fascinating life, for by? .

attaching herself to Miss Stein dur-

ing her ﬁrst visit to Paris in the
early part of the century, she was
to find herself surrounded by the
ﬂames and tremors of several gen-
erations of creativity for the rest
of her life.

In their various masterpiece-
studded apartments. on the rue
de Whatever, beak-nosed Miss-
Toklas and barrel-shaped ‘Miss
Stein boiled tea for forty ‘years’
worth of the world’s greatest
artists. Miss Toklas,’ although
never taking her adoring eyes
away ‘from Gertrude’s Bhudda-
like carcass, manages to~mention-
most of them in her new basket

' of nostalgia:

-.3l-.4‘ \,

 

‘ Many, Many More

Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott
Fitzgerald, Ford,Madox Ford, Carl
Van Vechten, Pablo~Picasso, Henri
Matisse, Aaron Copland, James
Joyce, Thornton Wilder, Alfred
North Whitehead‘, Richard Wright,
any" many., ’many more are men-
tioned. " .

And that’s the fault or‘ the
book: they are only mentioned;

One is a bit wary of the slim-
ness of_ a book which is to ever
ﬁfty years‘ of meeting artist
after artist; Miss Toklas, much
to her reader’s disappointment,
has, for some reason, only listed
the great personalities, inter-
spersing that list with an occa-
sional useless anecdote and,
about every ﬁfty pages, a smat-
erting of original wit.

How anyone could ‘write of
these great people in such a bor-
ingly lifeless way is difficult to
understand. One "can only guess
that Miss Toklas remained so en-

—-raptured with the personality of

   
   

Gertrude Stein that she only re-
cognized the greatness of the par-
lor visitors because Gertrude _told
her to recognize it.
Personality Surrendered

Alice B. Toklas appears’ to have
been a woman who surrendered
her entire personality to another.
Her book shows few opinions or
judgments of her own; rather, it
was always what Gertrude
thought or said.

A phenomenal hangeron, Miss
Toklas rubbed shoulders with
the greatest of the Twenties,
Thirties and Forties and, some-
how, none of the greatness rub-
bed off. Rather, she" sems to be
perturbed ‘by the many should-
ers which were shoved between
her and Gertrude. '

Andthe result is that, with the
lifeless attitude shown toward the
great visitors to Miss Stein’s
chambers, Alice B. Toklas has
remembered only what duty has
told her to remember. The sketchy
book is what she felt people would
expect .her to remember with

fondness; but all she wants to
remember is the all-powerful

Gertrude.

young, old or Negro, but because
there aren’t enough jobs to go
around, and these are the ﬁrst
groups eliminated.

Failed to Indicate

Mr. Keyserlin-g failed to indi-
cate, however, how an- increase
in construction jobs would help
unemployed coal miners without
an even larger and much im-
proved retraining program than
at present.

Neither is the tax cut‘ pro-

posed by the Administration

the answer, he argued. The
spending program would in-
crease demand in areas so vast
that new workers must be em-
ployed. The tax cut, he asserted,
would only add to demand for
consumer goods in mass pro-
duction industries where de-
mand would increase without
an employment increase, due to
expanding technology.

According to Keyserling, the
present tax reduction plan would
not, even help the low income
families who need it. The in-

crease in after-tax income due to

the reduction would be only 2% .

for a $3000 income, but 24% for
a $200,00 income, he ﬁgured.

A Keyserling did observe one good
indication in the tax reduction
plan: the nation is learning to
place the. economy above the
“bookkeeping” process of balanc-

ing the budget. After all unem- '

ployment is a human matter; “It’s
a terrible thing—thi.s sense of be-
ing unwanted, this inability to ‘be
used.”

How TO SEE EUROPE
FOR ONLY $300 A DAY: No. 2

Last week we discussed England, the ﬁrst stop on the tour of
Europe that every American college student is going to make
this summer. Today we will take up your next stop—France,
or the Pearl of the Paciﬁc, as it is generally called.

To get from England to France, one greases one’s body and
swims the English Channel. Similarly, to get from France to
Spain, one greases one’s body and slides down the Pyrenees.
And, of course, to get from France to Switzerland, one greases
one’s _body and wriggles through the Simplon Tunnel. Thus, as
you can see, the most important single item to take to Europe
is'a'valise'full of grease. . ,

No, I am wrong. The most important thing to take to Europe
is a valise full of Marlboro Cigarettes—or at least as many as

      

 

-.
1. *:~.r

any

the customs regulations will allow. And if by chance you should

~ run out of Marlboros in Europe, do not despair. That familiar

red and white Marlboro package is as omnipresent in Europe
as it is in all ﬁfty of the United States. A11d it is the same
superb cigarette you ﬁnd at home—the same pure white ﬁlter,
the same zestful, mellow blend of tobaccos preceding the ﬁlter.
This gem of the tobacconist’s art, this prodigy or cigarette
engineering, was achieved‘ by Marlboro’s well-known research
team—Fred Softpack and Walter Fliptop—a.nd I, for one, am
grateful. _

But I digress. We were speaking of F rance-—or the Serpent of
the Nile, as it is popularly termed.

Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy sum up the history of F 1'-ance. The nation
was discovered in 1066 by Madame Guillotine. There followed
a series of costly wars with Schleswig-Holstein, the Cleveland
Indians, and Jean Jacques Rousseau. Stability ﬁnally came to
this troubled land with the coronation of l\’Ia.rsha.l Foch, who
married Lorraine Alsace and had three children: Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Charlemagne. This later became known as the Petit Trianon.

Marshal Foch——or the Boy Orator of the Platte, as he was
affectioiiately called—Was succeeded by Napoleon, who intro-
duced shortness to France. Until Napoleon the French were
the tallest nation in Europe. After Napoleon most Frenchmen
were able to walk comfortably under card tables. This later
became known as the Hunchback of N otre Dame.

Napoleon, after his defeat by Credit Mobilier, was exiled to
Elba, where he made the famous statement, “Able was I ere I
saw Elba.” This sentence reads the same whether you spell it
forward or backward. You can also spell Marlboro backward-
Oroblram. Do not, however, try to smoke Marlboro backward
because that undoes all the pleasure of the ﬁnest cigarette made.

After Napoleon’s death the French people fell into a great ﬁt
of melancholy, known as the Louisiana Purchase. For over a.
century everyone sat around moping and refusing his food.
This torpor was not lifted until Eiffel built his famous tower,
which made everybody giggle so hard that today France is the
gayest country in Europe. ‘

Each night the colorful natives gather at sidewalk cafes and

I shout “Oo-la—la!” as Maurice Chevalier promenades down the

Champs Elysees swinginghis malacca cane.'Then, tired but
happy, everyone goes to. the Louvre for bowls of onion soup.
The principal industry of France IS cashing travellers checks.
Well S11‘, I guess that’s all you need to know.about France.
Next week we will visit the Land of the Midnight Sun-Spain.
" l I 0 1963 Max Shulmal
«I5 at 4:
Next week,‘ every week, the best cigarette. you can buy the
whole world over is filter-tipped Marlboros—soft pack or

‘ Flip-‘Top box——you get a lot to like.

Panther Tracie

   
 

  
  

Beaten by Penn State

By FRANK SMIZIK
Penn State's distance runners made a shambles of the
Panther distance men by sweeping the mile run, 880-yard

. run, and a ﬁrst and third in the three mile race to win a see-
saw dual meet 73-58 at the Stadium Saturday.

The score does not show how closethe meet was. Each
team was in the lead at three different times and not -until the

‘Lion's Colin Grant put on a tre-6
‘mendous spurt in the last lap of

the grueling three mile run to beat
‘John Bailey, was the meet decid-
ed. : T‘

T h e turning '
point of thej
meet was the §
440-yard inter- 3
mediate hur-
dles. Joe Friend, ;

who looked like .
an eahy winner
couldn't clear a ’
hurdle on the ;
1 a s t b e n d. “ s
Friend, how-Bill Del Vecchio
ever, did manage to come on for
a third place.

Wins Two Others

Friend still took two first places

by copping the 120-yard high hur-
dles, and the broad jump. Friend
ran the hurdles in 14.6 while
teammate Jack Whiteford, in a
last second effort, edged out
State's George Barnhill for sec-
ond. Friend reached 22--feet-8=’:{p
inches in the broad jump.

Bill Del Veechio was the
other star for the Panthers as
he sprinted toﬁrsts in the 100
and 200-yard dashes. Del Vec-
chio edged Penn State’s Don
Gregg in both events. He won

    
  

220 in 22.0.

The other Panther runner to

manage a ﬁrst was Vance Carter.
He took his specialty the-440-yard
dash by defeating teammate Mike
Slutsky. Carter also ﬁnished third
in the 220.
Deardorf Tough

Howie Deardorf the Lion’s su-
perb distance man was a nemesis
to the Panthers all afternoon. He
took the half mile in l:56.6 and
the mile run in 4:20. Deardorf
also ran the . second leg of the
mile relay for the Lions and got
them into the lead.

The Panthers excelled in most
of the ﬁeld events. A1 Thomassey
tossed the discus 165 feet-8 inches
to defeat ’State’s Harrison Rose-
dahl. Rosedahl, however edged
Thomassey in the shot put. Ron
Weiers and Gary Meckley both

tied for first in the pole vault and.

tied a school record in doing it.
The height of 14 f:et—three inches,
also established a new stadium
record. a

George Washington is the only

the bench, and told me to stay
there, and he would have been
right. .

Like most substitutes, Yedlicka
feels he should be playing, but
harbors no hard feelings against
Coach Bobby Lewis. “Once a
coach has a winning team, he has
no reason to change it. Let’s face
it. If those guys are good enough
to be winning, they deserve to be
in there. I’ll be ready if they need
me,” he said.

Knee Trouble A V

As of late, Yedlicka has been
plagued with knee trouble, which
is a" cause of concern to Lewis as
much as him. “I don’t know what
we’ll do for inﬁelders if Yedlic_ka’s
knee goes bad,” Lewis said. “I
already had John Cioffi, our reg-
ular first baseman playing second
base.” v

But Yedlicka doesn’t think he’ll
miss many‘ games. “My knee has
to be drained at least 24 hours
before a game,” he said. “I’l1 just
have it drained early enough so
that I won’t miss any games.”
Yedlicka is prepared.
