' Dec.V29, 1915.
Dr. S.lB. McCormick, Chancellor
University of Pittsburgh.

My Dear Chancellor:——

At a joint meeting of our Advisory
Board and forty students who are -’tryV-
Ling out for this year’s production of
the Cap and Gown Club, because of
the bitter feeling against the unjust
-letters appearinglin the last issue of
the PITT WEE‘KLY‘,', a motion was
made and passed unanimously by the
students authorizing me to write and
send you the following letter:-—--

In the PITT*WEE'KL,Y of December
15, 1915, there appeared in the col-
umns devoted to the 1publica.tion of

student expression, two letters, oneV

signed “A Student”, the other “1917”.
The writers of ._.these letters are now
known to the Club and it has de-
veloped ‘thatthe former is at present
an employee of several years’ stand-
ing of the University and the latter
has served one summer as ﬁeld repre-

'VsentVative in the Department of Ex-

tension. These names can be furn-
ished upon request. ,

VWe ‘send this letter in order that
you may be advised as to the source
and
that you may know that they do not
reflect the sentiment of the student
body, but are merely instruments with
which several so-called V reformers

havesought to injure an organization 

‘tllat does as much to advertise the

Ui1iversit)’%\s any other medium now

inus-Ve. Andfurther, make the request

that you cause sucVhEdepartures--from

realloyalty to answer.1toVyouV‘-or to

us for the manner in which they have

attempted to turn student sympathy
awayfrom us at this the‘ beginning
of what pVroVmisesV to beour most suc-

cessful year. V V V

.We know that these letters were
prompj;ed;_ and urged V,not,..by the. stu-
dents of the University, but by those

who were directly responsible for

thVeiVI‘V publication, and by several
othersin the employ of this institu-
tion, who hold .a certain feeling of
distrust toward the mVeVmVbers of four
advisory board._ We know this be-
cause the letters do not reﬂect-* our
sentiments and we are Forty Of The
Students Mfost Vitally Concerned;

Taking up the letter sVig“neVd by ‘_‘A
Student” ‘(by one who is-entitled to

recognition only as a “Special Stu-

_ dent” because of his light schedule

and steady employment by .a1.depart-

ment of the University,-—-one who

does notVevenV pay" the usual student
activity -fee) we proﬁst against the

Vstatement that the Cap and! Gownfor- .

ganization ,‘‘.is in’ no sense ,repr7esenta-
t/ive ofthe student body”. As an an-
swer to this we fail to see "how an
organization cannot be representative
that isopen to as many students as

VcareVtoVtry»out for parts in the ~shVows.

The forty menwho authorize this let-
ter are forty argumentsagainst this
rashVVstatement. If these letters have
been writtenbecause the management
of the organization is not wholly stu-
dent in its character we as members

,V having a just right to speak wish to

announce our satisfaction, because we
know from the past history of the

Club that as long as it" was directed

-by students, the organization was al-
ways 'a ﬁnancial burden to the Uni-
versity and that since the mana-
gerial responsibility. has been assum-
ed by others, this indebtedness has
ceased. WE ARE SATISFIED:

-THOSE WHO DO NOTVTVRY OUT

FOR PARTS IN THE PLAYS ARE
NOT. V . i V V

If the supposed dissatisfaction is
based upon “the out and out corrup-

‘tion involved in mulcting the student’

body as a whole, for the supportof the
organization’? what answer can be
madeto the refusal of the Student
Activity Adviser?" Committee to ac-
cept the offer of the Cap and Gown

Club when the club desired to forfeit -

the right‘ tofitsj quota of the student
activity fee at the beginning. of this
year? This; being the substance of

VVthe V so-called .“stu-dent” remonstgra-nce V
as reﬂected in the ﬁrst letter, let us

now consider the one written by
“1917.” V V   . 

It would appear fromjthe character
of this misrepresentation of “student
sentiment” that its author had been
coached by the “Student” editor « of
the neighbor in the column to the left,

as the two letters ‘agree in every par- i

ticular, especially in the employment
of groundless assertions. The burden
of ‘the “second act” seems to be a
mournful note of regret because the
author, who though unwilling to affix
his signature to a. letter that so truly
reﬂected “student sentiment”, did ‘not
receive seats to his liking. Again we
answer that by the agreement with
the Student Activity Advisory Com-

_mlttee,V_the Cap and Gown ‘Club is to

Vt‘ re

(75 cent seats). ‘In view of thigfact
We fail 130 See how this complaint can
bejustiﬁed, if the writer of the 1917
letter was disappointed it- was be-
cause he came too late, as"seVats for
students are given out in the ordeal of
‘personal application at the box oﬁice.
To complete our answer to this com-
plaint we must remind “1917” that if
he and his associates wish to be:repre-
sented to a fuller extent at future per.-
formances, they must be willing to‘

column four, of the last issue of the

‘ PITT WEEKLY. If from 11/.» to 3 for

1 is not enough, the course in Eco-
nomics is not doing someone any
great amount of good. 1

In closing this appeal for just treat-
ment at the hands of the PITT

CATION,———’we deeply regret, Dr. Mc-
Cormick, that we have ha-d to reply.

[ New Ticket Rules

We have the following suggestion
fromvanlalumnus who .sijgns hisnameh
“«Gvrad”., relative to revision of the
alumni ticket sale of football tickets.

‘Designate the most desirasble seats
as Section ‘fA”, the next best as Sec-
tion “B”‘, etc. ~ ‘

1; Allow no alumnus more than two

 

seats in Section “A”, nor more than‘

four seats in Section “B”, but allow
him as many as he wants in the other
sections. 7 ﬁe . ‘ A I
‘ 2. Allot the seats in" inverse order
of the year of graduation, i. e. give
1916 first choice, 1915 second choice,
etc. at . A
0 3. Give the alumni’ -of the College
the ﬁrst choice. Then the members
of theAlumni Association. Then alum-
ni who are not members of -the As.-
sociation. ‘ '— C
The writer believes. that this plan
will bring the ‘alumni of the various
-classes together in a way they could

not otherwise be brought together V

The_alumni_ _of the College should be"

given ﬁrst choice: 7 -

I 1. The College being the only strict-
ly and neces:sa.rily undergraduate
school, the alumni of the College will
be more interested in Pitt than the
alumni of the Professional schools
which are quasi-graduate; The hypen-

sated alumnu-s= is -always more devoted

to his college than to his professional
school. _

2. Sooner or later the Pitt team,
will b,e‘picked from College men only
and will be the College; team.

A Pharmacy Alumnus

’Dies At Uniontown

George E. Sherbon, .’08, sends us a
copy of the-Uniontown “News Stand-
-ard”, of November *19th, which con-
tains the follow'» article chronicling
the death of L. L.»"Crawfo~rd, of Union-
-town, -a. former student in _the School
of Pharmacy: ‘

“L. D. Crawford, for many years a
prominent pharmacist of this place,
died at his -home in Charles street,
Friday morning, after an extended ill-
ness‘ with Bright's disease. Mr. Craw-
ford’s death was not unexpected as he
had been very ill for months. Recent-
ly he showed.’ signs of improvement,
but it was only temporary.

“Born in Brownsville, July 1-2, 1869,
Luther‘ Linton Crawford was the son
of the late .Seaborn and Edith R. Craw-
ford, themselves among the earlier
settlers- of the river. valley. An ele-
mentary edu-cationowas gained in the
Brownsville schools, after which M_r.
.Cr.awfo-rd‘ went to the Pittsburgh Col-
lege of Pharmacy, graduating from
that institution with full honors. ’

“Returning to his nativertown, Mr.
Crawford engaged. in the drug busi-
ness with the, Robinson drug store.
Later “became to Uniontown and for
a time was associated with J.lKid Rit-
enour. More than .20 years‘ ago he
-purchased the Fuller pharmacy, the
present home of the store bearing his
name,” from Dr. John’ Fuller and.con-
ducted a business. there until a failing‘
Yliealth forced him to retire.’

“Of athletic tendencies, Mr. Craw-
ford took particular delight in his
younger days in any sport. He was re-
garded as one of the foremost -oarsmen
‘along the Monongahela river, although
hefnever took rihrt in any large
matches. One of his favorite pastimes
was bicycling and many hours he spent
with J. Denny O’Nei1, county com-
missioner of Allegheny county, rid-
ing about Fayette county. The two
were warm a.s‘soci‘ates years ago. ’

Mir. Crawford was a member of the

 

*‘Uni‘ohto.wn lodge of Elks and was a

Mason of high standing. V He also-was
_a member of the Modern. Vvoodmen of
-the World. Early in’ life he joined the
,CuI_nberland . .Presb-yterian Church of
Brownsville and never withdrew his
letters from that church after moving
to Uniontown; ‘He served two terms
in council, being elected on the Repub-
-lican ticket, of which party he was
always a staunch adherent. His last
term in 1907 was marked. by the con-
struction of the police station. He
‘was, president of the body at that
jtime. « ‘

M/r, Crawford was a member of the
three sons, his two brothers, Samuel
,of Brownsville and Attorney Charles
2S. Crawford of Pittsburgh, surviving;

“July 14,“ 1891, Mr. Crawford mar-
ried, his wife being Auberta Rush,
daughter of the late Charles» H. Rush
of Uniontown. LMrs., Crawford and two
sons and a daughter, Luther ;S. Craw-
ford, ‘Albert R. Crawford and Edith L.
Crawford,‘ survive.”

no deﬁnite action was taken. 
The :A. A.‘U. meeting included rep-

1 The Girl’s basketball team of the .

University started the season by run-

/ning up the huge score of 85 to 0

against a sextet’ of players from “Wil-

not the regular Wilson team yet the

decisive score by which the Pitt" girls

won shows that they are out to keep
up the record which they established
last.‘ year.

The game was marked by the accur-

T ate shooting of the Pitt forwards. Miss

Wehmeier ’made what is considered
a worldis record when she caged an

. even score of ﬁeld goals in the ﬁrst

half. The close guarding of the Pitt
defense prevented the. downstaters

inclined‘ to select -something of a. soft
proposition for a schedule. With the
‘exception of two or three big games

season just past is the dropping of the
Indians from the position they were
wont to occupy as the big October
attraction, and the giving of their
place to Syracuse, the big Northeast-
ern team which boiled over so much
of the’ accepted sport do-pe in the last
season. In this new foe the Blue and
Gold machine lead by theiredoub-table
All-American Peck will ﬁnd a worthy
foe. It was Syracuse, that in the last
season’s[ work, sprung so many sur-
prises on the followers of the game.
She opened ‘her season ‘by outplaying
the Princeton team when it was at

- Another big feature of the schedule
is the-._ fact that in ‘1-.916 Penn will ap-
pear in contest with the Pitt Team on
Forbes Field for the first timein the
history of Intercollegiate athletics.
‘Last autumn Pitt met the Quakers on

;_their own ﬁeld for the first game be- .

The game promises to be one ofthe
fastest and the hardest fought of the
year. The Lafayette squad are out for
,the beating thatwe inﬁicte-d on them
last year andthey still remember the
defeat that we handed to their foot-
ball eleven season before last. In-4

star footballers. V Taylor has been
elected captain of the grid team ‘for

to become accustomed to each other
they should compile a good record.
The immense crowd that turned out
‘-for-the Yale game is an evidence of
the popularity of‘ the indoor game.
Between ﬁve and six hundred people
were turned away from the game on
account of lack of space. If the

The next speaker was K. E. Davis,
graduate manager . of athletics and
general alumni secretary, who gave a.
short talk on the organization and
hlStOI‘YV0f the Jefferson County Pitt
Culb. Mr. Davis is easily the -widest
known, and most inﬂuential alumnus
who haspbeen graduated inthe last
-iive years, -and it is largely due to his
personal ‘efforts that the University
stands, so high, in the athletic world.
Mr. Davis also told of;the organiza-
tion of six other county clubs, a
movement which had its inception in
the beginning of the -local organiza-
tion just one year‘ ago last night.

F. F. Jordan, ~ the secretary, was

tivities of the Jefferson County boys
in‘ the Urﬁversity life. A reportof

Arthur Haines, manager of the

alumni and students for the courteous

lowed by Jack Thompson who gave a

pany! . a

Dr. W. A'.;Wo.mer,ithe president of

,,

as live a wire as ‘we have-met among‘
the alumni for some: time. He and
Dr. L. W. Wilson form a“ki4'i,di1ig”‘
pair that is hardto beat. The Alumni
‘Secretary intends to -get Dr. Womer
down as aspeaker at one of_the big
University banquets‘ some time in the
near future as he has entirely too
much energy bottled up-to be restrict-
edito ew Castle. - 

Dean Chambers of the School, of
Education made a big hit wi
witty yet instructive talks at ‘rNew
Castle and1Punxsutawney. The Dean’s
‘description of what. an after -dinner‘
speech should «embody brought down
the house. , And when it came to giv-
ing facts showing how the University
had advanced in recent years, Dr.
Chambers had themat his ﬁngertips.
Older graduates who rememberedthe
University under less; prosperous con-
ditions must have had-their eyes open-
ed. A special vote. of .thanks~ is due
Dean Chambers for attending, the
meeting at Punxsutawney.‘ In order
to do this, he had to break several
other engagements, get up very early
in the morning and ride about ﬁve
hours via streetcar and railroad to
the..‘it0WI1.  the? sr.ouns1h0s,-” .

Rev. P. E. Burtt ,’08, the president
of the Jefferson County -Club, is pas-
tor of the First Presbyterian Church
of'Punxsutawne‘y, Pa. Rev. Burtt was
active in religious work’ as an under-
graduate at old W. U. P. on the hill.
He has ‘made a decided impression at
Punxsutawney and is pastor of one of
the best churches in thattown. Rev.
Burtt succeeds Dr. R. C. Gourley, also
of Punxsutawney, as president of the
Club.

Dr.‘Wayne B. Smith, '15, of Punxsu-
tawney attended the Jefferson -County
Club meeting, being accompanied by
his mother. The Secretary had. the
pleasure of being entertained at the
Smith home over night.‘ Dr. Smith
has just returned from Kirksville, Mo.,
iwhere he coached or the American
School of Osteopathy eleven. ‘He had
a most successful season and 1S want-
ed back, there next fall. V

Three football ‘men attended . the
meeting at, Char1eroi——“Red” Carlson,

Dr.‘V. P. Vieslet, Med. ’10, ‘of Charle-
roi, who .-was a good pole vaulterr
when at Pitt‘, was another who at-
-tended.‘ ’ 

 Jesse B. Griﬂith, Co. ’1.5, who is at-
tending .Harvard Medical School, at‘
tended 0 at Charleroi. There were
three Herrons there——Dr. Thomas B.,
’10, of Charleroi, Dr..B. L. Herron, 315,
of Monessen, ‘and “Jim” -Herron of the
Law School. :’

Fred Jordan did his usual live wire
work in boosting. the J elferson County
affair at Punxsutawney. It was the
second annual. meeting and was Just
twice, as full of “pep”. as the original
-gathering . The ladies of the First U.
P. Church served la chicken andvwaf—
ﬁe supper to about 60 who were pres-
ent. The members of the Glee Club
were there in a body.

“Jack” Thompson of the Glee Club
scored a big hit at Punxsutawney. He
gave a reading at the Pitt Club ban-
quet before the show, too, and every-
one begged for_ “more.”_

J. W. Frank, Econ. ’16, was a good
booster for the New&C‘ast1e meetlngp

The co-eds were out in force at
New Castle. We have to give Dean
Chambers credit for -this.

ium and gymnasium——-one of the best
athletic plants in the entire United
States. ‘They have the one year resi-
dence rule in effect, making three
teams on the Pitt gridiron schedule
which has this rule. 0
The problem of reserved seat ticke
distribution to the alumni will be
carefully studied during the .time in-
tervening between now and the Fall
and a new setof restrictions adopted
governing this. Owing to the unpre-
cedented demand‘, which this ‘past Fall
was four times as heavy as the prev-
ions year, somenew restrictions will
have to be adopted to permit the sup-
ply to meet the demand and to- see
that all alumni get fairly good sleats.
Alumni interested in this are again
urged to send in their views as to just
what. these restrictions should be. One
of these restrict‘ us will likely be that
each alumnus an secure but four
tickets in preferred locations.
Although the football season is over
a month gone, the strenuous Fall
game refuses to be downed and alumni
are still talking of the great team

center helped fan, the ﬂame ‘and the
announcement of the football schedule
also lent interest. It is the general
opinion that 1916 will be the “great-
est” ever for Pitt footbal-lo and with
‘Glenn Warner again at the helm, the
record‘ will be made should not be
second to that of 1915.
