Fall Enrollment Shoivs

Probable Decrease

You may be able to find a seat in the Tuck Shop this sem-
ester. Available figures indicate that enrollment this year is on

the downward path.
But J. G. Quick, registrar,

warns against a premature pre-

diction. He points out that as yet it is difficult to accurately

estimate the number of students re-
gistering today, tomorrow, and Mon-
day through Wednesday of next
week.

Camparing the number of accepted
freshmen applicants on September-v
9 of this fall with those of Septem-
ber 9, 1949, Mr. Quick finds a 12.4
per cent decrease.

Drop Explained
The decrease in registration fi-
gures may involve several factors:

Used Books
Sold Here

 The University has entered the
used book field.

According to Mrs. Geraldine Mc-
Cord, manager of the ground-floor
University Bookstore, 3000 used
textbooks will be on sale thereto
students this semester.

The stock of used books covers
the majority of subjects taught at
the University, Mrs. McCord says.
Those courses which will be using
new textbooks this semester are, of
1 not covered by the used
book stock, she added.

.In addition, students who wish
9 ') sell their textbooks may do so
at the bookstore. At present a stu-
‘dent will not rrceive cash for his
books, but will .nstead get a receipt
which may b turned’ in later for

"The bookstore has adopted the
policy of handling second-hand
books, as well as new ones says
the (store manager, because of
numerous requests by the student
body for this service.
Mrs. McCord does not believethat
this entry into the sale of used
books will conflict with the Men’s
Council bookstore, which handles
only used books.
The Men’s Council store, located
on the 8th floor, will be in operation
from next Monday to October 7‘,

according to Ronald Ecker, manager.

QODOM Undergoes

Personnel hges

Edwin J. McIntosh, assistant to
the dean of men for the past four
years, has resigned to accept a
post with the Lawrenceville branch
of the YMCA.

Mr. McIntosh, active in YMCA
work for a number of years and a
former president of the University
branch, ‘is to be Branch Executive
in Lawrenceville.

During his four-year tenure as an
assistant dean here, he was first

advisor to fraternities and later
director of freshman affairs and
orientation.

A successor to Mr. McIntosh has
not yet been appointed, according
to Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men.

The assistant dean's departure
means one more change in an office
already very much different from last
year’s. ‘

The duties of Richard P. Cass-
iiano, who resigned last spring, have
been partially transferred to Lester
G. Brailey, who in addition to being
advisor to men’s fraternities, will

also supervise the 10-od_d scholar-
ships under the jurisdiction of the

dean of men.Cassiano’s other duties
will be taken over by the athletic
department. J ,

MCINTYRE ‘ FOSTER

Mr. McIntyre graduated from the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Education with highest honor in
1939. He has taught at the Univer-
sity of Miami and in the Coraopolis
public schools.

Mr. Foster received his bachelor
of'arts degree here in 1948 and has
been doing graduate work in politi-
cal science working with the In-
stitute of Local Government in‘ the

  
   

University. , -

1) There will be a decrease in
veteran’s enrollment.

2) The depression caused a de-
crease in the birthrate of children
who should now be ready for col-
lege.

3) The Korean situation could,
have a slight effect on enrollment.

The registrar’s office has sent
out approximately 16,000 pre-
registration kits and 3000 permits
to register. Last fall’s figures, ac-
cording to a report in the News,
were estimated at 17,377 registra-
tion kits and 4000 permits.

In the past three years, according
to Mr. William Saalbach, assistant
dean of men, veterans have made
up about half the student body.
This term he says he expects that
figure to drop to one-third or two
fifths of the number of students.

Less Vets Expected

Mr. Saalbach says the University
is expecting from 9000 to 9500 vete-
rans in all its graduate, under-
graduate, and extension divisions.
About 7000 of these will be under
the G I Bill of Rights.

A ngticeable change in registra-
tion this year is the switch from the
basement of the Syria Mosque,
which is being redecorated, to the
Foster Memorial Recreation Hall,
the women's gym in the Cathedral,
and the basement cafeteria.

Mr. Quick commented, “At the
,present time the Mosque is being
enlarged and it is doubtful that re-
gistration could have been held
there this fall even though we had
not made the present arrange-
merits.”

for the nursing staff of Western

The actual cost of the building
has been set at $3,657,000. An
estimate of additional expenses
brings the total to $4,175,000.

Located on Lothrop Street be-
tween Fifth Avenue and Victoria

Home will house 650 student nurses.
Although original plans called for

library.

Construction Overdue

Construction of the new Nurses
Home is long overdue, according to

Graduate House,
New Dorm, Open

Graduate House, the University’s
new dormitory, is ready to receive
the 75 graduate students who are to
call it "home” for this academic
year.

Located at 211 S.Dithridge Street,
the orange brick building is the
second dormitory to be purchased
by the University and the first to
be used exclusively by graduate
students.

Formerly an apartment building,
Graduate House contains 36 rooms,
most of which will be occupied by
two men. There are a few larger
three-man rooms and some suites
for four. T)n each of the four floors
is a large washroom.

According to ]. Edward Ricart,
director of men’s housing, the open-
ing of the new dormitory stillgdoes
not take care of the demand for
housing. The only other University
dormitory is DeSoto Hall which
houses 52 men students. Women
students living at the school reside
in sorority houses.

and; with a view’~toward insuring that
business’ continued prosperity. The
conviction hereabouts seems to be
that there are simply no‘t‘enough
honorary keys, pins, and bther do-
hickeys being worn on campus_.

This conviction, it should be
explained, has been formed by a
select circle of campus muftis,
most of whom are already lugging
so many keys around that they look
like they are majoring for a career
in janitorial service. Their demand
for further 14-carat gadgets stems
not from bragadocciag, they will
have you know. Perhaps,with fierce
autumn winds coming on, the boys
are merely planning adequate bodily
coverage. .

The first indication of the trend
toward gold-plated fashions arose

meeting was to find ways and means
of .saving those students who don't
take part in extracurricular activities
from aicultural degeneration. Pick-
ing away at greasy spring chicken,
the campus Babbits decided on a
constgictive program, the ninth
point of which was to “provide
recognition for holders of worthy
and responsible positions, such _as
fraternity presidents” (who in-
cidentally are shy, singularly un-
known and unsung individuals).

“What do you mean byffurther
recognition’,” Ewart was later
asked by a silly fellow who had
read over the New Pfogfam‘

"Well, now, maybe some symbol
of some sort.”

“Like what?”

"Well, now, maybe like ODK P1115,
or something.”

You see. Mere educational or
recreational benefits are skimpy
motives for a man joining an extra-
curricular activity. What our activity
groups need are more men possess-
ing intense ambitions to accumulate
keys and pins in large quantities.

The measure of a college man’s
success is the tonnage on his key
chain. Just ask Don Ewart, or better
yet, ask John M. Roberts.

 Ends Vindicated  by Timmonsl

Terminal Coach Deniesg.

‘Weak Link’ Charge

By WILL DOERGE

MEADVILLE, Pa.—It has been generally agreed that this
year’s Pitt football team is strong in the line and weak in the
backfield. And in the same breath it is also mentioned that the ~
end positions may be a weak link in the line. - =

This week, though, at the Panthers’ grid camp in Meadville
Bob Timmons, veteran Panther end coach, vindicated his ends. it

"There’s no worry here,” he said. "We’re as strong at end

       
  
   
 
 

as at any other position in the
line.” .

He points out that the Panthers
have two top lettermen ready for

services of Harry Hollihan, who {
came up with a badly twisted knee‘
in last Saturday's rough and tumble
scrimmage.
Camp to Break

Three other sophomores are vie-
ing for berths on the Panther squad—,
George Glagola, Joe Kova1_, and
Andy Lelik. The latter is the best

DISCARDS from

By WILL DOERGE

MEADVILLTZ, Pa.——Rep0rts out of the South have Duke the South-
eastern Conference winner this fall. This is hardly the news to cheer
Len Casanova and his team as they prepare for the Duke opener on
September 30.

The Blue Devils have an advant-
age in that they will have a game
under their belts by the time they
meet the Panthers. They play South
Carolina on September 23.

The last-stepping junior from
Evans City ran circles around the
intra-squad games. It was quite a
surprise to observers, for it was
the first time that Fyock had
blossomed into the limelight.

and even mercenary to speak of

R fthe effect a war has on one’s pocketbook. But the'fact remains
that the possibility of a third world. war has cast afat financial

  cloud over the men who bank Pitt's "0

~' _ football gate receipts.

They have got to make a killing
this year while the killing is good.

' -T For all anyone knows, there may not

V the‘-Stadium is here to stay and it

takes a lot of shekels to maintain it.
Retiring Stadium bonds with no

’  income is a neat trick if you can do
it. You won't learn how in Bus Ad.

 

Pressure Is On

Anyhow, the pressure is on to
-make this season an outstanding
financial success—another job that

  is not going to be easy. Not if last
a - year’s' disappointing income means

 

 

 

  

._ as

anything. .

I just how much was cleared is not
a matter of public knowledge, but
is known that the amount was
-considerably less than Pitt officials
had hoped for. There were several
reasons for the letdown, chief of
which probably were the ticket

prices and the coal strike.

When Athletic Director Tom Ham-
ilton took over he figured Pitt should
‘be charging the same ante for end
zone seats as for sideline seats,
which is the scheme at many colleges
throughout the nation. So he revised

 theprices toward that end.

I,

V The results were a lot of beef-

' ing from the customers and a lot of

staying away by same. 
Western Pennsylvania fans like
their football but there are lots of

‘ -~ other places for them to get it when

_ ‘Pitt's prices don't suit them. High

school ball goes over big in these
parts, and pro football takes in its
share of dollars, too.

Bargains Again

Consequentially, Hamilton has
had to return to the old pricing
system with a bargain department
behind each goalpost. He’s hoping
those who left the Pitt camp will
come back, and also registering an
odd prayer here and there that John
L. hasn’t a strike in mind for this
fall.

Perhaps Captain Tom could
breathe easier if the Stadium seated
only 35,000 instead of twice that
number. Graduate Manager Frank
Carver, who has been around here a
long time, once remarked:

"The Stadium seats twice the
amount of our average crowd, so
we are actually paying a lot of
unnecessary maintenance costs.”

Well, Mr. Carver ain’t seen nothing

yet. Next year the average crowd
may be 000,000. Think of all the
unnecessary maintenance costs
then.
