Meeting Features

Address by Dean

Alumni of the School of Applied
Social Science at the University
met for an all-day conference
Saturday at Stephen Foster me-
morial, which featured an address

-on “Where We are in Profession-

al Edu-cation” by Dr. Wilber I.
Newstetter, dean of the School of
Applied Social Sciences.- He was
followed on the. program by Mrs.
Cecelia Moss, educational con-
sultant, American Re-d Cross, Mrs.
Florence Ray, supervisor, Bra-
shear settlement, and Mr. Paul
Simon, director, Soho Community
house who discuss-ed develop-
ments in social work an-d training
for it.

In the afternoon a number of

discussions were held. The day

closed with a dinner in the Hotel

  

Construction

‘of the plans will not begin until

peace—time. Money collected now

will be invested in war bonds.
Girls are urged to turn in money

as they receive it. Pitt women are

also asked to wear their white
tags or their red ones if they have
earned them.

$100,000 is needed to complete
and furnish the twelfth floor
which will be used as a meeting
place for the many women stu-
dents of the University. A kitchen,
conference room, roof deck, and
social room are only a few of fea-
tures of the layout plans. A draw’-
ing room memorial in tribute to
the late Thyrsa W. Aamos, former
dean of women, will also be con-
structed. _

Two years ago when the army
program began at Pitt, it was nec-
essary for women students to give
up the twelfth floor as their place
of activities. Now, it is possible
and expected that this floor will
be used more a.nd more as the
semester progresses. A

In addition to the YWCA office
on the twelfth ﬂoor, there__is also
one other room which is fully
completed. It is the Braun Con-
ference room. When the army
moved in, the furniture was cov-
ered, and the doors were locked;
however, the room can now be put
in use as soon as there is need
for it.

Women’s Health Service
Moves To 16th Floor

Student health service for
women, headed by Dr. Auleene M.
Jamison, has moved ‘temporarily
to the 16th ﬂoor, Room.l6l7, where
the military infirmary was pre-
viously located. Upon completion
of the tw‘enty—eighth ﬂoor, the
health service will return to its
former offices.

The change in location does not
mean a change in the services
given by Dr. Jamison and her staff
of nurses. Examinations, emer-
gency treatment, and use of sleep-
ing rooms will continue to be
available. There is also -elevator
service to the. 16th . ﬂoor.

Student Fund Drive
Aids War—Stricl{en

“Hitch your wagon to a star; $999.99 and there you are.”
that as the theme and “Give the buck, don’t pass it” the slogan, the
War Student Service Fund committee expects to go over the top this,
week in their drive to collect funds to aid war stricken students in
China, American prisoners of war, evacuees, and war refugees through-

out the world.

Ed Citron, C, and Ruth Miller, E, co-Chairmen of the drive, plan

    
    

 
 

With

        
      
    
  

to have Homer Loh, general sec-

retary of the Chinese Student
Christian association, speak to
campaign workers this afternoon.
In order that students may be con-
tacted for contributions, the WSSF
committee plan a luncheon to be
held in the mess hall tomorrow at
12:30 o’clock. Contributions will be
made either by pledges, payable
in the YMCA or YWCA offices, or
by paying directly. '
Accomplishments of the WSSF
were cited by chairman Ed Citron.
In China food, daily necessities,
travel aid,.work relief, and med-
ical service were provided, along
with opportunity for education. In
many instance, he pointed out,
students were forced to leave their
schools during Japanese invasion
and conduct classes in caves. He
also told of the aid American
prisoners of war have been re-
ceiving. The WSSF in several
cases arranged for these students
to receive their degrees from Ox-
ford university. American prison-
ers of war in ‘Germany are to re-
ceive recordings of American ra-
dio broadcasts along with receiv-
ing educational and religious ma-
terials. In 1940 approximately 30,-
000 prisoners have been allowed
to continue their education in
prison camps. “Not only are the
American prisoners helped but
the students of our allies as well.
The Russian students are also dis-
possessed. Today the conquered
students of 1855 institutions are
moving back to their old univer-
sity in the west. They too will
need books and other things to
restore them back to university

So you’re the hard-headed type, hmm°.?' You don’t give a
‘darn—let alone money, you know, that precious green stuff, for

the starving Armenians, or the Greeks, or Russians, or Poles.-

The heck with international good will and cooperation. You’re
going to retire right back into that little cave just south of Kis-
kiminctas after the war and let the whole blasted world go to
pot.

Okay, just you go right ahead and be practical. Leave the
peace-plans in poli sci class, and DON’T give to the World Stu-
dent Service fund. It’s not your concern anyhow; they’re noth-
ing but “furriners.” .

But brother, .haven’t you heard? There are about 100,000
prisoners of war in the Far East and a good portion of these
are Americans. Those are our boys, American lads, your broth-
ers, cousins, fathers, the sweetheart of the little blonde across
the street, the son of your next door neighbor. It’s for them
that you’re asked to give good American dollars, dollars that
will provide books, and paper, and pencils, and FOOD.

It’s for these lads, your friends, the guys from whom you

I used to borrow math home-work, and mooch cigarettes, that

the money is needed. If these boys are to escape “barbed wire
disease,” the fatal stuﬁ that saps a fellow’s initiative, makes him
listless and dead ‘to his world, they must have books and maga-
zines and things to THINK about.

Imagine it: what if you were penned up behind stark wire
with nothing better to look at than your fellow prisoners, and

"nothing to think about save the steaks and chocolate sundaes

that used to be. No hopes, no dreams, no aspirations: that’s
what it ’s like. You ’d go quietly nuts too.

I So for them, the guys you used toiknow, the quarterback on
the high-school football team and the lad that carried the water
pail too, for their sake, give and give generously. “Give that

buck, don’t"pass it!” ,

This is the third in a series of articles presenting student opinion

on universal military conscription. It does not necessarily coincide

with the opinions of the editors of the News.

I am against universal military training for the American
youth, not because it is un-American, for anything the PEOPLE
wish to do is American, not because it breeds a military caste

A with reactionary tendencies, for as long as We have popular gov-

ernment we need not fear any caste or group, whether reac-

tionary or radical.
I am against universal military training because it takes

from the youth his freedom of individual expression. It makes
of him a machine, submissive and without responsibilities. At an
age when he should learn to adjust himself to life’s problems,
his entire life is being mapped out for him by old men in Wash-
ington, who cramp him within the narrow limits of army doc-
trine.

. I am against universal military training because it breeds
wars. It is an old political truth that whenever a country main-
tains a large army, whenever part of a country’s industry is
geared toithe production of the materiel of war, war itself is
just around the corner.

_I am against universal military training because it is a
cynical repudiation of everything the leaders of our nation have
worked for. It is a repudiation of the Atlantic Charter; it is
the horselaugh for Dumbarton Oaks and Yalta. It is a lack of
faith in democracy. Let us rally the forces of democracy in this

.world. Let us do away with every single soldier and every sin-

gle machine gun once victory has been achieved. Let us stop

B thinking in terms of war. Let us, instead, work for peace.

A There’s a fraternity gang. They.

say “hya, keed,” and go back
into the huddle. The “keed’.’ is
feeling lonely. But what can, he
do?

’I‘h.at’s the story a lot of fel-

lows and girls have told me. -I can»

certainly see their point of view,

No, it doesn’t! Every college has
it to a greater or lesser degree.
Everywhere you’ll go, you’ll ﬁnd
cliques—in the business world as

Dear Morale Builders,

I am always happy to receive
the interesting “News Letters” and
papers. I have been overseas now
for two years and sixmonths, and
I can truthfully say that the let-
ters from Pitt with the news have
been a great factor in keeping me
cheerful and with peace of mind.
I am askin-g you to accept my
thanks for the lift. I am very lucky
to run across so many sons of
Pitt and tell them about the news
letters I get.

I was in Hawaii for almost two
years ‘and now I‘ -am somewhere
in the Philippines.

The Pitt Panthers are doing a
great job -but that is just one of
the habits of Pitt sons. ‘

I hope to be back in school.

soon to ﬁnish my graduate -work.
Yours, one of the sons, '

. of Learning? -

2. How the money was raised

/to build the rooms?

3. If the rooms are still connect-
ed in any way with the various

‘ nations?

Just how mu-ch do you know
about the rooms which distinguish
Pitt from all other universities
and colleges?

' Noblemen, statesmen, high mili-
tary ofﬁcers, artists, and great
teachers have visited Pitt class-
rooms. They have all been inter-

ested in the idea that classrooms
should not be merely rooms with
numbers on the doors, but “The
Italian Room” or “The Swedish
Room”, rooms with distinct per-
sonalities of their own.

But what about you, the Pitt
students? Have you any more
knowledge of the classrooms now
than the day you ﬁrst walked into
them, and do you tell others about
them? There are countless per-
sons in Pittsburgh who have
neither visited the classrooms nor
heard anything about them. The
students could do much to increase
interest and pride in these rooms.

A group of nationality class-
room hostesses, whose job it is to
explain the rooms to visitors, has
formed a new campus organiza-
tion. The club, Quo Vadis, has the
express purpose of broadening

‘ both its own ' and the public’s

knowledge of the classrooms. To
be tapped to Quo Vadis, a girl
must have completed 27 hours of
hostess duty. But each of the
charter members has devoted
many more than the required
number of hours, going on duty at
least one hour a week and serv-
ing at receptions and conventions.

The organization will tap new
members’ at the regular tap day
ceremonies in the spring. Doro-
thea Strawn, Ed, president, said,
“We’re going to have good times.
We enjoy the nationality work
very much, and we’re going. to try
to share our satisfaction with as
many people as we can.”

So, students, let’s all get behind
Pitt’s baby activity, Quo Vadis,
and do all we can, as individuals,
to » know and teach others about
our nationality classrooms.

“Pitt Coeds Immature”

Say Discharged Vets

college life in general and about
Pitt in particular? With constant-
ly increasing numbers of veterans
returning to the campus, many of
us have been wondering about
their various reactions, thoughts,

, likes, and dislikes.

Here at Pitt, most of the vets”
have merged. themselves into the
college s-cene with-out much diﬁi—
culty. Therefore, any cross-section
of their opinions is bound to show
some variance of views. However
on some questions, they are al-
most unanimous in their opinions.

Most of the vets are strongly
in favor of more social activities.
Illustrative of this point of View
is J o-e Stepek, E, who says, “There
should be more social life; there
‘aren’t enough dances.” Then he
adds a word of praise by saying,
“I like the way the Tu-ck Shops
an-d mess hall are being run by
Miss Ruth Cramblet.”

Most o-f the ex-servicemen seem
to like the way they have been
treated and have no particular
fault to find with anything. Joe
Lang, BA, s-ays, “I think Dean
Biddle and Mr. Arthur have co-
operated splendidly with us and
are only too glad to help us at
all times.” Dave R-eisberg, C, adds,
“I enjoy taking part in activities,
and I am glad to see them gradu-
ally returning to a pre-wuar basis.”

' However, the vets are not in
the least’ averse to offering criti-
cism where they think it is need-
ed. George Po-limus, BA, com-
ments, “On the whole, school is
OK, but some students an-d in-
structors are exceptions to this.”
A former member of the women’s
marine corps reserve, tall, viva-
cious Pat Maccleary, Ed, says,
“Making friends is hard, espe-
cially in the Tuck Shops. The at-
mosphere is too “cliquish.” Lucy
Sproat, N, former army nurse and
ﬁrst woman veteran to enroll her-e
at the University suggests, “There
should be dormitories at Pitt, and
there are also not enough social
functions.”

Many of the veterans attended

Gunther Graduated

Margaret Anne Gunther, seaman
first class, of 1427 Denniston ave-
nue, was graduated recently from
the Naval Training school, Iowa
State Teachers’ college, Cedar
Falls, Iowa. Seaman Gunther was
graduated from Pitt’s School of
Education in 1943‘ and entered the
service in October, 1944. She is
the daughter of Mrs. Margaret
Gunther, who is employed in the

What do veterans think aIb0ut¢

Pitt before the war and have now
returned to complete their courses.
Naturally, they miss their old
friends, who are no longer here
and their attitude is reﬂected by
Dick Briney, C, who says, “School
isn’t quite the same without the
old gang,” and then adds, with a

grin, “But things seem to be pick- ‘

ing up.”

Disapproval is expressed by
many veterans, who prefer to re-
main anonymous, in regard to
some people’s inability t-o recog-
nize discharge buttons. A-ccor-ding
to many of the vets, they have
been taken for everything from
Nation-al Honorary Society pins to
bowling medals. On the subject of
coeds, most of the veterans agree
that they haven’t lost any of their
old appeal. Nevertheless, there are
a fewvdissenters, who also prefer
to remain under the cloak of an-
onymity. They think that most of
the current crop of coeds are a
little too immature and a triﬂe
too concerned ‘over trivial things.
They ﬁnd it hard to get excited
over house parties and May Day
parades, after what some of them
have been through.

To sum up, most of the vets
have found a place for themselves
here at school an-d are getting
along pretty smoothly. "Although
their main interest in being here
is to complete their educations,
they still enjoy having a part in
the social life of the University,
and nothing pleases them more
than being ‘able to feel that they
really “belong.” .

McDowell, ‘

By Margie Long and Arnie Steinman

Now women’s rush is over,
Their airs are put aside,

The men frats now are grooming,

. Their claws for rushees’ hides.

’The stage is set for business,

Each house is spic and span,
They’re out to sock all rushees,
Or leastways get one man.

On Saturday evening the Delts
had a house full of rushees wait.-

ing anxiously for the Pot-o-Gold

drawing. The lucky winner of the
“Pot” was presented a twenty-
ﬁve dollar War bond.

' The Phi Delts had a dinner
dance for their Saturday night
program. The brothers and
rushees with their dates had din-
ner and then spent the evening
dancing.

After spending Thursday night
enjoying the comments of “Doc”
Carlson, Pat Comisky, and Bill
Benswanger, the Phi Eps topped
off rush week with a dance fea-
turing Joey Simms and his or-
chestra. -

Just to be different, or for some

other reason, the Phi Gams pledg-

ed five new upperclassmen before
rush week. The new pledges are
Bill Clark, John Anthony, Gene
Johannesmeyer, Elmer Fritz, and
Bob Hayhurst. ,

The Phi Kaps expected Gene
Kelly to arrive ‘in Pittsburgh on
Saturday night in time to attend
their combined rush dance with
the Phi Gams. The Hollywood star

.was a Phi Kap at Pitt during the

thirties.

On Thursday evening the PiKAs
held sports night at their house.
Guests included Harry Keck,
Chilly Doyle, Pie! Traynor, and
several Pittsburgh Hornet hockey
players. The playeirs presented the
fraternity with two autographed
hockey sticks

The Pi Lams spent Thursday
night at the .Warner club where
they saw a. sneak preview of the

a current sensation, “A Tree Grows

in Brooklyn.” .

Comic sound movies were the
feature attraction at the SAE
house on Thursday night. After
the movie the boys enjoyed a
tasty snack.

The novelty of rush week for
the Sigma Chis was a huge cake
baked in the shape of a Sigma
Chi pin. The cake looked so good
that the boys hated to eat it.

The Chi 0’s are planning to open
house sometime in the near fu-
ture. Watch this column for the
all important “when?”

All of the Phi Sigs lent their
support to their alumnae-spons:or-
ed dinner at the Hotel Webster
Hall last Sunday. The proceeds

from the affair were contributed

to the Red Cross.

Founder’s Day for Phi Mu was
March 4, but the fraternity cele-
brated last Saturday with a pledge
banquet and Founder’s Day serv-
ice.»

The Kappas will hold formal
initiation March 9 and 10 for Mary
Ellen Lambing, Ruth Anne Chil-
c-ote, Mary Lou Stickle, and Ruth
Alford. March 12 is‘ the date for
the beginning -of a series of tea
dances. The ﬁrst one will be in

‘honor of the Delts.

‘Three The-ta members are again
back at Pitt. They are Linda Lee
Price, Dottie Kline, and Nellie
Lauth. ‘Two Penn State Thetas vis-
ited Pitt last week and were en-
tertained at the Theta house.

Pledges of TPA will be enter-
tained by their active sisters at
a dinner at the Fairfax tonight. At
a recent election, Mary Lou Guid-
ish was elected social chairman for
pledges and Gloria Harold, junior
Panhellenic representative. The
TPAS are having a tea dance for
the Phi Gams on Friday.

The Tri Delts pledge banquet
was held at the Fairfax February
27. Last Friday they had a bridge
and tea at, the house in honor of
the pledges.

The Beta Sigs have planned a
tea. for the parents of all pledges
and active members March 11.
Before pledging, February 27, the
fraternity held a banquet at which
each pledge received a rose.

Pitt and ‘Tech chapters of Alpha
Epsilon Phi were recently the
guests. of Pitt’s dental fraternity,
Alpha Omega, at a ‘tea dance at
their house on Forbes street.

Delta Zetas will give a tea
dance at their house for the Sig-
ma Chis March 9. New DZ pledge
ofﬁcers are: Beth Sterner, presi-
dent; Margie Heinlein, vice presi-
dent; Delores Stumpff, secretary-
treasurer; and Ruth Barton, Pan-
Hellenic representative.

Now that all the big booming
fraternities have latched on to
their respective freshman king-
pins, we can settle down and give
you the news “as you like it.”

Publicity stunts this rush week
included Tasia Karageorge and
Romaine Taddio who were chosen
Blue and Green Lions of SAE.
The Delts climaxed their Saturday
night dance with a drawing for a
-war bond and a performance by
Dick Hazley whose hypnotic act
-resulted in ten people, including
Dr. Ferguson, going to sleep. (And
to think we forgot our blankets!)

Chuck (Elsa Maxwell) Berg has
joined George Polimus among the
ranks of party-givers. This week-
end made his second. One of the
events was the christening of Rep-
pert and Sarles with a keg of
beer.

things certain with frat pins. Bob
Nagel and Betty Ellen Whitten,

It’s Betty Jane Wright and Allan

These pinnings keep piling up.
Here’s still another. Gloria Har-
ald and Jack Branigan, a Theta

off that Betty Gibson is now using
a new secret-formula hair rinse.
She’s keeping it quiet, though,-—

By Jim Pettican

(Ed. Note: Petrillo’s side of this
question was presented by the mu-
sic editor, Arnold Steinman. sev-
eral weeks ago. Jim Pettican was
asked to writeaan article present-
ing the opposite point of view).

James C. Petrillo, president of
the’ American Federation of Mu-

1 sicians (A. F. of L.) is a man ac-

customed to having his own way.
Through the years, this trait has
enabled him to build up the rather
formidable organization which he
heads today. Back in the days,
when “Little Caesar” took over the
helm, the plight of the professional
musician was not a happy one.
Talented musicians were being
paid as little as three or four dol-
lars a night, and there was a pre-
ponderance of non-union musi-
cians who were underselling and
cheapening the entire profession.

Since that time, under the guid-
ance of Mr. Petrillo, a great change
has taken place. New, professional
music-makers are well paid and
are taken care of under strictly
stipulated rules and agreements.
This is all on the good side of the
ledger, and it might also be men-
tioned that Mr. Petrillo’s appre-
ciative followers have not per-
mitted him to starve either as his
lush offices, substantial income,
bodyguards, and custom—built
limousine will testify. Yes, the
boys have been good to “Little

Caesar,” and he has become a czar
of the music industry.

However, in the past few years,
Mr. Petrillo who never was noted
for his tact has become downright
deﬁant and domineering. He
stands, today, as a yet undefeated
champion. In his recent bout with
the major record companies, he
emerged unscathed after riding
roughshod over the dictates of both
the War Labor Board and Mr.
Roosevelt himself. (And he wasn’t
carried out of his office either!)
This was accomplished by the sim-
ple ruse, that Mr. Petrillo’s busi-
ness does not enter into, or in any
way, hinder the prosecution of the
war.

After licking his chops over this
juicy triumph, the music monarch
soon set out in search of new
worlds to conquer. Now as every-
one knows—-until recently-—it was
always the practice of various
civic-minded radio stations
throughout the country to present
programs by school musical groups
made up of talented school chil-
dren. Mr. Petrillo, however,
doesn’t like this. To him, non-
union members are still non-union
members whether they be six or
sixty. As a result, school music
groups are now banned from the
air throughout the country.

Then, recently, as a climax to
his “joust with the juveniles,” Mr.
Petrillo has removed all union

according to “Little Caesar,” that
the president of the organization,
Dr. Joseph E. Maddy, has been go-
ing around the country making
statements detrimental to Mr.
Petrillo’s own personal constitu-
tion. _ '
According to recent news from
Washington, Senator Arthur H.
Vandenburg (R. Mich.) has ac-
cused the eminent music czar of
“engaging in battle with the school
children of America.” To support
his contention, Mr. Vandenburg
has introduced a bill which would
make it illegal for anyone to inter-
fere with the broadcast of non-
commercial cultural programs.
The bill, passed by the Senate, is
now before the House. Reports of
its progress are eagerly awaited.
This bill may prove to be Mr.
Petrillo’s “Ides of March.” As any
American will tell you, we don’t
like, being pushed around by an
abuse of personal power.

iiPitt’s Chances Rated As Good’

To Receive llffer in District  

By LARRY BONDY
“Go \Vest Young Man, Go West” is quite a popular saying,
but at present the basketball team prefers going East. Approx-
imately 450 miles east of Pitttsbiirgh is a metropolis called New

.York and located there is Madison Square Garden where the
N. C. A. A. tournaments are held.

With. Temple and Penn out

of the District 2 picture because of the loss of star players and
sound trouncings, Pitt is ready to sneak in the back-door.

The Panthers were being seri-9

ously considered to compete in
the tournaments when West Vir-
ginia nosed them out at home and
it looked as if the cover was clos-
ed oa another basketball edition
at Pittsburgh. Now everything
looks a little brighter in Smoky
City for the Carlson quintet, due
to the elimination of other district
leaders.

In looking for a tournament
contender a win and loss c0lum.n
isn’t the whole story. If an outﬁt
played small colleges having sec-
ond-rate teams and won them all,
that is no criterion that it is a
contender for the national honor;
but by playing teams with Navy
trainees that rate high in the
country, and ending with a medi-

, _ ocre record it has more of a
 chance. Loss of personnel after the
regular season and the reputation

of the team hold considerable
weight. .

Analyzing the various colleges
considered, we rate Pitt high.
They have a reputation in the
country to be well proud of.

Names such as Hank Zeller, Nate

all had previous experience, are
found in the line-up. Pitt’s 8 and

of. Westminster beat an unor-
ganized Pitt squad early in the
season, and three weeks later the
Phantoms won at the stadium by
19 points. Pitt also split with
Penn, State and West Virginia,
winning on the home court and
suffering losses away. Army is the

tain Men defeated Carnegie Tech

Once again the ‘Pitt ROTC Riﬂe
team has emerged victorious in its
recent tilts against Georgia Tech
and Texas A&M bringing their
record to a total of 11 wins against
3 defeats.-

The ﬁnal and total score for this
shooting match was 1835 (3 points
higher than their all time high of
1832 last week). The Pittites de-
feated both teams decisively, beat-
ing Georgia Tech by 162 points
and besting ‘Texas A&M by 73
points.

As to the Third Service com-
mand shooting matches, the Pitt
men, comprising a 10—man team,
fired a total of 3653 points out of
a possible 4000 perfect score. But
thus far no ﬁnal tabulations from
the other competing schools have
been learned and probably will not
be for the remainder of this week.

According to Sergeant Dough-
erty, who is in charge of the Pitt
Riﬂe team, “Pitt has a very good
chance of placing high in the re-
cent matches and may possibly
have a chance to ﬁre in the Na-
tional Service matches comprising
the winning teams from all the

Service command areas.”

Besides the Service matches, the
Riﬂe team ﬁred against North Da-
kota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and
Mississippi but the results will not
be known for some time to come.

Without a doubt the Third Serv-
ice command match is the most
important of any match the Pitt
Riﬂes have ﬁred in, and a place in
this match will make them one of

Those were the days! Basketball was a man’s game, and

Downs, the immortals, the pioneers, the ﬁrst real greats of the
old pro-basketball games. ,

Honey Russell was a triﬂe nervous. It was his ﬁrst profes-
sional basketball game and he had to jump center against the
fabulous Horse Haggerty. But Haggerty instantly made him
feel at ease for a moment anyway. The Horse met him at mid
floor, a beaming smile on his face as he stretched forth a “hand”
in friendly greeting.

the dribblers had a few tricks of

equipped with a radiator or stove,
they’d lure an unsuspecting vic-
tim in the immediate vicinity of
the heating apparatus and clamp
him tightly against it.

Snooks Downs had his own fav-
orite. His mother was a constant
spectator at all his home games,
parked decorously in the third
row. So, Snooks always looked
for an opportunity to maneuver his
opponent into the proper spot and
then hoist him into the second row
in front of Momma. “Well do I

she jabbed me with the weapon.”

 Freshman Club Turns

 

In Sparkling Triumph

By Lowell Lubic

During the lull caused by rush-
ing, the “Y” Freshman Club en-
gaged the Phi Eps in a practice
basketball game. Sporting one of
the most formidable aggregations
seen in many a time, the “Y”
easily trounced the Phi Eps 59 to
39. It may have been the fact
that the “Y” had excess substitu-
tions, but more likely the one-
sided victory was caused by the
more experience “Y” ballplayers

who have come to Pitt with ter-

riﬁc basketball reputations. These
players worked so smoothly, that
the Phi Eps were never in the
game. The only threat that the
Phi Eps made was late in the third
quarter when they had narrowed
the score to 34-40. This brief Phi
Ep spree was due
Blumenfeld who hit the basket for
ten. quick points, For the “Y,”
Zola Gold, Howard Beck, Murray
Zeilinger, Joe Pollock, and Mort
Lerner lead the attack. Zola Gold
especially impressed the crowd on
hand with his team playing. He
continuously used successfully
several “screen” plays which he
learned while playing basketball
for Allderdice High. ‘

Teaming up with Gold were Pol-
lock and Beck. Both these boys
were on the scoring end of the
“screen” plays. Most of the scor-
ing came from Pollock’s overhand
tosses and Beck’s beautifully
timed pitches.

With Payton scoring ﬁfty—one

Lams 95 to 41. The game was“
one-sided throughout, with Payton
scoring continuously. Each time
he received the ball it went swish— ‘
ing through. the hoop. The Pi
Lams were out of the game from
the beginning and never were able

to bounce back. Leading by 20
points throughout the contest, the 
SAEs worked skillfully without ~
any signs of fatigue. They han-
dled the ball expertly as they conl ,
tinued to set, up their plays to ’
perfection. Substitutions were V
used frequently by the SAEs, but A '
to no avail, since they were not
able to keep the score down. This
victory awakens the other frater-
nities to the fact that the SAEs
will furnish some tough competi-
tion for the basketball crown.

Commainider John P. Bracken,
U-SNR, a graduate of the Univer-
sity in 1934, has been awarded

the Legion of Merit by the Pres-
dent of the United States for
meritorious service in defense of
the ‘Dutch East Indies during the
period from July, 1942 to May,
1943. He was also awarded the
Order of Orange Nassau by Queen
Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.

The citation that accompanied
the Legion of Merit said, in part,
that the award "was made for
“exceptionally meritorious con-
duct in the performance of out-
standing service to the govern-
ment of the United States while
attached to the staff of the Com-
mander of All Forces, Aruba-
Curacao, during the period of July
9, 1942 to ‘May 6, 1943. The Dutch
award was made “for protection
of the Dutch East Indies and the
Dutch West Indies.” Commander
Bracken was further honored by
being ma-de a Knight of the Order
of Orange Nassau.

The action for which he was
decorated took place while
Bracken was signal officer and
ship secretary on the light cruiser
which, though disabled, made
home port after a victorious en-
gagement with the Japanese. \

Commander Bracken first saw
service in the'Paciﬂc and was
then transferred to Aruba-Cura-
cao. At present he is stationed at
‘Trinidad, where he is aide and
ﬂight lieutenant to the command-
ant,‘ and where he commands his
own ship.

Commander Bracken, whose
home is at 6112 Alder Street, Pitts-
burgh, went to Philadelphia after
graduating from Pitt and practiced
law there for a short time before
joining the Navy. He has two
brothers in service. Major Mark
M. Bracken, also a Pitt graduate
in 1934, is in charge of the lab-
oratory of a Pitt hospital unit in
the Paciﬁc area, and Lt. Frank B.
Bracken is at present an instructor
in this country.

ates on an accelerated program,
making it possible to ﬁnish the
course in three years instead of
four. This is done by eliminating
the summer vacation, allowing
only four weeks of free time per
year. The senior class will gradu-
at-e this June, and the servicemen
will receive their commissions at
that time.

 Desires
Wood-Wind,
Cello Players

If you can toot a horn or pluck
a ﬁddle, the place for you is in
the concert band or the school
orchestra.

The band consists of 38 mem-
bers, a sufficient number, but Rob-
ert L. Arthur, music director at
Pitt, has offered a chance to one
ﬂute player, one oboe player, one
bassoon player an-d two French
horn players to join. “We can"
always use a few good additional
players,” he said. ‘

*Dire-ctor Arthur, who was in
naval avia*tion for two yea-rs as a
lieutenant, is very enthusiastic
about the band th-is year.

The band hopes to be ready to
appear in public soon and is busy
preparing concert programs.

The orchestra is also preparing
for concerts, but like the band,
it needs a few more good players

. . celloists and wood-wind play-
ers. Director Arthur, in telling of
the plans of the orchestra, ‘said’,
“It has always been my hope that
more use would be made of the
orchestra for University events.
A salon orchestra has been assem-
bled to perform at the places
where that type of music is
needed.” '

If you can make music with a
cello or ﬂute, horn or bassoon,
see Mr. Arthur in the dean of
men’s ofﬁce Monday to Friday
from 9 to 5 o’-clock. Rehearsals for
the band are on Tuesdays from
7 to 9 o’clock at Stephen Foster
memorial; for the orchestra, onl
Thursdays.
