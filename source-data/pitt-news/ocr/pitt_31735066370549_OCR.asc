Board overturns UnitedFaculty Ruling

Pete Brasko III
For The Pitt News

In a victory for the United Faculty,ra group
of Pitt professors seeking collective bargain-
ing, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board
last week reversed a hearing examiner's rul-
ing that the United Faculty did not‘ have
enough support for a collective bargaining
election.

Earlier, board examiner Elliot Newman had
ruled that the United Faculty did not have the
required number of signature cards from pro-
fessors at Pitt in favor of unionization. But
United Faculty President Dr. Philip Wion said
he could not understand why the hearing ex-
aminer made the ruling he did.

”According to the rules, 30 percent of the
eligible faculty members have to sign cards
in order to force an election,” Wion said.
”We turned in about 775 cards, which is well

above the required number [675].”

Wion thinks that about 2,250 faculty
members at Pitt are eligible for collective
bargaining, but he is not certain of that.

”The board gave us very little information
to go on as far as how many members were

eligible, or how many valid cards were turned _

in. We were operating pretty much in the
dark,” Wion said. '

He speculates one of the reasons why the
examiner ruled the way he did was because
of misplaced cards, or an inaccurate list of

‘ faculty members being turned over to the

board by the university administration. Wion
is happy that the appeal by the United Faculty
has cleared the way for an election to take
place among eligible faculty members as to
whether or not they should unionize. But
Wion isn't sure when that election will take
place.

”The administration apparently is not go-
ing to let us have a democratic election

amongst ourselves, because they plan to
bring up the issue of shared governance and
the Yeshiva case,” said Wion.

The Yeshiva case refers to a 1980 Supreme
Court decision that said faculty at Yeshiva col-
lege were managers, and therefore not eligi-
ble for collective bargaining. The Yeshiva

argument, Wion feels, is exactly what the

university administration may use to try and
stop an election from taking place.

University counsel Lewis Popper said the
administration has not made up its mind yet
whether it will use the idea of shared gover-
nance to try and block an election, but he
would not rule out the possibility. Popper
also said the administration opposes faculty
unionization at Pitt because Pitt is a major
research institution. V,

”Pitt is one of the country's leading
research centers,” he said, ”and because
that's the case, faculty here are in a different
situation than at other colleges and univer-

sities.” Popper pointed out that Pitt is a
member of the American Association of
Universities, which is an organization of
about 54 of the nation'_s leading research
universities. He also said that not one of the
AAU’s members has a situation where facul-
ty have collective bargaining.

Wion feels decidedly different about this
issue, however. He said that other institutions
of higher learning in Pennsylvania have facul-
ty with collective bargaining power. These

management and faculty get along fine, and ‘

there are not many problems. He cited Tem-
ple and Lincoln "universities as examples. ‘

The key factor in the case of Yeshiva, ac- E

cording to Wion, is that Pitt is a state—re|ated

university, whereas Yeshiva was a private in- as"

stitution. Because of that difference, Pitt falls
under state law rather than national law.
Wion referred to Act 1935, the Pennsylvania
Public Relations Employee Act.

The running class met in winter

marathon. The students ran through
four phases of preparation, with the
object being to peak on May 18th,

They will provide relief to runners
who have difficulty with the rigorous
course.

The toughest part of the course is
expected to be at Forbes Avenue
leading into Oakland from
downtown. The race will begin on
Butler Street near Morningside and
will end at Point State Park. The first
half will be run through
Lawrenceville, North Side, South
Side, Oakland and Shadyside. From
there it will continue through
Homewood, Brushton, East Liberty,

Lieutenant governor speaks on

Kathy Stahl

News Editor

Last Wednesday at the University
of Pittsburgh Lieutenant Governor
William Scranton and State Senator
Michael Fisher proposed a series of
initiatives to improve Pennsylvania's
schools.

Scranton said that he chose educa-
tion as the first of several policy
papers addressing critical issues in
Pennsylvania because of its impor-
tance to the future of the state, and
because it represents the starting
point in bringing permanent im-
provements to the commonwealth.

”The fundamental changes occur-
ing in our state must be met with fun-
damental changes in the system of
‘our state,” said Scranton. ”The heart
of this proposal is to make basic
education more responsive to the real

needs of our commonwealth now
and in the world ahead.

”The new source of economic
power in our state will not be wealth
in the hands of a few,” said Scran-
ton, ”but knowledge in the hands of
many.” -

Scranton said that over the past
eight years many programs have
been initiated to upgrade the quality
of education. Scranton said that he
wants to continue and further this
trend by increasing the accountability
of Pennsylvania's schools to the
public, by raising academic expecta-
tions and by enhancing the quality
and status of teachers.

. ”We would propose to publish
report cards on the various school
buildings,” said Scranton, ”and to
enhance the quality of teachers ‘by
providing scholarships to the best

V students.”

Scranton and Fisher also propose
to raise the enrollment standards for
students majoring in education. They
would also require high school
seniors to pass a basic math, reading
and writing skills test before
graduating.

State aid to local school districts

would be increased by increasing the-

percentage of the state budget given
to education. There would also be
supplemental state funds for early
childhood programs, such as
Headstart.

Scranton said that over the past
years, increases in state funding have
allowed for significant gains in educa-
tion, but he feels that more must be
done.

. Raising taxes, according to Scran-
ton, is worth it to develop quality in
the education system.

”All the hotels in downtown
Pittsburgh are booked,” said Boyles.

WASHINGTON — Deputy
Secretary of State John Whitehead
said that the United States now ”has
no reason to doubt” that Syria and
Libya were invovled in the bombing
of a West Berlin disco that triggered
a military raid on Libya. Whitehead
also said that there is no reason to

about Syrian involvement came from
lsrael, but there is no reason to doubt
it. Syrian officials have repeatedly
denied any involvement in either in-

NASA had cold
weather warning

According to a newly disclosed
document, NASA was given the
results of a test showing that safety
seals in the space shuttle’s booster
rockets could fail at temperatures of
50 degrees or lower nearly six
months before the Challenger
disaster. Ruptures of both the primary
and backup seals of the shuttle’s
rocket booster now have been pin-
pointed as the cause of the Jan. 28
disaster which killed all seven
astronauts aboard. The Challenger

Syria linked to Berlin bombing

was launched in far colder weather
than any other previous flight.

The newly disclosed document is
a letter from an engineer of Morton
Thiokol lnc., the rockets’ manufac-
turer, to officials at a space agency
center in Alabama. The letter con-
tradicts testimony by NASA officials
that there was no correlation between
low temperatures and the failure of
seals.

the first known time that anyone has

nounced reprisals against three Com-

the three of ”shirking their duties.”
Apparently though, the three are con-

the four reactors at the plant. Experts
said that the action may be the start

’ Deaver appears to

have broken law

Yesterday, the General Accounting
Office told Congress that former
White House Deputy Chief of Staff
Michael Deaver ”appears” to have
broken conflict-of-interest laws. The
agency then sent its findings to the
Justice Department to determine if
Deaver should be prosecuted. The
GAO,‘ an investigative arm of Con-
gress, investigated Deaver over a five-

month period to try to determine if.

Deaver broke the law when he began
a lobbying business that represents
several foreign governments, in-
cluding Canada. Deaver allegedly us-
ed his influence to move the Reagan
administration toward an acid rain
agreement with Canada. Deaver has
denied that he broke the law, and
President Reagan, a close friend of
Deaver’s, has repeatedly defended
him.

White water ra

By David Zuchowski
Staff Writer

When I was a kid, I would
stand on the crest of a hill at our
small farm in Washington County
in early spring. I stood there with
awe and longing, drawn to the
verdant woods that covered the
old time—worn Appalachians. This
spring I decided to revisit the
mountains that I loved as a child
and brave their rugged rapids on
the Youghiogheny at Ohiopyle

My buddies and I arrived at the
-‘meeting site around 10 a.m., and
we changed into rented suits pro-,
vided by the touring group.
Although the temperature was a
warm 75 degrees, the early April
water was a mere 45. The wet
suits came in handy because we
were splashed and sprayed by the
powerful waves; one of my bud-
dies was even washed overboard
during the trip. Our guide said
that a person could last about an

‘hour in the frigid water before

hypothermia and unconsciousness
set in, but the wet suits kept us so
warm that we did not notice the
water temperature.

We entered the Yough on a six-
man reinforced neoprene raft just
below Ohiopyle Falls. The raft
rental was reasonable, especially
considering that the rafts cost in
excess of $1,000 each. I wanted
to take an early spring trip,
because I thought the water level
would be at its highest and the
rapids at their swiftest. I later

with a raft tour operated by Moun-l
’ tain Streams and Trails.

discovered this is not always the
case, because the Youghiogheny
Darn controls the water flow to a
large extent. The water level
behind the dam is kept lowduring
the winter to allow for the winter
snow and spring runoff. In a
heavy rain runoff from the
tributary Castleman River can add
a hefty volume of water to the

' Yough. The time of year is not the
only factor influencing the water's
depth. Our guide also pointed out
that some of the rapids were ac-
tually swifter and more dangerous
at low water levels.

The river run is a 7‘/2 mile
length of both rapids and calm
water stretches. The river drops 48
feet over the first mile of the trip,
making it one of the steepest river
descents in the East, and drops an
average of 12 feet per mile
thereafter. Average speed over the
course of the trip is only 6-8 miles

We got our feet wet, both
literally and figuratively, when we
went through our first series of
rapids shortly after entering the
water. We had to paddle with
maximum effort to negotiate
through the rocks that straddled
the main channel, and the raft was
tossed and thrown so violently

that I almost fell overboard. I ap-
preciated the calm stretch that we
spilled into as it gave me a
chance to catch my breath. We
negotiated through a series of 17
rapids, bearing names like Dart-
mouth, Railroad, Dimple, Double
Hydrolic, Killer Falls, Maze, Brun-
ner Pass, Eddy Turn and Piddley.

There were 10 rafts on the tour
with us, with one guide for every
two rafts. There were several
turnouts along the way where we
stopped and rested. This enabled
the guides to clue us in as to what
lay ahead and the way we should
negotiate the upcoming rapids. At
one of the turnouts we grounded
the rafts and had an outdoor
lunch that was provided by the
tour group.

The guides were each given one
of the most extensive training pro-
grams in the East. They not only
insured our safety, but also took
us through the most exciting chan-
nels and helped us from running
aground. Over the course of the
trip, three people went overboard,
but no one was ever in any
serious danger.

ifthe family derives pleasure from pushy
crowds, the burning sun and cranky lit-

What is a family to do? If smart, family
members will look out theirown win-

go away to really be ”on vacation.”
Consider Pittsburgh. We fail to see the
city's possibilities. Pittsburgh offers its
regatta, the Shakespeare festival, a
marathon and of course the symphony.
Now that the Bucs are playing hardball,
there's P absolutely no reason to go
elsewhere for entertainment this summer.

ZBT: Unfair move

The story on Zeta Beta Tau’s
demise in the May 7 issue didn't in-
clude a few aspects of the situation.
Not only by your story, we seem to
have been forgotten by ZBT’s na-
tional government as well. There was
a winter term pledge class involved
in this dispute.

I was one of those pledges. I par-
ticipated in last fall term rush as a
freshman, and although it wasn't my
first time in a fraternity house, ZBT
was the first fraternity that I stepped
into at Pitt. I met a lot of fun people,
had a great time and got a very good
first impression of the fraternity
system at Pitt. Unfortunately, this feel-
ing was not carried through at other
fraternities. After getting beer spilled

‘ on myself (constantly), squashed by

crowds, trampled (always when you
can't avoid it), ignored and sick, I
started going back to the Zebe house
regularly. In winter rush I wouldn't
have gone anywhere else. I struggled
through, anyone in a fraternity can
tell you, the hell of being a pledge
while fighting to maintain my current
3.83 QPA. Then, a few days before
it was over, I was handed back my
$220 initiation fee and told, so to
speak, ”It’s been fun  but we're
done." This, I might add, in the mid-
dle of finals week. I now am not af-
filiated in any way with ZBT.

I was shocked, and I still don't
think that national has made the cor-
rect decision. Mr. Simon, you were
quoted as saying, ”There have been
a lot of problems recently within the
fraternity. I will be the first to admit

Letters to the Editor

that there were some problems in the
fraternity, but these were not so large
that, with some work, they could not
be overcome. The article also quoted
you as saying, ”There was no effort
being made to increase the number
of brothers.” This, Mr. Simon, is a lie.
There were 26 active brothers in
'85-'86. Five of them would have
graduated by next year, but there
were 11 pledges in this same period.
There would have been a net in-
crease in active brother membership
for the academic year '86-'87 of 23
percent compared to '85-'86. This
hardly constitutes ”no effort!”

This was effort without any help
from the trustees. You supposedly
said that
planned a Super Bowl party last fall.
We told the brothers that we would
supply color televisions and soda, but
the whole thing laid an egg. I have
to laugh at this Mr. Simon. First ofall,
I think that we were perfectly capable
of throwing a party without the help
of our trustees. Secondly, while com-

' peting forpledges as a small house

against the larger houses — and
against some horribly misinformed
and childish name-calling by the stu-
dent body — all of this (we must
remember) while there was still a wet
rush; having a TV and soda party is
the most excellent way that I can
think of to have an empty house! Try
offering this deal to any other frater-
nity on campus and see how long it
would take to get thrown, out. I
assume that you wouldn't even get
past the door.

I admit that there were financial
problems and some dispute between

[you and some trustees]-

the brothers. They, however,’ were
simply not that major. My pledge
class and I had discussed privately
(and at great length) the difficulties
that we would have to face. We were
confident that a lot could be done
within the fraternity. Did the trustees
not consider the unity of the phi and
chi pledge classes of last fall and
winter terms as a strong base for a
new beginning? I think not. I don't
even think that they knew who we
were. I know that I never met any of
them. Mr. Simon, you are probably

‘surprised as you are reading this —

and I hope that you are reading this
—- that I was a pledge in your frater-
nity. There must have been a better
solution. .

An official probationary period
would have been infinitely more
helpful than this. But, since you and
the trustees have chosen this course,
I must wish you luck. With zero ac-
tive membership you are now the
smallest fraternity at Pitt. If you are
to start fresh next year, you must deal
with the unfortunately misguided
opinion of ZBT by the student body
— don't assume that freshmen don't
talk to upperclassmen. Most impor-
tantly, trustees, you must deal with
rebuilding your integrity to prospec-
tive pledges. I know that if I were a

rushee this fall who was seriously‘

considering pledging a fraternity, I
would think twice about ZBT —
where the fraternity’s government
supports you only in the good times
but will drop you at the first sign of

trouble.

Reality: the week in review

I've been back from Denver for
three weeks now, and I'm regretting
having ever left there. The boundless
optimism and energy which I return-
ed with has degenerated into the
dailv routine of existing in beautiful
Oakland. And I'm mad.

First, there is this annoying habit
some drivers have of running the red
light on Forbes Avenue by the
William Pitt Union. I swear I’m go-
ing to sit there with a camera and
record your acts of vehicular bad
manners in order to get you into the
traffic kangaroo court — a place from
which few escape unscathed. I'm not
asking for the total banning of
vehicles on this campus — yet. Too
many of us have been run over by
those of you driving too fast without
any regard for pedestrians. Watch it.

Then, I get carded in a certain bar
— I won't give it's name, but many
call it the Mortuary —— a few nights
ago by a doorman who tried to hit me
up for a dollar cover charge on a
night when there was no cover
charge. At my age, people suffer from
senility and can't remember to pack
a driver's license, especially when
one doesn't own a car anymore. A
Pitt I.D. stating that I had been here
since 1980 didn’t satisfy the bouncer,
so I happily left remembering every
reason why I never drank there for
the last six years.

The half case of Heineken Dark,
which I had placed in my stomach
the night before, had crept inside my
skull, aggravating the few brain cells
that still talk to each other. By coin-
cidence my neighbor

of sunworshipping, treated the
greater Oakland vicinity to a three
hour tour de force of Creedence
Clearwater Revival, whom I am now
certain is really Bachman Turner
Overdrive recorded incognito.

I actually went to all ot my cIasSeS
last week, for what reason I can't
understand. Lately, I've been so lazy,
I have had to be talked into going
nude sunbathing.

A certain local newspaper made
me very happy when they refused to
run the ad for my book in classifieds
because it's a mail order business and
they could only take me for about
$30. They're happy to run ads for
those job lists scams or Pliofle

. businesses, but if I want my ad to aP'

Bib e thumpers make proclamations of old sins in "New right”

There’s a movement that's gaining
momentum in this country that real-
ly scares me. Call it the "New Right,”
the Moral Majority or anything else
you want. This movement is gaining
strength and expanding its sphere of
influence as the rest of America sits
back and watches in silence. This
movement is composed of a number
of Christian fundamentalist groups
that, regardless of their titles, have
one thing in common: Bible-
thumping “Christian” intolerance.

I have nothing against conservative
politics, and it's fine if you place
credence in the Bible. It's the com-
bination of the two that is dangerous.

In the United States, we have a
wonderful thing called the separation
of church andgstate. It's always been
a part of the Constitution and,
hopefully, will always be there. In re-
cent years, however, these loud
groups of born-again flag-wavers
have taken it upon themselves to try
to weaken this separation in the
name of "saving” the United States.

These folk dare to invoke the name
of the most peace-loving, tolerant
man in the history of" humanity as
they burn classic literature, try to
restrict the freedom of expression and
bomb abortion clinics.

smells worse than an unbathed

Capping off my week was the
peace officer in a certain local
restaurant who treated the entire
place to pleasant dinner conversation
about the rash of warts that were
slowly taking over his body:
numbers, locations and great details
of how he hoped to have them
treated. I wonder if he drinks at the
Mortuary?

They claim to be following the
teachings of Christ. It seems to me
that they are following only part of
what Christ taught. Sure, he was very
outspoken when discussing what was
right and wrong. But if my memory
serves me correctly, one of Jesus’ best
friends was a prostitute, a woman by
the name of Mary Magdalene. She
was one of the most influential peo-

ple in his life. And didn't Christ also

go out of his way to fraternize with
the low lifes of his society? Look at
the kind of people with whom he ate.
They weren't the ”morally outstan-
ding” of his day. They were the tax
collectors, lepers and prostitutes. He
also became very angry when he saw
people using the temple to conduct
business. Hear that Jim and Tammy
Bakker and the rest of you TV
evangelists?

Now I ask you, when was the last
time you saw the Moral Majority or
the PTL club establish a center to give
comfort to the morally downtrodden.
.I don't mean a place where they can
go to hearthat they are going to hell
either, but a place to find comfort, to
find refuge from the streets. It would
be refreshing to see the same people
who are telling homosexuals that
they get AIDS as a punishment for

their lifestyles, set up clinics for AIDS
victims. People in trouble need sup-
port, not condemnation. Granted,
homosexuals and prostitutes stand for
something totally opposite of that
which "good Christians” hold near
and dear, but does the Reverend
Falwell skip over the passages that
refer to treating others as he would
like to be treated or how about "Let
he who is among you without sin,
cast the first stone?”

People who use the Bible as a
sword have been around for cen-
turies. They've been powerful in the
past, but during the 60s and 705 they
apparently faded onto the back
burner. But they're back on
primetime. There’s even a TV
evangelist" named Pat Robertson
who's trying to win the nomination
for president in 1988. On my belov-
ed party's ticket! Yikes! When will it
stop?

They're making strides, taking
ground bit by bit. They demand that
certain changes be made in our socie-
ty. I'll agree that there are changes
that need to be made. But would
outlawing the sale of contraceptives,
requiring mothers to stay at home
and raise their families, making kids
pray in public schools, prohibiting

references to evolution in biology
classes or removing Salinger, Von-
negut and Shakespeare from library
shelves do a whole lot of good? I
think not.

Why don't these "Christian Ac-
tivists” read their Bibles to see what's
really there —- compassion and
tolerance, not bookburnings and hate
groups.

Now, I don't expect them to aban-
don their cause. They're assured of
their right to believe what they want

‘by the same Constitution that

guarantees my right to criticize their
beliefs. We need strong conservatives
as much as we need strong liberals.
That, friends and neighbors, is call-
ed democracy. But I'm asking
mainstream America to wake up to
see that our civil rights are being
jeopordized.

It's great if you have a faith that you
live, but don't tell me what I can or
cannot see, hear, read or believe.
This has been a reading from the
gospel according to P. Gregory
Amater.

Lydie Breeze storms onto the
beach with a dried gardenia in hand
to confront her husband, Joshua
Hickman, for his carelessness. The

plant was meant as a legacy for.

daughter Gussie, ”something with
roots,” vital, on solid ground. Lydie
is indignant because she'd left the
gardenia in her husband's care while
she was away on a nursing job.

Joshua neglected the plant to spite
Lydie, he tells her 50 years later in
his prison cell. The withered plant
symbolizes the crumbling of dreams
in John Guare’s play Gardenia cur-
rently at the Pittsburgh Public
Theater.

Three men and a woman purchase
land on Nantucket Island to set up a
commune they call Aipotu. The
woman, Lydie, served as nurse to the
three Civil War veterans she has
drawn to her. They escapaed Grant's
corrupt government into this self-
exile to prove that man can live at
peace with man and with nature. But
they didn't consider their own cor-
ruptability. The commune collapses
under the strain of their own vices:
greed, lust, even murder. Lydie acts
as the main support of the group
which includes an idealist (Joshua),
a realist (Amos) and a sensualist (Dan
Grady).

Lydie’s passions knock the

idealistic props from under her. In the

face of hard cash, personal desires
overrule the utopian visions of this
communal household.

Guare sets his play in a period

‘when religious and philosophical

leaders founded various communes.
The Quakers, the Mormons, the
Naturalists all gathered momentum
at this time. During the social
upheaval of the 1960s many were
disillusioned with the established in-
stitutions and moved to the country
to live off the land.

‘ But time has proven over and over

again that without a religious dogma
for support, such ventures cave in
eventually. Guare’s characters are no
exception; they can't transcend the
weaknesses in their own nature to
fulfill the dream.

Ray Recht’s set designs underscore
the tone of the play. The entire first
act takes place on the beach, the sec-
ond in Joshua's prison cell. Sparse

. . . . . . . . . , , . .

clumps of grass and granite surround
the little wooden bridge capturing
Aipotu’s simplicity in the first act. The
printing press in Joshua's cell evokes
the sense of inner freedom which
writing and printing his own book
has afforded him.

Even though the staging conveys
the mood of the play, the perform-
ances do not. William Carden’s
quivering portrayal of Joshua is out
of sync with the dialogue. Carden
performs well only when he puts on
the Indian costume that Amos intends
to wear to the town parade.

Caryn West's Lydie lacks the emo-
tional complexity her character
demands. Frank Hankey’s perform-
ance is too laidback to make the am-
bitious and scheming Amos credible.
Only Steven Culp as Dan Grady
gives a noteworthy performance.

Gardenia will be performed at the
Pittsburgh Public Theater through
May 18. Call 321-9800 for ticket

Big Audio Dynamite: ”Medicine
Show”

The latest single to be released
from This is Big Audio Dynamite (the
first album by Mick Jones’s post-Clash
project, B.A.D.), is an instantly
danceable fun—time party track with
lyrics that will leave you scratching
your Pitt Panther heads. A studio-
complicated funk profusion leaving
you in a state of pop confusion, this
is an intoxicatingly refreshing change
of pace from the usual Top 40
boredom. The only and obvious
shortcoming of the song is that it

Page 7

lacks the underlying passion that
moved ”The Bottom Line,” B.A.D.’s
debut single from the album and the
only song of the bunch that really
catches fire.

Although many people viewed
their first album as a ”Big Audio
Disappointment,” I’d rather look at
it as an experimental success laying
the groundwork for bigger and bet-
ter things in the future. But please,
don't concern yourselves with such
trivialities. Just relax and keep danc-
ing to that jumped—up 21st century
disco hip—hop that the B.A.D. boys
play so well.

David Bowie’s artistic achieve-
ments of the 1970s have had an un-
deniable influence on countless
musicians. Constantly changing gears
and confounding expectations, he in-
sisted upon following his impulses as
a true artist should. The David Bowie
discography of recent years has been
gaining in consistency and is increas-
ingly pop oriented.

Things artistic are usually spoiled
by things capitalistic, such is not the
case with this absolutely swingin’
movie soundtrack. This track would
fit_comfortably next to any of the hits
off 1983s Let's Dance, differing on-

ly in its more dignified and polished
sound. Bowie’s singing communi-
cates the song’s sensitive appeal
through the simplicity of the lyrics.
An artistic success with commercial
appeal, David Bowie has not com-
promised quality for a large bank
account.

A shrine of Chinese cuisine

”Moo Goo Ga-Ga,” I exclaimed in

, my frenzy of indecision after perus-

ing the moderately priced menu of
over a hundred Chinese dishes from
Peking, Szechuan, Shanghai and
Canton at Iimmy Tsang’s Chinese
Restaurant. ’ ’
The dining experience, and
perhaps the flavor itself, is enhanced
by the late imperial accents of the
decor. Guests are greeted by a scale-
model junk and scenic oriental
screens in the foyer. Parchment
watercolors adorn panelled pillars,
and walls display murals of tradi-
tional oriental landscapes. The am-
biance was inviting and intriguing.
Jimmy Tsang’s is the only establish-
ment in Pittsburgh which stocks
several of the special Chinese and
Japanese wines and liquors offered.

with a dispenser of savory Chinese

Without the services of All-America
Lee "McRae and several other top-
notch runners, the Pitt Panther track
team was more a squad of the
running wounded than a healthy
group of athletes at the Pitt Invita-
tional last Saturday.

”We did about as good a job as we
could have,” head men’s track coach
John Vasvary said after the meet.
”Considering all the people we had
out due to injury, I think we did pret-
ty well.”

Highlights of the meet for Panther
fans were freshman David Moore’s
blistering time of 1:47.7 in the 800
meters, Lori Woods’ first place finish
in the 5,000 meters, and Pitt’s mile
relay team's second place finish with
a time of 3:09.9 /

For his finish Moore won the John
Woodruff Award for 800 meters.
Moore’s time was not only good
enough for the esteemed Mr.
Woodruff, but the NCAA was duly
impressed as well and Moore earned
a spot at the NCAA Track and Field
Championships in Indianapolis in
June.

Vasvary said he also expects Tim
Manes, who finished third in the 800
meters, to qualify for the
championships.

McRae was sidelined with a pulled

hamstring muscle, a serious enough
injury, but not one that is considered
career threatening.

”He couldn't run in the Big East
championships because of it,”
Vasvary said of McRae. ”He tried to
run in the 100, but he had to slow
down at the end. We didn’t use him
last Saturday and he won't be
available for our next meet either. It's
a precautionary thing. We don't want
to take any chances. To be honest I
don't know for sure when he'll be
back.”

It was the Penn State track team
which dominated the meet. The
Nittany Lions finished first in the 4 X
100 relay, shot put (Gregg Reyner),
long jump (Dave Coney), 1,500
meters (Steve Shisler), 110 high
hurdles (Michael Timpson), 400 IM
hurdles (Ray Levitee), 200 meters
(Michael Timpson), the 5,000 meters
(Eric Carter) and the 4 X 400 relay.

For winning two events Timpson
was awarded the Arthur C. Toner
Award for,Outstanding Participants.

The Pitt women fared better than
the men, however. Rene Henderson
won the 100 meters with a time of

Festival

The opening competition phase
of the Coca-Cola National Col-
legiate Sports Festival, presented
by Coppertone, has ended and
the teams winningtrips back to
Daytona Beach have been
determined.

The N.C.S.F. ”Final Four”
weekend will be held in Daytona
Beach and will be headquartered
at Penrod’s Plaza Hotel, broadcast
location for MTV during the net-
work's spring break coverage this
March.

The National Collegiate Sports
Festival is a sports ‘promotion
group owned by members of the
Daytona Beacharea. The N.C.S.F.
was founded by Casey Leydon, a
native Floridian and graduate of
the University of Mississippi.
Leydon’s reasons for starting such
a project were sharp and clear:
He was concerned with the un-
wholesome and unsafe direction
that Spring Break in Daytona
Beach was headed. Leydon’s
decision to ban alcohol and
tobacco sponsors from the festival
hasreceived tremendous support
from the Daytona community, the
students and collegiate intramural
directors nationwide. ,

Beginning April 6 and running
for four weeks, students from 62
colleges and universities
representing over 30' states com-
peted in eight sports. ’They are
basketball, flag football, golf,
rugby, 5K running, softball,
ultimate frisbee and volleyball.
The student-athletes, more than
600 total, are all non-athletic
scholarship and are intramural or
club team members. They played
in the sport of their choice, some
choosing to play in two sports,
most notably Western Kentucky,
whose players captured first place
during week one in both basket-
ball and flag football.

Although the University of Pitts-

‘ burgh did not compete in the
tournament, several area schools
were on hand including West
Virginia, Slippery Rock, Ohio
State and Ohio University.

Bruce signs recruit

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

The Lady Panther basketball pro-
gram recently added another good
recruit for next season, but at the
same time lost a potentially great one
because of an injury.

Karen Threatt, a 5-7 guard from St.
Anthony's High School in Jersey”City,
New Jersey, has signed a letter-of-
intent to play for the Lady Panthers
next season.

Head coach Kirk Bruce is pleased
about his latest recruit. ”Karen was
the starting point guard on her high
school team and she did a fine job,"
said Bruce. ”She has pretty good
quickness and is a good all-around
performer.”

Threatt, who came from the same
high school that produced college
men's star David Rivers of Notre
Dame, averaged 12 points per game
and eight assists per contest, leading
her team to the Southern divisiontitle
in Hudson County.

The signing of Threatt was caused
by the loss of Lady Panther recruit
Lori Johnson, a 5-11 guard/forward
from Pittsburgh's New Castle High
SchooL

Johnson will sit out next season
with a medical redshirt because of a
knee injury she suffered in a playoff
game in March.

Johnson is scheduled to undergo
surgery sometime in early June and
will be in a cast for six weeks.

Coach Bruce is disappointed to,
lose his star recruit, but he doesn't
want to rush her back too soon, since
there is a possibility Johnson could
be ready to play by mid-January.

”Lori could possibly be ready for
the Big East season, but she would
miss the first 10 games or so of the
year and I don't think it makes sense
to rush her back,” commented Bruce.

Johnson's injury throws the Lady
Panthers backcourt situation into total
disarray. With last season's starting
guards Kim Gannis and Kim Tirik
both graduating, Coach Bruce has to
find two new backcourt starters.
Although Bruce will not say so,
Johnson's signing was thought to
assure her a starting spot at the off-
guard position. But now the situation
has been altered.

The off-guard spot will be a battle
between no less than five players.
Sophomores Jill Sitlinger, Shaunda
Byrd and Amy Holman will do bat-
tle with incoming freshmen Jenny
Schingler and Threatt for the starting
assignment. Schingler is a first team
All-State player from Altoona High
School, the No. 1 ranked high school
girls team in the country this past
season. ‘

Lewis reviews season

‘Pitt baseball coach Bobby Lewis
can look back and smile, and that’s
saying something since his team just
completed a 10-22 season.

"It was a fine season,” said Lewis.
”Sure, we were all disappointed with
the record, but we bounced back
from a bad start, showed what we
were made of, and had some fun.
And_l think the sun will shine a few
times this summer just the same.”

Lewis, who lives in Upper St. Clair,
has coached the Pitt baseball team for
thirty-two seasons and has seen
enough to know what’s really
important.

”We won our opening game
against Brooklyn College and then

‘lost 16 straight games. I'm sure I've
' never been associated with any team

that lost that many games in a row.
It could have been devastating. Our

kids are young and they could have
folded their tents real easily. But they
didn't. We had a lot of toughies, too,
because they really didn't know how
to win. That's something they learned
the hard way.

”Most of our guys will be back
and, if we get a couple pitchers, we
could have a fine team next season."

The Panthers won eight of their
final thirteen games, including vic-
tories over rivals such as Penn State,
West Virginia and Seton Hall (one of
the best teams in the Big East).

”Our best player is only a
sophomore,” Lewis said, ”and he's
a real leader. That's Brian Lohman.”

Lohman, a Mt. Lebanon native, led
the Panthers with a .353 batting
average and a school record of nine
home runs.

PROVIDENCE COLLEGE’, -
Representatives announced that Herb
Sendek, a graduate assistant at Pro-
vidence last year, has been promoted
to the position of full—time assistant
coach by the Friars first year mentor
Rick Pitino.

Sendek is a Pittsburgh native and
was Valedictorian at Penn Hills High
School in 1981. Sendek furthered his
studies at Carnegie-Mellon University
where he maintained his record of
academic excellence. Last May, he
graduated first in his class at CMU
with a 3.9 QPA.

A former captain of his high school

basketball team, Sendek is replacing A

Bill Donlon who has accepted a top
assistant job at Northwestern.

 

SETON HALL — Representatives
announced that they signed two men
and one woman to join the ranks of
Pirate roundballers next year. One of
the three is Nick Katsikis, a forward
from Cherry Hill, N.J. Katsikis was a
three—year starter at Cherry Hill, pil-
ing up 1,568 points in his career, a
20.3 per game average. Katsikis was
named to The Philadelpia Enquirer’s
all-area team this past season.

One player the Piratesrwill look for
immediate help from is Thomas
”Junior” Curtis, ‘va junior-college
transfer. Curtis is the 6-1, 185-pound
guard who led Westark Community
College of Fort Smith, Ark., to the
Junior College Region ll Champion-
ship last season. Westark was where

legiate starts.

The addition to the Seton Hall

finished the 1986 season with its first
winning record in five years. The
Wildcats were 21-20-1 overall and
8-10 in the Big East. ”l’m happy that
we had a winning record,” first—year
coach George Bennett said. ”We
were a young team, but we showed
some signs of coming back in games
that we could have lost. We won
some games we probably shouldn't
have/’ _

The sport of baseball has been
played continuosly at Villanova since
May 2, 1866. in 120 years the
Wildcats are 942-634-19.

Rugby
Benefit

Final preparations are now under-
way for the First Annual Rugby Tour-
nament to benefit the Travelers Aid
Society of Pittsburgh. It will be held
Saturday, May 17 beginning at 12:30
at Hartwood Acres.

The tournament is chaired by Dr.
Anthony J.F. O’Reilly, president of
the H.J. Heinz Company.

O’Reilly is a rugby enthusiast. As
a player in Ireland, O’Reilly found the
sport challenging and rewarding. ’’I
remain interested in the sport and
have always wanted to bring the
staunchly amateur game to the
general public. This benefit should
do just that,” O’Reilly said.

Tournament-goers will be parked
surrounding the playing field and will
be free to tailgate and visit with others
attending the tournament. According
to O’Reilly, ”  quite similar to the
Rolling Rock races years past.”

Pirates Update

The Pittsburgh Pirates continue to .

have their troubles playing at Three
Rivers Stadium, losing nine of their
first 14 home games. Another home
loss was avoided last Sunday when
shortstop Bill Almon hit an inside-the-
park home run to propel the Pirates
to a 4-3, 12-inning victory over the
Western division leading Houston
Houston Astros.

A|mon’s homer, his fifth of the
year, appeared to be nothing more
than a bloop single to right field. But
Astro outfielder Terry Puhl misplayed
the ball, allowing it to bounce over
his head and roll to the wall, enabl-
ing Almon to score.

The winning pitcher was Jose
DeLeon, who was recently recalled
from the Pirates AAA farm team in
Hawaii. DeLeon, winning his first
game in over 11 months, pitched 3
7/3 innings of shutout ball to earn the
victory.

share of fourth-place in the Eastern,
Division with the St. Louis Cardinals.

For games played through Sunday,
May 11, Pirate second baseman
Johnny Ray continues to lead the
league in hitting at .373 with 22 RBIs.
First baseman Sid Bream has been a
pleasant surprise, batting .300 with
5 home runs and 15 RBIs. Other im-
pressive Pirate averages include out-
fielders R.J. Reynolds(.290), Joe Or-
sulak(.271) and Mike Brown(.270).
Also, veteran third baseman Jim Mor-
rison surprisingly leads the team with
six home runs.

Starting pitcher Mike Bielecki leads
the staff with a 3-0 record, while
Cecilio Guante (two wins, one save,
1.25 ERA) and Bob Walk (one win,
one save, 2.54 ERA) continue to pitch
well out of the bullpen.

The Pirates conclude their eight-
game homestand tonight at 7:35
against the San Diego Padres. The
Bucs then take to the road for a
weekend three game series with the
cellar-dwelling Cincinnati Reds.
