Crisler Urges
Pitt Assembly

As Annual Fete

Griffiths Cites Worth
Of Sports in Defense

In paying tribute to 200 Pitt
lettermen and the freshman
football squad a.t the Pitt Sports
assembly banquet last Friday
night in the Commons Room, 0.

H. (Fritz) Crisler, head‘ football

-coach of the ‘University of Michi-

gan, stated that the banquet was
a “good investment” and should
be held every year.

Mr. Crisler, guest speaker at the
banquet at which 700 sports en-
thusiasts were gathered, declared
that the “function of football in the
educational scheme i.s one of emo-
tion . . . and the football ﬁeld is
the laboratory where these emo-
tions are shaped to take a part in
our social structure.”

The other off-campus guest
speaker was Major John L. Grif-
ﬁths, athletic commissioner of the

Western conference. Introduced by '

toastmaster Dr. H. ' L. Mitchell,
associate professor of neurology,
Major Griffiths declared, “We have
gotten more from Pitt than Pitt has
from us.”

His talk hinged on the subject
of sports as the greatest aid in
physical training in a non-compul-
sory set up such as we have in this
country and as a major benefit in
the success of later life. “We Amer-
icans have a question before us,
whether we can train our children
physically in education or must re-
vert to compulsory training like
Germany,” he pointed.out.

Adele Yorio, Ed41, representing

the students, paid tribute to the.
— the football team and stated that

the student body is the main part
of the mechanism of the University,
and the outstanding part of the stu-
dent body is the football team.

The next speaker introduced
was R. E. Sherrill, professor and
head of the oil and gas department
and chairman of the faculty com-
mittee on athletic policy. Said Pro-
fessor Sherrill, “Our ﬁrst interest
is in ‘education, but we realize that
football plays an important part
too.” ‘

Next speaker was Ted Konetsky,
D44, captain of the 1940 football
team, who thanked his fellow play-
ers for their cooperation during
the past season.

Coach Bowser complimented the
football squad as “one of the ﬁnest
groups of boys in the history of
Pitt football.” He reviewed the past
football season and stated as the
reason for not having a more suc-
cessful season that an inferiority
complex had been developed among
the Pitt players since he had over-
stressed the prowess of the succes-
sive opponents. .

The last speaker on the program,
Chancellor John G. Bowman, sum-

med up the major points of the pre-\.

ceding speakers.

Reindeer Buck into Panther

Issue, No Strings A ttaehed

Two reindeer named Donner and

-Pancer were waiting for an eleva-

tor on the eighth ﬂoor Friday.
“Look Donner,” said one rein-
deer, picking his teeth with a piece
of antler, “is it true that the
Panther will be out Wednesday
with a new and different cover and
a story entitled “Osculation Is an
Art?”
“Frankly,

Pancer,” replied the

reindeer with the buck teeth, ‘‘I ,
‘ don’t know.

Let’s go over to the
Panther office and ask Jack Stauif
whether the Panther will contain a
new feature in which three campus
personalities will be pictured and

A discussed.”

’A shot rang out in the corridor.
Both reindeer dropped to the floor,

‘ quipped Stauff.

then dashed like elk for the Panther
office.

“I have great moose for you,”
“The Panther will
feature a story. on Ted Konetsky
by Bill McElwain, spicy Christmas
cartoons by George Gregg and two
full pages of campus pix. Two
pages of Panther patter will be in-
cluded, plus a story authored by
Marsh Nesbitt, on the civilian pilots
training course in the engineering
school.”

‘‘That’s good stuff, Stauff,” said
Donner, chewing as fast as he cud
on a piece of tundra.

Just then a bell rang.

“Hurry,” cried Pancer,
sounds like Santa.
he has to sleigh.”

275 Enroll in UniVersity°s

Special Defense Course

Engineering P1°ogra1n Provides
Training for Industrial Demands

In cooperation with the U. S. ofﬁce of education’s program of de-
fense job training, the University has already enrolled 275 persons in
short engineering courses which are scheduled to begin January 6 and

run to the end of June.

One hundred more possible enrollers will be

interviewed by the School of Engineering today.
The University is conducting these non-credit, tuition free courses

along with Carnegie Tech and Penn

1 State extension in a coordinated ef-

fort to train men specifically for the
demands of industry in the national
defense program. Persons who may
apply for admission to these courses
include those with at least a high
school education, persons now
working in industry, and students.
Workers Sign Up

Of the number signed up for the
courses in the three schools most
enrollees are persons who are now
wo'rking“in industry. Many college
students are also signed up. Uni-
versity students who wish to enroll
must secure the permission of the
dean of their school.

The U. S. office of education, us-
ing the facilities of the University
School of Engineering, offers four
courses on campus: mechanical
drawing and descriptive geometry,
machine design, metallurgical in-
spection, and production planning
and control. Other shorter courses
will be offered later.

No Credit Given

J. S. Lambie, lecturer in civil en-
gineering and director of the Uni-
versity engineering defense train-
ing program, explains that the
courses are of college grade al-
thought no college credit will be
given.

“The man trained in these courses
will be on a sub-professional level,”
Mr. Lambie stated. The speciﬁc
training is being given for the ex-
pected tremendous growth of po-

Franklin Sees Log of Yuletide

Celebrations Because of War

“The Christmas spirit and Chris-

tian doctrine are basically in con-

ﬂict with the present war spirit,”
states Dr. S. P. Franklin, professor
of education and director of courses
in religious education. The good
will typical of the Christmas season
is lacking in the makeup of warring
nations, for its position is superseded
by deception and hatred, twin forces
of evil, Dr. Franklin stated.

Because of the emotional effects
of this season with its gifts, decora-
tions, and‘ mutual friendship, reli-
gious fervor reaches a climax, and
ordinarily is the cause of rejoicing
and widespread happiness. “This
year,” declared Dr. Franklin, “the
bitterness rampant throughout the
world will undoubtedly prevent the
beneﬁcent results of more peaceful
years.”

The deep signiﬁcance of this
Christmas spirit, however, cannot
be completely refuted, Dr. Frank-
lin believes, although its universal
recognition will be retarded. This
was the case in the Russo-Finnish
farce only one year ago, when sol-
diers of both sides sang carols and
exchanged gifts while diplomats
plotted. In the “comic opera” war
of Bolivia and Paraguay in 1934,
the heads of the opposing forces
called a temporary truce so that
soldiers might go home for Christ-
mas.

“There will be no abatement of
war this year, but the individual
soldiers will recall more peaceful
Christmas seasons when “Peace on

earth,‘ good will toward’ men” was
more than something inscribed on
a Christmas card,” Dr. Franklin ex-
plained. Their reminiscences will
provide them with a sort of “inner
celebration,” while they huddle in
muddy trenches.

As to peace proposals, Dr. Frank-
lin admits that there will be a few
half-hearted efforts to bring about
a lasting peace. He sees, however,
that circumstances will render any
such overtures entirely worthless,
since neither side has yet satisﬁed
its wishes.

SFA Wi.l.l Seek

Fare Reduction

Assembly Discusses
Rates, Me-.n’s Lounge

Reduction in street car rates for
commuting University students and
conversion of the eighth floor tuck

shop -into a lm‘en’s lounge are two’

possibilities that may result from
the Student—Faculty association
meeting, it was asserted today by
SFA members.

A motion to forma committee
which will conduct an investigation
for reduction of student street car
rates was proposed by I-Iiram Mil-
ton, C42, during the meeting Wed-
nesday, Milton was appointed
chairman and stated that he will
Contact all of the colleges in the
city to form similar groups.

Joint Committee

A joint committee composed of
students from all the city colleges
will ask the Pittsburgh Railways
company and the Pennsylvania
Public Utilities commission for re-
duced rates if the scheme is follow-
ed. The other members of the
committee were not chosen at the
meeting.

During a discussion of what will
become of the eighth ﬂoor tuck shop
when the new tuck shop is com-
pleted, a suggestion was made to
convert it into a men’s lounge.
Clemens Named

Hillard Kreimer, BA43, was

chosen chairman of a committee to .

investigate the tuck shop situation.
Members of the committee include
Edward Tait, C42, and Virginia
Halon, C41.

Julia Clemens, Ed41, was ap-
pointed social committee chairman,
Joseph Roberts, C41, president of
SFA, announced. Miss Clemens
will replace Jack Stauff, C42, who
resigned because of additional work
as newly appointed editor of the
Panther, campus humor magazine.

Alumni homecoming will be the
theme, announces Ben Foote, C42,
chairman of the pep committee this
year. During the consideration of
the Pep committee’s report, the
theme for next year’s assembly pro-

grams was decided.

Grogan VVEII Head
Statistics Group

Following the suggestion that a
survey be conducted to determine
the opinion of University students
on sending food, clothing, and
money to Europe, the executive
committee of SFA appointed
Thomas Grogan, BA42, chairman of
the SFA statistics committee at a
recent meeting. .

Grogan will succeed Hiram Mil-
ton, C42, who was forced to resign
because of an illness which kept
him out of school recently.

A suggestion that SFA sponsor
an ambulance in Great Britain to
aid in rescue work there was also
discussed by the group.

Chancellor to Answer

Questions of Students
Special Quiz Arranged for SFA

Assembly in Soldiers’ Memorial  

Student-submitted questions will be answered publicly by Chan-
cellor John G. Bowman during an address at a Student-Faculty as-
sociation. assembly expected to take place in Soldiers’ and Sailors’
inemorial hall the fourth hour Friday, January 10. This is the first
time for such a gathering at the University.

Questions must be turned in
December 27, and may concern

iproblems of University adminis-

tration and student-faculty rela-
tionships, Joseph Roberts, C41,

. president of SFA, announced today.

“Questions must be submitted to
the dean of men’s ofﬁce before that
(December 27) date,” declared
Roberts, “for the executive com-

‘mittee must have time for careful

choice and consideration of the
questions and to give Chancellor

- Bowman ample time to prepare his

address.”
Committee Sorts Questions

After the executive committee
chooses the most important ques-
tions, they will be submitted to
Dr. Bowman, who, in collaboration
with the committee, will pick the

I ﬁnal list that will be answered.

‘:>

Prior to the address, the Pitt News
will publish an outline of the speech,
revealing the topics of discussion.

The fourth hour will be omitted
if such proposal passes the Board
of Deans, which will meet Jan-
uary 6.

At an executive committee meet-
ing which took place during the
week preceding Wednesday’s SFA
meeting, the possibility of the as-
sembly was discussed with Dr.
Bowman. A resolution passed by
the SFA during the meeting‘ Wed-
nesday supported the assembly.
First Such Assembly '

The idea of having Dr. Bowman
answer questions of interest to stu-
dents and submitted by students
originated at an executive commit-
tee meeting when the Chancellor
answered some questions on Uni-
versity administration. Members
of the committee asked the Chan-
cellor if he would answer similar
questions at an SFA assembly, and
he agreed to.

No occasion in the past has in-
voked such an assembly, Roberts
asserted, although many questions
have been asked of the Chancellor
during private interviews.

Foster Hall Assembly
Hears Press Analyst

When Pi Tau Phi, honorary
scholastic fraternity of the Col-
lege, presents its open meet-
ing tomorrow evening in Fos-
ter Memorial auditorium, on

the platform will be one of
those world-gad-abouters, one of
those glamorous foreign cor-
respondents, one of those people
who knows people-—not three per-
sons, but one man—-Guy V. Miller,
foreign editor of the Pittsburgh
Press.

Meeting Open to All

Pi Tau Phi will present Miller
as an expert on foreign affairs,
speaking on the topic, “America in

Millerjs experience in world-
travel, as a foreign correspondent
on four continents, and his ac-
quaintance with contemporary
world ﬁgures makes him well qual-
iﬁed for his position as a foreign
affairs analyst.

Travel Experience

His travel experience dates
from his high school days when he
cruised off to see the world as a
cabin boy and seaman. He’s been
here and there ever since, always
in some way connected with the
business of newsgathering. In 1929
he was a correspondent in South

Dr. Silverman Discusses Class
For Chemical Society Lecture

Dr. Alexander Silverman, profes-
sor and head of the chemistry de-
partment, discussed the past and
predicted the future of glass in
his lecture on “Glass: Today and
Tomorrow” at Carnegie Music hall
last week. The lecture was part of
the inaugural program of an an-
nual lecture series sponsored by
the American Chemical society.

Aided by exhibits of the Town
of Tomorrow from the New York
World’s fair, numerous scientiﬁc
organizations and‘ glass manufac-
turers, and his own collection of
picture; slides, Dr. Silverman re-
viewed the latest developments in
the glass industry, and showed what
might be expected of glass in the
future.

A bed, dressing table with hand
mirror, comb, and brush, a chair
and setee, drapes and a bed spread,
all of glass, were part of the bed-
room brought here from the Glass
House of Tomorrow from the New
York World’s Fair Glass Center.

A glass plate, capable of with-
standing enormous changes in tem-
perature without cracking, was dem-
onstrated by placing it on a cake
of ice and heating it with an oxy-
acetylene torch.‘

Dr. Harvey B. Gaul preceded the
lecture with an organ recital, which
included two of his original com-
positions, “Glass Beads” and “The
Legend of Glass: A Rhapsody for
Organ.”

Our Questions

AS EACH INTERNATIONAL event breaks
into print, we ask “What does this mean to
America?” A day by day classiﬁcation into the
favorable or unfavorable column is difficult; as-
signing a relative importance to each develop-
ment is even more difficult.

We would like to read into each story an im-
provement in British position; we exaggerate
English victories and discount German claims.
Wishful thinking, however, never won wars and
wishful thinking may undermine America de-
fense.

In an attempt to view the world situation ob-
jectively, Pi Tau Phi brings to the campus Guy
V. Miller, foreign editor of the Pittsburgh Press,
as an expert in the ﬁeld.

Mr. Miller’s topic, “America in a Changing
World,” will be of interest to everyone who
tries to maintain a clear, open mind in the midst
of propagandizing inﬂuences.

' He speaks tomorrow evening at 8:15 in
Stephen Foster memorial.

The Struggling A1°tist
In a Changing World

WE SEE BY the papers that a 22 year old
Temple University boy is being tried by author-
ities for conscientious objection to the conscrip-
tion bill.

We see by the same papers that this same
boy once won a considerable sum of money for
an essay he wrote on what America meant to
him.

Inevitably one is led to the conclusion that
when in Rome one must not only do as the R0-
mans do; he must do as the Romans are doing
on that certain day. Society is getting dyn-
amicer and dynamicer every day.

Guest Editorial.
The Vogue Society

. Now in 1940, Ralph Ingersoll writes an edi-
torial in PM, and he says the society is rotten and soft
at the top and getting giddy from looking at half tone
cuts of costume jewelry in Vogue. He says that this
is . . . no time for laughter or luxury .

Why do we kid ourselves that we can stamp out
all that Vogue stands for——orchid and painted toenail
rand limousine and Paris importation? Why can’t we be
honest enough to realize that the reason every revo-
lution, of demo<:.r.acy or nihilism. ever took place was be-
cause deep in their untouchable souls men and women
‘thought that aft.erw'ai*ds more people l:ike themselves
‘woul_d have a better chance for orchid and painted toe-
nail and limousine and Paris importation? .

We kid ourselves because it is easier and less dis-
'l‘.ll“l3ll“.~_.‘-f,‘ to talk about fascism versus democracy.
As  as we talk in labels and say that Beelzebub in
’Berlin.  threaten.ing our way of life, then if he falls
and fascism can’t be used as a demon any more. we
can go ahead and scmasti everything that little guys
‘thought they were ﬁghting for .

We’ve got more than just a job of building the world
for our ch.ild1"en by sweating and bleeding and build-
ing naval bases to stop Hitler with. If we go blithely
ahead with only that, we will be forgetting a lot of
‘things such as the fact that somebody named Jones,
earning 4.0 cents an hour, will want to help England
stop Hitler because he believes that Hitler in some way
would interfere with the process of keeping up
mortgage payments and buying a washing machine on
time payments. If forces that call themselves demo-
cratic do the interfering, he will not be likely to want
to defend those forces against Hitler.

We don’t have to get grim and determined and wave
our arms about the great and good William Allen
‘White committee. You can still laugh when you’re
grim and determined, but you forget how to laugh at
yourself, and that is bad. We might be a little less
‘pretentious and aphoristic and frantic. We might
go back and remember that rottenness is still with us
and everywhere, that the equal rights are little more
than a will-o—the-wisp to a lot of small-time Amer-
icans. We might try to clean up the plague spots as
they show themselves, without forgetting that it doesn’t
do any good just to religiously renounce the Vogue so-
ciety, and then let it pop up again when the air has
cleared. It is best to remember that what most of the
people want is a real equal shot at something like a
Vogue society, made more readily accessible. All the
grimness and determination will turn into so much
soft soap unless we can keep calm enough to prevent
the words alone from becoming so ﬁercely important

that people who like to buy di.me store jewelry and
pop-corn at baseball games are negelected in the rush.

We think Ralph Ingersoll meant all this, even

though he didn’t say it all. It seems as though it all is
worth saying.

Down the River

Bob Hamilton

Rare is the Pittsburgher who knows that the life
centering around the grimy little steamboats on our
rivers, extending along the banks of the Ohio and
Mississippi rivers and their tributaries from Pitts-
burgh to N’Awlins, makes up one of the last of the
colorful and romantic frontiers of America.

Down through the mountains and the lowlands,
especially in the southern parts of the river, runs a
wilderness of swamp and hill-land that shelters a host
of rugged indiviclualists, alligators, and mosquitoes.
Moonshiners and escaped roadgang convicts hide out
in the moss hung bayous, shooting revenuers and sing-
ing ballads with equal fervor, with stage music by the
booming bittern and roaring bull alligators. Strange
scenes are enacted up the Atchafalaya, the Red River
of the North, and the other tributaries with the names
of romance where the showboat still steams along,
bringing pathos and bathos into barren lives.

Tobacco Road

How do I know this, you ask? Thusly. I was
peacefully ﬁshing on a West Virginia river bank, catch-
ing big ones too, when a little old man with a big new
chaw came along and woke me up. He spat into the
river, discoloring it for some yards around, and be-
gan a eulogistic account of the river life, apparently
inspired by the sight of a big paddlewheeler coming
around the bend, waves triangling out behind.

“Look at ’er,” he said, “Ain’t that a purty sight?”
He shook his head despondently. “Ain’t many like her
left now’days.” He spat gloomily into the river again.
“Here I set on the bank, with nary a boat to take me
on, me and the other men that helped chart ever’ sand
bank in that crawlin’ creepy, snaky mess 0’ water, jes’
cause we’re old.” He looked gloomy, but brightened
up as the pilot of the steamer saluted him with three
hoarse whistles.

Show Boat

“That’s the life,” he said. “That’s the life for a
likely young feller, with any red blood.” He looked
me over speculatively. “It’s real luxurious now’days,
too.” He launched into a glowing description of the
food, the wages, the hours, and wound up, “Yep it’s a
real soft life. Why on some boats they change the
sheets as often as once a week sometimes.”

That got me. I gave in to the siren call and joined
up as a deckhand on the nearest boat. (Later I learned
that old man was a tout for a company that needed
young fools to do hard work for almost nothing.)

I stuck with the clean sheets for about three years,
then a horrifying incident brought my career to a
close. It happened on a lonely little back tributary
where the wild inhabitants were the subjects of many
a fearsome tale. I had toiled half a mile to a lonely
house to buy supplies, and found a ramshackle shack
full of slatternly women and men with beards. It
was local custom for a “furriner” to explain himself
ﬁrst, then ask the people’s names. And if he got it
he knew he could transact further business. If he
di.dn’t get it, he had better leave quickly and quietly.

Pigs Is Pigs

Well, I went through the prelims, then asked,
“What’s your name?” Three of the biggest and hairiest
men stepped forward, to the detriment of my taut
nerves (three snapped), and grunted like pigs! I ﬂed
quit the river, and took up raising peonies. Alas!
’Twas all unnecessary. The other day I found myself
strong enough for the first time to recount the tale,
to a friend who knew the country. He slapped his
knee and laughed until he wept. “Bob,” he said, “That
family’s name is Woink.”

One-Way Bias

Thoughts while drooling: why doesn’t some clever
person organize a chauifeuring service for those stu-
dents who drink on dates and would like to keep body,
soul, and Chevvy together? .

Signs of the times: dozens of old grads at the alumni
homecoming a while back kept dashing into the News
office, asking for copies of the Pitt Weekly, which Went
out with Hoover .

Observations: the one o’clock rush in the Tuck shop
is caused by the thousands upon thousands of ingenious
luncheoneers who stay back to avoid the twelve-thirty
jam . . Chancellor Bowman, after appearing at the
Italian room opening on Wednesday, spoke at Friday’s
football banquet and made mention of Plato. Socrates,
and Pericles, all Greeks . one must be interna-
tionale, at any cost .

One of the more erudite English professors in our
school was commenting the other day on the passing of
the great age of hero worship . . seems that all of us
are self-sufficient and would rather talk about our-
selves . . it’s getting so people don’t even believe
in Superman anymore .

Pitt beat Tech, Tech beat Franklin and Marshall,
F&M beat Dartmouth, Dartmouth beat Cornell, Cornell
beat Ohio State . . all of which proves that vicarious
living does not a Rose Bowl make, nor comparative
scores a moral victory . .

Add mathematical formulae: take any two num-
bers, subtract the smaller from the larger, then add the
original numbers, and multiply these originals by each
other . . . the three results, when added together, will
give you what you would have had if you had added
two to the smaller number and multiplied that by the
larger . . come up to the office, and we’ll give it to
you in x’s . .

Delightful suggestion to the Chamber of Commerce:
round up all the people who, in the past, have made
bets which were to be paid off under Kaufmann’s clock

. put them up in one large arena and charge ad-
mission to see them pay off their bets . . proceeds
could be used to build a super-highway between here
and Constantinople . . .

Pittpourrfs Pre-Vacation Tattlings Tell.
Of Bob vs. Maryland and Bill 123. Gurrils

By Dick Harman and M. J. Firth
Delt Bob Jones came back from
his fraternity’s conventions just
$7.50 lighter than he expected to
be. It seems that they have some

pretty fast motorcycles and some
touchy cops in Maryland, and one
of the touchy cops caught up with
Mr. Jones. He slapped a $17-50
ticket on Bob; but Bob wasn’t comp-
troller of the Panther for nothing.
Bob talked the nasty man into re-
ducing it ten dollass, and then con-
tinued meekly back to the smoky
city. Bob sat down and ﬁgured
that he has paid enough in ﬁnes to
have bought a new car. Bob doesn’t
drive too fast, he ﬂies too low . . .

Bill Lohmeyer has started 3.
“Stay away from the Girls” club,
installing himself as prexy. He’s
tried to enlist the entire frrosh foot-
ball team; but some of them just
won’t listen to reason. The massive
misogynist just won’t have noth-
ing to do with the weaker sex . . .

Notice: Light Co.

That gleam in Miss Betty—Jane
Wallace’s eyes comes from the fact
that Mr. David Farrelly, (pro-
nounced fairly), will hit town on
the twentieth of this month and
stay for a couple of weeks. The
gleam lights up the entire dean of
men’s office, saving the school no
end of electricity . .

he had just cut a girl’s insides out.
His listeners were horriﬁed Until
he explained that Erika Lutsch had
got stalled in the middle of dissect-

taken the poor little frog’s innards
out. His lab mates wish that he
would be a little more explicit in
the future . . .

John Syka is sporting a beauti-
ful pair of bags under his eyes.

Disturbance
Editor, the Pitt News:

The Spectator would like to pub-
licize his wager of six months ago:
namely, that the reelection of our
zealous national prexy would bring
us very close to a state of War. At
this time, it is my none-too-faulty
conception that we are tipsy-toeing
on the brink of disaster: disaster
in the form of a senseless national
brawl which can benefit us in no
way, unless one counts a depleted
population, a terriﬁc national debt,
and various and sundry depressions
as a beneﬁt.

It is most marvelous to relate
that we have been living in a state
of “National Emergency” for the
last ﬁve or six years. Now we are
about to confront a real emergency
——you l~:now—blood and goo and
sobbing women and hungry chil-
dren and crippled man—power.
These things, my friends, are due
to you and to you only.

EDITOR’S NOTE TO LOEB:

Who says the Owl will be published, any-
way? The so-called culprit who took your
pen didn’t remember where she acquired
it and was going to advertise for the
owner. Instead, she has ‘left it in my
custody and is still wondering where and
why she got it. I hope I remember to re-
turn it to you sometime. Good luck!

I LOST IT, I LOST IT——-

I won’t be able to go home during the
Christmas holidays unless the person who
found my brown wallet will return it to
me with the contents intact. It was lost
last Thursday in the Commons room near
the Fifth avenue entrance. Besides the
money in it, there were some things of
great sentimental value. You can collect
the reward by returning said wallet to
the Sammie house (Sigma Alpha Mu) or
to me in person.

Mr. Hitler, who wages war with his

England now suggests that we

willing to join hands with you once
the struggle is made inevitable by
your blundering egotistic attitude
of “Big brother in the whirled”
But, my friends, I think you’re
awfully stupid to be hoodwinked
into ﬁghting someone else’s battle
for no reason at all. Cheer up, my

.Pantl1erssPassers Depart

For   Midwest Tomorrow

Carlson Hopes Veteran Seniors
Unleash Potential Cage Power

Pitt’s Golden Panthers entrain
tomorrow afternoon for Madison,
Wisconsin and basketball points in
the Midwest and the Carlson squad
departs with the same potential
greatness as did the ill-fated 1939
“glamor boys.”

The senior ﬁve which romps out
against Wisconsin Wednesday
night has failed twice to play con-
sistent winning baskeball. This
year, with a starting lineup settled
from the opening of practice ses-
sions, and a determination born of
last chance hope, things should be
different.

The system has been changed
slightly, but judging from the
Panthers’ practice exhibitions, sig-
niﬁcantly. Instead of the wild pass-
ing which characterized many of last
year’s court battles, a more varia-
ble style of play has been devel-
oped which should eliminate the
Redskin spins into which the team
fell last year when the rigid system
they had been taught failed to get
results.

Opinions on the “Blooming Flow-

er” technique vary from “As rev- 1

olutionary as the ﬁgure “8” to “just
.a publicity stunt.” If Doctor Carl-
.son’s theory is sound, this is the
squad to prove it. On paper at

before the Christmas holidays, the
“undefeated fraternity hopefuls will
put out all they have in an effort
to retain their pure records.

Top team thus far in the frater-
nity ranks is the fast passing, sharp-
shooting Phi Kap quintet. Tomor-
row night at 8 o’clock on the floor
of the Pitt stadium the Phi Kaps
“take on the Pi Kappa Alpha team,
and should be odds on favorites to
go on their vacation with a still un-
beaten mark.

Undefeated Pi Lambda Phi meets
the once beaten Sigma Chi quin-
tet. This close game will start at
8 o’clock on the Trees gym ﬂoor.

Phi Gamma Delta, runnersup to
the champion Phi Kap team last
year, has a veteran team returning,
and should give a good account of
themselves. They have not played
‘thus far this season, and will re-
ceive their initial test tomorrow
night at 7 o’clock at the Trees gym
against the Phi Delta Theta com-
bination.

Sigma Alpha Mu will be out for
their second victory at the expense
of the Theta Chi team. Theta Chi
lost their ﬁrst contest to the Delts,
but will be at full strength for
this game. The game will start at
7 o’clock and will be played in the
Stadium.

WAA Volleyball

Semi-Finals Set

The semi-ﬁnal game in the WAA
volleyball tournament will take
place this afternoon at 4:30 o’clock
in the Cathedral gym.

Contesting teams are the seniors

and the sophomores, both of which
have lost one game, and have won
one. The winner of the fray will
play the freshman team in the

ﬁnals on Wednesday at 3:30 o’clock

least, the Panthers shape up as a
team too hot for most opponents to
handle.

Besides ’39 mainstays Mel Port
and Eddie Stralo.ski, the ﬁrst team
shows smart—passing George Koch-
eran, rugged Sam Milanovich, and
handsome Jimmy “Doll” Klein, who
looks like he may shake oﬁ hi$

steadiness and step up to full-time
winning ways along with the Panth-
er varsity.

Reports coming out of the Mid-
west indicate that the ice-cream
eaters have picked themselves a
tough dish to start the season with.
Ohio State, sparked by Captain Gil
Mickelson’s 14-point second half,
rallied from a ﬁrst half deﬁcit to
sweep West Virginia off the court,
And another well-balanced squad
has started to roll at Butler univer-
sity, where Captain Bob Deitz and
forward Wilbur Schumacher have
started their barrage on enemy
baskets.

But whether or not the Panthers
finish their western tour on the
winning side, Carlson will have
had a chance to see his squad under
ﬁre. That all-senior lineup won’t
be given a chance to slump for as
soon as the vete-rans begin to
crack, off the bench will come sev-
eral experienced subs.

By Alex Zelenski

Overtime battles and upsets com-
bined last Thursday night to make
the fraternity basketball debut one
of the most thrilling in its history.

Opening night games were not
just meetings of high geared fa-
vorites and their usually weak op-
ponents, but were between evenly
matched fraternity organizations.
The scheduling of games was made
by drawing slips of paper, and the
results of the games last Thursday
can only mean that the fraternity
brand of basketball is deﬁnitely
on the upgrade.

Pi Lams Surprise

Top game of the evening was
the Pi Lambda Phi-Pi Kappa Alpha
game on the Trees gym ﬂoor. The
Pi Lams, considered only another
team in the pre-season selections,
came out of their basketball medio-
crity by beating a highly favored
Pi Kappa Alpha ﬁve, 23-18, in an
overtime period.

Freshmen dominated the Pi Lam
squad as “Specs” Greenberg rang
up 17 points to top all scorers. The
score stood at 17-17 at the end of
the regulation time, but Greenberg
stood out like a shot in the dark as
he made three baskets to clinch the
game.

Ed Henry, PIKA forward, topped
his team’s scorers with six points.

Highlights on the Intrancural Basketball Front

Upsets, Overtimes Mark Opening Night Games
As Phi Kappa Triumphs, Theta Chi Loses to Delts

fraternity basketball game, helped

the PiKA cause considerably.

A startling upset was registerd
when the Delta Tau Delta—Theta
Chi result was recorded. Theta
Chi, regarded as the team to beat
this year, was completely outplayed
by an aroused Delta Tau Delta
team, 15-12.

At the halftime the score stood
at 9-7 in favor of the Theta Chi
team, but when the second half
rolled around the Delts made a suc-

cessful comeback to outscore tneir,

rivals.

Johnny Stahl and Belcher made
four points apiece to pace the Delt
sharpsnooters. For the losers, Vet-
ter took scoring honors with nine
points. Theta Chi played without
the service of their two top players,
Edgar Jones and Bill Fitchko, and
must be counted on to make a come-
back in their remaining games.
Crawford Stars .

Kappa Sigma made a name for
themselves last Thursday as they
nosed out a favored Phi Delta The-
ta quintet, 18-16. The Kappa Sigs
played on even kneel with the Phi
Delts until late in the game when
a ﬁeld goal pushed them ahead.

Kappa Sigma’s Crawford had
three ﬁeld goals and four fouls to
make more than half his team’s
points. “Robie” Robinson, jack-
rabbit forward of the Phi Delt team,

swimming team is continuing to
work out in an effort to round into
championship shape.

Swimming mentor Ben Grady
has announced that about six of the
Panther mermen will attend the
annual aquatic forum held at the
fort, which is only 24 miles from
Miami. Among those going are
the Wilde brothers, Gus and Ralph,
Marty Kramer, Vet)’ Shulnes) and
Bill McCafferty.

Last season in his ﬁrst year at
Pitt Grady turned out a champion-
ship squad. The Panther natators
captured the Eastern Collegiflte
swimming association title with
ease as they rolled up 60 D0int5-
Franklin & Marshall, who ﬁnished
second, had only 36 points.

However, from that chamPi01’1'
ship squad, Grady lost many stars
through graduation. Such names
as Milt and Hy Lederstein, Al.Bea-
con and Al Slobodian are missing
from this year’s roll call, and Grady
fears that they will be hard to re-
place. With cooperation on the
part of the squad he hopes '50 be
able to mold another championship
outﬁt and bring home another title.

Those going to Florida during
the holiday will spend about ten
days there, endeavoring to pick up
some valuable pointers that will
beneﬁt them in their ﬁght for the
Eastern crown.

nents, but showed enough to merit
them the stamp of the season s best.

Connell, All—WPIAL basketball
performer from Charleroi high,
netter 12 points to claim high
point position.

The clash between the Lambda
Chi Alpha and Sigma Chi teams was
to have been nothing more than a
bit of exercise for each, but the
results showed both teams to have
more power than anyone expected.

The Lambda Chi’s stopped a last
minute Sigma Chi rally to win, 24-

made 13 points, while John Glasson
made eight points for the Sigma
Chi team.

C42; William Klinkenstein, C42 ;

Music Library

  Gets New Records

The purchasing division of the
University music department an-
nounces the addition of another
group of records to the fourth floor

, library.

Stravinsky numbers in the library
are: “L’Histoire du Soldat,” “Fire
Bird,” “Le Sacre du Printemps,”
“Octet for Wind Instrument,” “Pe-
trouchka,” “Les Noces,” and “Sym-
phonie des Pasaumes.” —

Other numbers are: “Violin Con-
certo in D Major,” Prokofieﬁ;
“String Quartet Number One,” Pis-
ton; “The Planets,” Holst; “Piano
Pieces,” Krenek; and “Russian Mod-
ern Music,” Shostakovich.

A group of favorite Negro spir-
ituals, recorded by the Hampton In-
stitute quartet, is one of the more
modern groups received.

“The records will be released for
the listening rooms when properly
catalogued,” announces Theodore
Finney, associate professor of music
appreciation. A second set of re-
cordings is being ordered.

Twelfth Floor ‘Holds
Monthly Open House

Third in the series of monthly
open house parties on the twelfth
ﬂoor is scheduled today from 3 to
5 o’clock, announces Betty Toddie,
C41, chairman of the WSGA social
committee which is sponsoring the
events.

For the Christmas party the com-
mittee has planned an afternoon of
bridge and dancing for the eds and
coeds and promises plenty of punch
and cookies for refreshments.

If a pretty coed ﬂashes an unex-
pected smile at you on Wednesday,
or one of the campus’s better-known
Adonises gives you the wink, don’t
get excited.

It’s strictly business—for a cause.

Prominent leaders in campus ac-
tivities will don news vendors’
costumes Wednesday, and attempt
to better the record set by Univer-
sity students in previous old news-
boy day drives, in order to raise
funds for the Children’s hospital.

“Our goal has risen rapidly since
the $26 taken in four years ago
when the drive began on campus,
and this year we expect to raise
$150 as our contribution to the
crippled youngsters,” predicts Gene
Pyle, C41, co—chairman of_,the drive
together with Kal Kalwary, C41.

The newsboys and newsgirls for
the drive have enlisted the help of
eight woman students, who will be
stationed at various entrances to
the Cathedral.

Students will be given a chance to
contribute to the fund by purchas-
ing copies of a special issue of the
Pittsburgh Press.

“We are going to start with 1,500
copies and we hope to go back for
many more,” states Miss Pyle, “I
hope the students will contribute as
generously as they have in the
past so that the University collec-
tion will better previous Old News-
boy sales.”

The following are student sales-
men: Beth Hughes, C41; Margaret
Patterson, Ed42; Kitty Lou Haugh-
ton, C43; Mary pewis, C41; Nancy
Sundstrom, Ed-42; Adele Yorio,

Technical Journal
Uses Student Item

Robert Fisher, E41, a member of

the Panther staff, has written an ar-
ticle on “Opportunities for Chem-
ical Engineers in Fuel Technology”
which will appear in the technical
journal, “Chemical and Metallur-
gical Engineering.”

. A great deal of Fisher’s data. was

obtained from Dr. H. H. Rose, senior .

Cole fellow at Mellon institute. The
article will be run in the publica-
tion within the next few months.
For the same magazine Fisher
also covers developments in chem-
ical engineering at li/lellon institute.
Co—author of an article about the
School of Engineering which ap-
peared in a recent issue of the Pitt

ASCAP, BMI Controversy  
Removes Pitt Songs from./lir

The time may come when “Hail
to Pitt” will be barred from the
air.

When that time comes any song
under the banner of the American
Society of Authors, Publishers and
Composers, including more than
1,000 of America’s favorite campus
songs, will likewise be barred.

A monopoly on music over Am-
erica’s leading networks will pro-
hibit the playing of these songs
and of new and olcl—time favorites
after December 23, unless an
agreement between the ASCAP and
Broadcast Music Incorporated, has
been reached.

The ﬁrst and most noticeable ban
will be on New Year’s day at the
different bowl games when “Fight
Stanford Down the Field,” “tight
Vols, Fight,” “Men of Nebraska,”
and “Fight for Texas Christian”
and many others will be sidetrack-
ed from the audience’s receiver.

There is a possibility that spe-
cially-prepared and glass-enclosed
broadcasting booths may be set up
by the BMI interests to make cer-
tain that none of the gridiron or
victory songs under the ASCAP
license will be sent over any of
their stations.

The Pitt song and the eight Un-
dergraduate Cap and Gown songs
published during the past two years
by Thornton Allen, member of the
ASCAP, will be barred from the
air, as will old favorites like
“Sweet Adeline,” “St. Louis Blues,”
and “Indian Love Call.”

To be substituted for these col-
lege songs and other favorites un-
der the ASCAP caption will be
songs of “unestablished, mostly-
inexperienced newcomers who are
being plugged by BMI and German
and Italian music acquired through
a deal approved by the Nazi and
Fascist ministers of propaganda,”
states Mr. Allen.

Because of the desire of so-called

at the Hotel Schenley from 9 to 1
o’clock.

“broadcasting barons” who control
Columbia Broadcasting stations,
National Broadcasting stations and
the Mutual Broadcasting stations,
to completely dominate the ﬁeld,
there is imminent danger‘ that the
“music you love to hear”——you
won’t.

This boycott will not apply to «

local independent stations which
have an ASCAP license but it
“looks like bad luck for folks who
expect to do their dancing at home
on New Year’s eve, because you’ll.
take what BMI offers and like it
or else,” declared one of Pitts-
burgh‘s radio columnists.
