New legzldlatio/2 could reduce éirtb

Starter suspended
after second DUI .

Staff W/riter
With the price of birth con-
trol quintupled since 2005, Con-
gress passed legislation last week
that made affordable birth con-
trol available to women again.
After a drafting error in
the 2005
Act, birth control prices sky-
rocketed across the country
by as much. as 900 percent.

The error resulted when the‘

deﬁnition of eligibility’ for nomi-
nal drug pricing eliminated all
college health centers and safe-
ity—net providers, said Planned
Parenthood spokesman Tait Sye.

V Consequently, women have .
gone from paying an ‘average of

$5 to $10 per pack of birth con-
trol pills to $50 or more, he said.
The - passage of the new,

omnibus appropgriations

T control coata for Pitt .4tu3e/zta

marked a victory for Planned
Parenthood, a national advocacy
group. for reproductive health
care, which has been working
with Congress for nearly two
years to pass this legislation.

The House of Representa-
tives passed the new provision
two weeks before the Senate

overcame Republican opposition.

Last summer,‘ the Bush ad-
ministration released a state-
ment it opposed the pro-
visioniiiilito make birth control
more available, said Sye. Those
opposed to the act took it as a
signal__that the bill would never

. get past the White -House dur-

A recent grant to the Swanson

capstone senior design projects.

Part_ of the grant will be
used toward building a Power

“The lab will be a real showcase
for Eaton at Pitt,” said Reed, who
hopes it will provide the Eaton
mindset to his students‘—'— their
commitment to the engineering
industry and visionary leadership.

But Reed has a larger goal
in mind for the research com-
pleted at the Power Quality Lab.

“\X/e’ll actually be looking to

toward going after larger grant

Power engineering is a good
opportunity for students, because
the industry has an aging popula-

president of sales at Eaton and a
graduate of the Swanson School.

Almost half of the power engineering
workforce will be eligible for retirement in
the next ﬁve to 10 years, said Reed.

The relationship between Pitt and
Eaton has grown stronger, as Eaton at-
tracts more students to its co—op program
each year.

But it started the capstone projects that
kicked off conversations for this collabora-
tion at the Power Quality Lab three years ago.

It took nearly a year to formally
sign an agreement, but it was obvi-
ous almost from day one that this was a
great ﬁt for Eaton Corp., said Bucklew.

Eaton has been working in collabo-
ration with other universities, such as
Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina
State, said Bucklew, but nothing to the
extent of the collaboration with Pitt.

“When you look at what we’re do-
ing at Pitt with power, there is re-
ally no other school building up their
competency in this area,” said Reed.

Reed also said that. electric pow-
er engineering will be irnportant to
the Obama administrations plans.

“Pittsburgh as a region is posed
to lead a national revolution that

we need to embark on,” said Reed.

This revolution will _be based on
energy, he said, which will be the de-
ﬁning issue in coming decades.

Reed ﬁnds that his students are at-
tracted to the ﬁeld of electric power
engineering because it addresses prob-
lems posed by the global energy crisis.

“It’s exciting for them,” he said. “They’re I

going to go out and change the world.”
Although Eaton is headquartered

with CMU

in Cleveland, 50 percent of the com-
pany. is power engineering, which is
located in Pittsburgh, said Bucklew.

“University of Pittsburgh is the
school we have most actively recruit-
ed from,” said Bucklew of Baton.

Three of 200 graduates employed by
Eaton were selected to its leadership de-
velopment program, which allows partici-
pants to focus on a speciﬁc area through
rotating assignments. '

Pa. Voters have an

identity

For most people, presenting a
photo ID isn’t a big problem. Be-
tween driver’s licenses, passports and
student or government ID cards, it
seems like almost everyone has at
least one card, if not several cards,
with his name and picture on it

So the fact that a number of
groups, including the ACLU. and
the NAACP National Voter Fund,
are protesting a bill that would re-
quire voters to show a photo ID
every time they vote might at ﬁrst

seem strange. But it is a big depar— .

ture from current Pennsylvania law,
which only requires that a potential

‘ voter identify himself the ﬁrst time

he votes
Critics of the bill say that it would

I “infringe on the voting rights of
. Pennsylvanians  including elderly,

low—income, disabled and minority
citizens who often do not possess
these types of identiﬁcation.” And it
is true that some people can have a

I difﬁcult time acquiring government
. ID cards, most of which require ap-

plicants to provide both proof of

residence and proof of citizenshipi
So if a person didn’t have a copy

of his birth certiﬁcate or couldn’t

, provide some proof of residency, he
. could easily be barred from applying
I for government ID and thus barred

from  in elections. Consider-
ing the importance of the ideal of

, democracy in the United States, the i
Senate bill suddenly takes on a 
_ discriminatory tone.

But we have to consider in

achieve that end, it would be neces-
sary to make it a little bit more dif-
ficult to vote. After all, if the process
is made too easy, people looking to
cheat the system wouldn’t have any
_ difficulty doing just that

This bill has the same goals in 
mind that Allegheny County did 
when it audited the touchscreen vot— 
ing machines before the most recent 
presidential election. Itwas a security 
measure, and to that end it had to 
make sure that the machines and the 

process of using them were secure
The Pennsylvania Senate bill
would achieve the same  only
instead of auditing the machines
themselves, the bill could be thought
of as away to audit the voters. Every
- person presenting himself to vote
would have to present identiﬁcation,
and the- election officers on duty at

the polling place would examine the I

ID and  an afﬁdavitto say they’d
done it.

-This process may seem byzantine -

and overly complicated, especially
for people who have voted in the

sacriﬁce worth 

by Erik Hinton

I hate recycling. The whole or-
deal of searching for blue. bags,
green containers, special pick-up

 days and “glass only” bins.is little

more than a dog and pony show.
Recyclinghas all of the sacriﬁce
of modern rituals such as giving
blood or sponsoring poor, for-
eign children with none of the
life-saving. Recyclers are also pas-
sionately self-satisﬁed.

Now, I am not denying that

- recycling is better than_ stacking

our jars and pizza boxes-until our

landﬁlls becomes glittering, cor-

rugated monoliths. My objection
to recycling is that it gives a waste-
ful public a‘ gold star for making a
minor change in their habits.
Rather than taking steps to
more legitimately reduce his en-
vironmental impact, the average
American crams glass after glass

into his cerulean sacks and Waits ,

for the big truck to pick it up.
Pleased with his green habits, he
drives his car to the nearest Cost-
co warehouse and buys another
ﬂat of glass peanut butter jars. _

Blinded by the smug achieve-
ment of recycling,‘ we overlook

_far more effective. measures such

as the two “R”s that come before
“recycle” in the famous trinity,
“Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.” Recy-

cling is not a zero-sum enterprise,
but we convince ourselves that as
long as our Snapple bottle gets in
the right chute, we have done no
harm. In fact, we have. Recycling
takes energy, and there are few
products that can be reformed
into new goods in their entirety.
Fossil fuels power the cars that
take our bottles to the machine

that takes fossil fuels to sculpt‘
_ our bottles into new bottles that

 taken back to the store in
other cars that use fossil fuels.

With such an" arithmetic of
carbon footprints, it makes one
wonder why we haven’t gone
back to the rnilkman. Reﬁll my
bottle, please. Don’t make it into
a new one.

People need to learn to

reduce and reuse as Well

Hinton, page 10

Instead, we need to be shocked out of
our recycling contentment and start un4
dertaking real change. On a small scale,

o we should look to new consumption hab-

its such as reusing bottles to contain oils,
peanut butters, jellies, etc., contenting our-

selves with tap or ﬁltered water and, Nal- .

genes rather than running to’ the Dasani

machine or packing lunches in containers _

from home instead of buying a Styrofoam’-
swaddled pad Thai.

Recycling encourages just the oppo-
site. It’s ‘the diet soda effect; you convince
yourself that you are doing a favor to your

These things considered,'I have nothing

. Cantini created, however.

Cantini built his life out of art and donated multiple pieces to Pitt
along the way. . i ‘

Overthe spanofhis time atPitt, hewas 
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, who selected Cantini, a former Pitt
student, to go to ‘Ecuador with a few fellow students to assist in the
relief effort after an earthquake

Upon  to Pitt, Cantini conﬁded in Litchﬁeld that there
were rug factories’ in Ecuador that fascinated the young artist
Inspired by these and encouraged by Litchﬁeld, Cantini began to
makehis owndecorativerugs,whichhanginthelibrarytoday

As Iitchlield was somewhat of a mentor and inspirational guide
to Cantini, it affected the artist greatlywhen the chancellor was killed
in a plane crash. , '

“The fact that he was conscious that we needed art at the

University, I felt so strong about  it important,” 

Many of his art pieces on campuses are donated in  .

"The mural in Posvar is my favorite" piece of campus art,” said

Panthers still have work ,

to do before second round

by Jasmine Hawkins
Stzzﬁ’ W/riter

NCAA. Tournament bids made dreams
come true, but what does March Madness
look like for the Pitt wornerfs basketball
team? . _

Awarded the No. 4 seed, the lady Panthers
were placed in the Oklahoma City Region.
And with the exception of two teams, every
school Pitt could possibly face on the road to
the Elite Eight either ﬁnished first in a con-
ference, won a division title or both. .

Lacking a top—season_ ﬁnish and confer-

ence championship, the Panthers (23-7) ﬁn-
ished third in the Big East behind Louisville
and undefeated Connecticut.

However, according to coach Agnus Ber-
enato, a conference like the Big East is all the
preparation a team can ask‘ for.

Pitt has a good chance of making the
Sweet: Sixteen where, if all goes according
to plan, the Panthers will play No. 1—seeded
Oklahoma on the Sooners’ home court.

Before the Panthers make it to Oklahoma,

. however, they have to survive in Seattle.

The Panthers will face Big Sky champion

Bryan hoping to
lead Pitt toNCAAs

by Laura Veith ‘
Staﬂ WrL'ter

Before Pitt gymnast Dani Bryan takes

to the bars, she always tells herself, “Relax. I

Put your body where you want it and go.”
While it seems simple, this mantra has giv-
en her success through a difficult year.
This time last year, Bryan suffered one
of gymnastics worst inju-

than-second. As a junior, Bryan and senior

’ co—captain Alix Croop have led the Pan-

thers to a 7-6 record, with last week’s close
loss to Maryland being the last decision.
The Panthers will travel to.NC State for

, Saturday’s EAGL Championship, where a

strong performance is necessary to qualify

A for the NCAA Regionals -— a goal they

have been working for all

ries -— a torn achilles ten—. , 
don. The average person  
takes eight to 12 months
to recover, but Bryan took
only seven. .

Not only is she com-
peting again, but she is
also setting the standard in
the EAGL conference on
both the ﬂoor and vault.
Bryan_is currently ranked ,
second in the region on
vault and 23rd in the na-
tion. .

season.
“The loss to Maryland
makes the kids hungrier,”

said Yohman. “The goal’

is -to go in [to EAGL
Championship] and show
everyone else we are one
of those strong teams.”
As a freshman, Bryan
was the EAGL Cham-
pion on the vault, and
 she’s hoping to reclaim
that title this weekend.
Freshman Alicia Talucci

the Week Croop are also

events hinge on leg
strength, thus her domi- _
nant performances are all the more im-
pressive. Pitt coach Debbie Yohman said
that these two events are usually the hard-
est for a gymnast to return to after a leg
injury. V

This season, Bryan has taken first place
on the vault livetimes, ﬁnishing no worse

hoping to walk away with
titles of their own. ’ -
. Currently, the Panthers are ranked 38th,

-meaning a strong EAGL showing is their

only hope of making it to the NCAA Re-

, gionals, where only the top 36 compete.

“We need the meet of our lives at this
Championship,” said Yohman.

Montana at the University of \Washington’s l i A
-' Bank of America Arena on Saturday. The-.
Grizzlies earned an automatic NCAA bid by
winning the Big Sky championship in a 69-62

victory over Portland State.

Making its 18th NCAA Tournament ap-
- pearance, Montana enters the weekend with
_ no wins over any NCAA Tournarnent-bound
, team. Pitt, rrieanwhile, has ﬁve. The Panthers
also have six losses to ﬁve teams in the tour-
nament with a seeding of eight or higher.

If successful in  their destiny, the
Panthers will play the winner of the Xavier-
Gonzaga game in the second round of the
tournament; No. 5—seeded Xavier is expected
to defeat No. 12 Gonzaga, but March Mad-

ness is known to produce upsets.

Gonzaga enters the tournament as the
regular season and West Coast ‘Conference
champions. Gonzaga (26-6) won seven of
its last eight games and is making its second

Tournament appearance in three years.

Like Pitt, Xavier’s Musketeers (25-6) are
making their third straight trip to the Tourna-
ment by ﬁnishing ﬁrst in the Alantlic-10. ,

If seeding prevails, Pitt will defeat Mon-
tana, Xavier will crush Gonzaga, and the
Musketeers will meet the Panthers where their
tournament dance will come to a halt. The
Panthers will then hope to defy their No. 4
seed toupset the No.1 Sooners in Oklahoma,
and Pitt  proceed to the Elite Eight where

it could match-up against Auburn.

Unfortunately, only time will tell if the
Panthers have what it takes to live up to. their

No. 4 seed and beyond.

- Berenato  company are focused on
one game right now, and that will take place

Saturday at 6 p.m. against Montana.
