More Limits

' Police Continue
To Tag Heavily
Around Oakland

By NATHAN MARYN. \
T There is, a possibility of
more restricted parking on
‘Fifth Ave. near the Cathedral
in the future.

This information was re-
vealed by Pittsburgp Police
Inspector Thomas Martin of the
Traffic Division. He said that ‘he
didn’t think that the additional
restrictions were particularly
necessary, but that they had been
requested.

He added that if existing re-
strictions on parking in the area
were followed more closely, the

ed for more limited parking
spaces. ‘ _

Martin made his remarks in a

‘_ phone interview with the Pitt

News with regard to the current
increased traffic law enforcement
campaign. He said that the cam-
paign will continue until parkers
(including many’ Pitt students)
realize that they must obey posted
traffic and parking regulations.
With regard to the current
campaign, he said that 75 tags
were issued by the ﬁrst police
shift last Wednesday, the ﬁrst
day of the campaign.

Of these he noted that the lar-
gest number, 25, were given to
cars parked overtime at ‘parking
meters. Another large group was
violation of laws regarding en-
trances and driveways.

He said that he instructed his
men to be lenient around the Ca-

.thedral on the ﬁrst day of the
campaign. This was to allow stu-
dents to be reminded of the in-
creased enforcement through the
Pitt News last Wednesday.

This ﬁrst day leniency should
not be expected throughout the

THE POWER OF POSITIVE WRINKLING

While everybody knows that
the soft collar on Van Heusen
Century Shirts won't wrinkle,
ever, a Van Heusen survey
among college students has
revealed that precious few
know why. Here are some of
the responses:

J. L.—sophomore at the
Psyckody-namic Institute for
Arts, Crafts, and N umberPaint-
ing-“Obviously, the collar
won’t wrinkle, because it’s
afraid to wrinkle. It may have
been threatened by some surly
Van Heusen vice-president.
Ergo, it exhibits the Cavandish
anti-wrinkle syndrome.”

G. F.-——junior at Usury
School of Advertising—~“C o1lar-
wise, there’s no demand for
wrinkles. No customer beneﬁt.
Now, this is strictly oil‘ the
top of my cranium, but the
statement, ‘the soft collar that
won't wrinkle, ever,’ is too
negative. Substitute ‘never’ for
‘ever’ and you not only have

a positive statement———but—

as demonstrated by that a“

famous cigarette, this
ungrammatical concept will be
atten tion-getting.’ ’

L. V.——senior quarterback at
Jtfiltown College——“I wouldn’t
be without a Van Heusen.
Look here . . . under my pleat-
less shoulder pads. See?, Out
of simple decency, the collar
refrains from wrinkling. It’s

I this kind of restraint that

recently led to our glorious
victory over Birdbrain U. Not
a man was scathed. Huzzah for
the collar——and ﬁght furiously,
fellows.”

Yes, this is the kind of
ignorance we run across.
Actually, while other collars
are made of 3 pieces of mate-
rial, the secret of this soft collar
with its wrinkle-shunning
qualities is one—piece con-
struction. Van Heusen Cen- x
tury shirts come in 5 collar
styles. $4 and $5.

Two Hundred More

Jerry Klein and Ann Papieski,

semester.

Since its opening on March
17, 1,648 people have visited the
Music Room. The most popular
‘hours seem to be from 1 to 3

Over $1,000 has been spent in
the development of these facilities.
The high-ﬁdelity set has a pick-
up arm so sensitive that it will not
scratch a record when accidentally

‘slid across it.

Furniture Cleaned

Klein tells the story of how,
when the room first opened, he
went to an oliicial with a request
to have the “gold” furniture
cleaned. lndignantly, the ofﬁcial
explained that ‘the furniture had
just been cleaned and that it was
a mustard color, not gold.

Every Thursday night, jazz
sessions are held and are open
to all students. Currently the
Music Room Committee is try-
ing to obtain some collectors’
items in jazz.

those in the Music Room are not

ata will be .at Wildwood on Wednesday, while Westminster ,

will be met on Friday.

The Blue and Gold willtravel to West Virginia on Sat-
urday to round-out a busy week.

The J uniata Indians will present¢ '

a line-up of seven lettermen who
won eleven while losing only thre

Other Lettermen

Forming the core of Coach Ken
Bunn’s squad are the Barier twins
—Centerﬁelder Bill and Shortstop
Jim, and Don Ross, ‘a classy third
baseman who knocked in 20 runs
and hit .361 last season. All three
performers are only sophomores.

Other Indian lettermen are
Don Shover, Phil Over and Joe
Sopata. Shover will cover ﬁrst
base while Over and Sopata pa-
trol the outﬁeld. - '

Coach Bunn will rely on the
right arm of Pete McCauley who
posted a record of 6-2 with an
earned run average of 2.91. The
rest of the staff will be made up
of freshmen.

‘Westminster is the baseball sur-
prise of the district. The Titans
are undefeated to date, winning
seven games. Two of their vic-
tories came at the expense of the
Duquesne Dukes.

James Returns
The Titans are led by another
set of twins——-the Duvalls. Bill is
an inﬁelder while Bob is the main-
stay of the pitching staff. Both

are playing their fourth season on
the varsity. _
Other returnees include

George James, catcher, Jack
Pogue, ﬁrst baseman, Glenn
Smith and Don Wix, both out-
ﬁelders. '

The Panthers and Mountaineers
are no _strangers, since they have
already met this season. The
Jungle Cats ‘edged West Virginia
3-2 on a ninth inning single by
Pitcher Bill Hamilton. The blow
carried over 350 feet, but Hamil-
ton was credited only with a
single.

Hamilton’s mound adversary,
Bill Chuma, will be pitching for
the Mountaineers again. Chuma
has compiled a spectacular 1.23
earned run average while record-
ing a 5-2 slate.

Jim Dunlap, classy senior short-
stop from South Hills, is leading
the Panthers in all hitting depart-
ments. Dunlap sports a .421 aver-
age with eight runs batted in and

Hurricane And
Tigers Receive

Tourney Bid

Panther Athletic Director, Tom
Hamilton has announced that
Clemson‘ and Miami of Florida
have been invited to participate
in the Steel Bowl Tournament at
the Field House on December 12-
13.

Duquesne and Skyscraper U
will host the visiting teams on
the ﬁrst night. On Saturday eve-
ning, the winners will meet for
the championship and the losers
will battle for third place. Draw-
ings will be made sometime in
early November. '

The Steel Bowl began in 1951
and was won by Penn State.
The following year, the Panthers
and Dukes played Cornell and
Dartmouth in a round robin.
The Dukes won titles in 1953,
1955, and 1957 while George-
town and the Panthers won in
1954 and 1956.

Although last season’s Duke-
Jungle Cat game was a “heated
affair,” Hamilton sees no reason
to a round robbin. “A Panther-
Duquesne meeting is a natural, if
it happens. A relationship should
not be broken because of a little
flare-up,” said Hamilton.

Miami of Florida won its last 1

seven games and ﬁnished the
1957-58 year with an impressive
14-8, record. The Hurricanes are
led by Dick Berghoff, a 7’ center
from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
Clemson ﬁnished the campaign
with a 8-16 slate, but had a
young club. There is an excel-
lent chance that three .McKeesport
boys, George Krajack Walter
Gibbons, and Dutch Shample, will
be in the starting lineup. The
Tigers are coached by Press Mara-
vich, well-known to district fans.

¥ Linkers Await Mounties;
Strive To Regain Form

A week of practice is in store for the Panther golfers as
they strive to atone for two straight loses suffered at the
hands of Navy and Penn State. Previous to those two en-

counters, the men of Coach Bud Gaskill had won four. 
‘ straight.

The next match for the linksmen will be at Morgantown,

West Virginia, on May 19, when

, they meet West Virginia’s Moun-

taineers in a return engagement.
The Jungle Cats easily defeated
the Mounties 7-2 at Wildwood last

. month.

Improve Record
After the Morgantown encount-

' er, the Blue and Gold golfers will

return to Wildwood to close out
the season against their two in-
tra-city rivals,‘Carnegie Tech and
Duquesne. ,.
“I think that the boys should’
easily capture their ﬁnal three
matches against these tri-state
rivals,” commented Gaskill. It
abpears as though Gaskill’s pre-
dictions will come true since
the Panthers downed both city
rivals by 9-0 scores last’ year.
.Teeh blanked the Dukes 6-0 in
-a match several weeks ago.

Dav Brown
Lines—up a putt

Six'match statistics show two
juniors, Ben Avon’s Wade Hers-

Brentwood, leading theiseven man
squad with identical 5-1 records.
Hersperger’s loss occurred in the
heart-breaking 4-3 loss to Penn
State. O

Schwarzel, a state champion in
his senior year at Brentwood, suf-
fered his misfortune in the Navy
battle. It marked the first time

"that Schwarzel had lost a dual

The two senior members of the
Panther squad, Brentwood’s Dave
Brown and Captain Bill Rielly
from Sharon, both have 4-2 slates.
Reil1y’s losses came in the Navy
and 'State encounters, and Brown
met his match in the. Georgetown
and Navy tilts. I _

Bob Hixson, a junior from
Corry, has a 4-1-1 slate, and an-
other Junior, Bob White from
Jeannette, owns ~«a 3-3 chart.
The team's newest addition,
Sophomore Tom Treese of Holi-
daysburg, has had the misfor-

  
   

tune of losing the three matches
that he has played in.

The top three men of Gaskill’s
frosh squad, John Jamison, Har-
rold Glick, and Larry Haggerty,
have been unable to practice lately
on account of the poor weather
conditions.

Grid Opponents
Finish Practice;

TalentPlentiful

By LARRY HAGGERTY
While Coach John Michelosen’s

gridders" were concluding their ‘

annual spring drills with the in-
tra-squad game at Wildwood last
Saturday, their three tri-state
rivals,’ Penn State, West Virginia,
and , Syracuse, ~ were- also busy
practicing. .

Coach Ben Schwartzwalder is _

happy with the results of Spring
football practice at Syracuse Uni-
versity. The Orangemen wound
up their alloted twenty spring
sessions with a three hour scrim-
mage last Saturday.
. Team Set

“We think that we accomplished
a good deal during the workouts,”
Schwartzwalder declared. “The
boys hit awfully hard, moved the
ball exceptionally well, and show-
ed excellent spirit for only a
scrimmage.”

Looking forward to next ,.fall,
the Orange coach feels that his
starting team is just about set,
with the possible exception of
the end positions, where com-
petition has been particularly
keen.

The first team starters in Sat-

urday’s ﬁnal scrimmage were Ron
Bartlett and Gerry Skonieczki at
the ends, Larry Hershey and Ron
Luciano occupied the tackle slots,
the guards were Rog Davie and
Al Benecick, and Dave Applehof
at center.

Number one signal caller for the
Orangemen was last year’s top
man, Chuck Zimmerman. The
halfback slots were held down by
Tom Stephens and G e r h a r d
Schwedes while the fullback post.
was being manned by Ernie Jack-
son. .«
Tolley Stars

Four changes in position are be-
ing made on West Virginia’s 65-
man varsity football roster dur-
ing spring practice sessions, ac-
cording to Coach Art Lewis. The
Mountaineers also ended their
drills with an A alumni game at
Morgantown last Saturday.

Pete Tolley, a sophomore, has
been converted from fullback to
guard. A senior from Sewick-
ley, J. D. Miller, moves from
center to guard. Whitely Criss
switches from halfback to full-
back while Ricky Rodesky goes
from end to tackle.

The left guard slot, left vacant

by Joe Nicely, appears to be a‘

match between letterman Ed Soni-
mer and Carl Dannenberg, al-
though it is probable that both
players will make the ﬁrst team
