research

grant
received

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

Pitt's Center for Hazardous
Materials Research will be receiving
an additional $212,500 from the state
to develop a technical assistance pro-
gram and a research agenda to meet
the problem of hazardous materials
handling.

"The money is specifically for
research into hazardous waste han-
dling at Pitt. It is the first step in what
I hope will be a long term associa-‘
tion between the commonwealth and
the university,” said Senator D.

Michael Fisher at a press conference _

held yesterday. . .
In accepting the check, President

Posvar said, ”This is an important oc-

casion for the university. It is an in-

dex of progress in the high-tech world

we live in. .

’’It [the grant] shows ‘a new and
growing role of the university in
public service,” Posvar added. ”We
stand between the public and the
government in these issues.”

Posvar also said that the state in-
itiative is a drawing force for federal
monies into the region to support the
work of the center.

The grant will be used to help the
center build a core staff and begin an
applied research program to develop
technologies for reducing and recycl-
ing hazardous materials. The center
will also engage in education_pro-
grams and environmental policy
analysis.

Samuel Schulhof, president of
CHMR and former EPA administrator,
said, ”We.wi|| work to forge a part-
nership [between government and in-
dustry] to help solve . the
environmental probles we face. We
want to make Pennsylvania a"
showcase of responsible government
and private sector intervention.

"We will develop an assistance
program for small- and medium-sized
businesses that wouldn't be able to
afford an environmental service
department otherwise,” Schulhof
said. "We want to encourage other
universities to join the center.”

There are 12 funded projects cur-
rently underway at the center, in-
cluding waste minimization for
small-quantity generators, investiga-
tion of hazardous waste disposal and
hazardous waste management for
small businesses.

Also included in the ‘ projects
already operating is a training pro-
gram in conjunction with LRDC to
give environmental lawyers the
necessary education in the technical
aspects of their fields. ‘#___

One of the primary corferns of the
new center will be to assist small
businesses with their hazardous
waste management problems. The
center will serve primarily as a liason
between the private sector and the
government.

”What makes us unique  is that
we are considerably broader than
other centers,” Schulhof said. ”We
will try to focus the research of other
centers of expertise on the problems
we study.”

Police consolidation won't

affect coverage, officials say  

By Teresa Candori
Assistant News Editor

The consolidation of police stations
in Pittsburgh will not affect police
coverage in Oakland, according to
Michael McGee, administrative aide
to the chief of police.

Under the new plan, which has
been postponed, the nine districts
would be consolidated into five
zones, designated by the letters A
through E. .

’’It [the consolidation] won't affect
Oakland at all,” McGee said. ”All it
means is that when the officers report

‘for their tour of duty, they'll start at-

Squirrel Hill.” .
According to McGee, offices will

remain open at Oak__l__an_d’s Station No.

_4 at Semple and Louisa Streets.

”You'll also be getting coverage
from Station No. 2 on zone A,”
McGee said.

Station No. 2 is located on Centre
Avenue in the Hill District. -

Under the sector plan, which has
been ineffect for about 15 years,
police cars are strategically assigned
to patrol certain areas, so that it
should require no more than 15
minutes for a car to respond to acall
anywhere in its sector.

Under the consolidation plan,
these sectors will not change, accord-
ing to McGee.

”There’s no cause for alarm that
[Oakland] will be losing anything,”
McGee said. "You'll still be getting
the same coverage."

McGee said the decision to
Dostpone the consolidation was
made in order to make the move
more amicable among the depart-
ments involved.

”Basically, it was postponed to be
in concert with the rank and file [of
the police force] as well as manage-
ment,” McGee said.

The postponement was a joint
decision between Mayor Richard
Caliguiri, Fraternal Order of Police

President Pat Macnamara, Chief of

Police Wil|ian*rMoore, Deputy Direc-
tor Glenn Cannon and former Public
Safety Director John Norton.
McGee said the decision was not
related to Ca|iguiri’s firing of Norton
on Monday. ’'It was arranged before
any of the controversy emerged,”

.McGee said.

Pitt's Black Action Society has
charged that the University has
not made a strong enough effort
to retain its black students.

BAS Executive Assistant Donald
Frazier said, ’’It is a known fact
that if you're [a] black at the
University of Pittsburgh, you have
to possess exceptional athletic
ability to gain any type of atten-
tion or recognition. And those
with just a simple desire to obtain
a high degree of knowledge are
being ignored.” '

BAS has launched a letter cam-
paign to call attention to black
students’ financial problems. They

Student callsfor financial aid

plan to present these letters to the
board Qﬂtrustees at the Oct. 14
meeting.

”We hope to get financial aid
for this year's students and have
some committee established to
find a solution for next year,” said
Frazier.

Frazier said he expected more
than the 50 letters received to
date. However, he hopes the let-
ters’ content will make up for the
number of responses.

These 50 students require over
$70,000 in financial aid to con-
tinue their education at Pitt,
according to information Frazier
obtainedfrom the letters.

Frazier cites declining black
enrollment and retention as the

cause for the decrease in BAS
membership. Since last year, the
membership has declined from
476 to 362 members. According
to BAS, 22 of last year's members
have withdrawn from Pitt because
of‘ financial problems.

"Two members of our steering
committee didn't come back
because of financial reasons,” said
Frazier.

According to Frazier, Pitt is not
placing enough importance on
the financial aid problems of its
black students. _

"Right now, the most important
thing'is to retain students this
year." .

Officials from Pitt's financial aid
office were unavailable for
comment. '

Stud_ent  
making 
bid for S
Congress

By Eric S. Poole

Staff Writer

Phyllis Gray, the 14th Congres-.._}_:

’ sional District (Pittsburgh) candidate, _

for the Workers League, said she’ 
realizes it is nearly impossible for a 7.
third party candidate to win a general V.
election for Congress. , J

“I don't anticipate winning [the 2
election], not because the people
don't believe in what we have to say, ‘
but because we do not have the’
visibility of the major candidates,"
said Gray, who is running against in-

cumbent Democrat Philip Coyne. V j_ Ah

She went on to say that Alden Ved~'- ’ .
der, the Workers League candidate -in, T _
the 20th Congressional District (Mon — - 7
Valley) is facing the same visibility
problem against Democratic Con-
gressman Joe Gaydos. .

Gray and Vedder are running for
the U.S. Congress under the banner
of the Workers League, which is af-
filiated with the Young Socialists.

The stigma many Americans attach »
to socialism was a factor in the begin- [I
ning, according to Gray. ‘ ~' :’

_ ”At first, some of the steel workers." ,
we visited at the USX picket lines
were very hostile, but once theyr. ,_
heard what we were saying, theyg,
agreed with what we had to say.

"The current administration has
decided to roll back every reform
gained for the last 50 years, so that V ‘
they can pay for their war in Central
America," said Gray. '  

J Gray added that although she did ,
not expect to win the election, sheep P
feels that the true goal of her cam- "
paign is to facilitate the formation of - V i
a true workers’ labor party. '

"The AFL-CIO must take action on ' V
that [the formation of a workers’ labor ,'
party] before anything can happen,”
Gray said while pointing out thatall
of the major labor movements ’
throughout history have begun with ’
the trade unions. - T

But, Gray feels that even if the AFL- 
CIO does endorse the formation ‘of
a labor party, that may result in
violent opposition from the capitalist.
system. - .

”[The state police and the National
Guard] have the job of protecting the
private property of the capitalists 
Four people were killed protesting
the war in Cambodia [at Kent State . 
University in 1971] by the [Ohio] Na- if 
tional Guard to protect the property 
of the capitalists.” A

Gray paralleled the violence that
took place when the unions were .
formed with the violence which
would take place when labor
attempted to form a political party.

’’I don't advocate violence, but I do‘
feel that the workers have the right
to defend themselves," Gray said.

Gray and Vedder are two of seven
candidates running for public office
on the Workers’ League ticket. In
Michigan, Martin McLaughlin and
Alva Crivinsiare running for governor
and lieutenant governor, respec- .

. tively.

Warren Brust, one of the founders
of the Workers‘ League, is running for
the office of governor of'Minnesota,
and Cory Johnson is his running
mate. '

  
  

 

 
   

WASHINGTON — Ten close asso-

ciates of perennial presidential can--
' didate Lyndon H. LaRoucheJr. were

indicted yesterday on federal fraud
and conspiracy charges as law en-
forcement officials raided LaRouche’s
"headquarters in Virginia.

The Justice Department said
several of those indicted were
members of the ”inner circle” of ad-
visors to LaRouche, who is also the
target of a-_criminal investigation.

According to the 1 17-count indict-

ment, 10 individuals, two corpora-
tions and three campaign committees
tied to LaRouche were involved in a
scheme that raised more than $1
million through fraudulent credit card
billings.
' Investigators charge that the
scheme worked like this: LaRouche
followers, working mainly at airports,
get people to pay for magazine
subscriptions and other LaRouche-
controlled publications with credit
cards. Then the LaRouche followers
use the credit card numbers to make
thousands of unauthorized purchases
worth millions of dollars.

Investigators said nearly 1,000 peo-

ple have been billed for the
unauthorized charges to their credit
cards.

"Officials also said LaRouche
himself is being investigated in con-

Devastated Midwest
tries to dry out

OKLAHOMA CITY -— Sunny skies
and receding rivers let thousands of
flood victims in many midwestern
states return home Tuesday to begin
the long process of cleaning up.

Last week, severe weather dumped
more than two feet of rain on many
of the cities in the nation's heartland,
forcing thousands to evacuate their
homes.

Officials said nearly $300 million
worth of damage was done by the
flooding, and seven midwestern

Soviet chess star
to keep world crown

LENINGRAD —- Soviet chess sen-
sation Gari Kasparov has clinched his
match against fellow Soviet Anatoly
Karpov tor the World Chess Cham-
pionship. '

Kasparov, the current champion,

accepted a draw inthe 23rd game of _

the match on Monday, giving him a
12-11 advantage and assuring him of
the title. One game remains, but even
if Karpov wins, the match would be
tied at 12-12. The champion retains
the title in case of a tied match.

Earlier, Kasparov blew a three-
game lead and let Karpov draw even,
but Kasparov regained the lead after
a victory in the 22nd game.

Kasparov, 22, is the youngest
world champion in history. He cap-
tured the crown from Karpov last year
in a bitterly contested match.

Meeting designed  

to help students  
deal with their

By Jana Gordon
For the Pitt News

The first presentation of the Student
Connection Series, which featured
the financial aid department, was
held in the WPU Assembly Room on
Monday night. _ ‘

Paulga Davis, a representative from
the financial aid department, ex-
plained the functions of the depart-
mentand then answered questions
that students had pertaining to finan-
cial. aid.

Gary Starr, president of the Col-
Iegiate YMCA, said this is the first in
what he hopes will be a series of in-
formational presentations to be of-
fered to students.

Although the turnout at the first
meeting was small, Starr said that the

« Collegiate YMCA plans to hold more

programs with representatives from
different departments of the uni-
versity. -

”Students are always complaining
that they go to the departments, such
as financial aid, and aren’t getting
answers to their questions,” Starr
said. "That is the reason we decided
to put the Student Connection Series
together, so that students are able to
come and listen to the representative
of a particular department and get the
answers to their questions/’,

Paul Hanus, director of the Col-
legiate YMCA, said that 15 various
departments were contacted to come
andexplain their functions, but as of

problems at Pitt  

yet, only five have agreed to come.

”Besides financial aid, housing and
food service, College of General
Studies and Student Activities have
verbally'committed themselves to
come,” Hanus said.

Hanus also said that he hopes a
response will come from the Pitt
Athletic Department and the presi-
dent of the university.

”These departments, I feel, would
receive a lot of questions, so I hope
that in the near future they will res-
pond,” Hanus said.

The biggest problem now for the

Student Connection Series is.

publicity.

”Student government makes up a
real small percentage of our budget,
so therefore we are very’ limited,”
Hanus said. ”For the time being, we
can only spread the news by word of
mouth and the flyers and posters we
put up."’ ,

Because of the turnout, Hanus is
not sure when the next program will
be held.

”We have to re-evaluate to see if
we will go ahead with our next pro-
gram or wait until spring,’’ Hanus
said. ”Another of our problems is the
identity of the Collegiate YMCA.
Many of our activities are off campus,
and students aren't aware of the
things that we do.

”l’ve heard and been told that you 1

fail more often than you succeed, so
hopefully in the future we will suc-
' ceed in having a better turnout and
get this series off the ground," Hanus

No one’s going
to forget Norton

~ On Monday, Oct. 6, Public Safety Directorjohn Norton was fired
by the same man who hired him I5 months ago, Mayor Richard
Caliguiri.

Norton received his walking papers amid accusations of abusing
his authority and of unethical practices while in office. A glaring ex-
ample of such abuse arose when he authorized" an investigation of
a reputable, legitimate moving company because of a personal gripe
he had against them. Norton claimed that they overcharged him when
he moved to Pittsburgh. As if that weren't enough, he ordered an
investigation of City Controller Tom Flaherty for involvement with
cocaine. Flaherty and Norton had always antagonized one another,
and the cocaine investigation was obviously an attempt to discredit
his chief adversary. ‘

Combined with the two aforementioned examples, Norton alleged-
ly charged thousands of dollars to both the city of Pittsburgh and the
International Association of Chiefs of Police (a group of which he

was president) for ”official trips” he'd made while in office. Here‘

we have the perfect recipe for the perfect corrupt city official.

Political corruption is nothing new. Neither is the fact that fellow .

officials will cover up their colleagues’ abuse of power.
Norton began his investigation of Flaherty’s alleged cocaine involve-
ment five months ago, and not a word was said to the press.

The Pitt News applauds Mayor Caliguiri’s move to fire Norton. It
was overdue, but at least it was done. We also hope that the city
uses more discretion when they decide on Norton's permanent
replacement. Best of luck to Glenn Cannon, the interim public safe-
ty director. . _ ~

The appointment of John Norton was a mistake. Let's hope that
the same mistake isn't made again. '

Pittsburgh Pol ice

 won’t desert Pitt

It's official. South Oakland will not lose Police Station No. 4 -
for now. ‘

The Pittsburgh Police were slated to undergo re-zoning Monday.
That re-zoning would have moved the police station in South Oakland
to Squirrel Hill. But, according to Pittsburgh Police Chief William
Moore, the re-zoning will be postponed indefinitely. However, that
does not mean that it will not happen eventually. The Fraternal Order
of Police and the Bureau of Police are currently working on a plan
that would simplify the transition — which means that someday,
Oakland could lose its police station.

But in the meantime, our police are still here — serving and pro-
tecting. Though no one is sure how much longer that will last.

It's not clear whether public outcry against the plan or the recent

dismissal of Public Safety Directorjohn Norton is the reason for the

postponement. Perhaps police officials realized that the current plan
for re-zoning is foolish and wouldn't admit it. Who knows?

. The idea to allow more officers to patrol and answer calls from a
larger area is a good one. The part about moving whole stations is
where the faulty logic lies. With any luck the added time to simplify
re-zoning will bring about the changes the residents of Pittsburgh
want. Namely, increased police protection without the loss of their
neighborhood police stations. Why aren't city officials listening to
their constituents? Afterall, we are the ones who put them in their
positions in the first place.

The Pitt News is confident that the current shake—up in the Office
of Public Safety will not stop with the replacement of it's director.
City officials must reconsider the police station re-zoning plan and
recognize that it is nonefficient and inequitable in its current state
— especially in the higher-crime areas. Oakland is fairly high on that

list. We've got problems with the crime rates in our section of the -

city. How can we halt and eventually rectify the situation if our own
police station isn't here to help the residents of Oakland?

Protesters . misdirected  

I see we had yet another demon-
stration against apartheid last Sunday,
the latest ”protest” in the ever-
fashionable crusade against racial in-

I justice. I wonder if any of these

”humanitarians” ever wondered why
the Reagan administration or Mr.
Posvar and the trustees are against
divestiture? Maybe because it would
do more harm than good!
Complete divestiture of Pitt's
relatively meager holdings would
mean next to nothing to South Africa
and only hurt the university. As for
the United States, adopting complete
sanctions would only hurt both
economies and drive down the stan-
dard of living in South Africa. Who
would that hurt? The white govern-
ment official or the poor black
worker? -
Governments cannot change over-
night (except in Certain South
American countries) without quite a
bit of turmoil and bloodshed. The
Emancipation‘ Proclamation was
enacted in 1865 but the Civil Rights
Act wasn't passed until 1964. It took
the United States nearly a‘hundred
years just to make up the discrepan-
cy in the law! We are still hammer-

ing out the social and economic ‘

injustices in our society. Look at the
average wage-earnings of a black
man or a Hispanic compared to that
of a white. Look at the arrest of a man
belonging to the Aryan Nations in
Idaho. Look at the cross-burning at
Montour High School this past
weekend.

It's taken us a bloody civil war
(over 100,000 casualitiesl), race riots
and over a century of adjustment to
even consider racial equality. Yet
people are outraged; disgusted and
want to impose slap-on~the-wrist
”sanctions” because a country can-
not accomplish in a week what took
us over a century and tens of
thousands of lives!

If anyone is to be angry and out-
raged it should be the South African
government and rightly so! In fact, if
any of the ”sanctions freaks” out
there bothered to watch CNN this
summer, Mr. Botha gave a very upset
speech to the world reminding
everyone that they are doing their
best, but that they must move slow-
ly so as not to cause any more civil
unrest and loss of life than absolute-
ly necessary. A very noble sentiment.

I think that if anyone would want
to fight racial, social, religious or
political injustice, there are many
more suitable places to picket than
South Africa. How about Northern
Ireland? Or Afghanistan? Or Jews in

D the Soviet_ Union? Or Poland? Or Iran

and Iraq? Or the forced starvation of

LETTER

people in Soviet-backed Ethiopia? Or
the massacre of former members of
the South Vietnamese army and
government by North Vietnam?

I don't think these protesters have

anything worthwhile to say, and.

[they] do a lot to promote civil unrest.
They should be banned from march-
ing on the campus because they are
contrary to public interest and are not
indicative of popular sentiment. In
short, they are rabble-rousers.

If these people were really con-
cerned about stopping racial violence
and prejudice, they should have been
picketing Louis Farrakhan rather than
'P.W. Botha.

SGB inactivity

Having served as- a council
member on the CGS Student Govern-
ment, I take note when things of
significance take place in student
government. At watching the latest‘
SGB council, I have begun_to let out
a loud yawn. I am afraid the situation
has deteriorated so much that when,
one monthago, I offered my services
in any capacity, there vvas no answer.
Was there nothing to do? Were they
so well organized that everything was
done, or possibly so disorganized
that they didn't know what needed
to be done? .

I [wish] all of the luck to Jim Mum-
ma with his organization. Perhaps
SGB will receive some helpful feed-
back from our beloved Student Ac-
tivities. They are in fact supposed to
oversee SGB’s,activities. Or are they,

-- too, part of the slumber party on the

sixth floor of the William Pitt Union?

Students, SGB is our collective-

representative. And, it is our respon-
sibility to see that we are represented

- properly. If you care about any of the ~

issues that affect you as a Pitt student,
inform SGB about [it] and proceed to
solve it. Do you care about being run
over by a PAT bus? Commuters, do
you care about the last paycheck that
went to pay for gasoline, parking fees
and parking tickets? For you book-
worms, why is there no place to
study after midnight? And if you're
out late, do you feel safe on the
streets of Oakland? Well, I did, until
I got beat up one night. And how
about you freshmen who did not get
university housing, and those of you
who have to contend with the crowd-
ed conditions that should not reoc-
curyearly in the Towers complex,

why? If any of these issues bother
you, or [if there's] an issue that I've
missed, help SGB with it. Be part of
the solution, not the problem.

Traumatic coaches

As I was walking through Schenley
Park Wednesday with my 8-year-old
daughter, I witnessed something that
I almost couldn't believe. There I was
walking amidst the gloom and drear-
mess that the rain left behind, and I
saw what appeared to be ,a coach
screaming at an athlete. (I later found
out that it was Pitt's track team that
was running in the park that day). I
couldn't believe what my eyes and‘
ears were attempting to communicate
to _my brain. There was this athlete
standing in front of a man who was
screaming out profanities, calling him
names and sticking his hands towards
the athlete's face. It got to the point
where other people had to stand be-
tween the two, in order to halt the
possibility of something more serious
taking place.

I may just be an unemployed jour-

nalist, but I ‘have my own ideas of ‘

what's good for our community. Ob-
viously, this is not. I also mustadmit
that I don't even know why this was
happening, maybe the athlete did
need [to be] reprimanded, but I'm
sure it. could have been solved
without such a public display of pro-
fanity. Is this the type of man we want
to teach our children how to run, hit,
catch passes or shoot the ball through
the hoop. Well, I most certainly
don't. I always thought that college
athletics were supposed to be fun and
taught kids honor and discipline.
Student-athletes haveenough pres-
sures and tensions trying to juggle
athletics, while still keeping up with
their studies without having to worry
when the next time is when the
coach will freak out. I also under-
stand that college coaches are under
a lot of pressures to win games and
have their teams do well, but I don't
feel thatthe athletes should be the
outlets of such pressures. College
coaches should be professional

enough to remain in control and to

keep calm in dealing with their
athletes.

I sincerely hope that the athlete in-
volved went to the person in charge
of athletics at Pitt and told his story.
If not, then I hope that somebody
with the proper authority will speak
up to make sure that this behavior
won't happen again.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 8, I986

 

Point: we must divest from South Africa,

We cannot know at this point  

”We really need to be on the right

side of history.”
Senator Richard Lugar
Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations
Committee

, The fact of the matter is that most
of us don't understand what is going
on in South Africa. Most of the peo-
ple I talk to don't even know what
apartheid is, let alone the meaning of
divestment.

Apartheid literally means ”apart-
ness.” It is the separation of blacks,
coloreds and Indians from the whites
in South Africa. The separation was
not a bipartisan decision. It is the
forced domination of one race over
another. It is repressive, feudal and,
in the end, violent.

Divestment is the withdrawal of '

money invested, in businesses and
corporations based outside of the
country, that is ‘contributing to_the
economy of South Africa.

The University of Pittsburgh has
money invested in such companies,
and the rage of late has been to get
the university money out of the
system.

The argument has been that in pull-
ing university money out of’ the
businesses‘ involved, we are taking
away our own ability to influence
those businesses. It is said, if we pull
our money out, nothing will change.

The argument for divestment is a
simple, moral one. By pulling our
money out, we are saying that apart-
heid is wrong. We should not ask for
a particular time frame in which
apartheid must end. Those decisions
must be left to the government and
the governed.

By divesting we will be saying that
we want no part of apartheid and the
anger and fear on which it feeds.

The conflict in the divestment issue
is between economics and what is
morally correct.

Those who are for divestment
might say apartheid is feeding on the
money we have invested. But the
ultimate source that feeds apartheid
is the fear that created it — fear of
non-whites holding land that would
be bountiful; and fear of blacks and
coloreds governing the land that
European explorers had found during
the time of colonies and monarchies.

KAUFMAN

The fear now is of what will hap-
pen should apartheid end. Won't the
communists take over?'Won't vio-
lence among the natives of South
Africa keep the nation foreverin tur-
moil? If the current government
doesn't remain in power, who will
take over?

All of these are important ques-
tions, but we are letting our fears get
in the way of finding the answers.

What is so wrong with letting South
Africa find its own future? Why can't
we just get our money out of the
businesses that choose to stay there
and let them decide if they will con-
tinue to stay?

It is a fear of what will happen if
we are not involved.

There is also the possibility of I05-
ing money.

If Pitt should pull its money out of
these businesses, what would be
done with it? Ultimately, this univer-
sity must make a profit, or at least

Counterpoint: divestment

It's the principle of the thing. That
seems to be the best argument for
total divestment at Pitt.

If Pitt divests all university funds
from companies doing business in
South Africa, this will have very lit-
tle or no effect on the oppressed
peoples of that country.

Then what will total divestment ac-
complish? The University of Pitts-
burgh would be making a moral
statement. We would be saying ”no"
to apartheid. But will Pitt's divest-
ment help to weaken apartheid?

First of all, Pitt's total divestment
from companies doing business in
South Africa-won't compell those
companies pull their assets out of that
country. It won't hurt the companies,
because even though Pitt is selling
their stock, someone else is obviously
buying it.

Besides, West Germany and Great
Britain are much more heavily in-
vested in South Africa than the
United States. If they pull out, that
would crush the South African
economy. If the United States pulls
out, it will only make the situation
more difficult for the oppressed.

Pitt professor David Platt has pro-

4

posed a program to help educate
black South African youths. He said
the problem in South African educa-
tion is ‘rooted \‘at the elementary
school level. Platt suggests the univer-
sity sponsor the education of a
number of black South African
youths.

If all the members of Students For
a Free South Africa put their efforts
into helping individual blacks in
South Africa, they could change
some people's lives. That's more than
Pitt's divestment can accomplish.

Ifa moral statement is so important,
it's already been given by Pitt ad-
ministrators. Pitt's policy of selective
divestment is geared to improve the
treatment of non-white workers in
South Africa.

Pitt invests in companies doing
business in South Africa only if they
adhere to the Sullivan Principles, a
set of rules governing fair treatment
of all workers, regardless of race.

The principles have been criticized
for not helping blacl<:~ be treated fair-
ly, even by the Rev. Leon Sullivan,
creator of the document. Sullivan
said the principles should be discard-
ed by May of next year if no‘signifi—

cant advancement is made.

But even if Sullivan calls for total
divestment, is that really the answer?
The sanctions passed by Congress last
week come close to nationalizing
certain U.S. industries in South
Africa. -

It bars imports of iron, steel, coal,

uranium, textiles and agricultural '

products. It also prohibits new U.S.
corporate investment and bank loans
to government-run agencies in South
Africa. '

Even though thousands of people
have died under the totalitarian apart-
heid system, does the United States
have the right to purposely harm the
economy of a sovereign nation?

' President Reagan has been sharp-
Iy criticized for his policies of in-
tervention in Nicaragua. Congress
passed the controversial aid package
for the Contra rebels. Does the U.S.
have the right to purposely attempt

to damage a country's economic‘

investing in these companies cannot

. be taken for granted nor accepted as.

loss, if we divested.

The fact of the matter is, it needn't
be. Other universities have proven
this already. If they can survive
without money made through op-
pression, why can't we?

The answer seems to be that we
know we can. Then another question
arises. Why should we? It would be
more difficult to find other ways to
make money on investments than to
admit that what we are doing is
wrong. It is wrong.

People are dying there. I know this
is an idealistic way of looking at
things. I can't feel the pain. Neither
can the board of trustees, nor the
demonstrators. '

It is very easy to say, ”What do I
care. It isn't hurting me anyway.”

Fine.

The people in South Africa can
continue to die, but let's not be a part
of it. If they want to fight for their
human rights, let them do so. That
isn't hurting us either. _

Being on the right side of history.

base, therefore making the govern-
ment weaker?

That seems to follow the-divest-
ment argument — take away apart-
heid's economic base so the system
will collapse and a revolution will
occur. .

If we really want to sponsor a
revolution in South Africa, why don't
we send in some military advisors to
organize the black trade unions. Bet-
ter yet, why don't we just send in the
Marines? Let's do what we did in
Grenada. M

Congress argues we cannot support
a country which is morally wrong,
but can "our leaders afford to be
moralists? '‘

If we continue this policy of
witholding funds based on a govern-
ment's oppression of its people, we
will have to include most of the coun-
tries in Southeast Asia.

But after Vietnam, people realize
we shouldn't try to intervene in those
countries’ internal affairs.

It's dangerous to make a moral '

issue out of US investments in South
Africa. Who decides which nations
are morally wrong?

Pain from a humiliating experience

It was a warm summer night, and
she decided to have a drink at the
outdoor-seating part of a restaurant.
The restaurant was one of those
places that have started to offer
sidewalk-cafe-style setups for their
customers during nice weather.

So she was sitting with a friend,

talking and enjoying the evening. The

other people at the surrounding
tables were young and apparently af-
fluent; everyone was dressed well,
and the scene could have served as
an advertisement for casual elegance
in the city.

She noticed a boy down at the cor-
ner. He was short and skinny, and he
was black. He appeared to be about
10 years old. He was carrying a
shoeshine kit. .All of the customers in
the outdoor part of the restaurant, she
noticed‘, were white. 4 .

She found herself thinking about
the boy. He seemed awfully young
to be working at night, but she
thought it was good that he was
learning to make a living for himself.
Shoeshining may not be the most ex-
alted form of endeavor in the world,
but it is honest work. -

She saw the boy walk over to the
outdoor cafe portion of the

restaurant. The boy approached a
male customer and apparently asked
if he could shine the man's shoes.
The man shook his head no; the boy
began to walk away.

And that is when it happened. This
is how she tells it: -

”The boy was walking between the
tables, and this man came out of the
restaurant. He looked as if he might
have been the owner or the manager
or something. He took hold of one
of the boy's arms —— remember, this

.is just a little kid — and he literally

threw the boy out toward the street.
He just flung the boy, as hard as he
could. The boy was doing all he
could to keep from falling. He was
still grasping onto his shoeshine kit.

”He caught his balance right by the
curb. He turned around and looked
back at the restaurant. Here were all

these people enjoying their drinks,

and he had just been almost picked
up off his feet and thrown out right
in front of them.‘I looked in his eyes
and I could see anger and fear and
rage and humiliation.

"I felt so terrible for him. He
looked as if he was filled with shame.

”He walked down the street to a
trash can, and pulled out an empty

 

BOB GREENE

soda pop bottle. He walked back to
the cafe and started pacing back and
forth, holding the bottle, staring at the
man who had done it to him. The
man just stood there with his arms

‘ folded, as if daring the boy to make

a move. It was so pathetic. The boy
was so small, there was nothing he
could have done anyway.
”A bouncer at the place next door
saw what was happening, and he
‘went up to the boy and tried to calm

him down. From watching what was L

happening, I got the impression that

the bouncer was attempting to make
the boy feel a little better.. But the boy
stillseemed so humiliated. He pulled
away from the bouncer, and he
walked down the street, and that was
the last that I saw of him.”

She looked around at the -other
people at the ‘outdoor cafe. As far as
she could tell, no one else had even
paid a bit of attention to the incident.

She tried to look at both sides of
the story. Maybe the boy had been
breaking the rules about soliciting
shoeshines. Maybe he had annoyed
customers before.

But still  she replayed the scene

I in her mind’— the owner, right in

front of all the customers, heaving the
boy out toward the street.

She thought: That little boy is out
there somewhere right now, and he's
thinking, ’’Is this all the world is ever
going to give me?" The boy may
have been on private property, and
he may have been unwelcome. But
he wasn't begging; he wasn't steal-
ing. In his way, he was trying to make
a\living. And what he got for it was
public humiliation.

She thought: There must have been

Pittsburgh’ s homeless

  Are they victims of society or

vi cti m s
By Frances Sansig '

and Eric Poole
Staff Writers

The plight of the homeless people
in America is a problem which has
no easy solution.

Sometimes they are the victims of
substance abuse, or they simply do
not have the financial means to afford
a permanent place to live. Whether

- they are victims of society or victims
of their own device is debatable.
ln Monday's issue of The Pitt
News, Forbes, a man who is part of
the homeless population of Pitts-
burgh, told his story, attributing his
homelessness to a substance abuse
problem he has had since World War
ll. .
He finally overcamehis bout with
alcohol a year and a half ago but is
still living on the streets, occasional-
ly staying in a shelter.

With summer ending, more
homeless people will be looking for
a warm place to sleep.

Marilyn Sullivan, from Communi-
ty Human Services of Pittsburgh,
which provides temporary shelter for
men, said a significant proportion of
those whom they shelter are mental-

ly ill, and this is often related 'to——

substance abuse.
However, substancegabuse is not

the only reason men are unable to
keep places to live. Sullivan said
many who come to the facility are
mentally ill because they do not take
necessary medication.

”Usually they need medication
they don't have, so they are in the
throes oftheir psychosis. Those who
are mentally ill, who after treatment,
don't have anywhere to go, go back
off their medication and lapse into
their mental illness — it's like a
revolving_ door situation,” said
Sullivan. 

Community Human Services pro-
vides a mental health outreach team
with two street consultants who
search for homeless people and refer
them to resource centers. It also has
a food service, a job placement pro-
gram, and it makeshealth care ac-
cessible.

”A lot of people haven’t seen a
doctor in years. Those people we
refer to a clinic,” said Glynda
Lowery, coordinator of the outreach
team at CHS. .

Lowery described facilities and ser-
vices for the homeless as very sparse.
”There’s never enough of anything.
There aren't enough shelters, there
aren't enough soup kitchens, and
there aren't enough jobs,” she said.

Considering that the Pittsburgh

area has been one of the hardest hit.

ind_ustry-wise, it is not surprising that

  

of their own device?

the unemployed also compose part
of the homeless population.

‘Unemployment is increasing, and
so is the number of homeless," said
Lowery. _

One unemployed worker, Ron
McMunn, said that if it weren't for his
parents providing a place to live, he
would be in a similar situation.

”l~worked at a place for 18 years.

I lost my home, ;my family, and I'm

handicapped," he said.

But McMunn is doing something
about it. He is a volunteer at the Rain-

of soup kitchens that provide meals
for those who are not only homeless,
but unemployed and cannot afford to

McMunn estimates that the kitchen
serves between 50 and 125 people
on any given day. ”We serve basical-
ly poor people, and some of them
live under the high-level bridge [in

_The kitchen is open five days a

cording to McMunn.

Who is Zippy? What is Zippy?
1 Why is Zippy?

Now there's-a good bunch of
questions. ‘

I sure didn't have the answer,
and the best thing I could think of
was to call the guy who created

. the strip.

50 I did.

At the age of 42, Bill Griffith is
completing his 16th year as author
of Zippy the Pinhead.

He is married and lives in San
Francisco where he creates the

g daily strips for the King Features
Syndicate. '
Zippy the Pinhead is currently
I printed in 45 daily papers across
the country.

The strip itself has not met with
rave reviews in this paper. Most
are simply confused by the
strange-looking character in the
polka-dot suit. The humor is, at
best, hard to find. '

. ”People expect very specific
things out of the comics,” said
Griffith. ”For one, they expect to

. ‘get it.’ I'm playing with that; do-
ing strips in which to ‘get it’ may
mean reading it twice.

opposed to more being there than
meets the eye.

”Zip'py doesn’t subscribe to the
rules we all subscribe to,” Griffith
continued. ”He doesn't under-
stand the nature of shared reality.
He has his own reality. In that
sense he acts as a commentator
on everyone else’s.’’

Griffith said he has been putting‘
political satire into the strip but
doesn't compare it to other comics
such as Bloom County and
Doonesbury.

"I think something like The Far
Side is a relevant comparison,” he
said, ”only because Gary Larson is
mining a kind of unexpected vein
of humor compared to the way
comics have always been. He has
a surreal quality to his stuff.”

The utter strangeness of Zippy
has motivated many to write let-
ters to Griffith, expressing their
confusion with the strip.

”People say things like, ’Zippy
makes fun of retarded people 
Zippy advocates drug abuse,’ ”
Said Griffith.

”Letters like that I treasure
because it's nice to be able to
outrage people.”

One such letter, written by a

reader from Boston, said, ”Zippy
has unleashed the lusts of the
world on Boston.”

”Try and figure that one out,”
he said. ~

”Until now, my audience has
pretty much, stayed the same every
year. Now, it's leaped into V
millions of people who would
never seek it out. Suddenly it's on
their breakfast table, and reactions
can be kind of extreme.” '

Griffith is not a real—life Zippy in
any way. He said the strips are
something he must put himself in
a certain frame of mind to do, but
since the strip provides his liveli-
hood, it isn't a difficult thing to
do. ' .

”|t’s all I'm qualified to do,” he
said. ”There was a point around
1973 when I wondered if I should
keep doing comics. I

preme Court decision on por— '
nography came down. Even
though my strip was only mar-
ginally offensive in that way, the
whole scene almost fell apart
economically. I think I spent the
year doing bubble gum cards.”

Griffith said he thinks the strip is
something people will grow. ac-
customed to, and he hopes people
will take the time to read and
understand the strip.

’’I’m just being more obscure
than Garfield and Bloom County,”
he said. ’’I’m not so far removed

r ”You have to look at it and say,
’I’m not going to read this in three
seconds and have a quick, easy
punchline and go back to my cof-
fee.’ It might require reading it
once or twice more to see there's
more to it than that.

”lt’s just a little bit more de-
manding than the other strips.”

Griffith said a movie based on '
Zippy is in the works. It will be a
live-action film from a script he
and his wife wrote. He said the
final paperwork is being com-
pleted, and filming should begin
early nextyear.

in the meantime, Griffith will
continue to produce the comic
strip. He said it has been his life
for the past 16 years and will con-
tinue to be for the next I6 and
beyond.

”|’m rearranging American
culture for people,” he said. ’’I’m
taking everything people know
and reflecting it back at them in a
fun-house mirror.

”|f Zippy’s about anything,.he’s

about America. He tries to rear- '

range it and make his own kind of
sense out of it. I think‘that’s what
people are doing every day; they
just don't realize it.

”Maybe, in that way, he's like
the man of the future,” Griffith
said. ' -

If this is the case, we may be in
some degree of trouble. Griffith
doesn’t think so, but he's been do-
ing the thing for so long, he pro-
bably wouldn’t know any
difference. ~

After readingvhis work over
again, I began to think maybe he
had a point. Characters like Zippy
and his side-kick She|f—life are
more bizarre than, say, Opus and
Milo of Bloom County, but they
do’ have personality.— a personali-
ty Griffith said is more prevalent
in this society than we recognize.

The economies of developing na-

America must learn to change with
these nations, according to the par-

”a growing liberalization trend in

“countries like China and'lndia.

V.B. Kadam, a World Bank consult-

Third World is currently experienc-

”Developing nations are now
beginning to produce finished prod-
ucts as opposed tothe old-style,
labor-intensive crops,” Kadam said.

Kadam detailed how the United
States might best respond to such
changes

”Developing countries need to be
considered [by the United States] as

_ equal partners in international trade,”

Jun-Van Hong of Beijing Universi-
ty also had some advice for American
policy makers. ’’In developing new

at halfway point

‘*5!’

By Beth Froelich

Staff writer

At the midpoint of a sports season,
a coach tends to look back on a
team's past performance and look
ahead to the goals that remain.
Players tend to do the same.
The Pitt Womens’ tennis team,
which has reached the season's mid-
point, has a lot of worthy perform-
ances to reflect upon and some
challenging opponents remaining.
The Lady Panthers’ season record
stands at 5-3. Finishing the season last
in the Big East is something the team
has been accustomed to since they
joined the conference four years ago.
With a focus on hard work and deter-
mination, both players and head
coach George Dieffenbac_h are
expecting to finish the season with
more matches in the win column.

This could prove to be a difficult
task. The remaining matches are
against their toughest competition;
Slippery Rock, West Liberty and West
Virginia.

The team lost to Slippery Rock last
year 3-6 and was beaten soundly by
West Virginia 9-0. They did well
against West Liberty last year,
however, defeating them 8-1.-

Dieffenbach said the Slippery Rock
team is a little bit weaker this year
and expects the matches to be more
competitive.

”These tough matches will prepare
us for the Big East Championships
and will serve as an indication of how
we will perform there,” said Dieffen-
bach. ’’If we win only two of the
three remaining matches, I will be
pleased as a coach because we will
have clinched a winning season.”

Upon reflection, the coach felt that

the team's biggest strengths in the first '

half of this season were their unity,

, hard work and will to win.

Throughout the first part of the
season, the team vastly improved in
their individual games through com-
petition and practice.

The coach pointed out the doubles
game as a bug that needs to be
worked out if the Lady Panthers are
to continue winning matches. _

game," he said. "The experience

Who's Hot in the National Football

League: _

Denver Broncos — Led by quarter-
back John Elway and a rugged
Mecklenbergian defense, the Bron-
cos are unbeaten and flying high atop
the AFC West. On Sunday, Denver

i blew out the Dallas Cowboys 29-14,

while holding Cowboy'running back
Herschel Wa|ker- to 33 yards on 15
carries. .

Gerald McNeil — Nicknamed the
”lce Cube," Cleveland's first-year
return specialist brought a Pittsburgh
kickoff back 100 yards in aiding

Cleveland's 27-24 victory over the

Steel§rs.*Two Sundays ago versus
Detroit, McNeil returned a punt 84
yards‘ for another score. '

Jeff Kemp — Subbing for injured.
quarterback Joe Montana, Kemp has -

stepped into the 49er offense and led

his club to two consecutive victories. ’ ' '

Last week, San Francisco smashed
Miami 31-16, then on Sunday, they

lowered the. boom on the Colts
35-14. Against Indianapolis, Kemp-

was a nifty 18 for 29, compiling 274

passing yards. .
Chicago Bears — Last year's Super

Bowl Champs haven't slumped a bit

in 1986. Sunday the unbeaten Bears

shut out M1‘-nnesota 23-0-and are easi-
ly headed toward a second con-

Houston Oilers — Despite owning
the No. 1 ranked defense in the AFC,
Houston has a 1-4 record and a Lip-

Lots of trouble with thistalent-laden

been a big disappointment, but his
immense contract makes him im-
possible to unload. But Coach Clan-

within the next few seasons.

Miami Dolphins — Something is
dreadfully wrong with Don Shula’s
club. Miami has been destroyed in
three of their first five games, yielding
an astounding 35 points-per-game to
opponents. Unless something drastic
occurs, the ’Fins will not make the

The Big East is an extremely

St. Louis Cardinals — The Cards

A long overdue letter to Foge azo

Serafino D. Fazio

Notre Dame Stadium
University of Notre Dame
Notre Dame, IN 46556

Dear Foge,

You haven't called. You haven't
written. We were beginning to
wonder, Foge. '

Rest assured, things are just fine
here at youralma mater. They had

this stupid sign stretching across-

Forbes Avenue, ”Oakland, A World
Within A City,” but they finally took
it down. There has been some trou-
ble lately near the Original, but fear
not — Ironhead is staying out of trou-
blegln fact, Craig Heyward is play-
ing exceptionally well. You're not
going to believe this, but he has
beaten out Charles Gladman as the
starting tailback. Although Ironhead
has gained some weight, Gladman
h_as fumbled once too often for Coach
Mike Gottfried.

Remember him?

Mike Gottfried?

He sits in your old desk, Foge. _He
moved Syd, your old secretary, out
of the football office and into the
ticket office. Poor Syd. Pretty tough
cookie, this Gottfried fellow.
Remember Brian Davis? He didn't
make the grade with the new coach.

Dexter Hairston? He won the fight’

against another student but lost the
ensuing battle with Gottfried. Tony
Williams? He learned not to mess
with the Delta Tau Delta brothers.

him with a freshman, and he missed

The Shutout Kid
 Soccer
goalie
tough to
score on

‘By V_ince Carey
Staff Writer

  

 

Pitt soccer coach Joe Luxbacher
may have stumbled onto something
special in goalie Mark Hendricks.

As of last Friday, this sophomore
.from -Maryland had registered five

' shutouts in six games. The Pitt record
is 10, and it is not even halfway
through the season. ”Thoughts about
the record are in the back of my
mind,” Hendricks commented.
”_Everyone on the team letsme know
about it, but I would much rather see

, the team get farther [in the Big East

’ _, playoffs], than.set the record.

' ”We have some tough games com-
ing up against Seton Hall and West
Virginia. I'm glad we play them at
home, because the team plays much
better on turf than grass.” '

Hendricks’ major is in the health
‘related professions, and he hopes to"
get into hospital administration. ’’It
has-been harder this term,” said Hen--
dricks. ”Everything is starting to pile
up; ‘I just have to make sure
everything gets done. It may mean
sacrificing some time on the —
weekend. You just have to setyour
priorities.” .

' Coming into this season, the goalie
was a big question mark on the team.
Dave Torrence had been Pitt's starter
for the last four years, but he was lost
to graduation. ”There is no doubt
about it that finding a new goalie was"
our top priority,” said Coach Lux-
bacher. ”But Mark has done a very
good job‘. He has a lot of natural
talent, and he works hard to improve
on top of that. He has never been in

' the spotlight like this, but he is a self-

motivated person and handles it

well.”

' You might wonder why he, being
from Maryland, didn't stay around.

I grew up in one of those families

hand tuned into the Notre Dame
game. '

My parents tell me the first words
I ever spoke were ”Notre Dame,” or
some derivative of those words as on-
ly a 2-year-old could deliver them.
The first song I ever learned was the
Notre Dame fight song. Whenever I
played football in my back yard I was

always Notre Dame. I made the other .

team be Penn State. lfl was playing

against kids I didn't like, I made them ‘

be USC.

I guess when I was young I had to '

like Notre Dame. It was in my blood.
My grandmother, in her younger
days, lived in South Bend, Ind. Her
family lived across the street from the
Rockne family, and my grandmother
counted Mrs. Rockne among her best
customers in her little hairdressing

shop. There was no way I could get
around it, I was born to love Notre-
Dame.

 

Needless to say, it was not a rela-
tionship I entered into unwillingly.

During my childhood Notre Dame,

like good teams, even easier when
that team was Notre Dame. The
Notre Dame football team had more
style than any other team on Earth..
To this day I think there is magic in
their golden helmets, maybe a little
bit of gold stolen from a Ieprechaun’s
potjust to bring them luck. But there
is more than luck in the Notre Dame
helmets. Gold has always been a sign
of purity and nobility, and I grew up

believing Notre Dame had both. For .

some reason I still do. One of the first
football games I remember watching
is the 1973 Sugar Bowl between
Notre Dame and Alabama. I
remember it because it was the first

time my parents let me stay. up_until I

Q

Q,“

,F,,themse|ves the Fighting Irish. I

What is Notre Dame?

For me, it is a reason to cheer for

the opponent.

Don't get me wrong now. I per-
sonally have nothing against the
school. I just disagree with some of
the aspects of its athletic programs.

Aspect No. 1: The Fighting Irish

Formality — You see, they call

I

‘thanks to my mom, am of Irish

bloodlines, and cringe when I hear

that.

Just look down the roster. You
don't find too many lrishmen. A
perfect example is the man they
feature on the cover of their football
media guide. He is team captain
Mike Kovaleski.»I don't know of too
many Irishmen whose last name ends
in ”s-k-i.”

Hey, take nothing away from the
guy. He is a great football player, and
he will probably cause Pitt some
problems this weekend in South
Bend, but he just doesn't sound Irish.

Here are some other names for you
from the ”|rish” (that hurts) roster:
Terry Andrysiak, (He must have gone
to Dublin Central.) Braxton Banks (a
former Irish Republican Army spy),
D’Jaun and Hiawatha Francisco (from
the Irish Spring commercial). They
even have Foge Fazio. There is no
way he is Irish. He's about as Irish as
Sammy Davis Jr. I rest that point.

Aspect No. 2: The Faust Fac-
tor — Everybody remembers Gerry
Faust. The former ”Irish” (that hurts)
coach who is now at Akron. Faust
was out of his league, but he was

great from a public relations point of

view. He was religious, he ‘was

warm-hearted, he was compassion-
ate, and he was a loser.

Through five‘ seasons, Faust won

with the best talent in‘ the nation.

He had jumped from a high school,
Moeller in Cincinnati, straight to
Notre Dame. He is probably the last

high school coach who will ever.‘

have that sort of opportunity.

Said one prominent Pittsburgh area
high school football coach: ”Gerry
Faust blew it for all of us.”.

You can say that again. He may
have been a great guy, but he didn't
win enough football games. If you
don't win football games, you don't
make any money for the school.
Money talks — even at Notre Dame.

Aspect No. 3: The Game lersey
Confusion — I have never seen any
team, whether it be little league, high
school, college or pro, that has
changed its game jerseys as much as
Notre Dame has over the years. It
seems like every time I turn the TV

in on, if Notre Dame is playing, they
\ have a new style of game jersey on.

One day it is blue, one day it is green.

are blue, sometimes gold, sometimes
white and sometimes no stripes at all.

at Notre Dame. No argument here.-, an  
I will admit that Notre Dame has  

a lot of tradition. They won one for

Cleveland, Larry Wanke hopes to

former graduate of that school has

- the victories that had always been ab-

' Panthers return to the winning ways

"ii;  that were the norm during the '70s

I" and early '80s. _
Wanke chose Pitt over Boston Col-
lege, Miami, Ohio State and Penn

fiState. He cited reasons such as:

”Penn State was too drab. Miami was

 too far from home. Ohio State did not

throw the ball enough.”

to help the team get better. He's just

 basically a good guy.”

I Hendricks sees a big difference in

, ' this year's team. “I feel we are a lot

closer this year. Maybe it's because

 I was a freshman last year [that] I

didn't feel it as much. You always
hear how the football team is like a

felt that he might get the chance to
play right away. Wanke said the ad-
dition of new head coach Mike Gott-
fried‘ to the declining football
program was the deciding factor for
choosing Pitt. Wanke felt that he
could blend in well with the new
open-style offense that was going to
be installed.

At the beginning of the season, no
one was sure in which direction the
Pitt offense was headed. The addition
of John Congemi to ‘the race for the
starting job meant that newcomers
Sal Genilla, a record-setting junior
college transfer from San Mateo, Ca.,
and Wanke would have to battle ex-
perience for the top spot. Experience
won out.

With Congemi adapting well to the
new offense, it seemed that Wanke

other. It's a good feeling.”

One thing that upsets Hendricks is
the lack of support from the Pitt
students. ’’I wish we had more peo-
ple come out for the games. Since we
have such a good team, this is the
time to get involved. In high school
we sometimes had as many as 2,000
people for a game, and a major
university can only manage 200. I've
started to adjust to the small crowds.
High school soccer is getting more
popular in the area, so maybe next
year more will come up to the

The year will probably not count
against him, however, because he
will most likely be redshirted at the

Soccer

, Continued from page 11
”We struggled in the first half,’’
Luxbacher said, ”but in the second
_half we looked much better. ‘We
showed some good things. Not only
did we score, but we played well.”
In the second half, the Panthers
came out shooting. Freshman Jim
Bottomley came off the bench at the
striker position and played a strong
game, scoring two of the Panthers’
goals.
”lim’s play was a pleasant sur-
prise,” Luxbacher said. ”He was a

)real spark to our offense. He proved

that he can play.”

Another player who was strong off
the bench was John Osberg. He add-
ed two goals andone assist for the
Panthers and played a key role in the
win.

”John did a great job,” Luxbacher
commented. ”He has been having
problems with injuries, but he looked
good. He is going to be a factor for
us.”

The Panthers played Vanderbilt in

.the championship game, after they
won a shoot out 6-5 over Marshall,
following a 1-1 tie at the end of the
overtime period. Vanderbilt was a
«much stronger team than Moore-

   
 
  

 

 Wanke content t ait for next season

end of the season, barring a sudden
rash of injuries to Pitt quarterbacks.
Should he be redshirted, he will
maintain his four years of eligibility.
In the meantime, Wanke will have
to be content with exchanging bombs
with Genilla as they both guide the
scout team. More often than not, the
scout team quarterback takes his
share of lumps while giving the No.
1 defense suitable practice, but
Wanke does not regard this year as
lost. With John Congemi doing a fine
job of running the offense, Wanke
said he views this year as a good time
to learn the system. During fall camp
and recent scrimmages, Wanke
revealed strong potential, and Gott-
fried has said he is fitting in well.
While -watching Congemi during

thelgames, Wanke can use the ex-

head, but the Panthers were able to
handle -their attack and offset it with
their own strong one.

’’I thought we played well against
Vanderbilt," said Luxbacher. ”Again,
we started out sluggish, going into the
halfwith a 0-0 tie. We were for-
tunate, though, that Vanderbilt did
not score.”

Pitt goalie Mark Hendricks, who
was strong throughout the tourna-
ment, made two great saves to thwart
Vanderbilt and keep the Com-
modores from taking an early lead.

”Mark played exceptionally well in
the Vanderbilt game,” Luxbacher
said. ”He made some great saves for
us. We could easily have been los-

. ing going into the half if it were not

for his play.”

The Panthers came out in the sec-
ond half a much more determined
team. Gude once again teamed with
Hammond to start the Panthers scor-
ing early in the second half. Defender
Dan Liberati scored the second goal
for Pitt on an assist by Dave Moss,
and Sam Lanza added the game-
winning goal on-an unassisted shot,
putting the Panthers ahead 3-0.

But Vanderbilt was determined not

to give up. In the last seven minutes

In performing well during the scrim-
mages, he can get the type of con-
fidence that has been lacking in the
Pitt program.

Larry Wanke’s role as a backup
should not be trivialized. Even with
the probability that he will be red-
shirted, there may still be a need for
him to play. During the 1976
National Championship season, Pitt
used three different starting quarter-
backs. All three, Bobby Haygood,
Matt Cavanaugh and Tom Yewcik,
stepped in when they were needed
without missing a beat.

Wanke said that if needed, he will
be ready to play, but for now he will
also gear up for the battle with

Genilla for the starting quarterback -

position next year.

of the game they scored two goals
and threatened aithird, butthe Pan-
thers were able to stop them cold,
winning the game 3-2 and clinching
the tournament.

’’I was very happy with the way a
lot of our guys played,” Luxbacher
said. ”Sam Lanza came in and was
a real force in our attack; He played
like we know he can. Erim also was
very strong. He was consistent
throughout. ’

”Coming off the bench, some of
our young players did a great job.

‘Rob Smetak and Scott Armstrong

both showed that they can do the job.
They both played strong games.”

Gude, who had two goals and two
assists, was named the offensive
player of the tournament, while
senior Todd Smith got defensive
player honors. In addition, Hen-
dricks, Bottomley and Liberati were
all named to the all-tournament team.

After tonight, the Panthers’ next
game is Saturday at 7:15 p.m. against
Big East rival Seton Hall at Pitt
Stadium. The Pirates are ranked sec-
ond in the Mid-Atlantic region and
18th in the nation.

Do you know why the Pitt News is a quest? Neither do I, but I think it makes a damn noticable headline. Anyway,
don't just throw this paper onto the ground when you're finished reading it. This paper is a living, breathing entity.
It survives by feeding off of the hungry eyes of concerned readers. When you toss this aside, a twinge of guilt 3
your newspaper means you are not interested in yourself.

When the heaps of The Pitt News are piled in the hallways of the basement in the Cathedral, take a step back ;
and watch the different kinds of readers. Some flip directly to the Sports section. Some see something interesting
on the front page. Others turn to Zippy. But what about those hearty few who take not one, not two, but an entire
bundle of The Pitt News. Do they wallpaper their dorm rooms with it? Do they use it as bathroom tissue? No,

meone to get open. Clements lofted
a desperation throw upfield an ins-
tant before he was smothered by an
Alabama lineman. Miraculously, tight
end Robin Weber caught the pass at

~ the 38-yard line. Notre Dame won

the game and the national champion-
ship. It was truly a happy New Year
in our house.

There were other memories like
that. Moments that I will never forget.
They are fuzzy memories now, like

film "on an old newsreel, but

priceless. Who will ever forget that
game on. a Sunday afternoon in 1973
when Notre Dame's basketball team
snapped UCLA's incredible 88- game
winning streak with a jump shot at
the buzzer. ~.

Clearer is the 1979 Cotton Bowl.
Down 34-12 with 4:40 left in the
third quarter, it looked bleak for Dan
Devine’s troops. But Notre Dame has
been known for their comebacks ever
since George Gipp was hospitalized

Deluded

Continued from. page 15

Dan Devine used to be the head

I coach of the Packers, right after the

glory years in Green Bay. During his
reign as head coach, the Pack took
a turn for the worse. Green Bay even-
tually got rid of Devine, but guess
who hired him soon after — Notre
Dame.

Devine coached there for six years
and won 53 games, lost 16, tied one

with strep throat in 1920, and on that
cold New Year's "Day in Dallas, the
Irish made what some called their
greatest comeback ever. Joe Montana
led Notre Dame to three touchdowns
in the final seven minutes of the
game. The final score came on a
Montana-Kris Haines touchdown
pass with no time left on the clock.
The extra point, as it always seems
to be for Notre'Dame, was good and
the Irish had their second straight Cot-
ton Bowl victory. '

When I was younger I never
wondered why I liked Notre Dame.
It was unquestioned. It was like ask-
ing why I liked ice cream. ljust did,
that's all. But once I got into junior
high I began to examine just what it
was I liked about Notre Dame.

First there was the image and the

tradition. Notre Dame has always

been a school which puts academics
ahead of athletics. Notre Dame does

.not redshirt players. Notre Dame has

no academic dorms. The graduation

and brought one national champion-
ship back to South Bend. '

Meanwhile, the Pack‘ has yet to
recover. ‘

That was the final straw.

So, I'm sorry. I used to hate Notre
Dame, but I am getting better. Now,
I just dislike them.

My mom loves Notre Dame be-
cause she is Irish, but I dislike Notre

-Dame because I am Irish. Different‘

strokes for different folks, I guess.

Reagan is.

Hey!

Sometimes in life you start to feel like Charles Manson.
Things just get you real mad, real fast.

Like the time you got on the bus and four obnoxious winos
talked to you about how they met Lawrence Welk once.

Or the time some person on an Oakland street stopped you
to inform you he had the secret to ending the threat of nuclear
war. All you had to do was buy a paper for 75 cents and you
would learn everything about peace and how evil Ronald

Or the time the toilet in your apartment overflowed and your
landlord promised he'd be there to fix it. Within the next week.

Or the time you got mad at yourself because all your study-
ing was done, and you didn't feel fulfilled’. You needed to create
something the whole campus would appreciate.

There's, no point in getting mad and killing someone.
Relax. Take it easy. Be groovy.

rate of Notre Dame's basketball
players is among the highest in the
nation. Notre Dame has never been
placed on NCAA probation for rules
violations, they have never even
been investigated. Father Hesburgh
and George Corrigan are running a
clean ship. ‘
Then there are the stories. Legends
and myths worthy of the ancient
Greeks. George Gipp asking Knute
Rockne to ”win one for the Gipper.”
And ‘then an injured Notre Dame
team went out and beat Army in a
game that launched the Notre Dame
legend. A few years later, Grantland
Rice immortalized Notre Dame's
1924 offensive backfield with these
words: ”Outlined against a blue-gray

October sky, the Four Horsemen .
. rode again. In dramatic lore they are

known as famine, pestilence, destruc-
tion and death. These are only

aliases. Their‘ real’ names are
Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and

Ijayden.”

It's your

Beyond that are the other stories I
spent countless hours locked in my
bedroom reading about: ”Theisman
for Heisman,” the tie with Michigan
State in 1966, Johnny Lujack and
Paul ‘ Hornung, John Huarte and
Angelo Bertelli, Frank Leahy and
Touchdown Jesus.

There is no other collegiate football
program in America that can com-
pete with tradition like that. Not Penn
State, not Pitt, not Ohio State, not
Alabama, not Oklahoma.

There was all that, yet there is
something more. Notre Dame. I
guess I can't say exactly why I love
Notre Dame. Maybe it is not Notre
Dame I love so much as all that Notre
Dame stands for. Perhaps it is the"
honor and noble tradition that sur-
rounds the Golden Dome. Perhaps it
is the high_idea|s Notre Dame aspires
to. Perhaps that is what I love about

' Notre Dame.

Ra but it. 

Talk about it...

Or maybe it is something deeper; V 2- 

Something that goes far beyond any
explanations. Something that is just
a feeling, an unknown emotion. For

when I see the helmets glowing

under the autumn sun and hear the
victory march played in all its ﬁre,

there is in me such a-feeling as I have '

never felt before, or will ever feel
again.

Cheer, cheer for old Notre
Dame

Wake up the echoes cheering
her name .
Send a volley cheer on high
Shake down the thunder from
the sky -
What though the odds be great
or small?

Old Notre Dame will win over
all

While her loyal sons go marching
Onward to victory
