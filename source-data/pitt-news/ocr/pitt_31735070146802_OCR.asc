Meghan McCain,daughterofSen.John

“I’ve had conversations, but the
homeboy is 73,” she said with a smile
to the audience, which erupted into
laughter.

McCain visited Pitt’s campus last

McCain spoke about Don’t Ask Don’t

Republican party.

She began her 25-minute speech
highlightingthe recentsuicides among

gay teens and gay prejudice in poli-
tics. -

“At what point is it enough?” Mc-
Cain asked the crowd. ‘At what point
isitbigoting?” _ .

She said Republicans also question
her dedication to the party because of
her stance on gay-rights issues. Even

“We won’t get kicked out of the
party or silenced,” she said. “Silence
equals death.”

McCain gtaduatedfrom Columbia

to The Daily Beast; Her recent book,
“Dirty Sexy Politics,” was sold at the
lecture.

“Itwas originally “Sex, Drugs and

Media veterans talk internships

Seven journalists comprised panel that discussed how to get an internship

Amy Friedenberger
Staff Writer

Since graduating from Pitt in 2009,
Katelyn Polantz has turned an in-
ternship at The Roanoke Times in
Virginia into a job.

As one of seven panelists, Po-
lantz talked about the beneﬁts of
internships last night in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union Ballroom. Pitt’s
English Department and The Pitt
News cosponsored the event, titled
“The Inside Track to a Top-Notch
Internship,” which was moderated
by David Shribman, the executive
editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Ga-
zette. -

The panelists all agreed that

_ an applicant’s passion can be the

deciding factor in getting an in-
ternship.

“I want someonewho is pas-

sionate and ready to just do,”
Terfy Foxx, program director for
Pittsburgh Sportsradio 93.7 The
Fan}-.said. “I’ve seen some beautiful
resumés, but it always comes back
to the passion.”
' Some “don’ts” of seeking an in-
ternship include giving a potential
employer a bottle of vodka along
with a resumé. Also, an intern
shouldn’t crash a rental car when
sent on a reporting job.

The panel featured profes-
sionals who represent the jour-
nalism, publishing and public re-
lations ﬁelds. Panelists included
Mike Leary, managing editor of
The Philadelphia Inquirer; Paul
Steiger, editor-in-chief, president
and CEO of ProPublica, an Internet
investigative-joumalism publica-
tion; Anne Linaberger, KDKA-TV
news director; Cynthia Sterling,
executive publisher of Sterling-
House Publisher, Inc.; Tom Mein-
ert, partner at Meinert Mashek

Communications LLC; Foxx and
Polantz.

Polantz attended an intern-
ship panel last spring where she
met the online editor of The Roa-
noke Times. After one meeting
over coffee, Polantz applied for
and received an internship at the
newspaper.

For‘ other Pitt students search-
ing for internships, the Heinz En-
dowments, a Pittsburgh-based

graduates are just as capable of
attaining jobs in journalism and
public relations.

Steiger said that he doesn’t look
speciﬁcally for Iv_y Leaguers when
searching for employees. He looks
for experience. '

“Many of the best investiga-
tive reporters are those who had
to ﬁght and claw their way up,”
Steiger said.

philanthropy organization, helps
fund students who take on intern-
ships that often don’t provide
compensation. The endowment
fund made the internship panel
possible.

Cynthia Skrzycki, a senior lec-

_turer in Pitt’s English Department,

said that since 2008, 45 students
have gotten “top—notch” intern-
ships. '

The panel members said that
future interns should build a re-
sumé as soon as possible and be
aggressive when pursuing intem—
ships.

“I know why many of you are
here,” Polantz said."‘You don’t
want an internship. You want a
job. The way to get a job is to get
internships.”

Polantz said that experience is
especially important because Pitt
doesn’t have a journalism major
any longer and students are up
against Ivy League competitors.

But the panelists said Pitt

ﬂ

out of internships.

“I was the student who didn’t go
away,” Foxx said. “I wasn’t bugging
him because I didn’t have some-
thing else to do. I just wanted to
talk and express myself.”

As an employer, Foxx looks for
that drive when hiring interns. He
said he wants someone who sets»
goals for himself and, because he
works in sports broadcasting, that
intern must love sports. While he
can’t pay his interns, Foxx said he
can guarantee free attendance at
Pittsburgh Penguins games and

' football games.

In addition to the internship
panel, juniorjohn Manganaro was
named the winner of the Al Mc-
Dowell- Award in Nonﬁction. The
award is named in honor of the late
Pittsburgh broadcasting pioneer
Al McDowell and includes a prize
of $1,000 in tuition remission.

on ethics, sustainability

Ryan Shuagnessy

For The Pitt News

John Perkins, a self—proclaimed “con man,”
spoke about the value of corporate integrity
last night against a backdrop of bald eagles
and American ﬂags. 

More than 700 people attended his lec-
ture in Soldiers 8: Sailors Memorial Hall
on his roles as an economic hitman, Peace

Corps member and CEO of an alternative .

energy company.

Perkins spoke about his past experiences
with what he calls the American “corpora-
tocracy.” The corporatocracy includes the

heads of major U.S. corporations that, ac— .
' cording to Perkins, assert global dominance

through “predatory capitalism,” or proﬁt
maximization without credence to social
and environmental costs.

A Perkins explained in an interview that

citizens and U.S. companies, hesaid.
Although he spoke against ruthless busi-

- ness tactics during his lecture, Perkins was

once an integral part of the “corporatoc-
racy.” A ‘

Students can change this, he said.

“The solution is ethical leadership —— a
new form of consciousness. Making proﬁts
and doing good are not exclusive,” Perkins
said.

Perkins said he is trying to assuage his
past transgressions through heavy involve-
ment with nonproﬁt organizations, such as
Dream Change, which promotes sustain-
able living, and through his commitment
to spreading his message. .

GSPIA student Betty Cruz invited the
best—selling author and coordinated the
event. ‘

Cruz, who said Perkins’ book, “Confes-
sions of an Economic Hitman,” was disgust-

when he was hired as what he considered
to be an “economic hitman” or “con man,”
his official title was “economist.”

_ His history drew Zachary Zeli, vice presi-
dent of proj ect developments for Students in
Free Enterprise at Pitt, to the lecture.

“I heard what he did was completely
wrong,” he said.

For 10 years, Perkins participated in
predatory capitalism and manipulated po-
litical leaders of developing countries to

“ accept unfavorable loans.

He said his goal was to corrupt political
leaders to accept certain loans — whichdid

No apologies

Former Vice President Dick
Cheney shot a guy (by mistake).
But that’s old news. What’s sur—
prising is that ﬁve years after the
notorious bird-hunting accident,
he has yet to apologize-for it. Ac-
cording to The Washington Post,
the only time the vice president
acknowledged his misﬁre was
four days after the fated event,
when he appeared on Fox News
and took responsibility for the
shooting. He has yet to use the
word “sorry.” Even if Cheney’s
heart might not work as well as
others’, he’s at least capable of
apologizing: His atoning in 2008
for the disdainful words he used
toward West Virginians wasn’t
a fantasy. This causes us a bit of
distress: If making fun of West
Virginia is worse than shooting
a man in the face, then The Pitt
News is in serious trouble.

Porn-out

Workers- are staying home
in Southern California, and it
doesn’t have to do with pot this
time. According to AFP, many
adult ﬁlm companies based
near Los Angeles are suspending
production after one porn actor
tested positive for HIV. While we
wish the best of health for the
actors, The Pitt News would es-
pecially like to extend our con-
dolences to New York guberna-
torial candidate Carl Paladino,
a family-values candidate who
has said accepting homosexuals
is tantamount to being “brain-
washed.” Since WNYMedia.net
reports that in 2009 he allegedly
electronically sent around videos

depicting lesbian sex — calling
them “awesome” — we hope he
isn’t too upset that he won’t have
new material for some time.

Sext control

According to TechCrunch, the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Of-
ﬁce just approved a patent for an
iPhone application that prevents
“sexting.” If implemented, the
application would let adminis-
trators -—— like parents or phone-
issuing employers — block users
from sending or receiving text
messages with “objectionable”
material. Given the salacious,
text-based scandals surround-
ing high-proﬁle athletes like Brett
Favre and Greg Oden, maybe the
NBA and NFL should require such
electronic “jock-blocking” as part
of their upcoming collective-bar-
gaining agreements.

All in the family

The idea of “ruling families”
is supposed to be obsolete in a
perfect democracy such as our
own, right? Well, according to an
Associated Press article that cites
research from Ancestry.com,
President Barack Obama is re-
lated to Former President George
W.‘ Bush and Former Alaska Gov.
Sarah Palin. Although landing in
widely disparate arenas of the
political spectrum, Obama and
Bush are 11th cousins, Obama
and Palin are 10th cousins and
Palin and Bush are 10th cousins
once removed. In light of the re-
cently discovered familial ties,
perhaps now Sarah and George
can provide Barack with his birth
certiﬁcate. I ~

Eco—labeling should  

be more responsible

Companies should stop advertising products as ‘green’ when they ’re not.

Kayla Hunter A

For The Pitt News

Green is considered a relaxing
color. It invokes images of leaves
rustling in trees, prairie grasses
blowing in the wind and takes us to
a place we perceive as calmer and
simpler than our hectic modern
lives. But in the past several years,
the term “green” has taken on a
connotation that has nothing to
do with color. One that, in spite
of its ties to nature, sometimes
makes me want to scream.

I’m of course referring to the
popularity of the now cliché phrase
“going green,” the morphed form
of environmentalism that in many
cases is a meaningless trend.

I admit that it is fantastic that
environmental concepts such as
energy efﬁciency and wasteful-
ness are in the public eye now. Who
would have thought 10 years ago

that carrying a reusable water
bottle would be hip with anybody
but crunchy weirdos? But like any
issue that goes mainstream, many
key points of the environmental
movement have been simpliﬁed
or just plain bastardized. This is
partly because of the necessity
of making concepts clearer and
easier to understand for mass
audiences-, but it’s also due to the
work of marketers and advertis-
ers who decided to capitalize on a
spreading wave of eco—awareness
in the nation.

We see this in a proliferation
of green merchandise: a line of

nifty shoulder bags with pictures _

of trees on them, metal and plas-
tic bottles emblazoned with the
word “green,” useful objects that
become more status symbols spe-
ciﬁcally marketed to those swept
up in the eco—hullabaloo.

And while, yes, it’s true that
eating out of areusable container

is better than going through a bil-
lion plastic bags, the notion that
one must go out and purchase
something new (and trendy) to
do this goes against the original
ethos ofreusing what one already
has. This new environmentalism
is a far stretch from the custom of
my mom’s days of drinking water
from old Mason jars.

That’s what this marketing has
done: turned something very anti-
commercial into a commodity. It’s
like the irony behind Che Guevara
merchandise —— the fact that the

. face of perhaps one of the most

vocal critics of capitalism appears
on so many useless products.
‘ But nobody who buys a Che T-

shirt is thinkingabout that, be— ,
cause we don’t usually mull over ’

the things we buy — and this is
what marketers bank on for eco-
labeling. They have ﬁgured out
how to get consumers’ attention,
not by making their products less

Make academic connections

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
Columnist

 

Think back to middle andhighschool.
What do you remember? I remember
classes being separately scheduled
chunks of time, each preordained to
cover a single subject. When the bell

. rang, that meant to stop thinking

about biology and to start thinking
about English. You never imported
your knowledge of the cell to a class

’ session dedicated to Shakespeare’s

sonnets.
It’s a regrettable reality that with
that physicaltime separation followed

, amentaltendencytonotassociateand

integrate subject matter from differ-
ent classes. The practice can only be
described as a hindrance to learning.

College seems to hold much of the
same. We stillhave scheduled, separate
classes that simply breed that same
‘mentality. However, now is an appro-
priate time to reassess our learning
methodology. Consider ways that you
canrelate seemingly differenttopicsto
gainamore substantiveunderstanding
of all ofthem. Sometimes it’shard, and
atﬁrst itwill seem silly. But hopefully,
Withpractice,youwillﬁnd itbeneﬁcial
and itwill set your mind free.

There are many quick examples of

i this inpractice. Ifyou’ve taken organic

chemistry, you’ve learned something
about aromaticity. Yotfveleamedthat
there is a special stability in the ben-
zene ring-—— electrons switchbackand
forth about a six—membered carbon
ring. Well, if you recall from physics,
applying an-external magneticﬁeldcan
induce these electrons to spin along
the ring— think solenoid. This affects
the chemical shifts inboth carbonand
proton nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. _
Somethingyou learned isolatedin
a physics class was actually the core
science behindanapplication— spec-
troscopy—you practiced so fervently

in organic chemistry.

Physics and organic chemistry are
both natural sciences though. Canthis
sort of cross-classroom association
be applied along the age-old barrier
of the arts and the sciences? Fear not,
it can.

Let’s take a simple example. You
might have read Dante’s “Inferno”
and learned that at the beginning of
the circles of hell, the long passage
toward the center of the Earth is the
Vestibule. Here reside the folk that
were not against God but did not ac-
cept him either. In neuroscience you
will likely learn of a system that also
lies at the beginning of a long canal,
the ear canal that is. This system in-

ent classes,

tegrates information from the body’s
periphery to maintain balance and a
sense of spatial orientation. It’s called
the vestibular system.

Now there isn’t a complex rela-
tionship here between literature and
neuroscience. But if you’ve learned of
both, there is no reason to not asso-
ciate them. It’s easier to remember
each, the Vestibule and the vestibular
system, if you do.

Now a deeper example. In intro-
ductory biology, you learn ofhomeo—
stasis. Putrathercrudely, homeostasis
is the maintenance of a stable, steady
environmentinthebodybythe use of
feedback systems.’So if aparameteris
too great, the body senses it andcauses
a cascade of events to work against,
reverse or nullify that parameter: This

political science atTemple University,
argues that the sway of public opinion
is homeostatic. When policymakers
enact legislationthatis too liberal, the
general public becomes, on average, a
little more conservative. When poli-
cies are too conservative, the general
public becomes a little more liberal.
In the same fashion as the human
body,_ a body of people maintains a
fairly consistent general opinion about
politics.
Although your mind might not
jump to the idea of bodily homeosta-
sis when you read about public opin-
ion, such habits are not prohibited.
Ifyou do associate the ideas, you can
extrapolate on each of them and real-

Approach knowledge with the belief
that there is much common ground,

and you will understand it all more

thoroughly. Approach knowledge for
what it is, not what we label it as.

So as you are jugglingthe different
classes you take, your major require-
ments, general education require-

wasteful, but just by making us
believe that they are. -

Earlier this month, the Federal
Trade Commission addressed this
deceptiveness by updating their
aptly named “Green Guides” for
environmental marketing for the
ﬁrst time since 1998. According
to The New York Times,'the new
revisions demand greater trans-
parency and straightforwardness
on the part of marketers. For ex-
ample, companies cannot use la-
bels such as “eco—friendly” unless
they can back up that claim with
speciﬁc examples.

The revisions also force com-

panies to clearly state whether -

an environmental label on their
product was certiﬁed by a third
party or by the company itself. It
was because of this last stipula-
tion that the FTC came down on
SCJohnson last year, denouncing
the ‘usage of its “Greenlist” label,
which appeared to be a third party’
certiﬁcation but was in fact just a
marketing ploy of the company.
It was nice to see the FTC rec-
ognizing the increased crockery
behind eco-labeling, but as the
changes to the guidelines are
not monumental — mainly just
clariﬁcations of previously vague
points — I can’t see them making
a huge dent in sneaky advertising.
As long as marketers know that
eco-friendliness is something con- .
sumers desire, they will continue
to pursue it. If anything, they will
just get subtler and more manipu-
lative in their methods.
Take, for example, the cur-

respectively. Wendy’s ads display
cascading piles of cocoa and skim
milk when talking about its pseu-
do-ice cream treat, the Frosty, and
McDonald’s spells out the words
in its slogan with whole foods like
fruits, vegetables and eggs. They
emphasize the “realness” of their
products to distract us from the
‘fact that, oh yeah, they’re still the
epitome of processed food.

And what about the use of that
other oh-so-ambiguous descrip-
tor, “natural?” This is one of my
favorites, since anything derived
from a plant, be it cardboard or
high fructose corn syrup, can tech-
nically be called natural. I know
this word has almost no meaning,
and reading it on labels in grocery
stores invites nothing more than
a raised eyebrow and a shake of
the head.

So what’s next? As consumers
wise up and demand to be treated
like rational human beings de-
serving of the truth, where will
advertisers and marketers go?
How will they next ﬁgure out how
to not only trick us into buying
things that we don’t really want
or need, but trick us into believ-
ing those things are something
they’re not‘?

It is the vain hope of this frus-
trated consumer that advertis-
ing abandon the charade and try
something novel: like actually
providing us with solid informa-

tion about previously unknown-
products. Maybe then we could ,

ﬁnally navigate through the muck
of false messages to ﬁnd what we
really want, what’s actually real.

I Although “wingman” mightbeanex-

pression found often in entertainment
similarto “Superbad” and “HowI Met
Your Mother,” the concept originated
in an opera set inatum-of-the—centu—
ry Spanish barbershop.

“The Barber of Seville,” ahighbrow
variation on the theme of a love-struck
man and his accomplice, is Pittsburgh
Opera’s 72nd season opener. Its arias
and overtureswillﬁllthe space of the
Benedum Centerfor onlytwo remain-
ing nights, butfor those who do man-

age to catch the ﬁnal performances,
the experience will leave a lasting
impression.

Approximately 20 years of expe-
rience has taught Pittsburgh Opera
director of marketing and communi-
cations Debra Bell that it takes a vil-
lage to put on an opera. Seasonal and
show—speciﬁc staffs work with a full-
tirne group of employees stationed at
the Pittsburgh Opera’s headquarters
in the Strip District.

“We are a producing opera com-
pany, rather than a presenting opera
company, thereby supporting the 10-
cal economy with jobs in everything
from stitching costumes, building set
pieces, to music, marketing, makeup
and ﬁindraising,” Bell said.

Through music, “The Barber of
Seville” tells the story of how a typi-
cal barber and male socialite named
Figaro becomes a matchmaker for
one of his friends. Just as Dr. Bartolo
decides to propose marriage to his
teenage ward Rosina, he learns that

Carnegie Museum exposes madness in the everyday

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staff Writer

“Ordinary Madness”
exhibition
Carnegie Museum of Art
This Friday tojan. 9

Film screenings Oct. 22 and Nov.
10, 6—7:30 p.m. at the

Carnegie Museum of Art
Theater
Free to public _

Ifyou’ve ever been struck by how
somethingottenover1ookedas“com-
monplace” is actually pretty bizarre,
the Carnegie Museum of Art’s new
exhibit Ordinary Madness might
resonate with you. If you haven’t,
“Ordinary Madness” might make you
start looking at things a little more
closely. so

The exhibit, which opens tonight
with afree reception, examines “The
underbelly of ordinary life, the ac-
tually really messed up  in the
world that we take for granted,” said

Dan Byers, curator of “Ordinary Mad-
ness” and associate curator of con-
temporary art at the museum.

In planning the exhibit, Byers
sought to utilize the museum’s ex-
tensive contemporary art collection,
much of which is not on permanent
display and is infrequently seen by
the public. He speculated that the
museum’s collection is large enough
to do as many as ﬁve exhibits at atime
but is limited by exhibition space.
Many museums today face a similar
problem.

“There are a lot of pieces that are
not normally seen, which is no reﬂec-
tion on their quality,” Byers said.

_ Many art exhibitions progress
chronologically, atrend Byers wanted
to break.

“I wanted to use the opportunity
to remix collection a bit and think
aboutmakingcomparisonsbetween
artworks that we wouldn’t normally
make when we’re trying to tell a cohe-
sive story in other exhibits,” he said.

Byers found inspiration for the ex-
hibit in a collection of poetry titled

“Lunch Poems” by Frank O’Hara, the
curator for the Museum of Modern
Art in New York during the 1950s.
O’Harawrote the poems onhisbreaks
from museumwork at lunch counters
and on demonstration typewriters in
stores. The poems were inﬂuencedby
his work with art but were predomi-
nantly about the city, relationships
and culture.

“I wanted to underline that 
that look so foreign and strange to us
are actually quite ordinary. People
feel alienated by contemporary art
because they don’t recognize it, but
there is something in all of these art
works that you can relate to, some-
thing ordinary, and you can drawthe
meaning from there,” Byers said.

One of the main themes on Byers
mind as he assembled the exhibitwas
the way much of contemporary art
deals with everyday life.

“A lot of what art has been about
for the past 40 or 50 years is mak-
ing us think about ordinary events
in different ways, breaking down the
boundaries between everyday life and

. art. Artists used pop culture as legiti-

mate subjects for art and everyday
materials as legitimate materials for
art making,” he said.

When Byers says the exhibition
has “everything,” he isn’t exaggerating

— artforrns represented in “Ordinary -

Madness” include installation pieces,
paintings, drawings, photographs,
videos, animations, digital works and
sculptures from awide array of mate-

' rials, as well as some short ﬁlms.

The Carnegie Museum of Artwas
among the ﬁrst museums in the na-
tion to establish a ﬁlm department
in 1971.

“The museum has a premier col- A

lection of some.of the most important
ﬁlms that were made in the ’60s and
’7os.

Film, more than any other media,
is suited to dealing with everyday life
because it captures surroundings that
we all know,” Byers said.

The collection of ﬁlms screened
for this exhibit was selected for hav-
ing what Byers described as “other-
worldly or schizophrenic or skewed

Production adds unconventional edge

Barber < 6

Figaro’s friend Count Almaviva loves

» her as well. With Figaro as his ac-

complice, Almaviva attempts to win
Rosina’s heart for good —butﬁrst he
has to overcome the tricky tactics of
Bartolo and the girl’s music instruc-
tor Basilio. .
The music and Italian lyrics for
this opera are provided by composer
Gioachino Rossini, with a libretto by
Cesare Sterbini. The show is adapted
from Pierre Beaumarchais’ play “Le
Barbier de Séville” and is the prequel
to Mozart’s “The Marriage ofFigaro.”
“The Barber of Seville” ﬂopped when
it premiered in the early 1800s, but
has since transcended its infamy to
become one of NorthAmerica’s most
frequently performed operas.

Baritone Dan Kempson stars as
the jack of all trades Figaro in the stu-
dent matinee. Duringhis nine years of
formal operatic training, Kempson
studied at the Manhattan School of
Music andjuilliard.

“[Figaro] is someone who gets
things done anyway he can, whether
it’s withhis charm or deceit. I certainly
wish that I was a little bit of a joker
like Figaro, but I don’t think I have all
the tricks of the trade that he does,”
Kempson said.

— Kempson said he engages in a
lengthy warm-up ritual to prepare
hirnselfvocally and mentally for each
performance, referring to himselfas
a “creature of habit.” Out of all his
rituals, he emphasizes his need for a
tasty bowl of soup on the day of each

show.

This sort of familiar routine is a
necessary comfortinsuchanunorth-
odox production. Fans of the perfor-
mance might recognize anexceptional
level of grit and raw emotion — attrib-
utable, ﬁrstand foremost,.tothe work
of directorA. ScottParry, set designer
Allen Moyer, costume designerjames
Scott and the rest ofthe technicalteam
behind the curtain.

“There’s not just abunch of smiles
and dancing and happy faces. We take
these characters to be more than just
cartoons, more than just caricatures
of how they were written down on
the page. They are treated as people
with diverse personalities,” Kempson
said. I .
Pittsburgh Opera is holdingan an-

nual event in conjunction with this
production to enhance the Spanish
ambiance. The 56th Diamond Horse-
shoe Ball, titled “A Night in Seville,”
will be held on Oct. 9 in the Westin
Convention Center ballroom to cel-
ebrate the show’s opening.

The black-tie affairwill cuhninate
in an Opera Blast party immediately
following the performance.

In a culurre where operatic trag-
edies like “Aida,” “Carmen” and “La
Bohéme” reign.supreme,the.comedy
”The Barber of Seville” stands apart.

“These are classics of avant-garde

ﬁlmandthisisoneofthefewtimes _

that people can see these prints the
way they are meant to be shown,” he
said.

Amanda Doman, the departrnen-
talassistantfor contemporaryartand
organizer oftheﬁlmscreenings, said
selecting the ﬁlms from the archive
of nearly 200 ﬁlms and videos was
a process of “narrowing it down to
ﬁlms that ﬁt with the exhibit and
that seemed to resonate with each
other.”

Some of these ﬁlms can be found 5

online or seen at art-house cinemas, _

but others in the museum’s archives
are difficult to ﬁnd anywhere.
Doman echoed Byers’ sentiments
on the unusual properties of ﬁlm as
an art form, stating that “Film is this
medium that reﬂects our perception
of reality and can manipulate that

perception in a way that other art‘

media can’t.

“In contrast to the cohesive illu-
sory reality presented in aHollywood
feature ﬁlm, these experimentalﬁlms
are about dismantling that illusion
and the ideologies hidden within i ”

A related exhibit will be on dis-

Dan Byers:

play concurrently with “Ordinary
Madness” in the Forum Gallery, ex-
ploring the works of the enigmatic
artistjames Lee Byars. CuratorByers
described the pieces as “minimalist
sculpture-esque but with a spiritual
undercurrentto them. They’re about
‘a perfect moment or perfect geom-

etry.” I .

art —— fragments of letters sent on
different postcards, poetry written
on cash-register paper, mundane lo-

gistical detailsinscribed onjapanese

circles or hearts —willbe on display

as well. “It’s hard sometimes to get‘

your head out of glass and go to mu-
seums,” Byers said. “This is a really
good opportunity to see alot of really
interesting contemporary art, and I
would encourage as many students to
come see the show as possible.”

Pitt club team to

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Take Fifth Avenue Downtown. Merge
onto Interstate 579 North. Exit onto
Route 28 North, and take that for 11

' miles or so.

Congratulations, you have
reached Harmarville, home to 1,200
Pennsylvanians — and the Pitt club
hockey team.

Ifyou want to watch Pitt hockey,

you have to make this 25-minute

drive out to BladeRurmers Ice Com-
plex. And if you want to play Pitt
hockey, you have to do it at 10 p.m.,
twice a week, and get there in time
for practice.

Many members of the Pitt com-
munity haven’t attended a Panthers
hockey game. Many others don’t
know of the program’s existence.

“A lot of students might not even
know we have a team,” goaltender

A Mike Whitney said.

This Sunday afternoon, though,

play in new arena Sunday

Pitt hockeywill come closer to cam-
pus when the Panthers play Robert
Morris at the freshly coronated Con-
sol Energr Center as part of the RMU
Hockey Showcase. '

Sunday marks the event’s ﬁfth
year, but this will be the ﬁrst time
the Panthers panicipate. According
to head coach Tom Rieck, Robert
Morris contacted Pitt after its usual
opponent, Washington &Jeﬁ'erson,
dropped out.

“Obviously, we said yes,” Rieck

said. “And [we] did so very quick-
ly.” c

Pitt hockey operates as a club,
or nonvarsity, program. Club teams
function outside the University’s ath-
letic department, the players cover
some of the program’s costs and the
staff hold other full—time jobs. Pitt
lacks a Division I hockey program,
so the club team serves as an outlet
for anyone interested in playing the
sport. -

“Being labeled as a club sport

doesn’t really provide an appropri-
ate title,” sophomore forward Mike
McCurdy said. “We practice several
times aweek after 10 p.rn. and have to
travel at least 20 minutes to practice
and play. Also, the players get no free
weekends from September all the
way through March due to games.”

Since Pitt’s home rink is in Har-
marville, transportation obstacles
and odd practice times push the com-
mitment beyond that of a typical on-
campus club sport.

are in —— but they’re in no position to challenge
for the title.

Cincinnati — The Bearcats slashed through
Miami (Ohio) last weekas expected, anditseerns

like their team is ﬁnally pulling it together. But '

they — like a certain team from Western Penn-
sylvania — had a chanceto impress intheir non-
conference schedule and just were not up to the

task. Quarterback Zach Collaros is dangerous, '

but Cincimrati is goingto haveto putfull games
togetheragainstdecent opponents iftheBearca1:s
are going to challenge, which is something they
haven’t done yet this season.

Connecticut —— The Huskies ﬁnally looked

like the team everyone thought they would be at
the beginning of the season. Then theywent and
letatruefreshmanpass alloverthem. Thisteamis
havingaheckofan inconsistentseason, andcoach

RandyEdsallbeti:ergethisteamback ontrackf
- They have the talent to win a conference title but

have zero margin for error from here on out.
Louisville—The Cardinals have agoodquar-
terback-rumring back duo in Adam Froman and
Bilal Powell and have already won more games
thanlpredictedtheywould atthebeginningofthe
year. Coach Charlie Stronghashisteamprepared
everyweek, andthis lookslikeateamback onthe
rise after several years in the Big East basement.
They don’thave the talenttowinthisyear, butthey
could pull a surprise or two down the line.
Pittsburgh —— This has truly been a disap-
pointingyearfor the Panthers thus far. Losingall
three big nonconference games was not good,
and the blame falls all around — quarterback,

head coach, offensive line, injuries, oil‘-the—ﬁeld‘

distractions and eventoo much mediahype. Notre
Dame controlled much of the game lastweekend
and miraculously Pitt still found itselfin position
to possiblywinthe game. Coachinglapses — spe-
ciﬁcally with play-calling and time management
—tookthe greatestblame inthe loss, butthep1ay-
ers themselves had several chances and couldrft

T. NlC3HTS 

come through. They have the talent to win the
conference, but they are greatly underachieving
and could very well loseto a gutsy Syracuse team
this week.

South Florida — Skip Holtz has to pick his
team up. They just lost to Syracuse for the ﬁrst
time everandhadto playwestvirginialastnight.
Since the Big East adopted its current format in
2005, South Florida has been the only team in
the conference thathas awinningrecord against
WVU,butI dorftthinkthis istheiryear. Notwith
B.J. Daniels playing like he is, anyway.

Hereisthe players-of—the-yearrace, asit stands
at rnidseason.

Offensive Player of the Year: Rurming back

Hockey 4 8

Players carpool to practices that run until
nearly midnight.

“It’s tough at times to get everyone to prac-
tice since only halfthe team has a car, but we
usually ﬁnd away,” Watson said. “Practice times
are the other downfall. We practice late at night
due to players having late classes and that being
the only ice slot available at the rink. It’s a quick
turnaround for those that have early morning
classes, but late night practice is something
we have all been doing now for most of our
hockey careers.”

For a team accustomed to BladeRurmers
Ice Complex, the Consol Energy Center marks
— by far — the program’s biggest stage since
Rieck joined the program in 2000.

“I’ve played small pickup games at the Mel-
lon Arenawhere there were ﬁve fans watching,”
Watson said. “I can only imagine whatitwillbe
like to play in front of a crowded Consol Energy
Center. Gettingachance to play senioryear at a
new state-of—the-art arena against a rival team
— I don’t think the stage gets any bigger.”

Pitt, a member of the American Collegiate
Hockey Association, plays the Robert Morris
club team at 3 pm. The game lies in the mid-
dle of a triple—header that features the Robert
Morris wom_en’s team against Northeastern
at noon and itsgmen’s NCAA Division I team
against Air Force at 6 p.m. Rieck said that the
time slot should expose his team toa lot of
hockey fans. '

Whitney said he wishes Pitt had a rink on
campus, as it would make the team more ac-
cessible. But expanding into Oakland — and

Panthers to play Robert ‘Morris

into Division I hockey — takes money and land
that, as of right now, doesn’t_exist.

“I don’t think it will be in the near future
unless a wealthy alum decides to donate a lot
of money to get it going,” Rieck said.

Penn State received an $88—million dona-
tion last month to establish Division I men’s
and women’s ice hockey programs.

Still, according to Watson, who leads the
team with seven points in ﬁve games, Pitt
hockey is on the rise. g

“[Every year] we get a good group of fresh-
man that comes into the program,” Watson

‘ said. “Unfortunately it’s tough to get the mil-

lions of dollars donated like Penn State that
turned its program into a D—I NCAA hockey
team, but Pitt hockey is deﬁnitely growing.”
Rieck said 60 to 75 students typically try
out for the program, which ﬁelds a Division II
club.team as well. . ’
Pitt and Duquesne will play basketball

. Downtown for the second year in a row, and
the Consol Energy Center has a Panthers locker .
‘ room, but Rieck doesn’t know if the game Sun- ’ ~

day will start a tradition. Ultimately, Robert
Morris organizes the event.

Even so, Watson said Sunday presents an
opportunity for his program, Robert Morris’
program, and the conference.

“It’s ayearly thing that [Robert Morris’ D—I

team] gets to play a game at Mellon Arena or

the Consol Energy Center,” he said. “It would
be good opportunity for [Pitt, Robert Morris
and the ACHA] if we could be a part of that
every year.”
