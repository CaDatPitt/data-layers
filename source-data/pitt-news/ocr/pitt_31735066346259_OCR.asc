Pepi Club Replaces
Defunct Block ‘P.’

Major Groups  

Join F or Action

By JUDY NIEISLIK

Although Block P is gone,

school spirit is still at the Uni-. 0

versity in the form of the Pep

for Pitt Committee, sponsored by.
 Student Government. ~

The club was formed when en-
thusiasm among the leaders of
Block P waned after the Penn

’ State ﬁasco last year and the

general lack of student support
for such an activity occurred

4* throughout the year.

BLOCK P and its colorful half-time card tricks will be missing
from future Panther home games. Lack of student enthusiasm and
support resulted in the disappearance of the once popular activity.
In its place, a new “Pep Club” has been formed.

SG Discusses Book Exchange,  
Fills Vacant Senate Positions

The Student Government an-
nounced at its meeting last Mon-
day the result of this trimester’s

'Book Exchange and selected can-

didates for the empty seats on the
senate.

In a report given by Jay Fin-
geret, head of the Book Exchange
Committeegit was announced that
a net proﬁt of $160 was made this
trimester. .

Although problems were en-
countered by the change in the
courses, the exchange manage
to sell 638 books out of the M100
collected.

900 Extra Students Enroll; Total Nears 3,000

cause of the shortage of certain

Languages End Instructor Shortage

By BARRY GROSS

An unexpected 900 extra stu-
dents enrolled in the department

of languages, causing the short-

age of instructors for the ﬁrst
two weeks of the term. Enroll-
ment in this department totaled

3000.

Jack Kolbert, head of the De-
partment of Modern. Languages,
said that the shortage existed un-
til Monday. Instructors were re-

cruited from Chatham College,

Carnegie Tech, the Pittsburgh
Public Schools, and graduate
students at the University.
Many students went to language
classes for the ﬁrst two weeks
only to hear a secretary tell them

 
 
 

to keep coming, until a teacher
showed up.
Gives Reasons
“One reason for the enroll-
ment increase is that advisors are

bearing down on students, urging
them to begin required language
studies in the freshman year in-
stead of waiting till the senior
year where ﬂunking a class
would mean delaying graduation,”
Kolbert said.

Many non language majors,
who are majoring in subjects
such as history or political sci-
ence have decided that extra
work in the language of the

country they are especially in-

 

terested in would be beneﬁcial
to them.

A reverse situation exists in
the Chinese Department. There
are two top instructors, but not
enough students. Kolbert feels
that as more students become
aware of the scope and caliber of
the Chinese Department, that sit-
uation wil remedy itself.

French in First Place

A shift in the popularity of the
various languages has also taken
place. The most popular language
used to be German, folowed by
French and Spanish. Now, how-
ever, French is the most popular
language, followed by Spanish

demand books that as many as 200
students were turned away.

It was estimated that approxi-
mately $2200 dollars were col-
lected during the weeks of opera-
tion.

On September 11 and 12 the
money and books were to be re-
turned but $500 dollars have yet
to be distributed. SG has arranged
for the remainder to be returned
today and tomorrow between 12
and 12:50 in 325 SU.

The SU also then opened
nominations for the senate posi-
tions which are vacant due to
resignations and transfers. The
positions of junior senator, soph-
omore senator, and School of
Education senator remain open.

Carol Montgomery and Larry
Sherman were nominated for jun-
ior senators. The nominees for
sophomore senator is Joseph Sei-

' ger.

SG decided to keep nominations

open to allow all those interested
to be listed on the slate.
. Also included in the recommen-
dations was the suggestion that
Men’s Council keep the Christmas
Dance a formal dance instead of
the semi-formal affair that was
planned.

There‘ will be a meeting
Thursday at noon of the Pitt
News Business Staff in 415 SU.
All present members of the staff
are urged to attend. Anyone
who wishes to join the Business
Staff also may attend the meet-

lllg. '

At the-end of the football sea-
son there was an attempt to keep
the group going, but the remain-
ing members of the steering com-
mittee felt that without student
support Block P could not sur-
Vl\/’€.

Suggestion Tabled
The suggestion for a pep com-

 mittee was tabled until this\tri-

mester when itgwas felt that the
spirit of the students would gen-
erate a need for such a group it-

‘ there was spirit left.

Men’s Council took the ini-
tiative this trimester and noti-
ﬁed all student organizations
of its desire to begin the for-
mation of an organized spirit
leader.

SG resumed the responsibility’

and provided an organized pep
club for the outing at Camp
Kiski.

This program proved so suc-
cessful that a full time Pep For
Pitt Committee was established
under the leadership of Ruth Mc-
Guire to attempt to organize the
spirit and allow it to generate
spirit among the upperclassmen.

Activities Represented

Although this pep club is still
in the organizational stage it
shows the promise of being the
well-co-ordinated activty that the
past organization lacked, accord-
ing to Miss McGuire.

There is a. representative
from all the major activties on

Man age:1'11e,n.t

  Searches For
Classic Books

University Book Store is continu-

ing its efforts to obtain at a rea- 

sonable price for students other-
wise unobtainable material.

, The special purpose oi‘ the Fine
‘ Books Room, according to Paul R.

Boltacz, General Manager of the
University Book Stores, is to “cre-

‘ ate an awareness of the books
which are to be rated as classics or

near classics in content, binding,
and illustration.”
“Whether the books are esoteric

instead of exoteric is of no im-

portance” continued Soltacz. “We
seek, to move into the hands of the
students those books which he will

fuI'timatel.y want to place in his

own. private library.”

‘ The ‘Fine Books Room has also
sought to divorce its facilities
from the commercial part of the
bookstore so that the “contem-
plative process is possible.”

A sort of “gent1eman’s club” at-
mosphere complete with comfort-
able cushioned chairs and fire-
place has been developed to “en-
courage habits ‘for reading these
fine books.”

Although the Fine Books Room

has not been a complete “financial

success” it is still fulﬁlling its

main job to promote literary merit.
“Books were never intended
to be commercial bait for stu-

' dents” commented’ Boltacz “and

whether these books are trans-
lated into proﬁtable sales is of
minor or little importance.”

The Fine Books Room is at
present in a stage of transition.
The bulk of paper-back books
havealready been taken out of the

~.room and the Book Store is now
seeking to integrate books from it

the university presses by subject
mater with those from the trade
publications.

 Enroll

In Languages

(Continued from Page I)
and then German.
The new Liberal Arts curri-
culum gives no -credit for the

, first year of a language, with

the exception of Chinese and
Russian. (Therefore, students
continue with the language they
learned in high school in order
not to take the ﬁrst year of a
new language.) Spanish and
French are the most popular
languages in high schools.

Another enrollment problem
concerns special classes oﬁered
by the language department such
as those on Docstoyevsky . and
Tolstoy.

For example, only seven stu-
dents showed up for the class on
Doestoyevsky. M‘ 0 st students
thought the course was given In
Russian. Advertising that classes
of this type are given in English

should increase their enrollment.

But students and advisers are
not responsible for all the depart-
ment's problems. One professor
from France who was to teach
here this year recently discovered
that his visa was not going to be

’ extended.

 Pitt Proﬁle: Dr. Roy Heuth,ICounseling Director

Heath Spurns Scholarly Conformity ,

By NORMAN BUKSBAUM

Is the creative individual, the

natural scholar, being swallowed
up into conformity by our mass
educational system? “No,” says
Dr. Roy Heath, Director of the
University ‘Counseling, Service.
Dr. Heath is dedicated to the
idea that provisions must be made
to guide the higher intellect in his

’pursuit of knowledge. It was to

.,..

'v-I

 

this end that Dr. Heath establish-
ed the Counseling Center in 1956.

’ ‘The Counseling Center exists

for those students who feel they
have certain problems and would
like to talk them _over with
someone who canunderstand and
help them. The staff consists of
three men: Dr. Heath, Dr. Warren
Hill, and Dr. John Stone.
Watch Proteges

In an article‘ entitled, “Our Po- i

tential Scholars -- A University
Plan,” Dr. Heath maintains, “The
growth of potential teachers and
scholars has long occupied a spe-
cial place' of interest among our
colleagues in higher education.

“Aside from personal satis-
factionwe may derive from se-
lecting our successors, the de-
velopment of a new generation
of instructors is imperative to
the survival of our colleges and
universities.”

With this goal in mind, the
staff , of the Counseling Center
maintains a constant watch on
the progress of students selected
for their unusual intellect.

The name of a student exhibi-
ting mental, acuity of a creative
nature may be; submitted by one

of his teachersto Dr. Heath and’

his staff. ‘He then becomes a
“ward’ ’of the Counseling Center
and receives all possible aid and
guidance in fulfilling his educa-
tional aspirations.
Chairman of Committees

In addition to his work in the
Counseling Center, Dr. Heath is
the chairman of the Special Fel-
lowship Committee and the chair-

on. nor HEATH. Director of the University Counseling Service,

 
 

dedicates himself “to the idea that provisions must be made to
guide the higher intellect in his pursuit of knowledge.” Dr. Heath

man of the Rhoades and Fulbright
Committees at the University.
As national representative for
the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship,
Dr. Heath spends two months a
year travelling to other universi-

and other systems to aid’ the bet-

ter students. Last year Dr.
Heath visited over 75 universi-
ties.

Dr. Heath is deeply concerned
that transfer students may slip
through the “screening” process
without being noticed by his
teachers. He is intent on establish-
ing a system in which no one will
be overlooked.

of Pennsylvania where he receiv-
ed his Ph.D.

Serving Princeton in 1954 as
an instructor in psychology, Dr.
Heath joined the faculty of
Knox College, in Illinois, as as-
sistant professor of psychology.

It was at Knox that Dr. Heath

met Dr. Charles Peake, the pre-
sent Vice Chancellor for Academic
Disciplines. In 1956 the two men
came to the University, where Dr.

New Graduate Library School
To Open During F all of 1962

, By DREW HARVEY

The 12th professional school of
the University, the Graduate
School of Library Science, is

‘scheduled to open in the fall of

1962.

This school will train librarians
for the Western Pennsylvania
Area, surrently plagued by a
shortage of trained librarians.

According to a statement made
by Dr. Edward H. Litchﬁeld, “the
school will fill an outstanding
need both in the nation and in
the state. At present, there are
an estimated 18,000 openings in
the nation’s 62,000 libraries.

“The need is for 1,250 quali-

ﬁed librarians, yet only 50 per-
sons a year are graduated for
public library service in Pennsyl-
Vania.”
More Libraries Urged
“Both the American Asociation
of School Libraries and the
Pennsylvania State Department
of Public Instruction are urging
the establishment of libraries in
elementary schools.” ‘
Chancellor Litchﬁeld added
that the increased demand for
trained librarians will continue
to grow and “will give rise to
even more alarming shortages
of trained personnel than al-
ready exist.”
The new school, which is sup-

ported by state aid, will become
the only graduate school in this
area devoted solely to library sci-
ence. Previously such service was
provided by the Oarnegie Library
School, which was supported by
Carnegie Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Discontinue Support «

Last year, however, these or-
ganizations discontinued their
support of the Library School.
James M. Bovard, president of
Carnegie Institute proposed to
Governor David L. Lawrence that,
if Pitt opened a school, the In-
stitute “would gladly make its
records, experience, and some
equipment of the present school
available, and will help in any
way possible in promotingits de-
velopment and activities in the
community."

For the time being at least,
the new school will make its
home in the Cathedral. The
school will move to new quar-

ters in the Hillman Library
which will be ocnstructed
across Forbes St. from the

Schenley Quadrangle.

‘The Graduate School of Library
Science will enable the University
to join the ranks of Columbia
University, the University of Chi-
cago, and others who already

have programs in this ﬁeld.

Block P, designedfor the collective expressions-of school
sp__irit, has been dissolved, but few tears marked its pass-

i -ing. And for good reason.

; The purpose of a flashcard section at any'University
football game is-not only to present a halftime showpiece,
but also to demonstrate an organized -system of chee.ring
which requires the co-operation of every ‘student in the

, section to -make it work. It’s not a pushy rah—rah type of
attitude where any kin-d of noise is acceptable, buta more

sophisticated attempt to display the students’ feelings by
producing something original.

In past year, however, these ideas have been lost to
the Block. Adherents for its revival today contend that

' Block P creates school spirit rather than expresses it.

Last year’s demonstration at the Penn State game dis-
proves such a theory. Whilea number of reasons prompted
the display, the fact of Block P had little to do with the
disastrous outcome. It¥neither ‘created nor prevented the
event,'but merely set the scene and provided the equipment.

~.AnotherV argument advanced by Block P supporters
deals with unity. By keeping many rooters in a roped-off
area, cheerleaders are better able to lead the group in
‘cheers.

But again, past experience demonstrates the fallacy

‘of such thinking.’The creation of an opposing Block E, in-

vented by.the'engineers last season, hardly exuded a spirit
of unity among cheering students. If anything, the cheer-
leaders were more exhausted at the end of the game ignor-
ing the catcalls of the so-called rooters than leading Block
P fans in any organized cheers.

From all,app’earances, organized cheering cannot exist,
but this year’s~pictures does not look" as black_ as supposed.
The establishment of a Pep for Pitt Committee promises to
fulﬁll a function long forgotten in the tradition of Block P.
By avoiding any frantic attempts to reorganize without re-

‘A examining, the Pep Committee has given itself enough time

to start the long process of reorienting students as to the
purpose of school spirit on campus and how it can be ex-
pressed more effectively.

The program is a slow one, but with any degree of
continuity, it can return true enthusiasm to the campus, in
‘the form of‘a*spi_rited”Block P.

-. proximately eight thousand years: a betrothal so

lengthy that it seemingly justiﬁes thequestion: “So
what?” V ‘ .
So here's what. This time itlooks as if we are
headed for an atomic shot—gun
wedding. . k “
But before the leading na-
of the world exchange
vows to destroy each other,‘ an
examination of the cause lead-
ing up to such an earth-breaking ‘
event is in order. I
The main problem, as anyv
political analyst will point out, is -
the difficulty of communication
between nations. Each country,
for some inexplicable reason, .
wags _a foreigndtongue, thereby creating misunder-
standings, mistrusts, mistreatments, miscalcula-
tions, misdemeanors and, ultimately, missiles.

Logicol, and Nice

An attempt has been made in thepast to elimi-
nate the communication barrier’ between nations by
teaching people foreign .languages in colleges. Not
only is this logical, but it is nice, too. But Ameri-
can institutions of higher learning have not done
a thorough job.

,At this University, for example, languages of
countries from all the corners of the world may be
studied. Granted that there are few corners on any
globe, but still, one corner has been missed. That
corner contains one of the Big Four powers; one of
the most inﬂuential foreign countries in the world

.today, and a land with which our heritage and

history is ﬁrmly connected.

A Britich Language Department must be estab-
lished at the University of Pittsburgh.

Great Britain squats on the far side of the At-
lantic, praying to be our ally, straining to link arms

_in_ comradeship-with us, yearning to support our

ideology, striving to rid -itself of our Polaris sub-
marines, and we —— the leaders of tomorrow — will
not be able to understand the British people be-

cause we are not given. the opportunity to learn
their language. S '
Surrounded _ V pp
Aside from being important as "a political and
military ally, Great Britain is a fascinatingly _e-xiot
land. A closely knit group of islands, Great Brit
is surrounded on three sides by water and on: on
side by channel swimmers. Since the sun never
sets on ‘the — British Empire, the countryside
shimmers in perpetual daylight. This, of course,
is quite harmful to the eyes and is. the cause of we
peculiar discomfort which the natives refer to as
“that no good blinkin’ disease.” But having put
the old English to’ the problem, the patriarchshave

inventively discovered that by brewing tea in the“

plentiful ocean water, the pain is assuaged. Thus-
the agedprescription: “Take Tea and Sea.”

And in addition to being experts in ﬁeld-ex,-
pediency medicine, the British are among the
world’s foremost artists. Every Britisher -—— man,

woman and child -— paints wherever and whenever‘.
he can. In‘deed,'the ancient Britons are noted’ for’

painting themselves blue in the face.

These islanders are also culinary artists, as well.’
Someof their renowned edibles are English umuf-I V

ﬁns, Irish stew, English toﬁee, Welsh Rarebit,
Scotch Scotch and British Honduras.
Great Great Great -

It is this colorful culture which -makes Great

Britain a great Britain. And beingpgreat, we__ must: I
become more closely associated with the islands. 

That's ‘the American way.

But, to get back to the original premise, we
must learn the language in order to cement rela-
tions. This is a difficult task, of course. It would
entail. ﬁnding afacu-lty which could cope with such
problems as teaching students to place “u’s” in
“color,” to drop the “h” from such words as
“hiatus,” “horripilation,” and “H-Bomb,”fas well as
catching the true beauty of such words as “crum-
pet” and “Neville Chamberlain.” .

These difficulties can be -overcome if the com-
bined efforts of student body and administration
are utilized to their fullest extent- Then,- and only

, then, can the British language become a part of

our curriculum. And the road to international
understanding will be opened. And the path to
peace will be cleared. 

And wouldn’t exam-s be easy?

Columnist Bryant Hit

The recent blast at the female

who feel it is their turn totake,
a swing at the fellows“.

last week

First of all, the horrible mop-

picted, it must be cstablislied,
are in the minority at Pitt, and
are looked upon by other strict-
ly—feminine students with equal»
distaste. Mr. Bryant's amusing
“Brigitte,” “flirt,” and “rhino”
types compose only a small per-
cent of the skirt-wearing crowd.

And speaking" of skirts, the
claim that the male population
is disgusted with the rash of
extra-long skirts appearing on

able evidence,- invalid. Masculine

ONCE MORE, UNTO THE BREACH

\‘Vith this installment I begin my eighth year of writing columns
for the makers of Marlboro (3iga.ret.tes, as fine a bunch of men
as you would meet in a month of Sundays ——loyal, true, "robust,
windswept, fort.hright., tatt.ooed—in short, precisely the kind
of men you would expect them to be if you were familiar with
the ciga1'ett4es they make—-and I hope you are-—l’or Marlboro,
like its makers, is loyal, true, robust, windswept, forthright,
tzxlvtooed. ,

There is, however, one important difference between Marl-
boro and its makers. Marlboro has a filter and the makers do
not-except of course for Windswept T. Sig:il‘oos, Vice President
in cha.rge'of Media Research. Mr. Sigafoos does have a ﬁlter.
I don’t mean» that Mr. Sigafoos pexrsonally has a ﬁlter. What I
niean is that he has a ﬁlter in his swimming pool at his home in
]7airbanks, Alaska. You might think that ]“airbanks is rather
an odd place for M 1'. Sigal’oos't.o live, being such a long distance

 

«sis

from the Marlboro home ofhce in New York City. But it should
be pointed out that Mr. Sigaloos is not required to be at work”
until 10 A.l\-l.

But I digress. This column, I say, will take up questions of
burning interest to the aca(.lemic world-—like “Should lﬁ‘1'cnch
conversation classes be comluctcd in l:Englisli‘?” and “.\‘hould
students be allowed to attend ﬁrst hour classes in pajamas and
robes?” and “Can a student of 18 ﬁnd lmppiness with an eco-
nomics iprofessor of 9()‘.”’

Because many of you are new to college, especially freslnnen,
pcrhaps it would be well in this opening column to start with
campus fundamentals. What, for example, does “Alma l\‘latc1"3
nican? VVell, sir, “Alnia l\lat(+1"’ is "Latin for “send monc_\"’. 7

What does “.l)ean” mean? Well, sir, “Dean” is Latin for
.“d(m't get catiglit”.

What does “dormitory” mean? Well, sir, “dormitory” in
Latin for “bed of pain”.

Next, let us discuss student—te-aclier relationships. In college
the keynote of the relatkmship ‘between student and teaclier in
informality. When you meet a teacher on campus, you need
not salute. Simply tug your forelock. If you are bald and have

‘no forelock, a low curt-sey will suffice. In no circumstances

should you polish a teaclier's car or sponge and press his suit.
It is, however, permissible to worm his dog.

With the Presi<.le.nt of the I'niversity, of course, your relation--
ship will be a bit more formal. When you encounter the Presi-
dent, ﬂing yourself prone on the sidewalk and sing loudly;

“Pre.v_2/ is wis-e
P/‘mtg is l:/"ue
Pr'mr;/ has ()3/es
Of Lake Louise bIm>.”

As you can see, the l’resident of the I.'niversit_v is called
“l’rcx_v". Similarl_v, Deans are called “Dixie”. Professors are
(*-alled “l’roxie"'. HO‘ll.'_-=(*.l'll()lll(‘l'S are called “Hoxie Moxie".

Cats ‘Bone-Up’ On

There were some forty Pitt
students who wanted to sleep
“just a little while longer”
than the other six thousand
who wish the same on every

Monday morning‘ the other

day. These were the Panther foot-
ball players who had been robbed
oiltheir energy by the Miami Hur-
ricanes and the Miami night 0

,But they trudged onward to
classes, and later onto the prac-
tice ﬁeld across from the Field
House. The casual observer rea-
sons that “they ought to get at
least one day off” because the next
game is not until two more weeks.
Well, John Michelosen, their
taskmaster, wished that he had
about a month -more to prepare for
the home opener with the Baylor

Varsity cross-country, Carl
Rees, was encouraged by the
reading on his stop-watch
when four Panther harriers
recently ﬁnished a time trial
in a dead heat. The four run-
ners: Steve Waslo, Bob Tarkany,

.Bill Mocnik, and Larry Robinson

--were all timed in 24:18 over‘ the
4.3 mile Schenley Park course.
This’ time is more than thirty
seconds faster than Harry Stokes,
last year’s number-one Pitt run-
ner‘, was “able to achieve in the
1960 season opener in which the
Reesmen upset’ Slippery Rock.

-These four men, all of whom‘

take their cross-country seriously,

. should be’ closely bunched to-

gether at the conc1us‘ion of this
‘Saturday’s lid—lifter against the
same Rockets.

, _ Needs Fifth Man

Rees’ main concern,~however, is ,

that all of his other runners were
at least-a minute behindthe top
four. John »Towne and the sur-
prising Dick Cook ﬁnished ﬁfth
and sixth, respectively, but’ will
have to improve theirtimes if this

. year’’s' squad is to dotwell.

According to Rees, distance

trackman John Hart, who came
across the ﬁnish line after’ Cook,
should be able to do better. Bob
Henry, however, was ‘a disap-
pointment in the trial.
1 While the team is in "much
better shape” this year, the Pitt
mentor feels that it is not enough
unless hisﬁfth, sixth, and sev-
enth runners can improve on
their performances. Nevertheless,
with this year’s squad comprised
almost entirely of sophomores,
Rees has reasons to look opti-
mistically toward the future.

Safetyman Glenn Lehner fig-

many aerial threats in the Or-

too much.”

his boys will do a good job, this

In a scrimmage on Friday the at-1-G

Plenty of coaches thought Jock
was big enough as evidenced by
some 25 scholarship offers. Like
teammate, Fred Mazurek, Jock
chose Pitt because of its Medical
School. ‘ .

Beachler, 'Jock’s father, was

some of the glory to Pitt that his
namesake did.

A large blue board looms

over a double row of benches

in the Field House dressing room assigned to Pitt’s soccer

» On the board are listed -all eleven positions on the team.
Below each position, on small white cardboard discs, hang

thought on the college level for
Okoth (rhymes with =oh-moth),
because he has to maintain a strict
academic average.

“I wanted very badly to come
to the United States for college,”
says Okoth. “If I do not _do my
work well, I will. have to return
to my homeland.”

Has No Sub

And if that happens, Soccer
Coach Leo Bemis will have a
king—size headache. Hannington
has done the job so well in prac-
tice that Bemis»has shifted his
reserves away from the center
half position.

“Okie.” whose high school
team in Africa never lost a game‘
(“We bwere just too strong”),
distributes 195 pounds over a
lithe 6’4” frame.

This is Okoth’s first year of col-
lege soccer. So engrossed was he
in his studies last fall that he
'didn’t see or play any soccer at
all. But the beefed—up schedule
doesn’t scare Okie. “When I'hear
‘they were good last year’ it
doesn’t mean a thing. I see for
myself.”

Coached Own Team
Soccer is the national sport of
Kenya, and Hannington did most
of the coaching on his school
team.

“The average player over
here.” Says Okoth, “does not
have as much ball control as my
teammates in Kenya. American
soccer players do not work as.
hard at the game.”

Depth Lacking ~

Depth seems to be lacking, how-
ever, and an injury similar to
the, one that cut “Corky” down
in the first game of the season
last year could be very costly.
This is_“c_l0ubly true because of the
more difficult schedule the Bemis-

from the newly-instituted schol-
