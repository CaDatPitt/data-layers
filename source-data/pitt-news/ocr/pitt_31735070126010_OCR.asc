Students in Solidarity    

begins living wage
campaign at Eddie’s

A GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Students in Solidarity presented Sodexho Marriott
—- Pitt’s food service provider —— half of an award for social

c justice and human rights. —

SIS’s Living Wage Committee staged a rally Friday to
praise and criticize Sodexho for its actions pertaining to
human rights. The praise, according to Living Wage
Committee co—chair Paul Cooley, was for Sodexho’s “divest-
ment from the Corrections Corporation of America,” the

- United States’ largest operator of for-proﬁt prisons.

“Sodexho acknowledged that this change was because of
student pressure at this campus and at campuses across the
country,” Cooley, a junior, said in a prepared speech in front
of Sodexho’s offices near Eddie’s. ‘

Thehalf of the award that Sodexho did not receive was
for paying its workers a living wage, an action signaling the
official beginning SIS’s living wage campaign.

“This year we will be demandingthat the University pay
all of its employees, including all outsourced employees, a
living wage-of $9.12 an hour,” Cooley said.

Cooley explained that Sodexho will receive the other
half of the award when it pays all of its employees “a living
wage and treat them with the dignity deserving of their
essential role in the University community.” ‘

The rally began in the Towers lobby and proceeded
through Eddie’s as members of SIS handed out ﬂiers to stu-
dents’ and workers.

Vikram Kambampati, a first-year Pitt medical student,
delivered a speech to onlookers from atop a chair in Eddie’s.
‘He called Sodexho’s practices “economic oppression” and
“poor human relations” amidst applause from rally partici-
pants and shouts of “All right! Living wage!” from a cashier
who had left her post to watch thetprotest. -

“Too many -employees here _don’t even make enoug
money to buy the food they make; and serve,” Kambampati
said. “These hardworking people make sure we eat-, but can
barely afford to pay the bills at home.’-7 V r . I

The City of Pittsburgh’s Living Wage Ordinancedefmes
a living wage as $9.12 per'hour with health beneﬁts, based

' on‘ a study by Pitt’s Center for Social and Urban..Research in
.1997; . '1 "‘ I A

“Kambampati said that Pitt, as the largest employer in
Allegheny County, “has a moral ob1igatio_n...to pay its work-
ers a living wage before paying for new sports facilities,
bronze panthers or other campus beautiﬁcations.” - f

After the presentation of the half-award, the protester
exited onto Towers patio, chanting: “What do we want?
Living wage! When do we want it? Now!”

The rally is the first event of the Living wage
,Comrnittee’s campaign, which will continue throughout the
year. It follows similar living wage campaigns at universities

United Nations speaker discusses terrorism

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
StaffWriter

Finding Osama bin Laden may
only be half of bringing him to jus-
tice.

Extradition agreements and
national sovereignty were just two
of the topics addressed by t-he
Honorable Fausto Pocar in
Thursday’s 10th annual McLean
Lecture on World Law in the Pitt
Law Schoo1’s Teplitz Memorial
Court Room.

Pocar, who currently serves on
the United Nations International
Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, spoke about the devel-
opment of international law in
recent years, which he called “the
trend towards the establishment of
international criminal jurisdiction.”

“It’s a trend that is more and
more visible in recent years  that
the rule of law is essential in the
establishment of peace for future
generations.”

The lecture, sponsored by the
World Federalist Association of
Pittsburgh (WFAP), dealt with
obstacles that are often encountered
in bringing international criminals
to justice.

Martin J. Resick, the president
of the WFAP, introduced the lecture
by talking about its relevance to the
possible apprehension of Osama bin
Laden, especially if he is found in a
country with no extradition agree-
ment with the United States.

“What that country is going to
say then is: ‘How can we let you try
this person if you are the victim, the
judge, the jury and the execution-
er?”’ Resick said.

One of the main points covered
was the reason for the existence" of
international tribunals, which Pocar
said addressed “the need for addi-
tional guarantees of the enforce-
ment of international humanitarian
law.”

“Even in time of war, human
rights and humanitarian standards
overlap,” Pocar said. “The protec-
tion that is afforded in wartime
must be parallel to that in peace-
time.”

Dealing with war crimes and
high—level officials who commit
them is one of the many difficult
tasks that Pocar has dealt with in his
years of work at the United Nations.

“The higher the rank of the vio-
lator, the harder it is to prosecute
them in the country in which the

violation occurred,” Pocar said.
Pocar also spoke about the line
between national sovereignty and
international jurisdiction. 
5‘The current approach is to give
primacy to international court over
a domestic court,” Pocar said, but
followed up by stating the problems

he saw with that policy.

“A trial _at the place where the
crime was committed has an unde-
niable advantage in discovering the
truth,” he said.

Chancellor’s award
honors Pitt staff for
distinguished service

MARTY FLAHERTY
Staff Writer

When Kathleen Rud found out she
had been nominated for the Chancellor’s
Distinguished Service Award for Staff last
year, she was “really shocked.”

Jeffrey Liebmann, also nominated
last year, was similarly surprised. “Not
that many people evenknew what I was
doing,” he said. - ‘

Both Rud, who works in the ofﬁce of
the dean of the Faculty and College of
Arts and Sciences, and Liebmarm, who is
an academic planning ‘associate in the
Office of the Provost, were among the five
winners of the award last year.

Each year, there are up to ﬁve recipi-
ents of the award. Each receives $2,500
and has his or her name inscribed on a
plaque displayed in the ‘William Pitt
Union.

According to Robert Houston, chair-
man of the awards committee, the plaque
will be featured next to the three plaques
commemorating winners of each award:
the Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching’

Award, Research Award and Public

Service Award. -

1 Any full-time or part-time University
employee, excluding faculty, is eligible for
the award, provided they have been in ser-
vice for at least three years.

Employees at Pitt’s satellite campuses,
are also eligible for the award. In past
years, there has been a winner from the
Greensburg campus, as well as a nominee
from the J ohnstown campus.

Neither Rud nor 'Liebmann thought
that anyone had noticed their volunteer
eﬂorts prior to receiving the award.-

As Rud put it, “It’s not something I do
to be recognized by other people.”

Rud spent seven years volunteering as
an Emergency Medical Technician for the
Baldwin, Pa. Emergency Medical
Services, and volunteered at Pitt basket-
ball and football games and‘ commence-
ment.

She also volunteers for the Pitt AIDS

Task Force and at single events for many
other organizations, including the United
Way Day of Caring. 
“It’s what makes me feel good
inside,” Rud said. She said that she has “a ‘’
lot of people in this office volunteering
with me.”
Candidates for the award must: meet
a rigid set of guidelines, spelled out in a
letter from Chancellor Mark Nordenberg.
According to the letter, a_ candidate

.must display “service excellence in the

workplace,” as well as “a consistent pat-
tern of voluntary services of signiﬁcant
importance to the University community,
the local community, and/or professional ‘
organizations.”

The candidate must also have
“enhanced the reputation and prestige of '
the University of Pittsburgh regionally,
nationally, or intemationally.” A

“I consider that really part of my job
here,” Liebmarm said of his efforts meet-
ing these standards. .

Liebrnann volunteers as a youth advi-
sor at First Unitarian Church in Shadyside
and said he uses his-knowledge to train
other youth advisors throughout the.
United States.

He also uses his job skills to help
Woodland Hills School District with their
academic planning. , _

Liebmann said he feels that the award
program is important because it “helps
make staff more well-rounded,” and helps
them to “realize their full potential.” .

While Liebmann and Rud were both
nominated by -colleagues who work -in
their offices, nominations are open to all
members of the University community,
including students and alumni. '

According to Houston, the non1ina- S

tions come in slowly until just before the
deadline, which is Oct. 31 this year.
Nevertheless, Houston said, “We’ve '
always had a healthy pool to choose
from.” . _ _
Nominations can be picked up in the
Student Affairs office, located in Rm
130 of the Union. " W

campaigns, such as the one at Yale
University, were successful in increas-
ing pay for university "employees.

“We are here today to say that stu-
dents will no longer remain silent,”

for living wage D

Kambampati said.

“We’re just going to keep raising
awareness about living wage,” Cooley
said after the protest. “There’s workers

Peskie .said that she sent an e-mail to
Consumption Junction and told them
that she did not give permission to dis-
play the photograph and they would have
limited time to remove it before she
would take further action. Peskie said
she checked the Web site the following
day; and that her picture had been
removed.

Because Consumption Junction
posts over‘4,000 pictures, Peskie said
that there is a possibility that her picture
could still be buried deep within its photo
gallery. She would have to scroll through
thousands of /picture titles to know for
sure. -

“The jurisdiction is clear  I
do not think that there will be any

‘ pressure on the government of the

United States not to try [the terror-
ists] in the U.S.,” Pocar said, but
added that “the value of a decision
of an international tribunal may be
greater than that reached by, a
national court.” .

__Pocar alsoresponded to ques-

‘tions about the formulation of a tri-

bunal that would be responsible for
prosecution of the Taliban.

“I think it would be better to
have an international criminal tri-
bunal  but I would prefer to qual-
ify the crimes as crimes against
humanity and not as war crimes,”
.he said. T

Pocar added that the military
action of the United States “can be
qualified as self-defense,” reason-
ing that “self—defense requires that
the attack be linked to a state” and
that “the territory of [Afghanistan]
served as protection [for the terror-
ists].”

Pocar said. “You have a war and
not a war.”

Peskie said that he thought her original
copy must have been saved onto her pub-
lic directory by mistake. When they
opened her public directory, they found
Peskie posing topless in the unedited pic-
ture. .

Whether the original picture was
deliberately taken from Peskie’s comput-
er account without her knowledge or the
misplaced picture was the cause of acci-
dental human error in keystrokes, Peskie
said that she was not certain. “I didn’t
even know I had a public directory,” she

. said. '

Everyone with a University UNIX

account has a private and a public direc-
tory.
Unlike the private directory, anyone
with a University account can read and
list what is inside a public directory. It
works like a personal Web page.

Only the account owner can add or
alter the contents of their public directo-
ry. If that person changes the default set-
ting or gives out their login and pass-
word, other users will be able to add
something to that person’s public direc-
tory. .
Peskie said that she hasn’t changed
her public directory’s default and has
never given out her login and password.

“Even if the picture was accidentally

it’s strange that people would know to

also seemed suspicious to her that the ,

Fright, but not paranoia,
should be a part of Halloween

“Trick or treat!”

Wednesday night, we’ll hear children
saying this. Perhaps they’ll even knock
on the doors of students who live off-
campus.

But thanks to terrorism, anthrax
scares and paranoia, some places are can-
celing or discouraging trick-or-treating.

According to the Oct. 25 Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, Wilkinsburg Mayor
Wilbert Young canceled this Halloween
ritual two weeks ago and replaced it with
community parties, citing worries about
terrorist_ attacks and anthrax threats. He
has since reversed this decision.

But Wilkinsburg is not the only place
that expressed concern about safety.
According to Time magazine, Arkansas
Gov. Mike Huckabee, while not abolish-
ing trick-or-treating in the state, has asked
trick-or-treaters to attend other activities.
His reason: “We can’t handle the panic
that comes when a parent encounters a
broken Pixy Stick in a sack and thinks it
is anthrax.”

The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the
recent anthrax scares have put the United
States on edge. At the same time, our
leaders have told us repeatedly to carry
on with our normal lives. It should be no
different for Halloween.

Halloween is a quintessential part of

American life and lore. Although its 011'-
gins lie in Druid and Catholic holidays, it
has become a holiday with a great deal of
American pop-culture signiﬁcance.

This is not the first time there has
been urmecessary fright on Halloween.
For example, in the 1970s a Houston man
named Ronald O’Bryan laced his son’s
candy with cyanide. Because of this, ‘par-
ents learned to be more cautious. They
now inspect their children’s candy every
year, and adults tell their kids not to eat
any before their parents do this. But fears

‘that this might happen again in other

places did not end nick-or-treating, and
neither should the atmosphere of fear
after Sept. 11. A

Halloween this year should be no dif-
ferent than in years past. Vigilance, which
has reached a heightened level recently, is
already a normal part of Halloween.

Halloween should continue as
plarmed. Parents should follow the usual
safety measures, such as supervising their
children, inspecting their candy and mak-
ing sure they go only to homes they
know. .

But no one should be paranoid.
Halloween is a day for people of all ages
to have a good time, and officials should
not attempt to prevent this because of
unnecessary precaution.

America didn’t elect George W.

No, we didn’t choose Bush Jr.

aid to Afghanistan, mostly used for
dropping food rations over the
country.

Wow, that almost makes it seem
like we thought this whole bombing
Afghanistan thing through!

Of course, $324 million is a lot

for what he is, but for.
what he isn’t — namely,
Bill Clinton (or anyone
associated with him).
After nearly a year of
torturous reminders that

of money, an amount of
money that most of us
can’t fathom. In terms of
feeding starving people,
it doesn’t go very far.
Afghanistan is in the
middle of a_ three-year
drought, and according to
the World Food Prog.ram,

the wool over our eyes. ,
It seems like “compassionate con-
servative” actually means compas-
sionately running current events
through the spin cycle before airing
them out for the public.

5 Sound familiar? I’ll give you a
hint: “I did not have sexual rela-
tions with that woman.” Ah, yes. It
looks like Clinton gave Bush a
crash-course in spin control before
he opened up shop in Harlem.

The other day I turned on the
news to see Bush address a stage
full of kids, thanking them for their
$1 donations for therchildren of
Afghanistan. He then went on to
discuss the effort we are making to
attack the Taliban and "the Taliban‘
only. We -are not making civilians
the targets of our bombs, and more-
over, we pledged $324 million in

ter of the country’s popu-
lation — will be entirely
dependent on food aid to live.
Michael Albert and Stephen R.
Shalom of ZNet have done the math
and revealed that the money we
allocated would feed a starving
population of only 3 million for 25
days. And this is the best-case sce-
nario, assuming all of the money
went to paying for the food rations,
rather than including delivery’ costs,‘
and that every ration went_ to a
starving person, as opposed to land-.
ing in a military minefield. For 5.5
million people, it :wouldn’t even.

Compare this to the $40: billion  a

  Weekend full of surprises in college football

Another weekend of football is The Hokies were ‘defeated on spoiler. If the Hokies can defeat the

complete, and _ what a
weekend it was.

What better place to
start than right here at
Pitt? The Panthers finally
ended their five- game los-
ing streak and ' get their
first win against a
Division 1-A opponent
while on the road.

How did they do it? SPORTS VIEW

The answer is simple.
They went back to doing
what has worked best for

them. Walt Harris went

Saturday by Syracuse who
has come out of nowhere
to be near the top of the
Big East rankings.

This loss basically
ends all hope for the
Hokies’ national champi-
onship campaign. Since
they have such a weak
schedule-they will need a
miracle to make it to the
BCS.

However, Virginia
Tech will still have a

Miami.Hurricanes, they could poten-
tially keep the Hurricanes out of the
Rose Bowl as well.

A One of my favorites to play in the
Rose Bowl was defeated on Saturday.

The UCLA Bruins were handed their '
_ first loss by Stanford, 38-28. I really

thought that DeShaun Foster could
lead this team to a BCS bid. A run-
ning back can’t play defense too, so
the Bruins fell.

Two of the other undefeated
teams that fell were the Cinderella
squads. The Washington State

rity to the tops of the Pac-10, were
defeated 24-17 by the Oregon Ducks.
Thanks to the loss of UCLA and the
Ducks’ win, they put themselves right
back into the Pac-10 championship
race and improved their chances of
going to a BCS bowl.

The clock also struck midnight
for the Maryland Terrapins. To win
the ACC conference, you always have
to go through Florida State, and that
is where Maryland left their glass
slipper. Maryland scored a late touch-
down to tie the ‘game at 31 near the

chance to play the role of Cougars, who came from total obscu-
back to last year’s playbook and -
brought out all the old west—coast
style formations and plays. No more
shotgun, spread, or that no-huddle
confusion that plagued the Panthers
earlier this year. Instead, they ran a
lot more single back three wide
receiver sets and some “I” formation.
I feel the “I” formation is one that
the offense should have gone back to
a few weeks ago. Coming into the
season, the running back situation
was a big question, but the full back
position was not. Lousaka Polite was
the undisputed leader of the running _  j         .          ..              ,1, .      ..

In that offense, only one running
back would be on the field at the
time, which turned out to be '
Raymond Kirkley. The change into
using the “I” formation brings back
into the fold the Panthers’ most expe-
rienced running back and a superb

Polite leads offense, sets up two touchdowns

look down field and find a wide
open R3. English for a 46-yard gain
to begin the game.

Then four plays later, again out
of the “I” formation, Polite, the lead
blocker, opened up a huge hole for
running back Raymond Kirkley.
Kirkley, with a burst of speed, hit
the enormous hole for a 16-yard
gain down to the Temple 6—yard line
where Priestley would find Antonio
Bryant for a 6-yard«touchdown pass
to open up the scoring.

The- two key plays, a 46-yard

A

pass to English and a 16-yard run by
Kirkley, were both set up by Polite.

“I just have to stay strong and
play the same level every week,”
Polite said. “I have a lot more confi-
dence now. It has been a long six
weeks.”

On the Panthers’ fourth drive of
the game, Pitt rewarded Polite for
his efforts from earlier on_ in the
quarter. After a Temple penalty gave
Pitt a first and 10 from the Owls’
45-yard line, Priestley went back to
pass. This time, however, the
Temple blitz was on.

Polite immediately picked up

Truth Behind
the Terror      am

the blitz from the back field and
went rolling out to the-right with his
quarterback. Polite made a desper-
ate dive and tripped up a Temple
defender, opening up a split second

for Priestley to find English down-

field for a 21-yard gain.

The very next play, with Pitt out
of the I formation again, Polite led
Kirkley right down the heart of the
Owls’ defensive for a 13-yard run
down to the Temple 11-yard line.
After Bryant caught a 6-yard-pass
down to Temple’s 5-yard line,
Harris decided to bring in backup
quarterback Rod ' Rutherford.

However, Rutherford lined up as a
wide receiver, with Priestley still
the quarterback.

Priestley took the snap from
center and faked a handoff to
Rutherford, who continued to fake
running left. Priestley rolled out to
the right_ side and found a.wide open
Polite for a rewarding 5—yard touch-
down pass. On three separate plays,
Polite helped the Panthers take a
commanding 14-0 lead.

“I knew the defense would go go
[Rutherford],” Polite said. “Then I
got open on a naked boot.”

In the second half, with Pitt’

holding a commanding lead, Harris
took Polite out of the game to avoid
injuring his already ailing hamstring
and give him a good rest.sPolite set
up the only two offensive touch-
downs from the Panthers.‘

With Polite healthy once again,
the Panthers now have a triple threat

end'of the third quarter, but the

Seminoles finished the game off with‘
~ 21 unanswered points and cruised to

the 52-31 victory. f
The last undefeated team is the
BYU Cougars. I know they score a

lot of points and cover the spread.

basically every week, but a Mountain
West Conference team has no shot at
playing in a BCS bowl. Even if BYU
goes undefeated and wins every game
by 30 points, it just doesn’t matter. If

you want proof, see Tulane from a

few years ago.

Monday night on SportsCenter’

we will see where everyone stands in
terms of the new BCS rankings. Most

likely Nebraska and Miami will ‘be '

one and two, respectively, with a

"plethora of one-loss teams trailing

behind them.

Watch out for Texas and of .

course Oklahoma to be in the top five
and potentially have ,a shot at making

a national title appearance. But for’
now its Miami’s and Nebraska’s to ~

lose.

Tired of just reading the daily newspaper? Here’s your chance
to make news.

This fall, The Pitt News will offer a series of talks on how to do

actually making history by doing it for the University’s only
independent daily newspaper.

Applications will be available at each talk in case you like
what you hear and want to work for The Pitt News. Or just
stop by, learn a little, and talk with the people who already

edit and write thenewspaper.
