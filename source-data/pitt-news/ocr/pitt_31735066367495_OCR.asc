Code on Clothing

Set by Committee

A University code for Men and
Women’s dress on campus has been
drawn up by representatives from

‘Associated Women Students, Stu-

dent Union Board, Men’s Council
and Student Senate.

The following code was formu-
lated because “students themselves
are concerned about having better
dress on campus,” said one repre-
sentative. I

“Many outsiders visit the cam-
pus every ‘day and draw impres-
sions about the University from
the way Pitt students appear and
act. This code is for those few
students who refuse to used good
taste in their dress.”

In the classrooms and dining
areas (cafeteria and Tuck Shop)
school clothes must be worn at
all times. The committee “de-
ﬁnes school clothes as collared
shirts tucked in, dress or khaki
pants for men, and sweaters
blouses, skirts, or dresses for
women. Pin curls are not per-
mitted at any time.

In the libraries, Student Union,
and Hunt Room, school clothes
must be worn from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Monday through Friday and Sun-
days. Sports clothes may be worn
after 7 p.m. Monday through Fri-
day and all day Saturday.

For sports events and Student
Union dances school clothes should
be worn unless otherwise speci-
ﬁed. ‘

Teachers, librarians, proctors,
marshals, and other appointed per-
sonnel will enforce this code of
dress. Students failing to comply

with this policy will be asked to
leave the Cathedral or Student
Union affair for that particular oc-
casion.

  F.  I. Investigating
S U Painting

See editorial on page.

Theft

The F.B.I. is presently investigating the theft of an
original Picasso painting which‘ was taken from the SU
Lounge last weekend. The painting is valued at $100,000, ac-
cording to recent New York radio broadcasts by Lowell
Thomas. Others have estimated its value to be lower.

A recent law passed in Congress enables the F.B.I. to

investigate any case
$5000 or more to see if an inter-
state law has been violated.

Since the painting was stolen
in Pennsylvania, the F.B.I. will
have original jurisdiction only if
the painting is secured in another
state.

Offers Reward

Robert Reeves, Pittsburgh agent,
explained that if the painting is
recovered in Pennsylvania, the
F.B.l. will not be involved.

A $100 reward is being offered
by the University for informa-
tion leading to the recovery of
the painting‘.

The descriptionrof the painting
is: No. 541 Pablo Picasso, FIG-
URE—l9l8 Oil on Canvas, 13"/3 x
10%.

Information should be directed
to the attention of William H.
Cooper, director of the Student
Union, MA 1-3500, Ext. 7191.

Requests Help I

The painting, which was loaned
from the Guggenheim Foundation
of New York, was discovered
missing Sunday morning by Rich-
ard Dobbs, a graduate student and
dormitory counselor. s

Along with several‘ other val-
uable pieces of art, the painting
‘has been on display for the past
ﬁve months in the SU Lounge,
and was to be returned at the
end of this month.

“This display has brought much

‘pleasure to members of the Uni-

versity community. It is a shame
that such a regrettable thing has
happened,” Cooper said. “This is
the first time any painting has
been lost from the Guggenheim
collection, and it has been display-
ed in universities all over the
country.”

Dr. W.,L. Swartzbaugh, Dean of

involving-$

Students, has requested that the
thousands of persons who have
seen and appreciated the exhibits
held in the SU provide any as-
sistance they possibly can which
might lead to the recovery of the
painting.

Theatre Group

Party Platforms Announced

Merger . . .

.A merger between the Allied
Collegiate Party and the Interest
Deserves Energetic Action Party

was announced today by Richard‘

Rosenzweig, the presidential can-
didate ofthe combined slate.
iThe name of newly-formed
party will be the Allied Collegiate
Party, ACP. Ray Reaves will be
Rosenzweig’s running mate.
Speaking for the reorganized
ACP, Rosenzweig stated that
they believed the merger would
‘give impetus to the single pur-
pose of putting the Student Gov-
ernment into useful and signiﬁ-
cant operation.”

Hunter, the former IDEA presi-
dential candidate, said, “I am with-
drawing my proverbial hat from
the ring in order to support Dick
Rosenzweig whose aims coincide
with my own.”

Similarly, Pat Teeters felt, “I

— am enthusiastic about the merger,

and gladly step aside in favor of
Ray Reaves.” ‘P

ACP...

The new Allied Collegiate Par- _

ty, slating Richard Rosensweig
for president and Ray Reaves for
vice-president‘, has accepted as its
underlying principle the need for
a re—evaluation of, and increased
interest in, the existing Student
Government.

With this in mind the ACP sub-
mits its platform. We realize that
interest in student organizations
has, due to the increased speed
at which the trimester operates,
decreased. On this basis, a re-
evaluation of student government
is imperative. From this study a
creed will be developed which
will guide existing organizations
and serve as a foundation for fu-
ture organizations.

Our proposals are: We will
establish a leadership lab to pre-
pare freshmen and sophomores for
positions in campus organizations;
we will work with the existing
committee for student organiza-

.(Con.tim¢ed on Page 3)

At the same time that he re-
leased his party platform, presi-
dential candidate Robert Fulton,
-of the Students for Progressive
Action, announced that an’ open
party meeting will be held in 813
Cl._. noon Thursday.

‘There, students will be slated
and theparty platform and policy
will be discussed. The platform
reads as follows: I

“The rapid changes in the Uni-
versity in the last ﬁve years have
created new problems and con-
flicts which affect the student
body. I

Need Changes

“We, the members of Students
for Progressive Action, believe
that the Student Government has
a crucial role to play in oversee-
ing and encouraging the emerg-
ence of a uniﬁed" student body.
We feel that basic changes are
needed in the philosophies of these
major areas relative to student
affairs.

Informal Birdland Session

By JIM HUFNAGEL
(See picture on page 8)
For almost three hours Monday afternoon the Student
Union Lounge became another “Birdland” when two well-
known jazz groups staged an informal “jam session” for

University students.

The two combos, headed by Bob Negri and Ray Crum-
mie, provided the music for vocalist Lum Sams.

The Negri group featured Bobb--~

himself on the piano, Jim DiJulio
on bass, Henry Sciulo at the
drums, and Frank Lamark with
the tenor sax.

“Full Time Job”

When asked whether jazz is a
hobby of a profession with him,
Bob, who is the brother of Joe
Negri, the popular television gui-
tarist, replied, “For me music is
a full-time job. Today, wide-
spread public interest has made
jazz :1 better business than it ever
was before.” :

Ray Crummic’s group consist-
ed of Ray on piano, Spider
Rondi with the drums, and Carl
McVickers playing bass. The
Crummie combo has recently
appeared at the South Paciﬁc
Club.

Ray, a graduate of the Univer-
sity’s School of Engineering, has
been in the music business for 12
years.

In answer to a query about his
favorite jazz pianist, Crumrnie
cited Horace Silvers, head of a
New York jazz trio, as “the best
jazz pianist on the scene today.”

Students Comment

Lum Sams, guest vocalist for the
afternoon, used to sing with Ray’s
group. She is currently appearing

at the Point View Hotel.

Bob Alderisio, Arts Fr., said‘
of the jazz performance, “It was
very good, especially the vocal-
ist, Lum Sams.”

This sentiment was echoed by
Bruce Palmer, Arts Soph., who
went on to say that, “,the program
would probably have been better
attended if it had been held after
dinner.”

Dr. Amma Given

Research Award

A two year grant of $23,000 has
been awarded to Dr. Elmer L.
Amma, assistant professor of
chemistry. The grant, given to Dr.
Amma by the National Science
Foundation for research on the
polarization of ions, was an-
nounced by Dr. Alan T. Water-
man, director of the Foundation.

According to Dr. Amma, his re-
search on “Structure and Theory
of Metal-Ion-Aromatic Complex-
es” is essentially an effort to
achieve theoretical and experi-
mental understanding of bonding
tendencies within the particular
series of chemicals.

"THE SLOW RUSH”

Illustrated below is the mcml)e.rship pin of a bland-new national
fraternity called Signa Phi Nothing. To join Sigma Phi Nothing
and get this hideous inembcrsliip pin absolutely free, simply
take a pair of scissors and cut out the illustration and paste it
to your dickey.

Let me hasten to state that 1 do not recommend your joining
Signa. Phi Nothing. The only thing I recommend in this column
is Marlboro cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes a
ﬁltered cigarette with an unﬁltered taste, who yearns to settle
back and enjoy a full-ﬂavored smoke, whose heart is quickened
by a choice of soft pack or ﬂip-top box and who gets paid every
week for writing this column.

It is difficult to think of any reason why you should join
Signa Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by
nature; if you are one such I must tell you. there are any number
of better organizations than Sigma. Phi Nothing for you to join-
the Maﬁa, for example.

But if you should join Sigma Phi Nothing, let me give you
several warnings. First oil, it is the only f_ra.ternity that admits
girls. Second,'there is no pledge period; each new member im-
mediately goes active. Perhaps “inactive” is a more accurate
term; there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, no sports,
no games, no dues, no grip, and no house.

The only thing Signs Phi Nothing has that other fraternities
have is a fraternity hymn. In fact, two hymns were submitted

'5”

 

to a recent meeting of the national board of directors (none of
whom attended). The ﬁrst hymn goes:

Hotcha, boop—boop—a-doop,
M other’s making blubber soup.

The second hymn is considerably longc
A Guern3ey’s a cow, '
A road is a lam,

When yo-u.’re eating chow,
Remember the mein!

Pending the next meeting of the national board of directors,
which will never be held, members are authorized to sing either
hymn. Or, for that matter, Stardust.

Perhaps you are asking why there should be such a fraternity
as Signs. Phi Nothing. I will give you an answei-an answer
with which you cannot possibly disagree: Signa Phi N othing
ﬁlls a wellmeeded gap.

Are you suﬁering from mental health? Is logic distorting
your thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth?
Are your long-cherished misapprehensions retreating before a
sea of facts? In short, has education caught up with you?

If so, congratulations. But tell the truth-wouldn't you like
to make an occasional visit back to the good old days when you
were not so wise and composed and industrious-when you
were, in fact, nuttier than a fruitcake?

If you pine for those old familiar miasms, those dear, dead
vapors, join Signa Phi Nothing and renew, for a ﬂeeting
moment, your acquaintance with futility. We promise nothing,
and, by George, we deliver it! a M, M... g....;..,..

O O C

We, the makers of Marlboro, promise smoking pleasure and
we think you'll think we deliver it—both from Marlboro and

from our new unﬁltered king-size Philip Morris Commander.
Welcome aboard{

Date Lhanged

For the first time at the Uni-
versity, commencement will take
place on a Saturday rather than
the traditional Wednesday.

Officials have moved the date to
June-10 this year, breaking the
long—standing tradition of Wed-
nesday commencement, so that
out-of-town parents and students
graduating in April can attend.

“With more and more students
coming to the University from out
of town, we feel that a Saturday
will be more convenient, giving
parents an opportunity to attend
without interfering with their
working hours,” commented Vice
Chancellor Alan Rankin.

The trimester plan also has
made it necessary to change this
traditional date, since commence-
ment no longer coincides with the
end of the term.

“-This eliminates the necessity
of dismissing classes for an entire
day,”. said Vice Chancellor Rankin.

Since commencement will be

 

‘ conducted the same this yearwas

in ‘the past, University officials
do not feel that too much -of the
oldtradition will be missing by
the change of ways.

Not many people get away scot free anymore, even in England. That old

Several negligent policies of the University have re-
sultedin the University being the ﬁrst to have a painting
from the Guggenheim Foundation of New York stolen.

The ﬁrst. mistake was made by the Student Union Board
in letting a painting, the exact value of which cannot be
determined, hang on a small thin chain in the SU lobby.

To refute the argument that the one policeman on
duty—~the policeman who is responsible for watching the
first four floors of the building——assured sufficient protec-

tion to this masterpiece, we point out that many a bank
has been robbed with more than one policeman in the

vicinity. .

The board is guilty for another reason—this, was not
their ﬁrst warning. Recently, another painting was stolen.
Although it was only a copy valued at approximately $100,
this should have been a heeded warning.

Although we are not neglecting the possibility that
the painting was stolen by someone other than a member
of the University, -the chance that it was a member of the
University exists.

In addition to the warning given by the former paint-

ing being stolen, administrators have also had frequent .

warnings of student stealing. These crimes range from’ pil-
fering in the dormitories and the Student Union to the $150
extraction from the bookstore.

All of these minor crimes have occurred in the last

0 month. ‘We don’t think the stakes will be any greater than

the Picasso painting in the future; most likely we will
never have the opportunity to display such items again
since our credit rating has fallen slightly.

But now is not the time to regret what has already hap-
pened. -We can only hope that the painting will be found. If
it has been stolen by an outsider, the matter is completely
out of our hands, and the chances of recovering it are slim.
But if it has been_ stolen by a member of the University, we
are even more involved.

If by some chance, someone has taken the painting
without realizing the real value, and is frightened because
the FBI is investigating, we ask him not to be so rash as

to destroy or mutilate it in any way.

University administrators fear that if the thief was an
amateur, he will burn it. We join them in asking the cul-
prit, if he is a member of the University, to placethe paint-
ing discreetly in a conspicuous place, rather than panic and
destroy one of Picasso’s best. If the person does not want to
leave it somewhere, mail it to us, Pitt News, 407 Schenley

Phinque in Wonderland

By Matthew Nesvisky

Charleton Phinque wanted an Education.

Believe it or not, this was his primary motive
for coming to the University of Pittsburgh. But as
he sits there on the hard wooden bench, staring
down at his snow-dampened tennies, he begins to
wonder if he is in the right place.

The instructor is a sweet,
motherly sort; about six feet
eight inches tall and tipping the
Toledo at around 280 king-sized,
muscle-bound pounds. He grips
a rolled spiral notebook in his
paw, and“ waves it from time to 0
time like a club. As he barks his
lecture throughout the locker
room, he sounds somewhat like
Louis Armstrong with a bad

0 cold.

The instructor is rounding oﬁ‘ his first-day lec-
ture with a profound bit of philosophy: “Even that
guy Plato said that ya gotta have a good, ﬁt body
to carry around a good, ﬁt head. That’s why yer
gonna get physically edjoocaied here at Pitt. An’
Here, the
coach grins with a masochistic gleam in his left eye.
He ﬁngers

we can have lotsa fun doon it, too.”

Charleton Phinque is still not sure.
his bow-tie, the one with the little glass jewels on
it, runs a hand through his blond crew-cut and
swallows, hard. At last, he resigns himself to his
fate. *

The Fun Begins

By the time he has forked over a week’s lunch
money for his gym-rental fee, which is one of those
little “hidden—expenses” that inanages to ‘creep up
on everybody unawares, Charleton has stout-heart-
edly decided to do his best in ,,Physical Education.

“After one week of classes, however, Charleton, like

the rest, of his unfortunate-_cor’npanions, is merely
praying that he- can live through the term.
‘ Charleton must billy—goat up to the Field House

. twice a week, at the ungodlyfhour of eight in the

very early morning. His next step is to get his
gym uniform in the labyrinthine. locker area from
the grim, silent Charon who manages the under-
ground equipment room. Charleton literally hates
his gym clothing. The unwashed socks crackle with

last month’s perspiration as he reluctantly pulls

them onto his feet. The shorts really are: four

sizes too small, that is. The gray, Concentration
Camp-style jersey is baggy, shapeless, and contains
more holes than a Teamster’s' testimony at a Senate
Hearing.

Since Charleton wears glasses, he was ordered to
buy a Plexi-glass face guard, another “hidden ex-
pense.” The tennis shoes, which he also had to
purchase, _complete our_ hero’s garb. Now he is
ready for a two-hour period of grueling ignominy.
On Your Horse

First comes running. Run, Phinque, run! Only
a half-mile mile, Phinque! Of course, your time
better be good! At eight in the morning, this intel-

ligent activity is enough to ﬁnish anyone. But
there is more. ‘
Next is wrestling. As can be expected,

Phinque’s partner is a Ditka-sized half-wit who is
here on a Lacrosse scholarship. Wrestle, Phinque,
wrestle! You can’t leave until you’ve thrown your
opponent, Phinque! Or at least until a rib pops out.
And there is more.

Now comes weight—lifting. This is tops. Phinque
just is not built for this type of sport, but the coach
gives him considerate advice: “Come up inria aft-
ernoon an’ practice.” Lift, Phinque, lift! By the
time this tender activity is over, it is a miracle if
Charleton can muster enough strength to collapse.
But there is more. '

Squash, hand—ba1l, the shuttle—run, trampoline,

basketball, or a ‘cooling-off” half-mile run may still
be in store, depending on the whim of the instruc-
tor. When the two hours are ﬁnally up, Charleton
uses the last of his energy to crawl back to the
locker-room. And it is still not over. ,_ 

With admirable speed, {Charleton vaults into the
shower in an effort to cleanse his broken body.
Then he dashes out, throws on his clothes and
shoots out to the bitter, wintry street to catchthe
campus bus. The bus-driver is in cahoots with the
coaches, of course. As soon as he spys Charleton
running toward him, books askew, shoe—laces flap-
ping and pants falling dangerously low, the driver
pulls out, cackling. Phinque sighs, buttons his shirt,
and starts running for Logan Armory, where he
has his next class.

Fifty cents says he will never make it on time.

Mahatma Gandhi

By Vasanth K. Bhot

Mahatma Ghandi holds a venerable position in
the Indian history. His formidable and perhaps,
unique, weapon Satyagraha which brought free-
dom for India is of universal appeal. The ideals
of sat-ya (truth.),i, ahimsa (non—violence), and
brahmacharya (chastity) played
an important role throughout his
career; and in the long run it

‘resulted in the achievement of

independence for India without
war. It is this fact ‘that leads to

the conclusion why the U.S.
Postal Department issued (on
January 26, 1961) stamps in

honor of Mahatma Gandhi. He
is pictured as "Apostle of Non-
violence.”
A Mohandas Karamchand Gand-

hi was born on October 2, 1869 at Porbandar, a
small village in western India. He was the youngest
son of‘Kaba and Putlibai Gandhi, and belonged
to an Orthodox Bania community. He got his pri-
mary and secondary education in Rajkot. At thir-
teen, whenrhe was still in high school, he married
Kasturibai, a girl of his own age. He stepped into
college in Ahmedabad at his eighteenth year, but
before 1ong,ihe got bored by the way of teaching.
The idea of going over to London and studying
law rooted in his mind; he sailed from Bombay on’
September 4, 1887. He became a barrister and on
June 12, 1891 returned home.
Life's Course Stcrrted

Upon his arrival in India, a Porbandar ﬁrm
offered Gandhi a job in South America’. He knew
that apartheid policy had its influence there at
that time; nevertheless he accepted the offer and
in April 1893, he sailed for Natal. He got himself
admitted as an advocate of the Supreme Court of
Natal. He established Natal Indian Congress on
May’ 22, 1894 and became its secretary. ‘He at-

-tempted to ameliorate the conditions of Indians in

South Africa. His adroit handling of the delicate

   

situation pleased the Indians in India; they began
to call him Bapuji (father) and to regard him as
Mahatma. ‘

In 1901, when Gandhi returned home, he
found his fellow citizens suffering. He felt an
affinity for all those who suffered; their pains were
his pains. He founded Satyagraha Ashran on May
25, 1915 at Ahmedabad. Its main function was to
abolishgthe feeling “untouchables” towards a cer-
tain caste of people and to encourage them to

‘move in social circles.

Willing Worker

His next campaign was to investigate the griev-
ances of the indigo workers‘ of Binar. He under-
stood that the needs of these poor peasants were
“to be free from‘ fear.”
to ﬁght in court, but Gandhi decided to introduce

, Satyagraha. He pleaded in court that there was the

necessity‘ of investigation of the grievances of the
farmers. His endeavor was a success and thus the
Cryptic Weapon Satyagraha came. into existence.

Very soon, he was called upon by the mill work-
ers of a textile industry in Ahririedabad to extricate
them from the ill treatment by their owners. As if
to test the efficacy of his weapon he advised them
to make Satyagraha. It effected a rapproachment‘
between the workers and the owners.

Gandhi now started to preach to his fellow
citizens the importance of freedom, and how they
could achieve it without violence. He tried to

make the people understand the signiﬁcance of .
He emphasized wearing‘

self-sufficiency.
swadeshi (domestic made) clothes. Indian struggle
thus Started; swaraj was their goal and satyagraha
was their sword. Result—-India achieved indepen-
dence on August«l5, 1947.

Mahatma Gandhi thus showed to the world that
one could win without violence. It requires truth

and Perseverance. The stamps issued by the U.S. ,.

Postal Department symbolize Hahatma Gandhi‘s
ideals. And they also voice the respect that the
United States has towards Mahatma Gandhi.

City Officials

-‘Hold Career

Talk Friday

By HARRIET WEHNER

In 1980,
will h o u s e approximately
31¢/0 of the people, the stat-
isticians tell us. Because of

American cities

‘this, each year the need for

college graduates working in

the ﬁeld of urban government will i

increase, a group of city ofﬁcials
stated at a career conference here
last week.

The Honorable Joseph M. Barr,
Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh
and other city ofﬁcials met with
Frank Bane, chairman, U. S. Ad-
visory Commission on Inter—gov-
ernment Relations, and various
members of the Graduate School
of Public and International Af-
fairs, to discuss the issue.

“What can be done to attract
promising young people into ca-
reers in city government” was the
topic of this conference.

I In order to get the engineers,
planners, sociologists, and students

of every ﬁeld and interest needed
to‘ design and run cities of both
now and the future, the ﬁeld of
local government must lose the

V present undesirable image which

exists in the mind of the public.
SUGGESTIONS MADE
Several suggestions were made
concerning how this could be ac-
complished. Frank Bane said that
this situation will disappear only
when local government becomes
an attractive area in which the
college graduate can develop his
future, when it pays him well, and
when it oﬁers him a variety of ex—
,perience. ''
, “City governments should have
definite training programs,” said
Robert L. Brown of the Gradu-
ate School of Public and Inter-
national Aﬂ’airs. “Without deﬁ-
nite policies and programs, local
government appears like a 20-
year climb with small beneﬁts.”
“Corporations give fellowships
to train students,” Thomas ‘S.
Francis’ of the Public Aﬁairs
School said, “but none of the local
or city governments are offering
anything comparative or competi-
tive with them. In addition, stu-
dents in local government have
the least priority in obtaining gov-
ernment loans.”
The Honorable David Olbum,

city councilman, said that starting
at the college level is too late. He
said, “Why not introduce courses
in metropolitan science in high
schools? We are not going to ﬁnd
out how to develop the cities of
the future by having good garbage
collectors.”
POLITICAL BREACH
Concerning‘ the apparent breach

between businessmen and politi—~

cians, Bernard E. Loshbough, ‘Ex-
ecutive Director, Action Housing,
Inc., suggested that exchange of
manpower programs be set up be-
tween government and business.

Loshbough refuted F r a n k
Bane’s statement that business-
men have a contempt for politi-
cians by saying that business-
men merely did not want to suf-
fer with the politicians.

In summing up how politicians
suffered, Loshbough spoke quite
candidly. He said, ‘iln regard to
status and prestige in the com-
munity, we are looked down
upon because we are living on .
taxpayers money. a

“In addition,” he continued, “we
are tortured and humiliated by the
press. Why wouldn’t
prefera higher salary without de-
nounciations!”

The only possibility of Tech
not arriving tonight would be if
some sadist sabotaged their ga-
loshes. When the Tartans take the
ﬂoor this evening, they will try
to strengthen the prophecy of
their coach, Mal Cratsley, who
claimed recently that his team
could go all the way without de-
feat._ ‘

Westminster somewhat deﬂated
this promise when they beat Tech,
68-56, Saturday. However, they
did fare much better against the
Titans than the Panthers did
earlier, losing 76-51 at home.

“I made a mistakc about
Westminster,” Cratsley ration-
alized. “I made that statement
a little facetiously, but maybe
we’ll win all the rest. I think
we have a good chance to beat
Pitt.”

When queried about Cratsley’s

kidded, “I don’t know about the
outcome of the game yet. Maybe
Cratsley has a better line in with
someone than I do. I can’t tell the

making a million dollars.”

as both mentors meditate on the
action of the 75-66 Panther win
earlier in the campaign.

“We’ve been playing better
ball lately,” Cratsley remarked.
“Except for the horrible Juniata
game at the Field House last

, week. Bob Drum (Press writer)
was right when he said that it
set the game back twenty
years.” ., ,

“We certainly wanted to beat
Pitt in the worst way the last
time, but our play didn’t reveal
it. We’ll have to put a little more
effort into it this time because
they have been playing real well
lately. I’m sorry they postponed
their game too, because they
would have been tired. Now
they’ll be fresh and eager."

“Our team played a better game
against Westminster than Pitt
did, but I think it was their worst
game of the year. I don’t expect

them to repeat that, but I wish
we could catch them on an oﬁ-

Aid to Soccer
Players Could
Cause Discord

By JACK SMITH
Executive Sports Editor

 

VVIIDVIUIPIIIIIIIIPIIIIIIIIIIIUID

For the first time next year scholarships or University

 service awards may be offered to athletes in soccer and -it

may do as much to build discord among Panther soccer play-
ers as playing the game without a goalie.

In past seasons the team has existed without awards.
But like all other coaches in Panther sports, Coach Leo
Bemis feels his team cannot handle its rough schedule or be
chosen for play in the NCAA tournament at the end of the
season, without top caliber players. It seems that colleges
like Bridgeport, Maryland, West Chester and Michigan are
attracting much of the nation’s top soccer talent through
athletic aid. . _ _

lt’s true that Pitt will have to offer athletic aid in order
to handle its rough schedule or win enough games to be
selected for NCAA competition. But the University will not

I give aid to the entire first team. The plan before the schol-

arship committee calls for, at the most, four awards.

Coach‘ Bemis plans to split the awards for books and tui-
tion, giving four half awards to incoming freshmen and the
other four halves to members of the varsity who excelled
last season.

We wonder if it is fair to ask the other 26 members
of the Panther soccer team to play under non-award
status while four of their teammates are helped through
school with athletic aid. We realize that 26 or 30 service
awards would be impossible to obtain; but there are 11
members on the ﬁrst team. Each player contributes to
the team effort and each should be rewarded equally;

Even. a “minor” sport like squash gets more than four
awards for -its athletes. The Athletic Department may soon
ﬁnd that in order to build a soccer powerhouse, it has to
give scholarships to all, or to none.

* =1! =l¢ :8 =1!

Many Panther sportsfans are asking why Pitt's All-

"American end Mike Ditka chose to play in the National

Football League next year rather than the new American
League.
Ditka has» signed a contract with the Chicago Bears of

__ the National loop, reportedly turning down a larger offer
.- to -play for a Texas team of the American League.

V D-itka, everyone’s All-American, could go into either
league next year and become a star. Ditka picked the Na-

. tional League for several reasons.

“It is an established league,” Ditka explained, “And
‘the players are considered to be the best. I feel I’ll learn
more from the players in the National League; they
know all the ropes. As for the American League, well,
.I don’t think it would be the challenge because the com-
petition wouldn’t be as stiff.
Didn’t the difference in money make any difference to
Ditka? “Sure, the offer of more money was tempting,” Ditka
said, “but considering everything that the two leagues of-
fered,,I felt the National League was better. I’m not the only
football players _who feels this way; most of the All-Ameri-

cansyl met said the National League presented more of 'a
x A challenge.” a

We feel Ditka is ready to
fessional football.

Cats Cancel I
Squash Match
With Dickinson

Three Racquetmen
To Play in Nationals

The Panther Squash match
with Dickinson College, slat-
ed for the Field House this
Saturday afternoon, has been
cancelled. It has been re-
scheduled for February 25 as
a home match.

The reason for the postpone-
ment is to enable the Cats top
three racquetmen, Dave O’Lough-
lin, Joe Brown, and Ralph Mason
Jr. to compete in the Nationals

which will be held at Philadelphia»

this weekend.

Last Thursday, in a City League
match, the Panthers’ number one
man, Dave O’Loughlin, defeated
John Bowers three sets to two.
Bowers is currently the Pittsburgh
Open Champion, having won the
title in last week’s tournament.

According to Coach Pope,
“The 0’Loughlin-Bowers‘ match
was one of the best matches I’ve
seen. It was such a great match
that every other match stopped
to watch.”

Last weekend, the Cats’ top three
players went to Cleveland for a
team tournament. With some of
the country’s best competition en-
tered, the Panther racquetmen
managed to reach. the semi-ﬁnals.
They were defeated by a team
from Detroit, which lost to Cleve-
land 3-0 for the title.

Matmen Like Success;
Maryland Next on List

After soundly beating Michigan State on Saturday, the
Panther grapplers are looking forward to a successful second
half to the 1961 campaign. This Saturday the matmen will
host the Maryland Terrapins at Canon-McMillan School at

8:00 p.m.

After the Maryland meet the Blue and Gold run

two of the East's top teams Le-
high and Penn State. Leliigh is
exceptionally strong this year and
are rated among the best in the
nation. Penn State has its usual
strong team.

‘ The Terps are the defending
Atlantic Coast Conference cham-
pion and should give the Panthers
some trouble. They l.ost their first
match of the season Saturday to
Penn State.

Terps Have Maunder

The Terrapins are strong in the
123 pound class, where an out-
standing sophomore, Ron Maun-
cler, will wrestle. Maunder knock-
ed Penn State’s Dennis Slattery
from the unbeaten ranks Satur-
day. Gene Kerwin, who wrestles
at 157 pounds for the Terps, is
the defending Atlantic Coast Con-
ference champion.

Panther Coach Rex Peery
seems to have hit on his best
lineup and will stick with the
same eight men that he used in
defeating Michigan State.

The only possible change will
involve a switch in weight among
two men. Augie Arrigone and Bill

Thinclads Receive Invitation

To Philadelphia I nquircr M cct

Cats To Enter Mile, Two-mile Relay Teams;
Coach Rees Expects Runners to do We-ll‘

By JACK SMITH

A- special invitation was ex-
tended to the Panther track team
to run its one and two-mile relay
teams in the Philadephia Inquirer
Meet Friday night.

Although the Panthers have
failed to win their ﬁrst two idual
meets this year, Coach Carl Rees
expects the thinclads to place in
the two indoor races this week-
end.

In dual meets, Panther runners
were forced to run several races
and, therefore, never had excep-
tional times when it came to the
last two races of the meet, the
mile and two-mile relays.

At Top Strength

“Since we only have to run two
races,” Rees said, “our team
should be at top strengt. .”

Both indoor relays will be run
in heats. The Panthers don’t
ﬁgure to be in the fastest heats.
Winners, however, are judged
according to the fastest times,
not according to the winners of
any particular heat.

Manhattan appears to be the top
contender for the two‘-mile relay.
Last weekend Manhattan broke
the world’s record ‘for that event.
reeling oﬂf the two miles in 7:32.'8.
Villanova and Georgetown also
are considered top contenders. The

Panthers best time to date is 7:51. ,

Fresh First Team
With a fresh—ﬁrst-team of Harry
Stokes, Vance Carter, Reed Clarke
and co-captain Bill Hinchberger,

the Panthers could lower their,

two-mile time to 7:40.

“VMI will certainly be tough
and the spectators will be sure to
get their share of thrills from this
meet,” commented.Coach Grady.

Steve Munter will replace
Clark in the mile relay. The rest
of the team will be composed of
Hinchberger, Stokes and Carter.
Stokes and Carter are the only
Panthers timed in the mile re,-
lay and have posted times of
49.4 and 49.8 respectively for
the quarter-mile. _

Two years ago the Panthers set
an IC4A record in the mile relay,
running the distance of 3:18.6.

“Although we have to run the
two-mile event ﬁrst,” Rees com-
mented, “I feel we have the team
to equal our IC4A record. Stokes
and Carter are sophmriores and
may find the stiff competition a
test of their ability.”
