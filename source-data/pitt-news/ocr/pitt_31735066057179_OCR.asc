Initiatives aim
to raise minority
retention rates

By Jack Finn
Asst. News Editor

Minority recruitment and retention is the focal
point of several initiatives at Pitt this summer.

“Minorities are historically disadvantaged groups
such as African—Americans, Hispanics and Native
Americans,” senate student affairs committee Chair
Jonathan Schooler said.

The student affairs committee sponsored a resolu-
tion addressing minority retention that was
approved by the Faculty Assembly and the Senate
Council and forwarded to Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, according to Schooler.

The Minority Retention Resolution contains four
elements:

-The Office of Enrollment Management is to
develop a coordinated system to manage minority
retention. Current evaluation, program recommen-
dations, program development, liaison and formal
reporting would all be functions of the management
program.

-The Mentor Challenge Scholarship Program
would select upperclass and graduate students who
would perform as mentors for incoming first—year
minority students.

Scholarship awards and Honors Convocation
recognition would be partqof the program.

°The introduction of cultural—diversity issues into
the curriculum, promoting minority research and
expansion of university workshops that concentrate
on diversity. Familiarizing people with alternative
perspectives and ways- in which unintended offenses
may occur is a goal. _ ‘

°Contributions to address target funding for
minority retention and recmitment. Additional schol-
arships and minority programs would be fund uses.

“The attrition rate for minority students is 51.1 per-
cent as compared to 55.6 percent for white stu-
dents,” Schooler said.

These figures were for 1985 through 1990. If a stu-
dent was enrolled in 1985 but was no longer
enrolled‘ or had not graduated by 1990, they were
considered to be part of the attrition rate, according
to Schooler.

“This represents a substantial difference and is the
cause for our concern,” Schooler said.

Vice Provost Jack Daniel has recently implement-
ed a three-level program aimed at minority reten~
tion.

“Chancellor O’Connor has approved five graduate
fellows in honor of K. Leroy Irvis, five undergradu~
ate scholarships in honor of Helen Faison, and six

post-doctoral awards for research, all targeted for,

minorities,” Daniel said.

The three levels of scholarship awards are intend-
ed to enhance the opportunities for minorities at
Pitt, according to Daniel.

UPMC tuition,-assistance program adds credit ﬂexibility

By Frank Porco
Asst. News Editor

University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center employees will
have more options available to
them when choosing their class-
es for the upcoming year.

According to UPMC
spokesperson Jane Duffield,
UPMC will make some changes
to the tuition—assistance policy

beginning with the pay period
ofjuly 11.

The change will affect the
per-term credit limits and the
amount of tuition assistance
available to staff attending
learning institutions other than
Pitt, Duffield said.

“The tuition policy changes
are limited to the University of
Pittsburgh in-state program,”
Duffield said. “The changes

were made as a cost-saving
measure for UPMC.”

The changes affect only those
staff members who receive the
medical center’s beneﬁt option.

After July 1, regular full—time
staff will be eligible for tuition
assistance up to 24 credits per
calendar year. Staff may distrib-
ute the credits ﬂexibly over the
school terms.

Previously, the tuition assis-

tance for full time staff was lim-
ited to six credits per term, four
terms per year.

Regular part—time staff who
work atleast 32 hours per pay
period will be eligible for tuition
assistance. The amount of assis-
tance that part—time staff will
receive is dependent on the
number of work-week hours.

Part-time staff who work
between 32 and 39 hours per

pay period receive six credits
per year, those who work
between 40 and 47 hours per
pay period receive nine credits
per year, and those who work
between 48 and 79 hours per
pay period receive 12 credits
per year.

Regular full—time staff who
have received tuition assistance
during 1993 will determine their

Student attempts to organize Pitt atheist group

By Dave Titmus
For The Pitt News

Atheists leada lonely life at
the University of Pittsburgh. Just
ask student Chris Hanson.

Hanson said that he would
like to start an atheist group on
campus but the interest for one
has not presented itself. “There
hasn’t been much of a
response,” he said.

‘Hanson, who attended the
University of Minnesota before
coming to Pittsburgh, said that

Stucents often affected by nair Loss,

By Alan Chmiel
Staff Writer

There. are many items claiming to be
instant remedies for hair loss, from hair
paint to cow (lung. Many wives’ tales have
perpetuated the myths of instant hair

restoration.

Young people of college age are not
immune to the problems of hair loss.

Pitt’s criteria for starting a stu-
dent group is strange. “At
Minnesota, a larger school,'you
only need three people to start
a student group, at Pitt you
need at least 10,” Hanson said.
Terry Milani of the Office of
Student Activities said that
“every student group must meet
the same guidelines.” The orga-
nization must have a constitu-
tion, 10 members, three officers
and a clearly defined relation-
ship between both the universi-
ty and the student organiz_ation.

Statistics show that hair loss affects 40 per- D
cent of the male college population and 10
percent of the female college population.

Dr. Lorna Lacen Thomas, a dermatologist
who specializes in hair loss, is trying to dis-
pel the myths of hair loss. For instance, the
tall tale about the ramifications involved in
wearing a baseball cap (mainly hair loss)
simply is not true, she said. ‘

Thomas has been featured in electronic

Milani said that if these guide-
lines were met, Hanson’s group
would be accepted. “We don’t
evaluate a group based on [its]
beliefs,” Milani said.

Having an atheist group on
campus would allow the univer-
sity to bring in guest speakers,
Hanson said. A student group
could “help spread the word,”
he joked.

An atheist since the sixth
grade, Hanson said that his
interests were piqued by
mythology and superstitions. “I

saw that mythology and early
religions were inventions by
man for the unexplained things
in his world._I saw the same
ideas at work behind
Christianity,” Hanson said.

“Atheism has been looked at
as foolish because you can’t dis-

the same thing can be said
about Zeus or the Easter
Bunny.” .

She said that hair loss in women is differ-
ent than hair loss in men. Most male hair
loss is on the crown of the head, known as
male pattern baldness, whereas women
tend to lose their hair at an even pace all
over their head, Thomas said.

Hair loss is caused by a number of things,

Internships give students the ecge, Placement Center says

By Mike Lyczko
Staff Writer

Reflecting a national trend,
fewer companies are contact-
ing the University Placement
Center and those that are have
fewer positions available,
according to Robert Perkoski,
director of the University
Placement Center.

“Companies are downsizing,
restructuring, spinning off divi-
sions, hiring less people, get-
ting rid of people, diversifying
— all to become more compet-
itive. Businesses have different
beliefs than they used to,”
Perkoski said.

In previous economic
slumps, workers were simply
rehired when times got better.
With all the restructuring, there
may not be a job to go back to,
according to Perkoski.

Perkoski said that students
look out to the job field and
see "no guarantees, no certain-
ty about the future.”

Even people with jobs are
uncertain — they’re staying
put, wary of moving on and
wondering if their job is safe,
he said.

“Students are more anxious,
not as confident, not as willing

ple. years ago. There are defi-
nitely more going to graduate
school, and more are delaying
the start of their job search,"
Perkoski said.

He added that anecdotal evi-
dence points to the poor econ-
omy as an important factor in
more students going to gradu-
ate school.

Students are adapting to the
changing economy by doing
more volunteering and intern-
ships, working part time — all
to get work skills, Perkoski
said.

What can a liberal arts major
do when even those in techni-
cal fields are finding jobs dwin-
dling? Perkoski said it is a good
idea to get some work experi-
ence that is related to one’s
career.

“A person who has already
been volunteering, interning or
working part time for a compa-
ny has a great advantage for a
full—time position," he said.

phrases [from companies]: is

it takes to train a worker]?
Students need to develop a
track record.

In the communications field,
it is next to impossible to get a
job unless you have spent time
volunteering or interning," he
said.

According to Perkoski, coin-
bining liberal arts and technical
areas is not necessarily the
answer.

“You can’t force a technical
field or health care on a person
just because its popular at the
time. It is important not to get
too narrow a focus," he said.

“lt’s a bad move to make a
decision on a major solely on
employment opportunities. It
may make you more mar-
ketable now but may hurt in
the long run.

You need to make it broader
—— there should be a group of
factors in deciding a major,"
Perkoski said, pointing out that
no matter what your field is,
basic skills are needed. “You
have to be able to communi-
cate. You have to make deci-

sions.“

Even areas that used to have
plenty of jobs, such as health
care, are changing.

"Health care is going through
a wait-and—see attitude.

Nobody has a crystal ball. If

you talk to five different people
you get five different answers.
You can’t tell what’s going to
happen four years down the
road, but you can look at
trends," Perkoski said.

Other changes in the job
market are the growth in tem-
porary positions and contract
jobs — companies that contract
their services out for a certain
project.

There are more service-ori-
ented jobs. More companies
are hiring others to perform
services they used to do them-
selves, such as food, janitorial
and computing services,
Perkoski said, adding that the
computer field is constantly
changing, with more and more
job titles.

As bad as things are,
Perkoski said that the
Pittsburgh area is actually
doing a little better, having
adjusted and diversified after

Harassment policy needs revised

From July 1, 1992 until June 50, 1993, Pitt’s Office of
Affirmative Action dealt with 17 cases of alleged sexual
harassment.

Although the number may seem low, assistant director
of affirmative action Elaine Frampton said she believes
otherwise.“It’s much more prevalent than statistics or data
reflect,” Frampton said. .

Pitt’s definition of sexual harassment involves unwel-
come sexual advances, requests or comments in three
cases: 1. When submission to remarks affects academic or
employment success. 2. When submission or rejection
affects an academic or employment decision. 3. When the
conduct affects performance or creates a hostile or offen-
sive environment.

Although Pitt’s policy is to prohibit sexual harassment,
the university community needs to be aware of the defini-
tion as well as their policy. The fact that a policy exists is
not enough. 1

Although we commend the staff of the Office of
Affirmative Action for sponsoring workshops and educa-
tional seminars for faculty and staff, more students need
to be educated and made aware of where to turn if they
are the victim of harassment.

As well as making students aware, changes in the policy
are needed. The procedure suggests that the first step to
be taken when there is a complaint of sexual harassment
is an informal resolution, which recommends that “the
complainant take individual action to resolve the problem
through written or verbal action.” This can be done alone
or with an Affirmative Action staff member serving as
mediator. The policy also states that, “every effort should
be made to resolve a problem informally.”

Frampton said that many students are afraid to report
their cases because of a fear that their grades will be low-
ered. Yet with this informal policy, Pitt would encourage
a student to personally confront a professor whose
actions are offensive.

If the informal complaint is insufficient, there is also a
Formal Complaint Resolution in which a written com-
plaint is filed with the university and involves an investi-
gation. The policy states that, “while every effort will be
made to protect the privacy rights of all parties, confiden-
tiality cannot be guaranteed.”

In both informal and formal cases the victim is unable to
remain anonymous. Such a policy discourages anyone
from filing a complaint who is afraid of the repercussions
— which only propagates the cycle of sexual harassment.
In this case of suspected sexual harassment, the offended
individual, with a member of Affirmative Action present,
could discuss the situation with the accused. Under Pitt’s
policy, if the complaint is valid the offender could simply
apologize and promise to never do it again. There would
be no punishment and no incentive to refrain from the
behaviors with other individuals.

Pitt’s sexual harassment policy needs to be more sympa-

Youths should learn about AID S

According to the American College Health
Association, the safest way to protect against sex-
ually transmitted diseases is to use alcondom or a
dental dam. _

Details and Madamoiselle magazines recently
polled 2,500 of their readers to find out if they
actually follow this advice.

Most of America. may profess faith in condoms,
but according to the survey, 39 percent of
women, 28 percent of straight men and 25 per-
cent of gay men have not used a condom during
sex.

sex education in schools as early as fourth grade.
But schools across the country differ in their
views about what their students should be taught.

On Prom Night at Benicia High School in
California‘, the officers of the senior ‘class passed
out condoms and a Planned Parenthood pam-
phlet promoting abstinence along with the nor-
mal candy and party favors. .

In York County, Pa., teenagers sponsor the
Great Sex-Out. A day is set aside to ponder the
possibility of abstinence. The day is, of course,

“sex free”.

But two-thirds of men polled
describe “safe sex” as sex with a
condom. Forty-nine percent of
women agree.

The reasons for not using a

ADAM
N OVAK

Students can grab a con-
dom in the nurse’s office at
Santa Monica High. The con-
doms come in a bag with a
paragraph-long note about

condom range from the fact that
some people are trying to get
pregnant to others who just find condoms
uncomfortable and awkward to use.

Half of the gay men polled know at least three
people who are HIV—positive, compared to the
four percent of heterosexuals that know anyone
who is HIV-positive. Unfortunately, the poll did
not ask lesbians to identify themselves so there is
no ﬁgure available for them.

Not surprisingly, “safer sex” practices are
increasing among those who know someone who
is HIV—positive or who has AIDS. Also according
to the survey, gay men, once thought to be the
highest “risk group” for contracting HIV, are now
the highest group practicing safer sex.

In another poll, Time (May 24, 1993) examined
women and men from the age of 12 through 17, a

j group that is sometimes overlooked when sexual

practices are observed. During the teen years,

many begin to explore their sexuality. Instead of ’

teaching teenagers about how they should go
about sexual practices in a responsible manner,
the infamous “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy is
adopted.

By not educating teenagers about responsibili-
ty, the inevitable outcome will be the adults who
do not practice what they preach.

I’m not saying that we should run out and grab
each 13-to-17-year—old and force them to have
sex. Rather, everyone should know what a con-
dom is, what an STD is, how a woman gets preg-
nant and what it means when a partner says “no.”

It may be scary to think about the possibility of
a younger generation having sex, but according
to the poll in Time, at age 15 a quarter of females
are sexually active and a third of boys are.

Twenty—three percent claim that they lost their
virginity under‘ the age of fourteen. The same
goes for 24 percent at age fourteen, 25 percent at
fifteen, 20 percent at sixteen and 6 percent at sev-
enteen.

With facts like these, it is hard to argue against

why students should think
-about abstinence. -

Although abstinence is stressed when talking to
teens about sex, some believe that this is a futile
measure. Peter Benson, of the Minneapolis-based
Search Institute which studies child and adoles-
cent issues, says that “It used to be easy to say it’s
just wrong to have sex before marriage  We
went through a sexual revolution since the ‘()()s
that poked a major hole in that. And nothing has
come along to replace it. What’s responsible sex-
uality now? Does it mean no sex unless you’re in
love? No sex unless you’re 21? No sex unless it’s
protected?” (Time, May 24, 1993) 

The debate goes back and forth. Some feel that
sex education should be in all schools, while
some feel that the only thing teenagers should
know about sex is how to abstain from it.

Both sides agree that sexual education classes
should stress more than just what sex is and how
one should go about having it. '

Classes that are based on sexual anatomy and

practices should also focus on building relation- '

ships in which dignity and respect are encour-
aged. These relationships are not only about dat-
ing, but also about respect.

The group, Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy,
concentrates on helping low—income teens avoid
early pregnancy and poverty and just to be there
for teens to talk to when they don’t have anyone
else.

Heather Johnston Nicholson, director of the
National Resource Center for Girls Inc., said that
PAP helps because  when you’re that age, you
don’t want to be considered a complete dweeb.
We’re establishing a peer group that says it’s O.K.
not to be sexually active.” (Time, May 24, 1993)

Education is key to keeping sex safe for the
parties involved. Teaching our youth will pro-
duce a new generation that won’t have to think
twice about what responsible sexual practices
are.

What’s Love Got To Do
With It?

Starring Angela Bassett and
Larry Fishburne

Directed by Brian Gibson

When you think of Tina
Turner, the things that proba-
bly come to mind are her
long, muscular, gyrating legs,
her longevity, her big hair
and her big, soulful, intensive
voice. To really appreciate the
woman dubbed the “Queen
of Rock—n—Roll,” you should
know her history, which
spans more than five decades.

Wl9at"s Love depicts the
singing career of Tina, from
the young Anna Mae Bullock
(played so authentically by
Rae’Ven Kelly) being thro_wn
out of a church choir
rehearsal for her overwhelm-
ing enthusiasm to her life
touring with her abusive ex-
husband, Ike Turner, to her
independence which has led
her to multiple nu.mbe,r-one
hits including “What’s Love
Got To Do With It” and
"Private Dancer.”

Tina Turner, born Anna
Mae Bullock, was abandoned
by her overburdened mother

Zelma (played by Jennifer _

Lewis) when she was young
to be raised by her grand-
mother in Nutbush, Tenn.
After her grandmother died,
Anna Mae in her teens moved
to St. Louis, Mo. to live with
her mother and sister.

Ike Turner and the Ikettes
played at a club where her
sister Alline Bullock (played
by Phyllis Yvonne Stickney)
worked as a bartender.

During a scene-where the
clubgoers would pass a
microphone around the room

to see who the best female

singer was, Tina got the mike
-—— and the rest is history.
Angela Bassett, who plays
Tina, portrayed her as coura-
geous and enduring, and per-
formed with immense energy
-— especially considering she
isn’t a trained dancer. Tina
performed many tiring rou-
tines with the backup singers
in the band. Bassett worked
with choreographer Michael
Peters, who among other

From the droning bass that opens “Feeding Fren7.y”
to the full choral coda in “Now or Never Land,” it is
apparent that Earth and Sun and Moon is not your
typical, run-of-the-mill Midnight Oil album.

Earth is not the blistering political opus that Oil’s
1987 breakthrough Diesel and Dust was. While
“T ruganini” refers to the capture of Tasmanian abo-
rigines in the 19th century (“I see Namatjira in cus-

things choreographed the
dance sequences in Michael

videos. They studied videos
of Tina’s performances,
ensuring Bassett would pick
up all of Tina’s nuances.
Bassett said, “My feet hurt
from dancing in high heels.”
The real Tina recorded the
songs in the movie for Bassett
to lip sync.

Tina was the victim of wife
battery. The second half of
the movie,which can be hard
to watch, has excerpts from
Tina’s life of being beaten and
tormented emotionally by Ike
Turner, played by Laurence
Fishburne.

Playing Ike wasn't easy,
and Fishburne turned down
the offer to play him at first.
Ike virtually became a mon-

Garrett’s anger is not nearly as prevalent  in “The
Dead Heart” and “Beds Are Burning.” And though
Garrett bemoans “oil spills in the water where
Columbus once sailed" in the new albums title track,
the song is not quite the sad tale of environmental
nightmares.

And the changes are not merely in the 11 songs’
lyrics. The horn and string arrangements found in
many of Oil’s earlier works have been largely
replaced by garage—band guitar riffs.

ster in the second act of the
movie. Fishburne eventually
took the project after learning
that Angela Bassett would be
playing Tina, and that director
Brian Gibson and producer
Doug Chapin would let him
make changes in the charac-
ter and make Ike’s mean
qualities transform him, rather
than him being a bad guy
from the beginning.

The climactic scene where
Tina would soon escape from
Ike happened in a limo taking
the couple to a hotel. Ike initi-
ated the fight and Tina fought
back hard. The audience at
the Manor theater roared in
glee after Tina kicked Ike in
the groin with her big plat-
form shoes.

Laurence said this was the
last scene filmed because it

was so physical and the mak-
ers of the film didn’t want to
have to contend with injuries
while doing other scenes.

Tina found strength and
solace in her friend Jackie,
played by Vanessa Bell
Calloway, who was one of
the Ikettes before she left the
group due to Ike’s behavior.

This film gives one tremen-
dous respect for the real Tina
Turner, for an individual who’
has come up through all that
and made a success of her
life.

This writer wasn’t a big fan
of Tina, but I’m buying her

‘Much Ado’
giddy romp

Much Ado About Nothing
Written and Directed by
Kenneth Branagh

Starring Branagh, Denzel
Washington,
Keanu Reeves and Emma
Thompson

America and Hollywood in par-
ticular have always been suckers
for high culture. Hollywood has its
own particular complex dating
back to the big studios. In the
golden era it was practice to sign
literary figures like William
Faulkner to write their screen-
plays. The Warner Brothers pre-
sented early “photoplays” in which
great Works of the theatre were
filmed to be handed down to “cul-
ture” the masses.

Louis Mayer used to rent famous
paintings from an -art museum and
have them rotated on a regular dis-
play in his home.

Needless to say art and film have
had a conspicuous relationship in
this country. i

Shakespeare on film could be
the best example of this.
Unfortunately, Kenneth Branagh’s
Much Ado About Nothing does lit-
tle to challenge the tradition of
Shakespeare on film or the Warner
Brothers’ condescending legacy.

The fact that what Shakespeare
wrote was intended for theatres ——
its episodic narrative and scene-
based nature —— is in contrast to
film’s ability to produce seamless
narratives through location shoot-
ing, editing, voice—over, etc.
Though Shakespeare has spawned
a million spinoffs (Rosencrantz
and G-ila’enstern Are Dead is a
recent example), his plays’ appear-
ance on film is highlighted solely
by the substitution of natural loca-
tions for painted sets and little
else.

Such is the case with Much Ado.
The play Branagh calls
Shakespeare’s “most accessible”
gets a pretty standard treatment
with a few technical show-off

See Ado, page 7

So what's the deal here? Has Oil, who once spent
an entire year touring the Australian outback, begun
to (dare I say it) sell out? Hardly.

The fact of the matter is that Midnight Oil is a rock-
and—roll band who has finally decided to kick back,
crank up its amps and ROCK. Earth and Sun and
Moon seems to recall Midnight Oil’s earliest days,
before its well-documented outback trip and Garrett’s

association with Greenpeace, when they used to rock

bars up and down Australia’s eastern coast.
Despite local radio station WRRK’s recent switch to
(God help us all) “classic rock,” Eart/9 might get some

scenes consistently thrown in to
keep with the spirit of revelry.
The opening sequence’s slow-
mo of the prince and his sol-

.diers on horseback returning

Victoriously made me burst into
laughter. It started off like an
Errol Flynn-Douglas Fairbanks
affair with trumpets blaring and
people dancing, jumping and
singing so much as to seem not
a little ridiculous. But in the
spirit of frivolity, it works well
enough even if some of the

chuckles the film often elicits . I

come from its absolute silliness.

The most interesting aspect of
the film is its cast. Littered with
American stars like Denzel
Washington, Keanu Reeves and
Michael Keaton, Much Ado is
spared the staid, British feel of
Branagh’s Henry V. This is not
one of the history plays and the
villa of Leonata, governor of
Messina, on which the entire
film is set serves as a composite
foreign land of nobles and mer-
rymakers alike.

As a shot at bridging the
accessibility gap of Shakespeare
the casting choice might signal a
desire on Branagh’s' part to
blend populist filnr and
Shakespeare —- or it might have
just made funding a lot easier to
obtain.

In either case, Much Ado is
both enjoyable and packed full
of every dramatic emotion a

. viewer might want. Comedy,

romance,‘ swashbuckling, evil
plots, singing and dancing, and
even sex, find their way into

this story.

Such a smorgasbord can’t be
all that bad — and in this case it
isn’t.

Michael Keaton’s little cameo
as the loquacious, babbling
constable is amusing despite his
being a typical English stereo-
type of the Irish comic-idiot.
Malcolm, I mean Denzel
Washington, plays himself
rather well as the prince. Where
the film’s episodic nature fails
most is in conveying the sup-
posed feud between the prince
and his brooding brother, Don
John (Keanu Reeves). Just why
the excellent adventurer sports
such a long face and plots
against the marriage of Claudio
(Robert Sean Leonard) and
Hero (Kate Beckinsale) is never
really explained. Apparently
Shakespeare was to busy enter-
taining to bother with such
details.

As Benedick (Kenneth
Branagh) tells us, “Man is a
giddy thing. That is my conclu-
sion.”

Thank goodness he is, for
Shakespeare and Branagh. Far
more rousing than arousing
Much Ado is filled all the dash,
zest and verve both the Bard
and his interpreter can muster
but precious little innovative or
even compelling about the story
or the way it’s told is exhibited
in the film. Much Ado is itself a
very giddy thing.

And that’s not such a terrible
conclusion.

Ado About Nothing opens

airplay on the new Magic 97.
This is because Oil.’s musical
influences from rock’s heyday
are paid great tribute on this
album. The Lennon harmonized
vocals in “Renaissance Man”
and the backward guitar solo in
“Now or Never Land” are strik-
ingly reminiscent of typical mid-
dle-period Beatles work. And
the bashing chords and anthem-
like bridge in “Tell Me the
Truth” (“Some people tell me
stories, wasting all my time/It’s
my time, yes it’s my time”)
sound an awful lot like some-
thing from The Who’s Tommy.

» However, it wouldn’t be right
to accuse Midnight Oil of a lack

of originality. Heck, any band
willing to search its entire
vocabulary to find a word to
rhyme with “tunic” (here,
Garrett uses “eunuch”) has to
have some creativity. And the
simple effort to break the same
old “songs-about—the—dying-
planet” routine takes a little bit
of inventiveness, too.

While earlier albums such as
Red Sails in the Sunset and
Diesel and Dust portray
Midnight Oil as political and
environmental spokespersons,
Earth and Sun and Moon
showcases the five Australians
as musicians. After all, that's
what they really are.

Pitt soccer bolsters

talent pool with a
local lethal weapon

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

In collegiate athletics today,
the direction in which a pro-

; gram  l1eaded'~f;is ojfte._n “reflect-

ed in its recruiting.‘ A hurting

program needs to rebuild while

a healthy program simply
needs to reload.

The Pitt Panther soccer‘ team
is coming off its most success-
ful season in school history
(12-6-1 overall, 5-2-1 and sec-
ond place Big East finish) and
is already stocked with top-
notch returnees, such as lead-
ing scorers Eric Prex, Dean
Astorino and Ted Noethling, as
well as record-breaking rookie
goaltender Adam Spitzer.

A massive inﬂux of talent is
not exactly what the Panthers
were in dire need of.

Another weapon in the arse-
nal; another cog in the machine
is more like it.

To the mix of the aforemen-
tioned players, the soccer team
has added a talented and high-

ly regarded first-year student»
from Peters Township -—-— Mike

Dyer.

Dyer (five-foot-nine-inch, 150
lbs.) is one of the top players
in the Pittsburgh area and a
key performer on the annually
powerful Peters Township
squad. He was _named All-
WPIAL, All-Region and All-State

last year.
The past couple of summers
Dyer has played on the

Beadling under-19 team. Pitt
Coach Joe Luxbacher says that
Dyer has “played-up” against
the competition he sees every
year with Beadling.

Dyer, whose brother Bob isa
starting defenseman at Pitt, is

the kind of player who ‘can

step right in and challenge the
incumbents for a starting spot.
“He’s definitely a solid play-

er,” Luxbacher said. “He has

the potential to be pretty good.
There is no doubt inlmy mind
he will push someone for a
[starting] spot.

“He’s not that big but he is
both physically and mentally
tough. Guys like Mike can defi-
nitely help our club.”

Even though Luxbacher will
have two Dyers on the squad
—— each of them plays the
game at their own pace.

“Bob is more of a defense-
man by nature. Mike ——
although he can play in the
back — has more of an attack-
er in his personality,”
Luxbacher said.

If Dyer is able to use that
attacking personality once he
arrives in Oakland, he just
might join his brother on the
starting unit. With the gradua-
tion of defenseman Carsten
Bishop and midfielder Brian
Pellegrino, there are only a few
spots available for the taking.

“There are not as many spots
as last year. Not so many open
holes, so to speak. When you
don’t graduate the players, you
don’t have to depend on new
players to lead the team,”
Luxbacher said.

Although Dyer is the sole
recruit, he will not be the only
player to join the Panther team
this year, but due to NCAA
rules Luxbacher cannot corn-
ment on walk-on players indi-
vidually. Yet, he likes what he
sees.

“We have a solid group com-
ing in; they fit well in the pro-
gram,” Luxbacher said. “I was
pleased with the group as a

, _. whole.”  , c

Perseverance pays for one proud Penny

MEMPHIS, TN. —— Penny
kept the dream.

From playing college basket-
ball to being drafted into the
NBA to being traded to the
Orlando Magic, Penny kept the
dream.

Anfernee “Penny” Hardaway
finally, after extensive phone
calls, numerous extra workouts
and an endorsement from star
center Shaquille O’Neal, sold
himself to the) Orlando Magic,
prompting a -colossal trade that
sent Michigan: power forward
and sure-fire all-star Chris
Webber --— who had been cho-
sen number-one only minutes
earlier -—- to the Golden State
Warriors for the kid from
Memphis. '

Trading away the incredibly
strong and talented Webber, an
extremely tough sale for some,
was merely a formality for

Magic’s general manager Pat
Williams, who fell in love with
Hardaway and his game at a
workout featuring NBA and
college players.

“I saw a dozen things
Tuesday [before the draft] that
would’ve had a full house [of
fans] ripping seats from the
building,” Williams‘ said

What began at the Memphis
Pyramid two years ago —
when he first laced up his
sneakers for the Memphis State
Tigers — culminated in an
announcement that stunned not
only the thousands of fans that

packed the draft sight of the-

Palace at Auburn Hills, but also
Magic’s supporters who booed
viciously and threw debris at a
life—size cutout of the 6-foot-6-
inch guard while watching the
draft at the Orlando Arena.

“I promise I will prove them

wrong,” Hardaway said’ of the
bandwagon fans who desper-
ately wanted Webber to wear
Magic pinstripes. “And they will
be loving Anfernee Hardaway
once they get to meet me and
know me and see what kind of
player I am.”

Jason
Brame

The kind of player he is,
according to Williams, is on par
with the elite point guards in
NBA history —- third—person
references and all.

“In my forty-odd years
watching basketball, I could
count five [point] guards that,
when the ball is in their hands,
you stand in anticipation of

what’s going to happen next,”
Williams said, citing Bob
Cousy, Guy Rodgers, Oscar
Robertson, Nate Archibald and
Magic Johnson as the five
greatest point guards he has
seen. “Anfernee is that type of
player  the kid has a gift.”

The gift was obvious not
only to Memphis State fans
who watched him grow up in
the local spotlight, but also to
those who watched helplessly
as Hardaway dazzled stadium
crowds with his skills.

As a Collegian, Hardaway
was the only player in the
country to register in the top
five of his conference — the
Great Midwest —— in five differ-
ent categories: points,
rebounds, assists, steals and
blocks. He led the Tigers in
points, rebounds and assists,
and two consecutive appear-

ances in the NCAAS, including
a run to the Elite Eight in his
sophomore season.

Statistically there is no argu-
ment about his greatness. But
to see him 1111'] the game is to
watch poetry on the basketball
court.

His lightning-quick precision
passes, which often stunned
lesser teammates who had trou-
ble handling the feeds, cut
through defenses like mercuric
darts in a jungle full of gangly
arms and legs.

To say that Hardaway is an
exceptional shooter is to make
a slight understatement. Also,
his first step to the hole is
sneaky-quick. Once he has a
couple of inches, he is al1—but-
impossible to stop.

The much-anticipated
Hardaway/O’Nea1 duo will

prove to be an extremely
daunting combination — one
that will lead them to the
Eastern Conference Finals with-
in three years. Penny will find
the holes that come with Shaq’s
immediate size and strength,
but the most lethal hook—ups
will come when the defense
breaks down to double-team
either of them. If the defense
collapses on Hardaway, know
that the open player is going to
find the ball in his hands. If
Shaq is double—teamed,
Hardaway will find himself
with room to shoot or create.

An incredibly agile point
guard by trade, Hardaway can
comfortably slide down to
shooting guard, where -he can
shoot from the perimeter  or
penetrate  or create.

Hardaway can also play small
forward. Dennis Scott currently
occupies that station for
Orlando, but his large salary
and penchant for being injury-
prone make him a more obvi-
ous candidate for relocation ——
a must in Magic land -— than
point guard Scott Skiles or
power forward Brian Williams.

No matter the lineup,
Hardaway is guaranteed to step
in and excite from Day One.
His priorities, slightly eschewecl
from fellow money-hungry
draftees are simple. “I’m not
going to let anything stand in
my way of playing for
Orlando,”‘Hardaway said. “I

 

want to be a veteran when the
season starts.”

The world that now stands at
his fingertips was once highly
in doubt.

Hardaway missed virtually all
of his senior year at Memphis’
Treadwell High School due to
academic difficulties, and was
forced to sit out his freshmen
year at Memphis State, a victim
of Proposition 48. Then, after
conquering the scholastic
obstacles that kept him from
competing, a stray bullet nearly
ended his promising career.

During his first year of col-
lege, while visiting his cousin
and University of Tennessee
guard LaMarcus Golden’s inner-
city home, Hardaway was
struck in the foot by a bullet
fired several hundred feet from
him. While no permanent dam-
age was done, it forced him to
miss valuable practice time.

Instead of deterring the
young Hardaway from achiev-

ing, all of these incidents just
lend to the legend that has
grown from his days in junior
high school. A role model for
local kids during his two-year

‘stint as a Tiger, Hardaway

made the Dean’s List in sec-
ondary education —- after once

barely scraping by to make it

into college.

Hardaway currently partici-
pates in an anti-drug campaign
that features his likeness dis-
played prominently throughout
Memphis on billboards.
Accompanying his name and
picture are three words“ that
signify whatthe young athlete
has always exemplified -—- even
through times that would have
made lesser talents pack it up
and leave.

The three words read simply,
“Keep the Dream” —- some-
thing Penny knows much
about.
