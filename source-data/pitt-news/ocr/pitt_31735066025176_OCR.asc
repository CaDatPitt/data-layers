The first-ever baboon liver transplant recipient died Sunday,
71 days after the history-making operation, according to
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center spokesperson Jane

Doctors say he died at 9:45 pm. Sunday at Presbyterian
University Hospital as a r'esult—of an unidentified intracranial
hemorrhage, or bleeding inside the skuil, according to UPMC.

A small degree of _intracranial hemorrhaging is one. of the 9
causes of strokes. However, large hemorrhages are usually

On Aug. 29 the patient’s condition had been downgraded to

' serious and he had been put on a ventilatorto assist his

breathing when he contrac.ted”a_n infection. Doctors said the
erract cause of the infection was unknown. ’

Baboon liver transplant recipient dies

On Sept. 1, doctors again downgraded the liver recipients
condition, ‘this time to critical. The patient was being given
antibiotics to combat the infection.

Although his liver ‘function had deteriorated as a result of
the infection, doctors said there was still no sign of rejection.

According to UPMC, an autopsy was scheduled for yester-
day. As of last-evening, the results were unavailable.

The 11-hour operation on the 35-year-old-man took place
71 -days ago on June 28 and was the first time a baboon liver
had ever been used. '

A baboon liver was chosen because baboon tissue is resis-
tant to hepatitis B, with which the male patient is infected.
Hepatitis B destroys liver tissue and any transplanted human
liver would .become infected also.

According to the Health Sciences News‘Bureau, the trans-
plant community in general would not transplant a human

Unions, politicians t/oer at labor dag/parade

Byjason Hilhnan
Editor in Chief

Solidarity was the word as 45,000 people
and over 100 different local unions
marched through the streets of Pittsburgh
yesterday during the United Labor Day
Parade.

The parade, which was split into five dif-
ferent divisions, had a Unity Division,
which included all of the unions affected
by the strike of The Pittsburgh Press called
for by Teamster Local 211.

“I thought [the Unity Division] was a sig-
nificant thing with what we went through
with [The Press] bringing in the scabs. I
think it‘was important for us to have our
own unit so that we could thank the peo-
ple of Pittsburgh for pitching in and help-
ing us so far to win a few battles over at
that company [The Press] over there at the
Boulevard of the Allies,” member of
Teamsters Local 211 Mike Davitt said.

“Our union’s locked out of the newspa-
per, so it’s very important to us that every-
body sticks toget_her,” president of the old-
est labor union in Pittsburgh,
Typographical Union #7, Jim Lowen said.
“When we did have the problem at The
Press, we had just unlimited support from
all the unions all over the city so we
appreciate it.”

University of Pittsburgh’s United Faculty
of Pitt also participated in the parade. “I
had almost 50 people out here today and
we think it’s real important that people
who work at Pitt in all different capacities,
whether professors or secretaries or admin-
istrators or working in construction, partici-
pate with labor and show solidarity, “
President of the union, Mark Ginsburg
said.

Jason Blaney/The Pitt News

Pennsylvania Senatorial“ candidate Lynn Yeakel participated in Pittsburgh's labor

day parade -

“We, just last year, attempted to organize
for collective bargaining and our view is
that some in the administration, in particu-
lar, are strongly against faculty and other
groups trying to organize to improve not
only their own life situation and their
work, but also to improve the university.

“Although now there’s somewhat of an
openness and discussion going on, we
think it’s really important that groups of
people, students, faculty and staff are orga-
nized and are able to gpt their voice out

because we don’t control all of the means
of communication at the university,”
Ginsburg said.

U.S. senatorial candidate Lynn Yeakel
marchedwith the Communication ‘Workers
of America. “That’s one of the unions that’s
endorsed me and they’re just great. They’re
working actively to help me win and it
was great to ride with them in the parade,”
she said.

Yeakel commented on her race with

New bone

marrow
center at

Children ’s
created

By Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor A

A medical br'e'.rkthr'ough has
led to the creation of a bone-
marrow donor sample storage
facility at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

This storage facility is part of
a new National Marrow Donor
Program system for finding it
compatible marrow donor any-
where in the country.
Previously, no national pro-
gram existed.

Bone marrow transplants are
the only hope for thousands of
children and adults with fatal
blood diseases such as
leukemia and aplastic anemia,
according to Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh.

One of the main reasons for
the creation of this “Center of
Excellence,” was the develop-
ment of a new DNA typing sys-
tem to match the person in
need of a marrow transplant
with a’ compatible donor,
according to Children’s.

According to Children’s,
other popular methods of typ-
ing require up to five days for
results at a cost of $450 per
test.

In contrast, the new method
is not only more accurate, but
results are available in eight
hours at a cost of around SSO,
according to Trucco.

“When we have 500,00()
[donors in the data base] the
matching is almost guaranteed,”
Trucco said.

Thecenter already has a list
of 500,000 donors drawn from
the armed forces, Trucco said,
but this list is made up of only
of Caucasian donors. The dif-
ferences in DNA between
Caucasians, African Americans,
Latin Americans and Asians is
sufficiently different to prohibit
transplants between the
groups, according to Trucco.

“The new challenge will be

Suspect still at large for last week's Atwood Streetrobbery

Byjulie Sabol ‘

News Editor

No suspect has been appre-
hended in the robbing of two
female Pitt students that resulted
in a car chase involving three
police agencies, according to
Director of Public Safety William
Brennan.

“Were involved in the investiga-

.C2l1‘

tion, we’ve interviewed the parties
involved and we're trying to come
up with a composite of the male,”
Brennan said.

Two female Pitt students were
waiting in the back of a running
on Atwood Street last
Wednesday night when a male
got into the car, drove the women
to the stadium, robbed, threatened
and released them unharmed, -

according to a police report.

After leaving the car, the victims
ran to gate three of the stadium
and called the police. Police spot-
ted the vehicle, and a car chase
involving the Pittsburgh city,
Pittsbtugh housing authority and
the Pitt police units ensued. The
chase ended with the suspect flee-
ing the vehicle at 2400 Warring
Court. He escaped into the woods

and was not apprehended.
Neither the victims not those
involved in the car chase were
injured.

Though Brennan said it was an
unusual crime, he cautioned stu-
dents to always take safety pre-
cautions. “Be very ‘very careful,
even in cars  make sure your
doors are locked and be percep-
tive to what’s going on around

you, don’t leave your cars with
the motor running.

“A crime will occur when
there’s an opportunity and if you
leave your keys in the car and the
front seat unoccupied, even if
there’s someone in the back,
there’s an opportunity for some-
one to jump in the car and take
off, we’re just very fortunate no
one was hurt."

campaign is in full swing. It has been
rolling all summer long but now we’re
down to the. last 56 days and we’re
working very hard  [Specter] has a lot
more money than I do, but in the end
it’s the voters that vote, not the money. I
believe that the kind of support I’ve got
that you see here, with the unions and

lwith people all across the state, is what’s

going to count  I believe that the vot-
ers are going to go to the polls in rec.ord
numbers and elect me on November the
third. ‘

“The issue is Arlen Specter and his
performance. I got into this race because
I want to retire him. And I think that’s
what the voters of Pennsylvania want. I
am going to be holding Arlen Specter

accountable for his lack of leadership.’

It’s time for new leadership.”

Senator Harris Wofford also participat-
ed in the parade. Heomarched with the
marshalls and sat at the reviewing stand.

“If you just read the newspaper this
very week, you see the highest propor-

Pennsylvania going up. So we ave, I
hope, some energy for the'homestretch,”
Wofford said.

Before the parade started, Local 211
began a letter—writing campaign at the
parade to protest the fact that Horne’s
and Kaufmann’s department stores are
advertising in The A/leg/yen)! Bulletin.

The parade began at 10 a.m. in front
of the Civic Arena. The parade marshalls,
Mayor Sophie Masloff, Commissioner
Tom Foerster and President of United
Labor Paul A. Stackhouse, led the parade
down Centre Avenue. The University of
Pittsburgh Marching Band followed
closely behind, the first band in the
parade. .-

The parade route turned on Fifth
Avenue, which it followed through
downtown until it hit Liberty~Avenue.
The precession turned down Liberty until
it reached the Pittsburgh Hilton, where it
passed the judges who were on a

-reviewing stand.

Unions outside of the newspaper strike

Union, Local 85, which represents the
bus drivers, walked in the parade with
its members bound and gagged. The
union was on strike when the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered the
drivers back to work. It has been 280
days since the drivers have had a con-

‘ tract.

“We seem to be a forgotten group,”
Joe Bartlett, :1 member of Local 85, said.
“This [parade] was ideal for us.”

The Allegheny County Prison
Employees Independent Union also
protested staff cuts to be made on Sept.
13. “These cuts will jeopardize the safety
and security of both the officers, inmates
and the general public. It will lead to
more escapes and more violence in the
prison system,” President John Pastor
said. “Allegheny County Commissioners
have refused to negotiate these
safety issues with us, which we believe
are fundamental rights to any working
man.”

“It’s a big day for labor,” Davitt said.

to also type minorities. The
typing is a little bit different,”
Trucco said.

There is less demand for
minority samples at the
moment, but T rucco said they
urgently need donors from all
the groups to come forward so
they can add them to the data
base.

With the creation of this cen-
ter, Trucco said he anticipates
the need for these samples will
begin to increase. ‘ .

This center was made possi-
ble by a series of important
events:

-Between 1985 and 1986,
funds were obtained for the
Navy to create an indexing sys-
tem to cross-reference marrow
recipients with compatible
donors, according to Children’s.
-In 1988, U.S. Representative
Murtha obtained funding to
convert the U.S Navy’s registry
of marrow donors into a
national registry. This was the
start of the National Bone
Marrow Donor Program.

Donors were gathered from
among military personnel,
according to Murtha.
-In 1990, Murtha was shown a
new method of matching the
marrow donor with the recipi-
ent developed by Trucco.

“When Dr. Trucco said to
me, 2 years ago  that he had
a procedure for indexing [mar-
row donors] at a cheaper price,
and indexing more people
would take less time [than
with the current typing
method], I knew we had to
find the money to make it
available, so that he could go
forward with his project,”
Murtha said.

‘Trucco, originally from Italy,

said that it is only in this coun-
try that a congressional repre-
sentative who is not a scientist
can quickly grasp the concept
of the many practical advan-
tages this new idea could gen-
erate and quickly make avail-
able the resources necessary
for direct-ly implementing this
new approach in a clinical set-
ting.

Problemnot Playboy

Thursday, September third, amidst controversy and
intrigue, Playboy presented its “Girls of the Big East”
issue. Inside of Gus Miller’s Newsstand stood the
young women participating in the issue and some

E young men anxious to meet them, while outside stood

two university organizations — the Campus Women’s
Organization and Men Against Rape — quietly protest-
ed the release of the issue, handed out pamphlets
about the evils of pornography and urged people to
boycott Gus Miller.

The pamphlet said “Porn teaches us that women
want to be dominated and treated as sex objects. Even
when the porn does not seem to be violent, consider

'- the images. When a woman is simply photographed or

videotaped she has become an object. Look at the way
she is posed and positioned. She is a non—human —— an
inviting object waiting for you to do something to it.

-' This objectification shows the real lie and the main

message in pornography: Women want to be violated."

Violence against women is a very important issue. It
should be on the forefront of ‘everybody’s mind. And
we applaud the efforts of these two organizations’. But
our question is, to what extent is Playboy responsible
for this violence against women? The violence against
women is perpetuated first and foremost by the patris—
tic traditions in which women are portrayed in a sub-
servient manner by male role models. Racism, sexism
and homophobia are caused more by the traditions
which reinforce the false sense of superiority of the
“dominating group” than by the A“'pornography [which]
teaches rape behavior.”

-And moreover, it has been stated that pornography

V serves to reinforce theobjectification of women by

men. But what is pornography? Is there a difference
between, say, a painting of a nude woman by

‘Rembrandt, a work of Mapplethorpe and the sexually

explicit pictures in Playboy? Are women exploited and
trivialized in these photographsand in the painting?
When does art become porn and vice versa? The most
important question to consider is actually the.‘ question
of choice. Both the women who posed, and the men
who bought the issue were consenting adults. They
chose to do it.

We do not deny that in this society there is a prob-
lem with the objectification of women. We see it every-
day in beer commercials, the workplace, pornography,
etc. And yes those things do make the fight for femi-

’ nine equality more difficult, But those things are not
' the causes of the problem, they are merely the symp-

toms.
One cures bronchitis by killing the bacteria, not by

. stopping the cough. The bronchitis can manifest itself

into some sort of other sickness which, later down the
road, may be much more dangerous. Killing the bacte-
ria eliminates the cough as well asthe bronchitis.

OH, 11' was

Piece ON
raw LY VaLU€S.

 
   
   

A conservative questions the critics

About a week ago I was lis-
tening to the Rush Limbaugh
radio show when I heard Rush,
whom I consider to be an
excellent spokesman for con-
seivative philosophy, say some-
thing that made me sad. There
was one listener who had
asked him for one solid, legiti-

mate reason Bill Clinton should ’

not be elected. Four years ago‘
[it seems like 400 years] the
same question would have
been met with a barrage of sta-
tistics about the Reagan era and
the incompetence, of Michael
Dukakis. I inched closer to my
radio in my anticipation of
Rush’s response.

“I just have a very hard time
taking anyone the democrats
put up for election seriously,”
were the words I heard uttered

‘ from his lips.

Is this how far the conserva-
tive movement has sunk? Are

we so far in the‘ dumps that the

only thing we have against our
party’s opponent is his parti-
sanship?

Even I have caught myself
engaging in this practice during
an informal discussion of poli-
tics. “C’mon, he’s a democrat.
You can’t honestly say that you
are willing to place the fate of
this country in the hands of a
democrat.”

Folks, if we in the conserva-
tive movement are to have any
hope of keeping in office a
president who is at least some-
what committed to our ideals
(To say that George Bush is a
true conservative is to say that
Penthouse magazine looks for
well-rounded, thoughtful indi-
viduals to grace its pages) we
must keep ourselves from
falling into this trap. We can
only go so long criticizing Bill
Clinton (which is fun, don’t get
me wrong) before someone

asks us why we should vote for
George Bush. If the only

response to this question is “at

least he isn’t Clinton” then we
are in a whole heap of trouble.
So what is there to like about
President Bush? He is definitely
a superior foreign—policy presi-
dent, one of the better one’s
we have had in recent years.
For a long time the United
States had lost militaiy-respect
around the world. The 1980

Nat
Finkin

hostage crisis in Iran, the stand-
off against Libya and Saddam
Hussein’s blatant defiance of
the U.S. and the United Nations
were all indicative of this lack
of respect.

President Bush has helped
bring back a lot of that respect,
and as U.S. planes continue to
fly over the 32nd parallel in
Iraq it is clear that he is firmly
committed to seeing U.N. reso-
lutions compliedwith uncondi-
tionally. The U.S. needs a presi-
dent who is not afraid to back
up U.N. resolutions with mili-
tary force, and George Bush is
that president.

His record on tax increases
has been spectacular. Now,
before everyone’s eyes‘ start to
bulge out, let us understand
that George Bush raised taxes
fewer times during these last
four years than any president in
the last 30 years.

We have to go back to

Dwight Eisenhower to find a.

president so unwilling to raise
taxes. Yes, Bush broke his
promise about new taxes, and
yes, we should hold that
against‘ him. However, his
record, compared against~the

last five or six presidents (even
our beloved Ron)‘ is by far the
best.

- He is firmly committed to
returning the right to control
and regulate abortion to the
states. Now, on a liberal col-
lege campus this may seem like
a definite negative until we see
just how much control Bush
really has over-. abortion.

He cannot make it illegal, and
he cannot appoint Supreme
Court justices that could-make
it illegal. This whole Roe v.
Wade issue has been blown
way beyond what it really
means. In the liberals’ eyes, the
worst case scenario would be a
complete overturning of the
case. If that were to happen,
the state legislatures would
have the right to regulate, out-
law or guarantee the right to an
abortion.

After that, Bush, the court or
anyone else in the federal gov-
ernment couldn’t touch abor-
tion. The states would be able
to decide for themselves, and
that would mean the voters
would decide the issue, once
and for all. —

If we, the conservatives, want
George Bush to be re—elected,
we need to avoid the mud-
slinging that is the trademark of
current politics. His good
points must be emphasized.
These points aren’t going to
appeal to everyone, but past
elections show that conserva-
tive candidates win elections.
The time has come for us to
champion George Bush and to
stop insulting his opponent. If
we can ever get our act in gear
and do that, then we may be
seeing happy days in our future
once again.

LIGHTS OUT

Pitt snuffs out the Golden Flashes 5 1-10 in long awaited night game

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

:-E?) The Kent State Golden

Flashes f1nishedt1—1O last year.
Against such a team, a team
like Pitt just wants to blow the
opponent out, look at some
young .players and try to get
through it healthy.

The Panthers had little trou-
ble with the first two in their
first home night game in over a
year last Saturday. They lit up
the Flash for 51 points and
gave up only 10. Pitt was able
to use much of its bench in the
second half. The third part of
the equation was the problem.

Inside linebacker Tom

P T umulty tore a pectoralis mus-

cle in the game.

“It is a huge blow to our
football teams... we will lose
Tom Tumulty for the season
and that is a tremendous
blow,” head coach Paul
Hackett said. 5 '

Kent looked like it would not
make the blowout part easy
either. Pitt failed to move the
ball on its first possession as
Alex Van Pelt overthrew a‘ wide
open Chris Bouyer on a deep-
ﬂy pattern. , - I

After a Leon Theodorou punt
into the end zone gave Kent
the ball at its’ 20-yard line,
Flash tailback Troy Robinson
ripped off a 64-yard run to the
Panther 16. Robinson gained
only 75 yards all of last season.
The defense held there and
Kent scored only a field goal
on a 28-yard kick by Mike
Benzy.

Pitt continued to struggle
offensively, punting after three
running plays on its next pos-
session. ._

» “Their plan defensively to
challenge Alex Van Pelt was
rather unusual,” Hackett said,
“We have not faced one of
those game plans in the three

years that we have been run-
ning this offense. It took us a
while to get on track.

“They put nine men on the
line of scrimmage and when
you do that it is nearly impossi-

_ble to run the ball,” Hackett

said. “I was delighted by a cou-
ple of the runs that Curtis
[Martin] had, because there
really _was no place to go. We
knew what we had to do. Just
give us enough time  the
defense held on  and we

were able to sort it out.”
Tumulty and defensive end

Jeff Esters stuffed Kent runners
in the backfield on consecutive
plays as the defense got the
ball right back for Pitt and the
offense went to work.

Two Van Pelt completions
and four runs by Martin for 21

yards set up the Panthers at the

Kent 17. A Mike Miller sack put
Pitt back to the 29. Van Pelt,
under pressure again, threw a
high pass into double coverage
and Martin came down with it
in the end zone. Sean Conley’s
extra point made the score 7-3
Pitt.

On the next play from scrim-
mage, Pitt nose tackle Tom
Barndt forced a Robinson fum-
ble, and strong safety Doug
Whaley recovered to set the
Panthers up at the Kent 12-yard
line. T wo plays later, Van Pelt
found tight end Rob Coons on
a clear—out pattern to the right
side for the touchdown.

Pitt got the ball for the first’
— time in the second quarter at its

own 23 after a long punt return
by Dave Nottoli wascalled
back for a clipping call. It did
not matter as Van Pelt hit an
obscenely open Jermaine
Williams on a short swing pass
which the backup tailback ran

‘the rest of the way for a 77-

yard touchdown. It tied the

third longest pass play in Pitt

Pitt Soccer team suffers tough losses
Pant/oers mppea’ 3-2 by Calzfornia, 2-1 by Buc/enell

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer’ team got off to a bittersweet
start in the 1992 season, dropping one—goal
games to California University (Pa) and Bucknell
University despite outplaying its opponents in
both games. * —

Sunday at Pitt Stadium,’ Pitt couldn’t quite
recover from a 3-0 deficit in the first half -——_
courtesy of three bad goals —— falling 3-2 to
Bucknell in the team’s ‘92 home opener. On
Saturday, California State got the most of its five
shots’, scoring twice to defeat Pitt 2-1 at
California. A

In both games, the Panthers dominated play
offensively, but fell prey to crucial defensive
breakdowns and several missed opportunities to
let victory slip away.

“We made three mistakes (against Bucknell),”
Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher said. “We didn’t
clear the ball on the first goal, and we put one
in our own goal. _ I V I
 ‘,‘Wejust_ did stupid .th_ihgs today.”

Two of the three Bison scores were actually
netted by Panther defenders — one on a deflec-
tion, the other a poor clearvby senior Brian
Pellegrino that careened over the head of Pitt
keeper‘ Kirk Brodows. Bucknell’s first goal came
on a 35-yard blast from forward Alex Kogan — a
half-hearted shot at goal that should have never
nestled the back of the net, according to
Luxbacher. _

“Definitely, that first goal was a bad goal,”
Luxbacher said. “That long shot should’ve never
gone in. 4 i I

"You can't give up bad goals and expect to
win.”

Brodows was replaced at halftime by first-year
goalie Adam Spitzer, who finished the game and
gave Pitt a chance to win with a shutout effort.

After the defensive faux pas, Pitt did all it
could to crawl out of the 3-0 hole, scoring two
quick goals just before halftime. Senior. forward
Scott Alexander came off the bench to provide
an immediate spark, setting up both Panther
goals with deft passing and non—stop hustle.

Volleyball teamdrops
three to ranked teams

By Cory Walborn _
Staff_Writer

The Pitt volleyball team
was looking down the barrel
of a loaded shotgun this
past weekend as it faced
three Top 20 teams in
Lincoln, Nebraska. The
young and inexperienced
Pan_thers lost ,all three
matches but never winced at
the big guns in front of
them.

“We went into a very
tough situation and came
out a better team,” Pitt head
coach Sue Woodstra said
about her team’s perfor-
mance in its season—opening
losses at the Nebraska tour-
nament.

'Lucanie. Lucanie collected‘

“We played three very
solid teams and it was a
tough way for us to start this
season,” Woodstra said. “But
we are just getting our feet
wet.”

Opening up against fifth-
ranked Pacific University on
Friday, the Panthers started
out poorly and dropped the
opening game 15-0. Games
two and three were not
much better as Pacific ram-
bled its way to beat Pitt 15-6
in each of the last two
games.

the Panthers was junior out-

A’ bealtloy Martin gets Pan

  

 

1':

 

 

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Staff Writer

When Curtis Martin went
down with a toe injury during
the Notre Dame game last sea-

‘ son, a great deal of Pitt’s offen-

sive productivity went down
with him.

Many pointed to the loss of
Martin as the main reason for
Pitt’s dissappointing finish.

Despite the setback which
cost him three full games of his
first season, Martin ran for
556 yards on 114 carries,
including three 100-yard plus
efforts. -

' He returned and closed the
season with an impressive 85-
yard effort against a rugged
Penn State defense, while

_ Sopeneing enough eyes around
5  the nation to earn second team

Freshman All-American status
from the Football News.

Now that Martin is healthy _

again, Pitt expects a balanced
attack, and .if Saturday night’s
performance against Kent is
any indication, an attack that’s
not only balanced, but potent

0’ _. and proliﬁc as well.

The sophomore tailback from
Pittsburgh’s Allderdice High
School showed no efffects of
the toe injury or hamstring

_ injury that slowed him during

fall camp, carrying 18 times for
80 yards and three touch-
downs, while adding a fourth
touchdown on a 29-yard pass
play from Alex Van Pelt.

Kent employed a defense
that should have negated the
Pitt running game somewhat,
stacking nine players along the

line of scrimmage most of the .

time.

Pitt head coach Paul Hackett
said the Panthers had not faced
this type of alignment in his
three seasons, and credited
Martin for making things hap-
pen against the stacked front.

“I was delighted by a couple
of the runs that Curtis had
because there was really no
place to go,” Hackett said.

“I just didn’t know that they
were as good as they are. They
-proved me wrong,” Martin said
of the Kent defense.

Martin scored Pitt’s first
touchdown, making _a nice
catch in double—coverage on a
29-yard pass play where Van
Pelt seemed to be off—balance,
in trouble and underthrew him
slightly. .

“I didn’t think that Alex had
seen me. I was waving. my
arm,” he said. “I tried to decoy
as if the ball wasn’t coming to
me and tried to turn around
and catch the ball at the

Oilers slick enough to win
weakest division in football

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

The Pittsburgh Steelers pulled off the shock of
the first week of the NFL season as they upset
the Houston Oilers Sunday. That could be an
indication of how well the Steelers have come
together or how bad the AFC central really is.

The division has regained its status as the
worst division in football and despite Sunday’s
loss, Houston is the most talented and stable
team in it. i '
Houston Oilers: Quarterback Warren Moon
leads an explosive offense that seems unstop-
pable at times. The offensive line, anchored by
All-Pros Bruce ‘Mathews and Mike Munchak, is
as good as there is. Lorenzo White may finally
be ready to become a star now that Alan Pinkett
has been traded to New Orleans.

The question mark is at wide receiver. The
Oilers had the best group in football last season,
but Drew Hill left for Atlanta via Plan—B free
agency and took his 90 catches with him.
Speedster Tony Jones also flew off to the
Falcons, leaving this group a bit thin for a run-
and—shoot team. Moon will be better than he
was on Sunday (5 interceptions), but he will
miss Hill all season.

The defense is also missing some people. The
holdouts of Pro Bowlcornerback Chris Dishman

. and defensive ends Sean Jones and Al.Fuller

leave them shoithanded. Those three plus line-
men Ray Childress and Lee Williams, linebackers
Lamar Lathon and Al Smith, and safety Bubba
McDowell form a strong defense. Dishman is

desperately needed in a secondary which was

already a weak spot.

The Oilers should win the division and are
definite Super Bowl contenders, but with Moon
turning 36 during this season, this could be their
best and last chance. .

Pittsburgh Steelers: The rest of the AFC Central
did not look like much going into this season.
Those who picked the Steelers for second place

i did so by default, but this may just be a good

team. If you disagree, just ask the Oilers.
Neil O’Donnell has taken charge of the quar-
terbackijob. If his teammates do their jobs, he

' will do his. Jeff Graham has stepped up after a

disastrous rookie year to do what the Steelers
expected when they drafted him in the second
round last year. Eric Green and Adrian Cooper
are outstanding at tight end. Burner Dwight

Stone has made himself into a solid receiver.

The offensive line is still coming together, but
could be very good. Barry Foster continues to
show that he can be a lot better than when he is
healthy. This group is very capable of running
offensive coordinator Ron Earhart’s grind-it—out
attack effectively.

With that offense, strong defense is a must.
Greg Lloyd and Jerrol Williams lead an outstand-
ing group of linebackers. The secondary is solid
now that Rod Woodson is back to All—Pro form
after a down year. The defensive line is still a
problem, but they are better than last year.

Those who predicted doom in Bill Cowher’s
first year must have forgotten that this team just
barely missed the playoffs the last two years.
They have improved enough that they could get
over the hump this year.

Cleveland Browns: This team should be so
lucky. Bill Bellicheck made the defense
respectable last year, but they still need a lot of
help. ;

The defense is the_team’s strength. Michael
Dean Perry is getting healthy just in time for the
season, but one great player will not be enough.
The Browns were 21st in the league in run
defense last season and still do not have much
in the front seven. Eric Turner came. on late in
the year and looked like a futurevstar at safety,
but the secondary has also lost a key player with
cornerback Frank Minnifield on injured reserve
with a urinary ailment.

The offense is a mess. Bernie Kosar looked
like his old self last ‘year, but he needs targets.
Reggie Langhorne is gone to P1an—B, Brian
Brennan was cut, and Webster Slaughter is hold-
ing out. What remains are Michael Jackson, ex-
Buccaneer Bruce Hill, draft picks Patrick Rowe
of San Diego St. [second round] and Rico Smith
of Colorado. Battered Mark Bavaro and retread
Pete Holohan are the tight ends.

The worst part is the offensive line. Top pick
Tommy Vardell could help the running game,
but Cleveland needs people to block for them.
Recently acquired All—Pro Jay Hilgenberg will not
be enough to save a group that just gave up 11
sacks to the Colts.The Browns have far too many
holes to fill and could be one of the worst teams
in football.

Cincinnati Bengals; Rookie coach David
Shula’s crew will probably be just as bad. They

Pitt’s offensive line, a

Martin said. They get the

Tumulty  

Continued from page 9
Pitt’s fierce one-two defensive punch.

Coming off a super first year that saw
Tumulty become only the fifth first—year
player in Pitt history to start the opening
game of his first season, Tumulty fit the
high expectations he had coming out of
Penn Hills High.School.

Tumulty opened last season with 11
tackles vs. West Virginia and continued his
success with a season team—high of 15
tackles against Southern Mississippi the fol-
lowing week.

Tumulty ended the year by finishing
third on the team with 84 tackles and start-
ed in all 11 games. .

These accomplishments enabled Tumulty
to win the Big East Rookie-of-the-Year
award, ECAC’s Rookie-of—the-Year award,
and helped in his selection to the Football
News’ second-team Freshman All-America
squad.

So Tumulty’s expectations for his sopho-
more year were even higher. He was a
year older, a year stronger, and a year
wiser.

Tumulty was a preseason nominee for
the 1992 Butkus Award, given to the

nation’s top linebacker.

He was going to be a defensive leader
and be the “glue” that would hold together
a defense minus the National Football
League departed Sean Gilbert and Keith
Hamilton.

“He is probably further along at this
point in his career than anyone I have
ever coached,” inside linebacker coach
Sal Sunseri said before the season
began.

But for now all these expectations for
Tumulty are on hold. He has a torn pec-
toralis muscle that will keep him out of
action for at least eight months.

“Tom will be redshirted,” Hackett said.
‘ilts a tough day, we all know what Tom
meant to us.”

“But Tom will still make his contribu-
tions,” Hackett added. “If not on the field
then on the sidelines.” ’

With #84 on the sidelines the #43 of
Hayes Clark will be on the field. Clark, a
junior, will get the starting nod this week
against West Virginia.

-Clark is now being called upon to do
Tumulty’s job, a job that will be tougher to
fill in more ways than one.

‘‘We’ll be losing more than a player on
the field, we’ll be losing a friend,” Clark
said of Tumulty’s misfortune. “We will miss
Tom a lot.”

Missing Tumulty is what all 1() Pitt
defenders will do, but life goes on.

Life went on after Gilbert and Hamilton
left the Pitt defense to fill two huge
voids.

So now another void needs to be filled.
This is different. Tumulty is not in the NFL,
but still at Pitt. His intensity on the field

will still be around, though on the side- _

lines.

Tumulty’s loss will hurt Pitt, no doubt
about it. There is also no doubt that, as
Hackett pointed out, Tumulty will be
back with three years of eligibility -remain-
ing.

But for this season Tumulty is gone.
Hayes Clark is now called in to do the job
with no questions asked. ‘

Clark said he is up for the challenge just
as Tumulty was a year ago against West
Virginia.

“I will have to be intense [this weekend
against WVUl,” Clark said. “I will have to
be around the ball, just like Tom.”

presented, namely the Kent
defense, by ringing up passing
numbers reminiscent of his bril-
liant Panther debut year in
1989 — 11 completions in 17
attempts, 270 yards passing,
three touchdowns [three T D’s
tying a career high].

But unlike most gaudy Van
Pelt afternoon’s, these numbers

'don’t tell the true story of how

the San Antonio, Tx.‘ native
played. Or the importance of
playing Kent State in the ‘92
season opener  instead of
Ohio State. '

Despite the numbers ——
which were enhanced by two
leaping grabs by Dietrich Jells
and tailback Jermaine Williams’
77-yard catch—and-run -—— there
were rust chips evident after
several Van Pelt passes.

He overthrew wideouts
Chris Bouyer and Bill Davis on
the team’s opening possession
and missed a sure six points by
overthrowing a wide-open
Davis on what would have

 
  
   
   

he missed another touchdown
bomb by underthrowing Jells.

His all-too-frequent misfires
weren’t ignored by Pitt head
coach Paul Hackett, who antici-
pated some bumps in Van
Pelt’s road to 100 percent effec-
tiveness.

“Alex was not sharp at all,”
Hackett said. “[This game] is a
great test for him. A great
wakeup cal.l for him.

“[He’sl gotta hit the deep
ones.” '

Neither Van Pelt nor Hackett
blamed the scattershot deep
throws on the elbow lpain,
relapse, etc.] — in fact, Hackett
says his quarterback’s whole
body is in better shape.

But it is the mental side of
the game, trusting all facets of
his game, that needs to be
honed. And what a better way
to work out the rust — to reac-
climate your prized offensive
weapon to playing with the
Jells’ and Davis’ of Panther
football — than by playing

posed no threat to the health of
Pitt’s prized QB [he was sacked
once for a 12-yard loss].

Rather, they challenged him
— all but daring him to pass by
lining up nine guys on the line
of scrimmage to thwart the run-
ning game. That strategy
ensured less of the defenses
attention on Van Pelt, which in
turn drew Van Pelt’s attention v
towards his best weapon: play
action pass. ‘

And though the deep ball
amplified Van Pelt’s apparent
rustiness, it was the opportuni-
ty to throw the bomb via play
action —— with little pressure —
that gave the Pitt QB chance
after chance to work on his
game.

It is better to show rustiness
than to not get the chance to
work on something that obvi-
ously needs work.

Call it injury-free practice in a
game situation. Dress rehearsal
on opening night.

It made for the perfect oppo-

season of surgery, rest, rehab '
and murmured talk throughout
the Oakland campus about the
condition of that cherished
right arm.

The murmurs should be dead
by now; replaced by patience
and faith that Van Pelt is
healthy and will be the man
come October and November,
when the opponent is Penn
State and Syracuse  and not
Kent.

Saturday’s win will not be
remembered as one of Pitt’s
greatest opening wins in histo-
ry. Pitt fans will be hard
pressed to remember Kent 
or Kent State  or whoever 
a month from now. But with a
commodity as valuable as Alex
Van Pelt, the experience. and
the nature of the game —— con-
sidering the. circumstances —— it
may be Pitt's most important

opening day trial in a long

time.

Continued from page 9

Alexander connected with midfielder
Eric Prex — the team's leading scorer a
year ago — on a sweet run through the
middle of the Bucknell defense, result-
ing in a tripping penalty inside the box
for the penalty kick call. Prex finished
off the play by burying the penalty kick
past Bison goalie Mark Wrigley to make
it 5~1. ,

For Alexander, the role of team spark-
plug is a role he and the other Pitt for-
wards are expected to play this year.

“Coach [Luxbacher] wants the people
up from working real tough,” Alexander
said. "Just scrapping around, winning all
the head balls — wreak havoc in the
back.”

Pitt’s second goal also came courtesy
of Alexander’s relentless scrapping. The
Glenshaw native raced the right sideline
to beat the Bison defender to the ball,
then offered a scoring chance to
Panther forward \Valt_er Lamory as he
was falling to the Pitt Stadium turf.
Lamory came up aces with a shot
through Wrigley’s five—hole to cut the
deficit to one.

With momentum in tow, Pitt proceed-
ed to pelt the Bucknell defense the rest
of the half with shot after shot. Their

‘best chance: first—year forward Eric

Duffy narrowly missed knotting‘ the
score at three, shooting wide of goal
after dribbling past Wrigley and-bring-
ing the Bison keeper to the ground.

Luxbacher was pleased with the
comeback effort.

“I give the guys credit,” Luxbacher
said. “We were down 3-zip on three
had goals and come back and had a
chance.”

Despite the opportunities, the score

remained 3-2 at halftime, and unfortu-
nately for the Panthers, that’s how the
game would end.

It was not being able to capitalize on
scoring chances, and the defensive
breakdowns, that proved fatal to
Luxbacher and company, who saw two
potential “W’s” go by the boards.

“We should have scored one at the
end of the half,” Luxbacher said.
“Yesterday’s game was the exact same
thing ——- we dominated the game  and
didn’t get the win.

“The effort was there, but a loss is a
loss — as simple as that.”

On Saturday, Pitt outshot California
(Pa) 15-5, but fell 2-1 as the Vulcans’
scored on their only shots from inside
the penalty box. After a first-half
Panther goal by forward Jeff Porter
[assist to Prex], California responded
with two mid—second half scores to steal
a victory. Of the two losses, Luxbacher
said the Cal- defeat was the harder of
the two for him to take.

“Yesterday was worse,” Luxbacher
said. “We really dominated the game.

“Our experience, you would think,
would not lead to mistakes. But 
experienced guys did stupid things.”

One experienced guy who thinks the
mistakes are nothing but a short-term
thing is defender Bob Dyer, a sopho-
more who started all 17 Pitt games last
year.

“As long as we’ve been working hard
— we’ve been working real hard in
practice —— we’ll be fine,” Dyer said.
“We’re beating [our opponent] to the
ball, we’re getting the opportunities. It’s
not the effort on the field —— it’s mental
errors. ”

Dyer thinks the bad luck against

12

Scott Alexander's (18) relentless effortwas not enough to net a victory. The

Bucknell and California (Pa.) will pro-

vide the team, particularly its newcoma

ers, with perspective and determination
for Providence and Boston College. The
result could be two Big East wins ——

’ Panthers dropped matches to Calif. of Pa. and Bucknell last weekend.

something Pitt didn’t experience in
1991.

“Our adrenaline is gonna be running
high,” Dyer said. “I think we’re gorma

attack percentage.

“Ann [Lucanie] is one of the
premier players in the country,”
Woodstra said. “She is definite-
ly leading the team both physi-
cally and emotionally.”

But not even Lucanie’s efforts
could help the Panthers handle
Pacific. Pitt had a dismal attack
percentage of .089 coupled
with 25 hitting errors that
sealed the Panthers fate.

In its second match against
sixth—ranked host Nebraska, Pitt
continued to struggle but
showed signs of improvement.
Losing 15-7, 15-4 and 15-5, the
Panthers attack percentage was
a low .026, but they had out-

standing contributions made by

first—year players Alyssia Yanik
and Sara Mitchell.

“Our first—year girls showed a
lot of character,” Woodstra
said. “They were very nervous
and played inconsistently but
improved tremendously against
Nebraska.”

Nebraska got big games out
of Stephanie T hater and Allison
Weston. Thater had 15 kills
while Weston paced the
Cornhuskers with 17.

Nebraska also tallied a total
of 18 blocks and 47 digs which
enabled it to dominate all three
games.

Lucanie again led Pitt with 16
kills and 10 digs but was offset
by her tearn’s 30 hitting errors
[including 10 by Lucanie.

Those 5 errors hurt the
Panthers offense and allowed
the Huskers to sweep all three
games.

Pitt’s third and final match of
the weekend came against

Panthers dropped the first
game 15-9 but continued to
improve. In the second game
the improvement finally paid
off as first—year player Sarah
Mikla led Pitt to a 15-12 win.

Showing their youth and
inconsistency, the Panthers
couldnot produce the same
results in the next two games.
Losing by the exact same score
of 15-6 in games three and
four, Pitt left Nebraska with no
wins and three losses.

Despite the three defeats at
the hands of three nationally-
ranked teams, there were plen-
ty of hopeful signs coming out
of this tournament.

Lucanie was named to the
All—Tournament team and
showed the nation’s best that
she is healthy [after off—season
ankle surgery] and at the top of
her game.

Sophomore setter Annemarie
Mernagh revealed that her con-
sistent play is becoming a
trademark to Pitt’s offensive
game. Mernagh tallied 101
assists and contributed 18 digs
on defense in the tournament.

But the most impressive signs

came from the young and inex-_

perienced first—year players.
Yanik, Mitchell and Mikla all
performed well and gained
valuable experience needed for
the rest of the season.

“Extremely positive,”
Woodstra said of her feelings
after the tournament. “We start-
ed four totally inexperienced
players and positive things still
came about.”

“These [first—year players]
could have come home with
their tails between their legs,
but they didn’t,” Woodstra said.

lead.

The next Panther drive did
not take much longer. Van Pelt
underthrew wide receiver
Dietrich Jells, who had gotten
behind the Kent defense, but
the sophomore wide receiver
made an outstanding catch for
a 45-yard gain.

Martin completed the drive
with a 17-yard touchdown
run. ‘

Disasters on the Kent punting
team set up two more scores.
First, the Kent punter put his
knee down fielding a snap,
giving Pitt the ball at Kent’s
11. ‘

Vince Williams went in from
the one-yard line to make the
score 35-3 Pitt.

Cliff Moncrief blocked Kent’s
next punt, setting up a one-
yard run by Martin to run the
count to 42—3.

Kent made a bit of a run
early in the third quarter, taking
the opening kickoff 72 yards
on 15 plays and seven minutes
ending in a one—yard touch-
down run by quarterback
Kevin Shuman.

“lKent coach Pete Cordelli
should be commended for] his
ability to prepare his team to
open the second half,” Hackett
said. “He did a better job than I
did. We were not ready for the‘
second half. His football team
clearly was ready.”

Passes from Van Pelt to

touchdown, this one a ‘Martin

score came on a 31-yard field
goal by Conley.

Chad Dukes, a junior transfer
from Dean Junior College,
set up the score with a 43-yard
run to the 17 of the
Flashes. _

Pitt racked up the kind of
numbers expected from a game
against an opponent like Kent.
Van Pelt hit on 11 of 17 passes
for 270 yards and three touch-
downs.

"Martin ran for 80 yards and
three touchdowns on 18 carries
and caught a pass for another
score. ‘

T umulty was the defensive
standout before the injury with
nine tackles,_all in the first half.
His replacement, Hayes Clark,
had eight stops.

Cornerback Vernon Lewis

had an interception and-

Hackett still argues that Chris
Hupko had one, but the refer-
ees did not agree. ‘

Pitt had a shaky day on spe-
cial teams. They had penalties
on two punt returns, muffed
another and failed on an extra
point. They got a strong game
from Conley, the senior walk-
on kicker. ,.

“Conley did what we hoped
he would do,” Hackett said.
“The kickoffs were just what
we needed and the PAT s and
field goal were solid.”

Pitt won big against a team
they should beat by a large
margin, but it was not a total
success with the loss of a
key defensive player like
Tumulty.
