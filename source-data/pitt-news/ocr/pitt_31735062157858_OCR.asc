L3-Xity in Policing A i 
Besides. the multiple voting,
Workmaster claimed there’ was
carelessness in the policing of the

voting areas and in the transport-_ .;
ing of ballot boxes to the ‘dean,-

of men’s office for counting.

Speciﬁcally he said that un-‘.11?-
authorized persons were permit-.
ted near unwatched ballot boxes; .i

a box of Bus Ad votes was dis-
covered after. ‘the ‘counting; a
Pharmacy School ballot box was”

It is doubtful if it will order a D .
reelection on the basis of the evi- 

dence now offered.

It is probable that Congress will
vote to investigate the matter fur-
ther. Or it may decide to take no

action at all. 

The result of last week’s- elec- '
tion was ,a sweeping decision for ’
the fraternities. Theytook all the ,.

Ben Grady, faculty advisor to
the demonstration block, has ad-
vised the appointments committee
If that he wants a chairman who
more ﬁts the requirements of a
' “top, sergeant” than anything else.
'3 Mr. Grady said that a good

ty are what he wants for next

take over the block and has many

Pitt a busy afternoon.

The Panthers will have a decid-

ed advantage in practice and.

match competition. The clay courts
at Washington have hampered the
Prexie practice sessions and their

only scheduled match against
Bethany last week was rained out.

In a home-and-home series last
year, the two teams split. The
Panther win on the Westinghouse

courts was the lone W&J setback’

of the year.

Assistant coach Ben Grady will
take the same players to Washing-
ton that lost to Ohio State. John-
ny Lohstoetter, Stan Weil, Wait
Schoenberger, J o e Rauterkus,
Ralph Mason, and Bob Silberstein
will be out to make it two wins in

three starts. ‘
