Municipal Oﬂicials

Mayor Scully Proposes Plan to Enroll
Seniors, Graduates in Government

By VVilliam L. Klinkenstein
Considerable interest has been shown at the University in the
plans of Mayor Cornelius D. Scully to place senior and graduate
students in various ﬁelds of municipal government as “internes in

public service.’ ’

Planned to fulﬁll a three-fold purpose of providing the city

with research services now lack-
ing, giving University students
practical experience in govern-
ment service, and developing a
reservoir of well-trained, experi-
enced persons from which per-
manent civil servants may be
chosen, the Mayor’s program has
been “enthusiastically” received by
Dr. William S. McEllroy, dean of
the School of Medicine, and met the
general approbation of others in-
cluding Chancellor John G. Bow-
man. L
Seven Point Program »

In presenting his seven-point pro-
gram to the Chancellor, the Mayor

enumerated speciﬁc problems which,

could be investigated by the stu-
dents selected under the plan.

“A speciﬁc program in which the
medical school could be of immense
value to the community at this
time lies in that ﬁeld, for instance,
the anti-syphilis campaign, anti-
T. B., etc,” the plan stated.

In order to accomplish his ob-
jectives, the Mayor proposed this:

1. Research apprenticeships be
offered to seniors and graduate stu-
dents who have shown particular
aptitude and interest in the prob-
lems of government. These appren-
ticeships will carry- awards of $150
for a period of eight months to cov-
er the student’s expenses.

2. Student apprentices will be
selected by the heads of the various
departments from which the stu-
dents come. _

3. Supervision of the work of
student researchers will be exer-

New York Plan

‘A plan similar to that proposed
by Mayor Scully has been institut-
ed in New York since 1938. Govern-
ment, economics, history, sociology,
and economics students are select-
ed for work with the city during
the summer months.

Subject studied under the New
York plan, which is supervised by
William B. Herlands. commissioner
of investigation, include prison
studies, research on city planning,
consolidation of pensions, milk
prices, housing, bi-partisan elec-
tions, migration of industries, and
others.

No action has been taken by the
University on Mayor Scully’s plans,
although a general outline of them
has been circulated among various
departments mentioned in the pro-
gram.

If You Don t——

It’s a swell life if you don’t weak-

ing, you February freshmen, and
according to fraternity men, it’s
even, better if you do weaken.

So says Jim Kennedy, C41, presi-
dent of Interfraternity Council,
whose rushing season will ofﬁcially
begin at 3 o’clock tomorrow morn-
ing and extend to 2 o’clock Sunday
morning. During these three days
a wide variety of dinners, dances

and parties will be held at the vari-
ous fraternity houses.

« Perhaps the most amazing feat to
be attempted is that by a group of
boys over Bayard street way, who

Marshals Clear Stairs
Of University Lunchers

Although they have no other place to eat, over 300» students are being
warned every day by the University’s marshals to move from the eighth-

ﬂoor steps.

The overﬂow of students in the ground ﬂoor Tuck Shop has been

eased somewhat by use of 24 Ca-
thedral. There will be, however,
no move to provide additional room
for those students who eat, or try
to eat, in the eighth ﬂoor Tuck
Shop during the rush between 12:30
and 1:15 o’clock daily.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men who ordered removal of the
lunch-munchers from the steps, de-
clared that the problem could be
cleared up without any assistance
from the dean of men’s ofﬁce, if the
students would take it upon them-
selves to eat at times other than the
rush hour.

When asked about available space
on any of the other 41 stories of
the Cathedral for students who
cannot elbow their way into the
shop during rush periods, Dr. Lan-
fear stated that it was not within
his jurisdiction to know of suitable
space on other ﬂoors. He added
that he“was in favor of consolidating
the shops around the eighth ﬂoor
instead of doing more to spread
them throughout the Cathedral.

Dr. Lanfear concluded, “I know
it is a problem, but my sympathy
is entirely with the students.”

William Daufenbach, assistant to
the dean of men, declared that his
marshals would continue Clearing
the lunch-eaters from the Stairs

‘and from rooms which are not pro-

vided as eating places.

Schaffner Builds
Mechanical Dryer A

A device for drying materials
mechanically called by the chem
engineering students “Schaffner’s
Little Giant Ice Box,” has saved
the University about $750.

Built by Robert M. Schaffner, in-
structor in chemical; engineering,
and his students, the “Little Mar-
vel” was a homemade job which
might have cost the University a to-
tal of $1,400 new. Work began on
the mechanical dryer last October,
and despite semester exams, is
scheduled to make its appearance
next week.

The machine regulates _both hu-
midity and temperature 1n drying
such things as organic gelatin or
lumber.

The dryer is to be used to study
water evaporation for thesis work,
which will be a continuation of
Schaffner’s experiment at West Vir-
ginia university.

“a feature spread.” v ~

. Well, that’s what- happened last
Monday night at Heinz House when
six out of the 11 fraternities com-
peting for sing honors used, as their

themes, satires of rival fraternities.

When it was all over, Theta Phi
Alpha for their presentation of “The
Gold Rush” was discovered holding
the ﬁrst prize trophy. Awarded
second and third place, respectively
were Kappa Alpha Theta "who
swung out the story about “'1‘l1‘e
Discovery of Electricity” and the
Chi Omegas who gave their mod-
ernized version of “The Witchcraft
Trials of Salem.”

Featured in the winning skit was
Patsy Grifﬁth, C40, who mocked Al-
pha Delta Pi, and Jane Epping,
BA40, who gave an imitation of the
Kappas. The top performance was
that of Mary Jane Firth, ED4l, with
her ribbing of the jumpin’ jivin’
Kappa Alpha Thetas.

Other fraternity‘ satirists were
Delta Delta Delta who enacted “The
Fountain of Youth;” Kappa Kappa
Gamma in “Drums Along The M0-
hawk;” and Phi Sigma Sigma in
“Panhellenic Paul Revere’s Ride”
which demonstrated the strife be-
tween independents and fraternity
women.

Delta Zeta presented “The
Declaration of Independence;” Zeta
Tau Alpha, “The Boston Tea
Party;” Alpha Delta Pi, “Napo-
leon;” Beta Sigma Omicron, “Betsy
Ross and the Panhellenic Flag;” and
Alpha Epsilon Phi, “Martha Wash-
ington Goes to Pitt.”

Oh yes, just before the meowing

began Marjorie Kuhbach, C40,
chairman of the Sing, gave an in-
troductory speech in which she

spoke of the friendly spirit fostered
among the fraternities by Pan-
hellenic Association.

They Only Want
To Eat Luneh

We meant to be subtle in our editorial Wed-
nesday, but not that subtle. VVe meant to hint
that there should be no more lunching on the
eighth ﬂoor stairs, but we didn’t mean to obscure
our proposal that the fellows who eat there be
given. another place to go.

Unfortunately, that’s what happened. Those
bright souls around here skimmed nicely across
what we wrote, and promptly went out and ig-
nored it. Instead of making 828 available or pro-
viding another place with tables and chairs to
take care of the overﬂow from the Tuck shops, the
order went out to merely keep students off the
steps and out of the classrooms.

So the University marshals are spending the
ﬁfth hour making it still more uncomfortable for
a lot of fellows to eat lunch.

There was a proposal that those using the
eighth ﬂoor Tuck Shop stagger their times of using
the room._ The only way that We Can S66 ‘D0 <10
any st.aggering within the forty minutes of the
ﬁfth hour is to establish an assembly line system:
one minute for a sandwich, two for a bottle of milk,
and so on. =‘ .

It is silly that in a forty-two story building
there should be so little space that those who ,CaI'1'Y

their lunches should have to be chased, while eater
ing, from the stairs to the eighth ﬂoor hall where‘

they sit now. ,
Quite frankly, if we were one of those who

lunched in or near the eighth ﬂoor Tuck Shop, we’d',
organize a little committee tomorrow to get some

satisfaction on this matter.

Some Thoughts
On Bushing

Second-semester men’s fraternity rushing sea-
son begins tomorrow and extends through Satur-

day evening. ’

is a misnomer
Fraternity men at Pitt are traditionally
poor rushers.

The word “rushing ’
here.

They seldom resort to the rushing tactics com-
1110111)’ employed by their contemporaries on other
campi. Fraternity men at the University merely
invite prospective pledges to the chapter houses
so that all concerned may become acquainted.
V\"hich is as it should be.

All students socially, scholastically and ﬁnan-
cially eligible for initiation to a fraternity should
participate in the rushing season with a seriousness
bordering on the severe. “Going fraternity” is no
light phrase nor just another means of having some
college fun. Fraternity men take their varied in-

terests and activities seriously, and they expect

,_ their guests to do the same.

Prospective initials should attend the Qliﬁerent
social affairs with every fun urge set to be satis-
ﬁed, but they should not be inﬂuenced by elaborate
attempts at entertainment.

As mother would say—“I-lave a good time, but

' be careful.”

“Lay Down Clancy!
You’re Dead”

_ President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced
something quite new into the democratic processes
when he told the American Youth Congress that
young people ought to stop making resolutions
about peace, and about the way to keep America
out of war. This sort of thing, he felt, was better
done by experts.

The idea reminds us of the story of the Irish-
man who, after the doctor had pronounced ‘him
dead, sat up shouting ‘‘I’m not dead! I’m not
dead!”

“Lay down, Clancy,” said his wife, “you don’t
know what you’re talking about. If the doctor
says you’re dead, you’re dead; he ’s an expert in
such matters.”

And just like Clancy, about all the President
has left for the young people of America to do is to
lay down and die. The experts will do the talking.

they are going to do it too.

Politics

 

W0mcn’s Fraternities

Cause Political Uproar

The twelfth—ﬂoor “no-politics pledge” was two
Weeks old this morning.

Although much yet remained to be explained con-
cerning the now-famous clean politics move—sponsored
by the women’s Fraternity.Presidents’ Council——campus
political observers this week were reviewing the train
of events that has attempted to lift sororities, at least
the twelve “puriﬁed” houses, fromv the “impasse of
block voting and rotten politics?’ to. a high ‘plane of

,merit and purity in student government.

The news-making no-politics‘ pledge ﬁrst received
active consideration during mid-semester vacation, Miss
-Helen Wilson, C40, president of FPC, in reviewing the

history of the measure, explained. However, she said
the proposal has been up for: c.onsideration in sorority
~ circles many times. in recent years.

Fraternity Presidents’ Council, which ‘authored the
sorority clean-up, is ‘,‘an informal discussion group,”
according to Miss Wilson, and is composed of the presi-
dents of the sixteen accredited campus sororities.

"Although the organization functions without a consti-
_ tution, it is not a new body as is commonly believed

on campus; but according to Miss Wilson, it has been
organized for years. I

The no-politics proposal was submitted on Monday,

* February 5, to the sixteen-member group by the, ex-

ecutive committee of FPC, appointed -by Miss Wilson
andcomposed of Gertrude Broido, C40, Alpha Epsilon
Phi; Kathryn Stultz, Ed40, Delta Zeta, and Miss Wil-
son, an ex-oﬁicio member. ‘

After prolonged discussion the sixteen sorority pres-
idents unanimously agreed to submit the proposal to
the individual houses Monday night. It was further
agreed that only upon a two-thirds approval by the
member houses should the measure receive campus-
wide publicity. ' ' S

No official statement could be obtainedthis week as
to what course friends of the no-politics pledge will
take to extend its force to the “unregimented four”
sororities which still refuse to participate in the clean-
up. They are Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gam-
ma, Phi Sigma Sigma, and Theta Phi Alpha.

not that
it matters

By Gertrude Lieblich

“Downright demoralizing” we
call the polite little game which is
played in the Tuck Shop every day
between. 12:30 and 1:30. When you
win, you call it the game of
“Taken.” When you lose, you call
it a lot of other things.

“Taken” is played in this man-
ner: You ﬁght your way into the
Student Soup-kitchen and rush up
to a vacant seat. Just before you

get there, some fraternity woman
reaches across the table, slaps a
notebook down on the seat, and
screams, “Taken.” That’s strike
one on you.

With all the “ﬁght, Pittsburgh,
ﬁght” spirit, you can muster, you
spy another vacant seat. It is lo-
cated, of course, at the other end of
the Mess Hall. By the time you get
there, an English major sings out,
“Sorree. It’s taken.” Strike two.
.Finally, you see a seat which has
nothing on it. But your optimism
is entirely unwarranted. Some Law
stoogent is holding it by “moral
suasion”——he’s got his feet wrapped
around the rungs.

By this time you decide to eat
your lunch standing. If you work
on the S. R. 0. system, it takes a
full hour to eat an egg sandwich a
la Satan, even when faciliated by
brown cow’s milk.

. And the net result is that some
ﬁfty persons are standing around
eating their lunches while there are

some ﬁftyempty chairs. As the old '

Italian master said, it’s a pretty pic-
ture. Strange, but he titled .it
“Lunch-time at the Zoo.” ‘

Did You Know

. As farascan be determined, the
University of-Pittsburgh is the only
University in. the country whose
administration, rather than student
organization, sponsors a weekly
tea, according to Mrs. J. K. Miller,
hostess in the Commons Room.

Wednesday, February 14, 1940

from the

Sidelines

By Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

Sam Balter, the Inside of Sports man who tells all every set.
urday night on a national radio hookup, spent more than a third of
his ﬁfteen minute program talking about the University’s relay
team, or rather the team that ran away with the Penn Relays

trophies last spring.

(The script for that portion of his program

was authored by Pitt News track specialist Ben Foote.)
Vfliile brother Balter, 52 times a year, ﬁnds something in the

(C

sports ﬁeld that happens

once in a lifetime,” his placing of the

Pitt triumphs in that category is warranted. Four firsts, two of
them new records, in as many starts are not to be ignored.

It was that Friday and Saturday in April, 1939, that Carl
Olson’s boys established themselves as the greatest Penn Relay
squad in the meet’s history. Defending champions by virtue of
their three victories the year before, the Blue and Gold runners en-
tered four of the six important events, repeated their 1938 achieve-
ments and added a win for good measure.

Everybody Does It

Four times Frank Ohl led off and gave the number two man
the baton anda lead on the ﬁeld. Three times Long John Vlloodruff
carried his six—foot-several frame around the track in the vital
anchor position, twice having to come from behind to win,

No matter who made up the foursome, the Panthers ﬁnished

first.

Larry Tregonning, Art Thomas, Al Ferrara, Clyde Graf—-

two of them were always out there with iron man Ohlrand tireless
Johnny, reducing the Penn Relays’ team standing to a scramble for

second place.

It was a great performance, particularly since it was made in
competition. with such ﬁne teams as Fordham, NYU, and Cornell.
Against such opposition the Pitt men had to be good.

To prove that it had been no ﬂuke, the quartet of Ohl, Ferrara,
Graf, and ‘Woodruff later in the year nearly took the mile relay
event in the National Collegiate championships. Only a bad break

prevented them from winning.

‘Too Much for Johnny

Ohl opened and gave Pitt a lead at the quarter. Wlien Ferrara

‘passed the baton to Graf, it was still a close race.

Clyde was out

in front when Southern California ’s Upton fell, tripping the NYU
‘man ahead of him, who in turn knocked down Graf. Upton was up
again immediately but by the time the startled Graf regained his
feet and completed the lap, the gap between the Southern Cal
anchor man and VVoodruff was too great for even Johnny to close.

It is unlikely that Pitt will ever again have a relay combina-
tion so deadly as that 1939 sextet, for one man, Woodruff, made the
difference between a good team a.nd a great team, Saturday night

at the Boston A. C. games, that point was at least partially proved. .
. The Pitt team of Ferrara, Stickel, McKee, and Oh] entered the 
mile relay against Manhattan and Princeton.

With the race thrice

«quarters over, the Panthers were a close second but Ohl, running in
the unfamiliar number four slot, allowed Burrowes of Princeton to
pass him. He couldn’t catch up again.

This is no condemnation of Ohl, a. brilliant lead-off man, nor of
the present team, but with Long John at anchor, the presence of
Princeton and Manhattan in the race would have been a pure

formality.

Dr. Carlson Stresses Values

Of Radio in Health Education

In an eﬁort to prove the beneﬁts
of social and mental development as
well as physical in a program for
better health education, Dr. H. C.
Carlson, director of the Student

‘Health a Service, explains that the
“reasons for the gloriﬁcation of ath-

letics is that they add to community
pride v and _-make for individual

I egotism.”

Speaking‘ before the Western
Pennsyl,va»nia. branch of the Na-
tional i.Health»,- Physical Education
and Iiecreational Directors’ society
in theffauditorium of Frick school,

the radio in bringing to the public
the truth and “bunk” of health ad-
vertisements.

“The radio is now uniﬁed in its
teaching of sound health education,
but it is the responsibility of people
in health work to put the require-
ments. within reach of the greatest
number of people,” declared Dr.
Carlson, who also coaches the Uni-
versity basketball squad. 1,

Dr. Carlson believes that cleanli-
ness, good air, posture and heat are
alldire necessities of life and said,
“upon our aggregate, health, phy-
sical, mental and social rests the
rise or fall of our existence.”

Seeking their seventh victory

battle scheduled for the Pitt
stadium pavilion tomorrow night.

Although a Panther-Covenanter

vide action enough for local fans,
an added attraction pits two basket-
ball-bred brothers, John and Sam
Milanovich, against each other.

Neither squad’s record measures
up to its usual standard, but each
has more potential passing and
shooting ability than statistics in-
dicate. The Geneva team has been
troublesome to all opposition, but
for some unknown reason wilted
before the hapless Carnegie Tech
dribblers in both their games.

AE&ME Team
Stays Unbeaten

By topping the lndustrials, 36-
25, on Monday, the AE&lVlE ﬁve,re-
mained unbeaten and on top of the
Engineering league basketball
standings. I

The triumph stretched the vic-
tors’. win streak to four games.
Dunbar continued his top ﬂight
play by contributing 15 points to
hold high man honors again. Ten

points by Industrial’s Crane sec-
onded the scoring race.

The best game of the Friday card
found the under-rated College
I-licks upsetting the basketball dope
and turning in an impressive win
over the’ defending champs, the
Newmans, by a 16-15 score.

- ‘Phil Lynch paced the losers by

rolling up nine points, while Mc-
Farlin scored an equal number for
the College Hicks. Both teams re-
sorted to a close checking defense,
thus accounting for the low score.
In the other elimination fray the
Jerks took the Pitt club into camp,
18-17, also checking close and re-

_ fusing to, give their opponents any

time to shoot.

In volleyball the Delta Tau Delta
spikers defeated the Phi Epsilon

over the Kappa Sigs 3-0 and the
Phi Delta Theta topped the Sigma

Phi Kaps, Theta Chis, Phi Gams
Lead Fraternity Cage Scramble

By Alex Zelenski

Tonight’s basketball schedule will
show thrills-a-plenty with the red
hot I-F race in its ﬁnal stages.

Phi Kappa, Theta Chi, and the
Phi Gams are the present pace set-
ters and must secure wins to keep
them in their high position.

Theta Chi, led by “Wild Bill”
Fitchko, and “Special Delivery”
Jones, meet the toughest foe as the
Lambda Chi quintet has shown on
several occasions enough ability to
spring an upset. The Phi Kaps also
meet a large obstacle in the PiKA
basketeers, led by the high scoring
Bill Barrett.

The Fijis should have a compara-
ticely easy time in recording a vic-
tory over the Phi Ep ﬂoormen. A
high scoring duel is expected as
Bill Edmunds of the Phi Gams and
Morty Reifer, high scoring for,-
ward of the Phi Eps, have similar
ideas.

‘Another thrilling encounter will
be staged as the Delts meet the Phi
Delts. Emil Narick and Harris
Hawkins are the veterans and main
t'm.‘eats of the Delt team.

Tomorrow afternoon, volleyball
takes the main spotlight as Pitt’s
playing host to the Geneva quintet
lightens the intramural schedule.

Undefeated Delta Tau Delta and
Phi Gams are leading the league as
volleyball competition d1"aWS t0 3
close. Kappa Sigma and the Phi
Delts are runncrs—up.

Freshman League

Schedule Changed

Because of a conflict with varsity
basketball practice, the two contests
scheduled yesterday in the fresh-
man Polar league have been post-
poned until today.

The Snowﬂakes meet the Seals
at 3:30 this afternoon at the Stadi-
um, and the Polar Bears tip oﬁ
against the Defrosters in the 4:30
second game.

Another schedule change has the
Polar Bears opposing the Seals and
the Snowﬂakes clashing with the
Defrosters on February 20 instead
of February 21, as originally sched-
uled. I , 1

 

This undefeated Delt team is led
by “Bing” Benghouser and Emil
Narick. They will meet the SAE
team tomorrow afternoon.

Standings in the engineering
league have the Oil and Gas, AE &
ME ﬂoormen still undefeated and
leading the league by a large mar-
gin. The independent league,
which is divided into two parts,
have the Jerks in section one as the
only undefeated team.

The Jerks are in ﬁrst place with
ﬁve victories and the Pitt Club close
behind with six victories and one
defeat. Section two shows the
twice defeated Upper Dents in ﬁrst
place and the Physical Education
team close behind.

Men’s Debating Association, held
the same position last year.

Appointment was made by Miss
Genevieve Blatt, ’33, former in-
structor in political sci-ence and now
chief examiner of the City of Pitts-
burgh civil service commission,
who is also executive director of
the conference. Duties of the posi-
tion, according to Miss Blatt, place
Aldisert in charge of promotion
work for the conference which
meets in the state capitol buildings
at Harrisburg April 18-21.

This year’s University delegation
to the conference will be under
the supervision of Bernard Mc-
Kenna, ’39, graduate assistant in
political science, who announced
today that meeting of last year’s
delegation will take place today
at 2:30 o’clock in 149 Cathedral.

Plans for the organization of this
year’s delegation to the conference
will be discussed at Wednesday’s
meeting, McKenna said. “We urge
everyone who made the Harrisburg
trip last spring to attend inasmuch
as we are going to formulate rules
for the admittance of new mem-
bers to the University unit,” he
stated.

Students Produce
Correct Answers

To Hard Equation

“Equations” oftentimes cause a
lot of trouble for certain under-
graduates and others in universities
throughout the country, but a par-
ticularly diﬁicult one resulted in an
award of $5 to R. E. Friedrich, E40.

John A. Dent, head of the
mechanical engineering department,
recently posted what appeared to
be a compiex equation, and offered
five “iron men” to any student who
could solve it.

So the boys scratched their heads
awhile and then began scratching
graphs on papers in order to incur
the pleasure of Mr. Dent, notwith-
standing the lure of the “greenies.”

When it was all over Mr. Dent
was surprised because six persons
handed in correct solutions to the
equation and one of them was a
freshman. But the class was also
surprised because the answer made
up the word, “PITT.”

Consolation prizes were given to
James Bateman, E41, and Harold
E. Ebersole, E40. These prizes were
copies of “Recreations in Mathe-
matics” by H. E. Licks.

Gregory Lauds University Fine
Arts Gallery, Ceramics Studio

By Anita Barone

“A little ceramic heaven” is the
way the thirtieth ﬂoor of the Ca-
thedral was described this week by
W aylande Gregory, America’s fore-
most ceramic sculptor, who 13st
Monday evening lectured in the ﬁne
arts gallery as a highlight of the
American Ceramic Society Con-
vention being held here.

Praising the University ﬁne arts
department very highly, Mr,
Gregory said that the ceramic stu-
dio is one of the most complete lab-
oratories he has ever visited in
American colleges.

“University students should feel
as proud of the ﬁne arts gallery as
they are of, say, the football team”
he said. ’

Ceramics, he believes, is the best
medium we have for permanent
color. For this reason, he says, the
ceramic art will in time become a
very important course in American
schools.

“Ceramics combines the qualities
of painting and sculpture and they
unite in a very popular form. It
has a new dimension in the art
ﬁeld, and has a tremendous future,
and it is up to the young to de-
velop it,” he said.

Mr. Gregory has done extensive
portrait work in Hollywood, in-
cluding as his subjects, Delores Del
Rio, Gilda Grey, and Henry Fonda.

Rushing

ties where the rushees can relax
while they bowl, play ping-pong, or
have a good bull session, one house
is planning a dance and another a
swimming party at Trees Gym.

Entertainment for Friday evening.
is more varied. One of the novel
parties will be a “variety night”
which will show the rushees the
different aspects of fraternity life.

Another house will have a “you-
name-it night” where the rushees:
may decide what they want to do.
A novelty dance being given by one
group of lads sounds interesting
since the rushing chairman has re-
fused to give out any information
about it.

Rushing rules stipulate that each
fraternity must hold its last event
in the chapter quarters, so Satur-
day night all the groups are giving
dances—everything from hillbilly
hops to dinner dances.

No matter what kind of parties
each fraternity gives the idea is the
same. “We’re going to let down
our hair and help the rushees do
the same,” said one fraternity
spokesman.
