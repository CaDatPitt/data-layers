It's Gotta Be Clean

To Please the -Dean

Panthefpublicity has its ups
and downs.

Last Wednesday orders came
from oﬂicial sources who sel-
dom care to be quoted that
signs reading, “VLADIMEER

to PANTHER MAGAZINE be-
cause it is SEXIER,” were ob-

.: jectionably suggestive.

The signs came down.

Last Friday the placardswere

Congress-News Investigation

Throws Light On Food Prices  

By Frank

Langsdale

After a long and slightly fruitful inquiry, Student congress and
the Pitt News have uncovered a ﬁnal explanation for Tuck Shop prices
and policy; In an interview Friday afternoon, Mr. John‘ Weber, Sec-
retary of the University, explained the system under which the food

services operate.

When the cafeteria and Tuck Shops were opened, they were a

risk and an experiment.

Primarily as a convenience to the student

body, they have passed the test¢

and are now on a paying basis.
Less than one per cent of the total
receipts are used for replacing
equipment, improving
service, and remodeling. The re-
mainder is swallowed inwages,
and overhead.

Mr. Weber stated that this slim
margin of proﬁt was necessary,
for the University could not use
state funds nor student tuition
fees to keep the food services in
operation. '

The Secretary also claimed nu-

Nmefous improvements in the Tuck

Shops. that will eventually beneﬁt

the it t‘ d t He expressed_ a ﬁrzn _

belief that the cafeteria will be
remodeled and rank with Pitts-
burgh’s best.

“The University,” remarked Mr.
Weber, “is not in the food busi-
ness to make money, and if the
food services were consistently
unproﬁtable we should probably
have to raise prices or close down.
Why should money be taken from
state funds that may come in part
from an Oakland restauranteur?
Or, why should a student who
does not patronize the food serv-
ices " be indirectly forced to con-
tribute to their support?,” Mr.
Weber queried. I

KDKA Starts

FM Station
Behind Gym

Ground was broken last week
for KDKA’s new 500-foot FM
tower. The FM outlet is being
constructed on a plot behind Trees
gym. _

Topped by a 30-foot antenna, the
tower is designed to serve an area
covering 8400 square miles and
containing a population of 2,100.-
000. «

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
joined Lee Curran, station mana-
ger of KDKA, in the dedica-
tion ceremonies marking the be-
ginning of the construction work.

Frequency modulation with its
lack of commercials and clearer
ﬁdelity, began in 1942 when
KDKA installed a transmitter at
Allison Park. In 1945, KDKA
moved to the present site; in 1946
broadcasting continued with a
temporary antenna in use.

KDKA-FM is now operating on
two frequencies, 47.5 and 92.9
Programs are broad-
cast daily and Sunday from 3 p.
m.,unti1 10 p. in. under the direc-
tion of Miss Patty Littell. All_ of
the entertainment is musical and

transcribed with the exception of

two newscasts a week.

Radio Youth, members of the
Junior Achievement group in
Pittsburgh are given time on FM.
These students write, direct, and
produce shows every second and

ed for the erection of the Veter- U

ans administration hospital atop L

the hill.
Ending a ﬁve-day rumor that

travelled through Pittsburgh as 
— well as the University, the Chan-

cellor, during the interview, clari-
ﬁed certain parts of the rumor
and dispelled others. ’.

Commenting on the report that
W. L. Mellon" would soon present
to the University the old town
hall site (Ruskin ﬁeld), Dr. Fitz-
gerald said that he knows noth-
ing about the proposed gift.

He did, however, say that sev-
eral lalternate plans dealing with
replacement of the science build-
ings and gymnasium on top of the
bill are under consideration.

iMany Plans Take Shape .” .
Among these are plans: to erect

a ﬁeld house beyond Schenley‘ V,
plaza on “Bubbles” ﬁeld; to build, . '
laboratories and class rooms along . .

Fifth avenue, parallel to ODK

walk; to construct at a yet un- » A

disclosed point the necessary.
foundation for the government-
donated hangar—type building to
be used as a ﬁeld house. All of
these are in the embryo stage
and will be studied by the build-
ing committee

There are also numerous other " it
\ plan-s before the Board to make

up for the loss of the buildings on
the hill.
Board Forms Committee
After the board met, the Chan-

cellor issued the following state-,‘ 

merit in the name of the Board of
Trustees:
tees of the University of Pitts-
burgh at its meeting this after-
noon reviewed the problem of
planning new buildings to take

the place ‘of those which must. 9

be vacated for the erection of the
Veterans administration hospital
on top of University hill. As a re-
sult, a planning and development
committee‘ was authorized. The
Chancellor will work with this
committee‘ in preparing recom-
mendations to the Board of Trus-
tees.”

To the students, Chancellor
Fitzgerald said, “I want to pro-
vide you with laboratories and a
ﬁeld house as soon as is possible.
I cannot, however, go ahead of
the board in making plans.”

In 1908 the contest bore its ﬁrst
fruit—State hall, School of Mines_

Despite the fact that Clarion’

was turned back by Indiana
teachers, 4-1, and collected only
four hits, the Panthers expect a
tough contest.

Clarion went undefeated in nine
contests last season and hold vic-
tories over California t.eachers,
whom the Pitt swingers also con-
quered, and Slippery Rock this
year.

Coach Ralph Mitter1ing’s men
will be out to avenage a 2-0 de-

Clarion. The Jungle Cats are a
much stronger club this season,

However, mentor Mitterling is
somewhat concerned over the
slump of second. sacker Art
Barnes. Barnes, whose slugging
was the backbone of last year’s
hitting attack, has been able to
muster only two hits in the ﬁrst
four tilts. Fortunately the hitting
difficulties have not affected his

Allegheny Six

Having opened the 1947 season
with a loss to a powerful Army
team at West Point last Saturday
by a 7-2 score, -Coach David
O’Laughlin’s tennis squad meets
another equally strong court ag-
gregation from Allegheny college
tomorrow afternoon.

Allegheny shows two wins in as
many starts with victories over
Duquesne and Wooster last week.
Through 26 seasons, Allegheny
tennis teams have copped 101
wins and show 73 defeats. The ’47
squad which is built around four
returning lettermen, Hileman, the
squad’s captain, Radov, Steinle
and Pollard, are after another un-
defeated year.

Saturday's 7-2 defeat at West
Point will be chalked up as ex-
perience for the Panther court-
men, for the team had only one
day of actual practice. Several
new faces appeared in the lineup
for Pitt. Russ Campbel, John
Clinton, and Ivan Birsic joined the
holdovers from last year to make
the Eastern trip.

BiTrack Meet

While the varlsity prepares for
a meet with Penn State on Satur-
day, the B track team takes on
Slippery Rock at the stadium on
Thursday.

Juniata Breaks‘
Pitt Win Streak

Pitt's three-game winning streak
was snapped by J uniatza Saturday
at College Field, in Hunt’ gdon,
when the Indians thirottled the
Panthers, 8-2. Pitcher lDick Frick
hurled no-hit ball until the sev-
enth inning, but the tanned Jungle
Cats managed to garner two saf-
eties in the remaining three in-

‘ nings.

George Goldberg was the losing
pitcher, being relieved by Bobby
Lucchino in the fouritlh. It was
Goldberg’s ﬁrst performance in a
starting role this season.

J uniata took the lead in the ﬁrst
inning, when Bob Holsinger
singled to drive in two: runs. The
Indians tallied four times in the
fourth on four singles, 31 walk, and
an error. Two more runs came
in the eighth on two ﬁngles and
an outﬁeld error.

John Wascieko stole hiome in the
fourth to give Pitt its ﬁrst tally.
Singles by Wascieko and Bob
Rosfeld, plus a J uniata error gave
Pitt another run in the eighth.

The Panthers were n-ot up to
par accounting for five errors.

,Their hitting attack was stopped

cold, and muchof the pitching was

ineffective. .
