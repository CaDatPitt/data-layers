Xi Psi Phi Suspends ‘for
Want of Members

Xi Psi Phi, national professional
dental fraternity, announced. this
week the voluntary suspension of
its charter at the University.
Lack of membership was given as
the reason for discontinuing the
chapter.

The fraternity was established
at Pitt in 1924 as the Alpha Upsi-
lon chapter. Until this year the
chapter was-able to carry a. mem-
-bership suﬂicient to meet its ﬁnan-
cial oblig tions. ‘However, because»
of a dropfin membership since last
spring a d -in order not to incur
heavy indebtedness, the members
recently decided to give up their
“charter, said J. P. Lay., Dent. '32,
president of the group.

During its seven years on the
campus, Xi Psi has had three
houses. Last May the fraternity
moved to the corner of Ward. and
Semple street. ,

Xi Psi Phi is the second,frater-
nity to give-‘up its charter since
the opening of school this fall.
Theta Kappa. Nu, 1 national social
fraternity, disbanded three weeks
ago. *

vWith the elimination of X1 Psi
Phi, there remain only three den-
tal fraternities on the campus.
These are Psi Omega, Delta Sigma

Lin that Notre Dame has ﬁve run
fteams upon which it can call for
action.

 Ossie Solem, who saw both ‘Pitt
and Notre Dame in action, predicts
that Pitt will be beaten by from
three to ﬁve touchdowns; and con-
sidering his qualiﬁcations, there
seems to be little" hope for a_ Pitt
._victory~. ’

‘ We're going to, use everything
we have and ﬁght to ‘the best of
our.ability. The team’s mora1_e.will
puffer greatly if we lose and will
have to be built up again from the
bottom. Notre Dame, however, is
(lathe logical favorite. _

That not all_members of Inter-
fraternity Council on the campus
are in favor of cutting the number
of rushing" events to two for the
coming season is revealed by a
survey which was conducted by the
‘Pitt Weekly. Some of the fraterni-
ties feel that at least three events
are necessary for their members to
become adequately acquainted with
the rushees.

The Interfraternity Council de-
cided at its last meeting to change
the number of events from four to
two. The council, can still change
the number of events if the tra-
ternities feel they need more,

“I feel that three events would
probablybe better because it would
enable the fraternities to learn to
know the rushees better and make
a better choice of their prospective
pledges,” says -Theodore W. Biddle,
faculty adviser of the council.

W. Eugene Pry, president of Phi
-Gamma Delta, in speaking about
his fraternity’s protest against the
decision says, “The rushing period
extends over two week-ends and
only two events in all this time will
not stimulate the rushees’ desire
to join any fraternity. Then, too,
two events are not enough for a
fraternity to become sufficiently ac-
quainted with the rushees in mak-
ing the best choice of their pros-
pective pledges.

Miss Atnos Entertains

Miss Thrysa W. Amos, dean of
women, entertained members of
Mortar Board honorary senior ac-
tivities fraternity for women, at
dinner Wednesday evening, Octo-

At a business meeting of the or-
ganization on Wednesday, October

chapter as submitted by Mildred
Levinson, 001., the chairman of the
by-laws committee. and Gladys
Schmidt, Col., were accepted. The
service program was outlined, but
no definite dates were announced.

Anne Kovach, Ed, chairman of

that there would be at least four
major ,.events on the program for
the year. The first event planned
upon is the party to be held for the
women of professional schools.
There will also be a get-together for

more practice than we have. They
started the last two, weeks in Au-
gust, we started _September 15.
Their offense is much farther along
than ours, although we clicked all
right against Dnake last week.

Pitt's veteran line is greater
than that used by Northwestern to
hold Notre Dame to a scoreless tie
in the mud of Soldiers Field. Mac-
Murdo and Quatse can match
Northwestern’s tackles, and the
rest of the Pitt line, especially the
ends, is stronger.

I have been at a loss all week as
to howsto stop the Pitt attack.
The Panthers have used but one
formation this year and have em-
ployed but four plays. We do not

know. what to expect from their

double wing back formation.

“The money which will be spent
in taking the rushees to the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel and other outside
institutions could be better utilized
in events on the campus. It is the
fraternity’s private business as to
how many rushing events should be
held.”

Three fraternity presidents who
back, W. Eugene Pry to the limit
are: Allyn Cortice_ Theta Delta
Pi; George Harrington, Sigma Chi
and members -of the fraternity com-
mittee; and Paul Friedman, Sigma
Alpha Mu. ’

1 Daniel J. Butler, president of Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon, is in favor of
having only two events and says,
“The University has cut their ap-
propriations to all campus activi-
ties and I feel that fraternities
should follow with, a cut in their
expenses. It will cut the rushing
-assessment for some of the fra-
ternity members considerably.
Luncheon meetings will make bet-
ter opportunities for cfraternity
members to meet the rushees.”

The fraternity presidents up-
holding Daniel Butler in his state-
ment are: Howard Henn. Phi Del-
ta Theta; Robert Kiser, Kappa Sig-
ma; Allen Vatz, Phi Epsilon Pi;
John Stirling, Delta Tau Delta, and
Harold Cronin, Phi Kappa.

Interfraternity Council will meet

the issue at that time;

2 Delegates

Branstone Draws Up
Rules For Bid Day

Mildred.Levenson, Col. '32, presi-
dent of Panhellenic and Mary Gar-
ber, Ed. ’33, treasurer, have been
elected as delegates to the Na-
tional Panhellenic Council Confer-
ence at St. Louis October .29, 30
and 31. Miss Levenson is a mem-
ber of Alpha Epsilon Phi frater-
nity and Miss Garber of Delta Zeta.

This is the first year that N. P.
C. which is composed of the alum-
nae organizations of national fra-
ternities, has issued invitations to
undergraduates. The purpose of
this is to establish a closer rela-
tionship between the organization
that controls fraternities and the
college chapters. The undergradu-
ate delegates will be permitted to
speak and offer suggestions in the
open forum meetings. of the con-
vention but they will have no vote.

The rules which will govern bid

‘ day.,have been announced by Mary

Jane Brankstone, Education, 32,
chairman of rushing rules. They
are as follows:

1. Tuesday, November 10,
shall be bid day.

‘ _ II. All bidding shall be done
by the preferential ballot.

III. Eligibility lists will be
in the omce of the dean J of
women November 6 to 9 inclu-
sive. ‘Any girl may be bid
who is on this list.

IV. Silence period shall ex-
tend from November 9' at mid- .
night until November 13 at
noon.

V. One girl fiom each fra-
ternity 'may call on Friday.
November 13 at 9 o’clock in the
evening for the bid list.

The system of preferential bid-
ding which has. always been used
in the spring rushing season has
been adopted with bid day -because
it will eliminate the confusion that
results from having a period of
open bidding.’ Sometime before
the bid day a meeting will be held
for eligible girls, at which the de-
tails of the system will be ex-
plained to them.

Football Number Features Collegiate Romance,
Sports and Forensics

 

From its lair in Activities Building, last week, the Pitt

Panther once again hatched forth another of its numbers.

This

latest brain-child of the Howard-Weslagerians species, when in
its formative stages, raised such a kick that it was christened the

football number.

. Turned loose on the campus a week ago, it received gen-

eral adoption by the student body.
Patricia Pitt, “and what ‘biting’¢

‘ ‘ How ‘ ki-ute’ 1’ ’ thought

humor." Campus reception of the
issue was evidenced by the Panther
boys resuming their regular meals
this week. “Kick in and buy the
football number,” said “Hi” How-
ard, chairman, in an exclusive in-
terview.
A salient spot in this very punny
issue is a "high-powered college
story with a football theme en-
titled "Pinkey, the Second.” It
was written by Kenneth Morrow,
evidently a pen name for one of our
own boys.
Cohen Writes ‘Sports.
Morris Cohen, sports editor of the
‘Weekly, contributed an enlighten-
ing article on football in which he
discusses the condition at Western
_.Reserve. He also writes of the ab-
surdity in choosing All-American
football teams, pointing out the
many complications involved.

by 3 ; Eddie Hirshberg, Pitt football

captain. presents a humorous edi-
tion of his “Catching Everything,"
demonstrating a versatility in writ-
ing as well as on gridiron. The
Panther prints its , “Football

g Glossary," in which it undertakes
to elucidate humorously on some

the terms peculiar to the game.

’_ 'Nemo Mack, a, promising writer on

‘theeditorial staff of the magazine,
writes a highly diverting and ironic
account of college football which
hechooses to call, “Treatise on the
Football Player." Jokes and illus-
trationsicarry through the football
motif. ' ’ .
 Richard Murphy, coach of men’s
debating, in his article entitled

‘He demonstrates that
“though, the gold standard is tot-
tering, the -silver-tongue standard

The football issue inaugurates
“Our Erie Letter." by Edith Under-
wood of the Erie Center of the Uni-
versity, a Pitt-Erie column.
-“Clothes Quarters,” the fashion
page, features Amy Long and
‘Charles Goldstein, style dictators
of the campus. Goldstein argues
the view that the Empress Eugenie
lists will have their inﬂuence on
men’s styles.

In Campaign

Five Hundred Men Are
Expected To J oin

 

 

The Y. M. C. A. Service Enlist-
ment campaign ends tonight after
a week of personal solicitation by
ﬁfty Y. M. C. A. workers and their
captains. A deﬁnite increase in the
number of men desiring work with
boys’ clubs at settlement houses
has been reported during the four
days of the campaign.

Onb thousand one hundred pam-
phlets were mailed to Pitt stu-
dents in a big mall canvass of the
campus last Monday, and ﬁve hun-
dred men are expected to have en-
listed for one form of service or
another by ﬁve o’clock this even-
ing. A large percentage have en-
listed according to reports early

this week; more are expected to be

received at the “Y” oﬁice during
the early part of next week.

Richard Torgersen, Col. ’33,
chairman of Boys’ Work, has been
particularly successful in receiving
the support of a. large number to
lead boys’ clubs. The increase in
this work is the largest in the his-
tory of the Pitt “Y”.

Interest in Freshman Clubs has
been given a great impetus by the
campaign. John I-Iolbrook, Eng.
’33, Chairman of Freshman Clubs,
reported that the three clubs now
in session are over-crowded and
unless other arrangements can be
made, no additional members will
be accepted for this work. How-
ever, freshmen enrolled for this
service are invited to work with
the “Y” in the numerous Fresh-
man dances which are held during
the noon hour in the Heinz House.

The campaign, although formal-
ly closing this evening, will con-
tinue throughout the year, accord-
ing to John D. Paulus, General
Chairman of the Enlistment. Men
desiring to enter into a Y. M. C. A.
activity will apply at the “Y” oﬂice.
Effort to place as many men as
possible will be the function of an

Enlistment Committee under Paul-.

US.

The organization of captains and
workers used during this campaign
will be available for the Welfare
Fund drive campaign which starts
on the Campus on November 9th.
Practically the same team organi-
zation will go into action at that
time according to the Chairman
and Secretary of the “Y.” ’

An appreciable increase in the
membership of the “Y” has been
noted during the current campaign.
The abolishment of the member-
ship fee has urged many students
to become members.

German Club to Hold .
Election of Officers

Meeting of the German Club will
be held this afternoon at 1 o’clock
in 110 Alumni» Genevieve Mervis,
Col. ’32, president of the club has
been compelled to resign,‘because
of excessive activity credits. Since
the office of treasurer is still va-
cant, election of officers for these
two vacancies will take place to-
day.

Cortissoz Speaker at
International Monday

 

The second of a. series of lec-
tures on the International Art Ex-
hibit in Carnegie Institute will be
given next Monday night at 8:15

A.A. Marchbin Outlines
Gypsy History to Club

 

Andrew A. Marchbin. graduate
student, was the chief speaker at
the meeting of the International
Women's League last night in the
International Institute. His topic,
“History of the Gypsies,” was well
developed by a general outline of
gypsy immigration into Europe,
sketches of their life and customs,
and their social position in Europe
and America. ’

He added to this some advice
as to what can and should be done
concerning these people, as well as
translations of of German, Hun-
garian, Roumanian, and Slovakian
gypsy poetry. Mr. Marchbin is re-
sponsible for the translation of
these poems into German, while
Dr. Hatﬁeld, of the History depart-
ment, put them into English.

Five years research in Europe
and study at the University of
Zurich in Switzerland has given
Mr. Marchbin, excellent material
on this subect. At present, he is
working for a Ph.D. degree, the
thesis for which will be “History
of the Gypsies.”

To Take Peace to Heart

 

“Hybrid peace is today's peace.
War is an oﬁense of the human
conscience,” said Canon T. Guy
Rogers, Chaplain to the King of
Englaxili and Canon of Birming-
ham, at a meeting in the Heinz
House last Monday evening. Rev.
H. T. Clarke, assistant pastor of
,the Calvary Episcopal Church, in-
troduced the speaker.

“There are three kinds of peace,
sham peace, which we had before
the war; armed peace, such as
we’ve had in so many times, past;
and hybrid peace, the kind of
peace of fear and exhaustion we
have today,” said the Canon.
“Peace is of bad taste in the
mouths of many people today be-
cause it has a negative character.
We must ﬁll peace with meaning.
I am grateful for the sympathetic

intelligence of the American peo-
e N

When, interviewed before the ad-
dress Canon Rogers commented
on college students, saying “There
are a great many of you young-
sters who think war is a glorious.
romance. You don't like the word
peace, it suggests a soporiﬁc indif-
ference to you. Modern youth buys
its experience—-—and buys it’dear-
13*.
“College youth today has a dis-
like for the rhetoric on the sub-
ject. What was right or wrong for
one generation does not necessar-
ily mean that it should be right or
wrong for the generation which fol-
lows. You young people of today
ﬁnd yourselves in a unique position
for leadership. I wonder how
you’re going to handle it? Certain-
1y I can’t predict anything.”

The industry that succeeds today is the
one that looks outside its own "back—yard
for ways to make itself more valuable.

For many years, Bell System men
have been working out ideas to increase
the use and usefulness of the telephone.
For example, they prepared plans for
selling by telephone which helped an
insurance man to increase his annual

business from $1,000,000 to ‘$5,500,000
——a wholesale grocer to enlarge his vol-
ume 25% at a big saving in overhead-—
a soap Salesman to sell $6000 worth of
goods in one afternoon at a selling cost
of less than 1%!

This spirit of cooperation is one rea-

Bell System enjoys so im-

portant a place in American business.

Needs Are Discussed By
Retail Men

Paul’ N. Nystrom. professor in

the School of Business at Colum-
bia University was the principal
speaker at the banquet last night
in the Cardinal room of Hotel Wil-
liam Penn which closed the ses-
sions of the annual-conference of

the Research Bureau for Retail
Training. Other speakers were
Dr. David R. Craig, director of the
bureau; P. J. Reilly, head of the
Associated Merchandising and Re-
tail Research Association of New
York, who acted as toastmaster;
A. H. Burchﬂeld, of the Joseph
Home Company, and Paul Hollis-
ter, newspaper advertising author-

y.

At the three day conference rep-
resentatives of local. and out-of-
town department stores discussed
what is being done to increase
efficiency and aid the buyer. An
attempt has been made during the
conference to analyze the needs
of department store management,
control and training. Bishop
Brown, Gordon Grant, Natalie
Kneeland, Louis Fairchildal and
Arthur C. Kaufmann spoke on
changes to be made in training, re-
tailing, hiring, managing and pub-
licity.

One of the features of the con-
ference was a practical interview
between a prospective department
manager and the management, with
four local department store execu-
tives participating. , Louis Fair-
child, news editor of Fairchild pub-
lications, declared that advertising
should equal news in interest
value. ’

Representatives of twenty-three
member stores took part in the
conference, nine of which were
from Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh
stores are: Boggs and Buhl,

Frank and Seder, Glmbel Brothers, v

Joseph Horne, Kaufmann’s, Lewin-
Neiman, Meyer Jonasson, and Ro-
senbaum’s.

Seventy -"Four Coeds
To Pitt Classes

Stanford. Cornell, Duke, Rol-
lins, and Missouri State were
represented among the seventy-
four women who attended
Dean Amos‘ dinner for transfer
students last week. .

They come from all parts of
the country. Quite a‘ number
of them have ridden alligators
in the far south, and just as
large a number claim to have
lassoed «bulls in the west--a.
ﬁtting preparation for college
life.

There are two Freshman
transfers from Ohio University
and Oberlin Training School
who have just escaped the
clutches of the Custom Com-
mittee by one semester. How-
ever, they do attend Mentor
meetings along with the twen-
ty-none Sophomores, twenty-
three Juniors, and the twenty
Senio°r transfers.

Pitt's Junior College branch-
es at Johnstown, Erie and
Uniontown, Pa., have sent us
nineteen students. According
to one of the women the only
difference between the junior
and sen-ior colleges is the High-
er Education with the accent
on Trees’ Gym and the Mines
and Minerology lab they re-
ceive here.

Fourteen . women decided to
leave the normal schools, and
to see the world at Pit.

One of them when asked
what she thought of the orien-
tation course _she was receiv-
ing, replied vaguely——oh. oh, -
yes, the Chinese problem was
interesting, wasn’t it?

lM’ia.rk Shields will Be
Journalistic Tea. Guest

Mark Shields. political editor of
the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, will
speak to Pitt students next Monday
afternoon at 3:00 at Heinz House.
Xylon, women's honorary Journal-
istic fraternity, is sponsoring the
address, and the tea which will
follow.

The speaker is well-known in lo-
cal newspaper circles, having been
associated for the past eight years
with downtown papers. He has
the reputation of a better acquaint-
ance with the political situation
of both Pittsburgh and Western
Pennsylvania than any other local
newspaper man.

While at present a political
writer, Mr. Shields has been cop-
nected with all phases of newspa-

. per work, and has held executive

positions on both the Toledo News-
Bee and the Washington Morning
Herald.

An invitation to this affair, which
will be in the form of a tea, has
been extended by the fraternity to
any man or woman on campus in-
terested in hearing Mr. Shields.

Helen Helck, Bus. Ad. ’32,.is in
charge of the afternoon's program,
and Alice Davis, Col. '33. heads
the social committee. '

Coed Interfrafernity
*5 Tournanient Planned

The ﬂrst attempt at interfrater-
nity athletic competition for wom-
en at the University of Pittsburgh
will be ‘held in the form of a
bounce ball tournament. Bounce
ball has been chosen because the
rules of the game are simple, and
the game is merely a modiﬁed form
of volley ball with the net lowered.
No previous practice is necessary,
and only a change of shoes is re-
quired. Seven players make up a
team.

The tournament will begin next
week, and the games will be played
every Monday afternoon from four
thirty until ﬁve thirty. No entrance
fee is required of the fraternities
participating, and a trophy will be
awarded the winner of the tourna-
ment.

Fraternities are asked to ar-

range their line-ups and to regis-
ter at Trees Gym by Monday. '

, Dr. Benjamin B. Williams, pro-
fessor of political science, dis-
cusses the relationship between
disarmament and the welfare of

the United States in his new book, '. terest discussed in the book are
“The United States and Disarma-  the needs of American national de-

ment,” which came off the Whit-:
tlesey House press three weeksl
ago. ’

Dr. Williams surveys the prob-I
lem from all angles, keeping in,
mind at all times the interests of,
the United States.

Evading that false utopianism
that permeates much. of today’s
discussion of the disarmament,
question, Dr. Williams focuses his;
efforts upon a presentation'of all{
phases of the problem as theyl
concern this country.

Dr. Williams analyzes the sea
power theory of history, traces the!
progress of disarmament measures’

through pre- and post-war periods,‘

and summarizes the issues which
confront the world-wide eﬁorts to-
ward disarmament.

Speciﬁc matters of current in-

fense; the post-war naval confer-
ence at Washington, Geneva, and
London; the disarmament pro-
visions of the League of Nations
Covenant; and the operation of
the League machinery.

"The United States and Disarm-
ament” is Dr. Williams’ second
important contribution to the ﬁeld
of international politics and eco-
nomics. His ﬁrst, “Economic For-
eign Policy of the United States,"
published by McGi'aw.Hi11 in 1929,
analyzes the forces making for
peace and the counter-forces mak-
ing for war in international af-
fairs.

Meet On Even
Terms Since, 1909

The athletic competition . be-
tween Pitt and Notre Dame, al-
though one-sided in certain spots,
has been conducted as a whole
upon even terms. Whale Notre
Dame has outclassed ,::Pitt thus far
in football, the Panthers have,
shown their superiority in basket-5
ball, with_the few contests in other
sports having been divided.

The two schools ﬂrst met back
in 1909 when the Notre‘ Dame
eleven eked out a. 6-0 victory over
the Panthers. The two teams
again came’ together in 1911, and
a ‘young end named Knute Rockne
helped the South Bend eleven hold
a strong Pitt team to a 0-0 tie.’
Again, in 1912. the schools met,"
Notre Dame winning, 3-0.

_ There was then a break of. foot-
ball relations for almost twenty
‘years, or until last year, when
Rockne’s great squad ‘buried Pitt,
36-19 while 75,000 fans looked on,
amazed at the power and speedbf
the Ramblers. A ’

Pitt Caalers ‘Win

During the period ofﬁlinaction on
the gridiron, the two schools be-
gan relations in basketball, swim-
ming, and tennis. “Doc” Carlson's
smooth working ﬁves have carved
out a large advantage over Notre
Dame in the ﬂoor sport. The two
schools have met seven times, and
the Panthers have won ﬁve times.
Pitt has taken the last four games
while Notre Dame won the ﬁrst
and third. Every game has been
bitter and close, the Panthers
gaining the last victory by a. mir-.
aculous last,-minute ﬁeld goal by
Timmy Lawry. . . 1

. The Panthers have met Notre
Dame twice in swimming, winning
each time. These meets were held-
in 1927 and 1928, and no contests
have been held since that time.
Notre Dame defeated‘ Pitt in the
only tennis” match held between
the two schools. a

Last~year, the persistent efforts
of Sam Parks to get a representa-
tive golf team which would play
some of the better colleges‘ in the
country were rewarded by, among
other matches, a trip to South

0 lBend. Parks won his match but

to no avail, the Pitt team losing
21,9 to 14%.

The complete records of the
athletic competition between the
two schools is: Pitt won seven,
l\iIotre Dame won seven, and one
t e.

Delay Crowning of
F rat Tennis Champs

Due to the forfeiture of the dis-
puted, match between Phi Kappa’
and Phi Gamma. Delta by the for-
mer team, the champions of the in-
terfraternity tennis tournament
have not yet been determined.

Phi Gamma Delta was supposed
to have played Phi Epsilon Pi,
originally announced as champions,
in a. semi-ﬁnal, match this week,
but the match was postponed pend-
ing sanction ot the executive com-
mittee. The matter is expected to
be settled this week.

Doc Carlson ’s Optimism »



I Engalfs, Cage Co- Captain

“We’ll win them al1.i’,,’, No read-
er, it is not “Doc” Catdson speak-
ing, but rather “Doc”,Kowallis, co-
captain of this year’s basketball
team. A » ,

We found “Doc” wandering
around ‘the Activities building,
talking to everybody who passed.
and generally thinking and dream-
ing basketball. Being curious to

know of the potentialities of this-'

year’s team which faces the tough-
est schedule of any Pitt athletic
team, we asked him what he
thought its chances for ‘success.

“Sure we’l1 win them all,” he re-
assured us after we doubted‘ the
sincerity of his ﬁrst remark, “But-
ler will bertough. They beat us
three years ago when wehad ‘Hyatt
and they'll be just as strong this
year.  ‘ ’

“Purdue? Yes, they’ll be tough,
too. But we ought to take them.
Temple may be hard to boat. We
meet them in the opening" game on
December 10. They might spring
thesamesort of surprise on us this
year that Western Reserve di-d last
year.  ‘

“But I still think that we’ll win
them all. These western teams
may be strong, big, and rangy; -but
we’ll’ have_ more height to our
squad this Yearﬁthan we had last
year than we had last .year.sEither
"Ochsenhirt, Macamant, or Fors-
berg, who played on‘ the Erie Jun-
ior college team
take Willie Arture’s old place at
guard; and ,everyone of these boys
is.‘ taller than Willie.” ~ f

,Doc’s mind wandered from bas-
-ketball somewhat as Joe Orsini,
coach of the Pitt boxing team,
came up to join/theconversation.

“Doe” and Joe ’met in high
school when they were on the Du-

quesne and ,Cla;i'rton high’ football

teams, respectively. “Doc” was a
sophomore then and played quar-
terback. Joe was end on the op-
posing line. L ‘ j

“We tried to run around Joe’s
end twice during the ﬁrst quarter.”
said/Doc, andieach time the ball
carrier was thrown for a ﬁve ard
loss. We put three men on oe,

last year, will

but.we couldn’t take him out of
the play. Alter those two attempts,
I -directed our offense at the other
side of the line.” . ~

Doc gave up football after his
sophomore ‘year due to an injury
to his elbow. He underwent an
operation last year to have the in-
jured member reset and hopes to
have his besfseason of his varsity
career this season. ,

‘He is one of three brothers who
have made names for themselves
in Pitt basketball. George pre-
ceded him and aside lfroms win-
ning a letter three times in the
sport, the elder brother coached
the trbshman team while he attend-
ed Pitt med school. During that
time, the fresh had a string of vic-
tories extending over three sea-
sons and including 51 games.

Steve, or “Tip,” is the other
brother. He entered Pitt at the
same time as “Doc.”
the former has never been a reg-
ular, he has played steady ball
when called upon and is looked up-
on to see moreraction this season
than he has done in the past.-

Rifle Team to Use A
I s New Shooting Style

The varsity riﬂe team has im-
proved considerably since the ﬁrst
call for practice, and the’,scores
are being stepped up each day.

Coach Lieutenant Wilson says
“We are coming along as well as
could be expected. So far, the
work of practically every candi-

date has been satisfactory. We

have adopted a different styleiof

shooting this year called the Navy.
system. The gunner does not use

a sling, but crpsses his left elbow
over his chest to support the gun.
I think this is a much better sys-
temthan the.one we used last
year, and the results we have been
getting bear this out.”

International Art Exhibit Includes Paint, Painting,
0 and Painters But No Real Masterpieces

 

I ' By LEONARD MENDLOWITZ
To be in the social swim, you really MUST visit the Inter-

your friends, your . professors,

national Art Exhibit at Carnegie Institute: There you: will meet

important-looking people, and

practically all others Who compose Mr. and Mrs. Public.

Once in the art galleries, you must appear very impressed.

If you have never taken a course in ﬁne arts, you must still be
familiar with such names as Rembrandt, Da Vinci, Angelo,

must study each picture carefully,
view it critically from every angle,
and from the opposite end of the
room. A

Never must you admit that your
kid brother could draw such hor-

rible looking caricatures as are on .

display here. No, you must gape
in awe and reverence at the paint
splotches, which art critics label
impressionistic artistry. Don't be
plebeian; do comme il faut, and
never display your,‘ really bored
feelings.

Now you approach the prize win-
ning painting. It is called “Suicide
in Costume” and is the masterpiece
of Franklin 0. Watkins. Not that
the title bears any connection to
the puzzle in question. You are ex-
pected to gush forth loud huzzalis
of praise and ecstasy. To get the
proper perspective of the picture,
take ten steps backward, turn a
somersault and
“Suicide in Costume.” You’re a
better man than I am, Gunga Din!

The second prize goes to some
contraption which they would have
you believe is a painting of two
ﬁshermen. You look around to
ﬁnd John Held’s signature,_but no!
it is signed Mario Sironi. Maybe
that’s He1d’s pseudonym!

You walkmlles through scenes of

ment of 67- upperclass women this
year.

Freshman women, while excluded
from membership in the main or-
ganization, will be organized as a
separate unit under the leadership
of upperclass women, trained by
Mrs. Robert D. Ayars. , Women
will enter the Glee Club in their
sophomore year with deﬁnite ‘train-
ing in choral work.

The plans for concerts are some-
what tentative“ inasmuch as the
women will not be suﬂiciently pre-
pared to make an appearance until
they have had a semester of train-
ing, announces Mrs. Ayars. How-
ever plans are being made for a
number of concerts at Crafton,
Wilkinsburg, Carnegie and a num-
ber of other places in the vicinity
some time in early February. The
women also hope to be guests of
Geneva College Glee Club and to
give them a return trip sometime
later in the year.

A change in" Thursday rehearsals
has been made since last year,

For Themes

Panther iWanIts Material
For Literary Issue

 

 

Complying with popular demand
on the part of Pitt students, The
Pitt Panther is oifering as its next
issue a literary number, featuring
student oﬂerings of literary merit
solely.

Sunny Weslager, editor of the
Panther, has. announced a contest
in which all students of the Uni-
versity are eligible. Four prizes of
ﬁve dollars each will be awarded
to the four students who write the
best themes of 250 words. on any
subject, the winning themes to ap-
pear in this issue. Only one mem-
ber of each class can win a prize.
All manuscripts must be turned in
at the Panther Oﬂice, Activities
Building, before November 1, the
magazine going to press soon af-
ter that date. ‘

“The Panther’s forthcoming liter-
ary number will be a purely liter-
ary effort and will contain no
humor at all. It will not be a
humorous version of a literary
magazine. We hope to make this
number the best expression of Pitt
literary ability that has yet been
produced,”
ard, chairman of the Panther.

The literary number will mark
an evident increase in content
over_ past issues of the magazine.

Depression at School

 

HE WOLF of depression is
showing his snarling fangs

even at the cloistered door of

the American college. One re-
sult of his appearance has
ibeen the gradual disappear-
ance of the rah-rah musical
comedy type of campus col-
“ legiate.

;:A new student strides across

’ the campus this year. He has
' shed. his lcoonskin coat -and
‘given up his Fall housepar-
ties and his automobile. The
old-fashioned “parlor date” is
said to be replacing night club
and movies. Dance chairmen
are going sleepless, fraternity

l presidents are considering auc-
tioning off the furniture, coeds
order a phosphate instead of
a sandwich, and books are go-
ing to their fourth or ﬁfth
owner instead of to the well-
earned rest on a library shelf.

College life has taken on a
otally different aspect. It has
been compelled to do this. Stu-
dent income has been les-
sened, but the output re-

, mains the same. Tuition is
anything but lower and board

“ and room, the other large item
on the college bill, has been
decreased very little.

From the standpoint of the
professor, this change in stu-
dent attitude is an improve-
ment. At least it has made

, even the undergraduate think
 of._education, and he seems to
.'f‘* have adjusted himself gravely

V ' but happily to the change.

  

 

“Artiﬁcial Con tes ts ” 11

 

FOOTBALL GAME be-
tween Harvard and the

the Army is an “artiﬁcial con-

1; test" and also “irrational,” in
the opinion of The Crimson,
Harvard student paper. The
two institutions, it says, have
nothing. in common, and it

adds the old complaint that

‘A Army players may have had
7 four years at any college and
than four years more at West

Point.
qshould the “artiﬂcia ” argu-
. ment be logically applied

other games would have to be

abandoned. There is no rival-

ry except athletic, between,

for example, Princeton and

Michigan, Yale and Georgia,

'or Pitt and Notre Dame. On

= the basis laid down by The

Crimson, Harvard would meet

_ teams in close proximity to

 Cambridge, while the Army

would play the Navy and some
military colleges.

. Yet, contrary to this very

argument’ that games should

i -,.be scheduled only with natur-

al rivals, Allegheny College

has recently announced that

 

‘all district teams will be
' dropped from next year's
’ schedule. Over-emphasis on

the games because of the prox-

imity of the student bodies of '

the two institutions was given
as the reason for this policy.

The suggestion of The Crim-
son may be logical enough. . .
but it won't be carried out
rigorously.

IRECTOR OF PUBLIC

, Safety, James M. Clark,

.; ' sitting amid‘ the conﬁnes of

his cartoon-bedecked walls this

week, must have found that

the road ahead looked a whole

lot brighter. Dean Robert C.

Clothier gazing out upon the

steps that lead to Alumni,

must have rejoiced that the

student horde was apparently

not so collegiate as were its
brothers of a. decade ago.

"The reason for all this op-I)

timistic outlook lies in the fact
that pretty nearly the last
vistage of collegianna has van-
ished from the Pitt campus.
At the order of Student Coun-
cil, a. decision made only be-
cause ocf the headache induced
by the episode last Fall, the an-
nual Tech pep parade has been
abandoned. And so fades a
beautiful memory, a yearly
custom that one remembered
for its trolley-pulling, cheering,
and traditional pilgrimage to
one of our better known if less
highly respected amusement
centers.

But last year the parade was
turned into a fiasco by the
over-zealousness of the law,
and a failure on the part of the
Student Chairman to carry
along his city permit. Not
that the spectacle of one of
Pa Pitt’s patrol wagons cruis-
ing down Fifth avenue with
“Hail to Pitt" rising in shrill
crescendo from its interior was
not really too funny to be
missed. But after all the
whole affair was a pretty bad
mess and did the school no
good. ‘

Therefore, since the police
department demonstrated once
that it apparently was unable
to distinguish minor disorders
from those. requiring riot

The thing to do now is to bend
every effort to make the pro-
posed outdoor pep assembly a
rousing affair.

HE YOUNG WOMEN’S

Christian Association is
about to close its drive for
membership, This annual ap-
peal of the coed, campus re-
ligious organization «always
strikes a. responsive chord in
the sentiment of faculty mem-
bers and undergraduates.

The Y. ‘W. C. A. never talks
too much about its work on
campus, preferring to let acts
speak for themselves. That the
Association occupies a signiﬁ-
cant place among the activities
of the University is demon-
strated by its long existence
here.

Besides an intangible spirit-
ual inﬂuence which the organi-
zation exerts, it is also re-
sponsible for numerous activi-
ties which can be judged more
objectively. It is a unifying
force on the campus for wom-
en enrolled in the University,
and because of this deserves
unstinted support.

Walter Rome and C. Stanton Bel-

as to get caught at high tide?”

“Yeah, can you imagine? These
dumb ﬁshermen don’t know what
it's all about,” opined the assistant
director.

The two men lapsed into a short
silence, as thesawatched the foam-

on the beach and recede‘to the sea.

“Gosh, that water looks good,
doesn’t it, Stan?”,

“And how! What say to a little

Now this peninsula was peculiar-
ly situated. It did not stretch
straight out into the water, but
curved taround the base of a per-
pendicular cliff before it left the
beach. Furthermore, the point
where it turned was obscured to the
vision of anyone at the end of the
peninsula, so that he would be un-
aware of any rise in tide at the
bend.

And that's how it happened that
along toward evening, after the two
men had swum their full, that they
came, fully dressed to the turn of
the strip of land. To their amaze-
ment. the tide had come up and the
foaming sea lay between them and
the beach beyond the cliff.

“To say that we were surprised
would be putting it mildly," is the
way Graduate Manager Rome de-
scribes the way he and Belfour
felt. “We both remembered that
monument and somehow we both
thought that maybe there would
soon be six names where there had
been but four. .

“We knew that our lives depend-
ed upon our working fast. With
the tide coming up higher every
minute, we took off our clothes
and plunged into ‘the sea. The

“My girl and I were both thrown into the tur-

by clinging to a piece of stray timber.”

“How were you saved?” a freshman interro-

  Editor Watches
Public Men Pull Strings-

 

‘By ESTHER MORSE
. “The majority of men before the
public eye are puppets, as a rule,
and it's fun to find out who is be-
hind the scene pulling the strings
and why they're doing it.” This
was the statement made by Mark
Shields, political editor of the Sun-

Tele, when interviewed on his po-

litical writing.

“This is why the writing of poli-
tics is intensely interesting,” he
continued. “It gets tiresome, of
course, for one is constantly con-
fronted with the “Stiff-shirtedness”
of politicians which makes them
reluctant to say anything import-
ant. However, a good reporter can
get people to tell him things with
little difficulty."

When we. had asked, for Mr.
Shields at the Sun-Tele oﬂlce, they
had replied, “Right in here," and
shoved us through a narrow door,
into a. small room blocked off from
the rest of the ﬂoor. 1
I And there sat,Mark Shields, po-
litical editor of the Sun-Tele, look-
ing not atall like we had always
pictured newspaper men. His
hair was neatly combed, he was
immaculately dressed, and he
didn't look as though he were go-
ing to dash out any minute on the
trail of a big story, and leave us
sitting there.

He leaned back in his chair, lit

his pipe, and asked, “What. do you
want me to talk about?"

“Yourself.” ~

Whereupon he talked about
everything else until’ we ﬁnally
managed to break in, “How did
you happen to become a newspaper
man?” - _

He’smiled. “I’ve never _known
any other sort of work. I’ve always
been a. newspaper man. I started
writing amateur sports on a paper
out in Denver, and since then I’ve
been all over the country, holding
all sorts of jobs,’ but always on a
newspaper.” ‘

“I never read my own stories,”
he observed a little later, as he
leafed through a newspaper.
‘‘What’s the use? Today's news-
paper is the deadest thing imag-
inable tomorrow.”

He stuck hispipe in his pocket,
pulled his left foot up on his chair
and nonchalantly clasped his knee.

Of all the jobs in the newspaper,
game, that of the reporter is the‘

greatest. The important thir.g= is
getting the news, and if the news-

paper has a bunch of good “getw

ters” it doesn’t need to worry
about much else.”

“After all,” he concluded, as we
left, “one of the most satisfying
things in my work is helping so-me

young person get started in the

same ﬁeld.”

Those of _you who did not see
“Mrs. Moonlight,” which the Pro-
fessional Players presented at the
Alvin Theater last week, missed
one of the most gracious plays that
ever crossed a Pittsburgh stage.
Not a.-great play, no doubt; nothing
to match, either in text or acting‘,
with even the promise of Ethel
Barrymore in “A School for Scan-
dal.” But something with a decided
charm of its own, with some ﬁne
old gowns and some kind old airs
in it, with a very lovely lady, beau-
tifully dressed and singing-and
what more is to be expected of a.
play in such days as these?

” “Mrs. Moonlight” is a fan-
tasy project against a realis-
tic background. The back-
ground could have been too
realistic, and probably would
have been so if the curtain
had come up on a. 1931 living
room. But Mr. Benn Levy
chose his time element well.
‘The year is 1881, in which fan-
tasy can feel at ease; with its
trails and bows, its square pi-
anos and candles, it is the
proper setting for the delicate
tragedy of Mrs. Moonlight.
vWith such a background, it is
possible to believe everything,
to put reason into a corner for
the evening, to settle back and
enjoy. -

To be sure, there were plenty of
faults: There was not a siﬁgle per-
fect or great actor in the whole
cast. Nobody understated. Every-
body overstated, and Minnie over-

a. bit more bear’s grease and a bit;

act. And even Mr. Moonlight had’
a way of hemming and coughing

too much. But nothing but thor- _
ough skepticism and a bad humor I

could have spoiled the general ef-
fect of the play. Edith Barret very
seldom stepped outside of the

And surely there must be.
some place in the world for
pure and simple graciousness.
It will never hurt the most ar-
dent follower of Bach to listen
to a. pretty voice singing such
songs as “Oh, for the wings,
for the wings of a dove," any- » »
more than it will hurt him to
have some marigolds or tea
roses on his table while he
eats his dinner. The Substance-
of the Theater is its few great.‘
For the rest, there is nothing
but shadow. The world is very
prone to commend the shadow
so long as it is sophisticated,
discussive, biiarre. As for us,
we make bold this once to
commend the less complicated
shadow, in a gracious dress,
singing old airs and simple I
ones. ‘

they are refreshingly different. Blended
from pure tobacco . . . free of oily, foreign
