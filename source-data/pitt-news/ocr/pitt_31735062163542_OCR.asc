_,?Comp‘reheI,1siVe, Study

By PAT POLLINO

The largest, most comprehensive ’study.to date onthe

 trimester system was distributed to "members of Student
_ Government by last year’s SG president," Tom Olofson, “in ~
A_ hopes that “you people, as a. group, should continue to look
 into the matter and carry the ball from, heref’

Olofson told the group. that the implications of -year-

 ’round education — problems andadvantages — are presented in

the 15-page report.

According to Olofson, reactions of one-eighthgof, the student.
population to questions presented in a six-page questionnaire (dis— -"
 tributed winter term of '63) _indicate “the student viewpoint on ‘
 on the trimester system.”

Study in 1961

x The University had released only one complete previous tri- ,
’ vf; mester study, that in 1961. The Ofﬁce of Policy Planning has pre-
conjunction with‘ the 15-page report _

pared a statistical analysis -in

But Olofson’s report, a result of efforts of an SG Trimester
. committee, is the first such student analysis.

As chairman of that committee, Olofson pointed out a number
of noteworthy facts derived from the sample. A few excerpts from
the printed report follow: I

i Never Attended ' ‘

Fifty-ﬁve percent of the sample indicated they had never at-

tended a spring term. Breaking it down even further: 64 percent of. 

students in Liberal Arts, 43 percent in Engineering, 32 percent in
Nursing, 53 percent in Education and 35 percent in Business Admin-

'' istration had never attended a" spring term.

It should be pointed out, however, freshmen responding to
the questionnaire had not been afforded the opportunity of
- attending a spring term. ‘ '- '

The report revealed. that 48 percent favored year-’round edu-

cation, while 35 percent opposed. Forty-six percent -said the .,ava_il-
ability of a trimester calendar at the University was not a ‘major

inﬂuence in their decision to attend; 40 percent "disagreed. .

Lack of Money- _ _ _ .
Compulsory year-’round education found opposition among 76
percent of the sample. Largest single-'reason"given for not having
attended any sprin/g term was lack of money.-' Onlyill percent cited
availability of the trimester as a major reason for having enrolled
in the University. ,  - - -' v

Thirty-two percent tabbed spring trimester instruction as
inferior to that offered in other terms, while. 60 percent could

ﬁnd no difference in instruction among the terms; V — .
A striking statistic arose under ‘the topicf of' extra-curricular

A -activities. It was found that 63 percent did not engage in’ any formal

extracurricular activities during the winter term as compared with
85 percent in the spring. A . _ p * L '
_ _ M A Library Inadequate _ ,
Approximately one-fourth «of the students felt study facilities
and library hours were inadequate during‘ all three trimesters, ‘while
73 percent turned thumbs down on facilities for the spring. "
“This would indicate a change in library setup is deﬁnitely
needed,” Olofson noted. ‘ - A L

Approximately one-'third of thedundergraduates sampled indi-
cated their displeasure toward course selections offered in_ the spring.
High percentage of discord with scheduling evident’ in Liberal Arts
was singled out by Olofson as an urgent need for revision.

Largest School , _ 1 A

“Liberal Arts is the largest single school in the University,” he
said. “Therefore, dissatisfaction can not be passed over lightly by
any means.” ' ' ’ ‘ _ '

After weighing all the facts gathered, the Trimester commit-
'tee has proposed several recommendations. _ . _

It suggests the University expand the variety of courseiofferings
during the spring term, noting that the University has been too con-
servative in “this most important area.” ‘

‘ Should Offer .
_ According to Olofson, “The University should offer the student
what -thestudent should have.”
The report recommends that the quality of instruction in the
spring term he brought up to par with that of the other two terms.

Also cited is the imperative need that parents and students alike
be afforded the opportunity-' to use outside funds for the purpose of
ﬁnancing higher education. , I ’ ' ’

- Expenses Upped
“If you go three terms instead of two,” Olofson said, “your ex-

- penses_ are upped 50 percent. Besides, you lose summer income.”

To assure responsibility on the part of all concerned, the report
_urges that all students be fully and objectively, acquainted with the
complete philosophy behind the inception of year-’round education.

Stress is placed on an honest appraisel'_of the advantages offered‘ as _

well as the difficulties and proble_ms necessitated by its implementation.

tinuing it’s annual literary

demic Award in honor of the
ex-“English, professor, the . com-
petition is open to all under-
graduates wishing to submit
original papers.

The projectsmay be in any of

dents can use any literary form
for their project. Creative works
such as short stories and poetry,
essays that are either ‘critical

studies, and original research
projects are examples of ex-
ceptable works.

Class projects are not eligible,
although works stemming from

award to “encourage scholarly

‘research among the’ undergrad- ,

according to the original.propos-

cording to Miss -Reifman, “to

evening that was marked
by a fantastic display of

from Debussy impressions

_ Because of a publicity con-
ﬂict of time scheduling, the
program began 15 minutes late.
The audience was much smaller
than previous PM gatherings,
possibly out of a lack of under-’ .
standing of contemporary com-
posers and their works. .,

Those who did come in search
of a new learning- experience,
however, were ‘Well rewarded.

Theatre 11 Sparkles

If you were one of the lucky people to have‘ seen the
Theatre 11 production of “Happily Ever After” performed
last week inproom 1126 CL, you saw a supurb rendering of
2 one-act plays by a highly talented quintet of performers
and directed by a very talented young lady. The quintet
consists of Glorianne Engel, Mary Jeanne Deegan, Kathy

“ ‘Happily Ever After’ is a title

devoted towards a satirical and

Romantic Climate
Not one to mince words,
Jacobs termed Arnold Schon-

quiet, carefully wrought, and 'al-
most daintily vivious. In .“The
Boarding House,” the ‘difference

force, brashness and vitality. Miss
Henshaw played the proverbial
marriage. The ﬁrst‘ play, “Mr.
Sleeman is Coming,” was writ-
ten by Hjalnar Bergman, a mod-
ern Scandinavian playwright. The
two old women in thisplay com-
pletely dominate the life of a
young girl. They force her to mar-
ry a horrible old man, although
she is in love with a handsome
young hunter. Bergman has at-
tempted to show the universal

tion. ‘ ' _

She achieved the oscillation
in mood ~ and atmosphere very‘
skillfully thanks to that won-
derful cast. The ﬁve perform-V

——where the chords are not re-
lated to any key scheme.
A la. Leonard Bernstein,
Jacobs. used his piano to ex-
plain his comments.

: - Anton Webern, one of Schon-

berg’s most_famous pupils, had
his only composition ‘for the
piano, “Variations,” Opus 27
(1936) performed, immediately,
following Schonberg’s “Drei
Klavierstucke” Opus 11, (1908).
Webern took the 12 tone series,
and with it “composed. music of
a purity the western world has
not known since Bach.” The 12
tone series, very basically, took

the 12 chromatic halfsteps found ‘

on the piano keyboard and ar-
ranged them in a row forming
a twelve tone scale.

Serves As Example

Jacobs continued, “Weber’s
music is so fascinating that it
has served as an example for
many later composers. His work
has no literary connotations.
The beauty of his music lies in
the music itself.” Jacobs pro-
ceeded to perform the Varia-
tions with technical skill and
expression, highlighting th e
great balance found in this ﬁve
and a half lminute work.

Other works in the first half

    

included “Klavierstuck V”
(1954) by Karlheinz Stock-
hausen, and a second work
by Schonberg entitled “Suite”
Opus 25 (1925). I

The second half of the pro-
gram, while still relatively mod-
ern, was a welcome change of
pace. Even in the case of art for
art’s sake, one can only listen
to atonal and experimental mu-
sic for so long without losing
his own personal perspective.

Recognizeable Melody
There was recognizeable
melody in the four etudes by

Claude -Debussy, though the
works were not bound by any

strict form. Igor Stravinsky was

represented in Jacob's program
through a series of short and
varied pieces. These
ranged from “Piano Rag-music”
through a march, a waltz, and a
“Tango.”

The audience was small,
but highly appreciative. Ja-
cobs was called back by audi-
ence demand time and again.
He played a Debussy com-
position based on a -postcard

 clitorialzi It's Not

Most.studetns feared it was coming; some believed that the University wouldn’t
dare raise tuition again so soon (the last increase was only two years ago), and not a
few expressed their concern that an additional increase wouldn’t permit them to re-

turn to school next year. Well, in any case,’ the raise has been announced and it’s’

really not half as bad’as it sounds. , ,

The Chancellor’s letter to all students and their parents quite clearly demon-
strates the need for the increase. If a university such as this one is to advane aca-
demically, then it must be prepared to meet the rising costs of excellence. Good
professors require attractive salaries to keep them in teaching, and it is impossible
to run an efficient scholastic program without a huge outlay of funds. " p

This, of course, is of" little consolation to the student who fears for his entire
future college career because of the increase, yet looking at the thing objectively and
taking all aspects into consideration, the members of the administration who planned
the new tuition schedule have done an excellent job in minimizing the derogatory
effects which such increases have had in the past, and the result is as painless a plan
as could have been derived. _ , ‘

_ They have abolished the old system of tuition by credit except in the lower
credit number range, and have introduced the ﬂat fee plan which has enjoyed such
popularity at many institutions throughout the country. This will encourage students

to take more courses each year because ﬁfteen credits will now cost as ~much as

up for those extra courses. The increase in tuition which this will cost him, if any,

will be small.

Also-, the University has now abolished the University Fee, Health Fee, Locker
Room Fee, and all those other fees which always seemed to add up astronomically on
each’ invoice. Scholarship and loan funds will also be increased to extend help to those
students least able to afford the new jump. in

Still in all, it is an increase. There’s no getting around‘ that. Unless you take
nineteen credits or had 300 dollars in outside fees each year, it’s going to cost you

’ money. But what could the Un

Chancellor Litchtield, speak-
ing. before students at the first
Administrative Coffee H o u r ,
invited those students‘ with
major ‘problems to write him
a letter. He was mainly re-

ferring to problems concern-

ing segregation and discrim-
ination. About five or six weeks
later, at the second Adminis-
trative Coffee Hour, Dean
Helen Poole Rush said. that

students with major problems

should come to see her.

It is true that both Dean
Rush and Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld invited the students to
come to them with problems.
But how many students did or
will go to see them with their
problems? Most students seem
to fear doing, this. They feel
that these people can not help
them with their problems.
There was at least one group
of students that felt differ-
ently.

Last April some students be-
gan attempts to get a kosher
kitchen on. the University cam-

, pus. Realizing that they could
‘ not accomplish this completely

on their own, they went to the

turned this September, little
progress had been made on the
project. Working on their own,

dents interested in a kosher‘

possible-solutions to where the

not eat in the Towers’ Cafe-

‘By the time Dean Rush made-
her statement, the list of in-_-
terested students had grown to

25. Little else had bee'n'done-

to make this project a reality.
Th e Friday. following Dean
Rush’s talk, however, 14 of the
25 students, plus an advisor,
went to see her and ‘explain
their problem to her. She was
very sympathetic about the
problem, said she understood
it, and would do all she could
to help solve it- "

She explained to the stu-
dents that she did nottknow
how soon she could contact
the other people involved —
Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant
chancellor of student and gen-
eral affairs; Charles Douglas,
director of Saga Food Service;
Maurice Fireman, treasurer of

the. Kosher Restaurant of Pitts- .

By Jacki Katz

The ‘students involved had
little hope of hearing from
Dean Rush before a couple of

weeks had passed. She called’

th e group spokesman, how-
ever, .just three‘ days .after
they spoke to‘ her, and told
him that everything was set

.up; that they could have the
kosher kitchen beginning with.

A the winter. trimester
earlier. 1

if not

One problem aroseiafter that
- phone call: ﬁnancial ‘arrange-
.ment had not been‘ worked out. ’

Even ‘though the project is
not yet a full reality, the stu-
dents involved now realize
that they can turn to Dean
Rush or other administrators
with their major problems.
Other students should also«re-
alize this. 4 /

The time is now ripe for stu-
dents to bring their major
problems to the different ad-
ministrators. Constantly one
hears gripes from all the stu-

dents about the administration - -

and about the action of the ad-
ministration. Students c o In -
plain, but /what else do they
do about the problems?

More students should be like
the 14 that went to see Dean
Rush about their problem con-
cerning a kosher~ kitchen on
this campus. These students
realized that the administra-
tion wants to help students as
much as possible. Other stu-
dents can lear the same thing.
All they have to do.is go to
Dean Rush or some other ad-
ministrator if they feel they
have a major problem.

Dean Rush invited the stu-

dents to come talk to her about '

their large problems. Chancel-
lor Litchﬁeld invited the stu-
dents to write him letters con-
cerning their main problems.

Grad Expresses View i

This is a "copy of a letter
addressed to Chancellor Litch'-
ﬁeld sent to us by the authof.
‘ T h e editor advises a. careful
reading. ,
Dear Chancellor Litchﬁeld:

, On Thanksgiving Day, many
people were witness to the
spectacle of a strong Texas
Longhorn team (9-0) soundly

thrashing a weak<Texas Aggie
team’ (2-7, I -- think) by the X

lop-sided score of 15 to 13.

In‘ view, of this outstanding
perforrriance, I do. not know.

how many. people who are in-
terested in the game _of foot-

ball need any additional con- ‘

vincing that Texas is entitled

to be rated No. 1 in the coun‘-.

try.

Because of the. relatively me-
diocre performance of this
year?s, University of Pittsburgh
football team, there is_ little
room left to_ wonder why Pitt
has not received a Bowl bid.
It does not _appear, at least to

, me, that the Panthers play the

same caliber of football that
the Longhorns do.

However, in the interest of .

good sportsmanship, and since
it‘ does not appear that our
University is about to receive
a major Bowl bid," that you
might ‘ consider extending Pitt’s
football season an additional

A After all, they could‘prob- ,

While I would" hesitate to

suggest that such a scrimmage

both "teams a little _extra in-

In The Spotlight C

with Stan Schweiger

~:.- If I had enough money I
would send loads and loads
of New Year’s Greetings to
all those individuals who
made the past year a mem-
orable one for attending
motion pictures and the thea-
tre. Here is my golden oppor-

'my admiration and respect for
the past year’s contributions to
a group of creators who deserve
the highest plaudits.

Let’s begin with the women
and avoid all threatening letters
from my female companions." I
realize that what follows may

/prove to be the ultimate in
name-dropping, but a greeting-

. card list is a greeting-card list

and there is no other way for
me to approach the situation.
“But I digres.s,” as the fellow
says so onward . .. . During the‘
past theatrical season, the num-
ber of women -creators who
made my attending the theatre
,a rewarding -experience, are

‘”"’< very few and far between.

Those coming to mind quickly
are’ Vivien Leigh,
Leighton, Anna Quale and Uta
Hagen. They were, or are cur-
rently, starred in “Tovarish,”
_“Tchin-'I‘chin,”“‘Stop the World
——I Want to - Get Off,” _and
“Who’s Afraid of ' Virginia
Woolf?” The only female play-
wright to get a rose from me
%is Jean Kerr, _who gave birth to

~"‘a girl—after ﬁve boys, and also

‘made a .million dollars with a
delightful thing called “Mary,
No' lady producers or
directors this. time around.

Females Frightening

The situation with the mo-

4 tion pictures of the past year

pertaining to females is almost

\‘_ frightening. I think’ Hollywood

{will want to. forget this past

"fyear_when the ﬁnal totals are

accumuted. Usually there ..-are

at least ﬁve good performances‘

to come out of fantasy—land
each year but 1963 was as. arid
as the Sahara. Only Doris Day
in “The Thrill of it All,” and
Patricia Neal in “Hud”, came
Ahrough solidly for our side.
Even Wendy Hiller and Geral-
dine Page were forced to step

i"3,_-,down a notch because of that

brutal version of “Toys in the
Attic.” Sad to relate, the for-
eigners receive all~the accolades
this year. Leslie Caron in -“The
L-Shaped R o o 111,” Margaret
Rutherford in “The V.I.P’s” and
“Marder at the Gallop,” Rachel
Roberts in “-This Sporting Life,”

tunity, in this last issueof the;
;é’Pitt News for 1963, to express

Margaret -

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

and Anouk Aimee in “81/2”
completely overshadowed their
American sisters on the screens.
At least one woman in the writ-
ing ﬁeld did herself and her
profession proud and that was
Harriet Frank, who,/along with
Irving Ravetch, wrote the year's
best American ﬁlm, “Hud.” In
_the ﬁeld of television the queens
of the hill were Ingrid Berg-
man, who gave some class to
the medium with, her“ portrait
of “Hedda Gab1er”; Mary Tyler
Moore, who does a lovely job
as Dick" Van Dyke’s wife in
t.v.’s best and most intelligent
comedy show; and Judy Gar-
land, who is and always will be
just Judy Garland, and that’s
enough for me. ' '
To say that the past season
in the theatre, movies, and
television has been a. mascu-
line one would be making an
understatement of vast de-

grees. ‘It has been a ﬁne year '

for acting and for production
in all ﬁelds oft he mass media
both in the United States_.and
across the seas.

The magic names in the the-
atres in the season past were
old-favorites and new and wel-
come discoveries. From the
acting those who gave me much
pleasure with their vast'_abili-
ties in musical comedy, drama
and comedy were: Robert Morse
in “How to Succeed in Business,
etc.,” the four iconoclastic
brainstorms from “Beyond the
'Fringe,”. namely’ Alan Bennett,
Dudely Moore, Johnathan Mil-
ler, and Peter Cook; Zaro Mos-
tel in “A Funny Thing Hap-
pened on the. Way to the
Forum,” “Clive” Revill in “Oli-
ver,” Jason Robards, Jr..in._“A
Thousand Clowns,” Alan Arkin
‘in “Enter Laughing,” Paul Ford
in “Never Too Late,” and Ar-

.thur ‘Hill in “Who’s Afraid of.

Virginia Woolf?” From the be-
hind-thpe--scenes department to
the forefront of my mind come
such people as David Merrick,
to some fond moments of the
1963 year, moments that in some
way made life pleasant and re-

who continued in the tradition
of P.T. Barnum by presenting
no less than six shows at one
time, Edward Albee who wrote
the exciting ‘Virginia Woolf
. . .” Anthony Newley, who
wrote the book and lyrics, ‘di-
rected and starred in “Stop the
World . . .” Alan Schneider,
who directed “Virginia Woolf,”
and Peter Glenville, ‘who di-
rected both “Tchin-Tchi-n,” and
“Tovarich,” Quite a" year for
men on Broadway!

Year of Newman

_The same holds true for the
motion pictures of 1963. This
was the year for Paul‘ Newman,
Irving Ravethch "and Martin
Ritt to give us “I-Iud,” a most
unforgettable ﬁlm, for Jack
Lemon to romp through Billy
Wi1der’s “Irma La Douce,” for
Rex Harrison to make Julius
Caesar his personal triumph,

for Joe Mankiewicz to weather ‘

the storm and bring “Cleopa-
tra”- to the public, for John
Sturgess James Garner and
Steve McQueen to combine ef-
forts and give us “The Great
Escape,” ‘a wonderfully excit-
ing adventure, for Sean Con-_
nery to bring James Bond to
life. From abroad the mascu-

. line power was generated by

Richard Harris in “This Sporting
Life,” Burt Lancaster and Lu-

, chino Visconti in “The Leop-

ard,” Ingmar Bergman in‘“Win—
ter Light,” and ‘last but far
from least, Marcello Mastro-
ianni and "Federico Fellini, who
combined their talents to’ make
“81/2” the ﬁnest moment in any
‘form of mass media‘ that my
eyes have seen this past year.
Television’s men of the year for
this department are George C‘.
Scott and his “East Side-West
Side”. co—workers,‘ Carl Reiner
and Dick Van, Dyke, Danny"
Kaye, and every newsman at
the helm during this last unbe-

lievable ordeal.

I have tried to mention those
responsible for my enjoyment or
interest this past season. I’m
sure I have missed a fewialong
the way. "

’TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY

If you have been reading this column~and I hope you have; 
' mean I genuinely hope so; I mean it does not proﬁt me one
penny whether you read this column or not; I mean I am paid
every Week by the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes and my
emolument is not affected in any way by the number of people
who read or fail to read this column—an act of generosity
perfectly characteristic of the makers of Marlboro, you would
say if you knew them as I do; I mean here are tobacconists gray
at the temples and full of honors who approach thciriart as
eagerly, as dewy-eyed as the youngest of practitioners; I mean
the purpose of the Marlboro makers is simply to put the best of
all possible ﬁlters behind the best of all possible tobaccos and
then go, heads high, into the market place with their wares,
conﬁdent that the inborn sense of right and wrong, of good and
bad, of worthy and unworthy, which is the natural instinct_of
every American, will result in a modest return to themselves
for their long hours and dedicated laBors—not, let me hasten to
add, that money is of first importance to the makers of Marlboro;
all these simple men require is plain, wholesome food, plenty of
. Marlboros, and the knowledge that they have scattered a bit of
sunshine into the lives of smokers everywhere; if,.I say, you
have been reading this column, you may remember that last
week we started to discuss Christmas gifts. A

 

We agreed, of course, to give cartons of Marlboro to all our
friends and also to as many total strangers as possible. Today
let us look into some other welcome gifts.

Do you know «someone who is interested in American history?
' If so, he will surely appreciate a statuette of Millard Fillmore
with 9. clock in the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was
the only American president with a clock in the stomach.
James K. Polk had a. stem-winder in his head, and William
Henry Harrison chimed the quarter-hour,.but only Mr. Fillmore,
of all our chief executives, had a clock in the stomach. Franklin
Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary Taylor had
seventeen jewels, but, I repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore
alone had a clock in the stomach. Some say that Mr. Fillmore
was also the ﬁrst president with power steering, but most
historians assign this distinction to Chester A. Arthur. How-
ever, it has been established beyond doubt that Mr. Fillmore
was the first president with a thermostat. Small wonder they
called him Old Hickory!)

But I digress. To get back to welcome and ‘unusual Christmas
gifts, here’s one that’s sure to please-—a gift certiﬁcate from the
American Chiropractic Society. Accompanying each certiﬁcate
is this Winsome little poem:

Merry Christmas, H dppy New Year,

Joyous sacro-iliac! ’

May your spine forever shine,

Blessings on your aching back.

May your lumbar ne'er grow number;

orld’s Fair Job

In conjunction with the University Placement Service,
Joe Seiger inquired as to the possibilities of employment for
college students at the World’s Fair. His ﬁnding is that
thousands of students will be needed.
1:... _.,.~..%'Because of the trimester system, University students
0 - have anladvantageover others. Since the trimester ends on

April 15,’ they can start’ workingé

when the fair opens, either April
21 or 22. Most students can’t
start working until the summer.

Different organizations are han-

' dling different aspects of employ-

ment at the fair. Pinkerton’s De-
tective Agency is taking care of
‘employment recruitment, the ex-
giibitions and the people working
at the exhibits. a ‘

Greyhound, operating under the
title “Greyhound Working at the

Several foreign students at the
Uriiversity made a‘trip to Wash-
ington to pay hommage to the
late President John Fitzgerald
Kennedy at the Arlington Nation-
al cemetery.

The students left early Satur-
day morning, visited the cemetery‘
in the afternoon, did a little sight-

seeing and returned the same eve- -

ning."

The office of Congressman
William Hoorehead extended
courtesies to the visiting stu-
dents from Pittsburgh and a
meeting with Jacqueline Ken-
nedy was also being arranged
through his oﬁice.

A spokesmanlfor the group said

that originally they had ‘planned
to lay a wreath at President-Kem
nedy’s grave but now the money

«will be used to establish a scholar-

ship fund in his name at the uni-
versity for deserving foreign stu-
dents.

‘Aid will be sought throughout

the country and if sufficient funds
are forthcoming the program may
be extended to students at other
universities in the states with the

V i':I‘he1procedure for the removal

ofithe 5G grade will be modiﬁed
starting in January, 1964, accord-
ing to an announcement released
by. Dean Russell A. Dixon, As-
sistant Dean of Liberal Arts.
‘Dean’ Dixon noted that “the
incomplete grade of G was
created to protect those few
students who were unable to
complete a small part of a
small part of a course (normally
a: ﬁnal examination) because of
circumstances beyond their con-
trol. A conﬁning illness, a. sub-
poena to appear in court, or a.
death i_n,.the family are three
qualifying circumstances.”

oniSet"t‘,fo

      

  
  

 

According to the new procedure,
students are‘ to go‘ to the Office of
the Dean of the" School of the
Liberal Arts as early “in the term
as possible, with evidence of the
circumstances justifying the G
grade. “The Dean’s approval,” ac-
cording to Dean Dixon, “will be a
signed authorization to purchase
the required change of grade card
in the Oiﬁce of Student Accounts.

“This pink-edged, card, validat-
ed prior to February 7, will in-
form the instructor of the student’s

eligibility to complete the requir-.

ed work. The entire process must
be completed within.the first six
weeks as previously required.”

.-Cleea Club To 
During World’rs Fair

By NANCY FUCHS

Men’s Glee Club will sing at the New York World’s
Fair April 25, three days after it opens in Flushing
Meadow ‘Park, N.Y.

Walter Giebelhaus, program director of the Fair,
wrote a letter to the singing group, conﬁrming the date.
Charles Saladino, Glee Club business manager, had

‘written originally to ask if the Fair could use their

services.

According to Saladino, “We do not know anything
about other college groups that may be singing at the
Fair, but since we ar.e going topappear so‘ soon after
the opening, we will probably be one of theﬁrst.”

The fair engagement, a ﬁrst for the Glee Club, will
mark the end of another ﬁrst —— a singing tour between

trimesters. The. week-long tour ‘between April ,.19 and

25 will carry the Glee Club to several women’s colleges
and possibly a few’ high schools in New York.‘

The. group will sing with‘ female vocal groups at
Russell Sage College and Ladycliff College, and will pre-
sent a public concert at East Meadow on Longlsland
April 22. The concertiwill be taped by a local radio
station on Long Island. -

“The Glee Club has made its tour during the
winter trimester in the ‘past, but we are doing _it
this way now to avoid class conflict and of course, to
take advantage of the opportunity to sing at the
World’s Fai_r,” Saladino explained.‘

During the winter trimester the Glee Club will hold
concerts with local women’s colleges, nursing schools,
and regionalcampuses. They will sing at Chatham, Mt.
Mercy, and Allegheny colleges, the nursing schools of
Presbyterian and West Penn Hospitals, and Titusville.
Mendelsohn’s “Elijah” will be on the program at all the
women’s colleges except Chatham.

The Glee Club also plans to join Women’s Choral in-_
the annual winter concert Friday at 8:30 p.m. in the SU ‘

Ballroom.‘ The group has been ‘asked to sing at the
Sweetheart Ball, partof the Winter Weekendfestivities.
The wide variety of songs in the Glee_Club’s re-
pertoire ranges‘ from “Gigi” and “The Happy Wand-
erer” to a selection of English Glees,_.sung’ in pubs
ingthe 18th century. , B ,
Smanuel Rubin directs. the group. Officers include:
Ron Davis, president; Ray Davis, vice-president; Al Rich,
secretary; Jim Rossen, treasufrer;:Ch_arles Saladino, bus-
iness manager; and Roy Meckler and Dave . Savage,
publicity. . ‘ _ '

 

s.1...1...s1.i,.   Rule  

Delta Tau Delta at the Decem-
ber 3 meeting of the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council, framed a motion
designated to hold up application
of last winter’s scholarship ruling
until the 1964 fall trimester, in-

Book On Kennedy
Appears In J an.

(Continued from Page 1)
preface by Bruce Catton, historian
and senior editor of American
Heritage Magazine.

‘Hard Cover

The book will be published in
hard covers, the content based on
UPI’s news and _picture coverage
beginning with the late Presi-
dent’s arrival in Dallas, Nov. 22,
and ending with his burial Nov.
25 in Arlington National Cemetery.

Selections for the picture
pages are being -made from
thousands of black and white
and color photographs made by‘
UPI photographers during ‘the
four-day week end.

Many of UPI’s dispatches will
be reproduced just as they were
written by reporters who covered
the -momentous events.

The book, as now planned, will
be at least 128 pages long and ac-
cording .to Kleinberg, “will be the
type of book that students will
wish to keep for a lifetime.”

Reservation Blank

-In the _ﬁrst issue of The Pitt-
News for next term, a reserva-
tion blank will be printed in the
paper so that students wishing to
purchase a copy or copies of the
book will be able to reserve the
number they wish. A box will be
setup in the SU to collect‘ the
reservation slips. Nov advance
peyment is necessary.

“Through the cooperation of
Mr. Balagna, director of the Book
Store, we have been able to make
this ‘offer ‘available’ to students
here at the University,” remarked
Kleinberg, “and we are positive
thatthe entire shipment of 1,500

books which we have ordered -will

disappear quite rapidly.”

stead of instituting the require-
ment in January, 1964 as sched-
uled.

Last winter, the IFC passed a
motion stating that fraternities be-
longing to the council would, in
the future, be required to main-
tain an average QPA of 2.25 (as
compared to the school minimum
of 2.0) to. avoid a council—insti-

‘tuted social probation.

More than one group thought

that this ruling was rushed. These '

groups felt that certain technical
aspects, with only six weeks left
in that winter term, were too
vague.
-Example Cited

One area of question was the

point at which a man can be drop-

ped from a "roster and still not

have his average count towards

"the overall fraternity QPA.

In opposition to this motion
Phi Kappa Alpha stated that
“we are on a scholarship push;
it we delay the motion we’ll
look bad.” 0

Mark Bebko, Council president,
mentioned in passing that last
winter’s ruling allowed for excep-
tions to be taken into account. He
felt, however, that the ruling
should not be dropped because.
this would be a sign of drop-
ping out in face, of hardship.

Motion Defeated

,Wh_en put to a vote, the motion
was defeated 13-7. This indicated

Funny "Valentine, ‘Romain,
Dream Gypsy, Skating in
Central Park, It Hear a
Rhapsody, Darn that Dream;
PERSONNEL: Evans,
Hall, guitar."
Only infrequently does an
album come along that domi-
nates one’s musical -attention.
' One that can be a balm for your
‘fw.'ounds,” one -that offers a
listening reward at the end of
the day. “Undercurrent” is just
' -such an album. It’ is the meet-
’ ing of two men of the first rank
 jazz — both superb techni-
cians, but affecting lyricists. '
Evans is the nonparcil pianist
whose work has ‘delighted ev-
eryone in jazz from Miles Davis
.. to Roland Kirk. He is the “in-
.flue-ncer” these, days. Younger .
‘pianists, if they imitate any-
body, imitate Evans.
Hall is —a guitarist whose ta-
lents are only now becoming
known to the public.‘I-Ie cur-
‘ _‘rently works with Art Farmer
in a small group and has re-
-corded —with such people as
Sonny Rollins, Gerry Mulligan
and Paul Desmond. His West

yagainst him for awhile but he
appears to be overcoming the
stigma in earning recognition.

“Valentine” is perhaps the
_most. interesting work on the
-album. It is done in a faster
tempo than usual for that work.
Hal1’s improvising is intriguing
 as well as exciting — as he
goes from a choral backing to a
single note lead, then subtly to
a rhythm-guitar backing with
' ‘accents which makes the num-

could make it.

BOB SDIIZIK

. wise.

Their booing of opposing players and oﬂicials, which
-had been considered just fanatical support for their team,

_. has always been sportsmanship of the lowest caliber.
TA Typical Example

No better example was shown Friday night when a
Duquesne rooter stood up in the second row of the
student section and swore at the official -at the top of his
lungs. The call was so obviously correct that the person

. making the crude remark must have been mentally deﬁ-
cient.

Somehow, I don’t know where I got the idea, I
felt the Duquesne basketball team was above this sort
ofaction. It was up to Willie Somerset to prove me
wrong. V

Somerset fouled out of the game in overtime. The

* man he fouled—-—B‘rian Generalovich———extended his hand

to help Somerset up oﬁ the ground, but Willie brushed
‘aside the gesture and walked off the court. Somerset and
Generalovich were teammates on two state championship
basketball teams.

Shows His Class M

Somerset further exhibited his class by heading

. straight for the locker room after the game and not wait-

ing around for the presentation of the trophies. Somerset
w‘on the Most Valuable Player award, but Duquesne

‘ coach Red Manning had to accept it for him because Sulk-

.ing Willie was brooding downstaires. .

Duquesne students showed what they’re like
when Harry Stuhldreher, one of N otre Dame’s famed
Four Horsemen, stepped onto the court to present
the team trophy to Pitt. .

The»Duquesne section let loose with a chorus of
boos that would not subside. Stuhldreher_ merely pre-
sented the trophy to Pitt without saying anything. The
. booing was too loud. A '
The Pitt section could have booed ‘at times during the
night, but they had too much class. The announcement
that Somerset was chosen as MVP was met with disqust
here. Perhaps Somerset was the most outstanding player
on the ﬂoor, but he certainly wasn’t the most valuable.
Duquesne had a far superior team than Westminster,
the team it beat in the ﬁrst round. They could have won
without Somerset. That being the case Duquesne was not
better off with Somerset. They would have come in
second with him or without him. Therefore, his value to
his team was certainly not worthy of earning him the
Most Valuable Player award.

Cal Shefﬁeld scored 34 points during the tourna-
ment and seemed a much more logical choice than
Somerset.

Though Pitt fans showed no hard ‘feelings over Som-
erset’s selection, it did not rub off on the Duquesne play-
ers. When the Panther team walked the length of the
court to shake hands with the Dukes after the presenta-
tions_were made, the Dukes turned and left the court. A
gesture calculated to bring pride to former Duquesne
player Mike Rice.

Duquesne claims that they want to play Pitt on a
regular basis and not just in the Steel Bowl. After the
performance of Saturday night it’s not hard to see why
the Panthers would like to see as little of Duquesne as

 

Gridders Squeak by Nittany Lions >-
As Leeson, Mazurek Lead Surge  

By / AL BLUMKIN

For the ﬁrst time in the
university life of the major-
ity students here, the Pan-
ther football team scored a
victory over their arch-rival
Penn State,.22—21. The mar-

gin of victory was negligi-
ble, but enough to make this
Panther aggregation the win-
ningest since 1937.

The Panthers‘ made their
ninth victory In ten starts the
hardest. Penn State scored two
of its three touchdowns as
a result of Pitt mistakes. In
the ﬁrst quarter, punter Tom
Black failed to get his kick
away fast enough and it was
blocked by Penn State. The
Lions scored in three plays to
take 7-0 lead. ‘

Later quarterback Fred Ma-
zurek fumbled on the Panther
36 and State drove over in six-
plays. “That’s been Mazurek’s
biggest fault this year, the fum-
bles,” said coach John Michelo-
sen. The last Lion touchdown
came naturally,
touchdown drive. ‘

When the Panthers didn’t
make mistakes they were
busy rolling up yardage. Ma-
zurek had another .200 plus
day as he racked up 142
yards on the ground and 108
through the air. He scored
the winning touchdown in the
last quarter on a 17-yard run.

Rick Leeson also had one of
his better days. The big full-_
back rushed for 70 yards,
kicked a vital ﬁeld goal and

was the key man in one of‘

the most unusual plays seen
around these parts in a long
time. Black was sent in to punt,
but the snap went to Leeson,
the short man, and he rambled
for 34 yards. “Rick called the

play," said Michelosen. “In fact, .

we never had such a play un-
til (last) Monday.”

A key play was made when
safetyman Glenn Lehner saved
a touchdown‘ for the Panthers.
Late in the game, Lion speed-
ster Don Caum, was beating
Lehner to the ball onia Liske
pass. Lehner, - sensing a sure
touchdown, pushed Caum, caus-
ing him to drop the ball. Pass
interference was called on Leh-
ner, but the Lions didn’t score.

The victory was satisfying
to Michelosen and_the play-
ers. “I thought this game was
one of the toughest we played
all year,” said Mazurek. “Any
time you win, it’s satisfying.
We gave t h e m "breaks, but
the boys bounced back,” add
ed Michelosen. »

The triumph completed the
most successful season the Pan-
thers have kn own since the
days of Jock Sutherland in
1937. The gridders scored 236

points this year, the most since ,

1931. Mazurek piled up 1,679
yards rushing and passing to
set a new Panther standard by
over 300 yards. ’

Despite the tremendous year,
the Panthers have been snubbed
by the major bowls for reasons
only the bowl committees know.
The future was almost sealed
when Navy and Air Force ac-
cpted bids to the Cotton and
Gator Bowls, respectively. A
post—season game against Ore-
gon in the Sun Bowl may be
waiting if athletic director
Frank Carver accepts. ' 1-

1 Sun Bowl , Passes Panthers
After Showing, Great Interest

The last ‘hope for a bowl bid for the Panther football team
was extinguished last "night when the Sun Bowliselection com-
mittee announced that Oregon will meet Southern Methodist in

-the annual Sun Bowl played at El Paso, Texas.

The Panthers had received a feeler from the Sun Bowl Sat-
urday night. The athletic department was told that if the Pan-
thersaccepted an invitation to play in El Paso they would face
Oregon and the chances were very strong that the game would
be televised nationally since the attraction was such a good one.

A representative of the Bowl said that if Oregon and
Pitt met the date of the game would be switched from
Dec. 31, a Tuesday, to Dec- 28, a Saturday, so that the game
could be put an national television. ' ' _

An early report had athletic director Frank Carver saying,
“We are interested in the Sun Bowl, but I’ll have to talk it
over with many people ﬁrst.” 4 ' 9

After it was announced that Oregon would meet SMU,
rather than Pitt, the athletic department said that “it is doubt-
ful if we would have accepted if a bid was oﬂfered.”

The selection of SMU over Pitt follows the recent trend of
snubbing the Panthers in favor of lesser-regarded teams. ‘

The Mustangs lost Saturday to Baylor, 20-6, and are not
ranked nationally. To their credit is the fact they own a
victory over Navy, the only loss sufferedby the Middies this

season. I

Oregon's credentials are no more “impressive. They lost to
two teams that the Panthers beat -— Washington and Penn
State.

The Panthers lost out on any chance they had to attend
a major bowl Saturday when Navy outlasted Army, 21-15,
to gain the Cotton Bowl bid and the Air Force squeezed by
weak Colorado, 17-14, to gain the Gator Bowl bid.

The football team has its best record since 1937, a number
three ranking in the United Presslnternational national ratings,
and. the stigma of being the most unwanted team in recent
history. — By BOB SMIZIK

‘AtzerVerator’s’ Chair Grows Hot

By JIM« 0’BRIEN

In a sorticulture ﬁrst, Leo “Horse” Czar-
necki, the grounds and maintenance director

, here, was hung in effigy on the Duquesne cam-
‘pus this weekend. 7

_It was Czarnecki, acting as official timekeeper
during the Steel Bowl basketball tournament,
who ruled that the buzzer had sounded before
John Cegalis scored what would have been the

winning ﬁeld goal for the Dukes in their cham- .

pionship game with Pitt Saturday night.

The Duquesne fans were ready to revolt
against Czarnecki because the Panthers won in
overtime, 69-67.

On the shot by Cegalis, Czarnecki said, “He
had the ball in his hands when the hem blew.”

Czarnecki, a multilinguist who dabbles in
Stengelese—like double talk, had to be. escorted
to the dressing room by the police, a courtesy
normally reserved for -near-sighted referees.

Horse "sits in a seat at the Field House with
the impressive label “Field House Atzcrverator

—-No Others.” It’s a title he made up. But no’

one ‘dares sit there.

On Saturday the Duquesne fans coined a few
titles for Czarnecki, none as original as “atzer-
vator,” but unmentionable because this is not
the Police Gazette.

“People were calling me the worst names,"-

said Czarnecki. “I had to make the scene.”

Horse said he was doing an honest job, but
said it made no difference. “They.had their
minds made up before the fact,” he claimed.

“If it was Bishop Sheen out there, they’d' a
strangled him,” he said. “They’re rabid fans.
Which they should, be. Students should get ex-
cited, but they got carried away.” ’

Horse said a lot of people thought that Red
Manning, Duquesne’s coach, swore at him for

his costly call. This is not so, says Horse. “He

didn’t cuss at me at all. He pointed his ﬁnger
right at my eye, it was so close I could’ve bit
it, and said, ‘How are you going to sleep tonight,
Horse?’ . ,

“I/said, ‘I’l1 sleep..How about you?’ People
don’t know‘ it, but I didn’t get out of here until
twelve that night. I had to wait ’till the heat
was off. But I goteight good hoirrs of sleep, and

7 Zelkowitz Cops Yogi Crown,
’ Finishes With .709 Percentage

Marvin “Isaiah’,’ Zelkowitz predicted in the beginning of
the season that he would ride his ﬂaming chariot to the top
of the yogi contest. His chariot" sputtered at ﬁrst, resurged in
the midst of the season, and falteredyagain.

With one week in the yogi contest remaining, the prophet
trailed the players by one game. But the prophet never gave.
up hope. Even last week he predicted, “Lo, I have faltered,
but I shall win the contest. ' -*-

 After 69-67 Overtime Victory 

I don’t know-nothing that happened in between.”
Czarnecki cited Manning for stopping a
storming of the timekeeper’s table. “I give him
credit,” he said. “He told his players to get back
to the bench. He kept me from getting mayhem-
med out.
“I was just beginning to make it big and now

_I come down like a shotput ball,” said Czar-

necki, a character burgeoning. «“Now I’m
through. You think Duquesne will ever let me
work again?” J i

It is an unfortunate position that Czarnecki
has been put in — the “atzervater’s” chair. It’s
about as hot-‘as the one in San Quentin right
now.

Horse assumed the job. this season when

-Bobby Lewis, Pitt’s baseball coach, quit because

of his nerves. This job is as demanding and
tension-ﬁlled as a stock broker’s.

Lewis was a goat of sorts last winter for his
role in Pitt’s 69-68 defeat here by West Virginia.
The Mountaineers Tom Lowry sunk a shot with

seven seconds remaining, but Lewis did not stop
the clock until the referee signaled to him. The
delay cost the Panthers four valuable seconds.

When Pi_tt put the ball in play, Dave Roman
dribbled across midcourt and sank a fantastic 35-

foot jump shot—-that didn’t count. Ben Jinks had-

called for another time out, the referee had
signaled the same to Lewis, and he promptly
stopped the clock. The shot was nulliﬁed.

“I felt so terrible,” Lewis said at the time. “I

~ knew that we didn’t win. I knew the way the

students and the players were feeling.”

He said then he didn’t think he’d be time-
keeper this year. “I want Pitt to win so badly,
but I wouldn’t cheat. It tears me up inside, just
sitting there. I‘ can’t show any emotional signs
because I’m an ofﬁcial‘. I’ve got to get _back in

the stands and let off some steam. This is bad
' for my health. It even makes me nervous.”

Now it is Horse’s health that is -of concern.
“My body prevails,” he cried. “I wouldn’t be
seen within a mile radius of the Duquesne cam-
pus until this blows over.”

The Panthers travel to Wisconsin tomorrow.
The Badgers blew a 22 point lead and bowed to
Ohio U5, 77-75, at home in Madison last Saturday.

Swimming coach Ben Grady ishopeful that his team
can come up with a more successful performance when
they meet New York University this Saturday at 8 p.m. at
Trees'Hall than they did in their season opener against
North Carolina State, Nov. '30.. '

The swimmers lost thatone, 49-46, but according’ to

' ' - Grady the fault was his, not
the teams.

Grady said, “We know that

Frosh coach Carl Peterson said

if _the players show improvement

during the season, “I am

The team proved that they were in good spirits by presenting
’~ Steve Ganong with the Goat Award. The Goat Award goes to i
te swimmer who according to his teammates failed most to
live up to expectations in the previous meet. Ganong gracious-
accepted the award and completed the solemn ceremony by plac-
ing the goat on the ten meter diving platform.
Barry Rosen, Wayne Pappert "and Ron Levine were nomin-
ated for the award, but they all ﬁnished far behind Ganong.
Co-Captain Wayne Pappert had a few words about NYU
from what he has seen in swimming them for the past two years.
, Pappert said, “They have a good team with a "few good swim- A
xi.» mers. We beat them last year, but they gave us a good meet.”
- The other co-captain, Rob Levine, said, “’l‘-hey’re good, but
I think we’re better.” Rob Levine also thought that the Pan-
thers jswam a good meet against North Carolina State, but
that the team’s performance would be better in future meets.
Grady expressed some doubt about‘ freestyle sprinter Tom.
Ribarchak’s ankle. Ribarchak did not swim against North Caro-
lina State and it is doubtful if he’ll swim against NYU.

Chancellor Explains Rationale

(Continued from Page 1)

released this fall, the U.S. Ofﬁce
of Education reported that the
median tuition charged for under-
graduates in 851 private colleges
and universities across the coun-
try increased by more than 38%
between the academic years 1958-
59 and 1962-63 alone. Our own
increase schedule for 1964-65 is
only a local manifestation of this
larger condition.

Finally, it should be noted that
the increase merely maintains the
University of Pittsburgh at a com-
parable level of cost with other
institutions of like quality and
service. A recent survey showed
that the average tuition for a two-
term academic year at ﬁfteen such
other institutions is currently $293
higher than that at Pitt and still
will be some $196 higher than Pitt
in 1964-65.

The University will do all that
it can to lighten this added
burden of exepense to you. We
would like to remind you of the
facilities which are available to
every Pitt student for complet-
ing his education: '

Educational Loans: Commercial
banks and the University oﬂfer a
wide range of loan plans. Our
Student Aid Olﬁce can give you
additional information on how to
secure such loans.

Scholarships: The University
makes available a large fund for
scholarship purposes. While the
fund cannot cover all needs, it is
administered to provide the most
beneﬁt to the most worthy and
those most in need of ﬁnancial
help. As has been the case in the
past, these funds now will be in-

Answering a few questions
after the concert, the 33-year-
old pianist was asked to com-
ment on present day jazz and
on rock-and-roll. While neither
of these present major interests

as a very important part of our

felt enormously. Miss Engel,
who appears to be a very ex-
perienced young actress, was
the simple,‘ child-like, sister in
Mr. Sleeman” and was the bois-
terous, cantankerous house-
keeper in the next play. Miss
Deegan was a cunning and de-
vious sister in the ﬁrst and then
became the Madison Ave.-con-
scious boarder in the second
play. Miss English was the poor
young thing, and the inn “The
Boardinghouse” she was the
voluptuous sex-goddess. Mr.
—Maradan was the loving hunt-
er in the ﬁrst and the rebel-
turned-statue‘ of “The Board-
inghouse.” Mr. Lazaro played

the old and decrepid Mr. Slee-
man, and played the mad in-
center in the second play.

These performers were out-
standing in every way through-
out the two plays and it is a trib-
ute to their talent and to Miss
Henshaw’s able direction that
each performance and action
should be perfectly ﬁtted to the
varying moods created. Particu-
larly outstanding was Miss En-
gel’s Nina in “Mr. Sleeman” and
Miss English’s Gloria and Mr.
Maradan’s Sonny in “The Board-
inghouse.” The evening was a rich
and rewarding one for performers
and audience alike. If you missed
these plays, count yourself as un-
lucky.
