Lobby effort or iunket?

Student leaders campaign in capital

.M¢9<=rv .l3‘.."‘.’.i.§.'$.i.  . . -

   

Six representatives of the Student
Government Board and two Black Action
Society members will take a trip to a lob-
bying conference which some students
are calling a junket.

The SGB’s Governmental Relations
Committee received $3,600 from the stu-
dent activities fees in February to fund a
ﬁve-day trip to Washington, D.C. for a
United States Student Association confer-
ence next week.

The question remains: How does this
costly trip beneﬁt the students this group
claims to represent‘?

Although the GRC had argued that
they needed funding for as many students
as possible to “secure a diverse represen-
tation of students on campus,” they failed
to meet the deadline to place an ad in local
papers about applications for the posi-
tions.

The Process

Organizers for the event admit they
never put up posters, stormed domrs, set
up tables around campus, or distributed
ﬂiers.

“Timing just wasn’t on our side,” said
GRC Chair Adam Neary.

Neary said that applications for the
positions went out the Friday before
spring break and were due in seven days.
The GRC sent letters to the organizations
on campus to say they were seeking appli-
cants, but admitted that the general stu-
dent population was uninfomred.

“We chose our delegation from the 12

applicants based mostly on their inter-
views, not on their backgrounds,” Neary
said. “We were looking for involvement
with student rights and looked for people
who could bring things that they learned at
the conference back to campus.”

While campaigning for funds for the
trip, the GRC and its supporters said they
justiﬁed the need for a diverse group of
Pitt students to represent student concerns
in the 15 policy meetings, or caucuses, at
the political conference.

USSA is divided into over 15 differ-
ent caucuses to address student needs, and
range from the People of African Descent
Coalition to the National Women’s
Student Coalition, among others.

However, Keith Campbell,
Legislative Director of the GRC, said that
the eight students going to the conference
may choose whichever caucus they iden-
tify with.

“The students pick the caucuses
themselves when they register,” Campbell
said. “The caucuses discuss campus issues
and legislative issues facing that particular
population.”

Campbell could not rule out the pos-
sibility that two Pitt students could be in
the same caucus.

Students are also concerned that the
$40 activities fee they are required to pay
each semester isn’t being spent on some-
thing that will directly beneﬁt Pitt’s carn-
pus and its students.

Allocations Chair Noelle Carnpagna
said that the GRC had originally asked for
funding for 10 students to attend the con-
ference, but allocations had denied that

Though some claim the lobby effort
that Pitt leaders will attend this weekend
has become a junket, the association has
50 years of student-politics history behind
it.

y The organization, called the United
States Student Association, is a national
group that claims to ﬁght nationwide for
student beneﬁts like ﬁnancial aid and
public safety.

However, they also lobby for pro-
grams such as affirmative action and wel-
fare status, which some students say gives
the organization a political slant that

 

many don’t agree with.

“Well, we try to find common
ground,” said student—govemment repre-
sentative Keith Campbell.

Though the group does not always
ﬁnd common ground among its con-
stituents, it also tries to teach leadership
skills.

The USSA is the largest and oldest
student association, founded in 1947, and
members from different delegations
around the country come together annual-
ly in Washington, D.C.

“USSA trains student leaders how to
work with the students better, and teaches
us how to get involved and motivate,”

Rape statistics can mislead,
drive some people to extremes

“Anne Estonilo

The gaping first floor window
welcomed his entrance and secured
his escape. It was blistering hot the
night he crept into her room.

She awoke in the dark to find him
standing above her bed, knife in one
hand and a pillow he would push into
her face in the other hand. He threat-
ened to kill her if she made any
noise.

As she stifled her screams, he
ravished her just as he did the women
before her and the woman who would
follow. The date on the top left hand
corner of her police report read 1991.

Six years later, rape in America is
on the decline, according to the
Bureau of Justice Statistics. But there
are still victims, and 1.3 rapes occur
every minute. That’s 78 people raped
each hour.

But how safe you are isn’t neces-

 

sarily dictated by these statistics.
Many people are misled by statistics
and driven to the extremes. Either
they don’t take precautions to protect
themselves, or they live in fear of
being assaulted.

“I don’t like statistics that say
‘every two minutes someone is
raped’ because they’re misleading,”
said Officer Ashley Thompson of the
Zone 6 police department. “There
could be 10 rapes in a day and none
in a week that can make the num-
bers.”

In 1996, the American Medical
Association estimated two-thirds of
sexual attacks go unreported, making
it the most underreported crime in
the United States.

The victims are not just women.
They are men and children, neigh-
bors, co-workers, sisters and broth-
ers, or yourself.

Holocaust survivors sue insurance
companies for $7 billion

Around the World

Nablus, West Bank,_ Israel — Hospital oili-
cials in the West Bank say an unarmed
Palestinian policeman died after Israeli
troops opened ﬁre on protestors yesterday.

The shooting came after the Israelis
could not subdue. 1,000 stone-throwing pro-
testors with tear gas and rubber bullets.

Yesterday, two Palestinians were killed
and ﬁve wounded near Jewish settlements in
the Gaza Strip. Israel says both of the dead
were suicide bombers who may have blown
up schoolbuses carrying Jewish children.

Palestinian police blame one of the
blasts on Israeli troops who they say threw
explosives at a passing taxi and a donkey
cart. .

Across the Nation

New York -— Holocaust survivors and their
heirs are suing European insurance compa-
nies for $7 billion.

In a class-action lawsuit ﬁled in New
York this week, a dozen plaintiffs alleged that
some of companies allowed the Nazis to cash
in some policies.

The suit said insurance companies say
they cannot pay claims because policies can-
not be found, or they were canceled because
policyholders stopped paying premiums. All

of the policies were sold during or before
World War H. ~-

major role in state lawsuits that resulted in the
recent settlement with Liggett. ‘'
Internal papers from the 1960s and.
1970s also reportedly show that the tobacco
industry manipulated nicotine levels in ciga-
rettes, and targeted teenagers and racial
minorities. A
Most of the papers being turned over by

request.

“We approved funding for ﬁve stu-
dents to attend, and sent the request back to
the GRC because we needed more infor-
mation and had questions on why they felt
they needed 10 students,” Campagna said.
“They were not able to justify their original
request, and didn’t supply enough reasons
on why they needed 10 people to go.”

Campagna said the decision then went
to the SGB members, who compromised
and approved funding for three additional
students.

Board member Christa Douaihy said
she voted for the extra students to increase
Pitt’s political pull on legislators.

“At conferences like USSA, the dele-
gations who get the most attention from the
legislators to change things are the ones
who are the largest,” she said. “Agitation
gets results.”

Board member Brandi Miller voted
against sending the extra students.

“I think that ﬁve students was suffi-
cient enough to represent Pitt on a national
level. I didn’t see the necessity to send extra
students,” she said.

Miller said that her vote may have
been different if the board had known who
the extra students would have been in
advance.

“The Governmental . Relations

Committee [did not currently have] the

 

 

.55; mom mes r 

three extra people. I would have liked to
know who they were,” she said. “I [didn’t]
know if those who [were] going to be
selected for the conference will be effec-
tive. I could justify better going with three
if I knew the candidates, when I think that
ﬁve people would do just ﬁne.”

Campagna agreed. She said that allo-
cations can justify spending a lot of money
if a lot of students will beneﬁt, but she isn’t
sure if that is the case. _

“Sending ﬁve people to one confer-
ence is a lot, and there is only so much that
a few individuals can bring back to cam-
pus,” Carnpagna said. “['The GRC] never
really answered the question of what Pitt
and its students are truly getting out of this
conference.”

Pitt joined USSA in 1995, and seven
Pitt students first attended a USSA legisla-
tive conference like this one last spring.

Beneﬁts. What beneﬁts? ‘

Campbell and Neary said that several
things came back to our campus through
last year’s conference. ,

One of the conference strategy work-
shops focused on the Grass Roots strategy,
which emphasizes the basics of how to get
students involved in organizations on carn-
pus. When last year’s delegation returned‘,
they decided to set up the Grass Roots

wrought with sexual assaults in
South Oakland. Antoine Hamilton
was only sixteen, but his appetite for
sexual violence consumed him.

The Pittsburgh Press reported
that three rapes had occurred within
weeks of each other. All of the
women returned home after midnight
the nights they were raped, and
police suspected a stalker.
Investigators said the rapist probably
watched the apartments for several
hours to make sure the victims were
alone before entering. He slipped
into open windows while the women
slept.

Data shows that all sexes, ages,
and races are vulnerable to rape. But
not all are equally vulnerable.
According to one study done in 1979,
college students were particularly
susceptible. The Center for Victims
of Violent Crime agreed.

Their fact sheet shows that
women most often raped are between
the ages of 16 and 24 years. This is
partly due to their ages and because
these women are starting to date. The
highest rate of rape occurs for girls
from 16 to 19 year-old age groups,
with the next highest rate occurring
between 20 and 24—year—olds.

But once more, the problem of
overlooking other age‘groups and
males vulnerable to rape arises. Dr.
Linda Ledray, the founder and direc-
tor of the Minneapolis Sexual
Assault Resource Service, addresses
the issue of rape myths in her book
“Recovering from Rape.”

T Ledray writes that rape myths are
created by society to comfort fears.
She says they serve to convince us

that we can prevent rape and that ~.

live in a “just world.”

But Ledray describes the brutal
rape of a girl and her boyfriend one
night after three men approached
them on their way to the car.

' “Rape myths allow people to feel
safe by letting them believe that rape
rarely happens, and when it does, it is
because the woman secretly wanted
to be raped,” she writes.

The rape of the girlfriend and the

   FROM PAGE I 

boyfriend dispels much of the stereo-
type that often surrounds rape.
Some picture a typical rapist to

» jump out of a dark alley only on-a

night a girl is walking home alone. In
Ledray’s case study, there were two
people innocently walking to their
car after a movie one night when the
rapists appeared. There isn’t always
safety in numbers, and rapists aren’t
raping because they are driven by
lust or sexual desire, says Ledray.

These myths provide a false
sense of security, and they affect all
areas of crime, not just sexual
assault.

Last year there were "1772 thefts
in Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill,
Point Breeze, and Schenely Park —
areas patrolled by Zone 6. According
to Officer Carole Buckley, this does-
n’t always include unreported thefts
or university campus statistics like
those of Pitt or Carnegie Mellon
University.

“In Oakland, you have higher
crime and more thefts because there
are a lot more people,” said Buckley.
“Oakland’s biggest problem would
be like auto thefts.”

Still, losing a car may be prefer-
able to bodily harm. Consider that
there were 143 accounts of aggravat-
ed assault in 1996. Picture someone
running up to you at a bus stop and
slashing your face with a knife, only
to turn and run the other way. They
didn’t take your wallet or snatch your
watch; they only wanted to hurt you.

It happened on Morewood
Avenue one afternoon a few years
back, according to police reports. In
working to help dispel the myths that
surround crime, the month of April
has been set aside as Sexual Abuse
Awareness month.

Yesterday marked the first annual
Sexual Abuse Awareness month.
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape said
in its press release that it is a time set
aside for communities to “collective-
ly denounce sexual violence.”

A major part of prevention is
awareness, both on community and
individual levels.

Organizing Weekend on campus.

“Last October, GROW brought
together about 40 student leaders from 15
to 20 student organizations for a weekend
of lectures, discussions, role playing, and
working together to find out how to reach
the students better,” Neary said.

Although the weekend saw many
campus leaders, Neary said that it was open
to the entire student body.

This past year, the GRC held a voter
registration campaign under the direction
of USSA to get as many students on carn-
pus registered for the presidential elections.
Also, Neary and Campbell said that a large
part of Student Government Board issues
get help from other USSA colleges and uni-
versities across the country.

THE PI'l"l' NEWS

“When the Student Government
Board wanted to get a position of shared
governance on the Board of Trustees, we
consulted with other schools who had the
same experience,” Campbell said. “When
the SGB wanted to close Bigelow
Boulevard, we contacted other schools who
had closed down roads to unify their cam-
puses.”

Neary added that USSA is an endless
supply of information on campus and is a
constant access to Washington.

“USSA is based on theories, contacts,

I and information,” he said.

When asked if there would be more
beneﬁts brought back to the strident body
from the conference this year, both Neary
and Campbell felt strongly that there would

 

be.

“This is only our second official year
of attending [the conference],” Neary said.
“Last year’s pool of students [who attend-
ed] were not as strong as they could have
been.” .
But the dwindling strength and effort
of those previous years makes many won-
der why Pitt continues to participate in the
conference.

Carnpagna said that in the years before
USSA was here at Pitt, GRC brought a lot
of speakers to campus and had luncheons
where they shared concerns and ideas
directly with the student body.

“It used to be a big event,” she said.
“The state legislators used to come to Pitt
for lunch, and everyone would talk about

Wednesday, April 2, ‘I 997

political issues and what the carnpus’s con-
cerns were. It wasn’t until recently when
we joined USSA that the Govemmental
Relations Committee started to go to
Washington and other places to speak to
legislators.” I
When asked if the student body would
better beneﬁt from legislators coming here
to campus, Campbell said that if elected
officials came, there would be restrictions
on what they could do. 9
‘‘It’s something we can look into,”
Campbell said. “We should definitely start
trying to [bring legislators here].”
_Whether they will use this weekend’s
conference to begin bringing national and
state leaders back for the rest of Pitt’s stu-
dent body has yet to be seen.

History 

Governmental Relations Committee Chair
Adam Neary said.

USSA was founded by students who
thought that they needed a new American"
student union, because the several previ-
ously existing student unions were dis-
banded during World War 11.

Five hundred students from across the
country attended a plamiing meeting in
Chicago in December 1947, and the first
Congress of the United States National
Student Association, the USSA’s parent
organization, was held at the University of
VVisconsin the following summer.

The NSA also ofﬁcially opposed seg-

’ regation that year, when they elected Ted

Harris, a black student from Pennsylvania,
as the organization’s president.

In the 1950s, the NSA’s focus was on
tasks like supporting student governments
and encouraging student activism. In 1951,
the N SA condemned McCarthyism, and in

1953 condemned apartheid for preventing ._

access to higher education.

In the 1960s, the NSA adopted the
Vietnam War as a central issue, and it
opposed sending troops overseas. In the
70s, the NSA’s annual meeting featured
workshops on gay rights, and it elected its
first female president.

But in 1971, a group of Califomia stu-
dents who were dissatisﬁed over the NSA’s
position on the Vietnam War broke away
to form the National Student Lobby, say-
ing the group had lost students as its focus.

In 1974, the NSA formed a separate
nonpolitical foundation, which enabled the
organization to become more active in lob-
bying and eased tensions between the two
groups. In 1978, the two groups merged
again and dubbed themselves the USSA.

But the group’s activities have dwin-
dled in recent years, and some wonder if it
has degenerated into a training ground for
bureaucrats.

“I would not have gotten involved in
student government if it were not for
USSA,” said Student Government Board
member Christa Douaihy, who attended
the conference last year. . r

USSA” trip is an unfair usage of our Student Activities Fees

lltﬂvliws

The SGB’s Governmental
Relations Committee got its
Christmas wish a little early this
year and will send eight people
to the USSA conference in
Washington, D.C.

A total of $3,600 of our stu-
dent activities fees will be used
to fund this field trip for SGB
affiliates and Black Action
Society leaders. Isn’t that
grand? Especially when you fig-
ure how it was touted that appli-
cations for the three spots that
were granted over the original
five delegates would be accept-
ed from students throughout the

 

University to give the student
body a varied representation.
However, that is not the

case. Although GRC Chair
Adam‘Neary received 12 appli-
cations for the positions, it was
decided that six of the people
going to the conference are
affiliated with SGB, and the

other two are from the BAS. No ‘

offense, guys, but that doesn’t
sound likea very diverse group
of people representing the
University of Pittsburgh.

The GRC never gave stu-
dents a fair chance in submit-
ting applications to go on the
trip.

Instead, they are paying for
people who are already in the
organization to go to their con-
ference. Our 40 bucks are going
to pay someone else’s dues and
tabs.

The applications were post-
ed oh the Friday before spring
break and due on the Friday
after spring break. Most stu-

dents were already gone when it
was first posted, and were
recovering from their sunburn
on the due date. .

The search for applicants to
go on the trip was poorly adver-
tised. There were no_ posters,
ﬂiers, or tables around campus
to getthe word out to students.
No wonder barely
applied.

Sorry to say this folks, but
this trip looks like just another
example of the powers that be at
SGB misappropriating our stu-
dent activities fees for their own
benefit. 0

 

 

Cults aren't the answers to our problems

 

Of all the things that ever hap-
pen to you or me when we leave

this University, I hope that none of .

us are ever found dead in a mass
suicide with $5.00 and some
change in the pockets of our identi-
cal slacks. If nothing else, I exhort
you to keep a cynic’s eye open for
the charismatic and ruthless, and I
hope that the blatantly insane and
dangerous will be immediately
apparent to you. Intelligence and
education are not universal

’ panaceas against making stupid
mistakes, but often maintaining
one’s sense of humor is.

Ever since America won its
independence from Britain, the
British have watched the building

- of this unique new “nation under
God” with a mixture of envy, dis-
dain, admiration, and amusement.
British humor is well known for its
own brand of satire and surrealism,
and certain aspects of American
culture certainly do seem to lend
themselves rather well to it.

For example, last month’s‘

copy of the British satiric magazine
Viz featured under its “Only in
America” section a headline
“story” featuring “Wacko Jacko”
(Michael Jackson) in his “unsuc-
cessful bid to buy a stone bridge in
Scotland in order to become a troll
and sit under it waiting for the
chance to leap out and scare
passersby.” Further “reports” in this
section detailed the “first lawsuit in
which a California woman has suc-
cessfully sued her infant for shitting
in its nappy and causing her
extreme olfactory distress.”
However, some stories from
American life don’t need to be sat-
irized in order to further the cause
of arnusement/arnazement value.

Some stories from American life
are already satirical in their raw,
nonﬁction fonn, like the one in the
Post—Gazette on Monday detailing
the “logic” behind the mass suicide
of 39 people in Mountainair, Calif.

Seeing the headline “Ex-cultist
lost wife, sorry he missed suicide,”
the reaction of a cynic might be to
mutter “Well, what’s stopping you
now?” However, then the ex—cultist
wouldn’t be here to increase our
understanding of the situation. This
ex—cultist, one Mr. Cooke of
Sausalito, Calif., told a radio station
that he believed the dead people
were now all on a spaceship some-
where, having “shed their contain-
ers” and evolved to a higher level,
which included moving into “phys-
ical bodies of a ﬁner nature ——
androgynous, sexless.” Now, why
didn’t I think of that?

I suppose this all makes sense
to_ the Heaven’s .Gate cultists.
According to Cooke, he still sup-
ports the cult’s beliefs of shunning
alcohol, sex, and earthly posses-
sions. Well, it’s not particularly
original, but this is a bit unfortunate
for some of the “earthly posses-
sions” — like their children.
Abandoning one’s children to fol-
low the cult was standard practice
for its members.

Cooke and his wife abandoned
their daughter, Kelly, 20 years ago.
But this same daughter is quoted in
the Post-Gazette as saying that she
“accepted her mother’s death” but
felt that “suicide” was too strong a
word to use for something her
mother had “worked for all her
life.” Even though Kelly wasn’t in
the cult, it seems she has learned
her lessons well, although this
remark does remind me of that
attributed to Brooke Shields in a
collection of the world’s dumbest
quotations. Brooke says that “when

nw¢i..»r.;~t...z~t..vv4xu I

you die, you lose an important part
of your life.” Right on, Brooke.
Why don’t you start a religion?

Anyway, what about this mys-
terious $5.00 and some change?
According to Cooke, the cult was
“very practical.”

“We might need it for using .

the telephone, or if the car broke
down or we needed ataxi.” OK,
that’s sounding fairly practical. But
why would you need it after “shed-
ding your container” and boarding
a spaceship? It seems that the
members of the Heaven’s Gate cult
were very keen to stay within their
budgets at all times. It seems that
even while traveling between dif-
ferent star systems, they were anx-
ious to maintain budgetary limits. It
seems that even after shedding
your container, moving up to a
higher level of spaceship, and
assuming a new, androgynous and
sexless body; you would still be
wearing the same pants“. I guess
that you can transcend your body,
but you’ll never escape the little
green god.

Another (abandoned) daughter
of a dead cultist told The New York
Times that she was not too sur-
prised by her father’s defection
from the family 17 years previous-
ly. She had felt that he was dissatis-
ﬁed with his life (money worries,
relationship problems, you know
the deal) and “searching for some-
thing.”

Maybe a sense of humor? A
sense of the ridiculous? Common
sense? Everybody has money wor-
ries and ‘relationship problems.
Joining some wacky cult is no
answer. Even in America.

p. r. taylor cannot see the point in an
androgynous, sexless, alcohol—free
existence. The British are more
sensible about these things.

Thank you,

The Ku Klux Klan is set to march in

Pittsburgh this weekend.

As a sportswriter, this isn’t my business.
It’s tough enough to avoid controversy when
you stick to games. Ask Bob “When’s Spring
Break?” Srnizik.

But as a Caucasian—American sports fan,
I feel there’s one statement that has to come
out before everybody and their ethics profes-
sors starts talking about racism:

Jackie Robinson, we owe you big.

The 1997 season marks the golden
anniversary of integrated baseball. Robinson
made that possible. Had his mission failed,
baseball might have remained an all—white
sport well into the 1950s. Or later.

The Dodger hall-of—famer took more
racial insults than the Klan could hope to
spread come Saturday. He began his career
faced with a petition from major league base-
ball players stating that they would not take
the ﬁeld if he was on the roster.

Those were his teammates. His play
converted them ﬁrst.

When the 1947 season started, the St.
Louis Cardinals threatened to boycott games
against Brooklyn if Robinson played. Jackie
had things thrown at him and was knocked
over repeatedly.‘ Branch Rickey, the front-
ofﬁce muscle behind Robinson, invented the
batting helmet so his player wouldn’t get
killed.
2 For three years, under Rickey’s orders,
Robinson didn’t say a word or throw a
punch. He couldn’t afford it — one scuﬁle or
one off—color remark would result in outright
release. Some estimate that baseball would -
have needed ﬁve years to try integration
again. I

But he lasted. His play wasn’t sloppy.

He was articulate. He wasn’t reckless on the »

basepaths — just fast. He broke down every
major stereotype white baseball had hung on
black players.

Well, except that they couldn’t pitch.

I THE PITT NEWS

Wednesday, April 2, ‘I997

 

Junior right-hander Chris Gallick pitched seven innings for the Panlhersyesterday but finished with the loss.

Mountaineer train rolls though Panthers

 

 

 

Going into yesterday’s game against

West Virginia (17-8, 6-0 B.E.), the Pitt’

baseball tearri (14-9,4-4 B.E.) was conﬁ-
dent that they could hand the
Mountaineers their first Big East loss this
season.

When the ﬁnal out of the
Mountaineers’ 9-0 win was recorded, the
Panthers were asking for the name of the
freight train that ripped through their line-
up.

The name of the train was Chris
Enochs, a hard—throwing righty who kept
the Panthers guessing all day. Pitt could
only muster a single in the second inning
and one hit in each of the last six innings.
The Panthers never got a runner past sec-
ond base.

Scott Lobaugh and Sam Crowley
were the only Pitt players to have a multi-

hit game. Crowley went two for four, with
singles in the fourth and sixth innings.
Lobaugh was the only Panther who
seemed to have Enochs ﬁgured out. He
was three for four, with two singles and
the only extra-base hit for Pitt, a ninth-
inning double. Rob Garvey and Chris
Delsignore were the only other Panthers
to hit safely. Each player had a single.

Chris Gallick was saddled with the
loss for Pitt, despite throwing seven solid
innings. He gave up four earned runs on
six hits and two walks while striking out
two. Freshman Jory Coughenour served
in the mop-up role, throwing the last two
innings. He surrendered three earned runs
on three hits and two walks.

The Panthers hope to get back on the
winning track today at Kent State before
getting back in the thick of their Big East
schedule with a pair of double-headers
this weekend against Seton Hall and
Rutgers.

ott Lough went 3-4 in the loss.

The last month of the season is critical in
every sport. Teams always talk about the need
to “gain momentum heading down the
stretc ” and “pick it up going into the play-
offs.” For the Pitt women’s tennis team, April
is the most crucial month, and the Panthers
started it off with a 7-2 win at CMU yester-
day.

“Our team played really well,” said
senior Tamara Kalesnik. “Everyone stepped
up to the occasion and won the matches they
needed to win.”

Pitt won ﬁve singles matches and two
doubles matches, as it picked up its 14th win
of the season, tying the mark it set last year.

“We’re pacing ourselves quite nicely,”
said Kalesnik, who beat Whitney Brooks 6-0,
6-1. “We’re working hard in practice, we’re
ﬁtter, and all of the hard work is paying off.”

Amanda Hoffman and Beth Gang both

       

won their team—leading 17th match of thesea-
son. Hoffman defeated Jillian Watkins 6-4, 6-
3, and Gang defeated Michele Cook 6-4, 6-1.

“Amanda kept her composure and hit
her ground—strokes we ,” said Head Coach
George Dieﬂenbach.

Alison Bucher beat Julie Balch 6-2, 6-2
for her ninth win, and Jen Bible improved her
record to 1-1 with her win overAnika Arriin.

Erin Shalbrack was bumped up from her
no.2seedtotheno. 1 seedinplaoeofFran
Davis, who left the match to attend a late
afternoon class. As Pitt’s top seed, Shalbrack
faced CMU’s Keri Mills, the no. 2—ranked
tennis player in Division III.

“She’s the best player in Western
Pennsylvania and one of the best players in
the state,” said Dieffenbach.

Shalbrack lost 6-2, 6-0, but she wasn’t
on top of her game.

“It was a really off day for me. I don’t
think I was as mentally tough as I should have
been,” she said after her 9-7 doubles loss with

Davis against Mills and Watkins.

In other doubles action, the Kalesnik-
Bucher tandem recorded its 11th victory by
defeating Brooks and Balch 8-6. Hoffman
and Bible defeated Arnin and Fedorowich 8-
2 to record their third doubles win this season.

“Jen and I came off to a slow start, but
we picked up our game and got the job done,”
said Hoffman.

The entire team has been getting the job
done recently. The Panthers are on a ﬁve-
match winning streak. ‘

“We’re picking it up when we need to.
but we’re going to have to take it to another
level for the Big East,” said Kalesnik. “Right
now, we’re right where we should be heading
into the dual match with West Virginia and
Georgetown.”

On Friday, Pitt will host Dayton at 3 p.m.
at CMU, weather permitting.

“It’s going to be a real test,” said
Dieffenbach. “It’ll be a good match for our
team to progress even further.”

CENTRAL DIVISION

hioago White Sox

While the White Sox have been
something of a disappointment the
past two seasons even with a fairly
high talent level and payroll, General
Manager Jerry Reinsdorf kept the
ball rolling. Now, the roster is at the
point where anything less than a deep
progression into the playoffs will be

onsidered a disaster.

Chicago succeeded in landing the

most—prized, if not the most-despised,

 free agent this ofr”-season by making

THE PITT NEWS

Albert Belle the highest—paid player in
history. The one—two punch that was
created in the process with Belle and
Frank Thomas should be a fearsome
sight for opposing pitchers, and the rest
of the White Sox batting order doesn’t
get much easier with the likes of Robin
Ventura, Harold Baines, and Tony
Phillips hitting around the twin terrors.

The only obstacle that is keeping
Chicago from being fully conﬁdent in
their World Series chances is their
starting pitching. Wilson Alvarez is
solid as the No. 1 starter, but free
agents Jaime Navarro and Doug
Drabek must re—prove their worth and
keep the balls in the inﬁeld (where
Ventura and Ozzie Guillen provide

ample defense), in order for the White
Sox to take a shot at the pennant.
Predicted ﬁnish: lst, A.L. Central

Cleveland Indians

For most of the olf—season, the
Indians remained fairly stagnant as far
as roster changes. They lost Albert
Belle to the White Sox, which was
pretty much expected, and they picked
Matt Wﬂliarns from the Giants. Then
this past week, the bomb dropped —
Cleveland traded away Kenny Lofton
to the Braves for David Justice and
Marquis Grissom. As of now, it’s too
early to tell how the blockbuster trade
will alfect the Indians, not just on the
ﬁeld, but in the clubhouse as well.

7

Belle tolls for the Pale Sox in Central and Junior out West

Cleveland is still as loaded as they
ever been. Charles Nagy, Orel
Hershiser, and Jack McDowell anchor
the pitching staﬂ°, Jose Mesa is ready as
the stopper, and the lineup includes
Manny Ramirez, Jim Thome, Julio
Franco, and Kevin Seitzer along with
the new acquisitions. However, the
White Sox appeared to have caught up
to Cleveland before the trade, and until
further notice, the verdict is still out.

- Former Altoona and Shaler star
Danny Fortson announced that he
will forego his senior season at
Cincinnati and head to the NBA. The
back—to-back Conference USA
Player of the Year averaged 21.4
points and nine rebounds per game
last season for the 26-8 Bearcats.

As a sophomore, Fortson aver-
aged 20.1 points and 9.6 rebounds.
As a freshman, he took the country
by storm with his 15.1 points and 7.6
rebounds per contest.

“It’s basically a business deci-
sion. I’ve thought about working on
my dream. My dream is to play in the
NBA, and I think I can play. There’s
no doubt in my mind. I’m ready.”

- Temple center Mark Jackson
announced, with head coach John
Chaney’s blessing, that he will also
bypass his senior season and skip to
the NBA. Scouts have reported that
Jackson is a second—round pick at
best.

- Arkansas guard Kareem Reid
was charged with two misdemeanor
counts related to traffic violations.
The SEC assist leader last season,
who helped the Hogs to an 18-14
record, also faces charges related to
his failure to answer a court sum-

Daly, 30, reportedly arrived at
“Sloppy Joe’s” in Jacksonville

midnight.

Daly was taken to a local hospi-

from a few losing years to ﬁnish third in the
Central.

Minnesota appears headed further along
their upward trend, signing free agents Teny
Steinbach, Bob Tewksbuiy, Greg Swindell,
and Gregg Olson.

Tewksbury’s signing especially helps,
adding stability to a rotation that would otli—
erwise be considered thin with Rick Aguilera
being the only other proven starter.

The Twins’ batting order looks solid,
with Chuck Knoblauch, Paul Molitor, Marty
Cordova, and Roberto Kelly hitting around
the newly—acquiied Steinbach.

Unfortunately for Minnesota, they are
playing in a division that includes powerful
Chicago and Cleveland, so while another
winning ‘season looks probable, any hopes
for a postseason appearance might have to
hold off another year.

Predicted ﬁnish: 3rd, A.L. Central

Kansas City Royals

_ Kansas City has been going through
something of a youth movement the past
few years, taking the time to develop
younger players from within in order to build
for the future.

This past week, the Royals couldn’t
resist standing still any longer, trading away
the promising Michael Tucker and Keith
Lockhart to the Braves for Jermaine Dye and
pitcher Jaime Walker. ’

While the youth trend has not been broken,
it remains to be seen how these new acquisi-
tions will ﬁt in.

The pitching staff is basically the same_

with Kevin Appier and Tim Belcher leading
the starters, and closer Jeff Montgomery
looks toberetumingintime from otf—season
shoulder surgery. Free agent signee Chili
Davis, along with Jeff King and Jay Bell
(acquired via trade from Pittsburgh), add
punch to an otherwise low-wattage lineup
If all goes right, the Royals could ﬁnish

higher than expected, but for now the rest of
the division just looks too tough.
Predicted Finish: 4th, A.L. Central

Milwaukee Brewers

Is there any man on earth who is more
hated by baseball fans than Brewers owner
Bud Selig? Probably not, which is why most
people outside of Milwaukee won’t feel
sorry for the Brewers this July, who by that
time should be ﬁrmly entrenched in last
place in the strong AL Central. .

The pitching staff is respectable with
Ben McDonald and Cal Eldred penciled in
as starters and Doug Jones in the bullpen, but
the batter order just doesn’t seem to have
enough ﬁrepower to enable Milwaukee to
win with any kind of consistency.

Brewers fans should have fun looking
forward to the construction their new stadi-
um, Miller Park, but that’s about all they’ll
be able to talk about this summer, except the
losses.

Predicted ﬁnish: Stli, A.L. Central

WESTERN DIVISION

Seattle Mariners ,

The Mariners look to have one of the
elite teams in the American League, if not
all of baseball, this year.

Although Seattle pretty much stayed
away from making any major roster
moves in the oﬂ°—season, they had pretty
good reason for doing so. The Mariners, if
they stay healthy, should possess one of
the most feared lineups in the majors. The
batting order that contains studs Ken
Giiffey Jr., Jay Buhner, Edgar Martinez,
and Alex Rodriguez should wreak havoc
on American League pitching throughout
the summer. 0

The question mark comes with their
pitching, in particular ace Randy Johnson.
Although the rotation rounds out with J eﬁ

 

Fassero (acquired from Montreal), Jamie
Moyer, and Scott Sanders, Seattle needs
Johnson to return to his old form follow-
ing back surgery in order for them to
entertain any hopes of the World Series
championship. Otherwise, while Seattle

will still win in the weaker AL West, they .

can count on an early playoff exit.
Predicted ﬁnish: lst, A.L. West

Texas Rangers

The Rangers went away from a trend
that they have followed fairly consistently
in their history: they signed a major free
agent, closer and World Series MVP John
Wetteland from the Yankees. L

This makes sense, considering how
well Wetteland closed out the Rangers in
the ﬁrst round of last year’s playoffs.
Texas is hoping for a different outcome
this year, and they should get one, just not
the way that they hope. '

The Rangers’ lineup still has tremen-
dous potential with Juan Gonzalez, Will
Clark, Mickey Tettleton, Dean Palmer,
and Ivan Rodriguez. The rotation looks
solid as well, with Ken Hill, John Burkett,
and Roger Pavlik leading the starters.

However, with Seattle in their divi-
sion, the Rangers probably won’t get the
chance to atone for letting their playoff
series with the Yankees slip away.
Predicted ﬁnish: 2nd, A.L. West

Anaheim Angels

Everything about the Angels seems to
different this season. They have a new
name with a new logo and new uniforms,
and they’re playing in a new stadium.
They also have some new players.
New editions Eddie Murray, Dave
Hollins, Mark Gubicza, and Jim Leyritz
should add some veteran leadership to a
team that was sorely lacking in that depart-

ment last season. Combine Murray,‘

 
 
 
 

§

 FROM PAGE 7 . .

Hollins, and Leyritz to a lineup that
includes Tim Salmon, Jim Edmonds, and
Garrett Anderson, and Angels are capable
of serious offensive
Anaheirn’s starting pitching is still a little
thin, with Chuck Finley and Mark
Langston being the closest thing to relia-
bility. Troy Percival is a huge presence in
the bullpen, but with weak starters, he may
not get a lot a chances to show his stuff.
If the rotation comes around, look for
Anaheim to ﬁnish higher than expected.
Predicted ﬁnish: 3rd, A._L. West

Oaldand Athletics ,

About ten years ago, Oakland slug-
gers Jose Canseco and Mark McGuire
were just beginning the Bash Brothers
Era, which would produce three AL pen-
nats and one World Series title before it
was broken up. Now, Canseco and
McGuire have been reunited, but the
effect will undoubtedly not be the same.
While McGuire is slugging home runs at a
record pace, Canseco is a shadow of his
former self.

Other than the aforementioned Bash
Brothers, there’s not much to talk about in

Oakland. The roster is filled with young, ,

and sometimes marginal, major league tal-
ent. Scott Brosius and Geronimo Berroa
looks promising in terms of offense, but
the pitchers are relatively anonymous and
don’t look capable of holding opposing
teams below four or ﬁve runs per game
with any kind of consistency.

Art Howe will have to do the manag-
ing job of his life to keep this team from
ﬁnishing in last place.

Satchel Paige would handle that in 1948,
despite being in his late forties.

By 1950, blacks in baseball were few,
but established. In the years that followed,
players like Roy Campanella and Hank
Aaron broke records. Wﬂlie Mays broke
whole record books. Paige set longevity
records that would make Nolan Ryan wince.

If Robinson hadn’t succeeded, none of
that would have happened. It would have
been conﬁned to the Negro Leagues, and
white America would have missed all of it.

Black or white, we owe Robinson for
that history.

And, we owe him for the wake-up call
he sent our parents, our grandparents, and
our sports heroes. Not everybody was con-
vinced — the guys in the white hoods on
Saturday are good examples — but some
had their value structures shaken by
Robinson’s stellar play.

Phillies centerﬁelder Rich Ashbum is
the most outspoken of the latter group. He
admits to harboring deep reservations about
integration. He admits that he saw the oper-
ation as doomed from the beginning. He
admits to a lot of feelings that his fans don’t
want to believe he had.

But, he’s changed. Robinson’s perfor-
mance changed him, like it changed many
others. While baseball’s record on race rela-
tions has been far from perfect since the
breakthrough, it has improved dramatically.

Take a quick glimpse at the major story-
lines for the golden anniversary of integra-
tion:

 

Wednesday, April 2, 1997

FROM PAGE 6 

-Will Barry Bonds live up to his contract
extension?

-Can Ken Griffey, Jr. lead the Mariners .

to the promised land?

-How will Albert Belle and Frank H

Thomas complement each other in Chicago?

-What will the Kenny Lofton—David
Justice trade do for the Braves and Indians?

-How many more records will Eddie
Murray break? _

°Can Cecil Fielder survive a whole year
of New York media pressure?

Interesting subplots involving the
sport’s greatest players. All black, by the
way.

Would they be here without Robinson’s
effort? Probably. Mays or Aaron or Paige
would have eventually left a pennant-hungry
franchise in a progressive market no choice
but to sign them. That isn’t the point.

What’s important is that someone had to
do it. Somebody needed to go first.
Somebody needed to open the door for his
contemporaries and for future generations
that would become national heroes, villains,
and legends, not just black baseball players.

So when the ethics professor asks you
about race relations, don’t limit yourself to a
few guys under hoods marching downtown.
Talk about Willie Stargell. Talk about Al
Martin. If you’re a real Pittsburgh sports fan,
talk about Paige or Josh Gibson.

Talk about Jackie Robinson. Everyone
should hear the story.

Kevin Lilley is the Assistant Sports Editor of
The Pitt News.
