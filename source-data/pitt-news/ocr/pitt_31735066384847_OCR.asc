Pitt to Enter Fall Term With

Appropriations Question Answered

ByTOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

With the recent signing of the
“non-preferred status” budget by
Governor Shapp, Pitt will not face
the nightmarish delay of state
appropriations that hung over
Harrisburg last summer and fall.

The $63.1 million approved by
Shapp constitutes a‘four percent
increase in Pitt aid—the first
increase in more than three years.

A review of last year’s events at
Pitt centers mainly on economic
issues. Budget hassles from
Harrisburg caused Pitt to enter the
fall term with no state appropria-
tions, and while legislators argued,
Pitt was forced to borrow as much as
$2,500 a day to compensate for the
lack of funds.

Some 3,000 students from Pitt,
Penn State, Lincoln and Temple
rallied in Harrisburg in October to
argue for immediate passage of
funding for state related schools.
The legislators finally came through
in December with $62 million for
Pitt, but not before cutbacks in
services were initiated. The Uni-
versity is still paying interest
charges on money borrowed during
the fall term.

the result was another tuition
increase for Pitt students—this one
a $50 raise. At the annual Trustees
meeting last May on the Johnstown
campus an additional $25 was
tacked on to that ﬁgure.

With the budget - problems I

temporarily ceased last winter,
another economic problem caused
additional cutbacks at Pitt. The
three-month-old coal strike forced
the Public Utility Commission to
order electrical cutbacks of 25
percent in mid-February. Pitt
complied with an overall shutdown
of all University buildings——inclu'd-
ing Hillman Library at 10 p.m.-
just in time for mid-terms.

As the coal strike was winding
down, psychiatric assistants,
clerks, business and maintenance
workers at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (WPIC) em-
barked on a two-month strike of
their own.

At one point, strike sympathizers
seized control of Chancellor Pos-

\ var’s office and held it throughout

the day. When Posvar attended a
Senate Council meeting later in the
day, the sympathizers physically
restrained him from leaving the
40th floor of the Cathedral,
reminiscent of the sit-ins of the
1960’s. Fortunately no one was

Schulman said he is interested in
improving the quality of teaching
within the College, an area
Marshall considered most impor-
tant.

“My first clientel and interest are
the students,” Schulman said.

Curriculum reform is another
matter he considered important.

“The B.S. degree should signify
that a student has learned certain
things,” said Schulman, who wants

. to ‘ ‘put teeth into the distribution of

studies requirement. ”

injured, and the strike ended at the
start of May.

Resignations within the Univer-
sity caught the interest of the Pitt
community last year. College of

Arts and Sciences (CAS) dean

Robert Marshall resigned his post
last January, saying he was not
pleased by recent national trends
toward research development
rather than educational priorities.
Father Ivan Dornic of the slavic
department and Curtissi Porter,
chairman of the black studies
department, made news with their
“resignations in protest” last fall.
Dornic charged Pitt officials were
prejudiced toward the hiring of
teachers of slavic descent. He
claimed that officials as high as the
Chancellor were guilty of this

I charge.

Porter resigned over similiar
charges, adding that the adminis-
tration was restricting the growth of
his department. Dornic has since
departed for Maryland, while
Porter has remained at Pitt as an
instructor.

Two long legal battles came to a
close during the fall. Prof. Paul
Nyden, who accused the adminis-
tration of refusing him tenure
because of his political beliefs,

Schulman said, “We’ve gone too

In selecting the new clean,
Rosenberg said basic criteria
included “a broad view of the
liberal arts college, interest in
students and a record of scholarly
work.”

John Ehrlichman, domestic
affairs adviser to President Nixon,
and Keith Stroup, head of the
National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, are
headline lecturers scheduled to
speak at Pitt next fall.

The Pitt Union Programming
Council (PUPC), which will sponsor
the programs, has not yet
contracted any major concerts for
the fall. Tammy Haddad, PUPC
chairman, said the council was
attempting to schedule either
George Benson or Hall and Oates
during Homecoming Week.

. PUPC, instituted by the Student
Government Board (SGB) in April,

interest to undergraduate students. A

“He (Schulman) demonstrated
leadership in presenting programs
to the faculty,” Rosenberg said.
“Schulman has been a member of
the CAS Council and is 1 member of

He was also active on the FAS
committee on faculty tenure and the

Education Cannot Take Backseat to Research

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer

Robert Marshall, outgoing Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
dean, resigned his position last
January, claiming research at Pitt
was gaining priority over the basic
educational needs of students.

Marshall, whose resignation is
effective June 30, said he “caused
a lot of people to give a lot of
thought about those key issues.”
He believes the emphasis at Pitt
today is on professors’ personal
development rather than on their
commitment to the students,
classes and the local University
community.

“If that trend develops,” Mar-
shall said, “then teaching and real
innovation in the curriculum and
individual courses will decline.
What you will have is an institution
primarily designed for the faculty
to do their own thing, and the
students are just passive spectators
who sit at the feet of these
professors.’ ’

Marshall, who held the top
position in Pitt’s largest under-
graduate school for five years, will
return to the faculty in the English
department.

Marshall said his successor
should approach the office as an
“advocacy office,” to protect the
interests of the students.

“The person in this office has to
make a lot of noise on behalf of
undergraduates and teaching,” he
said. “In terms of priorities, they
are at the bottom of the list and
they should be at the top.

“Some people have called me a
one-issue person,” added Mar-

tion both objected earlier this spring

to the idea of using a promoter to
program concerts. BAS ﬁled a letter
of protest over its allocation,
criticizing the system as untested.
However, Haddad said the pro-
‘motor system is the best method to
schedule concerts.

“It is a better way to do concerts
;-because we can get big names, but
Pilot lose money,” she said.
 Student Government set up the
programming council to replace the
ESGB Programming Committee,
which collapsed last year. Several
/concerts planned by the old
programming committee failed,
and the concert subcommittee

became inactive. Only the lectures '

subcommittee of the programming
committee scheduled events before
the establishment of the PUPC.

shall, “and I’d be the ﬁrst to say,
‘yes, I am.’ Everything else is
solved if you deal with that
problem.”

Another issue has been the “gap
that exists between the needs of a
large number of our students and
the way we distribute our re-
sources.”

Marshall explained that about
one third of the freshman class
_sco_res below national average on
SAT’s, and those students’ needs
are not fulﬁlled.

“The point I was trying to make
was a moral, ethical point,”
Marshall said. “Either you fish or
cut bait. If Pitt is going to function.
as an elite school that has an elite
student body, then ﬁne.

“But if it’s going to be a school
with a broad range of students,
then take in consideration the
broad range of students when
distributing resources," he added.

Marshall said there were no
educational changes he would like
to see, but rather a greater
involvement by faculty and stu-
dents. With“ the many educational
changes of the late ’60s and early
’70s, Marshall believed his_mission«.
then was “to make sure the faculty
and students understood and lived
up to the spirit of those changes.”

Marshall__disrr_1issed the notion
of CAS as a “career school."

“The intention of the school is to
take the four years and cause as
much growth as we can in students
in reading, writing, thinking skills
and in awareness of issues,” he

Six chairmen have been chosen to
represent different departments of
the Council.

Kim Popovich will serve as
cultural arts chairman, Debbie
Alpert will assume the special
interest chair, Steve Vance is the

new music chairman, Greg Johnson '

is recreation chairman, Scott Brown
is lecture chairman and Nancy
Whitaker will be visual chairman.

Vance and Brown are seniors‘

while Popovich, Alpert, Johnson
and Whitaker are juniors.

Haddad, who resides in Pleasant
Hills, said her chairmanship is a
“coordinating position “over the
six different departments.

Haddad had been active as RSA
programming chairman this past
year and was a member of the
Tower B dorm council and the
public affairs committee of the SGB.

“The person in this office has to make a lot of noise on behalf of undergraduates and teaching,” says outgoing
CAS dean Bob Marshall. ‘‘In terms of priorities they are at the bottom of the list.” MarshaIl’s term of office ends

June 30.

said. “Unless the student shares
those goals, it’s not going to make
any sense.”

He said undergraduate educa-
tion has to be restructured at Pitt
because too many career-oriented
students enter CAS because of a
lack of options.

“I don’t blame students for

coming into CAS with careeI;.

goals,” he said, “because they
come to their local state-related

university and they find only
nursing and engineering (as
career-oriented colleges).

“The school must offer other
career schools outside of CAS so
that CAS can be true to its
philosophy,” he added.

However, Marshall defended the
liberal arts education, saying it
“doesn’t forget about the practical
needs of jobs.”

He said it is best to develop all of

a student’s abilities to the fullest
“so the student will be in a position
to deal with the great variety of
jobs and occupations.”

On the subject of the plus-minus
grading system instituted last fall,
Marshall said it "inevitably throws
too much focus on the issue of
normal grading rather than on
learning.” He said creating more
competition among students de-
ﬂects from learning.

Outdoor student cafes have been conducted daily by the PUPC throughout the spring and summer. Food,

drinks and quite often live entertainment are offered.

ROTCContinues to Remain

Controversial Issue at Pitt

By JIM MORRISON
Pitt News Staff‘ Writer

Pitt’s ROTC issue never dies; it
just fades away—for a while at
least.

“Just because people are getting
tired of this issue doesn’t mean it’s
going to go away,” Air Force ROTC
cadet Scott Wagner commented
recently.

The issue, a Pitt controversy for
the past decade, centers on ROTC
accreditation in the College of Arts
and Sciences. Last week, for the
third time since 1968, the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences determined that

ROTC courses do not warrant
credit. _

Following the decision, however,
Wagner and other cadets charged
FAS has failed to satisfactorily
address the arguments in favor of
accreditation. And, although many
cadets said they were disappointed,
they have not lost their ﬁghting
spirit.

“There "0 Way We're going to let
this thing die,” said Terry Regan, a
senior Air Force cadet who
spearheaded the accreditation
campaign that ultimately led to the
FAS vote. “lt’s a setback, but we'll
press on.”

“In fact,”vhe added, “We think a
majority of students and faculty
support us. The FAS vote reflected
total disregard for the students and
their representatives who have
voiced support for accreditation.”

“The “real” issue, cadets say, is
the worth of their military and
aerospace studies courses.

According to Army cadet Thur-
man Gardner, Pitt’s faculty is
"living in the past” and “listening
to the radical element.”

“Whether people like it or not,
the military is going to exist. It’s

In the past two years, Pitt Hillel
Club has strived to make arevival on
campus, and according to Hillel
director Rabbi Joseph Levine, the
effort seems to be paying off.

Hillel, Levine said, is supposed to
accomodate the “diversity of
Jewish student ‘ interests.” The
organization offers many programs
including high holiday services, a
Friday night program, social

;’ events, study groups, a kosher
dining center and counseling.

“Our goal is to provide an
environment where students feel
completely free to discuss Jewish
life and to experiment with Jewish

happenings and events,” said
Levine, “we endeavor to create an
open atmosphere.”

Levine, who is chairman of both
the University’s Chaplains Asso-
ciation and the Task Force on
responsible alcohol use, also
engages in student counseling,
particularly in the areas of
intermarriage and interdating. He
said an average of 20 students a
month will seek counseling in those
two areas.

“We do serve as an informal
counseling center where confidence
is respected,” said Levine, “we
don’t presume to have all the right
answers or to legislate a point of
view, but to help students feel free

to discuss their problems in a
non-judgmental environment.”

Though Hillel also has a yearly
campus campaign for Israel and an
“Israel Week ." it is not primarily
a political organization.

“What we do by way of Israel
programming is to help students
who have plans to go to Israel and
share cultural activities of Israel
with Hillel students,” Levine said.

Throughout the year, events such
as Coffeehouses, disco dances,
brunches, bowling or ice skating
parties are planned, but the major
focus of Hillel activity is Friday
night. “That is when the

community gathers in a viable
sense,” Levine said. "

The Sabbath program begins
with a religious service, usually
student organized, which is fol-
lowed by Kiddush (Prayers over the
wine) andrdinner. Afterwards
students may gather for an informal
study session, dance, sing or just
relax. ’

Despite what Levine calls “posi-
tive feedback from students, ’ ’ Hillel
still faces some problems. The
dining center, though renovated
and modernized, has not been
ﬁnancially self-sustaining.
only 27 full contract students, the
center fails to generate enough
income. To break even, a goal of 40
to 50 contracts has been set.

With’

Hillel Attempts to Accomodate Jewish Students Interests

Hillel still must overcome con-
ﬂicts concerning where its primary
focus should be. Levine explained
that some students complain that
Hillel is too religious and not
socially oriented while others claim
the opposite.

Levine noted two areas he hopes
Hillel will become more active in
this coming year. “We want to do
more in the creative arts; music,
singing, dance and drama.” A
performing Israeli dance group is
also being planned.

He alsoexpressed a desire to be
more involved in current issues
such as Affirmative Action,
women's rights, gay rights and
Third World Issues.

Mention ‘ ‘Student Government’ '
and immediately a group of
students bickering in a conference
room somewhere in Schenley Hall
comes to mind.

That may be the case on several
occasions—Student Government
has nine committees, six gover-
nance groups and some 117 student
organizations under its belt—as
well as seven Student Government
Board (SGB) members who
compose the governing body over
the entire bureaucracy.

It is an organization that employs
many of the complications and red
tape that bog down national, state,
and educational administrations.
There is no better place, however,
for a student to get involved.

“It’s important that students get
involved with Student Government
by way of the committees,” says
Josh Baylson, SGB president.
Baylson began his student govern-
ment career by serving on the
allocations committee, whose

purpose is to devise and recommend
methods of distributing funds to
various student groups.

The $12 student activities fee
helps to fund the campus groups.

And while tuition ‘has steadily
increased every year, the student
activities fee has remained the same
since 1971.

Baylson is joined on the Board by
two-year member David Hesidence,
with Stan Galanski, Diane Behers,
Jan Medoff, SharonStarzynski and
Bernie Popko currently in their first
terms of office. '

Probably SGB’s most noteworthy
accomplishment of the past year has
been the emergence of the student
body as a viable .lobbying force in
Harrisburg. Last year state legis-
lators did not approve a budget for
“non-preferred” institutions until
December, and Pitt resorted to
borrowing» money daily to compen-
sate for a lack of funds.

Then the creation of a new SGB
committee-—the Governmental and
Public ‘Relations Committee-—came
into being. Led by Galanski and
chairman ‘Mark McKillop, its
purpose was to send student body
representatives to Harrisburg to
rally votes for increased appropria-
tions for state-related schools.

This past week Governor Shapp
approved the “non~preferred”
status budget—-including $63.1
million for Pitt, a four percent raise

in appropriations and the first
increase in three years.

Chancellor Posvar recently attri-
buted part of the increase to an
effective student lobby.

“I think in this particular year,”
Posvar said, “it (the student lobby)
did not have as much visibility as it
would have had in other years and in
the future. But the fact that the
legislators added four percent to our
budget over the G_overnor’s
recommendation can be traced in
large part to the sympathy the
legislators felt toward our
students.” A

Baylson said eight to 10 lobby
trips to Harrisburg will now be
planned each term.

“Instead of waiting for the
(budget) crunch, we will go the
whole year around,” Baylson said.
‘‘I think the lobby is now going to go
a lot more local this year.”

That effort would involve lobbys
downtown to help alleviate parking
and transportation problems. in
Oakland, as well as improving the
quality of life in the area, according
to Baylson.

The bickering and politicking are
present in all facets of the Student
Government, but basically the
intentions are for the good of the
students and are directed toward
providing services to the under-
graduate body at Pitt.

Here \ is a breakdown of the

different facets of student
government:

New Admissions
Director Named

By JIM LEWIS
_ PittNewsSlaffWriter

Joseph A. Merante was named
director of admissions Monday,
replacing interim director Sam
Deep.

Merante, current director of
Duquesne Univeristy’s admissions
office——a post he held since
1969—will assume his new position
July 1 with alleged housing,
minority enrollment and student
quality problems to solve.

“I.haven’t seen any information
on the quality of Pitt students,”
Merante said. “Of course, there is
the problem of identifying what
‘quality’ is-—it depends on one’s
perception of quality.”

Allegations against the Uni-
versity’s minority admissions
policy needs to be silenced,
according to Merante.

“Pitt is committed to make
certain that minority students are
given the chance to have higher
education,” he said. “That’s our
primary concern—that’s why I took
the job.”

Housing problems will be al-
leviated by,the purchase of the
Forbes Pavillion, Mercante said,

“The number of resident
students will increase due to the
new housing facility,” he said.
“There will be more cosmopolitan
students.”

Merante, who developed such
programs as Project Committment
(an admissions program for dis-
advantaged students) and the
Scholars Program in his three-year
career at Duquesne, will find a
larger work load at Pitt.

“Pitt is about four times larger
than Duquesne,” Merante said of
the private university downtown.
“Although Duquesne admitted
students from 35 different states
and many foreign countries, Pitt's
student body is mainly made up of
students from the western Penn-
sylvania and Philadelphia areas.”

Overall, Mercante believes his
job to be the elimination of the
University’s negative admission
policy image. _

“I want to give admissions a
positive image,” he said. “Pitt
serves the students———admissions
should be attuned to students. We
should let parents know that the
University administration is con-

 it allowing Pitt t0 attract m01'6 concerned. The students come 
non-area students. first,”

a Cafeteria Prices to Remain

Stable Throughout School Year

ByLEONARDROMBERG
Pill News Staff Writer

When Pitt’ students enter the
'dorms and take that first bite of
University food, they will be eating
in the city’s largest cafeteria. During
the fall and winter terms, about
3,000 students eat dinner in the
Towers daily.

The Pitt Food Service, part of the
Auxiliary Services Division, which is
also in charge of housing, is an
independent operation not subsi-
dized by the government, according.
to Barbara Gatti, Pitt dietician.

“The students are paying for
everything: food, labor and
overhead costs,” said Gatti, who
plans the menus and makes sure that
each meal provides a balanced diet.

The food service budget is
approximately $4 million a year.

As any student knows, inﬂation
causes constant price hikes, and in

recent months food prices,
especially beef, have risen at an
unusually high rate. However, Gatti
explained that board rates would not
change through this year.

In planning the budget “every-
thing is projected to expect an
increase in food and labor costs,”
said Gatti. “We did.expect a big
price rise in beef so we looked for the
best buys available.”

Gatti explained that buyers will
shop for special deals, usually
involving large quantities with lower
prices. For example, Pitt’s
hamburgers are the same meat
Burger King buys.

Because the cafeteria is privately
operated, it is not subject to
government standards or controls as
those in public high schools are. But
Gatti said Pitt develops its own

7.»

Most students do not show their frustrations at the quality of cafeteria meals as drastically as this student.

standards to ensure adequate
nutrition.

Students also have a say in what
they are served. A food service
committee, which is part of the
Resident Student Association meets
with Gatti and others to discuss
problems and improvements. Each
dorm sends a student represen-
tative.

“When students find a problem
with the food,” Gatti said, “they
should make the managers aware of
it immediately. Too many times they
eat something they feel is un-
acceptable, and then they will say
how much they hate the cafeteria.”

Students can also use the food
comment cards to express their
opinions.

“While a lot of them have cute

jokes, many have serious
comments,” Gatti said.

 

Anyway, cafeteria officials have promised to keep food prices down throughout the year, and If one dislikes

what is served there are always the comment cards at the exit.

"72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Plttsburgh"

Abandon the Past

The Reverand Timothy Healy of Georgetown University offers
three rules for college-going to freshman. First, he advises that if
one finds what his father expected him to find, he should transfer.

He elaborates: “If the college you go to is any good, it will hit
you like a ton of bricks. It will lead you to question every con-
clusion you have ever reached. . . . You will be stretched till you
squawk. And if you’re not —- transfer.”

Healy’s’ first rule rings true. A good college should make students
think. Unless it does, it is not teaching students anything. If a new
freshman.’ finds Pitt's curriculuum fails to challenge him, he should

follow this advice and transfer to another college 88-80011 as
possible. Although it may be a hassle, it should benefit a

dissatisfied student in the end.

Rule number two is simple: Get lost. Healy advises, “Colleges
can be lonely places so join a few things. . . . Join something and
lose yourself in it.”

Pitt offers a lot of activitieswhere a student can lose himself. For
_the politically-oriented, there are organizations of every per-
suasion, from the Young Americans for Freedom to the Young
Socialist Alliance. Those interested in the performing arts can
check out Studio Theatre or the Dance Ensemble. Singers might in-
vestigate the Glee Club, Heinz Chapel Choir or the Choral Ensem-
ble. Writers might check into Backspace.or The Pitt News. Other
groups too numerous to name cover every interest from
sphelunking to meditation. Getting involved in these organizations
can add to education, and it bests spending spare time watching
TV.

Healy’s rule mumber three is “topical:” “All relevance is
relation.” He later explains, “It means simply that the beginning of
wisdom is the love of one other human being. With any luck you’ll
find one over four years, you might even make it as many as three.
But, if you haven’t learned to love, you haven’t learned anything at
all.” This is so obviously true that no further comment is
necessary.

Healy offers one piece of advice to parents, too. He suggests,
“Let him (students) go. He’ll make every mistake in the book in-
cluding all those of your own that you can still remember. But
unless he’s free to make them for himself, he won’t learn from
them, and until he learns he can’t stop.”

Parents must remember their sons and daughters are no longer
little children, and they must let them go to grow on their own. It

might be nice if parents could protect their children from the world .

forever, but they can’t. College may be the best place for them to
make some mistakes and learn about the world.

.A final appendix to Healy’s three rules is appropriate: Abandorn A
the past. Students must remember high school is over, and they
must live and learn in the present.

New classes are one source of new ideas, which can divorce
students from the past. Although they might be tough, challenging
classes can help students grow intellectually. New friends with dif-
ferent backgrounds, different interests and even different values
can also help students grow beyond high school’s childishness. Pitt
offers the chance for exposure to new people with different
backgrounds and values. New students just have to be brave
enough to use their minds a little and explore.

Letters to the Editor

Welcome to Pitt Freshman Orientation

The Office of New Student
Programs extends a warm welcome
to each and every freshman, and
hopes they enjoy their new
experiences at Orientation 1978 and
at the University of Pittsburgh. The
next four days will be jam-packed
with new experiences, new places to
see and new people to meet. We
hope you will take advantage of this
opportunity to start off on the right
foot, and establish a good working
relationship between yourself and
the University.

We would like to emphasize that
orientation is not simply a four-day
period, but the beginning of an
ongoing process. This is your chance
to become acquainted with the
University as a new student. There
are many services available here to
help you academically, physically,
psychologically and socially. But
you can’t make these services work
for you if you are unaware of their
existence; this is the purpose of
orientation. We have a variety of
progams planned with you, the new
student, covering every major
aspect of Pitt. We urge you to use
these four days and attend as many
programs, talk with as many people
and visit as much of the campus as
possible.

During this initial orientation, we
want you to gain a general
knowledge and insight to the
university that will facilitate “gold-
en opportunities.”

Orientation is a continuum. There
is always something new to learn
about Pitt, simply because there is so
much offered.

SE1 U Loss N 0 A cciden t

The loss by SEIU Local 925 in the
June 7 collective bargaining election
for University technical and clerical
workers was a defeat for all students,
faculty and staff. For the staff,
already low wages will continue to
fall behind inflation, poor fringe
benefits will not be improved and
women still will be grossly
underpaid. Emboldened by their
victory, the administration will have
little to restrain it from continuing its
policy of cutbacks for faculty and
student services. The quality of
education will continue to be eroded,
and tuition will skyrocket despite
this.

This defeat for the academic
community was not an accident; the
administration made sure of that. A
vast, unaccounted-for sum of money
was spent on high-priced,- slick,
union-breaking consultants. A ﬂood

barraged the clerical and technical
staff. Top administrators, with their
bloated salaries, expense accounts
and secure jobs, intervened in a
decision that, pro or con, should be
made and argued by the employees
themselves. A

We can, however, take heart in the
fact that, despite this shameful
campaign, hundreds of workers
‘voted for the union. Dozens of
employees, mostly women, gained
valuable organizing experience.
The union campaign forced a
“coincidental” raise and small
improvement in Blue Cross.

One thing we can be sure of from
past performance; the administra-
tion will not deliver its vague
promises. More and more
employees are coming to see this,

Africa and let the Soviets burn their
ﬁngers, like this country burned its
own in Vietnam and elsewhere. It is
not America’s fault if the Kremlin
can’t learn from Western colonial
mistakes.

But the U.S. should know better
than to start increasing its
involvement in Africa when the
entire issue is not so terrible.

Unfortunately, the problem ex-
tends deeper than minor quibbling
over two African nations. The
Brzezinski camp may be redefining a
relationship that took two decades to
build.

Pitt political science professor
Jonathan Harris, whose area of
study is the Soviet Union, believes
the idea that the U.S.S.R. has a
choice between confrontation and
detente is “mythical.”

“Things have improved over the
last 15 years to the extent that it’s
crazy to talk about Soviet-American
relation in terms of confrontation,”
Harris said. The days of European
confrontations such as the Berlin

B airlift or episodes like Cuba are long

gone.

Harris said the most optimistic
interpretation of American policy is
that Brzezinski is trying to use those
attacks as leverage to gain Soviet
concessions. “That will probably
backﬁre because it simply reinforces
the power of the Soviet Brzezinskis;
those who have a hostile view of the
United States,” Harris said.

While the United States and its
NATO allies have a legitimate
security problem in Western
Europe, the Soviets have a doubly
worse international situation; they
face NATO on the western front and
China on its long southeastern
border.

“It’s as if the United States were
faced with a hostile U.S.S.R. and a
hostile Canada,” Harris said in
comparison. The Russians also have
their Eastern European satellite
nations, which must be paciﬁed.

Harris sees that as a viable
explanation for vast increases in the
Soviet military budget.

A new Strategic Arms Limitation

Talks agreement might help boost
this sagging relationship, putting a
lid on the size of each superpower’s
nuclear force. But Harris said the
agreement would most likely
produce little.

“They are trying to reach
agreement in an area where
agreement is virutally impossible in
the first place,” said Harris. “It
would be a miracle if they got
anything meaningful out of their
negotiations. The military on both
sides never feel they have enough
capability to deal with the oppo-
nent.”

The result is a circular dilemma, in
which agitation by one side serves as
a catalyst for a more conservative
stand by the other. For that reason,
the overly tough talk with the Soviets
is most likely worthless.

It certainly is important to have a
strong defense capability, but
President Carter can best achieve
that by cutting the talk, and working
with the military budget and with the

Soviets for an improvement in _

relations.

Dangerous, Hasty Tax Reform in Harrisburg

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Tax reform plans have been
multiplying like amoebas in state
capitals across the United States in
the wake of the passage of
California’s Proposition 13. Harris-
burg legislators jumped on the
bandwagon during the last two
weeks, proposing four different
bills that could substantially
change Pennsylvania's tax struc-
ture.

Two suggested amendments to
the Pennsylvania state constitution
are designed to curb spending at
the state level and to allow local
government to tax property accord-
ing to its usage. Proposed tax
reform bills also'plan to shift the
local tax base from property taxes
to personal income taxes.

In their rush to placate imagined
hoards of revolting taxpayers, it
seems state politicians are over-
reacting and combating a problem
that doesn’t exist. Exhorbitant
property tax rates like California’s
simply are not levied in Penn-
sylvania because local govern-
ments have always been curbed by
ceilings on tax rates.’

The Legislature’s suggested
‘cures may well be worse than the
disease. The state amendment that
proposes to freeze state revenues
at the $9.64 billion mark is the most
foolish of the four proposals. If this
ceiling became part of the
constitution, it could only _be
revoked by a lengthy process in

which the amendment by the state
Assembly and Senate must be
approved during two consecu-
tive sessions. Then it must‘be
approved by the voters in a
referendum. Locking an instable
beast like a budget at a ﬁxed rate,
then incorporating the freeze in the
constitution, could easily cause a
budget crisis in the state.

If state legislators practice ﬁscal
responsibility, such a freeze is
unnecessary. Unfortunately, repre-
sentatives must make sure their
districts get their fair share of state
funds-—for re-election purposes.
For that reason, they have been
unwilling to cut the state budget.
The state Senate’s override of
Governor Shapp’s $72 million
budget cut shows that it only gives
lip service to any attempt to trim
government spending.

The lid .on revenues also
endangers allocations for Pitt and
other state colleges and universi-
ties. If the state could not fund
colleges and universities
quately, it means permanently
spiraling tuition for Pitt students.

Other proposals before the
Senate are much more sensible and
attempt to deal with the inequity of
the property tax. For years
reformers complained property
taxes are regressive, unfairly
burdening theipoor and the elderly
on ﬁxed incomes.

One bill, which seems the best
tax-reform proposition, suggests
raising the state income tax by one
percent and raising state business

ade--

 
 
 
  

taxes. At the same time, it would
phase out property taxes over a
four-year period. Funds ﬂow back
to the local school districts’ by
increasing state subsidies 50 to 80
percent. This legislation could
more fairly shift the tax burden to
those who can afford to pay.

Still, tax reform is a complicated
issue, and the Legislature should
take more time to develop the best
possible tax laws. When they pass
reform legislation in two weeks
without extensive hearings, legisla-

‘r

tors just might exchange_ old
problems for new ones.
Senator Edward Early’s pro-

posed constitutional amendment
may only shift the brunt of the tax

burden from all citizens to
businesses. It allows local govern-
ments to levy different tax rates on
commercial, industrial and resi-
dential properties.

If this amendment is instituted
without complementary legislation,
school boards under pressure from
voters might cut taxes for residents

and raise property taxes
businesses. Such a situation still
hurts taxpayers.’ Although taxes
drop, increased business taxes
mean higher prices and possible
unemployment.

Instant answers like Edward
Early’s amendment are certainly
dangerous in an atmosphere where
legislators seem willing to pass any
tax reforms to protect themselves.
Slow, thoughtful deliberations
prove to be the best way to prevent
any half-cooked proposals.

The University and the “Vote No
Committee” shared a victory June
7 at the technical and clerical
employees election. Many, who
work and go to school here at Pitt,
are wondering why. Pitt seemed to
have the perfect —-climate for
unionization. It was obvious to
most that the University’s clerical
and technical employees needed a
union.

On the average they are paid 30
percent less than unionized work-
ers doing comparable work. When
Pitt raised the entry level salaries,
some staff salaries had to be raised
to meet it. . The average staff
employee only makes $3 to $4 an

supportive and optimistic toward
the union's chances. So what
‘happened?

It seems that the anti-union
campaign sponsored by the Uni-
versity and its “consultants” easily
could have intimidated voters from
voting pro-union. Voters could
have also been misled by the
propaganda war the University
waged.

For three weeks preceding the

“election, the staff re_ceived— memo-

dums almost daily from Gustav
einecke, vice chancellor of human
resources, of whom many had
never even heard before the
election. The memos described
how much the University loves its
staff and how bad unions are in
general, the Service Employees

International Union (SEIU) in

particular. Certain memos m"is-
represented other SEIU locals and
declared the University would help
its employees come to the right
decision.

Reinecke’s concern for his staff

 'me out in his Point Park memo.

Both he and the "Vote NO
Committee” distorted the facts
about the Point Park College local
of SEIU. Yes, Point Park College
employees make less than Pitt

SEIU?

for a union many of their

employees were making less than »

minimum wage. Point Park
workers, in their first year under an
SEIU contract, had their salaries
raised 13 percent and their beneﬁts
increased. The union will continue
to ﬁght to insure decent salaries,
working conditions and beneﬁts for
Point Park College employees.

The University also sent out
memos warning the staff not to be
intimidated if their vote was
challenged by the union. insinuat-
ing that challenging votes was an
uncommon practice and a scare
tactic used by the union. In seality,
challenging votes in _an election of
this type is normal procedure for
the union, the employer and the
Labor Relations Board; all three
challenged a total of 195 votes.
Workers in supervisory and conﬁ-

vdential positions were to be

excluded from the voting process;
it seems odd that the University
declared only 75 people as
supervisors. The other employees
probably wish this were true.

Another major scare tactic, used
by both Reinecke and the “Vote No
Committee,” was raising the issue
of wages lost during a strike. It is a
major decision for underpaid
workers to strike. But the point is
that they are underpaid.
Reinecke’s memo said the union
could call a strike, implying that
the union is different from the
people in it. Only the members of a
union can call strike—-—through a
majority vote. Actually, 95 percent
of all contracts are negotiated
without strikes. The employer's
willingness to bargain in good faith
prevents their necessity.

-., _a...s............,.~..a...-..W...-....a..... /.:.A..4.. .. .  .

And what of this voluntary staff
organization, the “Vote No
Committee” itself? Whenever and
wherever the issue of unionization
arises, it is typical for such
committees of “loyal employees”
to rush to the aid of their fellow
workers and try to help them
“clarify” the facts. The issue they

G UES T COL UMN
By JOHN HESS

raised in their leaﬂets~—the specter
of lost money from strikes and the
reputed failures of SEIU at Point
Park College—were the same
ominous warnings issued from
Reinecke’s ofﬁce. And can we
assume that these ‘concerned
employees cheerfully donated their
time and money (since it would be
illegal to use University resources)
to run off and distribute materials?

Several questionable occurences
happened the day of the election.
Reinecke sent out a memo, making
allegations about SEIU that it did
not have time to rebut. More
importantly, it is illegal to
electioneer or distribute literature
on the day of the election. Polling
places were reportedly posted with
“Vote No” leaﬂets that had to be
removed. The almost invisible
“Vote No Committee” finally
materialized with reams of leaﬂets
and posters echoing Reinecke’s
charges.

Another possible violation of
election procedure occurred when
Chancellor Posvar and several other

administrators put in appearances
at polling places and had to be
ushered out. No union. or Univer-
sity agent, administrator or super-
visor should have been present at a
polling place. The Chancellor was
supposedly only " owcasing the
architecture of the room. It is hard
to believe that these people didn’t
know they were not allowed to be
there.

Rumors are a common occurence
in elections. Pitt deﬁnitely had its
share. One rumor was that time
clocks would be installed if the
union were instituted. Another was

‘ that union organizers would be ﬁred

and that people who voted would
eventually ﬁnd their way out of
their jobs. Another was that it
really was no secret how you voted;
the University would ﬁnd out.
Rumors are very effective because
they contribute to the confusion
and suspicions some people
already have about unions. There is
no way of knowing where these
rumors started, but it is not hard to
guess. '

After the SEIU petitioned for an
election, the University announced
its 5.5 percent across-the-board
raise for the faculty and staff not
covered by collective bargaining
units for the month of July.
Usually, employees didn’t- know
how much their raises would be
almost until they picked up their
paycheck. The intent of these
memos was to make clerical
workers feel that if a union were
voted in, they would be on their

- own to try to make the University

give them anything. The point of
unions is to collectively make gains
in salaries and working conditions

and to give employees a legal voice
in their workplace.

Why did Pitt sink so much time
and money into the anti-union
campaign, shelling out tuition
money to pay consultants (union-
busters) at least $100 a day each?

The union must have been
threatening something. Through-
out the campaign, Pitt empha-
sized its concern for the welfare of
its employees, students and the
University itself. Yet, staff workers
must face spiraling food and utility
costs at barely above minimum
wage. And, if they have any
complaints, they are faced with a
“Bermuda Triangle” grievance
procedure. Students already know
they don’t— account for much
concern in the hearts of the
University, receiving virtually no
beneﬁts except the third highest
tuition of any state-related school
in the country. So, about whose
welfare is Pitt concerned, if it’s not
staff or students?

Who’s afraid of SEIU? Pitt is.‘
But it’s not just the Service
Employees International Union;
it’s any organized resistance to
University treatment of workers.

We see Pitt shake each time
anyone talks about unionization.

We’ve also seen how Pitt treats its

workers after unions are instituted
(WPIC). Employers always ' lose
sleep when unions come ‘ and
workers stand up for their’fights;

They are afraid they will have to
pay employees a decent living
wage and treat them fairly. If more
unions would implement them-
selves at Pitt, maybe other
employees would recognize their
need to organize. Pitt—being the
largest employer in Pittsburgh-
has much to worry about. Pitt also
seems to be offering a new
course this year: union busting.

lmperialist Student Union.

Love ‘Em or Leave ‘Em, PiH's G

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s 37 Greek letter societies
attract as members less than 10
percent of the University's 17,000
undergraduates, but it is by
tradition an extremely public and
publicized minority that perpetu-
ates Pitt’s fraternities and sorori-
ties.

Much of what the school’s 1,400
Greeks do-and their undertakings
include everything from crowded
frat parties to activity~ﬁlled Greek
Weeks-is highly visible on campus,
as the Greeks prefer. But that same
openness on which the Greeks
depend for recruitment and support
also is the root of an anti--fraternity
and -sorority sentiment that is, at
times, heavy on campus among
independents.

Each side launches an annual
campaign bent on picturing frater-
nities and sororites as extreme:
Greek promote themselves as
leaders and exmplary citizens
cemented by near-mystic bonds
while their detractors, in a much
less-organized but entirely effective
manner, attempt to spread an

image of elitist-for-no-reason,
cliquish fraternity brothers and
sorority sisters.

Each version will be heard often.
by the average underclassmen:
neither is correct.

In the large majority of cases, the
only difference oetween Greeks and
independents is that the Greeks are
organized. That organization, for
example, is the reason fraternities
always occupy the best seats at
football games. It is also the reason
many students pile abuse on Greeks
for the method of saving such choice
seats that is employed; it is, at least
on the surface, grossly unfair that a
few pledges be allowed to hold large
blocks of seats for late-arriving
brothers.

Fraternities and sororities are, in
large measure, social organiza-
tions. Though they enjoy to boast of
well-placed alumni, high academic
averages and traditions of leader-
ship; when placed in the twiceyearly

position of having to recruit
members, rely on parties.
Sororities are not so boisterous,
though their method of attracting
pledges is no more substantive. In
almost every case, a student’s first
contact with the Greek system
comes at a boisterous and
well~lubricated party at a fraternity
house. For $1 or $2 (guys) or a smile
(girls), there is plenty of company,
music, beer and, on occasion, grain
punch.

This method of recruitment,
however, coupled with the Greeks’
natural division from independents
(at football games, for’ example),
cultivates an image that repels
some students. But while Greeks
certainly’ are no better than
independents, this public side is not
their only facet.

Fraternities and sororities at Pitt
raised some$26,000 for charity last
year; donated more than 1,000 pints
of blood to Central Blood Bank;
organized a community clean-up
and participated actively in many
campus organizations and func-
tions.

A house, at base, can only be as
good-or bad-as the students who
belong to it.’ No house is composed
soley of students wishing to make a
career of giving blood and raising
money for the blind, Greek public
relations pitches notwithstanding.
Nor is any house filled with
behavioral deviates, despite the
claims of some fraternities’ more
enraged neighbors (many houses
are located in residential sections).

Students join fraternities and
sororities for myriad reasons: some
are attracted by friends at one of the
houses; others by the beer and good
times; some by the housing offered
by many fraternities and sororities;
and still others by the active life
and“home base” many persons
associate with Greek life.

The average fraternity at Pitt had
43 active brothers last year; the
average sorority was slightly
smaller. Some fraternities, such as
Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI), Sigma Chi
and Pi Kappa Alpha (PIKA), and
such sororities as Delta Delta Delta,

 

‘A typical Fraternity Row at Pitt can be. found on Bayard Street where Sigma Chi, Theta Chi, Zeta Beta Tau and

reeks Are Game

Delta Tau Delta stand side by side. Other fraternity houses are located on Dithridge and Bellefield Streets.

Delta Zeta and Kappa Alpha Theta,
are much larger than the average.
Others, especially less-established
‘houses and those fraternities that
do not occupy houses, are very
small.

One fraternity, Lambda Chi
Alpha, and Kappa Delta sorority
have no members. Each will be new
to Pitt’s“campus this fall, with their
national organizations attempting
to “colonize” chapters at Pitt.

Most sororities offer housing
contracts with the Housing Office
for suites in Amos Hall (in the
Quadrangle). V Fraternity houses are
concentrated on Bellefield, Dith-
ridge and Bayard Street.

For the student interested in
going Greek, neither the average
anti-Greek argument nor-the often
mindless recruiting pitch is much
assistance in moving toward a

year an all-sports trophy is awarded to the fraternity which distinguishes itself in intramural play.

’ do other

reasoned decision concerning which
house, if any, to join.

The student who heeds an
anti-Greek upperclassman and fails
to consider Greek life may be
ignoring an opportunity to make his
four or five years at Pitt more
enjoyable and, in the way. of
activities, more fruitful.

Likewise, the student who joins a
fraternity on impulse after sampling
the food, alcohol and strip show
found at a rush party is likely either
to 1) be sorely disappointed during
his time as a brother or 2) flunk out
of school so quickly that he’ll not be
around to enjoy many good times.

The student who joins a sorority
simply to secure a spot on the Quad
housing list or to put her Greek
letters on a resume may discover
the time and money invested in her
sorority to be wasted.

The Greek strength is numbers,
though each house is composed of
many individuals who- at one time
decided to pledge. And though they
make lasting public impressions
during planned activities, Greeks
spend the majority of their time as
students: proceeding
toward graduation, working to pay
for that procedure, having fun when
they can and worrying about the
Pitt-Penn State game throughout
fall term.

Fall term is important to
fraternities and sororities because
that is the time of one of each year’s
two “rush” periods. That is when
Greeks attempt to find new
members and initiate them through
a “pledge” period. ’

Sororities employ a string of-

initiating activities that are for the
most part ceremonial and harmless.
Following a string through a series
of fraternity houses or conducting a
midnight concert of sisters’ favor-
ites in the Quad are examples of
what a sorority’s pledges must
endure before receiving admission
to the group.

Fraternities are not so easy on
pledges, though the days of
paddling and physical abuse, for the
most part, are past. The tasks of a
pledge at Pitt range from the
wearing (at all times in public) of
fraternity baseball caps at one
fraternity to the saving of football
seats by almost all pledges.
Pledeges answer phones, clean
house,are expected to amass and
memorize information about Greeks
in general and their house in
particular and, of course, look
forward to “Hell Week.”

Hell Week in the past meant

Beth Kukucka photo

extreme mental and physical
abuse;today, the trend is more
toward constructive work for the
house. The pledges spend a period
of time, usually a few days, at the
house, working on pledge “pro-
jects” (usually house repairs or
improvements) and generally doing
the brothers’ bidding.

The vast majority of houses
subject their pledges to tasks that
range from being the subjects of
practical jokes to standing in
“line-ups” or “work sessions” in
which pledges are drilled on
fraternity information.‘

Pledging is a substantial invest-
ment: time and money are involved
in quantities not to be dismissed
lightly (though a fraternity or
sorority with a house offers cheap
rent and a place to congregate).
And a student wishing to exper-
ience the life a Greek leads most of
the time will be hard-pressed to do
so at parties or rush functions.

The most obvious way in which to
sample Greek life is to spend time
with the members of a house. This
is far easier when friends belong to

E in‘

a fraternity or sorority, though mos}; ‘

groups will welcome an interested‘ ’

student.

Another method of discovery is to
frequent placed patronizedheavily
by Greeks. Since all houses are
located in North Oakland, Greeks go
to the bars in that area that attract
college-‘age patrons. Mitchell's
Tavern, the Luna Bar and Haddon
Hall Hotel all along Centre Avenue,
usually count a sizeable share of
Greeks as customers.

Other suggestions might be:.

never accept the first fraternity oi,‘

sorority considered until others
have been surveyed; stay late at
rush parties, tolerate the various
lines offered by gung-ho rush
chairmen but do not be hooked on
those lines; never assume a
fraternity will “grow on you": and
remember that one belongs to a
fraternity or sorority until death or
an unfriendly parting, such as
expulsion, making hasty decisions
risky at best.

Finally, no underclassmen should
feel obligated after having attended
a fraternity’s party, drunk its beer
and promised its brothers (or a
sorority’s sisters) a “consider-
ation. ” There is no moral debt, and
they feel no guilt, remorse or
anything-except, perhaps, a buzz.

Student Cabinet later in the winter,
and Millidge Harris was re-elected
chairman of the Black Action
Society.

For the second time in three_
years, the clerical and technical
staff workers at Pitt considered
unionization. And for the second
time they voted down representa-
tion, this time against Local 925 of
the Service Employees Interna-

after decades of service to the

 

tional Union. More than 85 percent
of those eligible turned out to vote

scheduling events.

“Resignations, Strikes Highlight Year at Pitt   /

The replacement of concrete and
the installation of aluminum bleach-
ers on the student and visitors’
sections at Pitt Stadium mark the
first half of a two-year, million and a
half-dollar resurfacing project now
underway. '

The work is expected to be
completed in time for the football
season, and similar improvements
will be made to the rest of the
stadium beginning in December.

According to Hunt Martin Jr.,
University Facilities Planning Dir-
ector, a leakage, and crumbling
problem underneath the stadium
necessitated the project.

“We feel the restoration will solve
some safety hazards,” Martin said.
“If you walk into the stadium, you’ll
notice that some of the steps are
cracking___and crumbling. We felt
that if we didn't correct it in time, it
could -cause some safety problems
later.”

Martin s’afd’ there had been no

pressure from safety officials to
make the improvements.

The current project is part of a ‘ ‘far
range stadium restoration pro-
gram” that could include . the
relocation of some rest rooms and
the enlargement of’ walkways
around the rim of the stadium,
Martin added.

“We have some other plans, but
they could change in the future,”
Martin said. “Most essential is the
resurfacing and waterproofing
that’s now being done.”

The stadium renovation project is
one of two slated for athletic facilities
at Pitt. At Fitzgerald Field House, a
project to install an additional

Are Pitt Students as Apathetic As They Appear?

By JIM MORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

Considering the much-touted
budget crisis that has University
representatives shuttling back and
forth to Harrisburg, you would think
students’ political awareness would
be high.

Think again.

In an informal Pitt News survey
taken last week———less than two
months before the field of 10 major
state gubernatorial candidates will
be narrowed to two—33 of 100
participating’ students could not
name even one of the contenders.

And,‘ in a year when every
member of the Pennsylvania
General .Assembly is up for
reelection, less than half of the
students responding said they
would vote in the May primary
elections. P

Fifty-two students said they
either haven’t botheredto register
or are registered but not interested
enough to vote.

Responses ranged from‘ “It
doesn’t seem to do any good,” to
“They’re all corrupt,” and “It’s a
hopeless effort.”

Further evidence of student
apathy ' was apparent last week
when a two-day campus registration

‘ drive produced only 108 new voters.

Senior Mark McKillup, chief
orchestrator of Pitt’s student

not the question,” Gardner said.

“ROTC courses have made me a
better person, more confident and
assertive,” Gardner maintained.
“I can use that more than anything
else I’m learning.”

Frank Craig, a senior Army
cadet, claimed he has “had some
CAS courses that are more
military-oriented than ROTC cour-
ses.”

“The people in ROTC believe in
it. Our instructors are qualified, we

lobbying and chairman of the
Student Government Board’s Com—
mittee on Government and Public
Relations was not surprised at the
results of the survey and the
registration drive.

“The situation is not getting any
better or any worse,” McKillup
said. “For me, it’s been a couple of
years of frustration.

“At times I think the students get
what they deserve. I'm amazed we
haven’t gone under,” he continued.

“Students have the potential of
being a major political force,
McKillup said. “But lobbying t-akes
three things—money, expertise and
manpower. We certainly‘don’t have
the’ money or manpower, ‘so
expertise is the only way.

“If students remain apathetic not
even knowing the names of their
representatives, we have to rely on
35 to 40 people to go to the capital
and do the work,” he added.

McKillup did express some
optimism, however. “Pitt’s
approach to lobbying has become
one of practical politics. Our efforts
are better than all the other
state-related schools combined,”
he said.

McKillup explained Lincoln,
Penn State and Temple “have not
taken the practical approach of
developing expertise” and “catch-
ing thelegislators off guard.”

“The legislators know the trends;

aren’t taught to kill and we are free
to take whatever courses we want,”
Craig said.

Some cadets say the military is a
means to an end. Judi Vincenti, an
Air Force cadet, is a nursing student
and receives credit for ROTC
courses.

“I wonder what people think we
actually do,” she said. “I guess
some people don’t know what we
learn. I want to be a nurse and my
military career is secondary.”

Closed Webster Doors Can't Keep Out Memories 5

By JIM PANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

“I just stopped in to say goodbye
to everyone,” said Sally Dobbs, a
long-time employee of Oakland’s
Hotel Webster Hall.

For Dobbs and the people with
whom she has worked for decades,
those goodbyes came Friday
afternoon, just hours before the

_ beloved hotel would lock its doors

for the last time.

And while anticipating the death
of a landmark brings cause for
reminiscence and reﬂection, the
more sentimental Webster em-
ployees found that too dis-
heartening.

“Reﬂections are very sad,”
Dobbs said funereally, then left for
home.

But those on duty Friday
afternoon, those who moumfully
counted down the ﬁnal minutes,
found time to share some, though
certainly not"all, of their most
cherished memories.

“There was this midget,”
recalled desk clerk Mary Egler.
“He used to get dressed up and
advertise for Phillip Morris Ciga-
rettes in the lobby. He was so
funny, with his derby and all.”

Some of the popular remem-
brances concern celebrities.
Maxine Greene, a cafeteria cashier
who has wrung up notables’ bills for
28 years, recalled a few.

“I’ve seen a lot of them,” she
said. “Gregory Peck, Roberta
Peters, Bette Davis and, oh, who
was that? The princess, no, the
queen of Greece.”

By this time,
became contagious.

“I remember Count Basie, Dizzy
Gillespie and Jimmy Dean,” said a
waitress. ‘ ‘Jimmy Dean especially.
He was just great.”

the nostalgia

“Raymond Massy said what
pleasant waitresses we all were,”
said another, “and what a very nice
place this was. He was very nice to
the waitresses. He didn’t look down
on us or anything.”

“Mary Costa was another one,”
said a waitress who wished to be
known simply as Anne. “She was
one of the nicest customers we ever
had, and pretty too. She went into
the kitchen to thank us all.

“She was one of us,” Anne
continued. “I like real people, not
the ones who think they’re better
than us.”

“Jose Greco and Jean Stapleton
were the last big stars to stay here, ’ ’
said another. “Jean Stapleton
stayed here often, because ‘her
daughter goes to school here at
C-MU.” ‘

“Oh, there were so many,”
another waitress added. “Bobby
Vinton, Johnny Mathis-—I waited
on him—and who was that dancer?
Mann. Johnny Mann. He gave all
of us his autograph.”

And the list goes on and on. From
“the guy "who plays accordian for
Lawrence Welk” to Jack Jones’s
son, who ‘ ‘we used to chase onto the
elevators when he was little, ’ ’ Hotel
Websterl-Iall has seen the best of
them.

But that is all passed. Today,
except for the remaining Pitt
resident students who will be gone
at the end of the month, Webster
Hall sits vacant, waiting for
renovations that will transform it
into an apartment facility. The
thought that the 52-year-old hotel
would be no more was heart-
breaking to Webster employees.

“We’ve all been crying,” said
bell captain Bill Davis, a 30-year
employee, “including the cus-
tomers. We all feel like family

 

here—you have to feel that way
after being together for such a long
time. ,

“It became official in January
thatnwe would close down,” Davis
said. “Till then, it had only been
rumor. We’d heard the rumors for
20 years, but we never believed
them.

“Our last guest checked out
today at quarter after one, though,’ ’
Davis said. “Yep, it’s winding
down now.”

Something very satisfying for
Davis and..his fellow workers, who,
by the way, now begin their quest
for new employment, is the
sentimental return of many family
members.

“People have been coming in for
onelast look,” Davis said. “I’m

nwwauowtowwanonwuwwwwwmwtowwwwwwwwwwwwnauowwwwwwwwwwwwwzoww

really amazed at that. I didn’t think
so many people cared about this
place.”

“You should have seen everyone
here last night,” desk clerk Egler
said. “People were stealing salt
shakers, ash trays, anything they
could get as ﬁnal souvenirs.

“Another gentleman came in
yesterday and showed me his room
bill from his wedding night in
1942,” Egler said. “It cost him
$5.50 ‘a night to stay here. That
same bill would be $31 today.”

The loss of other area landmarks,
such as Forbes Field and Duquesne
Gardens, has been the main

_ contributor to Wester’s decline in

business, Davis believes, but he
had no suggestions as to the real

stripped the tables of their red
tablecloths.

Finally, an elderly woman, .. a
35-year resident of the hotel, was
escorted out to a waiting van, which
would take her to her new home.

Hotel Webster Hall was dead.

Jackie Sherrill’s Youth Program Set for Maturity

Gordon Jones Just One Reason Opponents Find Pitt Offense ‘Too Much’

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The climb to -the top of the
mountain is often not as difﬁcult as
the ﬁght to remain at the pinnacle,
and in the world of college football,
where the personnel turnover rivals
a fast-food restaurant at noon, the
job of remaining Number One is
virtually impossible.

With one National Championship
already in tow and the possibility of
another increasing as the ﬁrst
quarter of last year’s opener against
Notre Dame wore on, many rabid
Pitt fans began to see visions of
consecutive Sugar Bowls dancing in
their heads.

Consequently, when coach Jackie
Sherrill’s charges not only failed to
return to New Orleans for a gala
New Year’s celebration, but also
lost to Penn State and Notre Dame
in the same season (which hadn’t
happened in two years), the critics
became’ as
splinters in the seat of one’s pants
after an afternoon at Pitt Stadium.

Granted, Pitt’s season was
somewhat disappointing in light of
the team’s showing in the initial
minutes of the Notre Dame game,
and the sideline strategy could be
held accountable for the three
blemishes on the Panthers’ 9-2-1
record, but the dividends from
Sherrill’s youth program will begin
to roll in the fall. '

Forty-six lettermen return from
the 1977 team, which had eight of its
members selected in the recent NFL
draft. Ten starters, including seven
on defense, return, as do Pitt’s third
legitimate Heisman Trophy candi-
date in as many years, Gordon
Jones.

To the uninitiated, Jones’s
nickname of “Too Much” is usually
spelled h-o-t-d-o- g; faithful Pitt fans
have seen him earn that label time
and again when the 6-0 senior
performed feats of magic with his
hands and his feet.

catches, or how he managed to
disappear from under the noses of a
half-dozen would-be tacklers is
simply insufficient. In the case of
number 24 seeing is believing.
Jones will certainly not be the
only weapon returning from last
year’s arsenal: Rooster Jones is
ready to burst onto the scene as one

of the nation’s ﬁner runners; tight
end Steve Gaustad never drops a
pass; “Fast Freddy” Jacobs is just
that; and offensive linemen Matt
Carroll and Mark May will prove
that running into a brick wall is not
as painful as having that wall run
into you.

The Panthers will have the luxury
of three quality linebackers (Al
Chesley, Jeff Pelusi and_ Desmond
Robinson) to ﬁll the two starting
vacancies.

The defensive line is laden with
talent: Dave Logan was the
Chevrolet Defensive player of the
game "in the season opener;
sophomore defensive ‘end Hugh
Green has a better shot at the
Heisman Trophy than did Ross
Browner; and sophomores Bill
Neill, Jerry Boyarski, Steve Fedell,
Greg Meisner and Ricky Jackson
repeatedly proved that their

presencein the lineup is anything V

but a detriment to the team.

Even as the ﬁnal seconds were
ticking off during Pitt’s 34-3, Gator
Bowl destruction of Clemson last
year, Panther enthusiasts began to
ponder the quarterback situation:
Who would be Matt Cavanaugh’s
successor. The answer to that
question rightfully is: whoever can
get the. -ball to Jones most
frequently.

The candidates for that honor are
sophomores Rickx Trocano and
Lindsay Delaney, and junior college
transfer Scott Jenner. The rap
against Trocano is that he can’t
throw; the word on Delaney is that
he can’t run, and since Jenner is
5,000. miles away in California, he
currently remains faultless.

It is far too early to make any
predictions about possible starters
and won-lost records, .~ but some
things are certain: Gordon Jones is
too much; a Panther victory over
Notre Dame is more celebrated than
a win over West Virginia; but in the
hearts of the students, seeing Pitt
beat Penn State is it.

“With all the adversity and pressure we’ve been
through,” Sherrill said, “this was a must game for
me, the players and our program.”

Pressure could be an understatement. All Sherrill

defeated Clemson, 34-3, in what was billed as the
closest of all post-season matchups, he stood before
reporters in a cramped Gator Bowl locker room and
reflected on a very productive season.

“I’m a very fortunate young man,” Sherrill said,

 as the victory dousing dripped from his head. “I was

fortunate enough to have a coaching staff with great
dedication, as well as a group of dedicated seniors
who did a lot to build this team. There is no way we
could have won this year without our seniors.”

As he called in his assistant coaches to share the
glory, Sherrill hit on a key note.

“Clemson is a real fine football team, who was
overwhelmed by a bunch of determined Pitt
players,” he said. “Our players wanted to go out
winners, and to quell the talk they hadn’t beaten a
real fine team all vear.”

Sherrill beamed as he issued this statement for the
benefit of his benefit who, even though Pitt ended
up only 12 points short of an undefeated season and
a second straight national championship, accused the
Panthers of not being able to defeat a top-caliber

team .

was asked to do at the start of the season was to
defend the national title, and continue what Johnny
Majors and Tony Dorsett had started. There was
nowhere to go but down, and Sherrill knew it.

As the Panthers’ hard-luck season progressed,
Sherrill must have wondered secretly how his team
had made it as far as it did. As far into the season as
a day before the Gator Bowl, he had to pinch himself
to make sure it wasn’t just a dream. He told a bowl
luncheon gathering about his pre-season doubts.

“I’ll have to admit that at spring practice, I didn’t
think we had a very good team,” Sherrill said. “I
thought we’d have to struggle.”

Although it was a struggle, Pitt became more
respectable than Sherrill had imagined. Even with
the loss of quarterback Matt Cavanaugh in the
season opener, the Panthers refused to fold. When
the regular seaon became history, Pitt still found it-
self in the national ranking, with more national at-
tention awaiting at the Gator Bowl. In addition,
Sherrill, with an 8-2-1 record, had a chance to
become the winningest first-year coach in the
school’s history by beating Clemson.

Sherrill isn’t the only man to survive the pressures
of a first-year coaching job. Clemson skipper
Charley Pell took over the school’s gridiron fate last
December, and commenced setting straight a football
team that had won only five games in its previous two
seasons, making a post-season showing this year a
distant dream. , '

“I didn’t even think we’d survive the year,” Pell
admitted.

But 11th-ranked Clemson did survive the season,
and nearly won the Atlantic Coast Conference
championship with an 8-2-1 record. The Tigers’
Cinderella season netted them a Gator Bowl matchup
with the 10th-ranked Panthers, a game “experts”
analyzed as an evenly matched contest.

Sitting in the background was Jackie Sherrill,
licking his chops at the opportunity of showing a
national television audience Pitt indeed could tally
that elusive victory over a “real fine team.” The op-
portunity arose, and Sherrill, his coaching staff and
his players responded. Now, Sherrill’s critics will
have to find another bone to pick.

All this after Sherrill entered the 1977 season vii

Page B-2——THE PITT N EWS—_Saturday, J u

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Villanova’s basketball Wildcats,
riding head and whiskers above the
rest of the Eastern Eight in the
season’s ﬁnal week, came into
Fitzgerald Field House Monday
night only after taking every
precaution to insure that those
whiskers would not be singed by
Pitt. ,

The Wildcats, who had post-
poned the game earlier this month
because of flu, brought an Alex
Bradley who was healthy, a press
designed to make Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich sick and a 7-1 league
record that, they hoped, would have
Pitt dizzy from looking up.

Villanova, a Catholic institution,
even brought a team chaplain, who
sat at the end of the bench.

But while Villanova had Father
Lazar on its bench, the Panthers had
Pete Strickland on theirs. The
difference was after Strickland had
removed his jacket and scored 17
second-half points, Father Lazar
remained on the bench, gazing
toward the heavens. The object of
his attention, more often than not,
was Sam Clancy.

Clancy and Strickland spearhead-
ed a rousing Pitt performance as the

had nice games, Pitt’s (14-8)
battering of the Wildcats (17-7)
most often went something like this:
Strickland jumped up and pulled
the visitors down by those whiskers,
and Clancy punched them in the
face. ,

“Punch” might be too harsh, for,
at least in one instance involving a
Keith Herron break, Clancy merely
put it in his face—-in a manner that
will not soon-be duplicated. Herron,
Villanova’s top scorer at 21.1 points
per game, was alone with Clancy,
nearing the, hoop. Herron double-
pumped and prepared to ﬂoat the
ball toward two points. That was as
far along as he got. Clancy cupped
the ball with his fingers and wrist
and propelled it floorward. Herron
and Terry Knight, off whose chest
the ball hit, each hit the floor.
Knight was more stunned than
hurt. Herron only grinned and
shook his head, relieved that the
most devastating rejection he'll
ever suffer was behind him.

That was only some four seconds
worth of Clancy's 40-minute
performance; the remaining 39

Panthers, tied at the half, scored 59
points in the ﬁnal period to burn
Villanova, 97-81.

Though several other Panthers

minutes and 56 seconds were nearly
as sweet. The fruits of his labors
were 20 points (on 9-for-13
shooting), 17 often-awesome
rebounds and a behind-the-back
pass that signaled victory near the
end. ,

As important as Clancy's 40
minutes, though, were Pete
Strickland’s ﬁnal 15. Strickland,
who was kicked around by fans
earlier this season and then kicked
off the starting team, came into the
game averaging exactly fou'r points
per game.

Midway through the second half,
when Pitt was pulling away from the
Wildcats, it took Strickland exactly
38 seconds to score five points. So
much for his average.

It is fact Strickland’s play was in
no way average, but it was little
different than the job he did in Pitt’s
last win against Maryland.

“Everyone on this team has a
role." Strickland said after being
demoted. For Strickland, of late,
the role has been unexpected star.
It’s a leading role demanding both
talent and performance, but
Strickland, considering a career in
the legitimate theater, has handled
it well.

Panther Hoop Fans

Learned to Always
Expect the Unexpected

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Freshman basketball enthusiasts
who plan to closely follow Pitt
basketball will quickly learn that
nothing can be taken for granted
when the Panthers take the floor.

Last year’s openingmight loss to
Morris Harvey at the Field House
was the omen. The 1977-78
Panthers were known to squander
leads in the final seconds of two

consecutive games (George Wash?

ington and Temple), then come
right back three days later to beat
the nationally ranked Syracuse
Orangemen, 86-81.

Pitt would travel to Cincinnati.
lead throughout the game, only to
lose when two starters were unable
to convert one-and-one opportuni-
ties to ice the victory. On the same
road trip, the Panthers would

rebound and blow Penn State out of
the Recreation Center, 82-65.

Pitt’s worst performance of the
season, an 88-66 drubbing at the
hands of cross-town foe, Du-
quesne, was followed by an
impressive road victory at West
Virginia and an overtime win
against Atlantic Coast Conference
powerhouse Maryland. The Pan-
thers then returned to the Field
House to lose to the Penn State
team they had handily defeated
less than two weeks before.

The outcome of the game
notwithstanding, the major topic of
discussion following an evening at
the Field House was the play of
freshman Sam Clancy. At 6-6, 235,
Clancy has a build that makes
opponents cringe and professional
scouts drool.

(Continued from Page B-22)
ball-handling and outside shooting,
Clancy atones for his weaknesses
with ferocious board play, great
leaping ability and a tendency to
bring down the house‘ (and soon
maybe a backboard) with a vicious
slam dunk.

Clancy will be joined by
returning lettermen Wayne -Wil-
liams, Terry Knight, Ed Scheuer-
mann, Pete Strickland and Dave
Olinger.

If Clancy is the soul of the team,
Williams is the heart. Playing
throughout last season with bone
chips in his left knee, Williams took
over the point guard position at mid
season (a position he had never
played) and played quite well.
Williams, the hardest worker on
the squad, according to assistant
coach Fran Webster, ususally
draws the toughest defensive
assignment.

At 6-11, 215, Scheuermann needs
to add more muscle to give coach
Tim Grgurich the front-court
partner that will make Clancy that
much more effective. .

In the latter half of the season,
Strickland became Grgurich’s su-
per sub, providing ball movement,
aggressive defense or whatever the
particular situation demanded.

Williams Provides Heart

The fruits of the recruiting war
show three guards and two
forwards joining the fold, but it is"
doubtful that any but junior college
transfer Sam Ellis will be quickly
thrust into a pressure situation.

Although neither a letterman nor a ’

recruit, sophomore Carlton Never-
son should see considerable court
time as both a guard and forward.

Replacing Larry Harris, Pitt’s
all-time leading scorer, probably
cannot be done, but his absence
may force the other Panthers to
play to their potential.

‘.‘I think we came closer to
playing as a team last year than
ever before,” said Grgurich. “We
still relied on Larry a great deal,
but when you have someone on the
team that is that good, you tend to
do it naturally.”

With the Eastern Eight playoff
sites to be determined by the
records of the league teams, the
games with division foes will take
on much more meaning.

In the ﬁnal analysis, however, it
may come down to Clancy’s. ability
to carry the team through the hard
times that have been known to
befall Pitt. Noting the size of those
shoulders, that should be no
problem.

Pitt sickened Villanova

(Continued from Page B-22)

“We started Pete in the second
half because" we ﬁgured they’d
come out in a zone, and he was
working the ball well against the
zone,” Grgurich said.

The move, taken in the ﬁrst half _
because Wayne Williams was a bit
off and because the quick pace had
tired several players, brought
windfall proﬁts in the second half.

When he wasn’t shooting six-of-
eight from the ﬁeld, Strickland was
challenging assistant coach Cleve-
land Edwards’ single-game assist
record. He ﬁnished with 11—two
off the record, but more than
enough to spark the type of team
play Pitt has lacked for some time.

Terry Knight contributed 16
points, 10 rebounds and some heavy
work underneath for Pitt. Larry
Harris, who is inching toward Pitt’s
career scoring record largely on
10-foot jump shots, hit nine of ten

foul shots while amassing a
Pitt-high 25 points.

_ Villanova’s Bradley, the second-
best freshman (behind Clancy) in
the Eastern Eight, hit 14 of 17 shots
and paced his team with 35 points.

Herron had 19, but shot only 30
percent from the ﬂoor.

“He (Bradley) could play,’ said
Clancy, who last week advised us
that “Albert King shows me
nothing.” Clancy marvelled -at the
team effort—even the cheerleaders
and Tiger Paul got together at one
point——but was not so complimen-
tary where he was concerned.

9

“This was the team’s best
performance of the year," he
added. “But it wasn’t mine-no,
that won’t come until Wednesday
night.” '

And that, both Duquesne and Pitt
fans are aware, is tonight.

Montgomery ’Skip ’ing Over Obstacles To l.ook for Coach

ByJIM PANE -

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s assistant hockey coach, Bob‘Montgomery,
who is often overlooked for the time and effort he
puts into the workings of the club, may have found
the answer to the Panthers’ coaching bind.

Since the sudden illness last December of former
head coach Len Barcaloyy and his eventual death in
April, Montgomery has been searching for some
hockey brains to replace Barcalow behind the bench.
Montgomery’s hope for landing Russ Musta, the
Moon High coach, dissolved earlier this month when
Musta decided to move on to greener coaching
pastures. ’ '

Musta didn’t leave without a recommendation,
however. The man he had in mind isn’t (as of last
week) totally. sold on the Pitt job, but if he decides to
tackle it, the Panthers are practically assured of a
sixth straight winning season.

His name is Charles “Skip” Remmy, and his
hockey accomplishments challenge those of Bar-
calow’s. A'30-year-old devotee of the game, Remmy
coached amateurs for five years before performing
miracles at Baldwin High School.

In 1974, the year of Baldwin’s inception into the
Western Pennsylvania high school league, ‘Remmy’s
icers won the championship. A year later, they were
class AA and state‘ champs; in 1976, Baldwin suf-
fered an off year, mustering only a co-title in AA ac-
tion. The 1977 season was the real off year for Bald-

win. His team stocked with sophomores, Remmy
was in the midst of a rebuilding program.

That off year notwithstanding, Remmy has proved
he can coach__. A transition to club hockey on a
college level shouldn’t be a difficult one for him.
His youthfulness could also be enough to erase any
lingering memories of Barcalow’s death by the time
next season rolls around.

The only question is whether Remmy will accept
the Pitt position. His second thoughts stem from a
job commitment that would detract from his- full-
fledged participation and overall effectiveness. Right
now, his acceptance is “tentative.”

“I’d sure like the opportunity to coach at Pitt,”
Remmy said, “but I’m not going to do it unless I give
a total commitment. It’s hard for me to do things
half-heartedly.

“I can honestly ‘tell you, I’m gonna give it ad-
ditional consideration. Bob (Montgomery) has done
a fine job with the club, and I’d like to be a part of
it.”

Montgomery had talked earlier about the
possibility of Remmy coaching when he could; Mont-
gomery or another assistant (another position Mont-
gomery is trying to fill) would take over when Rem-
my is unable to coordinate his work schedule.

“It’s either the whole deal or nothing,” Remmy
said. “And with Pitt hockey, that’s the only way to
do it.”

Remmy’s all-out commitment was a factor in
his resignation at Baldwin. 4

“It started one night when I didn’t want to go to
practice,” he said. “That was a strange situation
because I was usually the first one at the rink. I ex-
pect a lot from my players, and they simply all can’t
deliver.” ~

Remmy would like Pitt; the Panthers have been.
known to “deliver” in many a hockey game. But no
matter who leads the ‘78-‘79 coaching duties, the
Panthers will have to do much of the same. ‘

By the looks of the upcoming schedule, any
slacking off will prove disasterous. Try these teams
on for size-all high-caliber squads as far as club
organizations go: Ohio University—a fast-growing
Pitt rival—four games; the University of Virginia,
four games; the University of Cincinnati, four
games; Eastern Michigan—which will meet Pitt for
the first _time—two games; Bowling Green, three
games; and Penn State and Navy at least one game
apiece (the schedule is tentative).

Pitt has played an increasingly tougher slate of op-
ponents over the years, but next year, perhaps, has
the making of the roughest Panther schedule to date.
Pitt, in its five hockey seasons, has never won less
than 12 games in a single campaign. If Remmy“ac-_,

. cepts the head coaching job, the Panthers could be a

“Skip” and a jump away from another hockey win-
ner‘ (Reprintedfmm the March [5, [978 issue of The Pitt
news).

Randolph Becomes Pantherettes’ Career Scoring Leader

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Pantherette basketball squad
-was eliminated from post-season
play Friday night in the first round of

‘ the EAIAW playoffs by Immaculata,

93-71.

Despite a fine performance by
sophomore center Wanda Ran-
dolph, who tossed a game-high 35
points (Randolph, Pitt’s career
scoring leader, passed the 1,000
point mark in the game). Pitt was
outclassed from the start. Im-
macul_ata’s offense was too potent to
contain, particularly since the
Pantherettes were playing without
the services of defensive specialist
Barb Welsh, who left the team last
week.

Immaculata defeated host team
Edinboro Saturday to advance to
next week’s semifinal round. Pitt
edged outPenn Sate, 80-79, in the
consolation game, as Debbie Lewis
scored 27 points and Randolph
added 26. Randolph also had 22
rebounds to go with the 16 she
hauled in against Immaculata.

The- Pantherettes finished the
season with a 14-14' record, their
worst in four years, but coach Jean

lthaser said she was not
I isappointed with the team’s
showing. I

“We lost a lot of close games that
we should have won," Balthaser
said, citing inexperience and
injuries as the prime reasons. “A lot
of tile younger players were much
improved by the end of the season,
though.”

Kathy Stetler Improved Her Way to the Top

By KAREN KADILAK
Pin News Staff Writer

After setting five individual
records at the Eastern regional ‘
championships, Pitt all-American
swimmer Kathy Stetler had one
thing on her mind as she prepared
for the national championships
held in Durham, N.C.

“I’d like to improve my times,”
Stetler said. “I’ve been aiming for
the nationals all year. It would be
nice to do well in them time-wise.”

For Stetlerto accomplish this
goal, she would have to improve
the record-shattering times she
posted in the 50-, 100-, and
200-yard freestyle and 50- and

P 100-yard butterﬂy. ~ For another

swimmer, this goal may seem
unrealistic, but for an Olympic
hopeful like Stetler, Pantherette
swim coach Kate Matheson thinks
it’s a very realistic one.

“She’s having her best season,”
Matheson said. “I don’t see
anything holding her back from

improving her times next weekend.
Right now, she’s swimming so well
that she can do anything she puts
her mind to.”

Matheson thinks Stetler can chop
off as much as three seconds in one
event (200-yard freestyle), and
she’s predicting similar reductions
in the other events.

“I don’t see why she can’t hit the
50-plus (second) range in the
100-yard ﬂy and the 100-yard
freestyle,” Matheson said. “She
can drop down to the 23-plus range
in the 50-yard freestyle, too, and I
can see her swimming a 1:50 in the
200-yard freestyle.”

In addition to her individual
events, Stetler will anchor both the
200-yard and 400-yard freestyle
relay teams. Along with Patty
Davis, Christy Elston and Suzanne
Pulley, Stetler swam to team and
meet records in the '200-yard
freestyle relay.

That record, along with her

individual records, gave Stetler the
distinction of being the’ first
swimmer in the eight-year history
of the Eastern championships to
break six meet records.

For her efforts, Stetler was given
a lengthy standing ovation, the
first such ovation accorded any
swimmer in the history of the meet.

“I can still remember the
ovation,’ ” Stetler said. “After the
team had gotten its awards (Pitt
finished fourth in the team
standings), one of the women
presenting the awards told me to
stay for a few minutes after the
presentation was» over. I didn’t
know what was coming, until I saw
all these people starting to stand up
and applaud.

"‘All of a sudden everyone

started to stand up. It was a
strange experience, seeing all
those people getting up and

clapping for you, but it’s one I’ll
never forget.”

Gymnasts’A|AW Bid

Thwarted

By. a Case

Of Simple lnexperience

By SUE MCFARLAN D
Pitt News Staff Writei

Call it inexperience or call it bad
luck, but whatever it is called, the
Pantherette gymnasts had their
hopes for a berth to the AIAW
national championship doused be-
cause of it at the Eastern Regional
Championship. at the Field House
this weekend.

The young Pantherettes, who
were seeded third behind Clarion
and Penn State prior to the meet,
finished ﬁfth in a ﬁeld of fifteen, with
a score of ‘137.0 behind New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, de-
fending national champion Clarion
(second place) and Penn State, who
claimed first-place honors in the
Friday team competition.

The participants in the AIAW
National Championship in Seattle
are the winners of the nine regitmal
competitions held (across the nation
this weekend added to the next
seven highest’ marks nationally.
Head coach Donna DeMa.rino
believes the Pantherette’s score of
137.0 could possibly place them
among the top scorers in the nation.

The Pantherettes top performers,
freshmen Myra Bachuchin and
Bonnie Tressler, completed the
team competition with all-around
tallies of 35.30, enough to make
Bachuchin a finalist for the following
days’ individual competition on
vault and Tressler on floor exercise
and balance beam.

The next day Tressler went on to
tie for fifth place on the floor exercise
with Clarion’s Karen Brezack with a
score (a combinationof Friday and
Saturday) of 18.0, while Tressler
placed ninth on the balance beam.

Bachuchin placed eighth on the.

vaulting portion of the individual
competition with her score of 18.25
despite a back injury she sustained
vaulting Friday evening.

“Myra and Bonnie have an
excellent chance of placing in
Nationals, as for the rest of the team,
there is an outside chance. We
probably won’t find out until later
this week and until then we’ll just be
biting our ﬁngernails,” DeMarino
said.

DeMarino said she was pleased
with the performance of a young
team that turned in its third-highest
score of the year Friday evening.

“For a young team with only one
senior, no juniors, two sophomores
competing and the rest freshmen I
think they did a fantastic job,"
DeMarino said. “Of course we were
all disappointed, but that was only
natural."

Both the team and indimdual
awards were ‘dominated by Penn
State as the Lady Lions took 16 out!
lit‘ 41 qualifiers to Saturdays ﬁnals
including defending national chain
pion Ann Carr.

Carr, a sophomore from Philadel-
phia virtually stole the show and
every first place award given at the
Eastern championship. Aside from
being a top-flight collegiate per-

former, Carr is also considered to he“

an outstanding international com?-"'1' '

petitor, having won an unprece-
dented ﬁve gold medals at the 1975
Pan American games at age 16.

Reﬂecting on gymnastics at Pitt,
DeMarino noted that the/Panther-
ettes have steadily improved their
performances in regional competi-
tion (21st in 1975; 14 in 1976; 7th in
1977) followed by their fifth place
finish this year. /

“This is the best season ever at
Pitt for women’s gymnastics,and

I’m thrilled with it. Iguess maybe wew


were just expecting too much from"
ourselves this year at regionals, but
there certainly isn’t anything wrong
with setting your goals high.”

Who said it best (or worst) throughout the year?
In the catagory of:

Understatement—Te-mple football coach Wayne
Hardin after his Owls fumbled away a 76-0 decision
to the panthers in Philadelphia: “We got the hell
kicked out of us.”

Pitt’s Tim Grgurich on his basketball team’s
December road loss to Evansville: “We have to learn
how to win on the road, but first we have to learn
how to win period.

Panther football coach Jackie Sherrill after his
team failed to tie Penn State despite scoring a touch-
down with 12 seonds left in their final regular-
season game: “I guess we kept everybody in their
seats.”

Rebuttal—-—Sherrill in Jacksonville after reading an
overzealous newspaper account that had the Pitt-
Clemson /Gator Bowl matchup billed as the “city
slickers versus the country boys”: “I spread more
fertilizer than (Clemson coach) Charley (Pell) ever
did.”

A New York reporter interviewed Sherrill after the
Pitt-Army game and to one of Sherrill’s token post-
game quotes about Matt Cavanaugh (“If there’s a
better quarterback in the country. I’d like to know
where.”) the reporter responded, “Brigham
Young.”

Making the best of a situation—Recently fired
Duquesne basketball coach John Cinicola, who was
asked why he was eating only a bread roll at a buffet
dinner during the Eastern Eight tournament: “I have
to start getting used to these small meals.”

Making the worst of a bad situation—Tennessee

Dick Bradshaw, coach of Pitt’s unbeaten swim
team, after easily beating Cleveland State and
Clarion State in consecutive meets: “It’s hard to get
enough motivation for good times with these kinds of
meets. We need some challenge at the end of the
season,”

Ditto Bob Greenweld, one of Bradshaw’s
freestylers: “These meets are a waste of time. We
would be better off practicing.”

Foresight—Clemson fans talking to their Pitt
counterparts the night before the Tigers lost, 34-3, in
the Gator Bowl: “We love ya for beating Georgia
last year (in the Sugar Bowl), but we’re still gonna,
whup your butts tomorrow.” .

Clemson’s Charley Pell at a Gator Bowl press con-
ference on if he thought at the start of the year his
team, which had won only five games in its previous
two seasons, would be offered a post-season bowl
bid: “I didn’t even think we’d survive the year.”

Hindsight—John Bach, the Penn State basketball
coach who was forced into retirement at the end of
this season, at an Eastern Eight press luncheon:

Damdest Things

“The insignia for the Eastern Eight should be an
eight ball with all the coaches in the league behind it.
I guess I’m living proof of that.”

Miguel Rivera after his water poloists finished
second at the Eastern Championships as a result of a
21-20 sudden-death loss to Bucknell: “If someone
would’ve come up to me when we were ahead by two
goals with 1:1-8 left and said we would lose, I
would’ve bet my neck against it; that’s how confident
I was. But if I had done that, I wouldn’t be here:
talking about it today.”

Outasight—Len Barcalow explaining how he
would alleviate a mid-season lack of motivation on
his hockey team: “Some guys think that just because
they put on a jock before a game they’re going to
play. They’re wrong. I’ve worked a new strategy
called ‘jerk hockey.’ The first guy I see loafing out
there will be jerked off the ice so fast his stick will be
left behind.”

Jackie Sherrill to Gordon Jones after Jones made a
superhero catch to help Pitt beat Navy: “When are
you going to start catching the easy ones?.”

Massachusetts basketball coach Jack Leamon on
Duquesne’s Rich Cotten, who returned from an
ankle injury to pace the Dukes to an Eastern Eight
overtime victory against the Minutemen: “I just
have one question—where the hell is Lourdes? Cot-
ten didn’t look like he was running around on a bad
ankle; you can’t trust those Catholic schools.”

Pitt football fans in Jacksonville who heard that
the Nationally televised I Gator Bowl would be
blacked out in.Jacksonville: “This is the only city
that would black out a sold-out game. It would
probably black out a Christmas Day mass.”

Those same fans comparing the previous season’s
Sugar Bowl experience to the Florida night life: “It

sure ain’t New Orleans down here. It ain’t even.
Pittsburgh.” *

Pitt Swimmers Leave Eastern

ByANGELAVAVITHES
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s swimming team
captured the Eastern championship
for the third straight year over the
weekend with 444 total. points at
Trees Pool. The three-day meet saw
Panther Scott Winkler named out-
standing diver, while teammate
Mark Schuman took the outstanding
swimming award. In addition, coach
Dick Bradshaw was selected coach of
the meet for the third consecutive
season.

“I am pleased with the team’s
performance,” said Bradshaw.
“This year, I think some of the
swimmers who qualiﬁed for na-

tionals have a good chance to place. ’ ’

Pitt took the lead early, winning
three out of ﬁve events the ﬁrst day.
They kept up the momentum and
went on to win more than half of the
events. During the course of the
meet, a total of 15 pool records were
set, 13 Eastern records fell and 14
swimmers qualiﬁed for the NCAA
championships.

. Mark Schuman did a superb job
for the Panthers on his way to the
title of outstanding swimmer. He
took the 200-yard individual medley
in 1:54.53, the 100-yard butterﬂy in
49.37 and the 100-yard freestyle in
45.76. All three were both pool and
Eastern records, and the butterﬂy

Panther Boaters Plan

By ANNA ARLOTTA

The 1978 Pitt soccer team could be
marked for unprecedented success
since coach Leo Bemis will have to
replace .only one starter due to
graduation. That senior was the
starting goalie, Frank Bucci, who
will continue his career profession-
ally with the Connecticut Yankees.

Last season, the Panthers began
to mold themselves into a cohesive
unit and ﬁnished with a 7-7-1 record,

the best showing in the past few
campaigns.

Four Panthers were tabbed
Pittsburgh all-stars (Bucci, Danny
Hamm, Johnny O’Hara and Jerry
Tomasetti), and competed against
the 1980 United States Olympic
team. Karl Nigh, Erv Seigel, Bucci
and O’Hara were named to the
all-Pennsylvania squad; O’Hara and
Bucci were also members of the
all-Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Delaware team.

To counter the loss of Bucci,

performance entitled him to NCAA
competition.

The Pitt freshmen did their part
toward the Panther victory. Jeff
Trew won the 500-yard freestyle in
4:31.96 and the 1650-yard freestyle
in 15:46.87. He also placed third in
the 200-yard freestyle.

Mickey Termin was another
freshman getting his first taste of
college championships. He placed
third in the 500-yard and second in
the 200-yard freestyle.

Stuart Swanson, a world-ranked
backstroker set new records in the
200-yard and 100-yard backstroke,
qualifying for the NCAA in both
events.

Orlando Catinchi, an Olympic
swimmer from Puerto Rico, finished
second in the 100-yard breastroke
and ﬁrst in the 200-yard with a time
of 2:08.65.

Scott Winkler, a sophomore diver,
placed third in the one-meter diving,
but it was his excellent performance
on the three-meter springboard that
won him the event and the
outstanding diver distinction. Pat
Greenwell also performed well on
the three-meter board, taking
second in the event. The Pitt duo
lead the rest of the pack by a large
margin.

Other notable swimmers were:
John Havlik, from West Virginia,

Saturday, June 24, 1978-’-THE PITT NEWS-Page B-9

Foes in Wake

who won the 200-yard butterfly, an
event in which WVU took all three
top spots. His time was a record and
qualified him for the NCAA’s.
Maryland’s Greg Blasic won the
50-yard freestyle in 21.28, a tenth of
a second ahead of Bill Thorne of East
Carolina. Steve Shinholser captured
top honors in the one-meter diving
with an excellent performance.
Bruce Ziegler, from Syracuse took
the 100-yard breastroke in record
time and qualiﬁed for nationals.
Maryland took second in overall
competition with 319 points, West
Virginia took third with 282 and East
Carolina was fourth with 275.

News).

on Doing Some Kicking This Year

Bemis will look forward to the return
of last year’s leading scorer, Craig
Connolly (11 goals), as well as the
additional offense that will be
provided by junior transfer Jeff
Tissue, who led Edinboro in scoring
with 19 goals in 197.7.

‘ ‘Filling the goalie position will be
our number-one priority,” said
Bemis. “We think that we have two
good candidates for the job in junior
John Bonessi and Scott Thunberg,
who will be a freshman in
September.

“The team must show that it can
score goals against tough competi-
tion, though,” Bemis continued.
“With mostly everyone returning
from last year, we won't have to go
through that ‘getting acquainted’
stage, which should make for a
promising season.”

Bemis has also added ﬁve
freshmen to the squad: Alfred
Addlman, Olabode Anise, Craig
McKenzie, Tom Marshall and
Thunberg.

Water Poloists Prove Past Successes Were Not a Fluke

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer.

WEST POINT, N.Y.-—The Pitt
water polo team jelled into a
strong, balanced unit, capturing
the Mid-Atlantic Conference
Championships for the third
consecutive year.

As a result, Pitt will be the

number-one seed in the Eastern
Championships at Trees Pool.
A The Panthers went undef_e_ated,in
the tournament and repaid some
season-long debts by beating Army
in overtime, 13-11; Bucknell, 17-15
and Cornell, 17-9. Throughout the‘
matches, Pitt did what was
necessary to win, coming up with
the clutch goals, ﬁne defensive
plays and key saves at critical
times.

The Saturday afternoon match
with Army was dead even during
the ﬁrst four periods; the lead
changed hands four times, and
there were seven ties. Pitt got onto
the scoreboard ﬁrst when Phillip
Ruiz scored after defense dom-
inated the first ﬁve minutes of play.

 he Cadets stormed right back
with three quick goals to lead, 3-1,
and immediately began to play a
sagging defense in order to guard
against Pitt’s drive-to-the-goal
offense. The Panthers adjusted by
shooting from the outside, - as
George Machicote and Butch
Silva (on a feed from Mike Mere)
scored to tie it up, 3-3, at the end of
the ﬁrst period.

Pitt had a chance to blow Army
out of the pool near the end of the
ﬁrst half, but failed to capitalize on
it. Mike Schoﬁeld scored twice on

ssists from Luis Tom and, after
another goal by Silva, Pitt Led, 6-4,
as the Cadets called timeout. Army
was able to regain its composure,
though, and goals by Robby Ruck
and Jose Duenas knotted the score
at the half, 6-6.

Silva’s goal with 2:30 to play
gave Pitt an 8-7 lead, but Ruck
soon added his second clutch goal
to tie another knot, 8-8. Silva
answered in less than 30 seconds
with his fourth goal of the match,
giving Pitt a 9-8 lead, but Pitt
couldn't stand the prosperity for
long.

The Panthers dominated the
overtime from the start, as
Scholﬁeld and Ruiz each scored two
goals and Pitt held on to win. 13-.11.
Schoﬁeld and Silva shared scoring

honors, with four goals apiece;

"Toro chipped in three assists and

Feller had seven saves.

“We needed a win to boost our
conﬁdence,” said coach Rivera.
“Our defense was shabby at times,
and we have to learn, to take the
outside shot when it is given, but
this can be corrected. Mistakes are
a lot easier to live with after a
victory.”

Saturday night Pitt faced Buck-
nell, looking for its first win over
the Bisons this season. Each squad
played extremely well, and the
game turned into the best match of
the tournament. It pitted against

one another the two best teams in
the East and two opposite -coaching
philosophies. This time, finesse
triumphed over strength .as Pitt
won, 17-15, in a thriller.

From the middle of the second
period, when Bucknell took the
lead, 5-4, until halfway through the
third quarter, the Panthers played
nearly perfect polo. Silva and
Machicote were outstanding;
Machicote had two assists and a
steal, which led to a goal by Mike
Mere, and ran the offense
brilliantly from his post position.
Silva scored four goals ‘during a

six-minute stretch to push Pitt back
out in front, 10-8.

Bucknell made several rushes to
regain the lead, but the Panthers
refused to fold, and won 17-15.

Pitt needed a win over Cornell to
top off what already had been
accomplished in the tournament. It
took the Panthers one period to get
untracked, but after that the
outcome was never in doubt as Pitt
won, 9 17-9.

The key to this success was Pitt’s
ability to move the'ba1l and stick to
its offensive patterns. During the
blitz, every Panther in the water
(except the goalie) scored, and no

one had more than two goals. This
balance and ball movement is an
unbeatable combination, as de-
fense rarely are able to contain
offenses that have more than a
couple of scoring threats.

‘‘I said that we would win the
tournament if we didn’t beat
ourselves,” Rivera said. “We ran
the plays on offense, and Steve
(Feller) played three great games
when we really needed them. I just
can’t say enough about how well
the guys played. I was proud of ‘
them.”

Pitt News Staff Writer

Imagine how Jackie Sherrill felt
during the closing moments of the
1978 Gator Bowl, knowing that
Matt Cavanaugh’s quarterbacking
days at Pitt were over.

Magnify the situation, and one
may be able to sympathize with
Panther track coach Mike Agosti-
nella.

This spring marked the gradua-
tion of more than the usual‘

amount of key athletes from the
squad. Not only have the team’s
top distance runners competed in
their last races for Pitt; the two best
jumpers have graduated as well.
The 1977-78 season was high-
lighted by three seniors’ participa-
tion in the NCAA track and ﬁeld
championships, which were held at
the University of Oregon in early
June. These athletes, Dan Good-
year (high jump), Mel Boyd (5,000
meters) and Dave McDonald

(10,000 meters) all hold some kind
of school record; their victories at
the Central Collegiate Conference
championships led Pitt to an
eighth-place team showing this
season. Also lost to graduation
were distance men Tom Herrmann
(1978 MVP), Rich Moore and
jumper Keith Taylor. p

A strong group of returnees,
including several Pitt team record
holders, will take to the track this
fall, so the overall outlook is not

quite as hazardous as it appears.
Granted, it's hard to replace a pair
of distance men who have run
13:56.2 (5,000 meters).and 29.40
(10,000‘meters), and a 7-1‘/4 high
jumper, but the talent is there.
Sprinters Keith Leckenby and
Larry Shippen are among the
Panthers’ returning record holders.
So is polevaulter Gene Roach, who
as a freshman last season broke
both Pitt’s indoor and outdoor
marks. Decathelete Mike Sapienza,

Graduation Takes Three Stars from Agostinells’s Sky

jumpers Don Maydak and Dale
Baker, plus an experienced group
of distance men, including Gary
Siriano and Randy Bailey, also will
be back.

This past season, the Panthers
placed ﬁfth out of 25 schools at the
indoor conference meet and eighth
outdoors. The schedule included
meets such as the Penn Relays and
Princeton Relays; the Panthers also
hosted an indoor and an outdoor
invitational. ~

., Neither Snow Nor Bitter Cold Could Keep the Fans Away

ByBOBLABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The importance of the game was
such that not even the wrath of
Mother Nature could cool the
enthusiasm of the 56,500 who
braved the elements Saturday at Pitt
Stadium.

There was hardly a thought given
to forfeiting a ticket for the warm
friendly conﬁnes of a living room
seat, as the student section was
overflowing well before the sched-
uled kickoff time of 12:50 p.m.

The heated debates over “who
slipped the knife into whose back
during the bowl scramble” and

“who was going to repay whom_

during the game” were put on ice

(like everything else) before kickoff.

as the fans directed their attentions
to more pertinent questions: How to
keep the feet warm? How to
successfully sneak a pint of liquid
insulation past the “eagle eye” at
Gate 6? Will the Golden Girls
disappoint 56,500 and keep their
capes on, and if they don’t, how to
get close enough to see whether the
cold would give them rosy cheeks?
“Beating Notre Dame gives you a
great feeling,” proclaimed a 1977

‘Pitt alumnus, “but running over

Penn State last year made me feel

twice as good. I love- to see old Joe plenty that, in retrospect. Predicted 8009 this Years 50 Why 5h0“1dﬂ’t I

(Paterno) take it on the chin. Just the
thought of it helps me sleep at night.
Iplan on pleasant dreams tonight.”

Two sideline analysts had the
entire game ﬁgured out while
waiting in line for some of that
non-alcoholic insulation disguised
as hot chocolate.

“Pitt will pass Penn State silly,
take an early lead and then pick off a
couple of Fusina’s passes,” said the
one wearing the button that
phonetically spelled out area
sentiment toward the Lions.

“No way,” countered his com-
panion. “Fusina will pick Pitt apart
because his offensive line will give
him all day to throw. Pitt will be
lucky to score twice.” As if to
emphasize the point, he ﬂipped his
lapel to show a button that proved

people from Penn State believe the
Cathedral of Learning would make
an excellent ﬁre hydrant for State
College dogs.

All the bantering was replaced by
a wait-and-see attitude, as the fans
settled into their seats anticipating
the game that has become one of the
most exciting in the world of college
football.

For those who believe in signs
from the Almighty, there were

a rough day for the Panthers.

The sun made an appearance in
the ﬁrst quarter with Pitt leading,
7-3, and marching toward anpther
score. After the ﬁrst of two passes.
Matt Cavanaugh had intercepted in
the end zone, the sun disappeared,
seemingly content to catch the
highlights the next day on the Jackie
Sherrill Show.

The new scoreboard blew a fuse
early in the second quarter, around
the same time Pitt’s offense began to
short circuit.

And during the pre-game intro-
ductions, a rabid Pitt fan, intent on
voicing his_ displeasure when
Paterno was announced, jumped up
to boo, only to have the bottle of
brandy slip out of its hiding place and
smash at his feet before the seal had
even been broken.

Pitt fans refused to acknowledge
that the Panthers could lose the
grudge match, even late in the game
when it was clear a tie was the best
Pitt could do.

After Elliott Walker was stopped
short on the conversion ‘attempt,
more than one student stood and
cheered as the dejected Panthers
walked to the locker room.

“I never expected Pitt to be this

give them a hand,” explained one
die-hard fan. “Besides, even

though Penn State won, I still believe
Pitt is the better team.

Pitt’s 134-pound wrestler Rande
Stottlemyer won all-America hon-

pacing his team to a 20th-place

Stottlemyer placed ﬁfth despite a
severely sprained ankle that
hobbled him in the Eastern

 tling League (EWL) qualify-

ing tournament.

“Under the circumstances, with
the sore ankle, I’ll take the ﬁfth
place,” Stottlemyer said.‘ “But
earlier in the season, the last thing
in the world I would have wanted
was to place sixth again.”

Stottlemyer placed sixth three

years . ago-—his sophomore year-
and_ won two previous all-America
titles by placing sixth until his
serious injury in a dual match
against Ohio State this season put
his ability to even qualify in
question.

“I think he could have won the
championship if it wasn’t for his
ankle,” Panther head coach Dave
Adams said. “He was pretty well
beat up by his third match.”

Stottlemyer decisioned fifth-
seeded Mike Mathies of Portland
State, 11-7, and Dave Blake of
Arizona, 12-7, before losing to
fourth-seeded Fran Affentranger of
Cal St.-Bakersﬁeld, 11-4.

“My ankle was giving me a lot of

trouble then,” Stottlemyer said.
“After my first match, I began
favoring it—but I just did the best
with what I had.”

Stottlemyer was put in the
consolation bracket where he
decisioned Virginia’s Steve Silver-
berg (5-3 in overtime) and
Nevada-Las Vegas’s Tyrone Rose
(5-1) before dropping his ﬁnal bout
to Franklin & Marshall’s Brian
Brown,-c 9-2.

-Meanwhile, ‘Pitt’s 190-pounder
Bill Bailey won his ﬁrst three
matches to put the Panthers into
the national rankings.

Bailey decisioned Kent State’s
Pete Houghtaling (11-4), Marshall’s
Jeremiah Gaglon (8-5) and Eastern

Illinois’s Robin Ayers (12-9) before
falling to defending champion Frank
Santata of Iowa State, 8-2, in the
quarterﬁnal round.

Bailey beat Florida’s Brian
Gaffney, 7-2, in the Consolation
round, but lost to ﬁfth-seeded
Howard Harris of Oregon State,
12-2, in a match whose winner
received all-American status.

“Bill’s knees were really bother-
ing him,” Adams said. “He had
trouble moving around. ’ ’

Three other Panthers were
eliminated quickly: 118-pound
freshman Glenn Maxwell lost his
opening-round match to Okla-
homa’s Brian Evans, 9-5; 126-
pounder Jose Martinez decisioned

Northern Illinois’s" Lonnie Parker,
10-2; before being pinned by
ﬁfth-seeded Joe Davidson of Rhode
Island at 4:31; and heavyweight
Mark Stepanovich decisioned ﬁfth-
seeded,George Atiyea of Louisiana,
13-5, before losing to.-.Drake’s 6-8,
365-pound Jerry Anderson, 6-2.
“We didn’t have a bad showing, ”
Adams said. “We were 7-of-10
matches won on the ﬁrst day—that’s
the best ﬁrst day I’ve ever had.”
EWL rival Penn State ﬁnished
15th, while Cleveland State and
Bloomsburg, who ﬁnished ahead of
Pitt at the league tournament,
placed 28th and last, respectively.

‘Grease,’ ‘Jaws II’ Over-Hyped 

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer
Grease
Directed by Randal Kleiser

The summer movie season has
opened with two major releases;
both well-advertised, drummed up
and over-rated. “Grease” and
“Jaws II” are disappointing;
however “Grease” proves enter-
taining. _

“Grease” is taken directly from
the successful Broadway musical
about high school kids in the 1950’s.

In the movie, John Travolta and
Olivia Newton-John are billed to sell
the ﬁlm. They play the leads, Danny

ARTS

and Sandy, who are seen kissing
their summer romance goodbye as

. the ﬁlm begins.

But Sandy, a transfer student
from Australia (a move to accom-
modate Newton-John), ends up at

-Rydell High, where Danny and his

gang go to school. The rest is a
seesaw romance. In the spirit of the
50’s, “Grease” is predictable,
which adds to the fun.

Travolta, who just won major ﬁlm
success as Tony in “Saturday Night
Fever,” returns to do another ﬁne
lead role. His dashing dancing
balances a weak singing voice in his
portrayal of Rydell’s leather-jacket-
ed gang leader.

Newton-John’s Sandy is sweet
and pure, never having smoked a
cigarrette or guzzled alcohol. She
portrays her quiet, goody-goody
Sandra Dee-type character perfect-

ly, and has a voice that is as good as
gold.

Travolta works Danny just right,
almost losing Sandy because he
must act “cool” when with his
friends. He manipulates the comic
elements of his character well.

“Grease,” is plagued with
structural problems, however.
Unlike the play,‘it is geared toward a
teenaged audience. The language.
and plot are more temperate than in
the stage version, making the movie
less realistic and, at times, blatantly
corny. ‘ ‘Oh gee, ” just doesn't sound
right“ when uttered by a tough gang
kid.

The play was a parody of the 50’s,
refusing to take anything from that
period seriously, The ﬁlm attempts
to glorify the age of hot-rod autos,
slick hair and Elvis. The net result is
a watered-down ﬁlm.

It is far from a washout, however.
The musical numbers are clever,
well-sung and well-choreographed.
Tunes like “Summer Nights,” a
tribute to the beach romance, and
“Greased Lightning,” a tribute to
the automobile, are outstanding.

Choreographer Patricia Birch
makes the numbers “Greased
Lightning” and “Beauty School
Dropout” shine. In “Beauty School
Dropout,” Frankie Avelon appears
as a guardian angel who descends to
sing his advice to Frenchie, the girl
who has dropped out of high school
and beauty school.

A commendable performance is
given by Stockard Channing as Betty

Rizzo, the tough leader of the Pink.

Ladies gang, who survives a lousy
reputation. She sings a‘ strong and
convincing “There Are Worse
Things I Could Do,” a defense of her
loose ways with the guys.

Despite the small size of her role,
Eve Arden is comical as Rydell
High’s principal.

With Travolta and Newton-John,
there is enough to make “Grease”
enjoyable. But it won’t be a ﬁlm
you’ll talk about come September.

“Jaws II”
Directed by Jeannot Szwarc

It seemed all too familiar. At ﬁrst,
a few unexplainable deaths, a resort
town mayor who won’t listen to his
police chief, pulsating, nerve-itch-
ing music and a 30-foot, $2-million
chomping machine. »

“Jaws” is back: repetitive,
unoriginal, as- ridiculous as‘ ever.
Unlike the original, “Jaws II” fails
everywhere “Jaws” succeeded.
This is a poor excuse for an
adventure film, despite what
seemed to be good opening weekend
crowds. ’

“Jaws II” was doomed from the
beginning. It has neither Richard
Dreyfuss nor Robert Shaw to
strengthen the acting or add spice to
the story. Roy Scheider, as police
chief Brody, stands gallantly alone
among a boring cast of townspeople
and boat-loving teenagers.

Steven Spielberg, whose direc-
tion kept the audience jumping in the
original, had nothing to do with the
sequel. The result is a ﬁlm that is
ridiculous during the shark attacks,
and bland otherwise.

Just how much can one beast eat?
Almost anything in, on or near the
water is prey for this great white, as
he crunches scuba divers, motor-
boats, sail boats, waterskiers, a
giant killer whale and even a
helicopter. This leaves only
subiharines and oil drilling plat-
forms for a future sequel.

In the ﬁnal scene, which is not
climatic, the shark terrorizes a dozen
teenagers out sailing. They become

fast food one by one, until Brody
manages to fry the shark with a

The second time around is just a
letdown. One could gain more
excitement by seeing “Star Wars”
again than wasting time with “Jaws
II.”

The Band’s ‘Last Waltz’: Hardly A Slow

By VERNE L. STEIMER

The Last Waltz
Directed by Martin Scorsese

It is no surprise that Martin
Scorsese’s “The Last Waltz” is no
waltz at all, but a vibrant, very
..’ectric salute to The Band. Had

they called it “The Last Band,”
“The Last Litany,” or “The Last
Wazoo,” it would1still possess the
power and vitality that make it a
vintage concert ﬂick.

A ﬁlm of this genre must stand or
fall on the merits of the COllCt“l'l, this
one stands, jumps, shouts and -gets

down to some of the premier
performances of our time.

The concert is the.1976 farewell,
performance of The Band at Bill
Graham’s Wonderland in Los
Angeles. An entourage of major and
minor luminaries from the ﬁelds of
jazz, country,‘ rock and soul music

The Band star in Martin Scorsese’s concert film, “The Last Waltz.”

joins The Band for a revival of
American music of the past 20 years.

Opening with “Up on Cripple
Creek,” and “The Shape I’m In,”
The Band displays a professionalism
acquired during 16 long years on the
road. Then, Ronnie Hawkins, who
was ‘around for The Band’s genesis,
while still called The Hawks, enters
for an outrageous rendition of
“Who Do You Love.” By the Time
Neil Young contributes his “Help-
less” the celebration is in full
swing.

Interspersed with concert footing
are short interviews with The Band
members. These sma1l_vignettes
reveal much about their personali-
ties, careers and music. Anecdotes
are of the early days—shoplifting in
supermarkets, turning over ciga-
rette machines for smokes—-surviv-
in g on the road. Levon Helms is the
most articulate about their music,
its roots and purpose, but Robbie
Robertson speaks most about the
members themselves.

Robertson exudes a street-
toughened sensuality, reminiscent
of Mick Jagger. He seems to be the
mentor of the group, the driving
force behind their success, and he
even looks somewhat like his
counterpart in the Stones. His
personality is marred by egotism,
yet it is understandable and
forgivable.

When asked why The Band is
quitting the road, he tells of the
trials and “Trivialations” brought
on by the adulations of the fans. He
then recites a litany of great
musicians, taken by the road,

Considering its degree of bore-
dom and nonsense, this production
was a lousy investment. A cheaper
and more believable conclusion
would have been to call in the Army
to ﬁre a neutron bomb at the shark,
thus leaving the thing intact for
“Jaws III.”

comparing himself by juxtaposition,
with the likes of Joplin and Hendrix.

But the weariness of the road life
is best portrayed by the haunting
strains of “Stage Fright,” sung by
Rick Danko, and Robertson’s terse
statement: “I couldn’t even discuss
20 years on the road.”

As the celebration continues, Neil
Diamond, “Joni Mitchell, Paul
Butterﬁeld, Eric Clapton, Emmy
Lou Harris, Van Morrison and
others join voices with The Band‘ for
such songs as “Caravan,” “Evan-
geline” and “Mystery Train.”
Every one will have their favorite
tunes and artists, but one of the
high points has to be the soulful
combination of The Band and The
Staple Singers in a powerful and
moving ‘version of “The Weight,”
performed with all the fervor of a
gospel‘ hymn.

The best is saved for last. Bob
Dylan’s mere presence sets off an
explosive charge of excitement
throughout the audience. His
performance is original and electri-
fying, as always.

He and The Band are as dynamic
a duo as rock music has ever seen;
their superlative performance is
unmatched in exuberance and
vitality. It builds to the climactic
moment when all the performers
return to the stage for Dylan’s “I
Shall Be Released.”

Since you will never get the
chance to catch such a magniﬁcent
and varied array of stars in an actual
concert, and couldn’t afford it even
if you had the chance, you had
better see “The Last Waltz.”

Starlaml Takes Voice on Amusement Park Tour

Roller Coaster Career on U pswing...

ByKEITHBRIANand
PENELOPESAYLES
Pitt News Staff Writers

HERSHEY, Pa.-—In these days of
talking guitars, celestial synthe-
sizers and earth-moving basses,
there is a band whose specialty is the
original musical instrument—the
human voice.

The Starland Vocal Band used that
instrument to the fullest in six
performances at Hershey Park's
amphitheater recently. The four
members harmonized, blended and
alternated lyrics from singer to
singer, reminiscent of the Beach
Boys.

Starland group members include
three freelance musicians as well ‘as
the vocal quartet. Bill and Taffy
Danoff, formerly of Fat City; Margot
Chapman, the second female
vocalist who also sang with Fat City
and later with Jack Williams in a
group called Breakfast Again; and
the multi-talented Jonathon Carroll,
who arranged and helped write the
hit, “Afternoon Delight” at the ripe
age of 19, form the quartet.

Now, at 21, Carroll plays piano,

’ guitar, an occasional drum part and,

of course, his tenor vocal chords. Bill
Danoff is the main lyricist and
Carroll the musical genius, although
the other two play instruments.
Chapman carries the top end of
the four-part harmony, but Taffy
Danoff is the show stopper, the
owner of a strong stage presence.
Starland was impressed by the

crowd of more than 1,100 which
packed the bleachers.

“This is a nice one,” Taffy Danoff
said. “We’ve played to crowds from
200 to 20,000 depending on the park.
We’ve been playing an amusement
park circuit, usually two shows a day
for about an hour each set. It’ 5 really
fun, too; you sing, and then get to go
ride the roller coasters.”

"We’ve played to
crowds from "200 to
20,000 depending on the
park. We ’ve been play-
ing an amusement park
circuit, usually two
shows a day for about
an hour each set. It’s
really fun, too...”

-— Taffy Danoff

Bill, Taffy’s husband, is the
baritone leader of the band, who
earned a degree in Chinese from
Georgetown University. “I spent a
couple of years at The Cellar Door in.
D.C. as the doorman, lightman, and
sound technician, ” said the 32-year-
old Danoff. ‘ ‘I got the opportunity to
see a lot of good musicians
perform-—-Canonball Aderly is one
that comes to mind. We got our start
there and go back to try our new
songs.”

Few realize that the Danoff’s are
responsible for putting one of
America’s premiere performers,

John Denver, into the spotlight.
Seven years ago Bill Danoff and the
former Taffy Nivert wrote a song
called “Take Me Home, Country
Roads.”

“We were on our way home from a
family reunion, driving along some
backroads,” Taffy said about the
inspiration and coincidence that
evolved into the song. “Bill just
sang out, ‘Take me home, country

roads,’ while snapping out a beat

with his fingers.”

“The strange thing is that we
weren’t in West Virginia; I had never
even been there,” Bill added.
“When it came to putting it all down,
West Virginia just ﬁt.”

Taffy said that the song was
originally intended for Johnny Cash,
“but John (Denver) stopped by one
night and we wanted tdishow him
what we had. He fell in love with it
and wanted to do it.”

“After it hit the charts, some
people pointed out that the
Shennandoah River and the Blue
Ridge Mountains were in Virginia,”
Bill said. “But it turned out that in
the corner of West Virginia where it
touches Maryland and Virginia,
both the river and the mountains go
through West Virginia, so we lucked
out by about 10 miles.”

Carroll, the ﬂighty piano pound-

er, mentioned in a cracking voice '

that “the band should be classiﬁed
as a vocal rock group; that fits us best
I suppose.”

Transplanted 10 years ago from

San Francisco to the D.C. area,
Chapman said, “I think our best
effort was the Rearview Mirror
album, but for some reason it didn’t
sell, so we started to push it on our
television show last year.”

“We were lucky to get the

Diamond Reo, a rock ’n roll band
comprising four East Pittsburgh
natives, often performs in the
Oakland area. It has played across
the country with such national acts
as Aerosmith, Kiss, Blue Oyster
Cult and Ted Nugent, as well. ~

If you’re into easy listening,_
Diamond Reo isn’t for you. The act
is loud, pulsating and pure rock ’n
roll—just ask Lou Reed, who was
blown off the stage by Diamond
Reo here in May.

Unlike some bands, Diamond’s
is a combined effort by all its
members. Lead vocalist Frank
Czuri delivers each song from deep
within—inviting, teasing, daring
you to rock ’n roll. Bass player
Norm Nardini is the main force
behind the pulsating madness; Rob
Johns on drums is laid back, but
can take over for a strong solo. An
added attraction is guitarist War-
ren King—alias “The Shark”-one
of Pittsburgh’s finest.

The Diamond’s stage act is full of

°amond Reo\Not
F or Easy-Listeners

tune, demanding more (much of
Reo’s material will be released this
summer on its third album).

The first song of the act. _“l?"""
’n Roll City,” is electY1f3j‘_‘_‘_%'_
Tunes like “Heartbeat,” “Rock
You” and “Electricity” add to the
excitement. “Party Girl” gives
guitarist King a change to display
his full talent. The pace slows a bit
during Reo’s only ballad, “Dia-
monds Are A Girl’s Best Friend,”
but “Gone Dead Train” replaces
the charge. 

Some say Diamond Reo is a
living legend. That’s a bit too

much. Some say the New Wave.

Maybe. Czuri calls his group “The
New Testament.”

But don’t take his word for it.
Take Reo’s professionalism, the
energy it releases, its fresh
materialmtake all of that and more
and you’ve got a girl’s best friend.

So for those who are true rock ’n
rollers, Diamond Reo is a must. For
those who are not, take a break and
check the group out. After all, they

surprises. The audience is guaran- are Pittsburgh’s only musical
teed to be screaming by the last phenomenon.

Absurd ‘Capricorn One’

‘Flash Gordon’ of ’70’s

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Capricorn One
Directed by Peter Hyams

“Capricorn One” takes up where
“Flash Gordon’ ’ left off—-—with total
absurdity. But one must realize that
the “Flash Gordon” serials were a
product of the l930’s; “Capricorn
One” was produced in the
sophisticated ’70s. ,

Writer-director Peter Hyams
expects us to believe that the CIA,
FBI, a few government officials and
a handful of NASA technicians can
fool the entire world in faking the
first manned Martian landing.

Hal Holbrook plays the master-
mind of the project, which whisks
three astronauts (James Brolin,
Sam Waterston and O.J. Simpson)
away just before the launch, taking
them to some abandoned air force
station somewhere in the American
desert. They are met there by
Holbrook, who informs them that
technical difficulties have forced
him to either scrub the mission and
face the possibility that the space
program may be terminated by

Congress and the President, or
conduct his ludicrous hoax, in which
the astronauts perform before
television cameras in a studio
resembling the Martian surface.

Movies

The astronauts go along with the
plot for fear that their families will
suffer if they say no. So the launch
goes smoothly, the Martian “land-
ing” takes place and the astronauts
head for home. > Everyone is
happy—-everyone, that is, except
Elliott Gould as an investigative
journalist (the most popular anti-
hero in movies today). When the
spacecraft is reportedly burned up
in reentry and the astronauts escape
their kidnappers the desert search
begins.

It is difficult to believe that the
public could be fooled for so
long—especi‘ally the supposedly
intelligent scientists who are
responsible for monitoring the
entire mission .and who eagerly
await any information the space-
craft’s instruments send out. Hol-

brook indicates that the coverup
was constructed in a matter of
months——too short a period to
include all the necessary scientists
and technicians for such an
enormous operation. The CIA can't
do it all.

We are also expected to believe
that Gould and a crusty crop-
dusting pilot—played by Telly
Savalas-can outwit an Army
helicopter search for the lost
astronauts.

As for the astronauts—Brolin
tries as the commander, O.J.’s best
scene is a sprint across the desert,
and Waterston is wasted as a
one-line comic. In one scene, after
Brolin informs his partners) that
they have probably been pro-
nounced dead by NASA, Waterston
answers, “Gee, and I was such a
nice guy.”

It one tries hard enough to
overlook these enormous technical
difficulties, “Capricorn One” can
by an interesting suspense story.
“Flash Gordon” reruns are still
better, though.

Bromberg Album Diverse

By LARRY LUNSFORD

Bandit In A Bathing Suit
The David Bromberg Band
Fantasy Records

This album—as well as The David
Bromberg Band—can’t be classi-
ﬁed. For more than a decade, David
Bromberg’s music has been grow-
ing, and his latest release is as
versatile as the native Philadel-
phian. It has rhythm and blues,
bluegrass, dixieland and just some
plain good music.

David Bromberg has--been around
for a long time", but only since his
venture on his own in 1970 has he
been in the limelight. His first two
Fantasy releases, “How Late’ll Ya
Play ’Til?” and “Reckless Aban-
don,” met with success, and
“Bandit In A Bathing Suit” is
certain to continue that prosperity as
well as attract some new followers.

The multi-faceted musical style of

“ﬁromberg is amazing. The guitars,

andolins, saxophones and fiddies
on side one of “Bandit” are
impressive, as is the instrumenta-
tion on side two. Bromberg’s rugged
vocals are now more acceptable than
in the past, and with this
instrumentation, it doesn’t make

any difference how he sounds.

The superbly engineered album is
kicked off by the title song, a medium
tempo number with good vocals and
sax.‘ It is followed by “If You Don’t

V Want Me Baby, ’ ’ a soul number with

backup harmonies by Martha Wash,
Margaret Redmond and Marilyn
Bryant. The latter is highlighted by a
wah wah mandolin and a sax solo.
The enjoyment is diminished,
however, by a Bromberg soiiloquy of
the Isaac Hayes style.

“Queen Ellen” is a mellow tune
with _a trombone solo. Bromberg’s
vocals and use of Sammy Davis Jr.
mannerisms are somewhat distract-
ing, but the stunning music more
than makes up for the vocals.
“Sweet Sweet Sadness” is a
melancholy, refined Kenny Rodgers
song with a mellow tempo. The
string section and harmonies are
excellent.

The side concludes with “Peanut
Man,” a jazz number with no vocals
except a concluding chant of ‘ ‘Debby
Boone. Debby Boone. Debby Boone.
Jeeze, I wonderl” The hot rhythm
guitar, saxophone, and wah wah
electric ﬁddle add integrity to the
instrumentation.

Side two features four songs, two
of which were performed live at the
Great American Music Hall in San
Francisco last January. These
numbers are “Travelling Man” and
“Northeast Texas Woman.” The
former is a wordy -Woody Guthrie-
type jazz song; the latter is a jazz
tune featuring some heavy sax.

Completing the acoustical side are
“Ugly Hour,” a slow, traditional
Bromberg song done for the unsung
hero, and “Love Please Come
Home/ Blackberry Blossom/Dixie
Hoedown/June Apple,” a pure,
country bluegrass tune, complete
with ﬁddle, mandolin and banjo. The
1956 reproduction brings out the
versatility of the band with a touch of
Flatt and Scruggs memories.

“Bandit In A Bathing Suit” has
much musical ﬂavor. There is
something here to please most
everyone. The vital ingredient is
Bromberg’s charisma. His many
years as backup on more than '75
albums, his tenure at Greenwich
Village and his studies at Columbia
University have given him the
knowledge to blend a variety of
music into an entertaining arrange-
ment.
