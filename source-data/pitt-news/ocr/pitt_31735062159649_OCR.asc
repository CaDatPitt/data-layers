KISSING BABES, SHENANIGANS AND HANDSHAKING '~ Spring

. election campaign at Ellsworth center is wilder than ever this year.

The fuss and fury last year provoked an amazing turnout of 80 per cent

Sigma Chi Loses Fight
For House on Dithridge

Sigma Chi has lost its battle to obtain a fraternity house at
242 Dithridge Street, according to Charles F. Miller, secretary-
engineer of the Pittsburgh Board of Adjustment before whom a
hearing was held yesterday morning.

Sigma Chi fraternity was attempting to change the status of

the boarding house, in which a
number of Sigma Chi’s now live,
to a fraternity house. The house
is owned by the parents of Sigma
Chi member Aris Valli.

In order to make the building a
fraternity house, however, it was

Chi 0 House

Quarantined

A quarantine on the Chi Omega
sorority house that cancelled week-
end activities for some 15 resident
students there will continue to
plague them until the quarantine
runs its course in two weeks.

A quarantine order was invoked
on the house at 147 North Belle-
field Street Saturday afternoon by
city health authorities after it was
found that one of the residents had
come down with what Dr. Auleene
Jamison, director of the women’s
health service, called "apparent
meningitis.”

Taken to Municipal Hospital,
Marian Shoffner, a junior in the col-
lege, is now undergoing treatment.

Five girls were caught in the
house by the order with the other
ten student residents being at their
homes for the weekend. Monday
afternoon the rest of the girls
were allowed to go home, but they
will still remain under observation
until the two-week period is up.

During the rest of the period the
Chi Omega house will be closed
completely.

The quarantine threw, a serious
hitch into plans made ‘previously
to celebrate the founding of the
sorority, one of the largest in the
United States, at a Founder's Day

64 Ballot Spots,
45 Petitions;
MC’s Worried

There is a chance that all peti-
tioners for positions on Men’s Coun-
cil may be on the ballot in the April
19 elections.

the number of positions available on
Council is right, Men’s Council's
nominating committee, which ordin-
arily would choose from among the
petitioners those who would be on
the ballot, may find itself with noth-
ing to do but rubber stamp the peti-
tions.

For Council’s constitution states
that there may be no more than four
candidates for every position avail-
able. That means that for the sixteen
open jobs on council, as many as 64
men could be on the ballot. As of
last Friday, only 45 had turned in
petitions. _
The school which is most remiss
in turning in petitions is Engineering
and Mines, which had turned in only
nine by Friday.

Petitions may be turned in as late
as 5 p.m. this afternoon. Any male
student who will have attained soph-
omore standing by next semester is
eligible to circulate a petition.

Tomorrow afternoon the Men’s
Council nominating committee will
meet to choose the candidates in
the election. ,

Four members of Council have
automatically been elected to serve
next year. This procedure of inter-
nally re-electing a portion of the
membership was adopted_to main-
tain a degree of continuity in mem-
bership. Two othermembers had also
been re-elected, but they declined.

of Dithridge Street residents,
since, being a Class B zone, Dith-
Street is classified as a
residential area, and fraternity
houses are no longer so classified
under present zoning regulations.

Shortly after Sigma Chi members
posted a notice that they were
planning a frat house, some of their
neighbors protested, circulated a
petition, and obtained attorneys to
contest the fraternity’s actions at
yesterday's meeting.

Robert McWinney, counsel for

Causes Lawsuit

An accident that happened on
a fraternity steamboat excursion
has resulted in a suit by the date
of one of the frat men against the
Dolphin Excursion Corp., owner of

‘ the steam boat.

Phyliss Linder, a student at
PCW, is suing the company for
negligence which caused her tofall
and fracture her jaw Oct. 15.

Miss Linder was walking up a
stairway to an upper deck with Al
Pollock, a member of Phi Epsilon
Pi, which sponsored the excursion,
when the swaying of the boat caused
her to fall, she contends.

She said that she suffered a frac-
tured jaw, internal injuries, and
shock. The suit charges the com-
pany with negligence in-failing to

At Model UN

Four college juniors and seniors
will tear their thoughts away from
sambas and coffee plantations and
concentrate on the politics of Bra-
zil at the annual model General
Assembly of the UN next week.

It will be held at the City Col-
lege of New York, April 10, 11,
and 12.

College juniors Sally Sniderman
and Robert C. Wogan, and seniors
Olga Ivanowski and George Roberts
will represent Pitt at the twenty-
third model assembly, where stu-
dent representatives of colleges
and universities in the Middle
Atlantic states will meet and con-
fer exactly as the UN does.

Olga Ivanowski Rapporteur

The Pitt delegation, advised by
Dr. Albert B. Martin, political
science professor, has studied the
problems and policies of Brazil,
which they will represent, since
last December. They were chosen
by a faculty committee in the fall.

Olga Ivanowski has been chosen
as rapporteur for the social and
humanitarian committee, which she
will represent. The other three
committees making up the UN; poli-
tical and security, economic and
financial, and charter revision,
will be represented by Bob Wogan,
George Roberts, and Sally Snider-
man, respectively.

Colleges Represent Countries

Each college represents a parti-
cular country and plays that coun-
try’s role on the various UN com-
mittees, after learning its view-
point outlook, and attitudes.

The model UN is the descendant
of the model assembly of the
League of Nations, which'was

WSGA By-laws Amend

 

_ ~-«Pirint.ed below are the proposed amended articles for the by-
 of Women’s Self-Government Association, drawn up this year

Only one week earlier the "Heart
Hop” had been held in the same
dance hall.

Women’s "rushing was also sched-
uled for the same night as this dance.
So practically all sororitymembers
and those students who had attended
the\"Heart Hop’4’ the week before
weren't interested.

This year is notable for the first
Military Ball to flop financially in
three years. Last Friday’s dance
was held without the backing of Stu-
dent Congress and without tapping
ceremonies by Scabbord and Blade,
honorary military fraternity. These

two reasons probably hadia great
deal to do with causing the $5.00
lost.

Last Fall’s “Panther Prowl,” a

sophomore class dance, also ranked
with the fizzlers. This dance ‘had
been placed out at West View Danc-
land, a beautiful spot for a large
dance like the Military Ball or Spring
Festival. But fora small class dance
it’s too large and too far out of the
city. "
n. The dances described above either
succeeded orfailed because of little
things—the place, the occasion,_
other events. But these “little
things” will influence future dances.
Someone, namely whoever does the
scheduling for next year, should take-
them into consideration.

If you are an out-of-town student who wants a check cashed,

don’t go to the cashier’s office on the twenity-fourthfloor; ‘

they

don’t cash checks for out-of-town students. .
But if you reside in Pittsburgh, “don’t try to cash a check
there either; they cash only checks of out-of-town students.

If you are confused by now, you
are no more so than I. hat is the

policy set down by a certain lacka-
daisical blonde cashier who ain't
mad at nobody_except students.

I went in to cash a check (a Uni-
versity check) and the cashier asked
where I was from. When I told her
she retorted that “we don’t cash
checks from’ out-of-town students.

A student who went in after I did
was told that since he lived in the
city,his check could not be cashed.

Says She’s Broke

Furthermore this cashier once
claimed she did not have enough
money to change a $20 bill. Is it

possible that the cashier of this

great institution does not have change
for a double sawbuck?

Since last Tuesday I have had
Countless hordes of irate Sigma Chis

Most prominent is the Jack Ingrim

its Beta chapter at Penn Township.

.Since the football system has
been overhauled, we recommend a
complete change in the cheer-
leading department. We haven’t
the slightest doubt that” our pre-"
sent‘ crop of all-male cheerleaders
are very nice fellows, and that
they have the best interests 9f the
school atheart, but why all males?

The present system has copied
other schools’ cheering tactics
bowing at the goal line for touch-
downs and extra points, counting
scores by jumping at each count;
why not go all the way by having
girl cheerleaders, as have Ohio
State, Purdue, 3 Northwestern,-
Michigan, and Western Reserve, to
mention a few. We believe this
would raise student cooperation,
and thereby make the spirit what
it should be.

It is a sorry state of affairs
when a drunk can get more noise
from the student body than the de-
signated leaders. The volume of
cheers at the Pitt-Notre Game
game in ’-48 has not been equalled.

Any excuse will do, but get rid
of those boys. We want women
cheerleaders.

Big and little posters gird the
supporting columns in the Tuck
Shop and are plastered all over the
walls authorized as bulletin boards.

Campaigning Lively

Pretty girls, eye-catching slo-
gans, and a few rash promises
show that most candidates aren’t
taking themselves too seriously.
The posters and especially the
slogans are worth a sight-seeing
visit. ‘

Oneposter, shunning the preva-
lent modern tendency to feature
bathing girls or glasses of frost-
cold beer, pictures the candidates
pleading for votes in the simple,
unpretentious dress of cave-men
with a mop of brown hair, and
oddly, an Irish-green animal skin.

Another candidate gave away
free candy kisses to every man
with a sweet tooth last week.

This year the Ellsworth Council
had an appropriation of $1,000 to

1 Easter Flower Show On

June Busting Out/Ill Over at Phipp

"Instead of fields of clover, pre-Easter strollers will now find
neat arrangmentss of eye-catching flower displays to rove through

at Phipps Conservatory.

The annual spring flower show, is the attraction there. ‘It is
sponsored jointly by the City of Pittsburgh hnd the Allegheny

Conference on Community Develop-
ment. The display will run through-
out the Easter season until April
29.

The religious theme of the show
is presented in an almost full-
sized facade of a New England
church. Hundreds of Easter lillies
surrounded by brilliant hues of
velvety red, purple, and blue ciner-
arias and a border of white prim-
roses add color to the display.

A local tone is added to the show
by a scene depicting an old Penn-
sylvania grist mill and two cottages.
The wheel of the mill is turned by
a mountain stream which flows
through agroundwork of forg.et-me-
nots, bleeding hearts, daffodils,

   

and vivid azaleas.

The scene is backgrounded by
western Pennsylvania plants such
as pines, dogwoods, bitches, rhodo-
dendron, and laurel.

The right type of wood for cons-

tructing these buildings instigated
an extensive search, Frank Curto

Phipps horticulturist said. V

It finally was taken from”~h‘un1«
dred year old barn near Canons?
burg. The date “l883" was carved
on one of the boards. 

Despite numerous horticulturagfl
headaches caused by freakish
weather which completely upset

normal timing schedule, Mr. Curto
maintains that the flower show ranks
among the best in the country. *

Steven Barwick have recently joined

The decorating of the Health Ser-
vice, called the Emma Kaufmann
Memorial Clinic, was made possible
by the accrued fund from the sale of
the Emma Kaufmann»Clinic, a part
of the Western University of Penn-
sylvania in 1913.

Work was begun in the consulting
office of Dr. Auleene M. Jamison
last winter, and the outer rooms have
been in the process of redecoration
for the past few weeks.

Students who visit the offices for
a snooze ora checkup mus t no longer
use repaired or borrowed furniture.
Instead, they can make use of one
of the most modern offices in the
Cathedral or in Pittsburgh.

Plans for redecorating and fur-
nishing were made two years agoby
Edgar J. Kaufmann of the downtown
department store. Miss Elizabeth
Kittleberger designed the re-
novated rooms and directed the work
on them.

which are beyond doubt worthy of
publication but which commercial
publishers shun because of the lim-

When monetary considerations re-
sult in the passing over of books
which ran add-to knowledge and
make public important new knowledge
than it is the job of universities,
whose task it is to increase the

works available.

Press is Go-Between

Actually, the University Press is
not a press: no printing is done at
Pitt. The Press is a go-between
more or less for author and publisher.‘

When a manuscript is submitted
to the University Editor and approved
for publication, a printing contract
is made with an outside publisher.
For example, University catalogs
compiled by the Press, are printed
in Philadelphia.

At no time has the cost of publi-
cation beenmet by the sale of books.
The Bultl Foundation and the Uni-
versity itself help to make up t-he
deficits, so that books can be sold
at a reasonable price.

One beautifully bound, and illus-
trated book, “Birds of Western Penn-
s€rlvania,” actually costs about
e even dollars to print but sells for
six dollars.

cations have received a fairly wide

  How Will

(Last of Three Articles) _
Could Pitt have done better than it has in

planning for a field house? By

meant building a more expensive arena with a

larger seating capacity.

‘It’s a tough question to answer. _
Frank Carver, graduate manager of athletics,

points out that Pitt is faced with

trying building problems of any university in the

country. ‘

Ground C osts

“Real estate is very expensive around here,”
explains~Carver. “And the hilly terrain for build-
ing sites not only adds to the cost of construc-
tion but forms a real problem for Pitt in finding
a suitable location for a large building such as

a field house or arena.”

It has already been stated that buildingprices

have risen considerably in the

. The University of West Virginia field

house points this out conclusively.
Built i~n1927 at a cost of $500,000,
the Mountaineer arena seats 6,800
for basketball and provides facili-
ties for wrestling, tennis and base-
ball practice, ‘-intramural sports,
track, and offices for the Physical
Educationdepartment.

Pitts Get Clubroom

The Panther field house calls for
about the same facilities at a cost
of around $1,350,000. Beside the
activities carried on at West Virginia,
Pitt will also have a, permanent club-
room for the Panther Club, 12 hand-
ball or squash courts, room for in-
door football practice, and a 2-20-
yard track with 2,000 permanent
seats for track meets. .

Then there's Iowa State Univer-

sity. Its field house was built in.

1929 for the Same $500,000. It seats
14,000 fans for basketball. And be-
sides having about the same facili-

Coed Holds Down Second
For Men’s Baseball Team

Pitt’s Babe Zaharias, Ann “Che-
Che” Sweadner, is again in the
sports limelight. She is going to
play amateur baseball for the Stamm
A.A. entry in the
male Central Sub-
urban Baseball
League for the
third consecutive
year.

Although the
league is for men
in the 18-22 year
class, the versa-
tile 20 year-old
junior from Fox
Chapel is slated
to hold down the
second base post for.the O'Hara
Township entry. And not without
reason.

Ann, who packs 135 Pounds on a '

5-2 frame, sports a healthy three
year batting average of .280 and
"can hold her own with boys” as
far as her throwing arm is concerned.
She is righthanded all the way.
Besides her batting and throwing
prowess Ann is also a good fielder

 

and has speed to _burn. Once, when
challenged to a race, Ann beat a
priest of a Catholic war vet team
from Bloomfieldina foot race around
the base paths.

But itisn’t all play and no school

at Pitt?

‘little doubt. With good gates the
Panthers could make basketball a

Best Possible?

There are some who say the Uni-
versity could have built a better
field house than the one now planned.
These people argue that there's a
lot of money in this district, and
with the right civic and alumni sales-
men and the right methods Pitt could
have had a $3,000,000 field house,
too.

But the University is now stuck
with the one they have planned, and
it has to do. At least there are a lot
of schools in the country that won’t
be as well off as Pitt when the field
house is ready for occupancy.

Called Very Successful

By LOIS FOIGHT

The color and tradition of the world’s great literature has
been brought to Pitt through the World Literature series, con-
cluded last week after the second season of its presentation.

Carroll F. Reynolds, arranger for the series, has found this
spring’s lectures to be a highly successful continuation of the

series begun last spring.

The lectures were begun after
members of the faculty and Nation-
ality Room committees put their
heads together to bring about a
continued program for the committees
after completion of the rooms.

Promote Understanding

They wanted some means of pro-
moting a better understanding of
the countries represented by the
rooms and ofall the world's nations
through a survey of their literatures.

Tentative plans for another series
next spring include the literatures
of the Nationality rooms which have
not already been covered. These
Include the Czechoslovakian, Yugo-

‘ slavian, Lithuanian, German, Irish,

and English rooms.

Mr. Reynolds, speaking for the
planning committee, feels that
"Here is an opportunity for students
to take a free course on compara-
tive literatures under some of the
finest professors in thecountry.”

Lecturers Here Best

Many of the men brought to Pitt
for the lectures were natives of
the countries whose literatures
they discussed. Two lecturers
were brought from outside the
country, and the others, leading
educators, teach or have taught at
outstanding universities and col-
leges throughout the United States.

As Mr.Reynolds comments, “We
have gone out to,get"t"he very best
authorities and speakers in the

country.”

This year, tape recordings were
made of all lectures, and will be
available to any interested groups

Exhibit Ranks
Among First

The enamel—ware display in the
seventh floor fine arts library has
everything from soup to nut dishes.

According to the gallery curator,
Virginia Lewis, instructor in fine
arts, the exposition is probably one

of the first of its kind in the country.

It includes pieces from the seventh
century to the present day.

The exhibit, donated by civic and
private collectors throughout the
East and Midwest, has been running
since March 13 and_will end Thurs-
day. It is valued at over $125,000.

An Easter Egg, painted in 1907
for the imperial Romanoff family of
Russia, is worth $20,000 alone.

Most of the enamel work is done
on brass or copper, but some from
the eleventh century Byzantine period
is baked on gold.

ADDITIONS TO THE staff of the
School of Social Work are Miss
Eleanor Hursh, who will teach soc-
ial case work, and Miss Minnie
Harlow, who will conduct classes
in hospital social work. ‘

   

TOP TALENT—These rookies should certainly make a hit when Engi-
neering and Mines Association officials shout “Play Ball” at Westview
Park's Danceland April 21. Pat Clohessy, Mitzi Lux, and Pat Nelson
ought to steal the show at the dance, an annual E&M event.

IN THE DOGIIOUSE -- Girl (Betty Bolger) and dogs get acquainted

 
 

in the kennel where the young puppies were born recently. The full
grown and full blooded Irish Setter, Terry Bumps ]r., is one of the pets
that Betty will enter in dog shows. She and her mother raise the animals‘.

No Bones About 

iP“PPy

Love All Right

By JOAN SCIIEWE

Ifithe world ever goes to the dogs, Betty Bolger, WSGA presi-
dent, will make no bones about it.Puppy love is an every day part

of _her life.

She and her mother, Mrs. John T. Bolger, raise Irish Setters
as a hobby. But training and showing dogs is really more than a

pastime with them. Their pets are‘

treated almost like one of the
family.
"We even have birthday parties,”

‘says Betty, 9. College senior.
 "Mother makes a hamburger cake
with candles.”
Wins First Prize
Betty -began showing dogs ‘.'just
for kicks” when she was 12. Com-
peting with entries from all over
the country in 1943, she won first
prize in the Children’s Handling
Class at Madison Square Garden.
Although she now enters against
professional handlers, Betty her-
self is still an amateur.
The Bolgers started their career
on Terry Bumps,’a gift from a
friend. Their first Irish Setter has
a success story, the household pet
that became a champion. That is,
he won two major shows and nume-
rous small ones.
In a recently published article,
Mrs. Bolger was included as one
I of the prominent breeders of Irish
Setters. While she breeds the dogs
and handles business deals, she
leaves the training up to her
daughter.

I'ome Tiarberslnp
I “I play barber for all our own
.4 dogs, a job which takes about five
hours for eachone,” Betty figures.
This includes clipping their toe-
nails, shearing and trimming their
coats, and sometimes applying
brilliantine. .

3, Names Officers

At a meeting held last week, George
Witkovich was elected president of
the local chapter of Kappa Kappa
Psi, national honorary band frater-
nity. In addition to Witkovich, the
to frat elected Aldo Battistoli as vice
, president, Oliver Keller, secretary,
o and Joseph Campbell, treasurer, for
I the school year of 1950-51.

  

According to Betty, her mother
keeps a world map on which pins
locate the whereabouts of dogs she
has sold. She has sent them to
Washington, Arizona, Canada, and
even Hawaii.

,“A show dog has to have style
and want to show itself off,” Betty
says. ..“We like to raise something
good,” she adds, estimating a high
win in twoithirds of the shows she
has entered her Setters in.
