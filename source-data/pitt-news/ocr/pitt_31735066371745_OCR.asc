Education faculty

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

A l4-page document which pro-
poses total restructuring of the
School of Education and criticizes
Provost Benjamin's recommenda-
tion for the school in his Five-year
Plan was endorsed Wednesday by
faculty of the School of Education.

Of the 120 faculty members
attending the meeting, 91 endorsed
the two-part document, 18 rejected
it, ll abstained.

“Essentially, the first part is a nar-
rative rejecting the Provost’s prelim-
inary recommendations,” said Dr.
Pat Crosson, chairman of the
faculty council. “The second portion
provides a general contour defining
our priorities.”

The first half of the document
refutes Benjamin’s recommendation
to reduce the size of the school on
the basis of its declining enrollment
and the mixed assessment of its
quality.

The document states: “We reject
the argument in the University Plan
that because the quality is not ade-
quate to justify the costs, the school
should be reduced significantly and
be significantly reduced in size at the
same time."

The document also recommends

. push new plan

that the 14 departments that cur-
rently comprise the School of Edu-
cation will’ be refocused and

redefined into three major academic _

areas.

The areas proposed are instruc-
tion and learning, administrative
and policy studies, and psychology
in education. In addition to these
areas, the Institute for International
Educational Studies, both of which
address educational problems in
relation to the organizations in the
environment, will be focused on in
the new school."

“No present unit will remain in its

current form," according to the
document.

In addition to the proposed struc-
tural changes, five major themes
emerged: focusing upon the rela-
tionship between ‘learning knowl-
edge and application of that
knowledge in education; increasing
and further developing structures in
the Pittsburgh/ Western Pa. area;
enhancing the multi-cultural and

international diversity of the school;

adapting education to individual
student needs; and, recognizing and
preparing for the implications of
new technologies.

The process by which the docu-
ment was prepared involved much
communication between the faculty
members. According to Crossen:

SGB suspends

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

 

All actions of the Affirmative
Action Committee of the Student
Government Board were suspended
by the board at their meeting on
Wednesday. The suspension will be
in effect pending approval by the
board of the committee's bylaws.

Board member Mike Ryan intro-
duced the measure saying that with-
out bylaws, the board does not know
what the purpose of the committee
is. Without this knowledge, the
board cannot vote on any programs
that the committee may want to
institute. .

Ryan told committee chairman
Jackie Jackson, “Your committee
essentially does not exist without
bylaws."

Board president ‘ Luke Kluchko
said that the budget of the commit-
tee cannot be voted on until the by-
laws are passed.

After the meeting, Kluchko said
that the board has been having
numerous problems with the com-
mittee. One difficulty involved a

minority recruitment fair that the
committee wanted to hold. Kluchko
had initially told the committee that
funding would not be available from
the board because the fair dealt with
high school students. In addition,
the committee would not be able to
contact any high school students
without permission from the admis-
sions office, which handles all
recruitment activities. Jackson sup-
posedly confirmed plans for the fair
with the admissions office. How-
ever, Kluchko said that he spoke to
Bill Nun from the admissions office
and found that the plans were never
finalized.

The problem will be discussed
with the committee only after the
bylaws have been approved.
Kluchko gave the bylaws “formal
priority.” Kluchko told Jackson,
“Until they‘re [the bylaws] done, you
are not to work on anything else."

The motion to suspend actions of
the committee was passed by a vote
of 5-3.

Also mentioned at the meeting
was the result of the board’s meeting
with the Student Activities Commit-
tee of the board of trustees. The
board submitted its proposal for
South African divestment. The
proposal passed unanimously”.

Doctor stresses conﬁdentiali  
cts in AIDS testing

for subje

ByiTess Warner
The Pitt News

Concern has risen about the confi-
dentiality of AIDS blood tests,
stated Dr. Charles Rinaldo, execu-
tive director of the AIDS research
project known as the Pitt Men‘s

’ Study.

Rinaldo, a professor of pathology
at Pitt’s School of Medicine, said
that gay and bisexual publications
advocate taking the blood test. The
test determines whether or not there
are antibodies present in the blood
which could lead to detecting an
AIDS-causing virus called HTLV-
III.

The results, however, are not
always clear, according to Rinaldo.
A positive test result simply means
that the antibodies for HTLV-III are
present. Only 10 percent of men with
positive results will develop AIDS
or AIDS-related complex. The rest
may be carriers — men who are

unaffected by the virus — who could
be infecting others.

A negative result can also be mis-
leading, because the person could
actually be infected but have not yet
developed the antibodies. _

Another disadvantage is that the
test itself is not 100 percent accurate.
A positive result is 97 percent accu-
rate, while a negative result is 99
percent accurate.

Fears of harassment or discrimi-
nation can create psychosocial stress
for these men, Rinaldo said. If the
men take the test through the blood
banks, they fear they will lose con-
trol of their right to privacy. There is
the threat of lists identifying people
who have taken the test. Test results
may be available via subpeonas to
insurance companies, employers
and government agencies.

Rinaldo stated that these are valid
fears, but he was quick to point out
what the Pitt Men's Study is doing
to combat these problems.

Before the results are given,
Rinaldo explained the person
receives a written explanation of the

test. The person then has the option
of receiving or not receiving the
results. Each individual is given per-
sonal counseling concerning the test
and its results. They then receive a
free screening for the symptoms of
AIDS and ARC.

Because of the accuracy problem
Rinaldo said, people with positive
results will take the test again. He
also said that more sensitive confir-
matory test is also expected to be out
by the summer of 1985, and each
individual will retake the test every
six months.

To relieve the psychosocial stress,

Rinaldo said that the people must be

kept informed. The staff works with
them on a one-to-one basis and they
also have contact with gay counsel-
ing services. The study refers indi-

viduals to groups like Persad and ,

Anawim for support.

Themost important safeguard for
the individuals involved in the study
is a “certificate of confidentiality,”

_ Rinaldo said. This certificate from

the federal government guarantees

Seminars conducted at Pitt
to aid Small businesses

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

Saving employment in Pittsburgh
is the goal of Pitt’s Small Business
Development Center (SBDC). Their
latest project is a series of Tuesday
seminars on financial concerns for
small business owners.

“Statistics show that the largest
percentage of employers are small
businesses,” said David C. Castaldo,
director of the SBDC. He feels that
these seminars will help to prevent
the loss of more small businessjobs.

The SBDC is part of a national
effort to stimulate the economy by
relying on the academic knowledge
that exists in the universities to pro-
vide services that will develop small
businesses. Pitt's SBDC, one of the
l3 in Pennsylvania, has been work-
ing in cooperation with the Student

Consulting Project for over ﬁve
years to provide counseling services
and training.

“We have a lot of knowledge in
the university that is not being ap-
plied in the market place," said Cas-
taldo. “We’re trying to get some of
that knowledge out of the university
and into the market place, where it
could put people to work.”

The financial concerns seminars
cover a range of topics, including
budget, cash flow analysis, payroll,
tax liabilities, funding sources and
financial statements. “A lot of small
businesses have been successful in
the past because of a strong cash
flow.” said Castaldo. “The cash flow
has grown much tighter, technology
is changing and the owners had to
learn how to operate their businesses
more effectively.” I

The classes are taught by Pitt's
graduate school faculty and profes-
sionals from Pittsburgh’s business
community. “We have talent right

here in Pittsburgh and we intend to
rely on it,” said Castaldo.

The participants, averaging 35 a
session and having educational
backgrounds that range from grade
school to graduate degrees, include
owners and prospective owners of
businesses in western Pennsylvania.

Another part of SBDC is the
Advanced Technology Entrepre-
neurial Center (ATEC), which pro-
vides consulting services and
technical assistance specifically to
advanced technology companies in
southwestern Pennsylvania. Most of
'ATEC’s efforts are focused on
assisting companies in obtaining
research funds through federal and
state programs.

One-on-one counseling in‘ techni-
cal assistance management analysis
with a member of the professional
staff and a student consultant is also
available to requesting businesses
for a nominal fee. The center coun-
seled over 450 businesses in 1984.

(‘0I‘lll.I1ll£"¢'1_/I‘0fn page one
stages of the planning process. The
proposals represent a compilation of
many debates and meetings between
members of faculty council, cabinet
and faculty members.

“We chose to build it from the
bottom up. We have redeﬁned our
goals and generally restructured the
departments, so that we can say to
the provost, ‘this is what we want.‘ ”
Crosson said.

“Redefining has to occur periodi-
cally regardless of budget cuts.
Every so often you have to revise
your mission [to determine] if it is
still in line or if you should make
changes," said Nicholas DeFigio,
member of the School of Education
faculty.

“My area, educational adminis-

tration,” he said, “has been talking

. I.  .. Ll L; LA £41’! .3 ' J;

about changes in the education
school prior to the provost’s Five-
year Plan, which came out in
December. We have been talking
about creating one administration
policy studies department from four
existing departments for a long
time.”

The School of Education has also
been asked by the provost to cut its
budget. by 25 percent or more. A

concern addressed in the document

is the relationship of these cuts to the
tenured faculty. V

“The only way to implement the
plan recommendation that the
budget be cut by more than 25 per-
cent is to significantly reduce the size
of the tenured faculty. Our greatest
fear is that voluntary separation
agreements, together with a loss of

morale  will have the predictable

rr,,..,.».

effect of weakening rather than
strengthening the quality of the
School of Education,” according to
the document.

Dr. Nancy Cole, associate dean of
the School of Education, contrasted
the Five-year Plan and the school's

- proposal. One difference, she noted,

is in the magnitude of the reduction
within the school. She also feels that
the school's document is concerned
with quality, not size.

The document will be presented
officially to Provost Benjamin
today.

Pitt gay community finds support, unity

By Kelly Caruso
The Pitt News

The country’s homosexual popu-
lation is estimated conservatively at
about 10 million individuals. There
are no figures available on the
numbers of homosexuals living
together as couples, but social
scientists believe their numbers have
increased significantly in the last few
years. The increase is partly a reflec-
tion of a general trend towards con-
servatism in sexual behavior.
Scientists also attribute the fear of
such disease as AIDS and herpes to
the popularity of a monogamous
lifestyle.

There are numerous organiza-
tions targeting the needs of the gay
community which address issues of

The Pitt News,‘Friday, February 22,” 1985

child custody, employment, housing
and obtaining immigration papers
for a partner. Nationally recognized
organizations include the National
Gay Task Force, the Gay Married
Men’s Association, the Gay Fathers
Coalition, the Lesbian Mothers’
National Defense Fund and the Les-
bian Rights Project.

In Pittsburgh alone, there are ll
gay—oriented establishments. Cer-
tain places are supported solely by
men while others have only women
as members.

One local establishment is for
women exclusively, regardless of
their sexual preferences or personal
beliefs. One of the co-owners, who
asked not to be named, regards the
business as a “communal idea.”
There are 14 owners, who make
decisions for the business together.
She said that people in the area are

receptive and supportive ofthe femi-
nist cause. The co-owner (who
regards herself as a true feminist),
feels the feminist movement in Pitts-
burgh is health, but a lot of people
are only interested in “cashing in” on
the effort. '

Many of the establishments in

_, Pittsburgh offer club memberships

and entertainment along with meals.
Some bars cater to the gay commu-
nity as well.

On the University of Pittsburgh
campus, the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, offers support and under-
standing for homosexuals. Member-
ship is not limited to Pitt students or
faculty. The majority of the group’s
member have experienced instances
in which their sexual orientation was
not well received. All said they had
encountered shock and confusion

that no individual, court or govern-
ment agency can obtain records
from the study that might identify
the participants without the partici-
pants consent. Internal safeguards
are also in place: Each participant is
identified by numerical code. If the
study is done through the mail,
security envelopes are used and
placed in triple-locked storage. The
staff communicates with the partici-
pants only in ways that the partici-
pants direct them to. All staff
members must give a legal pledge of

confidentiality. _
There» are currently 1,300 men in

the first level of the study. The
second level, which deals with indi-
viduals in more intense manner, cur-
rently involves 850 men.

Rinaldo also gave some surprising
statistics during _ his “Ethnic for
Lunch” lecture in, Scaife Hall. He

said that AIDS takes a long time to
develop. The average incubation
period is 29 months, although it may
vary from five to 62 months.

He is also predicting more cases in
the future in the heterosexual com-
munity. There are currently 59 cases
of AIDS among heterosexuals. For
instance, a case in Pittsburgh
involves an athlete who shared nee-
dles for steroids and contracted the
virus. There are also many cases of
female prostitutes infecting hetero-
sexual men.

The overall morality rate for indi-
viduals with HTLV-III is 47 percent.
Although it is suspected that the
virus has been around for many
years, it was discovered only in 1983.

In 1978, French scientists tested
gay individuals in the San Francisco
area. With the development of the
blood test, they went back and
retested the samples for the antibo-

dies. Only 6 percent of the samples
contained antibodies.

In 1984, the scientists contacted
257 of the 360 men involved. The
men were tested again for the anti-
bodies, and this time 62 percent had
developed the antibodies. However,
only 10 percent of the men have
developed AIDS as yet.

Rinaldo also had some opinions
on future cases of AIDS but pointed
out that “this is only conjecture.”
Within the next five years he expects
there to be 25 million men with
AIDS in the U.S. over l5 years old
and unmarried. He guessed that 5
million of those will be homosexual,
although he said that “this [figure] is
on the low side.” A

He expects 10 percent of the
homosexuals have positive results
from antibody tests, and 10 percent
of that — 50,000 men — will develop
AIDS in two to five years.

from their parents when they first
told them of their homosexuality.
One member said that his mother
still cannot talkabout the subject
although she has known for five
years.

One female member said that
when she told her parents, they
reacted by asking, “Where did we go
wrong?" She was told to leave home,
and has not been back since. The
general feeling of the members
regarding acceptance is that there
isn't any.

Still, at least one member of the
alliance feels that there is wider
acceptance of homosexuality now
than in the past. The new media and
the movie industry are responsible
for much of the publicity of the
homosexuality issue, he said.

homosexual stated that positive
exposure is necessary to ensure
acceptance of the gay community.
“It is harder for the majority of men
to accept homosexuality in other
men because it threatens their mas-
culinity," he said. -“They feel if they
get close to male homosexuals they
will become gay also. We are not

freaks. We are just like you in the we -
have fears, dislikes, likes and ‘

emotions.”

Another point that many
members of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance brought up is the incorrect “
notion that some people believe

homosexuals chose to be gay. One

member commented: “I did not‘
choose to be a homosexual. My
friend, who is a heterosexual, asked

‘ me why I didn’t ‘switch back,‘ and I

told him that I never switched over
in the first place.”

Was Justice
Misplaced?

/

Now that some time has passed since Bernard Goetz shot
A four youths in a New York Subway, it is possible to look back
on that case with a helpful detachment.

During the course of Mr. Goetz’s brief celebrity status in the
‘ press, the public learned a great deal about his past: His father
was convicted on a charge of molesting two young boys
(though that ruling was later overturned, and the senior Goetz
pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct), and this
apparently caused Goetz a great deal of trauma. We learned
that Mr. Goetz had been mugged twice and beaten in New York
City, and that he made an ongoing effort to rid his neighbor-
hood of criminals. We also learned that he applied for a permit
to carry a handgun and was turned down.

However, we learned almost nothing of the pasts of the four
youths whom Mr. Goetz shot — only that they all had criminal
records and that they were carrying sharpened screwdrivers in
their back pockets at the time of the shooting. It was a little
publicized fact that none of the youths’ criminal records cited
any instance of violent criminal behavior, though one of the
youths was charged with armed robbery.

Many claim (perhaps gratuitously, as we shall see) that the
youths intended to do Goetz bodily harm with the screwdrivers
that they were carrying, but as mentioned in the Feb. I 1 issue of
The New Yorker, one of the crimes of which the youths had
been previously convicted was breaking into and stealing the
change from video machines. The screwdrivers may have been

carried for that purpose.

At no time during the briefexchange between Mr. Goetz and
the almost publicly anonymous black youths did the youths
threaten to harm him in any manner. They did not wield their
screwdrivers. They did not handle nor in any way harass Mr.
Goetz. One of the four youths asked him for $5. He replied that
he would give them all $5, produced his handgun and shot the
four youths at pointblank range, shooting two in the back and
leaving one comatose and paralyzed from the waist down.

,It is a sad fact that Mr. Goetz was never tried for attempted
murder. He is a free man, while four youths who areapparently
guilty of nothing more than petty crimes, youth and being

, black may never again be free to live the normal lives to which
they are entitled. This is a blow to justice from which we can

only hope to recover.

Subtlety  

In a recent editorial, The Pitt.

News gave us an interesting choice
among various characterizations of
the president of the United States.

Ronald Reagan is “operating 
with ignorance [or]  with malice,”
is “filled with malice or pride or 
lunacy," and is unfit to hold the
office in which he “finds himself.”
All this because the U.S. govern-
ment refuses to submit to an agree:
ment, proposed by the Soviet
Union, not to be the first to fire
nuclear weapons. The Pitt News
found this “puzzling." Instead of
asking themselves why not only the
current, but also all preceding
administrations, have not signed
such a treaty, the editors sank to an
attack on the competence and mor-
ality of the president.

Although it was correctly noted
that it has'been U.S. policy never to
launch a “first strike,” contact with
reality ended here. To understand
the reason why no president has, or
should have, entered into such an
agreement, we must understand why
the Soviets have so often proposed
it.

Over the last two or three decades,
Soviet ‘preponderance in conven-
tional weaponry in Europe has been
balanced by the U.S. nuclear
“umbrella.” NATO has made it
known that if the Soviets invade
West Germany and the military
situation becomes untenable, the
U.S. will retaliate with nuclear
weapons. This is known as “first
use” (a term with which The Pitt
News apparently hasn’t become
acquainted), as distinguished from
first strike. First use could be, and
likely would be, defensive; first
strike is, by nature, offensive.

Of course, no one really expects
an invasion of Europe in the near
future, any more than we expect a

' first strike. The'Soviets don't work

that way. Soviet military might has
two main functions: to keep its satel-
lites-submissive and to buy with
weapons what it can‘ achieve in no
other way — political legitimacy.
One has only to hear someone refer
to “the Superpowers“ —‘ referring to
the U.S. in the same word as the
Soviet Union, equating the two — to
realize this.

What holds NATO together
against this implicit threat is the
U.S. promise, made to Europe
nearly 40 years ago, to use any
means necessary to defend our allies.
If we renege on this commitment,
western Europe —— and West Ger-
many in particular — will face two
alternatives. Either the European
nations will become Finlandized,
neutral sheep to the Soviets, or will
have to develop an independent,

credible (large) nuclear deterrent.
Obviously, the first choice is prefera-
ble to the Soviets, but any rift divid-
ing Europe from America works to
their advantage.

It might be hopedthat no presi-
dent, when faced with the imminent
collapse of Europe, will let an agree-
ment with an aggressor nation stop
him from meeting our obligation to
NATO, but this is not really impor-
tant. If the European people believe
that we have detached ourselves
from their defense, the prophesy will

‘livsﬁsggsdggltffulfllllns: £88 NAT8

The U.S. must continue to show
the will to defend its closest allies
under the central theme of NATO —
an attack on one is an attack on all.
To renounce the first use of any class
of weapon (particularly nuclear
weapons), especially without a cred-
ible conventional deterrent in
Europe, would seriously endanger
the alliance that has kept western
Europe free and at peace since
World War II.

More hi—tech

Enough!

I, for one, am tired of all the yell-
ing and fighting concerning the uni-
versitys’s proposed Five-year
Plan. We should all rally behind our
university and help push Pitt into
the same league as Harvard, Yale
and Stanford. After all, we all rallied
behind President Reagan four years
ago and now look where our country
stands.

Mark me down as one student
firmly behind the university, and to
show my support, I will discount
many of the arguments that the
opponents of the Five-year Plan
have presented.

0 Rhetoric/Communications
-Department:

I am tired of a department that
does nothing but provide a hiding
place for jocks and unintelligent
people. Let's not reduce this depart-

ment, let‘s dissolve it. The space,

could be made, into a computer
center.

0Fine Arts: ~

Face it: How many jobs do you
see in the paper for sculptors or

painters? Let’s quit wasting space‘...

and put in a new computer center. If
pushed, we could convert the build-
ing into something more artsy, per-
haps as a center for computer art.

0School of Education:

To use the business maxim: If it
.ain’t producing, cut your losses and
run. lt’s obvious we aren't educating

, people right, so let's dissolve the pro-

gram. The space could be used fora
computer center.

OGSPIA:

As a native of Pittsburgh, I am
tired of foreigners taking over our
society. First it’s our industry; soon
they will be usurping our academic
positions. Send them home and use
their office space as a computer
center.

0School of Pharmacy:

All of the yelling by these future
druggists has me disgusted. Perhaps
if we werenjt so concerned with drug
liiX‘iEe‘t’s"£?la‘cfi9;9att¢é9s9%t1e\wtJuitrax
have the drug problem that we do in
this country. Cut the school; put in a
new computer center.

These are just some of my views
concerning the Five-year Plan and
the issues that it has raised. If I may
be so bold, I would like to raise one
additional item concerning the pur-
suit of excellence at our university.

At issue is the cafe in the William

Pitt Union. This nice little eatery has ‘

provided me with many fine meals.
However, at times, it is quite
crowded  especially with people
who haven't even purchased a meal
there. I propose we initiate a reserva-
tion policy so that the hardworking
student can look forward to having a
seat when he eats.

As President Reagan said, we are
in a second American Revolution.
Universities should lead the revolu-
tion, and we at Pitt should lead the
leaders.

Irony

This letter is a response to a letter
(“Liberal Error") by Kevin Bold,
printed in the Feb. 13 edition of The
Pitt News. While we do not wish to
address the philosophical issues
raised in Mr. Bold’s letter at the
present, we felt compelled to object
to his concluding statement. Mr.
Bold states: “It is time the kids at
The Pitt News grew up and aban-
doned the ethics of the parasite.”

This statement is ironic for several
reasons. First, it isironic that Mr.
Bold dares to use the word “para-
site." Nearly every line in his letter is
either a paraphrase or direct quote
from the writings of Ayn Rand for
which he gives no credit to the
author or a bastardization of Rand‘s
ideas. ,. 

Second, it is ironic that Mr. Bold

‘makes use of the condescending
, epithet “kid." If that capacity for

independent and original thinking
can be considered as a partial index
of intellectual maturity, plagiarism
such as that of Mr. Bold‘s can hardly
be considered, adult behavior.

T»

Mr. Bold should take notice: Ayn
Rand's philosophy, while condemn-
ing material parasitism, reserves its
strongest words of condemnation
for the intellectual parasite. If “the
kids of The Pitt News” have demon-
strated any failing in this affair, it is
in having allowed such an obvious
bit of plagiarism to reach its editori-

al page. A

Wet lament

I can tolerate the snow, live with
the cold and keep grinning despite
the cloudy skies, but the slush on the
sidewalks and in the streets is really
getting on my nerves. After each
snowstorm, thousands of Pitt stu-
dents and I have to plod through the
filthy slosh on their way to classes,
sick of soaking socks and soggy
sneakers.

To resolve this slushy problem,
here are a few suggestions as to what

' we can do to get rid of the slush:

OGet everyone living in the Tow-
ers and Quad to evaporate the slush
with their hairdryers.

0Send it offto Washington, D.C.,
where it will get lost in the
bureaucracy.

0Closer to home, send it to the
university administration offices in
Thackeray where it will get lost in
the bureaucracy.

0Serve it with fish in the Towers
cafeteria. (Since they do ' this
already, however, we move on to the
next best suggestionz)

OServe it with fish in CMU’s
cafeteria. -

0Have Coach Fazio get his team
to shove] the stuff away. This will
then give the football team a sense of
accomplishment for this school
year.

0Ship it off to the starving in Ethi-
opia. (I know: cruel, cruel, cruel  )

0Mail it to Premier Chernenko as
a get-well gift.

0Donate it to the Pitt theater
department as a stage prop. .

0Bury nuclear waste underneath
it.

OFill the Trees Hall pool with it.

0Use it ‘to solve the deficit. (Don’t
ask me how — Reagan is the man
with the answers.)

0Have pharmacy students present
it to President Posvar as a token of
their admiration. .

And these suggestions made by
the guys on my dorm floor:
_ 0Sell it at a price that will move!

0Feed it to those who complain
about it!

Adam Eisenstat 8c Craig Mullen: Bloomsburg Diary

page 5

Last weekend, Craig and I were
given the chance to vacate this tired
burg by virtue of our victory in the
Pitt College Bowl Tournament last
November (College Bowl is a high-
brow form ofTrivial Pursuit).

We, along with the two other
members of our team and the
winners of various other tourna-
ments (pool, ping-pong, etc.), piled
into a van early Friday morning for
an all-expense (well, almost) paid
trip to the ACIU regionals at
Bloomsburg State College in
Bloomsburg, Pa., the Babylon of
northeast Pennsylvania. Here fol-
lows the gripping account of that
journey, complete with the thrill of
victory, the agony of defeat and the
drudgery of waiting hours and hours
for a meager shot at hollow glory.

Feb. 15, 6:30 a.m.: The bards shall
junket. The van leaves Craig and me
prep for a surreal good time. Our
broken dialogue, random cruelty,
ﬂoating literary salvos and epipha-
nies continue nonstop for about five
hours. We reached new heights of
meaninglessness on that trek
through the concrete blah of the
Pennsylvania Turnpike.

Bloomsburg State College creeps
up on us. We debark with fervor and
predictably head for the nearest
john. Our first observation about
this quaint little bead of sweat in the
armpit of academia comes from
Craig, who loudly marvelsat the
conspicuous lack of homosexual
graffiti on the bathroom walls, vis-a-
vis our own Pitt where this is the
norm.

After a holy trio of pitchers at the
local bar (one of only three) on Main
Street (no lie), we head back to the
student union where we were told to
convene at 3 p.m. sharp. Well, our
match wasn’t until 7:30 and we were
being primed for a weekend of wait-
ing, donuts, waiting, coffee and
more waiting. To kill time, Craig
and another member of our team
quiz each other relentlessly for
about an hour and a half, to the

And this final comment from an
anonymous critic:

“You ignorant [deleted]  if you
can’t take the weather that gives
Pittsburgh its characteristic flavor,
why don’t yougo to Bhopal and
breathe their $&3*!.!”

Anyone with serious problems
coping with slush should hide under-
neath their dorm room beds until
finals, when it should be replaced by
trained attack-water sprinkler
systems.

amazement and disgust of a dozen
or so stiff and humorless players
from other teams.

After that, Craig and I mistakenly
caught a match between George-’
town and another school. What we
saw completely toppled our hopes of
winning the whole thing. George-
town's team (Pat Ewing wasn’t
there, I'm told, due to other commit-
ments) was like a quartet of comput-
ers. They just couldn’t miss. They
were all lanky, serious and dressed in
argyle garments.

“That’s all right,” Craig said in a
tone of resignation, “they have to go

through the rest of their lives being .

them.” He later said that seeing
Georgetown reaffirmed his faith in
private education.

Our first match was against IUP,
who never even showed up, so we
won by forfeit. Just to stay honest,
we played a practice game against a
motley crew of different schools.

Before each match, there was a
period of inactivity when we just sat
at our tables, which were on the plat-
form at the head of a large room. On
the table in front ofus sat two micro-
phones and four lights that came on
and rang when you pushed the but-
ton connected to it. In the lull before
our first match, I softly hummed
early '70s pop songs into the mike,
like “You Sexy Thing” and “Chero-
kee Nation.” The moderator, a
genial and dignified fellow, gently

reprimanded me. All I could say’

was, “I’m a born entertainer. Put me

, in front of a microphone, and I have

to perform."

We lost the pickup game and IUP
showed up a while later, begging for
a reprieve. After an hour and a half
of hemming and hawing, the forfeit
was made official and we fled the

‘ student union. Six hours of nonstop

tedium and we had to unwind.

We ended up at a frat party that
night and were, amazingly enough,
treated decently and invited to stay
the night (our hotel was I0 miles
away). This “party” reminded me of
the hull of a slave ship — literally

packed wall-to-wall with people.
Craig said it was like “Satyracon.“
Sometimes a frat titan would guzzle
from a large funnel of beer (they
called them beer bongs), while eve-
ryone hooted and yelled. I got into
the act and screamed at the top of
my lungs, “Drink, drink, DRINK,
DRINK!” There’s a mindless slob in
all of us.

Craig was taken aback by the total
lack of hostility and overt revulsion
these people, who were diametri-
cally opposed to us in most ways,
exhibited — that is, after they found
out he wasn’t an LCB agent. Our
host gave us towels and beer and, the
next afternoon at the STP (Saturday
tuneup party), he gave us more beer,
food and unlimited access to his tape
collection. They were civil party
animals, a species I’d always thought
nonexistent.

We played three matches the next
day. Before one match, I said sternly
into the mike: “Who did you know
and when did you know them? Are
you now or have you ever been a
member of the Communist Party?”
The moderator said that I was now
regressing to history.

At any rate, we lost two of three
and were eliminated. Craig and I
were distressed for maybe five min-
utes, but our other teammates, both
steely-eyed competitors, had come
to win and complained to others
about our failures and. shortcom-
ings. Although decent fellows, we
dismissed them as anal retentives —
flat and simple. They weren’t at any
of the parties at which we were, if
they were at any at all.

Anal retentives. They should have
been subs for Georgetown.

That night, there was a_banquet.
Everyone wore nametags —- Craig

was Witold Gombrowitz and I was

Jersey Joe Dionysus. The meal was
efficient and mediocre, like all ban-
quet fare. The tournament honchos
were mercifully brief in their podium
posturing but still managed to scale
new heights of self-congratulation.
We went back to the frat and soon

sensed a strong air of discontent
with our presence. It's a practiced
art, knowing when you’ve over-
stayed your welcome. Vamoose we
did. Lehigh’s college bowl team was
having a party at a hotel near ours,
so that's where we headed.

Two farm boys gave us a ride,
which required them to go miles out
of their way. (What had we done to
deserve this pa_ll of decency?) Four

of us in an open pickup truck going «

75 mph was our ride. Shades of
Kerouac.

They dropped us off about three
miles from the motel strip, so we
walked the distance, with Craig
spewing reams of obscure poetry he
had memorized just for the occa-
sion. We milked the Lehigh party for
all it could offer, Craig spending the
majority of the time attempting to
choke some girl with his formidable
knowledge of 19th century French
literature. -

Sunday: We had a go at a buffet
brunch, courtesy. of Bloomsburg
College. Craig, with his ever‘-keen
sense of theater, noticed roving eyes
directed at him, so he created a
minor spectacle by playing human-
trough-drama with a dozen pan-
cakes spread thick-with mustard,
ketchup, cottage cheese and syrup.
He ate them all, y’know.

Next stop: P-Nut Bowl, where we

put in a good two hours waiting for

We tasted glory when we were vic- _

weaken with indifference). We
tasted defeat at Bloomsburg, and
still no one cared. ,

Well, that’s all right. We competi-

Thatcher uses ’

prompter

WASHINGTON (UPI) —
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher used a teleprompter
Tuesday when she gave her
speech to Congress.

Thatcher did not appear to be
entirely comfortable with the
new-fangled device, which
allows a speaker to look directly
at an audience while seeing a
reflection of his or her notes.

President Reagan made a
strong impression on British
Parliamentarians when he used a
teleprompter during a visit to
England two years ago.

Thatcher said, however, that
when she recently used the device
to speak to the Conservative
Party, there was such a strong
light behind her that she could
not see her notes.

So, Thatcher said, she always
carries an extra copy of her
speech — just in case.

Fed to halt
inﬂation

WASHINGTON (UPI) -
Federal Reserve chairman Paul
Volcker went before the Senate
Banking Committee Tuesday to
say he'll do all that’s in his power
to keep inﬂation and interest
rates where they are.

However, he told the Senators
that unless Congress gets a han-
dle on deﬁcits, all bets are off.

Volcker said the Federal
Reserve will let the basic money
supply figure, known as Ml,
grow within a four- to seven-
percent range this year, which

was the previous target.

The expansion is based on the
idea of Congress trimming $50
billion from the budget deficit. If
that doesn’t go according to
plan, Volcker said the country
will face “some very real
problems.”

Volcker also delivered the
Federal Reserve‘s annual" eco-
nomic report to Congress
yesterday.

The report said that the econ-
omy is growing by three and one-
half to four percent this year,
once the inﬂation is figured out.
That’s close to the figures pro-
duced by the administration and
the non-partisan congressional
budget office.

Asbestos still in
schools

BEAUMONT, Texas (UPI)
— Twenty-three makers of
asbestos will be in federal court
this fall, facing a lawsuit filed in
Beaumont, Texas.

The $120-million lawsuit is
from 76 school districts in Texas,
including those in Dallas, Hous-
ton, Fort Worth and San
Antonio. ‘

Attorney Martin Dies said the
school disticts want the compan-
ies to remove any remaining
asbestos from their buildings and
be held liable for any future law-
suits filed by students or
personnel.

Asbestos has been linked to a
variety of lung ailments and pos-
sibly linked to cancer.

The $120-million figure is
what the districts have spent, and
will spend, to remove the hazard-
ous materials from schools. The

In Brief

lawsuit claims that the compan-
ies knew asbestos caused health
problems when they sold it to
builders in the ’50s and ’60s. The
trial will start in November.

Refugees sent
back to Cuba H

A‘ (UPI) —- Twenty-three
Cuban refugees are on their way
by chartered jet back to Havana.
They are the first of the 2,700 the
Reagan administration wants to
be deported. A federal appeals
court cleared the way for their
departure yesterday, and they
left a Georgia air force base
shortly afterward. Most of the
Cubans facing deportation have
already been convicted of crimes
in Cuba. ’

Farmers suffer

WASHINGTON (UPI) —
The nation’s farmers want the
country to know they’re mad,
and they’ll use what they can to
get some financial relief, even if it
angers the White House.

Farm-belt.Senators did just
that yesterday by launching a fil-
ibuster against Edwin Meese’s
nomination for attorney general.
The senators began the stalling
tactic yesterday afternoon in an
effort to pressure Congress to
bail farmers out of ‘an intense
debt crisis.

At last report, Democrat
David Boren of Oklahoma was
on the Senate floor, planning to
read through an entire 385-page
report on Meese. The report is

from a special prosecutor who
cleared Meese of criminal
wrongdoing.

President Reagan told report-
ers that he thinks the filibuster is
“ridiculous.”

Senate Republican leader
Robert Dole called it “black-
mail.” The Kansas Republican
said he’ll keep the Senate in ses-
sion through Saturday, if that's
what it takes to bring the Meese
nomination to a vote.

Boren, however, said the farm .
crisis needs immediate attention
or “I3 to 15 percent of the
nation’s farmers will go out of
business this year.”

Meese deal
tentative

WASHINGTON (UPI) —
Farm belt senators reached a ten-
tative agreement early yesterday
afternoon on a plan to help debt-
stricken farmers. But last night
they said the deal was “unravel-
ing" and they would not end a
filibuster of Edwin Meese’s nom-
ination for attorney general until
it is worked out. Senate Republi-
can leader Robert Dole said he
still hoped to pull the deal
through last night and bring
Meese’s long-awaited confirma-
tion to a vote.

Pooch caught
between worlds

BERLIN (UPI) —— For two
days, a tiny, lost cocker spaniel
stood in the freezing cold and
barked mournfully in a cold war

no-man‘s land between the old
and new sections of the Berlin
Wall. West Berliners could not
get to the puppy because it was in
East German territory, and the
East Germans apparently did not
know the puppy was there. After
two days of shivering, the dog
finally was rescued yesterday by
the East Germans.

TMI restart

WASHINGTON (UPI) ——
A Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion (NRC) licensing appeal
board must review the refusal of
an administrative law judge to
step down in the Three Mile
Island restart hearings. Ivan
Smith rejected requests from
Pennsylvania state officials and
anti-nuclear groups to disqualify
himself. Smith had asked a fed-
eral judge to be lenient in sen-
tencing a TMI reactor operator
who cheated on an NRC test.

TMI meltdown

MIDDLETOWN, Pa.

(UPI) — Researchers say a
nuclear fuel meltdown occurred
at Three Mile Island during the
l979 accident. A U.S. govern-
ment contractor said new studies
show that the ultra-hot uranium
dioxide was cooled and trapped
inside the‘ reactor. In a related
but separate announcement yes-
terday, the operator of TMI said
that a massive pile of fist-sized
rocks, likely composed in part of
the once-molten fuel, have been
found at the base ofthe damaged ‘
reactor.

“““‘s1ioxi}’cét§e,t1-"ﬁday,ti1+'ei§r’iiai~§:”Z2, 1985

Rain Parade’s singer and lead guitarist, Ali/Iatt Piucci

by Carrie Stetler

"One of the greatest experiences of
my life was watching Roger
McGuinn's head float off of his body
' “J ' --~—- —.-LA- I ...-n 1/1 ”
recalled Matt Piucci, lead singer of
L.A.’s Rain Parade. He was just
another kid experimenting with hal-
lucinogens and listening to "Eight

,Miles High,” doing both in the early
' '70s. By the mid '70s, though, it

wasn't cool to do either anymore.
Unlike,most young idealists who
saw the demise of the hippie era,

‘Piucci never lost his love of '60s rock

and mind expansion — he tried to
make a career out of them. Today, the
Rain Parade is at the forefront of an
ever-growing multitude of so-called
"neopsychedelic" bands.

Neopsychedelia: a rock critic term
for a trend in new music which
harkens to mind the jangly guitars
and close harmonies of mid '60s pop
rock.

Somewhere along the road to
maturity, Piucci discovered that "you
don't need drugs to get tothose other
places [the subconscious mind]/’ He
stopped taking them all the time and

decided to attend the University of
Minnesota, majoring in biochemis-
try. The passion for science was fleet-
ing, however, and Piucci left
academia to form his first band, the
Rm+nirkc: OF the Beatnicks he now
says: "Our entire repertoire con-
sisted of the Modern Lovers’ first
album, some Stooges and some
Velvet Underground. We had no
originals; we were terrible." He
wouldn't even mention his second
band because "it sucked."

The Rain Parade was formed three
years ago, born in a process that,
when recounted, involves the names
of brothers, friends of brothers and
friends of friends in several different
towns from Chicago to Los Angeles.
A few members have marched in and
out of the Rain Parade since its incep-
tion, but the current lineup consists
of bassist Steve Roback, guitarist
John Thoman, organist/violinist Will
Glenn and drummer Mark Marcum.
Marcum is the latest member to join
the band after a succession of
drummers left, claiming that the Rain
Parade’s moody, tuneful melodies
were ”too wimpy.”

"That's because we don't reject pop

music,” Piucci explained. ”We love
rock ’n’roll and the freedom it stands
for, but you don't have to be raw to be
good. Originally, we just set out to
play pretty orchestrated music and
that's what we're doing.”

"We want to do something that

creates an escape from the mundan-
ity of daily life," added bassist
Roback, ”a place where people can go
 like watching TV."

This striving for other-worldliness
probably had something to do with
the name of the Rain Parade’s first lp,
Emergency Third Rail Power Trip. While
relatively free of the guitar distortion
and freakout lyrics that you might
expect from such a title, the album
still sounds a trifle spacey and, inevit-
ably, they could not stop themselves
from being associated with the ”Pais-
ley Underground.”

Paisley Underground: rock critic
term used to describe "neopsyche-
delic" bands and the appearance of
love beads and bowl hair cuts on
album covers. (Note: ' Rain Parade
members don't wear love beads and
their hairstyles are boringly
timeless.)

Like most victims of the "neopsy-

in g a new twist on an old trip

chedelic," ”Paisley Underground"
tag, Rain Parade denies that it is
deliberately trying to recreate a cer-
tain '60s sound. It does admit, how-
ever, that a few '60s and early '70s
bands —— Buffalo Springfield in par-
ticular — have been influential. ~
”It’s like this soup," commented
Piucci, indicating a bowl of mines-
trone he was eating during the inter-
view. "Here on the table it's soup, but
in my stomach it's no longer soup."
Frustrated by labels and compari-
sons to past and present groups,
Piucci attempted to put this whole
'60s revival thing into perspective.
"As I see it," he said, ”there are two,
perhaps three, separate phenomena.
First, there are several L.A. bands like
the Bangles and Green on Red who
we're always being lumped with.
That's one thing, just a bunch of
bands that came out of the same area
and played in the same clubs. I think
that's ridiculous. The Ramones and
the Talking Heads came from the
same place and they were a part of the
whole CBGB's thing, but are they
alike? No. Phenomenon B is the

whole 'paisley' thing — which is just

the glasses, the hair, dressing up like
Paul Revere and the Raiders, and
that's fun but  "
"To those people we're like Mat-
tel's new toy," complained Roback.
”The third thing,” Piucci con-

tinued, ”is that there is an enormous ~

amount of good, original non-major
label music being produced in Amer-
ica today. A lot of those smaller bands
represent the same kind of thinking
we represent. But it's hard doing this
now. In the '70s we had disco and
people rejected it, and then it came
right back again/'~ P

Eventually, Piucci predicted, people
will get sick of i’well—crafted dance
music" (a rock critic term for a trend
that gets more airplay than neopsy—
chedelia). When they've had enough
of Duran Duran and Culture Club,
audiences will start seeking‘ the
freshness and creativity to be found
on smaller labels.

While Piucci made token Boy
George jokes, the rest of the band
reminded him that it's time to head
over to Eide's Record Store and auto-
graph some promotional posters for
Explosions in the Glass House, the Rain
Parade’s latest album. On the way
out, Roback mentioned that after the
Rain Parade finishes its U.S. tour,
they'll be going to Europe, where
their album is selling well. They may
possibly tour Japan as well, where
there is probably no translation of
Emergency Third Rail Power Trip —— and
hopefully, no translation for "Paisley
Underground," either.

by Leslie M. Bennett

"  for the letter of the law killeth, but
the spirit giveth life."
' --II Corinthians 3:6

It's a dirty job, but Someone’s got to
do it. Someone’s got to make laws,
Someone’s got to uphold them  and
Someone’s got to break them.

More than anything else, Jean
Anouilh's modern interpretation of
the Sophoclean tragedy, /lntigone,
articulates the conflict between pub-
lic authority and personal conviction.

”But why must dirty work be
done?” asks Antigone, the antagonis-
tic protagonist in Studio Theatre's
recent production. This daughter of
Oedipus comes from a tribe that asks
questions and asks them to the bitter
end. And if that is her fatal flaw, then
Creon’s failing is doubly tragic.

Creon is the king of Thebes whose
”dirty work" it is to make decisions
and back them up with force. As the
play opens, he has just forbidden, by
public decree, a proper burial for
Antigone's dead brother, Polynices.
Instead, the body is to be left to the
ravages of nature —— a ghastly fate for
an ancient Greek, since it was
believed that the soul of an unburied
body could not be delivered safely to
its eternal abode. A tragedy of wills is
immediately established in Anti-
gone's supreme determination .to
uphold family honor rather than
state rule.

strong impressiveness is cause
enough to look forward to student
productions in the future.

Earl D. Childs’ performance as
Creon is nothing short of superb.

The part is undoubtedly the most
demanding and stimulating in the
play. In a particularly effective scene
where the confrontation between
Antigone and Creon builds toward
the tragic climax, Childs’ portrayal is
as unfailing as Creon’s will is uncom-

promising. We clearly see, through}

the strength of Childs’ acting, the
king's refusal to admit weakness.
Tammy Bouzos, in the role of Anti-
gone, carries her own share of the
weight in this scene with sure and
steady balance. As Antigone's sincere
and relentless reasoning crashes
against the king's unyielding sense of
wisdom, we see Creon at his most
vulnerable moments. Childs subtly
dramatizes the point by taking off,
piece by piece, some of his clothing, as
if literally being stripped of his
power. When the king's sophistic
arguments lose their legitimacy in
relation to Antigone's moral cause,
his stacks of scholastic books are scat-
tered in symbolic destruction.
Potter's clay, sculpting tools and an
unfinished bust provide other clever

use of props, allowing us to look~

further into Creon’s thoughts and
motivations as he struggles in his rul-
ing position. Childs mixes gestures of
ambition and frustration to create a
convincing image of a failing king.

Several devices are used through- I

out the play to continually remind the
audience of the ominous threat of
tragedy. Three key figures remain on

 

and the law Won

stage in nearly every scene, deepen-
ing this sense of awareness. The
Chorus figure in particular, played by
Vikki Herd, steps in frequently to
further instruct the audience's
response. '
The remaining cast of 12 all per-
form more than competently.‘Kim
Veruggio is Antigone's sister,

Antigone comes
from a tribe that asks
questions, and asks
them to the hitterend.
/ind ifthatis herfatal
flaw, then Creon’s
failing is doubly
tragic. .. - ~

Ismene, who discourages the rash
irresponsibility she sees in Anti-
gone's decision to break the law.
Though the play is heavily somber,
Robert Ewing provides welcome
moments of comic relief in his role as
a boisterous guard. His 20th- century
language and mannerisms may seem
a bit out of place in a production
which is otherwise set inancient
Greece, but the inconsistency may
merely suggest the timelessness of
Antigone's theme.

NEW DAY RISING’
Husker Du
SST

Husker Du, now finished rid-
ing the wave of critical acclaim
that followed last year's Zen
Arcade, have released yet
another thrashingly passionate
album: New Day Rising. While it
probably won't break the band
into the mainstream, it will
further expand the boundaries
of hardcore.

Their biggest breakthrough
here is a new found pop sensibil-
ity. It is most apparent in the
sexually frustrated "I Apolo-
gize” and the '50s-style rocker
about a sci-fi fanatic entitled
”Books About UFOs." Although
this emerging sound is more
melodic than most" of their pre-
vious work, it still has that
Husker Du edge. The rough
sound is aided through endless
distortion and a lack of serious
production work.

While all 15 songs on New Day
Rising are performed with equal

Chris Isaak
Warner Bros.

Chris Isaak has certainly seen
the inception of rock ’n’ roll and
knows that his name was Elvis
Presley: Altheagh eeeasienally
sidetracked —- particularly on
side one -- by ethereal 19805
mood music, Isaak sets out to
recreate the original sound of
rock ’n’ roll full of sparse,
twangy guitars, a simple, steady

rhythm and lots of cornball lyr-
ics that shed little light on the
frustrations of romance.
Imagine a boy, imagine a girI/lma-
gine the hearts that are broken by
world, Isaak croons in ”Talk to
Me," borrowing liberally from
Elvis’ quivering lower register
almost to the point of forgery

Rise and shine

intensity, the material is
extremely varied. ”The Girl
Who Lives on Heaven Hill,” for
example, is a typically ambigu-
ous heavy metal love song,
which is, however begrudg-
ingly, hard to dislike.

There are also a number of
songs reminiscent of Zen Arcade
such as ”Terms of Psychic War-
fare” and ’’I Don't Know What
You're Talking About” which
seem to cry out with
frustration.

The last song on the album,
”Plans I Make,” if you can call it
a song, degenerates into some
sort of industrial noise that is
reminiscent only of a garbage
can crashing down a flight of
steps.

No, New Day Rising is not the
most accessible record around,
but it is one of the most worth-
while. This, like its predecessor
has given hardcore a new
dimension. It seems that there is
indeed a new day rising for
Husker Du and, with luck, oth-
ers will listen and wake up.

MICHAEL FAY
% tion that taints the record

throughout.

To further complicate mat-
ters, Isaak lacks a cohesive band
behind him. Only guitarist
James Calvin Wilsey is credited
with permanent status. Many
groups create an interesting
sound with limited instrumen-
tation, but few of the musical
ideas on Silvertone are new, and
their treatments generally pale
in comparison to their
predecessors.

Eclecticism hardly qualifies as
art when it merely traces the
outlines of rock ’n’ roll arche-
types. This guy even manages
to look like Elvis. No one will
improve the music of Elvis Pres-
ley and Carl Perkins, but their
work has been built upon and
had new life breathed into it.

Chris Isaak, with his austere
musicianship, sappy tales of
love’s lost-and-found depart-
ment and derivative vocal ploys,

JOHN PARR
John Parr
Atlantic

Backed to the hilt by ex-Who
manager John Wolf, British
rocker John Parr has made a
dashing foray into the Ameri-
can pop-metal market, blown
wide open last year by Van
Halen. This debut lp is peppered
with some palatable, hard-
edged moments and is bloated
with fine production, but ulti-
mately suffers the effects of a
lyrical famine.

All nine songs deal with varia-
tions on s:z’:w~_ialit},' (no surprise,

pains of thinking on the most
sexist level.

”Naughty Naughty" is inter-
esting insofar as it uses studio
gimmickry, but the album's
high points are definitely ”She’s
Gonna Love You to Death” and
”Somebody Stole My Thunder.”
Both songs are AM/FM-styled
tunes with hooky refrains that
should pass through the sieves
of radio programmers clue to
their simplicity. One is able to
grasp the entire statement of
the songs after hearing the first
line of each chorus, leaving no
apparent reason to follow the
verses.

For the audience that this
album is obviously aimed at
reaching, ]ohn Parr succeeds at
playing on the single-
mindedness -that we hope all
adolescents will eventually
grow out of. They usually do.

WARMING UP TO THE ICE
AGE

John Hiatt

Geffen

There are moments on Warm-
ing Up To The Ice Age when John
Hiatt comes across as a sort of
macho Elvis Costello. This asso-
ciation partially arises from the
fact that Costello himself sings
a duet with Hiatt on the ballad
”Living Just a Little, Laughing
Just a Little.”

But even if Elvis had nothing
to do with this album, a small
degree of comparison would be
inevitable. Take a song title like
”Number One Honest Game,"
add snatches of r&b organ play-
ing, a calypso beat and lyrics like
The Ace of Spades is walking on the

This fleeting similarity to the
bitter-but-polite Elvis is the
exception rather than the rule
on Warming Up To The Ice Age,
Hiatt's second release. The
bluesy guitar hooks and gruff
vocals on cuts like ”The Usual"
establish Hiatt as a kind of ironic
ladies’ man hanging out in bars,
getting teased by cold-hearted
women and belting down the
same drink.

Horns, funky bass lines and
soulful harmonies account for
the warmth on Ice Age,and Hiatt
endows his earthy witticisms
with an appropriately gritty
delivery, but something pre-
vents this album from cooking
in the way that slick rhythm and
blues like this is supposed to.
Maybe songs like ”I’m a Man”
and ”I Got a Gun” are a little too
predictably "low down and
dirty.” Maybe if the production
weren't so clean, it wouldn't be
necessary to put the phrase
”low down and dirty” in quota-
tions when applying it to Hiatt.

On Warming Up To The Ice Age,
Hiatt has found a nice middle
ground between raunch and
lighthearted funk. It's a pleasant
climate, but not quite hot
enough.

A woman possessed

by Michael Selz

It's unusual for a love story to be
eclipsed by its atmosphere. Usually,

..it's the emotion, the dialogue or the

 
 
 

characters’ intensity that makes a
love story riveting. Not so with Mrs.
Soffel. This film is so rigidly atmos-
pheric that some viewers have com-
plained that they couldn’t see well
enough to know whether or not they
liked it.

The story is simple enough. In the
summer of 1901, Ed and Jack Biddle
(Mel Gibson and Matthew Modine)
were sentenced to hang for the
murder of a grocery clerk, killed dur-
ing an attempted burglary. Impris-
oned in the death row of Allegheny
County Jail, they drew the sympathy
and protest of "many Pittsburghers, a
‘lot of them women. Less than two
months before their scheduled exe-
cution, they escaped the jail, freed by

the warden’s wife, Kate Soffel.

On the surface, Mrs. Soffel was the
embodiment of Victorian restraint
and denial. Literally living in the pris-
on (in the warden’s residence that
was vacated only in 1980), she was a
dutiful wife and mother. After recov-
ering from a three-month illness, she
began patrolling the prison, giving
Bibles and words of Christian com-
fort to the inmates. Her frequent vis-
its to the Biddle brothers became less
evangelical and more passionate in
nature as Ed Biddle worked on her,

/seducing her. Swept up with passion,

she delivered files to saw the Biddles’
prison bars and candle wax to hold
the bars back in place.

The story is provocative on two
counts. Kate Soffel gave up every-
thing in her world to aid and then join
these two men in their escape. Ed Bid-
dle was transformed from a manipu-
lating opportunist to a doomed lover
by refusing to leave without her and
so he impaired his chances for reach-
ing Canada, their proposed refuge.

We all know about the darkness-at-
noon period of Pittsburgh's history.
Mrs. Soffel is relentlessly dark. The
prison is a gloomy maze of passage-
ways and bars, relieved only by a
seven-story atrium. .Grime covers
the floors, the walls, the prisoners’
faces.There is a never-ending, never-
explained clanking of metal — dully
beating, evoking an air of labor or
industry. »

Equally dark, but warm and luxuri-
ant iﬁ its Victorian clutter, is the Sof-
fels’ residence. Here at least, the
Soffel children inject a little levity
into the grim chain of events (”Mom,
you know they had to pick the gro-
cer’s brains off the wall.7").

Outside the prison, the streets are
snowblown and dark, no matter what

"time of day. Pittsburgh residents

seem to favor clothes of black, grey or
dark green. Mrs. Soffel herself is pal-
lid and worn, her face all circles and
lines except for her sparkling eyes.
What's amazing is how the feel of
the film changes with the Biddles’
escape. Kate Soffel becomes flushed

 

 

 

Diane Keaton and Mel Gib son star in Mrs. Soffel.

with exhilaration and sex, her
unwrapped hair flying about. As she
is transformed, so is the landscape.
Snow-covered terrain, bright with
sunlight, flashes past them as they
ride a horse-drawn sleigh. Giddy and
giggly with freedom, she talks lightly
of the $5,000 on their heads: ”We just
won't let anyone collect that, will
we?" The soundtrack obliges their
exuberance with panpipes and auto-
harp, sleighbells and harpsichord. It
hurts that they're doomed. '

Diane Keaton shows range and
subtlety. She's matured since the
clumsy nervousness of Annie Hall.
.She doesn't merely cross over a bar-
rier into illicit love and stay there. She
vacillates. After Ed kisses her for the
firsttime, she runs to her apartment
and washes her mouth, but then
chuckles.

Mel Gibson's Ed Biddle is impossi-

bly both arrogant and humble. He
gazes warmly at Kate Soffel and
strikes responsive long-silenced
chords in her. ”You live here. You
know what it is to live here,” he says,
pulling them together in their desola-
tion. In one scene, you can feel that
although he is manipulating her, he
finds at the same time that his emo-
tions aren't feigned. ”What do you

want from me? Why do you come _

here?” he shouts, and pulls her hand
through the bars to his neck, implor-
ing her to feel the beat of life in him.

Gillian Armstrong's first Ameri-
can film succeeds on every level. It is
arresting, beautiful to look at and
exceptionally well-acted by profes-
sionals who just keep getting better.
It's a story of true love set in Pitts-
burgh. No romantic problem will

seem insurmountable after this one, I '

promise you.

The Breakfast Club finds common ground

by Mark Milovats '

Before the day was over, they
broke the rules, baring their souls in a
way they never dreamed possible.

No, it's not a new porn movie.
Rather, it's a comical, heartwarming,
true-to-life story of five total
strangers — a brain, a beauty, a jock,
a rebel and a recluse — with nothing
in‘ common, meeting for the first
time. 1

The Breakfast Club, which stars Ally
Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Anthony
Hall, Judd Nelson and Molly Ring-
wald, is filmed almost entirely in a
high school library.

On a cold, bleak winter morning,
these five students from an upper-
middle-class suburb of Chicago
arrive at Shermer High School to
spend the entire day —— from 7 a.m. to
4 p.m. — serving detention.

During the course of the day, these

five strangers who seem to have little
in common come to learn that they
share more than they first realized.
Not only do they come to learn a
great deal about each other, but ulti-
ma tely they come to learn a great deal
about themselves.

Emilio Estevez plays Andy Clark,
the handsome star wrestler who
sports his letterman's jacket with
athletic ease. In appearance, Andy is
the stereotypical jock, but we find out
later in the movie that his cool, stone-
faced image is an image. In truth, he's
living his high school years to please
his father and not for self-enjoyment.
As Andy, Estevez is an impressive
figure onscreen, sure to make any
high school girl flip.

Molly Ringwald as Claire Standish,
a budding beauty who is much too.
sophisticated for her age, is enough
to make any boyish heart skip a beat.
Very popular and very rich, Claire is
an object of envy. Ringwald seems to

easily fit the part of a seemingly pru-
dent, pure girl set out on a mission to
tease every male that comes near her.

Anthony Michael Hall plays Brian
Johnson, the exemplary straight-A
student and the immediate object of
the group's scorn. Hall, who gives the
most honest impression of caring for
his fellow detention mates and whose
voice opens and closes the film, gives
the aura of being born to act.

Judd Nelson'is John Bender, the
punk from the wrong side of the
tracks. His blatant contempt for eve-
ryone and everything stems from a
torrid home life. Bender gives the
group and the movie leadership and a
focal point. As Bender, Nelson is a
moving and polished actor who relies
on his cockiness to draw emotion
from the audience.

Ally Sheedy plays Allison Rey-
nolds, a painfully withdrawn, seem-
ingly crazy student whose parents,
she claims, ignore her. Her perfor-

mance gives» the movie that extra
touch of erratic humor that occasion-
ally makes you want to chuckle.

We've all been ignored at one time
or another, much the same way as
each of these ‘characters have been.
And that's what makes this movie so
good: It allows the audience to parti-
cipate and reminisce with these five
students.

The Breakfast Club is an entertaining
opportunity to slip back to your high
school days —— assuming you want to,
of course. Directed, screenwritten
and produced by John Hughes (Sixteen
Candles), The Breakfast Club definitely
shows his ability to turn out good
films.

If you're in the mood to be enter-
tained and can afford the rising costs
of movies, by all means see The Break-
fast Club. You'll find out that "Each

one of us is a brain, and an athlete, a"

basket case, a princess and a
criminal."

itt women, 68-67

By Michael Bertonaschi
The Pitt News - i

The Pitt women’s basketball team
(15-l 1) took on the St. John’s
Express at Alumni Hall on Wednes-
day evening and lost 68-67.

Anyone visiting St. John’s Uni-
versity campus on a mild February
afternoon immediately notices two
things: Fourteen out of 15 cab driv-
ers in New York City do not know
where the campus is, and once on
campus, the infamous Louie Carne-
secca sweater is all the rage. A cheap
copy of the sweater in T-shirt form
sells for $12.50 at the campus book-
store. ’

On Jan. 19 at the ﬁeld house, St.
John’s defeated Pitt 73-67 behind
seniors Barbara Rapp and Faye
Gerald, who combined for 32 points
and eight rebounds. Rapp and
Gerald were recently dismissed from
the team for disciplinary reasons
and will not return. Both were key
players in the St. J ohn’s attack, and
their loss would seem to spell doom
for the Express.

Not so, according to assistant
coach Kerry Phayre: “We’re playing
more like a team now. The kids that
hadn’t been playing much have
come through, and we have a better
atmosphere among the players.”

The first half of the game was a
seesaw battle. From the opening tap,
both teams came out playing hard
and with 4:54 to go, the score was
tied at 27. For the remainder of the‘
half, the Lady Panthers took control
and outscored St. John’s 12 to four,
to take a 39-31 lead into the locker
room.

Pitt was led by All-America can-
didate Jennifer Bruce with 14 points.
St. J ohn’s small front line could not
control Bruce, and it looked like she
would be in for another big night.
Bruce got help from Kim Gannis,

Sports  

St. John’s nips

who came in off the bench to score
eight points. Gannis was used exten-
sivelyvin the first half, due to the
absence from the Panther offense of
starting guards Lisa Fubio and Kim
Tirik. The two combined for only
four points in the first half. St.
John’s got eight points from Jan
Burgess and six from Althea Yard
and Jackie Smith.

St. John’s opened the second half
using a full-court zone press, and
immediately the Panthers lost their
poise and the lead. With 15:25 to
play in the game, Jackie Smith con-
verted on a three-point play to give
the Express a 42-41 lead.

On the strength of their full-court

pressure and a matchup half-court‘

defense, St. John’s outscored Pitt
11-2 in the first five minutes of the
second half. “They played a match-
up zone, and we don't know how to
break the matchup zones,” com-
plained head coach Judy Saurer.

St. John’s also closed off the
inside on Jennifer Bruce, who could
not get free. “They were packing it in
pretty well," said Tirik. “They were
playing a matchup zone, and they
were following her around all over.”

With Bruce shut off on the inside,
Pitt’s “other” forward, senior Ellen
Gilhooley, rose to the occasion. Gil-
hooley, who had only two points in
the first half, scored 12 in the ﬁnal 15
minutes to keep pace with the
Express.

There were 16 seconds remaining
in the game when Lisa Fubio fouled
Janet Roos. Roos converted both
free throws to pull St. John’s to
within one at 67-66. St. John’s head
coach Joe Mullaney Jr. called a
time-out after the second free throw.

When play resumed, the Panthers
inbounded the ball and Tirik was

fouled by Burgess. Tirik’s ﬁrst shot
hit the back of the rim and bounced
out. Bruce and Yard went for the
rebound. Bruce, realizing that she
could not grab it, got one hand on it
and_ slammed it down. Tirik then
grabbed it when it bounced back to
the foul line.

As Tirik controlled the ball and
turned to pass, the officials called
Tirik for pushing off on the play,
sending Smith to the free throw line
with seven seconds remaining.

“I thought I had a clean rebound,”
said Tirik. “There wasn't anyone
within five feet of me, and I turned
around and about two seconds later,
the ref called a foul."

“I thought it was an unfair call at
that point,” said Saurer. “I thought

we had a rebound. I didn’t see her
swinging any elbow.”

Smith, who happens to be an 86-
percent free throw shooter, stepped
to the line and calmly sank both to
give St. John’s a 68-67 lead. With
seven seconds remaining, Pitt
inbounded the ball and called time
out. There was now only four
seconds _left in the game.

Stephanie Collins, whose last-
second shot had beated Boston Col-
lege in January, entered the game to
try and duplicate the heroics. While
inbounding the ball, Tirik saw that

Collins was covered so she threw it

in to Lisa Fubio. Fubio’s shot was
no good, and during the scramble
for the rebound the buzzer sounded,
ending the game.

“We were trying to get the ball to
Collins but she was covered,” said
Tirik. “Fubio looked open sol threw
it in to her, but with four seconds
you can’t do too much but throw it
up and hope it goes in.”

The Lady Panthers are now 9-6 in
the Big East and must beat Connect-
icut on Saturday to finish fourth. St.
John’s is now 12-4 in the Big East
and could finish in a tie for ﬁrst if
Villanova loses at Providence on
Saturday. _

Bruce led Pitt with 23 points and
14 rebounds, with help from Gilhoo-
ley who had 14 points and seven
rebounds and Kim Gannis with 10
points. St. John’s was led by Yard
who had 16, Smith's 15 and Jan Bur-
gess with 13.

Swimmers finish perfect

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

When a sports team performs
poorly, more often than not it is the
coach who takes the blame. And so
when .a team performs well, the
coach should get a good part of the
credit.

University of Pittsburgh women’s
swim coach David Belowich cer-
tainly deserves credit. His athletes
went 9-0 this season, the ﬁrst time
the team has gone undefeated since
1976. It was only the second time
that a team Belowich has coached
has accomplished such an honor. (In
his third season at Sarasota (Fla.)

High School, his boys’ team went
11-0.)

They accomplished this by defeat-
ing Princeton 84-56 in the season
finale at Trees Pool.

“It’s nice from a personal stand-
point,” Belowich said. “I am goal-
oriented and so is the program. It is
the satisfaction of accomplishing a
goal.”

Belowich, who is from Butler, Pa.,
has been at Pitt since the 1981-82
season. The past two seasons he has
coached the Lady Panthers to two
consecutive Big East titles, and a
third one could be close at hand.

The Big East Swimming and Div-
ing Championships will be held at
Pitt’s Trees Pool on Feb. 28-March
2. Pitt is once again expected to win
it all.

New lineup to start against BC

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Surveying the smoldering heap
before him, Roy Chipman acted not
with calculation but instinct. Onlv
when his eighth year as head basket-
ball coach expires next month will
he deem his actions responsible or
careless.

Until that evaluation is filed, he’s
content that he thoughtfully disre-
garded the open-window option.

After St. .lohn’s and Georgetown,
first and second in the ‘nation,
respectively, sheared the Panthers
by a collective 45 points, his squad
lay in ruins.

The fire under control, it isn’t
necessarily doused. So, yesterday
Chipman first cordoned off this
week’s practices fromall inquirers
(no media bias). Next, he announced
that the starting lineup will change
for tomorrow’s 8 p.m. game against
Boston College.

Significantly.

“I don’t know how long or how
drastic it will be," Chipman said.
“It's a safe bet there will be changes.

“We have some people in the
lineup who are not contributing.
The point we’re trying to get across
is any game you go into, you play as
hard as you can. We haven’t done
that.” '

It is Chipman’s first lineup shuffle
in nine games. Another cautionary
wager says it’s his first this late in the
season at Pitt. Only center Keith
Armstrong and forward Charles
Smith are likely holdovers. Any
other betting money will not be on

the Panthers (I5-9, 6-7), who face a
B.C. team which has scored seven
victories in its last nine tries.

The Eagles are 18-7, 7-7, and are
in fifth place, one-half game ahead
of the Panthers.

To better two straight 6-l0 sea-
sons, the Panthers must also face
Syracuse on the road and Villanova
at home before the curtain falls on
the season. Their sixth-place niche
isn’t so secure, as Connecticut is one
breath away.

“We really want them to focus in
on that," Chipman said, trying to
emphasize just that. “I know we
played the top teams in the country,
but we go into games with goals in
mind. Not goals to win those games,
but you must play well and execute
the game plan.”

That is nearly impossible when
your point guard shoots two-of-22
in the last three games -— after scor-
ing 43 points in the two previous
games. ‘

Buffalo sophomore Curtis Aiken
has rudely realized his shooting
resembles the hometown weather.
Because of these most recent frontal
patterns, senior reserve Charles
Thompson will likely replace the guy
who’s been Pitt‘s court generalall
season.

No matter to Chipman. He’s done
playing meteorologist. .

“We’ve tried doing everything we
can,” Chipman said. “We’ve tried to
explain he’s a good player. There’s
only so many directions a coach‘ can
go. —

“What we really want him to do is
understand his not shooting well
doesn’t necessarily mean he can’t do
other things. There seems to be a
large correlation between shooting

well and helping the team. I see it as

a point guard: Distribute the ball,
handle the ball, execute. And, hope-
fully shoot the ball.

“I‘m still confident Curtis Aiken
can be a good point guard. But he
has to be confident he can be a good
point guard.”

Interestingly, Aiken is the second
leading scorer with 10.6 ppg. He
could see his first benching this year
as two other up-and-comers can
anticipate their first starts. Fresh-

man Junie Lewis, leadingthe Panth- \

ers with 12 points against
Georgetown, could be alongside
Thompson at second guard. Or it
could possibly bejunior Joey David.

The dozen points came after
Lewis hadn’t even played against St.
John’s or UConn and scored zeros in
the two games prior to that.

Replacing power forward Chip
Watkins makes for a tossup between
Darryl Shepherd and Marlon Fer-
guson. Recall that Shepherd entered
the B.C. game Jan. 21 in the second
half. scoring eight crucial points
before fouling out. Currently, Shep-
herd_i_s hitting 49 percent from the
field in l2.5 minutes a game. Fergu-
son is four percentage points higher,
but has only half ofthe playingtime.

“Go down from any position and
everyone has to contribute,” Chip-
man said ofthe noted absences in the
last two games. -

“I try not to focus on the two
losses. I try to focus on why the two
losses occurred.”

Boston College's Gary Williams
doing the slow roll to the NCAA
Tournament, page 18.

“I feel like I let a lot of people down.”

championship in a fight with Larry Holmes, June

Wrestlers in final tune-up meet

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

The Pitt wrestlers are traveling to
the eastern part of the state where
they will wrestle their last dual meets
ofthe season. On Saturday at 2 p.m.,
the Panthers will meet Franklin and
Marshall College. Later that even-
ing, they head for Millersville State,
where they will compete at 7 p.m.

“Even though we’ll be competing
against two teams on Saturday,
there is a five-hour break in between
and that should give us ample time
to recuperate,” explained head
coach Rande Stottlemyer.

The Panthers are going into the
matches with hopes of reaching a
goal they had set for themselves ear-

lier this year.

“When we reviewed our schedule
and personnel in the beginning of
the season, we had projected on
paper to ﬁnish 5-10,” said assistant
coach Jack Spates. “From there, we
set our goals on a 9-6 ﬁnish. Where
things stand, going into the matches
this weekend, it looks like we’ll at
least be able to ﬁnish 8-7." __

‘*1 think it’s important to note that
even if we ﬁnish 8-7, it’s still ‘a win-
ning record," added Stottlemyer.
“That was also a goal we had hoped
to achieve.

“We're looking forward to this
weekend, because it’ll be a good way
to finish out the season in dual
meets. Plus it’ll be the guys’ last
chance to prepare for the Eastern
Wrestling League, Championships
against opponents other than their
own teammates," Stottlemyer

continued.

The Panthers’ problem of ﬁelding
a full team continues, yet they are
hopeful that Ken Hackman (injury)
and Curt Conner (illness) will return
before tomorrow’s matches.

‘‘It’s almost devastating to give up
as much as we do because of our lack
of depth," said Spates. “Yet, despite
the fact that we often came up short,
it has been really encouraging to see
the outstanding progress certain
individuals have made. And“ most
importantly, the team’s unity and
spirit are better than ever.”

After they return from the week-
end’s trip, the wrestlers will begin
their ﬁnal preparations for the
E.W.L. Championships which will
be held next Saturday at Lock
Haven University. Anyone inter-
ested in tickets should contact
Coach Stottlemyer at 624-4605.

Women hope to get back on track

‘$1.00 on-‘ COUPON 0N

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s basketball team
will need to regroup after the tough
loss to St. John’s, ifthey are going to
keep their hopes alive for a good
tournament seed. The last obstacle
in the regular season for the Lady
Panthers is in the form of the Uni-
versity of Connecticut.

Pitt travels to Storrs this Saturday
afternoon in an attempt to get a lock
on third place in the Big East, but
this team will need a good bit of help
from the bottom three teams in the
conference.

Pitt has to defeat Connecticut,
and last-place Seton Hall must upset

Boston College, currently a game
ahead of Pitt and in third place.
Seton Hall is 12-13 after Wednes-
day’s loss to frontrunner Villanova,
71-55. A Pitt victory and a Boston
College loss would leave both teams
with identical 10-6 conference
records, but Pitt would be awarded
third place by way of their two victo-
ries over the Eagles in conference
play.

Syracuse is also in the picture, tied
with Pitt in fourth place at 9-6. The
Orangewomen face 3-12 George-
town on Saturday, and unless Pat
Ewing puts a wig on, it looks like a
sure thing for Syracuse.

Should things not work out in
Pitt’s favor, the Lady Panthers
would most likely end up in fifth
place, a spot that would pair them
against host Syracuse in the first

round of the Big East tournament,
which is being held next weekend.
For now, the task at hand is
UConn. Pitt already has a 30-point
victory over the Huskies this season,

but the 3-12 Huskies will not roll '

over and play dead.

The Huskies are led by their
“Twin Towers," as they are called in
Storrs. They are forwards Leigh
Curl and Peggy Walsh. Both possess
almost identical statistics, Curl with
14.7 ppg and 7.7 rpg and Walsh with
l4.6 ppg and 7.8 rpg.

Complementing the Twin Towers
are guards Jill Brumbaugh and
Tammi Sweet and center Jennifer
Weideman.

Coach Jean Balthaser’s squad
went down to Providence 64-49
Wednesday night, as their overall
record dropped to 9-16.

The Pitt News, Friday, February 22, 1985

Panthers in stretch run,
Boston College tomorrow  

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Gary Williams can't complain —
not even about Rick Pitino.

Williams, the third-year basket-
ball coach of Boston College, may

only have a 7-7 (18-7 overall) mark
in the Big East, but nothing has yet
managed to dent his relaxing,
though persuasive mannerisms.

Not even the rumors that one New
York Knicks assistant coach spreads
of Williams transferringjobs. Emit-
ting a ragged benevolence from his
office yesterday, Williams repeated
once again the Pitino soothsayings.

“I think Rick wants this job at
B.C.,” Williams cracked softly. “I've
already heard this from three differ-
ent people.”

Granted, Williams doesn’t grow
tired of hearing the reruns. But ever
since last week, when Auburn coach
Sonny Smith announced his retire-
ment come season’s end, Williams
has been linked to his replacement.

“It's a pretty goodjob here, people
forget that,” Williams said. “We’ve
had success here. Why put myself in
a situation where success wouldn’t
be so available?”

Had Williams repeated that Jan.
21, rhetoricians would have ques-
tioned his style. That night the Pan-
thers overcame a 14-point deficit at
Roberts Center to pull out a 61-55
win. It dropped the reeling Eagles to
2-5 in the Big East.

Now, Williams only reels when he
roams the sidelines. Ever since that
defeat, B.C. has won seven of nine
games, including big one-point vic-
tories over Villanova (62-61) and
Syracuse (67-66) recently.

Tomorrow, B.C. will try avenging
that loss when facing the Panthers at

8 p.m. at Fitzgerald Field House.
“We've played hard since that
[Pitt] game," Williams said. “We’ve
had some good wins in the league.”
The biggest would have been
Wednesday night at Alumni Hall,
where B.C. notched a four-point
halftime lead before falling to No. 1
St. John's 71-69, and the biggest
since B.C. took Georgetown to over-
time Jan.» 5 before losing 82-80.
Seemingly, Williams took the
latest loss instride. After all, center
Trevor Gordon missed a dunk in the
closing seconds, during which time
guard Stu Primus also missed a

layup.

“We just wanted the win each
time,” Williams said. “It bothers you
a little bit. And I am a little frus-
trated. You work hard in the games,
but it is nice to feel you played the
No. 1 team to a two-point game.”

Except for senior Michael
Adams, Williams has a no-name
bunch carving its own image. The
point guard leads the Eagles with 16
ppg and 5.5 assists.

Junior Dom Pressley is tops in
field goals (55 percent), while Gor-
don snares 5.5 rebounds per contest.
The same JUCO transfer Gordon
who was one term paper shy of
season-long ineligibility the day Pitt
beat B.C. 7‘

“We’re competitive, even though
no one here is great,” ' Williams
admitted. “We don’t have great
shooters, only players who work
hard.”

A schedule working in B.C.’s
favor forces Williams to also admit
this year surpasses the 18-12 cam-
paign last year.

Outside of big conference wins.
the Eagles have beaten Wake Forest
(82-76), Michigan State (82-78) and
sleeper Texas Christian (92-75). Add
it all up and B.C. plays six Top 20
teams — four of them twice —

-

before the 1984-85 season ends.

“People who know their basket-
ball read into your schedule,” Wil-
liams said. “We didn't play in Alaska
or Hawaii and pick up a couple of
wins there like other teams do. I like
to think we’ve had a great year con-
sidering the lack of attention in the
preseason.”

The story doesn't end there.

“We’re good enough to be in thC_'~.

NCAAs,” Williams said of the 64-
team field. “We've beaten enough
teams to prove that.”

The story adds onto itself against
the Panthers now cursing a two-
game losing skid.

“They’re still in a good position to
know how well they can finish,” Wil-

continued on page twenty

hams said graciously. “But I hate to
play a team after a situation Pitt's
just been through. Where they didn’t
shoot well, probably didn't handle
the ball well. Pittsburgh happened
to run into a buzzsaw. Now Chip-
man has the players’ attention.-They
know what they're up against."

Williams smoothly shifts gears,
telling of how Virginia Common-
wealth coach J.D. Barnett will
surely receive Sonny Smith's old
whistle. Of why he, Gary Williams,
wouldn’t fit in too well withthe Con-
federate Red: “Wait until the season
is over and he‘ll be there,” Williams
wanted to assure. “Me, I don’t know
those people. They probably
wouldn't understand my language.
Auburn, Alabama, where is it? The
whole league is new to me.

“I wouldn't even know how to
recruit Mississippi.”

Clemente legacy

PITTSBURGH (UPI) -
The Pittsburgh Pirates have
signed the late Roberto Cle-
mente’s son, Luis Roberto Cle-
mente, to a contract with their
rookie-league affiliate in Braden-
ton, Fla.

The I8-year-old Clemente
became the second son of the
Pirate Hall-of-Fame member to
sign a professional baseball con-
tract. The eldest son, Roberto '
Jr., was signed last year by Phila-
delphia and played with the Phil-
lie’s affiliate in the Gulf Coast
Rookie League.

“We're confident that we will
win,” Belowich said. “We are not
cocky, but I think that we should be
first, or at worst second, in most of
the events. We are ready to swim

fast. My personal goal is that every-

body goes in there and does well.”
Tickets for the Big East Cham-

pionships are available by calling the
