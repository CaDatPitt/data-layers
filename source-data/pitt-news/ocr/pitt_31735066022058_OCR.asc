THE PITTNEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

 

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Boy, did you miss it. Students
who went home because they
couldn’t give up their summer
jobs at K Mart missed seeing Pitt
in the headlines —— “under fire”
for former President Wesley
Posvar’s $3.3 million retirement
settlement, among other things.

The following is a compilation of .

events reported in the weekly Pitt

' News:

May 8, 1991:

oPitt withdrew its participation
from an alumni dinner at an Erie
club which allegedly refused to
admit women.

-Pitt’s former food—service
manager said he paid prostitutes
with Pitt funds to entertain
university officials and alumni on

.business trips, among other

improprieties.

-City Council passed a bill,
sponsored by council member
Michelle Madoff, which would
limit noise, especially loudradios.
-Public safety director William

‘ Brennan alleged in a confidential

memo obtained by the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette that campus police
ofﬁcers arrested students illegally
by gaining search warrants on the
advice of a fictitious confidential
informant, and public safety
inflated crime statistics to make it
seem that officers were doing
more work.

Assistant Director of Public
Safety Walt Waters denied the
allegations.

May 15, 1991:

-Federal auditors reported that
Pitt wrongly charged $259,089 in
dubious administrative expenses,
such as travel costs for Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s wife
and symphony tickets, as
overhead expenses for federal
research grants. University
spokespeople and administrators
said the audit represented a
misunderstanding between »' the
Department ofHealth and Human
Services, which performed the
audit, and the university about
the billing of administrative costs.
-Two suspended university food-
service managers left Pitt. An audit
in December revealed Pitt’s food-
service contractor catered a
private wedding reception for a
friend of Robert Heddleston,
former executive director of the
Golden Panthers.

-Dennis Brutus, former
chairperson of Pitt’s black studies
department, political activist and
prizewinning poet, was granted
permission to return to South
Africa after 25 years in exile.
-William Savage of the University
of Illinois-Champaign was named
director of affirmative action at
Pitt.

May 22, 1991:

oPitt’s University Senate
suggested that Pitt’s ROTC
program be ended by 1997 if the
De partment of Defense continues
to discriminate against gays and
lesbians.

0 Pitt officials disclosed last week
Posvar’s salary had been raised

$55,000 to $242,000 in the 1989
90 fiscal year.

-About 6,000 pro—life protesters 
formed a human chain through _

Pittsburgh.
May 29. 1991
0 Posvar’s $3.3 million retirement

package was a “shockingly 

generous severance settlement,”
according to the University Senate

‘budget—po1icies committee
chairperson. Posvar will continue if -

to receive $201,000 of his present
$242,000 salary for life, along
with $3.5 million in university
retirement funds and an
agreement by Pitt to suspend
repayment of $700,000 in low-
interest mortgages until Posvar’s
death. "

-Pitt paid over a half-rnillion
dollars for groceries and supplies
for Posvar’s home over the last
24 years, according to reports in
the Post—Gazette.

-A new dorm, “which will be
better than any existing dorm on
campus,” will be ready for
occupancy by fall 1992, according

to Pitt’s assistant vice president.

of student affairs.

June 5, 1991:

-The chairperson of the House
Appropriations Committee
recommended that Pitt not
receivean increase in its state
subsidy because Pitt officials
“lied” when the committee
investigated
multimillion-dollar retirement
settlement. ,

0 Posvar transferred his dutiesto

In" February the Black Action
Society announced that it could
no longer recommend the
University of Pittsburgh to
prospective black students
because of deficiencies in the
social, academic, political and
cultural atmosphere.

The following week, the BAS
issued a statement of 14 demands.

“We’ve made some progress
on some points, but there's still
far to go until most of the issues
are resolved,” said BAS Executive
Assistant Marcus Guy.

The BAS is compiling an
updated report on the progress
made in negotiating the 14 points.
The report will be distributed to
students at the Indaba in early
September. , '

“If you don’t inform the students

 of what you’re doing, you can’t

university state its plans for the
recruitment and retention of black
faculty.

Jack Daniel, associate provost,
sent a memo to the chairs of
every department of Pitt’s main

 progresses in ﬁght to achieve 14 points

and branch campuses, requesting
their input on how to recruit and
retain black faculty, Guy said.
The BAS will meet with Daniel to
discuss the results of his efforts in
the fall.

Members of the BAS have
spoken to Vice President of
Student Affairs William Harmon
about the acquisition of a van to
transport black students to and
from off—campus social events on
weekends.

Wiley said he is hopeful that
this and the other points will be

' granted.

“We hope to get a working
coalition to get these 14 points
resolved,” he said.

The BAS has not spoken with
Pitt President]. Dennis O’Connor,
but Guy and Wiley are hopeful
that O’Connor will be more
receptive than former President
Wesley Posvar.

Guy said he has heard about
O’Connor’s receptiveness to
student concerns and hopes the
new president will be willing to
work with the BAS to enact the
14-point plan.

“We’re pretty hopeful that he’ll L

come around,” Wiley said. “If this
university is really serious about
making this campus diverse, then
I think [the 14 points are] one step
toward making that happen."
Both Guy and Wiley encourage
active student participation in the
black struggle at the University of
Pittsburgh. ' _
“Get active in BAS speciﬁcally

.and in the university as a whole,”

Wiley said. '

“Maybe ‘things like Posvar
getting that, kind of [retirement
fund] and the other things that go
"on that we don’t know about yet
l...] wouldn't go on if we asked
questions and got active on this
campus.”

“If the students feel they’re

' being treated unfairly, fight back.

Join the struggle,” he said.

Libraries 

lac/e funds,

’ By Laura Gallagher

Stajf Writer

University of Pittsburgh
students should not expect
to see any new books on
the library shelves this year.

Pitt increased the libraries’
1991 acquisition or “book”
budget by 15 percent, but
that amount takes into
account the “incredible rate
of inflation” for books, said
Paul Kobulnicky, director
of Pitt’s University Library
Systems.

Kobulnicky said that
students should not expect
“any more or any fewer
books on the shelves.”

While the acquisition

budget remains stable,‘_
Kobulnicky admitted to a"

4.2—percent reduction in the
non—acquisition budget that
has cut library staff by 16
positions. .

“We have lost some
librarians by attrition
lretirement, resignation,
etc.l, but there have been
no ﬁrings,” Kobulnicky said.

“The libraries’ budget was
not cut by any more than
any other department. In
an effort to balance the-

‘ university budget, budget

centers in every Pitt

department were cut,” said;
D onald-f

Pitt Provost
Henderson.

A 12-percent increase I in_ 
minimum wage has also”
affected Pitt libraries. “There .

are fewer hours for student
workers. Students may not
see books lreshelved] quite
as quickly,” Kobulnicky
said.’

‘Other Oakland libraries
are also struggling to
continue services amidst
budget cuts.

The Carnegie Libraries of
Pittsburgh, including the
Oakland branch, are
underfunded by $3 million
a year, according to Bob
Croneberger, the libraries’
director.

“The book budget is a
million dollars below what
it should be. ,We are
spending $1.5 million on
books when we should be
spending $2.5 million,”
Croneberger said, citing a
recent report on the
Carnegie libraries issued by
Jack Robin, president of
Urban Redevelopment.

Staff salaries are also far
below the national average,
according to Croneberger.
The average salary for a
staff librarian at the Carnegie
is $21,655.

A 1991 study of 37 large
U.S. public libraries showed
the average minimum salary
was $24,142, and the
average maximum salary

was $32,589. Carnegie’s
average minimum and-

Directions to Milt Wolfson’s
house aren’t necessary. It’s the

one with the garden— an unruly ‘

tangle of hydrangea, lilies and

over 100 other kinds of ﬂowers

growing wherever they want.
“A lot of people find it

disturbing. It’s not orderly; things

aren’t in rows. I like it that Way,”
he said. ‘
Wolfson, who takes classes

through the Over-60 Program at

Pitt, is as individualistic as his
subversive garden. At age 73,
he’s testified at the McCarthy
hearings, worked as a ﬁngerprint
classifier for the FBI and served
in World War II in military
intelligence.

He’s volunteered as a pro-
choice escort, protested the war
in Vietnam and belongs to a “pro-
ferninist, pro-gay rights" men's
group.

“I’ve been an activist as long as
I can remember,” he said.

Wolfson was working for the
Bureau of Mines when he was
accused of being a Communist

lsympathizer and called to testify

in the McCarthy hearings.

“I had signed a petition to have
the Communists on the ballot 
I thought that was the American
way.” '

He was also suspect because
when he lived_in Washington,
one of his roommates was a
Communist: “Actually, he was
the nicest guy in the place.”

Wolfson had raised money for
an organization that fought
fascism in Italy and Spain. “The
charge was, and this was official,

I was a ‘premature anti-Fascist.’ It
sounds like Orwell pretty much
— 1984.”

There wasn’t a defense lawyer
present at the hearing. Someone
“who made his livingtalking to
people and reporting adverse
things” reported that Wolfson had
said, “if we got into a war with
Russia, I would not ﬁght. I got
very angry about this, and I said,
‘You can see I’m reasonably
intelligent. If I did believe that,
which I don’t, why would I say
that to someone I met two minutes
ago?’

“I think the fact that I got all
excited and I made a good point
was the basis that I was
exonerated.”

He wasn’t blacklisted and was
allowed to keep his job. .“But
that’s when I decided_that I didn’t
want I to work with the
government.” He retired in 1980
after working for U.S. Steel for 18
years. -

When he attended the City
College of New York, Wolfson
led a boycott of classes ..“that
sounded much like the ’60s except
about 20 years earlier.” The
college president had invited a
group of Italian ofﬁcials from
Benito Mussolini’s government
to address the students at an_
assembly.

“We didn’t like that. When [the
president] started to introduce
the speakers, the head of our
committee tried to grab the
microphone  So there was a big
furor, and we were all clapping.
So the president called us
‘guttersnipes.’ City College was a
pretty intelligentbunch of people.

Oakland restaurants face health violations

By David T. Welch
Sta_[)“Writer

Restaurant-goers in Oakland
should know more about the
food than what is written on the

_ menu. Some Of the restaurants in

Oakland ‘have been cited for
health violations.

The Szechuan Express on
Oakland Avenue was the most
frequently cited establishment in
Oakland, with pastviolations that
include roach infestations and an
unsanitary kitchen area.

The restaurant has earned “C”
ratings from the Allegheny County
Health Department on six
different occasions and was even
closed once during the last year
and a half.

The Pitt News investigated
Health Department records from
the past two years for about 15
Oakland restaurants. .

If a restaurant has a “C” rating,
“you should seriously consider
whether or not you want to go in
t-here. They have serious
violations that could cause food-
borne illness," Chief of Food
Inspection Glenda Christy said.

Most of the violations which
caused the “C” rating were
corrected by the time the
Szechuan was inspected on July
31, 1991, when it was given an
“A” rating. But that rating is
pending an upcoming

reinspection of the restaraunt.
, “There has been improvement,
but we will not let them Off the

hook. There is the likelihood that
if they do not correct critical
violations, we would move
forward for action. There has
been a lot of action at that facility,
and we will be watching them
closely,” said Larry Stell of the
Health Department.

Stefl said current violations
include insufficient handwashin g
by the kitchen personnel and
inadequate , cooking
temperatures.

The restaurant has had an “A”
rating since April 16, when it
corrected a’ series of violations
which caused a “C” to be posted
on April 8. I

The “C” rating followed a failure
to correct violations found in a
Feb. 14 inspection. Among them
were re-use of plastic gloves,
failure Of the employees to wash
their hands even after taking out
garbage, unsafe food
temperatures and a water system
which allowed dirty water to come
back through the system.

Conditions were acceptable
until February, following a
reinstatement of the Szechuan’s
permit on Nov. 13, 1990. The
facility was closedon Oct. 29,
1990, when an inspection
revealed gross health violations.

The kitchen played host to as
many as 30 live roaches. Garbage
was being stored in containers
on the roof; kitchen utensils were

not cleaned; food was being
cooked and stored at
unacceptable temperatures;

Negative answers to the following questions

warrant a “C” rating:
0Does the food come from a safe source?
-Do they have facilities that can maintain product

temperature?

-Are personnel free from infectious or conlmunicable

diseases?

-Are the personnel practicing good hygiene (washing
their hands, using hair nets, etc.)?

-Is the water source safe?

-Are sewage and waste disposed of properly?
-Are the cooking utensils cleaned and sanitized at proper

temperatures?

-Is there proper pest control?
SOu.rce.- Glenda C’/misty, chief of food z'nspcclz'on, Allegheny

County Health Departmen

employees had not been washing
their hands, _and they were
cleaning with dirty rags. Before
that Szechuan Express had a “C”
rating since April 12, 1990.

Larry Stefl of the Health
Department said a language
barrier caused the problem. The
employees did not understand
what needed to be corrected, he
said.

“The problem is the old
ownership. They did not speak
English, The new partner speaks
fluent English, and we have
provided them with foOd—service
manuals in Chinese and English,”
Steﬂ said.

Albert Liang became a co-
Owner of the restaurant in March,
and since then conditions have
improved. Liang blamed the
conditionson a lack of utensils.

“The inspectors are very strict.

‘They want us to wash and clean

every utensil after we use them.
We did not have time to Clean
them. We were too busy to wash
and let them air dry. But
everything is changed now. We
bought more bowls” to cook with
some while others are being
cleaned, Liang said.

Other Oakland restaurants,
including C.J. Barney’s, The
Original Hot Dog Shop, Primanti
BrOs., Uncle Sam’s Subs,_the Hong
Kong Express, Peter's Pub, Pizza
Hut, Burger King and McDonald’s
all have _long histories of “A”
ratings.

Although rat droppings and a
dead roach were discovered at
Pizza Hut in January, no pests
were found and the restaurant
was able to keep its “A” rating.

Two live roaches in the kitchen at
Primanti’s did not cause any action
by the Health Department.

The Hong Kong Express was
cited for low cooking

temperatures and for Storing raw ,

chicken Over vegetables on June
13. But an unannounced
inspection four days later revealed
that both infractions were
corrected.

Since most of the violations
that the Allegheny Health
Department finds are minor, it
concentrates on critical violations.
The restaurant will be warned
and given about a week to
eliminate the problem before an
unannounced surprise inspection.

“In many cases we go back,
and the guy didn’t do anything.
When we go back again, we take
some kind of disciplinary action.

_We give them a ‘C’ rating, take

their permit or press criminal
charges," Christy said. “Of cou rse,
if we go in and find rats and

roaches all over the place, we '

will close the place down.”

A restaurant with a “C" rating
will have a red sticker in the front
doorway with a large “C” on it.

Other ratings include “A” and
“B.” An “A" means the restaurant
has met all criteria and can be
identified by a gold sticker.

A “B” rating has a green sticker,
and it indicates that the
establishment has no critical
violations. But “it may have dirty
floors, walls or ceilings,” Christy

said.

Stajf Writer

What do a 70-year-old woman
looking for fun and a married
man who enjoys being penetrated

by his dildo-clad wife have in,

common? They’re part of the 976
phone—number subculture
advertised in The Pitt News
classifieds.

Nationally, America's interest
in 9776/900 numbers is increasing.
Dating, phone sex and

I conversation lines are now part

of a billion-dollar-a—year industry,’

according to Business Week.
These services include

Pittsburghers’ shocking true

‘confessions, men looking for

women or men, women seeking
men, a swingers’ line, an all-male
porn stars fantasy line and a local
women—in-ecstasy phone line.
There’s apparently a market for

everything and everyone. Many

   
   

services are_prerecordings. After
listening to 10 or so shocking
confessions, callers can leave their
own secret confessions.

This works the same for talking
personals. After hearing 10 to 15
Pittsburgh-area personals, a non-
toll number is given for you to
leave your own message.

Callers leave their phone
numbers, addresses or post-office
boxes to make contact with the
interested.

And, of course, 976/900
numbers are billed directly to
your phone.

— However, there are differences
in the basic 99—cent-per-minute

. rate.

Men who wish to contact
women (and vice versa) pay more.
Men seeking other men pay four
cents less, while swingers pay 11
cents less.

At the beginning of .all calls, a
prerecorded message asks those

under 18 years of age to hang up
immediately.

After the initial message explains
the costs, the fun begins.

True Confessions Pittsburgh is
advertised on television as well.
Various callers phone in to leave
their “shocking, true” confessions
for the entire city to hear..

A prerecorded message

announces that messages are

changed three times a day, and

only 15 are played at a time.
Veronica always cheats on her

boyfriend. With his friends, with

strangers — you name it; she's a .

girl around town.

Chris, a white male, wants to
have an affair with a black woman.

Mike wants to be dominated by
a female. “Hurt me!” he screams.

Ted has shaving fantasies. He
wants to “make it with a woman
[while he's] dressed asa woman,
all smooth and silky.”

(These were some of the best
confessions.)

“Hear all—male XXX video star

‘I Jeff Stryker, $2,” the advertisement

reads. Jeff Stryker starred in gay
male erotica in the late ’80s. ‘He
also crossed over into bisexual
and straight erotica. '

According to Interview
magazine,'he has become one of
the most popular adult-movie
actors.

Stryker’s popularity goes to the
extreme; adult magazines even
offer a dildo made from a cast of
his erect penis.

On his phone line, an
indiscernible noise, which I
assume is a motorcycle engine
and bad electronic music,
screeches in the background. The

quality of the recording tape is
poor. Jeff describes himself as a
26-year-old who likes motorcycles
and fast cars. 2

A caller can select four different
fantasies, and Jeff reminds the
caller that fantasies are changed
daily. '

Fantasy No. 1 recounts a day at
the gym with the “heavenly muscle
men." After a hard workout, he
heads off to theJacuzzi. “Enjoying
the Jacuzzi to the max," a “real
good—looking blond stud” joins
him.

Stryker and the stud take part in
a “mutual tug job” (mutual
masturbation). After a few minutes
of simultaneous moans and macho

_ dialogue, Stryker and the stud “let

it all rip.” ’

The women's fantasy line
offered the story ofJill, who enjoys
the outdoors and guys. “Tell me
exactly what you want to do to
me,” she asks.

Describing a lawn as “nice and
green,” the sun heats her naked
body. She squeals, “It’s just so
good, baby,”

What follows are some of the
weirdest noises I have ever heard,
reminiscent of Donna Summer’s
orgasm in “Love to Love You
Baby” — but this time sung by
Snow White. (Once again, the
tape quality is poor.)

The men’s fantasy line
disconnected me before I could
hear straight men in ecstasy.

The talking personals for men
seeking women are set up like the
confessions. ./

You can leave your own
message by waiting for the number
at the end of the call.

Phone sex offers companionship — for a price

The women range in age from
25 to 70. Beth, a 52-year-old
divorced Catholic, seeks a man
49 to 58 with “values.” _

Joanne is into Harleys and

Professors publish short

Byjim Wechsler
Copy Editor

There’s more to being a
professor than teaching classes.
Professors spend much of their
time working on outside projects,
and getting the results published
makes them familiar to the public.
Here’s a look at what some of
Pitt’s professors have had
published over the summer.

Lewis “Buddy” Nordan,
associate professor of English,
has just completed his third book
of short fiction, Music of the
Swamp.

Set in Mississippi, Swamp spins

‘ 10 intertwining yarns about the

is

It’ I

 

life of Sugar Macklin, a boy with
an inexplicable love for his
hopeless father. Nordan said
Macklin had been a recurring
character in two previous
collections, but Swamp marks his
debut ‘as a lead character.

“This book is about ﬁnding
love in strange and even
sometimes grotesque
circumstances,” said Nordan, who

has taught at Pitt for eight years. '

During Swamp, Macklin grows
from age 10 to age 1 3, but Nordan
said the tales are not in
chronological order.

Nordan hails from Mississippi,

.but he said_he has not lived there

in 30 years. His latest project, a '

full-length novel which is not
related to any of his previous
works, is set in Pittsburgh.

Swamp is published by
Algonquin Books and is currently
available in bookstores.

Jeremy Sabloff pursued a career
in anthropology because “it
sounded fascinating.” Now a
professor and chairperson of Pitt’s

department of anthropology,
Sabloff is publishing the results
of his research.

From 1983 to 1988, Sabloff was
co-director of an expedition to
Sayil, a Maya Indian site on the
Yucatan peninsula. (The Yucatan
peninsula separates the Gulf of
Mexico from the Caribbean Sea.)
This “month, Sabloff and co-
director Gair Tourtellot are
publishing the first in a series of
final reports on the trip.

Last spring, The Scientific
American Library published
Sabloffs The New Archaeology
and the Ancient Maya.

“The book is an intellectual

study of the Maya,” Sabloff said.
In the past, archaeologists took
an interest in elitist Mayan culture,
studying the pyramids and other
structures, according to Sabloff.
He said recent digs have been
more concerned with the
complete Mayan culture. As a
result, “we have a completely
new understanding of the Mayan
civilization,” Sabloff said.
‘ Sabloff and Tou1tel1ot’s reports
are being published by the Middle
American Research Institute at
Tulane University (La.).

Ted Windt, a 22-year veteran

associate professor of
communication at Pitt, has had
three books published within the
past year.

Last September, the University
of Alabama Press published
Windt’s Presidents and Pnotwtors:
Political Rhetoric in the 19605.
The book is chronologically the
third in a planned six-volume
series exploring the history of
presidential rhetoric.

In November 1990, Rhetoric as
aHumanAdventure.- A Biography
of Everett Lee Hunt hit the
bookstands. Hunt is not part of
the series.

stories, political commentary

These two works earned Windt
the Eastern Communication
Association's Award for
Scholarship, presented in April
1991. Although reviewed
independently, each of the books
was a finalist in the voting.

“I was competing against

myself, so they gave it to me for ,

those two books,” Windt said.
The Cold War as Rhetoric: Yhe

Pitt janitors: the men and women behind the scenes

THE
GIFT
THAT’S
PLEASURE
FOR

By Douglas Herman
For The Pitt News

Philmore Austin’s been at Pitt
for 40 years because “the post
office never called.”

Austin, a custodian in the space-
research center, said the number
of custodians working at the
university has rapidly decreased.
David Jaros, a custodian at the
law school, attributes this to a
university “hiring freeze.”

But Chris Weinstein, a facilities
manager, said a redistribution
plan has been instated, not a

_ hiring freeze. “We take people

from one place and put them
where we need them. It makes
them work a little harder.”

Barbara Welch, a custodian for
four years at Forbes Quadrangle,
said, “The pressure is the most
difficult part of this job! We don’t
have enough people. They're not
hiring — it’s not fair! It’s more
work on us. Thank God for the
[student custodiansl.”

The 191 full-time custodians
and the 40 part—time students are

  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 

responsible for the maintenance
of over 40 buildings on campus.

Benny White, who currently
oversees the operations of about
one-fourth of the campus
custodians, said the custodians
deserve more recognition.

He has held the positions of
custodian, mechanic and
supervisor and currently is
assistant facilities manager.

“Just because you are a
custodian dosen’t mean you
cannot advance yourself,” White
said.

White said he has come a long
way since his distinction of being
the first person to swim in the

' pool at Trees Hall.

Other members of the custodial
staff have similar memories.

Leon Blakston, a custodian in
the law school, said he remembers
a murder in the parking garage of
the Towers. Austin told of a
chemistry student who was
caught stealing a test from the
main office of Alumni Hall.

“On my first day, June 29, 1988,
there was a ﬂood in Scaife Hall. I

can remember standing there with
a wet-vac asking if this sort of
thing happens often!” Jaros said.

Jaros said that custodians are
still looked down upon because
“our work is done with a mop,
not a pen!”

“There have, for instance, been
a lot of burglaries and professors
point the finger at us,” Welch
said. ‘‘That’s ridiculous! We don’t
get here until 5:30 [a.m.], and we
leave at 2:30 [p.m.]

“The professors are either
supposed to take the equipment
or lock the door, but they don’t!
And when something is missing,
they point the finger at us. We
have no standing to them,” she
said.

Weinstein said he is not aware
of many burglaries, and when
they do occur, most faculty only
ask the custodians if they’ve seen
anyone suspicious.

“They don’t really question [the
custodians’]
Weinstein said. V

a rhetorical point of view, how

thus the Cold War — developed.

“I think [Beginnings is] coming
out at a really good time because
it parallels what's going on right

Do you have a burning question
and can’t seem to find an answer
anywhere? Who ya gonna call?
624-FACT —Telefact, of course.

Do you need help getting
directions around the city or
Oakland? Or maybe you'd like to
know the best place to park
around here (if there really is one).
Maybe you need to know which
bus to take. T elefact can help.

Telefact is an information
service provided to students,

'9' faculty and anyone else who calls.
“We don’t turn away anyone,”'

said0Pam Gennaula, student
coordinator for Telefact.

Gennaula said Telefact is
“designed to help people get
around the university and to cut
through the red tape. There were
a couple of different little places
to go, but there was no one central
place to go for information.”

Since Telefact opened its phone
lines last year, it has answered
over 38,000 phone calls, with
about 80 percent of those being
university-related.

Questions have ranged from the
bizarre to the mundane, such as
“Where's the best place to study
during exam week?”

Have you ever wondered just
how many blades of grass there
are on the Cathedral of Learning
lawn? “That’s a pretty common
question,” Gennaula said.

But don’t think that T elefact is
all fun and games. The students
who_run the phones often have to
answer two or three calls at the
same time while using .another
phone to ﬁnd information for
people.

“A lot of people call and ask for
advice," Gennaula said. “We don’t
give opinions; it's strictly facts.”

Deep knee bends, squats,

Chris, originally from Sydney,

CA-1.4  

’Connor begins 1st termat top  

New president leads troubled university into ‘era of openness’  

Byjennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

In March Pitt’s presidential-search committee had
narrowed the ﬁeld of candidates down to 15 finalists. J.
Dennis O’Connor was not among them.

O’Connor, who at that time was vice chancellor of _

academic affairs at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, had declined an invitation to apply for the
Pitt presidency.

“I have a wonderfully framed letter that I am bringing
out to Pitt in which I declined the invitation to consider
Pittsburgh,” O’Connor said.

In March the search committee called O’Connor to ask
him if he would reconsider. Committee members ﬂew
down to UNC to talk with O’Connor face .to face, and
O’Connor agreed to take a look at Pitt’s campus.

“The rest is history,” O’Connor said.

O‘Connor, 49, has earned rave reviews since his arrival
on campus on Aug. 1. '

“I think of him in superlatives. I think he is just the kind
of thing we need at the University of Pittsburgh at this
point in time. I like him as a person, ‘and I like his
administrative style. I like the confidence that he has in
himself and his sense of the strength of the institution,"
Pitt Provost Donald Henderson said.

In his dealings with university leaders O’Connor has
been “relaxed, open, firm, straightforward, personable,
supportive, sensitive and responsive,” Henderson said.
“He is going to be a great president for the University of

. Pittsburgh. He has all the right qualities that are appropriate

to the institution at this point in its existence.”
\ O’Connor’s performance also elicited praise from former
colleagues.

Ben Tuchi, UNC vice chancellor for business and ‘

finance, said O’Connor had excellent relations with the

' UNC faculty.

“He has the capacity to listen. He has a good sense of
humor, which takes the strain out of some difficult
conversations around budget time," Tuchi said. ,

UNC student-body President Matt Heyd also praised
O’Connor’s work. O’Connor worked hard to find creative
and thoughtful solutions to UNC’s budget problems last
year, Heyd said.

O'Connor‘ introduces new athletic director Ovaljaynes at a press conference in August.

“O’Connor is hard-working. He has an
extremely forceful and impressive
personality," Heyd said.

Born and raised in Chicago, Ill., O’Connor
is a first-generation college‘ graduate. He
earned his bachelor’s degree in biology from
Loyola University, his master’s degree from
De Paul University and his doctorate from
Northwestern University.

“If there were other degrees, I could have
made it through all of the schools in Chicago,”
O’Connor said.

O’Connor began his career in education at
the University of California at Los Angeles,
where he was an assistant professor of zoology
and then an associate professor of biology.

O’Connor’s first administrative position was
the chairperson of UCLA’s biology department,
a post he kept from 1979 until 1981. O’Connor
then went to UNC, where he was the dean of
the graduate school and vice chancellor for
research and graduate studies until becoming
provost in 1988.

O’Connor comes to Pitt in the wake of
several administrative scandals and public
outcry lover former Pitt President Wesley
Posvar’s multimillion-dollar retirement
package.

“If there are difficulties, I will inform myself
about them and then resolve them,—” O’Connor
said shortly after he accepted the presidency
in May. ‘

O’Connor also has to deal with balancing
the university’s teaching and research missions. Teaching
and research are complementary, according to O’Connor.

“Research is to teaching as sin is to confession,”
O’Connor has often said. “If you don’t do one, you have
absolutely nothing to say in the other.” _

Teaching will be part of O’Connor’s personal plans in
the spring term, when he is scheduled to teach a graduate
seminar in developmental biology.

Jason Billings/The Pitt News

Jn illings/The Pitt News

J. Dennis O'Connor: I have just always enjoyed the

academic environment. I have just enjoyed learning. I
don’t know how to describe it — and maybe I am using
the wrong example —‘— but can you think of a time in your

 

15.;

education, in your_ development, where you have really 115»

been struggling with an issue, whether it is the meaning

of a particular poem, whether it is trying to solve a
quadratic equation, whether you are trying to understand
really what a filmmaker is trying to do? And finally,
something falls in place,  and all of a sudden it’s, “Ah!
of course,” like the light bulb goes on? Do you remember
what it felt like? It is just like a great feeling where
you really have a sense of happiness.

Can you imagine being in an institution like
Pitt or Northwestern or the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill or the University of

lab with a cup of coffee in your hand  and
somebody comes out of the lab and has little
crystals of something that has never before
existed on this planet? It has been synthesized for
the first time by means of a whole new chemical
approach. [...l

It is so exciting to be with those people.
Universities are the exciting places in‘American
society. It is where things happen, usually for the
first time.

PN: What were some of the decisions that led _

DO: I think about a year ago I said to my wife,
“You know, I think I would like to be president
of a university. I have been second in command
of the chief operating officer for three years, and
it would be fun to do that."

Relative to Pittsburgh, there are three or four
attributes of a university that needed to exist
before I would be interested. One, it had to be an
American Association of Universities institution,
and Pittsburgh is. It had to be a place where a lot
of exciting scholarship occurs. It had to be a
place that was serious about its instructional
mission.

The second characteristic was that it had to
have a health-affairs center. It had to have the full
scope of human health affairs. And that was both

-because of my own interest as a scientist and

because of my wife’s interest in oncology nursing.

And the third attribute was that it had to be a

happens to reflect an interest that I have in athletics. It
also happens to reflect, I think, a sense that one can_ have
competitive athletics and still operate a very clean
program. ,

The fourth attribute  was that it needed to be in or
very close to a vibrant urban metropolis. My wife and I
were both born and raised in Chicago, have lived in Los
Angeles and then spent some time in a small university
town, and we have realized that we are basically city
people. We enjoy the vibrancy of a city.

PN: Was the medical center especially inﬂuential in
your decision to come to Pitt?

DO: I have to talk to the people in the medical center
because I really like the term “health center” a lot better.
It reflects a lot more of not just the medical model of,
“You’re ill — we will treat you," but the term “health
affairs” or “health center" really reﬂects a very important
turn in American health policy. It reﬂects wellness
promotion and disease prevention as opposed‘ to a
medical intervention for treatment. But to answer your
question specifically, the existence of a school of dentistry,
medicine, nursing, pharmacy, taken in alphabetical order,
was very important. ‘ ’

PN: Have you seen the memo that former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar sent to Pitt medical center
President Thomas_ Detre concerning . the
communication problems between the medical.
center and the rest of the university?

DO: I have looked at it briefly after it was given to me,
and it is now among three or four memos on my desk that
I have to look at in more detail.

PN: In your past positions at other universities have
you found similar problems of communication
between a medical center and the rest of the
university? '

DO: I don’t want to limit it just to the medical center. I
think communication at an institution like this, as complex

and as diffuse as it is, is sometimes difficult. I think

communication can be made less difficult if it is clear from
the start that there is an organiiational structure by which
issues that affect the university get discussed. I will be
putting together that kind of organization,,where_regardless

~e of whether it is a purchase of property or the construction

of property or whether it is some ‘other issue, the
university community will have to discuss it. It is not just
the law school that is going out and buying a piece of land
or the business school that is having a program in
Czechoslovakia. Those things have to be discussed in a
broader context.

Speciﬁcally, vis-a—vis the medical
center, yes. I think there‘was a
lapse in communication.

PN: Many people have blamed
the recent controversies
concerning the misuse of money
by the Golden Panthers and the
food service on a lack of checks
and balances in the university
structure. This restructuring or
this reorganization that you are
talking about, how would that
try to combat some of those
problems?

DO: I can’t discuss in any detail the
events that have been going on in
Pittsburgh over the past months or
years. I do not think that it is just a
past-few—months issue; I think there
is just a general reluctance to put
issueson the table for discussion.
What I would really like to do is just
simply at the outset indicate that
issues are going to be put out on
the table and questions of student _
services, questions of libraries, '  " "
questions of how professional
schools interact with the college, _
issues that the college has, they're going to be put out on
the table, and they are going to be discussed. 1 would like
to have informatiorl’ available to a broader constituency.

PN: Having watched what happened in the last few
months of Dr. Posvar’s tenure, do you have any
specific feelings about how he was treated,
speciﬁcally concerning the retirement package? Do—
you think the treatment he received was fair?

DO: That is a.fair question, but I don’t know if my
response to it is particularly relevant. It was -unfortunate

 

 

that at the end of what I think was largely a good term as
president that, issues came to the fore that perhaps
tarnished that image a bit. ‘

My thought on the compensation issue, I guess, is that
my opinion isn’t really relevant. That was an action taken
between Dr. Posvar and the board. I certainly intend no
such conversations on my own behalf.

On the other two ‘issues that have received public
attention, I think it is unfortunate that ._.. the food-service
issue and the Golden Panther issueoccurred. I think it is
unfortunate, but I must say that in some sense it is a bad
news/good news situation. I cannot deny that the bad
news is that they occurred; I think the good news is that
they were caught by internal processes. Now maybe we
have to look at those processes so that we not only catch

it,-but also prevent it-,-..and I think that is really where th

thrust of my attention is going to be. . »

PN: On that issue of compensation, there have been
a few letters in the university’s paper, The
University Times, questioning the $8,000 annuity
that your wife Anne will be receiving from the

  
   

university. Have you seen those letters in that
publication? What response do you have to the
criticisms that are coming up? I

DO: I have not seen the letters myself, but I have heard
them referredto. That annuity was not something that we
requested. It was offered to ‘us, and we accepted. I will
also say that lthink it probably represents a trend in
higher education to somehow publicly offer a

, acknowledgement in some form [for] the contribution

that a spouse makes to an institution. So it was not

I something that we sought.

PN: You publicly disclosed your salary when the a
Board of Trustees refused to. You have also indicated I
that you will not be using the chauffeur that the  ”

university offered. These are some of the things that
have made people think that your management

style is going to be a lot different than Dr. Posvar’s. ,

How would you describe what your management

style is, and how will it be more open than Dr..

Posvar’s?

DO: I guess one could characterize a management style ‘ I

as being opened or closed. I just tend to think that in

general, I tend to share my views, and I tend to look to’

others to inform my decision. So I guess if that means
open, then I am. I tend to think in terms of leaner
administrations in which perhaps more is asked of each
individual, butin turn Ithink the positions may be a little
bit more rewarding because they are a little bit more
diverse. I guess openness has been the term that has most
come up in reference to my management style, and that
tends to cause in me a thought that says, “Well, if that is

Academic secrets...
Finding a semester’s Worth of books without paying for them

By Mark Carlin
For The Pitt News

You’ve been standing in line for hours.
The stack of books under your arm weighs
more than your roommate. Standing behind
you is a guy discussing the Color of last
night’s vomit, and in front of you is a
couple is arguing about its favorite
characters on “General Hospital.” Finally,
somebody cracks and is hauled out of line,
screaming, “I should have gone to truck-
driver school!”

It’s time to buy textbooks again. If you

want to avoid this scene, here are some
suggestions to help ease the frustration.

Borrowing books from the library can
decrease book costs. The University Library
Systems, Carnegie Libraries of Pittsburgh
and Carnegie Mellon’s library system have
extensive collections that are all on or
close to campus.

Most of- the local libraries do not carry
basic introductory texts, but you can find
almost everything else.

Most textbooks are available fora two-
hour loan from the reserve desk, which is
located on the ground floor of Hillman

Library.

If forced to buy from the University
Book Center, be sure to buy only what
you need for classes you’re not going to
drop. You only have 17 days from the
beginning of the term to return a textbook,
and you must have a receipt, add-drop
form and student ID to get a full refund.
Otherwise, you can only sell the book,
back at a greatly reduced price.

If possible, get a copy of the course
syllabus before you go shopping for books.
If the syllabus lists several books, only buy
those that will be used early in the term.

The musty World of used books

4 By Mark Carlin

For T be Pitt News

Used-book stores may be just what you’re
looking for if you love to read (or just need
books for your classes) but are annoyed by

colorless, institutional bookstores with indifferent

staffs and overpriced books.

Squirrel Hill is just a short drive, walk or bus
ride away from Oakland and has three well-
stocked and well-maintained used—book stores.

Schoyer’s Books (521-8464) on South Negley

Avenue is a pure joy for any used-book freak.‘

From the moment you open the front door, you
are immersed in an atmosphere of old and
cared-for books — a terriﬁc contrast to the
sterile and crowded University Book Center.

Schoyer’s is especially proud of its history
collection, with special emphasis on Pennsylvania
history and 19th-century history books. Schoyer’s,
owned by Donnis de Camp and Marc Salvaggio,
is _the only used-book store in Pittsburgh that is
a member of the Antiquated Booksellers
Association of America.

Since Schoyer’s is a member of ABAA and
advertises in several trade magazines, it offers
the best book search available in the city.

The Bookworm on Murray Avenue in Squirrel
Hill provides a terrific mix of distractions. The
Bookworm shares its space with Heads Together,
and the two stores offer new and used books,
alternative magazines, music and videos.

Jeff Levenson, one of the proprietors, said, “A
student can look for books for class or for
pleasure and if tired of studying, get a video or
[compact disc] to relax with.”

If you’re looking for something in particular,

the Bookworm can either order a new copy or
look for the title among the used~books. The
Bookworm’s staff is larger than those at most
used-book stores.

The Tuckers, also located on Murray Avenue,
is wonderfully dusty and densely packed with
books.

The Tuckers also does book searches for
hard-to—find or out-of-print titles, but it may take
a considerable amount of time to ﬁnd ones that
are accessible.

The newly opened Caliban Book Shop on
South Craig Street in Oakland carries a general
stock, with paperbacks priced at less than $3
and few books priced above $20. Caliban also
carries rare books, like a first edition of T wain’s
Huckleberry Finn priced at $2,500 and a papal
history from 1551.

The Bryn Mawr—Vassar Book Store on Winthrop
Street, just a half—block off South Craig, is
another resource for students to buy second
hand books at reasonable prices.

The store, which benefits a scholarship fund
for students at Bryn Mawr and Vassar colleges,
is closed for restocking and will re—open on Sept.
3. '

City Books on East Carson Street in the South
Side offers the city’s largest used—book collection,
with over 30,000 volumes. City Books has a

particularly strong philosophy section, but with I

as many books as it has, there are a lot of well-
stocked sections. ‘ _
City Books’ proximity to_ the Beehive
coffeehouse provides a convenient opportunity
to buy a book and then enjoy it over some coffee
and a pastry. I I

You may want to go to your first class

Disgruntled profs leave Pitt

' By David T. Welch

Smﬂ Writer

Lucrative offers from other universities have

'. lured away several Pitt faculty members, and

others have retired with bitter feelings about the

_ controversies that have surrounded the university.

English Professor Emeritus Walter Evert said
the problem with faculty salaries makes it difficult
to retain professors. “The English department
was understaffed 20 to 25 years ago, and it still

“is,” he said.

_ Van Hall, who will be chairperson of the
history department this fall, said he foresees a
problem with retaining professors because of
low salaries.

“There is an [American Association of
Universities] ranking of roughly 60 universities.

» Our salaries rank in the high 405 or low 505.

Because of that the place is going to have a
drainage. Pitt can’t compete with some other
schools," Hall said.

But low salaries rarely cause faculty members
to leave Pitt, said Peter Koehler, dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

“Most. of the recent faculty vacancies were
caused by retirements or termination of contracts.
A few faculty left to accept positions at more
prestigious universities, and ‘others are lured
away to comparable or lesser universities by
offers of chaired or named professorships or
administrative positions..

“In all of these cases, faculty members’ positions
were based on a combination of factors that
included their perception of the national ranking
of the new institution in their discipline. Of
course salary is an important factor, but not the

decisive one. Overall, FAS has been very
successful in head—to-head competition with

other universities who have attempted to recruit

V our star faculty,” Koehler said.

I

Douglas Gale, a former economics professor,
left because he was offered “an enhanced
position at Boston University,” acting economics
department Chairperson Herbert Chesler said.

But Chesler said comparatively low salaries at
Pitt have not severely hurt his department.

“The professors are not highly paid. But the
[economics] department has committed itself to
doing a considerable amount of hiring, and we
have hired a considerable number of people in
the past five years. We are very competitive

[with other departments] at the level of professors

and senior professors,” Chesler said.

The economics department is notunderstaffed,
but “there is a limit to what can be paid,”
according to Chesler. ,

Peter Harrigan, a theater-arts lecturer and
director of Pitt mainstage productions such as

Blood Relations and last fall’s A Lie of the Mind, _

left Pitt “because he received a better offer at a
private school in Vermont. The school was also
his alma mater,” theater arts department
Chairperson Attilio Favorini said.

The political—science department has generally
been able to retain its staff, according to political
science Chairperson Guy Peters. '

“Since I have been chair, six people have had
formal offers, and of the six, five have been
retained. That's a pretty good batting average.
The salaries are low, but the university has been
responsive to its professors who receive other
offers,” Peters said.

_While Peters said his department has done
well in retaining its members, “if the salaries

weren’t such, people probably wouldn't be

looking for other offers.”

A total of 26 professors have left in the past
year. __ _ ”
Evert took an early retirement last September.
“I have" been at.Pitt since 1963. I felt I was not

Psych students learn
fundamentals at WPIC

By Catherine Goldstein
Staff Writer

“You’re walking into a crowded
room, and you see a pretty girl
coming over to you, and she says
hello. What do you do?”

This is just -one of many
scenarios presented to
schizophrenic patients by Jodi
Shenza, a’ former intern atWestern
Psychiatric Institute & Clinic.

“Some of the responses were
good, but some were completely
unrelated to the. subject. One
person said, ‘My boss is going to
kill me.’ Really strange things
happened to me, but I’m not sure
it I should or can say what they
were, exactly.”

Shenza is one of the 75 to 100
undergraduate psychology majors
who take part each year in a
three-credit internship program
at WPIC known as supervised
field placement.

Jerry Wessel, who graduated in
April with a master’s degree in
social work/mental health, did
his eight—month fieldwork at the
Family Therapy Center.

The program involved family-
therapy sessions in a room with a

‘ one-way mirror. While Wessel

conducted the sessions, he was
supervised by 8‘ to’ 10 observers
who monitored his work. After
he spoke with a family, he would
present all of his information to a
trained psychiatrist, and together
they would come up with a
diagnosis.

“It was very tough and
demanding for many reasons. To
begin with, it was 24 hours a
week, which turned out to be
three nights a week, and that was
difﬁcult, considering I was a full-
time student,” Wessel said.

“Also, I was very nervous being
in front of the mirror, conducting
a session with 10 people
evaluating my every move.
Everything we did was supervised.
Aside from that, it was an
incredible experience. As far as
theeducational part, it was the
best part of the four years of

college I spent, and of the two-
year graduate program. It really
enforced the fact that this is what
I want and like to do. The best
part is that I got hired right away
by the Family Therapy Center,”
Wessel said.

Caroline Hughes, another
recent graduate of the master’s
program, completed‘ her field
work by facilitating group therapy
at the Pregnancy and Infant Parent
Center. All of her sessions were
videotaped and evaluated by a
supervisor.

“It was a terrific internship in
terms of its educational values
and the facilities. It’s a great
experience for students because
of the nurturing environment, and
I would recommend it to anyone,”
Hughes said.

Millie Sucov, director of ‘

educational support and
volunteer services at WPIC, said
volunteers also give tours to
families of newly admitted
patients, comfort families in the
emergency room and tutor
adolescent patients.

Once accepted into the
program, students are expected
to complete 120 hours of
observation of psychological
procedures. Pam Perlow worked
with children. who suffered from
Attention Deficit Disorder.

“We administered IQ tests,
personality tests, and then we
would score their results. The
scoring got a little bit bo_ring, but
we put together training films on
how to administer the various
tests, and that was really
interesting and fun.”

All of the students, whether
they are interning or just
volunteering, must be trained
before doing any work at Western
Psych.’ Perlow was extensively
trained by a doctor. She
practiced with her immediate
supervisor, then with another
student. She was videotaped with
her partner and critiqued by the
supervisor.

“A lot of‘ one-on—one with the
kids was involved as well. For
example, we would show them a
picture and they would tell us
what was wrong with it.”

Donald McBurney, associate
chair of the psychology
department, said the ‘students’
lack of expertise limits them in
their work. I .

“They are not professionals and
obviously are not qualified to
take part in some things that go
on. There is also the question of
confidentiality to be considered,”
McBurney said.

Following their observations
they are to report to someone
who has psychological
experience, such as a Ph.D., and

, to keep a journal. Once the field

placement is finished, each,
student is required to write a
report summarizing their
experience, and they must do
library research. “This is to
demonstrate that not only do
they have a practical

understanding, but also a

theoretical understanding of what

they have done,” McBurney said.

then measure the amount of saliva
produced by those foods.

“We're looking for the factors
that make people want to eat
more even after they're full,” said
Sheri Mitchell, a research associate
with the project.

The amount of saliva produced
in the mouth is apparently an
indicator of the brain's hunger
signals, she said.

“Eating isn’t necessarily hunger-
driven. We're trying to find out
the psychological triggers to

eating behaviors,” Mitchell said.

While you won’t get rich on
spit, this study does pay up to $20
for the study’s four hours.

PlTTSBURGH’S ORIGINAL SLEEP SHOPS

  _S__l_g_epwell

Students often confuse the University of I -

Pittsburgh Press with The Pitt News or Central
Printing, much to the chagrin of the Press’
promotion director, Peter Oresick.

“We would like students to be aware that,
within certain fields, we have a reputation that
is both national and international,” Oresi ck said. A

The Press’ best—selling book of all time, Outof
This Furnace, a novel by the late Thomas Bell,
chronicles the lives of a Braddock steel worker
and his family. First published in 1941 by Little,
Brown and Co., it was reissued by the Press in
1976. Having already sold over 20,000 copies,
the book’s S0-year commemorative edition is
now in print.

David Demarest,'a professor of English at
Carnegie Mellon University, wrote in an
afterword for the 1976 edition of Out of This
Furnace that -the novel is one of the most
successful fiction books ever published by a
university press.

Pittsburgh Then and Now, The Press’ best
seller of 1990, is a pictorial history of the
Pittsburgh area, matching; photos from 1885 to
1959 with present-day shots taken from the
same angle. The book is the work of Arthur G.
Smith, a professor of history at Chatham College.

The Press’ Pitt Poetry Series publishes the
work of many award-winning poets, such as
Belle Waring, whose collection of poems titled
Refugewas selected by Publishers Weeklyas one
of the best books of 1990. 7

According to Waring, “If you haven’t ever
tried to publish a collection of poetry,‘-the odds
are against you  When you do get published 
and by someone like Pitt, you feel as if you
should sacrifice a goat or something.”

Some of the Press’ non—ﬁction is also widely

’ known. Pitt English Professor Lee Gutkind wrote

Many Sleepless Nights, an account of organ-
transplantation surgery in Pittsburgh, which has
been published internationally.

Gutkind said that when publishing with the
Press, he knows they will produce “a very high-

feel good. They will also keep your book in
print." A commercial press can take a book out
of print in six months, Gutkind said.

Writers hoping to publish with the Press
customarily send a letter and a table of contents.
“When an editor here thinks a book sounds
promising, we will ask to see the manuscript.
We then send it to three outside readers for
professional opinions,” said Oresick.

At this point, the Press submits the manuscript
to a special committee of the University Senate.
The senate usually approves the manuscript,
according to Oresick. “Rejection of a manuscript
hasn’t happened for a long, long time.”

Like the English or history department, the
Press is an academic division of the university,
according to Oresick. The only difference is that
the Press generates income through sales.

“All university presses, because of the kinds
of books we publish, never make enough to
offset publishing costs. The university makes
up the difference,” Oresick said.

Established in 1936 as a publisher of books
about western Pennsylvania, today the Press
mainly publishes scholarly works.

“We do many Ph.D. dissertations, often hard-
cover, 200, to 300 pages,” said Oresick. “This is
the way we exist — for_ a very specialized
academic audience. Commercial publishers
couldn't afford to do this.”

‘The Press is well-known in academic circles
for its Latin American series, its Pittsburgh series
in Bibliography and _its Milton studies series.

Despite its concentration on “narrow, scholarly
works,” as Oresick calls them, the Press still
publishes many regional works, as well as a
“potpourri” of works in fiction, -poetry, natural
history, philosophy, ‘mental health and
anthropology. American Bookseller recently
named the Pitt Poetry Series among the five
best publishers of American poetry.

In its 55-year existence, the Press has published
over about 50 new books a year, over 850
publications. Over 400 volumes are now in
print.

For The Pitt News 9

Confused about what you want
to do with your life? Unsure of
what your major should be?
Before calling a psychic, you
might want to consider six majors
in the College of Arts and Sciences
that have provided these answers
for many students. ‘

CAS offers degrees through over‘
50 departments to 10,242 students,
according to spring 1991 statistics
from CAS. Almost 30 percent of
these students majored in
psychology, communications,

English, liberal studies, political
science or the business dual-major
program.

Psychology is the largest major
in CAS, with 574 students. lt’s
traditionally been one of the most
popular majors in the nation, and
Pitt is no exception, said Donald
McBurney, associate chairperson
of the psychology department.

“Psychology is intrinsically
interesting because it has a lot to
do with why people do what
they do,” McBurney said.

Many students first get
interested in psychology after
taking Introduction to

Psychology, one of the most
popular classes at Pitt.

“The enrollment in Psych 10 is
so big that a colleague of mine
has said it seems as if every
student at Pitt must take it twice,”
McBurney said.

Communications, with 538
stu dents divided between rhetoric
and communications and
communications science, is the
second—largest program in CAS.

The skills developed while
studying communications can
help students ﬁnd jobs, according
tojohn Gareis, a communications
adviser.

Milt
Continued from page A-6
He belongs to the Pittsburgh

Men’s Collective, “a group of men
who  promote an image of men
which is exactlyopposite to the
macho image: men can be caring;
they can nurture each other; they
can cry, and they can even /be
wrong.”

Milt observed that most men
don’t have friends. “They have
men they go out bowling with,
but not real friends.”

The men in the collective

discuss subjects ranging from.

fathers (“My father was never
there for me. He was always
working or playing cards”) to
Yhelma and Louise (“The general
tenor I liked, but I was repelled
by the violence”).

He was arrested about 10 years
ago for protesting the U.S. policy
in Central America. His son Russ,
the state policeman, didn’t
approve.

“We just blockaded the State
Building  The handcuffs were
painful. I don’t know whether

they did it on purpose,” Milt said. '

Milt "does a little escorting at
clinics" where abortions are
performed. "The main emphasis
is no confrontation. We form a

ring around the women and then
walk in  Pro-choice people are
not pro—abortion, but they do
believe it's a woman's choice."

He's campaigned for Eugene
McCarthy, George McGovern and
City Council member Jim Ferlo.
Milt knewFerlo "when he first
came to Pittsburgh." They
boycotted grapes together. And
then Ferlo was elected and "ruined
Milt's record" of supporting
candidates who didn't win.

During World War II Milt
entered military intelligence by
chance. “I’m a paciﬁst  But I
thought [fighting] Hitler was more
important, so I e_nlisted. They
sent me to weather school, so I
became a meteorologist. There
were 800 of us, and when we got
through, they said they didn’t
need any of us.  We decided
where, we wanted to be
transferred to  And that being
the Army, they went right through
the alphabet. The end of the
alphabet went into intelligence.”

When he got out of the Army,
he earned a master’s degree in
chemical engineering from
Columbia University and worked
for the Bureau of M ines for about
nine years.

Helen Wolfson met her future
husband in 1967 at a Parents
Without Partners meeting
attended by “S4 women and 3
men. They weren’t too great,
either,” she said.

They were married in 1968. “I
guess we hit it off pretty well_,”
Helen said. She has two daughters
and a son, and Milt has four sons.

She described their relationship
as balanced. “Milt’s a very gentle,
trusting man. He wants very much
to give and give and give and
give  I don’t care much about
the faceless hordes. I'm not a
ﬂaming liberal.”

Milt and a group for peace in
Central America fitted about 700
people in Nicaragua for
eyeglasses about three years ago.
“That’s the best vacation I’ve had
in a long time,” he said.

Helen’s emphatic about why
she didn’t go along.

“If I’m going out of the country,
I’ll go to the Riviera. Hell with
that  I thought he’d catch
something dreadful down there,”
she said.

Helen described working in
their garden as “therapy. You
pull weeds instead of ripping out
hearts. It’s so much safer.”

“In January of '89, a poll was
conducted. Researchers
interviewed 1,000 personnel
directors from major
corporations, and they asked
them what they looked for in
potential employees. The top
three responses were speaking,
writing and interaction skills.
Communications gives a good
grounding in all those areas,”
Gareis said.

English comes in third with
547 students. The English
department offers degrees in
three programs: English writing,
English literature and ﬁlm studies.

Psychology, communications most popular majors

English writing majors far
outnumber lit and film-studies
majors, said Fred Koloc, director
of CAS academic advising. Lit
and ﬁlm-studies majors tend to
love the topic they are studying
and often go into graduate work
or education, according to Koloc,

The business dual-major
program is the next largest, with
473 students. The business dual-
major combines a business
degree with‘ a CAS major.

Smo/emg entices college students

By Catherine Goldstein
Stqﬁ‘ Writer

So you’ve ﬁnally done it. You’ve
moved away from the tight
clutches of your parents and into
your pie—shaped room on the
15th floor of Tower A. As the

family station wagon drives off ’

into the sunset, there’s a tear in

A your mom’s eye — her baby is

finally growing up.
With a newfound feeling of
freedom, independence — and a

' terrible craving fora cigarette —

you make yourway to the nearest
7—Eleven.

A few minutes and a couple of
"drags later, you contemplate your
new “accomplishment.” No one
said a word about your smoking;
no-one gave you a funny “you
shouldn’t be doing that” look
when you bought the cigarettes,
and you didn’t\have to worry if

‘ one of your parents’ friends saw

you or not.

Before you ru_n off to buy your
first "carton, consider this: about
350,000 people die each year

  

 

.9

from cigarette smoking.

“Kids who smoke when they're
16 more often than not will smoke
when they're 30. They just don’t

"realize the damage it can cause,”

said Karen Renfer of the American
Lung Association of Western
Pennsylvania.

Because thousands of people
die each day because of smoking,
the tobacco companies have to
replace their customers. This is
done through advertising, and
interestingly enough, these ads
are targeted primarily toward
young women.

' ' According to Mary Ann Valasek

of the American Lung Association
of Western Pennsylvania, women
smoke more than men, and one
of the top three reasons is
advertising.

Young women smoke or start
to smoke because of the stress in
college —— staying up late
studying, for example — or they
use it as an appetite suppressant.

Young women also tend to
smoke because of peer pressure.
“This affects people not only

sruomr DISCOUNT

when starting but when stopping
as well,” Valasek said.

Because of Pitt's no-smoking
policy, which has been in effect
since Feb. 1, students and staff
are finding it harder to continue
their habit.

“I feel that people are smoking
less during working hours.
However, I don’t know if it has
affected their ‘ cigarette-
consumption level,” said Candy
Miller of the Student Health
Center.

Although Pitt is trying to
become a smoke—free
environment, campus police are
having a tough time enforcing
the new rules.

“It is much like the jaywalking
law. There aren’t enough
university or city police to enforce
it. We haven’t fined anyone to
date, but if we see someone
smoking where they shouldn’t
be, we ask them to cease,” said
Walt Waters, assistant director of
public safety.

Telefact

Continued from page A-13
which would break an agreement between Telefact and the
faculty. She said if a student is having a problem, “a lot of times
we’ll point them in the right direction.”

T elefact answers about 80 percent of the questions right over
the phone, but Gennaula said some do require more research.
Telefact has a 24-hour callback policy if operators can’t answer
the question right away.‘

This year’s budget for Telefact is almost $39,000. It received
$15,000 from the telecommunications center at Pitt, and the
remaining money came from Student Activities.

Bruce Hutchinson, from the telecommunications department,
said Telefact “has provided a useful and needed service” to the
university and its students. Hutchinson said the
telecommunications department will continue to fund Telefact
at the current level for the next three years.

Mike Soli, asenior at Pitt and a former operator for T elefact,
said Telefact is a valuable service for students who are limited in

their access to information. He also said since the service is free '

to students, “that makes it a damn good service.”

The service is good for new students because they_don’t have
to deal with operators “with an attitude,” said Bob Wagner, a Pitt
junior. But “we’re in a money crunch, and there’s other ways of
getting the information,” he said.

Telefact hopes to make the workload a little easier on the

‘operators this year by hiring several more, bringing the total

number to nine.

The new operators will be paid $5.25 an hour, and the three
returning operators will continue to earn last year’s salary of $6
an hour. The student coordinator will earn $7 an hour.

Gennaula justified the decrease in pay because last year’s
operators had to do a lot more research. She said the decrease

' will allow T elefact to keep two operators in the office during the

busy weekday hours.

“We do have training for the operators," Gennaula said, “but
it's a lot of hands—on work." I

During the su mmerTelefact began to switch all of its information
onto CD Rom computer discs. There are about 150 different
reference books crammed into the office, which is actually
smaller than a Towers dorm room. A

“Hopefully, someday we’ll move [to a bigger officel”, Gennaula
said. .
Gennaula said Telefact hopes to be able to access PITT CAT,
the university operator and Compuserve, which offers Associated
Press news reports, financial news and other services, with the
new computer they received this year.

Telefact also hopes to have cable hook—up to Cable News .

Network, but Gennaula doesn't think it will be this year because
of the $3,000 hook—up fee by the physical plant section of the
university.

CNN would have been useful during the Gulf war because
Telefact received a lot of phone calls from students wanting to
know up-to-date information about the war, according to
Gennaula. ~ I

She said Telefact employees oftenhad to call other operators
and ask them to tune their televisions to CNN. They also used a
phone number that the Air Force gave them to help answer
questions. ' I

Gennaula said, “I see [Telefact] continuing almost forever and
expanding a lot.”»She hopes that some day students will be able
to access Telefact from their own computers and from computers
around campus.

Whatever your opinion, Telefact seems destined to stay here
at Pitt. f‘Give us a call; don’t be afraid to,” Gennaula said. “We
don’t give up, unless there’s no answer to the question.”

maximum salaries are
$18,604 and $25,584,

respectively.

Governor Robert Casey’s
new budget" increased
money for state libraries,
according to Diana Cavinee,
budget director for the
Carnegie Libraries of
Pittsburgh.

Library funding from the
city and county budgets will
not be negotiated until late
1991 or early 1992, Cavinee
said.

The Carnegie libraries’
budget is contingent upon
suffering municipality
budgets, according to
Cavinee.

“Libraries are not
suffering any more than
municipalities,” Cavinee
said. “We’re certainly in
better shape than
Philadelphia.”

Although the Carnegie
libraries received increased
funding over the past three
years, the problem has been
building over the past 20
years, said Croneberger.
“We are doing as well as
can be expected.” ‘

Inﬂation — the rising
costs of books and materials
— is the major problem.

“If we can’t get increases
to our materials budget, we
will have to face some very
tough decisions,” Cavinee
said. I

“The Carnegie libraries
are in pretty bad shape,”
Kobulnicky said.

Although the libraries at
Carnegie Mellon University
have fared better than
others in Oakland, there
have been no substantial
increases in funding at
CMU.

“Our budget will be good
for this year, but it will be

difficult to sustain over ‘

many years," said Barbara
Richards, acting director of
CMU libraries.

“We are doing somewhat
better than other libraries,
but it’s still not good,”
Richards said. “Services to
the folks who rely on
[Oakland libraries] become
more difficult.”

Kobulnicky said that
“some students may notice
that things [at Pitt libraries]
do not run, as smoothly.” ~

In order to combat the
disintegration of the
Carnegie library system,
administrators there are
now looking for alternative
ways of funding. Local
television and radio station
KDKA is advertising a
program to purchase library
books for children.

But Croneberger said
many obstacles remain. “At
the very time when citizens
of the area need access to
information on job
searching, home
provement and career
development, this is when

the library is having the

most difﬁcult time."

for the custodians, Jaros and
Blakston said.

“They leave their lunch bags
and other junk all over these
tables. We come down here at 6
o’clock every morning and clean
it up. Usually, we can fill up an
entire cart with just this junk,”
Jaros said. ‘

“They’re slobs.‘ I hope my boys
aren't like that,” Welch said. “I
came in one morning, and there

was a desk embedded in the’

wall. And there was popcorn all
over the floor and chalk all over
the place. They had wet toilet
paper on the walls. In my
stairwell, they’re urinating in there
and moving their bowels. I mean,
how long does it take to get to
the bathroom? This is, like, every
Monday.”

Sebastian Palmieri, a Benedum
Hall custodian, said, “Basically,
98 percent of the kids are good.
We’ve got to remember that after
all, they are still kids. They might
get wild once in a while, but
that’s understood because we

 ”

did the same things when we
were young.”

But Palmieri does not see the
recent Posvar incident in such an
affectionate light.

“We can put that guy in the
same class as the legislators, which
amounts to one thing: greed!”
Palmieri said.

Pitt will be hurt by the
controversy surrounding Posvar’s
retirement settlement, according
to Jaros.

“The Posvar incident will be a
major black eye that is going to
take a long time to go away,”
jaros said.

Welch said a downward trend
will follow the Posvar incident.

“I like my job, but I‘used to be
very proud of working here, too,
but not’ no more! I don’t even
want no one to know I work

here. I’m serious. It’s bad!” Welch
said.

Despite his criticism of the
university, Jaros boasted, “Pitt is
one of the few universities that

has an in-house -training
certification program for
custodians. I

“This job requires a lot of
knowledge and skill. We have
floor care; we have to know rugs
and walls,’’ Jaros said.

Custodians must dry— and wet-
mop, change lights .—and dispose
of hazardous waste, which
requires some knowledge of
chemicals, Austin said.

“Then we got our floor jobs —
each one of us has a floor. Then
we got team cleaning, where we
all take three or four ﬂoors,”
Palmieri said. '

Palmieri said “team cleaning”

  “A-25 - 

 

takes away from his floorwork,
but after 18 years with Pitt, “there

‘is really nothing here which is i

too heavy for me!”

Blakston claimed the only hard
thing about the job is “getting up
in the morning.”

“I can’t really complain about
the job,” Austin said. “Good
benefits — I raised four kids on it
and bought a house and a car. If
I’d went for a lot of other jobs, I'd
be out in the street — steelmills
and that, I mean.”

Jaros said the job/offers stability. A
“Pitt has an excellent medical’ '

plan and other great beneﬁts,
such as free tuition for your kids,
and you can go to school for five
dollars a credit.”

Both Austin and Blakston have

taken advantage of the tuition

benefits for their children, while
Jaros takes classes in hopes of
“moving up.”

Weinstein said, “The biggest
misconception about [custodians]

_is thatythey are overpaid and
‘under-worked,"but most ‘of 

work’ pretty“ hard.” 

You’ve got to love us.
You’ve got our guarantee.

on 3 June. Posvar said in a
statement he would be away on
several trips in June and July
promoting unspecified
“international and
developmental initiatives” in
preparation for his “post-
presidential services to the
university.”

-Pitt and the university medical
center both placed bids on the
Syria Mosque. Pitt offered $5.5
million to the Syria Temple
Holding Corporation for the 75-
year—old landmark, but 
mosque was sold to National
Development Corporation for
$10 million. NDC announced it
planned to raze the mosque and
build an office complex on the
site. NDC revealed the anchor
tenant of the offices was the
medical center.
June 12, 1991: _

-The president of Pitt’s Board of
Trustees said the board was
unaware of Wesley Posvar’s full
retirement package until the
terms of the settlement were
disclosed in the media. John
Marcus described the trustees as
“captives of history” who were
generally unaware of the

decisions made by a
compensation committee, which
has never made a report to the
full board of trustees.

oPitt’s general counsel said the
private interworkings of the
Board of Trustees committee
which approved Posvar’s
retirement package and recent
pay raises probably violated the
intent of the state Sunshine Act
but may not have actu ally broken
the law. The committee kept
few records and held informal
meetings, Lewis Popper said.
The Sunshine Act requires
government agencies, including
state-related universities, to open
their meetings to the public.

0 Posvar said he will repay within
six months the $700,000 low-
interest mortgage he received
from the university, and he
apologized for withholding
information from the state
legislature about his $3.3 million
retirement package.

-Pitt held its first Black Writers
Conference, featuring keynote
speaker Ntozake Shange.
°Surgeons at Presbyterian
University Hospital and
Children's Hospital of Pittsbu rgh
performed the first successful
small-intestine transplants.

June 19, 1991:

0 The Board of Trustees formed
a seven-member compensation
committee that will publicly
determine the salaries of of the
university president and other
administrators. The board also
voted to restore $230,000
diverted from the university's
libraries into a fund for low-
interest mortgages for Pitt
administrators.

-Pitt’s leading fund-raiser, Bruce
Loessin, decided to leave the
university to accept a similar
position with Case Western
Reserve University because the
offer was too good to pass up.
-A downtown parade drew
thousands to honor returning
Desert Storm veterans.

0 Pitt’s Center for the Philosophy
of Science received a $350,000
grant from the Richard King
Mellon Foundation.
June 26, 1991:

-A total of 66 books and 82
bound journals at the
engineering library were
destroyed by a substance
described in a campus police
report as “liquid feces.”

-The Committee to Save the
Syria Mosque and Pittsburgh
music lovers lost a battle

yesterday to save the 75-year-
old Oakland structure when a
Common Pleas judge ruled the
building can legally be
demolished. g
-Hundreds of Pittsburgh gays
were “out, loud and proud”
during Pride Week, which
featured the first gay and lesbian
parade since 1980.
July 3, 1991:
°The Cowell bill, which would

require Pitt and three other state— ‘

related schools to disclose their
financial records, was tabled
for several weeks.
oPittAssistantPresidentKatrina
Veeder Schulhof and two
trustees left the university.

-‘o The University Senate’s

budget-policies committee
wants a more in—depth
disclosure of Posvar’s'retirement
package and called for Posvar’s
latest raise to be taken away.
July 10, 1991:

°Despite strong community
opposition, City Council gave
final» approval to a proposed
helicopter landing pad at
Shadyside Hospital by a 5-4

—- VOIIC.

o Elexious Pefkins, a Pitt football
player and a criminal-justice
major, pleaded guilty last week

to an assault charge brought
against him by Pitt student Todd
Guthrie, 19, of Wexford.
-A downtown rally to protest
the “gag rule,” which prohibits
doctors in federally-funded
family planning clinics from
discussing abortion with their
patients, drew hundreds of pro-
choice and pro-life activists.
July 17, 1991:
oPitt Medical Center officers
often overstep the authority of
the university president,
according to a memo sent to
UPMC President Thomas Detre
by Posvar. In the 15—page
confidential memo obtained by
The Pitt News, Posvar said UPMC
officers engaged in real-estate
acquisitions against the interest
of the university and
misrepresented Pitt _ to
government officials.
oAlmost 200‘ North Oakland
residents signed a petition this
month which would ban
“cniising” in their neighborhood,
claiming that noise from car
stereos and engines kept them
awake. Dissenting, opinions

were heard at a City Council '

hearing this week.

Pitt News was July 1 7.) , »~

Majors

School of Business,“A student
interested in banking will often
major in economics, and a student
interested in international banking
will often major in a foreign
language,” he said..

Liberal studies, which allows
students to design their own
majors, is the next—largest CAS
program, with 399 students.

Political science is sixth with
471 students. Robert Donaldson,
major adviser to political-science

undergraduates, said, "‘We have
a department that ' takes
undergraduate teaching pretty
seriously  and students’ are
attracted by that. A lot of our stu-
dents are as good as any you will

find anywhere,” Donaldson said. ,

Pitt’s area—studi'es programs can
be added to a political science
degree and may be a major reason

why Pitt’s political-science

department has become a strong
recruiting ground for the U.S.
government.

MYTH :

“You can tell if someone has an STD (Sexually
'_l'_ransmitted Qisease) just by looking at them.”
The truth is that any sexually active person is at risk for a
sexually transmitted disease. A person can have an STD, sho\_~
ng symptoms at all and pass it to their sex partners. If you're ,

, concerned about STDs, the Allegheny County Health
Department's STD clinic provides  I
screening and treatment for STD. We also offer free and
confidential testing for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. We're
located on Forbes Avenue, in the heart of Oakland.

Smoking

Continued from page A-24
Haberman conducted a study at
Pitt in 1989, and only 10 percent
of the students reportedly
smoked.

“The national college average
is 37 percent, so Pitt is way below
the mean,” I-Iaberman said.

Senior Dave Kerskey said he
didn’t start smoking until last year.

“All of my friends smoke, and
it was mainly out of curiosity that
I started. In high school, very few
people smoked and so many
looked down upon it. But in
college it became so accepted
and accessible that
psychologically I came to accept

it as well. Unfortunately, itbecame
a habit.”

Renfer said, “What we need to
do is educate people before they
start. There are a lot of programs
to help those who want to help
themselves as well as those
around them. For example, we
have tobacco-free teams and other
clinics to help people stop
smoking.”

Although it’s easier to smoke
away from home, smoking
promotes lung cancer and other
diseases (just read the surgeon
general’s warning on the side of
any pack of cigarettes). it’s also
difficult to quit when you’re older.

field placement is not
referred to as an internship
so that it can be
distinguished from the
graduate—level internships.
Students must have a
certain amount of
psychology credits and
have taken both Abnormal
and Personality Psych.

“I think it should be
required [for psych majors]
because it’s such a
wonderful experience. It
made me want to go all the
way with psychology,”
Shenza said.

Eating

Continued from page A- 18
Deskins said.

Not just any boxed cereal will
do, however.

Any cereal with sugar, syrup or
corn sweetener as its first or
second ingredient should be
avoided.

Usually. the sugar content of
such cereals comprises
approximately halftheir weight;
so when purchasing a cereal,
students should make sure that it
contains no more than 7-percent
sugar.

“It pays to read the label
because some of them really have
lots of nutrients  For example,

 

 

_iJIM’S"SERVICE STATION 

—  .3:
Serving Oakland,

young women in particular have
difficulty getting enough iron in
their diets, so it’s important that
they pick a cereal that’s fortified
with iron," Deskins said.

The Student Health Service
offers all students the services of
Patty Verdi, a registered dietician,
as well as a pamphlet entitled,
“Keeping The Cost of Eating
Down,” which was written by
Deskins.

Students can also further their
knowledge of nutrition by
enrolling in Introduction to
Nutrition, which is offered during
the spring term and has no
prerequisites.

Continued from page A-15
commitment on the part of the
institution. I don’t know that it
does higher education generically
any good to take the only black
professor of religious studies from
Syracuse and move that person
to Pitt. What we need to dois to
formulate Pitt’s contribution to
encouraging black students to go
into higher education. And it’s
not just at Pittsburgh; it is across
the country.

How will I do it? First of all I
need to see what is in place, if
anything, and I am sure there are
some programs in place. Secondly
we need to get rising juniors and
rising seniors in college to spend
a summer doing the kinds of
activities that are done in graduate
school. This will encourage them
to attend graduate school, by
knowing what it is like, so that
during their senior year they can
begin to make plans. I

You’ve got to back it all the
way down the line. You’ve got to

:5 back it to the high schools, so that

they are interested in coming to

' Pittsburgh because there are
programs here that they know
that they like and in which they
can succeed. We’ve got to put
support structures in there for all
of the students, not just for
minorities.

But that is a situation that
requires K—through—12 in-
vqllvement; V “ it requires
undergraduate involvement, and
it "requires graduate-school

' involvement. And even more so

it requires post—doctoral studies.
What about getting some of those
bright minority students that are
just finishing their Ph.D. at
Southern Cal or Berkeley or
whatever and inviting them here
for two years as post—doctoral
scholars so that they can finish
that book that is going to come
out of their thesis?

What is the first thing that
happens to a black biochemist
when they arrive on campus?

qThey’re put on some minority

committee, and they end up
getting enormously utilized in
that kind of arena rather than

having some peace

6 

programs that you

and quiet so that they
can get their scholarly
record on the road.
All of those things
need to be addressed.
But make no mistake
— it is not a short-
term fix. It is going to
require a long-term
commit—ment. That is
the only way it works.

it.

Part of what I would like . to
accomplish is  a sense of
participation and a sense that the
university is healthy and that it is

plan to bring to Pitt
from those other
' universities?
DO: No, I don’t. I
think one of the
characteristics that I
have learned as an
administrator is that
you need to learn
with the strengths of
the institution. You
need to work with

PN:Whileyou were
on campus inter-
viewing for the
presidency, you mentioned
that you had mixed feelings
about the controversy
surrounding the conflict
between the Department of
Defense’s policy of excluding
homosexuals and the non—.
discrimination policies that
many universities have.
SincePitt’sUniversitySenate
has recommended that ROTC
be removed from‘ campus in
1997, if the DOD does not
change its policy and the
decision is now yours, what
are your views on the senate’s
recommendations?
DO: My feelings really haven’t
changed since April. I think in
that conversation I indicated that
had I been asked that question
six years ago, my answer would
have been very straightlorward.
Certainly my experiences in North
Carolina and the importance of
the ROTC program to the students
at Chapel Hill, the importance of
the Army to the community, the

impact that the--Persian Gulf- war ~ :

had on Chapel Hill, have certai nly
caused me to rethink my position
vis-a-vis the ROTC, and I will
continue to rethink it as we get
involved in those discussions.

I do not want it to sound in any
way as though I am in favor of
discrimination. I am not. I would
just like to talk through what the
implications are of a policy_that
would lead to the eliminatiof) of
ROTC on this campus. I don't
know the answer to‘ it, and it
won’t be the last time you hear
me say that.  -

 ’

PN: You were a basketball

A player while you attended

Loyola University. In your past
administrative positions have
you had any experience
dealing with student athletes?
What are your feelings on the
issues surrounding student
athletes?
DO: I have been involved with
student athletes at both
institutionsthat I have been at. I
assume that you are referring to
what some people see as an
impossible situation with an
individual being both a student
and an athlete. Although I think
it may be diffieultlifor a number of
reasons, I ce’rta,inl’y;_tl1ink it is still
possible.  .. , 
And I will  quite ‘frankly to
the fact that if one uses, for
example, graduationrates as a
kind of indicator, the other

institutions at which I have been _

have done well with their students
as athletes. Iunderstand that there
are some times, for example, if
one is.traveling, that itcan be
difficult to accomplish what you
need to accomplish as a student
— and yet it is not impossible.
You just have to be sensitive to
those issues and develop the right

kind of program, and I think that ‘

the new athletic director is
sensitive to those issues and will
help to develop or enhance the
existing programs.

an administrator at two other

what the institution
wants to -do.

I don't think it
would be appropriate for me to
come in and say, “Well what we
really need here is a world-class,
high—energy physics department
with a superconducting
supercollider.” That may not be
where the strengths of our physics
and our chemistry department
are.

I think what a thoughtful
administrative leadership team
does is to find out ‘what the
students, what the faculty, what
the staff are interested in
developing —— what they see as
strengths, what they see as
deficiencies, what * they would
like to correct and to work with
them to go in those directions.

PN: How do  to feel
out what those problems and
strengths are?

DO:,Spend a lot of time listening
for a while and asking people just
those questions. What are the
strengths of the institution, and_

where is M it that you see the
institution? I have already "met ..

with the staff advisory committee"
and their leadership, and I have
met with the academic sena
leadership. =
All of these obviously are entry-
level conversations, but they are
conversations which need to be
initiated, which they have been,
and they need to continue. I will
be doing that with student groups

when they arrive back in the fall.

Universities are remarkably
interesting places. They are very
different from manufacturing
centers. They are very different‘
from free-form artists’ camps, if
you will. But there are elements
of both of those, if those are the
ends of the spectrum, where_ the
university operates.

You are working with a bright
group of students, .a very bright
group of faculty and a very
dedicated and intelligent group
of staff.

Why not use those strengths? I
don't think leadership can
improve it. What you do is you
try to develop it, just like you do
with any bright group.

PN: At the end of your first
year, what goals do you hope
to have accomplished?

DO: Usually in coming to a
position such as this, I normally ,

Aerobics  
Continued from page A-13
aerobics properly.

He said he likes to begin every term
telling the students in his classes that they
are not in a competition’: They are here to
get in. shape and to keep their own pace.

“Seeing the people become fit” is one of
the best feelings from teaching the classes,
according to Cheryl.

Cheryl said if she’s teaching women,

‘ they feel like they should be doing the

exercises, but if Chris is teaching, they
may use his being male as an excuse not
to work as hard.

Unlike Chris, who started teaching

aerobics in Australia, Cheryl didn’t start ‘

teaching until she came to Pitt. She
explained that since she knew all of Chris’
routines, Chris made the suggestion that
she begin to teach.

“It’s very difficult when you start," she

‘ said. “It’s very difficult to think one split

second ahead because that’s when you

‘ have to tell the students what the next

move will be.”

“There’s a sudden realization when you
teach that not only do you have to do the
routine and do it right; you also have to
talk, which means that you’re not
breathing,” said Cheryl.

Since their first meeting at the
Roadrunners Club in New York City, their
relationship was strictly friendship for the
first seven months they knew each other.

“He never asked me out,” said Cheryl.
“We were really good friends.”

Although Chris will insist to this day that
he often left hints for her, he said he must
have been “Mr. Too Subtle for American
Women.”

Chris was a genetics researcher, and
Cheryl was a commercial lending officer
at Chemical Bank.‘They came from different
backgrounds — she was a young
professional, and he was “just meandering
along," he said. “I basically only saw her
running.” .

The turning point of their relationship

— although neither could explain why —
was the “Trevera T wosome,” a 10K race
for couples. After asking Cheryl to run
with him, Cheryl couldn’t make a
commitment because of work. Because of
a deadline for entering, Chris said he
finally had to ask another friend, Ann, to
enter the race with him.

Cheryl said, “Then you saw Chris and
Ann,” who is paraplegic, “together a lot.”
“He was constantly going to her place for
dinner.” ‘

Chris said he liked to help Ann.

“Maybe —I think he set the whole thing
up," Cheryl said.

She said she wasn’t really jealous, only
that Chris “sort of grew on me after
awhile.” ‘

They said running was a “great way of
meeting.” Chris said, “We saw each other
at our worst.” ,

Finally, seven months after they met,
they became a “couple.” And, in March
1987, with his research position ending,

Cash

Chris proposed to Cheryl. Chris ﬁnally



decided to come to Pittsburgh in May, ,

1987.

“At first my parents were shocked, but
they finally camearound,” said Cheryl.
“Slowly, little by little, Chris started to grow
on my mother, and she absolutely adores
him now.” _V _ d

From May 1987 until they were married
injune 1988, Chris lived in Pittsburgh, and
Cheryl stayed in New York.

“USAir showed a profit that year,” Chris
said.

After joining Chris in Pittsburgh, Cheryl
said she received a similar banking position
at Mellon Bank, but she “quickly soured
on banking.”

Cheryl went back to school and just
received her master’s in research
methodology from Pitt. She’s looking for a
research position at a college in the
Pittsburgh area. Chris continues to do
genetics research and teaches graduate
students at Pitt.

“volunteer”? CRC offers a paid
position working with a
Downtown legislative office.
Applicants mustbe familiar with
federal and state legislative and
political processes.

The job involves developing

correspondence. (And it doesn’t
involve bodily fluids.)

According to the listing, the

high pay or particular positions,

you’re not going to find jobs as ..

easily as someone willing to do

CRC has more openings in
September and October than
at any other time of the year,
Laird said.

itt swallowing Oakland la ga ooly

If you walk across Fifth Avenue to Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall and look left up the hill, it is difficult to see
a plot of land the Pitt Panther does not have its paws in.

_The university, like many others, has its share of
administrative buildings and classroom facilities. In fact,
Pitt manages several of the hospitals in the Oakland area,
which have been educating doctors and medical students
for years. '

The universityalso ‘recently bid against itself on the
Syria Mosque property (let’s not assume for a second that
it was for the building itself), raising the price an
additional $5 million. In doing so, Pitt will also demolish
a cornerstone of entertainment and culture.

Take this campus consciousness test and see how you
score.

Pitt will use the Mosque property for:

EDITORIAL

A) the construction of a new dorm, with a close
proximity to campus that will make it convenient
and safe for students.

B) the construction of additional state—of-the-art
humanities classrooms-. _

'C) a kind and long overdue gesture, as it halts

. demolition of the Mosque and uses the building for

a campus entertainment center to attract speakers
and other performers at little cost to the students,
faculty and staff.

D) a political statement when it announces that,

“We have enoughbuildings, andbesides, $10 million,

is just too damn high” and allows someone else to
have a piece of the Oakland pie. .
Your answer? ‘

Whoops. Sorry. We forgot E) an ominous ofﬂce

building with dreary pastels. \

Pitt said there are plans to use part of the new building
for a few classrooms and an auditorium, but given Pitt’s
track record on such issues as diversity in teaching and
commitment to undergraduate education, the likelihood
of there being any widespread student benefit from the

new building is about the same as getting into all of your p

required classes.
' Pitt’s monopolies began as far back as the establishment
of the university, but recently Pitt has been taking its

property power a bit too far. ,

THE PI'I'I' NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

B-'7?

 

C Democrats don 't have much of a chance in ’92

‘s

-A.
%-

I9

Well, folks, it’s that time of the
year again. Time to admire the
wonders of the American political
system, lament the apathy of
American voters, and pick a lamb-
to—the—slaughter to run against
George “Skippy” Bush.
Democrats are preferred.

Now, I fully realize that any
kind of deep, serious, political
analysis this far away from
election time would get me tarred,
feathered, and strung up by my
wisdom teeth. So, I’ll stay away
from anything like that as much
as possible.

The last time a Democrat was
in office was 1981, and that was
Jimmy Carter. Say what you want
about him as a President, but just
remember — the best follow-up
the Democrats could find for him
were Walter “Fritz” Mondale and
Michael “Waiter, there’s
something in my Harbor”
Dukakis. Sheesh. A

. The 1992 election doesn’t look
promising for the Democrats,
either. At least during most years
around this time you have the
Governor Of New York insisting,
“NO! I’m not running! Stop asking
me! Well, maybe. What?! You
picked someone else?”

Oh, people are still asking him
if he’s running, but Cuomo is
very sedate about the whole issue.
He very calmly stated the other
day that he was not running
because New York needs him.
Meanwhile people in the Empire
State insist, “No, it’s okay, Mario,
we can take care Of ourselves.”

As everyone knows, the ideal
pick for the Democratic party is
John F. Kennedy. He has universal

appeal, can bring political

warhorses like Richard Nixon to
their knees, and has grand visions
Of how to make this country
great again.

Unfortunately, he is also dead.
But you never know. This may
not stop the Democrats.

It seems that the Democrats are
doomed. How are they doing to
find a person with the capability
to defeat Bush?I think they should
run a “Help Wanted” ad in every
major newspaper. It sounds
ridiculous, but if you can get
anything from jobs to appliances
to mail—order brides in the
classified sections, why not a
presidential candidate?

The ad could read something
like this: _

“See the world! Win friends,
prestige, and $ $‘ $! Chic,
contemporary progressive
political party seeks qualiﬁed,
motivated men ands women to
run for the presidency of the
United States. Experience
preferred, but not necessary.
Salary $250K plus beneﬁts. Send
resume with photo tO:”

‘Well, you get the idea. The
Democrats seem pretty desperate.
They even asked me to consider
taking the nomination. I would
have been glad to, but the
Constitution prohibits more than
one humorist from running for
political office per election, and
Dave’ Barry has already
announced his candidacy.

The whole problem could be
easily solved if the Democrats
simply changed their method of
nomination. My choice is the
system used in professional
baseball. It’s incredibly simple.
All the have to do is assign a Class
-A, —AA, Or —AAA rating to each
state. As politicians become more

popular, experienced, or
whatever, the Democratic
National Committee (consider it
a major league team - like the
Phillies) moves them up the
ladder until they’re ready to play

‘ball with the big boys.

NO nominations would be
needed this way. When you need
a presidential candidate, simply
look around at your Triple—A
states and try to find someone
with half a prayer to run for the
presidency.

it sounds a wee bit silly, I
realize, but it works in baseball.
If it’s good enough for our
national pastime, why not our
national elections?

One thing is for sure. The
Democrats can’t give up. If they
did, we’d only have to vote for
the Republicans and that would.
get boring after awhile. On the
plus side of this, though, is the
fact that there wouldn’t be and
campaign debates to pre-empt
“The SimpsOns.”

Maybe the Democrats could
arrange for some kind Of deal to
get Mikhail Gorbachev to change
his citizenship and run for Office.
True, he isn’t an American citizen.
He doesn’t even speak English
all that well (although that never
stopped Andrew Jackson). But

not even Ronald Reagan, at the
height of his presidency, had the
adoration of the American public
the way Gorbachev did. Elvis
may have once, but not Reagen.

The guy is so popular I'm sure
most people could overlook the
fact that he’s not a natural-born
citizen. Besides, look at it this
way: we would practically be
guaranteed verification on the
destruction of all those Soviet
nuclear weapons.

I’m sure Gorbachev, with the
way his cOuntry’s economy is
now, would be more than happy
to get rid Of his nuclear arsenal
anyway, before the Soviet people
use it On him. Aside from pulling
in foreign leaders, what can the
democrats do? Wait around until
the American people get bored
with voting for people with
nicknames like “The Gipper” and
“Skippy?”

That strategy hasn’t worked so
far. For crying out loud, it’s been
ten and a half years since a
Democrat has seen the inside Of

the Oval Office. The wallpaper -

probably isn’t even the same
anymore.

Right now, things look pretty

hopeless for the Democrats. But
you never know. After all, they’ve
been putting people like
Mondale and Dukakis up against
Reagan and Bush, only to get
crushed into the ground. Maybe
the Democrats have an ace up
their sleeve. Maybe it’s someone
like Geraldine Ferraro!
‘Well, maybe they don’t have
an ace up the sleeve.
in any case, this is about all the
deep political rambling I can

take for one election. As long as '

the next president doesn’t turn
out to be Mr. Ed, I don’t mind
much who takes the presidency,
Republican or Democrat.

Next year’s election doesn’t
bother me much, anyhoo. I’ve
already decided that I’m voting
for Dave Barry. We humorists
stick together, you know.

I wonder if Bo knows politics?

 Labels   make

 

racism easier

A When I came to Pitt I heard from a friend that there was
a lot,of “racial tension" on campus.
This same friend explained that they hung out in front

. of The ‘O’ on weekends, that they covered Forbes

Avenue and were boisterous and loud in the middle of
the night. ‘
‘ So? I hang out in front of The ‘O’ on occasion, and
under the right inﬂuence, I can be loud when I walk
down Forbes Ave.

This then, is racial tension: the very presence of blacks

Ross Pasquale

in Oakland. _
But wait — there’s more. My friend assured me that he

was not prejudiced himself.

“You see, “ he explained, “there are black people and
there are niggers." '

Oh, of course, I thought. How silly of me. What was I
thinking? I’ve been hearing this for years and rather than
becoming used to it, every time I hear it I become even
angrier. . '

Dividing blacks into two different classes, one good
and one not, allows bi gots to rationalize their discriminatory
behavior. It allows them to vent their prejudices on some
blacks while maintaining a friendly, politically correct
facade around others. A

Also, by placing labels on a large group of people, it
trivializes their very existence and makes it still easier for
whites to commit acts of violence and racism against
blacks. It must be easier to sleep with bashing a few
“nigge-rs" instead of “human beings.” .

On the same campus where multiculturalism and its

' sister term, cultural diversity, are used with the best of

intentions, there exists an entirely opposed school of
thought, one that would oppress people spiritually and
professionally because of their race. Remember, this is
the university that is having a difficult time retaining its
black faculty. .

So what, you ask? So now I’m add/dropping the class
that would have been taught by the highly recommended
black professor who decided the University of Pittsburgh
wasn’t the place to be. ,

I know the rights granted by the First Amendment
remain intact. Ialso know that I think it’s about time
citizens started looking at the N-word as being as
offensive as any/ other form of profanity.

The problem of racial prejudice is huge, but one of the
keys to solving it lies in changing the terminology that is
used by bigots, and not tolerating those who mask their

prejudice in the form of righteousness.

Continued from page B-1
In 1989, Pitt allowed the lease
' of The University Shop to expire
- and then refused to renew it.
When the University Shop closed
down after decades of customer
service, Pitt opened its own Pitt
paraphernalia store — The Pitt
Shop.
In addition to the former
travesty, Charles Bonasorte, the

street vendor who runs The Pitt
Stop, has been harassed by the
university several times in the
past few years. Bonasorte, whose
T-shirt and sweatshirt business
on the corner of Forbes Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard caught
the university’s eye, coincidentally
incurred several fines for violating
vending laws that apparently did
not apply to ﬂower vendors on

Forbes. The city has amended its _

laws, but probably not to the
satisfaction of Pitt — its biggest

employer.
The recent removal of Kinko’s
Copies from its location

underneath the Quad dormitories
only reinforces discontent among
tuition-paying students. When
Kinko’s finally moves out, maybe
Pitt will open its own copy shop
— in one of the most convenient
areas of Oakland —— putting more
money into the Pitt Panther
pocket.

Pitt also rules with an iron fist,
squeezing the last cent from
students when it comes to
textbooks. According to the Book
Center, the prices of new
textbooks are determined solely
by the publishers. The university
should try to justify its policy for
buying books back. The usual
end-of—the-semester policy. has

_the book center repurchasing

textbooks from students for an
outrageously low percentage of
the original book’s worth and
reselling at approximately two-
thirds of the publisher’s selling
price.

Students, of course, do not have
to resell their books, but it is

deplorable that Pitt uses the

situation to gain even more profit
from its students. A

It is not unreasonable that a
major university like Pitt should
try and build upon itself, but if it
chooses to purchase properties
and continually raise tuition, then
it should be developing the land
it owns before it scoops up more.

Property all over Oakland, from
Zulema Street to North Bellefield
Avenue to Meyran Avenue, is
owned by Pitt. Sure, it owns
parking lots, off—campus
apartment buildings, on-campus
housing and educational facilities,
but surprisingly enough, Pitt also
owns Howard Johnson's and a
few empty plots of land that
could be used for more
worthwhile purposes other than
growing foliage. ,

When the announcement of
ex-Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s
$3.3 million retirement package
became known to the incredulous
public, Posvar justified the perks
by stating that if he had been the
head of a corporation, his

 

settlement would have contained
more money and beneﬁts.
Posvar, however, was not the
president of a corporation. He
was the president of a university
— a ‘‘non—profit’’ university which
apparently struggles to survive as
the years continue. Tuition raises
are common in this neck ‘of the
woods, but their purpose should

be to pay for an education —— not -

for excess expenditures, such as
Posvar’s package and the
purchase of the Syria Mosque
property.

If these buyouts continue, Pitt
will soon own most of Oakland.
As a producer Pitt has often been
unfair to its consumers —— mainly
the students. A situation that finds
Pitt in economic control of
Oakland is frightening in terms of
the prices to which simple goods
and services will rise.

If there’s a buck in it, rest
assured Pitt will do it. According
to the name, Pitt is a university.
While you can’t always judge a
book by its cover, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to refer to
Pitt as an educational institution
and not a cutthroat corporation.

Politically Correct?  

I

THE PITT NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

:   Controversyover political correctness

On an early morning last spring an
intoxicated Brown University student was
staggering around his campus, aimlessly
yelling racist and homophobic epithets.
When another student confronted him,
Doug Hann called him a “faggot” an
raised his fists at him. -

After one student ﬁled charges against
Hann, he was convicted of violating three
provisions of the school’s disciplinary
code. The first provision was alcohol
related and the second concerned
“showing ﬂagrant disrespect for the well-
being of others.”

The third, and most controversial, was

 

Jen Calabrese

the provision prohibiting harassment by
“subjecting another person, group or class
of persons to inappropriate, abusive,

threatening or demeaning action based
on race, religion, gender, handicap,
ethhnicity, national ori-gin or sexual
orientation.” V

A committee voted to expel Hann and
the ruling was upheld by Brown president
Vartan Gregorian.

Many universities, including Pitt, prohibit
“hate speech” in their student conduct
code.

Critics charge that Hann’s first
amendment rights were violated because

he was punished for something he said. ‘

But the first amendment is not all-
encompassing.

mostly hype

Everyday restrictions are placed on what
people can say. People are allowed to
express themselves as they please, but
sometimes there are consequences.

Anyone can yell “Fire” in a crowded
public place or say something slanderous,
but that person has to deal with the
repercussions of their action.

Furthermore, Hann was not punished
solely because of something he said; it was
the threat of violence that accompanied
his slurs that got him expelled.

Additionally, this was not the first time
Hann had violated the code, previously he

Multiculturalism urzcl the politics of being politically correct

 

I know what you’re thinking.
You’re an incoming freshman, a
returning undergraduate student,
a graduate student, a professor,
or something else at the University
of Pittsburgh. You’re not
concerned with the new athletic
director or the new president or
the raise in tuition or the huge

. budget deficit at Pitt. No, no,

what you want to know is just
exactly what is this whole
“politically correct” thing or “P.C. "
thing, as it is often referred to in
this country where we are always
looking for abbreviations.

Well, here it is, so get out your

. scissors and frame this. The whole

politicallycorrect movement is a
lot 0’ hot air. Most people don’t

even know what politically correct
means, nor do they know what it
is to be P.C. Deﬁning P.C. is not
an easy thing todo, but here it
goes. The politically correct
movement is one by which
“progressive” individuals are
striving to make this world into
one where words offensive to
certain groups will never be
uttered. In conjunction with this
is the hope that if the words are
not spoken, then the thoughts
and opinions that normally
accompany them will also be
eliminated.

I do applaud any attempt to
create such a world, but at the
same time, I also realize that this
is unrealistic and impossible: That

 

David W.
Matta

does not mean, however, that I
think that it’s not worth the time
and effort, because I think it is.
But there is one catch. The
movement shouldn’t include the
requirement that everyone

change the way they refer to
people, groups of people, or
things, and anyone who refuses
to comply with the movement
shouldn’t be criticized or
ostracized. ‘

Now I’m not going to say that
the First Amendment protects
everyone’s right of free speech,
therefore allowing us all to say
whatever we want and refer to
people or things however we
want and, thus, not have to be
P.C. 1 do think thatAmerica should
have its collective mouth washed
out with a bar of soap; because
the country as a whole is too
accustomed to stereotypes and
negative epithets. However, as
long as no one is directly hurt or

offended by words, I do think
that the First Amendment protects
those rights (just as it protects the
rights of liberals to call George
Bush a fascist pig).

But in addition to wanting to
change the way we refer to
people and things, the P.C. would
like to see the course of a college
education changed so that a more
liberal approach is employed to
properly teach the budding minds
of undergraduate V students
everywhere. The movement that
accompanies the politically
correct movement hand in hand
on university campuses is called
multiculturalism. This movement
is intended to emphasize that

different cultures have unique and distinct
differences that should remain and be recognized
as differences that can all positively contribute
to the culture of the United States as a whole.
That is to say that minority groups can affect the
‘larger culture of this country just as they are
affected by the culture of this country.

This is a great idea in theory, but its practical
applications often prove to be more damaging
than not. By strongly encouraging and teaching
that cultural differences are great and that every
minority group should strive to maintain its
individuality, what frequently happens is that
the groups recede into themselves and do not
interact with the other groups around them.
Then the traditional American ideals of a melting
pot and “one nation, under God, indivisible”
are ruined.

The P.C. movement and the multicultural
movement have also begun to affect the
curriculum at institutions of higher learning.
Some leaders of the P.C. movement believe that
the work of courses, particularly history and
English literature courses, that do not encourage
and teach multiculturalism should be changed
and perhaps even updated so the cultural
differences of minority groups would be
presented in a positive light and not in the

negative light that they have been throughout
the course of time. One author who is often
mentioned as having been guilty of such atrocities
is Mark Twain.

To rewrite and/ or reteach history and change
great works of literature would be to destroy
American culture as we know it. There is room
for change in how some courses and some
material is taught. But if anyone asked me, I’d be
the first one to say that many college educations
need to be less liberal and more conservative,
and that is certainly not what multiculturalists
want to hear.

So, fellow members of the Pitt community, ‘if

you get an opportunity to pick something up .
about politically correctness (say, a copy of ‘

Newsweek or something at your dentist’s office
or the like), I would say to do it and read about
it. Become informed on the subject and then
make and express your own opinions. It does
make for very interesting and very intellectual
conversations. Actually, it might not hurt .to
apply the idea of becoming informed before
making and expressing opinions to all aspects of
our lives. Just food for thought. I knew that’s
what you were thinking.

Universities have a
responsibility to provide students
with a campus where they will
be free from harassment and

intimidation. Hate speech codes
are not an effort to stifle some
students, but rather a way to
make the campus an open place

' for everyone. The Brown incident

is at the heart of the current
controversy over “PC” or “political
correctness” on college campuses.
Speech codes are only part of the
PC debate.

Among the changes alarming
conservatives are classes that
focus on the work of women and

how history is portrayed. Some
students and professors have

From the reaction of the media
on the issue, you would think
that PC was tearing apart every



P»

. . A
campus in America. In the past A’ ~

year, newspapers and magazines
have been filled with “horror
stories” about PC.

A peek at the Aug. 7 issue of
The Chronicle of Higher
Education provides a clue as to
what is really going on. The
Chronicle ran two news briefs
detailing recent national

conferences held by conservative Q :\

college groups, The Young
America’s Foundation and the
Intercollegiate Studies Group.
Both conferences dealt with
combatting the wave of PC on
campus. At the Intercollegiate
Studies conference students were
taught a “tactical battle plan” for
“countering political correctness.”

The students were encouraged§.__

to try to get on committees that
were trying to diversify
curriculum in order top stop the
changes. At the Young America’s
conference students were told
not to call their campus groups
by their nationals chapter’s name,
but rather "to call them “free
speech organizations” in order
to elicit more support.

On the same page the Chron-
icle ran an article about study
that found despite all of the media

attention given to PC “few

institutions have experienced“

controversies over the content
of courses, speeches, or faculty
lectures.”

“Reports of widespread efforts
to impose politically correct
thinking on college students and
faculty appear to be overblown,”
said Elaine E1-Khawas, who
conducted the survey.

‘ . So why are conservative groups

mobilizing against a conﬂict that

The answer is simple. By giving” ‘

efforts to foster cultural diversity
a label — PC — conservatives

_ have a powerful weapon in

stopping the progress they ‘

disagree with. A few incidents
have been blown up into a
national problem. The result is
that conservatives are effectively
fighting against diversity and
equality under the guise of trying
to preserve our first amendment
rights.

B-13’

 

While athleticism is becoming a valued
trait in women, we still have a long way
to go.

The days when women had to pretend
to let men beat them in tennis are mostly
gone — but women’s collegiate athletics
still lack recognition.

Because women’s sports usually,don’t
draw the crowds and lucrative TV
contracts, athletes are oftenstalled after
college because there are few professional
leagues for women. Almost all attempts at

women’s leagues have failed because

promoters weren’t up to taking the
financial risks. The fans just weren't
interested.

But “sports” (roller derby, women’s
“professional” wrestling) that involve
women in subservient, degrading positions
are pulling in the bucks, while serious
women athletes are struggling for
audiences.

And just as women bodybuilders are
derided for being “too masculine,” women
in aesthetically pleasing sports often aren’t
seen as the athletes they are.

Pitt women’s gymnastics Coach Debbie
Yohman said her gymnasts are often
gﬁtnderestimated because they’re graceful

and “feminine.”
“Pound for pound, my kids are some of

Jenna" Ferrara I

the strongest athletes on campus. They
don’t spend four hours a day being cute.
They spend four hours a day working out
and sweating,” Yohman said. A

According to Carol Sprague, associate
director of athletics/varsity sports, Pitt is
“committed at this moment to having
women’s teams because it’s the right
thing to do —- not because there's a law.”

Title IX is a 1972 law which bans sexual
discrimination in educational programs
conducted at institutions that receive
financial aid.

It will take years before women have
their own traditions because they’ve only
had somewhat “equal” opportunities for
about the last 20 years.

The word “lady” as a superfluous
modiﬁer is symbolic of the unwarranted
second—class status of women’s sports.
It’s a subtle insult.

The names of most collegiate women’s
teams follow this formula: “Lady” + the
school’s mascot. Hence the Lady Eagles,
Lady Spartans — and Lady Panthers,
which isn’t as bad as the Pink Panthers of
the Albany College of Pharmacy. (The

Albany men’s team is the Panthers.)

“Like other unnecessary words, ‘lady’
has a diminishing effect when dragged
in,” according to The Handbook of
Nonsexist Wn'ting.- For Editors, Writers
and Speakers.

“I know a lot of places where people
feel it makes women sound kind of silly,”
assistant women’s volleyball coach Cindy
Braziel said.- “We’d rather just be the
Panthers.”

Yohman said, “I don’t call my kids the
Lady Panthers. I call them the women’s
gymnastics team  I don’t want to be
called the Pantherettes.”

Often college teams’ nicknames reﬂect
a perceived inadequacy of women as
compared to men: Mighty Oaks and Lady
Oaks, and the Bearcats and Bearkittens.
Or the Sugar Bears (I’m serious), the
female counterpart to the Bears of the
University of Central Arkansas.

“I’ve been places where the language
has just really been awful,” Yohman said.

Language shapes our reality— if young
women grow up hearing about
“policemen” and “ﬁremen,” they are subtly
being told that women do not do these
jobs.

The Blue Book of College Athletics lists
many schools with the same name for

 ~'~Recognitionfor women ’s teams still missing at Pitt

men’s and women’s teams, so “Lady”

obviously is not needed to differentiate. ,

Our language should not reflect any
difference in status between men’s and
women’s teams. ,

A While you don’t see reverse slam dunks
in women’s basketball, it’s still a sport in

its own right, incorporating finesse and

teamwork.

Pitt students need to know that women’s
sports can be exciting.

Pitt has a Top 20 women’s volleyball
team. “We went to Nebraska last year [for

- the NCAA tournament], and I saw some

great volleyball. It’s a very exciting sport
to watch,” said Vicki Veltri, program
coordinator/women’s sports at Pitt.

If people haven't attended women’s
sporting events, “they may not even know
if they like them,” Braziel said.

And as more Pitt students attend
women’s sporting events, the women’s
teams at Pitt will begin to get the
recognition and respect they deserve.

Read the sports schedules, and go see
what women’s sports at Pitt are all about.
And let’s get “Lady” taken off the team
names. We’re all Panthers.

never have to tell a cat to stop
following you.

As a token gesture, I’ll point
out that you can’t wrestle with a
cat. And you can’t train cats as
easily as you can a dog.

One point I will not give is that
dogs are more affectionate. The
truth is cats can be very
affectionate, but only when they
want to be. Dogs are affectionate

Lastly, some interesting
observations on differences in
between cats and dogs:When a
cat licks your face, it feels like
sandpaper; when a dog licks you,
it feels like an extremely wet
piece of meat. Cats can make you
feel stupid; dogs are usually just
stupid.

In any case, both cats and dogs

proved that the performance of
bisexual, lesbian and gay military
personnel was equal to or better
than that of their heterosexual
counterparts. (The report's

T" findings were originally

suppressed until they were
leaked to the press by an openly
gay member of Congress.)

The DOD also has failed to
prove its empty claims that
homosexuals are security risks
and will adversely affect morale.
(These same arguments, by the
way, were used by the military to
keep the armed forces segregated
racially.) Standing as
counterexamples to the DOD’s
paranoid and homophobic policy
are the armies of countries which

g—;' have integrated citizens of all

sexual orientations. Countries
such as Norway, Denmark, Italy,
West Germany, the Netherlands,
Israel, and Canada have fine and

“integrated armed forces. ,
' Second, American universities

should not be forced to
compromise their values because
of an irrational DOD policy. Major
universities, like Pitt, have strong
commitments to fostering
diversity and understanding
between different individuals,
groups, and cultures. It is
completely inconsistent with
these values to allow such a
glaring exception.

Third, heterosexual ROTC

policy. I am aware of cases at MIT and
Washington University, but these are rare.
If the goal of our detractors is really to
allow homosexuals to become officers
through Pitt’s ROTC, then why attempt to
abolish the program and force the Army to
get its officers through other means? Why
not change it, as the American Association
of Universities is attempting to do? Is this
issue really about allowing homosexuals
into ROTC, or is it about an attack on the
military in general, supported by the many
long—standing opponents of the military
presence on campus? The anti—military
demonstrators who have been on this

A campus since the ’60s have jumped on the

current bandwagon as a means to their old
end. But when I spoke to members of

BiGALA about this issue, it wasn’t an anti— ,

military movement, but really a patriotic
movement. It was about people who
wanted to be in the military, not people
who wanted it far away from, campus.
What increasing the rights of all to serve
their country has to do with attacking
ROTC’s existencel do not understand.

If ROTC is removed from campus, it is
the Army and the nation who will be hurt.

ROTC is an irreplaceable source of our
military leaders, 75 percentof whom
graduate from civilian universities. The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin
Powell, was himself an ROTC graduate.
The United States is the only major military
power that derives its officer corps from
liberal arts institutions. How better for the
military to mirror the values for which it
fights than to glean its leaders from a
university? ROTC represents not an
intervention of the military onto campus
but rather an injection of the campus into
the military. When the Army is led by
graduates of West Point and officer-
candidate schools, it will cease to represent
the nation it defends.

Pitt bears a responsibility to continue to
serve our'nation in this capacity. The
resources of our universities are a vital
element of our national power. If” our
administration objects to the military’s
policy, it should inﬂuence the DOD to
change but not sever the bond between the
university and the military. Pitt should join

with the other members of the American A

Association of Universities who are currently
lobbying the DOD to change its policy, an
effort which will likely meet with eventual

success. This course is not compromising
Pitt’s values but rather upholding our most
sacred ones, including the spirit of working
with and for our nation rather than against
it. When your country is misguided, ‘as it
often is, you attempt to change it; you don’t
abandon it. ‘
And that, in short, is why we deserve to
be here — because the university has a duty
to our nation; because the military will
become isolated without the university
and because the setbacks of the few, who

loudly raise voices for our removal, do not '

outweigh the needs of the many, the
nation. The university is obligated to do
not the politically correct thing but the-
right thing: to work for change in —— not the
destruction of —— our noble institutions.
Our nation was built by citizens and
scholars who were also soldiers, and we
need them today as much as ever. The
citizen-soldier is alive and well and studies
here at Pitt. Look around. They're the ones
who work harder and walk straighter than
most, and they're some of the finest people
I’ve ever known. I’d hate to see them leave.

THINGS TO DO IN THE CITY

FROM BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPORSTLIVWXY

By Brian Berger

and Ross Pasquale
The Pitt News \

For all you newcomers to southwestern PA’s city of three rivers,
these are the places to check out. For those Pitt students with and
without transportation, after the cafeteria wears off, and you need to
get happy after long nights of studying (like, who studies, right?), take
a walk around town. Some of the places are a bit of a trip, like maybe
a bus ride, but some are in your backyard. So here are the places to
hit in town, from A to Z.

rtery Small, smarmy and hopelessly hip, The Artery features live
music and pretentious atmosphere all under one roof. It’s on
Ellsworth in Shadyside and offers some neat altemative improvisational
theatre on certain nights.
eehive There’s the groovy one in Southside, which is a crowded
coffeehouse and an awesome place for cheesecake. It’s open 24
hours on weekends. Also opening soon is the Oakland version,
which will occupy the space on Forbes‘ Avenue once held by the
King’s Court movie theater. It looks like Pee-\X/ee’s Playhouse and is
probably a good place after a bad trip, if you know what I mean.
ollectors 12—inch Look up in the sky! Its a bird. It’s a  nope,
just another second—ﬂoor Oakland store window. Forget it. The
Collectors is the hype spot in town for the funky sounds — everything
from the new Downtown Science to the Ultramagnetics. If you can’t
figure out why you’re still doin’ the Pee—Wee Herman, it’s because
you been sleepin’ on the 12 inch. Located on Forbes, across from
Oasis, whose only licks are on the overpriced stickers. Pump up your
Jeeps, and they might make you a tape.
ecade Just a hop, skip and a jump from Forbes Avenue is the
home of rock ‘n’ roll. They regularly feature Blackﬁsh and other
bands. Eat, drink, be merry.
fide’s This is the place for those hard-to-ﬁnd CD5 and just plain
“out there” records, tapes and comic books. It’s Downtown, right past
the Strip District The service is a little bitchy, but that just adds to the
wicked edge the place has, and their alternative selection and pricing
can’t be beat. Just don’t make the mistake of forgetting to leave your
Polo shirt at the door, if you like your face.
abulous TroubadourA place downtown that features alternative
music and lifestyles. Overdone is the theme, but it’s worth a visit.
ullifty’s The home of some great desserts, and they’re open till
2. Their strawberry lemonade is also worth a shot. The atmosphere
is nothing short of clean art deco, and it’s on Murray Avenue in   _ , - ,

Dread Zeppelin is the most
unusual reggae band to date.
With the release of their second

. album, 5,000, 000' (which Could
be the weight of the band’s Elvis
look-alike singer, T ortelvis) the
band has proven itself a force to
be reckoned with. 5,000, 000‘ is
another collection of led Zeppelin
cover songs with four originals‘
thrown in along with a Bob Marley
song. This reporter caught up
with guitarist/keyboardistjah Paul
Jo on the phone in his hotel room
during the Dread Zeppelin tour
of Canada.

PI'IT NEWS: J ah, exactly who
is in charge of the band? Is it a
democracy? _

JAH PAUL JO: Well, you know,
Tortelvis is sort of the kingly
figure in our group, so it’s like a
monarchy. He’s revered by all. I
mean, just look at him. Are you
going to go against what he says?
He’s the man, and not only that,
but he ’,s getting psychic messages
from Elvis himself and kind of
instructs us on what our next
move should be. It was Elvis’
idea that we should come to
Canada. In fact, he came to
Tortelvis in some kind of dream-

vision and told him, ‘You’ve' got -

to go to Canada and do this
Zeppelin music reggae—style, the
way it’s supposed to be done.’
PN: Rumor has it that you
were going to shoot a movie.
Have you started that yet?

a little bit on the movie, and then
we go on the road again. And

PN: Where are you ﬁlming

JP]: A lot of it is done in Los =
Angeles, which is pretty much  ‘

all live at Graceland West, which
is an exact replica of the real
Graceland that Tortelvis had built
in Temple City, California. I guess
he chose Temple City because it
was named after his favorite
movie star, Shirley Temple.

PN: His favorite movie star
isn’t Elvis?

JP]: Well, Elvis is his favorite
movie star, but Shirley Temple is
like a special thing. It’s like a lot

THE PI'I'I' NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

 

‘lronjohn’ examines ’90s men

Byjenna Ferrara
News Editor

How to be a man: the problem
of the ’90s. Old macho stereotypes
aren’t working; the new “sensitive”
ones aren’t working either, so
here’s Robert Bly to show you
how to achieve a higher plane of
masculine spirituality through
mythology‘ and metaphor’ — in
eight difficult steps.

Bly’s men’s movement is
orchestrated around a return to
ancient mythology, and his book,
Iron john: A Boole About Men, is

‘so cloaked in fairy tales and

symbolism as to be often
unintelligible —— and not

applicable to a convoluted world. ,
Bly seeks to restore men’s
strength — but not their brutality

—through a return to myths with
stron g male characters. He writes
of “Zeus energy, positive
leadership energy in men,” of
the “Wild Man” who is not savage
or destructive and who is
respectful of nature.

In Iron jolm he displays an
impressive arsenal of poetry,
mythology and psychology —
among these his own poems and
translations — and he records
his conversations with many
people who are in pain.

But although a return to myth
can be fascinating to the
ungrounded modern human, it’s
not going to be able to solve
complex problems that people
thousands of years ago could
never have dreamed of. The
“good old days” just aren’t the

answer.
At age 64, Bly is recovering
from his dysfunctional

relationship with his alcoholic
father, and he’s recognizing that
men need strong male role models
just as women need to look up to
other women. The absence or
oiuelty of fathers in American
society is the root of men’s (and
some -women’s) problems,
according to Bly. .

Men’s problems began t
worsen after the Industrial
Revolution, when working with
one’s hands became to be seen
as uncivilized, according to Bly.
Men lost touch with the earth and
didn’t have much to show their
children but a tedious job selling
insurance. ‘

Young men weren’t able to
actually see what their fathers did
all day, and most of the fathers
got frustrating office jobs and
came home in the evening,
irritable and distant. Bly refers to
Alexander Mitscherlich, a German
psychologist who writes that the
child of an inaccessible father
will be plagued with “demons
who tell him  the father is evil.”

He ties the emptiness which
often envelops modern men
partly to remote or cruel fathers,
to a missing link with older males
who should show younger ones
the road to masculinity.

Bly differentiates between the
“soft male,” a child of ’60s
liberalism or New Age
philosophy, and the “Wild Man,”
a vital creature who lives,
(however hidden) in all men.

The “soft male’’ is that
maddeningly frustrating man
(epitomized by the acronym
SNAG, “sensitive new-age guy”)
who cares about animal rights,
the environment — and he’s not
going to insist his girlfriend can’t
spend an evening with her friends
—— but he lacks energy,
decisiveness and fire. Bly sums it

 
   

Jason Billings/The Pitt News
up: “He’s not happy.”

Bly’s observations on male
emptiness are intertwined with
passages from “Ironjohn,” a 19th-
century Brothers‘Grimm folk tale.
Iron John, a very hairy “Wild

Man,”has been locked in a cage .

by the king. The king's son frees

Iron John, who teaches the boy

how to be a man.

Along his carefully written road
to male consciousness Bly lapses
into the ridiculously metaphorical:
“Singles’ bars, then, are fantastic
alchemical ovens where attempts
to fuse crude metals go on day
after day, night after night.” Are
they? It becomes hard to wade

‘through the bizarre symbolism
and into a coherent understanding
of what he means.

While Bly wisely does not
blame women for the lack of
accessible male role models, he
constantly suggests that women
"are unable to supply the res‘olve
that young males need to grow”
into men.

“One woman declared that she
realized /about the time her son

’ got to high school that he needed
more hardness than she could

A naturally give. But, she said, if

-she made herself harder to meet
that need, she would lose touch
with her own femininity.” I Us the
traditional concept of “so_ft”
femininity which is at fault here,
not the woman. So it’s better to
have a had father than no father?
It is insinuated that qualities
desirable for.men and women
are markedly different; he talks
about possessive, overprotective
mothers as if these women are
behaving (correctly) in accord
with their gender. He seems to
respect women, but not mothers.
One way for young men to
begin to confront the “Wild Man”
is to spend more time with their
fathers_, breaking with their
mothers in the rituals of young
men in tribal cultures, Bly asserts.
But he’s disregarding the
problematic American family.

.What works in cohesive cultures

Underground the word for fall's coming comics

By Mike Sula
For The Pitt News

Ever open up a multi-colored
newspaper and read something
by some colorless yuppie
journalist about how the Comics
aren’t just for kids any more? Or
something about their “relative
accessibility" to just about any
old schlep with a passing interest
in anything from lymphatic cancer
to Gloria Estefan’s neck brace?

Chances are that “relative
accessibility" means strolling into
your local comics hole/hobby
shop/convenience structure and
ending up gazing glassy—eyed at
row after row of DC/Marvel-

, brand pulp extolling the virtues

and adventures of any
combination of testo-bulge super-
schmucks or armed government
cheese deliverers. Look harder
because there probably is a lil’

’ corner in that establishment

where you might ﬁnd titles more
interesting, strange and original
to a reformed Justice League fan
club member. As the cover of
Peter Bagge’s Hate warns:
“Sophisticated cretins preferred.”

The summer of ’91 started off
promising a veritable cornucopia
of underground comic dementia
as old faves surprised us with
new issues, and a few debuts
popped out of the sordid
underbelly of art—school rejects,
and then for two months 
nothing. We were forced to sit
idly under our fans, thumbing
back issues of Cheech Wizard.
Some even admitted feeling sorry
for Robert Crumb  again.
Anyway, word has it that the fall
heralds the return of an orgy of
underground comics, magnifying

the perverse, angst-ridden,

satirical dramas that mirror our

pathetic, miserable existences.
Unbeknownst to many fans of

the David Lynch School of __Fear‘

and Laughter, there exists a comic
artist who makes the filmmaker
look like Marlin Perkins. Six issues
of Daniel Clowes’ Eightball have

already twisted the imaginations ‘‘
~ and haunted the dreams of every

dissatisﬁed paranoiac who has
ever daydreamed of dogs with no
bodily oriﬁces or the possibilities
of a worldwide feminist revolt.
Each issue moans with the
nightmares of the damned as
Clowes leads his readers down
the twisted landscape of an
America slowly crumbling under
the weight of fear and the
unknown. To the relief of long-
suffering fans who rely on
Eightball as a guide through a
world overﬂowing with insanity,
issue number seven is due by the
end of August.

Along with "Clowes, the other
prophet of middle—American
doom is Peter Bagge, creator of

the brilliant Neat Stuff and now
Hate. Anyone who has ever been
young and either too smart or too
bitter (or both) to get a real job
will identify with the hero of
Hate, the terminally cynical
Buddy Bradley. Issue number four
featured a cross-country visit from
Buddy’s jarhead little brother who
alienates Buddy’s friends by
standing guard over the keg at a
party and making them recite the
Pledge of Allegiance before
allowing them beer. Expect issue
six this fall.

Blabis an infrequently released
comics anthology with stories by
various up ‘n’ comers and usually
focusing on a particular theme.
Last time it was the all-psycho
issue. The new one, due out this
fall, will be the all-alcoholism
issue and will feature stories by
Clowes, exploding artist Joe
Coleman and Richard Sala, who
recently had an animation short
on MTV’s Liquid Television.

Whispers of future releases this
fall by other notables give further
hope for the “relative

accessability" for those of us with
a more refined sense of laughter
in the bathroom. Issue number
two of Mary Fleener’s Slutburger
Stories " is out now and comes
highly recommended by Phantom
of the Attic’s comics gargoyle and
travelin’ man, Dan Allen. Says
Dan: “Mary Fleener is the most

underrated cartoonistever. Ifjoe '

Matt was interesting, he’dbeMary
Fleener.”

I Also due soon is issue number
five of the world’s most
misanthropic stick figure,
Stickboy, featuring guest artist
Wayno, creator of BeerNutz and
cover artist for the new Karl
Hendricks seven-inch. Wayno’s
accompanying piece is a parody
of the deserving Stickboy called
“Schtickboy.”

Speakin’ of Wayno, Beer Nutz
No. 2 is due soon, as well as Julie

Doucet’s DirtyPlotteNo. 4. Finally,
Fantagraphics, publishers of many
of these fine artists, is expected to

release a merchandising line

which includes, among other

things, Eightballcoffee mugs (just '

in case you need to advertise
your literary preferences). '

Although this summer did see
comic brilliance in a few things,
like Musgrove and Sendelbach’s
Loose Teeth, featuring the trials of
the dog who was ate the world,
Fat Dog Mendoza, this fall
promises unalloyed joy for the
purveyors of intelligent sickness
in their comics.

Fresh ﬂesh? Newvin town? You

can ﬁnd all of these comics and p’
more at Phantom of the Attic on '

Phantom of the Attic Comic
lovers have dubbed this their

recently remodeled movie theater

Pitt News File Photo

By Rob Penman
For The Pitt ‘News

On a good day, several trillion
dollars (all dollars — yen, marks,
whatever have you -— that need
to be transferred from one bank
to another anywhere throughout
the world) must first flow through
New York. Enter the Bank of
Credit and Commerce
International. They have been
skimmin’ the crazy jack. .We’re
talkin’ 12 digits— and laundering
it. Now take a guess who also has

links to BCCI: Abu Nidal, The

Mujhadeen, Manuel Noriega and '

even Jimmy Carter. Imagine
there's no country, but believe

there's some screwed—up
nationalism — plenty to pass
around.

Or how’s ‘bout this: a wacked-
out acting troop/sex cult with
visionsof resettlement on the

planet Mars is in charge of the  ,

largest environmental research
project ever ‘designed. Along for
the ride on this one are Yale
University‘ and the same ad
agency that markets Disneyland.
Sometimes it can really be the
theater of the absurd.

By now, cynicism is firmly

I gelled within your person, but

there's hope. The prescription:
First, turn off Nigbtlme, or put
down your copy of The New York

Times or whatever you’re doing, _
_ and call ‘PTS or ‘RCT and request

something by the Watershed.
Also, a bellyful of pierogies along

with a couple sets by the band at

the Bloomﬁeld Bridge Tavern fills
the perscription for spiritual
cleansing; your spirits will be
lifted in seconds.

OK, so I haven't said jack about
the band. Here’s the spiel: By
virtue of their sound, they avoid
any “ghetto—ized” pigeon hole. In
a broad sense, it’s pop music.
One could also draw similarities
to the Elliot Sharp experimental
quirk of the Knitting'Factory or
the skull—wrenching Downtown
scene of Borbetomagus and
Machine Gun.

“There are times when there
are melodies, and we don't go in

Showcase Editor

Finding a video that you would

want to watch on weekends can
be a challenge, but I’ve decided
to lend a hand and clue you in on
some neat films. I originally
wanted this to be a list of cult
videos, but it grew a bit out of
hand, and I think I can safely say
that any of these ﬁlms will hold
your attention for more than one
viewing. None of them are hits;
some are sleepers, some are cult
films, and some just haven't been
seen in a while. Enough

introduction — here are my

recommendations for a taste of
not—necessarily-popular video
rentals:

Blue Velvet David Lynch may
have pissed a lot of people off
with his convoluted cult series,
“Twin Peaks,” but this rich and
wicked film about the underworld
of a small town should not be

 

 

punished for it. It’s all about the
angelic Laura Dern and her crush
on Kyle MacLachlan’s outsider,
who discovers a disembodied
ear and decides to investigate it.
The porcelain-like Isabella
Rosselini is strangely gritty here,
and Dennis Hopper revived his
career as the sadomasochist,
Frank. This film confronts us with
sex, violence and drugs in such
an intimate way that it is haunting
for some time. Angelo
Badalamenti’s score pounds the
eardrums as the characters
descend into their basest fears
and desires. The texture is not to
be missed.

Heathers Cruelty is the name of
the game in this dark comedy
that follows the adventures of an
/all-powerful female clique at an
Ohio magnet high school. Like
no teen movie before or since,
Heathers’ raunchy humor is
quoted far and wide. Suicides set

their point across without being
overly blatant about it. It's the
new “thesaurus” style coming to
get ya. The “Pimp” Minister’s style
is nicer on the mike because of
his ability to ﬂuctuate styles, while
Serch raps in a more deﬁant
manner. There are acouple of
throwaways on the record
(“Herbalz In Your Mouth” and
“Al’z A-b—cee’z"), but the rest are
dope. “Ace in the hole” picks up
the pieces of “Gasface” with
members of KMD ﬂaunting their
microphone techniques, while
“Kick ‘em in . the Grill” gets
downright freaky when the big
man, Chubb Rock, joins in.

The record has its serious
moments about racism and
problems of ghetto life (“No
Master Race, No Master Plan” and
“Problem Child”) but is, overall,
another hilarious effort. Interludes
like “Sea Vessel Soliloquy” take
hysterical potshots at rap music

cuts, while at other times letting
loose with power beats mixed
with intelligent sampling. One
of the major moves on this record
is the scratching of DJ Richie
Rich. 3rd Bass knows how to
rock, and it knows that the staple
of rock is great guitar leads. The
Threes realize that rap and rock
do mix, and they let the turntable
talents of Daddy Rich loose,
supplementing his scratching like
a rock band would a guitar lead.
Rich gets really nasty on “Come
In,” as he scratches a sample
from Eric B. & Rakim, one of the
finest slices ever. The record is
actually a showcase for Richie
Rich’s talent, and the microphone
men don’t mind, letting their DJ
go off on extended scratch ‘n
sniff cuts. '

Prime Minister Pete Nice and
M.C. Serch are from the same

dissin’ the rapper of the month.
Last time it was M.C. Hammer, or
M.C. household tool; this time it’s
Vanilla Ice on “Pop Goes the
Weasel,” which contains one of
the baddest drum tracks of the
summer as well as some great
sampling of Peter Gabriel and
The Who. “Microphone
Techniques” slams as Nice And
Smooth join in the rap fest, but
“No Static At All" is the jam,
featuring samples of “I’m A Man”
and something way groovy from
the ’60s surf sounds. And, of
course, DJ Richie Rich slices and
dices like a ginsu. Kick it, Pete: “I

Leaders Of The New School
A Future Without A Past
Elektra Records

On the Leaders Of The New
School's debut record, A Future
W/ttboutA Past, MC Charlie Brown
kicks it: “Elektra selects a new
breed to lead them/into the ’90s
with success and then/make
everyone look bleary/ for now

they know Pinocchio’s theory.”

Theory, fairy tale or fable, the
crew at Elektra Records has got it
in motion. First it scored with the
funky debut of the Brand
Nubians, then they kicked the
righteous KMD and lined up two

. solid singles from C.L. Smooth

and Pete Rock (don’t sleep on it;
the full-lengther’s due in a month
or so) and Del Tha Funkee
Homosapien (with the lethal Ice
Cube in the production corner
along with DJ. Pooh). But Elektra
smokes fat blunts with the
Leaders’ (LONS) first try.
LONS—MC Brown, the monsta
Busta Rhymes and Dinco D.,
along with cut monitor Milo --
come off like revved—up Indy

NW/A’s latest effort

NWA
Niggazﬂgfe
Priority Records

What more can be said about
these “foul-mouthed” four? We
all know that they are sorely
lacking in political correctness.
Especially Eazy—E, with his
schmoozing President Bush and
his mob, and Dr. Dre, with his
assault on a video show hostess
(Dee Barnes of “Pump it Up”)
and the resulting lawsuit and
arrestwarrant. But anyway, with
Nz'ggaz4Life, NWA seems to be
on the same path to self-
destruction that the Sex Pistols
followed.

Niggaz4Lzfe is essentially one
hour of gang—banging, woman-
baiting, killing and typical male
braggadocio. But do those things
make it listenable? Well, yes and
no. While Dre and Yella get
special mention for coming up
with some funky songs, the lyrics

NWA, Ice Cube, left, there were
rumors that these guys would
become wack. An EP and the
current album proved that these
guys were halfway between
inspired and lackadaisical. Eazy,
on the one hand, should forget
singingaltogether(“Automobile,”
the first—ever “ghetto/country”
song and the P-Funk sounding
and honestly blunt “I’d Rather
Fuck You”). Dre, on the other
hand, should get involved with
NOW (“One Less Bitch”).
There’s an old saying that there
is a sucker born every minute,
and the guess is that the “niggaz
in black" pulled a new world
record for convincing almost one
million record fans to buy their
new release and subsequently
topple dance diva Paula Abdul’s
new release off the top of the
album charts. The guess here is
that beneath all that bluster, the
“niggaz in black” really don’t have
anything to say, and we got left
holding the bag. '
—D.M. Summers

Hueylewis,
News ‘Hard
atePlay’.

Hard at Play
EMI

Have you heard the News? I “"7"-—

mean, have you heard them lately?
After 1988’s abominable Small
World, you might have thought
Huey Lewis and the News had
gone soft, but Hard at Play, their
sixth and most recent album,
proves the heart of rock and roll
is still beating. '
Sure, they’re getting old. One

I look at Play’s cover will show just

how much pop stardom has

affected Huey, now 40. The blue— 7\

collar frustration in the band’s '

music has crept its way onto his
face. When, in the middle of
Play’s ﬁrst single, “Couple Days
Off,” Huey pleads, “Let me catch
my breath,” you wonder whether
or not that line is really part of the
song.

It is. Huey hasn’t lost any
energy; he just has to work harder
to get to it. Hence the title.

Still, it is hard to tell by listening.

“Build Me Up,” Play’s opening;

track is arguably the best driving
rock of the band’s career. Listen
to that harmonica!

“It Hit Me Like A'Hammer” is
another in the long line of the
News’ patented slow-but-not-
really songs. That’s their bread
and butter, and “Hammer” is up
to par. For some reason, it kept
reminding me of Queen’s “You’re
My Best Friend.”

Mario Cipollina’s bass line gives
“Attitude” plenty of the same.
Johnny Colla provides fab sax
sounds, but the best noise comes
from Huey himself. I haven’t heard

, him scream like this since “You

Crack Me Up” from 1983's mega-
album Sports, and everybody
knows screaming is a big part of
what makes rock and roll rock.

THE Pl'I'l‘ NEWS ORIENTAION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

- ‘?~ 

 

“He 'Don’t Know" has a corny
spoken intro, but it gets better,
thanks largely to the melodic
falsetto blends of the News. It’s a
shame they only croon on the
slower ones, anymore. No

wonder Huey sounds so
overworked. Hard-rocking
harmonies are a lesson Huey
could learn from Queen.
“Couple Days Off” is the band’s

. first legitimate jam. This blue— ‘

collar anthem screams crowd

I .» pleaser and is sure to be a concert

staple. Chanted refrains are an
old trick for live acts, but this cry
will inspire the kind of enthusiasm

   

Huey  and the News,

not heard in arenas since (boom

boom) “Out Go The Lights!” The-

rocker rhythm is also a formula,
but at least they got creative with
the breathing effects. It's nice to
hear them used for something
other than simulation of the sex
act. (Take any BBD release.)

I thought for a moment “’Ihat’s
Not Me” would give Sean Hopper
a chance to do his thing on
keyboards — a treat we haven’t
really heard since “I Never Walk
Alone” from Fore! (1986). The
News has cut downon keyboards,
following what seems to be an

industry—wide trend. At least they

    
   

sing along with this one. Granted,
it’s no “Naturally,” but what is?

“We Should Be Making Love,”
another almost-ballad, just
doesn't compare to earlier
successes. This one should have
been done as a straight ballad.
They can do it, after all. In fact,
“World to Me” was Small World ’s
only saving grace.

Despite the deadpan fun of the
title, “Do You Love Me, Or What”
bites. Hey, there’s going to be
one loser on every album. (OK,
except Sports.) _

“Best of Me” isn’t what it claims
to be, but it does bring back fond
memories of Fore! It’s_a happy
song, and that alone earns it
brownie points.

“Don’t Look Back, ” easily Play’s ,

catchiest tune, is my favorite.

-Coincidentally, it has strong

keyboards, and the News
harmonizes- Bill Gibson’s drums
keep it peppy but light— a marked
contrast to his knock—off—your-
socks work on “Couple Days

Off.”

That's what I like best about
the News; they’re so tight! There
are no obnoxious, overpowering
solos or grandstanding. It’s either
give and take or a blend. This
kind of harmony comes from
working with the same guys for
11 years. -

Before launching his current
tour, Huey told Billboard
magazine, “The fun part is, I
don’t have to answer claims that
it’s some sort of calculation to get
back on the radio because there’s

nothing like it on the radio."
Maybe so, but I think the fun
part is that I can start watching

MTV again. Huey always has had ‘

the funniest videos.

Incidentally, did anybody else
catch his Disney debut? “Once
Upon A Time In New York City”
from the Oliver and Company
soundtrack was so good, it might
even have salvaged Small World.
Disney owns the rights, however,
so this one’ll have to remain in
the archives.

going to work in fragmented
America.

What about divorced mothers
raising their sons alone because
the boys’ fathers have openly
rejected their children? What does
a woman do?

“I mentioned the classic
solution in many traditional
cultures, which is to send the boy
to his father when heis 12.” The
implications of sending yourig
boys to fathers who have
abandoned them is preposterous.

But Bly scrambles . to justify
himself.

“Many men, however — and I
am one, of them — have found

‘ inside an ability to nurture that

didn't appear until it was called
for.” (In other words, just hope
that your ‘ex-husband discovers
his “ability to nurture” when you

unexpectedly drop his 12-year-
old son on his doorstep.)

Bly is also fond of making
statements such as, “But showing
a sword doesn’t necessarily mean
ﬁghting. ' It can also suggest a
joyful decisiveness,” and then
moving swiftly on to another
paragraph. Here he’s trying to
show that men need to be able to
lift the sword, if not use it. But it’s
an unﬁnished idea — and why
the sword as a symbol of this
enlightened male power?

Robert Bly is right. American
men are at a point of crisis, and it
hurts everyone that men are often
inaccessible and frustrated. But a
return to ancient myths and the
stereotypes which B1y’s entangled
in aren’t going to solve anyone’s
problems.

By Nancy Marple
For The Pitt News

Most of us turn to the back
pages of In Pittsbmgb or, for more
kinky fun, the Village Voice, to
read the personals for a laugh. In
her newest whodunit, Loves
Music, Loves to Dance, Mary
Higgins Clark brings out the most
dangerous as-pect of the
personals: a date which leads to
death. _

‘Erin, a jewelry designer, and
her best friend, Darcy, an interior
decorator, are enlisted by their
friend, Nona, to gather
information about dates they pick
up from contrived personals
responses, to be used on 'a
television expose a la 60
Minutes. When Erin does not
return from her date with an
elusive partner who calls himself
Charles North, Darcy decides to
assist in the‘ police investigation
for the killer by continuing to go
out with personals partners.

Our illustrious heroine ignores
the advice of the many friends
who would stop her from further
dating and enters the terrible

world of the psychopathic killer.
Or, in a better version of this
story, she might.

Unfortunately, Clark’s
1

characters are stereotypical and
cardboard. Not only is the
heroine’s spunky attitude
underdeveloped, but the killer
hir_ns_elf poses no threat to the
reader’s peace of mind. The
heroes and good guys have all
seen better times in better novels.

The plot is predictable in the
extreme, so there is no point in
reading this superﬁcial effort for
plot. There is not one bone-
chilling scene with the killer, no
true drama in the police search

THE PIT!‘ NEWS ORIENTAION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

By Monica Novak
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Thirty—year—old Bruce Roth graduated from Pitt's law

school a few months ago, but he never thought he’d be a

lawyer.

Ten years ago, he had his mind on another goal — to
become a famous acoustic guitarist. So at the idealistic
age of 19 he dropped out of Franklin and Marshall
College, where he was a first—year student, and packed

“I decided to give up after
seeing that people who I felt
were better than me Weren't
going anywhere."
    $ruce Roth

up and headed ,0 New York, hoping to live out every  

young, ambitious musician’s dream — to make it in the
Big Apple. A
Roth, whose preference and talent lies in country
blues, got his first break shortly after his arrival. Roth
said, “I went to New York at the tail end of the Greenwich
Village folk—music scene. After I arrived, I went to a club
called Folk City to hang out. Sitting at a table in the back
were Roy Bookbinder, Dave Von Ronk and George
Thorogood. I was too young and naive at the time to be
intimidated by them, so I just sat down and startedeto
chat.” - .
His chatting paid off, and his small talk landed him a
big opportunity — to study with Von Ronk, “the Eric
Clapton of acoustic guitar,” as Roth referred to him.
Struggling to support his lessons with the master, Roth
remembers working 50 hours a week in a grocery store
and having to put up with his roommate, an eccentric I
actor who was a soap—opera extra.

 

After a summer of waiting in lines with people like
Suzanne Vega just to have the chance to perform on an
open stage, Rothdecided to give up on his dream.

“I decided to give up after :seeing that people who I felt
were better than me weren't going anywhere,” Roth says.

So Roth became a philosophy major at the University
of Pennsylvania. He still didn’t have any career ideas, so
he decided to try law school because it was the “path of
least resistance.” .

He said, “I just ran out of things to -do, and law school
seemed like a good idea.”

Now that all the “exploring is out of his system,” Roth
seems to have found some direction. After graduation,
Roth will be what he considers a “small—town,general—
practice lawyer” and will return to his hometown to work

as a clerk at the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas.

But just when he thought it was safe to make a career
commitment, Roth was given the opportunity to play at

The Decade, opening up for The Pep Boys, an R&B band
from Pittsburgh.

“The idea of playing out just fell into mylap.‘ Brook
Duer, an old friend of mine from law school who was a
former bass player for the Pep Boys, put me in contact
with the band," he said. 1 ‘

He then received a call from NextBig Thing Productions
and was asked to open for Billy Price at Graffiti.

“There seerr1s to be a newfound popularity in blues and

" and folk music. It seems to be coming in fashion again,”

he said.

Roth explained the different styles of blues:

“Blues are the roots of American music. They are part
of the Afro—American culture originating in the cotton ‘
fields as religious chants. Blues were primitive around

the turn of the century, becoming more sophisticated as ~

time went on. The Mississippi Delta was the most prolific
breeding ground for blues. Eventually, styles cropped up
‘in Texas and the Carolinas. Texas blues incorporate more
strumming, while Delta blues have more single—note
basslines. The Carolina blues have an alternating bass ,
style with right-thumb ﬁngerpicking." A

The resurgence in popularity of the blues has taken
Roth by surprise. But this time, it doesn't seem as though
Roth is going to drop everything in pursuit of a/musical

career as he did almost a decade ago.

“The music business'is a tough business. You have to .

really want it. I know what it means to pay your dues,”
he said.

cheeseburgers where he’s dipping
them in batter, and he’s deep-
frying them. He lets it cool for an
hour, then he fries it a second
time, whichis where he claims
that the taste really comes in. And
then he covers that in a preserve
of some kind, like jam or jelly,
and he’s calling it a Tortelvis
Burger Monte Cristo. It’s a very
tasty confection. Now, I had one,
but I tell all the readers, ‘Don't,

Elvis that night.

PN: Has Tortelvis ever been
reported at a Burger King in
The Enquirer?

JP]: You know, I don’t know.
I'm sure that people do get exited
when they see him and especially
the older women because they
still got this thing for Elvis and
they just can’t get rid of it. So
when they see Tortelvis, they
actually think that he is him
sometimes. I know that in Japan
I’ think the people thought he
really was Elvis.

We’ve been through Canada, the

Interiors, Septemberand Another
Woman are experiments in his
juggernaut of making a great
drama. Allen freely admits their
shortcomings. In fact he is all too
quick to criticize his work.

Lax also addresses the
complaints that actors have had

. while working with Allen, the ,
biggest being his handling of his

actors. Lax writes that Allen is not
a barbarian on the set, nor does
he publicly chastise his actors if
things do not work out.

The one complaint levied
against Allen is his trouble
communicating to the actors the
exact scene andmannerism he
has in mind for their character.
The author includes comments
by Sam Shepard (originally cast
in Interiors) but replaced, about
Allen being “piss—poor” as an
actor's director.

In addition to professional
information about Woody, Lax
investigates the women in
Woody's life, as well as some of
the myths about the man. For
instance, Allen is not an unathletic
person. In fact, he is quite

proﬁcient at a number of sports, .

baseball being his favorite. The
only child he has fathered is
named Satchel after the pitcher.
Lax does not dwell on one
aspect of Allen too long, and by
constantly poking different facets
of the ﬁlmmaker’s life, he presents
an impressive x—ray of one of
cinema’s most gifted entertainers.

‘gin In‘a comparison- of songs between the two bands, Baton Rouge’s

  681-HAIR  

Baton Rouge lou sy excuse for metal band   ,

By Aric Buckholt
Staﬁ Writer

Well, it finally happened. I found a metal band thatI can say I don’t
like. It’s not that the band is musically bad, but what they have done
really pisses me off.

First, the set-up. Two guitarists, a bass player, a drummer and a
vocalist. Sounds alright, doesn’t it? But when I turned on the music,
I thought I was listening to Y&T. Not since Kingdom Come’s first
album have I heard a band try to blatantly be another band. Baton
Rouge shows absolutely no originality in their lyrical style, guitar style
or vocal.style. .

Musically, the only way they differentiate from Y&T is in the fact
that you cannot hear the bass at all. As a matter of fact, I even went
so far as to ﬁnd out if the band members were the same. The names
were not the same, but I still think that Kelly Keeling of Baton Rouge
is really Dave Meniketti under an assumed name.

“Tie You Up” reminds me of Y&T’s “Lipstick and Leather,” and BR’s
“Desperate” is reminiscent of Y&T’s “This Time."

The one time that they tried to be different is with an instrumental
piece, “The Midge II.” The song is an absolutely worthless piece of
musical trash. ,

The band and the album have absolutely no saving grace. For
originality, they get “-5” on a scale of 1 to 10, but they get a “S” on
a 1—to—10 for their copying ability, which gives them an overall score
of ZERO for the album. If you want to support their rip-off lifestyle,

 then buy the album, but if you want to hear Y&T, do yourself a favor
and buy Y&T_ Baton Rouge scores low points on the Buckholt-o-meter.

Ringers David
Cronenberg’s masterful portrait
of twin gynecologists ranks among
the best of this type of dual-role
ﬁlm. Jeremy Irons is completely
indistinguishable as the brothers
who share everything— including

— ' ibizarre sexual practices and the

same woman, played by the aging
sex kitten, Genevieve Bujold. The

reminds one of the decaying

modern version of The Fly. .

The Manchurian Candidate
John Frankenheimer’s 1963
political thriller chronicles the
brainwashing of a soldier in
Korea, played by Laurence
Harvey, and the subsequent hell
that his life becomes. Angela
Lansbury is incredible as his dirty-
minded, politically ambitious
mother, who’s calling all the shots.
Their Oedipal relationship is
deeply strange. The black and
white photography adds tension,
Bernard Hermann’s score is
wonderful, and Frank Sinatra is
just great. The shocking ending
caused it to be pulled around the
time of JFK’s assassination.

there and deconstruct, which is
maybe not the hip thing to do.
We go a lot on intuition, whereas
New York bands have processes
of deconstruction,” said Steve
Hineman, the drummer for
Watershed.

Along with Hineman, dem
other guys have lineages to many
other bands around town:
Morphic Resonance, The Feral
Family, ATS, Active Ingredient
and even the late, great, monster-
truck ornnivores, The Heretics.

Here's - the lineup for
Watershed: Steve Hineman,
drums (He piddles around with
saxophone.); Daryl Fleming,
‘electric guitar; Erin Snyder, cello;
Ben Opie, saxophone, clarinets
and Jeff Stringer, bass (which he
claims is an extension of his
member).

Asked if they were going to
add any unorthodox
instrumentation, like Liof

:”.‘7Mulimuula (kettle drums,

marrimbas, etc.), Opie
responded, “I’m interested in that,
but it's too hard to set -up in a
club. I'd rather concentrate on
the basics. [The Watershed has]
got such a full sound, and I'm not
concerned about gaps.”

Based on the idea of a
workshop, the Watershed hopes
its existence can be a vehicle for
challenging the abilities of each
member, “an opportunity to sit
down and compose, -and work
on our abilities and play it

intentionally doing things that
play on each others’ weaknesses,”
Opie said. “Nobody says, ‘no,’
except when Darrel wants to play
‘You Light Up My Life’ or Abba,"
Opie said. Seeing them live throws
that idea into motion. It’s quite
refreshing compared to the set-
list hackings of many a band.
Each set is a different fingerprint.
Looking into the immediate
future, the band will be releasing
a three—song seven-inch sometime
this September. Also in the works
is a full—length record or compact
disc when the scratch is available.
Some members of the band are
classically trained; others, aren't,
but the band sees that distinction
as irrelevant. Within or without
of the realm of academia, each
member of the band agrees that
the most important thing when
interested is to go out and find
the music yourself. The
operational idea is to bring
everything in — from Opie’s
squanking of trashy Godzilla
scores (which has actually
invoked images of_the routine

destructions of h.o.—scale models
of Tokyo in audience members’
psyches), to Flemings’s favorite
single, “That’s The Night When
The Lights When Out In Georgia,"
by Vicki Lawrence, to Hineman’s
militant obsession with Mott, the
Hoople.

“We’re just interested in doing
something somewhat differently.
And frankly, we’re not be-boppers
and, quite frankly, probably never
will be. We're just trying to
develop a personal language that
reﬂects something about us that
hopefully will be interesting,”
Opie said.

So that's the spiel. It’s impossible
to provide the dimension of sound

‘ ‘cause there's no way to place the

notes on this paper. Screw the
biosphere, the BCCI scam and
everything else out of balance in
the world. Instead, clean your
apartement, trade some hot joe
for some matronly advice from
your neighbor Dorothy and head
down with your best buddies to
the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern
August 30, and have a gander.

Maddening is the only way to describe this moody Scottish outf1t’s
new effort. For die hard fans of this group, Real Life almost sounds
like their near miss, New Gold Dream. But it only contains half the
atmospheric sounds as Dream. But if you love" “See The Lights,” then
get the album. Otherwise  pray that American radiowises up and
plays “Promised You A Miracle." That’ll get Jim Kerr and Co. to go

the off-season exodus,

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Well, sports fans, this Saturday kicks off
(everybody now) the 102nd exciting season
of Pitt Panther football. If you have been
away all summ r from the university and
have not read anything in the papers, boy,
have you missed a lot. - .

Let’s recap the events that have taken
place in the past year:

0 First off, Pitt suffered it's worst record
since 1984 last year with a 3-7-1 record.

- Second, after coach Hackett suspended

nown course

him from the team, Curvin Richards decided
to forego his ﬁnal season in a Panther
umform and applied for the National Football
League draft.

-As if this was not enough, an in-house
investigation into the actions of former
assistant football coach Frank D’Alonzo was
started. The investigation was prompted by
allegations made by former players no longer
afﬁliated with the university that D’Alonzo
gave players cash and other gifts while at the
university between the years 1986 and ’89.

OK, everybody pretty much knows all of

THE PITT NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

 

9* New AD Jaynes ‘wants to be leader in reform’

it

 

By Scot Ross
Managing Editor

Having an athletic director with
a hands—on reputation doesn’t
seem to faze Pitt football coach
Paul Hackett.

“Anyone who recruits Bo
Jackson is okay with me, ” Hackett
said of Oval Jaynes, named to the
post Aug. 13 by President- J.
Dennis O’Connor.

Jaynes, 50, has been lauded for
his contributions to both the
Auburn and Colorado State
football programs, where he
served as an associate and athletic
director.

Colorado State football coach
Earle Bruce, who was hired by
Jaynes and guided the 1991 Rams
to their first bowl game in 42
years said, “I think no one could
be more supportive of football
than OvalJaynes. He knows what
it takes to win. It takes support of
the coach by the athletic director
and financial support of facilities.”

Support will be the operative
word at the athletic department
these days, given the recent dark
clouds surrounding Pitt athletics.

In addition to the fundraising
scandals that have not yet run
their course through the
department, the NCAA is
investigating rules violations by
former assistant football coach,
Frank D’Alonzo. Not to mention
that support from boosters and
administrators may not weather
additional inconsistent seasons
by the football and men’s
basketball teams. | ' .

“It’s important to win, don’t
ever forget that,” Jaynes said.
“But at the same time it’s important
to do it the right way. We want to
be competitive."

Jaynes will also be hard—pressed
to garner the full attention of new
president O’Connor, who will
have his own adjustment period

as he tries to win back respect for”

the university, which took its
lumps at the end of Wesley
Posvar’s tenure. V

"‘I certainly have no aspirations
to‘-’~the athletic director," O’Connor
said. “I want to be an effective

president.” He added that

“together” the two will work
towards reform in the athletic
department.

O’Connor tried to make light of
the fact that his first choice for
AD, Dave Hart, Jr., declined the
offer, with a quip that the man
“who’s last name begins with H"
he had wanted to head the
department was the late Chicago
Bears patriarch George Halas.
Beyond that, O'Connor would
make no further comments.

The two also had little to say in -
termsiof any immediate. plans for .

a new basketball arena.

“I think that it would  remiss
to say- that we are not also very
interested ‘ in improving our
facilities, so that five years from’
now or 10 years we will be at the
top of where we need to be. Not
a priority, but on the agenda of

things to look at in the future,”

Jaynes said.

As an athletic director you also I

would like to have more seats.
But coaches like to have home
court advantage. I’ve talked to

 

Jason Billings/The Pitt News

Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor introduces new athletic director

Oval J aynes to the media.
Paul Evans and I think he enjoys
playing in Fitzgerald. He thinks
it's a great place to play and a
great home court advantage,”
Jaynes said. I '
‘ Jaynes said that he is “an
educator first” and does not want
to be referred to as just a “football
man.” I
As an educator, Jaynes said he
is for the academicreforms set by
the NCAA in the past year. “I
want the University of Pittsburgh

to be a leader in that reform,” he
said. , .

Jaynes presently sits on the
policy-making body of the NCAA
which has been investigating
academics in athletics.

CSU’s Bruce‘ said academics
was a priority of Jaynes while at
the university.

“Certain schools have a
reputation for graduating athletes.
I think he’s kept those standards

0 Pitt starting offensive lineman
Mike LiVorio tested positive for
steriods in May and was
suspended for the season. LiVorio
protested, saying that the only
thing he used was Yohimbe bark,
a plant extract available over the
counter. It supposedly increases
a player's testosterone level The
NCAA denied LiVorio’s appeal,
and he will sit until next year.
This has prompted the Panthers
to scamper to find an offensive
line that will have some depth.
This has even involved the
switching of redshirt freshman
Reuben Brown, a former Parade
All-American, from defensive line
to the offensive side of the ball in
hopes of ﬁnding a solution. Jeff
Christy, a former punter,
linebacker, fullback, will start
now. This move is Christy’s fourth
in four years, leaving one to
wonder what the Panthers would
do without him to help patch up
their holes.

Continued from page D-6
windfall by signing both Ken
Ferguson of Texas andjohn Ryan
of Ohio. Both quarterbacks were
highly regarded by many scouts
as potential impact players, and
both chose to attend Pitt over
many other highly regarded
schools. ‘

The similarities between the
two end with their choice of
schools, however, as their styles
are as different as the areas from
which they come.

Ferguson, 6-feet 3-inches, 195
pounds, is regarded as a good
roll—out passer with a
tremendously accurate arm. He
led his Arlington High School
- team to a 9-3 record and a district
championship in his senior year.
Ferguson completed 167 of 389
passes for 2,702 yards and 20
touchdowns. In addition, he
rushed for 361 yards and six
touchdowns. He was selected to
SuperPrep’s Southwest All-
America team and was named
offensive player of the year for
Tarrant county. In addition to
football, Ferguson also played
baseball and ran track.

Pitt was not the only school to
come knocking on his door,
either. Ferguson had offers from
UCLA, Texas, Miami, USC, and
Houston, all renowned‘ for
producinghigh quality QBs.

Jaynes

[at Colorado Statel," Bruce said.

O’Connor said the 2.5 grade
point average required to play
football would not change.

“The athletic program will not

"dictate academic curriculum,” he
said.

Having suspended several
starters during his short tenure,
including running back Curvin
Richards, Paul Hackett may have
had worries about the new athletic
-director's dedication to
academics. Hackett seems
optimistic about Jaymes.

“With Dr. O’Connor and now
Oval,‘ I’m looking for- what I’m
trying to do and what this‘
university is committed to to now
be in place. That’s a load off me.
I don’t know if I’ll let him call any
plays or not, but he can definitely
recruit,” Hackett said.

Ferguson does not see himself
coming in and taking over,
however. ». I

“College football is a lot quicker,
a lot faster and takes a lot more
mental concentration than high

school,” Ferguson said. “I’ve got

a lot to learn. ’Iher’s just so much
to learn; you could never do it all
in one year, let alone fall camp.”
Ryan comes from Boardman
High School in Boardman, Ohio
—_— the same school that produced
Bernie Kosar. At 6-3, 195, he is
regarded as more of a pure drop-
back type passer with deadly
aim. Ryan led his team to a 9-2
senior year while passing for 1,990
yards and completing 116 of 202
passes. He broke Kosar’s records
for career passing yards and
touchdowns while at Boardman.
, He also saw action at
placekicker-and punter. He was a
pitcher and outﬁelder for the
baseball team, which finished
second in the state to the No. 1
team in the nation, according to
USA Today. Ryan was recruited
by Illinois and Louisville before

choosing Pitt.

Like Ferguson, Ryan feels that
coming in and taking over is not
possible.

“This is 300 times different than
high-school football. It's really

all the plays, personnel and
formations," Ryan said. “There’s

no way I could go out there and,

start and be successful.”
Ryan and Ferguson agree on

one thing -— the leadership” of

Alex Van Pelt.

“He’s like a second coach,’j
Ryan said. “He knows as much as
anyone out there. He can show
you how to do what you're
supposed to in any situation.”

While they ‘may not start this
year, head coach Paul Hackett

does not rule out the possibility"

, of one of them being the No. 2
quarterback. I

“I’m really happy with both of

them,” Hackett said. “They have

a real shot at the two and three _,

spots. They are really giving Joe
all he can handle. I see one of
them being,Alex’s back-up."

Experienced trio is cornestone of defense 

  
      

Jason Hillrnan/The Pitt News
Junior Sean Gilbert hopes to lead‘ the Panther defense with his
intimidating style.

By Scott Campbell
The Pitt News

For much of the 19803, the
pride of Pitt football was its
defense. Starting with Hugh
Green and continuing with Bill
Maas, Tony Woods and Marc
Spindler, the Panthers produced
some of the top defenders in the
country.

But thatwas the 19803. After a
3-7-1 season last year, the 19903
are off to a le3s—than-bright start.
A quick glance at some statistics
from the 1990 season reveals
some startling numbers.

0 Opponentsscored at least
21 points per game in the la
nine games. ‘

0 The Panthers gave up 293
points last year, the most since a
woeful 1-10 1972 team gave up
350. (That _performance
prompted Pitt to bring injohnny
Majors as head coach.)

0 The 293 points is three more
than Pitt gave up in 1980 and
1981 combined.

0 Take out 1912, and it’s more
than the Panthers gave up during
the decade of the 19103, a period
encompassing 74 games.

That is a disturbing trend for
Pitt, but there are at least three
Panthers who are especially
concerned —— senior linebacker
Ricardo McDonald and junior
defensive ends Keith Hamilton
and Sean Gilbert. Those three

have banded together to make

THE PI'l'l' NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

 

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Not so many years ago, the
strength of the Pitt Panthers
defense was the secondary.
Players like Billy Owens, Gary
Richard, Alonzo Hampton and
Dan Crossman were capable of
creating a game—turning big play
at any time.

However, in the past two years
the Pitt secondary has been
lacking in a person to step up and
take charge. Last year they needed
to replace three starters from the
year before; strong safety Louis
Riddick being the only starter
‘remaining from Pitt’s John
Hancock Bowl team.

The inexperienced secondary
struggled for. most of last year,
often being accused of not playing
hard enough and being too slow
to keep up with the opponent’s
receivers. Pitt allowed an average
of 397 total yards per game in
1990, and opposing quarterbacks
completed passes at a 58—percent
clip.

This year the story is much the
same. The only remaining starter

from last year’s team is sophomore i

Tinker Harris, who started only
after Dave Coleman pulled a
hamstring in the Notre Dame
contest last season. Harris also
had to sit out spring drills due to
an injured knee. As a result, the
Panthers resume the search for a

 healthy group of speedy defensive

backs.
Not all of the players the

 Panthers are looking to for
" answers are as inexperienced as

in the past, however.

As a «result of Harris’ injury,
Coleman regained his starting job
at right cornerback. Coleman runs
a 4.5-second 40-yard \dash and

 Widest Selection of Pitt Merchandise:

 

Sweatshirts

Secondary untested;
leadership sought

had 20 tackles last season before '

his injury. He is described by Pitt
secondary coach Nick Rapone as
a steady player who goes out and
does his job. In addition to decent
speed, Coleman also is a smart
player and a good technician.
Battling for the starting job at
left cornerback will be Harris and
senior Steve Israel. Israel played
in just five games last year before
suffering knee and shoulder
injuries. Israel also had to sit out
much of the 1989 campaign with
torn ligaments in his right knee.
While Israel may seem to be
injury prone, he feels that he has
come back in better shape this
year than he ever has before.

- “I worked a little bit harder to
get back this time,” he said. “I
worked all summer with new
strength coach Tim Wilson. He
had me run the parachutes to
increase my speed and strengthen‘
my quads and hamstrings.”

Israel feels that for the defensive
backﬁeld to have a succesful year,
they must be disciplined.

“Last year, we kind of got wild

and undisciplined at times, and

that causes mistakes. In order to
cut out those mistakes, we need
to do what we are supposed to,
not what we think we should
do.”

The safeties this year feature a
totally different look from last
year. Gone is Riddick, a four—year
letter-winner, and last year’s
starter, Doug Hetzler. Fall camp
featured battles for the starting
positions, with'Bobby Boykin and
Vernon Lewis emerging as the
apparent starters. V. g

In orderto increase depth this
year, sophomore Doug Whaley,
a linebacker last season, has

moved to strong safety. Also,’

New foes appear on schedule

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

For 101 years, Pitt never
played Southern Mississippi in
football. This year, however,
Southern Miss is just one of the
different names on the Panthers’
schedule, which also includes
Maryland and Minnesota.

Southern Miss returns 51
lettermen from last year’s 8-4
squad which lost to North
Carolina State in the All-
American bowl, but the Golden
Eagles lost star quarterback
Brett Favre, who went on to the
National Football League. His
replacement will likely be
redshirt freshman Eric Estes.
Southern Miss features a “No-
Name” defense that gave up
only 12.8 points a game in

1990. The Eagles also have a
new head coach in pass-happy
Jeff Bower.

The Pitt—Maryland series is
tied at two games apiece; the
last game being a 10-7 Terrapin
victory in 1986. Like Southern
Miss, Maryland also must
replace a veteran signal-caller.
Scott Zolak led the Atlantic
Coast Conference in passing
yardage last year. 1991 will be
the first year in a long while
that Maryland doesn’t have an
NFL-caliber player at

quarterback. The list of former _

Terrapin QB’s includes some

impressive names: Boomer
Esiason, Frank Reich and Neil
O’Donnell. The Terps went 6-
5-1 in 1990 against a schedule
which included six bowl teams,
but none of the returnees has
star talent.

The Panthers have faced
Minnesota ten times, but the
last time the two teams played
each other was 1958. The

_Golden Gophers hold a 9~1

series advantage. Minnesota
finished at 6-5 last year, just a
game out of first place in the
talented Big 10, and has 16
starters returning. However,
because of NCAA violations
which occurred when Notre
Dame Coach Lou Holtz headed
the program, they are banned
from playing in a bowl in '91.
' East Carolina appears on the
schedule again, for the third
meeting between the schools.
ECU linebacker Robertjones is
an All-American candidate and
one of the best inside
linebackers in the nation. The
Pirates last played Pitt two years
ago, losing a 47-42 shootout at
Pitt Stadium. This year, for the
first time, ECU will host the
Panthers in Greenville, North
Carolina. V
The 1991 Panther schedule
also differs from past schedules
because the opening game this
season ‘is against West Virginia
and not one of the sitting ducks

of recent memory: Paciﬁc,
Northern Iowa and Ohio

_ University.

Those three teams lost to Pitt
by a combined score of 132-16.
Obviously, that is not the same
point differential between Pitt
and WVU in the last three years.

Playing a big game so early
on is a concern for receivers
coach Jon Gruden, simply
because the receivers are not
an experienced group.

“They need to be in complete

command to be successful,"

Gruden said.

Not all the players feel that
the game is that much bigger,
ihowever. Veteran cornerback

Steve Israel said, “The first game -

is the first game. It doesn’t matter
if we play a Division II school.
We come out the same way:
excited and ready to play.” I
The fact that the opener is
“The Backyard Brawl” should

excite some players even more._ _

Another contrast to 1990 is
the placement of opendates in
the schedule. Pitt will play three
games, then get a week off

before playing seven straight“

weeks until November 9. The
players then get 18 days off
before the Penn State game.
Because ‘of the large number of
injuries last season, the Panthers

benefitted from an open 
weekend halfway through the

SCQSOD.

THE

PIT!‘ NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

Linebacker crew stocked with talent, potential

By’Jason Hillman

_ Setiior Photographer .

One of the things the Pitt

football team has not been weak.

in over the years is linebackers.
Hugh Green, RickeyJackson,Jerry
Olsavsky, Tony Woods and Zeke
Gadson are some of the greats of
the past.

The present has its great
linebacker in Ricardo McDonald.

Nelson Walker and Heath Snell.

  

And the_ future has Charles
Williams and Tom Tumulty. This
year's linebacking corps may not
be deep, but it has talent and

potential.
The outside linebackers are
deeper than the inside

linebackers, with McDonald and
veteran seniors Curtis Bray,
Nelson Walker and junior Heath
Snell.

“We have basically the same

  
   

group returning —— kind of new
and improved,” said Marvin Lewis,
outside linebacker coach. “Playing
experience in college football has
become a strength of our group,”
Lewis added.

Improved, as in both Walker

and Bray are relatively healthy as .-

compared to last year, when Bray
was hampered by injuries and
Walker sustained a season-ending
knee injury in the second game.

Scot Ross/The Pitt News

0 ' Outside Linebacker coach Marvin Lewis will be working with veterans  McDonald,lCurtis Bray, =

“I'm about 100 percent now,"
said Walker after a couple of days
at camp. “I feel quick, and they
say I look good when I run.”

"It looks like we might have
[Walker] toward the middle of
the year full swing,” Lewis said.
“And Curtis Bray has done a
good job of getting himself back,
physically ready, to compete and
to play."

Both Bray and Walker have
started in the past. But for now,
the starters are McDonald and
Snell.

“It’s always the best player out
there at any given time,” Lewis
said. “So it is [Walker and Bray’sl
ability to be a better player in a
certain situation than Heath or
Rico is that is going to get them
on the football field.” '

The inside linebackers are much

-younger in comparison. Mark

Shemanski, a redshirt junior, is
among the oldest of the group.

R ButWilliams, Tumulty and Hayes

Clark are_ young and eager to
make their "mark. .

“I played in every game last
year, ” Williams said. “Playing as a
true freshman with Craig Gob
and Prentiss Wright, that was an
experience by itself. Now I’m
taking from what I- learned then
and ﬁtting it in with what I’m
learning now.” ~

“Basically, [the inside
linebacker] "is supposed to find
the football,” said inside
linebacker coach Sal Sunseri.

“They have to make plays for us
or spill the ball outside to our
speed guys. Right now, we’re
probably bigger than we’ve ever
been inside. Charles is about 235
pounds; T umulty’s 235, and they
both run pretty well for their
size,” Sunseri said.

T umulty, a true ﬁrst-year player,
was the most heavily recruited
player in the WPIAL since Sean
Gilbert in 1988. He came into
camp second in the depth chart

behind Shemanski‘. But he was

still a first-year player on a Paul
Hackett football team.

“Coming in as a freshman, I
went in there the first dayjand I
couldn’t believe how difficult the

scheme was,” Tumulty said. “I ‘

studied about two hours the first
night. That morning I was so
depressed, I didn’t even want to
go to practice. But coach Sunseri
taught me everything. Mark
Shemanski and Charles Williams
really helped me out, and I picked
it up,” Tumulty said. ,

Both the inside and outside
linebackers have question marks
that can only be answered after
the season has started. Injuries
like the ones last year would
decimate them. But if they stay
healthy, they will be dominant.

“I can see it in guys’ eyes this

“year,” said McDonald. “Last year

was a learning year. This year the

guys want to do it. Last year there

was a new coaching staff, new

THE PITT NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

 

Offensive line looks
to fill two huge holes

By Scott Campbell
The Pitt News

Entering last season, Pitt’s
offensive line was a big question
mark. The Panthers had to replace
veterans Roman Matusz, Chris
Goetz and Dean Caliguire, all of
whom were 1990 National
Football League draft picks and
were still listed on NFL rosters
this summer.

The one positive that was
supposed to come out of the
situation was that last year,
everyone would get a year of
experience and come back again
this year with the line being one
of the team’s strengths.

But with the one-year

suspension of starting left tackle

Mike LiVorio, who tested positive
for steroids over the summer,
almost everything has changed.

Jeff Christy, a former punter,
fullback and linebacker who
started last year at right guard,
has been moved to LiVorio’s left
tackle position.

The trio of Dan Anderson, Tony
DeLazio and Lawson Mollica are
battling for Christy’s former right
guard spot. '

Senior Mark Fely has a “huge
hole in his foot,” and redshirt
first-year Panther Reuben Brown,
a Parade All-American in high
school has moved from defensive

‘without any

end to the offensive line to provide
some depth.

So much for planning ahead.

Only Scott Miller and Chris
Sestilli are returning starters at
the same positions they held in
last year’s season opener. Gary
Gorajewski started the last 10
games last year and is back at left
guard.

“We’re struggling [at offensive
linel,” said Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett. “We feel we’ve
weakened ourselves at two
positions right now.”

And depending on how fast
Brown develops at left tackle
behind Christy, Christy could
move again, possibly back to
right guard where Hackett said
that no one in the trio of Anderson,

DeLazio and Mollica is standing

out.

LiVorio was suspended for one
year for testing positive for
steroids. He said the positive
results came as a result of yohimbe
bark, a legal agent that is sold in
the United States.

“That was really a shock,”

Gorajewski said. “It’s really A

upsetting because you can get it
anywhere. [LiVorio’s suspension]
will be [a distraction] in a way.
But [Christy] is a good athlete,
and he’ll be able to take over
problems,”

Asst. Sports Editor

The new Big East Football
Conference won’t look like much

of anorganized league as it ,

opens its first season this year.
Some teams, like Virginia Tech

and Miami, will play only one or

two league games, respectively,

"while West Virginia plays all

seven Big East opponents this
year. Pitt plays five conference
games, joining Boston College,
Rutgers, Temple and Syracuse at
that number. '
Despite differences in
geography and ..scheduling,
however, the newest conference
power in organized football will
have a champion in 1991. '
USA Todaywill decide it, which
probably improves the chances

of several teams already.

A timetable has been set for
full conference play to begin by
1993, with each team playing the
other seven members at that time.

. “It's a new era in eastern

_football,” said Pitt Coach Paul

Hackett.

Most of the teams are familiar
faces to Pitt fans, with the possible
exception being Virginia Tech.
The Hokies formerly were a
football independent, and they
play basketball in the Metro’
Conference. They ﬁnished 6-5 in
1990, including a 38-13 pasting
of Virginia.

Virginia Tech has perhaps the
best-kept offensive secret in
college football in quarterback
Will Furrer. A senior this fall,
Fu rrer completed over 58 percent
of his passes in 1990, accounting

rm: pm News ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

for 19 touchdowns and over
2,100 yards.

Offensive lineman Eugene
Chung is expected to be a
candidate for the Outland

,Trophy, and Virginia Tech

returns 14 other starters from

last year.

Miami is a team Pitt has played

: off and on recently. While the

Hurricanes are usually one of

the nation’s most exciting and ,

controversial teams, a new look
might be creeping up on Miami.
A new athletic director (Dave
Maggard) was hired, and he has

5 promised to shore up the ‘Canes’
' weak academic standing. "In

addition, a new NCAA rule
penalizing taunting and
celebratory dances was largely
aimed at Miami, especially after
their 46-3 Cotton Bowl romp

over Texas on New Year's Day, a
game in which they racked up 16
penalties for 202 yards.

Off-the-ﬁeld problems aside,
Miami has plenty of talent on the
field, but this time the focus is on
defense. Linebacking and the
secondary are the strengths of
this unit.

Offensively, the big question is
whether or not Gino Torretta can
replace Craig Erickson at
quarterback. But there are plenty
of good receivers and backs
returning, as well as kicker Carlos
Huerta, who has been around
forever.

Syracuse returns several key
players from last year’s 744-2 team,
including quarterback Marvin
Graves and linebacker Dan
Conley. Four new offensive
linemen and a new coach adds
up to some early inconsistency,
however.

Like most of the other teams,
West Virginia has a potentially
strong defense. But the offense
is still unorganized and
inconsistent, especially at
quarterback, where turnovers
were a problem last year. Adding
to those problems are road dates
against Miami, Penn State and
Syracuse this fall.

Temple was the most improved A

team in the nation last year, and

 

 New league set to begin inaugural season

it wasn’t a fluke. Coach Jerry
Berndt specializes in resurrecting
programs. The Owls will have to
wait a few years before taking
the next big step, however,
because the talent just isn’t in
place yet.

Berndt must replace his entire
defensive line and quarterback
Matt Baker. The latter task should
be easier with the presence of
Anthony Richardson, who
engineered T emp1e’s 28-18 win
over Pitt last year. Road games
against Alabama and Clemson
this year point to an average
season. "

Rutgers had a good recruiting
class this past year, proving there
is some optimism there. But the
offense can’t score points, and
the defense wasn’t able to stop
anyone. Still, Big East exposure
will only help the Scarlet Knights.

Boston College is still, well,
mediocre. Popular long—time
coachjack Bicknell was ﬁred last
year, and Tom Coughlin has a
tough job ahead. Quarterback
Glenn Foley played well at times
during his first year but also

racked up 21 interceptions. T he-

defense is slow, and the Eagles
play host to Georgia Tech,
Michigan, Miami and Louisville
this fall.

1"’ Running gme questionab after ichards, Redmon losses

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

  
 
    
    
    
  
   
   
         
       
 

This year was supposed to be the year of another Heisman Trophy
candidate for Pitt. -
g It was supposed to have gone to Curvin Richards, arguably the best
running back in a Panther uniform since Tony Dorsett 1_ast put on the
pads forjohnny Majors in“1977. However, Richards took his act tothe
National Football League’s Dallas Cowboys and left the 1991 Panthers
looking for an answer. _ . ,

In a way, last year’s nagging injuries to Curvin could be a blessing
in disguise. It gave the Panthers the chance to give some other backs
an opportunity to gain valuable game experience, something that
cannot be substituted. Last year, the Panthers used three different
tailbacks, not counting Richards. s y

One player who benefited from the injury to Curvin last year is
redshirt sophomore Kevin Williams. Williams played nine games last
season, gaining 206 yards on 46 carries, a 4.5 yards per carry average.‘
He had the team’s longest run from scrimmage and was the third
leading rusher, finishing behind Richards and senior Glenn Deveaux.

However, Williams suffered a season—ending knee injury against
Miami and had to have reconstructive surgery. As a result, he missed

tailback. In the off-season, Williams worked to improve his speed and
endurance. '

“I worked with [new strength and conditioning] coach Wilson to
help improve my lateral movement and my overall speed," said
Williams. “I think that I'm back to 100 percent. Last year, I was still
learning the offense, and I think that slowed me down. This year I

I’m supposed to be all the time.” .

Christy are having to get used to
however, is playing side by side.

Gorajewski said that last year it .

long to get used to Christy.

“The offensive line is different
from any other sport in that you
can’t practice it during the off-
seasdn," said Bill Meyers, Pitt’s
offensive coordinator and
offensive line coach.

“You can’t go out and practice
blocking in the dirt. That’s a big
reason why they have pre-season
camp, to tune up the lines.”

held accountable for only three
sacks last year, the Panthers only
gained 1,531 rushing yards, over
700 less than opponents, and
their lowest total since 1986.

Of course, Pitt was without the
services of tailback Curvin
Richards for a part of 1990.

“I think we have to put last year
behind us," Christy said. “The
whole offensive line had to get
used to playing with each other.
This year we had a pretty good
spring, and we'll be ready.”

“We made a couple of mistakes
last year and beat ourselves,”
Gorajewski said. “We’re at camp
right now and are just looking
forward to West Virginia on
August 31."

Overview

Continued from page D—5
Redmon ruptured the Achilles’
tendon in his left foot. He had
surgery and has just recently had
his cast removed and begun
rehabilitation. Later in the month,
Terrance Wheatley and Derrick
Hicks were suspended for
allegedly stealing and using
teammate Lawson Mollica’s credit
card to go out to cat. As if that
were not enough action for one
month, cornerback Barry Threats
and receiver Darnell Dickerson
were declared academically
ineligible, both for the second
time — thus proving that those
who can't learn history are
doomed to repeat it.

-Then, Alex Van Pelt was put
into a holding cell for public
intoxication after an altercation
between him and another man
occurred outside a local Oakland
restaurant. Van Pelt maintains that
he was not drunk. The alleged
follow—up supposedly was the
reason that star wide receiver
Olanda Truitt asked to be released
from his scholarship and
transferred to Mississippi State.
At the same time, defensive back
Tinker Harris began hinting that
he might transfer, but after talking
with coach Hackett and thinking
it over, he stayed.

-The one positive occurrence
during the sumer was the hiring
of new athletic director Oval
Jaynes from Colorado State.
Jaynes has a history of building
winners, as evidenced by his work
at both Auburn and Colorado
State. Jaynes has a history of
being a “hands—on” type coach

' and athletic director. While he

does not want to be considered a
“football man” but an educator,
Jaynes approach seems to breed
a winner almost automatically.
Jayn-es ability will be tested
immediately ashe tries to clean
up an athletic department recently

damaged, deal with the ﬁndings A
of a current in-house investigation _

that keeps producing new
findings, and try to update the
Pitt athletic facilities to keep up
with other Division I—A schools.
So, as a new season approaches,

problems only loom that much
larger.

Many have said that the.

Panthers’ success depends on
whether or not they can win in
their first game against West
Virginia. If the Panthers win, they
might go 7-4, if they lose they
probably will not do any better
than last year. The key to a
successful season for the Panthers
does not center on the “Backyard
Brawl,” but on the following game
against Southern Mississippi. west
Virginia looked impressive
against the Panthers last year, but

finished with a 4-7 record, losing
their last five games to such teams
as Rutgers, Boston College. and
South Carolina. Southern
Mississippi went 8-4 last year,
defeating Alabama, Louisville and
Auburn. Southern Miss. returns

14 starters from last year and will

provide Pitt with a better
indication of where they stand.
This will be Pitt’s first home game
since all of the well-chronicled
eventstook place. Winning this
first home contest can set the

‘tone for the entire year. Losing

could mean another long year.

Expectations high for three
new additions to Pitt offense

Jason Hillman/The Pitt News

Senior Pbotograber

With Cu rvin Richard's

departure and the injury to Ronald
Redmon, the Pitt running backs
lost a couple of steps coming into
fall camp. Fortunately, they also
picked some new feet.

The feet belong to Curtis
Martin, Vince Williams and Tim

Colicchio, Pitt’s first-year running
backs.

“I’d imagine we would find a
role for all those guys,” running
backs coach Skip Peete said.
“Right now, I couldn’t say he’s
gonna help us here, or he's
gonna help us there, but they
have the ability to help us.”

Both Curtis Martin and Tim
Colicchio are’ local prospects.

Martin, six feet and .185 pounds,
is from Allderdice High School
and was a top Pennsylvania
running back despite only
playing one year of high—school

attack in the tough Southeastern
conference.

With these two gone, the
Panthers lost their two top wide
receivers, leaving the jobs open
to a young, inexperienced group
of hopefuls.

Entering fall camp, it looked as
if the Pitt passing attack might be
limited to backs coming out of
the backfield or to the two
experienced tight ends, seniors
Dave Moore and Eric Seaman.
However, the addition ‘of one
junior-college transfer and several
first—year students to the plan has
helped bring back the hope that
this decimatedpositon will prove
to be a bright spot in 1991.

The receiving corps is now
anchored by senior Chris Bouyer
and redshirt juniorjunior Green.

_ .. ..._.. ......z-4

Both have seen playing time in (.__

the past years, but sparingly. ‘

Bouyer caught seven passes last
year for 72 yards, while Green
snagged ﬁve receptions for 85
yards.

What they may lack in receiving
numbers, they make up for in
confidence. ’

“I think we are very talented,
and we have a lot of speed,”
Bouyer said. “We are pretty
conﬁdent, and once we get some
more experience, I think we'll be
able to show just what we really
can do,” he said.

Green feels as sure about-this 

year’s squad as Bouyer.
“Chris andl have played in

_some big games, and we know

what it is like to be there. We’ve
come out with some new tactics,
and I think we will surprise some
people,” Green said. = J
Bouyer and Green are not the
only two players expected to
play the receivers spotsithis year.
Two redshirt first—year Panthers,

Bill Davis and Chad Askew, are 

expected to receive generous '

amounts of playing time as well.
According to Davis, the losses

It's the dream of every first-
year student: stepping on the
college field to make an impact
and beginning a successful
college career immediately.

Unfortunately, for most high-
school stars, the reality is a redshirt
year spent learning the system on
the practice field. I

But the situation might be
different for several Pitt recruits
this year. Faced with inexperience
and a lack of depth at several
positions, the Panther coaching
staff is turning to a few highly
regarded _incoming first—year
students and junior-college
transfers _- to help shore up the
holes. ~ S A '

A place where new players will
definitely help is in the backfield,
where first—year runners Curtis
Martin, Tim Colicchio and Vince
Williams will help ﬁll the gaps
left by CurvinRichards’ departure

-top

Depletion of deh gies young blood to chance to start

and Ronald Redmon’s injury. But
there are other spots where first-
year players have an opportunity
to step in right away.

One position which needs
immediate help is inside
linebacker, where Paul Hackett
looks to replace starters Craig
Gob and Prentiss Wright.
Sophomore Charles Williams is
pencilled in at one spot, with
junior Mark Shemanski at the
top of the list for the other. Pitt’s
recruit, Parade All-
American Tom Tumulty, has
already been put high on the
depth chart, right behind
Shemanski. ,

Tumulty, a product of Penn
Hills High‘ School, was rated
among the top linebackers in
the nation as a senior. He
recorded 125 tackles and was

‘selected to USA Today's All-

America team. He chose Pitt

over such schools as Michigan

the other quarterbacks. Glenn Deveaux will talk with the
tailbacks. As far as leadership is concerned, that’s something
you have to do on the ﬁeld. Lead by example," Van Pelt said.

Van Pelt added he’s more comfortable with head coach Paul
Hackett’s offense this fall than during any previous season.

“It’s not thinking about it anymore. It’s instinct now, and it’s
been a lot of fun,” Van Pelt said. “This is the best camp that I've
had so far, as far as knowledge of the offense and what has to
be done,” he said.

“The other guys are struggling, which we knew they would,"
said Hackett. What he has to do is work on his consistency in
his ability to concentrate, from the time he steps on the field
until practice is over. He has to avoid those lapses where he just

tries to carry the whole team himself. So far his arm looks good;

he looks like he's ready to go.”

doesn't make many mistakes and
is very fast. He has the ability to
catch, and that’s one thing we
always want to see in our running
backs.”

Colicchio is from Erie and
went to school at Erie Cathedral
Prep. The 5-1], 208-pound first-
year student was the Bobby
Dodd State High-School Back of
the Year, rushing for 2,355 yards
on 215 carries for an impressive
I 1 yards a carry. He also managed
a 3.7 grade-point average.

“Tim Colicchio has done the
same things that Curtis Martin's
done,” Peete said. “The thing
I’ve noticed about both of these
guys is that they’re great students

of the game. Whenever there’s a .

meeting or anything going on,
anyone explaining anything
about a play, they’re taking notes.
They want to write down

 

everything that we say.”
However, it's not as easy for
the new backs as it sounds.
“It’s a lot different than high
school,” Colicchio admits. “The
mental part of the game — a lot
more thinking — and more
detailed plays; you’ve really got
to study. It takes up‘ most of your
day. You have no free time.”
“We have to learn different
form and types and every
different kind of formation for
plays. ‘We have to do everything
nearly perfect,” Martin said. “I’m
still in the learning process, trying

, to get it together.”

“It’s what I expected,” said
Vince Williams. “Having to get
up early in the morning and go
to practice, then practice again
in the afternoon, then meetings
at night. In a way itteaches you
to mature and be a young man.
I’m glad I have a chance" to,

contribute as a freshman.”

Williams, 6-2 and 21 5 pounds,
hails from Lynchburg, Va., where
he was named first—team All-State
even though missing three games.
Unlike the other two, Williams
has been projected at fullback as
well as halfback. He can bench
press 415 pounds and runs a 4.5-
second 40-yard dash.

‘“He’s a big, strong kid with
really good speed and catches
the ball well out of the backfield,”
Peete said, “and that’s the one
thing we really liked about Vince
when we saw him on film when
we were recruiting him.”

One or more of the three
backs may get serious playing
time, especially if there is another
injury to one of the older runners.

“They’re all in the hunt,” said
head coach Paul Hackett.

“I just want to help the the
team and get some playing time,”
said Williams.

“I can come in there and help
out for Kevin [Williams] or J.
[Jermaine Williamsl,” said
Colicchio. “When they need it, I’ll
be ready.”

in the off-season are something
that this year’s team has to put
behind them. “It’s the
evolution of football. When
someone goes down, somebody
else has to be there to step in and
fill his position,” Davis said. “I
think that we all have the right
attitude and talent that it is going
to take to succeed,” Davis said.

Askew agrees totally with Davis.

“I think we have a lot of ability, ”
Askew said. “What we are lacking’
in game experience, we make up
for with our eagerness and
wanting to play,” he said.

First—year receivers’ coach Jon
Gruden should have a healthy
challenge for his first season with
the Panthers. However, Gruden
expresses much of the enthusiasm
that his players do.

“We have a lot of healthy
competiton,” Gruden said. “If the
players can learn the offensive
system quickly, we should have a
pretty smooth transition. Right

' now, we have about seven or

eight people that are looking
pretty good. They are all eager to
play and are very talented,”
Gruden said.

In addition to the existing
players, the Panthers got two key
recruits to help strengthen the
position.

Parade All—American Dietrich
Jells of Tech Memorial High in
Erie signed to play for Pitt. Jells,
6—feet 1-inch and 170 pounds,
runs a 4.3-second 40-yard dash

and caught 26 passes for 625
yards and eight touchdowns his
senior year. He also returned
three kickoffs for touchdowns.

The Panthers also inked a
burner in junior-college transfer
Dave Nottoli. Nottoli, 5-7, 160,
runs a 4.4 40 and averaged 27.5
yards/catch last year for Glendale
(Calif) Junior College.

One other key ingredient that
helps make replacing two key
receivers easier is returning
quarterback Alex Van Pelt.

“It’s great to havea quarterback
like Alex out there,” Green said.

“When you are just learning
the routes you are supposed to
run, it makes it easier when you
know that the ball is going to be
where it's supposed to be.

"Alex is like an on-ﬁeld coach.
When anyone has a question in
the huddle, he explains it to them.

He makes it a lot easier to do your.

own job,” Green said.

Notre Dame.

“I hope to help out as much as possible,”
Tumulty said. “If they [the coaches] feel I’m
ready to play, then I’ll play.”

Another inside linebacker who could see
some time is Jimmy Morrison, since veteran
Mike Boykin left the team this summer. Morrison
is one of two recruits from Virginia.

Another local product, Mike Halapin of Kiski
Area High School, has impressed on the defensive
line. Although small for a collegiate down lineman
(six-foot four-inches and 240 pounds), Halapin
was a second—team.all-state selection last year
and generally regarded as the number two area
recruit, right behind Tumulty.

Although the tight end position is deep this
year, next year the Panthers will be without
seniors Eric Seaman and Dave Moore. Junior-
college transfer Rob Coons was supposed to be
a key reserve, but he was sidelined by injury.
Enter ﬁrst—year student Marcus Harper of Houston,
Texas.

Harper is described as an excellent blocker

\ with 4.6 speed in the 40-yard dash and could get

a chance to play a role in the offensive scheme,
providing him with much-needed experience.
Wideout Dietrich Jells is the second Parade
All—American that Pitt signed this year. Jells
could help to replace the losses of Darnell

Dickerson and Olanda Truitt. Jells caught eight I

touchdown passes and also returned three
kickoffs for scores at Erie Tech Memorial High
School. Jells was also a top sprinter in high
school.

J-C transfer Dave Nottoli has also been

impressive in drills at the receiver spot. The 5'7" '

speedster from California averaged 27.5 yards
per catch and 24.5 yards per kickoff return last
year at Glendale Junior College.

While all the new talent is impressive on
paper, the combination of eagerness and
inexperience generally equals inconsistency.
Veteran players and the coaching staff will have
to assimilate younger players, like Tumulty, into

the Pitt system.

“My position coach [Sal Sunseril knows how to
teach people," said T umulty. “Mark Shemanski
and Charles Williams really helped me out, and
I picked it up.”

THE PIT!‘ NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 26, 1991

However, head coach Paul
Hackett sees Williams’ time
limited to two-back and 1-
formation sets. “When you have
a light guy like Kevin trying to
‘run up the middle out of a one-
back set, you aren’t going to be
very successful,” Hackett said.
The player Hackett sees as the
potential answer to the Panthers’
lack of size at tailback right now
is redshirt sophomore Jermaine
Williams.

“Jermaine looks pretty good

" right now,” said Hackett. “I really

like his work ethic. I like what he
has retained from spring drills
and what he's learned in the first
two years. I think he is ready now
to go in and feel confident.”

Williams played in eight games
in 1989, gaining 63 yards on 12
carries, a 5.3 yards per carry
average. However, he injured his
left ankle early in 1990 fall camp.
In the time since then, he has
worked to get back into better
shape than he was before.

“I’ve worked harder than ever

to recover from this. I’ve gone
from running a 4.5-sec. 40 [-yard
dash] to a 4.4,” Williams said.

Williams’ work has not gone
unnoticed by the Panther
coaching staff, either.

“Jermaine is stronger and bi gger
than he was before,” said running
backs coach Skip Peete. “He has
the size, speed and ability to
make things happen."

The one back that both Peete
and Hackett recognize as the top
player in the Panther backﬁeld is
Glenn Deveaux.

“Glenn is definitely the most
impressive back we have
returning," said Hackett. “His
knowledge of the offense and
the way he helps the younger
backs, it shows that he really got
ready to play this year.”

“All of the other backs look to
Glenn for leadership,” said Peete.
“He is the most experienced, and
he can _play both positions."

Hackett says that Deveaux, who
played both tailback and fullback
last year, will play fullback
exclusively this year. This move

is spurred mainly because of the
loss of senior fullback Ronald
Redmon until early October after
he had surgery to repair an injured
Achilles’ tendon. Redmon had
his cast removed August 12th,
and has begun rehabilitation with
pool exercises.

While returning players are
slated as the starters, several of
the new "first-year recruits are
expected to make significant
contributions. Curtis Martin of
Allderdice High School in
Pittsburgh is expected to see
playing time in the Panther
backfield at tailback. Also, Tim
Colicchio and Vince Williams will
get" some action in the Pitt
backﬁeld this year.

The Panthers’ young backfield
faces a stiff challenge in the first
game against West Virginia, but
they feel that they will be up to
the test. _

“It should be a good challenge,
and we should be ready,” said
Jermaine Williams. “A tough test
