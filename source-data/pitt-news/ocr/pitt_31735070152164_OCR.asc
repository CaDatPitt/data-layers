Justice ‘Sonia
Sotomayor
  inspires '

. Staﬁ" Writer

At 8 years old, Sonia Sotomayor learned how’
to give herself an insulin shot. She had just

beendiagnosed with_diabetes and was 1isten- A

ing to her parents ﬁght about who should
be the one_to give her the shot, when she
decided to do itherself. ' I

This steadfast determination led Soto-
mayorto be the third woman and ﬁrstperson
of Hispanic heritage to earn a-seat on the U.S.

' Supreme Court. _ . _
“I’m just stubborn,” Sotomayor said. “I_

just really don’t want to give in.”

Sotomayor, U.S. Supreme Court justice
and author, visited Carnegie Music Hall on
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. to talk about her meme
oir, “My Beloved World,” in an interview with
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. About 1,900‘
people attended the hour—and¥a-half—long,
talk, which was part of the Pittsburgh Arts
and Lectures program.

Sotomayor has served as an associate
justice of the U.S. Supreme Court since Au-
gust 2oo9. . A ‘ '

Pitt researchers author study on oncogenes, combat cancer > progression

Em Maier -7-
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

A team of researchers from institutes in-
cluding Harvard, the University of Texas
and the University of Pittsburgh might
untangle the complexity of cancer pro-
gression and etiology.

Jennifer Grandis, assistantvice chan-
cellor for research in Pitt’s department
of otolaryngology, authored the study
that examined the oncogene STAT3 —— a
gene with the potential to generate cancer
— and its relationship to head and neck
cancer. The scientiﬁc journal Proceed-
ings of the National Academy of Sciences
published the study last month.

Grandis, a professor of otolaryngol-
ogy and pharmacology and the program
leader for the University of Pittsburgh,
Cancer Institute’s Head and Neck Cancer
Program, is one of many scientists who
were interested in the transcription factor
and oncogene of the same name.

Oncogenes are of great scientiﬁc inter-
est. Nature Publishing Group, an inter-
national publishing company, devotes a
weekly academic’ journal to the subject
of oncogenes.

“We and many other people had no-

ticed that STAT3 was turned on in cancer “

cells. In these cases, there were very high
levels of STAT3,” Grandis said. i

‘ Previous research had demonstrated
the correlation between increased activa-
tion of STAT3 and unfavorable prognosis
for cancer patients. Recent reports from

hyperactive gene to ﬁnd the cause of the
activity change. ,1‘ .

They found that altered protein ty-
rosine phosphatase receptor, or PTPR,
"genes generate phosphatase proteins,‘
which then phosphorylate — or add a
phosphate group onto —-the STAT3 gene,
thus, activating it. - ’

. -45

  “But when we blocked -STAT3, /it
seemed to inhibit cagnceregrowth.”

Jennifer Grandis

the journal Nature Medicine estimated {

that 95 percent of head and neck cancers
overexpress STAT3.

“But when we blocked STAT3, it
seemed to inhibit cancer growth,” Gran-
dis said. , .

The researchers analyzed related pro-
teins for mutations that could induce the

“Our ﬁndings suggest apreviously
undescribed, and potentially common,
mechanism for dysregulated cell survival
and growth involving PTPR mutation and
STAT3 hyperactivation,” the study’s re-
searchers, including Vivian Wai Yan Lui
from Pitt School of Medicine’s otolaryn-
gology department, said. .

The team beganlooking to see if there
were mutations, but team membersfound

“none. The next question -then became
whether a mutation upstream —— that ‘

wouldaffect how the gene gets turned
on — was causing this hyperactivation.

When they could not ﬁnd anything, 1
_ the researchers searched downstream

—— where. the mutation would affect how

- the gene turned offe for deactivated pro-
, teins.’ The‘ team targeted the PTPR gene, ~ .

which codes for receptor’-type tyrosine
protein phosphatases and is implicated in
the regulation of both inter and intracel-

. lular signaling.

From‘Grandis’_perspective, the phos-
phatases “were wildly mutated.”

Such loss—of-function mutations could
affect the brake systemof STAT3. In other

words, ratherthan aproblem of cancer-

ous growth stimulation, there might be a

problem with tumor suppression. '*
Although her research focused on head

and neck cancers, the paper reported that

, all tumor types analyzed have displayed

an “unexpectedly hig ” frequency of mu-
tations. ‘ t ’

SOTQMAYOR

The ﬁrst pages of her memoir, published
injanuaty 2013, detail Sotomayor’s decision
to give herself the insulin shot. Sotomayor
elaborated on her childhood growing up in
a housing project in'The Bronx, N.Y., where
she attended local Catholic schools.

Sotomayor described herself as an “or-
dinary person blessed with extraordinary

opportunities,” citing her close relationship -

with her grandmother as a large inﬂuence
on her success today. ,

“To be a successful adult, you must have
one adult who loves you unconditionally,”
Sotomayor said.

Sotomayor earned a scholarship to
Princeton University and graduated summa
cum laude in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts

degree in history. She attended Yale Law~

School and graduated with a juris doctor-
ate in 1979. 1

Before President Barack Obama nomi-
nated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in
2009, she had a long career as a lawyer and
a judge. V T ‘

Following her graduation, Sotomayor
served as assistant district attorney in the
New York County district attomey’s oﬂice
until 1984. She moved on to serve Pavia &
Harcourt, a business law ﬁrm, until 1992
when she started serving on the U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New'York until
1998. From 1998 until 2009, Sotomayor
sewed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeal
for the Second Circuit.

Nordenberg said Sotomayor, a best-sell- 1

ing author, was “America’s ﬁrst celebrity
justice.” ' 
Sotomayor said she wrote her memoir

to connect with readers on a personal level.
She said American citizens hear about Su-
preme Court decisions,qbut do not know
much about the justices beyond what they
do for a living.

“If you really want to touch people, you I

have to open yourself up to them,” Soto-
mayor said. 
Sotomayor asked the audience member

to consider what they are doing to change '

the issues that trouble them.
Sotomayor told of the adversities she
had faced growing up. ‘ '

Her father was an alcoholic and died

when she was young, leading her to form
a close relationship with her grandmother
and her cousin. I 4.
1 Those relationships faced more insta-
bility. g_ p ~

‘‘I watched my cousin die of heroin and
AIDS,” Sotomayorlsaid. “I realized that giv-

ing up meant Iwould ‘go down his road.”-
She targetted the many students in the
audience and took a few moments to-advise

p aspiring lawyers.

“Remember always what the purpose
of being a lawyer is — service,” she said.

Several students who attended the lec-
ture were enlightened by the event.

Emma Feyler, an undeclared freshman, .

said she liked the justice’s viewpoint on the
necessity of unconditional love from adults
and connected with Sotomayor’s messages.
“If I could pick anythingin the world to
be, it would be a ‘Supreme Court justice,”
Feyler said. u . ‘ ‘V l ‘ .
Toyin Ajayi, a freshman majoring in biol-
ogy, said she was not normally interested in
this kind of lecture, but was impressed with
the discussion. »
“[Sotomayor] is a person who could in-
spire people from all walks of life,” she said.

because there are links that guide stu-

cludes links for students to click on if
they have questions about the request
or are confused about what information
to include in their request. A
Nites said that in the past there was
often confusion as students made re-
quests for their student group, and the

‘ information on the request form would

be incorrectly ﬁlled out.

“If it was really bad sometimes we
would’ have to delay the request at the
meeting and then have the student re-

Nites said. A ,

Nites said that the online allocation

In terms of therapy, Grandis suggests
that a new line of research could explore
the efficacy of STAT3 inhibitors.

“I think it’s hard to "tell. Right now, this

This could become therapeutic, rather
than preventative, by developing [STAT3

Julia Carpey .
Columnist

Each day one of the most under-
reported and hideous crimes go
largely unpublicized .

Human trafficking of girls is a
tragic act that hardly receives pub-
licity and what is more, not nearly
enough has been done to curb it.‘

Barbara Amaya, now a spokes-

woman in the ﬁght to make people '

aware of human trafficking, ran
away from home multiple times be-
fore her 12th birthday, until a young"
couple found her on the streets of
Washington, D.C.

They brought her to their
home, “groomed” her '-— a pro-

cess of “breaking—down” a girl

from healthy adolescent sexual

OPI   IONS  

boundaries to commercial sex with
strangers — and took her out with
them. By the time she turned 12,
her pimp had already set up several
clients in D.C. for Amaya.

“I grew up being trafficked. I
grew up in the streets. Like a wild
animal,” Amaya said in an inter-
view with The Pitt News.

One of Amaya’s earliest memo-

ries is of being sold from one pimp ,

in D.C. to another in New York City.
“_I remember watching the
money change hands,” she said.
“I was sold like a piece of furniture
in our nation’s capital. Iwas 12 and
nobody did anything to stop it.”
Amaya continued. .
“I’ll never forget the times [my
pimp] beat me incessantly with

coat hangers. Blood soaked my

Human traﬁicking remains unrecognized,

shirt. I don’t like to tell too much
because it becomes voyeuristic, but
I was lucky to survive,” she said.’

Amaya, now inher 60s, has be-
come a symbol and spokeswoman
on the subjectof human trafficking,
educating the public about to
stunt its disgusting growth.

The lack of awareness, unfortu-‘ -

. nately, makes it seem as though no

change is in sight. With more edu-
cation and awareness, this heinous
crime can be brought to light and V
effective change and prevention
can occur.

, Shockingly, there are more

. people subjected to slavery today
than the total number of peoples

taken from Africa to Americain the
trans—Atlantic slave trade. _
Human trafficking, commonly

divided into subcategories of sex '

trafficking‘ and labor trafficking,

is the third-largest and fastest- -

growing criminal industry in the
world, according to the South-
western PennsylvaniaAnti-Human
Trafficking Coalition in Pittsburgh.

B The United Nations and U.S. De-

partment of State estimated that in . 4

2011, the number of people being

.trafﬁcked worldwide was more

than 209 million. Other sources,
such as End Human Trafﬁcking
Now, based in Switzerland, esti-
mate the number to be more than

29 million.-

The fact that the numbers ﬂue-
tuate so drastically is nothing to
be surprised about, unfortunately.

Kelly Kochamba, an FBI spokes:
woman in Pittsburgh, agreed.

deserves consideration .
_ Editor’s Note: The following piece includes some graphic material. Reader discretion is advised.

“It is difficult to provide con- e_
’ crete local statistics because'some-

body might be picked‘ up in one
place and trafficked elsewhere. It

also has become increasingly more .

difﬁcult with the develcpment of
online human trafficking,” Ko-
chamba said.

 T ~_ Last February, WTAE-TV‘ Pitts-

burgh reported on an investigation
that ‘exposed sex trafﬁcking in an
undisclosed hotel in Oakland, the

_ heart of whereinost of the Pitt

community resides. In it, a37—year-
old male was charging $300 aturn

for customers to use a 15-year-old

girl as a sexual object. H

There are afew components, aside from

as barriers for women wanting to escape.

Apart from said pimp, who is typically older .
than the woman and often casts himself as a .

Amaya, previously addicted to heroin

-while beingtrafﬁcked, said she was 5—foof-9

and maybe 90 pounds at her lowest point
duringher experience with drugs and traf-
ﬁcking. . i , ’ -

“I have been raped more times than I can
remember,” she said. 7 A I
_ At 19, Amaya ranaway and hid from her
pimp countless times. She did so to both
save money for her drugs and to escape his

wrath. He always ‘came after her, beat her p’

relentlessly and dragged her back. The last  

time, he never came for her. Amaya found]

out years later thathe had been arrested on
drug charges and "died in jail. , v . .

Amaya now has a daughter with her for- -
' mer husband, has written a‘ book and spends

her time battling human traﬂicking. Amaya
went ‘public with her-story after realizing.
she was a victim of human. trafficking while
watching a story about it on the local news. ‘
She had no idea that the crimes committed '
against her constituted as human trafficking

largelybecause of the brainwashing effects «-

the acts had upon her as a victim.
A But Amaya sees apurpose in the tragedy.
“Ibelieve I went through what I did so I

Most victims are not as luckylas Amaya.
While she got out by chance, many women
don’t know there is "help for them. They have

‘ access to safe houses, hotlines, clothing, hy-

giene products and communication devices
to assimilate into" everyday life through local
coalitions andiprograms. , .

"A Mary ‘Burke, director of the doctoral
program in counseling psychology at Car-
low University and executive director of the
Southwestern Pennsylvania Anti—Human

Traﬁicking Coalition,‘ said, “T-he effective-

ness of [the coalition] is it gives the com-

, munity one place to send their resources

and the victims one known place to turn.”
According to the FBI, a common miscon-
ception surrounding sex trafﬁcking is it only
affects a speciﬁc demographic of lower-class
women from broken homes. Most people

f believe that pimps only prey on young girls

who come from abusive homes, are runaways
and arehighly vulnerable. While this demo-
graphic is oftenamain target, middle- to
upper- class young girls are certainly not
immune. - b ‘ ;
Girls are typically trafﬁcked as young as
12 years old and, on some occasions, even
youvnger.‘Amaya said these girls are coerced

with threats, empty promises and physical
and emotional abuse, which leads to intense
psychological and physical trauma.

“It is manipulation and preying on a
population that is already vulnerable,” said
Amaya.

'_Amaya said that trafﬁcking is a fast-grow-*

ing issue “because people are being viewed
as commodities that can be sold and used

over and over.” ‘

But the government is taking steps to
combat the issue. FBI headquarters has made
it a stronger priority in the next ﬁscal year
than in the past, and human traﬂicking is

i now its own entity, whereas, previously it

existedas a subsection of civil rights viola-
tions, according to Kochafnba. .
While legal reform is the ﬁrst step toward
change, huge strides cannot be taken without
societal transformation. This begins with
the basic awareness and recognition that

human trafficking is a signiﬁcant problem _ . , ,_
' in all cities andsuburbs.

Amaya agrees.

“As a survivor and an educator, I believe
that nothing else will happen if there is not
ﬁrst awareness,” she said. -I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt aims to
bounce back
at Miami

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team has gone cold,
but not because of the city’s frigid weather.

The Panthers are still clinging to a spot in
the Associated Press top—25 poll, but are now
in the midst of the team’s first losing spell of
the season. .

The No. 25 Pitt Panthers are looking to heat
up the south in tonight’s matchup with the Mi-
ami Hurricanes at7p.m. at BankUnited Center.

Hurricanes head coach Jim Larranaga
dished praise to the Panthers after Miami’s
win Saturday over Norfolk State.

“We’re gonna work very hard on a our de-
fense and rebounding ‘cause we know how
good Pitt is,” Larranaga said. “They’re one of
toughest man-to-man defensive teams in the
league. They’re also very tough offensively.
They just got a really great team.”

Then Larranaga, speaking the day before
Pitt faced Virginia, looked ahead.

“They’re very deserving of their top—20
ranking. I think they’ll have a great game
against Virginia,” he said.

The result certainly wasn’t great for Pitt
(18—4', 6-3 ACC), which lost to No. 11 Duke
and No. 20 Virginia last week. Both defeats
happened at the Petersen Events Center in
different fashions.

The Blue Devils gradually pulled away
from the Panthers en route to a 15-point win,
whereas, the Cavaliers relied on a last—second
3—pointer by Malcolm Brogdon to snatch a
tough roadwin. Pitt’s home losing streak is the
ﬁrst time the Panthers have lost back-to»-back
games at the Petersen Events Center since
losses to West Virginia and South Florida in
2012.

Despite the tough week, Pitt is still tied

Just a few weeks ago, Duke.was 1—2,in the
Atlantic Coast Conference, and its matchup
this past Saturday against Syracuse was

5 supposed to be just another game for the

undefeated Orange. _
Duke then won ﬁve straight, and a

record—crowd»of 35,446 was on hand at ‘
Carrier Dome to greet the,Blue Devils ina 4

matchup thatfeatured the two winningest
coaches in the history of college basketball.

Syracuse edged Duke, 91-89, in an over-
time thriller, which was tagged by ESPN
play—by—play analyst Dick Vitale as the best

game he’s seen in 35 years of calling college‘

basketball.

It was the fourth—most watched regular-5

seasoncollege basketball game on ESPN
since 2002, earning a 2.9 Nielsen rating,

compared to the 2013 Stanley Cup ﬁnals,’
_ which came in at 3.3.

And to Syracuse fans’ immediate wish-
es, No. 1 Arizona fell to California,'60-58,
just hours after the ﬁnal buzzer sounded in
Syracuse. So the Wildcats swapped places

with Syracuse in Monday’s Associated

Press poll.

“It puts a target on yourback, knowing .

everyone is coming after you,” Syracuse
forward C.J. Fair said to reporters after

the Orange’s 61-55 win over Notre Dame‘

on Monday.

Three teams in particular —— No.25 Pitt,
No. 11 Duke and No. 20 Virginia —— are after
the bull’s— eye that Fair described. Syracuse

 _ ‘ is scheduled to play all three teams on the

road this month.

For now, though, the Orange remain,

perfect.

Syracuse-(22-0, 9-0 ACC) _

Head coachjim Boeheim’s system does
notpave the way for blowout wins, but it
does allowfor Syracuse to grind teams out
in the ﬁnal minutes of play. The Orange
have displayed a rare attribute — the abil-
ity to win without starlit performances
by Fair, a National Player of the Year can-
didate. ‘ ~
‘ On Monday, Trevor Cooneyis 33.points
and nine 3-pointers made up forFair’s
meager six points, and Syracuse held on
late to beat the Irish and extend its school
record for consecutive wins to start a sea-
son. Before Monday, Cooney had shot just

V» 25 percent from behind the arc. *

Virginia (17—5, 8-1 ACC)

Senior guardjoe Harris has under'per-
formed this season, and the Cavaliers do
not have a consistent scorer. But for now,
they’ve shown no need for one.‘ For the sec-
ond week in a row, Virginia owns the No.
1 scoring defense in the country, holding

‘ opponentslto a mere 55.5 points per game.

 The Cavaliers play the easiest schedule

in theACC and should have no problem A

with ﬁve of their remaining nine games,

whichare against the worst ﬁve teams in»,

the league. The team also faces Maryland
twice,:Clem_son and Syracuse.
Duke (17—5, 6-3 ACC) _ _
Despite losingat Syracuse "on Satur-
day, the Blue Devils have been on a recent’
tear. The prime reason for their late suc-

- cess has been perimeter shooting, where

they rank sixth nationally at 41.4 percent.
The‘Devils feature the top three 3-point
shooters in the ACC-, as well: Rasheed

T Sulaimon (48y”p,ercent)l, Andre Dawkins

(47.2 percentland Rodney Hood‘ (-44.7

‘V percent). Yet,'when a team such as Duke

has problemswith consistency, analysts

_question whether thatteam is builtfor

success in March. . __
Pitt (18-4, 6-3 ACC)

The pressure is on the Panthers to ,

gather one signature win. They play just
one more signature team — Syracuse — next
Wednesday. Pitt must win because right
now, the Panthers’ NCAA Tournament
resurné remains blank. Guard Lamar Pat-

- terson has made just 25 percent of his at-

C temptedljshots in two home losses to Duke

and Virginia, and no one has statistically
compensatedfdr his poor play.
North Carolina (14—7, 4-4 Acc)

T After a remarkable start to the season
with wins over Michigan State, Louisville
and Kentucky, the Tar Heels then dropped

“their ﬁrst three league games — their

worst start to ACC play in more than a
decade. Since, North Carolina has won
4—of-5, but still has to play host to Duke
and Pitt next week.
Clemson (14-6, 5-3 ACC)
I . The Tigers will get a crackat Syracuse
on Sunday, three days before the Orange
travel to Pittsburgh to face the Panthers.
K.J. McDani'els,'a 6-foot—6 forward,
leads his team in scoring with 16.7 points

L.

per game and leads the ACC in blocks with ~

2.65 per game.
\ Maryland (13—9, 5-4 ACC)
The Terrapins’ best player, Dez Wells,
showed up late to a team breakfast last
week, and coach Mark Turgeon did not

start him against Virginia Tech. Wells re- .

sponded by scoring 19 points in 30 min-
utes of play. Maryland will play Florida
State on Saturday.

North Carolina State (14—8, 4-5 ACC)
The Wolfpack have now won 3-of-4 and
are set to face Miami on Saturday. Guard
T.J. Warren is in the midst of a brilliant
sophomore campaign in which he has
posted 22.4 points per game.
Wake Forest (14-8, 4-5 ACC) T
.Wake Forest continues its dependency
on youth-. ‘
The Demon Deacons have seven soph-
omores, ﬁve of whom scored in double

V ﬁgures against NC State several games

ago. They don’t have a bad loss necessar-
ily, bowing to Xavier, Tennessee, Kansas,

‘ Virginia, Syracuse and Clemson, but they

haven’t collected a signature win.

Florida State (.13-8, 4-5 ACC)

The Seminoles have now lost three con-
secutive games, falling to Duke, North
Carolina State and Clemson.

Georgia Tech (12-10, 3-6 ACC)

The Yellow Jackets have struggled in
ACC play, in part because they lost their
leading rebounder, Robert Carter, to a torn
meniscus. They’ll have a chance to upset
Virginia at home Saturday.
