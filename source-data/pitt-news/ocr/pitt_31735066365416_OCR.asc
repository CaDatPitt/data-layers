For 18-year olds

  Draft status   "1H’ formed A

l i WASHINGTON (AP) - A new
‘ draft classification was created

Tuesday for 18-year-olds and old-

..~er men with such high lottery
7 numbers they’re unlikely to be

called into military service.

Selective Service also laid-down
the new ground rules for personal

K appearances before draft boards

for a youngvman to make “a fair
representation of his claim” for

exemption or deferment. At the

‘same time there’s a built-in brake
designed to keep protesters from
overloading the boards with ap-

' peals.
Deputy Director Daniel—J. Cron-/

in said the new “holding” classi-
fication, 1H, is designed. to en’-‘
able the service to “do business
with the people likely to be draft-
ed and let the other people go

about their business.”

The rule changes put the draft
operation in line with the new

draft law, including the passing .

out of college, trade school and
junior college deferments. They
become automatically effective

in early December, 30 days after‘

they are published in the Federal
Register, as required by the new
law.

A major change not required by
law wipes out the catchall IY
classification that lumped togeth-
er men with borderline physical
disqualifications, homosexuals,
criminals-, and a Variety_ of
others. From now on a man in this
area will be given 4F as physical-

ly unfit, 1A-RR1, meaning being.

adjudicatedfor 1A-A0, meaning
acceptance undetermined,

who enter military service, join
reserve units, or are sole surviv-

ing sgns- They will remain‘ there '
'until their lottery in 1973, when
‘Selective Service wil\announce a '

cutoff lottery number.

Those below that number will
remain in 1H and those above will
be classified 1A or any exempt or
deferred classification for-which
they qualify.

cutoff number will be announced
after the 1972 lottery and, men be-
low that number will be reclassi-
fied 1H, where «they will remain
until they reachrage 26, barring
emergency. _ -
‘Men exposed to the draft as IA
this year or earlier but were not

their 26th birthday.
The new personal appearance

John_Kerry .ogcInizer of the April I971 encampment of Vietnam

Nov. 5, 1911 A

 

Veterans against the War, urges Pitt students. to make a “consciousi.j‘. 

commitment” against the War.

John Kerry, outspoken war op-
ponent raked those who classify
anti-war protests as futile and
urged about 300 Pitt students to
"make a conscious commitment’
to end the war"in a Wednesday
evening speech. -

“Those ofius who intellectua-
lize and consider ourselves aware
tend to turn our backs on some

of the realities that could pro-«

duce change,”. the lanky veter-
an declared.

Classifying many Americans
self-pitying

sults from these c‘ynics is that
the efforts of people like myself
go right down the drain-."

‘ After one student questioned
the value of the forthcoming
November 6 protests Kerry re-

sponded, “don’t kid yourself to

,~ his grandmother in a house which had been burned
by Germans at the end of World War II. He had play-
ed in their formerbunkers. , ‘

That experience, Kerry said, is probably one

have been repelled by the Vietnam War. For most,
the realization is apocalyptic-—one man finds a
mangled child, another sees his best buddy killed in
action. And suddenly there comes that gutty: gag-
ging reaction. The war must be ended.

But it was no apocolypse that caused one vet-to
protest the war. His disgust began the moment he

stepped off the plane onto Vietnamese;soil—way back .

in 1966 when it was not fashionableto unbelieve in
the war.

It bothered John -Kerry, outspoken memberof
the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, that poor
Vietnamese peasants “were huddled all around the
airport and nobody cared.”

And it bothered John Kerry when he saw little
old Vietnamese grandmothers running around pick-
ing up the half-smoked cigarette butts of Ameri-
can soldiers. '

And when John Kerry got to his barracks he was
disgusted “to see that it was the Vietnamese who
were cleaning the bathrooms and the latrines and
sweeping the floors of the barracks" while Ameri-
cans talked about what they could do for the Viet-
nam War.

Those kinds of obser" étions accumulated. Kerry
told me he couldn‘t even put his finger on the day
he knew he had to protest the immorality and un-
fairness. '

A “It was just all my feelings," he said, “I came ,

to realize what we were doing was wrong . . . that
we werebeing dominant in a vulgar, repulsive way.”

Hisrational outlookvwas based on a childhood

experience. He lived in France for ,a few years with

reason why he had insight into what it was like for -

those Vietnamese peasants to live in an occupied
country.

The Navy awarded Kerry a Silver Star and a
Bronze Star. for -bravery. Kerry said, however, that
the medals were given him “for staying alive” and

- “acting like a human being.” (Kerry once returned

to an ambush to rescue a buddy.)

‘But how, I wondered, could a compassionate
man retain that humanity and l’esprit de vivre amid
such horrible circumstances?

“We’d walk through rivers and swamps in » a
raid," he said, “and when we finished we’d come
out in the South China Sea of the Gulf of Tonkin and
we’d take a swim. The seas were beautiful.”

Despite the knowledge he soon had to return “it
was a respite.”

Inevitably, the War changed Kerry, but he hasn’t
had a chance to reflect on how it has changed his life.

“I ‘can say" though. it made me fatalistic and
maybe a little tougher," he said. “It was an educa-
tion to see what human beings were capable of do-
ing to other human beings. ’

“It was a downer.”

But despite the dispassionate, matter.-of-fact
manner Kerry displayed in talking_of his personal
experiences, he burned .vith an inner. fire as he talked
of the tougher battle he fights at home. '

‘ ‘'/.‘You see, -you’re alivefand that keeps you go-
ing,”he explained..'4fThere’g.gotta be,hope.”V ’ i

For men turning 13 this year,a     
“ a.nti-war apathy

war. But don't kid yourself to

think it’s not worth it. Instead’

remember that Nixon will’ take‘

it as another jndicatioh that we: ’ '
are active, that we do care, and  -

that we're not going to quit.”

The leader of the Vietnam Vet- . Iii‘

erans Against the War reflected’

on his experiences while touring ‘

the nation. "I’ve found that there 
is a vast segment of people 
around the country who are sud- " I

denly aware that the thing.call.-:

"People seem to have the feel-.. A’
ing that some Americans just I
can’t scale the wall of success 7
and that there are many others--‘V
"Wh0' can’t even begin to "see

over it,” Kerry quipped.

nually control $150 billion worth
of purchasing power. If you real-

ly meanbusiness you can stop
using it and bring all these _pobl- ; f_;.

uters to their knees.”-

"In a lot of cases,” Kerry. said,i.i_f ..
"men see the Army as an o.utle._t7. 

from the welfare cycle.".

  

Commenting on hisown com-_  

bat experience Kerry continued,

"it. seemed that blacks-.\were 

placed in divisions that saw the:

most combat. And while 45% of_
eligible Mexican-Americans and  ,_
'Puerto Ricans will see action in
Vietnam, only 19% of the ,Anglo- ’

"for over half of the tonnage"

, Reverend Moses Stith, the new
‘chairman of the Pitt Chaplain
I Association, is attempting to co-
ordinate a religious» program
which will more involve the
administration, faculty, and
student body of the University.

‘ His program involves three
-_main ideas. First, an attempt
" will be made to establish a true

communication with students.
 Secondly, an interrelationship
 will be set up between the fa-
’ culty, administration, and staff
*5’. of the Association.

Third, the Association will
speak out on wider topics,
‘ instead of confining itself to re-
ligious issues. V
_ “The Chaplain Association
’ has been around for a long time,”
 said Stith. “Now it is expanding
—  in its approach and reception.”
 For example, he added, at the

-'_~Associa,tion’s next meeting mem-
bers of the Black Action Society
have been invited to communi-
Tcate their views.

_. Once a month leaders from the
' 12 churches involved in the Uni-
'versity Chaplains Association
 meet to discuss and establish a
fellowship between themselves
‘-and their churches.

“Each denomination has its

Hf own program, declared Stith.

one another; however, they are
capable of coming together/and

operating as a unit.”

At the last meeting the Associ-

» ation ratified an affirmation of

support for Soviet Jewry. In
their statement they included the

idea that exit permits should be ,

available to all Soviet Jews who
wish to leave. » .

Virginia and has been preach-
ing, he says, since the age of
five.

"You really couldn’t be effec-
tive in the ministry unless you
go to school, go to seminary; and

acquire an expertise in minis-~

try.”

"The primary way I see my-
self going is towards black re-
ligion. black theology. and the
black church," he explained. “It
has played a vital role in the
past. but I feel it will play a
more vital role in the future.”

Stith has been involved in the
black ministry of several other
colleges in Pennsylvania. He is
attempting to establish full-time
black chaplains in these col-
leges; He is also coordinator of
a gospel service, drawing sing-

This year, there has been a
significant increase in the
number of organizations apply-
ing to the Student Publications
Board for recommendation as a
student publication.

In early October, recognition
was granted to the University
of Pittsburgh Free Press. to be
published bi-monthly. with a
news-magazine format. Operat-
ing without the pressure of the
Pitt News three deadlines per
week. the Free Press will deal
with retrospective analyses of
national and local events.

The Schools of Education and
General Studies have been in-
vestigating the possibility of ex-
panding their newsletters into
recognized publications.

The School of Education
claims that their news is not be-
ing adequately covered in cur-
rent circulations, while the
School of General Studies al-
leges that frequently the Pitt
News is distributed at such
times that it is unavailable to
the General Studies student.

Board meeting Wednesday, Rob-
ert Bretz of the Air Force ROTC

 Campus organizations
ment ask publication status

be to articulate the thoughts.
aspirations and values of those
students ‘contemplating service
to‘ their nation in the Armed
Forces.” '

The charter further contended
that "no existing student publi-
cation has heretofore served the
purpose of providing a focal
point for the evaluation of such
ideas and issues.”

The Board, however, passed
a resolution denying recommen-
dation of “The Gremlin.”

According to Director of Stu-
dent Publications Eleanor Walsh,
“Although the Board feels that
it is very important for the
military ,viewpoint to be ex-
pressed on campus, the Board
does not‘ feel that, since the
Gremlin is a single issue-orient-
ed type of publication, it should

be financed by the Student As- ’

sociation.”
.However, the Board did urge

the studen.t«s~to try to establish_

a military-oriented publication
along the guidelines set forth
in their charter, but within
their own organization.

Each of
groups complained that the
Pitt News is not adequately
covering events and ideas rele-
vanttothem.

Walsh, however, -'stated the
“Pitt News” makes an effort
to cover as many student groups
and activities as possible but
has to operate with and staff
limitations.

However, she hopes that the
PitttNews will make an effort
to concentrate more on student
activity news.

Bill Gormley, Editor of the
Pitt News, considers the School
of General Studies claim that
the News is distributed at awk-
ward times “tommyrot.”

f‘If anyone is hurt by the
arrival time,” he said, “it’s the
commuter who generally leaves
at 2 or 3 p.m. and doesn’t get
the paper until the next day.”

“I can sympathize with the
Schools of General Studies, Edu-
cation, Nursing and Pharmacy
in that their activities are not
covered as thoroughly as those
of CAS Arts and Sciences). I
should hope that these schools
would sympathize with‘ our
dilemma of- space limitations,”
he said. _

“Of course,” he said, “if the
Student Associations were will-

ing to give usa more substan-.
tial allocation, we would happily «
‘publish materials from the vari-

ous schools frequently and
thoroughly. Unfortunately, the
Student Association does‘ not

appear disposed to bestow such
favors on us."

Pharmacy gets .33 came.

by LOIS LEVINSON

Plagued by robberies and shop-
lifters, the University Pharmacy
has turned to violence as a
means of prevention.

According to John J. Jar-
zynka, a pharmacist and owner

of the drug store located at

394 Forbes Avenue, there have
been four serious robbery at-
tempts made in the last three
years. Two of the attempts were
successful and the robbers got
away with an undetermined
amount of cash. They were
never apprehended.

In addition to the robberies,
Jarzynka’s father, J. A. Jar-
zynka, said that shoplifting is

Academic quality seems to be
the prime consideration of pro-
spective graduate students, with
social climate apparently assigned
minor importance, according to
an informal Pitt News survey.

Allan Kleinburd is currently
in the process of applying for
law school; however, he is also
interested in other forms of grad-
uate study. Kleinburd remarked
that if he couldn’t get into "one
of 4 the better law‘ schools, I
probably wouldnTt go to law
school at all.” He pointed, out
that graduates are likely to face
considerable difficulty in find-
ing jobs, unless they graduate
from a major college.

Kleinburd also remarked that
he’d "like to get out of Pitts-
burgh,~.i’ although he would like
to ‘attend school in or near a
major city. English universities
are especially appealing to
Kleinburd, who feels such a
choice could provide an ex-

" tremely worthwhile experience.

Another student, Ronaele
Novotny, said she found the
Counseling Center here at the
University somewhat helpful in
finding the names of good

‘schools, but of greater assistance

admits that Pitt students make
up the main part of his clien-
tele. and he cited .them as respon-
sible for most of the shoplift-
ing.

Things were different"before
Pitt became a state-related
school, he said, “and now be-
cause kids are going to school
for practically nothing—they
think we should give them our
stuff for nothing.”

Still, he claimed, the store

which schools to apply for, she
“actually” relied more on in-
formation obtained ‘from indivi-
dual professors here at ‘the
University.” '

Lew Hamelly is still in the
process of applying to,various
schools. Hamelly said he had
faced no really serious“ problems
thus far, although "it’s a bit of

a hassle trying to get informa--
' tion from different schools.

There’s a lot of time involved
filling out forms,” said Hamelly.

Another grad school applicant
remarked that it was “very sim-

that mothers have come in and
asked to be waited on while
they send their children around
the store to shoplift.

"The worst part,” continued
Jarzynka, "is the namecalling.
You wouldn't believe the things
they say.’_’

As‘a consequence of all the
petty theft, threats, and actual
robberies, the younger Jarzynka
got a_ .38 caliber revolver and a
gun permit about a year ago
which he now keeps on the pre-
mises. ~

with an overflow of forms from

Roberts, graduate school ad-
visor.
Roberts also said that the

Until recently, Jarzynka nev-
er had to use the “protective
measure,” although he brandish-
ed the gun several times as a
scare tactic or to hold a suspect

' till the police came.

Around 7:15 on Thursday,
August 28th, he found use for
the gun. According to Jarzynka,
he was alone at this time in the
store with. his pharmaceutical
intern, Jill Sargr. A man,enter—

from under a jacket that was

ing a move to get the drugs,
Jarzynka got his revolver from

with the man till they were at
the door. .
He said that he told
the man that he’d shoot hi_r'n“if
he ran, but that the man fled
across Forbes Avenue. As‘ the
man ran, Jarzynka fired two

by Bill Gormley
; Editor
This ‘article is the third of a
‘series on campus religious phe-
nomena. Stories on the Hare

Krishna movement and witch-
craft will follow.

“Where are the scissors?”

“Could you pass the scotch
tape?.” ,
_ “What happened to the
glue?”

The youths are playing with

red construction paper, P111‘ P19
yarn, “Smile” emblems, and

‘‘ paper plates. With an air of

   

The Lutheran Center’s

determination, they are fash-
ioning works of art — in the

modern sense of the word,‘

at least.

But don’t interrupt them, be-
cause the scene is deceiving. You
are in the middle of a religious
service at the Lutheran Center
on Forbes Avenue, and the liturgy

' e is resuming.

. Aself.-described country bump-

A. kin beams as he displays a fluf-

fy flower. “Back to nature!“ he
exclaims. “There lies the truth.”

A nursing student holds up a
disc with a smile" on one side
and a frown on the other. “Truth
is reality,” she intones. “It in-
cludes the good and the bad.”

To another student, truth has
sof.t edges; his exhibit is envel-
oped by a soft plastic cloak.

-Still another youth captures
_the “back to nature” theme with
a flower; cleverly, he hides
the flower behind a paper plate-
the camouflage of science. When
he reveals the flower to the
group, it wilts. Science, in the
form of impotent Elmer’s Glue,
has spoiled nature again.

The Lutheran Center’s “experi-
mental liturgy” is merely one
example of campus religion that
is increasingly responsive.

The University’s religious or- '

ganizations are, to varying de-
grees, ‘responding to changes in
student attitudes and tastes. -

The ‘Responsive’ Reformation

To Rabbi Boris Racovsky. head
of Hillel on campus, responsive-
ness is practically a sacred word.
"We’re totally responsive to stu-
dent needs,“ Racovsky declares.
"In fact, we regard our role as

I_ an aiding and abetting role."

Hillel’s services are conducted
by students. and its projects are
pursued by student volunteers.

Recognizing student dissatis-

faction with formal structures,

Hillel has abolished student offi-
cers and eliminated membership
dues.

Recently. it set up ‘a Sunday
night coffee house — Cafe Tel
Aviv —— which offers a casual at-

“do-it-yourself’? liturgy captivates a K small
group of truth-seekers.

The Oratory, Pitt’s Catholic
parish, is changing much more
slowly, but the iceberg of a
new direction is already visible.

Currently, the Oratory is spon-
soring an Ingmar Bergman film
festival — a startling step, consid-
ering the fact that Bergman does
not seem to believe in God.

Exit Macrosystems

The Lutheran Center’s shift

 

A crowd of 200 plows mechanically through
~ day morning folk Mass.

Can Responsiveness save the

in emphasis has been among the
most dramatic. The Center used
to be issue-oriented, and heavy
raps on racism, the war. and the
Military — Industrial Complex
were common.

But today the Lutheran Cen-
ter is a place where “small. in-
terpersonal things are possible.

according to Pastor Charles
Carlson.
Carlson, a socially -conscious

minister with the fierce mien of
a Van Gogh self-portrait, attri-
butes the turnabout to changes in
student needs and desires.

“Students are fed up with ma-
crosystems.” Carlson explains.
Personal development is_of more
concern, it seems. than social
progress.

Handling Heads

"At the moment.“ Carlson puts
it, “there is a good deal of need.
for ‘head handling.’ Students
are appealing to the Lutheran
Center for counseling. and the
Center is ameeting that need.
Last year. the Center applied
salve to 368 psyches (and hearts).

“Our Center has become more
consciously a caring-for-people
center," Carlson explains.

Where does ' religious consul-
tation end and personal counsel-
ing begin? Is the Lutheran Cen-
ter any less religious for minis-
tering to personal needs?

Is the individual who “raps”
with his buddy Chuck Carlson
seeking God or trying to cope
with some personal hangups? Is
there a difference?

Is student introspection lofty
or is’ it merely a form of ego-
tripping?

Carlson believes ‘ that wide-
spread introspection may be ne-
cessary before better institutions
can be developed and new social‘

assaults can be launched.

You must love yourself before
you can love your neighbor. Carl-
son observes, and he draws an
analogy with the black‘ man’s
need to develop his own con-

sciousness before interacting
with whites.
Are ego trips proliferating?

Perhaps. But the Lutheran Cen-
ter, Carlson insists, “is commit-
ted to helping people be secure
enough to get past an ego trip."
Like Carlson, Rabbi Racovsky
is not worried about student in-
trospection. “There was a time,”
Racovsky recalls, “when the stu- _

the ordinary of a "Su-

dent was looking very much to-
ward what to ‘do for the next
guy.” Now that the war is wind-
ing down and student values have
filtered through the media to
Middle America, the need for

student crusades is perhaps less
urgent.

At Hillel. as at the Lutheran
Center, counseling is very popu-
lar. "Counseling plays a major
role in our total operation,” Ra-
covsky observes. Draft Counsel-

ing is particularly popular. ‘
Mating and Dating
Like the Lutheran Center,

Hillel is finding value in mic-

and needs.
Take language. for example.

The Jargon Thing

Chuck Carlson uses the hip lin-
go and makes no apologies for it.
“Are ya with it, Bill?" he greet-
ed me, with a "revolutionary”
handshake. "Yes. I will use jar-
gon.” he says. “Naturally, I use
language that is appropriate.”

Racovsky and Kaufman deny
that they mold their jargon to
fit Consciousness III culture.
“It would be chutzpah to try to
ape the student,” says Racovsky.
However, intentional or not,
Kaufman admits he may ask a
student what his “bag” is or if
he’s into the rock “thing.”

Father Gene Green of the Ora-
tory. in‘ contrast. greeted me as
"Mr. Gormley.” Asked whether
he uses drug culture metaphors
to relate ‘more easily with stu-
dents, Green said a phrase like,
“Turn on to Jesus” or “Get high
on Jesus” would be “aesthetical-
ly unacceptable” to him.

Similarly, the Oratory’s “folk”

_ liturgy is by no means as avant-

garde as the Lutheran Center’s.
Indeed, it does not appear to have
changed in the least over the
past several years.

Ho-hum Liturgy

ago in 1 the Common Facilities

rosystems “We’re experimenting
with small groups,” Hank Kauf-
man of Hillel explains. Interac-
tion at small group sessions is
more intimate and genuine than
at large ones.

Hillel is also responding to the
social needs of students. Hillel
has sponsored picnics, brunches,
a swimming party, a bowling
party, a roller skating party -
everything short of computer dat-

Unusually sensitive on this

point, Kaufman denies that Hill-
el is a “mating and dating serv-
ice.” Sure, Kaufman admits,
“kids.come to parties to meet
other kids. We endorse this but
don’t promote it.”

Racovsky and Kaufman seem
anxious to dispel any impression
that they are actively nurturing
young love.

The Oratory too sponsors social
evens. Last Friday. they held a
Halloween dance with a live
rock group.

In comparison with /the Hillel
and the Lutheran Center, how-
ever, the Oratory seems much

less responsive to student values

._ we
a'_, -

 

ed responses and stale songs.
Some Catholic devotees wereso
mesmerized by the service that
they kept their heads buried in
their literature for the “Our Fa-
ther” — a prayer which most
have recited thousands of times.

Except for a mildly rousing
“Lamb of God” round, the serv-

icelacked’ vigor. And it clearly.

lacked spontaneity. When the
time came for a “Kiss of Peace,”
many in the crowd were a con-

‘tent with a bland handshake —

displaying a warmth that was
skin-deep at best.-

Most disturbing was the serm-
on delivered by Father Green,
who denigrated man by denying
man’s intrinsic worth.” All right-
eousness,” Green said, “comes as
a gift from God.”

Man's worth, Green continued,
is derived from God. Finally, he
accentuated the negative: "The
universality of the condition
which is sinful excludes no man
from its grasp.”

The Relevance of Irrelevance

.Father William Clancy, head
of the Oratory, reveals a similar
conservatism. “The relevancy of
the Church is to be irrelevant,”

old-time religions from irrelevance?

Clancy says, with the confidence
of an old saw. He urges that the
Church must speak to human
problems that transcend the mo-
ment, the place. '

Clancy scoffs at suggestions
‘that the Oratory should address
itself to immediate social prob-
lems, arguing that the Oratory
cannot be “merely another agen-
cy for social change.” Asked if
priests should comment more on
concrete social problems, Clancy
raises the specter of pulpits fill-
ed ,by "third-rate Walter Lipp-
manns.” P .

Perhaps because of its intran-
sigence, the Oratory is exper-
iencing the “winter -of fa1th’.’

which John Wright predicted be-,

* fore he left for Rome.

- “The Oratory does experience
the leaving of a noticeable num-
ber of students from the estab-
lished‘ Church and from tradi-

tional ways of experiencing the

Catholic faith,” Green admits.
But, he adds, attendance at Ora-
tory services has increased in re-
cent years.

Despite its outdated liturgy and

rhetoric, the Oratory is not ob-

- livious to the changing values of

youths.

“We’ve reached a kind of wat-
ershed in history,” Clancy ob-
serves. Religiosity -and patrio-

' tism, he says, have lost their

hold. "We’re not going to have
a happy return,” Clancy says, to
a “my country or church — right
or wrong” philosophy. “I would
not want there to be one.”

Reauthentication

The l Church and - the 'State,--L

Clancy, concludes, have to "re-

» authenticate”.themselves.

To reauthenticate themselves,
the Lutheran Center and Hillel
have responded to- thef'.n‘eeds of
students. Personal counseling, so-

1

cial “happenings,” and innova-
tive liturgies represent attempts
to meet these needs.

The potential for campus reli-
gious organizations is enormous.

Personal development and social
contacts are prime goals of most
students, and religious groups.

are uniquely equipped to respond
to them.

friends. These are common hum-

goes to the’ very core of life. v

Religious groups ,-must serve’
and respond. -If a need exists for"

"mating and dating,” why be
afraid of responding to it? If stu-
dents need tete-a-tete counseling
to ease. the pain of alienation,
why shouldn’t religious groups
help?

Religion cannot be divorced
from human problems. The link
between religion and life is be-
coming increasingly explicit on
this campus, and the trend may
prove the salvation of organized
religion.

"Religion has to be -an intrin-

sic part of life,” Rabbi Racovsky
declares. “Unfortunately, reli-
gion has been something juxta-
posed on life whichreally doesn’t
serve life. Religion must be re-

 Eegistration: pink slips kill thigh htopes 

,§;,_Friday,

 

by STEVE FRIEDMAN

Pressured by time constraints,
requirements, and closed courses,
many students find the registra-
tion process distasteful.

Though some students can choose '
their courses with relative free-
dom and pursue their personal in-
terests, others must adopt a more
practical viewpoint. One senior
nursing student explained that all
courses are prescribed. “I go to
my adviser and sign a pink slip,”
she said. “Relatively few times‘
do I receive a choice.”

Time is an important factor in
the registration process, particu-
larly for commuters. “I plan my
classes for Monday, Wednesday,

The Exorcist by William Blatty
$6.95, 340 pp. Harper & Row
"We like to think that we live in an en-

lightened age, a time when logic and sci-
ence are replacing the superstitions which

' V have haunted mankind for centuries.

 

There is some evidence to support this
conclusion; consider the educational level

‘ of Americans today as compared to that of

the past, the decreasing percentage of the
'populus on church roles, the increasing

1 number of individuals claiming to be ag-

nostic or atheist and the increased em-
phasis on science in our schools.

_ How then can we explainthe popularity
of a’ book such as William Blattyfs The Ex-
orcist, and more generally, the recent and
widespread interest in such subjects as
witchcraft, devil worship and psychic
phenomenon?

This interest is revealed through the

current wave of horror movies, the unpre-
cedented rise of witch cults throughout the

University of Pittsburgh.

The Exorcist is presently number one.
The Other by Tom Tryon is now number
three. 1

This sudden interest in the occult may
have the same origin as the recent religi-
ous revivals among American young peo-
ple. In -spite of man’s scientific break-
throughs, heart transplants, moonflights
and advanced technology there is one ques-
tion that he cannot logically answer.
"What is death and what happens to us

, when we die?” Our quest leads us to both

the occult and religion; for both of these
subjects give a reassuring answer to this
question. V

One might well ask how a book such as _

The Exorcist, which deals with devil wor-

ship, religious blasphemy and sexual per- _

version, can be reassuring. It reassures us
because if, we can believe in the power of
evil and the existence of the devil, then
surely we can believe in the power of

goodness, the existence of God and there-

fore an afterlife for man.

I do not wish to imply that The Exor-
cist does not merit its position. Blatty’s
novel is carefully researched, well writ-
ten and extremely suspenseful. There-
fore, the book should notlbe started the
night before a test, because the reader is
likely to forget about studying.

The novel concerns a 11-year-old girl
who undergoes a monstrous personality
change from a normal child to a demon-
like creature. ' .

The main characters (her mother, her
tutor, friends of the family and a priest)
ask the same question as the novel’s read-

‘ers, “Is the-child-really possessed by a
devil or is she only suffering from some

strange personality disorder?”

This question is particularly trouble-
some to the principal character, the priest-
psychiatrist,.who must decide whether the
child is eligible for an exorcism, a Catho-

- lic religious service for casting out male-

volent spirits. While the priest ‘demands

The book is credible because William
Blatty’was educated at the Jesuit George-

setting of the novel. The author has done
extensive research on witchcraft, demono-
logy, and the church's attitude toward
these subjects. 1

For those who doubt the existence of
demons on earth, Blatty cites instances of
extreme sadism which have occured in
modern times and are so monstrous that
they make us wonder if man could have
perpetrated ,them without some demonic
help. " -

The Exorcist is better than many nov- 1

els of its genre.

A high level of suspense is maintained
throughout the work. In short, it is one of
those novels which make dark, stormy
nights so much fun. .

I Seven years ago, the Fathers
of Notre Dame University must
have been quite upset about the

fortunes of the Fighting Irish‘

football team. The squad, which
boasted the winningest tradition
in college football,
sported a winning record in six

The Irishmen looked to North-

Ara Parseghian and decided that .

national championship. -
Two years ago, Ara’s era at
Notre Dame extended to an
of a post-season

years for the South Bend team.

Ice, hockey club faces Duqltesne
in first ‘home’ game at Alpine

The Ice Hockey Club, a team
that has rapidly become one of
the biggest spectator attractions
at Pitt, will open its home season
this Sunday, Nov. 7.

The ice matches will be held at

' the Alpine‘ Ice Chalet in Braddock

Hills. Sunday’s contest, which
commences at 7 p.m., will feature
an improved Duquense squad.

“We didn’t play them last year,”
commented veteran goalie Mark
Lieberman. “C-MU beat them

A badly and we beat C-MU.

“They’ve improved though,”
Lieberman ‘added. “This year
they’re better than the Tartans.”

Providing its—re_quest for money
goes through, the Ice Hockey Club

will eventually be offering free
bus transportation to and from
the home contests. No transpor-
tation will ‘-be available for the
opener.

The rink can be reachedby tak-
ing the Parkway East to exit 11.
Make lefts at the first two inter-
sections and a right at the third
one.
