Campus Police Force Disturbed

Over Proposed Name Change

The Universitys Campus Po-
lice force feel that the Universi-
ty administration is attempting
‘:0 take their power away.

Responding to a recent order. 

which they received recently. di-
recting them to remove the word
"Police“ from their shoulder
badges by Dec. 1 members of the
force are presently circulating pe-
titions around the campus pro-
testing the order and asking to
have it rescinded.

Klavonic Criticizes

Reportedly the badge would be
replaced by one saying "Secur-
ity.“ and many of the officers are
angered; feeling that the mandate
will.lessen their power in protect-
ing students; rob them of the re-
spect needed to deal with inci-
dences involving outsiders on
University property. and force
more intervention into campus in-
cidents by Pittsburgh City Police.

“lf Pitt were stashed on some
500 acre lot-—miles from any-

thing, I could see the ‘Security’
tag,” said Bert Netz_, campus po-
lice, union steward.

Netz said that the police title
was important. because the men
had to do so much patroling in the
University area on city streets.
thus coming into contact with a lot
of outside disturbances.

Washington Conference

by JUDY VOLLMER

Dr. Charles Montgomery. dean
of Student Development. and Len-
ny Klavonic. Student Government
president. attended the Second
Annual President to Presidents
Conference last weekend in Wash-
ington. D. C. University presi-
dents and student government
presidents from across the United
States met in Washington to dis-
cuss campus disorder. student in-
volvement in politics. and rela-
tions between students and ad-
ministrators.

Concerning the purpose of the
conference. Klavonic explained.
“We‘d hoped for a better under-
standing of what the people who
run this country feel about what
they're doing. The speakers. how-
ever. were evasive. sometimes
-iivoiding questions completely.
and sometimes answering ques-
tions that weren‘t asked." _

. —Melvin Laird. Secretary of De-

_ tense. spoke_ to the students. eti-

couraginig them to work legiti-

mately through the political sys-
tem. The students responded po-
litely. and there were no hints of
open disruption. But Klavonic ex-
plained that the students felt sup-
pressed by the press and new me-
dia covering the conference.

“Our silence and our applause
did not necessarily reflect ap-
proval of the Nixon administra-
tion. We were polite because we
too wanted to be heard. But I feel
that the media branded us as sup-
portive," he remarked.

Angry and disappointed with
the speakers‘ evasiveness. Klav-
onic and several other student
government presidents attempted
to organize "counter-conference."

"We felt that we were getting
the straight-Nixon line.“ Klavonic
added. “so we tried to call some
Democrats including Ted Kenne-
dy. George McGovern.-and Mark
Hatfield. but we ran out ofgtime
and .'.tlieir. sclieiiiiles i\\‘(‘l‘t‘ too
iiglu.“_ 1’ * 1

Klavonic also mentioned pro-
posal suggesting that several
youth advisory committees be set
up through cabinet departments.
The proposals will be officially
announced in November.

After talking with several stu-
dent government presidents from
across the country. Klavonic con-
cluded that Pitt is one of the most
progressive institutions in the na-
tion.

"Services such as abortion clin-
ics and legal advisory centers are
fairly rare and the credit-no/entry
system is virtually unknown. Pitt
seems to have fewer “apparent"
radicals and is more prepared to
offer assistance to the individual
than a lot of other schools in this
country.“

Klavonic concluded that he felt
that the students who attend the
conference cameaway with a bet-

.-ter understanding of how politi- ._
ciziiisLfunclioii and how they lian-g

Students React - .

BETSY FELDMAN received the bomb
threat by phone.

After the bomb scare was over
and the library has been reopened.
The Pitt News interviewed a num-
ber of students who had ventured
back inside the library.

The students‘ reactions were
varied. The majority of those
aware that there had been a threat
tended to laugh it off. One student
said. “It was exciting," and
then added sarcastically, “G0.
Panthers, go." Jack Mandel ob-
served that “it was done for no
purpose. Unless there was a rea-
son. it was a waste. I really hoped
the news would come so I could be
on TV."

Ellen Stenzel, a Pitt co-ed.

A bomb threat evacuated ‘Hill-P; '

Monday evening.

At approximately 6:50 pm,
Miss Betsy Feldman.‘ librarian
on the ground floor answered a
phone call. A young voice threat-
ened. “There's a bomb in the
building." Miss Feldman reacted,’
"You're kidding.“ and the caller
hung up.

She immediately notified Harry 

Shiedls. the checkout man, who.

told the Campus Police. Every- . 

one. except guards. evacuated im- ~

mediately.

Sergeant George Lancaster re-
ported that a thorough search was
made of every stack, box, and
wastebasket. “Every containep
that could have contained a bomb
was searched,” the Sergeant con-
firmed. P

No bomb was found. Students ‘ 1
were permitted to reenter the li- _ Z

brary at 8:05.

“It broke the boredom of the Pitt
campus. lt’s the most exciting
thing that’s happened since girls
stopped wearing bras.” —

Still others commented on the ~.

more serious side of the issue.
One student concerned about an
upcoming test said, “I‘m thor-
oughly annoyed because it inter-
fered with my studies. I have an
exam tomorrow." Another stu-
dent felt that “only perverted peo-
ple would do something like that.”

None of the students who were
interviewed connected the Pitt
bomb threat with the recent}
bombing at the University of Wis-

consin. They all felt it was just a s '

prank and that nothing as serious
as an actual bombing could occur‘
on the Pitt campus. »

The chant is often drowned out
by the incessant bells and drums
of the Krishna followers, who
have taken advantage of the
warm, Indian summer days to
spread their message to the Uni-
versity.

Previously, the Krishna proph-
ets stood outside Lawrence Hall,

, beating an almost day-long tatoo

in search of contributions and con-
formants. Informed that their
bells were disturbing studying
students, the Krishna people
moved their proselytizing base to
the Cathedral of Learning.

Godhead.”

Ken is 19 and joined the Krish-
na movement three months ago.
Since he was “frustrated by ma-
terial nature,” Ken began practic-
ing Hatha yoga and broke his ties
with the Catholic‘ Church. In his
“search for a guru,” Ken met a
group of Krishna people in New
York City and began attending a
temple there. After becoming a
disciple of the spiritual master,

Ken moved from his home in
Brooklyn and joined the farm
community in Moundsville.

In the fall of 1967. Richard
went to a Krishna temple in Los
Angeles for a free meal. He liked
the food, but didn‘t give the move-
ment much thought until he re-
turned to the temple two years
later for another handout. At-
tracted by the friendliness of the
people. Richard began attending
the temple once a week. Through
Krishna Richard became “less
concerned with material exis-
tence" and he and his wife de-
cided to join the Moundsville farm
community.

FALSE EGO
Ken and Richard explained that
their shaven heads and loose
skirts were methods of decreas-
ing concern with the physical

body. Richard pointed out that

“identification with the physical
is the false ego. Through Bhakti
(the ultimate yoga) you come to
the knowledge that the spiritual
ego is the true ego.“ ’

Student Help
Helps Students

by DANA VENTRIGLIA

Since April 6, 1970, the office
at 304 South Bouquet St. has had
over 1,000 visitors and the num-
ber is growing daily. The store-
front office houses the Student
Help Center of Pittsburgh, a rela-
tively new organization designed
to aid the people of Pittsburgh in
finding help.

An independent referral serv-
ice, the Help Center was created
by students of medicine, law and
social work. According to Ronald
Krall, a second year medical stu-
dent and the present chairman of
the Center, - “The Center was
founded on the idea that we as pro-
fessional students perceived a
gap between students and profes-
sional people of the community.
. . . People need help finding help.

The Center is based on the con-
cept that students of the profes-
sions are in a much better posi-
tion to aid young people who are
unable or unwilling to seek help
through regular channels. It aims
to break down the barriers be-
tween professionals and the peo-
ple they serve.

Krall mentioned that the prob-

lems encountered have ranged’
from unwanted pregnancies to dif- I

ficulties with housing. He stress-
ed the point that the Center’s prin-
cipal function was making refer-
rals, not counseling or diagnosis.
“We want to help somebody de-
fine his problem so that we can
correctly refer him,” Krall stat-
ed. “The trick is not to start do-
ing the counseling.”

Krall noted that his staff is now
in the process of reviewing what
has been done in the past “in an
attempt to gain more sensitivity

and knowledge and to improve our
ability to handle problems."

He is also planning to institute
drug discussion groups under the

' leadership of either a local psy-

chologist or a member of the
Community Health Center.

Individual problems at the Cen-
ter are dealt with on a one to one
basis, Krall pointed out, and no
names are taken. For future ref-
erences, files are kept according
tognumbers. “Most people come
in with serious problems,” Krall

‘ emphasized, “and we feel that

they ought to have somebody qual-
ified to handle them.”

‘Except for a part-time secre-
tary, the Center is staffed com-
pletely by volunteers. Seventy
staff members are students in
law, medicine, and social work,
with an additional 60 undergrad-
uate and high school volunteers.

Staff training, is a continuous
process at the Center. Groups of
staff members meet weekly with
trained social workers and psy-
chologists to discuss dealing with
clients and interviewing skills.

The Center, which is partially
founded by the Falk Medical
Foundation, the United Fund, and
the Student American Medical
Foundation, is open from noon un-
til 10 p.m. daily.

as a “sica.”

Although they recognize Christ
as the son of God, members of the
movement worship only “the Su-
preme Enjoyment, the Lord, Sri
Krishna.” The Krishna people
study the Bhagavad-gita which
was first spoken by Krishna.5,000
years ago. A. C. Bhaktivedanta

his life. the child is “spoiled" and
the parents give the child any-
thing he wants that “will not hurt
him or anyone else." Then the
child is put under the care of an
adult outside the immediate fami-
ly who strictly disciplines him
in the Krishna way of life until he
is 16. “This way." said Rich-
ard. "the child remains attached
to his real parents and is willing
to do what they ask of him."

shave their heads or change their
way of dress. A Krishna may be
an executive and maintain his ties
with the community, but his earn-
ings are used to “further~Krishna
consciousness——not for personal
gratification." Ken admitted that
the actions of Krishna disciples
"may appear to be materialistic,
but everything we do is for Krish-
na—to spread the love of God."

A0 Krishna temple is to be open-
ed at 5480 Penn Ave. Sunday, Oct.
4. Although they have not “reach-
ed total realization of spirit,
Aham Brahmasmi (I am spiritl,”
Ken and Richard claim that their
anxiety has decreased since they

became involved with the Krishn2( V’

movement.

“All that we ask,” they say, “is
that you try chanting Hare Krish-
na. Then everything else will be-
come sublime.”

The idea behind this campaign
is a reaffirmation of faith in
non-violent approaches for effect-
ing desired social change. YAF
believes that it is necessary to
restore an atmosphere of reason
to the academic community. re-
alizing that violence in the end
benefits no one.

Buttons will be distributed at
the booth on the Ground Floor
of the Cathedral on Tuesday and
Thursday. at the Activities Fair
on Tuesday. and in the Student
Union on Friday. If successful

the campaign may be extended
through next week.

midable occurrence at an institution of
higher learning. If this had been an isolated
incident. it might be possible to look upon
it as simply unfortunate before putting it
out of our minds.

But the event was not a unique one. just
more blatant than others.

Two years ago there was a movement
by non-ROTC students and faculty to re-
move credit from the ROTC program. Al-
though some ROTC critics were sincere,
others were simply intolerant of views dif-
ferent from their own. During the boycott
of classes, mourning the shootings at Kent
State this past summer, a number of the
boycotters verbally annoyed those stu-
dents who chose to exercise their rights to
continue to attend classes.

In each instance. we see different
groups of people harboring contrasting
ideas and divergent sets of values. The re-
sulting conflict would present a healthy
learning situation if it weren't for the lack
of receptivity involved. It is our privilege
to disagree. but it is nobody‘s right to de-
mand agreement or conformity.

Ideally. a university is a community of
scholars linked together by the search for
truth and knowledge. We bathe in ideas.
gingerly testing some. accepting and re-
jecting others.

Ideally, too, there is respect for the
ideas and opinions of others. At the lowest
rung of this idealistic ladder, there is at
least tolerance.

When we cease to be receptive. the pur-
pose of a university is defeated. When we
attempt to stop others from living and
working by their sets of values. the pur-
pose of “the American way of life" is de-
feated and one man's freedom. whether
academic or personal. becomes another
mans chains.

It might again be wise to ponder the
words oi lxiill; "If all mankind minus one
were of one opinion. mankind would be no
more justified in silencing that one person
than he. if he had the power. would be jus-
tified in silencing mankind.“

0/ 3715 Mind

by FRANK DONATELLI
Staff Columnist

In any society. there are certain funda-
mental principles on which the social fab-
ric rests. Often these principles become
embodied in certain key words. which none
dare question. Thus. rather than attack-
ing the words. an attempt is usually made
to so distort their meanings. that it be-
comes impossible to glean anything from
them.

In America today. the words "free-
dom" and "free society" are being sub-
jected to the process. No one can attack
“freedom" and still retain credibility. so
an effort is made to distort its meaning. ‘

While it is next to impossible to pro-
vide comprehensive definitions for these
important concepts, it is possible, indeed
it is imperative, for those who believe that
freedom is under attack, to offer some ob-
servations on freedom and the free society.

First. let us discuss what freedom is
not. Freedom is definitel_v not the "libera-
tion from want" that many talk about now-
adays. This line of argument confuses free-
dom with wealth. It is conceivable that one
might have access to all the luxuries life
can provide. and still be denied basic free-
dom of speech. religion. assembly. etc.

The great champions of liberty of the
18th and 19th centuries were the first to
develop a viable concept of freedom within
the social order. Freedom to them meant

the right of the individual to pursue his own '

uninhibited ends. provided. of course. that
the ends do not infringe on the rights of
others.

The individual had a right to his life,
and hence, everything that he could obtain
for himself without physically threatening
others. In this view, no one has an absolute
right to wealth, only the right to SEEK
wealth.

With this in mind. it becomes possible
to offer some ideas on "the free society”

and what constitutes it. Leonard Read of
the Foundation for Economic Education
offers a definition:

“The free society. as best I can define
it. is that state of affairs where there are
noman-concocted restraints against the
release of creative human energy.“

The free society seeks to enable indi-
viduals to pursue their ends within an or-
derly framework. After all, no freedom is
possible without order. A society which
preserves order by protecting its citizens
from domestic violence (the police), by
guarding against foreign invasion (the mili-
tary), and by administering justice (the
courts) while preserving individual free-
dom can be said to be “free.”

In her essay. The Nature of Govern-
ment, Ayn Rand describes a society which
falls in these functions:

A society that robs an individual of his
effort, or enslaves him, or attempts to limit
the freedom of his mind, or compels him to
act against his own rational iudgment—a
society that sets up a conflict between its
edicts and the requirements of man's na-
ture—is not, strictly speaking, a society, but
a mob held together by institutionalized
gang-rule. Such a society destroys all the
values of human co-existence, has no pos-
sible iustification, and represents, not a
source of benefits, but the deadliest‘ threat
to man's survival. Life on a desert island is
safer than and incomparable preferable to
existence in Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.

The twin engines of freedom—liberal
democracy and the free market economy-
have given us so much that. taking contin-
ual progress for granted. we forget how
progress was achieved in the first place.

In our zeal for “equalit_v" or "justicez"
we are strangling the lifeline whereby
these goals can be best achieved. namely

freedom.

Should we continue along this disas-
trous path. we may yet have a Caesar in
our time.

Leonard Weinglass. co-coun-
selor at the Chicago Conspiracy
Trial. is not only an attorney;
he is an educator. a teacher.
Last .\Ionday night his class-
room was the Intercultural

Following his
debate at the 
Student Union.
Weinglass ac-
cepted an invi-
tation to stay at
the House. This
afforded the ICH

in touch with movement strug-
gles around the country and was
able to provide information we
just can't get in the local “press."

It is very fitting that this dis-
cussion take place at the ICH.
Most importantly, it turned sev-
eral people on to the fact that the
House even exists.

The ICH was founded last Jan-
uary as a self-governing inter-
racial living unit. It is 20 stu-
dents. black. white. and foreign.

solve their own problems and per-
haps shed some light on the prob-
lems that confront us all. A

the other members profit from
his experiences.

It is the intent of the members,
as well as the founders‘, that the
ICH serve as a forum for dis-
cussion of social and political is-
sues outside the classroom. That
Monday night the ICH was just
that. Hopefully there will be more
nights like that one.

But it doesn‘t take a Leonard
Weinglass to learn from. As the
members of the House have found
from their experiences there. you
can learn’ a lot from just talking

To the Editor. The Pitt News:

It was all summed up quite well
by that astute person who blam-

thing that is wrong today. Col-

are the ones. who in the thirties.

They now hold American educa-

That might be a lot for parents.
who shell out thousands of dollars
to educate their kids. to believe.
All I can say is that you have to
see it to believe it. If parents
would drop into classes at random
for a month or so they would be
horrified. To save them all that
time I will briefly give the
straight stuff.

Contemporary History courses
are without deviation taught from
an explicit Marxist framework.

To the Editor. The Pitt News:

Our campus security patrol is
circulating a petition which would
change their title from the Uni-
versity Security Services to the
University of Pittsburgh Police.
This may seem like a trivial point
but to them it is a matter of pride
and prestige. Their present title

well-equipped and smoothly oper-
ating unit. What we are fortunate
to have is a closely knit group of
men who will not judge you as a
city policemen would: guilty or
not guilty. In their 16 years of
patroling the campus area. pro-
tecting life and property. and ren-
dering service. they have learned
that applying a person to person
relationship works best in pro-
moting good will.

A new system has been initiat-
ed at our campus this year. On
Friday and Saturday evenings.
University police patrol the
streets in the area to protect the
students. faculty. and staff from
the Oakland gangs. Last year.
some 90 students were attacked.

Up to date there have been none.
The officers believe that changing
their title would act as a preven-
tive measure. The gangs in the
area believe that our police do not
have any authority off campus.
This is a misconception. If they
were referred to as policemen.
outsiders might think of them as

Perhaps the title of University

will remain. But why not show
that you appreciate the job they

Y “Discovers” Encounter

by POHLA SMITH

We are the hollow men

We are the stuffed men

Leaning together

Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!

--from The Hollow Men
T. 5. Eliot

Advertisments announcing the
YMCA's Project Discovery begin
in this way.

Project Discovery is a program
designed to help individual mem-
bers and organizations of the Uni-
versity lose their feelings of al-

ienation and hollowness that de-

velop on a large campus. It seeks
to allow people to express them-

selves as individuals and to help

them communicate with others
through conversation. encounters.
and artistic expression.

The Get—Together Luncheons.
held every Tuesday at noon in the

I’ back of Schenley Cafeteria. are
 another aspect of Project Dis-

covery. "The luncheons were de-
signed." Miss Aligexplained. “for
people who want to talk about
ideas. who want to meet and talk
to other people."

The YMCA is holding half-day
and day-long microlabs where
facilitators will help people ex-
plore, experience, and express
their feelings in certain areas. A
Body Awareness microlab, for
example, will help people learn to
express their feelings to others
through non-verbal communica-
tion. Other labs will be conduct-
ed in such areas as Sexual Feel-
ings, On Being a Woman, and On
Being a Man. People interested in
attending should register with the
YMCA at least five days in ad-

,vance.

A major phase of Project Dis-
covery is weekend encounter ses-
sions where small groups of peo-
ple will explore themselves and
seek communication. under the
superivision of a facilitator. The

-sessions will be held at various

camps and will cost between $15
and $20.

A new feature of Project Dis-
covery is the Creative Consulting
Service. Troubled groups can call

 Joseph Blasi. facilitator. at the

YMCA. who will send a profes-
sional consultant to help the
groups solve their problems or to
communicate better.

Karen “Angle” Albig, co-director
of Project Discovery, expressed
hope that the program “will cre-

ate the opportunity for people to
come and talk about problems, re-
late to each other, hand loose, to
express how they feel, and to
talk.’’

"Angle" explained that the
YMCA developed the program be-
cause the University is too for-
mal. “We wanted a program
where you could let down your
status and be a person.“ she said.
She feels Project Discovery af-
fords the opportunity for profes-
sors and students to talk as just
“people.”

One phase of the Program in-
cludes a series of festivals of
awareness. Karen. who is in
charge of this phase. explained
that it will be composed of Art
Happenings and Guerilla The-
aters. She defined Art Happen-
ings as festivals in a large room
of the Student Union where peo-

ple will be able to “come in and
do their own thing with art.
Though some supplies will be
available. ;‘Angle" encourages
people to bring their own supplies
with them.

Guerilla Theaters are describ-
ed as brief two to‘ five minute
plays designed to express human
conditions. One such play was
held on the Cathedral lawn sever-
al weeks ago. The play portrayed
the plight of an alienated student
crying for someone to talk to.
Only one little girl stopped to help
him. Karen said that the play
made quite an impression on the
impromptu audience.

are usually non-students." he
went on. "and we are here to pro-
tect the students so we must pa-
trol these streets."

He commented that the word
“Security” did not denote the type
of power an officer needed to deal
with situations on the city streets.
“I’ve seen it happen at other
places,” Netz continued, “and
people don’t even want to ask a se-
curity officer directions.”

One officer. Ed Pendergast
commented that he thought the
prestige should go with the cam-
pus officer‘s job saying. “We are
commissioned police officers. and
this order is lowering the men‘s
morale."

But the major concern of the
men is that stripping them of the
police title will “give the Oakland
hoodlums something to play on."
as Pendergast put it.

In relation to this point, Netz
pointed to a fight last Friday at

the corner of Forbes Ave. and
Bouquet St., in which he said cam-
pus police, moving in to quell a
disturbance involving students
and non-students, “had rocks and
bottles thrown at them and were
jumped.

"Were not going to buy this se-
curity guard stuff.“ Netz warned.
"and still be expected to do the
same work.“

He cautioned that the change in
the force could ultimately result
in the city police having to be call-
ed onto campus more frequently;

even to deal with totally student ,
disturbances. “They don't care or 3

understand students like we do."
he said.

Netz concluded by warning that
the campus and the community
surrounding the campus would
eventually lose all respect for the
campus police if the regulation
were not rescinded and that “the
men just won‘t go down on the city
streets as security guards."

JERRY RICHEY
In Final Year

Midway through the fourth quarter of Saturdays
Pitt-Baylor game. 230 pound fullback Tony Es-
posito had a peculiear view of the playing field; he

was flat on his back.

by MARTY HELLMAN

The road to a possible lC4A
championship for this years
cross country team begins today
at Cleveland State University.

This afternoons match against
the Vikings will be the first com-
petition for Coach Jim Banners
harriers this season. ’

Between today and Nov. 16.
when the Eastern crown will be
decided. the squad has only four
other meets. However. the out-
come of any of these meets will
not have any bearing upon the har-
riers eligibility for the IC4A's.

With everyone returning from
last season’s squad which posted
a 7-1 record, plus the addition
of transfer Mike Schurko, the po-
tential of another good season
looms strong.

Leading the runners against
Cleveland State will be two-time
All-American Jerry Richey. Rich-

 Iioad To IC4A’sBe

ey. who has been top man on the
squad in the past two seasons.
currently possesses all of Pitts‘
cross country records.

Complimenting Richey and
Schurko will be several excellent
runners. For Mark Vornhagen.
Mike Nolan. and Greg Rodgers.
this will be the final campaign
in what have been outstanding col-
lege careers.

In addition to those five sen-
iors, Banner can count ‘on Dave
Szabat, Dave Cheseborough and
Bob Hagner.

"All of the boys have done ex-
cellent in training." Banner said.
"Everyone has been a pleasant
surprise to me.“

Cleveland State has a predom-
inately young team. Both of last
year's top runners. Felix Rendia
and Brady Dean are sophomores.
Three of the other four return-
ing lettermen are sophomores and

  

posito said, “We were pretty sure we could do 

though.”

The ‘changeover
grass at Baylor did have an affect on the hard run-

from AstroTurf to regular

ning ballcarrier from Pitt.

 

Tony was helped off the field. after being visa-
bly shaken by a Baylor defensive back. Phil Sgrig-
noli replaced him and did a fine job. When asked

' how he felt on Monday. three days later. Esposito

remarked that he "has a head-ache."

Other than that the bib 61‘ senior from Mc-

Kees Rocks is in top shape. His 91 yards-in Satur-

- days game against the

Bears pushes his total

to 154 yards this sea-

son. good for a tough
4.0 yards per carry.

Esposito holds the
distinction of being
Pitt’s top running back
-since 1952. He com-
piled a total of 743
yards last season,
grinding out his game
high of 168 against Tu-
lane. The big fullback
is still looking for his
first 100-yard game this

TONY ESPOSITO
this year but is confident he has a big sea son ahead.

Saturdays game against Baylor was a little
frustrating for Esposito. Pitt managed to move the
ball well all during the first half but was halted deep
inside Baylor territory.

“It gets pretty discouraging during the game."
the fullback commented. “You take the ball 50. 60

yards and then get stopped."

The discouragement did not lead to dispair. Es-

"We had some trouble with the turf. Esposito
commented. "at least I did. We just weren't used to
it." The squad is on the artificial grass again this

- week at home against Kent State. so things should

be back to normal.

Esposito is a graduate of Stowe High School
where he was all-section. all-WPIAL and all-state.
He then went to Greenbrier Military Academy for
one year before he came to Pitt. At Greenbrier.
Tony was named all-league.

Last year for Pitt, the McKees Rocks native
was named honorable mention for the all-east squad ‘
and twice he was voted onto the weekly ECAC
teams. ’

Majoring in Economics. Esposito has no definite.
plans after graduation. But he wants to stay in the
sports world and states. “I‘m gonna play ball if I
get a chance." 4

The other half of Espositos double threat has
not been tapped yet this year. Tony caught ten pass-
es last year for 84 yards and two touchdowns. He
hasn‘t caught a pass. but the opposing team can't
afford to ignore the possibility.

* * *

The Panthers rolled up a total of 207 yards
on the ground Saturday against Baylor which is
respectable tally for anygteam. Esposito. who rum-
bled for 91 of those yards gives a lot of credit to the
offensive line. Tony remarked. “They‘re doing a
real good job." going on to cite how effectively they
wore down the Baylor defensive line. culminating in
two touchdown drives in the fourth quarter.

The biggest threat to Banner’s
squad, however, will be a fresh-
man. Ed Gattus, who ran a 9:36.7

missed. I could have shot and blew it. but Ifelt that it was not worthi_t..- ‘g .; ;.

so I passed it." he said.

Gus missed some shots in the
booters’ match with West Ches-
ter on Saturday. Even though he
was able to move the ball past the
defenders, he failed to shoot. He
blamed this on his unfamiliarity
with the stadium AstroTurf. He
feels, however, that when the
team becomes experienced with
the artificial grass the visiting
teams will be put at a disadvan-
tage.

Gus is still in the action. even
when he is not on the field.

“Even if I don't play I feel that
I‘m part of it. I feel that I repre-
sent the team."

Theofilos has high hopes for the
squad this year.

"Were going places this year."
he says. “We have a great coach.
he listens to everybody. After the
match Saturday I felt so happy
because he was happy. Some of
the guys disagree with him be-
cause they feel they should be
playing and aren‘t. but you can‘t
be that way. “

Gus has been playing soccer
since he was four years old. Be-
fore coming to this country three
years ago from‘ Greece. he play-
ed on a professional teams.

Sometimes, however, this ex-
perience leads to conflicts with
other players.

"Sometimes I have trouble with
kids here because they don't un-
derstand my playing."

The conflicts are easily settled.
Gus can’t stay mad at a team-.
mate for very long.

Today, he‘ feels is the big test
for the team when they go against
Bucknell.

"If we don't beat Bucknell we
can forget it. That‘ is the whole
season.“" _‘ . f

""'Gi°i¢Iilci's. That Is
Kent Staters
Unheard Of?

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Many people claim that they had never heard of Kent State Univer-
sity before the disruptions that resulted in four deaths on the campus
last May 4. With week's point spreads out. it seems like quite a few
people in the sports world haven't heard about the Ohio School.

Carl DePasqua‘s Pitt football team play Kent's Golden Flashes
Saturday at Pitt Stadium. and the Panthers are so heavily favored that
odds aren't listed. That usually means the favored team is supposed to
to win by at .
least t h r e e
to u c h d o w n s.
likely. more.

That‘s quite a
predicted edge
for the Pan-
thers. even if
th e game is
against a school 
whose protes- STEVE PETRO
tors are better known than its
athletes.

Pitt assistant coach Steve Pe-

 

Few people expect the Pan-
thers to be thrashed Saturday. in-
cluding the Kent people. The Ohio
crowd is now telling everyone
that their players fear the Stadi-
um‘s AstroTurf. something most
of them have never seen.

The Flashes maybe glad to get
away from their home field for
the first time this season, though.
Playing their first two games at
home hasn’t been all fun.

Last week they were booed by

Women Netters

C-MU On Home

Pitt‘s tennis team stormed C—MU Monday in more ways than
one. The combination of freezing weather. rain. tennis balls that
were invisible. a default. and a long. four matches leading to a 5-0
loss really had the Tartans worn out.

It was Pitt's second victory over C—MU and the team's fourth

Storm ‘
Courts

straight win of the season.

Eileen Surdoval played the
number one position and defeat-
ed Peggy Johnson. C-MU's top
player. 7-5. 6-2. "I didn‘t use
any strategy. There wasn‘t that
much of a threat." commented
Eileen.

Her opponent played net much
of the match. and Eileen's use of
the lob earned her quite a few
points.

The Women‘s Varsity Field
Hockey Team will play Chatham
at 4:30 P.M. at Trees Field. ac-
ross from Pitt Stadium. Chatham
is scouted to be powerful. both

CMU’s Mo Inove requested
new balls in the number two
singles match. She couldn’t see
the ball. Whether it was the
cloudy weather or Elaine Kingas’
hitting, still hasn’t been deter-
mined. Elaine, who plays deep
most of the match, won 6-3, 6-1.

In the number three singles
Joann Kotjan of Pitt defeated Di-
ane Remin 8-6. 6-0. “We were
evenly matched.“ stated Joann.
"There were alot of volleys. and
since the game went so slowly I
had a lot of time to .lace the
ball." Pitt's coach. Dr. “Goldie"
Edwards described the match
as having a lot of top shots.

The first doubles match was

Eileen Surdoval, no. one

“C-MU had all they could
do to get the ball over the net."
remarked Maxine. "It was an
easy. relaxed game." Laura add-
ed. “The game was on the ag-
gressive side. We had a chance
to place the ball more."

The C-MU coach refused to
comment on the matches. Dr. Ed-

 

tro has seen the Flashes’ grid
people, having scouted their first
two games, and he isn't accepting
a victory‘ before Kent (1-1) ar-
rives in town.

"They're in an enviable posi-
tion.“ Petro said. “They can let
all stops out and go for a win.

"Were not scared of ‘em. If
we hit back properly were gonna
have an easy time of it. but if we
don't . . 

It would seem. highly unlikely
that the Panthers wouldn’t hit
back properly in the game. Kent
State, not yet big time football
doesn’t approach the Panthers
physical size by a long shot.

The only thing the Flashes
seem to say they have going for
themselves is a desire to build a
reputation for their conference.
the Mid-American Conference.

Kent’s coach Dave Puddington
says. “We're coming down to rep-

‘resent the Mid-American Confer-

ence." and the sports informa-
tion director. Paul Schlemmer
adds. "It would be a boom to the
conference if we could beat Pitt.
Every once in a while somebody
from our conference sneaks into
camp and beats somebody."

Prestige for the conference
doesn’t seem like the major in-
gredient needed to win a football
game, but if that’s all the Flashes
have it's enough to keep the al-
ways leary Carl DePasqua on
guard.

"Nobody overlooks anybody be-
cause you prepare everyday for
the game." he said. "But some-
times I have seen practices where
you look like you‘re ready. You
have the testimonials on Friday.
and you get the hell beaten out of
you in the game.“
