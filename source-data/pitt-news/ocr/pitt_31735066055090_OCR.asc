Irish eyes were smiling this weekend at
the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade in
downtown Pittsburgh. Leading the parade
was the 1996 Miss Smiling Irish Eyes,
Kelly Morris.

Morris, a junior communications major at
Pitt, belongs to the Ladies Ancient Order of
Hibemians, a prominent organization in the
Irish community. Through LAOH, she was
able to submit an essay that ultimately led

her to be chosen by the parade comlrnittee
to be Miss Smiling Irish Eyes.

“I wrote an essay about my life, why I am
proud of my‘ Irish heritage and why it is
important for everyone to know about their
own heritage,” she said.

She was crowned at the courthouse
Thursday by Allegheny County
Commissioner Larry Dunn. Following the
crowning, she and her court, Kera Brodrick,
also a Pitt student, and Erin Caldwell from
Pleasant Hills, were presented to Mayor
Tom Murphy, a fellow Irishman.

Morris had appeared on the parade court
before — during the blizzard of ‘93.
Refusing to give up the Irish tradition, she

., trudged her way from the Civic Arena to

:7‘  V , the Hyatt Hotel in over a foot of snow. Her

' ‘  involvment in the ‘93 parade enabled her

family to take part in the LAOH and the

March is ‘honored nationally as her-

country are seizing the chance to tell

Women at Pitt are paying tribute to
their heritage in a number of events
marked for the month, including a
three-day annual event which
spanned the weekend.

“Gender and Development Beyond
Beijing: Exploring Local and

topic of the Fourth Annual Women in

about gender issues in the field of
sociopolitical and economic develop-
ment.

The Women in Development
Committee, a multi—disciplinary
group of students in the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs, along with a handful of other
students at Pitt, organized the event
to help contribute to the process
whereby the role of women in devel-
opment is recognized and valued and
to change the approach so that it can
be more inclusive to women.

“Women in development is a catch-
all term,” said Victoria Stanley, a

development is often overlooked, and
that’s what the group and the confer-

change that by highlighting their
roles and by trying to get more
women involved.”

President quits offer
six years at CMU

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Carnegie Mellon University
has joined Pitt in being leader-
less.

CMU President Robert
Mehrabian resigned his post on
Friday after six years to be with
his wife and ailing mother-in-law
in California. Mehrabian’s depar-
ture comes just four months after
the school’s board of trustees
rewarded him with a new con-
tract and as the school continues
its climb in national reputation.

Mehrabian, 54, said he will
stay at CMU until a successor is
named, which, according to the
school’s trustees, could take up to
a year. .

School endowments have
nearly doubled to $500 million
in Mehrabian’s term, and the
school is in the middle of build-
ing a $47 million student union
about a mile down from Pitt’s on
Fifth Avenue.

CMU has also consistently
been ranked nationally in engi-
neering programs for undergrad-
uate and graduate students. And
along with those programs,

CMU has seen a steady rise in its
applications for enrollment under
Mehrabian.

Mehrabian came to CMU after
serving as the dean of college of
engineering at the University of
California at Santa Barbara. He
also taught at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and at
the University of Illinois at
Urbana before joining CMU in
1990.

While CMU is just beginning
a search for a new president, Pitt
is in the heart of its search for a
new chancellor to replace J.
Dennis O’Connor, who resigned
last April.

Chancellor Search Committee
Chairperson James Roddey told
the Faculty Assembly last week
that the committee has narrowed
the search to 10 candidates. He
said in last week’s University
Times that the list has some “real
stars,” including several current
university presidents.

Roddey said the committee
intends to have four ﬁnalists by
early May, and they will come to
Pitt so they can be evaluated by
groups of students, faculty, staff,
administrators and trustees.

ing it easier for women to establish

The weekend event covered a
variety of issues dealing with
women in development, including
implementation and evaluation,
and participatory workshops pre-
sented the opportunity to network
and learn about building power by
taking charge of the resources

Saturday afternoon, many women
spoke about their personal experi-
ences of getting out into the world
and making a change through
grass-root efforts or through gov-
ernmental involvement. Estella
Bello Soto spoke first-hand about
her experiences with environmen-
tal education campaigns and the
recycling center in Mexico and
Marcelina White, from GSPIA at
Pitt, discussed feminists and the

war Salvador.

“It’s women pulling together in
order to celebrate achievements
and work towards future goals,”
says Stanley.

The conference most effectively
pointed out that despite past and
even the most recent efforts of
many women and men, including
the National Women’s Conference
in Beijing, it’s a fact that women
still don’t get equal pay for equal

men when it comes to’ the decision-
making process in governmental
actions.

If that is going to change,
according to many of the confer-
ence speakers, women must make
the changes, and the conference is
merely a tool to learn of other’s
achievements and to kickstart
future efforts.

Many women involved in the
conference stress that this only a

Opinions
Gas is cheaper than repair

Citizens of Pennsylvania, we now have something else to
whine about. Governor Ridge has proposed a 6.5 percent
increase in the state’s gasoline tax. That means gas prices will
be even higher than they are now, and driving in Pennsylvania
will be even more expensive than it already is.

What this also means is that, if the tax is passed, the state
will be able to pay for the damage caused by bad weather this
year. It means the state will be able to afford to fix roads and
bridges that have needed it for a while. Ask anyone who dri-
ves through Pennsylvania into virtually any other state, and

they will tell you that Pennsylvania’s road maintenance is

among the poorest theyhave ever seen.

But opponents of the gas tax prefer to complain about the
bad road conditions instead of paying more for gas, even
though (according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, March 17)
gas would still be cheaper than it was last summer when
prices were skyrocketing.

We have become spoiled by the low prices of gasoline in
the past few years. Twenty years ago, a gallon of gas was con-
siderably more expensive (considering inflation) than it is
today. The proposed increase would only raise the average
family’s annual gas—experiditure from $800 to $841.

If you are so opposed tothe increase ‘in gas prices that
would help fix the _roads, then wait until one of our infamous
potholes becomes a sinkhole. Once your car is wrecked, you
might not be so against spending $41 to make driving easier
and safer.

Stop busing, start teaching

The city of Pittsburgh is currently considering plans to redi-

. vide the school districts. Hopefully, the plan will end the bus-

ing of children from one end of the city to the other. Busing

, was established in order to desegregate public schools. But

now the issue is not just about segregation.

Opponents of the city’s plan to end busing say that this plan
will re-segregate Pittsburgh’s city schools. But according to
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (March 16), “the percentage of
district students attending racially balanced schools would
drop from 58 percent to 45 percent” if busing stops. In other
words, busing was never a magical cure-all for segregation.

Opponents also fear that children who live in poorer neigh-
borhoods will not have the same educational opportunities
that they would have if they were bused to a wealthier school.
Here they have a legitimate argument. The problem, however,
lies deeper than the racial and economic make-up of any
given school district. The heart of this problem lies within the
city’s education system. Instead of busing children to another
district to get a better education, the city should be spending
its money to improve the education in the lower-income dis-
tricts.

Israel and the peace process

I am an active senior mem-
ber of» I Habonim Dror
International, a Labor Zionist
organization supporting the
Israeli peace process. Who are
the Labor Zionists? What do
we do?

The Labor Zionists are liber-
al, die-hard supporters of
Israel.,They believe the only
way to achieve peace between

Israel and Palestine is by giv-

ing the Palestinians the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip. The
recent Hamas terrorist attacks
in Israel have borne in the pop-
ulace a lack of confidence in
the Labor Zionists running the
Israeli parliament. With May
elections coming up, the Likud
party is threatening to put an
end to the Labor party’s domi-
nance in the Knesset. The
Likud party will try to comfort
a disconcerted populace by ter-
minating the peace process. It
is imperative for Israelis to
understand that putting an end
to the peace process and taking
away land from the PLO will
not appease militant aggres-
sors, but rather will ferment
their anger more.

The only way Israel can
progress is by continuing down
the rocky road to peace.
Likud’s draconian policy agen-
da calls for retreating, a pro-
posal which would usher in an
era of terrorist attacks unprece-
dented in modern Israeli histo-
ry. A desperate war would
erupt betweenradical, left-
wing Israelis and extremist
Palestinians, Lebanese, and
Syrians. There would be no
peace — only chaos and

‘ despair. Likud’s reforms are

uncivil, unethical and immoral
ways in which to try to elimi-
nate the terrorist threat. In
order to continue the peace
process and thus assure a rela-
tive state of non-belligerency
in the Middle East, we in the
diaspora must support the
Labor Zionist movement.
Yitzhak.Rabin was a Labor
Zionist. Shimon Peres is a

, Labor Zionist. The Knesset

Daniel
Weiss

majority is Labor Zionist, and
alternatively, the current
Middle East peace process is
reﬂective of the Labor Zionist
peace strategy. Zionist ideolo-
gy calls for a two-state peace
resolution which allows for a
self-governing, autonomous
Palestinian territory and a larg-
er Israeli state. We had nearly
fulfilled this goal when Hamas"
attempted to put a stay on the
peace process with a little coer-
cive lobbying. Likud’s princi-
pal ideology centers on a sepa-
rate peace which denounces an
autonomous Palestinian state.
One can be certain that if
elections yield to a new Likud

majority, than the progressive-

peace charters we have signed
or are legislating with our Arab
neighbors will be repealed or
vetoed. In effect, the peace
process as we know it will
become null and void, put on
an indefinite hold. The new
Likud majority would coer-
cively rebuild an Israeli state
comprised of both Palestinian
and Israeli territory. Diplomacy
would cease to continue with
Syria and Lebanon. Peace with
Palestine, Lebanon and Syria
would be no more.

Underthe current peace
process Israel is giving exten-
sive territory to the PLO.
Nevertheless, Hamas has car-
ried on its evil quest for
absolute control. Now, imagine
if a conservative, anti-peace
Likud-run Knesset dictated
Israeli policy. What do you
think would happen? Would
Hamas curtail or increase its
kamikaze runs? Would Israelis
become divided or bonded?
Would a belligerent Israel con-
tinue to receive international
support and funding? Would

neighboring Middle Eastern ’

countries look upon’ a repeal of

t the Palestinian territories with
passive indiffererltze? How.

would Palestinians react to a
single state resolution? Would

Israelis targeted by Lebanese
Katusha missiles praise the
work of Likud? Would Israelis
and Arabs targeted by increas-
ingly devastating terrorist
attacks support Likud? Would
the solidarity of the Israeli peo-
ple and the improving relation-
ship with our Arab neighbors
hold steadfast under Likud
reform? You decide. _
A‘ Likud member might
argue that the PLO covenant
and Islam’s Koran argue for
the destruction of the state of
Israel. He might argue that
Arafat’s praise of terrorists as
“martyrs,” his call for a jihad
and a foreign ministry in
Jerusalem, his quick release of
arrested terrorists and his cen-
sorship of the press prove that
a peaceful solution is not ratio-

nal, that we are dealing with a .

racist, uncompromising nation-
al entity dedicated to the

destruction of Israel. But are. I

we really? Should Yasar Arafat
and the PLO really be personi-
fied in such a discriminatory
hostile light?

For the moment, the answer

_ to that is no. The PLO’s con-

tractual aggressions cannot be
considered threats to an Israeli
state as long as Yasar Arafat is
dependent on foreign aid from
Israel, America and other offi-
cers in the democratic police
force. Additionally, until such
time as Israel is not protected
under the umbrella of the U.S.
military, the PLO cannot be
considered a threat to the peace
process. If Likud takes power
next year, the PLO will seize
the opportunity to fulfill its his-
torical obligation of seizing all
Israel in the name of Palestine.
Support and funds for two
aggressively extremist states
will evaporate. The peace
process will become an extinct
entity, and along with it will go
a rare era of Arab-Israeli

I accord.

So I summoned a round-table
discussion with a couple of my
closest cronies to get the inside

March Madness.

" Shakespeare, Alf, Dionne

After Alf arrived fashionably
late, it was time to take care of

any longer.

Mr. T: Those Memphis fools.
Theyare so talented, how could

totally killed me. I had them in
the Final Four.

Panthers
unbeaten
of home

By Kevin Lilley
Stajj‘Wn'ter

Fresh from a successful spring
break in Florida, the Pitt baseball
team brought its winning ways
home, taking four games in four
days from three different local
opponents.

' The action began with an 8-5
victory over Duquesne Thursday
afternoon, in a makeup of
Wednesday’s rainout. The
Panthers swept a doubleheader
from Slippery Rock on Saturday
with 4-2 and 2-1 victories and
ended the weekend run with a 7-
2.victory over Davis and Elkins
this past Sunday.

Head Coach Mark Jackson,
whose 150th victory came with
the first game of Saturday’s dou-
bleheader, praised his pitching
staﬁ for the victories.

‘‘We’re trying to switch up
looks,” said the coach, who

hoped that the different looks of S

Pitt’s staff would make it “hard
for the other team to get adjust-
ed”

Duquesne, the team’s only
Division I opponent of the home
set, gave J ackson’s staff the most
trouble, scoring ﬁve runs in Pitt’s
Trees Field homecoming. The

. Duke’s production came at the
expense of lefty Mike Rohrbach,

who allowed ﬁve runs, including
four home runs, in 4 2/3 innings
of work. Despite getting touched
up, Rohrbach earned the victory.
Pitt’s offensive production,
including a three—run home run
by Jason Conti, overcame the
early pitching troubles by torch-
ing Duquesne for eight runs in
the first six innings. Jason

Rakaczewski, a hard—throwing
right—hander, pitched three score-
less innings to earn the save.

“We have a number of guys
that can throw,” said Jackson of
his staff. Jackson also stated that
he would “try to get guys out
quickly” to keep the opposition
guessing. Jason Hoppa got a taste
of Jackson’s method early, as he

was removed early in the second
inning after giving up only two
hits and two walks. _

Robyn Senior ﬂips over the vault.

Every time a Pitt gymnast reaches for
the upper bar on the uneven bars, it. is
with the goal of completing a clean pro-

3; gram. The team goal has been to hit 24
 programs clean, because it knows that
 clean programs would earn enough
 points to break 190. Last Saturday, in a
I meet at the University of Maryland, the

Panthers set a school record and met their
goal. Beating IUP, 177.6, and for the sec-
ond time this season, James Madison

3 University, 189.925, Pitt came in second,

190.575 to Maryland’s 193.3.
“It took a lot of work, but we put it

= together,” said freshman Erika Flamer.

Pitt joined Maryland in setting a team

‘ record, but Maryland took most of the '

top placements. Pitt gymnasts did win the
vault and set a season—best score‘ of 48.1.
Michaelene Meyers and Flamer tied for
ﬁrst with 9.75, and Robyn Senior tied for
thirdpwith a score of 9.7.

At Maryland, Flamer’s performances
announced her role as a major competi-
tor. ‘

“She ﬂipped one [a vault] in warm-ups
that popped my eyes out,” said Head
Coach Debbie Yohman. So she told
Flamer to attempt two handspring front
pikes. Most Panthers execute a hand-

. spring front tuck that merits a starting

score of 9.9. Then the judges deduct any
mistakes from the starting points.

’“ Flamer’s vault carries a starting score of
raphe1'10_

“We’ve been training this all year for

the end of the season  everyone stood
up enough vaults to let me take a
chance,” said Flamer. “Tracey Brown
scored a personal best 9.45, so I did my
personal best.”

The vault, along with her other events,
helped Flamer set a personal best all-
around score, 38.225.

“It was the first time she topped 38 for
us,” said Yohman. Junior Robyn Senior
tied her personal best of 38.375, and
Brenda Stevens eamed 38.2.

The Panthers’ other placement came
on the beam, where Michaelene Myers
showed off her consistent tumbling, eam
ing a 9.775 and third place. ‘

“She did this with very limited practice
time,” said Yohman. Myers is recovering
from a heal injury which made it difficult
to practice.

“We had four good events that was in
spite of a hard ﬂoor,” said Yohman. “We
had to make some changes in tumbling
and water them down.”

Injuries did, however, force Yohman to
make a substitution in the team’s line-up.

Yohman thought sophomore Calli
Bodnar was in too much pain to compete,
so she placed Joy McElhinny, who hasn’t
competed ﬂoor all year, into the line-up.

In addition to Bodnar, who has com-
partmental stress syndrome, Michelle
Moore has ankle problems, and Lori
Buck is still recovering from an injury.

“We were five minutes into the warm
up before I said, ‘Joy warm up,”’ said
Yohman. “She [McE1hinny] did a super
job of starting the meet off.”

Shaffer set the tone with two strikeouts in a 1-2-3
ﬁrst inning. Shaffer did not allow a hit until Slippery
Rock shortstop Eric Maul’s single in the second but
escaped any damage thanks to a leaping grab by
Conti to rob SR’s Brian Burg of a run-scoring dou-
ble. ‘

The teams traded runs in the third, and Slippery
Rock’s Christian Conte drove an «RBI double into the
left-centerﬁeld gaphin the ﬁfth to give his squad a 2-1
lead Rakaczewski came in to stop the bleeding and

, kept Slippery Rock off the board for the rest of the

game.

Pitt’s half of the ﬁfth inning started with a hit bats-
man, a walk and a bunt single by Conti, which
loaded the bases without a hit reaching the outﬁeld.
All three runners eventually scored, thanks to an
error, a Rob Garvey walk and catcher Bill Derr’s run-
sconng f1elder’s choice. Only a ﬂyout by left ﬁelder
Kurt Womelsdorf cleared the infield grass in the
inning, but the scoring was enough to give Pitt the
victory. .

Rakaczewski earned the victory for his two score-
less innings of work, while Slippery Rock’s Steve
Urda got the loss. Pitt’s Carl Vollmer nailed down the
victory, striking out Nate Thimons for the last out of
the seventh. Both games went only seven innings
due to the doubleheader scheduling.

“Offensively, we’re just not playing up to our capa-
bilities,” said Jackson, whose squad managed fewer
runs in the doubleheader than in either of the other
two weekend games. “We have a number of guys
who are capable of hittingbetter than what they’re
hitting.” - I V

Game two of the doubleheader brought more
offensive trouble. Slippery Rock pitcher Jim Falbo
limited the Panthers to one run through his six
innings of work, holding Pitt to ﬁve hits on the after-
noon. Pitt pitching kept the game knotted at one,
however, Ken Gallentine’s solo blast over the left
ﬁeld fence accounted for Slippery Rock’s only scor-
mg.

In the seventh, Falbo recorded only one out before
granting Conti and Womelsdorf free passes, leading
to his exit. Chris Wright took over and promptly hit
Garvey to load the bases. Guy Sisto, Pitt’s third base-

two runs on only one hit — a bunt single by Lou

ward, getting home runs from Conti and Joe Carter in
the late frames to ensure the win.

“We’d rather play Divisionil,” said Jackson of his
team’s opposition, “but we’re in a geographical area
that makes that pretty diﬂicult.” Because of the lower
level of competition, Jackson was not pleased with
the team’s victories, saying, “We need a higher,
degree of intensity, [and] it wasn’t there. We didn’t

Mr. T: Zip it, woman.

Alf: Forget about those losers
—I need answers about the
upcoming games. Who’s gonna
win? Who’s gonna upset? Who’s
gonna step it up?‘

Mr. T: Can it, furball. But
since you asked, I like
Georgetown. The Hoyas are one
of the hottest teams in the tour-
ney. And Allen Iverson, he’s the
man. He has more glamour in a
single spin move than I have
around my neck No one can
stop him. He’s the best point
guard I have ever seen in college
and hands down the best player
in the nation. Oﬁense, defense,
Iverson’s the total package like
Clubber Lane. He ain’t afraid of
no one. And if chumps get in his
way, they’ll be dropping quicker
than Rocky.

Alf: But how conveniently
you forget what happened to
Clubber Lane the second time
around? That’s what’s going to
happen to Iverson and the
Hoyas. They’re going down to
UMass in the Elite Eight.
Georgetown’s Othella
Hanington won’t know what to
do when Marcus Camby throws
down six nasties on his head. No
one will be able to stop him.

Warwick: Hold on a minute. I
see a vision. I see a pack of sleek
silver dogs mushing straight to
the Final Four. And its leader, a
handsomely groomed Husky
whose skills are rivaled by no
other, will be the Final Four
Most Valuable Player.

Shakespeare: Stop speaking
in riddles, you sorry excuse for a
seer. However, I must concur. I
believe that Ray Allen will lead
UConn to the championship
game. But much like Romeo and
Juliet, they will suffer an ill-fated
death to Kentucky in the title
game. By the way, Alf, would
you be so kind as to pass another
Keystone Premium? ,

Mr. T: Hark! I mean, that stu~
pid game is trying to tell us
something.

Warwick: Mr. T is right. I
