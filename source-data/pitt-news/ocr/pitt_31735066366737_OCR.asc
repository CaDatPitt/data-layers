. Johnson Budget Cuts NDEA Loans

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

EDITORIAL: ‘

The Loan Crisis

A travesty" is being committed against American educa-
tion by the failure to continue the National Defense Student
Loan (NDSL) program in "the ’Johnson"s administration’s 1967
ﬁscal budget.

-Since the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) estab-

., lislled the loan program in r. 1959, NDSL has provided innumer- .

‘able people the opportunity of a college education. Students

/sessed good academic potential, could borrow money from the
federal government and pay it back at low interest rates over
a reasonable period of time. University students have bene-
ﬁted by more than $1 million per year over the past ﬁve years.

state legislatures and innumerable state banking and loan agen-
cies with many other areas for proﬁtable investment will have
to be convinced of .FIL’s proﬁtability before September.

If Congress fails to reinstate the $180 million NDEA.pro-
gram; we fear that students ‘will be fair’ game for many’mur-
derous loan agencies with high interest rates. While the state
legislatures and banking and loan groups are being told about
-2" FIL, students may be forced togo to such loan agencies to se-
cure their e.ducation.

son budget. We believe Congress has no alternative but to re-
instate the $180 million NDEA program.’ We heartily urge that
the following action be taken to speed revision of the Johnson
budget and reinstatement of the NDEA program:

> A pro-NDEA’ letter writing campaign to all legislators
in Washington, D. C., by all students, faculty, parents,
and administrators who believe in higher education. Out-
of-state students at the University should write to their
home state senators and representatives and urge their
parents to take similar action. Pennsylvanians should
write their local representatives and: ,
Honorable. Joseph Clark Honorable Hugh Scott
United States Senator ‘ United States Senator
Senate Office Building Senate Office Building
Washington, D.C. Washington, D.C.

. > Student Government and 7 Faculty Senate resolutions
urging the reinstatement of NDEA in the national bud-
get, with copies being sent to all United States Sena-
tors and to local - newspapers. _

/5 A personal visit to Harrisburg by'Mr. Critchﬁeld and
Acting Chancellor David Kurtzman expressing their sup-
port of NDEA. 

A strong, continuous exercise ”of public opinion in favor of

NDEA’s reinstatement, is the only way to insure Congressional

should act now to support these measures if he wants and
supports education.

University studentsxwith National Defense Ed-
ucation Act (NDEA) loans will have to obtain other
aid next fall unless Congress reinstates the loan

'prograrn into the current Johnson administration,

“As it now stands,” said Jack Critchﬁeld, di-
rector of admissions, “unless Congress changes the
the National Defense Student
Loan (NDSL) program will at best be drastically '
reduced and at worst, completely cut.” '

Critchﬁeld advised students to prepare for the
possible consequences and get student and parent
reaction into legislators immediately. “The Uni-
versityvhas no power here,” he said. “The only
thing which can change the situation is action
by Congress. Congress must act .by March 15 or

NDSL is a $180 million-a-year program which
has existed since 1959. It was cut by the Johnson
administration this year when the president asked
the. Department of Health, Education, and VWel-
fare (HEW) to trim its allotted budget,

“Approximately 1,500 undergraduates per year
for the past ﬁve years have borrowed atotal of
over $1 million-a-year at the University,” said

In November, 1965, a new Federal Insured _
Loan (FIL) program was established by Congress ’_
to replace NDSL over a four year phasing-out plan.
‘FIL provides that a student may borrow a maxi-
mum of $1,000 per year through either a commer-
cial bank, lending group, or state agency. . /

. Although  would use the same criteria for
eligibility as NDSL, the commercial agencies would
have the authority to (1) grant or deny a loan
and (2) determine the amount. Under NDSL pro-
gram, the University decides who receives loans

Nineteen hundred and sixty-seven would have
been the ﬁrst year of phiasingxout, but the current
proposed ﬁscal budget would force FIL to oper-
ate immediately. “The Federal Insured Loan pro-
gram is basically the same as NDS ,” said Critch-
ﬁeld. “Interest and repayment terms under both

Critchﬁeld felt the immediate replacement of I
NDSL by FIL is both impractical and unfair. “It

at least ﬁve months. No contracts have been sign’

or the commercial banks and loan associations
Although the FIL program was passed by Con-
gress, it doesn't enforce anything on any commer-
cial agency or state until the contracts are signed.” 7

If the NDEA program were cut immediately
it would be “hurting people. in the middle of their
education,” said, Critchﬁeld. ‘Everyone who all 
ters with NDSL should have the opportunity Qtc 
_ﬁnish out their education under that program.”, ,

The University had applied for $1.4

-* While Sir Laurence Olivier’s
uselof blackface makeup remains
at favor-itesubject for critics, it
hasalso swayed attention from
certain basic ﬂaws and unherald-
 , ‘strengths in the current ﬁlm.
‘_‘.'.v,ersion of Othello now at_ the
-7 King's Court theatre.
:Where this production fails is
'-in the imbalance created between
*jOlivier’s Othello and Iago, the
--'Moor’s ensign who “proves” the
_ “infidelity of Othello’s wife Des-
 ‘ demona. This is as much a fault.
irof-‘Olivier as it is a credit to
2 Frank Finlay, who portrays Iago’s
villainy with unexpected simpli-
ciity. ' .-

. According to a publicity state-
? inent, ‘fFinlay’s determinedly un-
_academic Iago attracted a
ﬁercely mixed press” when he
~ first performed the role for the
A British National Theatre in 1964.
‘‘I didn’t play it for melodrama,”
,.he replies to this criticism, “or
for intellectuals — after all, the
gyvhole of Venice called him ‘hon-
_lest Iago,’ and Othello trusted
‘him implicity. His villainy is in
 his ordinariness.”
' It is this simplicity that is off-
;set by 0livier’s barbaric enthu-
-siasm over Othello, a zeal that
often lapses into total incompre-
Vhensibility. This renders the ill-

 

 §\‘\~

fated Desdemona’s utterance in
Act IV a particularly apt descrip-
tion of Olivier, if not Othello: ‘fl
understand a fury in your words,
but not the words.”

Seldom does Othello loom here
as the crafty Moorish general,
the sly rhetorician, the. unshak-
fable husband. Olivier’s Othello is
doomed by an unexpectedly low
mentality that mak_es the evil
persuasion performed by Fin-
1ay’s Iago even easier.

And where the ﬁlm derives its
excellence is from the work of
these unadvertised people: Fin-
lay, Maggio Smith as Desdemona,
Emilia, and Derek Jacobi as Cas-
sio, the honorable lieutenant of
Othello whom Iago has set out to
ruin. They and others more than
compensate for what Olivier him-
self describes as“over-indulgence”
by an actor over his role.

Aside from the disappontments,
this Othello is still Shakespeaa-re’s
powerful play; this is why it is
worth seeing. The techniques of
cinema have not been overly ex-
ploited, only for random “quo-
tations” such as the close-up of
Desdemona’s d r op p e d handker-

’chief — which later on becomes
vital to the plot—and a priceless
close-up of Iago as Cassio is say-
ing of him “I never knew a Flor-

has been described as an effort
to take stock of Western thought
on subjects which have been of
continuing philosophical interest
from the advent of philosophy in
ancient Greece to the present
day. This work, a" result of Ad-
ler’s previous work on the Synto-
picon, is essentially an analysis
of philosophical literature from
the perspective of the great ideas.
Because of its relevance to the
contemporary scene, freedom was
chosen as the first idea to be
treated. In 1958, volume one The
Idea of Freedom was published.
Volume two was published in
1961. '

According to Time, Adler

.“writes too well, and has made

too much money to be accepted
by scholars as one of themselves.
He has been denounced as a char-
letan, a sensation-seeker, a me-
dieval reactionary, a would-be

All theirony is intact, and
theme of “appearance v e r s u s
reality” is well-conveyed through

‘the medium of the ﬁlm..But the
play is still one of words, although
the words are not always under-
standable. Through a comparison
of Iago’s statement “. . I am

mona’s “My Lord is notmy Lord”
description of Othello in Act III,
and “Othello’s “That’s he ;that‘

ment in Act V, we see'the lan-.
guage reﬂecting the distorted
values of the play.

And while critics have recent-
ly returned to 0thello’s racial sit-
uation asa result of Sir Laurence’s
makeup, the themes of light and
dark in the play have always
been there, and always more
than skin tleep. This production,
for all its weaknesses, remains
faithful to those themes in dra-
matizing Desdemona’s purity and
Iago’s evil. For all its Shakespear-
ean power, or for its possible con-
temporary relevance, it is a ﬁlm
worth seeing.

g-Four ' Arrangements

, Of Trimester Listed

Editor, The ‘Pitt News:

It seems strangethat the tri-
.,-mester system, with all its ad-
sevantages, is to be discarded just
when its contributions could be
the greatest. Among the excel-
lent reasons for a system of tri-
mesters or quarters is the fact
that more students can be accom-
'.modated in fewer buildings by
-wise planning and staggering the
'-terms of attendance.

~_ The University looks forward
to doubling enrollment, which
will no doubt lead to crowding
and a search for more class-
rooms, labs, and library space.
-At the same time, the University
‘is seriously considering ending
the third trimester because too
few students choose to attend it.
There are several alternatives
- which would retain the trimes-
.lter’and its advantages of early
7 graduation, long working sum-

" Iﬁexibility in scheduling for stu-.
dents, efficient utilization of
.space, year round employment of
faculty.

 (1) Some students could be en-
couraged to attend trimesters two
land three rather. than one and
$tv}fO.., Working students would
have the same number of months
gfree, and they might ﬁnd it an
advantage in job hunting to be
able to offer an employer their
vervices during the busy fall sea-
son rather, than the quieter
spring. The attraction of winter
sports might persuade some va-
,i.cation,ing students to attend the
[spring term.

to attend the second and third,
some the ﬁrst and third, and
some all three. In at least one
school which recently converted
to year round operation (Antioch
College in Ohio) students are as-
signed to begin school either in
the summer or fall and follow a
pattern of work and study quar-
ters. A
(3) A system should be devel-
oped whereby ’ students could
have the experience offered by
“co-operative education.” Under
systems in use at many scientiﬁc
and liberal arts schools,_ students
attend school for a term, then
work in a job related to their in-
terest for a term. Two or more
students alternate "on the same
job, “cooperating” to ﬁll it for a
year. The employer has a steady
employee and the students get a
chance at better jobs than might
be possible with seasonal work.
(4) The University might just
sit back for another year, “sell”
the trimester on its present mer-
its, and see how many students
take advantage of it when tuition
‘is down to a manageable level.
Many students who now take
four years to go through college
do "so because they must work
ﬁve months in the summer to pay
for their two trimesters. The ad-
vantage of $675 for three trimes-
ters over $700 for one is obvious.
. The University has a good idea
in the trimester system. It would
be a step backward to abandon
it now when the students to ﬁll

the third trimester are in view.

Editor’s note: Acting Chancel-
lor David Kwrtzman has stated
several times that lack of facil-
ztzes necessitates that a portion
of the 1000 student z'n.crease at-
tend the spring trimester. They

would be accepted on this basis
only. i . .

‘More’ and Better’

, University Girls ’
Editor, The Pitt News:

As many parents do, mine have
been complaining lately that I
should meet some new and bet-
ter girls from the University. So,
last-Friday and Saturday “nights,
I went,_to the two dances /in the
Student Union Ballroom. Well, I
had a terriﬁc time and met many
very interesting girls, but out of
the dozen ‘or so that I danced
with, not one was from the Uni-
versity. Instead, I found nurses
from St. Frances and Mt. Mercy,
secretaries from Dormont and
North Hills, beauticians from East
Liberty and Oakland, and a mul-
titude of high school (HS) girls
from everywhere.‘ On the "dance

ﬂoor were local hoodlums danc-‘

ing, in the men’s room were HS
boys drinking, and’ beside the
water fountains were‘ grade-
schoolers hustling people for nic-
kels. I used to think the UMOC
dance was a big University stu-
dent function. I thought I was in
the Oakland Community Center.

I did recognize some Universi-
ty girls but I didn’t want to be
seen with them.éSomehow'a 20

year old’ slice of womanhood
dressed in blue-jeans, ‘out-turned
sweatshirt, and slopply Hair does
not turn me on, at least at a
dance-social. Bob Dylan says this

2 brings out man’s animal instincts,

but if I want to make out with
animals I can go to the zoo or
buy a genuine dog at the Pet
Centre. Some University “girls did
look rather nice, but ‘mostly, 4 it

was the secretaries and HS girls 7

that looked like real live women.

I think that University stu-
dents should be encouraged more
to attend Student Union func-

.tions, ‘ instead of complaining of

nothing to do on Saturday nights.
After all, we are paying $5 per
trimester for student activities.
Girls should be required to dress
at dances like the young ladies
that they are. (This alone may
attract more people.) Non-college
students, such as secretaries and
HS kids, sho'uld not be admitted,
while student nurses and stu-
dents from other campuses should
be invited to share ideas and in-
terests. My parents have to"pay
HS taxes, but I don't think I
should pay for their social activ-
ities.

gers’ Year, Rom

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Nothing could have been better for the basketball team
than an upset win over Penn State to end the year. Hadn’t
the Panther football team salvaged its‘ losing season that

way ?

But it was too much to ask of the crippled cagers. Penn
State came to play, not to rest up for their showdown meet-

ing with Syracuse tonight. The
Nittany Lions played to show the
1,332 fans in attendance why
they are going to the NIT.

State decided the 89-57 run-
away in the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of
action. Carver Clinton hit on a
jump shot with the game barely
eight seconds old. Then Ray San-
ders scored two quick baskets
and it was 6-0 after two minutes.

It was 14-1 after ﬁve. The Pan-
thers didn’t score their first ﬁeld
goal until 5:25 had elapsed. Three
minutes later the scoreboard had
Penn State in front, 22-6.

Sloppy play by the cagers con-
tributed Ito the Lion bombard-
ment as much as everything else.
There were numerous turnovers
during those first seven or eight
minutes that prevented Panther
shots from being taken.

But nobody at the Field House
could doubt that the Lions were
breaking open their own game.-
When halftime momentarily end-
ed the onslaught at 50-26, Penn
State had hit on 21 of 32 shots.

In comparison, the Panthers

made only eight of 28. Both Ken
Bollens and Bob Lovett played
with injuries. Lovett was a sur-
prise participant. He hadn't ﬁg-
ured to dress, let alone play.

It was obvious, though, that
Lovett couldn’t take the corner
jump shot that is his forte. It
was obvious that he couldn’t
jump period. But he still man-
aged seven points in his ﬁnal
effort.

“We had to try to improvise,”
said coach Bob Timmons. “With
two sub-par men in there, We had
to adjust our defense. Unfortun-

,ately Penn State moved a lot

quicker than they did the last
time we played them.

Jim Reed sparked the Lions’
offense with driving layups that
frequently found him sprawled
out underneath the basket. He
also hit consistently from the
outside with 25 foot jump shots.
The combination netted him 25
points to lead all scorers.

“I love this court,” Reed fair-
ly bubbled in the post-game chat-

my shooting always seems to

Clinton did pretty well for
himself, scoring 20 points and
grabbing 14 rebounds. But he-

Frosh Drop Last Game

By ROY JACOBS

Losing a basketball game
because -of foul shooting
leaves a team wondering
about a season's worth of
hustle and effort of getting
position for rebounds, play-
ing tight defense, and working an
offense. Saturday, the freshman

cagers worked hard against the
Duquesne frosh but lost their ﬁnal

3 game at the foul line, 75-70.

“We outplayed them and lost.
I think we really outplayed
them,” reviewed coach Tim Grgu-
rich. “We just can’t shoot fouls.”
The foul shooting issue focused
on the ﬁnal six minutes of the

. game. Both teams, were involved

with the one-and-one situation.
The little Dukes failed to score

I; "1 g a field goal the rest of the way

but shot 13-17 from the free
throw line, never missing the
ﬁrst shot while the one-and-one
was in effect. The Cubs, on the
other hand, shot only 7-14. Al
D_iFrischia was the prime offend-
er, converting only one of four,
but he wasn't alone. Steve Stev-

 i enson and Tim Fisher also missed

 
 

, Major,

on crucial one-and-one attempts.

The fouls had an effect on the
other side of the ledger, too. Gary
Duquesne’s 6-8 center,
picked up his fourth personal af-

* ter 13 seconds of the second half.

At the time, the Dukes led, 41-33.
When he returned 11 minutes
later, the lead had been cut to
60-59. Both Major and 6-7 Larry
Abraham fouled out within the

next ﬁve minutes, and the Cubs
were getting some breaks on the
rebounds. Then, with 2:13 re-.
maining, Dave Welty fouled out.

“They realy did a great job,”
said Grgurich afterwards, “and
they never gave up——even with-
out Dave in there.” Still, without
Welty the only offense the frosh
could muster was four for eight
from the foul line—no ﬁeld goals.

Although most of the second
half was nip and tuck, Duquesne
had the game well in hand dur-
ing the ﬁrst half, building sever-
al leads of ten points. The game
was close through the ﬁrst six
minutes, then in one three min-
ute stretch the Duke’s big men
deposited four tap-ins while the
Cubs could manage only one bas-
ket, to open an eight point lead.

“It was those second and third
shots that hurt us. We’re still not
smart enough,” explained Grgu-
rich. “Lenny (Kalata), Steve, and
Al still have to learn some tricks.
Next year. they’ll be smarter.”

One main difference between
Saturday’s game and the frosh’s
76-75 victory over Duquesne ear-
lier in the season was that the
Dukes’ top guard John Beane was
around until the end of this
game. Beane contributed 19 points
to the winners’ cause and was
perfect" from the foul line in six
attempts in the last five minutes.

Lenny Kalata and Sylvestor
Stevenson led the frosh scoring
with 18 and 17, respectively, but

spearhead a Panther surge that

second half. If was virtually the
only chance for the crowd to
cheer during the game. ,

The “rally” was shortlived. The
Lions began to score again and
were increasing the gap as the
buzzer sounded. ,

Although his shooting was off,
Larry Szykowny scored 14 points
in his ﬁnal game, second only to

 PenniState

By TOM SACKS
Assistant Sports Editor
If coach Dave Johnson still
thinks that the main reason
for the wrestling teams’ poor
show‘ing this year is lack of
experience, he must have
at least had some second
_thoughts after the .22-10 loss to
Penn State Saturday night.
Both the Nittany Lions and the
wrestlers had seven sophomores
in their respective «line-ups. State
has lost‘ only two meets this year
——to Lehigh and Navy. The mat-
men have won only two-—Syra-
cuse and West Virginia.
Considering the intra—state re-
‘ cruiting battle that goes on be-
tween State and Pitt the Lions
must have had easy pickin’ two
years ago. .
Despite losses to both Lehig
and Navy, Penn State might pos-
sibly have the second best dual
meet team in the East. Its loss
to the Engineers was the ﬁrst
meet 01.’ the season for them. Le-
high had already wrestled in ﬁve.
Wrestler Jack Williams con-
curs. “They’ve got a lot of
strength in their sophomores. I
think they are better than Le-
high now.” '

In Season’s Last Dual Meet 5

..».

JIM SACCO runs through his routine on the side horse in last
Saturday’s.meet with Teinple. The Owls ramped, 168.95-155.00, in
the ﬁnal dual‘ meet of the season.

. By MAX PEPPER
- The gymnasts finished their season in typical style los-

ing to Temple 168.95—é155.0,0, Saturday. Temple completely
swamped -~ the gym team, taking every one of the seven

events. The best the gymnasts could do was to take one

ﬁrst and four seconds.

One of the reasons for the

niﬁcant looking gymnast named’
Mark Cohn. Cohn, who stands no
taller than 5-5, gave the best one
man performance of any of the
Panther’s opponents this season.
He took three first, a second, and
third. On the basis. of 10- points
as perfect, in ﬁve events, Cohn
\ pulled scores of 8.65, 9.55, 9.15,
 9.10, and 9.00 Cohn’s perform-
ance on the side horse was worth
9.55, whipping through an ex-
tremely difficult routine, which
included several series‘of C tricks.
Even with .Cohn’s great per-
formance, he needed‘ help‘ from
his teammates to beat the Pan-
thers. Temple’s Norm Mittman
took a ﬁrst on the still rings,
A '. beating his closest competitor,
 , Dave McKinnis, 9.05-8.75. Owls

any luck at all, he may take the
Eastern championships this week-
end.”

,- The aim team’s only» bright
spot of the day was Dave Shide-
rnantle’s performance in the long ,
horse vaulting. Shidemantle, who
was still recovering from an arm
injury suffered in practice, scored
9.20, which was just enough to
nose out ‘Temple’s Mark Cohn,
who scored 49.10. McKinnis, who’s

_ The ﬁrst period of their match
ended in a 0-0 deadlock. Williams,
on the bottom in the second per-
iod, escaped within 10 seconds of
the referee’s whistle. With nei~_ A
ther one being able to bring about '
a takedown’, the third period
started with Williams in the of-
fensive position this time. Wil-
liams rode him for about a min-
ute before Seitz escaped, missing
riding time by only a few seconds.
“I couldn’t shoot for his feet
for a takedown because my shoul-
der is still messed up,” said Wil-
liams, “but I did have him on his
back a couple of times but the
referee kept saying we were off

‘ the mat.”

The referee was saying quite

a lot at University Park as Rudy .

Kahler will agree. Kahler at 167
also drew with his opponent, Matt
Kline, 4-4. The referee was the
deciding ijactor in this one, pen-
alizing Kahler two points for
stalling. V
The ﬁrst period ended 2-1 in
Kahler’s favor after a takedown
and an escape by Kline. Kline
escaped‘ again in the second per-
idd, evening the score at 2-2. In
the ﬁnal period Kahler escaped.
Then the referee stepped in. ‘He
penalizedxboth Kahler and Kline

. for stalling, then hit Kahler again“

with another penalty about, a
minute later.

Besides the two draws, the
wrestlers also boasted two vic-
tories. One was Ron Schuchert’s
9-1 romp over Torn Hostetter. The
other came in the heavyweight
division where Terry Hoover de-
cisioned Jim Emanuel, 6-1.

Swim Teani
Seventh Loss

By GEORGE LIES

Stomach pains do not bother
coach Ben Grady constantly, but
when they do he blames the
swimming team’s poor record,
3.-7. He looked for some relief at
Ohio University last‘ Saturday,
but all he found was an empty
aspirin bottle, as the mermen
lost, 63-32. ‘

“The boys tried hard. and my
seniors and sophomores are do-
ing their part,” Grady said, ,“but
the juniors are not holding up
their end. They are going to have
to wake up because they leave
us weak in the middle of our
lineup.” V -

The lone exception to the
spreading junioritis is Gary Mar-
tin. He swam on both losing re-.
lay teams, besides ﬁnishing sec-
ond to Ohio’s Phil Krueger in the
100-yard freestyle-

Another factor contributing to
the swimmers’ seventh loss was
Jack.Volz. “He was called away
unexpectedly on a very pressing
domestic problem,” Grady said.
With him not in the meet, Grady
said, “the boys were low, morale-
wise.” ’ S

Voltz’ departure left Grady

without a top point getter. “Us- —

ually in a meet, I can expect 20
or at least 17 points from three
boys, (Joe) LeViere, (John) Lane
ahd" Volz.” _ ,.
Against Ohio, ﬁve seconds in
the relays and what would have
been ﬁve points from Volz event,

‘the breaststroke made the differ-

ence in the score. Ohio picked-‘up
14 points in winning the two re- .
lays. In the freestyle relay, they
won by one and one-half seconds;
in the medley relay. themermen
lost by three seconds. '

released his pent-up energy in"
the ﬁnal three minutes. He ﬁrst
escaped, then” added four points

for a takedown and predicament,
picking up two more pointsalong
the way for riding time.

In the other matches sopho-
more Wally Clark decisioned Dick
Shildt, 9-1. Cliﬁ Zolikoff, who has
lost over 40 pounds this season,
also lost to State’s Vince Fitz, 14-
4. Other losers were Jim Rhone,
Al Traunsteiner, Clair Riley and
Tim Trax.
