Program to increase
awareness of AIDS

By Ugochi Oyoyo

Staff Writer

Local newspapers and TV sta-
tions will attend tonight’s presen-
tation on AIDS awareness by
Richard P. Keeling, a medical
doctor and chairman of the task
force on AIDS for the American
College Health Association.

The Panhellenic Association
and the Interfraternity Council in-
vited Keeling to inform Pitt stu-
dents about AIDS.

The Pitt Creek Program, Our
Choice, ”regularly brings in dy-
namic speakers who know their
material and can play on people’s
emotions so they’ll listen and take
home the information they need
to protect themselves,” said
Chuck Farinella, president of the
IFC. ”And from what I under-
stand, Dr. Keeling is by far the
best authority on AIDS.”

The presentation isn't just for
Greeks. ”The whole student
body should be there,” said
Farinella, “because it’s just as im-
portant to educate Greeks as it is
to educate independents.”

In October, Our Choice ad-
dressed alcohol abuse by inviting
Dr. Tom Goodall, vice president
for Student Affairs at Virginia

Tech, to speak to the student

body on ”Drinking Responsibly.”
”Next term, we're going to ad-
dress sexual awareness and haz-
ing,” said Farinella.
Keeling’s address will be Our
Choice’s last program for this
semester. ”Some things that I

asked Dr. Keeling to discuss are
AIDS, AIDS testing, safe sex,
transmittability of diseases, unin-
tended sex, acquaintance rape,
survey information and national-
ized statistics,” said Farinella.

"It's about time they brought
someone to campus,” said Daivd
Dellett, a CAS junior studying
business economics. ”Of all
places [AIDS discussions] are
needed, it's here.”

Farinella said, ”We’re dealing
with a population that is young,
very vulnerable and impression-
able and subject to a tremendous
amount ofpeer pressure.

”Some people are going to
have an attitude like ‘Oh, you're
going to an AIDS program. You
got the disease or something?’
"And the worst thing that could
happen is that people won't show
up because they're afraid of the
impression it’ll cast on .their
friends,” said Farinella.

’’Where we really need speak-
ers like [Keeling]/’ said Theresa
Costello, a CAS junior majoring
in biology, ”is in the high
schools, because most high
school students don't go to col-
lege and there’s mandatory atten-
dance at high school functions.”

”All the new initiates into the
Greek system are required to at-
tend this program,” said Farinel-
la. ”So we have a guaranteed
audience which was about 400 at
the October event with
Goodall.”

But only 20 or 25 of those at

Campus group holds
international dinner

By Karen D. Speece
Staff Writer

An international dinner will be
sponsored by the Overseas De-
velopment Network on Friday,
Dec. 2 at 6 p.m. on the second-
floor suite in Forbes—Quadrangle.

The Overseas Development
Network is an organization of stu-
dents dedicated to education in
the areas of hunger, poverty and
international awareness in Third
World countries.

According to Bob Fries, ODN
is ”sponsoring a project in
Nicaragua. We'll use the money
we receive to educate children in
an orphanage with agricultural
skills.”

ODN's agricultural develop-
ment project was started last year
by the University of Pittsburgh's
ODN group.

The Network is an internation-

al organization based at Harvard
University. It has branches at
several universities throughout
the country.

Last year, over 100 people at-
tended the International Dinner.
A variety of foods from places
such as Indonesia, Nigeria and
Swaziland were featured.

Admission to this year's dinner
will be $5, or an international
dish that feeds five. Everyone at-
tending is encouraged to wear
traditional dress.

On Saturday, April 1, I989,
ODN will be hosting a confer-
ence dealing with development
issues. The subject being ad-
dressed is the impact that the Rea-
gan years have had on Third
World countries in the areas of
hunger, aid and environmental
conditions.

Students to design new PPC logo

By Jim Tezak
Staff Writer

The Pitt Program Council will
award a portable CD player as
the prize to the winner of its con-
test to design a new logo that will
better represent the organization.

The PPC’s current logo was
probably designed in 1980 or
1981 when the organization was
formed, according to Melanie
Naro, the student coordinator for
the PPC. It was supposed to
represent the PPC's original slo-
gan, ”everything under the sun.”

”We’ve come to realize that
that really doesn't depict what we

do,” Naro said.

The PPC is sponsoring this logo
contest because, according to
Naro, the PPC Chairpersons are
interested in seeing how students
depict the organization.

The contest is open to all
University of Pittsburgh students
and has only one rule: The logo
must emphasize the words ”Pitt
Program Council,” not the initials
PPC. Other than that, students
may be as creative as they wish
and can submit as many different
entries as they like.

Entries will be judged by the
Executive Board of the PPC. The
winning logo will then be sent to

the university’s Board of Cover-
nors for approval.

”We’ll pick one idea or con-
cept that we like the most. We
want to be sure that whatever we
pick can represent what we're
about for a long time,” Naro said.

Entries should be turned in at
room M-30 on the ground floor
of the William Pitt Union. Logos
should be submitted on a sheet
of paper no larger than 8‘/2 inches
by 11 inches.

The deadline for contest entries
is Jan. 31, 1989. All entries be-
come the property of the PPC.
The PPC reserves the right to alter
any of the logos received.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jeff
DiPasquale would look with
longing as street hockey players
glided down the streets of south
Philadelphia and gathered in cir-
cles on the corners.

The 13-year-old has never been
able to play. But he is now ready
to join a game, after a lifetime of
sickness, pain and brushes with
death.

”The only problem now is l
have to learn to skate,” said the
wisecracking eighth-grader, who
has undergone four major oper-
ations since kidney disease struck
him as an infant.

A little more than 14 months
ago, in two operations spaced a
month apart, his non-functioning
kidneys were removed and
replaced with a healthy kidney
from his father.

The transplant has been suc-
cessful, but his illness has caused
other complications, including
severe hypertension, bone dis-
ease and cataracts that cloud his
vision.

And the medication that he has
to take has caused him to gain 50
pounds

The weight has bothered him

imately 2,000 flyers across the
Pitt campus during the past two
weeks, according to Farinella.
”But nobody reads posters,” said
Sandi Klimkowski, CAS senior in
political science. ”There are so
many of them up, none of them
stand out.”

”The Pitt News is probably the
biggest way to get information
out,” said Mike Vallor, a CAS
junior studying biology.

”The Pitt News route didn't
seem feasible,” said Farinella,
"because the last issue of The Pitt
News to come out before vaca-
tion was on last Tuesday [Nov.
22], and then this one.

”So we did what we could by

2 getting the flyers out to as many

places on campus as possible,”
said Farinella. ”We gave the
R.A.s of the dorms stacks of
posters and asked them to make
it a part of their program. '

"We even left messages and
stacks of flyers with leaders of
many student organizations such
as BAS, the pharmacy school, the
nursing student organization, and
even the Engineering Student
Cabinet,” he added.

Other students questioned the
timing of the event. Lisa Boyle, a
junior in the school of pharmacy,
said that ”I’d love to go, but I've
got finals coming up.”

Dellett said ”Right now, every-
one’s in a schizophrenic, para-

,noid state about finals. AIDS is

the last thing on everyone’s
mind.”

. U.S. overstepping its  
right and obligations

The response to Secretary of State George P. Shultz’s
decision to deny PLO chairman Yasir Arafat's application
for a visa has been quite strong.

European leaders, along with their Arab counterparts,
criticized the Reagan administration, saying that the United
States had an obligation to the United Nations that it was
ignonng. “

The move, while commendable in thought, is a bad
move to make during a turning point in the Middle East
situation. ' I

There is no denying the fact that Arafat has terrorist con-
nections and has condoned terrorism. There is also cause
to be skeptical of the changes in the actions of the PLO.
But this is not enough to justify the denial ofArafat’s visa.

In an article in The New York Times, writer Paul Lewis
said, ”Essentially, the United States is viewed as claim-
ing the right to stop any foreign dignitary fromcattending
the sessions of the United Nations if it happens to disagree
with that person's policies or point of view. .. ”

Whether or not Arafat is a terrorist and undeserving of
recognition is irrelevant. A decision like that should be
made by the U.N. ~ I

The U.S. government has shown careless arrogance in
making such a decision. The U.N is supposed to be neu-
tral territory and the U.S. government is misusing the
honor of having the U.N. inside our country. The U.N.
resides inside our borders, yet we do not and should not
control what goes on inside U.N. doors.

Besides, our country was founded on the right of free
expression. We should not be hypocritical by refusing to
give Arafat a chance to speak as well.

in exploring the ”what to do”
question.  Ms. Vozel’s sweep-
ing statements that I. State Col-
lege residents ”live for the
Nittany Lions,” and 2. "it's pret-
ty expensive to live at State Col-
lege” reveal gross distortions of
the truth and faulty logic.  State
College is a living and thriving
separate entity from Penn State;
not everyone is a Penn State en-
thusiast. As for Ms. Vozel's se-
cond broad generalization, after
reading the places where she
presumably frequented, I can see
where she got the idea. The
places mentioned are some of the
more expensive ones found in
State College. ’

It is too bad Ms. Vozel’s
preconceived notions limited her
explorations into the State Col-
lege nightlife. She might have
saved a lot of money as well as
(perhaps) had an eye—opening ex-
perience. There are 20 to 25 bars
in State College, 10 to T2 good
local bands that play at them,

seven or eight movie theaters
plus four to five student
organization-sponsored movies
on campus. Had Ms. Vozel ex-
plored the campus by daylight
she would have found four to five
museums or other artistic [and]
cultural pursuits. There is also the
variety of shops, boutiques and
bookstores that are (incredible,
but true) open on Sundays. Sorry
to shatter the illusion, but a
weekend in State College can in-
volve more that just ”gorging on
food.” It just requires a little more
turiosity and a larger sense of ad-
venture than [that ot] Ms. Lehosky
and Ms. Vozel. ’

Being a graduate student here
at " Pitt has allowed me to ex-
perience the Pitt—Penn State rival-
ry from both perspectives.
However, it is no excuse for se-
verely skewed journalism. The
"comparisons” mad_e were not
just weak but unrepresentative of
the State College/Penn State
nightlife. You stand corrected (I
hope).

I could go on and on but will

fact that I drank a whole fifth of

It’s not that I am as cynical as

Final three seconds spell doom for Panthers in 80-7 9 loss

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

Paul Evans could only stand
and stare as the last three seconds
of Pitt's game against Siena un-
folded before an unusually quiet
crowd of 6,135 at the Fitzgerald
Field House last night.

That’s all Evans could do as he
watched guard Darelle Porter
take the basketball out of bounds
under the Pitt basket, watched
Siena’s defense deny the ball to
the Pitt guards, watched it
bounce out of Pitt center Bobby
Martin's hands and square into
the paws of Siena forward Steve
McCoy, who promptly threw the
ball off the glass, watched it roll
around the rim and into the
basket and propel Siena to an
80-79 upset victory over the
Panthers.

”That ball sat on the rim for an
awful long time,” said Siena
coach Mike Deane, whose team
evened its record at 1-1 with its
first victory ever over a Big East
squad. Pitt fell to 1-1.

With Pitt leading 79-78 and
only three seconds remaining,
Siena lost the ball out of bounds
under the Pitt basket and set up
a press.

”We had four perimeter play-
ers checking man—to—man. We’re

I not a pressing team, so we had to

faceguard four players on the
floor, with McCoy out in case Pitt
threw it over the top,” Deane ex-
plained.

“We were trying to do every-
thing we could to make it difficult
for Pitt to inbound it,” he added.

Evans said he wanted Porter to
put the ball in point guard Sean
Miller's hands, ”but Sean was
doubled up and he had Bobby
open/’

”I just missed the ball,” Martin
said. ’’I take the full blame. The
pass was perfect.”

But Pitt was far from perfect,
particularly in the second half. Af-
ter a sluggish opening period for
both teams, the Panthers allowed

I Siena to hit five of seven three

point shots — three by guard
Marc Brown — and 18 of 31

overall (58.1).

’’We utilized the three—point
line very well,” Deane said.

Pitt could muster only nine
baskets in the second half and
shot 38.5/for the game.

”We didn't do a whole lot
tonight,” Evans said. ”We didn't
execute well, we didn’t play
defense very well, we didn’t
shoot very well.”

The Panthers did manage to
outrebound Siena 51-29 on the
strength of sophomore Brian
Shorter’s 19 boards.

Shorter also scored 20 points,
while Martin had a team-high 21
—- 1 1 from the free-throw line —
and Rod Brookin and Jason Mat-
thews added 11 points each.

Siena was led by Brown's 21
points, and swingman Jeff Robin-
son added 20. Tom Huerter ad-
ded 18, 12 on three pointers.

Adding insult to injury, Pitt
could not take advantage of a
foul-prone Siena club. The Pan-
thers were at the line 41 times,
connecting on only 27 attempts.

Evans said his club may have
been a little cocky after defeating
Oklahoma State 93-75 last Satur-
day night.

”Siena maybe messed up our
kids. They might have been a lit-
tle too high after the Oklahoma
State game.”

Evans said that he had issued a
warning to his players about be-
coming too confident.

’’It’s one of those things where
you can't get them to wake up,”
he said.

Deane, whose team won the
North Athletic Conference title
with and received an NIT bid
with a 23-6 record last year, was
ecstatic over the opportunity to
play Pitt, and even more ap-
preciative after the victory.

”[Evans] has no interest in be-
ing big time in terms of the pros-
fession,” Deane said, noting that
many other Division I schools
would not have scheduled a
seemingly weaker opponent such
as Siena.

’’If we had ended up losing this
game by a point, it wouldn’t have

Lady Panthers split first two games of season

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
squad opened its 1988-89 season
this past weekend, splitting two
games in the first annual Lady
Panther Invitational held at Fitz-
gerald Field House on Friday and
Saturday. '

After dropping the preliminary
round game to eventual tourney
champion Eastern Kentucky,
82-79, Pitt came back to beat St.
Bonaventure 74-69 in the conso-
lation game and even their sea-
son record at 1-1.

”I’m going to start off positive-
ly,” Lady Panther head coach
Kirk Bruce said when asked to as-
sess his team's play in the tour-
ney. ’’In the Eastern Kentucky
game, I think we didn't quit when
we got down 12 at the half. I told

the girls to just chip away, and we
did.”

The visiting Lady Colonels
jumped all over Pitt after Lady
Panther Lorri Johnson scored the
first four points of the contest.
They went on a 16-2 spurt to take
control early in the half, and both
squads traded baskets for the rest
of the period. But the damage
had been done by EK, as they had
a 46-34 halftime advantage for a
margin that would prove to be
just insurmountable enough to
hold the hosts down for a narrow
victory.

In the second half, the Pitt team
slowly worked their way back
into the game, setting the stage
for a near-miraculous comeback
in the final minute of play.

With 31 seconds left, Pitt's
Denise Becher launched a three-
point shot that hit paydirt, pulling

her team within four points of the
opposition. After Cowan missed
a foul shot, Becher again came
down and methodically drilled a
trey to bring the Lady Panthers
back to within one at 80-79.
Three was not a charm on the
night, however, as Becher’s
desperation shot at the buzzer hit
to the left of the basket. ,
Johnson led Pitt with 25 points
and six rebounds for the game,
while junior guard Jen Shingler
added 18 and seven assists.
Becher was also in double
figures, contributing 11 points.
Amy Holman, Tabatha Long,
Sandy Baker and Connie Hurt
also saw extended playing time.
The next afternoon, in what is
becoming a trend that could give
Bruce nightmares, Pitt once again
was easily handled early on and
trailed 35-30 at halftime. Long,

who played much better than she
did against Eastern Kentucky,
used her quickness to work well

inside for Pitt and score 10 points

to lead her club at the half.

”We get off to a bad start a lot,”
Bruce stated, referring to last sea-
son. ”It seems like in the begin-
ning of games, we have to be
behind for us to get in gear. We
played hard, but that drives me
crazy.”

At the start of the second half,
however, Johnson led the Lady
Panthers on a 20-5 spurt that put
the Lady Bonnies away. She
scored 1 1 of those points from all
angles of the court, as her attack
ranged from 18-foot jumpers to
strong play inside.

To put it mildly, it was eight
minutes of action that did noth-
ing to tarnish Johnson's reputa-
tion as an All—American

candidate.

”Lorri’s the kind of player who
can take control of a game like
that,” Bruce said. ”I issued a
challenge to her as a woman and
a basketball player before the sea-
son to bring us up a level.

”She can dominate a game in
a lot of ways. She's a good pass-
er, a good scorer and a good re-
bounder. We need her to take
control like that this season."

St. Bonaventure could get no
closer than three, and that came
with just 24 seconds left. Johnson
once again led her squad with 22
points and 12 rebounds for the
game, while Long contributed "I 6
and eight, Shingler notched 15
points and Hurt put in 11.

Despite the win, Bruce was still
disgusted with the fact that SB

Pitt wrestling team takes sixth

place in Lock Haven In vitational

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

The wrestling team finished
sixth overall in the Lock Haven
Invitational this past weekend in
what Coach Rande Stottlemyer
characterized as a ”chance for us
to get our feet wet” before the
regular season begins.

Four of the teams finishing
ahead of Pitt are in the top 20.
Lock Haven, Penn State, Iowa
State and North Carolina State
pulled up 1-4 respectively. Le-
high University finished a surpris-
ing fifth.

Stottlemyer was pleased with
the team's individual perfor-
mances, although he was slight-
ly disappointed with Pitt’s overall
finish.

”We wrestled hard; it was a
tough tournament,” Stottlemyer
said. ’’We have a lot of young
guys who lack experience, and I
think our rookies got a nice dose
of experience this weekend.”

Injuries continue to plague the
Panthers. Senior Jeff Turner, 158
pounds, is still out with a knee in-
jury. Stottlemyer said, ”The fact
that Jeff is a senior and that he’s
out for a while hurts us because
we're not only missing his perfor-
mance but his leadership as
well.”

Perry Miller (190) was also out
of the action this past weekend
but is expected to be back on the
mat within a matter of days.

Seven Pitt wrestlers placed at
Lock Haven.

Defending NCAA national

champion Pat Santoro (142) won
his match; Scott Hovan placed
second at 150; Dave Ciafre (158)
finished fourth; Bill Lewis (177)
also finished fourth; John Owens
and George McCormack placed
third and sixth respectively in the
heavyweight division; and Alan
Utter (142) finished third.
Stottlemyer is in the process of
gearing up his squad for the Las
Vegas Invitational taking place
this weekend. The coach feels
that this is the biggest tournament
he and his team will be involved

‘in.

”There are some great teams in
this one. We're really looking for-
ward to it. This is the best tour-
nament next to the Nationals,”
Stottlemyer said.

,Diver Ratliff a pleasant surprise for Panthers

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

Shortly after graduating from
Rosemount High School in Min-
nesota, Krissa Ratliff broke her
arm on a trampoline. This serious
break could easily have ended a

Overy promising trampoline and

diving career.

in fact, the accident occurred
just five months before Ratliff
could-have gone to France to
compete with the United States’

trampoline team.

Well, Ratliff didn't make that
trip, but now she is considered to
be one of the strongest divers in
the country. She consistently
wins for Pitt on the 1—meter board
and is steadily improving her
skills on the 3—meter board. In
fact, she took first on the 3—meter

I dive against Virginia on Saturday.

This performance qualified Ratliff
for the NCAA national qualifying

”She has tremendous physical
talent coupled with a good psy-
chological state of mind,” said
Pitt diving coach Julian Krug.
”She doesn’t have an extensive
diving background, but I think
the program here can propel her
into the right direction.”

Coach Krug is a big reason Rat-
liff, now a junior, transferred here
from Northern Michigan this
year. Because of coaching
difficulties at Northern Michigan,
she had to make a tough decision
concerning where to turn her
talent.

’’It came down to Pitt and
Nebraska,” said Ratliff. ’’But I had
a really good feeling about Julian
Krug. I knew he would be the
best personal coach for me. it
would have been a mistake for
me to go anywhere else.”

Ratliff, a psychology major, is

happy with her choice. As Ratliff
points out, she is happy to be
away from a town with only
30,000 people and nothing
higher than a two-story building.

But her lack of interest in the
small town didn't affect her div-
ing performance at Northern
Michigan. She was Division II All-
American last year. She also
placed third at nationals, one
point out of second place, which
would havequalified her for Di-
vision I nationals.

Ratliff admits the change from
Division ll to Division I is going
to be difficult.

’’I don't know how I'm going
to do this year,” said Ratliff. ’’I’m
in the process of becoming,
which means I might lose for a
while.”

Despite her impressive statistics
so far this year, Ratliff doesn't feel
that she has reached her full

her strength. She can do harder

 

potential yet. She points out that
making the transition from
coaches this year is a possible
reason. Ratliff feels her coach at
Northern Michigan used a nega-
tive approach to diving, while
Krug uses a positive approach.

’’I had to learn to enjoy diving
again,” said Ratliff. ’’I had to learn
to be able to laugh while com-
peting. _

”Sometimes I feel like asking
when the real Krissa is going to
stand up. But when the real Kris-
sa does stand up, things are go-
ing to start happening.” .

Others feel things are already
happening.

”She has handled the change
extremely well,” said Pitt wom-
en's swim coach David Be-
lowich. ”We’re very fortunate to
have someone of her capacity at
Pitt. One of her main strengths is

dives that require more strength
and ability.”

Krug agrees that her strength
has definitely been a big part of
her trampoline and diving suc-
cess. He also admits that Ratliff
has not yet reached her full
potential.

”Our major work with her is
her mental attitude,” said Krug.
”She- needs to work toward truly
achieving outstanding, perfor-
mances. She just needs more
confidence, which is coming.”

Gaining confidence shouldn't
be too hard for Ratliff to do. She
already overcame one difficult
obstacle: fear -— the fear of per-
forming again after a serious in-
jury, which is one of the toughest
things for an athlete to do.

After she shattered her arm and

went through all the surgery and

rehabilitation, she faced fear.

made a big difference. But we're
a pretty good basketball team. I
think we proved that tonight,”
Deane said.

”I won't apologize for win-
ning,” he added.

But neither team would want to
take credit for the play of the first
half. Pitt committed nine tur-

novers, Siena 10.

The Panthers took a 48-36 half-
time lead thanks to a 15-8 run late
in the first half.

Pitt's lead was 13 points —
66-53 — when Brown and Robin-
son took over for Siena with 9:12
to play. The two combined for 19
of Siena’s final 27 points, 15 on
three—pointers.

Continued from page 9

”I was very scared for awhile,"
said Ratliff. ’’I was afraid to do
things that I've been doing since
I was 6 or 7. I thought I'd lost the
edge. But I asked myself if I was
going to stop doing what I want
to do just because I'm afraid.”

She is now trying dives off the
3-meter board that perhaps no
other females in the country are
trying. She is using her trampo-
line experience to attempt tricki-
er and more difficult dives than
anybody else. E

’’In the long run, diving the
harder dives is going to get me to
where I want to go,” said Ratliff.
”My main potential is going to be
in 3-meter dives.”

Ratliff sets her hopes and goals
high. She does not want to stop
diving after her period of eligibil-
ity at Pitt is over. I {L

”I see myself as training for the
'92 [Olympics],’’ said Ratliff. ”My

diving career doesn't end in two ‘

years. I’m not done until 1992,
whether I make it or not.

”But I want to get to nationals
first and make points for Pitt and
Julian.”

But strength and talent are
often not enough to bring even
the best athletes to the Olympics.
Krug and Belowich agree that
Ratliff has other important ingrel‘
clients that will help her reach her
goals: dedication, a good attitude
and a hard-working ethic.

”Some of my biggest strengths
are my desire and determina-
tion,” said Ratliff. ”I think any-
bodywho has that, no matter
what [his] ability, can go a long
wav.” :
