Three Days of Usually Calm Fun
Send "Oriented" Freshman Home

By PETER J . BUTCH
AND RANDY GAYSEK

After a second tranquil day of
orientation, almost 2,500 Pitt
freshmen found the campus a little
less confusing very much to their
liking, according to an informal
survey of participants.

Despite obstacles such as “disor-
ganized mentor meetings” and
“mushy eggs for breakfast at 6:30
in the morning,” most newcomers
said they believed their choice of
Pitt was a good one and that they
were enjoying their three-day visit.

‘ ‘I love it (orientation). . .1 want to

Another offered that while
Monday night's dinner was good,
breakfast and lunch were poor and
that cafeteria personnel were
inordinately protective of ice
machines and tomatoes.

Though several instances of
smuggled alcoholic beverages and
smuggled members of the opposite
sex in dormitories occurred, no
major conflicts between new
students and the University estab-
lishment were reported to campus
police, according to Lt. Walt
Waters.

“We had one false alarm in

Brackenridge Hall yesterday after-
noon, but we’re not sure if it
originated in the system or if
someone pulled it,” Waters said.
He said last night that mischevious
behavior was more frequent as the
evening wore on, with water
balloons attacks on Forbes Avenue
from Brackenridge a highlight.

One student was taken to the
hospital after running into a tree on
the Cathedral lawn while chasing a
Frisbee and took stitches.

But, “as of the moment, there's
been no police trouble with the

Groups to Look At
Oakland Development

in man HARRY

Pitt is gearing for a wide-ranging
Oakland development plan in
conjunction with several civic,
business and governmental organi-
zations.

The one-year study—to be
conducted through public forums
including members of the Univer-
sity, Oakland Directions, Inc.
(ODI), the Department of City
Planning and local residents and
businesses—-—will set immediate and
long-range goals and guidelines of
future urban development in the
area, including expansion and land
use.

A separate plan will focus on
Oakland traffic and parking condi-
tions.

Implementation of both studies,
formulated by OD] and in the
planning stages for the past eight
months, hinges on a state grant of
$100,000 currently awaiting city
council approval. Combined, the
two studies’ estimated cost will be
$200,000 — for contracting profes-
sional consultants to coordinate the
program.

Group spokesmen commended
the study for attempting to resolve
issues created by urban develop-
ment in the area. They said,
however, that conflicts of interest
will exist among the residential,
commercial and institutional sec-
tors represented in the program.

Jay Roling, assistant to the vice
chancellor for public affairs, termed
the study a “logical approach” in
resolving such conflicts, and added,
“In the past, some persons’ views
were reactionary. . .issue-oriented
and not an overall analysis of total
community needs. But the program
broadens the participation process
by allowing many different persons
involved.”

Linda’ Segall, city community
planner, agreed, saying, “Conﬂicts
can be expected, but the idea is to
bring them out front and then
compromise; at least, that way
people will get what they want
instead of having nothing happen at
all.

“Any decisions made by these
groups will have an impact,” she,
added. “It is to be hoped main
priorities will be served for each
interest group.”

Asked why Oakland was chosen
for the study, Segall cited the
severity of the problem here and
quoted a documented six-year
Pittsburgh development plan re-
leased in 1976 by former Mayor
Pete Flaherty as saying Oakland

was a “key area” due to its

economic and cultural impact on the
city. ' I

She also said the program will
deal with “a lack of clear-cut

boundaries” for different types of r
‘ land uses in Oakland.

“In terms of future development,
residential groups don’t know how
stable their homes are if threatened
by University, retail, and housing
expansion . ’ ’

Roling said physical expansion of
the University tentatively has
ended, but acknowledged Pitt still
has “critica ” student housing
needs.

‘ ‘I only met my mentor once, but I
liked the lecture (by professor Irwin
Corey) and the movies,” she said.

Cheryl Savage of Ambridge,
however, was “wondering if the
people are‘, always as friendly as
they are now” and was curious
about how the campus will change
in September.

“Do things like this go on all the
time?” she asked, referring to a
WPGH radio broadcast from a truck
in the quadrangle. They don’t.

Another freshman, apparently
awed by the Cathedral and its
environs, could say only, “It’s big.”

Complaints were few and minor.

Most were aimed at traditional ,

orientation targets such as mentor
meetings and the food service.

One student said that after 

attending her first mentor meeting,

orientation kids. It's been nice and
quiet,” Waters said.

One reason for the lack of trouble
could have been the fact many
students found they had little free
time between registration and
mentor meetings, meals and
entertainment.

“It was too structured,” said
Ellen Spector, a mentor. “Not
having frat parties was stupid, since
that's what this place will be like in
the fall.

“They did have one party in
Brackenridge, with three cases of
beer, but the students involved got
'in trouble,” she said.

Another mentor thought the

compared with September’s “you-
don’t-have-to-do-anything-you-
don’t-want-to-do” atmosphere,
“presented a false impression of
what this University is like.”

“Things aren’t at all like this in
the fall,” he said. “We told the
students that_ things aren’t run like
this during the year.

“They’re just worried about
something happening here and
causing problems,” he added.
“That's why they run things so
differently during orientation. ”

More than a few students
deviated from the “required”
mentor meeting system of retriev-
ing information and orientation,
tapping other, less structured,
sources.

Mindy Kaheler, a new Student
Union information desk attendant,
said she has been inundated with
requests the past few days because
some freshmen received insuffi-
cient information prior to arrival.

“All freshmen were supposed to
have received pink slips with their
mentor's name and other vital
information,” she said, “but some
were missing a lot of information.”

Adding to the avalanche of

information requests at Kaheler’s 1

post was the fact the orientation

office was closed, making the
information desk one of the few
places equipped with the phone
numbers, procedural advice and
general hints necessary to the new
student.

“lt’s been hectic, but I like it, sort
of,” she said. “Some people come
in trying to be funny by asking
things like, ‘Where is the Student
Union?’ but generally the freshman
have been polite. They won't just
shove a dollar bill at me for change.

“I give them until October to
learn how to be rude,” she
concluded.

‘We hope freshmen will not make the mistake of believing Pitt irf
September is anything like Pitt during orientation. And that they
will, after realizing things will be greatly _changed for the better,
ainxiously await the start of fall term. .

-In an effort to avoid unfortunate incidents and paint a rosy pic-
ture of Pitt for new students and their parents, those involved with
the planning of orientation have created an overly structured
program that in no way accurately reflects year-round life in
Oakland. Instead of “oriented” to the independence of college life
and the resultant responsibilities, students are treated as if they
were on "a three—day high school field trip to a nunnerv

It was up to mentors to tell those students who bothered to at-
tend mentor meetings that, come September, there is next to
nothing a Pitt ‘student is required to do against his wishes. And that
dorms are in no way run like prison camps. And that RAs are not
patrol sergeants. And that Oakland crime is alarming. V

P But many incoming students did not get this message. Some did
not attend mentor meetings, which, after first-day gatherings, were

u‘ essentially worthless to one who had anything better to do. And

other mentors did not erase the guard-camp-in-a-fairy-tale at-
mosphere that pervaded Pitt the past few days for freshmen.

The oppressive schedule-was ridiculous: The best way to help
students adjust to campus life would be to allow them’)as much
freedom as possible. They must learn——and soon—that most
decisions at school are left to them, and that they will profit’ or lose’
by their choices. This cause is not furthered by “requiring” atten-
dance at programs and meetings that are not absolutely necessary.

A The insulation of dorms was, at best, ridiculous. Those students —
willing to go along with the security policy were penalized un-
necessarily, since phones weren’t working and only residents could
get past 24-hour guards. But worse, some students learned quickly

-— that the best way to operate at Pitt sometimes is to act first, and ap-

iswer questions later. Students entered one hall's basement "through
.a gate whose alarm wire was cut. Another was spotted attempting
to gain entrance to Holland Hall by traversing the emergency
bridge connecting Ho1land’s top floor with another dorm’s top
‘floor.’ it is at this point that the security policy appears insane.

In an effort to have everything run smoothly, orientation plan-
ners robbed students of a glimpse of what Pitt will be like when
freshmen arrive in the fall. The truth is that things don’t always go
smoothly for students, and going to the “appropriate” University
Office or officer usually‘isn’t theonly to navigate a rocky road or

arrive at an important decision.

But the truth also is that ridiculous rules usually don’t last long
here and learning to handle independence is a large part of college.
Our paution to freshmen is: things that appeared to be bad will get
better; things that appeared fantastic will sour a bit; and don’t ex-
pect to see your mentor in September. Think about your decisions
instead.

Letter to the Editor

Payne ls Rep, Not Egalitarian

In the May 26 article concerning

SGB politicking, we happened to"

notice one glaring absence. Of the
issues the -board is considering,
none have to do with the recent $100
tuition hike. It is inconceivable to us
that the SGB headed by Bernie
Payne chose to totally ignore the

tuition increase and instead take a

stand on the J. P. Stevens
controversy. We are well aware of
the importance of this situation, but

. may we remind Mr. Payne that he is
the president of the SGB at the
T University of Pittsburgh, not the‘

president of the United States.

Mr. Payne was elected as the
representative of the students at
this University, not as egalitarian of
a nation. We believe this hints at_
megalomania and is certainly not in
the best interest of the students he
serves. He is utilizing time and
money resources for a cause which
will not directly affect . our
education. Mr. Payne was quoted
in the article as saying, “We don’t
live in a vacuum;” we certainly
don’t, and Mr. Payne is not
president of a board representing a

voices like mine can make an
impression on the policy-shapers,
despite the obvious fact that neither
the President nor the pundits
noticed by squeaking in early
spring.

The human rights issue is still in
the news, largely thanks to the
latest Soviet stompings and the
Helsinki .Agreement . review in
Belgrade, but Carter and most of
the President's men have backed off
their inaugural soapboxes. Admin-
istration rhetoric and diplomatic
response to human rights violations
have taken familiar turns; the
current line seems to be less
assertive, less concrete, and more
pragmatic. . ‘ ‘

Excepting U.N. Ambassador
Young, the executive branch has
lately been conspiciously uncontro-
versial in its public pronouncements
on human rights. Wes Michaelson,
writing in the June issue of
Sojourners magazine, notes that
although military aid to Uruguay,
Ethiopia, and Argentina has been
cut, millions of U.S. dollars
continue to underwrite the status
quo in South Korea, Indonesia,
Thailand, and the Philippines. The
Administration has lobbied hard in
Congress against the Harkin
amendment, Michaelson continues,

vacuum, but students at an
‘institution of higher learning who
have real problems of their own.

We do not like the tuition
increase, nor do. we condone the
situation at J. P. Stevens’ factories.
But will the J. P. Stevens employes
show their gratiﬁcation for this

lobbying by paying the extra $50 a ‘

term for us? We doubt it. Mr.

_ Payne said that J. P. Stevens is “of
concern to students and important.

to them.” Hopefully, for the
students, his proposed random
phone survey will show what the
students are really concerned
about.

Mr. Payne may be getting some.
things moving forward in his
administration, but he has taken a
step backwards in representing the
University student by alienating‘
himself with his displays of preten-
tiousness—one . example being his
institution of rules of _behavior
within SGB ofﬁces when first
elected. These pretenses may
explain his inability to sense the
importance of the tuition hike.

 Carter's Retreat to Pragmatism

ﬁghting" legislation that would
require U.S. representatives to
international lending institutions
such as the World ‘Bank to vote
against aid to countries that
consistently violate human rights,
unless the aid directly beneﬁts the
poor. The rationale behind Carter's

-opposition to the Harkin amend-
ment is purportedly the need for
‘ ‘ﬂexibility, ’ ’ that much-valued tool
of the pragmatist.

Though disappointing,‘ Carter’s
apparent retreat to political prag-
matism is not surprising. The
pragmatic ethic (which begins with
“practical morality” and generally
ends with morality as deﬁned in
terms of vested interest) has driven
U.S. foreign policy for decades.
Robert Penn Warren suggests that
American pragmatism _ drew its
initial strength from the Civil War,
but despite its age the beast shows
little inclination to. die.

The reason it won’t die was hit
upon by Michaelson in his
Soujoumers piece: “The Carter
Administration's policies assume
that basic human rights...can be
met even as the world's wealthy
increase their riches; that protect-
ing our economic interests does not
infringe upon the hopes of the

disadvantaged; and that defending .

During his campaign, Mr. Payne“

advocated an administration that

would “get in touch.” We have, as. .
‘ of yet,‘ failed to sense his actions in

this direction. IfMr. Payne wants to
make a name for himself outside of

. this University, we would rather not

Young calls a racist a racist—--or we
can opt for a uniform and
non-pharisaic commitment to
human rights, a commitment that
might not give us a good material
return on our investment and might
even be somewhat risky. Whatever
the choice, in the ﬁnal analysis no
amount of pragmatic argument or
diplomatic rationalization will con-
ceal what is essentially a matter of
the heart.

Self-Assertiveness
And Aggressiveness

By MARY S. HUZINEC

Are you unsure of yourself? Do
you feel people get the best of yougin
social situations? Does your life
lack direction? Are you confused
but don’t know what to do about it?

Dr. Warren Hill, a counselor with
the University Counseling and
Placement Service can offer a
possible solution to your problems:
Leadership-Assertiveness Sensi-
tivity Training Groups.

‘ ‘These sessions are a new type of
personal growth group, that helps

people tune into their feelings,”,

Hill said. ' ‘

According to Hill, these sensitiv-
ity groups, slated to begin June 27,
willconsist of groups of 18 to 20
persons who meet weekly for two
hour sessions during the" summer

. term.

The groups will focus on three
major facets of personality:
aggressiveness, assertiveness and
sensitivity. Hill said he feels each of
these levels are necessary to have a
fulﬁlling life. Problems arise, Hill
claims, when a person is ‘ ‘stuck’ ’ on
one level.

Hill deﬁnes “assertiveness” as
the ability to give direction to your
life; “assertiveness” as the ability

to tune into your feelings; and

“sensitivity” as the ability to tune
into what other people are feeling.
it Examples of people “stuck” on
one level are plentiful and often
stereotyped in our culture, Hill
says. ’ = '
Woody Allen is viewed as an
oversensitive person—he worries
too much about what others think of
him. Archie Bunker, the exact

opposite is a good example of a
self-centered, insensitive person.

Sensitivity is often associated
with passivity. A passive person
rarely becomes famous because
louder, more aggressive people
dominate our society.

Hill cited an over-assertive
individual as a “Jerry Lewis type,”

~and listed Richard Nixon as

under-assertive.

‘ ‘That’s why Nixon faced so many
problems as president. 2 He had
preconceived notions about how he
should -act and couldn’t be
himself,” Hill explained.

Examples of overaggressiveness
are violence, murder and terrorism.
Hill speciﬁcally referred to unne-
cessary ﬁghting in sports such as
the George Atkinson-Lynn Swann

brawls in recent Oakland Raider-
Pittsburgh Steeler games.

We can all categorize people A

according to which group they fall
into,” said Hill, “but we must
remember that we’re better off if we
belong to all three.

“A basic problem is that many
people are oblivious to what is going
on around them.

An Old Era Rolls Into City

By MARYHALL

Pittsburgh was graced yester-
day by a queen who brought with
her shades of a tranquil past as she
glided smoothly and silently up the
waters of the ,Ohio River to the
Point.

She was the 285 foot long,
1,837-ton Delta Queen, last of the
overnight paddlewheel steamboats,
making her annual stop in
Pittsburgh. And the only thing that
announced her arrival in past trips
has been the occasional drifting of

notes from her calliope up over the -

houses along the Ohio. A
_Built in 1976 in Stockton,
California, the Delta Queen ori-
ginally carried cargo and passen-
gers on an overnight route between
Sacramento and San Francisco-
until World War II when she was
taken over by the Navy to carry
personnel to and from various Navy
ships in the San Francisco Bay.

In 1946, Captain Tom Greene,
president of the Greene Line
Steamers in Cincinnati, bought the
Delta Queen for $46,250 and
launched her on a career that has
given her added years and fame.

been living a lazy migratory life,
moving 10 miles an hour up and
down the Mississippi River, carry-
ing her passengers deep into Mark
Twain country and down to New
Orleans.

Her home port is in Cincinnati,

months in the South, from May
through November she stops in

relaxing days of towns slippingby

EL --They’re Still A Dynamo Onstage

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Untilearly this year, Britain’s
Emerson, Lake and Palmer was one
superstar band that had seemingly
disappeared from the face of the
earth.

Before ELP’s current high gear
swing through America, their last
-tour was in the summer of ’74.
Three entire years is a long time for
musicians to go without playing
before fans who are continually
exposed to new and varied artists.

Even more incredible, until the
release of the “Works Vol. 1'’
album, to coincide with the tour,
ELP’s last studio album was put
out in the fall of 1973.

Why the long period of inac-

tivity? Laziness? Boredom with
recording and touring? Indif-
ference?

The band hasn’t answered those
questions, but insiders say that
keyboard wizard Keith Emerson
was just not in the mood to play
publically. Also since the band’s
six albums have turned platinum
and sellouts were the rule on their
world tours, the band had the good
fortune and money, to disappear.

ELP appeared in Pittsburgh’s
Civic Arena last'Saturday night
before a fanatical crowd that was
yet well mannered and musically
knowledgeable. It was the band’s
first appearance here in over three
years. A There were: no signs of
rustiness, however, in the band’s
classically structured, 13 song set
of progressive, highly sophisticated
rock music.

‘ Keith Emerson ought to be able
to play a synthesizer. He was the
musician who ﬁrst used it on his
album six years ago. _

Emerson, like his compadres,

Greg Lake on vocals/bass/ acoustic
guitar and Carl Palmer on assorted
percussion, deserve to be placed
into the master musicians category.

On “Karn Evil 9 Second
Impression,” “Tarkus,” “Pictures
at an Exhibition,” “Knife’s

Edge,” “Pirates” and “Fanfare
For the Common Man” Emerson,
displayed a flashy and ﬁery style of
play on his wall of synthesizers.

During the “Nutrocker,” he
switched to the grand piano and
played some of the snappiest
ragtime this side of Eubie Blake.
On “Take a Pebble” he continued
to amaze, playing the acoustic
piano with ease, in a style that
created moods that would spin the
heads of most concert pianists.

Lake is primarily known for his
superb bass playing, which is so
important to ELP’s complex ori-
ginal works and interpretations of
great 20th century composers’
works, such as Aaron Copeland’s
“Fanfare for the Common Man”
and “Hoedown,” plus the Mug-
gursky inspired, “Pictures at an
Exhibition.” ‘

But, all too often, Lake’s ability

as a vocalist is overlooked. Lake’s‘

rich, full timbered voice produced a
distinctive singing style that
commanded the attention of the

Arena audience with its simple‘

beauty. c

You Turn Me On,” “Ces’ Luve,”

rang through the silent Arena,
creating rare musical moments.

Palmer. at the present time, is
perhaps the most knowledgeable
and proﬁcient drummer in the
entire world. A claim as lofty as
that can be made because of his
versatility and ability on all forms
of percussion. making it a highly
specialized art form.

Whether it was the standard kit,
tympanies, gongs, bells, vibes or
chimes, Palmer’s dedication to his

instrument was evident in his

playing.

In addition to ELP’s unques-
tioned musicianship, the band
created some stunning visual
effects.

Two cannons on top of the
suspended speakers, were fired
during one of the weaker numbers,
“Pirates.” Palmer’s unbelievably
fast, powerhouse drum solo on
“Tank” was highlighted when his
drum platform spun around,
revealing ﬁre-breathing English
grifﬁns on the back of two gigantic
gongs.

And it was Emerson who got the
last hurrah on the encore, “Fanfare
For A Common Man.” During the
brutal synthesizer bridges in the
middle of the song, Emerson

jumped over his organ. Then he

started to jockey it around stage.
Then he kicked it. Then he fell
under it. as if making love to it.
The crowd loved it. and Emerson
did it without missing a lick.

Much of the hype that .was
generated for Emerson, Lake and
Palmer’s current tour had to do
with the band’s‘ insistence on
bringing along a full 70-piece
orchestra and choir. though the
possible consequence is ﬁnancial
suicide.

Although no official announce-
ment was made giving the reason.
the orchestra andchoir were not a
part of Saturday night’s show.

But it didn’t really matter.
People came to see ELP who
individually and collectively proved
that they are three of the last
decade's finest musicians and
performers. ‘

Next time you get a chance. go
and see their show. It’s a dynamo.

Gable And Leigh
Hit The Bookshelves

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Long Live the King
By Lyn Tornabene
Doubleday

In this, the year the classic ‘ ‘Gone
With The Wind” ran on television
and a sequel is in the works for the
big screen, it seems only ﬁtting that
there are a rash of books on the
market about Rhett Butler himself
—Clark, Gable.

Lyn T ornabene’s ‘ ‘Long Live The
King” is the best of the lot. She
skillfully avoids the slick Rona
Barrettish prose that ruins most
biographies of film greats, tracing
Gable’s life and loves with wit and
style. - .

It’s all too obvious that Torna-
bene is a big fan of Carole Lombard,
Gable’s third wife (he had ﬁve in all)
—the chapter dealing with their
courtship and marriage is the
book’s best. Similarly, Tomabene’s
dislike for wife number four, Lady

' Sylvia Ashley, colors that chapter

and it’s almost as good as the one
about Lombard. ,
At any rate, “long Live The

King” is loaded with amusing‘

incidents like Lombard ﬁxing a
dummy‘ to keep Gable occupied
while she went to sell war bonds,
Gable’s total lack of vanity in
removing his false teeth wherever
and whenever he felt like it and
Lombard ﬁlling Gable’s hotel room
with live doves to make peace after
an argument. And there's enough

Vivien Leigh: A Biography
By Anne Edwards
Simon and Schuster

The life of Gable’s “Gone With
The Wind” costar, Vivien Leigh,
makes for an altogether different
type of biography. While the
two-time Oscar winning actress (for
“Gone‘With The Wind” and “A

Streetcar Named Desire”) and
'one-time wife of _Sir Lawrence

Olivier lacked neither looks not
talent, she was badgered by almost
constant illness and was diagnosed
as a manic depressive in the latter
part of her career.

Anne Edwards’ book is a candid
and sympathetic look at Vivien
Leigh. Edwards, coincidently, is
working on the screenplay of the
“Gone With The Wind” sequel.

Hill Leaves; Schedule Out

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

Pitt basketball coach Tim
Grgurich has gained a home-heavy
schedule for next season, but lost
an assistant basketball coach to
Kansas.

Assistant basketball coach Bob
Hill, who did much of Grgurich’s
recruiting legwork during the past

two years, has resigned his position .

to take a position as top assistant to
Kansas coach Ted Owens.

Hill, 27, came to Pitt when
Grgurich. who served as Buzz
Ridl’s recruiting chief until Ridl’s
retirement, was named Pitt’s head
coach. Grgurich reportedly has
begun searching for a new
assistant, though no candidates
have been named.

While attempting to replace Hill,
Grurich can look forward to a
1977-78 schedule that includes 13
home games and two tournaments.
Among the newcomers to Pitt’s
agenda are Morris Harvey. Evans-
ville, San Diego. Canisius and
Robert Morris. Of such lineups are
good seasons made.

After three season-opening
games at home (Morris Harvey
Nov. 26, West Virginia Wesleyan
Nov. 30 and Kent State Dec. 3), the
Panthers will spend a month on the
road, followed by almost one month
at home.

Pitt will take on the Athletes-in-
Action squad Dec. 17 at the Field
House, then, after an open date,
travel to the San Diego touma-
ment. Joining Pitt in the San Diego
field will be Fordham, Purdue and
san Diego.

Pitt’s first “Eastern Eight"
competition will come Jan. 4 when

and Robert Morris. a miniscule
Pittsburgh school that has at-
tempted to make a successful
transition from small-time to
major-college basketball. This
game apparently is Grgurich’s
make-good on a pledge he made to
increase the stature of Pittsburgh
college basketball. That effort was
hurt when its two best players
recently were found to be scholas-
tically ineligible.

said.

Chengery said the company has
built a second steamboat, the
Mississippi Queen, that meets
government regulations, in case the
Delta Queen must be retired. The
new boat is the heaviest riverboat
ever built and the ﬁrst one built

solely for passengers (and not L

frei ht).
hengery said the Mississippi
Queen has many modern conven-
iences the Delta Queen lacks, such
as individual thermostat control and
hot and cold running water in the
staterooms. He describes her as
“comparable to a modem-day
cruise ship——say, on the Caribbean
—with paddlewheel propulsion.”
Chengery’s heart-belongs to the
aging Delta Queen, however, whose
brass, Oregon cedar, walnut and
mahogany gently pull her passen-
gers back through the years with
rich colors and scents, as well as
carrying them peacefully along the
Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.
