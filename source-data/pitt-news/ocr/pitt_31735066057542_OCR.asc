CWO debates campus security

By Chris Kocher
Staff Writer

In its continuing attempt to improve campus
safety, Campus Women’s Organization is peti-
tioning Public Safety to move the late-night
entrance to the Cathedral of Learning, said CWO
co-president Scott Dolin at its meeting Thursday.

Dolin wrote a letter to Director of Public Safety
Rick Boyd, which was read at the meeting. The
letter requested that access be moved from the
Fifth Avenue side to the Bigelow Avenue side of
the Cathedral.

“Our members who live on campus and com-
muter students feel that this change will cut down
on the amount of night walking that must be done
from the Cathedral to either a residence hall or a
parked car,” the letter said. -

Boyd’s written response, also read at the meet-
ing, gave three reasons why he could not recom-
mend the change.

Two of these reasons were a campus emer-
gency phone and a buzzer to summon security
which are installed on the Fifth Avenue side but
not on the Bigelow Avenue side.

The third reason Boyd gave was that “users of
the building have become accustomed to entering
and leaving via the Fifth Avenue door. To change
the established routine would create unnecessary
confusion and consternation.”

Boyd said he feels increased lighting around
the Cathedral decreases the risk of problems.

Dolin and CWO co-president Stephanie
Sudzina questioned these reasons, wondering if a
buzzer or campus phone couldn’t be installed at
the Bigelow entrance.

Dolin also speculated about the escort service
that is supposed to start on a trial basis next term.

“We don’t understand how it’s going to be
done,” Dolin said. “That takes a lot of planning.
You need to train volunteers and things like that.
It’s just a huge concern that they’re going to put it
together really sloppily, say, ‘It didn’t work,’ put
it down and never try it again.”

In other business, Sudzina announced she was
invited to form a committee to help select the
next director of the women’s studies program.

“This panel will probably have a very big influ-
ence on who the next director of the women’s

Greeks
elect new
leaders

By Erica Glasspool
Staff Writer

The Greeks expressed desires
for changes in public relations
and risk management as their
own Executive Board positions
changed hands.

On Tuesday night the
Interfraternity Council and
Panhellenic Association held
their Executive Board elections
for next year.

Both president—elects, Kara
Appel for Panhel and Doug
Siegel for IFC, discussed
improving communication
among their members.

Siegel plans on improving
communications between IFC
members via bulletin boards,
more roundtables and E-mail
hook—ups in every house.

Appel plans on having more
seminars pertaining to concerns
that Panhel would like to be
educated on.

. “Communication is the main
thing. I want to know what
Panhel wants the executive
board to do for them,”
Appel.

Treasurer-elect for Panhel
Alison Brett wants to establish a
Greek forum open not only to
all Greeks, but also to the uni-
versity and general public.
Different topics that are perti-
nent at the time will be dis-
cussed.

Along with improving com-
munication, Siegel wants to stop
a possible deferred rush.

The University of Pittsburgh
and the Greeks are conducting a
two—year study on whether or

not it is beneficial to postpone ‘

rushing and pledging for fresh-
men until their second semester
of school.

Despite popular stereotypes Campus.

about “Generation X,” there is
hope for the future of young
Americans.

At least that is the opinion of
Paul Loeb, who has spent the
past seven years researching
college students’ daily lives
and trying to get a closer look
at the generation whose mem-
bers have been branded with
the now-familiar term “slack-
ers.”

Loeb, a Seattle—based inves-
tigative reporter and author,
reports his findings in his new

Since 1987, Loeb has visited
over 100 college campuses in
North America, attending
classes with students, stopping
by their dorms, sitting in on
their activities, meetings and
demonstrations and following
them through their first few
years of post-graduate lives.

According to Loeb, the “it’s
not my fault” attitude of the
older baby-boom generation
has led to a great deal of disil-
lusionment among today’s
youth.

of scapegoating going on,”
said Loeb, who was in
Pittsburgh two weeks ago to
talk about his research. “This
country is [having] serious
problems, and we’re looking
for people to blame. It’s sort of
a psychological thing where 
people aren’t taking responsi-
bility for the real issues.”
Thirty years ago, college
degrees generally guaranteed
students jobs after they got out
of school. This is not so much

I the case today, and Loeb said

this aspect of reality tends to
depress students.
‘‘I thinkthe economic stuff

really does weigh down on
student_s pretty heavily.
Compared to 30 years ago,
they’re working a lot more
outside hours in jobs to sur-
vive, and they’re going into
debt a lot more,” Loeb said.

“When you come out [of
college] with this weight on
your back, it’s going to shape
your choices,” he said. “It’s
going to make it hard for you
to do what you want.”

-Sometimes, according to
Loeb, people just can’t do
what they want, and opt
instead for doing whatever
they can to survive.

The voyage continues
Semester at Sea students dock and visit sites in Japan, China

(Tony Fiorini is a Pitt junior on
Semester at Sea )

;HONG KONG — As we neared

Japan, everyone on the ship got excit-
ed. Imagine being locked in the
Cathedral, eating, sleeping and taking
classes there for two weeks. That’s
what being on the ship felt like, and
that’s why everyone wanted to get off.

Most of the students on board were
up on the observation deck, watching
the tug boats maneuver us into a spot
at the dock. To our amazement, there
was a marching band there to greet us.
They played a few popular American
tunes.

The first people on board were the
Japanese immigration officials. They
went through each individual passport
“clearing” the ship. This process took
about two hours, in ‘which time mail
was brought on the ship.

I got off the ship and met my host
student, Ya Sushi, who took me back
to his house to spend the night and
show me around Osuka the next day.
We took the train to his house and
arrived around midnight. Both his par-
ents were up and waiting for us.
Dinner was on the table, and we sat
down to"eat. .

We talked, and before I knew it, it
was 3 a.m. I went to sleep on the floor,
on a floormat. After a shower and
breakfast, we went to see the sights.

First we went up to Osuka castle, a
15th century castle that housed Seuri
Lords. My most memorable experi-
ence in Japan occurred in the court-
yard at the castle.

I went over to a food stand where
there were 50 or 60 school children
gathered to buy a drink. Yasushi could
hear what they were saying and said to
me, “You are the first foreigner they
have ever seen.” Five or six of the
young girls asked to have their picture
taken with me by pointing to me, and
then pointing to their camera. I, of
course, told Yasushi to tell them
“yes,” and the girls lined up in front of
me and had their teacher take the pic-
ture. After they were done, they said
“thank you” and walked away.

Later that day we went shopping
and ate lunch out. Yasushi had to go
home, so he took me back to the Port
Terminal, all too soon for me. We
exchanged addresses, and I got back
on the ship.

l

Seeste at Sea students visit te Great Wall of hina, one of only tw

with the naked eye.

I had until 4 p.m. the next day in

Kobe, time I had to use wisely. I went
out with two other friends to explore
the city. We walked around, went to a
shrine, went shopping and ate lunch.
We got back to the ship at 3 p.m., an
hour before departure.
g I wanted to call home, the first time
in two and a half weeks. It was 2 a.m.
when I woke my parents up. I assured
them I was still alive, and everything
was OK. They were glad to hear from
me. I got an update on everything that
was happening back home.

We were about to leave, so I had to
get back on the ship. Two days is not
enough time to see Japan. I don’t
think two months would be long
enough.

The thing that struck me most about
the Japanese was how nice they were.
You could ask someone on the street
how to get somewhere, and, more than
likely, he or she would take you there,
sometimes talking an hour or two to
do it. Crime is also very low in Japan.
I didn’t see any police while I was

   

\

there. If you went a day without see-
ing a police officer at Pitt, it would be
a miracle.

We only have three days at sea
between Japan and Hong Kong, a
much nicer sail than the Pacific cross-
ing. I am going to Beijing in China.

something I am looking forward to.

MANILA, Philippines —— I was full
of anticipation as the ship was tied to
the dock at Hong Kong. I knew in 12
hours I would be in Communist
China, a place few Americans ever get
to go. First, about Hong Kong, due to
the trip to China, I had to make the
most of the little time I had in Hong
Kong. ~

The city reminded me very much of
New York City, tall buildings every-
where, cabs and people moving
throughout the streets. I went to
Stanley Market, an area where street
vendors gather to sell just about any-
thing from clothes to art to radios.

It was a fairly uneventful evening in
Hong Kong, except for one thing —

traffic. The steering wheel is on the
right side of the car, and they drive on
the left side of the street, just like the
British, completely opposite of
America. I can’t tell you how many
times I was almost hit by cars and
buses. _

The next morning, I was on a plane
bound for Beijing, China. I was going
to be meeting with students from the
University of International Business
and Economics.

There were about 50 other Semester
at Sea students in my group, and we
were taken to a hotel near the univer-
sity. The place was not great, no pool
or weight room, in fact we were lucky
to have our own bathrooms. That
night we went to UIBE to talk with
students.

Some of the students had been
studying English since grade school,
and it showed. Some of them spoke
better than people I know back home.

”Schincller's List” author
Keneally to speak at Pitt

By Mark Gordon
News/lssistant
A year ago, around

Christmas, movie audiences
were introduced to Oscar
Schindler, a man who rescued
over 1,200 Jews from certain
death in the Holocaust.

-Steven Spielberg brought the
story of Schindler to movie the-
aters with the release of
“Schindler’s List,” but it would
not have been possible without
Thomas Keneally, who will be
speaking at Pitt on Nov. 30.

Keneally is the author of
“Schindler’s List,” a novel he
wrote in 1982 after he first
heard the story of Schindler’s
heroics_in a Beverly Hills lug-
gage store.

He is coming to Pitt as part of
the Pitt Program Council
Lecture Series, according to
PPC member John Burbea.

“It is more than a lecture,”
Burbea said. “There will be a lot
of information about the
Holocaust at the lecture.”

Burbea also said PPC will be
showing the film “Schindler’s
List” on Dec. 1 in the William
Pitt Union, which will be free to
anyone who has a ticket to the
lecture.

Keneally, who will be speak-

ing at 8:30 p.m. in the WPU -

Assembly Room, has published
more than 25 novels and has

won four awards for his work.
Keneally was inducted into the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences in October of 1993,
according to Burbea.

Keneally was attracted to the
story of Schindler because he
was the “antithesis of our tradi-
tional view of the one—di»men—
sional altruistic character,”
according to Jane Keneally.

Schindler was a womanizer,
was involved in the Gerrnany’s
black market and was someone
who needed war to survive,
according to Jane Keneally. He
made “millions through his
dealings with the German Army
 yet he spent millions bribing
Reich Officials to keep Jews
under safe care from the Nazis.”

Keneally would not have
known about Schindler if he
was not using an Australian
credit card at the luggage store
in Beverly Hills. The transaction
needed a telephone approval
that took 20 minutes. In that
time the owner of the store,
Leopold Page, told Keneally of
when he was Poldek Pfefferberg
during the Holocaust and he
worked for Schindler. Keneally
used that story to get him started
on “Schindler’s List.”

Tickets for the lecture are now
on sale at the PPC ticket office,
Burbea said. Tickets are $5 for
Pitt students with a valid ID and
$12 for all others.

studies program will be,” Sudzina said.
She invited anyone who has taken women’s
studies classes to talk with her about joining the

committee.

Mark Headings, co-president of the Squirrel
Hill chapter of National Organization for Women,
urged members to contact their Pennsylvania rep-
resentatives and tell them to vote for House Bill
160, which will make acquaintance rape without

a weapon a felony offense.

The bill was prompted by a recent
Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling involving a

The Pitt News, Monday, November 21, 1994

 

college student who was raped. The justices ruled

that the woman, who/ repeatedly said no to her
attacker but did not physically resist him, was not
raped, according to Headings.

Headings also

said that members were invited to help the

Squirrel Hill NOW, along with other groups in
the area, to organize a rally in support of the Roe
v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion.

The rally will be held around Jan. 22, the
anniversary of the decision, Headings said. ‘

Also, Dolin said CWO will try to organize a

food and clothing drive after Thanksgiving break
but that all the details had not been worked out.

and do nothing. We must create,
provide and implement pro-
grams that will help improve
our grades from day one,” said
Siegel of the two-year study on
deferred rush.

Vice-President for Member
Education-elect Mike Costanzo
wants to focus on getting
together a roundtable of alumni
to discuss current scholarship
policy.

He would like to create a
standing IFC scholarship com-
mittee to address development
and implementation of utilizing
university resources. Topics
such as test-taking skills and
time management would be
addressed.

Costanzo would also like to
provide the Greek community
with practical solutions to possi-
ble scenarios in risk manage-
ment “instead of just giving out

information.”

“We need practical solutions
on things like how to plan a fire
evacuation of a whole house or
deal with a drunken and bel-
ligerent person during a social
function,” said Costanzo.

George Raudenbush, vice-
president for administration-
elect, talked about risk manage-
ment improvement. He said that
IFC needs to pay more attention
to overall risk management poli-
cy.

“Risk management needs to
bleed out into other elements of
IFC like member education and
pledge training,” said
Raudenbush.

A top priority for both IFC
and Panhel was public relations.

“We do far and away more
positive things for this campus
than any other group. We need
to alter public perception and
create public awareness,” said
Raudenbush.

More coverage of the positive
things the Greeks do would fur-
ther standings between the IFC
and the community while bene-
fiting rush,“ said Cyrus
Zolghadri, vice-president-elect
for membership recruitment.

Putting together an informa-
tion package outlining rules,
dates and times among other
things to improve intramural
sports was one of Vice-
President-elect for Programs

Chris Fedeli’s focuses.

Just setting up an Athletic
chair to get intramural sports
started for Panhel was the inter-
est of Kristi Stein, external

 "The'Pitt News, Monday, November 21, 1994

-From page 1

In his book, Loeb points to
the case of a student from
Nebraska who enjoyed work-
ing on the farm where he grew
up. However, the student rec-
ognized that, because huge
agriculture and chemical com-
panies had been buying large
amounts of land, farming had
no potential for economic
growth.

Eventually, despite his love
and dedication to farming, the
student had accepted an intern-
ship with one of the large
chemical companies. Though
at one time he protested
against the companies which
drove farmers off their land, he
became part of one of them
because he felt he couldn’t
afford to follow through with
his dream and simply gave up
on it.

“I just felt like it was sad
because this was a real good
guy,” Loeb said. -“It was a real
resignation of his own beliefs
and hopes that says, ‘Here’s
what I believe, but I can’t real-
ly afford to follow it out.”’ .

Loeb said another problem
facing young Americans is
their own feeling that they do
not know enough about a
given cause to act on it.

This “perfect standard,” as
Loeb called it, leads to feelings
of inferiority and self-doubt,
and stops some students from
taking active stands on impor-
tant issues and in their commu-
nities.

“There are some really pow-
erful young voices that are
coming out,” Loeb said, “but I
think a lot of people get boxed
in. They just don’t feel they

have the latitude to act.”

“It’s kind of a dilemma
because, on the one hand, it’s
very understandable why a lot
of students just feel they don’t
have time to act,” he said. “But
if they don’t, they’re likely to
get screwed by the changes in
society that aren’t madewith
their interests in mind.”

However, Loeb said it
doesn’t necessarily take per-
fect knowledge to get involved
with a given cause, just desire
and dedication.

He said the amount of work
put into the civil rights move-
ment in the 1960s and the fight
for women’s suffrage in the
early 20th century shows that
great changes can be accom-
plished with hard work and
perseverance. '

“It’s going to be hard, but
it’s not impossible because
these things [in the past]
looked absolutely immovable,
and somehow people did it,”
he said.

Loeb said one__of the main
challenges facing the future of
“Generation X” is whether
people who are already taking
active stands to get others to
fight for what they believe in.

“We really have some choic-
es in this country about
whether we’re going to look
squarely at our problems,”
Loeb said. “You feel like you
can’t afford a house, you can’t
afford to raise kids, you’re
afraid to walk on the streets
because people are desperate.”

“Either we address that, or it
really makes things harder for
the nation,” Loeb said.
“Whether that happens, we’ll
see. I hope it does.”

They were very curious
about America and wanted to
talk about everything from
President Clinton to sports to
music. They seemed to
know a lot about the United
States, but only what the gov-
ernment wanted them to
know. It was hard to explain
some things to them -— they
just didn’t understand,
because they don’t really
know what the United States
is all about.

After the formal meeting, I
went back to one of the stu-
dents’ rooms. It was a small
square room with four sets of
bunk beds. There were seven
people living in the room, and
there was one desk in the mid-
dle. There was one closet,
leaving a very small amount
of storage for one person, let
alone seven. Think about that
the next time you complain
about the Towers.

The next day we went to
Tien An Men Square and the
Forbidden City. Both of these
beautiful sights are located in
the middle of Beijing, a city
that was not quite what I

expected. The smog was terri-
ble, mostly because they use
coal for all their cooking and
industrial needs.

Also, you cannot spend any
time in Beijing without notic-
ing the bicycles. I mean hun-
dreds of thousands of bicycles
—— everywhere. The streets
had a divider in them; one
side was for cars and the other
for bikes.

The next day we went to the
Great Wall of China and the
Summer Palace. Of all the
places we have been so far, I
liked the Great Wall the best.
It is two hours north of
Beijing.

The air is much cleaner up
there, and for the first time on
the trip, there was a chill in
the air. Up until then, the tem-
perature hadn’t been below
75°. The leaves were chang-
ing color,’ and I could smell
autumn in the air. It reminded
me of home. A

I walked past all the tourist
traps, the “get your picture on
a camel next to the Wall”
booth and up to the gate.
There was an endless supply
of people wanting to sell you

things. They had key chains,
postcards and even a lighter
with a picture of Chairman
Mao on it that played the
Chinese national anthem
when you opened it.

The guide said, “You can go
to the left or to the right, but
the left is harder, and you get
a better view.” As a photogra-
pher, I had to go for the better’
view, and how hard could it
be?

Vertical is a good way to
describe the slope, at its
worst, each step was eight
inches deep, and 18 inches
high. I was breathing heavy
after the climb, only to see
some Chinese four times my
age right along with me. I sat
on the edge of the wall, think-
ing how lucky I was to be”
there. In the distance, I could
see the Wall meet the sky,

only to know over the horizon ’

lay thousands of miles more.
I learned more about China
and life in general in three

days in Beijing than 1 did in 
years. 
Meeting and talking with peo- A‘

my 20 previous

ple provides insight beyond
any book.

you can use IRC for something other than wast-

All in all, IRC is a great place to meet new ,

Opinions
24-hour labs

Have a paper due? It’s going to be a late night, right? Well,
maybe not if you don't have your own computer. Late night access
to university computers is limited for Pitt students. The Benedum
computer lab is the only one open 24 hours, but that is only on
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Sutherland’s computer lab

.. is open in the wee hours of the morning, but also only on week-

days. If a student wants to write a paper late at night on the week-
end, such as Sunday night for a Monday due date, then they had
better have their own computer. Between 2 a.m. Sunday night
(actually Monday morning) and 8 a.m. the next morning, students
have no access to university computers.

The least the university can do is provide more than one 24-hour
computer lab and provide all-night access on Sunday nights. Yes,
we know that the university shuts down the entire system from 2
a.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday night/Monday morning, but why could this
not be done on Saturday night — no one will have a paper due on

E ~ Sunday. Many other universities have 24-hour libraries and com-

puter access. Pitt should provide this convenience for its students.
One may rebut this argument by saying students should not be
waiting to the last riiinute to write their papers and should be more
diligent. Well, that may be nice for the diligent people of the
world, but speaking from personal knowledge, some of the best
papers have been written the night or morning before its due.

' Also, for the night owls of this university, 3 a.m. is often a much

more convenient time to work ahead than 3 p.m. Pitt should at
least’ have the David Lawrence and Sutherland, as well as
Benedum, computer labs open 24 hours including Sunday night.

Helms out of lime

Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N'.C.) crossed the line last Friday. On
CNN he stated his opinion that President Clinton was not “up to
the job” of commander in chief, but also added that “neither do
the people in the armed forces.” The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff Gen. John Shalikashvili quickly responded to Helms’
allegations. Seeking out journalists, Shalikashvili defended
Clinton, saying Helms’ allegations were inaccurate, that “nothing
could be further from the truth” and generally gave the president a

‘ , vote of confidence.

The Pitt News applauds the quick actions of Gen. Shalikashvili,
defending Clinton, and we believe Helms’ comments were out of
line and poorly timed. Sen. Helms is certainly allowed his own
opinion, but to insinuate, only on the basis of a few letters, that
the armed services do not have faith in the abilities of their com-
mander in chief is wholly inappropriate. 8

Furthermore, since the huge Republican victory in the recent
election, there has been a general spirit of bipartisanship between
the president and Republican leaders of Congress. This will hope-
fully lead to progress rather than stagnation in the next Congress.
For Helms to put this spirit of cooperation in jeopardy with his ill-
timed attack of Clinton is foolhardiness and shows his lack of
respect for the good of the nation rather than his ownagenda.

Alcohol

Once again I find myself
looking over yet another sad
story about someone who dis-
covered the bad side of alcohol.
I am referring to the death of
Atif Bhatti, due to alcohol
intoxication. The life of a seri-
ous, dedicated student with a
very bright future gone forever.
Why? Why did he decide to go
out drinking on his 21st birth-
day? Why did his “friends” let
him drink so much? Why did
the bar serve him so much after
he was obviously intoxicated?
Why did his fraternity brothers
leave him on that couch when
he was in such bad condition?
Why was it four hours before
anyone checked on him?

The only way I can hope to
understand any of this is to look
at the atmosphere of a fraternity
house. Currently, in many fra-
ternity houses, alcohol is the
one binding, overshadowing
force. The pressure to drink is
immense. If you do not drink,
you are an outcast. This is due

largely to the ‘fact that without 7

alcohol, most frats would lose
their ability to attract and keep
members. According to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Atif
Bhatti expressed to his father
the desire to move out of the
Delta Sigma Phi house because
he didn’t like the drinking he
observed. He said he would
consider leaving next semester,
but until then reasoned, “I have
my own room, so I can shut the
door” when the others’ behav-
ior bothered him. Obviously,
the door wasn’t enough.

This is not an isolated inci-
dent here at Pitt. As many stu-
dents will eventually die of
alcohol-related causes as will
eventually get their master’s
and doctorate degrees com-
bined. It has been proven that
people who do not drink do not
suffer from alcohol induced
sickness and deaths, other than

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

at the hands of drinkers. I am
not in the position to tell people
not to drink. However, I can ask
that you think before you drink.
Make sure you have a way to
get home and a responsible
friend with you at all times. Do
not drive if you are even possi-
bly intoxicated. Find out what

alcohol really does to the

human body. Consider doing
something new next Friday
night — consider staying dry.

Michael Kaizer
President, Student Anti-
Alcohol Movement

Greeks

Being students at this univer-
sity we have a very positive
image of both this school and
the Greek system of which we
are involved. However, we
have been discouraged over the
last few weeks about how cer-
tain students and the university
(i.e. The Pitt News) has por-
trayed us. To characterize fra-
ternities as “[people] paying all
this money and not getting a
whole lot in return,” according
to ,Michael Kaizer, is
ABSURD. Obviously, Michael,
you have never been involved
with a fraternity and have no
clue what you are talking about.
Your ignorance is amusing
though! So to all ignorant stu-
dents we are here to educate
you, pay attention. A

Firstly, while alcohol and sex
play a factor in college, they're
not limited to fraternities. We
all know that students can go to
local bars or. off-campus parties
and experience the same atmos-
phere. Also Michael, to say that
“women are encouraged to
come to these parties.
Sometimes obviously, other
times not, the women are set up
so they cannot avoid having
sex” staitles _me. Can not avoid
having sex? We think you
underestimate the majority of

ladies that attend these parties.

In addition, to portray the
Greek system as merely a social
group shows an obvious misun-
derstanding of what the Greek
system is all about. Let us tell
some positive aspects about
being Greek. From a national
standpoint: “Approximately 80
percent of the executives of the
500 largest corporations are fra-
ternity men. More then three-
fourths of our U.S. Senators are
fraternity men — as are a
majority of men listed in Who’s
Who in America. Of the 17
U.S. Presidents who had a
chance to join a" fraternity, 14
took advantage of the opportu-
nity ...” This is according to
research done by Dr. Frederick
D. Kershner Jr. Some other
examples include our presti-
gious Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor as well as members
of the board of trustees.

Many positive aspects of
Greek life are apparent on this
campus. For an organization
that represents only 11 percent

. of this university, we excel in

almost all-aspects of student
involvement. Last year alone
we raised some $102,000 for
Special Olympics.
Cumulatively we have raised
over 1 million dollars over the
last 10 years for various chari-
ties, enhancing the University
of Pittsburgh, we alone have
saved thousands of lives each
year. That aside, we also_repre-
sent the majority of leaders on
this campus. Five of the last six
SGB presidents have been
Greek, including our next. A
majority of the board is also
Greek. Greeks care about this
university and have shown it
repeatedly. Instead of criticizing
us, try to respect what we repre-
sent and what we do to make
this university the best we can
make it.

'tt foot-

ended

 

their season
with a 35-21
win over
Rutgers
Saturday,

. , making their
Columnist record, 3-3,
Matt identical to last
Identical, that is, until you look
a little deeper.

Talk to any of the senior play-

ers, and you’ll hear one year has
made a world of difference.

“Last year we had three wins,
but many of our losses were
clobberings,” senior defensive
end Tom Barndt said.

He pointed to this year’s loss-
es against Texas, Louisville,
West Virginia and Miami as
proof of improvement.

“We went into the fourth
quarter playing them close, one
big play in each of those games
and we could’ve been 7-4 and
heading to a bowl,” Bamdt said.
“You couldn’t say that last
year.”

Barndt was one of several
seniors who made sure on
Saturday their impact on the
rebuilding of Pitt football won’t
soon be forgotten.

Named a tri-captain of the
team by head coach John
Majors last week, Bamdt helped
lead a defense which prevented
Rutgers from entering Pitt terri-
tory until the middle of the sec-
ond quarter and knocked the
Scarlet Knights back for losses
on several key downs later in
the game.

But nobody can deny that if
this senior day belonged to any-
body, it was receiver Billy
Davis. Davis caught 10 passes
on the day and tied a Pitt record
with four touchdowns in a sin-
gle game.

He finished with 135 yards
and a place in history as third-
highest on Pitt’s career recep-
tion list and ﬁfth in career
receiving yardage.

“This is a team that is going
to win a lot of games in the
future,” Davis said, reﬂecting
on the team’s improvement over
the last several games.

Senior receiver Chad Askew
also had a solid day, with a 50-
yard reception and a two-point
conversion.

Majors said the improvement
over the last third of the season
may have been the best he’s
ever seen, but admitted the team
will definitely miss the seniors.

“I’m happy [about this win]
for the entire football team and
staff, but I’m double happy for
the seniors. They really deserve
it,” Majors said. When asked
about next year, Majors imme-
diately talked about the senior

Panthers’ wash

Pitt ends season with 35-21 win over Rutgers

By Brady Slater
Senior Staff Writer

' The Panthers continued to add - 

sugar to a season seemingly gone
sour by beating Rutgers 35-21
with Billy clubs Saturday at Pitt
Stadium.

Billy West carried 30 times for
188 yards and
a touchdown,
and wideout
Billy Davis
caught four
to u c h d o w 11
passes from
quarterback John Ryan.

Pitt ﬁnished the second season
of Johnny Majors’ revival with

 

the same 3-8 record as last year,

but Majors’ rebuilding program
looked in full gear the last three
games.

After beating Temple 45-19,
the Panthers’ nearly upset ﬁfth-
ranked Miami 17-12 in the
Orange Bowl, and followed that
with Saturday’s Scarlet whup-
ping-  

“Our football team, in my
opinion, has made some of the
best improvement in the last
third of the season than any team
I’ve been around,” Majors said.
“They were not playing for a
championship, not playing for a
bowl game or even a winning
season, because that was down
the drain.”

Leading the recent Panthers’
charge was a revitalized offense
that ran up 461 yards against the
Knights. 

“You can really tell we were
coming together as a total offen-
sive unit. This program is turning
around,” said offensive tackle

Reuben Brown, who was named

to the American Football
Coaches Association’s All-
American team hours before the
kickoff.

Pitt opened the scoring on their
second possession, following a

 

Matt Se n/Staff’ Photographer

Senior WR Billy Davis catches his fourth TD of the game.

Rutgers’ punt that Denorse
Mosley fair caught at the Pitt 20.

Ryan completions of 28 and 17
yards to Davis mixed with
West’s standardly solid rushing
moved the ball to the Knights’
12. That’s where Ryan hooked
up with Davis on a little out pat-
tern for the first quarter’s only
score.

A healthy and ready Curtis
Martin walked the sideline in his
last collegiate game, and looked
on as his successor made a per-

sonal showcase of the ﬁrst quar- ‘

ter.

West carried the ball 12 times
for 97 yards in the first, and
stamped it with a 48-yard gain on
the last play of the quarter. A
Houdini among rushers, some-
how West escaped three waves
of would-be tacklers before

breaking to the outside. He ﬁnal-
ly collapsed, under the weight of
Rutgers’ corner Derek Ward,
who popped the ball from West’s
hands harmlessly out-of-bounds.

“Anybody can run through a
big hole and pick upfour,” West
said of his tackle breaking. “But
you have to go beyond that. You
have to go further than the line
takes you.”

“Billy West has become a
whale of a football player,”
Majors said. “Thank goodness
he’s on our side.”

Martin never appeared in the
game, and Majors said he didn’t
know what it would have taken
for him to put Martin in.

But the momentum of the
West’s gain appeared broken by
the time out between quarters.
Rutgers recouped, and Pitt failed

to capitalize on the drive.

Instead, Rutgers took the Pitt

punt at their own 7 and put
together their ﬁrst scoring drive.
A 16-yard completion from Ray
Lucas to Reggie Funderburk
gave the Knights some breathing
room.
Terrell Willis broke right for 9
yards, followed by a 28-yard
completion over the middle from
Lucas to Marco Battaglia. Lucas
hit Battaglia again for another 9
yards, before Willis burst
through the middle for a 25-yard
gain to the Pitt 5.

The Pitt defense held for a
fourth-and-goal from the 4, but
couldn’t stop Lucas’ quarterback
draw that evened the score at 7-7.

Pitt answered with a com-
manding scoring march. Nine
plays, 73 yards in 2:47, culminat-
ed by Ryan’s 4-yard hitch to
Davis.

Ryan was a perfect 4-4 on the
drive, with three passes for first
downs.

“I have tremendous admiration
for John Ryan and what he has
accomplished this year,” Majors
said of last year’s starter Ryan,
who ﬁnished with 14 TD passes
this season after being renamed
the starter just four games ago.

But a busted extra point
attempt turned into a comic rou-
tine when the holder, Ryan,
ﬂipped the ball to stocky kicker
David Merrick, who juked a cou-
ple of Rutgers athletes before
falling short of the goal line. Pitt
led 13-7.

Rutgers took the kick and
drove into Pitt territory with the
aid of a 15-yard pass interference
call against the Panthers. Lucas
hit Funderburk for a nine-yard
gain to the Pitt 39, and found him
again one play later for 29 yards
and a Rutgers score. The point
after try was good, and following
a missed 57-yard field goal

Yesterday’s win was bigger in
more ways than one. Not only
did it catapult the team into the
NCAA’s, but it also kept the
Lady Panthers’ season alive.

5 Not only was it impressive to
knock off Seton Hall because
they were the top seed in the
tournament, but the Lady

 

Panthers beat the Pirates in their
own gym.

“We played with so much
character and so much confi-
dence,” Alvear said. “We just
rallied. We upheld the tradition
that Pitt teams have had. We
took it to teams, and that made a
difference.”

It took Pitt all ﬁve matches to
beat Seton Hall. The scores were
15-11, 13-15, 12-15, 15-11 and
15-10.

Friday’s semifinal match
against UConn was equally dra-
matic as the Lady Panthers won
in four games. The scores were
15-3, 13-15, 15-11 and 17-15.

“UConn is a very tough
team,” Alvear said.

“It was a very, very intense
match and a very draining
match. I am really impressed
with our team, that we could
come back after an emotional
match like that and play emo-
tionally strong. It speaks worlds
about this group. They really
turned a comer.

“I think we are actually peak-
ing,” Alvear said. “I think we
had some ups and some downs
and some tough times. I think
we have finally figured things
out and we are just peaking. I
think it is great.”

Contributing to Pitt’s winning
ways was senior outside hitter
Carrie Thornton, who was
named the tournament’s Most
Valuable Player. Over the two
games, she compiled 34 kills, 43
digs and six blocks.

Three Lady Panthers also
earned All-Big East honors.
Jennie Driscoll has been named
first-team All-Big East
Conference. Driscoll was also a
second-team selection in 1993.

Sarah Mikla and Stephanie
Dufresne were also honored as
second-team All-Big East selec-
tions.

“Driscoll is a competitor and it
is well deserved,” Alvear said.-

“She gets up for matches, and
she has always risen to the occa-
sion in Big East matches, and I

think she has been a leader on
this team.

“I think Sarah Mikla and
Stephanie Dufresne getting sec-
ond team is big. Statistically,
Sarah Mikla was right in there
with anybody, and as a setter,
when you are tied for ﬁrst and
you are leading the conference
in assists and you have the most
blocks of any center in the con-
ference, and you’ve helped lead
your team to a ﬁrst place finish
like Stephanie Dufresne did, all
those kids are very, very deserv-
ing. We were very pleased.”

Now that Pitt has accom-
plished the first part of its pre-
season goal, which was to win
the Big East, they are looking
forward to completing the sec-
ond half, which is to be success-
ful in the NCAA’s and win a few
games.

Right now, the team must sit
and wait to see who and where
they will be playing in the tour-
nament. On Nov. 27, the brack-
ets will be released.

New basketball coach brings winning attitude to Pitt

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Framed with public expecta-
tions, Ralph Willard is a picture
of nervous energy sitting
behind his huge wooden desk.
As he continuously twists his
Western Kentucky “Sweet l6”
ring round his finger, Willard
sees a bigger ring in years. to
come. '

“I think we’ll have the oppor-
tunity to compete for the
national championship,”
Willard said. “I think we can
contend year in and year out.”

It’s the national champi-
onship ring Willard, 48, is after,
as he begins his first season as
the University of Pittsburgh
head basketball coach. He

, replaced Paul Evans last March.

The eight-year Evans reign
grew tired, leaving a lackluster
basketball program. Pitt
Athletic Director Oval Jaynes
turned to Willard to revive the
Panther program.

“We brought him here
because he has had success at
every level he’s been at,”
Jaynes said. “Whether he’s
coaching high school, the
Knicks or at Western Kentucky,
he’s always been successful.”

Willard’s past success is why
the Pitt campus buzzes with
anticipation.

Before Pitt, Willard saved a
faltering Western Kentucky
Hilltopper program. Within a
four—year stint, he built Western
Kentucky into a prominent bas-
ketball power. Willard took
over in l990, leading the
Hilltoppers to a 14-14 mark.
Each year they improved, and
by ‘92 he directed Western
Kentucky to the ﬁnal 16 in the
NCAA Tournament, where the
Hilltoppers upset highly ranked
Seton Hall.

“He did an outstanding job
here,” Western Kentucky
Athletic Director Jim Richards
said. “He came in at a very dif-
ficult time, and within three
years we were in the final 16.

He did a remarkable job.”

Before his arrival at Western
Kentucky, Willard, a native of
Brooklyn, N.Y., spent the ‘89-
’9O season .at the University of
Kentucky as the associate head
coach under good friend Rick
Pitino. Willard also assisted
Pitino with the New York
Knicks for two years.

“Rick and I agree" on every-
thing. I don’t like his out of
bounds plays, and he doesn’t
like mine,” Willard joked.

. He also served as an assistant
coach at Syracuse (‘86-’87),
where the Orangemen

of basketball.”

A firm believer in his prod-
uct, Willard has been selling
Pitt to some of the top high
school recruits from all over the
country. He has already landed
6-foot—3-inch guard Vonteego
Cummings from Thomson, Ga.,
6-6 forward Michael Gill from
Washington, D.C., 6-8 forward
Isaac Hawkins from Baton
Rouge, La., and 6-8
Philadelphia forward Andre
Howard.

Willard’s 1995 recruiting
class ranks among the nation’s

Crean, who has worked under
Willard for five years, said. “He
understands people. He under-
stands what makes each indi-
vidual tick.

“He puts the kids in an
atmosphere where they can
have nothing but success if they
follow his lea .”

Willard understands each
player. Thirty-two minutes of
individual improvement prac-
tice each day enables him to
maximize a player’s full poten-
tial.

“I try to cover every aspect of
the total winning

lost in the NCAA cham-
pionship game to Indiana
on Keith Smart’s last sec-
ond shot.

With that kind of expe-

process,” he said.
“The mental and
physical preparation
for a particular oppo-
nent, and to elevate

rience, several schools
courted him to be their
next head coach.

“We were sorryto lose
Ralph, we tried hard to
keep him here,” Richards
said.

But Willard felt con-
stricted.

“As good as we got at
Western Kentucky, the
conference put limitations
on us,” he said. “I believe
whatever you do, you
want to compete at the
highest level, and the
University of Pittsburgh
has that.”

  
  
 

, playéf’s confidence. I
 have an obligation to
 them in every aspect
, of life to be success-
 ful.”

What Willard
 also brings is a win-
 ning attitude that’s
 contagious to every-
I one around him.

“I think the
 most important thing
' you bring to anything
_ is an attitude,” he
Z said. “We want Pitt
 basketball to be about
' an attitude. An atti-
 tude of emotion, of

Now, Willard is here,
and tabbed by many as the Pitt
basketball savior.

“When I first took the job
here, I said that I didn’t think
any program in the country had
more potential,” he said. “There
are a lot of very positive things
to sell here. We have a great
university, a great city, we have
excellent location in terms of
recruiting the East coast,
Midwest and we can go down
South.

“And the fact is the Big East
is going to be one of the top
two conferences in the country
in a year or so. We’re truly one
of the elite conferences in terms

elite. USA Today listed'Pitt’s as
the second—best class in the
country, and ESPN rated it
fourth. ’
“It could be a solid founda-
tion,” Willard  “When you
build a program, you have to
build it through two or three
classes. We’re laying a very
solid foundation for the future.”
Willard’s biggest recruiting
asset is himself. A number of
recruits have named playing for
him as a reason for coming to
Pitt. I
“He’s a great communicator,
which makes him a great moti-
vator,” assistant coach Tom

pride, of class.”

Willard instills that attitude in
his coaching style. He said he
coaches the way he would like
to play, which is why he has the
label as the total player’s coach.

“I love him as a coach,”
senior Pitt forward Orlando
Antigua said. “I wish I had the
opportunity to have met him
sooner.”

“Ralph was definitely well
liked,” Richards said. “The
players sure respected him and
liked to play for him.”

His fast—paced, hard-pressing,
three—point bombing style is
much like professional play.
Offensively, he basically runs

26 plays, each with the main
goal of getting a shot between
18 to 24 seconds. This utilizes
the three—point shot, and by
good ﬂoor spacing, it allows to
get the ball inside more.

“Our leading scorers at
Western Kentucky, except for
one year, were always big peo-
ple,” he said.

This season so far is no dif-
ferent. In his first game coach-
ing here against Marathon Oil,
Pitt attempted 33 three—pointers
and hit 17 of them. But with all
the raining threes, center Jaime
Peterson was the Panthers’
leading scorer.

It’s no surprise that \V1l1ard’s
high octane attack, which aver-
aged 85 points a game at
Western Kentucky, brings the
most out of the fans, too.

“I believe the game has got to
be exciting to the fans,” Willard
said. “A combination of offense
and defense is going to be
exciting. We pressure you on
both sides of the floor.”

And the fans appreciate his
team’s effort. In Willard’s first
game coaching at Western
Kentucky, the Hilltoppers lost
by 59 points to Georgia and had
about 2,000 fans. “By the end
of the year we were averaging
7,000 people, and the place was
rocking.”

One of the things that made
Willard uncomfortable at
Western Kentucky was when he
stepped into the gym, he would
receive a standing ovation.

“Give the standing ovation to
the  not me.” V

But Willard’s results breed
ovations and expectations. Even
with such high expectations
surrounding, him, the pressure
never gets to Willard. His stan-
dards are always a bit higher.

“I put more pressure on
myself than anybody can put on
me,” he said. ‘‘I have a difficult
.time accepting losing. Nobody

‘wants to win‘ more than I do.”

Losing never has an appeal-
ing ring. Especially to a man
who collects rings for a living.

Aldridge stands alone as Pitt's only point guard

By Keith Pompey
Senior Staff Writer

As a kid growing up in
Jamaica, Queens, N.Y., Andre
“Dre” Aldridge always seemed
to be different.

While all of his friends went to
public high school, he opted to
go to. Holy Cross Catholic High
School.

On Friday nights when his
friends were hanging out,
Aldridge would practice playing
basketball.

Now six years later, Aldridge
is seeing results. He will lead the
Panthers into the 1994-95 bas-
ketball season as Pitt’s starting
point guard, while most of his
friends are locked up in prison.

“My brother Spank [Colin]
made sure I wasn’t on the cor-
ner,” Aldridge said. “He made
sure I was in the house at a cer-
tain time.”

Colin, a talented basketball
player, didn’t want to see his lit-
tle brother make the same mis-
takes he made.

Despite only being five years
older than “Dre,” he was more
like a father figure. While teach-
ing his sibling about life, Colin
would challenge “Dre” on the
court.

“No matter what I told him I

’ did in a game,” Aldridge said,

“he would say it wasn’t good.
That made me work harder to
become better.”

Under his brother’s guidance,
Aldridge terrorized the New
York Catholic league during his
senior year, averaging 25 points
and 10 assists. ‘

After being named Player of
the Year, Aldridge was recruited
by UMass, Temple and South
Carolina, but he accepted a
scholarship to Pitt. A

Under former Pitt coach Paul
Evans, Aldn'dge’s role suddenly
changed. He only played in 10
games in two years, with stu-

dents not even knowing he »

played for the team.

“[Evans] used to tell us if you
do good in practice, you are
going to play in the game,”
Aldridge recalled. “I used to
D[efend] Jerry [McCullough]
hard as hell in practice. I used to
D him the whole practice. I used
to work as hard as I could.
Everybody on the team said I
was working hard. They would
ask him why I didn’t get in the
game. [Evans] would never give
anybody an answer. He would
just tell me, ‘keep being ready to
go in,’ but I would never get a
chance.

“I got really depressed. At one
point, I felt like I didn’t want to
play ball anymore. I thought I
should have gotten more playing

time. So I got real mad. In the
middle of the last season, I really
didn’t want to be here. But I
though about and decided to
help [McCullough] become a
better player, since I wasn’t get-
ting any time.”

Then came a time when help-
ing a friend out wasn’t even
worth staying. Aldridge became
tired of Evans’ mistreatment of
him and his teammates.

“It was like a constant cursing
you out all the time,” he said.
“Off the court he was real cool,
but when he came on the court,
man, I don’t know what hap-
pened. At practice, he was
always putting us down. IfI
would throw a bad pass at prac-
tice, he would say, ‘What the
hell are you doing’ or ‘That’s
that New York shit you are
doing.’ Everythingwas New
York this and New York that. It
seemed like everything he said
to me_was negative. Whenever I
went into his office, everything
was like, ‘Andre, when the hell
are you going to do this or that. ’!

“If he would have stayed I
would have left. When we heard
we were going to get a new
coaching staff, I was like ‘let me
see how practice goes.’ When
the coaching staff came in,
everything they said, coach
Evans said. But when practice
started, I saw results. Coach
Willard makes you feel good
about yourself. He makes the
walk-ons feel just like scholar-
ship players. Everybody is equal.
I am glad I didn’t transfer now.”

Due to a knee injury
McCullough suffered in a pick-
up game, Aldridge will run the
show this season. Although he is
happy to bethe starter, he wishes
it were under different circum-
stances. Aldridge was very much
hoping to play along side of
McCullough this year.

But since McCullough’s injury
leaves him as the only point
guard on the team, he is up to the
challenge.

“All I want to do is help us
win,” he said.

“Everybody is expecting us to
lose since Jerry is out. All I want
to do is run the team. I have to
score a little bit, but most likely I
want to dish the ball out.
Basically, I will be the coach on
the team.”

Aldridge already has the sup-
port of his teammates.

By Jack Becker
Senior Staff Writer

In the four months’ prior to
the first exhibition game, the
Pitt basketball team went
from a team in transition of
both leadership and style to a
team merely in continuous
transit to the hospital.

Two of the Panthers top
players, Jerry McCullough
and Willie Cauley, were lost
for the season with knee
injuries. Chris Gant, Chad
Varga and Mahdi Spruill will
sit out the next few weeks.
Gant and Spruill each have a
stress fracture in their foot
and Varga has a sprained
back. Even Garrick Thomas
and Jason Maile have missed
time in the preseason with
nagging injuries.

“I’ve been waiting for the
ceiling to fall in or the earth-
quake to happen,” Pitt coach
Ralph Willard said.

Good thing for the Panthers
there is only one way to
build when the ceiling col-

‘ lapses.

“To be honest with you
I’ve never seen anything like
this,” assistant coach Tom
Crean said. “I don’t think any
of us have. It’s been jus
incredible.” -

of the team, Willard has

Varga makes the jump to Pih‘

I By Brady Slater

Senior Staff Writer

White men can’t jump?

Anybody who saw Chad Varga
leap over two bodies on his way
to a pretty lean-in dunk at
Midnight Madness knows that

just ain’t true.

“The boy got hops,” Orlando
Antigua said. V

The 6—foot—6—inch Varga’s verti-

cal jump measures 41 inches. But
the junior college transfer isn’t
here to showcase his hops, he’s
here to show he can hoop.

“lt’s fun to watch someone with
great leaping ability get up there,”
Pitt head coach Ralph Willard
said, “but Chad’s got other skills
besides that, that really makes him
valuable. ,

There are a lot of guys that can
jump, but can’t play. He can jump
and play.”

Willard should know. Varga
was Willard’s first signed, sealed
and delivered Pitt recruit.

“I think that’s neat,” Varga said.
“I can see us being right up there
with North Carolina and every-
body else, and I'll say, ‘I was
Ralph Willard’s first recruit.’
That’ll be something special.”

Special because he loves play-
ing for Willard. Varga called it one
of the best experiences of his life.
But it’s one he might not be hav-
ing if Willard had not come to
Pitt.

After being named a third—team
junior college All—American while
at Vmcennes ( Ind.) University last
season, Varga was touted by big
guns Kansas. Wisconsin, Missouri

and Wake Forest. Willard, still
coaching Western Kentucky,
wanted him too. He’d first recruit-
ed Varga out of high school.

“I wanted to go to a bigger con-
ference,” Varga said. “And once
[Willard] came here, there was no
doubt in my mind.”

Willard had a more careful take
on the situation.

“We were just fortunate that he
had a good visit,” he said. “He
liked the school and decided to
come with us.”

Prior to his year at Vincennes,
Varga attended the University of
Richmond, where he redshirted
his freshman season with a broken
foot.

When the Spiders’ head coach
Dick Tanant retired after that‘ sea-
son, Varga said see ya.

“He was the reason I went
there,” Varga said. “My reason for
going there was taken away.”

And instead of sitting out a year
in Division I, he went juco.

Now the versatile Varga brings
his game to the Panthers.

“He’s a big athlete who can
handle the ball and shoot the
three,” Antigua said. “He’s big
enough to body people, so he can
rebound. Also, he’s got extremely
long arms — he can block shots.
He’s a pretty good package.”

A package tailor—made for
Willard’s up-and-down style of
play.

“He’s a real exciting player who
will fit in very well,” Willard said.

Varga likes that he’ll be able to
launch the three, instead of just his
body.

“Coach puts a lot of emphasis

on the three, so I’m able to utilize

a the three in this system,” Varga

said. p

But Varga admitted that his
leaps are the staple of his game.

“It’s a big part of my game,” he
said. “Being able to jump helps
me with rebounding, and getting
down low, it helps me jumping
over people and dunking or what-
ever.”

Growing up in Detroit, where
Varga said there is, “big time
ball,” he honed his skillsiwith
some of the best.

Varga played on a Michigan
AAU team with Chris Webber,
Jalen Rose, Voshon Lenard and
Shawn Respert that won a nation-
al championship.

“I played with that all my life,”
Varga said. ‘”That’s where I grew
up. I always played with those
guys, and Ihad to bring my abili-
ties to another level.”

Varga has three years of eligibil-
ity remaining and looks forward
to helping raise Pitt basketball to
another level.

“I’d love to make it to the ﬁnal
four and win a national champi-
onship,” he said. “I have conﬁ-
dence in the coaches and recruit-
ing and the guys we have now
that eventually we’re going to be
able to do that.” .

If Varga does reach the final
four with the Panthers, it’ll be
with some help from above.

“I don’t know if it’s a matter of
black or white,” Varga said.
“Fortunately, God blessed me
with the ability to jump, so I just
use it.”

Amen.

The Pitt News, Monday, November 21, 1994

Wi||arc|'s new system

team played with seven play-
ers and a walk-on utilizing
the same up-tempo style.
Western Kentucky finished
the season winning 10 of its
final 14 games.

“You take the adversity and
you face it and you either
come out stronger or you
come out the lesser person,”
Crean said.

The Panthers will see plen-
ty of adversity this year with
only eight players on schol-
arship, two walk-ons and a
suited—up manager, Mike
Wernicki, available. But
Willard is seeking help from
the football team, with
Johnny Majors’ approval of
course. /

“We welcome any of them
that want to come out,”
Crean said.

Willard’s system features a
high-octane offense and a
pressure defense. ‘Pitt will
deploy a full—court press
mixed with an occasional
half-court or three-quarters
press. The Panthers want to
create a large portion of their
offense from their defense.

“Our whole staple is defen-
sive pressure for 40 min-
utes,” Crean said. “We don’t
want to let a team come out
and be comfortable with
what they’re doing.”

The Pitt offense is a back-
log of three-point shooting
with a per game goal of 25

shots from behind the stripe.

“That’s a big part of our
offense,” Crean said.

Willard’s system demands
that the players keep the
floor balanced and spread in
order to create open shots on
the perimeter. The system is
also designed to have the ball
entered into the post and
kicked back out again for the
jump shot.

But above all else this style
of play demands versatility
from the players. Almost

every Panther will be asked .

to know two or more posi-
tions. Crean said the coach-
ing staff likes to have all
players able to spot up for a
three-point shot as well as be
able to penetrate and find the
open man.

“You’ve got to be a very,
very well conditioned team
to play this way,” Crean said.
“Especially with the numbers
we have.”

Willard, Crean and assis-
tant Bobby Jones haven’t
decided on a starting lineup,
but with so few players there
isn’t much on which to s_pec—
ulate — whoever is healthy
will play.

One certainty is that junior
Andre Aldridge will man the
most pivotal position on the
floor, point guard. Aldridge,
who averaged only 1.7 points
in 7.7 minutes per game last

Lady Panthers look to o

By Brett Fondrk
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Losing a marquee player is a
substantial blow to any team.
Sometimes it takes two or three
players to fill the role that the
superstar vacated. Coach Kirk
Bruce and the Lady Panthers
will get a firsthand look at how
difficult this task is as they pre-
pare to open the 1995 season
without Jonna Huemerich.

Huemerich, who was three-
time All Big East, was lost to
graduation. She was the tearn’s
leading rebounder and scorer
last year, as she averaged nearly
10 rebounds and 20 points a
contest.

“It’s going to be tough,”_

Bruce said. “She was a district
Kodak All-American. It’s going
to be difficult to replace her.”

Also lost from last year’s 21-
10 squad were Jill Colabrese,
Carolyn Miller and Erin Maloy.
The four seniors accounted for
57 percent of Pitt’s scoring last
season. ’

With the loss of the nucleus
of last year’s squad, the Lady
Panthers were picked to finish
seventh in the Big East presea-
son coaches poll.

“I don’t put a lot of stock in
that,” Bruce said. “The only
thing that matters is what you
do on the court.”

And when Pitt does step on

the court, Bruce will look for

leadership from seniors Jenine
Joyce and Carol Morton, both

of whom are returning starters.

Joyce is the leading returning
scorer from last year, when she
averaged 11.2 points per game.
The 5—feet-9-inch senior can
play forward or guard. She pos-
sesses a deadly outside shot, but
is versatile enough to score
from inside or out.

Morton, the Lady Panthers’
5-3 point guard, led the confer-
ence in assists and was second
in steals. Her aggressive style of
play makes her one of the most
exciting players in the confer-
ence.

“Carol and J enine are leaders
both on and off the court,”
Bruce said.

Bruce has also assembled a
young, but talented supporting
cast.

He is expecting big things
from junior shooting guard
Stephanie Petho. Petho, who
averaged a stellar 35.9 points a
game in high school, will battle
for playing time with 5-9
sophomore Erin Miller.

Six-l junior Tressa Bolfert
and 6-2 freshman Latia Howard
should both see action at the
power forward position.
Bolfert appeared in 23 games
last year.

Bruce is especially impressed
with Howard. '

“She has as much ability as I

any freshman that we have had
here at Pitt,” he said.

The center, who has the tough
assignmentof replacing three-
year starter Miller, will most

The short college life of Missy

 Thompson has thrived off of an
r experience-ﬁlled first year.

The 6-foot-2-inch sophomore

I  center on the Lady Panthers bas-

   ketball team, Thompson has

 grown as an individual on and

off the court as a result of a trau-
matic freshman year.

“I’ve never experienced any-
thing like I experienced in my
freshman year,” Thompson said.
‘That year was a culture shock,

A and that is putting it mildly.”

A standout center for West

 Mifflin High School in West
 Mifflin, Pa., Thompson knew
‘ after her junior year that she was

 several basketball camps during

the summers of her high school
years, she realized that basket-
ball was something that she
wanted to be a big part of her
life.

The excitement and enthusi-
asm of a high school senior, who
accomplished the dream of

_  going to the next level to play for
 a major college like Pitt, was
 -  quickly deﬂated.

Humbled and intimidated,

C Thompson was no longer head

and shoulders above everyone
else.

“It was a shock once I got
here. Everything was so differ-
ent, the atmosphere and the envi-
ronment [of being away from
home],” Thompson said. “Not

rebounds a game. '
The team also welcomes the

only do you have to get used to
the atmosphere, but you have to
deal with a lot of competition.
You have to step your game up

"to be better than everyone else.

That’s har .”

Yet, it is this experience that
has given the sophomore a foun-
dation to build upon. She has
learned from last year, and it has
made her a stronger person over-
all.

Women’s basketball head
coach -Kirk Bruce is a witness to
this growth and improvement.

“We think Missy is coming
back this year with a lot more
confidence than she had last
year,” Bruce said. “I think num-
ber one, she’s feeling pretty good
about herself physically, and she
feels that she can stand up to the
rigors of playing her position and
that in fact she can handle it.”

Bruce attributes the boost in
conﬁdence to Thompson’s work
in the weight room over the
summer. The added strength that
she will come into the season
with is a conﬁdence builder, he
said. V

Having the support and conﬁ-
dence of teammates has also
helped Thompson coming into
this season, especially when they
look to her to fill the void left by
graduated seniors such as Jonna
Huemrich and Carolyn Miller.

“She’s going to have to take
over a lot of Jonna’s responsibili-
ties and score and rebound really
well,” senior guard/forward
Jenine Joyce said.

H-7

ffset loss of key playeg

return of sophomore point
guard Joanne Guzman and for-
ward Julie Fomadel, both were
injured last season.

In addition, Bruce expects to
get contributions from his
freshman class. Howard, point
guard Jaime Warren and center
Farrah Woods should all see
action.

In fact, Bruce will most likely
play everyone, as the Lady
Panthers will be more up—tempo
this year.

Pitt will do a lot of pressing
and rely on the fast break as the
mainstay of the offense.

“We think that we have some
quickness,” he said. “We can
hide some deficiencies, espe-
cially our lack of rebounding,
by utilizing the fast break.”

The new up—tempo style will
be based around aggressive
defense.

“We want our defense to dic-
tate the game,” Bruce said. “We
want our opponents to adjust to
us.” ,

And just as opponents will be
forced to adjust, Pitt will be
forced to adjust without its stars
from a year ago. A tough
schedule that includes
Arkansas, Penn State and
Duquesne will greet the young
team in a year that some have
labeled as “rebuilding.”

“People have said that it is
rebuilding because we lost four
seniors,” Bruce said. “But we
want to build on our success, on
what we did last year."

Thompson assumes frontcourtduties

  By David Saliba
' smﬁwnier

For a sophomore who aver-
aged 5.3 points and 3.3 rebounds
in 30 games last year, the pres-
sure to fill shoes that had been
worn by all-time Pitt great
Huemrich and three-year starting
center Miller, can be a lot to ask.

For Thompson, that is just the
way she likes it.

“Coming out of high school,
you are the big dog and once you
get to college you realize every-
one is asgood as you are. Now
I’ll get a chance to show every-
one how good I can be. I like
[the pressure].”

“Since last year she has
improved 100 percent,” Joyce
said. “She’s gotten a lot stronger
and she’s like a new player this
year. She has really stepped up
into the role we need her to
play.” -

That role is one that may
determine how successful Bruce
and the Lady Panthers are this
year.

“Missy is going to give us
quickness on our front line. She
can run and that is what we are
looking for her to do,” Bruce
said. “We are looking for her to
be able to get out and run on the
fast break, beat the other teams
post player up and down the
ﬂoor.”

Ask Thompson how she feels
about her coach's expectations
and she’ll say she loves to run
the fast break.

“When we get the ball and
run, that is where I’m best at.

3. Georgetown

With Othella Harrington as
Georgetown’s big man on
~ campus com-
bined with
coach John
Thompson’s
best recruit-
ing class in a
long time, the
Hoyas will
terrorize the Big East-

There are always doubt
about recruits, but Thompson
is lucky to have landed Allen
Iverson.

Iverson, who hails from
Hampton, Va., was one of the
most sought after point guards
in the nation. During his junior
season in high school, he aver-
aged 30 plus points a game.
But do to a bowling alley inci-
dent, Iverson served a short
sentence in jail while he was a
senior.

Look for this super freshman
to get the ball down to the low
post to Harrington.

Harrington, a 6-foot—l0-inch

junior, is the ‘best returning big
man in the conference. He
could step up into the All-
American class this year.
' Another Hoya to watch is
George Butler. Butler_, a 6-2
guard, had an inconsistent but
explosive first season. If the
junior college transfer can
improve on his 40 percent
shooting, his first step will be
more deadly.’

Look for this to be the year
the Hoyas advance past the
second round of the NCAA

 

tournament. The last time they.

did that was in 1989.

Last -season, Georgetown
finished with 19 wins and 12
losses.

Freshman Felipe Lopez hails
as the biggest sensation to hit
St. John’s since local boy
Chris Mullin first laced up for
the Redmen. The distinctions
between
‘82 and
‘94 are
that St.
John’s is
n o w
known as
the Red
Storm, and Lopez arrives with
loads of help as a member of
the nation’s second—best
recruiting class.

Lopez, 6—foot—11-inch center
Zendon Hamilton and Tarik
Turner all could be starters by
seasons end. Lopez and
Hamilton will be there from
day one, but the 6-5 Turner,
who led Oak Hill Academy to
the high school national cham-
pionship, must out duel an
unimpressive Maurice Brown
at the point.

A similarly unspectacular
yet effective performer, 6-5
Charles Minlend, checks in at
power forward. Minlend, who
produces consistent numbers
every night, could see his
playing time diminish if talent-
ed soph Roshown McLeod
decides to step up this year.

The wing spots are a logjam
of talent. There is the electrify-
ing Lopez, the streak-shooting

 

 

Derek Brown, spot-up shoot-
ers Fred Lyson and Sergio
Luyk and the underachieving
James Scott, who has yet to
showcase inducement for his
juco billing.

Nevertheless, look for Scott
to emerge from the pack with
Lopez.

If coach Brian Mahoney
finds a lineup with chemistry
and the talented kids produce,
St. John’s could factor into the
Big East race a year early.

conference play the previous
season, things can only
improve, and for the Miami
Hurricanes, a better season lies
ahead.

The key returning starter for
the Hurricanes is 7-foot-3-inch
senior center Constantin Popa.
With the pos-
sibility of
going in the
first round of
the NBA
draft, look for
Popa to have
a big season.

Other frontcourt players are
Steve Rich, who is slated to start
at power forward, Alex Fraser,
Lorenzo Pearson and 7-footer
William Davis. The Hurricanes
might have the most depth and
size in the frontcourt in the con-
ference.

After an injury-plagued
sophomore year, multi-talented
guard Steve Edwards becomes
the main man on offense.
Edwards has the potential to be
one of the best shooting guards
in the conference.

The largest question for the
Hurricanes remains the point
guard position.

Look for either JC transfer
Mitchell Dunn or Steve Frazier
to fill the gap.

The 94-95 season might be
the last for coach Leonard
Hamilton.

After five seasons as head
coach, the Hurricanes have yet
to have a winning record.

If Miami plays poorly, look
for Hamilton to lose his job.

The key to the Hurricanes’
season is to avoid the injuries

Aggelou, Jason Maile and
Garrick Thomas ﬁt perfectly into
new head coach Ralph Willard’s
three-point frenzy style of play.

The only returning starters
from last year’s squad are for-
wards Chris Gant and Orlando
Antigua. Antigua produces the
fire for Pitt while 6-foot-7-inch
Gant lays the lumber on the
boards.

Junior college transfer Chad
Varga brings a lot of athleticism
to a team that needs it badly. The
6-6 forward has a 41-inch verti-
cal jump.

Size is one of the Panthers’
major problems. Pitt’s tallest
player, 6-8, 200-pound Jaime

Peterson, is the only possibility
in the middle. From there,
Willard’s next option is 6-4
walk—on Charles Thompson.

With eight scholarship players,
three walk—ons and a manager.
it’s needless to say Pitt is hurting
on the bench.

Wins may be scarce this sea-
son, but keep in mind there will
be happier days next year.

Top Players:

Chris Gant, 6-7/Sr. — 8.6 PPE,
6.7 rpg.

Orlando Antigua, 6-7/Sr. — 10.7
ppg, 47 3-pointers.

Chad Varga, 6-6/So. — Junior
college transfer.

P.J.’s gone. Off to the world of
the NBA, the bearded leader of
the Seton Hall basketball pro-
gram for 12 years could not
resist the head position for the
Portland Trailblazers.

Finding a replacement for
Carlesimo was no easy task, but
after several months, George
Blaney, who had coached at
Holy Cross for
22 years, was
hired.

But finding a
coach is the
least of the Pirates’ problems.
They lost three seniors to gradu-
ation. Leaders Arturas
Kamishovas, Bryan Caver and
Darrell Mims all departed, leav-
ing Seton Hall with unproven
and untested talent.

The most talked about player

who will be returning is

junior Danny Hurley. After
quitting the team at the begin-
ning of last season,.Hurley
returns this season as a potential
starter at the point guard posi-
tion. In the backcourt with
Hurley is senior 6-foot-4-inch

Dwight Brown.

Also returning is 6-4 shooting
guard Andre Brown. Brown
who weighs 225 pounds is weak
defensively but provides a three-
point threat.

Freshman Levell Sanders has
the potential to develop into a a
quality Big East performer.
Sanders, who hails from New
York City, is able to play both
guard positions and has the abili-
ty to create shots for himself and
his teammates.

The other recruit is junior col-
lege transfer Jearwaun Tuck, a
true point guard who will spell
Hurley.

The frontcourt displays
Seton Hall’s best all-around
player in 6-5 junior Adrian
Griffin.

Though he lacks range on his
jump shot, the left hander plays
bigger than his size.

The other returning frontcourt
player is 6-7 senior forward John
Leahy.

A proven clutch performer,
Leahy hit a three—pointer
with seconds to go to help
the Pirates beat Syracuse in
the Big East quarterfinals last
year. That win secured Seton
Hall’s birth into the NCAA tour-
narnent.

Filling the middle position left-
by Mims is a raw 6-10 freshman,
Jacky Kaba.

Kaba who is a native of
Liberia is the tallest player on
this Pirate team, but lacks in
knowledge of the game.

This Seton Hall team is in a
transition year and will most
likely finish around the base-
ment of the Big East.

attempt by Merrick, Rutgers
headed to the locker room with a
14-13 halftime lead.

But it didn’t last for much
longer than the half.

After the Pitt defense three-
and-outed Rutgers to start the
second half, the offense took
Over following a punt at their 40.

Dietrich Jells’ reverse was
good for 17 yards to the Knights’
43. Then Ryan connected with
Curtis Anderson for 16 yards. A
six-yard gain for West, then a
10-yard completion to Jells
made it first-and-goal from the 5.
Ryan hit Davis on a quick slant
on second down for the score. To
compensate for their failed extra
point, Pitt lined up in their five
wide receiver set, and Ryan
found Chad Askew in the front
corner of the end zone to com-
plete the 2-point conversion and
Pitt led 21-14.

On the ﬁrst play following the
kick, Lucas’ sideline pass was
picked off by a diving Maurice
Williams at the Pitt 49. .

Ryan found Askew again, this
time 50 yards deep downﬁeld to
the Rutgers’ 1. West smashed
into the end zone on the next
play for the TD. Pitt led 28-14.

Rutgers countered late in the
third with an eight-play, 60-yard
drive, highlighted by a 25-yard
pass from Lucas to Battaglia and
a 12-yard Funderburk reverse.
Willis’ 3—yard TD run capped
the drive and made it 28-21.

Following its TD, the Rutgers
defense held, forcing Pitt to punt.
After calling for a fair catch,
Funderback muffed the punt,
and Pitt’s Curtis McGhee recov-
ered at the Rutgers 13.

Ryan found Davis in the end
zone for the fourth time on the
next play, the last play of th
third quarter. -

“He just found the openings,”
Ryan said of Davis, who caught
10 passes for 135 yards. “It’s
really easy to throw to a guy like
that.” ‘

Rutgers failed on three of four
critical fourth downs in the
fourth quarter, sealing the
Panther victory.

offensive linemen.

“Lawson Mollica is an excel-
lent center and Reuben Brown is
outstanding. They will be very
difficult to replace,” Majors said.

Brown, who was named a first
team All-American on Saturday,
said he was surprised.

“I never thought it would hap-
pen,” Brown said. “I’m really
happy-”

When asked about how his
future plans are shaping up now
that his collegiate football career
is over, Brown, deﬁnitely a ﬁrst-
round NFL pick, ﬂashed a big
smile.

“I’m coming back here to
coach,” Brown said. “I don’t
want to leave. We went through
the tough times and really fought
hard. This program is really tum-
ing around.”

Going up against a girl who is 6-
5 or 6-6, she isn't going to be
able to keep up. SO hopefully,
we’ll run [the other team] to
death.”

Although running the court
and her new-found confidence
are great assets, her Achilles’
heel isinexperience. '

“I think early on [inexperi-
ence] may play a factor, only
because she has never been
called upon to play a significant
role,” Bruce said. “Yet, I think
she understands that she is need-
ed to contribute a lot more this
year, and she is ready to do that.”

The inexperience factor will

not hinder Thompson, Joyce
said. She will be able to handle it
well, and she will be a leader on
the ﬂoor.

“The fact that she has gotten
better and she has gained conﬁ-
dence in herself will overcome
the inexperience,” Joyce said.

Thompson views her one-year
experience as an advantage to
most other athletes in her posi-
tion.

“I had the opportunity to play
a lot as a freshman, and a lot of
freshmen don’t get that chance.
It seems like I’ve been here
longer than I actually have.”

With this year only one game
old, Thompson looks into her

year, is charged with finding

the guy with the hot three-

point trigger. .

“The one thing we -want
Andre to do is keep develop-
ing his leadership qualities,”
Crean said. “He has to be the
calming, steadying inﬂuence
in the game.”

Sophomores Sotiris
Aggelou (6.1 points per
game last year) and Maile
(4.2) will combine with
Thomas (3.8) to spread
three-pointers across the
wing positions.

“Good guards win in col-
lege basketball,” Willard
said. “I think we have some
advantages in terms of quick-
ness out front.

“We’re gonna have some
bad matchups inside, but
we’re gonna have some good
matchups in terms of taking
those people away from the
basket.”

Pitt will not be packed with
a power frontcourt as in past
years, but that doesn’t mean
the Panthers aren’t capable
of posting strong numbers.

Wi1lard’s teams at Western

Kentucky were consistently
in the top five nationally in
offensive rebounding with no
starters taller than 6-feet 7
inches. Pitt has only one
player, Jaime Peterson (4.9),
taller than that height.
‘ Peterson is an active player
around the glass, but Willard
may team him with small
forward Orlando Antigua
(10.7) at the power forward
spot until either Gant comes
back next month or 6-6
leaper Varga (19.6 in junior
college) is healthy.

“We’re not gonna run the
flag up the pole no matter
what happens early on in the
season,” Willard said,

“because I think we can get
better as the year goes On.”

future with eagerness, not only
for herself, but mostly for the
Lady Panthers. .

“I hope that in my three years
that I have left here we can
become a really good program.
The individual awards is just
something that is given out. It’s
something that you are grateful
for, but in the end it is a team
thing.

“As a goal, I want to go to the
NCAA’s [championship tourna-
ment]. We went to the National
Women’s Invitational
Tournament last year, and not
getting a bid to the NCAA’s was
the worst feeling in the worl ,”
Thompson said.

H-11

Now that her freshman year is
behind her, Thompson is ready
to move forward, and Bruce can
not wait to see what that will
entail.

“Missy is a hard worker who
has a nose for the ball,” Bruce
said. “Once she gets out there in
the competition, she will realize
that she can do these things that
we always knew she could do.”

Thompson, a history major, is
focused this year, and she is out
to prove that she is for real to
herself and her opponents.

“They’re not going to take me
seriously until I prove some-
thing, so I’m going to have to do
just that.”
