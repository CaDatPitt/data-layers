By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

An agreement over a recent
housing hike was reached by
William H. Markus, acting vice-
chancellor for student affairs, and
Resident Student Association chair-
man Phil Cillo at yesterday’s
Student Affairs Advisory
Committee (SAAC) meeting.

The new agreement calls for a $24
housing hike only in the new dorm
buildings, Bruce Hall and the
Forbes Pavillion. The University

Chancellor

By GARY GOVERT
Pitt News Staff Writer

Chancellor Posvar told the Senate
Council Monday afternoon that the
attitudes of some state officials are
“reminiscent of 19th-century oppo-
sition to public secondary educa-
tion,” in referring to Pitt’s present
status in the state budget.

Public education has made this
country strong, Posvar said, and he
termed “insidious” the idea that
university students and their

had earlier tacked on the $24
increase to these buildings and the
cathedral suites in McCormick Hall.
The RSA complained last week,
claiming the housing office had not
consulted the RSA before initiating
the price increases.

Cillo said he believed the housing
office added the increase “as an
afterthought,” and that talks with
Auxiliary Services Director Tom
Albert and housing director Don
Hughes were unproductive.

Cillo also said housing officials

failed to consider renovating

existing campus facilities and
concentrated only on the new dorm
buildings.

“The Towers is the forgotten
child,” Cillo said. “We would like
to see a solid committment to
overall improvements in the quality
of housing.”.

Chancellor Posvar expressed
regret the housing office had not
consulted student groups like RSA.
before announcing the recent hikes.

“There was an oversight in not

parents ought to bear more of the
cost of that education. ‘

The Chancellor's remarks were
made during the Senate Council’s
monthly meeting in the Cathedral of
Leaming’s Babcock Room. ’

Reiterating many of the themes
he stated in his testimony before the
State House Appropriations Com-
mittee last Friday, Posvar said an
“investment in human capital” is
one of the most efﬁcient uses of
public funds available to the state.

He added that it is necessary to
reverse declining enrollment_trends
among lower middle-class men and
women who might come to the
University if tuition costs weren't
prohibitive.

Despite three straight years
without an increase in state funding
at Pitt, Posvar believes most
legislators want to give higher
priority to state-related univer-
sities. However, in a year when
many states are experiencing

talking to the students,” Posvar
said. ‘ ‘We’ve always tried to talk to
students before rates were publish-
ed. It is not our usual practice to let
student groups that have a say in
these things read about them in the
paperf’

Posvar also added that a tour of
the Pitt dorms would be set up to
review different areas of possible
renovation.

“I would like to get together with
students and tour the residence
halls,” Posvar said.

Vice-Chancellor for Business and
Finance Joseph A. Dutton cited
“uncertainties of the current year”
as reasons why improvements to
existing dorms probably could not
be initiated. He said renovations
could be started providing the
proper funds were available.

“We want to make some
improvements in the Towers,”
Dutton said. “The first priority will
go into our worst facilities.
Improvements will be done provid-
ed we have the funds.”

Pay-For-Story Charge

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News Staff Writer
The former editor of the evening
student newspaper has claimed he
was offered money to publish an
interview written to specifications
dictated by a presidential candidate
in the upcoming School of General
Studies Student Cabinet elections.

In an affidavit obtained by The
Pitt News, Jul Magrini, who
formally resigned his Night Times
editorship March 6, maintained
that candidate Debbie Alpert asked
him if she could pay him to
personally write an article based on
an interview with her.

Magrini told The Pitt News
Monday that the alleged offer was
made during a telephone conversa-
tion between him and Alpert earlier
this month and was allegedly “for
an unspecified amount.”

Magrini said he refused to accept
the alleged offer.

Alpert last night denied that she

budget surpluses, Pennsylvania has
come up short, he said. Also, most
of the state’s tax revenues are
already committed to mandatory
and inﬂation-countering increases
in other areas, Posvar added.
“We are caught in an election
year,” Posvar told the council, and
he said it was important to get early
commitments for signiﬁcant appro-
priations increases in 1979 from

gubernatorial and legislative can- .

didates of both parties.

ever offered to pay Magrini to write
and publish the article in question.

‘‘I never asked him if I could pay
him for anything,” Alpert said. ‘‘I
don’t know what someone would
gain from it.” A

Alpert indicated she did not
know who would attempt to throw a
bad light on her campaign effort.
“I don’t know what's in somebody
else’s mind. Ihave my ideas, but I
couldn’t substantiate them,” she
said.

Alpert also denied that she
specified what was to be written in
the article in question, indicating
that the interview was conducted
on a question-answer format.

Alpert said she would not
withdraw from the election race
scheduled for later this month.

‘‘I didn't do anything wrong,”
she said.

While saying in his affidavit that
he believed Alpert made the
alleged offer “without fully under-

Gives Senate Council Views on Budget Hearing

The Chancellor also discussed the
problems facing Pitt’s medical
school. He noted that tuition has
risen 200 percent in recent years,
and he questioned whether it would
be possible in the future to have a
cross-section of students from
different socio-economic back-
grounds if appropriations are not
increased. A

Pre-Meds Hold Conference  

By CATHY FARNAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
The ﬁrst Annual Premedical
Conference sponsored jointly by
Pitt’s chapter of Alpha Epsilon
Delta and the Pitt medical school

Wyyas held recently.

Representatives from Hahne-
mann medical school, Pitt med
school and a spokesman represent-
ing the field of. osteopathic
medicine explained their educa-
tional programs and philosophies
of a medical school education.

Pre-med students from ten area
colleges toured the med school and
participated in a question and
answer session and informal
discussions with the representa-
tives.

The high number of colleges
represented at the conference was
attributed to the “stringent compe-
tition for med school places;
nationwide 45,000 students com-
peted for 15,000 slots,” said Dr.
Albert 1. Lansing, associate Dean
for premedical affairs.

Last year, at the Pitt med school,
24 out of 135 openings were filled
by Pitt undergraduates, S0 of
whom were from Allegheny
County.

conference, Jerry Magone, presi-

Mid-East Tension Escalates

By The Associated Press

TEL AVIV—Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon Tuesday to wipe
out Palestinian guerrilla bases along its border. Guerrilla
spokesmen in Beirut said tanks and plans were attacking their
bases andgunboats were standing by to join the assault.

An Israeli radio reporter at the front said long columns of tanks
were crossing the 40-mile-long border into Lebanon, their way lit by
ﬂares dropped by jets. He said a heavy Israeli artillery barrage
preceded the attack. He said Arab gunners returned the fire,
bombarding some Israeli settlements.

A Palestinian spokesman said guerrilla defenders met the
armored assault with ﬁre from bazookas, heavy machine guns and
mortars.

‘ ‘We are trying to stop them every yard of the way, ’ ’ he said. “We
are using every weapon we have.” ’

The sounds of fighting drove Israeli border villagers into bomb
shelters for the night.

Armed civil guardsmen at Shelomi and Baram patrolled the dark

V streets. Troops battled a few miles away across the border fence.

An Israeli military communique officially called the border
crossing a “mopping-up operation” not merely retaliation for a
weekend terrorist attack in which Palestinian commandos killed 33
Israelis.

Sources in Beirut said Israeli tanks and troops supported by
warplanes attacked Palestinian guerrilla positions and Israeli
gunboats massed off the southern coast.

-Miners Defy Taft-Hartley

By The Associated Press

SOMERSET, Pa.—Despite a Presidential order and riot-helmet-
ed state police, the only moves made Tuesday by striking coal
miners in Pennsylvania were to picket non-union mines.

As a steady stream of headlights turned ‘into a supermarket
parking lot in the foggy pre-dawn hours, gathering miners talked
about where to picket—not when to stop.

“We ain’t got nothing to lose now. This is an undeclared war and
we want an unconditional surrender,” said one groggy miner, who
asked not to be identified.

A federal restraining order issued under the Taft-Hartley Act was
supposed to end picketing and force the nation’s union coal miners,
including 2,000 UMW members in Somerset County, back to work.

-But UMW pickets continue to fan out over this rural southwestern
Pennsylvania county early each day. State police said they are not
attempting to stop them. ,

The miners talked freely, but demanded that their names not be
used.

“Look, there's a federal injunction out now and the county
injunction coming,” said one of the apparent organizers. “We can’t
give you our names. We’re in enough trouble as it is.”

Caravans of pickups and cars pulled out of the lot at 6 a.m. One of
their first stops was the idled non-union Svonavec Coal Co. tipple in

nearby Rockwood. The pickets tried to stop company owners from “  '

entering the plant, and a single state police cruiser was there to deal
with them.

Explosion Touches off

Steubenville Evacuation

By The Associated Press

STEUBENVILLE, Ohio—An explosion and fire at a
manufacturing plant Tuesday unleashed chlorine fumes which sent
38 people to hospitals and prompted the mayor to evacuate all
downtown streets of Steubenville.

Mayor William Crabbe, who said he was afraid the fumes would
spread, ordered all available police, fire and rescue personnel to the
southwestern section of the city.

“We want everybody away from this area,” Crabbe said.

“We’ve got 30 ambulances on the way. We don’t want anything.
to happen. We’ve got plenty of police protection, so don’t worry
about your homes.”

Fourteen persons were admitted for observation, including Fire
Chief Bernard Bickerstaff, and 10 were treated and released at Ohio
Valley Hospital. Tentpersons were taken to the emergency room at
St. John Medical Center, and four others were at Weirton General
Hospital in Weirton, W. Va. ‘

Hospital spokesmen said all the victims were treated for inhaling
chlorine gas fumes.

Authorities said the explosion at the Famous Supply Co. heating
ﬁrm touched off a fire which spread to the National Colloid Co.,
which manufactures industrial water softeners.‘

Allen Franks. a spokesman for the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency, said at the time of the explosion there were 20 cylinders of
pure chlorine gas. each weighing 150 pounds. at National Colloid.
Also, he said, there were 30,000 pounds of the chemical HTH, a
substance containing 70 percent chlorine, used in swimming pool
water, andunknown amounts of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and
soda ash at the plant. ' ' '

said the children have a good
chance of recovery because of their
age.

“Younger people just seem to
bounce back quicker than older
folks. That gives the Ray children a
much better chance of full
recovery,” he said.

The Ray home, at 409 Fieldstone
Dr., is served by a Peoples Natural
Gas Company line, which Peoples’
officials say was found to be
damaged.

Peoples’ investigators have pre-
liminarily determined that their
pipeline at the Ray location was
previously damaged by excavating
equipment, Chuck Weber, the gas
company's news services super-
visor said last night.

the purpose of or persons
responsible for the suspected
excavation are notknown, Weber
added.

Peoples’ crews repaired the
distribution line Sunday afternoon,
and the Ray home was the only one
effected by the leak, Weber said.

Many offers of help have come
into the University since the blast.
Friends and colleagues of Ray have
started a fund-raising drive for the
family. Donations are now being
accepted in room G-58 of the
Cathedral of Learning. Checks
should be made payable to

Student volunteers also will be

on “Planning Directions for Ac-
ademic Programs, 1980-1990.”
The commitee’s report expressed
“concern over the diffused nature
of the prevailing CAS program. in
undergraduate education,” and it
recommended the re-examination
of the “structure and content of the

core part of the liberal arts
curriculum.” ’
In addition, the committee

endorsed the concept of a “double
degree” program whereby students
would be allowed to simultaneously
obtain degrees in CAS and one of
Pitt’s professional schools by
completing additional coursework
during an extended stay at the
University. The currently available
“double major” option——two
majors within CAS——was called into
question by the committee because,
the report said, it may restrict

, students from taking the variety of

courses essential to a liberal arts
education.

In response to the report, CAS
Dean Robert Marshall cited statis-
tics that demonstrate, he said, that
undergraduate students take a
sufficiently wide variety of non-
required courses. Marshall said
departmental curricula are too
structured, and he urged that no
additional 0' requirements be

imposed.

The council also discussed a
rough draft of a proposal that" would
clarify principles and procedures for
faculty appeals. The draft sparked
considerable questioning and de-
bate over the proper role of the
Senate Council Committee on
Tenure and Academic Freedom,
with speciﬁc reference .to its
handling of the Paul Nyden case a
year ago. Some members ques-
tioned the proposal’s “extra-
meritorious” criteria for faculty
contract renewal and promotion.

‘Also at Monday's meeting,
Faculty of Arts and Sciences-
Graduate Student Organization
(FAS-GSO) representative Aaron
Vessup introduced an FAS-GSO
resolution in support of striking
workers at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic, but failed to
receive full support of the council.

In a report, Edward Permar of the
council’s Plant Utilization and
Planning Committee spoke on the
University’s success in ‘achieving
mandatory cutbacks in the use of
electricity, and added _ that ad-
ditional energy conservation
measures are being studied.

Council is scheduled for Monday,

  " More Structure

Lately, it has become clear that many upper level faculty and
adn1inistrators—perhaps a majority of them—-favor putting more
“structure” into the undergraduate liberal arts program. Essen-
tially, this means the addition of certain unspecified requirements
that must be satisfied by all students pursuing a degree in the

College of Arts and Sciences.

Now, the Senate Educational

Policies-Committee has submitted a report thatwill probably rein-
force this trend back to a more directed liberal arts curriculum.

The Educational Policies Committee has expressed “concern
over the diffused nature of the prevailing CAS program in un-
dergraduate education.” It has recommended a re-examination of
the “structure and content of what is to be presented as the core

part of the liberal arts curriculum.

” The language is ambiguous,

but the implications of such statements are rather clear.

After Professor Flack presented the committee’s report at
Monday’s Senate Council meeting, CAS Dean Robert Marshall
countered with an impressive array of statistics that seem to show
additional requirements are not needed. Nearly everyone takes
necessary skill courses, he said," although many do not have a diver-

siﬁed enough educational experience.

If anything, he insisted,

departmental major requirement are too strict for students to be
“adventurous” in their course choices.

As of now, it’s not really clear who is right in this controversy.
Students should have as much latitude as possible in course selec-
tions, but it may very well be true that they could benefit from a
curriculum that better assists them in pursuing particular lines of
study. In any case, more will come of this in the near future. We
will be watching and evaluating what happens, and we think other

students should too.

County Democrats Jockey For Position

By R. DAVID TIVE

One of the things that makes
politics so fascinating is that it’s
always changing. There is always a
new cast of characters to deal with.
Every year there is a new election
to play with. New factors are
always being introduced that alter
the balance of forces.

This is particularly true with
politics in Allegheny County and in
Pennsylvania. They have been in a
state of ﬂux for so long that no one
remembers what stability is. The
events of the past few days are a
perfect example.

Last Saturday, the elected
committeemen and committeewo-
men of the Democratic Party met at
the William Penn Hotel to endorse
candidates for the May primary
elections. A lot of the excitement
of the event was removed when a
decision was made several weeks
ago not -to endorse anyone for
governor and lieutenant-governor.
In spite of that, however, plenty of
interest was still generated by the
race for County Party Chairman
between Gene Coon and Cyril
Wecht.

This wasn't merely a ﬁght
between two men who wanted the

stakes went much deeper than that.
Gene Coon had long been
associated with the Shapp wing of
the Democratic Party. He had
controlled all the state government
patronage that came into Alle-

gheny County, and in return for *

that power he had duly supported
the candidates favored by the
powers in Harrisburg. But, as we
all know, Governor Shapp will soon
be out of office since he is legally
prohibited from seeking a third

term.
Coon, realizing this, and also

realizing that Pete Flaherty and his
people were quickly becoming the
strongest faction within the party in
Allegheny County, began making
overtures to that camp to see if
there was room for him there.--room
that would allow him to keep his
dual position of county chairman

There is a third_

“machine.” This is the faction that
lined up behind County Commis-
sioner Tom F oerster last year when
he ran for mayor. This is the
faction that fought Shapp and csdn
for control of the party in this area
throughout the early 1970’s, and
was, at best, able to achieve a tie.

Last year was to be the comeback‘
year for the regular party. After
being kept out of the mayor’s ofﬁce
for eight years and reduced to
minority status on the county
commissioners, it would ﬁnally
achieve a major breakthrough and
elect a mayor. Things didn’t work
out that way. Dick Caligiuri

THOUGHTS. AND
REFLECTIONS

defeated Tom Foerster last Novem-
ber in the race for mayor, but the
regular party demonstrated that it
has not lost much strength during
the time it has been out of power.

How was it able to do that? It did
it very simply, by keeping control
of the basic party structure, the
committeemen and committeewo-
men. During the first half of the
1970's people like Wecht and
Foerster continually fought Coon
for that control. As was mentioned
before, they fought to a tie. In
1975, following the election of Jim
Flaherty as county commissioner,
the two sides joined forces against
what they perceived as the more
serious Flaherty menace.

The reasoning for that alliance
was simple. By early 1976, Jim
Flaherty and Bob Pierce had forced
Tom Foerster into a minority role
on the county commissioners,
Neither Coon nor Foerster had any
local base of power. They had no
city jobs and no county jobs to give
to their supporters. All Coon had
was state jobs. and with Shapp due
to leave office in two years. there
was no guarantee that gravy train
would continue.

‘The Coon-Foerster strategy was
simple. Win the city it) 1977‘, and

then no’ rnatter vwnate. happens«in.i*  

1978, we have a solid base for at
least four years. It didn’t work out
that way.

With Foerster’s loss to Caligiuri
last November, the scramble was
on. Coon, taking advantage of his
experience in law enforcement and
Pete Flaherty’s need to have
someone local to run things since
brother Jim was not proving to be
as capable a politician as had been
hoped, opened contact with the
Flaherty camp, using the new
county murder task force as his
pretext. This break of his alliance
with Foerster put the regular
Democrats in a ﬁx. They faced a
situation where, if Flaherty won for
governor, they would be complete-
ly out in the cold. They would have
nothing except the committeemen
and committeewomen, and could
not expect to hold on to them for
very long due to a new attack
launched from a new source,
Mayor Caligiuri. Caligiuri, in
trying to build his own permanent
base of support, is going after what
he perceives to be the weakest
faction, the regular party, and is
hitting them at their strongest
point, the committeemen.

The only option left to the
regular party leaders was to grab
something and hope for the best.
Thus, the decision to challenge
Coon for County Party Chairman.
Cyril Wecht was the obvious choice
to do it. He is a popular and
dynamic figure, and is not
politically ambitious. Wecht gives
the impression of being someone
who is in this for the sheer
enjoyment of the fight and has no
desire to become a power-wielding
magnate.

So what, after all this. is the
current situation? Coon has been
forced, by his loss of the
endorsement last Saturday to
Wecht. to cast his lot more firmly
with the Flaherty faction. If not, he
will end up with nothing. perhaps

 

Flaherty, for his part, is probably-_(-.,

putting pressure on Coon not to
continue his challenge of Wecht for
county chairman. A bitter party
battle in Allegheny County from

now through the primaries in May -

could spell disaster for Flaherty
who needs a big vote here if he
hopes to win the gubernatorial
nomination.

Foerster has to do everything he
can to get Wecht elected county
chairman, and then hope Flaherty
doesn't win the nomination.
Foerster could make a pact with
either Bob Casey or Ernie Kline,
should either of them win over
Flaherty in May. In fact, Foerster
may even join up with Casey before

the primaries, since Foerst"‘“'

supported Casey the two previous
times he ran for governor and many
of Foerster’s money-people from
last year are already backing
Casey.

In short, the current situation is
confusing. It hasn’t been this
confusing since the first arrival on
the scene of Pete Flaherty and
Milton Shapp, in back-to-back
elections in 1969 and 1970. The
chaos created by that double
whammy still hasn’t been resolved,

A Brief Glinipse of President Carter

By MAGGIE MCKAY

 

“We know what happened to
Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon
when they got isolated in the White
House. We’ve tried to come up with
antidotes for isolation”—Walt
Wurfel, White House deputy press
secretary, March 3, 1978.

The Carter White House has
many “antidotes for isolation,”
each much publicized by its
hardworking Ofﬁce for Media
Liason. The most famed ones are
Carter’s town meetings where the
president goes to small towns and
ﬁelds questions from the citizenry.
These town meetings are supposed
to let Carter put his foreﬁnger on
the nation’s pulse and let him
respond to the real issues
concerning the American public,
rather than answering questions
eternally posed by the jaded
Washington press.

“Washington reporters and
bureau chiefs become just as
isolated as us,” Wurfel said.

The Office of Media Liason, set
up to deal with non-Washington-

 based press, has set up a series of

public relations gambits to bring
Carter to the local folks and to bring
the local folks to the President in
Washington.

Earlier in his term, Carter’s press
people held on-the-record brieﬁngs
for local newspaper editors in
Washington. These brieﬁngs
featured four to six brieﬁngs by
White House staffers on issues such
as the Panama Canal treaties or
Civil Service reform. The highlight
of these all-day sessions is, of
course, a 30-minute press confer-
ence with the President. Recently,
college newspaper editors were

‘given a half-hour crack at the

President in the auditorium of the
Executive Ofﬁce Building.

The affair, which featured staff
members and deputies from HEW
and the State Department was a
fairly well-organized display of
political promotion. The 200 editors
and photographers received mas-
sive outlines of Carter’s domestic
and foreign policy accomplish-
ments in his ﬁrst year in ofﬁce (the
White House version, of course),
pamphlets on the Panama Canal
treaties, and a brief compilation of
Carter statements on everything
from his popularity and Georgians
in the White House to Israel and

_ arms sales.

75.

Each speaker, from Mary Berry,
the assistant secretary for education
in HEW to Dave Rubenstein,
deputy assistant to the President for
domestic affairs and policies,
answered the questions put to them
with little difﬁculty and with a calm,
assured air that indicated they were
saying nothing not said before
countless other such groups.

After 14 months in the Presi-
dency, there is already speculation
that Carter will be a one-term
President. Admittedly, 1978 should
be a decisive year for Carter, a year
that may well determine his political
future.

Congress has reacted with
hostility to many of the White
House proposals such as the energy
bill which is deadlocked in
conference. The prolonged coal
strike isn’t doing much either to
enhance the Carter regime as
unions threaten to defy the
Taft-Hartley back-to-work order.

These issues and others have
done much to sap public conﬁdence
in his leadership ability and his
ability to manage the nation’s
affairs. This public uneasiness has
begun to show in lower ratings of
public opinion polls. Now more
than ever, Carter needs to maintain
efforts to avoid isolation from the
nation and to keep in touch with the
citizen's views on crucial issues
such as the coal strike, unemploy-
ment and inﬂation.

And while the “antidotes for
isolation” set up by the President’s
public relations people seem
reasonable and even laudable on
the surface, their patent public
relations sheen is a bit too bright
and polished.

One gets a growing sense of
uneasiness and distress after
listening to Rubenstein expound on
Carter’s domestic policy accom-
plishments and failures. While
telling the college audience that
Carter’s aim to get federal judges
and prosecutors appointed strictly
on the basis of merit was not
waylaid in the Marston affair and
admitting Carter hasn’t yet devel-
oped an adequate anti-inﬂation
policy, Rubenstein dismissed many
of the administration’s problems as
a failure to sell policies to the
American public.

“We didn'tdo a very good job of
selling our programs to the public.
For example, the energy program
and the public education package
has not been sold to them as the

Panama Canal treaty has been sold.
We also made a mistake in not
telling the American people what
we have accomplished. Four
million jobs have been created. We
get little credit for doing anything
about the employment problem,”
Rubenstein said.

During his speech and subse-
quent interview, Rubenstein reiter-
ated his stand that public policy
failures resulted from poor Presi-
dential marketing practices.

Such an attitude does little to
diminish the Carter administra-
tion’s aura of symbolic showiness.
What the Carter White House
needsnow is a more substantial

critique of its effectiveness. The
White House needs to keep open

' communication with the public, but

it also would be wiseto establish a
hotline to a Congress disgruntled by
Presidential efforts to change public
policy single-handedly.

Carter needs some big victories
this year, but they can only be
attained by close cooperation with
Congress. Carter may have a better
chance of selling his legislative
packages to the people if he is
successful in working with Con-
gress. Carter has to prove that he is
capable of leading the American
people, but he can’t do it with a
shiny, controlled public relations
campaign.

Feeding pap to college students
and national newspaper editors may
result in some favorable White
House coverage, but it will do little
to pull his administration away from
the political pitfalls awaiting it.
Words do not make deeds.

Close Vote Expected on First Canal Treaty   

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON--Four previous-
ly-undecided senators declared
their positions on the Panama Canal
treaties Tuesday as backstage
maneuvering continued for the ﬁnal
few votes that will decide whether
the Senate ratiﬁes the pacts.

Declarations of position by
Georgia’s two senators and one
each from Pennsylvania and
Delaware gave each side two more
votes—and reduced to a handful
those said to be uncommitted.

Both Georgia Democrats, Sam
Nunn and Herman Talmadge, had
been expected to support the

treaties. Senator William Roth,
R-Del., produced a mild surprise by
lining up with the opposition.
Senator Richard Schweiker, R-Pa.,»
had been expected to oppose the
treaties.

Among those still undeclared,
only two or three evidently had
vote-counters for both sides com-
pletely mystiﬁed—Senators Jen-
nings Randolph, D-W. Va., Edward
Brooke, R-Mass., and Paul Hat-
ﬁeld, D-Mont.

An informal count by the
Associated Press showed the
opponents with 34 votes—the
number they would need to block

ratiﬁcation when the ﬁrst of the two
treaties comes to a vote on
Thursday. The same tally gave the
proponents 64, three short of the
total they would need if all members
were present.

Senator Paul Laxalt, R-Nev.,
chief strategist of the anti-treaty
forces, called that estimate “very
exciting,” but said his own count
was one or two votes short of the 34.

On the Senate floor, Senator Bob
Dole, R-Kan.,‘declared that if the
treaties lose, the administration has
only itself to blame.

“Those who stonewalled the

effort to improve the treaties with
amendments on the ﬂoor must bear
the burden,” he said.

The White House, obviously
recognizing that the treaties are in
serious jeopardy, has intensiﬁed its
own lobbying efforts in recent days
by warning of possible damage to
the prestige of the Presidency
should they go down to defeat.
However, administration officials
denied making deals with senators
to get their votes.

President Carter has used the
prestige-at-stake theme in personal

‘phone calls to what Laxalt said was

“damn near all” of the declared
treaty opponents in the past few
days.

Both the White House and
Talmadge denied published reports
that the administration had won
Talmadge’s vote by dropping its
opposition to his $2.3 billion
emergency farm bill.

Talmadge said he didn’t know if
the administration supported or
opposed his bill. He insisted that, in
any case, there had been no
negotiations with White House
officials. Carter’s press secretary,
Jody Powell, agreed, calling the
reports of a deal “absurd."

Jonas Salk Asks Approval for Vaccine

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG--Dr. Jonas Salk,
who developed the ﬁrst vaccine
against polio, urged a state Senate
committee on Tuesday to pass a bill
that would permit schools to
recognize his vaccine as legitimate
protection against the disease.

In a letter to the Health and
Welfare Committee, Salk said it's
unjustiﬁed for the state to require
that children be protected with the
Sabin vaccine before they can be
admitted to school.

He said his vaccine, which uses
polio virus that has been killed,
offers the same protection without
some of the risks of the Sabin

vaccine. That vaccine, which is
given orally, has live virus.

“It now appears that over the
past five years, all of the
domestically arising cases of
paralytic polio that have occurred
in the United States can reasonably
be attributed to the use of orally
administered live virus vaccine,"
said Salk, who could not appear in
person because of a previous
engagement.

“There is the further paradox
that the continued occurrence of
cases of polio in the United States
is attributable more to the use of

polio vaccine than the failure to use
it,” he added.

Under the bill, parents would
have the right to choose between
the two vaccines. The state Health
Department is considering adopt-
ing a new regulation that would
leave the choice with physicians
and permit schools to admit
children vaccinated with the Salk
formula.

The committee will hold the bill
until the Health Department acts
later this month, said committee
chairman Louis Coppersmith, D-
Cambria.

introduced in late 1954. It is
injected into the bloodstream and
children need four initial doses and
a booster every three years.

The Sabin vaccine, introduced in
1962, is usually given on sugar
cubes and is now used almost
universally. After the initial three
doses, no boosters are required,
the state Health Department said.

The Salk vaccine is still in use in
Sweden, Finland and Holland.

,Dr. Robert Gens, director of
adult health services for the state,
said the Sabin vaccine acts more
quickly than the Salk vaccine and

‘ transmits protection to people who

He admitted that there is a risk.
In rare cases, the disarmed virus
reverts to its dangerous state and
causes polio. But the incidence is
about one per 10 million vaccinat-
ed, he said. About six vaccine-ass-
ociated cases occur each year in the
United States.

Gens said the Salk vaccine is in
short supply and is really needed
only for persons whose bodies can’t
ﬁght infections or for persons over
18.

Salk said the vaccine is not easily
available because there is so little
demand. If restrictions on its use
were dropped, manufacturers
could meet the demand, he said.

° C For Ill-Starred Zodiac Signs

 

 

By PATTY TASCARELLA~
Pitt News Staff Writer

Everybody reads them, and
everybody denies their accuracy.

If you follow “Cosmopolitan,”
you’ll read about the sexier aspects
of your life in your horoscope.
“Glamour” focuses on work and
family, while syndicated columnists
in various newspapers deal with
health.

All the reports have one thing in
common—they’re favorable. They
may explain why you deserve a
promotion, how you are a pillar of
strength to your family or what you
should do to let others know about
your unsung attributes. But when it
comes to explaining your two-faced
boyfriend, that creep who picks his
nose on the elevator, or the psych
professor who refuses to grade
midterms on a curve, favorable

‘horoscopes don’t apply.

According to noted astrologers
like Sydney Omarr, Linda Goodman

and Sybil Leek, every sign has some
bad points; here is a guide to
unfavorable signs. "

Aries are power hungry and
aggressive. They usually overdo
these tendencies to compensate for
basic stupidity.

Aries have terrible tempers they
make no effort to control, because
other people interpret temper as a
sign of power. Adolf Hitler was an
Aries. Once an Aries has made up
his mind, there’s no changing it.

Taureans are just as stubborn as
Aries people, but have respect for
their fellow men and don’t look as
foolish.

Taureans spend incredible
amounts of time on trivial projects;
as a result, they rarely amount to
much.

Taureans are also very boring,
because of a natural tendency
toward dullness.

Gemini is the sign of the twins,

and therefore a dual sign. This
means that they are airheads who
can’t make up their minds.

Geminis tend to know a little

about everything and a lot about
nothing. They are always willing to-
tell you what’s on their minds.
When
improvise.

that is vacant, they

The crab is an apt nickname for
Cancereans. In a typical burst of
self-righteousness, however, Can-
cereans are billing themselves as
“moon children,” probably be-
cause they moon around a lot.

Folklore has it that Cancereans

tend to retreat into their shells,
which would be ﬁne if they’d only

stay there.
Cancereans are without preju-
dice, mostly because they can’t ﬁnd

anyone they deﬁnitely can brand as
inferior to themselves.

Chance to Gain Honors in N ew Pitt Program

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt News Staff Writer
Honors courses, ranging from

‘ classics to physics to philosophy,

are being offered at Pitt this year fo
the ﬁrst time. -

The University Honors Program
(UHP) gives Pitt students “the
opportunity to take courses which
are exciting and exhilarating,” said
UHP director Glenn Stewart. The
program, approved last spring, was
in planning for several years.

Approximately 150 students
presently are involved in UHP; next
year, Stewart hopes to attract over
200 students.

To take an honors course, a
student must have either a Q.P.A.
of 3.25 or special permission. If a
student experiences difﬁculty in an
honors course, he can drop back into
a regular class; in fact, he is
encouraged to do so.

“Our curricular philosophy is to
foster breadth as well as depth."
said Stewart. “We encourage
students to take honors courses
outside of their major.”

Stewart said he would like
students to take honors courses to
fulﬁll Pitt’s distribution of studies
requirement.

4

A mandatory classroom evalu-
ation of each honors course at the
end of a term maintains the quality
of the program’s teaching, accord-
ing to Stewart.

“The faculty is as willing to put
out an extra effort as are students
because it is a change to work with
an entire class of serious students. "
said Stewart.

The honors program has been
criticized as exclusive; some fear
that the removal of “exceptional"
students from regular classrooms
will harm other students. Only 20 to
25 honors courses will be offered
each term, however.

“The classes in UHP will
challenge the student to think while
also demanding him to work. The
courses are challenging, not
advanced,” Stewart said.

The program also encourages
independent study and research;
one student presently is spending
six weeks studying hump-backed
whales, in a project conducted in
connection with Harvard Univer-
sity.

Co-curricular activities also are
possible in the program. If an.
Under—Secretary of State were
visiting the city, for example, the

Costume ‘Country Wife’

By MELINDA COOPS

Everyone in the room looked

   

like Dracula had taken half of their
blood the night before. Overﬂow-
ing ashtrays and stained coffee
cups were scattered among scraps
of velvet, lace and gold trimming.
“Were you up all night?” someone
asked. A faint “yes” came from
somewhere in the room. The
costumes had to be ﬁnished that
night.

Heidi Pribram, costume designer
fpr “The Country Wife,” a recent

I‘-Pitt theater department produc-

tion, is in charge of the
catastrophes and accomplishments
of Pitt's costume shop. Karen
Mackes and Susan Wright, Pitt’s
two costume design majors, take

control when Pribram is not
around.
“The Country Wife," which

required ornate and intricate 17th
century costumes, was one deman-
ding project for the costume shop.

Cutting out and sewing together
costumes‘ is the obvious part of

éwstume designing. Before begin-
”~— . ing to design costumes for “The

Country Wife," Pribram had to
study the play. understanding each
character so his costume would
help to portray his personality.

Each bow and button had to be
right.

Not only the characters’ person-
alities, but the actors” personalit-
ies, are considered in costume
designing. Pribram and “Country
Wife" director Kathleen George
cooperated in this effort, altering
the renderings (detailed, painted
drawings of costumes) many times
before they ﬁt the personalities of
both character and actor.

Costume colors and designs also
must complement an actor's body.
Many measurements were requir-
ed for the complex costumes of this
Restoration comedy. and ﬁtting
was not limited to suits and
dresses. Each woman needed a
corset. bustle and petticoat; each
man needed tights. vests and
suspenders. Most of the perform-
ers wore wigs. and each wig was
cut and styled to ﬁt the face of the
wearer.

The l7th century dresses and
suits for “The Country Wife” were
tight-fitting, and made from
materials that are difﬁcult to sew.
If the armholes in a velvet dress
were too tight the designer had to

know before she sewed in the
sleeves.
So the costumer is another

person who gets satisfaction from a
challenging theater production like
“The Country Wife."

UHP might arrange a lunch for him
with honors students.

The transcripts of UHP students,
Stewart said, will state that they had
“honors” courses, and the UHP
ofﬁce will provide students with
letters of recommendation.

“If we are asked about two
prospective employees by an
employer, and one of the people has
taken UHP courses and the other
has not, we will recommend the one
who took the honors course,” said
Stewart.

The UHP ofﬁce is located on the
12th ﬂoor of the Cathedral of

Ohio Twins

aFShare Heart,

Hope Falters

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio—George-
ann Rodriquez, mother of Siamese
twins who share a heart and a liver,
says publicity about the boys has
brought plenty of letters, but not
from any doctors.

“No one wants to handle them
because of the heart,” the
Youngstown woman said in an
interview. Mrs. Rodriquez and her
husband, Elias, have talked pub-
licly about the twins, born Feb. 17,

I saying they hoped a surgeon would

come forward who could separate
the babies so that one or both could
live.

Dr. Wilfred Dodgson, chief of
pediatrics at Tod Babies’ and
Children's Hospital, said he is
preparing to send Christopher
George and Timothy Elias Rod-
riquez home by the end of this week
to await possible surgery.

Dodgson said the four-week-old
twins are gaining weight and doing
well, and that surgery will be
considered in four to six months.

The heart shared by the twins has
three chambers, instead of the
normal four. Doctors have said that
even if one of the twins survives the
separation he will have heart
problems.

Dodgson said in an interview last
month that if such surgery is
performed, the surgeon will have to
decide during the operation which
child to try to keep alive.

  Kids Beware
Lead-Coated 

Snowflakes

By The Associated Press .

PHILADELPHIA--Snow, the
fluffy wintertime delight of child-
ren who toss it, mold it and often
eat it. is loaded with dangerously
high levels of poisonous lead,
according to laboratory studies
here.

“The old saying ‘pure as the
driven snow’ just isn’t so,” said
Dr. David Grandstaff, a Temple
University geochemist who, along
with Temple environmental engin-
eer George Myer, ran analyses on
the. white stuff.

Myer and Grandstaff collected
snow in plastic bags from Temple’s
city campus after a Feb. 13
snowstorm, then hauled their booty
back to the lab where they used a
new technique called anode
stripping voltammetry to measure
lead levels.‘

Their conclusion: “Levels of
lead in the snow we collected are 10
to 20 times greater than the water
standard set by the Environmental
Protection Agency,” said Myer.

The EPA lead health safety limit
for water is 50 parts per billion.

“Some of the high readings we
got were up in the hundreds, up to
600 to 800 parts per billion,”
Grandstaff said Tuesday.

“Under the circumstances,”
said Myer, “we strongly suggest
that parents warn their children
never to eat snow, either as it is or
in the form of snow cones. It can be
dangerous to their health.”

The scientists also tested icicles
and said they found them to have .
even higher lead concentrations,
apparently picked up by water
rolling across spouts and roofs
where lead had settled from the air.
The tests showed that 90 percent
of the lead contamination in snow
and icicles was in the form of lead
chlorides and lead bromides,
directly traceable to automobile
exhaust fumes, said Myer.

Lead poison in paint, which can
cause brain damage in children
who unwittingly eat paint chips,
usually is in the form of lead oxide,
said Grandstaff, but all three lead
compounds are health hazards.

“We were a bit surprised by the
findings,” said Grandstaff, “but
once you think about it, it shouldn’t
be surprising. There’s no chance
for the lead to get out of the snow
or frozen waters.”

In lakes and reservoirs, Grand-
staff explained, microscopic lead
particulates usually settle out on
any available metal or mineral
surface. In snow or ice, however,
the lead remains locked in the
frozen water.

The study adds snow and icicles
to an already established list of
items containing high levels of lead
and accessible to youngsters,
including paint, certain types of
brightly colored printing inks and
the air.

“Eating snow is probably not in
itself enough to make somebody
ill,” said Grandstaff, “but with
children, all these things add up.”

Seven men, whose combined
ages total over 400 years, brought
to Pittsburgh’s Heinz Hall a portion
of American heritage, New Orleans
jazz. The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band performed 14 tunes ranging
from blues to ragtime Sunday
night.

The musicians from a bygone
age wore black, baggy slacks,
white shirts and dark ties. When
not playing they would slump

quietly in their seats and rest until
they got their cue to chime
together. They waved as they
started the ﬁrst set with “Hindu-
stand”.

The band hails from a building in
New Orleans from which they took
their name, The Preservation"Hall.
They have taken this style of music
that is native to America and
played it across the globe, from
Tokyo to Copenhagen.

Willie J. Humphrey, Jr. was
swinging his licorice stick and
shuffling his 78-year-old bones
across the stage to the joy of “Tiger
Rag.” Two minutes later, he sat in
his chair easing “Joe Avery’s

they bring the heavy brass sounds
of tuba and trombone to both subtle
and glaring realities. Jaffe‘s

style can blare out
"Bourbon Street Parade."

Percy G. Humphrey accentuates

tune with a tap or two of his right
foot. His trumpet prevailed

Ginger Rogers Dances Like She Did in 1934

By CINDI EVANGELISTA

Pitt News Staffwriter

“An Evening to Remember”
is an appropriate title for the
performance that brought Ginger
Rogers a dozen roses and a

standing ovation from a full house
i at Heinz Hall last night.

The
program opened with ﬁlm clips of
musical comedies in which Rogers

starred with Fred Astaire, making
them the favorite dance team of the
world. Suddenly, the screen
ascended into the lights and Rogers
appeared, elegant as ever, singing
the hit songs from her movies.
In between songs, she reminisc-
ed about the days when she was
still looking for a break in the
acting business. One day while in
the studio, she began to fool

around with the songs from
Gershwin’s musical, “Girl Crazy.”
Singing “I’m In the Money” in pig
latin, she was confronted by the
producer and given the starring
role on the spot.

After giving the audience a taste
of the song that brought her to
fame, Rogers then continued with
memories of Astaire.

Ginger Rogers, one time dance partner of Fred Astaire and in; 533.’ °i “ch

classics as “Flying Down to Rio,” brought her one woman show to Pitts-
burgh’s Heinz Hall this week.
Roger’s career, highlighted by a 1940 Oscar for ‘;Kitty Foyle” has spanned
Broadway, Hollywood, vaudeville and televisitert. Her act at Heinz Hail included
some musical numbers from her films, some selections from “Hello Dolly"
(she replaced Carol Charming on Broadway), and a dramatic scene from one of

her flims.

Not until ten years after “Girl
Crazy” did she team with Astaire
in Hollywood for their ﬁrst of nine
consecutive ﬁlms, “Flying Down to
Rio.”

Considering those movies were
produced over 30 years ago, one
would expect Rogers to be one of
those fading actors remembered
only on the late night shows. Not
so. She has been able to maintain
her beauty and grace as if time had
no effect. Her voice was sweet and
young as she sang a hit song,
“Embraceable You.”

Wearing a billowy pink robe,
Rogers asked, “How do you like
my evening coat?” then stripped it
off to reveal a pink and silver dress
slit from the waist down, revealing
one of her famous assets, her
shapely dancing legs.

Though she sang through most
of the show, Rogers also danced
with her new partner, Larry

Berto lueci

Merrett. A bright smile constantly
shining on her face, she waltzed
across the stage in the same
graceful way she did with Astaire.

Much to the aud_ience’s dismay, ‘V
Rogers did not repeat any of her 
tap dances from the movies,
especially the memorable jail house
dance in her role as “Kitty.”
Instead the crowd got more ﬁlm
clips while she changed clothes
backstage.

But “An Evening to Remember”
was not a disappointment. Rogers
displayed an abundance of vitality
even when addressing the aud-
ience. Her voice left everyone in
the audience breathless. Her
movements were limber and alive
with youth.

Who says that the great stars are
dead? Ginger Rogers proved
otherwise and is still charming‘ 
audiences.

By MIKEQSHIELDS

1900
Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci

“1900” is an epic whose parts
are greater than the whole.

Designed» as a celebration of the
victory of European communism,
“l900" emerges as a masterful
propaganda film, but is an
unsatisfying human story. Director
Bernardo Bertolucci has tried to
create a movie out of two diverse
art forms--romanticism and Marx-
ism-—and the end product is
stunning, beautiful and irritating.
ln the final scenes, “l900"
becomes shallow and intellectually
cheap.

“l900" concerns iii: destinies 9f
two boys born on the same day if
northern Italy. Alfredo (Robert
DeNiro) is heir to a great feudal

farm, while Olmo (Gerard Depar-
dieu) is the illegitimate son of the
local peasant patricarch.

It is Bertolucci’s chance notion
that “I900” can be held together ,-.
by the continued friendship of the"~).‘.""?5.-l""
boys, even though they develop".-ji‘i.‘i‘-V
different lifestyles: Olmo becomes
a peasant guerilla and Alfredo
develops into a weak Fascist tool.

The actors in “l900" cannot be
faulted. Burt Lancaster as the
landowner, and Sterling Hayden as
the peasant. are both strong and
intriguing characters. The delicate
tension between the two class
enemies is superbly depicted. but
unfortunately. Lancaster and Hay-
den have small roles.

clear-eyed peasant socialist.
Alfredo seems aware that his
family's way of life will soon end.

But Bertolucci abruptly switches
signals. Alfredo and Olmo are.
transformed into lovable but
clay-brained mugs who are tossed
about by the political battles which
explode in their pastoral kingdom.
Bertolucci chose to illustrate the
Marxist doctrine that individual
heroes are fiction, and progress
comes only from an aggregation of
social forces. The end result of this
treatment leaves the main charac-
ters with about as much vitality as
yesterday's lunch.

This almost kills the climax of
“l900"—-Alfredo’s trial by the
victorious peasant army. What

"Look at us--we’re everything
_\'our parents warned you about!"

That's the proclamation from one
of the songs on The Godz's new
album recorded live in Columbus.

For a debut album, its not bad.
but this plate is deﬁnitely for true
rock 'n' roll fans only. Throughout
the whole album is a continuous
noise of hard rock ’n’ roll--powerful
in projection and volume, but weak
in creativity.

Drummer Glen Catalina plays
the same way in every song, even
when given a solo in “Candy’s
Goin’ Bad,”. At first, he seems to
liven up and use his drums to full
potential, but then becomes a
disappointment, for he blows his

ﬁichance to recover.

There are a few cuts that can be
salvaged, and only because of lead
guitarist Mark Chatﬁeld. His
ability at the 6-string injects power
to the music and keeps the album
from getting too sloppy.

“Cross Country” and p“Under
the Table” are more like rock ’n’
roll instrumentals than .-anything

courtroom dissolves into a ridicu-

single handledly toppled Mussolini
and the entire German army, but
they cheerfully disarm at the
command of a middle class
policeman.

When Bertolucci clears the
screen of his utopian peasants, a
sense of reality returns. Alfredo

a fist fight, but neither wins because

both men have already lost their

guitarist Robert Hill uses the

, synthesizers to the hilt, conveying

an essence of the gods of thunder
and anger.

Considered the number one rock
n’ roll group in Ohio, the Godz
slightly resemble Aerosmith in
their vocals and their knack for
making hard rock ’n’ roll come
alive.

But to listen to this group for
music’s sake is an entirely different
story. The Godz are a fairly good
group but need practice before they
can even be considered big time.

Catalina seems to fall asleep at
the drums and awakens only for a
60~second solo which is better than
his other attempts but could be
improved. Eric Moore’s bass can
at times sound awesome and full of
raw power, but then tends to
overshadow the rest of the guys.

Given a chance, the Godz could
become a hit, if they can improve
on their next album. But this disc
will attract fans only as far as the
teeny-bopper crowd. It could have
attracted fans from plain ol’ music
lovers to heavy metal rock ’n’
rollers with slight improvements.

who displays vitality. His
glittering, ice-eyed Fascist _is no
representative of the early move-
ment despite Bertolucci’s implica-
tions. Sutherland does give an
excellent portrayal of unbridled ego
and rage--the disturbing portrait of
a man equally contemptuous of
proletariat and ruling class alike.

The less said about the Women of
“l900." the better. Bertolucci
seems unable to create a believable
heroine. Ada, played by Domini-
que Sanda. is the most irritating
and obnoxious neurotic to grace the
screen since Butterfly McQueen’s
portrayal of Prissy in “Gone with
the Wind."

Still, “l900" is a worthwhile just
for the photography and scenery,

and Bertolucci has the ability to

evoke sudden horror or charm.

Pitt 118-pounder Glenn Maxwell
is the youngest Panther wrestler to
qualify for the NCAA Champion-
ship Tournament since teammates
Rande Stottlemyer (134 pounds)
and Bill Bailey (190 pounds).

“But I’ve always looked at myself
as not being as good as those guys,”
Maxwell said. “Somehow, though,
I’m lucky enough to get to go.”

If Maxwell is not the best wrestler
representing Pitt at the NCAA’s
today through Saturdayat College
Park, Md., then he certainlyjs the
most improved out of a ﬁeld that
includes Stottlemyer, Bailey, 126-
pounder Jose Martinez and heavy-
weight Mark Stepanovich. A
career-opening less to an obscure
wrestler from Akron to a 12-9
season record (including a 5-1

“I made a dumb move (against

 Akron) with only four seconds left, ’ ’

Maxwell said, “and-it taught me a
lot about college wrestling. I was
ahead and just trying to hang on.
You can’t do that. I learned to be
aggressive the whole time.”
Aggressiveness earned Maxwell
a 10-4 decision in the quarterﬁnals
of the EWL Tournament at
Bloomsburg two weeks ago and a
chance to become an all-America.

I thought it would be close-——we both
had momentum towards the end of
the season. But I got the opening
takedown and kept the momen-
tum.”

Maxwell’s quarterﬁnal victory
was no surprise to him.

“I had a good league record,” he
said. ‘‘I was hoping that, when the
seeds out, that I would be on an
opposite bracket than (Penn
State’s) Mike DeAugustino (who
beat Maxwell in the ﬁnals, 7-4).
Except for DeAugustino, I thought I
could beat all of them there.”

And Maxwell won, meeting

DeAugustino in a ﬁnals match that ,

was-much closer than-a 11-O Nittany
Lion verdict earlier in the season.

“At Penn State, I was never in the '

match,” Maxwell said. “I wasn’t
mentally prepared.”

So, with a 12-9 individual record,
freshman Glenn Maxwell ﬁgures to
be one of the less-than-favorites at
Maryland today.

“Realistically, I’d say my
chances aren’t real great,”
Maxwell said. ‘ ‘But it’s the national

happen there. There’s always

Surprise--Nittany Lions Name Harter Basketball Coach

By The Associated Press

STATE COLLEGE--Dick Harter

, ..was a surprise choice yesterday as

er

s  head basketball coach at Penn

‘tate, which used second effort to
lure him from the University of
Oregon.

“Get me two cars and a cash
advance. I’m going out recruit-
ing,” the Pottstown, Pa., native
told Penn State ofﬁcials after
arriving here in a plane delayed by
fog.

Last week, Harter, 47, said after
a visit that he’d remain at Oregon,
where he began a new multi-year

Q» ,,ntract this past season.
 However, he said yesterday that

enn State had contacted him
again, and he decided Monday to
accept the job, vacated when John
Bach resigned--under University
pressure--amid his fourth straight
losing season.

“We talked further, and that led
to a sound decision on my part,”
said Harter, who’ll be joined here
by Jim Haney. his top assistant at
Oregon.

“The week’s wait was worth-
while, although we did lose some

recruiting time."

Haney, a native of Mt. Lebanon,
played for Harter at Penn and has
been his assistant the past six
seasons.

“I consider Penn State one of the
outstanding opportunities in col-
lege basketball,” Harter said
despite the school’s lack of a
modern basketball arena.

“Pennsylvania is a state of many
excellent high school players, and
our ﬁrst goal will be to attract those
players to Penn State, where they
belong.”

Harter was NCAA Division II
Coach of the Year at Penn in
1970-71 and Paciﬁc Athletic Con-
ference Coach of the Year
1976-77 at Oregon.

His 1970-71 team at Penn was
26-0, and his players have included
ﬁve ﬁrst-round National Basketball
League draft choices: . Corky
Calhoun, Bob Morse, Phil Hankin-
son. Ron Lee and Greg Ballard.

Oregon has the second-best
winning percentage in the PAC 8
over the last ﬁve years. It has sold
out every game in its 10,500-seat
arena in that span.

Harter was a standout high
school athlete in Pottstown, and
later played basketball at Penn. He
first coached at Germantown
Academy and Rider College before
‘moving to his alma mater.

Put a Tiger in the Field House for Increased Enthusiasm

Gimme a “P”; gimme an “I”; gimme a “T”;
gimme a “T”; who’s got one of the quietest student
sections in the country—PITT. Softer—Pitt. Sh-h-h.

If there is one thing good basketball teams rarely
do, it is lose games af ‘home. Every time UCLA loses
at Pauley Pavilion, rumors about California drop-

ping into the Pacific become a major topic of .

discussion. For Notre Dame to be beaten in South
Bend, God—ah, Knute Rockne—has to frown on the
Golden Dome. Cincinnati drops a basketball game
at. home about as often as Pete Rose goes a week
without aggravating opposing fans.

Needless to say, winning streaks on one’s home
court are born because of talent and coaching, but
are nursed into maturity by the university’s faith-
ful—or as Digger P_helps, the coach at Notre Dame,
likes to refer to the students—the sixth man. Phelps
has said that the students are as important to a _Notre
Dame victory as any coaching decision he makes
from the bench during the game.

Playing a team six-on-ﬁve is certainly an advan-
tage, and the intimidation and hysteria generated by
the fans often affect the referees (no man wants to
spend his final moments on earth under the angry
-mass of ‘Notre Dame’s sixth man), making the game
eight-on-ﬁve. Teams that lose more than oc-
casionally with suchfavorable odds should be sen-
tenced to playing for Lefty Driesell for one year.

Pitt has all the ingredients for a devastating sixth
man: a quaint fieldhouse that reserves nearly half its
capacity for students (2,500); a good pep band;
quality cheerleaders; a team that is constantly im-
proving and maturing along with its coach, and a
student section that is nearly always filled (games
against teams the caliber of Wheeling not included).

Something, however, is missing. All too often, the
sixth man is more lethargic than the security officers
that patrol the Field House. For some reason, the
Pitt students do not respond to the cheerleaders’ ef-
forts, making the atmosphere so quiet that players’
outbursts of disgust can often clearly be heard.

A catalyst is needed; he is spelled T—i-g-e-r. Paul
Auslander, also known as Tiger Paul, proved his

talent for awakening a slumbering giant at the Pan- ,

thers’ final three home games and Eastern Eight
tournament.

“I enjoy just watching a game,” Auslander said,
“but I can’t stand to seea game without enthusiasm.
When I go to watch Duquesne play, I enjoy Mossie

(Murphy) and what he does. He adds to the fans’ en-

joyment of the game.”
Auslander, who had been Pitt’s unofficial

cheerleader a few years ago in order “to get some
national recognition so I could get a better job” is a
changed individual. ,His ferver on the court is no
longer a vehicle to attract publicity, but is inspired by
the knowledge that “a crowd can turn a close game
around.” v

There has been friction (the John Cincola versus
Red Manning kind) between Auslander and the
cheerleaders. The problem centers around the fact
that the cheerleaders put an average of 12 hours per
week in on practicing, and resent the response and
publicity Auslander receives.

“Personally, I like what he does,” said cheerleader
Beth Alderman. “It’s just discouraging that the fans
cheer for him and not for us.”

“The group as a whole feels that the way the
students react to him (Auslander) and not to us is
discouraging,” said cheerleader Tom Bonavita.
“We work real hard, and when the fans respond to
him and not to us, it makes us feel all the work is for
nothing.”

As far as Auslander is concerned, there is no fric-
tion between Pitt’s official and unofficial
cheerleaders. His lone interest is to bring some en-
thusiasm into the Field House.

“I don’t want any publicity, let the cheerleaders
have it,” Auslander said. “They practice and work
as hard as they do; it doesn’t seem right that the
students won’t cheer for them. But you need

somebody to get the fans motivated, and it’s just too
bad that it isn’t a student.”
There are no students at the University who would

yelling “Let’s go, Pitt” loud enough for David
Washington to hear up in Alaska. Mossie Murphy
couIdn’t muster the same support for Duquesne later
that night. Translation: There is only one Tiger
Paul.

That night at the Arena is all the evidence one
would need to support Auslander’s permanent
position along the sideline at Pitt basketball games.

» When a team is losing a game, it could be easy for the

players to just go through the motions until the final
horn blows. A large number of fans expressing their
support is enough the get the adreneline ﬂowing in
someone like Tom Landry; imagine what effect it has
on a college basketball team.. Pitt, trailing by as
many as nine points, had a chance to win the game
with seconds remaining, only to have it stolen in a
manner that would have brought a smile to the face
of Jesse James.

If the game had gone into overtime, the fans might
have been a factor, and if they were, it was Auslander
who had whipped them into a frenzy.

“At the Arena, I was told that only official
cheerleaders were allowed on the court, and I accep-
ted it,” Auslander said. “Later on, one of the
Golden Panthers asked the policeman if I could go
on the court and do a cheer, and he said yes.”

The cheerleaders are not meant to be the villains in
this story; in fact, sympathy is with them for they
have the unenviable task of trying to coax noise from
an often apathetic mass. If there is blame to be at-
tributed, it is to the students. Rather than simply at-
tribute the blame and let the matter rest, or try and
do the impossible (change the attitutdes of a large
number of students overnight), the most logical path
to take would be to change the existing format so ‘that
the fans become participants rather than fixtures, at
the Field House.

This is quickly accomplished by the addition of
Auslander to the sidelines. The cheerleaders would
still occupy center stage, but when the time came for
some unadulterated noise, Tiger Paul is the man for
the job.

According to Karen Agostinella, coach of the
cheerleaders, the function of the cheerleaders is to
serve as a connection between the crowd and the
game in progress, to provide a constant flow of en-
thusiasm that the players can feel and provide some
form of entertainment during the game. Tiger cer-
tainly fills the criteria listed, but Agostinella refuses

to recognize or talk about someone who provides the
flow of enthusiasm she lists as a cheerleading
priority.

“As far as I’m concerned, there is no connection
between him -(Auslander and the cheerleaders,”
Agostinella said. “I don’t care to talk about him
with you or anyone else.”

This is a poor attitude indeed, for it would seem
that as a varsity sport, the cheerleaders are respon-
sible for the‘ enthusiasm generated at the Field
House, much in the same vein the basketball players
are responsible for the performance.on the court.

Auslander refuses to become embroiled in the
feelings of disgust that surround the situation.

“I want to get along with the cheerleaders, and as
far as I’m concerned, I will,” Auslander said. “I en-
joy the cheerleaders and their dance routines.
They’re really tremendous, and their absense would
detract from the game.”

A man who ranks the ovation received at the Penn
State game among the biggest thrills of his life,
Auslander believes the students should support Tim
Grgurich.

“Timmy thinks of other people over himself,”
Auslander said. “Good-hearted people are hard to
find. If the students support Tirn, they’ll be well
rewarded.”

Praise should go to athletic director Cas Myslinski
for not bending to the pressure that would have been
pleased to have a tiger’s head on a platter.

“I’ve always gotten along with Cas,” Auslander
added. “I consider him an excellent athletic director
and friend.

“I do what I_do from the heart,” Auslander said.
“I want to work with the cheerleaders. I don’t say
anything bad about anyone anymore, and I think it

has made me a better person.”

A little more cooperative effort and a lot less
hostility would make the Field House a place to be
feared by basketball teams across the country.‘ If
the basketball team makes the national rankings,
there will be enough publicity for everyone.

Three years ago, Pitt swimmer
Mark Schuman, a freshman at
Drexel University, qualiﬁed to swim
in the NCAA championships.

As it turned out, qualify was
about the only thing Schuman did.
Sv imming in the 200-yard medley,
the Philadelphia native admitted he
was busy watching what he
considered “the world-class swim-
mers" competing in the meet.

“There are so many darn good
swimmers there, you ﬁnd yourself
walking around, thinking about how
lucky you arejust to see them swim.
You really aren’t worried that
what's important is the way you
swim,” Schuman explained.

Schuman didn't compete in the
meet the following year. He was
forced to sit out a year after
transferring from Philadelphia-
based Drexel to Pitt midway
through his sophomore year.

Swimming for Pitt last year, he

managed to qualify in the 100-yard
butterﬂy.

Not so awed by the people around
him, Schuman did better than he
had done but he still believed he
could have done better.

“The guys who compete in the
NCAA’s are so strong,"Schuman
said. “In fact, they're probably
even stronger than most of the
people who compete in the
Olympics. Sometimes you ﬁnd
yourself impressed with them.”

All of which leads to Schuman’s
upcoming appearance in this year’s
championship, to be held March
24-26 at Long Beach, California.
Coming off his best collegiate meet
at last weekend’s Eastern Regional
Championship (Schuman copped
the outstanding swimmer award),
the junior promised he won’t be
overly-impressed with anyone this
time around.

“I know I belong with the best
swimmers. I know I won't be
watching the other swimmers as

much as I did in the past. That’s
behind me.‘ I want them to be
watching me.”

Schuman, who will swim on both
the 400-yard freestyle and medley

relay teamsfsaid the thing he wants“ ’

to do most is make all-American in
the I00-yard butterfly. For
Schuman to do this, he would have
to ﬁnish among the top twelve, a
goal Schuman thinks he can
achieve.

“The 100-yard ﬂy has always
been my best event, ” he explained.
“Right now, I think I can do it (make
all-American). In fact, I was
comparing last week’s times with
the ones from last year’s NCAA’s.
If I had the time I had last week, I
would have made all-America last
season.

“I had a 49.3 in the Easterns,”
Schuman continued. ‘ ‘Anytime you
can swim it under 50, you’re doing
all right. I think if I can get a 49 at
the NCAA’s, I'll be in pretty good
shape. I should make all-America. ’ ‘

Arenson’s Ring Career Is Not Quite Golden

By SAM SCIULLO
Pitt News Staffwriter ‘

After his career as a football
player at Chartiers Valley High
School had ended, Pitt freshman,
18-year-old Milt Arenson decided
to look for another sport, particu.
larly boxing.

Although he had been interested
in the sport for ﬁve years, it was
only recently that he decided to
enter the Golden Gloves Tourna-
ment.

“I knew some friends who
boxed, and the Golden Gloves was

'.a goal set a year ago,” he said.

Alifelong resident of Scott
Township, Arenson joined the La
Quatra Boys’ Club, formerly of the
Southside but now in Swissvale,
and under the guidance of his
trainer, Billy Gilliam, learned the
skills necessary for boxing.
Arenson said that Gilliam works
with ﬁve ﬁghters and serves as
their teacher.

“He showed me everything I
know,” Arenson said.

After an extensive training
period that included busing to the

gym in Swissvale every afternoon

and working out, Arenson ﬁgured
to be ready for the tournament.
What he hadn't counted on was the
case of bronchitis he came down
with days before the ﬁght.

On Feb. 14 at Allegheny
Community College, Arenson en-
tered the ring for his opening-
round, single-elimination bout.
William LePosa of the Slippery
Rock Boys‘ Club was his opponent
in the 156-pound division.

Frazier to Fight Knoetze

PHILADELPHIA (AP)——Former
heavyweight champion Joe Frazier
will come out of retirement to sign a
contract to ﬁght Kallie Knoetze of
South Africa, promoter Mickey Duff
of London said yesterday.

Duff said the ﬁght will be held
April 29 in Las Vegas. The site has
not been determined, he said.

Frazier, who last boxed 22
months ago in a losing effort against

At the start of the three-round
ﬁght, Arenson danced and scored
with a couple jabs. LePosa was
swinging wildly and not connecting
until, .Arenson explained, “he
caught me with a wild punch in the
solar plexis and it knocked me
down.” Arenson stood up when the
count had reached nine, but
noticed the increasing difﬁculty he
was having breathing. LePosa won
the round.

Arenson fought the second round
trying to limit his movement and

George Foreman, will get $420,000
and Knoetze, $150,000, Duff said.
Frazier was originally scheduled
to make his comeback against Gerri
Coetzee, also of South Africa, but
their proposed April 15 bout was
cancelled for undisclosed reasons.
Knoetze knocked out Duane
Bobick in Johannesburg on " Feb. 4

with a combination, then a short
right to the jaw.

attempting to keep the ﬁght in the
middle of the ring. Again, Arenson
scored with jabs, but soon found
himself up against the ropes,
covering up from the blows from
his shorter opponent. Despite the
late rally by LePosa, Arenson won
the round.

Trainer Billy Gilliam asked
Arenson if he wanted to quit
because of the breathing problem,
but the ﬁghter answered the bell
for the ﬁnal round. Employing the
same jab-and-score techniques that
won the previous round, Arenson
started to go to work on LePosa’s
face, only to get tied up several
times. It was at this point of the
ﬁght that Arenson realized he was
in trouble.

“A couple more jabs and I
probably would have put him away,
but by the end of the ﬁght I could
hardly breath,” he said.

The round and the ﬁght went to
LePosa.

Reflecting on the outcome,
Arenson was only slightly bitter.

“I thought I fought back enough
that I won, but I only won on one
judge’s card, losing a split
decision.”

In the locker room after the ﬁght,
Arenson had to lie down for 20
minutes.‘ A doctor suggested that
he go to a hospital for chest X-rays.
Only then was the “ bronchitis
revealed.

Arenson was told to spend the
next three days in bed, but got up
after only a day. He was quite
upset because, after eight months
training, he thought he was in
perfect condition to ﬁght.

The blonde ﬁghter now says that
boxing was always a goal and that
ﬁghting in the Gloves achieved that
goal despite the loss. He doesn't
know if he’ll ﬁght again, but does
promise to continue working out as
soon as he’s healthy.

Don’t be surprised to see Milt
Arenson’s name on the Golden
Gloves slate next year. Anybody
who would see the movie “Rocky”
eight times has to be crazy about
the sport.

By The Associated Press

MONTREAL—National Hockey
League president John‘ Ziegler
advised the Detroit Red Wings that,
based on the information available
to him, he would not interfere with
Derek Sanderson’s comeback with
the Pittsburgh Penguins last night.

Sanderson, who has been out of
action since his release from the
Vancouver Canucks -in December,
agreed to terms with the Penguins
Monday night and was in Los
Angeles to join the team for its
game against the Kings last night.

Red Wings General Manager Ted
Lindsay claimed the Penguins
tampered with Sanderson, a free
agent who had been working out
with Detroit and its Kansas City
affiliate in the Central Hockey
League before he accepted
Pittsburgh’s offer.

Tampering is an attempt to lure a
player away from his employer, and
ziégléf i§ emﬁaweiea to impose
strict penalties if tampering is
proven. The penalties include ﬁnes
and possible loss of draft choices to
the club.

mers and as a team.”

In the Eastern regional cham-
pionships at Penn State two weeks
ago Pitt had a strong fourth-
place showing. Leading the
Pantherettes was all-America
Kathy Stetler. The junior from
Oakmont set meet and team records
in ﬁve individual events (50- and
100-yard butterﬂy and 50-, .100-,
and 200-yard freestyle) and anchor-
ed the 200-yard freestyle relay team
to another meet and team record to
become the ﬁrst swimmer in meet
history to shatter six records.

Washington, advised Lindsay that
‘ ‘based on the information we have,
we do not believe we are in the

Stetler will compete in the same
events this weekend and also will
anchor the 400-yard freestyle relay
team of Davis, Elston and Pulley.

“Kathy will have a great meet if
she can swim th‘e”w"ay she's been
swimming lately,” Matheson said.
“As for records, she can break a few
of those, too. It depends on how she
swims as to what she does. She has
a good shot at winning four of her
events (50- and 100-yard ﬂy and 50-
and 100-yard freestyle). She’s just
been doing some super swimming
lately.”

Stetler earned all-America
honors in both the 50-yard ﬂy and
100-yard freestyle with a pair of
11th place ﬁnishes at last year’s
nationals.

.from signing with any NHL club.”
. Ziegler did, however, reserve the

I New Penguin Derek Sanderson

Noting that the top 16 ﬁnishers in
each event earn all-America
distinction, Matheson also antici-
pates solid showings from freshman
Pulley (100-yard individual medley
and 100-yard breastroke), sopho-
more Guyer (100-yard breastroke),
and both the 200- and 400-yard
freestyle teams (Davis, Stetler,
Elston and Pulley will swim in
both.).

“Last year, we ﬁnished 32nd in a
ﬁeld of about 95,” Matheson said.
“This year, we should improve our
team standing a lot. If we can
qualify both relay teams (in the
ﬁnals), we'll move up even more.”

According to Matheson, Arizona
State should win the team

right to review the tampering
allegation in the event further
information becomes available.

“Although we had not signed
Derek to a contract, we had incurred
considerable expense with him,”
Lindsay said in Detroit earlier
yesterday.

“The actions of the Pittsburgh
club, Sanderson’s agent Bob Woolf
and Derek himself soniehow
destroys your faith in people.

“There is no way he (Derek) is
ready to play,’’ Lindsay continued.
“We had a rehabilitation program
set up for him with hopes that he
could help out Kansas City team the
remainder of the season, continue
on a program during the summer,
come to camp and not only make out
club but be able to help us.”

“It was Dei:ek’s decision. He felt
he was ready to come back and he
wanted to play in the National
Hockey League. Is that so wrong?”
Woolf retorted from his Boston
office. _ - _

The Detroit Red Wings weren’t
seeing it that way. They appealed
yesterday to the NHL that

championship, with Southern
California, Miami (Fla.) and
Alabama ﬁnishing close behind.
Although she believes Rutgers,
Princeton and Penn State (the
teams that ﬁnished ahead of Pitt at
this year’s Eastems) should place
strongly, Matheson doesn’t think
any of these three teams will be
among the top dozen or so ﬁnishers.
“Arizona State’s going to take it.
As far as we’re concerned, we’re,
going to improve our team
standing. We could improve even
more if we had one, good quality
backstroker,” said Matheson,
pointing out that the Pantherettes
(5-4) were probably that back-
stroker away from an undefeated
dual meet season.

efuses to Intervene in Sanderson Comeback

Pittsburgh’s signing of Sanderson
was tampering.

Tampering is the attempt to lure a
player away from his employer.
NHL president John Ziegler, a
former Detroit vice president, can

impose penalties on teams guilty of H ’ V

the charge.

Coach Named

(Continued from Page i9)

His Oregon team was 16-11 with
four freshman in the starting
lineup.

“We had felt that the situation
was settled once Dick Harter said
last week he had withdrawn his
name from candidacy for the head
coaching position at Penn State,"
said Caine_. .

“Our responsibility now is to
ﬁnd a successor to maintain our
basketball program at a high level
of success. I’m conﬁdent that can
be done.”

Hardin after his Owls fumbled awav a 76-0 decision
to the Panthers in Philadelphia: “We got the hell
kicked out of us.”

Pitt’s Tim Grgurich on his basketball team’s
December road loss to Evansville: “We have to learn
how to win on the road, but first we have to learn
how to win period.” a ,

Student Government Board member Dave
Hesidence on the funding plight of Pitt’s hockey
program: “The Pitt hockey club shouldn’t be
punished for being as good as it is.”

Panther football coach Jackie Sherrill after his
team failed to tie Penn State despite scoring a touch-
down with 12 seconds left in their final regular-
season game: “I guess we kept everybody in their
seats.”

Rebuttal—Sherrill in Jacksonville after reading an
overzealous newspaper account that had the Pitt-
Clemson Gator Bowl matchup billed as the “city
slickers versus the country boys”: “I spread more
fertilizer than (Clemson coach) Charley (Pell) ever

’did.”

A New York reporter interviewed Sherrill after the
Pitt-Army game and to one of Sherrill’s token post-
game quotes about Matt Cavanaugh (“If there’s a

Cinicola when asked how another Eastern Eight

Panther water polo coach Miguel Rivera on his

team’s chances in the Mid-Atlantic Conference
Championships if compent officials would be in
charge: “It will be like taking candy from a baby.”

Dick Bradshaw, coach of Pitt’s unbeaten swim
team, after easily beating Cleveland State and
Clarion State in consecutive meets: “It’s hard to get
enough motivation for good times with these kinds of
meets. We need some challenge at the end of the
season.”

Ditto Bob Greenweld,
freestylers: “These meets are a waste of time.
would be better off practicing.”

Foresight—Clemson fans talking to their Pitt coun-
terparts the night before the Tigers lost, 34-3, in the
Gator Bowl: “We love ya for beating Georgia last
year (in the Sugar Bowl), but we’re still gonna whup
your butts tomorrow.”

Rutgers basketball coach Tom Young (whose team
lost in the first round of this year’s Eastern Eight
tourney) after being congratulated by other league
coaches at a pre-tournament press gathering for
posting a good regular season record: “Last year I.
heard the same thing, and we got to listen to the
semifinal and final rounds on the radio.”

team, which had won only five. games in its previous
two seasons, would be offered a post-season bowl
bid: “I didn’t even think we’d survive the year.”
Hindsight—John Bach, the Penn State basketball
coach who was forced into retirement at the end of
this season, at an Eastern Eight press luncheon:
“The insignia for the Eastern Eight should be an

eight ball with all the coaches in the league behind it.

I guess I’m living proof of that.”

Miguel Rivera after his water poloists finished,’

second at the Eastern Championships as result of a
21-20 sudden-death loss to Bucknell: “If someone
would’ve come up to me when we were ahead by two
goals with 1:18 left and said we would lose, I

would’ve bet my neck against it; that’s how confident‘

I was. But if I had done that, I wouldn’t be here
talking about it today.”

Outasight—Len Barcalow explaining how he
would alleviate a mid-season lack of motivation on
his hockey team: “Some guys think that just because
they put on a jock before a game they’re going to
play. They’re wrong. l’ve worked a new strategy
called ‘jerk hockey.’ The first guy I see loafing out
there will be jerked off the ice so fast his stick will be
left behind.” . -

Jackie Sherrill to Gordon Jones after Jones made a
superhero catch to help Pitt beat Navy: “When are
you going to start catching the easy ones?”

Massachusetts basketball coach Jack Leamon on
Duquesne’s Rich Cotten, who returned from an
ankle injury to pace the Dukes to an Eastern Eight
overtime victory against the Minutemen: “I just
have one question—where the hell is Lo‘ ‘es? Cot-
ten didn’t look like he'was running arou. .i on a bad
ankle; you can’t trust those Catholic schools.”

Pitt football fans in Jacksonville who heard that
the nationally televised Gator Bowl would be blacked
out in Jacksonville: “This is the only city that would.

black out a sold-out game. It would probably black ,

out a Christmas Day mass.”

Those same fans comparing theprevious season’s
Sugar Bowl experience to the Florida night life: “It

Of course there is life after college.

There are job interviews when you
can get them, resumes to be written and
sent out, employment agencies,
classified ads, personnel directors who
read your transcripts and say: “You
must have seen a lot of movies in the
last four years," parents who look at
your degree in communications, sigh,
and ask, “How do you think you're
going to pay for your stereo with that?”

And there is more.

boots and torquoise jewelry, then ex-

The

was filled—a month ago.

making of new friends, the finally
dragging yourself to a singles bar
because that’s where all your co-
workers spend Saturday evening, the
wearing of new three-piece suits, the
sinking feeling when your new boss
giggles for 10 minutes after hearing
your suggestion for a starting salary.
Of course there is life after college.
No one says you have to get a job.

Graduate school is, as they say, a viable
option. The applications are expensive,

perhaps, and take weeks to complete,

tuition is high, yes, but what’s a few-

more thousands of dollars to borrow
when you already owe as much? It
means a new school, interdepartmental
politics. pages of work, and professors
who will look at you and say: “You
know, now you are supposed to take
school seriously."

Of course there is life after college.

The realization will sink in now, only
weeks before graduation. Seniors will
walk across Forbes Avenue, look up at
Hlllman Library and remember how it
became a second home during mid-
terms. Or they will stand in the Com-
mons Room, remember how the Tuck
Shop became a Burger Chef and the
way their circle of friends changed from
year to year.

Of course there is life after college.

Now seniors will think about how
they can walk through the Student
Union any afternoon and find a friend to
have lunch with. They will recall how
familiar the Quad, PAT buses and the

Four Yearsof a Frizz

Wednesday, March 15, 1978-5TH AVENUE—Page 3

y IDentity

By Lisa Rubenstein

It rained the day I got my college ID
picture taken.

Four years ago, it rained and my hair
is all frizzed in my picture. Since then,

every time I have had to show my ID to .

get a book out of the reserve bookroom,
or showmy ID to get a ticket to an
athletic event, I have to look at that pic-
ture.

It never fails. I hand them my ID; they
look at my picture and suppress a
giggle. I mumble that it's not my fault.
‘.‘It rained that day,” I say.

Four years ago, and it still plagues
me.

I’ve used it to cash checks, get my
passport and discounts at movies and
museums all over the place. When
there's nothing to talk about at a party or
in a bar, I pull out my ID and give
everyone a good laugh.

Indeed, an ID is a useful thing to have
if you are a student. Every student from
every college in America has one. It's
something we all have in common.

It's the security to clutch to during
the summer, when you get that high-
paying job in a factory—the really boring
one. If you get frustrated, you can whip
your college ID out of your pocket and
reassure yourself that you won’t be in
the factory for the rest of your life.

My ID is in many ways, my identity as
a student, All I’ve had to do for the past
four years is to look at it to know who I
am. .
But now, with the impending freedom
of graduation, that ID will no longer tell
me who I am, what I’m like, or even what
part of the state budget should concern
me the most.

In the 1960's, students might have
burned them; in the early 70's, they
might have forgotten them. And
us—what will they say we did with ours?

The New York Times and Walter
Cronkite probably will say we tried to

Lisa Rubenstein, managing editor of
5th A ve, will graduate in April.

get jobs with ours—or that it didn’t mat-
ter what we did with them, as long as it
was to help ourselves.

I would say that we are as concerned
as students of the 60's, and as quiet as
those of the early 70’s. We're as con-
cerned about helping others and im-
proving society, but I think we're more
realistic about what we can accom-
plish—and perhaps a little embarassed
that we can't do more.

And in our realism and our fear for
our futures, it is a little harder to spend
the energy to save the world.

We went into college expecting to
find what we were looking for-—how to
be happy, and even how to find a
lucrative career.

Instead, many of us were forced to
find other things that turned out to be

just as good, if not better, than what we
had expected.

It's a lot like a college ID. You go in
expecting to keep the same one for four
years. When you lose it, chances are
the picture is just as bad, if not worse,
than the picture on the ID that you lost.

But in the end it doesn’t really matter
what it looks like. They may laugh-but
they still let me take books out of the
library.

Four years is a long time to spend
finding something you didn’t know you
were looking for. p ‘

I had freshman fear and frenzy,
sophomore slump, junior jubilation and
now I have senioritis. I had one demon-
stration, and took a radical position on
some issues. I talked about liberal arts
and teaching and tenure—as well as the

fate of the football team. I went to par-
ties and hung out in bars, and I even
climbed to the top of the Cathedral-to
the roof, no less.

In a lot of ways, it wasn't as long as it
seemed. A

It's sort of funny, looking at my ID
and thinking about’ the starry-eyed
freshman that came to school here four
years ago.

It was summer, and I was tanned,
and I was in college. I came here as the
next logical step in my education, with
no worries about what to major in or
what to do when I got out of school.

I remember only one part of my orien-
tation very clearly. One day, I decided
to take a trip downtown. I was standing
at the bus stop in front of the Towers
with a free bus ride coupon clutched in
my hand, ready to take any 73, 75 or
76 that drove by.

A woman was standing next to me,
holding books, in her hand—organic
chemistry and calculus, I think.

I guess she could tell from the way I
was straining my eyes for the bus that I
was new at school. ‘

“Are you a freshman?” she asked.

“Yes,” I replied.

“l’Il be graduating from here at the
end of August,” she said.

“Really?” I wasn't very interested,
but it seemed like the right thing to say.

“You know, that four years goes,

really quickly. It doesn’t seem like it will,
but before you «know it—-it's over.

Thebus came andl got on.

Back then, in June 1974, I didn’t
really give her more than a moment's
thought. I’d never been in downtown
Pittsburgh before, and I had never
before been in college. I was about to
embark on an ‘adventure.

After all, who pays attention to the
maudlin ramblings of graduating
seniors? Certainly not freshmen.

So instead of listening, I got on the
bus.

And now, I suppose, I'm getting off it.

  Job Market : the Shelves are Empty >

By Deanna Louise

Cathy Green graduated from Pitt last April with
a bachelor’s degree in political science. As an un-
dergraduate, she harbored aspirations to attend
either law or graduate school becuase a B.A. in
political science is “just not marketable. ”

Last spring, she was accepted by the Graduate
School of International and Public Affairs, but
deferred her admission and entered a two—year
buyer’s training program at Kaufmann’s depar-
tment store downtown.

Cathy’s degree in no way prepared her for her
present job, but she expressed no regrets about her
college experience and is very enthused about
being a buyer.

“It ’s fast-moving and exciting. I like the people
I work with. They ’re young and energetic.

“I’m happy with this, because my trade will be
extremely marketable anywhere in the country af-
ter Iprove at Kaufmann ’s I can do thejob.

“Buying was something in the back of my mind
I always wanted to try. I think I have a natural
feel for it.

“Now, I’m an assistant buyer in misses spor-
tswear. When I ’m a full buyer, I ‘ll get to travel to
different cities to order stock for my department.

“I work 50-60 hours a week, like most buyers,
because it ’s really fastpaced, but I ’m so absorbed
in the work I don ’t think about the time.

Breaking into one’s chosen
profession upon college graduation is
the goal of nearly all students. But this
venture can be rough sailing for even
the well-qualified job hunter if the market
for his talents is poor. According to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, one out of
four college graduates will not get the
job for which they prepared. instead,
they will load trucks, drive buses,
manage offices, sell insurance and bake
pastries, even though, like Cathy, they
may be quite happy in their pursuits.

A century of higher education in
America has produced an oversupply of
qualified practitioners in the coveted
white-collar jobs that offer appealing
financial gains in addition to an oppor-

writing major, is a Pitt News staff

tunity for personal growth. The National
Center of Education Statistics projects
13.1 million college graduates will enter
the civilian labor force by 1985—about
50 percent more than in the last
decade—and the job openings for them
will total 12.2 million. This means
900,000 people will have jobs outside
their chosen profession, some of which
may not even require a bachelor‘s
degree.

The demand for college graduates.
however, is auspiciously rising. Em-
ployers inflate the educational
prerequisites for jobs as the educational
level of society rises-jobs that once
required a high school diploma now
demand a college degree. In fact, a
surge in on-campus recruiting
throughout the country bears out this
trend. At Pitt, the number of on-campus
employer representatives increased by

17 percent last year, from 505 to 591 ,
and has doubled since 1973.

Of course there is always a job for
the motivated, talented, intelligent, con-
fident and skilled job hunter. But those

who drift through four years of college .

with little direction will have difficulty im-
pressing recruiters their career choices
were thoughtfully founded, according to
Director of University Placement Daniel
Nagy. These are the marginal students
who, despite impressive grade
averages, may be edged-out in com-
petition for a job in their chosen field.
Because an increasing’ percentage of
students indicate they go to college to
acquire specialized training often not
applicable in another field, a close look
at job probpects is wise. The em-
ployment outlook for any profession
depends largely on the potential
creation of new jobs, which, in turn,

reflect the commodity market and the
changing role of specific technologies in
society. While Pitt mining engineers are
virtually assured a job close to home,
education majors will have difficulty fin-
ding public school openings anywhere.
In journalism, as in education, a flood of
trained graduates, along with little or no
new jobs, compounds an already
desperate job situation.

“The overall employment picture
today reflects the demand for

A specialization,” Nagy said. Nearlyali
1977 Pitt engineering graduates
acquired the job of their choice, while
more general humanities degrees
proved far less marketable, according to
a survey released last January by the
career placement office.

Jobs in business and industry ac-
counted for the placement of most
specialized science and engineering
majors. in fact,
ployers——Westinghouse, U.S. Steel,
IBM, ALCOA— together hired more than
100 Pitt graduates. Of the science
majors, those in computer technology
and those qualified for monitoring of
company research programs found the
outlook for employment most favorable
in business and industry. A growing
concern for the depletion of natural
resources and energy alternatives also
accounts for the marketability of scien-
ce degrees. This is evidenced by a 100
percent placement for last Apri|’s earth
and planetary science majors.

The high employability of computer
science majors mirrors the excellent
growth potential of that field as well as
its increasing role in today's highly
technological society. Of 36 computer
science majors who responded to the
survey, 25 were professionally em-
ployed and 22 of those jobs were in
business and industry.

Don ’t All   Grads

Starve ‘ to Death?

By Martha Garvey

Everyone knows that most actors
end up starving to death- or they
become bank tellers. Joycelyn John-
son, speech and theatre arts ’77,
spent four years at Pitt telling herself
that.

‘‘I told everyone that l was going to
be a historyteacher. But if theater is
the only thing that makes you hap-
py...” ln Jocelyn’s case, it also makes
her a living.

Unlike most of the actors she
knows, Jocelyn is getting paid for what
she loves. Jocelyn is a member of the
Pittsburgh-based Theatre Express, a
company of eight young actors,
dedicated to the concept of repertory
theater. As an actor in Theatre Ex-
press, Jocelyn performs a role in each
of the compnay’s five plays, which
range from an adaptation of the
Marquis de Sade’s novel “Justine” to

a mime show to‘ a play about women in
history.

“lt’s much different from what I did
at Pitt. But l'm very satisfied with the
training I got at Pitt. I feel that the prac-
tical experience of being in shows is
really more important than, say being in
classes eight to 10 hours a
day——which is what happens at C-MU.”

Jocelyn’s life at Pitt was spent
mostly in Stephen Foster and the
Studio Theaters. She couldn't remem-
ber all the shows she’d been in, but
among the ones she remembered, she
listed, “A View from the Bridge,”
“The Marry-Go-Wrong," “Cabaret,”
“The Three Sisters” and Steel/City.
Someone saw her in a show and, on
the basis of what she calls “a good
night” gave her a job in summer stock
last May. ‘

A similar accident led to her job with
Theatre ‘Express. Connections at Pitt
told her about the auditions for Theatre
Express, for a job that started in Sep-

loves—theater.

Jocelyn attributes Pitt's size and
variety to her success. “Pitt’s like a
giant spiderweb. A lot of my Oppor-
tunities have come from people who
worked at Pitt, or who saw me in
shows there. l'm very attached and
grateful to Pitt."

Even though Jocelyn has been, as
she stressed, much more fortunate
than most actors—she doesn't plan to
leave the Pittsburgh area soon.

“Even if I don’t stay with Theatre
Express, I want to stay in Pittsburgh,

though l’ll probably have to wait tables 
or be a secretary—but I did that while I -

was at Pitt. New York is a very big
step, and it can be a big ocean where

Is she sorry she didn't become a 

history teacher?

By Rodney B. Griffith

White uniformed men and women
swarm about the round tables like bees
clustered on buds of clover. Four future
doctors play pinochle at one table, while
a first-year medical student at the next
pores over her anatomy textbook.
Three dental students sit in a slump
talking about the morning clinic while
eyeing passing pharmaceutical stu-
dents. -

Another day passes in the Scaife
Hall snack bar, which one dental
student fondly calls “the social arena.”
Here graduate students in the health
professions pass the few free minutes
they are allowed during their busy days.

“One thing that’s different from un-
dergraduate work is that dentistry
school is more like an 8-to-5 job,
especially in the first and second
years,” said Edward Halusic. “There
are no two- or three-hour breaks be-
tween classes like there are in un-
dergraduate school.”

On the fifth floor of the Cathedral, a
harried teaching assistant seeking her
master's in English writing patiently ex-
plains to her freshmen student the
weaknesses of his composition. After
finishing the conference, she grabs a
notebook from her desk and rushes to a
class of her own.

Carol Kuperstock, a graduate
student in the English program, said she
devoted 50 percent of her time to
academic work during her un-
dergraduate studies. Now she spends
about 97 percent of her time working.

“My life begins and ends in the
Cathedral," said Kuperstock. ‘‘I spend
all of my time working as a teacher or
student.”

Medical students, dental students,
English teaching assistants and

writing major, is a Pitt News staff
writer.

graduate chemistry researchers all seek

the same goal, a post-baccalaureate i

degree, but their lives in Scaife Hall, the
Cathedral and the Chemistry Building
differ greatly.

For dental student Halusic, the day
begins with a quick cup of coffee in
Scaife Hall before an 8 a.m. lecture. At

10, pre-clinic begins and Halusic shar- _ '

pens his skills on models, fellow stu-
dents or patients. After a half-hour
lunch break, he spends another two
hours in lectures until 3:30.

After afternoon lectures, Halusic
works on pre-clinic business not
finished in the morning or an orthodontic
analysis, makes a denture or gold crown
for a patient, mounts radiographs (X-
rays) or even sees a patient. To Halusic
it seems there is never enough time to
complete his clinical work.

“You can set aside a certain amount
of time for class work and get it done,
but, in the practical work, everything is
new and it's possible Murphy's law will
strike, and you will do something
wrong," he said. “You may have to try
to set a schedule, but it is too hard to
keep it because during the week
sometime something is going to go
haywire."

Another hard-working grad student,
Patty Zingg spends about 70 hours a
week surrounded by glass tubing and
bunsen burners on the 12th floor of the
Chemistry Building, working as part of
the research team under Dr. Edward M.
Arnett, studying an imposing topic,
diastereomeric interaction in
nonaqueous solvents.

Her graduate studies include little
classroom work, concentrating instead
on research.

“The department expects you
received your background of classwork
in undergraduate school, and em-
phasizes research work in the graduate
program,” she said.

Chemistry students are required to
attend only four courses, plus attend

a   Education — A atter of eee

A six month-long mini-courses. ’After'the

first year, there is no classwork unless a
student chooses to audit a class in an
area of personal interest. After seven
semesters, students must pass a com-
prehensive exam on research com-
pleted to that point. Students also of-
fer a thesis defense and present an oral

proposal on some original research not
connected with the research they are
pursuing. They finish their graduate
program within three to five years.

Zingg enjoys working in the graduate
program because she sets her own
hours. At times she works from 8 a.m.
until midnight,‘ and sometimes she
doesn't start work until noon.

As one of the few women in the
graduate chemistry program, Zingg is
faced with a double-edged dilemna.

“Thougha school might accept you
and companies hire you, there’s still
doubt whether you can do the job, and
there’s pressure on you to prove you
are capable,” she said. “Many guys

/ Life After College — An Experienced Judgment

 

  

        

expect you are going to be a wilting
flower asking them to light your bunsen
burner. You have to prove something to
them and to yourself.”

Although there are problems, Zingg
said the attitude in the program is
usually enlightened. “Most people are
very open-minded and very intelligent,
so they are not prone to the outdated
prejudices found in other places,”-she
said.

There are many reasons students
choose Pitt to do their graduate work.
The good reputation of Pitt’s graduate
programs, the relative low c6st of Pitt
since it is a state-related school,
closeness to their hometown, the
promise of lucrative careers after
graduation and_other personal reasons
draw students to Pitt.

Pitt student against an Ivy League
student any day.”

In 1941, Ruggero “Flugy” Aldisert
was Pitts’s ODK Senior Awardee,
Italian Room chairman and editor of
The Pitt News. Rugy Aldisert is now
United States Circuit_ Court judge,
chairman of the Pitt Student Affairs
Committee and a Pitt law professor.

Not suprisingly, the first change at
Pitt Aldisert mentioned was, “More
facilities. When I was an un-
dergraduate, the eighth floor of the
Cathedral housed all of the men's ac-
tivities, and the 12th floor, the
women's.

It isn't just the buildings that have
changed. According to Aldisert,
students today are more serious and
informed. with one son_ at Columbia
and another at M.l.T., the judge claims,
“There are courses at Pitt that I feel
are superior to those of the most
restigious in the country. l’d stack a

xi

As further evidence, Aldisert
described the course he teaches at
the law school.

“The course I teach, I orignally
designed for a seminar for appellate
court judges. The second- and third-
year law students I teach have no
problems with it. They’re going to
make very good judges someday.”

While at Pitt, Aldisert felt torn bet-
ween law and journalism.

“Journalism always has fascinated
me. I served my time at The Pitt News.

I was also a copyboy for the Sun-
Telegraph (now the Post-Gazette). I
worked summers at the International
Press Service. It waspretty iffy for a
while, whether I'd go into law or not.”

Aldisert does not believe that
anything at Pitt helped him make his
decision. It took World War II and the
Marine Corps to do that.

‘‘I went into the Marine Corps in the
middle of my first year at Pitt’s law
school, and the war gave me a four-
year break from the law. After the

 

regimentation of the Marine Corps, I
didn't even want to consider working
for someone else. As a journalist, I
could be subject to other people's
directions. As a lawyer, I was always
my own boss. I can honestly say I've
never worked for anyone but myself.”

In 1961 , Aldisert was elected to the
Court of Common Pleas. He remained
there until 1968, when he was appoin-
ted to the Federal Courts in
Philadephia. In the course of court
business, Aldisert visits cities across
the countryy The day he was inter-
viewed, Aldisert had visisted both
Phoenix and San Francisco. But
Aldisert is just as loyal to Pittsburgh as
he is to Pitt.

‘‘I’m a Pittsburgh native. I like the
people in Western Pennsylvania, that’s
why I stay. My job may be in
Philadelphia, but my home is in Mt.
Lebanon. I was born in Carnegie, but
I've stayed in Pittsburgh. I really
haven’t moved that far.” ‘J

Goodbye Pitt, Hello Upper Volta!

By Dave K irslmer

You don't have a job and you think
going to graduate school will be worse
than dying. Before leaping off the
Cathedral, however, there's something
you should know.

There is an altemative-the Peace
Corps. Mentioning it makes most

, students groan, walk away or gag. But

for a few working as a volunteer in a

. foreign country may be the right op-

tion.

Maureen Maloney,who graduated
from Pitt last December with a degree
in social work isn't yawning or leaping.
‘‘I can't wait," she said of her pending
trip to Ecuador as a Peace Corps
volunteer.

Like most students who join the
Peace ‘Corps today, Maureen wants
experiences in her field. “For me, the
Peace Corps offers a chance to get in-
volved in community social work,” she
explained. ‘‘I’m not as interested in
case work or in working with the
Federal Government." ’

The agency offers living expenses
ranging from $100 to $500 per mon-
th, depending on the country you work
in. An additional $3,000 relocation
allowance is given to volunteers who
complete their two-year tours.

Dave Kirshner is a Pitt News staff
writer.

Job Market :

The Peace Corps recruiting policy
changed recently, according to
Maureen. “They were only taking
people with technical skills, but now
they’ve broadened to liberal arts.”
This recruiting stance was charac-
teristic of the Peace Corps at its peak
in 1966.

Since then, the program has
declined. During the Nixon years, it

to their families, or have to stay around
the city.”

That is not Mark Herman’s problem
He’s not satisfied with life in the U.S.
“lt’s too fast,too hectic for me” he said.

"The Peace Corps came into my
plans after my aspirations to become a
veterinarian were ruined by organic
chemistry,” Mark continued. ‘‘I‘m still
lost about what I want to do."

The Peace Corps was only taking
people with technical skills, but now they ’ve

broadened to liberal arts.

was associated with the anti-war
movement, and became highly
political. Today, it is striving for a new
image.

“I’ve always had a bad view of the
Peace Corps, Maureen said. “My
opinion has changed over the last two
years.” ‘

Maureen still believes the Peace
Corps has problems, though. “A lot of
people have told me that what you end
up doing sometimes doesn’t resemble
what they originally described.”

There are many reasons why the
Peace Corps isn't the answer for
everyone, Maureen added. “Some, I
think probably have a lot more com-
mitments. They have‘ responsibilities

Mark has been cautious in
evaluating a possible two-year stint in
the South Pacific. “l’ve been talking to
a lot of people a|ready—those who've
been all over,” he said. ‘‘I heard some
had really good’ times and some had
really bad times.”

Mark has helped to run the Student
Government food co-op at Pitt, and
would like to develop a similar system
in a foreign country.

‘‘I’d like to set up a co-op in a fairly
primitive, agricultural society—not in a
country that's particularly developed,”
he explained. “Forming a co-op won't
changethe people radically. I’d really
like just working with the people.”

Empty Shelves

Mark's reasons for wanting to join
the Peace Corps are not atypical. ‘‘I’m
not ready to face the job market," he
laid. ‘‘I'd like to learn a foreign
language and maybe try and stay in
that country. And the travel—l’ve
alway dreamed about going to these
places."

If you'd rather not go to Micronesia
or Chichigalpa, then perhaps Vista
National, one of nine sister programs of
the Peace Corps, is a better choice.
Many Pitt graduates have enlisted with
Vista for renewable one-year contrac-
ts.

“The pay is lousy,” said Judy
Dowd,” but I’m really learning.”

Judy graduated from Pitt last April
with a sociology major, and couldn't
get a job. Now, she works as a Vista
volunteer at the Urban Survival Center
in Pittsburgh.

“It really gives you a view of how so
many kids can get involved with
problems,” Judy said. Judy said she
hopes having a paying job eventually
will help her to find work as a parole of-
ficer.

Peace Corps and Vista, may not be
your answer for a life after graduation.
But some Pitt students have looked
despairingly at the cathedral lawn from
the 36th floor in despair, only to realize
life after college must be lived
somewhere in Upper Volta.

(Continued from Page 4)

On the other hand, placement of the
most popular College of Arts and Scien-
ces majors; life sciences and
psychology, can be difficult, Nagy said.
These degrees become most
marketable, he explained, when enhan-
ced by graduate study in the health
fields, which are always understaffed.
In fact, more than half of those science
majors who responded to the placement
survey had entered graduate school.
It's noteworthy, however, that science
majors will have difficulty if they head for
the teaching market.

Not surprisingly, the other degree in
demand by business and industry

representatives is engineering, perhpas

the most specialized undergraduate
degree Pitt offers. The high placement
percentages for Pitt graduates parallels,
according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the apex of a cyclical job
Although the overall growth
rate for engineering jobs increases
steadily, every few years the market
experiences a temporary oversupply, as
those who rushed into engineering
school when the supply was low,
become unemployment casualties of
their own onslaught.

All chemical, electrical, metallurgical
and mining engineering graduates who
responded to the survey were either
professionally employed or in graduate
school by first choice. Pitt mining
engineers are virtually assured em-
ployment close to home, reflecting in-
dustry’s last minute efforts to squeeze
the most out of rapidly depleting land

resources, Nagy said. Civil engineering
majors experienced the lowest
placement at 78 percent, a result of a
surplus of qualified applicants in that
field.

All other percentage placements for
engineering majors were above 80 per-
cent. Moreover, the mean starting
salary for these graduates fell between
$15,000 and $18,000, with several
mining engineers starting at salaries as
high as $20,000. Comparatively, the
highest salary for science majors was
$16,000, and-the mean was several
thousand dollars lower than that for
engineering graduates.

In sharp contrast to these en-
couraging statistics, most social scien-

ces and humanities graduates encoun- i
tered difficulty landing a job. Placement’
‘in either graduate schools or jobs could

not be computed because the survey
reponse rate for these students
averaged only 35 percent, an insuf-
ficient number to compute accurate
percentages. Interestingly, the survey
response rate decreased as the em-
ployability of the major waned;
engineering majors responded 94 per-
cent of the time, science majors, 65
percent and social sciences and

— humanities majors, 35 percent.

Nagy said it is likely the poor respon-
se rate of the liberal arts students reflec-
ted a lack of enthusiasm about their em-
ployment prospects.

At an annual trade conference in
September, the nation's college career
counselors expressed grave concern
for “how to make liberal arts graduates

more employable.” The group devised
no formulaic solution, Nagy said, but did
conclude that practical experience in
the form of internships or other work
experience in one’s chosen field greatly

boosts the liberal arts major’s em-
ployabllity. Motivation is the other key
factor to success in liberal arts.
“Motivation is so important here
because liberal arts majors are generally
ignored in the job market that demands
technological specialization,” Nagy
said.

Job opportunities in finance and
banking make economics the liberal arts
degree with the brightest job prospects.
Of 106 survey respondents, 40 were
employed, 21 entered graduate school,
12 obtained temporary employment,
and 33 were unemployed, demon-

strating an overall 57 percent

placement in economics. It appears the

remaining 16 majors shared

discouraging placement results.

I’ Continued from Page 6)
Employability in the health fields is

excellent. Although the placement cen-
ter did not survey the University's health
program graduates, Nagy said em-
ployment prospects are good in the

health fields.

A projection of the 10

most promising professions for the

1980's published in Money magazine

last November illustrates this point.

Qualified doctors were speculated to be
the most_ sought-after profession.
Ranking second were actuaries, per-
sonnel administrators, city managers,
engineers and pharmacists. 7

On the other hand, school teachers,
librarians, protestant clergymen,
foresters, newspaper reporters, hotel
managers, college professors, military
officers, biologists and lawyers, the
magazine predicted, would feel the job
squeeze.

Of course, local employment
prospects do not necessarily parallel
those nationwide. Graduates willing to
relocate where the job market is plen-
tiful for their skills will have fewer job
hunting woes. According to the Pen-

nsylvania Department of Labor and In-
dustry, the following professions are
expected to ‘experience at least a 50
percent growth rate during this decade
in the Pittsburgh area, which includes,
Allegheny, Beaver, Washington and
Westmoreland Counties: operations
and systems research and analysis,
veterinarians, health practitioners,
registered nurses, dieticians,
therapists, clinical technologists, health
record technicians, dental hygienists,
therapy assistants, social scientists,

psychologists, urban and regional plan-
ners, sociologists, industrial trades,
university employees, engineering,
vocational and educational counselors,
teacher aids, air conditioning and
heating repairmen, textile workers, gar-
bage collectors, farm managers, airline
stewardesses and welfare service
aides.

A college degree will be a frill for
some of these jobs, in which on-the-job
training provides any employee with the

skills he will need. Moreover, a college
diploma will not even boost the
graduate’s starting salary in some of
tnese cases. This, however, should not
oreed discontent with the role of higher
education. Although today’s students
usually indicate they opted for college
to get a better job, there are still the
broadening and humanizing benefits of a
college education, which are often
abosrbed unconsciously py even those
who insist they came to Pitt to make
more money in the job market.

Like Cathy, many graduates will take
a job for which their college careers did
not prepared them. But this does not
mean they will be unhappy or poor, or
that their college years were wasted. In
fact, most will find, as Cathy did, the
people one works with and the at-
mosphere and tempo of the job deter-
mines in large part job satisfaction.

Then what good was Cathy's political
science degree?

“Oh, I still love poli sci. I always en-
joyed studying it and read about italot.

“No...no. I don't regret going to
college, not at all.”

0 A Matter of Degree

 

(Continued from Page 5)

Dr. Paul Gafne, associate dean of
z_a_d_n3issi_o_nsLof Pitt’s__med_ica_l school _said
medical school applicants to the school
want to study medicine because they
wish to help their fellow man; enjoy the
intellectual challenge of medicine and
desire the social position a medical
degree offers.

The chance to work for himself, to do
something creative in the world of

4 science and to work with other people

attracts Paul Brayer, a first-year medical
student at Pitt. Brayer admitted the

possible earnings appealed to him, but .

said the income was not an overriding
factor in his decision to enter medical
school

‘‘It helped (the money), but I like to
believe it wasn't a primary con-
sideration in my decision to enter
medical school,” said Brayer, who is
studying under a National Health
Professions Scholarship that will require
him to practice medicine in an im-
poverished area for two years.

For some medical school students,
the desire for money and prestige are

' driving factors, Brayer said, while others

are steered toward the career by their
parents.

“Money's up there as a reason (for
studying medicine) for a lot of people.
Prestige is too,"Brayer said. “There are
a lot of big egos in medical school. If
you want to be aloof, it’s a good way to
do it—becoming a doctor and throwing a
lot of terms at people.

“Some people do it because their

parents wanted them to do it," Brayer.

I continued. A lot of them are realizing
now at they never were positive they
wanted to go to medical school for
themselves."

Carol Kuperstock is pursuing a
graduate degree in English, fully aware

that the job market in the academic
world is bleak, She continues her
studies_in English because she loves it,
and is willing to take the chance she
may not find a job immediately after
graduation.

“I do it (pursue a career in English)
because it is what I love, and what I can
do. Maybe I won't find a teaching job,
but I have stronger impulses moving me
than that kind of fear,” said Kuperstock.

‘‘I want to be better than I am. That's
why I am here,” she said. The better I
am; the better my future will be....And
one thing's for sure. If I don't behave as
though I think success were possible, it
will never be possible at all.”

Today’s economy is tight, and many
colleges feeling the budget crunch have
slowed their growth. As a result, some
fields in the liberal arts, such as English
and history, lack the openings for
faculty that once were freely available.
Those with advanced degrees in these
areas may have a hard time after
graduation.

Advanced degrees in areas such as
social work, psychology, biology,
chemistry and physics increase the
chances of employment. M.B.A. and
law degrees once insured a comfortable
income, but both fields are becoming
bloated, with competition for jobs more
intense.

Despite the tight job market in the
academic world, there is still hope.
Pitt's small philosophy department,
which graduates about 10 students
each year, managed to place all of its
graduating students last year.

“Our program in not tailored to the
whims of the job market,” said Teddy
Seidenfeld, admissions officer for the
philosophy department’s graduate
program. “The caliber of the program is
such that anyone completing it should
be able to get a job.

Over the past few years, students
from Pitt's graduate philosophy program
have taken positions at institutions such
as-the University of California at Davis,
the University of Indiana at Bloomington,
University of Rochester, Brown Univer-
sity, University of Wisconsin, Stanford,
Brandeis, Rutgers; Penn State and
Yale.

Besides considering his chances of
employment after graduation when
thinking about graduate school, the
prospective graduate student must
consider several other factors. After 1 6
years of schooling, he must first con-
sider if he can withstand additional
years of schooling.

“l’ve seen too many people go right
to graduate school and bomb out

because they were tired of school,
taking tests and writing papers,” said
Daniel R. Nagy, coordinator of career
development and placement.

Nagy also advises a student to con-
sider whether he can afford graduate
school.

To many college seniors, graduate
school offers an escape route from the
reality of the working wond. In the end,
the escape route is circular, it tosses
students back into a world of harsh
realities. The workload in graduate
school makes one wonder whether it is
a feasible means of escape or a course
of action only for serious students with
definite career plans.
