BAS resolves to hold re-election despite conflicts

Staff Writer

The Black Action Society has
reached a decision to hold a re-
election for the positions of chair-
person and deputy—chairperson;
however, controversy within the
organization still continues, ac-
cording to two BAS members.

The decision for a re—election
was based upon 147 votes which
were thrown out by the elections
committee in the original election
when a disagreement over voter
eligibility arose.

According to sources in the
BAS, Vaughn Clagette, who lost
the original election for chairper-
son to Monique Simms, official-
ly contested

the Elections_

Committee's and the Steering
Committee's decision.

Lynette Wellington, who lost
the original election for deputy
chairperson to Melanie Berg by
25 votes, unofficialy contested
the committees. '

Hearings were conducted by
the Elections Committee Wed-
nesday night to resolve the com-
plaints of the candidates.

Two other complaints brought
against Vaughn Clagette were
also evaluated at the hearing.

Donald.Frazier, Steering Com-
mittee member, charged Clagette
with ”not conducting himself in
a business-like, professional man-
ner,” on the election day.

Clagette was found guilty of
Frazier’s charge. The committee

The Steering Com-
mittee overstepped its

power away from the

decided Clagette must write a let-
ter of apology to the chairpersons
of the Steering Committee and
Elections Committee.

Clagette was also charged with
slander against BAS member
Catherine Valentine. He ‘was
found innocent of this charge by
the committee. ‘

After-hours study area proposed

By Michele Quinn
Staff Writer

University President Wesley-
Posvar suggested yesterday that
an analysis be conducted con-
cerning the availability and need
for an after-hours study area on
campus.

”We do‘ need more quiet study
lounges,” said Conney Kimbo,
vice president for Student Affairs,

A during.yesterday’s meeting of the

Student Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee.

Posvar suggested that a survey
be conducted to find out the

number of students interested in
an area to study after the library
closes. He also recommended
researching which campus facil-
ity would be suitable for this pur-
pose.

”We realize that people don't
necessarily use the books,
microfilm and the other sources
at the library. They need a table,
a chair, good lighting and quiet,”
said Melanie Naro, SGB member.

”The problem is the expense of
keeping the building open,” said
Kimbo.

The SAAC also discussed the

dicapped students. V
Chris Booth, chairperson of th

Student Government Affirmative
Action Committee, proposed a
revision of the campus map
found in the student directory.
This map would be available to
disabled students in order to pro-
vide information concerning eas-
ier routes around campus and in

the buildings.

‘ Kimbo said the Affirmative Ac-
tion Committee, the Office of
Disabled Students andthe SGB
should meet and discuss the pos-

sibility of a revised map and other

VOLUME ElGHTY—ONE, ISSUE SEVENTY-SIX

The complaint brought by
Clagette against both the Elec-
tions and Steering Committees
served to invalidate all votes from
the original election. The com-
mittee agreed upon a re—election
as the only course of action.

”There is a 48 hour waiting
period for appeals,” said one
Elections Committee member.
”But there have not been any
more contestments [sic] as of
yet.”

The re—election will require
everyone to present a BAS mem-
bership card in order to vote.

Sources on the Elections Com-

mittee said the election problem

involved more than a question of

the validity of votes. .
”The Steering Committee over-

stepped its boundaries in taking
power away from the Elections
Committee at one point,” said an
Elections Committee member. ’’It
then gave it back tothe Elections
Committee after it made deci-
sions on various things.

”The Elections Committee is a .

sub-committee of the Steering
Committee,” the committee
member said. "The BAS constitu-
tion states that no one but the
Steering Committee has the pow-
er to. step in and decide on par-
ticular instances when a
sub-committee can not come to
a decision. This was not the case
on the night of the election.”
According to Elections Com-
mittee members, between 10 and

Escort idea scrapped
in favor of taxi service

By Teresa Candori
News Editor

Student Government Board last
night accepted a proposal to in-
itiate an SGB-funded taxi service
in place of an escort service.

According to SGB member
George Kontos, who proposed
the taxi service, the plan will be
forwarded to SGB adviser Joyce
Giangarlo and university lawyers,
who will take bids from localcab
companies.

Kontos said the service, which
should be in operation by Sep-
tember of this year, will operate
for two hours per night four
nights a week and three hours on
Saturday nights.

In other business, board mem-
ber Amy Danziger reported that
550 financial aid response cards
have been received. The cards
will be mailed in bulk to the
Senate on Wednesday.

Danziger said cards returned to
the SGB after Wednesday will
also be sent to Washington at a
later time. ‘ .

SGB President Phil Moyer
reported that he accompanied
University President Wesley Pos-
var on a lobbying trip to Harris-
burg over the weekend. Moyer
urged the Governmental Rela-

tions Committee to concentrate,

on lobbying for research funds
from the state.

”Pitt ranks49th in the union in
funding for research institutions,”

Moyer said. He urged the GRC to .

work to improve Pitt's ranking in
the area of research funding.

‘ ganized next week.

Vince Altomalre informed the
board that he is organizing an un-

dergraduate student phone direc— N

tory._ Students will receive’
information from their advisers
when they register for classes.

Allocations Committee Chair-
person Karen Bohichick remind-
ed the board that deadline for
applications for the position of al-
locations chairperson is Monday.

Kurt Toll, acting chairperson of
the Governmental Relations
Committee, reported "that Gian-
garlo had approached the GRC
about conducting a voter registra5'
tion drive for the May primaries.

According to Toll, ”time and
manpower restraints” will make
it impossible for the GRC to con-
duct a voter registration drive, but.

the committee intends to make ' V __
voter registration forms available  

to the students. .
Toll also read a letter from:

— Louis Tronzo, Pitt's vice president

for public affairs, which com-
plemented the GRC on its recent
lobbying trip to Washington."

Tronzo called the GRC ”well-  

prepared and informed.”

Reagan fails in his bid for:-congressio

WASHINGTON — The Senate
overrode President Reagan's veto
of an $88 billion highway bill to-
day 67-33, as the president failed

‘in a last-ditch bid to persuade

enough Republicans to support
him in a high-stakes showdown

with congressional Democrats.

The tense roll call came after
Reagan had spent nearly two
hours in the Capitol in private
meetings with Senate Republi-
cans, urging them to sustain both
the veto and, with it, his political
prestige.

With its two-thirds majority, the
Senate thus joined the House in
enacting the bill into law over

V Reagan's objections.

’’I want to indicate that we
fought the good fight,” Senate
Republican Leader Robert Dole

‘ said in a virtual concession of

defeat before the roll call began.

Dole said that in his meetings,
Reagan ”didn’t bend any arms,
didn’t.tvvist any arms, didn't make

any deals. He came here as the

president.” .

The measure permits the states
to raise the speed limit to 65 mph
on most stretches of interstate
highways. I

letters is announced

PHILADELPHIA — The widow
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. an-
nounced the publication Thurs-
day of the King Papers, a
12-volume collection of the civil
rights leader's published and un-
published speeches, letters and
commentary.

A 15-year venture, the project
will be sponsored by the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonvio-
lent Social Change, Coretta Scott
King said during a press con-

ference.

”Martin Luther King Jr. was not
only a great leader, he was also
a prolific author of books,
speeches, sermons, newspaper
and magazine articles,” Mrs.
King said of her husband, assasi-
nated almost 19 years ago.

Dr. Clayborne Carson, a lead-
ing scholar of the civil rights
movement and a Stanford
University historian, will serve as
senior editor of the project, Mrs.
King said. The University of

Whitehead says child
needs her real mother

RED BANK, N.J. —- The sur-
rogate mother of Baby , M,
stripped of the right to see her
child again, said she and the baby
"love each other very much” and
will not accept the judge's deci-
sion to uphold the surrogate
childbearing contract.

”There will never be a termina-
tion of the lovel have for Sara.
Nor will there ever be a termina-
tion to the need Sara has for her
real mother,” Mary Beth White-
head said in a statement.

On Tuesday, Superior Court
Judge Harvey R. Sorkow issued

‘the nation's first ruling on a dis-

puted surrogate contract. The
121-page decision upheld the
contract, awarded custody of the
year—old girl to William Stern and
his wife and barred Whitehead
from seeing her child again.

first since the ruling, Whitehead
referred to the baby by the name
she gave her after refusing to turn
the infant over to her biological
father. The Sterns have named
the baby Melissa Stern.

”We will not accept the deci-
sion of one judge as the final de-

termination of a whole society

that we should be permanently
separated," said Whitehead.

'’I believe that there is some-
thing so wrong and so harmfully
unnatural about the surrogate
practice that our New Jersey ap-
pellate courts will return Sara to
me,” she said.

Inferior housingproblems solved amicably  

By Rich Cholodofsky

For The Pitt News

One of the biggest complaints
college ‘students have is that
housing in Oakland is often in-
ferior. V -

Although some problems con-

cerning off-campus housing ‘can

become serious, most are han-
dled out of court. Cases that are
usually taken to courtare those
involving landlords who sue for
overdue rent. '

Daran Management Co., a lo-
cal real estate company that rents
to Pitt students, has experienced
these problems.

According to Bill Cramer,
property manager for Daran,

.”We maybe get three or four peo-
’ ple a year that we have to take to

I-L-— .

the legal system. Usu_allv it wo__Lks

itself out.” As a way to prevent
this from happening, Daran tries
to have the lease co-signed by the
students’ parents.

However, the biggest problem,

according to Cramer, is student

parties. ‘
”We try to handle this by call-
ing the tenant in for a conference

'[to] work out the problem. There
‘aren't too" many ‘problems be-

cause we are pretty selective with
most of our tenants.’We also try
to avoid any problems by not
making promises we_can’t keep,”
said Cramer.

' Landlords are not the only ones
with problems, though. Tenants
say they have their fair share, too.

Jeff Lauer, a Pitt student and
Oakland tenant, said that he has

experienced problems with his
_ landlord‘. '

”There is either no heat, or it

. ' . ”The landlord is just concerned

with the outside of the building

' and hasn't done anythingon the

inside/"said Lauer.
Another student, Ken Mit-
tereder, said thathe‘ is having

‘similar problems.

‘’’I couldn't move in right away.
I had to stay at a friend's house,
and my roommate had to stay at

‘home for three weeks while the
‘landlord painted and did minor

repairs. The apartment is the
same now as it was when I
moved in. The landlord has made
no repairs,” said Mittereder.
The situation had gotten so bad
that Mittereder had to bring in the
health department four or_five

’’In the end, I think that it is bet-
ter to have the health department
handle the situation," said Mit-
tereder. '

David Greve, a spokesman for
Charles S. Greve and Co., -Lauer
and 'Mittereder’s landlord,
defended his company's position.
‘ .”There wereminor things that

‘neededto-‘be taken care of,'and

when the health department
came, they found some other
things wrong.

"They sent a letter to me say-
ing that I will be fined unless I
make the repairs. I wrote them
back and told them that we'll do
whatever needs to be done. As far
as I'm concerned, we've taken
care of everything that needs to
be done,” said‘ Creve‘. ‘

Greve said that the’ problem
started in September when the his
company bought the building
from another real estate compa-
ny, with ”deficiencies we didn't
know about.”

However, Greve said that most
of the tenants are satisfied a_nd,

because the building is very old,
they try to do the best they can.

”Looking back at what has‘hap-
pened, I've realized that what
you have to do is do a better job
of looking,” said Mittereder ’’It
has been an" incredible ex-'
pe_rience.’f ’ ' '-

,- There‘ are .m_easur_es students

can take to protect themselves.
Mark Galzerano, attorney for the
5GB, suggested such things as
reading through the lease and
noting provisions about security
and what happens if you have to
move away early. He also sug-
gested that if the student has a
lease, he should go through the
lease first and make a note to the
landlord, in a writing, of any
problems that are found.

The Off-Campus Housing.
Office, besides offering a list of
landlords, can be helpful to stu-
dents by assisting them in obtain-
ing legal advice. They have: lists
of law agencies and records of
student complaints against
landlords. ' V

It was the only  
decision to make

Surrogacy is now legal in New Jersey, according to Superior
Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkow. In a 121-page ruling read to
the court, Sorkow declared that he was creating law.

, ”To make _a new concept fit into an old statute makes tor-
tured _law with equally tortured results,” "Sorkow held in the
decision. ' ' .

In a ruling that is seen to be a test case for the legality of sur-
rogate parent contracts, the ruling has been for the father, based
on what Sorkow defined as ”the best interest of the child.’’

He also held that there was no exploitation involved and that
the contract signed was legally binding.

Since the baby was biologically the father's, he was not pur-

chasing a child. ”He cannot purchase what is already his,”.. the
judge reasoned. ' H '

As a court precedent, some legal analysts hold that it will
have virtually no effect outside New Jersey. There is an effect,
though, from the debate the case has started.

Around the nation, there has been an interest in this case as
a discussion of the legal rights of a woman to her own child.
The main opposition has held that the mother is, in effect, sell-
ing her rights to the baby.

That, as Sorkow has decided, is simply not the case. He cited
the. fact that there are no legal restrictions on procreation by
natural means, and it is beyond the rights of the court to im-
pose restrictions on reproduction by any other means.

It is refreshing to see that there is at least one court not will-
ing to impose itself on what, by nature, is a very personal deci-
sion. There is no prior committment on the part of the mother.
She voluntarily chooses to be impregnated, and before she does,
she chooses to relinquish her rights to the child.

Sorkow’s decision is consistent with the personal freedoms
provided us in the Constitution and is a victory for the progres-
sive population. We look to the government to limit the con-
-trol it has over our lives, and we should readily embrace any
decisiongiving us more control of our bodies.

The Gipper loses
some credibility

The‘Senate, in a stroke of what smells dangerously like

democracy, voted to override the Gipper’s veto of the $88 bil-
lion highway bill.

The president, who publicly stated that he was staking his
political credibility on the measure, certainly must have been
surprised to learn what nearly everyone else suspected.

Our congressmen, in a refreshing change of attitude, chose
overwhelmingly to vote for the interests of their constituents
and not for the improved image of a morally impoverished
president.

If it is truly important for the president to posture for the Ameri-
can people by fighting with his Congress, he deserves nothing
Iess than our full condemnation.

The instances of consideration for the people of the country
are too few and must be applauded‘. Ours is a government for
the beneﬁt of the people and the country, not for our chosen
servants. ‘ . .

Q i it

Everyone has,_ at one time o_r
another, had an idol. When you
were younger, there was proba-
bly someone you wantedto ”be
just like” when you grew up.

When I was little, I didn't want
to grow up to be like my dad, I
wanted _to be my dad. Although

he wasn't the only idol I had, he
was the only one who lasted.

Maybe idol is a little strong.
Hero ‘might be a better word to
use, but it really doesn't matter
what you call the personwho has
earned your respectand admi-
ration.

Childhood is the time when
you first become aware of want-
ing to be something —— not just in
terms of being a doctor or a law-
yer, but in terms of character. It
is at this point in your life that you
usually find someone you want to
emulate.

Sports figures, actors and ac-
tresses always seem to rank high
on the list. That's not surprising.
The media creates a powerful pic- _
ture of them. They are given the

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, April 3, 1987

Killer bees are coming!

On page 62 of the April 6
Newsweek, there's an article that
looks like something out of
Weekely World News.

”lNVASlON OF THE KILLER
BEES!” it reads. Yeah, right. And
if I believe that, I'll believe Big-
foot's going to be on Donahue
next week and that AIDS is a
Communist plot. Aside from the
sensational headline, the article's
pretty interesting, not to mention
alarming;

The story of the killer bees goes
something like. this: 1

For as long as apiculture (bee-
keeping) has existed in Brazil, all
of the bees in Brazil have been
descendants of bees imported
from Europe. The European bees
were good honey-makers, but
they were too sensitive to the
Brazilian environment, and,
therefore, weren't as dependable
as bees should be.

In 1957, a group of apicul-
turists in Brazil imported a few
hundred bees from Africa. It was
known that African honey bees
were a hardy lot and were more
tolerant of environmental fluctu-
ations. The Brazilian apiculturists
wanted to breed the African bees
with the transplanted European
bees and come up with a hybrid
that was both hardy and a good
honey-maker. But as with so
many brilliant plans, there was a
tragic flaw.

The African bees were notori-
ously mean. They attacked in-
truders in swarms, they stung
many times more often than most
honeybees, and they tended to
extend their range quickly. In
Africa, these bees have many pre-
dators, which explains both their
temperment and the fact that they

You want

Why and thunder should Penn-
sylvania. decriminalize grass?
Here, gone and done again, is the
explanation. This is a proclama-
tion to see the devil through for
those with friends of friends that
willy-nilly smoke some dope
now and then. Not only was it
right to ignore the lynch law of
having your friends of friends
dragged through the tedious ritual
of civil litigation for toking that
doobie, you were acting on-_be-
half of the only reasonable act of
justice left in the currently very
reduced circumstances of the
notorious Republic —- the act of
deﬁance. ‘

To sermonize on the situation
now is to also, in the same
breathilizer,_p|ay hell with the lu-
dicrous incompetence of our law-
makers. While in so doing,
demonstrating that the lousy atti-
tude of said lawmakers translates
directly — do not pass Go — into
homicidal and genocidal tactics
just down the road. The CIA is
ma_ssacring Christians on
Brazilian slopes to keep you feel-
ing guilty about that kid down the
hall firing up a contraband.

To be pricelessly heavy: Just
laws do not guarantee just penal-
ties when broken, so when you
concur with the scare-mentality
platform of the hysterical crusade,
you will still scoff atthe tactics
used to prevent dope use. D_rugs

haven't spread out of control.
The hybrid produced from the

African and Brazilian bees was
much -less successful than had

been hoped. They didn’t‘make.

much honey and weremean, but-
they were also extremely hardy.
No problem so far,because all of
this had taken place in , a
laboratory. .

One day, a few of the "bad"

African bees escaped. The es-
caped bees began breeding with

B "good" Brazilian bees, and be-

fore too long, Brazil was being
overrun with "bad" hybrids.
These hybrids wouldtake over
domestic and wild beehives, kick
out the residents and set‘ up
housekeeping, thus decimating
the Brazilian honey industry. ’

Agriculturists depend on honey
bees for their honey, of course,
but they also depend on the bees
to pollinate fruit trees. The
hybrids were terrible pollinators,
so the fruit-growing industry was
suffering, too.

The bees "are called killer bees
because of their tendency to at-
tack in swarms. When a hive is

disturbed, instead of a few bees
leaving the hive to drive off the
intruder with their stings, the en-
tire hive attacks en masse. This is
where their threat lies. The killer
or, more exactly, "Africanized"
bees are no more venomous than
the honeybees on Flaggstaff Hill,
but there is safety in numbers,
and thesebees know it.

.So far it seems’ as if this is a
Brazilian problem, but it‘ isn't.
Since their release in the wild, the
Africanized bees have been
migrating northward at 300 miles
a year.-Yikes.

The Africanized bees are ex-
pected to reach southern Texas
somewhere between 1989 and
1991. They're in Costa Rica now,
and last July, a University of
Miami student was killed by a

-swarm there. A post mortem

reported approximately 45 stings
on every square inch of his body.

Should these bees ever make it

here, the United States will wind -

up in the same situation Brazil's
in. No more honey, and no more
fruit trees.

There is hope. The USDA has
a proposal to halt the bees in
southern Mexico’. Called the

' "bee zone,” it would try to pre-
vent the bees from going any fur- '

ther north through inspections of
northbound shipments and
through judicious use of pesti-

cides. The plan will cost $10 mil- _

lion. The USDA hasn't even
asked for the money yet. Unless
work begins this summer, the
bees will be unstoppable. Some-
thing has to be done.

Patricia Murphy, 24, lives
in Arlington Heights, III.,
and commutes every week-
day to Davidson Marketing,
Inc., in suburban North-
field, where she is a
copywriter.

"I'll drive along Dundee
Road," she said, "and ev-
ery day, I pass this church.
For the last six or seven
months, I have been pass-
ing it, and I never fail_to no- ’
tice the church's signboard.

"There are these sayings  
on the signboard. The say-
ings change every week.
And I don't know —- the sayings really dosomething for me.
For a while I was pretty down — my mother was ill — and those
sayings began to brighten my life."

 

. "I foundmyself driving‘ past the-ch-u'rch.on purpose. I«:w‘rote..
down some of the sayings I liked best. One was ‘Thanksgiving A

— Not Thanks Gimme.’ One was ‘Loneliness is Homesickness
for God.’ One,was ‘Coincidence is God Incognito.’

''Finally, I called the church to tell them how much I liked A

the signboard. It was obvious that someone was paying a lot
of attention to putting those signs up every week. I just wanted
to leave word that someone was reading them.”

The church is the North Northfield United Methodist Church,
and one person does indeed serve as author of the signboard.
Patricia Murphy never spoke with him, but he is Patrick Stubbs,

3-7, a church member who is also a chief petty. officer at the _

Glenview, Ill., naval air station. . .

"That’s very flattering, that she would like my work," Stubbs
said. "I teach fifth- and sixth-grade Sunday school classes at the
church, and I've been doing the signboard for six years.

"The pastor used to do it, but in February of 1981 he put out

the word that he'd like someone to take the job over. I was r I

recovering from two ruptured disks in my back, and I decided
that if I could climb the ladder, then I'd take over the responsi-
bility."

Since then, Stubbs has posted more than 300 sayings on the
signboard. None advertises the church; all are intended as in-_

spirational messages directed at the thousands of motorists who .

drive by every day. s _ _ V V I A . .-
"I get the sayings everywhere,” Stubbs said. "People tell me

things, or I'll read a book or a magazine, I'll see a good thought _

that takes up a paragraph, and I'll start thinking of ways to short-
en it into a sentence so that it will fit on the signboard.

"The signboard has five lines, and each line will hold up to
13 letters. I guess I'm an editor, really; I have to boil thoughts
down. A lot of times people will give me an idea for the sign-
board, and I'll say, ’That won't, fit but ...' I'm already editing
in my mind."

Stubbs said that his main goal is to provide something for the
passing motorists to think about — something to make them
feel good. ''I don't feel -like an author,” he said. "I feel like a
servant of God." , ‘ '

He usually changes the sign after dark. "There’s a closet right
inside the back door of the church," he said. "All of the metal
letters for the signboard are stored in the closet, and the ladder
is in there, too. ‘

"|'|l already have the week's message written down on a piece I

of paper. Then I'll turn the spotlight on the signboard, and I'll
put the message up as quickly as I can. The reason I hurry is

that I don't want people to see me. It would be too vain to stand ,

there and -have people look at me." -

He said he has several favorite messages from over the years..
One of them is, _"God’s Calling: Has Your Phone Been Busy?"
Another is, ”Feel Far From God? Guess Who Moved?" I

Although Stubbs has never put his own name on the sign-
board — I don't have that kind of an ego” — he saidthat it makes
him happy when someone from the church on Sunday walks
up to him and says, "I didn't know you were the one who puts
up the signs.” He was especially glad to to learn that Patricia
Murphy had taken the time to call the church and inquire about
the signs. '’I know a lot of cars go by the church, but usually
there's no way of telling i_f the messages on the signboard real-
ly reach a person," he said. I , ' _

Stubbs said that even after six years of being responsible for
the sign every week, he has never considered turning the job
over to someone else. '’I wouldn't want to do that," he said.
''I enjoy it too much. The signboard not only ministers to the
motorists who are driving by, it ministers to me when I'm
depressed or lonely.”

It‘ has become second nature forhim to jot things down at
any hour of the day or night; at the end of a week, he'll look
at his jottings and decide on what the message will be for the
next seven days.

"If I could be, I'd be Billy Graham," Stubbs said. "But that's .-

never goingto happen. So I'm happy reaching people through

the signboard. It's nice to know that once in a while, someone .
notices."  .. ,. V . , . j ;

  Neural transplants offer hope

for Parkinson’s disease victims

By Malcolm Ritter
Associate Press Writer

NEW YORK —~ Researchers
have taken a big step in treating
Parkinson's disease by showing
significant improvement in two
patients who underwent trans-
plants of gland cells to their
brains, a scientist says.

”With this report, neural .trans-
plantation is with us as a possi-_
ble mode of therapy,” Di: Robert
Y. Moore, chairman of the neu-

~rology department at the State
University of New York at Stony
Brook, wrote in today's New En-
gland Journal of Medicine.

But he and other scientists said
more investigation is needed.

His editorial accompanied a
study by Mexican scientistsvof
two Parkinson's patients who un-
derwent surgery to transplant
cells from their adrenal glands,
which lie just above the kidney,
into their brains.

Before surgery, one 35-year-old

patient had needed help to eat
and walk even a few steps, but he
now feeds himself, visits a clinic
by himself and holds a job tend-
ing pigs, said researcher Dr. Rene
Drucker-Colin. '
”The patient still has a slight
tremor, he sort of limps a little
bit,” said Drucker—Colin in a tel-
ephone interview. ”|t’s not a 100
percent recovery. That's impossi-
ble, I think.” ' ,
Drucker—Colin is head of the
neurosciences department-at the
institute of Cellular Physiology of
the National Autonomous
University of Mexico in Mexico
City. He reports the work with
Dr. Ignacio Madrazo of La Raza,
part of the social security_hospi-
tal system in Mexico City, and
with other scientists.
Parkinson's disease, often
characterized by tremors, rigidi-
ty or loss of balance, afflicts an es-
timated 350,000 people in the
United States. Drugs can control

symptoms, but their effects can

' be sporadic and side effects can

include psychological distur-
bances and impairment of
movement.

The disease results from the
lack of a chemical called dopa-
mine in a certain area of the
brain, because of the death of
dopamine-producing cells. Brain
cells use dopamine to communi-

~-cate with each other.

Adrenal cells were transplant-
ed because they also produce
dopamine.

Drucker—Colin said the 35-year-
old patient has continued his im-
provement sincethe surgery in
March -1986, without need for

‘medication. The second man, 39,

who had the surgery last Oc-
tober, continues to show a major
reduction in what had been an in-
capacitating tremor, he said.
Eight later surgery patients also
seem to be showing gains, he
said.

Graduate students
to hold Research
Colloquium today

By Bob Safran

For The Pitt News

The Council of Graduate
Students in Education is hold-
ing the 12th annual Student
Research Colloquium today in

« Forbes Quadrangle._

The colloquium features 21
students who will be_ giving
research presentations. Chair-
person _Tommie Nell Taylor
said that the general theme of
the program involves ”where
education in America is going
in terms of students, faculty
and administrators.”

”Most of the presenters are
graduate students working
toward their doctorates,” Tay-
lor said.

,’’One of the co|loquium’s_
goals is to show that the
School of Education does»
professional work and profes-
sional research," Greg Sane

Nicholas, a member of the or-
ganization, said.

”lt’s a way of showing
everyone what we are doing,"
he said. ”The School of Edu-
cation has taken a lot of criti-
cism.  The colloquium is
trying to show that we're not
just sitting around.

’/We hope that what we are
doing in research will have
practical application.”

The student research presen-
tations are scheduled from
8:30 a.m. to 6:30 pm. -

Charles Stegman Ph.D. and
Naomi Zigmond Ph.D. will
open the program with discus-
sions on: ”The Role of
Research in the Prepartion of
Doctoral Students” and
”Redefined: More Questions
than Answers.”

Dean Thomas Labelle will
deliver the closing remarks on
”Research and Education.”

Hearing impairment is the
single most chronic disability
in the United States, second
only to heart disease, accord-
ing to Jeff Pannier, coordina-
tor of the fourth annual Deaf
Awareness Day.

The University of Pitts-

burgh's sign language club,
Sign Connection, sponsored
Deaf Awareness Day Monday
in the Assembly Room of the
William Pitt Union.

Karen Walkney, instructor of
sign language classes at Pitt
and deaf since birth, founded
the club in 1982.

’’I am pleased with the sup-
port I've’ gotten from my stu-

Without them, l’m nothing,”
said Walkney.

Walkney’s sign language
class enrollment has risen
from five students when it was
first offered to 187 students.
Sign language now satisfies
the CAS foreign language re-
quirement and is available as
a minor.

made him both optimistic and

Relatively few Parkinson's pa-

results may not apply to older pa-

Dr. Eugene Redmond, director

recess before deciding whether
the 147 votes would be valid.
The following day, the Steering

its job and was not able to come
to a decision,” an Elections Com-
mittee member said. ’’It wasn't

time to set up.

”We will work on the taxi serv-
ice over the summer and hope-
fully implement it in September

During the SAAC meeting, the
raise of the studentactivities fee,
the student health fee and tuition
rates were also discussed.

Phil Moyer, president of the
SGB, informed the administration
members of the proposed raise of
the student activities fee.

' Moyer said the raise is partly
due to the $158,000 discrepan-
cy between the amount of money

ally has to allocate.

cussed during the SAAC meeting. C"

The blind leadsthe blind  

/\/loon/ig/it/'ng’s Bruce Wil

By Ike Shibley

Blind dates are usually events
in life that are put out of mind.
Often, they ruin an evening and
rarely do lasting relationships

develop from them. In short,-

they are usually disastrous.
Blind Date, a new Blake Ed-

lfward’s film, holds true to its

name in at least this respect —
it is a disaster. It is one film that
I desperately want to forget.

This film is supposed to high-'

lightthe slick, likeable personal-
ity of Bruce Willis. He plays
Walter, a financial consultant
who drives a nice car and is do-
ing very well for himself.
Walter is the same character

that David Addison is on Moon-

/ighting. l assume that Willis was
chosen for this role because of
the similarity of Walter to the
character he plays on TV.
Unfortunately, David Addison
is infinitely more likeable than
Walter. There is no character
development in the movie that
gives a reason for liking Walter.
He is never understood and,
conseguently, never genuinely
appeaing. And this is just the
beginning ofTthis film's problems.
The story is unappealing. My
date leaned on my shoulder af-
ter an hour and asked if we had
to stay. l told her that it was my
responsibility as to critic to en-
dure the entire length of the film,
at which point she moaned
something inaudible and sank

 

down into her seat.

I tried to analyze what was
wrong with the film as l sat there
sharing her emotional response.
lvlidwgy through the movie, I

decided that l was viewing it

had directed a slapstick come-

, dy — thus, I asked myself: How

much plausibility can l expect?

Thatalteration of view did-

nothing to enhance my enioy-
ment. Even when watched as a

This film is supposed
to highlight the slick,
likeable personality of
Bruce Willis. He plays
Walter, essentially the
same character as
David Addison on
Moonlighting. I assume
that Willis was chosen

for this role because of

the similarity of Walter
to the character he
plays on TV.

Unfortunately, David
Addison is infinitely
more likeable than

The reason it was not funny is
due to character development.

from the wrong perspective. I
was trying to extract too much.

There was nothing realistic
about the film, but perhaps that
was deliberate. Possibly, a
detailed analysis of this film was
both impractical and im-
plausible. .

l was aware that Edwards

slapstick comedy, it was still dis-
astrous. ' ~

The main problem was that it
simply was not funny.

The audience must have

and still find a movie enioyable,
but not in a comedy. There is no
impetus to even smile when you
don't care about the players in
the story.
To specify;

0 John Laroquette‘s character,
David (ironically) is completely
useless. He is despised from the

start on account of his inane ac-
tions. He is not funny, he's
pathetic (and yes, there is a
difference).

0 David's father, who‘ is in-
troduced as a judge ruling over
a case in which his son is a law-
yer (quite an asinine situation, in
itself), is idiotic. There was no
reason to introduce him into the
script. It complicated the story
unneccesarily. Not only that but,
like everyone else in the film, he
was not funny.

I Kim Basinger, portraying Na-
dia Gates, did not look as good
as she has in the past. However,

her acting was horrid as usual."

Her character was drunk for
the first half of the film, but her
performance was not convinc-
ing. Consequently, she was also
not believable sober. Her
character was a ditz throughout
the film — she was neither likea-
ble nor funny. _

There is too much material
here. The story becomes too
complicated for a simple come-

’ dy. lt tackles too many subjects

in an attempt to create more hu-
mor. In doing so, it accomplish-
es just the opposite — it destroys
what little humor existed.

Blind Date is a complete
failure. The worst blind date im-
aginable would be more fun,
and much more interesting,‘than
this movie. - .

On a scale of l to l0, this film
rates a l. ‘

Concrete Blonde aren't °ust over-sensitive street unks  
l

CONCRETE BLONDE
Graffiti
Tuesday, March 24

By Dave Zafris

Concrete Blonde is a con-
tradiction.

Whether they're playing
"Can Make Me Cry” (an
acoustical love ballad) or "Still
in Hollywood" (a salute to the
hardcore seen of their native
LA.) or covering "Beware of
Darkness" (George Harrison's
philosophical religious murmur),
the band delivers a set full of
highs and lows.

Singer/songwriter and bass
player Johnette Napolitano
jumped around on stage like a
little girl at her 5th birthday party
— while she was adorned in a
slinky black next-to—nothing most
women would wear as under
rather than outer wear.

Although her voice has been
compared and compared and
compared to that of Chrissy
Hynde, the sultry singer has a
vocal range more similar to Ja-

    

nis Joplin (one of her biggest in-
fluences) — without Janis’
scruffiness.

The Affordable Floors opened
the Graffiti show, giving their

usual pop/double synth perfor-
mance. The band proved that
they are the best in Pittsburgh at
playing their kind of music.
The songs off the Floors’ cur-

rent LP, The Sounding, would
greatly accentuate characters in
a John Hughes film.

When Concrete Blonde came
on, Napolitano was obviously

concert Preview:
The Toll
Tonight at The Decade

By Mike Hunt

The Toll isn't the kind of
band whose audiences sing
along with the vocalist. That's
because no one would know
what words to sing — Brad
Circone, the band's singer,
creates the lyrics as he goes
along.

''I improvise the lyrics night
after night. I don't use any
cheat sheets. It's more fair to
the audience —— it's unjust to
play the some show every
night," commented Circone.

Yet, the band uses the
same chorus and the same

The Decade

we/comes back The Toll

hooks each performance.

The Toll’s unique perfor-
mances caught the eye of
Psychedelic Furs member Tim
Butler. Butler offered to
produce The Toll’s first album.

"We were playing at
CBGBS in New York, and Bu-
tler's wife Debbie saw us.
We loaded her down with
three or four different demo
tapes, and Tim offered to
produce us," Circone said. '

Butler took time off from the
Furs to get to know The Toll.

' He lived with the four band-

members in their Columbus,
Ohio, apartment for three
weeks, so he could get a feel
for their mood.

"We got a gig at The Ritz
in New York, and Butler was

egoless enough that he stood
with the rest of the au-
dience," said Circone.

Circone said that Butler
wanted to catch the energy
of a live Toll performance on
record. Like many bands in-
spired by the great punk ex-
plosion of l977, Circone said
that the band members got
the guts to pick up a guitar
after hearing hardcore.

"But we don't sound like a
hardcore band. We try not to
sound like anybody. I like to

primed for the show. She
seemed to find even the smallest
thing infinitely hilarious.

The experienced guitar work
of Jim Mankey controlled the

mood behind Napolitano's sen- ‘ '

sitive street-punk lyrics. And Har-
ry Rushakoff's drumming on
"Beware of Darkness" punctu-
ated Monkey's short guitar
bursts without making the song
sound too dinosaurish.

”Can Make Me Cry” fea-
tured Napolitano's romantic
side and was delicately accom-
panied by Mankey's acoustic
strumming.

The band displayed their
diversity with "Still In Holly-
wood," as the Graffiti crowd
erupted into some contrived
slam dancing.

Napolitano's ‘rich singing
made it seem like she had three

back—up singers, despite the fact .

that the show was the last in the

. (Tous les Garcons s’appellent Patrick)

FRANCE, 1958. WITH: JEAN-CLAUDE BRIALY.

' Patrick is energetically "on the make in all directions, but the ambiguity that results from
trying to be everywhere at once does him in. First, he comes on strong with Veronique;
then, he turns up his nose at Charlotte. In the end, Patrick, as the love-them-and-leave-

e them-lover; who is ﬁnally humbled, is the hero of an adventure that is lived out in the

l utmost freedom, ease, casualness, and something that even approaches grace.

CRITICS I AWARDS: "‘ ...Tous les Garcons s’appellent Patrick is a witty and
sophisticated conversation in the form of a “News of the Week” of love. It exhibits max-

arco’s_manite§tations

ln this play, the West is pure-.

ly a material society, one that
masks its inner being and re-
mains concerned only with phys-
ical rewards.

/\/larco A/ii//ions begins with
young Marco Polo preparing to
embark on a journey from his
home of Venice to the Far East,
exploring both himself and hu-
man nature along the way.

Christopher Jones, in his MFA
thesis role, gives Marco a
boyish innocence that eventually
matures into a lust for material
wealth. Jones’ portrayal of
young Marco is quite enter-

. taining.

Eventually, though, lvlarco
changes from a mere boy to a
shrewd, self'centered, success-
ful man —— successful because of
his material wealth. lvlarco be-

comes a haunting replication of
the forces that drive capitalist so-
ciety. Jones’ compelling perfor-
mance sheds light on the motives
of the Western man.

‘Mary Jo Kelly is endearmg as
the young Kukachin. Always
looking as if she'd rather be
ducking behind a fan, Kelly

gives the Oriental princess ay

pureness that charms everyone
except lvlarco — her infatuation.

l\/larco's other admirer and his
wife-to-be loves him for his mil-
lions. Keeping behind her half-
mask, Donata (portrayed by
Camille J. Hallstrom) embodies
the characteristics of the glut-
tonous West. Hallstrom plays
the shallowness of her kind as
she hungrily feds off Marco's
wealth. .Hallstrom's understand-

East meets the decadent West in Eugene O'Neill's drama

ing of herlcharacter and perfor-
mance are outstanding.

Not so outstanding in his per-
formance is Scott Lee Denier as
Chu—Yin, a sage. lt is difficult to
take his whining attempt at play-
ing an old man seriously.

On the other hand, Daniel
Frezza as the Great Kahn is
heartwarming. He cares for his
lovely granddaughter Kukachin
with a loving admiration.
Frezza's honesty and warmth in
the role are moving.

Costume designer Lorraine
Venberg and scene designer
Henry Heymann together create
a visually enticing stage. The
contrasting bright costumes of
the principle characters add
flavor’ to the vanilla flats with
charcoal landscapes.

Percussion's answer to Tchaikovsky

SAFETY IN NUMBERS
David Van Tieghem
Private Music

By Douglas Wombat Payne

Percussionist David Van
Tieghem emanates from the
some iconoclastic Soho scene
that produced rock drummer An-
ton Fier, mod saxists Time Berne
and Peter Gordon, experimen-
talist composer John Zorn and,
of course, pop sensation Laurie
Anderson.

Von Tieghem’s i984 debut
solo album, These Things Hap-
pen on Warner Bros. Records,
served as an evocative score to
o Twyla Thorpe ballet on Brood-
way and followed an intense
employment period (i979-85)
as a member of Laurie Ander-
son's bond.

in Anderson's band, Von
Tieghem utilized his ”ploy any-
thing” philosophy of percussion
by playing conventional drums
such as the tympani, Rototoms
and the steel drums, to the less
conventional state—of—the-art
bowls, plywood and linoleum
floors.

i985 also saw the release of
his own video, in which he liter-
ally played New York City. Be-
ginning in lower Manhattan,
Van Tieghem is seen performing
percussive wizardry on walls,
metal doors, sidewalks, win-
dows, cars, manhole covers
along with an occasional fire
hydrant interlude.

The concept sounds ridiculous,
but it works; this drummer is not
only rhythmically inspired, he's
visually entertaining as well.

Late i986 then saw the bi-
zarre release of his cult hit re-
make of Iron Butterfly’s stupid
’’In A Gadda Do Vida" on a
very small New York label.

Equally as bizarre was the on-
nouncement of his signing with
the New Age label, Private
Music, around that time.

Private Music, whose fancy
product is sufficiently overpriced,
seems to be a haven for rock's
”hos—beens” who want to ride
the New Age kundalini express.

Prime examples include folkie
Leo Kottke, post-lvlohivishnu
violinist Jerry Goodman, ex—King
Crimson keyboardist Eddie Job-
son and Private Music founder,
ex-Tangerine Dream member

and failed solo new-wove rock- ‘

er, Peter Baumann.
Fortunately, Safety in Num-
bers cannot at all be regarded
as condescending or as light-
heoded as New Age often is.

Certainly, this is not Von-

Tieghem’s medium, and he
knows enough about his musical
palette to create not only dra-
matic scores, but quirky and,
alas, even engaging aural
panoramas.

The scope of his talent lies in
his ability to orchestrate, much
in the way Tchaikovsky did, and
to manipulate the entirety of his
musical assets to create the
cinematic impact his music has.

As most of the songs on this ol-
bum represent a handful of
comissioned pieces for the
Boston Ballet, the Pennsylvania
Bolle‘ and a Broadway produc-
tion of The A/chemedion, Safe-
ty in Numbers is most often
successful, as a sort of sound-
track. Thus, Safety in Numbers
best chronicles the composer's

ability to guide transitions into
appropriate musical shades with
a conceptually percussive ap-
proach to style.

”Future” utilizes the some
sense of Philip Gloss—styled os-
tinato in more narrative musical
flourishes, most reminiscent. of.
Steve Reich's recent work, Six-
teen /\/larimbas. "Skeleton
Key," though, is an intruiging
dance piece which, curiously
enough, sounds like a skeletal
backdrop awaiting incisive
Laurie Anderson witticisms.
These songs seem’ to hint at a
well-defined song structure

Please see Numbers. Dage lb

R.E.M.’s newest LP
won't be so new

' .~_\_‘_\.€\\\~\§
 

   
     

AW

Robyn Hitchcock has been picked up by A&lVl Records. We
should be hearing a new LP from Robyn very soon.  Jonathan
Richman buzzed through town recently. He's known for living in
his own little modern world. When he performs, Jonathan invites
you in and makes you forget anythin bad. It was truly an ethereal
experience.  Los Lobos has cancel ed its scheduled appearance
toni ht because of a death in a band member's family.  Pittsburgh
will e inundated with UK bands in the near future. Included are
The Mission U.K., Billy Bragg, We've Gotta Fuzz Box and We're
Gonna Use It.  Another band recently here, flREHOSE, had all
the energy and competence of The Minutemen, plus a fresh, youth-
ful twist. Opening band D.C.3 (featuring former members of Black
Flag) shook the Electric Banana with a sort of Black Flag-meets-
Deep Purple sound. Don't miss either of these bonds it they come
to the 'burgh again.  Speaking of Deep Purple, the mid—70s
pop/ rock combo Sweet will be reuniting with Ritchie Blackmore pen-
ning tunes for them. Verrry strange.  R.E.M. will be releasing an
LP entitled Dead Letter Oﬁfice. It will include B—sides and difficult to
find tracks. The Athens guys went into the studio yesterday to be—
gin recording new material. Dead letter Office should be availa-
ble the first week of May.  Semi-gothic-psychedelia is what The
Cult’s new stuff seems not to be. If the single ”Love Removal
Machine" is any indication of what their upcoming LP E/ectrio is
going to be like, it'll sound more like Bachman-Turner-Overdrive. 
See ya next week for what could be the /ast SHOWCASE ever--
don’t let it happenl!

Van Tieghem also explores
Oriental musical prospects in his
cinematic style on ”Thunder Liz-
ard," "Night of the Cold

Prayer.”

However, this is how he ex-
poses his basic compositional
weakness.

These three songs in particu~

Vangelis), a film that compli-

he treads that dangerous ground

cute amalgam of new-age and
new-wave, plays off a Harold
Faltermeyer type of synthesizer
manipulation and a Mark lsham
ability for aural, dramatic stasis.

However, the most stunning
piece on the album remains the
ethereal mood piece "Crys-
tals." As a dialogue between
the marimba and a wonderfully
haunting piano, Van Tieghem
tiptoes through his ability for ex-
pression in a light iazz context.
This piece alone is worth the
price of the album.

lt is interesting that the range
of modern musical styles Van
Tieghem has grasped places him
in the ranks of the foremost
American composers such as
John Adams, Steve Reich and
Philip Glass.

Safety in Number won't
change your life, but it should be
interesting to follow the avenues
Van Tieghem intends on pursu-
ing in the near future. He might
turn out to be a jewel buried in
downtown New York who has,
thus far, made music that only
appeals to musicians and a

select handful of fans.

Track team aiming forbig outdoor season

By Sam Tallarico
Staff Writer

The Pitt "men's track team
traveled to North Carolina State
last weekend to compete in the
Atlantic Coast Relays.

if this meet was any indication

of what is to come, look for this‘

team to have a successful outdoor
season.

Senior Tim Manes came away
with first place in the 800-meter
run with a time of 1:48.22. He
was two-hundreths of a second

off for qualifying for nationals.
Junior Lee McRae placed se-
cond in the .200-meter dash but
qualified for nationals. His time
of 20.55 was good enough to
break the school record.
Sophomore Eric Cannon’s time
of 14.01 gave him a second-place
finish in the 110 high hurdles.
Pitt received three third-place
finishes, which included another
school record.
The 4 x 100 meter relay team of
Dave Price, George Ifill, Cannon
and McRae finished with a time

The countdown is now only
three days away. Three days un—

Marvin Hagler will step into the
ring against Sugar Ray Leonard.‘

At stake will be the World Box-
ing Council middleweight cham-
pionship. Hagler, the undisputed
middleweight champion until a
few weeks ago, was stripped of
his World Boxing Association
belt because of the upcoming
fight with Leonard.'The WBA

‘The decisiongis just-one of the

fight. L'eonards"left eye is also a‘
concern. His left eye has been
surgically repaired for a detached
retina, an injury received while
training to defend his welter-

weight title against Roger Stafford

in the spring of 1982.

To . get clearance to fight,
Leonard had to be cleared by the
Nevada State Athletic Commi-
sion. Lloyd's of London agreed to
guarantee Leonard's eye after Dr.
Louis Angioletti said that the eye
was fine. '

Many have also expressed con-
cern that the only reason Leonard
is fighting is because he needs the
money. Leonard dismissed that

claim as nonsense. He earned be- -

Manager Davey Johnson's
band of bruisers, also known as

the New York Mets, are ready to _

start beating up other teams in the
National League East. ‘
It worked last year.

”We had to prove to ourselves

nobody could push us around,”
Darryl Strawberry said after a
bench-clearing incident with
Boston during A spring training.
”But we're not cocky.”

Oh, yes they are.

The Mets’ brand of confidence,

called arrogance by critics, is"
» punctuated by an endless stream

 

the ring during his career.
But this fight is more than just
another big event for Las Vegas.

The city is expecting the indirect '

impact of the fight to come close
to $300 million. That is including
hotels, casinos and, most impor-
tantly, gambling. The fight is be-
ing broadcast to approximately
1,000 closed-circut outlets. That

. is close to 1 million more seats

' sold for the event.
Besides being profitable for Las
Vegas, this is the biggest purse for
Hagler and Leonard. Hagler will

receive $12 million outright, _

while Leonard will receive $11
million. They both will receive a
share of the gate receipts, which

will add closeto anadditional $2 A

million foreach fighter.

The comeback for Leonard, af-
ter only one fight since 1982,
raises more questions about
Leonard's ability to win. Leonard
suffered his only knockdown in
his last fight in 1984. That was
against journeyman Kevin
Howard. Leonard came back
strong in that fight to register a
ninth-round knockout. That fight
wasistill very disappointing for
Leonard. He did not feel that he
could get up for that fight. After-
wards, he announced his
retirement.

A retirement from Leonard
should not be taken too serious-
.ly, since he haskdone it three
times in his career. He retired af-
ter he won the gold medal in the
1976 Olympics, after suffering
the detached retina in 1982, af-
ter he retired and after the fight
with Howard.

of home-run curtain calls and
high-fives. So many that the Mets
often revel while watching them-
selves in videos that blare from
the SheaStadium loudspeakers in
between innings.

But, give the World Series
champions credit. They took over

first place on April 23, won 108 '

games and finished 21 games
ahead of Philad.elphia,'the biggest
bulge since divisional play start-
ed in 1969.

If any World Series winner can
break the repeat jinx that has
prevailed since the New York

Yankees won in 1972-78, the

Mets‘ can. 4 _ -

of 40.35.

The mile relay team of Rowan
Mighty, Dave Moore, Price and
Manes crossed the line in 3209.8.
Senior Bob Weiner finished the
1500-meter run with a time of
3:48.88. .

All of the runners mentioned
qualified for the |C4A meet later
this spring.

”We did [really] well. It was a
good weekend,” said P_itt men's
track coach John Vasvary. ”To
have that many first, second and
third places are good.”

Some members of the team are
feeling as confident as their coach
and are looking for great things
this spring, due in part to their
sixth-place national ranking for
indoor track.

’’I feel the team will do well.
We were impressive indoor for
qualifyingsix people and coming
in sixth [as a team],” said Moore.
”Outdoor, we can have a couple
more people qualifying [for na-
tionals].”

’’I think we have just as good
a shot to win the outdoor cham-

pionship as we did indoors,” said 3

Manes. ”We should be pretty
strong. The places we were
strong indoors will be the same
outdoors.”

”This year we're a lot deeper,”
said Weiner. ”We're improved in
the middle and long distances,
the 1,500-meters. We have a few
freshmen running a lot better.”

is a big plus for the team, but

them an added boost they

Leonard does feel that he will
be mentally prepared for this
fight. ”A guy like Marvin Hagler
will bring out the best in me,”
said Leonard. Leonard, 30, was

‘approaching his prime when he

began his string of retirements
and comebacks. It is with this in
mind that on can rule out "ring
rust” as a deciding factor in de-
termining the winner of this fight.
Hagler, listed at 32 years old,
although some reports have him
being as old as 36, has only
fought twice since 1985.

The biggest motivation for Ha-
gler entering this fight will be that
he can finally convince himself

"that he is one of. the gr_eatest A

middleweights of all time. He is
already listed with the likes of
Jake LaMotta and Carlos Mon-
zon, who holds the record for ti-
tle defenses. Hagler is closing in
on that record, though. He has 12
title defenses compared to 14 for
Monzon.

The one comparison that will
always haunt Hagler is the one to
Sugar Ray Robinson. Robinson
finished his career 174 wins, 19
losses and six draws with 109
knockouts. Hag|er’s record of
62-2-2 pales when compared to
Robinson. — _

Duringfhis retirement, Leonard

tator for HBO. This put him at

pressure tookover.

for the past few. years. After each '
fight Hagler would bait Leonard’
for a fight between the two.
Leonard told his broadcast part-
ners that he knew how to beat
Hagler. He told his wife that he
could beat Hagler, while all the
time pondering whether or not he
should make another comeback.
Some feel that the deciding fac-
tor-was the Robert Duran fight in
late 1983. Duran, a bloated light-
weight, took Hagler 15 rounds in
the only title defense where Ha-
gler went the distance. Duran
"used good lateral movement to
outbox Hagler for the first six
rounds, until Hagler’s relentless

;

The common opponents for

Leonard and Hagler have fought
the two middleweights very
differently. When Leonard fought
Duran the first time in 1980, he
chose to slug toe—to—toe with him.
’’I fought a dumb. fight,” said
Leonard. He lasted 15 rounds.
Later in 1980, the rematch took
place, and Leonard chose to go
with his strengths. He boxed in-
stead of slugging with him. This
resulted in an infamous knockout
in eight rounds. ’’I left‘ him em-
barrassed and confused. Even his
sneer was gone,” said Leonard.

_Meanwhi|e, Duran stretched
Hagler to his limits in their title
bout. Hagler was disappointing,
and many felt that he was

slipping.

Thoughts of Hagler slipping
were quickly dispelled when he
met up with Thomas Hearns in
April of 1985. In what wasthe
most action-packed title fight
ever, Hagler was badly cut in the
first round during their slugfest.
Hagler had to turn.-it on, and he
took Hearns out in the third
round.

When Leonard fought Hearns
in 1981, he was being outboxed
and outpointed. In the 13th
round, Leonard had to go for the
knockout. He knocked Hearns
down and ended thefight in the
14th round. »

As for the upcoming»t'itle"bout,
the key for Leonard is not to get
into a brawl with Hagler. Eddie
Futch, who trained the last man
to beat Hagler —_Willie Monroe
—- said, ”The‘key to beating Ha-
gler is to keep him on the end of
a "left hand.”

Leonard has to keep Hagler
honest —he can rack up points
and win the round. Leonard
should also try his best to sting
him with the left jab; this will
cause Hagler to cut. Every time
Hagler gets hit in the eyes, he gets
puffy, and his eyes close or cut
and bleed dramatically.

Angelo Dundee, Leonard's
trainer, feels that Hagler is not the
same fighter he was five years
ago. ”He is not as fast,” said
Dundee;

Hagler will not be able to
knock out Leonard with one_
punch — he is a combination

. puncher.,Hagler wears you down

and then finishes you off.
Leonard will have to box Hagler
the same way he boxed Duran:
move in and out to frustrate him,
make him miss.

Hagler will have to cut the ring
off for Leonard and not let him
move around as much as he
would like to. Hagler will also
have to use constant pressure as
he did for the Hearns fight. Ha-
gler may want to do a lot of
switching back and forth from his
natural southpaw style to the con-
ventional right—handed attack. He
can do this in an attempt to con-
fuse Leonard.

Welterweight sensation Mark
Breland had this to say about the
fight when he picked Leonard to
win: ”Marvin stood up to some
big punches from [John] Mugabi,
but the idea is notto gethit.”

Leonard may already have the

, advantage in the fight — he is

making Hagler anxious. Hagler
quit the 12-city promotional tour
after six dates. He may also be
making Hagler afraid to lose.

This writer is picking Leonard
to,win the fight by a decision. He
will outbox Hagler and confuse
him. Leonard said, ”My biggest
motivation is that people don't
think that I can win.”

Leonard has been in this situa-
tion before, as not too many peo-
ple felt that he could beat Duran
or Hearns. But he proved his crit-
ics wrong. The greatness that was

Leonard will come out for this"

fight.

Jack Shuten has brought a lot of
prestige to the Pitt diving pro-
gram, qualifying for the NCAA
Championships three years in a
row, as well as being named the
most valuable diver at the Big
East Championships in February.

He has a shot at making All-
America honors this week as he
is participating in the NCAA Div-
ing Championships in Austin,
Texas. The championships began
yesterday and run through Satur-'
day. At press time, Shuten's
standings weren't known.

Shuten has literally ”lived, eat-
en and breathed diving” for the
past four years at Pitt. His only
regret is that diving couldn't be
his sole focus.

”My biggest complaint with
this university is that they did not
provide me with an ample schol-
arship," saidshuten. ”I wish I
didn't have to work over 30
hours a week in order to earn a
degree and dive for this universi-
ty. I'm very happy with what I
have accomplished. I know [that]
I could have accomplished more
if I had been afforded theluxury

of a scholarship.”

However, Shuten did not let his
financial problems stand in his
way. He captured first-place fin-
ishes in meets against Kenyon,
Cleveland, Villanova, St. Bon-
neventure, West Virginia and
Marshall.

Still, he is relatively low-key,
maintaining that awards do not
matter that much to him.

”Having a roomful of awards is
not that important to me,” said
Shuten. ”I win‘/so [that] I won’_t
get mad at myself because I am
the worst loser in the world.”

Being a top-ranked diver means
having to cope with a lot of pres-
sure and always mantaining a
competetive edge.

Diving is a dangerous sport that
challenges its participants to push
themselves to their limits, which
require This requires a great deal
of self-confidence. ”Diving is a
real mind game,” said Shuten.
”You have to have a lot of confi-
dence. If I say ’I can do it,’ I
won't. I have to say, ’I will do it.’
It takes a little bit of a cocky atti-
tude. You have to go into it with
the idea that I can hit this dive.
You go out there, dive and let the
judges score it.”

”We’ll get more points in the
field with Tim [Kulig],” added
Manes. ”We’ll pick up points we
couldn't get indoors.”

Vasvary agrees with Manes on
the importance of Kulig.

”We have one of the top jave-
lin throwers in the country in Tim
Kulig,” he said.

As for the rest of the team, Vas-
vary sees a strong team becom-
ing even better.

Holmes qualified as well. We are

Vasvary.

To sum up the potential
strength the team will have this
season, Manes, said: ”This is

probably the strongest track team’ I

Pitt has had in a long time.”

The Panthers will host a meet at

Shuten chose to attend the
University of Pittsburgh because
it was a Division I school with a
strong diving tradition. Another
factor in his decision to attend Pitt
was head diving coach Julian
Krug, who is one of the better
coaches in the nation.

”Julian doesn't recruit good
divers, he creates them,” said
Shuten. ”His coaching capabililty

is phenomenal. His style of

coaching is really unique. Julian

holds open practices. He doesn't

require any of us to attend. If you
don't want to be there, you don't
have to be. This type of practice
forces us to motivate and push
ourselves.” .

Most of the competition the
Panther diving team experiences
is from within the team. The Pitt

diving team is one of the strong-

est in the East. They are rarely
separated in dual meet competi-
tion. Shuten states one reason
why the team is so successful.
”We’re all crazy!," said Shuten.
”People don't like to" dive against
us because we're. tough. We've

- been known to dive so hard that

wewend up breaking a board.
’fOur team is very close knit,”
continued Shuten. ”Chris Blair

has been the biggest influence on
me here at Pitt. He has pushed
me a lot this year in the weight
room, in practice and in compe-
tition. I was very disappointed
when he did notqualify for the
NCAA Championships."
Shuten said that his goal going
into the NCAA Diving Champi-
onships was to dive well enough
to achieve All-America standing.
When Shuten returns from
Texas, he will compete in the
Senior National Finals meet the
following week. After that, Shut-

do.

Wilson (15 HR, 84 RBI) and
Samuel (16 HR, 78 RBI, 42 sto-
len bases) can hit. So can Mike
Easler, acquired from the New
York Yankees for Charles Hud-
son. The Phillies hope former DH
Easler can get more balls in left
field than get him.

Most likely, there will be a lot
of balls flying toward Philadel-
phia’s outfield. The Phillies
ranked seventh in the league and
even invited former ace‘ Steve
Carlton’ to camp in hopes he
could help. He couldn't.

Shane Rawley (11-7) is return-
ing from surgery. Bruce Ruffin did
well as a rookie (9-4), and Don

hitter) from the Chicago White
Sox for Gary Redus. Steve Bedro-
sian_ had 29 saves.

0 St. Louis Cardinals -

The Cardinals, who bragged in

1985 that ”speed never slumps,”
found out last season that you still
can't steal first base.

Willie McGee, Tommy Herr,
Vince Coleman and Jack Clark all
struggled as St. Louis atrophied to
79-82. McGee, the 1985 NL
MVP with a .353 average and 56
stolen bases, faded to .256 with
19 steals. Herr declined from
.302 and 110 RBI to .252 with 61
RBI, Coleman dipped from .267
to .232, and Clark was injured for
more than half the season.

John Tudor (21-8, 1.93 ERA).

pitched well (13-7, 2.92) without
much run support. Danny Cox
(12-13) was inconsistent. Rookie
Joe Magrane, 6-6, may make the
lefty-dominated rotation. For
relief, Todd Worrell (36 saves,
2.08) was NL Rookie of the Year,
but Jeff Lahti, part of St. Louis’
bullpen-by-committee in 1985,
has not recovered from arm
problems that limited him to four
appearances.

The Cardinals plugged their
biggest hole by getting Pena

(.288, 10 HR, 52 RBI) from Pitts-
burgh for Andy Van Slyke and
Mike LaVaIliere.

0 Montreal Expos

The Expos, formerly the team
of the ’80s,- were exactly that last
season. They lost 83 games and
could be a lot worse this year.

Andre. -Dawson‘ and Jeff‘ Rear-
don are gone, and Tim Raines
says he's not coming back."

The pitching staff-is wide open.
Injuries .rr”lay'keep ‘Bryn Smith,
Charlie Lea and.Joe Hesketh out
of action. Floyd Youmans (13-12)
and Neal Heaton (7-15), acquired
from Minnesota for Reardon, are
the only two sure starters. Tim

Burke (9-7) hopes to make up

some of Reardon’s 35 saves.
‘Montreal won't be able to
replace free agents Dawson
(.284, 20 -' HR, 78 RBI), who
signed with the Cubs, and Raines
(.332, 70 stolen bases), who is
unsigned and said he would not

go back, a stance he has since

softened.

.- Shortstop Hubie Brooks (.340,
14 HR,_58 RBI before being in-
jured halfway through 1986) and
third baseman Tim Wallach (18

  
       
       
   
   
       
   

. experience.

HR, 71 RBI) form the hardest-
hitting left side of the infield in
baseball.

Another bright spot — the
retractable roof over Olympic
Stadium is almost ready. One rea-
son for the dome was to block
out frigid weather in case the Ex-
pos reached the World Series —
using that reasoning, Montreal
could have waited another
decade.

0 Pittsburgh Pirates

The Pirates, under enthusiastic

‘new manager Jim Leyland, pro-

fessed to have a new attitude last

spring, compiling the best record -

in the Grapefruit League. But it
was return to reality once the sea-
son started, and Pittsburgh went
64-98, the worst in the majors.

The Pirates are younger but not
necessarily better.

Ace Rick Rhoden (15-12, 2.84)
was traded to the Yankees for Bri-
an Fisher, Doug Drabek and Lo-
gan Easley, a trio of young
pitchers for a patchwork pitching
staff anchored , by soon-to-be
38-year-old Rick Reuschel (9-16).

Johnny Ray (.301), Tony Pena

(.288), Jim Morrison (23 HR, 88'

RBI) and Barry Bonds (16 HR, 36

Slyke (.270, 13 HR, 61 RBI) and
John Cangelosi (50 SB for the
Chicago White Sox) will join
Bonds in the outfield.

0 Chicago Cubs

Chicago, the NL East"champi-
on in 1984, has added Dawson

lineup since then. But the Cubs
have died_.,._ . .. .. 

and Scott Sanderson (9-11), the
starting rotation in 1_984, all
signed big-money, multi—year
contracts after the division-
winning season! and then
flopped.

Age caught the Cubs. Ron Cey

-was traded; Chicago wants to

deal Gary Matthews (21 HR).

Ryne Sandberg (.284, 14 HR,
76 RBI, 34 SB) and Dunston (17
HR, 68 RBI) are Solid.

The Cubs think an injection of
youth, including pitchers Jarflie
Moyer, Drew Hall and Greg
Maddux and outfielders Rafael
Palmeiro, Dave Martinez and
Chico Walker, will help. Maybe,
but not for years.
