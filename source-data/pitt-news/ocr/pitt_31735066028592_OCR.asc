_S__peaker addresses Middle East's problems

By Cesca Antonelli
Staff Writer

As a former journalist and foreign cor-
respondent in Iran, the speaker at the
Twelfth Annual Peace Links dinner pre-
sented the problems of the Middle East
through a woman’s perspective Sunday
night in the William Pitt Union Ballroom.

Robin Wright said that, contrary to
popular belief, discrimination against
women is not one of the Middle East’s
major problems.

“I was often surprised,” Wright said.
“There are more women in Iran’s
Parliament than there are in the U.S.
Senate. Things often aren’t what they
seem to be. The basic problems in the
Middle East are no differentifor men and
women.” '

Peace Links is an organization con-
ceived by women that strives to prevent
nuclear and conventional war by promot-
ing ‘international understanding. The
organizers believe that, through education

and participation, they can make a differ-
ence. -

Wright’s speech was dedicated to
showing the problems the Middle East
will face in the future, especially in light
of the recent assassination of Yitzhak
Rabin and the bombing in Saudi Arabia.

“The death of Yitzhak Rabin cannot be
underestimated,” Wright said. A

She hopes the timing of his death will
not prevent the ultimate goal of peace
from being attained. Since Rabin’s death,
support for peace has grown from 50 per-
cent to 74 percent. So far, three percent
of the land in the West Bank has been
turned over to the Palestinians. Sometime
next year, that number will grow to 27
percent.

“There are still doubts about peace.
There are 147,00 Israelis living in the
West Bank. Most are angry and scared,
even though most will remain under total
Israeli control,” Wright said.

Wright also cited future problems faced
by the peace process. The issue of sover-

Elton John ?

eignty will be pressed next March, and
the future of Jerusalem is still undecided.

“This is, by comparison, the easy part,”
Wright said.

Wright thinks that religious extremism
will elevate itself and future peace talks
to a whole new level, where traditional
mediators, like the United States, will no
longer be acceptable.

“The most energetic force in the
Middle East today is religious extrem-
ism,” she said. “The bottom line is theol-
ogy is replacing ideology.”

Over the next decade she expects reli-
gious extremism to present new chal-
lenges to peace that may get worse before
they get better.

“Extremists invoke God’s name as they
slaughter,” she said. Wright also
spoke of the tensions in the Middle East
that led up to recent events. The people
have experienced decades of repression
due to the eroding legitimacy of their
governments since the 1960s.

community and students

Imagine working 20 hours a day and enjoying it. This is the life of
Pitt Police officer and self-defense instructor Curtis Smith.
Everyday the 41-year-old is on the move, whether it be working his
beat on the police force, teaching his self-defense classes, teaching at
one of the police academies or any of his other numerous jobs.

Smith, who is a former football player at Pitt, said it is his love for
the sport that brought him here.

“It’s been a long time since my playing days during the Tony
Dorsett era here,” said Smith.

Smith grew up in and went to high school in Long Island, N.Y.,
and during these years he never lost a football game or a dual—meet

When Smith came to Pitt, his winning streak continued. He was a
three-year letter winner in football under coach Johnny Majors, and
he played on a team that was good enough to play in both the Sun
and Fiesta Bowls. He also wrestled and never lost a dual meet here

“The perseverance, the attitude, the win type of philosophy was
very apparent, and sometimes that is the ingredient that will get you
to the next level,” he said. “It helped me out in every sense.”

Class teaches students how to fight back

By -Russ Krebs
For the Pitt News

Shootings, robberies,
rapes, muggings, scams —
these are all problems that

unfortunately are part of‘

attending a school located
within a city.

What is the student to do
when confronted by these
problems? Transferring is
the first option. But if what
if you happen to like Pitt?
Carrying a gun or other
weapons is another option,
but that can be..more trouble
than it is worth.

Another option, which is
probably the best, is to take

a self-defense course.

Curtis Smith is an instruc-
tor at Pitt who teaches a
class he feels every student
should take during their
academic career. Smith’s
class is called “Buy
Yourself A Minute” or
BYAM, and that’s exactly
what this class is supposed
to do.

“It is designed solely for
the environment here and
for the students here,”
Smith said. “to make them
much more aware of their
surrounding area.”

Smith believes the course
is successful because he
designs it to meet the

demands of a changing soci-
ety.

“The criminal aspect and
makeup is always changing.
A couple of years ago there
wasn’t a lot of gang activity
around here or initiations,
but now there is.”

Smith is also a Pitt Police
officer and teaches classes
at several police academies.
His role as a police officer
keeps him constantly in
touch with the community.

“I just go to the street, and
the guys in the neighbor-
hoods tell me all the infor-
mation that I need to know,”
Smith said.

He does a lot of things in

and for the neighborhoods,
and the people that he
helped now are around to
help him. He feels that his
contacts are very important
in keeping his class worth-
while to the Pitt student.

Smith views his BYAM
class as not just an exercise
course, but as a course for
the mind as well. He says
that self-defense is more a
mental process than just a
physical one. In this class
you will learn how not to let
your psyche allow you to
become a victim.

There are three phases
taught in the class. The first

A Mid East  

 

X The Pitt News, Tuesday, November 21, 1995

°From page 1

Population growth rates have increased, while the
availability of jobs and housing have decreased.

She believes there are two main groups trying to
redefine the political structure of the Middle East.

The ﬁrst is the liberal movement of the Arab mid-
dle class. While the movement pushes for democra-
cy and human rights, it doesn’t necessarily want to
empower the masses. Many in the middle class are
nervous that it might endanger their own privileges.-

The second group is a larger religious movement

that is deeply rooted in society. Islam has wide-
spread appeal with many classes because it not only
gives rules for spirituality but also for governing.
Wright stresses that Islam is also widely divided
along a spectrum ranging from democracy to gov-
ernment by the elite upperclass.

“It means a lot of hard choices,” Wright said.

The people of the Middle East must weigh reforms
with the stability and inﬂuence they have now. And
so, Wright says, must the United States.

“Neglect undermines the U.S. interests and peace.

Defense

°From page 1
phase is the desensitization phase.
This teaches the student to be able
to strike another person. He puts a
big red suit on one of his instructors
and then teaches the student to be
able to strike. It’s one thing to say

that you are going to be able to‘

strike an attacker, but doing it is
quite different. Being considered a
master at several different martial

 ._arts makes him quite able to teach

{this effectively.

The second phase is being able to
take a hit. ‘

“Without training, people tend to
panic when receiving an unexpected
blow,” he said.

Smith teaches both how to antici-
pate that blow and how to receive a
blow. People don’t leave his class
with broken bones, but they do
learn how to react if they should be

' attacked.

The third phase is the ability to
deal with verbal abuse. That verbal
abuse can come in the form of sexu-
al, racial or almost anything that
would get a person upset if said to
them. The BYAM method will teach
you to be able to handle this abuse

5 and what to do when it occurs.

Smith also teaches the student to

get into the criminal’s mind. He
teaches the student how a criminal
thinks and acts and how to use that
to your advantage. When you know
what to expect, not becoming a VlC-
tim becomes a great deal easier.

The most important part of the
entire class according to Smith is
that he incorporates live assimila-
tion into it.

“Training cannot be complete
without being able to hit someone
or walk through the streets and sur-
vive a mock attack,” Smith said.

At the end of the BYAM class, the
students walk through the streets of
Oakland, and someone attempts to
attack them. The students are
unaware of when or where this is
going to occur, so it is just like real
life. A

Smith hopes the class will teach
the students how to become street-
wise, to recognize criminal behav-
ior before becoming a victim and to
defend themselves if attacked.

“We don’t live in the perfect soci-
ety where nobody gets attacked or
hurt,” he said. “This class most
importantly dispels the attitude that
‘this could never happen to me.’

‘Instead, it instills the attitude that

9'!’

‘yes, this could happen to me.

said.

No peace can endure without fundamental political
reform. It is only democracies that do not go to war
with each other,” Wright said.

She believes that the United States must realize
that peace and reforms in the Middle East are more
important than securing their own material wants
and fields of influence in that region. She stresses
the long-term consequences if no action is taken.

But Wright also remains optimistic.

“There will be a comprehensive peace,” Wright

Smith

°From page 1

In 1976, Smith graduated from Pitt
with a degree in the social sciences.
When asked why he chose to stay in
Pittsburgh, he said, “Pittsburgh was a
quite unique place. It wasn’t too fast,
but it wasn’t too slow; it was right in the
middle. The people here are fantastic. It
is very conducive for living and meet-

ing people -— kind of like a small-town-

atmosphere within a big city.”

After graduation, Smith devoted most
of his energies to the martial arts. He
achieved a master level ranking in Ju-
Jitsu, Shotokan, Kwanmuzendokai
Karate and the Hong Kong Athletic
Association Global Martial Arts. Master
level in the martial arts is far above any
degree of black belt.

Smith has competed in many martial
-arts competitions. On top of adding
more than 400 trophies from these com-
petitions to his collection, in 1977 he
was named competitor of the year by
the Kwarn Mu Kwarn Federation.

Because of all of Smith’s awards and
trophies, he is part of the World’s
Martial Arts Hall of Fame directory and
was recently inducted into it. The
Who’s Who in Karate lists him as one
of its members as well.

Smith decided to go to the Allegheny
County Police Academy four years after

graduating from Pitt. He is a state-certi-
fied police officer and is certified to
teach several different police courses.
Among those are weapons tactics and
chemical tactics. He now works on the
Pitt Police force and teaches at two
police academies as well as teaching at
Pitt and Carnegie Mellon.

In his free time, Smith instructs peo-

ple who work in hospitals how to han- .

dle people who come in on drugs or

with other mental or physical problems.
“I can go into hospitals and teach pas-

sive restraint,” he said. “I used to work

in hospitals and learned it from other q

experts.”

Smith has also written a book called
“The BYAM Method of Self-Defense,”
which he uses in his class.

Recently, Smith was appointed as a
special commissioner by Mayor
Murphy and has protected people as
important as Saudi Arabian sheiks and
movie stars.

When asked if he thought there was
one thing that he could tell the students
to help them protect themselves better,
he said no.

“Without both mental and physical
training, we can all become victims,”
Smith said. “Even with the training, you
still must keep in practice all the time,
or you will lose it.”

Study focuses on students‘ racial, social concerns

Many deﬁnitions and interpretations of
diversity exist. However, before one can
interpret and deﬁne, perceptions of rele-
vant issues should be considered. To
assess how undergraduate students at the
University of Pittsburgh’s main campus
perceive the racial, academic and social
climate, a study which was a replication of
my dissertation was conducted earlier this
year. Dr. Nancy Washington, Leon Haley
and Chenitis Pettigrew of the Chancellor’s
Diversity Working Group supported the
study that was conducted by the
University Center for Social and Urban

. Research (UCSUR).

A sample of 1000 African-American
and 1000 white undergraduate students
was randomly drawn from a complete list-
ing of all African-American and white
undergraduates at the university by the
Ofﬁce of Institutional Research and sup-
plied to UCSUR. Data were gathered
from a survey and focus groups to deter-
mine student perceptions. Results indicate
that, overall, African-American students
had more negative perceptions of the carn-
pus climate.

Some main conclusions are:

Institutional Attractiveness

1. White students indicated that ethnic
studies; recruitment/admission programs;
diverse faculty, students and staff; and
social/cultural life are not as important to

them as they are to African-American stu-_

dents.

2. African-American students do not feel
that the campus environment is sensitive
to their needs or that campus police treat

all students equitably.

3. Both groups stressed the importance of
more opportunities to interact with faculty
and the need for increased ﬁnancial aid.

Racial Climate

4. African American students tended to
lean towards describing the racial climate
as socially separated, insensitive and indif-
ferent, while white students were neutral

dents indicated the need for a diverse cur-
riculum. Both groups stressed the need for
more mentoring opportunities for students.

Faculty and Classroom Behavior

8. Both groups felt that faculty called on
all students in the classroom setting.
However, African American students indi-
cated faculty tend not to go indepth on
topics that are pertinent to them.

environment, while African-American stu-

important to the creation of a campus
environment conducive to increased grad-
uation rates. However, African-American
students overwhelmingly indicated they
experienced feelings of alienation and that
African-American faculty, orientation and
racism had an impact on their perceptions
of the campus climate as being either hos-
pitable or inhospitable.

Students provided institutional, personal
and programmatic recommendations. The
institutional suggestions included improv-
ing advising, orientation, counseling, and
ﬁnancial aid; diversifying the curriculum,
faculty, and student body; and providing
more interaction between faculty and stu-

dents. Personal recommendations were
that students should work harder, develop
support groups and socialize less.
Programmatic issues mentioned were the
increase of cultural functions, the imple-
mentation of an attendance policy and the
invitation of more African American
speakers to campus.

At the University of Pittsburgh. the
graduation rates for African-American stu-
dents is 39.6 percent, compared to 65.3
percent forvwhite students. Education
experts are now investigating the possibili-
ty of noncognitive variables that are pre-
sent in a campus environment such as pro-
fessors’ attitudes, the absence of cultural
activities and racism as possible reasons
why the disparities exist.

In the business world, (and education is
business), diversification is absolutely
essential to a company’s existence.
Companies have several options in an
ever-changing political and technological
era. They can merely exist; they can phase
out because they cannot remain competi-
tive; or they can experience growth and
expansion because they considered the
needs of their clientele. Consequently, the
degree to which the administration can
ameliorate some of the administrative and
programmatic concerns put forth by the
students, could possibly determine how
diversity can be actualized and graduation
rates can be inﬂuenced positively. If not.
it’s inevitable that we will continue to wit-
ness what Andrew Hacker calls “Two
Nations” existing on one campus.

at the Graduate School of Public
Health)

  Opinions

‘ I I . I V  ‘)
Is it news wor y .

If you watch between 5 and  tonight on channel 546 you
could win $l0.000!!!!!!! Yippee! Turn on the set, settle down
for a bit and numb your brain. It’s time for Wheel of Torture.

At least that’s what this joke should be called, although the
powers-that-be in the broadcasting world still insist on calling
this hour of programming the “evening news.” Since when did
the evening news become a game show? We can hear this con-
versation right now running through board rooms at the local
channels: “That’s it, no one is watching, so we’ll bribe viewers
to watch with the remote possibility of winning money.”

The one thing broadcasting gurus forgot about was that,
despite the enticing prospect of winning a few thousand dollars,
the local news programs are pathetic wastes of air time. There is
very little worth watching on the local news, except for the
weather report, and even that is not usually right.

Does anyone remember when thenews had substance? The
only thing ever shown on local news is who was shot in
Homewood, who was evading property taxes in Baldwin, who
escaped from a car accident without injury and who didn’t get
out, and how many germs are on handrails in malls (“investiga-
tive reporting”). Anything that ever happened in the entire world
in an entire day is crammed into a tiny little “World in a
Minute” segment, which you will miss if you blink. God forbid
if something major ever happens, we will never know anything
more than that some guy in Peru shot some other guy who might
have been important.

“Family sensitive news” is another interesting phenomenon.
Someone got the idea that some news should not be viewed by
children. So instead of reporting on the same stories and leaving
out the graphics, we have to listen to some anchor ramble about
the bake sale held in Carrick. Please, spare us the important

’ details.

If you have ever seen a “news”cast in which someone’s name
wasn’t botched, someone wasn’t misquoted, a picture wasn’t
shown with the wrong script or some other stupid mistake
wasn’t made, consider yourself lucky.

The point is, local news isn’t even worth watching anymore.
Instead of offering rewards for people who do tune in, how

\ about one of these options: hire anchors who can read, cover
real news stories and get the real facts when a story is covered.
A novel idea, we know, but try it. It might work.

Happy Turkey Day!

Thursday is a day when we can sit down to a gigantic meal
and gorge ourselves on anything and everything. And no
Thanksgiving dinner would be complete without the 49-pound
turkey gracing the center of the table, with plenty of leftovers to
tide us all over for the next two months. You might even try a
yam, though no one is really sure what they are or where they
come from.

Enjoy your Thanksgiving, whether it includes Viking-style
gorging on a Turkey drumstick or jello molds in the shape of a
turkey. Whatever your personal tradition — football games Al
Bundy-style or quiet family unity —— have a great holiday!

Vox headlines stir up
all kinds of S**t

I feel that I am a part of the
University of Pittsburgh. I am
involved in campus life and
student activities to a large
extent. However, when I saw
the cover of The Vox on Nov.
16, I was ashamed to be asso-
ciated with this university.

Being an English writing
major, I understand the cultur-
al emphasis and pseudo-
strength that a four-letter word
can add to an argument, but I
see no place for obscenities on
the front page of the widely-
distributed Vox/Pitt News

The Vox has been employing
shock value shamelessly in
the past few weeks. I find this
very unprofessional. The last
issue caught our eye by burn-
ing the nation’s ﬂag on the
cover, and this past week it
grabbed our attention by
exploiting our freedom of the
press and insulting the intelli-
gence of Pitt students.

From my standpoint, no
one’s impressed. If anything, I
am disheartened by the lack of
respect and discretion exhibit-
ed by the writers of The Vox.
Our newspaper represents the
students of the University of
Pittsburgh. I would ask them
to represent me positively.

In writing this opinion, I
have no intention of trying rob
the editors of their First
Amendment rights. I merely
would like them to respect my
own. -

The saga continues

As a member of Greek life,
I would like to take this
opportunity to sincerely apol-
ogize to all Greeks and inde-
pendents (especially female)
who read the insolent, disgust-
ing remarks of ‘Ferris J.
Anderson II of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. I was appalled by the

words I read and was humili-
ated by the fact that this
cretin’s letter was published in
defense of the Greek system.
Mr. Anderson’s attacks on Ms.
Kendra and women as a whole
were deplorable and down-
right inappropriate. They not
only succeeded in angering
the women on this campus,
but also succeeded in provid-
ing an even greater spark by
which the critics of the Greek
system can build their flame.
Though Ms. Kendra’s opinion
indeed deemed a response in
defense of Greek life on Pitt’s
campus, Mr. Anderson’s letter
only served.to dig us a deeper
hole from which we Greeks
will now have to escape.
Thank you, Mr. Anderson, for
your “help” in making our
image even more justifiable of
criticism. That was exactly
what Ms. Kendra wanted.
Jennifer J. McCoy

As is often the case, the vic-
tims have been forgotten. The
real issue in the recent Towers
incident should not center
around being Greek or inde-
pendent. The real issue is that
rights were violated. The
women victimized in this inci-
dent have been robbed of their
rights of privacy, dignity and
safety —— safety that should be
unquestionable in what is sup-
posed to be their home.

To imply that this kind of
violation is simply some kind
of.“human” mistake is absurd.

"Where does Mr. Beauregard

propose we drawthe prover-
bial line? Should we also
excuse assault and rape by
merely chalking them up to
human error?

Mr. Anderson’s references
to the female genitalia were
both inappropriate and non-
sensical — and yet he is will-
ing to accept some kind of
challenge for an “intellectual
battle.” Perhaps he should
first prepare himself by leam-
ing the value of respect. His
comments only reinforce the

lack of respect for women
already displayed on this cam-
pus.

Greek or non-Greek, the
males involved in this inci-
dent should be punished to the
fullest extent, and the victims
should be cared for in the best
way possible. That is the bot-
tom line. Let’s not cloud the
issue at hand with petty argu-
ments.

Quaterback dancers

I was rather bemused by at
article printed a while back by
Ed Ziegenfuss concerning the
role of today’s quarterback in
football. I wasn’t sure just
what message the author was
trying to convey.

The burning question was
“are quarterbacks real football
players, or should they be
wearing skirts and heels on
the field?” Is the author say-
ing the quarterbacks are trans-
vestites? Perhaps he thinks
quarterbacks would look
attractive in skirts and heels.
The thought did cross my
mind that maybe Ed was try-
ing to compare these quarter-
backs to women. He labeled
the quarterbacks as being
weak, cop-outs and cry
babies.

However, since being a\

woman is not synonymous
with these undesirable traits,
to make such a comparison
would be not only ludicrous,
but illogical. The author also
mentioned an illegal hit on a
quarterback that sent him
“flying like the ballerina he
probably is.” Considering that
ballerinas possess great
strength, ﬂexibility, grace and
power, I’m sure any quarter-
back would be honored to
receive such praise. I bet Dan
Marino would agree with me
on this one.

Black Friday, you’ll

probably be looking for some-

big Calc exam are out of the pic-

You could get a jump on your

hang out with your family  or
perhaps take in some great Big
East football action. Sounds
funny, huh? e

We’ ve reached the end of what
has been a disappointing season
for J ohrmy Majors and the
Panthers. Recently, players have
openly criticized Majors’ criti-
cism of them. Looks like we’ve
got a soap opera on our hands. .
Luckily for everyone, especially
the coaches and players, this
soap opera is about to (come to a
ﬁzzlingrend.

The less-than-chilling ﬁnal
episode will air this Friday when
Pitt travels to Morgantown for
the ‘95 backyard brawl for a 4:05
p.m. start. This game will be per-
formed in front of a live studio
audience only, but it will be on
ESPN radio.

Remember back to late
August when both of these teams
were looking at this game as the
last test before a trip to some-
where sunny and warm for a
bowl.

Things sure have changed
since then.

The Panthers come into the
game with a 2-8 record overall
and are winless in the Big East
so far in ‘95. Don Nehlen’s
Mountaineers enter Friday’s
game with a 4-6 mark West
V1rginia’s 3-3 in the conference
with wins over Temple (24-13),
Boston College (31-19) and
Rutgers (59-26).

The Panthers last played Nov.
11, when the Orangemen came
into town and beat the wind, rain
and the Panthers. Syracuse
rocked Pitt 42- 10 for the
Panther’s' eighth straight loss.

' West Virginia traveled to the
Orange Bowl to face the
Hunicanes last week and did
nothing but brighten Miami's
bowl hopes with a 17-12 loss.

Swimming spliisweekeml races

By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

Last weekend at Ohio State, the men’s
and women’s swim teams bettered their
records to 5- 1.

The men beat Virginia 68-45 and lost to
Ohio State 50-62. The women lost to
Virginia 54-59 and beat Ohio State 72-38.

For the men it was the closest loss to Ohio
State ever. '

‘The meet last weekend was indicative of
our vast improvement as a team over the
past six years,” coach Chuck Knoles. “We
are now a very highly competitive Division
I swim team that can walk into any confer-
ence in the nation and swim heads up with
any other team in the nation.”

The meet came down to the ﬁnal event,
the 400-yard medley relay, and Pitt lost by a
second. If it would have won this meet, it
would have been one of the “biggest wins
ever,” said Knoles.

Pitt started off the meet with a sweep in
the 50 free with Steve Lewter (21.48), Eric
Stull (-2l.86)’and Bob Nooning (21.97). In
the 100 free Eric Stefanski placed second
(46.57), and Eric Stull placed third (47.69).
Stefanski placed second again in the 200
free (1241.25), and senior captain Sami
Vartiainen ﬁnished third (l:42.42). The only
scoring in the 500-yard freestyle was by
freshman Preston Hamontree, who came in
third.

The only scoring in the backstroke events
was done by Adam Kotkiewicz in the 200
when he finished third. In the 200.breast-
stroke, Pitt took ﬁrst and third with Chris
Perry (2208.83) and senior captain Tony
Sunseri (2: 12.95) ﬁnishing respectively.

“Chris Perry’s swim was one of the most
exciting swims I’ve ever seen, because he

Jill Fletcher swims the backstroke.

had to win to keep us in the meet for the
relay, and he came through with experi-
ence,” said Vartianen.

Jon Haggerty and Mike Tortorici placed
second and third in the 200 ﬂy with times of
1:53.69 and 1:55.04.

The loss was “disappointing” because
they came so close, said Vartianen.

“A couple of years ago, we weren’t on the
same level as OSU, but now we are. We can
walk out of OSU with our chests held high

and our chins up, because we competed
really well,” said Knoles.

The women’s team beat Ohio State for the
first time in eight years.

“We beat OSU handedly, and we came up
a little short against Virginia, losing by ﬁve
points,” said head coach Marian Cassidy
Keen. “This meet says a lot about our team
this year. They’ve come a long, long way.
They are working really hard at this point in

Track holds Blue and Gold meet

By Joseph Kielec
For The Pitt News

Saturday, the Pitt men’s and
women’s track and ﬁeld teams
concluded one of their most suc-
cessful Blue and Gold
intrasquad meets in years.

Both teams were close
throughout the entire meet, and
after three days of intense com-
petition, the meet came down to
the women’s 4 x 800,‘ in which
the Blue team ran away from the
Gold team to set a meet record
and lead the team to a 114-111
victory.

The record-setting relay team
pulled ahead in the second leg of
the race due to sophomore Arma
Kohler’s gutsy running after tak-
ing the baton from senior
Natasha Van Reil. From that
point on sophomore Stacey
Anderson and freshman Tamika
Dorin finished up the last two
legs of the relay.

The record was the group’s‘

second for the day; earlier it set
a new mark in the distance med-
ley relay. In all, six new records
were set in the meet.

The teams were divided up by
captains, who then selected the
rest of their squad in a draft. The
meet is more of an opportunity
to let the athletes get acclimated
to competing indoors and pre-
viewing the season than any-
thing else.

Coach Steve Lewis, in his

11th year as the women’s head
coach and in his second year as
men’s coach, was impressed
with what he saw in the meet.

“This is the best Blue—Gold
meet we’ve ever had. There
were several surprises, and sev-
eral meet records were broken,”
Lewis said.

He was particularly pleased
with his freshman class.

Kevin Thomas was one of
several freshman who had a
strong meet. He opened up with
a victory and a meet record in
the long jump with a leap of
22’7”. On Saturday he ran the
400 three times to go along with
an impressive run in the 50-yard
dash. Thomas was slow coming
out of the blocks in the 50, but
he retained his composure and
came back to take second
behind junior Jerel Williams.

“He came out and made a
statement today,” Lewis said of
Thomas, who didn’t start run-
ning track until his junior year of
high school.

Senior Tonya Mullins also had
several strong performances,
setting a meet record in the long
jump, taking ﬁrst in the 50-yard
dash and placing second in the
50-yard hurdles behind standout
Najurna Fletcher.

Mullins was also part of a
record-setting 4 x 400 team
which‘ included senior Gemrifer
Washington, junior Angie
Martin and multi-talented fresh-

man Trecia Smith, who set
another meet record in the shot
put with a throw of 44’2”. She
captured second in the high
jump to Fletcher as well.

Fletcher has already estab-
lished herself as one of the
greatest mnners in the history of
Pitt’s track program. Last year
she was the NCAA indoor
champion in the triple jump and
has racked up several other hon-
ors throughout her prestigious
track career.

“We’re going towin the Big
East,” predicted senior sprinter
Ayne Allen. “If everyone can
keep their heads together,
there’ll be nothing to worry
about.”

The Panthers plan to field a
strong distance crew this year
under assistant coach Dave
Sobol.

“We’ll be able to run very
competively in the East,” said
the coach, who is in his first year
at Pitt. Sobol was pleased with
how the distance runners pre-
formed on Saturday, particularly
freshman Julio Ortiz.

Lewis said that the members
of the team have a lot of experi-
ence and talent, and they should
be able to contest for. the Big
East Championship. He also is
confident that several team
members will be able to advance
to the NCAA championships
and compete for honors at that
level of competition.

While most people like to
go to sporting events to
watch and enjoy the game,
others like to go and become
part of the game.

It was nearing the end of
the third period in a 2-1
game when an audience
member made an antagonis-
tic comment to a player.

Disregarding the action on
the ice, the player left the ice
surface and headed into the
bleachers to take the fan up
on his invitation. .

“Hey, look at Billy,”
yelled one of Billy’s team-
mates. At that moment,
more players rushed off the
ice and into the bleachers
after him.

After being confronted by
the player, the fan stayed
seated and refused to back
up his comment. Moments
later, flaring tempers had
died down, and the alterca-
tion was disregarded
because nothing came of it.
The players returned to the
ice. and the fan remained

passed to Steve Fisher at the
blue line. Fisher passed over
to Brad Rizzo, who took a
long shot from the blue line.
The shot beat the CMU goalie
to the bottom right corner of
the net.

Within six minutes of the
second period, CMU regained
the lead. With 12:39 remain-
ing in the second period,
CMU got a quick goal to
make it a 2-1 hockey game.

Through the rest of the sec-
ond period, the goalies were
the ones who stole the spot-
light.

“Their goalie played well
also.”

Despite out-shooting CMU
30-l8, Pitt only managed one

“Billy had incredible shots
that this goalie just stopped,”
White said.

pulled Haduch so as to be only
one man down in the final
minutes of play.

With Haduch on the bench
and the extra man on the ice,
CMU scored into an empty
Panther net to seal the victory.

“It’s frustrating, because we
played a really good game, but
got called on too many penal-
ties,” White said.

Penalties seemed to make
the difference in the game. Pitt
was penalized 11 times com-
pared to CMU’s seven times.
But the seven times CMU was
penalized, Pitt already had a
man in the penalty box. So
there was no Pitt power play,
just four-on—four hockey.

“We were short-handed.

most of the game,’ coach
Rizzo said.

With the Panthers so short-
handed, their penalty killing
unit and Haduch were called
upon more than usual. Both
Haduch and the penalty killing
unit did their jobs and refused
CMU a power play goal.

“Don’t take stupid penal-
ties,” White said, referring to
the best advice for the team.
“We have to work on not
retaliating. They always get
the guy who retaliates.”

Although the Panthers lost,
they don’t feel outplayed.

“I think we outplayed and
outshot them; we just couldn’t
score,” coach Rizzo said. “It
was a good, solid game. We
just came out on the short
end.”

Pitt will travel up to

Meadville to play Allegheny

Column
°From page 5

The Panthers bring a hobbled running game into Morgantown.
Fullback Chris Patton (shoulder) is doubtful, and fellow fullback
Chris Schneider is nursing an ailing knee.

Pitt  have to ride the arm of redshirt frosh Matt Lytle. In his ﬁrst
start, Lytle looked good, going 20-38 for 200 yards and one score.

Last year’s episode was a cliffhanger, with the Mountaineers ﬁnally
winning 47-41 thanks to a 60-yard bomb with :15 seconds left. It
looked as if John Ryan and the Panthers had pulled off an amazing
Homecoming comeback after they went up 41-40 on a J ells TD. But
the toughluck Panthers couldn’t hold up and were served another loss.

There are some odd story twists that could play a factor Friday. For
instance, the visitor has won the last six meetings between the two
teams. Also, the Panthers have won their ﬁnal game the past two sea-
sons to ﬁnish 3-8 each time.

What do the directors have in store for this year’s episode, the 87th
between the two teams? You can throw the records out when these
two teams play, and I’m sure each team would just love that this year.

Will there be another surprise ending? We’ll have to wait and hear,
but I have had a little foreshadowing, and I’ve come up with my ver-
sion.

Matt Lytle picks apart the WVU secondary, but the Panther defense
continues its slide also. Chris Ferencik has a solid finale in pursuit of
the Lou Groza Award going to the nation’s best placekicker with ﬁve
ﬁeld goals. That’s the bright spot for the Panthers on the day.

West Virginia 34 — Pitt 22. The cliffhanger  I smell a quarter-
back controversy. Get ready Pistol Pete, because incoming freshman
QB Tony Zimmerman from Penn-Trafford or Lytle could have your
number.

First places were won by Melissa Burns in the 200 free (1:55.59)
and Samantha Chabotar in the 500—yard freestyle (5200.20), 1000 .
