Alter College
Association’s
Constitution

Make General Dance Ticket
Sale’Possible; to Award
Keys for Service

Reduce Dues To $2.00

Several revisions and amendments
were made in the constitution of the
College Association at a dinner meet-
ing of the cabinet at Webster Hall
Thursday evening. Among them were
changes of articles which have be-
come obsolete since the organization
was founded in 1926 and a provision
by which keys will be awarded for
service in the cabinet of the Associa-
tion.

One of the principal topics of dis-
cussion was the sale of tickets to
members of other schools not_ eligible
for membership in the organization.
After discussing the practicability of
two diﬁerent kinds of tickets, one for
members and one for non-members,
the group decided to provide on the
regular tickets a place for a check
designating the holder as a member
or a guest. In this way, while mem-
bership in the Association is limited
to the College, according to the con-
stitution, it will be possible for all
students in the University to support
the dances.

Former regulations also provided
that the membership fee should be
$2.50 per semester. Since the time at
which the ruling was made, conditions
have forced the organization to lower
the price to $2. This change was
formally made in the constitution.

The same article provided for the
distribution of funds of the organia-
tion into Social, Pitt-in-China and stu-
dent loan. This section was amended
to state that all receipts should be
kept in the social fund and quantities
be paid into the student loan and
other funds at various times during
the year whenever the transfer is
deemed advisable by the cabinet.

The revised constitution states also
that any student in the college is
eligible for election to ofﬁce in the
Association, membership in the organ-
ization not being necessary at the
time of the election.

To the by-laws was added a pro-
vision whereby keys can be awarded
to ofﬁcers who have served for one
year and those who have been mem-
bers of the cabinet for two, provided

' that they have attended three-fourths

of the meetings and discharged their
responsibilities with a reasonable
amount of efliciency. Ben Weissman,
Col. ’33, presented the plan for the
keys, as designed by Balfours, stated
that working for these awards would
encourage the much-needed interest
among the members of the cabinet.
In consideration of the fact that the
graduating seniors will not have an
opportunity to fulﬁll the requirements,
the group voted that all these should
receive keys.

Those who will receive keys are:
Robert Jarvis, Ben Weissman, Joseph
Novak, Jack Hunger, Darell Whitaker,
Thomas Cummings, William Theis,
Edna Landman, Barbara Hartman,
Lois Boggs, and Harry Borus,

It was recommended, in considera-
tion of a provision in the former con-
stitution, that during the coming year
the association should sponsor one
student assembly to which students,
particularly those in the college, should‘
be invited. Regular meetings of the
cabinet were also suggested as a
means of bettering the work of the
group.

Successful Sports Dance Friday
Closes Week of Spring Activities;
_'l‘_1_'_i-Deltas Capture Major Prizes

Pitt’s Satirical Paper
Appears At Friday
Night Affair

The socially and ﬁnancially success-
ful Sports Dance Friday night at the
Grotto Club brought to a ﬁnish a week
of extensive pre-Festival activities
which, though marred to a great ex-
tent by ad-verse weather conditions,
combined to account for a particu-
larly enjoyable week.

More than 600 couples danced to
the music of Burt Weidenhamer’s Oi‘-
chestra and Rosenb-erg’s Collegians.
Additional entertainment from the

Little Bohemia Club, distribution of

the satirical “Pitt Razz” sheet which
preceded by a special trailer
its content by
Louis L. Kaufman, Sun-Telegraph
Globe Trotter, the presentation of the
University spoon, and the awarding
of trophies won in the fraternity
events of the week were features of
the intermission period.

All Friday’s fraternity features
were run off in a, persistent downpour
which drenched spectators and par-
ticipants both, and which accounted
for slow times in all events.

The large bronze cup for ﬁrst place
in the pushmobile sweepstakes relay
for men’s fraternities was won by
Phi Gamma Delta; second place went
to Phi Delta Theta; and the third
cup was earned by Sigma Chi.

The Phi Delts won the ﬁrst heat
of the sweepstakes and the Phi
Gams and Sigma Chis were ﬁrst and
second respectively in the second

heat. The victors were decided on
time basis.

The winning time was 4 minutes, 22
seconds, which was: 14 seconds slow-
er than that of lastgyear. The cham-
pionship team was §composed of-Har-
old Conley, Walter? Good, Richard
Kimmel, Robert La Rue, and the
driver, Ross Thomas.

The Phi Delta team was drafted
from the gridiron, with All-American
Heller, Howdy O’Dell, Bob Hoel, and
Jimmy Simms. The driver was
Frank MacLean. This team had an
accident at dead man’s curve but
continued to take its heat.

Among the women, Delta Delta
Delta turned in the outstanding rec-
ord for Friday’s events, winning ﬁrst
place both in the Parade of the
Pantherettes” and in the scooter re-
lay.

Delta Zeta won the remaining con-
test, the hoop rolling -relay. Second
place in the ﬂoat parade went to
Alpha Epsilon Phi, and the third cup
was awarded to Chi Omega. The
three winning ﬂoats were “Louisiana
Hayride.” “Japanese Sandman,” and
“Sitting on top of the World.”

The ﬂoats were judged on the basis
of origiiiiality of interpretation and
accuracy in depicting popular songs
written since 1920.

The university spoon, which ﬁrst
made its appearance in 1871, was
handed down to the junior class by
Daniel Smith, Eng. ’33, chairman of
spring festival, on behalf of the grad-
uating class. Leroy Lewis, Col. ’34,
accepted for his class.

In making the presentation, Smith
narrated some of the hi.-storical and
traditional aspects of the spoon. The
spoon, almost ﬁve feet in length, was

in front of the predecessor of Pitt,
the Western University of Pennsyl-
vania, when it was located on a cor-
ner of Cherry Alley, It was ﬁrst used
as a disciplinary. symbol, and was
presented to the seniors in 1871 to
emphasize the childishness of their
actions at that time. The seniors
then proceeded to make it an annual
gift to the juniors until it mysteri-
ously disappeared, Recently it was
recovered and is now under the care
and protection of J. G. Quick, univer-
sity registrar.

Dave Lewis’ "Pitt Razz” made its ap-
pearance after the various presenta-
tions, and carried a splash makeup,
obviously resembling a downtown aft-
ernoon paper. The top streamer
shouted, “Cathedral Swiped” and was
followed up by “Campus saddened by
Theft of Building; Trustee Happy.”
Another streamer disclosed that
“sweatshop Evils Prevail at Heinz

shot of the month was a bootleg pic-
ture of the “Coalition Forces Decid-
ing Fate of University,” amidst beer
bottles and general disorder. A few
jabs at the Pitt News and some of its
staff members, a takeoff on Arthur
Brisbane, 3. page one story insisting
that “Trustees Urge Beer Drinking on
Pitt Campus,” and a general ridicule
of many campus institutions com-
pleted the issue.

,Fairchild Speaks

On Proﬁt System

Social Science Seminar Features
Famous N. Y. U. Professor

Friday’s meeting 0f the Social Sci-
ence Seminar heard Dr. Henry Pratt
Fairchild, of New York University,
speak on, “Proﬁts or Prosperity?”
The talk was featured by a vigorous
attack upon the proﬁt system, which
the New York professor termed “a
mathematical impossibility.”

The well-known economist, whose
articles have appeared in Harper’s
Magazine, explained his thesis by giv-
ing the example of a self-suiiicient
community into which a manufacturer
comes and presents the only source
of income for the people.

“The product of the industry,” he
pointed out, “is equal in value to the
income of the townspeople. How,
then, can the manufacturer make any
proﬁt if he hopes to sell all his goods
{in this self-contained city?” Dis-
I cussion followed the address.

As a relief from the present sys-
item, where he declares depressions
lare inevitable, Dr. Fairchild advocated
a growing socialization of industry in
the United States. For the present,

of at least the basic industries with
the proﬁt motive removed.

Meetings of the seminar feature na-
tionally prominent men each month.
Dr, Paul F. Shupp, associate pro-
fessor of history, is president of the
group.

Upsilon, honorary chemistry and chem-

place Saturday, May 13, at South Park.
The affair is open only to members
and alumni of the fraternity.

Earl Gulbransen, president of the

Waugh, T. Dunkelberger and Gregg
Noble as the committee in charge of
the picnic.

 

SHOULDER WIDTH

The chic of the new spring suits
and coats depends largely upon the
novelty of their shoulder treatments.
There is Mme. Schiaparelli, for in-
stance, who is of the younger gener-
ation of Paris couturiers and who is
especiallygifted in the creation of
original sportswear. None other but
a designer of renown would dare do
the unique things she does to achieve
shoulder width. Bright blue woolen
with a slightly darker blue for the
skirt fashions the sprightly Schiapar-
elli suit pictured. Copper links fasten
the jacket. The blouse is of powder
blue crepe. The hat represents a ver-
sion of the new style which trends to
crown height.

Robbins Answers
Druids’ Charges

 

Campbell, Golanty Withdrew from
Meeting, Statements Say

 

The controversy over Druid elec- ~

tion procedure did not close with the
admission of twelve men into the or-
ganization at tapping exercises Fri-
day. Today the News prints a. letter
from Irving D. Robbins, who resign-
ed from the group because “the best
men were not chosen” in an election
he branded “a farce."

In his letter to the editor, Robbins
answers charges made by the Druids
in last Friday's News that he had
violated the spirit of the honorary by
resigning, the ethics of secret mem-
bership by revealing the method of
election, and the truth itself by say-
ing that Donald Campbell and George
Golanty had left the meeting with
him.

“There was nothing unethical in
stating the election procedure of the
organization,” says Robbins’ letter in
part. “The procedure is printed in
the constitution, a copy of which has
been on ﬁle in the oﬁice of the Dean
of Men. Excerpts from the constitu-
tion have been printed in the News.”

Robbins further attacks the group

by declaring that the most outstand-
ing freshmen were not elected to
Druids. He cites activities records of
both tappees and unrecognized men
to prove his point. His letter
says, “It was freely stated by
members of Druids that prejudice had
to enter into the elections to Druids
in order to insure having a group
that would work together. I submit
that the above is an admission that
consideration was not given on a
basis of value in activities, and that
the society does not recognize worth
as such."

According to the letter of the Druid
spokesmen in Friday's News, “Mr.
Robbins also quoted that three mem-
bers withdrew from the meeting up-
on announcement of the names of the
newly-elected candidates. We wish
to correct this -statement by saying

that he was the only member who

Donald Campbell, in a statement
to the News yesterday, said, “Regard-
ing the statement printed in the
News, I wish to say that I left the
meeeting in company with Robbins
and Golanty. I was of the same opin-
ion on the matter of the elections as
expressed by Robbins and disgusted
with the whole procedure.

George Golanty said-, “I wish to
state in direct denial of the state-
ment issued by the majority coali-
tion in Druids that I did withdraw
from the election meeting of the or-
ganization at the same time as and in
gompany with Campbell and Rob-

1ns.”

The Student Council of the YM-
YWHA has ﬁnally secured Versatile
Artie Stector and his orchestra for
the Spring Garden Dance Saturday
night. The affair is the last one of
the semester and since the plans for
the entertainment and decorations are
elaborate it should surpass all other
social events which have taken place
at the Y, sponsored by the Student
Council. The entire studio will be
made to look so much like a garden
that those who have frequented for-
mer dances will not recognize it.
Spotlights will play upon the dancers
and the new ﬂoor recently inlaid in
the studio.

Beatrice Kopsofsky, Col. '34, chair-
man of the dance, has arranged for
several members of the orchestra to
give solo numbers for which they have
already-won acclaim. Check room
service will be available on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor.

The ping pong tournament under
the chairmanship of Frieda Goldstein,
Col. '35, swung into action yesterday.
All told there are sixteen contestants
for the match and during the tourna-
ment the contestants will adhere to
the International rules, The matches
will be played oﬁ as quickly as pos-
sible in the ping p'ong_room at the Y.

Sharon Declared Winner
Ct 26th Scholastic Track
And Field Meet, Saturday

Two School Boy Records Eclipsed,-One Tied, During Afternoon
In Which Rain and Mud Play Prominent Part; Pryor,

 

Ford City Wins Indivi

“For a track meet, it was agood day for a swimming champion-

ship,” was the opinion of many

to the Stadium Saturday afternoon to watch the schoolboy guests
of the University during the twenty-sixth annual Pitt Scholastic invi-
But to the 600 athletes who Went
through their paces for glory and place prizes it proved another

station track and ﬁeld meet.

“win ’em, anyhow” afternoon.
A downpour of rain met the ath

letes as they took their places for the I (;,.ee,,.,me_ t,',i,.d_ Heigh.,_6 feet 1 inch
trials in the 100-yard dash event, and
continued throughout the major part
of the afternoon, with the track, in
places, covered to a, depth of a half
inch. - But the ﬂooded track and soggy
practice ﬁeld didn’t prevent the dis-
trict schoolboys from hanging up two

new records and tying another,

A quartet of stars from Sharon high

school went home at the close of the
meet with the afternoon's chief prize

——-the team trophy—forging ahead of

East Huntingdon high school after the
results of the last two events of the
afternoon—the broad jump and the
880-yard dash had been recorded. A
ﬁrst and second place in the jump
and a. ﬁrst place in the dash gave
Coach Dave Stewart's proteges 13
points, to have his athletes nose out
East Huntingdon by three points.
Linsley Institute of Wheeling, W. Va.,
collected 12 points to be declared third
place winner of the scholastic meet.

O’Di1e Pryor, of Ford City, who_ col-
lected all ten of his team's DOIDILS.
and won the high individual score
trophy in his heat in the 100-Yard
trials tied his last year's record when
he sped through the rain in ten sec-
onds ﬂat, In winning the ﬁnals he re-
peated his performance of the earlier
dash.

While the trackmen were tying rec-
ords, the ﬁeld men were hanging up
new ones. Two records were erased
from the books during the afternoon.
The ﬁrst one announced was in the
high jump event where Bennet of
Bridgeville and Lewis of Rankin, tied
for ﬁrst place with jumps of 6 feet, 1
inch. Shortly after the score tabula-
tors announced another meet record

looked on and asked questions Dr. J.
B. Sutherland and his coaching corps
put tackles, guards, centers, and back-
ﬁeld men through their paces at the

Saturday morning at the Stadium,

Rain, which fell constantly during
the “school” hours, caused a shifting

practice ﬁeld to the Stadium.

I As the coaches ﬁled through the
-‘Stadium gates, they were ushered to
' areas of the ﬁeld where a sign direct-
ed them to where the various playing
position clinics were being conducted.

Proper line positions for plunging;_
passing, kicking, and running; and
backﬁeld formations were discussed
by the Dr. Sutherland, head football
Icoach, and assistant coaches Ray
Montgomery, Andy Gustafson, Bill
Kern, and Ralph Daugherty during
the three-hourclinic session, .

The clinic brought to a close the
six weeks spring football training
period which has been going since
the latter part of March.

ant to the dean of men, for the newly
organized interfraternity mushbau
league. Fifteen fraternities have sig-
niﬁed intention of entering teams.

The league will work on a tourna-

ment elimination basis, with eight
teams in the upper bracket and seven
in the lower. All ﬁrst round games
must be played oil? by this Friday
evening, according to an announce-
ment by Peter Pingetore and Allison
Imler, co-chairmen of the circuit.

a ten point advantage over the Moun-
taineer runners when the events had
been tabulated. Aiheavy ﬁeld, day for
the West Virginiayarsity gave them
their one point advantage over the
Panthers. ,

Two sweeps were recorded for the
Panthers‘; in the 440-yard dash where
Keller, McDonald, and Kiger splashed
across the tape in. a one, two, three
order and in the 880-yard run where
Keller, Watkins, and Kirkpatrick ﬁn-
ished in a similar manner. But the
West Virginia runners held the ad-
vantage in ﬁrst places in the other
dash events, gaining four while the
Panthers collected three for their ef-
forts.

Six ﬁrst places, one second place
and four third places in the ﬁeld
events aided the West Virginia track-
men to take home the afternoon's ﬁrst
place prize, In the pole vault Perriott,
Sortet and Fownes divided the three
place points in tying at the height of
eleven feet, four inches. In the other
ﬁeld events, Miller tossed the ham-
mer 158 feet, 6 inches through the
rain’ and mud to turn in a remarkable
performance in that event, ~ and
Mentzer hurled the javelin 168 feet to
beat out Gongloﬁ.

A first’ in the broad jump, ﬁrst in
the 120-yard high hurdles, and a tie

event, gave Bailey of West Virginia
the high individual score record of
the varsity meet, Keller with a ﬁrst
in the 440 and 88-yard dashes and a
second in the 220-yard event, col-
lected 13 points for a second place.
In all, West Virginia scored ten
ﬁrst, three second, and ﬁve third
places in the ﬁfteen events as the
Panthers piled up four ﬁrst, eleven
second, and ten third places during
lthe afternoon.
-. The fresh, however, didn’t follow
Ithe footsteps of their older brothers.
Grabbing off the lead after the ﬁrst
events, the fresh continued to add
to their advantage during the after-
noon, to score a. seventeen point vic-
tory over the West Virginia plebes.

points with four ﬁrst, two second, and
one third places. Running from the
practice ﬁeld to the Stadium to enter

hurdles. hammer throw, shot put, the
120-yard high hurdles, and the discus

This afternoon the frosh will par-
ticipate in their third track meet of
the year, meeting Oliver high school
at the Stadium. Saturday afternoon
the varsity trackmen will be host to
the Penn State track and ﬁeld men

Mines Seminar Discusses
Dance In Last Meeting

 

The last general seminar meeting for
the school of mines on last Thursday,
noon, took the place of the separate
department meetings during the past
year. James Roche, oil and gas ’33,
president of the school of mines or-
ganization, gave a summary and fare-
well talk. He stressed the highlights
in the past yea.r, and mentioned the
various activities that had been suc-
cessfully undertaken.

It was announced that this would
be the last year when officers will be
elected for the school of mines
group. Hereafter, the newly organ-
ized school of mines cabinet will
have charge of all school affairs and
general seminars.

Discussion also centered about the
school of mines dance that will take
place on Friday evening, at the Pines
on Perrysville Highway. A report
by the ticket committee showed that
the sale was advancing favorably.

A Farewell

OMORROW evening we bid farewell to another Student Coun-

cil—and a study of the acts and actions of this, the tenth,"‘legis-
lature” measures up to, and exceeds, in some instances, the stained
heritage passed on to it by the preceding one. At times Student
Council this year has threatened to break away from the traditions
of the past, but as always—-—futilely. We have often Wondered why,
and revelations after the search for a justiﬁable answer which has
led us through the pages of the ﬁles of the “Pitt Weekly” since the
time of the creation of the ﬁrst Student Council in 1923, have, in-
deed, not been surprising.

Headlines have screamed" their charges of control by a few;
stories have uncovered the petty trading for internal and external
positions; and editorials have spoken of the ever pervading dis-
trust of Student Council by those outside of its membership. So
steeped in this tradition of patronage trading, favoritism, and po-
litical isolation has each succeeding Student Council become, that
now Councillors seem to take this heritage as a part of their mem-
bership to the student “legislature ;” that they must continue in
the light of past events to add to the unwholesomeness of this stu-
dent activity.

But at times, the Student Council of the present year has shown
promise of unleashing itself from the tentacles of that deeply‘ rooted
tradition, which, when members of the present “legislature” relin-
quish the gavel of control tomorrow evening, will mark the Council
of this ‘year as one that had the feeling that it wanted to do some-
thing worthwhile. Such projects as a. full-time Student Health
Service, a Student Union; the study of the social calendar to mini-
piize the sad results of overcrowding certainly deserve commenda-

ion.

So it comes that a new Student Council takes its place tomorrow
‘evening to take up the duties of a student legislature and accept or
refute the traditions of the past.

Is it not time for an awakening and a disillusionment on the
part of those accustomed blindly to cling to preconceived notions or
ideas? Or must another year of desultory infantile wish fulﬁllment
mark the path of the incoming Student Council. Surely there is a
need of better student organization on the campus, and it must be
conceded that during a few altogether too brief moments the Coun-
cil of this year saw that need and enlisted itself on the side‘ ofthe
student body. But each time tradition reached out to throttle any
sustained action.

So we bid a goodbye to the Student Council of this year, with
neither rancor in our hearts nor malice in our words, and with this
adieu “Though thy feet did falter, thy head was strong in the wis-
dom of thyself,” and hope that the Student Council of the coming
year discard the heritage of the past, to concentrate on the ideals
of the future.

=3 ¥ #< 43

The almost traditional American indifference to the
opinions of college students loses some of its weight with the com-
parison of the platform of the Model Political Convention which took
place here last fall, and the economical and social activities upon
which the Roosevelt administration is at the moment embarking.
The operation of Muscle Shoals by the government, a 500 million
dollar relief measure, and a planned economy for American indus-
tries, all cited by Mr. Roosevelt in his radio address Sunday night
as future activities of his administration, were included in the Pitt

convention platform. .
Q 1: :1: .,

The Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club’s efforts in
the drafting of a constitution and organizing a library of librettos
and musical scores of former shows are commendable as forward
steps ‘in making the Cap and Gown show a really student affair.
Certainly the men whose initiative and effort yearly results in a
major dramatic production which has become one of the Univer-
sity’s major activities will show activity which will in time result
in a show entirely of and by the students of this institution.

 Looking Out

...ByVV.F.A....

30:.

HE recent kidnapping of a child in Massachusetts has called out
from an indignant press the demand for more stringent punish-
ments for persons guilty of that crime. While citizens and the press
are rightfully entitled to indignation at a ﬂagrant disregard for so-
cial organization as kidnapping has become in recent years I hardly
think that the Massachusetts case proves that kidnapping is to be

prevented by the threat of greater punishments_
In the case that occupied a front%
page position last week, the guilty! -
man was unemployed. It requires no professlonam And’ as

the victims

great amount of knowledge to deter-
mine that the crime might have been
prevented had he had a. job.

Such simple sociology is not to be
applied in the numerous other kid-
nappings that daily engage the atten-

are often adults, the news of them

never reaches the ears of the police.
Often, of course, it would do no good
to set the police on the trail. In
some communities — Chicago imme-
diately occurs to one—the criminals

of the “snatching” is carried on by the police or have bought them olf.

more or less able to deal with pick-
pockets and horse thieves, have lost
what little grip they had on kidnap-

pers.
The Helpless Police

The police are hardly to blame. By
law they have been set to tracking
down men guilty of a highly popular
crime, namely, the dispensing of ii-
quors. While they might have given
their full attentions to the genuinely
anti-social elements in our commu-
nity, they have frittered away time
and energy in the thankless task of
breaking down speakeasy doors and
busting up bar ﬁxtures. l

Prohibition, winked at as it has
been, has served to dramatize for the
public at least the simple truth that
police and detective forces in the

United States are not organized for
crook catching. The crafty Sherlock
Holmes is only a ﬁgure of ﬁction for
us. He does not exist. He couldn’t,
for if one by some chance appeared
on a. city pay-roll, his presence would
soon become: distasteful to the in-
trenched political machine.

_ Organized as they are, it is no won-
der then that the forces of the law
are unable to meet the kidnapper on
his own ground. Americans, anarch-
istsby nature and tradition as Shaw
has declared, have found the best
way is to pay and keep, quiet. For
all practical purposes, that is -the
best way. Instead of calling in the
police, we now try to keep them
away while making the best terms we
can with the criminals’ interme-
diaries.

The Eiusive Remedy

The average college man or wo-
man, with three hours of social
science on record, feels competent to
pass a ﬁnal judgment on such crime
by the formula of education against
it. It isn’t, of course, as simple as
all that. Education is a. slow thing.
And we know well that when school
propaganda is attempted, it is too
poorly disguised to take in even a
child. I would put more trust in the
natural, widespread reaction to such
crime, We have failed to educate
crime in general out of our citizenry.
Our only hope now is to coax them
away from particularly offensive vari-
eties.

The whole matter is immensely
complicated by -the important place
that law breaking has in our commu-
nity. ‘We could not live without it,
or, rather, living would be less-enjoy-
able without it. Absurd perhaps, but
it is nevertheless true that we haven’t
the least desire to eliminate crime.
We want to rid ourselves of certain
varieties of it.

Our diﬂiculty is that we cannot get
enough people to decide what is and
what isn’t criminal. Most millionaires
would agree that half the Commun-
ists ought to be in jail. And most
Communists would agree that allthe
millionaires ought to be there. The
ordinary, law abiding citizen feels a
deep indignation when the Federals
pinch Harry, the citizen’s favorite
speakeasy proprietor. Yet that same
citizen is pleased to hear that the big
shot who supplies Harry has been
sent to Atlanta for a long stretch.

The Wet Remedy

Often we hear that the repeal of
prohibition will be the death knoll of
the gangster, for his proﬁts. from li-
quor will go, a.nd he will go with
them. On the contrary I am willing
to believe that the gangster, losing
his liquor racket (if he does!), will
turn his attentions to other popular
commodities. In fact, he has already.
He has levied a sales tax on foods in
metropolitan areas. Called. in origin-
ally to serve as the strong arm squad
of the trade unions, he has made- him-
self boss in many of those organiza-
tions.

It is nothing, I think, to get excited
about. The history of any great cor-
poration is a history of graft and cor-
ruption. We have not yet got around
to legalizing the variety of business
that the racketeer carries on. The
gangster today represents, perhaps,
the culmination of a hundred and ﬁfty
years of lawlessness. We may see in
the future the passing of the racket
as we are seeing right now the pass-
ing of his blood brother, laissez faire
business enterprise.

But the elimination of crime, like
the socialization of the shoe-repairing
industry, will not be accomplished
during Roosevelt’s second term.

I would have preferred to consider the matter of the Druid elec-
tions and my resignation from the organization closed, but inasmuch
as the letter from the organization, printed in the News of Friday,
May 5, accused me of unethical conduct, I should like further to

clarify my stand on the matter.

First of all I objected to the election because I believe that the
organization did not elect the best men, based on the purpose of the

society to select the
freshmen and ﬁrst semester sopho-

mores in student activities. The
dominant faction in Druids allowed
prejudice and aﬂiliation to sway them
in their choice of new members.

To support this contention I should
like to point out that the ‘recent

._tappees toqDruids there is one man

with no recognized student activities
at all; one man with no activities ex‘
.cept an apprentice managership of an
athletic team; one man on the spring
festival committee and production
staff of Cap and Gown; one manon
the Freshman dance committee and
business staff of Cap and Gown; one
man an apprentice managerand a cir-
culationstaﬁ member of the Panther.
I have selected these men as probably
not outstanding because by the very
nature of these activities it would be
almost impossible to have taken an
important part during the freshman
year. Of course the men mentioned
above cannot be held responsible for
their mis-election, the fault lies with
the old Druids, I feel that a. candi-
date may be outstanding, though he
may have only one activity. For that
reason I do not object to honoring the
head of Cap and Gown, etc.

However, I have investigated the
records of some of the outstanding
freshmen who did not make Druids.
One took a leading role in a major
production of Pitt Players, Went on a.
Northern trip of the Men’s Debating
Association, and spent between 20
and 30 hours a week working on the
Pitt News. A second freshman was
named advertising manager of the
Owl. A third was the only freshman
to be called before the point scale
committee for excess activities; his
activities were: debating, News,
Pitt Players, an apprentice manager-
ship, and chairman of two standing
committees of the YMCA. A fourth
freshman, who did not make Druids,
is an outstanding star of both the
swimming and tennis teams and a.
member of the Glee Club. A ﬁfth is
on the Owl, is one of the best fresh-
men working on the Pitt News, was a
member of the spring festival com-
mittee, and is on the freshman tennis
squad. I believe the men I have listed
above are adequate reason for any ob-

jection to the men elected to the so-.

ciety.
It was freely stated by members of

Druids that prejudice had to enter into ,

the elections to Druids in order to in-
sure having a group that would work
together. I submit that the above is
an admission that consideration was
not given on a basisiof value in activi-
ties, and that the society does not
recognize worth as such.

I should like to clarify the im-
pression that I had an opportunity to
object to the men elected to the so-
ciety before the names were an-
nounced, All men were voted on be-
fore any announcement of the suc-
cessful candidates was made; so it is
obvious that there could have been no
reason for protest until the names
were announced.

There was nothing unethical in
stating the election procedure of the
organization. The procedure is
printed in the constitution, a copy of
which has been on ﬁle in the oﬁice of
the Dean of Men. Excerpts from the
constitution have been printed in the
News. -

If ethical conduct means com-
placontly sitting back and allowing
prejudice to have full sway, “string-
ing along” while a. coalition runs
things to suit itself, then I see noth-
ing wrong with “unethical conduct.”
I was charged with “unethical con-
duct” because I didn’t keep quiet and
allow the “majority” to run things
the way they liked. It might be wise
to investigate, as to ethics the con-
duct of a group who disregarded the
real purpose of the organization in
order to further their own interests.

I have been accused of not being
in “spirit” with the; functions of the

IRVING D. ROBBINS.

Our cathedral is far from being a
fearful “conglomerate bee-hive of old
world relics” throughout its forty
stofies, as Don Early suggested and
predicted in his column in last Fri-
day's News. The plans of the Cathe-

dral have been modeled on the most-

modern principles.

The nationality memorial rooms
are not to be distributed throughout
the forty stories, as is erroneously
stated by Mr. Early; but are to. be
conﬁned entirely to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
This is according to a. very deﬁnite
plan, The Cathedral rests on its ﬁrst-
ﬂoor rooms as our own American cul-
ture rests on old world heritage. The
second-ﬂoor classrooms follow out the
idea by being typically pioneer Amer-
ican; _while the third-ﬂoor rooms are
to be designed according to America's
newest, most modernistic concepts of
artistic furnishing and interior decor-
ating. This ﬂoor prefaces the remain-
ing thirty-seven stories which tower
into the sky expressing the newest
ideas in learning, and architectural
design.

Already we see signs of these mod-
ern architectural plans. The eleva-
tors, their plain black doors, the
plumbing with its black and white
glass ﬁnishings, the.perma.nent doors
of black with their white glass, could
scarcely be called “old museum
relics.” The Cathedral predicts mod-
ern treatment——It is modern!

These ﬁrst-ﬂoor rooms are not dis-
tinctly period rooms, “something
sharply, resembling a museum,” as
Mr, Early writes, but have been de-
signed by contemporary architects in
the various countries. Anyone who
has seen the designs can understand
that the architects have not only ex-
pressed their national culture adapted
to modern usage in the furnishings
and decoration, but have employed
mass, line, and color treatment that
is more modern than America’s mod-

ernness.
s I 9
Where did America s modern move-

ment come from, but from Europe?‘

Where did the newest ideas in Uni-
versity methods, small dormitories,
honors systems, research work have
their origin, but in European coun-
tries. In paying tribute to European
culture by these ﬁrst ﬂoor memorial
rooms, we express our indebtedness
not only for the old world heritage,
but for its modernistic movement that
we have made our own._

Our Cathedral is, inside and out—-
a tower of aspiration. 8- MODERN Sky’

resourcefulness . . .

Time and again, Bell System engineers have
demonstrated their pioneering bent in working out
unusual telephone construction problems.

For example, they laid a huge conduit under the
Harlem River. They dredged a trench in the river
bottom, lowered enormous sections of iron pipe,
sent down divers to join the sections, encased the
ﬁnished tube in concrete. Through this they ran
telephone cables forming one of New York’s main

lines of communication.
Arizona they constructed
long. To bridge oceans,

Across the Gila River in
a catenary span 2373 feet
they developed radio tele-

phony. They havc built telephone lines over moun-
tains, across deserts, through swamps.

Their resourcefulness in getting through, over or
under natural barriers makes possible telephone ser-
vice that is practically world wide in reach.
