Ex-official
attacks CIA
operations

By Michael Fay
And Todd Erkel
The Pitt News

“Worldwide destabilization through ter-
rorism, corruption and false propaganda
has been standard practice in the United
States Central Intelligence Agency since its
inception in I947, according to a former
high-ranking CIA official who spoke to sev-
eral hundred students at David Lawrence
Auditorium last night.

John Stockwell, the highest-ranking ex-
official ever to speak out against the CIA,
claimed that the agency supports only
executive-branch and corporate interests,

 not democracies. He said that the agency

has, in the past, “overthrown at least I8
democracies in favor of military regimes.”

According to Stockwell, the CIA has
undermined these governments in the hopes
of installing corrupt military leaders who
would maintain order and protect U.S.
interests. This policy, he said, backfires
more often then not and results in public
embarrassment and disgrace for the United
States.

He mentioned Chile, Guatemala and the
Belgian Congo as past examples of this type
of operation. He also said that current CIA
destabilization in Nicaragua closely resem-
bles those previous interventions.

“Destabilization is not a pleasant thing,”
Stockwell said. “It is not a nice thing to do to
people, and we are doing it in Nicaragua
todayf’

Stockwell drew a parallel between his own
experiences as manager of covert action in
the southwest African nation of Angola and
the current covert operation in Nicaragua.
He said that the United States has conducted
20,000 such operations since the inception of
the CIA.

According to Stockwell, the United States
is arming a band of mercenaries to‘ over-
throw the Nicaraguan government. In both
cases, Stockwell said, the CIA has perpe-
trated the idea that Soviet aggression is to
blame for the trouble in the area.

“What they told me was that the Soviets
were moving to take advantage of our wea-
kness after Vietnam,” Stockwell said. “We
were lying to the world, lying to the Con-
gress, lying to the United Nations.

“I went out there with blinders on, fight-
ing Communists.”

On the U.S. involvement in neighboring
El Salvador, Stockwell said that about one-
half of the arms and other military aid that
reaches the area ends up in the hands ofthe
rebels.

Stockwell, who began his service with the
CIA in I964 as a case officer, became dis-
gusted with CIA atrocities in Vietnam.

He later came to Washington, D.C., in
I975-76 in an attempt to understand the
workings of the agency as an insider. He sat
on the Working Group on Angola, a sub-
committee of the National Security Council.

“I found fat old men sleeping through
subcommittee meetings,” Stockwell said.

Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale spoke at a
A.F.L.- C.I.O convention held at the downtown Hilton Hotel.

Mondale campaigns here,
attacks Hart’s labor record

Democratic candidate Walter
Mondale attacked rival candidate
Gary Hart for his labor policies while
reaffirming his own strong ties to
workers at an AFL-CIO convention
in downtown Pittsburgh yesterday.

Mondale, who is leading by seven
points in a Gannett News statewide
poll, said his goal was to put America
back to work. He also took the oppor-
tunity to criticize President Ronald
Reagan‘s labor record and emphas-
ized that if workers want to change the
present government trend, they must
send that message to Washington,
D.C.

Reagan also delivered a similar
campaign-style speech to a meeting of
insurance agents in Washington, D.C.
He charged that liberal politicians
have brought the country to “the edge

of economic catastrophe” by fighting
the business community.

An early turnout was reported in
Connecticut, where polls were open
for the presidential primary, but Hart
won an overwhelming victory at the
polls. The win gives Hart a clean
sweep of the primaries in all six New
England states and brings with it 33
Hart delegates to Mondale’s I8 and
Jesse Jackson’s one.

According to an exit poll, the Colo-
rado senatofdid well in virtually every
part of the state, with a strong show-
ing among the young and affluent
voters.

Mondale congratulated Hart but
added that Connecticut was a state in.
which he did not spend much time
campaigning.

Mitterand
encourages

free ﬂow of
knowledge

By Gabrielle Pease
The Pitt News

See photo, page 3

French president Francois Mitterand
stopped in Pittsburgh last night to show sup-
port for the exchange of computer technol-
ogy between the Robotics Institute at
Carnegie-Mellon University and The World
Center for Personal Computation and
Human Resources in France.

Mitterand told faculty and students that
he wants to forge stronger links between
Pittsburgh and France to encourage a freer

in a war against ignorance.’
—— Richard Cyert

flow of creative knowledge.

In a welcoming speech entitled “The New
Developments of Man Through Computer
Science,” Mitterand suggested that all uni-

' versities follow a route that would promote

computer literacy. Sharing this knowledge,
he said, would encourage “solidarity
between the haves and the have riots.”

Mitterand presented the Knighthood of
the Legion of Honor Award to CMU robot-
ics professor Raj Reddy for his work as a
liaison between the two institutes.

In his acceptance speech, Reddy called
France a leader in cooperation between
nations. “Computer technology makes rapid
sharing of knowledge possible," he said. It
produces the ideas that move people, he
added. ,

University president Richard Cyert said
France and CM U are allies in a war against
ignorance.

A crowd ofcheering students waited in the
rain to meet Mitterand outside ofthe Skibo
Hall Ballroom. Flight delays made him 50
minutes late for his address, but that did not
affect the numbers that turned out to see
him. The speech itself was closed, but stu-
dents watched on closed-circuit television
monitors in the hall.

In his speech, Mitterand also called for a
plan to be developed in the manner of the
Marshall Plan, which was designed to rede-
velop war—torn Europe. The plan, when
implemented, will allow for the exchange of
scientific knowledge between all countries.

Such progress, he said, is important to the
development of renaissance in Pittsburgh
and in France. -

Mitterand drew parallels between the
problems each country has with heavy
industry and economic reform. He cited
Pittsburgh’s success in reducing unemploy-
ment as an encouragement to French
industry.

Mitterand declared that France would
associate closely with world industry. He
called for human resources to bring people
together.

“The aim of our efforts lies in the capacity
for each man to achieve his talents," he said.

Pitt’s social work seniors learn latest job trends

By John Gambesda
The Pitt News

Graduating seniors from Pitt‘s »

School of Social Work participated
in a series of workshops Monday
aimed at easing their transition into
the working world.

Alma Wisniewski, senior student
coordinator of a sexual abuse work-
shop, discussed a program for
offenders entitled “Together We
Can.”

“There is no cure but control, and
the offenders and victims are taught
to identify their base feelings and
learn their method of operation in
order that they don’t go out and
molest again,” Wisniewski said.

Sexual abuse was just one of ﬁve
workshops held on Monday as part
of a spring conference entitled
“From Out of the Closet and Into
the Field."

Caroline Russell, director of
“Together We Can," a Pittsburgh
self-awareness program for sex
offenders and victims, conducted
the workshop, which allowed actual

abuse victims and sex offenders to
share their experiences with the stu-
dents through a question-and-
answer session.

“Since being in the group, I've
learned to sit by someone and let
them say it because this [the pro-
gram] is the place where we okay it
and feel better for it,” said Mary
Lou, a middle-aged woman who was
victimized at the age of seven.

Before open discussions took
place, Russell explained that it. is
important to be aware of how one
phrased questions to a victim.

“If you ask them, ‘Did it feel
good?,‘ you might be further setting
the victim into a guilt feeling,” Rus-
sell said. “Remember, a victim is the
victim, and they have no control
over being a victim."

Russell said it is important to put
all the blame and responsibility on
the offender and not to use the word
“relationship.”

“It is not a relationship,” Russell
said. “It’s a victimization; and there
are women offenders.”

According to Mary Lou, her son
was told to enter Russell’s awareness
program, and through his contact,

In I Cililtzrvrilillieslria/T e Pt! News
Caroline M. Russell

she soon entered the program's vic-
tims’ group.

“l’d managed to block it out real
well in my mind for some 30 to 40
years, and it finally came out when I
had to be in court with my son, who
is a sex offender for ﬂashing,” Mary
Lou said.

 

Mary Lou said the program gave
her a whole new image about herself
that she had not felt in years.

“At the trial, the defendant’s law-
yer made it look like the man had no
reason to do what he did...filling me
so full of fear and being so ashamed
of myself, I agreed that I was a liar,
and I told myself maybe he really
didn’t mean what I thought ,_he
meant to do, and so the man got
off," she said.

Russell pointed out that the vic-
tim’s saying no means very little to
the offender.

“It is important to try to instill in
the victim that saying no is all right
and that no really means no,” she
said.

Russell was also sexually abused
as a child. She said the man next
door would take the neighborhood
kids out for ice cream and he always
had her sit beside him. i

“When he started to put his hand
on my leg, it was scary; but I didn’t
know what he was doing. Ijust knew
it was scary,” Russell said. “Later, as
he got further up my leg, I moved
closer to my brother.”

Russell said the abuse continued

 

and then she finally told her mother
what was happening.

“My mother, in her ignorance. in
her state of denial, or whatever we
want to call it, said to me: ‘He is a
nice man, he buys you ice cream,‘ "
she said.

Many years after the incident,
Russell told of her experience on a
television interview. Her son and
daughter were appalled that their
mother could speak about such a
thing to the public. Because of her
children‘s reaction, Russell deve-
loped a program called “It‘s All
Right to Talk About It.”

Milton Grady, a member of the
National Association of Social
Workers‘ metropolitan Washing-
ton, D.C., chapter gave the keynote
address Monday afternoon.
According to Grady, the four main
concerns in the area of social work
are teenage pregnancy, prescription
drug use, homosexual concerns and
euthanasia/ right-to-life issues.

Other workshops included
“Abuse of Medication,” “Abuse of
the Homeless” and “Helping Fami-
lies Cope With Mentally Ill Adults.”

Vacancy

The last University Senate meeting was attended by some
very prominent individuals at this campus. One of whom was
the chancellor, who explained his meetings with Pennsylvania
governor Diclt Thornburgh. Some very prominent individuals
were not there, mainly Pitt students —- Pitt’s student represen-
tatives to be more exact.

There are I4 standing committees, all of which have some
student input, but from the senate head, Richard Tobias, few
students attend these meetings either. According to Tobias, the
untapped strength of the students in these committees could
rival and possibly capture the legislative power of the senate.

Chairman of the Senate Budget Policies Committee Wilfred
Daehnick has said that his committee averages possibly one
student per meeting. There are supposed to be three student
representatives on this committee.

Daehnick said that he can understand that some of the issues
may not be of such great importance to the students and,
therefore, they may not always show up. We can not be so
forgiving. Student representatives have missed meetings that
have tackled such issues as tuition charges, dormitory services
and more. Said Daehnick, “[to me], it is a concern that they
[students] are typically absent.” .

There also seems to be a problem replacing students on the
committees. A random sampling of 27 students, out of the 69
listed as student representatives, revealed that at least two had
graduated, while another two had resigned.

The problem doesn’t seem to be as pervasive among the
College of General Studies representatives as it does among
those from the College of Arts and Sciences. There does appear
to be some students who’ve taken the responsibility, invested in
them by the students at Pitt, seriously. Most notable is Bob
Ewald. I

According to one highly-placed source in the University
Senate, student participation at the sub-committee level is

non-existent. . ~ _
Later this week, the Student Government Board Wlll select a

new slate of students representatives. It is our hope that they
will assume their roles with a greater sense of resposibilty.

This is a very powerful organization, and the lack of student
input effectively stifles student involvement in university deci-
sions. One possible solution to the absenteeism is to have
student representatives who’ve accumulated three or more
absences kicked off the University Senate. This is the same
requirement that faculty members must meet. If students wish
to be treated as adults, they should also have comparable
responsibilities.

  After Five

Today is the fifth anniversary of the accident at the Three

’ Mile Island nuclear power plant. Immediately following the

accident there was world—wide reaction; outrage by Americans,
denials by the companies involved. A lot has happened since
then, a lot hasn’t.

An investigation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

(NRC) revealed an exhaustive list of improprieties. Accord-
ing to NRC charges, the company that ran the plant, the
General Public Utilities Corp. had covered up reports that
contaminated water had been leaking from the reactor, long
before the infamous March 28th incident.

The company was fined $40,000 last month for failing to
adequately protect workers safety and inform the NRC of an
accidental release of Krypton gas into the air. There have been
charges that the company fired several employees for wearing
extra safety gear. The damaged number two reactor is still
under clean-up operations, which have already cost one billion
dollars. The number one reactor was shut down soon after the
accident and has yet to be reopened.

Despite a non—binding vote by the people of Dauphin
County, the NRC has approved a plan that would allow the
company to restart the reactor as early as this summer.

There are too many unanswered questions as to the safety of
this plant and the safety of nuclear energy, in general. to allow
the start-up of this threatening menace.

Letters To The Editor

Plea for

a ‘normal’
lifestyle

I am prompted to write this in
response to S. Ahiarah’s letter to the
editor in the March 21 issue of The
Pitt News.

I am a homosexual. I have kept it
secret, which means that my sexual
life is limited to masturbating over
“Magnum P.I.” reruns. I am doing
my best to keep it -hidden, and it is
difficult. I guess I’ve developed into
quite an actor. But I am still scared
all the time that someone will dis-

' cover. I can’t even trust myself to

form a close friendship with anyone
of either sex.

My parents are happily married. I
had a good, stimulating childhood
with all the advantages. I've had
plenty of opportunities to date
attractive girls, and I have tried. I‘ve
undergone therapy several different
times without result. I would change
if I could. More than anything on
earth, I want to be “normal" —
heterosexual.

Like most people, I) have been
conditioned to regard homosexual-
ity as perverse, wrong in itself, a vio-
lation of nature, some sort of
disease, a thing of ridicule. I share
these feelings, thanks to encourage-
ment from my family, friends and
people like S. Ahiarah. I feel hypo-
critical. I can no more change my
aversion to it than I can change my
sexual leaning.

Go ahead and laugh. Criticize.
Argue. It's easy for “normal” people
to talk —— tell me something I haven't
heard. I am damned weary. I hate
being homosexual. I would choose
otherwise if I were able, but may I at
least retain dignity? What cures does
S. Ahiarah have in mind? Lobot-
omy? Castration? Removal? If we
are, as his (her?) letter states, “rav-
ages on society,” do we not deserve
at least some compassion as such?

Name Withheld By Request

Enough talk,
people are
what they are

It is with more alarm than fun that
I read of the continuing battle
between homosexual and heterosex-
ual behavior as to which is ‘‘normal'’
and who is proper. It appears as
though sexual behavior is the over-
whelming essence of our lives and
that one's sexual preferences have
national implications.

The fact is that we are many-
faceted individuals, each with much
to contribute to the world. We create
in many ways, and each person has
the ability to be a positive force in
bettering society. The overwhelming
question is within us, not within oth-
ers. That is, are we ourselves doing
all we can to be that positive source?

To concentrate on the behavior of
others, to judge others, is in effect to
try to escape facing our own
dilemma. However, the greatest sin
is when we prevent someone else
from contributing to society simply
because one aspect of their lives does
not mesh with ours. I certainly have
areas of my life that don't fit my own
values and expectations. I expect
Ms./Mr. Ahiarah, Kasofsky,
Wright and Solomons do, too.
Therefore, I pledge to keep my nose
into my own problems and away
from passing judgment on others
who have no connection with me.

_ Of all the aspects that make up
humanity, sexual preference seems
to me to be relatively insignificant.
While it is true that homosexuals
don’t procreate, there seems to be no
lack of willing replacements. While
it is true that male and female organs
are complementary, that doesn’t
make them perfect, nor does it make
the use of them perfect. Humans
have long declared that ingenuity

, was the mark of the human spirit,

allowing for inventive and satisfac-
tory solutions to problems.

Perhaps, then, it is the role of us
heterosexuals to pay homage to
homosexuals, who experienced a
problem and, in the true American
way, conquered it in the true pioneer
spirit! But for God’s sake, as well as
our own, let us recognize people for
who they are and what they can and
do contribute rather than make
them victims of single-issue
oppression.

Student Rep,

SGB _
unorganized

In response to the editorial “Miss-
ing Persons” that appeared in the
March 23 issue of The PittNews, I
wish to clear up a few misconceived
statements. The editorial claims that
the Student Government represen-
tatives in the University Senate are
not attending “crucial meetings“
that are held once a month. The edi-
torial blames the representatives for
not doing their jobs and suggests
that the representatives resign.

The University Senate is divided
into several committees, and the
Student Government Board selects

Wednesday, March 28, 1984 ;

students to “represent" the student *4?‘

body on those committees. Repre-
sentatives are told and encouraged
to attend their committee meetings
and not necessarily the monthly
university-wide senate meeting. In
fact, the respective committees in the
senate do not encourage their
members -— faculty as well as stu-
dents —— to attend the University
Senate meeting to which The Pitt
News was referring.

What is painfully obvious is that .1)

the absenteeism among student and
faculty members in the University
Senate is far more complex a prob-
lem than your “editorial” implied.
Instead of calling for the representa-
tives’ resignations, The Pitt News
“sure as hell ought to" do what a
good student newspaper would have
done much sooner. ‘

Rewrite your editorial on “Miss-
ing Persons" and title it “Missing
Coordination Leads to Missing Per-
sons." Instead of calling for resigna-
tions, call for the Student
Government Board to coordinate its
representatives as to insure that Uni-
versity Senate meetings are attended
by representatives. It’s somewhat
ridiculous for the SGB to attempt
successfully to organize a Student
Assembly when its organization of
senate representatives is poor at
best. Losing a full—time internship
office at Pitt is the result of very poor
organization of the SGB’s Univer-
sity Senate student representatives.
Things have gotten worse since then,

mi)

and student governance at Pitt is 3

small and rapidly diminishing. Get
organized, -SGB! Be responsible,
Pitt News!

government official. The circum-
stances indicate that there does exist
such a need. Edwin Meese, Presi-
dent Reagan’s personal assistant
and nominee to the attorney general
position, is in a rather precarious
position.

But so, too, is Reagan. Politics is a
strange game. It demands a high
degree of loyalty, but at times, this
loyalty must give way to intelligence.

It was Lincoln who said,“I must

stand with anyone that stands right,
stand with him while he is right and
part with him when he goes wrong.”
Reagan is in this position. It is time
to cut Ed Meese loose.

Two former presidents faced sim-
ilar circumstances, Carter with
Lance, and Nixon with Watergate.
One finally cut loose his albatross;
the other did not’. One became our
most disgraced president and abuser
of power. The other affair became
only a blemish on Carter’s
presidency.

The attorney general is the highest

ranking law enforcement official in
the United States. His record and
behavior as an official, both person-
ally and on thejob, must be spotless.
Questions and doubts about his
records cannot go unanswered. To
date, Meese’s answers are totally
unsatisfactory. How could heforget
a $15,000 loan to his wife?

The rest of his financial escapades
are no less suspicious than is his
lenders’ subsequent elevation to
appointed government positions.
This type of behavior is unconscia-
ble for a man who could be our

From where I stand/ Vicki Zeitner

attorney general. It is a blatant
abuse of power, and in the position
of attorney general, Meese could
have huge amounts of power at his
disposal. The thought of Meese in
that position brings back many
scary memories of past powerful
men run amok. The results were
disastrous.

Complicating all this is Meese’s
possible involvement in the Carter
briefing book scandal. Again,
behavior of this sort is intolerable in
an attorney general. And once

opened, the possible Pandora’s Box _

may bring forth further political
horrors. Reagan does not need this
around his neck. He has enough
problems to deal with already.

The country does not need this,
either. So cut loose Ed Meese, ship
him back to California to clear up
his debt problems. Loyalty, at this
point, is fruitless. In the past, it
brough about Watergate; we do not
need a “Meesegate.” End this farce,
Congress; turn Ed Meese down
now!

Communism and the hard sell

While at Pitt’s Latin American
Festival in Forbes Quadrangle two
weekends ago, a gentleman from
Peru asked me‘ if I was “with the
party.” After answering “no,” I was
asked if I was “not yet ready to make
the commitment.” I replied that my
only commitment at this point was
to studyrather than to support a
doctrine I did not fully understand.

Perhaps in response to my ten-
sion, the Peruvian then said, “the
problem with the radicals is that
they only read radical literature, and
the problem with the conservatives
is that they read nothing." Sigh! No
lecture on the evils of capitalism.

Throughout this term, l’ve talked
with several other students who

' believe that they are being pressured
to accept extremists‘ political views. I

These students said that they believe
they are being_ bombarded with pro-
poganda in the form of manipulative
presentations, oral persuasion and
simplistic literature.

I began to realize the real legiti-
macy of their concerns upon being
intellectually attacked when I
refused to buy a Communist
Workers’ Party paper. I say “intel-
lectually attacked” because the per-
son trying to push the paper (rather

than let me make my decision freely)
not only questioned my decision not
to buy the paper but proceeded to
argue that my personal reasons for
not wanting to buy the paper at a
reduced price were wrong and ill-
founded. So much for freedom of
choice.

Through their arrogance, extrem-
ists prove that they fail to under-
stand the complexities of the issues
they choose to exploit. Forstudents
who seek high quality education and
the freedom to form their own opin-
ions, this attitude is an extreme
annoyance.

Some students, like myself, are
highly critical of traditional U.S.
foreign and domestic policies and
realize that positive changes are
needed to secure a peaceful future.
However, this does not require us to
choose between communism and
capitalism. .

Under constant pressure to form
opinions and present arguments,
many students forget that they don’t
have to have fully developed opin-
ions and set positions on all issues.
They forget the pure purpose of col-
lege educatoin.» This is the danger of
the student. Those who believe they
must immediately possess a coher-

at Pitt

ent view of the world and a set of
consistent opinions on issues are the
most vulnerable in the face of propa-
ganda of information.

In response to this danger, it- is
important for students to investigate
and analyze differing points of view

..before taking a stand. Extremists

from both ends of the political spec-
trum battle to inﬂuence inquiring
minds in away that will favor their
positions. Students must continu-
ally question and besceptical of sim-
plistic arguments about complex
issues and defend their rights of
mind.

Denounce. ‘evil empire" syndrome

Speakers call for peace talks

By Michael Fay
The Pitt News

To end the threat of nuclear war,
the United States and the Soviet
Union must first understand each
other’s cultures and motivations,
according to speakers at an anti-
nuclear war workshop held Monday
at the First Baptist Church in
Oakland.

Richard Cottam, a Pitt political
science professor, said one of the
biggest obstacles to peace between
the superpowers is “the evil empire”
stereotype. A

“What if we find out that the
Soviets are also motivated by fear?”
Cottam asked the audience of 90
people. If this is the case, he said, the
cold war exists because of the ‘two
countries’ inability to understand
each other.

The way language is used in both
the Soviet and American press is
partly responsible for creating this
“evil empire” stereotype, Thomas
Kane, chairman of Pitt’s communi-
cations department, said.

The practice of putting prisoners
to work in the U.S. is called prison
industry; when it occurs in the
Soviet Union, it is called slave labor.
This is one of several examples Kane
gave of double-standards in the
press. He added, however, that these
double-standards are not necessarily
intentional. “We all think we’re tell-
ing the truth,” he said.

“Americans have to realize the
majority of people in the U.S.S.R.
are not either barbarians or poten-
tial defectors,” he said.

Tim Moersh/ The Pitt News

Dr. Peter Safar was one of
four Pitt professors who
spoke Monday at an anti-

war conference in Oakland.

Western Europeans, unlike
Americans, are able to see this,
according to Molly Rush, director
of ‘ the Thomas Merton Center.
Western Europeans, because of their
proximity to the Soviet Bloc coun-
tries, are not as bogged down with
Soviet stereotypes as the people of
the U.S. _

Unfortunately, she said, the peace
movements in Western Europe are
largely ignored by the press. She
added that it will be up to the citizens
of the two superpowers to make
their governments move toward
detente.

‘Americans have to
realize the majority of
people in the U.S.S.R.
are not either barbar-
ians or potential
defectors.’

—— Thomas Kane

Teresa Wilson, vice president of
the local Peace Links: Women
Against Nuclear War and organizer
of the workshop,» said that her
organization's primary goal is to
build links between other peace
organizations and interested women
in order to find them a place in the

peace movement in which they can

work and feel comfortable.

Cottam said he sees President
Ronald Reagan as one of the worst
offenders in this respect. Reagan
sees activists as either well-meaning,
naive dupes of the U.S.S.R. or trai-

tors, he said. Cottam added that
Reagan would never consider the
possibility that the U.S.S.R. might
desire a stable world without nuclear
confrontation.

Cottam was also pessimistic
about the democratic candidates
running against Reagan for presi-
dent. The only candidate remaining
with any new ideas in dealing with

the arms race, Jesse Jackson, isn’t '

getting any support, he said.

‘I «\ M‘, 3.1”?


Group returns from Nicaragua

By Bob Steen
The Pitt News

An ecumenical group of local
Christians returned from a week-
long visit in Nicaragua voicing
approval for the revolutionary San-
dinista government’s policies in a
news conference held Monday at
Trinity Episcopal Cathedral
downtown.

Members of the group fear that
U.S. efforts to derail Nicaragua's
economic recovery —— actions the
group considers immoral and illegal
— will be successful.

According to group coordinator
Betty Voigt, a student at the Pitts-
burgh Theological Seminary, I8
Pittsburghers joined the I56 Ameri-
cans from 31 states who have
already gone to Nicaragua as part of
the Witness to Peace program. They
returned Friday.

The program’s purpose, Voigt
said, is threefold: “to be a non-
violent presence of U.S. citizens
standing with Nicaraguans in their
suffering caused by U.S.-supported
‘contras,’ to develop an understand-
ing of the Nicaraguan situation and
to return to raise people’s conscious-
ness about our U.S. foreign policy in
Nicaragua.”

In I979, a popular socialist revo-
lution led by the Sandinistas threw
out the regime of longtime dictator
Anastasia Somoza Debayle. Since
then, an army of Nicaraguan
counter-revolutionaries, financed
and encouraged by the CIA, has
tried to overthrow the Sandinista
government, invading the country

on several occasions from bases In
Honduras and Costa Rica.
Group members gave reports that

may contradict the assumptions of”

more distant observers.

Father John O’Mallev. Pastor at
St. Mary’s Rectory in Lawrence-
ville, expected to see more hungry
people but found that everybody
was being rationed food.

He fears, though, that this might
not continue.

“They don’t have much time for
American policy to change,” he said.
“They’re being beat economically.”

Sister Maria Snowden of Carlow
College said she expected to see a
defensive attitude toward
Americans.

“No one was hostile to us,” she
said and suggested that this was
because the Nicaraguans she met
had become used to seeing Ameri-
cans from the Witness to Peace
Program. -

Snowden called the U.S. policy of
trying to undermine the government
“insidious.”

When asked if this policy would
force Nicaragua to look to Cuba and
the Soviet Union for help, she said,
“They honestly need help from any

..country and are in a position to ask

for that help.”

The day after their arrival ' in
Managua, the capital of Nicaragua,
the group travelled about four hours
to Ocotal, according to group
member Barbara Murock, who
works at the Hunger Action Coali-
tion in Oakland.

The town is near the Honduran
border and has been hit by counter-
revolutionary (contra) attacks.

manent American presence tnere to
deter further attacks, she explained.

In Ocotal, the Pittsburghers were
guided by Witness to Peace partici-
pants staying there on a long-term
basis. The visitors stayed in the
homes of local residents.

Among the Nicaraguans to whom
some group members spoke were 90
people who had been kidnapped by
the “contras.” Sixty others had not
yet returned, Murock said.

Group leader Art McDonald said
the contras had apparently kid-
napped them to indoctrinate them
and to develop sympathy for a
counter-revolution.

, “It was very clear that they wanted
the sons to fight for them,” said
McDonald.

Carol Shraeder, 23, and the
youngest member of the group, was
shocked at first by the poverty she
saw in Ocotal. But witnessing the
strength ofthe people and their hope
changed her mind, she said.

“Their houses were very simple,
but the people seemed very satisfied
with what they had,” she said.

And though the people live in the
midst of fighting, “the death around
them didn’t seem to consume them,”
Shraeder said.

Participation in a mass, a meeting
with local militiamen, a festival and
a visit to a local progressive day care
center were also on the Ocotal itiner-
ary, Murock said.

The group spent the last three
days in Managua, where they visited
two of the country’s three newspap-
ers, La Prenza, the opposition
paper, and Nuevo Diario, the
government paper.

Elections Committee wants power

Adviser selection questioned

By Colette Fenis
The Pitt News

The Election Committee of the
Student Government passed a reso-
lution at Monday’s meeting to take
the power of choosing a student
government adviser from the hands
of the Student Activities Office and
put it into those of student
government.

The committee voted 6-0, with
one abstention, for the Student
Activities Office to relinquish that
power to the Student Government
Board and its six standing
committees.

The committee’s resolutions
focused on the ad ministration’s role
in Student Government Board elec-
tions and expressed concern that
because the adviser is appointed, the
administration could also have some
vested interest in the outcome of the
elections.

Current board president Ken
Stram declined to comment on the
resolutions until they are officially
brought before the full board.

Election Committee chairman
Jim Brady said the committee is not
asking for the replacement of cur-
rent adviser Joyce Giangarlo.

“Student government should have
the power to chose its own adviser,”
Brady said.

Committee member Mike Joa-

‘Studem Governmem
should have the power
to choose its own
adviser.’

—— Jim Brady

-:————E
i

now. the lone abstention, said he
believed such a resolution was not
within the committees jurisdiction.

Committee member Chuck Pas-
cal said that in order for the other
student government standing com-
mittees to be able to select a student
goverment adviser, the Student
Government Board must vote to
pass this resolution.

The following resolutions will
also be brought before the board at
Thursdays board meeting:

0 One asking that the chairman of
each standing committee have a vote
in the adviser selection. Pascal said
passage of this resolution will assure
that the board does not have a
monopoly on the adviser selection.

0 One stating that the Election
Committee should preside on the
Student Government Judical Board
until sucha boardis appointed. The
board is currently without a sitting
judicial board although the board
was scheduled tg appoint one last
January.

Board member Dave Pikovsky

said the reason the Student Govern-
ment Judical Board has not been
appointed is that the restructuring of
the judical board isi,not completed.
Efforts, he said. are underway to
promote more member interest in
the year-round activities ofthejudi—
cial board, rather than the most
important activities centered around
election time.

In other business, the Election
Committee said it wanted to amend
items in the elections code.

One committee proposal, which
drew the attention of several board
members, was the proposal to place
restrictions on future Student
Government Board candidates.
Anyone wishing to run for the board
would have to serve at least one term
on a student government standing
committee, Pascal said.

With this type of restriction, Pas-

_ cal said, the committees will be

strengthened and the board will
benefit because new members will
not have to take time out to familiar-
ize themselves with the governmen-
tal processes.

“Don‘t you think that’s a little
strict?” Joanow asked the commit-
tee. “It seems like we will be breeding
candidates.”

Board member Betsy Fitzpatrick
said “the purpose of strenghtening
the committees is just fine” but
added that there ought to be a differ-
ent way to do it without going
through the election process.

Stockwell said the subcommit-
tee members were uninformed
about, inexperienced with and
even unaware of the location of
countries such as Angola.

On. the CIA’s actions in the
United States, Stockwell said,
“Everything they [the CIA] do is
illegal, everywhere they are."

Stockwell said that the agency
had spent over 20 years testing
drugs and viruses on American
citizens.

“They dragged a barge
through San Fransico Bay ~
disseminating a virus — so they
could see if it was a viable way of
destabilizing a city.”

He said that in comparison to
other world terrorist organiza-
tions, the CIA ranks as the larg-
est in scope and activity.

State schools get new chancellor

James McCormick was appointed to a three—year term as
chancellor of Pennsylvania’s l4 state-owned universities re-
cently. The 45-year-old McCormick has been serving as interim
chancellor since last July. Eugene Dixon, chairman of the
university system’s board of governors, said that a nationwide
search was conducted.

The new chancellor’s $70,000 per year salary is low when
compared to similar positions in other states, according to
Dixon. However, he said that the board did not want to exceed
Governor Thornburgh’s salary, which is $75,000.

Heart Association looks for help

The American Heart Association is looking for volunteers to
help with the many tasks that go into community service
throughout the country. With nearly two million people,
including tens of thousands of doctors and scientists, involved
in the organization, it is one of the largest and most respected‘
volunteer health agencies in the country.

The blood-pressure screening clinics conducted by the asso-
ciation and the Allegheny County Health Department attempt
to upgrade public awareness of the many problems connected
with high blood pressure. The program utilizes some 603

volunteer registered nurses, LPNs,EMTs, paramedics and lay
persons.

Before concluding his lecture,
Stockwell pointed out that
“there is hope. Even if there is a
one in a million chance to stop
this paranoia, we have to try.”

Cancer surgery: a hard decision

By Ron Smutny
The Pitt News

The decision of whether or not to

' operate on patients with cancer of

the head and neck region was the
topic of Dr. Eugene Myers’ discus-
sion at yesterday’s Ethics for Lunch
lecture entitled “The Moral Dilem-
mas of Radical Cancer Surgery.”

Myers, an eye, ear and throat spe-
cialist at Eye and -Ear Hospital and
professor at Pitt's School of Medi-
cine, told of the constant dilemma
surgeons face in deciding between
performing an operation to extend
the life of a patient or letting him die
of cancer. '

“The dilemma in such cases is
extremely difficult,” Myers said,
“since it involves patients with
severe difficulties in hearing, seeing,
smelling or swallowing.

“It is basically a question of qual-

' ity of life in the specific individual,"

he said. 

Most patients of Myers tend to be
heavy drinkers and smokers, which
are frequently characteristic cancer
patients, and elderly, depressed
people.

While these people may opt to
proceed with surgery, others may
wish to leave it alone or develop
their own therapeutic programs.

Myers said the self-help programs
are usually unsuccessful, and the

Q in the emotional

patient either dies or eventually ends
up having surgery. Therefore, he
generally views surgery as the best
route to follow from the beginning
when dealing with head and neck
cancers.

Myers explained that having
surgery is a very difficult and emo-
tional choice for most patients to
make.

“I don‘t get personally caught up
end of the
dilemma, Myers sid, “because if
you do that as a surgeon,’ you’re
lost.”

Myers said he explains both sides
of the dilemma in layman’s terms
and allows the patient to make the
choice, although many are so upset
they are unable to understanding the
options.

Because most cancer patients
have great difficulties in making the
choice by themselves, Myersstresses
the importance of family
involvement.

“It is very important to include the
patient’s family members or signifi-
cant others so they may hear the

99

“information and reinforce the ideas

in the patient,” Myers said. Should
the patient agree to surgery, “the
family must understand from the
beginning that the patient is not
going to be quite the same [in
appearance or functio‘n],” he said.
After the options have been
explained to the patient and under-
stood by everyone involved, Myers

said most of his patients eventually
respond to the dilemma with,
“You're the doctor; do what you’ve
got to do."

Artists at Eye and Ear Hospital
can design and sculpt prgsthetic
facial parfs fof’ features that hav'é
been disfigured by the cancer or the
surgery, Myers said. Although such
reconstruction may not restore a
face to its original appearance, it will
permit functional movement of the

I patient’s face, which may not have

been otherwise possible, he said.

“The basic dilemma is whether the
patient is willing to take the chance,”
said Myers. Depending on the
patient’s age and overall quality of
life, he believes surgery is usually
very worthwhile.

“It requires experience and intui-
tion to judge,” Myers said, “espe-
cially when operating may interfere
with another bodily function.”

Dr. Peter Machamer,.a Pitt pro-
fessor of history and philosphy of
science, believes the broad question
regarding this type of surgery is,
“Under what circumstances can you
judge a certain person’s quality of
life to have them go through such an
operation?”

“The surgeon and the patient
must consider all of the factors
involved, such as family, length of
the illness and the prospect for re-
covery,” he said, “before making

such a major decision.”

Class helps
patients with
cancer cope

B N P ki
Thye Piﬁnlflzeyws op ' n

The Presbyterian-U niversity Hos-
pital and the American Cancer
Society are sponsoring an “I Can
Cope” class for cancer patients and
their families.

“Education is the key word,” pro-
gram facilitator Kathy Conrad,
R.N., said. There are other groups in
the city that concentrate on support
for both patients and their families
but not on education, Conrad said.

The object of “I Can Cope” is to
educate patients about anatomy,
medical terminology, treatment,
daily health care, side effects of
cancer treatment, basic exercises,
relaxation techniques, local resour-
ces and what patients can do to care
for themselves, Conrad explained.
The facilitators stress that cancer is a
chronic disease like diabetes, not a
death -sentence, Conrad said.

“We don’t hear about the person
who lives a full life with cancer,"
Conrad said. “Too frequently, we
hear about the person who dies."

ln the class, patients learn that
there are over 50 different drugs
alone that can aid treatment of
cancer at home. The eight classes
feature speakers, often physicians.
who answer the patients‘ questions
in an informal setting.

Most of the patients find they
learn things they didn’t know before
they attended the class, Conrad said.
For instance, they may learn of
technique that could be useful in
their own cancer treatment.

About half of the patients attend-
ing the class are /newly diagnosed
patients. The other half have been
undergoing cancer treatment for a
year or two. Most heard about the
program through physicians or the
media, Conrad said.

Her class has about I2 patients,
but hospitals that have been running

-Gk)?‘

GB‘

.1‘

“I Can Cope” for a long time can 6

attract as many as 30 patients forﬁ

each class, she said.

The goal of the American Cancer
Society is to always have an “I Can
Cope“ class running in at least one of
the city‘s hospitals. Conrad‘s class
began in February and will run until

- April 12-.»

KEEPING
IN STEP

By PAUL GUGGINA

Pi tt’s Mary Ungar
makes her move
as choreographer
of Flashdancers

There's a new team in
town, one which this city
has been anxiously await-
ing. Thus far, it appears that
the Flashdancers, Pitts-
burgh's first and only pro-
fessional cheerleadihg
squad. have been well
worth the wait.

Under the direction and
supervision of Pitt junior
Mary Ungar, choreographer
of the Flashdancers, the
squad has filled an empty
spot in the hearts of
deprived Pittsburgh foot-
ball fans. But the Flash-
dancers are more than just
stunning thinclads.

“The type of dancing
they're doing is a very diffi-
cult technique," said Ungar.
“That's what I wanted to

make it. It's ‘flashdancing,’
but it's more of a jazz-type
technique. lt’s more diffi-
cult. I think, than the danc-
ing you see on “Solid Gold,”
but it's along that line. It's
not pom-pon stuff at all.
That's what we wanted to
get away from, to be
different."

Ungar was just looking for
a summer job when she
heard that the Pittsburgh
Maulers were forming a
cheerleading squad and
needed a choreographer.

“l went down and met
with lMaulers' Marketing
Director] Tim Pearson and
talked to him, and about
two weeks later, he called
me and asked for a
resume," said Ungar. “So I
threw one together and
then went for an audition,

where I made a routine for

them, and the next day I got

a call. I was just thrilled.”
Dancing has played a

large part of Ungar’s life‘

from her first lessons at age
four to her experiences as a
Golden Girl at Pitt. Even in
high school, she choreo-
graphed the routines for the
school musicals and origi-
nated the routines for the
cheerleaders, majorettes
and drill team.

Now with the Flash-
dancers, the 20-year-old
Ungar finds herself bogged
down by the work. “lt's fun,
but it really is a lot of hard
work,” she said. Ungar’s
duties range from design-
ing the Flashdancers’ uni-
forms, choreographing
their routines and line-ups,

Keeping up with a rigor-

more-than-full-time job with
the Flashdancers requires
a lot of time and effort.

“I'm either at work, or I'm
at work," she jokes.

But Ungar manages to
stay in control of her multi-
faceted life. “School is not
going to fall for me because
I won't let it fall. My priority is
being the best at what I do,
no matter what I do, no mat-
ter how many tasks I take
on. I want to do them all
well. I wouldn't sacrifice
one thing for the other," she
said.

“It all boils down to what

you are. You can't think
you're a hotshot and do one
thing and then neglect
everything else. That
makes you worse than you
were to begin with."

By MARK A. SINDLER

when the United States Football League

' awarded Pittsburgh one of its six expansion-

ary franchises last April, Ida D’Errico imme-
diately dreamed of cheerleaders. In time, this

. exercise in novel thinking became victim of

procrastination.

But with opening day under two months
away and the city folk quietly adjusting to the
team's selection of nicknames, D'Errico and a
23-judge panel conducted tryouts for 350
aspiring cheerleaders. when the music and
whirlwind dancing ended three days later at
Greentree’s Holiday Inn, 25 hopefuls became
members of the Flashdancers —— the city's first
professional cheerleading troupe.

The choreographer of the group and three
members are past or present members of
either Pitt's cheerleading squad or Golden Girl
81am0UT 8F0UP- D’Errico, as director of the

"Flashdancers. made sure of that after contact-
ing each USFL team.

She inquired, listened,. improved. The pro-
duct stands as a monument to dance ability;
each girl has about 12 years of dance expe-
rience under her Danskins.

“The routines are different from what most I

cheerleaders do,” D‘Errico said. “We prefer to
be referred to as a dance squad or dance-
cheerleading squad. These girls do dances
very similar to those on ‘Solid Gold.’ Very tech-
nical, very difficult.”

“Again, it is a talented dance troupe with a
classy aspect,” rather than what most people
think a dance line might be, said Mary Ungar, a
Pitt Golden Girl who choreographs the
Flashdancers. ,

“The Flashdancers. much to the surprise of
the people in the corporation, they are going to
be a great asset to the operation here. They'll
prove themselves through their talent.” I

Now a senior and finished with_Golden Girl
performances, ‘Roxanne Romah is moving
her act across the bridge from Pitt Stadium to
Three Rivers Stadium. V

A .22-year-old graduate of Keystone Oaks

. High School, Romah spent two yearsat Penn

State as part of “Touch of Blue” —_the Lions’
equivalent of the Golden Girls —— before
transferring. - - -

“After eight years of performing for football, I
thought it was all over,” ‘Romah remarked.
“But I saw this and thought what a perfect
opportunity it was.

-“We're individual dancers, not cheerleaders. y

We twirled and danced as Golden Girls. That
was college. This is professional."

Credit that in large part to D'Errico and to
Ungar, as well. After debuting before crowds
totaling 50,000 at Century III Mall in January,
the Flashdancers made their first official
appearance in Three Rivers on March 11,
when the Maulers hosted the Birmingham
Stallions. .

The halftime themes change with each
game. At the home opener, the Flashdancers

I hby TIM M“ SH

paid tribute to “Flashdance.” Last Saturday's
halftime performance saluted Grammy-
winner Michael Jackson and featured steps
from “Beat It," “Thriller” and “Wanna Be Start-
ing Something.’‘ '

Salutes down the line include themes
devoted to Broadway — with routines from
“Chorus Line,” “Cats" and “New York. New
York” —— and to “Raindrops Keep Falling On My
Head" and Gene Kelly's “Singing In The Rain."

Ideas for the themes will continue as the;
season progresses. The details of those ideas,"
however, will not and have not been as easy
to come by. The Flashdancers differ from
other statuesque pom-pon shakers —- who
make it on their sensuous looks — they must_
combine attractiveness with intellectual
awareness.

“The learning experience is strenuous. both '

mentally and physically," said Dawn Tomko,
a freshman Golden Girl. “It has to be. I want to
carry on my career as a dancer. If I didn’tthink
it was worth it, I wouldn't do it." -

“I used to learn five routines in one day,"
Romah said. “You get used to the fast stuff.
There are sacrifices. It’s hard. I haven't had
much of a social life since practices started. I'm
taking 18 credits and haven't had a date since
the term started." .

Ungar, a junior at ‘Pitt, sets her aspirationsto
attend law school aside. when choosing the
cheerleaders, she searched for devoted girls
like Tomko and Romah. The Flashdancers'
gigs on the Three Rivers’ turf are just 20 per-
cent of their responsibilities. Autograph ses-
sions and endorsement engagements
consume much of their time off the field.

“The girls are of a special breed, or they
wouldn't be here,” Ungar said. “They're pretty
and talented and everything, and when you
get high quality, then there's always competi--
tion involved. I think their personalities click.
Everybody’s on the same level, in the same
boat." . '

For all the work thafsinvolved —— from three- 3

hour practices three days a week in the pre-
season to four and five days a week
nowadays —— there is a mixed consensus on
the status aspect of being a Flashdancer. that

of being officially associated with a profes- .

sional sports team. ,

“You don't get used to it,” Churchill High
School senior Julie Contich said. “When we
were at Eastland Mall (Feb. 24], they were hav-

ing audio-visual problems, so we ended up

sitting at a table signing autographs. I

“I must’ve signed 250 in an hour. You don't
know why you feel so important. I don't think I
could do it if I didn't have the experience of
being a Chargette [Churchill's cheerleaders]."

“They wouldn't be here unless they thought .

it was a position of status," Ungar piped in.
“Prestige. The glamour, glitter and
excitement."

“My priority is being the best
at what I do, no matter what
I do, no matter how many
tasks I take on.” '

Many words can be written to
describe the l983—84 Panther
basketball season. Instead The
Pitt News sports staff has
decided to let the players and
coaches tell the story in the fol-
lowing pages through pictures
and quotes.

Billy Culbertson on Notre
Dame and Lasalle NIT games:

“We depended on the crowd
to ﬁre us up. We always were
charged up and played well in
the beginning, but when we got
into the real game, it wasn’t the
same. There were too many
letdowns.

"We were at home, and we
have expected a pretty good
game, but we didn ‘I play as hard.
On the road, we depended on
ourselves to get ﬁred up, and we
played hard. ‘

“I didn 'tfeel let down. [played
well, but I was sitting for too
long.

“Tonight, we played as hard as
we could, and then we just
played harder. Some of us were

sucking air, but when it got _ _
mugh, we came back" A deyected Panther bench watches the seconds tick off towards a loss to Boston College.

Unified netters defeat l(lP

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

Harmony is important in any
sport, including collegiate tennis.
The Panther tennis team has found
some of it, and the results are show-
ing. Pitt defeated Indiana University
of Pennsylvania 5-1 in a rain-
shortened match yesterday at
Indiana.

Pitt has a modest two-match win-
ning streak — over teams that
defeated the Panthers last season -
going into today’s meeting with St.
Vincent at Trees Courts.

“I’m real happy with the winning
streak," Coach George Dieffenbach
said. “We reversed the scores from
last year." _

One of the reasons for the turna-

bout is the number of newcomers in
the starting six positions this year.
Only Larry Lederer returned from
last year‘s squad.

“lt’s significant that with four
freshmen and a transfer, we are still
winning,” Dieffenbach said. “It's
natural that team unity has been
developing.

“The freshmen have to buckle
down on their studies and budget
their time well. Sometimes, upper-
classmen can waste time and get
away with it."

This new-found togetherness can
translate into mental toughness on
the court. Both Lederer, Jack Kalla
and Rich Monteleone had to over-
come deficits and an oncoming
storm to win their matches.

Lederer, the senior team captain,
won a service break in defeating
Tony Nedvetz 6-4, 6-4 in No. 2 sin-

gles. and Monteleone dropped the
first set before overcoming Jim Tay-
lor 3-6, 6-4. 6-3. Kaila was down 5-2
in the first set. but he reeled off five
straight games in beating Paul
Smith 7-5. 6-l in No.4 singles.

The Panthers needed to win five
singles matches in order to secure
the victory; rain washed out the dou-
bles competition.

Pitt is in the middle of a seven-
consecutive-match schedule. includ-
ing a visit to Eastern power West
Virginia tomdorrow.

“Having this many matches is
good,” Dieffenbach said. “It makes
the guys concentrate and work on

different things.”

Dieffenbach said he would like to
see the winning streak up to three.

‘‘I’d like to be 4-4 going into the
West Virginia match."

Pitt returns north with win

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

Two players stood out for the Pitt

baseball team as it returned from ,

last week’s trip to Florida.

Pitcher Aaron Krause threw two
impressive games, thesecond a com-
plete game - a I2-Strikeout perfor-
mance in a 10-6 win over Florida

A&M last Friday, giving the Panth— I

ers their first win of the season after
four straight losses. '

“He had a strong outing,” head
coach Bobby Lewis said. “It was a
happy sight to see him throw around
the plate, especially with the number
of walks we had the previous game.”

Lewis is also pleased with the hit-

ting of first baseman Tom Horew. '

Horew went 2-2 against the Rattlers
on Friday to go along with his per-
fect four—hit game in the first Florida
A&M contest. ‘

“He had a good series," Lewis
said. N

The final game of the two-game
set against Florida A&M was
marred with numerous errors. The
Panthers committed seven m-iscues;
the Rattlers had six. '

“The field was just put in,” Lewis
said, “and the creases didn’t fill in.
When the ball hit thesecreases, there
wasn’t a true bounce. You didn’t
know if the ball would bounce high
or low.” .

The squad also played fairly well
at spots during the five-game tour,
which also included Florida State.

Big men rule in Final Four

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News

Standing as tall as the spaceneedle
and stretching as wide as the King-
dome, the NCAA Championship
Tournament rolls into Seattle this
weekend carrying three packages of
basketball explosives and one spark.

Ge'o?g’etown, Kentucky and
Houston, each packing the power of
at least one seven-foot center, will go
to the big dance with everyone’s
dateless sister — Virginia — with the
hope of coming away with the
championship.

The Cavaliers might have been
better suited to mix elbows with the
three other competitors last season,
when 7-4 Ralph Sampson roamed
the Virginia middle. But Ralph has
since matriculated to the profes-
sional ranks, where some think
Hoya Patrick Ewing and Houston's
Akeem Olajuwon belong.

Even sans Sampson, the Final
Four promises to be a showcase of
stay-outta-my-face basketball, most
of which figures to be played well
above the rim. The romanticism of
seeing Ray Meyer’s DePaul team
send the coach home with a cham-
pionship ring or the fantasy of Day-
ton’s one-on-one savior, Roosevelt
Chapman, cutting down the King-
dome nets have given in to the reality
of the sport.

Basketball has steadily become
the domain of the big men — the
seven-foot centers who no longer
stumble down the court as in the
days of pioneer George Mikan.
Today’s center brings with him more

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 28, (1984

 

NCAA
Final
Four

than the lone offensive assault of a

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Wilt
Chamberlain. Today's giants are a
new breed, and this weekend’s festiv-
ities in Seattle promise the best of
the bunch, with Ewing and “The
Dream" and Kentucky’s double-
fudge duo, Sam Bowie and Melvin
Turpin.

Sure, there will be others who will
have impact on the games. Mon-
day’s championship could easily
come down to the foul shooting of
Virginia’s little Smurf, Ricky
Stokes, but the show will ultimately
belong to the big guys, those four
soul-shakers who could turn the
proceedings into one prolonged
argument for raising the goal
beyond the current 10 feet.

Each displays his own style of
control and can help his team in a
way not possible by the other.»
Whereas Ewing would rather snarl
and stare his way into the opposi-
tion‘s worst nightmare, Akeem will
smile softly while slamming home
points 29 and 30. .

Bowie, the most talked-about
non-participant of the last three

NCAA seasons, comes in as the rela-
tive rookie with everything to prove
against Ewing and Olajuwon, both
of whom have applied for residency
in the Final Four.

Bowie has risen from the bench to
which successive leg injuries rele-
gated him, but even greater transfor-
mation has occurred with the others.
Ewing and Olajuwon have meshed
their skills to become complete bas-
ketball players, leaving behind them
the flashes of brilliance and the pains
of inexperience.

This will be Ewing and Olajuwon
at their best; their offenses having
finally caught up with their shot
blocking and all-around menacing
prowesses on defense. The two had
been scheduled to meet in the early
season, but a series ofevents, includ-
ing the death of Ewing’s mother,
caused both head coaches, George-
town’s John Thompson and Hous-
ton’s Guy Lewis, to decide against
the idea.

That decision only serves to make
a prospective clash between the two
super centers all the more attractive
—— two men who have lifted the sport
of basketball to a level of physical
proficiency and power that has left
purists wanting for a two-handed set
shot and the innovators at a loss for
words.

Ironically, neither Ewing, a native
of Jamaica, or Olajuwon, born and
raised in Nigeria, took his first tra-
velling call on this land. Dr. Nais-
mith would be proud to know that
his game of baskets and backboards
has crept into the third world only to
emerge a ghost of its original self.

The “faze job” has been given a
new twist, and the Final Four will be
the perfect place to check it out.

Although he faced many problems during the 1983-
84 season, head coach Roy Chipman points towards
a brighter future next season. With returning star-
ters Keith Armstrong, George Allen and Andre Wil-
liams, along with talented underclassmen like Curtis
Aiken, Marlon Ferguson, Charles Smith and Junie
Lewis, Pitt may achieve a higher finish in the Big
