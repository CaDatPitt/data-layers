A PLAN T FOR

Student Assernbly Hall is_ Need-

ed Badly at This Time to Pro-.

mote Interest in Activities.

STUDENTS COULD RAISE THE MONEY

U Great Chanciewis Offered to Do

The Institution Lasting Good.

The time is fast approaching when
the absolute demand for a congregat-

ing place for the student body will be I

a necessity, which cannot be denied.
Just now in the history of this‘insti—
tution the future of the University
seems to depend entirely on the ef-
forts. of the alumni and administra-
tive .officers,_ who are courageously
labori'ng~to secure funds for our ex-
pansion. That they are succeeding
is well attested by the fact that build-
ings are no more mere idle fancies,
pbute actualities which are daily in
evidence. The student assembly hall
should not be erected through the en-
d_eavor of these men who are valiant-
ly aspiring to give the University the
best there is. i\luch more effective,
much more significant is the sugges-
tion that the funds for this building
be raised solely by the students of
the University of Pittsburgh.
The result of such a plan could be
brought about by organizing the stu-
_dents into a regiment of one thou-
sand, each regiment to be subdivided
intoiworking units of ten me_n, who
would take upon‘ themselves the obli-
gationto raise one hundred dollars
apiece, each man receiving any
‘amount so the grand total would be
.one hundred." \/Vith a regiment of
student Workers so formed it would
' be a simple matter to raise one hun-
dred thousand dollars for the student
hall. In-a campaign of this character
_ should be understood that the
alumni. are not to be solicited for
funds, but ‘only the friends of‘ the
students. ' '

Such a building as has been sug-

gested.as a necessity could be used
for capand gown performances’, the
Forensic society, for Chapel and in
fact for general purposes. which are
considered student activities at the
present time

The extirerne Worth of this sugges-
tionis *really__worth careful considera-
tion of the students.‘ The Weekly
will be glad to‘ hear from the students
on this question, and to that_ end in-

. V vites the use of, these columns for a

special discussion of this matter in

-» the next ‘issue.

CHRISTMAS.

Christmas, the hope and joy of the
youngster; Christmas, the contented
and rejoicing time of the year for the
_ adult will be in our midst soon. The
" commemoration of the great holiday
means much to many people in this.
land; some celebrate in luxurious
method while others are happy in the
possession of a slight addition to.
theirinatural condition. ‘As year by
year passes, though, it seems the
American people are getting away
from.the true meaning of -_the day.
More and more the necessity presses
forward to purchase gifts for this per-
, son or that one; if the tokens are
‘ , ‘not bought, it appears as if the per--’
son so slighted will be offended. SQ__

it goes all down the line from the
richest to the poorest, striving to buy
gifts because the decree of fashion has

so ordered. Necessities in the home
are allowed to go uncared for, that
the present for Uncle John _or Aunt
Jane may not be forgotten. Each sea-
son the rush becomes greater; that in-
tangible something seems to drive
purse and reason out the same door,
The result of this folly is all too ap-
parent after the intoxication of the
Yuletide is over; funds that might
have been applied to many useful
sources are squandered and cannot be
brought back. The true essence of
joy at Christmas time is not received
through the medium of extravagant
expenditures, but by means of know-
ing that some person who is really in
need has been given comfort and

,\

 solace. A pound of coffee taken to‘
the door of the needy will accomplish!
—more good than all the glitter and
 tinsel of worthless holiday gifts that!
are soon consigned-to oblivion. If we 9
thought of the poor of our neighbor-
hoods and less of foolish desires to
win the affection of some remote
friend, the correct conception of
Christmas would be experienced.

I; When we are preparing for the com-
ing celebration, sight should not be
l_ost "of the men and women in the
shops and stores, who daily withstand
. the rush of the Christmas buyers.with
 a smile and endeavor to please. If
there is buying done, why not do it
early and give the multitudes of
workers" an opportunity to enjoy their
respite from labor when it comes.
When the iiewsboy comes Christmas

' -morning why not give him a smile

Our correspondents are quite coin-
plimentary this week. Nothing like
being to the point though. Of course
track meets are such vulgar things,
you know.

The steps to Penn Hall ,are enough
to make any well meaning student
wish the science of medicine was-
changed to the consideration of avia-
tion.

No reason why the Regiment of the
thousand couldn’t raise the hundred

building. Are you On?

December Meeting is Held at Home
of Miss Carhart.—Dinner to
be given.

The Collegiate Alumnae of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh held its regular
December meeting, in the absence of
the president, at the home of the vice
president, Miss Carhart. The ofﬁcers
elected for the year are, Miss Flor-
ence Carhart, president;‘Miss Stella
Stein, vice president; Miss India
Stephenson, provisional vice presi-
dent; Mrs. H. H. Fisher, secretary;’i
Miss Katherine Foster, treasurer.
Plans were completed for the annual
dinner of alumnae and girl students
of the university, to be held at the
Fort Pitt Hotel this month. Mrs. A.
B. Smith was appointed chairman of
the committee of arrangements for
the dinner. ’

WORK, EXPANDING.

Dr. Dyess, head of the History de-
partment, states that interest in the
various courses offered in history has
never been as great as at the present
time. The increase has been so great
in fact, that several electives for the
coming term will of necessity be
withdrawn. Additional instructors
are to be secured next year.

WEEKLY
OUR CQRRESPQNDENTS. , I

Elsewhere in these columns appear
two communications received last
week-from correspondents. Each one
of the articles sets forth an opinion
of two different matters discussed in
this paper. It is with a great deal
of reluctance that one of the letters
is reproduced here, but-, as it is the op-

‘posite side of an issue in which, we

are intensely interested the etiquette
of journalism has been temporarily
sidetracked to present the mind of one
of our readers. This very courageous
dissenter slipped the paper on which
his thoughts were written into the
mailbox of the \/Veekly with the com-

munication unsigned and absolutely»

without any means of identiﬁcation
Such action, to be sure, relieved us
from printing_the contents of the en-
velope, but, we are not ashamed to
express our convictions openly and
fairly before the student body with
our names appearing above the state-
ments. It is regretted that the author
did not sign his name; not for publica-
tion, but merely as an evidence of
good faith on his part. We commit
without any fear, as the writer sug-
gests, the whole matter to the simple
Statement, “judge for yourself.” An
anonymous communication, though,
cannot help be at, a disadvantage to
the man who appreciates the worth of
mental stamina. '

In regard to the other communica-
tion a little comment is necessary.
Our correspondent is wrong when lie
assumes he was personally insulted
by the intent 0'1‘ purpose of the article
in respect to "the Owl of l9ll. Very
candidly speaking, it is not our
purpose in editing this paper to insult
anyone; if we were on the board for
that intention, we would not merit the
attention of a single reader in this or
any other institution. Nor on the
.other"liand are we on the board to
make matters seem sweet when they
are decidedly otherwise. The criti-
cism, that the writer was subjected to
any personal‘ humiliation is, _tlierefoi'e,
dispelled. The ability of the_ men
mentioned by the correspondent is
not in the least underrated by the
opinion expressed in these columns
last week. Both the men in question
no doubt did much to aid the Uni-
versity during their career in the col-
lege and to them is given fiill credit
for their labors. It is, indeed, un-
fortunate, that such calibre should be
found in an organization whose prin-
cipal virtue lies. in its mythical in-

ception._The gentleman writing prob— :
ably forgets-that the track event held ;

each year is the biggest asset the
University of Pittsburgh has," as far

as the preparatory schools and tlie;

high schools of this section are con-
cerned. Every year the schools of
the immediate territory are invited to
come to Pittsburgh and participate in
the meet, which means the University
is placed very strongly before the
young mind. The significance of the

annual athletic meet, which IS under:

THE TREES GIFT.

The real importance of the Trees
gift to the University cannot be ap-
preciated at the first glance, because
the reality of" the present. has a tend-
ency to hold one in awe. Last week
the news seemed almost too good to
be true, but now that a week has
passed there appears to be safety in
observing the real beneﬁt to the in-
stitution this magniﬁcent donation
has conferred. Just at this time many
more buildings are needed to carry
on the work of the University; ex-

that the facilities at hand are now far

students each year. ‘
So. at ﬁrst glance it would appear
as if new class rooms and lecture
halls were in crying demand, yet, it is
not depreciating this need when it is
said that the new gymnasium will add
at least two hundred students to the
registrars list next September. The

by mere words. The ‘great impetus
‘to track athletics is one of the prin-
cipal features of the new training
facilities, hitherto sadly lacking in the
University. Now, however, the men

The. exceptional advantage in having
the gymnasium nearby for the foot-

not be estimated in idle conjecture.

“Our defeat may be attributed -to.

let us forget about "them and let it

will truthfully tell you that every

game of his life. It was a clean,
manly game from start to ﬁnish, so
let us give our western opponents the
credit that is justly due them. They
have a right to feel proud. Their sea-'

fact, the most successful in their
history. V\/'e give them credit.”

At the Georgetown University‘ ball

innovation which should prove popu-

Pittsburgh. The idea is to have a

the Georgetown contingent,'and to
designate the different tables with
pennants and ﬂags representing such
colleges as Notre Dame, Fordham,
Pittsburgh College. Yale, “ Princeton,

ence” In Latest Edition of
That Work.
A new edition of the authoritative

work, “American Men of Science,”
edited by Professor James McKeen

Cattell, of Columbia University, and ,

published by The Science Press,
shows the University of Pittsburgh
to rank well up with the leading Uni-
versities in the recognition of her
scientists. Five of the Deans of the
University are accorded _a.p1ace in
the book as follows: Bishop, of the
School of Engineering; Chambers, of
the School of Education; Fetterman,
of the School of Liberal Arts; Schles-
inger. of the School of Astronomy,‘
and VVadsworth, of the School of
Mines. The following professors alsol
come in for notice: Phillips, in;
Chemistry; Duncan, in Chemistry;
Smith, in Civil Engineering, and Drs.
Cohoe, Klotz, Guthrie and Sheldon

in departments of the School of
Medicine. This list is probably ‘not
'exhaustive. .

it is learned the football schedule will

is being raised‘ by alumni of the col-
lege in "this city to have the Maroon

some slight overtures have already

would unquestionably make Penn;
State look to her laurels, if the two‘
colleges met on the gridiron. Prince-

ton was only able to down the

Eastonians by three -points this fall,

which is some slight crit_erion of their

ability on the lined ﬁeld.

' It is earnestly hoped the ‘rumor

may be a reality before long, as both

Pittsburgh and Lafayette are in the

same class with Penn State, making

it possible to have the three elevens

in a contest -for State supremacy

PITT Is INVITED TO SEND

TEAM TO _GEoRGETowN.

Not Likely Track Men Will Accept
Invitation Owing to Improper
Training Quarters.

.Graduate Manager, L. B. Hurst,
stated lastevweek an invitation had
been -received from Georgetown Uni-
versity authorities to send a team to

' the annual indoor meet at Washing-

ton, D; C., March 4, 1911. It is not
likely the team willk be sent, as the
track men are not in training during
the winter months, and would, there-
fore,';not be able to make a creditable
showing in the Cap-itol City.

—'M/hen the new gymiiasium, donated

I by .Mr. Trees is "completed, it is the
aim of Coach Thompson to have the_
‘ track team out during the entire year,

making it possible to_ have represent-'
atives in‘ all the winter indoor meets

held throughout the ‘country.

EXAMINATIONS THIS WEEK.

Examinations are being given for
the fall term this week in all schools.
The tests are final in character and
alongwith the class work go to form

_ the term grade of the student. The last

two hours of-recitation work, accord-
ing to the new plan of examinations, is
being devoted to=quiz._ The plan was
rather sharply» criticised in the Week-
ly last week and it remains to be seen
‘whether or not it is successful. The
consensus of opinion is somewhat

against the method .as it involves too ~

much labor at one time. 4 ~

 ::To the Editor of the_Pitt Weekly:

In your issue of December 7, you

jtakeloccasion. to ridicule the editors

of the 1911 Owl, and to insult me per-
sonally. ’This causes me no surprise,
since it is consistent with your editor-
ial policy to~satirize‘ worthy objects

-, A . to curry favor with a certain class of
' - students.

' By the reference to the Billiken

 [Club as the,“Bunco Club,” you have
 insulted Mr. George M. P. Baird, a.

man who, during his entire college
life has given his best efforts to the

college ' hymns and
songs, and that he was Editor of the
1909 Owl, and twice Editor of the

A Courant, of which you are doubtless,
unaware. You also include Mr. Carl! faithfully.

versity faculty. 1

I need merely mention,
' that Mr. Baird is the author of Drac-'

the average preparatory school, and
develop the power of the student to
depend upon himself for his success.
A rule which allows a student a cer-
tain number of absences and no
more, with a flunking penalty at-
tached, is nothing but a mechanical
operation, taking account of no ele-
ment but that of time. As scholar-
ship, and not time, is the all import-
ant factor to be considered, it is evi-
dent that such a rule is palpably in-
efficient. A student who is able to
maintain a high grade of scholarship

in spite of repeated absence‘, is en-,
titled to credit for his ability, andi

under the new system an instructor
cannot rightfully withhold it from
him. A ~ student whose scholarship
is poor, evidently cannot afford

many cuts. The old rule was a blind,

Last VVednesclay morning thel The University had as a guest off

chapel speaker was Dr.‘_l. Leonard i.

Levy, an eminent ﬁgure in the life of

Pittsburgh. The topic chosen for the
talk was“ “Thomas Carlyle, the
Prophet." Probably no speaker for

some time, has so held the attention

of the students as Doctor Levy did
last week. The address was not only
scholarly, but, most ﬁnely inter-
spersed with keen remarks that
could not but elicit praise from the
most exacting. After being intro"-
duced by— the _Chancellor, Doctor
Levy was greeted by a round of very
warm applause from the students.
Replying to the rather vociferous
greeting, the speaker said: “I would
much ‘rather have the applause at the
conclusion of the address.” Going on

"the speakerdeﬁnecl the three terms
' concerning the word “prophet,” ﬁrst,

the Latin meaning, to speak forth;
the Greek, to having the power of
forthtelling, and the Hebrew, imply-
ing fruiting. After a careful explana-
tion of_ the real use of the word‘
“prophet” it was shown how great

"modern men were entitled to recog— .
A nition as" prophets. Among those

named were Ruskin, Tennyson, Lin-
coln and the great Carlyle. .

' The early life of the’ author was
sketched with especial reference to
its effect upon his laterilife. The
hardihood of the Scotch race was
the extreme
narrowness of the author°s own home
was revealed with striking clarity.
The unhappy married life of Carlyle»
was cited as an example of still
furtherdisadvantages to the career of
the distinguished Scotchman. Dr.

‘ Levy paused long enough to indulge

in a few witty remarks‘ concerning
marital bliss and gained considerable
applause from’ the feminine conting-
ent present, when he said, “In spite of
this I believe in co-education.” Con-
tinuing, the years of Carlyle’s matur-
ity were revealed in their true im-
port; the wonderful capacity, the ex-
treme ability of the author was

dress all the sterling qualities of Car-
were summed up in rhetorical
array that was at once comprehensive
and masterful. .

Friday morning the students heard
with marked pleasure the address,’
“The Politics of Great Britain.” The
remarks were strongly emphasized,
and showed that the speaker knew
whereof he spoke. To summarize
very brieﬂy, the speech of Mr.
George contained the reasons for the
recent change of sentiment in the-
Empire; showed the wonderful power
of Lloyd-George, in the introduction
of the tax measures in the United
Kingdom and ‘the consequentresult
of the changed ideas of the people of
England. The entire talk was brim-
ful of wit and /clever sayings.

Mr. George is the son of the fam-
ous Daddy George, of George Junior
Republic fame. ’The University stu-
dents were fortunatein hearing such

man-elect from the

City of New

Case arid Western Reserve
Invitation to Play Hockey in
Cleveland.

The University athle‘tic authorities
have received a formal invitation from
both Case and Western Reserve col-
lege to play hockey in Cleveland this
winter. The inducements oﬁfered are
very strong, but it is hardly possible
that ‘the university will be able to
send a team, as the abandonment of
the Gardens has made it ‘practically
impossible to support a hockey team.
Such information has been conveyed
to the Ohio colleges who extended
the very kind invitations to the Uni-
versity.
