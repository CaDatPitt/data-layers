‘Coastal Defense’

Used As Armament

Boost, Hahn Says

By JERRY HAHN -
Regardless of the fact tliat.
the past niilitary appropria-
tions aren’t exhausted many
“citizens” still clamor‘ for more
agents of destruction on the
pretense of self-protection.
l:3ig navy advocates defend
additional arniainent on the
grounds that we must have a
larger navy to defend our shores
and “interests.” ' -

“To defend our shores” is as
lucid as “status quo,” that pet
phrase used by “statesmen” and
military leaders.

Taking the ﬁrst phrase literally,
without quibbling, militarists seem
to want ships to guard every foot
of coastline, which is a physical
impossibliity. We must consider
our advantageous geographical po-
sition beIOre.-awe begin to worry
about invasion.

The probability of war with
Canada, on the north and a do-
minion of Great Britain, is as like-
ly as President Roosevelt running
for a third term. On the south,
Mexico, although wary of us,
would not wage war zugainst us
independently.

(That leaves the Atlantic an:l Pa-
ciﬁc Oceans. The probability of
aggressive forces reaching our
shores in emcient orga.n.i.zation for
conquest is dubious, too.

Defend Our Shores?

We must remember that the
enemy must constantly replenish
their sundry supplies, especially
gasoline, as they progress nearer
the States. As the enemy gets
nearer our shores, she according-
ly greatens the distance between
her advancing columns and their
supplies base.

The more we think about the
argument “to defend our shores”
as used in defense of a larger
navy, the more absurd the propo-
sition becomes.

In reality the “big guns” in
Washington want a bigger
“brood” to protect “our interests.”

The Panay affair is agood ex-
ample of the navy’s deﬁnition of
“protecting our interests.” The
Panay was a gunboat protecting
property of the Standard Oil com-
pany. If we should want to carry
out such a policy as we attempted
in China, we must send many
more armaments over there. The
Panay, typical of our forces over
there, couldn’t protect itself let
alone “defend our interests.”

Protection of American citizens
and property is justiﬁable. How-
ever, if our government gives our
citizens ample warning to evacu-
ate a danger spot, as she did in
China, what damage happens after
should be allowed to pass by the
boards.

A parallel to “defending our in-
terests” in China, is likely to re-
cur in the Philippine islands,
which‘ are under our supervision
at present. Japanese nationals
have settled in the Philippines,
particularly in the section of Da-
vao. ;At present, their numbers
represents a mijority of the na-
tive population.

Big ‘Guns .

Geographically speaking, the
Philippines are on Japan’s door-
step. 1There is little doubt that if
the United States give the Phil-
ippines their independence, as
scheduled in 1946, imperialistic
Japan will scoop the island up,
defending their action as “an urg-
ent need for colonies.”

“Big Guns” cry in Washington
that We must rearm to save our
fa_ce if such a “coup d’etat” oc-
curs.

Therein lies the gist of “big
navy” argument: WE MUST
SAVE OUR FACE;” which is a
good case of false pride

If we retained our hold on the
Philippines and our neutrality was
threatened by the Mikado, I say
swallow false pride.

It is true we must maintain our
prestige, but we will not keep it
by backing out of a conﬂict with
the Japanese after we have bared
our teeth. _

However, if we release the Phil-
ippines as promised in 1946, we
WILL maintain our prestige by
averting the boiling point.

Again, “big guns” yell what
about our “interests” in the Phil-
ippines? When it comes to choos-
ing between war and peace, we
should overlook “interests,” as we
didn’t’ do in the WorldAWar and
stick _'to our own sphere‘ inﬂu-

Congratulations
To The President

THE NEWS, shaking‘ campus politicoes in
its prognostication of the SFA presidency
election, herewith reprints, in the light of fact,

not fancy, its editorial in Monday’s paper.
:2: -*z= 

r <_ pr.

The Pitt News pauses in its pace to offer
congratulations to John Downie, president of
the linivei-sit_v Student-Facult,v Association.
The Asseinhly deserves credit for a wise choice.

Dowiiie has been on canipus for three _veai's,
he is a. nieinber of Delta Tau Delta, he led the
:l'reshma.n dance. Downie is acquainted with
the llniveiisit_v, its educational purposes and
2ict.ivit.ies.

He will inherit the position that is the most
hig-hl_v respectecl, the most influential. on cam-
pus. He will step into the shoes left in the poli-
iicul clothes closet by E. Ernest Rose, Jr. He
will have iiiaiiy respoiisiliilities.

Ailioiig‘ Do\viiie's duties will be, as repre-
seiitative of the students. to niakc student
opinion and ::tudent policy kiiown and felt on
the uanipus. He will have to act. ::-is .‘ll’l. execii-
tivv-—witli uiidei~staiiding- and breadth of in-
sig'lit—in handing" out coinniittec duties.

He will he 1-esponsible for llll'l‘()(lllL?lllj_2' incin-
bers of the adiniiiistratioii to the 1,‘~lll(l€‘lll.S :-iiul
members of the student body to the adminis-
tration.

Ainong policy consideratioiis will be the
question of ASU and other liberal ;_>7.ro'Lips on
cainpus—the question of ifecognizing or reject-
ing them. That will attach itself to his office.

The question of an eiilarged Tuck Shop or
a Student Cafeteria or a Student Union build-
ing will belong to him. He will he called upon
to express liiinseli’ upon the status of athletics,

the status of prot'essoi-s, the status of -stliiea-;

tion at the liiiiversity.

He will find it ll63LfeSSal')’ to form and foi.'ini.i-
late policy. He will discover the differ-ei1«:e lie-
tween sincerity and practicality, between pos-
sibilities and aspii'-ations. He will ﬁnd many
who will try to force their opinions upon him,
and he must act or react :ic<:ordiiigl_v.

John Downie, BAZ’9, has the pl.'lll'lill')‘ position
of iinportance at the l'niversit_v. He is the
leader of the t~'lll(l(‘ilT..\‘.

Tuesday night the assembly elected him.

(Addenda: President Downie, in his exec-
utive capacity, has announced that he will
hand out committee appointments following
the submission of committee petitions. It
has been mentioned on campus that Downie
has already his candidates in mind, that his
selections will be spooned out of the political
gravy bowl.

But it will require much ability to ﬁnd stu-
dents who can vitalize the Welter of commit-
tees within SFA conﬁnes. We would never
be the ones to say that coalition loyalty, not
ability and capability, will be the basis of his
selections. )

A Sporting
Proposition

RDINARILY, an auuounceineiit of a

change in setup in the pliysical €Ll[l(‘,‘(ll7l0l’l

course at the llniversity would attract no great
:i.tt.en.tion or coininent.

(‘curses in pliysieal education are g'enei°ally
regarded as just a. sideshow in the educational
circus, a custoniai'_v (‘.()ll(‘0n1ll3llf liai'*dlv paid
more than passing attention in the drive to-
warcl “learning. ”

Altliougli it is not our purpose here to elab-
orate on the value of the pliysical aspect of
educatioii, it must he acki1owle(l,g'ed that. v-ritli.
the nervous strain and consequent. drain on
pliys.i«:a.l health l)i*oi1giit about by college
studies and activities, some active f()l"l’l1 of rec-
i-ezition and exercise must. be provided for a
inure bzilaiiced college existence.

At an urban univei'sit_v, with its li‘llSl'l(‘ifl ac-
tivities oii an even larger plane, and few oppor-
tunities for participation in activities by the
average student, this situation hecoines more
acute.

And at the Uiiiversity. Liiifortiiiazitely, the
physical education course, by its very unat'ti.-ac-
tive nature. has tended to be regarded as a
necessar_v evil, soinctliiiig one must walk up the
hill for twice a week. Many students have
even chosen ROTC rather than submit to the
present setup.

Therefore, we regard today ’s announcement,
which outlines a plan to substitute participa-
tion in intramural athletics for the old “gym”
system as a welcome step.

It should revive iiiterest in the long stereo-
typed physical education course at the Univer-
sity. It should provide students a wider oppor-
tunity to participate in athletics, of their own
choosing. And it should make the animal
mental’ controvetrsy, “Shall I take gym or
ROTC?" a little’ easier to decide.

Professor Traces
Political Trends

By Irving Kaufmann

In ‘the most recent book to come from the Uni-
versity Press, Dr. Russell J. Ferguson, associate
professor of history, traces the early political life
of this section.

“Early Western Pennsylvania Politics” covers a
half century from 1783 to 1823.

According to the author, who was discussing the
research for the book, his investigations showed that
as far as politics are concerned, “there hasn’t been
much change. The early politicians lacked the
completeness of organization, but the origins of
nearly all the political practices of the present day
were evident then.”

Explains Political Practices

Explaining some of these practices, Dr. Ferguson
pointed out that the “committees of correspondence
in each township and county were virtually the
germs of the township and county committees oi
the twentieth century.”

To dispel any belief that today’s political evils
are a modern phenomenon, Dr. Ferguson explained
that the early politicos rushed the aliens in, had
them naturalized and “voted them;” and that “at-
tempts to use the political agencies to improve per-
sonal economic and social position were  common
then as now.”

Summing up the political struggles of the early
days, in Western Pennsylvania, Dr. Ferguson ob-
served, “it is essentially the story of pioneer :Ea1"m-

-3rs engaged in political controversies with the :ner- T

chants and business men of the Federalist party.”

Dr. Ferguson obtained the idea for the book
from his experience in teaching a course on Amer-
ican political parties.

Covers Five Years

His research, which covered a period of ﬁve
years, led him to “live-wire” material, much of
which was previously unused or unknown. To ﬁnd
this material he traveled to Philadelphia, Harris-
burg, New York, Washington, D. C.,, and Washing-
ton, Pa., Franklin, Meadville, and Erie. He visited
many other towns and counties, in which he “didn’t
locate material of an important nature.”

Chief sources of information were newspaper
ﬁles, letters, and court records.

One piece of valuable material was found in Har-

‘risburg, in the records of the State Legislation dur-

ing l789 to 1800. This material is “valuable and
rare, since there is only one set of the complete
records that I know of,” Dr. Ferguson said.

Ed.itor’s Not¢:—There will be a complete re-
view of “Early Western Pennsylvania Politics” as
soon as the editor writes it.

Bob Benchley
Gives Outline

,Qi Education

May, as most seniors know, is
the month of reckoning. Within
a few short weeks, the Great
Evaluation of the worth of a col-
lege education will take place.
Robert Benchley, in his “The
Early Worm,” has outlined the
beneﬁts of a four-year course at
any institution of higher learning.
FRESHMAN YEAR:

1. Charlemagne either died or
was born or did something with
the Holy Roman Empire in 1800.

2. By placing one paper bag
inside another paper bag you can
carry home a milk—shake.

3. Powder rubbed on the chin
will take the place of a shave if
the room isn’t very light.

4. Almost anything you need
to know about a subject is in the
encyclopedia.

7. The chances are against ﬁll-
ing an inside straight.
SOPHOMORE YEAR:

1. Nine—tenths of the girls in
a girls’ college are not pretty.

2. You can sleep undetected in
a lecture course by resting the
head on the hand as if shading the
eyes.

3. You can get dressed much
quicker in the morning if you take
off your trousers and underdraw-
ers at once, leaving the latter in-
side the former.

JUNIOR YEAR:

1, All women are untrust-
worthy.

2. Eight hours’ sleep are not
necessary.

‘J
L).

A good way to keep your
trousers pressed is to hang them
from a bureau drawer.

4. Heraclitus believed that fire
was the basis of all life.

5. The chances are that you
will never fill an inside straight.

6. It is not necessarily effe.m-
mate to drink tea.
SENIOR YEAR:

1. Six hours’ sleep are not ne-
cessary.
2. Bicarbonate of soda taken

before retiring makes you feel
better the next day.

3. There is as yet no law de-
termining what constitutes tres-
pass in an airplane.

4. Theater 2 tickets may be
charged.
.3. Flowers may be charged.

6. May is the shortest month of
the year.

Racket . . .
By Racko1‘iF

Right has triumphed!

-After four long years of try-
ing, SFA enters its fifth year of
grace with a president, wonder of
wonders, whom the majority
elected. President John Downie
may have forgotten. his prepared
speech for the banquet, thereby
revealing his ‘lack of extempo—
raneous ability, but that doesn’t
make him the worst man SFA has
ever elected. At any rate, he
could always get a vote of con-
fidence.

What good that may do is still
in the t‘ar—oﬁf future. In my
opinion, ex—Boss Al Barr struck
what should have been the key-
note of SF‘A’s inaugural meeting
when he said:

BARR PERSPICACIOUS

“Well, you’ve got a liberal
group in here next year. You

really ought to go places.”

This bit of unconscious humor
revealed Barr with less than his
usual. perspicacity. In the first
place, SFA next year will be thor-
oughly controlled by the frater-
nities, who as they themselves
will admit, are not particularly
interested in progressive activi-
ties.

And then, Lea Goldstein (alias
Mary Smith), most consistent lib-
eral in this year’s group, will be
missing next year because of her
own despondent resignation. It
was significant that her impas-
sioned and startling plea for eat-
ing facilities in place of orna-
ments went unsupported in a
group of fraternty men whose
meals at the house breed no more
than half the dyspepsia of which
the Tuck Shop can boast.

MASS LETHARGY

It’s a meaningful commentary
upon American politics to point
out once again that the masses
don’t seem to give a damn about
themselves. There are at least
4,000 Pitt students for whom a
student cafeteria would be a Gift
from the Gods, yet they were not
even interested enough to get
themselves represented on the stu-
dent governing body in an effort
to do something about it. In fact,
3,000 of them didn’t even vote.

And, as long as that mass pres-
sure remains a dormant non-ex-
pressive element, students at the
University of Pittsburgh, like the
human race all over, will remain
unrepresented. / .

It is going to take a’photo-
.-grrapliic ﬁnish to determine the
winner of the all-point trophy.

Kappa Sigma, current leader,
is having “protest” trouble in
the present inushball league.
The .Dithridge Street tossers re-
cently defeated the Phi Grams
and the Theta Chi’s in mushball
contests and (so a little bird told
us) both losers are entering pro-
tests to Mr. Corley in regards to
the eligibility of the Kappa Sig
twirler.

However, the umpire in these
two contests have laughed off
these protests and it appears from
the present standpoint that Corley
will do likewise.

PILAMS LOSE

Bernie Cashdollar pitched his
third straight victory of the season
Tuesday as the Phi Delts decisive-
ly overwhelmed Pi Lambda Phi
16-1. Jack Sigmon and Eddie Sable
connected for the only two hits
against “Cash.” Lyons hit a home
run in the opening inning with
two aboard to give the Phi Delts an
early lead which they were able to
increase each inning. Jaife was
the losing pitcher for the PiLams.

Pilams suffered their second
straight loss the following night to
Ray Light and PiKA. ‘The score
was 10-2.

Delt Tau Delta defeated SAE
and PiKA during this past week.

League A protest trouble. Sig-
ma Alpha Mu has shown the best
pitcher in the league, Lew Mend-
MDIN.

In Monday’s issue complete data
on the All-Point trophy will be re-
leased.

DECISION UPHELD

Protesting has become quite the
thing in the intramural interfra-
fraternity competition.
osous objections to a decision were
raised by Phi Delta Theta when it
riled a complaint against its dis-
qualification in the sweepstakes
last Friday.

Drawn up in documentary form,
'-the protest was the handiwork of
1-H‘ Council President Charles
Wright and the Phi Delt athletic
chairman, Bill Angel. It was sub-
mitted to the Corley office and a
hearing was called.

Despite the logic of the argu-
ments and their apparent sound-
ness, the decision of the tribunal
upheld the decision of Endicott
Batchelder, who made the ﬁrst
ruling as a judge in the race.

Sitting on the committee were
Harvey Rooker, director of intra-
mural athletics; Robert Corley, as-
sistant to the dean of men; Endi-
cott Batchelder, Jack Kotler,
chairman of I-F athletics; and
John Cheffey, chairman of Spring

Figures Claim Pitt
Temple In Tomorrows Meet

 

ill Beat

By ‘BILL MAZEFSKY

Tomorrow the unbeaten Pitt
track team will be in Philadel-
phia to step out against. the
strong Temple squad that will
be out’ to send the Panthers
back to the smoky city on the
short. end of the ﬁnal score.

At the same tune the Pitt
News emerges from a lengthy
huddle involving scraps of paper,
sheafs of records. numerous pen-
cils, head rubbing, and cheek
stroking, and comes up with the
prediction that the ﬁnal score will
be 74 to 61 with Pitt on the long
end of the score. This prediction
involved no magic crystals or
screwy mirrors, but was the re-
sult of some basic reasoning.

SPRINT STRENGTH

Matching time for time and dis-
tance, places Pitt in the favorite’s
role. The accompanying box points ,
out the maximum and minimum
totals for each team; and avoid-
ing the highest or lowest potenti-
alities, we have based our ulti-
mate score on the probable results
in each event.

Of course Coach Olson’s trou-
bles are not quite over. Despite
all this mathematical precision
track meets are not yet settled on
past records. Anything can hap-
pen in these events-—and not only
can but usually does. So in spite
of the “News” prediction, the
Temple and Panther teams must
still go through the formality of
 track meet. _

Panther strength is still concen-
trated in the sprints and middle
distances. Captain Edgar Mason
and Frank Ohl are slated to finish
1-2 in the 100 and 220—yard dash-
es. Unless Movitch of Temple

tween these two, Pitt will garner
16 points from these events alone.
With McKee, Ferrara, or John-
ny Woodruff on the 440 starting
line the Panthers manage to add
eight more points (ﬁve for ﬁrst,
three for second-——one point going
to third place) to their total. En-
rica of Temple should ﬁnish third.
RYDEN SECOND

The 880 looks like anther Pitt
1-2 ﬁnish. Striding Johnny Wood-
ruff and Al McKee will have little
trouble chalking up another eight
points and beating Almus of Tem-
ple to the wire. Pitt will pick up
ﬁve more points in the -mile run
with Johnny Woodruﬁ lopping ofi

the yardage for the Panthers.
Temple will sweep second andi
a

third.
Temple will start piling point-I

age in the two-mile run with a‘

1, 2 ﬁnish; Pitt picking up one
point for third. Kenny Ryden,

rent season today. Four of the
games are set for the Stadium.

Karl “Babe” Stark leads his
club into action at 1 o’clock against
the Cathedrals on the Stadium
diamond. The Starks will be try-
ing for their first win, having
-dropped one and played a tie
thus far. Levine has collected
two of the Starks’ three swats in
the two games.

DIABLOS PLAY

There may or may not be a
game immediately following the
Starks-Cathedrals match. The
Chem Sophs are slated to play the
Bus. Ad. team, but the Biz Ad-
ders have not shown up for any
of their scheduled tilts. If the
game is played, Danko, Carroll,
and Burrier will probably pace
the Sophs’ hitters.

The Diablos, with one win and
one less, battle the Scrantonians
in the 5 o’clock game. Ed Hughes,
Diablos third sacker, has been the
team spark plug in early games,
while Donahue has been a steady
batter. Pitching troubles may
bother the Diablos.

‘DOC’ STARS

What should be the best game
of the afternoon is scheduled be-
tween the Faculty and the Phys.
Ed. Frosh at 6:30. The Faculty
has shown plenty of hustle with
l\/Ieyers, Zehfuss, Carlson, and
Schricker doing the best work.
The Frosh have a fine pitcher in
Straloski, a hard hitting catcher
in Rettinger, and a smooth-fie‘ld-
ing shortstop in Kocheran.

The‘ Phi Kaps meet Kappa Al-
pha Phi at 3:30 in the only game

played on the football practice
field. It will be the slugging of
Phi Kaps Goodell, Urban, Cusick,
and Cambal against the fine pitch-
pig of KAP’s Laucik.

Only two games were played
last Tuesday, but they both were
exciting battles.

The Engineers met the Service
team at the Stadium, and, be-
hind Brown’s two-hit twirling,
downed the Service Boys 6-D. Duf-
fy worked on the mound for the
losers, and although yielding only
three safeties, was wild. Two
singles, two errors, and three pas-
ses gave the winners five mark-
ers in the second.

In the other Tuesday scrap, the
Faculty took its opening match
bydowning the Dithridge Aristo-
crats 7-6. Doc Carlson’s two sin-
gles led the Faculty’s swatting,
while Fullerton slammed a single

and a four-bagger for the Dith- A

ridge outfit. The Aristocrats
chased Dambach from the mound
with a four-run splurge in the
third, but Meyers checked the rush
of base hits.
STORKS DEFEATED

On Wednesday, the Pharmacy
club gained its second victory in
two starts by stopping_the ROTC
13-4 on the football practice ﬁeld.
The druggists out-hit the soldiers
by only a 7-6 margin, but made
use of numerous walks and er-
ors. Walters of the Pharmacy
team slashed out a four master in
the second as the high spot of a
four—run burst, walked in the
third, and banged another round
tripper in the fifth.

Both Stadium games were walk-
aways. In the first game, the
Dents bombed the Chem Sophs
with 12 safe blows and a 14-6
win. scoring five runs in the in-
itial inning.

In the final clash Kappa Alpha
Phi combined ten hits and ten
walks to beat the Starks 17-0.

worst d:ubbing of Conference

Although they both lost tol
Princeton, Georgetown and Penn-

Tigers.

Georgetown’s defeat was espe-
cially surprising as they were
rated in golf circles as the class

of the conference. The George-i

Presents Concert

Violinist, Choir,
Piano Trio Offer

Varied Program
By DOROTHY CLELAND

On. the whole, the concert '
given in the St.epl1+.911 l7‘ost.(-r
Memorial T\‘\’c<lnesday evening
by the \V<'n.11<>i1 Choral under
the <lirection of Mrs. Mildred
C. Lissfelt, was,quit'c well done.
The voices of'th'e Choral were
evenly balancedand the tone
and diction in almost every song
good.

As the opening number, Sleep-
ers Wake, by Bach, started the
concert off successfully; it showed
that the group had something be-
sides a good appearance to offer.

The next number, Ave Verum,
by Mozart, in which the Univer-
sity piano trio consisting of Robert
Brown, C39, cello;_ Harry Goldby,
Ed39, piano; and Mildred .Gardner,
C40, violin, accompanied the
group, was unusually well han-
dled considering that Mozart’s
compositions at their easiest are
difficult to do.

of songs, as far as the audience,

was concerned, was the folk songs, I by Th€OCl01"e A- Siedle, di1’€Cl0‘-‘ Of

which included
other numbers, two songs by Ste-
phen Foster. One of these, Beau-
tiful Dreamer, was effectively
done in unison.

The double sextette, a group of
girls from the Choral, sang two
numbers. Their performance on
the last number, The Old Woman
and The Peddler, by Kinscella, was
better than that of the first, Thou
Art the Night Wind, by Harvey
Gaul.

In making its debut, the A Cap-
pella choir, the other group which
sang, proved that such an organi-
zation of mixed voices should have
been started long ago. The ﬁrst
of their group of numbers, In
These Delightful Pleasant Groves,
by Henry Purcell, was the least
well done of the three.

, VIOLINIST SCORES

The glissando passages in this
number were slurred so that much
of the effect of the passages was
lost. In spite of that, however, the
audience thought the choir rated
an encore, which the group did
not sing. We predict big things
for this organization.

Guest artist at the concert was
Betty Jane Atkinson, young vio-
linist from the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony orchestra. Without a doubt,
Miss Atkinson deserves all the
praise she gets.

She played her selections, ably
accompanied by Miss Leah Colker,
with a brilliance and skill that de-
notes more than mere talent. Par-
ticularly well done were the Reci-
tative, Scherzo Caprice, for violin
alone, by Kreisler, and Introduc-
tion, Rondo Capriccioso, by Saint-
Saens.

Awards Scholarship
Trophy To Fraternity

For achieving the highest

women  fraternities at the

University last year, Delta Phi
Epsilon was awarded a cup at
the inst'allation banquet for the
new I.’anhellenic Council held
last Tuesday in I-leinz House.
Presentation was made by Mrs.
Marthatsmyer, president of Pitts-
burgh Panhellenic association.

The average scholastic standing
of all women’s fraternities was
1.84, which is slightly higher than
in the past few years.

Following the presentation of

the cup, outgoing oﬁicers turned
' over their duties to the new lead-'

ers. Betty N eubrand, Ed38, presi-

_ dent for the past year, in her fare-

well address challenged her suc-
cessor, Betty Batty, C40, to better
the record of the year.

CHAT.-LENGE ACCEPTED

Answering her challenge, and
in recognition of her services, Miss
Batty presented to her predeces-
sor a gold ring, set with a blue
stone from Greece.

Vivien Roberts, C38, passed on
to the new vice-president, Ruth
Custer, C39, a challenge, and re-
ceived in return a silver I link
bracelet. The outgoing secretary
and the treasurer, Ann I-lelfgott,
Ed39, and Leah Hirsch, then each
surrendered to Dorrit Bock, C40,
and Betty Phillips, C40, respec-
tively, their books.

The acceptance speeches were
followed by an address by Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women,
and a round of applause for Miss
Helen Pool Rush, assistant dean of
women, in recognition of her help
during the past year.
