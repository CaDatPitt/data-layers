Faculty
rallies for
support

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Despite the overcast weather
yesterday, several faculty mem-
bers stood outside the William
Pitt Union to “salute spring”
and increase support for United
Faculty, a resource and collec-
tive bargaining organization for
university faculty members.

“We think the time is ripe for
faculty to come together and get
organized,” UF President Mark
Ginsburg said. “We need to
make sure our voice, along with
student, staff and administration,
is heard.”

The activities, sponsored
by UF, included bands, food
and information tables on
the Bigelow Portico and lawn
of the union.

Ginsburg, professor of admin-
istration and policy studies and
sociology, delivered a speech on
behalf of UF.

According to Ginsburg, the
scenario at Pitt is very different
now than in March of 1991,
when the majority of the faculty
voted against UF becoming their
representative in collective bar-
gaining at Pitt.

He said faculty should now
unify to speak against such
issues as salary increases for
highly paid administrators‘
and the decision to use state
“Jump Start” and university
funds to build a convocation
center.

“[By uniting] we can be much
more effective in our work
through the existing governance
system,” Ginsburg said. “We can
put better proposals together
and be sure they are followed
through lonl.”

He said although the Pitt fac-
ulty is committed to the institu-
tion and is not a narrowly self-
interested group, their concerns
still need to be heard.

“Faculty, like other profession-
al workers, should have a rela-
tionship with their employer
that allows them to sit down and

next fall PAT will try to make
the system easier and more con-
venient for Pitt students.

“It’s extremely intimidating if
you’ve never been on a bus
before,” said BS. Leber, a repre-
sentative of PAT. V

Leber, along with fellow rep-
resentative Sharon Buiton, pro-
posed some future PAT ideas
and listened to students’ con-
cerns at a Department of

meeting yesterday.

Bob Harkins, the director of
the Department of Parking and
Transportation, called for the
meeting to try and find a way to
integrate PAT into Pitt’s system.

Pitt professor honored by Chevy Chase Institute

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

Pitt biological scientist Paula Grabowski
has been named a Howard Hughes
Medical Institute Investigator, an honor
that could be worth $3.75 million in
research.

Grabowski, an assistant professor of bio-
logical sciences, is one of 48 scientists
across the country to be honored by the
Chevy Chase Institute.

"The Howard Hughes honor reflects the
individual brilliance and creative talent of
Paula Grabowski,” Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor said.

“It enables her to ask and explore
exciting new questions in human gene-
tics.”

David Burgess, the chair of Pitt's
Department of Biological Sciences, said
he is also enthusiastic about the possibili-
ties.

“This appointment recognizes the general

quality of the Department of Biological
Sciences faculty and places it among the
best in the country," Burgess said.

As a Hughes investigator, Grabowski will
be given funds covering five years to pur-
sue her own research interests.

That will include her field of expertise,
genetics.

“This award will make it possible for
my research group to embark in new
directions and explore questions about

End of school brings mixed emotions for students

For most students the end of
the academic year brings mixed
feelings of accomplishment and
loss. While it’s a happy time of
year, it’s also a time for saying
goodbye to familiar people and
things, and this can be prob-
lematic for some students. It is a
particularly poignant time for
seniors, but other students may
also feel a little emotionally
unsettled.

These feelings of uneasiness
are normal and predictable. The
end of a school year is a time of
transition, and such times tend
to elicit complex emotions in all
of us. It is a time of both antici-

V pation and loss.

There is loss of routine, loss
of old friends and support
networks and, for seniors, the
loss of a college student identity
that has provided a certain feel-
ing of identity for the past few
years.

Transitional periods may also
touch off hidden emotions.
Every step in our growth
process, from infancy to the
present, has involved letting go
of earlier attachments. This “let-
ting go” almost always involves
anxiety. Some
transitions, of
course, are more
significant than
others. Leaving
the womb, enter-
ing school for the
first time and
one’s first lost
love are a few
critical ones.

Coping on
Campus
with Dr.

Roben

Gallagher

these old memories.

The uneasiness or mild feel-
ing of depression that may
occur at these times usually
passes quickly. It’s a good idea,
however, to acknowledge our
present losses and do a little
% thinking about

past losses as

well. Such
activity helps
us to make

sense of at
least some of
our confused
feelings at this
time of year.

T h e

Some of these transitions may
have left some emotional scars.
Consequently, whenever we
encounter a new transitional
period, we need to deal not
only with the reality of the pre-
sent losses but also with the
anxiety that may arise from

good news in all of this is that
the losses we experienced in
the past and may be experienc-
ing now are a necessary part of
continued growth. As Judith
Viorst states in her book
Necessary Losses, “The road to
human development is paved

with renunciation.” We grow
throughout our lives by giving
up some of our deepest attach-
ments. In confronting these
losses we present ourselves
with opportunities for new
growth. Viorst also tells us that
we cannot love deeply without
becoming vulnerable to loss,
and “we cannot become sepa-
rate people [and] responsible
people without some losing and
letting go.”

So take the time you need to
mourn your losses. Then, draw
strength from what has gone
before and use it to help you
make the most of the opportu-
nities that lie ahead.

For those of you who are
returning‘ in the fall, have a
great summer and return
renewed. For those of you who
are graduating, have a great life,
break some new trails and don’t
forget your alma mater.

Ginsburg said.

“It is different than other

Pat Harrington Wysor, the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
humanities representative to the
UF, emphasized the importance
of UF for part-time faculty as
well as for full—time faculty.

“The UF has been very recep-
tive and helpful in working
with [the Coalition for Part-Time

who serves as chair of the coali-
tion.

According to Wysor, one in

Ginsburg said UF is pushing

‘for better resources for all facul-

ty to improve the overall quality
of education at Pitt.

“There are some aspects
of the way the university
is organized which make it
less possible for faculty to
do their job properly,” Gins-
burg said.

“When resources aren’t avail-
able at the library or other
places, it is very hard to do the
kind of research and teaching
that you want to do.”

According to Ginsburg, when
administrators act arbitrarily
and unpredictably, there is a cli-
mate of fear where people do
not speak out or make sugges-
tions.

“Faculty need to be in a posi-
tion where they feel free, in a
responsible way, to speak out
about possible solutions to
problems at the university,” he
said.

“The piece that we haven’t
been very good at holding on
to is the port authority aspect
of our transportation system,”
Harkins said.

One idea that was raised to
help inﬂuence Pitt students to
ride PAT buses was an
increase in the transportation
fee.

However, Harkins, along
with Student Government
Board members Julie Crowell
and Heath Golden, balked at
the idea of an increased fee.

“Raising the transportation
fee is not a valid option,”
Harkins said.

Golden added that the
majority of students SGB rep-
resents do not have a need
for the increase because they

do not
enough.

One plan that Harkins said
is a possibility is selling yearly
passes at discounts to Pitt stu-
dents who commute to cam-

pus.

Harkins said he would not
be able make anything official
until he has the entire budget,

Leber said that because Pitt
offers a “significant number of
riders, there is a possibility of
substantial discounts.”

the workers generate.

Complaints have been espe-
cially loud from Tower C,
where the circular structure car-
ries the sound of drilling
around an entire floor, as well
as a few floors in either direc-
tion.

“I, personally, cannot study
during the time that [the work-
ers] Come in here,” said April
Rodgers, a microbiology major
living in Tower C. “My classes
are suffering. I don’t think it’s
fair.”

Another big complaint from
some students stems from
workers being on women’s
floors early in the morning,
making for an uncomfortable
situation.

“To be on a girl’s floor in the
morning is wrong,” said Kiara
Creyts, a resident of Towe.r C.

“We’re trying to get showers,
and we’re in our robes,”
said Mary Kay Gatto, a biology
major also living in Tower
C.

“But [the workers] are block-
ing the hallway with their

ladders and all their equip-
ment.”

Hopkins said his office has
received complaints from stu-
dents, and as the complaints
come in, his office tries to
explain the situation.

“Certainly we’ve had com-
plaints about the noise
and inconvenience,” Hopkins
said.

“We try to apologize for any
noise that we create.”

According to Hopkins, the
housing office tries to alert
students as to where and
when construction will take
place.

Also, the contractors have
been limited to working
between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., and
have been told to work as qui-
etly  possible.

“Most of the students take a
slightly longer range view, as
does the administration,”
Hopkins said. “That doesn’t
mean that they necessarily like
[the construction]  but our
students have been coopera-
tive, tolerant and understand-
ing.”

Hopkins stressed that this
project is a big undertaking
for the university, and that
it involves much more than
cable.

“We are installing TV cable,”
Hopkins said, “and we are also
installing new telephone distri-
bution lines and setting up a
data backbone for an eventual
computer network system,
allowing for individual ports in
the rooms.”

The computer port system

would be similar to the
one already installed on
the computer floor in

Sutherland Hall, and would
allow direct access to Pitt’s
computer system without using
a modem.

“We’re trying to plan ahead
for the 21st century with this
project,” Hopkins said.

But that fact is lost on stu—
dents trying to study for
upcoming finals.

“This is our life,” said Debbie
Eckstein, a psychology major
from Tower C.

“The cable is not as important
as our finals.”

THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 1994

Anonymity must be protected

The Pittsburgh Tribune Review reported today that
reporters from their paper and from The Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette may be forced to reveal their sources in
the case of a North Hills man who is facing charges of

illegally reselling millions of dollars of stolen merchan-

dise. ,

The defendant’s attorney made a request to force the
reporters who covered the stories for both papers to
reveal their sources. He claims that his client received
unfair publicity which will damage his chances of
mounting a successful defense in his trial. Reporters
were required to attend a closed hearing about this
issue.

The newspapers were expected to argue that this
goes against the newspapers’ constitutional right to
gather news and maintain the anonymity of their
sources. “Under the Pennsylvania Shield Law, reporters
do not have to divulge sources of information”
(Pittsburgh Tribune Review). ‘

If journalists are forced to give up the confidentiality
of their sources, then the whole point of the constitu-
tional provision of freedom of the press is lost. What is
at issuetis the ability of the media to cover things accu-
rately while protecting their sources. If they are unable
to do so, maintaining objectivity becomes increasingly
difficult. In addition, any news-gathering organization
which is known for revealing its sources will find it
hard to continue to report on any but the most benign
subjects. The impetus for many investigative reports
often comes from confidential tips and from sources
who agree to speak on the condition of anonymity.
Also, as one of the cases mentioned in the Tribune
Review points out, information comes from official
sources, but these may be closed to thegpublic and
‘leaked’ to the press by someone on the inside of the
office. If these people are exposed, they would end up
being injuredby the report, when the only purpose of
the media is to report facts to the people.

Finally, anonymous sources may force others who
are accountable to go public with what they know. In
this way, anonymous sources can serve as a con-
science for institutions, government agencies and even
individuals. If these people cannot be protected, they
will not come forward and much will escape the pub-
l‘ic’s attention. Ultimately, people would feel they could
not talk to reporters because that anonymous protec-
tion which brings so many issues to the forefront
would be lost. Protecting the public’s right to know
and the First Amendment right of the freedom of the
press means protecting the sources that newspapers
use. In this case, and all others, the precedents should
be followed and the reporters should not be forced to
reveal their sources.

Readers respond to revisionist ad

Was it naiveté, ignorance or a fast buck that let
you accept money from a Holocaust revisionist
group for an advertisement that appeared in the
April 7 issue of The Pitt News?

Under the guise of questioning the history
about World War II is the ad’s real objective:

‘ foment anti-Jewish racism.

Those who wrote the ad are what they are and
deserve no comment.

Those at The Pitt News who accepted the
money and printed the detritus merit rebuke. To
deny the Nazi War against the Jews is an outrage
against humanity.

I was truly shocked and surprised when I dis-
covered an advertisement for radio and TV publi-
cations of German—born Canadian Ernst Ziindel
in the April 7 issue of The Pitt News, Zundel
belongs to the most infamous neo—Na'./.is. on both
sides of the Atlantic, and several times legal
action was taken against him by Canadian courts
for various reasons (i.e. denying the Holocaust,
hate propaganda against'minorities). Let me tell
you that I consider The Pitt /Vews to be a political-
ly sensible publication which definitely displays a
democratic‘spirit of its journalists; for this reason
I was astonished to find that
you acknowledge the cynical

The Pitt News business manager apologizes for error

 

you have published this out of
a sense of democratic “fairness”
—- that means that you wouldn’t deny even polit-
ical extremists the right to publish their opinions
— then the ad should have at least been accom-
panied by a commentary statement or article. But
in general I think we shouldn’t give the enemy
(which Ziindel truly is) any possibility to express
his dangerous opinions.

In the Thursday, April 7 edi-
tion of The Pitt News, an adver-
tisement appeared expressing
The Revisionist Networks
views on various historical
events. This was a paid adver-
tisement and the views
expressed are considered high-
ly controversial. We would like

to state that the current policy

to publish such advertisements.
Advertisements of similar
nature have not been accepted

We regret the error and are

concerned about the feelings of
our readers. Your responses

"How exactly does
As much as I try to refrain from being critical
of The Pitt News, sometimes a profound oppor-
tunity such as Wednesday’s (April 6) edition is
presented and I have no choice. The front-page
article by» Christine Hanna and the majority
opinion of the editorial board, of which she is a
member, contain so many contradictions and
examples of flawed logic that the 250-word limit
on letters to the editor is a serious constraint.
First, I am curious as to why Chancellor
O’Connor is criticized for his views when he is
“all alone,” while at the same time, the Mt.
Graham Coalition activists are commended for
devoting their time, energy and creativity to
“standing up for what they believe in.” Where is
the difference? Furthermore, if people are to be

commended for this, then Jeffrey Dahmer
should also be commended for devoting his

More quick points: 1) Does the respect for

Patti LaBelle would be proud
of this year’s Panther football
team, as it eagerly enters the
annual Blue-Gold inter-squad
football game this Saturday with
a “New Attitude.”

“We’ve got.a new attitude
because we’re tired of losing
and we want to change that.”
senior offensive guard Reuben
Brown exclaimed.

junior safety David Sumner
shared the same sentiments.

“I would have to agree with
Reuben. Last year we had to
learn a new system and found
ourselves fighting it at times.”
Sumner said. “This year, we’re
all more comfortable with the
system, and there is a consensus
that we’re a much better team
over last year.”

But attitude is not all that
head coach Johnny Majors will
be looking for when the
Panthers take the field against
each other on Saturday after-
noon.

“The attitude of the team has
been excellent so far,” Majors
explained.

“On—Saturday, I will be. look-
ing for poise, effort,.aggressive—
ness and discipline at the spring
game. .

.“I will also be looking for
improvement in all areas as
compared to our performance
in last‘year’s spring game.”

The Panthers have only lost
four starters from last year’s
team and will come into
Saturday’s scrimmage- returning

verygmorning as Ricardo “Ricky” Rowe
wakes uphe looks at his Bob Marley
poster, which is representative of his native
country Jamaica. t
Then he glances at the
other life—size poster, this
one of the late Len Bias (for-
mer University of Maryland
basketball legend), his
teenage idol.

But the thing Rowe
loves to look at most of all is the brick wall
across the street from his Tower C dorm room
window. That’s when the 6-feet-2-inch, 200-
pound strong safety begins to smile. I

The brick wall symbolizes the fact that he is
far away from Penn State.

The former All-Maryland selection at Wilde
Lake High School near Columbia, Md., spent
the early part of his college career playing for
the Nittany Lions of Penn State.

According to Rowe, it wasn’t his decision.

“When I was coming out of high school and
being recruited  where I am from everybody
loves Penn State,” Rowe said. “My family, my
coaches, everybody was pushing Penn State,
Penn State, Penn State. But in the back of my
mind, I really wanted to go to either
Tennessee, UCLA or North Carolina State. But
everybody kept saying Penn State, Penn State,
Penn State.“

Pitt transfer Rowe thankful that he's away from Penn St.

When the 1990 All—Metro Defensive Player of
the Year signed a national letter of intent with
Joe Paterno, his life suddenly turned to a life of
boredom.

“It was the atmosphere,” Rowe said.

“It was really like nothing to do. The worst
thing was when you looked out of the win-
dow, it was like I was surrounded by nothing
but mountains. That kind of got to
me.

‘:'Plus I wasn’t used to being in that kind of
out—in—the—country environment. I needed
some type of action. That country stuff kind of
got to me.”

To make matters worse, during spring of
1993, the talented Maryland native was moved
from defensive back to outside linebacker.

Rowe, who played mostly special teams in
1992, decided to bring his skills to the
University of Pittsburgh, where he has a chance
of cracking into the starting lineup in the
defensive backfield. 9

Initially, it wasn’t that easy. Under NCAA
rules, Rowe was forced to sit out last season
due to his transfer.

“It was frustrating, very frustrating,” he
recalls. '

“I went to one game last year, and that was at
halftime. It was the halftime of the Louisville
game.

“It was frustrating playing on scout team.
Also. hearing the results of the games was very,
very frustrating. But I guess I kind of needed

Recently a local newspaper

question about whether aging
musicians should retire or con-

pride in the name of populari-

The article focused primarily

on Frank Sinatra, but one
group pictured and discussed
in the article was that favorite

unique sound landscapes that
challenge listeners.

While different members
have come and gone, AMM
now consists of Eddie Prevost
on percussion, Keith Rowe on
guitar and electronics and John
Tilbury on piano. The band’s
recorded output is scant, eight
releases throughout its exis-
tence, but the band laid the

\. x. u

     

nsemﬁ e

  

        
   
     
 

  

groundwork for the free impro-
visation throughout Europe and
the United States.

Listening to AMM can require
a good deal of effort. but it
proves rewarding when given
full attention.

The trio works as an improvi-
sational unit with three instru-
mentalists blending together to
create a sound that dissolves
the boundaries of each member
and who is playing what on
their instrument.

Their most recent release,
Neug/ozma’/arid, is one long, 76-
minute piece which provides a
good introduction to their
agenda. The first 45 seconds
consists of silence. This could
be part of the piece itself or the
time it takes for the musicians
to prepare to play. Different
musical textures rise and fall
and move to the next section
without an obvious transition.
In one section, the piano and
drums touch on free jazz while
electronics sputter on top of
them. This gives way to some
slow chimes.

Half of the CD must be heard
with the volume halfway up
due to the constant rise and fall
of the volume and instrumenta-
tion.

While Nezzgfourza’/aria’ moves
slowly, it keeps its momentum
as it moves through its different
shapes and moods.

Beck
Mellow Gold
Geffen

To try to figure out what
Beck is. it’s important to know
what Beck 1'sn’t:

He’s not your average folk
singer.

He’s not your average white
rapper wannabe.

He’s not your average acid—
tripping loon.

But on the surface he is an
amalgamation of all of those
things — a folk guitarist with a
hip—hop, programmed drum

beat, a soulful blues harp and
acid-trippin’ lyrics which he
delivers with an effective
whine. He even throws in a lit-
tle sitar in later tracks strictly
for flavoring.

Beck may be of this earth,
may be of another galaxy, or
may _be of a record producer’s
imagination.

Mellow Gold, his first major
label release, is nothing if not
entertaining. At times its post-
modern swirl sounds imagina-
tive and fresh, if not somewhat
contrived.

His first single, the oh-so-

catchy “Loser” is running neck-

admirably  keeping in mind
he’s no Son House.

Beck crosses into sheer pop
with “Nitemare Hippy Girl,”
and after getting “crazy with
the Cheezwiz” in some of the
more upbeat songs, Beck
becomes decidedly Dylanesque
with “Pay No Mind (Snoozer),”
a somber acoustic ballad.

As retro as “Pay No Mind” is.
“Suckin’ Soul Jerk" seems as if
it was stolen right off the

Hey, don’t I know you? Yeah

ers, paroleofficers, social
workers, religious leaders, pets,
apple pie, the national anthem,
the flag the American
Dream. Yeah  I know you 
should have been aborted.

If you have ever heard any of
the above diatribe, then I have
the ultimate toilet reader for
you —— Neil Howe and Bill
Strauss’ J3!/.FGen. You were
born between the years 1961
and 1981. You are the 13th
generation in the United States
to know those swell symbols of
American joy —— the flag and
the constitution. You are one of

 

approximately 80 million that
share the burden of our forefa-
thers’ (and mothers’) hypocrisy
and contradiction.

The authors are a pair of
appropriately apologetic baby-
boomers. They are sociologists
(two strikes). But they have
crafted a startling expose of
generational crime. This book
is three-dimensional. There is a
well-researched, easily-
digestible foundation written by
the authors, that traces the ado-
lescence of the 13th generation.
There is an e-mail dialogue
between the authors and a
caustic 13er, who does an
admirable job representing his
cohorts. And lastly, there is an
interwoven section of statistics
and quotes from both non-
13ers‘and numerous 13er lumi-
naries, among them Douglas
Coupland, Bret Easton Ellis,
Hard Harry (“Pump Up the
Volume”), Richard Linklater,
Ferris Beuller, Nirvana and of
course, “Downtown” Julie
Brown.

This is undoubtedly one of
the best sociological texts I
have read. (This is, counterintu-
itively, a compliment.) The
authors were unexpectedly
without self—rigl1teousness. This
is a major coup for my parents,
who bought this book for me
last Christmas. Reading it, I was
struck by two penetrating

Continued from page S-6
overall the record has enough
songs to save it from one-hit-
wonder status.

Lyrically, the high school
dropout almost invariably hits
with his spoken or chanted
words. “She’s playing footsie
with another dimension” or
“The sails climb high through
the garbage-pail sky like a
giant dildo crushing the sun” or
“Gonna break my face on the
sweet sunshine” work well
with the cloudy atmosphere of
sound that seems to take prece-
dence on most of his songs. He
misses sometimes, but when
you write about couches, pota-
to chips and exploding televi-
sion sets, there are more than
enough chances to pull some-
thing out of one of his songs
other than the occasional dud.

The eccentricity of the album
is seriously assuaged by the
catchiness of “Loser,” which

‘93. Once drawn into the album
it is very entertaining, which is
what “Loser” represents —
ephemeral thrills with not
much philosophy to chat about
over coffee and cigarettes.

But the question that has yet
to be answered is whether he’s
an authentic different, or a
packaged different that is going
to sell some records.

His musical history — he
kicked around the Midwest
after leaving school playing
folk music and Delta blues
before trying some more hard-
core music back East in New
York — and resume of indie
albums makes this first major-
label release more palatable for
cynics who think he’s a con-
trived idea of someone ‘way up
in the record industry.

And with plans to release
more albums on various indie
labels, Beck might not show up
on the pop charts again for a
while.

The Veldt
Afmdtsiac
Mercury

North Carolina is a pretty
happening place. Its subdued
atmosphere has been the
breeding ground for some great
music, from Thelonious Monk
to SuperChunk. In come the
Veldt. Don’t assume that the
Chapel Hill—based quartet is
anything like the bands you
love on Merge Records. T hey’re
not. The Veldt abandons rock
and roll and attempts to blend
African-American funk, via
Prince, and English shoe-gazer
pop/punk via The Jesus and
Mary Chain, and fail quite mis-
erably. Take a lesson from
Primal Scream; give up, this
union is ridiculous.

The Veldt’s first and only
release, Afr0dz'siczc, features
Danny Chavis and twin Daniel
Chavis singing and playing gui-
tar, David Burris on bass and
Marvin Levi on drums. The title
and several songs nod to
Danny, Daniel and Marvin’s
African-American heritage. It
also implies some kind of stim-
ulation  if only! The first
tune, aptly titled “Intro (I’ll Say
Anything)” is a 26-second rap,
“Do you love me? I love you
 Similar is the tenth track,
“Interlude” in which someone
spells “V-E-L-D—T.” Both are
uninteresting, and seem to rip

off some of the instrumental
ideas of De La Soul, or A Tribe
Called Quest. There are two
other songs dealing with an
African-American theme: “You
Take the World” and
“Revolutionary Sister.”

“You Take the World” starts
with sterile, jangly guitars.
Danny, or was it Daniel sings,
“You take the world like you’ve
already done/Your diamonds
and your pearls/Your cops and
your guns  The chorus tries
to be heavy, as do the lyrics,
“And don’t tell me there’s no
blood up on the stairs/Of some
brother and I didn’t
care/There’s a revolution
startin’ just wait and see.” If
you want to hear about the
realities of African-American
life, listen to KRS—1, or West
coast rap. Their message will
be more realistic and their
delivery more genuine.
“Revolutionary Sister” is a
noble song celebrating the
African-American woman. It
proclaims, “Bitches are dogs,
and a hoe is a tool,” but lacks
the passion and verve of
Queen Latifah.

The rest of the album shows
the Veldt’s British influence. On
many of the songs the band
sounds like Ned’s Atomic Dust
Bin. The guitar sounds are
ambient, and reverb-ridden,
while the rhythm section
sounds like the Rolling Stones.
The vocals are forceful, throaty

and exaggerated. Danny
attempts to be passionate and
succeeds in achieving overkill.
His lyrics are worse. For exam-
ple, “Soul in a Jar,” the hit song
(if there is one) has Danny
pouting,” Soul in a Jar/How
wonderful thou are/I can’t hold

a candle to your love, babe.”

Can you say “profound” with
your tongue in cheek? What,
was he reading Shakespeare
while writing this? There are
two remixes of the song: one
by The Jesus and Mary Chain,
one by Diamond D. “The
Guitar Mix” is Diamond D’s
shot at rescuing the song; it is
hardly a remix, and does not
seem to showcase the guitar.
The Jesus and" Mary Chain’s
“Drugstore Mix” is the only
decent song on the album. The
Mary Chain revamp the entire
song, covering its faults in a
mass ofguitar distortion and
jarring texture.

“Heather” sounds like every
other song on the album. The
words are equally cheesy,” Hey
does it feel so bad  can I
take you out tonight?” The gui-
tars whine and drone, and one
of the most cliched sax I’ve
heard in a while “flavors” the
song. “Juicy Sandwich” sounds
like a lame Cure rip—off. To
continue to analyze the other
songs would be-~—'a waste of
time. All of the remaining
songs contain similar song
structures, vocal melodies and
are devoid of soul and charac-

After missing a year with injuries,
Stevens rebounds impressively in '94

By Ed Ziegenfuss

Staff Writer

ho says that a sequel

can’t be as good as the

original? One Lady
Panther gymnast has proven
that wrong. She is sophomore
sensation Brenda Stevens.

Last season Brenda suffered
an ankle injury which kept her
out for the better part of the sea-
son.

“I had high expectations last
year and when I got hurt I

didn’t enjoy gymnastics for a ’

while,” Stevens said.

“I wasn’t contributing to the
team.”

Feeling disappointed, deject-
ed and a little bit irritable,
Stevens picked herself up and
returned to post a strong finish
to last season by competing on
the uneven bars.

“I knew if Brenda could stay
healthy, she would have the

potential to be one of the best, ,

if not the best, all—arounders for
our team,” head coach Debbie
Yohman said.

For the most part this season,
Stevens made Yohman sound
like a prophet. Stevens
remained healthy and posted
many good scores until another
injury to the same ankle kept
her laid up for approximately
two weeks. Stevens still inan-
aged to have a strong
season.

Stevens registered season-
high scores of 9.65 on the bal-
ance beam and a 9.45 twice on
uneven bars, only to break that
mark at NCAA regionals with a
9.50.

On the floor exercise,
Stevens’ high score was a 9.55.
In the vault, her best was a
9.375, and in the all-around she
posted a 37.925, which was
good enough to put her on the
top.10 all—time list at Pitt.

“I was happy to be in the all-

. around lineup this year because

it was nice to contribute to the
team score,” Stevens said. “I felt
I had a consistent year this sea-
son.” 6

The end of this year, howev-
er, was a bittersweet one for
Stevens.

“I am proud of myself for fin-
ishing third in balance beam at
ECACS and for making it to
regionals,” she said.

“I was disappointed, though,
that the team did not go with
me to both regionals and
ECACS.”

One thing that Stevens did
accomplish this season was
becoming the team leader.

On a young team trying to
find its identity, Stevens stepped
to the front and grabbed the
reins by consistently performing
at the top of her game.

“Brenda is a leader by exam-
ple for our team,” Yohman said.
“She is the quiet leader. She
does what has to be done.”

Stevens said that Yohman and
assistant coach Ben Rovee have

 

been good influences on her
and the rest of the team.

“I like when Ben gets excited,
it really motivates you,” Stevens
said.

“Debbie and Ben do not put a
lot of pressure on you, which
makes it easier to compete.”

This past weekend, Stevens
traveled to Rhode Island to
compete in the NCAA Eastern
Regionals competition.
Although she did not advance
on to nationals, Stevens still had
a good meet.

On bars, she scored a 9.50, a
-new season—high score. On
beam, she fell attempting a new
series of greater difficulty but
still scored a 9.125.

In the floor exercise, Stevens
scored a 9.15, and added a

9.225 on the vault. This totals
up to an all-around score of
57.00.

“It was tough without a team
there, but it was a positive
experience for me,” Stevens
said.

“I now see what level the
team has to be at for next year
so that we can make it to
Regionals next season.”

Stevens said that she wants to
go home to Eastern
Pennsylvania and relax before
beginning to gear up for next
season.

“I want to stay injury-free,”
Stevens said.

“I want the team to do a lot
better and I want to put more
difficulty in my routines at the
beginning of the year.”
