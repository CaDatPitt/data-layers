Revival of Former Tradition

Sought After Discovery  
Of 56-Year-Old Brass Chain '

By JOHN DeNINNO
A tradition harking from the days when college stu-
dents/wore handlebar mustaches and Pitt was still the
Western University of Pennsylvania may again be put to

practice.

A few months ago Mr. E. A. Batchelder, assistant regis-

trar, accidently came upon an

  

,.:s ‘ "
J. Clyde Barton and the newly discovered cham

‘old, brass chain in the regis-

trar’s supply room. After inspecting it closely he saw that
the date of ayear had been engraved on each link. These
dates ranged consecutively from 1897 to 1918. " ,

He took the odd, heavy chain to the dean of men’s of-
ﬁce, feeling that at one time it must have been a tradition

of some kind. In, turn Dean

handed the chain over to the Pitt Newsand askedius to .

‘Barton is getting together a com-

Here’s what we found.
‘ In 1914 M. P. Baird, who wrote
thewords to our Alma Mater and
who was then secretary of the
Alumni, Association, decided that
the growth of the University
should be somehow symbolized.

, He hit upon the idea of an ever

growing chain.
Syrnbolize Growth

Mr. Baird thought that, if at the
annual alumni banquet a gradu-
ating senior representing his class

_‘.would present a link for the chain
to the alumni, the growth and

. strength of the school through the

"men and women it sent out into
iihe‘ world would be permanently
symbolized.

He took his plan to Roy C. Mc-

miliar to all students and an an-

the twice-yearly process of reg-

enthusing Mr. McKenna with the
idea they both set about making
ti a reality. -
First Link Forged

Since Mr. McKennarmanufac-
tured brassvthe chain was to be
of that material. The ﬁrst date on
the chain, 1897, is the year Mr.
the
Western University of Pennsyl-
vania (Pitt). He is now a member
of the Board of Trustees.

Links were cast with dates up
to 1918 and so a new tradition
was born. However it lived for
only four years.

In 1918 because of the war and
other factors the tradition was
quietly dropped. At that time it
represented 21 graduating classes.

Alumni Head Enthused

With this information we went
to J. Clyde Barton, secretary of
the general alumni association,
who was immediately interested
since he feels Pitt does not have
enough traditions.

He said that a school as old as

crawling with traditions.”
To prove his enthusiasm Mr.

tempt to re-establish the tradition_

erating Theater.”

The Majestic, only travelling
showboat left in the World,- WOWS
its audiences along the Ohio and
Monongahela Rivers by presenting
old-fashioned melodramas such
as “Ten Nights In a Bar—Ro0m”
and “Treachery Revenged,” plus
sparkling vaudeville.

New Audiences

True, those who line the levees
and wharves at the call of the
showboat’s Calliope are not the
river—crowd of yesteryear who
crowded the famous ﬂoating the-
aters of a century and more ago.

Today’s audiences are accustom-
ed to drama, comedy, and to corn
on TV and movie screens, if not
on stage. ' »

But few theaters anywhere, pro-
fessional or amateur, are purvey-

ics, sociology, political science,
languages and education as well
as speech and dramatics. Versa-

tility, rather than exceptional .tal-.-
ent, is the keynote to being a
successful “showboat,er.”

Course Unique

The uniqueness of the Hiram
College “intensive study plan”_
makes possible the long season
for the Majestic and crew. ,At
Hiram the students take only one
course for seven weeks. At the
completion of that course, they
move on to another one for seven
more_ Weeks, and so on through
ﬁve of the “quinters.” Therefore,
the showboat students can enter
Hiram at the end of the ﬁrst term,
about November 1, and take right
up with a new course. Of course,
their six hours’ credit for their
showboat work makes up the deﬁ-
cit of the ﬁrst term missed while
ﬂoating around on their showboat.

boat about an hour before cur-
tain time shows a couple of cos-
tumed girls busily working the
popcorn machine, a villain of hide-
ous proportions pushing the soft-
drink sales, a couple of mustach-
ioed ‘characters banging the keys
of the raucous calliope, and vari-
ous and sundry performers sneak-
ing a last look at: the precious
script, or busily slapping on their
make-up for the performance.

What ever it might be, work or
play or experience, the showboat
seems to remain an experience
these college students will never
forget. Nor will those people who
visit the last traveling showboat
in the world. - -

Not Only the Froslr

Instead of aiming our official “welcome’.’ editorial at the
incoming freshmen, we’d like to extend our. greetings to
the other students and faculty members who are new to
our campus. Transfer students and new faculty members
have undoubtedly had their taste of college life but there
is not one of them who is so capable, so mature, and so
independently able that he can plunk himself down 1n_- the
middle ‘of large university and be at ease. You are, in a
sense, freshmen and Pitt will be as new and strange as the
_college or university you ﬁrst attended seemed when you
began that initial academic year.

About all we can promise for the approximately 800
incoming freshmen is a vastly new and ‘exciting experi-
ence. It will be new andexcitingbecause you are making
a difficult transiticfn from being a comparatively large frog

_in a little pond to the status ofa ﬂedgling tadpole in the

middle of Lake Erie. .

Your growth and progression into the frog stage-again
and the comparative shrinking of the lake will be a gradual
progress altered only by your“ individual characteristics.
In high school you heard the statement: “Beneﬁts derived
from something are in direct proportion to the amount
of time, effort, ‘and enthusiasm put into them.” Sure, it is
a trite old phrase, but you’ll ﬁnd that it takes on a whole
new set of values and the. meaning is almost doubled when

. applied to your‘ enrollment at Pitt. Your stay at the Uni-

O

versity can be enjoyable, a thankless chore, or a so-so propo-
sition, depending entirely on you. You’ll ﬁnd it won?t’ take
much effort to hop right into place here and really start
enjoying college life; it will be rather diﬁicult to become

;.-bored during the next four years, and a violent dislike for

the University will be a novel occurrence indeed. You may
not agree with or appreciate certain aspects of college life

"in the middle of a big city; but with fairly decent eyesight

you’re bound to ﬁnd something to attract and hold your
interest. When classes begin next Monday, start looking
around for that “something.” It may be an activity, it may

V be a particular ﬁeld of study, or it may be the people around

here. Try saying “Hi” to the folks you meet in the halls
and on the campus; you’ll be surprised at what it will mean
to you and to them. ~

A Rene ml of Polio: y  
Although a statement of policy was includedlin one of
the later issues of the News last semester, a renewal of

our position on the matter of editorial policy should not be =

construed as chewing our cabbage twice. It would be easy
to say that we stand ‘for the campus equivalents of God
and Country but -too many crimes can be clouded under
these titles and we do not propose to join the ranks of hy-
pocrites. As the situations, arguments, plans, conﬁicts, pro-
posals, and what-not arise, we will try to meet, if not anti-
cipate,-them and make our stand at the proper time.

We will attempt to be fair, just, and accurate. We are
not functioning as a publicity media for any group. or

‘ groups, nor are we striving to be athouse organ for the

University. We will set our sights on complete University
coverage with the most space’ devoted to articles affecting
the largest amount of students. Where space limitations

_ necessitate the cutting or complete withdrawal of articles,

timeliness, importance, and news-value will govern ‘our
choice. , _ _ .

Editorials may be construed as the editorial policy. of
the paper and the handiwork of the editor. Signed columns,
will ‘present the views of the individual writer and do not
necessarily reflect the opinion of the newspaper. Letters
to the Editor are not only acceptable but .welcome. Letters
must be signed with the writer’s name and school, but sig-

. natures may be withheld- on request at the editor’s dis-

).

Huey Long’s slogan of “Every man a king”

seems to have been amended‘ a few years back
to include the fair sex and make every woman a

queen. _ _
Beauty- queens were once tops in royalty, but-

the top of the scale was reached when Miss Uni-

ﬁguratively knocked the pins
from beneath Miss America.

No higher title was left, with
the possible exception of a Miss
Cosmos. One thing led to an-
other and there wasn’t enough
beauty — to go around, so the
search for titles shifted to the
farm.

Starting with maple syrup
time and continuing into the

‘mistletoe season, we are now faced with a suc-

cession of Misses Chestnut Blight, Corn Borer,

. and Turnip Greens.

Royalty made up by females is rare, but we

Freshman Cam

By Tim Kovar
Remember the old saw that goes: “You can’t
teach an old dog new tricks?” Nuts! It’s all
wrong. The YMCA at Pitt annually sponsors a
weekend camp for freshman men at Camp Kon-
O-Kwee near Zelienople for the purpose of in-
.doctrinating our new arrivals with Pitt songs,
cheers and chants, customs, traditions, and down
to earth bull sessions with fac- 
ulty advisors. Approximately 30
upperclass counselors attend the
camp to keep things organized
and aid the frosh. Dividing the
men up into groups under the
regulation school headings of
College, Bus. Ad, Engineers, and
_Pre—Meds, the freshmen‘ take
part in athletic competition, songs

 

trophy in the oﬂing for the winning group.
Indoctrination _. " -

The purpose, naturally,’ is to make the fresh-
men feel at home and give then a head-start in
getting to know their way around Pitt by meeting
each other, upperclassmen andsome "of the fac-
ulty. Having attended the camp as a freshman
and again this year as a counselor and photogr:i-
pher, it seemed to me that the faculty and coun-
selors were deriving a great deal of. beneﬁit from
the experience also. We met new people, ‘renewed
old acquaintances, and even met some guys that

Men will no longer be known as Mr. Smith
or Mr. Jones. -Instead, people will point them out
as “the husband of the girl who was queen of the
sauerkraut festival in. 1958.” Congress will be pse-
titioned to pass laws giving equalrights to men
who will be shocked in 1960 when they read of a
report by a Dr. Matilda Kinsey.

child in the United States can claim peerage. None ‘ .
of your two hundred year old stuff either, but’

Weddings will be arranged according to‘ 3. ~

strict caste system with the families ofthe Prairie
Queen and the Irish ., Potato lass both trying to
marry into a better circle.

There is only one dark" spot for the future--_

they’re using queens too quickly. It’s a poor grown «

ing season when a town can’t‘ﬁnd something for

which to name a queen, but a southern town was -

forced to pick a. young growing thing of ﬁfteen
to reign over the likker stills. They had to cancel
her reception when her mother declared shewas
too young to be out at night. . L

It all adds up to one thing. When ‘your buddy’
says he has a date with a queen—don’t doubthim.

have been around for a few nears that we never
got to know. ‘

It was rather interesting to note how the usuo .

ally calm, collected, campus “wheels” ‘let their hair
down and knocked themselves out in the process
of encouraging their charges in the race for the’

trophy. Not a few of them came back from, the.

camp with voices that could barely ‘reach a whis-
per and throats that ached with every mouthful

, of food.

Faculty. Too _ V

The faculty advisors and staff members .could
not help put gain something in the‘ way of ex-
perience in dealing with people. Decked _out__ in
slacks, sweaters and sweatshirts, they officiated at
the sports events, served as judges for the "dra-
matic efforts, and got "used to having fellows 20
years younger call them by their ﬁrst names. They
too could let down their professional mien and put

everything into theutraditional Frosh—Faculty soft- '

ball game. It was something to see Assistant -Track
Coach Lloyd Duff steaming around third base in
an effort to score from second; or Dean T. VW. Bid-
dle, Marshall Joe Hedges, and Duff all chasing a
pop-ﬂy thatthey never did get because of a high
wind. The faculty team lost by two runs but the
score was not the important yardstick’ of measure-
ment. ‘ _ . '

a d m in i stra-
tion.

SC has an-

will again try
for faculty ad-
visors , a n d ,
since it will
p r 0 bably be . .
another long fought issue, we
will refrain from any comments
and simply state both sides to the
controversy.

The Present Picture

As it stands now, a few schools
hold dean’s conferences for fresh-
man. At t h e s e conferences

courses and ﬁelds are explained. ’

When the freshman year is com.-
pleted the student may choose an
advisor in his school. (if the
school follows that policy).

Most schools offer, advising
service. only if the student re-
quests it.

Student Congress’ plan is to
have‘ each freshman assigned to

‘ an adviser when he enters the
. University. . This.-faculty adv-isor E ,

I ..would __rernain..with'=.the. student-V’

 

  

 
   

fo_r his four year stay at Pitt and

would preferably be from the ,

same department as, the student.
Students in Favor
SC conducted a student poll

last semester and the results _~

were in favor of faculty advisors.

The administration contends
that the SC plan is not necessary
and the deans of the several
schools explained why.

Stanton C. Crawford, dean of
the School of Business Adminis-
tration, said that he had tried
personal advising and it did not
work. His school uses the dean’s
conference for freshman for ad-

vising students.

G. R. Fitterer, dean of the‘ '

School of Engineering and Mines,
said that the atlvising should‘ be
done inthe high schools. Hisl
school holds student seminars

and conferences with students*”

when theiy request them.
Advised Each Semester

The School of Education calls: I

in its students each semester for
the purpose of advising them, ’ac-.

cording to Samuel 'P. Franklin,/v

dean of the school. ~

All of the remaining schools
follow the same general opinion
and policies with only slight

. variations.

The switch to one—platoon foot-

go both ways. .

Of course, All-American Eldred

since they played with both pla-

Kraemer, though, has been mov-

ed to guard in an effort to

The left end of the line shows
a battle between? Joe Zombek, for
two seasons a defensive standout,

and John Paluck, a promlslngt

The backﬁeld is just as uncer-
tain now as it was at the end of
spring drills. Henry Ford, Pete
Neft, Rudy Mattioli, and. Billy
Hoffman are the quarterbacks
and any one could open the sea-

son, although Ford and Neft seem
to hold the edge after the ﬁrst
two weeks of practice.

The halfback positions are wide
open with nine candidates holding
key places in the running. Richie
McCabe, who starred on defense
the past two years, has been given
serious consideration for right half
while senior Ray Ferguson has
shown well on the other side after
two seasons on the defensive pla-
toon. _ '

Chet Rice, plus sophs Bob Grier,
Gene Steratore, Don Michaels, and
Ray D1Pasqua1e have also been

Joe Capp has been running hard

Early Wins Could
Produce F Loco! Boom

By RUSS FRANKE

u

Sports Editor

Pitt’s resurgence into" the national football spotlight_is
timed so well with the Pittsburgh area’s hunger  a Wm-

 ner that this may be .a banner year for Stadium attendance.

The advance sale of season tickets picks up each week

and almost everywhere you

go where the Sports-minded

, congregate, talk always seems to center around the coming
season. Football, of course, ‘always scents the air heavily
at_the ﬁrst sign of autumn, but this year fans are not just talking
?'about the big games——they’re talking about going. ‘
' Pitt will click oﬁ three games in a row—West Virginia.
' ' Oklahoma, and Nebraska/—to start the ovoid rolling, with the
Sooners touted as the sweetmeat of the trio, attendance-wise.
‘ A ‘The ‘ national ‘favorites from Norman are expected -to draw a
human ﬂood to the Oakland district, in making their first Pitts-

. burgh appearance.

__ But first there is a little matter of several thousand screaming,
bloodthirsty, evil—bent hill people from West Virginia who expect to
come up here and chew up our goal posts again this year. The
ones -we’ve talked to, or tried to talk to, are shocked to hear that
.our Panthers even have "a. chance. At any rate, the largest crowd
‘in history to see a Pitt—WVU game is expected to show up; that is,

‘shoes tied on my boys.”

~ as‘. Mountie Coach Art Lewis said last winter, “if I can git the

 They’re good sports though, even _if they do live just to beat us‘
A (and Penn State) and,‘ totell the truth, last year’s upset was good

for the series.

,‘ 1 "Nebraska, too, should draw a sizeable crowd,. particularly
if the locals are fortunate enough to squeeze past Oklahoma.
The more optifnistic think they can do it, looking toward Notre
Dame as the _big"one to. win. The ‘frightening fact is that Notre -
Dame will be laying for Pitt this season. 5

"The Irish have an open date the Saturday before the game,

-‘plenty of time to succor their vengeance and sharpen up, and

have set aside the ‘meeting as Knute Rockne Day,‘ adding another

‘psychological factor.

‘Red Dawson is much chagrined over the "optimism displayed
by those who are already chalking up a 7-2 record for Pitt. “We’re
,not that good,” he says, hauling out the football coaches wetblanket.

Dawson points to the fact
.. “up” for his boys, now that

that all the opponents will be

the Panthers have established

.’themselves. And with the platoon rule change, who can tell?

I That’s another factor that will boost attendance'al1 over, not
only here. With a little luck in the ﬁrst few games, plus the kind
of football Dawson is dishing up, the ﬂed old days of a packed
-Stadium may be right on the horizon.

Olson Depends    

On Returning Harrier Vets

By PAUL HARRISON

At the outset of his 21st year at the helm of Pitt’s
Cross—Country team, Coach Carl Olson shows signs of dis-
may at the possibilities of his team to repeat last year’s 7-1
record. However, three returning lettermen, along with a
host of seasoned harriers hope to erase his worries and
turn them into smiles. ’ ' ,

The 1953 schedule shows one triangular meet with Colum-
bia and Rutgers combined with’
nine other matches which include
the IC4A and NCAA champion-
ships. In addi-
tion to the reg-
ular card the.
J u n i o r a n d
S enior Alle-
gheny Moun-
tain Associa-
tion meets
have‘ been
booked for No
vember. -

Dan Sommer,
Don Delli Gat-
ti, and Allan, ozson
Ciunderson are r
the vets of the last year’s cam-
paign who together never ﬁnished

below ﬁfth in their running as-
signments. Ronnie Sallade, Don
Doyle, Chuck Fritz, Jesse Weigel,
Dave Freas, Ernie Fredericks, and
Pete Kress all ran for the var-
sity in competition and are bat-
tling for top berths. Three mem-
bers of the past season’s fresh-
man squad are: Bob Cherry, Wal-
ter Starz and Don-McClintok.
“We have some good boys with
us this year but I» don’t expect
them to match 1ast_season’s rec-
ord,” Coach Olson said. As for the
possibilities of the new sophomore
runners gaining starting assign-
ments Olson commented, “I’m
afraid they don’t. have a chance

   

to break in.”

Good Record

Only two of- the 1952 squad
have departed from the team.
Captain Bernie Luterancik, .own-
er of the home —course record of
22:08.7, graduated and Dick Web-
er, Olson’s stellar number two
man, enlisted in the Army la
semester. '

Over the past two seasons the
Harriers have compiled a record
of 13 victories in 15 starts. Until
they were beaten in a triangular
meet with Army and Syracuse,
last season, the Panthers ran up
a skein of eleven straight con-
quests. ,

Coach Olson pointed out the
team is by ,no means in such a
shape that each man is sureof
his position, therefore, if any stu-

dent is interested in running as.
a part of the team he can contact .
Mr. Duff at the Field House. As,

Olson puts it, “the more the mer-
rier and the stronger our team
will -be.” . ‘
