Pitt likely
to avoid
nonprofit
scrutiny

Shruti Revankar
Staff Wrz'ter

One of Pittsburgh’s largest nonproﬁt
organizations is under scrutiny as
the city questions its tax—exempt
status, but Pitt can_ likely breathe a. —_
sigh of relief. '
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl in-

forrned the public on March 20

that the city will challenge the
tax—exempt status of UPMC. This
announcement was foreshadowed
by Allegheny County Controller
Chelsa Wagner’s June 2012 issue of

_ “Taxpayer Alert,” in which it was

publicized that UPMC held such
status and was costing the county
millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Along with UPMC, Wagner also
pinpointed Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, Duquesne University and even
Pitt as tax—exempt organizations
that were costing the county rev-
enue dollars. These organizations
that could potentially come under
scrutiny are tax—exempt because
they were previously designated
“purely public charity.”

The HUP test, derived from the
1985 Pennsylvania Supreme Court
case Hospital Utilization Project v.
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
determines what constitutes a pure-
ly public charity worthy of tax-ex-
empt status. The organization must
fulﬁll each of the ﬁve points of the

. test: advance a charitable purpose,

donate a substantial portion of its
services, beneﬁt a substantial and

The Pitt Athletic Department an-
nounced on Monday night that
Coach Agnus Berenato will not
return for another season as the
head coach of the women’s bas-
ketball team. I
Berenato -— who has led the
Pitt team since 2003 and became
the all-time winningest coach in
Pitt women’s~basketball history
this past December —~ leaves Pitt
after two consecutive seasons of
going winless in Big East confer-

ence play. _ .

“We thank Agnus for her con-
tributions to the University and
wish her only the best in her future
pursuits,” Athletic Director Steve
Pederson said in a press release.

Berenat0’s contract extension
in 2008 would have kept her in
Pittsburgh until the 2015-2016
season.

Berenato and members of the
women’s basketball team could not

; be reached for, comment.

From 2007 to 2009, Bere-
nato took the Panthers to three
consecutive NCAA tournaments,

including two Sweet 16 appear-
ances. Since her hiring on May 1,
2003, Berenato compiled a ﬁnal

‘Big East record of 64-111 (.366)

and an overall record of 161-149
(-519). I

A national search for a new
head coach will begin immediately.

“We have high aspirations for
Pitt women’s basketball and have
witnessed the program achieving
at impressive levels in_the past,”
Pederson said. “As we begin [At-
lantic Coast Conference] playnext
season, the time is right for a lead-
ership change in the program.” I

indeﬁnite class of persons who are legitimate
subjects of charity, relieve the government
of some of its burdens and operate free from
private-proﬁt motive.

In April 2012, the state Supreme Court
decided that if a given organization does not
pass all ﬁve parts of the HUP test, then they
are not eligible for tax—exempt status under
Act 55. Act 55 was passed in 1997 to further
clarify the HUP test.

Although UPMC is the most notable or-
ganization the county is investigating, there
are a number of other nonproﬁt institutions
in the area being evaluated against the HUP
test, according to Allegheny County Director
of Communications Amie Downs.

“Allegheny County is currently conducting
a review of over 2,800 parcels that are cur-
rently exempt as ‘institutions of purely public
charity,’ including those owned by UPMC and
Pitt,” Downs said in an email.

Downs said the process started about a
month ago and that it’s intended to make
certain that all property owners who claim
to exist for a charitable purpose are paying
their fair share in taxes. Decisions regarding
tax-exemption status will be determined by
the laws that govern these exemptions.

Pitt’s status

It remains to be seen how the push to re-
evaluate the status of tax—exempt institutions
in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County could
affect Pitt in the near future. '

Pitt spokesman John Fedele declined to
comment on the University’s tax—exempt sta-
tus, Pitt’s stance on the evaluation of nonproﬁt
tax—exempt status or what steps the University
will take, if challenged.

Despite Downs’ assertion that Pitt could
face the same questions over its status as a
'tax—exempt«nonproﬁt entity, Brad Korinski,
the Allegheny County Controller’s Ofﬁce’s
general counsel, said he doesn’t believe Pitt
is in the same situation as UPMC.

 ‘ ' Korinski said, “Even if the city wanted to
challenge Pitt, like how they’re doing against
UPMC, it wouldn’t hold up in court.”

, “Pitt still has an exemption under Act 55
because [the] provision [exempting universi-
ties] wasn’t struck down by the Pike County
Case,” Korinski said.

i V Act 55 is a Pennsylvaniabill that protected
non-proﬁts and made it difficult for localities
to challenge their tax exemptions. But portions
Act 55 still remained intact, including an ex-
t=._mption for state-relaated universities, he said.

ski said. “They have remained within their
Oakland footprint and they haven’t engaged
in predatory acquisitions.” '

He said Pitt has cooperative relationships
with local and regional universities, unlike the
way UPMC interacts with West Penn Medical
Center.

Korinski summarized the differences by
saying, “Pitt isn’t trying to put CMU out of
business.”

Political opposition

Although Pitt appears relatively unscathed
by the push to question the tax—exempt status
of nonproﬁts in Allegheny County, political
opposition continues to mount against UPMC.

State Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny, ex-
pressed his support for the push to re-evaluate
UPMC’s status as a nonproﬁt institution. In
a press release from his ofﬁce, Frankel said
when institutions like UPMC act like “Fortune
500” companies, it calls into question their
status as purely public charities.

“Many of my constituents have asked me
the same question that Pittsburgh is asking
today —— is UPMC a somewhat public charity,
a mostly public charity or is it truly a purely
public charity, as our state constitution re-
quires,” Frankel said.

But UPMC claims to be thoroughly fulﬁll-

ing all parts of the HUP test. -

Paul Wood, vice president of public re-
lations and spokesman for UPMC, said in
an email that the pressure being placed on
the health care provider is little more than
politicians in Allegheny County and the city
of Pittsburgh attempting to appeal to their
constituents.

“The challenge to UPMC’s tax—exempt sta-

tus appears to be based on the mistaken im-' ,

pression that a nonproﬁt organization must
conduct its affairs in away that pleases certain
labor unions, certain favored businesses, or
particular political constituencies.” ”_ , ‘

He said that one of the key components

of the HUP test that UPMC undeniably fol-
lows is providing a service that otherwise"

the government would be obligated to fund.
Pennsylvania is the only large state in the na-
tion without public hospitals, and thereforfe,
hospitals like UPMC serve as the health care"
safety net for the poor and uninsured. A‘
Woodalso argues that UPMC operates free
from a private-proﬁt motive. He said operat-
ing free of private-proﬁt motive merely means
that any proﬁts generated should be invested
back into the community, rather than be used

A to reward or motivate individuals.

He said that being free of a private-proﬁt
motive does not mean that UPMC shouldnft

strive to maintain a positive operating margin,
because without that margin, organizations
would go out of business. It also doesn’t mean
that nonproﬁts shouldn’t compete vigorously
with other nonproﬁt institutions, because the
nation’s antitrust laws require just that. He
also said that employees and officers should
not be paid anything other than the compen-
sation pegged at market equivalents.

UPMC has contributed to the city in myri-
ad ways that are often overlooked, according
to Wood. It is the primary funder of the Pitts-
burgh Promise college scholarships awarded
to public high school graduates in the city.
Last year, the hospital provided $622 million
in community beneﬁts and $238 million for
IRS-deﬁned charity care, which more than

offsets the tax exemptions that havelbeen

extended to UPMC, says Wood.

’ Wood said that any new discriminatory
tax scheme would be detrimental to the re-
gional economy and economic competition.
UPMC pays real-estate taxes on 49 percent

\’ of the property they own, and the remaining
51 percent comprises hospital campuses that

are tax- exempt. .
They continue to operate as “institutions
of purely public charity” in every sense of

' the phrase, and they are unquestionably tax

exempt,” Wood said. I

OPINIONS

Pitt student group’s sweatshop protests lack imagination

Matt Schaff
Columnist

Dearest Mother and Father,

I’m writing to thank you for helping me
imbibe_ the fantasies that whirl around the
minds of Pitt administrators. I now can
safely put away my worries over the origins
of University apparel. ’

What brought me to this point was my
birthday gift, the state-of-the-art Dream
Explorer 3000, and I can’t express enough
appreciation for your generosity. Surely, it’s
taken some time to get the hang of it, but
after practicing I’m now able to don my 3-D
goggles, plug in the dream coordinates of
people I know and pal around with their ids
and demons till morning comes, all with the
ease of slicing butter. The Dream Explorer
has taken me to fantastical worlds, for sure,
but it at the same time has allowed me to
clear up confusion —— most notably the one

I’ve had with Pitt’s administration.
Remember when I was so stumped as

to why Pitt would feel “satisﬁed”.with its

dogged commitment to the Fair Labor

‘Association, the supposed human—rights

watchdog of the factories thatproduce Pitt
apparel? Remember how I scratched my

leader of academic thought and progress,

university to consider afliliating with the
uncompromised WorkerRights Consortium

plorer 3000. After t/raversingthe collective

conflicts of interest never hurt anyone.

head when Pitt dragged its feet for months
despite reasoned appeals from students
who cried foul at the FLA, given its funding
from and control by the very companies

it monitors (Nike, Adidas, etc.)? The fact‘

that the University of Pittsburgh, a world

dreamscape of Pitt administrators, I’ve seen
that, in truth, conﬂicts of interest never hurt
anyone. In full honesty, that bitter term,
ought to be renamed: Conﬂict of interest,
no; conﬂuence of interest, yes. If acting
unethically boosts your proﬁts, there’s no

one better to police you than yourself.

It was tough getting to the dreams of
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey and
Vice Chancellor G. Reynolds Clark, the two
administrators most visible in the nego-
tiationsg with students of Pitt’s chapter of
Americans for Informed Democracy. My
Dream Explorer requests had to ﬁrst break
through multiple layers of unconsciousness
imposed by the Office of Public Affairs. But
after ﬁnally grabbing my ticket stubs to the
dreams of Humphrey and Clark, I stood on

the precipice of a brave new world.

Occupying the Oval Ofﬁce in this world is
Kenneth Lay, beloved former CEO of Enron
who neither defrauded investors nor died
of infamy—induced heart attack in 2006.
On the back of unprecedented public trust,
Lay’s company, once devoted to only energy,
commodities and securities, has grown to
benevolently absorb all sectors of the econ-
omy. This is thanks to dutiful monitoring

by Arthur Andersen LLP, the well—respected
accounting ﬁrm that Enron paid to audit its
books while Andersen sold consulting prod-
ucts to Enron. While prosecutors outside of
the Humphrey— Clark dreamscape might call
it a conﬂict of interest, this dynamic did not
cause Andersen to overlook shadow com-
panies that might hide massive losses and
artiﬁcially inﬂate Enron stock value, which
today triples that of Apple stock.

Over on the legislative side of the Lay ad-
ministration, senators and representatives
only introduce spending bills if they own
stocks in the companies that the legislation
beneﬁts. Contrary from stiﬂing competi-

tion, the personal proﬁts that legislators
stand to gain are seen as enhancing their
ability to choose priorities, and no one is
treated unfairly.

Neitherdoes conﬂict of interest cause
concern for science and health care. In
the dreams of Humphrey and Clark, the
cumbersome academic system — publicly
funded dispassionate critique — has died,
replaced by an industry system in which
for-proﬁt companies pay academics to re-
search and physicians to practice. But who
gives them their paycheck couldn’t impact
the behavior of these professionals: The
research ﬁndings are just as trustworthy,
the drugs pushed on the patient are just as
safe and no one dies.

Talk of death and suffering brings us
back to the FLA: In the dream world, labor-

ers in textile factories happily avoid terrible
working conditions when the companies
that beneﬁt from those factories monitor
them. Given the companies’ effective veto
power over whether abuse charges get in-
vestigated, this “conﬂuence of interest” in
fact spurs nobility among the proﬁt-seekers,
who gladly diminish their bottom line by
responding to every charge.

Of course, the students of Pitt’s AID
chapter will tell you that the FLA ﬁnds
fewer abuses in the same factories than
does the WRC — a different monitoring
agency funded and directed by students and
universities — that the FLA doesn’t require
factories to recognize unions and that the
FLA praised China’s infamous Foxconn fac-
tories as an exemplar of humane industry
when third-party reports of widespread

5

abuses broke.

But they are only students. Personal-
ly, I ﬁnd myself more “satisﬁed” with the
dreaming of administrators ——— not know-
ing whether Pitt apparel came from abused
workers is surely more inspiring than know-
ing it did.

Sincerely,
Cornelius Schaff

Sadly, Cornelius’ Dream Explorer 3000
malﬁ.mctioned upon his discovery of the
true purposes of the Outside the Classroom
Curriculum, leaving him suspended in Dean
Humphrey’s dreamscape. Email his brother
Matt at matthew.schaff@gmail.com with

Aziz Ansari applies political themes to his comedy routines. MCT Campus

Andrew Gretchko
- Staﬁ’ Writer

There are few instructions given at a comedy
show —— among them are not to take pictures

I and not to interrupt the show. Moments after
making this clear to his audience, Aziz An-
sari was assaulted by a voice from the crowd,
Instead of throwing a ﬁt and storming off or
instructing security to escort the rowdy fan
out of Heinz Hall, Ansari took matters into
his own hands.

“There are 3,000 people here, and ev-
erybody knows that you are the shittiest one
here. I hate you, and I have your money,”
Ansari said, sending the crowd into a ﬁt of
laughter. ‘ ’

_ That’s Aziz Ansari —the successful ob- , ,

servational comedian who is unafraid to
take on any issue that comes his way, be it
race, masturbation or someone interrupt-
ing his show with a yell. But while many
may scorn his use of curse words or balk
at his obscene gestures, there wasvmore to
Ansari’s “Buried Alive” comedy tour show
than simple-minded crude humor. This was

. sociopolitical commentary with a punch line.

With his 30th birthday approaching,
Ansari started his set with a debate on the
proper time to settle down and start a fam-
ily. While most college kids can’t relate to
this topic just yet, almost everyone has seen
or at least heard of the MTV show “16 and
Pregnant.” ‘

ANSARI

Using the depressing program to show
just how out of whack our culture has be-

come, Ansari compared the addictive, yet
saddening, series with MTV’s “Super Sweet
16,” which portrays spoiled American youth
complaining about the colo_r of their brand-
new fully—'loaded car. A

Throwing his head back in a ﬁt of nearly
maniacal laughter, Ansari replicated one of
the manylphone calls he’s had with friends
who havenotiﬁed him of their intent to have
children. Many would congratulate their
buddies, but Ansari only laughed, perceiving
their life-changing decision to be a terrible
mistake.

Using audience participation, Ansari took
his argument one step further. “Clap if you
knew each other for ﬁve years before you
got married,” he said, as thunder spread
throughout the theater. As Ansari gradually
lowered the length of pre—marriage court-
ship, the applause decreased.

After asking for all of those who had
known each other for less than two years
to clap, Ansari erupted into laughter of his
own. “You’re all getting divorced,” he said,
prompting another outburst from the crowd
that, instead of being insulted by the com-
ment, took Ansari’s criticisms with a smile.

For Ansari, marriage boils down to tax
purposes, offering little incentive other than
government tax breaks. Though most in the
crowd might disagree, it was Ansari’s insen-
sitive, straightforward outlook on life that

they had paid to see. His lecture on society
was just the beginning.
After relaying the experiences of his lat-

{pared the style of marriage inthe two coun-

tries. Ansari then informed the crowd that

common practice in parts of India —— may
not initially be as happy as those who chose
their partner, arranged marriages end up
beingshappier in the long-run’. I

 I These segments of Ansari’s show still
brought laughter to the crowd, as Ansari
made sure to throw in his witty humor when-
ever possible, but the pointshe made were
far from laughable. “I feel bad making broad
generalizations about men and women like
that — but I’m right,” he said.

Yes, Ansari made use of plenty of ste-_
reotypes throughout the show along with
an onslaught of jokes about male genitalia
—- a combination that has often led people
to take comedy less seriously. However, he
was able to prove his intelligence and skill as
a comedian by turning the negativity usually
placed on such actions to provoke thought.

“I’m very pro-gay marriage  but I’m also
very pro—delicious chicken sandwich,” he
said, touching on the hotly debated Chick-
ﬁl-A scandal that covered national headlines
this summer. The crowd may have had its
own opinion on the subject, but during Ansa-
ri’s time onstage, the issue was used to bring
the audience together, rather than apart.

oriented restaurant hopes to encourage
among its customers.

“You can’t judge a population by its lead-
ers,” Sayre said, referring to the inaccurate
perceptions that customers might have of
the countries Conﬂict Kitchen represents.

Conﬂict Kitchen’s management hopes

‘ to draw attention to the day-to-day life of
' ' citizens in the countries that it highlights.

“The focus of the project is on the
people,” Sayre said, “not the politics or
governments.”

While the exotic menu items might
intimidate those hesitant to leave their

comfort zones, Sayre described food as
universal and a comfortable way to ap-
proach a new culture. Most items on the
menu come either wrapped in or alongside
an informative text or ﬁrst-person inter-
view with a citizen of the Conﬂict Kitchen’s
highlighted country.

Each time the owners prepare to adjust
the restaurant’s focus to a new country, the

cooks must research the native food and _
culture, immersing themselves in back- .

ground information. They then branch out
to_members of that culture here in Pitts—
burgh who help them to set up contacts
abroad.

“I think collaboration is incredibly im-
portant to the process,” said Dawn Weleski,
another one of the Conﬂict Kitchen’s found-

ers, during an interview on The Pitt News’
show on WPTS. “Throughout each of our
iterations, we make sure that we have col-
laborators that we’re working closely with
in Pittsburgh and in the country that we’re
concentrating on.”

While Conﬂict Kitchen’s current menu
features authentic Iranian cuisine, its or-
ganizers hope to bring North Korean food
to Oakland’s Schenley Plaza soon.

As of now, the Conﬂict Kitchen’s crew
plans to travel to South Korea in August
to meet with North Korean refugees and
conduct food research. These face-to—face
interactions allow for more direct informa-
tion and a better product. Sayre said that
while the crew formally conducted food
research on a trip to. Cuba, some of the

@wedopittevents

» best information and tips they received

were from ordinary people they ran into
on the street informally. The crew always
attempts to experience a country’s food
ﬁrsthand before bringing it to Pittsburgh,
but in some cases, such as North Korea and
Iran, ﬁeld research is not feasible.

As for the present local angle, there
are currently talks between the Conﬂict
Kitchen and the Carnegie Library of Pitts-
burgh about the possibility of creating a

resource center on each country showcased

at Conﬂict Kitchen. Although nothing is yet
set in stone, the restaurant’s management
said such a potential collaboration would
provide restaurant-goers interested in the
country’s people and culture an additional
way to broaden’ their perspectives.

Conﬂict Kitchen has conducted a range .

of programming in the past, from Skyp-
ing over meals with citizens in Tehran to
cultural festivals and large group meals.
The restuarant’s organizers hope to use
their experience with coordinating events
of this sort as the infrastructure for future
projects.

Rubin is optimistic that the Schenley
Plaza venue will see many returning cus-
tomers, musing that Conﬂict Kitchen’s food
will be better than a lot of what plaza—goers
have tasted before and expressing enthu-
siasm_regarding the restaurant’s future
experiments to engage the public.

“I don’t want to announce any speciﬁcs
just yet, but we’ve got some more creative,
performance—related projects we’re going
to be doing in the park,” he said. I

Youthful Panthers win one of three on the road in Chicago

Dave Uhrmacher
Stqzff Wr2'ter

It is not often that an up-and—coming Big
East team has to rely on a group of under-
classmen to lift itself to victory.

But that’s exactly what the Pitt softball
team has done time and again this sea-
son. And over the weekend, it was a trio
of sophomores leading the way for Pitt.

The Panthers traveled to Chicago for a
three—game set with the DePaul Blue De-
mons (18-13, 5-1 Big East), and, after split-
ting a doubleheader on Friday, Pitt (14-15,
3-3 Big East) dropped the rubber game of
the series on Saturday by a score of4—1.

Although the Panthers didn’t end up
victorious this weekend, the tough con-
tests and one victory against DePaul al-
lowed the young nucleus to continue to
gain experience. The team has just one
senior and onejunior on its roster.

Pitcher Alexa Larkin dominated the
DePaul lineup in game one on Friday,
completing all seven innings while only
allowing two hits. - .

DePaul starting pitcher Kirsten Verdun

nearly matched Larkin’s performance, also -

throwing seven innings and surrender-
ing only ﬁve hits. She struck out 10 Pitt
batters.

Verdun’s outing was spoiled, much to

the Blue Demons’ chagrin, by a pair of

ﬁrst—inning runs courtesy of back-to —back M

doubles from sophomores Carissa Throck-
morton and Kaila Balatgek.

Throckmorton, who led Pitt with two
hits in the first game, recalled the go-
ahead hit after the game.

“I was just looking for a pitch to drive
and get the run_ in,” the third baseman
said. “I was trying not to guess and just
made sure it was there, and I got the bat
on the ball.”

The pair of ﬁrst—inning runs would
prove to be all the run support Larkin
would need for the rest of the game. 

She continued her dominance of Big
East competition this spring as she im-
proved to 3-0 with a 1.72 ERA in confer-
ence play.

“I did not have that successful of a pre-
season, so coming into Big East play, I
really knew what approach I wanted to
take and how to be a leader for my team-
mates,” Larkin said. “Things like hitting
good spots with my fastball and staying
off the middle of the plate have been im-
portant.”

The budding star explained the Pan—’‘

thers’ ability to battle despite their lack
of collegiate experience.

A GRAIN OF SAUL

Ware’s  inspires Louisville to Elite Eight victory over Duke

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff « Wrz'ter

Louisville basketball player Kevin Ware suf-
fered the worst sports injury in live televi-
sion history on Sunday,‘ and I am going to
remember it for the rest, of my life.

it was a ﬁrst for me, seeing someone’s
bone pierce through his or her, skin. I was
alone when it happened, no roommates
to scream with and no fellow sports fans
also in shock, just the iconic voice of an-
nouncer Jim Nantz and the silence of my
family room.

Perhaps What shocked me most was the
strikingly ordinary play on which it hap-
pened. Ware didn’t go up and have his legs
swept out from under him. He didn’t even
get hit below the knees. With 6:33 to go in

the ﬁrst half, he simply defended a three- ,

point shot, extended his body, hit the ﬂoor
and crumbled. , .

help him up, until he saw the bone.

Players sitting on the bench saw it at eye
level because of the elevated court in Lucas
Oil Stadium. Reports broke that some of
them immediately vomited. Chane Behanan,
Wayne Blackshear and Montrezl Harrell all
collapsed to the ﬂoor. Duke players turned
away and couldn’t look. CBS showed the
replay once and then cut it. Pitino cried.

And then, after a grueling ﬁfteen minutes
during which nobody could ﬁnd the right
thing to say and the Louisville medical staff
put Ware on a stretcher, we were supposed
to get back to basketball.

If it weren’t for Ware, we probably never
would have gotten back to it.

That’s because the sophomore guard
from Atlanta, Ga., just kept telling his team
to win the game. Over and over again, with
his bone sticking six inches out of his leg, all
Ware could do was urge his teammates on.

“I’m OK. Win the game,” Ware repeated
to Pitino.

 

According to an ESPN report, when play
was set to resume, ofﬁcial Scott Thornley
paused next to junior guard Russ Smith and
asked, “Are you OK?”

At ﬁrst, it would seem the answer was no.

Louisville would miss four of its next ﬁve
shots along with two free throws, looking
disorganized and shaken by what had just
happened.

But somehow, for Smith and the rest of
the Louisville team, the ultimate response
was a resounding yes. ‘

After a timeout, the Cardinals came out
on a 12-6 run and recaptured the lead, head-
ing into halftime up 35-32.

The next time the Cardinals took the
ﬂoor, they looked like a team inspired be-
yond words. They shook off their emotions

early in the second half, blowing up for a
13-2 run for which Duke had absolutely no
response.

The run was led by Peyton Siva, who
scored seven of the 13 points and then con-
tinued to distribute the ball to ﬁnish with 16
points and four assists on the night.

Without question, the Cardinals’ in-
spired defense and unrivaled intensity was
a product of Ware’s injury. They all wanted
to bring him back home for the Final Four
— set to take place in Atlanta —— and there
was no group of opposing basketball players
that was going to stop them.

During a two-hour operation on Monday,
Ware’s leg was reset by surgeons and a rod
was inserted into his right tibia. While the
team is gearing up for a Final Four show-

down against Wichita State on Saturday,
Ware will begin a rehabilitation process
on which few athletes have had to embark.

One of them, former Washington Red-
skins quarterbackjoe Theismann, reached
out to Ware on Monday. Theismann broke ..
his leg on Monday Night Football in 1985
during a game against the New York Giants,
an incident that had previously held the title
of the most disturbing injury on TV until
Ware’s took place this week.

After offering some of his own perspec-
tive, Theismann remained optimistic, say-Q
ing that the guard will “be right back on the
court a year from now.”

But for now, the Cardinals will just have
to play for Ware and not with him. If Sunday
was any indication, they’ll be just ﬁne. g

“We know we are young, but we have a
lot of talent and potential,” she said. “And
you know, when we are down, we really
come together and rally and just continue
to trust ourselves.”

Coach Holly Aprile echoed the thoughts
of her student—athletes over the phone on
Monday. .

“I expect them to perform to the highest
level and have success,” said Aprile. “The
youth does not really factor into it. Mis-
takes may be attributed to [inexperience],
but it does not have much of an impact on
what I expect from the team.”

Aprile — in her ﬁfth year as the Pan-
thers’ head coach — also elaborated on
the expectations that go along with having
such a young roster.

“There is going to be some deficits
due to inexperience,” she said. “We knew
that from the beginning. We have a young
roster and there is an awareness of some
concerns on the defensive side, but we are
very talented. The relative inexperience is
not something I dwell on.”

The Panthers return home for five
games this week, all of them being played
in the Pittsburgh area. They travel to Rob-
ert Morris University for a midweek dou-
bleheader on Wednesday evening, with
the games slated to begin at 3 and 5 p.m.

“RMU is tough. They have a couple of
good left-handed pitchers and play well
defensively,” Aprile said. “We have to’ be
prepared to play.”

Following the nonconference set dur-
ing the week, the Panthers return home
over the weekend for a three-game series
against their Big East foe, University of
South Florida. a

The Panthers’ upcoming ﬁve—game
homestand concludes on April 10, with
another Wednesday—evening doubleheader
against in—state rival Penn State.

“[South Florida] went to the College
World Series last year. They have an out-
standing pitching staff, so' all ﬁve games
will be tough, and we need to be ready to
be better — better at the plate -— and just
continue to set the tone on the mound,”
said Aprile. H
