Students Gear Up
.. For Hart Campaign

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Presidential candidate Gary
Hart's campaign was officially
opened on Pitt's campus last night
when several students held an organ-
izational meeting to recruit
members for his I984 bid.

The meeting was attended by four
students who have formed the begin-
nings of a group entitled Pitt Stu-
dents for Gary Hart. The group
discussed various strategies to get
other students involved in the cam-
paign in general and to eventually
persuade students to vote for Hart
next November.

Hart has been Colorado‘s senior
senator since I975 and is one of the
few Western Democratic senatorsto
be re-elected in the Republican
sweep of I980. His three main areas
of his election focus on the economy,
national security and energy.

Bruce Ledewitz, a member of
Western Pennsylvanians for Hart
and an associate professor of law at
Duquesne University, talked to the
group and advised them on how to
run the membership drive.

Deployment

The most important thing for the
students to do from the start is to
establish name recognition. He said
recent polls have shown that only 25
percent of Americans recognize
Hart as a I984 presidential candi-
date. He said only about 70 percent
recognize Walter Mondale’s name
and he was once the vice-president.

“You should start with the most
politically-aware people and then
work your way down to the average
student." Ledewitz said. “You want
then“. to know who he is at first, and
then you can discuss his policies."

Student Government Board
member Mindy Goldberg, one ofthe
co—foundcrs of the group, said name
recognition is a definite problem.
She said she was wearing a Gary
Hart button one day. and a fellow
student on the elevator asked her if
he was running for SGB president.

Ledewitz said a good way to
establish that name recognition
would be for the group to set up
tables in places students frequent
most, such as Thackery Hall during
class registration and add/drop. An

U.S. State Official Says

By MICHAEL WEINMAN

“We are now at one of the most
criticaljunctions in world security,"
said Deputy Director of the Office of
Politico-Military Affairs for the
U.S. State Department Dr.Robert
Dean.

Dean defended President Rea-
gan‘s nuclear policy following a
flurry of public debate at the final
presentation of last week's Confer-
ence on Intermediate Range Nuclear
Forces. The conference, held in
Forbes Quadrangle, was sponsored
by the Colloquium on Security in an
Interdependent World. The Collo-
quium is funded, in part, by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and Westinghouse Electric,
which is also involved in nuclear
weapons production.

Despite recent

nuclear demonstrations, Dean said
NATO is not losing its effectiveness.
“One can't discuss nuclear forces
without discussing NATO," Dean
said. '

Dean admitted that people have
been predicting the death of NATO
for almost 30 years but added that
the very evidence used by the
“doom-sayers” is the best testament
for the survival of NATO. He said
NATO continues to survive despite
past U.S. opposition to Britain and
Frances invasion of Egypt in 1956
and France’s withdrawal from
NATO’s military command in I966.

“It is the continuity and resiliency
of the Alliance that guarantees its
future,” Dean said.

Dean called on the people of the
U.S. to support the German govern-
ment in its request for cruise and
Pershing II missiles. Dean said the
Reagan Administration may have
delayed missile delivery but will go
through with its deployment despite
public opposition.

36 Years

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Leo Bemis has influenced
many throughout his 36 years of
allegiance to the University of
Pittsburgh.

His career as physical educa-
tion instructor, intramural direc-
tor and soccer coach at Pitt
began in I947, and with the
recent conclusion of the I983
soccer season, Bemis decided to
retire. '

Yesterday, during the lun-
cheon held at the William Pitt
Union honoring Bemis, there
wasn‘t once the mention of a
record or statistics but many
mentions of what this man
represents.

After being appointed intra-
mural director in I947, Bemis
promoted soccer as a club sport
in I952, when the demands of
those in the intramural program
increased.

By I954, Pitt, aided by Bemis,
had soccer as a varsity sport.
Since that time, Bemis and the
program he built have
flourished.

Probably the individual who
experienced and learned more
from Bemis than any other at
Pitt is baseball coach Bobby
Lewis.

“I would have to describe Leo
Bemis as one of the most opti-
mistic persons I have ever
known," he said. “He is a perse-
vering individual who would
never accept ‘It can’t be done.’
Leo, in some way, would get it
done.

‘I h to
Leo Bemis K°b' p O

“I have known Leo Bemis as a
conscientious, dependable
teacher, intramural director and
coach. but most of all, I grew to
respect and admire Leo Bemis
the man."

The others and their messages
carried with them great esteem
for a man who has become a Pitt
legend. .

“When Leo arrived at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, he had no
scholarships. no equipment and
no fields to play on," Dr. Karl
Oermann, retired long-time
chairman of the physical educa-
tion department, said, “It took
him about six years (I947-53) to
get soccer underway. He stayed
with it, and it was soon a varsity
sport. We [the university] owe a
great debt to this man.”

“I have learned many very val-
uable things from Leo,” Dr. Carl
Peterson, retired former director
of the physical education’s basic
instruction department, said.
“As teachers, we often become so
enthralled with our subject mat-
ter that we forget we are teachers
of students. Leo never forgot
that.

“I've always been very proud
to have you [Bemis] as a member
of the staff for so many years. I

hope you'll remember us all
because we'll be thinking of
you."

“I will never forget the

strength in silence of Leo," Lou
Fabian, current co-intramural
director, said.

Master of ceremonies Ken
Metz, the chairman of the physi-
cal education department, then
asked Bemis to speak.

In his soft spoken manner, he
began.

“It has been a real pleasure
spending 36 of my years here," he
said. “It's been a labor of love.
The associations with all the fine
people that I have worked with
—— it has been an experience most
enjoyable.

“I have always looked to
retirement in much the same way
a runner does the ‘walI’[the hard-
est part] in a marathon. You’re
going to have to get to it some
time. And you have to go
through it. It’sjust another chal-
lenge in life.

“It [my time at Pitt] has been a
pleasure, that I’ll never forget."

More Women Learn Law At Pitt

By CHERYL SIRKO

.Women’s total enrollment in
Pitt's law school is up and so are
career opportumtes.

Admissions show women make
up 4| percent of all law students
enrolled at Pitt, and in the last gra-
duating class, the top three gradu-
ates were women.

“A woman student with superior
grades has all the opportunities men
do,” Pitt law schools placement
director Susan Fletcher said. “They
are clerks for judges and work for
large law firms and corporations -
there are no areas barred to them."

Statistics from other law schools
also show an increase in women's
enrollment. Columbia University's
law school admissions statistics
reveal that women comprise 37 per-
cent of the total enrollment, and
Harvard‘s figures show that women
are 34 percent of the total.

“It is true that nationwide enroll-
ment is up...and the swell is because
women and minorities are entering
the profession. The real [total]
enrollment would actually be level-
ing off if it weren't for them[minori-
ties and women],” Fletcher said.

Many women are attracted to law
because of the opportunities it pro-
vides, according to Pitt law school
admissions director Fredi
Dansinger.

“Returning women [who have fin-
ished college but opted for other
work] now have this opportunity
open to them.” Dansinger said.

One law student, who declined to
be identified, over 35 years old, said
she wanted to be a lawyer since she
was eight years old. This year was

g~;r.l.1

 

her first opportunity to attend law
school.

“The recent graduates see law as
an opportunity to excel," Dansinger
said.

Fletcher said law is attractive for
the same reason the liberal arts and
the humanities are attractive.

“It [law] offers a challenge — a
sort of mental gymnastics. It is a

nationwide enrol-
Iment is up...and

cause women and
minorities are

fession.’

discipline that requires rigorous
training,“ Fletcher said.

Fletcher also attributed students
increased interest in law to a desire
to be in a field where they can affect
changes. .

Women want to have careers in
branches where they can work on
what they feel strongly about and
follow their consciences, according
to Fletcher. She said many law stu-
dents are willing to work in consu-
mer or environmental law for less
pay, but the career opportunities

I there are lacking.

Discimination against women in
hiring is also not the problem it was
in the past, according to Dansinger.
She said law firms are more inter-
ested today in academic
achievement.

“Sex is not the deciding factor,”
Dansinger explained. “When
women come back [to school], they
finish at the top of their class, and
that is what interests ﬁrms. It is
because of their performance, and so
their chances of succeeding are
better."

Jeanne McQuilken, a Harvard
law student and member of the
Women’s Law Assocation in Bos-
ton, said she expects to get a job as
readily as any man.

“In law, there's a great respect for
what you know and what you've
learned. There is a respect for
knowledge, no matter what your
sex," McQuilken said.

Pittsburgh attorney Joanna Ross
Wilder said she is not looking for the
increased enrollment of women in
law schools to downgrade the pro-
fession in the long run, as has hap-
pened in the case of nursing and
teaching.

“If anything, more women law-
yers will upgrade the profession,”
Wilder said. She said many Ameri-
cans who want equal justice under
the law and think there is no better
place to begin than in the law profes-
sion itself.

Although most see increased
career opportunities for /women in
law, Wilder cautioned against
assuming that women will make upa
great percentage of the practicing

lawyers. W _

U.S. was operating under a period of
good will, the Soviets were dramati-
cally increasing their nuclear arse-

nal. He presented statistics that
revealed the Soviet Union's nuclear
expenditures at l40 billion dollars a
year more compared to the U.S.

“The Soviet invasion of Afghani-
stan and the crushing of Solidarity
point out the true nature of the
Soviet Union,” he said.

The military has gained control of
the Soviet government and now
poses a greater danger to the U.S.
than ever before, Dean claimed,
adding that the U.S. cannot allow
the current anti-nuclear trends to
delay U.S. nuclear weapons
deployment.

Dean also claims Warsaw‘ Pact
forces are offensive and not defen-
sive, as he says NATO forces are.

“The Soviet Union would use
their conventional (non-nuclear)
arms to begin any military offenses
and back them up with their nuclear
capability," he explained. This, he
added, is one reason for the testing
of nuclear and gas detoxification
trucks during the fighting in
Afghanistan.

deployed in Europe is below West

ern capabilities, according to Dean.
He maintained that 85 percent of
Soviet nuclear forces are less than
five years old compared with the

average age of NATO‘s nuclear wea-
pons — which he said is l5 to 20
years. Dean admitted, however, that
the Soviet Union has weapons
deployed on two fronts instead of
the one-front NATO deployment.

Dean said a Soviet nuclear advan-
tage will not result from an actual
use of nuclear missiles,but rather
from Western impotence in contain-
ing Soviet expansion. He added that
the development of Soviet nuclear
superiority or even parady with the
U.S., could encourage a Soviet
attack without fear of an effective
Western reprisal.

Nuclear weapons in warfare are
no longer considered an alternative
to conventional methods, as deve-
loped through the Massive Retalia-
tion policy of former president
Dwight Eisenhower. The role of
nuclear weapons in modern policy is
to deter nuclear warfare through the
threat of Mutual Assured Destruc-
tion. Dean said if the Soviets do not
perceive the U.S.’s nuclear power to
be greater than the Warsaw Pact’s,
then the Soviets won’t put any credi-
bility in U.S. threats.

In order to prevent the Soviets
from believing that a nuclear war is

winable, Dean said he believes there
must be continued East-West nego-
tiations that will lead to an arms
limitation with three key elements.

“Its [the arms agreement’s] main
intent must be world, not just
national, security...it must be bal-
anced to keep the Soviets from get-
ting a feeling of superiority...it must
reduce the likelihood of a military
threat," he explained.

“The U.S. has adopted a rational
and ﬂexible approach to negotia-
tions,” Dean said. “The Soviets
however, have not joined us." Dean
added that the Soviets are trying to
pit nuclear nations against non-
nuclear nations with the hopes of
halting European support for Amer-
ican missiles.

“We must see this for what it is [a
political ploy]“ Dean said. “Deploy-
ment can be halted or even reversed
but should not be done so for Euro-
pean political expediency."

Gets Medicine Award

By weuov SHARKEY
And MARTY WILLIS

Dr. Solomon H. Snyder, who
recently won the prestigious
Dickson Prize in Medicine
awarded annually by Pitt's
School of Medicine, yesterday
extended his gratitude tothe uni-
versity for his selection.

“lt‘s a nice honor. A number of
very distinguished scientists have
received the award. I’m very
grateful to the University of
Pittsburgh," Snyder said yester-
day in a telephone interview
from his Baltimore office.

Snyder, a professor of neuro-
science, pharmacology and psy-
chiatry, is also the director ofthe
department of neuroscience at
Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine. He received
the $20,000 award and a medal of
scholarship for his research and
clarification ofthe functioning of
neural receptors in the brain.

Snyder’s research has helped
to pioneer new techniques for
measuring the effects of various
drugs on receptor mechanisms.
“Its an important prize because
it recognizes distinguished
work," he said. He added that
since the inception of the Dick-
son Prize in 1970, five ofits recip-
ients have gone on to win the
Nobel Prize in Medicine.

Randi Klemm, assistant to the
dean of Pitt‘s School of medi-
cine, said that the prize is given to
the American scientist who has
made the most significant contri-
bution to any branch of medicine
during that particular year.

The winner is selected from a
group of nominees by a faculty

committee which is formed every
January to choose that year’s
recipient, Klemm said. “The
committee is comprised of the
most distinguished scientists
here at Pitt. lt’s one of the most
prestigious awards given by the
university," she explained. To be
nominated, a scientist must be a
U.S. citizen who has conducted
his research in the U.S. during
that year.

Snyder has received several
other awards for his contribu-
tions to medicine, including the
American Psychiatric Associa-
tion‘s Hofheimer Award, the
Wolf Prize in Medicine and the
Albert Lasker Basic Medical
Research Award.

Snyder said the $20,000 is a
relatively high sum in compari-
son to most prizes he has won.
He said he has not decided yet
how he will spend the money.
Snyder was notified last summer
that he had been selected to
receive the Dickson, but it was
not until Nov. 2 that he came to
Pitt for the formal presentation
ceremony. Klemm said the Dick-
son recipient, as well as the other
nominees, are traditionally
invited to return to Pitt as guest
lecturers.

The Dickson Prize was estab-
lished in l970 by the estates of
the late Joseph Z. Dickson, an
alumnus of Pitt’s School of Med-
icine, and his wife, Agnes Fischer
Dickson. Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity awards the Dickson Prize
in Science, honoring the
researcher who has made the
most significant contribution to
scholarly progress in science
each year.

Lupus _is_a disease that affects
500,000 victims for their entire lives
—- 20-year-olds suffering from the
disease feel like old. aging people.
Taking drugs and going to the doc-
tor s become part of their daily rou-
tines. In some cases, the disease is
fatal.

According to Ann Metzger. presi-
dent of the Western Pennsylvania
Chapter of the Lupus Foundation,
lupus is a disease that attacks the
body's immune system. The symp-
toms include a skin rash and arthri-
tis in variousjoints. unusual fatigue
and an increased vulnerability to
infections and viruses.

Victims with complex lupus prob-
lems have their vital organs, like the
kidneys and lining of the heart,
attacked by the disease.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 23. 1933

Cindy (not her real name) is a 22-
year-old graduate from Carnegie-
Mellon University and a lupus
victim. A former All-America bas-
ketball player, she has been trying to
keep the disease a secret from her
close friends and relatives for over a
year.

“I always feel so tired," she said.
“Its been hard feeling so old when I
was so active.“

Because of the severity of her case,
she must perform kidney dialysis at
home every day.

“It's the same thing Gary Cole-
man is doing,“ she said with a laugh.

Victims who are diagnosed early
have a 90 percent chance of being
alive for the next I0 years and then a
better life expectancy than the gen-
eral public, Metzger said. She
believes the higher expectancy is due
to extra precautions the victim

.LupiJs.' A Life-long Disease

takes.

While researchers are still trying
to determine the exact response of
the immune system to the disease, it
is known that the immune system
affected by lupus forms antibodies
against itself.

The disease affects more women
than men. especially during the
childbearing years ofl6 through 50.
Black women in particular have a
higher chance of acquiring the
disease.

If a woman has lupus while preg-
nant, it is possible for her to have no
further complications except an epi-
sode following delivery.

People with low-crisis lupus may
be treated with steroids and aspirin
as an anti-inﬂammatory, and pred-
nisone is given to people with com-
plex cases.

lWomen Find More
Law Opportunities

continued from page one

"Women have traditionally been
shunted from law. This is continuing
today.“ Wilder said. McQuilken
also said she believes there are, to a
certain extent, fewer opportunities
for women in business. medicine and
law.

Dansinger maintains that there
are room for the best, and to be the
best, she said women must work
hard.

According to Dansinger, another
reason women are enrolling in law
school is because they are usually so
committed that they are able to be a
parent and continue to have children

while they study law.

“Women also aren't any less able
to be mobile [than men]. Husbands
are often willing to relocate to help
their wives‘ careers,” Dansinger
said.

Fletcher admitted some women
do come up against inappropriate
questions in job interviews —— ques-
tions concerning family details. She
said these questions try to discover
how long the woman will be with the
firm and if she has family responsi-
bilities that could demand more of
her time.

'“Women, however. are becoming
more ﬂexible in this," Dansinger
said.

Although Ledewitz admits that
the Hart campaign “has a long way
to go,” he said several events within
the past month have boosted the
campaign somewhat.

For example, congressional dis-
tricts all over the country held fund-
raising parties for the campaign; the
polls coming out of New Hampshire
(the first_primary in I984) show that

Ledewitz said ‘Hart's appeal to
college students and young people is
due, in part, to both his physical age
(47) and his ideological age.

“He‘s the only candidate running
who is not old enough to be the
grandfather of anyone at ,Pitt,” he
said. “His ideas are young. He has
ideas for the l980s and cares about

Thanks

As the spirit of the Thanksgiving holiday
approaches, The Pitt News would like to take this time
to sit down and evaluate the events and people that
shaped the past year. Some of the things are sincere
and heartfelt while others are based on speculations of
what could have been if only the circumstances had
been different.

Sincere thanks go to the following:

GT0 ABC television for showing the American
public what would and could happen to our country if
a nuclear war did occur. Sunday night’s presentation
of “The Day After” definitely opened some minds that
were previously closed to the fear and devasta_ti0n of
nuclear war.

GTO Foge Fazio and the 1983 Panthers for yet
another exciting football season.

GTO those students who organized and participated
in the invasion of a traffic island on Forbes Avenue
last week mocking the U.S. invasion of Grenada. The
former invasion mimicked the ridiculousness of the
latter.

GT0 the university for putting the time and care into
renovating the student union into something of which
students can be proud.

And now for those people and things that do not
deserve our thanks:

GT0 the referees at Saturday’s Pitt-Penn State game
for allowing the Joe Paterno Fifth Quarter to be
played. '

GT0 the university for stripping away the nostalgia
of the Schenley name by renaming the student union
the William Pitt Union.

GT0 the Student Government Board for proving
how effective and hardworking therepresentatives of
the undergraduate population can be if they really try.

GT0 the City of Pittsburgh for installing a sticker
program in South Oakland, thereby stealing valuable
parking places from commuters who have as much
right to park there as residents.

GT0 Sheetz, Stop-n-Go and the Tuck Shop for truly
making Oakland the fast food and convenience store
capital of the world.

GT0 SGB and the Pitt Program Council for not
bringing Gary Hart to Pitt and depriving Pitt students
of a valuable education of the democratic system of
our country.

GT0 the Schenley Cafe for charging l9 cents per
ounce on its salad bar.

GT0 President Reagan for his brilliant foreign policy
that cost over 200 Americans their lives in Lebanon.

GTO Greyhound Bus Lines and the Grand Con-
course Restaurant for being so supportive during their
employees’ strike and proving to us that labor does
have a voice in this country.

GT0 NBC Television for cancelling one of the better
TV news shows in a long time — “Overnight."

GT0 those congressmen who defeated the Equal
Rights Amendment before it even had a chance to be
revitalized, thereby proving that all men are created
equal

Happy Thanksgiving!

Letters To The Editor

After three hours
recruiting in the Towers Lobby,
three members of Steel City Rugby
Club and I managed to sign up a
total of 68 male rugby enthusiasts to
join our club. It has come to my
notice that the University of Pitts-
burgh provides facilities for female
rugby players — atalented group
who have proved themselves to be
ranked among the top female rugby
teams in the state.

I am a freshman student from Ire-
land who has played rugby since the
age of four and hoped to pursue my
interest in this sport with Pitt’s
athletic. program. After investigat-
ing why there is_no rugby team pres-
ently active at Pitt, I learned that due
to an unfortunate incident that took
place two years ago, the entire affili-
ation with men's rugby has been
dropped.

I grant that this incident, putting
it mildly, was not exactly an honor
to Pitt's sporting reputation, but to
blacklist an entire sport is hardly
sportsman-like either.

It seems that Americans think
that rugby is a chaotic version of
football played by educated rough-

of casual '

necks intent on beating each others’
brains out then drinking themselves
under the table afterwards.

How naive this view isll In Ire-
land, as well as in England, South
Africa, New Zealand, Scotland,
Wales and France, rugby is a major
national sport. So surely, rugby has
more to offer than chaos and beer-
swillir_ig antics.

Rugby is, in my opinion, the most
comprehensive sport available to
mankind. Unlike other spor_ts, it
requires a lot more of each partici-
pant than one or two specialized
skills. Not that I mean to offend any
runners or swimmers by using them
as an example, but all I feel , is
required of those are strong limbs
and the ability to follow one’s nose.
Granted, a rugby player must have
strong limbs and the ability to follow
his nose also, but rugby also involves
the ability to judge and time cor-
rectly the plays and moves of the
opposition.

Anticipation is very much the
name of the game. Each player must
be capable of continuous running,
skillful handling, accurate kicking
and effective tackling, all without
the use of protective equipment.

Bad Past Stifles Rugby Player I

Dear Editor:

Even so, the incidence of serious
injury among rugby players is far
lower than football. The game is also
a popular spectator sport as it is a
continuous game — without downs,
requiring full concentration for all
of each 40-minute half.

Since Pitt no longer sponsors its

interest in rugby players, the team is ‘

currently operating under the
banner of Steel City Rugby, which
has been accepted as a member of
the United States of America Rugby
Football Union.

Our first U nion match was against
Wheeling, W. Va., which we won
conclusively 29-0. We followed this
trend with only one game to play
and within the Union, we are 4-0.

The Steel City team is a dedicated
and enthusiastic group whose tal-
ented individuals are, for the most
part, Pitt students. Why not forge‘
the past unfortunate incident and re-
establish the team within Pitts
athletic program. Let us make Pitta
part of rugby and rugby 3 P3“ °f
Pitt!!

Private Rights Cannot Discriminate

Dear Editor:

Upholding private rights is an
important element of our national
philosophy, but can we afford to be
discriminatory in whose rights we
uphold?

The editorial “Ethical Questions"
in the Nov. 2| issue of The Pitt News
speaks of two cases of infanticide,
one successful, the other not yet. The
first case, that of “Infant Doe“ of
Bloomington, lnd., involved a boy
born in April, I982.

The child was born with Down‘s
syndrome, a genetic defect usually
involving mental retardation of one
degree or another and a blockage of
the digestive system that would
require a serious but usually success-
ful operation to correct. The parents
chose to withhold surgery. The Indi-
ana courts upheld the parents’ deci-
sion, refusing to order the operation.
The baby starved to death six days
later.

The second case, that of “Baby
Jane Doe" in New York, has fortu-

nately not proved fatal yet. “Baby
Jane Doe" was born about a month
and a half ago with spina bifida (an
open spine) and with water on the
brain, among other things.

‘Her parents also have chosen to
withhold corrective surgery. Defi-
nite facts on this case are not known
b¢C3US€. as was written, the
Supreme Court blocked the Reagan
Ad ministration's attempts to see the
child's medical records, but it is
known that if the pressure on the
girl s brain is not relieved soon
through surgery, severe brain dam-
age will result. It IS also known that
if the child's spine is not closed she
will die within two years. If she does
receive this surgery, she may ﬁve 20
years or more.

_ Y0“ -"3PP1_aud the courts‘ deci-
§>l0f_1S Upholding private rights and
etti.n_g individuals make their own
decisions." Unfortunately, these
decisions actually do the reverse, by
eliminating the rights of the people
most directly inﬂuenced by the deci-

sions ~— the children. Perhaps one
can argue that an unborn child is not
human, and therefore has no rights.
but who will say that once he has
been born, he still is not human?

And once he has been born, as an
American citizen, does he not have
the basic right to life, guaranteed
him in the Constitution? We canriot
take that right away from him
because he is handicapped 0_T
retarded any more than because he is
black or she is female. To take the
life ofa child for these reasons is not
only discrimination ~ it is murder...
Homicide is not a “personal matter
— it it an affair of the state: there‘
fore. who has a better right to inter-
fere in such a situation than th_€
government, embodied in the presi-
dent? After all, somebody sure has
to.

Forbes Field Memories

By GARY LASKY

As I walk across the campus of
the University of Pittsburgh and
approach the Forbes Quadran-
gle, a gush of nostalgia envelops
me; I now stand where the infa-
mous Forbes Field once stood. I
look up into the cumulus clouds
that rest in a beautiful azure
background, and for a brief
moment, I'm Bill Virdon antici-
pating a fly ball. I glance at the
newly planted trees that sur-
round both Hillman Library and
the Forbes Quad, and I dream of

those beautiful ivy-colored walls
that reach full foilage only in late
July. Just then, a host of chatter
echoes its way to me from where
the right field grandstands once
stood.

I wonder what all the commo-
tion is about. Then I see the great
Roberto Clemente trotting onto
the field, bobbing his head in his
own charismatic way. I hear the
crisp cracks of bats and the
thumps of baseball mitts. I pre-

‘ tend I see Mazeroski, Groat, Nel-

son and Hoak zipping the ball
around the infield with as much
enthusiasm as youngsters in little
league.

I’m so caught up in my
thoughts that I didn’t even real-
ize the Longines scoreboard
posted a three spot in the home
half of the Orioles’ second. Its
l2:30. One hour before game-
time. I have plenty of time to

Q walk among the grandstands

before the start of the game.

I wonder if that crazy guy
Windy is here. Who's Windy,
you ask? You know who Windy
is. There’s one in every ballpark.
O.I(. He's the one who hollers
out statistics from the third-base
side. Everyone laughs at him, but
God help the person who contra-
dicts his statistics. Once a show-
off in a nice suit tested the
validity of Windy's statistics.
That turned out to be a terrible
mistake — Windy had the whole

Rights
Ignored

Disabled

Dear Editor:

Interested as I am in public health,
welfare and the government, I
looked to your editorial on the Baby
Doe cases for an educated viewpoint
on the subject and instead found the
argument quite misdirected.

The issue is not, as you suggest,
the protection of individual rights of
citizens, especially sincevrights of the
newborns are not considered.

No, the issue is this: the children
involved in each of the cases were

. born with physical or mental han-

dicaps. They also had surgically cor-
rectable medical problems. The
parents of the children chose to
forego livesaving surgery and thus
ended the children’s lives. Can any
of us, in our wildest imagination,
honestly say that perfectly normal
newborns would ever be treated in
the same manner?

The victory you cite for protection
of individual rights is, in actuality, a
victory for discrimination. for now
handicapped newborns are treated
differently than non-handicapped
newborns.

third-base side laughing at the
humiliated showoff. After that
episode, no one dared question
Windy’s statistics.

Mmm, smell those bleacher
hot dogs. lfl had the money, I'd
eat every one on the grill.
Skinner looks so tall compared
to Cimoli. I wonder what they're
talking about. Probably about
the up-and-coming Red Birds
and the torrid Dodgers. There's
Bob Prince up in the broadcast-
ing booth. Heck, I can see his
flashy sportcoat all the way from
here. I think that’s Jim Woods
standing next to him. Who else?

Boy, what a beautiful day for a
baseball game. Dad should be
here today. Law against Ortega.
I wonder if the old Washington
Senator is ready for Law. I think
Friend is due tomorrow, I don't
know. Geez, the ground crew’s
out already?

Oh yea, its 12:45 already. I
think I have enough change for
Coke. On second thought, I bet-
ter save it for the latter innings.
Looks like its going to be .a
scorcher like yesterday.

When are they ever going to
paint that right field screen?

'“Excuse me, please," says a

pretty voice. “Could you please
tell me where the Hillman
Library is?"

“Um, this is Hillman right
here,“ I finally answered. “Oh,
thanks,” she says, as she makes
her way toward the Hillman.

Well, these buildings sure are
magnificent, but I sure wish
Forbes Field was still standing.
What a beautiful ballpark.

Foge
Sends His
Thanks

Dear Editor:

Again it's my pleasure to write
and thank the Pitt students and
fans for the great support they
gave us at the Penn State game.
This boost really started with the
pep rally at Pitt Stadium Friday
afternoon when the band, cheer-
leaders and large group of enthu-
siastic Panther boosters let us
know they loved Pitt. Having
been in college football as a
coach and player for many years,
I know how valuable enthusias-
tic vocal support is to a team’s
preparation and performance.
The Penn State game concluded
another successful season for the
Pitt Panthers, and naturally, we
look forward to more winning
seasons in the future. PITT IS
IT!

Thoughts At Large

Pitt-PSU Do Not Mix In House

By J. P. MARRA

A house divided should watch the
Pitt-PSU game in separate rooms.
This lesson I learned Saturday
afternoon.

My dad, the Chief, sent his first-
born child to State four years ago
only after I promised to remain true
to the Blue and Gold. Within I5
months, I had turned traitor. After
the I981 game, in which -— well, I
don't have to remind you what hap-
pened that year — the Chief sent me
back to State only four days into my
two-week long Thanksgiving vaca-
tion. He packed me some turkey left-
overs, bought me a one-way
Pittsburgh-to-State College fare and
told me, “Nice to see you again, son;
come back if you ever find your
brains."

When I told the Chief] planned
on enrolling here this fall, he was
overjoyed. He served notice to the
boarders abusing my bedroom,
bought a big ham and had Mom
cook it and serve it for dinner in the
dining room on our best blue and
gold tablecloth. The prodigal son
was back home in the fold, lending
support to the home team. “Can't
wait for the big game this
November, son," he beamed. “Sure
will be nice to be rooting for Pitt
with you again, kid.”

“Uh, Chief,” I said, “I don't think
I'll be rooting for Pitt just yet, big
guy_..

In half an hour, my plate had been
taken away from me, my rear end
was whisked quickly towards the
direction of the front door and the
Chief was on the phone looking for
another boarder.

We reconciled, ﬁnally. Given the
cost of Oakland apartments, this
was good. I got my old room back,
eating privileges and even use of the
car. Mom intervened, saying that if
the boy had been taken in by, say,
the Krishnas, it would take him a
while to learn to eat steak and not
demand curried apples and raisins
for lunch. There was little difference
in attending Penn State and,
remember, the boy had lived in a
fraternity for three years, so there's
no telling what could have entered

lnfanticide A Diluted

Dear Editor:

After reading “Ethical Questions" 

(The Pitt News, Nov. 21), I came to
realize that the entire issue of infan-
ticide has become a diluted issue in
today's society. I also realized that
many people take the rights granted
in the Declaration of Independence
and misinterpret or abuse them.
The Declaration of Independence
states, “We hold these truths to be
self evident that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed...with
certain unalienable rights, that
among these are Life, Liberty, and
the pusuit of happiness. That to

his mind. Give the boy a chance, she
pleaded. He'll come around.
Anyway, game time Saturday
rolled around. Mom, being
nobody‘s fool, made pans to be else-
where come one o'clock. The Chief
came home 15 minutes before kick-
off. He looked at me, seated on the
couch. “That's my seat," he snarled.
I moved. “Are you eating again?” he
demanded. I put the bag of potatoe
chips back into the cupboard. “Get

that damn shirt off!" he screamed. I
yanked my blue and white PSU jer-
sey off my back and shaved it under-
neath the couch. He grabbed it and
started playing “shake the rag” with
the dog. Understand that the Chief
hates our dog.

The game started. TCS flashed a
shot of the PSU cheerleading squad.
“Ugliest girls I've ever seen," he
growled. I knew it was going to be a
long afternoon. Pitt scored first, and
the Chief did a sort of Italianjig, if
there is such a thing. “Hail to Pittl,”
he shouted. “Maul those Lions!”

PSU came back on the next series,
I think, and Doug Strang hooked up
with Kenny Jackson on a long TD
pass. “Great play!”I exclaimed. The
Chief glared at me. “Great play, my
ass. Short had his arms wrapped
around Bill Maas. If Paterno didn’t
have the whole officiating crew

secure these rights, Governments are
instituted among men,..."

When a person's civil rights are
being violated, the government has
not only the authority to step in, but
it has the responsibility to do so. It
appears that the author of “Ethical
Questions” is not aware of this fact.

It also appears that the author has
forgotten a few other facts. These
children, handicapped or not, are in
fact American citizens. That is,
unless there have been levels of “con-
tribution" to society that must be
kept, added, to become a citizen,
and I know this is not the case.
Therefore, being citizens, these

wrapped up in his back pocket, he'd
be one and nine right now." I gulped
and laid back down on the floor.

As the game progressed, tension
mounted. My little sister entered the
room and announced that she was
rooting for Penn State, too. The
Chief wanted to know why. “I like
the squirrels there," she said. The
Chief looked at her in the eye and
said, “So you plan on driving a car in
six months, eh‘? It'd be a shame if
you couldn't use one of ours. Cars
are expensive these days."

Penn State quickly lost a rooter.

When Bill Wallace hauled in the
pass that put Pitt ahead late in the
game, the Chief brought out the
Canadian Club. “The party's over,
junior. State hasn't done squat in the
second half on offense. Strang will
chuck an intercept, and this contest
will be’history." He cupped his ear
and tilted his head toward the win-
dow. “In the distance, my boy," he
said, “I can hear the fat lady warm-
ing up."

And, of course, the rest is history.
State marched down the field with a
minute left to play, Dozier ran out of
bounds with no time left on the
clock, the zebras added a few
seconds; you could see the aneurism
forming on the side of the Chief's
head. “Damn it!," he bellowed.
“First they have the ﬂexible sideline
stripe, then they have the flexible
end zone line, and now they have the
flexible clock! That's OK, though.
There ain't no way they can get that
ball in the zone on this play. No
way.”

And he was right. The thing was,
Joe Paterno knew that, too. Ganci-
tano trotted on to the field, Strang
held, and the kicker booted a game-
tying field goal that left most of the
mouths of the residents of Western
Pennsylvania with a sour taste in
their mouths. The Chief said

nothing but turned on the Syracuse-'

West Virginia game and stared at it,
letting his glass of whiskey and soda
get warm.

He's still not talking to me. When
he finally opens up, I might be on the
phone looking for a place to stay
next term.

Issue

children are guaranteed all the rights
granted to all other citizens.

These children are being starved
to death in the sterile conditions ofa
hospital, and it is being permitted. If
a child is purposefully starved to
death outside the hospital, it is called
criminal neglect. _

All the court did was give the par-
ents the right to choose to kill their
child, to violate the innocent child's
paramount — the right to life.

registered from Duquesne and
Carnegie-Mellon. Davis hopes his
students will leave his class with a
greater appreciation of jazz, but he
admits there were “a lot of C5 and
D's on the midterms.”

Mediocre grades in a blowoff
course are not that unusual, accord
ing to Fred Koloc, director of CAS
Advising._.

“A lot of people in those classes
expect it to be easy, so they don't go
to class, don't take any notes. don‘t
study and then end up with ("s and
D's," he said. As an adviser, Koloc is
always dealing with students who
ask him which courses are the
easiest.

“lfl had to list the blowoffcourses
at Pitt, in all honesty, I couldn’t do
it," he said. “But l do know that in
some departments, particularly the
geology and physics 805 courses,
teachers are more reluctant to flunk
students.“

Taking The Challenge Out Of Learning

Koloc advises those students to‘
take a class in which they could learn
and then apply themselves. He also
said that most students who want a
blowoff class normally want it to
balance a schedule. “More responsi~

ble students are not looking for an‘

easy way out, they want to schedule
a class that won‘t break their backs,”
he said.

But what makes a blowoffa blow-
off‘? According to Robert Wolke,
faculty development director, it
often is the professor — not the topic
—- that makes or breaks the course.
Wolke believes that a good profes-
sor can make almost any class chal-

lenging and worthwhile and he feels I

strongly about teachers who fail to
make their class difficult enough.
“Personally I feel that inflated
grades are a tragedy," he said. “It
destroys the whole purpose of col-
lege. Grades are a stiff pain for ev-
erybody, but they’re anecessarv evil.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 23, I983

He’s An Intense Player,
Cool Under Pressure

“Pressure is an unrealistic expecta-
tion. Pressure is having to pay $70
rent when you only have $40. "

-— John Thompson
Georgetown basketball head coach

Curtis Aiken knew that in a few
hours he would have to go up
against Dwayne “Pearl“ Washing-
ton, the 6-2 guard from New York
City whom many considered the
best high school player in the coun-
try. Their showdown would climax
the annual Empire State Games.

A reporter, interviewing Aiken
outside the Manley Field House on
the campus of Syracuse University,
noticed a demonstration breaking
out when a group of students began
shouting slogans. People started to
gather around: reporters, TV crews,
students. But Aiken insisted that the
interview continue, despite the dis-
tractions. I

Pressure?

“He just took it in stride, like he

‘does everything,” said Larry Veron-
ica, Aiken‘s coach at Bennett High
School in Buffalo, N.Y.

Later that day, Aiken led Bennett

- to a one-point victory over ‘Pearl’

and Brooklyn’s Boys High School
by scoring 43 points.

- Aiken agrees with John Thomp-
son; pressure is an unrealistic
expectation.

“I am real strong-minded in terms
of what other people think and the
kind of pressure they can put on
me,” Aiken said. “The only pressure
that can be put on Curtis Aiken is
the pressure that [Pitt basketball
head coach] Roy Chipman puts on
him. If I live-up to his expectations
then I willbe all right." A

Chipman’s expectations could not
have been very high at one point in
the recruiting battle for the 5-H
freshman guard, who brought the
New York State Public School
Championship home to Buffalo.

Aiken, after listening to the
whispers and promises of hundreds
of college coaches, had verbally
committed to the University of
Kansas.

That left everyone,
Veronica, surprised.

including

“He’s not Midwest,” Veronica
said, “he‘s very urban. I thought
from the beginning that Syracuse
would be the school."

In the final days of the state
playoffs, the recruiters and media
turned Bennett's practice sessions
into something resembling a circus,
with Aiken in the center ring of
attention. g

Bennett had never won a state
championship, and rarely had a
team from western New York pre-
sented a serious challenge to the
boys from the big city. In the cham-
pionship tournament, Aiken found
himself matched against Greg Mon-
roe, a highly-touted guard from
Pittsford High School — who will
be playing for Syracuse this year.

Pressure?

On the first play of the game,
Aiken gave Monroe a little
shoulder-and-head fake, stopped
and hit from 20 feet — all net.

“Greg didn’t want to come up and
play him tough because he knew
Curtis could go around _him,”
Veronica said. “I was surprised that
they stayed man-to-man the whole
game —— it was just a mismatch.”

Aiken finished the night with 47
points, hitting on 2| of 30 shots, set-
ting an all-time New York State
playoff record.

The coaches and press, although
impressed, still wanted to know
where Aiken would spend his college
days

“That is what amazed me the
most,” Veronica said, “the way he
could handle everything and be so
unassuming.”

To Chipman’s delight, Kansas
later fired their coaching staff, and
Syracuse signed the ‘Pearl.’ The
Orangemen's head coach, Jim
Boeheim, still wanted Aiken, but
Veronica and Aiken both agreed
that the Carrier Dome, although big
enough to hold 30,000 spectators,
lacked the court space for New
York’s co-players of the year to
coexist. Pitt, as they say, was it.

‘Despite his scoring abilities
(Aiken scored 65 points in one game
his senior year), most people, includ-
ing himself, agree that the moldof

him as a scorer doesn’t fit. It’s just
something he does on the side.

“As good of a shooter as he is, he
is actually a better passer,”Veronica
said. “Some of the passes I have seen
him throw I wished I could have seen
again on replay because I don't
know how the hell he got the ball
there."

But Aiken admits that scoring
points is what makes people take
notice, and in his case, they have.
His honors include being named All-
America by Parade Magazine, USA
Today and McDonald‘s and being
selected as a member of the Big East
pre-season, all-freshman team, to
name a few.

Last spring, a couple of days after
he widened Chipman‘s smile by sign-
ing a letter of intent to play at Pitt,
Aiken made a grand Pittsburgh
entrance. He scored ll points in the
annual Dapper Dan Roundball
Classic for the United States team,
igniting the Civic Arena crowd with
two rousing dunks. Aiken’s new
hosts created another mold.

“I had the oppurtunity to dunk a
few and they label me a dunker,"
Aiken said. “But I think I am
nothing more or nothing less than an
all-around player.”

Aiken, nevertheless, will be
counted on primarily to eliminate
the most glaring weakness in the
Panther backcourt — the ability to
score consistently and frequently.
Basketball watchers agree that the
Panthers will need scoring from
their guards if they are to challenge
the Big East elite.

Pressure?

“I was put in a lot of situations in
high school where I was forced to
score points in order for us to win,”
Aiken said. “lfl get put in thatsitua-
tion here, I think I can dothe same.”

Aiken’s confidence aside, Chip-
man knows that asking a freshman
to replicate his high school statistics,
especially in the Big East conference,
is the stuff of bad sports movies.

“He has the toughest job in the
country, coming in as a point
guard,” Chipman said. “Fortu-

Dogs Fed Ferguson Confusion

Pressure is not getting into medi-
cal school. It isnot having three final
exams scheduled for the same day,
either.

Pressure is the next four years of
your life waiting in triplicate on a
dotted line in a college recruiter's
briefcase.

Marlon Ferguson knows all about

it.
* Ferguson scored 2| points and
grabbed l2.5 rebounds per game for
Center High School in Monaca, Pa.,
last season. Hefwas named All-
America by both McDonald's and
Basketball Weekly and honorable
mention All-America by Street &
Smith magazine and USA Today.

The 6-8, I90-lb. telephone pole
was the the most coveted schoolboy
in the area. His mailbox overﬂowed
with more than 200 scholarship
pitches. His telephone jingled from
6:l5 a.m. into the early hours of the
next morning.

“It got to the point where I
couldn't do my homework,” Fergu-

_ son recalled. “I would hang up with

one coach and another would call. It
got to be really bad.”

Headlines were accompanied by
migraines. Ferguson was confronted
by eager recruiters whose inkpens
were as swiftly produced as the
trusty six-shooter from a gunsling-
er’s holster.

“There was a lot of pressure
-because a lot of coaches wanted to
get me signed quickly and I wasn't
really ready to sign," he remarked. “I
wanted to look over the colleges first
and see which one I really‘ wanted to
go to and which one was better for
me.”

I

The days that immediately pre-
ceded national letter-of-intent day
are still a blur to Ferguson. He
reportedly gave verbal commit-
ments to three different schools:
Pitt, Duquesne and Ohio U.

“I don’t really understand it
myself," Ferguson said. “Lots of
schools got different impressions. It
turned out to be a bad scene, really
bad. Then the papers got hold of it.
Every little thing got taken way out
of proportion." I

The collegiate autograph hounds
heard only what they wanted to
hear, according to the soft-spoken
Ferguson. Favorable sentiments
were misinterpreted as verbal com-
mitments to later sign letters of
intent.

“One time, I was in study hall, and
the coach from Ohio U. called me
out," Ferguson continued. “I had
just taken a test and, well, wasn't in
the best of moods. He wanted to
know how I liked my visit there. I
told him I loved it; the campus was
beautiful. He said that was all he
needed to know.

“Next thing, he calls my mother
and says I'm going to Ohio U."

Ferguson’s recruitment was
further complicated by a favor from
former Pitt assistant coach Seth
Greenberg, who has since resigned
and taken a graduate assistants post
under Virginia's head coach Terry
Holland. Greenberg offered Fergu-
son a ride to a friend's house to
watch the NCAA basketball cham-
pionships last March.

NCAA and Pitt officials ques-
tioned Greenberg‘s motives and
once again thrust Ferguson into the
media‘s bullring.

Finally, four days following
letter-of-intent day, Ferguson
signed with Pitt. The past now
behind him, the future holds great
promise for the center-turned-
forward.

“He's doing well,“ Pitt head coach
Roy Chipman conﬁded. “The best
thing about Marlon, besides his
physical ability and shooting, is that
he’s a smart kid. He realizes that he
has to work on some things yet, like
his strength.“

Ferguson is plotted behind Andre
Williams and Chip Watkins on the
depth chart as a small forward, but
only temporarily. He trains regu-
larly at the field house to increase his
strength and develop into a domi-
nant power forward in the Big East.

The transition lrom high school to
college ball has worn Ferguson’s
morale thin.

“Right now my confidence is kind
of down, but I know why," he said.
“It's because of my strength. There
are a lot of things I could usually do
in high school I couldn't do now."

Although Ferguson may find
himself limited in his new role, his
undaunted marksmanship from
within l5 feet of the basket will
surely aid in his adjustment.

But the pressure still haunts Mar-
lon Ferguson.

“It's there if I want it.and I think I

want it bad enough. So I think I'll

get it.“

capability to do that this year.”

The’team’s lack of wins on the,

road never came into play with
Vaughan. Although the team was
able to escape with only one win (last
season over Connecticut 72-7|), the
Mt. Vernon, N.Y., native was
stellar.

In l2 of the Panthers‘final I5 ball
games, Vaughan scored 20 or more

points, including a 31-point effort at -

St. John’s on the final day of the
regular season.

“People say I‘m a shooter,"
Vaughan said. “I say I‘m a scorer. If
I had to defend Clyde Vaughan, I’d
be aware of where Clyde is at all
times. You have to play a physical
game, or he’ll hurt you."

Just ask Boston College. Vaughan
scored 50 points and grabbed 25
rebounds against the conference
champs in his team’s two contests
against the Eagles.

‘He faced a variety of defenses, cer-
tain that the same would happen
again this season, that were designed
strictly to stop him or, more realisti-
cally, to contain him.

“That just shows that people
around the league respect me,” he
said. “It makes me work harder to
keep that respect.”

The Big East coaches know Clyde
Vaughan; maybe they’rejust uneasy
about calling him a star.

“He's one of the best shooters I've
seen,“ St. John's coach Lou Carne-
secca said. “And he rebounds unbe-
lievably for his size — like someone
6-9 or 6-I0.“

“Vaughan is an exceptional
Pl3)’€I_'." Syracuse coach Jim
Boeheim said. “He’s strong and
physical with a great shot."

This year should be no different
I0’ Vaughan. but the team has

noticeable help: strength in
numbers. ’

“We're deep this year,” Vaughan
said. “Especially at the guard and
forward positions. I think you are
going to see some production out of
our center position, too.

“I think everyone has to give our
coaching staff a lot of credit also.
Coach [Roy] Chipman has us work-
ing real hard. It's exciting. I think I’ll
be able to look back at my four years
of basketball at Pitt with a lot of
pride.” ,

Off the court, he is a speech major
and needs l2 credits to graduate
after the fall term.

“I’m really looking forward to
graduating,” he said. “It's been
tough handling both, but I’m proud
of myself. I have a 2.5 average. and
I'm going to be finished in April.“

Vaughan has interest in becoming
a coach after his playing days, but
he's not sure when those playing
days will be over.

“Clyde Vaughan has to have a
good shot at the pros if hepeforms
well this year," he said.

MR. FRANCHISE: Currently. he
ranks fifth with l,382 career points
on the Pitt all-time list, behind Sam
Clancy (l,67I), Billy Knight ( I .7l3).
Don Hennon(l',84l)and Larry Har-
ris ( I ,9l4)....He has scored in double
figures in 42 consecutive games
stretching over two years
....Throughout the I983 Big East
season, Vaughan averaged 39 min-
utes per game....His combined scor-
ing and rebounding averages last
season were the finest performance
by a Pitt player since Pitt All-

son in I973-74.

.Ready 

Second Big East Season Puts Dr. Roy On Call

 

The 1982-83 basketball season
was not a memorable one for the
Doctor. Guiding a team by the hand
into the Big East for the first time,
Dr. Roy Chipman suffered his first
losing season as a coach. A 13-15
record, overshadowed by zinging
victories over St. John ’s. Syracuse
and Georgetown in the ﬁeld house,
was marred b y five straight losses at
the season's end.

Last season was a learning expe-
rience for the Pitt Panthers in the
merciless Big East. Now, in his
fourth year and prepared for new
rounds of conference warfare, Chip-
man couldn't be more ready. The
talent is abundant, but what it can
at*t'omplish this season will be deter-
mined by stamina.

In an interview with The Pitt
News. Chipman outlines the begin-
nings of Pitt's second Big East test.

TPN: Before last year, you noted
that Pitt‘s entrance into the Big East
would strengthen the program. De-
spite the squad's 6-l l record in con-
ference play, what kind of learning
experience was it?

CHIPMAN: The biggest thing
from a coaching standpoint is that it
taught us to get deeper. Now we
have to concentrate on playing con-
sistently. Last year, we had the emo-
tional highs and lows against teams.
We'd go out and beat St. John’s or
Georgetown, then come back and
lose to Seton Hall. We would get
high for one team, then lose to a
mediocre team. Last year, though,
should be no different than this since
it's tough to win on the road, espe-
cially in the Big East conference. The
problem is compounded by a young
team —— you try to attribute that to a
young team. We weren't emotion-
ally prepared. Now, it’s a different
story.

TPN: For the first time in your
college coaching career you under-
went a losing season. Did that really
annoy you?

CHIPMAN: It bothered me more
after the games we played toward
the end of the year. We knew it
would be difficult to reach .500 when
the season started. But we started to
slide around the final part of the

 

season. We were l3-l0 and lost the
next five games [Seton Hall, Boston
College, Providence, twice against
St. John's]. lt was discouraging
because I thought it wasa bad l3-l5.

TPN: Do heavy graduation losses
by Villanova, St. John's and Syra-
cuse bring images of definite parity
to a Pitt team that finished sixth out
of nine teams last year‘?

CHIPMAN: I think it's arrived.
but that cannot be said for George-
town and Boston College. George-
town has everyone coming back,
along with Reggie Williams and
Michael Graham [two of coach
John Thompson's three recruits].
Even though BC is without John
Garris [Cleveland draft pick],
Michael Adams and Jay Murphy,
they are very dominating. The point
does not mean you automatically
can go out and beat Syracuse or Vil-
lanova. But there are other teams
besides the top two, Georgetown
and Boston College, that are on
equal footing right now.

TPN: Nobody can then be con-
sidered an “easy" opponent any
more. .

CHIPMAN: The whole confer-
ence is better in certain ways. Seton
Hall picked up four junior college
transfers. UConn only lost one
player and Providence brought in a
couple of guys. Every ballclub is bet-
ter. Meantime, Syracuse, St. Johns
and Syracuse have to slide after los-
ing some key players. At the same
time, we’ll move up. We're stronger
now, more prepared, and we know
what to expect from the conference
opposition.

TPN: What kind of strength are
you looking at in anticipation of a
more maligned season?

CHIPMAN: Number one, we lost
only one player [Trent Johnson].
Ten of ll are coming back. Billy
Culbertson started every game for us
last season. George Allen is healthy
now and putting everything
together. [Joey] David had a good
freshman year and [freshman Cur-
tis] Aiken adds some outside shoot-
ing we were lacking. Clyde is a better
shooter and when you throw in
Robinson and Shepard [two
transfers], there are two players who
are maturity away from being great.

TPN: It almost seems a crime.
Here is Clyde Vaughan who led the
conference in scoring with 22 points
per game and was third in rebound-
ing with 9.2 per contest. Yet coaches
picked him for the preseason second
team. An insult?

CHIPMAN: People make a lot
out of those early things. The Big
East, though, is a very, very tough
league. Chris Mullin [St. John's
guard] is assured a first-round draft
selection. Jay Murphy is a first-
rounder. The same with Ed Pinck-
ney [Villanova forward] and Patrick
Ewing. Four kids named to the first
team are projected to first round

picks. You have to accept that. ljust
keep telling Clyde about [Leo] Rau-
tins — he just signed a $1 million
contract with the 76ers. lf they
would have selected Clyde. they
would have felt the same way.
TPN: Clyde seems pretty confi-
dent anyways. A couple weeks ago,
he said Pitt would finish anywhere
between first and fourth.
CHIPMAN: I almost choked
when he said that. MaybeClyde is a
little more optimistic than the rest of
us. Who knows‘? He probably knows
something the coaches and I don’t.
TPN: Taking into consideration
Clyde‘s accomplishments last sea-
son. what can a coach look for in the
wa ' of an encore‘?

 

CHIPMAN: There isn't as much
reliance on him this year as last. lt
wasjust natural to go with him after
Darrell Gissendanner. Dwayne
Wallace and Roosevelt Kirby. We'll
go to him still, but we won't depend
on him as much. I know he can
score, but he needs to better his de-
fensive ball play. His dribbling and
ball handling need some work. tool
don't think his stats will get any bet-
ter now that we have a more well-
balanced team, but l would like to
see him get two to four assists a
game. He made all the safe plays last
year. This year, he can make things
happen. He'll take more chances
with the hall.

TPN: How do you plan on hand-
ling your two latest recruits, Curtis
Aiken and Marlon Ferguson?

CHIPMAN: Curtis is a little more
learned than Marlon. Playing the
point guard requires a lot in that it is
the most difficult spot on the court.
It's like bringing in a freshman quar-
terback. Curtis has to learn the
offenses and move the guys around.
I know he can shoot; I'm not worried
about that. But he must be able to set
a tempo. Whether he can do that
now is still up in the air. Marlon is
still developing. He can shoot the
ball and block the shots. But when
we put him in practice situations, he
slows down and starts thinking.
How much help he'll need I don't
know.

TPN: Some talk has been surfac-
ing that Curtis might replace Billy
Culbertson at the point.

CHIPMAN: Right now, [Curtis]
is not going to start. Probably not
for a while. Before the season is over,
however. that may be a different
story. Billy is acceptingthe challenge
well, and between the two of them.
it's a competitive and friendly
situation.

TPN: One of the nagging ques-
tions last season pointed to Pitt lack-
ing some power and inﬂuence on the
inside. Have you yet found a viable
center?

CHIPMAN: We've resolved that
problem somewhat. Right now.
[sophomore] Keith Armstrong is a
legitimate center. He may still need
some help on concentrating. but he
does have the talent. He made the

biggest improvement from his fresh-
man to sophomore year l’ve ever
seen since l’ve been here except for
Clyde. His dedication during the
summer improved his style. His big-
gest problem. though. is having a
tendency to get into foul trouble. I
know he can rebound and block
shots. That's what we're going to
need for added power inside.

TPN: This year, you have two
eligible forwards: Jeff Robinson,
who transferred from Cincinnati.
and Darryl Shepherd, who trans-
ferred from nearby I)uquesne. How
much much will their development
be a factor this season.

CHIPMAN: Shepherd is coming
alon better than Robinson. Darryl

still needs to gain some confidence
but probably had the best game dur-
ing our scrimmage at Aliquippa.
Shepherd, when we stick him on the
court, tends to stop the flow. But he
can shoot, run, jump and has every-
thing you need to dominate players.
Robinson is not physically ready to
take a beating, though he does have
the tools.

TPN: Similarly speaking, will Pitt
be ready to turn some “upsets" like
last year?

CHIPMAN: We'll beat teams,
but the wins won't be [considered]
upsets.

TPN: Looking at your top pick
for the Big East, is Georgetown any
coach's dream team? The talent is
eye-opening.

CHIPMAN: They just have great
talent. It could be a coach’s night-
mare if they don't win. John,
though, knows how to handle his
players and instruct them. He.wants
them to play. And Ewing is such a
hard worker. I can't see anyone
going in and beating them at home.
And now they have too much expe-
rience. That‘s a plus. Patrick is now
in his third year as a superstar,
Michael Jackson is in his second
year starting and Freddie [Brown] is
back after an injury last year. He's
going to start. And they brought in
Williams and Graham. So there's a
lot of experience there. Even theit
back-up people have experience.

TPN: A couple notches below, is
it really a big deal that Syracuse lost
Erich Santifer and Leo Rautins, St.
John's lost David Russell and Kevin,
Williams and Villanova is now with-
out Stewart Granger and John
Pinone?

CHIPMAN: For every one they
lost, they pretty much replaced him.
It's going to make them weaker, but

by how much is hard to say. The
replacements are there. but they are
younger. You can replace them with
good players, but you don't have the
experience [that was] lost. No one is
going to tell me that when you take
Granger and Pinone out, they aren't
going to slide.

TPN: So, taking into account the
talent so evident in this Big East, at
what point do you believe Pitt will
reach the contending stage? When
will you seriously vie for the top
spot?

CHIPMAN: We'll be a contender
the day Patrick Ewing graduates to
the NBA. Parity will then engulf the
entire league. Everyone will be capa-
ble of beating everyone else. Right
now, that‘s a quest for the league.
l‘m not saying you want to see him
leave, because he does have excep-
tional abilities. For us, though, and
taking that into consideration. the
next two years will be big recruiting
years. We'll be losing Clyde but will
have the nucleus of a contending
team.

TPN: Sounds as if that could
happen the minute any coach got
hold of a Patrick Ewing.

CHIPMAN: Put Patrick at Pitt
with three or four guards, and we'd
be the favorite. Take him to any
team in the league, and they'd be the
odds-on—favorite.

Pitt and the Swedish National
Team presented each other with gifts
before the start of last night’s game
in a gesture of cultural exchange.
The gesture, however, didn't extend
into the game, as both teams played
distinctively separate brands of has-
ketball. The mix turned out to be
somewhat less than artistic.

The Panthers, behind a strong
second half, managed to win the
exhibition, 92-73, before a half-
empty field house, but not before the
Swedes put to rest the theory that
big men are not supposed to shoot
the basketball — at least not from 20
feet and out.

The Swedish team, composed of
the best that the nation's club teams
had to offer, kept it close in the first
half thanks to the deft shooting
touch of 6-8 center-forward Roland
Rahm, who hit on eight of II first-
half shots. Rahm finished the game
with 24 points. Pitt retaliated with
its best, Clyde Vaughan, as the All-
America prospect connected on 9 of
13 to give the Panthers a six point
hall"-time margin, 55-49.

The Swedes got no closer in the
second half. Pitt started to pull away
when George Allen connected on a
three-point play at the l0:45 mark,
making the margin 13, 70-57. Min-
utes later, Vaughan stole the ball
and went the length of ﬂoor to put
the Panthers ahead 76-59.

Vaughan pulled up after the hoop
and was taken out of the game, but
afterwards, he said it was only a leg
cramp.

By then, the outcome was in hand,
and fatigue had settled in on the
Swedes, who were playing their
eighth game in II days.

“We can play a good 30, maybe 35
minutes," said the Swedes head
coach Karel Herink. Herink said
that this was his team’s best effort
yet.

The Swedish sharpshooters began
to run out of net, and the Panthers
pressing zone defense turned the
game into what it was meant to be --
a gesture. »

“I have never seen big men shoot
like that,“ said Panther head coach,
Roy Chipman. “They were just
throwing bombs.

Lady Panthers Win 100-55

By scorr DELLETT

It was a typical basketball opener.
One team, obviously superior in tal-
ent, finally getting to play someone
other than themselves. And the
weaker squad must suffer.

This was the setting last night at
the Fitzgerald Field House, as the
Lady Panthers basketball team
coasted to a I00-55 victory over
Fairmont State. _

“When you win, you are satis-
lied,“ said Lady Panther head coach
Judy Saurer. “We did a nice job
tonight.”

Pitt opened the game with I4
unanswered points, as the Lady Fal-
cons went the first 5:39 without a
score. The Lady Panthers left the
court with a 49-10 lead at
intermission.

A harassing I-3-I half court zone
press bothered Fairmont State, as
the Lady Falcons turned the ball
over I9 times in the first half along
with shooting a pathetic l3.3 percent
from the floor.

“The press was one of the good
things which came out of the game,"
Saurer noted. “Another was the way
we pushed the ball up the court."

The second half was much differ- .

ent. Pitt, easing up after extending
the lead to as many as 50 points,
allowed Fairmont State 45 points in
the second half. Pitt only shot 38.3
percent from the floor - I8 for 47 as
the Lady Falcons improved their
floor percentage to 58.l.

“We had different personnel in the
second half," Saurer said. “In the
second half we played three for-
wards. while the first half we went
with three guards."

Saurer also experimented with
different defenses, which she would
have not done in a closer contest.

All-America candidate Jennifer
_Bruce opened her junior year off
with a 28-point, I0-rebound perfor-
mance. Stephanie Collins added I7
points and I3 rebounds in the first
half and the guard tandem of Lisa
Fubio and Kim Tirik scored I5 and
I2 points respectively.

Major Point To Be Made By Fiesta

The bowl bid was there, the
excitement over it nowhere to be
found. Saturday afternoon, after a
morale-crushing tie to Penn State,
Pitt football head coach Foge Fazio
gratefully accepted the Fiesta Bowl
invitation from vice-president Tom
Fridena, evenxhough the Panthers‘
mood was hardly indicative of post-
season anticipation.

The climate drew attention, but
without an opportunity to absorb
the woes ofa 24-24 tie aftertheir best
effort of the season, what could be
expected‘?

“I felt terrible about that game
and even sicker in the morning,“
Fazio said. “We deserved to win that
game. I felt bad for the kids, espe-
cially our seniors, who had worked
so hard and deserved it."

“Pitt clearly dominated the
game,“-Fridena said on Saturday.
“It's tough to take when the game's
decision is out of your hands. But
the Fiesta Bowl feels no less proud
and convinced.

“Pitt is the best team in the East,
they proved it again today. That was
our goal at the beginning ofthe sea-
son. We're pleased to have accomp-
lished that."

With the Penn State game‘s
impact possibly absorbed by now,
what type of an achievement does
the Fiesta Bowl and its $900,000
represent?

“Our criteria for choosing a team
is primarily ranking but included in
no specific order are record, the
schedule that a team has played, the
team's tradition and their location,"
Fridena said.

With the advent of the NCAA‘s
permitting the Fiesta Bowl to move
up to New Year's Day (in l98I),
which is when the major bowls
(Rose, Cotton, Orange, Sugar) are
played, the importance and credibil-
ity of its existence has skyrocketed.

“We began with a purse for the
participating teams of Sl50,000,"
Fridena said. “Every year, we have
increased. We believe; our bowl
ranks with almost any today. Two
years ago, when we hac Penn State
out to play USC (Southern Cal),
Penn State finished third-ranked in
the country."

The LiontTrojan matchup alone
created much of the bowl‘s all-
important credibility. USC boasted
Heisman Trophy recipient Marcus
Allen. and Penn State had high-
ranking and All-America tailback
Curt Warner.

Saurer was pleased with the indi-
vidual performances. “Lisa Fubio is
an enthusiastic and aggressive
player,“ she said. “Kim Tirik was
setting the offense well and Ste-
phanie Collins showed she is a fine
outside shooter."

But Saurer was more eager to talk
about Saturday night‘s matchup at
the Field House with lndiana Uni-
versity of Bloomington. The Hoosi-
ers, winners ofthe Big I0 conference
championship last year, have a start-
ing lineup consisting of four seniors
and a sophomore.

“They are a Bobbv Knight-type
team," she said. “They play exclu-
sively a man-to-man defense. They
are a real strong team. They should
give us a good test early."

lndiana matches up well in terms
of size, as neither the Hoosiers nor
the Lady Panthers have a starter
over six feet tall. But Pitt’s problem
should be solved soon with the addi-
tion of 6-5 Jennifer Tyner, a transfer
from Northeast Louisiana.

“Tyner will give us a legitimate
center,“ Sauer said.

For the moment, ' the Lady
Panther coach must be concerned
with the emotional level of the
squad. In the past, the team has lost
games that should have been wins —
a recent example is last year's Big
East tournament, where Pitt was
knocked off in the first round by
Georgetown.

“We have to prepare for every
game," Saurer said. “We won't look
over any opponent. There is always
a chance of any team beating us. We
don't need those upsets."

In fact, Saurer will have a unique
way of preparing the Lady Panthers
for Indiana.

“I have the players think we’re 0-
l.“ .

Bowl

Last season, Arizona State was
pitted against Oklahoma. The game
drew rave reviews, and the Sun Dev-
ils completed the season as the sixth-
ranked team in the country.

Enter the Jan. 2, I984, edition
(New Year's day falls on a Sunday,
so National Football League
playoffs take precedence).

Pitt (8-2-I) is ranked at I4 in the
UPI poll (coaches) and IS in the AP
(writers) while Big I0 member Ohio
State (9-3) is l3th in the UPI and
I4th in the AP.

The winner has the capability of
ending its season with a Top I0
ranking. -

In addition, the national prestige
carried by both squads adds even
more fuel to the fire.

“We're extremely pleased with
this season's match," Executive
Director Bruce Skinner said. “The
schools are only about I60 miles
apart. But the perception is that one
is a Midwest school and the other is
considered an Eastern team.”

The fact that Arizona residents
are not by and large originally from
Arizona leads one to believe that a
sellout is quite possible.

“The rap is out that I can’t shoot

“I'm going to show people I can."

Culbertson had played against
this and other European teams dur-
ing this past summer as a member of
a visiting squad made up of Big East
players.

“I knew they would be good after
seeing them this summer,” Culbert-

Both Culbertson and Chipman
agreed that too many points were
scored.

“We can score with anybody,“
Culbertson said, “but our goal is to
keep [teams] in the 60s or low 70s. I
think that is a legitimate goal for our
defense."

“I wanted us to move the ball up

want them coming back down as
fast, though.”

The Swedish team ﬁnishes up its
visit through the Big East conference

Cving Adventure at

By CHARLIE O'HARA

In reviewing the Pitt-Penn
State tie, some interesting ques-
tions and assumptions have
entered into my train ofthought.

Number one, why would
Paterno go for the field goal?

Many have come out with the-
ories. Paterno claims that he did
it for his seniors. Highly ques-
tionable when the same seniors
couldn't understand why. He
also said that if Dozier had taken
the run down to the l0-yard line,
that he had a play, possibly a
fake ﬁeld goal.

I am of the opinion that Joe
went for the automatic three for
one reason. He did not want a
loss to arch rival (and in this case
recruiting rival) Pitt on his
record when he tries to convince
possible recruits into choosing
the Nittany program.

lt‘s a bad move, ,.I_oe_ Why
would a high school kid want to
come to a program in which the
coach believes a tie is sufficient?
SMU received their due punish-

ment (a No.2 ranking with their
I l-0-l) a year ago. for the same
practice employed against
Arkansas.

While we‘re on the subject.
here's a Penn State story that
might have you questioning the
“Paterno Way" again.

After watching the “Paterno
Way," a weekly feature on the
“The Penn State Football
Show,” from the November l3
edition, I had to question .loe‘s
handling of his defensive back-
field this season.

Paterno said, in so many
words, that he demands a great
deal from his players. They must
be superior students and must be
willing to give llO% dedication
for four years.

Well Joe, you have absolutely
no excuse for ignoring the four
years of dedication that senior
backup safety Mike Suter has
put forth.

Theﬂname might ring a bell.
Last year he backed into a Penn
State punt against Alabama and
the Lidns fizzled 42-2|.

‘Paterno Way’: Right Or Wrong?

Pretty tough to forget, but his
play on that very same day was
far more impressive than that of
Mark Robinson. the All-
America safety who was injured
in the first half.

Suter, a highly recruited senior
from Jerry Faust‘s Moeller
empire in Cincinnati, where he
captained the state champion-
ship I979 squad, had six tackles
in a little over a half of play.
Most impressive was his inter-
ception in the end zone, stopping
a ’Bama drive.

A week later in the I982 sche-
dule, Penn State was home to
play Syracuse. Robinson still
out, Suter started and played the
entire game. He played well
again, with six tackles and a fum-
ble recovery.

But when Robinson came
back itwas all over for Suter.

Enter the 1983 season. Penn
State has been atrocious all sea-
son against the pass. Suter is a
senior, a good student (above a
3.0 quality point average) major-

Just a word or two....

It cannot be recalled here the
philosopher who coined the
phrase, but hindsight is 20/20:
perfect vision is ﬂashed about
once the fact is history.

Now, it would be utterly use-
less to dwell on history, that
being, in this case, the Pitt-Penn
State mismatch several days ago,
Already, it's obvious who was
mismatched; that need not be
driven home. However, one fact
still needs to be clariﬁed even
though it will never be resolved.

The 24-24 tie that became of
that 83rd meeting of the two
schools will forever be known as
“Time to Beat The Clock.” When
one clock expired at the end of
the game, the scoreboard ver-
sion, Pitt had won 24-21. How-
ever, when the officials’ clock
expired the score read 24-24..

vous breakdown or cerebral
hemorrhaging. An official keep-
ing time on the sidelines, though,
failed to inform the operator and
merely thought it enough to have
both Foge Fazio and Joe
Paterno informed.

Sure. Why inform the players
or the fans? — still bewildered

‘ Another note bearing interest
is that that deadball foul called

Whoever can explain that will
promptly be nominated for the
Nobel Peace Prize. The explana-
tion has been shipped to a dark
hole, never again retrievable.

Also headed for that infinitely
cavernous hole is the reason why
the officials never permitted Pitt
a kickoff return once Penn

’State‘s Nick Gancitano saved

Paterno‘s face with a supposed
six seconds remaining. If six
ticks did indeed remain, which
again still remains mysteriously
speculative, Gancitano could

from Pitt Stadium. No, the exits
weren’t the problem. A stunned
attitude better describes it.

No one will come right out and
say so, but the officials pretty
much blew the game, hardly able
to grasp control of the situation‘.
Yet for what other purpose do we
have gentlemen dressed as Afri-
can zebras?

Most importantly, the stadi-
um’s largest crowd of the season
was never informed of the addi-
tional six seconds that were to be
added at the :19 point when a
zebra called a dead ball foul or
offsides on Penn State.

According to associate athletic
director Dean Billick, the score-

“Something like five of the past
eight years that we have had teams
from the state of Pennsylvania,”
Skinnergsaid.

Penn State has appeared in the
Fiesta three times and has won each
time. In I977, the Lions defeated
Arizona State 42-30. In l980, they
beat Ohio State 3l-l9, and in 1982,
en route to their No. 3 national rank-
ing, they beat USC 26-10.

In Pitt‘s two previous trips to
Phoenix, the Panthers lost to Ariz-
ona State 28-7 in 1973 and defeated
Arizona 16-10 in I979.

The effort to sell tickets and grab
the Eastern television audience is
almost a must, explaining the rea-
soning behind annually stalking Pitt
and Penn State.

_ This season's match-up will high-
light some outstanding individuals,
also important to ticket sales and

television ratings.

“We’re pleased to have the oppor-_

tunity to showcase a player like Bill
Fralic of Pitt," Fridena said. “He's
like a well-trained Clydesdale. Just
look at him and then watch him
play‘. Pitt’s quarterback (John Con-
gemi) and the wide out (Bill Wal-
lace) have played outstanding
football down the stretch. And we
all know about Pitt’s defense --
[tackle Bill] Maas, [free safety Tom]
Flynn, etc.”

In Ohio State, quarterback Mike
Tomczak, split end Cedric Ander-
son and lethal running back Horace
Broadnax will be plenty of competi-
tion for Pitt tailback Joe McCall.

The Fiesta Bowl did this one right.
It will be a game with national atten-
tion and will showcase an abundant
amount of outstanding talent.

And there's a good chance that
some of the people will be able to

the early season breakdowns
were occurring, Paterno went
with a porous crew of Harry
Hamilton, Chris Sydnor, Mark
Zordich and Mike Fruehan.

Suter has not been given a
chance. For four years he waited
and still no chance. One could
understand it if those placed
ahead of him were experiencing a
degree of success, but they aren't.

When Suter asked Paterno
why, Joe told him that he felt the
guys he had in were better. The
obvious answer.

The story is written for recrui-
tees of the future. One mistake

be over. Let Suter be that

CUSTOMER INFORMATION FROM GENERAL MOTORS

RECALLS: WHY THEY OCCUR.
HOW TO ANSWER ONE ON YOUR CAR.

When General Motors
orders a recall, we believe we
are providing an important
service to our customers and
showing again how GM stands
behind its products.

Every car we manufacture
has 14,000 or so parts which
must be interchangeable. Al-
though the reliability of parts in
GM cars rivals that of the parts
we supply for lunar rockets or
for commercial jets, problems
sometimes occur and probably
always will.

You can’t repeal the law
of probability. Somewhere a
machine tool may wear unex-
pectedly fast, or a material may
have an invisible contamina-
tion.

General Motors tests its
vehicles for millions of the
dirtiest, dustiest, roughest,
coldest, hottest miles imagin-
able. We even put our newly
developed vehicles and parts
into thousands of taxis and
other ﬂeets in dozens of loca-
tions all over North America.
The goal: to put on real-life
mileage fast. But even this is
not the same as billions of miles
driven by customers through
every possible road, climate
and maintenance condition.

Then the law of probability
comes into play, especially since
we produce millions more vehi-
cles for North America than any
other manufacturer. Although
all car and truck manufacturers
—both foreign and domestic-
have recalls, we’re a little
more noticeable because of our
numbers.

If you receive a recall no-
tice on your car, you may feel
like taking a gamble and ignor-
ing it. Please don’t. Answer it
promptly. Follow the instruc-
tions in the letter. Recalls are
initiated to protect your safety
or to keep your car in good run-
ning order. .

We publicize recalls so
car owners will be aware of
them. By federal regulation,
General Motors has to notify
owners by letter and report to
the government on the prog-
ress of a recall for 18 months.
We go beyond the federal
requirements. GM dealers
send follow-up letters to
owners if no response is
received the first time. In
addition, GM dealers can use
our CRIS (Computerized Recall
Identification System) to tell
you instantly of any recall work
necessary on a vehicle recalled
during the last 7 years. This
is important to know when buy-
ing a used car. Ask any GM
dealer for this information.

If you hear on television
or radio of a recall which
you think applies to your car,
please follow these steps for
your convenience.

—First, wait until you receive
a letter from us saying your
car has been recalled. It may
take some time before mail-
ing lists can be compiled and
parts can be distributed to
the dealers.

—Then call your dealer and
give him the recall campaign
number supplied in the letter.
He will arrange an appoint-
ment to have the repairs
made. This could save you
time and could help the deal-
er to schedule his busy ser-
vice department.

If you have read or heard
in the media about a recall
campaign, but don’t receive
a letter within a month, ask
your dealer to check the dealer
bulletin or CRIS to see if your
Vehicle is affected. Give the
dealer your vehicle identifica-
tion number, which you’ll find
on your car’s title, registration
or warranty folder. It can also
be found on the instrument
panel just inside the windshield
on the driver's side.

There are cases in whf :h
the auto manufacturers and the
government differ over the
seriousness of a problem. And
these instances sometimes re-
ceive a great deal of publicity.
But such situations are the ex-
ception.

Almost all of our recalls
are voluntarily started by
General Motors before the
government is involved.

If your car needs to be re-
called for any reason, please
don’t ignore the notice. Taking
care of those problems in your
car is good for you and good
for us.

This advertisement is part
of our continuing eﬁfort to give
customers useful information
about their cars and trucks
and the company that builds
them.

INSIGHTS

INTO

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

The Year in Review
——Dan Vuic

With this year coming to a
close, we see the departure of
the “old” board and the arri-
val of the “new” board, full of
fresh, new ideas. But before
we forget the “old” board let
us remember some of their
accomplishments.

The 1983 Student Govern-
ment Board was probably
one of the best and most pro-
ductive governing groups
that Pitt has had in a long

time.

Some of their accomplish-
ments are helping with the
formulation of the new alco-
hol policy, getting bus
benches for the campus bus
stop, and last, but not least,

.they were instrumental in

reinstatement efforts for the
Internship Office.

Unfavorable conditions
during the renovations of the
William Pitt Union did not
make solving these problems
any easier. This was not the
only problem the board had
to face.

According to Mindy Gold-
berg, the board, in the begin-
ning, had misconceptions of

just exactly what their roles

were in representing the stu-
dent body. They didn’t know
how to approach the adminis-
tration with problems and
suggestions. “Conflicts arose
due to disagreements of how
to approach the adrninistra-
tion over matters rather than
the matters themselves,” said
Goldberg.

Although some of the
baord members had a hard
time addressing the adminis
tration, Goldberg found it
easy to deal with them.

“The faculty and adminis-
tration, especially the Senate
Committees and the Office of

the Provost, have been
extremely helpful and sup-
portive and have given me
nothing but support,” said
Goldberg concerning the
Internship Office.

According to Kathy
Brown, the administration
has not interfered with the
decisions the board has
made. This allows the board
to maintain “a certain
autonomy.”

There is, however, a bad
side to the administration.
There are too many channels
in which one has to go
through to get something
done. Brown found the
bureaucracy the biggest
obstacle in getting things
accomplished. This is a very
large problem. Computer-
ized Roommates is an excel-
lent example of the
bureaucratic run-around.
The issue whas brought up
and looked into in the begin-
ning of this year. The idea will
not be implemented for
another two to four years.
While the administration was
handling this, Brown and Ken
Stram were looking into alter-
native plans until the other
one could take effect.

This year’s board had to
overcome obstacles that no
other board has had to deal
with. The 1983 Student
Government Board over-
came these problems,
representing the students
with a vigor unsurpassed by
previous boards. We applaud
their efforts.

Reflections
——Darci O’Hare

After 48 SRC meetings, 16
newsletters, four Open
Houses, three positions, two
Student Organizations boo-
klets and one long ﬁght

against student apathy, my
two years of active duty in the
Student Relations Commit-
tee will come to a halt this
December.

It is, with some anticipa-
tion, that I retire to the obs-
cure life of being “just a
student.” A student with
more time to devote to stu-
dies and one who must use
my active duty to concen-
trate in seeking future
employment. Yet a student
who will miss the haven to
drink hot chocolate on cold
snowy days in between
classes. I, who have been so
motivated and determined to
inform others of Student
Government, feel weary and
agitated when one asks, “So,
what does Student Govern-
ment do?”

 

I, the one who has cam-
paigned so heavily in the last
two years about students not
being involved and not realiz-

ing the benefits extracurricu-

lar activities hold, relish the
thought of being able to rush
home in time for the “Guiding
Light.”

Being involved does mean
many sacrifices and more
responsibilities, but for me it
hasbeen so enriching that
the scale tips in favor of being
active.

From the makeshift offices
set up in what was then the
Recreation Center, with old,
wooden desks and ancient
chairs, I have moved, with
Student Government, to the
modern furnishings on the
sixth floor.

I have seen many changes
in Student Government and,
as well, changes in myself.
The faces of the Student
Government Board, the Allo-
cations Committee and even
our Secretary have changed.
The number of standing com-
mittees has changed—there
are two less than when I
started. Issues and conﬂicts
have emerged and sub-
merged.

As for myself, there has
been one major change, that
being caused by my involve-
ment in Student Govern-
ment. As typical of many
commuters, I attended
classes, went home, did
homework and relied on a
social life outside of the uni-
versity. I feel it is fortunate
that I was determined enough
to seek involvement and wil-
ling to transform myself into a
student who spends most of
her day on campus and now
has a social connection with
the university. I say “fortu-
nate” because I now feel like a
“real" Pitt student, and when
I look back on these “best
years of my life,” I will know
that I belonged and left a
small mark on this huge
institution.

Be A Link To A Healthy
Child

--Pat Guardino

It’s that time of year
again——the Christmas sea-
son. Many people have
started their holiday gift
shopping already and thou-
sands of kids are sitting in
Santas’ laps in malls all over
the country.

But some children aren’t as
fortunate. These children
won’t be opening presents
under the Christmas tree this

year becaue they are patients
at Children’s Hospital.

That is why Student
Government is holding its
Second Annual Charity
Drive for Children’s Hospital.
Your 50 cent donation pro-
vides a great service for these
children.

According to Richard Rie-
bling, director of public rela-
tions at the hospital, the
money goes into a “free care
fund” which is a fund that was
“established to help parents
and children who can’t meet
all or part of their bill.”

So be generous. When you
walk through the Towers
Lobby or the Student Union
concourse area, buy a link for
50 cents, or buy two for $1.00
or 10 for $5.00. Or do what
one student did last year. He
didn’t have change for a $10
bill so he gave us the whole
thing!

Most students showed
their holiday spirit by writing
messages to the children
such as “Get Well Soon” and
“Hope You Feel Better.”
Some wrote spiritual mes-
sages, while others wrote
Merry Christmas in a variety
of languages. And artistic stu-
dents drew pictures of holly
and ivy and other Christmas
symbols.

The nicest thing of all was
that no one walked past with-
out donating something. Last
year we raised close to $300.
This year we’d like to try for
at least $500.

So if you haven’t donated
yet, there’s still time. We’ll be
in the Student Union today,
November 28, 30 and
December 5; and in the Tow-
ers on November 29 and
December 1.

After all, giving is what the
holiday season is all about.

Q7

[52

 

—Karen Frost

Academic Affaris Commit-
tee. Sounds impressive,
doesn’t it? But aside from
publishing the “Review of
Course Evaluations” boo-
klet, you probably haven’t
heard too much about what

this committee does. I man- -

aged to talk to Bill Davis,
chairperson of AAC, about
the committee’s plans for the
remainder of the term and
any future plans they have for
winter term.

The committee has just fin-
ished distributing the Course
Evaluation books to be used
for selecting winter term
courses. Davis would like to
apologize for the delay in the
distribution of these books
and promises that next term
they will be out on the first
day of the registration period.
These books can be found on
the ninth ﬂoor of the Cathed-
ral of Learning and also in the
Student Government Office,
638 William Pitt Union.

One of the projects that
the committee has worked
on is the academic referral

The Pitt Nexis, Wednes_da_yNovembcr 23, I983

Spotlight

service. Students are encour-
aged to ask questions dealing
with various academic poli-
cies at the university. The
number to call for this service
is X5920.

Future committee plans
include bringing two sympo-
siums to Pitt during the win-
ter, term and sponsoring a

- used-book exchange. The

book exchange will be held
right after classes resume on
January 6 and 7. The commit-
tee is hoping for a big turnout
and would like to plan future
book exchanges for the fol-
lowing terms.

If you have any suggestions
concerning the committee’s
future plans, or would like to
add your voice to this com-
mittee, feel free to contact
them at X5920.

This is Davis’ senior year
and first term as AAC chair-
person. He is also president
of the Pre-Law Society, and a
candidate for the Rhodes
Scholarship, which includes
two years of study at Oxford
University. If he is not
awarded this scholarship, he
plans to attend law school.
