248 Freshmen Win Honors
At End Of Customs Period

Audience Of 700 Sees
Men Win Plaques
At Ceremony

By Herbert Rackoff

Chuck Herald got a bug in his ear.

Chuck Holstein felt a buzzing in his
head.

Dr. Held OK’d the idea.

And the upshot was that freshman
men have a customs program.

That selfsame program wound up
its duties for the year Friday when
118 men, the “cream of tlie crop,” re-
ceived plaques in recognition of their
merit during the ﬁrst half of the ﬁrst
semester of their freshman year.

Said Herald: “VVe have reason to
be entirely satisﬁed with the work of
the customs committee. It has com-
pleted its agenda in every respect, and
has produced results that we never
expectec.”

Said Holstein: “I was only justice
number six on the ceremony script,
but I feel that I should get some pub-
licity anyway. Yes, the customs pro-
gram was a decided success. I have
for Herald only the best of compli-
ments.”

Having judged the Class of 1939
upon the basis of scholarship, activi-
ties, character, cooperation, and spirit.
the customs committee held its ritual
in the Banquet Room of Memorial
Hall Friday, and awarded to those de-
serving freshmen, bronze seals of the
University on a background of brown
mahogany.

Large Crowd watches

The tribunal proceedings were wit-
nessed by a full house, and Herald's
most conservative estimate stated that
at least 700 freshmen heard the vari-
ous justices recognize the top 118.

Those freshmen whose names were
read out, who were requested to “walk
down the center ais-les,” in the words
of Louis Bearer, sergeant-at-arms, and
who were charged in the fewest words
any judge ever charged anybody with,
were:

Caesar Aldisert, Charles Allen, Don-
ald Balsley, Harry Bash, Leonard

Tonight the Community Forum will
hear a noted man in public relief
stud)’, C. Hartley Grattan, talk on the
subject of, “Taking the lid off relief.”
The meeting will begin at 8:15 o’clock,

torium.

Mr. Grattan is prominent for his
contributions to periodicals such as
the New Republic and the Atlantic
Monthly. He has also made an inves-
tigation of unemployment and relief

Merit Panther Awards
Given To 130 Women
At Heinz House

By Ruth Rosenthal

Friday at 1 o’clock 130 freshman
women received their ﬁrst University
campus pins. These pins—small sil-
ver panthers—Were distributed at a
Merit Panther ceremony at Heinz
House under the direction of the Cus-
toms Committee of WS-GA. It was
the fourth such ceremony that has
taken place at the University and the

last official ceremony for freshman
women.

Customs regulations began on
Thursday, September 19, when all

freshman women received green arm-
bands and at which time they were
informed of the meaning and purpose
of Custom regulations. During the
week of September 30 examinations
were given on the history, songs, stu-
dent officers and faculty members of
the University. After freshman wom-
en passed the test, they received blue
and gold felt armbands which they
wore until November 1.

On Saturday, November 16, fresh-
man women were the guests of the
Customs Committee at a Brunch at
Heinz House, which was decorated
like a football ﬁeld. The freshman
women were divided into two teams
and cheers led by members of the
committee supplied the football spirit.

List Includes 130 "Women

Watch Out, Mr. Brotzmanr-—
Here Come Pitt’s Weathermen

By Sam Williams

Did you ever wonder why it rains
Tuesday afternoons just when you’re
ready to go home, or why it never
rains on the days that you wear a
raincoat or carry an umbrella, or why
the weather man does have such a
high batting average? VVell, if you
do you’ll be interested in the meteor-
ological society which is being formed
at the University to study weather
phenomena.

This club, which is more commonly
known as the weather club, is being
formed primarily for the practical ex-
perience obtained by the establish-
ment of a laboratory. The shop will
be equipped with various temperature
and pressure equipment which can be
obtained from the physics department.
There are only two such student labor-
atories in the country, one at the
University of California, the other at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The club will also have at least one
lecture hour each week. At these,
some prominent weather prophet will
explain the intricacies of the fully
equipped weather bureaus. The stu-
dents will then attempt to put such
apparatus, on a much smaller scale,
into operation in their own laboratory.
, This idea is being backed by E. A.
Holbrook, dean of the engineering
school, A. G. Worthing, head of the
physics department, and H. E. Pavian,

assistant professor of aeronautical en-
gineering.

Mr. Pavian said concerning the
project. “It will be of decided value
to students of transportation, espe-
cially those studying aeronautics. I
believe that an accurate knowled_2_'e
of the weather is as important to avi-
ation as is gasoline.”

This society, however, is not limited
to those who expect it to aid them
materially. Students who are just
curious are invited to join. There
are no restrictions as to qualiﬁcations
for membership, except the desire to
ﬁnd out whether that new fall outﬁt
will be ruined by: Rain and cooler to-
morrow, clearing up late in the after-
noon.

Plans for the laboratory itself show
that it will probably be situated on
the roof of Thaw Hall or at some
point where it will be possible to erect
an anemometer, those whirling cups
that record the velocity of the wind.
At this point, there will also be lo-
cated a. shelter in which the record-
ing thermometers and barometers will
be kept.

Such a bureau will require the
daily attention of several members
and the interpreting of records will
require the work of many more, ne-
cessitating permanent activity in or-
der to receive any ‘beneﬁt from their
records.

Again As Queen

Wednesday night at 9 o’clock, when
Dick Gaert11er’s broadcasting band of
eleven men start things going with
a tune or two, President Paul Keiser,

’36, if he can get his formal accoutre-
ments together and arranged on time
and his queen, Beverly Brown, ’37, if

she can do likewise, will again lead

ples into the first da.11ce of the col-
lege association formal a.t the Grotto. :

The affair, previously set at $2 a
couple, is priced. at one-half that
amount this year, in line with the As-
sociation’s policy of making major
dances more easily within the reach
of John Average Student. The Grotto
Ballroom on the North Side is one of
the few ballrooms in the city large
enough to accommodate comfortably
the crowd expected as a result of this
policy.

Traclitionally in celebration of the
following day's Thanksgiving holiday. .
the affair will also put up a few dec-1
orative motifs in line with the Tliankm ,
giving day football event when Pitt'
meets Tech on the gridiron.

‘Dine, Dance, ’
Invites Downie

The Freshman Dance committee’s
surprise will be something new——to
“the freshmen, at any ‘rate.

The purchaser of a two-dolla.r ad-
mission ticket to the dance at the
Hotel Schenley will receive a stub
which is good for a hearty break-
fast at the Commodore, Seventh
Street and Liberty Avenue_ Chair-
man John M. Downie, BA39, dis-
closed today.

And that “hearty” isn’t rhetorical
exaggeration. The restaurant will
prepare three half-sandwiches,
coffee or hot chocolate, and ice
cream and cake for each diner~outer.

This dinner-and-dance idea was
ﬁrst tried out by last year’s fresh-
man dance committee, and the af-
fair was a success. But one disad-
vantage will be overcome in that
there will be plenty of elbow-room
for everyone.

“V\7e are taking over the ﬁrst and
second ﬂoors of the restaurant,”
says Chairman Downie. “The man-
agement assures me that 600 people
can be served at one time so that
nobody will have to leave early.”

The date. by the way, is ‘Friday,
December 6.

Business Shows
Exceptional Rise

Introducing New Auto Models
Improves Trade, Report Says

Nearly all branches of business

shared in the extraordinary gains for
the week ended November 16, as busi-
ness activity in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict showed a new high level for the
year. ~

The report issued by the Bureau of
Business Research Friday pointed out
that the index was almost up to the
highest level, recorded in the summer
of 1934, and a little more than 34
points above the lowest level of the
depression, early 1933.

The greatest gain last week was
made in the volume of trade, the index
rising from 74.40 for the week ended
November 9, to 84.7 for the week end-
ed November 16. This exceptionally
large gain was due mainly to the
sharp increase in new automobile reg-
istration, although department store
gains also showed improvement. The
decided increase in automobile sales
is accounted for, of course, by the re-
cent introduction of new models. In
past years, new models usually were
placed on the market shortly after the
beginning of January.

The index of industrial production
and the volume of orginating ship-
ments also rose moderately.

Debate Squad To Hold
Team Tryouts Today

At the regular weekly meeting of

ment at Westminster College on De-
cember 7, and for the contest with
Dartmouth on December 12.

Freshmen who wish to try out for
the debate on December 16, with
Coraopolis High School, are urged to
see Dr. W. M. Parrish, professor of
public speaking and director of the
debaters, in Room 220, Alumni Hall.

The question for the tourney will
be: Resolved, that Congress should
have the power, by a two-thirds vote,
to over-rule Supreme Court decisions
making laws of Congress unconstitu-
tional.

Names To Appear
Every Half Hour
On Big Key Today

Faculty Men, Outsiders, Students
To Comprise List; Induction
Planned For Next Week

Today is ODK tap day.

This morning several faculty mem-
bers, other men outside the Univer-
sity, and juniors and seniors leading
campus activities, will be officially
tapped into Gamma circle of the hon-
orary fraternity.

On the lawn near State Hall, a
large reproduction of the ODK key is
annually placed. On it, at half-hourly
intervals during the morning, names
of men chosen are posted.

By noon, undergraduates tapped
will get in touch with E. A. Batch-
elder, assistant registrar and secre-

tary-treasurer of the fraternity.

A week from tonight, induction of
tappees will take place in the new
Faculty Club rooms in the Cathedral.
Immediately following the initiation,
the highlight of the fraternity y-ear—~
the alumni banquet—wi1l begin.

The banquet committee, consisting
of N. Robert Seidle, chairman, Fred
Kiger, C36, and Israel Goldberg, 036,
plan for 75 to 100 guests at the affair.
Members of the local circle since its
inauguration in 1916 are invited.

Both Dr. W. L. Sanders, national
president, and William Mosely Brown,
national secretary of the body, will
attend the banquet, Seidle announced
Friday.

Chief speaker will be Dr. Ben G.
Graham, superintendent of Pittsburgh
Public Schools, who was initiated sev-
eral years ago. Russell Connolly,
C36, president of the circle, will also
address the diners, outlining the pur-
poses and functions of the undergrad-
uate division.

Leadership in recognized campus
activities is the prime requisite for
membership. Third and fourth-year
men with a quality point average of
1.39 or over are eligible. Activities
represented in the present undergrad-
uate group ofi12 include track, foot-
ball, basketball, The Pitt News, the
Panther, debating, Pitt Players, Den-
tal Interfraternity Council, SFA, Cap
and Gown, and Quill Club.

Freshman Club Plans‘
Round Table Forums

At a business meeting of the Thurs-
day Freshman Club it was decided
that the group would institute a new
monthly feature, a round table dis-
cussion or forum. This decision was
reached by the group after the main
ideas and features of the plan had
been set forth by Lee Campbell, BA,
chairman of the program committee.

“Usually after the lunch and speak-
er there is no time for any discussion,”
he rema.rked. "We believe that this
new monthly feature would give us
:1 chance to analyze the contents of
the talks.”

Campbell also laid down topics that
had been suggested for forum dis-
cussion. Three were chosen by the
club. They will center around dis-
cussions of communism, religion in
college, and characteristics of the New
Deal.

To lead the discussion of commun-
ism, Campbell chose four members.
They are John Finkbeiner, C; James
Kehew, C; Sam Williams, E; and
James Shaler, C.

Umermeyer, Poet, Attacks
Pedantry, Forced Learning

By Milton G. Lehman, Jr.

“You cannot force college students
to enjoy poetry,” declared Louis Un-
termeyer, America’s foremost antholo-
gist and poet in his own right, over :-1_.
cup of coffee at the breakfast table of
a friend Thursday.

“Outwardly college students think
that they are too mature to appreci-
ate poetry . . . that it is eifeminate.”
He smiled. “But even your virile
football star, after spring trainin_.c:
when his fancy turns to love, will send
his sweetheart ﬂowers, candy, and
poetry.”

Mr. Untermeyer, who was in Pitts-
burgli to deliver a lecture on “The
Glory of the Commonplace,” told of
his own healthy hatred for poetry dur-
ing his high school days. His teacher
was an uninteresting pedant. She
emphasized verse forms and meters
and technique instead of inspiring her
bored students with the beauty of
poetry. “She even made the an-a-
pest,” he ventured. Keats and Shelley
were converted into prudes, and at
the age of -14 the poet-to-be resolved
that he would have nothing more to
do with them.

Because of his failure to compre-
hend geometry. Mr. Untermeyer
never graduated from high school,
but went into his father’s jewelry
business in New York. As an avoca-
tion he became a composer. Inspired

by Bach and the great masters, he
realized that his music was merely
the rewriting of what he had heard
and enjoyed. As he said, “I decided
that my compositions were not orig-
inal. Instead of composing music, I
was merely decomposing the great
masters. "Then I turned to poetry.”

His ﬁrst volume, “The Younger
Quire,” a burlesque, was published
anonymously in an edition of 100
copies in 191.1. In 1914, with the pub-
lication of his "Challc-nge” came the
great imagist movement. I-lealizing
that this form, born from ‘.V:.=.lt Whit.-
man’s “Leaves of Grass” in 1860, was
not adapted to his style of writing,
he continued to adhere to the stricter
forms.

Mr. Untermeyer claims that the era
of free verse has come to an end.
Modern poetry, following the cycle of
fashion, has turned back to conserva-
tive types. While poets such as Sand-
burg and Amy Lowell did ﬁnd in free
verse a vehicle for their emotions, the
latter, a leader of the movement, went
back to conventional forms in her
later lyrics.

As America’s leading authority on
modern poetry, Mr. Untermeyer is be-
sieged by hopeful verse writers re-
questing advice and criticism. “Many
come to me,” he said, “and ask me to
read their work and let them know if

The Editor’s Easy Chair

In order to give the readers a11d the editor’s

low several examples of editorials reprinted from
papers of other leading colleges and universities.

Our Money’s Worth
(From The Kentucky Kernel)
HERE ARE few persons in the world who do not
like to get as much for their money as they possibly
can, but strange as it seems, college students as :3. whole
are not included in this category.

We work hard during the summer months and force
the family to deny themselves many things in order that
we may return to school in the fall, and then we start
“cutting" classes and trying to go to school as little as
possible.

This does not seem logical, but it is true in the ma-
jority of the student bodies all over the country. In
order to cope with this problem. university oflicials have
passed regulations which prevent students who have

been absent at more than one-fourth of the class sessions
from taking the examination in that course.

However. it seems that such measures should not be
necessary in schools of secondary education where the
students are supposed to be intelligent, clear-thinking
individuals. It seems to be an insult to the students,
but they do not resent it in the least. Instead, they go
along their carefree paths hoping the instructor will be
ill the next day so they will not be compelled to attend
the class where they are supposed to gain the knowledge
for which they are paying.

Something Of Absurdity

EVTEN SUPPOSING that none but “Aryans” were to be
allowed on the Olympic team, it is highly question-
able whether that would be any concern of the partici-
pating nations. It is not denied that members of every
race will compete at Berlin and, that they will be accord-
ed equal courtesy by the German government.

But the truth of the matter is that those opposed to
American participation-do not limit themselves to this,
the only relevant issue. Obviously, if they did, there
would have been no such disproportionate fuss. Their
attitude is admirably summed up by the statement of
Jeremiah T. Mahoney, President of the U. S. Amateur
Athletic Union: “I believe that participation in the
games under the Swastika implies the tacit approval of
all that the Swastika sympolizes.”

This attitude is patently absurd. Carried to its logical
conclusion, it would imply that no intercourse of any
kind with Germany should be tolerated, that scientists,
artists, men of letters, as well as athletes, should have
nothing to do with Nazi-dom. It would naturally follow
that England should not haev sent a team to Los An-
that England should not have sent a team to Los An-
geles because it disapproved of the lynch law, or that
Spain could never be considered for the Olympics be-
cause the government allows bull ﬁghts.

Letters To

The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

The logic of your editorials on the
Olympic Games is indeed surprising.

You say, in “Whither Boycott?"
(latest Olympic edit.) “despite the
fact that information coming from
Germany proves conclusively that the
games themselves will have no taint

whatever of anti-semitism, the cry
-still goes up for a boycott.”_ You
make this statement, use the word

"‘conclusively,” with the same aban-
-don that you used in your October 28
editorial “the prime factor about. the
games is that they are being held;
where they are being held makes lit-
tle difference. Everyone will agree
that German authorities are likely to
bend over backward in dealing with
the Jewish and Catholic competitors
next summer. VVith that point as-
sured . ”

VVe certainly believe that the Olym-
pic games should be held, but, as
stated in our resolution, we appeal
“to remove the games from Nazi Ger-
many to another land more worthy of
the honor.” “Where they are being
held makes little difference,” you
casually remark; what do you think
the whole argument is about?

It is not likely either that “every-
one will agree that German authori-
ties are likely to bend over backward
in dealing with Tewisli and Catholic
competitors next summer.” The In-
tercollegiate Newspaper Association‘
resolution states that “there is grave
danger that American Catholics and
Jews visiting Nazi Germany for the
Olympic games would be subjected to
similar treatment, while thousands of
visitors from all over the world to the
Olympics would undergo a barrage of
antisocial Nazi propaganda . . .”

“Vvith that point assured . . .” you
continue. And by whom? Do you
take the assurance of a group, who
even you agree are subjecting hun-
dreds of thousands to misery and tor-
ture, to mean a.nythin:2"? Assurance
by a. Hitler and a Goebbels and a
Streicher whose breaches of “assur-
ances” have been as consistent as day
and night.

On one important point we agree,
“it seems unnecessary to drag the
finest contest in athletics through
mire.” But we arrive at the conclu-
sion by utterly different routes. Our
position is stated nicely by Heywood
Broun: “I am not in favor of pass-
ing up the Olympic Games. I am

merely in favor of passing up Berlin.”
Hundreds of those athletes who you
say have “trained for years with eyes
and hearts set on participating in the
Berlin games” have voiced their pro-
tests at having the Olympics held in
Berlin.

We want the Olympic Games moved
for the very reason that—to para-

phrase your editorial—they should be-

long to the athletes and the followers
of sport and not to the politicians. I
believe that you are a champion of
sport for sport’s sake. If that is true,
we should be on common ground in
opposition to American participation
in the Olympics if held at Berlin.

Mr, Chase, in a Columbia Spectator
editorial says: “Frederick T. Birchall
(Berlin correspondent for the New
York Times) reported some time ago
that the German Olympic team would
be a ‘political team’ entirely under
Nazi control and probably wholly
Nazi in complexion. Recent develop-

ments bear out his predictions. Nazi
politics is playing an increasingly
vital role in the Olympic plans. With

a.s far as we know, only two excep-
tions for the purpose of window-dress-
ing, Mr. Birchall’s estimate of the
Nazi complexion of the German team
still holds."

In “Whither Boycott” the issue at
hand is side—tracked for the Negro
problem in this country. VVe all
agree that there is a race problem in
this country; but it is inﬁnitesimal
as compared with the religion prob-
lems of Germany. A11d one is con-
stantly being reduced in proportion,
the other increased!

Your conclusion in the more 'recent
editorial is flushed with the same
vein of generality and unscientiﬁc ob-
servation that characterizes earlier
paragraphs. “But just the other day
an athlete sailed from New York to
participate in the ‘winter events of
the Olympics,” you ﬁnally observe.
So what?

Every day thousands are added to
the long list of protesters now in-
cludinsr Judge Jeremiali T. Mahoney
(president of the Amateur Athletic
Union). Dr. John Haynes Holmes.
Gen. Hugh S. Johnson, Heywood
Rrouu, Dr. I-la,i'i'y Emerson Fosdick.

While the following letters are not
strictly “To the Editor.” they have
found their way to the Editor’s desk
and are here printed because the na-
ture of their praise touches upon
many readers of The Pitt News.

November 15, 1935.
Dear Mr. Strong:
On behalf of the Corps of Cadets,
I wish to thank you as senior
Cadet in the Pitt ROTC for the hos-«

pitality extended the Corps on its
visit to Pittsburgh. Every Cadet
frankly and sincerely enjoyed him-
self to the utmost during every min-
ute of our short stay with, of course,
the natural exception of the last
quarter of the football game. Our
defeat, although a severe one, was
shortly forgotten; thanks to your
wholehearted welcome.

I personally enjoyed meeting you
and wish to congratulate you on the
excellent military unit which you
obviously have at the University.

Vvishing that it were possible to
return this hospitality, I an1,

VVILLIAM C. WESTMORELAND,

Cadet Regimental Commander,
U. S. Corps of Cadets.

“Hail to Pitt”

A famous phrase, no doubt, to stu-
dents at the University of Pitts-
burgh. And a loved one. It is pleas-
ant to assure the students at Pitt,
the Alumni, and the people of the
city of Pittsburgh. that the phrase
has become equally meaningful to
the Corps of Cadets.

Two Saturdays ago the ‘Corps of
Cadets marched into an unfamiliar
stadium, to be greeted by the friend-
ly acclaim of “strangers.” Ten hours
later, the Corps left the city of Pitts-
burgh, obligated to the most hospit-
able friends. Nothing but compli-
mentary phrases came from the
lips of the cadets on the trip home,
and fond memories recall a wonder-
ful time as the guests in your city,
and of your University.

The dance was wonderful, at the
William Penn. The ladies were
most charming, and the ROTC
played hosts in grand style.

The Corps, to the man, thanks you
one and all for your hospitality.

Pointer staff at the request of many
cadets.)

New Cathedral Library Facilities Ready
In February, Declare Rushed Authorities

By P. Bernard Fleming
It’s going to be February, no less.
The new library being built on the
fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth ﬂoors of the
Cathedral will soon be ready.

Few students went with willing
hearts and light steps to the State
Hall library where many of the books
they wanted were out, or if not out,
packed in unpainted wooden cases.
Pre-ﬁnal exam period ﬁnds the State
Hall library jammed with students
practically crying for admission.

The location of the library was an-
other uot-so-good feature. It is par-
tially central, to be sure. But an in-
creasing number of classes are con-
centrated in the Cathedral.

Rain, too, adds to the discomﬁture
of travelling to and from the State
Hall library. Rain is useful, some-
times, but with several books under
your arm, no rain coat, and a cold,
pelting, wind—blown rain beating
against your face, soaking your books,
notebooks, papers, the trip is no
pleasure. Too often one is forced to

Attacks Pedantry

(Continued from Page One)
they should continue writing. I al-
ways tell them that they should not.”
He went on to explain that poetry
must be impelled by something with-
in. A poet will be a poet because he
knows that he can and must write,
and not because someone has favor-
ably criticized his writing.

“I never expected to live by my

poetry,” Mr. Untermeyer declared. “I
worked in the day and wrote at night.
When I was fortunate in having my
anthologies accepted as texts by high
schools and colleges, I turned my a,Vr_)-
cation to a vocation.” His anthology
“Modern American and Britsh Poet-
ry” is in use at present in the Pitts-
burgh high schools.

Mr. Untermeyer claimed that inspi-
ration can be the source of only
shorter lyrics. Longer odes and epics
such as “Paradise Lest” are not in-
spired work. The idea may be an
inspiration, but it must be worked
and mulled over.

The idea for the poet’s “Caliban in
the Coal Mines,” believed by many to
be his most popular poem, was the re-
sult of a visit to the Scranton coal
mines. “It was my ﬁrst inspired
poem,” Mr. Untermeyer said. A sym-
bol of crushed humanity, Caliban con-
cludes with:

“Nothing but blackness above
And nothing that moves but the
cars . .
God. if you wish for our love,
Fling us a handful of stars-”

pleasure and often one is forced to
remain inside the grey stone interior
of the tall building.

It is a sad picture. Students
thwarted at every turn they make to
study. The grim spectre of many
ﬁagstones, and many more steps, of
rain, of sickness, too much. The stu-
dent sinks back in a stupor of defeat.
Only a Pi Tau Phi makes his way
through the vast space impending be-
fore the State Hall library.

The majority of students will not
see the new bibliostacks until their
completion sometime early next year,
very likely in February. No effort to
rush completion is being spared, but
weather conditions which slow up the
drying of the paint and similar una-
voidable difﬁculties may drag the con-
struction out a bit more than is ex-
pected.

The fourth ﬂoor of the Cathedral
will be the stack room. Most of the
stacks are in place and only ﬁnishing
touches are needed. A special book
conveyor has been installed. Book

request slips will be sent down a
vacuum chute and the stack boys will
find the books which will be conveyed
up the special lift and automatically
deposited on the main ﬂoor, the ﬁfth.
Other rooms on the fourth are painted
in yellow and are well lighted. These
will be used for special purposes.

The main reading rooms are well
lighted and have high vaulted ceil-
ings of special sound-prooﬁng material
to make studying there as pleasant
as is mechancially possible. The quar-
ters are quite ample for even exam
period use.

The sixth ﬂoor of the library ﬂoors
is now being plastered and work on
the student lounges will be pushed
forward.

The design of all the rooms is sim-
ple and pleasing. The soft yellows
and browns of the painting are an-
other feature. But with the concen-
tration of classes in the Cathedral, a
lot of students will be utilitarian
enough to think the best thing will
be its convenience.

Ayars Claims CPA Course

Not Given Due Recognition

 

The Certiﬁed Public Accountant
Preparatory Course, offered by the
University Accounting Department for
the last two years, hasn’t been given
due recognition, according to Robert
D. Ayars, professor and head of the
Accounting Department.

Headed by C. L. Van Sickle, associ-
ate professor of accounting, the
course is under the supervision of the
staff of the accounting department.
In order to make doubly sure that the
course is presented on a high plane,
an advisory committee keeps in con-
stant touch with its activities. The
committee consists of such outstand-
ing men in the ﬁeld of accounting as:
Frank VVilbur Main, senior partner of
Main and Company, and for many
years a member of the Pennsylvania
State Boards of CPA examiners; Paul

VV. Pinkerton, CPA, resident partner
of Haskin and Sells; and Otto G.
Richter, CPA, senior partner of
Richter and Company, and ex-pres'i-
dent of the Pennsylvania Association
of Certiﬁed Public Accountants.

The content of the course, the
unique plan to be followed i11 its de-
velopment, and its other important
aspect, have been obtained.

Experts from the ﬁelds of account-
ing and business have been selected

on the basis of their ﬁtness to discuss
particular subjects. Each speaker is
outstanding in his particular ﬁeld.
The course is so designed as to
make an appeal not only to those who
are planning to sit for the Certiﬁcate,
but for the practitioners and qualiﬁed
students of accounting who desire to
prepare themselves better to meet

the demands made by- the ever in-.

creasing complexities of moder11 busi-
ness, according to Ayars.

Aside from preparing an accountant
for the CPA exam, it educates him to
be ﬁt for the responsibility of becom-
ing more and more the counselor of
business.

Since this is a comprehensive re-
view, the same number of credits
cannot be allowed for this course as
are allowed for a basically new course
in accounting. Because some credit
should be allowed for the time, any
student who has completed the course
with a “B” average can receive a
maximum of six credits.

The meetings are held once a week
on the tenth ﬂoor of the Chamber of
Commerce Building.

The tuition for the entire course
amounts to $100.

Should any student who has attend-
ed regularly and submitted all the re-
quired material in satisfactory condi-
tion fail the State or American Insti-
tute examination, he may repeat the
course by paying only the extra costs,
$20.

Plot Ford Horatio Alger? Read Life
  0fRoman, Education School Senior

If Horatio Alger were alive today.
he might ﬁnd the story of Michael

Roman, a University education senior,
a ﬁt theme for a novel.

Roma.n, born of Russian parents,
was raised in East Conemaugh in
Cambria County, and despite the
handicap of a non-American environ-
ment, where no English was spoken,
mastered the language while in high
school, and last September missed the
Democratic nomination for the clerk
of courts of Cambria county by the
margin of 301 votes.

' For the ﬁrst three years of his col-
lege career, the 23-year-old politician
attended the Johnstown center of the
University. This year he transferred
to Pittsburgh to complete his training
in the School of Education.

Rainfall R a is e s
Health Standard,

Carlson Avers

The Student Health Service, from a
purely humanitarian standpoint, is
quite satisﬁed with a peculiar weather
phenomenon. The fact that since the
beginning of the semester it has
rained regularly every Tuesday, may,
to some, mean nothing more than the
fact itself.

To the Student Health Service in
Falk Clinic it has meant increased
standards of general health among
men at the University.

The regular rainfall each Tuesday,
according to Dr. H. C. Carlson, direc-
tor at the Clinic, has been responsible
for a decrease in the usual number of
colds among students, having washed
Pittsburgh’s air clean of dirt and soot
which, germ-laden, enter the nose and
throat passages and cause irritations
leading to colds.

It is generally admitted at the
Clinic that colds are the largest and
most dominant health bugaboo to
University students and Pittsburgh
residents as a whole. A lessening of
the cold menace this year due entire-
ly to weather phenomena should set
many interested observers watching
for the outcome of local rain condi-
tions tomorrow.

Among other observations made at
the Clinic is this one by Dr. Paul
Zehfuss of the staff: student colds
are more predominant on Mondays
and Tuesdays, perhaps attributable,
he suggests, to weekend dancing and
other activities which overheat stu-
dents i.n a warm environment. only to
have them encounter the cold, windy
conditions of the outdoors.

Kappa Sigs Dethrone Delts;
Capture Touch Football Title

Mahony Scores Lone Touchdown On Pass From Groat;
Losers Fail To Threaten In Hard Battle

Kappa Sigma hitched its football team to a shooting star Fri-

day, rising to the highest point on

the fraternity gridiron horizon by

eclipsing Delta Tau Delta, 6-0, and in so doing capturing the Inter-

fraternity Touch Football crown.

It was a spirited Kappa Sig outﬁt that outrushed, outcharged,
and outscored the former title-holders for a well-deserved triumph.

When Marty Groat tossed
touchdown pass to Paul Mahoney late
in the ﬁnal period, it marked the cli-
max of a titleward march that had
mowed down ﬁve straight opponents
and added another trophy to the
Kappa Sig collection.

Bill McMunn placed the pigskin in
scoring position when he returned an
intercepted pass to the enemy 25-yard
marker. On the next play he regis-
tered the Kappa Sigs’ i11itial ﬁrst
down on a pass to Kaires, followed
by a ru11 through left guard.

Previous to this, the Red and White
made a strong scoring bid which fell
short on the one-yard line. Bud
Beachler stepped in the way of an in-
tended pass to Duff in mid-ﬁeld and
dashed to the 12-yard line. Groat
then passed to McMunn, and followed
this with a pass to Summers. On
fourth down, Sam Ralston broke
through and nailed Groat on the one-
yard stripe.

The Delts were never in a threat-
ening position and their only ﬁrst
down was made when Nape {Hepburn
scampered around right end for 12
yards to put the ball on his own 30-
yard line. This ﬁrst down was only
the second that had been recorded
against the Kappa Sigs throughout
the entire tournament.

In addition to snatching the touch-
down pass, Paul Mahoney distin-
guished himself with a bang-up de-
fensive performance, while Bill Mc-
Munn and Marty Groat were the main
cogs in the Kappa Sig offense. For
the losers, Sam Ralston and Nape
Hepburn stood out.

ting the yearling squad through its
ﬁnal paces in preparation for the
Navy Plebe game a.t Annapolis, ‘1‘hurs-
day morning.

The starting lineup will probably
be the same one which took the ﬁeld
against Penn State and West Virginia.
Bill Daddio, who has been playing a
consistently good game at end for the
Little Panthers this season, will start
at one end. Teaming up with Daddio
at the other wing post will be Fabian
Hoffman.

A pair of hefty boys, Al Lezousky
and Elmer Merkovsky, will hold down
the tackle positions. Lezousky has
been performing at the right tackle
post very creditably since Ben Aso-
vitch, who started the season at this
position, was injured.

Navy Plebe backs will run into dif-
ficulty when they try the center of
the line and ﬁnd two sturdy linemen,
Steve Petro and Al Raskowski, at the
guards. Bob Dannies will start at the
pivot position.

In the backﬁeld Coach Milligan will
use four boys who have been doing
yeomen service all year. At the sig
nal-barking post, John Chickerneo,
who was shifted from the fullback po-
sition, will probably start. In wing-
back roles, two men who have run
into enemy territory often this year,
Marsh Goldberg and Hal Stebbens,
will perform. Clem Cambal, who has
played a steady brand of ball all this
season, will probably handle the full-
back assignment.

Varsity Gridders
Set For Carnegie

Shedlosky ‘To Start At Halfback;
Teams Stop Hard Workouts

With both lineups for the Thanks-
giving day game practically set, the
football elevens of Pitt and Tech are
expected to take things comparatively
easy from now until game time Thurs-
day.

Leo11 Shedlosky, veteran Panther
back, may be in the starting lineup at
Bob LaRue’s post in the coming game.
LaRue, injured in the Cornhusker
clash, will probably be withheld from
action until the Southern California
game 011 December 14.

Over iii the Tartan bowl, Coach
Harpster has been drilling his boys
very strenuously the past Week to get
them in the proper shape for the com-
ing battle. It is likely that Harpster
will give the seniors on the Tech
squad some preference in selecting his
lineup for Thursday.

At the present time, Babe Patt and
Paul Moore seem to have the 110d for
the end position. Moore is a senior,
while his teammate has another year
of competition left after this one.
Frank Sanford, a senior, may start in
Patt’s position.

A pair of juniors, “Jurk” Hall and
Nestor Henrion, will be the choices at
tackles. Henrion has been one of the
standouts on the Plaid line this sea-
son. At guards Frank Chyczewski, a
junior, and Jock Sutherland, sopho-
more star, will start; and co-captain
Steve Trbovich, veteran center, will
command a lot of respect from his
snapper-back position.

Charley Spisak, another senior, will
be used at quarterback, and either
Rosie Rosenthal, hero of the Purdue
game, or Fred Lehman will get the
call at the blocking halfback posi-
tion. Co-captain Steve ‘Terebus, di-
minutive backﬁeld star, winding up a
glorious varsity career. will probably
start at the other halfback post, and
Steve Napotnik, sophomore, will ﬁll
the fu1lback’s shoes.

Undoubtedly, one of the major fac-
tor’s in Pitt's great improvement has

-been due to the work of the forward

wall. In the Cornhusker game, there
were usually four or five Panther
linemen in the Nebraska backﬁeld on
practically every play.

Sites, playing his last year for the
Blue and Gold, has turned in ﬁne
performances in the last two struggles,
and Frank Souchak did a good job at
the other end against Nebraska. Art
Detzel and Averell Daniell at tackles
have left little to be desired for their
play, and Biff Glassford and Dante.
Dalle Tezze have been holding up
their standards i11 ﬁne shape at
guards.

Nick Klisky upholds the Pitt tradi-
tion of ﬁrst—rate centers with con-
sistent performances at the pivot po-
sition.

By virtue of victories over Army
a.nd Nebraska, Coach Sutherland’s
Panther stock was boosted several
notches.

Bill Glassford

A typical Sutherland guard, who rates among the best in the coun-

try. Glassford is one of the fastest
pound weight. Biff, as he is called

men on the squad despite his 195-
by teammates, has one more year

of competition ahead of him. The Tartan backs should keep him well

in mind when they go plunging into

that left guard post.

I Panther Facts—Did You Know . . .

That the Panthers have represented
the East three times in the annual
Rose Bowl classic, and thrice have re-
turned defeated, losing January 1,
1928 to Stanford, 7-6, losing January
1, 1930 to Southern California, 47-14,
and bowing again to the mighty Tro-
jans January 1, 1933, 35-0.

That the worst season Dr. Suther-
land has had here at Pitt was the ﬁrst
season he coached, 1924, when the
Panthers won 5, lost 3, and tied 1
which was not a bad record at all.

That the Panthers had one perfect
team, in 1910. Under Coach Thomp-
son, Pitt had an undefeated, untied,
and unscored on team?

That the most games Pitt ever lost
in a row was in 1912, when the Golden
Panthers were defeated four times?

That the most defeats the Panthers
have suffered at the hands of a single
opponent have been at the hands of
Penn State and Lafayette? Both teams
were able to subdue the Panthers on
ﬁve occasions.

Coach Carlson has had his varsity

Vvhile on the subject of Garcia, the
Writer wishes to correct a mistake in
the basketball story in last Monday's
Pitt News. In that story it was said
that Garcia was a junior and had seen
plenty of action on last year’s varsity
as a substitute. In correction, Garcia
is a junior, but a sophomore as fa.r
as sports are concerned, having played
all last season on the cage team.
Over the Thanksgiving vacation,
Carlson and the team will travel to
Akron, Ohio, for a practice tilt with
the Akron Goodyear ﬁve. The game
will be played Saturday evening.
