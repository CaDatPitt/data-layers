Associated Press Writer

A Pittsburgh trolley carrying
dozens of commuters
slammed into an office build-
ing after losing its brakes Wed-
nesday, injuring 37 people,
four seriously, authorities said.

”You could hear it screech-
ing and then, ‘Wham. Bam.

a receptionist who had just ar-
rived at work.

The streetcar’s brakes failed
as it was. going- downhill
through a tunnel at 8515 a.m.
The driver ordered the pas-
sengers to the back of the trol-
ley as it picked up speed.

Some of the passengers
blessed themselves as they
moved back and dropped to
the floor.

passenger bound for jury duty.
”_Everybody moved to the
back  very orderly. The only
screaming was pretty much af-
ter it stopped.”

The streetcar sideswiped a
city bus and a truck, ripped
out a’ utility pole and fire
hydrant, then slammed into
the Gatehouse, a six-story,
brick office building.

Paul Gilliland, 55, was
working on a computer in his
first-floor office of the Gate-

Bam.’ The whole building‘

trolley headed his way.
”The glass was in before I
got out," he said, surveying.
the shards of glass in his office
and bent window blinds. ’’I’m
_lucky.’’ A ,
Shaken but safe, Gilliland
ran outside to help passengers
out_of the wreckage. _
”They were in shock,” he
said. ”Once they were out and
saw they could still move, they
sat on the curb and tried to
recover.” ‘
About 20 passengers, many
of them wrapped in blue
blankets, quietly waited for
paramedics outside Station
Square, a complex of offices
and shops. Many of their faces
were smudged with dirt, and
one ~ woman wore a neck
brace. _

Black Greeks sponsor charities separate

~ By Marc Duchin

News Editor

Pitt Black fraternitesand sorori-
ties — members of the Interfrater-
nity Council and the Panhellenic
Association — have chosen not to
fully participate in this year's
Greek Week, as they have not for
the past several years, according
to Bridget Guernsey, greek
advisor.

Black fraternities and sororities
at Pitt include Kappa Alpha Psi,
Phi Beta Sigma, Alpha ‘Kappa Al-
pha, and Delta Sigma Theta.

”We don't have just one char-
ity,” said Josie Hand, vice-
president of Alpha Kappa Alpha
sorority. ”We try to focus on
almost everyone possible."-

Hand said that Alpha Kappa Al-

pha.will travel to Shuman Center,
a detention home for juvenilles in
East Liberty, this weekend to or-
ganize an annual Halloween
party.

”We do it every year because
it fulfills our service project,” said
Hand. ”In addition, we try to in-
teract with the community.”

Swaray Kamara, president of
Pitt's Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity
said that his fraternity will co-
sponser the Halloween party.

Swaray also said that the
primary reason for Kappa Alpha
Psi’s lack of participation in
Greek Week was due to his
fraternity’s small membership.

”Out of all the other [Black] or-
ganizations [at Pitt], we havethe
biggest chapter, which is only 15
members,” said Kamara. ”lt’s a.

 

lot ‘easier for_the other [IFC] or-
ganizations to participate in
Greek Week. They can draw all
the blood pints, they have 100
arms to donate. We give blood
for blood drives but it's just a big
difference.”

Kamara said that Kappa Alpha
Psi has a high Q.P.A. standard
that all eligible pledges must ful-
fill. Though satisfied with this re-
quirement, he said that the
Q.P.A. standard limits the
amount of potential fraternity
brothers. ,

”lt's not like we don't try to par-
take inthe university or the IFC

.community,f' he said. ”lt’s just

our ‘resources are limited.
”We don't have a house so we

'can’.t‘sponser lFC—Greek Week
_‘ functions where the other [Greek] .

organizations can have that,” he
‘added.

According to Kamara, a frater-
nity house costs up to $100,000
and a minimum of 25 brothers is
required to sign a housing con-
tract. ”|t’s hard to do that when
you only have 15 or 20 mem-
bers,” he said. L - J _
' ”We participate with the IFC as
much as we can,” Kamara went
on to say. ’’If we had more num-
bers we would be able to take a
more active role [in IFC] simply
because we had more
manpower. '

,’.’They [Black fraternities] partic-
ipate [in IFC events] as far as In-
tramaurals,” said Guernsey. ‘fl
think the relationship [between
blackifraternites and the’IFC] is
pretty. good.’ Especially‘ compared“

”Gazing into the Crystal Ball” g 3 

is the theme for this year's

Homecoming, which officially ,

began yesterday with Pitt Nite

Out in Oakland and will con- 3
tinue through Saturday night with .

”We wanted to get people to

think of the third century, think- I
ing into the future, and also, with. . -

the crystal ball, look back _in
” said Craig Jackson, this
year's Homecoming chairperson.

”That’s why we wanted to use

the crystal ball. It incorporates

past, present, future and even. ,
Halloween. It really worked _out — A‘

well.” ‘ . ~
For the first Homecoming
event, Pitt Nite Out in Oakland,
local merchants gave 'ou_t"dis-
counts when students showed
anything with a Pittinsignia-.
’’It used to be called Beer and

Pizza, but with all the liabilities 

and things like that, now it's just
the Pitt Nite Out," said Jackson.
”We contacted the stores and
bars in Oakland and told them
about the mugs [Strohs donated»

3,500 mugs to give out during the-
election of Homecoming King.’

‘ and Queen] and asked them to

give extra discounts for these

mugs as well, and they did.“
Jackson said that the mugs may

have been the reason for the in-

crease in voting this year. This

year, 3,800 people voted as com-

they want to get involved [with

Kamara said that Kappa Alpha

Experts warn rough times unless imports reduc-ed

HARRISBURG — The United
States faces its worst trade crisis
ever, and steps must be taken to
boost exports and cut imports if
the American wayof life is to be
preserved, a businessman told a

state Senate committee Wed-

nesday.

”The U.S. is becoming a vast
warehouse for imported goods,"
said William J. Pendleton, direc-
tor of the International Trade Poli-
cy Task Force for the state

Chamber of Business and indus-

try. ”The standard of living is be-
ing affected, no question about
it."

Although the American econo-
my leads the world in job crea-
tion, most of the new jobs pay
less than $14,000, compared to
the $20,000- to $40,000-a-year
manufacturing jobs being lost.
Two million of the higher paying
jobs have disappeared from the
United States since 1980, Pendle-
ton said.

Reversing the post-World War
II economic experience, ”the
clear trend  is to lower level in-
come jobs,” he said. ”The ques-

Specter bill asks for

ter,‘ R-Pa., said Congress must
clarify the responsibilties of the
Central Intelligence Agency, the
National Security Agency and the
various intelligence elements in
themilitary.

”We have a choice,” Specter
said. ”We can preserve the status
quo and hope that the current
director of central intelligence --
and each of his successors —- will
understand the lessons of the
I ran-Contra affair. Or we can cre-
ate a better system of checks and
balances on covert action under-
takings.”

Specter’s legislation would cre-
ate two positions to replace the
current post of director of central
intelligence. _

One position-would be ”Direc-
tor of National Intelligence,”
responsible for overseeing the in-
telligence community and
providing the president with un-
biased reports on foreign activi-
ties. The other position, director
of the Central Intelligence Agen-
cy, would manage the operations
of the CIA.

Bill wants $19 million
to improve airports

WASHINGTON — Fourteen of
Pennsylvania's largest airports
would receive $19 million under
a Senate bill designed to allow
the nation's air travel system to
accommodate increasing num-
bers of passengers.

The money would finance rou-
tine activities such as runway im-
provements and hangar work. It
would come from a government
fund derived from taxes on airline
tickets, air freight and aircraft fuel.

The Senate has proposed
spending a total $1.6 billion na-

tionwide on the improvements.

Also in the bill is $1.5 billion for
modernizing air traffic control
equipment and $1.7 billion for
controllers’ and inspectors’ sa-
laries.

prove safety, convenience and

‘reliability, air travel requires a

Pitt alum a modern day patriot

Pitt alumnus Joe Burgo has
been described ‘by many as a
modern day patriot. The 1926
graduate of Pitt's School of Edu-
cation_ is recognized locally and
nationally for his knowledge of
history and political science and
his zeal in advancing patriotic
values and principles.

A retired teacher from the Pitts-
burgh Schoql-District, Burgo has
won the praise and admiration of
some of the nation's top political

. figures, including Senator'Arlen

Specter of Pennsylvania, and
South: ‘Carolina" Senator — Strom

Thurmond.

Burgo gets his message across
by writing letters to the editors of
newspapers. His opinions have
appeared frequently in Pittsburgh
area papers as well as The New
York Times. T

’’I am very pleased to see you
speaking out so forcefully on the
issue of the Panama Canal,” Se-
nator Thurmond once wrote him
in a formal letter. ”Your ex-

.perience has been similar to

mine. When people get the facts

Womanfrets about first—time
encounter with opposite sex

Q: I have read a number of
your columns in which you give
advice to virgins. It has given me
comfort, and also, I don't feel su-
perior to women who have cho-
sen another road. But I have a
persistent worry about not being
able to function sexually if and
when I do hook up with a man.

A: There is too much worrying
about being able to function sex-
ually before ever trying it. Lots of
people go into sex with a nice
partner and do not find it so hard.
it is not such a big deal, or doesn't
have to be. I advise you to read

Dough, sauce, sweat, cheese,
tears and an oven. Separate, they
sit, uselessly wasting untapped
potential. But put them togetherand
dammit, you have a pizza.

The origin at pizza is clouded be-
hind a myriad of superstitions,
myths, anonymities and wives’ tales;
however, through collective
research and painstaking computer
enhancement, the basic creation
and evolution at the modern day
pizza has been somewhat pin—
pointed,

Back in the early
shepherd's wite named Otella found
herself in aterrible predicament. The
annual ”testivale di pies," or testival
otpies was to be held the follow-
ing day, and_the woman was horri-
tied to find that her son Cesare had
inadvertently eaten the pie tilling she
had planned to make her dessert
with.

Over the years, the ”pizza” has
undergone many changes. The crust
has been flattened, toppings have
been added and at the touch of a
telephone now this circular God-
send can be brought to your home.

Capitalizing on the theory that
pizza plus famished collegiates
equals money, entrepreneurs have
established a veritable potpourri of
pizza shops in Oakland, designed
for satisfying the cravings of Pitt's
starving academicians; .

Pizza delivery is a big business‘ in ‘

Oakland. ‘Devoting itself entirely to
this idea, the Pizza Store offers a
unique delivery system for i-ts cus-
tomers. According to store owner
Jim Campolongo, the Pitt dorms ac-
count for approximately 600 pizzas
a week.

”l\lationally, ‘percentages say
that the most popular pizza is pep-
peroni,” he said. Between 92 and
93 percent of all their orders are for
pepperoni. ’

Complying with this, the Pizza
Store offers a $5 pepperoni special,
and in addition, the store's trucks

_ speeding up deliveries. .

have ovens where pizzas can be
radioed to specific houses, thus

On the average, ittakes l7 or l8
minutes for the Pizza Store to deliver
a pie. Campolongo contends that
this may be "why the college has
been so good to us.”

Stopping in at Napoli's, you can
find owner Tommaso Vairo spinning
pizzas made with the family recipe
from Italy.

The sit-down restaurant also fea-

tures a delivery; service and gets
business from the public, the univer-

sities and some of the Pittsburgh

based corporations.
After 20 years of pizza making,
Vairo echoes the Napoli motto that

”We are the first and still the best." .

Domino Pizza's Andy Buydasz ex-
plained that 35 to 40 percent of their
pizza are delivered to the area col-

" leges. in particular, he finds that the

”big three combo" of pepperoni,
mushroom and sausage is a big hit,
as well as the perenial ”large
plain."

Pittsburgh Steeler Louis Lipps or-

ders from Domino's and Buydaszf

said that the drivers feel he's a ”real
goodguy.” ‘ 

Receiving 50 percent of -their
profits from Pitt students, Fifth
Avenue's Pizza Hut offers a relax-
ing dining atmosphere for its"
tomers. , 

An October Pizza Hut surivey
merits the ”Pan Pizza with'peppero‘-
ni and mushrooms" as the overall
most popular order, said manager
Lisa Bonessi. : _

Pizza Hut has served to’n'ote-
worthy local athletes and celebrities
and is equipped with a large rear
dining room that is available for pri-
vate parties.

When, asked what pizza she
thought President Reagan might ord-
er if he stopped in, Bonessi chuck-
led and said, ”a Pan with

anchovies."

So whether you are a conserva— "

tive, plain pizza eater, or a daring
onions, ham and anchovies fan, it's
obvious that somewhere in Oakland

you will be able to find yourself a _

”slice of life." . _

LONDON — Syrian security
forces commonly inflict systemat-

,ic and cruel tortures on thousands

of political prisoners, including

people kidnapped in Lebanon

and Palestinians taken from refu--

gee camps, Amnesty Internation-

’aI said Wednesday.

In a statement with its 44-page
report, ”Syria: Torture by the
Security Forces," the worldwide
human rights organization said"
torture is a "regular experience
for political prisoners in Syria and
anyone suspected of opposing
the government of President Ha-

-fez Assad is at risk.”

" The report said many of those
seized in Syrian-controlled areas
of Lebanon were tortured there

vandthen transferred to Syria‘ for
-further interrogation and torture.

Those arrested in Lebanon in-
cluded hundreds of Palestinians

-handed over to the Syrians by the

Amal militia last February.

The report said all torture vic-
tims — students, lawyers, house-
wives and soldiers — have been
subjected to*~at least 35 different
methods of torture, often in spe-
cially e_quipped torture chambers.

» The tortures include electric
shocks and sexual abuse, the
report says.

Specially designed machines
are also used, it said.

It described the ”German
chair” in which victims are tied
by hands and feet to moving parts
of a metal chair, with a back rest
that bends, extending the spine
and putting severe pressure on

neck and limbs. It said the chair
can suffocate its victims.

The ”Syrian chair” also has me-
tal blades where the feet are tied,

cutting the ankles when pressure ‘

is applied, it said.

The ”washing machine” is a
hollow spinning drum into which
the arms are inserted; resulting in
arms or fingers being crushed, the
report said.

In other tortures described in
the report, victims are forced to
sit on hotstoves; salts and caus-
tic substances are applied to
wounds or burns; lips, ears and
noses are slashed with shaving
knives and razor blades; victims
are suspended from ceiling fans
and beaten as they rotate, and
relatives are tortured or sexually
assaulted in front of prisoners.

150 tourists trapped
during snowstorms

KATMANDU, Nepal —- A
snowstorm trapped about 150
tourists from North America, Eu-
rope and Japan in buses in the
mountains of Tibet, a Canadian
said Wednesday after he and
seven others spent five days hik-
ing to Katmandu for help.

”Many of the people stuck
there had no warm clothes. They
had no food except some ‘cham-
pa (millet flour) and no drinking
water,.” Fred Brooks told The As-
sociated Press.

He said the tourists were travel-
ing from Tibet's capital, Lhasa, to
Nepal aboard three buses when
the vehicles stalled in snow Oct.
19 on the Tibetan plateau.

China's official Xinhua News
Agency reported Wednesday that
more than 100 motor vehicles
carrying about 300 passengers,
including foreign tourists were
trapped on roads in southwest
Tibet after three days of snowfall,
but that most had been rescued
bylocal residents and troops who
cleared the highway. ‘

It said four people were'report-
ed to have frozen to death and
two had suffered frostbite, but
that the casualties did not include
any foreigners. The road was ex-

Prince of horror returns intime for Halloween

By Ike Shibley

Staff Writer

John Carpenter is one of the
best directors in the field of hor-
ror and suspense. He has direct-
ed The Fog, The Thing and
Chris.tine in addition to what will
be remembered as one _of the
quintessential horror films of all
time, Halloween.

With Halloween, Carpenter so-
lidified his place among the great
suspense directors. Working with
a budget of $300,000, he creat-
ed one of the scariest and well-

‘ crafted horror films ever made.

Carpenter has returned to the
realm of horror after a four year
hiatus in which he did a comic
science fiction movie, Big Trou-
ble in Little China, and a sen-
timental love story between an
earthling and an alien, Starman.

Prince of Darkness is his latest
effort, and it promises to scare all
who dare enter its hypnotic
realm. ' ‘

The plot is extremely interest-
ing. It centers on an abandoned
church in the middle of down-
town Los-Angeles. Here, a hand-
ful of graduate students and
scientists are hastily summoned
by a priest to learn the secret held
in a mysterious canister located
in the church's basement. The

‘canister contains an evil—looking

liquid that seems to be coming

-alive, generating an evil energy

from within ‘itself.

Donald Pleasance, a perennial
Carpenter actor, stars as the priest
who uncovers the terrifying secret
that propels the movie. Pleasance

has been seen as the psychiatrist ’

in Halloween and Halloween II
and as the president of the Unit-
ed States in Escape From New
York.

In this film, Pleasance is a ter-
rifying presence. Though he is a
priest, he is so devoutly commit-
ted to God that his fanatacism be-
comes frightening. to' the
audience and those around him.

Pleasance is the only character
who is clearly evident among a

rather bland cast. Parkerlameson A

The boss

FREEHOLD, NJ. (AP) — ”The
Boss” is indeed the boss.
Singer Bruce Springsteen ad-
mits he docked the pay of two
technicians because they didn't
meet his standards for his ”Born
in the USA” tour and to pay for
a canoe washed away in a storm.
But in court-papers filed last
week, Springsteen denies the two
were owed ”thousands of hours”
in overtime and asks that their
suit against him be dismissed.
Michael Batlan, a guitar tech-
nician who worked for Spring-
steen for 12 years, and Douglas
Sutphin, a musical coordinator
who spent 10 years with Spring-
steen, sued the singer in August.
Sutphin, of Long Branch, was
fired shortly after the 1984-85
tour and Batlan, of Ocean Town-
ship, quit. Their lawyer said they
were paid $50,000 a year each.
Batlan says his’pay was docked

$698.81 becausehe missed a cue

and Lisa Blount play lovers

-whose story is an annoying sub-

plot that a veteran director like
Carpenter should know to avoid.
Their love serves no purpose in
the movie other than to set up a
climactic ending that could have
been resolved as effectively
without the tension surrounding
the two lovers.

The specifics of the film are in-
triguing. Hundreds of bugs and
worms were used in the filming,
and all were real. The ants that
crawled on faces were likewise
real, the pinchers having been
surgically removed from the in-
sects so that they would not bite
the actors.

The differential equations that
were unearthed in an ancient text
found in the basement. of the
church were all real. They were
contributed by a master's candi-
date in nuclear physics.

The canister that held the green
slime (which is the only thing
green inythe entire film) of the
prince of darkness was created by
Carpenter himself from one origi-
nally used in a 1958 film called
Attack of the Puppet People.

Despite all the attention to de-
tail, there are-major gaps in the‘
story. Carpenter fails to explain
why a horde of burns would not
be noticed congregating around
an abandoned church in the mid-
dle ofa metropolis. He allows his
characters to remain oblivious of
the deaths around them when
there would seem to be no rea-
son that the smallband of stu-
dents would not keep better track
of one another.

There is the feeling that if any
normal person were in the film,
he would run long before they.
got close enough to be affected
by this green slime unlike the
characters in the film who keep
approaching until they are killed.

The‘ movie falter__s several times,
but in the final analysis, there is
a genuine feeling of terror. Car-
penter succeeds in his attempt to
scare the hell out of the audience.‘

Donald Pleasence seems has captured the Halloween spirit in the movie Prince of Darkness.

He had included the interesting
physical concept of anti—matter.
Carpenter has stated that ’’all the
physical principles used in the
film are true, including the theo-
retical ability of the subatomic
particles called tachyons to trav-
el backwards in time to save us
from the future.”

The premise is interesting, but

 

the progression of the details sur-
rounding the canister that has
contained a living entity for seven
million years is unorganized, thus
making it difficult to com-
prehend.

Another concept that is ex-
plored is the possibility for the
Roman -Catholic Church to keep
hidden the secret of the canister

since the time of Christ. The plau-
sibility of it is sure to spark con-
versation between- those who
view it.

Prince of Darkness is another

‘of John Carpenter's credits. It is‘

interesting subject matter.

hands out stiff penalties to workers

of taking $311.11 from each of
their paychecks to pay for a ca-

"THE" PITT NEWS, Thur_sdqy,“'Oc’rober 29, 1987

 

Billy Joel turns in his visa for a new album 

Billy Joel
Kohuept
Columbia Records

Billy Joel recently toured the
Soviet Union, in case you haven’t
heard, and the event was cap-
tured both on audio and
video-tape.

The concert footage premiered
on Home Box Office this month;
the concert was recorded on al-
bum and has been released in the
United States as Kohuept.

The album contains 16 songs dat-
ing back to his 1976 release of
Turnstiles. ”Angry Young Man”
is a song from that album, and the

New play‘
jars the
memory

By Rebecca Clothey
Staff Writer

Almost everyone has read at
least one Arthur Miller play in
high school, probably Death ofa
Salesman. The City Theatre is
currently running one of Miller's
latest works, entitled Danger:

.ln‘each of his plays, Miller has

consciousness to one theme, and
40 years after Death of a Sales-
man, his work still has an impact.

Miller's latest play, Danger:
Memory!, is a combination of
two one—act plays, each with a
completely different set of
characters and a different plot.

the dangers of forgetting and of
remembering.

The first act is the story of an
elderly man and woman who
have beenfriends for many years.
The entire act consists of their dis-
cussion of the past. The woman
copes with pain at the loss of her
husband, Frederick, by pretend-
ing that she remembers nothing
about him.

The man, who was best friends
with Frederick, does exactly the
opposite. He copes with his pain
by remembering everything
about him. In fact, practically the
only thing he ever talks about is
Frederick. ,

The second act is similar in that
it is almost completely a dialogue
between two actors; in this case,
it's a police officer who is inter-
rogating a man about the murd-
er of his daughter, Clara. It is
painful for him to recall much of
Clara's life, since he is still block-
ing the death from his mind.

The possible consequence of
his not remembering important
facts, such as the name of a pos-
sible suspect, is obvious —
Clara's murder may never be
resolved. 9

This play concerns itself with
thought—provoking topics. Not
only does it demonstrate the vi-
tality of memory in certain situa-
tions, but it also brings up social
issues such as racism, leaving the
audience with a lot to think
about.

The acting and directing in
both productions is solid;

however, there is very little action
in either one. The story weaves
itself from the dialogue, and
therefore, runs the risk of becom-

 

one he opens up this live album
with following a chant called
”Odoya” performed by, The Ge-
orgian Singers.

It is symbolic of Joel's view of
Russia. He seems to think that the
country is inhabited by a popu-

vlation of angry young men.

Before beginning ”Allentown,”
Joel said, ”This song is about the

‘people living in Northeastern

Pennsylvania who are depressed
because all the steel mills are
closing down. They stay because
they were taught that things will
get better  Maybe that sounds
familiar.” He "seems to want to
make more of a statement by

ing dull.

n - ' 1 . 4‘
-4 3-. .“_,g- .. . -

touring the country than provid-
ing entertainment.

He sings ”Goodnight Saigon”
after introducing it as a song dedi-
cated to his friends who fought in
Vietnam.

Kohuept works best when Joel
simply plays his hits and dis-
penses with the politics. Songs
like ”A Matter of Trust,” ”An ln-
nocent Man,” ”Big Shot” and
”Only the Good Die Young”
sound refreshingly vibrant onthe
disk. He also includes two songs
(in addition to ”A Matter of '
Trust") from his latest studio al-
bum The Bridge that are among
this critic's least favorites -

 
 

 

«'..~--r.p.' '....*~ 3; '44 '

”Baby Grand” and ”Big Man on
Mulberry Street.” I am still puz-
zling over why he opted to play
them on his tour when he had
much more potent songs to
choose from, i.e. ”This is the
Time” and ”Code of Silence.”

One of the nicest suprises on
this album was that every selec-
tion did not include 30 seconds
of cheering fans like many live al-
bums include to convince the
listener that the songs really were
recorded live.

Joel improvised on many of his
songs so that the live'version is
different, but not always better,
than the recorded version.

 

 

 

 

     

 at-past.  _

There are two songs that Joel
covers at the end of the album.

' One is appropriately ”Back in the

U.S.S.R.” and the other is Bob
Dylan's ”The Times They are A
Changin’.” The latter selection is
prefaced by Joel sayinggthat the
song had been running around in
his head since his arrival in Rus-
sia. Both songs are admirable
reflections of their originals.
This is not a collection of Billy
Joel's greatest hits recorded live.
It is a compilation of what was an
important tour of the Soviet Un-
ion by one of America's premier

musicians. _ Ike Shibley

The war should be
against intolerance

‘The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Pornography has accused
a Squirrel Hill video store of distributing pornography, according

I to a story in yesterday's Pittsburgh Press. The charges stem from

a collection of 400 or so tapes in a restricted room of the store.

We have to wonder what could. be the harm in distributing
sexually oriented videos to people of legal age. The Coalition
has suggested that a jury examine the contents of the videos
to decide "whether they violate pornography laws.

If the morality of a certain faction of the population doesn't
wish to be exposed to pornography, we would suggest that they
discontinue their scrutiny of the videos.

Thegroup complained of the "suburbanization of pornog-

raphy,” which seems to imply that pornography is acceptable '

so long as it is confined to the city. An interesting statement,
that. The "So long as I don't find it in my backyard, I have no
objections” syndrome —— merely intolerable intolerance.

In a nutshell 

That's what Ollierhas not picked up on.
He deplores terrorists, yet he hasn't no-
ticed that he is a terrorist. Terrorism is
as bad as he thinks it is, and he should
stop doing it. S , g . r

For me, meeting Steve Hansen,
of ”Jimmy & Steve” fame, for the
first time was a lot like meeting
God. He seemed kind enough.

' But howthe hell was I supposed

to know what to make of him?
The meeting took place a little
more than five years ago in a

-video editing booth at Warner

Cable's old QUBE facility in
Pittsburgh. '

It was my first day as a summer
intern. Steve and my mentor,

exuded no air of cockiness or.
celebrity. If anything, he was shy
and unassuming. He acted almost
embarassed by what he saw on
the video monitors, though Doro-
thy and I laughed enough for all
three of us. But deep down, I

knew Steve loved what he saw,

His occasional grins told me well
enough. And I loved the prospect
of working with him.

That summer was ‘no bummer. .
We had lots of -fun doingrzany

David Letterman does it, Bill-
board does it, and now I'm going
to do it.

So now, I present to you, the
top 10 people most likely to hold
aid—concerts to benefit starving
people" and those with other
needs: _ I

10) Anybody on the Nashville
Network — OK, so it's more than
one, person, but think about it.

“They all weigh‘ about’ 500

pounds, wear glitter in their hair
and can crochet. Imagine the size
of theafghans they're going to
make. They'll bring in good
money. And they'll sparkle. I
9) Prince — Even pimps have
hearts. For a small fee, you'll be
able to have your way with Shee-
na, Appolonia, Vanity, Sheila,
Wendy and Lisa. But I don't
know how charitable Prince
would be, considering he'd prob-
ably want 95 percent of the take.
8) Crispin Glover — There's
really a market for the kind of
gross stuff this man could auction
off. Take his diseased eye collec-

things we loosely referred to as
”work.” I celebrated my 21st
birthday, and Steve and I became
friends, as we've been ever since.

Given this background, no one
was happier than I when word
leaked the duo was coming back
to Pittsburgh. After only a hand-
ful of months, the gig at WSHE-
FM in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-, went
bust and Jimmy & Steve were
homeward bound, this time to
WMYG-FM in Braddock. Many
people were surprised. I saw it
coming.

Last February, I traveled
through Florida, visiting a num-
ber of beach towns and cities.
When I stopped in Fort Lauder-
dale, Steve was the consummate
host and put me up for a few
days. What a revelation.

Staying at Steve's condo in
midwinter, as anyone from the
Northeast could understand, was
a treat. At first, I couldn't under-
stand what was going on. Why
did, Steve.not likethis reasonable
facsimile of paradise? He never‘

child handy to use.

5) Bob Eubanks — With “all the
attention Wink Martinda|e's been
getting lately, he should be get-
ting pretty desperate. He was
born to do something like this.

'4) Goldilocks — The girl wasa
freeloader, and she slept around,
OK? What a gimmick. I'm sure
that one’s never been used before
to promote an aid-concert.

but I could tell something was
wrong.

Steve's decorating had a dis-
tinctive bohemian touch to it —
kind of like he left most every-
thing he owned at his home back
in Pittsburgh. The walls of his»
new ‘condo, all new and clean,

cwere bare. A lone table stood in
the dining area, its only purpose
being to support the,lap—top com-
puter Steve used for writing.

As far as I could tell, Steve had
but one plate, one knife, one
spoon, one fork and one drinking
glass in the place. Granted, the
guy's a bachelor, but was this the

‘lifestyle of a man who was

settling in? Was it the lifestyle of
a man who is happy with his sit-
uation and committed to a new
life? Not on yours. I didn't know
this for certain until the next
evening.

That night, I accompanied
Steve to a nightclub where his
station was throwing a promo-
tional bash. Much of the action

  
   

  It's been a hard day-'5 night..-

tion, for instance. -A
7) _and 6) Billy Joel and Christ
Brinkley — Marital Aid is always

in need. They even have a poster ’
3) Whitney Houston — Too"
- much cuteness is unbecoming of _

anyone. She picks her nose just
like everybody else. But'she’d

bring in a lot more money doing ’

it than anybody you know.
2) Nancy Reagan — This wom-

an's got more apple in her eye. I“ ‘ 

than David Crosbyhas drug con-
victions. She was a born charity

fund raiser..Wou|dn't it be great

to see her do a duet with Tina
Turner? '

1) Marilyn McCoo — I know;  :7

this is really weird. But she
bothers me. The woman bothers
me. That's all I can really say. She
just bothers me. Maybe after

she's completed her contract with. »_ . __.
Solid Gold, she can hitchup with " ’

Pia Zadora for a one-time concert
to benefit people who can't get
recording contracts anymore and
have to do things like host pop-
tune programs. -

Did I have a meetingtwith God? Naw, justjimmy   

tinctly than any other part of the l 

event, I remember a rock group

made up of men of rather small ‘V  '3

stature called "TaI|ucci." This lit-
tle rock ensemble laid down the
Jimmy & Steve theme song about
as well as I've ever -heard, and I

thought to myself— "Maybe this X 
is what it's all about now. To live. - r;

is to change, you know. Maybe
this change will be good for Steve
and the duo."

Not long after this thought:

crossed my mind, something else

crossed my path: a trio of fans — . j
two guys, one girl — and one of _

them was wearing a WDVE T-

shirt. At that point, everything be- V ’ I‘

came clear.
So here we are moving toward

the holidays, and the guys are A 

back in town and on the ain/vaves
again. On _top of that, Jimmy &
Steve are also on the tube with a

It's that time of year, when the dogs
howl more ominously and black cats ap-
pear out of nowhere. The spooks, ghosts
and goblins stalk the night. It's scary and
fun. Serious party-goers dress up (and
some even dress down). The less ex-
perienced wait until the last minute,
frantically searching for Halloween
costumes.

This time, even last-minute hunters can
pull together a costume comparable to
even the best-dressed.

From Shakespeare to the '60s, gowns
to galoshes, costumes can be bought for
prices ranging from 50 cents to_$10. The
sale takes place Oct. 29 to 30 at the
Stephen Foster Memorial social room.
The Pitt theater arts department is put-
ting out old costumes for the public to
buy. All that needs to be done is a little
creative mixing and matching. Voila! A
Halloween costume that costs little but
looks like a million.

THE PITT NEWS

The University of Pittsburgh
Lady Panther volleyball team
now owns the longest winning
streak in the country. With its 3-0
win over Duquesne on Monday
night, Pitt ran its consecutive
match—winning streak to 22. It is
the longest win streak of any Di-
vision I women's volleyball team.

The last time the Lady Panthers
suffered a setback was back on

Sept. 19 against sixth—ranked,

For

Nebraska. Included in the win-
ning streak.were key wins over
Tennessee twice, Penn State,
Houston, Miami and Florida.

With no further matches sched-
uled this month, it means the
Lady Panthers finished the month
with an unblemished record and
an overall record of 30-2.

An at-large bid to the NCAA
tournament is becoming more
and more realistic for -Shelton

Caliguire,

hard work   has
paid dividends

By Christopher Sepesy
Staff Writer

Things have certainly been
looking up for sophomore offen-
sive lineman Dean Caliguire.

First, he's off the injury list,
which at one point he seemed
almost prone to be on. ,

Secondly, he's been getting
honest looks from his coaches
even though he's only a sopho-
more, something which would
make any sophomore player hap-
py anywhere in the country.

And thirdly, and this is the ac-

complishment of which he said

he is the most proud, he's start-
ing at left guard for the Panther
team this year.

”I was really trying hard for that
position,” said Caliguire. ”Going
into camp‘ this past summer, all

I could keep telling myself was_

how much I really wanted it, and
if I worked hard enough that I
would get it.

”Well, my hard work paid off,
and there I am in the starting
lineup,’’ he continued. ’ A

Caliguire saw only a litle action
last year on the line, and he said
this dismayed him. ”I really want-
ed to do more, but the coaches
wanted me to wait because they
really hadn't seen anything real-
ly big from me," he said.

But when last season ended, he
said he decided he would work
his best to secure the position he
has now. —

season than I ever had in my en-

For The Pitt News

Junior offensive guard Mark
Stepnoski is not the first Pitt line-
man up for All-America honors -
and he probably won't be the last

— but he has been called one of r

the best ever to play on the offen-
sive line for the Panthers.

Last year, as a sophomore,
Stepnoski was voted third-team
All-American by Football News,
and the same magazine named

him to its first-team sophomore A

All-America roster. -
Going into this year, Stepnoski

. was selected, :a..'g.rese,ason,x AII-,.-.;.:,

tire life,” he said. ”I started work-
ing out a lot with Buddy Morris
— he worked with me a great
deal. I worked out.a lot with peo-
ple like Bill Fralic, Emil Boures
and Jim Sweeney, and that really
helped me out a lot."

Caliguire also has seen playing
time in the backfield, but he said
the position he holds is the one
he prefers.

”When I was playing the back-
field, it was almost like it seemed
the coaches didn't know where
to put me,’T he said. ”But now
that I'm playing at guard, I think
I'm able to contribute to the team

I a lot better.”

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
said he feels Caliguire has come

i a long way from when he first

saw him.

”Dean has really improved as
a player,” said Gottfried. ”He has
so much heart in the game that
he really has shown us he be-
longs where he is. And the best
part about it is that he has bigger
and better things coming up.

. We're going to see a lot of things

from Dean, you wait and see.”

Caliguire said the loss of right
guard and All-America candidate
Mark Stepnoski for four games
hurt the team a little, but for the

most part, the offense was able to’

hold its own. But he is happy that
Stepnoski is returning this
weekend to face Syracuse. ,
”With him back it can only
help,”.he said. ”-You know, hav-
ing an All-American on your

American by the same magazine,
while Sporting News ranked him
as the eighth best offensive guard
in the country.

Despite all the attention he's
received, the 6-foot-3, 255-pound
Stepnoski is taking his star status
rather lightly. ”I just go out and
play," he said:--”| can't pay a lot
of attention to Al|—America scouts
and charts. I just try to live up to
my own and my coaches’ expec-
tations.”

Those expectations have re-
mained at the same level all year,
even though; Stepnoski was in-

.,ju.red- in theseason opener at I

    

 
 

  
 

Collier’s players.

”I have told my team that if we
qualify for the national tourna-
ment, it will be my most reward-
ing accomplishment ever as a
coach,” Collier said. ”It will take
a near-perfect season to do it,
with about I 10 teams competing
for two available spots from our
region, but so far, we are having

that kind of year.\These players '

deserve it.”

Leading the way for Pitt in the‘ '

 

”| sprained my ankle, and our
trainer said it was a six-week in-
jury. Obviously, I couldn't afford
to be out that long, so I played
without giving the ankle enough
time to heal, and I re-injured it,”
Stepnoski said,

Stepnoski sat out the fourth
game of the season — at West
Virginia — to allow his ankle time
to heal. "I feel a lot_ better now,"
he said, "although“it’s [his ankle]

still not 100 percent”. I have to_
tape up before every? gaimoe, and -.

I also wear a brace.”

The Lady Panthers next match
will be at the Ohio State Classic
on Nov. 7. The first match will be
against Ohio State, Collier’s alma
mater, where he was an All-
American in 1977. The second

he called his best game of the
yean ' ,

”The Boston College game was
definitely the best game individu-
ally ‘and collectively this year on
the offensive line, even though
we lost,” he said.

*j£,The defending Big East cham-
pion men's and women's swim-
rning teams kick off their season
tomorrow night at Trees _Ha||
against Duquesne.
. ' ”We_should be fairly balanced
and in pretty good shape this
year. We're a young team, but
the freshmen are doing really
V well,” said women's‘ coach
' David Belowich.
_|n most college sports, fresh-

doesn't believe swimming is one

behind when All-America
freestyler Sue Hickman graduat-

with Sue and Laure so far this
year,” said Belowich.

Tricia Rickert is another
sprinter Belowich will be looking
to. ”Tricia can sprint very well.
She made the NCAA relay team
last year, and is a 10th of a se-
cond or two off the school record
held by Amy Jackson, a 20-time

Belowich feels that the distance
events are as strong as they've
ever been, including when
Olympian Sue Heon was here.

This spot will be filled by co—°

be the primary backstroker. Back-
ing her upwill be Lauren, a fresh-
man from Peters Township,
Cassidy, Makill and Sori,

Breaststroke is the one event
where Belowich feels that the
depth is not as strong as it should
be. Junior Maureen Cleary and
sophomore Josette Prolsser are
both doing well, and both have
the opportunity to move up and
take charge, Belowich said. He
also looks to freshmen Kim
Sivitarese and Julie Levri to help
out.

\Senior Judy Haughton, three-
time winner of the 200—yard but-
terfly in.Big East competition, will
be the top swimmer in butterfly.
if she wins that event at the Big
East championships this year, she
will be the second person ever to
win an event four years in a row.
The first was Pitt's Sue. Hickman.

Also swimming butterfly will
be Laure Walczak, last year's
champion in the 100-yard event,
and freshman Kara Moxie. ’’Kara

' will add tremendous depth in this

area. She's really improving and

still just scratching the surface of

her ability,” said Belowich.
Sophomore Pam Murphy,

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 29,- T987

another butterflier, will miss this
meet due to an injury to her wrist.
”She’s got some problems with
her wrist. We'll make a decision
about her after she goes to see a
hand specialist,” said Belowich.

Belowich also feels he has the
strongest group of divers he's
ever had. ”Tricia Ney is back
from knee surgery and looking as
good as she's ever looked in Oc-
tober,” said Belowich. Ney, a
senior, qualified for NCAAs her
junior..year.

Other divers include Margie
Paulick, who emerged as NO. 1
last year in 'Ney’s absence, Can-
dy Yackmack, a sophomore, and
freshman Kim Strawbridge.

The main goal of the men's
team in this meet will be to
‘switch people around to try and
find the best lineup. ”We have a

lot of spots to fill in. This is al

chancelfor us to see how our guys
are performing,” said men's
coach Dick Bradshaw.

Top returning sprinters Tim
Adams and Scott Jeffries will be
handling that position, along with
sophomore Bill Folger.

’’Bill is having a good early sea-
son so far,” said Bradshaw. ’/He

Swimmers ready to make waves this year

did very well in the intersquad
meet._”

Charlie Frye along with Rob
Monte and Dan Langan will
swim the distance freestyle.

Senior Jodi Pfister, also a
freestyler, will be looking forward
to what Bradshaw hopes will be
his best season, if preseason
workouts are to be indicative of
his performance.

Senior Geoff Rife will be swim-
ming butterfly along with NCAA
qualifier senior Jim Emore.

Emore will be joined by senior
Rob Reddy to cover the back-
stroke events. ’

”We have a question in breast-
stroke. Sophomore John Arkens
has been doing very well,” said
Bradshaw.

One promising freshman is
Steve Goth. ”He’s looking to dis-
tance but can sprint. He looks
promising in practice. I am hop-
ing for him to go to the Big East
and be a" point scorer for us,” said
Bradshaw.

One big problem facing Brad-
shaw in his first year as head

_coach is the lack of a strong fresh-

man class. All freshmen are

walk—ons.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 29, I987

Auburn’s hands full to

By Vince Longo

' Staff Writer

As the college football season
heads into the home stretch, the
team in the most unenviable po-
sition is the sixth—ranked Auburn
Tigers. This week, the Tigers host

' Florida, and it doesn't get any

easier with Florida State, Georgia
and Alabama looming on the
horizon. All four teams are Top
20, with Florida State checking in_
at No. 4.

The team with a favorable
schedule is the Syracuse Orange-
men. lfthe Orange can get by Pitt
this Saturday in Pittsburgh, an
I 1-0 record is a very good possi-
bility. Navy, Boston College and
West Virginia remain for the
Orangemen after Pitt and, while
West Virginia is rapidly improv-
ing, the ’Eers must play them in
the Dome. Boston College also
must travel to Syracuse. Unfor-
tunately, a lack of respect for

Eastern football (relative to the I

SEC, Big-10 or Pac-10) and the
absence of a winning tradition at
Syracuse in recent years would
keep an 1 1-0 Syracuse team from
naming their bowl, unless Miami
loses to Notre Dame.

Last week — 14-2

For the year — 59-23

and that might just carry us over

win or lose, we're going to give
them a good fight,” he said.

For now, Caliguire said he
plans to continue to keep gun-
ning for the offense. And again,
he still keeps going up.

”I know’|’ve improved a lot
since I first went into this posi-
tion, and I think I'm holding my
own pretty good,” he said.
”Maybe I'm not the best yet, and-
I still have a long way to go. But

ing for all educational |evels.”'
Currently, he resides in Forest

Hills where he continue_s to V

preach American patriotism. ”I
love talking,” he said. ’’I’m al-
ways talking.” And patriotism is

the main topic of conversation .

when Joe Burgo is around.
”Our flag is the greatest,” Bur-
go said. ”Our country is the
greatest. Top people in the coun-
try are always downgrading our

country. I have to correct them

with the facts.”

In recognition of his patriotism,
Burgo was named ”Citizen of the
Year” for 1983 in Forest Hills and
was awarded the George
Washington Honor Medal by the
Freedoms Foundation in 1979

' ”for outstanding achievement in

bringing about a better under-
standing of the American way of
Iife.” ‘
His talents are not limited to
speech and writing, however.
Burgo is one of the most respect-
ed authorities in the Pittsburgh
area on the subject of gardening.
He is a prominent member of the
Pittsburgh Men's Garden Club.
Burgo taught World History,
World Geography, and English at
Oliver High School prior to

retirement.

conditioning coach in the coun-
try. He does an excellent job.”

Meyers had nothing but praise
for Stepnoski as well. ”He’s a
good, good football player and a
very bright guy, a student of the
game. He's got a lot of motivation
and does a lot of work. He should
be considered for All-America
teams despite his injury. He's
definitely a viable contender.”

Stepnoski’s injury has definite~
ly put a damper on his personal
season, though. ”I haven't been
healthy, and it's been very frus-
trating. I just have to try to stay
healthy for the rest of the
season.”

Stepnoski said his injury has
cost him a chance at making any
AII—America teams, but he still
thinks the team can go far this
year, despite two losses by a to-
tal of six points to Boston College

.The opponents goal, the final
resting place.

This-is the story of the Pitt soc-
cer team's unending quest to ex-
plore strange new territory, to
seekout the scoreboard, to bold-

ly__ go where precious few have
‘gone before. '

But last night in front of a Pitt

_ Stadium soccer record atten-

dance crowd of a whopping 402
people, the Panthers succumbed
1-0 to the Carnegie-Mellon Tar-
tans in the last home game of the

A season.

CMU shu

”We definitely had enough
chances,” said Pitt head coach
Joe Luxbacher. ”We changed a
few people around tonight, trying
to find a combination that would
work. It is very frustrating.”

The only score of the game
came with 27:30 left in the first
half. Off of a side kick by 'CMU’s
Kevin Jung, Mike Rudolf headed
the ball past Pitt goalie Mark Hen-
dricks to give the Tartansaone

goal "lead they would never’

relinquish. ,

”This was a tough Ioss,’—.’ said
Pitt senior Mike Grimes, playing
in his last game at Pitt Stadium.

year, but we just can't get it
done!’ '

From that point on, the game
was filled with many questions.
Could Pitt continue to dominate
the game, yet still lose? Could the
large crowd push the players to
new heights? How much colder
would it actually get out there?

”This game was the same as
the rest of them,” said Pitt's Jon
Ascher. ”We dominated the ball,

but the one mistake sunk us. ’
.Bryan Hammond dominated the

middle for us.--We just couldn't

.put the ball in the net.”

Pitt was able to outshoot CMU
26-5 throughout the game, yet
the play of the Tartan goalie al-
ways turned them back. ,

.’’I’m really dissapointed it had
to end this way,” said Pitt senior
Dave Moss. ’’It was close, but we
just can't get over the top."

Some of the more exciting mo-
ments came off the field. With
about 10 minutes left in the first
half, the ball was «kicked into the
stands behind the Pitt goal. Sud-
denly a mass of kids, at the game
for youth night, ran towards the
ball in a race for life. When the
winner finally threw the ball
back, the record crowd erupted
into applause. '

”I think the team played well,”
said Erim Gude of Pitt. ”The mid-
field dominated the ball, we just
can't put it in. Overall, we did
play a good game.”

The Panthers now have two
road games left in this 3-9-1 sea-
son. Pitt plays at Villanova Satur-
day and IUP Tuesday.

PREGAME

PITT VS. SYRACUSE

PITT STADIUM, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

McPherson gives 0

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1987, 2:45 PM.

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Whoever thought it would come to this?

At the beginning of the season, it seemed that
Notre Dame and national champion Penn State
would be the major challenges in the Panther
schedule. But after Syracuse knocked off Penn
State 48-21 before a national audience, they
were beginning to be taken seriously.

Syracuse enters this weekend's game with an
unblemished 7-0 record, making them the
eighth—best team in the country. Even Syracuse
head coach Dick MacPherson seems to be a lit-
tle surprised at how well the Orangemen have
done this year.

”With the schedule we've played, we have
to be grateful. We're fortunate to be 7—0," he
said. ”We're pleased and humble about it."

Syracuse's wins have come at the expense of
Maryland (25-11), Rutgers (20-3), Miami of
Ohio (24-10), Virginia Tech (35-21), Missouri
(24-13), Penn State and Colgate (52-6).

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried can't seem to
find one weakness in this team, a thought which
leaves him very concerned. A
”Syracuse is a Top 5 team. They're good with
their offense. They have running backs who can
run depth in positions and receivers who can
run all the way. I'm very impressed.

"They have no apparent weaknesses on the
films. You can see what they've done against
Penn State,” Gottfried added.

When it comes to the Orangemen's passing
game, senior quarterback Don McPherson gives
the offense an added dimension.

ffense added dimension

McPherson has completed 85 of his 1-I5 pass-
es (58.6 percent) for 1,309 yards and 1-1 touch-
downs (school record) and has thrown seven
interceptions. He has also carried 70 times this
season for 68 yards. Granted, ()8 yards may not
seem like much, but for a quarterback, it's a lot,
and for opposing defenses, it's too much.

McPherson has turned the option play into an
art, and he's put it on display all year. He's be-
ing touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate this
season for his impressive numbers and for help-
ing Syracuse with its best starting season since
1959, when it won the national championship.

"They're playing with confidence, and often-
sively, they play so well. McPherson can make
it happen," said Gottfried.

But as Gottfried said before, there are no
weaknesses he can see, and this includes
defense.

"Defensively, they are leading [the nation]
against the rush, and we're a rushing team," said
Gottfried.

Syracuse's defense has given up an average
of 79.5 yards rushing per game. Pitt junior Craig
”lronhead" Heyward, also a candidate for the
Heisman, is averaging 131.4 yards per game,
placing him third in the country. Whether Hey-
ward can continue his string of seven consecu-
tive 100-yard games may determine the fate of
the Panthers.

However, Gottfried knows it's going to take
an enormous effort to beat the Orangemen, a

task he hopes the Panthers will be able to

accept .
"Offensively, we're struggling, and injuries

have hurt us, but we have to come up with a

game plan against these people," said Gottfried.
