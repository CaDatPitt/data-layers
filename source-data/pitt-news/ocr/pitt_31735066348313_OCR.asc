BY BILL MOORE

Tentative plans are being formu-
lated to shift student programming
activities from the Student Union
Annex back to the Student Union,
according to Student Affairs Assis-
tant Vice-Chancellor William Mar-
kus.

“lhis whole thing is still under
discussion,” Markus said. “There
have been a couple of meetings

 ‘where we have discussed the
ﬁlﬁbssibility of giving up the Annex,
but that hinges upon our having
some additional amenities in the
Student Union.’_’.
‘Those additional amenities, Mar-
kus explained, include better utili-
zation of existing facilities, perhaps
additional janitorial help, and re-
novation of the Pine Room in the
wdent Union basement.

 ' arkus estimated the costs would
be “minimal” for renovation of the
Pine Room.

“We feel we can accomodate.

‘ functions‘ previously held in the

Annex in the Union if we do these
things,” he said. A

Markus said it was important to
effect a "better turnover" of
Student Union space, noting the
extensive time needed to set up
and take down the large wooden
tables used in the ballroom and
Kurtzman room. “If we have the ta
-bles set up in the morning and
someone needs 100 chairs set up
for the afternoon, we can’t do it,"
he said.

The» Annex will probably be
turned over to Dr. Attilio Favorini,
of the Speech and Theatre Arts
department, for holding theater
courses, according to Markus.
“That depends on if these things
all fall into place,” he added.

He said _a meeting will be held in
the near future to discuss the cost
of the change-over and said he
expected a final decision shortly
after that meeting. Representatives

from Student Affairs, Student Ac-

Student Government
programming committee chairman
Chip Cipcic objected to the plans
saying _“We could hold the activi-
ties in the Student Union, but not
with the same type of atmo-

- "I really have no choice but to

won’t be the same; the Annex is a

l( to SU? 4 Pilf Students Nabbed

In Brackenridge Dorm Bust,"

Allegheny County police ofﬁcials
arraigned four Pitt students last
night on alleged possession of
marijuana after searchinga third--
ﬂoor Brackenridge Hall residence.

According to city court officials,
the students involved were charged

with alleged possession of “a small

amount of marijuana.”
The four were released on $1000

_surety bond posted by two repre-

sentatives of Pitt\SG Legal Aware-
ness Committee, to await a hearing
before city magistrate Nicholas
Diulus on December 12. .

While campus pOIlCe were pre-
sent, county ofﬁcials made the
actual arrest, police said. The raid
occured around 3 pm~Tuesday
afternoon. -

The campus‘ police officers invol-
ved were Denny Cavazza and
Detective Arnie Foreman, accord-
ing to a police spokesman.

At the preliminary hearing, Ma-
gistrate Diulus will decide whether
to hand the case over to a grand
jury or drop charges after hearing
both sides.

 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
 
    
   
   
 
 
 

The possibility also exists that,
charges will be brought against the
four students by the Campus
Judicial Board.

In a similar raid on September 14, 
six McCormick Hall residents were 
arrested by county police for pos- ,
session of marijuana. Two of the 
students were additionally charged .
with possession with intent to sell; 

Charges were dropped against the V A
four charged with only possession,
while the two charged with intent.’ ‘A
to sell are still awaiting trial.  _

If the four students arrested last’ -
night are faced with Judicial board, 
charges, they will have the option 5
of a hearing before a panel of ﬁve _
students or a special hearing _

‘‘It is so bad that I can't
psychologically handle it, so I pour
myself into graduate school and
come out with a job with security.
There is no security in rebellion.”

William Kunstler, defense lawyer
for the Attica Brothers and noted
civil liberties attorney, spoke to
approximately 200 people, mostly
Pitt students, last week in
Benedum Auditorium. Kunstler
told of his experiences at Wounded
Knee and Attica, and spoke of the
“constant struggle against a world
that is cold, is cruel, and is
indecent.”

' “But I understand, because to

- sink into grad school is only to try

to save your sanity in this world.
lthink it is the wrong way, but now
I understand it.”

Kunstler spoke slowly and dis-
tinctly to the attentive crowd,
appealing to his audience as he
might to ajury, Kunstler, rather for
the conviction of the society he
termed “indecent.”

He spoke of rebellion as the

natural and inevitable reaction of '

Kunstler spoke of the Weather-
men——the leftist group which
gained noterietyﬁin the 60s——and
appealed to them to “keep on
doing what you're doing.”

The 1972 Attica prison takeover,
Kunstler said, was an example of
the rebellion he saw as inevitable.
“They said they wanted to live as
men, and if‘ they couldn’t live as
men, they weren’t going to die as
animals.” _

“No‘one gives a damn for those
who lack all power,” he continued.
“The only way I know that has any
measure of success is the threat of
disruption or disruption itself.
When all avenues have been
explored and closed, people have a
moral right to rebel. The Attica
prisoners had no other way.”

Kunstler is defending the two

Berry said. The Campus Police also

' answered the call.

The cause of the fire was un-
known, and Berry said the Univer-
sity would continue its investiga-
tion this morning. He said it was
too early to tell if arson might have
been involved, but added the fire
may have started in the kitchen.

“in order to properly quench the
embers, a wall and part of the
ceiling had to be taken down,” said
Berry. "Most of the damage was
done by smoke and soot, and 50%
of the kitchen was burned out."

Berry noted that the ‘building

has been vandalized and broken
into in the past. I

Attica prisoners on trial for the
murder of prison guard William
Quinn, one of the first of 43 men to
die in the September 9-13, 1971,
prison takeover. The attorney said
his clients were on trial “for the
murder of the only correctional

officer who was not killed by State p

Troopers.”

“Attica was one of the bloodiest
encounters between Americans
since the Civil War,” Kunstler
said.

The 52-year old attorney slowed
his speech when he spoke of the
Attica deaths. He told the
audience of the Attica prisoner’s
request that Nelson Rockefeller,

zthen Governor of New York, come

to Attica and sign a document
guaranteeing the prisoner’s rights.

“Had that been done, had
Rockefeller come, 43 humans
would be alive today,”_ Kunstler
said. “But he refused to do it.”

Kunstler’s speech touched on
Watergate, and the possible ap-
pointment of Rockefeller as vice-
president. “We are about to
conﬁrm a murderer as vice-presi-
dent of the United States. You
would think we would have learned
something from Watergate,” he
said.

Kunstler criticized the American
obsession with the bugging of the
Democratic headquarters and the
cover-up, terming them “totally
inconsequential,” and expressed
disappointment that Americans did
not react as strongly to “the
murdering of the Vietnamese
people and the brothers at Attica”
saying both were “swept under the
carpet as if they don’t exist.”

The Attica trial is consuming the
majority of Kunstler’s time now-
he could only spare slightly more
than an hour to speak at Pitt—but

. in the past he has defended the

Chicago Seven, Stokely Car-
michael, Adam Clayton Powell, PH.
Rap Brown, and ,Daniel Berrigan,
and was involved deeply with the

Attica rebellion.

negotiations during the 1973
Wounded Knee takeover.

Kunstler devoted half his speech
to Wounded Knee, and spoke of
the plight of the American Indian
with passion. He compared the
Wounded Knee incident with the
“The drive is
exactly the same. When there is no
way to go, when there is no outlet,
people have the natural right to
rebel.”

“At Wounded Knee, a people
who were on the verge of
extinction, perhaps our most
endangered species, the American
Indians, had reached a point where
they had to act,” he said. “The
Indians at Wounded Knee were a
people of despair, a people reduced
to selling blankets on the street, a
people who talked of past glory but
could only see despair.”

Kunstler related the details of the
71-day stand at Wounded Knee,
speaking proudly of the Indian’s
success and sadly of their ’failures.
“They held it for 71 days. They
lost two of their number to riﬂe
ﬁre, many were wounded, many
suffered from malnutrition, but
they hung on.”

Wounded Knee was important,
Kunstler claimed, because “out of
it grew an awareness of the plight
of the native Americans.”

Before catching a plane to return _

to Buffalo where he and had an 11
pm meeting to discuss the next
day’s Attica trial strategy, Kunstler
asked for questions.

A member of the audience
questioned Kunstler’s statements
on violence and disruption, and
asked his reaction to‘ the Palestin-
ian Liberation Organization’s ter-
rorist activities.

“l’m Jewish and I’m speaking out
for the PLO,” Kunstler answered.
He termed the PLO’s activities a
“rightful struggle.” But Kunstler
quickly pointed out the terrorists
tactics employed by the Palestin-
inan organization were a last

Even though Pennsylvania State Senator Frank Mazzei. who

-acted improperly and taken advantage of his position to commit serious
 ofﬁnancial gain. Simply as a matter of principle Mazzei should
sign both his senate and Board of Trustees seats. Both are
espectable and pre 'gious positions, and should be ﬁlled by a man
whose reputation is yond doubt. Both positions should be ﬁlled by a
 capable of being trusted. Mazzei’s conviction indicates he can
éneither be trusted nor respected, and should be recognized for what he

Furthermore, it is possible Mazzei’s appeal process could drag on

 both should be considered admirable and respectable.
Unfortmrately, Mazzei’s behavior has only enhanced the image of
politicsas acrooked profession and the image of our democratic system
 corrupt and deceitful.

Every politician connected even remotely with promoting this
 image must be removed from the political scene. Now is the
time for Frank Mazzei to live up to the ideals of the American system at
ast/and resign his positions in the Senate and the Board of Trustees.

  Limit for Abortion

The bitter controversy caused by the eighth month abortion
performed last spring at West Penn Hospital clearly points to the
drastic need for some sort of abortions regulation in Pennsylvania.

this aspect of abortion regulation is of paramount importance.

One more (tlterntttive

To the Editor:

Should students enrolled in
ROTC courses receive academic
credit ‘for their work? Several
readers seem to agree that it
depends on the nature and content
of ROTC courses. If ROTC is alien
to the goals and values of the
University it deserves no academic
recognition. If ROTC courses offer
only the “lower learning” of
military training, the intellectual
integrity of the University is to that
extent undermined, and these
courses deserve no credit. These
are serious objections and reflect
honest concern. 1 suggest, how-

‘ever, that the concern is mis-

directed, that the goals of the’

University and the cause of intel-
lectual integrity would be well
served by granting students their
credit for ROTC.

The concept of a liberal education
is properly the guiding ideal of the
University: to maximize the poten-
tial of each student, to provide him
with a firm understanding of the
values central to Western Civiliza-
tion, to enable all students to freely
choose their life-styles, and to
prepare them to competently pur-
sue their choice. Those students
who are attracted to public service,
whether civil or military, share with
all others the right and need for
this liberal education; they should
not be penalized for the life-style
they choose. ROTC does not count-
er the liberal education ideal, but
rather supports it by providing one
more alternative open to the free
choice of the liberally-educated
student. The quality of the educa-
tion remains unchanged.

There is another aspect of the
University's goal that is sometimes
overlooked. The right to help

Tenure_ Myth
And Research

Dear Sir:

/Your excellent summary of the
Senate debate on tenure put my
remarks a little wrong. The pas-
sage in question more nearly said‘
that ,"A discussion of tenure is
injured if the myth that candidates
are judged merely by counting
publications remains in the back-
ground." Serious judgements are
at issue, and a candidate's work is
ordinarily studied with great care.

educate humane, liberal graduates
carries with it the social responsi-
bility to help create a more humane
society. This can only be done by
encouraging those graduates to
exert their influence in all parts of
our society. This includes the
military; the alternative to an
educated, humane officer corps is
an ignorant, brutal one. ROTC is
designed to support the former
alternative by providing a channel
for liberally-educated people to
enter the corps. Thus ROTC fully
supports the liberal-education ideal
of the University both by helping
maximize student freedom of
choice and by serving as a means
for the carrying out of part of the
University's social responsibility.

But what of the content of the

‘ROTC program? Mindless obe-

dience and efficient violence are
not subjects fit for college cam-
puses. ROTC teaches neither. Un-
thinking robots make poor officers,
while a passion for violence is far
too dangerous to encourage in the"
nuclear age. The officer’s job is to
control, to manage, to assume
responsibility. This is what ROTC
teaches. - ‘

The intellectual integrity of the
University would be compromised
if the military could use academic
cover to propagate its own point of
view; the curriculum is rightly the
concern of the faculty. in the Air
Force ROTC program broad course
goals are laid out for each course,
and meeting these goals is the only
requirement imposed on the in-
structor. For example, the Aero-

space 300 handbook state (caps and’

all) : “THE ACCOMPLISHMENT
OF THE COURSE GOALS IS THE
SINGLE MANDATORY FEATURE
OF AS300." These are the goals:

to the

suggestion that the relative weight
of teaching and scholarship was
being debated, as if the aim were to
develop a mathematical formula for
the ideal professor. We are discus-
sing a personality, someone who is
scholarly and teaches. Such a
person must be considered as a
whole, not as an assortment of
component parts. '
Professor Bart's witty remarks,
which you overlooked, suggested
that the clarity, organization and

good taste of a person's teaching‘

might to some extent be considered
by looking for these qualitites in his
scholarly articles. Anecdotes from
the classroom are not as trust-

Ito experience depression and doubts about giving birth. This condition «

Each student should:

the professional officer in a demo-
cratic society.

2. Understand the socialization
processes, prevailing public atti-
tudes, and value orientations as-
sociated with professional military
service. ' '

Any one of these goals could
easily fit into courses taught in

ty. They are unique only by being
combined into a course specifically
directed at the education of an
officer.‘ There is no branch of

All this is rather off the question
of how to improve teaching. Those
who feel there are serious deficien-
cies in the teaching might well use
their; energies to draw up a
documented record of cases, on_ the
basis of which we could discuss
causes and cures. Mere repetition
of the statement that teaching
matters very much can't improve
anything. The discussions by Dean
Marshall seem to assume our
teaching is so deficient that we
should seek special faculty to be
leaching experts. This seems more
like a. blanket condemnation’ of the
entire present faculty than part of a
program for improvements.

more modest view is that instit-

Money for a

Christmas Party

lo the Editor,

1 noticed in the Pitt News marquee
that a Christmas party is being
sponsored for the children of the
Pitt faculty, staff and alumni. It
seems a damn shame that money is
being spent on these children who
obviously Will have an enjoyable
holiday season anyway. Why not
contribute the idea and the money
to the uiiderpriviledged children in
the area and try to give them a nice
Liiristinas?

1 went to the Bradford regional
campus of Pitt for the last two
years. Almost every student there
sponsored a needy child for our
annual Christmas party” in the
student union. Believe me, the joy
on the little kids faces in Bradford

when they received some small gift —

lrom Santa Clause was much more
appreciated than 1 would think this
“Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy
Christmas Party” would be.

l'm not saying these kids should
not have a Christmas party but why
don't they bring a friend from the
"other side" of town to the party
and really have a good time!

On ROTC

To the Editor:

What opinion do the majority of
students have of the military?
Judging from sentiment expressed
in the Pitt News (11/20/74), it is
certainly a misinformed one.

The charge has been made that
Pitt ROTC cadets are paid. I’ve
been in the program a year and
half, and during this time, not a
penny of aid has been extended to“
me; uniforms and textbooks have
come out of my own pocket.
Scholarships are given based on
merit, and are competitive.

ROTC courses are not leadership
training or drilling, nor.do they
involve obedience-.to‘ “orders” of
any kind; they are merely history
courses identical in concept and
material to history courses given at
Pitt. _

ROTC cadets do not major in
Efficient Killing or Strict Obed-
ience--our military force would be
an ineffective one indeed if this
were so. Officers are encouraged
not only to obtain the baccalaureate
in their academic major, but also to
earn the Master’s and PhD de-
grees. The Army hasn’t room for
the martinet.

Logically, it is unreasonable that a

‘courses by CAS.

cadet majoring in a highly technical
field should be overburdened due
to the non-credit given ' ROTC
Rather, The
College should welcome the oppor-
tunity to bring ROTC under its
humanistic atmosphere. Would it
better serve this country to recruit
its officers only from the somewhat
more isolated military academies?
One should not forget that in this
democracy civilians run the Army,
Navy, and Air‘ Force. Conse-
quently, there should be civilian
input into the Reserve programs.
To interpret war as ‘ritualistic’
demonstrates incredible A naivete--
as any student of sociology or
history will attest, the complexity

of armed conflict precludes any,

simple answer. It is sheer fantasy
to expect other, truly militaristic
nations to demobilize by our exam-
ple, no matter how noble our
aspirations. The military’s mission
is to secure, and if need be, defend
the nation’s interests. David
Heckert struck at the heart of the
matter when he realized that one
“cannot realistically recommend
the abolishment of Army and Air
Force ROTC.”

Let us not penalize cadets for the
misguided idealism of a minority.
Rather, restore to the ROTC cadet
credit,_ and discontinue the exercise
in self—righteousness.

them to attend classes during the
day." “It just makes better’sense
to use your facilities as much as
possible."

General Studies is funded like the
other colleges in the university.
Allocations are provided by the
Provost to pay faculty, and the
tuition goes into a general pool.
Gow explained that while he is told
none'of'the colleges are proﬁtable,
GS is perhaps the least unproﬁt-
able because non-credit courses are
self supporting. If they don’t,pay
for themselves,--they're dropped.

Most GS students have received
credits from other schools and
often many of them transfer from
Pitt to other schools. About 10% of
the students are full time students
from CAS.

The most popular fields, says
Gow, are the career-related ones,
although most of the courses
offered are the arts and sciences
since they are needed to obtain
degrees in all fields.

Debate frequently rages over the
relative academic quality of
General Studies courses, with
many CAS students refusing to
sign for night classes. According to
Dean Gow, however, the academic

‘ quality of GS should be equivalent

to CAS primarily because faculty
and courses are the same.

The consensus among GS stu-
dents and faculty is split. An
anonymous female student who
attended Carnegie-Mellon full time
until her money ran out, agreed;
but, computer science teacher Joy
Simon finds she has “To go over
things a little more at night
because the students seem tired.”

“The students are anxious to
learn,” though Simon claims, and
teaching at night is rewarding. Dr.
George Lukic, himself a G5 grad-
uate, also likes teaching at night,
enjoying the GS mixture.

Not all GS ‘students are working
toward degrees. Some professional

in

fields like education require con-
tinuing education courses offered
at Pitt at night. Elderly citizens
under the “College for the over
sixty" take courses without credit
at drastically reduced rates, if
spaces are available.

Pitt’s External Studies Program,
“The Uncollege” is one of General
Studies’ innovations to reach as
many people as possible. The
student receives packaged learning
material designed for independent
study, including.alternative means
of reaching the intended goal.
Deadlines for self scoring exams
are set to insure that the student
moves along at an adequate rate,
and three classes are scheduled
Saturday mornings. To receive

 than 50% of all college students are enrolled in umversitr

 Night Students Focus on Pitt’s General

Henry Fonzi of Forest Hills went
to Allegheny Community College
full time for a year before he
dropped out. He now works for
Westinghouse, who is sending him
to school to learn engineering. He
finds professors a “little more
lenient“ at night.

“lt’s a little rough working eight
hours and then going to class,
sometimes directly from work,”
admits Fonzi, “but, I could never
put myself through as a full time
day student.” Such is the case
with most other GS students.

Gow says the future looks good for
Pitt's General Studies. “We're the
only part of the university which
has been growing (about 8% a
year) and has plans for additional

across the nation as part-timers. At Pitt, they come to the School of

courses, examinations are re-
quired.

At night, the Cathedral, filled
with G5 students, is an odd mixture
of blue jeans and business suits.
The average‘ age of the students,
according to Gow, is somewhere in
the ‘mid-twenties as compared to
CAS' 20-year-old average.

when on-campus classes aren’t
held in the Cathedral.” In five
years Gow believes about half of
the GS classes will be held off the
Oakland campus.

Finally, Gow sees the present
interest in career related fields
continuing as the job market re-
mains tight for liberal arts grad-
uates.

General Studies students aren't
altogether a disunified group.
According to Gow. their student

Carol Cushman, president of the
year—old GS student government,

A and four council members, popu-

larly elected, direct the govern-
ment in an effort to get GS students
"involved in the mainstream of
university life." Explains Cush-
man, "We had 6,200 students
constituting a large percentage of
the total university population pay-
ing a $4 activities fee and wonder-
ing where it went."

Part-time students don’t receive
nearly as many benefits as the full
time students, states Cushman.

: iﬁﬁhe GS student government is

trying to remedy that situation by
providing tickets to university
sporting events at half price, and
by sponsoring an annual school
banquet, three graduation ban-
quets, and weekly faculty rap
sessions at the student union

pi Film Industry:

 if Booming /Business 

LOS ANGELES (AP) — There’s
no business like show business,
according to the Irving Berlin
anthem, and that may help explain
why the movie industry is thriving

_ while the rest of the nation's

??'¥r‘economy is in the doldrums.

V T It happened before. During the

\ great Depression, when stock
brokers were selling apples on
street corners, the movie business
boomed. Ninety 'million \tickets
were sold at theaters each_week.

Today, with Ford "administration

'leaders admitting that the ‘country
is in the midst of a recession, the
film industry appears to be doing
gﬁtter than any time since the
 postwar peak in 1946. ‘T Daily
Variety reports that theater re-
ceipts in October marked the 11th
straight monthly rise." The paper
observed that 1974 could bring in
$1.6- billion to the nation’s box
offices, almost matching 1946’s
record $l.692.billion. .

Signs of the industry’s health can
be seen in the financial reports of
the major companies:

MCA reported anine-month proﬁt
of $40 million, higher than the
company’s total for last year.-
MCA’s Universal Pictures, with
such winners as The Sting and

American Graffiti, enjoyed rentals
T’ of $159 million, up 172 per cent.

‘Warner Brothers claimed ‘a
world’s record for film rentals for a
nine-month total of $221 million,
due in large part to The Exorcist.

Walt Disney Productions set
records in sales and proﬁts for the
seventh straight year, the profit.
.listed at $48 million. The film
division rose 21 per cent to a gross
of $103 million.

Most of the other companies have
showed gainsz, even the long-ailing
MGM has displayed new life with
its sensational That’s Entertain-

‘Slower ballads like “I Cannot

The Heart of Saturday Night, Tom

' Waits, Asylum .-.(7E.-1015)

Tom Waits drives an’ old
Thunderbird that gets about six
miles to the gallon, drinks beer,
smokes a lot of raunchy cigarrettes,
has Kerouac as his favorite poet
and plays piano without any
stylistic technique at all...and he’s
good.

His second album‘(Closing Time A

on Asylum was debut) is a marked

~ improvement over his other. This‘
album is primarily a piano oriented »

one with the back-up coming from
upright and drums givingit a feel
of the clubs in downtown Chicago
or the ‘sleezy bars of Pittsburgh
with the smoke ﬁlling all the
corners where legs rub together..I
the person across from you
deciding whether they're gonna
pick you up or be picked up.._.
Tom Waits could emerge as the
finest rock poet since Jim Morrison
or Joni- Mitchell. Take away the
music and a muscular skeleton of
words is left to support the
remaining aura of Waits’ ,talent._
“Diamonds On My Windshield" is

1.
a piece with drums and brushes-

and bass_ and Tom reciting a
poem...the cogent force of lyrical
dynamosity with the atmosphere of.
driving paranoia is demonstrated
on this the finest piece‘ on the
elpee. ‘ '

Tom Waits will be here on
Sunday. For a real show before or’
after ﬁnals, come down to Common
Facilities and catch this poet at the
piano...The Heart of Saturday

REFUGEES, by Rachel Faro RCA
(CPLI-0689)

Not only will this woman’s talent
be overlooked, but self-righteous
criticism and subjectivity will miss
the backing support .she receives.

It seems to me that you couldn't

make a bad album with people like
John Simon, Dave Holland, Jack
deJohnette, Harvejg Brooks, Mike
Brecker, Howard‘ Johnson, Randy
Brecker and Collin Walcott (plus
more) and furthermore you
couldn't listen to an album with
these people on it and forget about
_the talent that would seep out of
it...unless these names were
unfamiliar to you and then the
review would have to be on a purely
musical-sociological plane.

Adding the talents of these jazz
masters, many who have worked
with Miles...Rachel Faro, with the
strong and varied range of her
vocals, presents a debut l.p. that
has the strength to match a Lauro
Nyro or Bonnie Raitt...the lyrical
melodic and titilising strength of a
soulful reproach.

The title cut seems to sum up the

feelings of most of this genera- -

tion’s frustrations...the death .and
despair, cheating and ‘lying,
stirring andbackbiting of a ﬁlthy
administration that has caused us
to turn deeper into ourselves and
become refugees.

Not only is her voice overpower- |.

ing, and lyrical quality serene to
moving but ,the dulcimer , and

rhythm guitar she plays is.a cherry ‘

on top of the sundae. She wouldn't

have had to add the instruments on-

the overdubbing ‘because of the
strong and imm_ensely_ rich and
vigourus vocalising displayed.

BY KEN MINARIK

Two‘ new albums by female
rockers have recently been releas-

ed——and this reviewer hopes that

these dogs be "captured and
chained immediately. The albums,
One More Hour by Gale McCor-
mick and Refugees by Rachel Caro,
afe once again futile attempts at
breaking radio playlists with no
material but just a pretty face.
They are far from the first to try to
do so. ._
One of the absolute failures of the
women’s liberation movement has
been its inabiiity in finfiltrate an
almost exclusively male domain-
the top 40. With the exception of
an_ occasional Carpenters or Carly
Simon success, Billboard’s elusive
number one spot has been almost
exclusively male dominiated.
At first, one might damn this fact
as merely another result of our
, male-dominated society, and resort
.. to “male ‘chauviniist pig” name
calling. _But wait a minute,
folks...it’s not all our fault. Oink
Oink. ‘

The main reason for the failure of _

female. rock is simple: most top-40
material offered by the “fairer
sex”,has absolutely stunkitself off
the charts. _ ~ '

The “number one’_’ female rock
group today is Fanny, who will go
down in history as the only rock_

group that was pretentiousenough ‘

to try to peddle their debut album
by flaunting their asses on the
cover. Unfortunately for their
careers, .that was about the ‘only
thing about the album that the
critics noticed. 1

This critic hears a lot. of
derogatory comments about Bach-
man Turner Overdrive, but one
must admit that they have yet to try
to sell an album by putting their
buns on the cover.
‘_ Most everyone in the Pittsburgh
area knows of Fanny's closest

“Don't take notes," Helen told

performance in Stephen Foster and
' we stood outside the auditorium

came to see her point. Because the
A Iowa Theatre Lab’s Dancer With-
out Arms burrowed beneath con-
scious thought processes, such as
. note taking, to dig up feelings. Not
-. having notes produced an inter-
esting effect on this article. A lot of
~ fascinating things got said by
gestures during the show, by words
after the show. But I don’t have
. any recording of them. So I’m left

DRAFTS  

/what the Lab intended.

By making so few concessions to
traditional audience expectations
and by the purposefulness and
self-knowledge with which they
infused their performance, the Lab
spurred me on to a greater com-
prehension of myself.

It wasn't like Isaac Newton get-
ting hit on the head with the apple
but I definitely perceived and thus

began to comprehend some feel-

ings and attitudes of mine because

of the production and conversations .

with the company. Talking to the
Lab members is just like watching
their show...wh'ile they're convey-
ing their own emotions they're
constantly trying (and succeeding)
to draw yours out. If I asked them a
question, they were interested in

_ why lasked it. And the questions I

asked were indeed revealing once
they were challenged.

I was, forced to realize that I still
had kept some preconceptions, that
I was still trying to fall back on the
form of a more traditional article as
I inquired about the background of
the production and the company.
And similarly people might be put
off by the skimpiness of the part of
this article devoted to the show.
But the Lab had their reasons, good
ones. The show as a whole was
valid because it connected with
audience feelings; it needed no
verbal explanations afterward. In
an articlepa greater reality can be
achieved by concentration of reac-
tions to the work instead of analysis
of it.

We were led through a black
tunnel into a small confined area,
the props and the cloth walls
mostly black. Seated on benches,
we were so close to the actors that
the show's emphasis on the senses
was greatly heightened. One
member of the audience said he
could even smell the perspiration of
the actors.

Dissonant voices and tinkling
bells; eerie sounds that weren't
half as striking as the sound of a
wooden comb being pulled through
long hair. Or, the sound of a finger
rubbed against the rim of a metal
bowl. ,

Dancer .Without Arms by passed
my brain and went right to my
senses. Sounds. Gibberish, howls,
groans, and laughs that fir/red
feelings so much more accurately
than words. By rejecting words the
Lab is rejecting traditional, artifi-
cial theatre, plays build on dia-
logue. Words are imprecise,
products of «thought...and the Lab’s

play is precise, changing little in‘

form night to night. lt’s almost like
a ritual...cIoser to religious cele-
brations than conventional plays.
buddcn bursts of violent, liber-
ated movement, stalkiiig...juniping
...stomping...running...caressing..
Repression and liberation and frus-
tration. Sensuality and sexuality.

lliosc are some of the things the -

show spoke to me about. Bodies
expressing feelings not thoughts.
Wild jumping would be performed
on a confined platform. An actor
screams with a bandanna stuffed in
his mouth.

Conversing with the Lab’s a lot
like watching their show. The
imprecision of words surfaces as
George, an actor, contrasts his
positive connotation of the word
theatrical with my negative one.
The precision of the show eman-
ates from , ‘the company's self-
knowledge. Their lives have
direction, it seems, and they can
use this understanding to pull out
gestures that give larger-tlian-life
representations of their personality
with more authori,ty. than their
words. lhe inquisitive way they
prowled the house where the party
was held, touching the beautiful
woodwork a reflection of how
highly they value their senses.
When people left, the actors said
goodbye, more with movements
than with words. Sight: the
intensity with which they watched a
tortured dying iguana.

"bod!" Rick Zank whispered
responding to the beauty of a litter
of sleeping kittens. Rick’s the
director of the Lab. In conversa-

tion, the way he perceives t-hings is '

similar to the show's attitude.
"Why were you so nervous during

the show'."' Rick asks me as he
iiiiines my way of fidgeting with my
hands. He sees gestures as
rcpreseiitations of something
deeper...Rick watches how you

move more than he listens to wliat ‘ﬁg.

you say.

At one point Rick and l were
talking to another guy and we were
positioned like the points of a
triangle. Rick can really pick up on
the meanings of subtle gestures...
he noticed that the other guy
moved his head sometimes and I
asked hint if he was deaf in one ear.

When the other guy said he was
deal in the car since he was five, I
could see that Rick was more

Kinks Concert in Review

5
yu

BY HARRY S. ERB
At one time I considered Ray
Davies a genius. Today I think of
him and his Kinks as the second
best rock and roll band (remember
the Beatles?) ever to arise from the
land where the sun never sets.’ But
where is the genius who gave us
such delights as “Waterloo Sun-
set," “Sunny Afternoon," “After
the Season” and “Shangri-la?"
Where is the orignial, biting guitar
of_Dave Davies? Where is‘Lola?
Watching the Kinks last Monday
night at the Stanley ‘Theater was
like watching Robert Altman or
Orson Welles directing a John
Wayne, hero wins all in the end,
movie.
outside in a sharp, freezing wind
for over an hour, we finally reached
our seats only tg wait another hour
for the concert to begin. Needless
to say, it was quite boring.
The Davies brothers opened the
first, and finest, of their two sets
with a disappointing, hacked-up
version of “Victoria,” thenopening
song of their greatest album,
Arthur. The remainder of the set
was performed in typical Kinks
fashion: Ray singing and dancing,
throwing beer on everybody and
frequently missing both verses and
lines; Dave playing exquisite lead
_guitar, leaning away from the
microphone during background
vocals, making his falsetto barely
audible; the rest of the band playig

as if they were asleep, watching .

Ray make an ass of himself. It was
great.

Some of the songs they played
were “You Really Got Me”

The Sleeping Wonder

BY M.C. PILECKI
There's a four-letter word to
describe Law and Disorder: dull.
L&D has a lot going for it tomake
it as boring as possible. It starts
from the tired, cliched premise of
the old “New York (or any big city)
is a jungle." It used to get a big
laugh on the insomniac late-night

talk show when some grizzled

comedian would tell stories of
being mugged threetimes in the
same block—while he was still in
his apartment.

Those jokes had whiskers ‘way
back then, and were just propa-
ganda for the suburban types who
had to make some sort of excuse for
moving out to the boondocks:
“sure, the city is hell to live in,
that’s why we moved out here.”
Right.

‘sophomores, and only one senior,

 and when you take such a young

‘team into intercollegiate competi-

Learning the required routines is
something that can't be done in
weeks or months. but rather years.
The team was faced with the same
type of problem last year. Perez’s

point-wise that any Pitt team had

I and only one senior. and it is very

difficult with such a young team.

‘I _ gWe have a good idea of what our

opponents will have, because
gymnastics is a very precise sport.
You know what a guy will get based
on his past performances."

In the all-around competition,
Perez will use freshman Pete
Porzuczek, and sophomores Bob
Pasterick, Don Stevens, and Gus
Papantonio. Pasterick and senior
Mark Boyett give Perez some depth

~ on the floor exercise. On the high

bar, Pasterick and freshman Frank
Klien will provide the punch for the
Panthers.

Sophomore Jim Kolesar will
perform on the rings and the
parallel bars, and his experience
from last year should help him in
the two events. The Panthers will

Abe especially weak on the side-
horse. Sophomore Mike Petroski is

the main man on the sidehorse,
but depth will be a problem.

Freshman Tim Rand will do the
vaulting, and will also help out on
the parallel bars and the high bar,
when needed.

Perez does indeed have his
problem as he tries to pull the
Panthers from the gutter of
collegiate gymnastics; Before
Perez came to Pitt, the Cats had
maintained a dismal 3-77 record,
and about the only thing you can
say about that record is that it was
consistent.

Besides, like all minor sports at_

Pitt, Perez has less money to
operate with than the amount of
snow Floridians can build snowmen
with. And yes, Pitt is the only team
in the Eastern Intercollegiate
Gymnastics league that doesn't
have any assistant coaches.
Despite all the adversities, Perez
is looking forward to the future,

To Slugger

NEW ORLEANS AP--The Atlanta
Braves acquired controversial

slugger Dick Allen from the
Chicago White Sox in a deal
completed today at baseball's

winter meetings.

The Braves sent cash and a player
to be named later to the White
Sox-contingent upon Allen's end-
ing his announced retirement and
reporting to Atlanta for the 1975
season.

Allen left the White Sox last
September, saying he was finished
with baseball. But last month he
appeared to open the way for his
return to the game, saying he had
never officially announced his
retirement.

Allen led the American League
with 32 home runs last season and
batted .301 with 88 runsbatted in
128 games. _ *

Dick Allen

The 32-year-old Allen» compiled a
.563 slugging average, tops in the
American League, in his third
season with the White Sox.

If he reports, Atlanta will be the
fifth major league stop for Allen
one of the game’s top sluggers.

He came up to the majors to stay
as aithird baseman with Philadel-
phiai in 1964 and spent six stormy
seasons with the Phillies before
being traded to St. Louis in 1969.
He played one season for the
Cardinals and another with the Lost
Angeles Dodgers before being
swapped to the White Sox in 1971.
_‘ He has never hit less than .279
and has a ‘major league career
average of .300. _

he hit just one of four free throw
attempts.

The Panthers had an opportun-
ity to blow the game wide open in
the opening frame but some cold
shooting. particularly from the‘
foul line where they made just
three of nine attempts. and some-
shoddy ball-handling kept the
Mounties close. The Mountain-
eers also managed to out rebound
the Panthers in the first half by a
27-23 edge as Baker pulled down
ten to dominate play under the
boards.

The Panthers looked as though
they were going to wrap up the

‘game early in the second half. Af-

within striking range. He contin-
ued "to dominate the offensive
boards while hitting on several

Virginia 21 61-60 lead with 8:38"

left in the game.

Pitt wasn’t behind for long,
however, as they quickly regain.-
ed the lead over the surging WVU
squad which was urged on by the
8,962 fans who packed the Colli-
sium and at times got a little un-
ruly. Baker continued his out-
standing display but Bruce Hill,
Richards, and Starr played jtist
well enough to keep Pitt on top.

With 3:41 left to play. Pitt held
the ball after a basket by Bob
Huggins who scored 13 points on
the night. The Panthers attempted
to run down the clock. freezing
the ball for over two minutes.
Baker then fouled Starr who hit
the first end of the one-and-one to
set the score at 72-68_.

WVU came right back when
Huggins added another two point-
er to bring his team within one
basket. After a costly turnover by
the Panthers. Boskovich knotted
the score with a beautiful left
handed hook off of a Jerome An-
derson feed. ‘

With 52 seconds left, the Pan-L

thers went for the final shot sit-
ting on the ball and calling time-
out with just six seconds left. The
ball was thrown in and Hill found
himself alone on the right side
of the basket. He dribbled in sev-
eral feet for the short jumper but
the ball hit the back.of the rim

 NFL

Except AFC East

BY BRUCE LOWITT
AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK AP-- Despite still
another wave of weekend upsets,
the National Football League
playoff picture is now in better
focus-leaving only the American
Conference East far from decided.

Three more teams-Houston, Den-
ver and Green Bay-were mathema-
tically eliminated from the playoffs
last weekend. With three titles
officially wrapped up, nine teams

-«,/":3-*3‘-till are in the running for the five
remaining berths, including St.
Louis and Buffalo which will at
least make the playoffs in the
wild-card draw. However, some of
the contenders such as Detroit and
New England, have only the
"slimmest of hopes, needing mira-
cles as well as victories to stay
alive.

Minnesota, combining its victory
Sunday over New Orleans with
Green Bay's loss to Philadelphia,
clinched the National Conference
Central title, joining the Los
Angeles Rams in the West as
divisional winners.

And St. Louis, even though it lost
to Kansas City on Sunday,
remained a game ahead of
runner-up Washington in the NFC
East. thanks to Dallas, which beat
the Redskins on Thanksgiving Day.

The Cardinals need only one more
victory to sew up the East title-and
they play a pair of losing teams the
last two weeks, New Orleans next
Sunday and the New York Giants
on Dec. 15.

Similarly, the Redskins need only
one more victory to clinch the
NFC’s “wild-card” playoff berth as
the team with the best runner-up

record. They play the tough Rams
next Sunday but close the season
against the Chicago Bears.

So it would appear, barring a total
collapse by,St. Louis and Washing-
ton, that these two teams will wind
up 1-2 in the East and both will be
playoff-bound.

And assuming that St. Louis wins
the division and Washington
finishes second, the NFC playoffs
will begin with the Cards at
Minnesota on Saturday, Dec. 21
and the wild-card Redskins at Los
Angeles on Sunday, Dec. 22.

Dallas and Detroit still can make it
as wild-card teams, but the
Cowboys must beat Cleveland and
Oakland and hope that Washington
drops its two games. Detroit not
only has to beat both Cincinnati
and Philadelphia but must hope
that both Washington and Dallas

chance to do what no other player
has ever done - win the Heisman
twice.

lll becoming the 38th offensive
back to win the award, Griffin
completed a sensational string of
pertoimances that dates back to the
opening game of the 1973 season,

voting.

"l’ve never had a player like

Arch," said Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes. “'He’s remarkable
not only because he is the best
runner we have ever had, but also
because of the way he blocks and
his over-all ability as an athlete. If
ever anyone was deserving of the
Heisman Trophy it is Archie Grif-
fin.”

V In the 1974 season, Griffin, who
already is the all-time Ohio State
and Big Ten leading rusher, was
the key to the Buckeye attack,
carrying 230 times for 1,020 yards,
an average of 147.3 yards a game
as Ohio State posted a 10-1 record.

He scored 12 touchdowns. Griffin
will appear in his third consecutive
Rose Bowl game on New Year’s
Day against Southern California.
Griffin's leading competition for
the 1-leisman Trophy was another
outstanding tailback, senior An-
thony Davis of Southern California,
who rushed for 1,354 yards and

‘scored four times against Notre

Dame last Saturday after most
Heisman votes were cast.

Michigan Meet Cancelled

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

At about two o'clock Sunday
afternoon the Pitt wrestling- team
boarded its bus for a trip to Ann
Arbor, scheduled to meet Michi-

gan's niatmeii Monday night.
And, at about two o’clock Tuesday

' afternoon, they returned. With no

decision.

"it's usually a six-hour drive,"
said coach Dave Adams, “so we
should have been there by eight
o'clock Sunday night. We finally
got in at about eight on Monday

Swimmers

  Aiiiihilate
Temple

BY TOMHALL
The University of Pittsburgh
Varsity Swimming and Diving
Team opened an encouraging
1974-75 season with a 98-15 win
over the Temple Owls. The lop-

?‘<o;sided victory was, however,'little

‘indication of the abilities of either
team. - -

“We did a lot of experimenting
for this meet, and just let the final
score go where it would,” Coach
Dick Bradshaw said. “Temple is in
a rebuilding stage this year, under
a new head coach. Our basic
objective was to give many of our
younger team members some valu-

Enable meet experience in prepara-
,_, "*f'i‘on for the Penn State Relays

coming up this weekend. Some of
our regular swimmers were absent
with illnesses or injuries, which
gave us the opportunity to give
some of the others a chance to
compete.”

Of the thirteen events, Pitt took
every first place, and all but two
seconds. "I'm quite pleased with
the progress we've made so early
in the season. At this point last
year we were not quite this far
along."

At the Temple meet, stellar
performances were turned in by

§’__‘Jei'1'y DeMuro, and freshman Dave

Civis. DeMuro set a team record
for the 500 yard freestyle with a’
time of 4.51.1, while Civis swam

the 50 yard freestyle in an impres- A

sive 22.7 seconds.

Last year’s MVP John Schegpner
won two races, as did Carlos
Santiago. Equally impressive is the
fact that Pitt swimmers ﬁnished
first and second in both the 400
yard Medley Relay, and in the 400
yard Freestyle Relay.

hi the diving events, Jeff Miller
won the One-Meter diving, with
Tom Faytol finishing second. Pitt

had planned to stay in.

"We didn’t find a place to stay
until about noon,” Adams said,
“and then we found out the match
was cancelled. A lot of people
didn’t make it.”

So, Pitt's first dual meet of the
season will be this Saturday against
leniple in the afternoon at the
l-'ield House. The only action the
team has seen was the fifth annual

Belles Tournament at Millersville,

Pa. November 22-23. Pitt placed
first of the 31 schools competing

with 115 points, 10 more than host

Millersville State, the runnerup.
Panthers placed among the top four
in eight of 10 weight classes, with
Skip Bolin (150) and John Chatman
(lo7) placing first.

"We did expect to win," Adams
said. "We set that as a goal for
ourselves. The guys reacted real
well to the pressure, and came out
like good, aggressive wrestlers. l’d
say we were the best-conditioned
team at the tournament, and our
takedown skills were about the best
also."

The team’s future has been
darkened by injuries, however.
George Bryant [I26], who placed
fifth in the NCAA as an All-
America last year after an unde-
feated record in dual meets, is out
with a pulled rib cartilage. Bill
Korth [142] will be out 8-10 weeks
with a hyperextended el_bgw_,< and

-.,-.Wrestlers °°Si1owed” Under

Jeff Minerd [190] has torn ankle
ligaments. All three will be gone
until after Christmas.

Adams is pleased with his out-
standing crop of freshmen, specifi-
cally starters Kevin Nellis (118),
Bill Bailey (I77) and Bolin. Other
starters include Rande Stottlymyer
(I34), Ray Dallatore (158) and Carl
Roba (l-lwt.).

"We have the capability of a
decent season," Adams said, "or
at least a better one than last

‘season. lt'll depend on our young

wrestlers, and, of course, on injur-
ies. I'm very pleased with the
team's attitude and enthusiasm.
lzveryone works hard, and they're
a real good group to work with.
"We'll know a lot more after this
lemple match Saturday. Student

support always helps a lot, and
we‘d all like to see a good
turnout."

“Disorder”: One Big Sleeper 

(Continued from Page 11)

force needed to protect their wives
and daughters. All they need are
the ten-gallon hats and horses.
These middle-aged guys get a big
kick out of the uniforms and routine
and exercising the authority which,
without the uniforms and the
routine, etc., they’d be too
spineless to try to exercise.
There's no particular plot, and the
movie is really too uneven to decide
whether it’s supposed to be A) light
drama, B) satire, or C) farce. In
this case, it’s D) none of the above.
The movie has a “surprise tragic
ending” that really doesn’t fit in
with the story. If Law and
Disorder is supposed to be a
serious look at the problem and
dangers of vigilantism, then the
ending makes no sense. It’s just

another throwback to the “the city»

is hell” theme, or, more specific-
ally in this case, “whitey better
watch out.”

Roaming around the center of this
muck is the story of two friends,
Cy, a disgruntled beauty salon
proprietor (Ernest Borgnine) who
get his kicks hunting and collecting

guns, and Willie (Carroll O’Con- ‘

nor), a cab driver always dreaming
of making it big. Sadly, the two
characters are very well created by
excellent actors, and it’s shame to
see them wasted on such a terrible
script.

For fans who have gotten tired of
O’Connor’s bigoted,

here’s a chance to see him do
bigger and better things. His

A Willie (more than just slightly

one-dimen-'
' sional Archie Bunker character,

suggestive of the salesman“ Willie
Loman) is a middle-aged man
grown past his dreams, but still
dreaming. He constantly seeks
schemes to abandon his cab and go
into business with his wife of Cy,
probably as much to seek a closer
relationship with these people as
for the promise of wealth.

But for all his fantasies, Willie is
probably the most “real” character
of the film.
auxiliary force as grown men
playing cops and robbers, and get
sucked in just to please his friends.
He tries to maintain a parental
relationship (including some mea-
sure of control) with his teenaged
daughter, and finds that he has
little authority in governing his own
life, let alone that of his wife and
child.

That is reading a lot into the part

of Willie as written, but as

He pooh-poohs the-

portrayed by O’Connor, the sensi-
tive cab driver becomes a portrait
of Middle America. Too bad it was
ﬂushed down the toilet of such a

Borgnine hams up hisprole and,
