Editorial: Telegraph Harrisburg Now

Our University is caught in a maze of petty politics and finance. A
contribution of a little more than a dollar and a few minutes of your time

NOW is the answer.

The University is facing unbelievable problems because the State
Legislature has failed to pass the appropriations bill financing a new state-
related status. University billing, housing, admissions, scholarship and
loans cannot be completed until the Legislature acts. The major Univers-
ity operations have literallycome to halt because of this delay.

Students do not know whether they will have to pay $1,400 or $450.
Many with limited resources will be caught in a needless financial bind.
They want to come‘ to the University but they are not sure they can afford
it. The Legislature cannot legally act on Pitt legislation until they have
passed the General Appropriations Bill, now stalled by«bitter fighting

between Democrats and Republicans.

New Housing Head
Searches Oakland

For . Student’s Home

By DAN BOOKER ,

Those University students who will be pounding the '
pavement in search of an apartment for the fall trimester
may find succor in the office of Louis K. McLinden, newly
appointed co-ordinator of off-campus housing. -

McLinden has drawn up a list of available ‘housing in
the Pittsburgh area and is making it available to members
of the University community. The list, revised every three
weeks, ranges from apartments at $35 a month to furnished

houses at $250 a month. ~

In his endeavor to make sure there will be enough housing off-
campus, the new co-ordinator has even issued a plea to notify his
office/if a commuter has an extra room to rent.

The most critical shortage of off-campus shelter exists for mar-
ried students with children. Very few landlords want children of
any age in their buildings, explained McLinden. There" are also short-
ages of rooms for women students and for married students without
children. The lack of rooms for women students exists despite the
fact that only women with 60 or more credits are allowed to live

out ‘of University dormitories.

The post of co-ordinator of off-
campus housing was established

- when, because of the expected"

state-relatedness, officials thought
that dormitory room would not
accommodate all the students
wanting rooms. They estimated
that several hundred additional
rooms would be needed.

However, there are_ more rooms
in the residence halls than.was
anticipated. Dean of ‘Men Her-
bert McGibbony said that the un-

sure status of state-relatedness

may be the reason some students
have not reserved’ dormitory
rooms for the ' fall. Although
there will be more residence hall
rooms than expected, .the demand
for off-campus housing will still
remain great, according to Me-

' Gibbony. -

A Other reasons for the establish-
ment of the new position were
the desire for a permanent Uni-
versity agency for handling off-
campus residences and the de-
mand‘ by offices such as the 0f-
ﬁce of Cultural and Economic
Exchange thua-t there be suitable

Vvhousing available for students

who come here for special pro-
grams or from foreign countries.

McLinden will not "be “approv-
ing” housing in the sense that
rooms will be inspected and then

The Legislature will recess this Wednesday. There is no time now
for petitions, demonstrations or caravans. Seven thousand will read this

With this sentence, Howard
Ainman, vice-president of Stit-
dent Government (SG), and
Fred Frank, editor-in-chief of The
Pitt News, began ~ a telegram
which was sent to Governor Wil-

liam Scranton last night. This ‘

telegram, along with others to
several legislative officials, is part
of an effort by SG and The Pitt
News to speed up the lagging

‘movement of the state General

Appropriations Bill.

Telegrams were also sent to
the Speaker of the State House
Joshua Eilberg and Rep. Ma-rtin

’ Mull-en, chairman of I the, House

Appropriations Committee.

In the telegrams, Ainisman and
Frank noted that time’ is running
out and that " action should be

taken as quickly as possible. They _

also said that the speed of the
decision on state-relatedness “will

affect the future of students,

their parents, the University, and

I’ Western Pennsylvania.’’ \

“We urge you expedite _ the
passage of the resolutions con-

. cer_nin_g [Pitt's state-re1atédness,”-

University, Penn State Uni-
versity, and the University
of Pennsylvania, remains
uncertain.

The main issue of contention
between the Democratic" House
and the Republican Senate rests
in their conﬂicting General Ap-
propriations bills,-The House, led
by D e m o c r at i c Representative
Martin Mullen of its appropria-
tions committee, insists on more
than 200 speciﬁc appropriation
bi1ls.. Republican Senator Robert
Fleming of the Senate's ﬁnancial
committee champions that body's
single appropriations bill, which
primarily empowers the execu-
tive to administer monies.

To escape this dilemma, both
the House and Senate have sched-
uled__a recess of at least one
week and possibly three. The leg-
islators explain that the recess
will expedite matters by allow-
ing the issue to be aired by a
joint Conference Committee. As

soon as the Conference Commit- .

tee arrives at an amenable appro-
priation bill, the legislators will
be summoned to Harrisburg to»
pass the compromise bill.

The lag in ﬁnances is also felt
by the state itself. The legislators
must resort to a. stopgap appro-
priation to ensure that the state
is able to run after July 1, when
its budget expires. This uncer-

tainty makes it necessary for the

University to compute every.
scholarship, loan and grant ap-
plication at three levels of tui-
tion: 1) The present $1,400 per
3831'; 2) The possible $700 per

Year, and 3) The‘ _more likely '

assumption that 'it will become

state-related before the legis_la- .5

ture ﬁnally recesses.

Acting Chancellor David Kurtz- 
, man noted that the University. 
“has already‘ spent a good deal’ 
on the assumption that theschool ‘

 

will become state-related. For in-
stance, we’re setting up machin-

ery for identifying Pennsylvania 

students. We have authorized the

deans to hire more graduate-‘_’ 
teaching assistants. Frankly. if 

we don't get ‘the increased; an-
rollment from the tuition reduc-_’
tion we will have wasted some
expenditures.” : 

Dr. Kurtzman said that the dif-J.
fulties of the University will cen-
ter around administrative 
ters. “We will have to , spend
more money for overtime pay
when the bill‘ is passed. We'll
have a bulge in activities and
hope that ourmachinery doesn't
break -down with this load.” The
Acting Chancellor's concern was‘
primarily for the students.-“From:
my viewpoint our-difficulties will
be minor compared to those of
the ‘students and their parents,
who will have to make last min-
ute ﬁnancial adjustments.”

Assistant Director of Admis-V
sions Robert I-Iannigan suggested;
that the University may not take,
on many students, despite the‘
tuition reduction which‘ willac-*
company state-relatedness.“ “We
will have many problems. It may.

Student Complains
About Cop Security

Editor, The Pitt News:

Imagine my surprise at walk-
ing into the Student Union build-
ing on Friday, June 3, at 4 o’clock
in the afternoon and ﬁnding a
contingent of security police
there. I knew that the alumni
were having a smorgasbord that
afternoon and evening, but I did
not know that the Student Union
had been declared off limits for
that Friday and the following
day to current students enrolled
in the University.

I explained to the.man in blue
that I just wanted a drink of
water, when he told me that I
was not allowed to step over a
certain line which was not more
than two feet from the water
fountain.

I realize that the school de-
pends on the alumni for ﬁnan-
cial support and that this alum-
ni weekend is a means of get-
tings funds, but why do this at
the expense of current students
who will be the future alurrmi of
the University? The Student
Union, by its very title, is for the
students. The fact that the Union

was used for the alumni should.

be no occasion for using armed
guards to keepcurrent students.
away. Where are these police-
men when they_ are really needed
in cases of theft and prowlers
in the dormitories? It seems the
University must reassess its val-
ue system and decide whether
it is being run for the students‘
currently attending or for the;
alumni and try to‘ compromise
between the two.

‘Stop The World’
Review Criticized
Editor, The Pitt News:

After reading Don De Cesare’s
review of Stop the World ‘—- I
Want to Get Off, I am convinced
that he knows as little about
artistic achievement_as some of’
the New York critics who pan-
ned the live show when it open-
ed. Mr. De Cesare seems to be
the average illiterate critic who
cannot understand anything un-
less it is handed to him in bold,
letters on a silver platter.

Stop the World is a rare kind;

of musical adventure and excite-
ment. Very simply put, it has-
something to say. Through its in-
genous use of dialogue, music,
and most of all pantomine, Stop
the World, makes the moviegoer
think;
few movies do.

Mr. De Cesare seems to ﬁnd
fault in the simple scenery that

is employed. but unfortunately

he. is missing one of the strong
points of the movie. Unless you
can ‘afford to throw a couple of

as simple as possible. In this way
the audience can bring their own,
imagination into play; hence
closing the gap between player
and moviegoer.

I suggest that'Mr. De Cesare

instead of writing while watch-
ing a movie.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Blonde, blue-eyed, guitar-play-

major, joined the Peace Corps in
her junior year. She is a native
of Ogden, Utah, trained at the
University of California at Los
Angeles where she lived. with a
family in Watts and interned in
the Watts public schools.

The following is a letter writ-
ten to a Pitt ‘student after at
month of teaching at the Rural
Training Center at Asaba, Ni-
geria. ,

Hello, hello. Its a lazy Sunday
and the strains of Barbara Streis-
and are ﬂoating from our room.
I am encased in my mosquito
net in the bedroom. My mosquito
bites, by the way, are crowding

my many tropical ills.

I don’t‘know where to begin
to tell /you about this strange
month. Another Peace Corp vol-
unter and I live at the top of a
hill surrounded by jungle and
overlooking the river Niger. Our
trees are ﬁlled with sounds (we
never see them) of wild birds
and animals. _ —

We have 100 varieties of in-
sects from tiny to huge whom
we don’t even bother to exterm-

yes, lizards. But I like the liz-
ards. They don’t ,bother anyone

are studying Hemingway right
now so I have a chance to try
wings as a teacher-lecturer. I am
all of a sudden an “expert” on
everything.

I’ve been a little lonely and
homesick lately. I unfortunately
got a Saturday Evening Post and
opened it right up to a picture
of Glacier Park.

When I ﬁrst got here I had
bacillary dysentary-——it left me
pretty weak and kind of bored
with everything. That sounds

horrible but it just happened.‘

Being so sick in a strange place

I think back home it is possi-
ble to live an automatic exis-
tence and have your time ﬁlled
up with all sorts of nonsense
and busywork. Here I teach
school 15 hours a week and don’t
have a tremendous amount of
preparation——-so I have a lot of
free time. Since a woman isn’t
free here to wander around and
meet people, I spend a lot of’
time reading, writing, picking.

ing and thinking

This month, though, we have
a little excitement planned. We’re-
going to Port Hurcoud, “Little-
America” of Nigeria, where
they have hamburgers and hot-
dogs. Silly of us? Lets face it——-
if you like America you like
these things. I don’t live for these
things like lots of volunteers,
but I enjoy them.

I guess it sounds like I don’t
like Nigeria. I do like it very
much—its wild music, the won-
derfully friendly people, a whole
culture‘ of baby-burdened wom-
‘en in long dresses, men, in sun-
glasses and agbodus, the tradi-«
tional Nigerian costume. ’

We have a cute part of a house
with louvered shutters and a

As one of Moliere’s early and
largely neglected plays, Doctor,
over-lays strong characterization
upon a simple romantic plot: Two
lover-s want to get married. The
girl’s father is against it. Through
trickery, they get married any-
how.

In trickery, Moliere’s characters
excel. Chief among the conivers
is Valere, a servant of ingenious
ways when the need arises. At
other times h-e is a bumbling
half-wit with a yo-yo. “Give me

"an important job,” he asks his

master at one point, “like ﬁnd-
ing out what time it is.”
Actually, the chief victim of
his wiles is an easy man to fool.
Like many early French come-
dies, The Flying Doctor presents

a gullible father who is forever-

being outwitted by his children.
The seemingly wise are stupid;
the stupid are wise.

rector of the play, facial expres-

Pitt News Review

Charlie Brown: The Hero of Our Times

By DON DE CESARE

Long after James Bond is run
down by a runaway Aston-Man
tin and Batman has been stran-
gled by a tight leotard, the real
hero of our times will still be
alive and ageless. His world is

unaffected by Hollywood techno-

logy. His problems come in batch-
es, but none requires a hot line
to the Police Commissioner's of-
fice. He doesn’t wear snappy
clothes or speak “camp” dia-

logue. He can’t even ﬂy a kite. ,

He's just .‘‘good 01’ Charlie

Brown.”

Charlie Brown’s latest adven-

‘ture, Charlie Brown’s All Stars,

was a CBS special on June 8.
Charlie’s team of modern mis-
ﬁts had something for everybody:

i an all-girl outﬁeld, a child-prodi-

-(1.;

 

gy catcher, and baseball’s most
exciting double-play combination,
Snoopy to Linus to Pigpen. Of
couse, the best (and worst) of all,
was Charlie Brown himself.

- Although it’s hard to believe,
Charlie’s team has lost 998
straight games, and there is open
rebellion. Charlie advises every-
one to keep trying. Instead, they
decide to quit. As Lucy says,

“you’re turning us into a bunch
of hypocrites.” The 999th game
has been lost by the score of 123
to 0.

Charlie Brown is the kind of
guy with which everyone can
relate. No matter what he tries,
to do, no matter how good his
intentions, he meets instant and
complete failure. In short, he is
the personiﬁcation of our idea of
the frustrated modern man--a

Charlie’s heart is pure.

If Charlie wasn’t so funny and;
pathetic, any of his friends could
steal all the attention. Lucy, a
tough little cynic, always has the
most appropriate words for any

loser. Despite his shortcomings,

occasion. “If it’s from you, Charlie
Brown, it’s failure news.” Snoopy,
a regal beagle, is the greatest dog
in the world. He can do it all—-
surf in a backyard swimming
pool, steal bases,_ or catch ﬂy
balls in his supper dish. Linus is
a philosopher with an inferiority
complex.‘ His security blanket
prevents him from making the
play at second base, but he is
the only kid who completely un-
derstands all the others. Schroed-
er, Frieda, Violet, and Pigpen are
just hilarious.

At a recent Emmy Awards, A
Charlie Brown Christmas was
named the best children’s show
of 1965-66. It deserved the Emmy
but not the category. Both the

Christmas and the baseball shows
were too good to be simple chil-
dren’s shows. Charlie and his
friends give adults a chance to
laugh at themselves, and there’s
nothing childish about that. It’s
necessary. Frieda asks, “wouldn’t
you like to see Charlie Brown

get a hit?” And Schroeder says,
“No. I’m not prepared to see the
world come to an end.” He's;
right. Charlie’s world should last
for a long time.
