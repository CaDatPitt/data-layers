Greeks on social probation

Staff Report

The University placed all" of its
major fraternities and sororities
on social probation Friday, about
a week after some of their leaders
were caught with alcohol at an
off—campus retreat.

The sanction means that the
more than 30 groups belonging

to the Interfraternity Council,
National Panhellenic Confer-
ence and National Pan-Hellenic
Councilmay not “host, sponsor,
co—sponsor, or participate in any
social activities with non~mem—
bers ANYWHERE,” according to
the Student Code of Conduct.
The probation ‘—— which came
during the middle of IFC’s Rush

Week andthe morning after. the . .

Panhel sororities accepted their

new members % would seem
to be a crackdowneon the Greek
community, which is allowed to

have alcohol at some events if

it does not break any laws -and
has permission from the’ Office of
Fraternity and Sorority Life.
But Vice Provost and Dean of
Students Kathy Humphrey said
the University only checks in

A.on~tho‘sevin social probation if

it receives information about a

potential violation. This week-

end, loud music could be heard T

coming from a few fraternity
houses where people had gath-
ered inside, and some members
of the Greek community said they
disagreed with the sanction be-
cause they didn’t think it was fair
to punish entire groups for their
leaders’ actions.

Steelers to
go to Super
Bowl,  
Oakland

celebrates

_ Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

Fans brought their towels. Police
brought their shields.

When the Pittsburgh Steelers
defeated the New. York Jets 24-19
last night, Pitt students did what
has become almost tradition -
they went out into the streets to
celebrate.

Sounds of twirling Terrible
Towels, shrill cheers and a vuvuze—
la ﬂooded the streets of Oakland
last night around 10 p.m.

Although the crowd began
small, police ofﬁcers in the area
were prepared. About a dozen
ofﬁcers gathered o'n'Forbes and
Bouquet, while about four oﬂicers

“ decked in riot gear patrolled the

Cathedral Lawn. .

But most of the action.hap—
pened outside Essie’s Original Hot
Dog Shop, where TV crews and
their cameras attracted the rowdy
j eers of students.

“We’re on TV!” one guy

screamed while crossing to Forbes
. and Bouquet avenues. 

Police officers stood in the
street, mostly for crowd control.
Other than an occasional “Stay on
the sidewalk,” ofﬁcers remained
unobtrusive.

Memories of a previous Steel- er
ers game were fresh in the minds A

of upperclassmen, who’d seen
Oakland erupt into pandemo-
nium after the Steelers defeated
the Arizonacardinals in the 2009
Super Bowl. After raucous riot-
ing created more than $150,000

University takes action after violation

fraternities, said he was disappointed in
Pitt’s decision to discipline the Greeks

‘ who were not present at the retreat. The

leaders who were at the retreat decided
to take responsibility collectively.

“The University’s decision doesn’t sit
right with me,” he said. “I thought the
acknowledgement that we would take
blame collectively meant that we would

take blame collectively as those attend-

ing.”
Meanwhile, Lauren Jentleson, presi-
dent of Panhel, gave a written statement

leaderswho were in lattvehnldance athtlie ’INI—‘ " ’

‘Teen Mom’
not glamorized

id you know that it’s
MTV’s fault so many teens
are getting pregnant?

Oh wait, a television station
can’t impregnate a person.

And in fact, teen pregnancy
rates actually hit a record low in
2009, according to the National
Center for Health Statistics.

But according to a CNN En-
tertainment article, E! queen
Kim Kardashian “is lashing out
at MTV following reports that 90
girls at a Memphis high school
became teen moms over the past
year.”

On her blog, Kardashian
wrote that shows like MTV’s
“Teen Mom” make teen preg-
nancy seem “cool in the eyes of
young girls.”

“The kids from these shows
are all over the news, even on the
covers of magazines, and have
become almost like celebrities,
but girls, these are not people
you should idolize,” Kardashian
wrote. “Having a baby so young
shouldn’t be seen as the trendy
thing to do.”

We disagree that shows like
“Teen Mom” glamorize teen
pregnancy.» ' .

Instead, we think the show
opens up conversations about
complicated issues like adoption
and abortion. And the fact that
most of us aren’t teens anymore
doesn’t make the issues on the

 

 

 

 

show any less relevant to col-
lege students. One of the main
issues that MTV documents is
balancing school and parenting
— something college moms can
identity with.

We can’t say for sure that no
girls would get pregnant in an
attempt to become famous like
the cast of “Teen Mom,” but we
don’t think a station with a young
audience should entirely avoid
the pressing issue of teen preg-
nancy.

“Teen Mom” Amber Portwood
said the show doesn’t glamorize
anything and instead ‘.‘reveals
how hard it is for all of us. It
shows the heartache we’ve all
gone through.”

We agree. Maybe the stars
of the show are getting paid 0
$60,000 a season, according to
The Hufﬁngton Post, but they are
also getting “diarrhea’ ” on as a
recent episode of “Teen Mom 2”
revealed. Last time we checked,
diarrhea wasn’t cool and glamor-
ous and the teens on the show
weren’t famous beccause they
were “cool,” but rather because
they were on TV. '

So just like many have em-
braced Kardashian’s triumph over
her sex tape, so too it seems that
MTV viewers are rooting for the
teen moms. And lucky for both E!
and MTV, Americans love a good
comeback story. L

LEX AND THE cm!

Let’s make pale the  
newtan

g ‘Lexie Bond
Assistant Opinions Editor

 

At the beginning of last semester,
I terminated my nearly two-year-
long contract at a local tanning
salon. No, I didn’t have a huge
epiphany about the negative health
consequences of fake baking; nor
did I ﬁnally become bothered about
how hypocritical it is for a health
blogger to tan. Instead, I was just
looking to cut back on the expen-
sive habit so I’d have more money
to spend on Pumpkin Pie Pop—Tarts
and top—shelf gin — the breakfast
of champions.

Now it’s hard for me to believe
that for nearly two years, I lathered

up in Black Storm tanning lotion, ‘

applied a Playboy bunny sticker
classily above my bikini area and
patiently stood in an ultraviolet
light—lined vertical cofﬁn for 11
minutes. '

Despite the fact that I once

mixed up the gas and break ped—'

als while driving, I generally like
to consider myself an intelligent
individual. I mean, if I can memo—
rize and ‘master Nicki Minaj’s rap

solos in “Monster” and “Bottoms.

Up,” I’ve got to be somewhat smart.
So why was I willing to commit

$60 and many hours per month '

to something so sure to cause me
to become a dried up golden raisin
well before I needed to? '

I’ll admit it’s not the most non-
sensical thing I’ve done. No, that
award is tied between the time I
chose to search “people using neti
pots” on YouTube and the count-
less hours I wasted playing Mah-
jong on my new laptop over winter
break. . I .

Back to the point — if you’ve
ever seen me, you probably would
have never guessed that I tanned.

Only a few shades darker than
a polar bear, I only ever tanned
to achieve the color of a normal
person.

When I ended what could be
"considered an abusive relationship
with the tanning bed, I expected
to enjoy the extra money and the
extra free time. Instead, I mostly
enjoyed looking at old pictures
of myself from when I was at my
bronzed prime.

Some people pull off the pale ’n’
pasty look really well. Kate Wins-
let, Gwen Stefani, Nicole Kidman,
Martha Washington — some girl-
friends look banging in their Snow
White glory. But me? There was

just something about tanning that '
i made me feel better—looking in my

size XXL granny panties.

Afterl quit, I stopped working
out as much and didn’t care about
eating as healthy. Without my usual
color, I couldn’t ﬁnd myself attrac-

tive, so I let myself go.

Realizing this, I had to wonder
if maybe there was such a thing as
a tanning addiction and if I was
experiencing some sort of with-
drawal symptoms.

A MIiDwEsT’ERN PIECE

so you pthinkyou ‘know the Civilwar?

Mark Koilowski
’ Columnist

 

In the 150 years since the American
Civilwarbroke out, there liasbeen on-
goingdebateastowhyithappened. The
immediate causewas obvious:Aseries
of states decidedtheywantedtoforrna
nation of their own. What caused this
eventto happenis amore diﬂicultpoint
that causes manyanargument eventu-
day. Northerners hold that Southerners
were rebellingto continue to  a
slavocracy. Southemersargue that they
were ﬁghting topreserve their rights

from Northern  pg

' the  little n1‘ore‘¢"5n1p1‘ex .
Why should the  stillberel-'
evant to us today, these 150 years_
later? largely because the impacts of
I the war were widespread enough that
they still affect us inthe 21st century.
‘And in analyzingthe causes of the war
we are reminded of the timeless idea
that realityismessy. ‘ - ‘ n
The causes ofthewararevaried and

complicated by’the shilling politics of
the time. But slavery simply cannot be

' over1ooked.Dr.VanBeckHallofthePitt

history department gives a very good
idea of just how important slaverywas
to the American economy as awhole,
and to that of the South in particular.
He notesthat20—25 percent ofthe total
nationalwealthwas composed ofslaves
atthe startofthewar,that50 percentof
American exports were cotton andthat
so much money could be made off the

‘ institution that one of the best invest-

mentsaMississippiplantercould make
was an investment in more land and
more slaves. This was not an institution

; §0utl1e.rhet§w0L1ld»giVe up easily» ~ I --I

Of course, this doesn’t explain why
the South chose to secede around 1860.
At the time of his inauguration, Abra-

~ hamLincolnwas hardlyanabolitionist

ﬁrebrand, and the official policy of the
RepublicanPartywasto leave slaveryin
place where it-already existed. Indeed,
Dr. Hall mentions thatthe 13thAmend-
ment actually failed to pass through
Congress aslateas1864, showinghow

even late in the war politicians were
uncomfortable with the idea of eman-
cipation. In 1860, slavery was under
no imminent threat. In fact, Dr. Hall
believes thathadthe South notseceded,
slavery would have continued -— per-
haps even up to the start of the 20th
century. .

So, why did the Southsecede? Dr.
Hall holds t-hat Southern slaveholders
fearedtheir nonslaveholdingbrethren
would eventuallyfall underthe sway of
-Lincoln andthe Republicans, leadingto

I‘ the gradualformation ofan abolitionist

party in the South. The slaveholders
saw secession as a kind of insulation
againstexactly this. The second broad
causewasthe problems created by the
Mexican-American War and general
westward expansion as “it forced the-
politicians to do something [about the
expansion of slavery] when for a long
time they tried to leave the question
alone,” Dr. Hall said. When politicians.
hadto do something, he explains, they
endedup fatally dividingthe Democrat-
ic Partybetween supporters of Stephen

A.Douglasandpopularsovereig11tyand

, John C. Breckinridge and the absolute

right of slaveholding. Dr. Hall citesthis
as the point of no return leading down
the slopeto the CivilWar. So civilwarin
the Democratic Party translated into a
larger conflict

It would also be a mistake to be-
lieve that Secession was a decision all
Southerners were comfortable with.
Two major factions emerged: con-
ditional unionists and Secessionists.
Conditional unionists, such as eventual
Confederate Vice PresidentAlexander
Stephens,wantedto adopt await—and—
see approach, and see if the Republi-
cansactually did proveasunreasonable
as some in the South believed them to
be. Secessionists wanted to move im-
mediately, seeing nothingto gainfrom
patience. Eventually, the Secessionists
won the argument in Charleston, and
so we went toward war.

Another misconception is that
all Northerners were ﬁghting to end
slavery and believed ending slavery
was a good idea. The New York draft

riots of 1863 took on an ugly racial
tinge as many Irish in the city began
to see blacks as the source of all their
woes. The Colored Orphan Asylum
wasburned, adozen blackpeople were
killed by the mob and Federal troops
had to be called in to restore order.
Much as it would be wrong to say that
every Confederate privatewas ﬁghting
to supportslavery, itwouldbewrongto
saythateveryNort.’nernerwas enthusi-
astic aboutfreeingthe slaves. .
' Though the war primarily began
because of slavery, itwas not explicitly
aboutslaveryuntil reasonablylater on.

‘ Infact, Dr. Hall believes thatwhat ended

slavery was, indirectly, Robert E. Lee’s
victory in the Peninsular Campaignof
1862. Had Lee lost, Richmond would
have fallen and the war might have
ended with slaverystill intact in the
South. Reality is often messierthanwe
would like it to be, and it is particularly

According to The New York

The Skin Cancer'Foundation
Journal, Dr. Robin L. Hornung and
Solmaz Poorsattar of the University
of Washington in Seattle reported

that the “continued purposeful ex- -

posure to a known cancer—causing
agent suggests that factors besides
lack of knowledge are driving in-
dividuals to tan.”

Since I recently came into some

. money, my urge to once again pick

foundation that matches my cur-
rent “Night of the Living'Dead”

Because I no longer tan, 1 now I
have time to Watch “Titanic” five
times per week instead of four.

_ up my bad habit was strong. So I
_ did what any normal girl would do

and purchased expensive French

skin tone. I ﬁgured tanning after
that splurge would just seem far
too wasteful to justify.

More important than the pur-
chase itself were the comments I
received while in the cosmetics
shop. The employee that picked
out the foundation shade for me
said how beautiful my complexion
was. And the cashier that rang up
my makeup told me that the foun-
dation looked so good on me that I
was glowing. Hey, maybe I can pull

A off the pale look after all.

I ultimately decided that tan-i

ning is a vain and unhealthy ad-
diction that I needed to break. In

is it possibletobecoime addictedto the tanning salon?

addition, I also wasn’t willing to
give up the extra time and money
that I had gotten so accustomed to.
Because I no longer tan, I now have
time to watch “Titanic” ﬁve times
per week instead of four. I also am
saving up to get the entire lyrics to
Bonnie T‘yler’s “Total Eclipse of the
Heart” tattooed on my back. Just
kidding. Maybe.

Series focuses on contemporary queemess

An ongoing campus event encourages

people to see beyond some precon— ‘

ceptions of queemess and to discover
it as it is represented in cinema.
Cathy Hannabach, a visiting lec-
turer and director of the Contem-
porary Queer Cinemas Public Film
Series, has organized a series of free
screenings on campus. The series’is
sponsored by the women’s studies

FASHION COLUMN

Trendy fashion failures should serve as lessons 

department and the ﬁlms are meant
to call attention to queemess in nar-
rative, spaces and different national
contexts. ' '

Most of the ﬁlms are shown on
Wednesday nights in 3415 Posvar
Hall, with the exception of a ﬁlm

screening and director’s talk with .

Monica Enriquez-Enriquez, which
will be held at the Kelly—Strayhom
Theater on March 2.

“A lot of people don’t have a good
understanding of what ‘queer’ really
is, and so by looking at the queer-
ness of children, the queemess of

‘vampires, how space and race are

constructedinthese very queer man-
ners, it’s really expanded all of our
deﬁnitions of what it truly means to
be queer,” said Rachel Ackerrnan, one
of Hannabach’s students.

Arts Entertainment 

“The project as a whole takes a *

cultural studies approach to ﬁlm.
Rather than looking at individual
ﬁlmsias isolated texts, there’s been
a huge push in critical ﬁlm studies
over the past several years to look
at production as a set of practices
irreducible to just a ﬁlm as a te ,”
Hannabach added. 9
Consequently, the series also fo-

cuses on circulation, distribution and _

exhibition practices with an interest
in the norms they embody and the
role they play in shaping our experi-
ence of cinema.

As Hannabach put it, the project

' is “part of a desire to think about

ﬁlm studies as something that has a
unique, public dimension. There’s a
strong emphasis on public cultures:

Going with what ’s “in” can sometimes lead to some fashion disasters that couldbe easily avoided" by following a few rules

Bethie Girmai
Columnist

Although some might be blessed
with impeccable taste and style,
no one is immune to the wrath of
the fashion gods. Whether you’re
great at mixing and matching
trends or the poster child for re-
vamping tired styles, you are just
as likely as anyone to fall prey to
one of the most offensive fashion
faux pas. Even I have been guilty
of breaking the No. 1 rule in the
proverbial fashion bible: Always
stay true to your own style.

The easiest way to break the
golden rule is by religiously fol—
lowing trends. Many people have
bought pieces for their wardrobe
solely because they are in style.
But just because a trend is popu-
lar doesn’t mean it will automati-
cally look good on you or ﬁt with
your overall sense of style.

I’ve been guilty of subscribing
to the latest fashion fad many a
time. And granted, I have a few
items in my closet I’m not proud

of, which likewise, aren’t proud
of me. I can’t forget my mishap
with harem pants during the sum-
mer of ’o8. And I will never live
down my matchingjuicy Couture
velour sweatsuits. Though shop-
ping for trends is an art that takes
practice and a little structure, it’s
definitely not impossible.

When shopping for trends,
you should always ask yourself,
“If this weren’t a popular item
this year, would I still buy it?” If
you answer this question with a
resounding yes, then it may be an
item that you will want to use for
many years to come.

However, if you answer no,
chances are you’re just interested
in the item because everyone else
is. A
T Secondly, you must.ask your-
self, “Is this item practical?” If
you don’t think you’ll get a sig-
nificant amount of wear out of
a_ piece, or at least your money’s
worth, it will probably be doomed
to a long imprisonment in the
deep depths of your closet.

Lastly, ask yourself if the item

in question not only supplements
the rest of your wardrobe, but

complements it as well. If you '

prefer skinny jeans and a ﬂan-
nel shirt, the khakis and oxford
ruffled tank that everyone seems

. to have probably won’t comple-

art form and a means for self-

expression. Therefore, much
of what populates the runways
in New York, Paris and Milan is
completelyimpractical.

Most people wouldn’t dream
of wearing McQueen shoes on

And ll Will never live down

my matching Juicy Couture 

velour sweatsuits.

ment anything in your closet. If
you want to invest in a trend that
strays out of your typical comfort
zone, just ﬁnd a variation of the
style that is more practical for
you. -
Religiously following trends
goes hand in ‘hand with another

"addendum to the golden rule:

Don’t take all your fashion cues
from the runway.
To many people, fashion is an

a trip to the grocery store or a
Balenciaga dress to a workplace
Christmas party — and for good

reason.

Just like every other trend,
trends that originate on the
runway should be implemented
intolyour wardrobe carefully and
sparingly.

Furthermore, trends that .
grace our favorite runways typi- _

cally aren’t made for the average

woman, but for 5—foot-10, size 2 Q

models. So we should wear_these
trends accordingly. Most of us
don’t model'for a living, so run-
way trends"might not work for
all of us.

If a certain style doesn’t flat-

_’ ter your particular shape or
-body type,‘you shouldn’t wear

it. Always think past the trends
in the pages of Vogue and think
instead of how they will look on

you, not Gemma Ward or Natalie ‘

Portman; Even if you’ve fallen
completely in love with a trend,

if it doesn’t ﬂatter you, there’s no ~

use inwearing it.

So remember to always stay
true to your fashion sense. Never
compromise your style for a pass-
ing fad, always invest in items
with staying power and buy for

_ style, practicality and comfort.

But most of all, remember that
sometimes the fashion gods don’t
know what’s best. Instead, have
a little faith in your inner fash-
ionista, because she is the only
one who will always know what’s
best for you. I

Isaac Saul
Stajf Writer

The No. 5 Pitt men’s basketball “

team will attempt to defend its
untarnished Big East record to-
night as- the Panthers (19—1, 7-0

Big East) face -a top-25 team for

the second time in three games
in No. 16 Notre Dame.
The Irish (16—4, 5-3.Bi_g East)
re.comin_g:off an important 80-
 over Marquette, avenging
a loss to the Golden Eagles 12 days
prior.
In the win, senior guard Ben

Hansbrough, the younger broth- .

er of former North Carolina All-
American Tyler Hansbrough, had
a, career-high 28 points and led

the second half rally that helped _ -

Notre Dame pull away for the
win. '

‘ “I think he’s one of the best_

players in the country,” Marquette
head coach Buzz Williams said af-
ter the game against the Irish; “He
plays with a high motor. I think
he’s extremely competitive, moves
without the ball as well as anyone

in the country and his shot is part
of the pass. ,

Hansbrough leads the Irish
with 18 points per game.

Before Ha_nsbrough’s explosion
that helped Notre Dame pull away,
the Irish, facing an 11-point deﬁ-
cit, switched to a zone defense to
contain the Golden Eagles.

Following the win, Notre Dame '

head coach Mike Brey said the
Irish didn’t have any answers for
the Golden Eagles when they were
playing man-to-man. I '
“So let’s try to change their

' rhythm a little bit,” Brey said.

“Their shots came up but in a little
different rhythm [after the switch
to" a zone defense].”

Although the zone was effec-
tive ag_ain'st Marquette, last week
Nasir Robinson tallied 21 points
as Pitt conducted a clinic on how
to tear. up No. 3 Syracuse’s highly
touted zone defense. The Panthers
scored 19 straight points to start
the game. _

“We didn’t want to settle for
jump shots against the zone,
[Syracuse’s] 3-point shooting

Pantherslook to stay undefeated in Big East)  

percentage is ridiculously low,”
Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said
after his team’s 74-66 win over the
Orange. “We knew we had to get
interior touches and baskets. You
have to break a zone with a team,
not just one man, and we did that '
for the most part.”

Both Notre Dame and Pitt play
well at home. Notre Dame boasts a

13-0 record on its home ﬂoor this »

season. But the Irish will have to
face the Panthers inside the Pe..— -
tersen Events Center, where Pitt

’ has won 51 of its last 52 games,

including two wins against top
ﬁve teams this season.

The Irish haven’t won a road
game all season.

After the Marquette win, Notre
Dame senior Tim Abromaitis said
he expects the Panthers to be pre-
pared for their matchup with the
Irish. Abromaitis is second on
the team in scoring, averaging
13 points a game. r>

“They’ve proven themselves to

' be a really tough team,” he said.

“I think we will be excited for it,
but they are deﬁnitely ready for

Pitt 80, DePaul so

After never trailing No. 3 Syracuse on
Monday night,‘the Pitt men’s basket-
ball team had to ﬁght off a second-half

surgeﬁ'omBigEastbottom-feederDe- -

Paul Saturday afternoon. -

But with two timely second-half
baskets from Lamar. Patterson and a
36-13 rim in the game’s ﬁnal 12 min-

. .utes, No. 5 Pitt (19—1, 7-0 Big East)

pulled away to avoid an upset, defeat— A
ingthe BlueDemons 80-50 atthe All-

, state Arena.

The Panthers'cou1dn’t ﬁnd their
rhythm on offense to start the game

and when DePaul freshman Cleveland
Melvin converted an offensive board

into a basket, he knotted the game at »

10 with 12:11 leftinthe ﬁrsthalf.
Melvin ﬁnished with a team-high

11 points. DePaul (6-13, 0-7 Big East)

head coach Oliver Purnell said in a

' news release that the Panthers. did a

good job defending Melvin. '

“Pittsburgh did an outstandingjob
of banging him,” he said. “They kept
him squared up and would not give
him a path to the basket “

Pitt head. coach Jamie Dixon
praised Melvin in the same release,
saying that he is a big-time recruit for
the Blue Demons.

“We were able to keep some size
and quickness on him and-not let
him beat us off the drive,” Dixon said.

“We didn’t give him many offensive
rebounds. He has a great knack of
coming up with loose balls and put-
ting them in quickly.”

' Two Tony Freelandfreethrows put
the Blue Demons ahead 14-12, but a
ﬁve—minute, 17-4 rim gave Pitt a 29-18
lead with 4:12 remaining inthe open-
ing half. Thanks to strong play from
Brad Wanamaker — who scored all
nine of his points before halftime —
the Panthers went to the locker room
leading 38-23.

“We battled to stay within striking

’ distance,” Purnell said. “But then we

took bad shots, committed turnovers
and missed defensive assignments.” ‘

The second half started like the
opening halfended as Gilbert Brown
hit an early 3-pointer that stretched

Pitt’s leadto18.BrownledallPanthers
with 17 points. I

But Purnell called timeout after
Brown’s basket, and his Blue Demons
swungmomentumbackintheiriavor,
cuttingthe deﬁcit to nine, 42-33, with
14:12 to go.

The Panthers missed sevenstraight
shots after Brown’s 3-pointer, and
the Blue Demons crept within seven

_points.

Thatwas the closestDePaulwould
come.

Up 47-37, Wanamaker found Pat-
terson for an open layup, and the

freshman hit a 3-pointer less than at .
-_ minute later to put the game out of

DePaul’s reach. Wanamakerﬁnished
with nine assists. 3
“Pittsburgh is a greatteam, so deep

andsophysi ,”Purnellsaid.“'I‘hey’ve
got a number of guys who can take over
a game at stretches, particularly their

 perimeter players.”

A 36-13 Panthers rim ‘closed out,-,
the game and handed DePaul its 20th
consecutive Big East loss.

The Panthers won the rebounding
battle 48-33 and Gary McGhee had a
career-highlsboards. 

The game marked a milestone for
Ashton Gibbs as well. The guard scored”
his 1,000th careerpointinthe second

AN OLTMANN’S OPINION

January 24, 2011 I The Pitt News I wWW.pittneWs.com

Walker. leads

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

  

It’s the Heisman trophy of college basketball.
TheJohn R. Wooden Award, founded in 1976,
is handed out every year to thepremier play-
or in men’s college basketball. While we’re a
little more than halfway through the season,
I thought I’d take a look at the top ﬁve can-

‘ didates to win the award right now. All the

candidates have one thing in common: Their

teams are among the nation’s elite and they 1

are the primary reasons whytheir squads are
where they are right now. A ‘

Who might be college basketball’s Cam’
’ Newton or Tim.Tebow? « — I

5. Nolan Smith, Duke 4- Dukeseems to
have a great point guard every year, and this
season is no exception. The senior is averag-
ing a little more than 20 points per game. As
the natural leader on the ﬂoor, he has carried

the team since freshman phenom Kyrie Irving A V

went down with an injury Dec."4. Smith ran
the point for Duke?s championship team last
season, and I expect him to lead another Blue
Devils team on a deep NCAA Tournament run

~ this season.

- 4. JaJuan Johnson, Purdue — When
starguard Robbie Hummelvwent out with a-

' knee injury earlythis season, the Boilermak- I

ers knew they would need Johnson to step
up — and he has. Like Smith, the senior is
averaging just over 20 points per game, and
although he stands at 6 feet 10 _inches tall,
the center can step away from the basket and
knockdown outside shots. Although many
analysts counted Purdue out of the Final Four
after Hummel went down,Johnson-is making

the Boilermakers a threat to get to Houston

once again. ' . -

3.Ji-mmer Fredette, BYU - The knock on
Fredette is that he doesn’t play against enough
quality competition in the Mountain West.
Conference, but c’mon, he’s leading the na-
tion in scoringwith 26.7 points per game. Not
only that, but he dropped 47 and_ 42 points

cuntry’s best players

in separate games in just under two weeks.
In the 42-point game against Colorado State
Saturday, he was 4—of-9‘ from the 3-point line
and someof the threes he was making we're

- from well beyond NBA range. As for the knock

that he isn’t'scoring against topcompetition,
he scored 33 and 25 points against Arizona and
UCLA thisseason, respectively. The guardhas
led the Cougars to a top-10 ranking and could
lead them on a. deep tournament run.‘

~ 2. Jared Sullinger, Ohio State ,+ The
true freshman has taken the nation by storm
this season‘, averaging 17.9 points and 10.2
rebounds per game while leading the Buckeyes
to an undefeated record and the.No: 1 ranking
in the country. At 6 foot 9_ inches tall and 280
pounds, Sullinger is a force in the paint. While
watching Ohio State play I_llin'ois Saturday,
where Sullinger scored.27.points and pulled
down 16 rebounds, I wor'1dered:,Who were the

_ ‘ poor souls who had to guard this'kidjust_ one
1 year ago when he’was in high school? Whoever

they were, my condolencesgo out to them. As
for Sullinger, this will surely be his one and
only year in college, and it just might end with
a National Championship.’ ‘

1. Kemba Walker, Connecticut 4- The
senior guard ranks just behind Fredette in
scoring _wit_;h25 points per game and is pretty
much the one andonly reason why the Huskies
are ranked in the top 10 this season. Connecti-
cut wasn’t ranked in the top 25 entering the
season, but after averaging 30 points in three
early season tournament games in Maui, Ha-
waii, the Huskies and Walker made a statement

to America that they were for real. The whole '

team centers around Walker’s abilities, and for
this reason alone, he’s also the most valuable
player in the country. Walker is simply a pure
scorer. In Connecticut’s loss at Pitt earlier this
season, itseemed to me that Walkerwas strug-
gling to make any shots._Yet_ when I looked at
the ﬁnal box score, he had 31 points. He goes

up against some of the best competition in -V

the country on a nightly basis and dominates.
Walker’s the best player in the country. I

us. It should be a good game.”

,. Pitt is coming off its ninth" straight win
after an 80-50 trouncing of DePaul on Sat-
urday. DePaul, although a heavy underdog,
was the kind of trap game that catches in-
experienced teams looking ahead to a big
matchup later in the week. But Pitt’s experi-
ence allowed it to overcome that hurdle. ‘

Pitt’s seniors continued their consistent
dominance in the win, making sure the Pan-
thers stayed on track. Gilbert Brown led all
scorers with 17 points, Gary McGhee led all

. rebounders with 15 boards, and Brad Wana-

maker led all players with nine assists.
Dixon said the seniors’ dedication to
improvement carries over to the rest of

flan 1-oath

“We have improved dramatically over

- just two months’ time, and our seniors have

done some incredible work to improve
themselves,” Dixon said. “When you see
your seniors improve like this, then it gives

inspiration to all your players.”

In the teams’ last meeting, Notre Dame _
beat the Panthers at Madison Square Gar-
den, 50-45. That win completed an Irish
sweep of the Panthers last season.

Pitt will look for some revenge as it at-
tempts to keep its winningistreak alive. I
