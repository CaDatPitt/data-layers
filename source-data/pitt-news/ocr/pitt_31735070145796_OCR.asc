Bigelow Bash 2.0 beginstoday

Tara Nair
Staff Writer

Pitt Program Council will kick Off
an expanded version of its annual
Bigelow Bash today.

The new version, called Bigelow
Bash 2.0, will include a spring con-
cert and a carnival, making it more
similar to the event Carnegie Mel-
lon holds each spring to the envy
of Pitt students.

The bash will run from 3 to 11
p.m. tonight, 1 to 11 p.m. tomorrow
and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday — two
days longer than it has lasted in
the past.

    

PPC special events director and
Pitt juniorjillian Reillysaid people
suggest getting a Ferris wheel for

' Bigelow Bash every year, and the

organization decided to expand
on that idea. It hired a carnival
company. _ »

“We wanted to step it up and
make things different and exciting.
[The carnival company is] bringing
multiple carnival rides  real rides,
not just blowups,” Reilly said.

In addition to a Ferris wheel,
Swank’s. Steel City Shows, a local
professional carnival company that
will run Bigelow Bash and" also rims
CMU’s annual carnival, will bring

a Monkey Maze —— a walkthrough
funhouse, with mirrors — and
three other adult rides called The
Hurricane, Zero Gravity and the
High Flyer, as well as a short—range
basketball game.

Patty Swank, co-owner and op-
erator ofSwank’s Steel City Shows,
said the company won’t bring more
family rides and games because
Reilly requested it bring the maxi-

mum number of rides that could fit .

in the event space. .

The company provides employ-
ees who work for them throughout
the year to run all of the games,
rides and food.

Swank said there will  lemon-‘

ade, corndogs, funnel cakes, Icees
and frozen treats. ‘

' Pitt Program Council members
will work the ticket booth, which
Reilly said will probably be on the

sidewalk outside the William Pitt’

Union by 13-igelow.Boulevard. Stu-

dents can purchase tickets the day . 4

they want to ride the rides.

Pitt students can purchase $5‘ '

all-day wristbands for unlimited

rides or pay $2 per ride. Non-stu— '

dents can pay $10 for an all-day
wristband or $4 per ride. Games
and food will be available fora
cash fee.

PPC: ‘Throw out your opinions of the past’

_Bigelow Bash 4 1 \

Carnival setup began at noon yesterday

and was scheduled to continue through this v_

morning, with the exact setup time depend-
ing upon the weather, Swank said. Electrical
equipment and rides had to be transported
from the Swank’s storage facility in Apollo,
Pa., which is about an hour northeast of
Pittsburgh. , .

Rock bandJack’s Mannequin will perform
at 3 p.m. Sunday. Sleepy V and Sleeping with a‘
Bullet, the winner and runner-up in the PPC-

. A and WPTS-sponsored Battle of the Bands last

February, will perform as opening acts.
Some students have expressed a lack
of enthusiasm for the Bash based_o'n past
years. ‘ ‘
‘ “I’d like to see better bands,” sophomore

Danieljohnston said, referring to previous ‘

Bigelow Bash artists. “I mean, Penn State
has -Jay—Z. PPC did get Kid Cudi and Jack’s

Mannequin though, so my faith is being _

restored.” '
PPC is working to change students’ as-
sumptions about the event. Its website has

a “caution” message telling people to “throw '
' out your opinions of the past and embrace

the future ‘concept of this new event.”
Pittjunior Brett Carly, who worked at last
year’s Bigelow Bash, thought poor weather
made the event less of a success.
“The caricature line was ridiculous, and

so was the line for airbrushed t—shirts,” she ’

said. _ _ .
Reilly said PPC won’t have those activities

I this year because the carnival rides will take

up all the room they have. ‘
Sophomore Susan Schwend said that she
didn’t attend Bigelow Bash last year because,

she only heard about it the day of event and

she .didn’t have time to go.
“I’m not really into those events  but
I love Jack’s Mannequin. Perfect. I’m going

on Sunday,” Schwend said, realizing while '

she was talking that the concert was on
Sunday. ’ - ' .
Planning for the Bashbegan last semester,

' in late October. Reilly said that the special
events committee members brainstormed a _

date. The committee then chose the artist

based on who ﬁt its pricerange.
‘ Reilly said that PPC has a budget that gets
split up among each of its committees.

_“We have to budget our money according ,_

to what activities we want to do that year.

Since .it’s a carnival this year, it’s been a lot
of going back and forth with the carnival
c_ompany and seeing what rides and games
are available,” Reilly said.

She said the special events committee is
unsure of what the total cost is right now.

“We keep an ambulance- there all week-
end, and we have to pay for security and
facilities. So we have to wait until all of those
bills come in,” Reilly said. '

EDITORIAL

CASUAL      

FRIDAYS  

fter more than a year of in-
 wq, the storefront be— '
een Hemingvvay’s and The

Original Hot Dog Shop is beginning
to show signs of life.

Located inthe heart ofPitt’s campus
on Forbes Avenue, the nook is sure
to be reoccupied soon. Yesterday,
we conﬁrmed that the space will, in
fact,become aDunkin’ Donuts —but
this struck us as an opportunity to
look around ourcampus andwonder
what else is missing. Beloware afew
establishments that Oakland could
really use. Call it wishful thinking.

A 24-hour diner

How does Oakland not have one of
these? Pittstudents need somewhere

to go after all-night study sessions

and midnight mass.Atﬁ.u1kyhours,

students don’t have much of a choice

for cuisine right now, and Pamela’s

Diner closes before we’re even done

with class for the day. A 24-hour
schedule and low prices would be

more than enoughto satisfy.

Oﬂrice for Pit1’s governmental
relations

The University could buy the space
and use it to house a governmental
relations department. Between Pitt’s
regularly getting shafted in state ap-
propriations and its laissez-faire ap-
proach to defending students caught
up inthe G-20 protests, we’restarting
to doubt that an oﬁice already exists
elsewhere.

Cheesesteak joint
Moving from Philadelphia to Pitts-

burgh can feel like movingto another
dimension —— worse food, a better

football team and a noticeably ab- _

senteffortto pronounce vowels.Last
year, Souf Oakland Steaks vanished
as mysteriouslyas ithad arrived. Ever
since, there hasn’t beenlan Oakland

establishment solely dedicated to
perfecting the cheesesteak. If one
were to do so, it could ‘help native
Philadelphians ease their collective
transition into ‘Steel Tahn.’

Another Rite Aid
Anyone who’s lived in Oakland for

more than a feweweeks has realized
its more glaring problem: There just

aren’t enough Rite Aids. When the .
two Rite Aids (conveniently located .

next to each other) run out of ping
pong balls, where’s astudent to go?
cvs Pharmacy? Please. ‘

Besides, one of the Rite Aids closes

' at night, leaving the other with a

monopoly over the Atwood Street
mixer market.

« Boomerang’s

You know those nights when you
want to dance, but not enougl1 to
go to a dance club? Or how about

~ those nights when you want to go

for a drink, but not enough to go to
a real bar? They should open aplace
in the vacant storefront thafs a bar,
but not really good at being a bar,

and also a dance club where no one ‘

really dances. They can call it Boo-

" merang’s.

Miniature golfeourse

Although there are countless things
to do in Pittsburgh at night, most of
them require havingacaroraPh.D.
in the Port Authority’s late-night
schedule. Those of us trying to stay

in Oakland, on the other hand, are.

generally conﬁned either to’ goingto
abar or gettinghalf—pricedfood.This
brings us to our least realistic — yet
most impo1tant— recommendation
of the day: a miniature golf course.
Just imagine the possibilities. The
18th hole could even be themed like
a doughnut shop, because Oakland
could really use one of them, too.

Bring a plant indoors and reap the benefits

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

  
 

So I had just spent the night writing
the dullest paper I had written in a
longtime.Ihadn’tgotten any sleep and
barely had anything to show for it — I
know you’ve been there too. I had just
wasted an entire night’s worth of rest
on a topic I never cared about.

Butas Iwas about to accept my fail-
ure and walk dejectedly to class, I saw
anunlarniliarsight outside mywindow
that lifted myspirits. Overthe course of
the night, the tulips that my landlord
plantedinfront of my apartmentbuild—

"ing had bloomed. .

As we progress ﬁirther into spring
and start seeing the sun again, it gets
so much harderto be satisﬁed with the
ﬂuorescent lights and bland walls of a

-classroom. Butatthe same time, weall
knowthattryingto hold class or study
outside usually leads to daydreaming
and sleeping. . .

To me, it’s obviouswhywelikebeing
outdoors and around plants. It’s that
feeling ofbeing closeto something else
that’s vibrant and alive; the smell ofthe
grass and how it feels under your bare

feet.It’sthesamefeelingIgetwhenIgo I

tion—beingconnectedto nothingbut

But this kind of pastoral fantasy is

g hard to come by in’Oal<land’s urban ,

jungle, especially when most patches
of grass are saturated with sunbath-
ing students. What’s more, I’ll be stuck
indoors for the next three weeks with
ﬁnals just around the comer and sum-
mer classes starting soon after.

I don’t really know which plants
work best indoors so I suppose it’s
something worthwhile to research.
Multiple studies have shown that in-
door plants greatly improve produc-
tivity and employee retention in the
workplace. There are even companies
dedicatedto creatingabalancebetween
cubicles and plants.

Becausetheycanbe associatedwithdifl
ferent places, ideas and people, plants
allow us to take a break from our daily
routines and focus on something other

. than work or school.

Rightnow, you’re probablythinking'
about why youwould waste time and
money on something that you can get
forfree outside. Even thoughthat might
be the case right now, the Pittsburgh
summer will come and go before you
know it. Indoor plants have beneﬁts

They grew, and they were
part of something alive.

_And this kind of literally green-dé-
cor is not reserved for the office. It’s
something that everyone can do to
improve the look and feel of his or her
own indoor livingspace. '

Plants have also been shownto irn—

Science.corn, a science news website.

that last all year long. They’ve been
shown to reduce stress and improve
airquality. A joint stiidybetween NASA
and the Associated Landscape Con-
tractors of America found that plants
improve indoorairqualitybyremoving
trace organic pollutants from the air.

> They even have the potential to
provide their caretakers with a taste

of fresh produce. The people over at

’Wrndowfarms, a project addressing -
urban agriculture goals, have devised '

a way to create farms that’ll ﬁt right
in the conﬁnes of a window. By using
cheap and accessible items like plastic
bottles and rubbertubing, they’ve cre-
ated a system that grows vegetables
hydroponically, in mineral solutions
and not soil.

It’s this kind of innovation thatwill
allow us to keep our plants around
even in the dead of winter. The colder
months often induce seasonal affec-
tive disorder, given the general lack of
light. But indoor plants could be away
of combating such problems.

The beneﬁts and applications of
having plants inside your house are
numerous. It’s something we can take
advantage of nowand won’t have to let
go of, even when the weatherworsens.
By exploring the possibilities of such
an idea, we can hopefully ﬁnd ways to
make our lives a little less dreary.

Music worshippers revel at the Altar Bar

April 9, 2010 4| The Pitt News l wWw.pittneWs.com

After converting itself from a. house of worship to a music venue, the Altar Bar has become a hot spot for the under—21 crowd.

Jordan Streussnig
Staﬁfwriter

For some people, music is a re-
ligion, and in Pittsburgh Altar
Bar offers a sanctuary for music
worshippers of all ages.

Altar Bar, like Mr.~Smalls, is
an old church reborn as a music
venue. '

Located in the Strip District,
the building that is now Altar Bar
served as St. Elizabeth’s Catholic
Church, but since its renovation
in 2000, the ‘building’s mission
went from spreading the faith to

resurrecting live music in Pitts— A

burgh.”

Altar Bar consultant Chad
Hardy explained that the transi-
tion from church to music venue
is surprisingly logical.

“When you think about it, a
church space realistically was
built for masses,” said Hardy.
“So when you talk about possible
uses, there’s a lot of potential.”

He also noted that churches
have naturally great acoustics.

Despite the possible contro-
versy that might arise from the
conversion of a house of God into
a house of rock, Hardy said the
transition was calm, with the ex-
ception of a few ugly comments
from people passing by on the
street. -

Since then, Altar Bar found
its place on the Pittsburgh music
and bar scene and benefits from
a rise in underage crowds that
flock to the Strip for live music.

According to Altar Bar mar-
keting assistant Brittany Hoy-

dich, the venue is becoming a hot

spot for the under—21 crowd.

“With Altar’s location, great
music is essentially just a bus
ride away for many students,”
Hoydich said. ' _'

“This past fall, a show that
did extremely well was the AP
Tour Fall Ball, which featured The
Academy Is..., Mayday Parade,
Set Your Goals, The Secret Hand-
shake and You Me at Six. It was a
sold—out crowd,” said Hoydich.

This February, Altar Bar
hosted sold—out performances by
Donnie Iris and the Cruisers and

Mr Greengenes, said Hoydich.

“Donnie Iris and the Cruis-
ers is always a favorite be-
cause of Iris’ ties to Pittsburgh.
Mr.Greengenes, on the other
hand, is a cover band from Phila-
delphia that primarily performs
rock songs,” she said.

Despite being a music venue,
Altar Bar sometimes thinks out-
side the confessional box.

On March 19, for instance, the
venue hosted The Art Institute of
Pittsburgh’s fashion show, “Ren—
egade: Rebellion on the Runway,”
featuring clothing from local de-
signers and boutiques. A

“So while-Altar is primarily a

music venue, we do on occasion .

hold college events and private
parties,” Hoydich said.

“Because it’s a smaller venue,
it’s more intimate. Instead of
making you feel detached, it re-
ally puts you right in the middle
of the show,” she said.

 

 

' Altar Bar’s lower level has a
private VIP lounge and bar, and
the main level features a full-
size stage and runway. Above
the stage, there is a private party
room that can be rented out.

The 650—capacity venue ﬁlls
up quickly, but the variety of
space almost guarantees every-
one will ﬁnd a‘ niche. .

Don’t be fooled by'the stained glass windows, the Strip.District’s Altar
A Bar isn’t as holy as it looks.

MOVIE REVIEW  

Fiery phantasrna lights up screen, in ‘Dragon’

   

 

Courtesy Dreamworks
Dragons are awesome.

 

Kelsey Shea

“Howto Train Your Dragon”
Dreamworks
Starring: Gerard Butler andjay Ba-
ruchel
B+

It’s a good thing that my best friend
fromsecond grade andlwenttothelate
showing of “How to 'I‘rain Your Drag-
on,”becausewe giggledlike 8-year,-olds
throughout the entire thing.

Iftherehadbeen anyoneinthethe-
aterotherthanafew otherweirdos, we
would have been embarrassed by our »
childlike enthusiasm.

Dreamworks’ latest computer-
animated ﬁlm, “How to Train Your
Dragon,” is pretty much everything
an animated movie should be — cute,
funny, suitable for all ages and decked
out with impressive animau'on,- fun
characters and a clever storyline.

The movie follows I-Iiccup (voiced
byjay Baruchel), ascrawnyyoungboy

who can’tseemto eamthe approval of

hispeersorhis colossaldragon-ﬁghting

dad, Stoick (voicedbyGerard Butler). Ins

anefforttogainVildngstreetcred,I-Iic-
cup decides to hunt himselfa dragon.
Butwhenhe hits a“NightFury”—

' one of the rarest and most dangerous

dragons—the dragon meanttobehis
prey becomes his playmate, and the
two form an unusual friendship.

The movie’s appeal is obvious —
anyﬁlminvolving dragons and Vikings
is probably goingtobeawinner—but
“HowtoTrainYour Dragon” outdoes it-
selfwithgreatanimaubn, solidwriting
andvery likable characters ——including*
anador‘ablé,(butslightlyscar'y) dragon
with oddly puppy—like qualities.

Intruth, “HowtoTrainYour Drag-
on’ ’success isn’tsurprising.Itfollows
a familiar formula of cute and slightly
awkwardcharacters,loveable animals,
heartwarmingscenes andamoral—ﬁlled
message atthe end.

But it’s a formula that works, and
“I-Iowto TrainYour Dragon” executes
it wonderfully. »

FILM REVIEW I

Film draws local insights

Patrick Wagner
Sta_ﬂ"Wri ter

“My Tale of'I‘wo Cities”

Starring: Carl Kurlander, Louie Ander-
son '

Directed by Carl Kurlander

Grade: B-

Fihnmakers sometimes get caught up in lo-
cales. Woody Allen’s New York and Christopher
Nolan’s Chicago are as much characters in those
directors’ movies as the real-life actors they
direct. In “My Tale of'I‘wo Cities,” Pitt professor
and,co—writer of “St. Elrno’s Fire” Carl Kurlander
made Pittsburgh not just one of the characters
but the star.

The documentary focuses on two intercon-

nected ideas. The ﬁrst is Kurlander’s personal
journey to reconcile his relationship with his
hometown after moving back ﬁ'om Los Angeles,
and the second is Pittsburgh’s economic down-
turn in the latter half of the 20th century and
how the city can get back on its feet.

Before he moves on to their current condi-
tions, Kurlander details his formative experienc-
es —— including a female bully who threatened to
burn him with a cigarette ifhe didn’t say a dirty

. word — while explaining some of Pittsburgh’s

own past (including the recurring theme of Fred
Rogers’ legacy and ananirnated clip of the city’s
role in the founding of America).

Kurlander moves into a diverse array of

vignettes, speaking with equal enthusiasm to
ﬁlm industry associates (Louie Anderson,]enj i
Kohan), childhoodfriends (including the crush
that inspired “St. Elrno’s Fire”) and Pittsburgh
notables (Teresa Heinz Kerry, Paul O’Neill, David
“Mr. McFeely” Newell) about Pittsburgh’s past,
present and future. ‘

The story culminates in meetings of yinzers
in Los Angeles, New York and Pittsburgh itself
to celebrate the city and its people.,Kurlander’s
personal story also comes to an end reaching
somewhat of a peace with his beloved home-
town. '
The ﬁlm presents aninsightful look at Pitts-
burgh and its entertainment. However, the ﬁlm
seems to fall short with several elements that

_ could have made Kurlander’s compelling con-

cept more complete. I’

. Rather than an expanded expose, the ﬁlm
felt like a quick snapshot. Running under an
hour and ahalf, itseemed that some of the most
entertaining parts (Kurlander’s childhood, his
search for ﬁnancing) were cut short to keep
things moving, perhaps sacriﬁcing some of
the parts most interesting to viewers already
familiar with the city.

The ﬁlm’s organization also seemed confus-
ing at times, with the personal and Pittsburgh
narratives not so much coming together as fol-

lowing parallel paths. g V
Thoughstrongoncharmandcertainlysome— A

thing Pittsburgh can be proud of, “My Tale of
Two Cities” stillneeds afew tweaks before it can
be viewed with the attention it deserves.

. MUSIC REVIEW

Benders’ lyrics honest

I Christina Ranalli
For The Pitt News

The Morning Benders
BigEcho

Rough Trade Records
Grade: B-

- Rocks like: Grizzly Bear, Cold War Kids

The Morning Benders went from making
music on laptops in ‘college dorm rooms to
the top of the pop scene —— and its sophomore
album, BigEcho, was the ticket there.

Each song on Big Echo, although beautiful
in entirety, is conﬁdent and safe. .

This album is a mix of style and technique
from different eras and genres. It oozes with

, the band’s various inﬂuences from the psy-

chedelic pop of the ’60s to the new wave of
indie rock.

Although it’s obvious that The Morning
Benders made serious attempts to ﬁnd its
sound, the blurred distinction between the
ending tracks only shows that the band has

yet to discover its ability.

Without the risks, Big Echo still rings with
the diversity of classic modernity and sugary
romanticism for which the band strove.

The Morning Benders’ front man Chris Chu
and Grizzly Bear bassist Chris Taylor partnered
to produce a high—quality, multi-layered album
different from anything else before it. '

It opens with the pure and melancholy l_ove
song,.“Excuses.” The single is introduced by

. a nine—note melting violin solo much like the

one found in Etta James’ “At Last.”
With diverse instrumentation and adoringly

I honest lyrics, the opener is an invitation to the

pure-hearted experience that’s interweaved
through tracks that follow. A

Aside from front man Chu’s smooth, impres-
sive a_nd‘lush vocals, the band’s diversity within
their pop element is what sets it apart.

From the upbeat “Cold War” to the woozily
somber “Pleasure Signs,” there is something
for everyone to enjoy. ‘

Even though there is room for improve-
ment, the album still echoes one big message
—— The Morning Benders are here to stay.

A 1,300-mile trip for the op-

” portunity to be placed in front,

of Jonathan Baldwin in man-to-
man coverage —— it’s_ not exactly
a defensive back’s dream, but for
new Pitt football player Saheed
Imoru, it’s a reality. '

, Imoru, a native of Houston, re-
cently arrived at Pitt after spend-

ing two years at Navarro Junior

College in Corsicana, Texas. Now,

. as spring camp continues, Imoru

is receiving immediate opportu-
nities to sure up Pitt’s defensive
backﬁeld. ,

The cornerback position re-
mains one of the biggest ques-
tion 'marks ‘hanging over" the
Pitt football team as the April’ 17
spring game approaches. With
the graduation ofjovani Chappel
and two—time All—]3ig East player

Aaron Berry, the Panthers need‘
to replace both of their starting-

cornerbacks; L
The urgent need for the cor-
nerback spot is why Pitt targeted

a junior college defensive back.‘
However, Imoru’s signiﬁcance in-'
creased when an injury prevented
senior Ricky Garyfrom partici-
pating in spring practice.

The Texan was immediately
thrown into ﬁrst-team action and
has had the opportunity to test
himself against the Pitt receiv-
ing corps.

“It’s a real good situation. I
just need to make the most of my
opportunity and take advantage
of it every day,” Imoru said after_.
Saturda'y’s scrimmage.

Imoru is no_ stranger to quality
performances. In junior college
he was an all—conference per-
former, amassing 68 tackles, 18
pass breakups and three intercep-
tions his final year at Navarro.-

At the beginning of camp,_his
junior college success transferred
to the Pitt practice field.

“The positive is that every-
thing that we saw him do on tape
at the junior college, he’s done ..
here,” head coach Dave Wannst-

spring practice. l

The Pitt baseball team registered‘

its'20th win on the season against
Akron a day before giving up 19

' runs in a losing effort to Kent State '

earlier this week;
On Tuesday, Pitt won a tight
5-4~game on the road against the

Zips despite resting several start-

ers. . -
“It is a long season, and we
needed to get some players a little
rest and get others some playing
time,” head coach Joe Jordano

said. “I think we had four or ﬁve ~

freshmen play overall and had a

chance to just DH [Joe] Leonard
and rest [Danny] Lopez an [Tra-

vis] Whitrnore.” ’ . _

The Panthers (20-7, 4-2 «Big
East).loaded the bases in the ﬁrst

when left ﬁelder John Schultz

reached on an error, Leonard
singled and ﬁrst baseman David
Chester walked. Catcher Kevan
Smith grounded into a double
play, ending a potential big in-
ning.

_Pitt threatened again in the
third with two runners in scor-
ing positionand only one out, but
Chester popped out and Smith
grounded out to end the inning.

Akron struck ﬁrst with a two-
run homerun by designated hit-

starter Alex Caravella, who went

5.2 innings and gave up three runs

on six hits.

The Panthers quickly answered
with three runs in the sixth in-
ning. Pitt loaded the bases with

no outs when Leonard reached .

on an error, Chester walked and
Smith singled‘. Second baseman
Philip Konieczny then hit a sacri-
ﬁce ﬂy to center, scoring Leonard.
Two batters later, Manny Pahoulis
singled home Chester and Smith
to put Pitt up 3-2. '

Akron re—took the lead in the

bottom of the sixthwhen Hallett .

drove in a run witha double, and

Pitt wins 20th game, then gets

later scored on ya passed ball.

, . The lead changed once again

in the seventh, when Chester
hit a sacriﬁce ﬂy to score center
ﬁelder Zach Duggan, who lead
off the inning with a single, and
Smith singled home Schultz, who
reached on a walk.

The Zips put runners in scoring
position in each of the last three
innings‘, but couldn’t score°oﬂ'
the trio of JR. Leonardi, Corey

Baker and Leonard, each of whom i

istered the win to up his record to

fourth of the season. i I
On Wednesday, the Panthers

the Golden Flashes. Kent State

' scored early and often on its way

to a 19-6 rout.

“Our starter did not performr

options,” Jordano said. “With a

Celebrating  years of Student Journalism

Across the nation, spring practices are rev-.

ving ever so slightly for annual spring scrim-
mages. These festivals of football fandom are
more than just large-scale advertisements
for boosters and season ticket holders.

They’re the ﬁrst ‘look we get at what a team ‘

has to offer for the coming year.

Last week, I took an early glance and
broke down each team in a lengthy preview
of Big East football. This week, it’s time to

_ predict the awards, who will-win them and-

why.

Big East Offensive MVP ,
RB, Noel Devine — West Virginia
Mountaineer fans had to be thrilled when
they found- out the’ junior Devine was re-
turning for one more year at West Virginia
rather than entering the NFL Draft. Make
no mistake, Devine would’ve been drafted,
and early. Y . ' g
. But Devine is back, and poised for a
breakout year for the Mountaineers. He’s
always had the ability to bust out big gains

‘ since his days of splitting carrieswith Steve

Slaton. But-last year, Devine showed he can
be patient as well. He settled for three— and
fourayard gains on his way to a 1,465-yard,
13—touchdown season. Heidid all this, despite
battling a late—season ankle injury.

There’s no question that if Devine stays .

healthy, he’l1 easily amass 1,500 yards this

season. I think with an offensive line return— 0
ing four starters, plus a quality backup in ;

sophomore Ryan Clarke, Devine will have
a huge year. ‘ '

Big East Defensive MVP

DE, Greg Romeus —— Pitt ,

Where else should I go besides re-upping
with Romeus this year? Pitt fans know he’s
a freak athlete: ‘Listed at.6—foot—6 and 270
pounds, he has impossible speed for his size.

It creates huge mismatches for opposing-

offensive tackles. .

"Sure, Pitt lost its two starting defensive
tackles. They were a big reason why Romeus
had eight sacks and 11.5 tackles for loss last
season. But returning is opposite. defensive
endjabaal Sheard. Offensive lines won’t be

able to doub1e—team Romeus for fear of open: ‘

ing up Sheard on the other side.

A guy like Romeus is only going to get I

better. He’s in only hissixth year of playing
football, period. He still is improving even as
ajunior.,Last year was just a taste of what this
talented defensive stud can do. Quarterbacks
better pray he doesn’t wreak absolute havoc
in the Big East this season. "

Big East Coach of the Year

Doug Marrone — Syracuse

Bear with me on this one. Iknow he’s
returning less talent than two teams scrim-
maging on the Cathedral lawn, but Marrone’s
Orange are looking more promising than
they have in a long time.

Their quarterback situation should be

. light—years improved. Former Duke point

guard Greg Paulus was a turnover machine
last season, now the reigns are handed over
to sophomore‘Ryan Nassib. With Marrone
calling the plays this year, as he did when he
coached Drew Brees and the_N_ew Orleans
Saints from 2006-08, the offense should

. improve. Throw in an outstanding lineback-

ing corps inside a decent defense, and this
team could have something to work with
this year. ‘ . ' -

If Syracusecan sweep its nonconference .
' schedule (at Akron,'at Washington, Maine,

‘Boston College) and steal two wins in the Big
East, they’re bowl eligible." That, my friends,
is agood way to earn Coach of the Year. '

, Quick Hits: ' 0. V
If you’ve read my columns in the past, you
knowl also write about Big East baseball. I’ll

digress to that a bit here, because this story -

is just too weird to pass up. The Pittbaseball
team lost 9-8 after a throwing error in the

bottomof the ninth in the opening game of Z

a three—game set against Rutgers on April
1. The two runs on the error capped a ﬁve-
run ninth inning for Rutgers. Pitt coachjoe
Jordano, according to reports from multiple
outlets including the New York Post, left the
dugout to argue a call with the umpires on
the field. As the umpires huddled, Rutgers
men’s basketball coach Fred .Hill_Ir., whose
father Fred Hil_l Sr. is Rutgers’ baseball coach,

-reportedly stood in front of Pitt’s dugout and .
was seen and heard yelling profanities in the A

direction of Jordano andvthe Pitt coaching
.staff; According to‘ NewJerseyNewsroom.

com, Hilljr. was fired yesterday and Rutgers .

has started looking for his replacement. One
candidate, according to that same article, is

. Robert Morris’ Mike.Rice. A bizarre way to

get rid of a coach, but Hill’s career record of‘
47-77 — a .379 winning percentage —— prob-
ably wasn’t doing him any favors in giving

- him job securityeither. '

Mark my words, Tom Savage and Zach
Collaros are going to battle as the top two
quarterbacks in the league this year. Savage
will come out on top.

Remember NFL running back Tyrone
Wheatley? Well, now he’s a coach at Syracuse
and, as this feature describes, he’s passing
along his knowledge to the Orange’s back-
ﬁeld.

doubled. That was Pitt’s last lead of the
game.

Kent State scored 14 runs over the ﬁrst
two innings, including a grand slam in the
ﬁrst by ﬁrst baseman Kyle McMillen, a
grand slam in the second by third base-

man Travis Shaw and four other homeruns, .

including a second by McMillen.

V In the fourth, center ﬁelder Duggan
plated catcher Cory Brownsten with a
single. Several batters later, Schultz came
up to bat with the bases loaded and came
through with a'double, driving in all three
runners. Chester later hit a sacriﬁce ﬂy to
bring Schultz home.

Kent State answered with ﬁve runs of

I its own in the bottom half of the inning,

putting the game out of reach and ending

. the scoring for either team. Starter Kevin
‘Dooley registered the loss for Pitt, which

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Pitt to host Louisville

I drops his record to 1-2.

“We played solid in both games,” said
Jordano. “We were just short pitching today.
We had a solid game against a very good
Akron team, and today we scored six runs,
had 10 hits and played error free. We just
did not have a very strong performance
from our pitching sta .”

Starting today, the Panthers will host
the No. 7—ranked Louisville Cardinals at

Trees Field for a three—game series. The-

game times are set for 3 p.m. Friday, 3 p.m.
Saturday and noonon Sunday. Louisville is
24-4 overall and 5-1 in Big East play. '
“We will be prepared this weekend as we
do each conference weekend,”Jordano said.

‘ “We are who we are and we will play each

game hard, and we will let the results play
out. We look forward to the challenge of
competing against a team in the top 10.”

cooled off a bit, and now. he hopes to battle
through his slump and elevate his game.

“The ﬁrst couple of days I was doing real
good, and then this last week has probably
been my worst week here. And I need to
pick it up a lot,” Imoru said.

Adjusting to defensive coordinator Phil
Bennett’s system and playing with more
emotion are two of the necessary improve-
ments that Imoru noted.

Along with Imoru, junior Antwuan
Reed and redshi_rt junior Buddy Jackson
are competing for time at the cornerback
slots. Reed received a modest amount of
game action last season, while Jackson
is still looking to make an impact in his
college career.

After Saturday’s scrimmage, during
which the offense was performing to maxi-
mum capability, Wannstedt noted that the

defensive backﬁeld is a bit of a work in '
progress.

“Antwuan, Saheed, Buddy Jackson —
they’re all getting better. We have a ways
to go,” Wannstedt said, “They’re inexperi-
enced guys, and new guys and young guys.

We’ve got to just keep coaching them and
keep being positive. They’ve got the abil-.,
ity to play. We’ve just got to get them to
that point-.” '

As for the junior college newcomer,
he’s set his sights on a starting position
for when the ball gets kicked off this fall.
In fact, Imoru, who also had scholarship
offers from Iowa State, New Mexico and
North Texas, would expect to challenge for
a starting role even if last year’s starters
didn’t graduate.

“The situation, with the two corners
leaving, I never took that into account
because I have a lot of confidence in my-
self,” Imoru said. “So whatever school I

~ was going to pick, I was looking to earn a

starting job. Nothing is given, of course,
and wherever you go youfve got to‘ earn
everything you have.” _

At the moment, he’ll have to earn the
coach’s conﬁdence as the competition con-

‘ tinues to heat up through spring camp.

“I don’t know how it’s all going to unfold
at the end, but we’re awful happy that we
have him,” Wannstedt said.
