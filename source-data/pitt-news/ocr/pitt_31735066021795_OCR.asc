MANILA, Philippines — A
60-day truce with Communist
rebels formally expired Sunday
without hope of extension, and
the government said it would step
up military patrols while pursuing

peace talks on a regional level.

A rebel umbrella group urged
its members to ”wage militant
and unremitting struggles on all
fronts.” Some groups have said
they opposed regional talks.

The head of the committee that
monitored compliance with the
cease-fire urged President
Corazon Aquino to intervene to
prevent a civil war.

The truce had paved the way

-for peace talks in January, but the

negotiations were suspended in-
definitely Jan. 30 after the rebels
accused the government of acting
in bad faith.

The government responded by
saying it would not agree to an
extension of the cease—fi re unless
the rebels agreed toresume ”sub-
stantial negotiations” to end the
18-year insurrection.

The rebels said new talks
would be fruitless because the

 

  
 

new constitution, approved last
week, imposed too many limita-
tions on what is negotiable.

Since the talks ended, at least
22 people have died in scattered
clashes. No reports surfaced of
fighting Sunday.

Suburban youths held
for homocide charges

PITTSBURGH — A 16-year-old
boy and two younger girls will
stand trial in the death of an
elderly widow who was robbed,
bound and abandoned for four
days at her home.

Wayne Mialki of suburban Ben
Avon and Tamara Liggins, 14,
and Kristin Rice, 15, residents of
the Holy Family Institute in Ems-
worth, were held for court on
criminal homicide charges in the
death of Marcella Chambers, 91.

Chambers was found lying on
the bathroom floor of her Ben
Avon home on Jan. 18, four days
after she was bound and left there
by intruders. She died Jan. 26
while being hospitalized for se-
vere dehydration.

In addition to criminal homi-
cide, Liggins and Rice face
charges of robbery, burglary, con-
spiracy and reckless endanger-
ment. Mialki faces charges of
robbery, burglary and aggravated
assault.

At the time, Liggins and Rice
were on ”runaway status” from
the Holy Family Institute, accord-
ing to officials there. The institute
is a residential treatment center

Unlikely extension of truce stalls peace talks

However, Senate Armed Serv-
ice Committee Chairman Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., reiterated his warn-
ing that a unilateral reinterpreta-
tion of the treaty by the Reagan
administration would jeopardize
congressional funding of the mis-
sile shield.

Weinberger, in an interview
broadcast by the British Broad-
casting Corp., said the United
States is not yet ready to make a
final decision, but he added that
he has always backed the idea of
a phased deployment starting as

soon as possible. During congres- .

sional hearings last week, he said
the Pentagon was ’’close to being
able to recommend deployment
decisions” to President Reagan.

He told the BBC that, following
the presidential decision, the first
phase of Star Wars, formally
known as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, could be deployed
”-somewhere in the 1993-1994
range.”

lntravenousballoons useful
in curing migraine headaches

By Meg Sachse

For The Pitt News

If mid—term exams and final ex-
ams bring on a migraine
headache, or if you've used the
”not—tonight-I-have—a—headache”
excuse once too often, you are
not alone. It is estimated that 10
percent of the population in the
United States suffers from
migraine headache.

While most headaches are
well-controlled by medication, /at
small percentage are not.

A new approach to the treat-
ment of migraine headaches is
currently being used by Dr.
Joseph Horton, a neuroradiologist
at Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal and associate professor of radi-
ology at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine_.

According to Horton, the treat-
ment involves the placement of
small silicone balloons in the ex-
ternal carotid artery (ECA) in the
neck, which block the normal
flow of blood through the artery.

Among the many theories

about the causes of migraine
headaches are stress, ‘severe psy-
chological problems and diet.

”Migraine is probably some-
thing that can be caused by any
of those things —— and any of
those things probably is able to
set off the trigger — the pain-
causing trigger,” Horton said.

The ECA appears to be the
main source of pain in migraine
headaches, according to Horton.
The ECA supplies the face, scalp
and mouth areas with blood.
Blocking this artery does not in-
terfere with the brain’s major
functions nor does it interfere
with circulation to the face, scalp
and mouth.

”Other sources of blood invari-
ably supply the face and scalp
and mouth,” he explained.’

The ..artery and its .main
-branches constrict at the outset,

but this phase is not painful. A

short time later, the main artery
opens, but its branches may re-

main ’ constricted. Since the

branches are constricted and
there is no place for the blood to

go, the main artery is stretched
with each heartbeat.
Stretching of tissue in the body

causes pain. Stretch-induced pain '

can be even more severe than a
burn injury.

”This arterial stretching is ex-
crutiating  and that is associat-
ed with the throbbing, pounding,
horrible, sick pain of migraine,”
Horton said.

Although there are many con-
ventional methods of treatment,
in most people, medication
seems to be able to control
headaches indefinitely.

”People also try trance, hypno-
sis, biofeedback, acupuncture,
relaxation therapy and diet
modification," he said.‘

Horton stressed that his balloon
therapy technique is not meant
for everyone with migraine
headaches.

’_’AVn_yone with true migraines

it can benefit, but I think lt=';S over- _

kill unless somebody who has
frequent headaches has already

STRESS AND RELAXATION CENTER,

 

Floating not only feels good it is good. Hospital studies reveal floating is successful
treatment for many physical ailments. It stimulates the production of endorphins [the body's
own opiates) while reducing adrenal activity associated with stress and heart disease.
Floating has been successfully used in treating anxiety, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal '
ailments, migrane, and tension headaches, hypertension and chronic pain. It's the natural,
drug-free way to better health.‘ Floating hashad positive results in behavior modification.
Preliminary research indicates floating causes a reduction or elimination of habits such
as smoking, drinking and drug usage. Floating is particularly effective in counteracting
addiction withdrawal symptoms. It can help you through the discomfort of quitting addictive

habits.

Relaxation and health. That's what we offer at Floatation Station. We’ want you to experience
gravity-free floating and all the healthy things it can do for you. '

Mini-grant given to
launch ’Buckle-up!’

By Richard E. Pozzuto

Contributing Editor

More than 43,000 people die
on the nation's highways every
year, and over 3.2 million are in-
jured, according to the U.S Mo-
tor A Vehicle Manufacturers

_ Association.

Ironically, one of youth's most
prized and beloved luxuries --
driving a car — has also turned
out to be the leading cause of
death among young adults.

For people in their late teens
and early 205, car crashes ac-
count for more than 40 percent
of all deaths, thus ranking car ac-

‘ cidents as the leading ”health”

problem among young adults.

In response to the vital need for
appropriate ”vaccination” of the
Pitt community, the Allegheny
County Health Department has
awarded Pitt's Student Health
Service a mini—grant to conduct
seatbelt awareness programs.
Consequently, February has been
officially designated as ”Seatbe|t
Awareness Month” at Pitt.

Several student organizations
have joined with Student Health
Service to form a buckle-up

>>>p>>>>>

l

  

brigade. They include: the Stu-‘J .
dent Health Advisory Board, the-

Drug and Alcohol Responsible
‘Education organization, the Stu-
dent Government Association
and, representing the Greeks, the
Phi Gamma Delta and Zeta Beta
Tau fraternities and the sisters of
Alpha Kappa Alpha.

Some students will deliver pro'- A

grams to student groups and/or
distribute literature, bumper stick-
ers, posters and pledge cards. The

main thrust of the program is to 

get students to sign pledge cards
committing themselves to buck-
le up" for at least two weeks. .4

‘According to Shirley ‘Haber- A

man of the Health Education

Office, the reasoning behind this ‘

is to cajole students to buckle up
at least a dozen times this month.
Hopefully by repeating the
buckle-up behavior many times,

it will be sufficiently reinforced ‘so ’

that it becomes habitual.‘

All students who sign pledge
cards will be eligible to enter a
drawing for prizes, and taken in-
centives will-be offered for those
who pledge at scheduled sites.
The Towers lobby will serve as a
special program site all day Feb.

  Soviets are finally
 making headway

. For the first time since Khrushchev was in office, there are
rumblings of reform in the Soviet Union. All over the world,.
the press is standing up to take notice of the new policies of

A ‘Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev has proposed changes in the policies for appoint-

' ing political officials, going as far as suggesting elections of lower

party officials by secret ballot. He advocated the withdrawl of

' troops from Afganistan. In short, he is trying to move the Soviets
into the 20th century. Then they'll be able to enter the 21st

century. At least that's the plan.
And_ a fine plan it could be. ‘
His major o_pposition is coming from the "old-guard" party

' , members, and some analysts think that they might’ be" lying in

wait until some crisis gives them the opportuinty to move against
Gorbachev, whose power base is assumed to be strong but not
overwhelming. Even after the purges of last year, there remain
high-placed party officials that refuse to endorse the changes
he has proposed.

The Soviet leader reminds us that the changes he is making
should not be viewed as a shift to Western political ideology.

_ . The national party will remain in control.

However, the changes he is making are for a more open
society, they should be supported. Any changes that direc-

.‘tion are changes for the better. ,
The political convictions of the Soviets are vastly different

from ours. In the spectrum of world relations, that is a given.
When we can deal with a country that is honest and open,
although ‘different, we will be much closer toa world that can
live in peace.rWe are different, but should not remain separate.

 Classified ads for
adoption are good

Advertisements are often placed in the classified section of
_ this newspaper by couples who are unable to bear children
on their own. The advertisements offer an alternative to females
suffering an unplanned pregnancy. infertile couples often offer
to pay medical expenses of the pregnant female, etc.,~in ex-
changetfor the right to adopt the child.
This practice has been questioned often, and this newspaper
has been criticized for accepting such advertisement. The Na-

tional Committee for Adoption is even seeking to have indepen-

dent adoptions barred by law.
This would be wrong.
Independent adoptions provide pregnant women opportu-
nities they do not have elsewhere. The biological mother is able
to meet her baby's future parents and find out exactly what they
are like. Through this, the mother can control what type of en-
vironment her baby would be entering. She does not have this
option when the baby isplaced up for adoption through an
agency. ’ ~ .
Additionally, the independent adoption works to the advan-
tage of the future parents. They are able to sidestep the usual

\ .

, red tape they would find if they were attempting to adopt

through an agency. The time spentwaiting for a child is-con-
siderably less. , _ . A
Independent adoptions, are good. _

’_ There are some things I'm won-
dering about. Maybe someone
can help me o_ut.

I was reading the newspaper,
and some real disturbing things
caught my eye. The world at

, large seems to be getting stranger,
and no one’s doing anything

about it. To quote Bret Easton EI-
lis, there's a weird wind blowing.

Think about it.

There's a guy from the church
in Lebanon, playing cowboy to
negotiate the release of some
hostages, and everyone get’s all
upset. about him being taken
hostage. What did they expect,
that the nice" men in turbans

V would fix them dinner and talk

over cocktails? Sounds like a lot
of foresight to me.

The Soviets freed some politi-
cal prisoners and then wouldn't

_’ let them Ieave"the country.
What's the point? if

Marcos was exposed as "a
crook, wasn't he? I thought em-
bezzling a country into poverty to
buy shoes was usually frowned
on by the people of the country.
Now those people, dirt poor so

some lady can buy silver pumps,
are fighting to get him back. Are
they tired of the Aquino fashion
scene? .

Did anyone ever see the
Twilight Zone? I thought so.

We're selling guns to the Irani-
ans, ‘we're giving money to the
lraquis, we're giving some money
to the Contras sotthey can pro-
mote demockracy(sic). Now,
some people in the government
knew about the whole thing and
shouldn't have, and there were
some other people who didn't
‘know but should have. Except»
there are some other people who
say that the people who should
have, did, and they're sayingthey
didn't because they wanted to

cover up for some people who _

knew but didn't want anybody
else to know they did. Yeah,
-right; Government of the people,
by the people... ‘ .

There's aweird wind 

We have a huge deficit. Real-
ly. There's a law that says our big

deficit isillegal. They want to .

pass an amendment that tells the
government that they have to
have a balanced budget. That'|I
come as a suprise.

What are we going to do now,

. say that since the deficit is illegal,

it shouldn't be allowed to exist in
the federal computers? You
know, there -are laws against the

. government harboring criminals.

With the deficit safely expelled
from the files, it wouldn't be a

problem any more. It's gone.‘

Three cheers for the legislators. Is
this really happening?
I saw a story about a 5-year-old

boy who. was ”sodomized”_

while the’ mother and grand-

« mother looked on. The mother's
_boyfriends, that's right plural,

raped the kid. Why is that there?
Why is our "need to know" so

strong that we must tear into the ,
life of a boy, 5, that’ 5 been raped? '

The weird wind isn't always
pretty, it doesn't always smell like
flowers.

Allocations manual clear T

A5 Allocations Chairperson, ‘I

I need to set the record straight in

.regard‘to the misinformation con-
tained in the Pitt News editorial
[in the Feb. 4 issue of The Pitt
News] concerning the SGB Allo-
cationsprocess and to correct the
impressions created by the deri-
sive editorial cartoon. The Pitt
News mistakenly places the
blame for the ignorance of the al-
locations process on the liaisons
and not on the officers of the stu-
dent organizations where the
blame more properly lies. Just as
ignorance of the law is no
defense, ignorance of the alloca-
tions guidelines, is likewise, no
excuse for violating the policy
and procedures. ,
Although it is the responsibili-
ty of organizations to be aware of
the SGB, guidelines for funding,
the Allocations Committee does
its best to inform the student lead-
ers of the process. In December,

up the 1987 Allocations Manual.‘
In- January, ads were placed in

The Pitt News reminding organi-
zations that the manuals were
available, and that they were ex-
pected to attend one of two busi-
ness managers’ meetings which

were held on January 12 and 13.

The allocations liaisons have
published office hours and have
attempted to contact their as-
signed groups to offer assistance
with their budgets. Clearly, this is
more than an adequate attempt
by the. committee to encourage
the individual groups to learn our
policies and procedures as pre-
cisely defined in the Allocations

To keep the process running as
efficiently as possible, the groups
are infornred that their liasion will
provide an explanation of the rec-
comendation of the Allocations
Committee prior to the SGB ap-
peal, but that the_group must in-
itiate contact. [...].

As for the editorial cartoon,

suffice it to say, the Allocations’

Committee‘ does not monkey
around: The liaisons are a valua-
ble source of information and ac-
tually solicit the groups to take
advantage of their assistance. Un-
fortunately, many groups choose

to ignore their help. The commit- .

tee will do its best to make the
1987 budgeting process as effi-
cientand fair as possible; we only
ask that all the student leaders do

THE PITT NEWS, lMonday, February 9, 1987   

Last week, PBS aired a
documentary about the English
language. It discussed various di-
alects of English -— black English,
Cajun English, Hispanic English,
etc. -— and proceeded to argue
that these dialects are legitimate
variations of the English language
and that mainstream America
should not look down on these
dialects or the people who speak
them. The program" seemed to
imply that these dialects should
be recognized and that speakers
of them should have the right to
use them whenever and where-
ever they choose.

America is a strange country.
We're strange because our popu-
lation doesn't share a common
nationality or race. People from
all over the world live here in
relative peace. Even though we're
all very different, we do share a

‘ common identity. We're Ameri-

cans first and German, Jewish,
Thai, Black and Italian second.
We appreciate our respective an-
cestries, but, at the same time, we
embrace the American culture.

‘One of the main reasons- that
the United States is so unified is
that we share a common lan-
guage. It's called standard En-
glish. Granted, no one speaks it
all of the time, but we do speak
it when we have to. For the times
when we're not speaking the
standard,. we switch back to our
respective dialects. Everyone has
at least one, and most people
have many. Dialects are directly
related to a person's experiences
and upbringing.

A For example, I speak upper-
middle class, ‘eastern Pennsylva-
nia, fallen-‘away Catholic,
21-year-old college student En-
glish. My cousins from Pittsburgh
don't understand me when I talk
about yonies and Holsteins. Non-
Catholic friends don't understand
me when I talk about confirma-
tion names and transubstantia—

ANATER

tion. My mother draws a
complete blank when I tell her
how great it is to be legal or that
I'm bumming because I bagged
a class that day.

I know a person who speaks

' mindless, pop-culture jive, the

result of too many hours spent in
the wasteland of top-forty count-
downs. He tells me about a pair
of bitchin’ Jams he just bought
and I wonder why'he’s so exited
about pyjamas. He claims that
they will allow him to "Walk Like
An Egyptian” in style. I'm very
confused. I ask him if "He Be
Illin’ ".

What would everyone think if
Ronald Reagangave a speech in
ex-actor, ex-governer of Califor-
nia, neo—Orwellian, upperclass,
76 year-old English? He would be
laughed out of Washington in the
same manner Jimmy "Hi Y'all”
Carter was in 1980. I'm sure Rea-
gan would like to talk to the peo-
ple in this country in the manner
in which he feels most comforta-
ble, but sometimes comfort has to
be sacrificed for clarity. His use
of Standard English guarentees
that everyone who hears him will
understand him. »

The point I'm trying to make is
that no two people speak exact-
ly the same dialect of English.
Does anyone or any group have
the right to say one dialect is
more legitimate than the next?

There are movements under-
way to begin to teach black Eng-
lish in predominantly black
schools. How are the students
invloved ever supposed to func-
tion and prosper if they can't
speak or understand standard
English? I

 

Why is it only black English
that merits instruction in schools?

In my home town, most people
are Mennonites. Those who
aren't Mennonite are Amish.
These people speak an almost in-
comprehensible dialect of En-
glish, and they make up the

‘majority of speakers in northern

Lancaster County. But I don't
hear them demanding that the
students at Ephrata High School
be taught classes in their particu-
alar dialect.

Everyone from the deep South
to New ‘England learns to speak
standard English in school. That
education allows them to under-
stand the evening news, to write
business letters, to read the
newspaper and to fully function
in our society. Our common lan-
guage is what brings the citizens
of the United States together.

Our society is becoming in-
creasingly fragmented already. In
1987, one really doesn't need to
speak English to get by. He can
take his driver's license exam in
the language of his choice. De-
pending on the area of the coun-
try in which he lives, he can buy
foreign language editions of
major newspapers. His children
can go to a public school and be
instructed in their native tongue.

It may seem that we're becom-
ing more tolerant and that we're
not as racist as we once were. It
smells like progress — but it's not
progress, it's deterioration. In ord-
er to preserve our now faltering

unity, our society must return to '
standard English. A first step,-

would be to make English the
official .language of the United
States. Another step would be to
stop permitting non-standard di-
alects and languages to be used
in official communications. Steps
such as thesemay inconvenience
individuals, but they will contri-
bute to a more unified United
States of America. ’

Kids aregrowing up fast

I saw something this weekend

‘ " that angered me. And after I

thought about it a little more, it
scared me. '

A stroller-bound little girl was
wearing a set of headphones and
in her small hands she was con-
trolling the cassette player. The
girl couldn't have been more
than two or three, and she
seemed oblivious to the fact that
her mother was even there push-
ing her along.

For someone this age, I con-
sider this a form of sensory depri-
vation. Little girls shouldn't be so
passive at such a young age. They
should be listening to the world
— exploring, touching, thinking
and interacting. Her mother prob-
ably bought her one of those
"Teddy Ruxpin" baby-sitter bears
for Christmas.

In a most frighteningly carica-
tured way, she resembled a
young adult.

But what I saw that day didn't
end there. Another girl who
couldn't have been more than
nine years old was wearing more
makeup than most women do.
Her coiffure certainly put mine to
shame, and her clothes were so
vogue, I almost wanted to ask her
where she got them. ~

But I didn't. Instead, I asked a
friend who was with me at the

FRANCES
SANSIG

time whether she was just a short,
provocative 16-year-old or a
nine-year-old. I honestlycould
not tell. When I heard her voice,
I knew.

We know children have always
wanted to grow up too fast, and
parents used to have the sense
not to let them to.

I am beginning to doubt
whether that is true anymore.

Children‘ have always wanted
the same privileges as adults and
now, more than ever, they seem
to be willing to‘accept a certain
amount of .responsibility that
comes with them. We seem to be
saying, "|t’s OK to achieve like
us, dress like us and want to
make money like us," but we
don't want them to have sex like
us. The trouble is, they are.

According to an "Intelligence
Report” in a February issue of Pa-
rade magazine, 29 percent of stu-
dents enrolled in a middle school
—‘—- those are students between the
ages of 11 and 13 — in Califor-
nia said they were sexually ac-
tive. Almost 30 percent. That's
about three out of 10.

I find this alarming, but I guess
I shouldn't. The report also said
for middle-school boys (boys, not
men), 11.1 was the average age
for losing one’s virginity. For girls,
it was 11.7.

Whether the results of the sur-
vey conducted at this particular
high school reflected a national
trend was questioned, but they
cannot be that far—fetched.

When I was 11, I was still play-
ing with Barbie dolls. I wasn't al-
lowed to goto a school dance
until I was in the ninth grade, and
I wasn't allowed to date until I
was 16. Have things changed that
much? I'm only 20 years old, and
I feel like I'm 50.

I only hope that these same
parents who are encouraging
their children to grow up so‘ fast
and to achieve so soon are also
the same ones ‘who are support-
ing sex education and counseling
in the public school system.

Otherwise, as a result of the
decline in age of initial sexual ac-
tivity and the pressure we are
placing on our youth to grow up
too soon, we may be contribut-
ing to the production of a gener-
ation of children who will have
children who have no idea who
they are because their parents are
too young to understand and ex-
plain to them.

have been an ardent Dolly Parton _ -_ . _
fan for just about as long as I can-remember. The first time I
heard her sing, I could hardly believe it. She had one.of the
sweetest, clearest voices I had ever encountered. Listening to
that voice could break your heart.

When I initially heard Dolly sing, she was the partner of a
Country vocalist named Porter Wagoner. Dolly definitely got -
second billing; they sang duets, but Wagoner was the star.

Though  it didn't matter that she wasn't supposed to be the
main draw. She was so special. At the time, Wagoner and Par-
ton had a syndicated television show that was seen mostly on
small UHF stations. Dolly even did commercials on the show;
if I remember correctly, she sang the praises of_ laundry de-
tergent. -

Ithought that she was my secret. I went to extreme measures
to prove my loyalty to her. For a brief time, whenever I booked
an airplane flight, I would call the various airlines first and
choose whichever one was featuring Dolly's song "Jolene" on
their in—flight tapes.

Something funny happened, though. One day Dolly was sort
of a cult favorite —— a singer with a small but devoted following.

And the next day it seemed that the whole country was mak-
ing jokes about Dolly's breasts. I'm not sure, but I think it start-
ed on Johnny Carson's TV show. I remember Johnny making
some sly double-entendres about Dolly's bustline and the au-
dience roaring.

Dolly Parton's breasts — or, more precisely, thefact that peo-

into a mainstream’ personality. All those years she had been sing-_ I .
ing in that haunting, lovely voice — and what it took to make. f "
her a_star was tabunch of snickering gags about her chest. ,

Dolly played along with it. She appeared on talk shows and
joined in the kidding. Soon enough, in offices all over the coun-
try, Dolly Parton jokes were in vogue. If someone by the water ‘
cooler made a reference to Dolly Parton, you knew that he was
referring to large breasts. ’

So Dolly became a star. She made movies and went from the
country music charts to the top of the main charts. Some said
that she was the most powerful woman in show business.

What had happened was that Dolly had become a cartoon.
Wiser commentators have pointed out that, in~American popu-
lar culture today, you need to be a cartoon character in order '
to succeed- Complex,'low-keyed people don't catch on with
the public. It seems that the public is only willing to embrace
those performers who are, indeed, human cartoon characters.
The list is long: Mr. T, Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Hulk Hogan, -
William "the Refrigerator" Perry — you can probably add on

the talent that matters. What matters is that the public must be
able to peg a performer. in a fraction of a second. It's easier to
do that with cartoon characters.

I have no idea what would have happened to Dolly if the
nation had not decided to make her bustline the object of its
folly. Maybe she'd still be on the UHF stations playing second
fiddle to Porter Wagoner; maybe she'd still be selling detergent.

I'm still a fan. I'm still in awe of her voice. If you've never
heard Dolly Parton sing "I Will Always Love You," do yourself
a favor. Buy’one of her albums, and forget every Dolly Parton
joke you've ever heard. Just put the record on the turntable,
close your eyes and ponder the question of why talent alone
is somehow_ never enough.

”That’s illegal; you're buying

babies,” said Sheetz. ”[However]

couples will pay it.’They want ba-
bies so bad.”

According to Sheetz, a couple
has to wait two years to get on the
waiting list of the Family Infertil-
ity and Adoption Center. ”Place-
ment would take one year; that's
short.” said Sheetz.”lt usually

takes five years to adopt a baby.”

. It was reported in the National
Law Journal that the National
Committee for Adoption is seek-
ing a total ban on independant
adoptions. They represent more
than 130 private and public
agencies.

Lucille Rosenstock takes a ‘

much different view of private
adoption. Rosenstock is an attor-
ney in New York who specializes
in arranging adoptions. Ms.
Rosenstock advises her clients to
place ads in newspapers to
search for a pregnant mother. She
claimed that these ads are very
succesful in placing children with
loving parents.

Although Rosenstock declined
to say how many adoptions she

I has arranged, the National Law

ranges 125 adoptions annaualy.

Freshman Orientation

Nothing could have prepared me
for the ﬁrst few moments with my
roommate. ‘Anique”———nothing more,
just ‘iAnique”-—-was her name. Change

' the “A” to a“U”and you’Ve got a

description.

When they asked what type of

roommate I wanted,

I didn’t know that

I needed to be more speciﬁc than non-
smoker. I could swear I saw a picture
of Anique on a postcard I got from
London. Within ﬁve minutes, I found
out that she was an Art History stu-
dent, into the Psychedelic Furs, and
totally, totally against the domesti-
cation of animals.
 I was just about ready to put in
 for a room transfer when she
 reached into her leather
backpack, pulled out a
can of Suisse Mocha and

offered me a

cup. Okay, I .

decided I’d keep an open mind.
As we sipped our cups, I
found out that Anique and I shar
the same fondness for Cary Grant '
movies, the same disdain for wine

Feedback
positive
on five
year plan

By Natalie Wilson

For The Pitt News

Officals of Pitt's School of Edu-
cation reported that student feed-
back on the school's new
five-year program has been posi-
tive, though students are con-
fused‘ about the changes.

An informational meeting was
held last week for anyone seek-
ing information about the pro-

‘K

gram and format of the school's 1*"

‘ departments, and_ undergraduate,

graduate and certificate programs
were discussed. Tours of the
departments and the opportuni-
ty to speak with members of the
departments were also available
to students and faculty.

”Most of the feedback I have
gotten personally has been very
positive,” said David Plank,
chairperson of the Administration
and Policy Studies Department.
”Students are supportive, [but
they] are a bit puzzled by the .
changes going on around them.”

Plank said the students realize
the reorganization will enhance
the ”academic pro- grams of the
department.” Speaking for his
department, he said, ”We are
bringing together people who
have not previously -worked to-
gether, and [we are] strengthen-
ing the preparation we offer our
students.”

Stephen Koziol, chairperson of

‘the Instruction and Learning

Department, said the program is
a great idea, but some students
are confused over theyentire situ-
ation. He said he believes that
student awareness of course offer-
ingshas risen." '

According _to Koziol, the con-
cept of the reorganization is good
and the ”unity is healthy.” He
also said he is pleased with the
new opportunity for students and
faculty.

Janet Gibson, chairperson of
the Psychology in Education
Department, said the students
from whom she received re-
sponses are pleased with the
change. She also said she likes
the opportunity forinteraction be-
tween faculty and students.

THE pm News, ‘Monday, February 9, 1937

By Wendy Wisniewski
For The Pitt News

The actual experience a physi-
ci_an aquires as a resident is just

‘ as important as his basic educa-

tion, according to Dr. Paul Paris,
director of Pitt's unique residen-
cy program that specializes in
emergency medicine.

Paris said the three—year-

residency program originated in
1981 under ”a co—operative ven-
ture” between Mercy Hospital,
Presybyterian—University Hospital
and Western Pennsylvania
Hospital.

In the program, residents learn

P However, Noel did not have

numbers ‘just for the four—year,

programs Bennett mentioned to
Congress. Noel also said Bennett

may have been thinking of‘

another educational research

office study — this one ‘showing .

that there were 1.9 million first-
time college enrollees in 1,980
and about half that many
bachelor's degrees awarded four
years later. ‘

The ratio backs up Bennett's
completion rate, but not his
growing concern because it has
been virtually the same for 30
years. ’’I’m astonished,” Noel

. said when told this.

Educators like to cite another
educational research office study,

H to dealwith any type of injury

that can happen to the human
‘ body, including auto accidents,
gun wounds and even psychotic
behavior. ”My goal is to train
graduates to handle any life
threatening illness,” said Paris.
As of last year, academically,

the program was considered the \

best in the nation, according to

standardized tests administered

to residents . A
According to Paris, the resi-

dents learn by being exposed to ‘

emergency situations. Second-
and third—year residents.drive a

and another.27 percent in five. -

The rest took six to 11.5 years to
earn their degrees.

”Very often it relates to finan-
cial needs. The aid they're getting
is simply not enough,” said Bob
Hochstein, spokesman for the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching. “And
with middle-class students, it has

to do with having some other en—.

riching experience like traveling
or volunteer work.”

The old model of going to col‘-
lege straight out of high school
and finishing four years later is
—”essentially dead when it comes
to looking at the reality of cam-
puses today,” Hochstein said.

specialized equipment most am-
bulances do not have.

”This is the only program in the
countrywith such a vechicle,”
said Paris. He added that this is
significant because it will set the
standards for other emergency
medical facilities hoping to ac-
quire such a vehicle.‘

Other duties for residents in-
clude the ‘staffing of large local
events. For example, four resi-
dents attend each football game
at Pitt stadium. Last year, they
saved three people experiencing
cardiac arrest during games.

Another important part of the
program is research. Residents
must successfully complete a
research project and write a
paper pertaining to it.

”The program is one of the two
most prolific in research,” said
Paris. ”Residents have submitted
15 different projects this year to
the ' University Association for
Emergency Medicine..” '

But according to Paris, the core
of the program is the experience
the residents gain working in the

- emergency room. Residents'cir-

culate and treat patients in the
emergency rooms of Mercy
Hospital, Presbyterian-‘University
Hospital and Western Pennsylva-
nia Hospital. »

”Eighty—two million people
visited emergency rooms last
year,” said Paris. It is through this
direct contact that Paris said he
hopes his residents will learn to
be ‘both ”kind _and co_mpas-
sionate.” ‘

Paris said he gains ”personal
satisfaction in improving medical
care both regionally and global-

Hot tub diplomacy

By Steve Wilstein
Associated Press Writer

BIG SUR, Calif. — For eight
years, Esalen Institute’s ”hot-tub
diplomacy” has been quietly tak-
ing some of the chill off U.S.-
Soviet relations.

There's more involved than
officials from Moscow and
Washington plunging into warm
baths overlooking the Pacific,
although few are inclined to en-
mity in such soothing sur-
roundings.

The eclectic home of the,

”human-potential movement” for
25 years, Esalen is in the forefront
of a blossoming grassroots effort
by thousands of ”citizen diplo-
mats” in the United States to im-
prove relations with the Soviet
Union, .
”Behind the whole dream
here,” said" Esalen founder
Michael Murphy, ”is (the belief
that) if we can stimulate other
groups to do this and broaden the
whole front of cultural and scien-
tific exchange and trade, there's
less and less reason to fight each
other, in spite of the differences
in our two cultures.’’ ’
Far from the formality of attend-
ing summitry and arms talks, the
gatherings at Esalen, midway be-
tween Los Angeles and San Fran-

cisco, are as laid back,
California-style, as possible.

Officials, writers, health experts
and others taking part in Esalen’s
Soviet-American Exchange Pro-
gram can talk freely while stroll-
ing the 100 acresiof exquisite
gardens, lawns, farmland and
forests.

They share a large house above
the sea and meet for hours
stretched out on pillows in a
room with a tiled fireplace or out-
side with the ocean crashing
against rocks below.

And, of course, they enjoy the
traditional Esalen massages and
communal baths fed by a hot sul-
fur spring. .

”The Soviets love it,” said Jim
Garrison, director of the ex-
change program. ”About 30 have
come here so far, including a
number of high-level diplomats
and scientists.”

The Soviets seem to concur.
”We believe people-to-people
contacts can contribute to the
normalization of Soviet-American
relations and to soften the over-
all climate in the world,” said
Sergei Aivazian, vice consul at
the Soviet consulate in San
Francisco. _

Esalen once attracted such
thinkers as psychologists Abra-
ham Maslow, Rollo May, Carl

used in U .S. —   Soviet talks /

Rogers and B.F. Skinner, body
therapist Ida Rolf, writers Aldous
Huxley, Ken Kesey and Carlos
Castaneda, Zen Buddhist Alan
Watts and theologians Paul Til-
lichand Harvey Cox.

It gained fame in the 1960s as
much for the lively workshops of
Gestalt therapy founder Frederick
5. ’’Fritz’’ Perls and encounter
group guru William Schutz as it
did for the musicians it attracted:
Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Crosby,
Stills and Nash, Simon and
Garfunkel, and Beatles George
Harrison and Ringo Starr. .

”The '60s were a period of
tremendous excitement for a lot
of people, and Esalen was very
much inthat spirit of explosive
enthusiasm,” Murphy said.
”There’s been a tempering of lots
of claims. Some of the methods
we've simply dropped while
others have been developed. Esa-
len has been an experiment.”

Esalen remains a vibrant cam--

pus onthe vanguard of psycho-
logical, physical and spiritual
exploration.

More than 5,000 guests a year
attend 500 weekend and 5-day
seminars with such titles as
”Do‘orways of Perception,”
”Reflections of Self: A Reichian-
Gestalt Primer,” ”lnside-Living

House finds CIA lackadaisical

By Jim Dlrinkard

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Despite a
flurry of serious spy cases in re-
cent years, the U.S. intelligence
apparatus is almostlackadaisical
about guarding the nation's most
sensitive secrets, according to a
new congressional assessment.

The House Intelligence Com-

' mittee, in terms far harsher than

those used by its Senate counter-
part in a similar report last year,
found ”a litany of disaster”‘and
called for major overhauls reach-
ing deep into the counterspy
bureaucracy.

”Our hope is that the criticisms
will be taken as drawing attention
to something that needs to be im-
proved,” said Rep. Louis Stokes,
D-Ohio, the new chairman of the
committee. ”We hope the execu-

-tive branch will clean up its act.”

Among the panel's findings
were:

0 Carelessness in hiring for sen-
sitive intelligenceposts. For ex-
ample, the CIA hired Edward
Howard, who seriously damaged
the agency's operations in
Moscow by giving secrets to the
Soviets, despite ”an extensive his-
tory of using hard drugs."

0 Failure to take seriously the
implications of the arrests of 27
U.S. citizens for spying from
1984 to 1986.

0 A relaxation of strictures that
should govern the most highly
information. ”There
seems to be a widespread attitude
within some U.S. intelligence
agencies that once an employee
has been granted a Top Secret
clearance  strict adherence to
the ‘need-to—know’ principle is
not required,” thepanel said.

4  Relativelyiugindiscriminate is- 

suance of security clearances. Of
200,000 applications {for Top
Secret status in 1984, only 1 per-
cent were denied. Currently more
than 5 million Americans hold
some level of security clearance.
”The chances of a few spies hav-
ing received clearances among so
many are high,” the report states.

”The committee does not be-
lieve that the U.S. intelligence
community can go ahead on a
business-as-usual~ basis in the
wake of these espionage dis-
asters,” said the report issued last
week, which was the result of a
series of hearings and interviews
last year. ‘ _

While the report details many
of the same shortcomings cited
by the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee four months ago, its tone
is far more pessimistic, citing a
”disturbing lack.of judgment,”
”staggering, long-term damage to
national security” and ”serious
management failure”‘in various
intelligence areas.

In November, President Rea-
gan began implementing a series

in protecting nation's secrets

of counterintelligence defenses

that stemmed from a long study ‘

by the National Security Council
staff. The changes included sta-

' tioning Pentagon investigators in-

side large defense plants,
increased spending on communi-
cations security and improve-

ments in handling of defectors. '

And the Senate report, while
pointing out areas where im-

' provement was needed, conclud-

ed; ”As a result of significant
improvements in recent years,
the nation's counterintelligence
structure is fundamentally
sound.”

But Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-lnd.,

who was chairman of the House . 5:;

panel while it was conducting the
study, said the improvements are
not enough. '

”The reaction of the intelli-
gence community to the spy
cases was very inadequate,”
Hamilton said. ”Our report took

‘ into consideration those steps,

and we think they are not
sufficient.”

The focus of the Soviet-

1 Wage increase legislati

  

 

By John Cunniff

Business Analyst

NEW YORK —' The minimum
wage‘ of $3.35 an hour hasn't
been raised since 1981, and that
was the result of legislation 10
years ago that provided for five
consecutive yearly increases.

Proposals to raise the rate,
therefore, are considered ripe for
action this. year, because living
costs have risen nearly 20 percent
since 1981. That means some
ripe old arguments will be
polished and sent into the fray
again.

At one extreme is the conten-

tion that a job paying the mini-

The other refrain is that such
jobs are for beginners, for
trainees, for youngsters — that
they are jobs to be graduated
from rather than made life
careers. To raise wages, it is said,

would eliminate jobs and oppor- -

tunities. A

those supporting an increase, the
Chamber of Commerce among
opponents. It is an issue typical-

grades, very athletic, slim and pretty. ’

ANALYSIS

mired in emotion rather than clar-
ified by reason.

But, while the old arguments
probably willdominate again this
year, a big new element must be
considered. This element is the
shrinkage of production jobs and
the proliferation of unskilled serv-
ice and "retailing positions. 1

In the past, business contend-
ed that a low minimum wage was
required in order to support the
transfer of skills to previously un-
skilled workers through the ap-

said they could not afford to pay-

any but the barest of wages until
beginners became productive.

— But, they argued, having learned

skills, such workers then were
prepared for much higher
earnings.

Today, however, many of the
lowest-paying jobs do not involve
the learning of skills. Instead, the
worker is taught an efficient rou-
tine that, in effect, makes him or
her part of an automated system.

there were 14.2 million manufac-

only 13.1 million by June 1986.
In 1980, according to the Eco-
nomic Report of the President,
there were 17.9 million service
workers; in 1985, almost 22
million.

The rise of service jobs is just
one aspect of the picture. The
other is that service jobs tend to
pay less than production jobs. In
1985, the average weekly in-
come of full and part-time wor-
kers in service industries was
$147.49. Government figures
show that in goods-producing in-
dustries it was $232.18.

THE PITI' NEWS

By Sam Tallarico
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's and women's
track teams were both successful
this weekend as they rolled over
Marshall University. The men
won by a score of 90-49, while
the women won 65-53.’.

Pitt, which placed in 15 of 16
events, was without the" services
of All-Americans Lee McRae and

Eric Cannon, who were compet-
ing in the Dallas Morning News
Indoor Games in Texas.

There is, however, more to Pitt
track than just two men.

”We have a lot of good athletes
— very credible runners on the
team — and I was pleased with

_their performance,” said Pitt

men's track coach John Vasvary.
Givingcredit where credit is
due, here are team members who

came away with top honors: Paul
Friedrich, 2-mile run (9:12.2); Joe
Turner, 880-yard run (1 154.5);
Vernon Reed, 50-yard dash (5.4);
Bernard McCoy, 300-meter dash
(35.2); Joe Daniels, 1000-yard
run (2:O6.5); Chop Burton,
500-meters (1:O6.8); Bob Wein-
er, 1-mile’ run (4210); Dave Price
and Tim Manes, 440-meter dash
(49.6); John Murray, 50-yard high

3/4); the 1-mile relay team (Nor-
ris Coleman, T.J. Brookover, Cor-
nell Brown, Tim Manes: 3:25.5)
and Tim Washington, triple
jump.

Even though Pitt had strong
performances, the team wasn't
healthy, and‘ some people ran in
events they were not accustomed
to.

Bloomsburgahands wrestlers second league loss of year   

Pitt was able to take two of the ? ‘
last five matches, with Eric Wertz. '

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer ‘

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
was defeated 29-15 by Blooms-
burg University last Friday night.

The loss dropped_the Panthers -
to 9-2 overall and 1-2 in the
Eastern Wrestling League.

”We wrestled well but just
couldn't pull it out,” said Pitt
coach Rande Stottlemyer.

”Almost every match was close,
so our guys never gave up. The
meet showed how good Blooms-
burg really is; after all, they are
ranked seventh [in the country]/’

The meet started off well for Pitt
as Matt Rizzo won 11-6, but
Bloomsburg took the lead when

Pitt's Matt Gerhard was pinned. .

”Rizzo_did a real nice job,” said
Stottlemyer. ’’He really wrestled

well from start to finish. Matt“

[Gerhard], on the other hand, was
in a fog as soon as he walked
onto the mat..You can't do that
and hope to win.”

Pitt's Pat Santoro was able to

the week to help the Panthers tie .

the match with a technical fall.

the meet, Stottlemyer had said
that this would -be the pivotal

match. Unfortunetly for Pitt,

they never relinquished.

’’I thought that 126 and 150

 Lady Panthers lose,  
78-50, at Syracuse

 

By’ Matt" O'Hara
Staff Writer

The Syracuse Orangewomen
beat the Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team 78-50 in Syracuse
Saturday afternoon, the Lady Pan-
thers playing without regular
point guard Valerie Halesworth.

Halesworth said she didn't
make the Syracuse trip because
she has been suspended from the
team. Lady Panther head coach
Kirk Bruce said Halesworth’s fu-
ture would be resolved today af-
ter he talks to her.

Karen Threatt, a freshman from
Jersey City, N.J., started in
Halesworth’s place. She scored
.two points and had two assists,
but she also had six turnovers in
18 minutes of playing time.

The loss dropped Pitt to 5-17
overall, 0-12 in Big East play,
while Syracuse improved its
records to 12-10 and 8-3.

”We played right there with
them in the first half, but we had
our typical second-half

problems,” said Bruce. ”They put
together a run in the second half
and outscored us 14-3 —- that was
the turning point.”

Junior forward Sally Sheerer led
the Lady Panthers with 18 points
and eight rebounds, while fresh-
man guard Jen Shingler added 13
points.

The Orangewomen, who have
defeated Pitt twice this season,
were led by guard Sue Ludwig
with 20 points, three assists and
five steals. ' -

Pitt will attempt to break its
14-game Big East losing streak,
which dates back to last season,
when it hosts Boston College at
Fitzgerald Field House Wednes-
day at 5:30 p.m.

Bruce, for one, isn't giving up
hope. ”We’re not going to quit.
We have a good group of girls
that have been working hard, try-
ing to build momentum going
into tournament time. It's just a
matter of time before we turn
things around,” he said.

the point guard spot.

There was even a walk-on,
Willie Kelly, who contributed
off the bench.

If there was a pivotal p.oint
in the season for that team,
Bruce said, it was during a
tournament at Arkansas. Pitt
defeated Connecticut, then a
national power, in the opening
round 83-63. It followed with
_a 91-83 win over Arkansas for
the tournament champion-
ship. I

”I just remember thinking
that we are on a roll,’’ Bruce
said. I

Which is how this year's Pitt
squad has to be feeling. Four
of the six victories in the cur-
rent win streak have come on
the road. Perhaps the biggest
was a 14-point Carrier Dome
win over the same Syracuse
team the Panthers host tonight
in the Civic Arena at 7:30 p.m.

Syracuse and Pitt are tied for
first place in the Big East with
8-2 records.

A Pitt loss, which is a
definite possiblility, will drop
the Panthers into second place
and provide a huge character
test for a team which in the
past has shown little or no
character through adversity.

Last season, after a crucial,
nationally televised, one-point
loss to St. John's at Fitzgerald
Field House, the Panthers lost
eight of their final 10 games.

A collapse like last year
would be disastrous.

A Pitt win, barring injury or
something of the like, could
virtually secure a first ever Big
East crown for the Panthers.

It would raise their recordto
9-2 in the conference, with the
schedule favoring the Pan-
thers. On the slate that re-
mains, Pitt virtually has two
guaranteed wins against
Boston College and Connec-
ticut. It also has a more than
solid shot in a home game
against Villanova on Feb. 23.

The only question marks are ,

away games at Georgetown
and St. John's.

Syracuse, meanwhile, hosts
Providence and Georgetown,
but also must travel to Villano-

va and St. John's — no guaran-
teed victories. Additionally,
the Orangemen have a non-
conference game against
defending national champion
Louisville this coming Satur-
day at the Carrier Dome.

The conference standings
are crucial, but tonight's game
means even more than that.
For several years, signs have
popped up during Pitt basket-
ball games at Fitzgerald Field
House, claiming ”Pitt has ar-
rived” among the basketball
elite in the nation. In the past,
that has been wishful thinking,
but a win tonight —— broadcast
nationwide during prime time
by ESPN — could turn it into
reality.

A loss — in the eyes of many
— means this is the same old
Pitt Panthers.

As Bruce phrased it: ”Our
men are leading the league,
and we have beaten every-
body. We beat Syracuse at
Syracuse, and to beat Syracuse
at home — to me — would
make a big statement to the
rest of the league  and to the
rest of the country.”

Pitt arrives tonight  maybe.

P°tt

Continued from page 11
defense against Syracuse, which
allowed offensive powerhouses
Jerome Lane and Charles Smith to
reach peak forms in scoring and
rebounding — much like what
happened Saturday against the
Friars.

”They totally physically over-
powered us,” said Providence
head coach Rick Pitino. ”They
got us the worst from the inside.
Our plan was to try and get in to
attack their inside, which is real-
Iy the only way you have a
chance at beating Pitt. But to no
avail — they wouldn't give us any
room whatsoever.”

The scoring game was a free-
for-all, but Pitt was able to hold
an average lead of five points
throughout. Friars Billy Donovan,
David Kipfer, and Ernie ”Pop”
Lewis, who usually are‘ big shoot-
ers for their team, were met
almost point-by-point by the
mountainous talents of the Pan-
thers. At one point in the second
half, Charles Smith, who had a
tremendous scoring game with
25 points and 17 rebounds, swat-
ted the ball from Donovan as he
was attempting a three point shot
after he had just stolen it from
Curtis Aiken.

”What we all got to see out
there were great basketball play-
ers,” said Donovan. ”They over-
powered us and really kept us off

the boards. When I was making
the three-point shots near the
half, I thought we might still have
a chance. But near the end of the
game, I just started shooting out
of desperation.”

The Panthers started the game
with a layup by Curtis Aiken,
who totaled eight points and five
rebounds. From there on, things
seemed to go downhill for the
team. In fact, at many points the
Friars’ defense seemed as if they
were confused whether the game
they were playing was basketball
or volleyball as they kept swatting
at rebounds.

”It really was just like playing
volleyball,” said Jerome Lane,
who padded his NCAA-leading
13 rebounds per game average
by adding 17 more and scoring

20 points as well. ”What welhadg

to do was just capitalize on their
weaknesses and shove them’ out
of the way. They tried to play us
hard, but they couldn't. Even

though some of us made some-

‘dumb mistakes, we were still bet-
ter than them.”

One of the main factors which
bothered Pitino the most was the
consistent rising and falling of the
point lead. During the second
half, the Panthers were up by 12
and then dropped to five and
then went back up again.

”This really was not a good
game for someone with blood

 

pressure problems,” said Pitino.
”As the Pitt leads kept going up
and down, so did my adrenaline,
and I know it was the same with
Evans.

”One thing that must be
remembered is that Pitt is so well
coached that it is a professional
rebounding team,” Pitino con-
tinued. ”Their offense is simplis-
tic, but their defense is strong and
they remind me a lot of the Lak-
ers. One thing is for sure, Syra-
cuse better not take its game
against them Monday lightly —
Pitt is too talented a team to do
that, and they're difficult to beat
because they don't beat them-
selves.” '

Chambersstars for Westteam,  

wins MVP in NBA All-Stargame~A

By Bill Barnard
Basketball Writer

SEATTLE — Tom Chambers
won Most Valuable Player
honors with 34 points and Rolan-
do Blackman hit two pressure
free throws at the end of regula-
tion as the West beat the East
154-149 Sunday in the highest
scoring all-star game in NBA
history. _

Blackman had 29 points for the
West, which had lost the previ-
ous three overtime games in, the

.37-year history of the game.

Blackman scored four points in
overtime, includingthe opening

basket that gave the West the lead '
to stay at 142-140, as the West,

won for only the second time in

,1 eight games. Chambers had four

points in the overtime for the
West, which still trails in the ser-
ies 24-13. . - '
The East's 154-145 overtime
victory in 1984 at Denver was the
previoushighest scoring game.

_ The West's 154 points tied the’

1984 total for themost points by
one team.

Blackman, who scored 10
points in the fourth quarter, hit
two free throws with no time left
in regulation toforce the
overtime. I

Freehlingg

By Kelly Witt

, For The Pitt News

”My mother made me do it!”
says Pitt freshman gymnast Brock
Freehling about-his start in gym-
nastics. ”I wanted to play
basketball.” _

As it turns out, with Freehling
standing only 5-6, it's probably a
good thing he listened to his
mother. ' J

An all-around gymnast, Freeh-
ling had been providing a lot of
help to the Panther’s winning ef-
forts until he suffered a sprained
ankle two weeks ago in practice.

It was the third sprain to that
same ankle for Freehling, and the
injury put him on crutches for a
few days.

Freehling is anxious to get back
in action, though. ’’Hopefully by
the Michigan State meet [Febru-
ary 21 at Pitt] in two weeks, I'll
be able to compete in every-
thing,’.’ said Freehling

Freehling, however, did go
with the team to Kent State this
past weekend.

Talented in all events, Freeh-

ling says the floor is probably

what he's best at, but he really

doesn't have a favorite event.
In Pitt's defeat of Eastern Michi-

gan in January, FreehIing’s

Moses Malone had given the

I East a 140-138 lead with three

seconds left on a tip—in of a
missed shot by Kevin McHaIe.

The East seemingly had a safe
lead at 128-116 with 5:40 left,
but the West rallied as Chambers
scored 10 points in 3:07 to'cut
the deficit to 136-135 with.\2:O1
remaining. Chambers had 14
points in the fourth period.

Malone led the East with 27
points and 18 rebounds, andghe
also helped the East foul out West
starting center Akeem Olajuwon,
who went to the bench in the first
minute of overtime to become
the first all-star since 1978 to be
‘called for sixpersonal fouls and
only the second since 1971 _to
foul out.

James Worthy had 22 points for.

the West and Julius Erving 22 for
the East in the 16th and final all-
star game of his professional
career. He played in five Ameri-
can iB'aske'tbaII Association ‘All-
Star games before moving to the
NBA for 11 more, all as a starter.

Erving put himself into position
as a possible MVP when he
scored nine points in a four-
minute span of the third quarter,
keying a 42-point period that
almost carried the East to victory.

The West started the second

lad tobe Pitt gymnast 

highest scores came from the
floor exercise and the vault, scor-
ing 8.85 on each.'»But-at the

‘Shenandoah Valley Invitational

(January 31.)_ he was injured and
only. competed on the paralell
bars and the high bar as Pitt won
the meet over the other four com-
peting teams. -
In high school Freehling was
on the gymnastics team until the
program was cancelled when he
was in ninth grade. He then went

I to train at Jewart’s Gymnastics

Club near his home in Leech-
burg,‘ Pa. He got interested in Pitt
because friends from- Jewart’s
came here and he knew the gym-
nastics program was good.
Freehling contacted Pitt coach.
Frank D’Amico, who then be-
came interested in him.
Freehling doesn't have much
time between gymnastics and
classes. During the summer he
goes back to Jewart’s and teaches
gymnastics to kids. After graduat-
ing from Pitt, he hopes to con-

tinue teaching gymnastics. _
Before the gymnastics program

in his high school was cancelled,
Freehling lettered twice in gym-
nastics. He also lettered in track
and in diving. In the 1985-1986
PIAA State gymnastics champion.-
ships, he captured second place.

Eady gymnasts win three Over weekend  

Yesterday the Lady Panthers
traveled to Kent State University
for a tri—meet with Kent State and
Cornell ‘University.

Pitt easily took the meet with a
177.65, while Kent State placed
second with a 172.05. Cornell
placed third scoring a 169.6.

The low score did not do
justice to the Lady Panthers who
made it through the meet without
having to count a fall on any
event

Making a clean sweep of the
all-around awards for Pitt were
Sleith, 35.45, followed closely by
Spector,35.35, and Waters,
35.15.

Aser took first place on floor
with a 9.4. The judges could only
find .4 worth of deductions with
Aser’s routine, which showed
both exceptional dance and tum-
bling. Teammate Waters placed
third with a 9.05. '

Juniors ‘Cathy Coleman and
Teresa Garcia tied for first place
on the uneven bars with a 9.15
and Waters took third place with
a 9.05. I

Sleith placed first on. the
balance beam with a 9.05 and
Junior Kim Calderone place third
with a 8.85.

”Some of our weaker routines
scored higher and some of our
stronger routines did not,’.’ added
Yohman. ”But Louie and I are
very excited. Right now we're
stuck at 177 but I'm sure we'll get
rewarded soon.”

were the high scorers on the high
bar.

The Panthers were pleased,
and somewhat surprised, at their‘
success inthe meet. ”We went in
therenot expected to win,’.’ said.
Pollaci. ”Kent State had consis-
tently scored higher than we
[did].” Tarosky added, ”More im-
portant than winning was the
team spirit throughout the meet.
We would have been proud even
if we would have lost. We gave
the best effort we could. Every-
one hit clean. There were prati-
cally no mistakes. What really
helped was the way everyone,
was cheering for each other."

Powanda said, ”Everyone did
their job. We matched Kent State
score for score on most of the
events. This was a unified team
effort — the way we fought for ev-
ery 10th of a point.”

The Panthers next meet is Feb.

”We didn't want people run-
ning sick, so we decided not to
run. I didn't think Marshall had
a team anyhow,” said Manes,

who was scheduled to run the

2-mile relay but at the last minute
was switched to the the 1-mile
relay. '

”The coach asked me if I could
run the mile relay. It's good to see
I can run two races back—to—
back,” said Manes. ”We have the

‘ Big East [Championship] in two

_ weeks."

Another interesting aspect of
this race was Vasvary utilizing
some of Pitt's young talent be-

’ cause other performers were ill.

”The younger guys picked up

the slack. It was a nice team per-
formance. The younger athletes
got a chance to step in and show
themselves,” added Vasvary.

I The women's victory was not
as decisive as the men's, but,
nonetheless, it was still impres-
sive. That is, of course, if scoring
means anything. ,

”We performed well, but our
‘primary [objective is]  improv-
ing individual performance,” said
Pitt women’s head coach Steve
Lewis.’ ”We want to find out what

‘direction we should take in the
next few weeks.” "

Senior Lori Wood won the
2—mile with 11:56.8. Other win-
ners included: Kristin Laskowski,
880-yard run (2:23.3);’ Vanessa

Jones, 300-meter run (43.3); Deb-

bie Bonner, 50-yard dash (5.9);

Robin Hubauer, 1000-yard run
(2:49.1); Pat Cupid and Luanne
Harris, 50-yard high hurdles (7.1);
Gloria Azeke, 500—meters
(1:14.4); andthe 1—mile relay
team (4:OO.5).

”We wan_t to improve on things
we have to do, so we'll do our
best in competition,” Lewis
added.

Men's swim team still undefeated,

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer "

The Pitt men's swim team
capped off their dual-meet season
in a winning way this past
weekend, beating both Cleveland
State and Kenyon at Trees Pool.

The Panthers didn't expect a
challenge in the meet against
Cleveland State on Friday, and
they didn't get one, winning easi-
ly 118-86.

Although the win was easily _

achieved, the Panthers generally
felt they were not swimming-up
to par. .

”We didn't feel as if we had
swum well against Cleveland
State,” said Pitt juniorlim Emore.
“We felt as if we swam hard but

our times just weren't down .

' there. We just didn't feel very
comfortable in the water for some
reason.” '

State the next day was probably ,

in the back of the Panthers’ minds
at the Cleveland meet.

The meet against Kenyon was
an important one, especially for
the seniors. An undefeated sea-
son record was resting on the
meet.

The Panthers were looking for
good competition from the
Kenyon team, which coming into
the meet, held the fastest times of
all of Pitt's opponents this season.

It was also a significant meet for
the seniors because it was the last
home dual meet of their Pitt
swimming careers.

The Panthers could not have
asked for a better ending to their
dual-meet season, beating

Freshman Tim Adams, sopho-
more Mark Dombroski, Emore
and sophomore Scottlefferies got
the Panthers swim team off to a
good start winning the first event
of the Kenyon meet, the
200—medley relay. . —

The team followed through
winning six of the next seven
events. Emore posted the most
wins of the day taking first place
in the 100-yard butterfly and
backstroke, as well as being a

I've come to Pitt. They provided
strong leadership and a good ex-

Shaulinski felt a great deal of

"At the beginning of the season
I would have predicted us going
6-3,” said Shaulinski. "This team
worked harder than any other

Lady swimmers end
season on down note

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's swim
team couldn't finish off their

dual—meet season on a positive ~

note. They were defeated
yesterday 172-96 by Brown
University in Providence, R.|.

Pitt women's swim coach
David Belowich was disap-
pointed with the loss but did

not express disappointment-

about the team's‘ 9-3 season.

''I think we've been a little
bit ‘spoiled these past two
years by having two excep-
tional undefeated seasons
back-to-back," said.Belowi,Ch.
"The team is talented and
worked hard. lregard them
highly."

Freshman Sandy Albright
had another good meet, win-
ning the 100- and 200-yard
backstrokes. ~

Pitt's diving team had a real
work out against Brown. Pitt
junior Cathy McDonald dove
exceptionally well capturing a
first—place finish in the 1-meter
diving competition.

Although the Panthers may
be a little disappointed with
their-loss against Brown, they
are not _discouraged about
how they will fare at the Big
East Championships.

"Even. though losing ,1 the
meet was a downer, it's noth-
ing we can't come back from.
We'll do well at the Big East
Championships," said Bel-
owich.
