On Black Studies Chair

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar, in
a twophour meeting Friday with
black students, faculty members,
and community leaders, promised
to review and pass judgment‘ by
November ‘1 on the decision made
last week to appoint Roland Smith

chairman of the black studies

department.

Smith’s appointment, announced
by FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg,
sparked a protest last Tuesday in
the Chancellor’s small reception
office by more than 100 black
students who advocate instead the
naming of Curtiss Porter, an assis-
tant professor of Black Studies who
helped begin the department in
1969." .

111 response, Posvar, who was in
New York at the time, agreed to
meet with a delegation of the
in a Schenley Hall
conference room to receive more

'information and listen to concerns,

and finally to make a final deter-

Sternglass in Debate

mination before Friday, when
Smith is scheduled to assume
duties. 3

The mood of the meeting Friday
was calm, in contrast to the tense

_confrontation early last week, with

about 30 persons surrounding a

conference table where Posvar sat -

listening to six representatives of
the movement to have Porter
named chairman.

The black leaders constantly criti-
cized the administrative process--

‘ particularly where it concerned the

actions of Rosenberg--and called
upon Posvar to evaluate it.

"We are trying to tell you that the
process is the problem." said
Norman Johnson, the chairman of
the search committee which had
previously recommended Porter
and Smith,
Porter, for the job.

“The process got aborted on your
side, Mr. Chancellor,“he added.
“We want you to rule on the
process,.and not on Curtiss Porter

vs. Roland Smith. And when you
judge the process, and find it to be
faulty, you can only conclude that
the result was also faulty."
Without being specific, Posvar

admitted the process may have_

been faulty and that he had “heard

some bad things about it.”
However, ‘he did not express

reservations about Rosenberg, who

New Radiation Theories Aired

' BY CONNIE GIEL

Dr. Ernest J. .Sternglass, profes-
sor of Radiology at Pitt, has
revealed startling new develop-
ments concerning the effects of
radiation on human beings which
drastically revise his theory of
genetic damage.

Sternglass, once the center of
national attention with his publica-
tion of material supposedly deter-
mining the cause and effect
relationship of nuclear fallout and
subsequent genetic modifications,
said during a public debate last
Friday the new data provides
support for certain aspects of his
theories but renders obsolete

studies that linked radiation

exposure to chromosomal damage.

Speaking before nearly two dozen
students at Pitt's Thaw Hall,
Sternglass used the debate forum
to present the new data and defend
his long-held views. His opponent.
Dick Adkins from Westinghouse
Advanced Reactors Division at
Waltz Mill, referred to Sternglass
as “the most refuted man in
history."

“Before, we regarded radiation as
primarily affecting the genes; now
we stress somatic rather than

‘‘ genetic.,effects,’’ Sternglass said.

    

 

“We now ' know,‘ that we have ».
».o‘ver~1ooked one of. =t-he_ most

ryg.

  

important mechanisms by which
radiation acts on a cell. The first
one, familiar to all, is the direct
action, like a bullet, of an alpha or
beta particle tearing through a
cell's DNA.

The second action, known but not

fully understood until recently, is
the indirect production of a
chemical which diffuses over to the
critical components of a cell, such
as a membrane.”

Relating the discovery of the
second mechanism to radiation
exposure studies, Sternglass said

all past tests had been done at high
doses of radiation, which were
assumed to be the most damaging
to the body. “But the low dose
mechanism is different in that the
lower and more spread out the
dose, the easier it is to break a cell
membrane," -Sternglass said.

Faculty Extends Support   ii

For‘ Rosenberg Decision 

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

CAS faculty gave solid support to
FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg’s
decision to name Roland Smith as
black studies department chairman
at the fall FAS meeting Saturday
morning. '

Resolutions supporting -the dean, _

and calling on him to remain firm
against “current or outstanding
pressures” were submitted by
physics department chairman Dr.
Philip Stehle and assistant profes-

‘ sor of Black Studies and political

science Emmanuel Anise.

Anise’s resolution addressed it-
self to claims of non-participation
and lack of input made by involved
students following the disclosure of
Rosenberg’s decision October 21:

“We endorse the position (a) that
while students should have recog-

nized input into the process leading _

to such an appointment, such
student participation should take
place within the orderly procedures
set forth _and approved‘ by
Departmental as well as Univ'ersity
governance; (b) that we are
satisﬁed that the faculty, students
and community were duly repres-
ented on the Search Committee
that recommended three names to
the Dean, and, therefore, that the
students’ claims of non-participa-
tion in the year-long process is
incorrect and misleading; and (c)
that students do not have any
rights to unilaterally determine the
appointment of a Departmental
Chairperson.”

The resolution, which termed a
reversal of the decision “a serious
and undesirable attack on the
integrity and moral authority of the
Faculty, the Dean and the
University Administration,” -was
passed by an overwhelming voice
vote, with two’ or three negative
votes out of about 100 faculty
voters attending.

  Senate Hopefuls

Flaherty, Schweiker--

BY KEN GORMLEY

Pete Flaherty walked into the
Greentree Marriot lnn last Sunday,
a little late getting back from the
Steeler game. Holding his daugh-
ter. Maggie, by the hand, the
Senatorial-hopeful grinned for the
flashing cameras and went into the
hall where a wine and cheese party
was being held in his honor. Pete
worked his way around the room,

Imak7ing'-*‘sure he shook hands and V

exchanged banalities with every
one of his several hundred guests;
friends, fellow Democrats, rela-
tives, and even a few Republicans.
He had a genuine smile of his face,
shook every hand with genuine
warmth. '

When he was called up to the
mike, Pittsburgh’s mayor strolled
to the corner, smiled, and said “Hi,
everybody. How’s it going?’i’~After

hands, greeting his friends with
pats on the back, and introducing
his wife and children to the many
supporters.

The people loved him, loved how
he didn’t look ’ or act like a
politician. It was evident in the

the radiation affecting children yet
to be conceived. “Essentially it is a
developmental thing we have
found," he explained.

Questioned about the dangers of
medical x-rays,. Sternglass an-
swered, “They are given at
tremendously high rates, that’s
why people aren't droppingoff like
flies from being x-rayed. If they
were given at low doses, it would
be deadly.” ' ,

Adkins, a former employee at the
Knolls Atomic Power Lab in New
York, remarked, ‘,jAll this talk
about ‘deadly’ makes me assume
that if 1 drank a bottle of Jack
Daniels right there in the state
store, it would be more ‘deadly’
than if 1 drank it a shot at a time
over a long period of time.“

Accusing Sternglass of making
several‘ crucial omissions in his
pt‘esentati()i1 of the data,- Adkins

noted geographical inconsistencies -

which failed to support Sternglass‘
material. Sternglass dismissed the
charge as inconsequential, and
made accusations of his own.

Asked why Rosenberg never per-

to why he would not be appointed
to head the black ‘studies depart‘-

object of much criticism directed at
Rosenberg--Posvar replied:

“I think that if he hasn’t done so,
Rosenberg certainly should have.”

But Posvar defended Rosenberg’s
silence which occurred. when Ro-

1 Ultimate blow

BY THOMAS WASELESKI

'. And now there is no hope for
America. Senator Edward Kenne-
-Idy, in his refusal to seek the
.;Presidency, has dealt the United
.'States the ultimate blow.

v b After betrayal of the people by a
:_leader who sought only to
jimmortalize his own marble bust
and after the consequent campaign
to excuse rather than hold to
account those men of the law who
had made such foolishness of ‘the
law, Senator Kennedy has chosen
,,to shirk the thankless role of good
_-iisamaritan and abandon a languish-
. ing America by the roadside.
.g.Throughout the master-planned
Tstrategies of Waterga.-c there was
V, one pleasant expectation that
-aconsoled the minds of millions. and
. that was Kennedy and 1976. Like a
ijship-wrecked crew spotting a
“lifeboat on the horizon, we knew he
‘. was coming. We only had to ride
}.out the time. But now we discover
»'he’s not coming,-the lifeboat is
“turning back. I

 Far be it from any of us to
question, let alone condemn, Sen.
_eKennedy~'s final, irrevocable decis-
.v “ion not to run as President in 1976.
None of us will ever be called upon
to contend with the fear and
tragedy with which the Kcnnedys
are destined to live. Therefore,
none of us are in a position to
commence with the casting of
stones simply because the last of
' the Kennedy brothers has opted to
fremain in the Senate-, at least for
(the, time being. Nevertheless, let

 Questions Remain

At long last it seems the Student Union Annex will resume operations
after‘ nearly a month of controversy during which the Oakland
Development Inc. (ODI), a two block committee of Oakland residents,
laimed the Annex was a source of the community’s crime problems.
Surprisingly, representatives of ODI agreed last week to a set of
3  for the Annex’s use, formulated by the Student Government
‘7B_oard (SGB). Those guidelines, according to SG representatives are
 on the part of students to accommodate the complaints of
 residents. And the cormnunity representatives have concluded the
 will eliminate the objectionable “unruly crow .”

But, a series of questions relative to the closing of the Armex for
vrnusical events remains unanswered.
9 eliminate the unruly crowds to which the Oakland residents objected?
tWhy have Oakland residents, not yet called upon the Flaherty
administration and city council for added police protection to curb
 in Oaldand? Why does an occupancy permit which the city
izclairned did not allow concerts, now permit the same musicalevents of
_gt_he type that have been regularly held at the Annex since its opening
‘ last January? lfthe occupancy permit was invalid one month ago, why,
ow, can Student Government Programming once again schedule
‘mini-concerts and coffeehouses at the Annex? And furthermore, why
.15 ODI invested with the authority to interpret the occupancy permits of
 businesses within their two block jurisdiction?

' ODI has indeed called attention to their complaint that the University
‘is infringing on the community, and that the Annex, one of these
so-called infringements, created a serious crime problem for Oakland
 residents. But, as we have said before, the Annex is not the sole cause
}_.Zof-the Oakland crime problem. And yet the guidelines agreed to by
‘ODI and Student Government recommend no measures which would in
 mount a full scale offensive against crime in Oakland. _
 City police will not be stationed outside the building, but
and student marshalls will be stationed within the
— Annex. However, only city policy lutve jurisdiction on Oakland streets.
 police protection will not be guaranteed by this agreement,
 it’s anybody’s guess how the many people who are not afﬁliated
 Pitt will he kept from the Annex area.

“ The source of complaints, then, of the Oakland residents relative to
5 the closing of the Student Union Annex have not been eliminated. The
same events will be held at the Annex. No means of controlling the
I activity outside the Annex has been stipulated. And this leads us to
»- wonder, exactly what has been going on in the last month and what,
really, was ODI trying to accomplish with their actions.

How will the guidelines

stuff of which heroes are made.

If Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had
chosen his family over his people,
the Soviet Union would still have_
been manufacturing alibies con-
cerning the countless instances of
arbitrary torture and execution
inﬂicted upon innocent masses in
its fifty-seven year history.

If Solzhenitsyn had convinced
himself to start writing children's
books rather than write the
treasonous chapters of The Gulag
Archipelago, his people would
never have known for sure that
what they had long suspected of
their government was terribly true.
And if Solzhenitsyn had chosen an
easy, complacent life over the risk
of seizure and inevitable death, he
would have been giving the nod,
like so many millions of apathetic
human beings, to any further
oppression that the Soviets might
wish to carry out, stopping at who
knows where.

And so we find in 1974 two men
from opposite poles of the earth,
both confronted with grave circum-
stances, both cornered into making
a final decision, and both indispen-
sable in the talent and service he
can perform. Wouldn't you know
it'd be our man who'd back down?

How can the factors in the
decisions be so similar and the final
outcomes be so different? Kennedy
and Solzhenitsyn both have famil-
ies undoubtedly dear to them.
Kennedy has grieved through the
political murders of two brothers
and several family health-related

 tragedies, the latest being his son’s

 

US Senate race T

Expanding Human Freedom 

BY CHRISTINA ADACHI
Americans today find themselves
in the worst economic squeeze in
decades: skyrocketing prices, ris-
ing unemployment, cutbacks in

social services. This country flies

men to the moon, but it can’t
provide low-cost gasoline for us to
drive ‘across town. .It builds
skyscrapers, but not decent hous-
ing for the poor. lt has the
resources to feed the entire world,
but millions of people are starving.

Neither Gerald Ford, nor his
economic advisors of either the
Democratic or Republican parties,
are able to explain the reason for
the current economic crisis - nor
are they able to provide fundamen-
tal solutions. They are unable to do
so because all of these men tire tied
to the preservation of the capitalist

system, and it is that very system I

which is at fault.

The entire system functions to
uphold the proﬁts of the wealthy
few above everything else. It is the
drive for proﬁts which creates
artificial shortages of meat and
gasoline, and it is the drive for
profits which has produced the
so-called “energy crisis." While
the buying power of the ‘average
worker's paycheck has been
drastically reduced, corporate pro-
fits are at an all-time high.

There has been much talk about
“equality of sacriﬁce" in the“‘f1ght
against inflation." yet, it is
working people who have ‘had to
pay the_price for the current crisis.
From 1972 to 1973, total corporate
profits rose from $98.0 billion to

bout with bone cancer. Solzhenit-

syn has spent eight years in a"

Soviet concentration camp and five
years in exile from his native
province because of a political
crime that was later revoked for
lack of proof. _

Kennedy had to consider the risk
of any number, of fanatics, each
intent on achieving history by
making it a clean sweep of the
Kennedy brothers;
had to be aware that his publication
of Gulag? would be an act of high
treason under Soviet law, punisha-
ble by death.

When each man found himself
confronted with the somber sport of
gambling with the high stakes of
one’s own life, Solzhenitsyn put up
the chips, but Kennedy turned in
his hand. To the astonishment of
the world, Solzhenitsyn was ban-
ished rather than liquid-ated. What

,would have been Kennedy’s fate
we will never know.

What we do know is that America
has been failed not once, but twice
in this very year. First, Richard
Nixon failed us by his self-seeking
manipulation, and second, Edward
Kennedy failed us by his declara-
tion of passivity. We've been
abandoned to a government of
mediocre actors. But can they rule,
you ask. Sure, anyone can rule with

the backing of the American
military.

But can they lead? That's the
crucial question. Unfortunately,

they can‘t, and a leader the stature
of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn is not

available to us. We lament the fact F

that Ted Kennedy was all we had.»

Solzhenitsyn -

$126.5 billion. Yet from 1972 to
1974, the average weekly earnings
of a worker, measured in 1967
dollars, fell from $96.40 to $91.72.

For particularly exploited sectors
of the population, such as Black
people and working women, the toll
has been much greater. College
students, who have to scrape and
borrow money in order to continue
their education, know the meaning
of inﬂation -- as do the millions of
young people who would like a
college education but cannot afford
to pay for one.

Ford’s latest proposals, from
“WlN"- buttons to “voluntary"
wage restraints, are part of a giant
hoax designed to perpetuate the
attack on our standard of living.
The 5% ‘tax surcharge will be an
additionaL burden for “middle
income families and individuals.
The same tax on corporate profits
amounts to a multi-million dollar
giveaway for big business, since it
is more than offset by the tax
rebate which Ford offers for the
re-investment of those profits. In
addition, those corporations which
through loopholes avoid paying any
income tax (and there are many
which do so) will face no added
burden since 5% of nothing is still
nothing.

At the same time, the industrial-
istsvare waging an all-out attack on
pollution control and plant safety
standards. The chairman of the
Ford Motor Company, for example,
is demanding a ﬁve-year freeze on
pollution and safety regulations.
Protecting the health and safety of
workers‘ is not profitable, and profit
is’ the name of the game.

The government is beginning to
admit that the real reason for
inflation has been the huge deficits
in the federal budget. Since 1965,
the government has spent $102.9
billion more than it has taken in.
This inﬂationary deficit went to pay
for the Vietnam’ war and the
Pentagon’s worldwide military
machine. Yet budget cuts are being
proposed in the pitiful amounts
spent for human needs -- Social
Security, welfare, schools, veterans
benefits, medical research.

What is being mapped out is an
attack from all sides on the living
standards of working people." To

This is the second in a series of
articles on the issues in the race for
the US Senate currently held by
Republican Richard Schweiker.

Young Republicans have been

keep capitalism alive, the execu-
tives, bankers and capitalist
politicians are willing to see the
majority of the world’s population
ground down into the dirt.

The Socialist Workers Party
believes working people bear no.
responsibility for the impendin
crisis and have no reason t
sacrifice for it. Our election
campaign platform calls for escala-
tor clauses to protect, not only
wages, but Social Security, pen-
sions and welfare as well.

We stand for jobs for all through a
reduction of the work week with not
cut in pay. We are for massive ~
spending on education, health,
housing an_d other social services
coupled with complete elimination
of the $100-billion military budget. . K
We stand for a 100% tax on all —- 
corporate profits, and no tax
whatsoever on incomes ‘below
$15,000.

The Socialist Workers Campaign

/and the Young Socialist Alliance

are for socialism, where the basic

‘means ‘of production would be

owned by the entire society.
Humanity possesses'the technolo- __
gyf to eliminate all scarcity and
misery. Working people already W
produce all the wealth of this
country.

Under socialism, the economic
decisions that are now anarchic,
unplanned, and dictated by private
profits, would be made democrati-
cally by the vast majority of people:‘
what to produce, where to invest,
what to build. Through rational,
democratic planning, a socialist
society would provide an abun-
dance of the world’s goods for all
and thus open the way‘ to the
greatest expansion -of human _.
freedom in history.

Rosenberg added that the Chan-
cellor, after his meeting with
leaders of the Black Action Society
(BAS) Friday agreed to make a
statement within a few days.

The ‘meeting, which was to
include four agenda items, includ-
ing faculty discussions of the
relative roles of liberal and career
education in CAS; the procedures
and criteria for promotion, reap-
pointment, and coiiferral of tenure;
and grading procedures, was

Q? limited to the reports of the deans,
»~.«v--—. due to the extensiveness of
Rosenberg’s report.

The faculty» voted to defer
discussion of these issues to
another meeting, to be scheduled
for a weekday in the near future.
There was also wide support for the
idea of separating the deans’
reports and free discussion of

 

issues at future FAS meetings.

Rosenberg reported. the appoint-
ment of Jack Daniel to CAS
associate dean and Marcia ‘Landy
and Virginia Elliott to assistant
deans. He also mentioned the
probability of a merger of the
physics and astronomy depart-
ments.

“In the past year, we have
seen the creation of a new
undergraduate degree in computer
science,_’ ’ said Rosenberg. “There
is also the possibility of a degree in
linguistics soon.” . '

Rosenberg detailed a number of
appointments to chairmanships of
various departments which have
taken place over the past year, and
emphasized. a new source of
funding.

“We have received the largest
single. FAS grant since the Mellon
endowment. I’m very proud to
announce a grant of $200,000 from
the National Endowment of Hum-
anities to help the comparative

literature program)’.

Rosenberg produced a,series of
charts illustrating enrollment
trends, tenure decisions and
faculty hiring. He emphasized that
in contrast to the downward trend
of freshman admission, the number
of advanced standing students
admitted has increased.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall spoke
brieﬂy of the appoint/mentof the
new CAS associate and assistant
deans and their signiﬁcance. He
introduced the idea of a separate
meeting to initiate a full faculty
discussion to ‘hopefully lead to a
cohesive faculty philosophy re-
garding issues such as tenure and_
promotion. Marshall also spoke of
the inadequacy of certain Univer-
sity structures. -

“I see greater needs now, in
terms of skill development than in
the past. The system we have is
designed to ignore those needs.”

Upgraded by University,

BY GARY LAMPENFELD

The University is in the process '

of upgrading ﬁre safety in the
Quadrangle dormitories, according
to Health, Safety and Parking
Director Joseph Gil.

Plans call for clearing storage
areas of combustible materials,
pressurizing the stairwells, "and
expanding the ﬁre alarm system to
include campus police on ﬁre calls.
Gil said the expansion of the alarm
system is currently underway.

Gil said the fire hazard in the quad
dorms is due to the ﬂammability of
materials stored in them, such as
mattresses and linens, rather than
the construction of the buildings
themselves.

i Regarding materials constituting

a ﬁre hazard,he said, “Those that
we were able to identify are in the
process of being cleaned up.”

Each of the 500 miniature soldiers
on the playing field represented 25
to 33 men that engaged in the
historical battle of Waterloo.

The soldiers maneuvered on a 16 x
18 foot table where one inch was
equal to 30 yards on the historical
battlefield. The playing table also
included many other details from
the original battlefield. Trees," ele-
vation con-tours. buildings, roads,

mock battle historically accurate.

The rules governing the execution .
of play are detailed and lengthy. .

t’,s a trip” is the way one
sychology student describes his
erience as an undergraduate
gjeaching fellow. Other recipients
the fellowship describe it in
gmilar terms. In fact, it’s difficult
;to.; find anyone involved in the
rogram who can say anything
egative about it.
Twelve undergraduate teaching
llowships are offered each term
;--students in the College of Arts
and Sciences. The awards are
worth $500 each and give an
-‘interested undergraduate the op-
,1!0l'tllnity to experience,the univer-
gsity. from a different perspective:
-‘The real purpose of these
ndergraduate fellowships,” CAS
Dean Robert Marshall explains, “is
to improve teaching.” Dean
Marshall claims that aside from
benefiting the student ﬁnancially
and stimulating academic and

graduate assistant also inﬂuences
he faculty member.

_ ‘The student fellow often causes
the teacher to re-think his/her
ieourse design and plan it from new
_ ngles.
“'1.-“The program however, doesn't
make teaching any easier for
-faculty members, Marshall states,
_“‘in fact, it makes it harder. It
takes more time when two people
have to agree on plans and they're
not executed in isolation.” ‘
The undergraduate teaching fel-
lows’ agree the ‘program takes a lot

spent weekly in preparation vary
from ten all the way to twenty-five.,
Scott MacLeod, a teaching fellow
under English assistant professor
Lee Gutkind in-a course on writing
New Non-Journalism. (English
Writing 134) claims that aside from
teaching one hour a week, he also
reads the class’s papers and
comments on them.

But his responsibilities extend to
outside of class also. On a recent
trip to Cook’s Forest “to learn
something about the people
there,” MacLeod made the arr-
angements in ” advance and the
instructor claims such an excursion
would have been impossible
without the teaching fellow.

A teaching fellow according to
Gutkind, can help “to break down
the barriers between teacher and
student.” Although he confirms
that it’s harder having a teaching
assistant, “it’s also more fun.”

Gutkind and MacLeod worked
closely in preparing the proposal
submitted to the Dean and in
designing the course. Both agree
that it’s working out well for
themselves and for the students
involved in the course, citing" the
progress they already ’see in
student writing. Students in the
course also feel positive about the
set-up, one of them remarking.
“lt's like getting two teachers for
the price of one."

But not all teaching fellows teach.
Marc Valen, a senior with a
psychology major, is a teaching
assistant for Psychological Statis-

tics (Psych 27) under Dr. Mary Ann
Hartz. Valen works in the statistics
lab, helping any students who are
having difficulties. His work
benefits the students by “adding a
much more personal atmosphere.”
‘‘'It's a lot of work, Valen says,
“but I'm learning more now than
when I took the course for the first
time. You've really got to know it
well to be able to explain it.”
The opportunity is giving him a
greater perspective on the whole
learning process in the university.
“it’s like looking on both sides of
the fence. You know the problems
of students and of the teacher.“
Dr. Irene Frieze, teaching a
course on the Psychology of
Women. suggests that students
enjoy having a peer as a teacher.
“In a discussion, they're more
likely to understand each other and
see things the same way.”
Frieze's course is divided between

lectures and small seminars. The .

three undergraduate teaching ass-
istants and one graduate student
each lead a seminar and prepare a
number of lectures throughout the
term. The fellowships, in Frieze’s
view, are a good opportunity for
everyone involved and provides
herself with a good way to learn
about students.

Charles Hopkins and Prudence
MacKinney are two of the
undergraduate teaching fellows in
Frieze’s class. Hopkins summar-
izes the experience this way, ‘‘I
had the opportunity to do it and
now I’m nlad I did.” MacKinney

It's never good policy to believe a

pleasure to have one's prejudices

I'm not saying this is the greatest
movie ever made.lTherc are a lot of
things a nitpicker could nitpick on.

But who cares? Pelham is fast
moving, superbly paced, and one of
the best ways to spend a couple
hours in a movie theatre. It's great
entertainment, which, of course, is
the basic requirement of the movie
industry, and one too lately
overlooked.

 

Pelham seems to have found the
right blend of humor and suspense.
timing the humor to relive the
tension atjust the right moment, to
keep it from “over~building“ and
straining the audience's reactions
too soon beforelthe climax. with a
well controlled underplaying of
violence. And except for a silly
caricature of a New York mayor,
the humor seems perfectly natural,
basic New Yorker cynicism.

For example, when the passen-
gers of the unfortunate car are told
of the -hijacking, their reaction is
not your basic’ movie panic, but
indignation and annoyance: “I’m
gonna miss an important appoint-

Joke Book appears to concentrate

on detectives. This is merely a
devious disguise for their ﬂippant
foolishness——‘their unpatriotic atti-
tudes are still apparent. .
In "The Further Adventures of
Nick Danger, Third Eye," they
parody American detective movies
of the thirties and forties. Let's see
these subversives.do better than
The Maltese Falcon! How dare
they ridicule what they cannot
begin to approach in artistry!
Slandering American heroes is not
enough for them. Sherlock Hol-
mes, the great fictional sleuth of
our neighbors across the ocean is
viciously attacked. In a script
called “The Giant Rat of Sumatra“
purportedly from “The Cheque

Book of Hemlock,Stones," they
label their hero “the great defect-.
ive.”

..There a-re more blatant attacks‘

on our honored ancestors and
values. Not even Thomas Jefferson
escapes their wrath—they attribute
the ‘remark “Let's invite over‘ a
bunch of immigrants and make
cars!" to the distinguished states-
man. - '
Nothing is sacred for these snivel-
ing“sycophants. Even Good, yes
even the Lord is lampooned! While
reminiscing, an old aviator recalls
that God was his co-pilot...God was
killed during a raid and dumped as
baHasL '

This unwholesome material is
being swallowed up by our gullible

\

young people. And contumacious
college critics help spread this filth.

I read a quote from one Harris
Levy in the Pitt News:

The Firesign Theatre’s hilarious
new volume shows that it’s possi-
ble to effectively transfer comedy
from records to books. Using
detectives as «a typical example,

they undermine traditionally -~ rel-

vered ideals with plays on words
and puns while contemperary re-
ferences and allusions to Firesign
Theatre routines add complexity
and depth. By using history and.
literature to comment on the cur-
rent scene, The Firesign Theatre
transforms parodies into satires of
modern values. Some of the 11
routines are too obscure, but they”

farilycriticize phony hippies as well
as conservatives in some‘ of the
funniest writing of the past few
years.” '

 

.. P“ _
How could anybody possibly listen/‘$3:

to this ‘misguided young fellow.
Send these kids to college and all
they learn is how to bite the hand
that feeds them.

Now you have been forewarned.
Don‘t let those hoodlums hoodwink
you with their reprehensible rub-
bish. And remember, only you can
prevent forest fires. .

seem to be strange bedfellows at

delightful.

Side one opens with “I Am

“Dream, Nightmare and Dawn-

Panthers seeming hungrier than
the Penguins, grabbing a 20-12

Pitt who made the most of the

George Welsh’s crew took the

yards in 14 plays with backup man
Mike Roban at the helm, scram-
bling around the ends and throwing
for, two key receptions. Fullback
Bob Jackson carried the ball in
from the Pitt two yard line, the only
TD the‘ Pitt defense would allow,
with 1:21 left to play.

Roban, who played ‘for. a short
time in the second quarter and
fumbled twice, had taken over for
starting signal caller Phil Poirer,
who became another victim of the
manhunting Pitt defense when
defensive end Tom Perko blasted
him in the opening minutes of the
final frame. .

Continuing to show some re-
gained poise, Roban hit tight end
Kevin Sullivan over the middle for
the two point conversion and
suddenly Navy was within the
margin of a winning field goal,
13-11. .

Everyone in Annapolis knew what
was coming next.

Navy kicker Steve Dyckes placed
the ball on the left hash marks and
faced a ﬁve man Pitt front line,
composed ’mainly, of linemen.
Dyckes’ onside boot squibbed for
the left sidelines while Pitt’s
outside tackle headed for the center

Navy possession on the Pitt 47 with

that series of crucial plays, but
throughout the afternoon to save
the butterfingered offense.; The
Panther offense coughed up the
ball six times with Navy recovering
four, almost setting another Navy-

Penn State upset scene without a...

driving rain. . -

The Pitt bench received a scare
earlier in the game when Dorsett
left the field limping after
scrambling to control a wild pitch
by quarterback Bill Daniels.
Dorsett was swarmed under by a
host of Middies and sat out the next
series of plays with an icepack
taped to his right knee.

He returned to play seemingly I

100% healed and racked up 108
yards on 25 carries and one
touchdown. .

Dorsett had to fight tooth and nail
for most of his yardage, as the
Navy defense contained" him to the
outside and nailed him for two
losses on bad pitches from Daniels.

“Before the game I kinda felt we
were going to be infer a long
afternoon," Dorsett said. “It
wasn’t an attitude problem, but we
knew Navy would be ready for us
after getting beat by some
outrageous scores. I was flat in the
early going and I think we all will
admit we were. It’s kinda tough to
get up for a game like this’."’

Pitt took a 3-0 lead into the locker-
room at half time on Long’s 46 yard
field goal in the first quarter. The
play was set up after sophomore

defensive tackle'Don Parrish '

covered a Roban fumble on the
Navy 27.

Parrish led the Pitt front four with
three sackstof the quarterback for a
total of 29 yards. Romano, Burley
and linebackers Kelcy Daviston
and Arnie Weatherington kept the
offense from self-embarrassment
throughout the game.

Navy's first field goal came after
Pitt’s fifth fumble, another pitch"
from Daniels that eluded Dorsett,
and the Middies recovered on the.
Panther‘s 28. Once again the Pitt

_defense stiffened but Dyckes

booted a 32 yarder to cut the lead to
6-3 in the third quarter. _

“I was very happy to see the clock
tick off the 1st few seconds,”
Majors said. “We have been very
impressed with George Welsh and
his crew and the way they have
prepared for our games in the last
two years. It was a ball game we
could have very‘ easily lost.”

Not much news breaks from the

jam- the Vingt du Mai soccer
stadium at just thatungodly hour.
At that time [10 pm Tuesday here]
the heavyweight boxing champion-
ship of the world will be decided in
Kinshasa, Zaire, between current
champ George Foreman and
ex-champ Muhammad Ali. Tickets
at the stadium are selling for prices
ranging from $10 to $200, and total
revenues including. closed-circuit

tee each fighter $5‘ million.

out of both camps. The fighters
have attempted to psych each other
with different strategies.

Ali has displayed the same
taunting, rhyming rhetoric that
earned him the nickname “Gase-
ous Cassius" about the time he ﬁst
won the title 10 years ‘ago. He’s
mixed old lines like “Float like a
butterfly, sting like a bee” with

i new verses like “Shaving in the

Morning," a 40-line satire directed
mainly at the cut over Foreman’s
right eye that postponed the ﬁght
from September 23..

At a press conference last week,

Ali accused Foreman of using the .

cut to get out of the fight. It was
one of several attacks on Foreman,
who was supposed to be in
attendance but stayed away, saying
“If I had showed up, the fight
would have taken place right
there.” ‘

With that being one ofjust a few
exceptions, Foreman’s verbal ap-
proach has been low-key: he's even’
said he likes Ali as a person, and
for the contributions he’s made. to
boxing. Foreman has left it_to his
advisor, Archie Moore, to provide
answers to Ali's cracks.

Sports Illustrated carried a short
Moore essay which included apoem
to Ali that ended: “When his right
connects with your lower mandible:
/Goodbye, jaw." Moore went on:
“This time you are in real trouble, I
must publicly warn you. After the
ﬁght, you can even hide out a few
years in the jungle. slide into
Louisville about midnight, and
nobody would ever know."

Ali will have about 70% of the
stadium behind him Wednesday
morning but that represents a
substantial decrease since early
September. Even Ali’s wife has

been seen wearing a George-

Foreman button, and Joseph
Mobutu, President of Zaire,
recently made Foreman the gift of a

undefeated in three games, will
next host the Maryland Jayvees at
Pitt'Stadium November 12.

SPARKING THE JV ATTACK is frosh Willie Taylor, who combined

lion cub.

Foreman. who has held the
championship since his decisive
victory over Joe Frazier in January
'73, weighed in at 220 pounds
Saturday and appeared to be in
ideal condition for the ﬁght. His
training program has been rather

light -- only last week he did his _

ﬁrst sparring since suffering the
cut, and went only two easy rounds
with eighth-ranked heavyweight
Henry Clark.

Clark impersonated Ali by danc-
ing away, as Foreman attempted to
perfect his methods of cornering an
elusive ﬁghter. There is little doubt
that Foreman’s punches can

destroy Ali, but the question is'

whether he can catch Ali with

.enough of them.

Using the excuse that he’ll need
more weight to go 15 ‘rounds in hot
weather, Ali weighed in at 216’/3,
eight pounds more than a week
ago. His workouts have been
considerably more rigorous than
Foreman’s, yet his legs have been
full of spring afterward, just as
they were in his younger days. He
too seems to be in top physical
shape for his style of boxing. He
says he’s been getting up at four
o’clock every morning, and that the
strange time of the ﬁght may
bother his opponent more than
himself.

Foreman will be trying topcorner
Ali and show him that “barroom
ﬁghters" (Ali’s word) can be the
best kind: if he gets Ali in a
slugging match at close quarters,
he’ll beat him. Meanwhile, Ali will
be dancing at arm's length or
further, and coming close only
occasionally in hopes of cutting
Foreman’s face: if the fight
becomes a battle of long-range
jabs, Ali will-win.

The questions are 1) will Ali’s
extra bulk slow him down, 2) can
his old legs keep him away from
Foreman's power,‘ and 3) does
Foreman have enough boxing skill
to corner Ali and bring his superb
punching skill to bear.

for their vocal disagreement with a
personal toul call against the
Saints.

After 18 minutes of trying to get
off a play. officials sent both teams
to the sidelines while the band
attempted to sooth the fans.

When Gabriel returned, the boos
diminished and he was able to call
a play, but momentum had been

destroyed and they had to settle for
Dempsey's field goal.

Gabriel was unable to move the
ball in the on/e minute following the
Saints’ final score. A tenacious
New Orleans defense sacked the
big quarterback once and forced
him to run out of the. pocket with
less than 30 seconds left. eating up
valuable time.

hind 7-6 in the dying minutes of the
first half. then exploded for 28
points in the second half.

The victory delayed Cincinnati
Coach Paul Brown's bid for his
200th professional victory and bad-
ly damaged the Bengals‘ chances
to repeating as the AFC Central

, Division champs.

Cincinnati quarterback Ken An-
derson‘set a club passing record
with 30 completions in 43 attempts
for 352 yards.

A disbelieving crowd ‘of 55,434
began ﬁling out of the stadium
early in the last quarter as it
became obvious the Bengals were
doomed to one their worst outings
in years.

The victory lifted Houston to a 2-5
record while the Bengals dropped
to 4-3.

Bro wns Upset Broncos

CLEVELAND AP - Quarterback
Brian Sipe entered the game in the
fourth quarter and scored two
touchdowns to lead the Cleveland
Browns to a 23-21 victory over the
Denver Broncos in the National
Football League Sunday.

Sipe, making only his second

’ appearance of the season replacing

starter Mike Phipps, scored the
winning touchdown from the one
yard line with 1:56 remaining in the
game.

The winningscore was set up by a
72-yard punt return by Greg Pruitt,
which gave the Browns the ball on
Denver's four yard line.

Charlie Johnson of Denver threw
his first touchdown pass, a
12-yarder to tight end Riley Odoms
ending in a 76-yard drive and
giving the Broncos a 7-0 lead.

In the second period, the Broncos
took a 14-0 lead, when Johnson hit
wide receiver Jerry Simmons with a
13-yard touch down pass to end a
56 yard drive.

Three minutes later, Don Cockroft

booted a 27 yard field goal, making
it 14-3.

Twice in the third period, the
Browns, 2-5, couldn't sustain
touchdown drives and had to settle
for three points.

Cockroft booted ﬁeld goals of 30
and 25 yards, narrowing the
Browns deficit to 14-9 midway
through the third period.

The Broncos, 3-3-1, followed up

when Otis Armstrong capped a 57

yard drive with a 33 yard
touchdown scamper and the
Broncos led 21-9.

With 5:27 remaining in the game,
Sipe went eight yards on a keeper,
bringing the Browns within 21-16.

The drive was sparked by a fake
punt, and Cockroft completed a 27
yard pass play to cornerback Van
Green for a first down.

  soME STRAIGHT TALK To THE

PROSPECTIVE STEREO BUYER

The common notion that all hi-fi dealers are the same is
a fallacy.

The dealer you buy from is very important. Even among
the various audio component specialists, you'll find important

differences. They’re generally broken down into four distinct‘

areas: price, selection, warranty, and service.

At this point, it’s impossible for us to stay modest. We excel
over our competition in all four areas above.

That’s a pretty broad statement, but we can back it up as
follows.

Price. If, within 30 days of purchase, you discover any au-
thorized dealer selling the same equipment with comparable
guarantee for a lower price, bring in the proof and The Audio
Warehouse will gladly refund the difference. Likewise, of
course, we'll beat this quote if you haven’t purchased yet.

Selection. We carry most major brands and only brnad
name products (no private label). If you don't see a particular
item or brand, ask; we have many products in stock for immedi-
ate delivery that may not be on display in the particular store
where you‘re shopping.

Warraiity. We’re one of the miniscule number of hi-ti deal-
ers whose warranty is actually better and longer than most
of the manufacturers themselves:

We guarantee the speaker system (parts and labor) five
years. So the Advent or Pioneer speaker you buy from us is
different than the Advent or Pioneer you could buy from the
dealer down the street. ‘

We guarantee the electronic components (parts and labor)
3 yrs. The turntable or changer or tape deck (repair) 1 year.
Parts subject to wear. such as stylii, tape heads. belts. etc,
are guaranteed for 90 days only. *

We also have a money back guarantee in case you change
your mind within 7 days. '

And a 100% equipment exchange program if you prefer
something else within 90 days (we'll credit you full price toward
the purchase of any other component or combination of compo-
nents at the normal list price). A

We have a one year speaker exchange. as follows. The Audio
Warehouse will allow your full purchase price towards any more
expensive speaker we carry, within one year. (Reductions will
be made for cabinet damage. and the policy doesn't apply to
speakers that are the same except for cabinet style».

Now for the fine print. The guarantees extend from original
date of purchase and are limited to the original purchaser only
and are not transferable. They're automatically voided by the
misuse or abuse of any component; they‘re applicable only to
those component sound systems specifically recommended by
The Audio Warehouse. In its print advertising: and lastly. they
require that all equipment returned under any of the provisions
of the warranty be in original condition with all packing mater-
ial. accessories. and instruction books intact and not defaced.

Which is only fair.

Okay. now the fourth area. Service. What we try to do. basic-

ally. is remove as much technical hassle as possible from your
purchase. We take Bank-Americard. Master Charge: we de-
liver. set-up and install free: and we have a loaner program
to take the misery out of being without your music if some-
thing‘sonthe blink.

Last but not least. should you ever encounter any problems.
with your system or with us. or have any comments. please feel
free to call me. My name is Chuck Cliewning and l‘m really
concerned about your satisfaction. (‘all meat ($82-:32()().
