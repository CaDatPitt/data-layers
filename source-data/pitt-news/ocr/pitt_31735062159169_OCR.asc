xMr. Sun Endorses
Guerrilla Warfare

For Chinese Forces

By ROBERT D. HAMILTON

Kuan-Han Sun, only chinese
student at Pitt who is a native of
China, came to Pitt because he
desired to study under Dr. Silver-
man of the chemistry department.

Asked his opinion of Chiang
Kai-Shek’s policy of guerrilla
warfare, Mr. Sun said, “Guerrilla

warfare? We Chinese lack mod-
ern equipment, and while our sol-
diers are very brave ﬁghters, it
is difficult for them -to cope with
the tanks and machine guns of
the Japanese. Our men have a
simple and effective method of
dealing with them, but it requires
a large number-of men to keep
it up.

“They simply load themselves
with bombs’ and lie down under
the tanks, or press themselves
over the muzzl.es of the machine
guns. I can vouch for the truth
of these stories. Many of my
friends are at -..-the front.”

Mr. Sun was visibly worried
over the shift in hostilities to
South China which has placed his
home very near the front. In
fact the front may have shifted
right to his home. He does not
I{l’10'-.V, since it take some time for
letters to reach him from there.

Chiang Improves
Concerning General Chiang
Kai-Shek, Time’s Man‘ of the

Year, Kuan-Han Sun had this to
say: “Chiang Kai—Shek is a far-
sighted and able man. He was
always a great military. leader,
and has lately improved greatly
as a statesman. Chiang was not
ready to go to war when Japan
began to ‘defend’ herself; that is
why'"lie"is' carrying on guerrilla
warfare now. He is marshaling
his forces and equipment.

A.s to his “kidnapping’ by Young 4

Chang, or I-Isao—Liang Chang, as
the Chinese call him, Mr. Sun ex-
plans that this was merely an at-
tempt on Chang’s part to force
Chiang Kai-Shek to begin hos-
tilities with the Japanese in Man-
churia before Chiang was prepar-
ed to do so.

The misunderstanding was
patched up when Hsao-Liang
Chang discovered General!

Chiang’s diary, in which he had
written his plans concerning war
with the Japanese at a later date.
Of Hsao-Liang Chang‘ himself,
Mr. Sun says he is “no good,” and
“not important in Chinese af-
fairs.”

Kuan-Han Sun believes that the
reports concerning secret Russian
aid to the Chinese are untrue, but
that Russia will in the future help
China with both men and money.
His reasons: Russia hates her old
enemy Japan, and would like to
aid China, but the Chinese gov-
ernment split with the Commun-
ists some time ago; the Chinese
Communists joined the National-
ist Party, and it is not possible
under the circumstances, “to co-
operate quickly.”

United China

Kuan-Han Sun is strongly in
favor of a United China, which
he believes is both possible and
desirable. His conclusions are
based on his personal experience,
as he had spent some time travel-
ing all over China before coming
to the United States.

He thinks it should have a re-
public form of government mod-
eled on that of the United States
of America, andthat the task of
consolidating the many hetero-
geneous parts and peoples of Chi-
na lies in the education of her
young men and women in West-
ern ways. fln other words, Chi-
na’s future lies in the hands of
Kuan-Han Sun and his fellows.

I shall not soon forget the pic-
ture of, an earnest little man,
plainly fearful over the nearness
of his home and family to the
front line trenches, anxiously re-
peating that ‘ the Chinese‘ lack
equipment and that they are “very
brave, very brave.” We

Recuperatcs
in Mountains

Women’s Athletic Association’s
“perfect cure for exam fever”
worked wonders for 15 women on
their last week-end trip to Laurel
Ridge on January-28, 29, and 30.
These women made short work of
their worries with such things as
skiing, ice-skating, and ﬁre-side
get-togethers which chased away
their fears of coming grades.

Since this affair was proclaimed
by all who participated to have
been such a success, members of
WAA are planning more outings
of this sort to follow.

Those women who were turned
away because of limited accom-
modations will be favored on the

list if they come early enough next
time to get in before the “dead
line.” * ?

Business M meager /innounces
Change In News Distribution

Copies Of Newspaper '

Available At Every
Cathedral Entrance

Jay Reich, BA39, business
manager of The Pitt News, an-
nounces that a new distribution
policy for The News will go in-
to effect beginning with today ’s
issue.

The News will be placed at

all entrances to the Cathedral,»
both on the ground floor and the,

Commons Room ﬂoor.

Students are urged to co-operate;
by taking one copy only and by’

securing that copy each day at the
same location, in order that the

circulation staff may judge each:

entrance’s need.

“It is believed,” Reich says,
“that this will facilitate the dis-
tribution of the News so that every
student can receive a copy of each
issue.”

Under the new setup The Pitt

Jews will now be found at the

following locations: .

1. Commons Room Floor: Fifth

A avenue entrance and Bigelow
boulevard entrance.

2. Ground Floor: Forbes street
‘entrance,
entrance (one nearest Forbes
street), and Bi;-relow boule-
vard entrance (one nearest
Fifth avenue).

There will also be a table of Pitt

News copies located by the ground.

floor elevators. Distribution "in

other buildings on thecampus will

remain the same.

issues Bulletin

On itayon Sales  

Newest" of‘ the “Merchandise
Facts” manua.l‘s"i’ss7ued by the Re-
search Bureau for Retail Training
is “Facts about Rayon.”

This booklet includes the ABC’s
of successful sellingof rayon, man-
ufacturing processes of rayon, sell-
ing points of rayon, and the new
vocabulary of rayon fabric terms.

It is particularly pertinent at
this time because of the new rul-
ings on rayon passed by the Fed-
eral Trade Commission. The new
law "requires salespeople to call
fabrics by their right name. For
instance, if a fabric is rayon satin
it cannot be termed satin.

Starting February 15 and ex-
tending to,A.pril 6, the Bureau is
conducting evening classes for de-
partment store employes. Some
of the courses offered are: ‘pho-
tography taught by Luke Swank;
the art of letter-writing by Theo-
dore Siedle; and current inﬂuences
in retailing.

At A iforum

_Dr. Johni J. Geise, assistant
professor of history, will address
this semester’s initial meeting of
S'E"A-sponsored St'udent-Faculty
Forum Friday at 1 o’clock in 24
Cathedral. Subject of Dr. Geise’s
address will be “History Comes
Into Its Own.” A

The  which will intro-
duce the-open forum to be con-
ducted by Dr. Geise, will treat
current development in historical
study. ,

According to the speaker, his-
torical stury is experiencing a
change from factual to interpreta-
tive emphasis.

The forum was inaugurated at
the beginning of last semester.
Lasting until 2 o’clock, the ses-
sion will be divided between Dr.
Geise’s address and open discus-
sion by students and faculty mem-
bers in attendance.

Social Science
Forum Hears  
Dr. Hankins

A special meeting of the Social
Science Seminar Friday will hear
Dr. Frank Hamilton Hankins, pro-
fessor of economics and sociology
at Smith college, Northampton,
lVIass., as featured speaker.

The meeting will be held in the
private dining room of the Facul-
‘Cy Club. Dr. Hankins’ talk is
scheduled to begin at 1:15 o’clock,
after‘ a luncheon planned for
12:30.

This meeting of the Seminar is
considered one of the outstanding
of the monthly series, because the
principal speaker is being brought
from another school. In previous
conferences this term, the science
group has heard University in-
structors. —

Different, too, at this Friday’s
meeting is the fact that the gen-
eral faculty is invited. Only
Seminar members have been in-
vited formerly. _

Dr. Hankins received his AB
degree from Baker university in
.1901, and his PhD. from Columbia
in 1908. In 1922. hebegan at
j Clark university, where he re-
?mained until 1932, when he joined
the Smith college faculty.

Peace Council
To Discuss Boycott

CCORDING to a news story on 
A toil-5-..y, the Pitt Peace Council will discus:~;
plans ‘iiliis afternoon concerning the advisabil-
ity of conducting a boycott of Japaiiese goods
on the Uni.ver.‘ity of Pl‘;lSl3Lll‘gll campus.

"The question of an Anti-Japanese Boycott
has aroused the interest of students through-
out the nation, and at many Universities and
colleges such a program has been underway
for some time.

‘While the movement has been planned as a
sanction against Japan for her aggression in
China, whenever the question is discussed
across the table there are doubts as to whether
the boycott will aid or hinder the movement
for universal peace.

This afternoon Pitt Peace Council will de-
cide for itself whether such a program will
help their cause, and its decision will be
brought to the attention of the entire campus.

As a student of the University, we suggest
that you attend the meeting today,_hear the
pros and cons, and take an active interest in
the peace program which is underway here.

If or when the United States is drawn into
war, it will be too late for peace movements.
lVe suggest you participate now.

provide for reciprocal trade treaties.

It was a note of encouragement, but from
the hearings before the House Naval Affairs
Committee came a contradiction from Admiral
D. Leahy, chief of naval operations, who stated
that the United States navy must be enlarged.

Even if Secretary Hull ’s proposal is not ac-
cepted, there is considerable doubt‘, in the
minds of many who would keep this country
out of foreign wars, whether or not the gov-
ernmentishould spend $800,000,000 at this time
for a bigger navy.

It brings to mind the question of national
defense and whether the outlay of such a large
expenditure is necessary, whether such a large
navy as that which is proposed is required for

 

the national defense.

Those who build a bigger navy for us have

"never explained whether “national defense”
‘means the sending of marines and gun boats

.up the Yangtze to protect American “interests”
».o.i~ wliethér the protection of the coasts of con-

tiiiental United States is sufficient.

If t.he latter is true, they have not explained
how our nearest potential enemies would be
able to wage a successful attack on our isolat-
ed shoreseven with our present sea forces.

VVhile granting that the expenditure would
provide employment for some of our citizens,
we believe that the funds could be put to
better use in internal improvements while pro-
viding the same amount of employment.

If the proposed ships are built and the
$800,000,000 spent’, we see only one positive
thing to look forward to in 1942 and ’43;
Those battleships sailing in review in San
Francisco Bay will be a grand sight, and will
make stirring moving picture releases. And of
course the ﬂeet can always play war games
in the Pacific-—if it doesn’t ﬁnd something
more destructive to do.

Intercollegiate

Cat-astrophe

Ira H. Horton, tutor in zoology at the University
of Texas, announced publicly that zoo students do
not use the pet cats of Austin for lab courses. The
cats used come from the poorest section of Austin
and are of the alley variety. They must pass a
strict test before they are martyred for science.
Requirements are: ﬂeas, leanness, and bad tem-
pers. “House pets,” he said, “are generally sleek,
clean, and affectionate.”

He probably never read about mehitabel. Even
though m. was an alley cat she was toujours gai.

London Letter:

The London Times recently recognized with all
the dignity of an editorial the feat (or feet) of K.
H. H. Baily, a Bournemouth, Hampshire, accountant
who ran from Bournemouth to" the Paris Exhibi-
tion. After running to Southampton, Baily boarded
the Queen Mary and ran around the liner’s -deck
while crossing the channel, then around the tender
which took him into Cherbourg.

-Ie pranced up and down the platform while cus-
toms oﬁicers examined his baggage, and after a
brief sleep, continued his marathon to Paris.

“My idea was to do something to promote the
cause of international friendship,” Baily panted
when he arrived in Paris.

“People often say they will ‘run’ over to Paris
but never do,” remarks The Times. Here at last the
feat is done. Captious critics will be wrong who
say this deed does not advance the cause of inter-
national friendship for, judged at its very lowest
level, what can be done to injure the cause of in-
ternational friendship?

“Nothing at all in an epoch which has seen so
many of Europe’s oldest values crumble!” declares
The Times. “The reaffirmation of the continental
axiom, ‘All Englishmen are mad,’ is most timely and
will be welcome in France and elsewhere
Finally, Baily proceeded to Paris without complain-
ing either of the French railways or of the French
customs, in itself a circumstance which helps to
cement Franco—British friendship.”

We have often heard of shirt-sleeve or kitchen
cabinet diplomacy, but this is the first we are cogni-
zant of gum-shoe tactics. However, we wonder
what would happen if the U. S. government sent
Glenn Cunningham prancing over to Japan and ex-
ercising his biceps in front of the imperial doors.
Personally, if we were Mr. C. we should prefer to
use our talents in running right back home again.

Web-tide :

An unauthenticated tale about the infant pre-
cocity of Dr. Samuel Johnson is told by Boswell in
his biography of that gentleman. Apparently, when
Johnson was but three years old, he accidently trod
upon a duckling, the eleventh of a brood, and it
died, poor thing. Upon which, it is said, he built
the following epitaph:

“Here lies good master duck,
Whom Samuel Johnson trod on;

If it had lived, it had been good luck,
For then we’d had an odd one.”

And now we think we’d better duck off and quill
two birds with one Corner Stone. Ugh!

“Well, Mr. Murble, what can Ii

ILLIAM D. (BILL) WHITLEY sold over 15
million pounds of tobacco last year. It’s
easy to see that he’s an expert who knows tobacco.

So it’s important to you when he says . . .“At
14 different markets in Georgia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, I’ve
seen Luckies buy the best tobacco. I ﬁgure it’s
good tobacco that makes a good smoke. So my
own cigarette is Lucky Strike!

“I’ve noticed, too, that independent buyers,
not connected with any cigarette manufacturer,
smoke Luckies more than any other brand.”

Mr. Whitley is correct. For sworn records
show that, among independent tobacco ex-
perts, Luckies have twice as ma.nyexclu-
sive smokers as have all other cigarettes put
together. Remember: The men who know
tobacco best smoke Luckies 2 to I.

HAVE YOU HEARD "Tl-IE CHANT OF
THE TOBACCO AUC'|'IONE_ER"
ON THE RADIO?

When you do, remember that Luckies
use the finest tobacco. And also -Ihaf
the "Toasting" process removes certain
harsh irritants found in g_|_l Iobacco.So
Luckies are kind to your throat.

Olson cracked a smile when he

Matmen Ready
F or Temple

When Temple steps out on the
Stadium ﬂoor Friday, they will be
facing a team of Panther grap-
plers that is determined to win.
For the first time this season Pitt
will‘ be on an equal basis with its
opponents. Although the Panth-
ers have dropped both of their
matches so far, they have faced
really tough competition», and
have picked a lot of valuable ex-
perience.

Heading the Pitt squad will be
Captain Rudy Tomarelli who
wrestles in the 125-pound class
and who captured one of the three
Pitt victories in the Case clash.
Other Panthers who won from
Case were 145-pounder Larry
Roofner and heavyweight Frank
Kristufek.

The Temple encounter will be
the last time this season that Ed-
die Mazeski’s outﬁt will appear
in the Stadium. Matches with
Kent State Teachers College,
Waynesburg, and West Virginia

will be on foreign mats.

strongest teams in the group, Du-
quesne and John Carroll.
PANTHERS IMPROVE

But, with itsre juggled lineup,
that found Bob Schooley and Paul
Kennedy defense stars in the for-
ward Wall, Pitt took on the as-
pects of a fast skating offensive
combination that has caused a
furore around the league. with its
lethal sharp shooting and effective
body checking. . ~

Pitt’s abrupt about-face com-
pletely overwhelmed Tech and
Baldwin-Wallace and has labeled
them among the hottest things on
ice in collegiate circles.

Tonight, Pitt will continue its
drive towards the top against Mc-
Gill and company of Duquesne.
In the last meeting, Pitt and the

.Duke did more pushing around

and ﬁghting than hockey, but put
on one of the most exciting exhi-
bitions of the season that saw Pitt
downed, 3-0.
LEAD AT STAKE

Should Pitt take the Dukes in
stride they will force a two-way
tie with Duquesne for the Eastern
leadership and on the other hand
a Duke win will place them four
points ahead of the pack.

McSorley indicates the follow-
ing lineup will start for Pitt: Bud
Ellis in the nets, Lovett and Broi-
do on defense. Bob Schooley

and Taylor Britton at wings with

Dick Friday at center round out
a forward wall. ‘

In the opening game of the
doubleheader Tech meets Fenn

Smarting under“ the eﬁects of
their recent defeat at the hands of
a powerful Syracuse team, the
Panther mittmen look forward to
the Temple match on Friday.

According to statistics, the Pitt
boys lost by a 3 point margin, 5%
to 2%, but looking at the score
from the local point of view, the
ﬁnal count might have been dif-
ferent.

After getting off to a glorious
start with Ralph Dorand winning
a decision and Johnnie Wargo
kayoing his "opponent, Ralph Ca-
ruso lost a questionable bout to
a local Syracuse lad. Jedio Curzi
lost another close one and Bay
Bombe drew a draw which ac-
cording to the Syracuse mentor,
should have been a victory for the
Pitt boy.

The defeat was not the only
thing handed the locals; Andy

GoyaOi1 Portrait

Spanish Artist
Has Work Shown
In Frick Exhibit

By ROBERT M. BROWN -

‘.‘The last of the great tradi-
tiona.list.s” is the phrase Hen-
drick \-Villem van Loon, the
genial Dutchman who attempts
to make America. culture-corp
scious, uses to .de_scribe art of
Francisco Goya, the most class-
conscious of V Spanish artists. .

It is a. portrait by Goya-
“Julia Ascenio”——which seems to
be attracting most of the atten-
tion of the students who visit the
current Frick collection of pic-
tures hung in the seventh-ﬂoor
galleries of the ﬁne arts depart-
ment. A glance at the little
Spaniard’s life might aid towards
a fuller appreciation of the pic-
ture. ~ -

HAPSBURG. REGIME . .1

Goya’s greatness is all the more
remarkable when his background
is considered. Spain was rotten.
She had fallen in prestige ever
since the day in 1588 when the
Armada of Phillip II had been
beaten by the ships of Sir Fran-
cis Drake. Since that time, the
land had fallen into decay, and
the country was ruled by the weak
Hapsburg kings who sat in their
chilly castles high up on the
gaunt hills of Castile.

Spain was reduced in power
by the great armies of France
and Prussia who sweptthe land
into desolation. All that remain-
ed was a court that triﬂed in bar-
ren displays, adultery, intrigues,
and ennui. In addition to the
court,
Goya was a peasant.

He was born in 1746,
Napoleon was still an agitator on
Corsica and the new romanticism
was just beginning to be talked
about.
his full powers as a painter, Bona-
parte had put one of his puppets
on the Spanish ‘throne, Ferdinand
VII. 3

He proceeded to lambast the
new regime in a series of etch-
ings—the Caprichos¥that” remain
the most scathing indictments of
mankind outside of Jonathan
Swift. There is nothing in all
art like these positive nightmares
of horror.

DUCHESS’ PORTRAIT

After the French had completed
a" particularly destructive raid,
Goya would steal out of his lodg-
ingsiat‘ night and by the aid of a
torch,iwould turn over the dead
bodies in his search for the most
gruesome model~ for his next
plate.

His skill as a painter was such
that hegcould do a portrait in a
few hours, and this skill once
saved his neck. He was doing a
nude portrait of the infamous
Duchess of Alba—-the second nude
ever to be painted in Spanish art
up to that time—and the Duke
heard of it. He vowed to his re-
tainers that he would go to the
painter-’s studio at night to ﬁnd
outtif this were true.

Goya learned of the Duke’s
plans; made the Duchess don
clothes and painted her portrait
a second time; so that when the
Duke blustered into the studio,
his wife, fully clothed, smiled
back at him from the canvas.

The portrait in the Frick col-
lection of one of Goya’s pupils, is
quite famous. It shows an ex-
traordinary use of bright color-
ing, and Goya, using an old

sculptors’ trick, put small dots of
paint in the eyeballs and on the
tip of the nose, so that the por-
trait has a distinct personal fla-
vor, quite different from the other
portraits hung in the show.

Goya died at the age of 83. He
was ﬂeeing. from Spain with the

duchess of Alba when the axle- _

tree of his carriage broke. With
his characteristic energy heimade
a ﬁre and -’ forgeand mended the
axle. The exertion was too much
for him and hesuffered a stroke
of apoplexy. . »

University assemblies, Freshman
Camp, Pitt Peace Council, and

In. his last campus appearance,

he saw a great need ‘for a ‘well’-
directed promotion of the cause
or peace «inthe publicmind. Civil-

and higher levels” if such a pro-
gram were-actually carried out,
