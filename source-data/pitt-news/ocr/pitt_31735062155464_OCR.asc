1 Customs Committee. Seeking

Better Representation

Affiliation of‘ sophomore customs

committee with the W. S. G. A. or-
ganization, a campus conference for
officers of all women’s activities,
and a book tea are among the plans
that are under discussion by W. S.
G. A. to

A deﬁnite need for aicloser rela-
tion‘ between" sophomore customs

committee and some other group‘

has been evident for some time. Ten-
tative suggestions include linking.
the customs committee with the sen-

ior court, W. S. G. A. judiciary body, ~

with W. S. G. A. ‘commission, or
forming a closer link with the soph-
omore class itself through the soph-
omore . S. G. A. representative,
byautomatically making the soph-
omore representative lchairmani of
the customs committee. 3

No Representation’

The customs. comm-it_tee has rep- V

resentation neither on itsown class
commission nor on W. S. G. A. corp-~
«mission at the present time. Since
the organization of the ‘committee
ﬁve years ago, the chairman has
been appointed by the sophomore
class president with the approvaliof
the dean of women and W. S. G. A.
executive committee. ’. ~_
“The customs committee is dis-
tinctly a part of the i sophomore
class and it is not our purpose‘ to
make a breach between the class
and’-the committee,”. states Fannie
Mae- Charlesworth, Ed. ’30,  S.
G. -A. president. -“We want to bring
a closer .co-operation between the
three organizations.” _ ,
i “There is a decided need for some
closer unity between our commit-
tee and the sophomore class,” agrees-
Llda Jones, Ed. ‘ ’32, present sous-
toins gchairman. . “However, ‘our’ fall

_ ¢11S.t°¥!1S..reg1ll;9.:tiQ1?..S. were ;,es§r¢meJi-.

successful, for out ‘of “ api‘ii*6iéi-
rnately two hundred freshman-woin-,
en receiving ‘mar-it-P.aI_1thers‘. ?'Dnue
to the more ‘constructive system;-,of
regulations, and to the . closer“ con-
tact that the -sophomore women can
make, the women’s customs ‘had
muchbetter results than those :of
the men. But, no doubt.,,a-new plan
will prove even more successful.”

ing in _three and the v men in our
discussions. From now until March
10, -, the men’s squad will be inactive
as far.as actual debating goes.

a On Friday morning, during as-
sembly hour, there will. be tryouts
in Room 220 for the men’s' debat-
ing squad, in an effort to enlarge
the squad and to train_ menfor next
year; although, C. John Phillips ‘is

‘ According "43 Mr. W. M. Parrish,
associate pro.-essor in public speak-

tensive forensic activity in this‘
country. At the University of
Pittsburgh, theidea of debates has
changed, inasmuch as decisions‘ are
not desirable, the men trying to
avoid judges whenever possible.

-'I_‘he chief aim_ is not to‘ score vic-
tories, but to give students instruc-
tion and practice in. public discus-
ﬁons. Secondly, to ‘give interested
‘audiences an opportunity to hear
public questions fairly. and ade-

on every subject from “Scouting for ’

A change in the organization of the

announced this week when Van H.»
Fris,_Col. '30, advertising manager.
appointed two assistants, who will

be in direct charge of .two divisions ~

of the department. ‘Wayne Weaver,
Bus. Ad. ’33, and Franklin Kallfelz,
Eng. ’33, are the new assistants.

. lowing a semester during
which the advertising department
brokeall records in local.advertis-
mg, - the new arrangement is ex-
pected to bring. even‘ ‘greater re-

sults. “The new assistants, although ,

both freshmen, have displayed an ag-
gressiveness and interest which has
een the backbone of the best staff
the Weekly has ever had,” said Eris.
In conjunction with ‘revision-of
the ‘staff, Fris has inaugurated copy
writing and layout criticism for his

staff. Members are encouraged to .

write. Phacticep advertisments and
submit them for criticism in’ the
hope that the appearance of adver-
tisements in the Weekly will be.im-
proved from year‘ to" year. yThis
innovation is appreciated because
there are no classes in advertis-
mentwriting and layout in the

journalism department of the Uni-

game, the Panthers willmove on to
New York where they will stay un-
til Monday -when -they will hop to
Philadelphia for their game -I with
Temple-Tuesday. - » V I T V

Coach Carlson will take along the
same men who made the first east-

 

’ ern trip with the exception that Tim

Lawry. . will ‘replace ' Doc Kowallis
who is ineligible at present dueyto
scholastic. difﬁculties; ’ -
7 National Title at Stake ,

All of Pitt"s hopes for a. national
championship hinge on the results
‘of’ these I games. If the Panthers
can clean up onthis trip and then
win their remaining games with tri-

state teams, they will have a bet- 4

terclaim on national championship
honors than any other college, in-
cluding gMontana‘ State, Purdue,
Duke, Columbia and Syracuse.
Their task, however, will not be
an. easy one, for both Army and
Temple are considered to be two

of theleading teams of the east,

Army has copped nine out of eleven
games at home, and Temple has won
15 outof 16 thisyear, including a
winning streak of eleven straight
games at the presenttime.
. , Pitt Underdog

Comparative scores favor both
Army and. Temple in the coming
clashes. Army has defeated West
Vir-gi-nia by a 41-36 score this sea-
son and has defeated Carnegie Tech
by a 49-29 score. The Panthers hold
victories over both these teams. The

Mountaineers were defeated here by

a 21-19, score, and Carnegie. was
taken over to the tune of 48-25,"24-18-
and 47.23.
Army has defeated Columbia; 37-31.
Columbia defeated S y r a .c_ u s e
and Syiracuse ,in turn has defeated
the Panthers. All this may not
mean anything to the casual reader,
~but_it-qproves that on paper at least
the? Cadets have an advantage over
the Panthers. “ - '

In addition, the Cadets

they-. suffered here last year. Pre-
vious to that defeat, Army had co_m--
piled a‘. record of eight wins with
no losses, and the overwhelming de-
feat suffered here was a great blow
to their hopes._ Several of the boys
who -played against Pitt are still
playing for‘ Army, and they Wlll
ﬁght hard for revenge. 3 ~
Temple also will be a slight favor-
ite to down the Pitt passers; Temple
haswmade better showings than the
Panthers against West Virginia and
Wash-Jeff, and with the advantage

‘of ‘playing on their home court, they

are conﬁdent of avenging the 39-28
they received from the
‘Panthers last year.
Hyatt v. Wearshing
-«The Owls‘ are captained by Grov-

er Wearshing, the best defensive

guard in intercollegiate basketball
last year. In a totalwof twenty-one
games last year (not counting the

. Pitt gam‘e),~Wearshi’ng held his man

to a total’ of three baskets,,,an aver-
age of one ﬁeld goal for every seven
games. Even-counting the Pitt game
where Tlyattscored ﬁve ﬁeld_ goals
against him, the Temple captain held
his man toaan average of one-_ goal
in~*-every three games. He will be
assigned the duty of guarding Char-
1ey_Hya.tt; and he will, no;doubt,
try his best to stop the only man to
score more than one ﬁeld ‘ goal
against him last year. It will be
interesting to watch the results of
this clash between the best defen-
sive and the best offensive players
in intercollegiate ranks.

To conquer two such team is no
easy task. ‘If the Panthers can do
this, then they will repeat the feat
ofthe 1927'-28 ‘team of winning the
national collegiate title. »

At’ the outset’ of the game the

maintained a. safelead ithroughout‘.

The score at the ‘half ‘was 19-8. '
‘ ' Apgainstwest Virginia here last
Saturday,“ after a.17-17 tie atthe
half, the Panthers refused to at-
tempt further penetration of the

chose to freeze-the ball during near-
ly -all of the second half, contenting
themselves with a. slim Jnargin of
victory, the ﬁVnal'score" beingV21-19.
During the ﬁrst half“Pitt. would
have trailed but for Les Cohen’s ac-
curate shooting, Cohen accounting
for seven points during the first
twenty minutes. Captain Hyatt was
not in the lineup until themiddle
of the ﬁrst period. ' ‘ »  ,
During -theﬁrst few minutes of
the second half the Mountaineer’-s
zone defense ‘functioned eifectively
as usual; and the Pitt team ‘failed
to score until Paul Zehfuss tipped

‘ the ball.-in.to the basketduring a

jump-up against. a taller-rival. 
Following this, the
tauntingly. passed the ball around in

on the idea-toholddown thescore.
The men were all concentrated with-

With spring football less than
three weeks away, .one wonders
whether Coach Sutherland will show
us the afterresults of the California
debacle. The dope has it" that 6V_-‘or
8 weeks of training is onhand for

the varsity aspirants. I would take‘

a guess that after the iron wall de-
fense and the fundamentalsghave
been _p_erf ectly taught by the great-
