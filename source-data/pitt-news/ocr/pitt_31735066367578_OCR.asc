Woody Turner and Ann Abbi-
nanti, last year’s senior Worthies,
presented the 1961 Senior worth-
ies, at noon, with the wooden
spoon which is one of the Uni-
versity’s oldest traditions.

The tradition began when it
was awarded to the class of 1871
following a blistering speech by
the chancellor about the child-
ishness of the students.

The spoon, carved from a tree
that grew on the old campus, was
given as a reminder that the class .
had to be spoon—fed. Since then
this accusation has been denied
with the awarding of the spoon to
the leading members of the junior
class.

Career Interviews for Women

The Travelers Insurance Com-
pany of Hartford, Connecticut,
will conduct a seminar on campus
to discuss career opportunities for
women in the insurance business.
A deﬁnite date has not yetbeen

set.

Specific career areas to be dis-
cussed are underwriting of Group

gramming or data processing.

The Group Insurance under-
writer must determine the appro-
priate policy coverages and pre-
mium rates, have the ability to
write clearly, and have a fairly
comprehensive knowledge of math.

Statistical analysis involves
conducting programs of statisti-
cal research as an aid to the
actuaries of the Life. Accident

Programming and data process-
ing require the analysis of pro-
cedure and the writing of machine
instructions for various phases of

taken by a new electronic com-
puter, the RCA 501.

Women interested in attending

these seminars may pick up cards
at the Placement Bureau, second
ﬂoor SU, now. A sufficient re-
sponse is needed to enable the
company to schedule the most ac-
commodating time.

Nurses

Donates Clothing,

M one y to Korean.

By CHRISTINE LUNDBERG

To Wee Sun Park, ﬁfteen-
year old Korean orphan, the
streets of America are paved
with gold. To her, the stories

of American children who al-
A ways have food and clothing,

family and love, are still a legend.

Wee Sun Park has a new fam-
ﬂy every _year. Her home is the
Good Samaritan Children’s Home,
Sun Lin Won, in Taegu, Korea,
and each year throu.gh the Everett
Swanson Evangelistic Association,

“—Wee Sun Park and other orpaans

are put up for adoption.

Her family today is Alpha
Tau Delta, a social sorority at
the University’s School of
Nursing. Judy Shupe, a sorority
member, explained that with a
large treasury for the year, the
girls wanted to ﬁnd a worth-
while project to help someone.

, They wrote to several agencies
l including Foster Parents’ Plan
and Everett Swanson, and decided
to adopt a Korean orphan. In De-
’ cember they chose Nee Sun Park,
whose name means “the first
virtue.” Since that time the girls
have donated $18 a month in ad-
dition to articles of clothing.

Little is known of Wee Sun
Park's early life. Her father
died and her mother deserted
her, leaving her the care and
support of a younger sister. Un-

‘ til September, 1954, she worked
as a. kitchen girl in a strange
home. Now she and her sis‘--:2‘
live at the orphanage.

In her first .h=."ter to her adopt-

ed family she vsrcte: “Dear Sister,

,.'-——I hope you will grant me to
call you my sister”

Judy Shupe exrfained that they
had thought of donating ' the
. money to charity. “But,” she con-
tinued, “we are so much happier
and excited with something tang-

clothes and pictures, and knowing
we’re helping one child in partic-
ular.”

   

Bingler Urges Students
To File 1960 Tax Now

All students who have not yet

urged to do so as soon as pos-

rector, has announced. A

Bingler explained that he is in-
terested in saving the taxpayers’
money, and unless we keep the
temporary employees as busy as
possible it will obviously be more
costly to process the returns.

The Beck group plans to use a

how diabetes affects the metabol-

the pancreas of animals.

Discussing some of the problems
associated with the insulin aspect
of the project, Dr. Beck said,
“Because it is more difficult to
isolate insulin than glutathione,
more refined techniques will be
needed for tracer work with in-

I  PROF]

The  en in Green

On Feb. 17, 1954, the School of Engineering and Mines
announced the inauguration of a week-long period aimed
at emphasizing the role of engineers at the University.

At the same time—that was only seven years ago——a
small group of engineering students and faculty members
stated that they hoped to make this Engineer’s .Week a tra-
dition at the University. A , _

With this tradition would come the engineer, St. Pat-
rick, the ‘green hats that students and faculty members
wear each year, and the motto “Erin Go Brae.”

The _purpose‘ of establishing this week‘ as a traditional

 

‘week on the University’s campus apparently. has succeeded
,since again this year, March. 13-17, will be reserved for the

engineers. 1
But one can’t help but wonder if designating one week

of the year as Engineer’s VVeek really does emphasize theW

role of the engineer on the University’s campus. _

The majority of students see only a group of students
invading the cathedral with their green hats, or carrying
ostentatious signs with the map of Ireland on it.

Is this the role of the engineer on a University’s cam-
pus? Well, this is exactly the impression they leave on most
people as they descend from that white building on the hill
to mingle with us down here.

Since we have tried to gain some insight into the role
of an engineer on campus through bold reporters, telephone
calls at three minute intervals and letters —— all to no avail
—— we have come to the conclusion that engineers don’t
really want to convey their role to the non-engineers.

If this is true, we wish that the purpose of St. Patrick’s

Engineers Week was merely a fun week; who would be-

grudge anyone who works as‘ hard as an engineer, a fun
week? _
B-ut if they (the engineers) maintain that this week is

«to emphasize the role of the engineer on this campus, and

for that matter, in society as well, we suggest that they try
to make it a year-long event. In this way, we will know
that engineers are more than men that wear green hats
during the third week of March;

From Bad to ‘Worse . . .

Woman's Perrogaiive

By Ronald Burford
The biggest trouble makers in the world are not
the Russians; they only have armies, missiles and

‘bombs with which to make trouble. Women are the

worst trouble makers; they have a lust for the
forbidden.

Hark back to the Garden of Eden. Things were’

perfect there. Adam and his
wife had everything that they
could possibly want except the
fruit of the “forbidden tree.”
Because it was forbidden, it fas-
cinated Eve. ‘It must be some-
thing real swell, hey. Like I
must possess that fruit, hey.”
She got it with the help ‘of an
old friend. Because of it, here
we all are. We’re living in any-
thing but a paradise. .

I should think that women
would have learned from that great disaster. They
didn’t. This very moment, women all over Amer-
ica are shinnying up forbidden trees in search of
another forbidden apple, sexual equality.
Toward One Sex

They looked over the social barrier in the nine-
teenth century and decided that the mens’ side was

greener. Since that time, they have been waging‘

a ﬁerce struggle to climb the barrier and enjoy the
swellgpeaches and honey life that we men lead.
But, they have overlooked something important. In
their ﬁght to become ‘equal, they are becoming more
and more masculine. Nothing is more revolting
than_ a masculine woman. What could be more

pleasingito a fellow than. to see a girl with I

shoulder-length hair, big blue eyes, full skirt, frilly

blouse, low heels and a big smile? What’ could be_

more revolting than a girl with a “parakeet” hair-
cut, squinting eyes, baggy jeans, old shirt, tennis

shoes and a cigarette dangling in front of nicotine-- .

stained teeth?
The only ones proﬁting from this social revolu-
tion are the girls who choose toiremailn completely

‘wild remark,” I can hear you challenge.) Women’
are entering the business world in huge numbers.l.

 

~feminine.. They have the pick of the best men as

dates and as husbands. Nobody worth anything
would marry a mannish, domineering woman. This
type of woman has even been classiﬁed as the
enemy of men. That’s why cartoonists use her as
a mother-in-law ﬁgure. ,

The men are certainly not proﬁting. Nine out
of seven guys like girls with whom they can kiss’
not shake hands. '
Losing the Fight

Women as a whole are losing rather than gain”
ing from their bid for equality. Although the ex-
tremists, for example, the “lady” wrestlers, bull
ﬁghters, astronauts and such, are proving to the
world" that American women can do anything that
American men can do, they are also making men
lose respect for womanhood in general. Men don";
give their seats on crowded buses to women under

sixty anymore. Nowadays, the only way a young.-—

woman can get a seat on a packed bus is to start
singing “The Star—Spangled Banner.” Unless he is
on a date, a fellow won’t.help a girl to cross a
puddle or maneuver over a snow bank. She is too
self-suﬁicient to need his help. At least, this is
what the ﬁghters for sexual equality keep telling
him. If chivalry is dead, women killed it.
Women must realize that they are not only
hurting themselves. A socialsrevolution is bound to
have enormous effects. They are fouling up the»

Some must work to support themselves because
they are single, widowed, divorced or separated.
Others, ‘however, ‘work while their husbands are

holding adequate jobs in order to be able to afford

the luxuries of life, two cars, split-level house,
twelve-foot freezer and a college education. for the
little ones. At the same time that. they are striving
for these honorable goals and are neglecting their
homes, they are holding jobs needed by jobless
workers to "support their families. Is this right?
Please stop rioting in the cafeteria and think.»

Co-ecl Watchers

By Jim Nelson
There hasbeen quite a bit, of discussion lately

about clothes. What to wear, when, and how to

wear it_. This brings to my mind ‘a rather humorous
experience I had about a month ago.

I was looking for a stamp’. Just a four cent one.
It was late at night and I
couldn’t go out anywhere. Being
one who appreciates the gener-
osity of others, I decided to bor-
row) or steal one from somebody
on my dorm ﬂoor.

I knocked on a door down the
hall, asked for a stamp, and was ' V
invited into the room. My plea 
for postage was answered and I 

stayed to talk for awhile. Sud- 
denly the door ﬂew open and '
everyone was breathless with

fear,’ (especially me because I was standing behind
the door). The doorway was ﬁlled with a ten-foot
zombie of afootball player dressed’ in his under-
shorts. Profanity ﬂowed ﬂuently from his anger
twisted mouth. ' ’
Victim of Circumstance .

Somebody had been looking out of the window
of this room with ﬁeld glasses. The subject under
observation seemed to be his girl. The girl was
quite upset. There she was, sittingiin front of an
open window with the curtains parted,’ with only
her short nighty to cover her, and some horrible
boys were looking across the quadrangle at her
with field glasses!

As I melted down the wall into the wastepaper-
basket behind the door, I could see that her foot-

\

 

ball boyfriend was obviously disturbed too. .‘‘I don't
want you looking out the window at my. girl!” he
rather forcefully asserted to the quaking lad he
was holding upside down. “I know there are some
pretty’ good shows out there,” he continued. “I’ve
Watched them myself. Just keep your eyes off
my girl.”

This incident brought a question to my mind -
to look, or not to look. Actually, I haven’t had
much of an opportunity to judge the quality of the’

mitory. I’ve had two rooms .in Holland Hall, one
facing the book store air conditioner and the other
facing the cross of the First UP Church on Fifth
Avenue. I do, however, have a vivid imagination,
and can understand the problem facing the male

T’oli Sci 3 To Replace
1-2 Courses This Fall

('Editor’s note: In the next

few weeks The Pitt News will

feature a series of articles about little known or new courses at
the University. The first of this series‘ will be devoted to Political
Science 3, a new course inithe political science department.)

Political Science 3 provides an introduction to some of.

the crucial ideas, questions and problems involved in man’s
attempt to achieve order, justice, and welfare in political

society.

Emphasis is placed on the analysis of the ideas, institu-
tions, and processes associated with modern democratic po-

litical systems. Examples are notb

only taken from our own govern-

ment, but also from the govern-

ments of other countries.

, Dr. Morris Ogul is lecturer in
Political Science 3 for this tri-
mester, and Dr. Edward Cooke
will lecture in the spring. They
will be aided by graduate assist-
ants. x

Because it is still on an.experi—
mental basis, only about 85 stu-
dents are enrolled» at the present
time. A limited number is also
expected this summer, butyin-
creased enrollment is expected for
the fall.

Political Science 1 and ‘2 are
still in existence this year but
will be dropped completely by
September. "

The ﬁve books which will be
used in the course are still sub-
ject to modiﬁcation. These in-
clude “The Governing of Men,”
“The Supreme Court and Fun-
damental Freedoms,” “The Pub-
lic Philosophy,” and “The Dec-
laration of Independence and the
Constitution.”

Students will also be provided
with a" reading list from which
they can select any book and write
an essay on the major theme Of
that book. ‘

For example, it would be a,very easy thing‘ to teach poetry
and nzusic right along with plzysics. Stuclents, instead of rnerely
being called upon to recite in physics class, would instead be
required to rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tunes
-—like, for insta.nce,_ The Colonel Bogey Morclz. Thus recitations
would ‘not only be chock-full'fof important facts but would, at
the same time, expose the student to the aesthetic delights of

I .WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIDE RULE

(Had) the (ii;-tinguished board

chairman (Ralph “Hot-Lips” Sigafoos) of one of our most
important American corporations (the Arf M echanical Dog Co.)
wrote a trenchant article in which he pinpoint-ed our gra\’est
natiomrl problem: the lack of culture among science graduates.

Mr. Siga-foos’s article, it must be emphasized, was in no sense
derogatory. He stated quite clearly that the science student,
what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, math, and chem-
istry, can hardly be expected to ﬁnd time to study the arts
too.iWhat Mr. Sign-foos deplores~indeed, what we all deplore
-—is the lopsided result of today’s science courses: graduates
who can build a bridge but can’t compose a concerto, who know
Pla.nck’s Constant but not Botticelli’s Venus, who are familiar
with l*‘raunhofcr’s lines but not with Schillcﬂs. »

Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this hideous imbalance.
I, however, believe there is one—-and a very simple one. It is
this: if students of science don’t have time to come to the arts,
then we must let the arts come‘ to students of sciczzce.

well-rounded education,” he
said, “not only in the ﬁeld of
journalism but in economics,
political science, and history.”

Following the science writer’s

The University of Pittsburgli
Press has announced the publica-
tion of the “History of Education,”
a journal serving as the official
magazine of the History of Edu-
cation Society.

Articles appearing in the journal '

will concern the history of edu-
cational policies, educational in»
stitutions, and related ﬁelds.

“The journal will be con-
structed, both in subject mate-
rial and in style, so that it will
have instrinsic value to all per-
sons connected with the ﬁeld of
education," said Dr. Ryland W.
Crary, associate professor of ed-
ucation at the University, and
editor of the Quarterly.

The Quarterly is the first. in a

series of scholarly journals plan-V

The Panther matmen will

this weekend as they defend
their share of the Eastern In-

Penn State, will be pulling a ma-

Nealson vs Martin

Richard Martin, who was run-
ner-up at 123-pounds last year,
looms as the favorite this year.
Martin ran through his regular
season opposition in easy style, 9-0,
with one exception. That excep-
tion was Larry Nealson of Syra-
cuse. " Nealson should provide
Martin with his toughest trouble
in Easterns also.

In 1959 Larry Lauchle won
the Eastern title at 130 pounds,
but last year he was runner-up
to Mike Leta of Rutgers. Leta
will probably be wrestling at
137 pounds so Lauchle should
again be the favorite. He will
receive tough competition from
Tony Scordo of Penn State and
Dick Janish of Rutgers. I

The 137 pound class may be
,,.the toughest of the tournament.
Raryl Kelvington will have to be
at his best to win or at least du-
plicate his second place ﬁnish of
last year. Besides Leta, the Pan-
ther can expect trouble from Dan

By ED HOWARD

Six swimmers from Ben Grady’s
Panther team head for Princeton
tomorrow for_ the Eastern College
Individual Invitational Champion-
ships. .The meet will run from
Thursday through Saturday reve-
ning.

As the name suggests, there
will be no team competition, only
events for individual swimmers
and relay teams. «

“We missed the Eastern Re-
lays in December,” said Grady,
“because they were held during
our examination period. This will
be the only chance for the boys
to meet all the top eastern swim-
mers at once.”

38 Teams

And just about every swimming
school of any stature will be re-
presented at the New Jersey meet.
Thirty—eight teams, including the
cream of eastern swimming, are
sending units to enter the com-
petition.

With that calibre of.opp_osi-
tion, all that Grady would say

about his boys’ chances was that
“some of them twill be in the

Grady is taking with him Bart
Haas, ‘Dick Rush, Carl Warnes,
Jerry Solinger, Kevin Keller and
Tony Sarsﬁeld. All these will be

Strongest Chance
zBut the Panthers’ strongest
chance of grabbingoff a ﬁrst place

edge out several good teams. '

“Several schools have record-
ed times well under four min-

Grady, “but I.-won’t know until
we get there just who’s com-
peting against whom.”

No matter what the opposition,

Harrisonﬂhapes Mat Card

Dixie’s gift to Skyscraper U. is
a crew cut Virginian from Nor-
folk named Jim Harrison, a mus-
cular sophomore who has had a
big hand in’ shaping the Panthers’
wrestling success this year.

This weekend, at the Eastern
championships, Jim hopes to
make his biggest contribution yet.
He will have the added advan-
tage of wrestling at his natural
weight of 157 pounds. Jim has
been wrestling in heavier weight
classes because of the Cats’ weak-
ness in these categories.

Jim will need to be at his best

“because the competition promises
to be tough. The» main obstacles

in his path to the title are Al -,

Marion of Cornell and Kirk Pen-
dleton of Lehigh.
Marion Defends Crown

Marion is the defending cham-
pion but may ﬁnd himself in the
role of underdog to Pendleton.

Though only a sophomore, the Le- ‘

Whoever ﬁnishes on top at
Easterns is a good bet to rule
as’157-pound king for the next
two seasons.

Winning titles is nothing new
to Harrison. Wrestling for'Gran-

Schools in Norfolk, he won the
state championship three times.
As a member of the Panther
frosh, be compiled a 5-0 record
and was the 167-pound champion
at the West Point Invitational
Tournament.

Five for Four

The most remarkable fact about
Harrison’s freshman season was

to get his weight down to 157. ’

that he compiled his 5-0 mark
in only four meets. Against Cali-
fornia State Teachers he took to
the mat twiceiand on both occa-
sions he pinned his opponent.
Despite his collegiate success,

Jim still considers winning the
State championship in his
Senior year his greatest thrill.
He had been hurt eight days
before the meet and was told
by doctors that he couldn’t
wrestle for three weeks.

Jim paid no heed to the doctors
and won the title by scoring a
pin in the ﬁrst period.

Jim Harrison is a mighty tough
man and the opposition had bet-
ter beware. And win or lose at
Easterns, the Panther sophomore
will be a strong man to contend
with for the next two seasons. -

Becoming Known as Holler Guy

Matulevic To Guard -* B

Third For Cat Zllitters.

By JIM O’BRIEN .. ..

Stationeduat the doorway to the Field House in the eve-
ning, Jerry Matulevic performs-his boring task as security

guard. He must keep outsiders
ing and stealing anything.

from sneaking into the build-

Coach Bobby Lewis also has Jerry posted at third base
on his diamond nine and hopes that the curly-haired senior

is as adept at preventing anyoneﬁ

from stealing an extra base. Lewis
is banking on the “hot corner”
resident to lead his young squad
to a winning season.

As captain, Matulevic has to in-
still the ﬁghting spirit in his fel-
low players and keep them on
the ball. His credentials label him
worthy of the charge. His attitude
and spirit remind one of the Pi-
rate’s ﬁery Don Hoak who guards
the same terminal. '

“He has all the assets of a ﬁne
third baseman,” Lewis remarked.
“He rides the other guys to do
better, yet he is real tough on
himself. He’s a real'holler guy.
I think his parents wind him up in
the morning and he just runs all
day.”

_ Has All Assets

Although Jerry came out for
the team on his own, he was not
awed by the veteran members
of the club when he arrived.
One day he was running winds
sprints, and he noticed one par-
ticular player who seemed to
be loaﬁng. , l

The player in question was Fred
DeLost, a rugged, senior catcher
who was captain of the squad at
the time. “Come on 01’ man. Let’s
hustle,” Matulevic taunted. De-
Lost snarled back, “You’re only
a .rookie, kid. When you make the
club, you can talk to me.”

Coach Recalls Incident

Lewis remembers that Jerry
never said a word for about ﬁve
days after that. “That’s the only
time,” the coach recalled “that
he’s been quiet since.”

Last year, however, Jerry’s
bat was silenced after he had
showed great promise as a ﬁrst
year man with a .326 average.
It dipped to a mere .200, and
Jerry is still smarting over the
mediocre percentage. “He’s the
last kid to make excuses,” Lewis
added, “but he had a lot of bad
breaks last season.”

“No kidding, but every time we
played in a ﬁeld where there
were wide open spaces, he would
really blast away, but the out-
ﬁelders could go way back and
camp under the ball.”

Recalling twoilong shots that
Matulevic uncorked last season,
Lewis swears that they both

Baseball Team
Topic of Talk
At Field House

,lt’s only the middle of
spring training, and already
the Panther baseball team

has struck fear into the

hearts of their fellow sports-_

men. Although they have yet
to play a single game, their line
drive, richocheting blasts are the

hottest’ topic of discussion in the,
'Field House.

It seems that any misguided
missiles or ﬁelding lapses en-
danger the health of the track-
men or other athletes who tread
shaken ground. “It’s only. an oc-

cupational hazard,” grinned Coach
Bobby Lewis. Lewis himself is all ,

too anxious to abandon the con-
ﬁnes of the sports arena, but the
marsh bogs of the practice ﬁelds
prevent it. -

On Friday, the diamond men
had the opportunity to use the
football ﬁeld for their ﬁrst ven-
ture outdoors. “We worked out
some actual_ game situations,”
Lewis commented. ‘flt was a little
soggy, but it was the best we’ve
had-so far. There is no substitute
for actual games.”

But as long as the intermit-
tent showers continue to keep
the boys indoors, they will have
to content themselves to the
grudging routine workouts that
have been on their daily sched-
ule thus far.

When the prospects arrive after
classes, they begin by looseing
up, throwing the ball around.
Then Lewis arrives and conducts
calesthenics, which are followed
by rigorous drills designed to im-
prove coordination, timing, and
agility. V

Lewis conducts inﬁeld practice
later, and sends each player into
the batting cage to take some
practice swats. at the servings that
the pitchers send their way.

With the month of April arriv-
ing next on the calendar, pros-
pects aren’t too hot that the Cat.
nine will desert the Field House
soon.

Timmons Claims
Hoop Recruiting;
Critic Silenced

By TED COLTON .
- Sports Editor

..

 

In my last column titled “Basketball Seen as Minor Sport at
University,” which appeared in last Wednesday's edition of the Pitt
News, I accused the athletic department of not wanting to win at
basketball. I still maintain that position.

It seems that my article has created a situation far beyond my
It is also true that there were several instances I cited
which were not altogether true.

The reason, I wrote the arti_cle was that I would like to see Pitt
have a representative team in the roundball sport, something that
has happened only one out of three years that I have attended Pitt.

In a letter addressed to me, Panther basketball coach Bob
Timmons states: “The truth I will accept, untruths, and inac-
curacies as printed in your column on Wednesday, March 1st, I
cannot accept.” ' -

Coach Timmons goes on to explain that he did see Howard Lock-
hart play in a tournament in Kentucky, and that a Pitt graduate had
scouted both Lockhart and Darwin Smith. Timmons’ letter states:
“They were not scouted by Radio as your source of information would
have you believe.” ‘

Secondly Timmons states the case of Don Hennon. “Don Hennon
was contacted by me personally at Wampum High School. Invited
him to visit Pitt, and sold Pitt by Dr. "Dick Deitrick then in medical
school. Dick took Don to classes with him, -and sold Pitt to Don.
Don Hennon, and Dr. Dick Deitrick will verify these facts if you care
to investigate, and authenticate the true facts.”

I will have to say to Coach Timmons that my source of
information on this point DID. come from the horse’s mouth and
not from any other part of the anatomy, despite what Mr.
Timmons would like to believe.

The third point of the letter is on Ben Jinks, of whom I stated in
"my column, “And Jinks ‘was recruited by Vic Fusia, former football
coach.” Timmons writes, “The lead on Ben Jinks was furnished by
Vic Fusia but not recruited by Vic Fusia, as I drove to East Meadow,

talked with Ben and his family, invited him to Pitt, and Julius Peguesi

then Assistant Freshman Coach sold Ben on Pitt.”

Timmons’ fourth and ﬁnal point reads, “The biggest inaccuracy
of all is your statement ‘The Athletic Department does not care if
they have a winning basketball team or not.’ As a coach I have
always prepared "my Teams to win, and done all in my power to aid

1 them in winning. I would sure like you to prove the above statement

with facts.”

I would like to say that to prove my statement,_l[ will just
need several ﬁgures: 10-14 -— 11-14 — 12-11. If the athletic de-
partment does care if Pitt has a winning basketball team, I don’t
believe that they are doing a very good job in producing one.

On the more current side of the sports news, Rex Peery will
be taking his wrestling team to the Easterns over the weekend, and
the Panther matmen are bound to be the most unpopular team at
the tournament. The 1961 Easterns are being held at Lehigh.

A few weeks back the Panthers spoiled Lehigh’s bid for an
undefeated season. Lehigh was ranked number two in the country
and on paper they should have handed the Panthers a beating. But
such was not the case.

If you are not familiar with the wrestling situation at
Lehigh, these facts will enlighten you. They take their wrestling
seriously — their number one foe is Pitt —— they hold Rex Peery
in the highest regard as a wrestling coach but the greatest thrill
they get out of life is beating one of Peery’s teams.

So the matmen will be in for two days of rough going at Lehigh.
Their chances of copping the tournament are a little under .500.
Lehigh is the team to beat with Penn State, Rutgers, Pitt and Army
making a run of it. _ I ~-

John Zolikoﬁ is the Panther’s lone defending champ but he will
be an underdog in the 147 pound division. He may be seeded second,
third or even fourth. Dick Martin will probably be seeded ﬁrst at
123 pounds and Larry Lauchle the same. at 130. Daryl Kelvington,
Jim Harrison and Bob Guzik should also be seeded but Lehigh still

Traclcmen Compete  IC4/1 
Championships at New York

Rees Takes 13 Men to Gardens
Saturday For Top Track Meet

By JACK SMITH
A capacity crowd of 17,000 is expected to jam into Mad-
ison Square Garden Saturday for the IC4A track champion-
ships. Coach Carl Rees will take a 13 man squad to repre-
sent the Panthers in their ‘biggest indoor competition of

the year. .

Rees plans to use his ﬁve relay men in ‘the individual

races in the afternoon. If two orO
_of reaching the ﬁnals.

more members of the relay team
make the ﬁnals, Rees will scratch
his mile-relay quartet from com-
petition at night. 0

“I want to give each member
of the squad a chance to perform,”
Rees said. “Several members of
the relay team stand a good
chance of placing in the ﬁnals of
the individual events.”

Sophomore Vance Carter ap-
pears to be the Panther’s top
contender for a win in the races.
Carter will enter the 600-yard
run, a race he has only run once
this year. He easily won the
event in a dual meet against
Army in 1:13.1. His time, how-
ever, is only fair considering
Bob Stack’s time of 1:11 in Yale
performances. Stack has won
the IC4A _600-yard run for two
consecutive years.

Bob Shanafelt and Steve Munter
will enter the 60-yard dash. The
two sophomores placed one-two
respectively in 6.5 seconds in dual
meets with Navy and Harvard
this year. Either man is capable

Hoop Playoffs
Started in IM c

All—campus playoffs in two
sports begin this week as the
University’s winter intramural
program draws to a close. Cham-

pions will be determined in bas- _

ketball and bowling during the
next two weeks. _

Two games were scheduled
yesterday in the_basketball play-
off, but the tournament gets into
full swing tomorrow, with four
top contests slated to be played.

In the outstanding games, the
Gunners of the American League
take on 2nd-seeded Dental Frosh,
winners of the Big Eight. Other
frays show the Dental Sophs
against the Darts, Theta Chi
meeting Pi Kappa Alpha, and the
Goyids versus the Champs.

The Colts, top team in the
Bio-Chem ‘League and seeded
ﬁrst in the tourney, wil swing
into action next week.

In the All-campus bowling
playoffs, six teams will battle it
out for top honors. They include:
Mechanical and Civil. Engineers,
Groovers, Delta Sigma, Phi Epsi-
lon, and the Fighting Dagoes. ’

Also, the University’s foul
shooting contest, complete with
prizes, is now in progress. Any-.
one interested may call Dave
Starrett at the Field House, Ext.
671. .

Tennis Schedule
To Begin April 8*
Coach Bill Summers expects one‘

when his tennis team begins their
15 game schedule on April 8.

Among the teams the Panthers
have slated to play are Penn State,
Navy, West Virginia and For Lee.

The team has been holding daily
Workouts. “Remember,” Summers
cautioned his squad, “the team is
only as strong as its weakest
member. Don’t you be that weak
member.”

Rees plans to run Bill Hinch—

lay team, in either the 600 or

tice,” Rees said, “and could turn
out to be the biggest surprise of
all.” Reed Clarke will enter the
1,000—yard run also.

The best bet for top honors in

Only Defending Champ

John Zolikoﬁ is the Blue and
Gold’s 0111:,’ defending champion.
‘The Junior from Erie won in an
upset last year and if he is to win
this year it will require another
upset. He has already been beaten
by Mike Natvig of Army. Le-
high’s Bob Gunst should also give
Zolikefl plenty of trouble.

Jim Harrison will move down
to 157 pounds for Easterns. The
Sophmore star has been wrest-
ling at 167 pounds and higher
all year. Defending champion Al
Marion of Cornell and Lehigh’s
great Kirk Pendleton are two
who will try to roadblock Har-
rison’s championship desires.

At 167, 177 and 191 pounds the
Panthers have no title aspirants.
Augie Arrigone, Paul Wilson and
Bill Robb respectively, will han-
dle these spots for the Cats.

However any win that these
three pick up could help the Pan-
ther’s cause greatly. Without Len
V'uocolo’s solo win last year the
Cat’s .couldn’t have tied Penn
State. ~ .

Bob Guzik will have to work
hard to duplicate his third place
showing of last year. The big

senior has the ability to go all the 3

way but he must face tough com-
petition in doing so. Defending
champion Johnston Oberly, Army’s
Dick Kuzns and Don Grifﬁth will
provide Guzik with plenty of
headaches.

The matmcn will need a su-
preme eflfotrt from all participants
to bring home their fifth title in
eight years.

Assistant Coach Bill Summers and the Panthers’ top four
squash players, Dave O’Loug'n1in, Joe Brown, Ralph Mason
and Bill Hinkel climaxed the racquet season in ﬁne style.
These four men got the best results of any Blue and Gold
team to compete in the National Singles Tournament.

Outstanding was Mason who captured first place in the
consolation championship. In hisO--~

Dave had to play Ken Illik of
Trinity, of whom the Panthers
remarked, "He could scrape a ball
off the sidewalk.” Steve Vehslage
of Princeton, the tourney‘s num-
ber one seeded player defeated
Dave in three games.

Brown, unseeded and in a_
tough bracket conquered Jay
Hyland of Navy in straight
games. In his second match,
however, he ran into Prin.ceton’s
Jim Zug, unbeaten in varsity
competition.

In ‘a first round match, Hinkel
lost to Army’s second ranked
racquetman, Don Voss. In the con-
solation round Bill was defeated
by a much more experienced Jim
Botts. On the consolation game
coach Summers stated, “Although
Bill was beaten 3 games to 1, it
was one of his best matches of
his college career.”

Although squash takes a back
seat, and rightly so, to major

University so well.
