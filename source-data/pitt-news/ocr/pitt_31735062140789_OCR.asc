Your column could accomplish a‘

This ‘note is not intended as a

Low Hurdle Champ makes high hurdle from track star to track coach

Panther Baseball Sessions  
Sparlked by Pira tes' Butcher

By CHUCK BAUER ,

Baseball. practice held Wednes-
day and Thursday was characteriz-
_ed by the appearance of Big Max
Butcher, ace right-hander of the
Pittsburgh Pirates. Max pitched to
the Panther candidates during
hunting drills. He was extremely
impressed by the conditions of Mit-
terling Field and seemed to beneﬁt
greatly from the two practice ses-
sions. Both Coach Mitterling and
the squad were pleased by his ap-
pearance. Butcher leaves for the
Pirates trainring: camp at Muncie,
Indiana, March 24.

The Jungle Cats are still plagued
by a lack of candidates. Fourteen
players attended the Thursday
drill, but a few were freshmen.
Mitterling seems to be assured of
a good varsity backstop since
there are four upperclassmen and
six freshmen trying for catcher.
Other. notables were lettermen Ed
Fisher and Bill McKee, second
baseman and pitcher respectively.
Bill Kostenbader, only other re-
turning varsity diamond star, has
as yet failed to attend any of the
practices. Kostenbader was the
other half of the keystone combi-
nation of the ’42 baseballers.

Others. who thus far are regular-
ly attending the practices are Red
Pattersion, first baseman; Bob Mc-

  xmn    
 DRAWN STEEL   C0.

lice and Len Kuntz, inﬁelders; Ed

Citron, John Moschetti, Bill Brown
and All Corrado, outﬁelders; and
pitcher Ed Citron. The most recent
addition to the squad is Matt
Gebel,-fugitive fullback from Bow-

ser’s gridders.

If the University decides to re-
voke the freshmen rule,.Coach Mit-
terling will be presented with a
novel problem. In all probability,
every freshman that ever lifted a
glove or bat will pester Mitterling
for aposition on the team. The
frosh will have to be weeded out,
and only the most promising boys
accepted. The practice sessions will
undoubtedly be divided, since the
upperclassmen will have a start on
the frosh, and Mitterling will not
want to hinder them with the
weeding out process. i ’

Swimming Party Held
For Freshman Women

A swimming party will be held
for freshman women at t-he down-
town YMCA on Thursday after-
noon, March 18, from 3:30 to 5:30.
o’clock. The party is un.der the di-
rection of Garnet Mc-‘Marlin, C45.

She will be assisted by Grace
Gauter, swimming manager, who
has arranged a swimming program
and other entertainment. Refresh-
ments will be served. All newly
entered freshman women are re-
quested to attend.

That the University has no in-
tention of dropping track from its
sports program was a fact definite-
ly borne out today by. the an-
nouncement that Harold J. “Hap”
Stickel had been appointed head
track .coach. Stickel who ranks as
thebest low hurdler in University
history, succeeds Carl Olson, now
a Lieutenant.-Commander in the
Navy.

The new track coach will com-
bine school with coaching, for he is
‘a student in the School of Engi-
neering. Originally scheduled to
graduate last June, Sticke-l’s switch
from a Business Administration.
course to Engineering cost him one
more year of school,

Stickel was IC4A indoor sprint
champion in 1940. He holds the Uni-
versity record in the 60-yard low
hurdles and he won the IC4Ai220-
yard low hurdles title in 1940-41.
_I-Iepalso holds the world record in
the 45-yard dash, a record set in
a. Knights pf Columbus n1e,et_,”‘.ln
the CIC “meet last «year ,heVbroke
the" 75-yard dash record in 7:5,
won the 60-yard low" hurdles for
the second consecutive year, and
won the -outdoor 220 low hurdle
witha. mark of 23:4.‘ For’ his
achievements in this meet he was
awarded the coveted Nicholson
trophy. This, incidentally, marked
‘the first time that the Nicholson
cup had been given to an eastern
pe'rformer'.. ' B '

In the; National AAU meet re-
cently he set a new record in the
low hurdles with a mark of 6:9.
In two other instances hard luck
robbed him of ‘additional honors
and titles. He «had an eight yard
lead over his nearest opponent in
the ﬁnals hurdles in the National
Collegiates two years ago, only to
trip just before the ﬁnish. Approxi-
mately the same thing happened to
him last year in that samemeet.

Track seems to run in the Stick-
el family. “Hap’s” father, Charles-
Stickel, was a track star at both
Carlisle and Dickinson Colleges
and for many years held the record
tor the 100-yard dash.

The new track coach has also
had some experience as a football
player. For three years he was a
‘member of the Pitt team. Unfor-
tunately his position was that of
left ha.l:t'-back and the University
already had a. very capable left"
halt‘-back in the person of Edgar
"Specia1~Delivery”— Jones. ' ‘

Stickel was married last year to
Dorothy Weber, the daughter of
the University’s secretary, John
Weber. - ‘
’ He shared the title of “The
Bridegroom Twins” with Bill Car-
ter who was married at the same
time. _ .
Up to the time of Stickel’-s ap-
pointment there had been doubt as
to the continuance of track. How'-
ever, since February members of
the track team. havepbeen oprafct-ic;
mg“ in the. indoor track hou-_se_ and

Stickel had been helping ._out,.'. Plans: 

nowcall for the Universityto com-
pete in the Penn State meet, the
_lC4A’s, the Army meet, and the
Penn Relays. - - ‘ ' » -

Stickel will have a high mark to
shoot at in the record of his,-ex-
coach. Under Carl Olson, Pitt broke
all precedents in the 1939 Penn
Relays, by capturing four relay
titles and his boys now. hold all
but four of the «University track
and ﬁeld records. Olson left the
University this summer. to enter
the Navy".

Alldred Room
Lists New Books

By CATHERINE KENYON .
Several books of current impor-

nfliance and interest have been add-

ed to the Alldred Room. “These
new books will help students to
understand present problems,” said
Mrs. H. F. Dice, rlibrarian.

One of the most important books
is'.“Siberia” by Emil Lengyel. It
gives a graphic description of Si-
beria yesterday and today. of the
great’ explorers and merchants
that made the progress of that
section of the world. Mr. Lengyel
writes from ﬁrst-hand experience
in the North. At the age of twen-
ty, he was taken a prisoner of war
and was imprisoned in Siberia. “Si-
beria is important to America at
the present because of its nearness
to Alaska, and its relations to our
possession,” Miss Dice asserted.

Another book of non-ﬁction

«which is worth student attention is

the Borkin and Welsh “Germany’s

’ Master Plan.” This is a new inter-

pretation of inside Germany. Also
new is Shalom Rizk’s autobiogra-
phy, “Syrian Yankee.” For wit,
“How to Write” by Stephen Lea-
cock is highly recommended by
Mrs. Dice. “The reader‘who knows
Mr. Leacock will appreciate his
style.” “This Modern Music,” by
John Tasher Howard, will improve
many a mind on the subject of
modern music and its appreciation.
According to the writer, modern
music is only appreciated when it
is understood. Reading this book
will improve the understanding of

, the lay musician. ,

Outstanding new novel, accord-
ing to Mrs. Dice, is one of local
interest. “Valley of Decision” by
Martha Davenport. It deals with a
Pittsburgh steel family, their loves
and achievements.

A be mailed to the_Red Cross office immediately, Dr. J. Ellwood

ﬁnance, and Dr. Ford Curtis,
associate professor of English, co_-
chairman of the drive, announced
today. ‘

The drive was originally sched-
uled to open March 1, but as the
ofﬁ _ial Red Cross insignias had not
yet been distributed, the opening
was postponed to last Tuesday.

No personal solicitation will be
used in the faculty drive. Each
member of the faculty and the em-
ployees of the University have been
mailed a subscription sheet, which
they are urged to fill out and re-
turn along with the contribution to
the office. . E

In previous years Falk Clinic
and the Mellon Institutes returns
have been combined with the Uni-
versity’s in Compiling the aggre-
gate returns. This year, however,
the faculty’s contribution will be
listed separately." This means that
the University collection this year
will have about 500 less contribut-
ors,” said Dr. Amos. The contribu-
tions this year so far have been
very generous, due to the added
war time needs of the organiza-
tion.
