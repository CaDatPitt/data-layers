Library preserves historic mining maps

by Anthony Brino
For T be Pitt New

Pitt’s nearly 20-year relationship
with Consol Energy Inc. reached a
new level when the coal company
granted the University thousands
of dollars to maintain its historic
coal maps.

Over the next five years, Consol
Energy Inc will give the University
Library System $100,000 to pre-
serve  document the company’s
regional mining maps, some . of
which date back to the 18503.

The state'Department of Envi-

ronmental Protection promised to

give the University Library System

$75,000, and the US. Department»

of the Interior Office of Surface

 pledged to give $25,000.
Officially called the Consol Energy _

Mine Map -Preservation Project,
the endeavor began in 2007 and in-
cludes 700 maps.

The project is ongoing, might
require more funding and has not
set a completion date, said Pitt pres-
ervationist Amy Baker, who special-

izes in paper conservation. She said

Katz ranks
among best

in world

by Mike Ploetz
Staff Writer

Pitt’s graduate business program
is one of the best in the world, ac-
cording to a new survey.

Pitt’s Joseph M. Katz Gradu-
ate School of Business ranked
ninth nationally and 25th interna-
tionally for its master’s' of busi-
ness administration program. The
survey evaluated more than 150
business schools throughout the
world.

We've always known we pro-

vide a high-quality environ-

recognition.

The rankings are based on in-
formation the Financial Times, a
European news organization
similar to The Wall Street Jour-
nal, compiled between July 2008
and the end of last year.

Laurie Kirsch, senior associate
dean of the Katz Business School,
said, “We’ve always known we
provide a high—quality environ-
ment, but it’s nice to have that rec-
ognition.”

Other Pennsylvania institutions
that have high—ranking master’s
of business administration pro-
grams include the University of
Pennsylvania, which was ranked
first internationally; Carnegie
Mellon University, which ranked

24th internationally; and Penn-

sylvania State University, which
ranked 34th internationally.

by Kelly Thomas
Staﬁ’ Writer

Jeff Gleim wants to reconnect
Pitt alumni to campus.

So, as the new head of alumni
relations, Gleim will host events

aimed at bringing together the.

Universitfs alumni and current

‘ students;

.Gleim, who served as inter-
im associate vice chancellor for
alumni relations and executive
director of Pitt Alumni Relations
since August, brought what his
colleagues considered a fresh per-
speclive to the way Pitt interacts
with alumni. 4 ~

“He came in here and hit the
ground running,” said Al Novak,

vice chancellor of institutional
advancement, the office that over-
sees alumni relations.

Gleim, who became the
head of alumni relations earlier
this month, started several new
events. He said ‘he hopes to con-
tinue some of them, including the
Alumni -Barbeque held in con-

. junction with the Panther Club at

Heinz Field last August. Chancel-
lor Mark l\-Iordenberg and several
coaches gave speeches. Fireworks
followed. _ ‘

Gleim said the event drew
more than 2,500 people and got
them excited about the upcoming
football season. He expects the
event to grow in the future.

to the Department of Environmental Protec-

tion, said Baker. Rougeux could, not be reached
for comment, not could Consol Energylnc.

After the maps are interpreted, treated
and deemed usable, the department takes

‘them to the National Mine Map Reposi-

tory in nearby Green Tree where they are
digitally archived, said 4 assistant Univer-
sity Librarian Michael ' Dabrishus, who
helped secure funding for the project.
After digitization, the Department of En-
vironmental Protection will place the maps in
an extensive database on its Web site, where
users can search‘ for speciﬁc information per-
taining to a certain site or year and navigate
through mines that once existed or still exist in
different regions, towns and cities, said Dabri-
shus. A
The department hopes to catalog every
mine that ever existed  the state, said Baker.
The physical maps will eventually sitin the li-
brary archives at the Preservation Department,
which is about three miles east of Oakland.
Both ‘Baker and Dabnshus noted that
their interest in the project was inﬂuenced
by the 2002 Quecreek Mine accident in
Somerset county, during which ‘nine min-
ers spent three days trapped underground
after unintentionally drilling into an aban-
doned mine that I ﬂooded with water.
Baker, who earned her master’s degree

P digitized, sent to library

in library and information sciences from
the University of Texas at Austin, said she
ﬁnds it rewarding to be involved in a proj-
ect that could prevent future accidents
by providing miners with accurate maps.
Baker, a Pittsburgh native who was hired
speciﬁcally for the Consol project in 2007,
said the factvthat her great—grandfather was
a coal miner added a special genealogical ele-
ment and personal connection to her work.

While the use of coal predates other fos-
sil fuels like oil, it is still a major source of
employrnent'and‘energy in Pennsylvania and
around the country. Consol employs 2,285
people in Pennsylvania, most of them in the
state’s southwest region. ~

And though often cited as a major pol-
lutant and contributor to global warming,
coal generates almost half of the counttyfs
electricity, according to statistics from the
U.S. . Energy Information Administration.

_ Dabrishus said he is proud of Pitt’s involve-

ment in the project and noted. tha°t he and
Con_sol expect society to beneﬁt from the
maps’ digitization and _the information they
reveal. '

He said the maps could aid in construction,

engineei_;ing  geological planning‘ projects.
Knowing the location of old, abandoned

mines is integral to safety in public panning,’

he said.

they should approve a Facebook ad, too.

Devanath agreed
“If [the event] is educational, we should at

she said “I think if we them the Facebook

students because it’s on for a full week. I urge the
board to give them one of each.” —

undecided about which one would be better for
us,” she said. “But in reconsidering it, with our

things, be a little more diverse in the events
we offer,” said Gleim. “We’re trying to be
more things to more people.”

Gleim said he also hopes to continue
hosting homecoming celebrations on cam-
pus, which include the Homecoming Wel-
come Back Reception for Alumni. Gleim
said the event, held for the ﬁrst time on
campus rather than at Heinz Field this year,
drew more people than ever before.

“I’m all about focusing on tradition and
getting people to come back to campus,”
he said. “We essentially took over the Ca-
thedral for the night.”

Gleim also started Alumni Day for men’s
basketball last month, where alumni were
welcomed as special guests to the game and
given commemorative gifts. The University
will hold an Alumni Day for women’s bas-
ketball Friday, and Gleim said he hopes to
start one for football next year.

“We are about building relationships for
the University,” said Gleim.

He said that the Alumni Association,
which works with clubs and representatives
from around the country, wants to foster
involvement and tradition with the current
student body as well as with graduates, be-
cause both are “the lifeblood of the Uni-
versity.” He added that he wants current
students to leave feeling proud of Pitt.

“Without students we would be lost,” he
said. “Once they’re gone, they’re gone.”

Gleim said that keeping students in-
volved after graduation is important.

“Many of these alum and supporters
are the ones who encourage their kids and
neighbors to go to Pittsburgh, to live or for
school.”

Novak said that Gleim’s attitude repre-
sents Pitt well.

“He’s direct and honest, so you know
what the facts are,” said Novak. “He empa-
thizes. He’s welcoming.”

He’s hands-on, often taking the time to
individually greet alumni as they arrive at
events, said Novak.

Gleim’s nature, Novak said, has allowed
him to build bonds with his staff and with

than a decade, Gleim worked in politics
with the Office of the Speaker of the Ohio
House of Representatives for nine years.
After Ohio instituted term limits and the
speaker left, Gleim wasn’t needed anymore,
he said.

“So I had to go find new employment,”
said Gleim. “The opportunity to work at
Ohio State really fell into my lap.”

Gleim has lived in Pittsburgh for about
two years now and said his only problem
has been navigating.

“I think the city is beautiful,” he said. “I
love the diversity of it. It’s a little difficult to
maneuver because of the rivers.

vented it thinking of Pittsburg .”

Competency exam plan
doesn't make the grade

High school graduates  to
college simply aren’t prepared to be
there Of about 62,000 recent gradu-
ates now attending Pennsylvania State
System of Higher Education schools,
morethan20,000hadtotakeremedial
courses in  school-level 
according to a report from the Perm-
sylvania Department of ' Education.

a The report breaks down the costs
of these remedial courses to students
and taxpayers and concludes that

more than $26 million are spent on '

coursework that students should be
learning in  school Pennsylvania
Gov Ed Rendell has a solution: gradu-
ation competency exams

Under Rendell’s plan, which he
has been pressing since eady 2007,
students would be  to pass six
of 10 graduation competency exams
to graduate The tests would cover a
variety of   rnath-
ematics, English, science and social
studies I

Ostensibly the purpose of these
tests is to ensure that students have
mastered the core skills of  school
before they move on to college or to
join the workforce But there are a
number of problems with the pro-
posal that make it all but completely
unworkable.

Most  is the amount of
money it would cost the state to pre-
pare and administer the examinations
Each test — except for one nationally
devised algebra exam —— would cost
about $5 million to  totaling
$45 million for nine exams I

Add in an additional $9 million to
seek and review proposals from test-
 companies and the money
it would take to administer each test
across the state, and  could

of Education itself, only costs taxpay-
ers $13.7 million in the first place .
And considering the state is al-
readyfacingabudgetdeﬁcitinexcess
of $2.3 billion, according to Rendell’s
projections, now might not be the best

time to try to institute a costiy system I

of student 

Besides the obvious ﬁscal prob-
lems, the graduation competency ex-
ams simply _aren’t a good idea. As No
Child Left Behind has reminded us
time and  measuring students by
standardized testing only encourages
schools to teach to the test, rather than
encouraging a balanced education.

. Students will spend more time prepar-

ing for tests and less time in extracur-
ricular programs or non-curriculum
education A

The tests also seem to be promot-
ingaveryparticulartypeofliberalarts
education balanced between English,
social studies, math and science, which
students who study vocational trades
or have a concentrated education plan
may ﬁnd difﬁcult Not every student
has the same post-graduation goals,
but lumping them all together as one
group to ﬁt graduation requirements
ignores that fact.

, Rather than  more stan-
dardized  that forces students
near the end of their education to
concentrate on learning the basic cur-
riculum, it would be better if the state
would increase  for early child-
hood and middle school education so
that students are prepared to learn the
subjects theyfre currentiy  be-
hind in.

It’s clear that the graduation com-
petency exams are a bloated and inef-
ﬁcient way for the state to measure
student competency. The only real
question is, why can’t the state’s leaders
see that? \

‘Rock of Love Bus' simply rocks

by Erik Hinton
Columniat

 

For the uninitiated, “Rockof Love
Bus with Bret Michaels” might seem
like some vaguely English phrase,
possibly a mistranslation of a Japa-
nese phenomenon involving cats and
no bus whatsoever. However, those
who have a special afﬁnity for Bret

Michaels, outrageous plastic surgery

or trash know that “Rock of Love .

Bus” is the third season of Poison-
front-man-turned-perpetual-bachelor
Michaels’ quest for true love

I proudly fall into the group of

fans who avidly have watched every .

episode from season one For the
past three years, without fail, when-
ever Bret and his sinfully synthetic
hair_come on screen, I pause my aca-
demic pursuits, rally my roommates
and wallow ir1 the ripest of VH1’s
celeb-reality refuse I  enjoy
the show and  pick-a-litde with

fellow “Rock of Love” enthusiasts at -

every opportunity.

I have suffered no small share of

others’ disbelief at this  af-
ﬁnity. “Surely, it’s the ironic distance

you love, right Erik?”’ Positively not.

\ Irony has long been stale and too ﬂac-

cid to even  to tickle my humor.
Before any silicone hounds accuse
me of watching the show for some
perverse aesthetic gratiﬁcation, let me
assure you that this is not the case
Unless you were raised in a strip club
and weaned on a steady diet of anime
and “Paris is Burning,” these drag—ish
painted ladies do not ﬁt your standard
of beauty.

One  has bargain—basement
implants that pop from a nasty tum-
ble Another hoards sweaty socks col-
lected from the other contestants A
third lady presents Michaels with an
unmentionable piercing as a promise

Jean Genet once told the man di-

recting a production of his play “The

Balcony,” “If anybody tells you that

you have produced this play in good
taste, you will have failed.‘ My tarts
must look like the worst prostitutes

in the world,” I can only imagine that

“Rock of Love Bus”’ creators gave
similarinstruction. ‘
However, as easy as it would be
for me to spend an entire column
 the foul virtuosity of “Rock
of Love Bus,” I am more interested

. in why the show is so popular Niels-

en reports that the season premiere
gathered 2.1 million viewers. Why, for
example, have I happily watched the
second episode three times,’ and why
have I had no trouble  my
roommates to watch with me?

The pissant intellectual answer is
that watching trashy television — and
“Rock of Love Bus” is certainly the
pinnacle —— is something like a mod-
ern Feast of Fools In medieval times,
this festival was the sole occasion on
which social roles were reversed, es-
pecially those in the church. The Feast
acted a steam valve aimed at abating
the frustrations of the feudal system.

Similarly, collegiates might be at-
tracted to “Rock of Love Bus” be-
cause it brings them low: Otherwise
crammed into thick volumes of
organic chemistry or enco to
spend afternoons arguing about Fou-
cault in coffee shops, students can

Such positions are far more dam-

way. When our relation to culture be-

Sign of Change visitor, Heather Stanco, takes a look at one of the hundreds of pieces of protest paraphernalia at CMU's Miller Gallery ,

Carnegie Mellon condensed
40 years of social unrest and ac-
tivism throughout the world into
one art gallery this month with its
latest exhibit, Signs of Change.

Signs of Change: Social Move-
ment Cultures 1960s to Now fea-
tures photos, posters, video clips
and audio clips from protests,
campaigns and activism from

39 countries across the globe
throughout the past 40 years.
The collection is on display at
Carnegie Mellon’s Miller Gallery
uritil March 8, and is guest cu-
rated by Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute PhD candidates Dara
Greenwald and josh MacPhee.
The exhibit documents social

movements, from the civil rights »

movement and hippie hey—days
of the United States to the anti-
apartheid movement in Africa

to the global AIDS movements
across the world, and serves as

decade of people assembling to
make their voices heard.

Signs of Change focuses on
the creative and artistic products
that social movements inspire,
rather than a simple’ chronicle
of photo archives. But according
to Greenwald, Signs of Change
doesn’t appeal to art aﬁcionados

Bettie gives Pittsburgh something to love

by Sarah Simkin
Staﬂ Writer

...And We’re Never Coming
Back

LoveBettie

Independent (No Record Label)
Rocks Like: Alkaline Trio with female
vocals and a bluesy edge

For music lovers whose tastes
run to the more unique end of
the alternative rock genre’s of-
ferings, LoveBettie is the hottest
band in the Pittsburgh music

scene.’

The band’s debut’ album,
...And We’re Never Coming Back, is
classic alternative rock with in-
ventive twists, creating a sound
spiked with .ﬂairs of other inﬂu-

, ences ranging from pop to blues.

The album features enticing
hooks and well—crafted melodies
as well as a solid lyrical effort
throughout, maintaining a good
standard of expression where
not profound.

The album represents a vari-
ety of composition styles, with

tempos running the gamut from
heart pounding to gentle.
There are songs for the
broken-hearted as well
as those newly in love
and much in between.
Since its founding

in 2005, LoveBettie
performed regularly‘ on
the regional Pittsburgh mu-

sic scene, experimenting with its
music before recording its debut:
for a late_ November release_in
2008. Fronted by singer and key-
boardist Alexandra Naples, sing-

 

er and guitarist C.T. Fields, bass

guitarist Matt Sharrow and

drummer Banks make
up LoveBettie.

The album
takes its title from
the forceful track

“Crumble:” “Bring
the white horse to my
door / And we’ll leave this
place / And we’re never coming
back / No we’re never coming
back.”
“Lies”. has a more folksy
sound to it, “Don’t come crawl-

Robots aren't

coming to life

quite yet

  
    

by Donald Campbell

Colummldti

Stanford announced a new

generation of artiﬁcial intelligence
technology that continues to inch
robotics closer toward self-aware-
ness.

Don’t get overly excited yet,
though. The robot is still a tad on
the simplistic side when compared
to the sentient robots of popular
culture, but the robot displays the
success of a paradigm shift in ar-
tiﬁcial intelligence that will surely

steer engineers in the right direc-

tion.

The main difference between
the new robot, called the Stanford
Artiﬁcial Intelligence Robot — or

‘STAIR for short — and previous

efforts in the realm of artiﬁcial
intelligence is the fact that STAIR
adapts and learns as it bumbles
around.

Machine learning has been

implemented before but usually ‘

as an application. or as a feature
of a large application. The trend
of programming mobile robots
capable of performing tasks and
manipulating objects is somewhat
new. ‘
STAIR is capable of respond-
ing to voice commands and re-
sponding to them by traversing
a room and.using its extendable
arms to interact with objects. It
comes complete with cameras’ and
other sensors, giving it the abil-
ity to avoid ‘objects that might or

i might not have been present the

last time it traversed an area.

The true power of machine
learning is in its scalability. The
author of the “Computerworld”
article that introduced STAIR
uses the chesstmaster computers
of the 1980s as an example. IBM’s
Deep Blue was intelligent enough
to beat human chess masters, but

ing back my way / When every _

single word "you say / Is” lies.”
Songs featuring male and female
voices in tandem are something
of a rarity in current music, mak-
ing the duet between Naples and
Fields an intriguing composition.

The lilting ballad “Blue Skied”
has a mournful lullaby vibe to it,
showcasing Naples’ soulful, vo-
cals with dreamy lyrics.

“World is Falling” has a simi-
larly ethereal dystopian feel to
it. Simultaneously the longest
track and the track with the few-
est lyrics, the song might beneﬁt
from slightly less repetition and
fewer instrumental segments but
is very easy to listen to nonethe-
less —— provided one was in an
appropriately disconsolate frame
of mind. '

“Marionette” is a song as
creepy as its namesake, with dis-
concerting echoes and hard gui-

p album is a keeper

tar riffs. The lyrics completethe
dark tableau, “Your eyes ﬂutter
by like butterﬂies / Cleansing the
sun from the skies.”

The album takes some swoops
in emotional tone, from deso-
late, “It’s hard to keep smiling /
When you feel like you’re dying,”
in “Worst of Me” to tentatively

life-affirming, “I don’t want to 

live like I don’t want to live / I
got better things to do,” in “Hon-
estly,” but maintains sincerity
throughout.

LoveBettie chose its name by
pulling words at random out of
a hat, exhibiting an affinity for
the random that can be clearly
observed in its" musical inﬂu-

ences. The style shifts from song ._

to song, deftly maneuvering out
of clear classification in a speciﬁc
niche. Through this experimenta-
tion, a clear and promising new
sound has emerged on the scene.

in history and social change as well,” she
said.. .  .
The historical aspect of the exhibition
isn’t the only focus. -

“It tells- a history but is still current,” __

said Greenwald. “There are posters for
events in 2010 that haven’t happened yet.”
Greenwald anticipates that the images
of people coming together to speak out
against injustice and challenge their gov-
ernments. will encourage the tradition of
social movement to continue. .
.“I hope people do ﬁnd it more inspir-

, ing. I hope people ﬁnd ways to gather and

change society through creativity and art,”
said Greenwald. “Perhaps we can learn

, something from history and the present, to
move forward into the future.” ’

Signs of Change is a traveling exhibit
that.premiered in New York City in Sep-

tember of 2008 before moving to Carnegie
Mellon. But although it’s not an indigenous
Pittsburgh collection, other art entities
around Pittsburgh are getting involved and
contributing to,the exhibition.

, Pittsburgh Film Makers will screen two
relevant ‘ﬁlms about social movement on
Feb. 12 as part of the exhibit.

Both ﬁlms are short, historical news-
reel documentaries. The ﬁrst ﬁlm, “Finally
Got the News,” documents the League of
Revolutionary Black Workers’ actions in
Detroit, Mich., and the second, “Mayday,”
focuses on air disaster investigations.

Pittsburgh’s 'Artist Image Resource and

the Andy Warhol Museum are also contrib-

uting to Signs of Change by holding an ac-
tivist print open studio where visitors can
learn to screen print their own protest and
activist posters. _

V its smarts "had to be manually encoded.

STAIR and robots like it begin with a very
sirnplealgorithrn that, initially, is extremely
dumb. The algorithm is "capable of taking in
data from its surroundings, taking notice of
outcomes and correcting its behavior in the
future. Not only does it correct its behavior,
but it also remembers that it got into trouble
and takes steps in future decisions to avoid
making the same mistakes. .

Machine learning is a signiﬁcant advance
in the paradigm of artiﬁcial intelligence pro-

gramming, as Deep Blue’s method of pro-

gramming quickly becomes too complex to
become feasible. I

Imagine pre-programming a‘ robot to
make all of the decisions you make and re-
act to all the stimuli you encounter during
your brief walk to class every day.

So if it seems we’re on to something,

how much longer will I have to wait until
robots can approximate human behavior?
I There is still a long way to go to get to

Robby from “I, Robot.” Machine learning '
o algorithms depend on constant and accurate
data. '

Whereas shopping Web sites take in their
data from your decisions and purchases, ro-
bots must rely on their sensory technology.
Active research is always required tocreate
new sensors that give robotic brains new in-
sights into the world around them. Existing
sensors 'can also be more accurate and more
discerning. More intelligent robots must, af-
ter all, be able to distinguish objects.

Navigation around a room requires the

"ability to accurately estimate the location of

an object and a_ robot’s speed. Manipulat-
ing objects requires the _ability to accurately
estimate depth of the environment in front
of a camera sensor, as well as the ability to
estimate object size and weight.

STAIR displays the trend of robotics
research to create .more accurate and more
sensitive sensors. In order to successfully
manipulate its environment, STAIR takes
advantage of a camera sensor. The sensor

gives STAIR the ability not only to navigate

around a room but also to .locate and ‘evalu-

ate the dimensions of an object sitting on a '

lab table.
STAIR also comes complete with sensi-
tive audio equipment with enough reception

accuracy to reliablyirespond to voice com— '

mands.

STAIR and research efforts like it 
continue to develop machine-learning algo-
rithms. _

. Robots will continue to increase their
grip on reality, and their ‘abilities to manip-
ulate the world around them will continue

:  ‘The Pitt News 0 www,pittnews.com

to increase. It may be a long way off until i if
a robot, becomes your friend and is ableto
approximate the behavior and intellect of
a human, but machine-learning algorithms
have already been applied to produce robots

capable of acting like pets.

Now Stanford just needs to develop a
workable furry robotics frame into which to

cram its electronics.

Pittsburgh and Philadelphia
sports fans aren’t getting their
dream interstate _ Super Bowl
matchup this week. But even if
it’s not as high proﬁle as the Super

 Bowl, fans will still get to see teams

from their cities square off against

 one another when the Pitt men’s

basketball team travels to Philadel-

" phia to take on the Villanova \Wild-

cats tonight at 7. _

The game will be a homecom-
ing for Pitt players Brad Wanamak-
er and Nasir Robinson, who were
both standout high school basket-
ball players in the Philadelphia area.

 family members and friends are

monumental piece of Philadelphia
history since it opened in 1967.
The game tonight will be the last
college contest ever played there.
Robinson said he’s seen a num-
ber of Philadelphia 76ers games
during his time growing up around
the city and has always imagined
playing in front of the crowd there.
He’ll get that chance tonight.

“Coming from Chester, we al-
ways played in a big atmosphere,”
he said. “At Chester High, we’d
have a big crowd every night.
Some people get scared of lights

around it.”

The strong minutes from Rob-
inson off the bench has helped the
No. ‘3-ranked Panthers 18-1 (6-1
Big East) look impressive in their
last two games after suffering their
ﬁrst loss of the season at Louis-_
ville. Qff the bench, Robinson

 Notre Dame's
slump Continues

_ by Randy Lieberman
Se/zior Staff Write/*

After watching the way the
Notre Dame men’s basketball team
played this past week, it’s hard to
believe they had a 45—game win-
ning streak at home. As it stands
now, the Irish are sitting on a two-
game home losing streak.

Winning streak aside, the Irish
didn’t have much of a chance to
stay at the top of the Big East or
even in the top 25. For a team that
only plays average defense and re-
lies on one big playmaker on of-
fense, this team survived as long as
it could before other teams ﬁgured
it out. Once that happened, Notre
Dame looked like a kid caught

Harangody’s Batman. It’s not as
if taking away the sharpshootjng
McAlarney would disarm Haran-
gody, but teams pulled their best
“Dr. Freeze” imitation and locked
down McAlarney on defense to
render him harmless.

Besides scoring 19 points
against Louisville and 24 against
Syracuse, McAlarney has struggled,
going 4—of—14 from beyond the arc
in the last two games against Con-
necticut and Marquette.

The Irish are now on a four-
game losing streak and, to make
matters worse, they travel to play
Pitt on Saturday. This team has
been relying on Harangody and
McAlarney to carry it thus far,

“He’s a guy who brings energy,” «said Pitt

 coach Jamie Dixon of Robinson. “I think
he’s a guy who maybe should’ve played some 3

more in some games. I think we’ve got to
"continue to get him in there. He has a good
understanding for the game.”

But minutes off the bench can’t do it all.
Much of the Panthers’ success in the two-
game win streak can be attributed to senior
forward Sam Young’s ability to regain his
jump shot. ,

In Pitt’s three games before its current
winning streak, Young shot a combined
15 for 49 from the ﬁeld including 6—of-20
against Louisville.

But in the last two games, Young has gone
12—of—14 and 9—of—14 from the ﬂoor. This is
partly attributed to the fact that he was once
again able to drive to the basket and create
high percentage shots for himself.

He scored 22 points in both games,
enough to earn him Big East Player of the
Week honors.

Another key to the team’s ability to
bounce back from the tough loss has been
sophomore center Dejuan Blair’s ability to
stay out of foul trouble.

This problem plagued the Panthers in
their lone loss, as Louisville attacked Blair,
conﬁning him to the bench for much of the
game and limiting his play to only 20 min-
utes.

The center has seemingly re—adjusted his
game to counteract opponents’ strategies to
come right at him, which caused him to pick
up cheap fouls. In the last two wins, Blair re-
corded 33 and 29 minutes respectively

No. 21 Villanova 15-4 (3-3 Big East)
comes into this game off a win at South
Florida following a tough loss at Connecti—
cut.

Yet, while the \Wildcats record is respect-
able, they have no marquee’ wins, going 0-4
against ranked opponents.

But Pitt knows that trend can change. Vil-
lanova coach Jay W/right, who has led a resur-
gence of the program since he took the job
in 2001, has built teams around dominant
guard-oriented play with typically one strong
big man inside. ' g

_ This formula holds true this season again,
with three guards —— junior Scotty Reynolds
and sophomores Corey Stokes and Corey
Fisher -—— running the offense efficiently
from the perimeter. ’

Robinson knows it.

“I’ve played at camps with Corey Fisher
and Corey Stokes,” said Robinson. “We’ve
got to watch their guardiplay.”

Reynolds is averaging 14.7 points per

The dominant big man in the" middle
comes in the form of 6—foot—8 senior for

16.6 points per game with 7.2 rebounds.

After facing the \Wildcats, Pitt will host

locks, while joining them as pretty safe bets
are Syracuse, Villanova and Georgetown.
Throw in Notre Dame, who many believe
will turn it around, and that gives the Big

West Virginia has a home game against St.

er.lA win tonight against Syracuse wouldn’t
hurt, neither would one at Connecticut on
Saturday. But let’s be serious. The Friars
then host Villanova and travel to West Vir-
ginia for the unofficial Ninth—Team Show-
down in Morgantown, WVa. Even if Provi-
dence beats West Virginia, they still need
some help. Their path to the Big Dance is
possible, but it says here that it is highly un-
likely.

Here are the awards for last week’s ac-
tion:

Big East Hammer on the Hardwood:

Marquette is winning, and jerel McNeal
is a big reason why. The senior stepped-up
to deliver 21- and 27—point games last week
against DePaul and Notre Dame, respec-
tively, while also shooting a combined 50
percent from beyond the arc. Marquette’s
already—potent offense is thriving off the
do—everything guard’s penetration skills.
Don’t sleep on his defense either, it’s just as
much a part of Marquette’s surge as their
point production.

Big East Cupcake:

It’s hard to pick out one person when the
entire team is stinking up the joint, plus, you
read it here last week that he was supposed
to be, “one of the conference’s best scorers
on the front line.” But Dajuan Summers’
point output has dropped, and the Hoyas
have also dropped their last two games. The
junior went a combined 5—of—22 from the
ﬁeld in those two losses against West Vir-
ginia and Seton Hall. ‘

Big East Matchups of the Week:

Tonight isn’t bad to start with. 12 teams
are in action, including Pitt travelling to Vil-
lanova in a No. 4 vs. No. 21 showdown.
Then on Saturday, two big matchups high-
light the schedule. The struggling Irish travel
to Pitt, while Marquette hosts Georgetown.
Then, a huge matchup on Monday tips-off
at Freedom Hall when Louisville hosts Con-
necticut. Don’t miss this game, it should be
an up-tempo track meet.

Upset Alert:

There’s something about the way this
West Virginia team dismantled Georgetown
that makes it easy to identify as an upset
pick. It won’t happen against Louisville on
Saturday, but Syracuse should be wary of
an upset next Wednesday when it hosts the
Mountaineers. ‘ '
