By Jill Carell
Staff Writer

Over 12,000 runners lined up
behind the starting line at Frick
Park yesterday morning for Pitts-
burgh’s 10th annnual Great Race.

The 10-kilometer run began when
Mayor Richard Caliguiri fired the
starting gun at 8:45\a.m. for the
wheelchair racers.

At 9:00 a.m., he shot the gun off
again for thousands of runners
packed like sardines behind the start-
ing line. .

Paul Rugot, a native of Kenya and
a student at Southern Methodist
University in Texas, won the men's
division with a time of 28:15.

Lynn Jennings, who traveled here
from New Hampshire to run in the
race, won the women's division in
32:56.

Caliguiri said that 10 years ago
when the first Great Race was held,
there were 1,100 runners, and he
never thought’ the race would
become much more popular.

Having participated in the race this
year and in previous years, I could
feel the tension due to the increase
in the number of participants. When
the race began, it was impossible to
start off running, unless of course you
happened to be at the very front of
the crowd. If you weren't, you started
off at a slow walk, which has been
typical of the races in the past.

After several minutes, the crowd

spread, and the racers,could begin to .

run.

Unlike previous years, though, the
crowd never fully broke apart. One
constantly had to be aware of runners
cutting in front.—A fear of falling was
prevalent. ' .

   
  

One runner reminded me to ”just
keep your elbows out so you won't
be cut off and fall.’’

’.’During the first mile there was ‘a.

lot of pushing, shoving and weaving,
but it was worth it,” said Jeff Forry,
a Pitt senior. ’’All in all it was a

‘challenge and an honor to be a part

of it,” he said.
Although some ran to place or to

I break records, for most it was just a

run for fun.

Senate approves historic tax reform bill

WASHINGTON — Saturday the
Senate approved the most sweeping
tax reform bill in over 50 years, a bill
that will cut taxes for most workers
while sparing some prized deduc-
tions and boosting the corporate
burden.

The vote was 74-23, with Penn-
sylvania Senators John Heinz and
Arlen Specter voting for the measure.

Earlier, the House passed the
measure by a wide margin, and Presi-
dent Reagan has already said he will
sign the bill as soon as it reaches his

desk, which should be sometime in

early October.

Reagan, who was at Camp David
when word of the passing of the bill
reached him, said, ”Today's historic
vote on tax reform marks the last
legislative hurdle for the American
people who finally have a tax code
they can be proud of; one that is
fairer, simpler for most people — one
that encourages growth and is pro-

family."

Opponents of the bill have
charged, however, that it will stifle
the American economy because the
middle class is the ’f|oser.”

The bill, which will take effect in I

1988, will cut individual tax rates an

' average of 6.1 percent and eliminate

more than 6 million poor people
from the nation's tax rolls.

But more than 20 million couples

-and individuals will pay more, and

deductions for sales taxes and con-
sumer interest will be lost, as will the
the special write-off for two income
couples. '

The bill will severely restrict deduc-
tions for the popular Individual
Retirement Accounts, limiting them
to people who make below $25,000
and who are not covered by a com-
pany pension plan.

The personal exemption will jump
from the current $1,080 to $2,000 in
1989.

Shuttleto fly
five times in '88

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. —
Sources said the nation's space agen-
cy has scheduled five space shuttle
flights for 1988, including two
classified military missions and the
launch of the $1 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.

Shuttle flights have been suspend-
ed since the Jan. 28 Challenger
disaster. NASA has been trying to put

together a flight schedule for the last ‘

few months, sources said. _
NASA official and former Pitt pro-
fessor James Fletcher said the agen-

cy wants to launch the next shuttle
inthe first quarter of 1988, but would
not provide any other details.

But sources said an internal plan-
ning memo listed the following dates
for shuttle flights: Feb. 18, May 26,
July 28, Sept. 22 and Nov. 17.

Those sources said the first flight
will carry a relay and tracking satellite
similar to the one carried on the
Challenger flight, and the September
flight will also carry a tracking and
data relay satellite.

The May and July launchings will
be the classified military missions,
and the November launching will be
the Hubble Space Telescope mission.
The Hubble is the world's most ad-
vanced orbital observatory.

Beirut forces
do battle

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Police said

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 29, 1986

Amin Gemayel Saturday, sparking a
fierce battle for control of mostly
Christian East Beirut, killing at least
39 people.

Sources said most of the heavier
fighting occurred near the three-mile
”green line” that divides the strife-
torn city into two sectors: one con-
trolled by Christians and the other by
Moslems.

Sources said battles raged all day
long, with Moslem militias making

great headway early in the day, but

Christian militias recovering much of
the lost territories later on.

’.¢‘-‘.2

fight against alcohol abuse

By Douglas Bennett
Staff Writer

The brothers of Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity, in response to growing
concerns about alcohol, have found-
ed a local chapter of BADD, a
campus-wide program with com-
munity ties.

BADD, which stands for Brothers

Against Drunk Driving, is still in its -

infancy at Pitt, yet the brothers in-
volved have proved themselves to be
dedicated and enthusiastic.
According to Dan Keelan, a FIJI
brother and current chairman of
BADD at Pitt, the original group was
founded by Kevin Thompson.
”One day at a meeting, a few
brothers were discussing our legal
liabilities [concerning alcohol]. Every
day you hear about some bar getting
“sued,” Keelan said. ”We thought
-we'd start alcohol awareness for our
brothers.”

On campus, FIJI is participating in
the upcoming Alcohol Awareness
Program sponsored by the Tower A
RSA. Keelan said BADD members
have been invited to speak at several
events throughout the program.

Scheduled for Oct. 8 and 9, the
program will feature breathalyzer
demonstrations, alcohol-free socials
and other programs intended to
educate the student population.
Keelan said that FIJI brothers, along
with members of the professional
community, will be on hand to
distribute literature and answer ques-
tions throughout the event.

J The FIJI brothers are also actively
involved with BEAR. Primarily con-
cerned with drug-related problems,
BEAR, which stands for‘Be Educated,
Aware and Responsible, sponsors
educational programs for elementary
school students. '

and Allegheny General is looking in-
to it,” Keelan said.

Throughout the 12-week program,
speakers, eventually including frater-
nity brothers, will be sent to an in-
dividual school once every two
weeks. All BADD members who
wish to participate will be put
through a comprehensive training
program. Keelan realizes the advan-
tages of just such a program.

”We can't just go into a school and

say, ‘Don't do drugs, don't" use"

alcohol’ — it's not that simple,”
Keelan said.

On a national level, the effort is less
organized, although there have been
several encouraging developments.
7-II Food Stores have donated
$2,400 to BEAR, and outdoor adver-
tisers have donated billboard space
to the cause. FIJI has also presented
the program to their national offices
and has elicited responses from
several other chapters.

is getting better

After weeks of public outcry, the city finally did something about
the now-famous ”Weekend War Zone" on the corner of Bouquet
Street and Forbes Avenue. The police were out in full force on Fri-
day and Saturday nights. It was a welcome change to see so many
officers concentrated in such a small area.

KDKA even had a news crew to cover the activities of the zone
on Friday. Students were overjoyed to see that something was final-
_ly being done to help make their neighborhood safer. The media's
extensive coverage of the situation last week seemed to make a dif-
ference. Not so much in that police presence had been increased,
but the roving gangs that had heretofore plagued south Oakland were
absent. Evidently they knew that their criminal mischief wouldn't be
tolerated in south Oakland anymore.

Well, Pitt survived another weekend. Things seem to be toning
down on the corner of Bouquet Street and Forbes Avenue. However,
one apparently incident-free weekend should not be taken as an ex-
cuse for the police to stop their concentration in the area. It's been
poor in the past, and it may worsen if the police lessen their presence
in south Oakland. The streets were safer this weekend; Let's keep
them that way.

Apathetic crowds
ruin our prestige

Wasn't it great to watch Pitt waltz all over the Mountaineers on

Saturday afternoon? It looks as if the football team is destined for
greatness, if not this year then in the coming years. Perhaps this yearjs
team can regain some of the national attention that seems to have
waned since the last time we had a great football team. One of the
best perks in having a good football program is that when the team
rises to the top, its university and its fans generally rise along with
it. Some people may not appreciate it, but in this day and age, a
university's prominence is sometimes judged by its football team and
its fans support of the team. We've got the good football team part
down, but if one were to judge the University of Pittsburgh solely
by the spirit exhibited by the fans at game time, how well would we
rate?
' The fact that Pitt fans can't complete a decent wave and don't have
any stadium-wide cheers (i.e. let's go  Mountaineers!) is telling the
world that we're a group of apathetic people with very little pride
in where we go to school.

This year is still new. We can get behind our athletic teams, and
in doing so, we will be getting behind our school.

It takes pride to become a truly great university. If one were to ask
someone who attends Harvard, Yale or any other university con-

V, sidered to be great, where he goes to school, you'll find that he is

immensely proud of his school. If one were to ask a Pitt student that
same question, the Pitt student looks to see if anybody’s watching
and then whispers, ’’I go to Pitt," as quietly as possible.

That may be a little extreme, but it's close. There's no excuse for
that attitude. This is an incredible university. Our programs are ex-
cellent. We have a long, colorful history. There is so much here to
be proud of. Penn State people are some of the most fiercely devoted
fans in_ the country. Because of that ardent devotion, the rest of the
country thinks Penn State is a better school than Pitt, which we know
is very false. But that should be taken as a lesson. If fan devotion can
so influence a university's reputation, don't we owe it to Pitt to show
a little more spirit?

So get some pride in this place. Do it not only for Coach Gottfried
and his boys, not only for the glory of the blue and gold, do it for
yourselves. Show the rest of the country that we are a great universi-
ty. .

Crime victims talk back

To all Pitt students, black, white,
purple and green: There are some
points of conflict that need to be
cleared up about The Pitt News
coverage of the incidents of Saturday,
Sept. 20, 1986.

I personally totally disagree with all
of the incidents that occurred on
Saturday night, not because it was
black against white or white against
black, but because it was people
against people.

I too, just as Donald Frazier, have
spent my whole life trying to do right
by all people regardless of race, col-
or or creed. Just because I and my
roommate, Debbie Rummel, took a
stand against these criminal acts, are
we to be condemned? I happen to
agree with Donald Frazier; there
aren't enough activities and recrea-
tional facilities for the youths of Pitts-
burgh — black, white, purple or
green.

Now that we have the attention of
all of the students and the city of-
ficials, are we just going to let the
issue die? Why don't we do
something positive about it?

To the person who accused us of
being racist — just because we took
a stand and reported the facts — you
could at least have [had] the courage
to sign your name; we did, and now
we get abused for it. Is this right? To
Donald Frazier: After reading your ar-
ticle — I don't even know you — I
have respect for you. You took a
stand with your beliefs and you
backed it with your name. This is
something people should be proud
to do, not afraid to do. I, for one, am
not afraid.

Debra Kolesar
\ Nursing '87
00000

I am writing in response to Friday's
editorial concerning racism. I am

defending myself, Debbie Rummel,»

and the 12 other victims of assault
who are being accused of racism. The
first point I would like to make is that
I am by no means a racist. I would
have reported the incidents that oc-
curred on Saturday night, [Sept. 20],
if they were done by either whites or
blacks. Race is completely irrelevent
to the problem of crime on the
Oakland streets. In fact, I specifical-

_ ly told the reporter from The Pitt

News that I did not want the article
to appear racist. I also told both news
stations that I contacted that race of
the people involved in the crime was
irrelevent.

LETTERS

I am truly sorry if my comments of-
fended anyone; they certainly were
not stated for that purpose. In fact,
neitherl nor my roommate, Debra
Kolesar, remember making such
comments. I also was angered by the
article. And on behalf of the 12 vic-
tims, they were simply reporting the
facts. All I wanted to do was to make
the streets safer for the people of
Oakland. To the person who wrote
the editorial regarding racism, I am
aware the original article
misconstrued my true objective, and
I would like to assure you that I am
anything but a racist.

The next time I'm confronted with
a gang of black youths getting ready
to pound my head in with a 2x4, I'll
remember that they are just poor,
socially deprived, unhappy black
kids from the Hill. And I guess that
I will have to let them beat me and
rob me instead of summoning the
police -because now — thanks to Bill
Markley, Donald Frazier, et al. (The
Pitt News, Sept. 26, 1986) — I know
that the reason they are being so ”un-
productive” is because I, as a white
person, have been negligent in pro-
viding for their very specific and very
special needs.

God forbidthey should have to do
anything for themselves. Their en-
vironment is obviously my respon-
sibility. So I guess they have every
right to beat up on us honkies at.Pitt
who clearly are directly responsible
for their lack of playgrounds and
structuralized entertainment. The ut-
ter gall they and their friends would
feel being tossed into the pad-
dywagon for my sins is just too much
to bear.

So after a few weeks in the hospital,
I guess what I'll do is hang myself,
because my white skin obviously
compels me to deprive black people
of everything that they need to be
rich and happy. I concede that I had
to have that ”pounded into my
head.”

After all, how can I, as a white per-

son, ever forgive myself for the ongo-
ing misery of being a black person?

Capitalism vs. Socialism

I was glad to seethat you had an
article about the debate on
”Capitalism vs. Socialism,” but I was

' dismayed to see that you misquoted

my question. The nature of your mis-
quote is important because it greatly
changes the meaning of-the question
and the point I was trying to make.

I did not say, ”How can you say these .

governments are repressive  ?”
What I really said was, ”The right in
making their argument against soc-
ialism always points out totalitarian
and oppressive socialist regimes but
then conveniently leaves out mention
of totalitarian and oppressive
capitalist regimes.” What about those
capitalist societies which are
totalitarian and repressive such as
Chile, South Africa, the Phillipines
under Marcos, Haiti under Duvalier,
Iran under the Shah and a number of
other Latin American countries?

This is a vastly different question
from what you "quoted” in your
paper. Your misquote conveys a
naive or equally biased person on the
left, still letting the right get off ”scot-
free" in its one-sided argument. It is
interesting to note that Dr. Rubin’s
answer to my question was to
redefine capitalismjby, in effect, say-
ing that any government that is op-
pressive, regardless of its economic
structure and principles, cannot be
capitalistic. Indeed, this was a major
point of my question, to make the
argumentthat if you define [com-
pletely] all of the negative aspects of
capitalism, of course it will be
”perfect” and if you then define
[completely] the positive aspects of
socialism on top of that (e.g. the suc-
cesses of socialist democracies such
as Norway, Sweden and Denmark) of
course socialism becomes all bad.
But in the process of making this type
of argument, one invalidates the argu-
ment because one is then just play-
ing a semantic game.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 29, I986

‘Friends shouldn't buy each other's homes

-a

It was one of those little pieces of I,

fate —— one of those things that touch
you and tell you how fast time is slip-
ping by.

I was talking with an old friend of
mine, a guy who still lives in my
hometown, and he said, "You know,
your old house has just been sold.”

That wasn't so surprising to me. My

- parents long ago moved out of the

house where we lived when I was
growing up and going to high school;
as far as I know, the house has had
several different owners since that
time.

"So it's been sold again," I said, not
really that interested.

"Yeah," my friend said. "And do
you know who bought it?"'

And he dropped it on me.

The people who had bought my
house are a man and woman I went
to high school with. The_man had
been a classmate of mine; the woman
had been his girlfriend. Both of them
had been over to my house many
times when I was a kid. And now
they have bought the house.

I couldn't believe it. The house you
grew up in will always be, in your

mind, your parents’ house. No mat- .
. ter who else lives in it, that house will

The following column is lampoon,
wholly lampoon and nothing but
lampoon.

It's a beautiful day in the

neighborhood,

A beautiful day in this neighborhood,
Would you be mine?

Would you pay damage fines?
Won't you be  my tenant?

Hi boys and girls! My name is -Mr.
Oakland, ' and I'm your friendly
neighborhood landlord. Can you say
that word? Landlord. What is a
landlord? I'll tell you as soon as I take
off my Gucci shoes 

 Ah, these Reeboks feel much
better. Now, what is a landlord?
Well, a landlord is sort of like a
museum curator. He, or she, buys
old, decaying, run down and vermin-
infested buildings in Oakland and
goes to great lengths to preserve them
in that condition.

Well, sometimes landlords will
make changes, reluctantly, like a

be your dad's and your mom's. It's

one thing dealing with the idea that

eventually other families move in.
But one of your buddies moving

in? Owning your house?

I mulled this over for a while, and
then I took a deep breath and called
the fellow who had just bought our
old house.

He wasn't home, but his wife was.

"|s it true?” I said.

"Yes," she said. She said that she
and her husband and family had not
moved in just yet, but that they had
indeed purchased the house and
were making preparations to take it
oven

"The house has changed a lot since
you were a boy," she said. "The
family that's in it now has expanded
the bathroom next to the master
bedroom, and because of that they
have cut the size of that other
bedroom in front.”

That other bedroom in front? That
other bedroom in front happened to
be Debby’s room — my sister's room.
How could anybody reduce its size
just to make a bathroom larger?

"You're welcome to come and visit
any time you're in town," she said.

4 "Just give us a call."

Welcome to Mr.

curator carefully brushing off ancient
dirt to reveal a moldy monkey skull.
The skull is then nicely polished to
make the outside seem shiny and
pretty.

What about inside the monkey
skull? Ah, don't worry about such
things, boys and girls. Think about
how wonderful it is to live in
Oakland!

Anyhow, like any good museum
curator knows, I need money to keep
the museum  I mean apartment 
open. So we both charge admission.
The curator charges a daily entrance
rate, and I collect! a mandatory
monthly rent for one year — and a
security deposit — so I can buy im-

portant stuff that will enhance the '

quality of my properties, like, well 
like my shiny new red '86 Corvette
outside! Can you spell that word?
Corvette.

Whoops! There's a knock at my

door! I wonder who that can be?
Shall we go see who it is?

“Where do we find

Editor's Note: The following col-
umn is part of The Pitt‘ News
"Flashback" series. It was published
on Wednesday, Nov. 27, I963. The
writer was Josey Crossman. The col-
umn refers to the assassination of
President /ohn F. Kennedy and tells
a bitterly ironic story of an event
which stemmed from the national
tragedy.

It's true that upon first glance this
article may not seem topical, but pay
attention to what Crossman says
about the maturation of a generation.
How mature has our generation
become with all that we've lived
through? Crossman noted that her
generation was always regarded as
spoiled because it never had to deal
with a war or a depression. Neither
has ours. Read this article and think
about where our generation is going.
Are we going to make a difference,
or are we simply going to pursue our
materialistic self-interests?

The current trend of our genera-
tion’s apathy may or may not be a
reality. In part, that is the reason the
"Flashback" series was established.
Only students can prove or disprove
these claims of apathy. This column
tells us how profoundly moved peo-
ple were in November 1963 after the
death of President Kennedy. People
who lived through that national
tragedy will carry the scars for the
rest of their lives. How long will we
remember our latest national tragedy

— the loss of the space shuttle
Challenger?

The loss of the shuttle was a
tragedy in every sense of the word.
The entire country was numb for
days. There were comparisons made
to theassassination of ].F. K., but were
we as affected in /anuary 7986 as
people were in November 1963?

Sure, the nation mourned for a
time, but people went on with their
lives shortly thereafter. Will that
event mature our generation?
Tragedy is not something to look for-
ward to, but it is reality in its coldest
terms. Tragedy is a necessary evil one
must face along the road to maturi-
ty. Obviously one does not look back
and savor that particular memory,
but it does help one to see that life
is not all champagne and caviar, and
when one understands that in order
to see good in the world, one must
also see the bad.

The Pitt News welcomes responsi-
ble comment on columns reprinted
in the "Flashback” series. All
responses must be typewritten, and
the name and phone number of the
author must be included in order for
it to be published.

Somebody mentioned Friday night
that that afternoon's tragedy was the
first of such universal importance to
affect our generation. Our parents

Harbor and World War II and had _

I walked around for the next day,

grieved at the death of Roosevelt, and
when they said, we've seen more
than you, so take our word for it, we
sometimes mused what it would be
like to live through a national
disaster. ’

For many, especially after Monday
classes were cancelled, it meant get-
ting home as fast as they could.
Automatically, family unity seemed
quite important. For most, it shook
them from their seemingly endless
security as the unvanquished youth
— kids who had gone through per-
sonal troubles and regarded national
figures as something objective and
apart, something that really didn't
concern them as individuals.

Indeed, we were immature
because we had never been chal-
lenged. Our parent's generation fre-
quently regarded us as spoiled
because we had never undergone
such experience — we had never
tramped on tin cans in high school
to return them as scrap; we had never
realized that our grandparents hoard-
ed ration stamps to feed us lamb-
chops on bi-weekly visits; we had
never seen our whole high school
class march off to war and hear that
the guy we had sat next to in English .

"Dennis, I heard the news," I said.

"Isn't it great?” hesaid.

We made pleasantries for about 60
seconds, and then I knew I had to say
it.

"Dennis," I said, ''I don't know
how you feel about this, but it's about
the wierdest damn thing I ever heard
of."

"I know,” he said. "I know. It's just
so strange.”

"Well, I'm glad we agree on that,"
I said. ''I was afraid that you'd think
it was normal."

“Normal?” he said. "We have
three kids now, just like your mom
and dad did. My daughter is 15 years
old — a sophomore in high school.
One of my sons is going to be mov-
ing into your old bedroom."

He said that he was in the flooring,
carpeting and tile business now, but
that he recalled the days and nights
when he had visited my house as a
kid as if they were yesterday.

"Remember that summer you had
mono?" he said.

"Of course," I said.

"Every time I walk into the house
now, all I can think of is all those days
all of us would come over to visit

you," he said. "I don't know why
that's the image I have — but it sure
is."

I ”Your wife tells me that the

bathroom in front has been expand- I

ed," I said.

"You should see it," he said.
"Jacuzzi, steam bath  the whole
works." i

I paused for a second and then
said: ”Dennis, you do realize
something, don't you?"

"What’s that?" he said.

"You're going to be sleeping in my
parents’ bedroom,” I said.

"Don't say that," he said.

He, too, invited me to stop by and
visit any time I was in town, and I
said that I would. .

But I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

I wish Dennis and his family
nothing but happiness in that old
house; I hope they find as much joy
within those walls as my mom and
dad and sister and brother and I did.

But can I go back and visit? With
my old high school friend sleeping
in my parents’ bedroom and his son
sleeping in mine?

I just don't know. I have a feeling
that I'll be thinking about this one for
a long, long time.

"Damn it, Mr. Oakland, we'll take
you to court over this! Your inaction

What! Legal action? You have a
funny sense of humor, kid. Don't you
know that judges love us landlords?
They couldn't care less about petty
gripes from some lowly student who
probably doesn't contribute to their
election campaigns anyway.

”But the water overflowing in the
toilet bowl is flooding the basement

class was now dead.
Last year's Cuban crisis brought a

scare, but a month later the impact »

on our personal lives was non-
existent. Friday brought a reality.

One friend of mine told me a story
that is so fraught with‘ irony it seems
unreal, yet in a sense it symbolizes
this shake-up and the tragic maturing
of our generation as a whole.

Four years ago in a history class, he
relates, he remembered watching his
little old teacher describe the death
of Lincoln, tears falling over her
cheeks as she acted out Booth's
stance in the box in Ford Theatre, the
shot and the collapse of the president.

She kept emphasizing responsibili-
ty, he said, the responsibility of
Booth, of Lincoln and of her students
as citizens of the United States.

This oversentimentality nauseated
him. "In boyish delight, I sat and fan-
cied in my imagination a chance to
get even with her for all of those tests,
those discussions, those papers.

"Then the thought occurred to me
—— if only I could have been the first
to tell her of Lincoln's death. I could
have seen her squirm in agony, those
large tears form, her whole body
twist. Her and that stupid respon-
sibility jazz."

So four years later, after hearing the
first ‘news over an old B-line teletype
machine, he bumped into that former
teacher crossing Fifth Avenue.

_ There were smiles, handshakes and

"What's your last name again?"
before he commented how tragic it
was — about the president.

"She clasped my hand," he said.
"Her eyes opened, and she said,

'What about the president?’ 'Haven't , I

you heard? He's been shot.’ 'Who's
been shot?’ She didn't believe me.
'Why, President Kennedy,’ I
answered. 'Haven't you heard?’ "

He sat in our office a few days ago
mulling this irony. Suddenly the
romantic idea of tragedy had disap-
peared: No longer did it seem
dramatic and exciting that our fathers
fought in a war; no longer did the
grief attached to a national disaster
affect only other people.

Tragedy doesn't work that way. It's
harsh. When it's of a personal nature,
the individual grows. When it's of a
national nature, a generation begins
to mature.

Perhaps President John Kennedy's
death stung even more frantically
because, in a sense, he represented
the vigor and optimism of his people,
particularly this generation of youth.
His death meant a disheartening of

our own innocence; self-identifica- .

tion -plunged the level of homage in-
to a sincere individual loss.

It's not the kind of experience you
welcome with open arms; there is no
romantic aura of an incipient maturity
for a generation. I think, in fact, it
wishes it were still spoiled — spoiled

tions based in Central American
countries use tools such as deception,
lying, propaganda, economic sanc-
tions, intelligence gathering and
large-scale military intervention.
Criticizing President Reagan's
claim that he has seen four wars, and
therefore should possess an
understanding of the situations in
these countries, Stockwell called
Reagan ”an old man who has
glorious movie fantasies of war.”
”I submit to you this man has a
defective mind,” Stockwell said.

Defending this accusation,
Stockwell stated that Reagan does not
have a full conception of the in-
frastructure of bombs and missiles.

”This is the man that called the MX
the ’peacemaker,’ ” he said.

According to Stockwell, the United
States goes to war every 10 years, and
Americans are taught to hate other
people because of aggression and
economics.

The only solution, he said, is to find
some other way of making money
than by making arms.

Patrons relax at the bar at Thirsty’s. The establishment is unique in that it employs only

female bartenders.

Bartenders at Thirsty’s different

from other Oakland nightspots

By Renee Johnson
For, The Pitt News

Sit down at almost any bar in
Oakland, and most likely you'll be
served by a guy. Thirsty’s Restaurant
and Saloon, at 301 North Craig St.,
is the exception to that rule. It's the
only bar in Oakland that has all
female bartenders. In fact, the only
men other than the customers are the
bouncer and the cook.

Explains Cathy Tfnden, daytime
manager, ”It wasn't always this way;
it just happened naturally, as the ma-

I jority of our clientele are men." The

male workers in the past just weren't
as comfortable as the women.

Debbie Painter, nighttime manager
and a student at Pitt, said she felt that
her sex caused very few difficulties
behind the bar. . .

”Most of the people who come in
here are regulars. They respect us for
who we are and protect us from any
newcomers who might try to start
trouble. You have to set the tone for
how the relationship will be.”

Val lansson, also a bartender and
student at Pitt, agreed. ”As a female
bartender, you have to know how to .
be firm in handling difficult situa-
tions. Some people think that girls are
more easily manipulated. Sometimes
they try to take advantage; but I don't
see much of a problem."

Painter said that shutting someone
off is the hardest part of her job.
”Men don't like a woman to tell them
when they've had too much. They
take it better from a man because he's
usually bigger. I think size has a lot
to do with it." _

Linden added that it's not only the
men who get upset when shut off by
a female. Often women don't see
another woman behind the bar as
much of.a threat. They can get of-
fended and sometimes more verbal-
ly abusive than the men.

Thirsty’s bartenders (from left) Peggy Smith, Debbie Painter
and Christine Blotzer.

None of the women felt uncomfort-
able because of their sex.

”I have fun when I work,” said
Painter. I make a lot of good friends
both with the customers and the
other workers.”

Val sees Thirsty’s as ”a big family”
because of the characteristic
friendliness of the place.‘ The at-
mosphere reflects this with plants,
mirrors and knickknacks hanging all
around. It's casual and fun.

Thirsty’s offers specials every day
of the week. The most popular are
Tuesday's tacos and tequila and Fri-
day's peel-n-eat shrimp and beer.
Thursday is import night and
Wednesday is company-of-the-day
night with 25 percent off all food and.
drinks for those who sign up. There
are also frozen, drink specials every
day. I

The menu is new and expanded as

_ of this week. It features more salads

and sandwiches, enlarged munchies
and hot wings. Any day of the week
you can get soup or quiche, or you
can build your own sandwich from
a long list of condiments. The prices
are very reasonable and the portions
generous. Take out service is also
available.

In addition to its food and drinks,
Thirsty’s also provides a wide varie-
ty of live musical entertainment, from
the upbeat rock ’n’ roll of Shari and
Dave to Gary Vincent, the national
recording artist. '

Thirsty’s also has three screens for
football games, a pinball machine,
darts, video games, a jukebox and
video jukebox.

Central America, South Africa most Thi,-Sty/5

 

susceptible to revolution, prof says

. By Jack Burkman
" Staff Writer

South Africa and Central America

. are the two regions in the world most

susceptible to revolution, according
to Jaroslav Krejci, the University of

_,Lancaster professor who addressed

the Center for Russian and East Euro-

_ pean Studies yesterday.

Krejci contended that revolutions
in these areas should be classified as

I exogenous ”for they are provoked by

causes from abroad.”
These types of rebellions, he
argued, contrast sharply with en-

. dogenous revolutions, the causes of
‘which are generated from within.

”Most of the major revolutions in

modern times have been exoge-
nous,” Krejci said. ”The British,
French, Russian and Chinese serve as
good examples.”

According to Krejci, for any insur-
rection to be successful a number of
factors must be present.

The first factor is a scapegoat. There
must be some group upon which
blame for existing conditions can be
placed. '’[Secondly] the intellectual
community must paricipate,” Krejci
said. Finally, and most importantly,
there must be an idyllic model;
revolutionaries need an ideological
image of a better society.

Krejci contended that the most
facinating aspect of these types of

revolutions is not what causes them
but what results from them.

”A revolution is a process of social
change,” he said. ”Revolutionaries
have different goals. Some want to
change much — some, only a little.
After ‘a period of oscillation, one
group gains control and supresses the
others.”

According to Krejci, this pattern
produces a cycle. Generally, the
political system restored is too much
like the ancien regime.

He asserts that revolutions cannot
begin at the top. "Revolutions must
begin from an echelon below the
elite, though not necessarily at the
bottom,” Krejci said.

Panthers
win big
over WVU

By Bob Travers

Sports Editor

No, seriously, wasn't this supposed
to be a rivalry?

This was Pitt vs. West Virginia,
filled with endless mudslinging and
punch-throwing. This game was sup-
posed to have hate.

This year's game lacked much of
what a bitter rivalry is supposed to
have, including suspense. Pitt spot-
ted West Virginia a field goal before
roaring back for a huge victory.

The Panthers made a mockery of
the Battle of Interstate 79, running
over the Mountaineers like a Ken-
worth over a racoon. Pitt scored over
40 points for the second week in a
row, trashing West Virginia 48-16.
This was the first time a Pitt teamuhad
scored over 45 points in a game since
they beat Louisville 55-10 in '83.

And forthe fourth time this season
Pitt played better than it had the week
before.

’’I think we're getting better," Mike

_ Gottfried said after the game. ”All a
- coach can ask for is that his team gets

better. The key for us is that we have
to keep improving.”

lf Pitt improves from Saturday's per-
formance, they could be national
champs in two weeks. The Panthers
were thoroughly dominating in every
phase of the game.

Pitt passed for 313 yards and
rushed for 238 more, running up 549
yards in total offense. West Virginia
had 282 yards in total offense. For
those of you keeping score at home,
Pitt averaged 7.3 yards per play, West
Virginia 4.1.

’’It was incredible,” said kickerjeff

VanHorne. ”l don't think the team
had one weak area.” Certainly the
kicking game, which at the start of the
season was Pitt's biggest disappoint-
ment, has turned into one of Pitt's
strongest areas.

VanHorne was perfect for the sec-
ond game in a row, kicking two field
goals, one of them a 42—yarder, and
connecting on all six of his extra
points.

It is getting to be a familiar story,
but again this week John Congemi
was masterful in guiding the Pitt
offense.

’’It’s like having a coach on the
field,” Gottfried said of Congemi.
The fifth—year senior played what was
perhaps the best all-around game of
his career. Congemi was 16 of 30 in
throwing for 260 yards. Of those 16
completions, three were for
touchdowns.-

The first of those touchdowns, a
66-yarder to Billy Osborn in the first
quarter, was the longest completion
of Congemi’s career and the longest
Pitt touchdown pass since 1980
when Rick Trocano threw 57 yards
to Dwight Collins.

”Our confidence level is up,” Con-
gemi said. ’’I think we can become
a great team. This isn't a team of
known players. There are no Bill
Fralics, no Dan Marinos, no Jim
Coverts or Chris Dolemans, but these
guys will become known.”

One Pitt player known as a defen-
sive back showed yesterday that
perhaps he is better as a wide
receiver. Keith Tinsley caught two
passes for 43 yards in his first game
as a wide receiver since his high

Please see Win, page 1.8

 

 

Billy Osborn scored Pitt's first touchdown Saturday on ‘a 66-yard pass from John Congemi. Osborn
also threw a touchdown pass of his own, a 39-yarder to tight end Vernon Kirk.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 29, 1986

Season could rest on Notre Dame game

The fact that the Pitt Panthers have
looked like the Steelers of the 1970s
the past two weeks only makes it all
the more ironic that Pitt should be 4-0
and ranked in the Top 15 or even the
Top 10. There is no doubt that Pitt
would have beaten Maryland had
Mark Brasco made those field goals,
and they would have beaten North
Carolina State had Pitt not have had
that last punt blocked.

But, as we all know, yesterday is
lost and gone forever, and rather than
looking back, Pitt must concentrate
on the remainder of its schedule.

The crucial games for Pitt from here
on in are Notre Dame, Miami and
Penn State. With seven games re-
maining, that leaves Temple, Navy,
Rutgers and Syracuse as games Pitt
must win — no ifs, ands or buts about
it. Should Pitt lose any one of those
games, virtually all hopes of a bowl
game will go up in smoke.

Pitt, assuming they will beat Tem-
ple next week, will go into the Notre
Dame game 3-1-1. This could be the
most important game Pitt plays all

The Pitt women's tennis team add-
ed to its win record Friday by shut-
ting out Duquense University 9-0.
The team's record now stands four
wins, two losses. The Lady Panthers
totally dominated the match, serving
Duquense some topnotch tennis
while they were at it.

4-1-1 and definitely in the Top 20. A
loss would make Pitt wait until next

Following the game at Notre
Dame, Pitt has a week off, then takes
on Navy in the homecoming game.
Navy trounced Lehigh 41-0 Saturday
to push the Middie record to 2-1, but
beating Lehigh is roughly equivalent
to Navy beating South Park High
School. Navy has given Pitt trouble
in_ the past two years, tying Pitt~in
1984 and beating the Panthers last
year. Pitt better not have the prob-
lems this year. If they don't the Pan-
thers would be 5-1-1.

After Navy, Pitt travels to Syracuse.
The Orangemen have been the big-
gest disappointment since Billy Idol's
new album. Army beat Syracuse.
Rutgers beat Syracuse. South Park

would beat Syracuse. Pitt better beat --

Syracuse. The only way Pitt won't
win is if they don't show up. In the
past Pitt's athletic teams have really
been rather punctual and Pitt should
be 6-1-1.

Feltingoff then came on strong in the

After the Syracuse game, things
could get ugly. Pitt hosts Miami on
Nov. 8. Miami destroyed Oklahoma
Saturday and will be the No. 1 team
in the country when they play Pitt.
This game could be a lot closer than
people think, especially if Pitt keeps
winning between now and then. But
Pitt is probably a year away from
beating a team of Miami's caliber.
6-2-1.

The story remained the same for
the Lady Panthers in doubles play,
winning three out of three matches
played. Leading the team in the:
doubles victory were Bridget Kyle-
and Jodi Levine. They played a com--
petitive match and came away with:
a 7-5, 7-6 victory in the No. 1
doubles slot. Stephanie Nelson andl
Carrie deVera proved to be a lethal!
combination, extinguishing their
competitors’ attempts 6-3, 6-3 in the
No. 2 doubles match. Rounding out
doubles play were Bonnie Kartzman
and Karen Meade, who were also vic--

The Panthers get a break the week
after the Miami game -— maybe.
Rutgers is 3-0-1 and playing much
better than anybody expected them
to play, but their party will come to
a crashing halt next week against
Penn State. After next week, Rutgers
will most likely go back to playing
the way Rutgers usually plays. That
means Pitt should win. With Miami
the previous week and Penn State the
following one, Pitt will have to win.
If they do, Pitt would be 7-2-1.

The Big Game could be even big-
ger than usual this year. The 1986
Pitt-Penn State game could actually
mean something for both teams this
year.‘ Penn State has only one tough
game before Pitt —— Alabama. The rest
of the schedule is among the easiest
the Nittany Lions have ever played.
Penn State was never known for
challenging themselves the way
Notre Dame or Miami does, but the

’ Lions have outdone themselves this

year. Between now and Pitt, Penn
State plays Rutgers, Cincinnati,
Syracuse, Alabama, West Virginia,

torious, winning the No. 3 doubles; 7

match in two straight sets 6-0, 6-3..

The Lady Panthers have reached
the halfway mark in their season.
With only six remaining matches, the

team will now start concentrating
more intensely on the Big East Cham- F

pionships, to be held Oct. 24-26.
Senior captain Jodi Levine com-
mented, ”At this point of the season
we've got to get our heads together
for the Big East Championships. Our
team's biggest strength is that we are
very close knit. We enjoy each
other’s company and support each

Panther

By Mike Bodek

For The Pitt News

At a recent University of Pittsburgh
soccer game, a small group of peo-
ple sat together in anticipation of
what was to come. They watched
carefully, taking a particular interest
in two of the Panthers’ freshmen.

From the Trinity soccer jackets they
wore, it was obvious who they were
watching. And they couldn't have
been prouder, or cheered louder,
when one of the Trinity twosome
scored his first collegiate goal en
route to "a 6-1 Pitt victory over St.
Francis.

Bryan Hammond and Scott Arm-
strong are the ones who have made
their families and friends so proud.
Hammond, a midfielder for the Pan-

Trinity freshman helping

soccer team 

thers, is a starter and was the one
who accounted for the goal. Arm-
strong, who is a midfielder and
defender, is starting to see some play-
ing time, and he is making a good im-
pression on the Pitt coaches.
"Even though Bryan is a freshman,
he's an experienced player,” said Pitt
coach Joe Luxbacher. ”He’s played
in a lot of good, competitive amateur
programs. They both played in a
good high school program. Scott is
a player with a lot of potential. He
is very quick, but he has to learn
some things. I foresee both of them
being good players in our program.”
The Panthers are off to a strong
start, which is something that Ham-
mond and Armstrong are used to,

coming from a winning program such .

as Trinity's.

”Things look good for us, especial-
ly since we're such a young team,”
Armstrong said. ’’I think we'll have
a powerful team in the years to come.
I see a lot of promise.” ,

Hammond and Armstrong both
started on the 1984 co-PIAA cham-
pionship team, which was coached
by former Pitt soccer player Art
Richardson. It was Richardson who
guided. them to become tough
players. .

,”Coach Richardson believed in
hard work and determination in
yourself,” said Hammond. ”|t’s all
what you want, how much you want
to work and what you want to get out
of it.”

Armstrong offered the same
thoughts. ”He was a disciplinarian
when it came to practice and the way
he prepared for games,” said Arm-
strong. ”He laid down the law.
Everything paid off because we had
such a great team.”

Going from Richardson to Lux-
bacher was helpful to both players
because of some similarities between
the two coaches.

”Joe is not a coach who just stands
on the sidelines,” said Hammond.

school days. One of those catches

was a 31-yard touchdown play.

’’It wasn't as easy.as it looked,”
Tinsley said of his offensive debut. ’’I
took a few shots. I dropped a pass
and just had to come back. It's a mat-
ter of character.” The touchdown
was as pretty a pattern as you'll ever
see Louis Lipps run. Tinsley and
Michael Stewart both raced down the
short side of the field into the end
zone. Stewart cut in front of Tinsley
taking a West Virginia back with him.
Tinsley then quietly slipped behind
the coverage and found himself all
alone in the left corner of the end
zone. Then it was just a matter of
catching the ball.

’’I gave him [the WVU defensive
back] a move to the inside,” Tinsley
said. ”Stewart was in there, and I just
dropped in behind the coverage.” All
that after less than a week of practice
at wide receiver.

_ The injury to Reggie Williams was

supposed to decimate the passing‘

game, but in fact the opposite hap-

Kurt Weber

’’He’ll get out and demonstrate
something to you. He won't tell you
things, he'll show you them. Coach
Richardson did the same things.”
Both players were all-WPlAL selec-
tions and played in the Dapper Dan

_Soccer Classic. Hammond, who

scored 35 career goals with 25
assists, is tied for ninth place in all-
time Trinity scoring. He is also one
of two four-year starters in the history
of the Trinity program. '

Armstrong, in addition to his soc-
cer talent, was an honor student in
advanced classes with a 4.0 QPA.

‘The transition from high-school to
college is often a tough time, but hav-
ing a high school teammate around
makes things a lot easier.

”lt’s an extra bonus, especially dur-
ing the first week when we didn't
know anybody,” said Armstrong. ”lt
was nice to have Bryan around.”

And it is nice for the Pitt soccer
team to have the Trinity duo, and
their cheering fans around, too.

pened. Pitt's passing hasn't been bet-
ter since Dan Marino signed a
contract with the Miami Dolphins.
The main reason Williams’ loss has
not hurt as much as it might have is
that freshman Hosea Heard is pick-
ing up much of the slack. Heard
caught four passes in the first start of
his collegiate career,‘ including a
touchdown catch.

On one Pitt touchdown Saturday it
was not the receiver who caught the
attention of the crowd, but the passer.
Flanker Billy Osborn took a pitch
from Congemi and then lofted a
perfect pass to tight end Vernon Kirk
who was yards beyond the West
Virginia coverage.

”We have one trick play every
week,” Gottfried said.

So Pitt has easily disposed of one
of its two big rivals this year and gets
the monkey off its back for having not
beaten the Mountaineers since Hosea
Heard was a ninth grader in Valdosta,
Ga. Now if only the Penn State game
would be this easy.

right

By Mike Bodek

For The Pitt News

The action on the Pitt Stadium turf
is hot and heavy. At this point it is dif-
ficult to keep track of the movements
of each Pitt soccer player.

Then there is senior defender Kurt
Weber. He,is the player doing just
the right thing to help set up a Pan-
thers’ goal or prevent an opponents’
goal. In other words, he is a player
who is always in the right place at the
right time.

’’I guess l am that type of player,”
said Weber, a statistics major from

. Shaler High School. ”After a game,

I'm not really satisfied with myself
because I make a lot of mistakes, but
[Coach] Joe [Luxbacher] has kept me
in the games, and it gives me con-
fidence. Maybe in a big game I'll do
the right thing at the right time, and
it will help lead us to a win."

Weber is considered to be a team
leader, yet he is not what one would
consider to be loud.

”Kurt.is a great person,” said Lux-
bacher. ”He always works hard and
has a tremendous attitude. Kurt is a
leader on the field, even though he
is not that vocal. Instead, he leads by
how he plays and by the things he
does.

”Kurt is well skilled and intelligent.
When it comes to making the right
decisions at the right time, he may be
the best we have."

The Panthers have had early season
success, but the entire team realizes
that the true tests will come once they
get into the meat of the schedule.
Weber is looking forward to that
chaHenge.

”The Marshall Tournament (Oct.
4-5) will be very interesting,” said
Weber. ”That’s because we'll see
three good teams there besides us,
namely Morehead State, Vanderbilt
and, of course, Marshall. That tour-
nament will be a good indication as
to how good of a team we really are.”

Time will tell about the ability of
the 1986 Pitt soccer team, just as it
has proven the ability of Weber as a
student. He has been selected to be
on the athletic director's honor roll
and dean's list. Naturally, Weber has
his sights set on the future.

’’I would like to do statistical
research,” said Weber. ”l guess my
main goal is to get a job with NASA,
maybe at their jet propulsion
laboratory in California.”
