But there are other. reasons
wily this country should now inaugu-

r'ate_‘a scientiﬁc ‘development of its ’

youth for possible ‘war‘s—the‘ by-pro-.
duct advantages. First and foremost
of these is the “physical development
of the race. Selectany acquaintance.
‘whom you knew before‘ he went into’
the army and look at him now.: ‘ You-‘
- will have a hard time ‘ﬁnding one out
of the. possible hundreds‘ you may
know who is not s_turdie,r,_ stronger.
‘-healthier than before he’ became a
soldier_ ‘His eye is clearer; his com-
plexion "is better.
‘ sult of’ regular living, systematic exer-
cise,‘proper rest, wholesome food well
prepared, ‘sanitary surroundings and
personal hygiene-’ He may be a young
man who has had better than the
average opportunities for education, a
home, where‘ comfort and reﬁnement
were in evidence andwhere plenty or
«temptingfood was had. Even so, the
above remarks,Vwith-~per_haps one per
cent exception,‘ are true. 'ISn’t this
alone argument enough fol-‘putting all
- young Americans through‘ a course of

army. trailling? -Isn’t this worth a .

year of their l.ives?. V V
Then, again, the a.vera.ge.American
boy is famous for wanting his own
‘ way; he is apt to think father and
~mother» are all right, but not‘quite up
to his standard; he does not take kind-
ly to their guidance and suggestiV_on———
in a word, he is ‘independent. A course
of army training instills discipline, and
the recipient ﬁnds that consi_.dera.‘tio_n
of others is necessary, Respectgfor
=.,.aul.horit‘y islnculcated. Can anyone
doubt. tha-_t,,with our lax‘ observance of
law, this will not help? . .
There is no-argument against the

v proposition thatwe all owe service to
our country in exchange for‘-‘the bene-
ﬁts derived. There can be no.3«1"g11-‘
ment with the observant again‘st“theV
beneﬁts, tothe individual, of military
training. _ 'i‘hcrefore, why consider_anY-
thing less than universal military
training for «all our boys? _ Substi-

AN, ECONOMICS, ’l4 GRAD
In the series of specialiarti-cles. f‘_A
History of Pittsburgh and" Western

 

Pennsylvania Troops in the War”lby

John_V. Hanlon, now sunning. in the
Sunday edition of the Pittsburgh
Press, tribute is paid Captain W. H.

, Allen, Jr., Econ, 1914 (Sigma Chi’).
who was cited for bravery and pro-,

moted from a. Lieutenantcy as a re-
sult of his unusual display of nerve
and soldierly ability in ‘the’ battles
with the Hun.‘ “Bill’.’ Allen is the
son of Colonel W. H. Allen, Sr., Ex.

COL, "78, of 6215 Fiftlvavenue, PittS- ’

iburgh, ‘and .a- brother’ of Captain

Winthrop M. Allen, Engr., ’16, who _-

has also been cited for bravery.
' .The Allen boys have taken a deep
interestin military affairs all their
life and “Bill” was foryears an of-
ﬁcer of the Highland. Cadets, a. crack
military organization ‘for the boys of
the East’En'd district. He attended
the ‘Annapolis Naval Academy for a
year before e,ntering'Pitt. /As an of-
ficer of theold Eighteenth Regiment
he servedon the-Mexican border and
when war was declared ‘on Germany
he went to‘ the Southern training
camps ’-as. a Lieutenantin that or-
ganization“. His record “Over There,”
has -been brilliant, indeed. Following
is Mr. Hanlon’s comment on the -feat
which won him promotion: A
Courpoil is on the edge of the forest of
Fore and into that magniﬁcent wooded tract

' the Germans ﬂed. Captain W. R. Dunlap,

of Pittsburgh, commander of Company E,
One Hundredand Eleventh Infantry, an'd_Cap—
tain Lucius M. Phelps of Oil City, com-
mander of Company G. One Hundred and
Twelfth Infantry, with their troops, led ‘the
advance ‘beyond Epieds and participated in‘
the capture of Courpoil and the adva ce into
the forest. -Captain Phelps for a t
the difficult. task‘ of leading an independent
force making ﬂank attacks on the enemy, to
the left of the main battering I'3.TU.\ Both
these officers so distinguished themselves in

. thisdiﬁicult ﬁghting that they were recom-
mended -for immediate advancement to the "

rank of ma;iors.. , -
'The Americans battled their way in little
‘groups into the edge of the forest and were
hanging on -to this fringe of the wooded area
-‘when night. fell. The forest seemed to be, an
almost impossible barrier and i‘t was decided
to be utterly hopeless to atxtempt to continue
advancing in the darkness.- . _ ‘
. '  . ' W'on,Pr,omoti_on. V 
It ivns”whil"e thew widely‘ ‘scattered groups
"were holding the fringe of -the forest after
nightfall that Liéutenantwilliam Allen, /Jr.,
of Company B, One Hundred and Eleventh
Infantry of Pittsburgh, so -distinguished..him-
self as to be recommended forlpromotion and
a medal. Owing to the" groups being sepa-
rated. it was necessary
should know their approximate‘position's' so
as to be able to dispose of the forces for a
renewal of the attack the next ‘morning;
Lieutenant Allen took. two privates -- along

- with a patrol of three men on- either side and

-set out to traverse the forest along the line
where, our groups were supposed to -be. The
‘lieutenant and his men always kept Within
speaking distance of each other and through-
.‘out the night carefully threaded their way.
They did not know what instant they might
stumble on Germans or be ﬁred on or thrust
through by their comrades.

It was described as a‘ hair-raising dare-
devil feat. When Lieutenant Allen found
.himself~ near other men he remained silent
until a muttered word or even such inconse-
quent things as the tinkle of a distinctly
American"-piece of equipment, or the smell
of‘ American tgobacco-entirely diiferent from
that: in the European armies~—let him know
his neighbors were friends. __Then a soft call
to establish his identity and make it safe for
him to approach and the lientenant secured
an idea. as to the location and‘-force of that
particular group. _ V

Just ‘at the first sign of the approaching
dawn Lieeutenant Allen and. his men crawled
back to the main American lines where in
.a shell-hole which the general was using as
headquarters he was able to sketch with the
aid of a pocket’ ﬂashlight .3. map which en-
abled his superiors to -plan the "attack. .'The-
plans thus made from the information gath-
-ered by’Lieubenant Allen worked with clock-
like precision and resulted in the Boche
being driven further into the woods.
