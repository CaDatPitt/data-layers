SFA Introduces

New Team Begins Practice
Today Under Eagle Eye
Of Campus Janitor

By Robert Ruttencutler

All out for the University's new
indoor sport-—shoo'ting the basket!
SFA is offering everyone a chance
for membership, in the new watse
basket team which will start practic-
ing today with the aid of 47 new
trash baskets located everywhere on
the campus. '

The idea is to promote a school-
wide Clean-Up Campaign to keep
those» candy wrappers, notes to your
girl, letters to the editor, and exami-
nation blueprints where they belong
-—in the waste basket. ‘. _

p SFA is quite‘ sure this will (SE-'

LECT ONE): (a) help prolong the
life of the janitors; (b) show the
University spirit in keeping the build-
ings and the campus even more beau-
tiful; (c) develop more basketball
players. Did you select the correct
answer? Well, it was (b)!

.In connection with (c), Doctor
-Carlson says he thinks “the Clean-
Up Campaign has got something
'there.’’ Accordingly, the Doctor will
be closely watching‘ thevtrash cans all
week for basket-shooting talent that
may be going undiscovered. The good
Doctor also said that he “hoped” the
Clean-Up Drive would be a big suc-
cess.

‘ So," beginning today,. SFA is en-
couraging everyone to demonstrate
his- basket-shooting ability as well as
the reliable school spirit, by keeping
the corridors and sidewalks clean.

— a'waste basket is aiding the Clean—Up

Works By ‘North Anieri.ca11
Artists Will Be Shown
In Novel Exhibition

H-y"Robert Brown 7
Nearly 200 pieces, selected from

the National CeramicExliibitioii, will 1’ ‘ ‘

be placed on display today by the

department of fine arts of the Uni; 
ve_rsi't_V. The exhibition, which holds '

the same rank in pottery shows as
does Carnegie lnstitute’s annual dis-
play in painting, will be open to

ruary 28, when it will be moved to
the San Diego l\'luse_um of Art.

In_ View of the comparative pub-
lic indifference vtoojpottery and cer-
amic work~in general, -a jury select-
ed from directors of some of the
country’s leading art museums voted
to send this exhibit on the road.
Works included have been judged
“on the basis of (lecorative, crea-
tive, technical qualities,” while the
ceramic sculpture is judged on the
basis of originality, as well as" its
sculptural qualities. _

Novel Exhibit ‘ p

“The show would be worth while
if it were only for its novelty,” W al-
ter Hovey, acting head of the de-
partment of fine arts, commented
last Friday.‘ “Some of the work is
good, some not so good. but it’s all
interesting. At present, we are
walking around the oﬂice on tiptoe,
as some of the sculpture is delicate.
and we don't want any law.:<uits on
our hands for breaking anything."

All of the pottery and ceramics
entered have been done. by North
American artists. - Mexican artists,
in particular. have contributed richly
to these two ﬁelds. and lzlieir work xvas
entered in the current display through
the Laboratory of Anthology of New
lllexico and the Museum of No1‘ther'11
A.1‘izona. The United States’ e.nt.ric.H
came through New York galleries and
the Cleveland Museum of Art.

There is plenty of variety i.n the
exhibit, ‘ranging from the nuniero'ns
plates and vases to sculptured fig-
ures. Among these are “Kentucky
Babe,” “Dixie Madonna,” “Cow Crit-
ter" and “Ghandi.” Some of the
work was completed by WPA artists.

MESS CALL!

Janitor Bemoans Clean-up
()5 Chocolate Samples

By Butch

“It's awful. Such a mess. You just
look---all down the hall,” said J.
Sales. Aluiiini llall janitor in a special
inteiwicw with a News reporter last
'i"riday.

Mr. Sales waved his arm inclusive-
ly. “Take a look at that,” he de-
clared, gesticulating. A

All through the halls were wrap-
pers, hundreds of them. Candy wrap-
pers from samples of a well knowr
brand of chocolate littered the halls.
several mixed up with cigarette but.t;:.
crumpled copies of The News, and
last semester’s notebooks.

Someone. it SGf;‘.l'i‘i.\‘ was appointcc’
to the position of distributor for th-;
candy people, and the distribution
was well taken care of.

“You know what I think,” Mr
Sales opined. running a handful of
ﬁngers through his hair. “I think all
the students are going to have acm-
by Monday. Or mebbe diabetes. It'll
serve them right.”

“By the way, Mr. Sales. will you
have a chocolate.” We prof‘fered_ up
a sample box.

“No, thanks, young man.
have one of mine.”

Journalisnz ‘Students Compile

Study Of State Newspapers

 

In a survey by members of the

class of Journalism 101 in editorial

‘vrltings taught by l_i0lJei1‘t  Graham, director of the University News Serv-
es and ll1;2l..l‘l.l(_‘l'0I' in Eiiglish, it was revealed that Pen,nsylvania"s average

newspaper reader buys a well-lialaiicetl paper. . .-
In direct coii'ti'adiction of the charge that contemporary newspapers are

“all crime and scandal,” the repoi‘t:.’\‘/
of the 15 students making the survey
indicated that feature stories and gen
eral news predominate all other news
types.

Basis for the study of the 13 daily
newspapers from cities, in the state,
with a population of approximately
50,000, was the number of column
inches devoted to individual subjects,
including display and classified ad-
vertising.

The study revealed the following
average percentages of newspaper
content:

General news ﬁlls 11.71 per cent;
feature stories, 12.50 per cent; poli-
tics and government, 2.58 per cent;
business, 2.64 per cent; comic strips,
8.27 per cent.

Crime and scandal, 2.14; police and
court, 1.39; editorials, 3.60; and so-
ciety, 6.37.

Slightly more than a third of the
newspapers studied by the student-=.
was ﬁlled with display advertising,
33.63 per cent. Classiﬁed advertising
ﬁlled 4.10 per cent of the average
paper.

Individual editors show wide varia-
tion in their choice of news for read-
ers, the students discovered,

The newspaper which printed the
most crime and scandal news also
printed ‘the largest amount of general
and business news. However, the
newspaper printing the least amount
of crime and scandal news, less than
one per cent, devoted the greatest
percentage to feature stories, but the
least amount to society news.

endeavoring to knock down a couple

of long-standing records in his ‘fa-

No beneﬁt will add to the attrac-
tiveness of Saturday’s meet, and
there will be no price of ad-mission.
Free tickets may be obtained at the
office of The News or from Carl
Olson.

Only one record-maker of former
years will be running Saturday. He
is Andy Lasky, holder of the best
time in the 50-yard high hurdles.
Lasky, however, will have to do some
tall traveling to keep ahead of Ken
Ryden, speedy sophomore timber top-
per, who set faster frosh marks last
year than Lasky was able to make
as a varsity hurdler.

Sprin Men Feature

A great duel is also expected be-
tween Red Tost, Woodruff and Alex
Leggin in the distance events, just a
little farther than Woodruﬂ’ can ﬁnd
it possible to _. sustain ‘his I‘ half-mile
speed. "

Glenn Coop.er, Ed Spitz, Dick Ma-
son, Art Thomas, "Ed -‘Routch and
Lasky will make a fast ra_ce out of

the sprint events, with a. good. proba-.

bility for new records. Arvil Flem-

ing, dusky sprinter of 1-934-35-36,,

holds the present records.

The News is today printing. an en-

Panther Mittmen
Show At Stadium

_ In Home Opener

Boxing fans will get their first
chance "to ‘see ‘the Panther mittmen in

action when the champion Penn State
team comes to -the Stadium for a
series of matches-tomorrow evening.

Defending champions of the East-
ern Intercollegiate‘. League, the Nit
tany ‘Lions will bring to Pittsburgh‘ 3
team which _Schricker’s men will be
hard put to stop.

Led by champions Frank Goodman
at 135 pounds and Sammy Donato at
145, the State team is highly favored.

Other glovemen from Penn State
are Alex Sopchak, 115; Allan Tap-
man, 125; Bill Soose, 155; Lou Ritzic,’
165; Nestor Kociubinsky, 175, and
Izzy Richter, heavyweight.

Schricker will use the same lineup

case Emil Halley -will ‘ﬁght in the

In Defeat

 

Two l‘itt. varsity tearns opened
their re zpeciive seasons Saturday
night most inauspicio11sl_v. While

Coach Carl 0lson’s irackmen were
failing to place in the Millrose
Games at New York, Coach Jack

Scl11'ickei"s boxers were ‘faring little
better, winning only two matches
from Catholic U. as they lost, -6-2.

While NYU‘s Jimmy Herbert was
wi_nning‘tl1e 600-meter run in 1:12.'6,
three seconds faster than The News
p1‘edict.ed, Johnny Woodruif, the
world’s ﬁnesi 800-meter man, was
ﬁnding an unfamiliar track, a bad
start, and a smart ﬁeld too much for
him as he ﬁnished a stride behind
Charlie Beetliam in ‘fourth ‘place.

Hopes for a Panther victory in the
mile relaywere lost almost immedi-
ately after the starting gun when
Art. Thomas dropped the baton. The
stickless Panthers ﬁnished third be-
hind Manhattan, repeat wim1er,.and
Holy Cross, but were subsequently
disqualiﬁed. Thomas, Alex Leggin,
Harold Tost, and Woodrufl’ lined up
for Pitt in that ordm‘.

And down in W»a;sl1i11gl;on, only
Ralph Ca.ruso at 125 pounds and Art
Leonard at 175 managed to squeeze
out decisions over the Flying Cardi-
nals of Catholic U. Ray Bombe at
165 did some great toe--to-toe punch-
ing with Sully Greco of the Washing-
tonians, but Greco got the referce’s
nod. ~

 ’  Good Forum l

‘S’ WED begi1"1li‘ltl1e"SeCO11Cl half ‘of the’: current
. ‘University year, it should____be' noted that
CYM-YWCA, co-sponsors of Inquiry Forum, have

handled their project competently and. impar-

tially thus far. Their purposes and policies have
-been consistent-with "those of true educational
democracy in stimulating the minds of students.
Opportunity for this stimulation has been pro-‘
vided each "Monday at 12:30 o’clock in Alumni
Hall. "Especially has this been true during the

past semester, .w'_ith the.-speakers corresponding’

-to many of those presented by the Community
Forum," which is conducted by"D_r. C-lausen-_in
..Schenley high scho.ol..ea_ch-.I‘»_/Ionday evening. 

‘ Some students‘ question whether or not reli-
Jgious 'o‘rg.aniza~tions-such’. as the co-sponsors of
.'the Forum should promote such.a"ventur'e. Since,
~good religion_. is ,e-ss,ent_i,a1l_y respect for people
and“ the interest in promoting better human-..rc-
lations; since spiritual implications -ofithe sub-
jects discussed at the Forums can be appropri-
ately-made; and since an appraisal‘_of the list of
speakers during the past year shows an equal
number of “Lefts” and"‘Rights” and “Centers,”
_.we feel that Inquiry Forum is clearly within the
scope of reli-gious organizations. Let us hope
that this policy is continued.

" HE first reactionhto President Roe-sevelt’s

In llatesrt messageililtoi Congress concerning the
appointment of_ Federal judges is one of marked
amazement. Since the Schcchter decision out-
lawed the NRA, the entire nation has been won-
dering just how long the President would wait
before taking up the challenge laid down by the
Supreme Court. Obviously, the fondest hopes
of the most rabid opponent of the Court should
be satisﬁed by the "‘President’s recent action.

The most likely thing is that thecry of “dic-
tator-” will be raised immediately. Possibly it has
been raised alreadys There is certainly an un-
precedented situation occasioned by the Presi-
.dent’s determined action, but considering that
most people are just about fed up with adverse

Supreme Court decisions, there seems ‘to be

slight cause for worry.

Undoubtedly, the power to appoint up to 50
Federal judgesin one year invested in the Presi-
dent. is likely to be abused at some time in the

—future, but acc'ording.‘to the results of last No-

_vernber’s election we may believe-that the Presi-

dent  merely‘ - fulﬁlling" “a‘ mandate of the

people.” A -

The “one, regret that is uppermost in the minds
offorrner critics of the Court ‘is that “good”
judgesas well as “bad” judges will be. affected
equally by this bill, if-it is enacted. For instance,
much regret will befelt against the “forced”
withdrawal of such menas Chief justice Hughes.
or Justice Brandeis, two of the most progress-i'-_rc
Justices, who consistently consider socially im-

portant aspects of a caseias well as strict legal,

aspects. .
