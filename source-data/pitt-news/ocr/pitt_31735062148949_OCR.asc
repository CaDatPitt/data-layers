S t u d e n t Congress an-
nounced that applications for
Union Board or Union Com-
mittee positions are available

. in the Dean of Men’s office‘

and the Dean of Women’s of-

ﬁce and at the Student Desk.
These applications are due Nov.
at the Student Union oﬂice.

Student Congress also voted a
recommendation to Dr. Peake, as-
sistant chancellor of student af-
fairs, to complete his offer to re-
move the “Keep Our Campus
Clean” signs from the lower cam-
pus. I

In a report to’ Congress Presi-
dent Phil Parkinson, Col. ’58, ex-
plained the intended purpose of
the signs was to discourage lit-
tering of the campus by outsiders

and to make more people aware.

of the fact that buildings other
than the cathedral are an integral
part of the Pitt campus.

Pep Assembly

I ., A pep assembly featuring the

Homecoming Queen and her court
will be staged for Friday, at 12:30
p.m. on the Schenley Terrace. Co-
chairman, Tom Ribich, Col. ’60,
and Mike Altman, Col. ’60, have
also requested that the Commons

Room be used if inclement
weather results.
Student Problems Committee

Chairman Betty Chiappetta, Ed.
'58, reported the progress of her
committee in channeling the stu-
dent gripes to proper authorities
' for consideration.

In a request for more ade-
quate lighting in the Commons
Room, the Physical Plant De-
partment is now experimenting

. s to improve the lighting without

detracting from the Gothic

beauty.

The Physical Plant Department
also is answering another request
from the student suggestion box
by adding additional water foun-
tains on the lower ﬂoors and de-
veloping a central cooling system.

Virginia Campbell,_ a' non-de— N

gree student, won a ticket to the
Homecoming Dance with‘ ‘the
name “Pitt Peeve” for the stu-
dent gripe box at the student
desk. Suggestions submitted in the
“Pitt Peeve” box will be con-
sidered for further appropriate ac-
tion by the Student Problem com-
mittee.

A bonﬁre slated for Friday eve-

rning was cancelled due to the

streetcar strike, open houses, and
ﬂoat construction.

Howard Rossen, Col. ’58, ap-
pointments chairman, extended
the deadline for Student Dis-
counts Chairman applications to
Friday, Nov. 1.

 Replaces
WSGA in Vote

On Name Issue

The title Associated Wom-
en Students was approved
last week by the former
Women’s Self Government
Association to replace: the
name of the thirty—seven year
old organization.

Out of 268 ballots marked in the .

recent election only eleven were
cast against the proposed name
change and other revisions in the
by-laws. _

President Christine Taylor, Col.
’58, stated that the new name will
go into effect- immediately without
further formal announcement

Another change included add-
ing to the executive committee
the representative to the Inter-
collegiate Associatign of Women
Students. The clause concern-
ing this appointment was form-
erly under legislative power.

The section heading entitled
Legislative Power has
amended to Policy-making power.
In her explanation of the resolu-
tions before the Commission,
Gladys Flesher, Ed. ’58, Chief
Justice of Senior Court, gave the
following reason. “The word legis-
lative is misleading since Com-
mission is a policy making body
and not a legislative body.

Two committees were dropped
from the by-laws. The first,
High School Relations, no longer
functions. Polaris Committee
was also deleted because this
area is now handled by Student
Congress.

Vocational Conference Commit-
tee was renamed Community Re-
lations because the title pertained
to the work done by the Univer-
sity Placement Bureau under Dr.
Paul Sherwood, director.

Midday Series Features

Psychologist Tomorrow

Dr. Hadley Cantril, social psychologist, will speak tomor-
row at 12 p.m. in Stephen Foster Memorial on the topﬁ, “The
Search for Faith: The Communist Protest Voter in Europe.”

The purpose of the Institute for International Social Re-
search, of which Dr. Cantril is co-director, is “to study sys-

relationships.”
The Institute’s official state-
ment asserts: “Inthe last an-
alysis, diplomacy, treaties, ec-
onomic and business relation-
ships, military programs and al-
liances are all concrete mani-
festations of the psychological
needs, interests, ‘and aspirations

of human beings.”

this area and this committee does
not attempt to do the same type

of work, it has been suggested
that -the committee name be
changed so that we will not be
confused with that area.”-

The Women’s Self Government
Association was organized on the
Pitt campus in 1920. It grew out
of the Women’s Activities Asso-
ciation, begun in 1912.

Organizational membership in
the early days of WSGA was
limited to the following: a glee
club sponsored by the School of
Education; athletic council :
Panhellenic Council; Women's
Debating Society; and YWCA.
Cwens and Mortar Board soon
entered.

At present AWS sponsors lead-
ers seminars, orientation, and tra-
ditions, as well as having Senior
Court, and representatives from
the cfasses and all women's activi-
ties.

Therefore, “The psychological
factors involved in relations be-
tween peoples are profoundly
"molded and affected by political.
economic, social, and internation-
al conditions.

The psychological consequ-
ences of these conditions on
human beings must be discov-
ered if the real dynamics of in-
ternational relationships are to
be understood and their course
effectively guided.”

Dr. Cantril will analyze the
large Communist vote in France,
Italy, and other European coun-
tries. He will present some of the
ﬁndingsof the program being
carried on by the Institute for In-
ternational Social Research, of
which he is co-director, and
chairman of the Board of Trus-

proach stimulating. Moreover,
they will be attracted by his
warm and friendly manner,”
assures Dr. Charles H. Peake,
assistant chancellor of student
affairs.
' Dr. Cantrill will be in the
lounge of the Student Union for
informal discussion at 3 p.m. All
interested persons are invited to

‘/l~Ch€ISI Money ids Various Proj

Chest Drives Help
Elevate Standards
Of Less Fortunate

(Editor’s Note: This is the
second in a series of three
articles explaining where Pitt
Chest money goes. This article
deals with funds,-allocated to
students other than those at
Pitt.) ,

By LINDA KOHL
‘ When Pitt students pledge
their money to the Pitt Chest

drive on Nov, 11 to 15, one of

 {the areas to which their dona-
 tions will go is that designat-

ed for “Other Students.”

This category includes ‘two main
divisions, the National Scholarship
Service and Fund for Negro Stu-
dents (NSSFNS) and the World
University Service (WUS).
Basic Purpose
“ T NSSFNS was "established in
31947 with the basic purpose of
r “broadening and increasing oppor-

tunities for qualiﬁed Negro stu—.

dents for higher education in an

inter-racial environment.”
Supported mainly through con-

tributions from college chest

drives, this service has aided ap— ”

:.‘proximately 5000 Negro students.

  

The NSSFNS does not grant

V cholarships directly to such
tudents; _it supplies Negro
youth with information con-

cerning available scholarships.
Then if the student is still ﬁ-
nancially unable to attend
school, the fund awards outright
money grants. '
Last year the basic policy of the

 organization was modified to at-
’ tack the problem of the increasing

ineligibility of applicants because
of an impoverished cultural and
intellectual environment.
I Directors Dissatisiﬁed

The Board of Directors was dis-
satisﬁed with the results of ap-
proaching the students in the sen-

'9 ior high school and agreed that

 

“the effects of low-motivation and

eecnomic and cultural depriva-

tion would inevitably have al-
ready set in.”

The new policy recognizes the
need felt by the administrators of
NSSFNS’ reaching Negro youth
earlier than the senior high level.
Today the plan emphasizes the
need for early educational stimu-
lation and counseling of students
from deprived groups in the jun-
ior high school. v

Illustrative of the new plan
is the completion of the first
year of a six-year demonstra-
tion project in Junior High
School No. 43, Manhattan. M0-
tivation of Negro children to-
wards high cultural and aca-‘

_’ Jgemic goals is a key feature of

Negro Students, and the World University.Service. The drive will

this undertaking.

Other aspects of the newly de—.
veloped objectives include em-
phasizing the need of the teacher
in identifying able students, rais-
ing cultural sights (music, art,
theatre, community), preparing
pupils for cultural experiences,
and education of the parents to-
wards cooperation. '

Students Beneﬁt
Several students now attending

Pitt have benefited from this aid.

Supplementary scholarship awards
are given to Alpha Kappa Alpha
and Delta,Sigma Theta, both so-
rorities on the Pitt campus.

The Community Talent Search
of the NSSFNS is yet another
phase of the new goals of the or-
ganization. CTS is “a project to

assist communities in identifying .

and developing their able children
from less privileged /groups re-
gardless of race or creed.”

The NSSFNS seeks not only

. to educate Negro youth on the

college level, but alsoiis instru-
mental in Negroes’ gaining of
scholarships to outstanding pre-
paratory schools, graduate and
professional schools.

The other charity to which Pitt
students will donate in the No-
vember campaign of Pitt Chest is
the World University Service.

A non-sectarian and non—poli-
tical organization, WUS is spon-
sored by such groups as the Hillel
Foundation, the Newman Club,
and the YM-YWCA groups, and is
affiliated with the United Nations

Economic and Social Council and
(UNESCO).

Aid to A Refugees

Contributions from Pitt students
will go towards foreign student
health and housing, educational
equipment and materials for
needy _universities, aid to student
refugees, and supplying students
and professors with food and
clothing. —

Administration of WUS is cen-
tered both in a world-wide Gen-
eral Assembly and in General
Committees in the various mem-
ber nations. In the United States
the General Committee includes
representatives of the sponsoring
agencies and also some members-
at—large.

Students, from all countries
contribute towards the support
of WUS, no matter what the
economic condition of their par-
ticular country.

Emphasized by WUS is the con-
cept that aid is given to those who
will help themselves. An example
of this idea was shown when

Korean students recently attended '

the dedication of their new uni-
versity, built with twenty cents
contributed by each student and
auxiliary aid from WUS.

Students throughout the United
States activate drives with the re-
turns going either wholly or par-
tially to WUS. Several years ago
girls from nearby Chatham Col-
lege set up a car-washing business
in Oakland to raise money for
WUS.

'ODK man-of-the-year program prevented

— There have been more than idle rumblings lately about the
re-establishment of the Senior Queen idea at Pitt. .

There has also been, for years, an increasingly confused view

of the PITT NEWS stand on this very important topic. Through con-

 stant misunderstanding and misquotation the stand of the news-

paper has been taken as adverse to the idea of honoring a senior
woman as exemplary of ‘the ideals of Pitt womanhood. It is time
now for some plain“ talk. -

h_First of all, it is safe to stateafter diligent research through the
ﬁles back to 1945 that NEVER has the NEWS said anything against
the tradition of Senior Queen.’ The objection has been only to the
MEANS of selection and honoring of the Queen.

{I In a column appearing on Jan. 7, over a month before the
abolition of Coronation and the Queen, Irv Rothman, former editor
of the NEWS stated, “She (the Queen) is recognized for high char-
acter, academic achievement, and extra-curricular accomplishment
‘T. . . this is an important manifestation of University ideals.”

The column further suggests that “it is not too soon to consider
these necessary changes in the annual program to honor the very
important Senior Queen.” , .

So it can be readily understood that the PITT NEWS has tra-
ditionally stood in favor of the award with only those changes
which would make theselection and honoring of this outstanding
senior democratic and public. ‘

And the selection was not overt but contrarily by dark processes
and obscure methods unknown to the greater majority of senior
women. The nominations were public and open, but from there on
the selection was by methods so well-hidden as to put the Polit-
boroito shame. ~

The selection should be by a group of women who are them-
selves outstanding in these virtues. It should be by democratic open
nomination andﬂwritten ballot. The votes should be counted in the
presence of the members of the selecting group. And this group
should honor their selection. .. ‘

This could be done at an affair similar to Rose’ Tea if this party
could be expanded out of the conﬁnement of the function of a
“ceremony” and into the idea of a reception for their choice. As
the above quoted column says, “. . . lest we criticize destructively

. . . may we offer in exchange the American custom-—the digniﬁed,

informal, but often erudite banquet.” A reception should be spon-
sored by the selecting group and attended by the entire_V',senior’class.
Andsince this woman does represent the ideals of Pitt woman-
hood she should be given a chance to speak her mindff on a topic
of her choosing. This would be a program worth und*eiitaking.
The senior women obviously desire a program of this type.
After the abolition of the Queen tradition last year','.fa series of
meetings of the senior class was held to ﬁnd a substitute for the
missing custom. Since fear of being accused of copying from the
honest consideration of
ideas, the meetings were fruitless. “ ' _“;:‘-J -
V The reasons given ‘at the time for the abolition of" Queen were
that no one individual represented the ideals of the Queen and that
senior women were too mature to be anxious for the honor of Queen.
VBoth of these reasons are feeble and untrue. There is no harm
in honoring a single woman as outstanding in the opinion of her
fellows. There was, admittedly, no wisdom" in presenting? one woman

‘ as outstanding in the opinion of the Unknown who was Selector.

A “Second class 3 mail

Further, there should be no motivation foriany womah to wish for

the honor but there should be (and is) an anxiety for the senior
class to honor one of their number forithese achievements.

‘If anything positive is done in the re-establishment of the
honoring of a senior woman (not under the mocking title of Queen
but of more sincere name) then this publication stands ready to
assist and support. ,

It would do justice to the senior women and the University
to show that there is such achievement- among our women.

What’s the answer to this streetcar strike any-"

It is certainly tr_ue_ that our

to the problem. It has been
found by some students in fact

and the federal and state mediators are powerless

The negotiations seem bogged down, neither

Letters To The Editor  

Editor, The Pitt News;
The distracting "‘Let’s Keep

certainly have been more service-
able last year. Then the reporters
of Time magazine would not have
needed to travel to the Oakland
railroad tracks to photograph our
beautiful Cathedral of Learning.
_ A snapshot of the Cathedral
bordered by said signsjwould have
served their purpose just as well.

One important point has yet to '

Homecoming.

The local footballers found that their invasions on suc-

The opposition at Army
Notre Dame was obviously wait-
ing for the attack and opened up
on the Jungle Cats with both bar-
rels. And hunting season has just
opened!

,1 Now with a‘ record of three wins
and a like number of defeats, the
Blue and Gold will initiate a home
stand of three games with the aim
pf, recouping waning prestige. An
“old, grad” crowd of upwards of

V 45,000 will be on hand for the 1:30

kickoff. _

' Orangemen Seek Revenge

T-he visiting warriors from New
York, under the watchful super-
‘vision of Ben Schwartzwalder,
come to the bowl on the hill with
a '3-1-1 record. They lost to the
redoubtable Lions of Penn State

. last Saturday and were tied by

Iowa State in the season lid-lifter.
The Skyscraper U. operatives
were the victors in last year’s
tangle with the Orangemen, by
a slim 14-7 score. As is so often
the case with the Panthers, that
score hardly signiﬁed the clear
superiority of the locals in that
game. There is a feeling among‘
qualiﬁed observers that the
Blue and Gold will be out to
earn a clear-cut victory on
Saturday. 1
That old reliable subject of the
physical condition of the gridders
must be examined again. The tale
is a good deal like that of former
pre-game sick lists this campaign
-—a gloomy one. The leg miseries
have hit the squad again.‘Par-
tially disabled this week for prac-
tice sessions are Ends Bo Zanos
and Art Gob, Guard Ed Michaels,
and Back Jim Theodore.
Injuries Plague Panthers
In addition, starting tackle Ron
Kissel is still sidelined due to his
sacroiliac condition. The aching
back which put him into the hos-
pital and out of the Notre Dame
game is painful, as yet. His re-
placement, sophomore Ernie
Westwood is over the ﬂu and

ready to step into the apparent
gap. However, Ken Montanari
may get the starting assignment
because of his good work at South
Bend. ‘

JOE PULLEKINES

Head coach John Michelosen
has been plagued since the be-
ginning of fall practice by the
injury jinx. He readily admits
that more players have been out

able, sound personnel has plut a
serious crimp in the practice
routine of the Panthers.‘

The offensive threat of the
Panthers was at a new season
high during the Notre Dame
game. Although able to tally but
a single six-pointer, the local ‘at-
tack was rolling more smoothly
than at any time this year. The al-
ternating of Quarterbacks Bill
Kaliden and Ivan Toncic had
something to do with. this "im-
provement. In addition, the Blue
and Gold defensive patterns have
been slightly altered to better
contain a sliding offense.

The home towners are anxious
to see how battle—scarred the
Jungle Cat is with the sudden ad-
vent of hard times. But they may
ﬁnd that his claws are newly
sharpened and ready for the con-
ﬁdent invader.

Syracuse Tries
F or Revenge

By MURRAY CHASS

In the record books ‘they’re
marked down as the i 1956
Lambert Trophy champs. «But
in the minds of Panther fol-
lowers and other unbiased
studentsof the grid game, the
Syracuse Orangemen represent
just another team, on the locals’
ten-game schedule. .

In fact, these Eastern titlists
promise to give the Panthers a
weaker battle than at least half
the other teams on the latter’s
schedule. Just for the sake of
“good copy” the Orangemen were
being touted to repeat as Lambert
winners until Penn State downed
Syracuse last Saturday.

Before that contest the Orange-

men had pushed through four

games undefeated. They had got-
ten off to a rocky start when Iowa
State tied them, 7-7. But in their
next three games they picked "up
and somehow convinced Eastern
sportswriters that they were likely
repeaters as champs in this sec.-
tion of the football world.

Syracuse Misses Brown

The Orangemen outscored Bos-
ton U., 27-20; they shut out Cor-
nell, 34-0; and their third. win
was over Nebraska, 26-9. Then the
Staters sent their dreams afﬁut-
tering with a_ 20-12 triumph.

Nevertheless, the Orangeinen
willibe at Pitt Stadium to show
at least Panther fans that they
are worthy of that symbolic
trophy. Just how they will show
this is another story.

Last year Syracuse threatened
the Panthers with All-American
Jimmy Brown. However, even
that amazing fellow. co‘uldn’t
break through the locals’ _'defense.
And if Brown couldn’t do it, how
can anyone expect his replace-
ments to manage this feat?

Cofﬁn Stars

The only back given half a
chance to make_any headway for
the Orangemen this Saturday is
Fullback Ed Cofﬁn, their leading
ground gainer. It may be granted
that Coﬁin is as ﬁne a runner as
the Panthers have, but last week's
tussle with the Nittany Lions
proved that he has little o-r no
support.

In fact, Coffin scored both

Long Runs Ruin Cub Gridders

As Navy Plebes

Win Tilt, 25.13

By LARRY HAGGERTY

Navy’s Plebes shot out front on Bob Hardison’s 70 yard
run for a touchdown‘ inrthe second quarter and were never
headed as they handed Coach Steve Petro’s Panther freshmen
their second straight defeat 23-13 at Annapolis.

Hardison added a second six-pointer on a one yard
plunge in the third quarter. Joe Bellino, the Tar’s leading

rusher, ran '52 yards for a score0

in the second period, and Jim
McCune, a reserve back, raced 17
yards for a tally in the last stanza.

The Blue and Gold scored in"
the dying moments of each half.
Fred Cox plunged one yard just
before the intermission and
John Sakal duplicated that ef-
fort as the contest neared its
end Ron Delﬁne added the ex-
tra point as he took a pass from
Sakal.

S a k a l and Ed Schrockman
showed a tremendous passing
game at quarterback for the

Panther yearlings, who gained
142 yards through the air to only
17 for Navy. However, the Sailors
advanced 487 yards rushing to
the Skyscraper’s 205.

Although Navy gained over 500
yards against the Panthers, the
gridders, with the "exception of
the four long runs, were able to
halt the Tar drives at the op-
portune time on each occasion.
Nevertheless the Navy defense

contained the freshman backs too.

The Panthers, were able to
gain much more ground against
Navy as compared toithe open-
ing game with Penn State. In
both games the passing attack
has been exceptionally ade-
quate, but the ground game at
Annapolis proved to be a"’pleas-
ant surprise. ~ .

“If I can get the squad to prac-
tice hard this week, I am positive
the boys will be able to end the

CHUCK ZIMMERMAN

 

Syracuse Quarterback

¢

Syracuse touchdowns on passes.
He took one for 15 yards and a
second for 13. He also snagged
a 37-yard‘ aerial to set up his
ﬁrst six-pointer. . _ _
Surely Coffin can’t do every-
thing for the Orangemen game
after game. It is true that Quar-
terback Chuck Zimmerman’s
passes have been ﬁnding other
targets than Cofﬁn, but the State
game was Syracuse’s ﬁrst real test
and no one but the senior full-
back came through.
Lasse All-American Candidate
Even though their passing total
showed ten completions for 18
tries, it was evident that most of
Zimmerman’s tosses were of the
too—hot-to-handle variety, which
didn’t help any.

Besides Cofﬁn, Zimmerman’s
top targets have been Ends Dick
Lasse and Glenn Preising. Lasse
has been considered by pre-sea-
son experts as a top candidate
for All-American honors.

The halfbacks/for 7Saturday’s
game will be a. pair of juniors,

Tom Stephens and Dan Fogarty.
Stephens ranks second thus far
in rushing and also is among the
ﬁrst four pass receivers.

Orangemen Behind In Series _

From tackle to tackle Syracuse
has ﬁve lettermen. Tackles are
Ron Luciano and Chuck Strid (a
starter from last year), guards are
Gerry Hershey and Alex Bene-
cick, and the center is Mike Bill.
Of these only Strid and Bill are
seniors.

The Orangemen have beaten
the Panthers only twice in their
twelve—game series. Actually
the heated rivalry that has de-
veloped ' between these two
teams is of recent vintage since
the series was given a 25-year
rest from 1930 to 1955. In 1955
Syracuse lost, 25-12, and last
year’s score was 14-7.

Orangemen: Keep the Lambert
Trophy at home and look at it as
much as possible. It won’t be
around much any more.

Tirnon’s Loss May Hurt
Harriers Victory Streak

Hopes for a Panther cross country victory over Penn
State Saturday received a staggering blow Monday when

Vince Timon, leading runner

for Carl Olson’s harriers ﬁn-

ished second behind the “ﬂu bug.” , A .
Timon, a slender built junior, who ﬁnished ﬁrst in a
meet ‘between Navy, Georgetown, and Pitt last Saturday, was

ordered to the West Penn H

ospital early Monday by team

physician Dr. A. K. Smith after it was learned that he had

become ill Sunday evening,

The loss of Timon has deﬁ-
nitely put a damper on Panther
visions for a win over the
powerful State runners. The
former Erie High School runner
had been a spark-plug in the
locals’ four meets to date. He
had ﬁnished in the top spot
twice, and had also ﬁnished in
second place twice.

Minus Timon, the locals will
send a’ young contingent of run-
ners led by sophomores Ron Rush,
George Walters, and John Christof,
a junior. Penn State, who has de-
feated Navy and Cornell ‘this sea-
son, will counter with a powerful
team led by three outstanding
juniors: Fred Kerr, John» Moran,
and Clem Shoembeclé;

In the Navy meet on Saturday,
Navy ﬁnished first with 22 points.
Pitt was second with 37, and
Georgetown trailed in third place
with 74 points.

Timon won, this race as he ﬁn-
ished 60 yards in front of his
nearest opponent. His time for the
4.5 mile course was 26:05. Rush
placedlﬁfth with a time of 26:59.
Navy, however, showed outstand-
ing team strength as they cap-
tured second, third and fourth
places.

 Booters Host Br ockport
In Homecoming Contest

B)’ JIM LACEY

A concentrated scoring punch helped the Booters to a 4-0
victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes last Saturday at the
Stadium. This was the ﬁfth consecutive victory for the Blue

and Gold.

After a scoreless first period Jerry Bressanelli banged
home the first goal on a penality shot that goalie Mike Grosz
a stop. LeeO

had no chance for
Goodman garnered the second
goal on a pass from Jack Horox.
The Blue and Gold lost little
time in breaking the game wide
open in the third quarter. Chuck
Kane beat goalie Grosz on a pass
from Dick Hopkins at the two
minute mark. Bill Kovalchick
ﬁnished the scoring late in the
third quarter as he tipped in a
goal on a pass from Horox.

Defense Test Slated

From this point to the end of
the game the defense of the Be-
mismen held the Buckeyes in
check. They had only one scoring
threat which came on a penalty
shot. Hans Lesheim sent the shot
toward the net but it was deftly
stopped by sub-goalie Paul Cian-
cutti.

Coach Bemis is well pleased
with the progress of the team
and particularly the defense.
The defense will get a strong
test in the next five games be-
cause the opponents are rated
tops in Collegiate Soccer.

“The passing is still ragged and
the heading of the ball is poor.
These things will have to be cor-
rected before we play Brockport,”
asserts Bemis.

Veteran Eagles Next

The next opponent for the
Booters will be the Brockport
State Teachers, National Co-
Champs two years ago.

Besides Hughes and Johnson
the Eagles will ﬁeld a team filled

sophomores. Frank Wilhelm. Dave
Miller, and Barry Fisher make
up the sophomores contingent on

. the team.

Goga on Shut-Out Streak
Eric von Schiller and Fred
Taube are two Senior outside
linemen that the Bemismen will
have to watch. Rollo Haufmyer
and Warner Prissing give the

Eagles a top pair of goalies.

The Brockport Eagles, coach-
ed by Huntley Parker, will be
played as part of the Home-
coming Celebration at Kennard
Field at 10 a.m.

Ron Goga, the Panther’s,regular
goalie, has racked up his second
consecutive shut-out and will be
trying to make it three in a row.

The rest of the Blue and Gold
starting lineup will be intact and
ready for the Eagles since there
were no major injuries in the
last tilt. -

With only ﬁve games played the
Bemismen have already bettered
their last year’s win record of
four.

JIM McCUSKER
Brusing Panther Tackle

 

X Gridder Takes Social Program
, ‘ Seriously As Well As Football  

By JANICE KLEIN
Jim McCusker, who is known to be quiet and reserved off
the football ﬁeld, takes a strong stand where school campus
life is concerned. The “big” boy from Jamestown, New York

says, “Pitt has many assets’
or I would not have chosen to
way to go to compete with
some of the campus schools
around the country.

VVe need a school social pro-
gram that cen‘.ei*s around more
than the fraternities and sorori-
ties. One that can serve the “av-
erage Joe” as well the select few.
Where are all the school planned
activities‘? We are acquiring the
facilities for a campus school,
what we need now is to put them
to good use.”

The Panther co-captain takes
more than school problems
seriously. Anyone who has at-
tended the teams practice ses-
sions or seen Jim in action
knows football is also serious
business to him. “Big Mac” is
’ one man on the team who shows
his potential at all times; at
practice and at game time. t

Even though Jim is the biggest
man on the team he runs like

least he has a bad psychological
effect on the opposing line be-
cause of his size. When the biggest
of the Five Jumbos gets rolling
even the ﬁercest opponent doesn‘t
like to be in his way.

Jim has come along way from
last year when he could not even
take the starting position away
from Herman Canil. This year he
has been a regular for Coach
Michelosen playing the full sixty
minutes invalmost every game. He
has been so outstanding that he
is now a candidate for All-Amer-
ican and a sure bet for the All-
East team.

At Jamestown High where
Jim was graduated he starred at
the tackle position. When he
graduates from the School of
Business Administration in June
he will not desert the football
ﬁeld, for he hopes to play -pro
ball. From his college record he
should not have any difficulty
being drafted by the pro’s. After
a few years of pro ball Jim
hopes to pursue his ambition
which is business management.

Next football, Jim ﬁnds
wrestling the most» interesting
sport. However, his life is not all
sports. When he goes out the
eligible Mr. l\/lcCuskcr likes danc-
ing, the movies, (a good comedy)
and anything that has to do with
outdoors. He is a member of the
Panther Club and eagerly awaits
their annual picnic. '

to

The Panthers will_lose a valu-
able player when Jim graduates,
and Coach Michelosen will have
to look far and wide for some-
one to take his place.

IF Playoffs Begin
With Kappa, Delis
On Top With Wins

Delta Sigma Phi fraternity drew
a bye into the second round of
the I-F Football Playoffs last
Monday while Delta Tau Delta
and Pi Kappa Alpha fraternities
advanced into the second round
by scoring one-sided preliminary
round wins.

The Delta Sig's, by virtue of
their narrow 6-0 win over Phi Ep-
silon Pi fraternity, ﬁnished league
competition with a perfect 5-0
record and thus garnered the right
to the second round bye.

The Delta Sig-Phi Ep contest
was highlighted by hard defen-
sive play on the part of both
teams. The only score in the
contest came late in the third
period when Chuck O’Donnell
counted on a 12 yard end run.
The play had been set up earlier
by a 40 yard pass from O’Don
nell to Woody Herman.

Delta Tau Delta advanced to
the quarter ﬁnals by defeating

Sigma Pi 19-0. Husky‘ Jim Dona-

hue scored twice on runs of 15
and 20 yards to lead the Delts.

George Schoepner scored two
touchdowns ‘on runs of 20 and four
yards, and passed for two others,
as Pi Kappa Alpha eliminated
Omega Psi Phi from the tourna-
ment 27-0.

 

   

iiii-rturt.

  

     

   

An amusing incident was injected into the seriousness
of the Notre Dame-Panther tilt this past Saturday. With three

seconds remaining in the half,

the Panthers called for a time

out in an attempt to set up a touchdown play. Frank Reyn-
olds, Notre Dame halfback, looked up at the score. board and
noticed that no time remaining was registered. He ran off

the ﬁeld and the whole student¢

body yelled in an attempt to turn
him back.

It wasn’t until he reached the
tunnel leading to the dressing
room than an interested fan told
him to return to the playing field.
He looked around and saw that he
was playing a solo and quickly
rejoined the party out on the
field.

* *\*

Some of the Notre Dame coach-
ing staff will think twice before
turning away a football prospect
because he may be .too small in
his freshman year. Ken Monta-
nari and Joe Pullekines, who
played bang up ball for the Jungle
Cats, were looked over by the
Irish in High School but were
turned down bids because of their
size.

Carroll “Beano” Cook marveled.”

over a piece of paper handed him
at the Stadium at South ‘Bend.
The piece of paper, made up by
Charlie Callahan the Irish Sports
Publicity Director, was called an
“IF” Sheet. On it were all the
possibilities of new records the
Irish may set “IF” they should
win and all the possibilities “IF"
they should lose. They won.
“Beano” is now going to try the
same thing.
