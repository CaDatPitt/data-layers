The primary purpose of the Cen-

Elevator am

Continues

The ground floor of the Cathedral
began to take on an induction sta-

_ tion atmosphere today as the cur-
*;, tailed elevator service remained in

effect for the second week.

Many students reported difficulty
in getting to their classes on time.
One student likens the elevator ser-
vice to a “case of hardened art-
eries."

The reduced service went into
effect Jan. 8 when two of the 19 op-
erators were laid off. According to

, University officials the layoffs were

caused by a wage boost and the
soaring cost of materials. Ten jan-
itorial workers were cut from the

. staff at the same time.

Chancellor Rufus ll. Fitzgerald
denied that the layoffs were due to
any general economy move. He-
said that the cuts were made to
maintain the present budget.

The Chancellor pointed out, how-
ever, that the expected droP in 90'
rollment would undoubtably cause
an economy drive in all departments.
Sixty percent of the University's in-
come is derived from tuition, he ex-

 , plaired.

No Quorum“

So SC Talks

Student Congress -started work on
spring election plans at its last
meeting. I

Roy Titchworth presented this
tentative election calendar for the
approval of Congress:

May 4--Last day to hand in Con-
gress petitions.

May 6--The‘Congress nominating
‘committee meets to pass on the pe-
titions.

May 7--Women’s Clearing House.

May ll--Women's elections.

May 18--Congress elections(men
and women). '

No vote was taken on the calen-
dar proposal since a quorum was
not present. The meeting, one of the
shortest on record(4S mirutes) was
hustled along by the absence of well
over half the Congressmen and a
dozen committee reports.

It was announced by Andy Schur-

man that Varsity Day would be held
during Spring Festival week, replac-
ing Tap Day which was moved to

Students, Faculty
Get Invited to
Policy Talk

A frank evaluation of current
policies both within and outside
the University to which all stu-
dents and faculty are invited is
scheduled tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.
in Room 204 C1. Dr. Richard II.
McCoy, associate research pro-
fessor of Chemistry, will open
the discussion with a talk on
“What Do We Need?" and will
serve as moderator for state-
ments and questions from the
audience. K

Sponsored by the Graduate
Women's Student Association,
the open forum is the first of its
kind to be held here in some

While he doesn't claim to be

Rufus ll. Fitzgerald does admit
that the present crisis is not

Civil Defense Setup 

Out of Planning;

ROTC Recruits Vetsf

The fighting war in Korea and the diplomatic sorties in the
United Nations this week were becoming more than just discus-

sion topics for students.

On campus, the Civil Defense organization, under Viers
Adams, released air raid plans for the University in case an all-
out war grows out of the Korean situation. In line with the de-
fense program a special Red Cross first aid course will be offer-

ed to students next semester.

And reflecting the anticipated increased demand for officers,
both the Air and Army ROTC offered special courses for junior
and senior veterans who desire to enroll.

ROTC Ofers
Vets Deal

The ROTC department has some
good news for draft-conscious vet-
erans and third-year Air ROTC stu-
dents. *

.Both the Army and Air ROTC units
will accept vets who want to enter
in February. Quota limits will re-
strict~ the number of openings in the
air unit, but Col. Holland S. Robb,
head of the Army ROTC units here,
said: "I think we'll be able to take
all veterans who can qualify.”

Time Only ‘Limit

Vets who can pass the required
physical and mental tests can qual-
ify if they have a year or more in
service and enough time left in sch-
ool to complete training. The of-
fer made last fall, which promised
senior vets a commission for one
year of ROTC, is no longer‘ being
made. Vets now must take the com-
plete two year advanced course.

Air Force studentswho will com-
plete training or their academic
course on, or after, the end of the
1951-52 school year will not have
to go to summer camp this year,
according to Maj. Joseph A. Hoffman,
professor of air science and tactics.

“The 1951 summer camp will be
conducted only for students com-
pleting Air ROTC within the current
academic year or before the normal
end of the“‘193l-52 school year”
Maj. Hoffman explained.

Summer Attendance Cut

This new ruling will cut from sev-
enty-five to five\ the number of Pitt
Air ROTC students scheduled to
attend summer camp this year. Maj.
Hoffman was recently appointed to
direct the camp program in the First
Air Force area, which includes 41
schools in the northeastern part of
the U. 5.

All ROTC students, except
first semester freshmen, can be de-
ferred at their request until they
finish training.

Educators Concerned About Crisis

By ED JENSEN
Youthful undergraduates aren't the only people losing sleep
/over the draft and the war. The unhappy affliction also extends
up through the ranks to college professors and university chan-

sible.

Recognizing the importance of
the military_ service, the dele-
gates passed a resolution pledging
education’s support in evolving an

The chief topics on the agenda
accurately reflected the temper of
the educators, the Chancellor
said. In the preamble f the con-
vention report »  ‘
they faced the
possibility that
the present emer-
gency may in
reality be a
“long term emer-
gency,” lasting
. perhaps 30 years,
In light of such
a grave prospect
the educators
agreed that it A .

adequate training program, which
would insure "a constant flow of
trained personnel.” At the same
time they cautioned that we must
be ever alert that we do not lose
our liberties as a result of over-
zealous support of emergency
measures. “We must guard against
totalitarianism in the conduct of
the war,” they warned.

At the same time the group set
forth a series of resolutions which
would put the entire higher educa-
tional system into the war effort.
The report was accepted unani-
mously. This in itself reflects
the unusual times we live in Dr.
Fitzgerald pointed out, since

"Educators are not noted for
unanimity.” ”

Air Raid  
Plans Set

Viers W. Adams, director of civil
defense at Pitt, said in a recent
interview, “Pitt’s civil defense

program is progressing rapidly.

Plans to take care of the‘ first 12 '

floors of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, where the majority of people
are concentrated, are well under
way.”

According to Mr. Adams, the
general action in theievent of an
air attack will be to “get people

away from win-
dows and out
under the
roofs of.the pro-
jecting wings of
the Cathedral.”

The Univer-
sity is working

defense direct-
or for Allegheny
County, through the

.- Ada s

schools com-
mittee. The members of this com-
mittee represent all of the school

systems, universities, colleges,
and private schools in this area.
This is what has been ac-

complished under the civil defense
program at Pitt thus far;

1. A survey of floors up to
thirteen has been completed. A
floor plan has been drawn up which
shows where the people from each
room on that floor are to go when
the warning sounds.

2. A functional organization
headed by the Board of Trustees,
for civil defense has, been set-up.
Chancellor Fitzgerald is working
directly under the Board. E. A.
Batchelder and Carroll Reynolds
will work with Mr. Adams as as-
sistant directors for day and
evening respectively. Completing
the organization are committees on
Protective Services, Clyde Barton,
chairman; Training School, Arthur
Weigle, chairman; Physical Faci-
lities, Bruce Allen, chairman; and
Special Services, Agnes Starrett,
chairman.

3. Handbooks and irformative
pamphlets concerning all phases
of civil defense have been obtain-
ed and distributed to all committee
heads.

4. Mrs. Starrett has arranged to
have a special section set aside in
the library where students may
obtain books and pamphlets per-
taining to civil defense.

PANTHER LATE
The Panther will not be out un-
til the first week of next semes-
ter. According to Arthur Lopatin,
publicity director, the issue due
late this month has been post-
poned because of the proximity
of exam week. The next issue

is the ‘Anniversary Issue.’

By TIM KOVAR

The Dean of Men’s Office has divorced itself fro'm any author-

at the end of the orientation period.

frosh who did not take the exam as required, Theodore W. Biddle,

Ground Floor Rivals Feared

Men’s Cou.ncil’s bookstore will be

weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 1 pm.

dean of men, stated that he would
not endorse a letter to the offend-
ing frosh requiring them to take
the exam at a later date.

Crime and No Punishment
He based his resolution on the
fact that the dean’s office could

enforce no penalty on the fresh-
men if they failed to comply with

the instructions in the letter.

Mr. Biddle also stated that he
saw no reason to authorize and
enforce the threat since it was a
student project and did not fall
under the authority of the admini-
stration.

I,
Quite a Problem

This is the major snag facing
orientation‘ planners’ says Leonard
Baker, chairman of the Men’s
Council Customs and Traditions
committee. I

Other problems that have been
partly overcome include a ‘better’
system of running the orientation
classes. Baker plans to have rov-
ing counselors, outstanding mem-
bers of certain activities, who will
instruct the various classes at cer-
tain times.

bled last semester because the Un-
iversity store handled used books
for the first time and did not have

enough time to compile a stock of

used books.

If a book is not sold in a semes-
ter's time the MC Bookstore then re-
turns it to the student, Ecker says.

Men’s Council's store also sells
Panther auto tags for 50 cents and
book covers for 35 cents.

It was the sensible test.’ . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,
which simply asks you to try Camels as a steady snioke —

on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap judgments
needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels — and only \

gifting what you are doing.

 You should try to decide what you believe in and what you are
 for or against, as part of deciding what to do.

‘a University faculty member as the discussion leader. Billed (on

cussion of current policies both witlrin and outside the Univer-
sity,' it represents the first public airing of local gripes to be
‘ held in at least four years, to the best of our knowledge.

“ We hope to raise some of the points brought out in last week's
 Pitt News editorial page. We hope to hear some of the issues

The student body of the University of Pittsburgh, like any
other large group of people, has a generous share of chronic
grumblers. But Pitt’s grumblers, unlike those anywhere else,
are a particularly affectionate, warm-hearted species.

Their big beef about this citified school is that you "can’t

Since when were you in a posi-

He had done more good for this
country of ours than most other
men and that certainly includes
you.

He made no effort to convince
anyone he was “an educator” to
quote you. It was an honorary posi-
tion offered him more or less as a
token of appreciation and respect
from those that really know and
love him.

Such derogatory remarks as yours

It does my heart good to know that
the careers and perhaps even the
lives of thousands of students like
me might someday be affected by a.
decision of a “sober-minded, well-
informed" n_ational leader!

spots which concentrated pres-
sure -- not grumbling -- can smooth
out in time.

Today, as I find myself attend-

I figure it would not take me three
seconds to pick my school if I
had it to do over again. Frankly,
I don't know the words to the first
verse of the Alma Mater, but I
have become "intimate” with Pitt.

charges.
Instead, there was a good bit of

why his facts were so.

This fact emphasizes what I had
planned to say in today's column.

There is little reaction to a
charge of conformity and lack of
ambition because the average stu-
dent accepts these adjectives as
applying to him without any inten-
tion of disagreeing with them. He's
inclined to agree with Handlin and
settle back, quite satisfied to face
a lifetime in a government or cor-
ip oration office. '

What's the Why?

Why? Students of the
idealized a basic economic and
social security system in order
that individuals might go on to
greater achievements untroubled
by purely material worrie s. Handlin

’40’s have lost sight of the end
in the previous decade's means,
security.

Handlin wants to know why.

My answer is primarily one of
defense. I do not agree that my col-
lege generation does not have the
high hopes, dreams, and aspira-
tions of any other decade in hist-
ory, but these are not so apparent
because they are taken with more
than a grain of realism.

History forms the ideas and ac-
tions of people living through it,
and five years of hot, and five
years of cold war in the past ten
may be expected to cause a desire
in young people to get out from
under the strain._ They reach for
the quick and easy.

As forpthe future, students ap-
praise their childhood aspira-
tions (formed during the depres-
sion) and with a shrug, turn toward
security and conformity. And why
not? Isn't this being more realistic
than our fire-eating predecessors?

We have had an eyewitness op-
portunity to see_the past decade's
record of war, socialistic theory,

46 070 Shooting Downs Miami  
"Pitts Meet Grove City    
After 81-56 Victory

By WILL DOERGE
Pitt’s Panthers put on their best shooting display of the sea-
son at the Stadium last night as they walloped Miami of Florida,

15 IM Clubs
Undefeated

.(IM Leaders as of Thurs. Mom.)

The perennial Faculty Diehards
are on top of the heap this year in
the still-infant intramural basket-
ball season, with a 4-0 record in the
American League.

But Pitt’s "Braintrust” is not the
only team sporting a perfect record,
as some 15 teams are now undefeated.

Leaders in the fraterni_ty leagues
are Sigma Chi, Phi Gamma Delta,
Phi Delta Theta, Phi Epsilon Pi,
and the PiKA “B” five--all with
three wins.

Other winners of three contests
are'the Onyx, Munhall Indians, Pitt
"Yanks, Dukes, and the two pharm-
acy teams, .the ‘Mixers and the

Frosh.

With two wins and no losses are
the Law School, Chems, and the
Polecats.

Dukes Win Third

The Dazzling Dukes, last year’s
IM basketball champs, lived up to
their name and reputation as they
defeated a tough Little Jawn five,
29-27, Wednesday night in Trees
gym.

Both teams went into the game
with identical 2-0 records.

After a slow first period, the
Dukes led, 6-4, and they increased

' their lead to 18-14 at the half.

The Dukes were not to be denied
as they broke a 25*25 stalemate in
the closing minutes of play and
then went on to win, 29-27.

Ronnie Weinstein of the Dukes
was high-point man with six field
goals and two fouls for a total of
14 points.

pitiful Panthers made only 18 per
cent of their shots against Tech and

night's potent Panthers hit for 46
per cent.

Tonight Doc Carlson's five will
seek to continue their high scoring
ways as they play at Grove City.
Pitt now has a 3-12 record while
Grove City has a 3—4 mark.

Amazing Accuracy

The Panthers went on an amazing
shooting spree at the start of the
start of the second half, dropping
in 11 of 13 shots to stretch a 31-19
lead at halftime to 57-33 after ten
minutes.

Pitt’s overall shooting average
in the second half was a terrific 62
per cent. Miami's game percentage
yvas 26 per cent.

Mike Belich was again top scorer
for the Panthers, caging 19 points
before fouling out. His season total

if is now 238 points. -

Yurko, Zemich Sharp

Bob Yurko and Soph Mickey Zer-
nich also played exceptionally good
games, both hitting for 17 points.

Indicative of the type of game
played was the play of Miami's Bob
Schneidenbach, grid fullback, who
was on the floor more times than he
was tackled on the Stadium turf last
fall as a gridder.

Matmen Hope to

A State

To Revenge List Tomorrow

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

All future wrestling opponents have been alerted to watch out for

the avenging Panthers.

And this piece of advice should not be brushed aside casually.
So far this season Coach Rex Peery’s Wrestlers have avenged three

of last year’s defeats, and are set
to deliver the same treatment
against tomorrow's opponent, un-
defeated Penn State.

Coach Charlie Speidel’s all-
veteran team has defeated Lehigh
and the University of Virginia.

State defeated Pitt, 32-0, last.
year.

Tomorrow’s match is scheduled
for the Stadium Pavilion at 3 p.m.

Admission will 
be by student
ID card or 65

, cents. 
g “The Nitta- 7
nies,” accord-
ing to Peery,
"are one of the
toughest teams

in the East.”

The Panthers, 
however, hope to i 3,
do as well tomor- _ 
row as they did Sknpan
against Kent State last week.

The grapplers floored Kent State
21-7, before the largest crowd to
witness a wrestling match at the
Stadium in two years. Kent State
was undefeated in 17 matches pre-
vious to last Saturday.

Frank Skirpan, 147-pounder, re-
mained undefeated, running his
string to three straight. Ray Cap-
pelli, wrestling in the 130-pound

class, settled for a draw. "The
stalemate halted his string of
victories at four.

Other wrestlers’ records in-
cludezi

John George, three wins against
one setback; Harold Miller, fort
wins and one defeat; Jim “Doc”
Conklin, three wins, one loss and

a draw; Tony R'azzano, two wins,
one loss; and a draw; Harven
Kraqs,_ one draw; and Joe Kane,
one decision, one defeat, and a
draw.

In the heavyweight class, John
Masarik and Bill Ewing have fail-
ed to register a decision.

Tankers Prepare

lFor Three Foes

At present all is rosy on the Pitt
swimming scene after last week’s
surprise win over Rutgers, 41-34.
But the future may have something
else in store for Coach Ben Grady’s
tankers.

Three formidable foes will try to
hand Pitt’s natators their first de-
feat during the next three weeks. A
week from tomorrow Pitt will meet
Navy at Annapolis.

On Feb. 5 the Panthers face the
national collegiate champions, Ohio

m._-_

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

This piece will ‘probably -bore you. It is one of those farewell
addresses which college sports editors, upon their graduation,
feel compelled to write, although ‘there is no demand and little

excuse for such columns.

So I am warning you again: The
following may prove boring. If you
have nothing betterito do with your
time, then read on.

To begin with, our sports staff
has endeavored to be different from
those of most college newspapers
in that the gene-
ral tendency is to

produce rah-rah
sports sections
which leave the
athletes very
happy _ and the
readers very ‘un-
informed.

We have tried
to leave the pas-
sion to the cheer-
leaders. We have 
attempted to de- Carver
liver our stuff straight from the
shoulder.

Carver Rates High

At times, when we came upon
stories which were perhaps not
flattering to the Athletic Depart-
ment, we first listened to Mr.
Frank Carver (who handles sports
publicity) argue up and down and
crosswise as to why we should not
print what we knew.

That is his job.

Sometimes he convinced 115-
Sometimes he did not. When we dis-A
regarded his arguments, he made no
bones about our decisions, for he
knew that we were doing our job in
the manner we thought best. That
is one of the qualities which set
Frank Carver above the average
publicity man.

Carver does not rave, and he
does not give a reporter the old
dodge. His dealings are square.
Had they not been, Pitt’s public
relations might have been much
longer in recovering from the set-
backs suffered in the hectic "leak-
ing committee” days during which
the University sought a successor
to Athletic Director Jimmy Hagan.

Whatever success our sports de-
partment has enjoyed has been
partly due to Carver. Then, too,
there was Intramural Director Leo
Bemis, an ex-college editor him-
self and therefore a man in sym-
pathy with our problems.

Tremendous Headache
Bemis has a tremendous head-
ache in the management of an intra-
mural program at a school where
'\facilities are sadly lacking. .The
small creatures of the IM leagues
who go around griping over post-
ponements should try running the
works for a week. '

So our ‘staff thanks Leo Bemis for

his cooperation and commends
him for his work in IM sports.

And at this point, it should be
said that a sports editor is only
as good as the men working for
him. They make or break his sports
section. I have never been con-
cerned whether you, the reader,
werepleased with us or burned up
at us; but if our reporters have
given you an interesting, readable
sports section, then I personally
owe them a large debt of gratitude.
Doerge Forthright

Mr. Will Doerge, who succeeds
me, has been a forthright reporter,
and if I may be permitted to set my-
self up as a judge, Doerge will

give the reader a sports page with,

plenty of class.

In wrapping up my work here, I
might add that I am not without ap-
preciation of the helpful criticisms
of Mr._ Robert X. Graham and Miss
Emily Irvine of the English depart-

ment.

Again, I .express the hope that

 

    

our pages have held the reader’s
interest; but the expression of this
hope is perhaps superfluous, for
anyone who has waded this far
through my assemblage of per-
sonal trivia is certainly not hard
to satisfy.

Olson Appoints
Track Captains

Coach Carl Olson has appointed
Dick Firsching of Mount Lebanon
and Bob Arthurs of McKeesport as
co-captairs of the 1951 Pitt track
and field team.

Firsching was the leading point
scorer for the Panthers in 1950,
picking up 30 points in four dual

meets.

Arthurs has been a consistent
winner in the di§_c_us_ and shot put.

 

Pitt to Stick to Sanity Code,
States Director Hamilton

"Pitt will retain pretty much_ the
same rules regarding athletic re-
cruiting that existed under the
NCAA ‘Sanity Code.”

That's the way Tom Hamilton, ath-
leric director, sizes up the situation
here following his return from Dallas
where the constroversial code was
killed and live telecasting of foot-
ball games was banned‘.

The NCAA no longer possesses
‘any regulatory power over the con- ‘

duct of intercollegiate athletics.

"Recruiting standards are based
on fai¢ play,” said Hamilton, “and
we’ll stay within the same bounds
of decency as colleges of the same
academic standards.

"We will regulate our practices
to coincide with practices of the
teams We play.”‘ A

The Sanity Code had provided
that athletes could get their fees
and tuition under a scholarship,
but would have to work for room,
board and laundry.

The code was defeated by a vote
of l30‘6O at the Dallas convention.
